Kellerhoven\r\nand upwards of\r\n_Four Hundred Engravings on Wood_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe several successive editions of \"The Arts of the Middle Ages and Period\r\nof the Renaissance\" sufficiently testify to its appreciation by the\r\npublic. The object of that work was to introduce the reader to a branch of\r\nlearning to which access had hitherto appeared only permitted to the\r\nscientific. That attempt, which was a bold one, succeeded too well not to\r\ninduce us to push our researches further. In fact, art alone cannot\r\nacquaint us entirely with an epoch. \"The arts, considered in their\r\ngenerality, are the true expressions of society. They tell us its tastes,\r\nits ideas, and its character.\" We thus spoke in the preface to our first\r\nwork, and we find nothing to modify in this opinion. Art must be the\r\nfaithful expression of a society, since it represents it by its works as\r\nit has created them--undeniable witnesses of its spirit and manners for\r\nfuture generations. But it must be acknowledged that art is only the\r\nconsequence of the ideas which it expresses; it is the fruit of\r\ncivilisation, not its origin. To understand the Middle Ages and the\r\nRenaissance, it is necessary to go back to the source of its art, and to\r\nknow the life of our fathers; these are two inseparable things, which\r\nentwine one another, and become complete one by the other.\r\n\r\nThe Manners and Customs of the Middle Ages:--this subject is of the\r\ngreatest interest, not only to the man of science, but to the man of the\r\nworld also. In it, too, \"we retrace not only one single period, but two\r\nperiods quite distinct one from the other.\" In the first, the public and\r\nprivate customs offer a curious mixture of barbarism and civilisation. We\r\nfind barbarian, Roman, and Christian customs and character in presence of\r\neach other, mixed up in the same society, and very often in the same\r\nindividuals. Everywhere the most adverse and opposite tendencies display\r\nthemselves. What an ardent struggle during that long period! and how full,\r\ntoo, of emotion is its picture! Society tends to reconstitute itself in\r\nevery aspect. She wants to create, so to say, from every side, property,\r\nauthority, justice, &c., &c., in a word, everything which can establish\r\nthe basis of public life; and this new order of things must be established\r\nby means of the elements supplied at once by the barbarian, Roman, and\r\nChristian world--a prodigious creation, the working of which occupied the\r\nwhole of the Middle Ages. Hardly does modern society, civilised by\r\nChristianity, reach the fullness of its power, than it divides itself to\r\nfollow different paths. Ancient art and literature resuscitates because\r\ncustom _insensibly_ takes that direction. Under that influence, everything\r\nis modified both in private and public life. The history of the human race\r\ndoes not present a subject more vast or more interesting. It is a subject\r\nwe have chosen to succeed our first book, and which will be followed by a\r\nsimilar study on the various aspects of Religious and Military Life.\r\n\r\nThis work, devoted to the vivid and faithful description of the Manners\r\nand Customs of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, answers fully to the\r\nrequirements of contemporary times. We are, in fact, no longer content\r\nwith the chronological narration and simple nomenclatures which formerly\r\nwere considered sufficient for education. We no longer imagine that the\r\nhistory of our institutions has less interest than that of our wars, nor\r\nthat the annals of the humbler classes are irrelevant to those of the\r\nprivileged orders. We go further still. What is above all sought for in\r\nhistorical works nowadays is the physiognomy, the inmost character of past\r\ngenerations. \"How did our fathers live?\" is a daily question. \"What\r\ninstitutions had they? What were their political rights? Can you not\r\nplace before us their pastimes, their hunting parties, their meals, and\r\nall sorts of scenes, sad or gay, which composed their home life? We should\r\nlike to follow them in public and private occupations, and to know their\r\nmanner of living hourly, as we know our own.\"\r\n\r\nIn a high order of ideas, what great facts serve as a foundation to our\r\nhistory and that of the modern world! We have first royalty, which, weak\r\nand debased under the Merovingians, rises and establishes itself\r\nenergetically under Pépin and Charlemagne, to degenerate under Louis le\r\nDébonnaire and Charles le Chauve. After having dared a second time to\r\nfound the Empire of the Caesars, it quickly sees its sovereignty replaced\r\nby feudal rights, and all its rights usurped by the nobles, and has to\r\nstruggle for many centuries to recover its rights one by one.\r\n\r\nFeudalism, evidently of Germanic origin, will also attract our attention,\r\nand we shall draw a rapid outline of this legislation, which, barbarian at\r\nthe onset, becomes by degrees subject to the rules of moral progress. We\r\nshall ascertain that military service is the essence itself of the \"fief,\"\r\nand that thence springs feudal right. On our way we shall protest against\r\ncivil wars, and shall welcome emancipation and the formation of the\r\ncommunes. Following the thousand details of the life of the people, we\r\nshall see the slave become serf, and the serf become peasant. We shall\r\nassist at the dispensation of justice by royalty and nobility, at the\r\nsolemn sittings of parliaments, and we shall see the complicated details\r\nof a strict ceremonial, which formed an integral part of the law, develop\r\nthemselves before us. The counters of dealers, fairs and markets,\r\nmanufactures, commerce, and industry, also merit our attention; we must\r\nsearch deeply into corporations of workmen and tradesmen, examining their\r\nstatutes, and initiating ourselves into their business. Fashion and dress\r\nare also a manifestation of public and private customs; for that reason we\r\nmust give them particular attention.\r\n\r\nAnd to accomplish the work we have undertaken, we are lucky to have the\r\nconscientious studies of our old associates in the great work of the\r\nMiddle Ages and the Renaissance to assist us: such as those of Emile\r\nBégin, Elzéar Blaze, Depping, Benjamin Guérard, Le Roux de Lincy, H.\r\nMartin, Mary-Lafon, Francisque Michel, A. Monteil, Rabutau, Ferdinand\r\nSéré, Horace de Viel-Castel, A. de la Villegille, Vallet de Viriville.\r\n\r\nAs in the volume of the Arts of the Middle Ages, engraving and\r\nchromo-lithography will come to our assistance by reproducing, by means of\r\nstrict fac-similes, the rarest engravings of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, and the most precious miniatures of the manuscripts preserved\r\nin the principal libraries of France and Europe. Here again we have the\r\naid of the eminent artist, M. Kellerhoven, who quite recently found means\r\nof reproducing with so much fidelity the gems of Italian painting.\r\n\r\nPaul Lacroix\r\n(Bibliophile Jacob).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition of Persons and Lands\r\n\r\n\r\n  Disorganization of the West at the Beginning of the Middle\r\n  Ages.--Mixture of Roman, Germanic, and Gallic Institutions.--Fusion\r\n  organized under Charlemagne.--Royal Authority.--Position of the Great\r\n  Feudalists.--Division of the Territory and Prerogatives attached to\r\n  Landed Possessions.--Freeman and Tenants.--The Læti, the Colon, the\r\n  Serf, and the Labourer, who may be called the Origin of the Modern Lower\r\n  Classes.--Formation of Communities.--Right of Mortmain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivileges and Rights (Feudal and Municipal)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elements of Feudalism.--Rights of Treasure-trove, Sporting,\r\n  Safe-Conducts, Ransom, Disinheritance, &c.--Immunity of the\r\n  Feudalists.--Dues from the Nobles to their Sovereign.--Law and\r\n  University Dues.--Curious Exactions resulting from the Universal System\r\n  of Dues.--Struggles to enfranchise the Classes subjected to\r\n  Dues.--Feudal Spirit and Citizen Spirit.--Resuscitation of the System of\r\n  Ancient Municipalities in Italy, Germany, and France.--Municipal\r\n  Institutions and Associations.--The Community.--The Middle-Class Cities\r\n  (_Cités Bourgeoises_).--Origin of National Unity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Life in the Castles, the Towns, and the Rural Districts\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Merovingian Castles.--Pastimes of the Nobles: Hunting,\r\n  War.--Domestic Arrangements.--Private Life of Charlemagne.--Domestic\r\n  Habits under the Carlovingians.--Influence of Chivalry.--Simplicity of\r\n  the Court of Philip Augustus not imitated by his Successors.--Princely\r\n  Life of the Fifteenth Century.--The bringing up of Latour Landry, a\r\n  Noble of Anjou.--Varlets, Pages, Esquires, Maids of Honour.--Opulence of\r\n  the Bourgeoisie.--\"Le Ménagier de Paris.\"--Ancient Dwellings.--State of\r\n  Rustics at various Periods.--\"Rustic Sayings,\" by Noël du Fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood and Cookery\r\n\r\n\r\n  History of Bread.--Vegetables and Plants used in\r\n  Cooking.--Fruits.--Butchers' Meat.--Poultry, Game.--Milk, Butter,\r\n  Cheese, and Eggs.--Fish and Shellfish.--Beverages: Beer, Cider, Wine,\r\n  Sweet Wine, Refreshing Drinks, Brandy.--Cookery.--Soups, Boiled Food,\r\n  Pies, Stews, Salads, Roasts, Grills.--Seasoning, Truffles, Sugar,\r\n  Verjuice.--Sweets, Desserts, Pastry,--Meals and Feasts.--Rules of\r\n  Serving at Table from the Fifteenth to the Sixteenth Centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting\r\n\r\n\r\n  Venery and Hawking.--Origin of Aix-la-Chapelle.--Gaston Phoebus and his\r\n  Book.--The Presiding Deities of Sportsmen.--Sporting Societies and\r\n  Brotherhoods.--Sporting Kings: Charlemagne, Louis IX., Louis XI.,\r\n  Charles VIII., Louis XII., Francis I., &c.--Treatise on\r\n  Venery.--Sporting Popes.--Origin of Hawking.--Training Birds.--Hawking\r\n  Retinues.--Book of King Modus.--Technical Terms used in\r\n  Hawking.--Persons who have excelled in this kind of Sport.--Fowling.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames and Pastimes\r\n\r\n\r\n  Games of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.--Games of the Circus.--Animal\r\n  Combats.--Daring of King Pepin.--The King's Lions.--Blind Men's\r\n  Fights.--Cockneys of Paris.--Champ de Mars.--Cours Plénières and Cours\r\n  Couronnées.--Jugglers, Tumblers, and\r\n  Minstrels.--Rope-dancers.--Fireworks.--Gymnastics.--Cards and\r\n  Dice.--Chess, Marbles, and Billiards.--La Soule, La Pirouette,\r\n  &c.--Small Games for Private Society.--History of Dancing.--Ballet des\r\n  Ardents.--The \"Orchésographie\" (Art of Dancing) of Thoinot Arbeau.--List\r\n  of Dances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommerce\r\n\r\n\r\n  State of Commerce after the Fall of the Roman Empire;

It began in 476, on the fall of Agustulus, and ended in\r\n1453, at the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II., and consequently the\r\nfall of two empires, that of the West and that of the East, marks its\r\nduration. Its first act, which was due to the Germans, was the destruction\r\nof political unity, and this was destined to be afterwards replaced by\r\nreligions unity. Then we find a multitude of scattered and disorderly\r\ninfluences growing on the ruins of central power. The yoke of imperial\r\ndominion was broken by the barbarians; but the populace, far from\r\nacquiring liberty, fell to the lowest degrees of servitude. Instead of one\r\ndespot, it found thousands of tyrants, and it was but slowly and with\r\nmuch trouble that it succeeded in freeing itself from feudalism. Nothing\r\ncould be more strangely troubled than the West at the time of the\r\ndissolution of the Empire of the Caesars; nothing more diverse or more\r\ndiscordant than the interests, the institutions, and the state of society,\r\nwhich were delivered to the Germans (Figs. 1 and 2). In fact, it would be\r\nimpossible in the whole pages of history to find a society formed of more\r\nheterogeneous or incompatible elements. On the one side might be placed\r\nthe Goths, Burgundians, Vandals, Germans, Franks, Saxons, and Lombards,\r\nnations, or more strictly hordes, accustomed to rough and successful\r\nwarfare, and, on the other, the Romans, including those people who by long\r\nservitude to Roman dominion had become closely allied with their\r\nconquerors (Fig. 3). There were, on both sides, freemen, freedmen, colons,\r\nand slaves; different ranks and degrees being, however, observable both in\r\nfreedom and servitude. This hierarchical principle applied itself even to\r\nthe land, which was divided into freeholds, tributary lands, lands of the\r\nnobility, and servile lands, thus constituting the freeholds, the\r\nbenefices, the fiefs, and the tenures. It may be added that the customs,\r\nand to a certain degree the laws, varied according to the masters of the\r\ncountry, so that it can hardly be wondered at that everywhere diversity\r\nand inequality were to be found, and, as a consequence, that anarchy and\r\nconfusion ruled supreme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 1 and 2.--Costumes of the Franks from the Fourth to\r\nthe Eighth Centuries, collected by H. de Vielcastel, from original\r\nDocuments in the great Libraries of Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Costumes of Roman Soldiers. Fig. 4.--Costume of\r\nGerman Soldiers. From Miniatures on different Manuscripts, from the Sixth\r\nto the Twelfth Centuries.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans (Fig. 4) had brought with them over the Rhine none of the\r\nheroic virtues attributed to them by Tacitus when he wrote their history,\r\nwith the evident intention of making a satire on his countrymen. Amongst\r\nthe degenerate Romans whom those ferocious Germans had subjugated,\r\ncivilisation was reconstituted on the ruins of vices common in the early\r\nhistory of a new society by the adoption of a series of loose and\r\ndissolute habits, both by the conquerors and the conquered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Costumes of Slaves or Serfs, from the Sixth to the\r\nTwelfth Centuries, collected by H. de Vielcastel, from original Documents\r\nin the great Libraries of Europe.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the conquerors contributed the worse share (Fig. 5); for, whilst\r\nexercising the low and debasing instincts of their former barbarism, they\r\nundertook the work of social reconstruction with a sort of natural and\r\ninnate servitude. To them, liberty, the desire for which caused them to\r\nbrave the greatest dangers, was simply the right of doing evil--of obeying\r\ntheir ardent thirst for plunder. Long ago, in the depths of their forests,\r\nthey had adopted the curious institution of vassalage. When they came to\r\nthe West to create States, instead of reducing personal power, every step\r\nin their social edifice, from the top to the bottom, was made to depend on\r\nindividual superiority. To bow to a superior was their first political\r\nprinciple; and on that principle feudalism was one day to find its base.\r\n\r\nServitude was in fact to be found in all conditions and ranks, equally in\r\nthe palace of the sovereign as in the dwellings of his subjects. The\r\nvassal who was waited on at his own table by a varlet, himself served at\r\nthe table of his lord; the nobles treated each other likewise, according\r\nto their rank; and all the exactions which each submitted to from his\r\nsuperiors, and required to be paid to him by those below him, were looked\r\nupon not as onerous duties, but as rights and honours. The sentiment of\r\ndignity and of personal independence, which has become, so to say, the\r\nsoul of modern society, did not exist at all, or at least but very\r\nslightly, amongst the Germans. If we could doubt the fact, we have but to\r\nremember that these men, so proud, so indifferent to suffering or death,\r\nwould often think little of staking their liberty in gambling, in the hope\r\nthat if successful their gain might afford them the means of gratifying\r\nsome brutal passion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--King or Chief of Franks armed with the Seramasax,\r\nfrom a Miniature of the Ninth Century, drawn by H. de Vielcastel.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Franks took root in Gaul, their dress and institutions were\r\nadopted by the Roman society (Fig. 6). This had the most disastrous\r\ninfluence in every point of view, and it is easy to prove that\r\ncivilisation did not emerge from this chaos until by degrees the Teutonic\r\nspirit disappeared from the world. As long as this spirit reigned, neither\r\nprivate nor public liberty existed. Individual patriotism only extended as\r\nfar as the border of a man's family, and the nation became broken up into\r\nclans. Gaul soon found itself parcelled off into domains which were\r\nalmost independent of one another. It was thus that Germanic genius became\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--The King of the Franks, in the midst of the\r\nMilitary Chiefs who formed his _Treuste_, or armed Court, dictates the\r\nSalic Law (Code of the Barbaric Laws).--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the\r\n\"Chronicles of St. Denis,\" a Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century (Library\r\nof the Arsenal).]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of acting together for mutual protection first established\r\nitself in families. If any one suffered from an act of violence, he laid\r\nthe matter before his relatives for them jointly to seek reparation. The\r\nquestion was then settled between the families of the offended person and\r\nthe offender, all of whom were equally associated in the object of\r\nvindicating a cause which interested them alone, without recognising any\r\nestablished authority, and without appealing to the law. If the parties\r\nhad sought the protection or advice of men of power, the quarrel might at\r\nonce take a wider scope, and tend to kindle a feud between two nobles. In\r\nany case the King only interfered when the safety of his person or the\r\ninterests of his dominions were threatened.\r\n\r\nPenalties and punishments were almost always to be averted by a money\r\npayment. A son, for instance, instead of avenging the death of his\r\nfather, received from the murderer a certain indemnity in specie,\r\naccording to legal tariff; and the law was thus satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of indemnities or compensations to be paid for each crime\r\nformed the basis of the code of laws amongst the principal tribes of\r\nFranks, a code essentially barbarian, and called the Salic law, or law of\r\nthe Salians (Fig. 7). Such, however, was the spirit of inequality among\r\nthe German races, that it became an established principle for justice to\r\nbe subservient to the rank of individuals. The more powerful a man was,\r\nthe more he was protected by the law; the lower his rank, the less the law\r\nprotected him.\r\n\r\nThe life of a Frank, by right, was worth twice that of a Roman; the life\r\nof a servant of the King was worth three times that of an ordinary\r\nindividual who did not possess that protecting tie. On the other hand,\r\npunishment was the more prompt and rigorous according to the inferiority\r\nof position of the culprit. In case of theft, for instance, a person of\r\nimportance was brought before the King's tribunal, and as it respected the\r\nrank held by the accused in the social hierarchy, little or no punishment\r\nwas awarded. In the case of the same crime by a poor man, on the contrary,\r\nthe ordinary judge gave immediate sentence, and he was seized and hung on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as no political institutions amongst the Germans were nobler or\r\nmore just than those of the Franks and the other barbaric races, we cannot\r\naccept the creed of certain historians who have represented the Germans as\r\nthe true regenerators of society in Europe. The two sources of modern\r\ncivilisation are indisputably Pagan antiquity and Christianity.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Merovingian kings great progress was made in the\r\npolitical and social state of nations. These kings, who were but chiefs of\r\nundisciplined bands, were unable to assume a regal character, properly so\r\ncalled. Their authority was more personal than territorial, for incessant\r\nchanges were made in the boundaries of their conquered dominions. It was\r\ntherefore with good reason that they styled themselves kings of the\r\nFranks, and not kings of France.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne was the first who recognised that social union, so admirable\r\nan example of which was furnished by Roman organization, and who was able,\r\nwith the very elements of confusion and disorder to which he succeeded, to\r\nunite, direct, and consolidate diverging and opposite forces, to establish\r\nand regulate public administrations, to found and build towns, and to\r\nform and reconstruct almost a new world (Fig. 8). We hear of him assigning\r\nto each his place, creating for all a common interest, making of a crowd\r\nof small and scattered peoples a great and powerful nation; in a word,\r\nrekindling the beacon of ancient civilisation. When he died, after a most\r\nactive and glorious reign of forty-five years, he left an immense empire\r\nin the most perfect state of peace (Fig. 9). But this magnificent\r\ninheritance was unfortunately destined to pass into unworthy or impotent\r\nhands, so that society soon fell back into anarchy and confusion. The\r\nnobles, in their turn invested with power, were continually at war, and\r\ngradually weakened the royal authority--the power of the kingdom--by their\r\nendless disputes with the Crown and with one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Charles, eldest Son of King Pepin, receives the\r\nNews of the Death of his Father and the Great Feudalists offer him the\r\nCrown.--Costumes of the Court of Burgundy in the Fifteenth\r\nCentury.--Fac-simile of a Miniature of the \"History of the Emperors\"\r\n(Library of the Arsenal).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Portrait of Charlemagne, whom the Song of Roland\r\nnames the King with the Grizzly Beard.--Fac-simile of an Engraving of the\r\nEnd of the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe revolution in society which took place under the Carlovingian dynasty\r\nhad for its especial object that of rendering territorial what was\r\nformerly personal, and, as it were, of destroying personality in matters\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nThe usurpation of lands by the great having been thus limited by the\r\ninfluence of the lesser holders, everybody tried to become the holder of\r\nland. Its possession then formed the basis of social position, and, as a\r\nconsequence, individual servitude became lessened, and society assumed a\r\nmore stable condition. The ancient laws of wandering tribes fell into\r\ndisuse; and at the same time many distinctions of caste and race\r\ndisappeared, as they were incompatible with the new order of things. As\r\nthere were no more Salians, Ripuarians, nor Visigoths among the free men,\r\nso there were no more colons, læti, nor slaves amongst those deprived of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: Figs. 10 and 11.--Present State of the Feudal Castle of\r\nChateau-Gaillard aux Andelys, which was considered one of the strongest\r\nCastles of France in the Middle Ages, and was rebuilt in the Twelfth\r\nCentury by Richard Coeur de Lion.]\r\n\r\nHeads of families, on becoming attached to the soil, naturally had other\r\nwants and other customs than those which they had delighted in when they\r\nwere only the chiefs of wandering adventurers. The strength of their\r\nfollowers was not now so important to them as the security of their\r\ncastles. Fortresses took the place of armed bodies; and at this time,\r\nevery one who wished to keep what he had, entrenched himself to the best\r\nof his ability at his own residence. The banks of rivers, elevated\r\npositions, and all inaccessible heights, were occupied by towers and\r\ncastles, surrounded by ditches, which served as strongholds to the lords\r\nof the soil. (Figs. 10 and 11). These places of defence soon became points\r\nfor attack. Out of danger at home, many of the nobles kept watch like\r\nbirds of prey on the surrounding country, and were always ready to fall,\r\nnot only upon their enemies, but also on their neighbours, in the hope\r\neither of robbing them when off their guard, or of obtaining a ransom for\r\nany unwary traveller who might fall into their hands. Everywhere society\r\nwas in ambuscade, and waged civil war--individual against\r\nindividual--without peace or mercy. Such was the reign of feudalism. It is\r\nunnecessary to point out how this system of perpetual petty warfare tended\r\nto reduce the power of centralisation, and how royalty itself was\r\nweakened towards the end of the second dynasty. When the descendants of\r\nHugh Capet wished to restore their power by giving it a larger basis, they\r\nwere obliged to attack, one after the other, all these strongholds, and\r\npractically to re-annex each fief, city, and province held by these petty\r\nmonarchs, in order to force their owners to recognise the sovereignty of\r\nthe King. Centuries of war and negotiations became necessary before the\r\nkingdom of France could be, as it were, reformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Knights and Men-at-arms, cased in Mail, in the\r\nReign of Louis le Gros, from a Miniature in a Psalter written towards the\r\nEnd of the Twelfth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe corporations and the citizens had great weight in restoring the\r\nmonarchical power, as well as in forming French nationality; but by far\r\nthe best influence brought to bear in the Middle Ages was that of\r\nChristianity. The doctrine of one origin and of one final destiny being\r\ncommon to all men of all classes constantly acted as a strong inducement\r\nfor thinking that all should be equally free. Religious equality paved the\r\nway for political equality, and as all Christians were brothers before\r\nGod, the tendency was for them to become, as citizens, equal also in law.\r\n\r\nThis transformation, however, was but slow, and followed concurrently the\r\nprogress made in the security of property. At the onset, the slave only\r\npossessed his life, and this was but imperfectly guaranteed to him by the\r\nlaws of charity; laws which, however, year by year became of greater\r\npower. He afterwards became _colon_, or labourer (Figs. 13 and 14),\r\nworking for himself under certain conditions and tenures, paying fines, or\r\nservices, which, it is true, were often very extortionate. At this time he\r\nwas considered to belong to the domain on which he was born, and he was at\r\nleast sure that that soil would not be taken from him, and that in giving\r\npart of his time to his master, he was at liberty to enjoy the rest\r\naccording to his fancy. The farmer afterwards became proprietor of the\r\nsoil he cultivated, and master, not only of himself, but of his lands;\r\ncertain trivial obligations or fines being all that was required of him,\r\nand these daily grew less, and at last disappeared altogether. Having thus\r\nobtained a footing in society, he soon began to take a place in provincial\r\nassemblies; and he made the last bound on the road of social progress,\r\nwhen the vote of his fellow-electors sent him to represent them in the\r\nparliament of the kingdom. Thus the people who had begun by excessive\r\nservitude, gradually climbed to power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Labouring Colons (Twelfth Century), after a\r\nMiniature in a Manuscript of the Ste. Chapelle, of the National Library of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nWe will now describe more in detail the various conditions of persons of\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe King, who held his rights by birth, and not by election, enjoyed\r\nrelatively an absolute authority, proportioned according to the power of\r\nhis abilities, to the extent of his dominions, and to the devotion of his\r\nvassals. Invested with a power which for a long time resembled the command\r\nof a general of an army, he had at first no other ministers than the\r\nofficers to whom he gave full power to act in the provinces, and who\r\ndecided arbitrarily in the name of, and representing, the King, on all\r\nquestions of administration. One minister alone approached the King, and\r\nthat was the chancellor, who verified, sealed, and dispatched all royal\r\ndecrees and orders.\r\n\r\nAs early, however, as the seventh century, a few officers of state\r\nappeared, who were specially attached to the King's person or household; a\r\ncount of the palace, who examined and directed the suits brought before\r\nthe throne; a mayor of the palace, who at one time raised himself from the\r\nadministration of the royal property to the supreme power; an\r\narch-chaplain, who presided over ecclesiastical affairs; a lord of the\r\nbedchamber, charged with the treasure of the chamber; and a count of the\r\nstables, charged with the superintendence of the stables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Labouring Colons (Twelfth Century), after a\r\nMiniature in a Manuscript of the Ste. Chapelle, of the National Library of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nFor all important affairs, the King generally consulted the grandees of\r\nhis court; but as in the five or six first centuries of monarchy in France\r\nthe royal residence was not permanent, it is probable the Council of State\r\nwas composed in part of the officers who followed the King, and in part of\r\nthe noblemen who came to visit him, or resided near the place he happened\r\nto be inhabiting. It was only under the Capetians that the Royal Council\r\ntook a permanent footing, or even assembled at stated periods.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary times, that is to say, when he was not engaged in war, the\r\nKing had few around him besides his family, his personal attendants, and\r\nthe ministers charged with the dispatch of affairs. As he changed from\r\none of his abodes to another he only held his court on the great festivals\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--The Lords and Barons prove their Nobility by\r\nhanging their Banners and exposing their Coats-of-arms at the Windows of\r\nthe Lodge of the Heralds.--After a Miniature of the \"Tournaments of King\r\nRéné\" (Fifteenth Century), MSS. of the National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nUp to the thirteenth century, there was, strictly speaking, no taxation\r\nand no public treasury. The King received, through special officers\r\nappointed for the purpose, tributes either in money or in kind, which\r\nwere most variable, but often very heavy, and drawn almost exclusively\r\nfrom his personal and private properties. In cases of emergency only, he\r\nappealed to his vassals for pecuniary aid. A great number of the grandees,\r\nwho lived far from the court, either in state offices or on their own\r\nfiefs, had establishments similar to that of the King. Numerous and\r\nconsiderable privileges elevated them above other free men. The offices\r\nand fiefs having become hereditary, the order of nobility followed as a\r\nconsequence; and it then became highly necessary for families to keep\r\ntheir genealogical histories, not only to gratify their pride, but also to\r\ngive them the necessary titles for the feudal advantages they derived by\r\nbirth. (Fig. 15). Without this right of inheritance, society, which was\r\nstill unsettled in the Middle Ages, would soon have been dissolved. This\r\ngreat principle, sacred in the eyes both of great and small, maintained\r\nfeudalism, and in so doing it maintained itself amidst all the chaos and\r\nconfusion of repeated revolutions and social disturbances.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated, and we cannot sufficiently insist upon this\r\nimportant point, that from the day on which the adventurous habits of the\r\nchiefs of Germanic origin gave place to the desire for territorial\r\npossessions, the part played by the land increased insensibly towards\r\ndefining the position of the persons holding it. Domains became small\r\nkingdoms, over which the lord assumed the most absolute and arbitrary\r\nrights. A rule was soon established, that the nobility was inherent to the\r\nsoil, and consequently that the land ought to transmit to its possessors\r\nthe rights of nobility.\r\n\r\nThis privilege was so much accepted, that the long tenure of a fief ended\r\nby ennobling the commoner. Subsequently, by a sort of compensation which\r\nnaturally followed, lands on which rent had hitherto been paid became free\r\nand noble on passing to the possession of a noble. At last, however, the\r\ncontrary rule prevailed, which caused the lands not to change quality in\r\nchanging owners: the noble could still possess the labourers's lands\r\nwithout losing his nobility, but the labourer could be proprietor of a\r\nfief without thereby becoming a noble.\r\n\r\nTo the _comites_, who, according to Tacitus, attached themselves to the\r\nfortunes of the Germanic chiefs, succeeded the Merovingian _leudes_, whose\r\nassembly formed the King's Council. These _leudes_ were persons of great\r\nimportance owing to the number of their vassals, and although they\r\ncomposed his ordinary Council, they did not hesitate at times to declare\r\nthemselves openly opposed to his will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Knight in War-harness, after a Miniature in a\r\nPsalter written and illuminated under Louis le Gros.]\r\n\r\nThe name of _leudes_ was abandoned under the second of the then French\r\ndynasties, and replaced by that of _fidèles_, which, in truth soon became\r\na common designation of both the vassals of the Crown and those of the\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nUnder the kings of the third dynasty, the kingdom was divided into about\r\none hundred and fifty domains, which were called great fiefs of the crown,\r\nand which were possessed in hereditary right by the members of the highest\r\nnobility, placed immediately under the royal sovereignty and dependence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--King Charlemagne receiving the Oath of Fidelity\r\nand Homage from one of his great Feudatories or High Barons.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Miniature in Cameo, of the \"Chronicles of St. Denis.\" Manuscript of\r\nthe Fourteenth Century (Library of the Arsenal).]\r\n\r\nVassals emanating directly from the King, were then generally designated\r\nby the title of _barons_, and mostly possessed strongholds. The other\r\nnobles indiscriminately ranked as _chevaliers_ or _cnights_, a generic\r\ntitle, to which was added that of _banneret_, The fiefs of _hauberk_ were\r\nbound to supply the sovereign with a certain number of knights covered\r\nwith coats of mail, and completely armed. All knights were mounted in war\r\n(Fig. 16); but knights who were made so in consequence of their high birth\r\nmust not be confounded with those who became knights by some great feat in\r\narms in the house of a prince or high noble, nor with the members of the\r\ndifferent orders of chivalry which were successively instituted, such as\r\nthe Knights of the Star, the Genet, the Golden Fleece, Saint-Esprit, St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem, &c. Originally, the possession of a benefice or fief\r\nmeant no more than the privilege of enjoying the profits derived from the\r\nland, a concession which made the holder dependent upon the proprietor. He\r\nwas in fact his \"man,\" to whom he owed homage (Fig. 17), service in case\r\nof war, and assistance in any suit the proprietor might have before the\r\nKing's tribunal. The chiefs of German bands at first recompensed their\r\ncompanions in arms by giving them fiefs of parts of the territory which\r\nthey had conquered; but later on, everything was equally given to be held\r\nin fief, namely, dignities, offices, rights, and incomes or titles.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remark (and it is in this alone that feudalism shows\r\nits social bearing), that if the vassal owed obedience and devotion to his\r\nlord, the lord in exchange owed protection to the vassal. The rank of\r\n\"free man\" did not necessarily require the possession of land; but the\r\nposition of free men who did not hold fiefs was extremely delicate and\r\noften painful, for they were by natural right dependent upon those on\r\nwhose domain they resided. In fact, the greater part of these nobles\r\nwithout lands became by choice the King's men, and remained attached to\r\nhis service. If this failed them, they took lands on lease, so as to\r\nsupport themselves and their families, and to avoid falling into absolute\r\nservitude. In the event of a change of proprietor, they changed with the\r\nland into new hands. Nevertheless, it was not uncommon for them to be so\r\nreduced as to sell their freedom; but in such cases, they reserved the\r\nright, should better times come, of re-purchasing their liberty by paying\r\none-fifth more than the sum for which they had sold it.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that in olden times, as also later, freedom was more or less\r\nthe natural consequence of the possession of wealth or power on the part\r\nof individuals or families who considered themselves free in the midst of\r\ngeneral dependence. During the tenth century, indeed, if not impossible,\r\nit was at least difficult to find a single inhabitant of the kingdom of\r\nFrance who was not \"the man\" of some one, and who was either tied by rules\r\nof a liberal order, or else was under the most servile obligations.\r\n\r\nThe property of the free men was originally the \"_aleu_,\" which was under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the royal magistrates. The _aleu_ gradually lost the\r\ngreater part of its franchise, and became liable to the common charges due\r\non lands which were not freehold.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, all landed property of a certain extent was composed of\r\ntwo distinct parts: one occupied by the owner, constituted the domain or\r\nmanor; the other, divided between persons who were more or less dependent,\r\nformed what were called _tenures_. These _tenures_ were again divided\r\naccording to the position of those who occupied them: if they were\r\npossessed by free men, who took the name of vassals, they were called\r\nbenefices or fiefs; if they were let to læti, colons, or serfs, they were\r\nthen called colonies or demesnes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Ploughmen.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in a very\r\nancient Anglo-Saxon Manuscript published by Shaw, with legend \"God Spede\r\nye Plough, and send us Korne enow.\"]\r\n\r\nThe _læti_ occupied a rank between the colon and the serf. They had less\r\nliberty than the colon, over whom the proprietor only had an indirect and\r\nvery limited power. The colon only served the land, whilst the læti,\r\nwhether agriculturists or servants, served both the land and the owner\r\n(Fig. 18). They nevertheless enjoyed the right of possession, and of\r\ndefending themselves, or prosecuting by law. The serf, on the contrary,\r\nhad neither city, tribunal, nor family. The læti had, besides, the power\r\nof purchasing their liberty when they had amassed sufficient for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n_Serfs_ occupied the lowest position in the social ladder (Fig. 19). They\r\nsucceeded to slaves, thus making, thanks to Christianity, a step towards\r\nliberty. Although the civil laws barely protected them, those of the\r\nChurch continually stepped in and defended them from arbitrary despotism.\r\nThe time came when they had no direct masters, and when the almost\r\nabsolute dependence of serfs was changed by the nobles requiring them to\r\nfarm the land and pay tithes and fees. And lastly, they became farmers,\r\nand regular taxes took the place of tithes and fees.\r\n\r\nThe colons, læti, and serfs, all of whom were more or less tillers of the\r\nsoil, were, so to speak, the ancestors of \"the people\" of modern times;\r\nthose who remained devoted to agriculture were the ancestors of our\r\npeasants; and those who gave themselves up to trades and commerce in the\r\ntowns, were the originators of the middle classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Serf or Vassal of Tenth Century, from\r\nMiniatures in the \"Dialogues of St. Gregory,\" Manuscript No. 9917 (Royal\r\nLibrary of Brussels).]\r\n\r\nAs early as the commencement of the third royal dynasty we find in the\r\nrural districts, as well as in the towns, a great number of free men: and\r\nas the charters concerning the condition of lands and persons became more\r\nand more extended, the tyranny of the great was reduced, and servitude\r\ndecreased. During the following centuries, the establishment of civic\r\nbodies and the springing up of the middle classes (Fig. 20) made the\r\nacquisition of liberty more easy and more general. Nevertheless, this\r\nliberty was rather theoretical than practical; for if the nobles granted\r\nit nominally, they gave it at the cost of excessive fines, and the\r\ncommunity, which purchased at a high price the right of\r\nself-administration, did not get rid of any of the feudal charges imposed\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Bourgeois at the End of Thirteenth\r\nCentury.--Fac-simile of Miniature in Manuscript No. 6820, in the National\r\nLibrary of Paris.]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the progress of liberty, the civic bodies, as if they had\r\nbeen providentially warned of the future in store for them, never\r\nhesitated to accept from their lords, civil or ecclesiastical, conditions,\r\nonerous though they were, which enabled them to exist in the interior of\r\nthe cities to which they belonged. They formed a sort of small state,\r\nalmost independent for private affairs, subject to the absolute power of\r\nthe King, and more or less tied by their customs or agreements with the\r\nlocal nobles. They held public assemblies and elected magistrates, whose\r\npowers embraced both the administration of civil and criminal justice,\r\npolice, finance, and the militia. They generally had fixed and written\r\nlaws. Protected by ramparts, each possessed a town-hall (_hôtel de\r\nville_), a seal, a treasury, and a watch-tower, and it could arm a certain\r\nnumber of men, either for its own defence or for the service of the noble\r\nor sovereign under whom it held its rights.\r\n\r\nIn no case could a community such as this exist without the sanction of\r\nthe King, who placed it under the safeguard of the Crown. At first the\r\nkings, blinded by a covetous policy, only seemed to see in the issue of\r\nthese charters an excellent pretext for extorting money. If they consented\r\nto recognise them, and even to help them against their lords, it was on\r\naccount of the enormous sacrifices made by the towns. Later on, however,\r\nthey affected, on the contrary, the greatest generosity towards the\r\nvassals who wished to incorporate themselves, when they had understood\r\nthat these institutions might become powerful auxiliaries against the\r\ngreat titulary feudalists; but from the reign of Louis XI., when the power\r\nof the nobles was much diminished, and no longer inspired any terror to\r\nroyalty, the kings turned against their former allies, the middle classes,\r\nand deprived them successively of all the prerogatives which could\r\nprejudice the rights of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe middle classes, it is true, acquired considerable influence afterwards\r\nby participation in the general and provincial councils. After having\r\nvictoriously struggled against the clergy and nobility, in the assemblies\r\nof the three states or orders, they ended by defeating royalty itself.\r\n\r\nLouis le Gros, in whose orders the style or title of _bourgeois_ first\r\nappears (1134), is generally looked upon as the founder of the franchise\r\nof communities in France; but it is proved that a certain number of\r\ncommunities or corporations were already formally constituted, before his\r\naccession to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe title of bourgeois was not, however, given exclusively to inhabitants\r\nof cities. It often happened that the nobles, with the intention of\r\nimproving and enriching their domains, opened a kind of asylum, under the\r\nattractive title of _Free Towns_, or _New Towns_, where they offered, to\r\nall wishing to establish themselves, lands, houses, and a more or less\r\nextended share of privileges, rights, and liberties. These congregations,\r\nor families, soon became boroughs, and the inhabitants, though\r\nagriculturists, took the name of bourgeois.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Costume of a Vilain or Peasant, Fifteenth\r\nCentury, from a Miniature of \"La Danse Macabre,\" Manuscript 7310 of the\r\nNational Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThere was also a third kind of bourgeois, whose influence on the extension\r\nof royal power was not less than that of the others. There were free\r\nmen who, under the title of bourgeois of the King _(bourgeois du Roy_),\r\nkept their liberty by virtue of letters of protection given them by the\r\nKing, although they were established on lands of nobles whose inhabitants\r\nwere deprived of liberty. Further, when a _vilain_--that is to say, the\r\nserf, of a noble--bought a lease of land in a royal borough, it was an\r\nestablished custom that after having lived there a year and a day without\r\nbeing reclaimed by his lord and master, he became a bourgeois of the King\r\nand a free man. In consequence of this the serfs and vilains (Fig. 21)\r\nemigrated from all parts, in order to profit by these advantages, to such\r\na degree, that the lands of the nobles became deserted by all the serfs of\r\ndifferent degrees, and were in danger of remaining uncultivated. The\r\nnobility, in the interests of their properties, and to arrest this\r\nincreasing emigration, devoted themselves to improving the condition of\r\npersons placed under their dependence, and attempted to create on their\r\ndomains _boroughs_ analogous to those of royalty. But however liberal\r\nthese ameliorations might appear to be, it was difficult for the nobles\r\nnot only to concede privileges equal to those emanating from the throne,\r\nbut also to ensure equal protection to those they thus enfranchised. In\r\nspite of this, however, the result was that a double current of\r\nenfranchisement was established, which resulted in the daily diminution of\r\nthe miserable order of serfs, and which, whilst it emancipated the lower\r\norders, had the immediate result of giving increased weight and power to\r\nroyalty, both in its own domains and in those of the nobility and their\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nThese social revolutions did not, of course, operate suddenly, nor did\r\nthey at once abolish former institutions, for we still find, that after\r\nthe establishment of communities and corporations, several orders of\r\nservitude remained.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the thirteenth century, on the authority of Philippe de\r\nBeaumanoir, the celebrated editor of \"Coutumes de Beauvoisis,\" there were\r\nthree states or orders amongst the laity, namely, the nobleman (Fig. 22),\r\nthe free man, and the serf. All noblemen were free, but all free men were\r\nnot necessarily noblemen. Generally, nobility descended from the father\r\nand franchise from the mother. But according to many other customs of\r\nFrance, the child, as a general rule, succeeded to the lower rank of his\r\nparents. There were two orders of serfs: one rigorously held in the\r\nabsolute dependence of his lord, to such a degree that the latter could\r\nappropriate during his life, or after death if he chose, all he possessed;\r\nhe could imprison him, ill-treat him as he thought proper, without having\r\nto answer to any one but God; the other, though held equally in bondage,\r\nwas more liberally treated, for \"unless he was guilty of some evil-doing,\r\nthe lord could ask of him nothing during his life but the fees, rents, or\r\nfines which he owed on account of his servitude.\" If one of the latter\r\nclass of serfs married a free woman, everything which he possessed became\r\nthe property of his lord. The same was the case when he died, for he could\r\nnot transmit any of his goods to his children, and was only allowed to\r\ndispose by will of a sum of about five sous, or about twenty-five francs\r\nof modern money.\r\n\r\nAs early as the fourteenth century, serfdom or servitude no longer existed\r\nexcept in \"mortmain,\" of which we still have to speak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Court of Mary of Anjou, Wife of Charles VII.\r\n\r\nHer chaplain the learned Robert Blondel presents her with the allegorical\r\nTreatise of the \"_Twelve Perils of Hell_.\" Which he composed for her\r\n(1455). Fac-simile of a miniature from this work. Bibl. de l'Arsenal,\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\n_Mortmain_ consisted of the privation of the right of freely disposing\r\nof one's person or goods. He who had not the power of going where he\r\nwould, of giving or selling, of leaving by will or transferring his\r\nproperty, fixed or movable, as he thought best, was called a man of\r\nmortmain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Italian Nobleman of the Fifteenth Century. From a\r\nPlaying-card engraved on Copper about 1460 (Cabinet des Estampes, National\r\nLibrary of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThis name was apparently chosen because the hand, \"considered the symbol\r\nof power and the instrument of donation,\" was deprived of movement,\r\nparalysed, in fact struck as by death. It was also nearly in this sense,\r\nthat men of the Church were also called men of mortmain, because they\r\nwere equally forbidden to dispose, either in life, or by will after death,\r\nof anything belonging to them.\r\n\r\nThere were two kinds of mortmain: real and personal; one concerning land,\r\nand the other concerning the person; that is to say, land held in mortmain\r\ndid not change quality, whatever might be the position of the person who\r\noccupied it, and a \"man of mortmain\" did not cease to suffer the\r\ninconveniences of his position on whatever land he went to establish\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe mortmains were generally subject to the greater share of feudal\r\nobligations formerly imposed on serfs; these were particularly to work for\r\na certain time for their lord without receiving any wages, or else to pay\r\nhim the _tax_ when it was due, on certain definite occasions, as for\r\nexample, when he married, when he gave a dower to his daughter, when he\r\nwas taken prisoner of war, when he went to the Holy Land, &c., &c. What\r\nparticularly characterized the condition of mortmains was, that the lords\r\nhad the right to take all their goods when they died without issue, or\r\nwhen the children held a separate household; and that they could not\r\ndispose of anything they possessed, either by will or gift, beyond a\r\ncertain sum.\r\n\r\nThe noble who franchised mortmains, imposed on them in almost all cases\r\nvery heavy conditions, consisting of fees, labours, and fines of all\r\nsorts. In fact, a mortmain person, to be free, not only required to be\r\nfranchised by his own lord, but also by all the nobles on whom he was\r\ndependent, as well as by the sovereign. If a noble franchised without the\r\nconsent of his superiors, he incurred a fine, as it was considered a\r\ndismemberment or depreciation of the fief.\r\n\r\nAs early as the end of the fourteenth century, the rigorous laws of\r\nmortmain began to fall into disuse in the provinces; though if the name\r\nbegan to disappear, the condition itself continued to exist. The free men,\r\nwhether they belonged to the middle class or to the peasantry, were\r\nnevertheless still subject to pay fines or obligations to their lords of\r\nsuch a nature that they must be considered to have been practically in the\r\nsame position as mortmains. In fact, this custom had been so deeply rooted\r\ninto social habits by feudalism, that to make it disappear totally at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, it required three decrees of the National\r\nConvention (July 17 and October 2, 1793; and 8 Ventôse, year II.--that is,\r\nMarch 2, 1794).\r\n\r\nIt is only just to state, that twelve or fourteen years earlier, Louis\r\nXVI. had done all in his power towards the same purpose, by suppressing\r\nmortmain, both real or personal, on the lands of the Crown, and personal\r\nmortmain (i.e. the right of following mortmains out of their original\r\ndistricts) all over the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Alms Bag taken from some Tapestry in Orleans,\r\nFifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivileges and Rights.

The Grerman nobles, on the contrary, had\r\nnot such extended landed properties, but they appropriated all the\r\nstrongest positions. The dukes, counts, and marquises were generally of\r\nGerman origin. The Roman race, mixed with the blood of the various nations\r\nit had subdued, was the first to infuse itself into ancient Society, and\r\nonly furnished barons of a secondary order.\r\n\r\nThese heterogeneous elements, brought together, with the object of common\r\ndominion, constituted a body who found life and motion only in the\r\ntraditions of Rome and ancient Germany. From these two historical sources,\r\nas is very judiciously pointed out by M. Mary-Lafon, issued all the habits\r\nof the new society, and particularly the rights and privileges assumed by\r\nthe nobility.\r\n\r\nThese rights and privileges, which we are about to pass summarily in\r\nreview, were numerous, and often curious: amongst them may be mentioned\r\nthe rights of treasure-trove, the rights of wreck, the rights of\r\nestablishing fairs or markets, rights of marque, of sporting, &c.\r\n\r\nThe rights of treasure-trove were those which gave full power to dukes and\r\ncounts over all minerals found on their properties. It was in asserting\r\nthis right that the famous Richard Coeur de Lion, King of England, met his\r\ndeath. Adhémar, Viscount of Limoges, had discovered in a field a treasure,\r\nof which, no doubt, public report exaggerated the value, for it was said\r\nto be large enough to model in pure gold, and life-size, a Roman emperor\r\nand the members of his family, at table. Adhémar was a vassal of the Duke\r\nof Guienne, and, as a matter of course, set aside what was considered the\r\nsovereign's share in his discovery; but Richard, refusing to concede any\r\npart of his privilege, claimed the whole treasure. On the refusal of the\r\nviscount to give it up he appeared under arms before the gates of the\r\nCastle of Chalus, where he supposed that the treasure was hidden. On\r\nseeing the royal standard, the garrison offered to open the gates. \"No,\"\r\nanswered Richard, \"since you have forced me to unfurl my banner, I shall\r\nonly enter by the breach, and you shall all be hung on the battlements.\"\r\nThe siege commenced, and did not at first seem to favour the English, for\r\nthe besieged made a noble stand. One evening, as his troops were\r\nassaulting the place, in order to witness the scene, Richard was sitting\r\nat a short distance on a piece of rock, protected with a target--that is,\r\na large shield covered with leather and blades of iron--which two archers\r\nheld over him. Impatient to see the result of the assault, Richard pushed\r\ndown the shield, and that moment decided his fate (1199). An archer of\r\nChalus, who had recognised him and was watching from the top of the\r\nrampart, sent a bolt from a crossbow, which hit him full in the chest. The\r\nwound, however, would perhaps not have been mortal, but, shortly after,\r\nhaving carried the place by storm, and in his delight at finding the\r\ntreasure almost intact, he gave himself up madly to degrading orgies,\r\nduring which he had already dissipated the greater part of his treasure,\r\nand died of his wound twelve days later; first having, however, graciously\r\npardoned the bowman who caused his death.\r\n\r\nThe right of shipwrecks, which the nobles of seaboard countries rarely\r\nrenounced, and of which they were the more jealous from the fact that they\r\nhad continually to dispute them with their vassals and neighbours, was the\r\npitiless and barbaric right of appropriating the contents of ships\r\nhappening to be wrecked on their shores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 24 and 25.--Varlet or Squire carrying a Halberd with\r\na thick Blade; and Archer, in Fighting Dress, drawing the String of his\r\nCrossbow with a double-handled Winch.--From the Miniatures of the\r\n\"Jouvencel,\" and the \"Chroniques\" of Froissart, Manuscripts of the\r\nFifteenth Century (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nWhen the feudal nobles granted to their vassals the right of assembling on\r\ncertain days, in order to hold fairs and markets, they never neglected to\r\nreserve to themselves some tax on each head of cattle, as well as on the\r\nvarious articles brought in and put up for sale. As these fairs and\r\nmarkets never failed to attract a great number of buyers and sellers, this\r\nformed a very lucrative tax for the noble (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Flemish Peasants at the Cattle Market.--Miniature\r\nof the \"Chroniques de Hainaut.\" Manuscripts of the Fifteenth Century, vol.\r\nii. fol. 204 (Library of the Dukes of Burgundy, Brussels).]\r\n\r\nThe right of _marque_, or reprisal, was a most barbarous custom. A famous\r\nexample is given of it. In 1022, William the Pious, Count of Angoulême,\r\nbefore starting for a pilgrimage to Rome, made his three brothers, who\r\nwere his vassals, swear to live in honourable peace and good friendship.\r\nBut, notwithstanding their oath, two of the brothers, having invited the\r\nthird to the Easter festivities, seized him at night in his bed, put out\r\nhis eyes so that he might not find the way to his castle, and cut out his\r\ntongue so that he might not name the authors of this horrible treatment.\r\nThe voice of God, however, denounced them, and the Count of Angoulême,\r\nshuddering with horror, referred the case to his sovereign, the Duke of\r\nAquitaine, William IV., who immediately came, and by fire and sword\r\nexercised his right of _marque_ on the lands of the two brothers, leaving\r\nthem nothing but their lives and limbs, after having first put out their\r\neyes and cut out their tongues, so as to inflict on them the penalty of\r\nretaliation.\r\n\r\nThe right of sporting or hunting was of all prerogatives that dearest to,\r\nand most valued by the nobles. Not only were the severest and even\r\ncruellest penalties imposed on \"vilains\" who dared to kill the smallest\r\nhead of game, but quarrels frequently arose between nobles of different\r\ndegrees on the subject, some pretending to have a feudal privilege of\r\nhunting on the lands of others (Fig. 27). From this tyrannical exercise of\r\nthe right of hunting, which the least powerful of the nobles only\r\nsubmitted to with the most violent and bitter feelings, sprung those old\r\nand familiar ballads, which indicate the popular sentiment on the subject.\r\nIn some of these songs the inveterate hunters are condemned, by the order\r\nof Fairies or of the Fates, either to follow a phantom stag for\r\neverlasting, or to hunt, like King Artus, in the clouds and to catch a fly\r\nevery hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe right of jurisdiction, which gave judicial power to the dukes and\r\ncounts in cases arising in their domains, had no appeal save to the King\r\nhimself, and this was even often contested by the nobles, as for instance,\r\nin the unhappy case of Enguerrand de Coucy. Enguerrand had ordered three\r\nyoung Flemish noblemen, who were scholars at the Abbey of \"St. Nicholas\r\ndes Bois,\" to be seized and hung, because, not knowing that they were on\r\nthe domain of the Lord of Coucy, they had killed a few rabbits with\r\narrows. St. Louis called the case before him. Enguerrand answered to the\r\ncall, but only to dispute the King's right, and to claim the judgment of\r\nhis peers. The King, without taking any notice of the remonstrance,\r\nordered Enguerrand to be locked up in the big tower of the Louvre, and was\r\nnearly applying the law of _retaliation_ to his case. Eventually he\r\ngranted him letters of pardon, after condemning him to build three\r\nchapels, where masses were continually to be said for the three victims;\r\nto give the forest where the young scholars had been found hunting, to the\r\nAbbey of \"St. Nicholas des Bois;\" to lose on all his estates the rights of\r\njurisdiction and sporting; to serve three years in the Holy Land; and to\r\npay to the King a fine of 12,500 pounds tournois. It must be remembered\r\nthat Louis IX., although most generous in cases relating simply to private\r\ninterests, was one of the most stubborn defenders of royal prerogatives.\r\n\r\nA right which feudalists had the greatest interest in observing, and\r\ncausing to be respected, because they themselves might with their\r\nwandering habits require it at any moment, was that of _safe convoy_, or\r\n_guidance_. This right was so powerful, that it even applied itself to the\r\nlower orders, and its violation was considered the most odious crime;\r\nthus, in the thirteenth century, the King of Aragon was severely abused by\r\nall persons and all classes, because in spite of this right he caused a\r\nJew to be burned so as not to have to pay a debt which the man claimed of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Nobleman in Hunting Costume, preceded by his\r\nServant, trying to find the Scent of a Stag.--From a Miniature in the Book\r\nof Gaston Phoebus (\"Des Deduitz de la Chasse des Bestes\r\nSauvaiges\").--Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century (National Library of\r\nParis).]\r\n\r\nThe right of \"the Crown\" should also be mentioned, which consisted of a\r\ncircle of gold ornamented in various fashions, according to the different\r\ndegrees of feudal monarchy, which vassals had to present to their lord on\r\nthe day of his investiture. The right of seal was a fee or fine they had\r\nto pay for the charters which their lord caused to be delivered to them.\r\n\r\nThe duty of _aubaine_ was the fine or due paid by merchants, either in\r\nkind or money, to the feudal chief, when they passed near his castle,\r\nlanded in his ports, or exposed goods for sale in his markets.\r\n\r\nThe nobles of second order possessed among their privileges that of\r\nwearing spurs of silver or gold according to their rank of knighthood; the\r\nright of receiving double rations when prisoners of war; the right of\r\nclaiming a year's delay when a creditor wished to seize their land; and\r\nthe right of never having to submit to torture after trial, unless they\r\nwere condemned to death for the crime they had committed. If a great baron\r\nfor serious offences confiscated the goods of a noble who was his vassal,\r\nthe latter had a right to keep his palfrey, the horse of his squire,\r\nvarious pieces of his harness and armour, his bed, his silk robe, his\r\nwife's bed, one of her dresses, her ring, her cloth stomacher, &c.\r\n\r\nThe nobles alone possessed the right of having seats of honour in churches\r\nand in chapels (Fig. 28), and to erect therein funereal monuments, and we\r\nknow that they maintained this right so rigorously and with so much\r\neffrontery, that fatal quarrels at times arose on questions of precedence.\r\nThe epitaphs, the placing of tombs, the position of a monument, were all\r\nsubjects for conflicts or lawsuits. The nobles enjoyed also the right of\r\n_disinheritance_, that is to say, of claiming the goods of a person dying\r\non their lands who had no direct heir; the right of claiming a tax when a\r\nfief or domain changed hands; the right of _common oven_, or requiring\r\nvassals to make use of the mill, the oven, or the press of the lord. At\r\nthe time of the vintage, no peasant might sell his wine until the nobles\r\nhad sold theirs. Everything was a source of privilege for the nobles.\r\nKings and councils waived the necessity of their studying, in order to be\r\nreceived as bachelors of universities. If a noble was made a prisoner of\r\nwar, his life was saved by his nobility, and his ransom had practically to\r\nbe raised by the \"vilains\" of his domains. The nobles were also exempted\r\nfrom serving in the militia, nor were they obliged to lodge soldiers, &c.\r\nThey had a thousand pretexts for establishing taxes on their vassals, who\r\nwere generally considered \"taxable and to be worked at will.\" Thus in the\r\ndomain of Montignac, the Count of Perigord claimed among other things as\r\nfollows: \"for every case of censure or complaint brought before him, 10\r\ndeniers; for a quarrel in which blood was shed, 60 sols; if blood was not\r\nshed, 7 sols; for use of ovens, the sixteenth loaf of each baking; for the\r\nsale of corn in the domain, 43 setiers: besides these, 6 setiers of rye,\r\n161 setiers of oats, 3 setiers of beans, 1 pound of wax, 8 capons, 17\r\nhens, and 37 loads of wine.\" There were a multitude of other rights due to\r\nhim, including the provostship fees, the fees on deeds, the tolls and\r\nfurnaces of towns, the taxes on salt, on leather, corn, nuts; fees for the\r\nright of fishing; for the right of sporting, which last gave the lord a\r\ncertain part or quarter of the game killed, and, in addition, the _dîme_\r\nor tenth part of all the corn, wine, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Jean Jouvenel des Ursins, Provost of the\r\nMerchants of Paris, and Michelle de Vitry, his Wife, in the Reign of\r\nCharles VI.--Fragment of a Picture of the Period, which was in the Chapel\r\nof the Ursinus, and is now in the Versailles Museum.]\r\n\r\nThis worthy noble gathered in besides all this, during the religious\r\nfestivals of the year, certain tributes in money on the estate of\r\nMontignac alone, amounting to as much as 20,000 pounds tournois. One can\r\njudge by this rough sketch, of the income he must have had, both in good\r\nand bad years, from his other domains in the rich county of Perigord.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that this was an exceptional case; all over the\r\nfeudal territory the same state of things existed, and each lord farmed\r\nboth his lands and the persons whom feudal right had placed under his\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Dues on Wines, granted to the Chapter of Tournai\r\nby King Chilperic.--From the Windows of the Cathedral of Tournai,\r\nFifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nTo add to these already excessive rates and taxes, there were endless\r\ndues, under all shapes and names, claimed by the ecclesiastical lords\r\n(Figs. 29 and 30). And not only did the nobility make without scruple\r\nthese enormous exactions, but the Crown supported them in avenging any\r\nact, however opposed to all sense of justice; so that the nobles were\r\nreally placed above the great law of equality, without which the\r\ncontinuance of social order seemed normally impossible.\r\n\r\nThe history of the city of Toulouse gives us a significant example on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--The Bishop of Tournai receiving the Tithe of Beer\r\ngranted by King Chilpéric.--From the Windows of the Cathedral of Tournai,\r\nFifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nOn Easter Day, 1335, some students of the university, who had passed the\r\nnight of the anniversary of the resurrection of our Saviour in drinking,\r\nleft the table half intoxicated, and ran about the town during the hours\r\nof service, beating pans and cauldrons, and making such a noise and\r\ndisturbance, that the indignant preachers were obliged to stop in the\r\nmiddle of their discourses, and claimed the intervention of the municipal\r\nauthorities of Toulouse. One of these, the lord of Gaure, went out of\r\nchurch with five sergeants, and tried himself to arrest the most turbulent\r\nof the band. But as he was seizing him by the body, one of his comrades\r\ngave the lord a blow with a dagger, which cut off his nose, lips, and\r\npart of his chin. This occurrence aroused the whole town. Toulouse had\r\nbeen insulted in the person of its first magistrate, and claimed\r\nvengeance. The author of the deed, named Aimeri de Bérenger, was seized,\r\njudged, condemned, and beheaded, and his body was suspended on the\r\n_spikes_ of the Château Narbonnais.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Fellows of the University of Paris haranguing the\r\nEmperor Charles IV. in 1377.--From a Miniature of the Manuscript of the\r\n\"Chroniques de St. Denis,\" No. 8395 (National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nToulouse had to pay dearly for the respect shown to its municipal dignity.\r\nThe parents of the student presented a petition to the King against the\r\ncity, for having dared to execute a noble and to hang his body on a\r\ngibbet, in opposition to the sacred right which this noble had of\r\nappealing to the judgment of his peers. The Parliament of Paris finally\r\ndecided the matter with the inflexible partiality to the rights of rank,\r\nand confiscated all the goods of the inhabitants, forced the principal\r\nmagistrates to go on their knees before the house of Aimeri de Bérenger,\r\nand ask pardon; themselves to take down the body of the victim, and to\r\nhave it publicly and honourably buried in the burial-ground of the\r\nDaurade. Such was the sentence and humiliation to which one of the first\r\ntowns of the south was subjected, for having practised immediate justice\r\non a noble, whilst it would certainly have suffered no vindication, if the\r\nculprit condemned to death had belonged to the middle or lower orders.\r\n\r\nWe must nevertheless remember that heavy dues fell upon the privileged\r\nclass themselves to a certain degree, and that if they taxed their poor\r\nvassals without mercy, they had in their turn often to reckon with their\r\nsuperiors in the feudal hierarchy.\r\n\r\n_Albere_, or right of shelter, was the principal charge imposed upon the\r\nnoble. When a great baron visited his lands, his tenants were not only\r\nobliged to give him and his followers shelter, but also provisions and\r\nfood, the nature and quality of which were all arranged beforehand with\r\nthe most extraordinary minuteness. The lesser nobles took advantage\r\nsometimes of the power they possessed to repurchase this obligation; but\r\nthe rich, on the contrary, were most anxious to seize the occasion of\r\nproudly displaying before their sovereign all the pomp in their power, at\r\nthe risk even of mortgaging their revenues for several years, and of\r\nruining their vassals. History is full of stories bearing witness to the\r\nextravagant prodigalities of certain nobles on such occasions.\r\n\r\nPayments in kind fell generally on the abbeys, up to 1158. That of St.\r\nDenis, which was very rich in lands, was charged with supplying the house\r\nand table of the King. This tax, which became heavier and heavier,\r\neventually fell on the Parisians, who only succeeded in ridding themselves\r\nof it in 1374, when Charles V. made all the bourgeois of Paris noble. In\r\nthe twelfth century, all furniture made of wood or iron which was found in\r\nthe house of the Bishop at his death, became the property of the King. But\r\nin the fourteenth century, the abbots of St. Denis, St. Germain des Prés,\r\nSt. Geneviève (Fig. 32), and a few priories in the neighbourhood of Paris,\r\nwere only required to present the sovereign with two horse-loads of\r\nproduce annually, so as to keep up the old system of fines.\r\n\r\nThis system of rents and dues of all kinds was so much the basis of social\r\norganization in the Middle Ages, that it sometimes happened that the lower\r\norders benefited by it.\r\n\r\nThus the bed of the Bishop of Paris belonged, after his death, to the poor\r\ninvalids of the Hôtel Dieu. The canons were also bound to leave theirs to\r\nthat hospital, as an atonement for the sins which they had committed. The\r\nBishops of Paris were required to give two very sumptuous repasts to\r\ntheir chapters at the feasts of St. Eloi and St. Paul. The holy men of\r\nSt. Martin were obliged, annually, on the 10th of November, to offer to\r\nthe first President of the Court of Parliament, two square caps, and to\r\nthe first usher, a writing-desk and a pair of gloves. The executioner too\r\nreceived, from various monastic communities of the capital, bread,\r\nbottles of wine, and pigs' heads; and even criminals who were taken to\r\nMontfaucon to be hung had the right to claim bread and wine from the nuns\r\nof St. Catherine and the Filles Dieux, as they passed those establishments\r\non their way to the gibbet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Front of the Ancient Church of the Abbey of\r\nSainte-Geneviève, in Paris, founded by Clovis, and rebuilt from the\r\nEleventh to Thirteenth Centuries.--State of the Building before its\r\nDestruction at the End of the Last Century.]\r\n\r\nFines were levied everywhere, at all times, and for all sorts of reasons.\r\nUnder the name of _épices_, the magistrates, judges, reporters, and\r\ncounsel, who had at first only received sweetmeats and preserves as\r\nvoluntary offerings, eventually exacted substantial tribute in current\r\ncoin. Scholars who wished to take rank in the University sent some small\r\npies, costing ten sols, to each examiner. Students in philosophy or\r\ntheology gave two suppers to the president, eight to the other masters,\r\nbesides presenting them with sweetmeats, &c. It would be an endless task\r\nto relate all the fines due by apprentices and companions before they\r\ncould reach mastership in their various crafts, nor have we yet mentioned\r\ncertain fines, which, from their strange or ridiculous nature, prove to\r\nwhat a pitch of folly men may be led under the influence of tyranny,\r\nvanity, or caprice.\r\n\r\nThus, we read of vassals descending to the humiliating occupation of\r\nbeating the water of the moat of the castle, in order to stop the noise of\r\nthe frogs, during the illness of the mistress; we elsewhere find that at\r\ntimes the lord required of them to hop on one leg, to kiss the latch of\r\nthe castle-gate, or to go through some drunken play in his presence, or\r\nsing a somewhat broad song before the lady.\r\n\r\nAt Tulle, all the rustics who had married during the year were bound to\r\nappear on the Puy or Mont St. Clair. At twelve o'clock precisely, three\r\nchildren came out of the hospital, one beating a drum violently, the other\r\ntwo carrying a pot full of dirt; a herald called the names of the\r\nbride-grooms, and those who were absent or were unable to assist in\r\nbreaking the pot by throwing stones at it, paid a fine.\r\n\r\nAt Périgueux, the young couples had to give the consuls a pincushion of\r\nembossed leather or cloth of different colours; a woman marrying a second\r\ntime was required to present them with an earthen pot containing twelve\r\nsticks of different woods; a woman marrying for the third time, a barrel\r\nof cinders passed thirteen times through the sieve, and thirteen spoons\r\nmade of wood of fruit-trees; and, lastly, one coming to the altar for the\r\nfifth time was obliged to bring with her a small tub containing the\r\nexcrement of a white hen!\r\n\r\n\"The people of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period were literally\r\ntied down with taxes and dues of all sorts,\" says M. Mary-Lafon. \"If a few\r\ngleams of liberty reached them, it was only from a distance, and more in\r\nthe hope of the future than as regarded the present. As an example of the\r\nway people were treated, a certain Lord of Laguène, spoken of in the old\r\nchronicles of the south, may be mentioned. Every year, this cunning baron\r\nassembled his tenants in the village square. A large maypole was planted,\r\nand on the top was attached a wren. The lord, pointing to the little bird,\r\ndeclared solemnly, that if any 'vilain' succeeded in piercing him with an\r\narrow he should be exempt from that year's dues. The vilains shot away,\r\nbut, to the great merriment of their lord, never hit, and so had to\r\ncontinue paying the dues.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Ramparts of the Town of Aigues-Mortes, one of the\r\nMunicipalities of Languedoc.]\r\n\r\nOne can easily understand how such a system, legalised by law, hampered\r\nthe efforts for freedom, which a sense of human dignity was constantly\r\nraising in the bosoms of the oppressed. The struggle was long, often\r\nbloody, and at times it seemed almost hopeless, for on both sides it was\r\nfelt that the contest was between two principles which were incompatible,\r\nand one of which must necessarily end by annihilating the other. Any\r\ncompromise between the complete slavery and the personal freedom of the\r\nlower orders, could only be a respite to enable these implacable\r\nadversaries to reinforce themselves, so as to resume with more vigour than\r\never this desperate combat, the issue of which was so long to remain\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis IV Leaving Alexandria on the 24th of April 1507 To\r\nchastise the city of Genoa.\r\n\r\nFrom a miniature by Jean Marot. No 5091, Bibl. nat'le de Paris.]\r\n\r\nThese efforts to obtain individual liberty displayed themselves more\r\nparticularly in towns; but although they became almost universal in the\r\nwest, they had not the same importance or character everywhere. The feudal\r\nsystem had not everywhere produced the same consequences. Thus, whilst in\r\nancient Gaul it had absorbed all social vitality, we find that in Germany,\r\nthe place of its origin, the Teutonic institutions of older date gave a\r\ncomparative freedom to the labourers. In southern countries again we find\r\nthe same beneficial effect from the Roman rule.\r\n\r\nOn that long area of land reaching from the southern slope of the Cevennes\r\nto the Apennines, the hand of the barbarian had weighed much less heavily\r\nthan on the rest of Europe. In those favoured provinces where Roman\r\norganization had outlived Roman patronage, it seems as if ancient\r\nsplendour had never ceased to exist, and the elegance of customs\r\nre-flourished amidst the ruins. There, a sort of urban aristocracy always\r\ncontinued, as a balance against the nobles, and the counsel of elected\r\n_prud'hommes_, the syndics, jurors or _capitouls_, who in the towns\r\nreplaced the Roman _honorati_ and _curiales_, still were considered by\r\nkings and princes as holding some position in the state. The municipal\r\nbody, larger, more open than the old \"ward,\" no longer formed a\r\ncorporation of unwilling aristocrats enchained to privileges which ruined\r\nthem. The principal cities on the Italian coast had already amassed\r\nenormous wealth by commerce, and displayed the most remarkable ardour,\r\nactivity, and power. The Eternal City, which was disputed by emperors,\r\npopes, and barons of the Roman States, bestirred itself at times to snatch\r\nat the ancient phantom of republicanism; and this phantom was destined\r\nsoon to change into reality, and another Rome, or rather a new Carthage,\r\nthe lovely Venice, arose free and independent from the waves of the\r\nAdriatic (Fig. 34).\r\n\r\nIn Lombardy, so thickly colonised by the German conquerors, feudalism, on\r\nthe contrary, weighed heavily; but there, too, the cities were populous\r\nand energetic, and the struggle for supremacy continued for centuries in\r\nan uncompromising manner between the people and the nobles, between the\r\nGuelphs and the Ghibellines.\r\n\r\nIn the north and east of the Gallic territory, the instinct of resistance\r\ndid not exist any the less, though perhaps it was more intermittent. In\r\nfact, in these regions we find ambitious nobles forestalling the action of\r\nthe King, and in order to attach towns to themselves and their houses,\r\nsuppressing the most obnoxious of the taxes, and at the same time\r\ngranting legal guarantees. For this the Counts of Flanders became\r\ncelebrated, and the famous Héribert de Vermandois was noted for being so\r\nexacting in his demands with the great, and yet so popular with the small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--View of St. Mark's Place, Venice, Sixteenth\r\nCentury, after Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\nThe eleventh century, during which feudal power rose to its height, was\r\nalso the period when a reaction set in of the townspeople against the\r\nnobility. The spirit of the city revived with that of the bourgeois (a\r\nname derived from the Teutonic word _burg_, habitation) and infused a\r\nfeeling of opposition to the system which followed the conquest of the\r\nTeutons. \"But,\" says M. Henri Martin, \"what reappeared was not the Roman\r\nmunicipality of the Empire, stained by servitude, although surrounded with\r\nglittering pomp and gorgeous arts, but it was something coarse and almost\r\nsemi-barbarous in form, though strong and generous at core, and which, as\r\nfar as the difference of the times would allow, rather reminds us of the\r\nsmall republics which existed previous to the Roman Empire.\"\r\n\r\nTwo strong impulses, originating from two totally dissimilar centres of\r\naction, irresistibly propelled this great social revolution, with its\r\nvarious and endless aspects, affecting all central Europe, and being more\r\nor less felt in the west, the north, and the south. On one side, the Greek\r\nand Latin partiality for ancient corporations, modified by a democratic\r\nelement, and an innate feeling of opposition characteristic of barbaric\r\ntribes; and on the other, the free spirit and equality of the old Celtic\r\ntribes rising suddenly against the military hierarchy, which was the\r\noffspring of conquest. Europe was roused by the double current of ideas\r\nwhich simultaneously urged her on to a new state of civilisation, and more\r\nparticularly to a new organization of city life.\r\n\r\nItaly was naturally destined to be the country where the new trials of\r\nsocial regeneration were to be made; but she presented the greatest\r\npossible variety of customs, laws, and governments, including Emperor,\r\nPope, bishops, and feudal princes. In Tuscany and Liguria, the march\r\ntowards liberty was continued almost without effort; whilst in Lombardy,\r\non the contrary, the feudal resistance was very powerful. Everywhere,\r\nhowever, cities became more or less completely enfranchised, though some\r\nmore rapidly than others. In Sicily, feudalism swayed over the countries;\r\nbut in the greater part of the peninsula, the democratic spirit of the\r\ncities influenced the enfranchisement of the rural population. The feudal\r\ncaste was in fact dissolved; the barons were transformed into patricians\r\nof the noble towns which gave their republican magistrates the old title\r\nof consuls. The Teutonic Emperor in vain sought to seize and turn to his\r\nown interest the sovereignty of the people, who had shaken off the yokes\r\nof his vassals: the signal of war was immediately given by the newly\r\nenfranchised masses; and the imperial eagle was obliged to fly before the\r\nbanners of the besieged cities. Happy indeed might the cities of Italy\r\nhave been had they not forgotten, in their prosperity, that union alone\r\ncould give them the possibility of maintaining that liberty which they so\r\nfreely risked in continual quarrels amongst one another!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--William, Duke of Normandy, accompanied by\r\nEustatius, Count of Boulogne, and followed by his Knights in\r\narms.--Military Dress of the Eleventh Century, from Bayeux Tapestry said\r\nto have been worked by Queen Matilda.]\r\n\r\nThe Italian movement was immediately felt on the other side of the Alps.\r\nIn Provence, Septimanie, and Aquitaine, we find, in the eleventh century,\r\ncities which enjoyed considerable freedom. Under the name of communities\r\nand universities, which meant that all citizens were part of the one body,\r\nthey jointly interfered in the general affairs of the kingdom to which\r\nthey belonged. Their magistrates were treated on a footing of equality\r\nwith the feudal nobility, and although the latter at first would only\r\nrecognise them as \"good men\" or notables, the consuls knew how to make a\r\nposition for themselves in the hierarchy. If the consulate, which was a\r\npowerful expression of the most prominent system of independence, did no\r\nsucceed in suppressing feudalism in Provence as in Italy, it at least so\r\ntransformed it, that it deprived it of its most unjust and insupportable\r\nelements. At Toulouse, for instance (where the consuls were by exception\r\ncalled _capitouls_, that is to say, heads of the chapters or councils of\r\nthe city), the lord of the country seemed less a feudal prince in his\r\ncapital, than an honorary magistrate of the bourgeoisie. Avignon added to\r\nher consuls two _podestats_ (from the Latin _potestas_, power). At\r\nMarseilles, the University of the high city was ruled by a republic under\r\nthe presidency of the Count of Provence, although the lower city was still\r\nunder the sovereignty of a viscount. Périgueux, which was divided into two\r\ncommunities, \"the great and the small fraternity,\" took up arms to resist\r\nthe authority of the Counts of Périgord; and Arles under its _podestats_\r\nwas governed for some time as a free and imperial town. Amongst the\r\nconstitutions which were established by the cities, from the eleventh to\r\nthe sixteenth centuries, we find admirable examples of administration and\r\ngovernment, so that one is struck with admiration at the efforts of\r\nintelligence and patriotism, often uselessly lavished on such small\r\npolitical arenas. The consulate, which nominally at least found its origin\r\nin the ancient grandeur of southern regions, did not spread itself beyond\r\nLyons. In the centre of France, at Poictiers, Tours, Moulin, &c., the\r\nurban progress only manifested itself in efforts which were feeble and\r\neasily suppressed; but in the north, on the contrary, in the provinces\r\nbetween the Seine and the Rhine, and even between the Seine and the Loire,\r\nthe system of franchise took footing and became recognised. In some\r\nplaces, the revolution was effected without difficulty, but in others it\r\ngave rise to the most determined struggles. In Normandy, for instance,\r\nunder the active and intelligent government of the dukes of the race of\r\nRoll or Rollon, the middle class was rich and even warlike. It had access\r\nto the councils of the duchy; and when it was contemplated to invade\r\nEngland, the Duke William (Fig. 35) found support from the middle class,\r\nboth in money and men. The case was the same in Flanders, where the towns\r\nof Ghent (Fig. 36), of Bruges, of Ypres, after being enfranchised but a\r\nshort time developed with great rapidity. But in the other counties of\r\nwestern France, the greater part of the towns were still much oppressed by\r\nthe counts and bishops. If some obtained certain franchises, these\r\nprivileges were their ultimate ruin, owing to the ill faith of their\r\nnobles. A town between the Loire and the Seine gave the signal which\r\ncaused the regeneration of the North. The inhabitants of Mans formed a\r\ncommunity or association, and took an oath that they would obtain and\r\nmaintain certain rights. They rebelled about 1070, and forced the count\r\nand his noble vassals to grant them the freedom which they had sworn to\r\nobtain, though William of Normandy very soon restored the rebel city to\r\norder, and dissolved the presumptuous community. However, the example soon\r\nbore fruit. Cambrai rose in its turn and proclaimed the \"Commune,\" and\r\nalthough its bishop, aided by treason and by the Count of Hainault,\r\nreduced it to obedience, it only seemed to succumb for a time, to renew\r\nthe struggle with greater success at a subsequent period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Civic Guard of Ghent (Brotherhood of St.\r\nSebastian), from a painting on the Wall of the Chapel of St. John and St.\r\nPaul, Ghent, near the Gate of Bruges.]\r\n\r\nWe have just mentioned the Commune; but we must not mistake the true\r\nmeaning of this word, which, under a Latin form (_communitas_), expresses\r\noriginally a Germanic idea, and in its new form a Christian mode of\r\nliving. Societies of mutual defence, guilds, &c., had never disappeared\r\nfrom Germanic and Celtic countries; and, indeed, knighthood itself was\r\nbut a brotherhood of Christian warriors. The societies of the _Paix de\r\nDieu_, and of the _Trève de Dieu_, were encouraged by the clergy in order\r\nto stop the bloody quarrels of the nobility, and formed in reality great\r\nreligious guilds. This idea of a body of persons taking some common oath\r\nto one another, of which feudalism gave so striking an example, could not\r\nfail to influence the minds of the rustics and the lower classes, and they\r\nonly wanted the opportunity which the idea of the Commune at once gave\r\nthem of imitating their superiors.\r\n\r\nThey too took oaths, and possessed their bodies and souls in \"common;\"\r\nthey seized, by force of strategy, the ramparts of their towns; they\r\nelected mayors, aldermen, and jurors, who were charged to watch over the\r\ninterests of their association. They swore to spare neither their goods,\r\ntheir labour, nor their blood, in order to free themselves; and not\r\ncontent with defending themselves behind barricades or chains which closed\r\nthe streets, they boldly took the offensive against the proud feudal\r\nchiefs before whom their fathers had trembled, and they forced the nobles,\r\nwho now saw themselves threatened by this armed multitude, to acknowledge\r\ntheir franchise by a solemn covenant.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that everywhere the Commune was established by means of\r\ninsurrection, for it was obtained after all sorts of struggles; and\r\nfranchises were sold in some places for gold, and in others granted by a\r\nmore or less voluntary liberality. Everywhere the object was the same;\r\neverywhere they struggled or negotiated to upset, by a written\r\nconstitution or charter, the violence and arbitrary rule under which they\r\nhad so long suffered, and to replace by an annual and fixed rent, under\r\nthe protection of an independent and impartial law, the unlimited\r\nexactions and disguised plundering so long made by the nobility and\r\nroyalty. Circumstanced as they were, what other means had they to attain\r\nthis end but ramparts and gates, a common treasury, a permanent military\r\nforce, and magistrates who were both administrators, judges, and captains?\r\nThe hôtel de ville, or mansion-house, immediately became a sort of civic\r\ntemple, where the banner of the Commune, the emblems of unity, and the\r\nseal which sanctioned the municipal acts were preserved. Then arose the\r\nwatch-towers, where the watchmen were unceasingly posted night and day,\r\nand whence the alarm signal was ever ready to issue its powerful sounds\r\nwhen danger threatened the city. These watch-towers, the monuments of\r\nliberty, became as necessary for the burghers as the clock-towers of\r\ntheir cathedrals, whose brilliant peals and joyous chimes gave zest to the\r\npopular feasts (Fig. 37). The mansion-houses built in Flanders from the\r\nfourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, under municipal influence, are\r\nmarvels of architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Chimes of the Clock of St. Lambert of Liége.]\r\n\r\nWho is there who could thoroughly describe or even appreciate all the\r\nhappy or unhappy vicissitudes relating to the establishment of the\r\nCommunes? We read of the Commune of Cambrai, four times created, four\r\ntimes destroyed, and which was continually at war with the Bishops; the\r\nCommune of Beauvais, sustained on the contrary by the diocesan prelate\r\nagainst two nobles who possessed feudal rights over it; Laon, a commune\r\nbought for money from the bishop, afterwards confirmed by the King, and\r\nthen violated by fraud and treachery, and eventually buried in the blood\r\nof its defenders. We read also of St. Quentin, where the Count of\r\nVermandois and his vassals voluntarily swore to maintain the right of the\r\nbourgeois, and scrupulously respected their oath. In many other localities\r\nthe feudal dignitaries took alarm simply at the name of Commune, and\r\nwhereas they would not agree to the very best arrangements under this\r\nterrible designation, they did not hesitate to adopt them when called\r\neither the \"laws of friendship,\" the \"peace of God,\" or the \"institutions\r\nof peace.\" At Lisle, for instance, the bourgeois magistrates took the name\r\nof _appeasers_, or watchers over friendship. At Aire, in Artois, the\r\nmembers of friendship mutually, not only helped one another against the\r\nenemy, but also assisted one another in distress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--The Deputies of the burghers of Ghent, in revolt\r\nagainst their Sovereign Louis II., Count of Flanders, come to beg him to\r\npardon them, and to return to their Town. 1397--Miniature from Froissart,\r\nNo. 2644 (National Library of Paris)]\r\n\r\nAmiens deserves the first place amongst the cities which dearly purchased\r\ntheir privileges. The most terrible and sanguinary war was sustained by\r\nthe bourgeois against their count and lord of the manor, assisted by King\r\nLouis le Gros, who had under similar circumstances just taken the part of\r\nthe nobles of Laon.\r\n\r\nFrom Amiens, which, having been triumphant, became a perfect municipal\r\nrepublic, the example propagated itself throughout the rest of Picardy,\r\nthe Isle of France, Normandy, Brittany, and Burgundy, and by degrees,\r\nwithout any revolutionary shocks, reached the region of Lyons, where the\r\nconsulate, a characteristic institution of southern Communes, ended.\r\n\r\nFrom Flanders, also, the movement spread in the direction of the German\r\nEmpire; and there, too, the struggle was animated, and victorious against\r\nthe aristocracy, until at last the great system of enfranchisement\r\nprevailed; and the cities of the west and south formed a confederation\r\nagainst the nobles, whilst those in the north formed the famous Teutonic\r\nHanse, so celebrated for its maritime commerce.\r\n\r\nThe centre of France slowly followed the movement; but its progress was\r\nconsiderably delayed by the close influence of royalty, which sometimes\r\nconceded large franchises, and sometimes suppressed the least claims to\r\nindependence. The kings, who willingly favoured Communes on the properties\r\nof their neighbours, did not so much care to see them forming on their own\r\nestates; unless the exceptional position and importance of any town\r\nrequired a wise exercise of tolerance. Thus Orleans, situated in the heart\r\nof the royal domains, was roughly repulsed in its first movement; whilst\r\nMantes, which was on the frontier of the Duchy of Normandy, and still\r\nunder the King of England, had but to ask in order to receive its\r\nfranchise from the King of France.\r\n\r\nIt was particularly in the royal domains that cities were to be found,\r\nwhich, although they did not possess the complete independence of\r\ncommunes, had a certain amount of liberty and civil guarantees. They had\r\nneither the right of war, the watch-tower, nor the exclusive jurisdiction\r\nover their elected magistrates, for the bailiffs and the royal provosts\r\nrepresented the sovereign amongst them (Fig. 39).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Bailliage, or Tribunal of the King's\r\nBailiff.--Fac-simile of an Engraving on Wood in the Work of Josse\r\nDamhoudere, \"Praxis Rerum Civilium.\" (Antwerp, 1557, in 4to.).]\r\n\r\nIn Paris, less than anywhere, could the kings consent to the organization\r\nof an independent political System, although that city succeeded in\r\ncreating for itself a municipal existence. The middle-class influence\r\noriginated in a Gallo-Roman corporation. The Company of _Nautes_ or \"the\r\nCorporation of the Water Trade,\" formed a centre round which were\r\nsuccessively attached various bodies of different trades. Gradually a\r\nstrong concourse of civic powers was established, which succeeded in\r\nelecting a municipal council, composed of a provost of merchants, four\r\naldermen, and twenty-six councillors of the town. This council afterwards\r\nsucceeded in overstepping the royal influence at difficult times, and was\r\ndestined to play a prominent part in history.\r\n\r\nThere also sprang up a lower order of towns or boroughs than these\r\nbourgeois cities, which were especially under the Crown. Not having\r\nsufficient strength to claim a great amount of liberty, they were obliged\r\nto be satisfied with a few privileges, conceded to them by the nobles, for\r\nthe most part with a political end. These were the Free Towns or New Towns\r\nwhich we have already named.\r\n\r\nHowever it came about, it is certain that although during the tenth\r\ncentury feudal power was almost supreme in Europe, as early as the twelfth\r\ncentury the municipal system had gained great weight, and was constantly\r\nprogressing until the policy of the kingdom became developed on a more and\r\nmore extended basis, so that it was then necessary for it to give up its\r\nprimitive nature, and to participate in the great movement of\r\nconsolidisation and national unity. In this way the position of the large\r\ntowns in the state relatively lost their individual position, and became\r\nsomewhat analogous, as compared with the kingdom at large, to that\r\nformerly held by bourgeois in the cities. Friendly ties arose between\r\nprovinces; and distinct and rival interests were effaced by the general\r\naspiration towards common objects. The towns were admitted to the states\r\ngeneral, and the citizens of various regions mixed as representatives of\r\nthe _Tiers Etat_. Three orders thus met, who were destined to struggle for\r\npredominance in the future.\r\n\r\nWe must call attention to the fact that, as M. Henri Martin says, by an\r\napparent contradiction, the fall of the Communes declared itself in\r\ninverse ratio to the progress of the _Tiers Etat_. By degrees, as the\r\ngovernment became more settled from the great fiefs being absorbed by the\r\nCrown, and as parliament and other courts of appeal which emanated from\r\nthe middle class extended their high judiciary and military authority, so\r\nthe central power, organized under monarchical form, must necessarily have\r\nbeen less disposed to tolerate the local independence of the Communes. The\r\nState replaced the Commune for everything concerning justice, war, and\r\nadministration. No doubt some valuable privileges were lost; but that was\r\nonly an accidental circumstance, for a great social revolution was\r\nproduced, which cleared off at once all the relics of the old age; and\r\nwhen the work of reconstruction terminated, homage was rendered to the\r\nvenerable name of \"Commune,\" which became uniformly applied to all towns,\r\nboroughs, or villages into which the new spirit of the same municipal\r\nsystem was infused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Various Arms of the Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Life in the Castles, the Towns, and the Rural Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Merovingian Castles.--Pastimes of the Nobles; Hunting,\r\n  War.--Domestic Arrangements.--Private Life of Charlemagne.--Domestic\r\n  Habits under the Carlovingians.--Influence of Chivalry.--Simplicity of\r\n  the Court of Philip Angustus not imitated by his Successors.--Princely\r\n  Life of the Fifteenth Century.--The bringing up of Latour Landry, a\r\n  Noble of Anjou.--Varlets, Pages, Esquires, Maids of Honour.--Opulence of\r\n  the Bourgeoisie.--\"Le Menagier de Paris.\"--Ancient Dwellings.--State of\r\n  Rustics at various Periods.--\"Rustic Sayings,\" by Noël du Fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugustin Thierry, taking Gregory of Tours, the Merovingian Herodotus, as\r\nan authority, thus describes a royal domain under the first royal dynasty\r\nof France:--\r\n\r\n\"This dwelling in no way possessed the military aspect of the château of\r\nthe Middle Ages; it was a large building surrounded with porticos of Roman\r\narchitecture, sometimes built of carefully polished and sculptured wood,\r\nwhich in no way was wanting in elegance. Around the main body of the\r\nbuilding were arranged the dwellings of the officers of the palace, either\r\nforeigners or Romans, and those of the chiefs of companies, who, according\r\nto Germanic custom, had placed themselves and their warriors under the\r\nKing, that is to say, under a special engagement of vassalage and\r\nfidelity. Other houses, of less imposing appearance, were occupied by a\r\ngreat number of families, who worked at all sorts of trades, such as\r\njewellery, the making of arms, weaving, currying, the embroidering of silk\r\nand gold, cotton, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Farm-buildings, paddocks, cow-houses, sheepfolds, barns, the houses of\r\nagriculturists, and the cabins of the serfs, completed the royal village,\r\nwhich perfectly resembled, although on a larger scale, the villages of\r\nancient Germany. There was something too in the position of these\r\ndwellings which resembled the scenery beyond the Rhine; the greater number\r\nof them were on the borders, and some few in the centre of great forests,\r\nwhich have since been partly destroyed, and the remains of which we so\r\nmuch admire.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--St. Remy, Bishop of Rheims, begging of Clovis the\r\nrestitution of the Sacred Vase taken by the Franks in the Pillage of\r\nSoissons.--Costumes of the Court of Burgundy in the Fifteenth\r\nCentury.--Fac-simile of a Miniature on a Manuscript of the \"History of the\r\nEmperors\" (Library of the Arsenal).]\r\n\r\nAlthough historical documents are not very explicit respecting those\r\nremote times, it is only sufficient to study carefully a very small\r\nportion of the territory in order to form some idea of the manners and\r\ncustoms of the Franks; for in the royal domain we find the existence of\r\nall classes, from the sovereign himself down to the humblest slave. As\r\nregards the private life, however, of the different classes in this\r\nelementary form of society, we have but approximate and very imperfect\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that as early as the beginning of the Merovingian\r\nrace, there was much more luxury and comfort among the upper classes than\r\nis generally supposed. All the gold and silver furniture, all the jewels,\r\nand all the rich stuffs which the Gallo-Romans had amassed in their\r\nsumptuous dwellings, had not been destroyed by the barbarians. The Frank\r\nKings had appropriated the greater part; and the rest had fallen into the\r\nhands of the chiefs of companies in the division of spoil. A well-known\r\nanecdote, namely, that concerning the Vase of Soissons (Fig. 41), which\r\nKing Clovis wished to preserve, and which a soldier broke with an axe,\r\nproves that many gems of ancient art must have disappeared, owing to the\r\nignorance and brutality of the conquerors; although it is equally certain\r\nthat the latter soon adopted the tastes and customs of the native\r\npopulation. At first, they appropriated everything that flattered their\r\npride and sensuality. This is how the material remains of the civilisation\r\nof the Gauls were preserved in the royal and noble residences, the\r\nchurches, and the monasteries. Gregory of Tours informs us, that when\r\nFrédégonde, wife of Chilpéric, gave the hand of her daughter Rigouthe to\r\nthe son of the Gothic king, fifty chariots were required to carry away all\r\nthe valuable objects which composed the princess's dower. A strange family\r\nscene, related by the same historian, gives us an idea of the private\r\nhabits of the court of that terrible queen of the Franks. \"The mother and\r\ndaughter had frequent quarrels, which sometimes ended in the most violent\r\nencounters. Frédégonde said one day to Rigouthe, 'Why do you continually\r\ntrouble me? Here are the goods of your father, take them and do as you\r\nlike with them.' And conducting her to a room where she locked up her\r\ntreasures, she opened a large box filled with valuables. After having\r\npulled out a great number of jewels which she gave to her daughter, she\r\nsaid, 'I am tired; put your own hands in the box, and take what you find.'\r\nRigouthe bent down to reach the objects placed at the bottom of the box;\r\nupon which Frédégonde immediately lowered the lid on her daughter, and\r\npressed upon it with so much force that the eyes began to start out of the\r\nprincess's head. A maid began screaming, 'Help! my mistress is being\r\nmurdered by her mother!' and Rigouthe was saved from an untimely end.\" It\r\nis further related that this was only one of the minor crimes attributed\r\nby history to Frédégonde _the Terrible_, who always carried a dagger or\r\npoison about with her.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Franks, as amongst all barbaric populations, hunting was the\r\npastime preferred when war was not being waged. The Merovingian nobles\r\nwere therefore determined hunters, and it frequently happened that hunting\r\noccupied whole weeks, and took them far from their homes and families. But\r\nwhen the season or other circumstances prevented them from waging war\r\nagainst men or beasts, they only cared for feasting and gambling. To these\r\noccupations they gave themselves up, with a determination and wildness\r\nwell worthy of those semi-civilised times. It was the custom for invited\r\nguests to appear armed at the feasts, which were the more frequent,\r\ninasmuch as they were necessarily accompanied with religious ceremonies.\r\nIt often happened that these long repasts, followed by games of chance,\r\nwere stained with blood, either in private quarrels or in a general\r\n_mêlée_. One can easily imagine the tumult which must have arisen in a\r\nnumerous assembly when the hot wine and other fermented drinks, such as\r\nbeer, &c., had excited every one to the highest pitch of unchecked\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Costumes of the Women of the Court from the Sixth\r\nto the Tenth Centuries, from Documents collected by H. de Vielcastel, in\r\nthe great Libraries of Europe.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Merovingian kings listened to the advice of the ministers of\r\nthe Catholic religion, and tried to reform these noisy excesses, and\r\nthemselves abandoned the evil custom. For this purpose they received at\r\ntheir tables bishops, who blessed the assembly at the commencement of the\r\nmeal, and were charged besides to recite chapters of holy writ, or to\r\nsing hymns out of the divine service, so as to edify and occupy the minds\r\nof the guests.\r\n\r\nGregory of Tours bears witness to the happy influence of the presence of\r\nbishops at the tables of the Frank kings and nobles; he relates, too, that\r\nChilpéric, who was very proud of his theological and secular knowledge,\r\nliked, when dining, to discuss, or rather to pronounce authoritatively his\r\nopinion on questions of grammar, before his companions in arms, who, for\r\nthe most part, neither knew how to read nor write; he even went as far as\r\nto order three ancient Greek letters to be added to the Latin alphabet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Queen Frédégonde, seated on her Throne, gives\r\norders to two young Men of Térouanne to assassinate Sigebert, King of\r\nAustrasia.--Window in the Cathedral of Tournai, Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe private properties of the Frank kings were immense, and produced\r\nenormous revenues. These monarchs had palaces in almost all the large\r\ntowns; at Bourges, Châlons-sur-Saône, Châlons-sur-Marne, Dijon, Étampes,\r\nMetz, Langres, Mayence, Rheims, Soissons, Tours, Toulouse, Trèves,\r\nValenciennes, Worms, &c. In Paris, they occupied the vast residence now\r\nknown as the _Thermes de Julien_ (Hôtel de Cluny), which then extended\r\nfrom the hill of St. Geneviève as far as the Seine; but they frequently\r\nleft it for their numerous villas in the neighbourhood, on which occasions\r\nthey were always accompanied by their treasury.\r\n\r\nAll these residences were built on the same plan. High walls surrounded\r\nthe palace. The Roman _atrium_, preserved under the name of _proaulium_\r\n(_preau_, ante-court), was placed in front of the _salutorium_ (hall of\r\nreception), where visitors were received. The _consistorium_, or great\r\ncircular hall surrounded with seats, served for legislation, councils,\r\npublic assemblies, and other solemnities, at which the kings displayed\r\ntheir royal pomp.\r\n\r\nThe _trichorium_, or dining-room, was generally the largest hall in the\r\npalace; two rows of columns divided it into three parts; one for the royal\r\nfamily, one for the officers of the household, and the third for the\r\nguests, who were always very numerous. No person of rank visiting the King\r\ncould leave without sitting at his table, or at least draining a cup to\r\nhis health. The King's hospitality was magnificent, especially on great\r\nreligious festivals such as Christmas and Easter.\r\n\r\nThe royal apartments were divided into winter and summer rooms. In order\r\nto regulate the temperature hot or cold water was used, according to the\r\nseason; this circulated in the pipes of the _hypocauste_, or the\r\nsubterranean furnace which warmed the baths. The rooms with chimneys were\r\ncalled _epicaustoria_ (stoves), and it was the custom hermetically to\r\nclose these when any one wished to be anointed with ointments and aromatic\r\nessences. In the same manner as the Gallo-Roman houses, the palaces of the\r\nFrank kings and principal nobles of ecclesiastical or military order had\r\n_thermes_, or bath-rooms: to the _thermes_ were attached a _colymbum_, or\r\nwashhouse, a gymnasium for bodily exercise, and a _hypodrome_, or covered\r\ngallery for exercise, which must not be confounded with the _hippodrome_,\r\na circus where horse-races took place.\r\n\r\nSometimes after the repast, in the interval between two games of dice, the\r\nnobles listened to a bard, who sang the brilliant deeds of their ancestors\r\nin their native tongue.\r\n\r\nUnder the government of Charlemagne, the private life of his subjects\r\nseems to have been less rough and coarse, although they did not entirely\r\ngive up their turbulent pleasures. Science and letters, for a long time\r\nburied in monasteries, reappeared like beautiful exiles at the imperial\r\ncourt, and social life thereby gained a little charm and softness.\r\nCharlemagne had created in his palace, under the direction of Alcuin, a\r\nsort of academy called the \"School of the Palace,\" which followed him\r\neverywhere. The intellectual exercises of this school generally brought\r\ntogether all the members of the imperial family, as well as all the\r\npersons of the household. Charlemagne, in fact, was himself one of the\r\nmost attentive followers of the lessons given by Alcuin. He was indeed the\r\nprincipal interlocutor and discourser at the discussions, which were on\r\nall subjects, religions, literary, and philosophical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Costumes of the Nobility from the Seventh to the\r\nNinth Centuries, from Documents gathered by H. de Vielcastel from the\r\ngreat Libraries of Europe.]\r\n\r\nCharlemagne took as much pains with the administration of his palace as he\r\ndid with that of his States. In his \"Capitulaires,\" a work he wrote on\r\nlegislature, we find him descending to the minutest details in that\r\nrespect. For instance, he not only interested himself in his warlike and\r\nhunting equipages, but also in his kitchen and pleasure gardens. He\r\ninsisted upon knowing every year the number of his oxen, horses, and\r\ngoats; he calculated the produce of the sale of fruits gathered in his\r\norchards, which were not required for the use of his house; he had a\r\nreturn of the number of fish caught in his ponds; he pointed out the\r\nshrubs best calculated for ornamenting his garden, and the vegetables\r\nwhich were required for his table, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor generally assumed the greatest simplicity in his dress. His\r\ndaily attire consisted of a linen shirt and drawers, and a woollen tunic\r\nfastened with a silk belt. Over this tunic he threw a cloak of blue stuff,\r\nvery long behind and before, but very short on each side, thus giving\r\nfreedom to his arms to use his sword, which he always wore. On his feet he\r\nwore bands of stuffs of various colours, crossed over one another, and\r\ncovering his legs also. In winter, when he travelled or hunted on\r\nhorseback, he threw over his shoulders a covering of otter or sheepskin.\r\nThe changes in fashion which the custom of the times necessitated, but to\r\nwhich he would never submit personally, induced him to issue several\r\nstrenuous orders, which, however, in reality had hardly any effect.\r\n\r\nHe was most simple as regards his food and drink, and made a habit of\r\nhaving pious or historical works read to him during his repasts. He\r\ndevoted the morning, which with him began in summer at sunrise, and in\r\nwinter earlier, to the political administration of his empire. He dined at\r\ntwelve with his family; the dukes and chiefs of various nations first\r\nwaited on him, and then took their places at the table, and were waited on\r\nin their turn by the counts, prefects, and superior officers of the court,\r\nwho dined after them. When these had finished the different chiefs of the\r\nhousehold sat down, and they were succeeded lastly by servants of the\r\nlower order, who often did not dine till midnight, and had to content\r\nthemselves with what was left. When occasion required, however, this\r\npowerful Emperor knew how to maintain the pomp and dignity of his station;\r\nbut as soon as he had done what was necessary, either for some great\r\nreligious festival or otherwise, he returned, as if by instinct, to his\r\ndear and native simplicity.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the simple tastes of Charlemagne were not\r\nalways shared by the princes and princesses of his family, nor by the\r\nmagnates of his court (Fig. 45). Poets and historians have handed down to\r\nus descriptions of hunts, feasts, and ceremonies, at which a truly Asiatic\r\nsplendour was displayed. Eginhard, however, assures us that the sons and\r\ndaughters of the King were brought up under their father's eye in liberal\r\nstudios; that, to save them from the vice of idleness, Charlemagne\r\nrequired his sons to devote themselves to all bodily exercises, such as\r\nhorsemanship, handling of arms, &c., and his daughters to do needlework\r\nand to spin. From what is recorded, however, of the frivolous habits and\r\nirregular morals of these princesses, it is evident that they but\r\nimperfectly realised the end of their education.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Costumes of the Ladies of the Nobility in the\r\nNinth Century, from a Miniature in the Bible of Charles the Bold (National\r\nLibrary of Paris).]\r\n\r\nScience and letters, which for a time were brought into prominence by\r\nCharlemagne and also by his son Louis, who was very learned and was\r\nconsidered skilful in translating and expounding Scripture, were, however,\r\nafter the death of these two kings, for a long time banished to the\r\nseclusion of the cloisters, owing to the hostile rivalry of their\r\nsuccessors, which favoured the attacks of the Norman pirates. All the\r\nmonuments and relics of the Gallo-Roman civilisation, which the great\r\nEmperor had collected, disappeared in the civil wars, or were gradually\r\ndestroyed by the devastations of the northerners.\r\n\r\nThe vast empire which Charlemagne had formed became gradually split up, so\r\nthat from a dread of social destruction, in order to protect churches and\r\nmonasteries, as well as castles and homesteads, from the attacks of\r\ninternal as well as foreign enemies, towers and impregnable fortresses\r\nbegan to rise in all parts of Europe, and particularly in France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Towers of the Castle of Sémur, and of the Castle\r\nof Nogent-le-Rotrou (Present Condition).--Specimens of Towers of the\r\nThirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first period of feudalism, that is to say from the middle of\r\nthe ninth to the middle of the twelfth centuries, the inhabitants of\r\ncastles had little time to devote to the pleasures of private life. They\r\nhad not only to be continually under arms for the endless quarrels of the\r\nKing and the great chiefs; but they had also to oppose the Normans on one\r\nside, and the Saracens on the other, who, being masters of the Spanish\r\npeninsula, spread like the rising tide in the southern counties of\r\nLanguedoc and Provence. It is true that the Carlovingian warriors obtained\r\na handsome and rich reward for these long and sanguinary efforts, for at\r\nlast they seized upon the provinces and districts which had been\r\noriginally entrusted to their charge, and the origin of their feudal\r\npossession was soon so far forgotten, that their descendants pretended\r\nthat they held the lands, which they had really usurped regardless of\r\ntheir oath, from heaven and their swords. It is needless to say, that at\r\nthat time the domestic life in these castles must have been dull and\r\nmonotonous; although, according to M. Guizot, the loneliness which was the\r\nresuit of this rough and laborious life, became by degrees the pioneer of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\"When the owner of the fief left his castle, his wife remained there,\r\nthough in a totally different position from that which women generally\r\nheld. She remained as mistress, representing her husband, and was charged\r\nwith the defence and honour of the fief. This high and exalted position,\r\nin the centre of domestic life, often gave to women an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying dignity, courage, virtue, and intelligence, which would\r\notherwise have remained hidden, and, no doubt, contributed greatly to\r\ntheir moral development, and to the general improvement of their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Woman under the Safeguard of Knighthood,\r\nallegorical Scene.--Costume of the End of the Fifteenth Century, from a\r\nMiniature in a Latin Psalm Book (Manuscript No. 175, National Library of\r\nParis).]\r\n\r\n\"The importance of children, and particularly of the eldest son, was\r\ngreater in feudal houses than elsewhere.... The eldest son of the noble\r\nwas, in the eyes of his father and of all his followers, a prince and\r\nheir-presumptive, and the hope and glory of the dynasty. These feelings,\r\nand the domestic pride and affection of the various members one to\r\nanother, united to give families much energy and power..... Add to this\r\nthe influence of Christian ideas, and it will be understood how this\r\nlonely, dull, and hard castle life was, nevertheless, favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of domestic society, and to that improvement in the condition\r\nof women which plays such a great part in the history of our\r\ncivilisation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Court of Love in Provence in the Fourteenth\r\nCentury (Manuscript of the National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nWhatever opinion may be formed of chivalry, it is impossible to deny the\r\ninfluence which this institution exercised on private life in the Middle\r\nAges. It considerably modified custom, by bringing the stronger sex to\r\nrespect and defend the weaker. These warriors, who were both simple and\r\nexternally rough and coarse, required association and intercourse with\r\nwomen to soften them (Fig. 47). In taking women and helpless widows under\r\ntheir protection, they were necessarily more and more thrown in contact\r\nwith them. A deep feeling of veneration for woman, inspired by\r\nChristianity, and, above all, by the worship of the Virgin Mary, ran\r\nthroughout the songs of the troubadours, and produced a sort of\r\nsentimental reverence for the gentle sex, which culminated in the\r\nauthority which women had in the courts of love (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the reign of Philip Augustus, that is to say, the end\r\nof the twelfth century. This epoch is remarkable, not only for its\r\npolitical history, but also for its effect on civilisation. Christianity\r\nhad then considerably influenced the world; arts, sciences, and letters,\r\nanimated by its influence, again began to appear, and to add charms to the\r\nleisure of private life. The castles were naturally the first to be\r\naffected by this poetical and intellectual regeneration, although it has\r\nbeen too much the custom to exaggerate the ignorance of those who\r\ninhabited them. We are too apt to consider the warriors of the Middle Ages\r\nas totally devoid of knowledge, and as hardly able to sign their names, as\r\nfar as the kings and princes are concerned. This is quite an error; for\r\nmany of the knights composed poems which exhibit evidence of their high\r\nliterary culture.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the epoch of troubadours, who might be called\r\nprofessional poets and actors, who went from country to country, and from\r\ncastle to castle, relating stories of good King Artus of Brittany and of\r\nthe Knights of the Round Table; repeating historical poems of the great\r\nEmperor Charlemagne and his followers. These minstrels were always\r\naccompanied by jugglers and instrumentalists, who formed a travelling\r\ntroop (Fig. 49), having no other mission than to amuse and instruct their\r\nfeudal hosts. After singing a few fragments of epics, or after the lively\r\nrecital of some ancient fable, the jugglers would display their art or\r\nskill in gymnastic feats or conjuring, which were the more appreciated by\r\nthe spectators, in that the latter were more or less able to compete with\r\nthem. These wandering troops acted small comedies, taken from incidents of\r\nthe times. Sometimes, too, the instrumentalists formed an orchestra, and\r\ndancing commenced. It may be here remarked that dancing at this epoch\r\nconsisted of a number of persons forming large circles, and turning to the\r\ntime of the music or the rhythm of the song. At least the dances of the\r\nnobles are thus represented in the MSS. of the Middle Ages. To these\r\namusements were added games of calculation and chance, the fashion for\r\nwhich had much increased, and particularly such games as backgammon,\r\ndraughts, and chess, to which certain knights devoted all their leisure.\r\n\r\nFrom the reign of Philip Augustus, a remarkable change seems to have taken\r\nplace in the private life of kings, princes, and nobles. Although his\r\ndomains and revenues had always been on the increase, this monarch never\r\ndisplayed, in ordinary circumstances at least, much magnificence. The\r\naccounts of his private expenses for the years 1202 and 1203 have been\r\npreserved, which enable us to discover some curious details bearing\r\nwitness to the extreme simplicity of the court at that period. The\r\nhousehold of the King or royal family was still very small: one\r\nchancellor, one chaplain, a squire, a butler, a few Knights of the Temple,\r\nand some sergeants-at-arms were the only officers of the palace. The king\r\nand princes of his household only changed apparel three times during the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--King David playing on the Lyre, surrounded by\r\nfour Musicians.--Costumes of the Thirteenth Century (from a Miniature in a\r\nManuscript Psalter in the Imperial Library, Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe children of the King slept in sheets of serge, and their nurses were\r\ndressed in gowns of dark-coloured woollen stuff, called _brunette_. The\r\nroyal cloak, which was of scarlet, was jewelled, but the King only wore it\r\non great ceremonies. At the same time enormous expenses were incurred for\r\nimplements of war, arrows, helmets with visors, chariots, and for the\r\nmen-at-arms whom the King kept in his pay.\r\n\r\nLouis IX. personally kept up almost similar habits. The Sire de Joinville\r\ntells us in his \"Chronicles,\" that the holy King on his return from his\r\nfirst crusade, in order to repair the damage done to his treasury by the\r\nfailure of this expedition, would no longer wear costly furs nor robes of\r\nscarlet, and contented himself with common stuffs trimmed with hare-skin.\r\nHe nevertheless did not diminish the officers of his household, which had\r\nalready become numerous; and being no doubt convinced that royalty\r\nrequired magnificence, he surrounded himself with as much pomp as the\r\ntimes permitted.\r\n\r\nUnder the two Philips, his successors, this magnificence increased, and\r\ndescended to the great vassals, who were soon imitated by the knights\r\n\"bannerets.\" There seemed to be a danger of luxury becoming so great, and\r\nso general in all classes of feudal society, that in 1294 an order of the\r\nKing was issued, regulating in the minutest details the expenses of each\r\nperson according to his rank in the State, or the fortune which he could\r\nprove. But this law had the fate of all such enactments, and was either\r\neasily evaded, or was only partially enforced, and that with great\r\ndifficulty. Another futile attempt to put it in practice was made in 1306,\r\nwhen the splendour of dress, of equipages, and of table had become still\r\ngreater and more ruinous, and had descended progressively to the bourgeois\r\nand merchants.\r\n\r\nIt must be stated in praise of Philip le Bel (Fig. 50) that,\r\nnotwithstanding the failure of his attempts to arrest the progress of\r\nluxury, he was not satisfied with making laws against the extravagances of\r\nhis subjects, for we find that he studied a strict economy in his own\r\nhousehold, which recalled the austere times of Philip Augustus. Thus, in\r\nthe curious regulations relating to the domestic arrangements of the\r\npalace, the Queen, Jeanne de Navarre, was only allowed two ladies and\r\nthree maids of honour in her suite, and she is said to have had only two\r\nfour-horse carriages, one for herself and the other for these ladies. In\r\nanother place these regulations require that a butler, specially\r\nappointed, \"should buy all the cloth and furs for the king, take charge of\r\nthe key of the cupboards where these are kept, know the quantity given to\r\nthe tailors to make clothes, and check the accounts when the tailors send\r\nin their claims for the price of their work.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--King Philip le Bel in War-dress, on the Occasion\r\nof his entering Paris in 1304, after having conquered the Communes of\r\nFlanders.--Equestrian Statue placed in Notre Dame, Paris, and destroyed in\r\n1772.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut from Thevet's \"Cosmographie Universelle,\"\r\n1575.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the pious Jeanne de Navarre, to whom perhaps we must\r\nattribute the wise measures of her husband, Philip le Bel, the expenses of\r\nthe royal household materially increased, especially on the occasions of\r\nthe marriages of the three young sons of the King, from 1305 to 1307.\r\nGold, diamonds, pearls, and precious stones were employed profusely, both\r\nfor the King's garments and for those of the members of the royal family.\r\nThe accounts of 1307 mention considerable sums paid for carpets,\r\ncounterpanes, robes, worked linen, &c. A chariot of state, ornamented and\r\ncovered with paintings, and gilded like the back of an altar, is also\r\nmentioned, and must have been a great change to the heavy vehicles used\r\nfor travelling in those days.\r\n\r\nDown to the reign of St. Louis the furniture of castles had preserved a\r\ncharacter of primitive simplicity which did not, however, lack grandeur.\r\nThe stone remained uncovered in most of the halls, or else it was whitened\r\nwith mortar and ornamented with moulded roses and leaves, coloured in\r\ndistemper. Against the wall, and also against the pillars supporting the\r\narches, arms and armour of all sorts were hung, arranged in suits, and\r\ninterspersed with banners and pennants or emblazoned standards. In the\r\ngreat middle hall, or dining-room, there was a long massive oak table,\r\nwith benches and stools of the same wood. At the end of this table, there\r\nwas a large arm-chair, overhung with a canopy of golden or silken stuff,\r\nwhich was occupied by the owner of the castle, and only relinquished by\r\nhim in favour of his superior or sovereign. Often the walls of the hall of\r\nstate were hung with tapestry, representing groves with cattle, heroes of\r\nancient history, or events in the romance of chivalry. The floor was\r\ngenerally paved with hard stone, or covered with enamelled tiles. It was\r\ncarefully strewn with scented herbs in summer, and straw in winter. Philip\r\nAugustus ordered that the Hôtel Dieu of Paris should receive the herbs and\r\nstraw which was daily removed from the floors of his palace. It was only\r\nvery much later that this troublesome system was replaced by mats and\r\ncarpets.\r\n\r\nThe bedrooms were generally at the top of the towers, and had little else\r\nby way of furniture, besides a very large bed, with or without curtains, a\r\nbox in which clothes were kept, and which also served as a seat, and a\r\n_priedieu_ chair, which sometimes contained prayer and other books of\r\ndevotion. These lofty rooms, whose thick walls kept out the heat in\r\nsummer, and the cold in winter, were only lighted by a small window or\r\nloophole, closed with a square of oiled paper or of thin horn.\r\n\r\nA great change took place in the abodes of the nobility in the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries (Fig. 51). We find, for instance, in Sauval's\r\n\"History and Researches of the Antiquities of the City of Paris,\" that the\r\nabodes of the kings of the first dynasty had been transformed into\r\nPalaces of Justice by Philip le Bel; the same author also gives us a vivid\r\ndescription of the Château du Louvre, and the Hôtel St. Paul, which the\r\nkings inhabited when their court was in the capital. But even without\r\nexamining into all the royal abodes, it will suffice to give an account of\r\nthe Hôtel de Bohême, which, after having been the home of the Sires de\r\nNesles, of Queen Blanche of Castille, and other great persons, was given\r\nby Charles VI., in 1388, to his brother, the famous Duke Louis of Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--The Knight and his Lady.--Costumes of the Court\r\nof Burgundy in the Fourteenth Century; Furnished Chamber.--Miniature in\r\n\"Othea,\" Poem by Christine de Pisan (Brussels Library).]\r\n\r\n\"I shall not attempt,\" says Sauval, \"to speak of the cellars and\r\nwine-cellars, the bakehouses, the fruiteries, the salt-stores, the\r\nfur-rooms, the porters' lodges, the stores, the guard-rooms, the\r\nwood-yard, or the glass-stores; nor of the servants; nor of the place\r\nwhere _hypocras_ was made; neither shall I describe the tapestry-room, the\r\nlinen-room, nor the laundry; nor, indeed, any of the various conveniences\r\nwhich were then to be found in the yards of that palace as well as in the\r\nother abodes of the princes and nobles.\r\n\r\n\"I shall simply remark, that amongst the many suites of rooms which\r\ncomposed it, two occupied the two first stories of the main building; the\r\nfirst was raised some few steps above the ground-floor of the court, and\r\nwas occupied by Valentine de Milan; and her husband, Louis of Orleans,\r\ngenerally occupied the second. Each of these suites of rooms consisted of\r\na great hall, a chamber of state, a large chamber, a wardrobe, some\r\nclosets, and a chapel. The windows of the halls were thirteen and a half\r\nfeet[A] high by four and a half wide. The state chambers were eight\r\n'toises,' that is, about fifty feet and a half long. The duke and\r\nduchess's chambers were six 'toises' by three, that is, about thirty-six\r\nfeet by eighteen; the others were seven toises and a half square, all\r\nlighted by long and narrow windows of wirework with trellis-work of iron;\r\nthe wainscots and the ceilings were made of Irish wood, the same as at the\r\nLouvre.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: French feet.]\r\n\r\nIn this palace there was a room used by the duke, hung with cloth of gold,\r\nbordered with vermilion velvet embroidered with roses; the duchess had a\r\nroom hung with vermilion satin embroidered with crossbows, which were on\r\nher coat of arms; that of the Duke of Burgundy was hung with cloth of gold\r\nembroidered with windmills. There were, besides, eight carpets of glossy\r\ntexture, with gold flowers; one representing \"The Seven Virtues and the\r\nSeven Vices;\" another the history of Charlemagne; another that of St.\r\nLouis. There were also cushions of cloth of gold, twenty-four pieces of\r\nvermilion leather of Aragon, and four carpets of Aragon leather, \"to be\r\nplaced on the floor of rooms in summer.\" The favourite arm-chair of the\r\nprincess is thus described in an inventory:--\"A chamber chair with four\r\nsupports, painted in fine vermilion, the seat and arms of which are\r\ncovered with vermilion morocco, or cordovan, worked and stamped with\r\ndesigns representing the sun, birds, and other devices, bordered with\r\nfringes of silk and studded with nails.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the ornamental furniture were--\"A large vase of massive silver, for\r\nholding sugar-plums or sweetmeats, shaped like a square table, supported\r\nby four satyrs, also of silver; a fine wooden casket, covered with\r\nvermilion cordovan, nailed, and bordered with a narrow gilt band, shutting\r\nwith a key.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Bronze Chandeliers of the Fourteenth Century\r\n(Collection of M. Ach. Jubinal).]\r\n\r\nIn the daily life of Louis of Orleans and his wife, everything\r\ncorresponded with the luxury of their house. Thus, for the amusement of\r\ntheir children, two little books of pictures were made, illuminated with\r\ngold, azure, and vermilion, and covered with vermilion leather of Cordova,\r\nwhich cost sixty _sols parisis, i.e. four hundred francs. But it was in\r\nthe custom of New Year's gifts that the duke and duchess displayed truly\r\nroyal magnificence, as we find described in the accounts of their\r\nexpenses. For instance, in 1388 they paid four hundred francs of gold for\r\nsheets of silk to give to those who received the New Year's gifts from the\r\nKing and Queen. In 1402, one hundred pounds (tournois) were given to Jehan\r\nTaienne, goldsmith, for six silver cups presented to Jacques de Poschin,\r\nthe Duke's squire. To the Sire de la Trémouille Valentine gives \"a cup and\r\nbasin of gold;\" to Queen Isabella, \"a golden image of St. John,\r\nsurrounded with nine rubies, one sapphire, and twenty-one pearls;\" to\r\nMademoiselle de Luxembourg, \"another small golden sacred image, surrounded\r\nwith pearls;\" and lastly, in an account of 1394, headed, \"Portion of gold\r\nand silver jewels bought by Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans as a New Year's\r\ngift,\" we find \"a clasp of gold, studded with one large ruby and six large\r\npearls, given to the King; three paternosters for the King's daughters,\r\nand two large diamonds for the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Styli used in writing in the Fourteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the habits in private life of the royal princes under Charles\r\nVI.; and it can easily be shown that the example of royalty was followed\r\nnot only by the court, but also in the remotest provinces. The great\r\ntenants or vassals of the crown each possessed several splendid mansions\r\nin their fiefs; the Dukes of Burgundy, at Souvigny, at Moulins, and at\r\nBourbon l'Archambault; the Counts of Champagne, at Troyes; the Dukes of\r\nBurgundy, at Dijon; and all the smaller nobles made a point of imitating\r\ntheir superiors. From the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries, the\r\nprovinces which now compose France were studded with castles, which were\r\nas remarkable for their interior, architecture as for the richness of\r\ntheir furniture; and it may be asserted that the luxury which was\r\ndisplayed in the dwellings of the nobility was the evidence, if not the\r\nresuit, of a great social revolution in the manners and customs of private\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourteenth century there lived a much-respected noble of\r\nAnjou, named Geoffroy de Latour-Landry, who had three daughters. In his\r\nold age, he resolved that, considering the dangers which might surround\r\nthem in consequence of their inexperience and beauty, he would compose for\r\ntheir use a code of admonitions which might guide them in the various\r\ncircumstances of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Young Mother's Retinue\r\n\r\nRepresenting the Parisian costumes at the end of the fourteenth century.\r\nFac-simile of a miniature from the latin _Terence_ of King Charles VI.\r\nFrom a manuscript in the Bibl. de l'Arsenal.]\r\n\r\nThis book of domestic maxims is most curious and instructive, from the\r\ndetails which it contains respecting the manners and customs, mode of\r\nconduct, and fashions of the nobility of the period (Fig. 54). The author\r\nmostly illustrates each of his precepts by examples from the life of\r\ncontemporary personages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Dress of Noble Ladies and Children in the\r\nFourteenth Century.--Miniature in the \"Merveilles du Monde\" (Manuscript,\r\nNational Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe first advice the knight gives his daughters is, to begin the day with\r\nprayer; and, in order to give greater weight to his counsel, he relates\r\nthe following anecdote: \"A noble had two daughters; the one was pious,\r\nalways saying her prayers with devotion, and regularly attending the\r\nservices of the church; she married an honest man, and was most happy. The\r\nother, on the contrary, was satisfied with hearing low mass, and hurrying\r\nonce or twice through the Lord's Prayer, after which she went off to\r\nindulge herself with sweetmeats. She complained of headaches, and required\r\ncareful diet. She married a most excellent knight; but, one evening,\r\ntaking advantage of her husband being asleep, she shut herself up in one\r\nof the rooms of the palace, and in company with the people of the\r\nhousehold began eating and drinking in the most riotous and excessive\r\nmanner. The knight awoke; and, surprised not to find his wife by his side,\r\ngot up, and, armed with a stick, betook himself to the scene of festivity.\r\nHe struck one of the domestics with such force that he broke his stick in\r\npieces, and one of the fragments flew into the lady's eye and put it out.\r\nThis caused her husband to take a dislike to her, and he soon placed his\r\naffections elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"My pretty daughters,\" the moralising parent proceeds, \"be courteous and\r\nmeek, for nothing is more beautiful, nothing so secures the favour of God\r\nand the love of others. Be then courteous to great and small; speak gently\r\nwith them.... I have seen a great lady take off her cap and bow to a\r\nsimple ironmonger. One of her followers seemed astonished. 'I prefer,' she\r\nsaid, 'to have been too courteous towards that man, than to have been\r\nguilty of the least incivility to a knight.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Noble Lady and Maid of Honour, and two Burgesses\r\nwith Hoods (Fourteenth Century), from a Miniature in the \"Merveilles du\r\nMonde\" (Manuscript in the Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nLatour-Landry also advised his daughters to avoid outrageous fashions in\r\ndress. \"Do not be hasty in copying the dress of foreign women. I will\r\nrelate a story on this subject respecting a bourgeoise of Guyenne and the\r\nSire de Beaumanoir. The lady said to him, 'Cousin, I come from Brittany,\r\nwhere I saw my fine cousin, your wife, who was not so well dressed as the\r\nladies of Guyenne and many other places. The borders of her dress and of\r\nher bonnet are not in fashion.' The Sire answered, 'Since you find fault\r\nwith the dress and cap of my wife, and as they do not suit you, I shall\r\ntake care in future that they are changed; but I shall be careful not to\r\nchoose them similar to yours.... Understand, madam, that I wish her to be\r\ndressed according to the fashion of the good ladies of France and this\r\ncountry, and not like those of England. It was these last who first\r\nintroduced into Brittany the large borders, the bodices opened on the\r\nhips, and the hanging sleeves. I remember the time, and saw it myself, and\r\nI have little respect for women who adopt these fashions.'\"\r\n\r\nRespecting the high head-dresses \"which cause women to resemble stags who\r\nare obliged to lower their heads to enter a wood,\" the knight relates what\r\ntook place in 1392 at the fête of St. Marguerite. \"There was a young and\r\npretty woman there, quite differently dressed from the others; every one\r\nstared at her as if she had been a wild beast. One respectable lady\r\napproached her and said, 'My friend, what do you call that fashion?' She\r\nanswered, 'It is called the \"gibbet dress.\"' 'Indeed; but that is not a\r\nfine name!' answered the old lady. Very soon the name of 'gibbet dress'\r\ngot known all round the room, and every one laughed at the foolish\r\ncreature who was thus bedecked.\" This head-dress did in fact owe its name\r\nto its summit, which resembled a gibbet.\r\n\r\nThese extracts from the work of this honest knight, suffice to prove that\r\nthe customs of French society had, as early as the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, taken a decided character which was to remain subject only to\r\nmodifications introduced at various historical periods.\r\n\r\nAmongst the customs which contributed most to the softening and elegance\r\nof the feudal class, we must cite that of sending into the service of the\r\nsovereign for some years all the youths of both sexes, under the names of\r\nvarlets, pages, squires, and maids of honour. No noble, of whatever wealth\r\nor power, ever thought of depriving his family of this apprenticeship and\r\nits accompanying chivalric education.\r\n\r\nUp to the end of the twelfth century, the number of domestic officers\r\nattached to a castle was very limited; we have seen, for instance, that\r\nPhilip Augustus contented himself with a few servants, and his queen with\r\ntwo or three maids of honour. Under Louis IX. this household was much\r\nincreased, and under Philippe le Bel and his sons the royal household had\r\nbecome so considerable as to constitute quite a large assemblage of young\r\nmen and women. Under Charles VI., the household of Queen Isabella of\r\nBavaria alone amounted to forty-five persons, without counting the\r\nalmoner, the chaplains, and clerks of the chapel, who must have been very\r\nnumerous, since the sums paid to them amounted to the large amount of four\r\nhundred and sixty francs of gold per annum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Court of the Ladies of Queen Anne of Brittany,\r\nMiniature representing this lady weeping on account of the absence of her\r\nhusband during the Italian war.--Manuscript of the \"Epistres Envoyées au\r\nRoi\" (Sixteenth Century), obtained by the Coislin Fund for the Library of\r\nSt. Germain des Pres in Paris, now in the Library of St. Petersburg.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I., the service of the young\r\nnobility, which was called \"apprenticeship of honour or virtue,\" had\r\ntaken a much wider range; for the first families of the French nobility\r\nwere most eager to get their children admitted into the royal household,\r\neither to attend on the King or Queen, or at any rate on one of the\r\nprinces of the royal blood. Anne of Brittany particularly gave special\r\nattention to her female attendants (Fig. 56). \"She was the first,\" says\r\nBrantôme in his work on \"Illustrious Women,\" \"who began to form the great\r\ncourt of ladies which has descended to our days; for she had a\r\nconsiderable retinue both of adult ladies and young girls. She never\r\nrefused to receive any one; on the contrary, she inquired of the gentlemen\r\nof the court if they had any daughters, ascertained who they were, and\r\nasked for them.\" It was thus that the Admiral de Graville (Fig. 57)\r\nconfided to the good Queen the education of his daughter Anne, who at this\r\nschool of the Court of Ladies became one of the most distinguished women\r\nof her day. The same Queen, as Duchess of Brittany, created a company of\r\none hundred Breton gentlemen, who accompanied her everywhere. \"They never\r\nfailed,\" says the author of \"Illustrious Women,\" \"when she went to mass or\r\ntook a walk, to await her return on the little terrace of Blois, which is\r\nstill called the _Perche aux Bretons_. She gave it this name herself; for\r\nwhen she saw them she said, 'There are my Bretons on the perch waiting for\r\nme.'\"\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that this queen, who became successively the wife of\r\nCharles VIII. and of Louis XII., had taken care to establish a strict\r\ndiscipline amongst the young men and women who composed her court. She\r\nrightly considered herself the guardian of the honour of the former, and\r\nof the virtue of the latter; therefore, as long as she lived, her court\r\nwas renowned for purity and politeness, noble and refined gallantry, and\r\nwas never allowed to degenerate into imprudent amusements or licentious\r\nand culpable intrigues.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the moral influence of this worthy princess died with her.\r\nAlthough the court of France continued to gather around it almost every\r\nsort of elegance, and although it continued during the whole of the\r\nsixteenth century the most polished of European courts, notwithstanding\r\nthe great external and civil wars, yet it afforded at the same time a sad\r\nexample of laxity of morals, which had a most baneful influence on public\r\nhabits; so much so that vice and corruption descended from class to class,\r\nand contaminated all orders of society. If we wished to make\r\ninvestigations into the private life of the lower orders in those times,\r\nwe should not succeed as we have been able to do with that of the upper\r\nclasses; for we have scarcely any data to throw light upon their sad and\r\nobscure history. Bourgeois and peasants were, as we have already shown,\r\nlong included together with the miserable class of serfs, a herd of human\r\nbeings without individuality, without significance, who from their birth\r\nto their death, whether isolated or collectively, were the \"property\" of\r\ntheir masters. What must have been the private life of this degraded\r\nmultitude, bowed down under the most tyrannical and humiliating\r\ndependence, we can scarcely imagine; it was in fact but a purely material\r\nexistence, which has left scarcely any trace in history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Louis de Mallet, Lord of Graville, Admiral of\r\nFrance, 1487, in Costume of War and Tournament, from an Engraving of the\r\nSixteenth Century (National Library of Paris, Cabinet des Estampes).]\r\n\r\nMany centuries elapsed before the dawn of liberty could penetrate the\r\nsocial strata of this multitude, thus oppressed and denuded of all power\r\nof action. The development was slow, painful, and dearly bought, but at\r\nlast it took place; first of all towns sprang up, and with them, or rather\r\nby their influence, the inhabitants became possessed of social life. The\r\nagricultural population took its social position many generations later.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the great movement for the creation of communes\r\nand bourgeoisies only dates from the unsettled period ranging from the\r\neleventh to the thirteenth centuries, and simultaneously we see the\r\nbourgeois appear, already rich and luxurious, parading on all occasions\r\ntheir personal opulence. Their private life could only be an imitation of\r\nthat in the châteaux; by degrees as wealth strengthened and improved their\r\ncondition, and rendered them independent, we find them trying to procure\r\nluxuries equal or analogous to those enjoyed by the upper classes, and\r\nwhich appeared to them the height of material happiness. In all times the\r\nsmall have imitated the great. It was in vain that the great obstinately\r\nthreatened, by the exercise of their prerogatives, to try and crush this\r\ntendency to equality which alarmed them, by issuing pecuniary edicts,\r\nsummary laws, coercive regulations, and penal ordinances; by the force of\r\ncircumstances the arbitrary restrictions which the nobility laid upon the\r\nlower classes gradually disappeared, and the power of wealth displayed\r\nitself in spite of all their efforts to suppress it. In fact, occasions\r\nwere not wanting in which the bourgeois class was able to refute the\r\ncharge of unworthiness with which the nobles sought to stamp it. When\r\ntaking a place in the council of the King, or employed in the\r\nadministration of the provinces, many of its members distinguished\r\nthemselves by firmness and wisdom; when called upon to assist in the\r\nnational defence, they gave their blood and their gold with noble\r\nself-denial; and lastly, they did not fail to prove themselves possessed\r\nof those high and delicate sentiments of which the nobility alone claimed\r\nthe hereditary possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Burgess of Ghent and his Wife, in ceremonial\r\nAttire, kneeling in Church, from a painted Window belonging to a Chapel in\r\nthat Town (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\n\"The bourgeois,\" says Arnaud de Marveil, one of the most famous\r\ntroubadours of the thirteenth century, \"have divers sorts of merits: some\r\ndistinguish themselves by deeds of honour, others are by nature noble and\r\nbehave accordingly. There are others thoroughly brave, courteous, frank,\r\nand jovial, who, although poor, find means to please by graceful speech,\r\nfrequenting courts, and making themselves agreeable there; these, well\r\nversed in courtesy and politeness, appear in noble attire, and figure\r\nconspicuously at the tournaments and military games, proving themselves\r\ngood judges and good company.\"\r\n\r\nDown to the thirteenth century, however rich their fathers or husbands\r\nmight be, the women of the bourgeoisie were not permitted, without\r\nincurring a fine, to use the ornaments and stuffs exclusively reserved for\r\nthe nobility. During the reigns of Philip Augustus and Louis IX., although\r\nthese arbitrary laws were not positively abolished, a heavy blow was\r\ninflicted on them by the marks of confidence, esteem, and honour which\r\nthese monarchs found pleasure in bestowing on the bourgeoisie. We find the\r\nfirst of these kings, when on the point of starting for a crusade,\r\nchoosing six from amongst the principal members of the _parloir aux\r\nbourgeois_ (it was thus that the first Hôtel de Ville, situated in the\r\ncorner of the Place de la Grève, was named) to be attached to the Council\r\nof Regency, to whom he specially confided his will and the royal treasure.\r\nHis grandson made a point of following his grandsire's example, and Louis\r\nIX. showed the same appreciation for the new element which the Parisian\r\nbourgeoisie was about to establish in political life by making the\r\nbourgeois Etienne Boileau one of his principal ministers of police, and\r\nthe bourgeois Jean Sarrazin his chamberlain.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the whole bourgeoisie gloried in the marks of\r\ndistinction conferred upon their representatives, and during the following\r\nreign, the ladies of this class, proud of their immense fortunes, but\r\nabove all proud of the municipal powers held by their families, bedecked\r\nthemselves, regardless of expense, with costly furs and rich stuffs,\r\nnotwithstanding that they were forbidden by law to do so.\r\n\r\nThen came an outcry on the part of the nobles; and we read as follows, in\r\nan edict of Philippe le Bel, who inclined less to the bourgeoisie than to\r\nthe nobles, and who did not spare the former in matters of taxation:--\"No\r\nbourgeois shall have a chariot nor wear gold, precious stones, or crowns\r\nof gold or silver. Bourgeois, not being either prelates nor dignitaries of\r\nstate, shall not have tapers of wax. A bourgeois possessing two thousand\r\npounds (tournois) or more, may order for himself a dress of twelve sous\r\nsix deniers, and for his wife one worth sixteen sous at the most.\" The\r\nsou, which was but nominal money, may be reckoned as representing twenty\r\nfrancs, and the denier one franc, but allowance must be made for the\r\nenormous difference in the value of silver, which would make twenty francs\r\nin the thirteenth century represent upwards of two hundred francs of\r\npresent currency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--The new-born Child, from a Miniature in the\r\n\"Histoire de la Belle Hélaine\" (Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century,\r\nNational Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nBut these regulations as to the mode of living were so little or so\r\ncarelessly observed, that all the successors of Philippe le Bel thought it\r\nnecessary to re-enact them, and, indeed, Charles VII., one century later,\r\nwas obliged to censure the excess of luxury in dress by an edict which\r\nwas, however, no better enforced than the rest. \"It has been shown to the\r\nsaid lord\" (the King Charles VII.), \"that of all nations of the habitable\r\nglobe there are none so changeable, outrageous, and excessive in their\r\nmanner of dress, as the French nation, and there is no possibility of\r\ndiscovering by their dress the state or calling of persons, be they\r\nprinces, nobles, bourgeois, or working men, because all are allowed to\r\ndress as they think proper, whether in gold or silver, silk or wool,\r\nwithout any regard to their calling.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, a rich merchant of Valenciennes went\r\nto the court of the King of France wearing a cloak of furs covered with\r\ngold and pearls; seeing that no one offered him a cushion, he proudly sat\r\non his cloak. On leaving he did not attempt to take up the cloak; and on a\r\nservant calling his attention to the fact he remarked, \"It is not the\r\ncustom in my country for people to carry away their cushions with them.\"\r\n\r\nRespecting a journey made by Philippe le Bel and his wife Jeanne de\r\nNavarre to the towns of Bruges and Ghent, the historian Jean Mayer relates\r\nthat Jeanne, on seeing the costly array of the bourgeois of those two rich\r\ncities, exclaimed, \"I thought I was the only queen here, but I see more\r\nthan six hundred!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the laws, the Parisian bourgeoisie soon rivalled the Flemish\r\nin the brilliancy of their dress. Thus, in the second half of the\r\nfourteenth century, the famous Christine de Pisan relates that, having\r\ngone to visit the wife of a merchant during her confinement, it was not\r\nwithout some amazement that she saw the sumptuous furniture of the\r\napartment in which this woman lay in bed (Fig. 59). The walls were hung\r\nwith precious tapestry of Cyprus, on which the initials and motto of the\r\nlady were embroidered; the sheets were of fine linen of Rheims, and had\r\ncost more than three hundred pounds; the quilt was a new invention of silk\r\nand silver tissue; the carpet was like gold. The lady wore an elegant\r\ndress of crimson silk, and rested her head and arms on pillows, ornamented\r\nwith buttons of oriental pearls. It should be remarked that this lady was\r\nnot the wife of a large merchant, such as those of Venice and Genoa, but\r\nof a simple retail dealer, who was not above selling articles for four\r\nsous; such being the case, we need not be surprised that Christine should\r\nhave considered the anecdote \"worthy of being immortalised in a book.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be assumed that the sole aim of the bourgeoisie was\r\nthat of making a haughty and pompous display. This is refuted by the\r\ntestimony of the \"Ménagier de Paris,\" a curious anonymous work, the author\r\nof which must have been an educated and enlightened bourgeois.\r\n\r\nThe \"Ménagier,\" which was first published by the Baron Jérôme Pichon, is a\r\ncollection of counsels addressed by a husband to his young wife, as to her\r\nconduct in society, in the world, and in the management of her household.\r\nThe first part is devoted to developing the mind of the young housewife;\r\nand the second relates to the arrangements necessary for the welfare of\r\nher house. It must be remembered that the comparatively trifling duties\r\nrelating to the comforts of private life, which devolved on the wife, were\r\nnot so numerous in those days as they are now; but on the other hand they\r\nrequired an amount of practical knowledge on the part of the housewife\r\nwhich she can nowadays dispense with. Under this head the \"Ménagier\" is\r\nfull of information.\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the prayers which a Christian woman should say\r\nmorning and evening, the author discusses the great question of dress,\r\nwhich has ever been of supreme importance in the eyes of the female sex:\r\n\"Know, dear sister,\" (the friendly name he gives his young wife), \"that in\r\nthe choice of your apparel you must always consider the rank of your\r\nparents and mine, as also the state of my fortune. Be respectably dressed,\r\nwithout devoting too much study to it, without too much plunging into new\r\nfashions. Before leaving your room, see that the collar of your gown be\r\nwell adjusted and is not put on crooked.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Sculptured Comb, in Ivory, of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury (Sauvageot Collection)]\r\n\r\nThen he dilates on the characters of women, which are too often wilful and\r\nunmanageable; on this point, for he is not less profuse in examples than\r\nthe Chevalier de Latour-Landry, he relates an amusing anecdote, worthy of\r\nbeing repeated and remembered.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the bailiff of Tournay relate, that he had found himself\r\nseveral times at table with men long married, and that he had wagered with\r\nthem the price of a dinner under the following conditions: the company\r\nwas to visit the abode of each of the husbands successively, and any one\r\nwho had a wife obedient enough immediately, without contradicting or\r\nmaking any remark, to consent to count up to four, would win the bet; but,\r\non the other hand, those whose wives showed temper, laughed, or refused to\r\nobey, would lose. Under these conditions the company gaily adjourned to\r\nthe abode of Robin, whose wife, called Marie, had a high opinion of\r\nherself. The husband said before all, 'Marie, repeat after me what I shall\r\nsay.' 'Willingly, sire.' 'Marie, say, \"One, two, three!\"' But by this time\r\nMarie was out of patience, and said, 'And seven, and twelve, and fourteen!\r\nWhy, you are making a fool of me!' So that husband lost his wager.\r\n\r\n\"The company next went to the house of Maître Jean, whose wife, Agnescat\r\nwell knew how to play the lady. Jean said, 'Repeat after me, one!' 'And\r\ntwo!' answered Agnescat disdainfully; so he lost his wager. Tassin then\r\ntried, and said to dame Tassin, 'Count one!' 'Go upstairs!' she answered,\r\n'if you want to teach counting, I am not a child.' Another said, 'Go away\r\nwith you; you must have lost your senses,' or similar words, which made\r\nthe husbands lose their wagers. Those, on the contrary, who had\r\nwell-behaved wives gained their wager and went away joyful.\"\r\n\r\nThis amusing quotation suffices to show that the author of the \"Ménagier\r\nde Paris\" wished to adopt a jocose style, with a view to enliven the\r\nseriousness of the subject he was advocating.\r\n\r\nThe part of his work in which he discusses the administration of the house\r\nis not less worthy of attention. One of the most curious chapters of the\r\nwork is that in which he points out the manner in which the young\r\nbourgeoise is to behave towards persons in her service. Rich people in\r\nthose days, in whatever station of life, were obliged to keep a numerous\r\nretinue of servants. It is curious to find that so far back as the period\r\nto which we allude, there was in Paris a kind of servants' registry\r\noffice, where situations were found for servant-maids from the country.\r\nThe bourgeois gave up the entire management of the servants to his wife;\r\nbut, on account of her extreme youth, the author of the work in question\r\nrecommends his wife only to engage servants who shall have been chosen by\r\nDame Agnes, the nun whom he had placed with her as a kind of governess or\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Before engaging them,\" he says, \"know whence they come; in what houses\r\nthey have been; if they have acquaintances in town, and if they are\r\nsteady. Discover what they are capable of doing; and ascertain that they\r\nare not greedy, or inclined to drink. If they come from another country,\r\ntry to find out why they left it; for, generally, it is not without some\r\nserious reason that a woman decides upon a change of abode. When you have\r\nengaged a maid, do not permit her to take the slightest liberty with you,\r\nnor allow her to speak disrespectfully to you. If, on the contrary, she be\r\nquiet in her demeanour, honest, modest, and shows herself amenable to\r\nreproof, treat her as if she were your daughter.\r\n\r\n\"Superintend the work to be done; and choose among your servants those\r\nqualified for each special department. If you order a thing to be done\r\nimmediately, do not be satisfied with the following answers: 'It shall be\r\ndone presently, or to-morrow early;' otherwise, be sure that you will have\r\nto repeat your orders.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Dress of Maidservants in the Thirteenth\r\nCentury.--Miniature in a Manuscript of the National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nTo these severe instructions upon the management of servants, the\r\nbourgeois adds a few words respecting their morality. He recommends that\r\nthey be not permitted to use coarse or indecent language, or to insult one\r\nanother (Fig. 61). Although he is of opinion that necessary time should be\r\ngiven to servants at their meals, he does not approve of their remaining\r\ndrinking and talking too long at table: concerning which practice he\r\nquotes a proverb in use at that time: \"Quand varlet presche à table et\r\ncheval paist en gué, il est temps qu'on l'en oste: assez y a esté;\" which\r\nmeans, that when a servant talks at table and a horse feeds near a\r\nwatering-place it is time he should be removed; he has been there long\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Hôtel des Ursins, Paris, built during the\r\nFourteenth Century, restored in the Sixteenth, and now destroyed.--State\r\nof the North Front at the End of the last Century.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the author concludes his instruction proves his\r\nkindness of heart, as well as his benevolence: \"If one of your servants\r\nfall sick, it is your duty, setting everything else aside, to see to his\r\nbeing cured.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that a bourgeois of the fifteenth century expressed himself;\r\nand as it is clear that he could only have been inspired to dictate his\r\ntheoretical teachings by the practical experience which he must have\r\ngained for the most part among the middle class to which he belonged, we\r\nmust conclude that in those days the bourgeoisie possessed considerable\r\nknowledge of moral dignity and social propriety.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that by the side of the merchant and working\r\nbourgeoisie--who, above all, owed their greatness to the high functions of\r\nthe municipality--the parliamentary bourgeoisie had raised itself to\r\npower, and that from the fourteenth century it played a considerable part\r\nin the State, holding at several royal courts at different periods, and at\r\nlast, almost hereditarily, the highest magisterial positions. The very\r\ncharacter of these great offices of president, or of parliamentary\r\ncounsel, barristers, &c., proves that the holders must have had no small\r\namount of intellectual culture. In this way a refined taste was created\r\namong this class, which the protection of kings, princes, and lords had\r\nalone hitherto encouraged. We find, for example, the Grosliers at Lyons,\r\nthe De Thous and Seguiers in Paris, regardless of their bourgeois origin,\r\nbecoming judicious and zealous patrons of poets, scholars, and artists.\r\n\r\nA description of Paris, published in the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\ndescribes amongst the most splendid residences of the capital the hotels\r\nof Juvénal des Ursins (Fig. 62), of Bureau de Dampmartin, of Guillaume\r\nSeguin, of Mille Baillet, of Martin Double, and particularly that of\r\nJacques Duchié, situated in the Rue des Prouvaires, in which were\r\ncollected at great cost collections of all kinds of arms, musical\r\ninstruments, rare birds, tapestry, and works of art. In each church in\r\nParis, and there were upwards of a hundred, the principal chapels were\r\nfounded by celebrated families of the ancient bourgeoisie, who had left\r\nmoney for one or more masses to be said daily for the repose of the soûls\r\nof their deceased members. In the burial-grounds, and principally in that\r\nof the Innocents, the monuments of these families of Parisian bourgeoisie\r\nwere of the most expensive character, and were inscribed with epitaphs in\r\nwhich the living vainly tried to immortalise the deeds of the deceased.\r\nEvery one has heard of the celebrated tomb of Nicholas Flamel and Pernelle\r\nhis wife (Fig. 63), the cross of Bureau, the epitaph of Yolande Bailly,\r\nwho died in 1514, at the age of eighty-eight, and who \"saw, or might have\r\nseen, two hundred and ninety-five children descended from her.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the religious institutions of Paris afford much curious and\r\ninteresting information relative to the history of the bourgeoisie. For\r\ninstance, Jean Alais, who levied a tax of one denier on each basket of\r\nfish brought to market, and thereby amassed an enormous fortune, left the\r\nwhole of it at his death for the purpose of erecting a chapel called St.\r\nAgnes, which soon after became the church of St. Eustace. He further\r\ndirected that, by way of expiation, his body should be thrown into the\r\nsewer which drained the offal from the market, and covered with a large\r\nstone; this sewer up to the end of the last century was still called Pont\r\nAlais.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Nicholas Flamel and Pernelle, his Wife, from a\r\nPainting executed at the End of the Fifteenth Century, under the Vaults of\r\nthe Cemetery of the Innocents, in Paris.]\r\n\r\nVery often when citizens made gifts during their lifetime to churches or\r\nparishes, the donors reserved to themselves certain privileges which were\r\ncalculated to cause the motives which had actuated them to be open to\r\ncriticism. Thus, in 1304, the daughters of Nicholas Arrode, formerly\r\nprovost of the merchants, presented to the church of St.\r\nJacques-la-Boucherie the house and grounds which they inhabited, but one\r\nof them reserved the right of having a key of the church that she might\r\ngo in whenever she pleased. Guillaume Haussecuel, in 1405, bought a\r\nsimilar right for the sum of eighteen _sols parisis_ per annum (equal to\r\ntwenty-five francs); and Alain and his wife, whose house was close to two\r\nchapels of the church, undertook not to build so as in any way to shut out\r\nthe light from one of the chapels on condition that they might open a\r\nsmall window into the chapel, and so be enabled to hear the service\r\nwithout leaving their room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Country Life--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in a folio\r\nEdition of Virgil, published at Lyons in 1517.]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the bourgeoisie, especially of Paris, gradually took a\r\nmore prominent position in history, and became so grasping after power\r\nthat it ventured, at a period which does not concern us here, to aspire to\r\nevery sort of distinction, and to secure an important social standing.\r\nWhat had been the exception during the sixteenth century became the rule\r\ntwo centuries later.\r\n\r\nWe will now take a glance at the agricultural population (Fig. 64), who,\r\nas we have already stated, were only emancipated from serfdom at the end\r\nof the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut whatever might have been formerly the civil condition of the rural\r\npopulation, everything leads us to suppose that there were no special\r\nchanges in their private and domestic means of existence from a\r\ncomparatively remote period down to almost the present time.\r\n\r\nA small poem of the thirteenth century, entitled, \"De l'Oustillement au\r\nVilain,\" gives a clear though rough sketch of the domestic state of the\r\npeasantry. Strange as it may seem, it must be acknowledged that, with a\r\nfew exceptions resulting from the progress of time, it would not be\r\ndifficult, even at the present day, to find the exact type maintained in\r\nthe country districts farthest away from the capital and large towns; at\r\nall events, they were faithfully represented at the time of the revolution\r\nof 1789.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Sedentary Occupations of the\r\nPeasauts.--Fac-simile from an Engraving on Wood, attributed to Holbein, in\r\nthe \"Cosmographie\" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]\r\n\r\nWe gather from this poem, which must be considered an authentic and most\r\ninteresting document, that the _manse_ or dwelling of the villain\r\ncomprised three distinct buildings; the first for the corn, the second for\r\nthe hay and straw, the third for the man and his family. In this rustic\r\nabode a fire of vine branches and faggots sparkled in a large chimney\r\nfurnished with an iron pot-hanger, a tripod, a shovel, large fire-irons, a\r\ncauldron and a meat-hook. Next to the fireplace was an oven, and in close\r\nproximity to this an enormous bedstead, on which the villain, his wife,\r\nhis children, and even the stranger who asked for hospitality, could all\r\nbe easily accommodated; a kneading trough, a table, a bench, a cheese\r\ncupboard, a jug, and a few baskets made up the rest of the furniture. The\r\nvillain also possessed other utensils, such as a ladder, a mortar, a\r\nhand-mill--for every one then was obliged to grind his own corn; a mallet,\r\nsome nails, some gimlets, fishing lines, hooks, and baskets, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Villains before going to Work receiving their\r\nLord's Orders.--Miniature in the \"Propriétaire des Choses.\"--Manuscript of\r\nthe Fifteenth Century (Library of the Arsenal, in Paris).]\r\n\r\nHis working implements were a plough, a scythe, a spade, a hoe, large\r\nshears, a knife and a sharpening stone; he had also a waggon, with harness\r\nfor several horses, so as to be able to accomplish the different tasks\r\nrequired of him under feudal rights, either by his proper lord, or by the\r\nsovereign; for the villain was liable to be called upon to undertake\r\nevery kind of work of this sort.\r\n\r\nHis dress consisted of a blouse of cloth or skin fastened by a leather\r\nbelt round the waist, an overcoat or mantle of thick woollen stuff, which\r\nfell from his shoulders to half-way down his legs; shoes or large boots,\r\nshort woollen trousers, and from his belt there hung his wallet and a\r\nsheath for his knife (Figs. 66 and 71). He generally went bareheaded, but\r\nin cold weather or in rain he wore a sort of hat of similar stuff to his\r\ncoat, or one of felt with a broad brim. He seldom wore _mouffles_, or\r\npadded gloves, except when engaged in hedging.\r\n\r\nA small kitchen-garden, which he cultivated himself, was usually attached\r\nto the cottage, which was guarded by a large watch-dog. There was also a\r\nshed for the cows, whose milk contributed to the sustenance of the\r\nestablishment; and on the thatched roof of this and his cottage the wild\r\ncats hunted the rats and mice. The family were never idle, even in the bad\r\nseason, and the children were taught from infancy to work by the side of\r\ntheir parents (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\nIf, then, we find so much resemblance between the abodes of the villains\r\nof the thirteenth century and those of the inhabitants of the poorest\r\ncommunes of France in the present day, we may fairly infer that there must\r\nbe a great deal which is analogous between the inhabitants themselves of\r\nthe two periods; for in the châteaux as well as in the towns we find the\r\nmaterial condition of the dwellings modifying itself conjointly with that\r\nof the moral condition of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--The egotistical and envious Villain.--From a\r\nMiniature in \"Proverbes et Adages, &c.,\" Manuscript of the La Vallière\r\nFund, in the National Library of Paris, with this legend:\r\n\r\n  \"Attrapez y sont les plus fins:\r\n  Qui trop embrasse mal estraint.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"The cleverest burn their fingers at it,\r\n  And those who grasp all may lose all.\")\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother little poem entitled, \"On the Twenty-four Kinds of Villains,\"\r\ncomposed about the same period as the one above referred to, gives us a\r\ngraphic description of the varieties of character among the feudal\r\npeasants. One example is given of a man who will not tell a traveller the\r\nway, but merely in a surly way answers, \"You know it better than I\" (Fig.\r\n67). Another, sitting at his door on a Sunday, laughs at those passing by,\r\nand says to himself when he sees a gentleman going hawking with a bird on\r\nhis wrist, \"Ah! that bird will eat a hen to-day, and our children could\r\nall feast upon it!\" Another is described as a sort of madman who equally\r\ndespises God, the saints, the Church, and the nobility. His neighbour is\r\nan honest simpleton, who, stopping in admiration before the doorway of\r\nNotre Dame in Paris in order to admire the statues of Pepin, Charlemagne,\r\nand their successors, has his pocket picked of his purse. Another villain\r\nis supposed to make trade of pleading the cause of others before \"Messire\r\nle Bailli;\" he is very eloquent in trying to show that in the time of\r\ntheir ancestors the cows had a free right of pasture in such and such a\r\nmeadow, or the sheep on such and such a ridge; then there is the miser,\r\nand the speculator, who converts all his possessions into ready money, so\r\nas to purchase grain against a bad season; but of course the harvest turns\r\nout to be excellent, and he does not make a farthing, but runs away to\r\nconceal his ruin and rage. There is also the villain who leaves his plough\r\nto become a poacher. There are many other curious examples which\r\naltogether tend to prove that there has been but little change in the\r\nvillager class since the first periods of History.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--The covetous and avaricious Villain.--From a\r\nMiniature in \"Proverbes et Adages, &c,\" Manuscript in the National Library\r\nof Paris, with this legend:\r\n\r\n  \"Je suis icy levant les yeulx\r\n  Eu ce haut lieu des attendens,\r\n  En convoitant pour avoir mieulx\r\n  Prendre la lune avec les dens.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Even on this lofty height\r\n  We yet look higher,\r\n  As nothing will satisfy us\r\n  But to clutch the moon.\")\r\n]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the miseries to which they were generally subject, the\r\nrural population had their days of rest and amusement, which were then\r\nmuch more numerous than at present. At that period the festivals of the\r\nChurch were frequent and rigidly kept, and as each of them was the pretext\r\nfor a forced holiday from manual labour, the peasants thought of nothing,\r\nafter church, but of amusing themselves; they drank, talked, sang,\r\ndanced, and, above all, laughed, for the laugh of our forefathers quite\r\nrivalled the Homeric laugh, and burst forth with a noisy joviality (Fig.\r\n69).\r\n\r\nThe \"wakes,\" or evening parties, which are still the custom in most of the\r\nFrench provinces, and which are of very ancient origin, formed important\r\nevents in the private lives of the peasants. It was at these that the\r\nstrange legends and vulgar superstitions, which so long fed the minds of\r\nthe ignorant classes, were mostly created and propagated. It was there\r\nthat those extraordinary and terrible fairy tales were related, as well as\r\nthose of magicians, witches, spirits, &c. It was there that the matrons,\r\nwhose great age justified their experience, insisted on proving, by absurd\r\ntales, that they knew all the marvellous secrets for causing happiness or\r\nfor curing sickness. Consequently, in those days the most enlightened\r\nrustic never for a moment doubted the truth of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the first efforts at printing was applied to reproducing\r\nthe most ridiculous stories under the title of the \"Evangile des Conuilles\r\nou Quenouilles,\" and which had been previously circulated in manuscript,\r\nand had obtained implicit belief. The author of this remarkable collection\r\nasserts that the matrons in his neighbourhood had deputed him to put\r\ntogether in writing the sayings suitable for all conditions of rural life\r\nwhich were believed in by them and were announced at the wakes. The\r\nabsurdities and childish follies which he has dared to register under\r\ntheir dictation are almost incredible.\r\n\r\nThe \"Evangile des Quenouilles,\" which was as much believed in as Holy\r\nWrit, tells us, amongst other secrets which it contains for the advantage\r\nof the reader, that a girl wishing to know the Christian name of her\r\nfuture husband, has but to stretch the first thread she spins in the\r\nmorning across the doorway; and that the first man who passes and touches\r\nthe thread will necessarily have the same name as the man she is destined\r\nto marry.\r\n\r\nAnother of the stories in this book was, that if a woman, on leaving off\r\nwork on Saturday night, left her distaff loaded, she might be sure that\r\nthe thread she would obtain from it during the following week would only\r\nproduce linen of bad quality, which could not be bleached; this was\r\nconsidered to be proved by the fact that the Germans wore dark-brown\r\ncoloured shirts, and it was known that the women never unloaded their\r\ndistaffs from Saturday to Monday.\r\n\r\nShould a woman enter a cow-house to milk her cows without saying \"God and\r\nSt. Bridget bless you!\" she was thought to run the risk of the cows\r\nkicking and breaking the milk-pail and spilling the milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Village Feast.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut of the\r\n\"Sandrin ou Verd Galant,\" facetious Work of the End of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury (edition of 1609).]\r\n\r\nThis silly nonsense, compiled like oracles, was printed as late as 1493.\r\nEighty years later a gentleman of Brittany, named Noel du Fail, Lord of\r\nHerissaye, councillor in the Parliament of Rennes, published, under the\r\ntitle of \"Rustic and Amusing Discourses,\" a work intended to counteract\r\nthe influence of the famous \"Evangile des Quenouilles.\" This new work was\r\na simple and true sketch of country habits, and proved the elegance and\r\nartless simplicity of the author, as well as his accuracy of observation.\r\nHe begins thus: \"Occasionally, having to retire into the country more\r\nconveniently and uninterruptedly to finish some business, on a particular\r\nholiday, as I was walking I came to a neighbouring village, where the\r\ngreater part of the old and young men were assembled, in groups of\r\nseparate ages, for, according to the proverb, 'Each seeks his like.' The\r\nyoung were practising the bow, jumping, wrestling, running races, and\r\nplaying other games. The old were looking on, some sitting under an oak,\r\nwith their legs crossed, and their hats lowered over their eyes, others\r\nleaning on their elbows criticizing every performance, and refreshing the\r\nmemory of their own youth, and taking a lively interest in seeing the\r\ngambols of the young people.\"\r\n\r\nThe author states that on questioning one of the peasants to ascertain who\r\nwas the cleverest person present, the following dialogue took place: \"The\r\none you see leaning on his elbow, hitting his boots, which have white\r\nstrings, with a hazel stick, is called Anselme; he is one of the rich ones\r\nof the village, he is a good workman, and not a bad writer for the flat\r\ncountry; and the one you see by his side, with his thumb in his belt,\r\nhanging from which is a large game bag, containing spectacles and an old\r\nprayer book, is called Pasquier, one of the greatest wits within a day's\r\njourney--nay, were I to say two I should not be lying. Anyhow, he is\r\ncertainly the readiest of the whole company to open his purse to give\r\ndrink to his companions.\" \"And that one,\" I asked, \"with the large\r\nMilanese cap on his head, who holds an old book?\" \"That one,\" he answered,\r\n\"who is scratching the end of his nose with one hand and his beard with\r\nthe other?\" \"That one,\" I replied, \"and who has turned towards us?\" \"Why,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that is Roger Bontemps, a merry careless fellow, who up to the\r\nage of fifty kept the parish school; but changing his first trade he has\r\nbecome a wine-grower. However, he cannot resist the feast days, when he\r\nbrings us his old books, and reads to us as long as we choose, such works\r\nas the 'Calondrier des Bergers,' 'Fables d'Esope,' 'Le Roman de la Rose,'\r\n'Matheolus,' 'Alain Chartier,' 'Les Vigiles du feu Roy Charles,' 'Les deux\r\nGrebans,' and others. Neither, with his old habit of warbling, can he help\r\nsinging on Sundays in the choir; and he is called Huguet. The other\r\nsitting near him, looking over his shoulder into his book, and wearing a\r\nsealskin belt with a yellow buckle, is another rich peasant of the\r\nvillage, not a bad villain, named Lubin, who also lives at home, and is\r\ncalled the little old man of the neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this artistic sketch, the author dilates on the goodman Anselme. He\r\nsays: \"This good man possessed a moderate amount of knowledge, was a\r\ngoodish grammarian, a musician, somewhat of a sophist, and rather given to\r\npicking holes in others.\" Some of Anselme's conversation is also given,\r\nand after beginning by describing in glowing terms the bygone days which\r\nhe and his contemporaries had seen, and which he stated to be very\r\ndifferent to the present, he goes on to say, \"I must own, my good old\r\nfriends, that I look back with pleasure on our young days; at all events\r\nthe mode of doing things in those days was very superior and better in\r\nevery way to that of the present.... O happy days! O fortunate times when\r\nour fathers and grandfathers, whom may God absolve, were still among us!\"\r\nAs he said this, he would raise the rim of his hat. He contented himself\r\nas to dress with a good coat of thick wool, well lined according to the\r\nfashion; and for feast days and other important occasions, one of thick\r\ncloth, lined with some old gabardine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--The Shepherds celebrating the Birth of the\r\nMessiah by Songs and Dances.--Fifteenth Century.--Fac-simile of an\r\nEngraving on Wood, from a Book of Hours, printed by Anthony Verard.]\r\n\r\n\"So we see,\" says M. Le Roux de Lincy, \"at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury that the old peasants complained of the changes in the village\r\ncustoms, and of the luxury which every one wished to display in his\r\nfurniture or apparel. On this point it seems that there has been little\r\nor no change. We read that, from the time of Homer down to that of the\r\nexcellent author of 'Rustic Discourses,' and even later, the old people\r\nfound fault with the manners of the present generation and extolled those\r\nof their forefathers, which they themselves had criticized in their own\r\nyouth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Purse or Leather Bag, with Knife or Dagger of the\r\nFifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFood and Cookery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  History of Bread.--Vegetables and Plants used in\r\n  Cooking.--Fruits.--Butchers' Meat.--Poultry, Game.--Milk, Butter,\r\n  Cheese, and Eggs.--Fish and Shellfish.--Beverages, Beer, Cider, Wine,\r\n  Sweet Wine, Refreshing Drinks, Brandy.--Cookery.--Soups, Boiled Food,\r\n  Pies, Stews, Salads, Roasts, Grills.--Seasoning, Truffles, Sugar,\r\n  Verjuice.--Sweets, Desserts, Pastry.--Meals and Feasts.--Rules of\r\n  Serving at Table from the Fifteenth to the Sixteenth Centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The private life of a people,\" says Legrand d'Aussy, who had studied that\r\nof the French from a gastronomic point of view only, \"from the foundation\r\nof monarchy down to the eighteenth century, must, like that of mankind\r\ngenerally, commence with obtaining the first and most pressing of its\r\nrequirements. Not satisfied with providing food for his support, man has\r\nendeavoured to add to his food something which pleased his taste. He does\r\nnot wait to be hungry, but he anticipates that feeling, and aggravates it\r\nby condiments and seasonings. In a word his greediness has created on this\r\nscore a very complicated and wide-spread science, which, amongst nations\r\nwhich are considered civilised, has become most important, and is\r\ndesignated the culinary art.\"\r\n\r\nAt all times the people of every country have strained the nature of the\r\nsoil on which they lived by forcing it to produce that which it seemed\r\ndestined ever to refuse them. Such food as human industry was unable to\r\nobtain from any particular soil or from any particular climate, commerce\r\nundertook to bring from the country which produced it. This caused\r\nRabelais to say that the stomach was the father and master of industry.\r\n\r\nWe will rapidly glance over the alimentary matters which our forefathers\r\nobtained from the animal and vegetable kingdom, and then trace the\r\nprogress of culinary art, and examine the rules of feasts and such matters\r\nas belong to the epicurean customs of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAliments.\r\n\r\n\r\nBread.--The Gauls, who principally inhabited deep and thick forests, fed\r\non herbs and fruits, and particularly on acorns. It is even possible that\r\nthe veneration in which they held the oak had no other origin. This\r\nprimitive food continued in use, at least in times of famine, up to the\r\neighth century, and we find in the regulations of St. Chrodegand that if,\r\nin consequence of a bad year, the acorn or beech-nut became scarce, it was\r\nthe bishop's duty to provide something to make up for it. Eight centuries\r\nlater, when René du Bellay, Bishop of Mans, came to report to Francis I.\r\nthe fearful poverty of his diocese, he informed the king that the\r\ninhabitants in many places were reduced to subsisting on acorn bread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 72 and 73.--Corn-threshing and\r\nBread-making.--Miniatures from the Calendar of a Book of\r\nHours.--Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times bread was cooked under the embers. The use of ovens\r\nwas introduced into Europe by the Romans, who had found them in Egypt.\r\nBut, notwithstanding this importation, the old system of cooking was long\r\nafter employed, for in the tenth century Raimbold, abbot of the monastery\r\nof St. Thierry, near Rheims, ordered in his will that on the day of his\r\ndeath bread cooked under the embers--_panes subcinericios_--should be\r\ngiven to his monks. By feudal law the lord was bound to bake the bread of\r\nhis vassals, for which they were taxed, but the latter often preferred to\r\ncook their flour at home in the embers of their own hearths, rather than\r\nto carry it to the public oven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--The Miller.--From an Engraving of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nIt must be stated that the custom of leavening the dough by the addition\r\nof a ferment was not universally adopted amongst the ancients. For this\r\nreason, as the dough without leaven could only produce a heavy and\r\nindigestible bread, they were careful, in order to secure their loaves\r\nbeing thoroughly cooked, to make them very thin. These loaves served as\r\nplates for cutting up the other food upon, and when they thus became\r\nsaturated with the sauce and gravy they were eaten as cakes. The use of\r\nthe _tourteaux_ (small crusty loaves), which were at first called\r\n_tranchoirs_ and subsequently _tailloirs_, remained long in fashion even\r\nat the most splendid banquets. Thus, in 1336, the Dauphin of Vienna,\r\nHumbert II., had, besides the small white bread, four small loaves to\r\nserve as _tranchoirs_ at table. The \"Ménagier de Paris\" mentions \"_des\r\npains de tranchouers_ half a foot in diameter, and four fingers deep,\" and\r\nFroissart the historian also speaks of _tailloirs_.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to point out the exact period at which leavening\r\nbread was adopted in Europe, but we can assert that in the Middle Ages it\r\nwas anything but general. Yeast, which, according to Pliny, was already\r\nknown to the Gauls, was reserved for pastry, and it was only at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century that the bakers of Paris used it for bread.\r\n\r\nAt first the trades of miller and baker were carried on by the same person\r\n(Figs. 74 and 75). The man who undertook the grinding of the grain had\r\novens near his mill, which he let to his lord to bake bread, when he did\r\nnot confine his business to persons who sent him their corn to grind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--The Baker.--From an Engraving of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nAt a later period public bakers established themselves, who not only baked\r\nthe loaves which were brought to them already kneaded, but also made bread\r\nwhich they sold by weight; and this system was in existence until very\r\nrecently in the provinces.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, in his \"Capitulaires\" (statutes), fixed the number of bakers\r\nin each city according to the population, and St. Louis relieved them, as\r\nwell as the millers, from taking their turn at the watch, so that they\r\nmight have no pretext for stopping or neglecting their work, which he\r\nconsidered of public utility. Nevertheless bakers as a body never became\r\nrich or powerful (Figs. 76 and 77). It is pretty generally believed that\r\nthe name of _boulanger_ (baker) originated from the fact that the shape\r\nof the loaves made at one time was very like that of a round ball. But\r\nloaves varied so much in form, quality, and consequently in name, that in\r\nhis \"Dictionary of Obscure Words\" the learned Du Cange specifies at least\r\ntwenty sorts made during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and amongst\r\nthem may be mentioned the court loaf, the pope's loaf, the knight's loaf,\r\nthe squire's loaf, the peer's loaf, the varlet's loaf, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Banner of the Corporation of Bakers of Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Banner of the Corporation, of Bakers of Arras.]\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated bread was the white bread of Chailly or Chilly, a\r\nvillage four leagues (ten miles) south of Paris, which necessarily\r\nappeared at all the tables of the _élite_ of the fourteenth century. The\r\n_pain mollet_, or soft bread made with milk and butter, although much in\r\nuse before this, only became fashionable on the arrival of Marie de\r\nMedicis in France (1600), on account of this Tuscan princess finding it so\r\nmuch to her taste that she would eat no other.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary market bread of Paris comprised the _rousset bread_, made of\r\nmeslin, and employed for soup; the _bourgeoisie bread_; and the _chaland_\r\nor _customer's bread_, which last was a general name given to all\r\ndescriptions which were sent daily from the neighbouring villages to the\r\ncapital. Amongst the best known varieties we will only mention the\r\n_Corbeil bread_, the _dog bread_, the _bread of two colours_, which last\r\nwas composed of alternate layers of wheat and rye, and was used by persons\r\nof small means; there was also the _Gonesse bread_, which has maintained\r\nits reputation to this day.\r\n\r\nThe \"table loaves,\" which in the provinces were served at the tables of\r\nthe rich, were of such a convenient size that one of them would suffice\r\nfor a man of ordinary appetite, even after the crust was cut off, which it\r\nwas considered polite to offer to the ladies, who soaked it in their soup.\r\nFor the servants an inferior bread was baked, called \"common bread.\"\r\n\r\nIn many counties they sprinkled the bread, before putting it into the\r\noven, with powdered linseed, a custom which still exists. They usually\r\nadded salt to the flour, excepting in certain localities, especially in\r\nParis, where, on account of its price, they only mixed it with the\r\nexpensive qualities.\r\n\r\nThe wheats which were long most esteemed for baking purposes, were those\r\nof Brie, Champagne, and Bassigny; while those of the Dauphiné were held of\r\nlittle value, because they were said to contain so many tares and\r\nworthless grains, that the bread made from them produced headache and\r\nother ailments.\r\n\r\nAn ancient chronicle of the time of Charlemagne makes mention of a bread\r\ntwice baked, or biscuit. This bread was very hard, and easier to keep than\r\nany other description. It was also used, as now, for provisioning ships,\r\nor towns threatened with a siege, as well as in religious houses. At a\r\nlater period, delicate biscuits were made of a sort of dry and crumbling\r\npastry which retained the original name. As early as the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Rheims had earned a great renown for these articles of food.\r\n\r\nBread made with barley, oats, or millet was always ranked as coarse food,\r\nto which the poor only had recourse in years of want (Fig. 78). Barley\r\nbread was, besides, used as a kind of punishment, and monks who had\r\ncommitted any serious offence against discipline were condemned to live on\r\nit for a certain period.\r\n\r\nRye bread was held of very little value, although in certain provinces,\r\nsuch as Lyonnais, Forez, and Auvergne, it was very generally used among\r\nthe country people, and contributed, says Bruyérin Champier in his\r\ntreatise \"De re Cibaria,\" to \"preserve beauty and freshness amongst\r\nwomen.\" At a later period, the doctors of Paris frequently ordered the use\r\nof bread made half of wheat and half of rye as a means \"of preserving the\r\nhealth.\" Black wheat, or buck wheat, which was introduced into Europe by\r\nthe Moors and Saracens when they conquered Spain, quickly spread to the\r\nnorthern provinces, especially to Flanders, where, by its easy culture and\r\nalmost certain yield, it averted much suffering from the inhabitants, who\r\nwere continually being threatened with famine.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that maize, or Turkey wheat, was cultivated in the\r\nsouth, and that rice came into use; but these two kinds of grain, both\r\nequally useless for bread, were employed the one for fattening poultry,\r\nand the other for making cakes, which, however, were little appreciated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Cultivation of Grain in use amongst the Peasants,\r\nand the Manufacture of Barley and Oat Bread.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\nan edition of Virgil published at Lyons in 1517.]\r\n\r\nVegetables and Plants Used in Cooking.--From the most ancient historical\r\ndocuments we find that at the very earliest period of the French monarchy,\r\nfresh and dried vegetables were the ordinary food of the population. Pliny\r\nand Columella attribute a Gallic origin to certain roots, and among them\r\nonions and parsnips, which the Romans cultivated in their gardens for use\r\nat their tables.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that vegetables were never considered as being\r\ncapable of forming solid nutriment, since they were almost exclusively\r\nused by monastic communities when under vows of extreme abstinence.\r\n\r\nA statute of Charlemagne, in which the useful plants which the emperor\r\ndesired should be cultivated in his domains are detailed, shows us that at\r\nthat period the greater part of our cooking vegetables were in use, for we\r\nfind mentioned in it, fennel, garlic, parsley, shallot, onions,\r\nwatercress, endive, lettuce, beetroot, cabbage, leeks, carrots,\r\nartichokes; besides long-beans, broad-beans, peas or Italian vetches, and\r\nlentils.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, the plants fit for cooking went under the\r\ngeneral appellation of _aigrun_, and amongst them, at a later date, were\r\nranked oranges, lemons, and other acid fruits. St. Louis added to this\r\ncategory even fruits with hard rinds, such as walnuts, filberts, and\r\nchestnuts; and when the guild of the fruiterers of Paris received its\r\nstatutes in 1608, they were still called \"vendors of fruits and _aigrun_.\"\r\n\r\nThe vegetables and cooking-plants noticed in the \"Ménagier de Paris,\"\r\nwhich dates from the fourteenth century, and in the treatise \"De\r\nObsoniis,\" of Platina (the name adopted by the Italian Bartholomew\r\nSacchi), which dates from the fifteenth century, do not lead us to suppose\r\nthat alimentary horticulture had made much progress since the time of\r\nCharlemagne. Moreover, we are astonished to find the thistle placed\r\namongst choice dishes; though it cannot be the common thistle that is\r\nmeant, but probably this somewhat general appellation refers to the\r\nvegetable-marrow, which is still found on the tables of the higher\r\nclasses, or perhaps the artichoke, which we know to be only a kind of\r\nthistle developed by cultivation, and which at that period had been\r\nrecently imported.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date melons begin to appear; but the management of this\r\nvegetable fruit was not much known. It was so imperfectly cultivated in\r\nthe northern provinces, that, in the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\nBruyérin Champier speaks of the Languedocians as alone knowing how to\r\nproduce excellent _sucrins_--\"thus called,\" say both Charles Estienne and\r\nLiébault in the \"Maison Rustique,\" \"because gardeners watered them with\r\nhoneyed or sweetened water.\" The water-melons have never been cultivated\r\nbut in the south.\r\n\r\nCabbages, the alimentary reputation of which dates from the remotest\r\ntimes, were already of several kinds, most of which have descended to us;\r\namongst them may be mentioned the apple-headed, the Roman, the white, the\r\ncommon white head, the Easter cabbage, &c.; but the one held in the\r\nhighest estimation was the famous cabbage of Senlis, whose leaves, says an\r\nancient author, when opened, exhaled a smell more agreeable than musk or\r\namber. This species no doubt fell into disuse when the plan of employing\r\naromatic herbs in cooking, which was so much in repute by our ancestors,\r\nwas abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Coat-of-arms of the Grain-measurers of Ghent, on\r\ntheir Ceremonial Banner, dated 1568.]\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence, at the same period as marjoram, carraway seed,\r\nsweet basil, coriander, lavender, and rosemary were used to add their\r\npungent flavour to sauces and hashes, on the same tables might be found\r\nherbs of the coldest and most insipid kinds, such as mallows, some kinds\r\nof mosses, &c.\r\n\r\nCucumber, though rather in request, was supposed to be an unwholesome\r\nvegetable, because it was said that the inhabitants of Forez, who ate much\r\nof it, were subject to periodical fevers, which might really have been\r\ncaused by noxious emanation from the ponds with which that country\r\nabounded. Lentils, now considered so wholesome, were also long looked upon\r\nas a doubtful vegetable; according to Liébault, they were difficult to\r\ndigest and otherwise injurious; they inflamed the inside, affected the\r\nsight, and brought on the nightmare, &c. On the other hand, small fresh\r\nbeans, especially those sold at Landit fair, were used in the most\r\ndelicate repasts; peas passed as a royal dish in the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen the custom was to eat them with salt pork.\r\n\r\nTurnips were also most esteemed by the Parisians. \"This vegetable is to\r\nthem,\" says Charles Estienne, \"what large radishes are to the Limousins.\"\r\nThe best were supposed to come from Maisons, Vaugirard, and Aubervilliers.\r\nLastly, there were four kinds of lettuces grown in France, according to\r\nLiébault, in 1574: the small, the common, the curled, and the Roman: the\r\nseed of the last-named was sent to France by François Rabelais when he was\r\nin Rome with Cardinal du Bellay in 1537; and the salad made from it\r\nconsequently received the name of Roman salad, which it has ever since\r\nretained. In fact, our ancestors much appreciated salads, for there was\r\nnot a banquet without at least three or four different kinds.\r\n\r\nFruits.--Western Europe was originally very poor in fruits, and it only\r\nimproved by foreign importations, mostly from Asia by the Romans. The\r\napricot came from Armenia, the pistachio-nuts and plums from Syria, the\r\npeach and nut from Persia, the cherry from Cerasus, the lemon from Media,\r\nthe filbert from the Hellespont, and chestnuts from Castana, a town of\r\nMagnesia. We are also indebted to Asia for almonds; the pomegranate,\r\naccording to some, came from Africa, to others from Cyprus; the quince\r\nfrom Cydon in Crete; the olive, fig, pear, and apple, from Greece.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Charlemagne show us that almost all these fruits were\r\nreared in his gardens, and that some of them were of several kinds or\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nA considerable period, however, elapsed before the finest and more\r\nluscious productions of the garden became as it were almost forced on\r\nnature by artificial means. Thus in the sixteenth century we find\r\nRabelais, Charles Estienne, and La Framboisière, physician to Henry IV.,\r\npraising the Corbeil peach, which was only an inferior and almost wild\r\nsort, and describing it as having \"_dry_ and _solid_ flesh, not adhering\r\nto the stone.\" The culture of this fruit, which was not larger than a\r\ndamask plum, had then, according to Champier, only just been introduced\r\ninto France. It must be remarked here that Jacques Coythier, physician to\r\nLouis XI., in order to curry favour with his master, who was very fond of\r\nnew fruits, took as his crest an apricot-tree, from which he was jokingly\r\ncalled Abri-Coythier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Cultivation of Fruit, from a Miniature of the\r\n\"Propriétaire de Choses\" (Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the\r\nLibrary of the Arsenal of Paris).]\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that great progress has been made in the culture of the\r\nplum, the pear, and the apple. Champier says that the best plums are the\r\n_royale_, the _perdrigon_, and the _damas_ of Tours; Olivier de Serres\r\nmentions eighteen kinds--amongst which, however, we do not find the\r\ncelebrated Reine Claude (greengage), which owes its name to the daughter\r\nof Louis XII., first wife of Francis I.\r\n\r\nOf pears, the most esteemed in the thirteenth century were the\r\n_hastiveau_, which was an early sort, and no doubt the golden pear now\r\ncalled St. Jean, the _caillou_ or _chaillou_, a hard pear, which came from\r\nCailloux in Burgundy and _l'angoisse_ (agony), so called on account of its\r\nbitterness--which, however, totally disappeared in cooking. In the\r\nsixteenth century the palm is given to the _cuisse dame_, or _madame_; the\r\n_bon chrétien_, brought, it is said, by St. François de Paule to Louis\r\nXI.; the _bergamote_, which came from Bergamo, in Lombardy; the\r\n_tant-bonne_, so named from its aroma; and the _caillou rosat_, our\r\nrosewater pear.\r\n\r\nAmongst apples, the _blandureau_ (hard white) of Auvergne, the _rouveau_,\r\nand the _paradis_ of Provence, are of oldest repute. This reminds us of\r\nthe couplet by the author of the \"Street Cries of Paris,\" thirteenth\r\ncentury:--\r\n\r\n  \"Primes ai pommes de rouviau,\r\n  Et d'Auvergne le blanc duriau.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Give me first the russet apple,\r\n  And the hard white fruit of Auvergne.\")\r\n\r\nThe quince, which was so generally cultivated in the Middle Ages, was\r\nlooked upon as the most useful of all fruits. Not only did it form the\r\nbasis of the farmers' dried preserves of Orleans, called _cotignac_, a\r\nsort of marmalade, but it was also used for seasoning meat. The Portugal\r\nquince was the most esteemed; and the cotignac of Orleans had such a\r\nreputation, that boxes of this fruit were always given to kings, queens,\r\nand princes on entering the towns of France. It was the first offering\r\nmade to Joan of Arc on her bringing reinforcements into Orleans during the\r\nEnglish siege.\r\n\r\nSeveral sorts of cherries were known, but these did not prevent the small\r\nwild or wood cherry from being appreciated at the tables of the citizens;\r\nwhilst the _cornouille_, or wild cornelian cherry, was hardly touched,\r\nexcepting by the peasants; thence came the proverbial expression, more\r\nparticularly in use at Orleans, when a person made a silly remark, \"He has\r\neaten cornelians,\" _i.e._, he speaks like a rustic.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, chestnuts from Lombardy were hawked in the\r\nstreets; but, in the sixteenth century, the chestnuts of the Lyonnais and\r\nAuvergne were substituted, and were to be found on the royal table. Four\r\ndifferent sorts of figs, in equal estimation, were brought from\r\nMarseilles, Nismes, Saint-Andéol, and Pont Saint-Esprit; and in Provence,\r\nfilberts were to be had in such profusion that they supplied from there\r\nall the tables of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese claim the honour of having introduced oranges from China;\r\nhowever, in an account of the house of Humbert, Dauphin of Viennois, in\r\n1333, that is, long before the expeditions of the Portuguese to India,\r\nmention is made of a sum of money being paid for transplanting\r\norange-trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 81 and 82.--Culture of the Vine and Treading the\r\nGrape.--Miniatures taken from the Calendar of a Prayer-Book, in\r\nManuscript, of the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Bruyérin Champier, physician to Henry II., raspberries were\r\nstill completely wild; the same author states that wood strawberries had\r\nonly just at that time been introduced into gardens, \"by which,\" he says,\r\n\"they had attained a larger size, though they at the same time lost their\r\nquality.\"\r\n\r\nThe vine, acclimatised and propagated by the Gauls, ever since the\r\nfollowers of Brennus had brought it from Italy, five hundred years before\r\nthe Christian era, never ceased to be productive, and even to constitute\r\nthe natural wealth of the country (Fig. 81 and 82). In the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Liébault enumerated nineteen sorts of grapes, and Olivier de\r\nSerres twenty-four, amongst which, notwithstanding the eccentricities of\r\nthe ancient names, we believe that we can trace the greater part of those\r\nplants which are now cultivated in France. For instance, it is known that\r\nthe excellent vines of Thomery, near Fontainebleau, which yield in\r\nabundance the most beautiful table grape which art and care can produce,\r\nwere already in use in the reign of Henry IV. (Fig. 83).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--The Winegrower, drawn and engraved in the\r\nSixteenth Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Gauls the custom of drying grapes by exposing them to\r\nthe sun, or to a certain amount of artificial heat, was already known; and\r\nvery soon after, the same means were adopted for preserving plums, an\r\nindustry in which then, as now, the people of Tours and Rheims excelled.\r\nDrying apples in an oven was also the custom, and formed a delicacy which\r\nwas reserved for winter and spring banquets. Dried fruits were also\r\nbrought from abroad, as mentioned in the \"Book of Street Cries in\r\nParis:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"Figues de Mélités sans fin,\r\n  J'ai roisin d'outre mer, roisin.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Figs from Malta without end,\r\n  And grapes from over the sea.\")\r\n\r\nButchers' Meat.--According to Strabo, the Gauls were great eaters of meat,\r\nespecially of pork, whether fresh or salted. \"Gaul,\" says he, \"feeds so\r\nmany flocks, and, above all, so many pigs, that it supplies not only Rome,\r\nbut all Italy, with grease and salt meat.\" The second chapter of the Salic\r\nlaw, comprising nineteen articles, relates entirely to penalties for\r\npig-stealing; and in the laws of the Visigoths we find four articles on\r\nthe same subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Swineherd.\r\n\r\nIllustration: Fig 85.--A Burgess at Meals.\r\n\r\nMiniatures from the Calendar of a Book of Hours.--Manuscript of the\r\nSixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nIn those remote days, in which the land was still covered with enormous\r\nforests of oak, great facilities were offered for breeding pigs, whose\r\nspecial liking for acorns is well known. Thus the bishops, princes, and\r\nlords caused numerous droves of pigs to be fed on their domains, both for\r\nthe purpose of supplying their own tables as well as for the fairs and\r\nmarkets. At a subsequent period, it became the custom for each household,\r\nwhether in town or country, to rear and fatten a pig, which was killed and\r\nsalted at a stated period of the year; and this custom still exists in\r\nmany provinces. In Paris, for instance, there was scarcely a bourgeois who\r\nhad not two or three young pigs. During the day these unsightly creatures\r\nwere allowed to roam in the streets; which, however, they helped to keep\r\nclean by eating up the refuse of all sorts which was thrown out of the\r\nhouses. One of the sons of Louis le Gros, while passing, on the 2nd of\r\nOctober, 1131, in the Rue du Martroi, between the Hôtel de Ville and the\r\nchurch of St. Gervais, fractured his skull by a fall from his horse,\r\ncaused by a pig running between that animal's legs. This accident led to\r\nthe first order being issued by the provosts, to the effect that breeding\r\npigs within the town was forbidden. Custom, however, deep-rooted for\r\ncenturies, resisted this order, and many others on the same subject which\r\nfollowed it: for we find, under Francis I., a license was issued to the\r\nexecutioner, empowering him to capture all the stray pigs which he could\r\nfind in Paris, and to take them to the Hôtel Dieu, when he should receive\r\neither five sous in silver or the head of the animal.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the holy men of St. Antoine, in virtue of the privilege\r\nattached to the popular legend of their patron, who was generally\r\nrepresented with a pig, objected to this order, and long after maintained\r\nthe exclusive right of allowing their pigs to roam in the streets of the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe obstinate determination with which every one tried to evade the\r\nadministrative laws on this subject, is explained, in fact, by the general\r\ntaste of the French nation for pork. This taste appears somewhat strange\r\nat a time when this kind of food was supposed to engender leprosy, a\r\ndisease with which France was at that time overrun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Stall of Carved Wood (Fifteenth Century),\r\nrepresenting the Proverb, \"Margaritas ante Porcos,\" \"Throwing Pearls\r\nbefore Swine,\" from Rouen Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nPigs' meat made up generally the greater part of the domestic banquets.\r\nThere was no great feast at which hams, sausages, and black puddings were\r\nnot served in profusion on all the tables; and as Easter Day, which\r\nbrought to a close the prolonged fastings of Lent, was one of the great\r\nfeasts, this food formed the most important dish on that occasion. It is\r\npossible that the necessity for providing for the consumption of that day\r\noriginated the celebrated ham fair, which was and is still held annually\r\non the Thursday of Passion Week in front of Notre-Dame, where the dealers\r\nfrom all parts of France, and especially from Normandy and Lower\r\nBrittany, assembled with their swine.\r\n\r\nSanitary measures were taken in Paris and in the various towns in order to\r\nprevent the evil effects likely to arise from the enormous consumption of\r\npork; public officers, called _languayeurs_, were ordered to examine the\r\nanimals to ensure that they had not white ulcers under the tongue, these\r\nbeing considered the signs that their flesh was in a condition to\r\ncommunicate leprosy to those who partook of it.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the retail sale of pork was confined to the butchers, like\r\nthat of other meat. Salt or fresh pork was at one time always sold raw,\r\nthough at a later period some retailers, who carried on business\r\nprincipally among the lowest orders of the people, took to selling cooked\r\npork and sausages. They were named _charcuitiers_ or _saucissiers_. This\r\nnew trade, which was most lucrative, was adopted by so many people that\r\nparliament was forced to limit the number of _charcuitiers_, who at last\r\nformed a corporation, and received their statutes, which were confirmed by\r\nthe King in 1475.\r\n\r\nAmongst the privileges attached to their calling was that of selling red\r\nherrings and sea-fish in Lent, during which time the sale of pork was\r\nstrictly forbidden. Although they had the exclusive monopoly of selling\r\ncooked pork, they were at first forbidden to buy their meat of any one but\r\nof the butchers, who alone had the right of killing pigs; and it was only\r\nin 1513 that the _charcuitiers_ were allowed to purchase at market and\r\nsell the meat raw, in opposition to the butchers, who in consequence\r\ngradually gave up killing and selling pork (Fig. 87).\r\n\r\nAlthough the consumption of butchers' meat was not so great in the Middle\r\nAges as it is now, the trade of a butcher, to which extraordinary\r\nprivileges were attached, was nevertheless one of the industries which\r\nrealised the greatest profits.\r\n\r\nWe know what an important part the butchers played in the municipal\r\nhistory of France, as also of Belgium; and we also know how great their\r\npolitical influence was, especially in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--The Pork-butcher (_Charcutier_).--Fac-simile of\r\na Miniature in a Charter of the Abbey of Solignac (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nThe existence of the great slaughter-house of Paris dates back to the most\r\nremote period of monarchy. The parish church of the corporation of\r\nbutchers, namely, that of St. Pierre aux Boeufs in the city, on the front\r\nof which were two sculptured oxen, existed before the tenth century. A\r\nCeltic monument was discovered on the site of the ancient part of Paris,\r\nwith a bas-relief representing a wild bull carrying three cranes standing\r\namong oak branches. Archæology has chosen to recognise in this sculpture a\r\nDruidical allegory, which has descended to us in the shape of the\r\ntriumphal car of the Prize Ox (Fig. 88). The butchers who, for centuries\r\nat least in France, only killed sheep and pigs, proved themselves most\r\njealous of their privileges, and admitted no strangers into their\r\ncorporation. The proprietorship of stalls at the markets, and the right of\r\nbeing admitted as a master butcher at the age of seven years and a day,\r\nbelonged exclusively to the male descendants of a few rich and powerful\r\nfamilies. The Kings of France alone, on their accession, could create a\r\nnew master butcher. Since the middle of the fourteenth century the \"Grande\r\nBoucherie\" was the seat of an important jurisdiction, composed of a mayor,\r\na master, a proctor, and an attorney; it also had a judicial council\r\nbefore which the butchers could bring up all their cases, and an appeal\r\nfrom which could only be considered by Parliament. Besides this court,\r\nwhich had to decide cases of misbehaviour on the part of the apprentices,\r\nand all their appeals against their masters, the corporation had a counsel\r\nin Parliament, as also one at the Châtelet, who were specially attached to\r\nthe interests of the butchers, and were in their pay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--The Holy Ox.--Celtic Monument found in Paris\r\nunder the Choir of Notre-Dame in 1711, and preserved in the Musée de Cluny\r\net des Thermes.]\r\n\r\nAlthough bound, at all events with their money, to follow the calling of\r\ntheir fathers, we find many descendants of ancient butchers' families of\r\nParis, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, abandoning their stalls\r\nto fill high places in the state, and even at court. It must not be\r\nconcluded that the rich butchers in those days occupied themselves with\r\nthe minor details of their trade; the greater number employed servants who\r\ncut up and retailed the meat, and they themselves simply kept the\r\naccounts, and were engaged in dealing through factors or foremen for the\r\npurchase of beasts for their stalls (Fig. 89). One can form an opinion of\r\nthe wealth of some of these tradesmen by reading the enumeration made by\r\nan old chronicler of the property and income of Guillaume de Saint-Yon,\r\none of the principal master butchers in 1370. \"He was proprietor of three\r\nstalls, in which meat was weekly sold to the amount of 200 _livres\r\nparisis_ (the livre being equivalent to 24 francs at least), with an\r\naverage profit of ten to fifteen per cent.; he had an income of 600\r\n_livres parisis_; he possessed besides his family house in Paris, four\r\ncountry-houses, well supplied with furniture and agricultural implements,\r\ndrinking-cups, vases, cups of silver, and cups of onyx with silver feet,\r\nvalued at 100 francs or more each. His wife had jewels, belts, purses, and\r\ntrinkets, to the value of upwards of 1,000 gold francs (the gold franc was\r\nworth 24 livres); long and short gowns trimmed with fur; and three mantles\r\nof grey fur. Guillaume de Saint-Yon had generally in his storehouses 300\r\nox-hides, worth 24 francs each at least; 800 measures of fat, worth 3-1/2\r\nsols each; in his sheds, he had 800 sheep worth 100 sols each; in his\r\nsafes 500 or 600 silver florins of ready money (the florin was worth 12\r\nfrancs, which must be multiplied five times to estimate its value in\r\npresent currency), and his household furniture was valued at 12,000\r\nflorins. He gave a dowry of 2,000 florins to his two nieces, and spent\r\n3,000 florins in rebuilding his Paris house; and lastly, as if he had been\r\na noble, he used a silver seal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--The Butcher and his Servant, drawn and engraved\r\nby J. Amman (Sixteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nWe find in the \"Ménagier de Paris\" curious statistics respecting the\r\nvarious butchers' shops of the capital, and the daily sale in each at the\r\nperiod referred to. This sale, without counting the households of the\r\nKing, the Queen, and the royal family, which were specially provisioned,\r\namounted to 26,624 oxen, 162,760 sheep, 27,456 pigs, and 15,912 calves\r\nper annum; to which must be added not only the smoked and salted flesh of\r\n200 or 300 pigs, which were sold at the fair in Holy Week, but also 6,420\r\nsheep, 823 oxen, 832 calves, and 624 pigs, which, according to the\r\n\"Ménagier,\" were used in the royal and princely households.\r\n\r\nSometimes the meat was sent to market already cut up, but the slaughter of\r\nbeasts was more frequently done in the butchers' shops in the town; for\r\nthey only killed from day to day, according to the demand. Besides the\r\nbutchers' there were tripe shops, where the feet, kidneys, &c., were sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 90 and 91.--Seal and Counter-Seal of the Butchers of\r\nBruges in 1356, from an impression on green wax, preserved in the archives\r\nof that town.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Bruyérin Champier, during the sixteenth century the most\r\ncelebrated sheep in France were those of Berri and Limousin; and of all\r\nbutchers' meat, veal was reckoned the best. In fact, calves intended for\r\nthe tables of the upper classes were fed in a special manner: they were\r\nallowed for six months, or even for a year, nothing but milk, which made\r\ntheir flesh most tender and delicate. Contrary to the present taste, kid\r\nwas more appreciated than lamb, which caused the _rôtisseurs_ frequently\r\nto attach the tail of a kid to a lamb, so as to deceive the customer and\r\nsell him a less expensive meat at the higher price. This was the origin of\r\nthe proverb which described a cheat as \"a dealer in goat by halves.\"\r\n\r\nIn other places butchers were far from acquiring the same importance which\r\nthey did in France and Belgium (Figs. 90 and 91), where much more meat was\r\nconsumed than in Spain, Italy, or even in Germany. Nevertheless, in\r\nalmost all countries there were certain regulations, sometimes eccentric,\r\nbut almost always rigidly enforced, to ensure a supply of meat of the best\r\nquality and in a healthy state. In England, for instance, butchers were\r\nonly allowed to kill bulls after they had been baited with dogs, no doubt\r\nwith the view of making the flesh more tender. At Mans, it was laid down\r\nin the trade regulations, that \"no butcher shall be so bold as to sell\r\nmeat unless it shall have been previously seen alive by two or three\r\npersons, who will testify to it on oath; and, anyhow, they shall not sell\r\nit until the persons shall have declared it wholesome,\" &c.\r\n\r\nTo the many regulations affecting the interests of the public must be\r\nadded that forbidding butchers to sell meat on days when abstinence from\r\nanimal food was ordered by the Church. These regulations applied less to\r\nthe vendors than to the consumers, who, by disobeying them, were liable to\r\nfine or imprisonment, or to severe corporal punishment by the whip or in\r\nthe pillory. We find that Clément Marot was imprisoned and nearly burned\r\nalive for having eaten pork in Lent. In 1534, Guillaume des Moulins, Count\r\nof Brie, asked permission for his mother, who was then eighty years of\r\nage, to cease fasting; the Bishop of Paris only granted dispensation on\r\ncondition that the old lady should take her meals in secret and out of\r\nsight of every one, and should still fast on Fridays. \"In a certain town,\"\r\nsays Brantôme, \"there had been a procession in Lent. A woman, who had\r\nassisted at it barefooted, went home to dine off a quarter of lamb and a\r\nham. The smell got into the street; the house was entered. The fact being\r\nestablished, the woman was taken, and condemned to walk through the town\r\nwith her quarter of lamb on the spit over her shoulder, and the ham hung\r\nround her neck.\" This species of severity increased during the times of\r\nreligious dissensions. Erasmus says, \"He who has eaten pork instead of\r\nfish is taken to the torture like a parricide.\" An edict of Henry II,\r\n1549, forbade the sale of meat in Lent to persons who should not be\r\nfurnished with a doctor's certificate. Charles IX forbade the sale of meat\r\nto the Huguenots; and it was ordered that the privilege of selling meat\r\nduring the time of abstinence should belong exclusively to the hospitals.\r\nOrders were given to those who retailed meat to take the address of every\r\npurchaser, although he had presented a medical certificate, so that the\r\nnecessity for his eating meat might be verified. Subsequently, the medical\r\ncertificate required to be endorsed by the priest, specifying what\r\nquantity of meat was required. Even in these cases the use of butchers'\r\nmeat alone was granted, pork, poultry, and game being strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nPoultry.--A monk of the Abbey of Cluny once went on a visit to his\r\nrelations. On arriving he asked for food; but as it was a fast day he was\r\ntold there was nothing in the house but fish. Perceiving some chickens in\r\nthe yard, he took a stick and killed one, and brought it to his relations,\r\nsaying, \"This is the fish which I shall eat to-day.\" \"Eh, but, my son,\"\r\nthey said, \"have you dispensation from fasting on a Friday?\" \"No,\" he\r\nanswered; \"but poultry is not flesh; fish and fowls were created at the\r\nsame time; they have a common origin, as the hymn which I sing in the\r\nservice teaches me.\"\r\n\r\nThis simple legend belongs to the tenth century; and notwithstanding that\r\nthe opinion of this Benedictine monk may appear strange nowadays, yet it\r\nmust be acknowledged that he was only conforming himself to the opinions\r\nlaid down by certain theologians. In 817, the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle\r\ndecided that such delicate nourishment could scarcely be called\r\nmortification as understood by the teaching of the Church. In consequence\r\nof this an order was issued forbidding the monks to eat poultry, except\r\nduring four days at Easter and four at Christmas. But this prohibition in\r\nno way changed the established custom of certain parts of Christendom, and\r\nthe faithful persisted in believing that poultry and fish were identical\r\nin the eyes of the Church, and accordingly continued to eat them\r\nindiscriminately. We also see, in the middle of the thirteenth century,\r\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, who was considered an authority in questions of dogma\r\nand of faith, ranking poultry amongst species of aquatic origin.\r\n\r\nEventually, this palpable error was abandoned; but when the Church forbade\r\nChristians the use of poultry on fast days, it made an exception, out of\r\nconsideration for the ancient prejudice, in favour of teal, widgeon,\r\nmoor-hens, and also two or three kinds of small amphibious quadrupeds.\r\nHence probably arose the general and absurd beliefs concerning the origin\r\nof teal, which some said sprung from the rotten wood of old ships, others\r\nfrom the fruits of a tree, or the gum on fir-trees, whilst others thought\r\nthey came from a fresh-water shell analogous to that of the oyster and\r\nmussel.\r\n\r\nAs far back as modern history can be traced, we find that a similar mode\r\nof fattening poultry was employed then as now, and was one which the Gauls\r\nmust have learnt from the Romans. Amongst the charges in the households\r\nof the kings of France one item was that which concerned the\r\npoultry-house, and which, according to an edict of St. Louis in 1261,\r\nbears the name of _poulaillier_. At a subsequent period this name was\r\ngiven to breeders and dealers in poultry (Fig. 92).\r\n\r\nThe \"Ménagier\" tells as that, as is the present practice, chickens were\r\nfattened by depriving them of light and liberty, and gorging them with\r\nsucculent food. Amongst the poultry yards in repute at that time, the\r\nauthor mentions that of Hesdin, a property of the Dukes of Luxemburg, in\r\nArtois; that of the King, at the Hôtel Saint-Pol, Rue Saint-Antoine,\r\nParis; that of Master Hugues Aubriot, provost of Paris; and that of\r\nCharlot, no doubt a bourgeois of that name, who also gave his name to an\r\nancient street in that quarter called the Marais.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--The Poulterer, drawn and engraved in the\r\nSixteenth Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\n_Capons_ are frequently mentioned in poems of the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies; but the name of the _poularde_ does not occur until the\r\nsixteenth.\r\n\r\nWe know that under the Roman rule, the Gauls carried on a considerable\r\ntrade in fattened geese. This trade ceased when Gaul passed to new\r\nmasters; but the breeding of geese continued to be carefully attended to.\r\nFor many centuries geese were more highly prized than any other\r\ndescription of poultry, and Charlemagne ordered that his domains should\r\nbe well stocked with flocks of geese, which were driven to feed in the\r\nfields, like flocks of sheep. There was an old proverb, \"Who eats the\r\nking's goose returns the feathers in a hundred years.\" This bird was\r\nconsidered a great delicacy by the working classes and bourgeoisie. The\r\n_rôtisseurs_ (Fig. 94) had hardly anything in their shops but geese, and,\r\ntherefore, when they were united in a company, they received the name of\r\n_oyers_, or _oyeurs_. The street in which they were established, with\r\ntheir spits always loaded with juicy roasts, was called Rue des _Oues_\r\n(geese), and this street, when it ceased to be frequented by the _oyers_,\r\nbecame by corruption Rue Auxours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Barnacle Geese.--Fac-simile of an Engraving on\r\nWood, from the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster, folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nThere is every reason for believing that the domestication of the wild\r\nduck is of quite recent date. The attempt having succeeded, it was wished\r\nto follow it up by the naturalisation in the poultry-yard of two other\r\nsorts of aquatic birds, namely, the sheldrake (_tadorna_) and the moorhen,\r\nbut without success. Some attribute the introduction of turkeys into\r\nFrance and Europe to Jacques Coeur, treasurer to Charles VII., whose\r\ncommercial connections with the East were very extensive; others assert\r\nthat it is due to King René, Count of Provence; but according to the best\r\nauthorities these birds were first brought into France in the time of\r\nFrancis I. by Admiral Philippe de Chabot, and Bruyérin Champier asserts\r\nthat they were not known until even later. It was at about the same period\r\nthat guinea-fowls were brought from the coast of Africa by Portuguese\r\nmerchants; and the travelling naturalist, Pierre Belon, who wrote in the\r\nyear 1555, asserts that in his time \"they had already so multiplied in the\r\nhouses of the nobles that they had become quite common.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--The Poultry-dealer.--Fac-simile of an Engraving\r\non Wood, after Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\nThe pea-fowl played an important part in the chivalric banquets of the\r\nMiddle Ages (Fig. 95). According to old poets the flesh of this noble bird\r\nis \"food for the brave.\" A poet of the thirteenth century says, \"that\r\nthieves have as much taste for falsehood as a hungry man has for the flesh\r\nof the peacock.\" In the fourteenth century poultry-yards were still\r\nstocked with these birds; but the turkey and the pheasant gradually\r\nreplaced them, as their flesh was considered somewhat hard and stringy.\r\nThis is proved by the fact that in 1581, \"La Nouvelle Coutume du\r\nBourbonnois\" only reckons the value of these beautiful birds at two sous\r\nand a half, or about three francs of present currency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--State Banquet.--Serving the Peacock.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Woodcut in an edition of Virgil, folio, published at Lyons in 1517.]\r\n\r\nGame.--Our forefathers included among the birds which now constitute\r\nfeathered game the heron, the crane, the crow, the swan, the stork, the\r\ncormorant, and the bittern. These supplied the best tables, especially the\r\nfirst three, which were looked upon as exquisite food, fit even for\r\nroyalty, and were reckoned as thorough French delicacies. There were at\r\nthat time heronries, as at a later period there were pheasantries. People\r\nalso ate birds of prey, and only rejected those which fed on carrion.\r\n\r\nSwans, which were much appreciated, were very common on all the principal\r\nrivers of France, especially in the north; a small island below Paris had\r\ntaken its name from these birds, and has maintained it ever since. It was\r\nproverbially said that the Charente was bordered with swans, and for this\r\nsame reason Valenciennes was called _Val des Cygnes_, or the Swan Valley.\r\n\r\nSome authors make it appear that for a long time young game was avoided\r\nowing to the little nourishment it contained and its indigestibility, and\r\nassert that it was only when some French ambassadors returned from Venice\r\nthat the French learnt that young partridges and leverets were exquisite,\r\nand quite fit to appear at the most sumptuous banquets. The \"Ménagier\"\r\ngives not only various receipts for cooking them, but also for dressing\r\nchickens, when game was out of season, so as to make them taste like young\r\npartridges.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when they fattened pheasants as they did capons; it was a\r\nsecret, says Liébault, only known to the poultry dealers; but although\r\nthey were much appreciated, the pullet was more so, and realised as much\r\nas two crowns each (this does not mean the gold crown, but a current coin\r\nworth three livres). Plovers, which sometimes came from Beauce in\r\ncart-loads, were much relished; they were roasted without being drawn, as\r\nalso were turtle-doves and larks; \"for,\" says an ancient author, \"larks\r\nonly eat small pebbles and sand, doves grains of juniper and scented\r\nherbs, and plovers feed on air.\" At a later period the same honour was\r\nconferred on woodcocks.\r\n\r\nThrushes, starlings, blackbirds, quail, and partridges were in equal\r\nrepute according to the season. The _bec-figue_, a small bird like a\r\nnightingale, was so much esteemed in Provence that there were feasts at\r\nwhich that bird alone was served, prepared in various ways; but of all\r\nbirds used for the table none could be compared to the young cuckoo taken\r\njust as it was full fledged.\r\n\r\nAs far as we can ascertain, the Gauls had a dislike to the flesh of\r\nrabbits, and they did not even hunt them, for according to Strabo,\r\nSouthern Gaul was infested with these mischievous animals, which destroyed\r\nthe growing crops, and even the barks of the trees. There was considerable\r\nchange in this respect a few centuries later, for every one in town or\r\ncountry reared domesticated rabbits, and the wild ones formed an article\r\nof food which was much in request. In order to ascertain whether a rabbit\r\nis young, Strabo tells us we should feel the first joint of the fore-leg,\r\nwhen we shall find a small bone free and movable. This method is adopted\r\nin all kitchens in the present day. Hares were preferred to rabbits,\r\nprovided they were young; for an old French proverb says, \"An old hare and\r\nan old goose are food for the devil.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--\"The way to skin and cut up a Stag.\"--Fac-simile\r\nof a Miniature of \"Phoebus, and his Staff for hunting Wild Animals\"\r\n(Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe hedgehog and squirrel were also eaten. As for roe and red deer, they\r\nwere, according to Dr. Bruyérin Ohampier, morsels fit for kings and rich\r\npeople (Fig. 96). The doctor speaks of \"fried slices of the young horn of\r\nthe stag\" as the daintiest of food, and the \"Ménagier de Paris\" shows how,\r\nas early as the fourteenth century, beef was dished up like bear's-flesh\r\nvenison, for the use of kitchens in countries where the black bear did not\r\nexist. This proves that bear's flesh was in those days considered good\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nMilk, Butter, Eggs, and Cheese.--These articles of food, the first which\r\nnature gave to man, were not always and everywhere uniformly permitted or\r\nprohibited by the Church on fast days. The faithful were for several\r\ncenturies left to their own judgment on the subject. In fact, there is\r\nnothing extraordinary in eggs being eaten in Lent without scruple,\r\nconsidering that some theologians maintained that the hens which laid them\r\nwere animals of aquatic extraction.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that butter, either from prejudice or mere custom,\r\nwas only used on fast days in its fresh state, and was not allowed to be\r\nused for cooking purposes. At first, and especially amongst the monks, the\r\ndishes were prepared with oil; but as in some countries oil was apt to\r\nbecome very expensive, and the supply even to fail totally, animal fat or\r\nlard had to be substituted. At a subsequent period the Church authorised\r\nthe use of butter and milk; but on this point, the discipline varied much.\r\nIn the fourteenth century, Charles V., King of France, having asked Pope\r\nGregory XI. for a dispensation to use milk and butter on fast days, in\r\nconsequence of the bad state of his health, brought on owing to an attempt\r\nhaving been made to poison him, the supreme Pontiff required a certificate\r\nfrom a physician and from the King's confessor. He even then only granted\r\nthe dispensation after imposing on that Christian king the repetition of a\r\ncertain number of prayers and the performance of certain pious deeds. In\r\ndefiance of the severity of ecclesiastical authority, we find, in the\r\n\"Journal of a Bourgeois of Paris,\" that in the unhappy reign of Charles\r\nVI. (1420), \"for want of oil, butter was eaten in Lent the same as on\r\nordinary non-fast days.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1491, Queen Anne, Duchess of Brittany, in order to obtain permission\r\nfrom the Pope to eat butter in Lent, represented that Brittany did not\r\nproduce oil, neither did it import it from southern countries. Many\r\nnorthern provinces adopted necessity as the law, and, having no oil, used\r\nbutter; and thence originated that famous toast with slices of bread and\r\nbutter, which formed such an important part of Flemish food. These papal\r\ndispensations were, however, only earned at the price of prayers and alms,\r\nand this was the origin of the _troncs pour le beurre_, that is, \"alms-box\r\nfor butter,\" which are still to be seen in some of the Flemish churches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--The Manufacture of Oil, drawn and engraved by J.\r\nAmman in the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nIt is not known when butter was first salted in order to preserve it or to\r\nsend it to distant places; but this process, which is so simple and so\r\nnatural, dates, no doubt, from very ancient times; it was particularly\r\npractised by the Normans and Bretons, who enclosed the butter in large\r\nearthenware jars, for in the statutes which were given to the fruiterers\r\nof Paris in 1412, mention is made of salt butter in earthenware jars.\r\nLorraine only exported butter in such jars. The fresh butter most in\r\nrequest for the table in Paris, was that made at Vanvres, which in the\r\nmonth of May the people ate every morning mixed with garlic.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of butter was greatest in Flanders. \"I am surprised,\" says\r\nBruyérin Champier, speaking of that country, \"that they have not yet tried\r\nto turn it into drink; in France it is mockingly called _beurrière;_ and\r\nwhen any one has to travel in that country, he is advised to take a knife\r\nwith him if he wishes to taste the good rolls of butter.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--A Dealer in Eggs.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut, after\r\nCesare Vecellio, Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to state that milk and cheese followed the fortunes of\r\nbutter in the Catholic world, the same as eggs followed those of poultry.\r\nBut butter having been declared lawful by the Church, a claim was put in\r\nfor eggs (Fig. 98), and Pope Julius III. granted this dispensation to all\r\nChristendom, although certain private churches did not at once choose to\r\nprofit by this favour. The Greeks had always been more rigid on these\r\npoints of discipline than the people of the West. It is to the prohibition\r\nof eggs in Lent that the origin of \"Easter eggs\" must be traced. These\r\nwere hardened by boiling them in a madder bath, and were brought to\r\nreceive the blessing of the priest on Good Friday, and were then eaten on\r\nthe following Sunday as a sign of rejoicing.\r\n\r\nAncient Gaul was celebrated for some of its home-made cheeses. Pliny\r\npraises those of Nismes, and of Mount Lozère, in Gévaudau; Martial\r\nmentions those of Toulouse, &c. A simple anecdote, handed down by the monk\r\nof St. Gall, who wrote in the ninth century, proves to us that the\r\ntraditions with regard to cheeses were not lost in the time of\r\nCharlemagne: \"The Emperor, in one of his travels, alighted suddenly, and\r\nwithout being expected, at the house of a bishop. It was on a Friday. The\r\nprelate had no fish, and did not dare to set meat before the prince. He\r\ntherefore offered him what he had got, some boiled corn and green cheese.\r\nCharles ate of the cheese; but taking the green part to be bad, he took\r\ncare to remove it with his knife. The Bishop, seeing this, took the\r\nliberty of telling his guest that this was the best part. The Emperor,\r\ntasting it, found that the bishop was right; and consequently ordered him\r\nto send him annually two cases of similar cheese to Aix-la-Chapelle. The\r\nBishop answered, that he could easily send cheeses, but he could not be\r\nsure of sending them in proper condition, because it was only by opening\r\nthem that you could be sure of the dealer not having deceived you in the\r\nquality of the cheese. 'Well,' said the Emperor, 'before sending them, cut\r\nthem through the middle, so as to see if they are what I want; you will\r\nonly have to join the two halves again by means of a wooden peg, and you\r\ncan then put the whole into a case.'\"\r\n\r\nUnder the kings of the third French dynasty, a cheese was made at the\r\nvillage of Chaillot, near Paris, which was much appreciated in the\r\ncapital. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the cheeses of Champagne\r\nand of Brie, which are still manufactured, were equally popular, and were\r\nhawked in the streets, according to the \"Book of Street-Cries in Paris,\"--\r\n\r\n  \"J'ai bon fromage de Champaigne;\r\n  Or i a fromage de Brie!\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Buy my cheese from Champagne,\r\n  And my cheese from Brie!\")\r\n\r\nEustache Deschamps went so far as to say that cheese was the only good\r\nthing which could possibly come from Brie.\r\n\r\nThe \"Ménagier de Paris\" praises several kinds of cheeses, the names of\r\nwhich it would now be difficult to trace, owing to their frequent changes\r\nduring four hundred years; but, according to the Gallic author of this\r\ncollection, a cheese to be presentable at table, was required to possess\r\ncertain qualities (in proverbial Latin, \"Non Argus, nee Helena, nee Maria\r\nMagdalena,\" &c.), thus expressed in French rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  \"Non mie (pas) blanc comme Hélaine,\r\n  Non mie (pas) plourant comme Magdelaine,\r\n  Non Argus (à cent yeux), mais du tout avugle (aveugle)\r\n  Et aussi pesant comme un bugle (boeuf),\r\n  Contre le pouce soit rebelle,\r\n  Et qu'il ait ligneuse cotelle (épaisse croûte)\r\n  Sans yeux, sans plourer, non pas blanc,\r\n  Tigneulx, rebelle, bien pesant.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Neither-white like Helena,\r\n  Nor weeping as Magdelena,\r\n  Neither Argus, nor yet quite blind,\r\n  And having too a thickish rind,\r\n  Resisting somewhat to the touch,\r\n  And as a bull should weigh as much;\r\n  Not eyeless, weeping, nor quite white,\r\n  But firm, resisting, not too light.\")\r\n\r\nIn 1509, Platina, although an Italian, in speaking of good cheeses,\r\nmentions those of Chauny, in Picardy, and of Brehemont, in Touraine;\r\nCharles Estienne praises those of Craponne, in Auvergne, the _angelots_ of\r\nNormandy, and the cheeses made from fresh cream which the peasant-women of\r\nMontreuil and Vincennes brought to Paris in small wickerwork baskets, and\r\nwhich were eaten sprinkled with sugar. The same author names also the\r\n_rougerets_ of Lyons, which were always much esteemed; but, above all the\r\ncheeses of Europe, he places the round or cylindrical ones of Auvergne,\r\nwhich were only made by very clean and healthy children of fourteen years\r\nof age. Olivier de Serres advises those who wish to have good cheeses to\r\nboil the milk before churning it, a plan which is in use at Lodi and\r\nParma, \"where cheeses are made which are acknowledged by all the world to\r\nbe excellent.\"\r\n\r\nThe parmesan, which this celebrated agriculturist cites as an example,\r\nonly became the fashion in France on the return of Charles VIII. from his\r\nexpedition to Naples. Much was thought at that time of a cheese brought\r\nfrom Turkey in bladders, and of different varieties produced in Holland\r\nand Zetland. A few of these foreign products were eaten in stews and in\r\npastry, others were toasted and sprinkled with sugar and powdered\r\ncinnamon.\r\n\r\n\"Le Roman de Claris,\" a manuscript which belongs to the commencement of\r\nthe fourteenth century, says that in a town winch was taken by storm the\r\nfollowing stores were found:--:\r\n\r\n  \"Maint bon tonnel de vin,\r\n  Maint bon bacon (cochon), maint fromage à rostir.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Many a ton of wine,\r\n  Many a slice of good bacon, plenty of good roasted cheese.\")\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table Service of a Lady of Quality\r\n\r\nFac-simile of a miniature from the Romance of Renaud de Montauban, a ms.\r\nof fifteenth century Bibl. de l'Arsenal]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ladies Hunting\r\n\r\nCostumes of the fifteenth century. From a miniature in a ms. copy of\r\n_Ovid's Epistles_. No 7231 _bis._ Bibl. nat'le de Paris.]\r\n\r\nBesides cheese and butter, the Normans, who had a great many cows in their\r\nrich pastures, made a sort of fermenting liquor from the butter-milk,\r\nwhich they called _serat_, by boiling the milk with onions and garlic, and\r\nletting it cool in closed vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Manufacture of Cheeses in\r\nSwitzerland.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of\r\nMunster, folio, Basle, 1549.]\r\n\r\nIf the author of the \"Ménagier\" is to be believed, the women who sold milk\r\nby retail in the towns were well acquainted with the method of increasing\r\nits quantity at the expense of its quality. He describes how his\r\n_froumentée_, which consists of a sort of soup, is made, and states that\r\nwhen he sends his cook to make her purchases at the milk market held in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Rues de la Savonnerie, des Ecrivains, and de la\r\nVieille-Monnaie, he enjoins her particularly \"to get very fresh cow's\r\nmilk, and to tell the person who sells it not to do so if she has put\r\nwater to it; for, unless it be quite fresh, or if there be water in it, it\r\nwill turn.\"\r\n\r\nFish and Shellfish.--Freshwater fish, which was much more abundant in\r\nformer days than now, was the ordinary food of those who lived on the\r\nborders of lakes, ponds, or rivers, or who, at all events, were not so far\r\ndistant but that they could procure it fresh. There was of course much\r\ndiversity at different periods and in different countries as regards the\r\nestimation in which the various kinds of fish were held. Thus Ausone, who\r\nwas a native of Bordeaux, spoke highly of the delicacy of the perch, and\r\nasserted that shad, pike, and tench should be left to the lower orders; an\r\nopinion which was subsequently contradicted by the inhabitants of other\r\nparts of Gaul, and even by the countrymen of the Latin poet Gregory of\r\nTours, who loudly praised the Geneva trout. But a time arrived when the\r\nhigher classes preferred the freshwater fish of Orchies in Flanders, and\r\neven those of the Lyonnais. Thus we see in the thirteenth century the\r\nbarbel of Saint-Florentin held in great estimation, whereas two hundred\r\nyears later a man who was of no use, or a nonentity, was said to resemble\r\na barbel, \"which is neither good for roasting nor boiling.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--The Pond Fisherman.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut of\r\nthe \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster, folio, Basle, 1549.]\r\n\r\nIn a collection of vulgar proverbs of the twelfth century mention is made,\r\namongst the fish most in demand, besides the barbel of Saint-Florentin\r\nabove referred to, of the eels of Maine, the pike of Chalons, the lampreys\r\nof Nantes, the trout of Andeli, and the dace of Aise. The \"Ménagier\" adds\r\nseveral others to the above list, including blay, shad, roach, and\r\ngudgeon, but, above all, the carp, which was supposed to be a native of\r\nSouthern Europe, and which must have been naturalised at a much later\r\nperiod in the northern waters (Figs. 100, 101, and 102).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--The River Fisherman, designed and engraved, in\r\nthe Sixteenth Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--Conveyance of Fish by Water and\r\nLand.--Fac-simile of an Engraving in the Royal Statutes of the Provostship\r\nof Merchants, 1528.]\r\n\r\nThe most ancient documents bear witness that the natives of the sea-coasts\r\nof Europe, and particularly of the Mediterranean, fed on the same fish as\r\nat present: there were, however, a few other sea-fish, which were also\r\nused for food, but which have since been abandoned. Our ancestors were,\r\nnot difficult to please: they had good teeth, and their palates, having\r\nbecome accustomed to the flesh of the cormorant, heron, and crane, without\r\ndifficulty appreciated the delicacy of the nauseous sea-dog, the porpoise,\r\nand even the whale, which, when salted, furnished to a great extent all\r\nthe markets of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe trade in salted sea-fish only began in Paris in the twelfth century,\r\nwhen a company of merchants was instituted, or rather re-established, on\r\nthe principle of the ancient association of Nantes. This association had\r\nexisted from the period of the foundation under the Gauls of Lutetia, the\r\ncity of fluvial commerce (Fig. 103), and it is mentioned in the letters\r\npatent of Louis VII. (1170). One of the first cargoes which this company\r\nbrought in its boats was that of salted herrings from the coast of\r\nNormandy. These herrings became a necessary food during Lent, and\r\n\r\n  \"Sor et blanc harene frès pouldré (couvert de sel)!\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Herrings smoked, fresh, and salted!\")\r\n\r\nwas the cry of the retailers in the streets of Paris, where this fish\r\nbecame a permanent article of consumption to an extent which can be\r\nappreciated from the fact that Saint Louis gave annually nearly seventy\r\nthousand herrings to the hospitals, plague-houses, and monasteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.--A Votive Altar of the Nantes Parisiens, or the\r\nCompany for the Commercial Navigation of the Seine, erected in Lutelia\r\nduring the reign of Tiberius.--Fragments of this Altar, which were\r\ndiscovered in 1711 under the Choir of the Church of Notre-Dame, are\r\npreserved in the Museums of Cluny and the Palais des Thermes.]\r\n\r\nThe profit derived from the sale of herrings at that time was so great\r\nthat it soon became a special trade; it was, in fact, the regular practice\r\nof the Middle Ages for persons engaged in any branch of industry to unite\r\ntogether and form themselves into a corporation. Other speculators\r\nconceived the idea of bringing fresh fish to Paris by means of relays of\r\nposting conveyances placed along the road, and they called themselves\r\n_forains_. Laws were made to distinguish the rights of each of these\r\ntrades, and to prevent any quarrel in the competition. In these laws, all\r\nsea-fish were comprised under three names, the fresh, the salted, and the\r\nsmoked (_sor_). Louis IX. in an edict divides the dealers into two\r\nclasses, namely, the sellers of fresh fish, and the sellers of salt or\r\nsmoked fish. Besides salt and fresh herrings, an enormous amount of salted\r\nmackerel, which was almost as much used, was brought from the sea-coast,\r\nin addition to flat-fish, gurnets, skate, fresh and salted whiting and\r\ncodfish.\r\n\r\nIn an old document of the thirteenth century about fifty kinds of fish are\r\nenumerated which were retailed in the markets of the kingdom; and a\r\ncentury later the \"Ménagier\" gives receipts for cooking forty kinds,\r\namongst which appears, under the name of _craspois_, the salted flesh of\r\nthe whale, which was also called _le lard de carême_. This coarse food,\r\nwhich was sent from the northern seas in enormous slices, was only eaten\r\nby the lower orders, for, according to a writer of the sixteenth century,\r\n\"were it cooked even for twenty-four hours it would still be very hard and\r\nindigestible.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Proverbes\" of the thirteenth century, which mention the freshwater\r\nfish then in vogue, also names the sea-fish most preferred, and whence\r\nthey came, namely, the shad from Bordeaux, the congers from La Rochelle,\r\nthe sturgeon from Blaye, the fresh herrings from Fécamp, and the\r\ncuttle-fish from Coutances. At a later period the conger was not eaten\r\nfrom its being supposed to produce the plague. The turbot, John-dory,\r\nskate and sole, which were very dear, were reserved for the rich. The\r\nfishermen fed on the sea-dragon. A great quantity of the small sea\r\ncrayfish were brought into market; and in certain countries these were\r\ncalled _santé_, because the doctors recommended them to invalids or those\r\nin consumption; on the other hand, freshwater crayfish were not much\r\nesteemed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, excepting for their\r\neggs, which were prepared with spice. It is well known that pond frogs\r\nwere a favourite food of the Gauls and Franks; they were never out of\r\nfashion in the rural districts, and were served at the best tables,\r\ndressed with green sauce; at the same period, and especially during Lent,\r\nsnails, which were served in pyramid-shaped dishes, were much appreciated;\r\nso much so that nobles and bourgeois cultivated snail beds, somewhat\r\nresembling our oyster beds of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the coast at all periods ate various kinds of\r\nshell-fish, which were called in Italy sea-fruit; but it was only towards\r\nthe twelfth century that the idea was entertained of bringing oysters to\r\nParis, and mussels were not known there until much later. It is notorious\r\nthat Henry IV. was a great oyster-eater. Sully relates that when he was\r\ncreated a duke \"the king came, without being expected, to take his seat at\r\nthe reception banquet, but as there was much delay in going to dinner, he\r\nbegan by eating some _huîtres de chasse_, which he found very fresh.\"\r\n\r\nBy _huîtres de chasse_ were meant those oysters which were brought by the\r\n_chasse-marées_, carriers who brought the fresh fish from the coast to\r\nParis at great speed.\r\n\r\nBeverages.--Beer is not only one of the oldest fermenting beverages used\r\nby man, but it is also the one which was most in vogue in the Middle Ages.\r\nIf we refer to the tales of the Greek historians, we find that the\r\nGauls--who, like the Egyptians, attributed the discovery of this\r\nrefreshing drink to their god Osiris--had two sorts of beer: one called\r\n_zythus_, made with honey and intended for the rich; the other called\r\n_corma_, in which there was no honey, and which was made for the poor. But\r\nPliny asserts that beer in Gallie was called _cerevisia_, and the grain\r\nemployed for making it _brasce_. This testimony seems true, as from\r\n_brasce_ or _brasse_ comes the name _brasseur_ (brewer), and from\r\n_cerevisia, cervoise_, the generic name by which beer was known for\r\ncenturies, and which only lately fell into disuse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--The Great Drinkers of the North.--Fac-simile of\r\na Woodcut of the \"Histoires des Pays Septentrionaux,\" by Olaus Magnus,\r\n16mo., Antwerp, 1560.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a great famine, Domitian ordered all the vines in Gaul to be\r\nuprooted so as to make room for corn. This rigorous measure must have\r\ncaused beer to become even more general, and, although two centuries later\r\nProbus allowed vines to be replanted, the use of beverages made from grain\r\nbecame an established custom; but in time, whilst the people still only\r\ndrank _cervoise_, those who were able to afford it bought wine and drank\r\nit alternately with beer.\r\n\r\nHowever, as by degrees the vineyards increased in all places having a\r\nsuitable soil and climate, the use of beer was almost entirely given up,\r\nso that in central Gaul wine became so common and cheap that all could\r\ndrink it. In the northern provinces, where the vine would not grow, beer\r\nnaturally continued to be the national beverage (Fig. 104).\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charlemagne, for instance, we find the Emperor wisely\r\nordered that persons knowing how to brew should be attached to each of his\r\nfarms. Everywhere the monastic houses possessed breweries; but as early as\r\nthe reign of St. Louis there were only a very few breweries in Paris\r\nitself, and, in spite of all the privileges granted to their corporation,\r\neven these were soon obliged to leave the capital, where there ceased to\r\nbe any demand for the produce of their industry. They reappeared in 1428,\r\nprobably in consequence of the political and commercial relations which\r\nhad become established between Paris and the rich towns of the Flemish\r\nbourgeoisie; and then, either on account of the dearness of wine, or the\r\ncaprice of fashion, the consumption of beer again became so general in\r\nFrance that, according to the \"Journal d'un Bourgeois de Paris,\" it\r\nproduced to the revenue two-thirds more than wine. It must be understood,\r\nhowever, that in times of scarcity, as in the years 1415 and 1482, brewing\r\nwas temporarily stopped, and even forbidden altogether, on account of the\r\nquantity of grain which was thereby withdrawn from the food supply of the\r\npeople (Fig. 105).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--The Brewer, designed and engraved, in the\r\nSixteenth. Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nUnder the Romans, the real _cervoise_, or beer, was made with barley; but,\r\nat a later period, all sorts of grain was indiscriminately used; and it\r\nwas only towards the end of the sixteenth century that adding the flower\r\nor seed of hops to the oats or barley, which formed the basis of this\r\nbeverage, was thought of.\r\n\r\nEstienne Boileau's \"Book of Trades,\" edited in the thirteenth century,\r\nshows us that, besides the _cervoise_, another sort of beer was known,\r\nwhich was called _godale_. This name, we should imagine, was derived from\r\nthe two German words _god ael_, which mean \"good beer,\" and was of a\r\nstronger description than the ordinary _cervoise_; this idea is proved by\r\nthe Picards and Flemish people calling it \"double beer.\" In any case, it\r\nis from the word _godale_ that the familiar expression of _godailler_ (to\r\ntipple) is derived.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is hardly any sort of mixture or ingredient which has not\r\nbeen used in the making of beer, according to the fashions of the\r\ndifferent periods. When, on the return from the Crusades, the use of spice\r\nhad become the fashion, beverages as well as the food were loaded with it.\r\nAllspice, juniper, resin, apples, bread-crumbs, sage, lavender, gentian,\r\ncinnamon, and laurel were each thrown into it. The English sugared it, and\r\nthe Germans salted it, and at times they even went so far as to put darnel\r\ninto it, at the risk of rendering the mixture poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe object of these various mixtures was naturally to obtain\r\nhigh-flavoured beers, which became so much in fashion, that to describe\r\nthe want of merit of persons, or the lack of value in anything, no simile\r\nwas more common than to compare them to \"small beer.\" Nevertheless, more\r\ndelicate and less blunted palates were to be found which could appreciate\r\nbeer sweetened simply with honey, or scented with ambergris or\r\nraspberries. It is possible, however, that these compositions refer to\r\nmixtures in which beer, the produce of fermented grain, was confounded\r\nwith hydromel, or fermented honey. Both these primitive drinks claim an\r\norigin equally remote, which is buried in the most distant periods of\r\nhistory, and they have been used in all parts of the world, being\r\nmentioned in the oldest historical records, in the Bible, the Edda, and in\r\nthe sacred books of India. In the thirteenth century, hydromel, which then\r\nbore the name of _borgérafre, borgéraste_, or _bochet_, was composed of\r\none part of honey to twelve parts of water, scented with herbs, and\r\nallowed to ferment for a month or six weeks. This beverage, which in the\r\ncustoms and statutes of the order of Cluny is termed _potus dulcissimus_\r\n(the sweetest beverage), and which must have been both agreeable in taste\r\nand smell, was specially appreciated by the monks, who feasted on it on\r\nthe great anniversaries of the Church. Besides this, an inferior quality\r\nof _bochet_ was made for the consumption of the lower orders and peasants,\r\nout of the honeycomb after the honey had been drained away, or with the\r\nscum which rose during the fermentation of the better qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--The Vintagers, after a Miniature of the \"Dialogues\r\nde Saint Gregoire\" (Thirteenth Century).--Manuscript of the Royal Library\r\nof Brussels.]\r\n\r\nCider (in Latin _sicera_) and perry can also both claim a very ancient\r\norigin, since they are mentioned by Pliny. It does not appear, however,\r\nthat the Gauls were acquainted with them. The first historical mention of\r\nthem is made with reference to a repast which Thierry II., King of\r\nBurgundy and Orleans (596-613), son of Childebert, and grandson of Queen\r\nBrunehaut, gave to St. Colomban, in which both cider and wine were used.\r\nIn the thirteenth century, a Latin poet (Guillaume le Breton) says that\r\nthe inhabitants of the Auge and of Normandy made cider their daily drink;\r\nbut it is not likely that this beverage was sent away from the localities\r\nwhere it was made; for, besides the fact that the \"Ménagier\" only very\r\ncurtly mentions a drink made of apples, we know that in the fifteenth\r\ncentury the Parisians were satisfied with pouring water on apples, and\r\nsteeping them, so as to extract a sort of half-sour, half-sweet drink\r\ncalled _dépense_. Besides this, Paulmier de Grandmesnil, a Norman by\r\nbirth, a famous doctor, and the author of a Latin treatise on wine and\r\ncider (1588), asserts that half a century before, cider was very scarce at\r\nRouen, and that in all the districts of Caux the people only drank beer.\r\nDuperron adds that the Normans brought cider from Biscay, when their crops\r\nof apples failed.\r\n\r\nBy whom and at what period the vine was naturalised in Gaul has been a\r\nlong-disputed question, which, in spite of the most careful research,\r\nremains unsolved. The most plausible opinion is that which attributes the\r\nhonour of having imported the vine to the Phoenician colony who founded\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\nPliny makes mention of several wines of the Gauls as being highly\r\nesteemed. He nevertheless reproaches the vine-growers of Marseilles,\r\nBeziers, and Narbonne with doctoring their wines, and with infusing\r\nvarious drugs into them, which rendered them disagreeable and even\r\nunwholesome (Fig. 106). Dioscorides, however, approved of the custom in\r\nuse among the Allobroges, of mixing resin with their wines to preserve\r\nthem and prevent them from turning sour, as the temperature of their\r\ncountry was not warm enough thoroughly to ripen the grape.\r\n\r\nRooted up by order of Domitian in 92, as stated above, the vine only\r\nreappeared in Gaul under Protus, who revoked, in 282, the imperial edict\r\nof his predecessor; after which period the Gallic wines soon recovered\r\ntheir ancient celebrity. Under the dominion of the Franks, who held wine\r\nin great favour, vineyard property was one of those which the barbaric\r\nlaws protected with the greatest care. We find in the code of the Salians\r\nand in that of the Visigoths very severe penalties for uprooting a vine or\r\nstealing a bunch of grapes. The cultivation of the vine became general,\r\nand kings themselves planted them, even in the gardens of their city\r\npalaces. In 1160, there was still in Paris, near the Louvre, a vineyard of\r\nsuch an extent, that Louis VII. could annually present six hogsheads of\r\nwine made from it to the rector of St. Nicholas. Philip Augustus possessed\r\nabout twenty vineyards of excellent quality in various parts of his\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the vine having thus developed, the wine trade acquired an\r\nenormous importance in France. Gascony, Aunis, and Saintonge sent their\r\nwines to Flanders; Guyenne sent hers to England. Froissart writes that, in\r\n1372, a merchant fleet of quite two hundred sail came from London to\r\nBordeaux for wine. This flourishing trade received a severe blow in the\r\nsixteenth century; for an awful famine having invaded France in 1566,\r\nCharles IX. did not hesitate to repeat the acts of Domitian, and to order\r\nall the vines to be uprooted and their place to be sown with corn;\r\nfortunately Henry III. soon after modified this edict by simply\r\nrecommending the governors of the provinces to see that \"the ploughs were\r\nnot being neglected in their districts on account of the excessive\r\ncultivation of the vine.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--Interior of an Hostelry.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in a folio edition of Virgil, published at Lyons in 1517.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the trade of a wine-merchant is one of the oldest established in\r\nParis, it does not follow that the retail sale of wine was exclusively\r\ncarried on by special tradesmen. On the contrary, for a long time the\r\nowner of the vineyard retailed the wine which he had not been able to sell\r\nin the cask. A broom, a laurel-wreath, or some other sign of the sort hung\r\nover a door, denoted that any one passing could purchase or drink wine\r\nwithin. When the wine-growers did not have the quality and price of their\r\nwine announced in the village or town by the public crier, they placed a\r\nman before the door of their cellar, who enticed the public to enter and\r\ntaste the new wines. Other proprietors, instead of selling for people to\r\ntake away in their own vessels, established a tavern in some room of their\r\nhouse, where they retailed drink (Fig. 107). The monks, who made wine\r\nextensively, also opened these taverns in the monasteries, as they only\r\nconsumed part of their wine themselves; and this system was universally\r\nadopted by wine-growers, and even by the king and the nobles. The latter,\r\nhowever, had this advantage, that, whilst they were retailing their wines,\r\nno one in the district was allowed to enter into competition with them.\r\nThis prescriptive right, which was called _droit de ban-vin_, was still in\r\nforce in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSaint Louis granted special statutes to the wine-merchants in 1264; but it\r\nwas only three centuries later that they formed a society, which was\r\ndivided into four classes, namely, hotel-keepers, publichouse-keepers,\r\ntavern proprietors, and dealers in wine _à pot_, that is, sold to people\r\nto take away with them. Hotel-keepers, also called _aubergistes_,\r\naccommodated travellers, and also put up horses and carriages. The dealers\r\n_à pot_ sold wine which could not be drunk on their premises. There was\r\ngenerally a sort of window in their door through which the empty pot was\r\npassed, to be returned filled: hence the expression, still in use in the\r\neighteenth century, _vente a huis coupé_ (sale through a cut door).\r\nPublichouse-keepers supplied drink as well as _nappe et assiette_\r\n(tablecloth and plate), which meant that refreshments were also served.\r\nAnd lastly, the _taverniers_ sold wine to be drunk on the premises, but\r\nwithout the right of supplying bread or meat to their customers (Figs 108\r\nand 109).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--Banner of the Corporation of the\r\nPublichouse-keepers of Montmedy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--Banner of the Corporation of the\r\nPublichouse-keepers of Tonnerre.]\r\n\r\nThe wines of France in most request from the ninth to the thirteenth\r\ncenturies were those of Mâcon, Cahors, Rheims, Choisy, Montargis, Marne,\r\nMeulan, and Orléanais. Amongst the latter there was one which was much\r\nappreciated by Henry I., and of which he kept a store, to stimulate his\r\ncourage when he joined his army. The little fable of the Battle of Wines,\r\ncomposed in the thirteenth century by Henri d'Andelys, mentions a number\r\nof wines which have to this day maintained their reputation: for instance,\r\nthe Beaune, in Burgundy; the Saint-Emilion, in Gruyenne; the Chablis,\r\nEpernay, Sézanne, in Champagne, &c. But he places above all, with good\r\nreason, according to the taste of those days, the Saint-Pourçain of\r\nAuvergne, which was then most expensive and in great request. Another\r\nFrench poet, in describing the luxurious habits of a young man of fashion,\r\nsays that he drank nothing but Saint-Pourçain; and in a poem composed by\r\nJean Bruyant, secretary of the Châtelet of Paris, in 1332, we find\r\n\r\n                 \"Du saint-pourçain\r\n  Que l'on met en son sein pour sain.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Saint-Pourçain wine, which you imbibe for the good of your health.\")\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--Banner of the Coopers of Bayonne.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Banner of the Coopers of La Rochelle.]\r\n\r\nTowards 1400, the vineyards of Aï became celebrated for Champagne as those\r\nof Beaune were for Burgundy; and it is then that we find, according to the\r\ntestimony of the learned Paulmier de Grandmesnil, kings and queens making\r\nchampagne their favourite beverage. Tradition has it that Francis I.,\r\nCharles Quint, Henry VIII., and Pope Leon X. all possessed vineyards in\r\nChampagne at the same time. Burgundy, that pure and pleasant wine, was not\r\ndespised, and it was in its honour that Erasmus said, \"Happy province! she\r\nmay well call herself the mother of men, since she produces such milk.\"\r\nNevertheless, the above-mentioned physician, Paulmier, preferred to\r\nburgundy, \"if not perhaps for their flavour, yet for their wholesomeness,\r\nthe vines of the _Ile de France_ or _vins français_, which agree, he says,\r\nwith scholars, invalids, the bourgeois, and all other persons who do not\r\ndevote themselves to manual labour; for they do not parch the blood, like\r\nthe wines of Gascony, nor fly to the head like those of Orleans and\r\nChâteau-Thierry; nor do they cause obstructions like those of Bordeaux.\"\r\nThis is also the opinion of Baccius, who in his Latin treatise on the\r\nnatural history of wines (1596) asserts that the wines of Paris \"are in no\r\nway inferior to those of any other district of the kingdom.\" These thin\r\nand sour wines, so much esteemed in the first periods of monarchy and so\r\nlong abandoned, first lost favour in the reign of Francis I., who\r\npreferred the strong and stimulating productions of the South.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great number of excellent wines made in their own\r\ncountry, the French imported from other lands. In the thirteenth century,\r\nin the \"Battle of Wines\" we find those of Aquila, Spain, and, above all,\r\nthose of Cyprus, spoken of in high terms. A century later, Eustace\r\nDeschamps praised the Rhine wines, and those of Greece, Malmsey, and\r\nGrenache. In an edict of Charles VI. mention is also made of the muscatel,\r\nrosette, and the wine of Lieppe. Generally, the Malmsey which was drunk in\r\nFrance was an artificial preparation, which had neither the colour nor\r\ntaste of the Cyprian wine. Olivier de Serres tells us that in his time it\r\nwas made with water, honey, clary juice, beer grounds, and brandy. At\r\nfirst the same name was used for the natural wine, mulled and spiced,\r\nwhich was produced in the island of Madeira from the grapes which the\r\nPortuguese brought there from Cyprus in 1420.\r\n\r\nThe reputation which this wine acquired in Europe induced Francis I. to\r\nimport some vines from Greece, and he planted fifty acres with them near\r\nFontainebleau. It was at first considered that this plant was succeeding\r\nso well, that \"there were hopes,\" says Olivier de Serres, \"that France\r\nwould soon be able to furnish her own Malmsey and Greek wines, instead of\r\nhaving to import them from abroad.\" It is evident, however, that they soon\r\ngave up this delusion, and that for want of the genuine wine they returned\r\nto artificial beverages, such as _vin cuit_, or cooked wine, which had at\r\nall times been cleverly prepared by boiling down new wine and adding\r\nvarious aromatic herbs to it.\r\n\r\nMany wines were made under the name of _herbés_, which were merely\r\ninfusions of wormwood, myrtle, hyssop, rosemary, &c., mixed with sweetened\r\nwine and flavoured with honey. The most celebrated of these beverages\r\nbore the pretentious name of \"nectar;\" those composed of spices, Asiatic\r\naromatics, and honey, were generally called \"white wine,\" a name\r\nindiscriminately applied to liquors having for their bases some slightly\r\ncoloured wine, as well as to the hypocras, which was often composed of a\r\nmixture of foreign liqueurs. This hypocras plays a prominent part in the\r\nromances of chivalry, and was considered a drink of honour, being always\r\noffered to kings, princes, and nobles on their solemn entry into a town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--Butler at his Duties.--Fac-simile from a Woodcut\r\nin the \"Cosmographie Universelle,\" of Munster, folio, Basle, 1549.]\r\n\r\nThe name of wine was also given to drinks composed of the juices of\r\ncertain fruits, and in which grapes were in no way used. These were the\r\ncherry, the currant, the raspberry, and the pomegranate wines; also the\r\n_moré_, made with the mulberry, which was so extolled by the poets of the\r\nthirteenth century. We must also mention the sour wines, which were made\r\nby pouring water on the refuse grapes after the wine had been extracted;\r\nalso the drinks made from filberts, milk of almonds, the syrups of\r\napricots and strawberries, and cherry and raspberry waters, all of which\r\nwere refreshing, and were principally used in summer; and, lastly,\r\n_tisane_, sold by the confectioners of Paris, and made hot or cold, with\r\nprepared barley, dried grapes, plums, dates, gum, or liquorice. This\r\n_tisane_ may be considered as the origin of that drink which is now sold\r\nto the poor at a sous a glass, and which most assuredly has not much\r\nimproved since olden times.\r\n\r\nIt was about the thirteenth century that brandy first became known in\r\nFrance; but it does not appear that it was recognised as a liqueur before\r\nthe sixteenth. The celebrated physician Arnauld de Villeneuve, who wrote\r\nat the end of the thirteenth century, to whom credit has wrongly been\r\ngiven for inventing brandy, employed it as one of his remedies, and thus\r\nexpresses himself about it: \"Who would have believed that we could have\r\nderived from wine a liquor which neither resembles it in nature, colour,\r\nor effect?.... This _eau de vin_ is called by some _eau de vie_, and justly\r\nso, since it prolongs life.... It prolongs health, dissipates superfluous\r\nmatters, revives the spirits, and preserves youth. Alone, or added to some\r\nother proper remedy, it cures colic, dropsy, paralysis, ague, gravel, &c.\"\r\n\r\nAt a period when so many doctors, alchemists, and other learned men made\r\nit their principal occupation to try to discover that marvellous golden\r\nfluid which was to free the human race of all its original infirmities,\r\nthe discovery of such an elixir could not fail to attract the attention of\r\nall such manufacturers of panaceas. It was, therefore, under the name of\r\n_eau d'or_ (_aqua auri_) that brandy first became known to the world; a\r\nname improperly given to it, implying as it did that it was of mineral\r\norigin, whereas its beautiful golden colour was caused by the addition of\r\nspices. At a later period, when it lost its repute as a medicine, they\r\nactually sprinkled it with pure gold leaves, and at the same time that it\r\nceased to be exclusively considered as a remedy, it became a favourite\r\nbeverage. It was also employed in distilleries, especially as the basis of\r\nvarious strengthening and exciting liqueurs, most of which have descended\r\nto us, some coming from monasteries and others from châteaux, where they\r\nhad been manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoups, broths, and stews, &c.--The French word _potage_ must originally\r\nhave signified a soup composed of vegetables and herbs from the kitchen\r\ngarden, but from the remotest times it was applied to soups in general.\r\n\r\nAs the Gauls, according to Athenæus, generally ate their meat boiled, we\r\nmust presume that they made soup with the water in which it was cooked. It\r\nis related that one day Gregory of Tours was sitting at the table of King\r\nChilpéric, when the latter offered him a soup specially made in his honour\r\nfrom chicken. The poems of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries mention\r\nsoups made of peas, of bacon, of vegetables, and of groats. In the\r\nsouthern provinces there were soups made of almonds, and of olive oil.\r\nWhen Du Gueselin went out to fight the English knight William of\r\nBlancbourg in single combat, he first ate three sorts of soup made with\r\nwine, \"in honour of the three persons in the Holy Trinity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--Interior of a Kitchen of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury.--Fac-simile from a Woodcut in the \"Calendarium Romanum\" of Jean\r\nStaéffler, folio, Tubingen, 1518.]\r\n\r\nWe find in the \"Ménagier,\" amongst a long list of the common soups the\r\nreceipts for which are given, soup made of \"dried peas and the water in\r\nwhich bacon has been boiled,\" and, in Lent, \"salted-whale water;\"\r\nwatercress soup, cabbage soup, cheese soup, and _gramose_ soup, which was\r\nprepared by adding stewed meat to the water in which meat had already been\r\nboiled, and adding beaten eggs and verjuice; and, lastly, the _souppe\r\ndespourvue_, which was rapidly made at the hotels, for unexpected\r\ntravellers, and was a sort of soup made from the odds and ends of the\r\nlarder. In those days there is no doubt but that hot soup formed an\r\nindispensable part of the daily meals, and that each person took it at\r\nleast twice a day, according to the old proverb:--\r\n\r\n  \"Soupe la soir, soupe le matin,\r\n  C'est l'ordinaire du bon chrétien.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Soup in the evening, and soup in the morning,\r\n  Is the everyday food of a good Christian.\")\r\n\r\nThe cooking apparatus of that period consisted of a whole glittering array\r\nof cauldrons, saucepans, kettles, and vessels of red and yellow copper,\r\nwhich hardly sufficed for all the rich soups for which France was so\r\nfamous. Thence the old proverb, \"En France sont les grands soupiers.\"\r\n\r\nBut besides these soups, which were in fact looked upon as \"common, and\r\nwithout spice,\" a number of dishes were served under the generic name of\r\nsoup, which constituted the principal luxuries at the great tables in the\r\nfourteenth century, but which do not altogether bear out the names under\r\nwhich we find them. For instance, there was haricot mutton, a sort of\r\nstew; thin chicken broth; veal broth with herbs; soup made of veal, roe,\r\nstag, wild boar, pork, hare and rabbit soup flavoured with green peas, &c.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of these soups were very rich, very expensive, several\r\nbeing served at the same time; and in order to please the eye as well as\r\nthe taste they were generally made of various colours, sweetened with\r\nsugar, and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and aromatic herbs, such as\r\nmarjoram, sage, thyme, sweet basil, savoury, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Coppersmith, designed and engraved in the\r\nSixteenth Century by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nThese descriptions of soups were perfect luxuries, and were taken instead\r\nof sweets. As a proof of this we must refer to the famous _soupe dorée_,\r\nthe description of which is given by Taillevent, head cook of Charles\r\nVII., in the following words, \"Toast slices of bread, throw them into a\r\njelly made of sugar, white wine, yolk of egg, and rosewater; when they are\r\nwell soaked fry them, then throw them again into the rosewater and\r\nsprinkle them with sugar and saffron.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--Kitchen and Table Uensils:--\r\n\r\n  1, Carving-knife (Sixteenth Century);\r\n  2, Chalice or Cup, with Cover (Fourteenth Century);\r\n  3, Doubled-handled Pot, in Copper (Ninth Century);\r\n  4, Metal Boiler, or Tin Pot, taken from \"L'Histoire de la Belle Hélaine\"\r\n    (Fifteenth Century);\r\n  5, Knife (Sixteenth Century);\r\n  6, Pot, with Handles (Fourteenth Century);\r\n  7, Copper Boiler, taken from \"L'Histoire de la Belle Hélaine\" (Fifteenth\r\n     Century);\r\n  8, Ewer, with Handle, in Oriental Fashion (Ninth Century);\r\n  9, Pitcher, sculptured, from among the Decorations of the Church of St.\r\n     Benedict, Paris (Fifteenth Century);\r\n 10, Two-branched Candlestick (Sixteenth Century);\r\n 11, Cauldron (Fifteenth Century).\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that even now this kind of soup might find some favour;\r\nbut we cannot say the same for those made with mustard, hemp-seed, millet,\r\nverjuice, and a number of others much in repute at that period; for we see\r\nin Rabelais that the French were the greatest soup eaters in the world,\r\nand boasted to be the inventors of seventy sorts.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that broths were in use at the remotest periods,\r\nfor, from the time that the practice of boiling various meats was first\r\nadopted, it must have been discovered that the water in which they were so\r\nboiled became savoury and nourishing. \"In the time of the great King\r\nFrancis I.,\" says Noël du Fail, in his \"Contes d'Eutrapel,\" \"in many\r\nplaces the saucepan was put on to the table, on which there was only one\r\nother large dish, of beef, mutton, veal, and bacon, garnished with a large\r\nbunch of cooked herbs, the whole of which mixture composed a porridge, and\r\na real restorer and elixir of life. From this came the adage, 'The soup in\r\nthe great pot and the dainties in the hotch-potch.'\"\r\n\r\nAt one time they made what they imagined to be strengthening broths for\r\ninvalids, though their virtue must have been somewhat delusive, for, after\r\nhaving boiled down various materials in a close kettle and at a slow fire,\r\nthey then distilled from this, and the water thus obtained was\r\nadministered as a sovereign remedy. The common sense of Bernard Palissy\r\ndid not fail to make him see this absurdity, and to protest against this\r\nridiculous custom: \"Take a capon,\" he says, \"a partridge, or anything\r\nelse, cook it well, and then if you smell the broth you will find it very\r\ngood, and if you taste it you will find it has plenty of flavour; so much\r\nso that you will feel that it contains something to invigorate you. Distil\r\nthis, on the contrary, and take the water then collected and taste it, and\r\nyou will find it insipid, and without smell except that of burning. This\r\nshould convince you that your restorer does not give that nourishment to\r\nthe weak body for which you recommend it as a means of making good blood,\r\nand restoring and strengthening the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nThe taste for broths made of flour was formerly almost universal in France\r\nand over the whole of Europe; it is spoken of repeatedly in the histories\r\nand annals of monasteries; and we know that the Normans, who made it their\r\nprincipal nutriment, were surnamed _bouilleux_. They were indeed almost\r\nlike the Romans who in olden times, before their wars with eastern\r\nnations, gave up making bread, and ate their corn simply boiled in water.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the broths and soups were made with\r\nmillet-flour and mixed wheats. The pure wheat flour was steeped in milk\r\nseasoned with sugar, saffron, honey, sweet wine or aromatic herbs, and\r\nsometimes butter, fat, and yolks of eggs were added. It was on account of\r\nthis that the bread of the ancients so much resembled cakes, and it was\r\nalso from this fact that the art of the pastrycook took its rise.\r\n\r\nWheat made into gruel for a long time was an important ingredient in\r\ncooking, being the basis of a famous preparation called _fromentée_, which\r\nwas a _bouillie_ of milk, made creamy by the addition of yolks of eggs,\r\nand which served as a liquor in which to roast meats and fish. There were,\r\nbesides, several sorts of _fromentée_, all equally esteemed, and\r\nTaillevent recommended the following receipt, which differs from the one\r\nabove given:--\"First boil your wheat in water, then put into it the juice\r\nor gravy of fat meat, or, if you like it better, milk of almonds, and by\r\nthis means you will make a soup fit for fasts, because it dissolves\r\nslowly, is of slow digestion and nourishes much. In this way, too, you can\r\nmake _ordiat_, or barley soup, which is more generally approved than the\r\nsaid _fromentée_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--Interior of a Kitchen.--Fac-simile from a\r\nWoodcut in the \"Calendarium Romanum\" of J. Staéffler, folio, Tubingen,\r\n1518.]\r\n\r\nSemolina, vermicelli, macaroni, &c., which were called Italian because\r\nthey originally came from that country, have been in use in France longer\r\nthan is generally supposed. They were first introduced after the\r\nexpedition of Charles VIII. into Italy, and the conquest of the kingdom of\r\nNaples; that is, in the reign of Louis XII., or the first years of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nPies, Stews, Roasts, Salads, &c.--Pastry made with fat, which might be\r\nsupposed to have been the invention of modern kitchens, was in great\r\nrepute amongst our ancestors. The manufacture of sweet and savoury pastry\r\nwas intrusted to the care of the good _ménagiers_ of all ranks and\r\nconditions, and to the corporation of pastrycooks, who obtained their\r\nstatutes only in the middle of the sixteenth century; the united skill of\r\nthese, both in Paris and in the provinces, multiplied the different sorts\r\nof tarts and meat pies to a very great extent. So much was this the case\r\nthat these ingenious productions became a special art, worthy of rivalling\r\neven cookery itself (Figs. 117, 118, and 130). One of the earliest known\r\nreceipts for making pies is that of Gaces de la Bigne, first chaplain of\r\nKings John, Charles V., and Charles VI. We find it in a sporting poem, and\r\nit deserves to be quoted verbatim as a record of the royal kitchen of the\r\nfourteenth century. It will be observed on perusing it that nothing was\r\nspared either in pastry or in cookery, and that expense was not considered\r\nwhen it was a question of satisfying the appetite.\r\n\r\n  \"Trois perdriaulx gros et reffais\r\n  Au milieu du paté me mets;\r\n  Mais gardes bien que tu ne failles\r\n  A moi prendre six grosses cailles,\r\n  De quoi tu les apuyeras.\r\n  Et puis après tu me prendras\r\n  Une douzaine d'alouètes\r\n  Qu'environ les cailles me mettes,\r\n  Et puis pendras de ces machés\r\n  Et de ces petits oiselés:\r\n  Selon ce que tu en auras,\r\n  Le paté m'en billeteras.\r\n  Or te fault faire pourvéance\r\n  D'un pen de lart, sans point de rance,\r\n  Que tu tailleras comme dé:\r\n  S'en sera le pasté pouldré.\r\n  S tu le veux de bonne guise,\r\n  Du vertjus la grappe y soit mise,\r\n  D'un bien peu de sel soit pouldré ...\r\n  ...

We\r\nmay mention also the small pies, which were made of minced beef and\r\nraisins, similar to our mince pies, and which were hawked in the streets\r\nof Paris, until their sale was forbidden, because the trade encouraged\r\ngreediness on the one hand and laziness on the other.\r\n\r\nAncient pastries, owing to their shapes, received the name of _tourte_ or\r\n_tarte_, from the Latin _torta_, a large hunch of bread. This name was\r\nafterwards exclusively used for hot pies, whether they contained\r\nvegetables, meat, or fish. But towards the end of the fourteenth century\r\n_tourte_ and _tarte_ was applied to pastry containing, herbs, fruits, or\r\npreserves, and _pâté_ to those containing any kind of meat, game, or fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--Banner of the Corporation of Pastrycooks of\r\nCaen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.--Banner of the Corporation of Pastrycooks of\r\nBordeaux.]\r\n\r\nIt was only in the course of the sixteenth century that the name of\r\n_potage_ ceased to be applied to stews, whose number equalled their\r\nvariety, for on a bill of fare of a banquet of that period we find more\r\nthan fifty different sorts of _potages_ mentioned. The greater number of\r\nthese dishes have disappeared from our books on cookery, having gone out\r\nof fashion; but there are two stews which were popular during many\r\ncenturies, and which have maintained their reputation, although they do\r\nnot now exactly represent what they formerly did. The _pot-pourri_, which\r\nwas composed of veal, beef, mutton, bacon, and vegetables, and the\r\n_galimafrée_, a fricassee of poultry, sprinkled with verjuice, flavoured\r\nwith spices, and surrounded by a sauce composed of vinegar, bread crumbs,\r\ncinnamon, ginger, &c. (Fig. 119).\r\n\r\nThe highest aim of the cooks of the Taillevent school was to make dishes\r\nnot only palatable, but also pleasing to the eye. These masters in the art\r\nof cooking might be said to be both sculptors and painters, so much did\r\nthey decorate their works, their object being to surprise or amuse the\r\nguests by concealing the real nature of the disbes. Froissart, speaking of\r\na repast given in his time, says that there were a number of \"dishes so\r\ncurious and disguised that it was impossible to guess what they were.\" For\r\ninstance, the bill of fare above referred to mentions a lion and a sun\r\nmade of white chicken, a pink jelly, with diamond-shaped points; and, as\r\nif the object of cookery was to disguise food and deceive epicures,\r\nTaillevent facetiously gives us a receipt for making fried or roast butter\r\nand for cooking eggs on the spit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--Interior of Italian Kitchen.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in the Book on Cookery of Christoforo di Messisburgo, \"Banchetti\r\ncompositioni di Vivende,\" 4to., Ferrara, 1549.]\r\n\r\nThe roasts were as numerous as the stews. A treatise of the fourteenth\r\ncentury names about thirty, beginning with a sirloin of beef, which must\r\nhave been one of the most common, and ending with a swan, which appeared\r\non table in full plumage. This last was the triumph of cookery, inasmuch\r\nas it presented this magnificent bird to the eyes of the astonished guests\r\njust as if he were living and swimming. His beak was gilt, his body\r\nsilvered, resting 'on a mass of brown pastry, painted green in order to\r\nrepresent a grass field. Eight banners of silk were placed round, and a\r\ncloth of the same material served as a carpet for the whole dish, which\r\ntowered above the other appointments of the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.--Hunting-Meal.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the\r\nManuscript of the \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe peacock, which was as much thought of then as it is little valued now,\r\nwas similarly arrayed, and was brought to table amidst a flourish of\r\ntrumpets and the applause of all present. The modes of preparing other\r\nroasts much resembled the present system in their simplicity, with this\r\ndifference, that strong meats were first boiled to render them tender, and\r\nno roast was ever handed over to the skill of the carver without first\r\nbeing thoroughly basted with orange juice and rose water, and covered with\r\nsugar and powdered spices.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to mention the broiled dishes, the invention of which\r\nis attributed to hunters, and which Rabelais continually refers to as\r\nacting as stimulants and irresistibly exciting the thirst for wine at the\r\nsumptuous feasts of those voracious heroes (Fig. 120).\r\n\r\nThe custom of introducing salads after roasts was already established in\r\nthe fifteenth century. However, a salad, of whatever sort, was never\r\nbrought to table in its natural state; for, besides the raw herbs, dressed\r\nin the same manner as in our days, it contained several mixtures, such as\r\ncooked vegetables, and the crests, livers, or brains of poultry. After the\r\nsalads fish was served; sometimes fried, sometimes sliced with eggs or\r\nreduced to a sort of pulp, which was called _carpée_ or _charpie_, and\r\nsometimes it was boiled in water or wine, with strong seasoning. Near the\r\nsalads, in the course of the dinner, dishes of eggs prepared in various\r\nways were generally served. Many of these are now in use, such as the\r\npoached egg, the hard-boiled egg, egg sauce, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--Shop of a Grocer and Druggist, from a Stamp of Vriese\r\n(Seventeenth Century).]\r\n\r\nSeasonings.--We have already stated that the taste for spices much\r\nincreased in Europe after the Crusades; and in this rapid historical\r\nsketch of the food of the French people in the Middle Ages it must have\r\nbeen observed to what an extent this taste had become developed in France\r\n(Fig. 121). This was the origin of sauces, all, or almost all, of which\r\nwere highly spiced, and were generally used with boiled, roast, or grilled\r\nmeats. A few of these sauces, such as the yellow, the green, and the\r\n_caméline_, became so necessary in cooking that numerous persons took to\r\nmanufacturing them by wholesale, and they were hawked in the streets of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThese sauce-criers were first called _saulciers_, then\r\n_vinaigriers-moustardiers_, and when Louis XII. united them in a body, as\r\ntheir business had considerably increased, they were termed\r\n_sauciers-moutardiers-vinaigriers_, distillers of brandy and spirits of\r\nwine, and _buffetiers_ (from _buffet_, a sideboard).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.--The Cook, drawn and engraved, in the Sixteenth\r\nCentury, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nBut very soon the corporation became divided, no doubt from the force of\r\ncircumstances; and on one side we find the distillers, and on the other\r\nthe master-cooks and cooks, or _porte-chapes_, as they were called,\r\nbecause, when they carried on their business of cooking, they covered\r\ntheir dishes with a _chape_, that is, a cope or tin cover (Fig. 122), so\r\nas to keep them warm.\r\n\r\nThe list of sauces of the fourteenth century, given by the \"Ménagier de\r\nParis,\" is most complicated; but, on examining the receipts, it becomes\r\nclear that the variety of those preparations, intended to sharpen the\r\nappetite, resulted principally from the spicy ingredients with which they\r\nwere flavoured; and it is here worthy of remark that pepper, in these days\r\nexclusively obtained from America, was known and generally used long\r\nbefore the time of Columbus. It is mentioned in a document, of the time\r\nof Clotaire III. (660); and it is clear, therefore, that before the\r\ndiscovery of the New World pepper and spices were imported into Europe\r\nfrom the East.\r\n\r\nMustard, which was an ingredient in so many dishes, was cultivated and\r\nmanufactured in the thirteenth century in the neighbourhood of Dijon and\r\nAngers.\r\n\r\nAccording to a popular adage, garlic was the medicine (_thériaque_) of\r\npeasants; town-people for a long time greatly appreciated _aillée_, which\r\nwas a sauce made of garlic, and sold ready prepared in the streets of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe custom of using anchovies as a flavouring is also very ancient. This\r\nwas also done with _botargue_ and _cavial_, two sorts of side-dishes,\r\nwhich consisted of fishes' eggs, chiefly mullet and sturgeon, properly\r\nsalted or dried, and mixed with fresh or pickled olives. The olives for\r\nthe use of the lower orders were brought from Languedoc and Provence,\r\nwhereas those for the rich were imported from Spain and some from Syria.\r\nIt was also from the south of France that the rest of the kingdom was\r\nsupplied with olive oil, for which, to this day, those provinces have\r\npreserved their renown; but as early as the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies oil of walnuts was brought from the centre of France to Paris,\r\nand this, although cheaper, was superseded by oil extracted from the\r\npoppy.\r\n\r\nTruffles, though known and esteemed by the ancients, disappeared from the\r\ngastronomie collection of our forefathers. It was only in the fourteenth\r\ncentury that they were again introduced, but evidently without a knowledge\r\nof their culinary qualities, since, after being preserved in vinegar, they\r\nwere soaked in hot water, and afterwards served up in butter. We may also\r\nhere mention sorrel and the common mushroom, which were used in cooking\r\nduring the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of the old proverb, \"Sugar has never spoiled sauce,\" sugar\r\nwas put into all sauces which were not _piquantes_, and generally some\r\nperfumed water was added to them, such as rose-water. This was made in\r\ngreat quantities by exposing to the sun a basin full of water, covered\r\nover by another basin of glass, under which was a little vase containing\r\nrose-leaves. This rose-water was added to all stews, pastries, and\r\nbeverages. It is very doubtful as to the period at which white lump sugar\r\nbecame known in the West. However, in an account of the house of the\r\nDauphin Viennois (1333) mention is made of \"white sugar;\" and the author\r\nof the \"Ménagier de Paris\" frequently speaks of this white sugar, which,\r\nbefore the discovery, or rather colonisation, of America, was brought,\r\nready refined, from the Grecian islands, and especially from Candia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.--The _Issue de Table_.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut\r\nin the Treatise of Christoforo di Messisburgo, \"Banchetti compositioni di\r\nVivende,\" 4to., Ferrara, 1549.]\r\n\r\nVerjuice, or green juice, which, with vinegar, formed the essential basis\r\nof sauces, and is now extracted from a species of green grape, which never\r\nripens, was originally the juice of sorrel; another sort was extracted by\r\npounding the green blades of wheat. Vinegar was originally merely soured\r\nwine, as the word _vin-aigre_ denotes. The mode of manufacturing it by\r\nartificial means, in order to render the taste more pungent and the\r\nquality better, is very ancient. It is needless to state that it was\r\nscented by the infusion of herbs or flowers--roses, elder, cloves, &c.;\r\nbut it was not much before the sixteenth century that it was used for\r\npickling herbs or fruits and vegetables, such as gherkins, onions,\r\ncucumber, purslain, &c.\r\n\r\nSalt, which from the remotest periods was the condiment _par excellence_,\r\nand the trade in which had been free up to the fourteenth century, became,\r\nfrom that period, the subject of repeated taxation. The levying of these\r\ntaxes was a frequent cause of tumult amongst the people, who saw with\r\nmarked displeasure the exigencies of the excise gradually raising the\r\nprice of an article of primary necessity. We have already mentioned times\r\nduring which the price of salt was so exorbitant that the rich alone could\r\nput it in their bread. Thus, in the reign of Francis I., it was almost as\r\ndear as Indian spices.\r\n\r\nSweet Dishes, Desserts, &c.--In the fourteenth century, the first courses\r\nof a repast were called _mets_ or _assiettes_; the last, \"_entremets,\r\ndorures, issue de table, desserte_, and _boule-hors_.\"\r\n\r\nThe dessert consisted generally of baked pears, medlars, pealed walnuts,\r\nfigs, dates, peaches, grapes, filberts, spices, and white or red\r\nsugar-plums.\r\n\r\nAt the _issue de table_ wafers or some other light pastry were introduced,\r\nwhich were eaten with the hypocras wine. The _boute-hors,_ which was\r\nserved when the guests, after having washed their hands and said grace,\r\nhad passed into the drawing-room, consisted of spices, different from\r\nthose which had appeared at dessert, and intended specially to assist the\r\ndigestion; and for this object they must have been much needed,\r\nconsidering that a repast lasted several hours. Whilst eating these spices\r\nthey drank Grenache, Malmsey, or aromatic wines (Fig. 123).\r\n\r\nIt was only at the banquets and great repeats that sweet dishes and\r\n_dorures_ appeared, and they seem to have been introduced for the purpose\r\nof exhibiting the power of the imagination and the talent in execution of\r\nthe master-cook.\r\n\r\nThe _dorures_ consisted of jellies of all sorts and colours; swans,\r\npeacocks, bitterns, and herons, on gala feasts, were served in full\r\nfeather on a raised platform in the middle of the table, and hence the\r\nname of \"raised dishes.\" As for the side-dishes, properly so called, the\r\nlong list collected in the \"Ménagier\" shows us that they were served at\r\ntable indiscriminately, for stuffed chickens at times followed hashed\r\nporpoise in sauce, lark pies succeeded lamb sausages, and pike's-eggs\r\nfritters appeared after orange preserve.\r\n\r\nAt a later period the luxury of side-dishes consisted in the quantity and\r\nin the variety of the pastry; Rabelais names sixteen different sorts at\r\none repast; Taillevent mentions pastry called _covered pastry,\r\nBourbonnaise pastry, double-faced pastry, pear pastry_, and _apple\r\npastry_; Platina speaks of the _white pastry_ with quince, elder flowers,\r\nrice, roses, chestnuts, &c. The fashion of having pastry is, however, of\r\nvery ancient date, for in the book of the \"Proverbs\" of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, we find that the pies of Dourlens and the pastry of Chartres were\r\nthen in great celebrity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--The Table of a Baron, as laid out in the\r\nThirteenth Century.--Miniature from the \"Histoire de St. Graal\"\r\n(Manuscript from the Imperial Library, Paris).]\r\n\r\nIn a charter of Robert le Bouillon, Bishop of Amiens, in 1311, mention is\r\nmade of a cake composed of puff flaky paste; these cakes, however, are\r\nless ancient than the firm pastry called bean cake, or king's cake, which,\r\nfrom the earliest days of monarchy, appeared on all the tables, not only\r\nat the feast of the Epiphany, but also on every festive occasion.\r\n\r\nAmongst the dry and sweet pastries from the small oven which appeared at\r\nthe _issue de table_, the first to be noticed were those made of almonds,\r\nnuts, &c., and such choice morsels, which were very expensive; then came\r\nthe cream or cheesecakes, the _petits choux_, made of butter and eggs; the\r\n_échaudés_, of which the people were very fond, and St. Louis even\r\nallowed the bakers to cook them on Sundays and feast days for the poor;\r\nwafers, which are older than the thirteenth century; and lastly the\r\n_oublies_, which, under the names of _nieules, esterets_, and\r\n_supplications_, gave rise to such an extensive trade that a corporation\r\nwas established in Paris, called the _oublayeurs, oublayers,_ or\r\n_oublieux_, whose statutes directed that none should be admitted to\r\nexercise the trade unless he was able to make in one day 500 large\r\n_oublies_, 300 _supplications_, and 200 _esterets_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepasts and Feasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have had to treat elsewhere of the rules and regulations of the repasts\r\nunder the Merovingian and Carlovingian kings. We have also spoken of the\r\ntable service of the thirteenth century (see chapter on \"Private Life\").\r\nThe earliest author who has left us any documents on this curious subject\r\nis that excellent bourgeois to whom we owe the \"Ménagier de Paris.\" He\r\ndescribes, for instance, in its fullest details, a repast which was given\r\nin the fourteenth century by the Abbé de Lagny, to the Bishop of Paris,\r\nthe President of the Parliament, the King's attorney and advocate, and\r\nother members of his council, in all sixteen guests. We find from this\r\naccount that \"my lord of Paris, occupying the place of honour, was, in\r\nconsequence of his rank, served on covered dishes by three of his squires,\r\nas was the custom for the King, the royal princes, the dukes, and peers;\r\nthat Master President, who was seated by the side of the bishop, was also\r\nserved by one of his own servants, but on uncovered dishes, and the other\r\nguests were seated at table according to the order indicated by their\r\ntitles or charges.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill of fare of this feast, which was given on a fast-day, is the more\r\nworthy of attention, in that it proves to us what numerous resources\r\ncookery already possessed. This was especially the case as regards fish,\r\nnotwithstanding that the transport of fresh sea-fish was so difficult,\r\nowing to the bad state of the roads.\r\n\r\nFirst, a quarter of a pint of Grenache was given to each guest on sitting\r\ndown, then \"hot _eschaudés_, roast apples with white sugar-plums upon\r\nthem, roasted figs, sorrel and watercress, and rosemary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Soups.--A rich soup, composed of six trout, six tenches, white herring,\r\nfreshwater eels, salted twenty-four hours, and three whiting, soaked\r\ntwelve hours; almonds, ginger, saffron, cinnamon powder and sweetmeats.\r\n\r\n\"Salt-Water Fish.--Soles, gurnets, congers, turbots, and salmon.\r\n\r\n\"Fresh-Water Fish.--_Lux faudis_ (pike with roe), carps from the Marne,\r\nbreams.\r\n\r\n\"Side-Dishes.--Lampreys _à la boee_, orange-apples (one for each guest),\r\nporpoise with sauce, mackerel, soles, bream, and shad _à la cameline_,\r\nwith verjuice, rice and fried almonds upon them; sugar and apples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.--Officers of the Table and of the Chamber of the\r\nImperial Court: Cup-bearer, Cook, Barber, and Tailor, from a Picture in\r\nthe \"Triomphe de Maximilien T.,\" engraved by J. Resch, Burgmayer, and\r\nothers (1512), from Drawings by Albert Durer.]\r\n\r\n\"Dessert.--Stewed fruit with white and vermilion sugar-plums; figs, dates,\r\ngrapes, and filberts.\r\n\r\n\"Hypocras for _issue de table_, with _oublies_ and _supplications_.\r\n\r\n\"Wines and spices compose the _baute-hors_.\"\r\n\r\nTo this fasting repast we give by way of contrast the bill of fare at the\r\nnuptial feast of Master Helye, \"to which forty guests were bidden on a\r\nTuesday in May, a 'day of flesh.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Soups.--Capons with white sauce, ornamented with pomegranate and crimson\r\nsweetmeats.\r\n\r\n\"Roasts.--Quarter of roe-deer, goslings, young chickens, and sauces of\r\norange, cameline, and verjuice.\r\n\r\n\"Side-Dishes.--Jellies of crayfish and loach; young rabbits and pork.\r\n\r\n\"Dessert.--_Froumentée_ and venison.\r\n\r\n\"Issue.--Hypocras.\r\n\r\n\"Boute-Hors.--Wine and spices.\"\r\n\r\nThe clever editor of the \"Ménagier de Paris,\" M. le Baron Jerôme Pichon,\r\nafter giving us this curious account of the mode of living of the citizens\r\nof that day, thus sums up the whole arrangements for the table in the\r\nfourteenth century: \"The different provisions necessary for food are\r\nusually entrusted to the squires of the kitchen, and were chosen,\r\npurchased, and paid for by one or more of these officials, assisted by the\r\ncooks. The dishes prepared by the cooks were placed, by the help of the\r\nesquires, on dressers in the kitchen until the moment of serving. Thence\r\nthey were carried to the tables. Let us imagine a vast hall hung with\r\ntapestries and other brilliant stuffs. The tables are covered with fringed\r\ntable-cloths, and strewn with odoriferous herbs; one of them, called the\r\nGreat Table, is reserved for the persons of distinction. The guests are\r\ntaken to their seats by two butlers, who bring them water to wash. The\r\nGreat Table is laid out by a butler, with silver salt-cellars (Figs. 126\r\nand 127), golden goblets with lids for the high personages, spoons and\r\nsilver drinking cups. The guests eat at least certain dishes on\r\n_tranchoirs_, or large slices of thick bread, afterwards thrown into vases\r\ncalled _couloueres_ (drainers). For the other tables the salt is placed on\r\npieces of bread, scooped out for that purpose by the intendants, who are\r\ncalled _porte-chappes._ In the hall is a dresser covered with plate and\r\nvarious kinds of wine. Two squires standing near this dresser give the\r\nguests clean spoons, pour out what wine they ask for, and remove the\r\nsilver when used; two other squires superintend the conveyance of wine to\r\nthe dresser; a varlet placed under their orders is occupied with nothing\r\nbut drawing wine from the casks.\" At that time wine was not bottled, and\r\nthey drew directly from the cask the amount necessary for the day's\r\nconsumption. \"The dishes, consisting of three, four, five, and even six\r\ncourses, called _mets_ or _assiettes_, are brought in by varlets and two\r\nof the principal squires, and in certain wedding-feasts the bridegroom\r\nwalked in front of them. The dishes are placed on the table by an\r\n_asséeur_ (placer), assisted by two servants. The latter take away the\r\nremains at the conclusion of the course, and hand them over to the\r\nsquires of the kitchen who have charge of them. After the _mets_ or\r\n_assiettes_ the table-cloths are changed, and the _entremets_ are then\r\nbrought in. This course is the most brilliant of the repast, and at some\r\nof the princely banquets the dishes are made to imitate a sort of\r\ntheatrical representation. It is composed of sweet dishes, of coloured\r\njellies of swans, of peacocks, or of pheasants adorned with their\r\nfeathers, having the beak and feet gilt, and placed on the middle of the\r\ntable on a sort of pedestal. To the _entremets_, a course which does not\r\nappear on all bills of fare, succeeds the dessert. The _issue_, or exit\r\nfrom table, is mostly composed of hypocras and a sort of _oublie_ called\r\n_mestier_; or, in summer, when hypocras is out of season on account of its\r\nstrength, of apples, cheeses, and sometimes of pastries and sweetmeats.\r\nThe _boute-hors_ (wines and spices) end the repast. The guests then wash\r\ntheir hands, say grace, and pass into the _chambre de parement_ or\r\ndrawing-room. The servants then sit down and dine after their masters.\r\nThey subsequently bring the guests wine and _épices de chambre_, after\r\nwhich each retires home.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 126 and 127.--Sides of an Enamelled Salt-cellar, with\r\nsix facings representing the Labours of Hercules, made at Limoges, by\r\nPierre Raymond, for Francis I.]\r\n\r\nBut all the pomp and magnificence of the feasts of this period would have\r\nappeared paltry a century later, when royal banquets were managed by\r\nTaillevent, head cook to Charles VII. The historian of French cookery,\r\nLegrand d'Aussy, thus desoribes a great feast given in 1455 by the Count\r\nof Anjou, third son of Louis II., King of Sicily:--\r\n\r\n\"On the table was placed a centre-piece, which represented a green lawn,\r\nsurrounded with large peacocks' feathers and green branches, to which were\r\ntied violets and other sweet-smelling flowers. In the middle of this lawn\r\na fortress was placed, covered with silver. This was hollow, and formed a\r\nsort of cage, in which several live birds were shut up, their tufts and\r\nfeet being gilt. On its tower, which was gilt, three banners were placed,\r\none bearing the arms of the count, the two others those of Mesdemoiselles\r\nde Châteaubrun and de Villequier, in whose honour the feast was given.\r\n\r\n\"The first course consisted of a civet of hare, a quarter of stag which\r\nhad been a night in salt, a stuffed chicken, and a loin of veal. The two\r\nlast dishes were covered with a German sauce, with gilt sugar-plums, and\r\npomegranate seeds.... At each end, outside the green lawn, was an enormous\r\npie, surmounted with smaller pies, which formed a crown. The crust of the\r\nlarge ones was silvered all round and gilt at the top; each contained a\r\nwhole roe-deer, a gosling, three capons, six chickens, ten pigeons, one\r\nyoung rabbit, and, no doubt to serve as seasoning or stuffing, a minced\r\nloin of veal, two pounds of fat, and twenty-six hard-boiled eggs, covered\r\nwith saffron and flavoured with cloves. For the three following courses,\r\nthere was a roe-deer, a pig, a sturgeon cooked in parsley and vinegar, and\r\ncovered with powdered ginger; a kid, two goslings, twelve chickens, as\r\nmany pigeons, six young rabbits, two herons, a leveret, a fat capon\r\nstuffed, four chickens covered with yolks of eggs and sprinkled with\r\npowder _de Duc_ (spice), a wild boar, some wafers (_darioles_), and stars;\r\na jelly, part white and part red, representing the crests of the three\r\nabove-mentioned persons; cream with _Duc_ powder, covered with fennel\r\nseeds preserved in sugar; a white cream, cheese in slices, and\r\nstrawberries; and, lastly, plums stewed in rose-water. Besides these four\r\ncourses, there was a fifth, entirely composed of the prepared wines then\r\nin vogue, and of preserves. These consisted of fruits and various sweet\r\npastries. The pastries represented stags and swans, to the necks of which\r\nwere suspended the arms of the Count of Anjou and those of the two young\r\nladies.\"\r\n\r\nIn great houses, dinner was announced by the sound of the hunting-horn;\r\nthis is what Froissard calls _corner l'assiette,_ but which was at an\r\nearlier period called _corner l'eau_, because it was the custom to wash\r\nthe hands before sitting down to table as well as on leaving the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.--Knife-handles in Sculptured Ivory, Sixteenth\r\nCentury (Collection of M. Becker, of Frankfort).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.--Nut-crackers, in Boxwood, Sixteenth Century\r\n(Collection of M. Achille Jubinal).]\r\n\r\nFor these ablutions scented water, and especially rose-water, was used,\r\nbrought in ewers of precious and delicately wrought metals, by pages or\r\nsquires, who handed them to the ladies in silver basins. It was at about\r\nthis period, that is, in the times of chivalry, that the custom of placing\r\nthe guests by couples was introduced, generally a gentleman and lady, each\r\ncouple having but one cup and one plate; hence the expression, to eat from\r\nthe same plate.\r\n\r\nHistorians relate that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, at\r\ncertain gala feasts, the dishes were brought in by servants in full\r\narmour, mounted on caparisoned horses; but this is a custom exclusively\r\nattached to chivalry. As early as those days, powerful and ingenious\r\nmachines were in use, which lowered from the story above, or raised from\r\nthat below, ready-served tables, which were made to disappear after use as\r\nif by enchantment.\r\n\r\nAt that period the table service of the wealthy required a considerable\r\nstaff of retainers and varlets; and, at a later period, this number was\r\nmuch increased. Thus, for instance, when Louis of Orleans went on a\r\ndiplomatic mission to Germany from his brother Charles VI., this prince,\r\nin order that France might be worthily represented abroad, raised the\r\nnumber of his household to more than two hundred and fifty persons, of\r\nwhom about one hundred were retainers and table attendants. Olivier de la\r\nMarche, who, in his \"Mémoires,\" gives the most minute details of the\r\nceremonial of the court of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, tells us\r\nthat the table service was as extensive as in the other great princely\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThis extravagant and ruinous pomp fell into disuse during the reigns of\r\nLouis XI., Charles VIII., and Louis XII., but reappeared in that of\r\nFrancis I. This prince, after his first wars in Italy, imported the\r\ncookery and the gastronomic luxury of that country, where the art of good\r\nliving, especially in Venice, Florence, and Rome, had reached the highest\r\ndegree of refinement and magnificence. Henry II. and Francis II.\r\nmaintained the magnificence of their royal tables; but after them,\r\nnotwithstanding the soft effeminacy of the manners at court, the continued\r\nwars which Henry III. and Charles IX. had to sustain in their own states\r\nagainst the Protestants and the League necessitated a considerable economy\r\nin the households and tables of those kings.\r\n\r\n\"It was only by fits and starts,\" says Brantôme, \"that one was well fed\r\nduring this reign, for very often circumstances prevented the proper\r\npreparation of the repasts; a thing much disliked by the courtiers, who\r\nprefer open table to be kept at both court and with the army, because it\r\nthen costs them nothing.\" Henry IV. was neither fastidious nor greedy; we\r\nmust therefore come down to the reign of Louis XIII. to find a vestige of\r\nthe splendour of the banquets of Francis I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.--Grand Ceremonial Banquet at the Court of France\r\nin the Fourteenth Century, archaeological Restoration from Miniatures and\r\nNarratives of the Period.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Dictionnaire du Mobilier Français\" of M. Viollet-Leduc.]\r\n\r\nFrom the establishment of the Franks in Gaul down to the fifteenth century\r\ninclusive, there were but two meals a day; people dined at ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning, and supped at four in the afternoon. In the sixteenth century\r\nthey put back dinner one hour and supper three hours, to which many people\r\nobjected. Hence the old proverb:--\r\n\r\n  \"Lever à six, dîner à dix,\r\n  Souper à six, coucher à dix,\r\n  Fait vivre l'homme dix fois dix.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"To rise at six, dine at ten,\r\n  Sup at six, to bed at ten,\r\n  Makes man live ten times ten.\")\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.--Banner of the Corporation of Pastrycooks of\r\nTonnerre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Venery and Hawking.--Origin of Aix-la-Chapelle.--Gaston Phoebus and his\r\n  Book.--The Presiding Deities of Sportsmen.--Sporting Societies and\r\n  Brotherhoods.--Sporting Kings: Charlemagne, Louis IX., Louis XI.,\r\n  Charles VIII., Louis XII., Francis I., &c.--Treatise on\r\n  Venery.--Sporting Popes.--Origin of Hawking.--Training Birds.--Hawking\r\n  Retinues.--Book of King Modus.--Technical Terms used in\r\n  Hawking.--Persons who have excelled in this kind of Sport.--Fowling.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the general term hunting is included the three distinct branches of an\r\nart, or it may be called a science, which dates its origin from the\r\nearliest times, but which was particularly esteemed in the Middle Ages,\r\nand was especially cultivated in the glorious days of chivalry.\r\n\r\n_Venery_, which is the earliest, is defined by M. Elzéar Blaze as \"the\r\nscience of snaring, taking, or killing one particular animal from amongst\r\na herd.\" _Hawking_ came next. This was not only the art of hunting with\r\nthe falcon, but that of training birds of prey to hunt feathered game.\r\nLastly, _l'oisellerie_ (fowling), which, according to the author of\r\nseveral well-known works on the subject we are discussing, had originally\r\nno other object than that of protecting the crops and fruits from birds\r\nand other animals whose nature it was to feed on them.\r\n\r\nVenery will be first considered. Sportsmen always pride themselves in\r\nplacing Xenophon, the general, philosopher, and historian, at the head of\r\nsporting writers, although his treatise on the chase (translated from the\r\nGreek into Latin under the title of \"De Venatione\"), which gives excellent\r\nadvice respecting the training of dogs, only speaks of traps and nets for\r\ncapturing wild animals. Amongst the Greeks Arrian and Oppian, and amongst\r\nthe Romans, Gratius Faliscus and Nemesianus, wrote on the same subject.\r\nTheir works, however, except in a few isolated or scattered passages, do\r\nnot contain anything about venery properly so called, and the first\r\nhistorical information on the subject is to be found in the records of the\r\nseventh century.\r\n\r\nLong after that period, however, they still hunted, as it were, at random,\r\nattacking the first animal they met. The sports of Charlemagne, for\r\ninstance, were almost always of this description. On some occasions they\r\nkilled animals of all sorts by thousands, after having tracked and driven\r\nthem into an enclosure composed of cloths or nets.\r\n\r\nThis illustrious Emperor, although usually at war in all parts of Europe,\r\nnever missed an opportunity of hunting: so much so that it might be said\r\nthat he rested himself by galloping through the forests. He was on these\r\noccasions not only followed by a large number of huntsmen and attendants\r\nof his household, but he was accompanied by his wife and daughters,\r\nmounted on magnificent coursers, and surrounded by a numerous and elegant\r\ncourt, who vied with each other in displaying their skill and courage in\r\nattacking the fiercest animals.\r\n\r\nIt is even stated that Aix-la-Chapelle owes its origin to a hunting\r\nadventure of Charlemagne. The Emperor one day while chasing a stag\r\nrequired to cross a brook which came in his path, but immediately his\r\nhorse had set his foot in the water he pulled it out again and began to\r\nlimp as if it were hurt. His noble rider dismounted, and on feeling the\r\nfoot found it was quite hot. This induced him to put his hand into the\r\nwater, which he found to be almost boiling. On that very spot therefore he\r\ncaused a chapel to be erected, in the shape of a horse's hoof. The town\r\nwas afterwards built, and to this day the spring of hot mineral water is\r\nenclosed under a rotunda, the shape of which reminds one of the old legend\r\nof Charlemagne and his horse.\r\n\r\nThe sons of Charlemagne also held hunting in much esteem, and by degrees\r\nthe art of venery was introduced and carried to great perfection. It was\r\nnot, however, until the end of the thirteenth century that an anonymous\r\nauthor conceived the idea of writing its principal precepts in an\r\ninstructive poem, called \"Le Dict de la Chace du Cerf.\" In 1328 another\r\nanonymous writer composed the \"Livre du Roy Modus,\" which contains the\r\nrules for hunting all furred animals, from the stag to the hare. Then\r\nfollowed other poets and writers of French prose, such as Gace de la Vigne\r\n(1359), Gaston Phoebus (1387), and Hardouin, lord of Fontaine-Guérin\r\n(1394). None of these, however, wrote exclusively on venery, but described\r\nthe different sports known in their day. Towards 1340, Alphonse XI., king\r\nof Castile, caused a book on hunting to be compiled for his use; but it\r\nwas not so popular as the instruction of Gaston Phoebus (Fig. 132). If\r\nhunting with hounds is known everywhere by the French name of the chase,\r\nit is because the honour of having organized it into a system, if not of\r\nhaving originated it, is due to the early French sporting authors, who\r\nwere able to form a code of rules for it. This also accounts for so many\r\nof the technical terms now in use in venery being of French origin, as\r\nthey are no others than those adopted by these ancient authors, whose\r\nworks, so to speak, have perpetuated them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.--Gaston Phoebus teaching the Art of\r\nVenery.--Fac-simile of a Miniature of \"Phoebus and his Staff for Hunting\r\nWild Animals and Birds of Prey\" (Manuscript, Fifteenth Century, National\r\nLibrary of Paris)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.--\"How to carry a Cloth to approach\r\nBeasts.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus\r\n(Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nThe curious miniatures which accompany the text in the original manuscript\r\nof Gaston Phoebus, and which have been reproduced in nearly all the\r\nancient copies of this celebrated manuscript, give most distinct and\r\ngraphic ideas of the various modes of hunting. We find, for instance, that\r\nthe use of an artificial cow for approaching wild-fowl was understood at\r\nthat time, the only difference being that a model was used more like a\r\nhorse than a cow (Fig. 133); we also see sportsmen shooting at bears, wild\r\nboars, stags, and such live animals with arrows having sharp iron points,\r\nintended to enter deep into the flesh, notwithstanding the thickness of\r\nthe fur and the creature's hard skin. In the case of the hare, however,\r\nthe missile had a heavy, massive end, probably made of lead, which stunned\r\nhim without piercing his body (Fig. 134). In other cases the sportsman is\r\nrepresented with a crossbow seated in a cart, all covered up with boughs,\r\nby which plan he was supposed to approach the prey without alarming it\r\nany more than a swinging branch would do (Fig. 135).\r\n\r\nGaston Phoebus is known to have been one of the bravest knights of his\r\ntime; and, after fighting, he considered hunting as his greatest delight.\r\nSomewhat ingenuously he writes of himself as a hunter, \"that he doubts\r\nhaving any superior.\" Like all his contemporaries, he is eloquent as to\r\nthe moral effect of his favourite pastime. \"By hunting,\" he says, \"one\r\navoids the sin of indolence; and, according to our faith, he who avoids\r\nthe seven mortal sins will be saved; therefore the good sportsman will be\r\nsaved.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.--\"How to allure the Hare.\"--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages sportsmen placed themselves under the protection of\r\nsome special deity. Among the Greeks and Romans it was Diana and Phoebe.\r\nThe Gauls, who had adopted the greater number of the gods and goddesses of\r\nRome, invoked the moon when they sallied forth to war or to the chase;\r\nbut, as soon as they penetrated the sacred obscurity of the forests, they\r\nappealed more particularly to the goddess _Ardhuina_, whose name, of\r\nunknown origin, has probably since been applied to the immense\r\nwell-stocked forests of Ardenne or Ardennes. They erected in the depths of\r\nthe woods monstrous stone figures in honour of this goddess, such as the\r\nheads of stags on the bodies of men or women; and, to propitiate her\r\nduring the chase, they hung round these idols the feet, the skins, and the\r\nhorns of the beasts they killed. Cernunnos, who was always represented\r\nwith a human head surmounted by stags' horns, had an altar even in\r\nLutetia, which was, no doubt, in consequence of the great woods which\r\nskirted the banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.--\"How to take a Cart to allure\r\nBeasts.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus\r\n(Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nThe Gallic Cernunnos, which we also find among the Romans, since Ovid\r\nmentions the votary stags' horns, continued to be worshipped to a certain\r\nextent after the establishment of the Christian religion. In the fifth\r\ncentury, Germain, an intrepid hunter, who afterwards became Bishop of\r\nAuxerre, possessed not far from his residence an oak of enormous diameter,\r\na thorough Cernunnos, which he hung with the skins and other portions of\r\nanimals he had killed in the chase. In some countries, where the Cernunnos\r\nremained an object of veneration, everybody bedecked it in the same way.\r\nThe largest oak to be found in the district was chosen on which to suspend\r\nthe trophies both of warriors and of hunters; and, at a more recent\r\nperiod, sportsmen used to hang outside their doors stags' heads, boars'\r\nfeet, birds of prey, and other trophies, a custom which evidently was a\r\nrelic of the one referred to.\r\n\r\nOn pagan idolatry being abandoned, hunters used to have a presiding\r\ngenius or protector, whom they selected from amongst the saints most in\r\nrenown. Some chose St. Germain d'Auxerre, who had himself been a\r\nsportsman; others St. Martin, who had been a soldier before he became\r\nBishop of Tours. Eventually they all agreed to place themselves under the\r\npatronage of St. Hubert, Bishop of Liège, a renowned hunter of the eighth\r\ncentury. This saint devoted himself to a religious life, after one day\r\nhaying encountered a miraculous stag whilst hunting in the woods, which\r\nappeared to him as bearing between his horns a luminous image of our\r\nSaviour. At first the feast of St. Hubert was celebrated four times a\r\nyear, namely, at the anniversaries of his conversion and death, and on the\r\ntwo occasions on which his relics were exhibited. At the celebration of\r\neach of these feasts a large number of sportsmen in \"fine apparel\" came\r\nfrom great distances with their horses and dogs. There was, in fact, no\r\nmagnificence or pomp deemed too imposing to be displayed, both by the\r\nkings and nobles, in honour of the patron-saint of hunting (Fig. 136).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.--\"How to shout and blow Horns.\"--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ladies Hunting\r\n\r\nCostumes of the fifteenth century. From a miniature in a ms. copy of\r\n_Ovid's Epistles_ No 7234 _bis._ Bibl. nat'le de Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.--German Sportsman, drawn and engraved by J.\r\nAmman in the Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nHunters and sportsmen in those days formed brotherhoods, which had their\r\nrank defined at public ceremonials, and especially in processions. In\r\n1455, Gérard, Duke of Cleves and Burgrave of Ravensberg, created the order\r\nof the Knights of St. Hubert, into which those of noble blood only were\r\nadmitted. The insignia consisted of a gold or silver chain formed of\r\nhunting horns, to which was hung a small likeness of the patron-saint in\r\nthe act of doing homage to our Saviour's image as it shone on the head of\r\na stag. It was popularly believed that the Knights of St. Hubert had the\r\npower of curing madness, which, for some unknown reason, never showed\r\nitself in a pack of hounds. This, however, was not the only superstitious\r\nbelief attached to the noble and adventurous occupations of the followers\r\nof St. Hubert. Amongst a number of old legends, which mostly belong to\r\nGermany (Fig. 137), mention is made of hunters who sold their souls to the\r\ndevil in exchange for some enchanted arrow which never missed its aim, and\r\nwhich reached game at extraordinary distances. Mention is also made in\r\nthese legends of various animals which, on being pursued by the hunters,\r\nwere miraculously saved by throwing themselves into the arms of some\r\nsaint, or by running into some holy sanctuary. There were besides knights\r\nwho, having hunted all their lives, believed that they were to continue\r\nthe same occupation in another world. An account is given in history of\r\nthe apparition of a fiery phantom to Charles IX. in the forest of Lyons,\r\nand also the ominous meeting of Henry IV. with the terrible _grand-veneur_\r\nin the forest of Fontainebleau. We may account for these strange tales\r\nfrom the fact that hunting formerly constituted a sort of freemasonry,\r\nwith its mysterious rites and its secret language. The initiated used\r\nparticular signs of recognition amongst themselves, and they also had\r\nlucky and unlucky numbers, emblematical colours, &c.\r\n\r\nThe more dangerous the sport the more it was indulged in by military men.\r\nThe Chronicles of the Monk of Saint-Gall describe an adventure which\r\nbefell Charlemagne on the occasion of his setting out with his huntsmen\r\nand hounds in order to chase an enormous bear which was the terror of the\r\nVosges. The bear, after having disabled numerous dogs and hunters, found\r\nhimself face to face with the Emperor, who alone dared to stand up before\r\nhim. A fierce combat ensued on the summit of a rock, in which both were\r\nlocked together in a fatal embrace. The contest ended by the death of the\r\nbear, Charles striking him with his dagger and hurling him down the\r\nprecipice. On this the hills resounded with the cry of \"Vive Charles le\r\nGrand!\" from the numerous huntsmen and others who had assembled; and it is\r\nsaid that this was the first occasion on which the companions of the\r\nintrepid monarch gave him the title of _Grand_ (Magnus), so from that time\r\nKing Charles became King _Charlemagne_.\r\n\r\nThis prince was most jealous of his rights of hunting, which he would\r\nwaive to no one. For a long time he refused permission to the monks of the\r\nAbbey of St. Denis, whom he nevertheless held in great esteem, to have\r\nsome stags killed which were destroying their forests. It was only on\r\ncondition that the flesh of these animals would serve as food to the monks\r\nof inferior order, and that their hides should be used for binding the\r\nmissals, that he eventually granted them permission to kill the offending\r\nanimals (Fig. 138).\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the ninth to the thirteenth century, we find that Louis\r\nIX., king of France, was as keen a sportsman and as brave a warrior as any\r\nof his ancestors. He was, indeed, as fond of hunting as of war, and during\r\nhis first crusade an opportunity occurred to him of hunting the lion. \"As\r\nsoon as he began to know the country of Cesarea,\" says Joinville, \"the\r\nKing set to work with his people to hunt lions, so that they captured\r\nmany; but in doing so they incurred great bodily danger. The mode of\r\ntaking them was this: They pursued them on the swiftest horses. When they\r\ncame near one they shot a bolt or arrow at him, and the animal, feeling\r\nhimself wounded, ran at the first person he could see, who immediately\r\nturned his horse's head and fled as fast as he could. During his flight he\r\ndropped a portion of his clothing, which the lion caught up and tore,\r\nthinking it was the person who had injured him; and whilst the lion was\r\nthus engaged the hunters again approached the infuriated animal and shot\r\nmore bolts and arrows at him. Soon the lion left the cloth and madly\r\nrushed at some other hunter, who adopted the same strategy as before. This\r\nwas repeated until the animal succumbed, becoming exhausted by the wounds\r\nhe had received.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.--\"Nature and Appearance of Deer, and how they can\r\nbe hunted with Dogs.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the \"Livre du Roy\r\nModus\"--Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century (National Library of Paris)]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the passion which this king had for hunting, he was the\r\nfirst to grant leave to the bourgeoisie to enjoy the sport. The condition\r\nhe made with them was that they should always give a haunch of any animal\r\nkilled to the lord of the soil. It is to this that we must trace the\r\norigin of giving the animal's foot to the huntsman or to the person who\r\nhas the lead of the hunting party.\r\n\r\nLouis XI., however, did not at all act in this liberal manner, and\r\nalthough it might have been supposed that the incessant wars and political\r\nintrigues in which he was constantly engaged would have given him no time\r\nfor amusements of this kind, yet he was, nevertheless, the keenest\r\nsportsman of his day. This tyrant of the Castle of Plessis-les-Tours, who\r\nwas always miserly, except in matters of hunting, in which he was most\r\nlavish, forbade even the higher classes to hunt under penalty of hanging.\r\nTo ensure the execution of his severe orders, he had all the castles as\r\nwell as the cottages searched, and any net, engine, or sporting arm found\r\nwas immediately destroyed. His only son, the heir to the throne, was not\r\nexempted from these laws. Shut up in the Castle of Amboise, he had no\r\npermission to leave it, for it was the will of the King that the young\r\nprince should remain ignorant of the noble exercises of chivalry. One day\r\nthe Dauphin prayed his governor, M. du Bouchage, with so much earnestness\r\nto give him an idea of hunting, that this noble consented to make an\r\nexcursion into the neighbouring wood with him. The King, however, managed\r\nto find it out, and Du Bouchage had great difficulty in keeping his head\r\non his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways of pleasing Louis XI. was to offer him some present\r\nrelating to his favourite pastime, either pointers, hounds, falcons, or\r\nvarlets who were adepts in the art of venery or hawking (Figs. 139 and\r\n140). When the cunning monarch became old and infirm, in order to make his\r\nenemies believe that he was still young and vigorous, he sent messengers\r\neverywhere, even to the most remote countries, to purchase horses, dogs,\r\nand falcons, for which, according to Comines, he paid large sums (Fig.\r\n141).\r\n\r\nOn his death, the young prince, Charles VIII., succeeded him, and he seems\r\nto have had an innate taste for hunting, and soon made up for lost time\r\nand the privation to which his father had subjected him. He hunted daily,\r\nand generously allowed the nobles to do the same. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto say that these were not slow in indulging in the privilege thus\r\nrestored to them, and which was one of their most ancient pastimes and\r\noccupations; for it must be remembered that, in those days of small\r\nintellectual culture, hunting must have been a great, if not at times the\r\nonly, resource against idleness and the monotony of country life.\r\n\r\nEverything which related to sport again became the fashion amongst the\r\nyouth of the nobility, and their chief occupation when not engaged in war.\r\nThey continued as formerly to invent every sort of sporting device. For\r\nexample, they obtained from other countries traps, engines, and\r\nhunting-weapons; they introduced into France at great expense foreign\r\nanimals, which they took great pains in naturalising as game or in\r\ntraining as auxiliaries in hunting. After having imported the reindeer\r\nfrom Lapland, which did not succeed in their temperate climate, and the\r\npheasant from Tartary, with which they stocked the woods, they imported\r\nwith greater success the panther and the leopard from Africa, which were\r\nused for furred game as the hawk was for feathered game. The mode of\r\nhunting with these animals was as follows: The sportsmen, preceded by\r\ntheir dogs, rode across country, each with a leopard sitting behind him on\r\nhis saddle. When the dogs had started the game the leopard jumped off the\r\nsaddle and sprang after it, and as soon as it was caught the hunters threw\r\nthe leopard a piece of raw flesh, for which he gave up the prey and\r\nremounted behind his master (Fig. 142)\r\n\r\nLouis XI., Charles VIII., and Louis XII. often hunted thus. The leopards,\r\nwhich formed a part of the royal venery, were kept in an enclosure of the\r\nCastle of Amboise, which still exists near the gate _des Lions_, so\r\ncalled, no doubt, on account of these sporting and carnivorous animals\r\nbeing mistaken for lions by the common people. There, were, however,\r\nalways lions in the menageries of the kings of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.--\"The Way to catch Squirrels on the Ground in the\r\nWoods\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the \"Livre du Roy\r\nModus\" (Fourteenth Century)]\r\n\r\nFrancis I. was quite as fond of hunting as any of his predecessors. His\r\ninnate taste for sport was increased during his travels in Italy, where he\r\nlived with princes who displayed great splendour in their hunting\r\nequipages. He even acquired the name of the _Father of Sportsmen_. His\r\n_netting_ establishment alone, consisted of one captain, one lieutenant,\r\ntwelve mounted huntsmen, six varlets to attend the bloodhounds; six\r\nwhips, who had under their charge sixty hounds; and one hundred bowmen on\r\nfoot, carrying large stakes for fixing the nets and tents, which were\r\ncarried by fifty six-horsed chariots. He was much pleased when ladies\r\nfollowed the chase; and amongst those who were most inclined to share its\r\npleasures, its toils, and even its perils, was Catherine de Medicis, then\r\nDauphine, who was distinguished for her agility and her graceful\r\nappearance on horseback, and who became a thorough sportswoman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.-\"The Way of catching Partridges with an Osier\r\nNet-Work Apparatus\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in \"Livre du Roy Modus.\"]\r\n\r\nThe taste for hunting having become very general, and the art being\r\nconsidered as the most noble occupation to which persons could devote\r\nthemselves, it is not surprising to find sporting works composed by\r\nwriters of the greatest renown and of the highest rank. The learned\r\nWilliam Budé, whom Erasmus called the _wonder of France_, dedicated to the\r\nchildren of Francis I. the second book of his \"Philologie,\" which contains\r\na treatise on stag-hunting. This treatise, originally written in Latin,\r\nwas afterwards translated into French by order of Charles IX., who was\r\nacknowledged to be one of the boldest and most scientific hunters of his\r\ntime. An extraordinary feat, which has never been imitated by any one, is\r\nrecorded of him, and that was, that alone, on horseback and without dogs,\r\nhe hunted down a stag. The \"Chasse Royale,\" the authorship of which is\r\nattributed to him, is replete with scientific information.\r\n\"Wolf-hunting,\" a work by the celebrated Clamorgan, and \"Yenery,\" by Du\r\nFouilloux, were dedicated to Charles IX., and a great number of special\r\ntreatises on such subjects appeared in his reign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.--\"Kennel in which Dogs should live, and how they\r\nshould be kept.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in Manuscript of Phoebus\r\n(Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nHis brother, the effeminate Henry III., disliked hunting, as he considered\r\nit too fatiguing and too dangerous.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, according to Sully, Henry IV., _le Béarnais_, who\r\nlearned hunting in early youth in the Pyrenees, \"loved all kinds of sport,\r\nand, above all, the most fatiguing and adventurous pursuits, such as those\r\nafter wolves, bears, and boars.\" He never missed a chance of hunting,\r\n\"even when in face of an enemy. If he knew a stag to be near, he found\r\ntime to hunt it,\" and we find in the \"Memoirs of Sully \" that the King\r\nhunted the day after the famous battle of Ivry.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he was only King of Navarre, he invited the ladies of Pau to\r\ncome and see a bear-hunt. Happily they refused, for on that occasion their\r\nnerves would have been put to a serious test. Two bears killed two of the\r\nhorses, and several bowmen were hugged to death by the ferocious animals.\r\nAnother bear, although pierced in several places, and having six or seven\r\npike-heads in his body, charged eight men who were stationed on the top of\r\na rock, and the whole of them with the bear were all dashed to pieces down\r\nthe precipice. The only point in which Louis XIII. resembled his father\r\nwas his love of the chase, for during his reign hunting continued in\r\nFrance, as well as in other countries, to be a favourite royal pastime.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked that St. Germain d'Auxerre, who at a certain period was\r\nthe patron of sportsmen, made hunting his habitual relaxation. He devoted\r\nhimself to it with great keenness in his youth, before he became bishop,\r\nthat is, when he was Duke of Auxerre and general of the troops of the\r\nprovinces. Subsequently, when against his will he was raised to the\r\nepiscopal dignity, not only did he give up all pleasures, but he devoted\r\nhimself to the strictest religious life. Unfortunately, in those days, all\r\nchurch-men did not understand, as he did, that the duties of their holy\r\nvocation were not consistent with these pastimes, for, in the year 507, we\r\nfind that councils and synods forbade priests to hunt. In spite of this,\r\nhowever, the ancient historians relate that several noble prelates,\r\nyielding to the customs of the times, indulged in hunting the stag and\r\nflying the falcon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--Hunting with the Leopard, from a Stamp of Jean\r\nStradan (Sixteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nIt is related in history that some of the most illustrious popes were also\r\ngreat lovers of the chase, namely, Julius II, Leo X., and, previously to\r\nthem, Pius II, who, before becoming Pope, amongst other literary and\r\nscientific works, wrote a Latin treatise on venery under his Christian\r\nnames, Æneas Silvius. It is easy to understand how it happened that sports\r\nformerly possessed such attractions for ecclesiastical dignitaries. In\r\nearly life they acquired the tastes and habits of people of their rank,\r\nand they were accordingly extremely jealous of the rights of chase in\r\ntheir domains. Although Pope Clement V., in his celebrated \"Institutions,\"\r\ncalled \"Clémentines,\" had formally forbidden the monks to hunt, there were\r\nfew who did not evade the canonical prohibition by pursuing furred game,\r\nand that without considering that they were violating the laws of the\r\nChurch. The papal edict permitted the monks and priests to hunt under\r\ncertain circumstances, and especially where rabbits or beasts of prey\r\nincreased so much as to damage the crops. It can easily be imagined that\r\nsuch would always be the case at a period when the people were so strictly\r\nforbidden to destroy game; and therefore hunting was practised at all\r\nseasons in the woods and fields in the vicinity of each abbey. The jealous\r\npeasants, not themselves having the right of hunting, and who continually\r\nsaw _Master Abbot_ passing on his hunting excursions, said, with malice,\r\nthat \"the monks never forgot to pray for the success of the litters and\r\nnests (_pro pullis et nidis_), in order that game might always be\r\nabundant.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--\"How Wolves may be caught with a\r\nSnare.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus (Fifteenth\r\nCentury).]\r\n\r\nIf venery, as a regular science, dates from a comparatively recent\r\nperiod, it is not so with falconry, the first traces of which are lost in\r\nobscure antiquity. This kind of sport, which had become a most learned and\r\ncomplicated art, was the delight of the nobles of the Middle Ages and\r\nduring the Renaissance period. It was in such esteem that a nobleman or\r\nhis lady never appeared in public without a hawk on the wrist as a mark of\r\ndignity (Fig. 147). Even bishops and abbots entered the churches with\r\ntheir hunting birds, which they placed on the steps of the altar itself\r\nduring the service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.--\"How Bears and other Beasts may be caught with a\r\nDart.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus (Fifteenth\r\nCentury).]\r\n\r\nThe bird, like the sword, was a distinctive mark which was inseparable\r\nfrom the person of gentle birth, who frequently even went to war with the\r\nfalcon on his wrist. During the battle he would make his squire hold the\r\nbird, which he replaced on his gauntlet when the fight was over. In fact,\r\nit was forbidden by the laws of chivalry for persons to give up their\r\nbirds, even as a ransom, should they be made prisoners; in which case they\r\nhad to let the noble birds fly, in order that they might not share their\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nThe falcon to a certain degree partook of his owner's nobility; he was,\r\nmoreover, considered a noble bird by the laws of falconry, as were all\r\nbirds of prey which could be trained for purposes of sport. All other\r\nbirds, without distinction, were declared _ignoble_, and no exception was\r\nmade to this rule by the naturalists of the Middle Ages, even in favour of\r\nthe strongest and most magnificent, such as the eagle and vulture.\r\nAccording to this capricious classification, they considered the\r\nsparrow-hawk, which was the smallest of the hunting-birds, to rank higher\r\nthan the eagle. The nickname of this diminutive sporting bird was often\r\napplied to a country-gentleman, who, not being able to afford to keep\r\nfalcons, used the sparrow-hawk to capture partridges and quail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.--Olifant, or Hunting-horn, in Ivory (Fourteenth\r\nCentury).--From an Original existing in England.]\r\n\r\nIt was customary for gentlemen of all classes, whether sportsmen or not,\r\nto possess birds of some kind, \"to keep up their rank,\" as the saying then\r\nwas. Only the richest nobles, however, were expected to keep a regular\r\nfalconry, that is, a collection of birds suited for taking all kinds of\r\ngame, such as the hare, the kite, the heron, &c., as each sport not only\r\nrequired special birds, but a particular and distinctive retinue and\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.--Details Hunting-horn of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury.--From the Original in an English Collection.]\r\n\r\nBesides the cost of falcons, which was often very great (for they were\r\nbrought from the most distant countries, such as Sweden, Iceland, Turkey,\r\nand Morocco), their rearing and training involved considerable outlay, as\r\nmay be more readily understood from the illustrations (Figs. 148 to 155),\r\nshowing some of the principal details of the long and difficult education\r\nwhich had to be given them.\r\n\r\nTo succeed in making the falcon obey the whistle, the voice, and the signs\r\nof the falconer was the highest aim of the art, and it was only by the\r\nexercise of much patience that the desired resuit was obtained. All birds\r\nof prey, when used for sport, received the generic name of _falcon_; and\r\namongst them were to be found the gerfalcon, the saker-hawk, the lanner,\r\nthe merlin, and the sparrow-hawk. The male birds were smaller than the\r\nfemales, and were called _tiercelet_--this name, however, more\r\nparticularly applied to the gosshawk or the largest kind of male hawk,\r\nwhereas the males of the above mentioned were called _laneret, sacret,\r\némouchet._ Generally the male birds were used for partridges and quail,\r\nand the female birds for the hare, the heron, and crane. _Oiseaux de\r\npoing_, or _hand-birds,_ was the name given to the gosshawk, common hawk,\r\nthe gerfalcon, and the merlin, because they returned to the hand of their\r\nmaster after having pursued game. The lanner, sparrow-hawk, and saker-hawk\r\nwere called _oiseaux de leure_, from the fact that it was always necessary\r\nto entice them back again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.--A Noble of Provence (Fifteenth\r\nCentury).--Bonnart's \"Costumes from the Tenth to the Sixteenth Century.\"]\r\n\r\nThe lure was an imitation of a bird, made of red cloth, that it might be\r\nmore easily seen from a distance. It was stuffed so that the falcon could\r\nsettle easily on it, and furnished with the wings of a partridge, duck, or\r\nheron, according to circumstances. The falconer swung his mock bird like a\r\nsling, and whistled as he did so, and the falcon, accustomed to find a\r\npiece of flesh attached to the lure, flew down in order to obtain it, and\r\nwas thus secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.--King Modus teaching the Art of\r\nFalconry.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy\r\nModus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nThe trainers of birds divided them into two kinds, namely, the _niais_ or\r\nsimple bird, which had been taken from the nest, and the wild bird\r\n(_hagard_) captured when full-grown. The education of the former was\r\nnaturally very much the easier, but they succeeded in taming both classes,\r\nand even the most rebellious were at last subdued by depriving them of\r\nsleep, by keeping away the light from them, by coaxing them with the\r\nvoice, by patting them, by giving them choice food, &c.\r\n\r\nRegardless of his original habits, the bird was first accustomed to have\r\nno fear of men, horses, and dogs. He was afterwards fastened to a string\r\nby one leg, and, being allowed to fly a short distance, was recalled to\r\nthe lure, where he always found a dainty bit of food. After he had been\r\nthus exercised for several months, a wounded partridge was let loose that\r\nhe might catch it near the falconer, who immediately took it from him\r\nbefore he could tear it to pieces. When he appeared sufficiently tame, a\r\nquail or partridge, previously stripped of a few feathers so as to prevent\r\nit flying properly, was put in his way as before. If he was wanted for\r\nhunting hares, a stuffed hare was dragged before him, inside of which was\r\na live chicken, whose head and liver was his reward if he did his work\r\nwell. Then they tried him with a hare whose fore-leg was broken in order\r\nto ensure his being quickly caught. For the kite, they placed two hawks\r\ntogether on the same perch, so as to accustom them peaceably to live and\r\nhunt together, for if they fought with one another, as strange birds were\r\napt to do, instead of attacking the kite, the sport would of course have\r\nfailed. At first a hen of the colour of a kite was given them to fight\r\nwith. When they had mastered this, a real kite was used, which was tied to\r\na string and his claws and beak were filed so as to prevent him from\r\nwounding the young untrained falcons. The moment they had secured their\r\nprey, they were called off it and given chickens' flesh to eat on the\r\nlure. The same System was adopted for hunting the heron or crane (Fig.\r\n159).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.--Falconers dressing their Birds.--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, in order to train birds, it was necessary for a\r\nlarge number of the various kinds of game to be kept on the premises, and\r\nfor each branch of sport a regular establishment was required. In\r\nfalconry, as in venery, great care was taken to secure that a bird should\r\ncontinue at one object of prey until he had secured it, that is to say, it\r\nwas most essential to teach it not to leave the game he was after in order\r\nto pursue another which might come in his way.\r\n\r\nTo establish a falconry, therefore, not only was a very large poultry-yard\r\nrequired, but also a considerable staff of huntsmen, falconers, and whips,\r\nbesides a number of horses and dogs of all sorts, which were either used\r\nfor starting the game for the hawks, or for running it down when it was\r\nforced to ground by the birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.--Varlets of Falconry.--Fac-simile of a Miniature\r\nin the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nA well-trained falcon was a bird of great value, and was the finest\r\npresent that could be made to a lady, to a nobleman, or to the King\r\nhimself, by any one who had received a favour. For instance, the King of\r\nFrance received six birds from the Abbot of St. Hubert as a token of\r\ngratitude for the protection granted by him to the abbey. The King of\r\nDenmark sent him several as a gracious offering in the month of April; the\r\nGrand Master of Malta in the month of May. At court, in those days, the\r\nreception of falcons either in public or in private was a great business,\r\nand the first trial of any new birds formed a topic of conversation among\r\nthe courtiers for some time after.\r\n\r\nThe arrival at court of a hawk-dealer from some distant country was also a\r\ngreat event. It is said that Louis XI. gave orders that watch should be\r\nkept night and day to seize any falcons consigned to the Duke of Brittany\r\nfrom Turkey. The plan succeeded, and the birds thus stolen were brought\r\nto the King, who exclaimed, \"By our holy Lady of Cléry! what will the Duke\r\nFrancis and his Bretons do? They will be very angry at the good trick I\r\nhave played them.\"\r\n\r\nEuropean princes vied with each other in extravagance as regards falconry;\r\nbut this was nothing in comparison to the magnificence displayed in\r\noriental establishments. The Count de Nevers, son of Philip the Bold, Duke\r\nof Burgundy, having been made prisoner at the battle of Nicopolis, was\r\npresented to the Sultan Bajazet, who showed him his hunting establishment\r\nconsisting of seven thousand falconers and as many huntsmen. The Duke of\r\nBurgundy, on hearing this, sent twelve white hawks, which were very scarce\r\nbirds, as a present to Bajazet. The Sultan was so pleased with them that\r\nhe sent him back his son in exchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--\"How to train a New Falcon.\"--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Livre du Roy Modus\" gives the most minute and curious details on the\r\nnoble science of hawking. For instance, it tells us that the _nobility_ of\r\nthe falcon was held in such respect that their utensils, trappings, or\r\nfeeding-dishes were never used for other birds. The glove on which they\r\nwere accustomed to alight was frequently elaborately embroidered in gold,\r\nand was never used except for birds of their own species. In the private\r\nestablishments the leather hoods, which were put on their heads to prevent\r\nthem seeing, were embroidered with gold and pearls and surmounted with the\r\nfeathers of birds of paradise. Each bird wore on his legs two little bells\r\nwith his owner's crest upon them; the noise made by these was very\r\ndistinct, and could be heard even when the bird was too high in the air\r\nto be seen, for they were not made to sound in unison; they generally came\r\nfrom Italy, Milan especially being celebrated for their manufacture.\r\nStraps were also fastened to the falcon's legs, by means of which he was\r\nattached to the perch; at the end of this strap was a brass or gold ring\r\nwith the owner's name engraved upon it. In the royal establishments each\r\nring bore on one side, \"I belong to the king,\" and on the other the name\r\nof the Grand Falconer. This was a necessary precaution, for the birds\r\nfrequently strayed, and, if captured, they could thus be recognised and\r\nreturned. The ownership of a falcon was considered sacred, and, by an\r\nancient barbaric law, the stealer of a falcon was condemned to a very\r\ncurious punishment. The unfortunate thief was obliged to allow the falcon\r\nto eat six ounces of the flesh of his breast, unless he could pay a heavy\r\nfine to the owner and another to the king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--Falconers.--Fac-simile from a Miniature in\r\nManuscript of the Thirteenth Century, which treats of the \"Cour de Jaime,\r\nRoi de Maiorque.\"]\r\n\r\nA man thoroughly acquainted with the mode of training hawks was in high\r\nesteem everywhere. If he was a freeman, the nobles outbid each other as to\r\nwho should secure his services; if he was a serf, his master kept him as a\r\nrare treasure, only parted with him as a most magnificent present, or sold\r\nhim for a considerable sum. Like the clever huntsman, a good falconer\r\n(Fig. 156) was bound to be a man of varied information on natural history,\r\nthe veterinary art, and the chase; but the profession generally ran in\r\nfamilies, and the son added his own experience to the lessons of his\r\nfather. There were also special schools of venery and falconry, the most\r\nrenowned being of course in the royal household.\r\n\r\nThe office of Grand Falconer of France, the origin of which dates from\r\n1250, was one of the highest in the kingdom. The Maréchal de Fleuranges\r\nsays, in his curious \"Memoirs\"--\"The Grand Falconer, whose salary is four\r\nthousand florins\" (the golden florin was worth then twelve or fifteen\r\nfrancs, and this amount must represent upwards of eighty thousand francs\r\nof present currency), \"has fifty gentlemen under him, the salary of each\r\nbeing from five to six thousand livres. He has also fifty assistant\r\nfalconers at two hundred livres each, all chosen by himself. His\r\nestablishment consists of three hundred birds; he has the right to hunt\r\nwherever he pleases in the kingdom; he levies a tax on all bird-dealers,\r\nwho are forbidden, under penalty of the confiscation of their stock, from\r\nselling a single bird in any town or at court without his sanction.\" The\r\nGrand Falconer was chief at all the hunts or hawking meetings; in public\r\nceremonies he always appeared with the bird on his wrist, as an emblem of\r\nhis rank; and the King, whilst hawking, could not let loose his bird until\r\nafter the Grand Falconer had slipped his.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--\"How to bathe a New Falcon.\"--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nFalconry, like venery, had a distinctive and professional vocabulary,\r\nwhich it was necessary for every one who joined in hawking to understand,\r\nunless he wished to be looked upon as an ignorant yeoman. \"Flying the hawk\r\nis a royal pastime,\" says the Jesuit Claude Binet, \"and it is to talk\r\nroyally to talk of the flight of birds. Every one speaks of it, but few\r\nspeak well. Many speak so ignorantly as to excite pity among their\r\nhearers. Sometimes one says the _hand_ of the bird instead of saying the\r\n_talon_, sometimes the _talon_ instead of the _claw_, sometimes the _claw_\r\ninstead of the _nail_\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century was the great epoch of falconry. There were then so\r\nmany nobles who hawked, that in the rooms of inns there were perches made\r\nunder the large mantel-pieces on which to place the birds while the\r\nsportsmen were at dinner. Histories of the period are full of\r\ncharacteristic anecdotes, which prove the enthusiasm which was created by\r\nhawking in those who devoted themselves to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.--\"How to make Young Hawks fly.\"--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nEmperors and kings were as keen as others for this kind of sport. As early\r\nas the tenth century the Emperor Henry I. had acquired the soubriquet of\r\n\"the Bird-catcher,\" from the fact of his giving much more attention to his\r\nbirds than to his subjects. His example was followed by one of his\r\nsuccessors, the Emperor Henry VI., who was reckoned the first falconer of\r\nhis time. When his father, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (Red-beard),\r\ndied in the Holy Land, in 1189, the Archdukes, Electors of the Empire,\r\nwent out to meet the prince so as to proclaim him Emperor of Germany. They\r\nfound him, surrounded by dogs, horses, and birds, ready to go hunting.\r\n\"The day is fine,\" he said; \"allow us to put off serious affairs until\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nTwo centuries later we find at the court of France the same ardour for\r\nhawking and the same admiration for the performances of falcons. The\r\nConstable Bertrand du Guesclin gave two hawks to King Charles VI.; and\r\nthe Count de Tancarville, whilst witnessing a combat between these noble\r\nbirds and a crane which had been powerful enough to keep two greyhounds at\r\nbay, exclaimed, \"I would not give up the pleasure which I feel for a\r\nthousand florins!\"\r\n\r\nThe court-poet, William Crétin, although he was Canon of the holy chapel\r\nof Vincennes, was as passionately fond of hawking as his good master Louis\r\nXII. He thus describes the pleasure he felt in seeing a heron succumb to\r\nthe vigorous attack of the falcons:--\r\n\r\n  \"Qui auroit la mort aux dents,\r\n  Il revivroit d'avour un tel passe-temps!\"\r\n\r\n  (\"He who is about to die\r\n  Would live again with such amusement.\")\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Lady setting out Hawking.--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the Manuscript of \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth.\r\nCentury).]\r\n\r\nAt a hunting party given by Louis XII. to the Archduke Maximilian, Mary of\r\nBurgundy, the Archduke's wife, was killed by a fall from her horse. The\r\nKing presented his best falcons to the Archduke with a view to divert his\r\nmind and to turn his attention from the sad event, and one of the\r\nhistorians tells us that the bereaved husband was soon consoled: \"The\r\npartridges, herons, wild ducks, and quails which he was enabled to take on\r\nhis journey home by means of the King's present, materially lessening his\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\nFalconry, after having been in much esteem for centuries, at last became\r\namenable to the same law which affects all great institutions, and, having\r\nreached the height of its glory, it was destined to decay. Although the\r\nart disappeared completely under Louis the Great, who only liked\r\nstag-kunting, and who, by drawing all the nobility to court, disorganized\r\ncountry life, no greater adept had ever been known than King Louis XIII.\r\nHis first favourite and Grand Falconer was Albert de Luynes, whom he made\r\nprime minister and constable. Even in the Tuileries gardens, on his way to\r\nmass at the convent of the Feuillants, this prince amused himself by\r\ncatching linnets and wrens with noisy magpies trained to pursue small\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nIt was during this reign that some ingenious person discovered that the\r\nwords LOUIS TREIZIÈME, ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE, exactly gave this\r\nanagram, ROY TRÈS-RARE, ESTIMÉ DIEU DE LA FAUCONNERIE. It was also at this\r\ntime that Charles d'Arcussia, the last author who wrote a technical work\r\non falconry, after praising his majesty for devoting himself so thoroughly\r\nto the divine sport, compared the King's birds to domestic angels, and the\r\ncarnivorous birds which they destroyed he likened to the devil. From this\r\nhe argued that the sport was like the angel Gabriel destroying the demon\r\nAsmodeus. He also added, in his dedication to the King, \"As the nature of\r\nangels is above that of men, so is that of these birds above all other\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Dress of the Falconer (Thirteenth\r\nCentury).--Sculpture of the Cathedral of Rouen.]\r\n\r\nAt that time certain religious or rather superstitious ceremonies were in\r\nuse for blessing the water with which the falcons were sprinkled before\r\nhunting, and supplications were addressed to the eagles that they might\r\nnot molest them. The following words were used: \"I adjure you, O eagles!\r\nby the true God, by the holy God, by the most blessed Virgin Mary, by the\r\nnine orders of angels, by the holy prophets, by the twelve apostles,\r\n&c.... to leave the field clear to our birds, and not to molest them: in\r\nthe name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" It was at\r\nthis time that, in order to recover a lost bird, the Sire de la\r\nBrizardière, a professional necromancer, proposed beating the owner of the\r\nbird with birch-rods until he bled, and of making a charm with the blood,\r\nwhich was reckoned infallible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--Diseases of Dogs and their Cure.--Fac-simile of\r\na Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nElzéar Blaze expressed his astonishment that the ladies should not have\r\nused their influence to prevent falconry from falling into disuse. The\r\nchase, he considered, gave them an active part in an interesting and\r\nanimated scene, which only required easy and graceful movements on their\r\npart, and to which no danger was attached. \"The ladies knowing,\" he says,\r\n\"how to fly a bird, how to call him back, and how to encourage him with\r\ntheir voice, being familiar with him from having continually carried him\r\non their wrist, and often even from having broken him in themselves, the\r\nhonour of hunting belongs to them by right. Besides, it brings out to\r\nadvantage their grace and dexterity as they gallop amongst the sportsmen,\r\nfollowed by their pages and varlets and a whole herd of horses and dogs.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of precedence and of superiority had, at every period, been\r\npretty evenly balanced between venery and falconry, each having its own\r\nstaunch supporters. Thus, in the \"Livre du Roy Modus,\" two ladies contend\r\nin verse (for the subject was considered too exalted to be treated of in\r\nsimple prose), the one for the superiority of the birds, the other for the\r\nsuperiority of dogs. Their controversy is at length terminated by a\r\ncelebrated huntsman and falconer, who decides in favour of venery, for the\r\nsomewhat remarkable reason that those who pursue it enjoy oral and ocular\r\npleasure at the same time. In an ancient Treatise by Gace de la Vigne, in\r\nwhich the same question occupies no fewer than ten thousand verses, the\r\nKing (unnamed) ends the dispute by ordering that in future they shall be\r\ntermed pleasures of dogs and pleasures of birds, so that there may be no\r\nsuperiority on one side or the other (Fig. 160). The court-poet, William\r\nCrétin, who was in great renown during the reigns of Louis XII. and\r\nFrancis I., having asked two ladies to discuss the same subject in verse,\r\ndoes not hesitate, on the contrary, to place falconry above venery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--German Falconer, designed and engraved, in the\r\nSixteenth Century, by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be asserted that venery and falconry have taken a position\r\nof some importance in history; and in support of this theory it will\r\nsuffice to mention a few facts borrowed from the annals of the chase.\r\n\r\nThe King of Navarre, Charles the Bad, had sworn to be faithful to the\r\nalliance made between himself and King Edward III. of England; but the\r\nEnglish troops having been beaten by Du Guesclin, Charles saw that it was\r\nto his advantage to turn to the side of the King of France. In order not\r\nto appear to break his oath, he managed to be taken prisoner by the French\r\nwhilst out hunting, and thus he sacrificed his honour to his personal\r\ninterests. It was also due to a hunting party that Henry III., another\r\nKing of Navarre, who was afterwards Henry IV., escaped from Paris, on the\r\n3rd February, 1576, and fled to Senlis, where his friends of the Reformed\r\nreligion came to join him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.--Heron-hawking.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the\r\nManuscript of the \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nHunting formed a principal entertainment when public festivals were\r\ncelebrated, and it was frequently accompanied with great magnificence. At\r\nthe entry of Isabel of Bavaria into Paris, a sort of stag hunt was\r\nperformed, when \"the streets,\" according to a popular story of the time,\r\n\"were full to profusion of hares, rabbits, and goslings.\" Again, at the\r\nsolemn entry of Louis XI. into Paris, a representation of a doe hunt took\r\nplace near the fountain St. Innocent; \"after which the queen received a\r\npresent of a magnificent stag, made of confectionery, and having the royal\r\narms hung round its neck.\" At the memorable festival given at Lille, in\r\n1453, by the Duke of Burgundy, a very curious performance took place. \"At\r\none end of the table,\" says the historian Mathieu de Coucy, \"a heron was\r\nstarted, which was hunted as if by falconers and sportsmen; and presently\r\nfrom the other end of the table a falcon was slipped, which hovered over\r\nthe heron. In a few minutes another falcon was started from the other side\r\nof the table, which attacked the heron so fiercely that he brought him\r\ndown in the middle of the hall. After the performance was over and the\r\nheron was killed, it was served up at the dinner-table.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--Sport with Dogs.--\"How the Wild Boar is hunted\r\nby means of Dogs.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the\r\n\"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this chapter with a few words on bird-fowling, a kind of\r\nsport which was almost disdained in the Middle Ages. The anonymous author\r\nof the \"Livre du Roy Modus\" called it, in the fourteenth century, the\r\npastime of the poor, \"because the poor, who can neither keep hounds nor\r\nfalcons to hunt or to fly, take much pleasure in it, particularly as it\r\nserves at the same time as a means of subsistence to many of them.\"\r\n\r\nIn this book, which was for a long time the authority in matters of sport\r\ngenerally, we find that nearly all the methods and contrivances now\r\nemployed for bird-fowling were known and in use in the Middle Ages, in\r\naddition to some which have since fallen into disuse. We accordingly read\r\nin the \"Roy Modus\" a description of the drag-net, the mirror, the\r\nscreech-owl, the bird-pipe (Fig. 161), the traps, the springs, &c., the\r\nuse of all of which is now well understood. At that time, when falcons\r\nwere so much required, it was necessary that people should be employed to\r\ncatch them when young; and the author of this book speaks of nets of\r\nvarious sorts, and the pronged piece of wood in the middle of which a\r\nscreech-owl or some other bird was placed in order to attract the falcons\r\n(Fig. 162).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--Bird-piping.--\"The Manner of Catching Birds by\r\npiping.\"--Fac-simile of Miniature in the Manuscript of the \"Livre du Roy\r\nModus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nTwo methods were in use in those days for catching the woodcook and\r\npheasant, which deserve to be mentioned. \"The pheasants,\" says \"King\r\nModus,\" \"are of such a nature that the male bird cannot bear the company\r\nof another.\" Taking advantage of this weakness, the plan of placing a\r\nmirror, which balanced a sort of wicker cage or coop, was adopted. The\r\npheasant, thinking he saw his fellow, attacked him, struck against the\r\nglass and brought down the coop, in which he had leisure to reflect on his\r\njealousy (Fig. 163).\r\n\r\nWoodcocks, which are, says the author, \"the most silly birds,\" were caught\r\nin this way. The bird-fowler was covered from head to foot with clothes of\r\nthe colour of dead leaves, only having two little holes for his eyes. When\r\nhe saw one he knelt down noiselessly, and supported his arms on two\r\nsticks, so as to keep perfectly still. When the bird was not looking\r\ntowards him he cautiously approached it on his knees, holding in his hands\r\ntwo little dry sticks covered with red cloth, which he gently waved so as\r\nto divert the bird's attention from himself. In this way he gradually got\r\nnear enough to pass a noose, which he kept ready at the end of a stick,\r\nround the bird's neck (Fig. 164).\r\n\r\nHowever ingenious these tricks may appear, they are eclipsed by one we\r\nfind recorded in the \"Ixeuticon,\" a very elegant Latin poem, by Angelis de\r\nBarga, written two centuries later. In order to catch a large number of\r\nstarlings, this author assures us, it is only necessary to have two or\r\nthree in a cage, and, when a flight of these birds is seen passing, to\r\nliberate them with a very long twine attached to their claws. The twine\r\nmust be covered with bird-lime, and, as the released birds instantly join\r\ntheir friends, all those they come near get glued to the twine and fall\r\ntogether to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--Bird-catching with a Machine like a Long\r\nArm.--Fac-simile of Miniature in the Manuscript of the \"Livre du Roy\r\nModus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nAs at the present time, the object of bird-fowling was twofold, namely, to\r\nprocure game for food and to capture birds to be kept either for their\r\nvoice or for fancy as pets. The trade in the latter was so important, at\r\nleast in Paris, that the bird-catchers formed a numerous corporation\r\nhaving its statutes and privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Pont au Change (then covered on each side with houses and shops\r\noccupied by goldsmiths and money-changers) was the place where these\r\npeople carried on their trade; and they had the privilege of hanging\r\ntheir cages against the houses, even without the sanction of the\r\nproprietors. This curious right was granted to them by Charles VI. in\r\n1402, in return for which they were bound to \"provide four hundred birds\"\r\nwhenever a king was crowned, \"and an equal number when the queen made her\r\nfirst entry into her good town of Paris.\" The goldsmiths and\r\nmoney-changers, however, finding that this became a nuisance, and that it\r\ninjured their trade, tried to get it abolished. They applied to the\r\nauthorities to protect their rights, urging that the approaches to their\r\nshops, the rents of which they paid regularly, were continually obstructed\r\nby a crowd of purchasers and dealers in birds. The case was brought\r\nseveral times before parliament, which only confirmed the orders of the\r\nkings of France and the ancient privileges of the bird-catchers. At the\r\nend of the sixteenth century the quarrel became so bitter that the\r\ngoldsmiths and changers took to \"throwing down the cages and birds and\r\ntrampling them under foot,\" and even assaulted and openly ill-treated the\r\npoor bird-dealers. But a degree of parliament again justified the sale of\r\nbirds on the Pont an Change, by condemning the ring-leader,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--Pheasant Fowling.--\"Showing how to catch\r\nPheasants.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the \"Livre du\r\nRoy Modus\" (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nPierre Filacier, the master goldsmith who had commenced the proceedings\r\nagainst the bird-catchers, to pay a double fine, namely, twenty crowns to\r\nthe plaintiffs and ten to the King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--The Mode of catching a Woodcock.--Fac-simile of\r\na Miniature in the Manuscript of the \"Livre du Roy Modus\" (Fourteenth\r\nCentury).]\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to observe that at that period measures were taken to\r\npreserve nests and to prevent bird-fowling from the 15th of March to the\r\n15th of August. Besides this, it was necessary to have an express\r\npermission from the King himself to give persons the right of catching\r\nbirds on the King's domains. Before any one could sell birds it was\r\nrequired for him to have been received as a master bird-catcher. The\r\nrecognised bird-catchers, therefore, had no opponents except dealers from\r\nother countries, who brought canary-birds, parrots, and other foreign\r\nspecimens into Paris. These dealers were, however, obliged to conform to\r\nstrict rules. They were required on their arrival to exhibit their birds\r\nfrom ten to twelve o'clock on the marble stone in the palace yard on the\r\ndays when parliament sat, in order that the masters and governors of the\r\nKing's aviary, and, after them, the presidents and councillors, might have\r\nthe first choice before other people of anything they wished to buy. They\r\nwere, besides, bound to part the male and female birds in separate cages\r\nwith tickets on them, so that purchasers might not be deceived; and, in\r\ncase of dispute on this point, some sworn inspectors were appointed as\r\narbitrators.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, emboldened by the victory which they had achieved over the\r\ngoldsmiths of the Pont an Change, the bird-dealers of Paris attempted to\r\nforbid any bourgeois of the town from breeding canaries or any sort of\r\ncage birds. The bourgeois resented this, and brought their case before the\r\nMarshals of France. They urged that it was easy for them to breed\r\ncanaries, and it was also a pleasure for their wives and daughters to\r\nteach them, whereas those bought on the Pont an Change were old and\r\ndifficult to educate. This appeal was favourably received, and an order\r\nfrom the tribunal of the Marshals of France permitted the bourgeois to\r\nbreed canaries, but it forbade the sale of them, which it was considered\r\nwould interfere with the trade of the master-fowlers of the town,\r\nfaubourgs, and suburbs of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--Powder-horn.--Work of the Sixteenth Century\r\n(Artillery Museum of Brussels).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGames and Pastimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Games of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.--Games of the Circus.--Animal\r\n  Combats.--Daring of King Pepin.--The King's Lions.--Blind Men's\r\n  Fights.--Cockneys of Paris.--Champ de Mars.--Cours Plénières and Cours\r\n  Couronnées.--Jugglers, Tumblers, and\r\n  Minstrels.--Rope-dancers.--Fireworks.--Gymnastics.--Cards and\r\n  Dice.--Chess, Marbles, and Billiards.--La Soule, La Pirouette,\r\n  &c.--Small Games for Private Society.--History of Dancing.--Ballet des\r\n  Ardents.--The \"Orchésographie\" (Art of Dancing) of Thoinot Arbeau.--List\r\n  of Dances.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople of all countries and at all periods have been fond of public\r\namusements, and have indulged in games and pastimes with a view to make\r\ntime pass agreeably. These amusements have continually varied, according\r\nto the character of each nation, and according to the capricious changes\r\nof fashion. Since the learned antiquarian, J. Meursius, has devoted a\r\nlarge volume to describing the games of the ancient Greeks (\"De Ludis\r\nGraecorum\"), and Rabelais has collected a list of two hundred and twenty\r\ngames which were in fashion at different times at the court of his gay\r\nmaster, it will be easily understood that a description of all the games\r\nand pastimes which have ever been in use by different nations, and\r\nparticularly by the French, would form an encyclopaedia of some size.\r\n\r\nWe shall give a rapid sketch of the different kinds of games and pastimes\r\nwhich were most in fashion during the Middle Ages and to the end of the\r\nsixteenth century--omitting, however, the religious festivals, which\r\nbelong to a different category; the public festivals, which will come\r\nunder the chapter on Ceremonials; the tournaments and tilting matches and\r\nother sports of warriors, which belong to Chivalry; and, lastly, the\r\nscenic and literary representations, which specially belong to the history\r\nof the stage.\r\n\r\nWe shall, therefore, limit ourselves here to giving in a condensed form a\r\nfew historical details of certain court amusements, and a short\r\ndescription of the games of skill and of chance, and also of dancing.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, especially during the times of the emperors, had a passionate\r\nlove for performances in the circus and amphitheatre, as well as for\r\nchariot races, horse races, foot races, combats of animals, and feats of\r\nstrength and agility. The daily life of the Roman people may be summed up\r\nas consisting of taking their food and enjoying games in the circus\r\n(_panem et circenses_). A taste for similar amusements was common to the\r\nGauls as well as to the whole Roman Empire; and, were historians silent on\r\nthe subject, we need no further information than that which is to be\r\ngathered from the ruins of the numerous amphitheatres, which are to be\r\nfound at every centre of Roman occupation. The circus disappeared on the\r\nestablishment of the Christian religion, for the bishops condemned it as a\r\nprofane and sanguinary vestige of Paganism, and, no doubt, this led to the\r\ncessation of combats between man and beast. They continued, however, to\r\npit wild or savage animals against one another, and to train dogs to fight\r\nwith lions, tigers, bears, and bulls; otherwise it would be difficult to\r\nexplain the restoration by King Chilpéric (A.D. 577) of the circuses and\r\narenas at Paris and Soissons. The remains of one of these circuses was not\r\nlong ago discovered in Paris whilst they were engaged in laying the\r\nfoundations for a new street, on the west side of the hill of St.\r\nGeneviève, a short distance from the old palace of the Caesars, known by\r\nthe name of the Thermes of Julian.\r\n\r\nGregory of Tours states that Chilpéric revived the ancient games of the\r\ncircus, but that Gaul had ceased to be famous for good athletes and\r\nrace-horses, although animal combats continued to take place for the\r\namusement of the kings. One day King Pepin halted, with the principal\r\nofficers of his army, at the Abbey of Ferrières, and witnessed a fight\r\nbetween a lion and a bull. The bull was of enormous size and extraordinary\r\nstrength, but nevertheless the lion overcame him; whereupon Pepin, who was\r\nsurnamed the Short, turned to his officers, who used to joke him about his\r\nshort stature, and said to them, \"Make the lion loose his hold of the\r\nbull, or kill him.\" No one dared to undertake so perilous a task, and some\r\nsaid aloud that the man who would measure his strength with a lion must be\r\nmad. Upon this, Pepin sprang into the arena sword in hand, and with two\r\nblows cut off the heads of the lion and the bull. \"What do you think of\r\nthat?\" he said to his astonished officers. \"Am I not fit to be your\r\nmaster? Size cannot compare with courage. Remember what little David did\r\nto the Giant Goliath.\"\r\n\r\nEight hundred years later there were occasional animal combats at the\r\ncourt of Francis I. \"A fine lady,\" says Brantôme, \"went to see the King's\r\nlions, in company with a gentleman who much admired her. She suddenly let\r\nher glove drop, and it fell into the lions' den. 'I beg of you,' she said,\r\nin the calmest way, to her admirer, 'to go amongst the lions and bring me\r\nback my glove.' The gentleman made no remark, but, without even drawing\r\nhis sword, went into the den and gave himself up silently to death to\r\nplease the lady. The lions did not move, and he was able to leave their\r\nden without a scratch and return the lady her missing glove. 'Here is your\r\nglove, madam,' he coldly said to her who evidently valued his life at so\r\nsmall a price; 'see if you can find any one else who would do the same as\r\nI have done for you.' So saying he left her, and never afterwards looked\r\nat or even spoke to her.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been imagined that the kings of France only kept lions as living\r\nsymbols of royalty. In 1333 Philippe de Valois bought a barn in the Rue\r\nFroidmantel, near the Château du Louvre, where he established a menagerie\r\nfor his lions, bears, leopards, and other wild beasts. This royal\r\nmenagerie still existed in the reigns of Charles VIII. and Francis I.\r\nCharles V. and his successors had an establishment of lions in the\r\nquadrangle of the Grand Hôtel de St. Paul, on the very spot which was\r\nsubsequently the site of the Rue des Lions St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThese wild beasts were sometimes employed in the combats, and were pitted\r\nagainst bulls and dogs in the presence of the King and his court. It was\r\nafter one of these combats that Charles IX., excited by the sanguinary\r\nspectacle, wished to enter the arena alone in order to attack a lion which\r\nhad torn some of his best dogs to pieces, and it was only with great\r\ndifficulty that the audacious sovereign was dissuaded from his foolish\r\npurpose. Henry III. had no disposition to imitate his brother's example;\r\nfor dreaming one night that his lions were devouring him, he had them all\r\nkilled the next day.\r\n\r\nThe love for hunting wild animals, such as the wolf, bear, and boar (see\r\nchapter on Hunting), from an early date took the place of the animal\r\ncombats as far as the court and the nobles were concerned. The people were\r\ntherefore deprived of the spectacle of the combats which had had so much\r\ncharm for them; and as they could not resort to the alternative of the\r\nchase, they treated themselves to a feeble imitation of the games of the\r\ncircus in such amusements as setting dogs to worry old horses or donkeys,\r\n&c. (Fig. 166). Bull-fights, nevertheless, continued in the southern\r\nprovinces of France, as also in Spain.\r\n\r\nAt village feasts not only did wrestling matches take place, but also\r\nqueer kinds of combats with sticks or birch boughs. Two men, blindfolded,\r\neach armed with a stick, and holding in his hand a rope fastened to a\r\nstake, entered the arena, and went round and round trying to strike at a\r\nfat goose or a pig which was also let loose with them. It can easily be\r\nimagined that the greater number of the blows fell like hail on one or\r\nother of the principal actors in this blind combat, amidst shouts of\r\nlaughter from the spectators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--Fight between a Horse and Dogs.--Fac-simile of a\r\nManuscript in the British Museum (Thirteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nNothing amused our ancestors more than these blind encounters; even kings\r\ntook part at these burlesque representations. At Mid-Lent annually they\r\nattended with their court at the Quinze-Vingts, in Paris, in order to see\r\nblindfold persons, armed from head to foot, fighting with a lance or\r\nstick. This amusement was quite sufficient to attract all Paris. In 1425,\r\non the last day of August, the inhabitants of the capital crowded their\r\nwindows to witness the procession of four blind men, clothed in full\r\narmour, like knights going to a tournament, and preceded by two men, one\r\nplaying the hautbois and the other bearing a banner on which a pig was\r\npainted. These four champions on the next day attacked a pig, which was to\r\nbecome the property of the one who killed it. The lists were situated in\r\nthe court of the Hôtel d'Armagnac, the present site of the Palais Royal. A\r\ngreat crowd attended the encounter. The blind men, armed with all sorts of\r\nweapons, belaboured each other so furiously that the game would have ended\r\nfatally to one or more of them had they not been separated and made to\r\ndivide the pig which they had all so well earned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--Merchants and Lion-keepers at Constantinople.--Fac-simile of\r\nan Engraving on Wood from the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Thevet: folio,\r\n1575.]\r\n\r\nThe people of the Middle Ages had an insatiable love of sight-seeing; they\r\ncame great distances, from all parts, to witness any amusing exhibition.\r\nThey would suffer any amount of privation or fatigue to indulge this\r\nfeeling, and they gave themselves up to it so heartily that it became a\r\nsolace to them in their greatest sorrows, and they laughed with that\r\nhearty laugh which may be said to be one of their natural characteristics.\r\nIn all public processions in the open air the crowd (or rather, as we\r\nmight say, the Cockneys of Paris), in their anxiety to see everything that\r\nwas to be seen, would frequently obstruct all the public avenues, and so\r\nprevent the procession from passing along. In consequence of this the\r\nProvosts of Paris on these occasions distributed hundreds of stout sticks\r\namongst the sergeants, who used them freely on the shoulders of the most\r\nobstinate sight-seers (see chapter on Ceremonials). There was no religious\r\nprocession, no parish fair, no municipal feast, and no parade or review of\r\ntroops, which did not bring together crowds of people, whose ears and eyes\r\nwere wide open, if only to hear the sound of the trumpet, or to see a \"dog\r\nrush past with a frying-pan tied to his tail.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--Free Distribution of Bread, Meat, and Wine to the\r\nPeople.--Reduced Copy of a Woodcut of the Solemn Entry of Charles V and\r\nPope Clement VII into Bologna, in 1530.]\r\n\r\nThis curiosity of the French was particularly exhibited when the kings of\r\nthe first royal dynasty held their _Champs de Mars_, the kings of the\r\nsecond dynasty their _Cours Plenières_, and the kings of the third dynasty\r\ntheir _Cours Couronnées._ In these assemblies, where the King gathered\r\ntogether all his principal vassals once or twice a year, to hold personal\r\ncommunication with them, and to strengthen his power by ensuring their\r\nfeudal services, large quantities of food and fermented liquors were\r\npublicly distributed among the people (Fig. 168). The populace were always\r\nmost enthusiastic spectators of military displays, of court ceremonies,\r\nand, above all, of the various amusements which royalty provided for them\r\nat great cost in those days: and it was on these state occasions that\r\njugglers, tumblers, and minstrels displayed their talents. The _Champ de\r\nMars_ was one of the principal fêtes of the year, and was held sometimes\r\nin the centre of some large town, sometimes in a royal domain, and\r\nsometimes in the open country. Bishop Gregory of Tours describes one which\r\nwas given in his diocese during the reign of Chilpéric, at the Easter\r\nfestivals, at which we may be sure that the games of the circus,\r\nre-established by Chilpéric, excited the greatest interest. Charlemagne\r\nalso held _Champs de Mars_, but called them _Cours Royales,_ at which he\r\nappeared dressed in cloth of gold studded all over with pearls and\r\nprecious stones. Under the third dynasty King Robert celebrated court days\r\nwith the same magnificence, and the people were admitted to the palace\r\nduring the royal banquet to witness the King sitting amongst his great\r\nofficers of state. The _Cours Plénières_, which were always held at\r\nChristmas, Twelfth-day, Easter, and on the day of Pentecost, were not less\r\nbrilliant during the reigns of Robert's successors. Louis IX. himself,\r\nnotwithstanding his natural shyness and his taste for simplicity, was\r\nnoted for the display he made on state occasions. In 1350, Philippe de\r\nValois wore his crown at the _Cours Plénières_, and from that time they\r\nwere called _Cours Couronnées_. The kings of jugglers were the privileged\r\nperformers, and their feats and the other amusements, which continued on\r\neach occasion for several days, were provided for at the sovereign's sole\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--Feats in Balancing.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript\r\nin the Bodleian Library at Oxford (Thirteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nThese kings of jugglers exercised a supreme authority over the art of\r\njugglery and over all the members of this jovial fraternity. It must not\r\nbe imagined that these jugglers merely recited snatches from tales and\r\nfables in rhyme; this was the least of their talents. The cleverest of\r\nthem played all sorts of musical instruments, sung songs, and repeated by\r\nheart a multitude of stories, after the example of their reputed\r\nforefather, King Borgabed, or Bédabie, who, according to these\r\ntroubadours, was King of Great Britain at the time that Alexander the\r\nGreat was King of Macedonia. The jugglers of a lower order especially\r\nexcelled in tumbling and in tricks of legerdemain (Figs. 169 and 170).\r\nThey threw wonderful somersaults, they leaped through hoops placed at\r\ncertain distances from one another, they played with knives, slings,\r\nbaskets, brass balls, and earthenware plates, and they walked on their\r\nhands with their feet in the air or with their heads turned downwards so\r\nas to look through their legs backwards. These acrobatic feats were even\r\npractised by women. According to a legend, the daughter of Herodias was a\r\nrenowned acrobat, and on a bas-relief in the Cathedral of Rouen we find\r\nthis Jewish dancer turning somersaults before Herod, so as to fascinate\r\nhim, and thus obtain the decapitation of John the Baptist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--Sword-dance to the sound of the Bagpipe.--Fac-simile of a\r\nManuscript in the British Museum (Fourteenth Century).]\r\n\r\n\"The jugglers,\" adds M. de Labédollière, in his clever work on \"The\r\nPrivate Life of the French,\" \"often led about bears, monkeys, and other\r\nanimals, which they taught to dance or to fight (Figs. 171 and 172). A\r\nmanuscript in the National Library represents a banquet, and around the\r\ntable, so as to amuse the guests, performances of animals are going on,\r\nsuch as monkeys riding on horseback, a bear feigning to be dead, a goat\r\nplaying the harp, and dogs walking on their hind legs.\" We find the same\r\ngrotesque figures on sculptures, on the capitals of churches, on the\r\nilluminated margins of manuscripts of theology, and on prayer-books, which\r\nseems to indicate that jugglers were the associates of painters and\r\nilluminators, even if they themselves were not the writers and\r\nilluminators of the manuscripts. \"Jugglery,\" M. de Labédollière goes on to\r\nsay, \"at that time embraced poetry, music, dancing, sleight of hand,\r\nconjuring, wrestling, boxing, and the training of animals. Its humblest\r\npractitioners were the mimics or grimacers, in many-coloured garments, and\r\nbrazen-faced mountebanks, who provoked laughter at the expense of\r\ndecency.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--Jugglers exhibiting Monkeys and\r\nBears.--Fac-simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum (Thirteenth\r\nCentury).]\r\n\r\nAt first, and down to the thirteenth century, the profession of a juggler\r\nwas a most lucrative one. There was no public or private feast of any\r\nimportance without the profession being represented. Their mimicry and\r\nacrobatic feats were less thought of than their long poems or lays of wars\r\nand adventures, which they recited in doggerel rhyme to the accompaniment\r\nof a stringed instrument. The doors of the châteaux were always open to\r\nthem, and they had a place assigned to them at all feasts. They were the\r\nprincipal attraction at the _Cours Plénières_, and, according to the\r\ntestimony of one of their poets, they frequently retired from business\r\nloaded with presents, such as riding-horses, carriage-horses, jewels,\r\ncloaks, fur robes, clothing of violet or scarlet cloth, and, above all,\r\nwith large sums of money. They loved to recall with pride the heroic\r\nmemory of one of their own calling, the brave Norman, Taillefer, who,\r\nbefore the battle of Hastings, advanced alone on horseback between the two\r\narmies about to commence the engagement, and drew off the attention of the\r\nEnglish by singing them the song of Roland. He then began juggling, and\r\ntaking his lance by the hilt, he threw it into the air and caught it by\r\nthe point as it fell; then, drawing his sword, he spun it several times\r\nover his head, and caught it in a similar way as it fell. After these\r\nskilful exercises, during which the enemy were gaping in mute\r\nastonishment, he forced his charger through the English ranks, and caused\r\ngreat havoc before he fell, positively riddled with wounds.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this noble instance, not to belie the old proverb,\r\njugglers were never received into the order of knighthood. They were,\r\nafter a time, as much abused as they had before been extolled. Their\r\nlicentious lives reflected itself in their obscene language. Their\r\npantomimes, like their songs, showed that they were the votaries of the\r\nlowest vices. The lower orders laughed at their coarseness, and were\r\namused at their juggleries; but the nobility were disgusted with them, and\r\nthey were absolutely excluded from the presence of ladies and girls in the\r\nchâteaux and houses of the bourgeoisie. We see in the tale of \"Le Jugleor\"\r\nthat they acquired ill fame everywhere, inasmuch as they were addicted to\r\nevery sort of vice. The clergy, and St. Bernard especially, denounced them\r\nand held them up to public contempt. St. Bernard spoke thus of them in one\r\nof his sermons written in the middle of the twelfth century: \"A man fond\r\nof jugglers will soon enough possess a wife whose name is Poverty. If it\r\nhappens that the tricks of jugglers are forced upon your notice, endeavour\r\nto avoid them, and think of other things. The tricks of jugglers never\r\nplease God.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.--Equestrian Performances.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in an\r\nEnglish Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nFrom this remark we may understand their fall as well as the disrepute in\r\nwhich they were held at that time, and we are not surprised to find in an\r\nold edition of the \"Mémoires du Sire de Joinville\" this passage, which is,\r\nperhaps, an interpolation from a contemporary document: \"St. Louis drove\r\nfrom his kingdom all tumblers and players of sleight of hand, through whom\r\nmany evil habits and tastes had become engendered in the people.\" A\r\ntroubadour's story of this period shows that the jugglers wandered about\r\nthe country with their trained animals nearly starved; they were half\r\nnaked, and were often without anything on their heads, without coats,\r\nwithout shoes, and always without money. The lower orders welcomed them,\r\nand continued to admire and idolize them for their clever tricks (Fig.\r\n173), but the bourgeois class, following the example of the nobility,\r\nturned their backs upon them. In 1345 Guillaume de Gourmont, Provost of\r\nParis, forbad their singing or relating obscene stories, under penalty of\r\nfine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--Jugglers performing in public.--From a Miniature\r\nof the Manuscript of \"Guarin de Loherane\" (Thirteenth Century).--Library\r\nof the Arsenal, Paris.]\r\n\r\nHaving been associated together as a confraternity since 1331, they lived\r\nhuddled together in one street of Paris, which took the name of _Rue des\r\nJougleurs_. It was at this period that the Church and Hospital of St.\r\nJulian were founded through the exertions of Jacques Goure, a native of\r\nPistoia, and of Huet le Lorrain, who were both jugglers. The newly formed\r\nbrotherhood at once undertook to subscribe to this good work, and each\r\nmember did so according to his means. Their aid to the cost of the two\r\nbuildings was sixty livres, and they were both erected in the Rue St.\r\nMartin, and placed under the protection of St. Julian the Martyr. The\r\nchapel was consecrated on the last Sunday in September, 1335, and on the\r\nfront of it there were three figures, one representing a troubadour, one a\r\nminstrel, and one a juggler, each with his various instruments.\r\n\r\nThe bad repute into which jugglers had fallen did not prevent the kings of\r\nFrance from attaching buffoons, or fools, as they were generally called,\r\nto their households, who were often more or less deformed dwarfs, and who,\r\nto all intents and purposes, were jugglers. They were allowed to indulge\r\nin every sort of impertinence and waggery in order to excite the\r\nrisibility of their masters (Figs. 174 and 175). These buffoons or fools\r\nwere an institution at court until the time of Louis XIV., and several,\r\nsuch as Caillette, Triboulet, and Brusquet, are better known in history\r\nthan many of the statesmen and soldiers who were their contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--Dance of Fools.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in\r\nManuscript of the Thirteenth Century in the Bodleian Library of Oxford.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourteenth century the brotherhood of jugglers divided\r\nitself into two distinct classes, the jugglers proper and the tumblers.\r\nThe former continued to recite serious or amusing poetry, to sing\r\nlove-songs, to play comic interludes, either singly or in concert, in the\r\nstreets or in the houses, accompanying themselves or being accompanied by\r\nall sorts of musical instruments. The tumblers, on the other hand, devoted\r\nthemselves exclusively to feats of agility or of skill, the exhibition of\r\ntrained animals, the making of comic grimaces, and tight-rope dancing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Court-Fool, of the 15th Century.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of a miniature from a ms. in the Bibl. de l'Arsenal, Th. lat.,\r\nno 125.]\r\n\r\nThe art of rope dancing is very ancient; it was patronised by the\r\nFranks, who looked upon it as a marvellous effort of human genius. The\r\nmost remarkable rope-dancers of that time were of Indian origin. All\r\nperformers in this art came originally from the East, although they\r\nafterwards trained pupils in the countries through which they passed,\r\nrecruiting themselves chiefly from the mixed tribe of jugglers. According\r\nto a document quoted by the learned Foncemagne, rope-dancers appeared as\r\nearly as 1327 at the entertainments given at state banquets by the kings\r\nof France. But long before that time they are mentioned in the poems of\r\ntroubadours as the necessary auxiliaries of any feast given by the\r\nnobility, or even by the monasteries. From the fourteenth to the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century they were never absent from any public ceremonial,\r\nand it was at the state entries of kings and queens, princes and\r\nprincesses, that they were especially called upon to display their\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.--Court Fool.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the\r\n\"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: folio (Basle, 1552).]\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary examples of the daring of these tumblers is\r\nto be found in the records of the entry of Queen Isabel of Bavaria into\r\nParis, in 1385 (see chapter on Ceremonials); and, indeed, all the\r\nchronicles of the fifteenth century are full of anecdotes of their doings.\r\nMathieu de Coucy, who wrote a history of the time of Charles VII., relates\r\nsome very curious details respecting a show which took place at Milan, and\r\nwhich astonished the whole of Europe:--\"The Duke of Milan ordered a rope\r\nto be stretched across his palace, about one hundred and fifty feet from\r\nthe ground, and of equal length. On to this a Portuguese mounted, walked\r\nstraight along, going backwards and forwards, and dancing to the sound of\r\nthe tambourine. He also hung from the rope with his head downwards, and\r\nwent through all sorts of tricks. The ladies who were looking on could not\r\nhelp hiding their eyes in their handkerchiefs, from fear lest they should\r\nsee him overbalance and fall and kill himself.\" The chronicler of Charles\r\nXII., Jean d'Arton, tells us of a not less remarkable feat, performed on\r\nthe occasion of the obsequies of Duke Pierre de Bourbon, which were\r\ncelebrated at Moulins, in the month of October, 1503, in the presence of\r\nthe king and the court. \"Amongst other performances was that of a German\r\ntight-rope dancer, named Georges Menustre, a very young man, who had a\r\nthick rope stretched across from the highest part of the tower of the\r\nCastle of Mâcon to the windows of the steeple of the Church of the\r\nJacobites. The height of this from the ground was twenty-five fathoms, and\r\nthe distance from the castle to the steeple some two hundred and fifty\r\npaces. On two evenings in succession he walked along this rope, and on the\r\nsecond occasion when he started from the tower of the castle his feat was\r\nwitnessed by the king and upwards of thirty thousand persons. He performed\r\nall sorts of graceful tricks, such as dancing grotesque dances to music\r\nand hanging to the rope by his feet and by his teeth. Although so strange\r\nand marvellous, these feats were nevertheless actually performed, unless\r\nhuman sight had been deceived by magic. A female dancer also performed in\r\na novel way, cutting capers, throwing somersaults, and performing graceful\r\nMoorish and other remarkable and peculiar dances.\" Such was their manner\r\nof celebrating a funeral.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century these dancers and tumblers became so numerous\r\nthat they were to be met with everywhere, in the provinces as well as in\r\nthe towns. Many of them were Bohemians or Zingari. They travelled in\r\ncompanies, sometimes on foot, sometimes on horseback, and sometimes with\r\nsome sort of a conveyance containing the accessories of their craft and a\r\ntravelling theatre. But people began to tire of these sorts of\r\nentertainments, the more so as they were required to pay for them, and\r\nthey naturally preferred the public rejoicings, which cost them nothing.\r\nThey were particularly fond of illuminations and fireworks, which are of\r\nmuch later origin than the invention of gunpowder; although the Saracens,\r\nat the time of the Crusades, used a Greek fire for illuminations, which\r\nconsiderably alarmed the Crusaders when they first witnessed its effects.\r\nRegular fireworks appear to have been invented in Italy, where the\r\npyrotechnic art has retained its superiority to this day, and where the\r\ninhabitants are as enthusiastic as ever for this sort of amusement, and\r\nconsider it, in fact, inseparable from every religious, private, or public\r\nfestival. This Italian invention was first introduced into the Low\r\nCountries by the Spaniards, where it found many admirers, and it made its\r\nappearance in France with the Italian artists who established themselves\r\nin that country in the reigns of Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I.\r\nFireworks could not fail to be attractive at the Court of the Valois, to\r\nwhich Catherine de Médicis had introduced the manners and customs of\r\nItaly. The French, who up to that time had only been accustomed to the\r\nilluminations of St. John's Day and of the first Sunday in Lent, received\r\nthose fireworks with great enthusiasm, and they soon became a regular part\r\nof the programme for public festivals (Fig. 176).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--Fireworks on the Water, with an Imitation of a\r\nNaval Combat.--Fac-simile of an Engraving on Copper of the \"Pyrotechnie\"\r\nof Hanzelet le Lorrain: 4to (Pont-à-Mousson, 1630).]\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto only described the sports engaged in for the amusement of\r\nthe spectators; we have still to describe those in which the actors took\r\ngreater pleasure than even the spectators themselves. These were specially\r\nthe games of strength and skill as well as dancing, with a notice of which\r\nwe shall conclude this chapter. There were, besides, the various games of\r\nchance and the games of fun and humour. Most of the bourgeois and the\r\nvillagers played a variety of games of agility, many of which have\r\ndescended to our times, and are still to be found at our schools and\r\ncolleges. Wrestling, running races, the game of bars, high and wide\r\njumping, leap-frog, blind-man's buff, games of ball of all sorts,\r\ngymnastics, and all exercises which strengthened the body or added to the\r\nsuppleness of the limbs, were long in use among the youth of the nobility\r\n(Figs. 177 and 178). The Lord of Fleuranges, in his memoirs written at the\r\ncourt of Francis I., recounts numerous exercises to which he devoted\r\nhimself during his childhood and youth, and which were then looked upon as\r\na necessary part of the education of chivalry. The nobles in this way\r\nacquired a taste for physical exercises, and took naturally to combats,\r\ntournaments, and hunting, and subsequently their services in the\r\nbattle-field gave them plenty of opportunities to gratify the taste thus\r\ndeveloped in them. These were not, however, sufficient for their\r\ninsatiable activity; when they could not do anything else, they played at\r\ntennis and such games at all hours of the day; and these pastimes had so\r\nmuch attraction for nobles of all ages that they not unfrequently\r\nsacrificed their health in consequence of overtaxing their strength. In\r\n1506 the King of Castile, Philippe le Beau, died of pleurisy, from a\r\nsevere cold which he caught while playing tennis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.--Somersaults.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\n\"Exercises in Leaping and Vaulting,\" by A. Tuccaro: 4to (Paris, 1599).]\r\n\r\nTennis also became the favourite game amongst the bourgeois in the towns,\r\nand tennis-courts were built in all parts, of such spacious proportions\r\nand so well adapted for spectators, that they were often converted into\r\ntheatres. Their game of billiards resembled the modern one only in name,\r\nfor it was played on a level piece of ground with wooden balls which were\r\nstruck with hooked sticks and mallets. It was in great repute in the\r\nfourteenth century, for in 1396 Marshal de Boucicault, who was considered\r\none of the best players of his time, won at it six hundred francs (or more\r\nthan twenty-eight thousand francs of present currency). At the beginning\r\nof the following century the Duke Louis d'Orleans ordered _billes et\r\nbillars_ to be bought for the sum of eleven sols six deniers tournois\r\n(about fifteen francs of our money), that he might amuse himself with\r\nthem. There were several games of the same sort, which were not less\r\npopular. Skittles; _la Soule_ or _Soulette_, which consisted of a large\r\nball of hay covered over with leather, the possession of which was\r\ncontested for by two opposing sides of players; Football; open Tennis;\r\nShuttlecock, &c. It was Charles V. who first thought of giving a more\r\nserious and useful character to the games of the people, and who, in a\r\ncelebrated edict forbidding games of chance, encouraged the establishment\r\nof companies of archers and bowmen. These companies, to which was\r\nsubsequently added that of the arquebusiers, outlived political\r\nrevolutions, and are still extant, especially in the northern provinces of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.--The Spring-board.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\n\"Exercises in Leaping and Vaulting,\" by A. Tuccaro: 4to (Paris, 1599).]\r\n\r\nAt all times and in all countries the games of chance were the most\r\npopular, although they were forbidden both by ecclesiastical and royal\r\nauthority. New laws were continually being enacted against them, and\r\nespecially against those in which dice were used, though with little\r\navail. \"Dice shall not be made in the kingdom,\" says the law of 1256; and\r\n\"those who are discovered using them, and frequenting taverns and bad\r\nplaces, will be looked upon as suspicions characters.\" A law of 1291\r\nrepeats, \"That games with dice be forbidden.\" Nevertheless, though these\r\nprohibitions were frequently renewed, people continued to disregard them\r\nand to lose much money at such games. The law of 1396 is aimed\r\nparticularly against loaded dice, which must have been contemporary with\r\nthe origin of dice themselves, for no games ever gave rise to a greater\r\namount of roguery than those of this description. They were, however,\r\npublicly sold in spite of all the laws to the contrary; for, in the \"Dit\r\ndu Mercier,\" the dealer offers his merchandise thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"J'ay dez de plus, j'ay dez de moins,\r\n  De Paris, de Chartres, de Rains.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"I have heavy dice, I have light dice,\r\n  From Paris, from Chartres, and from Rains.\")\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the game of dice was at first called the _game of\r\nGod_, because the regulation of lottery was one of God's prerogatives; but\r\nthis derivation is purely imaginary. What appears more likely is, that\r\ndice were first forbidden by the Church, and then by the civil\r\nauthorities, on account of the fearful oaths which were so apt to be\r\nuttered by those players who had a run of ill luck. Nothing was commoner\r\nthan for people to ruin themselves at this game. The poems of troubadours\r\nare full of imprecations against the fatal chance of dice; many\r\ntroubadours, such as Guillaume Magret and Gaucelm Faydit, lost their\r\nfortunes at it, and their lives in consequence. Rutebeuf exclaims, in one\r\nof his satires, \"Dice rob me of all my clothes, dice kill me, dice watch\r\nme, dice track me, dice attack me, and dice defy me.\" The blasphemies of\r\nthe gamblers did not always remain unpunished. \"Philip Augustus,\" says\r\nBigord, in his Latin history of this king, \"carried his aversion for oaths\r\nto such an extent, that if any one, whether knight or of any other rank,\r\nlet one slip from his lips in the presence of the sovereign, even by\r\nmistake, he was ordered to be immediately thrown into the river.\" Louis\r\nXII., who was somewhat less severe, contented himself with having a hole\r\nbored with a hot iron through the blasphemer's tongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 179 and 180.--French Cards for a Game of Piquet,\r\nearly Sixteenth Century.--Collection of the National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe work \"On the Manner of playing with Dice,\" has handed down to us the\r\ntechnical terms used in these games, which varied as much in practice as\r\nin name. They sometimes played with three dice, sometimes with six;\r\ndifferent games were also in fashion, and in some the cast of the dice\r\nalone decided. The games of cards were also most numerous, but it is not\r\nour intention to give the origin of them here. It is sufficient to name a\r\nfew of the most popular ones in France, which were, Flux, Prime, Sequence,\r\nTriomphe, Piquet, Trente-et-un, Passe-dix, Condemnade, Lansquenet,\r\nMarriage, Gay, or J'ai, Malcontent, Hère, &c. (Figs. 179 and 180). All\r\nthese games, which were as much forbidden as dice, were played in taverns\r\nas well as at court; and, just as there were loaded dice, so were there\r\nalso false cards, prepared by rogues for cheating. The greater number of\r\nthe games of cards formerly did not require the least skill on the part of\r\nthe players, chance alone deciding. The game of _Tables_, however,\r\nrequired skill and calculation, for under this head were comprised all the\r\ngames which were played on a board, and particularly chess, draughts, and\r\nbackgammon. The invention of the game of chess has been attributed to the\r\nAssyrians, and there can be no doubt but that it came from the East, and\r\nreached Gaul about the beginning of the ninth century, although it was not\r\nextensively known till about the twelfth. The annals of chivalry\r\ncontinually speak of the barons playing at these games, and especially at\r\nchess. Historians also mention chess, and show that it was played with\r\nthe same zest in the camp of the Saracens as in that of the Crusaders. We\r\nmust not be surprised if chess shared the prohibition laid upon dice, for\r\nthose who were ignorant of its ingenious combinations ranked it amongst\r\ngames of chance. The Council of Paris, in 1212, therefore condemned chess\r\nfor the same reasons as dice, and it was specially forbidden to church\r\npeople, who had begun to make it their habitual pastime. The royal edict\r\nof 1254 was equally unjust with regard to this game. \"We strictly forbid,\"\r\nsays Louis IX., \"any person to play at dice, tables, or chess.\" This pious\r\nking set himself against these games, which he looked upon as inventions\r\nof the devil. After the fatal day of Mansorah, in 1249, the King, who was\r\nstill in Egypt with the remnants of his army, asked what his brother, the\r\nComte d'Anjou, was doing. \"He was told,\" says Joinville, \"that he was\r\nplaying at tables with his Royal Highness Gaultier de Nemours. The King\r\nwas highly incensed against his brother, and, though most feeble from the\r\neffects of his illness, went to him, and taking the dice and the tables,\r\nhad them thrown into the sea.\" Nevertheless Louis IX. received as a\r\npresent from the _Vieux de la Montagne_, chief of the Ismalians, a\r\nchessboard made of gold and rock crystal, the pieces being of precious\r\nmetals beautifully worked. It has been asserted, but incorrectly, that\r\nthis chessboard was the one preserved in the Musée de Cluny, after having\r\nlong formed part of the treasures of the Kings of France.\r\n\r\nAmongst the games comprised under the name of _tables_, it is sufficient\r\nto mention that of draughts, which was formerly played with dice and with\r\nthe same men as were used for chess; also the game of _honchet_, or\r\n_jonchées_, that is, bones or spillikins, games which required pieces or\r\nmen in the same way as chess, but which required more quickness of hand\r\nthan of intelligence; and _épingles_, or push-pin, which was played in a\r\nsimilar manner to the _honchets_, and was the great amusement of the small\r\npages in the houses of the nobility. When they had not épingles, honchets,\r\nor draughtsmen to play with, they used their fingers instead, and played a\r\ngame which is still most popular amongst the Italian people, called the\r\n_morra_, and which was as much in vogue with the ancient Romans as it is\r\namong the modern Italians. It consisted of suddenly raising as many\r\nfingers as had been shown by one's adversary, and gave rise to a great\r\namount of amusement among the players and lookers-on. The games played by\r\ngirls were, of course, different from those in use among boys. The latter\r\nplayed at marbles, _luettes_, peg or humming tops, quoits, _fouquet,\r\nmerelles_, and a number of other games, many of which are now unknown. The\r\ngirls, it is almost needless to say, from the earliest times played with\r\ndolls. _Briche_, a game in which a brick and a small stick was used, were\r\nalso a favourite. _Martiaus_, or small quoits, wolf or fox, blind man's\r\nbuff, hide and seek, quoits, &c., were all girls' games. The greater part\r\nof these amusements were enlivened by a chorus, which all the girls sang\r\ntogether, or by dialogues sung or chanted in unison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.--Allegorical Scene of one of the Courts of Love\r\nin Provence--In the First Compartment, the God of Love, Cupid, is sitting\r\non the Stump of a Laurel-tree, wounding with his Darts those who do him\r\nhomage, the Second Compartment represents the Love Vows of Men and\r\nWomen.--From the Cover of a Looking-glass, carved in Ivory, of the end of\r\nthe Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chess-Players.\r\n\r\nAfter a miniature of \"_The Three Ages of Man_\", a ms. of the fifteenth\r\ncentury attributed to Estienne Porchier.

It would require long antiquarian\r\nresearches to discover the origin and mode of playing many of these\r\npastimes, such as _des oes, des trois ânes, des accords bigarrés, du\r\njardin madame, de la fricade, du feiseau, de la mick_, and a number of\r\nothers which are named but not described in the records of the times. The\r\ngame _à l'oreille,_ the invention of which is attributed to the troubadour\r\nGuillaume Adhémar, the _jeu des Valentines,_ or the game of lovers, and\r\nthe numerous games of forfeits, which have come down to us from the Courts\r\nof Love of the Middle Ages, we find to be somewhat deprived of their\r\noriginal simplicity in the way they are now played in country-houses in\r\nthe winter and at village festivals in the summer. But the Courts of Love\r\nare no longer in existence gravely to superintend all these diversions\r\n(Fig. 181).\r\n\r\nAmongst the amusements which time has not obliterated, but which, on the\r\ncontrary, seem destined to be of longer duration than monuments of stone\r\nand brass, we must name dancing, which was certainly one of the principal\r\namusements of society, and which has come down to us through all\r\nreligions, all customs, all people, and all ages, preserving at the same\r\ntime much of its original character. Dancing appears, at each period of\r\nthe world's history, to have been alternately religions and profane,\r\nlively and solemn, frivolous and severe. Though dancing was as common an\r\namusement formerly as it is now, there was this essential difference\r\nbetween the two periods, namely, that certain people, such as the Romans,\r\nwere very fond of seeing dancing, but did not join in it themselves.\r\nTiberius drove the dancers out of Rome, and Domitian dismissed certain\r\nsenators from their seats in the senate who had degraded themselves by\r\ndancing; and there seems to be no doubt that the Romans, from the conquest\r\nof Julius Caesar, did not themselves patronise the art. There were a\r\nnumber of professional dancers in Gaul, as well as in the other provinces\r\nof the Roman Empire, who were hired to dance at feasts, and who\r\nendeavoured to do their best to make their art as popular as possible. The\r\nlightheartedness of the Gauls, their natural gaiety, their love for\r\nviolent exercise and for pleasures of all sorts, made them delight in\r\ndancing, and indulge in it with great energy; and thus, notwithstanding\r\nthe repugnance of the Roman aristocracy and the prohibitions and anathemas\r\nof councils and synods, dancing has always been one of the favourite\r\npastimes of the Gauls and the French.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--Dancers on Christmas Night punished for their\r\nImpiety, and condemned to dance for a whole Year (Legend of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury).--Fac-simile of a Woodcut by P. Wohlgemuth, in the \"Liber\r\nChronicorum Mundi:\" folio (Nuremberg, 1493).]\r\n\r\nLeuce Carin, a writer of doubtful authority, states that in the early\r\nhistory of Christianity the faithful danced, or rather stamped, in\r\nmeasured time during religions ceremonials, gesticulating and distorting\r\nthemselves. This is, however, a mistake. The only thing approaching to it\r\nwas the slight trace of the ancient Pagan dances which remained in the\r\nfeast of the first Sunday in Lent, and which probably belonged to the\r\nreligious ceremonies of the Druids. At nightfall fires were lighted in\r\npublic places, and numbers of people danced madly round them. Rioting and\r\ndisorderly conduct often resulted from this popular feast, and the\r\nmagistrates were obliged to interfere in order to suppress it. The church,\r\ntoo, did not close her eyes to the abuses which this feast engendered,\r\nalthough episcopal admonitions were not always listened to (Fig. 182). We\r\nsee, in the records of one of the most recent Councils of Narbonne, that\r\nthe custom of dancing in the churches and in the cemeteries on certain\r\nfeasts had not been abolished in some parts of the Languedoc at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nDancing was at all times forbidden by the Catholic Church on account of\r\nits tendency to corrupt the morals, and for centuries ecclesiastical\r\nauthority was strenuously opposed to it; but, on the other hand, it could\r\nnot complain of want of encouragement from the civil power. When King\r\nChildebert, in 554, forbade all dances in his domains, he was only induced\r\nto do so by the influence of the bishops. We have but little information\r\nrespecting the dances of this period, and it would be impossible\r\naccurately to determine as to the justice of their being forbidden. They\r\nwere certainly no longer those war-dances which the Franks had brought\r\nwith them, and which antiquarians have mentioned under the name of\r\n_Pyrrhichienne_ dances. In any case, war-dances reappeared at the\r\ncommencement of chivalry; for, when a new knight was elected, all the\r\nknights in full armour performed evolutions, either on foot or on\r\nhorseback, to the sound of military music, and the populace danced round\r\nthem. It has been said that this was the origin of court ballets, and La\r\nColombière, in his \"Théâtre d'Honneur et de Chevalerie,\" relates that this\r\nancient dance of the knights was kept up by the Spaniards, who called it\r\nthe _Moresque_.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages was the great epoch for dancing, especially in France.\r\nThere were an endless number of dancing festivals, and, from reading the\r\nold poets and romancers, one might imagine that the French had never\r\nanything better to do than to dance, and that at all hours of the day and\r\nnight. A curious argument in favour of the practical utility of dancing is\r\nsuggested by Jean Tabourot in his \"Orchésographie,\" published at Langres\r\nin 1588, under the name of Thoinot Arbeau. He says, \"Dancing is practised\r\nin order to see whether lovers are healthy and suitable for one another:\r\nat the end of a dance the gentlemen are permitted to kiss their\r\nmistresses, in order that they may ascertain if they have an agreeable\r\nbreath. In this matter, besides many other good results which follow from\r\ndancing, it becomes necessary for the good governing of society.\" Such was\r\nthe doctrine of the Courts of Love, which stoutly took up the defence of\r\ndancing against the clergy. In those days, as soon as the two sexes were\r\nassembled in sufficient numbers, before or after the feasts, the balls\r\nbegan, and men and women took each other by the hand and commenced the\r\nperformance in regular steps (Fig. 183). The author of the poem of\r\nProvence, called \"Flamença,\" thus allegorically describes these\r\namusements: \"Youth and Gaiety opened the ball, accompanied by their sister\r\nBravery; Cowardice, confused, went of her own accord and hid herself.\" The\r\ntroubadours mention a great number of dances, without describing them; no\r\ndoubt they were so familiar that they thought a description of them\r\nneedless. They often speak of the _danse au virlet_, a kind of round\r\ndance, during the performance of which each person in turn sang a verse,\r\nthe chorus being repeated by all. In the code of the Courts of Love,\r\nentitled \"Arresta Amorum,\" that is, the decrees of love, the _pas de\r\nBrabant_ is mentioned, in which each gentleman bent his knee before his\r\nlady; and also the _danse au chapelet_, at the end of which each dancer\r\nkissed his lady. Romances of chivalry frequently mention that knights used\r\nto dance with the dames and young ladies without taking off their helmets\r\nand coats of mail. Although this costume was hardly fitted for the\r\npurpose, we find, in the romance of \"Perceforet,\" that, after a repast,\r\nwhilst the tables were being removed, everything was prepared for a ball,\r\nand that although the knights made no change in their accoutrements, yet\r\nthe ladies went and made fresh toilettes. \"Then,\" says the old novelist,\r\n\"the young knights and the young ladies began to play their instruments\r\nand to have the dance.\" From this custom may be traced the origin of the\r\nancient Gallic proverb, \"_Après la panse vient la danse_\" (\"After the\r\nfeast comes the dance\"). Sometimes a minstrel sang songs to the\r\naccompaniment of the harp, and the young ladies danced in couples and\r\nrepeated at intervals the minstrel's songs. Sometimes the torch-dance was\r\nperformed; in this each performer bore in his hand a long lighted taper,\r\nand endeavoured to prevent his neighbours from blowing it out, which each\r\none tried to do if possible (Fig. 184). This dance, which was in use up to\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century at court, was generally reserved for\r\nweddings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.--Peasant Dances at the May Feasts.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Miniature in a Prayer-book of the Fifteenth Century, in the National\r\nLibrary of Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.--Dance by Torchlight, a Scene at the Court of\r\nBurgundy.--From a Painting on Wood of 1463, belonging to M. H. Casterman,\r\nof Tournai (Belgium).]\r\n\r\nDancing lost much of its simplicity and harmlessness when masquerades were\r\nintroduced, these being the first examples of the ballet. These\r\nmasquerades, which soon after their introduction became passionately\r\nindulged in at court under Charles VI., were, at first, only allowed\r\nduring Carnival, and on particular occasions called _Charivaris_, and they\r\nwere usually made the pretext for the practice of the most licentious\r\nfollies. These masquerades had a most unfortunate inauguration by the\r\ncatastrophe which rendered the madness of Charles VI. incurable, and which\r\nis described in history under the name of the _Burning Ballet_. It was on\r\nthe 29th of January, 1393, that this ballet made famous the festival held\r\nin the Royal Palace of St. Paul in Paris, on the occasion of the marriage\r\nof one of the maids of honour of Queen Isabel of Bavaria with a gentleman\r\nof Vermandois. The bride was a widow, and the second nuptials were deemed\r\na fitting occasion for the Charivaris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.--The Burning Ballet.--Fac-simile of a Miniature\r\nin the Manuscript of the \"Chroniques\" of Froissart (Fifteenth Century), in\r\nthe National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Normandy, named Hugonin de Grensay, thought he could\r\ncreate a sensation by having a dance of wild men to please the ladies. \"He\r\nadmitted to his plot,\" says Froissart, \"the king and four of the principal\r\nnobles of the court. These all had themselves sewn up in close-fitting\r\nlinen garments covered with resin on which a quantity of tow was glued,\r\nand in this guise they appeared in the middle of the ball. The king was\r\nalone, but the other four were chained together. They jumped about like\r\nmadmen, uttered wild cries, and made all sorts of eccentric gestures. No\r\none knew who these hideous objects were, but the Duke of Orleans\r\ndetermined to find out, so he took a candle and imprudently approached too\r\nnear one of the men. The tow caught fire, and the flames enveloped him\r\nand the other three who were chained to him in a moment.\" \"They were\r\nburning for nearly an hour like torches,\" says a chronicler. \"The king had\r\nthe good fortune to escape the peril, because the Duchesse de Berry, his\r\naunt, recognised him, and had the presence of mind to envelop him in her\r\ntrain\" (Fig. 185). Such a calamity, one would have thought, might have\r\nbeen sufficient to disgust people with masquerades, but they were none the\r\nless in favour at court for many years afterwards; and, two centuries\r\nlater, the author of the \"Orchésographie\" thus writes on the subject:\r\n\"Kings and princes give dances and masquerades for amusement and in order\r\nto afford a joyful welcome to foreign nobles; we also practise the same\r\namusements on the celebration of marriages.\" In no country in the world\r\nwas dancing practised with more grace and elegance than in France. Foreign\r\ndances of every kind were introduced, and, after being remodelled and\r\nbrought to as great perfection as possible, they were often returned to\r\nthe countries from which they had been imported under almost a new\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.--Musicians accompanying the Dancing.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Wood Engraving in the \"Orchésographie\" of Thoinot Arbeau (Jehan\r\nTabourot): 4to (Langres, 1588).]\r\n\r\nIn 1548, the dances of the Béarnais, which were much admired at the court\r\nof the Comtes de Foix, especially those called the _danse mauresque_ and\r\nthe _danse des sauvages_, were introduced at the court of France, and\r\nexcited great merriment. So popular did they become, that with a little\r\nmodification they soon were considered essentially French. The German\r\ndances, which were distinguished by the rapidity of their movements, were\r\nalso thoroughly established at the court of France. Italian, Milanese,\r\nSpanish, and Piedmontese dances were in fashion in France before the\r\nexpedition of Charles VIII. into Italy: and when this king, followed by\r\nhis youthful nobility, passed over the mountains to march to the conquest\r\nof Naples, he found everywhere in the towns that welcomed him, and in\r\nwhich balls and masquerades were given in honour of his visit, the dance\r\n_à la mode de France_, which consisted of a sort of medley of the dances\r\nof all countries. Some hundreds of these dances have been enumerated in\r\nthe fifth book of the \"Pantagruel\" of Rabelais, and in various humorous\r\nworks of those who succeeded him. They owed their success to the singing\r\nwith which they were generally accompanied, or to the postures,\r\npantomimes, or drolleries with which they were supplemented for the\r\namusement of the spectators. A few, and amongst others that of the _five\r\nsteps_ and that of the _three faces_, are mentioned in the \"History of the\r\nQueen of Navarre.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.--The Dance called \"La Gaillarde.\"--Fac-simile of\r\nWood Engravings from the \"Orchésographie\" of Thoinot Arbeau (Jehan\r\nTabourot): 4to (Langres, 1588).]\r\n\r\nDances were divided into two distinct classes--_danses basses_, or common\r\nand regular dances, which did not admit of jumping, violent movements, or\r\nextraordinary contortions--and the _danses par haut_, which were\r\nirregular, and comprised all sorts of antics and buffoonery. The regular\r\nFrench dance was a _basse_ dance, called the _gaillarde_; it was\r\naccompanied by the sound of the hautbois and tambourine, and originally it\r\nwas danced with great form and state. This is the dance which Jean\r\nTabouret has described; it began with the two performers standing opposite\r\nto each other, advancing, bowing, and retiring. \"These advancings and\r\nretirings were done in steps to the time of the music, and continued until\r\nthe instrumental accompaniment stopped; then the gentleman made his bow\r\nto the lady, took her by the hand, thanked her, and led her to her seat.\"\r\nThe _tourdion_ was similar to the _gaillarde_, only faster, and was\r\naccompanied with more action. Each province of France had its national\r\ndance, such as the _bourrée_ of Auvergne, the _trioris_ of Brittany, the\r\n_branles_ of Poitou, and the _valses_ of Lorraine, which constituted a\r\nvery agreeable pastime, and one in which the French excelled all other\r\nnations. This art, \"so ancient, so honourable, and so profitable,\" to use\r\nthe words of Jean Tabourot, was long in esteem in the highest social\r\ncircles, and the old men liked to display their agility, and the dames and\r\nyoung ladies to find a temperate exercise calculated to contribute to\r\ntheir health as well as to their amusement.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century was the great era of dancing in all the courts of\r\nEurope; but under the Valois, the art had more charm and prestige at the\r\ncourt of France than anywhere else. The Queen-mother, Catherine,\r\nsurrounded by a crowd of pretty young ladies, who composed what she called\r\nher _flying squadron_, presided at these exciting dances. A certain\r\nBalthazar de Beaujoyeux was master of her ballets, and they danced at the\r\nCastle of Blois the night before the Duc de Guise was assassinated under\r\nthe eyes of Henry III., just as they had danced at the Château of the\r\nTuileries the day after St. Bartholomew's Day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--The Game of Bob Apple, or Swinging\r\nApple.--Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century, in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  State of Commerce after the Fall of the Roman.

Settlements on the Coast of Africa.--Consequences of\r\n  the Discovery of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Commerce in the Middle Ages,\" says M. Charles Grandmaison, \"differed but\r\nlittle from that of a more remote period. It was essentially a local and\r\nlimited traffic, rather inland than maritime, for long and perilous sea\r\nvoyages only commenced towards the end of the fifteenth century, or about\r\nthe time when Columbus discovered America.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fall of the Roman Empire, commerce was rendered insecure, and,\r\nindeed, it was almost completely put a stop to by the barbarian invasions,\r\nand all facility of communication between different nations, and even\r\nbetween towns of the same country, was interrupted. In those times of\r\nsocial confusion, there were periods of such poverty and distress, that\r\nfor want of money commerce was reduced to the simple exchange of the\r\npositive necessaries of life. When order was a little restored, and\r\nsociety and the minds of people became more composed, we see commerce\r\nrecovering its position; and France was, perhaps, the first country in\r\nEurope in which this happy change took place. Those famous cities of Gaul,\r\nwhich ancient authors describe to us as so rich and so industrious,\r\nquickly recovered their former prosperity, and the friendly relations\r\nwhich were established between the kings of the Franks and the Eastern\r\nEmpire encouraged the Gallic cities in cultivating a commerce, which was\r\nat that time the most important and most extensive in the world.\r\n\r\nMarseilles, the ancient Phoenician colony, once the rival and then the\r\nsuccessor to Carthage, was undoubtedly at the head of the commercial\r\ncities of France. Next to her came Arles, which supplied ship-builders and\r\nseamen to the fleet of Provence; and Narbonne, which admitted into its\r\nharbour ships from Spain, Sicily, and Africa, until, in consequence of the\r\nAude having changed its course, it was obliged to relinquish the greater\r\npart of its maritime commerce in favour of Montpellier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--View of Alexandria in Egypt, in the Sixteenth\r\nCentury.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the Travels of P. Belon,\r\n\"Observations de Plusieurs Singularitez,\" &c.: 4to (Paris, 1588).]\r\n\r\nCommerce maintained frequent communications with the East; it sought its\r\nsupplies on the coast of Syria, and especially at Alexandria, in Egypt,\r\nwhich was a kind of depôt for goods obtained from the rich countries lying\r\nbeyond the Red Sea (Figs. 189 and 190). The Frank navigators imported from\r\nthese countries, groceries, linen, Egyptian paper, pearls, perfumes, and a\r\nthousand other rare and choice articles. In exchange they offered chiefly\r\nthe precious metals in bars rather than coined, and it is probable that at\r\nthis period they also exported iron, wines, oil, and wax. The agricultural\r\nproduce and manufactures of Gaul had not sufficiently developed to\r\nprovide anything more than what was required for the producers themselves.\r\nIndustry was as yet, if not purely domestic, confined to monasteries and\r\nto the houses of the nobility; and even the kings employed women or serf\r\nworkmen to manufacture the coarse stuffs with which they clothed\r\nthemselves and their households. We may add, that the bad state of the\r\nroads, the little security they offered to travellers, the extortions of\r\nall kinds to which foreign merchants were subjected, and above all the\r\niniquitous System of fines and tolls which each landowner thought right to\r\nexact, before letting merchandise pass through his domains, all created\r\ninsuperable obstacles to the development of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.--Transport of Merchandise on the Backs of\r\nCamels.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the \"Cosmographie Universelle,\" of\r\nThevet: folio, 1575.]\r\n\r\nThe Frank kings on several occasions evinced a desire that communications\r\nfavourable to trade should be re-established in their dominions. We find,\r\nfor instance, Chilpéric making treaties with Eastern emperors in favour\r\nof the merchants of Agde and Marseilles, Queen Brunehaut making viaducts\r\nworthy of the Romans, and which still bear her name, and Dagobert opening\r\nat St. Denis free fairs--that is to say, free, or nearly so, from all\r\ntolls and taxes--to which goods, both agricultural and manufactured, were\r\nsent from every corner of Europe and the known world, to be afterwards\r\ndistributed through the towns and provinces by the enterprise of internal\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nAfter the reign of Dagobert, commerce again declined without positively\r\nceasing, for the revolution, which transferred the power of the kings to\r\nthe mayors of the palace was not of a nature to exhaust the resources of\r\npublic prosperity; and a charter of 710 proves that the merchants of\r\nSaxony, England, Normandy, and even Hungary, still flocked to the fairs of\r\nSt. Denis.\r\n\r\nUnder the powerful and administrative hand of Charlemagne, the roads being\r\nbetter kept up, and the rivers being made more navigable, commerce became\r\nsafe and more general; the coasts were protected from piratical\r\nincursions; lighthouses were erected at dangerous points, to prevent\r\nshipwrecks; and treaties of commerce with foreign nations, including even\r\nthe most distant, guaranteed the liberty and security of French traders\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nUnder the weak successors of this monarch, notwithstanding their many\r\nefforts, commerce was again subjected to all sorts of injustice and\r\nextortions, and all its safeguards were rapidly destroyed. The Moors in\r\nthe south, and the Normans in the north, appeared to desire to destroy\r\neverything which came in their way, and already Marseilles, in 838, was\r\ntaken and pillaged by the Greeks. The constant altercations between the\r\nsons of Louis le Débonnaire and their unfortunate father, their jealousies\r\namongst themselves, and their fratricidal wars, increased the measure of\r\npublic calamity, so that soon, overrun by foreign enemies and destroyed by\r\nher own sons, France became a vast field of disorder and desolation.\r\n\r\nThe Church, which alone possessed some social influence, never ceased to\r\nuse its authority in endeavouring to remedy this miserable state of\r\nthings; but episcopal edicts, papal anathemas, and decrees of councils,\r\nhad only a partial effect at this unhappy period. At any moment\r\nagricultural and commercial operations were liable to be interrupted, if\r\nnot completely ruined, by the violence of a wild and rapacious soldiery;\r\nat every step the roads, often impassable, were intercepted by toll-bars\r\nfor some due of a vexatious nature, besides being continually infested by\r\nbands of brigands, who carried off the merchandise and murdered those few\r\nmerchants who were so bold as to attempt to continue their business. It\r\nwas the Church, occupied as she was with the interests of civilisation,\r\nwho again assisted commerce to emerge from the state of annihilation into\r\nwhich it had fallen; and the \"Peace or Truce of God,\" established in 1041,\r\nendeavoured to stop at least the internal wars of feudalism, and it\r\nsucceeded, at any rate for a time, in arresting these disorders. This was\r\nall that could be done at that period, and the Church accomplished it, by\r\ntaking the high hand; and with as much unselfishness as energy and\r\ncourage, she regulated society, which had been abandoned by the civil\r\npower from sheer impotence and want of administrative capability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--Trade on the Seaports of the Levant.--After a\r\nMiniature in a Manuscript of the Travels of Marco Polo (Fifteenth\r\nCentury), Library of the Arsenal of Paris.]\r\n\r\nAt all events, thanks to ecclesiastical foresight, which increased the\r\nnumber of fairs and markets at the gates of abbeys and convents, the first\r\nstep was made towards the general resuscitation of commerce. Indeed, the\r\nChurch may be said to have largely contributed to develop the spirit of\r\nprogress and liberty, whence were to spring societies and nationalities,\r\nand, in a word, modern organization.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern commerce furnished the first elements of that trading activity\r\nwhich showed itself on the borders of the Mediterranean, and we find the\r\nancient towns of Provence and Languedoc springing up again by the aide of\r\nthe republics of Amalfi, Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, which had become the\r\nrich depôts of all maritime trade.\r\n\r\nAt first, as we have already stated, the wares of India came to Europe\r\nthrough the Greek port of Alexandria, or through Constantinople. The\r\nCrusades, which had facilitated the relations with Eastern countries,\r\ndeveloped a taste in the West for their indigenous productions, gave a\r\nfresh vigour to this foreign commerce, and rendered it more productive by\r\nremoving the stumbling blocks which had arrested its progress (Fig. 191).\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Palestine by the Crusaders had first opened all the towns\r\nand harbours of this wealthy region to Western traders, and many of them\r\nwere able permanently to establish themselves there, with all sorts of\r\nprivileges and exemptions from taxes, which were gladly offered to them by\r\nthe nobles who had transferred feudal power to Mussulman territories.\r\n\r\nOcean commerce assumed from this moment proportions hitherto unknown.\r\nNotwithstanding the papal bulls and decrees, which forbade Christians from\r\nhaving any connection with infidels, the voice of interest was more\r\nlistened to than that of the Church (Fig. 192), and traders did not fear\r\nto disobey the political and religions orders which forbade them to carry\r\narms and slaves to the enemies of the faith.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to foretell, from the very first, that the military occupation\r\nof the Holy Land would not be permanent. In consequence of this,\r\ntherefore, the nearer the loss of this fine conquest seemed to be, the\r\ngreater were the efforts made by the maritime towns of the West to\r\nre-establish, on a more solid and lasting basis, a commercial alliance\r\nwith Egypt, the country which they selected to replace Palestine, in a\r\nmercantile point of view. Marseilles was the greatest supporter of this\r\nintercourse with Egypt; and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries she\r\nreached a very high position, which she owed to her shipowners and\r\ntraders. In the fourteenth century, however, the princes of the house of\r\nAnjou ruined her like the rest of Provence, in the great and fruitless\r\nefforts which they made to recover the kingdom of Naples; and it was not\r\nuntil the reign of Louis XI. that the old Phoenician city recovered its\r\nmaritime and commercial prosperity (Fig. 193).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--Merchant Vessel in a Storm.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in the \"Grand Kalendrier et Compost des Bergers,\" in folio:\r\nprinted at Troyes, about 1490, by Nicolas de Rouge.[*]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote *: \"Mortal man, living in the world, is compared to a vessel\r\n  on perilous seas, bearing rich merchandise, by which, if it can come to\r\n  harbour, the merchant will be rendered rich and happy. The ship from the\r\n  commencement to the end of its voyage is in great peril of being lost or\r\n  taken by an enemy, for the seas are always beset with perils. So is the\r\n  body of man during its sojourn in the world. The merchandise he bears is\r\n  his soul, his virtues, and his good deeds. The harbour is paradise, and\r\n  he who reaches that haven is made supremely rich. The sea is the world,\r\n  full of vices and sins, and in which all, during their passage through\r\n  life, are in peril and danger of losing body and soul and of being\r\n  drowned in the infernal sea, from which God in His grace keep us!\r\n  Amen.\"]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.--View and Plan of Marseilles and its Harbour, in\r\nthe Sixteenth Century.--From a Copper-plate in the Collection of G. Bruin,\r\nin folio: \"Théâtre des Citez du Monde.\"]\r\n\r\nLanguedoc, depressed, and for a time nearly ruined in the thirteenth\r\ncentury by the effect of the wars of the Albigenses, was enabled,\r\nsubsequently, to recover itself. Béziers, Agde, Narbonne, and especially\r\nMontpellier, so quickly established important trading connections with all\r\nthe ports of the Mediterranean, that at the end of the fourteenth century\r\nconsuls were appointed at each of these towns, in order to protect and\r\ndirect their transmarine commerce. A traveller of the twelfth century,\r\nBenjamin de Tudèle, relates that in these ports, which were afterwards\r\ncalled the stepping stones to the Levant, every language in the world\r\nmight be heard.\r\n\r\nToulouse was soon on a par with the towns of Lower Languedoc, and the\r\nGaronne poured into the markets, not only the produce of Guienne, and of\r\nthe western parts of France, but also those of Flanders, Normandy, and\r\nEngland. We may observe, however, that Bordeaux, although placed in a most\r\nadvantageous position, at the mouth of the river, only possessed, when\r\nunder the English dominion, a very limited commerce, principally confined\r\nto the export of wines to Great Britain in exchange for corn, oil, &c.\r\n\r\nLa Rochelle, on the same coast, was much more flourishing at this period,\r\nowing to the numerous coasters which carried the wines of Aunis and\r\nSaintonge, and the salt of Brouage to Flanders, the Netherlands, and the\r\nnorth of Germany. Vitré already had its silk manufactories in the\r\nfifteenth century, and Nantes gave promise of her future greatness as a\r\ndepôt of maritime commerce. It was about this time also that the fisheries\r\nbecame a new industry, in which Bayonne and a few villages on the\r\nsea-coast took the lead, some being especially engaged in whaling, and\r\nothers in the cod and herring fisheries (Fig. 194).\r\n\r\nLong before this, Normandy had depended on other branches of trade for its\r\ncommercial prosperity. Its fabrics of woollen stuffs, its arms and\r\ncutlery, besides the agricultural productions of its fertile and\r\nwell-cultivated soil, each furnished material for export on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe towns of Rouen and Caen were especially manufacturing cities, and were\r\nvery rich. This was the case with Rouen particularly, which was situated\r\non the Seine, and was at that time an extensive depôt for provisions and\r\nother merchandise which was sent down the river for export, or was\r\nimported for future internal consumption. Already Paris, the abode of\r\nkings, and the metropolis of government, began to foreshadow the immense\r\ndevelopment which it was destined to undergo, by becoming the centre of\r\ncommercial affairs, and by daily adding to its labouring and mercantile\r\npopulation (Figs. 195 and 196).\r\n\r\nIt was, however, outside the walls of Paris that commerce, which needed\r\nliberty as well as protection, at first progressed most rapidly. The\r\nnorthern provinces had early united manufacturing industry with traffic,\r\nand this double source of local prosperity was the origin of their\r\nenormous wealth. Ghent and Bruges in the Low Countries, and Beauvais and\r\nArras, were celebrated for their manufacture of cloths, carpets, and\r\nserge, and Cambrai for its fine cloths. The artizans and merchants of\r\nthese industrious cities then established their powerful corporations,\r\nwhose unwearied energy gave rise to that commercial freedom so favourable\r\nto trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194. Whale-Fishing. Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the\r\n\"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Thevet, in folio: Paris, 1574.]\r\n\r\nMore important than the woollen manufactures--for the greater part of the\r\nwool used was brought from England--was the manufacture of flax, inasmuch\r\nas it encouraged agriculture, the raw material being produced in France.\r\nThis first flourished in the north-east of France, and spread slowly to\r\nPicardy, to Beauvois, and Brittany. The central countries, with the\r\nexception of Bruges, whose cloth manufactories were already celebrated in\r\nthe fifteenth century, remained essentially agricultural; and their\r\nprincipal towns were merely depôts for imported goods. The institution of\r\nfairs, however, rendered, it is true, this commerce of some of the towns\r\nas wide-spread as it was productive. In the Middle Ages religious feasts\r\nand ceremonials almost always gave rise to fairs, which commerce was not\r\nslow in multiplying as much as possible. The merchants naturally came to\r\nexhibit their goods where the largest concourse of people afforded the\r\ngreatest promise of their readily disposing of them. As early as the first\r\ndynasty of Merovingian kings, temporary and periodical markets of this\r\nkind existed; but, except at St. Denis, articles of local consumption only\r\nwere brought to them. The reasons for this were, the heavy taxes which\r\nwere levied by the feudal lords on all merchandise exhibited for sale, and\r\nthe danger which foreign merchants ran of being plundered on their way, or\r\neven at the fair itself. These causes for a long time delayed the progress\r\nof an institution which was afterwards destined to become so useful and\r\nbeneficial to all classes of the community.\r\n\r\nWe have several times mentioned the famous fair of Landit, which is\r\nsupposed to have been established by Charlemagne, but which no doubt was a\r\nsort of revival of the fairs of St. Denis, founded by Dagobert, and which\r\nfor a time had fallen into disuse in the midst of the general ruin which\r\npreceded that emperor's reign. This fair of Landit was renowned over the\r\nwhole of Europe, and attracted merchants from all countries. It was held\r\nin the month of June, and only lasted fifteen days. Goods of all sorts,\r\nboth of home and foreign manufacture, were sold, but the sale of parchment\r\nwas the principal object of the fair, to purchase a supply of which the\r\nUniversity of Paris regularly went in procession. On account of its\r\nspecial character, this fair was of less general importance than the six\r\nothers, which from the twelfth century were held at Troyes, Provins,\r\nLagny-sur-Marne, Rheims, and Bar-sur-Aube. These infused so much\r\ncommercial vitality into the province of Champagne, that the nobles for\r\nthe most part shook off the prejudice which forbad their entering into any\r\nsort of trading association.\r\n\r\nFairs multiplied in the centre and in the south of France simultaneously.\r\nThose of Puy-en-Velay, now the capital of the Haute-Loire, are looked upon\r\nas the most ancient, and they preserved their old reputation and attracted\r\na considerable concourse of people, which was also increased by the\r\npilgrimages then made to Notre-Dame du Puy. These fairs, which were more\r\nof a religious than of a commercial character, were then of less\r\nimportance as regards trade than those held at Beaucaire. This town rose\r\nto great repute in the thirteenth century, and, with the Lyons market,\r\nbecame at that time the largest centre of commerce in the southern\r\nprovinces. Placed at the junction of the Saóne and the Rhône, Lyons owed\r\nits commercial development to the proximity of Marseilles and the towns of\r\nItaly. Its four annual fairs were always much frequented, and when the\r\nkings of France transferred to it the privileges of the fairs of\r\nChampagne, and transplanted to within its walls the silk manufactories\r\nformerly established at Tours, Lyons really became the second city of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--Measurers of Corn in Paris.\r\n\r\nFig. 196.--Hay Carriers.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of Woodcuts from the \"Royal Orders concerning the Jurisdiction\r\nof the Company of Merchants and Shrievalty in the City of Paris,\" in small\r\nfolio goth.: Jacques Nyverd, 1528.]\r\n\r\nIt may be asserted as an established fact that the gradual extension of\r\nthe power of the king, produced by the fall of feudalism, was favourable\r\nto the extension of commerce. As early as the reign of Louis IX. many laws\r\nand regulations prove that the kings were alive to the importance of\r\ntrade. Among the chief enactments was one which led to the formation of\r\nthe harbour of Aigues-Mortes on the Mediterranean; another to the\r\npublication of the book of \"Weights and Measures,\" by Etienne Boileau, a\r\nwork in which the ancient statutes of the various trades were arranged and\r\ncodified; and a third to the enactment made in the very year of this\r\nking's death, to guarantee the security of vendors, and, at the same time,\r\nto ensure purchasers against fraud. All these bear undoubted witness that\r\nan enlightened policy in favour of commerce had already sprung up.\r\n\r\nPhilippe le Bel issued several prohibitory enactments also in the interest\r\nof home commerce and local industry, which Louis X. confirmed. Philippe le\r\nLong attempted even to outdo the judicious efforts of Louis XI., and\r\ntried, though unsuccessfully, to establish a uniformity in the weights and\r\nmeasures throughout the kingdom; a reform, however, which was never\r\naccomplished until the revolution of 1789. It is difficult to credit how\r\nmany different weights and measures were in use at that time, each one\r\nvarying according to local custom or the choice of the lord of the soil,\r\nwho probably in some way profited by the confusion which this uncertain\r\nstate of things must have produced. The fraud and errors to which this led\r\nmay easily be imagined, particularly in the intercourse between one part\r\nof the country and another. The feudal stamp is here thoroughly exhibited;\r\nas M. Charles de Grandmaison remarks, \"Nothing is fixed, nothing is\r\nuniform, everything is special and arbitrary, settled by the lord of the\r\nsoil by virtue of his right of _justesse_, by which he undertook the\r\nregulation and superintendence of the weights and measures in use in his\r\nlordship.\"\r\n\r\nMeasures of length and contents often differed much from one another,\r\nalthough they might be similarly named, and it would require very\r\ncomplicated comparative tables approximately to fix their value. The _pied\r\nde roi_ was from ten to twelve inches, and was the least varying measure.\r\nThe fathom differed much in different parts, and in the attempt to\r\ndetermine the relations between the innumerable measures of contents which\r\nwe find recorded--a knowledge of which must have been necessary for the\r\ncommerce of the period--we are stopped by a labyrinth of incomprehensible\r\ncalculations, which it is impossible to determine with any degree of\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe weights were more uniform and less uncertain. The pound was everywhere\r\nin use, but it was not everywhere of the same standard (Fig. 201). For\r\ninstance, at Paris it weighed sixteen ounces, whereas at Lyons it only\r\nweighed fourteen; and in weighing silk fifteen ounces to the pound was\r\nthe rule. At Toulouse and in Upper Languedoc the pound was only thirteen\r\nand a half ounces; at Marseilles, thirteen ounces; and at other places it\r\neven fell to twelve ounces. There was in Paris a public scale called\r\n_poids du roi_; but this scale, though a most important means of revenue,\r\nwas a great hindrance to retail trade.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these petty and irritating impediments, the commerce of France\r\nextended throughout the whole world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.--View of Lubeck and its Harbour (Sixteenth\r\nCentury).--From a Copper-plate in the Work of P. Bertius, \"Commentaria\r\nRerum Germanicarum,\" in 4to: Amsterdam, 1616.]\r\n\r\nThe compass--known in Italy as early as the twelfth century, but little\r\nused until the fourteenth--enabled the mercantile navy to discover new\r\nroutes, and it was thus that true maritime commerce may be said regularly\r\nto have begun. The sailors of the Mediterranean, with the help of this\r\nlittle instrument, dared to pass the Straits of Gibraltar, and to venture\r\non the ocean. From that moment commercial intercourse, which had\r\npreviously only existed by land, and that with great difficulty, was\r\npermanently established between the northern and southern harbours of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nFlanders was the central port for merchant vessels, which arrived in great\r\nnumbers from the Mediterranean, and Bruges became the principal depôt.\r\nThe Teutonic league, the origin of which dates from the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and which formed the most powerful confederacy recorded in\r\nhistory, also sent innumerable vessels from its harbours of Lubeck (Fig.\r\n197) and Hamburg. These carried the merchandise of the northern countries\r\ninto Flanders, and this rich province, which excelled in every branch of\r\nindustry, and especially in those relating to metals and weaving, became\r\nthe great market of Europe (Fig. 198).\r\n\r\nThe commercial movement, formerly limited to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, extended to all parts, and gradually became universal. The\r\nnorthern states shared in it, and England, which for a long time kept\r\naloof from a stage on which it was destined to play the first part, began\r\nto give indications of its future commercial greatness. The number of\r\ntransactions increased as the facility for carrying them on became\r\ngreater. Consumption being extended, production progressively followed,\r\nand so commerce went on gaining strength as it widened its sphere.\r\nEverything, in fact, seemed to contribute to its expansion. The downfall\r\nof the feudal system and the establishment in each country of a central\r\npower, more or less strong and respected, enabled it to extend its\r\noperations by land with a degree of security hitherto unknown; and, at the\r\nsame time, international legislation came in to protect maritime trade,\r\nwhich was still exposed to great dangers. The sea, which was open freely\r\nto the whole human race, gave robbers comparatively easy means of\r\nfollowing their nefarious practices, and with less fear of punishment than\r\nthey could obtain on the shore of civilised countries. For this reason\r\npiracy continued its depredations long after the enactment of severe laws\r\nfor its suppression.\r\n\r\nThis maritime legislation did not wait for the sixteenth century to come\r\ninto existence. Maritime law was promulgated more or less in the twelfth\r\ncentury, but the troubles and agitations which weakened and disorganized\r\nempires during that period of the Middle Ages, deprived it of its power\r\nand efficiency. The _Code des Rhodiens_ dates as far back as 1167; the\r\n_Code de la Mer_, which became a sort of recognised text-book, dates from\r\nthe same period; the _Lois d'Oléron_ is anterior to the twelfth century,\r\nand ruled the western coasts of France, being also adopted in Flanders and\r\nin England; Venice dated her most ancient law on maritime rights from\r\n1255, and the Statutes of Marseilles date from 1254.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.--Execution of the celebrated pirate Stoertebeck\r\nand his seventy accomplices, in 1402, at Hamburg.--From a popular Picture\r\nof the end of the Sixteenth Century (Hamburg Library).]\r\n\r\nThe period of the establishment of commercial law and justice\r\ncorresponds with that of the introduction of national and universal codes\r\nof law and consular jurisdiction. These may be said to have originated in\r\nthe sixth century in the laws of the Visigoths, which empowered foreign\r\ntraders to be judged by delegates from their own countries. The Venetians\r\nhad consuls in the Greek empire as early as the tenth century, and we may\r\nfairly presume that the French had consuls in Palestine during the reign\r\nof Charlemagne. In the thirteenth century the towns of Italy had consular\r\nagents in France; and Marseilles had them in Savoy, in Arles, and in\r\nGenoa. Thus traders of each country were always sure of finding justice,\r\nassistance, and protection in all the centres of European commerce.\r\n\r\nNumerous facilities for barter were added to these advantages. Merchants,\r\nwho at first travelled with their merchandise, and who afterwards merely\r\nsent a factor as their representative, finally consigned it to foreign\r\nagents. Communication by correspondence in this way became more general,\r\nand paper replaced parchment as being less rare and less expensive. The\r\nintroduction of Arabic figures, which were more convenient than the Roman\r\nnumerals for making calculations, the establishment of banks, of which the\r\nmost ancient was in operation in Venice as early as the twelfth century,\r\nthe invention of bills of exchange, attributed to the Jews, and generally\r\nin use in the thirteenth century, the establishment of insurance against\r\nthe risks and perils of sea and land, and lastly, the formation of trading\r\ncompanies, or what are now called partnerships, all tended to give\r\nexpansion and activity to commerce, whereby public and private wealth was\r\nincreased in spite of obstacles which routine, envy, and ill-will\r\npersistently raised against great commercial enterprises.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the French, through indolence or antipathy--for it was\r\nmore to their liking to be occupied with arms and chivalry than with\r\nmatters of interest and profit--took but a feeble part in the trade which\r\nwas carried on so successfully on their own territory. The nobles were\r\nashamed to mix in commerce, considering it unworthy of them, and the\r\nbourgeois, for want of liberal feeling and expansiveness in their ideas,\r\nwere satisfied with appropriating merely local trade. Foreign commerce,\r\neven of the most lucrative description, was handed over to foreigners, and\r\nespecially to Jews, who were often banished from the kingdom and as\r\nfrequently ransomed, though universally despised and hated.\r\nNotwithstanding this, they succeeded in rising to wealth under the stigma\r\nof shame and infamy, and the immense gains which they realised by means of\r\nusury reconciled them to, and consoled them for, the ill-treatment to\r\nwhich they were subjected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.--Discovery of America, 12th of May,\r\n1492.--Columbus erects the Cross and baptizes the Isle of Guanahani (now\r\nCat Island, one of the Bahamas) by the Christian Name of St.\r\nSalvador.--From a Stamp engraved on Copper by Th. de Bry, in the\r\nCollection of \"Grands Voyages,\" in folio, 1590.]\r\n\r\nAt a very early period, and especially when the Jews had been absolutely\r\nexpelled, the advantage of exclusively trading with and securing the rich\r\nprofits from France had attracted the Italians, who were frequently only\r\nJews in disguise, concealing themselves as to their character under the\r\ngeneric name of Lombards. It was under this name that the French kings\r\ngave them on different occasions various privileges, when they frequented\r\nthe fairs of Champagne and came to establish themselves in the inland and\r\nseaport towns. These Italians constituted the great corporation of\r\nmoney-changers in Paris, and hoarded in their coffers all the coin of the\r\nkingdom, and in this way caused a perpetual variation in the value of\r\nmoney, by which they themselves benefited.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the wars of Italy rather changed matters, and we\r\nfind royal and important concessions increasing in favour of Castilians\r\nand other Spaniards, whom the people maliciously called _negroes_, and who\r\nhad emigrated in order to engage in commerce and manufactures in\r\nSaintonge, Normandy, Burgundy, Agenois, and Languedoc.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of Louis XI., the French, becoming more alive to their true\r\ninterests, began to manage their own affairs, following the suggestions\r\nand advice of the King, whose democratic instincts prompted him to\r\nencourage and favour the bourgeois. This result was also attributable to\r\nthe state of peace and security which then began to exist in the kingdom,\r\nimpoverished and distracted as it had been by a hundred years of domestic\r\nand foreign warfare.\r\n\r\nFrom 1365 to 1382 factories and warehouses were founded by Norman\r\nnavigators on the western coast of Africa, in Senegal and Guinea. Numerous\r\nfleets of merchantmen, of great size for those days, were employed in\r\ntransporting cloth, grain of all kinds, knives, brandy, salt, and other\r\nmerchandise, which were bartered for leather, ivory, gum, amber, and gold\r\ndust. Considerable profits were realised by the shipowners and merchants,\r\nwho, like Jacques Coeur, employed ships for the purpose of carrying on\r\nthese large and lucrative commercial operations. These facts sufficiently\r\ntestify the condition of France at this period, and prove that this, like\r\nother branches of human industry, was arrested in its expansion by the\r\npolitical troubles which followed in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nFortunately these social troubles were not universal, and it was just at\r\nthe period when France was struggling and had become exhausted and\r\nimpoverished that the Portuguese extended their discoveries on the same\r\ncoast of Africa, and soon after succeeded in rounding the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and opening a new maritime road to India, a country which was always\r\nattractive from the commercial advantages which it offered.\r\n\r\nSome years after, Christopher Columbus, the Genoese, more daring and more\r\nfortunate still, guided by the compass and impelled by his own genius,\r\ndiscovered a new continent, the fourth continent of the world (Fig. 199).\r\nThis unexpected event, the greatest and most remarkable of the age,\r\nnecessarily enlarged the field for produce as well as for consumption to\r\nan enormous extent, and naturally added, not only to the variety and\r\nquantity of exchangeable wares, but also to the production of the precious\r\nmetals, and brought about a complete revolution in the laws of the whole\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\nMaritime commerce immediately acquired an extraordinary development, and\r\nmerchants, forsaking the harbours of the Mediterranean, and even those of\r\nthe Levant, which then seemed to them scarcely worthy of notice, sent\r\ntheir vessels by thousands upon the ocean in pursuit of the wonderful\r\nriches of the New World. The day of caravans and coasting had passed;\r\nVenice had lost its splendour; the sway of the Mediterranean was over; the\r\ncommerce of the world was suddenly transferred from the active and\r\nindustrious towns of that sea, which had so long monopolized it, to the\r\nWestern nations, to the Portuguese and Spaniards first, and then to the\r\nDutch and English.\r\n\r\nFrance, absorbed in, and almost ruined by civil war, and above all by\r\nreligious dissensions, only played a subordinate part in this commercial\r\nand pacific revolution, although it has been said that the sailors of\r\nDieppe and Honfleur really discovered America before Columbus.\r\nNevertheless the kings of France, Louis XII., Francis I., and Henry II.,\r\ntried to establish and encourage transatlantic voyages, and to create, in\r\nthe interest of French commerce, colonies on the coasts of the New World,\r\nfrom Florida and Virginia to Canada.\r\n\r\nBut these colonies had but a precarious and transitory existence;\r\nfisheries alone succeeded, and French commerce continued insignificant,\r\ncircumscribed, and domestic, notwithstanding the increasing requirements\r\nof luxury at court. This luxury contented itself with the use of the\r\nmerchandise which arrived from the Low Countries, Spain, and Italy.\r\nNational industry did all in its power to surmount this ignominious\r\ncondition; she specially turned her attention to the manufacture of silks\r\nand of stuffs tissued with gold and silver. The only practical attempt of\r\nthe government in the sixteenth century to protect commerce and\r\nmanufactures was to forbid the import of foreign merchandise, and to\r\nendeavour to oppose the progress of luxury by rigid enactments.\r\n\r\nCertainly the government of that time little understood the advantages\r\nwhich a country derived from commerce when it forbade the higher classes\r\nfrom engaging in mercantile pursuits under penalty of having their\r\nprivileges of nobility withdrawn from them. In the face of the examples of\r\nItaly, Genoa, Venice, and especially of Florence, where the nobles were\r\nall traders or sons of traders, the kings of the line of Valois thought\r\nproper to make this enactment. The desire seemed to be to make the\r\nmerchant class a separate class, stationary, and consisting exclusively of\r\nbourgeois, shut up in their counting-houses, and prevented in every way\r\nfrom participating in public life. The merchants became indignant at this\r\nbanishment, and, in order to employ their leisure, they plunged with all\r\ntheir energy into the sanguinary struggles of Reform and of the League.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.--Medal to commemorate the Association of the\r\nMerchants of the City of Rouen.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the reign of Henry IV. that they again confined\r\nthemselves to their occupations as merchants, when Sully published the\r\npolitical suggestions of his master for renewing commercial prosperity.\r\nFrom this time a new era commenced in the commercial destiny of France.\r\nCommerce, fostered and protected by statesmen, sought to extend its\r\noperations with greater freedom and power. Companies were formed at Paris,\r\nMarseilles, Lyons, and Rouen to carry French merchandise all over the\r\nworld, and the rules of the mercantile associations, in spite of the\r\nroutine and jealousies which guided the trade corporations, became the\r\ncode which afterwards regulated commerce (Fig. 200).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Standard Weight in Brass of the Fish-market at\r\nMans: Sign of the Syren (End of the Sixteenth Century).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuilds and Trade Corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Uncertain Origin of Corporations.--Ancient Industrial Associations.--The\r\n  Germanic Guild.--Colleges.--Teutonic Associations.--The Paris Company\r\n  for the Transit of Merchandise by Water.--Corporations properly so\r\n  called.--Etienne Boileau's \"Book of Trades,\" or the First Code of\r\n  Regulations.--The Laws governing Trades.--Public and Private\r\n  Organization of Trade Corporations and other Communities.--Energy of the\r\n  Corporations.--Masters, Journeymen, Supernumeraries, and\r\n  Apprentices.--Religious Festivals and Trade Societies.--Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearned authorities have frequently discussed, without agreeing, on the\r\nquestion of the origin of the Corporations of the Middle Ages. It may be\r\nadmitted, we think _à priori_, that associations of artisans were as\r\nancient as the trades themselves. It may readily be imagined that the\r\nnumerous members of the industrial classes, having to maintain and defend\r\ntheir common rights and common interests, would have sought to establish\r\nmutual fraternal associations among themselves. The deeper we dive into\r\nancient history the clearer we perceive traces, more or less distinct, of\r\nthese kinds of associations. To cite only two examples, which may serve to\r\nsome extent as an historical parallel to the analogous institutions of the\r\npresent day, we may mention the Roman _Colleges_, which were really\r\nleagues of artisans following the same calling; and the Scandinavian\r\nguilds, whose object was to assimilate the different branches of industry\r\nand trade, either of a city or of some particular district.\r\n\r\nIndeed, brotherhoods amongst the labouring classes always existed under\r\nthe German conquerors from the moment when Europe, so long divided into\r\nRoman provinces, shook off the yoke of subjection to Rome, although she\r\nstill adhered to the laws and customs of the nation which had held her in\r\nsubjection for so many generations. We can, however, only regard the few\r\ntraces which remain of these brotherhoods as evidence of their having\r\nonce existed, and not as indicative of their having been in a flourishing\r\nstate. In the fifth century, the Hermit Ampelius, in his \"Legends of the\r\nSaints,\" mentions _Consuls_ or Chiefs of Locksmiths. The Corporation of\r\nGoldsmiths is spoken of as existing in the first dynasty of the French\r\nkings. Bakers are named collectively in 630 in the laws of Dagobert, which\r\nseems to show that they formed a sort of trade union at that remote\r\nperiod. We also see Charlemagne, in several of his statutes, taking steps\r\nin order that the number of persons engaged in providing food of different\r\nkinds should everywhere be adequate to provide for the necessities of\r\nconsumption, which would tend to show a general organization of that most\r\nimportant branch of industry. In Lombardy colleges of artisans were\r\nestablished at an early period, and were, no doubt, on the model of the\r\nRoman ones. Ravenna, in 943, possessed a College of Fishermen; and ten\r\nyears later the records of that town mention a _Chief of the Corporation\r\nof Traders_, and, in 1001, a _Chief of the Corporation of Butchers_.\r\nFrance at the same time kept up a remembrance of the institutions of Roman\r\nGaul, and the ancient colleges of trades still formed associations and\r\ncompanies in Paris and in the larger towns. In 1061 King Philip I. granted\r\ncertain privileges to Master Chandlers and Oilmen. The ancient customs of\r\nthe butchers are mentioned as early as the time of Louis VII., 1162. The\r\nsame king granted to the wife of Ives Laccobre and her heirs the\r\ncollectorship of the dues which were payable by tanners, purse-makers,\r\ncurriers, and shoemakers. Under Philip Augustus similar concessions became\r\nmore frequent, and it is evident that at that time trade was beginning to\r\ntake root and to require special and particular administration. This led\r\nto regulations being drawn up for each trade, to which Philip Augustus\r\ngave his sanction. In 1182 he confirmed the statutes of the butchers, and\r\nthe furriers and drapers also obtained favourable concessions from him.\r\n\r\nAccording to the learned Augustin Thierry, corporations, like civic\r\ncommunities, were engrafted on previously existing guilds, such as on the\r\ncolleges or corporations of workmen, which were of Roman origin. In the\r\n_guild_, which signifies a banquet at common expense, there was a mutual\r\nassurance against misfortunes and injuries of all sorts, such as fire and\r\nshipwreck, and also against all lawsuits incurred for offences and crimes,\r\neven though they were proved against the accused. Each of these\r\nassociations was placed under the patronage of a god or of a hero, and\r\nhad its compulsory statutes; each had its chief or president chosen from\r\namong the members, and a common treasury supplied by annual contributions.\r\nRoman colleges, as we have already stated, were established with a more\r\nspecial purpose, and were more exclusively confined to the peculiar trade\r\nto which they belonged; but these, equally with the guilds, possessed a\r\ncommon exchequer, enjoyed equal rights and privileges, elected their own\r\npresidents, and celebrated in common their sacrifices, festivals, and\r\nbanquets. We have, therefore, good reason for agreeing in the opinion of\r\nthe celebrated historian, who considers that in the establishment of a\r\ncorporation \"the guild should be to a certain degree the motive power, and\r\nthe Roman college, with its organization, the material which should be\r\nused to bring it into existence.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.--Craftsmen in the Fourteenth Century--Fac-simile\r\nof a Miniature of a Manuscript in the Library of Brussels.]\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that during several centuries corporations were\r\neither dissolved or hidden from public notice, for they almost entirely\r\ndisappeared from the historic records during the partial return to\r\nbarbarism, when the production of objects of daily necessity and the\r\npreparation of food were entrusted to slaves under the eye of their\r\nmaster. Not till the twelfth century did they again begin to flourish,\r\nand, as might be supposed, it was Italy which gave the signal for the\r\nresuscitation of the institutions whose birthplace had been Rome, and\r\nwhich barbarism had allowed to fall into decay. Brotherhoods of artisans\r\nwere also founded at an early period in the north of Gaul, whence they\r\nrapidly spread beyond the Rhine. Under the Emperor Henry I., that is,\r\nduring the tenth century, the ordinary condition of artisans in Germany\r\nwas still serfdom; but two centuries later the greater number of trades in\r\nmost of the large towns of the empire had congregated together in colleges\r\nor bodies under the name of unions (_Einnungen_ or _Innungen_) (Fig. 202),\r\nas, for example, at Gozlar, at Würzburg, at Brunswick, &c. These colleges,\r\nhowever, were not established without much difficulty and without the\r\nenergetic resistance of the ruling powers, inasmuch as they often raised\r\ntheir pretensions so high as to wish to substitute their authority for the\r\nsenatorial law, and thus to grasp the government of the cities. The\r\nthirteenth century witnessed obstinate and sanguinary feuds between these\r\ntwo parties, each of which was alternately victorious. Whichever had the\r\nupper hand took advantage of the opportunity to carry out the most cruel\r\nreprisals against its defeated opponents. The Emperors Frederick II. and\r\nHenry VII. tried to put an end to these strifes by abolishing the\r\ncorporations of workmen, but these powerful associations fearlessly\r\nopposed the imperial authority. In France the organization of communities\r\nof artisans, an organization which in many ways was connected with the\r\ncommercial movement, but which must not be confounded with it, did not\r\ngive rise to any political difficulty. It seems not even to have met with\r\nany opposition from the feudal powers, who no doubt found it an easy\r\npretext for levying additional rates and taxes.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient of these corporations was the Parisian _Hanse_, or\r\ncorporation of the bourgeois for canal navigation, which probably dates\r\nits origin back to the college of Parisian _Nautes_, existing before the\r\nRoman conquest. This mercantile association held its meetings in the\r\nisland of Lutetia, on the very spot where the church of Notre-Dame was\r\nafterwards built. From the earliest days of monarchy tradesmen constituted\r\nentirely the bourgeois of the towns (Fig. 203). Above them were the\r\nnobility or clergy, beneath them the artisans. Hence we can understand how\r\nthe bourgeois, who during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were a\r\ndistinct section of the community, became at last the important commercial\r\nbody itself. The kings invariably treated them with favour. Louis VI.\r\ngranted them new rights, Louis VII. confirmed their ancient privileges,\r\nand Philip Augustus increased them. The Parisian Hanse succeeded in\r\nmonopolising all the commerce which was carried on by water on the Seine\r\nand the Yonne between Mantes and Auxerre. No merchandise coming up or down\r\nthe stream in boats could be disembarked in the interior of Paris without\r\nbecoming, as it were, the property of the corporation, which, through its\r\nagents, superintended its measurement and its sale in bulk, and, up to a\r\ncertain point, its sale by retail. No foreign merchant was permitted to\r\nsend his goods to Paris without first obtaining _lettres de Hanse_,\r\nwhereby he had associated with him a bourgeois of the town, who acted as\r\nhis guarantee, and who shared in his profits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.--Merchants or Tradesmen of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Library at\r\nBrussels.]\r\n\r\nThere were associations of the same kind in most of the commercial towns\r\nsituated on the banks of rivers and on the sea-coast, as, for example, at\r\nRouen, Arles, Marseilles, Narbonne, Toulouse, Ratisbon, Augsburg, and\r\nUtrecht. Sometimes neighbouring towns, such as the great manufacturing\r\ncities of Flanders, agreed together and entered into a leagued bond, which\r\ngave them greater power, and constituted an offensive and defensive\r\ncompact (Fig. 204). A typical example of this last institution is that of\r\nthe commercial association of the _Hanseatic Towns_ of Germany, which were\r\ngrouped together to the number of eighty around their four capitals, viz.,\r\nLubeck, Cologne, Dantzic, and Brunswick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.--Seal of the United Trades of Ghent (End of the\r\nFifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have already seen, previous to the thirteenth century many\r\nof the corporations of artisans had been authorised by several of the\r\nkings of France to make special laws whereby they might govern themselves,\r\nit was really only from the reign of St. Louis that the first general\r\nmeasures of administration and police relating to these communities can be\r\ndated. The King appointed Etienne Boileau, a rich bourgeois, provost of\r\nthe capital in 1261, to set to work to establish order, wise\r\nadministration, and \"good faith\" in the commerce of Paris. To this end he\r\nascertained from the verbal testimony of the senior members of each\r\ncorporation the customs and usages of the various crafts, which for the\r\nmost part up to that time had not been committed to writing. He arranged\r\nand probably amended them in many ways, and thus composed the famous \"Book\r\nof Trades,\" which, as M. Depping, the able editor of this valuable\r\ncompilation, first published in 1837, says, \"has the advantage of being to\r\na great extent the genuine production of the corporations themselves, and\r\nnot a list of rules established and framed by the municipal or judicial\r\nauthorities.\" From that time corporations gradually introduced themselves\r\ninto the order of society. The royal decrees in their favour were\r\nmultiplied, and the regulations with regard to mechanical trades daily\r\nimproved, not only in Paris and in the provinces, and also abroad, both in\r\nthe south and in the north of Europe, especially in Italy, Germany,\r\nEngland, and the Low Countries (Figs. 205 to 213).\r\n\r\nEtienne Boileau's \"Book of Trades\" contained the rules of one hundred\r\ndifferent trade associations. It must be observed, however, that several\r\nof the most important trades, such as the butchers, tanners, glaziers,\r\n&c., were omitted, either because they neglected to be registered at the\r\nChâtelet, where the inquiry superintended by Boileau was made, or because\r\nsome private interest induced them to keep aloof from this registration,\r\nwhich probably imposed some sort of fine and a tax upon them. In the\r\nfollowing century the number of trade associations considerably increased,\r\nand wonderfully so during the reigns of the last of the Valois and the\r\nfirst of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the antiquities of Paris, Henry Sauval, enumerated no\r\nfewer than fifteen hundred and fifty-one trade associations in the capital\r\nalone in the middle of the seventeenth century. It must be remarked,\r\nhowever, that the societies of artisans were much subdivided owing to the\r\nsimple fact that each craft could only practise its own special work.\r\nThus, in Boileau's book, we find four different corporations of\r\n_patenôtriers_, or makers of chaplets, six of hatters, six of weavers, &c.\r\n\r\nBesides these societies of artisans, there were in Paris a few privileged\r\ncorporations, which occupied a more important position, and were known\r\nunder the name of _Corps des Marchands_. Their number at first frequently\r\nvaried, but finally it was settled at six, and they were termed _les Six\r\nCorps_. They comprised the drapers, which always took precedence of the\r\nfive others, the grocers, the mercers, the furriers, the hatters, and the\r\ngoldsmiths. These five for a long time disputed the question of\r\nprecedence, and finally they decided the matter by lot, as they were not\r\nable to agree in any other way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.--Seal of the Corporation of Carpenters of St.\r\nTrond (Belgium)--From an Impression preserved in the Archives of that Town\r\n(1481).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.--Seal of the Corporation of Shoemakers of St.\r\nTrond, from a Map of 1481, preserved in the Archives of that Town.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.--Seal of the Corporation of Wool-weavers of\r\nHasselt (Belgium), from a Parchment Title-deed of June 25, 1574.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.--Seal of the Corporation of Clothworkers of\r\nBruges (1356).--From an Impression preserved in the Archives of that\r\nTown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.--Seal of the Corporation of Fullers of St. Trond\r\n(about 1350).--From an Impression preserved in the Archives of that Town.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.--Seal of the Corporation of Joiners of Bruges\r\n(1356).--From an Impression preserved in the Archives of that Town.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.--Token of the Corporation of Carpenters of\r\nMaestricht.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.--Token of the Corporation of Carpenters of\r\nAntwerp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.--Funeral Token of the Corporation of Carpenters\r\nof Maestricht.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTrades.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of Engravings on Wood, designed and engraved by J.

It is clear, however, that these six bodies were imbued with a\r\nkind of aristocratic spirit which made them place trading much above\r\nhandicraft in their own class, and set a high value on their calling as\r\nmerchants. Thus contemporary historians tell us that any merchant who\r\ncompromised the dignity of the company \"fell into the class of the lower\r\norders;\" that mercers boasted of excluding from their body the\r\nupholsterers, \"who were but artisans;\" that hatters, who were admitted\r\ninto the _Six Corps_ to replace one of the other trades, became in\r\nconsequence \"merchants instead of artisans, which they had been up to that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the statutes so carefully compiled and revised by Etienne\r\nBoileau and his successors, and in spite of the numerous arbitrary rules\r\nwhich the sovereigns, the magistrates, and the corporations themselves\r\nstrenuously endeavoured to frame, order and unity were far from governing\r\nthe commerce and industry of Paris during the Middle Ages, and what took\r\nplace in Paris generally repeated itself elsewhere. Serious disputes\r\ncontinually arose between the authorities and those amenable to their\r\njurisdiction, and between the various crafts themselves, notwithstanding\r\nthe relation which they bore to each other from the similarity of their\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\nIn fact in this, as in many other matters, social disorder often emanated\r\nfrom the powers whose duty it was in the first instance to have repressed\r\nit. Thus, at the time when Philip Augustus extended the boundaries of his\r\ncapital so as to include the boroughs in it, which until then had been\r\nseparated from the city, the lay and clerical lords, under whose feudal\r\ndominion those districts had hitherto been placed, naturally insisted upon\r\npreserving all their rights. So forcibly did they do this that the King\r\nwas obliged to recognise their claims; and in several boroughs, including\r\nthe Bourg l'Abbé, the Beau Bourg, the Bourg St. Germain, and the Bourg\r\nAuxerrois, &c., there were trade associations completely distinct from and\r\nindependent of those of ancient Paris. If we simply limit our examination\r\nto that of the condition of the trade associations which held their\r\nauthority immediately from royalty, we still see that the causes of\r\nconfusion were by no means trifling; for the majority of the high officers\r\nof the crown, acting as delegates of the royal authority, were always\r\ndisputing amongst themselves the right of superintending, protecting,\r\njudging, punishing, and, above all, of exacting tribute from the members\r\nof the various trades. The King granted to various officers the privilege\r\nof arbitrarily disposing of the freedom of each trade for their own\r\nprofit, and thereby gave them power over all the merchants and craftsmen\r\nwho were officially connected with them, not only in Paris, but also\r\nthroughout the whole kingdom. Thus the lord chamberlain had jurisdiction\r\nover the drapers, mercers, furriers, shoemakers, tailors, and other\r\ndealers in articles of wearing apparel; the barbers were governed by the\r\nking's varlet and barber; the head baker was governor over the bakers; and\r\nthe head butler over the wine merchants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.--Group of Goldsmiths preceding the _Chasse de St.\r\nMarcel_ in the Reign of Louis XIII.--From a Copper-plate of the Period\r\n(Cabinet of Stamps in the National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThese state officers granted freedoms to artisans, or, in other words,\r\nthey gave them the right to exercise such and such a craft with assistants\r\nor companions, exacting for the performance of this trifling act a very\r\nconsiderable tax. And, as they preferred receiving their revenues without\r\nthe annoyance of having direct communication with their humble subjects,\r\nthey appointed deputies, who were authorised to collect them in their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of these deputies were the _rois des merciers_, who\r\nlived on the fat of the land in complete idleness, and who were surrounded\r\nby a mercantile court, which appeared in all its splendour at the trade\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.--Banner of the Corporation of the United Boot and\r\nShoe Makers of Issoudun.]\r\n\r\nThe great officers of the crown exercised in their own interests, and\r\nwithout a thought for the public advantage, a complete magisterial\r\njurisdiction over all crafts; they adjudicated in disputes arising between\r\nmasters and men, decided quarrels, visited, either personally or through\r\ntheir deputies, the houses of the merchants, in order to discover frauds\r\nor infractions in the rules of the trade, and levied fines accordingly. We\r\nmust remember that the collectors of court dues had always to contend for\r\nthe free exercise of their jurisdiction against the provost of Paris, who\r\nconsidered their acquisitions of authority as interfering with his\r\npersonal prerogatives, and who therefore persistently opposed them on all\r\noccasions. For instance, if the head baker ordered an artisan of the same\r\ntrade to be imprisoned in the Châtelet, the high provost, who was governor\r\nof the prison, released him immediately; and, in retaliation, if the high\r\nprovost punished a baker, the chief baker warmly espoused his\r\nsubordinate's cause. At other times the artisans, if they were\r\ndissatisfied with the deputy appointed by the great officer of the crown,\r\nwhose dependents they were, would refuse to recognise his authority. In\r\nthis way constant quarrels and interminable lawsuits occurred, and it is\r\neasy to understand the disorder which must have arisen from such a state\r\nof things. By degrees, however, and in consequence of the new tendencies\r\nof royalty, which were simply directed to the diminution of feudal power,\r\nthe numerous jurisdictions relating to the various trades gradually\r\nreturned to the hand of the municipal provostship; and this concentration\r\nof power had the best results, as well for the public good as for that of\r\nthe corporations themselves.\r\n\r\nHaving examined into corporations collectively and also into their general\r\nadministration, we will now turn to consider their internal organization.\r\nIt was only after long and difficult struggles that these trade\r\nassociations succeeded in taking a definite and established position;\r\nwithout, however, succeeding at any time in organizing themselves as one\r\nbody on the same basis and with the same privileges. Therefore, in\r\npointing out the influential character of these institutions generally, we\r\nmust omit various matters specially connected with individual\r\nassociations, which it would be impossible to mention in this brief\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century, the period when the communities of crafts were\r\nat the height of their development and power, no association of artisans\r\ncould legally exist without a license either from the king, the lord, the\r\nprince, the abbot, the bailiff, or the mayor of the district in which it\r\nproposed to establish itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.--Banner of the Tilers of Paris, with the\r\nArmorial Bearings of the Corporation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.--Banner of the Nail-makers of Paris, with\r\nArmorial Bearings of the Corporation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238.--Banner of the Harness-makers of Paris, with the\r\nArmorial Bearings of the Corporation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.--Banner of the Wheelwrights of Paris, with the\r\nArmoral Bearings of the Corporation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.--Banner of the Tanners of Vie, with the Patron\r\nSaint of the Corporation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.--Banner of the Weavers of Poulon, with the Patron\r\nSaint of the Corporation.]\r\n\r\nThese communities had their statutes and privileges; they were\r\ndistinguished at public ceremonials by their _liveries_ or special dress,\r\nas well as by their arms and banners (Figs. 235 to 241). They possessed\r\nthe right freely to discuss their general interests, and at meetings\r\ncomposed of all their members they might modify their statutes, provided\r\nthat such changes were confirmed by the King or by the authorities. It was\r\nalso necessary that these meetings, at which the royal delegates were\r\npresent, should be duly authorised; and, lastly, so as to render the\r\ncommunication between members more easy, and to facilitate everything\r\nwhich concerned the interests of the craft, artisans of the same trade\r\nusually resided in the same quarter of the town, and even in the same\r\nstreet. The names of many streets in Paris and other towns of France\r\ntestify to this custom, which still partially exists in the towns of\r\nGermany and Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.--Ceremonial Dress of an Elder and a Juror of the\r\nCorporation of Old Shoemakers of Ghent.]\r\n\r\nThe communities of artisans had, to a certain extent, the character and\r\nposition of private individuals. They had the power in their corporate\r\ncapacity of holding and administrating property, of defending or bringing\r\nactions at law, of accepting inheritances, &c.; they disbursed from a\r\ncommon treasury, which was supplied by legacies, donations, fines, and\r\nperiodical subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThese communities exercised in addition, through their jurors, a\r\nmagisterial authority, and even, under some circumstances, a criminal\r\njurisdiction over their members. For a long time they strove to extend\r\nthis last power or to keep it independent of municipal control and the\r\nsupreme courts, by which it was curtailed to that of exercising a simple\r\npolice authority strictly confined to persons or things relating to the\r\ncraft. They carefully watched for any infractions of the rules of the\r\ntrade. They acted as arbitrators between master and man, particularly in\r\nquarrels when the parties had had recourse to violence. The functions of\r\nthis kind of domestic magistracy were exercised by officers known under\r\nvarious names, such as _kings, masters, elders, guards, syndics_, and\r\n_jurors_, who were besides charged to visit the workshops at any hour they\r\npleased in order to see that the laws concerning the articles of\r\nworkmanship were observed. They also received the taxes for the benefit of\r\nthe association; and, lastly, they examined the apprentices and installed\r\nmasters into their office (Fig. 242).\r\n\r\nThe jurors, or syndics, as they were more usually called, and whose number\r\nvaried according to the importance of numerical force of the corporation,\r\nwere generally elected by the majority of votes of their fellow-workmen,\r\nthough sometimes the choice of these was entirely in the hands of the\r\ngreat officers of state. It was not unfrequent to find women amongst the\r\ndignitaries of the arts and crafts; and the professional tribunals, which\r\ndecided every question relative to the community and its members, were\r\noften held by an equal number of masters and associate craftsmen. The\r\njealous, exclusive, and inflexible spirit of caste, which in the Middle\r\nAges is to be seen almost everywhere, formed one of the principal features\r\nof industrial associations. The admission of new members was surrounded\r\nwith conditions calculated to restrict the number of associates and to\r\ndiscourage candidates. The sons of masters alone enjoyed hereditary\r\nprivileges, in consequence of which they were always allowed to be\r\nadmitted without being subjected to the tyrannical yoke of the\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martyrdom of SS. Crispin and Crépinien.\r\n\r\nFrom a window in the Hôpital des Quinze-Vingts (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nGenerally the members of a corporation were divided into three distinct\r\nclasses--the masters, the paid assistants or companions, and the\r\napprentices. Apprenticeship, from which the sons of masters were often\r\nexempted, began between the ages of twelve and seventeen years, and\r\nlasted from two to five years. In most of the trades the master could only\r\nreceive one apprentice in his house besides his own son. Tanners, dyers,\r\nand goldsmiths were allowed one of their relatives in addition, or a\r\nsecond apprentice if they had no relation willing to learn their trade;\r\nand although some commoner trades, such as butchers and bakers, were\r\nallowed an unlimited number of apprentices, the custom of restriction had\r\nbecome a sort of general law, with the object of limiting the number of\r\nmasters and workmen to the requirements of the public. The position of\r\npaid assistant or companion was required to be held in many trades for a\r\ncertain length of time before promotion to mastership could be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.--Bootmaker's Apprentice working at a\r\nTrial-piece.--From a Window of the Thirteenth Century, published by\r\nMessrs. Cahier and Martin]\r\n\r\nWhen apprentices or companions wished to become masters, they were called\r\n_aspirants_, and were subjected to successive examinations. They were\r\nparticularly required to prove their ability by executing what was termed\r\na _chef-d'oeuvre_, which consisted in fabricating a perfect specimen of\r\nwhatever craft they practised. The execution of the _chef-d'oeuvre_ gave\r\nrise to many technical formalities, which were at times most frivolous.\r\nThe aspirant in certain cases had to pass a technical examination, as,\r\nfor instance, the barber in forging and polishing lancets; the wool-weaver\r\nin making and adjusting the different parts of his loom; and during the\r\nperiod of executing the _chef-d'oeuvre,_ which often extended over several\r\nmonths, the aspirant was deprived of all communication with his fellows.\r\nHe had to work at the office of the association, which was called the\r\n_bureau_, under the eyes of the jurors or syndics, who, often after an\r\nangry debate, issued their judgment upon the merits of the work and the\r\ncapability of the workman (Figs. 243 and 244).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.--Carpenter's Apprentice working at a\r\nTrial-piece.--From one of the Stalls called _Miséricordes_, in Rouen\r\nCathedral (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nOn his admission the aspirant had first to take again the oath of\r\nallegiance to the King before the provost or civil deputy, although he had\r\nalready done so on commencing his apprenticeship. He then had to pay a\r\nduty or fee, which was divided between the sovereign or lord and the\r\nbrotherhood, from which fee the sons of masters always obtained a\r\nconsiderable abatement. Often, too, the husbands of the daughters of\r\nmasters were exempted from paying the duties. A few masters, such as the\r\ngoldsmiths and the cloth-workers, had besides to pay a sum of money by way\r\nof guarantee, which remained in the funds of the craft as long as they\r\ncarried on the trade. After these forms had been complied with, the\r\nmasters acquired the exclusive privilege of freely exercising their\r\nprofession. There were, however, certain exceptions to this rule, for a\r\nking on his coronation, a prince or princess of the royal blood at the\r\ntime of his or her marriage, and, in certain towns, the bishop on his\r\ninstallation, had the right of creating one or more masters in each trade,\r\nand these received their licence without going through any of the usual\r\nformalities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.--Staircase of the Office of the Goldsmiths of\r\nRouen (Fifteenth Century). The Shield which the Lion holds with his Paw\r\nshows the Arms of the Goldsmiths of Rouen. (Present Condition).]\r\n\r\nA widower or widow might generally continue the craft of the deceased wife\r\nor husband who had acquired the freedom, and which thus became the\r\ninheritance of the survivor. The condition, however, was that he or she\r\ndid not contract a second marriage with any one who did not belong to the\r\ncraft. Masters lost their rights directly they worked for any other master\r\nand received wages. Certain freedoms, too, were only available in the\r\ntowns in which they had been obtained. In more than one craft, when a\r\nfamily holding the freedom became extinct, their premises and tools became\r\nthe property of the corporation, subject to an indemnity payable to the\r\nnext of kin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.--Shops under Covered Market (Goldsmith, Dealer in\r\nStuffs, and Shoemaker).--From a Miniature in Aristotle's \"Ethics and\r\nPolitics,\" translated by Nicholas Oresme (Manuscript of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury, Library of Rouen).]\r\n\r\nAt times, and particularly in those trades where the aspirants were not\r\nrequired to produce a _chef-d'oeuvre_, the installation of masters was\r\naccompanied with extraordinary ceremonies, which no doubt originally\r\npossessed some symbolical meaning, but which, having lost their true\r\nsignification, became singular, and appeared even ludicrous. Thus with the\r\nbakers, after four years' apprenticeship, the candidate on purchasing the\r\nfreedom from the King, issued from his door, escorted by all the other\r\nbakers of the town, bearing a new pot filled with walnuts and wafers. On\r\narriving before the chief of the corporation, he said to him, \"Master, I\r\nhave accomplished my four years; here is my pot filled with walnuts and\r\nwafers.\" The assistants in the ceremony having vouched for the truth of\r\nthis statement, the candidate broke the pot against the wall, and the\r\nchief solemnly pronounced his admission, which was inaugurated by the\r\nolder masters emptying a number of tankards of wine or beer at the expense\r\nof their new brother. The ceremony was also of a jovial character in the\r\ncase of the millwrights, who only admitted the candidate after he had\r\nreceived a caning on the shoulders from the last-elected brother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.--Fac-simile of the first six Lines on the Copper\r\nTablet on which was engraved, from the year 1470, the Names and Titles of\r\nthose who were elected Members of the Corporation of Goldsmiths of Ghent.]\r\n\r\nThe statutes of the corporations, which had the force of law on account of\r\nbeing approved and accepted by royal authority, almost always detailed\r\nwith the greatest precision the conditions of labour. They fixed the hours\r\nand days for working, the size of the articles to be made, the quality of\r\nthe stuffs used in their manufacture, and even the price at which they\r\nwere to be sold (Fig. 246). Night labour was pretty generally forbidden,\r\nas likely to produce only imperfect work. We nevertheless find that\r\ncarpenters were permitted to make coffins and other funeral articles by\r\nnight. On the eve of religious feasts the shops were shut earlier than\r\nusual, that is to say, at three o'clock, and were not opened on the next\r\nday, with the exception of those of pastrycooks, whose assistance was\r\nespecially required on feast days, and who sold curious varieties of cakes\r\nand sweetmeats. Notwithstanding the strictness of the rules and the\r\nadministrative laws of each trade, which were intended to secure good\r\nfaith and loyalty between the various members, it is unnecessary to state\r\nthat they were frequently violated. The fines which were then imposed on\r\ndelinquents constituted an important source of revenue, not only to the\r\ncorporations themselves, but also to the town treasury. The penally,\r\nhowever, was not always a pecuniary one, for as late as the fifteenth\r\ncentury we have instances of artisans being condemned to death simply for\r\nhaving adulterated their articles of trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.--Elder and Jurors of the Tanners of the Town of\r\nGhent in Ceremonial Dress.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript of\r\nthe Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThis deception was looked upon as of the nature of robbery, which we know\r\nto have been for a long time punishable by death. Robbery on the part of\r\nmerchants found no indulgence nor pardon in those days, and the whole\r\ncorporation demanded immediate and exemplary justice.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statutes, which generally tended to prevent frauds and\r\nfalsifications, in most crafts the masters were bound to put their\r\ntrade-mark on their goods, or some particular sign which was to be a\r\nguarantee for the purchaser and one means of identifying the culprit in\r\nthe event of complaints arising on account of the bad quality or bad\r\nworkmanship of the articles sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.--Companion Carpenter.--Fragment of a Woodcut of\r\nthe Fifteenth Century, after a Drawing by Wohlgemüth for the \"Chronique de\r\nNuremberg.\"]\r\n\r\nBesides taking various steps to maintain professional integrity, the\r\nframers of the various statutes, as a safeguard to the public interests,\r\nundertook also to inculcate morality and good feeling amongst their\r\nmembers. A youth could not be admitted unless he could prove his\r\nlegitimacy of birth by his baptismal register; and, to obtain the freedom,\r\nhe was bound to bear an irreproachable character. Artisans exposed\r\nthemselves to a reprimand, and even to bodily chastisement, from the\r\ncorporation, for even associating with, and certainly for working or\r\ndrinking with those who had been expelled. Licentiousness and misconduct\r\nof any kind rendered them liable to be deprived of their mastership. In\r\nsome trade associations all the members were bound to solemnize the day of\r\nthe decease of a brother, to assist at his funeral, and to follow him to\r\nthe grave. In another community the slightest indecent or discourteous\r\nword was punishable by a fine. A new master could not establish himself in\r\nthe same street as his former master, except at a distance, which was\r\ndetermined by the statutes; and, further, no member was allowed to ask for\r\nor attract customers when the latter were nearer the shop of his neighbour\r\nthan of his own.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages religion placed its stamp on every occupation and\r\ncalling, and corporations were careful to maintain this characteristic\r\nfeature. Each was under the patronage of some saint, who was considered\r\nthe special protector of the craft; each possessed a shrine or chapel in\r\nsome church of the quarter where the trade was located, and some even kept\r\nchaplains at their own expense for the celebration of masses which were\r\ndaily said for the souls of the good deceased members of the craft. These\r\nassociations, animated by Christian charity, took upon them to invoke the\r\nblessings of heaven on all members of the fraternity, and to assist those\r\nwho were either laid by through sickness or want of work, and to take care\r\nof the widows and to help the orphans of the less prosperous craftsmen.\r\nThey also gave alms to the poor, and presented the broken meat left at\r\ntheir banquets to the hospitals.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of _garçons_, or _compagnons de devoir_ (this surname was\r\nat first specially applied to carpenters and masons, who from a very\r\nancient date formed an important association, which was partly secret, and\r\nfrom which Freemasonry traces its origin) (Fig. 250), the companions,\r\nnotwithstanding that they belonged to the community of their own special\r\ncraft, also formed distinct corporations among themselves with a view to\r\nmutual assistance. They made a point of visiting any foreign workman on\r\nhis arrival in their town, supplied his first requirements, found him\r\nwork, and, when work was wanting, the oldest companion gave up his place\r\nto him. These associations of companionship, however, soon failed to carry\r\nout the noble object for which they were instituted. After a time the\r\nmeeting together of the fraternity was but a pretext for intemperance and\r\ndebauchery, and at times their tumultuous processions and indecent\r\nmasquerades occasioned much disorder in the cities. The facilities which\r\nthese numerous associations possessed of extending and mutually\r\nco-operating with one another also led to coalitions among them for the\r\npurpose of securing any advantage which they desired to possess. Sometimes\r\nopen violence was resorted to to obtain their exorbitant and unjust\r\ndemands, which greatly excited the industrious classes, and eventually\r\ninduced the authorities to interfere. Lastly, these brotherhoods gave rise\r\nto many violent quarrels, which ended in blows and too often in bloodshed,\r\nbetween workmen of the same craft, who took different views on debateable\r\npoints. The decrees of parliament, the edicts of sovereigns, and the\r\ndecisions of councils, as early as at the end of the fifteenth century and\r\nthroughout the whole of the sixteenth, severely proscribed the doings of\r\nthese brotherhoods, but these interdictions were never duly and rigidly\r\nenforced, and the authorities themselves often tolerated infractions of\r\nthe law, and thus license was given to every kind of abuse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.--Carpenters.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the\r\n\"Chroniques de Hainaut,\" Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the\r\nBurgundy Library, Brussels.]\r\n\r\nWe have frequently mentioned in the course of this volume the political\r\npart played by the corporations during the Middle Ages. We know the active\r\nand important part taken by trades of all descriptions, in France in the\r\ngreat movement of the formation of communities. The spirit of fraternal\r\nassociation which constituted the strength of the corporations (Fig. 251),\r\nand which exhibited itself so conspicuously in every act of their public\r\nand private life, resisted during several centuries the individual and\r\ncollective attacks made on it by craftsmen themselves. These rich and\r\npowerful corporations began to decline from the moment they ceased to be\r\nunited, and they were dissolved by law at the beginning of the revolution\r\nof 1789, an act which necessarily dealt a heavy blow to industry and\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.--Painting commemorative of the Union of the\r\nMerchants of Rouen at the End of the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.--Banner of the Drapers of Caen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxes, Money, and Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Taxes under the Roman Rule.--Money Exactions of the Merovingian\r\n  Kings.--Varieties of Money.--Financial Laws under Charlemagne.--Missi\r\n  Dominici.--Increase of Taxes owing to the Crusades.--Organization of\r\n  Finances by Louis IX.--Extortions of Philip le Bel.--Pecuniary\r\n  Embarrassaient of his Successors.--Charles V. re-establishes Order in\r\n  Finances.--Disasters of France under Charles VI., Charles VII., and\r\n  Jacques Coeur.--Changes in Taxation from Louis XI. to Francis I.--The\r\n  great Financiers.--Florimond Robertet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we believe Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War, the Gauls were\r\ngroaning in his time under the pressure of taxation, and struggled hard to\r\nremove it. Rome lightened their burden; but the fiscal system of the\r\nmetropolis imperceptibly took root in all the Roman provinces. There was\r\nan arbitrary personal tax, called the poll tax, and a land tax which was\r\nnamed _cens_, calculated according to the area of the holding. Besides\r\nthese, there were taxes on articles of consumption, on salt, on the import\r\nand export of all articles of merchandise, on sales by auction; also on\r\nmarriages, on burials, and on houses. There were also legacy and\r\nsuccession duties, and taxes on slaves, according to their number. Tolls\r\non highways were also created; and the treasury went so far as to tax the\r\nhearth. Hence the origin of the name, _feu_, which was afterwards applied\r\nto each household or family group assembled in the same house or sitting\r\nbefore the same fire. A number of other taxes sprung up, called\r\n_sordides_, from which the nobility and the government functionaries were\r\nexempt.\r\n\r\nThis ruinous system of taxation, rendered still more insupportable by the\r\nexactions of the proconsuls, and the violence of their subordinates, went\r\non increasing down to the time of the fall of the Roman Empire. The Middle\r\nAges gave birth to a new order of things. The municipal administration,\r\ncomposed in great part of Gallo-Roman citizens, did not perceptibly\r\ndeviate from the customs established for five centuries, but each invading\r\nnation by degrees introduced new habits and ideas into the countries they\r\nsubdued. The Germans and Franks, having become masters of part of Gaul,\r\nestablished themselves on the lands which they had divided between them.\r\nThe great domains, with their revenues which had belonged to the emperors,\r\nnaturally became the property of the barbarian chiefs, and served to\r\ndefray the expenses of their houses or their courts. These chiefs, at each\r\ngeneral assembly of the _Leudes_, or great vassals, received presents of\r\nmoney, of arms, of horses, and of various objects of home or of foreign\r\nmanufacture. For a long time these gifts were voluntary. The territorial\r\nfief, which was given to those soldlers who had deserved it by their\r\nmilitary services, involved from the holders a personal service to the\r\nKing. They had to attend him on his journeys, to follow him to war, and to\r\ndefend him under all circumstances. The fief was entirely exempt from\r\ntaxes. Many misdeeds--even robberies and other crimes, which were\r\nordinarily punishable by death--were pardonable on payment of a\r\nproportionate fine, and oaths, in many cases, might be absolved in the\r\nsame way. Thus a large revenue was received, which was generally divided\r\nequally between the State, the procurator fiscal, and the King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.--The Extraction of Metals.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster, folio: Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nWar, which was almost constant in those turbulent times, furnished the\r\nbarbarian kings with occasional resources, which were usually much more\r\nimportant than the ordinary supplies from taxation. The first chiefs of\r\nthe Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, and the Franks, sought means of\r\nreplenishing their treasuries by their victorious arms. Alaric, Totila,\r\nand Clovis thus amassed enormous wealth, without troubling themselves to\r\nplace the government finances on a satisfactory basis. We see, however, a\r\nsemblance of financial organization in the institutions of Alaric and his\r\nsuccessors. Subsequently, the great Théodoric, who had studied the\r\nadministrative theories of the Byzantine Court, exercised his genius in\r\nendeavouring to work out an accurate system of finance, which was adopted\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nGregory of Tours, a writer of the sixteenth century, relates in several\r\npassages of his \"History of the Franks,\" that they exhibited the same\r\nrepugnance to compulsory taxation as the Germans of the time of Tacitus.\r\nThe _Leudes_ considered that they owed nothing to the treasury, and to\r\nforce them to submit to taxation was not an easy matter. About the year\r\n465, Childéric I., father of Clovis, lost his crown for wishing all\r\nclasses to submit to taxation equally. In 673, Childéric II., King of\r\nAustrasia, had one of these _Leudes_, named Bodillon, flogged with rods\r\nfor daring to reproach him with the injustice of certain taxes. He,\r\nhowever, was afterwards assassinated by this same Bodillon, and the\r\n_Leudes_ maintained their right of immunity. A century before the _Leudes_\r\nwere already quarrelling with royalty on account of the taxes, which they\r\nrefused to pay, and they sacrificed Queen Brunehaut because she attempted\r\nto enrich the treasury with the confiscated property of a few nobles who\r\nhad rebelled against her authority. The wealth of the Frank kings, which\r\nwas always very great, was a continual object of envy, and on one occasion\r\nChilpéric I., King of Soissons, having the _Leudes_ in league with him,\r\nlaid his hands on the wealth amassed by his father, Clotaire I., which was\r\nkept in the Palace of Braine. He was, nevertheless, obliged to share his\r\nspoil with his brothers and their followers, who came in arms to force him\r\nto refund what he had taken. Chilpéric (Fig. 254) was so much in awe of\r\nthese _Leudes_ that he did not ask them for money. His wife, the\r\nmuch-feared Frédégonde, did not, however, exempt them more than Brunehaut\r\nhad done; and her judges or ministers, Audon and Mummius, having met with\r\nan insurmountable resistance in endeavouring to force taxation on the\r\nnobles, nearly lost their lives in consequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.--Tomb of Chilpéric.--Sculpture of the Eleventh\r\nCentury, in the Abbey of St. Denis.]\r\n\r\nThe custom of numbering the population, such as was carried on in Rome\r\nthrough the censors, appears to have been observed under the Merovingian\r\nkings. At the request of the Bishop of Poitiers, Childebert gave orders to\r\namend the census taken under Sigebert, King of Austrasia. It is a most\r\ncurious document mentioned by Gregory of Tours. \"The ancient division,\" he\r\nsays, \"had been one so unequal, owing to the subdivision of properties and\r\nother changes which time had made in the condition of the taxpayers, that\r\nthe poor, the orphans, and the helpless classes generally alone bore the\r\nreal burden of taxation.\" Florentius, comptroller of the King's household,\r\nand Romulfus, count of the palace, remedied this abuse. After a closer\r\nexamination of the changes which had taken place, they relieved the\r\ntaxpayers who were too heavily rated and placed the burden on those who\r\ncould better afford it.\r\n\r\nThis direct taxation continued on this plan until the time of the kings of\r\nthe second dynasty. The Franks, who had not the privilege of exemption,\r\npaid a poll tax and a house tax; about a tenth was charged on the produce\r\nof highly cultivated lands, a little more on that of lands of an inferior\r\ndescription, and a certain measure, a _cruche_, of wine on the produce of\r\nevery half acre of vineyard. There were assessors and royal agents charged\r\nwith levying such taxes and regulating the farming of them. In spite of\r\nthis precaution, however, an edict of Clovis II., in the year 615,\r\ncensures the mode of imposing rates and taxes; it orders that they shall\r\nonly be levied in the places where they have been authorised, and forbade\r\ntheir being used under any pretext whatever for any other object than that\r\nfor which they were imposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.--Signature of St. Eloy (Eligius), Financier and\r\nMinister to Dagobert I.; from the Charter of Foundation of the Abbey of\r\nSolignac (Mabillon, \"Da Re Diplomatica\").]\r\n\r\nUnder the Merovingians specie was not in common use, although the precious\r\nmetals were abundant among the Gauls, as their mines of gold and silver\r\nwere not yet exhausted. Money was rarely coined, except on great\r\noccasions, such as a coronation, the birth of an heir to the throne, the\r\nmarriage of a prince, or the commemoration of a decisive victory. It is\r\neven probable that each time that money was used in large sums the pound\r\nor the _sou_ of gold was represented more by ingots of metal than by\r\nstamped coin. The third of the _sou_ of gold, which was coined on state\r\noccasions, seems to have been used only as a commemorative medal, to be\r\ndistributed amongst the great officers of state, and this circumstance\r\nexplains their extreme rarity. The general character of the coinage,\r\nwhether of gold, silver, or of the baser metals, of the Burgundian,\r\nAustrasian, and Frank kings, differs little from what it had been at the\r\ntime of the last of the Roman emperors, though the _Angel bearing the\r\ncross_ gradually replaced the _Renommée victorieuse_ formerly stamped on\r\nthe coins. Christian monograms and symbols of the Trinity were often\r\nintermingled with the initials of the sovereign. It also became common to\r\ncombine in a monogram letters thought to be sacred or lucky, such as C, M,\r\nS, T, &c.; also to introduce the names of places, which, perhaps, have\r\nsince disappeared, as well as some particular mark or sign special to each\r\nmint. Some of these are very difficult to understand, and present a number\r\nof problems which have yet to be solved (Figs. 256 to 259). Unfortunately,\r\nthe names of places on Merovingian coins to the number of about nine\r\nhundred, have rarely been studied by coin collectors, expert both as\r\ngeographers and linguists. We find, for example, one hundred distinct\r\nmints, and, up to the present time, have not been able to determine where\r\nthe greater number of them were situated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Merovingian Gold Coins, Struck by St. Eloy, Moneyer to\r\nDagobert I.

Cross with\r\nanchor; under the arms of the cross, Eligi. ]\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Clovis became a Christian, he loaded the Church with\r\nfavours, and it soon possessed considerable revenues, and enjoyed many\r\nvaluable immunities. The sons of Clovis contested these privileges; but\r\nthe Church resisted for a time, though she was eventually obliged to give\r\nway to the iron hand of Charles Martel. In 732 this great military\r\nchieftain, after his struggle with Rainfroy, and after his brilliant\r\nvictories over the Saxons, the Bavarians, the Swiss, and the Saracens,\r\nstripped the clergy of their landed possessions, in order to distribute\r\nthem amongst his _Leudes_, who by this means he secured as his creatures,\r\nand who were, therefore, ever willing and eager to serve him in arms.\r\n\r\nOn ascending the throne, King Pepin, who wanted to pacify the Church,\r\nendeavoured as far as possible to obliterate the recollection of the\r\nwrongs of which his father had been guilty towards her; he ordered the\r\n_dîmes_ and the _nones_ (tenth and ninth denier levied on the value of\r\nlands) to be placed to the account of the possessors of each\r\necclesiastical domain, on their under-taking to repair the buildings\r\n(churches, châteaux, abbeys, and presbyteries), and to restore to the\r\nowners the properties on which they held mortgages. The nobles long\r\nresented this, and it required the authority and the example of\r\nCharlemagne to soothe the contending parties, and to make Church and State\r\nact in harmony.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne renounced the arbitrary rights established by the Mayors of\r\nthe Palace, and retained only those which long usage had legitimatised. He\r\nregistered them clearly in a code called the _Capitulaires_, into which he\r\nintroduced the ancient laws of the Ripuaires, the Burgundians, and the\r\nFranks, arranging them so as to suit the organization and requirements of\r\nhis vast empire. From that time each freeman subscribed to the military\r\nservice according to the amount of his possessions. The great vassal, or\r\nfiscal judge, was no longer allowed to practise extortion on those\r\ncitizens appointed to defend the State. Freemen could legally refuse all\r\nservile or obligatory work imposed on them by the nobles, and the amount\r\nof labour to be performed by the serfs was lessened. Without absolutely\r\nabolishing the authority of local customs in matters of finance, or\r\npenalties which had been illegally exacted, they were suspended by laws\r\ndecided at the _Champs de Mai_, by the Counts and by the _Leudes_, in\r\npresence of the Emperor. Arbitrary taxes were abolished, as they were no\r\nlonger required. Food, and any articles of consumption, and military\r\nmunitions, were exempted from taxation; and the revenues derived from\r\ntolls on road gates, on bridges, and on city gates, &c., were applied to\r\nthe purposes for which they were imposed, namely, to the repair of the\r\nroads, the bridges, and the fortified enclosures. The _heriban_, a fine of\r\nsixty sols--which in those days would amount to more than 6,000\r\nfrancs--was imposed on any holder of a fief who refused military service,\r\nand each noble was obliged to pay this for every one of his vassals who\r\nwas absent when summoned to the King's banner. These fines must have\r\nproduced considerable sums. A special law exempted ecclesiastics from\r\nbearing arms, and Charlemagne decreed that their possessions should be\r\nsacred and untouched, and everything was done to ensure the payment of the\r\nindemnity--_dîme_ and _none_--which was due to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260.--Toll on Markets levied by a Cleric.--From one of\r\nthe Painted Windows of the Cathedral of Tournay (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nCharlemagne also superintended the coining and circulation of money. He\r\ndirected that the silver sou should exactly contain the twenty-second part\r\nby weight of the pound. He also directed that money should only be coined\r\nin the Imperial palaces. He forbade the circulation of spurious coin; he\r\nordered base coiners to be severely punished, and imposed heavy fines upon\r\nthose who refused to accept the coin in legal circulation. The tithe due\r\nto the Church (Fig. 260), which was imposed at the National Assembly in\r\n779, and disbursed by the diocesan bishops, gave rise to many complaints\r\nand much opposition. This tithe was in addition to that paid to the King,\r\nwhich was of itself sufficiently heavy. The right of claiming the two\r\ntithes, however, had a common origin, so that the sovereign defended his\r\nown rights in protecting those of the Church. This is set forth in the\r\ntext of the _Capitulaires_, from the year 794 to 829. \"What had originally\r\nbeen only a voluntary and pious offering of a few of the faithful,\" says\r\nthe author of the \"Histoire Financière de la France,\" \"became thus a\r\nperpetual tax upon agriculture, custom rather than law enforcing its\r\npayment; and a tithe which was at first limited to the produce of the\r\nsoil, soon extended itself to cattle and other live stock.\"\r\n\r\nRoyal delegates (_missi dominici_), who were invested with complex\r\nfunctions, and with very extensive power, travelled through the empire\r\nexercising legal jurisdiction over all matters of importance. They\r\nassembled all the _placites_, or provincial authorities, and inquired\r\nparticularly into the collection of the public revenue. During their\r\ntours, which took place four times a year, they either personally annulled\r\nunjust sentences, or submitted them to the Emperor. They denounced any\r\nirregularities on the part of the Counts, punished the negligences of\r\ntheir assessors, and often, in order to replace unworthy judges, they had\r\nto resort to a system of election of assessors, chosen from among the\r\npeople. They verified the returns for the census; superintended the\r\nkeeping up of the royal domains; corrected frauds in matters of taxation;\r\nand punished usurers as much as base coiners, for at that time money was\r\nnot considered a commercial article, nor was it thought right that a\r\nmoney-lender should be allowed to carry on a trade which required a\r\nremuneration proportionate to the risk which he incurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261.--Sale by Town-Crier. _Preco_, the Crier, blowing\r\na trumpet; _Subhastator_, public officer charged with the sale. In the\r\nbackground is seen another sale, by the Bellman.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut\r\nin the Work of Josse Damhoudere, \"Praxis Rerum Civilium,\" 4to: Antwerp,\r\n1557.]\r\n\r\nThese _missi dominici_ were too much hated by the great vassals to outlive\r\nthe introduction of the feudal system. Their royal masters, as they\r\nthemselves gradually lost a part of their own privileges and power, could\r\nnot sustain the authority of these officers. Dukes, counts, and barons,\r\nhaving become magistrates, arbitrarily levied new taxes, imposed new\r\nfines, and appropriated the King's tributes to such an extent that,\r\ntowards the end of the tenth century, the laws of Charlemagne had no\r\nlonger any weight. We then find a number of new taxes levied for the\r\nbenefit of the nobles, the very names of which have fallen into disuse\r\nwith the feudal claims which they represented. Among these new taxes were\r\nthose of _escorte_ and _entrée_, of _mortmain_, of _lods et ventes_, of\r\n_relief_, the _champarts_, the _taille_, the _fouage_, and the various\r\nfees for wine-pressing, grinding, baking, &c., all of which were payable\r\nwithout prejudice to the tithes due to the King and the Church. However,\r\nas the royal tithe was hardly ever paid, the kings were obliged to look to\r\nother means for replenishing their treasuries; and coining false money was\r\na common practice. Unfortunately each great vassal vied with the kings in\r\nthis, and to such an extent, that the enormous quantity of bad money\r\ncoined during the ninth century completed the public ruin, and made this a\r\nsad period of social chaos. The freeman was no longer distinguishable from\r\nthe villain, nor the villain from the serf. Serfdom was general; men found\r\nthemselves, as it were, slaves, in possession of land which they laboured\r\nat with the sweat of their brow, only to cultivate for the benefit of\r\nothers. The towns even--with the exception of a few privileged cities, as\r\nFlorence, Paris, Lyons, Rheims, Metz, Strasburg, Marseilles, Hamburg,\r\nFrankfort, and Milan--were under the dominion of some ecclesiastical or\r\nlay lord, and only enjoyed liberty of a more or less limited character.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eleventh century, under Philip I., the enthusiasm\r\nfor Crusades became general, and, as all the nobles joined in the holy\r\nmission of freeing the tomb of Jesus Christ from the hands of the\r\ninfidels, large sums of money were required to defray the costs. New taxes\r\nwere accordingly imposed; but, as these did not produce enough at once,\r\nlarge sums were raised by the sale of some of the feudal rights. Certain\r\nfranchises were in this way sold by the nobles to the boroughs, towns, and\r\nabbeys, though, in not a few instances, these very privileges had been\r\nformerly plundered from the places to which they were now sold. Fines were\r\nexacted from any person declining to go to Palestine; and foreign\r\nmerchants--especially the Jews--were required to subscribe large sums. A\r\nnumber of the nobles holding fiefs were reduced to the lowest expedients\r\nwith a view to raising money, and even sold their estates at a low price,\r\nor mortgaged them to the very Jews whom they taxed so heavily. Every town\r\nin which the spirit of Gallo-Roman municipality was preserved took\r\nadvantage of these circumstances to extend its liberties. Each monarch,\r\ntoo, found this a favourable opportunity to add new fiefs to the crown,\r\nand to recall as many great vassals as possible under his dominion. It\r\nwas at this period that communities arose, and that the first charters of\r\nfreedom which were obligatory and binding contracts between the King and\r\nthe people, date their origin. Besides the annual fines due to the King\r\nand the feudal lords, and in addition to the general subsidies, such as\r\nthe quit-rent and the tithes, these communities had to provide for the\r\nrepair of the walls or ramparts, for the paving of the streets, the\r\ncleaning of the pits, the watch on the city gates, and the various\r\nexpenses of local administration.\r\n\r\nLouis le Gros endeavoured to make a re-arrangement of the taxes, and to\r\nestablish them on a definite basis. By his orders a new register of the\r\nlands throughout the kingdom was commenced, but various calamities caused\r\nthis useful measure to be suspended. In 1149, Louis le Jeune, in\r\nconsequence of a disaster which had befallen the Crusaders, did what none\r\nof his predecessors had dared to attempt: he exacted from all his subjects\r\na sol per pound on their income. This tax, which amounted to a twentieth\r\npart of income, was paid even by the Church, which, for example's sake,\r\ndid not take advantage of its immunities. Forty years later, at a council,\r\nor _great parliament_, called by Philip Augustus, a new crusade was\r\ndecided upon; and, under the name of Saladin's tithe, an annual tax was\r\nimposed on all property, whether landed or personal, of all who did not\r\ntake up the cross to go to the Holy Land. The nobility, however, so\r\nviolently resisted this, that the King was obliged to substitute for it a\r\ngeneral tax, which, although it was still more productive, was less\r\noffensive in its mode of collection.\r\n\r\nOn returning to France in 1191, Philip Augustus rated and taxed every\r\none--nobility, bourgeois, and clergy--in order to prosecute the great wars\r\nin which he was engaged, and to provide for the first paid troops ever\r\nknown in France. He began by confirming the enormous confiscations of the\r\nproperties of the Jews, who had been banished from the kingdom, and\r\nafterwards sold a temporary permission to some of the richest of them to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe Jews at that time were the only possessors of available funds, as they\r\nwere the only people who trafficked, and who lent money on interest. On\r\nthis account the Government were glad to recall them, so as to have at\r\nhand a valuable resource which it could always make use of. As the King\r\ncould not on his own authority levy taxes upon the vassals of feudal\r\nlords, on emergencies he convoked the barons, who discussed financial\r\nmatters with the King, and, when the sum required was settled, an order\r\nof assessment was issued, and the barons undertook the collection of the\r\ntaxes. The assessment was always fixed higher than was required for the\r\nKing's wants, and the barons, having paid the King what was due to him,\r\nretained the surplus, which they divided amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a public revenue, raised by the contributions of all\r\nclasses of society, with a definite sum to be kept in reserve, thus dates\r\nfrom the reign of Philip Augustus. The annual income of the State at that\r\ntime amounted to 36,000 marks, or 72,000 pounds' weight of silver--about\r\nsixteen or seventeen million francs of present currency. The treasury,\r\nwhich was kept in the great tower of the temple (Fig. 262), was under the\r\ncustody of seven bourgeois of Paris, and a king's clerk kept a register of\r\nreceipts and disbursements. This treasury must have been well filled at\r\nthe death of Philip Augustus, for that monarch's legacies were very\r\nconsiderable. One of his last wishes deserves to be mentioned: and this\r\nwas a formal order, which he gave to Louis VIII., to employ a certain sum,\r\nleft him for that purpose, solely and entirely for the defence of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.--The Tower of the Temple, in Paris.--From an\r\nEngraving of the Topography of Paris, in the Cabinet des Estampes, of the\r\nNational Library.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gold Coins of the Sixth and Seventh Centuries.\r\n\r\nFig. 263.--Mérovée, Son of Chilperic I.\r\n\r\nFig. 264.--Dagobert I.\r\n\r\nFig. 265.--Clotaire III.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silver Coins from the Eighth to the Eleventh Centures.\r\n\r\nFig 266.--Pepin the Short.\r\n\r\nFig. 267.--Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nFig. 268.--Henri I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gold and Silver Coins of the Thirteenth Century.\r\n\r\nFig. 269.--Gold Florin of Louis IX.\r\n\r\nFig. 270.--Silver Gros of Tours.--Philip III.]\r\n\r\nWhen Louis IX., in 1242, at Taillebourg and at Saintes, had defeated the\r\ngreat vassals who had rebelled against him, he hastened to regulate the\r\ntaxes by means of a special code which bore the name of the\r\n_Établissements_. The taxes thus imposed fell upon the whole population,\r\nand even lands belonging to the Church, houses which the nobles did not\r\nthemselves occupy, rural properties and leased holdings, were all\r\nsubjected to them. There were, however, two different kinds of rates, one\r\ncalled the _occupation_ rate, and the other the rate of _exploitation_;\r\nand they were both collected according to a register, kept in the most\r\nregular and systematic manner possible. Ancient custom had maintained a\r\ntax exceptionally in the following cases: when a noble dubbed his son a\r\nknight, or gave his daughter in marriage, when he had to pay a ransom,\r\nand when he set out on a campaign against the enemies of the Church, or\r\nfor the defence of the country. These taxes were called _l'aide aux quatre\r\ncas_. At this period despotism too often overruled custom, and the good\r\nKing Louis IX., by granting legal power to custom, tried to bring it back\r\nto the true principles of justice and humanity. He was, however, none the\r\nless jealous of his own personal privileges, especially as regarded\r\ncoining (Figs. 263 to 270). He insisted that coining should be exclusively\r\ncarried on in his palace, as in the times of the Carlovingian kings, and\r\nhe required every coin to be made of a definite standard of weight, which\r\nhe himself fixed. In this way he secured the exclusive control over the\r\nmint. For the various localities, towns, or counties directly under the\r\ncrown, Louis IX. settled the mode of levying taxes. Men of integrity were\r\nelected by the vote of the General Assembly, consisting of the three\r\norders--namely, of the nobility, the clergy, and the _tiers état_--to\r\nassess the taxation of each individual; and these assessors themselves\r\nwere taxed by four of their own number. The custom of levying proprietary\r\nsubsidies in each small feudal jurisdiction could not be abolished,\r\nnotwithstanding the King's desire to do so, owing to the power still held\r\nby the nobles. Nobles were forbidden to levy a rate under any\r\nconsideration, without previously holding a meeting of the vassals and\r\ntheir tenants. The tolls on roads, bridges (Fig. 271), fairs, and markets,\r\nand the harbour dues were kept up, notwithstanding their obstruction to\r\ncommerce, with the exception that free passage was given to corn passing\r\nfrom one province to another. The exemptions from taxes which had been\r\ndearly bought were removed; and the nobles were bound not to divert the\r\nrevenue received from tolls for any purposes other than those for which\r\nthey were legitimately intended. The nobles were also required to guard\r\nthe roads \"from sunrise to sunset,\" and they were made responsible for\r\nrobberies committed upon travellers within their domains.\r\n\r\nLouis IX., by refunding the value of goods which had been stolen through\r\nthe carelessness of his officers, himself showed an example of the respect\r\ndue to the law. Those charged with collecting the King's dues, as well as\r\nthe mayors whose duty it was to take custody of the money contributed, and\r\nto receive the taxes on various articles of consumption, worked under the\r\neye of officials appointed by the King, who exercised a financial\r\njurisdiction which developed later into the department or office called\r\nthe Chamber of Accounts. A tax, somewhat similar to the tithe on funds,\r\nwas imposed for the benefit of the nobles on property held by corporations\r\nor under charter, in order to compensate the treasury for the loss of the\r\nsuccession duties. This tax represented about the fifth part of the value\r\nof the estate. To cover the enormous expenses of the two crusades, Louis\r\nIX., however, was obliged to levy two new taxes, called _decimes_, from\r\nhis already overburdened people. It does not, however, appear that this\r\nexcessive taxation alienated the affection of his subjects. Their minds\r\nwere entirely taken up with the pilgrimages to the East, and the pious\r\nmonarch, notwithstanding his fruitless sacrifices and his disastrous\r\nexpeditions, earned for himself the title of _Prince of Peace and of\r\nJustice_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.--Paying Toll on passing a Bridge.--From a Painted\r\nWindow in the Cathedral of Tournay (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Louis IX. down to that of Philippe le Bel, who was the\r\nmost extravagant of kings, and at the same time the most ingenious in\r\nraising funds for the State treasury, the financial movement of Europe\r\ntook root, and eventually became centralised in Italy. In Florence was\r\npresented an example of the concentration of the most complete municipal\r\nprivileges which a great flourishing city could desire. Pisa, Genoa, and\r\nVenice attracted a part of the European commerce towards the Adriatic and\r\nthe Mediterranean. Everywhere the Jews and Lombards--already well\r\ninitiated into the mysterious System of credit, and accustomed to lend\r\nmoney--started banks and pawn establishments, where jewels, diamonds,\r\nglittering arms, and paraphernalia of all kinds were deposited by princes\r\nand nobles as security for loans (Fig. 272).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.--View of the ancient Pont aux Changeurs.--From an\r\nEngraving of the Topography of Paris, in the Cabinet des Estampes, of the\r\nNational Library.]\r\n\r\nThe tax collectors (_maltôtiers_, a name derived from the Italian _mala\r\ntolta_, unjust tax), receivers, or farmers of taxes, paid dearly for\r\nexercising their calling, which was always a dishonourable one, and was at\r\ntimes exercised with a great amount of harshness and even of cruelty. The\r\ntreasury required a certain number of _deniers, oboles_, or _pittes_ (a\r\nsmall coin varying in value in each province) to be paid by these men for\r\neach bank operation they effected, and for every pound in value of\r\nmerchandise they sold, for they and the Jews were permitted to carry on\r\ntrades of all kinds without being subject to any kind of rates, taxes,\r\nwork, military service, or municipal dues.\r\n\r\nPhilippe le Bel, owing to his interminable wars against the King of\r\nCastille, and against England, Germany, and Flanders, was frequently so\r\nembarrassed as to be obliged to resort to extraordinary subsidies in order\r\nto carry them on. In 1295, he called upon his subjects for a forced loan,\r\nand soon after he shamelessly required them to pay the one-hundredth part\r\nof their incomes, and after but a short interval he demanded another\r\nfiftieth part. The king assumed the exclusive right to debase the value of\r\nthe coinage, which caused him to be commonly called the _base coiner_, and\r\nno sovereign ever coined a greater quantity of base money. He changed the\r\nstandard or name of current coin with a view to counterbalance the\r\nmischief arising from the illicit coinage of the nobles, and especially to\r\nbaffle the base traffic of the Jews and Lombards, who occasionally would\r\nobtain possession of a great part of the coin, and mutilate each piece\r\nbefore restoring it to circulation; in this way they upset the whole\r\nmonetary economy of the realm, and secured immense profits to themselves\r\n(Figs. 273 to 278).\r\n\r\nIn 1303, the _aide au leur_, which was afterwards called the _aide de\r\nl'ost,_ or the army tax, was invented by Philippe le Bel for raising an\r\narmy without opening his purse. It was levied without distinction upon\r\ndukes, counts, barons, ladies, damsels, archbishops, bishops, abbots,\r\nchapters, colleges, and, in fact, upon all classes, whether noble or not.\r\nNobles were bound to furnish one knight mounted, equipped, and in full\r\narmour, for every five hundred marks of land which they possessed; those\r\nwho were not nobles had to furnish six foot-soldiers for every hundred\r\nhouseholds. By another enactment of this king the privilege was granted of\r\npaying money instead of complying with these demands for men, and a sum of\r\n100 livres--about 10,000 francs of present currency--was exacted for each\r\narmed knight; and two sols--about ten francs per diem--for each soldier\r\nwhich any one failed to furnish. An outcry was raised throughout France at\r\nthis proceeding, and rebellions broke out in several provinces: in Paris\r\nthe mob destroyed the house of Stephen Barbette, master of the mint, and\r\ninsulted the King in his palace. It was necessary to enforce the royal\r\nauthority with vigour, and, after considerable difficulty, peace was at\r\nlast restored, and Philip learned, though too late, that in matters of\r\ntaxation the people should first be consulted. In 1313, for the first\r\ntime, the bourgeoisie, syndics, or deputies of communities, under the name\r\nof _tiers état_--third order of the state--were called to exercise the\r\nright of freely voting the assistance or subsidy which it pleased the King\r\nto ask of them. After this memorable occasion an edict was issued ordering\r\na levy of six deniers in the pound on every sort of merchandise sold in\r\nthe kingdom. Paris paid this without hesitation, whereas in the provinces\r\nthere was much discontented murmuring. But the following year, the King\r\nhaving tried to raise the six deniers voted by the assembly of 1313 to\r\ntwelve, the clergy, nobility, and _tiers état_ combined to resist the\r\nextortions of the government. Philippe le Bel died, after having yielded\r\nto the opposition of his indignant subjects, and in his last moments he\r\nrecommended his son to exercise moderation in taxing and honesty in\r\ncoining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gold Coins of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries.\r\n\r\nFig. 273.--Masse d'Or.

Philip VI.\r\n\r\nFig. 278.--Salut d'Or. Charles VI.]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Louis X., in 1315, war against the Flemish was\r\nimminent, although the royal treasury was absolutely empty. The King\r\nunfortunately, in spite of his father's advice, attempted systematically\r\nto tamper with the coinage, and he also commenced the exaction of fresh\r\ntaxes, to the great exasperation of his subjects. He was obliged, through\r\nfear of a general rebellion, to do away with the tithe established for the\r\nsupport of the army, and to sacrifice the superintendent of finances,\r\nEnguerrand de Marigny, to the public indignation which was felt against\r\nhim. This man, without being allowed to defend himself, was tried by an\r\nextraordinary commission of parliament for embezzling the public money,\r\nwas condemned to death, and was hung on the gibbet of Montfauçon. Not\r\ndaring to risk a convocation of the States-General of the kingdom, Louis\r\nX. ordered the seneschals to convoke the provincial assemblies, and thus\r\nobtained a few subsidies, which he promised to refund out of the revenues\r\nof his domains. The clergy even allowed themselves to be taxed, and closed\r\ntheir eyes to the misappropriation of the funds, which were supposed to be\r\nheld in reserve for a new crusade. Taxes giving commercial franchise and\r\nof exchange were levied, which were paid by the Jews, Lombards, Tuscans,\r\nand other Italians; judiciary offices were sold by auction; the trading\r\nclass purchased letters of nobility, as they had already done under\r\nPhilippe le Bel; and, more than this, the enfranchisement of serfs, which\r\nhad commenced in 1298, was continued on the payment of a tax, which varied\r\naccording to the means of each individual. In consequence of this system,\r\npersonal servitude was almost entirely abolished under Philippe de Long,\r\nbrother of Louis X.\r\n\r\nEach province, under the reign of this rapacious and necessitous monarch,\r\ndemanded some concession from the crown, and almost always obtained it at\r\na money value. Normandy and Burgundy, which were dreaded more than any\r\nother province on account of their turbulence, received remarkable\r\nconcessions. The base coin was withdrawn from circulation, and Louis X.\r\nattempted to forbid the right of coinage to those who broke the wise laws\r\nof St. Louis. The idea of bills of exchange arose at this period.\r\n\r\nThanks to the peace concluded with Flanders, on which occasion that\r\ncountry paid into the hands of the sovereign thirty thousand florins in\r\ngold for arrears of taxes, and, above all, owing to the rules of economy\r\nand order, from which Philip V., surnamed the Long, never deviated, the\r\nattitude of France became completely altered. We find the King initiating\r\nreform by reducing the expenses of his household. He convened round his\r\nperson a great council, which met monthly to examine and discuss matters\r\nof public interest; he allowed only one national treasury for the\r\nreception of the State revenues; he required the treasurers to make a\r\nhalf-yearly statement of their accounts, and a daily journal of receipts\r\nand disbursements; he forbad clerks of the treasury to make entries either\r\nof receipts or expenditure, however trifling, without the authority and\r\nsupervision of accountants, whom he also compelled to assist at the\r\nchecking of sums received or paid by the money-changers (Fig. 279). The\r\nfarming of the crown lands, the King's taxes, the stamp registration, and\r\nthe gaol duties were sold by auction, subject to certain regulations with\r\nregard to guarantee. The bailiffs and seneschals sent in their accounts to\r\nParis annually, they were not allowed to absent themselves without the\r\nKing's permission, and they were formally forbidden, under pain of\r\nconfiscation, or even a severer penalty, to speculate with the public\r\nmoney. The operations of the treasury were at this period always involved\r\nin the greatest mystery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.--Hotel of the Chamber of Accounts in the\r\nCourtyard of the Palace in Paris. From a Woodcut of the \"Cosmographie\r\nUniverselle\" of Munster, in folio: Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.--Measuring Salt.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut of the\r\n\"Ordonnances de la Prevosté des Marchands de Paris,\" in folio: 1500.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.--Toll under the Bridges of Paris.--Fac-simile of\r\na Woodcut of the \"Ordonnances de la Prevosté des Marchands de Paris,\" in\r\nfolio: 1500.]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a central mint for the whole kingdom, the expulsion\r\nof the money-dealers, who were mostly of Italian origin, and the\r\nconfiscation of their goods if it was discovered that they had acted\r\nfalsely, signalised the accession of Charles le Bel in 1332. This\r\nbeginning was welcomed as most auspicious, but before long the export\r\nduties, especially on grain, wine, hay, cattle, leather, and salt, became\r\na source of legitimate complaint (Figs. 280 and 281).\r\n\r\nPhilip VI., surnamed _de Valois_, a more astute politician than his\r\npredecessor, felt the necessity of gaining the affections of the people by\r\nsparing their private fortunes. In order to establish the public revenue\r\non a firm basis, he assembled, in 1330, the States-General, composed of\r\nbarons, prelates, and deputies from the principal towns, and then, hoping\r\nto awe the financial agents, he authorised the arrest of the overseer,\r\nPierre de Montigny, whose property was confiscated and sold, producing to\r\nthe treasury the enormous sum of 1,200,000 livres, or upwards of\r\n100,000,000 francs of present currency. The long and terrible war which\r\nthe King was forced to carry on against the English, and which ended in\r\nthe treaty of Bretigny in 1361, gave rise to the introduction of taxation\r\nof extreme severity. The dues on ecclesiastical properties were renewed\r\nand maintained for several years; all beverages sold in towns were taxed,\r\nand from four to six deniers in the pound were levied upon the value of\r\nall merchandise sold in any part of the kingdom. The salt tax, which\r\nPhilippe le Bel had established, and which his successor, Louis X.,\r\nimmediately abolished at the unanimous wish of the people, was again\r\nlevied by Philip VI., and this king, having caused the salt produced in\r\nhis domains to be sold, \"gave great offence to all classes of the\r\ncommunity.\" It was on account of this that Edward III., King of England,\r\nfacetiously called him the author of the _Salic_ law. Philippe de Valois,\r\nwhen he first ascended the throne, coined his money according to the\r\nstandard weight of St. Louis, but in a short time he more or less alloyed\r\nit. This he did secretly, in order to be able to withdraw the pieces of\r\nfull weight from circulation and to replace them with others having less\r\npure metal in them, and whose weight was made up by an extra amount of\r\nalloy. In this dishonest way a considerable sum was added to the coffers\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\nKing John, on succeeding his father in 1350, found the treasury empty and\r\nthe resources of the kingdom exhausted. He was nevertheless obliged to\r\nprovide means to continue the war against the English, who continually\r\nharassed the French on their own territory. The tax on merchandise not\r\nbeing sufficient for this war, the payment of public debts contracted by\r\nthe government was suspended, and the State was thus obliged to admit its\r\ninsolvency. The mint taxes, called _seigneuriage_, were pushed to the\r\nutmost limits, and the King levied them on the new coin, which he\r\nincreased at will by largely alloying the gold with base metals. The\r\nduties on exported and imported goods were increased, notwithstanding the\r\ncomplaints that commerce was declining. These financial expedients would\r\nnot have been tolerated by the people had not the King taken the\r\nprécaution to have them approved by the States-General of the provincial\r\nstates, which he annually assembled. In 1355 the States-General were\r\nconvoked, and the King, who had to maintain thirty thousand soldiers,\r\nasked them to provide for this annual expenditure, estimated at 5,000,000\r\n_livres parisis_, about 300,000,000 francs of present currency. The\r\nStates-General, animated by a generous feeling of patriotism, \"ordered a\r\ntax of eight deniers in the pound on the sale and transfer of all goods\r\nand articles of merchandise, with the exception of inheritances, which was\r\nto be payable by the vendors, of whatever rank they might be, whether\r\necclesiastics, nobles, or others, and also a salt tax to be levied\r\nthroughout the whole kingdom of France.\" The King promised as long as this\r\nassistance lasted to levy no other subsidy and to coin good and sterling\r\nmoney--i.e., _deniers_ of fine gold, _white_, or silver coin, coin of\r\n_billon_, or mixed metal, and _deniers_ and _mailles_ of copper. The\r\nassembly appointed travelling agents and three inspectors or\r\nsuperintendents, who had under them two receivers and a considerable\r\nnumber of sub-collectors, whose duties were defined with scrupulous\r\nminuteness. The King at this time renounced the right of seizin, his dues\r\nover property, inherited or conveyed by sale, exchange, gift, or will, his\r\nright of demanding war levies by proclamation, and of issuing forced\r\nloans, the despotic character of which offended everybody. The following\r\nyear, the tax of eight deniers having been found insufficient and\r\nexpensive in its collection, the assembly substituted for it a property\r\nand income tax, varying according to the property and income of each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.--The Courtiers amassing Riches at the Expense of\r\nthe Poor.--From a Miniature in the 'Tresor of Brunetto Latini, Manuscript\r\nof the Fourteenth Century, in the Library of the Arsenal, Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe finances were, notwithstanding these additions, in a low and\r\nunsatisfactory condition, which became worse and worse from the fatal day\r\nof Poitiers, when King John fell into the hands of the English. The\r\nStates-General were summoned by the Dauphin, and, seeing the desperate\r\ncondition in which the country was placed, all classes freely opened their\r\npurses. The nobility, who had already given their blood, gave the produce\r\nof all their feudal dues besides. The church paid a tenth and a half, and\r\nthe bourgeois showed the most noble unselfishness, and rose as one man to\r\nfind means to resist the common enemy. The ransom of the King had been\r\nfixed at three millions of _écus d'or,_ nearly a thousand million francs,\r\npayable in six years, and the peace of Bretigny was concluded by the\r\ncession of a third of the territory of France. There was, however, cause\r\nfor congratulation in this result, for \"France was reduced to its utmost\r\nextremity,\" says a chronicler, \"and had not something led to a reaction,\r\nshe must have perished irretrievably.\"\r\n\r\nKing John, grateful for the love and devotion shown to him by his subjects\r\nunder these trying circumstances, returned from captivity with the solemn\r\nintention of lightening the burdens which pressed upon them, and in\r\nconsequence be began by spontaneously reducing the enormous wages which\r\nthe tax-gatherers had hitherto received, and by abolishing the tolls on\r\nhighways. He also sold to the Jews, at a very high price, the right of\r\nremaining in the kingdom and of exercising any trade in it, and by this\r\nmeans he obtained a large sum of money. He solemnly promised never again\r\nto debase the coin, and he endeavoured to make an equitable division of\r\nthe taxes. Unfortunately it was impossible to do without a public revenue,\r\nand it was necessary that the royal ransom should be paid off within six\r\nyears. The people, from whom taxes might be always extorted at pleasure,\r\npaid a good share of this, for the fifth of the three millions of _écus\r\nd'or_ was realised from the tax on salt, the thirteenth part from the\r\nduty on the sale of fermented liquors, and twelve deniers per pound from\r\nthe tax on the value of all provisions sold and resold within the kingdom.\r\nCommerce was subjected to a new tax called _imposition foraine_, a measure\r\nmost detrimental to the trade and manufactures of the country, which were\r\ncontinually struggling under the pitiless oppression of the treasury.\r\nRoyal despotism was not always able to shelter itself under the sanction\r\nof the general and provincial councils, and a few provinces, which\r\nforcibly protested against this excise duty, were treated on the same\r\nfooting as foreign states with relation to the transit of merchandise from\r\nthem. Other provinces compounded for this tax, and in this way, owing to\r\nthe different arrangements in different places, a complicated system of\r\nexemptions and prohibitions existed which although most prejudicial to all\r\nindustry, remained in force to a great extent until 1789.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles V.--surnamed the Wise--ascended the throne in 1364, France,\r\nruined by the disasters of the war, by the weight of taxation, by the\r\nreduction in her commerce, and by the want of internal security, exhibited\r\neverywhere a picture of misery and desolation; in addition to which,\r\nfamine and various epidemics were constantly breaking out in various parts\r\nof the kingdom. Besides this, the country was incessantly overrun by gangs\r\nof plunderers, who called themselves _écorcheurs, routiers, tardvenus_,\r\n&c., and who were more dreaded by the country people even than the English\r\nhad been. Charles V., who was celebrated for his justice and for his\r\neconomical and provident habits, was alone capable of establishing order\r\nin the midst of such general confusion. Supported by the vote of the\r\nAssembly held at Compiègne in 1367, he remitted a moiety of the salt tax\r\nand diminished the number of the treasury agents, reduced their wages, and\r\ncurtailed their privileges. He inquired into all cases of embezzlement, so\r\nas to put a stop to fraud; and he insisted that the accounts of the public\r\nexpenditure in its several departments should be annually audited. He\r\nprotected commerce, facilitated exchanges, and reduced, as far as\r\npossible, the rates and taxes on woven articles and manufactured goods. He\r\npermitted Jews to hold funded property, and invited foreign merchants to\r\ntrade with the country. For the first time he required all gold and silver\r\narticles to be stamped, and called in all the old gold and silver coins,\r\nin order that by a new and uniform issue the value of money might no\r\nlonger be fictitious or variable. For more than a century coins had so\r\noften changed in name, value, and standard weight, that in an edict of\r\nKing John we read, \"It was difficult for a man when paying money in the\r\nordinary course to know what he was about from one day to another.\"\r\n\r\nThe recommencement of hostilities between England and France in 1370\r\nunfortunately interrupted the progressive and regular course of these\r\nfinancial improvements. The States-General, to whom the King was obliged\r\nto appeal for assistance in order to carry on the war, decided that salt\r\nshould be taxed one sol per pound, wine by wholesale a thirteenth of its\r\nvalue, and by retail a fourth; that a _fouage_, or hearth tax, of six\r\nfrancs should be established in towns, and of two francs in the\r\ncountry,[*] and that a duty should be levied in walled towns on the\r\nentrance of all wine. The produce of the salt tax was devoted to the\r\nspecial use of the King. Each district farmed its excise and its salt tax,\r\nunder the superintendence of clerks appointed by the King, who regulated\r\nthe assessment and the fines, and who adjudicated in the first instance in\r\nall cases of dispute. Tax-gatherers were chosen by the inhabitants of each\r\nlocality, but the chief officers of finance, four in number, were\r\nappointed by the King. This administrative organization, created on a\r\nsound basis, marked the establishment of a complete financial system. The\r\nAssembly, which thus transferred the administration of all matters of\r\ntaxation from the people at large to the King, did not consist of a\r\ncombination of the three estates, but simply of persons of\r\nposition--namely, prelates, nobles, and bourgeois of Paris, in addition to\r\nthe leading magistrates of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote *: This is the origin of the saying \"smoke farthing.\"]\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the accounts of the 15th November, 1372, is\r\ninteresting, inasmuch as it represents the actual budget of France under\r\nCharles V.:--\r\n\r\n  Article 18.

He seized upon the royal\r\ntreasury, which was concealed in the Castle of Melun, and also upon all\r\nthe savings of the deceased king; and, instead of applying them to\r\nalleviate the general burden of taxation, he levied a duty for the first\r\ntime on the common food of the people. Immediately there arose a general\r\noutcry of indignation, and a formidable expression of resistance was made\r\nin Paris and in the large towns. Mob orators loudly proclaimed the public\r\nrights thus trampled upon by the regent and the King's uncles; the\r\nexpression of the feelings of the masses began to take the shape of open\r\nrevolt, when the council of the regency made an appearance of giving way,\r\nand the new taxes were suppressed, or, at all events, partially abandoned.\r\nThe success of the insurrectionary movement, however, caused increased\r\nconcessions to be demanded by the people. The Jews and tax-collectors were\r\nattacked. Some of the latter were hung or assassinated, and their\r\nregisters torn up; and many of the former were ill-treated and banished,\r\nnotwithstanding the price they had paid for living in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of the States, which was summoned by the King's uncles to\r\nmeet in Paris, sided with the people, and, in consequence, the regent and\r\nhis brother pretended to acknowledge the justice of the claims which were\r\nmade upon them in the name of the people, and, on their withdrawing the\r\ntaxes, order was for a time restored. No sooner, however, was this the\r\ncase than, in spite of the solemn promises made by the council of regency,\r\nthe taxes were suddenly reimposed, and the right of farming them was sold\r\nto persons who exacted them in the most brutal manner. A sanguinary\r\nrevolt, called that of the _Maillotins_, burst forth in Paris; and the\r\ncapital remained for some time in the power of the people, or rather of\r\nthe bourgeois, who led the mob on to act for them (1381-1382). The towns\r\nof Rouen, Rheims, Troyes, Orleans, and Blois, many places in Beauvoise, in\r\nChampagne, and in Normandy, followed the example of the Parisians, and it\r\nis impossible to say to what a length the revolt would have reached had it\r\nnot been for the victory over the Flemish at Rosebecque. This victory\r\nenabled the King's uncles to re-enter Paris in 1383, and to re-establish\r\nthe royal authority, at the same time making the _Maillotins_ and their\r\naccomplices pay dearly for their conduct. The excise duties, the hearth\r\ntax, the salt tax, and various other imposts which had been abolished or\r\nsuspended, were re-established; the taxes on wine, beer, and other\r\nfermented liquors was lowered; bread was taxed twelve deniers per pound,\r\nand the duty on salt was fixed at the excessive rate of twenty francs in\r\ngold--about 1,200 francs of present money--per hogshead of sixty\r\nhundredweight. Certain concessions and compromises were made exceptionally\r\nin favour of Artois, Dauphiné, Poitou, and Saintonge, in consideration of\r\nthe voluntary contributions which those provinces had made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.--Assassination of the Duke of Burgundy, John the\r\nFearless, on the Bridge of Montereau, in 1419.--Fac-simile of a Miniature\r\nin the \"Chronicles\" of Monstrelet, Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in\r\nthe Library of the Arsenal of Paris.]\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the success of their exacting and arbitrary rule, the Dukes\r\nof Anjou, Burgundy, and Berry, under pretext of requiring money for war\r\nexpenses, again increased the taxes from the year 1385 to 1388; and the\r\nsalt tax was raised to forty golden francs, about 24,000 francs of present\r\nmoney, per hogshead. The ecclesiastics paid a half décime to the King, and\r\nseveral décimes to the Pope, but these did not prevent a forced loan being\r\nordered. Happily, Charles VI. about this period attained his majority, and\r\nassumed his position as king; and his uncle, the Duke of Bourbon, who was\r\ncalled to the direction of affairs, re-established comparative order in\r\nfinancial matters; but soon after the King's brother, the Duke of Orleans,\r\nseized the reins of government, and, jointly with his sister-in-law,\r\nIsabel of Bavaria, increased the taxation far beyond that imposed by the\r\nDuke d'Anjou. The Duke of Burgundy, called John the Fearless, in order to\r\ngratify his personal hatred to his cousin, Louis of Orleans, made himself\r\nthe instrument of the strong popular feeling by assassinating that prince\r\nas he was returning from an entertainment. The tragical death of the Duke\r\nof Orleans no more alleviated the ills of France than did that of the Duke\r\nof Burgundy sixteen years later--for he in his turn was the victim of a\r\nconspiracy, and was assassinated on the bridge of Montereau in the\r\npresence of the Dauphin (Fig. 283). The marriage of Isabel of France with\r\nthe young king Richard of England, the ransom of the Christian prisoners\r\nin the East, the money required by the Emperor of Constantinople to stop\r\nthe invasions of the Turks into Europe, the pay of the French army, which\r\nwas now permanent, each necessarily required fresh subsidies, and money\r\nhad to be raised in some way or other from the French people. Distress was\r\nat its height, and though the people were groaning under oppression, they\r\ncontinued to pay not only the increased taxes on provisions and\r\nmerchandise, and an additional general tax, but to submit to the most\r\noutrageous confiscations and robbery of the public money from the public\r\ntreasuries. The State Assemblies held at Auxerre and Paris in 1412 and\r\n1413, denounced the extravagance and maladministration of the treasurers,\r\nthe generals, the excisemen, the receivers of royal dues, and of all those\r\nwho took part in the direction of the finances; though they nevertheless\r\nvoted the taxes, and promulgated most severe regulations with respect to\r\ntheir collection. To meet emergencies, which were now becoming chronic,\r\nextraordinary taxes were established, the non-payment of which involved\r\nthe immediate imprisonment of the defaulter; and the debasement of the\r\ncoinage, and the alienation of certain parts of the kingdom, were\r\nauthorised in the name of the King, who had been insane for more than\r\nfifteen years. The incessant revolts of the bourgeois, the reappearance of\r\nthe English on the soil of France, the ambitious rivalry of Queen Isabel\r\nof Bavaria leagued with the Duke of Burgundy against the Dauphin, who had\r\nbeen made regent, at last, in 1420, brought about the humiliating treaty\r\nof Troyes, by which Henry V., king of England, was to become king of\r\nFrance on the death of Charles VI.\r\n\r\nThis treaty of Troyes became the cause of, and the pretext for, a vast\r\namount of extortion being practised upon the unfortunate inhabitants of\r\nthe conquered country. Henry V., who had already made several exactions\r\nfrom Normandy before he had obtained by force the throne of France, did\r\nnot spare the other provinces, and, whilst proclaiming his good intentions\r\ntowards his future subjects, he added a new general impost, in the shape\r\nof a forced loan, to the taxes which already weighed so heavily on the\r\npeople. He also issued a new coinage, maintained many of the taxes,\r\nespecially those on salt and on liquors, even after he had announced his\r\nintention of abolishing them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Dauphin Charles, surnamed _Roi de Bourges_, because\r\nhe had retired with his court and retinue into the centre of the kingdom\r\n(1422), was sadly in want of money. He alienated the State revenues, he\r\nlevied excise duties and subsidies in the provinces which remained\r\nfaithful to his cause, and he borrowed largely from those members of the\r\nChurch and the nobility who manifested a generous pity for the sad destiny\r\nof the King and the monarchy. Many persons, however, instead of\r\nsacrificing themselves for their king and country, made conditions with\r\nhim, taking advantage of his position. The heir to the throne was obliged\r\nin many points to give way, either to a noble whose services he bargained\r\nfor, or to a town or an abbey whose aid he sought. At times he bought over\r\ninfluential bodies, such as universities and other corporation, by\r\ngranting exemptions from, or privileges in, matters of taxation, &c. So\r\nmuch was this the case that it may be said that Charles VII. treated by\r\nprivate contract for the recovery of the inheritances of his fathers. The\r\ntowns of Paris and Rouen, as well as the provinces of Brittany, Languedoc,\r\nNormandy, and Guyenne, only returned to their allegiance to the King on\r\nconditions more or less advantageous to themselves. Burgundy, Picardy, and\r\nFlanders--which were removed from the kingdom of Charles VII. at the\r\ntreaty of peace of Arras in 1435--cordially adopted the financial system\r\ninaugurated by the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.--The House of Jacques Coeur at Bourges, now\r\nconverted into the Hôtel de Ville.]\r\n\r\nCharles VII. reconquered his kingdom by a good and wise policy as much as\r\nby arms. He, doubtless, had cause to be thankful for the valeur and\r\ndevotion of his officers, but he principally owed the success of his cause\r\nto one man, namely, his treasurer, the famous Jacques Coeur, who possessed\r\nthe faculty of always supplying money to his master, and at the same time\r\nof enriching himself (Fig. 284). Thus it was that Charles VII., whose\r\nfinances had been restored by the genius of Jacques Coeur, was at last\r\nable to re-enter his capital triumphantly, to emancipate Guyenne,\r\nNormandy, and the banks of the Loire from the English yoke, to reattach to\r\nthe crown a portion of its former possessions, or to open the way for\r\ntheir early return, to remove bold usurpers from high places in the State,\r\nand to bring about a real alleviation of those evils which his subjects\r\nhad so courageously borne. He suppressed the fraud and extortion carried\r\non under the name of justice, put a stop to the sale of offices, abolished\r\na number of rates illegally levied, required that the receivers' accounts\r\nshould be sent in biennially, and whilst regulating the taxation, he\r\ndevoted its proceeds entirely to the maintenance and pay of the army. From\r\nthat time taxation, once feudal and arbitrary, became a fixed royal due,\r\nwhich was the surest means of preventing the pillage and the excesses of\r\nthe soldiery to which the country people had been subjected for many\r\nyears. Important triumphs of freedom were thus obtained over the\r\ntyrannical supremacy of the great vassals; but in the midst of all this\r\nimprovement we cannot but regret that the assessors, who, from the time of\r\ntheir creation by St. Louis, had been elected by the towns or the\r\ncorporations, now became the nominees of the crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285.--_Amende honorable_ of Jacques Coeur before\r\nCharles VII.--Fac-simile of a Miniature of the \"Chroniques\" of Monstrelet,\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nPhilip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, taxed his subjects but little:\r\n\"Therefore,\" says Philippe de Commines, \"they became very wealthy, and\r\nlived in much comfort.\" But Louis XI did not imitate him. His first care\r\nwas to reinstate that great merchant, that clever financier, Jacques\r\nCoeur, to whom, as much as to Joan of Arc, the kingdom owed its freedom,\r\nand whom Charles VII., for the most contemptible reasons, had had the\r\nweakness to allow to be judicially condemned Louis XI. would have been\r\nvery glad to entrust the care of his finances to another Jacques Coeur;\r\nfor being sadly in want of money, he ran through his father's earnings,\r\nand, to refill his coffers, he increased taxation, imposed a duty on the\r\nimportation of wines, and levied a tax on those holding offices, &c. A\r\nrevolution broke out in consequence, which was only quenched in the blood\r\nof the insurgents. In this manner he continued, by force of arms, to\r\nincrease and strengthen his own regal power at the expense of feudalism.\r\n\r\nHe soon found himself opposed by the _Ligue du Bien Public_, formed by the\r\ngreat vassals ostensibly to get rid of the pecuniary burden which\r\noppressed the people, but really with the secret intention of restoring\r\nfeudalism and lessening the King's power. He was not powerful enough\r\nopenly to resist this, and appeared to give way by allowing the leagued\r\nnobles immense privileges, and himself consenting to the control of a sort\r\nof council of \"thirty-six notables appointed to superintend matters of\r\nfinance.\" Far from acknowledging himself vanquished, however, he\r\nimmediately set to work to cause division among his enemies, so as to be\r\nable to overcome them. He accordingly showed favour towards the bourgeois,\r\nwhom he had already flattered, by granting new privileges, and abolishing\r\nor reducing certain vexatious taxes of which they complained. The\r\nthirty-six notables appointed to control his financial management reformed\r\nnothing. They were timid and docile under the cunning eye of the King, and\r\npractically assisted him in his designs; for in a very few years the taxes\r\nwere increased from 1,800,000 écus--about 45,000,000 francs of present\r\nmoney--to 3,600,000 écus--about 95,000,000 francs. Towards the end of the\r\nreign they exceeded 4,700,000 écus--130,000,000 francs of present money.\r\nLouis XI. wasted nothing on luxury and pleasure; he lived parsimoniously,\r\nbut he maintained 110,000 men under arms, and was ready to make the\r\ngreatest sacrifices whenever there was a necessity for augmenting the\r\nterritory of the kingdom, or for establishing national unity. At his\r\ndeath, on the 25th of August, 1483, he left a kingdom considerably\r\nincreased in area, but financialty almost ruined.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne de Beaujeu, eldest sister of the King, who was a minor, assumed\r\nthe reins of government as regent, an immediate demand was made for\r\nreparation of the evils to which the finance ministers had subjected the\r\nunfortunate people. The treasurer-general Olivier le Dain, and the\r\nattorney-general Jean Doyat, were almost immediately sacrificed to popular\r\nresentment, six thousand Swiss were subsidised, the pensions granted\r\nduring the previous reign were cancelled, and a fourth part of the taxes\r\nwas removed. Public opinion being thus satisfied, the States-General\r\nassembled. The bourgeois here showed great practical good sense,\r\nespecially in matters of finance; they proved clearly that the assessment\r\nwas illegal, and that the accounts were fictitious, inasmuch as the latter\r\nonly showed 1,650,000 livres of subsidies, whereas they amounted to three\r\ntimes as much. It was satisfactorily established that the excise, the salt\r\ntax, and the revenues of the public lands amply sufficed for the wants of\r\nthe country and the crown. The young King Charles was only allowed\r\n1,200,000 livres for his private purse for two years, and 300,000 livres\r\nfor the expenses of the festivities of his coronation. On the Assembly\r\nbeing dissolved, the Queen Regent found ample means of pleasing the\r\nbourgeois and the people generally by breaking through the engagements she\r\nhad entered into in the King's name, by remitting taxation, and finally by\r\nforce of arms destroying the power of the last remaining vassals of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286.--The Mint.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the\r\nTranslation of the Latin Work of Francis Patricius, \"De l'Institution et\r\nAdministration de la Chose Politique:\" folio, 1520.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.--The receiver of Taxes.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut\r\nin Damhoudere's \"Praxis Rerum Civilium.\"]\r\n\r\nCharles VIII., during a reign of fourteen years, continued to waste the\r\npublic money. His disastrous expedition for the conquest of the kingdom of\r\nNaples forced him to borrow at the rate of forty-two per cent. A short\r\ntime previous to his death he acknowledged his errors, but continued to\r\nspend money, without consideration or restraint, in all kinds of\r\nextravagances, but especially in buildings. During his reign the annual\r\nexpenditure almost invariably doubled the revenue. In 1492 it reached\r\n7,300,000 francs, about 244,000,000 francs of present money. The deficit\r\nwas made up each year by a general tax, \"which was paid neither by the\r\nnobles nor the Church, but was obtained entirely from the people\" (letters\r\nfrom the ambassadors of Venice).\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Orleans ascended the throne as Louis XII., the people\r\nwere again treated with some consideration. Having chosen George d'Amboise\r\nas premier and Florimond Robertet as first secretary of the treasury, he\r\nresolutely pursued a course of strict economy; he refused to demand of his\r\nsubjects the usual tax for celebrating the joyous accession, the taxes\r\nfell by successive reductions to the sum of 2,600,000 livres, about\r\n76,000,000 francs of present money, the salt tax was entirely abolished,\r\nand the question as to what should be the standard measure of this\r\nimportant article was legislated upon. The tax-gatherers were forced to\r\nreside in their respective districts, and to submit their registers to the\r\nroyal commissioners before beginning to collect the tax. By strict\r\ndiscipline pillage by soldiers was put a stop to (Fig. 288).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the resources obtained by the King through mortgaging a\r\npart of the royal domains, and in spite of the excellent administration of\r\nRobertet, who almost always managed to pay the public deficit without any\r\nadditional tax, it was necessary in 1513, after several disastrous\r\nexpeditions to Italy, to borrow, on the security of the royal domains,\r\n400,000 livres, 10,000,000 francs of present money, and to raise from the\r\nexcise and from other dues and taxes the sum of 3,300,000 livres, about\r\n80,000,000 francs of present money. This caused the nation some distress,\r\nbut it was only temporary, and was not much felt, for commerce, both\r\ndomestic and foreign, much extended at the same time, and the sale of\r\ncollectorships, of titles of nobility, of places in parliament, and of\r\nnominations to numerous judicial offices, brought in considerable sums to\r\nthe treasury. The higher classes surnamed the king _Le Roitelet_, because\r\nhe was sickly and of small stature, parsimonious and economical. The\r\npeople called him their \"father and master,\" and he has always been styled\r\nthe father of the people ever since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.--A Village pillaged by Soldiers.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in Hamelmann's \"Oldenburgisches Chronicon.\" in folio, 1599.]\r\n\r\nIn an administrative and financial point of view, the reign of Francis I.\r\nwas not at all a period of revival or of progress. The commencement of a\r\nsounder System of finance is rather to be dated from that of Charles V.;\r\nand good financial organization is associated with the names of Jacques\r\nCoeur, Philip the Good, Charles XI., and Florimond Robertet. As an example\r\nof this, it may be stated that financiers of that time established taxes\r\non registration of all kinds, also on stamps, and on sales, which did not\r\nbefore exist in France, and which were borrowed from the Roman emperors.\r\nWe must also give them the credit of having first commenced a public debt,\r\nunder the name of _rentes perpetuelles_, which at that time realised\r\neight per cent. During this brilliant and yet disastrous reign the\r\nadditional taxes were enormous, and the sale of offices produced such a\r\nlarge revenue that the post of parliamentary counsel realised the sum of\r\n2,000 golden écus, or nearly a million francs of present currency. It was\r\nnecessary to obtain money at any price, and from any one who would lend\r\nit. The ecclesiastics, the nobility, the bourgeois, all gave up their\r\nplate and their jewels to furnish the mint, which continued to coin money\r\nof every description, and, in consequence of the discovery of America, and\r\nthe working of the gold and silver mines in that country, the precious\r\nmetals poured into the hands of the money-changers. The country, however,\r\nwas none the more prosperous, and the people often were in want of even\r\nthe commonest necessaries of life. The King and the court swallowed up\r\neverything, and consumed all the resources of the country on their luxury\r\nand their wars. The towns, the monasteries, and the corporations, were\r\nbound to furnish a certain number of troops, either infantry or cavalry.\r\nBy the establishment of a lottery and a bank of deposit, by the monopoly\r\nof the mines and by the taxes on imports, exports, and manufactured\r\narticles, enormous sums were realised to the treasury, which, as it was\r\nbeing continually drained, required to be as continually replenished.\r\nFrancis I. exhausted every source of credit by his luxury, his caprices,\r\nand his wars. Jean de Beaune, Baron de Semblançay, the old minister of\r\nfinance, died a victim to false accusations of having misappropriated the\r\npublic funds. Robertet, who was in office with him, and William Bochetel,\r\nwho succeeded him, were more fortunate: they so managed the treasury\r\nbusiness that, without meeting with any legal difficulty, they were\r\nenabled to centralise the responsibility in themselves instead of having\r\nit distributed over sixteen branches in all parts of the kingdom, a system\r\nwhich has continued to our day. In those days the office of superintendent\r\nof finance was usually only a short and rapid road to the gibbet of\r\nMontfaucon.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: Gold and Silver Coins of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth\r\nCenturies.\r\n\r\nFig. 289.--Royal d'Or.

Julius Cæsar, in his \"Commentaries,\"\r\ntells us that \"each year the magistrates and princes assigned portions of\r\nland to families as well as to associations of individuals having a common\r\nobject whenever they thought proper, and to any extent they chose, though\r\nin the following year the same authorities compelled them to go and\r\nestablish themselves elsewhere.\" We again find families (_familiæ_) and\r\nassociations of men (_cognationes hominum_) spoken of by Cæsar, in the\r\nbarbaric laws, and referred to in the histories of the Middle Ages under\r\nthe names of _genealogiæ, faramanni, faræ_, &c.; but the extent of the\r\nrelationship (_parentela_) included under the general appellation of\r\n_families_ varied amongst the Franks, Lombards, Visigoths, and Bavarians.\r\nGenerally, amongst all the people of German origin, the relationship only\r\nextended to the seventh degree; amongst the Celts it was determined merely\r\nby a common ancestry, with endless subdivisions of the tribe into distinct\r\nfamilies. Amongst the Germans, from whom modern Europe has its origin, we\r\nfind only three primary groups; namely, first, the family proper,\r\ncomprising the father, mother, and children, and the collateral relatives\r\nof all degrees; secondly, the vassals (_ministeriales_) or servants of the\r\nfree class; and, thirdly, the servants (_mansionarii, coloni, liti,\r\nservi_) of the servile class attached to the family proper (Fig. 296).\r\n\r\nDomestic authority was represented by the _mund_, or head of the family,\r\nalso called _rex_ (the king), who exercised a special power over the\r\npersons and goods of his dependents, a guardianship, in fact, with certain\r\nrights and prerogatives, and a sort of civil and political responsibility\r\nattached to it. Thus the head of the family, who was responsible for his\r\nwife and for those of his children who lived with him, was also\r\nresponsible for his slaves and domestic animals. To such a pitch did these\r\nprimitive people carry their desire that justice should be done in all\r\ncases of infringement of the law, that the head was held legally\r\nresponsible for any injury which might be done by the bow or the sword of\r\nany of his dependents, without it being necessary that he should himself\r\nhave handled either of these weapons.\r\n\r\nLong before the commencement of the Merovingian era, the family, whose\r\nsphere of action had at first been an isolated and individual one, became\r\nincorporated into one great national association, which held official\r\nmeetings at stated periods on the _Malberg_ (Parliament hill). These\r\nassemblies alone possessed supreme power in its full signification. The\r\ntitles given to certain chiefs of _rex_ (king), _dux_ (duke), _graff_\r\n(count), _brenn_ (general of the army), only defined the subdivisions of\r\nthat power, and were applied, the last exclusively, to those engaged in\r\nwar, and the others to those possessing judicial and administrative\r\nfunctions. The duty of dispensing justice was specially assigned to the\r\ncounts, who had to ascertain the cause of quarrels between parties and to\r\ninflict penalties. There was a count in each district and in each\r\nimportant town; there were, besides, several counts attached to the\r\nsovereign, under the title of counts of the palace (_comites palatii_), an\r\nhonourable position, which was much sought after and much coveted on\r\naccount of its pecuniary and other contingent advantages. The counts of\r\nthe palace deliberated with the sovereign on all matters and all questions\r\nof State, and at the same time they were his companions in hunting,\r\nfeasting, and religious exercises; they acted as arbitrators in questions\r\nof inheritance of the crown; during the minority of princes they exercised\r\nthe same authority as that which the constitution gave to sovereigns who\r\nwere of full age; they confirmed the nominations of the principal\r\nfunctionaries and even those of the bishops; they gave their advice on the\r\noccasion of a proposed alliance between one nation and another, on matters\r\nconnected with treaties of peace or of commerce, on military expeditions,\r\nor on exchanges of territory, as well as in reference to the marriage of a\r\nprince, and they incurred no responsibility beyond that naturally attached\r\nto persons in so distinguished a position among a semi-barbarous\r\ncommunity. At first the legates (_legati_), and afterwards the King's\r\nambassadors (_missi dominici_), the bishops and the dukes or commanders of\r\nthe army were usually selected from the higher court officials, such as\r\nthe counts of the palace, whereas the _ministeriales_, forming the second\r\nclass of the royal officials, filled inferior though very honourable and\r\nlucrative posts of an administrative and magisterial character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.--The Familles and the Barbarians.--Fac-simile of\r\na Woodcut in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle,\r\n1552.]\r\n\r\nUnder the Merovingians the legal principle of power was closely bound up\r\nwith the possession of landed property. The subdivision of that power,\r\nhowever, closely followed this union, and the constant ruin of some of the\r\nnobles rapidly increased the power of others, who absorbed to themselves\r\nthe lost authority of their more unfortunate brethren, so much so that the\r\nFrank kings perceived that society would soon escape their rule unless\r\nthey speedily found a remedy for this state of things. It was then that\r\nthe _lois Salique_ and _Ripuaire_ appeared, which were subjected to\r\nsuccessive revisions and gradual or sudden modifications, necessitated by\r\npolitical changes or by the increasing exigencies of the prelates and\r\nnobles. But, far from lessening the supremacy of the King, the national\r\ncustoms which were collected in a code extended the limits of the royal\r\nauthority and facilitated its exercise.\r\n\r\nIn 596, Childebert, in concert with his _leudes_, decided that in future\r\nthe crime of rape should be punished with death, and that the judge of the\r\ndistrict (_pagus_) in which it had been committed should kill the\r\nravisher, and leave his body on the public road. He also enacted that the\r\nhomicide should have the same fate. \"It is just,\" to quote the words of\r\nthe law, \"that he who knows how to kill should learn how to die.\" Robbery,\r\nattested by seven witnesses, also involved capital punishment, and a judge\r\nconvicted of having let a noble escape, underwent the same punishment that\r\nwould have been inflicted on the criminal. The punishment, however,\r\ndiffered according to the station of the delinquent. Thus, for the\r\nnon-observance of Sunday, a Salian paid a fine of fifteen sols, a Roman\r\nseven and a half sols, a slave three sols, or \"his back paid the penalty\r\nfor him.\" At this early period some important changes in the barbaric code\r\nhad been made: the sentence of death when once given had to be carried\r\nout, and no arrangements between the interested parties could avert it. A\r\ncrime could no longer be condoned by the payment of money; robbery even,\r\nwhich was still leniently regarded at that time, and beyond the Rhine even\r\nhonoured, was pitilessly punished by death. We therefore cannot have more\r\nstriking testimony than this of the abridgment of the privileges of the\r\nFrankish aristocracy, and of the progress which the sovereign power was\r\nmaking towards absolute and uncontrolled authority over cases of life and\r\ndeath. By almost imperceptible steps Roman legislation became more humane\r\nand perfect, Christianity engrafted itself into barbarism, licentiousness\r\nwas considered a crime, crime became an offence against the King and\r\nsociety, and it was in one sense by the King's hand that the criminals\r\nreceived punishment.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the baptism of Clovis, the Church had much to do with the\r\nre-arrangement of the penal code; for instance, marriage with a\r\nsister-in-law, a mother-in-law, an aunt, or a niece, was forbidden; the\r\ntravelling shows, nocturnal dances, public orgies, formerly permitted at\r\nfeasts, were forbidden as being profane. In the time of Clotaire, the\r\nprelates sat as members of the supreme council, which was strictly\r\nspeaking the highest court of the land, having the power of reversing the\r\ndecisions of the judges of the lower courts. It pronounced sentence in\r\nconjunction with the King, and from these decisions there was no appeal.\r\nThe nation had no longer a voice in the election of the magistrates, for\r\nthe assemblies of _Malberg_ did not meet except on extraordinary\r\noccasions, and all government and judicial business was removed to the\r\nsupreme and often capricious arbitration of the King and his council.\r\n\r\nAs long as the mayors of the palace of Austrasia, and of that of Burgundy,\r\nwere only temporarily appointed, royal authority never wavered, and the\r\nsovereign remained supreme judge over his subjects. Suddenly, however,\r\nafter the execution of Brunehaut, who was sacrificed to the hatred of the\r\nfeudal lords, the mayoralty of the palace became a life appointment, and,\r\nin consequence, the person holding the office became possessed almost of\r\nsupreme power, and the rightful sovereigns from that time practically\r\nbecame subject to the authority of the future usurpers of the crown. The\r\nedict of 615, to which the ecclesiastical and State nobility were parties,\r\nwas in its laws and customs completely at variance with former edicts. In\r\nresuming their places in the French constitution, the Merovingian kings,\r\nwho had been deprived both of influence and authority, were compelled by\r\nthe Germanic institutions to return to the passive position which their\r\npredecessors had held in the forests of Germany, but they no longer had,\r\nlike the latter, the prestige of military authority to enable them to keep\r\nthe position of judges or arbitrators. The canons of the Council of Paris,\r\nwhich were confirmed by an edict of the King bearing date the 15th of the\r\ncalends of November, 615, upset the political and legal system so firmly\r\nestablished in Europe since the fifth century. The royal power was shorn\r\nof some of its most valuable prerogatives, one of which was that of\r\nselecting the bishops; lay judges were forbidden to bring an ecclesiastic\r\nbefore the tribunals; and the treasury was prohibited from seizing\r\nintestate estates, with a view to increasing the rates and taxes; and it\r\nwas decreed that Jews should not be employed in collecting the public\r\ntaxes. By these canons the judges and other officers of State were made\r\nresponsible, the benefices which had been withdrawn from the _leudes_ were\r\nrestored, the King was forbidden from granting written orders (_præcepta_)\r\nfor carrying off rich widows, young virgins, and nuns; and the penalty of\r\ndeath was ordered to be enforced against those who disobeyed the canons of\r\nthe council. Thence sprung two new species of legislation, one\r\necclesiastical, the other civil, between which royalty, more and more\r\ncurtailed of its authority, was compelled for many centuries to struggle.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Germanic nations the right of justice was inherent to landed\r\nproperty from the earliest times, and this right had reference to things\r\nas well as to persons. It was the patronage (_patrocinium_) of the\r\nproprietor, and this patronage eventually gave origin to feudal\r\njurisdictions and to lordly and customary rights in each domain. We may\r\ninfer from this that under the two first dynasties laws were made by\r\nindividuals, and that each lord, so to speak, made his own.\r\n\r\nThe right of jurisdiction seems to have been so inherent to the right of\r\nproperty, that a landed proprietor could always put an end to feuds and\r\npersonal quarrels, could temporarily bring any lawsuit to a close, and, by\r\nissuing his _ban_, stop the course of the law in his own immediate\r\nneighbourhood--at least, within a given circumference of his residence.\r\nThis was often done during any family festival, or any civil or religious\r\npublic ceremony. On these occasions, whoever infringed the _ban_ of the\r\nmaster, was liable to be brought before his _court_, and to have to pay a\r\nfine. The lord who was too poor to create a court of sufficient power and\r\nimportance obtained assistance from his lord paramount or relinquished the\r\nright of justice to him; whence originated the saying, \"The fief is one\r\nthing, and justice another.\"\r\n\r\nThe law of the Visigoths speaks of nobles holding local courts, similar to\r\nthose of the official judge, count, or bishop. King Dagobert required the\r\npublic and the private judges to act together. In the law of Lombardy\r\nlandlords are mentioned who, in virtue of the double title of nobles and\r\njudges, assumed the right of protecting fugitive slaves taking shelter in\r\ntheir domains. By an article of the Salie law, the noble is made to answer\r\nfor his vassal before the court of the count. We must hence conclude that\r\nthe landlord's judgment was exercised indiscriminately on the serfs, the\r\ncolons, and the vassals, and a statute of 855 places under his authority\r\neven the freemen who resided with other persons.\r\n\r\nFrom these various sources we discover a curious fact, which has hitherto\r\nremained unnoticed by historians--namely, that there existed an\r\nintermediate legislation between the official court of the count and his\r\nsubordinates and the private courts, which was a kind of court of\r\narbitration exercised by the neighbours (_vicini_) without the assistance\r\nof the judges of the county, and this was invested with a sort of\r\nauthority which rendered its decisions binding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.--The Emperor Charlemagne holding in one hand the\r\nGlobe and in the other the Sword.--After a Miniature in the Registers of\r\nthe University of Paris (Archives of the Minister of Public Instruction of\r\nthe University). The Motto, _In scelus exurgo, sceleris discrimina purgo,\r\n_ is written on a Scroll round the Sword.]\r\n\r\nPrivate courts, however, were limited in their power. They were neither\r\nabsolutely independent, nor supreme and without appeal. All conducted\r\ntheir business much in the same way as the high, middle, and lower courts\r\nof the Middle Ages; and above all these authorities towered the King's\r\njurisdiction. The usurpation of ecclesiastical bishops and abbots--who,\r\nhaving become temporal lords, assumed a domestic jurisdiction--was\r\ncurtailed by the authority of the counts, and they were even more obliged\r\nto give way before that of the _missi dominici_, or the official delegates\r\nof the monarch. Charles the Bald, notwithstanding his enormous concessions\r\nto feudalism and to the Church, never gave up his right of final appeal.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the Merovingian epoch, the _mahl_ (_mallus_), the\r\ngeneral and regular assembly of the nation, was held in the month of\r\nMarch. Persons of every class met there clad in armour; political,\r\ncommercial, and judicial interests were discussed under the presidency of\r\nthe monarch; but this did not prevent other special assemblies of the\r\nKing's court (_curia regalis_) being held on urgent occasions. This court\r\nformed a parliament (_parlamentum_), which at first was exclusively\r\nmilitary, but from the time of Clovis was composed of Franks, Burgundians,\r\nGallo-Romans, as well as of feudal lords and ecclesiastics. As, by\r\ndegrees, the feudal System became organized, the convocation of national\r\nassemblies became more necessary, and the administration of justice more\r\ncomplicated. Charlemagne decided that two _mahls_ should be held annually,\r\none in the month of May, the other in the autumn, and, in addition, that\r\nin each county two annual _plaids_ should meet independently of any\r\nspecial _mahls_ and _plaids_ which it should please him to convoke. In\r\n788, the emperor found it necessary to call three general _plaids_, and,\r\nbesides these, he was pleased to summon his great vassals, both clerical\r\nand lay, to the four principal feasts of the year. It may be asserted that\r\nthe idea of royalty being the central authority in matters of common law\r\ndates from the reign of Charlemagne (Fig. 297).\r\n\r\nThe authority of royalty based on law took such deep root from that time\r\nforth, that it maintained itself erect, notwithstanding the weakness of\r\nthe successors of the great Charles, and the repeated infractions of it by\r\nthe Church and the great vassals of the crown (Fig. 298).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.--Carlovingian King in his Palace personifying\r\nWisdom appealing to the whole Human Race.--After a Miniature in a\r\nManuscript of the Ninth Century in the Burgundian Library of Brussels,\r\nfrom a Drawing by Count Horace de Vielcastel.]\r\n\r\nThe authoritative and responsible action of a tribunal which represented\r\nsociety (Fig. 299) thus took the place of the unchecked animosity of\r\nprivate feuds and family quarrels, which were often avenged by the use of\r\nthe gibbet, a monument to be found erected at almost every corner. Not\r\nunfrequently, in those early times, the unchecked passions of a chief of a\r\nparty would be the only reason for inflicting a penalty; often such a\r\nperson would constitute himself sole judge, and, without the advice of any\r\none, he would pass sentence, and even, with his own sword or any other\r\navailable instrument, he would act as his own executioner. The tribunal\r\nthus formed denounced duelling, the pitiless warfare between man and man,\r\nand between family and family, and its first care was to protect, not each\r\nindividual man's life, which was impossible in those days of blind\r\nbarbarism, but at least his dwelling. Imperceptibly, the sanctuary of a\r\nman's house extended, first to towns of refuge, and then to certain public\r\nplaces, such as the church, the _mahlum_, or place of national assemblies,\r\nthe market, the tavern, &c. It was next required that the accused, whether\r\nguilty or not, should remain unharmed from the time of the crime being\r\ncommitted until the day on which judgment was passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299.--The Court of the Nobles.--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in an old Poetical Romance of Chivalry, Manuscript of the\r\nThirteenth Century, in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThis right of revenge, besides being thus circumscribed as to locality,\r\nwas also subject to certain rules as to time. Sunday and the principal\r\nfeasts of the year, such as Advent, Christmas week, and from that time to\r\nthe Epiphany, from the Ascension to the Day of Pentecost, certain vigils,\r\n&c., were all occasions upon which the right of revenge could not be\r\nexercised. \"The power of the King,\" says a clever and learned writer,\r\n\"partook to a certain degree of that of God and of the Saints; it was his\r\nprovince to calm human passions; by the moral power of his seal and his\r\nhand he extended peace over all the great lines of communication, through\r\nthe forests, along the principal rivers, the highways and the byways, &c.\r\nThe _Trêve du Dieu_ in 1035, was the logical application of these humane\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\nWe must not suppose that justice in those days was dispensed without\r\nformalities, and that there were no regular intervals between the various\r\nsteps to be gone through before final judgment was given, and in\r\nconsequence of which some guarantee was afforded that the decisions\r\narrived at were carefully considered. No one was tried without having been\r\npreviously summoned to appear before the tribunal. Under the\r\nCarlovingians, as in previous times, the periods when judicial courts were\r\nheld were regulated by the moon. Preference was given to the day on which\r\nit entered the first quarter, or during the full moon; the summonses were\r\nreturnable by moons or quarter moons--that is, every seventh day. The\r\nsummons was issued four times, after which, if the accused did not appear,\r\nhe lost the right of counterplea, or was nonsuited. The Salic law allowed\r\nbut two summonses before a count, which had to be issued at an interval of\r\nforty nights the one from the other. The third, which summoned the accused\r\nbefore the King, was issued fourteen nights later, and if he had not put\r\nin an appearance before sunset on the fourteenth day, he was placed _hors\r\nde sa parole_, his goods were confiscated, and he forfeited the privilege\r\nof any kind of refuge.\r\n\r\nAmong the Visigoths justice was equally absolute from the count to the\r\ntithe-gatherer. Each magistrate had his tribunal and his special\r\njurisdiction. These judges called to their assistance assessors or\r\ncolleagues, either _rachimbourgs_, who were selected from freemen; or\r\nprovosts, or _échevins_ (_scabini_), whose appointment was of an official\r\nand permanent character. The scabins created by Charlemagne were the first\r\nelected magistrates. They numbered seven for each bench. They alone\r\nprepared the cases and arranged as to the sentence. The count or his\r\ndelegate alone presided at the tribunal, and pronounced the judgment.\r\nEvery vassal enjoyed the right of appeal to the sovereign, who, with his\r\ncourt, alone decided the quarrels between ecclesiastics and nobles, and\r\nbetween private individuals who were specially under the royal protection.\r\nCriminal business was specially referred to the sovereign, the _missi_, or\r\nthe Count Palatine. Final appeal lay with the Count Palatine in all cases\r\nin which the public peace was endangered, such as in revolts or in armed\r\nencounters.\r\n\r\nAs early as the time of the invasion, the Franks, Bavarians, and\r\nVisigoths, when investigating cases, began by an inquiry, and, previously\r\nto having recourse to trials before a judge, they examined witnesses on\r\noath. Then, he who swore to the matter was believed, and acquitted\r\naccordingly. This system was no doubt flattering to human veracity, but,\r\nunfortunately, it gave rise to abuses; which it was thought would be\r\navoided by calling the family and friends of the accused to take an oath,\r\nand it was then administered by requiring them to place their hands on the\r\ncrucifix, on some relics, or on the consecrated Host. These witnesses, who\r\nwere called _conjuratores_, came to attest before the judges not the fact\r\nitself, but the veracity of the person who invoked their testimony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300.--The Judicial Duel. The Plaintiff opening his\r\nCase before the Judge.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the \"Cérémonies des\r\nGages des Batailles,\" Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the National\r\nLibrary of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe number and respectability of the _conjuratores_ varied according to\r\nthe importance of the case in dispute. Gregory of Tours relates, that King\r\nGontran being suspicious as to the legitimacy of the child who afterwards\r\nbecame Clotaire II., his mother, Frédégonde, called in the impartial\r\ntestimony of certain nobles. These, to the number of three hundred, with\r\nthree bishops at their head (_tribus episcopis et trecentis viris\r\noptimis_), swore, or, as we say, made an affidavit, and the queen was\r\ndeclared innocent.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Burgundians and of the Anglians were more severe than\r\nthose of the Germanic race, for they granted to the disputants trial by\r\ncombat. After having employed the ordeal of red-hot iron, and of scalding\r\nwater, the Franks adopted the judicial duel (Fig. 300). This was imposed\r\nfirst upon the disputing parties, then on the witnesses, and sometimes\r\neven on the judges themselves. Dating from the reign of the Emperor Otho\r\nthe Great in 967, the judicial duel, which had been at first restricted to\r\nthe most serious cases, was had recourse to in almost all suits that were\r\nbrought before the courts. Neither women, old men, children, nor infirm\r\npersons were exempted. When a person could not himself fight he had to\r\nprovide a champion, whose sole business was to take in hand the quarrels\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.--Judicial Duel.--Combat of a Knight with a\r\nDog.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Romance of \"Macaire,\" of the\r\nThirteenth Century (Library of the Arsenal of Paris).]\r\n\r\nEcclesiastics were obliged, in the same maimer, to fight by deputy. The\r\nchampion or substitute required, of course, to be paid beforehand. If the\r\nlegend of the Dog of Montargis is to be believed, the judicial duel seems\r\nto have been resorted to even against an animal (Fig. 301).\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century Europe was divided, so to speak, into two vast\r\njudicial zones: the one, Southern, Gallo-Roman, and Visigoth; the other,\r\nNorthern and Western, half Germanic and half Scandinavian, Anglian, or\r\nSaxon. Christianity established common ties between these different\r\nlegislations, and imperceptibly softened their native coarseness, although\r\nthey retained the elements of their pagan and barbaric origin. Sentences\r\nwere not as yet given in writing: they were entrusted to the memory of the\r\njudges who had issued them; and when a question or dispute arose between\r\nthe interested parties as to the terms of the decision which had been\r\npronounced, an inquiry was held, and the court issued a second decision,\r\ncalled a _recordatum_.\r\n\r\nAs long as the King's court was a movable one, the King carried about with\r\nhim the original text of the law in rolls (_rotuli_). It was in\r\nconsequence of the seizure of a number of these by the English, during the\r\nreign of Philip Augustus in 1194, that the idea was suggested of\r\npreserving the text of all the laws as state archives, and of opening\r\nauthentic registers of decisions in civil and criminal cases. As early as\r\nthe time of Charles the Bald, the inconvenience was felt of the high court\r\nof the count being movable from place to place, and having no special\r\nlocality where instructions might be given as to modes of procedure, for\r\nthe hearing of witnesses, and for keeping the accused in custody, &c. A\r\nformer statute provided for this probable difficulty, but there seems to\r\nbe no proof that previous to the twelfth century any fixed courts of\r\njustice had been established. The Kings, and likewise the counts, held\r\ncourts in the open air at the entrance to the palace (Fig. 302), or in\r\nsome other public place--under a large tree, for instance, as St. Louis\r\ndid in the wood of Vincennes.\r\n\r\nM. Desmaze, in his valuable researches on the history of the Parliament of\r\nParis, says--\"In 1191, Philip Augustus, before starting for Palestine,\r\nestablished bailiwicks, which held their assizes once a month; during\r\ntheir sitting they heard all those who had complaints to make, and gave\r\nsummary judgment. The bailiff's assize was held at stated periods from\r\ntime to time, and at a fixed place; it was composed of five judges, the\r\nKing deciding the number and quality of the persons who were to take part\r\nin the deliberations of the court for each session. The royal court only\r\nsat when it pleased the King to order it; it accompanied the King wherever\r\nhe went, so that it had no settled place of residence.\"\r\n\r\nLouis IX. ordered that the courts of the nobles should be consolidated\r\nwith the King's court, and succeeded in carrying out this reform. The\r\nbailiffs who were the direct delegates of the sovereign power, assumed an\r\nauthority before which even the feudal lord was obliged to bend, because\r\nthis authority was supported by the people, who were at that time\r\norganized in corporations, and these corporations were again bound\r\ntogether in communes. Under the bailiffs a system was developed, the\r\nprinciples of which more nearly resembled the Roman legislation than the\r\nright of custom, which it nevertheless respected, and the judicial trial\r\nby duel completely disappeared. Inquiries and appeals were much resorted\r\nto in all kinds of proceedings, and Louis IX. succeeded in controlling the\r\npower of ecclesiastical courts, which had been much abused in reference to\r\nexcommunication. He also suppressed the arbitrary and ruinous\r\nconfiscations which the nobles had unjustly made on their vassals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.--The Palace as it was in the Sixteenth\r\nCentury.--After an Engraving of that Period, National Library of Paris\r\n(Cabinet des Estampes).]\r\n\r\nThe edict of 1276 very clearly established the jurisdiction of parliaments\r\nand bailiwicks; it defined the important duties of the bailiffs, and at\r\nthe same time specified the mode in which proceedings should be taken; it\r\nalso regulated the duties of counsel, _maîtres des requêtes_, auditors,\r\nand advocates.\r\n\r\nTo the bailiwicks already in existence Louis IX. added the four great\r\nassizes of Vermandois, of Sens, of Saint-Pierre-le-Moustier, and of Mâcon,\r\n\"to act as courts of final appeal from the judgment of the nobles.\"\r\nPhilippe le Bel went still further, for, in 1287, he invited \"all those\r\nwho possess temporal authority in the kingdom of France to appoint, for\r\nthe purpose of exercising civil jurisdiction, a bailiff, a provost, and\r\nsome serjeants, who were to be laymen, and not ecclesiastics, and if there\r\nshould be ecclesiastics in the said offices, to remove them.\" He ordered,\r\nbesides, that all those who had cases pending before the court of the King\r\nand the secular judges of the kingdom should be furnished with lay\r\nattorneys; though the chapters, as well as the abbeys and convents, were\r\nallowed to be represented by canons. M. Desmaze adds, \"This really\r\namounted to excluding ecclesiastics from judicial offices, not only from\r\nthe courts of the King, but also from those of the nobles, and from every\r\nplace in which any temporal jurisdiction existed.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of his accession, Hugh Capet was Count of Paris, and as such\r\nwas invested with judicial powers, which he resigned in 987, on the\r\nunderstanding that his county of Paris, after the decease of the male\r\nheirs of his brother Eudes, should return to the crown. In 1032, a new\r\nmagistrate was created, called the Provost of Paris, whose duty it was to\r\ngive assistance to the bourgeois in arresting persons for debt. This\r\nfunctionary combined in his own person the financial and political chief\r\nof the capital, he was also the head of the nobility of the county, he was\r\nindependent of the governor, and was placed above the bailiffs and\r\nseneschals. He was the senior of the urban magistracy and police, leader\r\nof the municipal troops, and, in a word, the prefect (_præfectus urbis_),\r\nas he was called under the Emperor Aurelian, or the first magistrate of\r\nLutetia, as he was still called under Clotaire in 663. Assessors were\r\nassociated with the provost, and together they formed a tribunal, which\r\nwas afterwards known as the Châtelet (Fig. 303), because they assembled in\r\nthat fortress, the building of which is attributed to Julius Caesar. The\r\nfunctions of this tribunal did not differ much from those of the royal\r\n_châtellenies:_ its jurisdiction embraced quarrels between individuals,\r\nassaults, revolts, disputes between the universities and the students, and\r\nimproper conduct generally (_ribaudailles_), in consequence of which the\r\nprovost acquired the popular surname of _Roi des Ribauds_. At first his\r\njudgment was final, but very soon those under his jurisdiction were\r\nallowed to appeal to Parliament, and that court was obliged to have\r\ncertain cases sent back for judgment from the Châtelet. This was, however,\r\ndone only in a few very important instances, notwithstanding frequent\r\nappeals being made to its supreme arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303.--The Great Châtelet of Paris.--Principal Front\r\nopposite the Pont-au-Change.--Fac-simile of an Engraving on Copper by\r\nMérian, in the \"Topographia Galliae\" of Zeller.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the courts of the counts and bailiffs established in\r\ncertain of the large towns, aldermanic or magisterial courts existed,\r\nwhich rather resembled the Châtelet of Paris. Thus the _capiloulat_ of\r\nToulouse, the senior alderman of Metz, and the burgomaster of Strasburg\r\nand Brussels, possessed in each of these towns a tribunal, which judged\r\nwithout appeal, and united the several functions of a civil, criminal, and\r\nsimple police court. Several places in the north of France had provosts\r\nwho held courts whose duties were various, but who were principally\r\ncharged with the maintenance of public order, and with suppressing\r\ndisputes and conflicts arising from the privileges granted to the trade\r\ncorporations, whose importance, especially in Flanders, had much increased\r\nsince the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n\"On his return from abroad, Louis IX. took his seat upon the bench, and\r\nadministered justice, by the side of the good provost of Paris.\" This\r\nprovost was no other than the learned Estienne Boileau, out of respect to\r\nwhom the provostship was declared a _charge de magistrature_. The increase\r\nof business which fell to the provost's office, especially after the\r\nboundaries of Paris were extended by Philip Augustus, caused him to be\r\nreleased from the duty of collecting the public taxes. He was authorised\r\nto furnish himself with competent assistants, who were employed with\r\nmatters of minor detail, and he was allowed the assistance of _juges\r\nauditeurs_. \"We order that they shall be eight in number,\" says an edict\r\nof Philippe le Bel, of February, 1324, \"four of them being ecclesiastics\r\nand four laymen, and that they shall assemble at the Châtelet two days in\r\nthe week, to take into consideration the suits and causes in concert with\r\nour provost....\" In 1343, the provost's court was composed of one King's\r\nattorney, one civil commissioner, two King's counsel, eight councillors,\r\nand one criminal commissioner, whose sittings took place daily at the\r\nChâtelet.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1340 this tribunal had to adjudicate in reference to all the\r\naffairs of the university, and from the 6th of October, 1380, to all those\r\nof the salt-fish market, which were no less numerous, so that its\r\nimportance increased considerably. Unfortunately, numerous abuses were\r\nintroduced into this municipal jurisdiction. In 1313 and 1320, the\r\nofficers of the Châtelet were suspended, on account of the extortions\r\nwhich they were guilty of, and the King ordered an inquiry to be made into\r\nthe matter. The provost and two councillors of the Parliament sat upon it,\r\nand Philip de Valois, adopting its decisions, prescribed fresh statutes,\r\nwhich were naturally framed in such a way as to show the distrust in which\r\nthe Châtelet was then held. To these the officers of the Châtelet promised\r\non oath to submit. The ignorance and immorality of the lay officers, who\r\nhad been substituted for the clerical, caused much disturbance. Parliament\r\nauthorised two of its principal members to examine the officers of the\r\nChâtelet. Twenty years later, on the receipt of fresh complaints,\r\nParliament decided that three qualified councillors, chosen from its own\r\nbody, should proceed with the King's attorney to the Châtelet, so as to\r\nreform the abuses and informalities of that court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.--The King's Court, or Grand Council.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Miniature in the \"Chroniques\" of Froissart, Manuscript of the\r\nFifteenth Century (formerly in the possession of Charles V), in the\r\nLibrary of the Arsenal, Paris.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Philippe le Bel there existed in reality but one\r\nParliament, and that was the _King's Court_. Its action was at once\r\npolitical, administrative, financial, and judicial, and was necessarily,\r\ntherefore, of a most complicated character. Philippe le Bel made it\r\nexclusively a judicial court, defined the territorial limit of its power,\r\nand gave it as a judicial body privileges tending to strengthen its\r\nindependence and to raise its dignity. He assigned political functions to\r\nthe Great Council (_Conseil d'Etat_); financial matters to the chamber of\r\naccounts; and the hearing of cases of heresy, wills, legacies, and dowries\r\nto the prelates. But in opposition to the wise edict of 1295, he\r\ndetermined that Jews should be excluded from Parliament, and prelates from\r\nthe palace of justice; by which latter proceeding he was depriving justice\r\nof the abilities of the most worthy representatives of the Gallican\r\nChurch. But Philippe le Bel and his successors, while incessantly\r\nquarrelling either with the aristocracy or with the clergy, wanted the\r\ngreat judicial bodies which issued the edicts, and the urban or municipal\r\nmagistrates--which, being subject to re-election, were principally\r\nrecruited from among the bourgeois--to be a common centre of opposition to\r\nany attempt at usurpation of power, whether on the part of the Church, the\r\nnobility, or the crown.\r\n\r\nThe Great Days of Troyes (_dies magni Trecenses_), the assizes of the\r\nancient counts of Champagne, and the exchequer of Normandy, were also\r\norganized by Philipe le Bel; and, further, he authorised the maintenance\r\nof a Parliament at Toulouse, a court which he solemnly opened in person on\r\nthe 10th of January, 1302. In times of war the Parliament of Paris sat\r\nonce a year, in times of peace twice. There were, according to\r\ncircumstances, during the year two, three, or four sittings of the\r\nexchequer of Normandy, and two of the Great Days of Troyes, tribunals\r\nwhich were annexed to the Parliament of Paris, and generally presided over\r\nby one of its delegates, and sometimes even by the supreme head of that\r\nhigh court. At the King's council (Fig. 304) it was decided whether a case\r\nshould be reserved for the Parliament of Paris, or passed on either to the\r\nexchequer or to the Great Days of Troyes.\r\n\r\nAs that advanced reformer, Philippe le Bel, died before the institutions\r\nhe had established had taken root, for many years, even down to the time\r\nof Louis XI., a continual conflict for supremacy was waged between the\r\nParliament of Paris and the various courts of the kingdom--between the\r\ncounts and the Parliament, and between the latter and the King, which,\r\nwithout lessening the dignity of the crown, gradually tended to increase\r\nthe influence which the judges possessed. Immediately on the accession of\r\nLouis le Hutin, in 1314, a reaction commenced--the higher clergy\r\nre-entered Parliament; but Philippe le Long took care that the laity\r\nshould be in a majority, and did not allow that in his council of State\r\nthe titled councillors should be more numerous than the lawyers. The\r\nlatter succeeded in completely carrying the day on account of the services\r\nthey rendered, and the influence which their knowledge of the laws of the\r\ncountry gave them. As for centuries the sword had ruled the gown, so,\r\nsince the emancipation of the bourgeois, the lawyers had become masters of\r\nthe administrative and judicial world; and, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthey were still kept in a somewhat inferior position to the peers and\r\nbarons, their opinion alone predominated, and their decision frequently at\r\nonce settled the most important questions.\r\n\r\nAn edict issued at Val Notre-Dame on the 11th of March, 1344, increased\r\nthe number of members of Parliament, which from that time consisted of\r\nthree presidents, fifteen clerical councillors, fifteen lay councillors,\r\ntwenty-four clergymen and sixteen laymen of the Court of Inquiry, and five\r\nclergymen and sixteen laymen of the Court of Petitions. The King filled up\r\nthe vacant seats on the recommendation of the Chancellor and of the\r\nParliament. The reporters were enjoined to write the decisions and\r\nsentences which were given by the court \"in large letters, and far apart,\r\nso that they might be more easily read.\" The duties of police in the\r\ncourts, the keeping of the doors, and the internal arrangements generally\r\nfor those attending the courts and the Parliament, were entrusted to the\r\nushers, \"who divided among themselves the gratuities which were given them\r\nby virtue of their office.\" Before an advocate was admitted to plead he\r\nwas required to take oath and to be inscribed on the register.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament as then established was somewhat similar in its character\r\nto that of the old national representative government under the Germans\r\nand Franks. For centuries it protected the King against the undue\r\ninterference of the spiritual power, it defended the people against\r\ndespotism, but it often lacked independence and political wisdom, and it\r\nwas not always remarkable for its correct appreciation of men and things.\r\nThis tribunal, although supreme over all public affairs, sometimes wavered\r\nbefore the threats of a minister or of a court favourite, succumbed to the\r\ninfluence of intrigues, and adapted itself to the prejudices of the times.\r\nWe see it, in moments of error and of blindness, both condemning eminent\r\nstatesmen and leading citizens, such as Jacques Coeur and Robertet, and\r\nhanding over to the executioner distinguished men of learning and science\r\nin advance of the times in which they lived, because they were falsely\r\naccused of witchcraft, and also doing the same towards unfortunate\r\nmaniacs who fancied they had dealings with the devil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305.--Trial of the Constable de Bourbon before the\r\nPeers of France (1523).--From an Engraving in \"La Monarchie Françoise\" of\r\nMontfauçon.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries all the members of Parliament\r\nformed part of the council of State, which was divided into the Smaller\r\nCouncil and the Greater Council. The Greater Council only assembled in\r\ncases of urgency and for extraordinary and very important purposes, the\r\nSmaller Council assembled every month, and its decisions were registered.\r\nFrom this arose the custom of making a similar registration in Parliament,\r\nconfirming the decisions after they had been formally arrived at. The most\r\nancient edict placed on the register of the Parliament of Paris dates from\r\nthe year 1334, and is of a very important character. It concerns a\r\nquestion of royal authority, and decides that in spiritual matters the\r\nright of supremacy does not belong more to the Pope than to the King.\r\nConsequently Philippe de Valois ordered \"his friends and vassals who shall\r\nattend the next Parliament and the keepers of the accounts, that for the\r\nperpetual record of so memorable a decision, it shall be registered in the\r\nChambers of Parliament and kept for reference in the Treasury of the\r\nCharters.\" From that time \"cases of complaint and other matters relating\r\nto benefices have no longer been discussed before the ecclesiastical\r\njudges, but before Parliament or some other secular court.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the captivity of King John in England, royal authority having\r\nconsiderably declined, the powers of Parliament and other bodies of the\r\nmagistracy so increased, that under Charles VI. the Parliament of Paris\r\nwas bold enough to assert that a royal edict should not become law until\r\nit had been registered in Parliament. This bold and certainly novel\r\nproceeding the kings nevertheless did not altogether oppose, as they\r\nforesaw that the time would come when it might afford them the means of\r\nrepudiating a treaty extorted from them under difficult circumstances\r\n(Fig. 306).\r\n\r\nThe close connection which existed between the various Parliaments and\r\ntheir political functions--for they had occasion incessantly to interfere\r\nbetween the acts of the government and the respective pretensions of the\r\nprovinces or of the three orders--naturally increased the importance of\r\nthis supreme magistracy. More than once the kings had cause to repent\r\nhaving rendered it so powerful, and this was the case especially with the\r\nParliament of Paris. In this difficulty it is interesting to note how the\r\nkings acted. They imperceptibly curtailed the various powers of the other\r\ncourts of justice, they circumscribed the power of the Parliament of\r\nParis, and proportionately enlarged the jurisdiction of the great\r\nbailiwicks, as also that of the Châtelet. The provost of Paris was an\r\nauxiliary as well as a support to the royal power, which nevertheless held\r\nhim in its grasp. The Châtelet was also a centre of action and of\r\nstrength, which counteracted in certain cases parliamentary opposition.\r\nThence arose the most implacable rivalries and dissensions between these\r\nvarious parties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.--Promulgation of an Edict.--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in \"Anciennetés des Juifs,\" (French Translation from Josephus),\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth Century, executed for the Duke of Burgundy\r\n(Library of the Arsenal of Paris.)]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice with what ingenuity and how readily Parliament\r\ntook advantage of the most trifling circumstances or of charges based upon\r\nthe very slightest grounds to summon the officers of the Châtelet before\r\nits bar on suspicion of prevarication or of outrages against religion,\r\nmorals, or the laws. Often were these officers and the provost himself\r\nsummoned to appear and make _amende honourable_ before the assembly,\r\nnotwithstanding which they retained their offices. More than once an\r\nofficer of the Châtelet was condemned to death and executed, but the King\r\nalways annulled that part of the sentence which had reference to the\r\nconfiscation of the goods of the condemned, thus proving that in reality\r\nthe condemnation had been unjust, although for grave reasons the royal\r\nauthority had been unable to save the victim from the avenging power of\r\nParliament. Hugues Aubriot, the provost, was thus condemned to\r\nimprisonment for life on the most trivial grounds, and he would have\r\nundergone capital punishment if Charles V. had abandoned him at the time\r\nof his trial. During the English occupation, in the disastrous reign of\r\nCharles VI., the Châtelet of Paris, which took part with the people, gave\r\nproof of extraordinary energy and of great force of character. The blood\r\nof many of its members was shed on the scaffold, and this circumstance\r\nmust ever remain a reproach to the judges and to those who executed their\r\ncruel sentences, and a lasting crown of glory to the martyrs themselves.\r\n\r\nAn edict of King John, issued after his return from London in 1363, a\r\nshort time before his death, clearly defined the duties of Parliament.\r\nThey were to try cases which concerned peers of France, and such prelates,\r\nchapters, barons, corporations, and councils as had the privilege of\r\nappealing to the supreme court; and to hear cases relating to estates, and\r\nappeals from the provost of Paris, the bailiffs, seneschals, and other\r\njudges (Fig. 307). It disregarded minor matters, but took cognizance of\r\nall judicial debates which concerned religion, the King, or the State. We\r\nmust remark here that advocates were only allowed to speak twice in the\r\nsame cause, and that they were subjected to fine, or at least to\r\nremonstrance, if they were tedious or indulged in needless repetition in\r\ntheir replies, and especially if they did not keep carefully to the facts\r\nof the case. After pleading they were permitted to give a summary in\r\nwriting of \"the principal points of importance as well as their clients'\r\ngrounds of defence.\" Charles V. confirmed these orders and regulations\r\nwith respect to advocates, and added others which were no less important,\r\namong which we find a provision for giving \"legal assistance to poor and\r\ndestitute persons who go to law.\" These regulations of Charles also\r\nlimited the time in which officers of justice were to get through their\r\nbusiness under a certain penalty; they also proclaimed that the King\r\nshould no longer hear minor causes, and that, whatever might be the rules\r\nof the court, they forbad the presidents from deferring their judgment or\r\nfrom retarding the regular course of justice. Charles VI., before he\r\nbecame insane, contributed no less than his father to the establishment on\r\na better footing of the supreme court of the kingdom, as well as that of\r\nthe Châtelet and the bailiwicks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307.--Bailiwick.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the\r\n\"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century, the Parliament of Paris was so organized as not\r\nto require material change till 1789. There were noble, clerical, and lay\r\ncouncillors, honorary members, and _maîtres de requête_, only four of whom\r\nsat; a first president, who was supreme head of the Parliament, a master\r\nof the great chamber of pleas, and three presidents of the chamber, all of\r\nwhom were nominated for life. There were fifteen masters (_maistres_) or\r\nclerical councillors, and fifteen who were laymen, and these were annually\r\napproved by the King on the opening of the session. An attorney-general,\r\nseveral advocates-general, and deputies, who formed a committee or\r\ncollege, constituted the active part of this court, round which were\r\ngrouped consulting advocates (_consiliarii_), pleading advocates\r\n(_proponentes_), advocates who were mere listeners (_audientes_), ushers\r\nand serjeants, whose chief, on his appointment, became a member of the\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nThe official costume of the first president resembled that of the ancient\r\nbarons and knights. He wore a scarlet gown lined with ermine, and a black\r\nsilk cap ornamented with tassels. In winter he wore a scarlet mantle lined\r\nwith ermine over his gown, on which his crest was worked on a shield. This\r\nmantle was fastened to the left shoulder by three gold cords, in order to\r\nleave the sword-side free, because the ancient knights and barons always\r\nsat in court wearing their swords. Amongst the archives of the mayoralty\r\nof London, we find in the \"account of the entry of Henry V., King of\r\nEngland, into Paris\" (on the 1st of December, 1420), that \"the first\r\npresident was in royal dress (_estoit en habit roial_), the first usher\r\npreceding him, and wearing a fur cap; the church dignitaries wore blue\r\nrobes and hoods, and all the others in the procession scarlet robes and\r\nhoods.\" This imposing dress, in perfect harmony with the dignity of the\r\noffice of those who wore them, degenerated towards the fifteenth century.\r\nSo much was this the case, that an order of Francis I. forbad the judges\r\nfrom wearing pink \"slashed hose\" or other \"rakish garments.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early times of monarchy, the judicial functions were performed\r\ngratuitously; but it was the custom to give presents to the judges,\r\nconsisting of sweetmeats, spices, sugar-plums, and preserves, until at a\r\nsubsequent period, 1498, when, as the judges \"preferred money to\r\nsweetmeats,\" says the Chancellor Etienne Pasquier, the money value of the\r\nspices, &c., was fixed by law and made compulsory. In the bills of\r\nexpenses preserved among the national archives, we find that the first\r\npresident of the Parliament of Paris received a thousand _livres parisis_\r\nannually, representing upwards of one hundred thousand francs at the\r\npresent rate of money; the three presidents of the chamber five hundred\r\nlivres, equal to fifty thousand francs; and the other nobles of the said\r\nParliament five _sols parisis_, or six sols three deniers--about\r\ntwenty-five francs--per day for the days only on which they sat. They\r\nreceived, besides, two mantles annually. The prelates, princes, and barons\r\nwho were chosen by the King received no salaries--_ils ne prennent nuls\r\nguaiges_ (law of 27th January, 1367). The seneschals and high bailiffs,\r\nlike the presidents of the chambers, received five hundred livres--fifty\r\nthousand francs. They and the bailiffs of inferior rank were expressly\r\nforbidden from receiving money or fees from the parties in any suit, but\r\nthey were allowed to accept on one day refreshment and bottles of wine.\r\nThe salaries were paid monthly; but this was not always done regularly;\r\nsometimes the King was to blame for this, and sometimes it was owing to\r\nthe ill-nature of the chiefs of finance, or of the receivers and payers.\r\nWhen the blame rested with the King, the Parliament humbly remonstrated or\r\nclosed the court. When, on the contrary, an officer of finance did not pay\r\nthe salaries, Parliament sent him the bailiff's usher, and put him under\r\ncertain penalties until he had done so. The question of salaries was\r\nfrequently arising. On the 9th of February, 1369, \"the court having been\r\nrequested to serve without any remuneration for one Parliament, on the\r\nunderstanding that the King would make up for it another time, the nobles\r\nof the court replied, after private deliberation, that they were ready to\r\ndo the King's pleasure, but could not do so properly without receiving\r\ntheir salaries\" (Register of the Parliament of Paris).\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the fifteenth century, the scale of remuneration\r\nwas not increased. In 1411 it was raised for the whole Parliament to\r\ntwenty-five thousand livres, which, calculated according to the present\r\nrate, amounted to nearly a million francs. In consequence of financial\r\ndifficulties and the general distress, the unpleasant question in\r\nreference to claims for payment of salaries was renewed, with threats that\r\nthe course of justice would be interrupted if they were not paid or not\r\npromised. On the 2nd of October, 1419, two councillors and one usher were\r\nsent to the house of one of the chiefs of finance, with orders to demand\r\npayment of the salaries of the court. In October, 1430, the government\r\nowed the magistrates two years of arrears. After useless appeals to the\r\nRegent, and to the Bishop of Thérouanne, the then Chancellor of France,\r\nthe Parliament sent two of its members to the King at Rouen, who obtained,\r\nafter much difficulty, \"one month's pay, on the understanding that the\r\nParliament should hold its sittings in the month of April.\" In the month\r\nof July, 1431, there was another deputation to the King, \"in order to lay\r\nbefore him the necessities of the court, and that it had for some time\r\nbeen prorogued, and was still prorogued, on account of the non-payment of\r\nsalaries.\" After two months of repeated remonstrance, the deputies only\r\nbringing back promises, the court assumed a menacing aspect; and on the\r\n11th of January, 1437, it pointed out to the chancellor the evil which\r\nwould arise if Parliament ceased to hold its sittings; and this time the\r\nchancellor announced that the salaries would be paid, though six months\r\npassed without any resuit or any practical step being taken in the matter.\r\nThis state of affairs grew worse until the year 1443, when the King was\r\nobliged to plead with the Parliament in the character of an insolvent\r\ndebtor, and, in order to obtain remission of part of his debt to the\r\nmembers, to guarantee to them a part of the salt duties.\r\n\r\nCharles VII, after having reconquered his states, hastened to restore\r\norder. He first occupied himself with the System of justice, the\r\nParliament, the Châtelet, and the bailiwicks; and in April, 1453, in\r\nconcert with the princes, the prelates, the council of State, the judges,\r\nand others in authority, he framed a general law, in one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five articles, which was considered as the great charter of\r\nParliament (Fig. 308). According to the terms of these articles, \"the\r\ncouncillors are to sit after dinner, to get through the minor causes.\r\nPrisoners are to be examined without delay, and to hold no communication\r\nwith any one, unless by special permission. The cases are to be carefully\r\ngone through in their proper order; for courts are instructed to do\r\njustice as promptly for the poor as for the rich, as it is a greater\r\nhardship for the poor to be kept waiting than the rich.\" The fees of\r\nattorneys were taxed and reduced in amount. Those of advocates were\r\nreduced \"to such moderation and fairness, that there should be no cause\r\nfor complaint.\" The judgments by commissary were forbidden. The bailiffs\r\nand seneschals were directed to reside within their districts. The\r\ncouncillors were ordered to abstain from all communication with the\r\nparties in private, and consultations between themselves were to be held\r\nin secret. The judgments given in lawsuits were inscribed in a register,\r\nand submitted every two months to the presidents, who, if necessary,\r\ncalled the reporters to account for any neglect of duty. The reporter was\r\nordered to draw attention to any point of difficulty arising in a suit,\r\nand the execution of sentences or judgments was entrusted to the ushers of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nIn 1454 the King, in consequence of a difficulty in paying the regular\r\ninstalments of the usual salaries of the Parliament, created \"after-dinner\r\nfees\" (_des gages d'après dînées_) of five sols parisis--more than ten\r\nfrancs of our money--per day, payable to those councillors who should hold\r\na second hearing. Matters did not improve much, however; nothing seemed to\r\nproceed satisfactorily, and members of Parliament, deprived of their\r\nsalaries, were compelled to contract a loan, in order to commence\r\nproceedings against the treasury for the non-payment of the amount due to\r\nthem. In 1493, the annual salaries of Parliament were raised to the sum of\r\n40,630 livres, equal to about 1,100,000 francs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308.--Supreme Court, presided over by the King, who is\r\nin the act of issuing a Decree which is being registered by the\r\nUsher.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in Camareu of the \"Information des\r\nRois,\" Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the Library of the Arsenal\r\nof Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe first president received 4 livres, 22 solis parisis--about 140\r\nfrancs--per day; a clerical councillor 25 sols parisis--about 40\r\nfrancs--and a lay councillor 20 sols--about 32 francs. This was an\r\nincrease of a fifth on the preceding year. Charles VIII., in thus\r\nimproving the remuneration of the members of the first court of the\r\nkingdom, reminded them of their duties, which had been too long neglected;\r\nhe told them \"that of all the cardinal virtues justice was the most noble\r\nand most important;\" and he pointed out to them the line of conduct they\r\nwere to pursue. The councillors were to be present daily in their\r\nrespective chambers, from St. Martin's day to Easter, before seven o'clock\r\nin the morning; and from Easter to the closing of Parliament, immediately\r\nafter six o'clock, without intermission, under penalty of punishment.\r\nStrict silence was enforced upon them during the debates; and they were\r\nforbidden to occupy themselves with anything which did not concern the\r\ncase under discussion. Amidst a mass of other points upon which directions\r\nare given, we notice the following: the necessity of keeping secret the\r\nmatters in course of deliberation; the prohibition to councillors from\r\nreceiving, either directly or indirectly, anything in the shape of a\r\ndouceur from the parties in any suit; and the forbidding all attorneys\r\nfrom receiving any bribe or claiming more than the actual expenses of a\r\njourney and other just charges.\r\n\r\nThe great charter of the Parliament, promulgated in April, 1453, was thus\r\namended, confirmed, and completed, by this code of Charles VIII., with a\r\nwisdom which cannot be too highly extolled.\r\n\r\nThe magistrature of the supreme courts had been less favoured during the\r\npreceding reign. Louis XI., that cautious and crafty reformer, after\r\nhaving forbidden ecclesiastical judges to examine cases referring to the\r\nrevenues of vacant benefices, remodelled the secular courts, but he\r\nruthlessly destroyed anything which offended him personally. For this\r\nreason, as he himself said, he limited the power of the Parliaments of\r\nParis and Toulouse, by establishing, to their prejudice, several other\r\ncourts of justice, and by favouring the Châtelet, where he was sure always\r\nto find those who would act with him against the aristocracy. The\r\nParliament would not give way willingly, nor without the most determined\r\nopposition. It was obliged, however, at last to succumb, and to pass\r\ncertain edicts which were most repugnant to it. On the death of Louis XI.,\r\nhowever, it took its revenge, and called those who had been his favourites\r\nand principal agents to answer a criminal charge, for no other reason than\r\nthat they had exposed themselves to the resentment of the supreme court.\r\n\r\nThe Châtelet, in its judicial functions, was inferior to the Parliament,\r\nnevertheless it acquired, through its provost, who represented the\r\nbourgeois of Paris, considerable importance in the eyes of the supreme\r\ncourt. In fact, for two centuries the provost held the privilege of ruling\r\nthe capital, both politically and financially, of commanding the citizen\r\nmilitia, and of being chief magistrate of the city. In the court of\r\naudiences, a canopy was erected, under which he sat, a distinction which\r\nno other magistrate enjoyed, and which appears to have been exclusively\r\ngranted to him because he sat in the place of _Monsieur Saint Loys_ (Saint\r\nLouis), _dispensing justice to the good people of the City of Paris_. When\r\nthe provost was installed, he was solemnly escorted, wearing his cap, to\r\nthe great chamber of Parliament, accompanied by four councillors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.--The Court of a Baron.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut\r\nin the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony of installation he gave his horse to the president, who\r\nhad come to receive him. His dress consisted of a short robe, with mantle,\r\ncollar turned down, sword, and hat with feathers; he also carried a staff\r\nof office, profusely ornamented with silver. Thus attired he attended\r\nParliament, and assisted at the levees of the sovereign, where he took up\r\nhis position on the lowest step of the throne, below the great\r\nChamberlain. Every day, excepting at the vintage time, he was required to\r\nbe present at the Châtelet, either personally or by deputy, punctually at\r\nnine in the morning. There he received the list of the prisoners who had\r\nbeen arrested the day before; after that he visited the prisons, settled\r\nbusiness of various kinds, and then inspected the town. His jurisdiction\r\nextended to several courts, which were presided over by eight deputies or\r\njudges appointed by him, and who were created officers of the Châtelet by\r\nLouis XII. in 1498. Subsequently, these received their appointments direct\r\nfrom the King. Two auditing judges, one king's attorney, one registrar,\r\nand some bailiffs, completed the provost's staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.--Sergeants-at-Arms of the Fourteenth Century,\r\ncarved in Stone.--From the Church of St. Catherine du Val des Ecoliers, in\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nThe bailiffs at the Châtelet were divided into five classes: the _king's\r\nsergeant-at-arms,_ the _sergeants de la douzaine_, the _sergeants of the\r\nmace_, or _foot sergeants,_ the _sergeants fieffés_, and the _mounted\r\nsergeants_. The establishment of these officers dated from the beginning\r\nof the fourteenth century, and they were originally appointed by the\r\nprovost, but afterwards by the King himself. The King's sergeants-at-arms\r\n(Fig. 310) formed his body-guard; they were not under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe high constable, but of the ordinary judges, which proves that they\r\nwere in civil employ. The sergeants _de la douzaine_ were twelve in\r\nnumber, as their name implies, all of whom were in the service of the\r\nprovost; the foot sergeants, who were civilians, were gradually increased\r\nto the number of two hundred and twenty as early as the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century. They acted only in the interior of the capital, and\r\nguarded the city, the suburbs, and the surrounding districts, whereas the\r\nmounted sergeants had \"to watch over the safety of the rural parishes, and\r\nto act throughout the whole extent of the provost's jurisdiction, and of\r\nthat of the viscount of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the changes of the Middle Ages, especially after the\r\ncommunes became free, all those kings who felt the importance of a strict\r\nsystem of justice, particularly St. Louis, Philippe le Bel, and Charles\r\nVIII., had seen the necessity of compiling a record of local customs. An\r\nedict of 1453 orders that \"the custom shall be registered in writing, so\r\nas to be examined by the members of the great council of the Parliament.\"\r\nNevertheless, this important work was never properly carried out, and to\r\nLouis XII. is due the honour of introducing a customary or usage law, and\r\nat the same time of correcting the various modes of procedure, upon which\r\ncustoms and usages had been based, and which had become singularly\r\nantiquated since the edict of 1302.\r\n\r\nNo monarch showed more favour to Parliament than Louis XII. During his\r\nreign of seventeen years we never find complaints from the magistracy for\r\nnot having been paid punctually. But in contrast with this, on the\r\naccession of Francis I., the court complained of not having been paid its\r\nfirst quarter's salary. From that moment claims were perpetually being\r\nmade; there were continually delays, or absolute refusals; the members\r\nwere expecting \"remuneration for their services, in order absolutely to\r\nenable them to support their families and households.\" We can thus judge\r\nof the state of the various minor courts, which, being less powerful than\r\nthe supreme tribunals, and especially than that of Paris, were quite\r\nunable to get their murmurings even listened to by the proper authorities.\r\nThis sad state of things continued, and, in fact, grew worse, until the\r\nassembly of the League, when Mayenne, the chief of the leaguers, in order\r\nto gratify the Parliament, promised to double the salaries, although he\r\nwas unable to fulfil his promise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.--Inferior Court in the Great Bailiwick. Adoption\r\nof Orphan Children.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in J. Damhoudère's \"Refuge et\r\nGarand des Pupilles, Orphelins:\" Antwerp, J. Bellère, 1557.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the sixteenth century the highest French tribunal was\r\nrepresented by nine superior courts--namely, the Parliament of Bordeaux,\r\ncreated on the 9th of June, 1642; the Parliament of Brittany, which\r\nreplaced the ancient _Grands-Jours,_ in March, 1553, and sat alternately\r\nat Nantes and at Rennes; the Parliament of the Dauphiné, established at\r\nGrenoble in 1451 to replace the Delphinal Council; the Parliament of\r\nBurgundy, established at Dijon in 1477, which took the place of the\r\n_Grands-Jours_ at Beaune; the movable Parliament of Dombes, created in\r\n1528, and consisting at the same time of a court of excise and a chamber\r\nof accounts; the Parliament of Normandy, established by Louis XII. in\r\nApril, 1504, intended to replace the Exchequer of Rouen, and the ancient\r\nducal council of the province; the Parliament of Provence, founded at Aix\r\nin July, 1501; the Parliament of Toulouse, created in 1301; and the\r\nParliament of Paris, which took precedence of all the others, both on\r\naccount of its origin, its antiquity, the extent of its jurisdiction, the\r\nnumber of its prerogatives, and the importance of its decrees. In 1551,\r\nHenry II. created, besides these, an inferior court in each bailiwick, the\r\nduties of which were to hear, on appeal, all matters in which sums of less\r\nthan two hundred livres were involved (Fig. 311). There existed, besides,\r\na branch of the _Grands-Jours,_ occasionally sitting at Poitiers, Bayeux,\r\nand at some other central towns, in order to suppress the excesses which\r\nat times arose from religious dissensions and political controversy.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Paris--or _Great French Parliament_, as it was called by\r\nPhilip V. and Charles V., in edicts of the 17th of November, 1318, and of\r\nthe 8th of October, 1371--was divided into four principal chambers: the\r\nGrand Chamber, the Chamber of Inquiry, the Criminal Chamber, and the\r\nChamber of Appeal. It was composed of ordinary councillors, both clerical\r\nand lay; of honorary councillors, some of whom were ecclesiastics, and\r\nothers members of the nobility; of masters of inquiry; and of a\r\nconsiderable number of officers of all ranks (Figs. 312 to 314). It had at\r\ntimes as many as twenty-four presidents, one hundred and eighty-two\r\ncouncillors, four knights of honour, four masters of records; a public\r\nprosecutor's office was also attached, consisting of the king's counsel,\r\nan attorney-general and deputies, thus forming an assembly of from fifteen\r\nto twenty persons, called a _college_. Amongst the inferior officers we\r\nmay mention twenty-six ushers, four receivers-general of trust money,\r\nthree commissioners for the receipt of goods which had been seized under\r\ndistress, one treasurer and paymaster, three controllers, one physician,\r\ntwo surgeons, two apothecaries, one matron, one receiver of fines, one\r\ninspector of estates, several keepers of refreshment establishments, who\r\nresided within the precincts of the palace, sixty or eighty notaries, four\r\nor five hundred advocates, two hundred attorneys, besides registers and\r\ndeputy registers. Down to the reign of Charles VI. (1380--1422) members of\r\nParliament held their appointment by commissions granted by the King, and\r\nrenewed eaeh session. From Charles VI. to Francis I. these appointments\r\nbecame royal charges; but from that time, owing to the office being so\r\noften prostituted for reward, it got more and more into disrepute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312.--Judge.--From a Drawing in \"Proverbes, Adages,\r\n&c.,\" Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the Imperial Library of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nLouis XI. made the office of member of the Parliament of Paris a\r\npermanent one, and Francis I. continued this privilege. In 1580 the\r\nsupreme magistracy poured 140,000,000 francs, which now would be worth\r\nfifteen or twenty times as much, into the State treasury, so as to enable\r\nmembers to sit permanently _sur les fleurs de lis_, and to obtain\r\nhereditary privileges. The hereditary transmission of office from father\r\nto son dealt a heavy blow at the popularity of the parliamentary body,\r\nwhich had already deeply suffered through shameful abuses, the enormity of\r\nthe fees, the ignorance of some of the members, and the dissolute habits\r\nof many others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313.--Lawyer.--From the \"Danse des Morts\" of Basle,\r\nengraved by Mérian: in 4to, Frankfort, 1596.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.--Barrister.--From a Woodout in the \"Danse\r\nMacabre:\" Guyot's edition, 1490.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.--Assembly of the Provostship of the Merchants of\r\nParis.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in \"Ordonnances Royaux de la Jurisdiction\r\nde la Prevoté des Marchands et Eschevinage de la Ville de Paris:\" in small\r\nfolio, goth. edition of Paris, Jacques Nyverd, 1528.]\r\n\r\nThe Châtelet, on the contrary, was less involved in intrigue, less\r\noccupied with politics, and was daily engaged in adjudicating in cases of\r\nlitigation, and thus it rendered innumerable services in promoting the\r\npublic welfare, and maintained, and even increased, the respect which it\r\nhad enjoyed from the commencement of its existence. In 1498, Louis XII.\r\nrequired that the provost should possess the title of doctor _in utroque\r\njure_, and that his officers, whom he made to hold their appointments for\r\nlife, should be chosen from amongst the most distinguished counsellors at\r\nlaw. This excellent arrangement bore its fruits. As early as 1510, the\r\n\"Usages of the City, Provosty, and Viscounty of Paris,\" were published _in\r\nextenso_, and were then received with much ceremony at a solemn audience\r\nheld on the 8th of March in the episcopal palace, and were deposited among\r\nthe archives of the Châtelet (Fig. 315).\r\n\r\nThe Parliament held a very different line of policy from that adopted by\r\nthe Châtelet, which only took a political part in the religious troubles\r\nof Protestantism and the League with a view to serve and defend the cause\r\nof the people. In spite of its fits of personal animosity, and its\r\nrebellious freaks, Parliament remained almost invariably attached to the\r\nside of the King and the court. It always leaned to the absolute\r\nmaintenance of things as they were, instead of following progress and\r\nchanges which time necessitated. It was for severe measures, for\r\nintimidation more than for gentleness and toleration, and it yielded\r\nsooner or later to the injunctions and admonitions of the King, although,\r\nat the same time, it often disapproved the acts which it was asked to\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316.--Seal of King Chilpéric, found in his Tomb at\r\nTournay in 1654.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecret Tribunals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Old Man of the Mountain and his Followers in Syria.--The Castle of\r\n  Alamond, Paradise of Assassins.--Charlemagne the Founder of Secret\r\n  Tribunals amongst the Saxons.--The Holy Vehme.--Organization of the\r\n  Tribunal of the _Terre Rouge_, and Modes adopted in its\r\n  Procedures.--Condemnations and Execution of Sentences.--The Truth\r\n  respecting the Free Judges of Westphalia.--Duration and Fall of the\r\n  Vehmic Tribunal.--Council of Ten in Venice; its Code and Secret\r\n  Decisions.--End of the Council of Ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, human life was generally held in small respect;\r\nvarious judicial institutions--if not altogether secret, at least more or\r\nless enveloped in mystery--were remarkable for being founded on the\r\nmonstrous right of issuing the most severe sentences with closed doors,\r\nand of executing these sentences with inflexible rigour on individuals who\r\nhad not been allowed the slightest chance of defending themselves.\r\n\r\nWhile passing judgment in secret, they often openly dealt blows as\r\nunexpected and terrible as they were fatal. Therefore, the most innocent\r\nand the most daring trembled at the very name of the _Free Judges of the\r\nTerre-Rouge,_ an institution which adopted Westphalia as the special, or\r\nrather as the central, region of its authority; the _Council of Ten_\r\nexercised their power in Venice and the states of the republic; and the\r\n_Assassins_ of Syria, in the time of St. Louis, made more than one\r\ninvasion into Christian Europe. We must nevertheless acknowledge that,\r\nterrible as these mysterious institutions were, the general credulity, the\r\ngross ignorance of the masses, and the love of the marvellous, helped not\r\na little to render them even more outrageous and alarming than they really\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo, the celebrated Venetian traveller of the thirteenth century,\r\nsays, \"We will speak of the Old Man of the Mountain. This prince was named\r\nAlaodin. He had a lovely garden full of all manner of trees and fruits, in\r\na beautiful valley, surrounded by high hills; and all round these\r\nplantations were various palaces and pavilions, decorated with works of\r\nart in gold, with paintings, and with furniture of silk. Therein were to\r\nbe seen rivulets of wine, as well as milk, honey, and gentle streams of\r\nlimpid water. He had placed therein damsels of transcendent beauty and\r\nendowed with great charms, who were taught to sing and to play all manner\r\nof instruments; they were dressed in silk and gold, and continually walked\r\nin these gardens and palaces. The reasons for which the Old Man had these\r\npalaces built were the following. Mahomet having said that those who\r\nshould obey his will should go to paradise, and there find all kinds of\r\nluxuries, this prince wished it to be believed that he was the prophet and\r\ncompanion of Mahomet, and that he had the power of sending whom he chose\r\nto paradise. No one could succeed in entering the garden, because an\r\nimpregnable castle had been built at the entrance of the valley, and it\r\ncould only be approached by a covered and secret way. The Old Man had in\r\nhis court some young men from ten to twenty years of age, chosen from\r\nthose inhabitants of the hills who seemed to him capable of bearing arms,\r\nand who were bold and courageous. From time to time he administered a\r\ncertain drink to ten or twelve of these young men, which sent them to\r\nsleep, and when they were in deep stupor, he had them carried into the\r\ngarden. When they awoke, they saw all we have described: they were\r\nsurrounded by the young damsels, who sang, played instruments together,\r\ncaressed them, played all sorts of games, and presented them with the most\r\nexquisite wines and meats (Fig. 317). So that these young men, satiated\r\nwith such pleasures, did not doubt that they were in paradise, and would\r\nwillingly have never gone out of it again.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of four or five days, the Old Man sent them to sleep again,\r\nand had them removed from the garden in the same way in which they had\r\nbeen brought in. He then called them before him, and asked them where they\r\nhad been. 'By your grace, lord,' they answered, 'we have been in\r\nparadise.' And then they related, in the presence of everybody, what they\r\nhad seen there. This tale excited the astonishment of all those who heard\r\nit, and the desire that they might be equally fortunate. The Old Man would\r\nthen formally announce to those who were present, as follows: 'Thus saith\r\nthe law of our prophet, He causes all who fight for their Lord to enter\r\ninto paradise; if you obey me you shall enjoy that happiness.' By such\r\nwords and plans this prince had so accustomed them to believe in him, that\r\nhe whom he ordered to die for his service considered himself lucky. All\r\nthe nobles or other enemies of the Old Man of the Mountain were put to\r\ndeath by the assassins in his service; for none of them feared death,\r\nprovided he complied with the orders and wishes of his lord. However\r\npowerful a man might be, therefore, if he was an enemy of the Old Man's,\r\nhe was sure to meet with an untimely end.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.--The Castle of Alamond and its\r\nEnchantments.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in \"Marco Polo's Travels,\"\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth. Century, in the Library of the Arsenal of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nIn his story, which we translate literally from the original, written in\r\nancient French, the venerable traveller attributes the origin of this\r\nsingular system of exercising power over the minds of persons to a prince\r\nwho in reality did but keep up a tradition of his family; for the Alaodin\r\nherein mentioned is no other than a successor of the famous Hassan, son of\r\nAli, who, in the middle of the eleventh century, took advantage of the\r\nwars which devastated Asia to create himself a kingdom, comprising the\r\nthree provinces of Turkistan, Djebel, and Syria. Hassan had embraced the\r\ndoctrine of the Ishmaelian sect, who pretended to explain allegorically\r\nall the precepts of the Mahometan religion, and who did away with public\r\nworship, and originated a creed which was altogether philosophical. He\r\nmade himself the chief exponent of this doctrine, which, by its very\r\nsimplicity, was sure to attract to him many people of simple and sincere\r\nminds. Attacked by the troops of the Sultan Sindgar, he defended himself\r\nvigorously and not unsuccessfully; but, fearing lest he should fall in an\r\nunequal and protracted struggle against an adversary more powerful than\r\nhimself, he had recourse to cunning so as to obtain peace. He entranced,\r\nor fascinated probably, by means analogous to those related by Marco Polo,\r\na slave, who had the daring, during Sindgar's sleep, to stick a sharp\r\ndagger in the ground by the side of the Sultan's head. On waking, Sindgar\r\nwas much alarmed. A few days after, Hassan wrote to him, \"If one had not\r\ngood intentions towards the Sultan, one might have driven the dagger,\r\nwhich was stuck in the earth by his head, into his bosom.\" The Sultan\r\nSindgar then made peace with the chief of the Ishmaelians, whose dynasty\r\nlasted for one hundred and seventy years.\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Alamond, built on the confines of Persia, on the top of a\r\nhigh mountain surrounded with trees, after having been the usual residence\r\nof Hassan, became that of his successors. As in the native language the\r\nsame word means both _prince_ and _old man_, the Crusaders who had heard\r\nthe word pronounced confounded the two, and gave the name of _Old Man of\r\nthe Mountain_ to the Ishmaelian prince at that time inhabiting the Castle\r\nof Alamond, a name which has remained famous in history since the period\r\nwhen the Sire de Joinville published his \"Mémoires.\"\r\n\r\nAncient authors call the subjects of Hassan, _Haschichini, Heississini,\r\nAssissini, Assassini_, various forms of the same expression, which, in\r\nfact, has passed into French with a signification which recalls the\r\nsanguinary exploits of the Ishmaelians. In seeking for the etymology of\r\nthis name, one must suppose that Haschichini is the Latin transformation\r\nof the Arabic word Hachychy, the name of the sect of which we are\r\nspeaking, because the ecstacies during which they believed themselves\r\nremoved to paradise were produced by means of _haschisch_ or _haschischa_.\r\nWe know that this inebriating preparation, extracted from hemp, really\r\nproduces the most strange and delicious hallucinations on those who use\r\nit. All travellers who have visited the East agree in saying that its\r\neffects are very superior to those of opium. We evidently must attribute\r\nto some ecstatic vision the supposed existence of the enchanted gardens,\r\nwhich Marco Polo described from popular tales, and which, of course, never\r\nexisted but in the imagination of the young men, who were either mentally\r\nexcited after fasting and prayer, or intoxicated by the haschischa, and\r\nconsequently for a time lulled in dreams of celestial bliss which they\r\nimagined awaited them under the guidance of Hassan and his descendants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.--The Old Man of the Mountain giving Orders to his\r\nFollowers.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the \"Travels of Marco Polo,\"\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth Century (Library of the Arsenal of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe Haschischini, whom certain contemporary historians describe to us as\r\ninfatuated by the hope of some future boundless felicity, owe their\r\nmelancholy celebrity solely to the blind obedience with which they\r\nexecuted the orders of their chiefs, and to the coolness with which they\r\nsought the favourable moment for fulfilling their sanguinary missions\r\n(Fig. 318). The Old Man of the Mountain (the master of daggers, _magister\r\ncultellorum_, as he is also called by the chronicler Jacques de Vintry),\r\nwas almost continually at war with the Mussulman princes who reigned from\r\nthe banks of the Nile to the borders of the Caspian Sea. He continually\r\nopposed them with the steel of his fanatical emissaries; at times, also,\r\nmaking a traffic and merchandise of murder, he treated for a money payment\r\nwith the sultans or emirs, who were desirous of ridding themselves of an\r\nenemy. The Ishmaelians thus put to death a number of princes and Mahometan\r\nnobles; but, at the time of the Crusades, religious zeal having incited\r\nthem against the Christians, they found more than one notable victim in\r\nthe ranks of the Crusaders. Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, was\r\nassassinated by them; the great Salah-Eddin (Saladin) himself narrowly\r\nescaped them; Richard Coeur de Lion and Philip Augustus were pointed out\r\nto the assassins by the Old Man, who subsequently, on hearing of the\r\nimmense preparations which Louis IX. was making for the Holy War, had the\r\ndaring to send two of his followers to France, and even into Paris, with\r\norders to kill that monarch in the midst of his court. This king, after\r\nhaving again escaped, during his sojourn in Palestine, from the murderous\r\nattempts of the savage messengers of the Prince of Alamond, succeeded, by\r\nhis courage, his firmness, and his virtues, in inspiring these fanatics\r\nwith so much respect, that their chief, looking upon him as protected by\r\nheaven, asked for his friendship, and offered him presents, amongst which\r\nwas a magnificent set of chessmen, in crystal, ornamented with gold and\r\namber.\r\n\r\nThe successors of Hassan, simultaneously attacked by the Moguls under\r\nHoulayon, and by the Egyptians commanded by the Sultan Bibars, were\r\nconquered and dispossessed of their States towards the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century; but, long after, the Ishmaelians, either because their\r\nchiefs sought to recover their power, or because they had placed their\r\ndaggers at the disposal of some foreign foe, continued notorious in\r\nhistory. At last the sect became extinct, or, at least, retired into\r\nobscurity, and renounced its murderous profession, which had for so long\r\nmade its members such objects of terror.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen how a legion of fanatics in the East made themselves the\r\nblind and formidable tools of a religious and political chieftain, who was\r\nno less ambitious than revengeful. If we now turn our attention to\r\nGermany, we shall here find, almost at the same period, a local\r\ninstitution which, although very different from the sanguinary court of\r\nthe Old Man of the Mountain, was of an equally terrible and mysterious\r\ncharacter. We must not, however, look at it from the same point of view,\r\nfor, having been founded with the object of furthering and defending the\r\nestablishment of a regular social state, which had been approved and\r\nsanctioned by the sovereigns, and recognised by the Church, it at times\r\nrendered great service to the cause of justice and humanity at a period\r\nwhen might usurped right, and when the excesses and the crimes of\r\nshameless evil-doers, and of petty tyrants, entrenched in their\r\nimpregnable strongholds, were but too often made lawful from the simple\r\nfact that there was no power to oppose them.\r\n\r\nThe secret tribunal of Westphalia, which held its sittings and passed\r\nsentence in private, and which carried out its decrees on the spot, and\r\nwhose rules, laws, and actions were enveloped in deep mystery, must\r\nunquestionably be looked upon as one of the most remarkable institutions\r\nof the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 319 and 320.--Hermensul or Irmensul and Crodon, Idols\r\nof the Ancient Saxons.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the \"Annales Circuli\r\nWestphaliæ,\" by Herman Stangefol: in 4to, 1656.--The Idol Hermensul\r\nappears to have presided over Executive Justice, the attributes of which\r\nit holds in its hands.]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to state exactly at what period this formidable\r\ninstitution was established. A few writers, and amongst these Sebastian\r\nMunster, wish us to believe that it was founded by Charlemagne himself.\r\nThey affirm that this monarch, having subjugated the Saxons to his sway,\r\nand having forced them to be baptized, created a secret tribunal, the\r\nduties of which were to watch over them, in order that they might not\r\nreturn to the errors of Paganism. However, the Saxons were incorrigible,\r\nand, although Christians, they still carried on the worship of their idols\r\n(Figs. 319 and 320); and, for this reason, it is said by these authorities\r\nthat the laws of the tribunal of Westphalia were founded by Charlemagne.\r\nIt is well known that from the ninth to the thirteenth century, all that\r\npart of Germany between the Rhine and the Weser suffered under the most\r\ncomplete anarchy. In consequence of this, and of the increase of crime\r\nwhich remained unpunished, energetic men established a rigorous\r\njurisdiction, which, to a certain extent, suppressed these barbarous\r\ndisorders, and gave some assurance to social intercourse; but the very\r\nmystery which gave weight to the institution was the cause of its origin\r\nbeing unknown. It is only mentioned, and then cursorily, in historical\r\ndocuments towards the early part of the fifteenth century. This court of\r\njudicature received the name of _Femgericht_, or _Vehmgericht_, which\r\nmeans Vehmic tribunal. The origin of the word _Fem_, _Vehm_, or _Fam_,\r\nwhich has given rise to many scientific discussions, still remains in\r\ndoubt. The most generally accepted opinion is, that it is derived from a\r\nLatin expression--_vemi_ (_vae mihi_), \"woe is me!\"\r\n\r\nThe special dominion over which the Vehmic tribunal reigned supreme was\r\nWestphalia, and the country which was subjected to its laws was designated\r\nas the _Terre Rouge_. There was no assembly of this tribunal beyond the\r\nlimits of this Terre Rouge, but it would be quite impossible to define\r\nthese limits with any accuracy. However, the free judges, assuming the\r\nright of suppressing certain crimes committed beyond their territory, on\r\nmore than one occasion summoned persons living in various parts of\r\nGermany, and even in provinces far from Westphalia, to appear before them.\r\nWe do not know all the localities wherein the Vehmic tribunal sat; but the\r\nmost celebrated of them, and the one which served as a model for all the\r\nrest, held its sittings under a lime-tree, in front of the castle-gate of\r\nDortmund (Fig. 321). There the chapters-general of the association usually\r\nassembled; and, on certain occasions, several thousands of the free judges\r\nwere to be seen there.\r\n\r\nEach tribunal was composed of an unlimited number of free judges, under\r\nthe presidency of a free count, who was charged with the higher\r\nadministration of Vehmic justice. A _free county_ generally comprised\r\nseveral free tribunals, or _friestuhle_. The free count, who was chosen by\r\nthe prince of the territory in which the tribunal sat, had two courts, one\r\nsecret, the other public. The public assizes, which took place at least\r\nthree times a year, were announced fourteen days beforehand, and any\r\nperson living within the _county_, and who was summoned before the free\r\ncount, was bound to appear, and to answer all questions which might be put\r\nto him. It was required that the free judges (who are generally mentioned\r\nas _femnoten_--that is to say, _sages_--and who are, besides, denoted by\r\nwriters of the time by the most honourable epithets: such as, \"serious\r\nmen,\" \"very pious,\" \"of very pure morals,\" \"lovers of justice,\" &c.)\r\nshould be persons who had been born in lawful wedlock, and on German soil;\r\nthey were not allowed to belong to any religions order, or to have ever\r\nthemselves been summoned before the Vehmic tribunal. They were nominated\r\nby the free counts, but subject to the approval of their sovereigns. They\r\nwere not allowed to sit as judges before having been initiated into the\r\nmysteries of the tribunals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.--View of the Town of Dortmund in the Sixteenth\r\nCentury.--From an Engraving on Copper in P. Bertius's \"Theatrum\r\nGeographicum.\"]\r\n\r\nThe initiation of a free judge was accompanied by extraordinary\r\nformalities. The candidate appeared bareheaded; he knelt down, and,\r\nplacing two fingers of his right hand on his naked sword and on a rope,\r\nhe took oath to adhere to the laws and customs of the holy tribunal, to\r\ndevote his five senses to it, and not to allow himself to be allured\r\ntherefrom either by silver, gold, or even precious stones; to forward the\r\ninterests of the tribunal \"above everything illumined by the sun, and all\r\nthat the rain reaches;\" and to defend them \"against everything which is\r\nbetween heaven and earth.\" The candidate was then given the sign by which\r\nmembers of the association recognised each other. This sign has remained\r\nunknown; and nothing, even in the deeds of the Vehmic archives, leads one\r\neven to guess what it was, and every hypothesis on this subject must be\r\nlooked upon as uncertain or erroneous. By one of the fundamental statutes\r\nof the Terre Rouge, a member convicted of betraying the secrets of the\r\norder was condemned to the most cruel punishment; but we have every reason\r\nfor asserting that this sentence was never carried out, or even issued\r\nagainst a free judge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.--The Landgrave of Thuringia and his\r\nWife.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the Collection of the Minnesinger,\r\nManuscript of the Fourteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nIn one case alone during the fourteenth century, was an accusation of\r\nthis sort made, and that proved to be groundless.\r\n\r\nIt would have been considered the height of treason to have given a\r\nrelation, or a friend, the slightest hint that he was being pursued, or\r\nthat he had been condemned by the Holy Vehme, in order that he might seek\r\nrefuge by flight. And in consequence of this, there was a general mistrust\r\nof any one belonging to the tribunal, so much so that \"a brother,\" says a\r\nGerman writer, \"often feared his brother, and hospitality was no longer\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe functions of free judges consisted in going about the country seeking\r\nout crimes, denouncing them, and inflicting immediate punishment on any\r\nevil-doer caught in the act (Figs. 323 and 324). The free judges might\r\nassemble provided there were at least seven in number to constitute a\r\ntribunal; but we hear of as many as three hundred assisting at a meeting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 323 and 324.--Free Judges.--Fac-simile of two\r\nWoodcuts in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, 1552.]\r\n\r\nIt has been erroneously stated that the sittings of the Vehmic tribunals\r\nwere held at night in the depths of forests, or in subterranean places;\r\nbut it appears that all criminal business was first heard in public, and\r\ncould only be subjected to a secret judgment when the accused had failed\r\neither publicly to justify himself or to appear in person.\r\n\r\nWhen three free judges caught a malefactor in the very act, they could\r\nseize him, judge him, and inflict the penalty on the spot. In other cases,\r\nwhen a tribunal considered that it should pursue an individual, it\r\nsummoned him to appear before it. The summons had to be written, without\r\nerasures, on a large sheet of vellum, and to bear at least seven\r\nseals--that of the free count, and those of six free judges; and these\r\nseals generally represented either a man in full armour holding a sword,\r\nor a simple sword blade, or other analagous emblems (Figs. 325 to 327).\r\nTwo free judges delivered the summons personally where a member of the\r\nassociation was concerned; but if the summons affected an individual who\r\nwas not of the Vehmic order, a sworn messenger bore it, and placed it in\r\nthe very hands of the person, or slipped it into his house. The time given\r\nfor putting in an appearance was originally six weeks and three days at\r\nleast, but at a later period this time was shortened. The writ of summons\r\nwas repeated three times, and each time bore a greater number of seals of\r\nfree judges, so as to verify the legality of the instrument. The accused,\r\nwhether guilty or not, was liable to a fine for not answering the first\r\nsummons, unless he could prove that it was impossible for him to have done\r\nso. If he failed to appear on the third summons, he was finally condemned\r\n_en corps et en honneur_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325.--Seal of Herman Loseckin, Free Count of Medebach,\r\nin 1410.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326.--Seal of the Free Count, Hans Vollmar von Twern,\r\nat Freyenhagen, in 1476-1499.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327.--Seal of Johann Croppe, Free Count of Kogelnberg,\r\nin 1413.]\r\n\r\nWe have but imperfect information as to the formalities in use in the\r\nVehmic tribunals. But we know that the sittings were invested with a\r\ncertain solemnity and pomp. A naked sword--emblematical of justice, and\r\nrecalling our Saviour's cross in the shape of its handle--and a\r\nrope--emblematical of the punishment deserved by the guilty--were placed\r\non the table before the president. The judges were bareheaded, with bare\r\nhands, and each wore a cloak over his shoulder, and carried no arms of any\r\nsort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328.--The Duke of Saxony and the Marquis of\r\nBrandenburg.--From the \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum sive Tabula veteris\r\nGeographiae,\" in folio. Engraved by Wieriex, after Gérard de Jode.]\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff and the defendant were each allowed to produce thirty\r\nwitnesses. The defendant could either defend himself, or entrust his case\r\nto an advocate whom he brought with him. At first, any free judge being\r\ndefendant in a suit, enjoyed the privilege of justifying himself on oath;\r\nbut it having been discovered that this privilege was abused, all persons,\r\nof whatever station, were compelled to be confronted with the other side.\r\nThe witnesses, who were subpoened by either accuser or accused, had to\r\ngive their evidence according to the truth, dispassionately and\r\nvoluntarily. In the event of the accused not succeeding in bringing\r\nsufficient testimony to clear himself, the prosecutor claimed a verdict in\r\nhis favour from the free count presiding at the tribunal, who appointed\r\none of the free judges to declare it. In case the free judge did not feel\r\nsatisfied as to the guilt, he could, by making oath, temporarily divest\r\nhimself of his office, which devolved upon a second, a third, or even a\r\nfourth free judge. If four free judges were unable to decide, the matter\r\nwas referred to another sitting; for judgment had to be pronounced by the\r\nappointed free judge at the sitting.\r\n\r\nThe various penalties for different crimes were left to the decision of\r\nthe tribunal. The rules are silent on the subject, and simply state that\r\nthe culprits will be punished \"according to the authority of the secret\r\nbench.\" The _royale, i.e._ capital punishment, was strictly applied in all\r\nserious cases, and the manner of execution most in use was hanging (Figs.\r\n329, 330).\r\n\r\nA person accused who did not appear after the third summons, was out-lawed\r\nby a terrible sentence, which deprived him of all rights, of common peace,\r\nand forbad him the company of all Christians; by the wording of this\r\nsentence, his wife was looked upon as a widow, his children as orphans;\r\nhis neck was abandoned to the birds of the air, and his body to the beasts\r\nof the field, \"but his soul was recommended to God.\" At the expiration of\r\none year and a day, if the culprit had not appeared, or had not\r\nestablished his common rights, all his goods were confiscated, and\r\nappropriated by the King or Emperor. When the condemnation referred to a\r\nprince, a town, or a corporation (for the accusations of the tribunal\r\nfrequently were issued against groups of individuals), it caused the loss\r\nof all honour, authority, and privileges. The free count, in pronouncing\r\nthe sentence, threw the rope, which was before him, on to the ground; the\r\nfree judges spat upon it, and the name of the culprit was inscribed on the\r\nbook of blood. The sentence was kept secret; the prosecutor alone was\r\ninformed of it by a written notice, which was sealed with seven seals.\r\nWhen the condemned was present, the execution took place immediately, and,\r\naccording to the custom of the Middle Ages, its carrying out was deputed\r\nto the youngest of the free judges. The members of the Vehmic association\r\nenjoyed the privilege of being hung seven feet higher than those who were\r\nnot associates.\r\n\r\nThe Vehmic judgments were, however, liable to be appealed against: the\r\naccused might, at the sitting, appeal either to what was termed the\r\nimperial chamber, a general chapter of the association, which assembled at\r\nDortmund, or (and this was the more frequent custom) to the emperor, or\r\nruler of the country, whether he were king, prince, duke, or bishop,\r\nprovided that these authorities belonged to the association. The revision\r\nof the judgment could only be entrusted to members of the tribunal, who,\r\nin their turn, could only act in Westphalia. The condemned might also\r\nappeal to the lieutenant-general of the emperor, or to the grand master of\r\nthe Holy Vehme, a title which, from the remotest times, was given to the\r\nArchbishop of Cologne. There are even instances of appeals having been\r\nmade to the councils and to the Popes, although the Vehmic association\r\nnever had any communication or intercourse with the court of Rome. We must\r\nnot forget a very curious privilege which, in certain cases, was left to\r\nthe culprit as a last resource; he might appeal to the emperor, and\r\nsolicit an order which required the execution of the sentence to be\r\napplied after a delay _of one hundred years, six weeks, and one day_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 329 and 330.--Execution of the Sentences of the\r\nSecret Tribunal.--Fac-simile of Woodcuts in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\"\r\nof Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nThe chapter-general of the association was generally summoned once a year\r\nby the emperor or his lieutenant, and assembled either at Dortmund or\r\nArensberg, in order to receive the returns of causes judged by the various\r\nVehmic tribunals; to hear the changes which had taken place among the\r\nmembers of the order; to receive the free judges; to hear appeals; and,\r\nlastly, to decide upon reforms to be introduced into the rules. These\r\nreforms usually had reference to the connection of imperial authority with\r\nthe members of the secret jurisdiction, and were generally suggested by\r\nthe emperors, who were jealous of the increasing power of the association.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have shown, on the authority of authentic documents, we\r\nunderstand how untrue is the tradition, or rather the popular idea, that\r\nthe _Secret Tribunal_ was an assembly of bloodthirsty judges, secretly\r\nperpetrating acts of mere cruelty, without any but arbitrary laws. It is\r\nclear, on the contrary, that it was a regular institution, having, it is\r\ntrue, a most mysterious and complex organization, but simply acting in\r\nvirtue of legal prescriptions, which were rigorously laid down, and\r\narranged in a sort of code which did honour to the wisdom of those who had\r\ncreated it.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth centuries that the Vehmic jurisdiction reached its highest\r\ndegree of power; its name was only pronounced in a whisper and with\r\ntrembling; its orders were received with immediate submission, and its\r\nchastisements always fell upon the guilty and those who resisted its\r\nauthority. There cannot be a doubt but that the Westphalian tribunal\r\nprevented many great crimes and public misfortunes by putting a wholesome\r\ncheck on the nobles, who were ever ready to place themselves above all\r\nhuman authority; and by punishing, with pitiless severity, the audacity of\r\nbandits, who would otherwise have been encouraged to commit the most\r\ndaring acts with almost the certainty of escaping with impunity. But the\r\nHoly Vehme, blinded by the terror it inspired, was not long without\r\ndisplaying the most extravagant assumption of power, and digressing from\r\nthe strict path to which its action should have been confined. It summoned\r\nbefore its tribunals princes, who openly denied its authority, and cities,\r\nwhich did not condescend to answer to its behests. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the free judges were composed of men who could not be called of\r\nunimpeachable integrity; many persons of doubtful morals having been\r\nraised to the dignity by party influence and by money. The partiality and\r\nthe spirit of revenge which at times prompted their judgments, were\r\ncomplained of; they were accused of being open to corruption; and this\r\naccusation appears to have been but too well founded. It is known that,\r\naccording to a feudal practice established in the Vehmic system, every\r\nnew free judge was obliged to make a present to the free count who had\r\nadmitted him into the order; and the free counts did not hesitate to make\r\nthis an important source of revenue to themselves by admitting, according\r\nto an historian, \"many people as _judges_ who, in reality, deserved to be\r\n_judged_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331.--View of Cologne in the Sixteenth Century.--From\r\na Copper-plate in the \"Theatrum Geographicum\" of P. Bertius. The three\r\nlarge stars represent, it is supposed, the Three Persons of the Trinity,\r\nand the seven small ones the Electors of the Empire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332.--German Knights (Fifteenth Century).--From a\r\nPlate in the \"Life of the Emperor Maximilian,\" engraved by Burgmayer, from\r\nDrawings by Albert Durer.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the most flagrant and most insolent abuses of power, the ancient\r\nauthority of the institution became gradually more and more shaken. On one\r\noccasion, for instance, in answer to a summons issued by the Imperial\r\nTribunal against some free judges, the tribunal of the Terre-Rouge had the\r\ndaring to summon the Emperor Frederick III. before it to answer for this\r\nwant of respect. On another occasion, a certain free count, jealous of one\r\nof his associates, hung him with his own hands while out on a hunting\r\nexcursion, alleging that his rank of free judge authorised him to execute\r\nsummary justice. From that time there was a perpetual cry of horror and\r\nindignation against a judicial institution which thus interpreted its\r\nduties, and before long the State undertook the suppression of these\r\nsecret tribunals. The first idea of this was formed by the electors of the\r\nempire at the diet of Trèves in 1512. The Archbishop of Cologne succeeded,\r\nhowever, in parrying the blow, by convoking the chapter-general of the\r\norder, on the plea of the necessity of reform. But, besides being\r\nessentially corrupt, the Holy Vehme had really run its course, and it\r\ngradually became effete as, by degrees, a better organized and more\r\ndefined social and political state succeeded to the confused anarchy of\r\nthe Middle Ages, and as the princes and free towns adopted the custom of\r\ndispensing justice either in person or through regular tribunals. Its\r\nproceedings, becoming more and more summary and rigorous, daily gave rise\r\nto feelings of greater and greater abhorrence. The common saying over all\r\nGermany was, \"They first hang you, and afterwards inquire into your\r\ninnocence.\" On all sides opposition arose against the jurisdiction of the\r\nfree judges. Princes, bishops, cities, and citizens, agreed instinctively\r\nto counteract this worn-out and degenerate institution. The struggle was\r\nlong and tedious. During the last convulsions of the expiring Holy Vehme,\r\nthere was more than one sanguinary episode, both on the side of the free\r\njudges themselves, as well as on that of their adversaries. Occasionally\r\nthe secret tribunal broke out into fresh signs of life, and proclaimed its\r\nexistence by some terrible execution; and at times, also, its members paid\r\ndearly for their acts. On one occasion, in 1570, fourteen free judges,\r\nwhom Kaspar Schwitz, Count of Oettingen, caused to be seized, were already\r\ntied up in bags, and about to be drowned, when the mob, pitying their\r\nfate, asked for and obtained their reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe death-blow to the Vehmic tribunal was struck by its own hand. It\r\ncondenmed summarily, and executed without regular procedure, an inhabitant\r\nof Munster, who used to scandalize the town by his profligacy. He was\r\narrested at night, led to a small wood, where the free judges awaited him,\r\nand condemned to death without being allowed an advocate; and, after being\r\nrefused a respite even of a few hours, that he might make his peace with\r\nheaven, he was confessed by a monk, and his head was severed from his\r\nbody by the executioner on the spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333.--Interior Court of the Palace of the Doges of\r\nVenice: Buildings in which are the Cells and _the Leads_.--From Cesare\r\nVecellio.]\r\n\r\nDating from this tragical event, which excited universal indignation, the\r\nauthority of the free judges gradually declined, and, at last, the\r\ninstitution became almost defunct, and merely confined itself to\r\noccasionally adjudicating in simple civil matters.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention the Council of Ten of Venice when speaking on\r\nthe subject of arbitrary executions and of tyrannical and implacable\r\njustice. In some respects it was more notorious than the Vehmic tribunal,\r\nexercising as it did a no less mysterious power, and inspiring equal\r\nterror, though in other countries.\r\n\r\nThis secret tribunal was created after a revolt which burst on the\r\nrepublic of Venice on the 15th of June, 1310. At first it was only\r\ninstituted for two months, but, after various successive prorogations, it\r\nwas confirmed for five years, on the 31st of January, 1311. In 1316 it was\r\nagain appointed for five years; on the 2nd of May, 1327, for ten years\r\nmore; and at last was established permanently. In the fifteenth century\r\nthe authority of the Council of Ten was consolidated and rendered more\r\nenergetic by the creation of the Inquisitors of State. These were three in\r\nnumber, elected by the Council of Ten; and the citizens on whom the votes\r\nfell could not refuse the functions which were thus spontaneously, and\r\noften unexpectedly, assigned to them. The authority of Inquisitors of\r\nState was declared to be \"unlimited.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to show the power and mode of action of this terrible tribunal,\r\nit is perhaps better to make a few extracts from the code of rules which\r\nit established for itself in June, 1454.\r\n\r\nThis document--several manuscript copies of which are to be found in the\r\npublic libraries of Paris--says, \"The inquisitors may proceed against any\r\nperson whomsoever, no rank giving the right of exemption from their\r\njurisdiction. They may pronounce any sentence, even that of death; only\r\ntheir final sentences must be passed unanimously. They shall have complete\r\ncharge of the prisons and _the leads_ (Fig. 333). They may draw at sight\r\nfrom the treasury of the Council of Ten, without having to give any\r\naccount of the use made of the funds placed in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"The proceedings of the tribunal shall always be secret; its members shall\r\nwear no distinctive badge. No open arrests shall be made. The chief of the\r\nbailiffs (_sbirri_) shall avoid making domiciliary arrests, but he shall\r\ntry to seize the culprit unawares, away from his home, and so securely get\r\nhim under _the leads_ of the Palace of the Doges. When the tribunal shall\r\ndeem the death of any person necessary, the execution shall never be\r\npublic; the condemned shall be drowned at night in the Orfano Canal.\r\n\r\n\"The tribunal shall authorise the generals commanding in Cyprus or in\r\nCandia, in the event of its being for the welfare of the Republic, to\r\ncause any patrician or other influential person in either of those\r\nVenetian provinces to disappear, or to be assassinated secretly, if such a\r\nmeasure should conscientiously appear to them indispensable; but they\r\nshall be answerable before God for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334.--Member of the Brotherhood of Death, whose duty\r\nit was to accompany those sentenced to death.--From Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\n\"If any workman shall practise in a foreign land any art or craft to the\r\ndetriment of the Republic, he shall be ordered to return to his country;\r\nand should he not obey, all his nearest relatives shall be imprisoned, in\r\norder that his affection for them may bring him to obedience. Should he\r\nstill persist in his disobedience, secret measures shall be taken to put\r\nhim to death, wherever he may be.\r\n\r\n\"If a Venetian noble reveal to the tribunal propositions which have been\r\nmade to him by some foreign ambassador, the agent, excepting it should be\r\nthe ambassador himself, shall be immediately carried off and drowned.\r\n\r\n\"If a patrician having committed any misdeed shall take refuge under the\r\nprotection of a foreign ambassador, he shall be put to death forthwith.\r\n\r\n\"If any noble in full senate take upon himself to question the authority\r\nof the Council of Ten, and persist in attacking it, he shall be allowed to\r\nspeak without interruption; immediately afterwards he shall be arrested,\r\nand instructions as to his trial shall be given, so that he may be judged\r\nby the ordinary tribunals; and, if this does not succeed in preventing his\r\nproceedings, he shall be put to death secretly.\r\n\r\n\"In case of a complaint against one of the heads of the Council of Ten,\r\nthe instructions shall be made secretly, and, in case of sentence of\r\ndeath, poison shall be the agent selected.\r\n\r\n\"Should any dissatisfied noble speak ill of the Government, he shall first\r\nbe forbidden to appear in the councils and public places for two years.\r\nShould he not obey, or should he repeat the offence after the two years,\r\nhe shall be drowned as incorrigible....\" &c.\r\n\r\nOne can easily understand that in order to carry out these laws the most\r\ncareful measures were taken to organize a system of espionage. The nobles\r\nwere subjected to a rigorous supervision; the privacy of letters was not\r\nrespected; an ambassador was never lost sight of, and his smallest acts\r\nwere narrowly watched. Any one who dared to throw obstacles in the way of\r\nthe spies employed by the Council of Ten, was put on the rack, and \"made\r\nafterwards to receive the punishment which the State inquisitors might\r\nconsider befitting.\" Whole pages of the secret statutes bear witness that\r\nlying and fraud formed the basis of all the diplomatic relations of the\r\nVenetian Government. Nevertheless the Council of Ten, which was solely\r\ninstituted with the view of watching over the safety of the Republic,\r\ncould not inter-meddle in civil cases, and its members were forbidden to\r\nhold any sort of communication with foreigners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 335 and 336.--Chiefs of Sbirri, in the Secret\r\nService of the Council of Ten.--From Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\nThe list of names of Venetian nobles and distinguished persons who became\r\nvictims to the suspicions tyranny of the Council of Ten, and of the State\r\ninquisitors, would be very long and of little interest. We may mention a\r\nfew, however. We find that in 1385, Peter Justiniani, and, in 1388,\r\nStephen Monalesco, were punished for holding secret transactions with the\r\nLord of Padua; in 1413, John Nogarola, for having tried to set fire to\r\nVerona; in 1471, Borromeo Memo, for having uttered defamatory speeches\r\nagainst the Podestat of Padua. Not only was this Borromeo Memo punished,\r\nbut three witnesses of the crime which was imputed to him were condemned\r\nto a year's imprisonment and three years' banishment, for not having\r\ndenounced the deed \"between evening and morning.\" In 1457 we find the\r\nCouncil of Ten attacking the Doge himself, by requiring the abdication of\r\nFrancis Foscari. A century earlier it had caused the Doge, Marino Faliero,\r\nwho was convicted of having taken part in a plot to destroy the influence\r\nof the nobility, to be executed on the very staircase of the ducal palace,\r\nwhere allegiance to the Republic was usually sworn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.--Doge of Venice. Costume before the Sixteenth\r\nCentury. From Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 338.--Doge of Venice in Ceremonial Costume of the\r\nSixteenth Century. From Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\nLike the Holy Vehme, the Council of Ten compromised its authority by the\r\nabuse of power. In 1540, unknown to the Senate, and in spite of the\r\nwell-prescribed limit of its authority, it concluded a treaty with the\r\nTurkish Sultan, Soliman II. The Senate at first concealed its indignation\r\nat this abuse of power, but, in 1582, it took measures so as considerably\r\nto restrain the powers of the Council of Ten, which, from that date, only\r\nexisted in name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339.--Seal of the Free Count Heinrich Beckmann, of\r\nMedebach.

It is, in fact, difficult to realise the amount of ingenuity\r\nexercised by men in inventing new tortures, in order to give themselves\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing their fellow-creatures agonizing in the most\r\nawful sufferings.\"\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the subject of ancient modes of punishment, we must first\r\nspeak of the torture, which, according to the received phrase, might be\r\neither _previous_ or _preparatory: previous_, when it consisted of a\r\ntorture which the condemned had to endure previous to capital punishment;\r\nand _preparatory_, when it was applied in order to elicit from the culprit\r\nan avowal of his crime, or of that of his accomplices. It was also called\r\n_ordinary_, or _extraordinary_, according to the duration or violence with\r\nwhich it was inflicted. In some cases the torture lasted five or six\r\nconsecutive hours; in others, it rarely exceeded an hour. Hippolyte de\r\nMarsillis, the learned and venerable jurisconsult of Bologna, who lived at\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century, mentions fourteen ways of\r\ninflicting torture. The compression of the limbs by special instruments,\r\nor by ropes only; injection of water, vinegar, or oil, into the body of\r\nthe accused; application of hot pitch, and starvation, were the processes\r\nmost in use. Other means, which were more or less applied according to the\r\nfancy of the magistrate and the tormentor or executioner, were remarkable\r\nfor their singular atrocities. For instance, placing hot eggs under the\r\narm-pits; introducing dice between the skin and flesh; tying lighted\r\ncandles to the fingers, so that they might be consumed simultaneously with\r\nthe wax; letting water trickle drop by drop from a great height on the\r\nstomach; and also the custom, which was, according to writers on criminal\r\nmatters, an indescribable torture, of watering the feet with salt water\r\nand allowing goats to lick them. However, every country had special\r\ncustoms as to the manner of applying torture.\r\n\r\nIn France, too, the torture varied according to the provinces, or rather\r\naccording to the parliaments. For instance, in Brittany the culprit, tied\r\nin an iron chair, was gradually brought near a blazing furnace. In\r\nNormandy, one thumb was squeezed in a screw in the ordinary, and both\r\nthumbs in the extraordinary torture. At Autun, after high boots made of\r\nspongy leather had been placed on the culprit's feet, he was tied on to a\r\ntable near a large fire, and a quantity of boiling water was poured on the\r\nboots, which penetrated the leather, ate away the flesh, and even\r\ndissolved the bones of the victim.\r\n\r\nAt Orleans, for the ordinary torture the accused was stripped half naked,\r\nand his hands were tightly tied behind his back, with a ring fixed between\r\nthem. Then by means of a rope fastened to this ring, they raised the poor\r\nman, who had a weight of one hundred and eighty pounds attached to his\r\nfeet, a certain height from the ground. For the extraordinary torture,\r\nwhich then took the name of _estrapade_, they raised the victim, with two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds attached to his feet, to the ceiling by means of\r\na capstan; he was then allowed to fall several times successively by jerks\r\nto the level of the ground, by which means his arms and legs were\r\ncompletely dislocated (Fig. 340).\r\n\r\nAt Avignon, the ordinary torture consisted in hanging the accused by the\r\nwrists, with a heavy iron ball at each foot; for the extraordinary\r\ntorture, which was then much in use in Italy under the name of _veglia_,\r\nthe body was stretched horizontally by means of ropes passing through\r\nrings riveted into the wall, and attached to the four limbs, the only\r\nsupport given to the culprit being the point of a stake cut in a diamond\r\nshape, which just touched the end of the back-bone. A doctor and a surgeon\r\nwere always present, feeling the pulse at the temples of the patient, so\r\nas to be able to judge of the moment when he could not any longer bear the\r\npain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340.--The Estrapade, or Question\r\nExtraordinary.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the Work of J. Millaeus,\r\n\"Praxis Criminis Persequendi.\" folio, Paris, 1541.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341.--The Water Torture.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\nJ. Damhoudère's \"Praxis Rerum Criminalium:\" in 4to, Antwerp, 1556.]\r\n\r\nAt that moment he was untied, hot fomentations were used to revive him,\r\nrestoratives were administered, and, as soon as he had recovered a little\r\nstrength, he was again put to the torture, which went on thus for six\r\nconsecutive hours.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, for a long time, the _water torture_ was in use; this was the\r\nmost easily borne, and the least dangerous. A person undergoing it was\r\ntied to a board which was supported horizontally on two trestles. By means\r\nof a horn, acting as a funnel, and whilst his nose was being pinched, so\r\nas to force him to swallow, they slowly poured four _coquemars_ (about\r\nnine pints) of water into his mouth; this was for the ordinary torture.\r\nFor the extraordinary, double that quantity was poured in (Fig. 341). When\r\nthe torture was ended, the victim was untied, \"and taken to be warmed in\r\nthe kitchen,\" says the old text.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, the _brodequins_ were preferred. For this torture, the\r\nvictim was placed in a sitting posture on a massive bench, with strong\r\nnarrow boards fixed inside and outside of each leg, which were tightly\r\nbound together with strong rope; wedges were then driven in between the\r\ncentre boards with a mallet; four wedges in the ordinary and eight in the\r\nextraordinary torture. Not unfrequently during the latter operation the\r\nbones of the legs were literally burst.\r\n\r\nThe _brodequins_ which were often used for ordinary torture were stockings\r\nof parchment, into which it was easy enough to get the feet when it was\r\nwet, but which, on being held near the fire, shrunk so considerably that\r\nit caused insufferable agony to the wearer.\r\n\r\nWhatever manner of torture was applied, the accused, before undergoing it,\r\nwas forced to remain eight or ten hours without eating. Damhoudère, in his\r\nfamous technical work, called \"Practique et Enchiridion des Causes\r\nCriminelles\" (1544), also recommends that the hair should be carefully\r\nshaved from the bodies of persons about to undergo examination by torture,\r\nfor fear of their concealing some countercharm which would render them\r\ninsensible to bodily pain. The same author also recommends, as a rule,\r\nwhen there are several persons \"to be placed on the rack\" for the same\r\ndeed, to begin with those from whom it would be most probable that\r\nconfession would be first extorted. Thus, for instance, when a man and a\r\nwoman were to suffer one after the other, he recommended that the woman be\r\nfirst tortured, as being the weaker of the two; when a father and son were\r\nconcerned, the son should be tortured in presence of the father, \"who\r\nnaturally fears more for his son than for himself.\" We thereby see that\r\nthe judges were adepts in the art of adding moral to physical tortures.\r\nThe barbarous custom of punishment by torture was on several occasions\r\ncondemned by the Church. As early as 866, we find, from Pope Nicholas V.'s\r\nletter to the Bulgarians, that their custom of torturing the accused was\r\nconsidered contrary to divine as well as to human law: \"For,\" says he, \"a\r\nconfession should be voluntary, and not forced. By means of the torture,\r\nan innocent man may suffer to the utmost without making any avowal; and,\r\nin such a case, what a crime for the judge! Or the person may be subdued\r\nby pain, and may acknowledge himself guilty, although he be not so, which\r\nthrows an equally great sin upon the judge.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342.--Type of Executioner in the Decapitation of John\r\nthe Baptist (Thirteenth Century).--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the\r\nPsalm-book of St. Louis. Manuscript preserved in the Musée des\r\nSouverains.]\r\n\r\nAfter having endured the _previous_ torture, the different phases of which\r\nwere carried out by special tormentors or executioners, the condemned was\r\nat last handed over to the _maistre des haultes oeuvres_--that is to say,\r\nthe _executioner_--whose special mission was that of sending culprits to\r\nanother world (Fig. 342).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343.--Swiss Grand Provost (Fifteenth Century).--From a\r\nPainting in the \"Danse des Morts\" of Basle, engraved by Mérian.]\r\n\r\nThe executioner did not hold the same position in all countries. For\r\nwhereas in France, Italy, and Spain, a certain amount of odium was\r\nattached to this terrible craft, in Germany, on the contrary, successfully\r\ncarrying out a certain number of capital sentences was rewarded by titles\r\nand the privileges of nobility (Fig. 343). At Reutlingen, in Suabia, the\r\nlast of the councillors admitted into the tribunal had to carry out the\r\nsentence with his own hand. In Franconia, this painful duty fell upon the\r\ncouncillor who had last taken a wife.\r\n\r\nIn France, the executioner, otherwise called the _King's Sworn Tormentor,_\r\nwas the lowest of the officers of justice. His letters of appointment,\r\nwhich he received from the King, had, nevertheless, to be registered in\r\nParliament; but, after having put the seal on them, it is said that the\r\nchancellor threw them under the table, in token of contempt. The\r\nexecutioner was generally forbidden to live within the precincts of the\r\ncity, unless it was on the grounds where the pillory was situated; and, in\r\nsome cases, so that he might not be mistaken amongst the people, he was\r\nforced to wear a particular coat, either of red or yellow. On the other\r\nhand, his duties ensured him certain privileges. In Paris, he possessed\r\nthe right of _havage_, which consisted in taking all that he could hold in\r\nhis hand from every load of grain which was brought into market; however,\r\nin order that the grain might be preserved from ignominious contact, he\r\nlevied his tax with a wooden spoon. He enjoyed many similar rights over\r\nmost articles of consumption, independently of benefiting by several taxes\r\nor fines, such as the toll on the Petit-Pont, the tax on foreign traders,\r\non boats arriving with fish, on dealers in herrings, watercress, &c.; and\r\nthe fine of five sous which was levied on stray pigs (see previous\r\nchapter), &c. And, lastly, besides the personal property of the condemned,\r\nhe received the rents from the shops and stalls surrounding the pillory,\r\nin which the retail fish trade was carried on.\r\n\r\nIt appears that, in consequence of the receipts from these various duties\r\nforming a considerable source of revenue, the prestige of wealth by\r\ndegrees dissipated the unfavourable impressions traditionally attached to\r\nthe duties of executioner. At least, we have authority for supposing this,\r\nwhen, for instance, in 1418, we see the Paris executioner, who was then\r\ncaptain of the bourgeois militia, coming in that capacity to touch the\r\nhand of the Duke of Burgundy, on the occasion of his solemn entry into\r\nParis with Queen Isabel of Bavaria. We may add that popular belief\r\ngenerally ascribed to the executioner a certain practical knowledge of\r\nmedicine, which was supposed inherent in the profession itself; and the\r\nacquaintance with certain methods of cure unknown to doctors, was\r\nattributed to him; people went to buy from him the fat of culprits who had\r\nbeen hung, which was supposed to be a marvellous panacea. We may also\r\nremark that, in our day, the proficiency of the executioner in setting\r\ndislocated limbs is still proverbial in many countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344.--Amende Honorable before the\r\nTribunal.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in J. Damhoudère's \"Praxis Rerum\r\nCriminalium:\" in 4to, Antwerp, 1556.]\r\n\r\nMore than once during the thirteenth century the duties of the executioner\r\nwere performed by women, but only in those cases in which their own sex\r\nwas concerned; for it is expressly stated in an order of St. Louis, that\r\npersons convicted of blasphemy shall be beaten with birch rods, \"the men\r\nby men, and the women by women only, without the presence of men.\" This,\r\nhowever, was not long tolerated, for we know that a period soon arrived\r\nwhen women were exempted from a duty so little adapted to their physical\r\nweakness and moral sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe learned writer on criminal cases, Josse Damhoudère, whom we have\r\nalready mentioned, and whom we shall take as our special guide in the\r\nenumeration of the various tortures, specifies thirteen ways in which the\r\nexecutioner \"carries out his executions,\" and places them in the following\r\norder:--\"Fire\"--\"the sword\"--\"mechanical force\"--\"quartering\"--\"the\r\nwheel\"--\"the fork\"--\"the gibbet\"--\"drawing\"--\"spiking\"--\"cutting off the\r\nears\"--\"dismembering\"--\"flogging or beating\"--and the \"pillory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345.--The Punishment by Fire.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut\r\nof the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nBut before entering upon the details of this revolting subject, we must\r\nstate that, whatever punishment was inflicted upon a culprit, it was very\r\nrare that its execution had not been preceded by the _amende honorable_,\r\nwhich, in certain cases, constituted a distinct punishment, but which\r\ngenerally was but the prelude to the torture itself. The _amende\r\nhonorable_ which was called _simple_ or _short_, took place without the\r\nassistance of the executioner in the council chamber, where the condemned,\r\nbareheaded and kneeling, had to state that \"he had falsely said or done\r\nsomething against the authority of the King or the honour of some person\"\r\n(Fig. 344). For the _amende honorable in figuris_--that is to say, in\r\npublic--the condemned, in his shirt, barefooted, the rope round his neck,\r\nfollowed by the executioner, and holding in his hand a wax taper, with a\r\nweight, which was definitely specified in the sentence which had been\r\npassed upon him, but which was generally of two or four pounds,\r\nprostrated himself at the door of a church, where in a loud voice he had\r\nto confess his sin, and to beg the pardon of God and man.\r\n\r\nWhen a criminal had been condemned to be burnt, a stake was erected on the\r\nspot specially designed for the execution, and round it a pile was\r\nprepared, composed of alternate layers of straw and wood, and rising to\r\nabout the height of a man. Care was taken to leave a free space round the\r\nstake for the victim, and also a passage by which to lead him to it.\r\nHaving been stripped of his clothes, and dressed in a shirt smeared with\r\nsulphur, he had to walk to the centre of the pile through a narrow\r\nopening, and was then tightly bound to the stake with ropes and chains.\r\nAfter this, faggots and straw were thrown into the empty space through\r\nwhich he had passed to the stake, until he was entirely covered by them;\r\nthe pile was then fired on all sides at once (Fig. 345).\r\n\r\nSometimes, the sentence was that the culprit should only be delivered to\r\nthe flames after having been previously strangled. In this case, the dead\r\ncorpse was then immediately placed where the victim would otherwise have\r\nbeen placed alive, and the punishment lost much of its horror. It often\r\nhappened that the executioner, in order to shorten the sufferings of the\r\ncondemned, whilst he prepared the pile, placed a large and pointed iron\r\nbar amongst the faggots and opposite the stake breast high, so that,\r\ndirectly the fire was lighted, the bar was quickly pushed against the\r\nvictim, giving a mortal blow to the unfortunate wretch, who would\r\notherwise have been slowly devoured by the flames. If, according to the\r\nwording of the sentence, the ashes of the criminal were to be scattered to\r\nthe winds, as soon as it was possible to approach the centre of the\r\nburning pile, a few ashes were taken in a shovel and sprinkled in the air.\r\n\r\nThey were not satisfied with burning the living, they also delivered to\r\nthe flames the bodies of those who had died a natural death before their\r\nexecution could be carried out, as if an anticipated death should not be\r\nallowed to save them from the punishment which they had deserved. It also\r\nhappened in certain cases, where a person's guilt was only proved after\r\nhis decease, that his body was disinterred, and carried to the stake to be\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nThe punishment by fire was always inflicted in cases of heresy, or\r\nblasphemy. The Spanish Inquisition made such a constant and cruel use of\r\nit, that the expression _auto-da-fé_ (act of faith), strangely perverted\r\nfrom its original meaning, was the only one employed to denote the\r\npunishment itself. In France, in the beginning of the fourteenth century,\r\nfifty-nine Templars were burned at the same time for the crimes of heresy\r\nand witchcraft. And three years later, on the 18th March, 1314, Jacques\r\nMolay, and a few other dignitaries of the Order of the Templars, also\r\nperished in the flames at the extremity of the island of Notre Dame, on\r\nthe very spot where the equestrian statue of Henry IV. now stands.\r\n\r\nEvery one is acquainted with the fact that judges were found iniquitous\r\nenough to condemn Joan of Arc to death by fire as a witch and a heretic.\r\nHer execution, which took place in the market-place of Rouen, is\r\nremarkable from a circumstance which is little known, and which had never\r\ntaken place on any other occasion. When it was supposed that the fire\r\nwhich surrounded the young heroine on all sides had reached her and no\r\ndoubt suffocated her, although sufficient time had not elapsed for it to\r\nconsume her body, a part of the blazing wood was withdrawn, \"in order to\r\nremove any doubts from the people,\" and when the crowd had satisfied\r\nthemselves by seeing her in the middle of the pile, \"chained to the post\r\nand quite dead, the executioner replaced the fire....\" It should be stated\r\nin reference to this point, that Joan having been accused of witchcraft,\r\nthere was a general belief among the people that the flames would be\r\nharmless to her, and that she would be seen emerging from her pile\r\nunscathed.\r\n\r\nThe sentence of punishment by fire did not absolutely imply death at the\r\nstake, for there was a punishment of this description which was specially\r\nreserved for base coiners, and which consisted in hurling the criminals\r\ninto a cauldron of scalding water or oil.\r\n\r\nWe must include in the category of punishment by fire certain penalties,\r\nwhich were, so to speak, but the preliminaries of a more severe\r\npunishment, such as the sulphur-fire, in which the hands of parricides, or\r\nof criminals accused of high treason, were burned. We must also add\r\nvarious punishments which, if they did not involve death, were none the\r\nless cruel, such as the red-hot brazier, _bassin ardent_, which was passed\r\nbackwards and forwards before the eyes of the culprit, until they were\r\ndestroyed by the scorching heat; and the process of branding various marks\r\non the flesh, as an ineffaceable stigma, the use of which has been\r\ncontinued to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn certain countries decapitation was performed with an axe; but in\r\nFrance, it was carried out usually by means of a two-handed sword or\r\nglave of justice, which was furnished to the executioner for that purpose\r\n(Fig. 346). We find it recorded that in 1476, sixty sous parisis were paid\r\nto the executioner of Paris \"for having bought a large _espée à feuille_,\"\r\nused for beheading the condemned, and \"for having the old sword done up,\r\nwhich was damaged, and had become notched whilst carrying out the sentence\r\nof justice upon Messire Louis de Luxembourg.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346.--Beheading.--Fac-simile of a Miniature on Wood in\r\nthe \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nOriginally, decapitation was indiscriminately inflicted on all criminals\r\ncondemned to death; at a later period, however, it became the particular\r\nprivilege of the nobility, who submitted to it without any feeling of\r\ndegradation. The victim--unless the sentence prescribed that he should be\r\nblindfolded as an ignominious aggravation of the penalty--was allowed to\r\nchoose whether he would have his eyes covered or not. He knelt down on the\r\nscaffold, placed his head on the block, and gave himself up to the\r\nexecutioner (Fig. 347). The skill of the executioner was generally such\r\nthat the head was almost invariably severed from the body at the first\r\nblow. Nevertheless, skill and practice at times failed, for cases are on\r\nrecord where as many as eleven blows were dealt, and at times it happened\r\nthat the sword broke. It was no doubt the desire to avoid this mischance\r\nthat led to the invention of the mechanical instrument, now known under\r\nthe name of the _guillotine_, which is merely an improvement on a\r\ncomplicated machine which was much more ancient than is generally\r\nsupposed. As early as the sixteenth century the modern guillotine already\r\nexisted in Scotland under the name of the _Maiden_, and English historians\r\nrelate that Lord Morton, regent of Scotland during the minority of James\r\nVI., had it constructed after a model of a similar machine, which had long\r\nbeen in use at Halifax, in Yorkshire. They add, and popular tradition also\r\nhas invented an analogous tale in France, that this Lord Morton, who was\r\nthe inventor or the first to introduce this kind of punishment, was\r\nhimself the first to experience it. The guillotine is, besides, very\r\naccurately described in the \"Chronicles of Jean d'Auton,\" in an account of\r\nan execution which took place at Genoa at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Two German engravings, executed about 1550 by Pencz and\r\nAldegrever, also represent an instrument of death almost identical with\r\nthe guillotine; and the same instrument is to be found on a bas-relief of\r\nthat period, which is still existing in one of the halls of the Tribunal\r\nof Luneburg, in Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decapitation of Guillaume de Pommiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347.--Public Executions.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\nthe Latin Work of J. Millaeus, \"Praxis Criminis Persequendi:\" small folio,\r\nParisis, Simon de Colines, 1541.]\r\n\r\nAnd his Confessor, at Bordeaux in 1377, by order of the King of England's\r\nLieutenant. _Froissart's Chronicles._ No. 2644, Bibl. nat'le de Paris.]\r\n\r\nPossibly the invention of such a machine was prompted by the desire to\r\ncurtail the physical sufferings of the victim, instead of prolonging them,\r\nas under the ancient system. It is, however, difficult to believe that the\r\nmediæval judges were actuated by any humane feelings, when we find that,\r\nin order to reconcile a respect for _propriety_ with a due compliance with\r\nthe ends of justice, the punishment of burying alive was resorted to for\r\nwomen, who could not with decency be hung up to the gibbets. In 1460, a\r\nwoman named Perette, accused of theft and of receiving stolen goods, was\r\ncondemned by the Provost of Paris to be \"buried alive before the gallows,\"\r\nand the sentence was literally carried out.\r\n\r\n_Quartering_ may in truth be considered the most horrible penalty invented\r\nby judicial cruelty. This punishment really dates from the remotest ages,\r\nbut it was scarcely ever inflicted in more modern times, except on\r\nregicides, who were looked upon as having committed the worst of crimes.\r\nIn almost all cases, the victim had previously to undergo various\r\naccessory tortures: sometimes his right hand was cut off, and the\r\nmutilated stump was burnt in a cauldron of sulphur; sometimes his arms,\r\nthighs, or breasts were lacerated with red-hot pincers, and hot oil,\r\npitch, or molten lead was poured into the wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348.--Demons applying the Torture of the\r\nWheel.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the \"Grand Kalendrier ou Compost des\r\nBergers:\" small folio, Troyes, Nicholas le Rouge, 1529.]\r\n\r\nAfter these horrible preliminaries, a rope was attached to each of the\r\nlimbs of the criminal, one being bound round each leg from the foot to the\r\nknee, and round each arm from the wrist to the elbow. These ropes were\r\nthen fastened to four bars, to each of which a strong horse was harnessed,\r\nas if for towing a barge. These horses were first made to give short\r\njerks; and when the agony had elicited heart-rending cries from the\r\nunfortunate man, who felt his limbs being dislocated without being broken,\r\nthe four horses were all suddenly urged on with the whip in different\r\ndirections, and thus all the limbs were strained at one moment. If the\r\ntendons and ligaments still resisted the combined efforts of the four\r\nhorses, the executioner assisted, and made several cuts with a hatchet on\r\neach joint. When at last--for this horrible torture often lasted several\r\nhours--each horse had drawn out a limb, they were collected and placed\r\nnear the hideous trunk, which often still showed signs of life, and the\r\nwhole were burned together. Sometimes the sentence was, that the body\r\nshould be hung to the gibbet, and that the limbs should be displayed on\r\nthe gates of the town, or sent to four principal towns in the extremities\r\nof the kingdom. When this was done, \"an inscription was placed on each of\r\nthe limbs, which stated the reason of its being thus exposed.\"\r\n\r\nThe _wheel_ is the name applied to a torture of very ancient origin, but\r\nwhich was applied during the Middle Ages to quite a different torture from\r\nthat used in olden times. The modern instrument might indeed have been\r\ncalled the cross, for it only served for the public exhibition of the body\r\nof the criminal whose limbs had been previously broken alive. This\r\ntorture, which does not date earlier than the days of Francis I., is thus\r\ndescribed:--The victim was first tied on his back to two joists forming a\r\nSt. Andrew's cross, each of his limbs being stretched out on its arms. Two\r\nplaces were hollowed out under each limb, about a foot apart, in order\r\nthat the joints alone might touch the wood. The executioner then dealt a\r\nheavy blow over each hollow with a square iron bar, about two inches broad\r\nand rounded at the handle, thus breaking each limb in two places. To the\r\neight blows required for this, the executioner generally added two or\r\nthree on the chest, which were called _coups de grâce_, and which ended\r\nthis horrible execution. It was only after death that the broken body was\r\nplaced on a wheel, which was turned round on a pivot. Sometimes, however,\r\nthe sentence ordered that the condemned should be strangled before being\r\nbroken, which was done in such cases by the instantaneous twist of a rope\r\nround the neck.\r\n\r\nStrangling, thus carried out, was called _garotting_. This method is still\r\nin use in Spain, and is specially reserved for the nobility. The victim is\r\nseated on a scaffold, his head leaning against a beam and his neck grasped\r\nby an iron collar, which the executioner suddenly tightens from behind by\r\nmeans of a screw.\r\n\r\nFor several centuries, and down to the Revolution, hanging was the most\r\ncommon mode of execution in France; consequently, in every town, and\r\nalmost in every village, there was a permanent gibbet, which, owing to the\r\ncustom of leaving the bodies to hang till they crumbled into dust, was\r\nvery rarely without having some corpses or skeletons attached to it. These\r\ngibbets, which were called _fourches patibulaires_ or _justices_, because\r\nthey represented the authority of the law, were generally composed of\r\npillars of stone, joined at their summit by wooden traverses, to which the\r\nbodies of criminals were tied by ropes or chains. The gallows, the pillars\r\nof which varied in number according to the will of the authorities, were\r\nalways placed by the side of frequented roads, and on an eminence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349.--The Gibbet of Montfaucon.--From an Engraving of\r\nthe Topography of Paris, in the Collection of Engravings of the National\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nAccording to prescribed rule, the gallows of Paris, which played such an\r\nimportant part in the political as well as the criminal history of that\r\ncity, were erected on a height north of the town, near the high road\r\nleading into Germany. Montfaucon, originally the name of the hill, soon\r\nbecame that of the gallows itself. This celebrated place of execution\r\nconsisted of a heavy mass of masonry, composed of ten or twelve layers of\r\nrough stones, and formed an enclosure of forty feet by twenty-five or\r\nthirty. At the upper part there was a platform, which was reached by a\r\nstone staircase, the entrance to which was closed by a massive door (Fig.\r\n349). On three sides of this platform rested sixteen square pillars, about\r\nthirty feet high, made of blocks of stone a foot thick. These pillars were\r\njoined to one another by double bars of wood, which were fastened into\r\nthem, and bore iron chains three feet and a half long, to which the\r\ncriminals were suspended. Underneath, half-way between these and the\r\nplatform, other bars were placed for the same purpose. Long and solid\r\nladders riveted to the pillars enabled the executioner and his assistants\r\nto lead up criminals, or to carry up corpses destined to be hung there.\r\nLastly, the centre of the structure was occupied by a deep pit, the\r\nhideous receptacle of the decaying remains of the criminals.\r\n\r\nOne can easily imagine the strange and melancholy aspect of this\r\nmonumental gibbet if one thinks of the number of corpses continually\r\nattached to it, and which were feasted upon by thousands of crows. On one\r\noccasion only it was necessary to replace _fifty-two_ chains, which were\r\nuseless; and the accounts of the city of Paris prove that the expense of\r\nexecutions was more heavy than that of the maintenance of the gibbet, a\r\nfact easy to be understood if one recalls to mind the frequency of capital\r\nsentences during the Middle Ages. Montfaucon was used not only for\r\nexecutions, but also for exposing corpses which were brought there from\r\nvarious places of execution in every part of the country. The mutilated\r\nremains of criminals who had been boiled, quartered, or beheaded, were\r\nalso hung there, enclosed in sacks of leather or wickerwork. They often\r\nremained hanging for a considerable time, as in the case of Pierre des\r\nEssarts, who had been beheaded in 1413, and whose remains were handed over\r\nto his family for Christian burial after having hung on Montfaucon for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nThe criminal condemned to be hanged was generally taken to the place of\r\nexecution sitting or standing in a waggon, with his back to the horses,\r\nhis confessor by his side, and the executioner behind him. He bore three\r\nropes round his neck; two the size of the little finger, and called\r\n_tortouses_, each of which had a slip-knot; the third, called the _jet_,\r\nwas only used to pull the victim off the ladder, and so to launch him into\r\neternity (Fig. 350). When the cart arrived at the foot of the gallows, the\r\nexecutioner first ascended the ladder backwards, drawing the culprit after\r\nhim by means of the ropes, and forcing him to keep pace with him; on\r\narriving at the top, he quickly fastened the two _tortouses_ to the arm of\r\nthe gibbet, and by a jerk of his knee he turned the culprit off the\r\nladder, still holding the _jet_ in his own hand. He then placed his feet\r\non the tied hands of the condemned, and suspending himself by his hands to\r\nthe gibbet, he finished off his victim by repeated jerks, thus ensuring\r\ncomplete strangulation.\r\n\r\nWhen the words \"shall be hung until death doth ensue\" are to be found in\r\na sentence, it must not be supposed that they were used merely as a form,\r\nfor in certain cases the judge ordered that the sentence should be only\r\ncarried out as far as would prove to the culprit the awful sensation of\r\nhanging. In such cases, the victim was simply suspended by ropes passing\r\nunder the arm-pits, a kind of exhibition which was not free from danger\r\nwhen it was too prolonged, for the weight of the body so tightened the\r\nrope round the chest that the circulation might be stopped. Many culprits,\r\nafter hanging thus an hour, when brought down, were dead, or only survived\r\nthis painful process a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350.--Hanging to Music. (A Minstrel condemned to the\r\nGallows obtained permission that one of his companions should accompany\r\nhim to his execution, and play his favourite instrument on the ladder of\r\nthe Gallows.)--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in Michault's \"Doctrinal du Temps\r\nPrésent:\" small folio, goth., Bruges, about 1490.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen elsewhere (chapter on _Privileges and Rights, Feudal and\r\nMunicipal_) that, when the criminal passed before the convent of the\r\n_Filles-Dieu_, the nuns of that establishment were bound to bring him out\r\na glass of wine and three pieces of bread, and this was called _le dernier\r\nmorceau des patients._ It was hardly ever refused, and an immense crowd\r\nassisted at this sad meal. After this the procession went forward, and on\r\narriving near the gallows, another halt was made at the foot of a stone\r\ncross, in order that the culprit might receive the religions exhortations\r\nof his confessor. The moment the execution was over, the confessor and\r\nthe officers of justice returned to the Châtelet, where a repast provided\r\nby the town awaited them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351.--View of the Pillory in the Market-place of Paris\r\nin the Sixteenth Century, after a Drawing by an unknown Artist of 1670.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the criminals, in consequence of a peculiar wording of the\r\nsentence, were taken to Montfaucon, whether dead or alive, on a ladder\r\nfastened behind a cart. This was an aggravation of the penalty, which was\r\ncalled _traîner sur la claie_.\r\n\r\nThe penalty of the lash was inflicted in two ways: first, under the\r\n_custode_, that is to say within the prison, and by the hand of the gaoler\r\nhimself, in which case it was simply a correction; and secondly, in\r\npublic, when its administration became ignominious as well as painful. In\r\nthe latter case the criminal was paraded about the town, stripped to the\r\nwaist, and at each crossway he received a certain number of blows on the\r\nshoulders, given by the public executioner with a cane or a knotted rope.\r\n\r\nWhen it was only required to stamp a culprit with infamy he was put into\r\nthe _pillory_, which was generally a kind of scaffold furnished with\r\nchains and iron collars, and bearing on its front the arms of the feudal\r\nlord. In Paris, this name was given to a round isolated tower built in the\r\ncentre of the market. The tower was sixty feet high, and had large\r\nopenings in its thick walls, and a horizontal wheel was provided, which\r\nwas capable of turning on a pivot. This wheel was pierced with several\r\nholes, made so as to hold the hands and head of the culprit, who, on\r\npassing and repassing before the eyes of the crowd, came in full view, and\r\nwas subjected to their hootings (Fig. 351). The pillories were always\r\nsituated in the most frequented places, such as markets, crossways, &c.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the long and dreadful enumeration we have just made of\r\nmediæval punishments, we are far from having exhausted the subject; for we\r\nhave not spoken of several more or less atrocious punishments, which were\r\nin use at various times and in various countries; such as the _Pain of the\r\nCross_, specially employed against the Jews; the _Arquebusade_, which was\r\nwell adapted for carrying out prompt justice on soldiers; the\r\n_Chatouillement_, which resulted in death after the most intense tortures;\r\nthe _Pal_ (Fig. 352), _flaying alive_, and, lastly, _drowning_, a kind of\r\ndeath frequently employed in France. Hence the common expression, _gens de\r\nsac et de corde_, which was derived from the sack into which persons were\r\ntied who were condemned to die by immersion.... But we will now turn away\r\nfrom these horrible scenes, and consider the several methods of penal\r\nsequestration and prison arrangements.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to state that in barbarous times the cruel and pitiless\r\nfeeling which induced legislators to increase the horrors of tortures,\r\nalso contributed to the aggravation of the fate of prisoners. Each\r\nadministrator of the law had his private gaol, which was entirely under\r\nhis will and control (Fig. 353). Law or custom did not prescribe any\r\nfixed rules for the internal government of prisons. There can be little\r\ndoubt, however, that these prisons were as small as they were unhealthy,\r\nif we may judge from that in the Rue de la Tannerie, which was the\r\nproperty of the provost, the merchants, and the aldermen of Paris in 1383.\r\nAlthough this dungeon was only eleven feet long by seven feet wide, from\r\nten to twenty prisoners were often immured in it at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352.--Empalement.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the\r\n\"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nParis alone contained twenty-five or thirty special prisons, without\r\ncounting the _vade in pace_ of the various religious communities. The most\r\nimportant were the Grand Châtelet, the Petit Châtelet, the Bastille, the\r\nConciergerie, and the For-l'Evêque, the ancient seat of the ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction of the Bishop of Paris. Nearly all these places of\r\nconfinement contained subterranean cells, which were almost entirely\r\ndeprived of air and light. As examples of these may be mentioned the\r\n_Chartres basses_ of the Petit Châtelet, where, under the reign of Charles\r\nVI., it was proved that no man could pass an entire day without being\r\nsuffocated; and the fearful cells excavated thirty feet below the surface\r\nof the earth, in the gaol of the Abbey of Saint Germain des Prés, the roof\r\nof which was so low that a man of middle height could not stand up in\r\nthem, and where the straw of the prisoners' beds floated upon the stagnant\r\nwater which had oozed through the walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353.--The Provost's Prison.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut\r\nin J. Damhoudère's \"Praxis Rerum Civilium.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Châtelet was one of the most ancient prisons of Paris, and\r\nprobably the one which held the greatest number of prisoners. By a curious\r\nand arbitrary custom, prisoners were compelled to pay a gaol fee on\r\nentering and going out of this prison, which varied according to their\r\nrank, and which was established by a law of the year 1425. We learn from\r\nthis enactment the names by which the various places of confinement\r\ncomposing this spacious municipal prison were known. A prisoner who was\r\nconfined in the _Beauvoir, La Mate_ or _La Salle_, had the right of\r\n\"having a bed brought from his own house,\" and only had to pay the _droit\r\nde place_ to the gaoler; any one who was placed in the _Boucherie_, in the\r\n_Beaumont_, or in the _Griseche_, \"which are closed prisons,\" had to pay\r\nfour deniers \"_pour place_;\" any one who was confined in the _Beauvais_,\r\n\"lies on mats or on layers of rushes or straw\" (_gist sur nates ou sur\r\ncouche de feurre ou de paille_); if he preferred, he might be placed _au\r\nPuis_, in the _Gourdaine_, in the _Bercueil_, or in the _Oubliette_, where\r\nhe did not pay more than in the _Fosse_. For this, no doubt, the smallest\r\ncharge was made. Sometimes, however, the prisoner was left between two\r\ndoors (\"_entre deux huis_\"), and he then paid much less than he would in\r\nthe _Barbarie_ or in the _Gloriette_. The exact meaning of these curious\r\nnames is no longer intelligible to us, notwithstanding the terror which\r\nthey formerly created, but their very strangeness gives us reason to\r\nsuppose that the prison system was at that time subjected to the most\r\nodious refinement of the basest cruelty.\r\n\r\nFrom various reliable sources we learn that there was a place in the Grand\r\nChâtelet, called the _Chausse d'Hypocras_, in which the prisoners had\r\ntheir feet continually in water, and where they could neither stand up nor\r\nlie down; and a cell, called _Fin d'aise_, which was a horrible receptacle\r\nof filth, vermin, and reptiles; as to the _Fosse_, no staircase being\r\nattached to it, the prisoners were lowered down into it by means of a rope\r\nand pulley.\r\n\r\nBy the law of 1425, the gaoler was not permitted to put more than _two or\r\nthree_ persons in the same bed. He was bound to give \"bread and water\" to\r\nthe poor prisoners who had no means of subsistence; and, lastly, he was\r\nenjoined \"to keep the large stone basin, which was on the pavement, full\r\nof water, so that prisoners might get it whenever they wished.\" In order\r\nto defray his expenses, he levied on the prisoners various charges for\r\nattendance and for bedding, and he was authorised to detain in prison any\r\nperson who failed to pay him. The power of compelling payment of these\r\ncharges continued even after a judge's order for the release of a prisoner\r\nhad been issued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354.--The Bastille.--From an ancient Engraving of the\r\nTopography of Paris, in the Collection of Engravings of the National\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nThe subterranean cells of the Bastille (Fig. 354) did not differ much from\r\nthose of the Châtelet. There were several, the bottoms of which were\r\nformed like a sugar-loaf upside down, thus neither allowing the prisoner\r\nto stand up, nor even to adopt a tolerable position sitting or lying down.\r\nIt was in these that King Louis XI., who seemed to have a partiality for\r\nfilthy dungeons, placed the two young sons of the Duke de Nemours\r\n(beheaded in 1477), ordering, besides, that they should be taken out twice\r\na week and beaten with birch rods, and, as a supreme measure of atrocity,\r\nhe had one of their teeth extracted every three months. It was Louis XI.,\r\ntoo, who, in 1476, ordered the famous _iron cage_, to be erected in one of\r\nthe towers of the Bastille, in which Guillaume, Bishop of Verdun, was\r\nincarcerated for fourteen years.\r\n\r\nThe Château de Loches also possessed one of these cages, which received\r\nthe name of _Cage de Balue_, because the Cardinal Jean de la Balue was\r\nimprisoned in it. Philippe de Commines, in his \"Mémoires,\" declares that\r\nhe himself had a taste of it for eight months. Before the invention of\r\ncages, Louis XI. ordered very heavy chains to be made, which were fastened\r\nto the feet of the prisoners, and attached to large iron balls, called,\r\naccording to Commines, the King's little daughters (_les fillettes du\r\nroy_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355.--Movable Iron Cage.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\nthe \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster, in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nThe prison known by the name of The Leads of Venice is of so notorious a\r\ncharacter that its mere mention is sufficient, without its being necessary\r\nfor us to describe it. To the subject of voluntary seclusions, to which\r\ncertain pious persons submitted themselves as acts of extreme religious\r\ndevotion, it will only be necessary to allude here, and to remark that\r\nthere are examples of this confinement having been ordered by legal\r\nauthority. In 1485, Renée de Vermandois, the widow of a squire, had been\r\ncondemned to be burnt for adultery and for murdering her husband; but, on\r\nletters of remission from the King, Parliament commuted the sentence\r\npronounced by the Provost of Paris, and ordered that Renée de Vermandois\r\nshould be \"shut up within the walls of the cemetery of the\r\nSaints-Innocents, in a small house, built at her expense, that she might\r\ntherein do penance and end her days.\" In conformity with this sentence,\r\nthe culprit having been conducted with much pomp to the cell which had\r\nbeen prepared for her, the door was locked by means of two keys, one of\r\nwhich remained in the hands of the churchwarden (_marguillier_) of the\r\nChurch of the Innocents, and the other was deposited at the office of the\r\nParliament. The prisoner received her food from public charity, and it is\r\nsaid that she became an object of veneration and respect by the whole\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.--Cat-o'-nine-tails.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in\r\nthe \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dispersion of the Jews.--Jewish Quarters in the Mediæval Towns.--The\r\n  _Ghetto_ of Rome.--Ancient Prague.--The _Giudecca_ of Venice.--Condition\r\n  of the Jews.--Animosity of the People against them--Severity and\r\n  vexatious Treatment of the Sovereigns.--The Jews of Lincoln.--The Jews\r\n  of Blois.--Mission of the _Pastoureaux_.--Extermination of the\r\n  Jews.--The Price at which the Jews purchased Indulgences.--Marks set\r\n  upon them.--Wealth, Knowledge, Industry, and Financial Aptitude of the\r\n  Jews.--Regulations respecting Usury as practised by the\r\n  Jews.--Attachment of the Jews to their Religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA painful and gloomy history commences for the Jewish race from the day\r\nwhen the Romans seized upon Jerusalem and expelled its unfortunate\r\ninhabitants, a race so essentially homogeneous, strong, patient, and\r\nreligious, and dating its origin from the remotest period of the\r\npatriarchal ages. The Jews, proud of the title of \"the People of God,\"\r\nwere scattered, proscribed, and received universal reprobation (Fig. 357),\r\nnotwithstanding that their annals, collected under divine inspiration by\r\nMoses and the sacred writers, had furnished a glorious prologue to the\r\nannals of all modern nations, and had given to the world the holy and\r\ndivine history of Christ, who, by establishing the Gospel, was to become\r\nthe regenerator of the whole human family.\r\n\r\nTheir Temple is destroyed, and the crowd which had once pressed beneath\r\nits portico as the flock of the living God has become a miserable tribe,\r\nrestless and unquiet in the present, but full of hope as regards the\r\nfuture. The Jewish _nation_ exists nowhere, nevertheless, the Jewish\r\n_people_ are to be found everywhere. They are wanderers upon the face of\r\nthe earth, continually pursued, threatened, and persecuted. It would seem\r\nas if the existence of the offspring of Israel is perpetuated simply to\r\npresent to Christian eyes a clear and awful warning of the Divine\r\nvengeance, a special, and at the same time an overwhelming example of the\r\nvicissitudes which God alone can determine in the life of a people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.--Expulsion of the Jews in the Reign of the\r\nEmperor Hadrian (A.D. 135): \"How Heraclius turned the Jews out of\r\nJerusalem.\"--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the \"Histoire des Empereurs,\"\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the Library of the Arsenal,\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nM. Depping, an historian of this race so long accursed, after having been\r\nfor centuries blessed and favoured by God, says, \"A Jewish community in an\r\nEuropean town during the Middle Ages resembled a colony on an island or on\r\na distant coast. Isolated from the rest of the population, it generally\r\noccupied a district or street which was separated from the town or\r\nborough. The Jews, like a troop of lepers, were thrust away and huddled\r\ntogether into the most uncomfortable and most unhealthy quarter of the\r\ncity, as miserable as it vas disgusting. There, in ill-constructed houses,\r\nthis poor and numerous population was amassed; in some cases high walls\r\nenclosed the small and dark narrow streets of the quarter occupied by this\r\nbranded race, which prevented its extension, though, at the same time, it\r\noften protected the inhabitants from the fury of the populace.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to form a just appreciation of what the Jewish quarters were like\r\nin the mediæval towns, one must visit the _Ghetto_ of Rome or ancient\r\nPrague. The latter place especially has, in all respects, preserved its\r\nantique appearance. We must picture to ourselves a large enclosure of\r\nwretched houses, irregularly built, divided by small streets with no\r\nattempt at uniformity. The principal thoroughfare is lined with stalls, in\r\nwhich are sold not only old clothes, furniture, and utensils, but also new\r\nand glittering articles. The inhabitants of this enclosure can, without\r\ncrossing its limits, procure everything necessary to material life. This\r\nquarter contains the old synagogue, a square building begrimed with the\r\ndirt of ages, and so covered with dirt and moss that the stone of which it\r\nis built is scarcely visible. The building, which is as mournful as a\r\nprison, has only narrow loopholes by way of windows, and a door so low\r\nthat one must stoop to enter it. A dark passage leads to the interior,\r\ninto which air and light can scarcely penetrate. A few lamps contend with\r\nthe darkness, and lighted fires serve to modify a little the icy\r\ntemperature of this cellar. Here and there pillars seem to support a roof\r\nwhich is too high and too darkened for the eye of the visitor to\r\ndistinguish. On the sides are dark and damp recesses, where women assist\r\nat the celebration of worship, which is always carried on, according to\r\nancient custom, with much wailing and strange gestures of the body. The\r\nbook of the law which is in use is no less venerable than the edifice in\r\nwhich it is contained. It appears that this synagogue has never undergone\r\nthe slightest repairs or changes for many centuries. The successive\r\ngenerations who have prayed in this ancient temple rest under thousands\r\nof sepulchral stones, in a cemetery which is of the same date as the\r\nsynagogue, and is about a league in circumference.\r\n\r\nParis has never possessed, properly speaking, a regular _Jewish quarter_;\r\nit is true that the Israelites settled down in the neighbourhood of the\r\nmarkets, and in certain narrow streets, which at some period or other took\r\nthe name of _Juiverie_ or _Vieille Juiverie (Old Jewry_); but they were\r\nnever distinct from the rest of the population; they only had a separate\r\ncemetery, at the bottom or rather on the slope of the hill of\r\nSainte-Geneviève. On the other hand, most of the towns of France and of\r\nEurope had their _Jewry_. In certain countries, the colonies of Jews\r\nenjoyed a share of immunities and protections, thus rendering their life a\r\nlittle less precarious, and their occupations of a rather more settled\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and in Portugal, the Jews, in consequence of their having been on\r\nseveral occasions useful to the kings of those two countries, were allowed\r\nto carry on their trade, and to engage in money speculations, outside\r\ntheir own quarters; a few were elevated to positions of responsibility,\r\nand some were even tolerated at court.\r\n\r\nIn the southern towns of France, which they enriched by commerce and\r\ntaxes, and where they formed considerable communities, the Jews enjoyed\r\nthe protection of the nobles. We find them in Languedoc and Provence\r\nbuying and selling property like Christians, a privilege which was not\r\npermitted to them elsewhere: this is proved by charters of contracts made\r\nduring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which bear the signature of\r\ncertain Jews in Hebrew characters. On Papal lands, at Avignon, at\r\nCarpentras, and at Cavaillon, they had _bailes_, or consuls of their\r\nnation. The Jews of Rousillon during the Spanish rule (fifteenth century)\r\nwere governed by two syndics and a scribe, elected by the community. The\r\nlatter levied the taxes due to the King of Aragon. In Burgundy they\r\ncultivated the vines, which was rather singular, for the Jews generally\r\npreferred towns where they could form groups more compact, and more\r\ncapable of mutual assistance. The name of _Sabath_, given to a vineyard in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mâcon, still points out the position of their\r\nsynagogue. The hamlet of _Mouys_, a dependency of the communes of Prissey,\r\nowes its name to a rich Israelite, Moses, who had received that land as an\r\nindemnity for money lent to the Count Gerfroy de Mâcon, which the latter\r\nhad been unable to repay. In Vienna, where the Israelites had a special\r\nquarter, still called _the Jews'_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.--Jews taking the Blood from Christian Children,\r\nfor their Mystic Rites.--From a Pen-and-ink Drawing, illuminated, in the\r\nBook of the Cabala of Abraham the Jew (Library of the Arsenal, Paris).]\r\n\r\n_Square_, a special judge named by the duke was set over them. Exempted\r\nfrom the city rates, they paid a special poil tax, and they contributed,\r\nbut on the same footing as Christian vassals, to extraordinary rates, war\r\ntaxes, and travelling expenses of the nobles, &c. This community even\r\nbecame so rich that it eventually held mortgages on the greater part of\r\nthe houses of the town.\r\n\r\nIn Venice also, the Jews had their quarter--the _Giudecca_--which is still\r\none of the darkest in the town; but they did not much care about such\r\ntrifling inconveniences, as the republic allowed them to bank, that is, to\r\nlend money at interest; and although they were driven out on several\r\noccasions, they always found means to return and recommence their\r\noperations. When they were authorised to establish themselves in the towns\r\nof the Adriatic, their presence did not fail to annoy the Christian\r\nmerchants, whose rivals they were; but neither in Venice nor in the\r\nItalian republics had they to fear court intrigues, nor the hatred of\r\ncorporations of trades, which were so powerful in France and in Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was in the north of Europe that the animosity against the Jews was\r\ngreatest. The Christian population continually threatened the Jewish\r\nquarters, which public opinion pointed to as haunts and sinks of iniquity.\r\nThe Jews were believed to be much more amenable to the doctrines of the\r\nTalmud than to the laws of Moses. However secret they may have kept their\r\nlearning, a portion of its tenets transpired, which was supposed to\r\ninculcate the right to pillage and murder Christians; and it is to the\r\nvague knowledge of these odious prescriptions of the Talmud that we must\r\nattribute the readiness with which the most atrocious accusations against\r\nthe Jews were always welcomed.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the public mind in those days of bigotry was naturally\r\nfilled with a deep antipathy against the Jewish deicides. When monks and\r\npriests came annually in Holy week to relate from the pulpit to their\r\nhearers the revolting details of the Passion, resentment was kindled in\r\nthe hearts of the Christians against the descendants of the judges and\r\nexecutioners of the Saviour. And when, on going out of the churches,\r\nexcited by the sermons they had just heard, the faithful saw in pictures,\r\nin the cemeteries, and elsewhere, representations of the mystery of the\r\ndeath of our Saviour, in which the Jews played so odious a part, there was\r\nscarcely a spectator who did not feel an increased hatred against the\r\ncondemned race. Hence it was that in many towns, even when the authorities\r\ndid not compel them to do so, the Israelites found it prudent to shut\r\nthemselves up in their own quarter, and even in their own houses, during\r\nthe whole of Passion week; for, in consequence of the public feeling\r\nroused during those days of mourning and penance, a false rumour was quite\r\nsufficient to give the people a pretext for offering violence to the Jews.\r\n\r\nIn fact, from the earliest days of Christianity, a certain number of\r\naccusations were always being made, sometimes in one country, sometimes in\r\nanother, against the Israelites, which always ended in bringing down the\r\nsame misfortunes on their heads. The most common, and most easily credited\r\nreport, was that which attributed to them the murder of some Christian\r\nchild, said to be sacrificed in Passion week in token of their hatred of\r\nChrist; and in the event of this terrible accusation being once uttered,\r\nand maintained by popular opinion, it never failed to spread with\r\nremarkable swiftness. In such cases, popular fury, not being on all\r\noccasions satisfied with the tardiness of judicial forms, vented itself\r\nupon the first Jews who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of their\r\nenemies. As soon as the disturbance was heard the Jewish quarter was\r\nclosed; fathers and mothers barricaded themselves in with their children,\r\nconcealed whatever riches they possessed, and listened tremblingly to the\r\nclamour of the multitude which was about to besiege them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359.--Secret Meeting of the Jews at the Rabbi's\r\nHouse.--Fac-simile of a Miniature of the \"Pèlerinage de la Vie Humaine,\"\r\nManuscript of the Fourteenth Century, in the National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nIn 1255, in Lincoln, the report was suddenly spread that a child of the\r\nname of Hughes had been enticed into the Jewish quarter, and there\r\nscourged, crucified, and pierced with lances, in the presence of all the\r\nIsraelites of the district, who were convoked and assembled to take part\r\nin this horrible barbarity. The King and Queen of England, on their return\r\nfrom a journey to Scotland, arrived in Lincoln at the very time when the\r\ninhabitants were so much agitated by this mysterious announcement. The\r\npeople called for vengeance. An order was issued to the bailiffs and\r\nofficers of the King to deliver the murderer into the hands of justice,\r\nand the quarter in which the Jews had shut themselves up, so as to avoid\r\nthe public animosity, was immediately invaded by armed men. The rabbi, in\r\nwhose house the child was supposed to have been tortured, was seized, and\r\nat once condemned to be tied to the tail of a horse, and dragged through\r\nthe streets of the town. After this, his mangled body, which was only half\r\ndead, was hung (Fig. 359). Many of the Jews ran away and hid themselves in\r\nall parts of the kingdom, and those who had the misfortune to be caught\r\nwere thrown into chains and led to London. Orders were given in the\r\nprovinces to imprison all the Israelites who were accused or even\r\nsuspected of having taken any part, whether actively or indirectly, in the\r\nmurder of the Lincoln child; and suspicion made rapid strides in those\r\ndays. In a short space of time, eighteen Israelites in London shared the\r\nfate of the rabbi of their community in Lincoln. Some Dominican monks, who\r\nwere charitable and courageous enough to interfere in favour of the\r\nwretched prisoners, brought down odium on their own heads, and were\r\naccused of having allowed themselves to be corrupted by the money of the\r\nJews. Seventy-one prisoners were retained in the dungeons of London, and\r\nseemed inevitably fated to die, when the king's brother, Richard, came to\r\ntheir aid, by asserting his right over all the Jews of the kingdom--a\r\nright which the King had pledged to him for a loan of 5,000 silver marks.\r\nThe unfortunate prisoners were therefore saved, thanks to Richard's desire\r\nto protect his securities. History does not tell what their liberty cost\r\nthem; but we must hope that a sense of justice alone guided the English\r\nprince, and that the Jews found other means besides money by which to show\r\ntheir gratitude.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a country in Europe which cannot recount similar tales.\r\nIn 1171, we find the murder of a child at Orleans, or Blois, causing\r\ncapital punishment to be inflicted on several Jews. Imputations of this\r\nhorrible character were continually renewed during the Middle Ages, and\r\nwere of very ancient origin; for we hear of them in the times of Honorius\r\nand Theodosius the younger; we find them reproduced with equal vehemence\r\nin 1475 at Trent, where a furious mob was excited against the Jews, who\r\nwere accused of having destroyed a child twenty-nine months old named\r\nSimon. The tale of the martyrdom of this child was circulated widely, and\r\nwoodcut representations of it were freely distributed, which necessarily\r\nincreased, especially in Germany, the horror which was aroused in the\r\nminds of Christians against the accursed nation (Fig. 361).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.--The Infant Richard crucified by the Jews, at\r\nPontoise.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut, with Figures by Wohlgemuth, in the\r\n\"Liber Chronicarum Mundi:\" large folio, Nuremberg, 1493.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.--Martyrdom of Simon at Trent.--Fac-simile,\r\nreduced, of a Woodcut of Wohlgemuth, in the \"Liber Chronicarum Mundi:\"\r\nlarge folio, Nuremberg, 1493.]\r\n\r\nThe Jews gave cause for other accusations calculated to keep up this\r\nhatred; such as the desecration of the consecrated host, the mutilation of\r\nthe crucifix. Tradition informs us of a miracle which took place in Paris\r\nin 1290, in the Rue des Jardins, when a Jew dared to mutilate and boil a\r\nconsecrated host. This miracle was commemorated by the erection of a\r\nchapel on the spot, which was afterwards replaced by the church and\r\nconvent of the Billettes. In 1370, the people of Brussels were startled in\r\nconsequence of the statements of a Jewess, who accused her co-religionists\r\nof having made her carry a pyx full of stolen hosts to the Jews of\r\nCologne, for the purpose of submitting them to the most horrible\r\nprofanations. The woman added, that the Jews having pierced these hosts\r\nwith sticks and knives, such a quantity of blood poured from them that the\r\nculprits were struck with terror, and concealed themselves in their\r\nquarter. The Jews were all imprisoned, tortured, and burnt alive (Fig.\r\n362). In order to perpetuate the memory of the miracle of the bleeding\r\nhosts, an annual procession took place, which was the origin of the great\r\nkermesse, or annual fair.\r\n\r\nIn the event of any unforeseen misfortune, or any great catastrophe\r\noccurring amongst Christians, the odium was frequently cast on the Jews.\r\nIf the Crusaders met with reverses in Asia, fanatics formed themselves\r\ninto bands, who, under the name of _Pastoureaux_, spread over the country,\r\nkilling and robbing not only the Jews, but many Christians also. In the\r\nevent of any general sickness, and especially during the prevalence of\r\nepidemics, the Jews were accused of having poisoned the water of fountains\r\nand pits, and the people massacred them in consequence. Thousands perished\r\nin this way when the black plague made ravages in Europe in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The sovereigns, who were tardy in suppressing these sanguinary\r\nproceedings, never thought of indemnifying the Jewish families which so\r\nunjustly suffered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.--The Jews of Cologne burnt alive.--From a Woodcut\r\nin the \"Liber Chronicarum Mundi:\" large folio, Nuremberg, 1493.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was then most religiously believed that, by despising and\r\nholding the Jewish nation under the yoke, banished as it was from Judæa\r\nfor the murder of Jesus Christ, the will of the Almighty was being carried\r\nout, so much so that the greater number of kings and princes looked upon\r\nthemselves as absolute masters over the Jews who lived under their\r\nprotection. All feudal lords spoke with scorn of _their Jews_; they\r\nallowed them to establish themselves on their lands, but on the condition\r\nthat as they became the subjects and property of their lord, the latter\r\nshould draw his best income from them.\r\n\r\nWe have shown by an instance borrowed from the history of England that the\r\nJews were often mortgaged by the kings like land. This was not all, for\r\nthe Jews who inhabited Great Britain during the reign of Henry III., in\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century, were not only obliged to\r\nacknowledge, by voluntarily contributing large sums of money, the service\r\nthe King's brother had rendered them in clearing them from the imputation\r\nof having had any participation in the murder of the child Richard, but\r\nthe loan on mortgage, for which they were the material and passive\r\nsecurity, became the cause of odious extortions from them. The King had\r\npledged them to the Earl of Cornwall for 5,000 marks, but they themselves\r\nhad to repay the royal loan by means of enormous taxes. When they had\r\nsucceeded in cancelling the King's debt to his brother, that necessitous\r\nmonarch again mortgaged them, but on this occasion to his son Edward. Soon\r\nafter, the son having rebelled against his father, the latter took back\r\nhis Jews, and having assembled six elders from each of their communities,\r\nhe told them that he required 20,000 silver marks, and ordered them to pay\r\nhim that sum at two stated periods. The payments were rigorously exacted;\r\nthose who were behind-hand were imprisoned, and the debtor who was in\r\narrear for the second payment was sued for the whole sum. On the King's\r\ndeath his successor continued the same system of tyranny against the Jews.\r\nIn 1279 they were charged with having issued counterfeit coin, and on this\r\nvague or imaginary accusation two hundred and eighty men and women were\r\nput to death in London alone. In the counties there were also numerous\r\nexecutions, and many innocent persons were thrown into dungeons; and, at\r\nlast, in 1290 King Edward, who wished to enrich himself by taking\r\npossession of their properties, banished the Jews from his kingdom. A\r\nshort time before this, the English people had offered to pay an annual\r\nfine to the King on condition of his expelling the Jews from the country;\r\nbut the Jews outbid them, and thus obtained the repeal of the edict of\r\nbanishment. However, on this last occasion there was no mercy shown, and\r\nthe Jews, sixteen thousand in number, were expelled from England, and the\r\nKing seized upon their goods.\r\n\r\nAt the same period Philippe le Bel of France gave the example of this\r\nsystem of persecuting the Jews, but, instead of confiscating all their\r\ngoods, he was satisfied with taking one-fifth; his subjects, therefore,\r\nalmost accused him of generosity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363.--Jewish Conspiracy in France.--From a Miniature\r\nin the \"Pèlerinage de la Vie Humaine\" (Imperial Library, Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe Jews often took the precaution of purchasing certain rights and\r\nfranchises from their sovereign or from the feudal lord under whose sway\r\nthey lived; but generally these were one-sided bargains, for not being\r\nprotected by common rights, and only forming a very small part of the\r\npopulation, they could nowhere depend upon promises or privileges which\r\nhad been made to them, even though they had purchased them with their own\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nTo the uncertainty and annoyance of a life which was continually being\r\nthreatened, was added a number of vexatious and personal insults, even in\r\nordinary times, and when they enjoyed a kind of normal tolerance. They\r\nwere almost everywhere obliged to wear a visible mark on their dress,\r\nsuch as a patch of gaudy colour attached to the shoulder or chest, in\r\norder to prevent their being mistaken for Christians. By this or some\r\nother means they were continually subject to insults from the people, and\r\nonly succeeded in ridding themselves of it by paying the most enormous\r\nfines. Nothing was spared to humiliate and insult them. At Toulouse they\r\nwere forced to send a representative to the cathedral on every Good\r\nFriday, that he might there publicly receive a box on the ears. At\r\nBéziers, during Passion week, the mob assumed the right of attacking the\r\nJews' houses with stones. The Jews bought off this right in 1160 by paying\r\na certain sum to the Vicomte de Béziers, and by promising an annual\r\npoll-tax to him and to his successors. A Jew, passing on the road of\r\nEtampes, beneath the tower of Montlhéry, had to pay an obole; if he had in\r\nhis possession a Hebrew book, he paid four deniers; and, if he carried his\r\nlamp with him, two oboles. At Châteauneuf-sur-Loire a Jew on passing had\r\nto pay twelve deniers and a Jewess six. It has been said that there were\r\nvarious ancient rates levied upon Jews, in which they were treated like\r\ncattle, but this requires authentication. During the Carnival in Rome they\r\nwere forced to run in the lists, amidst the jeers of the populace. This\r\npublic outrage was stopped at a subsequent period by a tax of 300 écus,\r\nwhich a deputation from the Ghetto presented on their knees to the\r\nmagistrates of the city, at the same time thanking them for their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nWhen Pope Martin IV. arrived at the Council of Constance, in 1417, the\r\nJewish community, which was as numerous as it was powerful in that old\r\ncity, came in great state to present him with the book of the law (Fig.\r\n364). The holy father received the Jews kindly, and prayed God to open\r\ntheir eyes and bring them back into the bosom of his church. We know, too,\r\nhow charitable the popes were to the Jews.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the distressing position they occupied, it may be asked\r\nwhat powerful motive induced the Jews to live amongst nations who almost\r\ninvariably treated them as enemies, and to remain at the mercy of\r\nsovereigns whose sole object was to oppress, plunder, and subject them to\r\nall kinds of vexations? To understand this it is sufficient to remember\r\nthat, in their peculiar aptness for earning and hoarding money, they\r\nfound, or at least hoped to find, a means of compensation whereby they\r\nmight be led to forget the servitude to which they were subjected.\r\n\r\nThere existed amongst them, and especially in the southern countries,\r\nsome very learned men, who devoted themselves principally to medicine; and\r\nin order to avoid having to struggle against insuperable prejudice, they\r\nwere careful to disguise their nationality and religion in the exercise of\r\nthat art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364.--The Jewish Procession going to meet the Pope at\r\nthe Council of Constance, in 1417.--After a Miniature in the Manuscript\r\nChronicle of Ulrie de Reichental, in the Library of the Mansion-house of\r\nBasle, in Switzerland.]\r\n\r\nThey pretended, in order not to arouse the suspicion of their patients, to\r\nbe practitioners from Lombardy or Spain, or even from Arabia; whether they\r\nwere really clever, or only made a pretence of being so, in an art which\r\nwas then very much a compound of quackery and imposture, it is difficult\r\nto say, but they acquired wealth as well as renown in its practice. But\r\nthere was another science, to the study of which they applied themselves\r\nwith the utmost ardour and perseverance, and for which they possessed in a\r\nmarvellous degree the necessary qualities to insure success, and that\r\nscience was the science of finance. In matters having reference to the\r\nrecovering of arrears of taxes, to contracts for the sale of goods and\r\nproduce of industry, to turning a royalty to account, to making hazardous\r\ncommercial enterprises lucrative, or to the accumulating of large sums of\r\nmoney for the use of sovereigns or poor nobles, the Jews were always at\r\nhand, and might invariably be reckoned upon. They created capital, for\r\nthey always had funds to dispose of, even in the midst of the most\r\nterrible public calamities, and, when all other means were exhausted, when\r\nall expedients for filling empty purses had been resorted to without\r\nsuccess, the Jews were called in. Often, in consequence of the envy which\r\nthey excited from being known to possess hoards of gold, they were exposed\r\nto many dangers, which they nevertheless faced, buoying themselves up with\r\nthe insatiable love of gain.\r\n\r\nFew Christians in the Middle Ages were given to speculation, and they were\r\nespecially ignorant of financial matters, as demanding interest on loans\r\nwas almost always looked upon as usury, and, consequently, such dealings\r\nwere stigmatized as disgraceful. The Jews were far from sharing these\r\nhigh-minded scruples, and they took advantage of the ignorance of\r\nChristians by devoting themselves as much as possible to enterprises and\r\nspeculations, which were at all times the distinguishing occupation of\r\ntheir race. For this reason we find the Jews, who were engaged in the\r\nexport trade from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, doing a most\r\nexcellent business, even in the commercial towns of the Mediterranean. We\r\ncan, to a certain extent, in speaking of the intercourse of the Jews with\r\nthe Christians of the Middle Ages, apply what Lady Montague remarked as\r\nlate as 1717, when comparing the Jews of Turkey with the Mussulmans: \"The\r\nformer,\" she says, \"have monopolized all the commerce of the empire,\r\nthanks to the close ties which exist amongst them, and to the laziness and\r\nwant of industry of the Turks. No bargain is made without their\r\nconnivance. They are the physicians and stewards of all the nobility. It\r\nis easy to conceive the unity which this gives to a nation which never\r\ndespises the smallest profits. They have found means of rendering\r\nthemselves so useful, that they are certain of protection at court,\r\nwhoever the ruling minister may be. Many of them are enormously rich, but\r\nthey are careful to make but little outward display, although living in\r\nthe greatest possible luxury.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365.--Costume of an Italian Jew of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury.--From a Painting by Sano di Pietro, preserved in the Academy of\r\nthe Fine Arts, at Sienna.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Jews' Passover.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of a miniature from a missel of fifteenth century ornamented\r\nwith paintings of the School of Van Eyck. Bibl. de l'Arsenal, Th. lat., no\r\n199.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Jews in the East was never so precarious nor so\r\ndifficult as it was in the West. From the Councils of Paris, in 615, down\r\nto the end of the fifteenth century, the nobles and the civil and\r\necclesiastical authorities excluded the Jews from administrative\r\npositions; but it continually happened that a positive want of money,\r\nagainst which the Jews were ever ready to provide, caused a repeal or\r\nmodification of these arbitrary measures. Moreover, Christians did not\r\nfeel any scruple in parting with their most valued treasures, and giving\r\nthem as pledges to the Jews for a loan of money when they were in need of\r\nit. This plan of lending on pledge, or usury, belonged specially to the\r\nJews in Europe during the Middle Ages, and was both the cause of their\r\nprosperity and of their misfortune. Of their prosperity, because they\r\ncleverly contrived to become possessors of all the coin; and of their\r\nmisfortune, because their usurious demands became so detrimental to the\r\npublic welfare, and were often exacted with such unscrupulous severity,\r\nthat people not unfrequently became exasperated, and acts of violence were\r\ncommitted, which as often fell upon the innocent as upon the guilty. The\r\ngreater number of the acts of banishment were those for which no other\r\nmotive was assigned, or, at all events, no other pretext was made, than\r\nthe usury practised by these strangers in the provinces and in the towns\r\nin which they were permitted to reside. When the Christians heard that\r\nthese rapacious guests had harshly pressed and entirely stripped certain\r\npoor debtors, when they learned that the debtors, ruined by usury, were\r\nstill kept prisoners in the house of their pitiless creditors, general\r\nindignation often manifested itself by personal attacks. This feeling was\r\nfrequently shared by the authorities themselves, who, instead of\r\ndispensing equal justice to the strangers and to the citizens, according\r\nto the spirit of the law, often decided with partiality, and even with\r\nresentment, and in some cases abandoned the Jews to the fury of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe people's feelings of hatred against the sordid avarice of the Jews was\r\ncontinually kept up by ballads which were sung, and legends which were\r\nrelated, in the public streets of the cities and in the cottages of the\r\nvillages--ballads and legends in which usurers were depicted in hideous\r\ncolours (Fig. 366). The most celebrated of these popular compositions was\r\nevidently that which must have furnished the idea to Shakespeare of the\r\n_Merchant of Venice_, for in this old English drama mention is made of a\r\nbargain struck between a Jew and a Christian, who borrows money of him, on\r\ncondition that, if he cannot refund it on a certain day, the lender shall\r\nhave the right of cutting a pound of flesh from his body. All the evil\r\nwhich the people said and thought of the Jews during the Middle Ages seems\r\nconcentrated in the Shylock of the English poet.\r\n\r\nThe rate of interest for loans was, nevertheless, everywhere settled by\r\nlaw, and at all times. This rate varied according to the scarcity of\r\ngold, and was always high enough to give a very ample profit to the\r\nlenders, although they too often required a very much higher rate. In\r\ntruth, the small security offered by those borrowing, and the arbitrary\r\nmanner in which debts were at times cancelled, increased the risks of the\r\nlender and the normal difficulties of obtaining a loan. We find\r\neverywhere, in all ancient legislations, a mass of rules on the rate of\r\npecuniary interest to be allowed to the Jews.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366.--Legend of the Jew calling the Devil from a\r\nVessel of Blood.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in Boaistuau's \"Histoires\r\nProdigieuses:\" in 4to, Paris, Annet Briere, 1560.]\r\n\r\nIn some countries, especially in England, precautionary measures were\r\ntaken for regulating the compacts entered into between Christians and\r\nJews. One of the departments of the Exchequer received the register of\r\nthese compacts, which thus acquired a legal value. However, it was not\r\nunfrequent for the kings of England to grant, of their own free will,\r\nletters of release to persons owing money to Jews; and these letters,\r\nwhich were often equivalent to the cancelling of the entire debt, were\r\neven at times actually purchased from the sovereign. Mention of sums\r\nreceived by the royal treasury for the liberation of debtors, or for\r\nenabling them to recover their mortgaged lands without payment, may still\r\nbe found in the registers of the Exchequer of London; at the same time,\r\nJews, on the other hand, also paid the King large sums, in order that he\r\nmight allow justice to take its course against powerful debtors who were\r\nin arrear, and who could not be induced to pay. We thus see that if the\r\nJews practised usury, the Christians, and especially kings and powerful\r\nnobles, defrauded the Jews in every way, and were too often disposed to\r\nsell to them the smallest concessions at a great price. Indeed, Christians\r\noften went so far as to persecute them, in order to obtain the greatest\r\npossible amount from them; and the Jews of the Middle Ages put up with\r\nanything provided they could enrich themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367.--View and Plan of Jerusalem.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodout in the \"Liber Chronicarum Mundi\" large folio, Nuremberg, 1493.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that, great as were their capabilities,\r\nthe Jews exclusively devoted themselves to financial matters. When they\r\nwere permitted to trade they were well satisfied to become artisans or\r\nagriculturists. In Spain they proved themselves most industrious, and that\r\nkingdom suffered a great loss in consequence of their being expelled from\r\nit. In whatever country they established themselves, the Jews carried on\r\nmost of the mechanical and manual industries with cleverness and success;\r\nbut they could not hope to become landed proprietors in countries where\r\nthey were in such bad odour, and where the possession of land, far from\r\noffering them any security, could not fail to excite the envy of their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIf, as is the case, Oriental people are of a serious turn of mind, it is\r\neasy to understand that the Jews should have been still more so, since\r\nthey were always objects of hatred and abhorrence. We find a touching\r\nallegory in the Talmud. Each time that a human being is created God orders\r\nhis angels to bring a soul before his throne, and orders this soul to go\r\nand inhabit the body which is about to be born on earth. The soul is\r\ngrieved, and supplicates the Supreme Being to spare it that painful trial,\r\nin which it only sees sorrow and affliction. This allegory may be suitably\r\napplied to a people who have only to expect contempt, mistrust, and\r\nhatred, everywhere. The Israelites, therefore, clung enthusiastically to\r\nthe hope of the advent of a Messiah who should bring back to them the\r\nhappy days of the land of promise, and they looked upon their absence from\r\nPalestine as only a passing exile. \"But,\" the Christians said to them,\r\n\"this Messiah has long since come.\" \"Alas!\" they answered, \"if He had\r\nappeared on earth should we still be miserable?\" Fulbert, Bishop of\r\nChartres, preached three sermons to undeceive the Jews, by endeavouring to\r\nprove to them that their Messiah was no other than Jesus Christ; but he\r\npreached to the winds, for the Jews remained obstinately attached to their\r\nillusion that the Messiah was yet to come.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the Jews, who mixed up the mysteries and absurdities of the\r\nTalmud with the ancient laws and numerous rules of the religion of their\r\nancestors, found in the practice of their national customs, and in the\r\ncelebration of their mysterious ceremonies, the sweetest emotions,\r\nespecially when they could devote themselves to them in the peaceful\r\nretirement of the Ghetto; for, in all the countries in which they lived\r\nscattered and isolated amongst Christians, they were careful to conceal\r\ntheir worship and to conduct their ceremonial as secretly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe clergy, in striving to convert the Jews, repeatedly had conferences\r\nwith the rabbis of a controversial character, which often led to quarrels,\r\nand aggravated the lot of the Jewish community. If Catholic proselystism\r\nsucceeded in completely detaching a few individuals or a few families from\r\nthe Israelitish creed, these ardent converts rekindled the horror of the\r\npeople against their former co-religionists by revealing some of the\r\nprecepts of the Talmud. Sometimes the conversion of whole masses of Jews\r\nwas effected, but this happened much less through conviction on their part\r\nthan through the fear of exile, plunder, or execution.\r\n\r\nThese pretended conversions, however, did not always protect them from\r\ndanger. In Spain the Inquisition kept a close watch on converted Jews,\r\nand, if they were not true to their new faith, severe punishment was\r\ninflicted upon them. In 1506, the inhabitants of Abrantès, a town of\r\nPortugal, massacred all the baptized Jews. Manoël, a king of Portugal,\r\nforbad the converts from selling their goods and leaving his dominions.\r\nThe Church excluded them from ecclesiastical dignities, and, when they\r\nsucceeded in obtaining civil employments, they were received with\r\ndistrust. In France the Parliaments tried, with a show of justice, to\r\nprevent converted Jews from being reproached for their former condition;\r\nbut Louis XII., during his pressing wants, did not scruple to exact a\r\nspecial tax from them. And, in 1611, we again find that they were unjustly\r\ndenounced, and under the form of a _Remonstrance to the King and the\r\nParliament of Provence, on account of the great family alliances of the\r\nnew converts_, an appeal was made for the most cruel reprisals against\r\nthis unfortunate race, \"which deserved only to be banished and their goods\r\nconfiscated.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368.--Jewish Ceremony before the Ark.--Fac-simile of a woodcut\r\nprinted at Troyes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGipsies, Tramps, Beggars, and Cours des Miracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  First Appearance of Gipsies in the West.--Gipsies in Paris.--Manners and\r\n  Customs of these Wandering Tribes.--Tricks of Captain Charles.--Gipsies\r\n  expelled by Royal Edict.--Language of Gipsies.--The Kingdom of\r\n  Slang.--The Great Coesre, Chief of the Vagrants; his Vassals and\r\n  Subjects.--Divisions of the Slang People; its Decay and the Causes\r\n  thereof.--Cours des Miracles.--The Camp of Rognes.--Cunning Language, or\r\n  Slang.--Foreign Rogues, Thieves, and Pickpockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1417 the inhabitants of the countries situated near the mouth\r\nof the Elbe were disturbed by the arrival of strangers, whose manners and\r\nappearance were far from pre-possessing. These strange travellers took a\r\ncourse thence towards the Teutonic Hanse, starting from Luneburg: they\r\nsubsequently proceeded to Hamburg, and then, going from east to west along\r\nthe Baltic, they visited the free towns of Lubeck, Wismar, Rostock,\r\nStralsund, and Greifswald.\r\n\r\nThese new visitors, known in Europe under the names of _Zingari, Cigani,\r\nGipsies, Gitanos, Egyptians_, or _Bohemians_, but who, in their own\r\nlanguage, called themselves _Romi_, or _gens mariés_, numbered about three\r\nhundred men and women, besides the children, who were very numerous. They\r\ndivided themselves into seven bands, all of which followed the same track.\r\nVery dirty, excessively ugly, and remarkable for their dark complexions,\r\nthese people had for their leaders a duke and a count, as they were\r\ncalled, who were superbly dressed, and to whom they acknowledged\r\nallegiance. Some of them rode on horseback, whilst others went on foot.\r\nThe women and children travelled on beasts of burden and in waggons (Fig.\r\n369). If we are to believe their own story, their wandering life was\r\ncaused by their return to Paganism after having been previously converted\r\nto the Christian faith, and, as a punishment for their sin, they were to\r\ncontinue their adventurous course for a period of seven years. They showed\r\nletters of recommendation from various princes, among others from\r\nSigismund, King of the Romans, and these letters, whether authentic or\r\nfalse, procured for them a welcome wherever they went. They encamped in\r\nthe fields at night, because the habit they indulged in of stealing\r\neverything for which they had a fancy, caused them to fear being disturbed\r\nin the towns. It was not long, however, before many of them were arrested\r\nand put to death for theft, when the rest speedily decamped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369.--Gipsies on the March.--Fifteenth Century Piece\r\nof old Tapestry in the Château d'Effiat, contributed by M.A. Jubinal.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following year we find them at Meissen, in Saxony,\r\nwhence they were driven out on account of the robberies and disturbances\r\nthey committed; and then in Switzerland, where they passed through the\r\ncountries of the Grisons, the cantons of Appenzell, and Zurich, stopping\r\nin Argovie. Chroniclers who mention them at that time speak of their\r\nchief, Michel, as Duke of Egypt, and relate that these strangers, calling\r\nthemselves Egyptians, pretended that they were driven from their country\r\nby the Sultan of Turkey, and condemned to wander for seven years in want\r\nand misery. These chroniclers add that they were very honest people, who\r\nscrupulously followed all the practices of the Christian religion; that\r\nthey were poorly clad, but that they had gold and silver in abundance;\r\nthat they lived well, and paid for everything they had; and that, at the\r\nend of seven years, they went away to return home, as they said. However,\r\nwhether because a considerable number remained on the road, or because\r\nthey had been reinforced by others of the same tribe during the year, a\r\ntroop of fifty men, accompanied by a number of hideous women and filthy\r\nchildren, made their appearance in the neighbourhood of Augsburg. These\r\nvagabonds gave out that they were exiles from Lower Egypt, and pretended\r\nto know the art of predicting coming events. It was soon found out that\r\nthey were much less versed in divination and in the occult sciences than\r\nin the arts of plundering, roguery, and cheating.\r\n\r\nIn the following year a similar horde, calling themselves Saracens,\r\nappeared at Sisteron, in Provence; and on the 18th. of July, 1422, a\r\nchronicler of Bologna mentions the arrival in that town of a troop of\r\nforeigners, commanded by a certain André, Duke of Egypt, and composed of\r\nat least one hundred persons, including women and children. They encamped\r\ninside and outside the gate _di Galiera_, with the exception of the duke,\r\nwho lodged at the inn _del Re_. During the fifteen days which they spent\r\nat Bologna a number of the people of the town went to see them, and\r\nespecially to see \"the wife of the duke,\" who, it was said, knew how to\r\nforetell future events, and to tell what was to happen to people, what\r\ntheir fortunes would be, the number of their children, if they were good\r\nor bad, and many other things (Fig. 370). Few men, however, left the house\r\nof the so-called Duke of Egypt without having their purses stolen, and but\r\nfew women escaped without having the skirts of their dresses cut. The\r\nEgyptian women walked about the town in groups of six or seven, and whilst\r\nsome were talking to the townspeople, telling them their fortunes, or\r\nbartering in shops, one of their number would lay her hands on anything\r\nwhich was within reach. So many robberies were committed in this way, that\r\nthe magistrates of the town and the ecclesiastical authorities forbad the\r\ninhabitants from visiting the Egyptians' camp, or from having any\r\nintercourse with them, under penalty of excommunication and of a fine of\r\nfifty livres. Besides this, by a strange application of the laws of\r\nretaliation, those who had been robbed by these foreigners were permitted\r\nto rob them to the extent of the value of the things stolen. In\r\nconsequence of this, the Bolognians entered a stable in which several of\r\nthe Egyptians' horses were kept, and took out one of the finest of them.\r\nIn order to recover him the Egyptians agreed to restore what they had\r\ntaken, and the restitution was made. But perceiving that they could no\r\nlonger do any good for themselves in this province, they struck their\r\ntents and started for Rome, to which city they said they were bound to go,\r\nnot only in order to accomplish a pilgrimage imposed upon them by the\r\nSultan, who had expelled them from their own land, but especially to\r\nobtain letters of absolution from the Holy Father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370.--Gipsies Fortune-telling.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle,\r\n1552.]\r\n\r\nIn 1422 the band left Italy, and we find them at Basle and in Suabia.\r\nThen, besides the imperial passports, of which they had up to that time\r\nalone boasted, they pretended to have in their possession bulls which they\r\nstated that they had obtained from the Pope. They also modified their\r\noriginal tale, and stated that they were descendants of the Egyptians who\r\nrefused hospitality to the Holy Virgin and to St. Joseph during their\r\nflight into Egypt: they also declared that, in consequence of this crime,\r\nGod had doomed their race to perpetual misery and exile.\r\n\r\nFive years later we find them in the neighbourhood of Paris. \"The Sunday\r\nafter the middle of August,\" says \"The Journal of a Bourgeois of Paris,\"\r\n\"there came to Paris twelve so-called pilgrims, that is to say, a duke, a\r\ncount, and ten men, all on horseback; they said that they were very good\r\nChristians, and that they came from Lower Egypt; ... and on the 29th of\r\nAugust, the anniversary of the beheading of St. John, the rest of the band\r\nmade their appearance. These, however, were not allowed to enter Paris,\r\nbut, by order of the provost, were lodged in the Chapel of St. Denis. They\r\ndid not number more than one hundred and twenty, including women and\r\nchildren. They stated that, when they left their own country, they\r\nnumbered from a thousand to twelve hundred, but that the rest had died on\r\nthe road..... Whilst they were at the chapel never was such a concourse of\r\npeople collected, even at the blessing of the fair of Landit, as went from\r\nParis, St. Denis, and elsewhere, to see these strangers. Almost all of\r\nthem had their ears pierced, and in each one or two silver rings, which in\r\ntheir country, they said, was a mark of nobility. The men were very\r\nswarthy, with curly hair; the women were very ugly, and extremely dark,\r\nwith long black hair, like a horse's tail; their only garment being an old\r\nrug tied round the shoulder by a strip of cloth or a bit of rope (Fig.\r\n371). Amongst them were several fortune-tellers, who, by looking into\r\npeople's hands, told them what had happened or what was to happen to them,\r\nand by this means often did a good deal to sow discord in families. What\r\nwas worse, either by magic, by Satanic agency, or by sleight of hand, they\r\nmanaged to empty people's purses whilst talking to them.... So, at least,\r\nevery one said. At last accounts respecting them reached the ears of the\r\nBishop of Paris. He went to them with a Franciscan friar, called Le Petit\r\nJacobin, who, by the bishop's order, delivered an earnest address to them,\r\nand excommunicated all those who had anything to do with them, or who had\r\ntheir fortunes told. He further advised the gipsies to go away, and, on\r\nthe festival of Notre-Dame, they departed for Pontoise.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371.--A Gipsy Family.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the\r\n\"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]\r\n\r\nHere, again, the gipsies somewhat varied their story. They said that they\r\nwere originally Christians; but that, in consequence of an invasion by the\r\nSaracens, they had been forced to renounce their religion; that, at a\r\nsubsequent period, powerful monarchs had come to free them from the yoke\r\nof the infidels, and had decreed that, as a punishment to them for having\r\nrenounced the Christian faith, they should not be allowed to return to\r\ntheir country before they had obtained permission from the Pope. They\r\nstated that the Holy Father, to whom they had gone to confess their sins,\r\nhad then ordered them to wander about the world for seven years, without\r\nsleeping in beds, at the same time giving direction to every bishop and\r\nevery priest whom they met to offer them ten livres; a direction which the\r\nabbots and bishops were in no hurry to obey. These strange pilgrims stated\r\nthat they had been only five years on the road when they arrived in Paris.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that, although the object of their long\r\npilgrimage was ostensibly a pious one, the Egyptians or gipsies were not\r\nvery slow in giving to the people whom they visited a true estimate of\r\ntheir questionable honesty, and we do not think it would be particularly\r\ninteresting to follow step by step the track of this odious band, which\r\nfrom this period made its appearance sometimes in one country and\r\nsometimes in another, not only in the north but in the south, and\r\nespecially in the centre of Europe. Suffice it to say that their quarrels\r\nwith the authorities, or the inhabitants of the countries which had the\r\nmisfortune to be periodically visited by them, have left numerous traces\r\nin history.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of November, 1453, from sixty to eighty gipsies, coming from\r\nCourtisolles, arrived at the entrance of the town of Cheppe, near\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne. The strangers, many of whom carried \"javelins, darts,\r\nand other implements of war,\" having asked for hospitality, the mayor of\r\nthe town informed them \"that it was not long since some of the same\r\ncompany, or others very like them, had been lodged in the town, and had\r\nbeen guilty of various acts of theft.\" The gipsies persisted in their\r\ndemands, the indignation of the people was aroused, and they were soon\r\nobliged to resume their journey. During their unwilling retreat, they were\r\npursued by many of the inhabitants of the town, one of whom killed a gipsy\r\nnamed Martin de la Barre: the murderer, however, obtained the King's\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nIn 1532, at Pleinpalais, a suburb of Geneva, some rascals from among a\r\nband of gipsies, consisting of upwards of three hundred in number, fell\r\nupon several of the officers who were stationed to prevent their entering\r\nthe town. The citizens hurried up to the scene of disturbance. The gipsies\r\nretired to the monastery of the Augustin friars, in which they fortified\r\nthemselves: the bourgeois besieged them, and would have committed summary\r\njustice on them, but the authorities interfered, and some twenty of the\r\nvagrants were arrested, but they sued for mercy, and were discharged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372.--Gipsy Encampment.--Fac-simile of a Copper-plate\r\nby Callot.]\r\n\r\nIn 1632, the inhabitants of Viarme, in the Department of Lot-et-Garonne,\r\nmade an onslaught upon a troop of gipsies who wanted to take up their\r\nquarters in that town. The whole of them were killed, with the exception\r\nof their chief, who was taken prisoner and brought before the Parliament\r\nof Bordeaux, and ordered to be hung. Twenty-one years before this, the\r\nmayor and magistrates of Bordeaux gave orders to the soldiers of the watch\r\nto arrest a gipsy chief, who, having shut himself up in the tower of\r\nVeyrines, at Merignac, ransacked the surrounding country. On the 21st of\r\nJuly, 1622, the same magistrates ordered the gipsies to leave the parish\r\nof Eysines within twenty-four hours, under penalty of the lash.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that the gipsies used violence or openly resisted\r\nauthority; they more frequently had recourse to artifice and cunning in\r\norder to attain their end. A certain Captain Charles acquired a great\r\nreputation amongst them for the clever trickeries which he continually\r\nconceived, and which his troop undertook to carry out. A chronicler of the\r\ntime says, that by means of certain herbs which he gave to a half-starved\r\nhorse, he made him into a fat and sleek animal; the horse was then sold at\r\none of the neighbouring fairs or markets, but the purchaser detected the\r\nfraud within a week, for the horse soon became thin again, and usually\r\nsickened and died.\r\n\r\nTallemant des Réaux relates that, on one occasion, Captain Charles and his\r\nattendants took up their quarters in a village, the curé of which being\r\nrich and parsimonious, was much disliked by his parishioners. The curé\r\nnever left his house, and the gipsies could not, therefore, get an\r\nopportunity to rob him. In this difficulty, they pretended that one of\r\nthem had committed a crime, and had been condemned to be hung a quarter of\r\na league from the village, where they betook themselves with all their\r\ngoods. The man, at the foot of the gibbet, asked for a confessor, and they\r\nwent to fetch the curé. He, at first, refused to go, but his parishioners\r\ncompelled him. During his absence some gipsies entered his house, took\r\nfive hundred écus from his strong box, and quickly rejoined the troop. As\r\nsoon as the rascal saw them returning, he said that he appealed to the\r\nking of _la petite Egypte_, upon which the captain exclaimed, \"Ah! the\r\ntraitor! I expected he would appeal.\" Immediately they packed up, secured\r\nthe prisoner, and were far enough away from the scene before the curé\r\nre-entered his house.\r\n\r\nTallemant relates another good trick. Near Roye, in Picardy, a gipsy who\r\nhad stolen a sheep offered it to a butcher for one hundred sous (about\r\nsixty francs of our money), but the butcher declined to give more than\r\nfour livres for it. The butcher then went away; whereupon the gipsy pulled\r\nthe sheep from a sack into which he had put it, and substituted for it a\r\nchild belonging to his tribe. He then ran after the butcher, and said,\r\n\"Give me five livres, and you shall have the sack into the bargain.\" The\r\nbutcher paid him the money, and went away. When he got home he opened the\r\nsack, and was much astonished when he saw a little boy jump out of it,\r\nwho, in an instant, caught up the sack and ran off. \"Never was a poor man\r\nso thoroughly hoaxed as this butcher,\" says Tallemant des Réaux.\r\n\r\nThe gipsies had thousands of other tricks in stock as good as the ones we\r\nhave just related, in proof of which we have but to refer to the testimony\r\nof one of their own tribe, who, under the name of Pechon de Ruby,\r\npublished, towards the close of the sixteenth century, \"La Vie Généreuse\r\ndes Mattois, Guex, Bohémiens, et Cagoux.\" \"When they want to leave a place\r\nwhere they have been stopping, they set out in an opposite direction to\r\nthat in which they are going, and after travelling about half a league\r\nthey take their right course. They possess the best and most accurate\r\nmaps, in which are laid down not only all the towns, villages, and rivers,\r\nbut also the houses of the gentry and others; and they fix upon places of\r\nrendezvous every ten days, at twenty leagues from the point from whence\r\nthey set out.... The captain hands over to each of the chiefs three or\r\nfour families to take charge of, and these small bands take different\r\ncross-roads towards the place of rendezvous. Those who are well armed and\r\nmounted he sends off with a good almanac, on which are marked all the\r\nfairs, and they continually change their dress and their horses. When they\r\ntake up their quarters in any village they steal very little in its\r\nimmediate vicinity, but in the neighbouring parishes they rob and plunder\r\nin the most daring manner. If they find a sum of money they give notice to\r\nthe captain, and make a rapid flight from the place. They coin counterfeit\r\nmoney, and put it into circulation. They play at all sorts of games; they\r\nbuy all sorts of horses; whether sound or unsound, provided they can\r\nmanage to pay for them in their own base coin. When they buy food they pay\r\nfor it in good money the first time, as they are held in such distrust;\r\nbut, when they are about to leave a neighbourhood, they again buy\r\nsomething, for which they tender false coin, receiving the change in good\r\nmoney. In harvest time all doors are shut against them; nevertheless they\r\ncontrive, by means of picklocks and other instruments, to effect an\r\nentrance into houses, when they steal linen, cloaks, silver, and any other\r\nmovable article which they can lay their hands on. They give a strict\r\naccount of everything to their captain, who takes his share of all they\r\nget, except of what they earn by fortune-telling. They are very clever at\r\nmaking a good bargain; when they know of a rich merchant being in the\r\nplace, they disguise themselves, enter into communications with him, and\r\nswindle him, ... after which they change their clothes, have their horses\r\nshod the reverse way, and the shoes covered with some soft material lest\r\nthey should be heard, and gallop away.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373.--The Gipsy who used to wash his Hands in Molten\r\nLead.--Fac-simile of a Woodcut in the \"Histoires Merveilleuses\" of Pierre\r\nBoaistuau: in 4to, 1560.]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Histoire Générale des Larrons\" we read that the vagabonds called\r\ngipsies sometimes played tricks with goblets, sometimes danced on the\r\ntight-rope, turned double-somersaults, and performed other feats (Fig.\r\n373), which proves that these adventurers adopted all kinds of methods of\r\ngaining a livelihood, highway robbery not excepted. We must not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised if in almost all countries very severe police\r\nmeasures were taken against this dangerous race, though we must admit that\r\nthese measures sometimes partook of a barbarous character.\r\n\r\nAfter having forbidden them, with a threat of six years at the galleys, to\r\nsojourn in Spain, Charles V. ordered them to leave Flanders under penalty\r\nof death. In 1545, a gipsy who had infringed the sentence of banishment\r\nwas condemned by the Court of Utrecht to be flogged till the blood\r\nappeared, to have his nostrils slit, his hair removed, his beard shaved\r\noff, and to be banished for life. \"We can form some idea,\" says the German\r\nhistorian Grellman, \"of the miserable condition of the gipsies from the\r\nfollowing facts: many of them, and especially the women, have been burned\r\nby their own request, in order to end their miserable state of existence;\r\nand we can give the case of a gipsy who, having been arrested, flogged,\r\nand conducted to the frontier, with the threat that if he reappeared in\r\nthe country he would be hanged, resolutely returned after three successive\r\nand similar threats, at three different places, and implored that the\r\ncapital sentence might be carried out, in order that he might be released\r\nfrom a life of such misery. These unfortunate people,\" continues the\r\nhistorian, \"were not even looked upon as human beings, for, during a\r\nhunting party, consisting of members of a small German court, the huntsmen\r\nhad no scruple whatever in killing a gipsy woman who was suckling her\r\nchild, just as they would have done any wild beast which came in their\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nM. Francisque Michel says, \"Amongst the questions which arise from a\r\nconsideration of the existence of this remarkable people, is one which,\r\nalthough neglected, is nevertheless of considerable interest, namely, how,\r\nwith a strange language, unlike any used in Europe, the gipsies could make\r\nthemselves understood by the people amongst whom they made their\r\nappearance for the first time: newly arrived in the west, they could have\r\nnone of those interpreters who are only to be found amongst a\r\nlong-established people, and who have political and commercial intercourse\r\nwith other nations. Where, then, did the gipsies obtain interpreters? The\r\nanswer seems to us to be clear. Receiving into their ranks all those whom\r\ncrime, the fear of punishment, an uneasy conscience, or the charm of a\r\nroaming life, continually threw in their path, they made use of them\r\neither to find their way into countries of which they were ignorant, or to\r\ncommit robberies which would otherwise have been impracticable. Themselves\r\nadepts in all sorts of bad practices, they were not slow to form an\r\nalliance with profligate characters who sometimes worked in concert with\r\nthem, and sometimes alone, and who always framed the model for their own\r\norganization from that of the gipsies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.--Orphans, _Callots_, and the Family of the Grand\r\nCoesre.--From painted Hangings and Tapestry from the Town of Rheims,\r\nexecuted during the Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThis alliance--governed by statutes, the honour of compiling which has\r\nbeen given to a certain Ragot, who styled himself captain--was composed of\r\n_matois_, or sharpers; of _mercelots_, or hawkers, who were very little\r\nbetter than the former; of _gueux_, or dishonest beggars, and of a host of\r\nother swindlers, constituting the order or hierarchy of the _Argot_, or\r\nSlang people. Their chief was called the _Grand Coesre_, \"a vagabond\r\nbroken to all the tricks of his trade,\" says M. Francisque Michel, and who\r\nfrequently ended his days on the rack or the gibbet. History has furnished\r\nus with the story of a \"miserable cripple\" who used to sit in a wooden\r\nbowl, and who, after having been Grand Coesre for three years, was broken\r\nalive on the wheel at Bordeaux for his crimes. He was called _Roi de\r\nTunes_ (Tunis), and was drawn about by two large dogs. One of his\r\nsuccessors, the Grand Coesre surnamed Anacréon, who suffered from the same\r\ninfirmity, namely, that of a cripple, rode about Paris on a donkey\r\nbegging. He generally held his court on the Port-au-Foin, where he sat on\r\nhis throne dressed in a mantle made of a thousand pieces. The Grand Coesre\r\nhad a lieutenant in each province called _cagou_, whose business it was to\r\ninitiate apprentices in the secrets of the craft, and who looked after,\r\nin different localities, those whom the chief had entrusted to his care.\r\nHe gave an account of the property he received in thus exercising his\r\nstewardship, and of the money as well as of the clothing which he took\r\nfrom the _Argotiers_ who refused to recognise his authority. As a\r\nremuneration for their duties, the cagoux were exempt from all tribute to\r\ntheir chief; they received their share of the property taken from persons\r\nwhom they had ordered to be robbed, and they were free to beg in any way\r\nthey pleased. After the cagoux came the _archisuppôts_, who, being\r\nrecruited from the lowest dregs of the clergy and others who had been in a\r\nbetter position, were, so to speak, the teachers of the law. To them was\r\nintrusted the duty of instructing the less experienced rogues, and of\r\ndetermining the language of Slang; and, as a reward for their good and\r\nloyal services, they had the right of begging without paying any fees to\r\ntheir chiefs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375.--The Blind and the Poor Sick of St. John.--From\r\npainted Hangings and Tapestry in the Town of Rheims, executed during the\r\nFifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Coesre levied a tax of twenty-four sous per annum upon the young\r\nrogues, who went about the streets pretending to shed tears (Fig. 374), as\r\n\"helpless orphans,\" in order to excite public sympathy. The _marcandiers_\r\nhad to pay an écu; they were tramps clothed in a tolerably good doublet,\r\nwho passed themselves off as merchants ruined by war, by fire, or by\r\nhaving been robbed on the highway. The _malingreux_ had to pay forty sous;\r\nthey were covered with sores, most of which were self-inflicted, or they\r\npretended to have swellings of some kind, and stated that they were about\r\nto undertake a pilgrimage to St. Méen, in Brittany, in order to be cured.\r\nThe _piètres_, or lame rogues, paid half an écu, and walked with crutches.\r\nThe _sabouleux_, who were commonly called the _poor sick of St. John_,\r\nwere in the habit of frequenting fairs and markets, or the vicinity of\r\nchurches; there, smeared with blood and appearing as if foaming at the\r\nmouth by means of a piece of soap they had placed in it, they struggled on\r\nthe ground as if in a fit, and in this way realised a considerable amount\r\nof alms. These consequently paid the largest fees to the Coesre (Fig.\r\n375).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376.--The _Ruffes_ and the _Millards_.--From painted\r\nHangings and Tapestry of Rheims, executed about the Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were the _callots_, who were either affected with a\r\nscurfy disease or pretended to be so, and who were contributors to the\r\ncivil list of their chief to the amount of sevens sous; as also the\r\n_coquillards_, or pretended pilgrims of St. James or St. Michael; and the\r\n_hubins_, who, according to the forged certificate which they carried with\r\nthem, were going to, or returning from, St. Hubert, after having been\r\nbitten by a mad dog. The _polissons_ paid two écus to the Coesre, but they\r\nearned a considerable amount, especially in winter; for benevolent people,\r\ntouched with their destitution and half-nakedness, gave them sometimes a\r\ndoublet, sometimes a shirt, or some other article of clothing, which of\r\ncourse they immediately sold. The _francs mitoux_, who were never taxed\r\nabove five sous, were sickly members of the fraternity, or at all events\r\npretended to be such; they tied their arms above the elbow so as to stop\r\nthe pulse, and fell down apparently fainting on the public footpaths. We\r\nmust also mention the _ruffés_ and the _millards_, who went into the\r\ncountry in groups begging (Fig. 376). The _capons_ were cut-purses, who\r\nhardly ever left the towns, and who laid hands on everything within their\r\nreach. The _courtauds de boutanche_ pretended to be workmen, and were to\r\nbe met with everywhere with the tools of their craft on their back, though\r\nthey never used them. The _convertis_ pretended to have been impressed by\r\nthe exhortations of some excellent preacher, and made a public profession\r\nof faith; they afterwards stationed themselves at church doors, as\r\nrecently converted Catholics, and in this way received liberal\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nLastly, we must mention the _drilles_, the _narquois_, or the people of\r\nthe _petite flambe_, who for the most part were old pensioners, and who\r\nbegged in the streets from house to house, with their swords at their\r\nsides (Fig. 377). These, who at times lived a racketing and luxurious\r\nlife, at last rebelled against the Grand Coesre, and would no longer be\r\nreckoned among his subjects--a step which gave a considerable shock to the\r\nArgotic monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377.--The _Drille_ or _Narquois_.--From painted\r\nHangings from the Town of Rheims (Fifteenth Century).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378.--Perspective View of Paris in 1607.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Copper-plate by Léonard Gaultier. (Collection of M. Guénebault,\r\nParis.)]\r\n\r\nThere was another cause which greatly contributed to diminish the power\r\nas well as the prestige of this eccentric sovereign, and this was, that\r\nthe cut-purses, the night-prowlers and wood-thieves, not finding\r\nsufficient means of livelihood in their own department, and seeing that\r\nthe Argotiers, on the contrary, were always in a more luxurious position,\r\ntried to amalgamate robbery with mendicity, which raised an outcry amongst\r\nthese sections of their community. The archisuppôts and the cagoux at\r\nfirst declined such an alliance, but eventually they were obliged to admit\r\nall, with the exception of the wood-thieves, who were altogether excluded.\r\nIn the seventeenth century, therefore, in order to become a thorough\r\nArgotier, it was necessary not only to solicit alms like any mere beggar,\r\nbut also to possess the dexterity of the cut-purse and the thief. These\r\narts were to be learned in the places which served as the habitual\r\nrendezvous of the very dregs of society, and which were generally known as\r\nthe _Cours des Miracles_. These houses, or rather resorts, had been so\r\ncalled, if we are to believe a writer of the early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, \"Because rogues ... and others, who have all day been cripples,\r\nmaimed, dropsical, and beset with every sort of bodily ailment, come home\r\nat night, carrying under their arms a sirloin of beef, a joint of veal, or\r\na leg of mutton, not forgetting to hang a bottle of wine to their belt,\r\nand, on entering the court, they throw aside their crutches, resume their\r\nhealthy and lusty appearance, and, in imitation of the ancient\r\nBacchanalian revelries, dance all kinds of dances with their trophies in\r\ntheir hands, whilst the host is preparing their suppers. Can there be a\r\ngreater _miracle_ than is to be seen in this court, where the maimed walk\r\nupright?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379.--_Cour des Miracles_ of Paris. Talebot the\r\nHunchback, a celebrated Scamp during the Seventeenth Century.--From an old\r\nEngraving in the Collection of Engravings in the National Library of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nIn Paris there were several _Cours des Miracles_, but the most celebrated\r\nwas that which, from the time of Sauval, the singular historian of the\r\n\"Antiquities of Paris,\" to the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\npreserved this generic name _par excellence_, and which exists to this day\r\n(Fig. 379). He says, \"It is a place of considerable size, and is in an\r\nunhealthy, muddy, and irregular blind alley. Formerly it was situated on\r\nthe outskirts of Paris, now it is in one of the worst built, dirtiest, and\r\nmost out-of-the-way quarters of the town, between the Rue Montorgueil, the\r\nconvent of the Filles-Dieu, and the Rue Neuve-Saint-Sauveur. To get there\r\none must wander through narrow, close, and by-streets; and in order to\r\nenter it, one must descend a somewhat winding and rugged declivity. In\r\nthis place I found a mud house, half buried, very shaky from old age and\r\nrottenness, and only eight mètres square; but in which, nevertheless,\r\nsome fifty families are living, who have the charge of a large number of\r\nchildren, many of whom are stolen or illegitimate.... I was assured that\r\nupwards of five hundred large families occupy that and other houses\r\nadjoining.... Large as this court is, it was formerly even bigger....\r\nHere, without any care for the future, every one enjoys the present; and\r\neats in the evening what he has earned during the day with so much\r\ntrouble, and often with so many blows; for it is one of the fundamental\r\nrules of the Cour des Miracles never to lay by anything for the morrow.\r\nEvery one who lives there indulges in the utmost licentiousness; both\r\nreligion and law are utterly ignored.... It is true that outwardly they\r\nappear to acknowledge a God; for they have set up in a niche an image of\r\nGod the Father, which they have stolen from some church, and before which\r\nthey come daily to offer up certain prayers; but this is only because they\r\nsuperstitiously imagine that by this means they are released from the\r\nnecessity of performing the duties of Christians to their pastor and their\r\nparish, and are even absolved from the sin of entering a church for the\r\npurpose of robbery and purse-cutting.\"\r\n\r\nParis, the capital of the kingdom of rogues, was not the only town which\r\npossessed a Cour des Miracles, for we find here and there, especially at\r\nLyons and Bordeaux, some traces of these privileged resorts of rogues and\r\nthieves, which then flourished under the sceptre of the Grand Coesre.\r\nSauval states, on the testimony of people worthy of credit, that at\r\nSainte-Anne d'Auray, the most holy place of pilgrimage in Brittany, under\r\nthe superintendence of the order of reformed Carmelite friars, there was a\r\nlarge field called the _Rogue's Field_. This was covered with mud huts;\r\nand here the Grand Coesre resorted annually on the principal solemn\r\nfestivals, with his officers and subjects, in order \"to hold his council\r\nof state,\" that is to say, in order to settle and arrange respecting\r\nrobbery. At these _state_ meetings, which were not always held at\r\nSainte-Anne d'Auray, all the subjects of the Grand Coesre were present,\r\nand paid homage to their lord and master. Some came and paid him the\r\ntribute which was required of them by the statutes of the craft; others\r\nrendered him an account of what they had done, and what they had earned\r\nduring the year. When they had executed their work badly, he ordered them\r\nto be punished, either corporally or pecuniarily, according to the gravity\r\nof their offences. When he had not himself properly governed his people,\r\nhe was dethroned, and a successor was appointed by acclamation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.--Beggar playing the Fiddle, and his Wife\r\naccompanying him with the Bones.--From an old Engraving of the Seventeenth\r\nCentury.]\r\n\r\nAt these assemblies, as well as in the Cours des Miracles, French was not\r\nspoken, but a strange and artificial language was used called _jargon_,\r\n_langue matoise, narquois_, &c. This language, which is still in use under\r\nthe name of _argot_, or slang, had for the most part been borrowed from\r\nthe jargon or slang of the lower orders. To a considerable extent,\r\naccording to the learned philologist of this mysterious language, M.\r\nFrancisque Michel, it was composed of French words lengthened or\r\nabbreviated; of proverbial expressions; of words expressing the symbols of\r\nthings instead of the things themselves; of terms either intentionally or\r\nunintentionally altered from their true meaning; and of words which\r\nresembled other words in sound, but which had not the same signification.\r\nThus, for mouth, they said _pantière_, from _pain_ (bread), which they put\r\ninto it; the arms were _lyans_ (binders); an ox was a _cornant_ (horned);\r\na purse, a _fouille_, or _fouillouse_; a cock, a _horloge_, or timepiece;\r\nthe legs, _des quilles_ (nine-pins); a sou, a _rond_, or round thing; the\r\neyes, _des luisants_ (sparklers), &c. In jargon several words were also\r\ntaken from the ancient language of the gipsies, which testifies to the\r\npart which these vagabonds played in the formation of the Argotic\r\ncommunity. For example, a shirt was called _lime_; a chambermaid,\r\n_limogère;_ sheets, _limans_--words all derived from the gipsy word\r\n_lima_, a shirt: they called an écu, a _rusquin_ or _rougesme_, from\r\n_rujia_, the common word for money; a rich man, _rupin_; a house, _turne_;\r\na knife, _chourin_, from _rup, turna_, and _chori_, which, in the gipsy\r\ntongue, mean respectively silver, castle, and knife.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have related about rogues and the Cours des Miracles, one\r\nmight perhaps be tempted to suppose that France was specially privileged;\r\nbut it was not so, for Italy was far worse in this respect. The rogues\r\nwere called by the Italians _bianti_, or _ceretani_, and were subdivided\r\ninto more than forty classes, the various characteristics of which have\r\nbeen described by a certain Rafael Frianoro. It is not necessary to state\r\nthat the analogue of more than one of these classes is to be found in the\r\nshort description we have given of the Argotic kingdom in France. We will\r\ntherefore only mention those which were more especially Italian. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that in the southern countries, where religions\r\nsuperstition was more marked than elsewhere, the numerous family of rogues\r\nhad no difficulty in practising every description of imposture, inasmuch\r\nas they trusted to the various manifestations of religions feeling to\r\neffect their purposes. Thus the _affrati_, in order to obtain more alms\r\nand offerings, went about in the garb of monks and priests, even saying\r\nmass, and pretending that it was the first time they had exercised their\r\nsacred office. So the _morghigeri_ walked behind a donkey, carrying a bell\r\nand a lamp, with their string of beads in their hands, and asking how they\r\nwere to pay for the bell, which they were always \"just going to buy.\" The\r\n_felsi_ pretended that they were divinely inspired and endowed with the\r\ngift of second sight, and announced that there were hidden treasures in\r\ncertain houses under the guardianship of evil spirits. They asserted that\r\nthese treasures could not be discovered without danger, except by means of\r\nfastings and offerings, which they and their brethren could alone make, in\r\nconsideration of which they entered into a bargain, and received a certain\r\nsum of money from the owners. The _accatosi_ deserve mention on account of\r\nthe cleverness with which they contrived to assume the appearance of\r\ncaptives recently escaped from slavery. Shaking the chains with which they\r\nsaid they had been bound, jabbering unintelligible words, telling\r\nheart-rending tales of their sufferings and privations, and showing the\r\nmarks of blows which they had received, they went on their knees, begging\r\nfor money that they might buy off their brethren or their friends, whom\r\nthey said they had left in the hands of the Saracens or the Turks, We must\r\nmention, also, the _allacrimanti_, or weepers, who owed their name to the\r\nfacility which they possessed of shedding tears at will; and the\r\n_testatori_, who, pretending to be seriously ill and about to die,\r\nextorted money from all those to whom they promised to leave their\r\nfortunes, though, of course, they had not a son to leave behind them. We\r\nmust not forget the _protobianti_ (master rogues), who made no scruple of\r\nexciting compassion from their own comrades (Fig. 381), nor the\r\n_vergognosi_, who, notwithstanding their poverty, wished to be thought\r\nrich, and considered that assistance was due to them from the mere fact of\r\ntheir being noble. We must here conclude, for it would occupy too much\r\ntime to go through the list of these Italian vagabonds. As for the German\r\n(Figs. 382 and 383), Spanish, and English rogues, we may simply remark\r\nthat no type exists among them which is not to be met with amongst the\r\nArgotiers of France or the Bianti of Italy. In giving a description,\r\ntherefore, of the mendicity practised in these two countries during the\r\nMiddle Ages, we are sure to be representing what it was in other parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381.--Italian Beggar.--From an Engraving by Callot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 382 and 383.--German Beggars.--Fac-simile of a\r\nWoodcut in the \"Cosmographie Universelle\" of Munster: in folio, Basle,\r\n1552.]\r\n\r\nThe history of regular robbers and highwaymen during this long period is\r\nmore difficult to describe; it contains only disconnected anecdotes of a\r\nmore or less interesting character. It is probable, moreover, that robbers\r\ndid not always commit their depredations singly, and that they early\r\nunderstood the advantages of associating together. The _Tafurs_, or\r\n_Halegrins_, whom we notice as followers of Godefroy de Bouillon at the\r\ntime of the Crusades, towards the end of the eleventh century, were\r\nterribly bad characters, and are actually accused by contemporary writers\r\nof violating tombs, and of living on human flesh. On this account they\r\nwere looked upon with the utmost horror by the infidels, who dreaded more\r\ntheir savage ferocity than the valour of the Crusaders. The latter even,\r\nwho had these hordes of Tafurs under their command, were not without\r\nconsiderable mistrust of them, and when, during their march through\r\nHungary, under the protection of the cross, these miscreants committed\r\ndepredations, Godefroy de Bouillion was obliged to ask pardon for them\r\nfrom the king of that country.\r\n\r\nAn ancient poet has handed down to us a story in verse setting forth the\r\nexploits of Eustace the monk, who, after having thrown aside his frock,\r\nembraced the life of a robber, and only abandoned it to become Admiral of\r\nFrance under Philip Augustus. He was killed before Sandwich, in 1217. We\r\nhave satisfactory proof that as early as the thirteenth century sharpers\r\nwere very expert masters of their trade, for the ingenious and amusing\r\ntricks of which they were guilty are quite equal to the most skilled of\r\nthose now recorded in our police reports. In the two following centuries\r\nthe science of the _pince_ and of the _croc_ (pincers and hook), as it was\r\nthen called, alone made progress, and Pathelin (a character in comedy, and\r\nan incomparable type of craft and dishonesty) never lacked disciples any\r\nmore than Villon did imitators. We know that this charming poet, who was\r\nat the same time a most expert thief, narrowly escaped hanging on two\r\noccasions. His contemporaries attributed to him a poem of twelve hundred\r\nverses, entitled \"Les Repues Franches,\" in which are described the methods\r\nin use among his companions for procuring wine, bread, meat, and fish,\r\nwithout having to pay for them. They form a series of interesting\r\nstories, the moral of which is to be gathered from the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"C'est bien, disné, quand on eschappe\r\n  Sans desbourcer pas ung denier,\r\n  Et dire adieu an tavernier,\r\n  En torchant son nez à la nappe.\"\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this doggrel, which is somewhat broad, may be rendered--\"He\r\ndines well who escapes without paying a penny, and who bids farewell to\r\nthe innkeeper by wiping his nose on the tablecloth.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side with this poem of Yillon we ought to cite one of a later\r\nperiod--\"La Légende de Maître Faifeu,\" versified by Charles Boudigné. This\r\nFaifeu was a kind of Villon of Anjou, who excelled in all kinds of\r\nrascality, and who might possibly have taught it even to the gipsies\r\nthemselves. The character of Panurge, in the \"Pantagruel,\" is no other\r\nthan the type of Faifeu, immortalised by the genius of Rabelais. We must\r\nalso mention one of the pamphlets of Guillaume Bouchet, written towards\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century, which gives a very amusing account of\r\nthieves of every description, and also \"L'Histoire Générale des Larrons,\"\r\nin which are related numerous wonderful tales of murders, robberies, and\r\nother atrocities, which made our admiring ancestors well acquainted with\r\nthe heroes of the Grève and of Montfaucon. It must not be supposed that in\r\nthose days the life of a robber who pursued his occupation with any degree\r\nof industry and skill was unattended with danger, for the most harmless\r\ncut-purses were hung without mercy whenever they were caught; the fear,\r\nhowever, of this fate did not prevent the _Enfants de la Matte_ from\r\nperforming wonders.\r\n\r\nBrantôme relates that King Charles IX. had the curiosity to wish to \"know\r\nhow the cut-purses performed their arts with so much skill and dexterity,\"\r\nand begged Captain La Chambre to introduce to him, on the occasion of a\r\nbanquet and a ball, the cleverest cut-purses, giving them full liberty to\r\nexhibit their skill. The captain went to the Cours des Miracles and\r\nfetched ten of the most expert of these thieves, whom he presented to the\r\nKing. Charles, \"after the dinner and the ball had taken place, wished to\r\nsee all the plunder, and found that they had absolutely earned three\r\nthousand écus, either in money from purses, or in precious stones, pearls,\r\nor other jewels; some of the guests even lost their cloaks, at which the\r\nKing thought he should die of laughter.\" The King allowed them to keep\r\nwhat they had thus earned at the expense of his guests; but he forbad them\r\n\"to continue this sort of life,\" under penalty of being hung, and he had\r\nthem enrolled in the army, in order to recompense them for their clever\r\nfeats. We may safely assert that they made but indifferent soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384.--The Exhibitor of strange Animals (Twelfth\r\nCentury Manuscript, Royal Library of Brussels).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCeremonials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Origin of Modern Ceremonial.--Uncertainty of French Ceremonial up to the\r\n  End of the Sixteenth Century.--Consecration of the Kings of\r\n  France.--Coronation of the Emperors of Germany.--Consecration of the\r\n  Doges of Venice.--Marriage of the Doge with the Sea.--State Entries of\r\n  Sovereigns.--An Account of the Entry of Isabel of Bavaria into\r\n  Paris.--Seats of Justice.--Visits of Ceremony between Persons of\r\n  rank.--Mourning.--Social Courtesies.--Popular Demonstrations and\r\n  National Commemorations.--New Year's Day.--Local Festivals.--_Vins\r\n  d'Honneur._--Processions of Trades.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough society during the Middle Ages was, as a whole, closely cemented\r\ntogether, being animated by the same sentiments and imbued with the same\r\nspirit, it was divided, as we have already stated, into three great\r\nclasses, namely, the clergy, the nobility, and the _liers-état._ These\r\nclasses, each of which formed a distinct body within the State, carried on\r\nan existence peculiar to itself, and presented in its collective capacity\r\na separate individuality. Hence there was a distinct ceremonial for each\r\nclass. We will not attempt to give in detail the innumerable laws of these\r\nthree kinds of ceremonial; our attention will be directed solely to their\r\nmost characteristic customs, and to their most remarkable and interesting\r\naspects taken as a whole. We must altogether lay aside matters relating\r\nspecially to ceremonies of a purely religions character, as they are\r\nconnected more or less with the traditions and customs of the Church, and\r\nbelong to quite a distinct order of things.\r\n\r\n\"When the Germans, and especially the Franks,\" says the learned\r\npaleographer Vallet de Viriville, \"had succeeded in establishing their\r\nown rule in place of that of the Romans, these almost savage nations, and\r\nthe barbarian chiefs who were at their head under the title of kings,\r\nnecessarily borrowed more or less the refined practices relating to\r\nceremonial possessed by the people whom they had conquered. The elevation\r\nof the elected chief or king on the shield and the solemn taking of arms\r\nin the midst of the tribe seem to be the only traces of public ceremonies\r\nwhich we can discover among the Grermans. The marvellous display and the\r\nimposing splendour of the political hierarchy of the Roman Empire,\r\nespecially in its outward arrangements, must have astonished the minds of\r\nthese uncultivated people. Thus we find the Frank kings becoming\r\nimmediately after a victory the simple and clumsy imitators of the\r\ncivilisation which they had broken up.\" Clovis on returning to Tours in\r\n507, after having defeated Alaric, received the titles of _Patrician_ and\r\n_Consul_ from the Emperor Anastasius, and bedecked himself with the\r\npurple, the chlamys, and the diadem. The same principle of imitation was\r\nafterwards exhibited in the internal and external court ceremonial, in\r\nproportion as it became developed in the royal person. Charlemagne, who\r\naimed at everything which could adorn and add strength to a new monarchy,\r\nestablished a regular method for the general and special administration of\r\nhis empire, as also for the internal arrangement and discipline of his\r\npalace. We have already referred to this twofold organization (_vide_\r\nchapters on Private Life and on Food), but we may here remark that,\r\nnotwithstanding these ancient tendencies to the creation of a fixed\r\nceremonial, the trifling rules which made etiquette a science and a law,\r\nwere introduced by degrees, and have only very recently been established\r\namongst us.\r\n\r\nIn 1385, when King Charles VI. married the notorious Isabel of Bavaria,\r\nthen scarcely fourteen years of age, he desired to arrange for her a\r\nmagnificent entry into Paris, the pomp and brilliancy of which should be\r\nconsistent with the rank and illustrious descent of his young bride. He\r\ntherefore begged the old Queen Blanche, widow of Philippe de Valois, to\r\npreside over the ceremony, and to have it conducted according to the\r\ncustom of olden times. She was consequently obliged, in the absence of any\r\nfixed rules on the subject, to consult the official records,--that is to\r\nsay, the \"Chronique du Monastère de Saint-Denis.\" The first embodiment of\r\nrules relating to these matters in use among the nobility, which had\r\nappeared in France under the title of \"Honneurs de la Cour,\" only goes\r\nback to the end of the fifteenth century. It appears, however, that even\r\nthen this was not generally admitted among the nobility as the basis of\r\nceremonial, for in 1548 we find that nothing had been definitely settled.\r\nThis is evident from the fact that when King Henri III. desired to know\r\nthe rank and order of precedence of the princes of the royal blood, both\r\ndukes and counts--as also that of the other princes, the barons, the\r\nnobles of the kingdom, the constables, the marshals of France and the\r\nadmirals, and what position they had held on great public occasions during\r\nthe reigns of his predecessors--he commissioned Jean du Tillet, the civil\r\nregistrar of the Parliament of Paris, to search among the royal archives\r\nfor the various authentic documents which might throw light on this\r\nquestion, and serve as a precedent for the future. In fact, it was Henri\r\nIII. who, in 1585, created the office of Grand Master of the Ceremonies of\r\nFrance, entrusting it to Guillaume Pot, a noble of Rhodes, which office\r\nfor many generations remained hereditary in his family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385.--Herald (Fourteenth Century).--From a Miniature\r\nin the \"Chroniques de Saint-Denis\" (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nNevertheless the question of ceremonial, and especially that of\r\nprecedence, had already more than once occupied the attention of\r\nsovereigns, not only within their own states, but also in relation to\r\ndiplomatic matters. The meetings of councils, at which the ambassadors of\r\nall the Christian Powers, with the delegates of the Catholic Church, were\r\nassembled, did not fail to bring this subject up for decision. Pope\r\nJulius II. in 1504 instructed Pierre de Crassis, his Master of the\r\nCeremonies, to publish a decree, determining the rank to be taken by the\r\nvarious sovereigns of Europe or by their representatives; but we should\r\nadd that this Papal decree never received the sanction of the parties\r\ninterested, and that the question of precedence, even at the most\r\nunimportant public ceremonies, was during the whole of the Middle Ages a\r\nperpetual source of litigation in courts of law, and of quarrels which too\r\noften ended in bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIt is right that we should place at the head of political ceremonies those\r\nhaving reference to the coronation of sovereigns, which were not only\r\npolitical, but owed their supreme importance and dignity to the necessary\r\nintervention of ecclesiastical authority. We will therefore first speak of\r\nthe consecration and coronation of the kings of France.\r\n\r\nPépin le Bref, son of Charles Martel and founder of the second dynasty,\r\nwas the first of the French kings who was consecrated by the religions\r\nrite of anointing. But its mode of administration for a long period\r\nunderwent numerous changes, before becoming established by a definite law.\r\nThus Pépin, after having been first consecrated in 752 in the Cathedral of\r\nBoissons, by the Archbishop of Mayence, was again consecrated with his two\r\nsons Charlemagne and Carloman, in 753, in the Abbey of St. Denis, by Pope\r\nStephen III. Charlemagne was twice anointed by the Sovereign Pontiff,\r\nfirst as King of Lombardy, and then as Emperor. Louis le Débonnaire, his\r\nimmediate successor, was consecrated at Rheims by Pope Stephen IV. in 816.\r\nIn 877 Louis le Bègue received unction and the sceptre, at Compiègne, at\r\nthe hands of the Archbishop of Rheims. Charles le Simple in 893, and\r\nRobert I. in 922, were consecrated and crowned at Rheims; but the\r\ncoronation of Raoul, in 923, was celebrated in the Abbey of St. Médard de\r\nSoissons, and that of Louis d'Outremer, in 936, at Laon. From the\r\naccession of King Lothaire to that of Louis VI. (called Le Gros), the\r\nconsecration of the kings of France sometimes took place in the\r\nmetropolitan church of Rheims, and sometimes in other churches, but more\r\nfrequently in the former. Louis VI. having been consecrated in the\r\nCathedral of Orleans, the clergy of Rheims appealed against this supposed\r\ninfraction of custom and their own special privileges. A long discussion\r\ntook place, in which were brought forward the titles which the Church of\r\nRheims possessed subsequently to the reign of Clovis to the exclusive\r\nhonour of having kings consecrated in it; and King Louis le Jeune, son of\r\nLouis le Gros, who was himself consecrated at Rheims, promulgated a\r\nspecial decree on this question, in anticipation of the consecration of\r\nhis son, Philippe Auguste. This decree finally settled the rights of this\r\nancient church, and at the same time defined the order which was to be\r\nobserved in future at the ceremony of consecration. From that date, down\r\nto the end of the reign of the Bourbons of the elder line, kings were\r\ninvariably consecrated, according to legal rite, in the metropolitan\r\nchurch of Rheims, with the exception of Henry IV., who was crowned at\r\nChartres by the bishop of that town, on account of the civil wars which\r\nthen divided his kingdom, and caused the gates of Rheims to be closed\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386.--Coronation of Charlemagne.--Fac-simile of a\r\nMiniature in the \"Chroniques de Saint-Denis,\" Manuscript of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nThe consecration of the kings of France always took place on a Sunday. On\r\nthe previous day, at the conclusion of evening prayers, the custody of the\r\ncathedral devolved upon certain royal officers, assisted by the ordinary\r\nofficials. During the evening the monarch came to the church for devotion,\r\nand \"according to his religions feelings, to pass part of the night in\r\nprayer,\" an act which was called _la veillée des armes_. A large platform,\r\nsurmounted by a throne, was erected between the chancel and the great\r\nnave. Upon this assembled, besides the King and his officers of State,\r\ntwelve ecclesiastical peers, together with those prelates whom the King\r\nmight be pleased to invite, and six lay peers, with other officers or\r\nnobles. At daybreak, the King sent a deputation of barons to the Abbey of\r\nSt. Remi for the holy vial, which was a small glass vessel called\r\n_ampoule_, from the Latin word _ampulla_, containing the holy oil to be\r\nused at the royal anointing. According to tradition, this vial was brought\r\nfrom heaven by a dove at the time of the consecration of Clovis. Four of\r\nthe nobles remained as hostages at the abbey during the time that the\r\nAbbot of St. Remi, followed by his monks and escorted by the barons, went\r\nin procession to the cathedral to place the sacred vessel upon the altar.\r\nThe abbot of St. Denis in France had in a similar manner to bring from\r\nRheims with great pomp, and deposit by the side of the holy vial, the\r\nroyal insignia, which were kept in the treasury of his monastery, and had\r\nbeen there since the reign of Charlemagne. They consisted of the crown,\r\nthe sword sheathed, the golden spurs, the gilt sceptre, the rod adorned\r\nwith an ivory handle in the form of a hand, the sandals of blue silk,\r\nembroidered with fleur de lis, the chasuble or _dalmatique_, and the\r\n_surcot_, or royal mantle, in the shape of a cape without a hood. The\r\nKing, immediately on rising from his bed, entered the cathedral, and\r\nforthwith took oath to maintain the Catholio faith and the privileges of\r\nthe Church, and to dispense good and impartial justice to his subjects. He\r\nthen walked to the foot of the altar, and divested himself of part of his\r\ndress, having his head bare, and wearing a tunic with openings on the\r\nchest, on the shoulders, at the elbows, and in the middle of the back;\r\nthese openings were closed by means of silver aigulets. The Archbishop of\r\nRheims then drew the sword from the scabbard and handed it to the King,\r\nwho passed it to the principal officer in attendance. The prelate then\r\nproceeded with the religious part of the ceremony of consecration, and\r\ntaking a drop of the miraculous oil out of the holy vial by means of a\r\ngold needle, he mixed it with the holy oil from his own church. This being\r\ndone, and sitting in the posture of consecration, he anointed the King,\r\nwho was kneeling before him, in five different parts of the body, namely,\r\non the forehead, on the breast, on the back, on the shoulders, and on the\r\njoints of the arms. After this the King rose up, and with the assistance\r\nof his officers, put on his royal robes. The Archbishop handed to him\r\nsuccessively the ring, the sceptre, and the rod of justice, and lastly\r\nplaced the crown on his head. At this moment the twelve peers formed\r\nthemselves into a group, the lay peers being in the first rank,\r\nimmediately around the sovereign, and raising their hands to the crown,\r\nthey held it for a moment, and then they conducted the King to the throne.\r\nThe consecrating prelate, putting down his mitre, then knelt at the feet\r\nof the monarch and took the oath of allegiance, his example being followed\r\nby the other peers and their vassals who were in attendance. At the same\r\ntime, the cry of \"_Vive le Roi_!\" uttered by the archbishop, was repeated\r\nthree times outside the cathedral by the heralds-at-arms, who shouted it\r\nto the assembled multitude. The latter replied, \"_Noel! Noel! Noel!_\" and\r\nscrambled for the small pieces of money thrown to them by the officers,\r\nwho at the same time cried out, \"_Largesse, largesse aux manants_!\" Every\r\npart of this ceremony was accompanied by benedictions and prayers, the\r\nform of which was read out of the consecration service as ordered by the\r\nbishop, and the proceedings terminated by the return of the civil and\r\nreligious procession which had composed the _cortège_. When the sovereign\r\nwas married, his wife participated with him in the honours of the\r\nconsecration, the symbolical investiture, and the coronation; but she only\r\npartook of the homage rendered to the King to a limited degree, which was\r\nmeant to imply that the Queen had a less extended authority and a less\r\nexalted rank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387.--Dalmatica and Sandals of Charlemagne, Insignia\r\nof the Kings of France at their Coronation, preserved in the Treasury of\r\nthe Abbey of St. Denis.]\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies which accompanied the accessions of the emperors of Germany\r\n(Fig. 388) are equally interesting, and were settled by a decree which the\r\nEmperor Charles IX. promulgated in 1356, at the Diet of Nuremberg.\r\nAccording to the terms of this decree--which is still preserved among the\r\narchives of Frankfort-on-the-Main, and which is known as the _bulle d'or_,\r\nor golden bull, from the fact of its bearing a seal of pure gold--on the\r\ndeath of an emperor, the Archbishop of Mayence summoned, for an appointed\r\nday, the Prince Electors of the Empire, who, during the whole course of\r\nthe Middle Ages, remained seven in number, \"in honour,\" says the bull, \"of\r\nthe seven candlesticks mentioned in the Apocalypse.\" These Electors--who\r\noccupied the same position near the Emperor that the twelve peers did in\r\nrelation to the King of France--were the Archbishops of Mayence, of\r\nTrèves, and of Cologne, the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the\r\nRhine, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg. On the\r\nappointed day, the mass of the Holy Spirit was duly solemnized in the\r\nChurch of St. Bartholomew of Frankfort, a town in which not only the\r\nelection of the Emperor, but also his coronation, almost always took\r\nplace, though one might have supposed that Aix-la-Chapelle would have been\r\nselected for such ceremonies. The Electors attended, and after the service\r\nwas concluded, they retired to the sacristy of the church, accompanied by\r\ntheir officers and secretaries, They had thirty days for deliberation, but\r\nbeyond that period they were not allowed \"to eat bread or drink water\"\r\nuntil they had agreed, at least by a majority, to give _a temporal chief\r\nto the Christian people, that is to say, a King of the Romans, who should\r\nin due time be promoted to be Emperor_, The newly-elected prince was, in\r\nfact, at first simply _King of the Romans_, and this title was often borne\r\nby persons who were merely nominated for the office by the voice of the\r\nElectors, or by political combinations. In order to be promoted to the\r\nfull measure of power and authority, the King of the Romans had to receive\r\nboth religions consecration and the crown. The ceremonies adopted at this\r\nsolemnity were very analogous to those used at the consecrations of the\r\nkings of France, as well as to those of installation of all Christian\r\nprinces. The service was celebrated by the Archbishop of Cologne, who\r\nplaced the crown on the head of the sovereign-elect, whom he consecrated\r\nEmperor. The symbols of his authority were handed to him by the Electors,\r\nand then he was proclaimed, \"_Cæsar, most sacred, ever august Majesty,\r\nEmperor, of the Holy Roman Empire of the nation of Germany_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388.--Costume of Emperors at their Coronation since\r\nthe Time of Charlemagne.--From an Engraving in a Work entitled \"Insignia\r\nSacre Majistatis Cæsarum Principum.\" Frankfort, 1579, in folio.]\r\n\r\nThe imperial _cortége_ then came out from the Church of St. Bartholomew,\r\nand went through the town, halting at the town-hall (called the _Roemer_,\r\nin commemoration of the noble name of Rome), where a splendid banquet,\r\nprepared in the _Kaysersaal_ (hall of the Caesars), awaited the principal\r\nperformers in this august ceremony.\r\n\r\nAt the moment that the Emperor set foot on the threshold of the Roemer,\r\nthe Elector of Saxony, Chief Marshal of the Empire, on horseback, galloped\r\nat full speed towards a heap of oats which was piled up in the middle of\r\nthe square. Holding in one hand a silver measure, and in the other a\r\nscraper of the same metal, each of which weighed six marks, he filled the\r\nmeasure with oats, levelled it with the scraper, and handed it over to the\r\nhereditary marshal. The rest of the heap was noisily scrambled for by the\r\npeople who had been witnesses of this allegorical performance. Then the\r\nCount Palatine, as chief seneschal, proceeded to perform his part in the\r\nceremony, which consisted of placing before the Emperor, who was sitting\r\nat table, four silver dishes, each weighing three marks. The King of\r\nBohemia, as chief butler, handed to the monarch wine and water in a silver\r\ncup weighing twelve marks; and then the Margrave of Magdeburg presented to\r\nhim a silver basin of the same weight for washing his hands. The other\r\nthree Electors, or arch-chancellors, provided at their own expense the\r\nsilver baton, weighing twelve marks, suspended to which one of them\r\ncarried the seals of the empire. Lastly, the Emperor, and with him the\r\nEmpress if he was married, the princes, and the Electors, sat down to a\r\nbanquet at separate tables, and were waited upon by their respective\r\nofficers. On another table or stage were placed the Imperial insignia. The\r\nceremony was concluded outside by public rejoicings: fountains were set to\r\nplay; wine, beer, and other beverages were distributed; gigantic bonfires\r\nwere made, at which whole oxen were roasted; refreshment tables were set\r\nout in the open air, at which any one might sit down and partake, and, in\r\na word, every bounty as well as every amusement was provided. In this way\r\nfor centuries public fêtes were celebrated on these occasions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389.--Imperial Procession.--From an Engraving of the\r\n\"Solemn Entry of Charles V. and Clement VII. into Bologna,\" by L. de\r\nCranach, from a Fresco by Brusasorci, of Verona.]\r\n\r\nThe doges of Venice, as well as the emperors of Germany, and some other\r\nheads of states, differed from other Christian sovereigns in this respect,\r\nthat, instead of holding their high office by hereditary or divine right,\r\nthey were installed therein by election. At Venice, a conclave, consisting\r\nof forty electors, appointed by a much more numerous body of men of high\r\nposition, elected the Doge, or president of _the most serene Republic_.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when Laurent Tiepolo, immediately after his election in 1268,\r\nwas spontaneously carried in triumph by the Venetian sailors, it became\r\nthe custom for a similar ovation to take place in honour of any\r\nnewly-elected doge. In order to do this, the workmen of the harbour had\r\nthe new Doge seated in a splendid palanquin, and carried him on their\r\nshoulders in great pomp round the Piazza San Marco. But another still more\r\ncharacteristic ceremony distinguished this magisterial election. On\r\nAscension Day, the Doge, entering a magnificent galley, called the\r\n_Bucentaur_, which was elegantly equipped, and resplendent with gold and\r\nprecious stuffs, crossed the Grand Canal, went outside the town, and\r\nproceeded in the midst of a nautical _cortége_, escorted by bands of\r\nmusic, to the distance of about a league from the town on the Adriatic\r\nGulf. Then the Patriarch of Venice gave his blessing to the sea, and the\r\nDoge, taking the helm, threw a gold ring into the water, saying, \"O sea! I\r\nespouse thee in the name, and in token, of our true and perpetual\r\nsovereignty.\" Immediately the waters were strewed with flowers, and the\r\nshouts of joy, and the clapping of hands of the crowd, were intermingled\r\nwith the strains of instruments of music of all sorts, whilst the glorious\r\nsky of Venice smiled on the poetic scene.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the principal ceremonies of the Middle Ages acquired,\r\nfrom various accessory and local circumstances, a character of grandeur\r\nwell fitted to impress the minds of the populace. On these memorable\r\noccasions the exhibition of some historical memorial, of certain\r\ntraditional symbols, of certain relics, &c., brought to the recollection\r\nthe most celebrated events in national history--events already possessing\r\nthe prestige of antiquity as well as the veneration of the people. Thus,\r\nas a memorial of the consecration of the kings of Hungary, the actual\r\ncrown of holy King Stephen was used; at the consecration of the kings of\r\nEngland, the actual chair of Edward the Confessor was used; at the\r\nconsecration of the emperors of Germany, the imperial insignia actually\r\nused by Charlemagne formed part of the display; at the consecration of the\r\nkings of France at a certain period, the hand of justice of St. Louis,\r\nwhich has been before alluded to, was produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390.--Standards of the Church and the Empire.--Reduced\r\nfrom an Engraving of the \"Entry of Charles V. and Clement VII. into\r\nBologna,\" by Lucas de Cranach, from a Fresco by Brusasorci, of Verona.]\r\n\r\nAfter their consecration by the Church and by the spiritual power, the\r\nsovereigns had simply to take actual possession of their dominions, and,\r\nso to speak, of their subjects. This positive act of sovereignty was often\r\naccompanied by another class of ceremonies, called _joyous entry_, or\r\n_public entry._ These entries, of which numerous accounts have been handed\r\ndown to us by historians, and which for the most part were very varied in\r\ncharacter, naturally took place in the capital city. We will limit\r\nourselves to transcribing the account given by the ancient chronicler,\r\nJuvenal des Ursins, of the entry into Paris of Queen Isabel of Bavaria,\r\nwife of Charles VI., which was a curious specimen of the public fêtes of\r\nthis kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391.--Grand Procession of the Doge, Venice (Sixteenth\r\nCentury).--Reduced from one of fourteen Engravings representing this\r\nCeremony, designed and engraved by J. Amman.]\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1389, the King was desirous that the Queen should make a\r\npublic entry into Paris, and this he made known to the inhabitants, in\r\norder that they should make preparations for it. And there were at each\r\ncross roads divers _histoires_ (historical representations, pictures, or\r\ntableaux vivants), and fountains sending forth water, wine, and milk. The\r\npeople of Paris in great numbers went out to meet the Queen, with the\r\nProvost of the Merchants, crying '_Noel!_' The bridge by which she passed\r\nwas covered with blue taffeta, embroidered with golden fleurs-de-lys. A\r\nman of light weight, dressed in the guise of an angel, came down, by means\r\nof some well-constructed machinery, from one of the towers of Notre-Dame,\r\nto the said bridge through an opening in the said blue taffeta, at the\r\nmoment when the Queen was passing, and placed a beautiful crown on her\r\nhead. After he had done this, he withdrew through the said opening by the\r\nsame means, and thus appeared as if he were returning to the skies of his\r\nown accord. Before the Grand Chastelet there was a splendid court adorned\r\nwith azure tapestry, which was intended to be a representation of the\r\n_lit-de-justice,_ and it was very large and richly decorated. In the\r\nmiddle of it was a very large pure white artificial stag, its horns gilt,\r\nand its neck encircled with a crown of gold. It was so ingeniously\r\nconstructed that its eyes, horns, mouth, and all its limbs, were put in\r\nmotion by a man who was secreted within its body. Hanging to its neck were\r\nthe King's arms--that is to say, three gold fleur-de-lys on an azure\r\nshield.... Near the stag there was a large sword, beautiful and bright,\r\nunsheathed; and when the Queen passed, the stag was made to take the sword\r\nin the right fore-foot, to hold it out straight, and to brandish it. It\r\nwas reported to the King that the said preparations were made, and he said\r\nto Savoisy, who was one of those nearest to him, 'Savoisy, I earnestly\r\nentreat thee to mount a good horse, and I will ride behind thee, and we\r\nwill so dress ourselves that no one will know us, and let us go and see\r\nthe entry of my wife.' And, although Savoisy did all he could to dissuade\r\nhim, the King insisted, and ordered that it should be done. So Savoisy did\r\nwhat the King had ordered, and disguised himself as well as he could, and\r\nmounted on a powerful horse with the King behind him. They went through\r\nthe town, and managed so as to reach the Chastelet at the time the Queen\r\nwas passing. There was a great crowd, and Savoisy placed himself as near\r\nas he could, and there were sergeants on all sides with thick birch wands,\r\nwho, in order to prevent the crowd from pressing upon and injuring the\r\ncourt where the stag was, hit away with their wands as hard as they could.\r\nSavoisy struggled continually to get nearer and nearer, and the sergeants,\r\nwho neither knew the King nor Savoisy, struck away at them, and the King\r\nreceived several very hard and well-directed blows on the shoulders. In\r\nthe evening, in the presence of the ladies, the matter was talked over,\r\nand they began to joke about it, and even the King himself laughed at the\r\nblows he had received. The Queen on her entry was seated on a litter, and\r\nvery magnificently dressed, as were also the ladies and maids of honour.\r\nIt was indeed a splendid sight; and if any one wished to describe the\r\ndresses of the ladies, of the knights and squires, and of those who\r\nescorted the Queen, it would take a long time to do so. After supper,\r\nsinging and dancing commenced, which continued until daylight. The next\r\nday there were tournaments and other sports\" (Fig. 392).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entry of Charles the Seventh into Paris\r\n\r\nA miniature from _Monstrelet the Chronicles_ in the Bibl. nat. de Paris,\r\nno 20,861 Costumes of the Sixteenth century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392.--Tournaments in honour of the Entry of Queen\r\nIsabel into Paris--From a Miniature in the \"Chroniques\" of Froissart,\r\nManuscript of the Fifteenth Century (National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393.--Seat of Justice, held by King Philippe de Valois,\r\non the 8th April, 1332, for the Trial of Robert, Comte d'Artois.--From a\r\nPen-and-ink Sketch in an Original Manuscript (Arch. of the Empire)]\r\n\r\nIn the course of this simple and graphic description mention has been made\r\nof the _lit de justice_ (seat of justice). All judicial or legislative\r\nassemblies at which the King considered it his duty to be present were\r\nthus designated; when the King came there simply as a looker-on, they were\r\nmore commonly called _plaidoyers_, and, in this case, no change was made\r\nin the ordinary arrangements; but when the King presided they were called\r\n_conseils_, and then a special ceremonial was required. In fact, by _lit\r\nde justice_ (Fig. 393), or _cour des pairs_, we understand a court\r\nconsisting of the high officers of the crown, and of the great executive\r\nof the State, whose duty it was to determine whether any peer of France\r\nshould be tried on a criminal charge; gravely to deliberate on any\r\npolitical matter of special interest; or to register, in the name of the\r\nabsolute sovereignty of the King, any edict of importance. We know the\r\nprominent, and, we may say, even the fatal, part played by these\r\nsolemnities, which were being continually re-enacted, and on every sort of\r\npretext, during the latter days of monarchy. These courts were always held\r\nwith impressive pomp. The sovereign usually summoned to them the princes\r\nof the blood royal and the officers of his household; the members of the\r\nParliament took their seats in scarlet robes, the presidents being habited\r\nin their caps and their mantles, and the registrars of the court also\r\nwearing their official dress. The High Chancellor, the First Chamberlain,\r\nand the Provost of Paris, sat at the King's feet. The Chancellor of\r\nFrance, the presidents and councillors of the Parliament, occupied the\r\nbar, and the ushers of the court were in a kneeling posture.\r\n\r\nHaving thus mentioned the assemblies of persons of distinction, the\r\ninterviews of sovereigns (Fig. 394), and the reception of\r\nambassadors--without describing them in detail, which would involve more\r\nspace than we have at our command--we will enter upon the subject of the\r\nspecial ceremonial adopted by the nobility, taking as our guide the\r\nstandard book called \"Honneurs de la Cour,\" compiled at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century by the celebrated Aliénor de Poitiers. In addition to\r\nher own observations, she gives those of her mother, Isabelle de Souza,\r\nwho herself had but continued the work of another noble lady, Jeanne\r\nd'Harcourt--married in 1391 to the Count William de Namur--who was\r\nconsidered the best authority to be found in the kingdom of France. This\r\ncollection of the customs of the court forms a kind of family diary\r\nembracing three generations, and extending back over more than a century.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the curious and interesting character of this book, and\r\nthe authority which it possesses on this subject, we cannot, much to our\r\nregret, do more than borrow a few passages from it; but these, carefully\r\nselected, will no doubt suffice to give some idea of the manners and\r\ncustoms of the nobility during the fifteenth century, and to illustrate\r\nthe laws of etiquette of which it was the recognised code.\r\n\r\nOne of the early chapters of the work sets forth this fundamental law of\r\nFrench ceremonial, namely, that, \"according to the traditions or customs\r\nof France, women, however exalted their position, be they even king's\r\ndaughters, rank with their husbands.\" We find on the occasion of the\r\nmarriage of King Charles VII. with Mary of Anjou, in 1413, although\r\nprobably there had never been assembled together so many princes and\r\nladies of rank, that at the banquet the ladies alone dined with the Queen,\r\n\"and no gentlemen sat with them.\" We may remark, whilst on this subject,\r\nthat before the reign of Francis I. it was not customary for the two sexes\r\nto be associated together in the ordinary intercourse of court life; and\r\nwe have elsewhere remarked (see chapter on Private Life) that this\r\ndeparture from ancient custom exerted a considerable influence, not only\r\non manners, but also on public affairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394.--Interview of King Charles V. with the Emperor\r\nCharles IV. in Paris in 1378.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the\r\nDescription of this Interview, Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century, in the\r\nLibrary of the Arsenal of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe authoress of the \"Honneurs de la Cour\" specially mentions the respect\r\nwhich Queen Mary of Anjou paid to the Duchess of Burgundy when she was at\r\nChâlons in Champagne in 1445: \"The Duchess came with all her retinue, on\r\nhorseback and in carriages, into the courtyard of the mansion where the\r\nKing and Queen were, and there alighted, her first maid of honour acting\r\nas her train-bearer. M. de Bourbon gave her his right hand, and the\r\ngentlemen went on in front. In this manner she was conducted to the hall\r\nwhich served as the ante-chamber to the Queen's apartment. There she\r\nstopped, and sent in M. de Crequi to ask the Queen if it was her pleasure\r\nthat she should enter.... When the Duchess came to the door she took the\r\ntrain of her dress from the lady who bore it and let it trail on the\r\nground, and as she entered she knelt and then adyanced to the middle of\r\nthe room. There she made the same obeisance, and moved straight towards\r\nthe Queen, who was standing close to the foot of her throne. When the\r\nDuchess had performed a further act of homage, the Queen advanced two or\r\nthree steps, and the Duchess fell on her knees; the Queen then put her\r\nhand on her shoulder, embraced her, kissed her, and commanded her to\r\nrise.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess then went up to Margaret of Scotland, wife of the Dauphin,\r\nafterwards Louis XI., \"who was four or five feet from the Queen,\" and paid\r\nher the same honours as she had done to the Queen, although the Dauphine\r\nappeared to wish to prevent her from absolutely kneeling to her. After\r\nthis she turned towards the Queen of Sicily (Isabelle de Lorraine, wife of\r\nRené of Anjou, brother-in-law of the King), \"who was two or three feet\r\nfrom the Dauphine,\" and merely bowed to her, and the same to another\r\nPrincess, Madame de Calabre, who was still more distantly connected with\r\nthe blood royal. Then the Queen, and after her the Dauphine, kissed the\r\nthree maids of honour of the Duchess and the wives of the gentlemen. The\r\nDuchess did the same to the ladies who accompanied the Queen and the\r\nDauphine, \"but of those of the Queen of Sicily the Duchess kissed none,\r\ninasmuch as the Queen had not kissed hers. And the Duchess would not walk\r\nbehind the Queen, for she said that the Duke of Burgundy was nearer the\r\ncrown of France than was the King of Sicily, and also that she was\r\ndaughter of the King of Portugal, who was greater than the King of\r\nSicily.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on, from the details given of a similar reception, we learn that\r\netiquette was not at that time regulated by the laws of politeness as now\r\nunderstood, inasmuch as the voluntary respect paid by men to the gentle\r\nsex was influenced much by social rank. Thus, at the time of a visit of\r\nLouis XI., then Dauphin, to the court of Brussels, to which place he went\r\nto seek refuge against the anger of his father, the Duchesses of Burgundy,\r\nof Charolais, and of Clèves, his near relatives, exhibited towards him all\r\nthe tokens of submission and inferiority which he might have received from\r\na vassal. The Dauphin, it is true, wished to avoid this homage, and a\r\ndisussion on the subject of \"more than a quarter of an hour ensued;\" at\r\nlast he took the Duchess of Burgundy by the arm and led her away, in order\r\nto cut short the ceremonies \"about which Madame made so much to do.\" This,\r\nhowever, did not prevent the princesses, on their withdrawing, from\r\nkneeling to the ground in order to show their respect for the son of the\r\nKing of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395.--The Entry of Louis XI. into Paris.--Fac-simile\r\nof a Miniature in the \"Chroniques\" of Monstrelet, Manuscript of the\r\nFifteenth Century (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the Duchess of Burgundy, when about to appear\r\nbefore the Queen, took her train from her train-bearer in order that she\r\nmight carry it herself. In this she was only conforming to a general\r\nprinciple, which was, that in the presence of a superior, a person,\r\nhowever high his rank, should not himself receive honours whilst at the\r\nsame time paying them to another. Thus a duke and a duchess amidst their\r\ncourt had all the things which were used at their table covered--hence the\r\nmodern expression, _mettre le couvert_ (to lay the cloth)--even the\r\nwash-hand basin and the _cadenas_, a kind of case in which the cups,\r\nknives, and other table articles were kept; but when they were\r\nentertaining a king all these marks of superiority were removed, as a\r\nmatter of etiquette, from the table at which they sat, and were passed on\r\nas an act of respect to the sovereign present.\r\n\r\nThe book of Dame Aliénor, in a series of articles to which we shall merely\r\nallude, speaks at great length and enters into detail respecting the\r\ninterior arrangements of the rooms in which princes and other noble\r\nchildren were born. The formalities gone through on these occasions were\r\nas curious as they were complicated; and Dame Aliénor regretted to see\r\nthem falling into disuse, \"owing to which,\" she says, \"we fear that the\r\npossessions of the great houses of the nobility are getting too large, as\r\nevery one admits, and chicanery or concealment of birth, so as to make\r\naway with too many children, is on the increase.\"\r\n\r\nMourning is the next subject which we shall notice. The King never wore\r\nblack for mourning, not even for his father, but scarlet or violet. The\r\nQueen wore white, and did not leave her apartments for a whole year. Hence\r\nthe name of _château, hôtel,_ or _tour de la Reine Blanche_, which many of\r\nthe buildings of the Middle Ages still bear, from the fact that widowed\r\nqueens inhabited them during the first year of their widowhood. On\r\noccasions of mourning, the various reception rooms of a house were hung\r\nwith black. In deep mourning, such as that for a husband or a father, a\r\nlady wore neither gloves, jewels, nor silk. The head was covered with a\r\nlow black head-dress, with trailing lappets, called _chaperons,\r\nbarbettes, couvre-chefs_, and _tourets_. A duchess and the wife of a\r\nknight or a banneret, on going into mourning, stayed in their apartments\r\nfor six weeks; the former, during the whole of this time, when in deep\r\nmourning, remained lying down all day on a bed covered with a white sheet;\r\nwhereas the latter, at the end of nine days, got up, and until the six\r\nweeks were over, remained sitting in front of the bed on a black sheet.\r\nLadies did not attend the funerals of their husbands, though it was usual\r\nfor them to be present at those of their fathers and mothers. For an elder\r\nbrother, they wore the same mourning as for a father, but they did not lie\r\ndown as above described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.--\"How the King-at-Arms presents the Sword to the\r\nDuke of Bourbon.\"--From a Miniature in \"Tournois du Roi René,\" Manuscript\r\nof the Fifteenth Century (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nIn their everyday intercourse with one another, kings, princes, dukes, and\r\nduchesses called one another _monsieur_ and _madame_, adding the Christian\r\nname or that of the estate. A superior speaking or writing to an inferior,\r\nmight prefix to his or her title of relationship _beau_ or _belle_; for\r\ninstance, _mon bel oncle, ma belle cousine_. People in a lower sphere of\r\nlife, on being introduced to one another, did not say, \"Monsieur Jean, ma\r\nbelle tante\"--\"Mr. John, allow me to introduce you to my aunt\"--but\r\nsimply, \"Jean, ma tante.\" The head of a house had his seat under a canopy\r\nor _dosseret_ (Fig. 396), which he only relinquished to his sovereign,\r\nwhen he had the honour of entertaining him. \"Such,\" says Aliénor, in\r\nconclusion, \"are the points of etiquette which are observed in Germany, in\r\nFrance, in Naples, in Italy, and in all other civilised countries and\r\nkingdoms.\" We may here remark, that etiquette, after having originated in\r\nFrance, spread throughout all Christian nations, and when it had become\r\nnaturalised, as it were, amongst the latter, it acquired a settled\r\nposition, which it retained more firmly than it did in France. In this\r\nlatter country, it was only from the seventeenth century, and particularly\r\nunder Louis XIV., that court etiquette really became a science, and almost\r\na species of religions observance, whose minutiae were attended to as much\r\nas if they were sacramental rites, though they were not unfrequently of\r\nthe most childish character, and whose pomp and precision often caused the\r\nmost insufferable annoyance. But notwithstanding the perpetual changes of\r\ntimes and customs, the French nation has always been distinguished for\r\nnobility and dignity, tempered with good sense and elegance.\r\n\r\nIf we now direct our attention to the _tiers état_, that class which, to\r\nquote a celebrated expression, \"was destined to become everything, after\r\nhaving for a long time been looked upon as nothing,\" we shall notice that\r\nthere, too, custom and tradition had much to do with ceremonies of all\r\nkinds. The presence of the middle classes not only gave, as it were, a\r\nstamp of grandeur to fêtes of an aristocratic and religions character,\r\nbut, in addition, the people themselves had a number of ceremonies of\r\nevery description, in which etiquette was not one whit less strict than\r\nin those of the court. The variety of civic and popular ceremonies is so\r\ngreat, that it would require a large volume, illustrated with numerous\r\nengravings, to explain fully their characteristic features. The simple\r\nenumeration of the various public fêtes, each of which was necessarily\r\naccompanied by a distinct ceremonial, would take up much time were we to\r\nattempt to give it even in the shortest manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397.--Entry of the Roi de l'Epinette at Lille, in the\r\nSixteenth Century.--From a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Library of\r\nRouen.]\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous ceremonies which were purely religious, namely, the\r\nprocession of the _Fête-Dieu_, in Rogation week, and the fêtes which were\r\nboth of a superstitions and burlesque character, such as _des Fous, de\r\nl'Ane, des Innocents_, and others of the same kind, so much in vogue\r\nduring the Middle Ages, and which we shall describe more in detail\r\nhereafter, we should like to mention the military or gymnastic fêtes.\r\nAmongst these were what were called the processions of the _Confrères de\r\nl'Arquebuse_, the _Archers_, the _Papegaut_, the _roi de l'Epinette_, at\r\nLille (Fig. 397), and the _Forestier_ at Bruges. There were also what may\r\nbe termed the fêtes peculiar to certain places, such as those of _Béhors_,\r\nof the _Champs Galat_ at Epinal, of the _Laboureurs_ at Montélimar, of\r\n_Guy l'an neuf_ at Anjou. Also of the fêtes of _May_, of the _sheaf_, of\r\nthe _spring_, of the _roses_, of the _fires of St. John_, &c. Then there\r\nwere the historical or commemorative fêtes, such as those of the _Géant\r\nReuss_ at Dunkerque, of the _Gayant_ at Douai, &c.; also of _Guet de\r\nSaint-Maxime_ at Riez in Provence, the processions of _Jeanne d'Arc_ at\r\nOrleans, of _Jeanne Hachette_ at Beauvais; and lastly, the numerous fêtes\r\nof public corporations, such as the _Écoliers_, the _Nations_, the\r\n_Universités_; also the _Lendit_, the _Saint-Charlemagne_, the _Baillée\r\ndes roses au Parlement_; the literary fêtes of the _Pays et Chambres de\r\nrhetorique_ of Picardy and Flanders, of the _Clémence Isaure_ at Toulouse,\r\nand of the _Capitole_ at Rome, &c.; the fêtes of the _Serments, Métiers_,\r\nand _Devoirs_ of the working men's corporation; and lastly, the _Fêtes\r\nPatronales_, called also _Assemblées, Ducasses, Folies, Foires, Kermesses,\r\nPardons_, &c.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple enumeration, it can easily be understood what a useless\r\ntask we should impose upon ourselves were we merely to enter upon so wide\r\nand difficult a subject. Apart from the infinite variety of details\r\nresulting from the local circumstances under which these ceremonies had\r\nbeen instituted, which were everywhere celebrated at fixed periods, a kind\r\nof general principle regulated and directed their arrangement. Nearly all\r\nthese fêtes and public rejoicings, which to a certain extent constituted\r\nthe common basis of popular ceremonial, bore much analogy to one another.\r\nThere are, however, certain peculiarities less known and more striking\r\nthan the rest, which deserve to be mentioned, and we shall then conclude\r\nthis part of our subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398.--Representation of a Ballet before Henri III.\r\nand his Court, in the Gallery of the Louvre.--Fac-simile of an Engraving\r\non Copper of the \"Ballet de la Royne,\" by Balthazar de Beaujoyeulx (folio,\r\nParis, Mamert Patisson, 1582.)]\r\n\r\nThose rites, ceremonies, and customs, which are the most commonly\r\nobserved, and which most persistently keep their place amongst us, are far\r\nfrom being of modern origin. Thus, the custom of jovially celebrating the\r\ncommencement of the new year, or of devoting certain particular days to\r\nfestivity, is still universally followed in every country in the world.\r\nThe practice of sending presents on _New Year's Day_ is to be found among\r\ncivilised nations in the East as well as in our own country. In the Middle\r\nAges the intimate friends of princes, and especially of the kings of\r\nFrance, received Christmas gifts, for which they considered themselves\r\nbound to make an ample return. In England these interchanges of generosity\r\nalso take place on Christmas Day. In Russia, on Easter Day, the people, on\r\nmeeting in the street, salute one another by saying \"Christ is risen.\"\r\nThese practices, as well as many others, have no doubt been handed down to\r\nus from the early ages of Christianity. The same may be said of a vast\r\nnumber of customs of a more or less local character, which have been\r\nobserved in various countries for centuries. In former times, at\r\nOchsenbach, in Wurtemberg, during the carnival, women held a feast at\r\nwhich they were waited upon by men, and, after it was over, they formed\r\nthemselves into a sort of court of plenary indulgence, from which the men\r\nwere uniformly excluded, and sat in judgment on one another. At Ramerupt,\r\na small town in Champagne, every year, on the 1st of May, twenty of the\r\ncitizens repaired to the adjoining hamlet of St. Remy, hunting as they\r\nwent along. They were called _the fools of Rameru_, and it was said that\r\nthe greatest fool led the band. The inhabitants of St. Remy were bound to\r\nreceive them gratuitously, and to supply them, as well as their horses and\r\ndogs, with what they required, to have a mass said for them, to put up\r\nwith all the absurd vagaries of the captain and his troop, and to supply\r\nthem with a _fine and handsome horned ram,_ which was led back in triumph.\r\nOn their return into Ramerupt they set up shouts at the door of the curé,\r\nthe procurator fiscal, and the collector of taxes, and, after the\r\ninvention of gunpowder, fireworks were let off. They then went to the\r\nmarket-place, where they danced round the ram, which was decorated with\r\nribbons. No doubt this was a relic of the feasts of ancient heathenism.\r\n\r\nA more curious ceremony still, whose origin, we think, may be traced to\r\nthe Dionysian feasts of heathenism, has continued to be observed to this\r\nday at Béziers. It bears the names of the _Feast of Pepézuch_, the\r\n_Triumph of Béziers,_ or the _Feast of Caritats_ or _Charités_. At the\r\nbottom of the Rue Française at Béziers, a statue is to be seen which,\r\nnotwithstanding the mutilations to which it has been subjected, still\r\ndistinctly bears traces of being an ancient work of the most refined\r\nperiod of art. This statue represents Pepézuch, a citizen of Béziers, who,\r\naccording to somewhat questionable tradition, valiantly defended the town\r\nagainst the Goths, or, as some say, against the English; its origin,\r\ntherefore, cannot be later than the thirteenth century. On Ascension Day,\r\nthe day of the Feast of Pepézuch, an immense procession went about the\r\ntown. Three remarkable machines were particularly noticeable; the first\r\nwas an enormous wooden camel made to walk by mechanism, and to move its\r\nlimbs and jaws; the second was a galley on wheels fully manned; the third\r\nconsisted of a cart on which a travelling theatre was erected. The consuls\r\nand other civic authorities, the corporations of trades having the pastors\r\nwalking in front of them, the farriers on horseback, all bearing their\r\nrespective insignia and banners, formed the procession. A double column,\r\ncomposed of a division of young men and young women holding white hoops\r\ndecorated with ribbons and many-coloured streamers, was preceded by a\r\nyoung girl crowned with flowers, half veiled, and carrying a basket. This\r\nbrilliant procession marched to the sound of music, and, at certain\r\ndistances, the youthful couples of the two sexes halted, in order to\r\nperform, with the assistance of their hoops, various figures, which were\r\ncalled the _Danse des Treilles_. The machines also stopped from time to\r\ntime at various places. The camel was especially made to enter the Church\r\nof St. Aphrodise, because it was said that the apostle had first come on a\r\ncamel to preach the Gospel in that country, and there to receive the palm\r\nof martyrdom. On arriving before the statue of Pepézuch the young people\r\ndecorated it with garlands. When the square of the town was reached, the\r\ntheatre was stopped like the ancient car of Thespis, and the actors\r\ntreated the people to a few comical drolleries in imitation of\r\nAristophanes. From the galley the youths flung sugar-plums and sweetmeats,\r\nwhich the spectators returned in equal profusion. The procession closed\r\nwith a number of men, crowned with green leaves, carrying on their heads\r\nloaves of bread, which, with other provisions contained in the galley,\r\nwere distributed amongst the poor of the town.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and in France it was the custom at the public entries of kings,\r\nprinces, and persons of rank, to offer them the wines made in the district\r\nand commonly sold in the town. At Langres, for instance, these wines were\r\nput into four pewter vessels called _cimaises_, which are still to be\r\nseen. They were called the _lion, monkey, sheep_, and _pig_ wines,\r\nsymbolical names, which expressed the different degrees or phases of\r\ndrunkenness which they were supposed to be capable of producing: the lion,\r\ncourage; the monkey, cunning; the sheep, good temper; the pig, bestiality.\r\n\r\nWe will now conclude by borrowing, from the excellent work of M. Alfred\r\nMichiels on Dutch and Flemish painting, the abridged description of a\r\nprocession of corporations of trades, which took place at Antwerp in 1520,\r\non the Sunday after Ascension Day. \"All the corporations of trades were\r\npresent, every member being dressed in his best suit.\" In front of each\r\nguild a banner floated; and immediately behind an enormous lighted\r\nwax-taper was carried. March music was played on long silver trumpets,\r\nflutes, and drums. The goldsmiths, painters, masons, silk embroiderers,\r\nsculptors, carpenters, boatmen, fishermen, butchers, curriers, drapers,\r\nbakers, tailors, and men of every other trade marched two abreast. Then\r\ncame crossbowmen, arquebusiers, archers, &c., some on foot and some on\r\nhorseback. After them came the various monastic orders; and then followed\r\na crowd of bourgeois magnificently dressed. A numerous company of widows,\r\ndressed in white from head to foot, particularly attracted attention; they\r\nconstituted a sort of sisterhood, observing certain rules, and gaining\r\ntheir livelihood by various descriptions of manual work. The cathedral\r\ncanons and the other priests walked in the procession in their gorgeous\r\nsilk vestments sparkling with gold. Twenty persons carried on their\r\nshoulders a huge figure of the Virgin, with the infant Saviour in her\r\narms, splendidly decorated. At the end of the procession were chariots and\r\nships on wheels. There were various groups in the procession representing\r\nscenes from the Old and New Testament, such as the _Salutation of the\r\nAngels_, the _Visitation of the Magi_, who appeared riding on camels, the\r\n_Flight into Egypt_, and other well-known historical incidents. The last\r\nmachine represented a dragon being led by St. Margaret with a magnificent\r\nbridle, and was followed by St. George and several brilliantly attired\r\nknights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399.--Sandal and Buskin of Charlemagne.--From the\r\nAbbey of St. Denis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCostumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of Ancient Costume.--Costume in the Fifth\r\n  Century.--Hair.--Costumes in the Time of Charlemagne.--Origin of Modern\r\n  National Dress.--Head-dresses and Beards: Time of St. Louis.--Progress\r\n  of Dress: Trousers, Hose, Shoes, Coats, Surcoats, Capes.--Changes in the\r\n  Fashions of Shoes and Hoods.--_Livrée_,--Cloaks and Capes.--Edicts\r\n  against Extravagant Fashions.--Female Dress: Gowns, Bonnets,\r\n  Head-dresses, &c.--Disappearance of Ancient Dress.--Tight-fitting\r\n  Gowns.--General Character of Dress under Francis I.--Uniformity of\r\n  Dress.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong garments alone were worn by the ancients, and up to the period when\r\nthe barbarous tribes of the North made their appearance, or rather, until\r\nthe invasion of the Roman Empire by these wandering nations, male and\r\nfemale dress differed but little. The Greeks made scarcely any change in\r\ntheir mode of dress for centuries; but the Romans, on becoming masters of\r\nthe world, partially adopted the dress and arms of the people they had\r\nconquered, where they considered them an improvement on their own,\r\nalthough the original style of dress was but little altered (Figs. 400 and\r\n401).\r\n\r\nRoman attire consisted of two garments--the under garment, or _tunic_, and\r\nthe outer garment, or _cloak_; the latter was known under the various\r\nnames of _chlamys, toga_, and _pallium_, but, notwithstanding these\r\nseveral appellations, there was scarcely any appreciable distinction\r\nbetween them. The simple tunic with sleeves, which answered to our shirt,\r\nwas like the modern blouse in shape, and was called by various names. The\r\n_chiridota_ was a tunic with long and large sleeves, of Asiatic origin;\r\nthe _manuleata_ was a tunic with long and tight sleeves coming to the\r\nwrists; the _talaris_ was a tunic reaching to the feet; the _palmata_ was\r\na state tunic, embroidered with palms, which ornamentation was often found\r\nin other parts of dress. The _lacerna_, _loena_, _cucullus_, _chlamys_,\r\n_sagum_, _paludamentum_, were upper garments, more or less coarse, either\r\nfull or scant, and usually short, and were analogous to our cloaks,\r\nmantles, &c., and were made both with and without hoods. There were many\r\nvarieties of the tunic and cloak invented by female ingenuity, as well as\r\nof other articles of dress, which formed elegant accessories to the\r\ntoilet, but there was no essential alteration in the national costume, nor\r\nwas there any change in the shape of the numerous descriptions of shoes.\r\nThe barbarian invasions brought about a revolution in the dress as well as\r\nin the social state of the people, and it is from the time of these\r\ninvasions that we may date, properly speaking, the history of modern\r\ndress; for the Roman costume, which was in use at the same time as that of\r\nthe Franks, the Huns, the Vandals, the Goths, &c., was subjected to\r\nvarious changes down to the ninth century. These modifications increased\r\nafterwards to such an extent that, towards the fourteenth century, the\r\noriginal type had altogether disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 400 and 401.--Gallo-Roman Costumes.--From Bas-reliefs\r\ndiscovered in Paris in 1711 underneath the Choir of Notre-Dame.]\r\n\r\nIt was quite natural that men living in a temperate climate, and bearing\r\narms only when in the service of the State, should be satisfied with\r\ngarments which they could wear without wrapping themselves up too closely.\r\nThe northern nations, on the contrary, had early learned to protect\r\nthemselves against the severity of the climate in which they lived. Thus\r\nthe garments known by them as _braies_, and by the Parthians as\r\n_sarabara_, doubtless gave origin to those which have been respectively\r\ncalled by us _chausses, haut-de-chausses, trousses, grègues, culottes,\r\npantalons_, &c. These wandering people had other reasons for preferring\r\nthe short and close-fitting garments to those which were long and full,\r\nand these were their innate pugnacity, which forced them ever to be under\r\narms, their habit of dwelling in forests and thickets, their love of the\r\nchase, and their custom of wearing armour.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans always went bareheaded in the towns; but in\r\nthe country, in order to protect themselves from the direct rays of the\r\nsun, they wore hats much resembling our round hats, made of felt, plaited\r\nrushes, or straw. Other European nations of the same period also went\r\nbareheaded, or wore caps made of skins of animals, having no regularity of\r\nstyle, and with the shape of which we are but little acquainted.\r\n\r\nShoes, and head-dresses of a definite style, belong to a much more modern\r\nperiod, as also do the many varieties of female dress, which have been\r\nknown at all times and in all countries under the general name of _robes_.\r\nThe girdle was only used occasionally, and its adoption depended on\r\ncircumstances; the women used it in the same way as the men, for in those\r\ndays it was never attached to the dress. The great difference in modern\r\nfemale costume consists in the fact of the girdle being part of the dress,\r\nthus giving a long or short waist, according to the requirements of\r\nfashion. In the same manner, a complete revolution took place in men's\r\ndress according as loose or tight, long or short sleeves were introduced.\r\n\r\nWe shall commence our historical sketch from the fifth century, at which\r\nperiod we can trace the blending of the Roman with the barbaric\r\ncostume--namely, the combination of the long, shapeless garment with that\r\nwhich was worn by the Germans, and which was accompanied by tight-fitting\r\nbraies. Thus, in the recumbent statue which adorned the tomb of Clovis, in\r\nthe Church of the Abbey of St. Geneviève, the King is represented as\r\nwearing the _tunic_ and the _toga_, but, in addition, Gallo-Roman\r\ncivilization had actually given him tight-fitting braies, somewhat similar\r\nto what we now call pantaloons. Besides this, his tunic is fastened by a\r\nbelt; which, however, was not a novelty in his time, for the women then\r\nwore long dresses, fastened at the waist by a girdle. There is nothing\r\nvery remarkable about his shoes, since we find that the shoe, or closed\r\nsandal, was worn from the remotest periods by nearly all nations (Figs.\r\n402 and 403).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402.--Costume of King Clovis (Sixth Century).--From a\r\nStatue on his Tomb, formerly in the Abbey of St. Geneviève.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403.--Costume of King Childebert (Seventh\r\nCentury).--From a Statue formerly placed in the Refectory of the Abbey of\r\nSt. Germain-des-Prés.]\r\n\r\nThe cloak claims an equally ancient origin. The principal thing worthy of\r\nnotice is the amount of ornament with which the Franks enriched their\r\ngirdles and the borders of their tunics and cloaks. This fashion they\r\nborrowed from the Imperial court, which, having been transferred from Rome\r\nto Constantinople during the third century, was not slow to adopt the\r\nluxury of precious stones and other rich decorations commonly in use\r\namongst Eastern nations. Following the example of Horace de Vielcastel,\r\nthe learned author of a history of the costumes of France, we may here\r\nstate that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to define the exact\r\ncostume during the time of the early Merovingian periods. The first\r\nwriters who have touched upon this subject have spoken of it very vaguely,\r\nor not being contemporaries of the times of which they wrote, could only\r\ndescribe from tradition or hearsay. Those monuments in which early costume\r\nis supposed to be represented are almost all of later date, when artists,\r\nwhether sculptors or painters, were not very exact in their delineations\r\nof costume, and even seemed to imagine that no other style could have\r\nexisted before their time than the one with which they were daily\r\nfamiliar. In order to be as accurate as possible, although, after all, we\r\ncan only speak hypothetically, we cannot do better than call to mind, on\r\nthe one hand, what Tacitus says of the Germans, that they \"were almost\r\nnaked, excepting for a short and tight garment round their waists, and a\r\nlittle square cloak which they threw over the right shoulder,\" and, on the\r\nother, to carry ourselves back in imagination to the ancient Roman\r\ncostume. We may notice, moreover, the curious description given of the\r\nFranks by Sidoine Apollinaire, who says, \"They tied up their flaxen or\r\nlight-brown hair above their foreheads, into a kind of tuft, and then made\r\nit fall behind the head like a horse's tail. The face was clean shaved,\r\nwith the exception of two long moustaches. They wore cloth garments,\r\nfitting tight to the body and limbs, and a broad belt, to which they hung\r\ntheir swords.\" But this is a sketch made at a time when the Frankish race\r\nwas only known among the Gauls through its marauding tribes, whose raids,\r\nfrom time to time, spread terror and dismay throughout the countries which\r\nthey visited. From the moment when the uncultivated tribes of ancient\r\nGermany formally took possession of the territory which they had withdrawn\r\nfrom Roman rule, they showed themselves desirous of adopting the more\r\ngentle manners of the conquered nation. \"In imitation of their chief,\"\r\nsays M. Jules Quicherat, the eminent antiquarian, \"more than once the\r\nFranks doffed the war coat and the leather Belt, and assumed the toga of\r\nRoman dignity. More than once their flaxen hair was shown to advantage by\r\nflowing over the imperial mantle, and the gold of the knights, the purple\r\nof the senators and patricians, the triumphal crowns, the fasces, and, in\r\nshort, everything which the Roman Empire invented in order to exhibit its\r\ngrandeur, assisted in adding to that of our ancestors.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 404 and 405.--Saints in the Costume of the Sixth to\r\nthe Eighth Centuries.--From Miniatures in old Manuscripts of the Royal\r\nLibrary of Brussels (Designs by Count H. de Vielcastel).]\r\n\r\nOne great and characteristic difference between the Romans and the Franks\r\nshould, however, be specially mentioned; namely, in the fashion of wearing\r\nthe hair long, a fashion never adopted by the Romans, and which, during\r\nthe whole of the first dynasty, was a distinguishing mark of kings and\r\nnobles among the Franks. Agathias, the Greek historian, says, \"The hair is\r\nnever cut from the heads of the Frankish kings' sons. From early youth\r\ntheir hair falls gracefully over their shoulders, it is parted on the\r\nforehead, and falls equally on both sides; it is with them a matter to\r\nwhich they give special attention.\" We are told, besides, that they\r\nsprinkled it with gold-dust, and plaited it in small bands, which they\r\nornamented with pearls and precious metals.\r\n\r\nWhilst persons of rank were distinguished by their long and flowing hair,\r\nthe people wore theirs more or less short, according to the degree of\r\nfreedom which they possessed, and the serfs had their heads completely\r\nshaved. It was customary for the noble and free classes to swear by their\r\nhair, and it was considered the height of politeness to pull out a hair\r\nand present it to a person. Frédégaire, the chronicler, relates that\r\nClovis thus pulled out a hair in order to do honour to St. Germer, Bishop\r\nof Toulouse, and presented it to him; upon this, the courtiers hastened to\r\nimitate their sovereign, and the venerable prelate returned home with his\r\nhand full of hair, delighted at the flattering reception he had met with\r\nat the court of the Frankish king. Durinig the Merovingian period, the\r\ngreatest insult that could be offered to a freeman was to touch him with a\r\nrazor or scissors. The degradation of kings and princes was carried out in\r\na public manner by shaving their heads and sending them into a monastery;\r\non their regaining their rights and their authority, their hair was always\r\nallowed to grow again. We may also conclude that great importance was\r\nattached to the preservation of the hair even under the kings of the\r\nsecond dynasty, for Charlemagne, in his Capitulaires, orders the hair to\r\nbe removed as a punishment in certain crimes.\r\n\r\nThe Franks, faithful to their ancient custom of wearing the hair long,\r\ngradually gave up shaving the face. At first, they only left a small tuft\r\non the chin, but by degrees they allowed this to increase, and in the\r\nsixth and seventh centuries freemen adopted the usual form of beard.\r\nAmongst the clergy, the custom prevailed of shaving the crown of the head,\r\nin the same way as that adopted by certain monastic orders in the present\r\nday. Priests for a long time wore beards, but ceased to do so on their\r\nbecoming fashionable amongst the laity (Figs. 406, 407). Painters and\r\nsculptors therefore commit a serious error in representing the prelates\r\nand monks of those times with large beards.\r\n\r\nAs far as the monumental relics of those remote times allow us to judge,\r\nthe dress as worn by Clovis underwent but trifing modifications during the\r\nfirst dvnasty; but during the reigns of Pepin and Charlemagne considerable\r\nchanges were effected, which resulted from the intercourse, either of a\r\nfriendly or hostile nature, between the Franks and the southern nations.\r\nAbout this time, silk stuffs were introduced into the kingdom, and the\r\nupper classes, in order to distinguish themselves from the lower, had\r\ntheir garments trimmed round with costly furs (see chapter on Commerce).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 406 and 407.--Costume of the Prelates from the Eighth\r\nto the Tenth Centuries--After Miniatures in the \"Missal of St. Gregory,\"\r\nin the National Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\nWe have before stated (see chapter on Private Life) that Charlemagne, who\r\nalways was very simple in his tastes, strenuously set his face against\r\nthese novel introductions of luxury, which he looked upon as tending to do\r\nharm. \"Of what use are these cloaks?\" he said; \"in bed they cannot cover\r\nus, on horseback they can neither protect us from the rain nor the wind,\r\nand when we are sitting they can neither preserve our legs from the cold\r\nnor the damp.\" He himself generally wore a large tunic made of otters'\r\nskins. On one occasion his courtiers went out hunting with him, clothed in\r\nsplendid garments of southern fashion, which became much torn by the\r\nbriars, and begrimed with the blood of the animals they had killed. \"Oh,\r\nye foolish men!\" he said to them the next day as he showed them his own\r\ntunic, which a servant had just returned to him in perfect condition,\r\nafter having simply dried it before the fire and rubbed it with his hands.\r\n\"Whose garments are the more valuable and the more useful? mine, for which\r\nI have only paid a sou (about twenty-two francs of present money), or\r\nyours, which have cost so much?\" From that time, whenever this great king\r\nentered on a campaign, the officers of his household, even the most rich\r\nand powerful, did not dare to show themselves in any clothes but those\r\nmade of leather, wool, or cloth; for had they, on such occasions, made\r\ntheir appearance dressed in silk and ornaments, he would have sharply\r\nreproved them and have treated them as cowards, or as effeminate, and\r\nconsequently unfit for the work in which he was about to engage.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this monarch, who so severely proscribed luxury in daily\r\nlife, made the most magnificent display on the occasions of political or\r\nreligious festivals, when the imperial dignity with which he was invested\r\nrequired to be set forth by pompous ceremonial and richness of attire.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the other Carlovingian kings, in the midst of\r\npolitical troubles, of internal wars, and of social disturbances, they had\r\nneither time nor inclination for inventing new fashions. Monuments of the\r\nlatter part of the ninth century prove, indeed, that the national dress\r\nhad hardly undergone any change since the time of Charlemagne, and that\r\nthe influence of Roman tradition, especially on festive occasions, was\r\nstill felt in the dress of the nobles (Figs. 408 to 411).\r\n\r\nIn a miniature of the large MS. Bible given by the canons of Saint-Martin\r\nof Tours in 869 to Charles the Bald (National Library of Paris), we find\r\nthe King sitting on his throne surrounded by the dignitaries of his court,\r\nand by soldiers all dressed after the Roman fashion. The monarch wears a\r\ncloak which seems to be made of cloth of gold, and is attached to the\r\nshoulder by a strap or ribbon sliding through a clasp; this cloak is\r\nembroidered in red, on a gold ground; the tunic is of reddish brown, and\r\nthe shoes are light red, worked with gold thread. In the same manuscript\r\nthere is another painting, representing four women listening to the\r\ndiscourse of a prophet. From this we discover that the female costume of\r\nthe time consisted of two tunics, the under one being longer but less\r\ncapacious than the other, the sleeves of the former coming down tight to\r\nthe wrists, and being plaited in many folds, whilst those of the latter\r\nopen out, and only reach to the elbow. The lower part, the neck, and the\r\nborders of the sleeves are trimmed with ornamented bands, the waist is\r\nencircled by a girdle just above the hips, and a long veil, finely worked,\r\nand fastened on the head, covers the shoulders and hangs down to the feet,\r\ncompletely hiding the hair, so that long plaits falling in front were\r\nevidently not then in fashion. The under dress of these four women--who\r\nall wear black shoes, which were probably made of morocco leather--are of\r\nvarious colours, whereas the gowns or outer tunics are white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408.--Costume of a Scholar of the Carlovingian Period\r\n(St. Matthew writing his Gospel under the Inspiration of Christ).--From a\r\nMiniature in a Manuscript of the Ninth Century, in the Burgundian Library,\r\nBrussels (drawn by Count H. de Vielcastel).]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that under the Carlovingian dynasty it was always\r\nconsidered a shame and a dishonour to have the head shaved, it must not be\r\nsupposed that the upper classes continued to wear the long Merovingian\r\nstyle of hair. After the reign of Charlemagne, it was the fashion to shave\r\nthe hair from above the forehead, the parting being thus widened, and the\r\nhair was so arranged that it should not fall lower than the middle of the\r\nneck. Under Charles the Bald, whose surname proves that he was not partial\r\nto long hair, this custom fell into disuse or was abandoned, and men had\r\nthe greater part of their heads shaved, and only kept a sort of cap of\r\nhair growing on the top of the head. It is at this period that we first\r\nfind the _cowl_ worn. This kind of common head-dress, made from the furs\r\nof animals or from woollen stuffs, continued to be worn for many\r\ncenturies, and indeed almost to the present day. It was originally only a\r\nkind of cap, light and very small; but it gradually became extended in\r\nsize, and successively covered the ears, the neck, and lastly even the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nNo great change was made in the dress of the two sexes during the tenth\r\ncentury. \"Nothing was more simple than the head-dress of women,\" says M.\r\nJules Quicherat; \"nothing was less studied than their mode of wearing\r\ntheir hair; nothing was more simple, and yet finer, than their linen. The\r\nelegant appearance of their garments recalls that of the Greek and Roman,\r\nwomen. Their dresses were at times so tight as to display all the elegance\r\nof their form, whilst at others they were made so high as completely to\r\ncover the neck; the latter were called _cottes-hardies_. The\r\n_cotte-hardie_, which has at all times been part of the dress of French\r\nwomen, and which was frequently worn also by men, was a long tunic\r\nreaching to the heels, fastened in at the waist and closed at the wrists.\r\nQueens, princesses, and ladies of the nobility wore in addition a long\r\ncloak lined with ermine, or a tunic with or without sleeves; often, too,\r\ntheir dress consisted of two tunics, and of a veil or drapery, which was\r\nthrown over the head and fell down before and behind, thus entirely\r\nsurrounding the neck.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409.--Costume of a Scholar.\r\n\r\nFig. 410.--Costume of a Bishop or Abbot.\r\n\r\nFac-similes of Miniatures in a Manuscript of the Ninth Century (\"Biblia\r\nSacra\"), in the Royal Library of Brussels.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot find that any very decided change was made in dress before the\r\nend of the eleventh century. The ordinary dress made of thick cloths and\r\nof coarse woollen stuffs was very strong and durable, and not easily\r\nspoiled; and it was usual, as we still find in some provinces which adhere\r\nto old customs, for clothes, especially those worn on festive occasions\r\nand at ceremonials, to be handed down as heirlooms from father to son, to\r\nthe third or fourth generation. The Normans, who came from Scandinavia\r\ntowards the end of the tenth century, A.D. 970, with their short clothes\r\nand coats of mail, at first adopted the dress of the French, and continued\r\nto do so in all its various changes. In the following century, having\r\nfound the Saxons and Britons in England clad in the garb of their\r\nancestors, slightly modified by the Roman style of apparel, they began to\r\nmake great changes in their manner of dressing themselves. They more and\r\nmore discarded Roman fashions, and assumed similar costumes to those made\r\nin France at the same period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411.--Costume of Charles the Simple (Tenth\r\nCentury).--From a Miniature in the \"Rois de France,\" by Du Tillet,\r\nManuscript of the Sixteenth Century (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further in our history of mediæval dress, we must\r\nforestall a remark which will not fail to be made by the reader, and this\r\nis, that we seem to occupy ourselves exclusively with the dress of kings,\r\nqueens, and other people of note. But we must reply, that though we are\r\nable to form tolerably accurate notions relative to the dress of the upper\r\nclasses during these remote periods, we do not possess any reliable\r\ninformation relative to that of the lower orders, and that the written\r\ndocuments, as well as the sculptures and paintings, are almost useless on\r\nthis point. Nevertheless, we may suppose that the dress of the men in the\r\nlowest ranks of society has always been short and tight, consisting of\r\n_braies_, or tight drawers, mostly made of leather, of tight tunics, of\r\n_sayons_ or doublets, and of capes or cloaks of coarse brown woollen. The\r\ntunic was confined at the waist by a belt, to which the knife, the purse,\r\nand sometimes the working tools were suspended. The head-dress of the\r\npeople was generally a simple cap made of thick, coarse woollen cloth or\r\nfelt, and often of sheep's skin. During the twelfth century, a person's\r\nrank or social position was determined by the head-dress. The cap was made\r\nof velvet for persons of rank, and of common cloth for the poor. The\r\n_cornette_, which was always an appendage to the cap, was made of cloth,\r\nwith which the cap might be fastened or adjusted on the head. The\r\n_mortier_, or round cap, dates from the earliest centuries, and was\r\naltered both in shape and material according to the various changes of\r\nfashion; but lawyers of high position continued to wear it almost in its\r\noriginal shape, and it became like a professional badge for judges and\r\nadvocates.\r\n\r\nIn the miniatures of that time we find Charles the Good, Count of\r\nFlanders, who died in 1127, represented with a cap with a point at the\r\ntop, to which a long streamer is attached, and a peak turned up in front.\r\nA cap very similar, but without the streamer, and with the point turned\r\ntowards the left, is to be seen in a portrait of Geoffroy le Bel, Comte de\r\nMaine, in 1150. About the same period, Agnès de Baudement is represented\r\nwith a sort of cap made of linen or stuff, with lappets hanging down over\r\nthe shoulders; she is dressed in a robe fastened round the waist, and\r\nhaving long bands attached to the sleeves near the wrists. Queen\r\nIngeburge, second wife of Philip Augustus, also wore the tight gown,\r\nfastened at the collar by a round buckle, and two bands of stuff forming a\r\nkind of necklace; she also used the long cloak, and the closed shoes,\r\nwhich had then begun to be made pointed. Robert, Comte de Dreux, who lived\r\nat the same period, is also dressed almost precisely like the Queen,\r\nnotwithstanding the difference of sex and rank; his robe, however, only\r\ndescends to the instep, and his belt has no hangings in front. The Queen\r\nis represented with her hair long and flowing, but the count has his cut\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412.--Costume of King Louis le Jeune--Miniature of\r\nthe \"Rois de France,\" by Du Tillet (Sixteenth Century), in the National\r\nLibrary of Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413.--Royal Costume.--From a Miniature in a Manuscript\r\nof the Twelfth Century, in the Burgundian Library, Brussels.]\r\n\r\nWomen, in addition to their head-dress, often wore a broad band, which was\r\ntied under the chin, and gave the appearance of a kind of frame for the\r\nface. Both sexes wore coloured bands on their shoes, which were tied round\r\nthe ankles like those of sandals, and showed the shape of the foot.\r\n\r\nThe beard, which was worn in full at the beginning of the twelfth century,\r\nwas by degrees modified both as to shape and length. At first it was cut\r\nin a point, and only covered the end of the chin, but the next fashion was\r\nto wear it so as to join the moustaches. Generally, under Louis le Jeune\r\n(Fig. 412), moustaches went out of fashion. We next find beards worn only\r\nby country people, who, according to contemporary historians, desired to\r\npreserve a \"remembrance of their participation in the Crusades.\" At the\r\nend of this century, all chins were shaved.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades also gave rise to the general use of the purse, which was\r\nsuspended to the belt by a cord of silk or cotton, and sometimes by a\r\nmetal chain. At the time of the Holy War, it had become an emblem\r\ncharacteristic of pilgrims, who, before starting for Palestine, received\r\nfrom the hands of the priest the cross, the pilgrim's staff, and the\r\npurse.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the time of Louis IX. (Figs. 414 to 418), of that good king\r\nwho, according to the testimony of his historians, generally dressed with\r\nthe greatest simplicity, but who, notwithstanding his usual modesty and\r\neconomy, did not hesitate on great occasions to submit to the pomp\r\nrequired by the regal position which he held. \"Sometimes,\" says the Sire\r\nde Joinville, \"he went into his garden dressed in a camel's-hair coat, a\r\nsurcoat of linsey-woolsey without sleeves, a black silk cloak without a\r\nhood, and a hat trimmed with peacocks' feathers. At other times he was\r\ndressed in a coat of blue silk, a surcoat and mantle of scarlet satin, and\r\na cotton cap.\"\r\n\r\nThe surcoat (_sur-cotte_) was at first a garment worn only by females, but\r\nit was soon adopted by both sexes: it was originally a large wrapper with\r\nsleeves, and was thrown over the upper part of the robe (_cotte_), hence\r\nits name, _sur-cotte._ Very soon it was made without sleeves--doubtless,\r\nas M. Quicherat remarks, that the under garment, which was made of more\r\ncostly material, might be seen; and then, with the same object, and in\r\norder that the due motion of the limbs might not be interfered with, the\r\nsurcoat was raised higher above the hips, and the arm-holes were made very\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414.--Costume of a Princess dressed in a Cloak lined\r\nwith Fur.--From a Miniature of the Thirteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415.--Costume of William Malgeneste, the King's\r\nHuntsman, as represented on his Tomb, formerly in the Abbey of Long-Pont.]\r\n\r\nAt the consecration of Louis IX., in 1226, the nobles wore the cap\r\n(_mortier_) trimmed with fur; the bishops wore the cope and the mitre, and\r\ncarried the crosier. Louis IX., at the age of thirteen, is represented, in\r\na picture executed in 1262 (Sainte-Chapelle, Paris), with his hair short,\r\nand wearing a red velvet cap, a tunic, and over this a cloak open at the\r\nchest, having long sleeves, which are slit up for the arms to go through;\r\nthis cloak, or surcoat, is trimmed with ermine in front, and has the\r\nappearance of what we should now call a fur shawl. The young King has long\r\nhose, and shoes similar in shape to high slippers. In the same painting\r\nQueen Margaret, his wife, wears a gown with tight bodice opened out on the\r\nhips, and having long and narrow sleeves; she also has a cloak embroidered\r\nwith fleurs-de-lis, the long sleeves of which are slit up and bordered\r\nwith ermine; a kind of hood, much larger than her head, and over this a\r\nveil, which passes under the chin without touching the face; the shoes are\r\nlong, and seem to enclose the feet very tightly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416.--Costumes of the Thirteenth Century: Tristan and\r\nthe beautiful Yseult.--From a Miniature in the Romance of \"Tristan,\"\r\nManuscript of the Fourteenth Century (Imperial Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nFrom this period gowns with tight bodices were generally adopted; the\r\nwomen wore over them a tight jacket, reaching to a little below the hips,\r\noften trimmed with fur when the gown was richly ornamented, and itself\r\nrichly ornamented when the gown was plain. They also began to plait the\r\nhair, which fell down by the side of the face to the neck, and they\r\nprofusely decorated it with pearls or gold or silver ornaments. Jeanne,\r\nQueen of Navarre, wife of Philippe le Bel, is represented with a pointed\r\ncap, on the turned-up borders of which the hair clusters in thick curls on\r\neach side of the face; on the chest is a frill turned down in two points;\r\nthe gown, fastened in front by a row of buttons, has long and tight\r\nsleeves, with a small slit at the wrists closed by a button; lastly, the\r\nQueen wears, over all, a sort of second robe in the shape of a cloak, the\r\nsleeves of which are widely slit in the middle.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the thirteenth century luxury was at its height at the court\r\nof France: gold and silver, pearls and precious stones were lavished on\r\ndress. At the marriage of Philip III., son of St. Louis, the gentlemen\r\nwere dressed in scarlet; the ladies in cloth of gold, embroidered and\r\ntrimmed with gold and silver lace. Massive belts of gold were also worn,\r\nand chaplets sparkling with the same costly metal. Moreover, this\r\nmagnificence and display (see chapter on Private Life) was not confined to\r\nthe court, for we find that it extended to the bourgeois class, since\r\nPhilippe le Bel, by his edict of 1294, endeavoured to limit this\r\nextravagance, which in the eyes of the world had an especial tendency to\r\nobliterate, or at least to conceal, all distinctions of birth, rank, and\r\ncondition. Wealth strove hard at that time to be the sole standard of\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the fourteenth century--an epoch of the Middle Ages at\r\nwhich, after many changes of fashion, and many struggles against the\r\nancient Roman and German traditions, modern national costume seems at last\r\nto have assumed a settled and normal character--we think it right to\r\nrecapitulate somewhat, with a view to set forth the nature of the various\r\nelements which were at work from time to time in forming the fashions in\r\ndress. In order to give more weight to our remarks, we will extract,\r\nalmost word for word, a few pages from the learned and excellent work\r\nwhich M. Jules Quicherat has published on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Towards the year 1280,\" he says, \"the dress of a man--not of a man as the\r\nword was then used, which meant _serf_, but of one to whom the exercise of\r\nhuman prerogatives was permitted, that is to say, of an ecclesiastic, a\r\nbourgeois, or a noble--was composed of six indispensable portions: the\r\n_braies_, or breeches, the stockings, the shoes, the coat, the surcoat, or\r\n_cotte-hardie,_ and the _chaperon_, or head-dress. To these articles those\r\nwho wished to dress more elegantly added, on the body, a shirt; on the\r\nshoulders, a mantle; and on the head, a hat, or _fronteau_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417.--Costumes of the Common People in the Fourteenth\r\nCentury: Italian Gardener and Woodman.--From two Engravings in the Bonnart\r\nCollection.]\r\n\r\n\"The _braies_, or _brayes_, were a kind of drawers, generally knitted,\r\nsometimes made of woollen stuff or silk, and sometimes even of undressed\r\nleather. .... Our ancestors derived this part of their dress from the\r\nancient Gauls; only the Gallic braies came down to the ankle, whereas\r\nthose of the thirteenth century only reached to the calf. They were\r\nfastened above the hips by means of a belt called the _braier_.\r\n\r\n\"By _chausses_ was meant what we now call long stockings or hose. The\r\nstockings were of the same colour and material as the braies, and were\r\nkept up by the lower part of the braies being pulled over them, and tied\r\nwith a string.\r\n\r\n\"The shoes were made of various kinds of leather, the quality of which\r\ndepended on the way in which they were tanned, and were either of common\r\nleather, or of leather which was similar to that we know as morocco, and\r\nwas called _cordouan_ or _cordua_ (hence the derivation of the word\r\n_cordouannier_, which has now become _cordonnier_). Shoes were generally\r\nmade pointed; this fashion of the _poulaines_, or Polish points, was\r\nfollowed throughout the whole of Europe for nearly three hundred years,\r\nand, when first introduced, the Church was so scandalized by it that it\r\nwas almost placed in the catalogue of heresies. Subsequently, the taste\r\nrespecting the exaggerated length of the points was somewhat modified, but\r\nit had become so inveterate that the tendency for pointed shoes returning\r\nto their former absurd extremes was constantly showing itself. The pointed\r\nshoes became gradually longer during the struggles which were carried on\r\nin the reign of Philippe le Bel between Church and State.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the shoes, there were also the _estiviaux_, thus named from.\r\n_estiva_ (summer thing), because, being generally made of velvet, brocade,\r\nor other costly material, they could only be worn in dry weather.\r\n\r\n\"The coat (_cotte_) corresponded with the tunic of the ancients, it was a\r\nblouse with tight sleeves. These sleeves were the only part of it which\r\nwere exposed, the rest being completely covered by the surcoats, or\r\n_cotte-hardie,_ a name the origin of which is obscure. In shape the\r\nsurcoat somewhat resembled a sack, in which, at a later period, large\r\nslits were made in the arms, as well as over the hips and on the chest,\r\nthrough which appeared the rich furs and satins with which it was\r\nlined.... The ordinary material of the surcoat for the rich was cloth,\r\neither scarlet, blue, or reddish brown, or two or more of these colours\r\nmixed together; and for the poor, linsey-woolsey or fustian. The nobles,\r\nprinces, or barons, when holding a court, wore surcoats of a colour to\r\nmatch their arms, which were embroidered upon them, but the lesser nobles\r\nwho frequented the houses of the great spoke of themselves as in the robes\r\nof such and such a noble, because he whose patronage they courted was\r\nobliged to provide them with surcoats and mantles. These were of their\r\npatron's favourite colour, and were called the livery (_livrée_), on\r\naccount of their distribution (_livraison_), which took place twice a\r\nyear. The word has remained in use ever since, but with a different\r\nsignification; it is, however, so nearly akin to the original meaning that\r\nits affinity is evident.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418.--Costume of English Servants in the Fourteenth\r\nCentury.--From Manuscripts in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419.--Costume of Philip the Good, with Hood and\r\n\"Cockade.\"--From a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Period.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting anecdote relative to this custom is to be found in the\r\nchronicles of Matthew Paris. When St. Louis, to the dismay of all his\r\nvassals, and of his inferior servants, had decided to take up the cross,\r\nhe succeeded in associating the nobles of his court with him in his vow by\r\na kind of pious fraud. Having had a certain number of mantles prepared for\r\nChristmas-day, he had a small white cross embroidered on each above the\r\nright shoulder, and ordered them to be distributed among the nobles on the\r\nmorning of the feast when they were about to go to mass, which was\r\ncelebrated some time before sunrise. Each courtier received the mantle\r\ngiven by the King at the door of his room, and put it on in the dark\r\nwithout noticing the white cross; but, when the day broke, to his great\r\nsurprise, he saw the emblem worn by his neighbour, without knowing that he\r\nhimself wore it also. \"They were surprised and amused,\" says the English\r\nhistorian, \"at finding that the King had thus piously entrapped them....\r\nAs it would have been unbecoming, shameful, and even unworthy of them to\r\nhave removed these crosses, they laughed heartily, and said that the good\r\nKing, on starting as a pilgrim-hunter, had found a new method of catching\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The chaperon,\" adds M. Quicherat, \"was the national head-dress of the\r\nancient French, as the _cucullus_, which was its model, was that of the\r\nGauls. We can imagine its appearance by its resemblance to the domino now\r\nworn at masked balls. The shape was much varied during the reign of\r\nPhilippe le Bel, either by the diminution of the cape or by the\r\nlengthening of the hood, which was always sufficiently long to fall on the\r\nshoulders. In the first of these changes, the chaperon no longer being\r\ntied round the neck, required to be held on the head by something more\r\nsolid. For this reason it was set on a pad or roll, which changed it into\r\na regular cap. The material was so stitched as to make it take certain\r\nfolds, which were arranged as puffs, as ruffs, or in the shape of a cock's\r\ncomb; this last fashion, called _cockade_, was especially in vogue (Fig.\r\n419)--hence the origin of the French epithet _coquard_, which would be now\r\nexpressed by the word _dandy_.\r\n\r\n\"Hats were of various shapes. They were made of different kinds of felt,\r\nor of otter or goat's skin, or of wool or cotton. The expression _chapeau\r\nde fleurs_ (hat of flowers), which continually occurs in ancient works,\r\ndid not mean any form of hat, but simply a coronet of forget-me-nots or\r\nroses, which was an indispensable part of dress for balls or festivities\r\ndown to the reign of Philippe de Valois (1347). Frontlets (_fronteaux_), a\r\nspecies of fillet made of silk, covered with gold and precious stones,\r\nsuperseded the _chapeau de fleurs_, inasmuch as they had the advantage of\r\nnot fading. They also possessed the merit of being much more costly, and\r\nwere thus the means of establishing in a still more marked manner\r\ndistinctions in the social positions of the wearers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420.--Costumes of a rich Bourgeoise, of a\r\nPeasant-woman, and of a Lady of the Nobility, of the Fourteenth\r\nCentury.--From various painted Windows in the Churches of Moulins\r\n(Bourbonnais).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saint Catherine Surrounded by the Doctors of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nA miniature from the _Breviary_ of the cardinal Grimani, attributed to\r\nMemling.\r\n\r\nBibl. of Saint-Marc, Venice.\r\n\r\n(From a copy belonging to M. Ambroise Firmin-Didot.)]\r\n\r\n\"There were two kinds of mantles; one was open in front, and fell over the\r\nback, and a strap which crossed the chest held it fixed on the shoulders;\r\nthe other, enveloping the body like a bell, was slit up on the right side,\r\nand was thrown back over the left arm; it was made with a fur collar, cut\r\nin the shape of a tippet. This last has been handed down to us, and is\r\nworn by our judges under the name of _toge_ and _épitoge_.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very common mistake to suppose that the shirt is an article of\r\ndress of modern invention; on the contrary, it is one of great antiquity,\r\nand its coming into general use is the only thing new about it.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, we have to mention the _chape_, which was always regarded as a\r\nnecessary article of dress. The _chape_ was the only protection against\r\nbad weather at a period when umbrellas and covered carriages were unknown.\r\nIt was sometimes called _chape de pluie_, on account of the use to which\r\nit was applied, and it consisted of a large cape with sleeves, and was\r\ncompletely waterproof. It was borne behind a master by his servant, who,\r\non account of this service was called a _porte-chape._ It is needless to\r\nsay that the common people carried it themselves, either slung over their\r\nbacks, or folded under the arm.\"\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to female attire, we shall find represented in it all the\r\ncomponent parts of male dress, and almost all of them under the same\r\nnames. It must be remarked, however, that the women's coats and surcoats\r\noften trailed on the ground; that the hat--which was generally called a\r\n_couvre-chef,_ and consisted of a frame of wirework covered over with\r\nstuff which was embroidered or trimmed with lace--was not of a conical\r\nshape; and, lastly, that the _chaperon_, which was always made with a\r\ntippet, or _chausse_, never turned over so as to form a cap. We may add\r\nthat the use of the couvre-chef did not continue beyond the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, at which time women adopted the custom of wearing any\r\nkind of head-dress they chose, the hair being kept back by a silken net,\r\nor _crépine_, attached either to a frontlet, or to a metal fillet, or\r\nconfined by a veil of very light material, called a _mollequin_ (Fig.\r\n420).\r\n\r\nWith the aid of our learned guide we have now reached a period (end of the\r\nthirteenth century) well adapted for this general study of the dress of\r\nour ancestors, inasmuch as soon afterwards men's dress at least, and\r\nespecially that of young courtiers, became most ridiculously and even\r\nindecently exaggerated. To such an extent was this the case, that serious\r\ncalamities having befallen the French nation about this time, and its\r\nfashions having exercised a considerable influence over the whole\r\ncontinent of Europe, contemporary historians do not hesitate to regard\r\nthese public misfortunes as a providential chastisement inflicted on\r\nFrance for its disgraceful extravagance in dress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421.--Costumes of a young Nobleman and of a Bourgeois\r\nin the Fourteenth Century.--From a painted Window in the Church of\r\nSaint-Ouen at Rouen, and from a Window at Moulins (Bourbonnais).]\r\n\r\n\"We must believe that God has permitted this as a just judgment on us for\r\nour sins,\" say the monks who edited the \"Grande Chronique de St. Denis,\"\r\nin 1346, at the time of the unfortunate battle of Cressy, \"although it\r\ndoes not belong to us to judge. But what we see we testify to; for pride\r\nwas very great in France, and especially amongst the nobles and others,\r\nthat is to say, pride of nobility, and covetousness. There was also much\r\nimpropriety in dress, and this extended throughout the whole of France.\r\nSome had their clothes so short and so tight that it required the help of\r\ntwo persons to dress and undress them, and whilst they were being\r\nundressed they appeared as if they were being skinned. Others wore dresses\r\nplaited over their loins like women; some had chaperons cut out in points\r\nall round; some had tippets of one cloth, others of another; and some had\r\ntheir head-dresses and sleeves reaching to the ground, looking more like\r\nmountebanks than anything else. Considering all this, it is not surprising\r\nif God employed the King of England as a scourge to correct the excesses\r\nof the French people.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is not the only testimony to the ridiculous and extravagant\r\ntastes of this unfortunate period. One writer speaks with indignation of\r\nthe _goats' beards_ (with two points), which seemed to put the last\r\nfinishing touch of ridicule on the already grotesque appearance of even\r\nthe most serious people of that period. Another exclaims against the\r\nextravagant luxury of jewels, of gold and silver, and against the wearing\r\nof feathers, which latter then appeared for the first time as accessories\r\nto both male and female attire. Some censure, and not without reason, the\r\nabsurd fashion of converting the ancient leather girdle, meant to support\r\nthe waist, into a kind of heavy padded band, studded with gilded ornaments\r\nand precious stones, and apparently invented expressly to encumber the\r\nperson wearing it. Other contemporary writers, and amongst these Pope\r\nUrban V. and King Charles V. (Fig. 422), inveigh against the _poulaines_,\r\nwhich had more than ever come into favour, and which were only considered\r\ncorrect in fashion when they were made as a kind of appendix to the foot,\r\nmeasuring at least double its length, and ornamented in the most\r\nfantastical manner. The Pope anathematized this deformity as \"a mockery of\r\nGod and the holy Church,\" and the King forbad craftsmen to make them, and\r\nhis subjects to wear them. All this is as nothing in comparison with the\r\nprofuse extravagance displayed in furs, which was most outrageous and\r\nruinous, and of which we could not form an idea were it not for the items\r\nin certain royal documents, from which we gather that, in order to trim\r\ntwo complete suits for King John, no fewer than six hundred and seventy\r\nmartens' skins were used. It is also stated that the Duke of Berry, the\r\nyoungest son of that monarch, purchased nearly ten thousand of these same\r\nskins from a distant country in the north, in order to trim only five\r\nmantles and as many surcoats. We read also that a robe made for the Duke\r\nof Orleans, grandson of the same king, required two thousand seven hundred\r\nand ninety ermines' skins. It is unnecessary to state, that in consequence\r\nof this large consumption, skins could only be purchased at the most\r\nextravagant prices; for example, fifty skins cost about one hundred francs\r\n(or about six thousand of present currency), showing to what an enormous\r\nexpense those persons were put who desired to keep pace with the luxury of\r\nthe times (Fig. 424).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422.--Costume of Charles V., King of France.--From a\r\nStatue formerly in the Church of the Célestins, Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423.--Costume of Jeanne de Bourbon, Wife of Charles\r\nV.--From a Statue formerly in the Church of the Célestins, Paris.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Charles V. used his influence, which was\r\nunfortunately very limited, in trying to restrain the extravagance of\r\nfashion. This monarch did more than decree laws against indelicate or\r\nunseemly and ridiculous dress; he himself never wore anything but the long\r\nand ample costume, which was most becoming, and which had been adopted in\r\nthe preceding century. His example, it is true, was little followed, but\r\nit nevertheless had this happy resuit, that the advocates of short and\r\ntight dresses, as if suddenly seized with instinctive modesty, adopted an\r\nupper garment, the object of which seemed to be to conceal the absurd\r\nfashions which they had not the courage to rid themselves of. This heavy\r\nand ungraceful tunic, called a _housse_, consisted of two broad bands of\r\na more or less costly material, which, starting from the neck, fell behind\r\nand before, thus almost entirely concealing the front and back of the\r\nperson, and only allowing the under garments to be seen through the slits\r\nwhich naturally opened on each side of it.\r\n\r\nA fact worthy of remark is, that whilst male attire, through a depravity\r\nof taste, had extended to the utmost limit of extravagance, women's dress,\r\non the contrary, owing to a strenuous effort towards a dignified and\r\nelegant simplicity, became of such a character that it combined all the\r\nmost approved fashions of female costume which had been in use in former\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Queen Jeanne de Bourbon, wife of Charles V., formerly placed\r\nwith that of her husband in the Church of the Célestins at Paris, gives\r\nthe most faithful representation of this charming costume, to which our\r\nartists continually have recourse when they wish to depict any poetical\r\nscenes of the French Middle Ages (Fig. 423).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424.--Costumes of Bourgeois or Merchant, of a\r\nNobleman, and of a Lady of the Court or rich Bourgeoise, with the\r\nHead-dress (_escoffion_) of the Fifteenth Century.--From a Painted Window\r\nof the Period, at Moulins (Bourbonnais), and from a Painting on Wood of\r\nthe same Period, in the Musee de Cluny.]\r\n\r\nThis costume, without positively differing in style from that of the\r\nthirteenth century, inasmuch as it was composed of similar elements, was\r\nnevertheless to be distinguished by a degree of elegance which hitherto\r\nhad been unknown. The coat, or under garment, which formerly only showed\r\nitself through awkwardly-contrived openings, now displayed the harmonious\r\noutlines of the figure to advantage, thanks to the large openings in the\r\novercoat. The surcoat, kept back on the shoulders by two narrow bands,\r\nbecame a sort of wide and trailing skirt, which majestically draped the\r\nlower part of the body; and, lastly, the external corset was invented,\r\nwhich was a kind of short mantle, falling down before and behind without\r\nconcealing any of the fine outlines of the bust. This new article of\r\napparel, which was kept in its place in the middle of the chest by a steel\r\nbusk encased in some rich lace-work, was generally made of fur in winter\r\nand of silk in summer. If we consult the numerous miniatures in\r\nmanuscripts of this period, in which the gracefulness of the costume was\r\nheightened by the colours employed, we shall understand what variety and\r\nwhat richness of effect could be displayed without departing from the most\r\nrigid simplicity.\r\n\r\nOne word more in reference to female head-dress. The fashion of wearing\r\nfalse hair continued in great favour during the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and it gave rise to all sorts of ingenious combinations; which,\r\nhowever, always admitted of the hair being parted from the forehead to the\r\nback of the head in two equal masses, and of being plaited or waved over\r\nthe ears. Nets were again adopted, and head-dresses which, whilst\r\npermitting a display of masses of false hair, hid the horsehair or padded\r\npuffs. And, lastly, the _escoffion_ appeared--a heavy roll, which, being\r\nplaced on a cap also padded, produced the most clumsy, outrageons, and\r\nungraceful shapes (Fig. 424).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fifteenth century men's dress was still very\r\nshort. It consisted of a kind of tight waistcoat, fastened by tags, and of\r\nvery close-fitting breeches, which displayed the outlines of the figure.\r\nIn order to appear wide at the shoulders artificial pads were worn, called\r\n_mahoitres_. The hair was allowed to fall on the forehead in locks, which\r\ncovered the eyebrows and eyes. The sleeves were slashed, the shoes armed\r\nwith long metal points, and the conical hat, with turned-up rim, was\r\nornamented with gold chains and various jewels. The ladies, during the\r\nreign of Charles VI., still wore long trains to their dresses, which they\r\ncarried tucked up under their arms, unless they had pages or waiting-maids\r\n(see chapter on Ceremonials). The tendency, however, was to shorten these\r\ninconvenient trains, as well as the long hanging and embroidered or\r\nfringed sleeves. On the other hand, ladies' dresses on becoming shorter\r\nwere trimmed in the most costly manner. Their head-dresses consisted of\r\nvery large rolls, surmounted by a high conical bonnet called a _hennin_,\r\nthe introduction of which into France was attributed to Queen Isabel of\r\nBavaria, wife of Charles VI. It was at this period that they began to\r\nuncover the neck and to wear necklaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 425.--Italian Costumes of the Fifteenth Century:\r\nNotary and Sbirro.--From two Engravings in the Bonnart Collection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 426.--Costumes of a Mechanic's Wife and a rich\r\nBourgeois in the latter part of the Fifteenth Century.--From Windows in\r\nthe Cathedral of Moulins (Bourbonnais).]\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XI. this costume, already followed and adopted by the greatest\r\nslaves of fashion, became more general.\r\n\r\n\"In this year (1487),\" says the chronicler Monstrelet, \"ladies ceased to\r\nwear trains, substituting for them trimmings of grebe, of martens' fur, of\r\nvelvet, and of other materials, of about eighteen inches in width; some\r\nwore on the top of their heads rolls nearly two feet high, shaped like a\r\nround cap, which closed in above. Others wore them lower, with veils\r\nhanging from the top, and reaching down to the feet. Others wore unusually\r\nwide silk bands, with very elegant buckles equally wide, and magnificent\r\ngold necklaces of various patterns.\r\n\r\n\"About this time, too, men took to wearing shorter clothes than ever,\r\nhaving them made to fit tightly to the body, after the manner of dressing\r\nmonkeys, which was very shameful and immodest; and the sleeves of their\r\ncoats and doublets were slit open so as to show their fine white shirts.\r\nThey wore their hair so long that it concealed their face and even their\r\neyes, and on their heads they wore cloth caps nearly a foot or more high.\r\nThey also carried, according to fancy, very splendid gold chains. Knights\r\nand squires, and even the varlets, wore silk or velvet doublets; and\r\nalmost every one, especially at court, wore poulaines nine inches or more\r\nin length. They also wore under their doublets large pads (_mahoitres_),\r\nin order to appear as if they had broad shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Charles VIII. the mantle, trimmed with fur, was open in front, its\r\nfalse sleeves being slit up above in order to allow the arms of the under\r\ncoat to pass through. The cap was turned up; the breeches or long hose\r\nwere made tight-fitting. The shoes with poulaines were superseded by a\r\nkind of large padded shoe of black leather, round or square at the toes,\r\nand gored over the foot with coloured material, a fashion imported from\r\nItaly, and which was as much exaggerated in France as the poulaine had\r\nformerly been. The women continued to wear conical caps (_hennins_) of\r\ngreat height, covered with immense veils; their gowns were made with\r\ntight-fitting bodies, which thus displayed the outlines of the figure\r\n(Figs. 427 and 428).\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XII., Queen Anne invented a low head-dress--or rather it was\r\ninvented for her--consisting of strips of velvet or of black or violet\r\nsilk over other bands of white linen, which encircled the face and fell\r\ndown over the back and shoulders; the large sleeves of the dresses had a\r\nkind of turned-over borders, with trimmings of enormous width. Men adopted\r\nshort tunics, plaited and tight at the waist. The upper part of the\r\ngarments of both men and women was cut in the form of a square over the\r\nchest and shoulders, as most figures are represented in the pictures of\r\nRaphael and contemporary painters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Italian Lacework, in Gold Thread.\r\n\r\nThe cypher and arms of Henry III. (16th century.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427.--Costume of Charlotte of Savoy, second Wife of\r\nLouis XI.--From a Picture of the Period formerly in the Castle of\r\nBourbon-l'Archambault, M. de Quedeville's Collection, in Paris.

From an old Engraving in the Collection of the Imperial Library,\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Italian fashions, which in reality did not much differ\r\nfrom those which had been already adopted, but which exhibited better\r\ntaste and a greater amount of elegance, dates from the famous expedition\r\nof Charles VIII. into Italy (Figs. 429 and 430). Full and gathered or\r\npuffed sleeves, which gave considerable gracefulness to the upper part of\r\nthe body, succeeded to the _mahoitres_, which had been discarded since the\r\ntime of Louis XI. A short and ornamental mantle, a broad-brimmed hat\r\ncovered with feathers, and trunk hose, the ample dimensions of which\r\nearned for them the name of _trousses_, formed the male attire at the end\r\nof the fifteenth century. Women wore the bodies of their dresses closely\r\nfitting to the figure, embroidered, trimmed with lace, and covered with\r\ngilt ornaments; the sleeves were very large and open, and for the most\r\npart they still adhered to the heavy and ungraceful head-dress of Queen\r\nAnne of Brittany. The principal characteristic of female dress at the time\r\nwas its fulness; men's, on the contrary, with the exception of the mantle\r\nor the upper garment, was usually tight and very scanty.\r\n\r\nWe find that a distinct separation between ancient and modern dress took\r\nplace as early as the sixteenth century; in fact, our present fashions may\r\nbe said to have taken their origin from about that time. It was during\r\nthis century that men adopted clothes closely fitting to the body;\r\novercoats with tight sleeves, felt hats with more or less wide brims, and\r\nclosed shoes and boots. The women also wore their dresses closely fitting\r\nto the figure, with tight sleeves, low-crowned hats, and richly-trimmed\r\npetticoats. These garments, which differ altogether from those of\r\nantiquity, constitute, as it were, the common type from which have since\r\narisen the endless varieties of male and female dress; and there is no\r\ndoubt that fashion will thus be continually changing backwards and\r\nforwards from time to time, sometimes returning to its original model, and\r\nsometimes departing from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 429 and 430.--Costumes of Young Nobles of the Court\r\nof Charles VIII., before and after the Expedition into Italy.--From\r\nMiniatures in two Manuscripts of the Period in the National Library of\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century, ladies wore the skirts of their dresses,\r\nwhich were tight at the waist and open in front, very wide, displaying the\r\nlower part of a very rich under petticoat, which reached to the ground,\r\ncompletely concealing the feet. This, like the sleeves with puffs, which\r\nfell in circles to the wrists, was altogether an Italian fashion.\r\nFrequently the hair was turned over in rolls, and adorned with precious\r\nstones, and was surmounted by a small cap, coquettishly placed either on\r\none side or on the top of the head, and ornamented with gold chains,\r\njewels, and feathers. The body of the dress was always long, and pointed\r\nin front. Men wore their coats cut somewhat after the same shape: their\r\ntrunk hose were tight, but round the waist they were puffed out. They wore\r\na cloak, which only reached as far as the hips, and was always much\r\nornamented; they carried a smooth or ribbed cap on one side of the head,\r\nand a small upright collar adorned the coat. This collar was replaced,\r\nafter the first half of the sixteenth century, by the high, starched ruff,\r\nwhich was kept out by wires; ladies wore it still larger, when it had\r\nsomewhat the appearance of an open fan at the back of the neck.\r\n\r\nIf we take a retrospective glance at the numerous changes of costume which\r\nwe have endeavoured to describe in this hurried sketch, we shall find that\r\namongst European nations, during the Middle Ages, there was but one common\r\nstandard of fashion, which varied from time to time according to the\r\nparticular custom of each country, and according to the peculiarities of\r\neach race. In Italy, for instance, dress always maintained a certain\r\ncharacter of grandeur, ever recalling the fact that the influence of\r\nantiquity was not quite lost. In Germany and Switzerland, garments had\r\ngenerally a heavy and massive appearance; in Holland, still more so (Figs.\r\n436 and 437). England uniformly studied a kind of instinctive elegance and\r\npropriety. It is a curious fact that Spain invariably partook of the\r\nheaviness peculiar to Germany, either because the Gothic element still\r\nprevailed there, or that the Walloon fashions had a special attraction to\r\nher owing to associations and general usage. France was then, as it is\r\nnow, fickle and capricious, fantastical and wavering, but not from\r\nindifference, but because she was always ready to borrow from every\r\nquarter anything which pleased her. She, however, never failed to put her\r\nown stamp on whatever she adopted, thus making any fashion essentially\r\nFrench, even though she had only just borrowed it from Spain, England,\r\nGermany, or Italy. In all these countries we have seen, and still see,\r\nentire provinces adhering to some ancient costume, causing them to differ\r\naltogether in character from the rest of the nation. This is simply owing\r\nto the fact that the fashions have become obsolete in the neighbouring\r\nplaces, for every local costume faithfully and rigorously preserved by any\r\ncommunity at a distance from the centre of political action or government,\r\nmust have been originally brought there by the nobles of the country. Thus\r\nthe head-dress of Anne of Brittany is still that of the peasant-women of\r\nPenhoét and of Labrevack, and the _hennin_ of Isabel of Bavaria is still\r\nthe head-dress of Normandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431.--Costumes of a Nobleman or a very rich\r\nBourgeois, of a Bourgeois or Merchant, and of a Noble Lady or rich\r\nBourgeoise, of the Time of Louis XII.--From Miniatures in Manuscripts of\r\nthe Period, in the Imperial Library of Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432.--Costume of a rich Bourgeoise, and of a Noble,\r\nor Person of Distinction, of the Time of Francis I.--From a Window in the\r\nChurch of St. Ouen at Rouen, by Gaignières (National Library of Paris).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the subject has reached the limits we have by the very nature of\r\nthis work assigned to it, we think it well to overstep them somewhat, in\r\norder briefly to indicate the last connecting link between modern fashions\r\nand those of former periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 433 and 434.--Costumes of the Ladies and Damsels of\r\nthe Court of Catherine de Medicis.--After Cesare Vecellio.]\r\n\r\nUnder Francis I., the costumes adopted from Italy remained almost\r\nstationary (Fig. 432). Under Henri II. (Figs. 433 and 434), and especially\r\nafter the death of that prince, the taste for frivolities made immense\r\nprogress, and the style of dress in ordinary use seemed day by day to lose\r\nthe few traces of dignity which it had previously possessed.\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medicis had introduced into France the fashion of ruffs, and\r\nat the beginning of the fourteenth century, Marie de Medicis that of\r\nsmall collars. Dresses tight at the waist began to be made very full round\r\nthe hips, by means of large padded rolls, and these were still more\r\nenlarged, under the name of _vertugadins_ (corrupted from\r\n_vertu-gardiens),_ by a monstrous arrangement of padded whalebone and\r\nsteel, which subsequently became the ridiculous _paniers_, which were worn\r\nalmost down to the commencement of the present century; and the fashion\r\nseems likely to come into vogue again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435.--Costume of a Gentleman of the French Court, of\r\nthe End of the Sixteenth Century.--Fac-simile of a Miniature in the \"Livre\r\nde Poésies,\" Manuscript dedicated to Henry IV.]\r\n\r\nUnder the last of the Valois, men's dress was short, the jacket was\r\npointed and trimmed round with small peaks, the velvet cap was trimmed\r\nwith aigrettes; the beard was pointed, a pearl hung from the left ear, and\r\na small cloak or mantle was carried on the shoulder, which only reached to\r\nthe waist. The use of gloves made of scented leather became universal.\r\nLadies wore their dresses long, very full, and very costly, little or no\r\nchange being made in these respects during the reign of Henry IV. At this\r\nperiod, the men's high hose were made longer and fuller, especially in\r\nSpain and the Low Countries, and the fashion of large soft boots, made of\r\ndoeskin or of black morocco, became universal, on account of their being\r\nso comfortable.\r\n\r\nWe may remark that the costume of the bourgeois was for a long time\r\nalmost unchanged, even in the towns. Never having adopted either the\r\ntight-fitting hose or the balloon trousers, they wore an easy jerkin, a\r\nlarge cloak, and a felt hat, which the English made conical and with a\r\nbroad brim.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the seventeenth century, the high hose which were\r\nworn by the northern nations, profusely trimmed, was transformed into the\r\n_culotte_, which was full and open at the knees. A division was thus\r\nsuddenly made between the lower and the upper part of the hose, as if the\r\ngarment which covered the lower limbs had been cut in two, and garters\r\nwere then necessarily invented. The felt hat became over almost the whole\r\nof Europe a cap, taking the exact form of the head, and having a wide,\r\nflat brim turned up on one side. High heels were added to boots and shoes,\r\nwhich up to that time had been flat and with single soles.... Two\r\ncenturies later, a terrible social agitation took place all over Europe,\r\nafter which male attire became mean, ungraceful, plain and more paltry\r\nthan ever; whereas female dress, the fashions of which were perpetually\r\nchanging from day to day, became graceful and elegant, though too often\r\napproaching to the extravagant and absurd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 436 and 437.--Costumes of the German Bourgeoisie in\r\nthe Middle of the Sixteenth Century.--Drawings attributed to Holbein.]",
