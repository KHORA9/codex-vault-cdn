APPLETON AND COMPANY,\r\n549 & 551 BROADWAY.\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIR JOHN FREDERICK WILLIAM HERSCHEL,\r\nK.G.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HERSCHEL,\r\nIT is with no common pleasure that I take up my pen to dedicate\r\nthese volumes to you. They are the result of trains of thought which\r\nhave often been the subject of our conversation, and of which the\r\norigin goes back to the period of our early companionship at the\r\nUniversity. And if I had ever wavered in my purpose of combining\r\nsuch reflections and researches into a whole, I should have derived\r\na renewed impulse and increased animation from your delightful\r\nDiscourse on a kindred subject. For I could not have read it without\r\nfinding this portion of philosophy invested with a fresh charm; and\r\nthough I might be well aware that I could not aspire to that large\r\nshare of popularity which your work so justly gained, I should still\r\nhave reflected, that something was due to the subject itself, and\r\nshould have hoped that my own aim was so far similar to yours, that\r\nthe present work might have a chance of exciting an interest in some\r\nof your readers. That it will interest you, I do not at all hesitate\r\nto believe.\r\n\r\nIf you were now in England I should stop here: but when a friend is\r\nremoved for years to a far distant land, we seem to acquire a right\r\nto speak openly of his good qualities. I cannot, therefore, prevail\r\nupon myself to lay down my pen without alluding to the affectionate\r\nadmiration of your moral and social, as well as intellectual\r\nexcellencies, which springs up in the hearts of your friends,\r\nwhenever you are thought of. They are much delighted to look upon\r\nthe halo of deserved fame which plays round your head but still\r\nmore, to recollect, {6} as one of them said, that your head is far\r\nfrom being the best part about you.\r\n\r\nMay your sojourn in the southern hemisphere be as happy and\r\nsuccessful as its object is noble and worthy of you; and may your\r\nreturn home be speedy and prosperous, as soon as your purpose is\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Herschel, yours,\r\n\r\nW. WHEWELL.\r\nMarch 22, 1837.\r\n\r\nP.S. So I wrote nearly ten years ago, when you were at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, employed in your great task of making a complete standard\r\nsurvey of the nebulæ and double stars visible to man. Now that you\r\nare, as I trust, in a few weeks about to put the crowning stone upon\r\nyour edifice by the publication of your \"Observations in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere,\" I cannot refrain from congratulating you upon\r\nhaving had your life ennobled by the conception and happy execution\r\nof so great a design, and once more offering you my wishes that you\r\nmay long enjoy the glory you have so well won.\r\n\r\nW. W.\r\nTRINITY COLLEGE, NOV. 22, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{7}}\r\nPREFACE\r\nTO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the Prefaces to the previous Editions of this work, several\r\nremarks were made which it is not necessary now to repeat to the\r\nsame extent. That a History of the Sciences, executed as this is,\r\nhas some value in the eyes of the Public, is sufficiently proved by\r\nthe circulation which it has obtained. I am still able to say that I\r\nhave seen no objection urged against the plan of the work, and\r\nscarcely any against the details. The attempt to throw the history\r\nof each science into EPOCHS at which some great and cardinal\r\ndiscovery was made, and to arrange the subordinate events of each\r\nhistory as belonging to the PRELUDES and the SEQUELS of such Epochs,\r\nappears to be assented to, as conveniently and fairly exhibiting the\r\nprogress of scientific truth. Such a view being assumed, as it was a\r\nconstant light and guide to the writer in his task, so will it also,\r\nI think, make the view of the reader far more clear and\r\ncomprehensive than it could otherwise be. With regard to the manner\r\nin which this plan has been carried into effect with reference to\r\nparticular writers and their researches, as I have said, I have seen\r\nscarcely any objection made. I was aware, as I stated at the outset,\r\nof the difficulty and delicacy of the office which I had undertaken;\r\nbut I had various considerations to encourage me to go through it;\r\nand I had a trust, which I {8} have as yet seen nothing to disturb,\r\nthat I should be able to speak impartially of the great scientific\r\nmen of all ages, even of our own.\r\n\r\nI have already said, in the Introduction, that the work aimed at\r\nbeing, not merely a narration of the facts in the history of\r\nScience, but a basis for the Philosophy of Science. It seemed to me\r\nthat our study of the modes of discovering truth ought to be based\r\nupon a survey of the truths which have been discovered. This maxim,\r\nso stated, seems sufficiently self-evident; yet it has, even up to\r\nthe present time, been very rarely acted on. Those who discourse\r\nconcerning the nature of Truth and the mode of its discovery, still,\r\ncommonly, make for themselves examples of truths, which for the most\r\npart are utterly frivolous and unsubstantial (as in most Treatises\r\non Logic); or else they dig up, over and over, the narrow and\r\nspecial field of mathematical truth, which certainly cannot, of\r\nitself, exemplify the general mode by which man has attained to the\r\nvast body of certain truth which he now possesses.\r\n\r\nYet it must not be denied that the Ideas which form the basis of\r\nMathematical Truth are concerned in the formation of Scientific\r\nTruth in general; and discussions concerning these Ideas are by no\r\nmeans necessarily barren of advantage. But it must be borne in mind\r\nthat, besides these Ideas, there are also others, which no less lie\r\nat the root of Scientific Truth; and concerning which there have\r\nbeen, at various periods, discussions which have had an important\r\nbearing on the progress of Scientific Truth;--such as discussions\r\nconcerning the nature and necessary attributes of Matter, of Force,\r\nof Atoms, of Mediums, of Kinds, of Organization. The controversies\r\nwhich have taken place concerning these have an important place in\r\nthe history of Natural Science in {9} its most extended sense. Yet\r\nit appeared convenient to carry on the history of Science, so far as\r\nit depends on Observation, in a line separate from these discussions\r\nconcerning Ideas. The account of these discussions and the\r\nconsequent controversies, therefore, though it be thoroughly\r\nhistorical, and, as appears to me, a very curious and interesting\r\nhistory, is reserved for the other work, the _Philosophy of the\r\nInductive Sciences_. Such a history has, in truth, its natural place\r\nin the Philosophy of Science; for the Philosophy of Science at the\r\npresent day must contain the result and summing up of all the truth\r\nwhich has been disentangled from error and confusion during these\r\npast controversies.\r\n\r\nI have made a few Additions to the present Edition; partly, with a\r\nview of bringing up the history, at least of some of the Sciences,\r\nto the present time,--so far as those larger features of the History\r\nof Science are concerned, with which alone I have here to deal,--and\r\npartly also, especially in the First Volume, in order to rectify and\r\nenlarge some of the earlier portions of the history. Several works\r\nwhich have recently appeared suggested reconsideration of various\r\npoints; and I hoped that my readers might be interested in the\r\nreflections so suggested.\r\n\r\nI will add a few sentences from the Preface to the First Edition.\r\n\r\n\"As will easily be supposed, I have borrowed largely from other\r\nwriters, both of the histories of special sciences and of philosophy\r\nin general.[1\\P] I have done this without {10} scruple, since the\r\nnovelty of my work was intended to consist, not in its superiority\r\nas a collection of facts, but in the point of view in which the\r\nfacts were placed. I have, however, in all cases, given references\r\nto my authorities, and there are very few instances in which I have\r\nnot verified the references of previous historians, and studied the\r\noriginal authors. According to the plan which I have pursued, the\r\nhistory of each science forms a whole in itself, divided into\r\ndistinct but connected members, by the _Epochs_ of its successive\r\nadvances. If I have satisfied the competent judges in each science\r\nby my selection of such epochs, the scheme of the work must be of\r\npermanent value, however imperfect may be the execution of any of\r\nits portions.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\P: Among these, I may mention as works to which I have\r\npeculiar obligations, Tennemann's Geschichte der Philosophie;\r\nDegerando's Histoire Comparée des Systèmes de Philosophie;\r\nMontucla's Histoire des Mathématiques, with Delalande's continuation\r\nof it; Delambre's Astronomie Ancienne, Astronomie du Moyen Age,\r\nAstronomie Moderne, and Astronomie du Dix-huitième Siècle; Bailly's\r\nHistoire d'Astronomie Ancienne, and Histoire d'Astronomie Moderne;\r\nVoiron's Histoire d'Astronomie (published as a continuation of\r\nBailly), Fischer's Geschichte der Physik, Gmelin's Geschichte der\r\nChemie, Thomson's History of Chemistry, Sprengel's History of\r\nMedicine, his History of Botany, and in all branches of Natural\r\nHistory and Physiology, Cuvier's works; in their historical, as in\r\nall other portions, most admirable and instructive.]\r\n\r\n\"With all these grounds of hope, it is still impossible not to see\r\nthat such an undertaking is, in no small degree, arduous, and its\r\nevent obscure. But all who venture upon such tasks must gather trust\r\nand encouragement from reflections like those by which their great\r\nforerunner prepared himself for his endeavors;--by recollecting that\r\nthey are aiming to advance the best interests and privileges of man;\r\nand that they may expect all the best and wisest of men to join them\r\nin their aspirations and to aid them in their labors.\r\n\r\n\"'Concerning ourselves we speak not; but as touching the matter\r\nwhich we have in hand, this we ask;--that men deem it not to be the\r\nsetting up of an Opinion, but the performing of a Work; and that\r\nthey receive this as a certainty--that we are not laying the\r\nfoundations of any sect or doctrine, but of the profit and dignity\r\nof mankind:--Furthermore, {11} that being well disposed to what\r\nshall advantage themselves, and putting off factions and prejudices,\r\nthey take common counsel with us, to the end that being by these our\r\naids and appliances freed and defended from wanderings and\r\nimpediments, they may lend their hands also to the labors which\r\nremain to be performed:--And yet, further, that they be of good\r\nhope; neither feign and imagine to themselves this our Reform as\r\nsomething of infinite dimension and beyond the grasp of mortal man,\r\nwhen, in truth, it is, of infinite error, the end and true limit;\r\nand is by no means unmindful of the condition of mortality and\r\nhumanity, not confiding that such a thing can be carried to its\r\nperfect close in the space of one single day, but assigning it as a\r\ntask to a succession of generations.'--BACON--INSTAURATIO MAGNA,\r\n_Præf. ad fin._\r\n\r\n\"'If there be any man who has it at heart, not merely to take his\r\nstand on what has already been discovered, but to profit by that,\r\nand to go on to something beyond;--not to conquer an adversary by\r\ndisputing, but to conquer nature by working;--not to opine probably\r\nand prettily, but to know certainly and demonstrably;--let such, as\r\nbeing true sons of nature (if they will consent to do so), join\r\nthemselves to us; so that, leaving the porch of nature which endless\r\nmultitudes have so long trod, we may at last open a way to the inner\r\ncourts. And that we may mark the two ways, that old one, and our new\r\none, by familiar names, we have been wont to call the one the\r\n_Anticipation of the Mind_, the other, the _Interpretation of\r\nNature_.'--INST.

I shall thus have to trace some of the most remarkable\r\nbranches of human knowledge, from their first germ to their growth\r\ninto a vast and varied assemblage of undisputed truths; from the\r\nacute, but fruitless, essays of the early Greek Philosophy, to the\r\ncomprehensive systems, and demonstrated generalizations, which\r\ncompose such sciences as the Mechanics, Astronomy, and Chemistry, of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nThe completeness of historical view which belongs to such a design,\r\nconsists, not in accumulating all the details of the cultivation of\r\neach science, but in marking the larger features of its formation.\r\nThe historian must endeavor to point out how each of the important\r\nadvances was made, by which the sciences have reached their present\r\nposition; and when and by whom each of the valuable truths was\r\nobtained, of which the aggregate now constitutes a costly treasure.\r\n\r\nSuch a task, if fitly executed, must have a well-founded interest\r\nfor all those who look at the existing condition of human knowledge\r\nwith complacency and admiration. The present generation finds itself\r\nthe heir of a vast patrimony of science; and it must needs concern\r\nus to know the steps by which these possessions were acquired, and\r\nthe documents by which they are secured to us and our heirs forever.\r\nOur species, from the time of its creation, has been travelling\r\nonwards in pursuit of truth; and now that we have reached a lofty\r\nand commanding position, with the broad light of day around us, it\r\nmust be grateful to look back on the line of our vast progress;--to\r\nreview the journey, begun in early twilight amid primeval wilds; for\r\na long time continued with slow advance and obscure prospects; and\r\ngradually and in later days followed along more open and lightsome\r\npaths, in a wide and fertile region. The historian of science, from\r\nearly periods to the present times, may hope for favor on the score\r\nof the mere subject of his narrative, and in virtue of the curiosity\r\nwhich the men {42} of the present day may naturally feel respecting\r\nthe events and persons of his story.\r\n\r\nBut such a survey may possess also an interest of another kind; it\r\nmay be instructive as well as agreeable; it may bring before the\r\nreader the present form and extent, the future hopes and prospects\r\nof science, as well as its past progress. The eminence on which we\r\nstand may enable us to see the land of promise, as well as the\r\nwilderness through which we have passed. The examination of the\r\nsteps by which our ancestors acquired our intellectual estate, may\r\nmake us acquainted with our expectations as well as our\r\npossessions;--may not only remind us of what we have, but may teach\r\nus how to improve and increase our store. It will be universally\r\nexpected that a History of Inductive Science should point out to us\r\na philosophical distribution of the existing body of knowledge, and\r\nafford us some indication of the most promising mode of directing\r\nour future efforts to add to its extent and completeness.\r\n\r\nTo deduce such lessons from the past history of human knowledge, was\r\nthe intention which originally gave rise to the present work. Nor is\r\nthis portion of the design in any measure abandoned; but its\r\nexecution, if it take place, must be attempted in a separate and\r\nfuture treatise, _On the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_. An\r\nessay of this kind may, I trust, from the progress already made in\r\nit, be laid before the public at no long interval after the present\r\nhistory.[1\\1]\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\1: The _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_ was published\r\nshortly after the present work.]\r\n\r\nThough, therefore, many of the principles and maxims of such a work\r\nwill disclose themselves with more or less of distinctness in the\r\ncourse of the history on which we are about to enter, the systematic\r\nand complete exposition of such principles must be reserved for this\r\nother treatise. My attempts and reflections have led me to the\r\nopinion, that justice cannot be done to the subject without such a\r\ndivision of it.\r\n\r\nTo this future work, then, I must refer the reader who is disposed\r\nto require, at the outset, a precise explanation of the terms which\r\noccur in my title. It is not possible, without entering into this\r\nphilosophy, to explain adequately how science which is INDUCTIVE\r\ndiffers from that which is not so; or why some portions of\r\n_knowledge_ may properly be selected from the general mass and\r\ntermed SCIENCE. It will be sufficient at present to say, that the\r\nsciences of which we have {43} here to treat, are those which are\r\ncommonly known as the _Physical Sciences_; and that by _Induction_\r\nis to be understood that process of collecting general truths from\r\nthe examination of particular facts, by which such sciences have\r\nbeen formed.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two or three remarks, of which the application\r\nwill occur so frequently, and will tend so much to give us a clearer\r\nview of some of the subjects which occur in our history, that I will\r\nstate them now in a brief and general manner.\r\n\r\n_Facts and Ideas_.[2\\1]--In the first place then, I remark, that, to\r\nthe formation of science, two things are requisite;--Facts and\r\nIdeas; observation of Things without, and an inward effort of\r\nThought; or, in other words, Sense and Reason. Neither of these\r\nelements, by itself can constitute substantial general knowledge.\r\nThe impressions of sense, unconnected by some rational and\r\nspeculative principle, can only end in a practical acquaintance with\r\nindividual objects; the operations of the rational faculties, on the\r\nother hand, if allowed to go on without a constant reference to\r\nexternal things, can lead only to empty abstraction and barren\r\ningenuity. Real speculative knowledge demands the combination of the\r\ntwo ingredients;--right reason, and facts to reason upon. It has\r\nbeen well said, that true knowledge is the interpretation of nature;\r\nand therefore it requires both the interpreting mind, and nature for\r\nits subject; both the document, and the ingenuity to read it aright.\r\nThus invention, acuteness, and connection of thought, are necessary\r\non the one hand, for the progress of philosophical knowledge; and on\r\nthe other hand, the precise and steady application of these\r\nfaculties to facts well known and clearly conceived. It is easy to\r\npoint out instances in which science has failed to advance, in\r\nconsequence of the absence of one or other of these requisites;\r\nindeed, by far the greater part of the course of the world, the\r\nhistory of most times and most countries, exhibits a condition thus\r\nstationary with respect to knowledge. The facts, the impressions on\r\nthe senses, on which the first successful attempts at physical\r\nknowledge proceeded, were as well known long before the time when\r\nthey were thus turned to account, as at that period. The motions of\r\nthe stars, and the effects of weight, were familiar to man before\r\nthe rise of the Greek Astronomy and Mechanics: but the \"diviner\r\nmind\" was still absent; the act of thought had not been exerted, by\r\nwhich these facts were bound together under the form of laws and\r\nprinciples. And even at {44} this day, the tribes of uncivilized and\r\nhalf-civilized man, over the whole face of the earth, have before\r\ntheir eyes a vast body of facts, of exactly the same nature as those\r\nwith which Europe has built the stately fabric of her physical\r\nphilosophy; but, in almost every other part of the earth, the\r\nprocess of the intellect by which these facts become science, is\r\nunknown. The scientific faculty does not work. The scattered stones\r\nare there, but the builder's hand is wanting. And again, we have no\r\nlack of proof that mere activity of thought is equally inefficient\r\nin producing real knowledge. Almost the whole of the career of the\r\nGreek schools of philosophy; of the schoolmen of Europe in the\r\nmiddle ages; of the Arabian and Indian philosophers; shows us that\r\nwe may have extreme ingenuity and subtlety, invention and\r\nconnection, demonstration and method; and yet that out of these\r\ngerms, no physical science may be developed. We may obtain, by such\r\nmeans, Logic and Metaphysics, and even Geometry and Algebra; but out\r\nof such materials we shall never form Mechanics and Optics,\r\nChemistry and Physiology. How impossible the formation of these\r\nsciences is without a constant and careful reference to observation\r\nand experiment;--how rapid and prosperous their progress may be when\r\nthey draw from such sources the materials on which the mind of the\r\nphilosopher employs itself;--the history of those branches of\r\nknowledge for the last three hundred years abundantly teaches us.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\1: For the _Antithesis of Facts and Ideas_, see the\r\n_Philosophy_, book i. ch. 1, 2, 4, 5.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the existence of clear Ideas applied to distinct Facts\r\nwill be discernible in the History of Science, whenever any marked\r\nadvance takes place. And, in tracing the progress of the various\r\nprovinces of knowledge which come under our survey, it will be\r\nimportant for us to see that, at all such epochs, such a combination\r\nhas occurred; that whenever any material step in general knowledge\r\nhas been made,--whenever any philosophical discovery arrests our\r\nattention,--some man or men come before us, who have possessed, in\r\nan eminent degree, a clearness of the ideas which belong to the\r\nsubject in question, and who have applied such ideas in a vigorous\r\nand distinct manner to ascertained facts and exact observations. We\r\nshall never proceed through any considerable range of our narrative,\r\nwithout having occasion to remind the reader of this reflection.\r\n\r\n_Successive Steps in Science_.[3\\1]--But there is another remark\r\nwhich we must also make. Such sciences as we have here to do with\r\nare, {45} commonly, not formed by a single act;--they are not\r\ncompleted by the discovery of one great principle. On the contrary,\r\nthey consist in a long-continued advance; a series of changes; a\r\nrepeated progress from one principle to another, different and often\r\napparently contradictory. Now, it is important to remember that this\r\ncontradiction is apparent only. The principles which constituted the\r\ntriumph of the preceding stages of the science, may appear to be\r\nsubverted and ejected by the later discoveries, but in fact they are\r\n(so far as they were true) taken up in the subsequent doctrines and\r\nincluded in them. They continue to be an essential part of the\r\nscience. The earlier truths are not expelled but absorbed, not\r\ncontradicted but extended; and the history of each science, which\r\nmay thus appear like a succession of revolutions, is, in reality, a\r\nseries of developments. In the intellectual, as in the material\r\nworld,\r\n\r\n  Omnia mutantur nil interit . . . . .\r\n  Nec manet ut fuerat nec formas servat easdem,\r\n  Sed tamen ipsa eadem est.\r\n\r\n  All changes, naught is lost; the forms are changed,\r\n  And that which has been is not what it was,\r\n  Yet that which has been is.\r\n\r\nNothing which was done was useless or unessential, though it ceases\r\nto be conspicuous and primary.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\1: Concerning _Successive Generalizations in Science_ see\r\nthe _Philosophy_, book i. ch. 2, sect. 11.]\r\n\r\nThus the final form of each science contains the substance of each\r\nof its preceding modifications; and all that was at any antecedent\r\nperiod discovered and established, ministers to the ultimate\r\ndevelopment of its proper branch of knowledge. Such previous\r\ndoctrines may require to be made precise and definite, to have their\r\nsuperfluous and arbitrary portions expunged, to be expressed in new\r\nlanguage, to be taken up into the body of science by various\r\nprocesses;--but they do not on such accounts cease to be true\r\ndoctrines, or to form a portion of the essential constituents of our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n_Terms record Discoveries_.[4\\1]--The modes in which the earlier\r\ntruths of science are preserved in its later forms, are indeed\r\nvarious. From being asserted at first as strange discoveries, such\r\ntruths come at last to be implied as almost self-evident axioms.\r\nThey are recorded by some familiar maxim, or perhaps by some new\r\nword or phrase, which becomes part of the current language of the\r\nphilosophical world; and thus asserts a principle, while it appears\r\nmerely to indicate a transient {46} notion;--preserves as well as\r\nexpresses a truth;--and, like a medal of gold, is a treasure as well\r\nas a token. We shall frequently have to notice the manner in which\r\ngreat discoveries thus stamp their impress upon the terms of a\r\nscience; and, like great political revolutions, are recorded by the\r\nchange of the current coin which has accompanied them.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\1: Concerning _Technical Terms_, see _Philosophy_, book i.\r\nch. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Generalization_.--The great changes which thus take place in the\r\nhistory of science, the revolutions of the intellectual world, have,\r\nas a usual and leading character, this, that they are steps of\r\n_generalization_; transitions from particular truths to others of a\r\nwider extent, in which the former are included. This progress of\r\nknowledge, from individual facts to universal laws,--from particular\r\npropositions to general ones,--and from these to others still more\r\ngeneral, with reference to which the former generalizations are\r\nparticular,--is so far familiar to men's minds, that, without here\r\nentering into further explanation, its nature will be understood\r\nsufficiently to prepare the reader to recognize the exemplifications\r\nof such a process, which he will find at every step of our advance.\r\n\r\n_Inductive Epochs; Preludes; Sequels_.--In our history, it is the\r\n_progress_ of knowledge only which we have to attend to. This is the\r\nmain action of our drama; and all the events which do not bear upon\r\nthis, though they may relate to the cultivation and the cultivators\r\nof philosophy, are not a necessary part of our theme. Our narrative\r\nwill therefore consist mainly of successive steps of generalization,\r\nsuch as have just been mentioned. But among these, we shall find\r\nsome of eminent and decisive importance, which have more peculiarly\r\ninfluenced the fortunes of physical philosophy, and to which we may\r\nconsider the rest as subordinate and auxiliary. These primary\r\nmovements, when the Inductive process, by which science is formed,\r\nhas been exercised in a more energetic and powerful manner, may be\r\ndistinguished as the _Inductive Epochs_ of scientific history; and\r\nthey deserve our more express and pointed notice. They are, for the\r\nmost part, marked by the great discoveries and the great\r\nphilosophical names which all civilized nations have agreed in\r\nadmiring. But, when we examine more clearly the history of such\r\ndiscoveries, we find that these epochs have not occurred suddenly\r\nand without preparation. They have been preceded by a period, which\r\nwe may call their _Prelude_ during which the ideas and facts on\r\nwhich they turned were called into action;--were gradually evolved\r\ninto clearness and connection, permanency and certainty; till at\r\nlast the discovery which marks the epoch, seized and fixed forever\r\nthe truth which had till then been obscurely and {47} doubtfully\r\ndiscerned. And again, when this step has been made by the principal\r\ndiscoverers, there may generally be observed another period, which\r\nwe may call the _Sequel_ of the Epoch, during which the discovery\r\nhas acquired a more perfect certainty and a more complete\r\ndevelopment among the leaders of the advance; has been diffused to\r\nthe wider throng of the secondary cultivators of such knowledge, and\r\ntraced into its distant consequences. This is a work, always of time\r\nand labor, often of difficulty and conflict. To distribute the\r\nHistory of science into such Epochs, with their Preludes and\r\nSequels, if successfully attempted, must needs make the series and\r\nconnections of its occurrences more distinct and intelligible. Such\r\nperiods form resting-places, where we pause till the dust of the\r\nconfused march is laid, and the prospect of the path is clear.\r\n\r\n_Inductive Charts_.[5\\1]--Since the advance of science consists in\r\ncollecting by induction true general laws from particular facts, and\r\nin combining several such laws into one higher generalization, in\r\nwhich they still retain their truth; we might form a Chart, or\r\nTable, of the progress of each science, by setting down the\r\nparticular facts which have thus been combined, so as to form\r\ngeneral truths, and by marking the further union of these general\r\ntruths into others more comprehensive. The Table of the progress of\r\nany science would thus resemble the Map of a River, in which the\r\nwaters from separate sources unite and make rivulets, which again\r\nmeet with rivulets from other fountains, and thus go on forming by\r\ntheir junction trunks of a higher and higher order. The\r\nrepresentation of the state of a science in this form, would\r\nnecessarily exhibit all the principal doctrines of the science; for\r\neach general truth contains the particular truths from which it was\r\nderived, and may be followed backwards till we have these before us\r\nin their separate state. And the last and most advanced\r\ngeneralization would have, in such a scheme, its proper place and\r\nthe evidence of its validity. Hence such an _Inductive Table_ of\r\neach science would afford a criterion of the correctness of our\r\ndistribution of the inductive Epochs, by its coincidence with the\r\nviews of the best judges, as to the substantial contents of the\r\nscience in question. By forming, therefore, such Inductive Tables of\r\nthe principal sciences of which I have here to speak, and by\r\nregulating by these tables, my views of the history of the sciences,\r\nI conceive that I have secured the distribution of my {48} history\r\nfrom material error; for no merely arbitrary division of the events\r\ncould satisfy such conditions. But though I have constructed such\r\ncharts to direct the course of the present history, I shall not\r\ninsert them in the work, reserving them for the illustration of the\r\nphilosophy of the subject; for to this they more properly belong,\r\nbeing a part of the _Logic of Induction_.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\1: Inductive charts of the History of Astronomy and of\r\nOptics, such as are here referred to, are given in the _Philosophy_,\r\nbook xi. ch. 6.]\r\n\r\n_Stationary Periods_.--By the lines of such maps the real advance of\r\nscience is depicted, and nothing else. But there are several\r\noccurrences of other kinds, too interesting and too instructive to\r\nbe altogether omitted. In order to understand the conditions of the\r\nprogress of knowledge, we must attend, in some measure, to the\r\nfailures as well as the successes by which such attempts have been\r\nattended. When we reflect during how small a portion of the whole\r\nhistory of human speculations, science has really been, in any\r\nmarked degree, progressive, we must needs feel some curiosity to\r\nknow what was doing in these _stationary_ periods; what field could\r\nbe found which admitted of so wide a deviation, or at least so\r\nprotracted a wandering. It is highly necessary to our purpose, to\r\ndescribe the baffled enterprises as well as the achievements of\r\nhuman speculation.\r\n\r\n_Deduction_.--During a great part of such stationary periods, we\r\nshall find that the process which we have spoken of as essential to\r\nthe formation of real science, the conjunction of clear Ideas with\r\ndistinct Facts, was interrupted; and, in such cases, men dealt with\r\nideas alone. They employed themselves in reasoning from principles,\r\nand they arranged, and classified, and analyzed their ideas, so as\r\nto make their reasonings satisfy the requisitions of our rational\r\nfaculties. This process of drawing conclusions from our principles,\r\nby rigorous and unimpeachable trains of demonstration, is termed\r\n_Deduction_. In its due place, it is a highly important part of\r\nevery science; but it has no value when the fundamental principles,\r\non which the whole of the demonstration rests, have not first been\r\nobtained by the induction of facts, so as to supply the materials of\r\nsubstantial truth. Without such materials, a series of\r\ndemonstrations resembles physical science only as a shadow resembles\r\na real object. To give a real significance to our propositions,\r\nInduction must provide what Deduction cannot supply. From a pictured\r\nhook we can hang only a pictured chain.\r\n\r\n_Distinction of common Notions and Scientific Ideas_.[6\\1]--When the\r\n{49} notions with which men are conversant in the common course of\r\npractical life, which give meaning to their familiar language, and\r\nemployment to their hourly thoughts, are compared with the Ideas on\r\nwhich exact science is founded, we find that the two classes of\r\nintellectual operations have much that is common and much that is\r\ndifferent. Without here attempting fully to explain this relation\r\n(which, indeed, is one of the hardest problems of our philosophy),\r\nwe may observe that they have this in common, that both are acquired\r\nby acts of the mind exercised in connecting external impressions,\r\nand may be employed in conducting a train of reasoning; or, speaking\r\nloosely (for we cannot here pursue the subject so as to arrive at\r\nphilosophical exactness), we may say, that all notions and ideas are\r\nobtained by an _inductive_, and may be used in a _deductive_\r\nprocess. But scientific Ideas and common Notions differ in this,\r\nthat the former are precise and stable, the latter vague and\r\nvariable; the former are possessed with clear insight, and employed\r\nin a sense rigorously limited, and always identically the same; the\r\nlatter have grown up in the mind from a thousand dim and diverse\r\nsuggestions, and the obscurity and incongruity which belong to their\r\norigin hang about all their applications. Scientific Ideas can often\r\nbe adequately exhibited for all the purposes of reasoning, by means\r\nof Definitions and Axioms; all attempts to reason by means of\r\nDefinitions from common Notions, lead to empty forms or entire\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\1: Scientific Ideas depend upon certain _Fundamental Ideas_,\r\nwhich are enumerated in the _Philosophy_, book i. ch. 8.]\r\n\r\nSuch common Notions are sufficient for the common practical conduct\r\nof human life: but man is not a practical creature merely; he has\r\nwithin him a _speculative_ tendency, a pleasure in the contemplation\r\nof ideal relations, a love of knowledge as knowledge. It is this\r\nspeculative tendency which brings to light the difference of common\r\nNotions and scientific Ideas, of which we have spoken. The mind\r\nanalyzes such Notions, reasons upon them, combines and connects\r\nthem; for it feels assured that intellectual things ought to be able\r\nto bear such handling. Even practical knowledge, we see clearly, is\r\nnot possible without the use of the reason; and the speculative\r\nreason is only the reason satisfying itself of its own consistency.\r\nThe speculative faculty cannot be controlled from acting. The mind\r\ncannot but claim a right to speculate concerning all its own acts\r\nand creations; yet, when it exercises this right upon its common\r\npractical notions, we find that it runs into barren abstractions and\r\never-recurring cycles of subtlety. Such Notions are like waters\r\nnaturally stagnant; however much we urge and agitate them, they only\r\nrevolve in stationary {50} whirlpools. But the mind is capable of\r\nacquiring scientific Ideas, which are better fitted to undergo\r\ndiscussion and impulsion. When our speculations are duly fed from\r\nthe springheads of Observation, and frequently drawn off into the\r\nregion of Applied Science, we may have a living stream of consistent\r\nand progressive knowledge. That science may be both real as to its\r\nimport, and logical as to its form, the examples of many existing\r\nsciences sufficiently prove.\r\n\r\n_School Philosophy_.--So long, however, as attempts are made to form\r\nsciences, without such a verification and realization of their\r\nfundamental ideas, there is, in the natural series of speculation,\r\nno self-correcting principle. A philosophy constructed on notions\r\nobscure, vague, and unsubstantial, and held in spite of the want of\r\ncorrespondence between its doctrines and the actual train of\r\nphysical events, may long subsist, and occupy men's minds. Such a\r\nphilosophy must depend for its permanence upon the pleasure which\r\nmen feel in tracing the operations of their own and other men's\r\nminds, and in reducing them to logical consistency and systematical\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the main subjects of attention are not external\r\nobjects, but speculations previously delivered; the object is not to\r\ninterpret nature, but man's mind. The opinions of the Masters are\r\nthe facts which the Disciples endeavor to reduce to unity, or to\r\nfollow into consequences. A series of speculators who pursue such a\r\ncourse, may properly be termed a _School_, and their philosophy a\r\n_School Philosophy_; whether their agreement in such a mode of\r\nseeking knowledge arise from personal communication and tradition,\r\nor be merely the result of a community of intellectual character and\r\npropensity. The two great periods of School Philosophy (it will be\r\nrecollected that we are here directing our attention mainly to\r\nphysical science) were that of the Greeks and that of the Middle\r\nAges;--the period of the first waking of science, and that of its\r\nmidday slumber.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said thus briefly and imperfectly, would require great\r\ndetail and much explanation, to give it its full significance and\r\nauthority. But it seemed proper to state so much in this place, in\r\norder to render more intelligible and more instructive, at the first\r\naspect, the view of the attempted or effected progress of science.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, a disadvantage inevitably attending an undertaking\r\nlike the present, that it must set out with statements so abstract;\r\nand must present them without their adequate development and proof.\r\nSuch an Introduction, both in its character and its scale of\r\nexecution, may be compared to the geographical sketch of a country,\r\nwith which {51} the historian of its fortunes often begins his\r\nnarration. So much of Metaphysics is as necessary to us as such a\r\nportion of Geography is to the Historian of an Empire; and what has\r\nhitherto been said, is intended as a slight outline of the Geography\r\nof that Intellectual World, of which we have here to study the\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\nThe name which we have given to this History--A HISTORY OF THE\r\nINDUCTIVE SCIENCES--has the fault of seeming to exclude from the\r\nrank of Inductive Sciences those which are not included in the\r\nHistory; as Ethnology and Glossology, Political Economy, Psychology.\r\nThis exclusion I by no means wish to imply; but I could find no\r\nother way of compendiously describing my subject, which was intended\r\nto comprehend those Sciences in which, by the observation of facts\r\nand the use of reason, systems of doctrine have been established\r\nwhich are universally received as truths among thoughtful men; and\r\nwhich may therefore be studied as examples of the manner in which\r\ntruth is to be discovered. Perhaps a more exact description of the\r\nwork would have been, _A History of the principal Sciences hitherto\r\nestablished by Induction_. I may add that I do not include in the\r\nphrase \"Inductive Sciences,\" the branches of Pure Mathematics\r\n(Geometry, Arithmetic, Algebra, and the like), because, as I have\r\nelsewhere stated (_Phil. Ind. Sc._, book ii. c. 1), these are not\r\n_Inductive_ but _Deductive_ Sciences. They do not infer true\r\ntheories from observed facts, and more general from more limited\r\nlaws: but they trace the conditions of all theory, the properties of\r\nspace and number; and deduce results from ideas without the aid of\r\nexperience. The History of these Sciences is briefly given in\r\nChapters 13 and 14 of the Second Book of the _Philosophy_ just\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n\r\nI may further add that the other work to which I refer, the\r\n_Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, is in a great measure\r\nhistorical, no less than the present _History_. That work contains\r\nthe history of the Sciences so far as it depends on _Ideas_; the\r\npresent work contains the history so far as it depends upon\r\n_Observation_. The two works resulted simultaneously from the same\r\nexamination of the principal writers on science in all ages, and may\r\nserve to supplement each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{53}}\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF THE\r\nGREEK SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY,\r\nWITH REFERENCE TO\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Τίς γὰρ ἀρχὰ δέξατο ναυτιλίας;\r\n  Τίς δὲ κίνδυνος κρατεροῖς ἀδάμαντος δῆσεν ἄλοις;\r\n  . . . . . .

What they saw excited them to\r\nmeditate, to conjecture, and to reason: they endeavored to account for\r\nnatural events, to trace their causes, to reduce them to their\r\nprinciples. This habit of mind, or, at least that modification of it\r\nwhich we have here to consider, seems to have been first unfolded\r\namong the Greeks. And during that obscure introductory interval which\r\nelapsed while the speculative tendencies of men were as yet hardly\r\ndisentangled from the practical, those who were most eminent in such\r\ninquiries were distinguished by the same term of praise which is\r\napplied to sagacity in matters of action, and were called _wise_\r\nmen--σοφοὶ. But when it came to be clearly felt by such persons that\r\ntheir endeavors were suggested by the love of knowledge, a motive\r\ndifferent from the motives which lead to the wisdom of active life, a\r\nname was adopted of a more appropriate, as well as of a more modest\r\nsignification, and they were termed _philosophers_, or lovers of\r\nwisdom. This appellation is said[7\\1] to have been first assumed by\r\nPythagoras. Yet he, in Herodotus, instead of having this title, is\r\ncalled a powerful _sophist_--Ἑλλήνων οὐ τῷ ἀσθενεστάτῳ σοφιστῇ\r\nΠυθαγόρῃ;[8\\1] the historian using this word, as it would seem,\r\nwithout intending to imply that misuse of reason which the term\r\nafterwards came to denote. The historians of literature {56} placed\r\nPythagoras at the origin of the Italic School, one of the two main\r\nlines of succession of the early Greek philosophers: but the other,\r\nthe Ionic School, which more peculiarly demands our attention, in\r\nconsequence of its character and subsequent progress, is deduced from\r\nThales, who preceded the age of _Philosophy_, and was one of the\r\n_sophi_, or \"wise men of Greece.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\1: Cic. Tusc. v. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\1: Herod. iv. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe Ionic School was succeeded in Greece by several others; and the\r\nsubjects which occupied the attention of these schools became very\r\nextensive. In fact, the first attempts were, to form systems which\r\nshould explain the laws and causes of the material universe; and to\r\nthese were soon added all the great questions which our moral\r\ncondition and faculties suggest. The physical philosophy of these\r\nschools is especially deserving of our study, as exhibiting the\r\ncharacter and fortunes of the most memorable attempt at universal\r\nknowledge which has ever been made. It is highly instructive to\r\ntrace the principles of this undertaking; for the course pursued was\r\ncertainly one of the most natural and tempting which can be\r\nimagined; the essay was made by a nation unequalled in fine mental\r\nendowments, at the period of its greatest activity and vigor; and\r\nyet it must be allowed (for, at least so far as physical science is\r\nconcerned, none will contest this), to have been entirely\r\nunsuccessful. We cannot consider otherwise than as an utter failure,\r\nan endeavor to discover the causes of things, of which the most\r\ncomplete results are the Aristotelian physical treatises; and which,\r\nafter reaching the point which these treatises mark, left the human\r\nmind to remain stationary, at any rate on all such subjects, for\r\nnearly two thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe early philosophers of Greece entered upon the work of physical\r\nspeculation in a manner which showed the vigor and confidence of the\r\nquestioning spirit, as yet untamed by labors and reverses. It was\r\nfor later ages to learn that man must acquire, slowly and patiently,\r\nletter by letter, the alphabet in which nature writes her answers to\r\nsuch inquiries. The first students wished to divine, at a single\r\nglance, the whole import of her book. They endeavored to discover\r\nthe origin and principle of the universe; according to Thales,\r\n_water_ was the origin of all things, according to Anaximenes,\r\n_air_; and Heraclitus considered _fire_ as the essential principle\r\nof the universe. It has been conjectured, with great plausibility,\r\nthat this tendency to give to their Philosophy the form of a\r\nCosmogony, was owing to the influence of the poetical Cosmogonies\r\nand Theogonies which had been produced and admired at a still\r\nearlier age. Indeed,  such wide and ambitious {57} doctrines as\r\nthose which have been mentioned, were better suited to the dim\r\nmagnificence of poetry, than to the purpose of a philosophy which\r\nwas to bear the sharp scrutiny of reason. When we speak of the\r\n_principles_ of things, the term, even now, is very ambiguous and\r\nindefinite in its import, but how much more was that the case in the\r\nfirst attempts to use such abstractions! The term which is commonly\r\nused in this sense (ἀρχὴ), signified at first _the beginning_; and\r\nin its early philosophical applications implied some obscure mixed\r\nreference to the mechanical, chemical, organic, and historical\r\ncauses of the visible state of things, besides the theological views\r\nwhich at this period were only just beginning to be separated from\r\nthe physical. Hence we are not to be surprised if the sources from\r\nwhich the opinions of this period appear to be derived are rather\r\nvague suggestions and casual analogies, than any reasons which will\r\nbear examination. Aristotle conjectures, with considerable\r\nprobability, that the doctrine of Thales, according to which water\r\nwas the universal element, resulted from the manifest importance of\r\nmoisture in the support of animal and vegetable life.[9\\1] But such\r\nprecarious analyses of these obscure and loose dogmas of early\r\nantiquity are of small consequence to our object.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\1: Metaph. i. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn more limited and more definite examples of inquiry concerning the\r\ncauses of natural appearances, and in the attempts made to satisfy\r\nmen's curiosity in such cases, we appear to discern a more genuine\r\nprelude to the true spirit of physical inquiry. One of the most\r\nremarkable instances of this kind is to be found in the speculations\r\nwhich Herodotus records, relative to the cause of the floods of the\r\nNile. \"Concerning the nature of this river,\" says the father of\r\nhistory,[10\\1] \"I was not able to learn any thing, either from the\r\npriests or from any one besides, though I questioned them very\r\npressingly. For the Nile is flooded for a hundred days, beginning\r\nwith the summer solstice; and after this time it diminishes, and is,\r\nduring the whole winter, very small. And on this head I was not able\r\nto obtain any thing satisfactory from any one of the Egyptians, when\r\nI asked what is the power by which the Nile is in its nature the\r\nreverse of other rivers.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\1: Herod. ii. 19.]\r\n\r\nWe may see, I think, in the historian's account, that the Grecian\r\nmind felt a craving to discover the reasons of things which other\r\nnations did not feel. The Egyptians, it appears, had no theory, and\r\nfelt no want of a theory. Not so the Greeks; they had their reasons\r\nto render, though they were not such as satisfied Herodotus. \"Some\r\n{58} of the Greeks,\" he says, \"who wish to be considered great\r\nphilosophers (Ἑλλήνων τινες ἐπισήμοι βουλόμενοι γενέσθαι σοφίην),\r\nhave propounded three ways of accounting for these floods. Two of\r\nthem,\" he adds, \"I do not think worthy of record, except just so far\r\nas to mention them.\" But as these are some of the earliest Greek\r\nessays in physical philosophy, it will be worth while, even at this\r\nday, to preserve the brief notice he has given of them, and his own\r\nreasonings upon the same subject.\r\n\r\n\"One of these opinions holds that the Etesian winds [which blew from\r\nthe north] are the cause of these floods, by preventing the Nile\r\nfrom flowing into the sea.\" Against this the historian reasons very\r\nsimply and sensibly. \"Very often when the Etesian winds do not blow,\r\nthe Nile is flooded nevertheless. And moreover, if the Etesian winds\r\nwere the cause, all other rivers, which have their course opposite\r\nto these winds, ought to undergo the same changes as the Nile; which\r\nthe rivers of Syria and Libya so circumstanced do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next opinion is still more unscientific (ἀνεπιστημονεστέρη),\r\nand is, in truth, marvellous for its folly. This holds that the\r\nocean flows all round the earth, and that the Nile comes out of the\r\nocean, and by that means produces its effects.\" \"Now,\" says the\r\nhistorian, \"the man who talks about this ocean-river, goes into the\r\nregion of fable, where it is not easy to demonstrate that he is\r\nwrong. I know of no such river. But I suppose that Homer and some of\r\nthe earlier poets invented this fiction and introduced it into their\r\npoetry.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to a third account, which to a modern reasoner\r\nwould appear not at all unphilosophical in itself, but which he,\r\nnevertheless, rejects in a manner no less decided than the others.\r\n\"The third opinion, though much the most plausible, is still more\r\nwrong than the others; for it asserts an impossibility, namely, that\r\nthe Nile proceeds from the melting of the snow. Now the Nile flows\r\nout of Libya, and through Ethiopia, which are very hot countries,\r\nand thus comes into Egypt, which is a colder region. How then can it\r\nproceed from snow?\" He then offers several other reasons \"to show,\"\r\nas he says, \"to any one capable of reasoning on such subjects (ἀνδρί\r\nγε λογίζεσθαι τοιούτων πέρι οἵῳ τε ἔοντι), that the assertion cannot\r\nbe true. The winds which blow from the southern regions are hot; the\r\ninhabitants are black; the swallows and kites (ἰκτῖνοι) stay in the\r\ncountry the whole year; the cranes fly the colds of Scythia, and\r\nseek their warm winter-quarters there; which would not be if it\r\nsnowed ever so little.\" He adds another reason, founded apparently\r\nupon {59} some limited empirical maxim of weather-wisdom taken from\r\nthe climate of Greece. \"Libya,\" he said, \"has neither rain nor ice,\r\nand therefore no snow; _for_, in five days after a fall of snow\r\nthere must be a fall of rain; so that if it snowed in those regions\r\nit must rain too.\" I need not observe that Herodotus was not aware\r\nof the difference between the climate of high mountains and plains\r\nin a torrid region; but it is impossible not to be struck both with\r\nthe activity and the coherency of thought displayed by the Greek\r\nmind in this primitive physical inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut I must not omit the hypothesis which Herodotus himself proposes,\r\nafter rejecting those which have been already given. It does not\r\nappear to me easy to catch his exact meaning, but the statement will\r\nstill be curious. \"If,\" he says, \"one who has condemned opinions\r\npreviously promulgated may put forward his own opinion concerning so\r\nobscure a matter, I will state why it seems to me that the Nile is\r\nflooded in summer.\" This opinion he propounds at first with an\r\noracular brevity, which it is difficult to suppose that he did not\r\nintend to be impressive. \"In winter the sun is carried by the seasons\r\naway from his former course, and goes to the upper parts of Libya. And\r\n_there, in short, is the whole account;_ for that region to which this\r\ndivinity (the sun) is nearest, must naturally be most scant of water,\r\nand the river-sources of that country must be dried up.\"\r\n\r\nBut the lively and garrulous Ionian immediately relaxes from this\r\napparent reserve. \"To explain the matter more at length,\" he\r\nproceeds, \"it is thus. The sun when he traverses the upper parts of\r\nLibya, does what he commonly does in summer;--he _draws_ the water\r\nto him (ἕλκει ἐπ' ἑωϋτὸν τὸ ὕδωρ), and having thus drawn it, he\r\npushes it to the upper regions (of the air probably), and then the\r\nwinds take it and disperse it till they dissolve in moisture. And\r\nthus the winds which blow from those countries, Libs and Notus, are\r\nthe most moist of all winds. Now when the winter relaxes and the sun\r\nreturns to the north, he still draws water from all the rivers, but\r\nthey are increased by showers and rain torrents so that they are in\r\nflood till the summer comes; and then, the rain falling and the sun\r\nstill drawing them, they become small. But the Nile, not being fed\r\nby rains, yet being drawn by the sun, is, alone of all rivers, much\r\nmore scanty in the winter than in the summer. For in summer it is\r\ndrawn like all other rivers, but in winter it alone has its supplies\r\nshut up. And in this way, I have been led to think the sun is the\r\ncause of the occurrence in question.\" We may remark that the\r\nhistorian here appears to {60} ascribe the inequality of the Nile at\r\ndifferent seasons to the influence of the sun upon its springs\r\nalone, the other cause of change, the rains being here excluded; and\r\nthat, on this supposition, the same relative effects would be\r\nproduced whether the sun increase the sources in winter by melting\r\nthe snows, or diminish them in summer by what he calls _drawing_\r\nthem upwards.\r\n\r\nThis specimen of the early efforts of the Greeks in physical\r\nspeculations, appears to me to speak strongly for the opinion that\r\ntheir philosophy on such subjects was the native growth of the Greek\r\nmind, and owed nothing to the supposed lore of Egypt and the East;\r\nan opinion which has been adopted with regard to the Greek\r\nPhilosophy in general by the most competent judges on a full survey\r\nof the evidence.[11\\1] Indeed, we have no evidence whatever that, at\r\nany period, the African or Asiatic nations (with the exception\r\nperhaps of the Indians) ever felt this importunate curiosity with\r\nregard to the definite application of the idea of cause and effect\r\nto visible phenomena; or drew so strong a line between a fabulous\r\nlegend and a reason rendered; or attempted to ascend to a natural\r\ncause by classing together phenomena of the same kind. We may be\r\nwell excused, therefore, for believing that they could not impart to\r\nthe Greeks what they themselves did not possess; and so far as our\r\nsurvey goes, physical philosophy has its origin, apparently\r\nspontaneous and independent, in the active and acute intellect of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\1: Thirlwall, _Hist. Gr._, ii. 130; and, as there quoted,\r\nRitter, _Geschichte der Philosophie_, i. 159-173.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Primitive Mistake in Greek Physical Philosophy._\r\n\r\nWE now proceed to examine with what success the Greeks followed the\r\ntrack into which they had thus struck. And here we are obliged to\r\nconfess that they very soon turned aside from the right road to\r\ntruth, and deviated into a vast field of error, in which they and\r\ntheir successors have wandered almost to the present time. It is not\r\nnecessary here to inquire why those faculties which appear to be\r\nbestowed upon us for the discovery of truth, were permitted by\r\nProvidence to fail so signally in answering that purpose; whether,\r\nlike the powers by which we seek our happiness, they involve a\r\nresponsibility on our part, and may be defeated by rejecting the\r\nguidance of a higher faculty; or whether these endowments, though\r\nthey did not {61} immediately lead man to profound physical\r\nknowledge, answered some nobler and better purpose in his\r\nconstitution and government. The fact undoubtedly was, that the\r\nphysical philosophy of the Greeks soon became trifling and\r\nworthless; and it is proper to point out, as precisely as we can, in\r\nwhat the fundamental mistake consisted.\r\n\r\nTo explain this, we may in the first place return for a moment to\r\nHerodotus's account of the cause of the floods of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably have observed a remarkable phrase used by\r\nHerodotus, in his own explanation of these inundations. He says that\r\nthe sun _draws_, or attracts, the water; a metaphorical term,\r\nobviously intended to denote some more general and abstract\r\nconception than that of the visible operation which the word\r\nprimarily signifies. This abstract notion of \"drawing\" is, in the\r\nhistorian, as we see, very vague and loose; it might, with equal\r\npropriety, be explained to mean what we now understand by mechanical\r\nor by chemical attraction, or pressure, or evaporation. And in like\r\nmanner, all the first attempts to comprehend the operations of\r\nnature, led to the introduction of abstract conceptions, often\r\nvague, indeed, but not, therefore, unmeaning; such as _motion_ and\r\n_velocity_, _force_ and _pressure_, _impetus_ and _momentum_ (ῥοπὴ).\r\nAnd the next step in philosophizing, necessarily was to endeavor to\r\nmake these vague abstractions more clear and fixed, so that the\r\nlogical faculty should be able to employ them securely and\r\ncoherently. But there were two ways of making this attempt; the one,\r\nby examining the words only, and the thoughts which they call up;\r\nthe other, by attending to the facts and things which bring these\r\nabstract terms into use. The latter, the method of _real_ inquiry,\r\nwas the way to success; but the Greeks followed the former, the\r\n_verbal_ or _notional_ course, and failed.\r\n\r\nIf Herodotus, when the notion of the sun's attracting the waters of\r\nrivers had entered into his mind, had gone on to instruct himself,\r\nby attention to facts, in what manner this notion could be made more\r\ndefinite, while it still remained applicable to all the knowledge\r\nwhich could be obtained, he would have made some progress towards a\r\ntrue solution of his problem. If, for instance, he had tried to\r\nascertain whether this Attraction which the sun exerted upon the\r\nwaters of rivers, depended on his influence at their fountains only,\r\nor was exerted over their whole course, and over waters which were\r\nnot parts of rivers, he would have been led to reject his\r\nhypothesis; for he would have found, by observations sufficiently\r\nobvious, that the sun's Attraction, as shown in such cases, is a\r\ntendency to lessen all expanded and {62} open collections of\r\nmoisture, whether flowing from a spring or not; and it would then be\r\nseen that this influence, operating on the whole surface of the\r\nNile, must diminish it as well as other rivers, in summer, and\r\ntherefore could not be the cause of its overflow. He would thus have\r\ncorrected his first loose conjecture by a real study of nature, and\r\nmight, in the course of his meditations, have been led to available\r\nnotions of Evaporation, or other natural actions. And, in like\r\nmanner, in other cases, the rude attempts at explanation, which the\r\nfirst exercise of the speculative faculty produced, might have been\r\ngradually concentrated and refined, so as to fall in, both with the\r\nrequisitions of reason and the testimony of sense.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the direction which the Greek speculators took. On\r\nthe contrary; as soon as they had introduced into their philosophy\r\nany abstract and general conceptions, they proceeded to scrutinize\r\nthese by the internal light of the mind alone, without any longer\r\nlooking abroad into the world of sense. They took for granted that\r\nphilosophy must result from the relations of those notions which are\r\ninvolved in the common use of language, and they proceeded to seek\r\ntheir philosophical doctrines by studying such notions. They ought\r\nto have reformed and fixed their usual conceptions by Observation;\r\nthey only analyzed and expanded them by Reflection: they ought to\r\nhave sought by trial, among the Notions which passed through their\r\nminds, some one which admitted of exact application to Facts; they\r\nselected arbitrarily, and, consequently, erroneously, the Notions\r\naccording to which Facts should be assembled and arranged: they\r\nought to have collected clear Fundamental Ideas from the world of\r\nthings by _inductive_ acts of thought; they only derived results by\r\n_Deduction_ from one or other of their familiar Conceptions.[12\\1]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\1: The course by which the Sciences were formed, and which\r\nis here referred to as that which the Greeks did _not_ follow, is\r\ndescribed in detail in the _Philosophy_, book xi., _Of the\r\nConstruction of Science_.]\r\n\r\nWhen this false direction had been extensively adopted by the Greek\r\nphilosophers, we may treat of it as the method of their _Schools_.\r\nUnder that title we must give a further account of it. {63}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_The general Foundation of the Greek School Philosophy._\r\n\r\nTHE physical philosophy of the Greek Schools was formed by looking\r\nat the material world through the medium of that common language\r\nwhich men employ to answer the common occasions of life; and by\r\nadopting, arbitrarily, as the grounds of comparison of facts, and of\r\ninference from them, notions more abstract and large than those with\r\nwhich men are practically familiar, but not less vague and obscure.\r\nSuch a philosophy, however much it might be systematized, by\r\nclassifying and analyzing the conceptions which it involves, could\r\nnot overcome the vices of its fundamental principle. But before\r\nspeaking of these defects, we must give some indications of its\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe propensity to seek for principles in the common usages of\r\nlanguage may be discerned at a very early period. Thus we have an\r\nexample of it in a saying which is reported of Thales, the founder\r\nof Greek philosophy.[13\\1] When he was asked, \"What is the\r\n_greatest_ thing?\" he replied, \"_Place_; for all other things are\r\n_in_ the world, but the world is _in_ it.\" In Aristotle we have the\r\nconsummation of this mode of speculation. The usual point from which\r\nhe starts in his inquiries is, that we say thus or thus in common\r\nlanguage. Thus, when he has to discuss the question, whether there\r\nbe, in any part of the universe, a Void, or space in which there is\r\nnothing, he inquires first in how many senses we say that one thing\r\nis _in_ another. He enumerates many of these;[14\\1] we say the part\r\nis in the whole, as the finger is _in_ the hand; again we say, the\r\nspecies is in the genus, as man is included _in_ animal; again, the\r\ngovernment of Greece is _in_ the king; and various other senses are\r\ndescribed or exemplified, but of all these _the most proper_ is when\r\nwe say a thing is _in_ a vessel, and generally, _in place_. He next\r\nexamines what _place_ is, and comes to this conclusion, that \"if\r\nabout a body there be another body including it, it is in place, and\r\nif not, not.\" A body _moves_ when it changes its place; but {64} he\r\nadds, that if water be in a vessel, the vessel being at rest, the\r\nparts of the water may still move, for they are included by each\r\nother; so that while the whole does not change its place, the parts\r\nmay change their places in a circular order. Proceeding then to the\r\nquestion of a _void_, he, as usual, examines the different senses in\r\nwhich the term is used, and adopts, as the most proper, _place\r\nwithout matter_; with no useful result, as we shall soon see.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\1: Plut. _Conv. Sept. Sap._ Diog. Laert. i. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\1: Physic. Ausc. iv. 3.]\r\n\r\nAgain,[15\\1] in a question concerning mechanical action, he says,\r\n\"When a man moves a stone by pushing it with a stick, _we say_ both\r\nthat the man moves the stone, and that the stick moves the stone,\r\nbut the latter _more properly_.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\1: Physic. Ausc. viii. 5.]\r\n\r\nAgain, we find the Greek philosophers applying themselves to extract\r\ntheir dogmas from the most general and abstract notions which they\r\ncould detect; for example,--from the conception of the Universe as\r\nOne or as Many things. They tried to determine how far we may, or\r\nmust, combine with these conceptions that of a whole, of parts, of\r\nnumber, of limits, of place, of beginning or end, of full or void,\r\nof rest or motion, of cause and effect, and the like. The analysis\r\nof such conceptions with such a view, occupies, for instance, almost\r\nthe whole of Aristotle's _Treatise on the Heavens_.\r\n\r\nThe Dialogue of Plato, which is entitled _Parmenides_, appears at\r\nfirst as if its object were to show the futility of this method of\r\nphilosophizing; for the philosopher whose name it bears, is\r\nrepresented as arguing with an Athenian named Aristotle,[16\\1] and,\r\nby a process of metaphysical analysis, reducing him at least to this\r\nconclusion, \"that whether _One_ exist, or do not exist, it follows\r\nthat both it and other things, with reference to themselves and to\r\neach other, all and in all respects, both are and are not, both\r\nappear and appear not.\" Yet the method of Plato, so far as concerns\r\ntruths of that kind with which we are here concerned, was little\r\nmore efficacious than that of his rival. It consists mainly, as may\r\nbe seen in several of the dialogues, and especially in the _Timæus_,\r\nin the application of notions as loose as those of the Peripatetics;\r\nfor example, the conceptions of the Good, the Beautiful, the\r\nPerfect; and these are rendered still more arbitrary, by assuming an\r\nacquaintance with the views of the Creator of the universe. The\r\nphilosopher is thus led to maxims which agree with those {65} of the\r\nAristotelians, that there can be no void, that things seek their own\r\nplace, and the like.[17\\1]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\1: This Aristotle is not the Stagirite, who was forty-five\r\nyears younger than Plato, but one of the \"thirty tyrants,\" as they\r\nwere called.]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\1: Timæus, p. 80.]\r\n\r\nAnother mode of reasoning, very widely applied in these attempts,\r\nwas the doctrine of contrarieties, in which it was assumed, that\r\nadjectives or substantives which are in common language, or in some\r\nabstract mode of conception, opposed to each other, must point at\r\nsome fundamental antithesis in nature, which it is important to\r\nstudy. Thus Aristotle[18\\1] says, that the Pythagoreans, from the\r\ncontrasts which number suggests, collected ten principles,--Limited\r\nand Unlimited, Odd and Even, One and Many, Right and Left, Male and\r\nFemale, Rest and Motion, Straight and Curved, Light and Darkness,\r\nGood and Evil, Square and Oblong. We shall see hereafter, that\r\nAristotle himself deduced the doctrine of Four Elements, and other\r\ndogmas, by oppositions of the same kind.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\1: Metaph. 1. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe physical speculator of the present day will learn without\r\nsurprise, that such a mode of discussion as this, led to no truths\r\nof real or permanent value. The whole mass of the Greek philosophy,\r\ntherefore, shrinks into an almost imperceptible compass, when viewed\r\nwith reference to the progress of physical knowledge. Still the\r\ngeneral character of this system, and its fortunes from the time of\r\nits founders to the overthrow of their authority, are not without\r\ntheir instruction, and, it may be hoped, not without their interest.\r\nI proceed, therefore, to give some account of these doctrines in\r\ntheir most fully developed and permanently received form, that in\r\nwhich they were presented by Aristotle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_The Aristotelian Physical Philosophy._\r\n\r\nTHE principal physical treatises of Aristotle are, the eight Books\r\nof \"Physical Lectures,\" the four Books \"Of the Heavens,\" the two\r\nBooks \"Of Production and Destruction:\" for the Book \"Of the World\"\r\nis now universally acknowledged to be spurious; and the\r\n\"Meteorologies,\" though full of physical explanations of natural\r\nphenomena, does not exhibit the doctrines and reasonings of the\r\nschool in so general a form; the same may be said of the \"Mechanical\r\nProblems.\" The treatises on the various subjects of Natural History,\r\n\"On Animals,\" \"On the Parts of Animals,\" \"On Plants,\" \"On\r\nPhysiognomonics,\" \"On Colors,\" \"On Sound,\" contain an extraordinary\r\n{66} accumulation of facts, and manifest a wonderful power of\r\nsystematizing; but are not works which expound principles, and\r\ntherefore do not require to be here considered.\r\n\r\nThe Physical Lectures are possibly the work concerning which a\r\nwell-known anecdote is related by Simplicius, a Greek commentator of\r\nthe sixth century, as well as by Plutarch. It is said, that\r\nAlexander the Great wrote to his former tutor to this effect; \"You\r\nhave not done well in publishing these lectures; for how shall we,\r\nyour pupils, excel other men, if you make that public to all, which\r\nwe learnt from you?\" To this Aristotle is said to have replied: \"My\r\nLectures are published and not published; they will be intelligible\r\nto those who heard them, and to none besides.\" This may very easily\r\nbe a story invented and circulated among those who found the work\r\nbeyond their comprehension; and it cannot be denied, that to make\r\nout the meaning and reasoning of every part, would be a task very\r\nlaborious and difficult, if not impossible. But we may follow the\r\nimport of a large portion of the Physical Lectures with sufficient\r\nclearness to apprehend the character and principles of the\r\nreasoning; and this is what I shall endeavor to do.\r\n\r\nThe author's introductory statement of his view of the nature of\r\nphilosophy falls in very closely with what has been said, that he\r\ntakes his facts and generalizations as they are implied in the\r\nstructure of language. \"We must in all cases proceed,\" he says,\r\n\"from what is known to what is unknown.\" This will not be denied;\r\nbut we can hardly follow him in his inference. He adds, \"We must\r\nproceed, therefore, from universal to particular. And something of\r\nthis,\" he pursues, \"may be seen in language; for names signify\r\nthings in a general and indefinite manner, as _circle_, and by\r\ndefining we unfold them into particulars.\" He illustrates this by\r\nsaying, \"thus children at first call all men _father_, and all women\r\n_mother_, but afterwards distinguish.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view, he endeavors to settle several of the\r\ngreat questions concerning the universe, which had been started\r\namong subtle and speculative men, by unfolding the meaning of the\r\nwords and phrases which are applied to the most general notions of\r\nthings and relations. We have already noticed this method. A few\r\nexamples will illustrate it further:--Whether there was or was not a\r\n_void_, or place without matter, had already been debated among\r\nrival sects of philosophers. The antagonist arguments were briefly\r\nthese:--There must be a void, because a body cannot move into a\r\nspace except it is {67} empty, and therefore without a void there\r\ncould be no motion:--and, on the other hand, there is no void, for\r\nthe intervals between bodies are filled with air, and air is\r\nsomething. These opinions had even been supported by reference to\r\nexperiment. On the one hand, Anaxagoras and his school had shown,\r\nthat air, when confined, resisted compression, by squeezing a blown\r\nbladder, and pressing down an inverted vessel in the water; on the\r\nother hand, it was alleged that a vessel full of fine ashes held as\r\nmuch water as if the ashes were not there, which could only be\r\nexplained by supposing void spaces among the ashes. Aristotle\r\ndecides that there is no void, on such arguments as this:[19\\1]--In\r\na void there could be no difference of up and down; for as in\r\nnothing there are no differences, so there are none in a privation\r\nor negation; but a void is merely a privation or negation of matter;\r\ntherefore, in a void, bodies could not move up and down, which it is\r\nin their nature to do. It is easily seen that such a mode of\r\nreasoning, elevates the familiar forms of language and the\r\nintellectual connections of terms, to a supremacy over facts; making\r\ntruth depend upon whether terms are or are not privative, and\r\nwhether we say that bodies fall _naturally_. In such a philosophy\r\nevery new result of observation would be compelled to conform to the\r\nusual combinations of phrases, as these had become associated by the\r\nmodes of apprehension previously familiar.\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\1: Physic. Ausc. iv. 7, p. 215.]\r\n\r\nIt is not intended here to intimate that the common modes of\r\napprehension, which are the basis of common language, are limited\r\nand casual. They imply, on the contrary, universal and necessary\r\nconditions of our perceptions and conceptions; thus all things are\r\nnecessarily apprehended as existing in Time and Space, and as\r\nconnected by relations of Cause and Effect; and so far as the\r\nAristotelian philosophy reasons from these assumptions, it has a\r\nreal foundation, though even in this case the conclusions are often\r\ninsecure. We have an example of this reasoning in the eighth\r\nBook,[20\\1] where he proves that there never was a time in which\r\nchange and motion did not exist; \"For if all things were at rest,\r\nthe first motion must have been produced by some change in some of\r\nthese things; that is, there must have been a change before the\r\nfirst change;\" and again, \"How can _before_ and _after_ apply when\r\ntime is not? or how can time be when motion is not? If,\" he adds,\r\n\"time is a numeration of motion, and if time be eternal, motion must\r\nbe eternal.\" But he sometimes {68} introduces principles of a more\r\narbitrary character; and besides the general relations of thought,\r\ntakes for granted the inventions of previous speculators; such, for\r\ninstance, as the then commonly received opinions concerning the\r\nframe of the world. From the assertion that motion is eternal,\r\nproved in the manner just stated, Aristotle proceeds by a curious\r\ntrain of reasoning, to identify this eternal motion with the diurnal\r\nmotion of the heavens. \"There must,\" he says, \"be something which is\r\nthe First Mover:\"[21\\1] this follows from the relation of causes and\r\neffects. Again, \"Motion must go on constantly, and, therefore, must\r\nbe either continuous or successive. Now what is continuous is more\r\nproperly said to take place _constantly_, than what is successive.\r\nAlso the continuous is better; but we always suppose that which is\r\nbetter to take place in nature, if it be possible. The motion of the\r\nFirst Mover will, therefore, be continuous, if such an eternal\r\nmotion be possible.\" We here see the vague judgment of _better_ and\r\n_worse_ introduced, as that of _natural_ and _unnatural_ was before,\r\ninto physical reasonings.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\1: Ib. viii. 1, p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\1: Physic. Ausc. viii. 6. p. 258.]\r\n\r\nI proceed with Aristotle's argument.[22\\1] \"We have now, therefore,\r\nto show that there may be an infinite single, continuous motion, and\r\nthat this is circular.\" This is, in fact, proved, as may readily be\r\nconceived, from the consideration that a body may go on perpetually\r\nrevolving uniformly in a circle. And thus we have a demonstration,\r\non the principles of this philosophy, that there is and must be a\r\nFirst Mover, revolving eternally with a uniform circular motion.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\1: Ib. viii. 8.]\r\n\r\nThough this kind of philosophy may appear too trifling to deserve\r\nbeing dwelt upon, it is important for our purpose so far as to\r\nexemplify it, that we may afterwards advance, confident that we have\r\ndone it no injustice.\r\n\r\nI will now pass from the doctrines relating to the motions of the\r\nheavens, to those which concern the material elements of the\r\nuniverse. And here it may be remarked that the tendency (of which we\r\nare here tracing the development) to extract speculative opinions\r\nfrom the relations of words, must be very natural to man; for the\r\nvery widely accepted doctrine of the Four Elements which appears to\r\nbe founded on the opposition of the adjectives _hot_ and _cold_,\r\n_wet_ and _dry_, is much older than Aristotle, and was probably one\r\nof the earliest of philosophical dogmas. The great master of this\r\nphilosophy, however, puts the opinion in a more systematic manner\r\nthan his predecessors. {69}\r\n\r\n\"We seek,\" he says,[23\\1] \"the principles of sensible things, that\r\nis, of tangible bodies. We must take, therefore, not all the\r\ncontrarieties of quality, but those only which have reference to the\r\ntouch. Thus black and white, sweet and bitter, do not differ as\r\ntangible qualities, and therefore must be rejected from our\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\1: De Gen. et Corrupt. ii. 2.]\r\n\r\n\"Now the contrarieties of quality which refer to the touch are\r\nthese: hot, cold; dry, wet; heavy, light; hard, soft; unctuous,\r\nmeagre; rough, smooth; dense, rare.\" He then proceeds to reject all\r\nbut the four first of these, for various reasons; heavy and light,\r\nbecause they are not active and passive qualities; the others,\r\nbecause they are combinations of the four first, which therefore he\r\ninfers to be the four elementary qualities.\r\n\r\n\"[24\\1] Now in four things there are six combinations of two; but the\r\ncombinations of two opposites, as hot and cold, must be rejected; we\r\nhave, therefore, four elementary combinations, which agree with the\r\nfour apparently elementary bodies. Fire is hot and dry; air is hot and\r\nwet (for steam is air); water is cold and wet, earth is cold and dry.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\1: Ib. iii. 8.]\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that this disposition to assume that some common\r\nelementary quality must exist in the cases in which we habitually\r\napply a common adjective, as it began before the reign of the\r\nAristotelian philosophy, so also survived its influence. Not to\r\nmention other cases, it would be difficult to free Bacon's\r\n_Inquisitio in naturam calidi_, \"Examination of the nature of heat,\"\r\nfrom the charge of confounding together very different classes of\r\nphenomena under the cover of the word _hot_.\r\n\r\nThe correction of these opinions concerning the elementary\r\ncomposition of bodies belongs to an advanced period in the history\r\nof physical knowledge, even after the revival of its progress. But\r\nthere are some of the Aristotelian doctrines which particularly\r\ndeserve our attention, from the prominent share they had in the very\r\nfirst beginnings of that revival; I mean the doctrines concerning\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThese are still founded upon the same mode of reasoning from\r\nadjectives; but in this case, the result follows, not only from the\r\nopposition of the words, but also from the distinction of their\r\nbeing _absolutely_ or _relatively_ true. \"Former writers,\" says\r\nAristotle, \"have considered heavy and light _relatively_ only,\r\ntaking cases, where both things have weight, but one is lighter than\r\nthe other; and they imagined that, in {70} this way, they defined\r\nwhat was _absolutely_ (ἁπλῶς) heavy and light.\" We now know that\r\nthings which rise by their lightness do so only because they are\r\npressed upwards by heavier surrounding bodies; and this assumption\r\nof absolute levity, which is evidently gratuitous, or rather merely\r\nnominal, entirely vitiated the whole of the succeeding reasoning.\r\nThe inference was, that fire must be absolutely light, since it\r\ntends to take its place above the other three elements; earth\r\nabsolutely heavy, since it tends to take its place below fire, air,\r\nand water. The philosopher argued also, with great acuteness, that\r\nair, which tends to take its place below fire and above water, must\r\ndo so _by its nature_, and not in virtue of any combination of heavy\r\nand light elements. \"For if air were composed of the parts which\r\ngive fire its levity, joined with other parts which produce gravity,\r\nwe might assume a quantity of air so large, that it should be\r\nlighter than a small quantity of fire, having more of the light\r\nparts.\" It thus follows that each of the four elements tends to its\r\nown place, fire being the highest, air the next, water the next, and\r\nearth the lowest.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this train of errors arises from fallacies which have a\r\nverbal origin;--from considering light as opposite to heavy; and\r\nfrom considering levity as a quality of a body, instead of regarding\r\nit as the effect of surrounding bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to notice that a difficulty which often\r\nembarrasses persons on their entrance upon physical\r\nspeculations,--the difficulty of conceiving that up and down are\r\ndifferent directions in different places,--had been completely got\r\nover by Aristotle and the Greek philosophers. They were steadily\r\nconvinced of the roundness of the earth, and saw that this truth led\r\nto the conclusion that all heavy bodies tend in converging\r\ndirections to the centre. And, they added, as the heavy tends to the\r\ncentre, the light tends to the exterior, \"for Exterior is opposite\r\nto Centre as heavy is to light.\"[25\\1]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\1: De Cœlo, iv. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of bodies downwards and upwards, their weight, their\r\nfall, their floating or sinking, were thus accounted for in a manner\r\nwhich, however unsound, satisfied the greater part of the\r\nspeculative world till the time of Galileo and Stevinus, though\r\nArchimedes in the mean time published the true theory of floating\r\nbodies, which is very different from that above stated. Other parts\r\nof the doctrines of motion were delivered by the Stagirite in the\r\nsame spirit and with the same success. The motion of a body which is\r\nthrown along the {71} ground diminishes and finally ceases; the\r\nmotion of a body which falls from a height goes on becoming quicker\r\nand quicker; this was accounted for on the usual principle of\r\nopposition, by saying that the former is a _violent_, the latter a\r\n_natural_ motion. And the later writers of this school expressed the\r\ncharacters of such motions in verse. The rule of natural motion\r\nwas[26\\1]\r\n  Principium tepeat, medium cum fine calebit.\r\n  Cool at the first, it warm and warmer glows.\r\nAnd of violent motion, the law was--\r\n  Principium fervet, medium calet, ultima friget.\r\n  Hot at the first, then barely warm, then cold.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\1: Alsted. Encyc. tom. i. p. 687.]\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been considered by Aristotle a difficult problem\r\nto explain why a stone thrown from the hand continues to move for\r\nsome time, and then stops. If the hand was the cause of the motion,\r\nhow could the stone move at all when left to itself? if not, why\r\ndoes it ever stop? And he answers this difficulty by saying,[27\\1]\r\n\"that there is a motion communicated to the air, the successive\r\nparts of which urge the stone onwards; and that each part of this\r\nmedium continues to act for some while after it has been acted on,\r\nand the motion ceases when it comes to a particle which cannot act\r\nafter it has ceased to be acted on.\" It will be readily seen that\r\nthe whole of this difficulty, concerning a body which moves forward\r\nand is retarded till it stops, arises from ascribing the\r\nretardation, not to the real cause, the surrounding resistances, but\r\nto the body itself.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\1: Phys. Ausc. viii. 10.]\r\n\r\nOne of the doctrines which was the subject of the warmest discussion\r\nbetween the defenders and opposers of Aristotle, at the revival of\r\nphysical knowledge, was that in which he asserts,[28\\1] \"That body\r\nis heavier than another which in an equal bulk moves downward\r\nquicker.\" The opinion maintained by the **Aristotelians at the time of\r\nGalileo was, that bodies fall quicker exactly in proportion to their\r\nweight. The master himself asserts this in express terms, and\r\nreasons upon it.[29\\1] Yet in another passage he appears to\r\ndistinguish between weight and actual motion downwards.[30\\1] \"In\r\nphysics, we call bodies heavy and light from their _power_ of\r\nmotion; but these names are not applied to their actual operations\r\n(ἐνέργειαις) except any one thinks {72} _momentum_ (ῥοπὴ) to be a\r\nword of both applications. But heavy and light are, as it were, the\r\n_embers_ or _sparks_ of motion, and therefore proper to be treated\r\nof here.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\1: De Cœlo, iv. 1, p. 308.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\1: Ib. iii. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\1: Ib. iv. 1, p. 307.]\r\n\r\nThe distinction just alluded to, between Power or Faculty of Action,\r\nand actual Operation or Energy, is one very frequently referred to\r\nby Aristotle; and though not by any means useless, may easily be so\r\nused as to lead to mere verbal refinements instead of substantial\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Aristotelian distinction of Causes has not any very immediate\r\nbearing upon the parts of physics of which we have here mainly\r\nspoken; but it was so extensively accepted, and so long retained,\r\nthat it may be proper to notice it.[31\\1] \"One kind of Cause is the\r\nmatter of which any thing is made, as bronze of a statue, and silver\r\nof a vial; another is the form and pattern, as the Cause of an\r\noctave is the ratio of two to one; again, there is the Cause which\r\nis the origin of the production, as the father of the child; and\r\nagain, there is the End, or that for the sake of which any thing is\r\ndone, as health is the cause of walking.\" These four kinds of Cause,\r\nthe _material_, the _formal_, the _efficient_, and the _final_, were\r\nlong leading points in all speculative inquiries; and our familiar\r\nforms of speech still retain traces of the influence of this\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\1: Phys. ii. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt is my object here to present to the reader in an intelligible\r\nshape, the principles and mode of reasoning of the Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy, not its results. If this were not the case, it would be\r\neasy to excite a smile by insulating some of the passages which are\r\nmost remote from modern notions. I will only mention, as specimens,\r\ntwo such passages, both very remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the book \"On the Heavens,\" he proves[32\\1] the\r\nworld to be _perfect_, by reasoning of the following kind: \"The\r\nbodies of which the world is composed are solids, and therefore have\r\nthree dimensions: now three is the most perfect number; it is the\r\nfirst of numbers, for of _one_ we do not speak as a number; of _two_\r\nwe say _both_; but _three_ is the first number of which we say\r\n_all_; moreover, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\1: De Cœlo, i. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will still perceive the verbal foundations of opinions\r\nthus supported.\r\n\r\n\"The simple elements must have simple motions, and thus fire and air\r\nhave their natural motions upwards, and water and earth have {73}\r\ntheir natural motions downwards; but besides these motions, there is\r\nmotion in a circle, which is unnatural to these elements, but which\r\nis a more perfect motion than the other, because a circle is a\r\nperfect line, and a straight line is not; and there must be\r\nsomething to which this motion is natural. From this it is evident,\"\r\nhe adds, with obvious animation, \"that there is some essence of body\r\ndifferent from those of the four elements, more divine than those,\r\nand superior to them. If things which move in a circle move contrary\r\nto nature, it is marvellous, or rather absurd, that this, the\r\nunnatural motion, should alone be continuous and eternal; for\r\nunnatural motions decay speedily. And so, from all this, we must\r\ncollect, that besides the four elements which we have here and about\r\nus, there is another removed far off, and the more excellent in\r\nproportion as it is more distant from us.\" This fifth element was\r\nthe \"_quinta essentia_,\" of after writers, of which we have a trace\r\nin our modern literature, in the word _quintessence_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Technical Forms of the Greek Schools._\r\n\r\nWE have hitherto considered only the principle of the Greek Physics;\r\nwhich was, as we have seen, to deduce its doctrines by an analysis\r\nof the notions which common language involves. But though the\r\nGrecian philosopher began by studying words in their common\r\nmeanings, he soon found himself led to fix upon some special shades\r\nor applications of these meanings as the permanent and standard\r\nnotion, which they were to express; that is, he made his language\r\n_technical_. The invention and establishment of technical terms is\r\nan important step in any philosophy, true or false; we must,\r\ntherefore, say a few words on this process, as exemplified in the\r\nancient systems.\r\n\r\n1. _Technical Forms of the Aristotelian Philosophy._--We have\r\nalready had occasion to cite some of the distinctions introduced by\r\nAristotle, which may be considered as technical; for instance, the\r\nclassification of Causes as _material_, _formal_, _efficient_, and\r\n_final_; and the opposition of Qualities as _absolute_ and\r\n_relative_. A few more of the most important examples may suffice.\r\nAn analysis of objects into _Matter_ and _Form_, when metaphorically\r\nextended from visible objects to things conceived in the most\r\ngeneral manner, became an habitual hypothesis of the Aristotelian\r\nschool. Indeed this metaphor is even yet one of the most significant\r\nof those which we can employ, to suggest one of the most comprehensive\r\nand fundamental antitheses with which philosophy has to do;--the\r\nopposition of sense and reason, of {74} impressions and laws. In this\r\napplication, the German philosophers have, up to the present time,\r\nrested upon this distinction a great part of the weight of their\r\nsystems; as when Kant says, that Space and Time are the _Forms of\r\nSensation_. Even in our own language, we retain a trace of the\r\ninfluence of this Aristotelian notion, in the word _Information_, when\r\nused for that knowledge which may be conceived as moulding the mind\r\ninto a definite shape, instead of leaving it a mere mass of\r\nunimpressed susceptibility.\r\n\r\nAnother favorite Aristotelian antithesis is that of _Power_ and\r\n_Act_ (δύναμις, ἐνέργεια). This distinction is made the basis of\r\nmost of the physical philosophy of the school; being, however,\r\ngenerally introduced with a peculiar limitation. Thus, Light is\r\ndefined to be \"the Act of what is lucid, as being lucid. And if,\" it\r\nis added, \"the lucid be so in power but not in act, we have\r\ndarkness.\" The reason of the limitation, \"as being lucid,\" is, that\r\na lucid body may act in other ways; thus a torch may move as well as\r\nshine, but its moving is not its act _as being a lucid_ body.\r\n\r\nAristotle appears to be well satisfied with this explanation, for he\r\ngoes on to say, \"Thus light is not Fire, nor any body whatever, or\r\nthe emanation of any body (for that would be a kind of body), but it\r\nis the presence of something like Fire in the body; it is, however,\r\nimpossible that two bodies should exist in the same place, so that\r\nit is not a body;\" and this reasoning appears to leave him more\r\nsatisfied with his doctrine, that Light is an _Energy_ or _Act_.\r\n\r\nBut we have a more distinctly technical form given to this notion.\r\nAristotle introduced a word formed by himself to express the act\r\nwhich is thus opposed to inactive power: this is the celebrated word\r\nἐντελέχεια. Thus the noted definition of Motion in the third book of\r\nthe Physics,[33\\1] is that it is \"the _Entelechy_, or Act, of a\r\nmovable body in respect of being movable;\" and the definition of the\r\nSoul is[34\\1] that it is \"the _Entelechy_ of a natural body which\r\nhas life by reason of its power.\" This word has been variously\r\ntranslated by the followers of Aristotle, and some of them have\r\ndeclared it untranslatable. _Act_ and _Action_ are held to be\r\ninadequate substitutes; the _very act_, _ipse cursus actionis_, is\r\nemployed by some; _primus actus_ is employed by many, but another\r\nschool use _primus actus_ of a non-operating form. Budæus uses\r\n_efficacia_. Cicero[35\\1] translates it \"quasi quandam continuatam\r\nmotionem, et perennem;\" but this paraphrase, though it may {75} fall\r\nin with the description of the soul, which is the subject with which\r\nCicero is concerned, does not appear to agree with the general\r\napplications of the term. Hermolaus Barbarus is said to have been so\r\nmuch oppressed with this difficulty of translation, that he\r\nconsulted the evil spirit by night, entreating to be supplied with a\r\nmore common and familiar substitute for this word: the mocking\r\nfiend, however, suggested only a word equally obscure, and the\r\ntranslator, discontented with this, invented for himself the word\r\n_perfectihabia_.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\1: Phys. iii. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\1: De Animâ, ii. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\1: Tusc. i. 10.]\r\n\r\nWe need not here notice the endless apparatus of technicalities\r\nwhich was, in later days, introduced into the Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy; but we may remark, that their long continuance and\r\nextensive use show us how powerful technical phraseology is, for the\r\nperpetuation either of truth or error. The Aristotelian terms, and\r\nthe metaphysical views which they tend to preserve, are not yet\r\nextinct among us. In a very recent age of our literature it was\r\nthought a worthy employment by some of the greatest writers of the\r\nday, to attempt to expel this system of technicalities by ridicule.\r\n\r\n\"Crambe regretted extremely that _substantial forms_, a race of\r\nharmless beings, which had lasted for many years, and afforded a\r\ncomfortable subsistence to many poor philosophers, should now be\r\nhunted down like so many wolves, without a possibility of retreat.\r\nHe considered that it had gone much harder with them than with\r\n_essences_, which had retired from the schools into the\r\napothecaries' shops, where some of them had been advanced to the\r\ndegree of _quintessences_.**\"[36\\1]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\1: Martinus Scriblerus, cap. vii.]\r\n\r\nWe must now say a few words on the technical terms which others of\r\nthe Greek philosophical sects introduced.\r\n\r\n2. _Technical Forms of the Platonists._--The other sects of the Greek\r\nphilosophy, as well as the Aristotelians, invented and adopted\r\ntechnical terms, and thus gave fixity to their tenets and consistency\r\nto their traditionary systems; of these I will mention a few.\r\n\r\nA technical expression of a contemporary school has acquired perhaps\r\ngreater celebrity than any of the terms of Aristotle. I mean the\r\n_Ideas_ of Plato. The account which Aristotle gives of the origin of\r\nthese will serve to explain their nature.[37\\1] \"Plato,\" says he,\r\n\"who, in his youth, was in habits of communication first with\r\nCratylus and the Heraclitean opinions, which represent all the\r\nobjects of sense as being in a perpetual flux, so that concerning\r\nthese no science nor certain {76} knowledge can exist, entertained\r\nthe same opinions at a later period also. When, afterwards, Socrates\r\ntreated of moral subjects, and gave no attention to physics, but, in\r\nthe subjects which he did discuss, arrived at universal truths, and\r\nbefore any man, turned his thoughts to definitions, Plato adopted\r\nsimilar doctrines on this subject also; and construed them in this\r\nway, that these truths and definitions must be applicable to\r\nsomething else, and not to sensible things: for it was impossible,\r\nhe conceived, that there should be a general common definition of\r\nany sensible object, since such were always in a state of change.\r\nThe things, then, which were the subjects of universal truths he\r\ncalled _Ideas_; and held that objects of sense had their names\r\naccording to Ideas and after them; so that things participated in\r\nthat Idea which had the same name as was applied to them.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\1: Arist. Metaph. i. 6. The same account is repeated, and\r\nthe subject discussed, Metaph. xii. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn agreement with this, we find the opinions suggested in the\r\n_Parmenides_ of Plato, the dialogue which is considered by many to\r\ncontain the most decided exposition of the doctrine of Ideas. In\r\nthis dialogue, Parmenides is made to say to Socrates, then a young\r\nman,[38\\1] \"O Socrates, philosophy has not yet claimed you for her\r\nown, as, in my judgment, she will claim you, and you will not\r\ndishonor her. As yet, like a young man as you are, you look to the\r\nopinions of men. But tell me this: it appears to you, as you say,\r\nthat there are certain _Kinds_ or _Ideas_ (εἰδὴ) of which things\r\npartake and receive applications according to that of which they\r\npartake: thus those things which partake of _Likeness_ are called\r\n_like_; those things which partake of _Greatness_ are called\r\n_great_; those things which partake of _Beauty_ and _Justice_ are\r\ncalled _beautiful_ and _just_.\" To this Socrates assents. And in\r\nanother part of the dialogue he shows that these Ideas are not\r\nincluded in our common knowledge, from whence he infers that they\r\nare objects of the Divine mind.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\1: Parmenid. p. 131.]\r\n\r\nIn the Phædo the same opinion is maintained, and is summed up in\r\nthis way, by a reporter of the last conversation of Socrates,[39\\1]\r\nεἶναι τι ἕκαστον τῶν εἰδῶν, καὶ τούτων τ' ἄλλα μεταλαμβάνοντα αὐτῶν\r\nτούτων τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ἴσχειν; \"that each _Kind_ has an existence, and\r\nthat other things partake of these Kinds, and are called according\r\nto the Kind of which they partake.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\1: Phædo, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nThe inference drawn from this view was, that in order to obtain true\r\nand certain knowledge, men must elevate themselves, as much as\r\npossible, to these Ideas of the qualities which they have to\r\nconsider: {77} and as things were thus called after the Ideas, the\r\nIdeas had a priority and pre-eminence assigned them. The _Idea_ of\r\nGood, Beautiful, and Wise was the \"First Good,\" the \"First\r\nBeautiful,\" the \"First Wise.\" This dignity and distinction were\r\nultimately carried to a large extent. Those Ideas were described as\r\neternal and self-subsisting, forming an \"Intelligible World,\" full\r\nof the models or archetypes of created things. But it is not to our\r\npurpose here to consider the Platonic Ideas in their theological\r\nbearings. In physics they were applied in the same form as in\r\nmorals. The _primum calidum_, _primum frigidum_ were those Ideas of\r\nfundamental Principles by participation of which, all things were\r\nhot or cold.\r\n\r\nThis school did not much employ itself in the development of its\r\nprinciples as applied to physical inquiries: but we are not without\r\nexamples of such speculations. Plutarch's Treatise Περὶ τοῦ Πρώτου\r\nΨυχροῦ, \"On the First Cold,\" may be cited as one. It is in reality a\r\ndiscussion of a question which has been agitated in modern times\r\nalso;--whether cold be a positive quality or a mere privation. \"Is\r\nthere, O Favorinus,\" he begins, \"a First Power and Essence of the\r\nCold, as Fire is of the Hot; by a certain presence and participation\r\nof which all other things are cold: or is rather coldness a\r\nprivation of heat, as darkness is of light, and rest of motion?\"\r\n\r\n3. _Technical Forms of the Pythagoreans._--The _Numbers_ of the\r\nPythagoreans, when propounded as the explanation of physical\r\nphenomena, as they were, are still more obscure than the Ideas of\r\nthe Platonists. There were, indeed, considerable resemblances in the\r\nway in which these two kinds of notions were spoken of. Plato called\r\nhis Ideas _unities_, _monads_; and as, according to him, Ideas, so,\r\naccording to the Pythagoreans, Numbers, were the causes of things\r\nbeing what they are.[40\\1] But there was this difference, that\r\nthings shared the nature of the Platonic Ideas \"by participation,\"\r\nwhile they shared the nature of Pythagorean Numbers \"by imitation.\"\r\nMoreover, the Pythagoreans followed their notion out into much\r\ngreater development than any other school, investing particular\r\nnumbers with extraordinary attributes, and applying them by very\r\nstrange and forced analogies. Thus the number Four, to which they\r\ngave the name of _Tetractys_, was held to be the most perfect\r\nnumber, and was conceived to correspond to the human soul, in some\r\nway which appears to be very imperfectly understood by the\r\ncommentators of this philosophy. {78}\r\n\r\n[Note: 40\\1: Arist. Metaph. i. 6.]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by a distinguished modern scholar,[41\\1] that\r\nthe place which Pythagoras ascribed to his numbers is intelligible\r\nonly by supposing that he confounded, first a numerical unit with a\r\ngeometrical point, and then this with a material atom. But this\r\ncriticism appears to place systems of physical philosophy under\r\nrequisitions too severe. If all the essential properties and\r\nattributes of things were fully represented by the relations of\r\nnumber, the philosophy which supplied such an explanation of the\r\nuniverse, might well be excused from explaining also that existence\r\nof objects which is distinct from the existence of all their\r\nqualities and properties. The Pythagorean love of numerical\r\nspeculations might have been combined with the doctrine of atoms,\r\nand the combination might have led to results well worth notice. But\r\nso far as we are aware, no such combination was attempted in the\r\nancient schools of philosophy; and perhaps we of the present day are\r\nonly just beginning to perceive, through the disclosures of\r\nchemistry and crystallography, the importance of such a line of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\1: Thirlwall's _Hist. Gr._ ii. 142.]\r\n\r\n4. _Technical Forms of the Atomists and Others._--The atomic\r\ndoctrine, of which we have just spoken, was one of the most definite\r\nof the physical doctrines of the ancients, and was applied with most\r\nperseverance and knowledge to the explanation of phenomena. Though,\r\ntherefore, it led to no success of any consequence in ancient times,\r\nit served to transmit, through a long series of ages, a habit of\r\nreally physical inquiry; and, on this account, has been thought\r\nworthy of an historical disquisition by Bacon.[42\\1]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\1: Parmenidis et Telesii et præcipue Democriti Philosophia,\r\n&c., Works, vol. ix. 317.]\r\n\r\nThe technical term, _Atom_, marks sufficiently the nature of the\r\nopinion. According to this theory, the world consists of a\r\ncollection of simple particles, of one kind of matter, and of\r\nindivisible smallness (as the name indicates), and by the various\r\nconfigurations and motions of these particles, all kinds of matter\r\nand all material phenomena are produced.\r\n\r\nTo this, the Atomic Doctrine of Leucippus and Democritus, was\r\nopposed the _Homoiomeria_ of Anaxagoras; that is, the opinion that\r\nmaterial things consist of particles which are homogeneous in each\r\nkind of body, but various in different kinds: thus for example,\r\nsince by food the flesh and blood and bones of man increase, the\r\nauthor of this doctrine held that there are in food particles of\r\nflesh, and blood, {79} and bone. As the former tenet points to the\r\ncorpuscular theories of modern times, so the latter may be\r\nconsidered as a dim glimpse of the idea of chemical analysis. The\r\nStoics also, who were, especially at a later period, inclined to\r\nmaterialist views, had their technical modes of speaking on such\r\nsubjects. They asserted that matter contained in itself tendencies\r\nor dispositions to certain forms, which dispositions they called\r\nλόγοι **σπερματικοὶ, _seminal proportions_, or _seminal reasons_.\r\n\r\nWhatever of sound view, or right direction, there might be in the\r\nnotions which suggested these and other technical expressions, was,\r\nin all the schools of philosophy (so far as physics was concerned)\r\nquenched and overlaid by the predominance of trifling and barren\r\nspeculations; and by the love of subtilizing and commenting upon the\r\nworks of earlier writers, instead of attempting to interpret the\r\nbook of nature. Hence these technical terms served to give fixity\r\nand permanence to the traditional dogmas of the sect, but led to no\r\nprogress of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe advances which were made in physical science proceeded, not from\r\nthese schools of philosophy (if we except, perhaps, the obligations\r\nof the science of Harmonics to the Pythagoreans), but from reasoners\r\nwho followed an independent path. The sequel of the ambitious hopes,\r\nthe vast schemes, the confident undertakings of the philosophers of\r\nancient Greece, was an entire failure in the physical knowledge of\r\nwhich it is our business to trace the history. Yet we are not, on\r\nthat account, to think slightingly of these early speculators. They\r\nwere men of extraordinary acuteness, invention, and range of\r\nthought; and, above all, they had the merit of first completely\r\nunfolding the speculative faculty--of starting in that keen and\r\nvigorous chase of knowledge out of which all the subsequent culture\r\nand improvement of man's intellectual stores have arisen. The sages\r\nof early Greece form the heroic age of science. Like the first\r\nnavigators in their own mythology, they boldly ventured their\r\nuntried bark in a distant and arduous voyage, urged on by the hopes\r\nof a supernatural success; and though they missed the imaginary\r\ngolden prize which they sought, they unlocked the gates of distant\r\nregions, and opened the seas to the keels of the thousands of\r\nadventurers who, in succeeding times, sailed to and fro, to the\r\nindefinite increase of the mental treasures of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut inasmuch as their attempts, in one sense, and at first, failed,\r\nwe must proceed to offer some account of this failure, and of its\r\nnature and causes. {80}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE GREEK SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Result of the Greek School Philosophy_.\r\n\r\nTHE methods and forms of philosophizing which we have described as\r\nemployed by the Greek Schools, failed altogether in their\r\napplication to physics. No discovery of general laws, no explanation\r\nof special phenomena, rewarded the acuteness and boldness of these\r\nearly students of nature. Astronomy, which made considerable\r\nprogress during the existence of the sects of Greek philosophers,\r\ngained perhaps something by the authority with which Plato taught\r\nthe supremacy and universality of mathematical rule and order; and\r\nthe truths of Harmonics, which had probably given rise to the\r\nPythagorean passion for numbers, were cultivated with much care by\r\nthat school. But after these first impulses, the sciences owed\r\nnothing to the philosophical sects; and the vast and complex\r\naccumulations and apparatus of the Stagirite do not appear to have\r\nled to any theoretical physical truths.\r\n\r\nThis assertion hardly requires proof, since in the existing body of\r\nscience there are no doctrines for which we are indebted to the\r\nAristotelian School. Real truths, when once established, remain to\r\nthe end of time a part of the mental treasure of man, and may be\r\ndiscerned through all the additions of later days. But we can point\r\nout no physical doctrine now received, of which we trace the\r\nanticipation in Aristotle, in the way in which we see the Copernican\r\nsystem anticipated by Aristarchus, the resolution of the heavenly\r\nappearances into circular motions suggested by Plato, and the\r\nnumerical relations of musical intervals ascribed to Pythagoras. But\r\nit may be worth while to look at this matter more closely.\r\n\r\nAmong the works of Aristotle are thirty-eight chapters of\r\n\"Problems,\" which may serve to exemplify the progress he had really\r\nmade in the reduction of phenomena to laws and causes. Of these\r\nProblems, a large proportion are physiological, and these I here\r\npass by, as not illustrative of the state of physical knowledge. But\r\nthose which are properly physical are, for the most part, questions\r\nconcerning such {81} facts and difficulties as it is the peculiar\r\nbusiness of theory to explain. Now it may be truly said, that in\r\nscarcely any one instance are the answers, which Aristotle gives to\r\nhis questions, of any value. For the most part, indeed, he propounds\r\nhis answer with a degree of hesitation or vacillation which of\r\nitself shows the absence of all scientific distinctness of thought;\r\nand the opinions so offered never appear to involve any settled or\r\ngeneral principle.\r\n\r\nWe may take, as examples of this, the problems of the simplest kind,\r\nwhere the principles lay nearest at hand--the mechanical ones.\r\n\"Why,\" he asks,[43\\1] \"do small forces move great weights by means\r\nof a lever, when they have thus to move the lever added to the\r\nweight? Is it,\" he suggests, \"because a greater radius moves\r\nfaster?\" \"Why does a small wedge split great weights?[44\\1] Is it\r\nbecause the wedge is composed of two opposite levers?\" \"Why,[45\\1]\r\nwhen a man rises from a chair, does he bend his leg and his body to\r\nacute angles with his thigh? Is it because a right angle is\r\nconnected with equality and rest?\" \"Why[46\\1] can a man throw a\r\nstone further with a sling than with his hand? Is it that when he\r\nthrows with his hand he moves the stone from rest, but when he uses\r\nthe sling he throws it already in motion?\" \"Why,[47\\1] if a circle\r\nbe thrown on the ground, does it first describe a straight line and\r\nthen a spiral, as it falls? Is it that the air first presses equally\r\non the two sides and supports it, and afterwards presses on one side\r\nmore?\" \"Why[48\\1] is it difficult to distinguish a musical note from\r\nthe octave above? Is it that proportion stands in the place of\r\nequality?\" It must be allowed that these are very vague and\r\nworthless surmises; for even if we were, as some commentators have\r\ndone, to interpret some of them so as to agree with sound\r\nphilosophy, we should still be unable to point out, in this author's\r\nworks, any clear or permanent apprehension of the general principles\r\nwhich such an interpretation implies.\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\1: Mech. Prob. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\1: Ib. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\1: Ib. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\1: Ib. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\1: Περὶ Ἄψυχα. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\1: Περὶ Ἁρμον. 14.]\r\n\r\nThus the Aristotelian physics cannot be considered as otherwise than\r\na complete failure. It collected no general laws from facts; and\r\nconsequently, when it tried to explain facts, it had no principles\r\nwhich were of any avail.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the physical speculations of the other\r\nschools of philosophy. They arrived at no doctrines from which they\r\ncould deduce, by sound reasoning, such facts as they saw; though\r\nthey {82} often venture so far to trust their principles as to infer\r\nfrom them propositions beyond the domain of sense. Thus, the\r\nprinciple that each element seeks _its own place_, led to the\r\ndoctrine that, the place of fire being the highest, there is, above\r\nthe air, a Sphere of Fire--of which doctrine the word _Empyrean_,\r\nused by our poets, still conveys a reminiscence. The Pythagorean\r\ntenet that ten is a perfect number,[49\\1] led some persons to assume\r\nthat the heavenly bodies are in number ten; and as nine only were\r\nknown to them, they asserted that there was an _antichthon_, or\r\n_counter-earth_, on the other side of the sun, invisible to us.\r\nTheir opinions respecting numerical ratios, led to various other\r\nspeculations concerning the distances and positions of the heavenly\r\nbodies: and as they had, in other cases, found a connection between\r\nproportions of distance and musical notes, they assumed, on this\r\nsuggestion, _the music of the spheres_.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\1: Arist. Metaph. i. 5.]\r\n\r\nAlthough we shall look in vain in the physical philosophy of the\r\nGreek Schools for any results more valuable than those just\r\nmentioned, we shall not be surprised to find, recollecting how much\r\nan admiration for classical antiquity has possessed the minds of\r\nmen, that some writers estimate their claims much more highly than\r\nthey are stated here. Among such writers we may notice Dutens, who,\r\nin 1766, published his \"Origin of the Discoveries attributed to the\r\nModerns; in which it is shown that our most celebrated Philosophers\r\nhave received the greatest part of their knowledge from the Works of\r\nthe Ancients.\" The thesis of this work is attempted to be proved, as\r\nwe might expect, by very large interpretations of the general\r\nphrases used by the ancients. Thus, when Timæus, in Plato's\r\ndialogue, says of the Creator of the world,[50\\1] \"that he infused\r\ninto it two powers, the origins of motions, both of that of the same\r\nthing and of that of different things;\" Dutens[51\\1] finds in this a\r\nclear indication of the projectile and attractive forces of modern\r\nscience. And in some of the common declamation of the Pythagoreans\r\nand Platonists concerning the general prevalence of numerical\r\nrelations in the universe, he discovers their acquaintance with the\r\nlaw of the inverse square of the distance by which gravitation is\r\nregulated, though he allows[52\\1] that it required all the\r\npenetration of Newton and his followers to detect this law in the\r\nscanty fragments by which it is transmitted.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\1: Tim. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\1: 3d ed. p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\1: Ib. p. 88.]\r\n\r\nArgument of this kind is palpably insufficient to cover the failure\r\nof the Greek attempts at a general physical philosophy; or rather we\r\n{83} may say, that such arguments, since they are as good as can be\r\nbrought in favor of such an opinion, show more clearly how entire\r\nthe failure was. I proceed now to endeavor to point out its causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Cause of the Failure of the Greek Physical Philosophy._\r\n\r\nTHE cause of the failure of so many of the attempts of the Greeks to\r\nconstruct physical science is so important, that we must endeavor to\r\nbring it into view here; though the full development of such\r\nsubjects belongs rather to the Philosophy of Induction. The subject\r\nmust, at present, be treated very briefly.\r\n\r\nI will first notice some errors which may naturally occur to the\r\nreader's mind, as possible causes of failure, but which, we shall be\r\nable to show, were not the real reasons in this case.\r\n\r\nThe cause of failure was _not the neglect of facts_. It is often\r\nsaid that the Greeks disregarded experience, and spun their\r\nphilosophy out of their own thoughts alone; and this is supposed by\r\nmany to be their essential error. It is, no doubt, true, that the\r\ndisregard of experience is a phrase which may be so interpreted as\r\nto express almost any defect of philosophical method; since\r\ncoincidence with experience is requisite to the truth of all theory.\r\nBut if we fix a more precise sense on our terms, I conceive it may\r\nbe shown that the Greek philosophy did, in its opinions, recognize\r\nthe necessity and paramount value of observations; did, in its\r\norigin, proceed upon observed facts; and did employ itself to no\r\nsmall extent in classifying and arranging phenomena. We must\r\nendeavor to illustrate these assertions, because it is important to\r\nshow that these steps alone do not necessarily lead to science.\r\n\r\n1. The acknowledgment of experience as the main ground of physical\r\nknowledge is so generally understood to be a distinguishing feature\r\nof later times, that it may excite surprise to find that Aristotle,\r\nand other ancient philosophers, not only asserted in the most\r\npointed manner that all our knowledge must begin from experience,\r\nbut also stated in language much resembling the habitual phraseology\r\nof the most modern schools of philosophizing, that particular facts\r\nmust be _collected_; that from these, general principles must be\r\nobtained by _induction_; and that these principles, when of the most\r\ngeneral kind, are _axioms_. A few passages will show this.\r\n\r\n\"The way[53\\1] must be the same,\" says Aristotle, in speaking of the\r\nrules of reasoning, \"with respect to philosophy, as it is with\r\nrespect to {84} any art or science whatever; we must collect the\r\nfacts, and the things to which the facts happen, in each subject,\r\nand provide as large a supply of these as possible.\" He then\r\nproceeds to say that \"we are not to look at once at all this\r\ncollected mass, but to consider small and definite portions\" . . .\r\n\"And thus it is the office of observation to supply principles in\r\neach subject; for instance, astronomical observation supplies the\r\nprinciples of astronomical science. For the phenomena being properly\r\nassumed, the astronomical demonstrations were from these discovered.\r\nAnd the same applies to every art and science. So that if we take\r\nthe facts (τὰ ὑπάρχοντα) belonging to each subject, it is _our_ task\r\nto mark out clearly the course of the demonstrations. For if _in our\r\nnatural history_ (κατὰ τὴν ἱστορίαν) we have omitted nothing of the\r\nfacts and properties which belong to the subject, we shall learn\r\nwhat we can demonstrate and what we cannot.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\1: Anal. Prior. i. 30.]\r\n\r\nThese facts, τὰ ὑπάρχοντα, he, at other times, includes in the term\r\n_sensation_. Thus, he says,[54\\1] \"It is obvious that if any\r\nsensation is wanting, there must be also some knowledge wanting\r\nwhich we are thus prevented from having, since we arrive at\r\nknowledge either by induction or by demonstration. Demonstration\r\nproceeds from universal propositions, Induction from particulars.\r\nBut we cannot have universal theoretical propositions except from\r\ninduction; and we cannot make inductions without having sensation;\r\nfor sensation has to do with particulars.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\1: Anal. Post. i. 18.]\r\n\r\nIn another place,[55\\1] after stating that principles must be prior\r\nto, and better known than conclusions, he distinguishes such\r\nprinciples into absolutely prior, and prior relative to us: \"The\r\nprior principles, relative to us, are those which are nearer to the\r\nsensation; but the principles absolutely prior are those which are\r\nmore remote from the sensation. The most general principles are the\r\nmore remote, the more particular are nearer. The general principles\r\nwhich are necessary to knowledge are _axioms_.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\1: Ib. i. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe may add to these passages, that in which he gives an account of\r\nthe way in which Leucippus was led to the doctrine of atoms. After\r\ndescribing the opinions of some earlier philosophers, he says,[56\\1]\r\n\"Thus, proceeding in violation of sensation, and disregarding it,\r\nbecause, as they held, they must follow reason, some came to the\r\nconclusion that the universe was one, and infinite, and at rest. As\r\nit appeared, however, that though this ought to be by reasoning, it\r\n{85} would go near to madness to hold such opinions in practice (for\r\nno one was ever so mad as to think fire and ice to be one),\r\nLeucippus, therefore, pursued a line of reasoning which was in\r\naccordance with sensation, and which was not irreconcilable with the\r\nproduction and decay, the motion and multitude of things.\" It is\r\nobvious that the school to which Leucippus belonged (the Eclectic)\r\nmust have been, at least in its origin, strongly impressed with the\r\nnecessity of bringing its theories into harmony with the observed\r\ncourse of nature.\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\1: De Gen. et Cor. i. 8.]\r\n\r\n2. Nor was this recognition of the fundamental value of experience a\r\nmere profession. The Greek philosophy did, in its beginning, proceed\r\nupon observation. Indeed it is obvious that the principles which it\r\nadopted were, in the first place, assumed in order to account for\r\nsome classes of facts, however imperfectly they might answer their\r\npurpose. The principle of things seeking their own places, was\r\ninvented in order to account for the falling and floating of bodies.\r\nAgain, Aristotle says, that heat is that which brings together\r\nthings of the same kind, cold is that which brings together things\r\nwhether of the same or of different kinds: it is plain that in this\r\ninstance he intended by his principle to explain some obvious facts,\r\nas the freezing of moist substances, and the separation of\r\nheterogeneous things by fusion; for, as he adds, if fire brings\r\ntogether things which are akin, it will separate those which are not\r\nakin. It would be easy to illustrate the remark further, but its\r\ntruth is evident from the nature of the case; for no principles\r\ncould be accepted for a moment, which were the result of an\r\narbitrary caprice of the mind, and which were not in some measure\r\nplausible, and apparently confirmed by facts.\r\n\r\nBut the works of Aristotle show, in another way, how unjust it would\r\nbe to accuse him of disregarding facts. Many large treatises of his\r\nconsist almost entirely of collections of facts, as for instance,\r\nthose \"On Colors,\" \"On Sounds,\" and the collection of Problems to\r\nwhich we have already referred; to say nothing of the numerous\r\ncollection of facts bearing on natural history and physiology, which\r\nform a great portion of his works, and are even now treasuries of\r\ninformation. A moment's reflection will convince us that the\r\nphysical sciences of our own times, for example. Mechanics and\r\nHydrostatics, are founded almost entirely upon facts with which the\r\nancients were as familiar as we are. The defect of their philosophy,\r\ntherefore, wherever it may lie, consists neither in the speculative\r\ndepreciation of the value of facts, nor in the practical neglect of\r\ntheir use.\r\n\r\n3. Nor again, should we hit upon the truth, if we were to say that\r\n{86} Aristotle, and other ancient philosophers, did indeed collect\r\nfacts; but that they took no steps in classifying and comparing\r\nthem; and that thus they failed to obtain from them any general\r\nknowledge. For, in reality, the treatises of Aristotle which we have\r\nmentioned, are as remarkable for the power of classifying and\r\nsystematizing which they exhibit, as for the industry shown in the\r\naccumulation. But it is not classification of facts merely which can\r\nlead us to knowledge, except we adopt that special arrangement,\r\nwhich, in each case, brings into view the principles of the subject.\r\nWe may easily show how unprofitable an arbitrary or random\r\nclassification is, however orderly and systematic it may be.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for a long period all unusual fiery appearances in the\r\nsky were classed together as _meteors_. Comets, shooting-stars, and\r\nglobes of fire, and the aurora borealis in all its forms, were thus\r\ngrouped together, and classifications of considerable extent and\r\nminuteness were proposed with reference to these objects. But this\r\nclassification was of a mixed and arbitrary kind. Figure, color,\r\nmotion, duration, were all combined as characters, and the\r\nimagination lent its aid, transforming these striking appearances\r\ninto fiery swords and spears, bears and dragons, armies and\r\nchariots. The facts so classified were, notwithstanding, worthless;\r\nand would not have been one jot the less so, had they and their\r\nclasses been ten times as numerous as they were. No rule or law that\r\nwould stand the test of observation was or could be thus discovered.\r\nSuch classifications have, therefore, long been neglected and\r\nforgotten. Even the ancient descriptions of these objects of\r\ncuriosity are unintelligible, or unworthy of trust, because the\r\nspectators had no steady conception of the usual order of such\r\nphenomena. For, however much we may fear to be misled by\r\npreconceived opinions, the caprices of imagination distort our\r\nimpressions far more than the anticipations of reason. In this case\r\nmen had, indeed we may say with regard to many of these meteors,\r\nthey still have, no science: not for want of facts, nor even for\r\nwant of classification of facts; but because the classification was\r\none in which no real principle was contained.\r\n\r\n4. Since, as we have said before, two things are requisite to\r\nscience,--Facts and Ideas; and since, as we have seen. Facts were\r\nnot wanting in the physical speculations of the ancients, we are\r\nnaturally led to ask, Were they then deficient in Ideas? Was there a\r\nwant among them of mental activity, and logical connection of\r\nthought? But it is so obvious that the answer to this inquiry must\r\nbe in the negative, that we need not dwell upon it. No one who knows\r\nany thing of the {87} history of the ancient Greek mind, can\r\nquestion, that in acuteness, in ingenuity, in the power of close and\r\ndistinct reasoning, they have never been surpassed. The common\r\nopinion, which considers the defect of their philosophical character\r\nto reside rather in the exclusive activity of such qualities, than\r\nin the absence of them, is at least so far just.\r\n\r\n5. We come back again, therefore, to the question, What was the\r\nradical and fatal defect in the physical speculations of the Greek\r\nphilosophical schools?\r\n\r\nTo this I answer: The defect was, that though they had in their\r\npossession Facts and Ideas, _the Ideas were not distinct and\r\nappropriate to the Facts_.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar characteristics of scientific ideas, which I have\r\nendeavored to express by speaking of them as _distinct_ and\r\n_appropriate to the facts_, must be more fully and formally set\r\nforth, when we come to the philosophy of the subject. In the mean\r\ntime, the reader will probably have no difficulty in conceiving\r\nthat, for each class of Facts, there is some special set of Ideas,\r\nby means of which the facts can be included in general scientific\r\ntruths; and that these Ideas, which may thus be termed\r\n_appropriate_, must be possessed with entire distinctness and\r\nclearness, in order that they may be successfully applied. It was\r\nthe want of Ideas having this reference to material phenomena, which\r\nrendered the ancient philosophers, with very few exceptions,\r\nhelpless and unsuccessful speculators on physical subjects.\r\n\r\nThis must be illustrated by one or two examples. One of the facts\r\nwhich Aristotle endeavors to explain is this; that when the sun's\r\nlight passes through a hole, whatever be the form of the hole, the\r\nbright image, if formed at any considerable distance from the hole,\r\nis round, instead of imitating the figure of the hole, as shadows\r\nresemble their objects in form. We shall easily perceive this\r\nappearance to be a necessary consequence of the circular figure of\r\nthe sun, if we conceive light to be diffused from the luminary by\r\nmeans of straight rays proceeding from every point of the sun's disk\r\nand passing through every point within the boundary of the hole. By\r\nattending to the consequences of this mode of conception, it will be\r\nseen that each point of the hole will be the vertex of a double cone\r\nof rays which has the sun's disk for its base on one side and an\r\nimage of the sun on the other; and the figure of the image of the\r\nhole will be determined by supposing a series of equal bright\r\ncircles, images of the sun, to be placed along the boundary of an\r\nimage equal to the hole itself. The figure of the image thus\r\ndetermined will partake of the form of the hole, and {88} of the\r\ncircular form of the sun's image: but these circular images become\r\nlarger and larger as they are further from the hole, while the\r\ncentral image of the hole remains always of the original size; and\r\nthus at a considerable distance from the hole, the trace of the\r\nhole's form is nearly obliterated, and the image is nearly a perfect\r\ncircle. Instead of this distinct conception of a cone of rays which\r\nhas the sun's disk for its basis, Aristotle has the following loose\r\nconjecture.[57\\1] \"Is it because light is emitted in a conical form;\r\nand of a cone, the base is a circle; so that on whatever the rays of\r\nthe sun fall, they appear more circular?\" And thus though he applies\r\nthe notion of rays to this problem, he possesses this notion so\r\n_indistinctly_ that his explanation is of no value. He does not\r\nintroduce into his explanation the consideration of the sun's\r\ncircular figure, and is thus prevented from giving a true account of\r\nthis very simple optical phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\1: Problem. 15, ὁσα μαθηματίκης, &c.]\r\n\r\n6. Again, to pass to a more extensive failure: why was it that\r\nAristotle, knowing the property of the lever, and many other\r\nmechanical truths, was unable to form them into a science of\r\nmechanics, as Archimedes afterwards did?\r\n\r\nThe reason was, that, instead of considering rest and motion\r\ndirectly, and distinctly, with reference to the Idea of Cause, that\r\nis Force, he wandered in search of reasons among other ideas and\r\nnotions, which could not be brought into steady connection with the\r\nfacts;--the ideas of properties of circles, of proportions of\r\nvelocities,--the notions of \"strange\" and \"common,\" of \"natural\" and\r\n\"unnatural.\" Thus, in the Proem to his Mechanical Problems, after\r\nstating some of the difficulties which he has to attack, he says,\r\n\"Of all such cases, the circle contains the principle of the cause.\r\nAnd this is what might be looked for; for it is nothing absurd, if\r\nsomething _wonderful_ is derived from something more wonderful\r\nstill. Now the most wonderful thing is, that opposites should be\r\ncombined; and the circle is constituted of such combinations of\r\nopposites. For it is constructed by a stationary point and a moving\r\nline, which are contrary to each other in nature; and hence we may\r\nthe less be surprised at the resulting contrarieties. And in the\r\nfirst place, the circumference of the circle, though a line without\r\nbreadth, has opposite qualities; for it is both _convex_ and\r\n_concave_. In the next place, it has, at the same time, opposite\r\nmotions, for it moves forward and backward at the same time. For the\r\ncircumference, setting out from any point, comes to the same point\r\nagain, so {89} that by a continuous progression, the last point\r\nbecomes the first. So that, as was before stated, it is not\r\nsurprising that the circle should be the principle of all wonderful\r\nproperties.\"\r\n\r\nAristotle afterwards proceeds to explain more specially how he\r\napplies the properties of the circle in this case. \"The reason,\" he\r\nsays, in his fourth Problem, \"why a force, acting at a greater\r\ndistance from the fulcrum, moves a weight more easily, is, that it\r\ndescribes a greater circle.\" He had already asserted that when a\r\nbody at the end of a lever is put in motion, it may be considered as\r\nhaving two motions; one in the direction of the tangent, and one in\r\nthe direction of the radius; the former motion is, he says,\r\n_according to nature_, the latter, _contrary to nature_. Now in the\r\nsmaller circle, the motion, contrary to nature, is more considerable\r\nthan it is in the larger circle. \"Therefore,\" he adds, \"the mover or\r\nweight at the larger arm will be transferred further by the same\r\nforce than the weight moved, which is at the extremity of the\r\nshorter arm.\"\r\n\r\nThese loose and inappropriate notions of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\"\r\nmotions, were unfit to lead to any scientific truths; and, with the\r\nhabits of thought which dictated these speculations a perception of\r\nthe true grounds of mechanical properties was impossible.\r\n\r\n7. Thus, in this instance, the error of Aristotle was the neglect of\r\nthe Idea _appropriate_ to the facts, namely, the Idea of Mechanical\r\nCause, which is Force; and the substitution of vague or inapplicable\r\nnotions involving only relations of space or emotions of wonder. The\r\nerrors of those who failed similarly in other instances, were of the\r\nsame kind. To detail or classify these would lead us too far into\r\nthe philosophy of science; since we should have to enumerate the\r\nIdeas which are appropriate, and the various classes of Facts on\r\nwhich the different sciences are founded,--a task not to be now\r\nlightly undertaken. But it will be perceived, without further\r\nexplanation, that it is necessary, in order to obtain from facts any\r\ngeneral truth, that we should apply to them that appropriate Idea,\r\nby which permanent and definite relations are established among them.\r\n\r\nIn such Ideas the ancients were very poor, and the stunted and\r\ndeformed growth of their physical science was the result of this\r\npenury. The Ideas of Space and Time, Number and Motion, they did\r\nindeed possess distinctly; and so far as these went, their science\r\nwas tolerably healthy. They also caught a glimpse of the Idea of a\r\nMedium by which the qualities of bodies, as colors and sounds, are\r\nperceived. But the idea of Substance remained barren in their hands;\r\n{90} in speculating about elements and qualities, they went the\r\nwrong way, assuming that the properties of Compounds must _resemble_\r\nthose of the Elements which determine them; and their loose notions\r\nof Contrariety never approached the form of those ideas of Polarity,\r\nwhich, in modern times, regulate many parts of physics and\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nIf this statement should seem to any one to be technical or\r\narbitrary, we must refer, for the justification of it, to the\r\nPhilosophy of Science, of which we hope hereafter to treat. But it\r\nwill appear, even from what has been here said, that there are\r\ncertain Ideas or Forms of mental apprehension, which may be applied\r\nto Facts in such a manner as to bring into view fundamental\r\nprinciples of science; while the same Facts, however arrayed or\r\nreasoned about, so long as these appropriate ideas are not employed,\r\ncannot give rise to any exact or substantial knowledge.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] This account of the cause of failure in the physical\r\nspeculations of the ancient Greek philosophers has been objected to\r\nas unsatisfactory. I will offer a few words in explanation of it.\r\n\r\nThe mode of accounting for the failure of the Greeks in physics is,\r\nin substance;--that the Greeks in their physical speculations fixed\r\ntheir attention upon the wrong aspects and relations of the\r\nphenomena; and that the aspects and relations in which phenomena are\r\nto be viewed in order to arrive at scientific truths may be arranged\r\nunder certain heads, which I have termed _Ideas_; such as Space,\r\nTime, Number, Cause, Likeness. In every case, there is an Idea to\r\nwhich the phenomena may be referred, so as to bring into view the\r\nLaws by which they are governed; this Idea I term the _appropriate_\r\nIdea in such case; and in order that the reference of the phenomena\r\nto the Law may be clearly seen, the Idea must be _distinctly_\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThus the reason of Aristotle's failure in his attempts at Mechanical\r\nScience is, that he did not refer the facts to the appropriate Idea,\r\nnamely Force, the Cause of Motion, but to relations of Space and the\r\nlike; that is, he introduces _Geometrical_ instead of _Mechanical_\r\nIdeas. It may be said that we learn little by being told that\r\nAristotle's failure in this and the like cases arose from his\r\nreferring to the wrong class of Ideas; or, as I have otherwise\r\nexpressed it, fixing his attention upon the wrong aspects and\r\nrelations of the facts; since, it may be said, this is only to state\r\nin other words that he _did_ fail. But this criticism is, I think,\r\nill-founded. The account which I have given is not only a statement\r\nthat Aristotle, and others who took a like course, did fail; but\r\nalso, that they failed in one certain point out of several {91}\r\nwhich are enumerated. They did not fail because they neglected to\r\nobserve facts; they did not fail because they omitted to class\r\nfacts; they did not fail because they had not ideas to reason from;\r\nbut they failed because they did not take the right ideas in each\r\ncase. And so long as they were in the wrong in this point, no\r\nindustry in collecting facts, or ingenuity in classing them and\r\nreasoning about them, could lead them to solid truth.\r\n\r\nNor is this account of the nature of their mistake without its\r\ninstruction for us; although we are not to expect to derive from the\r\nstudy of their failure any technical rule which shall necessarily\r\nguide us to scientific discovery. For their failure teaches us that,\r\nin the formation of science, an Error in the Ideas is as fatal to\r\nthe discovery of Truth as an Error in the Facts; and may as\r\ncompletely impede the progress of knowledge. I have in Books II. to\r\nX. of the _Philosophy_, shown historically how large a portion of\r\nthe progress of Science consists in the establishment of Appropriate\r\nIdeas as the basis of each science. Of the two main processes by\r\nwhich science is constructed, as stated in Book XI. of that work,\r\nnamely the _Explication of Conceptions_ and the _Colligation of\r\nFacts_, the former must precede the latter. In Book XII. chap. 5, of\r\nthe _Philosophy_, I have stated the maxim concerning appropriate\r\nIdeas in this form, that _the Idea and the Facts must be\r\nhomogeneous_.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the failure of the Greeks in physical science arose\r\nfrom their not employing _appropriate_ Ideas to connect the facts, I\r\ndo not use the term \"appropriate\" in a loose popular sense; but I\r\nemploy it as a somewhat technical term, to denote _the_ appropriate\r\nIdea, out of that series of Ideas which have been made (as I have\r\nshown in the _Philosophy_) the foundation of sciences; namely,\r\nSpace, Time, Number, Cause, Likeness, Substance, and the rest. It\r\nappears to me just to say that Aristotle's failure in his attempts\r\nto deal with problems of equilibrium, arose from his referring to\r\ncircles, velocities, notions of natural and unnatural, and the\r\nlike,--conceptions depending upon Ideas of Space, of Nature,\r\n&c.--which are not appropriate to these problems, and from his\r\nmissing the Idea of Mechanical Force or Pressure, which is the\r\nappropriate Idea.\r\n\r\nI give this, not as an account of _all_ failures in attempts at\r\nscience, but only as the account of such radical and fundamental\r\nfailures as this of Aristotle; who, with a knowledge of the facts,\r\nfailed to connect them into a really scientific view. If I had to\r\ncompare rival theories of a more complex kind, I should not\r\nnecessarily say that one involved {92} an appropriate Idea and the\r\nother did not, though I might judge one to be true and the other to\r\nbe false. For instance, in comparing the emissive and the undulatory\r\ntheory of light, we see that both involve the same Idea;--the Idea\r\nof a Medium acting by certain mechanical properties. The question\r\nthere is, What is the true view of the mechanism of the Medium?\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, however, that the example of Aristotle's failure\r\nin physics, given in p. 87, namely, his attempted explanation of the\r\nround image of a square hole, is a specimen rather of _indistinct_\r\nthan of inappropriate ideas.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical explanation of this phenomenon, which I have there\r\ninserted, was given by Maurolycus, and before him, by Leonardo da\r\nVinci.\r\n\r\nWe shall, in the next Book, see the influence of the appropriate\r\ngeneral Ideas, in the formation of various sciences. It need only be\r\nobserved, before we proceed, that, in order to do full justice to\r\nthe physical knowledge of the Greek Schools of philosophy, it is not\r\nnecessary to study their course after the time of their founders.\r\nTheir fortunes, in respect of such acquisitions as we are now\r\nconsidering, were not progressive. The later chiefs of the Schools\r\nfollowed the earlier masters; and though they varied much, they\r\nadded little. The Romans adopted the philosophy of their Greek\r\nsubjects; but they were always, and, indeed, acknowledged themselves\r\nto be, inferior to their teachers. They were as arbitrary and loose\r\nin their ideas as the Greeks, without possessing their invention,\r\nacuteness, and spirit of system.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vagueness which was combined with the more\r\nelevated trains of philosophical speculation among the Greeks, the\r\nRomans introduced into their treatises a kind of declamatory\r\nrhetoric, which arose probably from their forensic and political\r\nhabits, and which still further obscured the waning gleams of truth.\r\nYet we may also trace in the Roman philosophers to whom this charge\r\nmostly applies (Lucretius, Pliny, Seneca), the national vigor and\r\nambition. There is something Roman in the public spirit and\r\nanticipation of universal empire which they display, as citizens of\r\nthe intellectual republic. Though they speak sadly or slightingly of\r\nthe achievements of their own generation, they betray a more abiding\r\nand vivid belief in the dignity and destined advance of human\r\nknowledge as a whole, than is obvious among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, turn back, in order to describe steps of more\r\ndefinite value to the progress of science than those which we have\r\nhitherto noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{93}}\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF THE\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES\r\nIN\r\nANCIENT GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ναρθηκοπλήρωτον δὲ θηρῶμαι πυρὸς\r\n  Πηγὴν κλοπαίαν, ἣ διδάσκαλος τέχνης\r\n  Πάσης βροτοῖς πεφῆνε καὶ μέγας πόρος.\r\n          Prom.

They are thus led to propositions of a general character,\r\nwhich are obtained by Induction, as will elsewhere be more fully\r\nexplained. We proceed now to trace the formation of Sciences among\r\nthe Greeks by such processes. The provinces of knowledge which thus\r\ndemand our attention are, Astronomy, Mechanics and Hydrostatics,\r\nOptics and Harmonics; of which I must relate, first, the earliest\r\nstages, and next, the subsequent progress.\r\n\r\nOf these portions of human knowledge, Astronomy is, beyond doubt or\r\ncomparison, much the most ancient and the most remarkable; and\r\nprobably existed, in somewhat of a scientific form, in Chaldea and\r\nEgypt, and other countries, before the period of the intellectual\r\nactivity of the Greeks. But I will give a brief account of some of\r\nthe other Sciences before I proceed to Astronomy, for two reasons;\r\nfirst, because the origin of Astronomy is lost in the obscurity of a\r\nremote antiquity; and therefore we cannot exemplify the conditions\r\nof the first rise of science so well in that subject as we can in\r\nothers which assumed their scientific form at known periods; and\r\nnext, in order that I may not have to interrupt, after I have once\r\nbegun it, the history of the only progressive Science which the\r\nancient world produced.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the arrangement here employed that it is not\r\nsymmetrical; and that Astronomy, as being one of the Physical\r\nSciences, ought to have occupied a chapter in this Second Book,\r\ninstead of having a whole Book to itself (Book III). I do not pretend\r\nthat the arrangement is symmetrical, and have employed it only on the\r\nground of convenience. The importance and extent of the history of\r\nAstronomy are such that this science could not, with a view to our\r\npurposes, be made co-ordinate with Mechanics or Optics. {96}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST STAGES OF MECHANICS AND HYDROSTATICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Mechanics._\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY is a science so ancient that we can hardly ascend to a\r\nperiod when it did not exist; Mechanics, on the other hand, is a\r\nscience which did not begin to be till after the time of Aristotle;\r\nfor Archimedes must be looked upon as the author of the first sound\r\nknowledge on this subject. What is still more curious, and shows\r\nremarkably how little the continued progress of science follows\r\ninevitably from the nature of man, this department of knowledge,\r\nafter the right road had been fairly entered upon, remained\r\nabsolutely stationary for nearly two thousand years; no single step\r\nwas made, in addition to the propositions established by Archimedes,\r\ntill the time of Galileo and Stevinus. This extraordinary halt will\r\nbe a subject of attention hereafter; at present we must consider the\r\noriginal advance.\r\n\r\nThe great step made by Archimedes in Mechanics was the establishing,\r\nupon true grounds, the general proposition concerning a straight\r\nlever, loaded with two heavy bodies, and resting upon a fulcrum. The\r\nproposition is, that two bodies so circumstanced will balance each\r\nother, when the distance of the smaller body from the fulcrum is\r\ngreater than the distance of the other, in exactly the same\r\nproportion in which the weight of the body is less.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is proved by Archimedes in a work which is still\r\nextant, and the proof holds its place in our treatises to this day,\r\nas the simplest which can be given. The demonstration is made to\r\nrest on assumptions which amount in effect to such Definitions and\r\nAxioms as these: That those bodies are of equal weight which balance\r\neach other at equal arms of a straight lever; and that in every\r\nheavy body there is a definite point called a _Centre of Gravity_,\r\nin which point we may suppose the weight of the body collected.\r\n\r\nThe principle, which is really the foundation of the validity of the\r\ndemonstration thus given, and which is the condition of all\r\nexperimental knowledge on the subject, is this: that when two equal\r\nweights are supported on a lever, they act on the fulcrum of the lever\r\nwith the {97} same effect as if they were both together supported\r\nimmediately at that point. Or more generally, we may state the\r\nprinciple to be this: that the pressure by which a heavy body is\r\nsupported continues the same, however we alter the form or position of\r\nthe body, so long as the magnitude and material continue the same.\r\n\r\nThe experimental truth of this principle is a matter of obvious and\r\nuniversal experience. The weight of a basket of stones is not\r\naltered by shaking the stones into new positions. We cannot make the\r\ndirect burden of a stone less by altering its position in our hands;\r\nand if we try the effect on a balance or a machine of any kind, we\r\nshall see still more clearly and exactly that the altered position\r\nof one weight, or the altered arrangement of several, produces no\r\nchange in their effect, so long as their point of support remains\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nThis general fact is obvious, when we possess in our minds the ideas\r\nwhich are requisite to apprehend it clearly. But when we are so\r\nprepared, the truth appears to be manifest, even independent of\r\nexperience, and is seen to be a rule to which experience must\r\nconform. What, then, is the leading idea which thus enables us to\r\nreason effectively upon mechanical subjects? By attention to the\r\ncourse of such reasonings, we perceive that it is the idea of\r\n_Pressure_; Pressure being conceived as a measurable effect of heavy\r\nbodies at rest, distinguishable from all other effects, such as\r\nmotion, change of figure, and the like. It is not here necessary to\r\nattempt to trace the history of this idea in our minds; but it is\r\ncertain that such an idea may be distinctly formed, and that upon it\r\nthe whole science of statics may be built. _Pressure_, _load_,\r\n_weight_, are names by which this idea is denoted when the effect\r\ntends directly downwards; but we may have pressure without motion,\r\nor _dead pull_, in other cases, as at the critical instant when two\r\nnicely-matched wrestlers are balanced by the exertion of the utmost\r\nstrength of each.\r\n\r\nPressure in any direction may thus exist without any motion\r\nwhatever. But the causes which produce such pressure are capable of\r\nproducing motion, and are generally seen producing motion, as in the\r\nabove instance of the wrestlers, or in a pair of scales employed in\r\nweighing; and thus men come to consider pressure as the exception,\r\nand motion as the rule: or perhaps they image to themselves the\r\nmotion which _might_ or _would_ take place; for instance, the motion\r\nwhich the arms of a lever _would_ have if they _did_ move. They turn\r\naway from the case really before them, which is that of bodies at\r\nrest, and balancing each other, and pass to another case, which is\r\narbitrarily {98} assumed to represent the first. Now this arbitrary\r\nand capricious evasion of the question we consider as opposed to the\r\nintroduction of the distinct and proper idea of Pressure, by means\r\nof which the true principles of this subject can be apprehended.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Aristotle was in the number of those who\r\nthus evaded the difficulties of the problem of the lever, and\r\nconsequently lost the reward of success. He failed, as has before\r\nbeen stated, in consequence of his seeking his principles in\r\nnotions, either vague and loose, as the distinction of natural and\r\nunnatural motions, or else inappropriate, as the circle which the\r\nweight _would_ describe, the velocity which it _would_ have if it\r\nmoved; circumstances which are not part of the fact under\r\nconsideration. The influence of such modes of speculation was the\r\nmain hindrance to the prosecution of the true Archimedean form of\r\nthe science of Mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical doctrine of Equilibrium, is _Statics_. It is to be\r\ndistinguished from the mechanical doctrine of Motion, which is\r\ntermed _Dynamics_, and which was not successfully treated till the\r\ntime of Galileo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Hydrostatics._\r\n\r\nARCHIMEDES not only laid the foundations of the Statics of solid\r\nbodies, but also solved the principal problem of _Hydrostatics_, or\r\nthe Statics of Fluids; namely, the conditions of the floating of\r\nbodies. This is the more remarkable, since not only did the\r\nprinciples which Archimedes established on this subject remain\r\nunpursued till the revival of science in modern times, but, when\r\nthey were again put forward, the main proposition was so far from\r\nobvious that it was termed, and is to this day called, the\r\n_hydrostatic paradox_. The true doctrine of Hydrostatics, however,\r\nassuming the Idea of Pressure, which it involves, in common with the\r\nMechanics of solid bodies, requires also a distinct Idea of a Fluid,\r\nas a body of which the parts are perfectly movable among each other\r\nby the slightest partial pressure, and in which all pressure exerted\r\non one part is transferred to all other parts. From this idea of\r\nFluidity, necessarily follows that multiplication of pressure which\r\nconstitutes the hydrostatic paradox; and the notion being seen to be\r\nverified in nature, the consequences were also realized as facts.\r\nThis notion of Fluidity is expressed in the postulate which stands\r\nat the head of Archimedes' \"Treatise on Floating Bodies.\" And from\r\nthis principle are deduced the solutions, not only of the simple\r\nproblems of the science, but of some problems of considerable\r\ncomplexity. {99}\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of holding fast this Idea of Fluidity so as to trace\r\nits consequences with infallible strictness of demonstration, may be\r\njudged of from the circumstance that, even at the present day, men\r\nof great talents, not unfamiliar with the subject, sometimes admit\r\ninto their reasonings an oversight or fallacy with regard to this\r\nvery point. The importance of the Idea when clearly apprehended and\r\nsecurely held, may be judged of from this, that the whole science of\r\nHydrostatics in its most modern form is only the development of the\r\nIdea. And what kind of attempts at science would be made by persons\r\ndestitute of this Idea, we may see in the speculations of Aristotle\r\nconcerning light and heavy bodies, which we have already quoted;\r\nwhere, by considering light and heavy as opposite qualities,\r\nresiding in things themselves, and by an inability to apprehend the\r\neffect of surrounding fluids in supporting bodies, the subject was\r\nmade a mass of false or frivolous assertions, which the utmost\r\ningenuity could not reconcile with facts, and could still less\r\ndeduce from the asserted doctrines any new practical truths.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Statics and Hydrostatics, the most important\r\ncondition of their advance was undoubtedly the distinct apprehension\r\nof these two _appropriate Ideas_--_Statical Pressure_, and\r\n_Hydrostatical Pressure_ as included in the idea of Fluidity. For\r\nthe Ideas being once clearly possessed, the experimental laws which\r\nthey served to express (that the whole pressure of a body downwards\r\nwas always the same; and that water, and the like, were fluids\r\naccording to the above idea of fluidity), were so obvious, that\r\nthere was no doubt nor difficulty about them. These two ideas lie at\r\nthe root of all mechanical science; and the firm possession of them\r\nis, to this day, the first requisite for a student of the subject.\r\nAfter being clearly awakened in the mind of Archimedes, these ideas\r\nslept for many centuries, till they were again called up in Galileo,\r\nand more remarkably in Stevinus. This time, they were not destined\r\nagain to slumber; and the results of their activity have been the\r\nformation of two Sciences, which are as certain and severe in their\r\ndemonstrations as geometry itself and as copious and interesting in\r\ntheir conclusions; but which, besides this recommendation, possess\r\none of a different order,--that they exhibit the exact impress of\r\nthe laws of the physical world, and unfold a portion of the rules\r\naccording to which the phenomena of nature take place, and must take\r\nplace, till nature herself shall alter. {100}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST STAGES OF OPTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE progress made by the ancients in Optics was nearly proportional\r\nto that which they made in Statics. As they discovered the true\r\ngrounds of the doctrine of Equilibrium, without obtaining any sound\r\nprinciples concerning Motion, so they discovered the law of the\r\nReflection of light, but had none but the most indistinct notions\r\nconcerning Refraction.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the principles which they really possessed is easily\r\nstated. They knew that vision is performed by _rays_ which proceed\r\nin straight lines, and that these rays are _reflected_ by certain\r\nsurfaces (mirrors) in such manner that the angles which they make\r\nwith the surface on each side are equal. They drew various\r\nconclusions from these premises by the aid of geometry; as, for\r\ninstance, the convergence of rays which fall on a concave speculum.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the _Idea_ which is here introduced, is that\r\nof visual _rays_, or lines along which vision is produced and light\r\ncarried. This idea once clearly apprehended, it was not difficult to\r\nshow that these lines are straight lines, both in the case of light\r\nand of sight. In the beginning of Euclid's \"Treatise on Optics,\" some\r\nof the arguments are mentioned by which this was established. We are\r\ntold in the Proem, \"In explaining what concerns the sight, he adduced\r\ncertain arguments from which he inferred that all light is carried in\r\nstraight lines. The greatest proof of this is shadows, and the bright\r\nspots which are produced by light coming through windows and cracks,\r\nand which could not be, except the rays of the sun were carried in\r\nstraight lines. So in fires, the shadows are greater than the bodies\r\nif the fire be small, but less than the bodies if the fire be\r\ngreater.\" A clear comprehension of the principle would lead to the\r\nperception of innumerable proofs of its truth on every side.\r\n\r\nThe Law of Equality of Angles of Incidence and Reflection was not\r\nquite so easy to verify; but the exact resemblance of the object and\r\nits image in a plane mirror, (as the surface of still water, for\r\ninstance), which is a consequence of this law, would afford\r\nconvincing evidence of its truth in that case, and would be\r\nconfirmed by the examination of other cases. {101}\r\n\r\nWith these true principles was mixed much error and indistinctness,\r\neven in the best writers. Euclid, and the Platonists, maintained\r\nthat vision is exercised by rays proceeding _from_ the eye, not _to_\r\nit; so that when we see objects, we learn their form as a blind man\r\nwould do, by feeling it out with his staff. This mistake, however,\r\nthough Montucla speaks severely of it, was neither very\r\ndiscreditable nor very injurious; for the mathematical conclusions\r\non each supposition are necessarily the same. Another curious and\r\nfalse assumption is, that those visual rays are not close together,\r\nbut separated by intervals, like the fingers when the hand is\r\nspread. The motive for this invention was the wish to account for\r\nthe fact, that in looking for a small object, as a needle, we often\r\ncannot see it when it is under our nose; which it was conceived\r\nwould be impossible if the visual rays reached to all points of the\r\nsurface before us.\r\n\r\nThese errors would not have prevented the progress of the science.\r\nBut the Aristotelian physics, as usual, contained speculations more\r\nessentially faulty. Aristotle's views led him to try to describe the\r\nkind of causation by which vision is produced, instead of the laws\r\nby which it is exercised; and the attempt consisted, as in other\r\nsubjects, of indistinct principles, and ill-combined facts.\r\nAccording to him, vision must be produced by a Medium,--by something\r\n_between_ the object and the eye,--for if we press the object on the\r\neye, we do not see it; this Medium is Light, or \"the transparent in\r\naction;\" darkness occurs when the transparency is potential, not\r\nactual; color is not the \"absolute visible,\" but something which is\r\n_on_ the absolute visible; color has the power of setting the\r\ntransparent in action; it is not, however, all colors that are seen\r\nby means of light, but only the proper color of each object; for\r\nsome things, as the heads, and scales, and eyes of fish, are seen in\r\nthe dark; but they are not seen with their proper color.**[1\\2]\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\2: De Anim. ii. **7.]\r\n\r\nIn all this there is no steady adherence either to one notion, or to\r\none class of facts. The distinction of Power and Act is introduced\r\nto modify the Idea of Transparency, according to the formula of the\r\nschool; then Color is made to be something unknown in addition to\r\nVisibility; and the distinction of \"proper\" and \"improper\" colors is\r\nassumed, as sufficient to account for a phenomenon. Such\r\nclassifications have in them nothing of which the mind can take\r\nsteady hold; nor is it difficult to see that they do not come under\r\nthose {102} conditions of successful physical speculation, which we\r\nhave laid down.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to notice more distinctly the nature of the Geometrical\r\nPropositions contained in Euclid's work. The _Optica_ contains\r\nPropositions concerning Vision and Shadows, derived from the\r\nprinciple that the rays of light are rectilinear: for instance, the\r\nProposition that the shadow is greater than the object, if the\r\nilluminating body be less and _vice versa_. The _Catoptrica_\r\ncontains Propositions concerning the effects of Reflection, derived\r\nfrom the principle that the Angles of Incidence and Reflection are\r\nequal: as, that in a convex mirror the object appears convex, and\r\nsmaller than the object. We see here an example of the promptitude\r\nof the Greeks in deduction. When they had once obtained a knowledge\r\nof a principle, they followed it to its mathematical consequences\r\nwith great acuteness. The subject of concave mirrors is pursued\r\nfurther in Ptolemy's _Optics_.\r\n\r\nThe Greek writers also cultivated the subject of _Perspective_\r\nspeculatively, in mathematical treatises, as well as practically, in\r\npictures. The whole of this theory is a consequence of the principle\r\nthat vision takes place in straight lines drawn from the object to\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\n\"The ancients were in some measure acquainted with the Refraction as\r\nwell as the Reflection of Light,\" as I have shown in Book IX. Chap.\r\n2 [2d Ed.] of the _Philosophy_. The current knowledge on this\r\nsubject must have been very slight and confused; for it does not\r\nappear to have enabled them to account for one of the simplest\r\nresults of Refraction, the magnifying effect of convex transparent\r\nbodies. I have noticed in the passage just referred to, Seneca's\r\ncrude notions on this subject; and in like manner Ptolemy in his\r\n_Optics_ asserts that an object placed in water must always appear\r\nlarger then when taken out. Aristotle uses the term ἀνακλάσις\r\n(_Meteorol_. iii. 2), but apparently in a very vague manner. It is\r\nnot evident that he distinguished Refraction from Reflection. His\r\nCommentators however do distinguish these as διακλάσις and\r\nἀνακλάσις. See Olympiodorus in Schneider's _Eclogæ Physicæ_, vol. i.\r\np. 397. And Refraction had been the subject of special attention\r\namong the Greek Mathematicians. Archimedes had noticed (as we learn\r\nfrom the same writer) that in certain cases, a ring which cannot be\r\nseen over the edge of the empty vessel in which it is placed,\r\nbecomes visible when the vessel is filled with water. The same fact\r\nis stated in the _Optics_ of Euclid. We do not find this fact\r\nexplained in that work as we now have it; but in Ptolemy's _Optics_\r\nthe fact is explained by a flexure of the visual ray: it is {103}\r\nnoticed that this flexure is different at different angles from the\r\nperpendicular, and there is an elaborate collection of measures of\r\nthe flexure at different angles, made by means of an instrument\r\ndevised for the purpose. There is also a collection of similar\r\nmeasures of the refraction when the ray passes from air to glass,\r\nand when it passes from glass to water. This part of Ptolemy's work\r\nis, I think, the oldest extant example of a collection of\r\nexperimental measures in any other subject than astronomy; and in\r\nastronomy our measures are the result of _observation_ rather than\r\nof _experiment_. As Delambre says (_Astron. Anc._ vol. ii. p. 427),\r\n\"On y voit des expériences de physique bien faites, ce qui est sans\r\nexemple chez les anciens.\"\r\n\r\nPtolemy's Optical work was known only by Roger Bacon's references to\r\nit (_Opus Majus_, p. 286, &c.) till 1816; but copies of Latin\r\ntranslations of it were known to exist in the Royal Library at Paris,\r\nand in the Bodleian at Oxford. Delambre has given an account of the\r\ncontents of the Paris copy in his _Astron. Anc._ ii. 414, and in the\r\n_Connoissance des Temps_ for 1816; and Prof. Rigaud's account of the\r\nOxford copy is given in the article _Optics_, in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_. Ptolemy shows great sagacity in applying the notion of\r\nRefraction to the explanation of the displacement of astronomical\r\nobjects which is produced by the atmosphere,--_Astronomical\r\nRefraction_, as it is commonly called. He represents the visual ray as\r\nrefracted in passing from the _ether_, which is above the air, into\r\nthe air; the air being bounded by a spherical surface which has for\r\nits centre \"the centre of all the elements, the centre of the earth;\"\r\nand the refraction being a flexure towards the line drawn\r\nperpendicular to this surface. He thus constructs, says Delambre, the\r\nsame figure on which Cassini afterwards founded the whole of his\r\ntheory; and gives a theory more complete than that of any astronomer\r\nprevious to him. Tycho, for instance, believed that astronomical\r\nrefraction was caused only by the _vapors_ of the atmosphere, and did\r\nnot exist above the altitude of 45°.\r\n\r\nCleomedes, about the time of Augustus, had guessed at Refraction, as\r\nan explanation of an eclipse in which the sun and moon are both seen\r\nat the same time. \"Is it not possible,\" he says, \"that the ray which\r\nproceeds from the eye and traverses moist and cloudy air may bend\r\ndownwards to the sun, even when he is below the horizon?\" And Sextus\r\nEmpiricus, a century later, says, \"The air being dense, by the\r\nrefraction of the visual ray, a constellation may be seen above the\r\nhorizon when it is yet below the horizon.\" But from what follows, it\r\n{104} appears doubtful whether he clearly distinguished Refraction\r\nand Reflection.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may not attach too much value to the vague\r\nexpressions of Cleomedes and Sextus Empiricus, we may remark that\r\nCleomedes conceives such an eclipse as he describes not to be\r\npossible, though he offers an explanation of it if it be: (the fact\r\nmust really occur whenever the moon is seen in the horizon in the\r\nmiddle of an eclipse:) and that Sextus Empiricus gives his\r\nsuggestion of the effect of refraction as an argument why the\r\nChaldean astrology cannot be true, since the constellation which\r\nappears to be rising at the moment of a birth is not the one which\r\nis truly rising. The Chaldeans might have answered, says Delambre,\r\nthat the star begins to shed its influence, not when it is really in\r\nthe horizon, but when its light is seen. (_Ast. Anc._ vol. i. p.\r\n231, and vol. ii. p. 548.)\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Vitellio, or Vitello, whom we shall hereafter\r\nhave to speak of in the history of Optics, took his Tables of\r\nRefractions from Ptolemy. This is contrary to what Delambre states.\r\nHe says that Vitello may be accused of plagiarism from Alhazen, and\r\nthat Alhazen did not borrow his Tables from Ptolemy. Roger Bacon had\r\nsaid (_Opus Majus_, p. 288), \"Ptolemæus in libro de Opticis, id est,\r\nde Aspectibus, seu in Perspectivâ suâ, qui prius quam Alhazen dedit\r\nhanc sententiam, quam a Ptolemæo acceptam Alhazen exposuit.\" This\r\nrefers only to the opinion that visual rays proceed from the eye.\r\nBut this also is erroneous; for Alhazen maintains the contrary:\r\n\"Visio fit radiis a visibili extrinsecus ad visum manantibus.\"\r\n(_Opt._ Lib. i. cap. 5.) Vitello says of his Table of Refractions,\r\n\"Acceptis instrumentaliter, prout potuimus propinquius, angulis\r\nomnium refractionum . . . invenimus quod semper iidem sunt anguli\r\nrefractionum: . . . secundum hoc fecimus has tabulas.\" \"Having\r\nmeasured, by means of instruments, as exactly as we could, the whole\r\nrange of the angles of refraction, we found that the refraction is\r\nalways the same for the same angle; and hence we have constructed\r\nthese Tables.\" {105}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST STAGES OF HARMONICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG the ancients, the science of Music was an application of\r\nArithmetic, as Optics and Mechanics were of Geometry. The story\r\nwhich is told concerning the origin of their arithmetical music, is\r\nthe following, as it stands in the Arithmetical Treatise of\r\nNicomachus.\r\n\r\nPythagoras, walking one day, meditating on the means of measuring\r\nmusical notes, happened to pass near a blacksmith's shop, and had\r\nhis attention arrested by hearing the hammers, as they struck the\r\nanvil, produce the sounds which had a musical relation to each\r\nother. On listening further, he found that the intervals were a\r\nFourth, a Fifth, and an Octave; and on weighing the hammers, it\r\nappeared that the one which gave the Octave was _one-half_ the\r\nheaviest, the one which gave the Fifth was _two-thirds_, and the one\r\nwhich gave the Fourth was _three-quarters_. He returned home,\r\nreflected upon this phenomenon, made trials, and finally discovered,\r\nthat if he stretched musical strings of equal lengths, by weights\r\nwhich have the proportion of one-half, two-thirds, and\r\nthree-fourths, they produced intervals which were an Octave, a\r\nFifth, and a Fourth. This observation gave an arithmetical measure\r\nof the principal Musical Intervals, and made Music an arithmetical\r\nsubject of speculation.\r\n\r\nThis story, if not entirely a philosophical fable, is undoubtedly\r\ninaccurate; for the musical intervals thus spoken of would not be\r\nproduced by striking with hammers of the weights there stated. But\r\nit is true that the notes of strings have a definite relation to the\r\nforces which stretch them; and this truth is still the groundwork of\r\nthe theory of musical concords and discords.\r\n\r\nNicomachus says that Pythagoras found the weights to be, as I have\r\nmentioned, in the proportion of 12, 6, 8, 9; and the intervals, an\r\nOctave, corresponding to the proportion 12 to 6, or 2 to 1; a Fifth,\r\ncorresponding to the proportion 12 to 8, or 3 to 2; and a Fourth,\r\ncorresponding to the proportion 12 to 9, or 4 to 3. There is no\r\ndoubt that this statement of the ancient writer is inexact as to the\r\nphysical fact, for the rate of vibration of a string, on which its\r\nnote depends, is, {106} other things being equal, not as the weight,\r\nbut as the square root of the weight. But he is right as to the\r\nessential point, that those ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 2, and 4 to 3,\r\nare the characteristic ratios of the Octave, Fifth, and Fourth. In\r\norder to produce these intervals, the appended weights must be, not\r\nas 12, 9, 8, and 6, but as 12, 6¾, 5⅓, and 3.\r\n\r\nThe numerical relations of the other intervals of the musical scale,\r\nas well as of the Octave, Fifth, and Fourth, were discovered by the\r\nGreeks. Thus they found that the proportion in a Major Third was 5\r\nto 4; in a Minor Third, 6 to 5; in a Major Tone, 9 to 8; in a\r\nSemitone or _Diesis_, 16 to 15. They even went so far as to\r\ndetermine the _Comma_, in which the interval of two notes is so\r\nsmall that they are in the proportion of 81 to 80. This is the\r\ninterval between two notes, each of which may be called the\r\nSeventeenth above the key-note;--the one note being obtained by\r\nascending a Fifth four times over; the other being obtained by\r\nascending through two Octaves and a Major Third. The want of exact\r\ncoincidence between these two notes is an inherent arithmetical\r\nimperfection in the musical scale, of which the consequences are\r\nvery extensive.\r\n\r\nThe numerical properties of the musical scale were worked out to a\r\nvery great extent by the Greeks, and many of their Treatises on this\r\nsubject remain to us. The principal ones are the seven authors\r\npublished by Meibomius.[2\\2] These arithmetical elements of Music\r\nare to the present day important and fundamental portions of the\r\nScience of Harmonics.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\2: _Antiquæ Musicæ Scriptores septem_, 1652.]\r\n\r\nIt may at first appear that the truth, or even the possibility of\r\nthis history, by referring the discovery to accident, disproves our\r\ndoctrine, that this, like all other fundamental discoveries,\r\nrequired a distinct and well-pondered Idea as its condition. In\r\nthis, however, as in all cases of supposed accidental discoveries in\r\nscience, it will be found, that it was exactly the possession of\r\nsuch an Idea which made the accident possible.\r\n\r\nPythagoras, assuming the truth of the tradition, must have had an\r\nexact and ready apprehension of those relations of musical sounds,\r\nwhich are called respectively an Octave, a Fifth, and a Fourth. If\r\nhe had not been able to conceive distinctly this relation, and to\r\napprehend it when heard, the sounds of the anvil would have struck\r\nhis ears to no more purpose than they did those of the smiths\r\nthemselves. He {107} must have had, too, a ready familiarity with\r\nnumerical ratios; and, moreover (that in which, probably, his\r\nsuperiority most consisted), a disposition to connect one notion\r\nwith the other--the musical relation with the arithmetical, if it\r\nwere found possible. When the connection was once suggested, it was\r\neasy to devise experiments by which it might be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\"The philosophers of the Pythagorean School,[3\\2] and in particular,\r\nLasus of Hermione, and Hippasus of Metapontum, made many such\r\nexperiments upon strings; varying both their lengths and the weights\r\nwhich stretched them; and also upon vessels filled with water, in a\r\ngreater or less degree.\" And thus was established that connection of\r\nthe Idea with the Fact, which this Science, like all others,\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\2: Montucla, iii. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall quit the Physical Sciences of Ancient Greece, with the above\r\nbrief statement of the discovery of the fundamental principles which\r\nthey involved; not only because such initial steps must always be\r\nthe most important in the progress of science, but because, in\r\nreality, the Greeks made no advances beyond these. There took place\r\namong them no additional inductive processes, by which new facts\r\nwere brought under the dominion of principles, or by which\r\nprinciples were presented in a more comprehensive shape than before.\r\nTheir advance terminated in a single stride. Archimedes had stirred\r\nthe intellectual world, but had not put it in progressive motion:\r\nthe science of Mechanics stopped where he left it. And though, in\r\nsome objects, as in Harmonics, much was written, the works thus\r\nproduced consisted of deductions from the fundamental principles, by\r\nmeans of arithmetical calculations; occasionally modified, indeed,\r\nby reference to the pleasures which music, as an art, affords, but\r\nnot enriched by any new scientific truths.\r\n\r\n[3d Ed.] We should, however, quit the philosophy of the ancient\r\nGreeks without a due sense of the obligations which Physical Science\r\nin all succeeding ages owes to the acute and penetrating spirit in\r\nwhich their inquiries in that region of human knowledge were\r\nconducted, and to the large and lofty aspirations which were\r\ndisplayed, even in their failure, if we did not bear in mind both\r\nthe multifarious and comprehensive character of their attempts, and\r\nsome of the causes which limited their progress in positive science.\r\nThey speculated and {108} theorized under a lively persuasion that a\r\nScience of every part of nature was possible, and was a fit object\r\nfor the exercise of man's best faculties; and they were speedily led\r\nto the conviction that such a science must clothe its conclusions in\r\nthe language of mathematics. This conviction is eminently\r\nconspicuous in the writings of Plato. In the _Republic_, in the\r\n_Epinomis_, and above all in the _Timæus_, this conviction makes him\r\nreturn, again and again, to a discussion of the laws which had been\r\nestablished or conjectured in his time, respecting Harmonics and\r\nOptics, such as we have seen, and still more, respecting Astronomy,\r\nsuch as we shall see in the next Book. Probably no succeeding step\r\nin the discovery of the Laws of Nature was of so much importance as\r\nthe full adoption of this pervading conviction, that there must be\r\nMathematical Laws of Nature, and that it is the business of\r\nPhilosophy to discover these Laws. This conviction continues,\r\nthrough all the succeeding ages of the history of science, to be the\r\nanimating and supporting principle of scientific investigation and\r\ndiscovery. And, especially in Astronomy, many of the erroneous\r\nguesses which the Greeks made, contain, if not the germ, at least\r\nthe vivifying life-blood, of great truths, reserved for future ages.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Greeks not only sought such theories of special parts\r\nof nature, but a general Theory of the Universe. An essay at such a\r\ntheory is the _Timæus_ of Plato; too wide and too ambitious an\r\nattempt to succeed at that time; or, indeed, on the scale on which\r\nhe unfolds it, even in our time; but a vigorous and instructive\r\nexample of the claim which man's Intellect feels that it may make to\r\nunderstand the universal frame of things, and to render a reason for\r\nall that is presented to it by the outward senses.\r\n\r\nFurther; we see in Plato, that one of the grounds of the failure in\r\nthis attempt, was the assumption that the _reason why_ every thing is\r\nwhat it is and as it is, must be that so it is _best_, according to\r\nsome view of better or worse attainable by man. Socrates, in his\r\ndying conversation, as given in the _Phædo_, declares this to have\r\nbeen what he sought in the philosophy of his time; and tells his\r\nfriends that he turned away from the speculations of Anaxagoras\r\nbecause they did not give him such reasons for the constitution of\r\nthe world; and Plato's _Timæus_ is, in reality, an attempt to supply\r\nthis deficiency, and to present a Theory of the Universe, in which\r\nevery thing is accounted for by such reasons. Though this is a\r\nfailure, it is a noble as well as an instructive failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{109}}\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF\r\nGREEK ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤόδε δὲ μηδείς ποτε φοβηθῇ τῶν Ἑλλήνων, ὡς οὐ χρὴ περὶ τὰ θεῖα ποτὲ\r\nπραγματεύεσθαι θνητοὺς ὄντας· πᾶν δε τούτου διανοηθῆναι τοὐναντίον,\r\nὡς οὔτε ἄφρον ἔστι ποτὲ τὸ θεῖον, οὔτε ἀγνοεῖ που τὴν ἀνθρωπίνην\r\nφυσιν· ἀλλ' οἶδεν ὅτι, διδάσκοντος αὐτοῦ, ξυνακολουθήσει καὶ\r\nμαθήσεται τὰ διδάσκομενα.--PLATO, _Epinomis_, p. 988.\r\n\r\nNor should any Greek have any misgiving of this kind; that it is not\r\nfitting for us to inquire narrowly into the operations of Superior\r\nPowers, such as those by which the motions of the heavenly bodies\r\nare produced: but, on the contrary, men should consider that the\r\nDivine Powers never act without purpose, and that they know the\r\nnature of man: they know that by their guidance and aid, man may\r\nfollow and comprehend the lessons which are vouchsafed him on such\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{111}}\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE earliest and fundamental conceptions of men respecting the\r\nobjects with which Astronomy is concerned, are formed by familiar\r\nprocesses of thought, without appearing to have in them any thing\r\ntechnical or scientific. Days, Years, Months, the Sky, the\r\nConstellations, are notions which the most uncultured and incurious\r\nminds possess. Yet these are elements of the Science of Astronomy.\r\nThe reasons why, in this case alone, of all the provinces of human\r\nknowledge, men were able, at an early and unenlightened period, to\r\nconstruct a science out of the obvious facts of observation, with\r\nthe help of the common furniture of their minds, will be more\r\napparent in the course of the philosophy of science: but I may here\r\nbarely mention two of these reasons. They are, first, that the\r\nfamiliar act of thought, exercised for the common purposes of life,\r\nby which we give to an assemblage of our impressions such a unity as\r\nis implied in the above notions and terms, a Month, a Year, the Sky,\r\nand the like, is, in reality, an _inductive act_, and shares the\r\nnature of the processes by which all sciences are formed; and, in\r\nthe next place, that the ideas appropriate to the induction in this\r\ncase, are those which, even in the least cultivated minds, are very\r\nclear and definite; namely, the ideas of Space and Figure, Time and\r\nNumber, Motion and Recurrence. Hence, from their first origin, the\r\nmodifications of those ideas assume a scientific form.\r\n\r\nWe must now trace in detail the peculiar course which, in\r\nconsequence of these causes, the knowledge of man respecting the\r\nheavenly bodies took, from the earliest period of his history. {112}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST STAGES OF ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Formation of the Notion of a Year._\r\n\r\nTHE notion of a _Day_ is early and obviously impressed upon man in\r\nalmost any condition in which we can imagine him. The recurrence of\r\nlight and darkness, of comparative warmth and cold, of noise and\r\nsilence, of the activity and repose of animals;--the rising,\r\nmounting, descending, and setting of the sun;--the varying colors of\r\nthe clouds, generally, notwithstanding their variety, marked by a\r\ndaily progression of appearances;--the calls of the desire of food\r\nand of sleep in man himself, either exactly adjusted to the period\r\nof this change, or at least readily capable of being accommodated to\r\nit;--the recurrence of these circumstances at intervals, equal, so\r\nfar as our obvious judgment of the passage of time can decide; and\r\nthese intervals so short that the repetition is noticed with no\r\neffort of attention or memory;--this assemblage of suggestions makes\r\nthe notion of a Day necessarily occur to man, if we suppose him to\r\nhave the conception of Time, and of Recurrence. He naturally marks\r\nby a term such a portion of time, and such a cycle of recurrence; he\r\ncalls each portion of time, in which this series of appearances and\r\noccurrences come round, a _Day_; and such a group of particulars are\r\nconsidered as appearing or happening _in_ the same day.\r\n\r\n_A Year_ is a notion formed in the same manner; implying in the same\r\nway the notion of recurring facts; and also the faculty of arranging\r\nfacts in time, and of appreciating their recurrence. But the notion\r\nof a Year, though undoubtedly very obvious, is, on many accounts,\r\nless so than that of a Day. The repetition of similar circumstances,\r\nat equal intervals, is less manifest in this case, and the intervals\r\nbeing much longer, some exertion of memory becomes requisite in\r\norder that the recurrence may be perceived. A child might easily be\r\npersuaded that successive years were of unequal length; or, if the\r\nsummer were cold, and the spring and autumn warm, might be made to\r\nbelieve, if all who spoke in its hearing agreed to support the\r\ndelusion, that one year was two. It would be impossible to practise\r\nsuch a deception with regard to the day, without the use of some\r\nartifice beyond mere words. {113}\r\n\r\nStill, the recurrence of the appearances which suggest the notion of\r\na Year is so obvious, that we can hardly conceive man without it.\r\nBut though, in all climes and times, there would be a recurrence,\r\nand at the same interval in all, the recurring appearances would be\r\nextremely different in different countries; and the contrasts and\r\nresemblances of the seasons would be widely varied. In some places\r\nthe winter utterly alters the face of the country, converting grassy\r\nhills, deep leafy woods of various hues of green, and running\r\nwaters, into snowy and icy wastes, and bare snow-laden branches;\r\nwhile in others, the field retains its herbage, and the tree its\r\nleaves, all the year; and the rains and the sunshine alone, or\r\nvarious agricultural employments quite different from ours, mark the\r\npassing seasons. Yet in all parts of the world the yearly cycle of\r\nchanges has been singled out from all others, and designated by a\r\npeculiar name. The inhabitant of the equatorial regions has the sun\r\nvertically over him at the end of every period of six months, and\r\nsimilar trains of celestial phenomena fill up each of these\r\nintervals, yet we do not find years of six months among such\r\nnations. The Arabs alone,[1\\3] who practise neither agriculture nor\r\nnavigation, have a year depending upon the moon only; and borrow the\r\nword from other languages, when they speak of the solar year.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\3: Ideler, _Berl. Trans._ 1813, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nIn general, nations have marked this portion of time by some word\r\nwhich has a reference to the returning circle of seasons and\r\nemployments. Thus the Latin _annus_ signified a ring, as we see in\r\nthe derivative _annulus_: the Greek term ἐνιαυτὸς implies something\r\nwhich _returns into itself_: and the word as it exists in Teutonic\r\nlanguages, of which our word _year_ is an example, is said to have\r\nits origin in the word _yra_ which means a ring in Swedish, and is\r\nperhaps connected with the Latin _gyrus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Fixation of the Civil Year._\r\n\r\nTHE year, considered as a recurring cycle of seasons and of general\r\nappearances, must attract the notice of man as soon as his attention\r\nand memory suffice to bind together the parts of a succession of the\r\nlength of several years. But to make the same term imply a certain\r\nfixed number of days, we must know how many days the cycle of the\r\nseasons occupies; a knowledge which requires faculties and artifices\r\nbeyond what we have already mentioned. For instance, men cannot\r\nreckon as far as any number at all approaching the number of days in\r\nthe year, without possessing a system of numeral terms, and methods\r\n{114} of practical numeration on which such a system of terms is\r\nalways founded.[2\\3] The South American Indians, the Koussa Caffres\r\nand Hottentots, and the natives of New Holland, all of whom are said\r\nto be unable to reckon further than the fingers of their hands and\r\nfeet,[3\\3] cannot, as we do, include in their notion of a year the\r\nfact of its consisting of 365 days. This fact is not likely to be\r\nknown to any nation except those which have advanced far beyond that\r\nwhich may be considered as the earliest scientific process which we\r\ncan trace in the history of the human race, the formation of a\r\nmethod of designating the successive numbers to an indefinite\r\nextent, by means of names, framed according to the decimal, quinary,\r\nor vigenary scale.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\3: _Arithmetic_ in _Encyc. Metrop._ (by Dr. Peacock), Art. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\3: Ibid. Art. 32.]\r\n\r\nBut even if we suppose men to have the habit of recording the\r\npassage of each day, and of counting the score thus recorded, it\r\nwould be by no means easy for them to determine the exact number of\r\ndays in which the cycle of the seasons recurs; for the\r\nindefiniteness of the appearances which mark the same season of the\r\nyear, and the changes to which they are subject as the seasons are\r\nearly or late, would leave much uncertainty respecting the duration\r\nof the year. They would not obtain any accuracy on this head, till\r\nthey had attended for a considerable time to the motions and places\r\nof the sun; circumstances which require more precision of notice\r\nthan the general facts of the degrees of heat and light. The motions\r\nof the sun, the succession of the places of his rising and setting\r\nat different times of the year, the greatest heights which he\r\nreaches, the proportion of the length of day and night, would all\r\nexhibit several cycles. The turning back of the sun, when he had\r\nreached the greatest distance to the south or to the north, as shown\r\neither by his rising or by his height at noon, would perhaps be the\r\nmost observable of such circumstances. Accordingly the τροπαὶ\r\nἠελίοιο, the turnings of the sun, are used repeatedly by Hesiod as a\r\nmark from which he reckons the seasons of various employments.\r\n\"Fifty days,\" he says, \"after the turning of the sun, is a\r\nseasonable time for beginning a voyage.\"[4\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\3:  Ἤματα πεντήκοντα μετὰ τροπὰς ἠελίοιο\r\n            Ἐς τέλος ἐλθόντος θέρεος.--_Op. et Dies_, 661.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena would be different in different climates, but the\r\nrecurrence would be common to all. Any one of these kinds of\r\nphenomena, noted with moderate care for a year, would show what was\r\nthe number of days of which a year consisted; and if several years\r\n{115} were included in the interval through which the scrutiny\r\nextended, the knowledge of the length of the year so acquired would\r\nbe proportionally more exact.\r\n\r\nBesides those notices of the sun which offered exact indications of\r\nthe seasons, other more indefinite natural occurrences were used; as\r\nthe arrival of the swallow (χελιδών) and the kite (ἰκτίν), The\r\nbirds, in Aristophanes' play of that name, mention it as one of\r\ntheir offices to mark the seasons; Hesiod similarly notices the cry\r\nof the crane as an indication of the departure of winter.[5\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\3: Ideler, i. 240.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks the seasons were at first only summer and winter\r\n(θέρος and χειμών), the latter including all the rainy and cold\r\nportion of the year. The winter was then subdivided into the χειμών\r\nand ἔαρ (winter proper and spring), and the summer, less definitely,\r\ninto θέρος and ὀπώρα (summer and autumn). Tacitus says that the\r\nGermans knew neither the blessings nor the name of autumn, \"Autumni\r\nperinde nomen ac bona ignorantur.\" Yet _harvest_, _herbst_, is\r\ncertainly an old German word.[6\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\3: Ib. i. 243.]\r\n\r\nIn the same period in which the sun goes through his cycle of\r\npositions, the stars also go through a cycle of appearances\r\nbelonging to them; and these appearances were perhaps employed at as\r\nearly a period as those of the sun, in determining the exact length\r\nof the year. Many of the groups of fixed stars are readily\r\nrecognized, as exhibiting always the same configuration; and\r\nparticular bright stars are singled out as objects of attention.\r\nThese are observed, at particular seasons, to appear in the west\r\nafter sunset; but it is noted that when they do this, they are found\r\nnearer and nearer to the sun every successive evening, and at last\r\ndisappear in his light. It is observed also, that at a certain\r\ninterval after this, they rise visibly before the dawn of day\r\nrenders the stars invisible; and after they are seen to do this,\r\nthey rise every day at a longer interval before the sun. The risings\r\nand settings of the stars under these circumstances, or under others\r\nwhich are easily recognized, were, in countries where the sky is\r\nusually clear, employed at an early period to mark the seasons of\r\nthe year. Eschylus[7\\3] makes Prometheus mention this among the\r\nbenefits of which {116} he, the teacher of arts to the earliest race\r\nof men, was the communicator.\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\3: Οὔκ ἤν γαρ αὐτοῖς οὔτε χείματος τέκμαρ,\r\n           Οὔτ' ἀνθεμώδους ἦρος, οὔδε καρπίμου\r\n           Θέρους βέβαιον· ἀλλ' ἄτερ γνώμης τὸ πᾶν\r\n           Ἔπρασσον, ἔστε δή σφιν ἀνατολὰς ἐγὼ\r\n           Ἄστρων ἔδειξα, τάς τε δυσκρίτους δύσεις.--_Prom. V._ 454.]\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, the rising[8\\3] of the Pleiades in the evening\r\nwas a mark of the approach of winter. The rising of the waters of\r\nthe Nile in Egypt coincided with the heliacal rising of Sirius,\r\nwhich star the Egyptians called Sothis. Even without any artificial\r\nmeasure of time or position, it was not difficult to carry\r\nobservations of this kind to such a degree of accuracy as to learn\r\nfrom them the number of days which compose the year; and to fix the\r\nprecise season from the appearance of the stars.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\3: Ideler (Chronol. i. 242) says that _this_ rising of the\r\nPleiades took place at a time of the year which corresponds to our\r\n11th May, and the setting to the 20th October; but this does not\r\nagree with the forty days of their being \"concealed,\" which, from\r\nthe context, must mean, I conceive, the interval between their\r\nsetting and rising. Pliny, however, says, \"Vergiliarum exortu æstas\r\nincipit, occasu hiems; _semestri_ spatio intra se messes\r\nvindemiasque et omnium maturitatem complexæ.\" (H. N. xviii. 69.)\r\n\r\nThe autumn of the Greeks, ὀπώρα, was earlier than our autumn, for\r\nHomer calls Sirius ἀστὴρ ὀπωρινός, which rose at the end of July.]\r\n\r\nA knowledge concerning the stars appears to have been first\r\ncultivated with the last-mentioned view, and makes its first\r\nappearance in literature with this for its object. Thus Hesiod\r\ndirects the husbandman when to reap by the rising, and when to\r\nplough by the setting of the Pleiades.[9\\3] In like manner\r\nSirius,[10\\3] Arcturus,[11\\3] the Hyades and Orion,[12\\3] are\r\nnoticed. {117}\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\3: Πληίαδων Ἀτλαγενέων ἐπιτελλομενάων.\r\n           Ἄρχεσθ' ἀμητοῦ· ἀρότοιο δὲ, δυσομενάων.\r\n           Αἵ δή τοι νύκτας τε καὶ ἤματα τεσσεράκοντα\r\n           Κεκρύφαται, αὔτις δὲ περιπλομένου ἐνιαυτοῦ\r\n           Φαίνονται.               _Op. et Dies_, l. 381.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\3: Ib. l. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\3: Εὖτ' ἂν δ' ἑξήκοντα μετὰ τροπὰς ἠελίοιο\r\n            Χειμέρι', ἐκτελέσῃ Ζεὺς ἤματα, δή ῥα τότ' ἀστὴρ\r\n            Ἀρκτοῦρος, προλιπὼν ἱερὸν ῥόον Ὠκεανοῖο\r\n            Πρῶτον παμφαίνων ἐπιτέλλεται ἀκροκνέφαιος.\r\n                                    _Op. et Dies_, l. 562.\r\n\r\n            Εὖτ' ἂν δ' Ὠρίων καὶ Σείριος ἐς μέσον ἔλθῃ\r\n            Οὐρανὸν, Ἀρκτοῦρον δ' ἐσὶδῃ ῥοδοδάκτυλος ἠὼς.\r\n                                          Ib. 607.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\3: . . . . . . . αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ\r\n            Πληϊάδες Ὑάδες τε τὸ τε σθένος Ὠρίωνος\r\n            Δύνωσιν.                      Ib. 612.\r\n\r\nThese methods were employed to a late period, because the Greek\r\nmonths, being lunar, did not correspond to the seasons. Tables of\r\nsuch motions were called παραπήγματα.--Ideler, _Hist.\r\nUntersuchungen_, p. 209.]\r\n\r\nBy such means it was determined that the year consisted, at least,\r\nnearly, of 365 days. The Egyptians, as we learn from\r\nHerodotus,[13\\3] claimed the honor of this discovery. The priests\r\ninformed him, he says, \"that the Egyptians were the first men who\r\ndiscovered the year, dividing it into twelve equal parts; and this\r\nthey asserted that they discovered from the stars.\" Each of these\r\nparts or months consisted of 30 days, and they added 5 days more at\r\nthe end of the year, \"and thus the circle of the seasons come\r\nround.\" It seems, also, that the Jews, at an early period, had a\r\nsimilar reckoning of time, for the Deluge which continued 150 days\r\n(Gen. vii. 24), is stated to have lasted from the 17th day of the\r\nsecond month (Gen. vii. 11) to the 17th day of the seventh month\r\n(Gen. viii. 4), that is, 5 months of 30 days.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\3: Ib. ii. 4.]\r\n\r\nA year thus settled as a period of a certain number of days is\r\ncalled a _Civil Year_. It is one of the earliest discoverable\r\ninstitutions of States possessing any germ of civilization; and one\r\nof the earliest portions of human systematic knowledge is the\r\ndiscovery of the length of the civil year, so that it should agree\r\nwith the natural year, or year of the seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Correction of the Civil Year._ (_Julian Calendar._)\r\n\r\nIN reality, by such a mode of reckoning as we have described, the\r\ncircle of the seasons would not come round exactly. The real length of\r\nthe year is very nearly 365 days and a quarter. If a year of 365 days\r\nwere used, in four years the year would begin a day too soon, when\r\nconsidered with reference to the sun and stars; and in 60 years it\r\nwould begin 15 days too soon: a quantity perceptible to the loosest\r\ndegree of attention. The civil year would be found not to coincide\r\nwith the year of the seasons; the beginning of the former would take\r\nplace at different periods of the latter; it would _wander_ into\r\nvarious seasons, instead of remaining fixed to the same season; the\r\nterm _year_, and any number of years, would become ambiguous: some\r\ncorrection, at least some comparison, would be requisite.\r\n\r\nWe do not know by whom the insufficiency of the year of 365 days was\r\nfirst discovered;[14\\3] we find this knowledge diffused among all\r\ncivilized nations, and various artifices used in making the\r\ncorrection. The method which we employ, and which consists in\r\nreckoning an {118} additional day at the end of February every fourth\r\nor _leap_ year, is an example of the principle of _intercalation_, by\r\nwhich the correction was most commonly made. Methods of intercalation\r\nfor the same purpose were found to exist in the new world. The\r\nMexicans added 13 days at the end of every 52 years. The method of the\r\nGreeks was more complex (by means of the _octaëteris_ or cycle of 8\r\nyears); but it had the additional object of accommodating itself to\r\nthe motions of the moon, and therefore must be treated of hereafter.\r\nThe Egyptians, on the other hand, knowingly permitted their civil year\r\nto _wander_, at least so far as their religious observances were\r\nconcerned. \"They do not wish,\" says Geminus,[15\\3] \"the same\r\nsacrifices of the gods to be made perpetually at the same time of the\r\nyear, but that they should go through all the seasons, so that the\r\nsame feast may happen in summer and winter, in spring and autumn.\" The\r\nperiod in which any festival would thus pass through all the seasons\r\nof the year is 1461 years; for 1460 years of 365¼ days are equal to\r\n1461 years of 365 days. This period of 1461 years is called the\r\n_Sothic_ Period, from Sothis, the name of the Dog-star, by which their\r\n_fixed_ year was determined; and for the same reason it is called the\r\n_Canicular_ Period.[16\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\3: Syncellus (_Chronographia_, p. 123) says that according\r\nto the legend, it was King Aseth who first added the 5 additional\r\ndays to 360, for the year, in the eighteenth century, B. C.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\3: _Uranol._ p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\3: Censorinus _de Die Natali_, c. 18.]\r\n\r\nOther nations did not regulate their civil year by intercalation at\r\nshort intervals, but rectified it by a _reform_ when this became\r\nnecessary. The Persians are said to have added a month of 30 days\r\nevery 120 years. The Roman calendar, at first very rude in its\r\nstructure, was reformed by Numa, and was directed to be kept in\r\norder by the perpetual interposition of the augurs. This, however,\r\nwas, from various causes, not properly done; and the consequence\r\nwas, that the reckoning fell into utter disorder, in which state it\r\nwas found by Julius Cæsar, when he became dictator. By the advice of\r\nSosigenes, he adopted the mode of intercalation of one day in 4\r\nyears, which we still retain; and in order to correct the\r\nderangement which had already been produced, he added 90 days to a\r\nyear of the usual length, which thus became what was called _the\r\nyear of confusion_. The _Julian Calendar_, thus reformed, came into\r\nuse, January 1, B. C. 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Attempts at the Fixation of the Month._\r\n\r\nTHE circle of changes through which the moon passes in about thirty\r\ndays, is marked, in the earliest stages of language, by a word which\r\nimplies the space of time which one such circle occupies; just {119}\r\nas the circle of changes of the seasons is designated by the word\r\n_year_. The lunar changes are, indeed, more obvious to the sense,\r\nand strike a more careless person, than the annual; the moon, when\r\nthe sun is absent, is almost the sole natural object which attracts\r\nour notice; and we look at her with a far more tranquil and\r\nagreeable attention than we bestow on any other celestial object.\r\nHer changes of form and place are definite and striking to all eyes;\r\nthey are uninterrupted, and the duration of their cycle is so short\r\nas to require no effort of memory to embrace it. Hence it appears to\r\nbe more easy, and in earlier stages of civilization more common, to\r\ncount time by _moons_ than by years.\r\n\r\nThe words by which this period of time is designated in various\r\nlanguages, seem to refer us to the early history of language. Our\r\nword _month_ is connected with the word _moon_, and a similar\r\nconnection is noticeable in the other branches of the Teutonic. The\r\nGreek word μὴν in like manner is related to μήνη, which though not\r\nthe common word for the moon, is found in Homer with that\r\nsignification. The Latin word _mensis_ is probably connected with\r\nthe same group.[17\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\3: Cicero derives this word from the verb _to measure_:\r\n\"quia _mensa_ spatia conficiunt, _menses_ nominantur;\" and other\r\netymologists, with similar views, connect the above-mentioned words\r\nwith the Hebrew _manah_, to measure (with which the Arabic word\r\n_almanach_ is connected). Such a derivation would have some analogy\r\nwith that of _annus_, &c., noticed above: but if we are to attempt\r\nto ascend to the earliest condition of language, we must conceive it\r\nprobable that men would have a name for a most conspicuous visible\r\nobject, _the moon_, before they would have a verb denoting the very\r\nabstract and general notion, _to measure_.]\r\n\r\nThe month is not any exact number of days, being more than 29, and\r\nless than 30. The latter number was first tried, for men more\r\nreadily select numbers possessing some distinction of regularity. It\r\nexisted for a long period in many countries. A very few months of 30\r\ndays, however, would suffice to derange the agreement between the\r\ndays of the months and the moon's appearance. A little further trial\r\nwould show that months of 29 and 30 days alternately, would\r\npreserve, for a considerable period, this agreement.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks adopted this calendar, and, in consequence, considered\r\nthe days of their month as representing the changes of the moon: the\r\nlast day of the month was called ἔνη καὶ νέα, \"the old and new\" as\r\nbelonging to both the waning and the reappearing moon:[18\\3] and\r\ntheir {120} festivals and sacrifices, as determined by the calendar,\r\nwere conceived to be necessarily connected with the same periods of\r\nthe cycles of the sun and moon. \"The laws and the oracles,\" says\r\nGeminus, \"which directed that they should in sacrifices observe\r\nthree things, months, days, years, were so understood.\" With this\r\npersuasion, a correct system of intercalation became a religious\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\3: Aratus says of the moon, in a passage quoted by Geminus,\r\np. 33:\r\n  Αἴει δ' ἄλλοθεν ἄλλα παρακλίνουσα μετωπὰ\r\n  Εἴρῃ, ὁποσταίη μήνος περιτέλλεται ἡὼς\r\n  As still her shifting visage changing turns,\r\n  By her we count the monthly round of morns.]\r\n\r\nThe above rule of alternate months of 29 and 30 days, supposes the\r\nlength of the months 29 days and a half, which is not exactly the\r\nlength of a lunar month. Accordingly the Months and the Moon were\r\nsoon at variance. Aristophanes, in \"The Clouds,\" makes the Moon\r\ncomplain of the disorder when the calendar was deranged.\r\n\r\n                        Οὐκ ἄγειν τὰς ἡμέρας\r\n  Οὐδὲν ὀρθῶς, ἀλλ' ἀνω τε καὶ κάτω κυδοιδοπᾶν\r\n  Ὥστ' ἀπειλεῖν φησὶν αὐτῇ τοὐς θεοὺς ἑκάστοτε\r\n  Ἡνίκ' ἂν ψευσθῶσι δείπνου κἀπίωσιν οἴκαδε\r\n  Τῆς ἑορτῆς μὴ τυχόντες κατὰ λόγον τῶν ἡμερῶν.\r\n          _Nubes_, 615-19.\r\n\r\n     CHORUS OF CLOUDS.\r\n\r\n  The Moon by us to you her greeting sends,\r\n  But bids us say that she's an ill-used moon,\r\n  And takes it much amiss that you should still\r\n  Shuffle her days, and turn them topsy-turvy:\r\n  And that the gods (who know their feast-days well)\r\n  By your false count are sent home supperless,\r\n  And scold and storm at her for your neglect.[19\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\3: This passage is supposed by the commentators to be\r\nintended as a satire upon those who had introduced the cycle of\r\nMeton (spoken of in Sect. 5), which had been done at Athens a few\r\nyears before \"The Clouds\" was acted.]\r\n\r\nThe correction of this inaccuracy, however, was not pursued\r\nseparately, but was combined with another object, the securing a\r\ncorrespondence between the lunar and solar years, the main purpose\r\nof all early cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Invention of Lunisolar Years._\r\n\r\nTHERE are 12 complete lunations in a year; which according to the\r\nabove rule (of 29½ days to a lunation) would make 354 days, leaving\r\n12¼ days of difference between such a lunar year and a solar year.\r\nIt is said that, at an early period, this was attempted to be\r\ncorrected by interpolating a month of 30 days every alternate year;\r\nand Herodotus[20\\3] relates a conversation of Solon, implying a\r\nstill ruder mode of {121} intercalation. This can hardly be\r\nconsidered as an improvement in the Greek calendar already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\3: B. i. c. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe first cycle which produced any near correspondence of the\r\nreckoning of the moon and the sun, was the _Octaëteris_, or period\r\nof 8 years: 8 years of 354 days, together with 3 months of 30 days\r\neach, making up (in 99 lunations) 2922 days; which is exactly the\r\namount of 8 years of 365¼ days each. Hence this period would answer\r\nits purpose, so far as the above lengths of the lunar and solar\r\ncycles are exact; and it might assume various forms, according to\r\nthe manner in which the three intercalary months were distributed.\r\nThe customary method was to add a thirteenth month at the end of the\r\nthird, fifth, and eighth year of the cycle. This period is ascribed\r\nto various persons and times; probably different persons proposed\r\ndifferent forms of it. Dodwell places its introduction in the 59th\r\nOlympiad, or in the 6th century, B. C.: but Ideler thinks the\r\nastronomical knowledge of the Greeks of that age was too limited to\r\nallow of such a discovery.\r\n\r\nThis cycle, however, was imperfect. The duration of 99 lunations is\r\nsomething more than 2922 days; it is more nearly 2923½; hence in 16\r\nyears there was a deficiency of 3 days, with regard to the motions\r\nof the moon. This cycle of 16 years (_Heccædecaëteris_), with 3\r\ninterpolated days at the end, was used, it is said, to bring the\r\ncalculation right with regard to the moon; but in this way the\r\norigin of the year was displaced with regard to the sun. After 10\r\nrevolutions of this cycle, or 160 years, the interpolated days would\r\namount to 30, and hence the end of the lunar year would be a month\r\nin advance of the end of the solar. By terminating the lunar year at\r\nthe end of the preceding month, the two years would again be brought\r\ninto agreement: and we have thus a cycle of 160 years.[21\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\3: Geminus. Ideler.]\r\n\r\nThis cycle of 160 years, however, was calculated from the cycle of\r\n16 years; and it was probably never used in civil reckoning; which\r\nthe others, or at least that of 8 years, appear to have been.\r\n\r\nThe cycles of 16 and 160 years were corrections of the cycle of 8\r\nyears; and were readily suggested, when the length of the solar and\r\nlunar periods became known with accuracy. But a much more exact\r\ncycle, independent of these, was discovered and introduced by\r\nMeton,[22\\3] 432 years B. C. This cycle consisted of 19 years, and\r\nis so correct and convenient, that it is in use among ourselves to\r\nthis day. The time occupied by 19 years, and by 235 lunations, is\r\nvery nearly the same; {122} (the former time is less than 6940 days\r\nby 9½ hours, the latter, by 7½ hours). Hence, if the 19 years be\r\ndivided into 235 months, so as to agree with the changes of the\r\nmoon, at the end of that period the same succession may begin again\r\nwith great exactness.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\3: Ideler, _Hist. Unters._ p. 208.]\r\n\r\nIn order that 235 months, of 30 and 29 days, may make up 6940 days,\r\nwe must have 125 of the former, which were called _full_ months, and\r\n110 of the latter, which were termed _hollow_. An artifice was used\r\nin order to distribute 110 hollow months among 6940 days. It will be\r\nfound that there is a hollow month for each 63 days nearly. Hence if\r\nwe reckon 30 days to every month, but at every 63d day leap over a\r\nday in the reckoning, we shall, in the 19 years, omit 110 days; and\r\nthis accordingly was done. Thus the 3d day of the 3d month, the 6th\r\nday of the 5th month, the 9th day of the 7th, must be omitted, so as\r\nto make these months \"hollow.\" Of the 19 years, seven must consist\r\nof 13 months; and it does not appear to be known according to what\r\norder these seven years were selected. Some say they were the 3d,\r\n6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th; others, the 3d, 5th, 8th,\r\n11th, 13th, 16th, and 19th.\r\n\r\nThe near coincidence of the solar and lunar periods in this cycle of\r\n19 years, was undoubtedly a considerable discovery at the time when\r\nit was first accomplished. It is not easy to trace the way in which\r\nsuch a discovery was made at that time; for we do not even know the\r\nmanner in which men then recorded the agreement or difference\r\nbetween the calendar day and the celestial phenomenon which ought to\r\ncorrespond to it. It is most probable that the length of the month\r\nwas obtained with some exactness by the observation of eclipses, at\r\nconsiderable intervals of time from each other; for eclipses are\r\nvery noticeable phenomena, and must have been very soon observed to\r\noccur only at new and full moon.[23\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\3: Thucyd. vii. 50. Ἡ σελήνη ἐκλείπει· ἐτύγχανε γὰρ\r\n_πανσέληνος_ οὖσα. iv. 52, Τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπές τι ἐγένετο _περὶ\r\nνουμηνίαν_. ii. 28. Νουμηνίᾳ κατὰ _σελήνην_ (ὥσπερ καὶ μόνον δοκεῖ\r\nεἶναι γίγνεσθαι δυνατὸν) ὁ ἡλίος ἐξέλιπε μετὰ μεσημβρίαν καὶ πάλιν\r\nἀν ἐπληρώθη, γενόμενος μηνοειδὴς καὶ ἀστέρων τινῶν ἐκφανέντων.]\r\n\r\nThe exact length of a certain number of months being thus known, the\r\ndiscovery of a cycle which should regulate the calendar with\r\nsufficient accuracy would be a business of arithmetical skill, and\r\nwould depend, in part, on the existing knowledge of arithmetical\r\nmethods; but in making the discovery, a natural arithmetical\r\nsagacity was probably more efficacious than method. It is very\r\npossible that the _Cycle of Meton_ is correct more nearly than its\r\nauthor was aware, and {123} nearly than he could ascertain from any\r\nevidence and calculation known to him. It is so exact that it is\r\nstill used in calculating the new moon for the time of Easter; and\r\nthe _Golden Number_, which is spoken of in stating such rules, is\r\nthe number of this Cycle corresponding to the current year.[24\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\3: The same cycle of 19 years has been used by the Chinese\r\nfor a very great length of time; their civil year consisting, like\r\nthat of the Greeks, of months of 29 and 30 days. The Siamese also\r\nhave this period. (_Astron._ Lib. U. K.)]\r\n\r\nMeton's Cycle was corrected a hundred years later (330 B. C.), by\r\nCalippus, who discovered the error of it by observing an eclipse of\r\nthe moon six years before the death of Alexander.[25\\3] In this\r\ncorrected period, four cycles of 19 years were taken, and a day left\r\nout at the end of the 76 years, in order to make allowance for the\r\nhours by which, as already observed, 6940 days are greater than 19\r\nyears, and than 235 lunations: and this _Calippic period_ is used in\r\nPtolemy's Almagest, in stating observations of eclipses.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\3: Delamb. _A. A._ p. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe Metonic and Calippic periods undoubtedly imply a very\r\nconsiderable degree of accuracy in the knowledge which the\r\nastronomers, to whom they are due, had of the length of the month;\r\nand the first is a very happy invention for bringing the solar and\r\nlunar calendars into agreement.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Calendar, from which our own is derived, appears to have\r\nbeen a much less skilful contrivance than the Greek; though scholars\r\nare not agreed on the subject of its construction, we can hardly\r\ndoubt that months, in this as in other cases, were intended\r\noriginally to have a reference to the moon. In whatever manner the\r\nsolar and lunar motions were intended to be reconciled, the attempt\r\nseems altogether to have failed, and to have been soon abandoned.\r\nThe Roman months, both before and after the Julian correction, were\r\nportions of the year, having no reference to full and new moons; and\r\nwe, having adopted this division of the year, have thus, in our\r\ncommon calendar, the traces of one of the early attempts of mankind\r\nto seize the law of the succession of celestial phenomena, in a case\r\nwhere the attempt was a complete failure.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a part of the progress of our astronomical knowledge,\r\nimprovements in the calendar do not offer many points to our\r\nobservation, but they exhibit a few very important steps. Calendars\r\nwhich, belonging apparently to unscientific ages and nations,\r\npossess a great degree of accordance with the true motions of the\r\nsun and moon (like {124} the solar calendar of the Mexicans, and the\r\nlunar calendar of the Greeks), contain the only record now extant of\r\ndiscoveries which must have required a great deal of observation, of\r\nthought, and probably of time. The later improvements in calendars,\r\nwhich take place when astronomical observation has been attentively\r\npursued, are of little consequence to the history of science; for\r\nthey are generally founded on astronomical determinations, and are\r\nposterior in time, and inferior in accuracy, to the knowledge on\r\nwhich they depend. But cycles of correction, which are both short\r\nand close to exactness, like that of Meton, may perhaps be the\r\noriginal form of the knowledge which they imply; and certainly\r\nrequire both accurate facts and sagacious arithmetical reasonings.\r\nThe discovery of such a cycle must always have the appearance of a\r\nhappy guess, like other discoveries of laws of nature. Beyond this\r\npoint, the interest of the study of calendars, as bearing on our\r\nsubject, ceases: they may be considered as belonging rather to Art\r\nthan to Science; rather as an application of a part of our knowledge\r\nto the uses of life, than a means or an evidence of its extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_The Constellations._\r\n\r\nSOME tendency to consider the stars as formed into groups, is\r\ninevitable when men begin to attend to them; but how men were led to\r\nthe fanciful system of names of Stars and of Constellations, which\r\nwe find to have prevailed in early times, it is very difficult to\r\ndetermine. Single stars, and very close groups, as the Pleiades,\r\nwere named in the time of Homer and Hesiod, and at a still earlier\r\nperiod, as we find in the book of Job.[26\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\3: Job xxxviii. 31. \"Canst thou bind the sweet influences\r\nof Chima (the Pleiades), or loose the bands of Kesil (Orion)? Canst\r\nthou bring forth Mazzaroth (Sirius) in his season? or canst thou\r\nguide Ash (or Aisch) (Arcturus) with his sons?\"\r\n\r\nAnd ix. 9. \"Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the\r\nchambers of the south.\"\r\n\r\nDupuis, vi. 545, thinks that Aisch was αἴξ, the goat and kids. See\r\nHyde, _Ulughbeigh_.]\r\n\r\nTwo remarkable circumstances with respect to the Constellations are,\r\nfirst, that they appear in most cases to be arbitrary combinations;\r\nthe artificial figures which are made to include the stars, not\r\nhaving any resemblance to their obvious configurations; and second,\r\nthat these figures, in different countries, are so far similar, as\r\nto imply some communication. The arbitrary nature of these figures\r\nshows that they {125} were rather the work of the imaginative and\r\nmythological tendencies of man, than of mere convenience and love of\r\narrangement. \"The constellations,\" says an astronomer of our own\r\ntime,[27\\3] \"seem to have been almost purposely named and delineated\r\nto cause as much confusion and inconvenience as possible.\r\nInnumerable snakes twine through long and contorted areas of the\r\nheavens, where no memory can follow them: bears, lions, and fishes,\r\nlarge and small, northern and southern, confuse all nomenclature. A\r\nbetter system of constellations might have been a material help as\r\nan artificial memory.\" When men indicate the stars by figures,\r\nborrowed from obvious resemblances, they are led to combinations\r\nquite different from the received constellations. Thus the common\r\npeople in our own country find a wain or wagon, or a plough, in a\r\nportion of the great bear.[28\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\3: Sir J. Herschel.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\3: So also the Greeks, Homer, _Il._ XVIII. 487.\r\n  Ἄρκτον ἢν καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐπίκλησιν καλέουσιν.\r\n  The Northern Bear which oft the Wain they call.\r\nἌρκτος was the traditional name; ἄμαξα, that suggested by the\r\nform.]\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the constellations recognized in different\r\ncountries is very remarkable. The Chaldean, the Egyptian, and the\r\nGrecian skies have a resemblance which cannot be overlooked. Some\r\nhave conceived that this resemblance may be traced also in the\r\nIndian and Arabic constellations, at least in those of the\r\nzodiac.[29\\3] But while the figures are the same, the names and\r\ntraditions connected with them are different, according to the\r\nhistories and localities of each country;[30\\3] the river among the\r\nstars which the Greeks called the Eridanus, the Egyptians asserted\r\nto be the Nile. Some conceive that the Signs of the _Zodiac_, or\r\npath along which the sun and moon pass, had its divisions marked by\r\nsigns which had a reference to the course of the seasons, to the\r\nmotion of the sun, or the employments of the husbandman. If we take\r\nthe position of the heavens, which, from the knowledge we now\r\npossess, we are sure they must have had 15,000 years ago, the\r\nsignificance of the signs of the zodiac, in which the sun was, as\r\nreferred to the Egyptian year, becomes very marked,[31\\3] and has\r\nled some to suppose that the zodiac was invented at such a period.\r\nOthers have rejected this as an improbably great antiquity, and have\r\nthought it more likely that the constellation assigned to each\r\nseason was that which, at that season, rose at the beginning of the\r\nnight: {126} thus the balance (which is conceived to designate the\r\nequality of days and nights) was placed among the stars which rose\r\nin the evening when the spring began: this would fix the origin of\r\nthese signs 2500 years before our era.\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\3: Dupuis, vi. 548. The Indian zodiac contains, in the\r\nplace of our Capricorn, a ram _and_ a fish, which proves the\r\nresemblance without chance of mistake. Bailly, i. p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\3: Dupuis, vi. 549.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\3: Laplace, _Hist. Astron._ p. 8.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, as has already been said, that Fancy, and probably\r\nSuperstition, had a share in forming the collection of\r\nconstellations. It is certain that, at an early period,\r\nsuperstitious notions were associated with the stars.[32\\3]\r\nAstrology is of very high antiquity in the East. The stars were\r\nsupposed to influence the character and destiny of man, and to be in\r\nsome way connected with superior natures and powers.\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\3: Dupuis, vi. 546.]\r\n\r\nWe may, I conceive, look upon the formation of the constellations,\r\nand the notions thus connected with them, as a very early attempt to\r\nfind a meaning in the relations of the stars; and as an utter\r\nfailure. The first effort to associate the appearances and motions\r\nof the skies by conceptions implying unity and connection, was made\r\nin a wrong direction, as may very easily be supposed. Instead of\r\nconsidering the appearances only with reference to space, time,\r\nnumber, in a manner purely rational, a number of other elements,\r\nimagination, tradition, hope, fear, awe of the supernatural, belief\r\nin destiny, were called into action. Man, still young, as a\r\nphilosopher at least, had yet to learn what notions his successful\r\nguesses on these subjects must involve, and what they must exclude.\r\nAt that period, nothing could be more natural or excusable than this\r\nignorance; but it is curious to see how long and how obstinately the\r\nbelief lingered (if indeed it be yet extinct) that the motions of\r\nthe stars, and the dispositions and fortunes of men, may come under\r\nsome common conceptions and laws, by which a connection between the\r\none and the other may be established.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, therefore, agree with those who consider Astrology in the\r\nearly ages as \"only a degraded Astronomy, the abuse of a more\r\nancient science.\"[33\\3] It was the first step to astronomy by\r\nleading to habits and means of grouping phenomena; and, after a\r\nwhile, by showing that pictorial and mythological relations among\r\nthe stars had no very obvious value. From that time, the inductive\r\nprocess went on steadily in the true road, under the guidance of\r\nideas of space, time, and number.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\3: Ib. vi. 546.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 7.--_The Planets._\r\n\r\nWHILE men were becoming familiar with the fixed stars, the planets\r\nmust have attracted their notice. Venus, from her brightness, and\r\n{127} from her accompanying the sun at no great distance, and thus\r\nappearing as the morning and evening star, was very conspicuous.\r\nPythagoras is said to have maintained that the evening and morning\r\nstar are the same body, which certainly must have been one of the\r\nearliest discoveries on this subject; and indeed we can hardly\r\nconceive men noticing the stars for a year or two without coming to\r\nthis conclusion.\r\n\r\nJupiter and Mars, sometimes still brighter than Venus, were also\r\nvery noticeable. Saturn and Mercury were less so, but in fine\r\nclimates they and their motion would soon be detected by persons\r\nobservant of the heavens. To reduce to any rule the movements of\r\nthese luminaries must have taken time and thought; probably before\r\nthis was done, certainly very early, these heavenly bodies were\r\nbrought more peculiarly under those views which we have noticed as\r\nleading to astrology.\r\n\r\nAt a time beyond the reach of certain history, the planets, along\r\nwith the sun and moon, had been arranged in a certain recognized\r\norder by the Egyptians or some other ancient nation. Probably this\r\narrangement had been made according to the slowness of their motions\r\namong the stars; for though the motion of each is very variable, the\r\ngradation of their velocities is, on the whole, very manifest; and\r\nthe different rate of travelling of the different planets, and\r\nprobably other circumstances of difference, led, in the ready fancy\r\nof early times, to the attribution of a peculiar character to each\r\nluminary. Thus Saturn was held to be of a cold and gelid nature;\r\nJupiter, who, from his more rapid motion, was supposed to be lower\r\nin place, was temperate; Mars, fiery, and the like.[34\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\3: Achilles Tatius (_Uranol._ pp. 135, 136), gives the\r\nGrecian and Egyptian names of the planets.\r\n                Egyptian.                Greek.\r\nSaturn          Νεμεσέως           Κρόνου     ἀστὴρ φαίνων\r\nJupiter         Ὀσίριδος           Δῖος       φαέθων\r\nMars            Ἡρακλεοῦς          Ἀρέος      πυρόεις\r\nVenus                              Ἀφροδίτης  ἑώσφορος\r\nMercury         Ἀπόλλωνος          Ἑρμοῦ      στίλβων]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell on the details of these speculations,\r\nbut we may notice a very remarkable evidence of their antiquity and\r\ngenerality in the structure of one of the most familiar of our\r\nmeasures of time, the _Week_. This distribution of time according to\r\nperiods of seven days, comes down to us, as we learn from the Jewish\r\nscriptures, from the beginning of man's existence on the earth. The\r\nsame usage is found over all the East; it existed among the\r\nArabians, Assyrians, {128} Egyptians.[35\\3] The same week is found\r\nin India among the Bramins; it has there, also, its days marked by\r\nthose of the heavenly bodies; and it has been ascertained that the\r\nsame day has, in that country, the name corresponding with its\r\ndesignation in other nations.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\3: Laplace, _Hist. Astron._ p. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe notion which led to the usual designations of the days of the\r\nweek is not easily unravelled. The days each correspond to one of\r\nthe heavenly bodies, which were, in the earliest systems of the\r\nworld, conceived to be the following, enumerating them in the order\r\nof their remoteness from the earth:[36\\3] Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the\r\nSun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon. At a later period, the received\r\nsystems placed the seven luminaries in _the seven spheres_. The\r\nknowledge which was implied in this view, and the time when it was\r\nobtained, we must consider hereafter. The order in which the names\r\nare assigned to the days of the week (beginning with Saturday) is,\r\nSaturn, the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus; and\r\nvarious accounts are given of the manner in which one of these\r\norders is obtained from the other; all the methods proceeding upon\r\ncertain arbitrary arithmetical processes, connected in some way with\r\nastrological views. It is perhaps not worth our while here to\r\nexamine further the steps of this process; it would be difficult to\r\ndetermine with certainty why the former order of the planets was\r\nadopted, and how and why the latter was deduced from it. But there\r\nis something very remarkable in the universality of the notions,\r\napparently so fantastic, which have produced this result; and we may\r\nprobably consider the Week, with Laplace,[37\\3] as \"the most ancient\r\nmonument of astronomical knowledge.\" This period has gone on without\r\ninterruption or irregularity from the earliest recorded times to our\r\nown days, traversing the extent of ages and the revolutions of\r\nempires; the names of the ancient deities which were associated with\r\nthe stars have been replaced by those of the objects of the worship\r\nof our Teutonic ancestors, according to their views of the\r\ncorrespondence of the two mythologies; and the Quakers, in rejecting\r\nthese names of days, have cast aside the most ancient existing relic\r\nof astrological as well as idolatrous superstition.\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\3: _Philol. Mus._ No. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\3: _Hist. Ast._ p. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 8.--_The Circles of the Sphere._\r\n\r\nTHE inventions hitherto noticed, though undoubtedly they were steps\r\nin astronomical knowledge, can hardly be considered as purely\r\nabstract and scientific speculations; for the exact reckoning of\r\ntime is one of {129} the wants, even of the least civilized nations.\r\nBut the distribution of the places and motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies by means of a celestial sphere with imaginary lines drawn\r\nupon it, is a step in _speculative_ astronomy, and was occasioned\r\nand rendered important by the scientific propensities of man.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say with whom this notion originated. Some parts\r\nof it are obvious. The appearance of the sky naturally suggests the\r\nidea of a concave Sphere, with the stars fixed on its surface. Their\r\nmotions during any one night, it would be readily seen, might be\r\nrepresented by supposing this Sphere to turn round a Pole or Axis;\r\nfor there is a conspicuous star in the heavens which apparently\r\nstands still (the Pole-star); all the others travel round this in\r\ncircles, and keep the same positions with respect to each other.\r\nThis stationary star is every night the same, and in the same place;\r\nthe other stars also have the same relative position; but their\r\ngeneral position at the same time of night varies gradually from\r\nnight to night, so as to go through its cycle of appearances once a\r\nyear. All this would obviously agree with the supposition that the\r\nsky is a concave sphere or dome, that the stars have fixed places on\r\nthis sphere, and that it revolves perpetually and uniformly about\r\nthe Pole or fixed point.\r\n\r\nBut this supposition does not at all explain the way in which the\r\nappearances of different nights succeed each other. This, however,\r\nmay be explained, it appears, by supposing the _sun_ also _to move\r\namong the stars_ on the surface of the concave sphere. The sun by\r\nhis brightness makes the stars invisible which are on his side of\r\nthe heavens: this we can easily believe; for the moon, when bright,\r\nalso puts out all but the largest stars; and we see the stars\r\nappearing in the evening, each in its place, according to their\r\ndegree of splendor, as fast as the declining light of day allows\r\nthem to become visible. And as the sun brings day, and his absence\r\nnight, if he move through the circuit of the stars in a year, we\r\nshall have, in the course of that time, every part of the starry\r\nsphere in succession presented to us as our nocturnal sky.\r\n\r\nThis notion, _that the sun moves round among the stars in a year_,\r\nis the basis of astronomy, and a considerable part of the science is\r\nonly the development and particularization of this general\r\nconception. It is not easy to ascertain either the exact method by\r\nwhich the path of the sun among the stars was determined, or the\r\nauthor and date of the discovery. That there is some difficulty in\r\ntracing the course of the sun among the stars will be clearly seen,\r\nwhen it is considered that no {130} star can ever be seen at the\r\nsame time with the sun. If the whole circuit of the sky be divided\r\ninto twelve parts or _signs_, it is estimated by Autolycus, the\r\noldest writer on these subjects whose works remain to us,[38\\3] that\r\nthe stars which occupy one of these parts are absorbed by the solar\r\nrays, so that they cannot be seen. Hence the stars which are seen\r\nnearest to the place of the setting and the rising sun in the\r\nevening and in the morning, are distant from him by the half of a\r\nsign: the evening stars being to the west, and the morning stars to\r\nthe east of him. If the observer had previously obtained a knowledge\r\nof the places of all the principal stars, he might in this way\r\ndetermine the position of the sun each night, and thus trace his\r\npath in a year.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\3: Delamb. _A. A._ p. xiii.]\r\n\r\nIn this, or some such way, the sun's path was determined by the\r\nearly astronomers of Egypt. Thales, who is mentioned as the father\r\nof Greek astronomy, probably learnt among the Egyptians the results\r\nof such speculations, and introduced them into his own country. His\r\nknowledge, indeed, must have been a great deal more advanced than\r\nthat which we are now describing, if it be true, as is asserted,\r\nthat he predicted an eclipse. But his having done so is not very\r\nconsistent with what we are told of the steps which his successors\r\nhad still to make.\r\n\r\nThe Circle of the Signs, in which the sun moves among the stars, is\r\nobliquely situated with regard to the circles in which the stars\r\nmove about the poles. Pliny[39\\3] states that Anaximander,[40\\3] a\r\nscholar of Thales, was the first person who pointed out this\r\nobliquity, and thus, as he says, \"opened the gate of nature.\"\r\nCertainly, the person who first had a clear view of the nature of\r\nthe sun's path in the celestial sphere, made that step which led to\r\nall the rest; but it is difficult to conceive that the Egyptians and\r\nChaldeans had not already advanced so far.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\3: Lib. ii. c. (viii.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\3: Plutarch, _De Plac. Phil._ lib. ii. cap. xii. says\r\nPythagoras was the author of this discovery.]\r\n\r\nThe diurnal motion of the celestial sphere, and the motion of the\r\nmoon in the circle of the signs, gave rise to a mathematical\r\nscience, _the Doctrine of the Sphere_, which was one of the earliest\r\nbranches of applied mathematics. A number of technical conceptions\r\nand terms were soon introduced. The _Sphere_ of the heavens was\r\nconceived to be complete, though we see but a part of it; it was\r\nsupposed to turn about the visible _pole_ and another pole opposite\r\nto this, and these poles were connected by an imaginary _Axis_. The\r\ncircle which divided the sphere exactly midway between these poles\r\nwas called the _Equator_ (ἰσημέρινος). {131} The two circles\r\nparallel to this which bounded the sun's path among the stars were\r\ncalled _Tropics_ (τροπικαί), because the sun _turns_ back again\r\ntowards the equator when he reaches them. The stars which never set\r\nare bounded by a circle called the _Arctic Circle_ (ἄρκτικος, from\r\nἄρκτος, the Bear, the constellation to which some of the principal\r\nstars within that circle belong.) A circle about the opposite pole\r\nis called _Antarctic_, and the stars which are within it can never\r\nrise to us.[41\\3] The sun's path or circle of the signs is called\r\nthe _Zodiac_, or circle of animals; the points where this circle\r\nmeets the equator are the _Equinoctial Points_, the days and nights\r\nbeing equal when the sun is in them; the _Solstitial Points_ are\r\nthose where the sun's path touches the tropics; his motion to the\r\nsouth or to the north ceases when he is there, and he appears in\r\nthat respect to stand still. The _Colures_ (κόλουροι, mutilated) are\r\ncircles which pass through the poles and through the equinoctial and\r\nsolstitial points; they have their name because they are only\r\nvisible in part, a portion of them being below the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\3: The Arctic and Antarctic Circles of modern astronomers\r\nare different from these.]\r\n\r\nThe _Horizon_ (ὁρίζων) is commonly understood as the boundary of the\r\nvisible earth and heaven. In the doctrine of the sphere, this\r\nboundary is _a great circle_, that is, a circle of which the plane\r\npasses through the centre of the sphere; and, therefore, an entire\r\nhemisphere is always above the horizon. The term occurs for the\r\nfirst time in the work of Euclid, called _Phænomena_ (Φαινόμενα). We\r\npossess two treatises written by Autolycus[42\\3] (who lived about\r\n300 B. C.) which trace _deductively_ the results of the doctrine of\r\nthe sphere. Supposing its diurnal motion to be uniform, in a work\r\nentitled Περὶ Κινουμένης Σφαῖρας, \"On the Moving Sphere,\" he\r\ndemonstrates various properties of the diurnal risings, settings,\r\nand motions of the stars. In another work, Περὶ Ἐπιτολῶν καὶ Δύσεων,\r\n\"On Risings and Settings,\"[43\\3] _tacitly_ assuming the sun's motion\r\nin his circle to be uniform, he proves certain propositions, with\r\nregard to those risings and settings of the stars, which take place\r\nat the same time when the sun rises and sets,[44\\3] or _vice\r\nversâ_;[45\\3] and also their _apparent_ risings and settings when\r\nthey cease to be visible after sunset, or begin to be visible after\r\nsunrise.[46\\3] {132} Several of the propositions contained in the\r\nformer of these treatises are still necessary to be understood, as\r\nfundamental parts of astronomy.\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\3: Delambre, _Astron. Ancienne_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\3: Delambre, _Astron. Anc._ p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\3: _Cosmical_ rising and setting.]\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\3: _Acronycal_ rising and setting; (ἀκρονυκίος, happening\r\nat the extremity of the night.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\3: _Heliacal_ rising and setting.]\r\n\r\nThe work of Euclid, just mentioned, is of the same kind.\r\nDelambre[47\\3] finds in it evidence that Euclid was merely a\r\nbook-astronomer, who had never observed the heavens.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\3: _Ast. Anc._ p. 53.]\r\n\r\nWe may here remark the first instance of that which we shall find\r\nabundantly illustrated in every part of the history of science; that\r\nman is _prone_ to become a deductive reasoner;--that as soon as he\r\nobtains principles which can be traced to details by logical\r\nconsequence, he sets about forming a body of science, by making a\r\nsystem of such reasonings. Geometry has always been a favorite mode\r\nof exercising this propensity: and that science, along with\r\nTrigonometry, Plane and Spherical, to which the early problems of\r\nastronomy gave rise, have, up to the present day, been a constant\r\nfield for the exercise of mathematical ingenuity; a few simple\r\nastronomical truths being assumed as the basis of the reasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 9.--_The Globular Form of the Earth._\r\n\r\nTHE establishment of the globular form of the earth is an important\r\nstep in astronomy, for it is the first of those convictions,\r\ndirectly opposed to the apparent evidence of the senses, which\r\nastronomy irresistibly proves. To make men believe that _up_ and\r\n_down_ are different directions in different places; that the sea,\r\nwhich seems so level, is, in fact, convex; that the earth, which\r\nappears to rest on a solid foundation, is, in fact, not supported at\r\nall; are great triumphs both of the power of discovering and the\r\npower of convincing. We may readily allow this, when we recollect\r\nhow recently the doctrine of the _antipodes_, or the existence of\r\ninhabitants of the earth, who stand on the opposite side of it, with\r\ntheir feet turned towards ours, was considered both monstrous and\r\nheretical.\r\n\r\nYet the different positions of the horizon at different places,\r\nnecessarily led the student of spherical astronomy towards this\r\nnotion of the earth as a round body. Anaximander[48\\3] is said by\r\nsome to have held the earth to be globular, and to be detached or\r\nsuspended; he is also stated to have constructed a sphere, on which\r\nwere shown the extent of land and water. As, however, we do not know\r\nthe arguments upon which he maintained the earth's globular form, we\r\ncannot judge of the {133} value of his opinion; it may have been no\r\nbetter founded than a different opinion ascribed to him by Laertius,\r\nthat the earth had the shape of a pillar. Probably, the authors of\r\nthe doctrine of the globular form of the earth were led to it, as we\r\nhave said, by observing the different height of the pole at\r\ndifferent places. They would find that the space which they passed\r\nover from north to south on the earth, was proportional to the\r\nchange of place of the horizon in the celestial sphere; and as the\r\nhorizon is, at every place, in the direction of the earth's\r\napparently level surface, this observation would naturally suggest\r\nto them the opinion that the earth is placed within the celestial\r\nsphere, as a small globe in the middle of a much larger one.\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\3: See Brucker, _Hist. Phil._ vol. i. p. 486.]\r\n\r\nWe find this doctrine so distinctly insisted on by Aristotle, that we\r\nmay almost look on him as the establisher of it.[49\\3] \"As to the\r\nfigure of the earth, it must necessarily be spherical.\" This he\r\nproves, first by the tendency of things, in all places, downwards. He\r\nthen adds,[50\\3] \"And, moreover, from the phenomena according to the\r\nsense: for if it were not so, the eclipses of the moon would not have\r\nsuch sections as they have. For in the configurations in the course of\r\na month, the deficient part takes all different shapes; it is\r\nstraight, and concave, and convex; but in eclipses it always has the\r\nline of division convex; wherefore, since the moon is eclipsed in\r\nconsequence of the interposition of the earth, the periphery of the\r\nearth must be the cause of this by having a spherical form. And again,\r\nfrom the appearances of the stars, it is clear, not only that the\r\nearth is round, but that its size is not very large: for when we make\r\na small removal to the south or the north, the circle of the horizon\r\nbecomes palpably different, so that the stars overhead undergo a great\r\nchange, and are not the same to those that travel to the north and to\r\nthe south. For some stars are seen in Egypt or at Cyprus, but are not\r\nseen in the countries to the north of these; and the stars that in the\r\nnorth are visible while they make a complete circuit, there undergo a\r\nsetting. So that from this it is manifest, not only that the form of\r\nthe earth is round, but also that it is a part of not a very large\r\nsphere: for otherwise the difference would not be so obvious to\r\npersons making so small a change of place. Wherefore we may judge that\r\nthose persons _who connect the region in the neighborhood of the\r\npillars of Hercules with that towards India, and who assert that in\r\nthis way the sea is_ ONE, do not assert things very improbable. They\r\nconfirm this conjecture moreover by the {134} elephants, which are\r\nsaid to be of the same species (γένος) towards each extreme; as if\r\nthis circumstance was a consequence of the conjunction of the\r\nextremes. The mathematicians, who try to calculate the measure of the\r\ncircumference, make it amount to 400,000 stadia; whence we collect\r\nthat the earth is not only spherical, but is not large compared with\r\nthe magnitude of the other stars.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\3: Arist. _de Cœlo_, lib. ii. cap. xiv. ed. Casaub. p.\r\n290.]\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\3: p. 291 C.]\r\n\r\nWhen this notion was once suggested, it was defended and confirmed\r\nby such arguments as we find in later writers: for instance,[51\\3]\r\nthat the tendency of all things was to fall to the place of heavy\r\nbodies, and that this place being the centre of the earth, the whole\r\nearth had no such tendency; that the inequalities on the surface\r\nwere so small as not materially to affect the shape of so vast a\r\nmass; that drops of water naturally form themselves into figures\r\nwith a convex surface; that the end of the ocean would fall if it\r\nwere not rounded off; that we see ships, when they go out to sea,\r\ndisappearing downwards, which shows the surface to be convex. These\r\nare the arguments still employed in impressing the doctrines of\r\nastronomy upon the student of our own days; and thus we find that,\r\neven at the early period of which we are now speaking, truths had\r\nbegun to accumulate which form a part of our present treasures.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\3: Pliny, _Nat. Hist._ ii. LXV.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 10.--_The Phases of the Moon._\r\n\r\nWHEN men had formed a steady notion of the Moon as a solid body,\r\nrevolving about the earth, they had only further to conceive it\r\nspherical, and to suppose the sun to be beyond the region of the\r\nmoon, and they would find that they had obtained an explanation of\r\nthe varying forms which the bright part of the moon assumes in the\r\ncourse of a month. For the convex side of the crescent-moon, and her\r\nfull edge when she is gibbous, are always turned towards the sun.\r\nAnd this explanation, once suggested, would be confirmed, the more\r\nit was examined. For instance, if there be near us a spherical\r\nstone, on which the sun is shining, and if we place ourselves so\r\nthat this stone and the moon are seen in the same direction (the\r\nmoon appearing just over the top of the stone), we shall find that\r\nthe visible part of the stone, which is then illuminated by the sun,\r\nis exactly similar in form to the moon, at whatever period of her\r\nchanges she may be. The stone and the moon being in the same\r\nposition with respect to us, and both being enlightened by the sun,\r\nthe bright parts are the same in figure; {135} the only difference\r\nis, that the dark part of the moon is usually not visible at all.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is ascribed to Anaximander. Aristotle was fully aware\r\nof it.[52\\3] It could not well escape the Chaldeans and Egyptians,\r\nif they speculated at all about the causes of the appearances in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\3: Probl. Cap. XV. Art. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 11.--_Eclipses._\r\n\r\nECLIPSES of the sun and moon were from the earliest tunes regarded\r\nwith a peculiar interest. The notions of superhuman influences and\r\nrelations, which, as we have seen, were associated with the\r\nluminaries of the sky, made men look with alarm at any sudden and\r\nstriking change in those objects; and as the constant and steady\r\ncourse of the celestial revolutions was contemplated with a feeling\r\nof admiration and awe, any marked interruption and deviation in this\r\ncourse, was regarded with surprise and terror. This appears to be\r\nthe case with all nations at an early stage of their civilization.\r\n\r\nThis impression would cause Eclipses to be noted and remembered; and\r\naccordingly we find that the records of Eclipses are the earliest\r\nastronomical information which we possess. When men had discovered\r\nsome of the laws of succession of other astronomical phenomena, for\r\ninstance, of the usual appearances of the moon and sun, it might\r\nthen occur to them that these unusual appearances also might\r\nprobably be governed by some rule.\r\n\r\nThe search after this rule was successful at an early period. The\r\nChaldeans were able to predict Eclipses of the Moon. This they did,\r\nprobably, by means of their Cycle of 223 months, or about 18 years;\r\nfor at the end of this time, the eclipses of the moon begin to return,\r\nat the same intervals and in the same order as at the beginning.[53\\3]\r\nProbably this was the first instance of the prediction of peculiar\r\nastronomical phenomena. The Chinese have, indeed, a legend, in which\r\nit is related that a solar eclipse happened in the reign of\r\nTchongkang, above 2000 years before Christ, and that the emperor was\r\nso much irritated against two great officers of state, who had\r\nneglected to predict this eclipse, that he put them to death. But this\r\ncannot be accepted as a real event: for, during the next ten\r\ncenturies, we find no single observation or fact connected with\r\nastronomy in the Chinese {136} histories; and their astronomy has\r\nnever advanced beyond a very rude and imperfect condition.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\3: The eclipses of the sun are more difficult to calculate;\r\nsince they depend upon the place of the spectator on the earth.]\r\n\r\nWe can only conjecture the mode in which the Chaldeans discovered\r\ntheir Period of 18 years; and we may make very different\r\nsuppositions with regard to the degree of science by which they were\r\nled to it. We may suppose, with Delambre,[54\\3] that they carefully\r\nrecorded the eclipses which happened, and then, by the inspection of\r\ntheir registers, discovered that those of the moon recurred after a\r\ncertain period. Or we may suppose, with other authors, that they\r\nsedulously determined the motions of the moon, and having obtained\r\nthese with considerable accuracy, sought and found a period which\r\nshould include cycles of these motions. This latter mode of\r\nproceeding would imply a considerable degree of knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\3: _A. A._ p. 212.]\r\n\r\nIt appears probable rather that such a period was discovered by\r\nnoticing the _recurrence_ of eclipses, than by studying the moon's\r\n_motions_. After 6585⅓ days, or 223 lunations, the same eclipses\r\nnearly will recur. It is not contested that the Chaldeans were\r\nacquainted with this period, which they called _Saros_; or that they\r\ncalculated eclipses by means of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 12.--_Sequel to the Early Stages of Astronomy._\r\n\r\nEVERY stage of science has its train of practical applications and\r\nsystematic inferences, arising both from the demands of convenience\r\nand curiosity, and from the pleasure which, as we have already said,\r\ningenuous and active-minded men feel in exercising the process of\r\ndeduction. The earliest condition of astronomy, in which it can be\r\nlooked upon as a science, exhibits several examples of such\r\napplications and inferences, of which we may mention a few.\r\n\r\n_Prediction of Eclipses._--The Cycles which served to keep in order\r\nthe Calendar of the early nations of antiquity, in some instances\r\nenabled them also, as has just been stated, to predict Eclipses; and\r\nthis application of knowledge necessarily excited great notice.\r\nCleomedes, in the time of Augustus, says, \"We never see an eclipse\r\nhappen which has not been predicted by those who made use of the\r\nTables.\" (ὑπὸ τῶν κανονικῶν.)\r\n\r\n_Terrestrial Zones._--The globular form of the earth being assented\r\nto, the doctrine of the sphere was applied to the earth as well as\r\nthe heavens; and the earth's surface was divided by various\r\nimaginary {137} circles; among the rest, the equator, the tropics,\r\nand circles, at the same distance from the poles as the tropics are\r\nfrom the equator. One of the curious consequences of this division\r\nwas the _assumption_ that there must be some marked difference in\r\nthe stripes or _zones_ into which the earth's surface was thus\r\ndivided. In going to the south, Europeans found countries hotter and\r\nhotter, in going to the north, colder and colder; and it was\r\nsupposed that the space between the tropical circles must be\r\nuninhabitable from heat, and that within the polar circles, again,\r\nuninhabitable from cold. This fancy was, as we now know, entirely\r\nunfounded. But the principle of the globular form of the earth, when\r\ndealt with by means of spherical geometry, led to many true and\r\nimportant propositions concerning the lengths of days and nights at\r\ndifferent places. These propositions still form a part of our\r\nElementary Astronomy.\r\n\r\n_Gnomonic._--Another important result of the doctrine of the sphere\r\nwas _Gnomonic_ or _Dialling_. Anaximenes is said by Pliny to have\r\nfirst taught this art in Greece; and both he and Anaximander are\r\nreported to have erected the first dial at Lacedemon. Many of the\r\nancient dials remain to us; some of these are of complex forms, and\r\nmust have required great ingenuity and considerable geometrical\r\nknowledge in their construction.\r\n\r\n_Measure of the Sun's Distance._--The explanation of the phases of the\r\nmoon led to no result so remarkable as the attempt of Aristarchus of\r\nSamos to obtain from this doctrine a measure of the Distance of the\r\nSun as compared with that of the Moon. If the moon was a perfectly\r\nsmooth sphere, when she was exactly midway between the new and full in\r\nposition (that is, a quadrant from the sun), she would be somewhat\r\nmore than a half moon; and the place when she was _dichotomized_, that\r\nis, was an exact semicircle, the bright part being bounded by a\r\nstraight line, would depend upon the sun's distance from the earth.\r\nAristarchus endeavored to fix the exact place of this Dichotomy; but\r\nthe irregularity of the edge which bounds the bright part of the moon,\r\nand the difficulty of measuring with accuracy, by means then in use,\r\neither the precise time when the boundary was most nearly a straight\r\nline, or the exact distance of the moon from the sun at that time,\r\nrendered his conclusion false and valueless. He collected that the sun\r\nis at 18 times the distance of the moon from us; we now know that he\r\nis at 400 times the moon's distance.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to dwell longer on subjects of this kind; but we\r\nhave already perhaps entered too much in detail. We have been {138}\r\ntempted to do this by the interest which the mathematical spirit of\r\nthe Greeks gave to the earliest astronomical discoveries, when these\r\nwere the subjects of their reasonings; but we must now proceed to\r\ncontemplate them engaged in a worthier employment, namely, in adding\r\nto these discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE INDUCTIVE EPOCH OF HIPPARCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHOUT pretending that we have exhausted the consequences of the\r\nelementary discoveries which we have enumerated, we now proceed to\r\nconsider the nature and circumstances of the next great discovery\r\nwhich makes an Epoch in the history of Astronomy; and this we shall\r\nfind to be the Theory of Epicycles and Eccentrics. Before, however,\r\nwe relate the establishment of this theory, we must, according to\r\nthe general plan we have marked out, notice some of the conjectures\r\nand attempts by which it was preceded, and the growing acquaintance\r\nwith facts, which made the want of such an explanation felt.\r\n\r\nIn the steps previously made in astronomical knowledge, no ingenuity\r\nhad been required to devise the view which was adopted. The motions of\r\nthe stars and sun were most naturally and almost irresistibly\r\nconceived as the results of motion in a revolving sphere; the\r\nindications of position which we obtain from different places on the\r\nearth's surface, when clearly combined, obviously imply a globular\r\nshape. In these cases, the first conjectures, the supposition of the\r\nsimplest form, of the most uniform motion, required no\r\nafter-correction. But this manifest simplicity, this easy and obvious\r\nexplanation, did not apply to the movement of all the heavenly bodies.\r\nThe Planets, the \"wandering stars,\" could not be so easily understood;\r\nthe motion of each, as Cicero says, \"undergoing very remarkable\r\nchanges in its course, going before and behind, quicker and slower,\r\nappearing in the evening, but gradually lost there, and emerging again\r\nin the morning.\"[55\\3] A continued attention to these stars would,\r\nhowever, {139} detect a kind of intricate regularity in their motions,\r\nwhich might naturally be described as \"a dance.\" The Chaldeans are\r\nstated by Diodorus[56\\3] to have observed assiduously the risings and\r\nsettings of the planets, from the top of the temple of Belus. By doing\r\nthis, they would find the times in which the forward and backward\r\nmovements of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars recur; and also the time in\r\nwhich they come round to the same part of the heavens.[57\\3] Venus and\r\nMercury never recede far from the sun, and the intervals which elapse\r\nwhile either of them leaves its greatest distance from the sun and\r\nreturns again to the greatest distance on the same side, would easily\r\nbe observed.\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\3: Cic. _de Nat. D._ lib. ii. p. 450. \"Ea quæ Saturni\r\nstella dicitur, φαίνωνque a Græcis nominatur, quæ a terra abest\r\nplurimum, xxx fere annis cursum suum conficit; in quo cursu multa\r\nmirabiliter efficiens, tum antecedendo, tum retardando, tum\r\nvespertinis temporibus delitescendo, tum matutinis se rursum\r\naperiendo, nihil immutat sempiternis sæculorum ætatibus, quin eadem\r\niisdem temporibus efficiat.\" And so of the other planets.]\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\3: _A. A._ i. p. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\3: Plin. _H. N._ ii. p. 204.]\r\n\r\nProbably the manner in which the motions of the planets were\r\noriginally reduced to rule was something like the following:--In\r\nabout 30 of our years, Saturn goes 29 times through his _Anomaly_,\r\nthat is, the succession of varied motions by which he sometimes goes\r\nforwards and sometimes backwards among the stars. During this time,\r\nhe goes once round the heavens, and returns nearly to the same\r\nplace. This is the cycle of his apparent motions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the eastern nations contented themselves with thus referring\r\nthese motions to cycles of time, so as to determine their recurrence.\r\nSomething of this kind was done at an early period, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nBut the Greeks soon attempted to frame to themselves a sensible image\r\nof the mechanism by which these complex motions were produced; nor did\r\nthey find this difficult. Venus, for instance, who, upon the whole,\r\nmoves from west to east among the stars, is seen, at certain\r\nintervals, to return or move _retrograde_ a short way back from east\r\nto west, then to become for a short time _stationary_, then to turn\r\nagain and resume her _direct_ motion westward, and so on. Now this can\r\nbe explained by supposing that she is placed in the rim of a wheel,\r\nwhich is turned edgeways to us, and of which the centre turns round in\r\nthe heavens from west to east, while the wheel, carrying the planet in\r\nits motion, moves round its own centre. In this way the motion of the\r\nwheel about its centre, would, in some situations, counterbalance the\r\ngeneral motion of the centre, and make the planet retrograde, while,\r\non the whole, the westerly motion would prevail. Just as if we suppose\r\nthat a person, holding a lamp in his hand in the dark, and at a {140}\r\ndistance, so that the lamp alone is visible, should run on turning\r\nhimself round; we should see the light sometimes stationary, sometimes\r\nretrograde, but on the whole progressive.\r\n\r\nA mechanism of this kind was imagined for each of the planets, and the\r\nwheels of which we have spoken were in the end called _Epicycles_.\r\n\r\nThe application of such mechanism to the planets appears to have\r\narisen in Greece about the time of Aristotle. In the works of Plato we\r\nfind a strong taste for this kind of mechanical speculation. In the\r\ntenth book of the \"Polity,\" we have the apologue of Alcinus the\r\nPamphylian, who, being supposed to be killed in battle, revived when\r\nhe was placed on the funeral pyre, and related what he had seen during\r\nhis trance. Among other revelations, he beheld the machinery by which\r\nall the celestial bodies revolve. The axis of these revolutions is the\r\nadamantine distaff which Destiny holds between her knees; on this are\r\nfixed, by means of different sockets, flat rings, by which the planets\r\nare carried. The order and magnitude of these spindles are minutely\r\ndetailed. Also, in the \"Epilogue to the Laws\" (_Epinomis_), he again\r\ndescribes the various movements of the sky, so as to show a distinct\r\nacquaintance with the general character of the planetary motions; and,\r\nafter speaking of the Egyptians and Syrians as the original\r\ncultivators of such knowledge, he adds some very remarkable\r\nexhortations to his countrymen to prosecute the subject. \"Whatever we\r\nGreeks,\" he says, \"receive from the barbarians, we improve and\r\nperfect; there is good hope and promise, therefore, that Greeks will\r\ncarry this knowledge far beyond that which was introduced from\r\nabroad.\" To this task, however, he looks with a due appreciation of\r\nthe qualities and preparation which it requires. \"An astronomer must\r\nbe,\" he says, \"the wisest of men; his mind must be duly disciplined in\r\nyouth; especially is mathematical study necessary; both an\r\nacquaintance with the doctrine of number, and also with that other\r\nbranch of mathematics, which, closely connected as it is with the\r\nscience of the _heavens_, we very absurdly call _geometry_, the\r\nmeasurement of the _earth_.\"[58\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\3: _Epinomis_, pp. 988, 990.]\r\n\r\nThose anticipations were very remarkably verified in the subsequent\r\ncareer of the Greek Astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe theory, once suggested, probably made rapid progress.\r\nSimplicius[59\\3] relates, that Eudoxus of Cnidus introduced the\r\nhypothesis of revolving circles or spheres. Calippus of Cyzicus,\r\nhaving visited {141} Polemarchus, an intimate friend of Eudoxus,\r\nthey went together to Athens, and communicated to Aristotle the\r\ninvention of Eudoxus, and with his help improved and corrected it.\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\3: Lib. ii. _de Cœlo_. Bullialdus, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nProbably at first this hypothesis was applied only to account for\r\nthe general phenomena of the progressions, retrogradations, and\r\nstations of the planet; but it was soon found that the motions of\r\nthe sun and moon, and the circular motions of the planets, which the\r\nhypothesis supposed, had other _anomalies_ or irregularities, which\r\nmade a further extension of the hypothesis necessary.\r\n\r\nThe defect of uniformity in these motions of the sun and moon,\r\nthough less apparent than in the planets, is easily detected, as\r\nsoon as men endeavor to obtain any accuracy in their observations.\r\nWe have already stated (Chap. I.) that the Chaldeans were in\r\npossession of a period of about eighteen years, which they used in\r\nthe calculation of eclipses, and which might have been discovered by\r\nclose observation of the moon's motions; although it was probably\r\nrather hit upon by noting the recurrence of eclipses. The moon moves\r\nin a manner which is not reducible to regularity without\r\nconsiderable care and time. If we trace her path among the stars, we\r\nfind that, like the path of the sun, it is oblique to the equator,\r\nbut it does not, like that of the sun, pass over the same stars in\r\nsuccessive revolutions. Thus its _latitude_, or distance from the\r\nequator, has a cycle different from its revolution among the stars;\r\nand its _Nodes_, or the points where it cuts the equator, are\r\nperpetually changing their position. In addition to this, the moon's\r\nmotion in her own path is not uniform; in the course of each\r\nlunation, she moves alternately slower and quicker, passing\r\ngradually through the intermediate degrees of velocity; and goes\r\nthrough the cycle of these changes in something less than a month;\r\nthis is called a revolution of _Anomaly_. When the moon has gone\r\nthrough a complete number of revolutions of Anomaly, and has, in the\r\nsame time, returned to the same position with regard to the sun, and\r\nalso with regard to her Nodes, her motions with respect to the sun\r\nwill thenceforth be the same as at the first, and all the\r\ncircumstances on which lunar eclipses depend being the same, the\r\neclipses will occur in the same order. In 6585⅓ days there are 239\r\nrevolutions of anomaly, 241 revolutions with regard to one of the\r\nNodes, and, as we have said, 223 lunations or revolutions with\r\nregard to the sun. Hence this Period will bring about a succession\r\nof the same lunar eclipses.\r\n\r\nIf the Chaldeans observed the moon's motion among the stars with any\r\nconsiderable accuracy, so as to detect this period by that means,\r\n{142} they could hardly avoid discovering the anomaly or unequal\r\nmotion of the moon; for in every revolution, her daily progression\r\nin the heavens varies from about twenty-two to twenty-six times her\r\nown diameter. But there is not, in their knowledge of this Period,\r\nany evidence that they had measured the amount of this variation;\r\nand Delambre[60\\3] is probably right in attributing all such\r\nobservations to the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\3: _Astronomie Ancienne_, i. 212.]\r\n\r\nThe sun's motion would also be seen to be irregular as soon as men\r\nhad any exact mode of determining the lengths of the four seasons,\r\nby means of the passage of the sun through the equinoctial and\r\nsolstitial points. For spring, summer, autumn, and winter, which\r\nwould each consist of an equal number of days if the motions were\r\nuniform, are, in fact, found to be unequal in length.\r\n\r\nIt was not very difficult to see that the mechanism of epicycles\r\nmight be applied so as to explain irregularities of this kind. A\r\nwheel travelling round the earth, while it revolved upon its centre,\r\nmight produce the effect of making the sun or moon fixed in its rim\r\ngo sometimes faster and sometimes slower in appearance, just in the\r\nsame way as the same suppositions would account for a planet going\r\nsometimes forwards and sometimes backwards: the epicycles of the sun\r\nand moon would, for this purpose, be less than those of the planets.\r\nAccordingly, it is probable that, at the time of Plato and\r\nAristotle, philosophers were already endeavoring to apply the\r\nhypothesis to these cases, though it does not appear that any one\r\nfully succeeded before Hipparchus.\r\n\r\nThe problem which was thus present to the minds of astronomers, and\r\nwhich Plato is said to have proposed to them in a distinct form,\r\nwas, \"To reconcile the celestial phenomena by the combination of\r\nequable circular motions.\" That the circular motions should be\r\nequable as well as circular, was a condition, which, if it had been\r\nmerely tried at first, as the most simple and definite conjecture,\r\nwould have deserved praise. But this condition, which is, in\r\nreality, inconsistent with nature, was, in the sequel, adhered to\r\nwith a pertinacity which introduced endless complexity into the\r\nsystem. The history of this assumption is one of the most marked\r\ninstances of that love of simplicity and symmetry which is the\r\nsource of all general truths, though it so often produces and\r\nperpetuates error. At present we can easily see how fancifully the\r\nnotion of simplicity and perfection was interpreted, in the\r\narguments by which the opinion was defended, that the {143} real\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies must be circular and uniform. The\r\nPythagoreans, as well as the Platonists, maintained this dogma.\r\nAccording to Geminus, \"They supposed the motions of the sun, and the\r\nmoon, and the five planets, to be circular and equable: for they\r\nwould not allow of such disorder among divine and eternal things, as\r\nthat they should sometimes move quicker, and sometimes slower, and\r\nsometimes stand still; for no one would tolerate such anomaly in the\r\nmovements, even of a man, who was decent and orderly. The occasions\r\nof life, however, are often reasons for men going quicker or slower,\r\nbut in the incorruptible nature of the stars, it is not possible\r\nthat any cause can be alleged of quickness and slowness. Whereupon\r\nthey propounded this question, how the phenomena might be\r\nrepresented by equable and circular motions.\"\r\n\r\nThese conjectures and assumptions led naturally to the establishment\r\nof the various parts of the Theory of Epicycles. It is probable that\r\nthis theory was adopted with respect to the Planets at or before the\r\ntime of Plato. And Aristotle gives us an account of the system thus\r\ndevised.[61\\3] \"Eudoxus,\" he says, \"attributed four spheres to each\r\nPlanet: the first revolved with the fixed stars (and this produced\r\nthe diurnal motion); the second gave the planet a motion along the\r\necliptic (the mean motion in longitude); the third had its axis\r\nperpendicular[62\\3] to the ecliptic (and this gave the inequality of\r\neach planetary motion, really arising from its special motion about\r\nthe sun); the fourth produced the oblique motion transverse to this\r\n(the motion in latitude).\" He is also said to have attributed a\r\nmotion in latitude and a corresponding sphere to the Sun as well as\r\nto the Moon, of which it is difficult to understand the meaning, if\r\nAristotle has reported rightly of the theory; for it would be absurd\r\nto ascribe to Eudoxus a knowledge of the motions by which the sun\r\ndeviates from the ecliptic. Calippus conceived that two additional\r\nspheres must be given to the sun and to the moon, in order to\r\nexplain the phenomena: probably he was aware of the inequalities of\r\nthe motions of these luminaries. He also proposed an additional\r\nsphere for each planet, to account, we may suppose, for the results\r\nof the eccentricity of the orbits.\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\3: Metaph. xi. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\3: Aristotle says \"has its poles in the ecliptic,\" but this\r\nmust be a mistake of his. He professes merely to receive these\r\nopinions from the mathematical astronomers, \"ἐκ τῆς οἰκειοτάτης\r\nφιλοσοφίας τῶν μαθηματικῶν.\"]\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis, in this form, does not appear to have been reduced\r\nto measure, and was, moreover, unnecessarily complex. The resolution\r\n{144} of the oblique motion of the moon into two separate motions,\r\nby Eudoxus, was not the simplest way of conceiving it; and Calippus\r\nimagined the connection of these spheres in some way which made it\r\nnecessary nearly to double their number; in this manner his system\r\nhad no less than 55 spheres.\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress which the _Idea_ of the hypothesis of\r\nepicycles had made in men's minds, previously to the establishment\r\nof the theory by Hipparchus. There had also been a preparation for\r\nthis step, on the other side, by the collection of _Facts_. We know\r\nthat observations of the Eclipses of the Moon were made by the\r\nChaldeans 367 B. C. at Babylon, and were known to the Greeks; for\r\nHipparchus and Ptolemy founded their Theory of the Moon on these\r\nobservations. Perhaps we cannot consider, as equally certain, the\r\nstory that, at the time of Alexander's conquest, the Chaldeans\r\npossessed a series of observations, which went back 1903 years, and\r\nwhich Aristotle caused Callisthenes to bring to him in Greece. All\r\nthe Greek observations which are of any value, begin with the school\r\nof Alexandria. Aristyllus and Timocharis appear, by the citations of\r\nHipparchus, to have observed the Places of Stars and Planets, and\r\nthe Times of the Solstices, at various periods from B. C. 295 to B.\r\nC. 269. Without their observations, indeed, it would not have been\r\neasy for Hipparchus to establish either the Theory of the Sun or the\r\nPrecession of the Equinoxes.\r\n\r\nIn order that observations at distant intervals may be compared with\r\neach other, they must be referred to some common era. The Chaldeans\r\ndated by the era of Nabonassar, which commenced 749 B. C. The Greek\r\nobservations were referred to the Calippic periods of 76 years, of\r\nwhich the first began 331 B. C. These are the dates used by\r\nHipparchus and Ptolemy. {145}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINDUCTIVE EPOCH OF HIPPARCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Establishment of the Theory of Epicycles and\r\nEccentrics._\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH, as we have already seen, at the time of Plato, the Idea of\r\nEpicycles had been suggested, and the problem of its general\r\napplication proposed, and solutions of this problem offered by his\r\nfollowers; we still consider Hipparchus as the real discoverer and\r\nfounder of that theory; inasmuch as he not only guessed that it\r\n_might_, but showed that it _must_, account for the phenomena, both\r\nas to their nature and as to their quantity. The assertion that \"he\r\nonly discovers who proves,\" is just; not only because, until a\r\ntheory is proved to be the true one, it has no pre-eminence over the\r\nnumerous other guesses among which it circulates, and above which\r\nthe proof alone elevates it; but also because he who takes hold of\r\nthe theory so as to apply calculation to it, possesses it with a\r\ndistinctness of conception which makes it peculiarly his.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish the Theory of Epicycles, it was necessary to\r\nassign the magnitudes, distances, and positions of the circles or\r\nspheres in which the heavenly bodies were moved, in such a manner as\r\nto account for their apparently irregular motions. We may best\r\nunderstand what was the problem to be solved, by calling to mind\r\nwhat we now know to be the real motions of the heavens. The true\r\nmotion of the earth round the sun, and therefore the apparent annual\r\nmotion of the sun, is performed, not in a circle of which the earth\r\nis the centre, but in an ellipse or oval, the earth being nearer to\r\none end than to the other; and the motion is most rapid when the sun\r\nis at the nearer end of this oval. But instead of an oval, we may\r\nsuppose the sun to move uniformly in a circle, the earth being now,\r\nnot in the centre, but nearer to one side; for on this supposition,\r\nthe sun will appear to move most quickly when he is nearest to the\r\nearth, or in his _Perigee_, as that point is called. Such an orbit\r\nis called an _Eccentric_, and the distance of the earth from the\r\ncentre of the circle is called the _Eccentricity_. It may easily be\r\nshown by geometrical reasoning, that the inequality of apparent\r\nmotion so produced, is exactly the same in {146} detail, as the\r\ninequality which follows from the hypothesis of a small _Epicycle_,\r\nturning uniformly on its axis, and carrying the sun in its\r\ncircumference, while the centre of this epicycle moves uniformly in\r\na circle of which the earth is the centre. This identity of the\r\nresults of the hypothesis of the Eccentric and the Epicycle is\r\nproved by Ptolemy in the third book of the \"Almagest.\"\r\n\r\n_The Sun's Eccentric._--When Hipparchus had clearly conceived these\r\nhypotheses, as _possible_ ways of accounting for the sun's motion,\r\nthe task which he had to perform, in order to show that they\r\ndeserved to be adopted, was to assign a place to the _Perigee_, a\r\nmagnitude to the _Eccentricity_, and an _Epoch_ at which the sun was\r\nat the perigee; and to show that, in this way, he had produced a\r\ntrue representation of the motions of the sun. This, accordingly, he\r\ndid; and having thus determined, with considerable exactness, both\r\nthe law of the solar irregularities, and the numbers on which their\r\namount depends, he was able to assign the motions and places of the\r\nsun for any moment of future time with corresponding exactness; he\r\nwas able, in short, to construct _Solar Tables_, by means of which\r\nthe sun's place with respect to the stars could be correctly found\r\nat any time. These tables (as they are given by Ptolemy)[63\\3] give\r\nthe _Anomaly_, or inequality of the sun's motion; and this they\r\nexhibit by means of the _Prosthapheresis_, the quantity of which, at\r\nany distance of the sun from the _Apogee_, it is requisite to add to\r\nor subtract from the arc, which he would have described if his\r\nmotion had been equable.\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\3: Syntax. 1. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe reader might perhaps expect that the calculations which thus\r\nexhibited the motions of the sun for an indefinite future period\r\nmust depend upon a considerable number of observations made at all\r\nseasons of the year. That, however, was not the case; and the genius\r\nof the discoverer appeared, as such genius usually does appear, in\r\nhis perceiving how small a number of facts, rightly considered, were\r\nsufficient to form a foundation for the theory. The number of days\r\ncontained in two seasons of the year sufficed for this purpose to\r\nHipparchus. \"Having ascertained,\" says Ptolemy, \"that the time from\r\nthe vernal equinox to the summer tropic is 94½ days, and the time\r\nfrom the summer tropic to the autumnal equinox 92½ days, from these\r\nphenomena alone he demonstrates that the straight line joining the\r\ncentre of the sun's eccentric path with the centre of the zodiac\r\n(the spectator's eye) is nearly the 24th part of the radius of the\r\neccentric path; and that {147} its _apogee_ precedes the summer\r\nsolstice by 24½ degrees nearly, the zodiac containing 360.\"\r\n\r\nThe exactness of the Solar Tables, or _Canon_, which was founded on\r\nthese data, was manifested, not only by the coincidence of the sun's\r\ncalculated place with such observations as the Greek astronomers of\r\nthis period were able to make (which were indeed very rude), but by\r\nits enabling them to calculate solar and lunar eclipses; phenomena\r\nwhich are a very precise and severe trial of the accuracy of such\r\ntables, inasmuch as a very minute change in the apparent place of\r\nthe sun or moon would completely alter the obvious features of the\r\neclipse. Though the tables of this period were by no means perfect,\r\nthey bore with tolerable credit this trying and perpetually\r\nrecurring test; and thus proved the soundness of the theory on which\r\nthe tables were calculated.\r\n\r\n_The Moon's Eccentric._--The moon's motions have many\r\nirregularities; but when the hypothesis of an Eccentric or an\r\nEpicycle had sufficed in the case of the sun, it was natural to try\r\nto explain, in the same way, the motions of the moon; and it was\r\nshown by Hipparchus that such hypotheses would account for the more\r\nobvious anomalies. It is not very easy to describe the several ways\r\nin which these hypotheses were applied, for it is, in truth, very\r\ndifficult to explain in words even the mere facts of the moon's\r\nmotion. If she were to leave a visible bright line behind her in the\r\nheavens wherever she moved, the path thus exhibited would be of an\r\nextremely complex nature; the circle of each revolution slipping\r\naway from the preceding, and the traces of successive revolutions\r\nforming a sort of band of net-work running round the middle of the\r\nsky.[64\\3] In each revolution, the motion in longitude is affected\r\nby an anomaly of the same nature as the sun's anomaly already spoken\r\nof; but besides this, the path of the moon deviates from the\r\necliptic to the north and to the south of the ecliptic, and thus she\r\nhas a motion in latitude. This motion in latitude would be\r\nsufficiently known if we knew the period of its _restoration_, that\r\nis, the time which the moon occupies in moving from any latitude\r\ntill she is restored to the same latitude; as, for instance, from\r\nthe ecliptic on one side of the heavens to the ecliptic on the same\r\nside of the heavens again. But it is found that the period of the\r\nrestoration of the latitude is not the same as the period of the\r\nrestoration of the longitude, that is, as the period of the moon's\r\nrevolution among the {148} stars; and thus the moon describes a\r\ndifferent path among the stars in every successive revolution, and\r\nher path, as well as her velocity, is constantly variable.\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\3: The reader will find an attempt to make the nature of\r\nthis path generally intelligible in the _Companion to the British\r\nAlmanac_ for 1814.]\r\n\r\nHipparchus, however, reduced the motions of the moon to rule and to\r\nTables, as he did those of the sun, and in the same manner. He\r\ndetermined, with much greater accuracy than any preceding\r\nastronomer, the mean or average equable motions of the moon in\r\nlongitude and in latitude; and he then represented the anomaly of\r\nthe motion in longitude by means of an eccentric, in the same manner\r\nas he had done for the sun.\r\n\r\nBut here there occurred still an additional change, besides those of\r\nwhich we have spoken. The Apogee of the Sun was always in the same\r\nplace in the heavens; or at least so nearly so, that Ptolemy could\r\ndetect no error in the place assigned to it by Hipparchus 250 years\r\nbefore. But the Apogee of the Moon was found to have a motion among\r\nthe stars. It had been observed before the time of Hipparchus, that\r\nin 6585⅓ days, there are 241 revolutions of the moon with regard to\r\nthe stars, but only 239 revolutions with regard to the anomaly. This\r\ndifference could be suitably represented by supposing the eccentric,\r\nin which the moon moves, to have itself an angular motion,\r\nperpetually carrying its apogee in the same direction in which the\r\nmoon travels; but this supposition being made, it was necessary to\r\ndetermine, not only the eccentricity of the orbit, and place of the\r\napogee at a certain time, but also the rate of motion of the apogee\r\nitself, in order to form tables of the moon.\r\n\r\nThis task, as we have said, Hipparchus executed; and in this instance,\r\nas in the problem of the reduction of the sun's motion to tables, the\r\ndata which he found it necessary to employ were very few. He deduced\r\nall his conclusions from six eclipses of the moon.[65\\3] Three of\r\nthese, the records of which were brought from Babylon, where a\r\nregister of such occurrences was kept, happened in the 366th and 367th\r\nyears from the era of Nabonassar, and enabled Hipparchus to determine\r\nthe eccentricity and apogee of the moon's orbit at that time. The\r\nthree others were observed at Alexandria, in the 547th year of\r\nNabonassar, which gave him another position of the orbit at an\r\ninterval of 180 years; and he thus became acquainted with the motion\r\nof the orbit itself, as well as its form.[66\\3] {149}\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\3: Ptol. _Syn._ iv. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\3: Ptolemy uses the hypothesis of an epicycle for the\r\nmoon's first inequality; but Hipparchus employs an eccentric.]\r\n\r\nThe moon's motions are really affected by several other\r\ninequalities, of very considerable amount, besides those which were\r\nthus considered by Hipparchus; but the lunar paths, constructed on\r\nthe above data, possessed a considerable degree of correctness, and\r\nespecially when applied, as they were principally, to the\r\ncalculation of eclipses; for the greatest of the additional\r\nirregularities which we have mentioned disappear at new and full\r\nmoon, which are the only times when eclipses take place.\r\n\r\nThe numerical explanation of the motions of the sun and moon, by\r\nmeans of the Hypothesis of Eccentrics, and the consequent\r\nconstruction of tables, was one of the great achievements of\r\nHipparchus. The general explanation of the motions of the planets,\r\nby means of the hypothesis of epicycles, was in circulation\r\npreviously, as we have seen. But the special motions of the planets,\r\nin their epicycles, are, in reality, affected by anomalies of the\r\nsame kind as those which render it necessary to introduce eccentrics\r\nin the cases of the sun and moon.\r\n\r\nHipparchus determined, with great exactness, the _Mean Motions_ of\r\nthe Planets; but he was not able, from want of data, to explain the\r\nplanetary _Irregularities_ by means of Eccentrics. The whole mass of\r\ngood observations of the planets which he received from preceding\r\nages, did not contain so many, says Ptolemy, as those which he has\r\ntransmitted to us of his own. \"Hence[67\\3] it was,\" he adds, \"that\r\nwhile he labored, in the most assiduous manner to represent the\r\nmotions of the sun and moon by means of equable circular motions;\r\nwith respect to the planets, so far as his works show, he did not\r\neven make the attempt, but merely put the extant observations in\r\norder, added to them himself more than the whole of what he received\r\nfrom preceding ages, and showed the insufficiency of the hypothesis\r\ncurrent among astronomers to explain the phenomena.\" It appears that\r\npreceding mathematicians had already pretended to construct \"a\r\nPerpetual Canon,\" that is, Tables which should give the places of\r\nthe planets at any future time; but these being constructed without\r\nregard to the eccentricity of the orbits, must have been very\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\3: _Synt._ ix. 2.]\r\n\r\nPtolemy declares, with great reason, that Hipparchus showed his\r\nusual love of truth, and his right sense of the responsibility of\r\nhis task, in leaving this part of it to future ages. The Theories of\r\nthe Sun and Moon, which we have already described, constitute him a\r\ngreat astronomical discoverer, and justify the reputation he has\r\nalways {150} possessed. There is, indeed, no philosopher who is so\r\nuniformly spoken of in terms of admiration. Ptolemy, to whom we owe\r\nour principal knowledge of him, perpetually couples with his name\r\nepithets of praise: he is not only an excellent and careful\r\nobserver, but \"a[68\\3] most truth-loving and labor-loving person,\"\r\none who had shown extraordinary sagacity and remarkable desire of\r\ntruth in every part of science. Pliny, after mentioning him and\r\nThales, breaks out into one of his passages of declamatory\r\nvehemence: \"Great men! elevated above the common standard of human\r\nnature, by discovering the laws which celestial occurrences obey,\r\nand by freeing the wretched mind of man from the fears which\r\neclipses inspired--Hail to you and to your genius, interpreters of\r\nheaven, worthy recipients of the laws of the universe, authors of\r\nprinciples which connect gods and men!\" Modern writers have spoken\r\nof Hipparchus with the same admiration; and even the exact but\r\nsevere historian of astronomy, Delambre, who bestows his praise so\r\nsparingly, and his sarcasm so generally;--who says[69\\3] that it is\r\nunfortunate for the memory of Aristarchus that his work has come to\r\nus entire, and who cannot refer[70\\3] to the statement of an eclipse\r\nrightly predicted by Halicon of Cyzicus without adding, that if the\r\nstory be true, Halicon was more lucky than prudent;--loses all his\r\nbitterness when he comes to Hipparchus.[71\\3] \"In Hipparchus,\" says\r\nhe, \"we find one of the most extraordinary men of antiquity; the\r\n_very greatest_, in the sciences which require a combination of\r\nobservation with geometry.\" Delambre adds, apparently in the wish to\r\nreconcile this eulogium with the depreciating manner in which he\r\nhabitually speaks of all astronomers whose observations are inexact,\r\n\"a long period and the continued efforts of many industrious men are\r\nrequisite to produce good instruments, but energy and assiduity\r\ndepend on the man himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\3: _Synt._ ix. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\3: _Astronomie Ancienne_, i. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\3: Ib. i. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\3: Ib. i. 186.]\r\n\r\nHipparchus was the author of other great discoveries and\r\nimprovements in astronomy, besides the establishment of the Doctrine\r\nof Eccentrics and Epicycles; but this, being the greatest advance in\r\nthe _theory_ of the celestial motions which was made by the\r\nancients, must be the leading subject of our attention in the\r\npresent work; our object being to discover in what the progress of\r\nreal theoretical knowledge consists, and under what circumstances it\r\nhas gone on. {151}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Estimate of the Value of the Theory of Eccentrics and\r\nEpicycles._\r\n\r\nIT may be useful here to explain the value of the theoretical step\r\nwhich Hipparchus thus made; and the more so, as there are, perhaps,\r\nopinions in popular circulation, which might lead men to think\r\nlightly of the merit of introducing or establishing the Doctrine of\r\nEpicycles. For, in the first place, this doctrine is now\r\nacknowledged to be false; and some of the greatest men in the more\r\nmodern history of astronomy owe the brightest part of their fame to\r\ntheir having been instrumental in overturning this hypothesis. And,\r\nmoreover, in the next place, the theory is not only false, but\r\nextremely perplexed and entangled, so that it is usually looked upon\r\nas a mass of arbitrary and absurd complication. Most persons are\r\nfamiliar with passages in which it is thus spoken of.[72\\3]\r\n\r\n  . . . . .  He his fabric of the heavens\r\n  Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move\r\n  His laughter at their quaint opinions wide;\r\n  Hereafter, when they come to model heaven\r\n  And calculate the stars, how will they wield\r\n  The mighty frame! how build, unbuild, contrive,\r\n  To save appearances! how gird the sphere\r\n  With centric and eccentric scribbled o'er,\r\n  Cycle in epicycle, orb in orb!\r\n\r\nAnd every one will recollect the celebrated saying of Alphonso X.,\r\nking of Castile,[73\\3] when this complex system was explained to\r\nhim; that \"if God had consulted him at the creation, the universe\r\nshould have been on a better and simpler plan.\" In addition to this,\r\nthe system is represented as involving an extravagant conception of\r\nthe nature of the orbs which it introduces; that they are\r\ncrystalline spheres, and that the vast spaces which intervene\r\nbetween the celestial luminaries are a solid mass, formed by the\r\nfitting together of many masses perpetually in motion; an\r\nimagination which is presumed to be incredible and monstrous.\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\3: _Paradise Lost_, viii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\3: A. D. 1252.]\r\n\r\nWe must endeavor to correct or remove these prejudices, not only in\r\norder that we may do justice to the Hipparchian, or, as it is\r\nusually called, Ptolemaic system of astronomy, and to its founder;\r\nbut for another reason, much more important to the purpose of this\r\nwork; {152} namely, that we may see how theories may be highly\r\nestimable, though they contain false representations of the real\r\nstate of things, and may be extremely useful, though they involve\r\nunnecessary complexity. In the advance of knowledge, the value of\r\nthe true part of a theory may much outweigh the accompanying error,\r\nand the use of a rule may be little impaired by its want of\r\nsimplicity. The first steps of our progress do not lose their\r\nimportance because they are not the last; and the outset of the\r\njourney may require no less vigor and activity than its close.\r\n\r\nThat which is true in the Hipparchian theory, and which no\r\nsucceeding discoveries have deprived of its value, is the\r\n_Resolution_ of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies into an\r\nassemblage of circular motions. The test of the truth and reality of\r\nthis Resolution is, that it leads to the construction of theoretical\r\nTables of the motions of the luminaries, by which their places are\r\ngiven at any time, agreeing nearly with their places as actually\r\nobserved. The assumption that these circular motions, thus\r\nintroduced, are all exactly uniform, is the fundamental principle of\r\nthe whole process. This assumption is, it may be said, false; and we\r\nhave seen how fantastic some of the arguments were, which were\r\noriginally urged in its favor. But _some_ assumption is necessary,\r\nin order that the motions, at different points of a revolution, may\r\nbe somehow connected, that is, in order that we may have any theory\r\nof the motions; and no assumption more simple than the one now\r\nmentioned can be selected. The merit of the theory is this;--that\r\nobtaining the amount of the eccentricity, the place of the apogee,\r\nand, it may be, other elements, from _few_ observations, it deduces\r\nfrom these, results agreeing with _all_ observations, however\r\nnumerous and distant. To express an inequality by means of an\r\nepicycle, implies, not only that there is an inequality, but\r\nfurther,--that the inequality is at its greatest value at a certain\r\nknown place,--diminishes in proceeding from that place by a known\r\nlaw,--continues its diminution for a known portion of the revolution\r\nof the luminary,--then increases again; and so on: that is, the\r\nintroduction of the epicycle represents the inequality of motion, as\r\ncompletely as it can be represented with respect to its _quantity_.\r\n\r\nWe may further illustrate this, by remarking that such a Resolution\r\nof the unequal motions of the heavenly bodies into equable circular\r\nmotions, is, in fact, equivalent to the most recent and improved\r\nprocesses by which modern astronomers deal with such motions. Their\r\nuniversal method is to resolve all unequal motions into a series of\r\n{153} _terms_, or expressions of partial motions; and these terms\r\ninvolve _sines_ and _cosines_, that is, certain technical modes of\r\nmeasuring circular motion, the circular motion having some constant\r\nrelation to the time. And thus the problem of the resolution of the\r\ncelestial motions into equable circular ones, which was propounded\r\nabove two thousand years ago in the school of Plato, is still the\r\ngreat object of the study of modern astronomers, whether observers\r\nor calculators.\r\n\r\nThat Hipparchus should have succeeded in the first great steps of\r\nthis resolution for the sun and moon, and should have seen its\r\napplicability in other cases, is a circumstance which gives him one\r\nof the most distinguished places in the roll of great astronomers.\r\nAs to the charges or the sneers against the complexity of his\r\nsystem, to which we have referred, it is easy to see that they are\r\nof no force. As a system of _calculation_, his is not only good,\r\nbut, as we have just said, in many cases no better has yet been\r\ndiscovered. If, when the actual motions of the heavens are\r\ncalculated in the best possible way, the process is complex and\r\ndifficult, and if we are discontented at this, nature, and not the\r\nastronomer, must be the object of our displeasure. This plea of the\r\nastronomers must be allowed to be reasonable. \"We must not be\r\nrepelled,\" says Ptolemy,[74\\3] \"by the complexity of the hypotheses,\r\nbut explain the phenomena as well as we can. If the hypotheses\r\nsatisfy each apparent inequality separately, the combination of them\r\nwill represent the truth; and why should it appear wonderful to any\r\nthat such a complexity should exist in the heavens, when we know\r\nnothing of their nature which entitles us to suppose that any\r\ninconsistency will result?\"\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\3: _Synt._ xiii. 2.]\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, we now know that the motions are more simple\r\nthan they were thus represented, and that the Theory of Epicycles\r\nwas false, as a conception of the real construction of the heavens.\r\nAnd to this we may reply, that it does not appear that the best\r\nastronomers of antiquity conceived the cycles and epicycles to have\r\na material existence. Though the dogmatic philosophers, as the\r\nAristotelians, appear to have taught that the celestial spheres were\r\nreal solid bodies, they are spoken of by Ptolemy as imaginary;[75\\3]\r\nand it is clear, from his proof of the identity of the results of\r\nthe hypothesis of an eccentric and an epicycle, that they are\r\nintended to pass for no more than geometrical conceptions, in which\r\nview they are true representations of the apparent motions. {154}\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\3: Ibid. iii. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the real motions of the heavenly bodies are simpler\r\nthan the apparent motions; and that we, who are in the habit of\r\nrepresenting to our minds their real arrangement, become impatient\r\nof the seeming confusion and disorder of the ancient hypotheses. But\r\nthis real arrangement never could have been detected by\r\nphilosophers, if the apparent motions had not been strictly examined\r\nand successfully analyzed. How far the connection between the facts\r\nand the true theory is from being obvious or easily traced, any one\r\nmay satisfy himself by endeavoring, from a general conception of the\r\nmoon's real motions, to discover the rules which regulate the\r\noccurrences of eclipses; or even to explain to a learner, of what\r\nnature the apparent motions of the moon among the stars will be.\r\n\r\nThe unquestionable evidence of the merit and value of the Theory of\r\nEpicycles is to be found in this circumstance;--that it served to\r\nembody all the most exact knowledge then extant, to direct\r\nastronomers to the proper methods of making it more exact and\r\ncomplete, to point out new objects of attention and research; and\r\nthat, after doing this at first, it was also able to take in, and\r\npreserve, all the new results of the active and persevering labors\r\nof a long series of Greek, Latin, Arabian, and modern European\r\nastronomers, till a new theory arose which could discharge this\r\noffice. It may, perhaps, surprise some readers to be told, that the\r\nauthor of this next _great_ step in astronomical theory, Copernicus,\r\nadopted the theory of epicycles; that is, he employed that which we\r\nhave spoken of as its really valuable characteristic. \"We[76\\3] must\r\nconfess,\" he says, \"that the celestial motions are circular, or\r\ncompounded of several circles, since their inequalities observe a\r\nfixed law and recur in value at certain intervals, which could not\r\nbe, except that they were circular; for a circle alone can make that\r\nwhich has been, recur again.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\3: Copernicus. _De Rev._ 1. i. c. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn this sense, therefore, the Hipparchian theory was a real and\r\nindestructible truth, which was not rejected, and replaced by\r\ndifferent truths, but was adopted and incorporated into every\r\nsucceeding astronomical theory; and which can never cease to be one\r\nof the most important and fundamental parts of our astronomical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection will show that, in the events just spoken of,\r\nthe introduction and establishment of the Theory of Epicycles, those\r\ncharacteristics were strictly exemplified, which we have asserted to\r\nbe the conditions of every real advance in progressive science;\r\nnamely, {155} the application of distinct and appropriate Ideas to a\r\nreal series of Facts. The distinctness of the geometrical\r\nconceptions which enabled Hipparchus to assign the Orbits of the Sun\r\nand Moon, requires no illustration; and we have just explained how\r\nthese ideas combined into a connected whole the various motions and\r\nplaces of those luminaries. To make this step in astronomy, required\r\ndiligence and care, exerted in collecting observations, and\r\nmathematical clearness and steadiness of view, exercised in seeing\r\nand showing that the theory was a successful analysis of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Discovery of the Precession of the Equinoxes._\r\n\r\nTHE same qualities which we trace in the researches of Hipparchus\r\nalready examined,--diligence in collecting observations, and\r\nclearness of idea in representing them,--appear also in other\r\ndiscoveries of his, which we must not pass unnoticed. The Precession\r\nof the Equinoxes, in particular, is one of the most important of\r\nthese discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance here brought into notice was a Change of Longitude\r\nof the Fixed Stars. The longitudes of the heavenly bodies, being\r\nmeasured from the point where the sun's annual path cuts the\r\nequator, will change if that path changes. Whether this happens,\r\nhowever, is not very easy to decide; for the sun's path among the\r\nstars is made out, not by merely looking at the heavens, but by a\r\nseries of inferences from other observable facts. Hipparchus used\r\nfor this purpose eclipses of the moon; for these, being exactly\r\nopposite to the sun, afford data in marking out his path. By\r\ncomparing the eclipses of his own time with those observed at an\r\nearlier period by Timocharis, he found that the bright star, Spica\r\nVirginis, was six degrees behind the equinoctial point in his own\r\ntime, and had been eight degrees behind the same point at an earlier\r\nepoch. The suspicion was thus suggested, that the longitudes of all\r\nthe stars increase perpetually; but Hipparchus had too truly\r\nphilosophical a spirit to take this for granted. He examined the\r\nplaces of Regulus, and those of other stars, as he had done those of\r\nSpica; and he found, in all these instances, a change of place which\r\ncould be explained by a certain alteration of position in the\r\ncircles to which the stars are referred, which alteration is\r\ndescribed as the Precession of the Equinoxes.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness with which Hipparchus conceived this change of\r\nrelation of the heavens, is manifested by the question which, as we\r\nare told by Ptolemy, he examined and decided;--that this motion of\r\nthe {156} heavens takes place about the poles of the ecliptic, and\r\nnot about those of the equator. The care with which he collected\r\nthis motion from the stars themselves, may be judged of from this,\r\nthat having made his first observations for this purpose on Spica\r\nand Regulus, zodiacal stars, his first suspicion was that the stars\r\nof the zodiac alone changed their longitude, which suspicion he\r\ndisproved by the examination of other stars. By his processes, the\r\nidea of the nature of the motion, and the evidence of its existence,\r\nthe two conditions of a discovery, were fully brought into view. The\r\nscale of the facts which Hipparchus was thus able to reduce to law,\r\nmay be in some measure judged of by recollecting that the\r\nprecession, from his time to ours, has only carried the stars\r\nthrough one sign of the zodiac; and that, to complete one revolution\r\nof the sky by the motion thus discovered, would require a period of\r\n25,000 years. Thus this discovery connected the various aspects of\r\nthe heavens at the most remote periods of human history; and,\r\naccordingly, the novel and ingenious views which Newton published in\r\nhis chronology, are founded on this single astronomical fact, the\r\nPrecession of the Equinoxes.\r\n\r\nThe two discoveries which have been described, the mode of\r\nconstructing Solar and Lunar Tables, and the Precession, were\r\nadvances of the greatest importance in astronomy, not only in\r\nthemselves, but in the new objects and undertakings which they\r\nsuggested to astronomers. The one discovery detected a constant law\r\nand order in the midst of perpetual change and apparent disorder;\r\nthe other disclosed mutation and movement perpetually operating\r\nwhere every thing had been supposed fixed and stationary. Such\r\ndiscoveries were well adapted to call up many questionings in the\r\nminds of speculative men; for, after this, nothing could be supposed\r\nconstant till it had been ascertained to be so by close examination;\r\nand no apparent complexity or confusion could justify the\r\nphilosopher in turning away in despair from the task of\r\nsimplification. To answer the inquiries thus suggested, new methods\r\nof observing the facts were requisite, more exact and uniform than\r\nthose hitherto employed. Moreover, the discoveries which were made,\r\nand others which could not fail to follow in their train, led to\r\nmany consequences, required to be reasoned upon, systematized,\r\ncompleted, enlarged. In short, the _Epoch of Induction_ led, as we\r\nhave stated that such epochs must always lead, to a _Period of\r\nDevelopment_, _of Verification_, _Application_, _and Extension_.\r\n{157}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE INDUCTIVE EPOCH OF HIPPARCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Researches which verified the Theory._\r\n\r\nTHE discovery of the leading Laws of the Solar and Lunar Motions,\r\nand the detection of the Precession, may be considered as the great\r\npositive steps in the Hipparchian astronomy;--the parent\r\ndiscoveries, from which many minor improvements proceeded. The task\r\nof pursuing the collateral and consequent researches which now\r\noffered themselves,--of bringing the other parts of astronomy up to\r\nthe level of its most improved portions,--was prosecuted by a\r\nsuccession of zealous observers and calculators, first, in the\r\nschool of Alexandria, and afterwards in other parts of the world. We\r\nmust notice the various labors of this series of astronomers; but we\r\nshall do so very briefly; for the ulterior development of doctrines\r\nonce established is not so important an object of contemplation for\r\nour present purpose, as the first conception and proof of those\r\nfundamental truths on which systematic doctrines are founded. Yet\r\nPeriods of Verification, as well as Epochs of Induction, deserve to\r\nbe attended to; and they can nowhere be studied with so much\r\nadvantage as in the history of astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn truth, however, Hipparchus did not leave to his successors the\r\ntask of pursuing into detail those views of the heavens to which his\r\ndiscoveries led him. He examined with scrupulous care almost every\r\npart of the subject. We must briefly mention some of the principal\r\npoints which were thus settled by him.\r\n\r\nThe verification of the laws of the changes which he assigned to the\r\nskies, implied that the condition of the heavens was constant,\r\nexcept so far as it was affected by those changes. Thus, the\r\ndoctrine that the changes of position of the stars were rightly\r\nrepresented by the precession of the equinoxes, supposed that the\r\nstars were fixed with regard to each other; and the doctrine that\r\nthe unequal number of days, in certain subdivisions of months and\r\nyears, was adequately explained by the theory of epicycles, assumed\r\nthat years and days were always of constant lengths. But Hipparchus\r\nwas not content with assuming these bases of his theory, he\r\nendeavored to prove them. {158}\r\n\r\n1. _Fixity of the Stars._--The question necessarily arose after the\r\ndiscovery of the precession, even if such a question had never\r\nsuggested itself before, whether the stars which were called\r\n_fixed_, and to which the motions of the other luminaries are\r\nreferred, do really retain constantly the same relative position. In\r\norder to determine this fundamental question, Hipparchus undertook\r\nto construct a _Map_ of the heavens; for though the result of his\r\nsurvey was expressed in words, we may give this name to his\r\nCatalogue of the positions of the most conspicuous stars. These\r\npositions are described by means of _alineations_; that is, three or\r\nmore such stars are selected as can be touched by an apparent\r\nstraight line drawn in the heavens. Thus Hipparchus observed that\r\nthe southern claw of Cancer, the bright star in the same\r\nconstellation which precedes the head of the Hydra, and the bright\r\nstar Procyon, were nearly in the same line. Ptolemy quotes this and\r\nmany other of the configurations which Hipparchus had noted, in\r\norder to show that the positions of the stars had not changed in the\r\nintermediate time; a truth which the catalogue of Hipparchus thus\r\ngave astronomers the means of ascertaining. It contained 1080 stars.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this catalogue of the stars by Hipparchus is an\r\nevent of great celebrity in the history of astronomy. Pliny,[77\\3]\r\nwho speaks of it with admiration as a wonderful and superhuman task\r\n(\"ausus rem etiam Deo improbam, annumerare posteris stellas\"),\r\nasserts the undertaking to have been suggested by a remarkable\r\nastronomical event, the appearance of a new star; \"novam stellam et\r\nalium in ævo suo genitam deprehendit; ejusque motu, qua die fulsit,\r\nad dubitationem est adductus anne hoc sæpius fieret, moverenturque\r\net eæ quas putamus affixas.\" There is nothing inherently improbable\r\nin this tradition, but we may observe, with Delambre,[78\\3] that we\r\nare not informed whether this new star remained in the sky, or soon\r\ndisappeared again. Ptolemy makes no mention of the star or the\r\nstory; and his catalogue contains no _bright_ star which is not\r\nfound in the \"Catasterisms\" of Eratosthenes. These Catasterisms were\r\nan enumeration of 475 of the principal stars, according to the\r\nconstellations in which they are, and were published about sixty\r\nyears before Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\3: _Nat. Hist._ lib. ii. (xxvi.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\3: _A. A._ i. 290.]\r\n\r\n2. _Constant Length of Years._--Hipparchus also attempted to\r\nascertain whether successive years are all of the same length; and\r\nthough, with his scrupulous love of accuracy,[79\\3] he does not\r\nappear to have {159} thought himself justified in asserting that the\r\nyears were always exactly equal, he showed, both by observations of\r\nthe time when the sun passed the equinoxes, and by eclipses, that\r\nthe difference of successive years, if there were any difference,\r\nmust be extremely slight. The observations of succeeding\r\nastronomers, and especially of Ptolemy, confirmed this opinion, and\r\nproved, with certainty, that there is no progressive increase or\r\ndiminution in the duration of the year.\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\3: Ptolem. _Synt._ iii. 2.]\r\n\r\n3. _Constant Length of Days. Equation of Time._--The equality of\r\ndays was more difficult to ascertain than that of years; for the\r\nyear is measured, as on a natural scale, by the number of days which\r\nit contains; but the day can be subdivided into hours only by\r\nartificial means; and the mechanical skill of the ancients did not\r\nenable them to attain any considerable accuracy in the measure of\r\nsuch portions of time; though clepsydras and similar instruments\r\nwere used by astronomers. The equality of days could only be proved,\r\ntherefore, by the consequences of such a supposition; and in this\r\nmanner it appears to have been assumed, as the fact really is, that\r\nthe apparent revolution of the stars is accurately uniform, never\r\nbecoming either quicker or slower. It followed, as a consequence of\r\nthis, that the solar days (or rather the _nycthemers_, compounded of\r\na night and a day) would be unequal, in consequence of the sun's\r\nunequal motion, thus giving rise to what we now call the _Equation\r\nof Time_,--the interval by which the time, as marked on a dial, is\r\nbefore or after the time, as indicated by the accurate timepieces\r\nwhich modern skill can produce. This inequality was fully taken\r\naccount of by the ancient astronomers; and they thus in fact assumed\r\nthe equality of the sidereal days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Researches which did not verify the Theory._\r\n\r\nSOME of the researches of Hipparchus and his followers fell upon the\r\nweak parts of his theory; and if the observations had been\r\nsufficiently exact, must have led to its being corrected or rejected.\r\n\r\nAmong these we may notice the researches which were made concerning\r\nthe _Parallax_ of the heavenly bodies, that is, their apparent\r\ndisplacement by the alteration of position of the observer from one\r\npart of the earth's surface to the other. This subject is treated of\r\nat length by Ptolemy; and there can be no doubt that it was well\r\nexamined by Hipparchus, who invented a _parallactic instrument_ for\r\nthat purpose. The idea of parallax, as a geometrical possibility,\r\nwas indeed too obvious to be overlooked by geometers at any time;\r\nand when the doctrine of the sphere was established, it must have\r\nappeared strange {160} to the student, that every place on the\r\nearth's surface might alike be considered as the centre of the\r\ncelestial motions. But if this was true with respect to the motions\r\nof the fixed stars, was it also true with regard to those of the sun\r\nand moon? The displacement of the sun by parallax is so small, that\r\nthe best observers among the ancients could never be sure of its\r\nexistence; but with respect to the moon, the case is different. She\r\nmay be displaced by this cause to the amount of twice her own\r\nbreadth, a quantity easily noticed by the rudest process of\r\ninstrumental observation. The law of the displacement thus produced\r\nis easily obtained by theory, the globular form of the earth being\r\nsupposed known; but the amount of the displacement depends upon the\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth, and requires at least one good\r\nobservation to determine it. Ptolemy has given a table of the\r\neffects of parallax, calculated according to the apparent altitude\r\nof the moon, assuming certain supposed distances; these distances,\r\nhowever, do not follow the real law of the moon's distances, in\r\nconsequence of their being founded upon the Hypothesis of the\r\nEccentric and Epicycle.\r\n\r\nIn fact this Hypothesis, though a very close representation of the\r\ntruth, so far as the _positions_ of the luminaries are concerned,\r\nfails altogether when we apply it to their _distances_. The radius\r\nof the epicycle, or the eccentricity of the eccentric, are\r\ndetermined so as to satisfy the observations of the apparent\r\n_motions_ of the bodies; but, inasmuch as the hypothetical motions\r\nare different altogether from the real motions, the Hypothesis does\r\nnot, at the same time, satisfy the observations of the _distances_\r\nof the bodies, if we are able to make any such observations.\r\n\r\nParallax is one method by which the distances of the moon, at\r\ndifferent times, may be compared; her Apparent Diameters afford\r\nanother method. Neither of these modes, however, is easily capable\r\nof such accuracy as to overturn at once the Hypothesis of epicycles;\r\nand, accordingly, the Hypothesis continued to be entertained in\r\nspite of such measures; the measures being, indeed, in some degree\r\nfalsified in consequence of the reigning opinion. In fact, however,\r\nthe imperfection of the methods of measuring parallax and magnitude,\r\nwhich were in use at this period, was such, their results could not\r\nlead to any degree of conviction deserving to be set in opposition\r\nto a theory which was so satisfactory with regard to the more\r\ncertain observations, namely, those of the motions.\r\n\r\nThe Eccentricity, or the Radius of the Epicycle, which would satisfy\r\n{161} the inequality of the _motions_ of the moon, would, in fact,\r\ndouble the inequality of the _distances_. The Eccentricity of the\r\nmoon's orbit is determined by Ptolemy as 1/12 of the radius of the\r\norbit; but its real amount is only half as great; this difference is\r\na necessary consequence of the supposition of uniform circular\r\nmotions, on which the Epicyclic Hypothesis proceeds.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that this part of the Hipparchian theory carries\r\nin itself the germ of its own destruction. As soon as the art of\r\ncelestial measurement was so far perfected, that astronomers could\r\nbe sure of the apparent diameter of the moon within 1/30 or 1/40 of\r\nthe whole, the inconsistency of the theory with itself would become\r\nmanifest. We shall see, hereafter, the way in which this\r\ninconsistency operated; in reality a very long period elapsed before\r\nthe methods of observing were sufficiently good to bring it clearly\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3._--Methods of Observation of the Greek Astronomers._\r\n\r\nWE must now say a word concerning the Methods above spoken of. Since\r\none of the most important tasks of verification is to ascertain with\r\naccuracy the magnitude of the quantities which enter, as elements,\r\ninto the theory which occupies men during the period; the\r\nimprovement of instruments, and the methods of observing and\r\nexperimenting, are principal features in such periods. We shall,\r\ntherefore, mention some of the facts which bear upon this point.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of distances among the stars by the eye, is an\r\nextremely inexact process. In some of the ancient observations,\r\nhowever, this appears to have been the method employed; and stars\r\nare described as being _a cubit_ or _two cubits_ from other stars.\r\nWe may form some notion of the scale of this kind of measurement,\r\nfrom what Cleomedes remarks,[80\\3] that the sun appears to be about\r\na foot broad; an opinion which he confutes at length.\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\3: Del. _A. A._ i. 222.]\r\n\r\nA method of determining the positions of the stars, susceptible of a\r\nlittle more exactness than the former, is the use of _alineations_,\r\nalready noticed in speaking of Hipparchus's catalogue. Thus, a\r\nstraight line passing through two stars of the Great Bear passes\r\nalso through the pole-star; this is, indeed, even now a method\r\nusually employed to enable us readily to fix on the pole-star; and\r\nthe two stars β and α of Ursa Major, are hence often called \"the\r\npointers.\" {162}\r\n\r\nBut nothing like accurate measurements of any portions of the sky\r\nwere obtained, till astronomers adopted the method of making visual\r\ncoincidences of the objects with the instruments, either by means of\r\n_shadows_ or of _sights_.\r\n\r\nProbably the oldest and most obvious measurements of the positions\r\nof the heavenly bodies were those in which the elevation of the sun\r\nwas determined by comparing the length of the shadow of an upright\r\nstaff or _gnomon_, with the length of the staff itself. It\r\nappears,[81\\3] from a memoir of Gautil, first printed in the\r\n_Connaissance des Temps_ for 1809, that, at the lower town of\r\nLoyang, now called Hon-anfou, Tchon-kong found the length of the\r\nshadow of the gnomon, at the summer solstice, equal to one foot and\r\na half, the gnomon itself being eight feet in length. This was about\r\n1100 B. C. The Greeks, at an early period, used the same method.\r\nStrabo says[82\\3] that \"Byzantium and Marseilles are on the same\r\nparallel of latitude, because the shadows at those places have the\r\nsame proportion to the gnomon, according to the statement of\r\nHipparchus, who follows Pytheas.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\3: Lib. U. K. _Hist. Ast._ p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\3: Del. _A. A._ i. 257.]\r\n\r\nBut the relations of position which astronomy considers, are, for\r\nthe most part, angular distances; and these are most simply\r\nexpressed by the intercepted portion of a circumference described\r\nabout the angular point. The use of the gnomon might lead to the\r\ndetermination of the angle by the graphical methods of geometry; but\r\nthe numerical expression of the circumference required some progress\r\nin trigonometry; for instance, a table of the tangents of angles.\r\n\r\nInstruments were soon invented for measuring angles, by means of\r\ncircles, which had a border or _limb_, divided into equal parts. The\r\nwhole circumference was divided into 360 _degrees_: perhaps because\r\nthe circles, first so divided, were those which represented the\r\nsun's annual path; one such degree would be the sun's daily advance,\r\nmore nearly than any other convenient aliquot part which could be\r\ntaken. The position of the sun was determined by means of the shadow\r\nof one part of the instrument upon the other. The most ancient\r\ninstrument of this kind appears to be the _Hemisphere of Berosus_. A\r\nhollow hemisphere was placed with its rim horizontal, and a style\r\nwas erected in such a manner that the extremity of the style was\r\nexactly at the centre of the sphere. The shadow of this extremity,\r\non the concave surface, had the same position with regard to the\r\nlowest point of the sphere which the sun had with regard to the\r\nhighest point of the heavens. {163} But this instrument was in fact\r\nused rather for dividing the day into portions of time than for\r\ndetermining position.\r\n\r\nEratosthenes[83\\3] observed the amount of the obliquity of the sun's\r\npath to the equator: we are not informed what instruments he used\r\nfor this purpose; but he is said to have obtained, from the\r\nmunificence of Ptolemy Euergetes, two _Armils_, or instruments\r\ncomposed of circles, which were placed in the portico at Alexandria,\r\nand long used for observations. If a circular rim or hoop were\r\nplaced so as to coincide with the plane of the equator, the inner\r\nconcave edge would be enlightened by the sun's rays which came under\r\nthe front edge, when the sun was south of the equator, and by the\r\nrays which came over the front edge, when the sun was north of the\r\nequator: the moment of the transition would be the time of the\r\nequinox. Such an instrument appears to be referred to by Hipparchus,\r\nas quoted by Ptolemy.[84\\3] \"The circle of copper, which stands at\r\nAlexandria in what is called the Square Porch, appears to mark, as\r\nthe day of the equinox, that on which the concave surface begins to\r\nbe enlightened from the other side.\" Such an instrument was called\r\nan _equinoctial armil_.\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\3: Delambre, _A. A._ i. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\3: Ptol. _Synt._ iii. 2.]\r\n\r\nA _solstitial armil_ is described by Ptolemy, consisting of two\r\ncircular rims, one sliding round within the other, and the inner one\r\nfurnished with two pegs standing out from its surface at right\r\nangles, and diametrically opposite to each other. These circles\r\nbeing fixed in the plane of the meridian, and the inner one turned,\r\ntill, at noon, the shadow of the peg in front falls upon the peg\r\nbehind, the position of the sun at noon would be determined by the\r\ndegrees on the outer circle.\r\n\r\nIn calculation, the degree was conceived to be divided into 60\r\n_minutes_, the minute into 60 _seconds_, and so on. But in practice\r\nit was impossible to divide the limb of the instrument into parts so\r\nsmall. The armils of Alexandria were divided into no parts smaller\r\nthan sixths of degrees, or divisions of 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe angles, observed by means of these divisions, were expressed as\r\na fraction of the circumference. Thus Eratosthenes stated the\r\ninterval between the tropics to be 11/83 of the circumference.[85\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\3: Delambre, _A. A._ i. 87. It is probable that his\r\nobservation gave him 47⅔ degrees. The fraction 47⅔/360 = 143/1080 =\r\n11 ∙ 13/1080  = 11/(83+1/13), which is very nearly 11/83.]\r\n\r\nIt was soon remarked that the whole circumference of the circle\r\n{164} was not wanted for such observations. Ptolemy[86\\3] says that\r\nhe found it more convenient to observe altitudes by means of a\r\nsquare flat piece of stone or wood, with a _quadrant_ of a circle\r\ndescribed on one of its flat faces, about a centre near one of the\r\nangles. A peg was placed at the centre, and one of the extreme radii\r\nof the quadrant being perpendicular to the horizon, the elevation of\r\nthe sun above the horizon was determined by observing the point of\r\nthe arc of the quadrant on which the shadow of the peg fell.\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\3: _Synt._ i. 1.]\r\n\r\nAs the necessity of accuracy in the observations was more and more\r\nfelt, various adjustments of such instruments were practised. The\r\ninstruments were placed in the meridian by means of a _meridian\r\nline_ drawn by astronomical methods on the floor on which they\r\nstood. The plane of the instrument was made vertical by means of a\r\nplumb-line: the bounding radius, from which angles were measured,\r\nwas also adjusted by the _plumb-line_.[87\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\3: The curvature of the plane of the circle, by warping,\r\nwas noticed. Ptol. iii. 2. p. 155, observes that his equatorial\r\ncircle was illuminated on the hollow side twice in the same day. (He\r\ndid not know that this might arise from refraction.)]\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the places of the sun and of the moon could be\r\nobserved by means of the shadows which they cast. In order to\r\nobserve the stars,[88\\3] the observer looked along the face of the\r\ncircle of the armil, so as to see its two edges apparently brought\r\ntogether, and the star apparently touching them.[89\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\3: Delamb. _A. A._ i. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\3: Ptol. _Synt._ i. 1. Ὥσπερ κεκολλήμενος ἀμφοτέραις αὐτῶν\r\nταῖς ἐπιφανείαις ὁ ἀστὴρ ἐν τῷ δι' αὐτῶν ἐπιπέδῳ διοπτεύηται.]\r\n\r\nIt was afterwards found important to ascertain the position of the\r\nsun with regard to the ecliptic: and, for this purpose, an\r\ninstrument, called an _astrolabe_, was invented, of which we have a\r\ndescription in Ptolemy.[90\\3] This also consisted of circular rims,\r\nmovable within one another, or about poles; and contained circles\r\nwhich were to be brought into the position of the ecliptic, and of a\r\nplane passing through the sun and the poles of the ecliptic. The\r\nposition of the moon with regard to the ecliptic, and its position\r\nin longitude with regard to the sun or a star, were thus determined.\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\3: _Synt._ v. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe astrolabe continued long in use, but not so long as the quadrant\r\ndescribed by Ptolemy; this, in a larger form, is the _mural\r\nquadrant_, which has been used up to the most recent times.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered surprising,[91\\3] that Hipparchus, after having\r\n{165} observed, for some time, right ascensions and declinations,\r\nquitted equatorial armils for the astrolabe, which immediately\r\nrefers the stars to the ecliptic. He probably did this because,\r\nafter the discovery of precession, he found the latitudes of the\r\nstars constant, and wanted to ascertain their motion in longitude.\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\3: Del. _A. A._ 181.]\r\n\r\nTo the above instruments, may be added the _dioptra_, and the\r\n_parallactic instrument_ of Hipparchus and Ptolemy. In the latter,\r\nthe distance of a star from the zenith was observed by looking\r\nthrough two sights fixed in a rule, this being annexed to another\r\nrule, which was kept in a vertical position by a plumb-line; and the\r\nangle between the two rules was measured.\r\n\r\nThe following example of an observation, taken from Ptolemy, may\r\nserve to show the form in which the results of the instruments, just\r\ndescribed, were usually stated.[92\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\3: Del. _A. A._ ii. 248.]\r\n\r\n\"In the 2d year of Antoninus, the 9th day of Pharmouthi, the sun\r\nbeing near setting, the last division of Taurus being on the\r\nmeridian (that is, 5½ equinoctial hours after noon), the moon was in\r\n3 degrees of Pisces, by her distance from the sun (which was 92\r\ndegrees, 8 minutes); and half an hour after, the sun being set, and\r\nthe quarter of Gemini on the meridian, Regulus appeared, by the\r\nother circle of the astrolabe, 57½ degrees more forwards than the\r\nmoon in longitude.\" From these data the longitude of Regulus is\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said respecting the observations of the\r\nAlexandrian astronomers, it will have been seen that their\r\ninstrumental observations could not be depended on for any close\r\naccuracy. This defect, after the general reception of the\r\nHipparchian theory, operated very unfavorably on the progress of the\r\nscience. If they could have traced the moon's place distinctly from\r\nday to day, they must soon have discovered all the inequalities\r\nwhich were known to Tycho Brahe; and if they could have measured her\r\nparallax or her diameter with any considerable accuracy, they must\r\nhave obtained a confutation of the epicycloidal form of her orbit.\r\nBy the badness of their observations, and the imperfect agreement of\r\nthese with calculation, they not only were prevented making such\r\nsteps, but were led to receive the theory with a servile assent and\r\nan indistinct apprehension, instead of that rational conviction and\r\nintuitive clearness which would have given a progressive impulse to\r\ntheir knowledge. {166}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Period from Hipparchus to Ptolemy._\r\n\r\nWE have now to speak of the cultivators of astronomy from the time\r\nof Hipparchus to that of Ptolemy, the next great name which occurs\r\nin the history of this science; though even he holds place only\r\namong those who verified, developed, and extended the theory of\r\nHipparchus. The astronomers who lived in the intermediate time,\r\nindeed, did little, even in this way; though it might have been\r\nsupposed that their studies were carried on under considerable\r\nadvantages, inasmuch as they all enjoyed the liberal patronage of\r\nthe kings of Egypt.[93\\3] The \"divine school of Alexandria,\" as it\r\nis called by Synesius, in the fourth century, appears to have\r\nproduced few persons capable of carrying forwards, or even of\r\nverifying, the labors of its great astronomical teacher. The\r\nmathematicians of the school wrote much, and apparently they\r\nobserved sometimes; but their observations are of little value; and\r\ntheir books are expositions of the theory and its geometrical\r\nconsequences, without any attempt to compare it with observation.\r\nFor instance, it does not appear that any one verified the\r\nremarkable discovery of the precession, till the time of Ptolemy,\r\n250 years after; nor does the statement of this motion of the\r\nheavens appear in the treatises of the intermediate writers; nor\r\ndoes Ptolemy quote a single observation of any person made in this\r\nlong interval of time; while his references to those of Hipparchus\r\nare perpetual; and to those of Aristyllus and Timocharis, and of\r\nothers, as Conon, who preceded Hipparchus, are not unfrequent.\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\3: Delamb. _A. A._ ii. 240.]\r\n\r\nThis Alexandrian period, so inactive and barren in the history of\r\nscience, was prosperous, civilized, and literary; and many of the\r\nworks which belong to it are come down to us, though those of\r\nHipparchus are lost. We have the \"Uranologion\" of Geminus,[94\\3] a\r\nsystematic treatise on Astronomy, expounding correctly the\r\nHipparchian Theories and their consequences, and containing a good\r\naccount of the use of the various Cycles, which ended in the\r\nadoption of the Calippic Period. We have likewise \"The Circular\r\nTheory of the Celestial Bodies\" of Cleomedes,[95\\3] of which the\r\nprincipal part is a development of the doctrine of the sphere,\r\nincluding the consequences of the globular form of the earth. We\r\nhave also another work on \"Spherics\" by Theodosius of\r\nBithynia,[96\\3] which contains some of the most important\r\npropositions of the subject, and has been used as a book of {167}\r\ninstruction even in modern times. Another writer on the same subject\r\nis Menelaus, who lived somewhat later, and whose Three Books on\r\nSpherics still remain.\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\3: B. C. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\3: B. C. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\3: B. C. 50.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important kinds of deduction from a geometrical\r\ntheory, such as that of the doctrine of the sphere, or that of\r\nepicycles, is the calculation of its numerical results in particular\r\ncases. With regard to the latter theory, this was done in the\r\nconstruction of Solar and Lunar Tables, as we have already seen; and\r\nthis process required the formation of a _Trigonometry_, or system\r\nof rules for calculating the relations between the sides and angles\r\nof triangles. Such a science had been formed by Hipparchus, who\r\nappears to be the author of every great step in ancient\r\nastronomy.[97\\3] He wrote a work in twelve books, \"On the\r\nConstruction of the Tables of Chords of Arcs;\" such a table being\r\nthe means by which the Greeks solved their triangles. The Doctrine\r\nof the Sphere required, in like manner, a _Spherical Trigonometry_,\r\nin order to enable mathematicians to calculate its results; and this\r\nbranch of science also appears to have been formed by\r\nHipparchus,[98\\3] who gives results that imply the possession of\r\nsuch a method. Hypsicles, who was a contemporary of Ptolemy, also\r\nmade some attempts at the solution of such problems: but it is\r\nextraordinary that the writers whom we have mentioned as coming\r\nafter Hipparchus, namely, Theodosius, Cleomedes, and Menelaus, do\r\nnot even mention the calculation of triangles,[99\\3] either plain or\r\nspherical; though the latter writer[100\\3] is said to have written\r\non \"the Table of Chords,\" a work which is now lost.\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\3: Delamb. _A. A._ ii. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\3: _A. A._ i. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\3: _A. A._ i. 249.]\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\3: _A. A._ ii. 37.]\r\n\r\nWe shall see, hereafter, how prevalent a disposition in literary\r\nages is that which induces authors to become commentators. This\r\ntendency showed itself at an early period in the school of\r\nAlexandria. Aratus,[101\\3] who lived 270 B. C. at the court of\r\nAntigonus, king of Macedonia, described the celestial constellations\r\nin two poems, entitled \"Phænomena,\" and \"Prognostics.\" These poems\r\nwere little more than a versification of the treatise of Eudoxus on\r\nthe acronycal and heliacal risings and settings of the stars. The\r\nwork was the subject of a comment by Hipparchus, who perhaps found\r\nthis the easiest way of giving connection and circulation to his\r\nknowledge. Three Latin translations of this poem gave the Romans the\r\nmeans of becoming acquainted with it: the first is by Cicero, of\r\nwhich we have numerous fragments {168} extant;[102\\3] Germanicus\r\nCæsar, one of the sons-in-law of Augustus, also translated the poem,\r\nand this translation remains almost entire. Finally, we have a\r\ncomplete translation by Avienus.[103\\3] The \"Astronomica\" of\r\nManilius, the \"Poeticon Astronomicon\" of Hyginus, both belonging to\r\nthe time of Augustus, are, like the work of Aratus, poems which\r\ncombine mythological ornament with elementary astronomical\r\nexposition; but have no value in the history of science. We may pass\r\nnearly the same judgment upon the explanations and declamations of\r\nCicero, Seneca, and Pliny, for they do not apprise us of any\r\nadditions to astronomical knowledge; and they do not always indicate\r\na very clear apprehension of the doctrines which the writers adopt.\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\3:  _A. A._ i. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\3: Two copies of this translation, illustrated by drawings\r\nof different ages, one set Roman, and the other Saxon, according to\r\nMr. Ottley, are described in the _Archæologia_, vol. xviii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\3: Montucla, i. 221.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature in the two last-named writers,\r\nis the declamatory expression of their admiration for the\r\ndiscoverers of physical knowledge; and in one of them, Seneca, the\r\npersuasion of a boundless progress in science to which man was\r\ndestined. Though this belief was no more than a vague and arbitrary\r\nconjecture, it suggested other conjectures in detail, some of which,\r\nhaving been verified, have attracted much notice. For instance, in\r\nspeaking of comets,[104\\3] Seneca says, \"The time will come when\r\nthose things which are now hidden shall be brought to light by time\r\nand persevering diligence. Our posterity will wonder that we should\r\nbe ignorant of what is so obvious.\" \"The motions of the planets,\" he\r\nadds, \"complex and seemingly confused, have been reduced to rule;\r\nand some one will come hereafter, who will reveal to us the paths of\r\ncomets.\" Such convictions and conjectures are not to be admired for\r\ntheir wisdom; for Seneca was led rather by enthusiasm, than by any\r\nsolid reasons, to entertain this opinion; nor, again, are they to be\r\nconsidered as merely lucky guesses, implying no merit; they are\r\nremarkable as showing how the persuasion of the universality of law,\r\nand the belief of the probability of its discovery by man, grow up\r\nin men's minds, when speculative knowledge becomes a prominent\r\nobject of attention.\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\3: Seneca, _Qu. N._ vii. 25.]\r\n\r\nAn important practical application of astronomical knowledge was\r\nmade by Julius Cæsar, in his correction of the calendar, which we\r\nhave already noticed; and this was strictly due to the Alexandrian\r\nSchool: Sosigenes, an astronomer belonging to that school, came from\r\nEgypt to Rome for the purpose. {169}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Measures of the Earth._\r\n\r\nTHERE were, as we have said, few attempts made, at the period of\r\nwhich we are speaking, to improve the accuracy of any of the\r\ndeterminations of the early Alexandrian astronomers. One question\r\nnaturally excited much attention at all times, the _magnitude_ of\r\nthe earth, its figure being universally acknowledged to be a globe.\r\nThe Chaldeans, at an earlier period, had asserted that a man,\r\nwalking without stopping, might go round the circuit of the earth in\r\na year; but this might be a mere fancy, or a mere guess. The attempt\r\nof Eratosthenes to decide this question went upon principles\r\nentirely correct. Syene was situated on the tropic; for there, on\r\nthe day of the solstice, at noon, objects cast no shadow; and a well\r\nwas enlightened to the bottom by the sun's rays. At Alexandria, on\r\nthe same day, the sun was, at noon, distant from the zenith by a\r\nfiftieth part of the circumference. Those two cities were north and\r\nsouth from each other: and the distance had been determined, by the\r\nroyal overseers of the roads, to be 5000 stadia. This gave a\r\ncircumference of 250,000 stadia to the earth, and a radius of about\r\n40,000. Aristotle[105\\3] says that the mathematicians make the\r\ncircumference 400,000 stadia. Hipparchus conceived that the measure\r\nof Eratosthenes ought to be increased by about one-tenth.[106\\3]\r\nPosidonius, the friend of Cicero, made another attempt of the same\r\nkind. At Rhodes, the star Canopus but just appeared above the\r\nhorizon; at Alexandria, the same star rose to an altitude of 1/48th\r\nof the circumference; the direct distance on the meridian was 5000\r\nstadia, which gave 240,000 for the whole circuit. We cannot look\r\nupon these measures as very precise; the stadium employed is not\r\ncertainly known; and no peculiar care appears to have been bestowed\r\non the measure of the direct distance.\r\n\r\n[Note 105\\3: _De Cœlo_, ii. ad fin.]\r\n\r\n[Note 106\\3: Plin. ii. (cviii.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the Arabians, in the ninth century, came to be the principal\r\ncultivators of astronomy, they repeated this observation in a manner\r\nmore suited to its real importance and capacity of exactness. Under\r\nthe Caliph Almamon,[107\\3] the vast plain of Singiar, in\r\nMesopotamia, was the scene of this undertaking. The Arabian\r\nastronomers there divided themselves into two bands, one under the\r\ndirection of Chalid ben Abdolmalic, and the other having at its head\r\nAlis ben Isa. These two parties proceeded, the one north, the other\r\nsouth, determining the distance by the actual application of their\r\nmeasuring-rods to the ground, {170} till each was found, by\r\nastronomical observation, to be a degree from the place at which\r\nthey started. It then appeared that these terrestrial degrees were\r\nrespectively 56 miles, and 56 miles and two-thirds, the mile being\r\n4000 cubits. In order to remove all doubt concerning the scale of\r\nthis measure, we are informed that the cubit is that called the\r\nblack cubit, which consists of 27 inches, each inch being the\r\nthickness of six grains of barley.\r\n\r\n[Note 107\\3: Montu. 357.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_Ptolemy's Discovery of Evection._\r\n\r\nBY referring, in this place, to the last-mentioned measure of the\r\nearth, we include the labors of the Arabian as well as the\r\nAlexandrian astronomers, in the period of mere detail, which forms\r\nthe sequel to the great astronomical revolution of the Hipparchian\r\nepoch. And this period of verification is rightly extended to those\r\nlater times; not merely because astronomers were then still employed\r\nin determining the magnitude of the earth, and the amount of other\r\nelements of the theory,--for these are some of their employments to\r\nthe present day,--but because no great intervening discovery marks a\r\nnew epoch, and begins a new period;--because no great revolution in\r\nthe theory added to the objects of investigation, or presented them\r\nin a new point of view. This being the case, it will be more\r\ninstructive for our purpose to consider the general character and\r\nbroad intellectual features of this period, than to offer a useless\r\ncatalogue of obscure and worthless writers, and of opinions either\r\nborrowed or unsound. But before we do this, there is one writer whom\r\nwe cannot leave undistinguished in the crowd; since his name is more\r\ncelebrated even than that of Hipparchus; his works contain\r\nninety-nine hundredths of what we know of the Greek astronomy; and\r\nthough he was not the author of a new theory, he made some very\r\nremarkable steps in the verification, correction, and extension of\r\nthe theory which he received. I speak of Ptolemy, whose work, \"The\r\nMathematical Construction\" (of the heavens), contains a complete\r\nexposition of the state of astronomy in his time, the reigns of\r\nAdrian and Antonine. This book is familiarly known to us by a term\r\nwhich contains the record of our having received our first knowledge\r\nof it from the Arabic writers. The \"_Megiste_ Syntaxis,\" or Great\r\nConstruction, gave rise, among them, to the title _Al Magisti_, or\r\n_Almagest_, by which the work is commonly described. As a\r\nmathematical exposition of the Theory of Epicycles and Eccentrics,\r\nof the observations and calculations which were employed in {171}\r\norder to apply this theory to the sun, moon, and planets, and of the\r\nother calculations which are requisite, in order to deduce the\r\nconsequences of this theory, the work is a splendid and lasting\r\nmonument of diligence, skill, and judgment. Indeed, all the other\r\nastronomical works of the ancients hardly add any thing whatever to\r\nthe information we obtain from the Almagest; and the knowledge which\r\nthe student possesses of the ancient astronomy must depend mainly\r\nupon his acquaintance with Ptolemy. Among other merits, Ptolemy has\r\nthat of giving us a very copious account of the manner in which\r\nHipparchus established the main points of his theories; an account\r\nthe more agreeable, in consequence of the admiration and enthusiasm\r\nwith which this author everywhere speaks of the great master of the\r\nastronomical school.\r\n\r\nIn our present survey of the writings of Ptolemy, we are concerned\r\nless with his exposition of what had been done before him, than with\r\nhis own original labors. In most of the branches of the subject, he\r\ngave additional exactness to what Hipparchus had done; but our main\r\nbusiness, at present, is with those parts of the Almagest which\r\ncontain new steps in the application of the Hipparchian hypothesis.\r\nThere are two such cases, both very remarkable,--that of the moon's\r\n_Evection_, and that of the _Planetary Motions_.\r\n\r\nThe law of the moon's anomaly, that is, of the leading and obvious\r\ninequality of her motion, could be represented, as we have seen,\r\neither by an eccentric or an epicycle; and the amount of this\r\ninequality had been collected by observations of eclipses. But\r\nthough the hypothesis of an epicycle, for instance, would bring the\r\nmoon to her proper place, so far as eclipses could show it, that is,\r\nat new and full moon, this hypothesis did not rightly represent her\r\nmotions at other points of her course. This appeared, when Ptolemy\r\nset about measuring her distances from the sun at different times.\r\n\"These,\" he[108\\3] says, \"sometimes agreed, and sometimes\r\ndisagreed.\" But by further attention to the facts, a rule was\r\ndetected in these differences. \"As my knowledge became more complete\r\nand more connected, so as to show the order of this new inequality,\r\nI perceived that this difference was small, or nothing, at new and\r\nfull moon; and that at both the _dichotomies_ (when the moon is half\r\nilluminated) it was small, or nothing, if the moon was at the apogee\r\nor perigee of the epicycle, and was greatest when she was in the\r\nmiddle of the interval, and therefore when the first {172} inequality\r\nwas greatest also.\" He then adds some further remarks on the\r\ncircumstances according to which the moon's place, as affected by\r\nthis new inequality, is before or behind the place, as given by the\r\nepicyclical hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Note 108\\3: _Synth._ v. 2.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the announcement of the celebrated discovery of the moon's\r\nsecond inequality, afterwards called (by Bullialdus) the _Evection_.\r\nPtolemy soon proceeded to represent this inequality by a combination\r\nof circular motions, uniting, for this purpose, the hypothesis of an\r\nepicycle, already employed to explain the first inequality, with the\r\nhypothesis of an eccentric, in the circumference of which the centre\r\nof the epicycle was supposed to move. The mode of combining these\r\nwas somewhat complex; more complex we may, perhaps, say, than was\r\nabsolutely requisite;[109\\3] the apogee of the eccentric moved\r\nbackwards, or contrary to the order of the signs, and the centre of\r\nthe epicycle moved forwards nearly twice as fast upon the\r\ncircumference of the eccentric, so as to reach a place nearly, but\r\nnot exactly, the same, as if it had moved in a concentric instead of\r\nan eccentric path. Thus the centre of the epicycle went twice round\r\nthe eccentric in the course of one month: and in this manner it\r\nsatisfied the condition that it should vanish at new and full moon,\r\nand be greatest when the moon was in the quarters of her monthly\r\ncourse.[110\\3]\r\n\r\n[Note 109\\3: If Ptolemy had used the hypothesis of an eccentric\r\ninstead of an epicycle for the first inequality of the moon, an\r\nepicycle would have represented the second inequality more simply\r\nthan his method did.]\r\n\r\n[Note 110\\3: I will insert here the explanation which my German\r\ntranslator, the late distinguished astronomer Littrow, has given of\r\nthis point. The Rule of this Inequality, the Evection, may be most\r\nsimply expressed thus. If _a_ denote the excess of the Moon's\r\nLongitude over the Sun's, and _b_ the Anomaly of the Moon reckoned\r\nfrom her Perigee, the Evection is equal to 1°. 3. sin (2_a_ - _b_).\r\nAt New and Full Moon, _a_ is 0 or 180°, and thus the Evection is\r\n- 1°.3.sin _b_. At both quarters, or dichotomies, _a_ is 90° or 270°,\r\nand consequently the Evection is + 1°.3 . sin _b_. The Moon's\r\nElliptical Equation of the centre is at all points of her orbit\r\nequal to 6°.3.sin _b_. The Greek Astronomers before Ptolemy observed\r\nthe moon only at the time of eclipses; and hence they necessarily\r\nfound for the sum of these two greatest inequalities of the moon's\r\nmotion the quantity 6°.3. sin _b_ - 1°.3.sin _b_, or 5°.sin _b_: and\r\nas they took this for the moon's equation of the centre, which\r\ndepends upon the eccentricity of the moon's orbit, we obtain from\r\nthis too small equation of the centre, an eccentricity also smaller\r\nthan the truth. Ptolemy, who first observed the moon in her\r\nquarters, found for the sum of those Inequalities at those points\r\nthe quantity 6°.3.sin _b_ + 1°.3.sin _b_, or 7°.6.sin _b_; and thus\r\nmade the eccentricity of the moon as much too great at the quarters\r\nas the observers of eclipses had made it too small. He hence\r\nconcluded that the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is variable,\r\nwhich is not the case.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Evection, and the reduction of it to the {173}\r\nepicyclical theory, was, for several reasons, an important step in\r\nastronomy; some of these reasons may be stated.\r\n\r\n1. It obviously suggested, or confirmed, the suspicion that the\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies might be subject to _many_\r\ninequalities:--that when one set of anomalies had been discovered\r\nand reduced to rule, another set might come into view;--that the\r\ndiscovery of a rule was a step to the discovery of deviations from\r\nthe rule, which would require to be expressed in other rules;--that\r\nin the application of theory to observation, we find, not only the\r\n_stated phenomena_, for which the theory does account, but also\r\n_residual phenomena_, which remain unaccounted for, and stand out\r\nbeyond the calculation;--that thus nature is not simple and regular,\r\nby conforming to the simplicity and regularity of our hypotheses,\r\nbut leads us forwards to apparent complexity, and to an accumulation\r\nof rules and relations. A fact like the Evection, explained by an\r\nHypothesis like Ptolemy's, tended altogether to discourage any\r\ndisposition to guess at the laws of nature from mere ideal views, or\r\nfrom a few phenomena.\r\n\r\n2. The discovery of Evection had an importance which did not come\r\ninto view till long afterwards, in being the first of a numerous\r\nseries of inequalities of the moon, which results from the\r\n_Disturbing Force_ of the sun. These inequalities were successfully\r\ndiscovered; and led finally to the establishment of the law of\r\nuniversal gravitation. The moon's first inequality arises from a\r\ndifferent cause;--from the same cause as the inequality of the sun's\r\nmotion;--from the motion in an ellipse, so far as the central\r\nattraction is undisturbed by any other. This first inequality is\r\ncalled the Elliptic Inequality, or, more usually, the _Equation of\r\nthe Centre_.[111\\3] All the planets have such inequalities, but the\r\nEvection is peculiar to the moon. The discovery of other\r\ninequalities of the moon's motion, the Variation and Annual\r\nEquation, made an immediate sequel in the order of the subject to\r\n{174} the discoveries of Ptolemy, although separated by a long\r\ninterval of time; for these discoveries were only made by Tycho\r\nBrahe in the sixteenth century. The imperfection of astronomical\r\ninstruments was the great cause of this long delay.\r\n\r\n[Note 111\\3: The Equation of the Centre is the difference between\r\nthe place of the Planet in its elliptical orbit, and that place\r\nwhich a Planet would have, which revolved uniformly round the Sun as\r\na centre in a circular orbit in the same time. An imaginary Planet\r\nmoving in the manner last described, is called the _mean_ Planet,\r\nwhile the actual Planet which moves in the ellipse is called the\r\n_true_ Planet. The Longitude of the mean Planet at a given time is\r\neasily found, because its motion is uniform. By adding to it the\r\nEquation of the Centre, we find the Longitude of the true Planet,\r\nand thus, its place in its orbit.--_Littrow's Note_.\r\n\r\nI may add that the word _Equation_, used in such cases, denotes in\r\ngeneral a quantity which must be added to or subtracted from a mean\r\nquantity, to make it _equal_ to the true quantity; or rather, a\r\nquantity which must be added to or subtracted from a variably\r\nincreasing quantity to make it increase _equably_.]\r\n\r\n3. The Epicyclical Hypothesis was found capable of accommodating\r\nitself to such new discoveries. These new inequalities could be\r\nrepresented by new combinations of eccentrics and epicycles: all the\r\nreal and imaginary discoveries by astronomers, up to Copernicus,\r\nwere actually embodied in these hypotheses; Copernicus, as we have\r\nsaid, did not reject such hypotheses; the lunar inequalities which\r\nTycho detected might have been similarly exhibited; and even\r\nNewton[112\\3] represents the motion of the moon's apogee by means of\r\nan epicycle. As a mode of expressing the law of the irregularity,\r\nand of calculating its results in particular cases, the epicyclical\r\ntheory was capable of continuing to render great service to\r\nastronomy, however extensive the progress of the science might be.\r\nIt was, in fact, as we have already said, the modern process of\r\nrepresenting the motion by means of a series of circular functions.\r\n\r\n[Note 112\\3: _Principia_, lib. iii. prop. xxxv.]\r\n\r\n4. But though the doctrine of eccentrics and epicycles was thus\r\nadmissible as an Hypothesis, and convenient as a means of expressing\r\nthe laws of the heavenly motions, the successive occasions on which it\r\nwas called into use, gave no countenance to it as a Theory; that is,\r\nas a true view of the nature of these motions, and their causes. By\r\nthe steps of the progress of this Hypothesis, it became more and more\r\ncomplex, instead of becoming more simple, which, as we shall see, was\r\nthe course of the true Theory. The notions concerning the position and\r\nconnection of the heavenly bodies, which were suggested by one set of\r\nphenomena, were not confirmed by the indications of another set of\r\nphenomena; for instance, those relations of the epicycles which were\r\nadopted to account for the Motions of the heavenly bodies, were not\r\nfound to fall in with the consequences of their apparent Diameters and\r\nParallaxes. In reality, as we have said, if the relative distances of\r\nthe sun and moon at different times could have been accurately\r\ndetermined, the Theory of Epicycles must have been forthwith\r\noverturned. The insecurity of such measurements alone maintained the\r\ntheory to later times.[113\\3] {175}\r\n\r\n[Note 113\\3: The alteration of the apparent diameter of the moon is\r\nso great that it cannot escape us, even with very moderate\r\ninstruments. This apparent diameter contains, when the moon is\r\nnearest the earth, 2010 seconds; when she is furthest off 1762\r\nseconds; that is, 248 seconds, or 4 minutes 8 seconds, less than in\r\nthe former case. [The two quantities are in the proportion of 8 to\r\n7, nearly.]--_Littrow's Note_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 7.--_Conclusion of the History of Greek Astronomy._\r\n\r\nI MIGHT now proceed to give an account of Ptolemy's other great\r\nstep, the determination of the Planetary Orbits; but as this, though\r\nin itself very curious, would not illustrate any point beyond those\r\nalready noticed, I shall refer to it very briefly. The planets all\r\nmove in ellipses about the sun, as the moon moves about the earth;\r\nand as the sun apparently moves about the earth. They will therefore\r\neach have an Elliptic Inequality or Equation of the centre, for the\r\nsame reason that the sun and moon have such inequalities. And this\r\ninequality may be represented, in the cases of the planets, just as\r\nin the other two, by means of an eccentric; the epicycle, it will be\r\nrecollected, had already been used in order to represent the more\r\nobvious changes of the planetary motions. To determine the amount of\r\nthe Eccentricities and the places of the Apogees of the planetary\r\norbits, was the task which Ptolemy undertook; Hipparchus, as we have\r\nseen, having been destitute of the observations which such a process\r\nrequired. The determination of the Eccentricities in these cases\r\ninvolved some peculiarities which might not at first sight occur to\r\nthe reader. The **elcliptical motion of the planets takes place about\r\nthe sun; but Ptolemy considered their movements as altogether\r\nindependent of the sun, and referred them to the earth alone; and\r\nthus the apparent eccentricities which he had to account for, were\r\nthe compound result of the Eccentricity of the earth's orbit, and of\r\nthe proper eccentricity of the orbit of the Planet. He explained\r\nthis result by the received mechanism of an eccentric _Deferent_,\r\ncarrying an Epicycle; but the motion in the Deferent is uniform, not\r\nabout the centre of the circle, but about another point, the\r\n_Equant_. Without going further into detail, it may be sufficient to\r\nstate that, by a combination of Eccentrics and Epicycles, he did\r\naccount for the leading features of these motions; and by using his\r\nown observations, compared with more ancient ones (for instance,\r\nthose of Timocharis for Venus), he was able to determine the\r\nDimensions and Positions of the orbits.[114\\3] {176}\r\n\r\n[Note 114\\3: Ptolemy determined the Radius and the Periodic Time of\r\nhis two circles for each Planet in the following manner: For the\r\n_inferior_ Planets, that is, Mercury and Venus, he took the Radius of\r\nthe Deferent equal to the Radius of the Earth's orbit, and the Radius\r\nof the Epicycle equal to that of the Planet's orbit. For these\r\nPlanets, according to his assumption, the Periodic Time of the Planet\r\nin its Epicycle was to the Periodic Time of the Epicyclical Centre on\r\nthe Deferent, as the _synodical_ Revolution of the Planet to the\r\n_tropical_ Revolution of the Earth above the Sun. For the three\r\n_superior_ Planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the Radius of the\r\nDeferent was equal to the Radius of the Planet's orbit, and the Radius\r\nof the Epicycle was equal to the Radius of the Earth's orbit; the\r\nPeriodic Time on the Planet in its Epicycle was to the Periodic Time\r\nof the Epicyclical Centre on the Deferent, as the _synodical_\r\nRevolution of the Planet to the _tropical_ Revolution of the same\r\nPlanet.\r\n\r\nPtolemy might obviously have made the geometrical motions of all the\r\nPlanets correspond with the observations by one of these two modes\r\nof construction; but he appears to have adopted this double form of\r\nthe theory, in order that in the inferior, as well as in the\r\nsuperior Planets, he might give the smaller of the two Radii to the\r\nEpicycle: that is, in order that he might make the smaller circle\r\nmove round the larger, not _vice versâ_.--_Littrow's Notes._]\r\n\r\nI shall here close my account of the astronomical progress of the\r\nGreek School. My purpose is only to illustrate the principles on\r\nwhich the progress of science depends, and therefore I have not at\r\nall pretended to touch upon every part of the subject. Some portion\r\nof the ancient theories, as, for instance, the mode of accounting\r\nfor the motions of the moon and planets in latitude, are\r\nsufficiently analogous to what has been explained, not to require\r\nany more especial notice. Other parts of Greek astronomical\r\nknowledge, as, for instance, their acquaintance with refraction, did\r\nnot assume any clear or definite form, and can only be considered as\r\nthe prelude to modern discoveries on the same subject. And before we\r\ncan with propriety pass on to these, there is a long and remarkable,\r\nthough unproductive interval, of which some account must be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 8.--_Arabian Astronomy._\r\n\r\nTHE interval to which I have just alluded may be considered as\r\nextending from Ptolemy to Copernicus; we have no advance in Greek\r\nastronomy after the former; no signs of a revival of the power of\r\ndiscovery till the latter. During this interval of 1350\r\nyears,[115\\3] the principal cultivators of astronomy were the\r\nArabians, who adopted this science from the Greeks whom they\r\nconquered, and from whom the conquerors of western Europe again\r\nreceived back their treasure, when the love of science and the\r\ncapacity for it had been awakened in their minds. In the intervening\r\ntime, the precious deposit had undergone little change. The Arab\r\nastronomer had been the scrupulous but unprofitable servant, who\r\nkept his talent without apparent danger of loss, but also without\r\nprospect of increase. There is little in {177} Arabic literature\r\nwhich bears upon the _progress_ of astronomy; but as the little that\r\nthere is must be considered as a sequel to the Greek science, I\r\nshall notice one or two points before I treat of the stationary\r\nperiod in general.\r\n\r\n[Note 115\\3: Ptolemy died about A. D. 150. Copernicus was living\r\nA. D. 1500.]\r\n\r\nWhen the sceptre of western Asia had passed into the hands of the\r\nAbasside caliphs,[116\\3] Bagdad, \"the city of peace,\" rose to\r\nsplendor and refinement, and became the metropolis of science under\r\nthe successors of Almansor the Victorious, as Alexandria had been\r\nunder the successors of Alexander the Great. Astronomy attracted\r\npeculiarly the favor of the powerful as well as the learned; and\r\nalmost all the culture which was bestowed upon the science, appears\r\nto have had its source in the patronage, often also in the personal\r\nstudies, of Saracen princes. Under such encouragement, much was\r\ndone, in those scientific labors which money and rank can command.\r\nTranslations of Greek works were made, large instruments were\r\nerected, observers were maintained; and accordingly as observation\r\nshowed the defects and imperfection of the extant tables of the\r\ncelestial motions, new ones were constructed. Thus under Almansor,\r\nthe Grecian works of science were collected from all quarters, and\r\nmany of them translated into Arabic.[117\\3] The translation of the\r\n\"Megiste Syntaxis\" of Ptolemy, which thus became the Almagest, is\r\nascribed to Isaac ben Homain in this reign.\r\n\r\n[Note 116\\3: Gibbon, x. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Note 117\\3: Id. x. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the Arabian Astronomers comes half a century later.\r\nThis is Albategnius, as he is commonly called; or more exactly,\r\nMohammed ben Geber Albatani, the last appellation indicating that he\r\nwas born at Batan, a city of Mesopotamia.[118\\3] He was a Syrian\r\nprince, whose residence was at Aracte or Racha in Mesopotamia: a\r\npart of his observations were made at Antioch. His work still\r\nremains to us in Latin. \"After having read,\" he says, \"the Syntaxis\r\nof Ptolemy, and learnt the methods of calculation employed by the\r\nGreeks, his observations led him to conceive that some improvements\r\nmight be made in their results. He found it necessary to add to\r\nPtolemy's observations as Ptolemy had added to those of Abrachis\"\r\n(Hipparchus). He then published Tables of the motions of the sun,\r\nmoon, and planets, which long maintained a high reputation.\r\n\r\n[Note 118\\3: Del. _Astronomie du Moyen Age_, 4.]\r\n\r\nThese, however, did not prevent the publication of others. Under the\r\nCaliph Hakem (about A. D. 1000) Ebon Iounis published Tables of the\r\nSun, Moon, and Planets, which were hence called the _Hakemite\r\nTables_. Not long after, Arzachel of Toledo published the _Toletan_\r\n{178} Tables. In the 13th century, Nasir Eddin published Tables of\r\nthe Stars, dedicated to Ilchan, a Tartar prince, and hence termed\r\nthe _Ilchanic_ Tables. Two centuries later, Ulugh Beigh, the\r\ngrandson of Tamerlane, and prince of the countries beyond the Oxus,\r\nwas a zealous practical astronomer; and his Tables, which were\r\npublished in Europe by Hyde in 1665, are referred to as important\r\nauthority by modern astronomers. The series of Astronomical Tables\r\nwhich we have thus noticed, in which, however, many are omitted,\r\nleads us to the _Alphonsine_ Tables, which were put forth in 1488,\r\nand in succeeding years, under the auspices of Alphonso, king of\r\nCastile; and thus brings us to the verge of modern astronomy.\r\n\r\nFor all these Tables, the Ptolemaic hypotheses were employed; and,\r\nfor the most part, without alteration. The Arabs sometimes felt the\r\nextreme complexity and difficulty of the doctrine which they\r\nstudied; but their minds did not possess that kind of invention and\r\nenergy by which the philosophers of Europe, at a later period, won\r\ntheir way into a simpler and better system.\r\n\r\nThus Alpetragius states, in the outset of his \"Planetarum Theorica,\"\r\nthat he was at first astonished and stupefied with this complexity,\r\nbut that afterwards \"God was pleased to open to him the occult secret\r\nin the theory of his orbs, and to make known to him the truth of their\r\nessence and the rectitude of the quality of their motion.\" His system\r\nconsists, according to Delambre,[119\\3] in attributing to the planets\r\na spiral motion from east to west, an idea already refuted by Ptolemy.\r\nGeber of Seville criticises Ptolemy very severely,[120\\3] but without\r\nintroducing any essential alteration into his system. The Arabian\r\nobservations are in many cases valuable; both because they were made\r\nwith more skill and with better instruments than those of the Greeks;\r\nand also because they illustrate the permanence or variability of\r\nimportant elements, such as the obliquity of the ecliptic and the\r\ninclination of the moon's orbit.\r\n\r\n[Note 119\\3: Delambre, _M. A._ p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Note 120\\3: _M. A._ p. 180, &c.]\r\n\r\nWe must, however, notice one or two peculiar Arabian doctrines. The\r\nmost important of these is the discovery of the Motion of the Son's\r\nApogee by Albategnius. He found the Apogee to be in longitude 82\r\ndegrees; Ptolemy had placed it in longitude 65 degrees. The\r\ndifference of 17 degrees was beyond all limit of probable error of\r\ncalculation, though the process is not capable of great precision;\r\nand the inference of the Motion of the Apogee was so obvious, that\r\nwe cannot {179} agree with Delambre, in doubting or extenuating the\r\nclaim of Albategnius to this discovery, on the ground of his not\r\nhaving expressly stated it.\r\n\r\nIn detecting this motion, the Arabian astronomers reasoned rightly\r\nfrom facts well observed: they were not always so fortunate.\r\nArzachel, in the 11th century, found the apogee of the sun to be\r\nless advanced than Albategnius had found it, by some degrees; he\r\ninferred that it had receded in the intermediate time; but we now\r\nknow, from an acquaintance with its real rate of moving, that the\r\ntrue inference would have been, that Albategnius, whose method was\r\nless trustworthy than that of Arzachel, had made an error to the\r\namount of the difference thus arising. A curious, but utterly false\r\nhypothesis was founded on observations thus erroneously appreciated;\r\nnamely, the _Trepidation of the fixed stars_. Arzachel conceived\r\nthat a uniform Precession of the equinoctial points would not\r\naccount for the apparent changes of position of the stars, and that\r\nfor this purpose, it was necessary to conceive two circles of about\r\neight degrees radius described round the equinoctial points of the\r\nimmovable sphere, and to suppose the first points of Aries and Libra\r\nto describe the circumference of these circles in about 800 years.\r\nThis would produce, at one time a progression, and at another a\r\nregression, of the apparent equinoxes, and would moreover change the\r\nlatitude of the stars. Such a motion is entirely visionary; but the\r\ndoctrine made a sect among astronomers, and was adopted in the first\r\nedition of the Alphonsine Tables, though afterwards rejected.\r\n\r\nAn important exception to the general unprogressive character of\r\nArabian science has been pointed out recently by M. Sedillot.[121\\3]\r\nIt appears that Mohammed-Aboul Wefa-al-Bouzdjani, an Arabian\r\nastronomer of the tenth century, who resided at Cairo, and observed\r\nat Bagdad in 975, discovered a third inequality of the moon, in\r\naddition to the two expounded by Ptolemy, the Equation of the\r\nCentre, and the Evection. This third inequality, the _Variation_, is\r\nusually supposed to have been discovered by Tycho Brahe, six\r\ncenturies later. It is an inequality of the moon's motion, in virtue\r\nof which she moves quickest when she is at new or full, and slowest\r\nat the first and third quarter; in consequence of this, from the\r\nfirst quarter to the full, she is behind her mean place; at the\r\nfull, she does not differ from her mean place; from the full to the\r\nthird quarter, she is before her true {180} place; and so on; and\r\nthe greatest effect of the inequality is in the _octants_, or points\r\nhalf-way between the four quarters. In an Almagest of Aboul Wefa, a\r\npart of which exists in the Royal Library at Paris, after describing\r\nthe two inequalities of the moon, he has a Section ix., \"Of the\r\nThird Anomaly of the moon called _Muhazal_ or _Prosneusis_.\" He\r\nthere says, that taking cases when the moon was in apogee or\r\nperigee, and when, consequently, the effect of the two first\r\ninequalities vanishes, he found, _by observation of the moon_, when\r\nshe was nearly _in trine_ and _in sextile_ with the sun, that she\r\nwas a degree and a quarter from her calculated place. \"And hence,\"\r\nhe adds, \"I perceived that this anomaly exists independently of the\r\ntwo first: and this can only take place by a declination of the\r\ndiameter of the epicycle with respect to the centre of the zodiac.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 121\\3: Sedillot, Nouvelles Rech. sur l'Hist. de l'Astron. chez\r\nles Arabes. _Nouveau Journal Asiatique_. 1836.]\r\n\r\nWe may remark that we have here this inequality of the moon made out\r\nin a really philosophical manner; a residual quantity in the moon's\r\nlongitude being detected by observation, and the cases in which it\r\noccurs selected and grouped by an inductive effort of the mind. The\r\nadvance is not great; for Aboul Wefa appears only to have detected\r\nthe existence, and not to have fixed the law or the exact quantity\r\nof the inequality; but still it places the scientific capacity of\r\nthe Arabs in a more favorable point of view than any circumstance\r\nwith which we were previously acquainted.\r\n\r\nBut this discovery of Aboul Wefa appears to have excited no notice\r\namong his contemporaries and followers: at least it had been long\r\nquite forgotten when Tycho Brahe rediscovered the same lunar\r\ninequality. We can hardly help looking upon this circumstance as an\r\nevidence of a servility of intellect belonging to the Arabian\r\nperiod. The learned Arabians were so little in the habit of\r\nconsidering science as progressive, and looking with pride and\r\nconfidence at examples of its progress, that they had not the\r\ncourage to believe in a discovery which they themselves had made,\r\nand were dragged back by the chain of authority, even when they had\r\nadvanced beyond their Greek masters.\r\n\r\nAs the Arabians took the whole of their theory (with such slight\r\nexceptions as we have been noticing) from the Greeks, they took from\r\nthem also the mathematical processes by which the consequences of\r\nthe theory were obtained. Arithmetic and Trigonometry, two main\r\nbranches of these processes, received considerable improvements at\r\ntheir hands. In the former, especially, they rendered a service to\r\nthe world which it is difficult to estimate too highly, in\r\nabolishing the {181} cumbrous Sexagesimal Arithmetic of the Greeks,\r\nand introducing the notation by means of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, 0, which we now employ.[122\\3] These numerals appear to\r\nbe of Indian origin, as is acknowledged by the Arabs themselves; and\r\nthus form no exception to the sterility of the Arabian genius as to\r\ngreat scientific inventions. Another improvement, of a subordinate\r\nkind, but of great utility, was Arabian, being made by Albategnius.\r\nHe introduced into calculation the _sine_, or half-chord of the\r\ndouble arc, instead of the chord of the arc itself, which had been\r\nemployed by the Greek astronomers. There have been various\r\nconjectures concerning the origin of the word _sine_; the most\r\nprobable appears to be that _sinus_ is the Latin translation of the\r\nArabic word _gib_, which signifies a fold, the two halves of the\r\nchord being conceived to be folded together.\r\n\r\n[Note 122\\3: Mont. i. 376.]\r\n\r\nThe great obligation which Science owes to the Arabians, is to have\r\npreserved it during a period of darkness and desolation, so that\r\nEurope might receive it back again when the evil days were past. We\r\nshall see hereafter how differently the European intellect dealt\r\nwith this hereditary treasure when once recovered.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject, we may observe that Astronomy brought\r\nback, from her sojourn among the Arabs, a few terms which may still\r\nbe perceived in her phraseology. Such are the _zenith_, and the\r\nopposite imaginary point, the _nadir_;--the circles of the sphere\r\ntermed _almacantars_ and _azimuth_ circles. The _alidad_ of an\r\ninstrument is its index, which possesses an angular motion. Some of\r\nthe stars still retain their Arabic names; _Aldebran_, _Rigel_,\r\n_Fomalhaut_; many others were known by such appellations a little\r\nwhile ago. Perhaps the word _almanac_ is the most familiar vestige\r\nof the Arabian period of astronomy.\r\n\r\nIt is foreign to my purpose to note any efforts of the intellectual\r\nfaculties among other nations, which may have taken place\r\nindependently of the great system of progressive European culture,\r\nfrom which all our existing science is derived. Otherwise I might\r\nspeak of the astronomy of some of the Orientals, for example, the\r\nChinese, who are said, by Montucla (i. 465), to have discovered the\r\nfirst equation of the moon, and the proper motion of the fixed stars\r\n(the Precession), in the third century of our era. The Greeks had\r\nmade these discoveries 500 years earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{183}}\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE MIDDLE AGES;\r\nOR,\r\nVIEW OF THE STATIONARY PERIOD\r\nOF\r\nINDUCTIVE SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In vain, in vain! the all-composing hour\r\n  Resistless falls .  .  .  .\r\n  .  .  .  .  .\r\n  As one by one, at dread Medea's strain,\r\n  The sickening stars fade off th' ethereal plain;\r\n  As Argus' eyes, by Hermes' wand opprest,\r\n  Closed one by one to everlasting rest;\r\n  Thus at her felt approach and secret might,\r\n  Art after art goes out, and all is night.\r\n  See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,\r\n  Mountains of casuistry heaped on her head;\r\n  Philosophy, that reached the heavens before,\r\n  Shrinks to her hidden cause, and is no more.\r\n  Physic of Metaphysic begs defence,\r\n  And Metaphysic calls for aid to Sense:\r\n  See Mystery to Mathematics fly!\r\n  In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.\r\n\r\n           _Dunciad_, B. iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{185}}\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have now to consider more especially a long and barren period,\r\nwhich intervened between the scientific activity of ancient Greece\r\nand that of modern Europe; and which we may, therefore, call the\r\nStationary Period of Science. It would be to no purpose to enumerate\r\nthe various forms in which, during these times, men reproduced the\r\ndiscoveries of the inventive ages; or to trace in them the small\r\nsuccesses of Art, void of any principle of genuine Philosophy. Our\r\nobject requires rather that we should point out the general and\r\ndistinguishing features of the intellect and habits of those times.\r\nWe must endeavor to delineate the character of the Stationary\r\nPeriod, and, as far as possible, to analyze its defects and errors;\r\nand thus obtain some knowledge of the causes of its barrenness and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated, that real scientific progress requires\r\ndistinct general Ideas, applied to many special and certain Facts.\r\nIn the period of which we now have to speak, men's Ideas were\r\nobscured; their disposition to bring their general views into\r\naccordance with Facts was enfeebled. They were thus led to employ\r\nthemselves unprofitably, among indistinct and unreal notions. And\r\nthe evil of these tendencies was further inflamed by moral\r\npeculiarities in the character of those times;--by an abjectness of\r\nthought on the one hand, which could not help looking towards some\r\nintellectual superior, and by an impatience of dissent on the other.\r\nTo this must be added an enthusiastic temper, which, when introduced\r\ninto speculation, tends to subject the mind's operations to ideas\r\naltogether distorted and delusive.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of the stationary period, its obscurity of\r\nthought, its servility, its intolerant disposition, and its\r\nenthusiastic temper, will be treated of in the four following\r\nchapters, on the Indistinctness of Ideas, the Commentatorial Spirit,\r\nthe Dogmatism, and the Mysticism of the Middle Ages. {186}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nON THE INDISTINCTNESS OF IDEAS OF THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT firm and entire possession of certain clear and distinct\r\ngeneral ideas which is necessary to sound science, was the character\r\nof the minds of those among the ancients who created the several\r\nsciences which arose among them. It was indispensable that such\r\ninventors should have a luminous and steadfast apprehension of\r\ncertain general relations, such as those of space and number, order\r\nand cause; and should be able to apply these notions with perfect\r\nreadiness and precision to special facts and cases. It is necessary\r\nthat such scientific notions should be more definite and precise\r\nthan those which common language conveys; and in this state of\r\nunusual clearness, they must be so familiar to the philosopher, that\r\nthey are the language in which he thinks. The discoverer is thus led\r\nto doctrines which other men adopt and follow out, in proportion as\r\nthey seize the fundamental ideas, and become acquainted with the\r\nleading facts. Thus Hipparchus, conceiving clearly the motions and\r\ncombinations of motion which enter into his theory, saw that the\r\nrelative lengths of the seasons were sufficient data for determining\r\nthe form of the sun's orbit; thus Archimedes, possessing a steady\r\nnotion of mechanical pressure, was able, not only to deduce the\r\nproperties of the lever and of the centre of gravity, but also to\r\nsee the truth of those principles respecting the distribution of\r\npressure in fluids, on which the science of hydrostatics depends.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of such distinct ideas, the inductive sciences\r\nrise and flourish; with the decay and loss of such distinct ideas,\r\nthese sciences become stationary, languid, and retrograde. When men\r\nmerely repeat the terms of science, without attaching to them any\r\nclear conceptions;--when their apprehensions become vague and\r\ndim;--when they assent to scientific doctrines as a matter of\r\ntradition, rather than of conviction, on trust rather than on\r\nsight;--when science is considered as a collection of opinions,\r\nrather than a record of laws by which the universe is really\r\ngoverned;--it must inevitably happen, that men will lose their hold\r\non the knowledge which the great discoverers who preceded them have\r\nbrought to light. They are not able to push forwards the truths on\r\nwhich they lay so {187} feeble and irresolute a hand; probably they\r\ncannot even prevent their sliding back towards the obscurity from\r\nwhich they had been drawn, or from being lost altogether. Such\r\nindistinctness and vacillation of thought appear to have prevailed\r\nin the stationary period, and to be, in fact, intimately connected\r\nwith its stationary character. I shall point out some indications of\r\nthe intellectual peculiarity of which I speak.\r\n\r\n1. _Collections of Opinions._--The fact, that mere Collections of\r\nthe opinions of physical philosophers came to hold a prominent place\r\nin literature, already indicated a tendency to an indistinct and\r\nwandering apprehension of such opinions. I speak of such works as\r\nPlutarch's five Books \"on the Opinions of Philosophers,\" or the\r\nphysical opinions which Diogenes Laërtius gives in his \"Lives of the\r\nPhilosophers.\" At an earlier period still, books of this kind\r\nappear; as for instance, a large portion of Pliny's Natural History,\r\na work which has very appropriately been called the Encyclopædia of\r\nAntiquity; even Aristotle himself is much in the habit of\r\nenumerating the opinions of those who had preceded him. To present\r\nsuch statements as an important part of physical philosophy, shows\r\nan erroneous and loose apprehension of its nature. For the only\r\nproof of which its doctrines admit, is the possibility of applying\r\nthe general theory to each particular case; the authority of great\r\nmen, which in moral and practical matters may or must have its\r\nweight, is here of no force; and the technical precision of ideas\r\nwhich the terms of a sound physical theory usually demand, renders a\r\nmere statement of the doctrines very imperfectly intelligible to\r\nreaders familiar with common notions only. To dwell upon such\r\ncollections of opinions, therefore, both implies, and produces, in\r\nwriters and readers, an obscure and inadequate apprehension of the\r\nfull meaning of the doctrines thus collected; supposing there be\r\namong them any which really possess such a clearness, solidity, and\r\nreality, as to make them important in the history of science. Such\r\ndiversities of opinion convey no truth; such a multiplicity of\r\nstatements of what has been _said_, in no degree teaches us what\r\n_is_; such accumulations of indistinct notions, however vast and\r\nvaried, do not make up one distinct idea. On the contrary, the habit\r\nof dwelling upon the verbal expressions of the views of other\r\npersons, and of being content with such an apprehension of doctrines\r\nas a transient notice can give us, is fatal to firm and clear\r\nthought: it indicates wavering and feeble conceptions, which are\r\ninconsistent with speculation. {188}\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, consider the prevalence of Collections of the\r\nkind just referred to, as indicating a deficiency of philosophical\r\ntalent in the ages now under review. As evidence of the same\r\ncharacter, we may add the long train of publishers of Abstracts,\r\nEpitomes, Bibliographical Notices, and similar writers. All such\r\nwriters are worthless for all purposes of _science_, and their\r\nlabors may be considered as dead works; they have in them no\r\nprinciple of philosophical vitality; they draw their origin and\r\nnutriment from the death of true physical knowledge; and resemble\r\nthe swarms of insects that are born from the perishing carcass of\r\nsome noble animal.\r\n\r\n2. _Indistinctness of Ideas in Mechanics._--But the indistinctness\r\nof thought which is so fatal a feature in the intellect of the\r\nstationary period, may be traced more directly in the works, even of\r\nthe best authors, of those times. We find that they did not retain\r\nsteadily the ideas on which the scientific success of the previous\r\nperiod had depended. For instance, it is a remarkable circumstance\r\nin the history of the science of Mechanics, that it did not make any\r\nadvance from the time of Archimedes to that of Stevinus and Galileo.\r\nArchimedes had established the doctrine of the lever; several\r\npersons tried, in the intermediate time, to prove the property of\r\nthe inclined plane, and none of them succeeded. But let us look to\r\nthe attempts; for example, that of Pappus, in the eighth Book of his\r\nMathematical Collections, and we may see the reason of the failure.\r\nHis Problem shows, in the very terms in which it is propounded, the\r\nwant of a clear apprehension of the subject. \"Having given the power\r\nwhich will draw a given weight along the horizontal plane, to find\r\nthe additional power which will draw the same weight along a given\r\ninclined plane.\" This is proposed without previously defining how\r\nPowers, producing such effects, are to be measured; and as if the\r\nspeed with which the body were drawn, and the nature of the surface\r\nof the plane, were of no consequence. The proper elementary Problem\r\nis, To find the force which will _support_ a body on a smooth\r\ninclined plane; and no doubt the solution of Pappus has more\r\nreference to this problem than to his own. His reasoning is,\r\nhowever, totally at variance with mechanical ideas on any view of\r\nthe problem. He supposes the weight to be formed into a sphere; and\r\nthis sphere being placed in contact with the inclined plane, he\r\nassumes that the effect will be the same as if the weight were\r\nsupported on a horizontal lever, the fulcrum being the point of\r\ncontact of the sphere with the plane, and the power acting at the\r\ncircumference of the sphere. Such an assumption implies an entire\r\n{189} absence of those distinct ideas of force and mechanical\r\npressure, on which our perception of the identity or difference of\r\ndifferent modes of action must depend;--of those ideas by the help\r\nof which Archimedes had been able to demonstrate the properties of\r\nthe lever, and Stevinus afterwards discovered the true solution of\r\nthe problem of the inclined plane. The motive to Pappus's assumption\r\nwas probably no more than this;--he perceived that the additional\r\npower, which he thus obtained, vanished when the plane became\r\nhorizontal, and increased as the inclination became greater. Thus\r\nhis views were vague; he had no clear conception of mechanical\r\naction, and he tried a geometrical conjecture. This is not the way\r\nto real knowledge.\r\n\r\nPappus (who lived about A. D. 400) was one of the best\r\nmathematicians of the Alexandrian school; and, on subjects where his\r\nideas were so indistinct, it is not likely that any much clearer\r\nwere to be found in the minds of his contemporaries. Accordingly, on\r\nall subjects of speculative mechanics, there appears to have been an\r\nentire confusion and obscurity of thought till modern times. Men's\r\nminds were busy in endeavoring to systematize the distinctions and\r\nsubtleties of the Aristotelian school, concerning Motion and Power;\r\nand, being thus employed among doctrines in which there was involved\r\nno definite meaning capable of real exemplification, they, of\r\ncourse, could not acquire sound physical knowledge. We have already\r\nseen that the physical opinions of Aristotle, even as they came from\r\nhim, had no proper scientific precision. His followers, in their\r\nendeavors to perfect and develop his statements, never attempted to\r\nintroduce clearer ideas than those of their master; and as they\r\nnever referred, in any steady manner, to facts, the vagueness of\r\ntheir notions was not corrected by any collision with observation.\r\nThe physical doctrines which they extracted from Aristotle were, in\r\nthe course of time, built up into a regular system; and though these\r\ndoctrines could not be followed into a practical application without\r\nintroducing distinctions and changes, such as deprived the terms of\r\nall steady signification, the dogmas continued to be repeated, till\r\nthe world was persuaded that they were self-evident; and when, at a\r\nlater period, experimental philosophers, such as Galileo and Boyle,\r\nventured to contradict these current maxims, their new principles\r\nsounded in men's ears as strange as they now sound familiar. Thus\r\nBoyle promulgated his opinions on the mechanics of fluids, as\r\n\"Hydrostatical _Paradoxes_, proved and illustrated by experiments.\"\r\nAnd the opinions which he there opposes, are those which the\r\nAristotelian philosophers habitually propounded as certain {190} and\r\nindisputable; such, for instance, as that \"in fluids the upper parts\r\ndo not gravitate on the lower;\" that \"a lighter fluid will not\r\ngravitate on a heavier;\" that \"levity is a positive quality of\r\nbodies as well as gravity.\" So long as these assertions were left\r\nuncontested and untried, men heard and repeated them, without\r\nperceiving the incongruities which they involved: and thus they long\r\nevaded refutation, amid the vague notions and undoubting habits of\r\nthe stationary period. But when the controversies of Galileo's time\r\nhad made men think with more acuteness and steadiness, it was\r\ndiscovered that many of these doctrines were inconsistent with\r\nthemselves, as well as with experiment. We have an example of the\r\nconfusion of thought to which the Aristotelians were liable, in\r\ntheir doctrine concerning falling bodies. \"Heavy bodies,\" said they,\r\n\"must fall quicker than light ones; for weight is the cause of their\r\nfall, and the weight of the greater bodies is greater.\" They did not\r\nperceive that, if they considered the weight of the body as a power\r\nacting to produce motion, they must consider the body itself as\r\noffering a resistance to motion; and that the effect must depend on\r\nthe proportion of the power to the resistance; in short, they had no\r\nclear idea of _accelerating force_. This defect runs through all\r\ntheir mechanical speculations, and renders them entirely valueless.\r\n\r\nWe may exemplify the same confusion of thought on mechanical\r\nsubjects in writers of a less technical character. Thus, if men had\r\nany distinct idea of mechanical action, they could not have accepted\r\nfor a moment the fable of the Echineis or Remora, a little fish\r\nwhich was said to be able to stop a large ship merely by sticking to\r\nit.[1\\4] Lucan refers to this legend in a poetical manner, and\r\nnotices this creature only in bringing together a collection of\r\nmonstrosities; but Pliny relates the tale gravely, and moralizes\r\nupon it after his manner. \"What,\" he cries,[2\\4] \"is more violent\r\nthan the sea and the winds? what a greater work of art than a ship?\r\nYet one little fish (the Echineis) can hold back all these when they\r\nall strain the same way. The winds may {191} blow, the waves may\r\nrage; but this small creature controls their fury, and stops a\r\nvessel, when chains and anchors would not hold it: and this it does,\r\nnot by hard labor, but merely by adhering to it. Alas, for human\r\nvanity! when the turreted ships which man has built, that he may\r\nfight from castle-walls, at sea as well as at land, are held captive\r\nand motionless by a fish a foot and a half long! Such a fish is said\r\nto have stopped the admiral's ship at the battle of Actium, and\r\ncompelled Antony to go into another. And in our own memory, one of\r\nthese animals held fast the ship of Caius, the emperor, when he was\r\nsailing from Astura to Antium. The stopping of this ship, when all\r\nthe rest of the fleet went on, caused surprise; but this did not\r\nlast long, for some of the men jumped into the water to look for the\r\nfish, and found it sticking to the rudder; they showed it to Caius,\r\nwho was indignant that this animal should interpose its prohibition\r\nto his progress, when impelled by four hundred rowers. It was like a\r\nslug; and had no power, after it was taken into the ship.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\4: Lucan is describing one of the poetical compounds\r\nproduced in incantations.\r\n  Huc quicquid fœtu genuit Natura sinistro\r\n  Miscetur: non spuma canum quibus unda timori est,\r\n  Viscera non lyncis, non duræ nodus hyænæ\r\n  Defuit, et cervi pasti serpente medullæ;\r\n  In mediis _Echineis_ aquis, oculique draconum.\r\n      Etc.               _Pharsalia_, **vi. 670.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\4: Plin. _Hist. N._ xxxii. 5.]\r\n\r\nA very little advance in the power of thinking clearly on the force\r\nwhich it exerted in pulling, would have enabled the Romans to see\r\nthat the ship and its rowers must pull the adhering fish by the hold\r\nthe oars had upon the water; and that, except the fish had a hold\r\nequally strong on some external body, it could not resist this force.\r\n\r\n3. _Indistinctness of Ideas shown in Architecture._--Perhaps it may\r\nserve to illustrate still further the extent to which, under the\r\nRoman empire, men's notions of mechanical relations became faint,\r\nwavered, and disappeared, if we observe the change which took place\r\nin architecture. All architecture, to possess genuine beauty, must\r\nbe mechanically consistent. The decorative members must represent a\r\nstructure which has in it a principle of support and stability. Thus\r\nthe Grecian colonnade was a straight horizontal beam, resting on\r\nvertical props; and the pediment imitated a frame like a roof, where\r\noppositely inclined beams support each other. These forms of\r\nbuilding were, therefore, proper models of art, because they implied\r\nsupporting forces. But to be content with colonnades and pediments,\r\nwhich, though they imitated the forms of the Grecian ones, were\r\ndestitute of their mechanical truth, belonged to the decline of art;\r\nand showed that men had lost the idea of force, and retained only\r\nthat of shape. Yet this was what the architects of the Roman empire\r\ndid. Under their hands, the pediment was severed at its vertex, and\r\ndivided into separate halves, so that it was no longer a mechanical\r\npossibility. The entablature no longer lay straight from pillar to\r\npillar, but, projecting over each {192} column, turned back to the\r\nwall, and adhered to it in the intervening space. The splendid\r\nremains of Palmyra, Balbec, Petra, exhibit endless examples of this\r\nkind of perverse inventiveness; and show us, very instructively, how\r\nthe decay of art and of science alike accompany this indistinctness\r\nof ideas which we are now endeavoring to illustrate.\r\n\r\n4. _Indistinctness of Ideas in Astronomy._--Returning to the\r\nsciences, it may be supposed, at first sight, that, with regard to\r\nastronomy, we have not the same ground for charging the stationary\r\nperiod with indistinctness of ideas on that subject, since they were\r\nable to acquire and verify, and, in some measure, to apply, the\r\ndoctrines previously established. And, undoubtedly, it must be\r\nconfessed that men's notions of the relations of space and number\r\nare never very indistinct. It appears to be impossible for these\r\nchains of elementary perception ever to be much entangled. The later\r\nGreeks, the Arabians, and the earliest modern astronomers, must have\r\nconceived the hypotheses of the Ptolemaic system with tolerable\r\ncompleteness. And yet, we may assert, that during the stationary\r\nperiod, men did not possess the notions, even of space and number,\r\nin that vivid and vigorous manner which enables them to discover new\r\ntruths. If they had perceived distinctly that the astronomical\r\ntheorist had merely to do with _relative_ motions, they must have\r\nbeen led to see the possibility, at least, of the Copernican system;\r\nas the Greeks, at an earlier period, had already perceived it. We\r\nfind no trace of this. Indeed, the mode in which the Arabian\r\nmathematicians present the solutions of their problems, does not\r\nindicate that clear apprehension of the relations of space, and that\r\ndelight in the contemplation of them, which the Greek geometrical\r\nspeculations imply. The Arabs are in the habit of giving conclusions\r\nwithout demonstrations, precepts without the investigations by which\r\nthey are obtained; as if their main object were practical rather\r\nthan speculative,--the calculation of results rather than the\r\nexposition of theory. Delambre[3\\4] has been obliged to exercise\r\ngreat ingenuity, in order to discover the method by which Ibn Iounis\r\nproved his solution of certain difficult problems.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\4: Delamb. _M. A._ p. 125-8.]\r\n\r\n5. _Indistinctness of Ideas shown by Skeptics._--The same\r\nunsteadiness of ideas which prevents men from obtaining clear views,\r\nand steady and just convictions, on special subjects, may lead them\r\nto despair of or deny the possibility of acquiring certainty at all,\r\nand may thus make them skeptics with regard to all knowledge. Such\r\nskeptics {193} are themselves men of indistinct views, for they\r\ncould not otherwise avoid assenting to the demonstrated truths of\r\nscience; and, so far as they may be taken as specimens of their\r\ncontemporaries, they prove that indistinct ideas prevail in the age\r\nin which they appear. In the stationary period, moreover, the\r\nindefinite speculations and unprofitable subtleties of the schools\r\nmight further impel a man of bold and acute mind to this universal\r\nskepticism, because they offered nothing which could fix or satisfy\r\nhim. And thus the skeptical spirit may deserve our notice as\r\nindicative of the defects of a system of doctrine too feeble in\r\ndemonstration to control such resistance.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these philosophical skeptics is Sextus\r\nEmpiricus; so called, from his belonging to that medical sect which\r\nwas termed the _empirical_, in contradistinction to the _rational_\r\nand _methodical_ sects. His works contain a series of treatises,\r\ndirected against all the divisions of the science of his time. He\r\nhas chapters against the Geometers, against the Arithmeticians,\r\nagainst the Astrologers, against the Musicians, as well as against\r\nGrammarians, Rhetoricians, and Logicians; and, in short, as a modern\r\nwriter has said, his skepticism is employed as a sort of frame-work\r\nwhich embraces an encyclopedical view of human knowledge. It must be\r\nstated, however, that his objections are rather to the metaphysical\r\ngrounds, than to the details of the sciences; he rather denies the\r\npossibility of speculative truth in general, than the experimental\r\ntruths which had been then obtained. Thus his objections to geometry\r\nand arithmetic are founded on abstract cavils concerning the nature\r\nof points, letters, unities, &c. And when he comes to speak against\r\nastrology, he says, \"I am not going to consider that perfect science\r\nwhich rests upon geometry and arithmetic; for I have already shown\r\nthe weakness of those sciences: nor that faculty of prediction (of\r\nthe motions of the heavens) which belongs to the pupils of Eudoxus,\r\nand Hipparchus, and the rest, which some call Astronomy; for that is\r\nan observation of phenomena, like agriculture or navigation: but\r\nagainst the Art of Prediction from the time of birth, which the\r\nChaldeans exercise.\" Sextus, therefore, though a skeptic by\r\nprofession, was not insensible to the difference between\r\nexperimental knowledge and mystical dogmas, though even the former\r\nhad nothing which excited his admiration.\r\n\r\nThe skepticism which denies the evidence of the truths of which the\r\nbest established physical sciences consist, must necessarily involve\r\na very indistinct apprehension of those truths; for such truths,\r\nproperly exhibited, contain their own evidence, and are the best\r\nantidote {194} to this skepticism. But an incredulity or contempt\r\ntowards the asserted truths of physical science may arise also from\r\nthe attention being mainly directed to the certainty and importance\r\nof religious truths. A veneration for revealed religion may thus\r\nassume the aspect of a skepticism with regard to natural knowledge.\r\nSuch appears to be the case with Algazel or Algezeli, who is adduced\r\nby Degerando[4\\4] as an example of an Arabian skeptic. He was a\r\ncelebrated teacher at Bagdad in the eleventh century, and he\r\ndeclared himself the enemy, not only of the mixed Peripatetic and\r\nPlatonic philosophy of the time, but of Aristotle himself. His work\r\nentitled _The Destructions of the Philosophers_, is known to us by\r\nthe refutation of it which Averrhoes published, under the title of\r\n_Destruction of Algazel's Destructions of the Philosophers_. It\r\nappears that he contested the fundamental principles both of the\r\nPlatonic and of the Aristotelian schools, and denied the possibility\r\nof a known connection between cause and effect; thus making a\r\nprelude, says Degerando, to the celebrated argumentation of Hume.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\4: Degerando, _Hist. Comp. de Systèmes_, iv. 224.]\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] Since the publication of my first edition, an account of\r\nAlgazel or Algazzali and his works has been published under the\r\ntitle of _Essai sur les Ecoles Philosophiques chez les Arabes, et\r\nnotamment sur la Doctrine d'Algazzali_, par August Schmölders.\r\nParis. 1842. From this book it appears that Degerando's account of\r\nAlgazzali is correct, when he says[5\\4] that \"his skepticism seems\r\nto have essentially for its object to destroy all systems of merely\r\nrational theology, in order to open an indefinite career, not only\r\nto faith guided by revelation, but also to the free exaltation of a\r\nmystical enthusiasm.\" It is remarked by Dr. Schmölders, following M.\r\nde Hammer-Purgstall, that the title of the work referred to in the\r\ntext ought rather to be _Mutual Refutation of the Philosophers_: and\r\nthat its object is to show that Philosophy consists of a mass of\r\nsystems, each of which overturns the others. The work of Algazzali\r\nwhich Dr. Schmölders has published, _On the Errors of Sects, &c._,\r\ncontains a kind of autobiographical account of the way in which the\r\nauthor was led to his views. He does not reject the truths of\r\nscience, but he condemns the mental habits which are caused by\r\nlaying too much stress upon science. Religious men, he says, are, by\r\nsuch a course, led to reject all science, even what relates to\r\neclipses of the moon and sun; and men of science are led to hate\r\nreligion.[6\\4] {195}\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\4: _Hist. Comp._ iv. p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\4: _Essai_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n6. _Neglect of Physical Reasoning in Christendom._--If the Arabians,\r\nwho, during the ages of which we are speaking, were the most eminent\r\ncultivators of science, entertained only such comparatively feeble\r\nand servile notions of its doctrines, it will easily be supposed,\r\nthat in the Christendom of that period, where physical knowledge was\r\ncomparatively neglected, there was still less distinctness and\r\nvividness in the prevalent ideas on such subjects. Indeed, during a\r\nconsiderable period of the history of the Christian Church, and by\r\nmany of its principal authorities, the study of natural philosophy\r\nwas not only disregarded but discommended. The great practical\r\ndoctrines which were presented to men's minds, and the serious\r\ntasks, of the regulation of the will and affections, which religion\r\nimpressed upon them, made inquiries of mere curiosity seem to be a\r\nreprehensible misapplication of human powers; and many of the\r\nfathers of the Church revived, in a still more peremptory form, the\r\nopinion of Socrates, that the only valuable philosophy is that which\r\nteaches us our moral duties and religious hopes.[7\\4] Thus Eusebius\r\nsays,[8\\4] \"It is not through ignorance of the things admired by\r\nthem, but through contempt of their useless labor, that we think\r\nlittle of these matters, turning our souls to the exercise of better\r\nthings.\" When the thoughts were thus intentionally averted from\r\nthose ideas which natural philosophy involves, the ideas inevitably\r\nbecame very indistinct in their minds; and they could not conceive\r\nthat any other persons could find, on such subjects, grounds of\r\nclear conviction and certainty. They held the whole of their\r\nphilosophy to be, as Lactantius[9\\4] asserts it to be, \"empty and\r\nfalse.\" \"To search,\" says he, \"for the causes of natural things; to\r\ninquire whether the sun be as large as he seems, whether the moon is\r\nconvex or concave, whether the stars are fixed in the sky or float\r\nfreely in the air; of what size and of what material are the\r\nheavens; whether they be at rest or in motion; what is the magnitude\r\nof the earth; on what foundations it is suspended and balanced;--to\r\ndispute and conjecture on such matters, is just as if we chose to\r\ndiscuss what we think of a city in a remote country, of which we\r\nnever heard but the name.\" It is impossible to express more forcibly\r\nthat absence of any definite notions on physical subjects which led\r\nto this tone of thought.\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\4: Brucker, iii. 317.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\4: _Præp. Ev._ xv. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\4: _Inst._ 1. iii. init.]\r\n\r\n7. _Question of Antipodes._--With such habits of thought, we are not\r\nto be surprised if the relations resulting from the best established\r\ntheories were apprehended in an imperfect and incongruous manner.\r\n{196} We have some remarkable examples of this; and a very notable\r\none is the celebrated question of the existence of _Antipodes_, or\r\npersons inhabiting the opposite side of the globe of the earth, and\r\nconsequently having the soles of their feet directly opposed to\r\nours. The doctrine of the globular form of the earth results, as we\r\nhave seen, by a geometrical necessity, from a clear conception of\r\nthe various points of knowledge which we obtain, bearing upon that\r\nsubject. This doctrine was held distinctly by the Greeks; it was\r\nadopted by all astronomers, Arabian and European, who followed them;\r\nand was, in fact, an inevitable part of every system of astronomy\r\nwhich gave a consistent and intelligible representation of\r\nphenomena. But those who did not call before their minds any\r\ndistinct representation at all, and who referred the whole question\r\nto other relations than those of space, might still deny this\r\ndoctrine; and they did so. The existence of inhabitants on the\r\nopposite side of the terraqueous globe, was a fact of which\r\nexperience alone could teach the truth or falsehood; but the\r\nreligious relations, which extend alike to all mankind, were\r\nsupposed to give the Christian philosopher grounds for deciding\r\nagainst the possibility of such a race of men. Lactantius,[10\\4] in\r\nthe fourth century, argues this matter in a way very illustrative of\r\nthat impatience of such speculations, and consequent confusion of\r\nthought, which we have mentioned. \"Is it possible,\" he says, \"that\r\nmen can be so absurd as to believe that the crops and trees on the\r\nother side of the earth hang downwards, and that men there have\r\ntheir feet higher than their heads? If you ask of them how they\r\ndefend these monstrosities--how things do not fall away from the\r\nearth on that side--they reply, that the nature of things is such\r\nthat heavy bodies tend towards the centre, like the spokes of a\r\nwheel, while light bodies, as clouds, smoke, fire, tend from the\r\ncentre towards the heavens on all sides. Now I am really at a loss\r\nwhat to say of those who, when they have once gone wrong, steadily\r\npersevere in their folly, and defend one absurd opinion by another.\"\r\nIt is obvious that so long as the writer refused to admit into his\r\nthoughts the fundamental conception of their theory, he must needs\r\nbe at a loss what to say to their arguments without being on that\r\naccount in any degree convinced of their doctrines.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\4: _Inst._ 1. iii. 23.]\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century, indeed, in the reign of Justinian, we find a\r\nwriter (Cosmas Indicopleustes[11\\4]) who does not rest in this\r\nobscurity of {197} representation; but in this case, the\r\ndistinctness of the pictures only serves to show his want of any\r\nclear conception as to what suppositions would explain the\r\nphenomena. He describes the earth as an oblong floor, surrounded by\r\nupright walls, and covered by a vault, below which the heavenly\r\nbodies perform their revolutions, going round a certain high\r\nmountain, which occupies the northern parts of the earth, and makes\r\nnight by intercepting the light of the sun. In Augustin[12\\4] (who\r\nflourished A. D. 400) the opinion is treated on other grounds; and\r\nwithout denying the globular form of the earth, it is asserted that\r\nthere are no inhabitants on the opposite side, because no such race\r\nis recorded by Scripture among the descendants of Adam.[13\\4]\r\nConsiderations of the same kind operated in the well-known instance\r\nof Virgil, Bishop of Salzburg, in the eighth century. When he was\r\nreported to Boniface, Archbishop of Mentz, as holding the existence\r\nof Antipodes, the prelate was shocked at the assumption, as it\r\nseemed to him, of a world of human beings, out of the reach of the\r\nconditions of salvation; and application was made to Pope Zachary\r\nfor a censure of the holder of this dangerous doctrine. It does not,\r\nhowever, appear that this led to any severity; and the story of the\r\ndeposition of Virgil from his bishopric, which is circulated by\r\nKepler and by more modern writers, is undoubtedly altogether false.\r\nThe same scruples continued to prevail among Christian writers to a\r\nlater period; and Tostatus[14\\4] notes the opinion of the rotundity\r\nof the earth as an \"unsafe\" doctrine, only a few years before\r\nColumbus visited the other hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\4: Montfaucon, _Collectio Nova Patrum_, t. ii. p. 113.\r\nCosmas Indicopleustes. Christianorum Opiniones de Mundo, sive\r\nTopographia Christiana.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\4: _Civ. D._ xvi. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\4: It appears, however, that scriptural arguments were\r\nfound on the other side. St. Jerome says (_Comm. in Ezech._ i. 6),\r\nspeaking of the two cherubims with four faces, seen by the prophet,\r\nand the interpretation of the vision: \"Alii vero qui philosophorum\r\nstultam sequuntur sapientiam, duo hemispheria in duobus templi\r\ncherubim, nos et antipodes, quasi supinos et cadentes homines\r\nsuspicantur.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\4: Montfauc. _Patr._ t. ii.]\r\n\r\n8. _Intellectual Condition of the Religious Orders._--It must be\r\nrecollected, however, that though these were the views and tenets of\r\nmany religious writers, and though they may be taken as indications of\r\nthe prevalent and characteristic temper of the times of which we\r\nspeak, they never were universal. Such a confusion of thought affects\r\nthe minds of many persons, even in the most enlightened times; and in\r\nwhat we call the Dark Ages, though clear views on such subjects might\r\nbe more rare, those who gave their minds to science, entertained the\r\ntrue opinion of the figure of the earth. Thus Boëthius[15\\4] (in the\r\nsixth century) urges the smallness of the globe of the earth, {198}\r\ncompared with the heavens, as a reason to repress our love of glory.\r\nThis work, it will be recollected, was translated into the Anglo-Saxon\r\nby our own Alfred. It was also commented on by Bede, who, in what he\r\nsays on this passage, assents to the doctrine, and shows an\r\nacquaintance with Ptolemy and his commentators, both Arabian and\r\nGreek. Gerbert, in the tenth century, went from France to Spain to\r\nstudy astronomy with the Arabians, and soon surpassed his masters. He\r\nis reported to have fabricated clocks, and an astrolabe of peculiar\r\nconstruction. Gerbert afterwards (in the last year of the first\r\nthousand from the birth of Christ) became pope, by the name of\r\nSylvester II. Among other cultivators of the sciences, some of whom,\r\nfrom their proficiency, must have possessed with considerable\r\nclearness and steadiness the elementary ideas on which it depends, we\r\nmay here mention, after Montucla,[16\\4] Adelbold, whose work On the\r\nSphere was addressed to Pope Sylvester, and whose geometrical\r\nreasonings are, according to Montucla,[17\\4] vague and chimerical;\r\nHermann Contractus, a monk of St Gall, who, in 1050, published\r\nastronomical works; William of Hirsaugen, who followed his example in\r\n1080; Robert of Lorraine, who was made Bishop of Hereford by William\r\nthe Conqueror, in consequence of his astronomical knowledge. In the\r\nnext century, Adelhard Goth, an Englishman, travelled among the Arabs\r\nfor purposes of study, as Gerbert had done in the preceding age; and\r\non his return, translated the Elements of Euclid, which he had brought\r\nfrom Spain or Egypt. Robert Grostête, Bishop of Lincoln, was the\r\nauthor of an Epitome on the Sphere; Roger Bacon, in his youth the\r\ncontemporary of Robert, and of his brother Adam Marsh, praises very\r\nhighly their knowledge in mathematics.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\4: Boëthius, _Cons._ ii. pr. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\4: Mont. i. 502.]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\4: Ib. i. 503.]\r\n\r\n\"And here,\" says the French historian of mathematics, whom I have\r\nfollowed in the preceding relation, \"it is impossible not to reflect\r\nthat all those men who, if they did not augment the treasure of the\r\nsciences, at least served to transmit it, were monks, or had been\r\nsuch originally. Convents were, during these stormy ages, the asylum\r\nof sciences and letters. Without these religious men, who, in the\r\nsilence of their monasteries, occupied themselves in transcribing,\r\nin studying, and in imitating the works of the ancients, well or\r\nill, those works would have perished; perhaps not one of them would\r\nhave come down to us. The thread which connects us with the Greeks\r\nand Romans would have been snapt asunder; the precious productions\r\nof {199} ancient literature would no more exist for us, than the\r\nworks, if any there were, published before the catastrophe that\r\nannihilated that highly scientific nation, which, according to\r\nBailly, existed in remote ages in the centre of Tartary, or at the\r\nroots of Caucasus. In the sciences we should have had all to create;\r\nand at the moment when the human mind should have emerged from its\r\nstupor and shaken off its slumbers, we should have been no more\r\nadvanced than the Greeks were after the taking of Troy.\" He adds,\r\nthat this consideration inspires feelings towards the religious\r\norders very different from those which, when he wrote, were\r\nprevalent among his countrymen.\r\n\r\nExcept so far as their religious opinions interfered, it was natural\r\nthat men who lived a life of quiet and study, and were necessarily\r\nin a great measure removed from the absorbing and blinding interests\r\nwith which practical life occupies the thoughts, should cultivate\r\nscience more successfully than others, precisely because their ideas\r\non speculative subjects had time and opportunity to become clear and\r\nsteady. The studies which were cultivated under the name of the\r\nSeven Liberal Arts, necessarily tended to favor this effect. The\r\n_Trivium_,[18\\4] indeed, which consisted of Grammar, Logic, and\r\nRhetoric, had no direct bearing upon those ideas with which physical\r\nscience is concerned; but the _Quadrivium_, Music, Arithmetic,\r\nGeometry, Astronomy, could not be pursued with any attention,\r\nwithout a corresponding improvement of the mind for the purposes of\r\nsound knowledge.[19\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\4: Bruck. iii. 597.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\4: Roger Bacon, in his _Specula Mathematica_, cap. i., says\r\n\"Harum scientiarum porta et clavis est mathematica, quam sancti a\r\nprincipio mundi invenerunt, etc. Cujus negligentia _jam per triginta\r\nvel quadraginta annos_ destruxit totum studium Latinorum.\" I do not\r\nknow on what occasion this neglect took place.]\r\n\r\n9. _Popular Opinions._--That, even in the best intellects, something\r\nwas wanting to fit them for scientific progress and discovery, is\r\nobvious from the fact that science was so long absolutely\r\nstationary. And I have endeavored to show that one part of this\r\ndeficiency was the want of the requisite clearness and vigor of the\r\nfundamental scientific ideas. If these were wanting, even in the\r\nmost powerful and most cultivated minds, we may easily conceive that\r\nstill greater confusion and obscurity prevailed in the common class\r\nof mankind. They actually adopted the belief, however crude and\r\ninconsistent, that the form of the earth and heavens really is what\r\nat any place it appears to be; that the earth is flat, and the\r\nwaters of the sky sustained above a material floor, through which in\r\nshowers they descend. Yet the true doctrines of {200} astronomy\r\nappear to have had some popular circulation. For instance, a French\r\npoem of the time of Edward the Second, called _Ymage du Monde_,\r\ncontains a metrical account of the earth and heavens, according to\r\nthe Ptolemaic views; and in a manuscript of this poem, preserved in\r\nthe library of the University of Cambridge, there are\r\nrepresentations, in accordance with the text, of a spherical earth,\r\nwith men standing upright upon it on every side; and by way of\r\nillustrating the tendency of all things to the centre, perforations\r\nof the earth, entirely through its mass, are described and depicted;\r\nand figures are exhibited dropping balls down each of these holes,\r\nso as to meet in the interior. And, as bearing upon the perplexity\r\nwhich attends the motions of _up_ and _down_, when applied to the\r\nglobular earth, and the change of the direction of gravity which\r\nwould occur in passing the centre, the readers of Dante will\r\nrecollect the extraordinary manner in which the poet and his guide\r\nemerge from the bottom of the abyss; and the explanation which\r\nVirgil imparts to him of what he there sees. After they have crept\r\nthrough the aperture in which Lucifer is placed, the poet says,\r\n    \"Io levai gli occhi e credetti vedere\r\n  Lucifero com' io l' avea lasciato,\r\n  E vidile le gambe in su tenere.\"\r\n  . . . . . \"Questi come è fitto\r\n  Si sottasopra!\" . . . . .\r\n  \"Quando mi volsi, tu passast' il punto\r\n  Al qual si traggon d' ogni parte i pesi.\"\r\n          _Inferno_, xxxiv.\r\n\r\n  . . . . . \"I raised mine eyes,\r\n  Believing that I Lucifer should see\r\n  Where he was lately left, but saw him now\r\n  With legs held upward.\" . . . . .\r\n  \"How standeth he in posture thus reversed?\"\r\n  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n  \"Thou wast on the other side so long as I\r\n  Descended; when I turned, thou didst o'erpass\r\n  That point to which from every part is dragged\r\n  All heavy substance.\"           CARY.\r\n\r\nThis is more philosophical than Milton's representation, in a more\r\nscientific age, of Uriel sliding to the earth on a sunbeam, and\r\nsliding back again, when the sun had sunk below the horizon.\r\n  . . . . . \"Uriel to his charge\r\n  Returned on that bright beam whose point now raised,\r\n  Bore him slope downward to the sun, now fallen\r\n  Beneath the Azores.\"            _Par. Lost_, B. iv.  {201}\r\n\r\nThe philosophical notions of up and down are too much at variance\r\nwith the obvious suggestions of our senses, to be held steadily and\r\njustly by minds undisciplined in science. Perhaps it was some\r\nmisunderstood statement of the curved surface of the ocean, which\r\ngave rise to the tradition of there being a part of the sea directly\r\nover the earth, from which at times an object has been known to fall\r\nor an anchor to be let down. Even such whimsical fancies are not\r\nwithout instruction, and may serve to show the reader what that\r\nvagueness and obscurity of ideas is, of which I have been\r\nendeavoring to trace the prevalence in the dark ages.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to another of the features which appears to me to\r\nmark, in a very prominent manner, the character of the stationary\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMENTATORIAL SPIRIT OF THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have already noticed, that, after the first great achievements of\r\nthe founders of sound speculation, in the different departments of\r\nhuman knowledge, had attracted the interest and admiration which those\r\nwho became acquainted with them could not but give to them, there\r\nappeared a disposition among men to lean on the authority of some of\r\nthese teachers;--to study the opinions of others as the only mode of\r\nforming their own;--to read nature through books;--to attend to what\r\nhad been already thought and said, rather than to what really is and\r\nhappens. This tendency of men's minds requires our particular\r\nconsideration. Its manifestations were very important, and highly\r\ncharacteristic of the stationary period; it gave, in a great degree, a\r\npeculiar bias and direction to the intellectual activity of many\r\ncenturies; and the kind of labor with which speculative men were\r\noccupied in consequence of this bias, took the place of that\r\nexamination of realities which must be their employment, in order that\r\nreal knowledge may make any decided progress.\r\n\r\nIn some subjects, indeed, as, for instance, in the domains of\r\nmorals, poetry, and the arts, whose aim is the production of beauty,\r\nthis opposition between the study of former opinion and present\r\nreality, may not be so distinct; inasmuch as it may be said by some,\r\nthat, in these subjects, opinions are realities; that the thoughts\r\nand feelings which {202} prevail in men's minds are the material\r\nupon which we must work, the particulars from which we are to\r\ngeneralize, the instruments which we are to use; and that,\r\ntherefore, to reject the study of antiquity, or even its authority,\r\nwould be to show ourselves ignorant of the extent and mutual bearing\r\nof the elements with which we have to deal;--would be to cut asunder\r\nthat which we ought to unite into a vital whole. Yet even in the\r\nprovinces of history and poetry, the poverty and servility of men's\r\nminds during the middle ages, are shown by indications so strong as\r\nto be truly remarkable; for instance, in the efforts of the\r\nantiquarians of almost every European country to assimilate the\r\nearly history of their own state to the poet's account of the\r\nfoundation of Rome, by bringing from the sack of Troy, Brutus to\r\nEngland, Bavo to Flanders, and so on. But however this may be, our\r\nbusiness at present is, to trace the varying spirit of the\r\n_physical_ philosophy of different ages; trusting that, hereafter,\r\nthis prefatory study will enable us to throw some light upon the\r\nother parts of philosophy. And in physics the case undoubtedly was,\r\nthat the labor of observation, which is one of the two great\r\nelements of the progress of knowledge, was in a great measure\r\nsuperseded by the collection, the analysis, the explanation, of\r\nprevious authors and opinions; experimenters were replaced by\r\ncommentators; criticism took the place of induction; and instead of\r\ngreat discoverers we had learned men.\r\n\r\n1. _Natural Bias to Authority._--It is very evident that, in such a\r\nbias of men's studies, there is something very natural; however\r\nstrained and technical this erudition may have been, the\r\npropensities on which it depends are very general, and are easily\r\nseen. Deference to the authority of thoughtful and sagacious men, a\r\ndisposition which men in general neither reject nor think they ought\r\nto reject in practical matters, naturally clings to them, even in\r\nspeculation. It is a satisfaction to us to suppose that there are,\r\nor have been, minds of transcendent powers, of wide and wise views,\r\nsuperior to the common errors and blindness of our nature. The\r\npleasure of admiration, and the repose of confidence, are\r\ninducements to such a belief. There are also other reasons why we\r\nwillingly believe that there are in philosophy great teachers, so\r\nprofound and sagacious, that, in order to arrive at truth, we have\r\nonly to learn their thoughts, to understand their writings. There is\r\na peculiar interest which men feel in dealing with the thoughts of\r\ntheir fellow-men, rather than with brute matter. Matter feels and\r\nexcites no sympathies: in seeking for mere laws of nature, there is\r\nnothing of mental intercourse with the great spirits of the past, as\r\nthere is in {203} studying Aristotle or Plato. Moreover, a large\r\nportion of this employment is of a kind the most agreeable to most\r\nspeculative minds; it consists in tracing the consequences of\r\nassumed principles: it is deductive like geometry: and the\r\nprinciples of the teachers being known, and being undisputed, the\r\ndeduction and application of their results is an obvious,\r\nself-satisfying, and inexhaustible exercise of ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThese causes, and probably others, make criticism and commentation\r\nflourish, when invention begins to fail, oppressed and bewildered by\r\nthe acquisitions it has already made; and when the vigor and hope of\r\nmen's minds are enfeebled by civil and political changes.\r\nAccordingly,[20\\4] the Alexandrian school was eminently\r\ncharacterized by a spirit of erudition, of literary criticism, of\r\ninterpretation, of imitation. These practices, which reigned first\r\nin their full vigor in \"the Museum,\" are likely to be, at all times,\r\nthe leading propensities of similar academical institutions.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\4: Degerando, _Hist. des Syst. de Philos._ iii. p. 134.]\r\n\r\nHow natural it is to select a great writer as a paramount authority,\r\nand to ascribe to him extraordinary profundity and sagacity, we may\r\nsee, in the manner in which the Greeks looked upon Homer; and the\r\nfancy which detected in his poems traces of the origin of all arts\r\nand sciences, has, as we know, found favor even in modern times. To\r\npass over earlier instances of this feeling, we may observe, that\r\nStrabo begins his Geography by saying that he agrees with\r\nHipparchus, who had declared Homer to be the first author of our\r\ngeographical knowledge; and he does not confine the application of\r\nthis assertion to the various and curious topographical information\r\nwhich the Iliad and Odyssey contain, concerning the countries\r\nsurrounding the Mediterranean; but in phrases which, to most\r\npersons, might appear the mere play of a poetical fancy, or a casual\r\nselection of circumstances, he finds unquestionable evidence of a\r\ncorrect knowledge of general geographical truths. Thus,[21\\4] when\r\nHomer speaks of the sun \"rising from the soft and deep-flowing\r\nocean,\" of his \"splendid blaze plunging in the ocean;\" of the\r\nnorthern constellation\r\n  \"Alone unwashen by the ocean wave;\"\r\nand of Jupiter, \"who goes to the ocean to feast with the blameless\r\nEthiopians;\" Strabo is satisfied from these passages that Homer knew\r\nthe dry land to be surrounded with water: and he reasons in like\r\nmanner with respect to other points of geography. {204}\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\4: Strabo, i. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n2. _Character of Commentators._--The spirit of commentation, as has\r\nalready been suggested, turns to questions of taste, of metaphysics,\r\nof morals, with far more avidity than to physics. Accordingly, critics\r\nand grammarians were peculiarly the growth of this school; and, though\r\nthe commentators sometimes chose works of mathematical or physical\r\nscience for their subject (as Proclus, who commented on Euclid's\r\nGeometry, and Simplicius, on Aristotle's Physics), these commentaries\r\nwere, in fact, rather metaphysical than mathematical. It does not\r\nappear that the commentators have, in any instance, illustrated the\r\nauthor by bringing his assertions of facts to the test of experiment.\r\nThus, when Simplicius comments on the passage concerning a vacuum,\r\nwhich we formerly adduced, he notices the argument which went upon the\r\nassertion, that a vessel full of ashes would contain as much water as\r\nan empty vessel; and he mentions various opinions of different\r\nauthors, but no trial of the fact. Eudemus had said, that the ashes\r\ncontained something hot, as quicklime does, and that by means of this,\r\na part of the water was evaporated; others supposed the water to be\r\ncondensed, and so on.[22\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\4: Simplicius, p. 170.]\r\n\r\nThe Commentator's professed object is to explain, to enforce, to\r\nillustrate doctrines assumed as true. He endeavors to adapt the work\r\non which he employs himself to the state of information and of opinion\r\nin his own time; to elucidate obscurities and technicalities; to\r\nsupply steps omitted in the reasoning; but he does not seek to obtain\r\nadditional truths or new generalizations. He undertakes only to give\r\nwhat is virtually contained in his author; to develop, but not to\r\ncreate. He is a cultivator of the thoughts of others: his labor is not\r\nspent on a field of his own; he ploughs but to enrich the granary of\r\nanother man. Thus he does not work as a freeman, but as one in a\r\nservile condition; or rather, his is a menial, and not a productive\r\nservice: his office is to adorn the appearance of his master, not to\r\nincrease his wealth.\r\n\r\nYet though the Commentator's employment is thus subordinate and\r\ndependent, he is easily led to attribute to it the greatest\r\nimportance and dignity. To elucidate good books is, indeed, a useful\r\ntask; and when those who undertake this work execute it well, it\r\nwould be most unreasonable to find fault with them for not doing\r\nmore. But the critic, long and earnestly employed on one author, may\r\neasily underrate the relative value of other kinds of mental\r\nexertion. He may {205} ascribe too large dimensions to that which\r\noccupies the whole of his own field of vision. Thus he may come to\r\nconsider such study as the highest aim, and best evidence of human\r\ngenius. To understand Aristotle, or Plato, may appear to him to\r\ncomprise all that is possible of profundity and acuteness. And when\r\nhe has travelled over a portion of their domain, and satisfied\r\nhimself that of this he too is master, he may look with complacency\r\nat the circuit he has made, and speak of it as a labor of vast\r\neffort and difficulty. We may quote, as an expression of this\r\ntemper, the language of Sir Henry Savile, in concluding a course of\r\nlectures on Euclid, delivered at Oxford.[23\\4] \"By the grace of God,\r\ngentlemen hearers, I have performed my promise; I have redeemed my\r\npledge. I have explained, according to my ability, the definitions,\r\npostulates, axioms, and _first eight propositions_ of the Elements\r\nof Euclid. Here, sinking under the weight of years, I lay down my\r\nart and my instruments.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\4: Exolvi per Dei gratiam, Domini auditores, promissum;\r\nliberavi fldem meam; explicavi pro meo modulo, definitiones,\r\npetitiones, communes sententias, et _octo priores propositiones_\r\nElementorum Euclidis. Hic, annis fessus, cyclos artemque repono.]\r\n\r\nWe here speak of the peculiar province of the Commentator; for\r\nundoubtedly, in many instances, a commentary on a received author\r\nhas been made the vehicle of conveying systems and doctrines\r\nentirely different from those of the author himself; as, for\r\ninstance, when the New Platonists wrote, taking Plato for their\r\ntext. The labors of learned men in the stationary period, which came\r\nunder this description, belong to another class.\r\n\r\n3. _Greek Commentators on Aristotle._--The commentators or disciples\r\nof the great philosophers did not assume at once their servile\r\ncharacter. At first their object was to supply and correct, as well\r\nas to explain their teacher. Thus among the earlier commentators of\r\nAristotle, Theophrastus invented five moods of syllogism in the\r\nfirst figure, in addition to the four invented by Aristotle, and\r\nstated with additional accuracy the rules of hypothetical\r\nsyllogisms. He also not only collected much information concerning\r\nanimals, and natural events, which Aristotle had omitted, but often\r\ndiffered with his master; as, for instance, concerning the saltness\r\nof the sea: this, which the Stagirite attributed to the effect of\r\nthe evaporation produced by the sun's rays, was ascribed by\r\nTheophrastus to beds of salt at the bottom. Porphyry,[24\\4] who\r\nflourished in the third century, wrote a book on the _Predicables_,\r\nwhich was found to be so suitable a complement {206} to the\r\n_Predicaments_ or Categories of Aristotle, that it was usually\r\nprefixed to that treatise; and the two have been used as an\r\nelementary work together, up to modern times. The Predicables are\r\nthe five steps which the gradations of generality and particularity\r\nintroduce;--_genus_, _species_, _difference_, _individual_,\r\n_accident_:--the Categories are the ten heads under which assertions\r\nor predications may be arranged:--_substance_, _quantity_,\r\n_relation_, _quality_, _place_, _time_, _position_, _habit_,\r\n_action_, _passion_.\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\4: Buhle, Arist. i. 284.]\r\n\r\nAt a later period, the Aristotelian commentators became more\r\nservile, and followed the author step by step, explaining, according\r\nto their views, his expressions and doctrines; often, indeed, with\r\nextreme prolixity, expanding his clauses into sentences, and his\r\nsentences into paragraphs. Alexander Aphrodisiensis, who lived at\r\nthe end of the second century, is of this class; \"sometimes useful,\"\r\nas one of the recent editors of Aristotle says;[25\\4] \"but by the\r\nprolixity of his interpretation, by his perverse itch for himself\r\ndiscussing the argument expounded by Aristotle, for defending his\r\nopinions, and for refuting or reconciling those of others, he rather\r\nobscures than enlightens.\" At various times, also, some of the\r\ncommentators, and especially those of the Alexandrian school,\r\nendeavored to reconcile, or combined without reconciling, opposing\r\ndoctrines of the great philosophers of the earlier times.\r\nSimplicius, for instance, and, indeed, a great number of the\r\nAlexandrian Philosophers,[26\\4] as Alexander, Ammonius, and others,\r\nemployed themselves in the futile task of reconciling the doctrines\r\nof the Pythagoreans, of the Eleatics, of Plato, and of the Stoics,\r\nwith those of Aristotle. Boethius[27\\4] entertained the design of\r\ntranslating into Latin the whole of Aristotle's and Plato's works,\r\nand of showing their agreement; a gigantic plan, which he never\r\nexecuted. Others employed themselves in disentangling the confusion\r\nwhich such attempts produced, as John the Grammarian, surnamed\r\nPhiloponus, \"the Labor-loving;\" who, towards the end of the seventh\r\ncentury, maintained that Aristotle was entirely misunderstood by\r\nPorphyry and Proclus,[28\\4] who had pretended to incorporate his\r\ndoctrines into those of the New Platonic school, or even to\r\nreconcile him with Plato himself on the subject of _ideas_. Others,\r\nagain, wrote Epitomes, Compounds, Abstracts; and endeavored to throw\r\nthe works of the philosopher into some simpler and more obviously\r\nregular form, as John of Damascus, in {207} the middle of the eighth\r\ncentury, who made abstracts of some of Aristotle's works, and\r\nintroduced the study of the author into theological education. These\r\ntwo writers lived under the patronage of the Arabs; the former was\r\nfavored by Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt; the latter was at first\r\nsecretary to the Caliph, but afterwards withdrew to a\r\nmonastery.[29\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\4: Ib. i. 288.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\4: Ib. i. 311.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\4: Degerando, _Hist. des Syst._ iv. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\4: Ib. iv. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\4: Deg. iv. 150.]\r\n\r\nAt this period the Arabians became the fosterers and patrons of\r\nphilosophy, rather than the Greeks. Justinian had, by an edict,\r\nclosed the school of Athens, the last of the schools of heathen\r\nphilosophy. Leo, the Isaurian, who was a zealous Iconoclast,\r\nabolished also the schools where general knowledge had been taught,\r\nin combination with Christianity,[30\\4] yet the line of the\r\nAristotelian commentators was continued, though feebly, to the later\r\nages of the Greek empire. Anna Comnena[31\\4] mentions a Eustratus\r\nwho employed himself upon the dialectic and moral treatises, and\r\nwhom she does not hesitate to elevate above the Stoics and\r\nPlatonists, for his talent in philosophical discussions. Nicephorus\r\nBlemmydes wrote logical and physical epitomes for the use of John\r\nDucas; George Pachymerus composed an epitome of the philosophy of\r\nAristotle, and a compend of his logic; Theodore Metochytes, who was\r\nfamous in his time alike for his eloquence and his learning, has\r\nleft a paraphrase of the books of Aristotle on Physics, on the Soul,\r\nthe Heavens,[32\\4] &c. Fabricius states that this writer has a\r\nchapter, the object of which is to prove, that all philosophers, and\r\nAristotle and Plato in particular, have disdained the authority of\r\ntheir predecessors. He could hardly help remarking in how different\r\na spirit philosophy had been pursued since their time.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\4: Ib. iv. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\4: Ib. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\4: Ib. 168.]\r\n\r\n4. _Greek Commentators of Plato and others._--I have spoken\r\nprincipally of the commentators of Aristotle, for he was the great\r\nsubject of the commentators proper; and though the name of his\r\nrival, Plato, was graced by a list of attendants, hardly less\r\nnumerous, these, the Neoplatonists, as they are called, had\r\nintroduced new elements into the doctrines of their nominal master,\r\nto such an extent that they must be placed in a different class. We\r\nmay observe here, however, how, in this school as in the\r\nPeripatetic, the race of commentators multiplied itself. Porphyry,\r\nwho commented on Aristotle, was commented on by Ammonius; Plotinus's\r\nEnneads were commented on by Proclus and Dexippus. Psellus[33\\4] the\r\nelder was a paraphrast of {208} Aristotle; Psellus the younger, in\r\nthe eleventh century, attempted to restore the New Platonic school.\r\nThe former of these two writers had for his pupils two men, the\r\nemperor Leo, surnamed the Philosopher, and Photius the patriarch,\r\nwho exerted themselves to restore the study of literature at\r\nConstantinople. We still possess the Collection of Extracts of\r\nPhotius, which, like that of Stobæus and others, shows the tendency\r\nof the age to compilations, abstracts, and epitomes,--the extinction\r\nof philosophical vitality.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\4: Deg. iv. 169.]\r\n\r\n5. _Arabian Commentators of Aristotle._--The reader might perhaps\r\nhave expected, that when the philosophy of the Greeks was carried\r\namong a new race of intellects, of a different national character\r\nand condition, the train of this servile tradition would have been\r\nbroken; that some new thoughts would have started forth; that some\r\nnew direction, some new impulse, would have been given to the search\r\nfor truth. It might have been anticipated that we should have had\r\nschools among the Arabians which should rival the Peripatetic,\r\nAcademic, and Stoic among the Greeks;--that they would preoccupy the\r\nground on which Copernicus and Galileo, Lavoisier and Linnæus, won\r\ntheir fame;--that they would make the next great steps in the\r\nprogressive sciences. Nothing of this, however, happened. The\r\nArabians cannot claim, in science or philosophy, any really great\r\nnames; they produced no men and no discoveries which have materially\r\ninfluenced the course and destinies of human knowledge; they tamely\r\nadopted the intellectual servitude of the nation which they\r\nconquered by their arms; they joined themselves at once to the\r\nstring of slaves who were dragging the car of Aristotle and\r\nPlotinus. Nor, perhaps, on a little further reflection, shall we be\r\nsurprised at this want of vigor and productive power, in this period\r\nof apparent national youth. The Arabians had not been duly prepared\r\nrightly to enjoy and use the treasures of which they became\r\npossessed. They had, like most uncivilized nations, been\r\npassionately fond of their indigenous poetry; their imagination had\r\nbeen awakened, but their rational powers and speculative tendencies\r\nwere still torpid. They received the Greek philosophy without having\r\npassed through those gradations of ardent curiosity and keen\r\nresearch, of obscurity brightening into clearness, of doubt\r\nsucceeded by the joy of discovery, by which the Greek mind had been\r\nenlarged and exercised. Nor had the Arabians ever enjoyed, as the\r\nGreeks had, the individual consciousness, the independent volition,\r\nthe intellectual freedom, arising from the freedom of political\r\ninstitutions. They had not felt the contagious mental activity of a\r\nsmall city,--the elation arising from the general {209} sympathy in\r\nspeculative pursuits diffused through an intelligent and acute\r\naudience; in short, they had not had a national education such as\r\nfitted the Greeks to be disciples of Plato and Hipparchus. Hence,\r\ntheir new literary wealth rather encumbered and enslaved, than\r\nenriched and strengthened them: in their want of taste for\r\nintellectual freedom, they were glad to give themselves up to the\r\nguidance of Aristotle and other dogmatists. Their military habits\r\nhad accustomed them to look to a leader; their reverence for the\r\nbook of their law had prepared them to accept a philosophical Koran\r\nalso. Thus the Arabians, though they never translated the Greek\r\npoetry, translated, and merely translated, the Greek philosophy;\r\nthey followed the Greek philosophers without deviation, or, at\r\nleast, without any philosophical deviations. They became for the\r\nmost part Aristotelians;--studied not only Aristotle, but the\r\ncommentators of Aristotle; and themselves swelled the vast and\r\nunprofitable herd.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical works of Aristotle had, in some measure, made\r\ntheir way in the East, before the growth of the Saracen power. In\r\nthe sixth century, a Syrian, Uranus,[34\\4] encouraged by the love of\r\nphilosophy manifested by Cosroes, had translated some of the\r\nwritings of the Stagirite; about the same time, Sergius had given\r\nsome translations in Syriac. In the seventh century, Jacob of Edessa\r\ntranslated into this language the Dialectics, and added Notes to the\r\nwork. Such labors became numerous; and the first Arabic translations\r\nof Aristotle were formed upon these Persian or Syriac texts. In this\r\nsuccession of transfusions, some mistakes must inevitably have been\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\4: Deg. iv. 196.]\r\n\r\nThe Arabian interpreters of Aristotle, like a large portion of the\r\nAlexandrian ones, gave to the philosopher a tinge of opinions\r\nborrowed from another source, of which I shall have to speak under\r\nthe head of _Mysticism_. But they are, for the most part,\r\nsufficiently strong examples of the peculiar spirit of commentation,\r\nto make it fitting to notice them here. At the head of them\r\nstands[35\\4] Alkindi, who appears to have lived at the court of\r\nAlmamon, and who wrote commentaries on the Organon of Aristotle. But\r\nAlfarabi was the glory of the school of Bagdad; his knowledge\r\nincluded mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy. Born in\r\nan elevated rank, and possessed of a rich patrimony, he led an\r\naustere life, and devoted himself altogether to study and\r\nmeditation. He employed himself particularly in unfolding the import\r\nof Aristotle's treatise On the Soul.[36\\4] Avicenna (Ebn Sina) {210}\r\nwas at once the Hippocrates and the Aristotle of the Arabians; and\r\ncertainly the most extraordinary man that the nation produced. In\r\nthe course of an unfortunate and stormy life, occupied by politics\r\nand by pleasures, he produced works which were long revered as a\r\nsort of code of science. In particular, his writings on medicine,\r\nthough they contain little besides a compilation of Hippocrates and\r\nGalen, took the place of both, even in the universities of Europe;\r\nand were studied as models at Paris and Montpelier, till the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century, at which period they fell into an almost\r\ncomplete oblivion. Avicenna is conceived, by some modern\r\nwriters,[37\\4] to have shown some power of original thinking in his\r\nrepresentations of the Aristotelian Logic and Metaphysics. Averroes\r\n(Ebn Roshd) of Cordova, was the most illustrious of the Spanish\r\nAristotelians, and became the guide of the schoolmen,[38\\4] being\r\nplaced by them on a level with Aristotle himself, or above him. He\r\ntranslated Aristotle from the first Syriac version, not being able\r\nto read the Greek text. He aspired to, and retained for centuries,\r\nthe title of the _Commentator_; and he deserves this title by the\r\nservility with which he maintains that Aristotle[39\\4] carried the\r\nsciences to the highest possible degree, measured their whole\r\nextent, and fixed their ultimate and permanent boundaries; although\r\nhis works are conceived to exhibit a trace of the New Platonism.\r\nSome of his writings are directed against an Arabian skeptic, of the\r\nname of Algazel, whom we have already noticed.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\4: Ib. iv. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\4: Ib. iv. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\4: Deg. iv. 206.]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\4: Ib. iv. 247. Averroes died A. D. 1206.]\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\4: Ib. iv. 248.]\r\n\r\nWhen the schoolmen had adopted the supremacy of Aristotle to the\r\nextent in which Averroes maintained it, their philosophy went\r\nfurther than a system of mere commentation, and became a system of\r\ndogmatism; we must, therefore, in another chapter, say a few words\r\nmore of the Aristotelians in this point of view, before we proceed\r\nto the revival of science; but we must previously consider some\r\nother features in the character of the Stationary Period. {211}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF THE MYSTICISM OF THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has been already several times hinted, that a new and peculiar\r\nelement was introduced into the Greek philosophy which occupied the\r\nattention of the Alexandrian school; and that this element tinged a\r\nlarge portion of the speculations of succeeding ages. We may speak\r\nof this peculiar element as _Mysticism_; for, from the notion\r\nusually conveyed by this term, the reader will easily apprehend the\r\ngeneral character of the tendency now spoken of; and especially when\r\nhe sees its effect pointed out in various subjects. Thus, instead of\r\nreferring the events of the external world to space and time, to\r\nsensible connection and causation, men attempted to reduce such\r\noccurrences under spiritual and supersensual relations and\r\ndependencies; they referred them to superior intelligences, to\r\ntheological conditions, to past and future events in the moral\r\nworld, to states of mind and feelings, to the creatures of an\r\nimaginary mythology or demonology. And thus their physical Science\r\nbecame Magic, their Astronomy became Astrology, the study of the\r\nComposition of bodies became Alchemy, Mathematics became the\r\ncontemplation of the Spiritual Relations of number and figure, and\r\nPhilosophy became Theosophy.\r\n\r\nThe examination of this feature in the history of the human mind is\r\nimportant for us, in consequence of its influence upon the\r\nemployments and the thoughts of the times now under our notice. This\r\ntendency materially affected both men's speculations and their\r\nlabours in the pursuit of knowledge. By its direct operation, it\r\ngave rise to the newer Platonic philosophy among the Greeks, and to\r\ncorresponding doctrines among the Arabians; and by calling into a\r\nprominent place astrology, alchemy, and magic, it long occupied most\r\nof the real observers of the material world. In this manner it\r\ndelayed and impeded the progress of true science; for we shall see\r\nreason to believe that human knowledge lost more by the perversion\r\nof men's minds and the misdirection of their efforts, than it gained\r\nby any increase of zeal arising from the peculiar hopes and objects\r\nof the mystics.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to attempt any general view of the progress\r\nand fortunes of the various forms of Mystical Philosophy; but only\r\nto exhibit some of its characters, in so far as they illustrate\r\nthose {212} tendencies of thought which accompanied the\r\nretrogradation of inductive science. And of these, the leading\r\nfeature which demands our notice is that already alluded to; namely,\r\nthe practice of referring things and events, not to clear and\r\ndistinct relations, obviously applicable to such cases;--not to\r\ngeneral rules capable of direct verification; but to notions vague,\r\ndistant, and vast, which we cannot bring into contact with facts,\r\nbecause they belong to a different region from the facts; as when we\r\nconnect natural events with moral or historical causes, or seek\r\nspiritual meanings in the properties of number and figure. Thus the\r\ncharacter of Mysticism is, that it refers particulars, not to\r\ngeneralizations homogeneous and immediate, but to such as are\r\nheterogeneous and remote; to which we must add, that the process of\r\nthis reference is not a calm act of the intellect, but is\r\naccompanied with a glow of enthusiastic feeling.\r\n\r\n1. _Neoplatonic Theosophy._--The _Newer Platonism_ is the first\r\nexample of this Mystical Philosophy which I shall consider. The main\r\npoints which here require our notice are, the doctrine of an\r\nIntellectual World resulting from the act of the Divine Mind, as the\r\nonly reality; and the aspiration after the union of the human soul\r\nwith this Divine Mind, as the object of human existence. The \"Ideas\"\r\nof Plato were Forms of our knowledge; but among the Neoplatonists\r\nthey became really existing, indeed the only really existing,\r\nObjects; and the inaccessible scheme of the universe which these\r\nideas constitute, was offered as the great subject of philosophical\r\ncontemplation. The desire of the human mind to approach towards its\r\nCreator and Preserver, and to obtain a spiritual access to Him,\r\nleads to an employment of the thoughts which is well worth the\r\nnotice of the religious philosopher; but such an effort, even when\r\nfounded on revelation and well regulated, is not a means of advance\r\nin physics; and when it is the mere result of natural enthusiasm, it\r\nmay easily obtain such a place in men's minds as to unfit them for\r\nthe successful prosecution of natural philosophy. The temper,\r\ntherefore, which introduces such supernatural communion into the\r\ngeneral course of its speculations, may be properly treated as\r\nmystical, and as one of the causes of the decline of science in the\r\nStationary Period. The Neoplatonic philosophy requires our notice as\r\none of the most remarkable forms of this Mysticism.\r\n\r\nThough Ammonius Saccas, who flourished at the end of the second\r\ncentury, is looked upon as the beginner of the Neoplatonists, his\r\ndisciple Plotinus is, in reality, the great founder of the school,\r\nboth by his {213} works, which still remain to us, and by the\r\nenthusiasm which his character and manners inspired among his\r\nfollowers. He lived a life of meditation, gentleness, and\r\nself-denial, and died in the second year of the reign of Claudius\r\n(A. D. 270). His disciple, Porphyry, has given us a Life of him,\r\nfrom which we may see how well his habitual manners were suited to\r\nmake his doctrines impressive. \"Plotinus, the philosopher of our\r\ntime,\" Porphyry thus begins his biography, \"appeared like a person\r\nashamed that he was in the body. In consequence of this disposition,\r\nhe could not bear to talk concerning his family, or his parents, or\r\nhis country. He would not allow himself to be represented by a\r\npainter or statuary; and once, when Aurelius entreated him to permit\r\na likeness of him to be taken, he said, 'Is it not enough for us to\r\ncarry this image in which nature has enclosed us, but we must also\r\ntry to leave a more durable image of this image, as if it were so\r\ngreat a sight?' And he retained the same temper to the last. When he\r\nwas dying, he said, 'I am trying to bring the divinity which is in\r\nus to the divinity which is in the universe.'\" He was looked upon by\r\nhis successors with extraordinary admiration and reverence; and his\r\ndisciple Porphyry collected from his lips, or from fragmental notes,\r\nthe six _Enneads_ of his doctrines (that is, parts each consisting\r\nof _nine_ Books), which he arranged and annotated.\r\n\r\nWe have no difficulty in finding in this remarkable work examples of\r\nmystical speculation. The Intelligible World of realities or essences\r\ncorresponds to the world of sense[40\\4] in the classes of things which\r\nit includes. To the Intelligible World, man's mind ascends, by a\r\ntriple road which Plotinus figuratively calls that of the Musician,\r\nthe Lover, the Philosopher.[41\\4] The activity of the human soul is\r\nidentified by analogy with the motion of the heavens. \"This activity\r\nis about a middle point, and thus it is circular; but a middle point\r\nis not the same in body and in the soul: in that, the middle point is\r\nlocal; in this, it is that on which the rest depends. There is,\r\nhowever, an analogy; for as in one case, so in the other, there must\r\nbe a middle point, and as the sphere revolves about its centre, the\r\nsoul revolves about God through its affections.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\4: vi. Ennead, iii. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\4: ii. E. ii. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the work is,[42\\4] as might be supposed, upon the\r\napproach to, union with, and fruition of God. The author refers\r\nagain to the analogy between the movements of the soul and those of\r\nthe heavens. \"We move round him like a choral dance; even when we\r\n{214} look from him we revolve about him: we do not always look at\r\nhim, but when we do, we have satisfaction and rest, and the harmony\r\nwhich belongs to that divine movement. In this movement, the mind\r\nbeholds the fountain of life, the fountain of mind, the origin of\r\nbeing, the cause of good, the root of the soul.\"[43\\4] \"There will\r\nbe a time when this vision shall be continual; the mind being no\r\nmore interrupted, nor suffering any perturbation from the body. Yet\r\nthat which beholds is not that which is disturbed; and when this\r\nvision becomes dim, it does not obscure the knowledge which resides\r\nin demonstration, and faith, and reasoning; but the vision itself is\r\nnot reason, but greater than reason, and before reason.\"[44\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\4: vi. Enn. ix. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\4: vi. Enn. ix. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\4: vi. Enn. ix. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe fifth book of the third Ennead has for its subject the Dæmon\r\nwhich belongs to each man. It is entitled \"Concerning Love;\" and the\r\ndoctrine appears to be, that the Love, or common source of the\r\npassions which is in each man's mind, is \"the Dæmon which they say\r\naccompanies each man.\"[45\\4] These dæmons were, however (at least by\r\nlater writers), invested with a visible aspect and with a personal\r\ncharacter, including a resemblance of human passions and motives. It\r\nis curious thus to see an untenable and visionary generalization\r\nfalling back into the domain of the senses and the fancy, after a\r\nvain attempt to support itself in the region of the reason. This\r\nimagination soon produced pretensions to the power of making these\r\ndæmons or genii visible; and the Treatise on the Mysteries of the\r\nEgyptians, which is attributed to Iamblichus, gives an account of\r\nthe secret ceremonies, the mysterious words, the sacrifices and\r\nexpiations, by which this was to be done.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\4: Ficinus, _Comm._ in v. Enn. iii.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary for us to dwell on the progress of this school; to\r\npoint out the growth of the Theurgy which thus arose; or to describe\r\nthe attempts to claim a high antiquity for this system, and to make\r\nOrpheus, the poet, the first promulgator of its doctrines. The\r\nsystem, like all mystical systems, assumed the character rather of\r\nreligion than of a theory. The opinions of its disciples materially\r\ninfluenced their lives. It gave the world the spectacle of an\r\naustere morality, a devotional exaltation, combined with the\r\ngrossest superstitions of Paganism. The successors of Iamblichus\r\nappeared rather to hold a priesthood, than the chair of a\r\nphilosophical school.[46\\4] They were persecuted by Constantine and\r\nConstantius, as opponents of Christianity. Sopater, a {215} Syrian\r\nphilosopher of this school, was beheaded by the former emperor on a\r\ncharge that he had bound the winds by the power of magic.[47\\4] But\r\nJulian, who shortly after succeeded to the purple, embraced with\r\nardor the opinions of Iamblichus. Proclus (who died A. D. 487) was\r\none of the greatest of the teachers of this school;[48\\4] and was,\r\nboth in his life and doctrines, a worthy successor of Plotinus,\r\nPorphyry, and Iamblichus. We possess a biography, or rather a\r\npanegyric of him, by his disciple Marinus, in which he is exhibited\r\nas a representation of the ideal perfection of the philosophic\r\ncharacter, according to the views of the Neoplatonists. His virtues\r\nare arranged as physical, moral, purificatory, theoretic, and\r\ntheurgic. Even in his boyhood, Apollo and Minerva visited him in his\r\ndreams: he studied oratory at Alexandria, but it was at Athens that\r\nPlutarch and Lysianus initiated him in the mysteries of the New\r\nPlatonists. He received a kind of consecration at the hands of the\r\ndaughter of Plutarch, the celebrated Asclepigenia, who introduced\r\nhim to the traditions of the Chaldeans, and the practices of\r\ntheurgy; he was also admitted to the mysteries of Eleusis. He became\r\ncelebrated for his knowledge and eloquence; but especially for his\r\nskill in the supernatural arts which were connected with the\r\ndoctrines of his sect. He appears before us rather as a hierophant\r\nthan a philosopher. A large portion of his life was spent in\r\nevocations, purifications, fastings, prayers, hymns, intercourse\r\nwith apparitions, and with the gods, and in the celebration of the\r\nfestivals of Paganism, especially those which were held in honor of\r\nthe Mother of the Gods. His religious admiration extended to all\r\nforms of mythology. The philosopher, said he, is not the priest of a\r\nsingle religion, but of all the religions of the world. Accordingly,\r\nhe composed hymns in honor of all the divinities of Greece, Rome,\r\nEgypt, Arabia;--Christianity alone was excluded from his favor.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\4: Deg. iii. 407]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\4: Gibbon, iii. 352.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\4: Deg. iii. 419.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will find an interesting view of the _School of\r\nAlexandria_, in M. Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire's _Rapport_ on the\r\n_Mémoires_ sent to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences at\r\nParis, in consequence of its having, in 1841, proposed this as the\r\nsubject of a prize, which was awarded in 1844. M. Saint-Hilaire has\r\nprefixed to this _Rapport_ a dissertation on the Mysticism of that\r\nschool. He, however, uses the term _Mysticism_ in a wider sense than\r\nmy purpose, which regarded mainly the bearing of the doctrines of\r\nthis school upon the progress of the Inductive Sciences, has led me\r\nto do. Although he finds much to {216} admire in the Alexandrian\r\nphilosophy, he declares that they were incapable of treating\r\nscientific questions. The extent to which this is true is well\r\nillustrated by the extract which he gives from Plotinus, on the\r\nquestion, \"Why objects appear smaller in proportion as they are more\r\ndistant.\" Plotinus denies that the reason of this is that the angles\r\nof vision become smaller. His reason for this denial is curious\r\nenough. If it were so, he says, how could the heaven appear smaller\r\nthan it is, since it occupies the whole of the visual angle?\r\n\r\n2. _Mystical Arithmetic._--It is unnecessary further to exemplify,\r\nfrom Proclus, the general mystical character of the school and time\r\nto which he belonged; but we may notice more specially one of the\r\nforms of this mysticism, which very frequently offers itself to our\r\nnotice, especially in him; and which we may call _Mystical\r\nArithmetic_. Like all the kinds of Mysticism, this consists in the\r\nattempt to connect our conceptions of external objects by general\r\nand inappropriate notions of goodness, perfection, and relation to\r\nthe divine essence and government; instead of referring such\r\nconceptions to those appropriate ideas, which, by due attention,\r\nbecome perfectly distinct, and capable of being positively applied\r\nand verified. The subject which is thus dealt with, in the doctrines\r\nof which we now speak, is Number; a notion which tempts men into\r\nthese visionary speculations more naturally than any other. For\r\nnumber is really applicable to moral notions--to emotions and\r\nfeelings, and to their objects--as well as to the things of the\r\nmaterial world. Moreover, by the discovery of the principle of\r\nmusical concords, it had been found, probably most unexpectedly,\r\nthat numerical relations were closely connected with sounds which\r\ncould hardly be distinguished from the expression of thought and\r\nfeeling; and a suspicion might easily arise, that the universe, both\r\nof matter and of thought, might contain many general and abstract\r\ntruths of some analogous kind. The relations of number have so wide\r\na bearing, that the ramifications of such a suspicion could not\r\neasily be exhausted, supposing men willing to follow them into\r\ndarkness and vagueness; which it is precisely the mystical tendency\r\nto do. Accordingly, this kind of speculation appeared very early,\r\nand showed itself first among the Pythagoreans, as we might have\r\nexpected, from the attention which they gave to the theory of\r\nharmony: and this, as well as some other of the doctrines of the\r\nPythagorean philosophy, was adopted by the later Platonists, and,\r\nindeed, by Plato himself, whose speculations concerning number have\r\ndecidedly a mystical character. The mere mathematical relations of\r\nnumbers,--as odd and even, perfect and imperfect, {217} abundant and\r\ndefective,--were, by a willing submission to an enthusiastic bias,\r\nconnected with the notions of good and beauty, which were suggested\r\nby the terms expressing their relations; and principles resulting\r\nfrom such a connection were woven into a wide and complex system. It\r\nis not necessary to dwell long on this subject; the mere titles of\r\nthe works which treated of it show its nature. Archytas[49\\4] is\r\nsaid to have written a treatise on the number _ten_: Telaugé, the\r\ndaughter of Pythagoras, wrote on the number _four_. This number,\r\nindeed, which was known by the name of the _Tetractys_, was very\r\ncelebrated in the school of Pythagoras. It is mentioned in the\r\n\"Golden Verses,\" which are ascribed to him: the pupil is conjured to\r\nbe virtuous,\r\n  Ναὶ μὰ τὸν ἁμετέρᾳ ψυχᾷ παραδόντα τετρακτὺν\r\n  Παγὰν ἀεννάου φύσεως . . . .\r\n  By him who stampt _The Four_ upon the mind,--\r\n  _The Four_, the fount of nature's endless stream.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\4: Mont. ii. 123.]\r\n\r\nIn Plato's works, we have evidence of a similar belief in religious\r\nrelations of Number; and in the new Platonists, this doctrine was\r\nestablished as a system. Proclus, of whom we have been speaking,\r\nfounds his philosophy, in a great measure, on the relation of Unity\r\nand Multiple; from this, he is led to represent the causality of the\r\nDivine Mind by three Triads of abstractions; and in the development\r\nof one part of this system, the number seven is introduced.[50\\4]\r\n\"The intelligible and intellectual gods produce all things\r\ntriadically; for the monads in these latter are divided according to\r\nnumber; and what the monad was in the former, the number is in these\r\nlatter. And the intellectual gods produce all things hebdomically;\r\nfor they evolve the intelligible, and at the same time intellectual\r\ntriads, into intellectual hebdomads, and expand their contracted\r\npowers into intellectual variety.\" Seven is what is called by\r\narithmeticians a _prime_ number, that is, it cannot be produced by\r\nthe multiplication of other numbers. In the language of the New\r\nPlatonists, the number seven is said to be a virgin, and without a\r\nmother, and it is therefore sacred to Minerva. The number six is a\r\nperfect number, and is consecrated to Venus.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\4: Procl. v. 3, Taylor's translation.]\r\n\r\nThe relations of space were dealt with in like manner, the\r\nGeometrical properties being associated with such physical and\r\nmetaphysical notions as vague thought and lively feeling could\r\nanyhow connect with them. We may consider, as an example of\r\nthis,[51\\4] Plato's opinion {218} concerning the particles of the\r\nfour elements. He gave to each kind of particle one of the five\r\nregular solids, about which the geometrical speculations of himself\r\nand his pupils had been employed. The particles of fire were\r\npyramids, because they are sharp, and tend upwards; those of earth\r\nare cubes, because they are stable, and fill space; the particles of\r\nair are octahedral, as most nearly resembling those of fire; those\r\nof water are the icositetrahedron, as most nearly spherical. The\r\ndodecahedron is the figure of the element of the heavens, and shows\r\nits influence in other things, as in the twelve signs of the zodiac.\r\nIn such examples we see how loosely space and number are combined or\r\nconfounded by these mystical visionaries.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\4: Stanley, _Hist. Phil._]\r\n\r\nThese numerical dreams of ancient philosophers have been imitated by\r\nmodern writers; for instance, by Peter Bungo and Kircher, who have\r\nwritten De Mysteriis Numerorum. Bungo treats of the mystical\r\nproperties of each of the numbers in order, at great length. And\r\nsuch speculations have influenced astronomical theories. In the\r\nfirst edition of the Alphonsine Tables,[52\\4] the precession was\r\nrepresented by making the first point of Aries move, in a period of\r\n7000 years, through a circle of which the radius was 18 degrees,\r\nwhile the circle moved round the ecliptic in 49,000 years; and these\r\nnumbers, 7000 and 49,000, were chosen probably by Jewish\r\ncalculators, or with reference to Jewish Sabbatarian notions.\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\4: Montucla, i. 511.]\r\n\r\n3. _Astrology._--Of all the forms which mysticism assumed, none was\r\ncultivated more assiduously than astrology. Although this art\r\nprevailed most universally and powerfully during the stationary\r\nperiod, its existence, even as a detailed technical system, goes\r\nback to a very early age. It probably had its origin in the East; it\r\nis universally ascribed to the Babylonians and Chaldeans; the name\r\n_Chaldean_ was, at Rome, synonymous with _mathematicus_, or\r\nastrologer; and we read repeatedly that this class of persons were\r\nexpelled from Italy by a decree of the senate, both during the times\r\nof the republic and of the empire.[53\\4] The recurrence of this act\r\nof legislation shows that it was not effectual: \"It is a class of\r\nmen,\" says Tacitus, \"which, in our city, will always be prohibited,\r\nand will always exist.\" In Greece, it does not appear that the state\r\nshowed any hostility to the professors of this art. They undertook,\r\nit would seem, then, as at a later period, to determine the course\r\nof a man's character and life from the configuration of the stars at\r\nthe moment of his birth. We do not possess any of the {219}\r\nspeculations of the early astrologers; and we cannot therefore be\r\ncertain that the notions which operated in men's minds when the art\r\nhad its birth, agreed with the views on which it was afterwards\r\ndefended, when it became a matter of controversy. But it appears\r\nprobable, that, though it was at later periods supported by physical\r\nanalogies, it was originally suggested by mythological belief. The\r\nGreeks spoke of the _influences_ or _effluxes_ (ἀπόῤῥοιας) which\r\nproceeded from the stars; but the Chaldeans had probably thought\r\nrather of the powers which they exercised as _deities_. In whatever\r\nmanner the sun, moon, and planets came to be identified with gods\r\nand goddesses, it is clear that the characters ascribed to these\r\ngods and goddesses regulate the virtues and powers of the stars\r\nwhich bear their names. This association, so manifestly visionary,\r\nwas retained, amplified, and pursued, in an enthusiastic spirit,\r\ninstead of being rejected for more distinct and substantial\r\nconnections; and a pretended science was thus formed, which bears\r\nthe obvious stamp of mysticism.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\4: Tacit. _Ann._ ii. 32. xii. 52. _Hist._ I. 22, II. 62.]\r\n\r\nThat common sense of mankind which teaches them that theoretical\r\nopinions are to be calmly tried by their consequences and their\r\naccordance with facts, appears to have counteracted the prevalence\r\nof astrology in the better times of the human mind. Eudoxus, as we\r\nare informed by Cicero,[54\\4] rejected the pretensions of the\r\nChaldeans; and Cicero himself reasons against them with arguments as\r\nsensible and intelligent as could be adduced by a writer of the\r\npresent day; such as the different fortunes and characters of\r\npersons born at the same time; and the failure of the predictions,\r\nin the case of Pompey, Crassus, Cæsar, to whom the astrologers had\r\nforetold glorious old age and peaceful death. He also employs an\r\nargument which the reader would perhaps not expect from him,--the\r\nvery great remoteness of the planets as compared with the distance\r\nof the moon. \"What contagion can reach us,\" he asks, \"from a\r\ndistance almost infinite?\"\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\4: Cic. _de Div._ ii. 42.]\r\n\r\nPliny argues on the same side, and with some of the same\r\narguments.[55\\4] \"Homer,\" he says, \"tells us that Hector and\r\nPolydamus were born the same night;--men of such different fortune.\r\nAnd every hour, in every part of the world, are born lords and\r\nslaves, kings and beggars.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\4: _Hist. Nat._ vii. 49.]\r\n\r\nThe impression made by these arguments is marked in an anecdote told\r\nconcerning Publius Nigidius Figulus, a Roman of the time of Julius\r\nCæsar, whom Lucan mentions as a celebrated astrologer. It is {220}\r\nsaid, that when an opponent of the art urged as an objection the\r\ndifferent fates of persons born in two successive instants, Nigidius\r\nbade him make two contiguous marks on a potter's wheel, which was\r\nrevolving rapidly near them. On stopping the wheel, the two marks were\r\nfound to be really far removed from each other; and Nigidius is said\r\nto have received the name of Figulus (the potter), in remembrance of\r\nthis story, His argument, says St. Augustine, who gives us the\r\nnarrative, was as fragile as the ware which the wheel manufactured.\r\n\r\nAs the darkening times of the Roman empire advanced, even the\r\nstronger minds seem to have lost the clear energy which was\r\nrequisite to throw off this delusion. Seneca appears to take the\r\ninfluence of the planets for granted; and even Tacitus[56\\4] seems\r\nto hesitate. \"For my own part,\" says he, \"I doubt; but certainly the\r\nmajority of mankind cannot be weaned from the opinion, that, at the\r\nbirth of each man, his future destiny is fixed; though some things\r\nmay fall out differently from the predictions, by the ignorance of\r\nthose who profess the art; and that thus the art is unjustly blamed,\r\nconfirmed as it is by noted examples in all ages.\" The occasion\r\nwhich gives rise to these reflections of the historian is the\r\nmention of Thrasyllus, the favorite astrologer of the Emperor\r\nTiberius, whose skill is exemplified in the following narrative.\r\nThose who were brought to Tiberius on any important matter, were\r\nadmitted to an interview in an apartment situated on a lofty cliff\r\nin the island of Capreæ. They reached this place by a narrow path,\r\naccompanied by a single freedman of great bodily strength; and on\r\ntheir return, if the emperor had conceived any doubts of their\r\ntrustworthiness, a single blow buried the secret and its victim in\r\nthe ocean below. After Thrasyllus had, in this retreat, stated the\r\nresults of his art as they concerned the emperor, Tiberius asked him\r\nwhether he had calculated how long he himself had to live. The\r\nastrologer examined the aspect of the stars, and while he did this,\r\nas the narrative states, showed hesitation, alarm, increasing\r\nterror, and at last declared that, \"the present hour was for him\r\ncritical, perhaps fatal.\" Tiberius embraced him, and told him \"he\r\nwas right in supposing he had been in danger, but that he should\r\nescape it;\" and made him thenceforth his confidential counsellor.\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\4: _Ann._ vi. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe belief in the power of astrological prediction which thus obtained\r\ndominion over the minds of men of literary cultivation and practical\r\nenergy, naturally had a more complete sway among the speculative {221}\r\nbut unstable minds of the later philosophical schools of Alexandria,\r\nAthens, and Rome. We have a treatise on astrology by Proclus, which\r\nwill serve to exemplify the mystical principle in this form. It\r\nappears as a commentary on a work on the same subject called\r\n\"Tetrabiblos,\" ascribed to Ptolemy; though we may reasonably doubt\r\nwhether the author of the \"Megale Syntaxis\" was also the writer of the\r\nastrological work. A few notices of the commentary of Proclus will\r\nsuffice.[57\\4] The science is defended by urging how powerful we know\r\nthe physical effects of the heavenly bodies to be. \"The sun regulates\r\nall things on earth;--the birth of animals, the growth of fruits, the\r\nflowing of waters, the change of health, according to the seasons: he\r\nproduces heat, moisture, dryness, cold, according to his approach to\r\nour zenith. The moon, which is the nearest of all bodies to the earth,\r\ngives out much _influence_; and all things, animate and inanimate,\r\nsympathize with her: rivers increase and diminish according to her\r\nlight; the advance of the sea, and its recess, are regulated by her\r\nrising and setting; and along with her, fruits and animals wax and\r\nwane, either wholly or in part.\" It is easy to see that by pursuing\r\nthis train of associations (some real and some imaginary) very vaguely\r\nand very enthusiastically, the connections which astrology supposes\r\nwould receive a kind of countenance. Proclus then proceeds to\r\nstate[58\\4] the doctrines of the science. \"The sun,\" he says, \"is\r\nproductive of heat and dryness; this power is moderate in its nature,\r\nbut is more perceived than that of the other luminaries, from his\r\nmagnitude, and from the change of seasons. The nature of the moon is\r\nfor the most part moist; for being the nearest to the earth, she\r\nreceives the vapors which rise from moist bodies, and thus she causes\r\nbodies to soften and rot. But by the illumination she receives from\r\nthe sun, she partakes in a moderate degree of heat. Saturn is cold and\r\ndry, being most distant both from the heating power of the sun, and\r\nthe moist vapors of the earth. His cold, however, is most prevalent,\r\nhis dryness is more moderate. Both he and the rest receive additional\r\npowers from the configurations which they make with respect to the sun\r\nand moon.\" In the same manner it is remarked that Mars is dry and\r\ncaustic, from his fiery nature, which, indeed, his color shows.\r\nJupiter is well compounded of warm and moist, as is Venus. Mercury is\r\nvariable in his character. From these notions were derived others\r\nconcerning the beneficial or hurtful effect of these stars. Heat and\r\n{222} moisture are generative and creative elements; hence the\r\nancients, says Proclus, deemed Jupiter, and Venus, and the Moon to\r\nhave a good power; Saturn and Mercury, on the other hand, had an evil\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\4: I. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\4: I. 4.]\r\n\r\nOther distinctions of the character of the stars are enumerated,\r\nequally visionary, and suggested by the most fanciful connections.\r\nSome are masculine, and some feminine: the Moon and Venus are of the\r\nlatter kind. This appears to be merely a mythological or\r\netymological association. Some are diurnal, some nocturnal: the Moon\r\nand Venus are of the latter kind, the Sun and Jupiter of the former;\r\nSaturn and Mars are both.\r\n\r\nThe fixed stars, also, and especially those of the zodiac, had\r\nespecial influences and subjects assigned to them. In particular, each\r\nsign was supposed to preside over a particular part of the body; thus\r\nAries had the head assigned to it, Taurus the neck, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the sky in the astrologer's consideration,\r\nwas that sign of the zodiac which rose at the moment of the child's\r\nbirth; this was, properly speaking, the _horoscope_, the _ascendant_,\r\nor the _first house_; the whole circuit of the heavens being divided\r\ninto twelve _houses_, in which life and death, marriage and children,\r\nriches and honors, friends and enemies, were distributed.\r\n\r\nWe need not attempt to trace the progress of this science. It\r\nprevailed extensively among the Arabians, as we might expect from the\r\ncharacter of that nation. Albumasar, of Balkh in Khorasan, who\r\nflourished in the ninth century, who was one of their greatest\r\nastronomers, was also a great astrologer; and his work on the latter\r\nsubject, \"De Magnis Conjunctionibus, Annorum Revolutionibus ac eorum\r\nPerfectionibus,\" was long celebrated in Europe. Aboazen Haly (the\r\nwriter of a treatise \"De Judiciis Astrorum\"), who lived in Spain in\r\nthe thirteenth century, was one of the classical authors on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be supposed that when this _apotelesmatic_ or\r\n_judicial_ astrology obtained firm possession of men's minds, it\r\nwould be pursued into innumerable subtle distinctions and\r\nextravagant conceits; and the more so, as experience could offer\r\nlittle or no check to such exercises of fancy and subtlety. For the\r\ncorrection of rules of astrological divination by comparison with\r\nknown events, though pretended to by many professors of the art, was\r\nfar too vague and fallible a guidance to be of any real advantage.\r\nEven in what has been called Natural Astrology, the dependence of\r\nthe weather on the heavenly bodies, it is easy to see what a vast\r\naccumulation of well-observed facts is requisite to establish {223}\r\nany true rule; and it is well known how long, in spite of facts,\r\nfalse and groundless rules (as the dependence of the weather on the\r\nmoon) may keep their hold on men's minds. When the facts are such\r\nloose and many-sided things as human characters, passions, and\r\nhappiness, it was hardly to be expected that even the most powerful\r\nminds should be able to find a footing sufficiently firm, to enable\r\nthem to resist the impression of a theory constructed of sweeping\r\nand bold assertions, and filled out into a complete system of\r\ndetails. Accordingly, the connection of the stars with human persons\r\nand actions was, for a long period, undisputed. The vague, obscure,\r\nand heterogeneous character of such a connection, and its unfitness\r\nfor any really scientific reasoning, could, of course, never be got\r\nrid of; and the bewildering feeling of earnestness and solemnity,\r\nwith which the connection of the heavens with man was contemplated,\r\nnever died away. In other respects, however, the astrologers fell\r\ninto a servile commentatorial spirit; and employed themselves in\r\nannotating and illustrating the works of their predecessors to a\r\nconsiderable extent, before the revival of true science.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, that astrology has long been, and probably is,\r\nan art held in great esteem and admiration among other eastern\r\nnations besides the Mohammedans; for instance, the Jews, the\r\nIndians, the Siamese, and the Chinese. The prevalence of vague,\r\nvisionary, and barren notions among these nations, cannot surprise\r\nus; for with regard to them we have no evidence, as with regard to\r\nEuropeans we have, that they are capable, on subjects of physical\r\nspeculation, of originating sound and rational general principles.\r\nThe Arts may have had their birth in all parts of the globe; but it\r\nis only Europe, at particular favored periods of its history, which\r\nhas ever produced Sciences.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, now speaking of a long period, during which this\r\nproductive energy was interrupted and suspended. During this period\r\nEurope descended, in intellectual character, to the level at which\r\nthe other parts of the world have always stood. Her Science was then\r\na mixture of Art and Mysticism; we have considered several forms of\r\nthis Mysticism, but there are two others which must not pass\r\nunnoticed, Alchemy and Magic.\r\n\r\nWe may observe, before we proceed, that the deep and settled\r\ninfluence which Astrology had obtained among them, appears perhaps\r\nmost strongly in the circumstance, that the most vigorous and\r\nclear-sighted minds which were concerned in the revival of science,\r\ndid not, for a long period, shake off the persuasion that there was,\r\nin this art, some element of truth. Roger Bacon, Cardan, Kepler,\r\nTycho Brahe, {224} Francis Bacon, are examples of this. These, or\r\nmost of them, rejected all the more obvious and extravagant\r\nabsurdities with which the subject had been loaded; but still\r\nconceived that some real and valuable truth remained when all these\r\nwere removed. Thus Campanella,[59\\4] whom we shall have to speak of\r\nas one of the first opponents of Aristotle, wrote an \"Astrology\r\npurified from all the Superstitions of the Jews and Arabians, and\r\ntreated physiologically.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\4: Bacon, _De Aug._ iii. 4.]\r\n\r\n4. _Alchemy._--Like other kinds of Mysticism, Alchemy seems to have\r\ngrown out of the notions of moral, personal, and mythological\r\nqualities, which men associated with terms, of which the primary\r\napplication was to physical properties. This is the form in which\r\nthe subject is presented to us in the earliest writings which we\r\npossess on the subject of chemistry;--those of Geber[60\\4] of\r\nSeville, who is supposed to have lived in the eighth or ninth\r\ncentury. The very titles of Geber's works show the notions on which\r\nthis pretended science proceeds. They are, \"Of the Search of\r\nPerfection;\" \"Of the Sum of Perfection, or of the Perfect\r\nMagistery;\" \"Of the Invention of Verity, or Perfection.\" The basis\r\nof this phraseology is the distinction of metals into more or less\r\n_perfect_; gold being the most perfect, as being the most valuable,\r\nmost beautiful, most pure, most durable; silver the next; and so on.\r\nThe \"Search of Perfection\" was, therefore, the attempt to convert\r\nother metals into gold; and doctrines were adopted which represented\r\nthe metals as all compounded of the same elements, so that this was\r\ntheoretically possible. But the mystical trains of association were\r\npursued much further than this; gold and silver were held to be the\r\nmost noble of metals; gold was their King, and silver their Queen.\r\nMythological associations were called in aid of these fancies, as\r\nhad been done in astrology. Gold was Sol, silver was Luna, the moon;\r\ncopper, iron, tin, lead, were assigned to Venus, Mars, Jupiter,\r\nSaturn. The processes of mixture and heat were spoken of as personal\r\nactions and relations, struggles and victories. Some elements were\r\nconquerors, some conquered; there existed preparations which\r\npossessed the power of changing the whole of a body into a substance\r\nof another kind: these were called _magisteries_.[61\\4] When gold\r\nand quicksilver are combined, the king and the queen are married, to\r\nproduce children of their own kind. It will easily be conceived,\r\nthat when chemical operations were described in phraseology of this\r\nsort, the enthusiasm of the {225} fancy would be added to that of\r\nthe hopes, and observation would not be permitted to correct the\r\ndelusion, or to suggest sounder and more rational views.\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\4: Thomson's _Hist. of Chem._ i. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\4: Boyle, Thomson's _Hist. Ch._ i. 25. Carolus Musitanus.]\r\n\r\nThe exaggeration of the vague notion of perfection and power in the\r\nobject of the alchemist's search, was carried further still. The\r\nsame preparation which possessed the faculty of turning baser metals\r\ninto gold, was imagined to be also a universal medicine, to have the\r\ngift of curing or preventing diseases, prolonging life, producing\r\nbodily strength and beauty: the _philosophers' stone_ was finally\r\ninvested with every desirable efficacy which the fancy of the\r\n\"philosophers\" could devise.\r\n\r\nIt has been usual to say that Alchemy was the mother of Chemistry;\r\nand that men would never have made the experiments on which the real\r\nscience is founded, if they had not been animated by the hopes and\r\nthe energy which the delusive art inspired. To judge whether this is\r\ntruly said, we must be able to estimate the degree of interest which\r\nmen feel in purely speculative truth, and in the real and\r\nsubstantial improvement of art to which it leads. Since the fall of\r\nAlchemy, and the progress of real Chemistry, these motives have been\r\npowerful enough to engage in the study of the science, a body far\r\nlarger than the Alchemists ever were, and no less zealous. There is\r\nno apparent reason why the result should not have been the same, if\r\nthe progress of true science had begun sooner. Astronomy was long\r\ncultivated without the bribe of Astrology. But, perhaps, we may\r\njustly say this;--that, in the stationary period, men's minds were\r\nso far enfeebled and degraded, that pure speculative truth had not\r\nits full effect upon them; and the mystical pursuits in which some\r\ndim and disfigured images of truth were sought with avidity, were\r\namong the provisions by which the human soul, even when sunk below\r\nits best condition, is perpetually directed to something above the\r\nmere objects of sense and appetite;--a contrivance of compensation,\r\nas it were, in the intellectual and spiritual constitution of man.\r\n\r\n5. _Magic._--Magical Arts, so far as they were believed in by those\r\nwho professed to practise them, and so far as they have a bearing in\r\nscience, stand on the same footing as astrology; and, indeed, a\r\nclose alliance has generally been maintained between the two\r\npursuits. Incapacity and indisposition to perceive natural and\r\nphilosophical causation, an enthusiastic imagination, and such a\r\nfaith as can devise and maintain supernatural and spiritual\r\nconnexions, are the elements of this, as of other forms of\r\nMysticism. And thus, that temper which led men to aim at the\r\nmagician's supposed authority over the elements, {226} is an\r\nadditional exemplification of those habits of thought which\r\nprevented the progress of real science, and the acquisition of that\r\ncommand over nature which is founded on science, during the interval\r\nnow before us.\r\n\r\nBut there is another aspect under which the opinions connected with\r\nthis pursuit may serve to illustrate the mental character of the\r\nStationary Period.\r\n\r\nThe tendency, during the middle ages, to attribute the character of\r\nMagician to almost all persons eminent for great speculative or\r\npractical knowledge, is a feature of those times, which shows how\r\nextensive and complete was the inability to apprehend the nature of\r\nreal science. In cultivated and enlightened periods, such as those of\r\nancient Greece, or modern Europe, knowledge is wished for and admired,\r\neven by those who least possess it: but in dark and degraded periods,\r\nsuperior knowledge is a butt for hatred and fear. In the one case,\r\nmen's eyes are open; their thoughts are clear; and, however high the\r\nphilosopher may be raised above the multitude, they can catch glimpses\r\nof the intervening path, and see that it is free to all, and that\r\nelevation is the reward of energy and labor. In the other case, the\r\ncrowd are not only ignorant, but spiritless; they have lost the\r\npleasure in knowledge, the appetite for it, and the feeling of dignity\r\nwhich it gives: there is no sympathy which connects them with the\r\nlearned man: they see him above them, but know not how he is raised or\r\nsupported: he becomes an object of aversion and envy, of vague\r\nsuspicion and terror; and these emotions are embodied and confirmed by\r\nassociation with the fancies and dogmas of superstition. To consider\r\nsuperior knowledge as Magic, and Magic as a detestable and criminal\r\nemployment, was the form which these feelings of dislike assumed; and\r\nat one period in the history of Europe, almost every one who had\r\ngained any eminent literary fame, was spoken of as a magician.\r\nNaudæus, a learned Frenchman, in the seventeenth century, wrote \"An\r\nApology for all the Wise Men who have been unjustly reported\r\nMagicians, from the Creation to the present Age.\" The list of persons\r\nwhom he thus thinks it necessary to protect, are of various classes\r\nand ages. Alkindi, Geber, Artephius, Thebit, Raymund Lully, Arnold de\r\nVillâ Novâ, Peter of Apono, and Paracelsus, had incurred the black\r\nsuspicion as physicians or alchemists. Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon,\r\nMichael Scott, Picus of Mirandula, and Trithemius, had not escaped it,\r\nthough ministers of religion. Even dignitaries, such as Robert\r\nGrosteste, Bishop of Lincoln, Albertus Magnus, Bishop of Ratisbon,\r\n{227} Popes Sylvester the Second, and Gregory the Seventh, had been\r\ninvolved in the wide calumny. In the same way in which the vulgar\r\nconfounded the eminent learning and knowledge which had appeared in\r\nrecent times, with skill in dark and supernatural arts, they converted\r\ninto wizards all the best-known names in the rolls of fame; as\r\nAristotle, Solomon, Joseph, Pythagoras; and, finally, the poet Virgil\r\nwas a powerful and skilful necromancer, and this fancy was exemplified\r\nby many strange stories of his achievements and practices.\r\n\r\nThe various results of the tendency of the human mind to mysticism,\r\nwhich we have here noticed, form prominent features in the\r\nintellectual character of the world, for a long course of centuries.\r\nThe theosophy and theurgy of the Neoplatonists, the mystical\r\narithmetic of the Pythagoreans and their successors, the predictions\r\nof the astrologers, the pretences of alchemy and magic, represent,\r\nnot unfairly, the general character and disposition of men's\r\nthoughts, with reference to philosophy and science. That there were\r\nstronger minds, which threw off in a greater or less degree this\r\ntrain of delusive and unsubstantial ideas, is true; as, on the other\r\nhand, Mysticism, among the vulgar or the foolish, often went to an\r\nextent of extravagance and superstition, of which I have not\r\nattempted to convey any conception. The lesson which the preceding\r\nsurvey teaches us is, that during the Stationary Period, Mysticism,\r\nin its various forms, was a leading character, both of the common\r\nmind, and of the speculations of the most intelligent and profound\r\nreasoners; and that this Mysticism was the opposite of that habit of\r\nthought which we have stated Science to require; namely, clear\r\nIdeas, distinctly employed to connect well-ascertained Facts;\r\ninasmuch as the Ideas in which it dealt were vague and unstable, and\r\nthe temper in which they were contemplated was an urgent and\r\naspiring enthusiasm, which could not submit to a calm conference\r\nwith experience upon even terms. The fervor of thought in some\r\ndegree supplied the place of reason in producing belief; but\r\nopinions so obtained had no enduring value; they did not exhibit a\r\npermanent record of old truths, nor a firm foundation for new.\r\nExperience collected her stores in vain, or ceased to collect them,\r\nwhen she had only to pour them into the flimsy folds of the lap of\r\nMysticism; who was, in truth, so much absorbed in looking for the\r\ntreasures which were to fall from the skies, that she heeded little\r\nhow scantily she obtained, or how loosely she held, such riches as\r\nmight be found near her. {228}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE DOGMATISM OF THE STATIONARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN speaking of the character of the age of commentators, we noticed\r\nprincipally the ingenious servility which it displays;--the\r\nacuteness with which it finds ground for speculation in the\r\nexpression of other men's thoughts;--the want of all vigor and\r\nfertility in acquiring any real and new truths. Such was the\r\ncharacter of the reasoners of the stationary period from the first;\r\nbut, at a later day, this character, from various causes, was\r\nmodified by new features. The servility which had yielded itself to\r\nthe yoke, insisted upon forcing it on the necks of others: the\r\nsubtlety which found all the truth it needed in certain accredited\r\nwritings, resolved that no one should find there, or in any other\r\nregion, any other truths; speculative men became tyrants without\r\nceasing to be slaves; to their character of Commentators they added\r\nthat of Dogmatists.\r\n\r\n1. _Origin of the Scholastic Philosophy._--The causes of this change\r\nhave been very happily analyzed and described by several modern\r\nwriters.[62\\4] The general nature of the process may be briefly\r\nstated to have been the following.\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\4:  Dr. Hampden, in the Life of Thomas Aquinas, in the\r\n_Encyc. Metrop._ Degerando, _Hist. Comparée_, vol. iv. Also\r\nTennemann, _Hist. of Phil._ vol. viii. Introduction.]\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of the later times of the Roman empire to a\r\ncommenting literature, and a second-hand philosophy, have already\r\nbeen noticed. The loss of the dignity of political freedom, the want\r\nof the cheerfulness of advancing prosperity, and the substitution of\r\nthe less philosophical structure of the Latin language for the\r\ndelicate intellectual mechanism of the Greek, fixed and augmented\r\nthe prevalent feebleness and barrenness of intellect. Men forgot, or\r\nfeared, to consult nature, to seek for new truths, to do what the\r\ngreat discoverers of other times had done; they were content to\r\nconsult libraries, to study and defend old opinions, to talk of what\r\ngreat geniuses had said. They sought their philosophy in accredited\r\ntreatises, and dared not question such doctrines as they there found.\r\n\r\nThe character of the philosophy to which they were thus led, was\r\ndetermined by this want of courage and originality. There are various\r\n{229} antagonist principles of opinion, which seem alike to have their\r\nroot in the intellectual constitution of man, and which are maintained\r\nand developed by opposing sects, when the intellect is in vigorous\r\naction. Such principles are, for instance,--the claims of Authority\r\nand of Reason to our assent;--the source of our knowledge in\r\nExperience or in Ideas;--the superiority of a Mystical or of a\r\nSkeptical turn of thought. Such oppositions of doctrine were found in\r\nwriters of the greatest fame; and two of those, who most occupied the\r\nattention of students, Plato and Aristotle, were, on several points of\r\nthis nature, very diverse from each other in their tendency. The\r\nattempt to reconcile these philosophers by Boëthius and others, we\r\nhave already noticed; and the attempt was so far successful, that it\r\nleft on men's minds the belief in the possibility of a great\r\nphilosophical system which should be based on both these writers, and\r\nhave a claim to the assent of all sober speculators.\r\n\r\nBut, in the mean time, the Christian Religion had become the leading\r\nsubject of men's thoughts; and divines had put forward its claims to\r\nbe, not merely the guide of men's lives, and the means of\r\nreconciling them to their heavenly Master, but also to be a\r\nPhilosophy in the widest sense in which the term had been used;--a\r\nconsistent speculative view of man's condition and nature, and of\r\nthe world in which he is placed.\r\n\r\nThese claims had been acknowledged; and, unfortunately, from the\r\nintellectual condition of the times, with no due apprehension of the\r\nnecessary ministry of Observation, and Reason dealing with\r\nobservation, by which alone such a system can be embodied. It was\r\nheld without any regulating principle, that the philosophy which had\r\nbeen bequeathed to the world by the great geniuses of heathen\r\nantiquity, and the Philosophy which was deduced from, and implied\r\nby, the Revelations made by God to man, must be identical; and,\r\ntherefore, that Theology is the only true philosophy. Indeed, the\r\nNeoplatonists had already arrived, by other roads, at the same\r\nconviction. John Scot Erigena, in the reign of Alfred, and\r\nconsequently before the existence of the Scholastic Philosophy,\r\nproperly so called, had reasserted this doctrine.[63\\4] Anselm, in\r\nthe eleventh century, again brought it forward;[64\\4] and Bernard de\r\nChartres, in the thirteenth.[65\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\4: Deg. iv. 351.]\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\4: Ib. iv. 388.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\4: Ib. iv. 418.]\r\n\r\nThis view was confirmed by the opinion which prevailed, concerning\r\nthe nature of philosophical truth; a view supported by the theory\r\n{230} of Plato, the practice of Aristotle, and the general\r\npropensities of the human mind: I mean the opinion that all science\r\nmay be obtained by the use of reasoning alone;--that by analysing\r\nand combining the notions which common language brings before us, we\r\nmay learn all that we can know. Thus Logic came to include the whole\r\nof Science; and accordingly this Abelard expressly maintained.[66\\4]\r\nI have already explained, in some measure, the fallacy of this\r\nbelief, which consists, as has been well said,[67\\4] \"in mistaking\r\nthe universality of the theory of language for the generalization of\r\nfacts.\" But on all accounts this opinion is readily accepted; and it\r\nled at once to the conclusion, that the Theological Philosophy which\r\nwe have described, is complete as well as true.\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\4: Deg. iv. 407.]\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\4: _Enc. Met._ 807.]\r\n\r\nThus a Universal Science was established, with the authority of a\r\nReligious Creed. Its universality rested on erroneous views of the\r\nrelation of words and truths; its pretensions as a science were\r\nadmitted by the servile temper of men's intellects; and its\r\nreligious authority was assigned it, by making all truth part of\r\nreligion. And as Religion claimed assent within her own jurisdiction\r\nunder the most solemn and imperative sanctions, Philosophy shared in\r\nher imperial power, and dissent from their doctrines was no longer\r\nblameless or allowable. Error became wicked, dissent became heresy;\r\nto reject the received human doctrines, was nearly the same as to\r\ndoubt the Divine declarations. The _Scholastic Philosophy_ claimed\r\nthe assent of all believers.\r\n\r\nThe external form, the details, and the text of this philosophy,\r\nwere taken, in a great measure, from Aristotle; though, in the\r\nspirit, the general notions, and the style of interpretation, Plato\r\nand the Platonists had no inconsiderable share. Various causes\r\ncontributed to the elevation of Aristotle to this distinction. His\r\nLogic had early been adopted as an instrument of theological\r\ndisputation; and his spirit of systematization, of subtle\r\ndistinction, and of analysis of words, as well as his disposition to\r\nargumentation, afforded the most natural and grateful employment to\r\nthe commentating propensities. Those principles which we before\r\nnoted as the leading points of his physical philosophy, were\r\nselected and adopted; and these, presented in a most technical form,\r\nand applied in a systematic manner, constitute a large portion of\r\nthe philosophy of which we now speak, so far as it pretends to deal\r\nwith physics.\r\n\r\n2. _Scholastic Dogmas._--But before the complete ascendancy of\r\nAristotle was thus established, when something of an intellectual\r\nwaking {231} took place after the darkness and sleep of the ninth\r\nand tenth centuries, the Platonic doctrines seem to have had, at\r\nfirst, a strong attraction for men's minds, as better falling in\r\nwith the mystical speculations and contemplative piety which\r\nbelonged to the times. John Scot Erigena[68\\4] may be looked upon as\r\nthe reviver of the New Platonism in the tenth century. Towards the\r\nend of the eleventh, Peter Damien,[69\\4] in Italy, reproduced,\r\ninvolved in a theological discussion, some Neoplatonic ideas.\r\nGodefroy[70\\4] also, censor of St. Victor, has left a treatise,\r\nentitled _Microcosmus_; this is founded on a mystical analogy, often\r\nafterwards again brought forward, between Man and the Universe.\r\n\"Philosophers and theologians,\" says the writer, \"agree in\r\nconsidering man as a little world; and as the world is composed of\r\nfour elements, man is endowed with four faculties, the senses, the\r\nimagination, reason, and understanding.\" Bernard of Chartres,[71\\4]\r\nin his _Megascosmus_ and _Microcosmus_, took up the same notions.\r\nHugo, abbot of St. Victor, made a contemplative life the main point\r\nand crown of his philosophy; and is said to have been the first of\r\nthe scholastic writers who made psychology his special study.[72\\4]\r\nHe says the faculties of the mind are \"the senses, the imagination,\r\nthe reason, the memory, the understanding, and the intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\4: Deg. iv. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\4: Ib. iv. 367.]\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\4: Ib. iv. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\4: Ib. iv. 419.]\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\4: Ib. iv. 415.]\r\n\r\nPhysics does not originally and properly form any prominent part of\r\nthe Scholastic Philosophy, which consists mainly of a series of\r\nquestions and determinations upon the various points of a certain\r\ntechnical divinity. Of this kind is the _Book of Sentences_ of Peter\r\nthe Lombard (bishop of Paris), who is, on that account, usually\r\ncalled \"Magister Sententiarum;\" a work which was published in the\r\ntwelfth century, and was long the text and standard of such\r\ndiscussions. The questions are decided by the authority of Scripture\r\nand of the Fathers of the Church, and are divided into four Books,\r\nof which the first contains questions concerning God and the\r\ndoctrine of the Trinity in particular; the second is concerning the\r\nCreation; the third, concerning Christ and the Christian Religion;\r\nand the fourth treats of Religious and Moral Duties. In the second\r\nbook, as in many of the writers of this time, the nature of Angels\r\nis considered in detail, and the Orders of their Hierarchy, of which\r\nthere were held to be nine. The physical discussions enter only as\r\nbearing upon the scriptural history of the creation, and cannot be\r\ntaken as a specimen of the work; but I may observe, that in speaking\r\nof the division of the waters above the {232} firmament, he gives\r\none opinion, that of Bede, that the former waters are the solid\r\ncrystalline heavens in which the stars are fixed,[73\\4] \"for\r\ncrystal, which is so hard and transparent, is made of water.\" But he\r\nmentions also the opinion of St. Augustine, that the waters above\r\nthe heavens are in a state of vapor, (_vaporaliter_) and in minute\r\ndrops; \"if, then, water can, as we see in clouds, be so minutely\r\ndivided that it may be thus supported as vapor on air, which is\r\nnaturally lighter than water; why may we not believe that it floats\r\nabove that lighter celestial element in still minuter drops and\r\nstill lighter vapors? But in whatever manner the waters are there,\r\nwe do not doubt that they are there.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\4: Lib. ii. Distinct. xiv. _De opere secundæ diei_.]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated _Summa Theologicæ_ of Thomas Aquinas is a work of the\r\nsame kind; and anything which has a physical bearing forms an\r\nequally small part of it. Thus, of the 512 Questions of the _Summa_,\r\nthere is only one (Part I., Quest. 115), \"on Corporeal Action,\" or\r\non any part of the material world; though there are several\r\nconcerning the celestial Hierarchies, as \"on the Act of Angels,\"\r\n\"on the Speaking of Angels,\" \"on the Subordination of Angels,\"\r\n\"on Guardian Angels,\" and the like. This, of course, would not be\r\nremarkable in a treatise on Theology, except this Theology were\r\nintended to constitute the whole of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe may observe, that in this work, though Plato, Avecibron, and many\r\nother heathen as well as Christian philosophers, are adduced as\r\nauthority, Aristotle is referred to in a peculiar manner as \"the\r\nphilosopher.\" This is noticed by John of Salisbury, as attracting\r\nattention in his time (he died A.D. 1182). \"The various Masters of\r\nDialectic,\" says he,[74\\4] \"shine each with his peculiar merit; but\r\nall are proud to worship the footsteps of Aristotle; so much so,\r\nindeed, that the name of _philosopher_, which belongs to them all, has\r\nbeen pre-eminently appropriated to him. He is called the philosopher\r\n_autonomatice_, that is, by excellence.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\4: _Metalogicus_, lib. ii. cap. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe Question concerning Corporeal Action, in Aquinas, is divided\r\ninto six Articles; and the conclusion delivered upon the first\r\nis,[75\\4] that \"Body being compounded of power and act, is active as\r\nwell as passive.\" Against this it is urged, that quantity is an\r\nattribute of body, and that quantity prevents action; that this\r\nappears in fact, since a larger body is more difficult to move. The\r\nauthor replies, that {233} \"quantity does not prevent corporeal form\r\nfrom action altogether, but prevents it from being a universal\r\nagent, inasmuch as the form is individualized, which, in matter\r\nsubject to quantity, it is. Moreover, the illustration deduced from\r\nthe ponderousness of bodies is not to the purpose; first, because\r\nthe addition of quantity is not the cause of gravity, as is proved\r\nin the fourth book, De Cœlo and De Mundo\" (we see that he quotes\r\nfamiliarly the physical treatises of Aristotle); \"second, because it\r\nis false that ponderousness makes motion slower; on the contrary, in\r\nproportion as any thing is heavier, the more does it move with its\r\nproper motion; thirdly, because action does not take place by local\r\nmotion, as Democritus asserted; but by this, that something is drawn\r\nfrom power into act.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\4: _**Summa_, P. i. Q. 115. Art. 1.]\r\n\r\nIt does not belong to our purpose to consider either the theological\r\nor the metaphysical doctrines which form so large a portion of the\r\ntreatises of the schoolmen. Perhaps it may hereafter appear, that\r\nsome light is thrown on some of the questions which have occupied\r\nmetaphysicians in all ages, by that examination of the history of\r\nthe Progressive Sciences in which we are now engaged; but till we\r\nare able to analyze the leading controversies of this kind, it would\r\nbe of little service to speak of them in detail. It may be noticed,\r\nhowever, that many of the most prominent of them refer to the great\r\nquestion, \"What is the relation between actual things and general\r\nterms?\" Perhaps in modern times, the actual things would be more\r\ncommonly taken as the point to start from; and men would begin by\r\nconsidering how classes and universals are obtained from\r\nindividuals. But the schoolmen, founding their speculations on the\r\nreceived modes of considering such subjects, to which both Aristotle\r\nand Plato had contributed, travelled in the opposite direction, and\r\nendeavored to discover how individuals were deduced from genera and\r\nspecies;--what was \"the Principle of Individuation.\" This was\r\nvariously stated by different reasoners. Thus Bonaventura[76\\4]\r\nsolves the difficulty by the aid of the Aristotelian distinction of\r\nMatter and Form. The individual derives from the Form the property\r\nof _being something_, and from the Matter the property of being that\r\n_particular thing_. Duns Scotus,[77\\4] the great adversary of Thomas\r\nAquinas in theology, placed the principle of Individuation in \"a\r\ncertain determining positive entity,\" which his school called\r\n_Hæcceity_ or _thisness_. \"Thus an individual man is Peter, because\r\nhis _humanity_ is combined with_ Petreity_.\" The force {234} of\r\nabstract terms is a curious question, and some remarkable\r\nexperiments in their use had been made by the Latin Aristotelians\r\nbefore this time. In the same way in which we talk of the _quantity_\r\nand _quality_ of a thing, they spoke of its _quiddity_.[78\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\4: Deg. iv. 573.]\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\4: Ib. iv. 523.]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\4: Deg. iv. 494.]\r\n\r\nWe may consider the reign of mere disputation as fully established\r\nat the time of which we are now speaking; and the only kind of\r\nphilosophy henceforth studied was one in which no sound physical\r\nscience had or could have a place. The wavering abstractions,\r\nindistinct generalizations, and loose classifications of common\r\nlanguage, which we have already noted as the fountain of the physics\r\nof the Greek Schools of philosophy, were also the only source from\r\nwhich the Schoolmen of the middle ages drew their views, or rather\r\ntheir arguments: and though these notional and verbal relations were\r\ninvested with a most complex and pedantic technicality, they did\r\nnot, on that account, become at all more precise as notions, or more\r\nlikely to lead to a single real truth. Instead of acquiring distinct\r\nideas, they multiplied abstract terms; instead of real\r\ngeneralizations, they had recourse to verbal distinctions. The whole\r\ncourse of their employments tended to make them, not only ignorant\r\nof physical truth, but incapable of conceiving its nature.\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken upon themselves the task of raising and discussing\r\nquestions by means of abstract terms, verbal distinctions, and\r\nlogical rules alone, there was no tendency in their activity to come\r\nto an end, as there was no progress. The same questions, the same\r\nanswers, the same difficulties, the same solutions, the same verbal\r\nsubtleties,--sought for, admired, cavilled at, abandoned,\r\nreproduced, and again admired,--might recur without limit. John of\r\nSalisbury[79\\4] observes of the Parisian teachers, that, after\r\nseveral years' absence, he found them not a step advanced, and still\r\nemployed in urging and parrying the same arguments; and this, as Mr.\r\nHallam remarks,[80\\4] \"was equally applicable to the period of\r\ncenturies.\" The same knots were tied and {235} untied; the same\r\nclouds were formed and dissipated. The poet's censure of \"the Sons\r\nof Aristotle,\" is just as happily expressed:\r\n               They stand\r\n    Locked up together hand in hand\r\n    Every one leads as he is led,\r\n    The same bare path they tread,\r\n  And dance like Fairies a fantastic round,\r\n  But neither change their motion nor their ground.\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\4: He studied logic at Paris, at St. Geneviève, and then\r\nleft them. \"Duodecennium mihi elapsum est diversis studiis\r\noccupatum. Jucundum itaque visum est veteres quos reliqueram, et\r\nquos adhuc Dialectica detinebat in monte, (Sanctæ Genovefæ) revisere\r\nsocios, conferre cum eis super ambiguitatibus pristinis; ut nostrûm\r\ninvicem collatione mutuâ commetiremur profectum. Inventi sunt, qui\r\nfuerant, et ubi; neque enim ad palmam visi sunt processisse ad\r\nquæstiones pristinis dirimendas, neque propositiunculam unam\r\nadjecerant. Quibus urgebant stimulis eisdem et ipsi urgebantur,\" &c.\r\n_Metalogicus_, lib. ii. cap. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\4: _Middle Ages_, iii. 537.]\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be unnecessary to go into any detail respecting\r\nthe history of the School Philosophy of the thirteenth, fourteenth,\r\nand fifteenth centuries. We may suppose it to have been, during the\r\nintermediate time, such as it was at first and at last. An occasion\r\nto consider its later days will be brought before us by the course\r\nof our subject. But, even during the most entire ascendency of the\r\nscholastic doctrines, the elements of change were at work. While the\r\ndoctors and the philosophers received all the ostensible homage of\r\nmen, a doctrine and a philosophy of another kind were gradually\r\nforming: the practical instincts of man, their impatience of\r\ntyranny, the progress of the useful arts, the promises of alchemy,\r\nwere all disposing men to reject the authority and deny the\r\npretensions of the received philosophical creed. Two antagonist\r\nforms of opinion were in existence, which for some time went on\r\ndetached, and almost independent of each other; but, finally, these\r\ncame into conflict, at the time of Galileo; and the war speedily\r\nextended to every part of civilized Europe.\r\n\r\n3. _Scholastic Physics._--It is difficult to give briefly any\r\nappropriate examples of the nature of the Aristotelian physics which\r\nare to be found in the works of this time. As the gravity of bodies\r\nwas one of the first subjects of dispute when the struggle of the\r\nrival methods began, we may notice the mode in which it was\r\ntreated.[81\\4] \"Zabarella maintains that the proximate cause of the\r\nmotion of elements is the _form_, in the Aristotelian sense of the\r\nterm: but to this sentence we,\" says Keckerman, \"cannot agree; for\r\nin all other things the _form_ is the proximate cause, not of the\r\n_act_, but of the power or faculty from which the act flows. Thus in\r\nman, the rational soul is not the cause of the act of laughing, but\r\nof the risible faculty or power.\" Keckerman's system was at one time\r\na work of considerable authority: it was published in 1614. By\r\ncomparing and systematizing what he finds in Aristotle, he is led to\r\nstate his results in the form of definitions {236} and theorems.\r\nThus, \"gravity is a motive quality, arising from cold, density, and\r\nbulk, by which the elements are carried downwards.\" \"Water is the\r\nlower, intermediate element, cold and moist.\" The first theorem\r\nconcerning water is, \"The moistness of the water is controlled by\r\nits coldness, so that it is less than the moistness of the air;\r\nthough, according to the sense of the vulgar, water appears to\r\nmoisten more than air.\" It is obvious that the two properties of\r\nfluids, to have their parts easily moved, and to wet other bodies,\r\nare here confounded. I may, as a concluding specimen of this kind,\r\nmention those propositions or maxims concerning fluids, which were\r\nso firmly established, that, when Boyle propounded the true\r\nmechanical principles of fluid action, he was obliged to state his\r\nopinions as \"hydrostatical _paradoxes_.\" These were,--that fluids do\r\nnot gravitate _in proprio loco_; that is, that water has no gravity\r\nin or on water, since it is in its own place;--that air has no\r\ngravity on water, since it is above water, which is its proper\r\nplace;--that earth in water tends to descend, since its place is\r\nbelow water;--that the water rises in a pump or siphon, because\r\nnature abhors a vacuum;--that some bodies have a positive levity in\r\nothers, as oil in water; and the like.\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\4: Keckerman, p. 1428.]\r\n\r\n4. _Authority of Aristotle among the Schoolmen._--The authority of\r\nAristotle, and the practice of making him the text and basis of the\r\nsystem, especially as it regarded physics, prevailed during the period\r\nof which we speak. This authority was not, however, without its\r\nfluctuations. Launoy has traced one part of its history in a book _On\r\nthe various Fortune of Aristotle in the University of Paris_. The most\r\nmaterial turns of this fortune depend on the bearing which the works\r\nof Aristotle were supposed to have upon theology. Several of\r\nAristotle's works, and more especially his metaphysical writings, had\r\nbeen translated into Latin, and were explained in the schools of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, as early as the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.[82\\4] At a council held at Paris in 1209, they were\r\nprohibited, as having given occasion to the heresy of Almeric (or\r\nAmauri), and because \"they might give occasion to other heresies not\r\nyet invented.\" The Logic of Aristotle recovered its credit some years\r\nafter this, and was publicly taught in the University of Paris in the\r\nyear 1215; but the Natural Philosophy and Metaphysics were prohibited\r\nby a decree of Gregory the Ninth, in 1231. The Emperor Frederic the\r\nSecond employed a number of learned men to translate into Latin, from\r\nthe Greek and {237} Arabic, certain books of Aristotle, and of other\r\nancient sages; and we have a letter of Peter de Vineis, in which they\r\nare recommended to the attention of the University of Bologna:\r\nprobably the same recommendation was addressed to other Universities.\r\nBoth Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas wrote commentaries on\r\nAristotle's works; and as this was done soon after the decree of\r\nGregory the Ninth, Launoy is much perplexed to reconcile the fact with\r\nthe orthodoxy of the two doctors. Campanella, who was one of the first\r\nto cast off the authority of Aristotle, says, \"We are by no means to\r\nthink that St. Thomas _aristotelized_; he only expounded Aristotle,\r\nthat he might correct his errors; and I should conceive he did this\r\nwith the license of the Pope.\" This statement, however, by no means\r\ngives a just view of the nature of Albertus's and Aquinas's\r\ncommentaries. Both have followed their author with profound\r\ndeference.[83\\4] For instance, Aquinas[84\\4] attempts to defend\r\nAristotle's assertion, that if there were no resistance, a body would\r\nmove through a space in no time; and the same defence is given by\r\nScotus.\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\4: Mosheim, iii. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\4: Deg. N. 475.]\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\4: F. Piccolomini, ii. 835.]\r\n\r\nWe may imagine the extent of authority and admiration which\r\nAristotle would attain, when thus countenanced, both by the powerful\r\nand the learned. In universities, no degree could be taken without a\r\nknowledge of the philosopher. In 1452, Cardinal Totaril established\r\nthis rule in the University of Paris.[85\\4] When Ramus, in 1543,\r\npublished an attack upon Aristotle, it was repelled by the power of\r\nthe court, and the severity of the law. Francis the First published\r\nan edict, in which he states that he had appointed certain judges,\r\nwho had been of opinion,[86\\4] \"que le dit Ramus avoit été\r\ntéméraire, arrogant et impudent; et que parcequ'en son livre des\r\nanimadversions il reprenait Aristotle, estait évidemment connue et\r\nmanifeste son ignorance.\" The books are then declared to be\r\nsuppressed. It was often a complaint of pious men, that theology was\r\ncorrupted by the influence of Aristotle and his commentators.\r\nPetrarch says,[87\\4] that one of the Italian learned men conversing\r\nwith him, after expressing much contempt for the apostles and\r\nfathers, exclaimed, \"Utinam tu Averroen pati posses, ut videres\r\nquanto ille tuis his nugatoribus major sit!\"\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\4: Launoy, pp. 108, 128.]\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\4: Launoy, p. 132.]\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\4: Hallam, _M. A._ iii. 536.]\r\n\r\nWhen the revival of letters began to take place, and a number of men\r\nof ardent and elegant minds, susceptible to the impressions of\r\nbeauty of style and dignity of thought, were brought into contact\r\nwith Greek literature, Plato had naturally greater charms for them.\r\nA {238} powerful school of Platonists (not Neoplatonists) was formed\r\nin Italy, including some of the principal scholars and men of genius\r\nof the time; as Picus of Mirandula in the middle, Marsilius Ficinus\r\nat the end, of the fifteenth century. At one time, it appeared as if\r\nthe ascendency of Aristotle was about to be overturned; but, in\r\nphysics at least, his authority passed unshaken through this trial.\r\nIt was not by disputation that Aristotle could be overthrown; and\r\nthe Platonists were not persons whose doctrines led them to use the\r\nonly decisive method in such cases, the observation and unfettered\r\ninterpretation of facts.\r\n\r\nThe history of their controversies, therefore, does not belong to\r\nour design. For like reasons we do not here speak of other authors,\r\nwho opposed the scholastic philosophy on general theoretical grounds\r\nof various kinds. Such examples of insurrection against the\r\ndogmatism which we have been reviewing, are extremely interesting\r\nevents in the history of the philosophy of science. But, in the\r\npresent work, we are to confine ourselves to the history of science\r\nitself; in the hope that we may thus be able, hereafter, to throw a\r\nsteadier light upon that philosophy by which the succession of\r\nstationary and progressive periods, which we are here tracing, may be\r\nin some measure explained. We are now to close our account of the\r\nstationary period, and to enter upon the great subject of the\r\nprogress of physical science in modern times.\r\n\r\n5. _Subjects omitted. Civil Law, Medicine._--My object has been to\r\nmake my way, as rapidly as possible, to this period of progress; and\r\nin doing this, I have had to pass over a long and barren track,\r\nwhere almost all traces of the right road disappear. In exploring\r\nthis region, it is not without some difficulty that he who is\r\ntravelling with objects such as mine, continues a steady progress in\r\nthe proper direction; for many curious and attractive subjects of\r\nresearch come in his way: he crosses the track of many a\r\ncontroversy, which in its time divided the world of speculators, and\r\nof which the results may be traced, even now, in the conduct of\r\nmoral, or political, or metaphysical discussions; or in the common\r\nassociations of thought, and forms of language. The wars of the\r\nNominalists and Realists; the disputes concerning the foundations of\r\nmorals, and the motives of human actions; the controversies\r\nconcerning predestination, free will, grace, and the many other\r\npoints of metaphysical divinity; the influence of theology and\r\nmetaphysics upon each other, and upon other subjects of human\r\ncuriosity; the effects of opinion upon politics, and of political\r\ncondition upon opinion; the influence of literature and philosophy\r\n{239} upon each other, and upon society; and many other\r\nsubjects;--might be well worth examination, if our hope of success\r\ndid not reside in pursuing, steadily and directly, those inquiries\r\nin which we can look for a definite and certain reply. We must even\r\nneglect two of the leading studies of those times, which occupied\r\nmuch of men's time and thoughts, and had a very great influence on\r\nsociety; the one dealing with Notions, the other with Things; the\r\none employed about moral rules, the other about material causes, but\r\nboth for practical ends; I mean, the study of the _Civil Law_, and\r\nof _Medicine_. The second of these studies will hereafter come\r\nbefore us, as one of the principal occasions which led to the\r\ncultivation of chemistry; but, in itself, its progress is of too\r\ncomplex and indefinite a nature to be advantageously compared with\r\nthat of the more exact sciences. The Roman Law is held, by its\r\nadmirers, to be a system of deductive science, as exact as the\r\nmathematical sciences themselves; and it may, therefore, be useful\r\nto consider it, if we should, in the sequel, have to examine how far\r\nthere can exist an analogy between moral and physical science. But,\r\nafter a few more words on the middle ages, we must return to our\r\ntask of tracing the progress of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE ARTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nART AND SCIENCE.--I shall, before I resume the history of science, say\r\na few words on the subject described in the title of this chapter,\r\nboth because I might otherwise be accused of doing injustice to the\r\nperiod now treated of; and also, because we shall by this means bring\r\nunder our notice some circumstances which were important as being the\r\nharbingers of the revival of progressive knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe accusation of injustice towards the state of science in the\r\nmiddle ages, if we were to terminate our survey of them with what\r\nhas hitherto been said, might be urged from obvious topics. How do\r\nwe recognize, it might be asked, in a picture of mere confusion and\r\nmysticism of thought, of servility and dogmatism of character, the\r\npowers and acquirements to which we owe so many of the most\r\nimportant inventions which we now enjoy? Parchment and paper,\r\nprinting and engraving, improved glass and steel, gunpowder, clocks,\r\ntelescopes, {240} the mariner's compass, the reformed calendar, the\r\ndecimal notation, algebra, trigonometry, chemistry, counterpoint, an\r\ninvention equivalent to a new creation of music;--these are all\r\npossessions which we inherit from that which has been so\r\ndisparagingly termed the Stationary Period. Above all, let us look\r\nat the monuments of architecture of this period;--the admiration and\r\nthe despair of modern architects, not only for their beauty, but for\r\nthe skill disclosed in their construction. With all these evidences\r\nbefore us, how can we avoid allowing that the masters of the middle\r\nages not only made some small progress in Astronomy, which has,\r\ngrudgingly as it would seem, been admitted in a former Book; but\r\nalso that they were no small proficients in other sciences, in\r\nOptics, in Harmonics, in Physics, and, above all, in Mechanics?\r\n\r\nIf, it may be added, we are allowed, in the present day, to refer to\r\nthe perfection of our arts as evidence of the advanced state of our\r\nphysical philosophy;--if our steam-engines, our gas-illumination, our\r\nbuildings, our navigation, our manufactures, are cited as triumphs of\r\nscience;--shall not prior inventions, made under far heavier\r\ndisadvantages,--shall not greater works, produced in an earlier state\r\nof knowledge, also be admitted as witnesses that the middle ages had\r\ntheir share, and that not a small or doubtful one, of science?\r\n\r\nTo these questions I answer, by distinguishing between Art, and\r\nScience in that sense of general Inductive Systematic Truth, which\r\nit bears in this work. To separate and compare, with precision,\r\nthese two processes, belongs to the Philosophy of Induction; and the\r\nattempt must be reserved for another place: but the leading\r\ndifferences are sufficiently obvious. Art is practical, Science is\r\nspeculative: the former is seen in doing; the latter rests in the\r\ncontemplation of what is known. The Art of the builder appears in\r\nhis edifice, though he may never have meditated on the abstract\r\npropositions on which its stability and strength depends. The\r\nScience of the mathematical mechanician consists in his seeing that,\r\nunder certain conditions, bodies must sustain each other's pressure,\r\nthough he may never have applied his knowledge in a single case.\r\n\r\nNow the remark which I have to make is this:--in all cases the Arts\r\nare prior to the related Sciences. Art is the parent, not the\r\nprogeny, of Science; the realization of principles in practice forms\r\npart of the prelude, as well as of the sequel, of theoretical\r\ndiscovery. And thus the inventions of the middle ages, which have\r\nbeen above enumerated, though at the present day they may be\r\nportions of our sciences, are no evidence that the sciences then\r\nexisted; but only that {241} those powers of practical observation\r\nand practical skill were at work, which prepare the way for\r\ntheoretical views and scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, that the great works of art do virtually take for\r\ngranted principles of science; and that, therefore, it is unreasonable\r\nto deny science to great artists. It may be said, that the grand\r\nstructures of Cologne, or Amiens, or Canterbury, could not have been\r\nerected without a profound knowledge of mechanical principles.\r\n\r\nTo this we reply, that _such_ knowledge is manifestly not of the\r\nnature of that which we call _science_. If the beautiful and skilful\r\nstructures of the middle ages prove that mechanics then existed as a\r\nscience, mechanics must have existed as a science also among the\r\nbuilders of the Cyclopean walls of Greece and Italy, or of our own\r\nStonehenge; for the masses which are there piled on each other, could\r\nnot be raised without considerable mechanical skill. But we may go\r\nmuch further. The actions of every man who raises and balances\r\nweights, or walks along a pole, take for granted the laws of\r\nequilibrium; and even animals constantly avail themselves of such\r\nprinciples. Are these, then, acquainted with mechanics as a science?\r\nAgain, if actions which are performed by taking advantage of\r\nmechanical properties prove a knowledge of the science of mechanics,\r\nthey must also be allowed to prove a knowledge of the science of\r\ngeometry, when they proceed on geometrical properties. But the most\r\nfamiliar actions of men and animals proceed upon geometrical truths.\r\nThe Epicureans held, as Proclus informs us, that even asses knew that\r\ntwo sides of a triangle are greater than the third. And animals may\r\ntruly be said to have a practical knowledge of this truth; but they\r\nhave not, therefore, a science of geometry. And in like manner among\r\nmen, if we consider the matter strictly, a practical assumption of a\r\nprinciple does not imply a speculative knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nWe may, in another way also, show how inadmissible are the works of\r\nthe Master Artists of the middle ages into the series of events which\r\nmark the advance of Science. The following maxim is applicable to a\r\nhistory, such as we are here endeavoring to write. We are employed in\r\ntracing the progress of such general principles as constitute each of\r\nthe sciences which we are reviewing; and no facts or subordinate\r\ntruths belong to our scheme, except so far as they tend to or are\r\nincluded in these higher principles; nor are they important to us, any\r\nfurther than as they prove such principles. Now with regard to\r\nprocesses of art like those which we have referred to, namely, the\r\ninventions of the middle ages, let us ask, _what_ principle each of\r\nthem {242} illustrates? What chemical doctrine rests for its support\r\non the phenomena of gunpowder, or glass, or steel? What new harmonical\r\ntruth was illustrated in the Gregorian chant? What mechanical\r\nprinciple unknown to Archimedes was displayed in the printing-press?\r\nThe practical value and use, the ingenuity and skill of these\r\ninventions is not questioned; but what is their place in the history\r\nof speculative knowledge? Even in those cases in which they enter into\r\nsuch a history, how minute a figure do they make! how great is the\r\ncontrast between their practical and theoretical importance! They may\r\nin their operation have changed the face of the world; but in the\r\nhistory of the principles of the sciences to which they belong, they\r\nmay be omitted without being missed.\r\n\r\nAs to that part of the objection which was stated by asking, why, if\r\nthe arts of our age prove its scientific eminence, the arts of the\r\nmiddle ages should not be received as proof of theirs; we must reply\r\nto it, by giving up some of the pretensions which are often put\r\nforwards on behalf of the science of our times. The perfection of\r\nthe mechanical and other arts among us proves the advanced condition\r\nof our sciences, only in so far as these arts have been perfected by\r\nthe application of some great scientific truth, with a clear insight\r\ninto its nature. The greatest improvement of the steam-engine was\r\ndue to the steady apprehension of an atmological doctrine by Watt;\r\nbut what distinct theoretical principle is illustrated by the\r\nbeautiful manufactures of porcelain, or steel, or glass? A chemical\r\nview of these compounds, which would explain the conditions of\r\nsuccess and failure in their manufacture, would be of great value in\r\nart; and it would also be a novelty in chemical theory; so little is\r\nthe present condition of those processes a triumph of science,\r\nshedding intellectual glory on our age. And the same might be said\r\nof many, or of most, of the processes of the arts as now practised.\r\n\r\n2. _Arabian Science._--Having, I trust, established the view I have\r\nstated, respecting the relation of Art and Science, we shall be able\r\nvery rapidly to dispose of a number of subjects which otherwise\r\nmight seem to require a detailed notice. Though this distinction has\r\nbeen recognized by others, it has hardly been rigorously adhered to,\r\nin consequence of the indistinct notion of _science_ which has\r\ncommonly prevailed. Thus Gibbon, in speaking of the knowledge of the\r\nperiod now under our notice, says,[88\\4] \"Much useful experience had\r\nbeen acquired in {243} the practice of arts and manufactures; but\r\nthe _science_ of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the\r\nindustry of the Saracens. They,\" he adds, \"first invented and named\r\nthe alembic for the purposes of distillation, analyzed the\r\nsubstances of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction\r\nand affinities of alkalies and acids, and converted the poisonous\r\nminerals into soft and salutary medicines.\" The formation and\r\nrealization of the notions of _analysis_ and of _affinity_, were\r\nimportant steps in chemical science, which, as I shall hereafter\r\nendeavor to show, it remained for the chemists of Europe to make at\r\na much later period. If the Arabians had done this, they might with\r\njustice have been called the authors of the science of chemistry;\r\nbut no doctrines can be adduced from their works which give them any\r\ntitle to this eminent distinction. Their claims are dissipated at\r\nonce by the application of the maxim above stated. _What_ analysis\r\nof theirs tended to establish any received principle of chemistry?\r\n_What_ true doctrine concerning the differences and affinities of\r\nacids and alkalies did they teach? We need not wonder if Gibbon,\r\nwhose views of the boundaries of scientific chemistry were probably\r\nvery wide and indistinct, could include the arts of the Arabians\r\nwithin its domain; but they cannot pass the frontier of science if\r\nphilosophically defined, and steadily guarded.\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\4: _Decline and Fall_, vol. x. p. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe judgment which we are thus led to form respecting the chemical\r\nknowledge of the middle ages, and of the Arabians in particular, may\r\nserve to measure the condition of science in other departments; for\r\nchemistry has justly been considered one of their strongest points.\r\nIn botany, anatomy, zoology, optics, acoustics, we have still the\r\nsame observations to make, that the steps in science which, in the\r\norder of progress, next followed what the Greeks had done, were left\r\nfor the Europeans of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The\r\nmerits and advances of the Arabian philosophers in astronomy and\r\npure mathematics, we have already described.\r\n\r\n3. _Experimental Philosophy of the Arabians._--The estimate to which\r\nwe have thus been led, of the scientific merits of the learned men\r\nof the middle ages, is much less exalted than that which has been\r\nformed by many writers; and, among the rest, by some of our own\r\ntime. But I am persuaded that any attempt to answer the questions\r\njust asked, will expose the untenable nature of the higher claims\r\nwhich have been advanced in favor of the Arabians. We can deliver no\r\njust decision, except we will consent to use the terms of science in\r\na strict and precise sense: and if we do this, we shall find little,\r\neither in the {244} particular discoveries or general processes of\r\nthe Arabians, which is important in the history of the Inductive\r\nSciences.[89\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\4: If I might take the liberty of criticising an author who\r\nhas given a very interesting view of the period in question\r\n(_Mahometanism Unveiled_, by the Rev. Charles Forster, 1829), I\r\nwould remark, that in his work this caution is perhaps too little\r\nobserved. Thus, he says, in speaking of Alhazen (vol. ii. p. 270),\r\n\"the theory of the telescope may be found in the work of this\r\nastronomer;\" and of another, \"the uses of magnifying glasses and\r\ntelescopes, and the principle of their construction, are explained\r\nin the Great Work of (Roger) Bacon, with a truth and clearness which\r\nhave commanded universal admiration.\" Such phrases would be much too\r\nstrong, even if used respecting the optical doctrines of Kepler,\r\nwhich were yet incomparably more true and clear than those of Bacon.\r\nTo employ such language, in such cases, is to deprive such terms as\r\n_theory_ and _principle_ of all meaning.]\r\n\r\nThe credit due to the Arabians for improvements in the general\r\nmethods of philosophizing, is a more difficult question; and cannot\r\nbe discussed at length by us, till we examine the history of such\r\nmethods in the abstract, which, in the present work, it is not our\r\nintention to do.  But we may observe, that we cannot agree with\r\nthose who rank their merits high in this respect. We have already\r\nseen, that their minds were completely devoured by the worst habits\r\nof the stationary period,--Mysticism and Commentation. They followed\r\ntheir Greek leaders, for the most part, with abject servility, and\r\nwith only that kind of acuteness and independent speculation which\r\nthe Commentator's vocation implies. And in their choice of the\r\nstandard subjects of their studies, they fixed upon those works, the\r\nPhysical Books of Aristotle, which have never promoted the progress\r\nof science, except in so far as they incited men to refute them; an\r\neffect which they never produced on the Arabians. That the Arabian\r\nastronomers made some advances beyond the Greeks, we have already\r\nstated: the two great instances are, the discovery of the Motion of\r\nthe Sun's Apogee by Albategnius, and the discovery (recently brought\r\nto light) of the existence of the Moon's Second Inequality, by Aboul\r\nWefa. But we cannot but observe in how different a manner they\r\ntreated these discoveries, from that with which Hipparchus or\r\nPtolemy would have done. The Variation of the Moon, in particular,\r\ninstead of being incorporated into the system by means of an\r\nEpicycle, as Ptolemy had done with the Evection, was allowed, almost\r\nimmediately, so far as we can judge, to fall into neglect and\r\noblivion: so little were the learned Arabians prepared to take their\r\nlessons from observation as well as from books. That in many\r\nsubjects they made experiments, may easily be allowed: there never\r\nwas a period of the earth's history, and least of all a period of\r\ncommerce {245} and manufactures, luxury and art, medicine and\r\nengineering, in which there were not going on innumerable processes,\r\nwhich may be termed Experiments; and, in addition to these, the\r\nArabians adopted the pursuit of alchemy, and the love of exotic\r\nplants and animals. But so far from their being, as has been\r\nmaintained,[90\\4] a people whose \"experimental intellect\" fitted\r\nthem to form sciences which the \"abstract intellect\" of the Greeks\r\nfailed in producing, it rather appears, that several of the sciences\r\nwhich the Greeks had founded, were never even comprehended by the\r\nArabians. I do not know any evidence that these pupils ever attained\r\nto understand the real principles of Mechanics, Hydrostatics, and\r\nHarmonics, which their masters had established. At any rate, when\r\nthese sciences again became progressive, Europe had to start where\r\nEurope had stopped. There is no Arabian name which any one has\r\nthought of interposing between Archimedes the ancient, and Stevinus\r\nand Galileo the moderns.\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\4: _Mahometanism Unveiled_, ii. 271.]\r\n\r\n4. _Roger Bacon._--There is one writer of the middle ages, on whom\r\nmuch stress has been laid, and who was certainly a most remarkable\r\nperson. Roger Bacon's works are not only so far beyond his age in\r\nthe knowledge which they contain, but so different from the temper\r\nof the times, in his assertion of the supremacy of experiment, and\r\nin his contemplation of the future progress of knowledge, that it is\r\ndifficult to conceive how such a character could then exist. That he\r\nreceived much of his knowledge from Arabic writers, there can be no\r\ndoubt; for they were in his time the repositories of all\r\ntraditionary knowledge. But that he derived from them his\r\ndisposition to shake off the authority of Aristotle, to maintain the\r\nimportance of experiment, and to look upon knowledge as in its\r\ninfancy, I cannot believe, because I have not myself hit upon, nor\r\nseen quoted by others, any passages in which Arabian writers express\r\nsuch a disposition. On the other hand, we do find in European\r\nwriters, in the authors of Greece and Rome, the solid sense, the\r\nbold and hopeful spirit, which suggest such tendencies. We have\r\nalready seen that Aristotle asserts, as distinctly as words can\r\nexpress, that all knowledge must depend on observation, and that\r\nscience must be collected from facts by induction. We have seen,\r\ntoo, that the Roman writers, and Seneca in particular, speak with an\r\nenthusiastic confidence of the progress which science must make in\r\nthe course of ages. When Roger Bacon holds similar language in the\r\nthirteenth century, the resemblance is probably rather a sympathy of\r\ncharacter, than a matter of direct derivation; but I know of nothing\r\n{246} which proves even so much as this sympathy in the case of\r\nArabian philosophers.\r\n\r\nA good deal has been said of late of the coincidences between his\r\nviews, and those of his great namesake in later times, Francis\r\nBacon.[91\\4] The resemblances consist mainly in such points as I\r\nhave just noticed; and we cannot but acknowledge, that many of the\r\nexpressions of the Franciscan Friar remind us of the large thoughts\r\nand lofty phrases of the Philosophical Chancellor. How far the one\r\ncan be considered as having anticipated the method of the other, we\r\nshall examine more advantageously, when we come to consider what the\r\ncharacter and effect of Francis Bacon's works really are.[92\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\4: Hallam's _Middle Ages_, iii. 549. Forster's _Mahom. U._\r\nii. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\4: In the _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, I have\r\ngiven an account at considerable length of Roger Bacon's mode of\r\ntreating Arts and Sciences; and have also compared more fully his\r\nphilosophy with that of Francis Bacon; and I have given a view of\r\nthe bearing of this latter upon the progress of Science in modern\r\ntimes.

I mean\r\ntheir practical architecture, and their architectural treatises.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter of this book, we have endeavored to explain how\r\nthe indistinctness of ideas, which attended the decline of the Roman\r\nempire, appears in the forms of their architecture;--in the disregard,\r\nwhich the decorative construction exhibits, of the necessary\r\nmechanical conditions of support. The original scheme of Greek\r\nornamental architecture had been horizontal masses resting on vertical\r\ncolumns: when the arch was introduced by the Romans, it was concealed,\r\nor kept in a state of subordination: and the lateral support which it\r\nrequired was supplied latently, marked by some artifice. But the\r\nstruggle between the _mechanical_ and the _decorative\r\nconstruction_[93\\4] ended in the complete disorganization of the\r\nclassical style. The {247} inconsistencies and extravagances of which\r\nwe have noticed the occurrence, were results and indications of the\r\nfall of good architecture. The elements of the ancient system had lost\r\nall principle of connection and regard to rule. Building became not\r\nonly a mere art, but an art exercised by masters without skill, and\r\nwithout feeling for real beauty.\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\4: See Mr. Willis's admirable _Remarks on the Architecture\r\nof the Middle Ages_, chap. ii.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of my first edition, Mr. Willis has shown that\r\nmuch of the \"mason-craft\" of the middle ages consisted in the\r\ngeometrical methods by which the artists wrought out of the blocks\r\nthe complex forms of their decorative system.\r\n\r\nTo the general indistinctness of speculative notions on mechanical\r\nsubjects prevalent in the middle ages, there may have been some\r\nexceptions, and especially so long as there were readers of\r\nArchimedes. Boëthius had translated the mechanical works of\r\nArchimedes into Latin, as we learn from the enumeration of his works\r\nby his friend Cassiodorus (_Variar._ lib i. cap. 45), \"_Mechanicum_\r\netiam Archimedem latialem siculis reddidisti.\" But _Mechanicus_ was\r\nused in those times rather for one skilled in the art of\r\nconstructing wonderful machines than in the speculative theory of\r\nthem. The letter from which the quotation is taken is sent by King\r\nTheodoric to Boëthius, to urge him to send the king a water-clock.]\r\n\r\nWhen, after this deep decline, architecture rose again, as it did in\r\nthe twelfth and succeeding centuries, in the exquisitely beautiful\r\nand skilful forms of the Gothic style, what was the nature of the\r\nchange which had taken place, so far as it bears upon the progress\r\nof science? It was this:--the idea of true mechanical relations in\r\nan edifice had been revived in men's minds, as far as was requisite\r\nfor the purposes of art and beauty: and this, though a very\r\ndifferent thing from the possession of the idea as an element of\r\nspeculative science, was the proper preparation for that\r\nacquisition. The notion of support and stability again became\r\nconspicuous in the decorative construction, and universal in the\r\nforms of building. The eye which, looking for beauty in definite and\r\nsignificant relations of parts, is never satisfied except the\r\nweights appear to be duly supported,[94\\4] was again gratified.\r\nArchitecture threw off its barbarous characters: a new decorative\r\nconstruction was matured, not thwarting and controlling, but\r\nassisting and harmonizing with the mechanical construction. All the\r\nornamental parts were made to enter into the apparent construction.\r\nEvery member, almost every moulding, became a sustainer of weight;\r\nand by the multiplicity of props assisting each other, and the\r\nconsequent subdivision of weight, the eye was satisfied of the\r\nstability of the structure, notwithstanding the curiously-slender\r\nforms of the separate parts. The arch and the vault, no longer\r\ntrammelled by an incompatible system of decoration, but favoured by\r\nmore tractable forms, were only limited by the skill of the\r\nbuilders. Everything showed that, practically at least, men\r\npossessed and applied, with steadiness and pleasure, the idea of\r\nmechanical pressure and support.\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\4: Willis, pp. 15-21. I have throughout this description of\r\nthe formation of the Gothic style availed myself of Mr. Willis's\r\nwell-chosen expressions.]\r\n\r\nThe possession of this idea, as a principle of art, led, in the\r\ncourse of time, to its speculative development as the foundation of\r\na science; {248} and thus Architecture prepared the way for\r\nMechanics. But this advance required several centuries. The interval\r\nbetween the admirable cathedrals of Salisbury, Amiens, Cologne, and\r\nthe mechanical treatises of Stevinus, is not less than three hundred\r\nyears. During this time, men were advancing towards science; but in\r\nthe mean time, and perhaps from the very beginning of the time, art\r\nhad begun to decline. The buildings of the fifteenth century,\r\nerected when the principles of mechanical support were just on the\r\nverge of being enunciated in general terms, exhibit those principles\r\nwith a far less impressive simplicity and elegance than those of the\r\nthirteenth. We may hereafter inquire whether we find any other\r\nexamples to countenance the belief, that the formation of Science is\r\ncommonly accompanied by the decline of Art.\r\n\r\nThe leading principle of the style of the Gothic edifices was, not\r\nmerely that the weights were supported, but that they were seen to\r\nbe so; and that not only the mechanical relations of the larger\r\nmasses, but of the smaller members also, were displayed. Hence we\r\ncannot admit, as an origin or anticipation of the Gothic, a style in\r\nwhich this principle is not manifested. I do not see, in any of the\r\nrepresentations of the early Arabic buildings, that distribution of\r\nweights to supports, and that mechanical consistency of parts, which\r\nwould elevate them above the character of barbarous architecture.\r\nTheir masses are broken into innumerable members, without\r\nsubordination or meaning, in a manner suggested apparently by\r\ncaprice and the love of the marvellous. \"In the construction of\r\ntheir mosques, it was a favorite artifice of the Arabs to sustain\r\nimmense and ponderous masses of stone by the support of pillars so\r\nslender, that the incumbent weight seemed, as it were, suspended in\r\nthe air by an invisible hand.\"[95\\4] This pleasure in the\r\ncontemplation of apparent impossibilities is a very general\r\ndisposition among mankind; but it appears to belong to the infancy,\r\nrather than the maturity of intellect. On the other hand, the\r\npleasure in the contemplation of what is clear, the craving for a\r\nthorough insight into the reasons of things, which marks the\r\nEuropean mind, is the temper which leads to science.\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\4: _Mahometanism Unveiled_, ii. 255.]\r\n\r\n6. _Treatises on Architecture._--No one who has attended to the\r\narchitecture which prevailed in England, France, and Germany, from\r\nthe twelfth to the fifteenth century, so far as to comprehend its\r\nbeauty, harmony, consistency, and uniformity, even in the minutest\r\nparts and most obscure relations, can look upon it otherwise than as\r\na {249} remarkably connected and definite artificial system. Nor can\r\nwe doubt that it was exercised by a class of artists who formed\r\nthemselves by laborious study and practice, and by communication\r\nwith each other. There must have been bodies of masters and of\r\nscholars, discipline, traditions, precepts of art. How these\r\nassociated artists diffused themselves over Europe, and whether\r\nhistory enables us to trace them in a distinct form, I shall not\r\nhere discuss. But the existence of a course of instruction, and of a\r\nbody of rules of practice, is proved beyond dispute by the great\r\nseries of European cathedrals and churches, so nearly identical in\r\ntheir general arrangements, and in their particular details. The\r\nquestion then occurs, have these rules and this system of\r\ninstruction anywhere been committed to writing? Can we, by such\r\nevidence, trace the progress of the scientific idea, of which we see\r\nthe working in these buildings?\r\n\r\nWe are not to be surprised, if, during the most flourishing and\r\nvigorous period of the art of the middle ages, we find none of its\r\nprecepts in books. Art has, in all ages and countries, been taught\r\nand transmitted by practice and verbal tradition, not by writing. It\r\nis only in our own times, that the thought occurs as familiar, of\r\ncommitting to books all that we wish to preserve and convey. And,\r\neven in our own times, most of the Arts are learned far more by\r\npractice, and by intercourse with practitioners, than by reading.\r\nSuch is the case, not only with Manufactures and Handicrafts, but\r\nwith the Fine Arts, with Engineering, and even yet, with that art,\r\nBuilding, of which we are now speaking.\r\n\r\nWe are not, therefore, to wonder, if we have no treatises on\r\nArchitecture belonging to the great period of the Gothic\r\nmasters;--or if it appears to have required some other incitement\r\nand some other help, besides their own possession of their practical\r\nskill, to lead them to shape into a literary form the precepts of\r\nthe art which they knew so well how to exercise:--or if, when they\r\ndid write on such subjects, they seem, instead of delivering their\r\nown sound practical principles, to satisfy themselves with pursuing\r\nsome of the frivolous notions and speculations which were then\r\ncurrent in the world of letters.\r\n\r\nSuch appears to be the case. The earliest treatises on Architecture\r\ncome before us under the form which the commentatorial spirit of the\r\nmiddle ages inspired. They are Translations of Vitruvius, with\r\nAnnotations. In some of these, particularly that of Cesare\r\nCesariano, published at Como, in 1521, we see, in a very curious\r\nmanner, how the habit of assuming that, in every department of\r\nliterature, the ancients {250} must needs be their masters, led\r\nthese writers to subordinate the members of their own architecture\r\nto the precepts of the Roman author. We have Gothic shafts,\r\nmouldings, and arrangements, given as parallelisms to others, which\r\nprofess to represent the Roman style, but which are, in fact,\r\nexamples of that mixed manner which is called the style of the\r\n_Cinque cento_ by the Italians, of the _Renaissance_ by the French,\r\nand which is commonly included in our _Elizabethan_. But in the\r\nearly architectural works, besides the superstitions and mistaken\r\nerudition which thus choked the growth of real architectural\r\ndoctrines, another of the peculiar elements of the middle ages comes\r\ninto view;--its mysticism. The dimensions and positions of the\r\nvarious parts of edifices and of their members, are determined by\r\ndrawing triangles, squares, circles, and other figures, in such a\r\nmanner as to bound them; and to these geometrical figures were\r\nassigned many abstruse significations. The plan and the front of the\r\nCathedral at Milan are thus represented in Cesariano's work, bounded\r\nand subdivided by various equilateral triangles; and it is easy to\r\nsee, in the earnestness with which he points out these relations,\r\nthe evidence of a fanciful and mystical turn of thought.[96\\4]\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\4: The plan which he has given, fol. 14, he has entitled\r\n\"Ichnographia Fundamenti sacræ Ædis baricephalæ, Germanico more, à\r\nTrigono ac Pariquadrato perstructa, uti etiam ea quæ nunc Milani\r\nvidetur.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of Cesariano was translated into German by Gualter Rivius,\r\nand published at Nuremberg, in 1548, under the title of _Vitruvius\r\nTeutsch_, with copies of the Italian diagrams. A few years ago, in an\r\narticle in the _Wiener Jahrbücher_ (Oct.-Dec., 1821), the reviewer\r\nmaintained, on the authority of the diagrams in Rivius's book, that\r\nGothic architecture had its origin in Germany and not in England.]\r\n\r\nWe thus find erudition and mysticism take the place of much of that\r\ndevelopment of the architectural principles of the middle ages which\r\nwould be so interesting to us. Still, however, these works are by no\r\nmeans without their value. Indeed many of the arts appear to\r\nflourish not at all the worse, for being treated in a manner\r\nsomewhat mystical; and it may easily be, that the relations of\r\ngeometrical figures, for which fantastical reasons are given, may\r\nreally involve principles of beauty or stability. But independently\r\nof this, we find, in the best works of the architects of all ages\r\n(including engineers), evidence that the true idea of mechanical\r\npressure exists among them more distinctly than among men in\r\ngeneral, although it may not be developed in a scientific form. This\r\nis true up to our own time, and the arts which such persons\r\ncultivate could not be successfully {251} exercised if it were not\r\nso. Hence the writings of architects and engineers during the middle\r\nages do really form a prelude to the works on scientific mechanics.\r\nVitruvius, in his _Architecture_, and Julius Frontinus, who, under\r\nVespasian, wrote _On Aqueducts_, of which he was superintendent,\r\nhave transmitted to us the principal part of what we know respecting\r\nthe practical mechanics and hydraulics of the Romans. In modern\r\ntimes the series is resumed. The early writers on architecture are\r\nalso writers on engineering, and often on hydrostatics: for example,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci wrote on the equilibrium of water. And thus we are\r\nled up to Stevinus of Bruges, who was engineer to Prince Maurice of\r\nNassau, and inspector of the dykes in Holland; and in whose work, on\r\nthe processes of his art, is contained the first clear modern\r\nstatement of the scientific principles of hydrostatics.\r\n\r\nHaving thus explained both the obstacles and the prospects which the\r\nmiddle ages offered to the progress of science, I now proceed to the\r\nhistory of the progress, when that progress was once again resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{253}}\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF\r\nFORMAL ASTRONOMY\r\nAFTER THE STATIONARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  .  .  .

Along with the breaking up\r\nof the ancient forms of society, were broken up the ancient energy\r\nof thinking, the clearness of idea, and steadiness of intellectual\r\naction. This mental declension produced a servile admiration for the\r\ngenius of the better periods, and thus, the spirit of Commentation:\r\nChristianity established the claim of truth to govern the world; and\r\nthis principle, misinterpreted and combined with the ignorance and\r\nservility of the times, gave rise to the Dogmatic System: and the\r\nlove of speculation, finding no secure and permitted path on solid\r\nground, went off into the regions of Mysticism.\r\n\r\nThe causes which produced the inertness and blindness of the\r\nstationary period of human knowledge, began at last to yield to the\r\ninfluence of the principles which tended to progression. The\r\nindistinctness of thought, which was the original feature in the\r\ndecline of sound knowledge, was in a measure remedied by the steady\r\ncultivation of Pure Mathematics and Astronomy, and by the progress of\r\ninventions in the Arts, which call out and fix the distinctness of our\r\nconceptions of the relations of natural phenomena. As men's minds\r\nbecame clear, they became less servile: the perception of the nature\r\nof truth drew men away from controversies about mere opinion; when\r\nthey saw distinctly the relations of _things_, they ceased to give\r\ntheir whole attention to what had been _said_ concerning them; and\r\nthus, as science rose into view, the spirit of commentation lost its\r\nway. And when men came to feel what it was to think for themselves on\r\nsubjects of science, they soon rebelled against the right of others to\r\nimpose opinions upon them. When they threw off their blind admiration\r\nfor the ancients, they were disposed to cast away also their passive\r\nobedience to the ancient system of doctrines. When they were no longer\r\ninspired by the spirit of commentation, they were no longer submissive\r\nto the dogmatism of the schools. When they began to feel that they\r\ncould {256} discover truths, they felt also a persuasion of a right\r\nand a growing will so to do.\r\n\r\nThus the revived clearness of ideas, which made its appearance at\r\nthe revival of letters, brought on a struggle with the authority,\r\nintellectual and civil, of the established schools of philosophy.\r\nThis clearness of idea showed itself, in the first instance, in\r\nAstronomy, and was embodied in the system of Copernicus; but the\r\ncontest did not come to a crisis till a century later, in the time\r\nof Galileo and other disciples of the new doctrine. It is our\r\npresent business to trace the principles of this series of events in\r\nthe history of philosophy.\r\n\r\nI do not profess to write a history of Astronomy, any further than\r\nis necessary in order to exhibit the principles on which the\r\nprogression of science proceeds; and, therefore, I neglect\r\nsubordinate persons and occurrences, in order to bring into view the\r\nleading features of great changes. Now in the introduction of the\r\nCopernican system into general acceptation, two leading views\r\noperated upon men's minds; the consideration of the system as\r\nexhibiting the apparent motions of the universe, and the\r\nconsideration of this system with reference to its causes;--the\r\n_formal_ and the _physical_ aspect of the Theory;--the relations of\r\nSpace and Time, and the relations of Force and Matter. These two\r\ndivisions of the subject were at first not clearly separated; the\r\nsecond was long mixed, in a manner very dim and obscure, with the\r\nfirst, without appearing as a distinct subject of attention; but at\r\nlast it was extricated and treated in a manner suitable to its\r\nnature. The views of Copernicus rested mainly on the formal\r\ncondition of the universe, the relations of space and time; but\r\nKepler, Galileo, and others, were led, by controversies and other\r\ncauses, to give a gradually increasing attention to the physical\r\nrelations of the heavenly bodies; an impulse was given to the study\r\nof Mechanics (the Doctrine of Motion), which became very soon an\r\nimportant and extensive science; and in no long period, the\r\ndiscoveries of Kepler, suggested by a vague but intense belief in\r\nthe physical connection of the parts of the universe, led to the\r\ndecisive and sublime generalizations of Newton.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of _formal_ and _physical_ Astronomy thus becomes\r\nnecessary, in order to treat clearly of the discussions which the\r\npropounding of the Copernican theory occasioned. But it may be\r\nobserved that, besides this great change, Astronomy made very great\r\nadvances in the same path which we have already been tracing,\r\nnamely, the determination of the quantities and laws of the\r\ncelestial motions, in so far as they were exhibited by the ancient\r\ntheories, or {257} might be represented by obvious modifications of\r\nthose theories. I speak of new Inequalities, new Phenomena, such as\r\nCopernicus, Galileo, and Tycho Brahe discovered. As, however, these\r\nwere very soon referred to the Copernican rather than the Ptolemaic\r\nhypothesis, they may be considered as developments rather of the new\r\nthan of the old Theory; and I shall, therefore, treat of them,\r\nagreeably to the plan of the former part, as the sequel of the\r\nCopernican Induction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE INDUCTIVE EPOCH OF COPERNICUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Doctrine of Copernicus, that the Sun is the true centre of the\r\ncelestial motions, depends primarily upon the consideration that\r\nsuch a supposition explains very simply and completely all the\r\nobvious appearances of the heavens. In order to see that it does\r\nthis, nothing more is requisite than a distinct conception of the\r\nnature of Relative Motion, and a knowledge of the principal\r\nAstronomical Phenomena. There was, therefore, no reason why such a\r\ndoctrine might not be _discovered_, that is, suggested as a theory\r\nplausible at first sight, long before the time of Copernicus; or\r\nrather, it was impossible that this guess, among others, should not\r\nbe propounded as a solution of the appearances of the heavens. We\r\nare not, therefore, to be surprised if we find, in the earliest\r\ntimes of Astronomy, and at various succeeding periods, such a system\r\nspoken of by astronomers, and maintained by some as true, though\r\nrejected by the majority, and by the principal writers.\r\n\r\nWhen we look back at such a difference of opinion, having in our\r\nminds, as we unavoidably have, the clear and irresistible\r\nconsiderations by which the Copernican Doctrine is established _for\r\nus_, it is difficult for us not to attribute superior sagacity and\r\ncandor to those who held that side of the question, and to imagine\r\nthose who clung to the Ptolemaic Hypothesis to have been blind and\r\nprejudiced; incapable of seeing the beauty of simplicity and\r\nsymmetry, or indisposed to resign established errors, and to accept\r\nnovel and comprehensive truths. Yet in judging thus, we are probably\r\nourselves influenced by prejudices arising from the knowledge and\r\nreceived opinions of our own times. For is it, in reality, clear\r\nthat, before the time of Copernicus, the {258} _Heliocentric_ Theory\r\n(that which places the centre of the celestial motions in the Sun)\r\nhad a claim to assent so decidedly superior to the Geocentric\r\nTheory, which places the Earth in the centre? What is the basis of\r\nthe heliocentric theory?--That the _relative_ motions are _the\r\nsame_, on that and on the other supposition. So far, therefore, the\r\ntwo hypotheses are exactly on the same footing. But, it is urged, on\r\nthe heliocentric side we have the advantage of simplicity:--true;\r\nbut we have, on the other side, the testimony of our senses; that\r\nis, the geocentric doctrine (which asserts that the Earth rests and\r\nthe heavenly bodies move) is the obvious and spontaneous\r\ninterpretation of the appearances. Both these arguments,\r\n_simplicity_ on the one side, and _obviousness_ on the other, are\r\nvague, and we may venture to say, both indecisive. We cannot\r\nestablish any strong preponderance of probability in favor of the\r\nformer doctrine, without going much further into the arguments of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nNor, when we speak of the superior _simplicity_ of the Copernican\r\ntheory, must we forget, that though this theory has undoubtedly, in\r\nthis respect, a great advantage over the Ptolemaic, yet that the\r\nCopernican system itself is very complex, when it undertakes to\r\naccount, as the Ptolemaic did, for the _Inequalities_ of the Motions\r\nof the sun, moon, and planets; and, that in the hands of Copernicus,\r\nit retained a large share of the eccentrics and epicycles of its\r\npredecessor, and, in some parts, with increased machinery. The\r\nheliocentric theory, without these appendages, would not approach\r\nthe Ptolemaic, in the accurate explanation of facts; and as those\r\nwho had placed the sun in the centre had never, till the time of\r\nCopernicus, shown how the inequalities were to be explained on that\r\nsupposition, we may assert that after the promulgation of the theory\r\nof eccentrics and epicycles on the geocentric hypothesis, there was\r\nno _published_ heliocentric theory which could bear a comparison\r\nwith that hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that all the contrivances of epicycles, and the like, by\r\nwhich the geocentric hypothesis was made to represent the phenomena,\r\nwere susceptible of an easy adaptation to a heliocentric method, _when\r\na good mathematician had once proposed to himself the problem_: and\r\nthis was precisely what Copernicus undertook and executed. But, till\r\nthe appearance of his work, the heliocentric system had never come\r\nbefore the world except as a hasty and imperfect hypothesis; which\r\nbore a favorable comparison with the phenomena, so long as their\r\ngeneral features only were known; but which had been completely thrown\r\ninto the shade by the labor and intelligence bestowed upon {259} the\r\nHipparchian or Ptolemaic theories by a long series of great\r\nastronomers of all civilized countries.\r\n\r\nBut, though the astronomers who, before Copernicus, held the\r\nheliocentric opinion, cannot, on any good grounds, be considered as\r\nmuch more enlightened than their opponents, it is curious to trace the\r\nearly and repeated manifestations of this view of the universe. The\r\ndistinct assertion of the heliocentric theory among the Greeks is an\r\nevidence of the clearness of their thoughts, and the vigour of their\r\nminds; and it is a proof of the feebleness and servility of intellect\r\nin the stationary period, that, till the period of Copernicus, no one\r\nwas found to try the fortune of this hypothesis, modified according to\r\nthe improved astronomical knowledge of the time.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient of the Greek philosophers to whom the ancients\r\nascribe the heliocentric doctrine, is Pythagoras; but Diogenes\r\nLaertius makes Philolaus, one of the followers of Pythagoras, the\r\nfirst author of this doctrine. We learn from Archimedes, that it was\r\nheld by his contemporary, Aristarchus. \"Aristarchus of Samos,\" says\r\nhe,[1\\5] \"makes this supposition,--that the fixed stars and the sun\r\nremain at rest, and that the earth revolves round the sun in a\r\ncircle.\" Plutarch[2\\5] asserts that this, which was only a\r\nhypothesis in the hands of Aristarchus, was _proved_ by Seleucus;\r\nbut we may venture to say that, at that time, no such proof was\r\npossible. Aristotle had recognized the existence of this doctrine by\r\narguing against it. \"All things,\" says he,[3\\5] \"tend to the centre\r\nof the earth, and rest there, and therefore the whole mass of the\r\nearth cannot rest except there.\" Ptolemy had in like manner argued\r\nagainst the diurnal motion of the earth: such a revolution would, he\r\nurged, disperse into surrounding space all the loose parts of the\r\nearth. Yet he allowed that such a supposition would facilitate the\r\nexplanation of some phenomena. Cicero appears to make Mercury and\r\nVenus revolve about the sun, as does Martianus Capella at a later\r\nperiod; and Seneca says[4\\5] it is a worthy subject of\r\ncontemplation, whether the earth be at rest or in motion: but at\r\nthis period, as we may see from Seneca himself, that habit of\r\nintellect which was requisite for the solution of such a question,\r\nhad been succeeded by indistinct views, and rhetorical forms of\r\nspeech. If there were any good mathematicians and good observers at\r\nthis period, they were employed in cultivating and verifying the\r\nHipparchian theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\5: Archim. _Arenarius._]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\5: _Quest. Plat._ Delamb. _A. A._ vi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\5: Quoted by Copernic. i. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\5: _Quest. Nat._ vii. 2.]\r\n\r\nNext to the Greeks, the Indians appear to have possessed that {260}\r\noriginal vigor and clearness of thought, from which true science\r\nsprings. It is remarkable that the Indians, also, had their\r\nheliocentric theorists. Aryabatta[5\\5] (A. D. 1322), and other\r\nastronomers of that country, are said to have advocated the doctrine\r\nof the earth's revolution on its axis; which opinion, however, was\r\nrejected by subsequent philosophers among the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\5: Lib. U. K. _Hist. Ast._ p. 11.]\r\n\r\nSome writers have thought that the heliocentric doctrine was\r\n_derived_ by Pythagoras and other European philosophers, from some\r\nof the oriental nations. This opinion, however, will appear to have\r\nlittle weight, if we consider that the heliocentric hypothesis, in\r\nthe only shape in which the ancients knew it, was too obvious to\r\nrequire much teaching; that it did not and could not, so far as we\r\nknow, receive any additional strength from any thing which the\r\noriental nations could teach; and that each astronomer was induced\r\nto adopt or reject it, not by any information which a master could\r\ngive him, but by his love of geometrical simplicity on the one hand,\r\nor the prejudices of sense on the other. Real science, depending on\r\na clear view of the relation of phenomena to general theoretical\r\nideas, cannot be communicated in the way of secret and exclusive\r\ntraditions, like the mysteries of certain arts and crafts. If the\r\nphilosopher do not _see_ that the theory is true, he is little the\r\nbetter for having heard or read the words which assert its truth.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, therefore, for us to assent to those views which\r\nwould discover in the heliocentric doctrines of the ancients, traces\r\nof a more profound astronomy than any which they have transmitted to\r\nus. Those doctrines were merely the plausible conjectures of men\r\nwith sound geometrical notions; but they were never extended so as\r\nto embrace the details of the existing astronomical knowledge; and\r\nperhaps we may say, that the analysis of the phenomena into the\r\narrangements of the Ptolemaic system, was so much more obvious than\r\nany other, that it must necessarily come first, in order to form an\r\nintroduction to the Copernican.\r\n\r\nThe true foundation of the heliocentric theory for the ancients was,\r\nas we have intimated, its perfect geometrical consistency with the\r\ngeneral features of the phenomena, and its simplicity. But it was\r\nunlikely that the human mind would be content to consider the\r\nsubject under this strict and limited aspect alone. In its eagerness\r\nfor wide speculative views, it naturally looked out for other and\r\nvaguer principles of connection and relation. Thus, as it had been\r\nurged in {261} favor of the geocentric doctrine, that the heaviest\r\nbody must be in the centre, it was maintained, as a leading\r\nrecommendation of the opposite opinion, that it placed the Fire, the\r\nnoblest element, in the Centre of the Universe. The authority of\r\nmythological ideas was called in on both sides to support these\r\nviews. Numa, as Plutarch[6\\5] informs us, built a circular temple\r\nover the ever-burning Fire of Vesta; typifying, not the earth, but\r\nthe Universe, which, according to the Pythagoreans, has the Fire\r\nseated at its Centre. The same writer, in another of his works,\r\nmakes one of his interlocutors say, \"Only, my friend, do not bring\r\nme before a court of law on a charge of impiety; as Cleanthes said,\r\nthat Aristarchus the Samian ought to be tried for impiety, because\r\nhe removed the Hearth of the Universe.\" This, however, seems to have\r\nbeen intended as a pleasantry.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\5: _De Facie in Orbe Lunæ_, 6.]\r\n\r\nThe prevalent physical views, and the opinions concerning the causes\r\nof the motions of the parts of the universe, were scarcely more\r\ndefinite than the ancient opinions concerning the relations of the\r\nfour elements, till Galileo had founded the true Doctrine of Motion.\r\nThough, therefore, arguments on this part of the subject were the\r\nmost important part of the controversy after Copernicus, the force\r\nof such arguments was at his time almost balanced. Even if more had\r\nbeen known on such subjects, the arguments would not have been\r\nconclusive: for instance, the vast mass of the heavens, which is\r\ncommonly urged as a reason why the heavens do not move round the\r\nearth, would not make such a motion impossible; and, on the other\r\nhand, the motions of bodies at the earth's surface, which were\r\nalleged as inconsistent with its motion, did not really disprove\r\nsuch an opinion. But according to the state of the science of motion\r\nbefore Copernicus, all reasonings from such principles were utterly\r\nvague and obscure.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention a modern who preceded Copernicus, in the\r\nassertion at least of the heliocentric doctrine. This was Nicholas\r\nof Cusa (a village near Treves), a cardinal and bishop, who, in the\r\nfirst half of the fifteenth century, was very eminent as a divine\r\nand mathematician; and who in a work, _De Doctâ Ignorantiâ_,\r\npropounded the doctrine of the motion of the earth; more, however,\r\nas a paradox than as a reality. We cannot consider this as any\r\ndistinct anticipation of a profound and consistent view of the truth.\r\n\r\nWe shall now examine further the promulgation of the Heliocentric\r\nSystem by Copernicus, and its consequences. {262}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nINDUCTION OF COPERNICUS.--THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY ASSERTED ON FORMAL\r\nGROUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT will be recollected that the _formal_ are opposed to the\r\n_physical_ grounds of a theory; the former term indicating that it\r\ngives a satisfactory account of the relations of the phenomena in\r\nSpace and Time, that is, of the Motions themselves; while the latter\r\nexpression implies further that we include in our explanation the\r\nCauses of the motions, the laws of Force and Matter. The strongest\r\nof the considerations by which Copernicus was led to invent and\r\nadopt his system of the universe were of the former kind. He was\r\ndissatisfied, he says, in his Preface addressed to the Pope, with\r\nthe want of symmetry in the Eccentric Theory, as it prevailed in his\r\ndays; and weary of the uncertainty of the mathematical traditions.\r\nHe then sought through all the works of philosophers, whether any\r\nhad held opinions concerning the motions of the world, different\r\nfrom those received in the established mathematical schools. He\r\nfound, in ancient authors, accounts of Philolaus and others, who had\r\nasserted the motion of the earth. \"Then,\" he adds, \"I, too, began to\r\nmeditate concerning the motion of the earth; and though it appeared\r\nan absurd opinion, yet since I knew that, in previous times, others\r\nhad been allowed the privilege of feigning what circles they chose,\r\nin order to explain the phenomena, I conceived that I also might\r\ntake the liberty of trying whether, on the supposition of the\r\nearth's motion, it was possible to find better explanations than the\r\nancient ones, of the revolutions of the celestial orbs.\r\n\r\n\"Having then assumed the motions of the earth, which are hereafter\r\nexplained, by laborious and long observation I at length found, that\r\nif the motions of the other planets be compared with the revolution of\r\nthe earth, not only their phenomena follow from the suppositions, but\r\nalso that the several orbs, and the whole system, are so connected in\r\norder and magnitude, that no one part can be transposed without\r\ndisturbing the rest, and introducing confusion into the whole\r\nuniverse.\"\r\n\r\nThus the satisfactory explanation of the apparent motions of the\r\nplanets, and the simplicity and symmetry of the system, were the\r\n{263} grounds on which Copernicus adopted his theory; as the craving\r\nfor these qualities was the feeling which led him to seek for a new\r\ntheory. It is manifest that in this, as in other cases of discovery,\r\na clear and steady possession of abstract Ideas, and an aptitude in\r\ncomprehending real Facts under these general conceptions, must have\r\nbeen leading characters in the discoverer's mind. He must have had a\r\ngood geometrical head, and great astronomical knowledge. He must\r\nhave seen, with peculiar distinctness, the consequences which flowed\r\nfrom his suppositions as to the relations of space and time,--the\r\napparent motions which resulted from the assumed real ones; and he\r\nmust also have known well all the irregularities of the apparent\r\nmotions for which he had to account. We find indications of these\r\nqualities in his expressions. A steady and calm contemplation of the\r\ntheory is what he asks for, as the main requisite to its reception.\r\nIf you suppose the earth to revolve and the heaven to be at rest,\r\nyou will find, he says, \"_si serio animadvertas_,\" if you think\r\nsteadily, that the apparent diurnal motion will follow. And after\r\nalleging his reasons for his system, he says,[7\\5] \"We are,\r\ntherefore, not ashamed to confess, that the whole of the space\r\nwithin the orbit of the moon, along with the centre of the earth,\r\nmoves round the sun in a year among the other planets; the magnitude\r\nof the world being so great, that the distance of the earth from the\r\nsun has no apparent magnitude when compared with the sphere of the\r\nfixed stars.\" \"All which things, though they be difficult and almost\r\ninconceivable, and against the opinion of the majority, yet, in the\r\nsequel, by God's favor, we will make clearer than the sun, at least\r\nto those who are not ignorant of mathematics.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\5: Nicolai Copernici Torinensis _de Revolutionibus Orbium\r\nCœlestium Libri VI_. Norimbergæ, M.D.XLIII. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood, that since the ancient geocentric\r\nhypothesis ascribed to the planets those motions which were apparent\r\nonly, and which really arose from the motion of the earth round the\r\nsun in the new hypothesis, the latter scheme must much simplify the\r\nplanetary theory. Kepler[8\\5] enumerates eleven motions of the\r\nPtolemaic system, which are at once exterminated and rendered\r\nunnecessary by the new system. Still, as the real motions, both of\r\nthe earth and the planets, are unequable, it was requisite to have\r\nsome mode of representing their inequalities; and, accordingly, the\r\nancient theory of eccentrics and epicycles was retained, so far as\r\nwas requisite for this purpose. The planets revolved round the sun\r\nby means of a Deferent, and a {264} great and small Epicycle; or\r\nelse by means of an Eccentric and Epicycle, modified from Ptolemy's,\r\nfor reasons which we shall shortly mention. This mode of\r\nrepresenting the motions of the planets continued in use, until it\r\nwas expelled by the discoveries of Kepler.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\5: _Myst. Cosm._ cap. 1.]\r\n\r\nBesides the daily rotation of the earth on its axis, and its annual\r\ncircuit about the sun, Copernicus attributed to the axis a \"motion\r\nof declination,\" by which, during the whole annual revolution, the\r\npole was constantly directed towards the same part of the heavens.\r\nThis constancy in the absolute direction of the axis, or its moving\r\nparallel to itself, may be more correctly viewed as not indicating\r\nany separate motion. The axis continues in the same direction,\r\nbecause there is nothing to make it change its direction; just as a\r\nstraw, lying on the surface of a cup of water, continues to point\r\nnearly in the same direction when the cup is carried round a room.\r\nAnd this was noticed by Copernicus's adherent, Rothman,[9\\5] a few\r\nyears after the publication of the work _De Revolutionibus_. \"There\r\nis no occasion,\" he says, in a letter to Tycho Brahe, \"for the\r\ntriple motion of the earth: the annual and diurnal motions suffice.\"\r\nThis error of Copernicus, if it be looked upon as an error, arose\r\nfrom his referring the position of the axis to a limited space,\r\nwhich he conceived to be carried round the sun along with the earth,\r\ninstead of referring it to fixed or absolute space. When, in a\r\nPlanetarium (a machine in which the motions of the planets are\r\nimitated), the earth is carried round the sun by being fastened to a\r\nmaterial radius, it is requisite to give a motion to the axis by\r\n_additional_ machinery, in order to enable it to _preserve_ its\r\nparallelism. A similar confusion of geometrical conception, produced\r\nby a double reference to absolute space and to the centre of\r\nrevolution, often leads persons to dispute whether the moon, which\r\nrevolves about the earth, always turning to it the same face,\r\nrevolves about her axis or not.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\5: Tycho. Epist. i. p. 184, A. D. 1590.]\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noticed that the precession of the equinoxes made\r\nit necessary to suppose the axis of the earth to be not _exactly_\r\nparallel to itself, but to deviate from that position by a slight\r\nannual difference. Copernicus erroneously supposes the precession to\r\nbe unequable; and his method of explaining this change, which is\r\nsimpler than that of the ancients, becomes more simple still, when\r\napplied to the true state of the facts.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of our speculative nature, which carry us onwards in\r\n{265} pursuit of symmetry and rule, and which thus produced the\r\ntheory of Copernicus, as they produce all theories, perpetually show\r\ntheir vigor by overshooting their mark. They obtain something by\r\naiming at much more. They detect the order and connection which\r\nexist, by imagining relations of order and connection which have no\r\nexistence. Real discoveries are thus mixed with baseless\r\nassumptions; profound sagacity is combined with fanciful conjecture;\r\nnot rarely, or in peculiar instances, but commonly, and in most\r\ncases; probably in all, if we could read the thoughts of the\r\ndiscoverers as we read the books of Kepler. To try wrong guesses is\r\napparently the only way to hit upon right ones. The character of the\r\ntrue philosopher is, not that he never conjectures hazardously, but\r\nthat his conjectures are clearly conceived and brought into rigid\r\ncontact with facts. He sees and compares distinctly the ideas and\r\nthe things,--the relations of his notions to each other and to\r\nphenomena. Under these conditions it is not only excusable, but\r\nnecessary for him, to snatch at every semblance of general rule;--to\r\ntry all promising forms of simplicity and symmetry.\r\n\r\nCopernicus is not exempt from giving us, in his work, an example of\r\nthis character of the inventive spirit. The axiom that the celestial\r\nmotions must be _circular_ and _uniform_, appeared to him to have\r\nstrong claims to acceptation; and his theory of the inequalities of\r\nthe planetary motions is fashioned upon it. His great desire was to\r\napply it more rigidly than Ptolemy had done. The time did not come\r\nfor rejecting this axiom, till the observations of Tycho Brahe and\r\nthe calculations of Kepler had been made.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to explain, in detail, Copernicus's system of\r\nthe planetary inequalities. He retained epicycles and eccentrics,\r\naltering their centres of motion; that is, he retained what was\r\n_true_ in the old system, _translating_ it into his own. The\r\npeculiarities of his method consisted in making such a combination\r\nof epicycles as to supply the place of the _equant_,[10\\5] and to\r\nmake all the motions equable about the centres of motion. This\r\ndevice was admired for a time, till Kepler's elliptic theory\r\nexpelled it, with all other forms of the theory of epicycles: but we\r\nmust observe that Copernicus was aware of some of the discrepancies\r\nwhich belonged to that theory as it had, up to that time, been\r\npropounded. In the case of Mercury's orbit, which is more eccentric\r\nthan that of the other planets, he makes suppositions which are\r\ncomplex indeed, but which show his perception of the imperfection of\r\n{266} the common theory; and he proposes a new theory of the moon,\r\nfor the very reason which did at last overturn the doctrine of\r\nepicycles, namely, that the ratio of their distances from the earth\r\nat different times was inconsistent with the circular\r\nhypothesis.[11\\5]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\5: See B. iii. Chap. **iv. Sect. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\5: _De Rev._ iv. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that, along with his mathematical clearness of view,\r\nand his astronomical knowledge, Copernicus must have had great\r\nintellectual boldness and vigor, to conceive and fully develop a\r\ntheory so different as his was from all received doctrines. His pupil\r\nand expositor, Rheticus, says to Schener, \"I beg you to have this\r\nopinion concerning that learned man, my Preceptor; that he was an\r\nardent admirer and follower of Ptolemy; but when he was compelled by\r\nphenomena and demonstration, he thought he did well to aim at the same\r\nmark at which Ptolemy had aimed, though with a bow and shafts of a\r\nvery different material from his. We must recollect what Ptolemy says,\r\nΔεῖ δ' ἐλευθέρον εἶναι τῇ γνώμῃ τὸν μέλλοντα φιλοσοφεῖν. 'He who is to\r\nfollow philosophy must be a freeman in mind.'\" Rheticus then goes on\r\nto defend his master from the charge of disrespect to the ancients:\r\n\"That temper,\" he says, \"is alien from the disposition of every good\r\nman, and most especially from the spirit of philosophy, and from no\r\none more utterly than from my Preceptor. He was very far from rashly\r\nrejecting the opinions of ancient philosophers, except for weighty\r\nreasons and irresistible facts, through any love of novelty. His\r\nyears, his gravity of character, his excellent learning, his\r\nmagnanimity and nobleness of spirit, are very far from having any\r\nliability to such a temper, which belongs either to youth, or to\r\nardent and light minds, or to those τῶν μέγα φρονούντων ἐπὶ θεωρίᾳ\r\nμικρῂ, 'who think much of themselves and know little,' as Aristotle\r\nsays.\" Undoubtedly this deference for the great men of the past,\r\njoined with the talent of seizing the spirit of their methods when the\r\nletter of their theories is no longer tenable, _is_ the true mental\r\nconstitution of discoverers.\r\n\r\nBesides the intellectual energy which was requisite in order to\r\nconstruct a system of doctrines so novel as those of Copernicus, some\r\ncourage was necessary to the publication of such opinions; certain, as\r\nthey were, to be met, to a great extent, by rejection and dispute, and\r\nperhaps by charges of heresy and mischievous tendency. This last\r\ndanger, however, must not be judged so great as we might infer from\r\nthe angry controversies and acts of authority which occurred in {267}\r\nGalileo's time. The Dogmatism of the stationary period, which\r\nidentified the cause of philosophical and religious truth, had not yet\r\ndistinctly felt itself attacked by the advance of physical knowledge;\r\nand therefore had not begun to look with alarm on such movements.\r\nStill, the claims of Scripture and of ecclesiastical authority were\r\nasserted as paramount on all subjects; and it was obvious that many\r\npersons would be disquieted or offended with the new interpretation of\r\nmany scriptural expressions, which the true theory would make\r\nnecessary. This evil Copernicus appears to have foreseen; and this and\r\nother causes long withheld him from publication. He was himself an\r\necclesiastic; and, by the patronage of his maternal uncle, was\r\nprebendary of the church of St. John at Thorn, and a canon of the\r\nchurch of Frauenburg, in the diocese of Ermeland.[12\\5] He had been a\r\nstudent at Bologna, and had taught mathematics at Rome in the year\r\n1500; and he afterwards pursued his studies and observations at his\r\nresidence near the mouth of the Vistula.[13\\5] His discovery of his\r\nsystem must have occurred before 1507, for in 1543 he informs Pope\r\nPaulus the Third, in his dedication, that he had kept his book by him\r\nfor four times the nine years recommended by Horace, and then only\r\npublished it at the earnest entreaty of his friend Cardinal Schomberg,\r\nwhose letter is prefixed to the work. \"Though I know,\" he says, \"that\r\nthe thoughts of a philosopher do not depend on the judgment of the\r\nmany, his study being to seek out truth in all things as far as that\r\nis permitted by God to human reason: yet when I considered,\" he adds,\r\n\"how absurd my doctrine would appear, I long hesitated whether I\r\nshould publish my book, or whether it were not better to follow the\r\nexample of the Pythagoreans and others, who delivered their doctrines\r\nonly by tradition and to friends.\" It will be observed that he speaks\r\nhere of the opposition of the established school of Astronomers, not\r\nof Divines. The latter, indeed, he appears to consider as a less\r\nformidable danger. \"If perchance,\" he says at the end of his preface,\r\n\"there be ματαιολόγοι, vain babblers, who knowing nothing of\r\nmathematics, yet assume the right of judging on account of some place\r\nof Scripture perversely wrested to their purpose, and who blame and\r\nattack my undertaking; I heed them not, and look upon their judgments\r\nas rash and contemptible.\" He then goes on to show that the globular\r\nfigure of the earth (which was, of course, at that time, an undisputed\r\npoint among astronomers), had been opposed on similar grounds by\r\nLactantius, who, {268} though a writer of credit in other respects,\r\nhad spoken very childishly in that matter. In another epistle prefixed\r\nto the work (by Andreas Osiander), the reader is reminded that the\r\nhypotheses of astronomers are not necessarily asserted to be true, by\r\nthose who propose them, but only to be a way of _representing_ facts.\r\nWe may observe that, in the time of Copernicus, when the motion of the\r\nearth had not been connected with the physical laws of matter and\r\nmotion, it could not be considered so distinctly real as it\r\nnecessarily was held to be in after times.\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\5: Rheticus, _Nar._ p. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\5: Riccioli.]\r\n\r\nThe delay of the publication of Copernicus's work brought it to the\r\nend of his life; he died in the year 1543, in which it was\r\npublished. It was entitled _De Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium Libri\r\nVI_. He received the only copy he ever saw on the day of his death,\r\nand never opened it: he had then, says Gassendi, his biographer,\r\nother cares. His system was, however, to a certain extent,\r\npromulgated, and his fame diffused before that time. Cardinal\r\nSchomberg, in his letter of 1536, which has been already mentioned,\r\nsays, \"Some years ago, when I heard tidings of your merit by the\r\nconstant report of all persons, my affection for you was augmented,\r\nand I congratulated the men of our time, among whom you flourish in\r\nso much honor. For I had understood that you were not only\r\nacquainted with the discoveries of ancient mathematicians, but also\r\nhad formed a new system of the world, in which you teach that the\r\nEarth moves, the Sun occupies the lowest, and consequently, the\r\nmiddle place, the sphere of the fixed stars remains immovable and\r\nfixed, and the Moon, along with the elements included in her sphere,\r\nplaced between the orbits (_cœlum_) of Mars and Venus, travels round\r\nthe sun in a yearly revolution.\"[14\\5] The writer goes on to say\r\nthat he has heard that Copernicus has written a book\r\n(_Commentarios_), in which this system is applied to the\r\nconstruction of Tables of the Planetary Motions (_erraticarum\r\nstellarum_). He then proceeds to entreat him earnestly to publish\r\nhis lucubrations. {269}\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\5: This passage has so important a place in the history, that\r\nI will give it in the original:--\"Intellexeram te non modo veterum\r\nmathematicorum inventa egregie callere sed etiam novam mundi rationem\r\nconstituisse: Qua doceas terram moveri: solem imum mundi, atque medium\r\nlocum obtinere: cœlum octavum immotum atque fixum perpetuo manere:\r\nLunam se una cum inclusis suæ spheræ elementis, inter Martis et\r\nVeneris cœlum sitam, anniversario cursu circum solem convertere. Atque\r\nde hac tota astronomiæ ratione commentarios a te confectos esse, ac\r\nerraticarum stellarum motus calculis subductos tabulis te contulisse,\r\nmaxima omnium cum admiratione. Quamobrem vir doctissime, nisi tibi\r\nmolestus sum, te etiam atque etiam oro vehementer ut hoc tuum inventum\r\nstudiosis communices, et tuas de mundi sphæra lucubrationes, una cum\r\nTabulis et si quid habes præterea quod ad eandem rem pertineat primo\r\nquoque tempore ad me mittas.\"]\r\n\r\nThis letter is dated 1536, and implies that the work of Copernicus\r\nwas then written, and known to persons who studied astronomy.\r\nDelambre says that Achilles Gassarus of Lindau, in a letter dated\r\n1540, sends to his friend George Vogelin of Constance, the book _De\r\nRevolutionibus_. But Mr. De Morgan[15\\5] has pointed out that the\r\nprinted work which Gassarus sent to Vogelin was the _Narratio_ by\r\nRheticus of Feldkirch, a eulogium of Copernicus and his system\r\nprefixed to the second edition of the _De Revolutionibus_, which\r\nappeared in 1566. In this Narration, Rheticus speaks of the work of\r\nCopernicus as a Palingenesia, or New Birth of astronomy. Rheticus,\r\nit appears, had gone to Copernicus for the purpose of getting\r\nknowledge about triangles and trigonometrical tables, and had had\r\nhis attention called to the heliocentric theory, of which he became\r\nan ardent admirer. He speaks of his \"Preceptor\" with strong\r\nadmiration, as we have seen. \"He appears to me,\" says he, \"more to\r\nresemble Ptolemy than any other astronomers.\" This, it must be\r\nrecollected, was selecting the highest known subject of comparison.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\5: _Ast. Mod._ i. p. 138. I owe this and many other\r\ncorrections to the personal kindness of Mr. De Morgan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO COPERNICUS.--THE RECEPTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE\r\nCOPERNICAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_First Reception of the Copernican Theory._\r\n\r\nTHE theories of Copernicus made their way among astronomers, in the\r\nmanner in which true astronomical theories always obtain the assent\r\nof competent judges. They led to the construction of Tables of the\r\nmotion of the sun, moon, and planets, as the theories of Hipparchus\r\nand Ptolemy had done; and the verification of the doctrines was to\r\nbe looked for, from the agreement of these Tables with observation,\r\nthrough a sufficient course of time. The work _De Revolutionibus_\r\ncontains such Tables. In 1551 Reinhold improved and republished\r\nTables founded on the principles of Copernicus. \"We owe,\" he says in\r\nhis preface, \"great obligations to Copernicus, both for his\r\nlaborious {270} observations, and for restoring the doctrine of the\r\nMotions. But though his geometry is perfect, the good old man\r\nappears to have been, at times, careless in his numerical\r\ncalculations. I have, therefore, recalculated the whole, from a\r\ncomparison of his observations with those of Ptolemy and others,\r\nfollowing nothing but the general plan of Copernicus's\r\ndemonstrations.\" These \"Prutenic Tables\" were republished in 1571\r\nand 1585, and continued in repute for some time; till superseded by\r\nthe Rudolphine Tables of Kepler in 1627. The name _Prutenic_, or\r\nPrussian, was employed by the author as a mark of gratitude to his\r\nbenefactor Albert, Markgrave of Brandenbourg. The discoveries of\r\nCopernicus had inspired neighboring nations with the ambition of\r\nclaiming a place in the literary community of Europe. In something\r\nof the same spirit, Rheticus wrote an _Encomium Borussiæ_, which was\r\npublished along with his _Narratio_.\r\n\r\nThe Tables founded upon the Copernican system were, at first, much\r\nmore generally adopted than the heliocentric doctrine on which they\r\nwere founded. Thus Magini published at Venice, in 1587, _New\r\nTheories of the Celestial Orbits, agreeing with the Observations of\r\nNicholas Copernicus_. But in the preface, after praising Copernicus,\r\nhe says, \"Since, however, he, either for the sake of showing his\r\ntalents, or induced by his own reasons, has revived the opinion of\r\nNicetas, Aristarchus, and others, concerning the motion of the\r\nearth, and has disturbed the established constitution of the world,\r\nwhich was a reason why many rejected, or received with dislike, his\r\nhypothesis, I have thought it worth while, that, rejecting the\r\nsuppositions of Copernicus, I should accommodate other causes to his\r\nobservations, and to the Prutenic Tables.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, however, was, as we have shown, received with favor\r\nby many persons, even before its general publication. The doctrine\r\nof the motion of the earth was first publicly maintained at Rome by\r\nWidmanstadt,[16\\5] who professed to have received it from\r\nCopernicus, and explained the System before the Pope and the\r\nCardinals, but did not teach it to the public.\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\5:  See Venturi, _Essai sur les Ouvrages\r\nPhysico-Mathématiques de Leonard da Vinci, avec des Fragmens tirés\r\nde ses Manuscrits apportés d'Italie_. Paris, 1797; and, as there\r\nquoted, _Marini Archiatri Pontificii_, tom. ii. p. 251.]\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, who was an eminent mathematician, as well as\r\npainter, about 1510, explained how a body, by describing a kind of\r\nspiral, might descend towards a revolving globe, so that its\r\napparent motion relative to a point in the surface of the globe,\r\nmight be in a {271} straight line leading to the centre. He thus\r\nshowed that he had entertained in his thoughts the hypothesis of the\r\nearth's rotation, and was employed in removing the difficulties\r\nwhich accompanied this supposition, by means of the consideration of\r\nthe composition of motions.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we find the question stirred by other eminent men.\r\nThus John Muller of Konigsberg, a celebrated astronomer who died in\r\n1476, better known by the name of Regiomontanus, wrote a\r\ndissertation on the subject \"Whether the earth be in motion or at\r\nrest,\" in which he decides _ex professo_[17\\5] against the motion.\r\nYet such discussions must have made generally known the arguments\r\nfor the heliocentric theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\5: Schoneri _Opera_, part ii. p. 129.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the enthusiasm with which Rheticus, who was\r\nCopernicus's pupil in the latter years of his life, speaks of him.\r\n\"Thus,\" says he, \"God has given to my excellent preceptor a reign\r\nwithout end; which may He vouchsafe to guide, govern, and increase,\r\nto the restoration of astronomical truth. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nOf the immediate converts of the Copernican system, who adopted it\r\nbefore the controversy on the subject had attracted attention, I\r\nshall only add **Mæstlin, and his pupil, Kepler. **Mæstlin published\r\nin 1588 an _Epitome Astronomiæ_, in which the immobility of the\r\nearth is asserted; but in 1596 he edited Kepler's _Mysterium\r\nCosmographicum_, and the _Narratio_ of Rheticus: and in an epistle\r\nof his own, which he inserts, he defends the Copernican system by\r\nthose physical reasonings which we shall shortly have to mention, as\r\nthe usual arguments in this dispute. Kepler himself, in the outset\r\nof the work just named, says, \"When I was at Tübingen, attending to\r\nMichael Mæstlin, being disturbed by the manifold inconveniences of\r\nthe usual opinion concerning the world, I was so delighted with\r\nCopernicus, of whom he made great mention in his lectures, that I\r\nnot only defended his opinions in our disputations of the candidates,\r\nbut wrote a thesis concerning the First Motion which is produced by\r\nthe revolution of the earth.\" This must have been in 1590.\r\n\r\nThe differences of opinion respecting the Copernican system, of which\r\nwe thus see traces, led to a controversy of some length and extent.\r\nThis controversy turned principally upon physical considerations,\r\nwhich were much more distinctly dealt with by Kepler, and others of\r\nthe followers of Copernicus, than they had been by the {272}\r\ndiscoverer himself. I shall, therefore, give a separate consideration\r\nto this part of the subject. It may be proper, however, in the first\r\nplace, to make a few observations on the progress of the doctrine,\r\nindependently of these physical speculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Diffusion of the Copernican Theory._\r\n\r\nTHE diffusion of the Copernican opinions in the world did not take\r\nplace rapidly at first. Indeed, it was necessarily some time before\r\nthe progress of observation and of theoretical mechanics gave the\r\nheliocentric doctrine that superiority in argument, which now makes us\r\nwonder that men should have hesitated when it was presented to them.\r\nYet there were some speculators of this kind, who were attracted at\r\nonce by the enlarged views of the universe which it opened to them.\r\nAmong these was the unfortunate Giordano Bruno of Nola, who was burnt\r\nas a heretic at Rome in 1600. The heresies which led to his unhappy\r\nfate were, however, not his astronomical opinions, but a work which he\r\npublished in England, and dedicated to Sir Philip Sydney, under the\r\ntitle of _Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante_, and which is understood to\r\ncontain a bitter satire of religion and the papal government. Montucla\r\nconceives that, by his rashness in visiting Italy after putting forth\r\nsuch a work, he compelled the government to act against him. Bruno\r\nembraced the Copernican opinions at an early period, and connected\r\nwith them the belief in innumerable worlds besides that which we\r\ninhabit; as also certain metaphysical or theological doctrines which\r\nhe called the Nolan philosophy. In 1591 he published _De\r\ninnumerabilibus, immenso, et infigurabili, seu de Universo et Mundis_,\r\nin which he maintains that each star is a sun, about which revolve\r\nplanets like our earth; but this opinion is mixed up with a large mass\r\nof baseless verbal speculations.\r\n\r\nGiordano Bruno is a disciple of Copernicus on whom we may look with\r\npeculiar interest, since he probably had a considerable share in\r\nintroducing the new opinions into England;[18\\5] although other\r\npersons, as Recorde, Field, Dee, had adopted it nearly thirty years\r\nearlier; and Thomas Digges ten years before, much more expressly.\r\nBruno visited this country in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and\r\nspeaks of her and of her councillors in terms of praise, which\r\nappear to show that {273} his book was intended for English readers;\r\nthough he describes the mob which was usually to be met with in the\r\nstreets of London with expressions of great disgust: \"Una plebe la\r\nquale in essere irrespettevole, incivile, rozza, rustica, selvatica,\r\net male allevata, non cede ad altra che pascer possa la terra nel\r\nsuo seno.\"[19\\5] The work to which I refer is _La Cena de le\r\nCenere_, and narrates what took place at a supper held on the\r\nevening of Ash Wednesday (about 1583, see p. 145 of the book), at\r\nthe house of Sir Fulk Greville, in order to give \"Il Nolano\" an\r\nopportunity of defending his peculiar opinions. His principal\r\nantagonists are two \"Dottori d' Oxonia,\" whom Bruno calls Nundinio\r\nand Torquato. The subject is not treated in any very masterly manner\r\non either side; but the author makes himself have greatly the\r\nadvantage not only in argument, but in temper and courtesy: and in\r\nsupport of his representations of \"pedantesca, ostinatissima\r\nignoranza et presunzione, mista con una rustica incivilità, che\r\nfarebbe prevaricar la pazienza di Giobbe,\" in his opponents, he\r\nrefers to a public disputation which he had held at Oxford with\r\nthese doctors of theology, in presence of Prince Alasco, and many of\r\nthe English nobility.[20\\5]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\5: See Burton's _Anat. Mel._ Pref. \"Some prodigious tenet\r\nor paradox of the earth's motion,\" &c. \"Bruno,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\5: _Opere di Giordano Bruno_, vol. i. p. 146.]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\5: Ib. vol. i. p. 179.]\r\n\r\nAmong the evidences of the difficulties which still lay in the way\r\nof the reception of the Copernican system, we may notice Bacon, who,\r\nas is well known, never gave a full assent to it. It is to be\r\nobserved, however, that he does not reject the opinion of the\r\nearth's motion in so peremptory and dogmatical a manner as he is\r\nsometimes accused of doing: thus in the _Thema Cœli_ he says, \"The\r\nearth, then, being supposed to be at rest (for that now appears to\r\nus the _more true_ opinion).\" And in his tract _On the Cause of the\r\nTides_, he says, \"If the tide of the sea be the extreme and\r\ndiminished limit of the diurnal motion of the heavens, it will\r\nfollow that the earth is immovable; or at least that it moves with a\r\nmuch slower motion than the water.\" In the _Descriptio Globi\r\nIntellectualis_ he gives his reasons for not accepting the\r\nheliocentric theory. \"In the system of Copernicus there are many and\r\ngrave difficulties: for the threefold motion with which he encumbers\r\nthe earth is a serious inconvenience; and the separation of the sun\r\nfrom the planets, with which he has so many affections in common, is\r\nlikewise a harsh step; and the introduction of so many immovable\r\nbodies into nature, as when he makes the sun and the stars\r\nimmovable, the bodies which are peculiarly lucid and radiant; and\r\nhis making the moon adhere to the earth in a sort of epicycle; and\r\nsome {274} other things which he assumes, are proceedings which mark\r\na man who thinks nothing of introducing fictions of any kind into\r\nnature, provided his calculations turn out well.\" We have already\r\nexplained that, in attributing _three_ motions to the earth,\r\nCopernicus had presented his system encumbered with a complexity not\r\nreally belonging to it. But it will be seen shortly, that Bacon's\r\nfundamental objection to this system was his wish for a system which\r\ncould be supported by sound physical considerations; and it must be\r\nallowed, that at the period of which we are speaking, this had not\r\nyet been done in favor of the Copernican hypothesis. We may add,\r\nhowever, that it is not quite clear that Bacon was in full\r\npossession of the details of the astronomical systems which that of\r\nCopernicus was intended to supersede; and that thus he, perhaps, did\r\nnot see how much less harsh were these fictions, as he called them,\r\nthan those which were the inevitable alternatives. Perhaps he might\r\neven be liable to a little of that indistinctness, with respect to\r\nstrictly geometrical conceptions, which we have remarked in\r\nAristotle. We can hardly otherwise account for his not seeing any\r\nuse in resolving the apparently irregular motion of a planet into\r\nseparate regular motions. Yet he speaks slightingly of this\r\nimportant step.[21\\5] \"The motion of planets, which is constantly\r\ntalked of as the motion of regression, or renitency, from west to\r\neast, and which is ascribed to the planets as a proper motion, is\r\nnot true; but only arises from appearance, from the greater advance\r\nof the starry heavens towards the west, by which the planets are\r\nleft behind to the east.\" Undoubtedly those who spoke of such a\r\nmotion of _regression_ were aware of this; but they saw how the\r\nmotion was simplified by this way of conceiving it, which Bacon\r\nseems not to have seen. Though, therefore, we may admire Bacon for\r\nthe steadfastness with which he looked forward to physical astronomy\r\nas the great and proper object of philosophical interest, we cannot\r\ngive him credit for seeing the full value and meaning of what had\r\nbeen done, up to his time, in Formal Astronomy.\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\5: _Thema Cœli_, p. 246.]\r\n\r\nBacon's contemporary, Gilbert, whom he frequently praises as a\r\nphilosopher, was much more disposed to adopt the Copernican\r\nopinions, though even he does not appear to have made up his mind to\r\nassent to the whole of the system. In his work. _De Magnete_\r\n(printed 1600), he gives the principal arguments in favor of the\r\nCopernican system, and decides that the earth revolves on its\r\naxis.[22\\5] He connects {275} this opinion with his magnetic\r\ndoctrines; and especially endeavors by that means to account for the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes. But he does not seem to have been\r\nequally confident of its annual motion. In a posthumous work,\r\npublished in 1661 (_De Mundo Nostra Sublunari Philosophia Nova_) he\r\nappears to hesitate between the systems of Tycho and\r\nCopernicus.[23\\5] Indeed, it is probable that at this period many\r\npersons were in a state of doubt on such subjects. Milton, at a\r\nperiod somewhat later, appears to have been still undecided. In the\r\nopening of the eighth book of the _Paradise Lost_, he makes Adam\r\nstate the difficulties of the Ptolemaic hypothesis, to which the\r\narchangel Raphael opposes the usual answers; but afterwards suggests\r\nto his pupil the newer system:\r\n  . . . . What if seventh to these\r\n  The planet earth, so steadfast though she seem,\r\n  Insensibly three different motions move?\r\n          _Par. Lost_, b. viii.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\5: Lib. vi. cap. 3, 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\5: Lib. ii. cap. 20.]\r\n\r\nMilton's leaning, however, seems to have been for the new system; we\r\ncan hardly believe that he would otherwise have conceived so\r\ndistinctly, and described with such obvious pleasure, the motion of\r\nthe earth:\r\n  Or she from west her silent course advance\r\n  With inoffensive pace, that spinning sleeps\r\n  On her soft axle, while she paces even,\r\n  And bears thee soft with the smooth air along.\r\n          _Par. Lost_, b. viii.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the works of the celebrated Bishop Wilkins tended more than\r\nany others to the diffusion of the Copernican system in England,\r\nsince even their extravagances drew a stronger attention to them. In\r\n1638, when he was only twenty-four years old, he published a book\r\nentitled _The Discovery of a New World; or a Discourse tending to\r\nprove that it is probable there may be another habitable World in\r\nthe Moon; with a Discourse concerning_ the possibility of a passage\r\nthither. The latter part of his subject was, of course, an obvious\r\nmark for the sneers and witticisms of critics. Two years afterwards,\r\nin 1640, appeared his _Discourse concerning a new Planet; tending to\r\nprove that it is probable our Earth is one of the Planets_: in which\r\nhe urged the reasons in favor of the heliocentric system; and\r\nexplained away the opposite arguments, especially those drawn from\r\nthe {276} supposed declarations of Scripture. Probably a good deal\r\nwas done for the establishment of those opinions by Thomas\r\nSalusbury, who was a warm admirer of Galileo, and published, in\r\n1661, a translation of several of his works bearing upon this\r\nsubject. The mathematicians of this country, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, as Napier and Briggs, Horrox and Crabtree, Oughtred and\r\nSeth Ward, Wallis and Wren, were probably all decided Copernicans.\r\nKepler dedicates one of his works to Napier, and Ward invented an\r\napproximate method of solving Kepler's problem, still known as \"the\r\nsimple elliptical hypothesis.\" Horrox wrote, and wrote well, in\r\ndefence of the Copernican opinion, in his _Keplerian Astronomy\r\ndefended and promoted_, composed (in Latin) probably about 1635, but\r\nnot published till 1673, the author having died at the age of\r\ntwenty-two, and his papers having been lost. But Salusbury's work\r\nwas calculated for another circle of readers. \"The book,\" he says in\r\nthe introductory address, \"being, for subject and design, intended\r\nchiefly for gentlemen, I have been as careless of using a studied\r\npedantry in my style, as careful in contriving a pleasant and\r\nbeautiful impression.\" In order, however, to judge of the advantage\r\nunder which the Copernican system now came forward, we must consider\r\nthe additional evidence for it which was brought to light by\r\nGalileo's astronomical discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_The Heliocentric Theory confirmed by Facts.--Galileo's\r\nAstronomical Discoveries._\r\n\r\nTHE long interval which elapsed between the last great discoveries\r\nmade by the ancients and the first made by the moderns, had afforded\r\nample time for the development of all the important consequences of\r\nthe ancient doctrines. But when the human mind had been thoroughly\r\nroused again into activity, this was no longer the course of events.\r\nDiscoveries crowded on each other; one wide field of speculation was\r\nonly just opened, when a richer promise tempted the laborers away into\r\nanother quarter. Hence the history of this period contains the\r\nbeginnings of many sciences, but exhibits none fully worked out into a\r\ncomplete or final form. Thus the science of Statics, soon after its\r\nrevival, was eclipsed and overlaid by that of Dynamics; and the\r\nCopernican system, considered merely with reference to the views of\r\nits author, was absorbed in the commanding interest of Physical\r\nAstronomy.\r\n\r\nStill, advances were made which had an important bearing on the {277}\r\nheliocentric theory, in other ways than by throwing light upon its\r\nphysical principles. I speak of the new views of the heavens which the\r\nTelescope gave; the visible inequalities of the moon's surface; the\r\nmoon-like phases of the planet Venus; the discovery of the Satellites\r\nof Jupiter, and of the Ring of Saturn. These discoveries excited at\r\nthe time the strongest interest; both from the novelty and beauty of\r\nthe objects they presented to the sense; from the way in which they\r\nseemed to gratify man's curiosity with regard to the remote parts of\r\nthe universe; and also from that of which we have here to speak, their\r\nbearing upon the conflict of the old and the new philosophy, the\r\nheliocentric and geocentric theories. It may be true, as Lagrange and\r\nMontucla say, that the laws which Galileo discovered in Mechanics\r\nimplied a profounder genius than the novelties he detected in the sky:\r\nbut the latter naturally attracted the greater share of the attention\r\nof the world, and were matter of keener discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is not to our purpose to speak here of the details and of the\r\noccasion of the invention of the Telescope; it is well known that\r\nGalileo constructed his about 1609, and proceeded immediately to apply\r\nit to the heavens. The discovery of the Satellites of Jupiter was\r\nalmost immediately the reward of his activity; and these were\r\nannounced in his _Nuncius Sidereus_, published at Venice in 1610. The\r\ntitle of this work will best convey an idea of the claim it made to\r\npublic notice: \"The _Sidereal Messenger_, announcing great and very\r\nwonderful spectacles, and offering them to the consideration of every\r\none, but especially of philosophers and astronomers; which have been\r\nobserved by _Galileo Galilei_, &c. &c., by the assistance of a\r\nperspective glass lately invented by him; namely, in the face of the\r\nmoon, in innumerable fixed stars in the milky-way, in nebulous stars,\r\nbut especially in four planets which revolve round Jupiter at\r\ndifferent intervals and periods with a wonderful celerity; which,\r\nhitherto not known to any one, the author has recently been the first\r\nto detect, and has decreed to call the _Medicean stars_.\"\r\n\r\nThe interest this discovery excited was intense: and men were at this\r\nperiod so little habituated to accommodate their convictions on\r\nmatters of science to newly observed facts, that several of the\r\n\"paper-philosophers,\" as Galileo termed them, appear to have thought\r\nthey could get rid of these new objects by writing books against them.\r\nThe effect which the discovery had upon the reception of the\r\nCopernican system was immediately very considerable. It showed that\r\nthe real universe was very different from that which ancient\r\nphilosophers had imagined, {278} and suggested at once the thought\r\nthat it contained mechanism more various and more vast than had yet\r\nbeen conjectured. And when the system of the planet Jupiter thus\r\noffered to the bodily eye a model or image of the solar system\r\naccording to the views of Copernicus, it supported the belief of such\r\nan arrangement of the planets, by an analogy all but irresistible. It\r\nthus, as a writer[24\\5] of our own times has said, \"gave the _holding\r\nturn_ to the opinions of mankind respecting the Copernican system.\" We\r\nmay trace this effect in Bacon, even though he does not assent to the\r\nmotion of the earth. \"We affirm,\" he says,[25\\5] \"the _sun-following\r\narrangement_ (solisequium) of Venus and Mercury; since it has been\r\nfound by Galileo that Jupiter also has attendants.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\5: Sir J. Herschel.]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\5: _Thema Cœli_, ix. p. 253.]\r\n\r\nThe _Nuncius Sidereus_ contained other discoveries which had the\r\nsame tendency in other ways. The examination of the moon showed, or\r\nat least seemed to show, that she was a solid body, with a surface\r\nextremely rugged and irregular. This, though perhaps not bearing\r\ndirectly upon the question of the heliocentric theory, was yet a\r\nblow to the Aristotelians, who had, in their philosophy, made the\r\nmoon a body of a kind altogether different from this, and had given\r\nan abundant quantity of reasons for the visible marks on her\r\nsurface, all proceeding on these preconceived views. Others of his\r\ndiscoveries produced the same effect; for instance, the new stars\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, and those extraordinary appearances\r\ncalled Nebulæ.\r\n\r\nBut before the end of the year, Galileo had new information to\r\ncommunicate, bearing more decidedly on the Copernican controversy.\r\nThis intelligence was indeed decisive with regard to the motion of\r\nVenus about the sun; for he found that that planet, in the course of\r\nher revolution, assumes the same succession of phases which the moon\r\nexhibits in the course of a month. This he expressed by a Latin\r\nverse:\r\n  Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur mater amorum:\r\n  The Queen of Love like Cynthia shapes her forms:\r\ntransposing the letters of this line in the published account,\r\naccording to the practice of the age; which thus showed the ancient\r\nlove for combining verbal puzzles with scientific discoveries, while\r\nit betrayed the newer feeling, of jealousy respecting the priority\r\nof discovery of physical facts.\r\n\r\nIt had always been a formidable objection to the Copernican theory\r\nthat this appearance of the planets had not been observed. The\r\nauthor {279} of that theory had endeavored to account for this, by\r\nsupposing that the rays of the sun passed freely through the body of\r\nthe planet; and Galileo takes occasion to praise him for not being\r\ndeterred from adopting the system which, on the whole, appeared to\r\nagree best with the phenomena, by meeting with some appearances\r\nwhich it did not enable him to explain.[26\\5] Yet while the fate of\r\nthe theory was yet undecided, this could not but be looked upon as a\r\nweak point in its defences.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\5: Drinkwater-Bethune, _Life of Galileo_, p. 35.]\r\n\r\nThe objection, in another form also, was embarrassing alike to the\r\nPtolemaic and Copernican systems. Why, it was asked, did not Venus\r\nappear four times as large when nearest to the earth, as when\r\nfurthest from it? The author of the Epistle prefixed to Copernicus's\r\nwork had taken refuge in this argument from the danger of being\r\nsupposed to believe in the reality of the system; and Bruno had\r\nattempted to answer it by saying, that luminous bodies were not\r\ngoverned by the same laws of perspective as opake ones. But a more\r\nsatisfactory answer now readily offered itself. Venus does not\r\nappear four times as large when she is four times as near, because\r\nher _bright part_ is _not_ four times as large, though her visible\r\ndiameter is; and as she is too small for us to see her shape with\r\nthe naked eye, we judge of her size only by the quantity of light.\r\n\r\nThe other great discoveries made in the heavens by means of\r\ntelescopes, as that of Saturn's ring and his satellites, the spots\r\nin the sun, and others, belong to the further progress of astronomy.\r\nBut we may here observe, that this doctrine of the motion of Mercury\r\nand Venus about the sun was further confirmed by Kepler's\r\nobservation of the transit of the former planet over the sun in\r\n1631. Our countryman Horrox was the first person who, in 1639, had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing a transit of Venus.\r\n\r\nThese events are a remarkable instance of the way in which a\r\ndiscovery in art (for at this period, the making of telescopes must\r\nbe mainly so considered) may influence the progress of science. We\r\nshall soon have to notice a still more remarkable example of the way\r\nin which two sciences (Astronomy and Mechanics) may influence and\r\npromote the progress of each other. {280}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_The Copernican System opposed on Theological Grounds._\r\n\r\nTHE doctrine of the Earth's motion round the Sun, when it was\r\nasserted and promulgated by Copernicus, soon after 1500, excited no\r\nvisible alarm among the theologians of his own time. Indeed, it was\r\nreceived with favor by the most intelligent ecclesiastics; and\r\nlectures in support of the heliocentric doctrine were delivered in\r\nthe ecclesiastical colleges. But the assertion and confirmation of\r\nthis doctrine by Galileo, about a century later, excited a storm of\r\ncontroversy, and was visited with severe condemnation. Galileo's own\r\nbehavior appears to have provoked the interference of the\r\necclesiastical authorities; but there must have been a great change\r\nin the temper of the times to make it possible for his adversaries\r\nto bring down the sentence of the Inquisition upon opinions which\r\nhad been so long current without giving any serious offence.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [It appears to me that the different degree of toleration\r\naccorded to the heliocentric theory in the time of Copernicus and of\r\nGalileo, must be ascribed in a great measure to the controversies\r\nand alarms which had in the mean time arisen out of the Reformation\r\nin religion, and which had rendered the Romish Church more jealous\r\nof innovations in received opinions than it had previously been. It\r\nappears too that the discussion of such novel doctrines was, at that\r\ntime at least, less freely tolerated in Italy than in other\r\ncountries. In 1597, Kepler writes to Galileo thus: \"Confide Galilæe\r\net progredere. Si bene conjecto, pauci de præcipuis Europæ\r\nMathematicis a nobis secedere volent; tanta vis est veritatis. Si\r\ntibi Italia minus est idonea ad publicationem et si aliqua habitures\r\nes impedimenta, forsan Germania nobis hanc libertatem\r\nconcedet.\"--Venturi, _Mem. di Galileo_, vol. i. p. 19.\r\n\r\nI would not however be understood to assert the condemnation of new\r\ndoctrines in science to be either a general or a characteristic\r\npractice of the Romish Church. Certainly the intelligent and\r\ncultivated minds of Italy, and many of the most eminent of her\r\necclesiastics among them, have always been the foremost in promoting\r\nand welcoming the progress of science: and, as I have stated, there\r\nwere found among the Italian ecclesiastics of Galileo's time many of\r\nthe earliest and most enlightened adherents of the Copernican\r\nsystem. The condemnation of the doctrine of the earth's motion, is,\r\nso far as I am aware, the only instance in which the Papal authority\r\nhas pronounced a decree upon a point of science. And the most candid\r\nof the {281} adherents of the Romish Church condemn the assumption\r\nof authority in such matters, which in this one instance, at least,\r\nwas made by the ecclesiastical tribunals. The author of the _Ages of\r\nFaith_ (book viii. p. 248) says, \"A congregation, it is to be\r\nlamented, declared the new system to be opposed to Scripture, and\r\ntherefore heretical.\" In more recent times, as I have elsewhere\r\nremarked,[27\\5] the Church of Authority and the Church of Private\r\nJudgment have each its peculiar temptations and dangers, when there\r\nappears to be a discrepance between Scripture and Philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\5: _Phil. Ind. Sci._ book x. chap. 4.]\r\n\r\nBut though we may acquit the popes and cardinals in Galileo's time\r\nof stupidity and perverseness in rejecting manifest scientific\r\ntruths, I do not see how we can acquit them of dissimulation and\r\nduplicity. Those persons appear to me to defend in a very strange\r\nmanner the conduct of the ecclesiastical authorities of that period,\r\nwho boast of the liberality with which Copernican professors were\r\nplaced by them in important offices, at the very time when the\r\nmotion of the earth had been declared by the same authorities\r\ncontrary to Scripture. Such merits cannot make us approve of their\r\nconduct in demanding from Galileo a public recantation of the system\r\nwhich they thus favored in other ways, and which they had repeatedly\r\ntold Galileo he might hold as much as he pleased. Nor can any one,\r\nreading the plain language of the Sentence passed upon Galileo, and\r\nof the Abjuration forced from him, find any value in the plea which\r\nhas been urged, that the opinion was denominated a _heresy_ only in\r\na wide, improper, and technical sense.\r\n\r\nBut if we are thus unable to excuse the conduct of Galileo's judges,\r\nI do not see how we can give our unconditional admiration to the\r\nphilosopher himself. Perhaps the conventional decorum which, as we\r\nhave seen, was required in treating of the Copernican system, may\r\nexcuse or explain the furtive mode of insinuating his doctrines\r\nwhich he often employs, and which some of his historians admire as\r\nsubtle irony, while others blame it as insincerity. But I do not see\r\nwith what propriety Galileo can be looked upon as a \"Martyr of\r\nScience.\" Undoubtedly he was very desirous of promoting what he\r\nconceived to be the cause of philosophical truth; but it would seem\r\nthat, while he was restless and eager in urging his opinions, he was\r\nalways ready to make such submissions as the spiritual tribunals\r\nrequired. He would really have acted as a martyr, if he had uttered\r\n{282} his \"E pur si muove,\" in the place of his abjuration, not\r\nafter it. But even in this case he would have been a martyr to a\r\ncause of which the merit was of a mingled scientific character; for\r\nhis own special and favorite share in the reasonings by which the\r\nCopernican system was supported, was the argument drawn from the\r\nflux and reflux of the sea, which argument is altogether false. He\r\nconsidered this as supplying a mechanical ground of belief, without\r\nwhich the mere astronomical reasons were quite insufficient; but in\r\nthis case he was deserted by the mechanical sagacity which appeared\r\nin his other speculations.]\r\n\r\nThe heliocentric doctrine had for a century been making its way into\r\nthe minds of thoughtful men, on the general ground of its simplicity\r\nand symmetry. Galileo appears to have thought that now, when these\r\noriginal recommendations of the system had been reinforced by his\r\nown discoveries and reasonings, it ought to be universally\r\nacknowledged as a truth and a reality. And when arguments against\r\nthe fixity of the sun and the motion of the earth were adduced from\r\nthe expressions of Scripture, he could not be satisfied without\r\nmaintaining his favorite opinion to be conformable to Scripture as\r\nwell as to Philosophy; and he was very eager in his attempts to\r\nobtain from authority a declaration to this effect. The\r\necclesiastical authorities were naturally averse to express\r\nthemselves in favor of a novel opinion, startling to the common\r\nmind, and contrary to the most obvious meaning of the words of the\r\nBible; and when they were compelled to pronounce, they decided\r\nagainst Galileo and his doctrines. He was accused before the\r\nInquisition in 1615; but at that period the result was that he was\r\nmerely recommended to confine himself to the mathematical reasonings\r\nupon the system, and to abstain from meddling with the Scripture.\r\nGalileo's zeal for his opinions soon led him again to bring the\r\nquestion under the notice of the Pope, and the result was a\r\ndeclaration of the Inquisition that the doctrine of the earth's\r\nmotion appeared to be contrary to the Sacred Scripture. Galileo was\r\nprohibited from defending and teaching this doctrine in any manner,\r\nand promised obedience to this injunction. But in 1632 he published\r\nhis **\"_Dialogo delli due Massimi Sistemi del Mondo, Tolemaico e\r\nCopernicano_:\" and in this he defended the heliocentric system by\r\nall the strongest arguments which its admirers used. Not only so,\r\nbut he introduced into this _Dialogue_ a character under the name of\r\nSimplicius, in whose mouth was put the defence of all the ancient\r\ndogmas, and who was represented as defeated at all points in the\r\ndiscussion; {283} and he prefixed to the _Dialogue_ a Notice, _To\r\nthe Discreet Reader_, in which, in a vein of transparent irony, he\r\nassigned his reasons for the publication. \"Some years ago,\" he says,\r\n\"a wholesome edict was promulgated at Rome, which, in order to check\r\nthe perilous scandals of the present age, imposed silence upon the\r\nPythagorean opinion of the motion of the earth. There were not\r\nwanting,\" he adds, \"persons who rashly asserted that this decree was\r\nthe result, not of a judicious inquiry, but of a passion\r\nill-informed; and complaints were heard that counsellors, utterly\r\nunacquainted with astronomical observations, ought not to be\r\nallowed, with their undue prohibitions, to clip the wings of\r\nspeculative intellects. At the hearing of rash lamentations like\r\nthese, my zeal could not keep silence.\" And he then goes on to say\r\nthat he wishes, by the publication of his _Dialogue_ to show that\r\nthe subject had been fully examined at Rome. The result of this was\r\nthat Galileo was condemned for his infraction of the injunction laid\r\nupon him in 1616; his _Dialogue_ was prohibited; he himself was\r\ncommanded to abjure on his knees the doctrine which he had taught;\r\nand this abjuration he performed.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated event must be looked upon rather as a question of\r\ndecorum than a struggle in which the interests of truth and free\r\ninquiry were deeply concerned. The general acceptance of the\r\nCopernican System was no longer a matter of doubt. Several persons\r\nin the highest positions, including the Pope himself, looked upon\r\nthe doctrine with favorable eyes; and had shown their interest in\r\nGalileo and his discoveries. They had tried to prevent his involving\r\nhimself in trouble by discussing the question on scriptural grounds.\r\nIt is probable that his knowledge of those favorable dispositions\r\ntowards himself and his opinions led him to suppose that the\r\nslightest color of professed submission to the Church in his belief,\r\nwould enable his arguments in favor of the system to pass unvisited:\r\nthe notice which I have quoted, in which the irony is quite\r\ntransparent and the sarcasm glaringly obvious, was deemed too flimsy\r\na veil for the purpose of decency, and indeed must have aggravated\r\nthe offence. But it is not to be supposed that the inquisitors\r\nbelieved Galileo's abjuration to be sincere, or even that they\r\nwished it to be so. It is stated that when Galileo had made his\r\nrenunciation of the earth's motion, he rose from his knees, and\r\nstamping on the earth with his foot, said, _E pur si muove_--\"And\r\nyet it _does_ move.\" This is sometimes represented as the heroic\r\nsoliloquy of a mind cherishing its conviction of the truth in spite\r\nof persecution; I think we may more naturally conceive it uttered as\r\na playful {284} epigram in the ear of a cardinal's secretary, with a\r\nfull knowledge that it would be immediately repeated to his master.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [Throughout the course of the proceedings against him,\r\nGalileo was treated with great courtesy and indulgence. He was\r\ncondemned to a formal imprisonment and a very light discipline. \"Te\r\ndamnamus ad formalem carcerem hujus S. Officii ad tempus arbitrio\r\nnostro limitandum; et titulo pœnitentiæ salutaris præcipimus ut\r\ntribus annis futuris recites **semel in hebdomadâ septem psalmos\r\npenitentiales.\" But this confinement was reduced to his being placed\r\nunder some slight restrictions, first at the house of Nicolini, the\r\nambassador of his own sovereign, and afterwards at the country seat\r\nof Archbishop Piccolomini, one of his own warmest friends.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been asserted or insinuated that Galileo was\r\nsubjected to bodily torture. An argument has been drawn from the\r\nexpressions used in his sentence: \"Cum vero nobis videretur non esse\r\na te integram veritatem pronunciatam circa tuam intentionem;\r\njudicavimus necesse esse venire ad rigorosum examen tui, in quo\r\nrespondisti catholicè.\" It has been argued by M. Libri (_Hist. des\r\nSciences Mathématiques en Italie_, vol. IV. p. 259), and M. Quinet\r\n(_L'Ultramontanisme_, IV. Leçon, p. 104), that the _rigorosum\r\nexamen_ necessarily implies bodily torture, notwithstanding that no\r\nsuch thing is mentioned by Galileo and his contemporaries, and\r\nnotwithstanding the consideration with which he was treated in all\r\nother respects: but M. Biot more justly remarks (_Biogr. Univ._ Art.\r\n_Galileo_), that such a procedure is incredible.\r\n\r\nTo the opinion of M. Biot, we may add that of Delambre, who rejects\r\nthe notion of Galileo's having been put to the torture, as\r\ninconsistent with the general conduct of the authorities towards\r\nhim, and as irreconcilable with the accounts of the trial given by\r\nGalileo himself, and by a servant of his, who never quitted him for\r\nan instant. He adds also, that it is inconsistent with the words of\r\nhis sentence, \"ne tuus iste gravis et perniciosus error ac\r\ntransgressio remaneat _omnino impunitus_;\" for the error would have\r\nbeen already very far from impunity, if Galileo had been previously\r\nsubjected to the rack. He adds, very reasonably, \"il ne faut noircir\r\npersonne sans preuve, pas même l'Inquisition;\"--we must not\r\ncalumniate even the Inquisition.]\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical authorities having once declared the doctrine of\r\nthe earth's motion to be contrary to Scripture and heretical, long\r\nadhered in form to this declaration, and did not allow the Copernican\r\nsystem to be taught in any other way than as an \"hypothesis.\" The\r\n{285} Padua edition of Galileo's works, published in 1744, contains\r\nthe _Dialogue_ which now, the editors say, \"Esce finalmente a pubblico\r\nlibero uso colle debite licenze,\" is now at last freely published with\r\nthe requisite license; but they add, \"quanto alla Quistione principale\r\ndel moto della terra, anche noi ci conformiamo alla ritrazione et\r\nprotesta dell' Autore, dichiarando nella piu solenne forma, che non\r\npuò, nè dee ammetersi se non come pura Ipotesi Mathematice, che serve\r\na spiegare piu agevolamento certi fenomeni;\" \"neither can nor ought to\r\nbe admitted except as a convenient hypothesis.\" And in the edition of\r\nNewton's _Principia_, published in 1760, by Le Sueur and Jacquier, of\r\nthe Order of Minims, the editors prefix to the Third Book their\r\n_Declaratio_, that though Newton assumes the hypothesis of the motion\r\nof the earth, and therefore they had used similar language, they were,\r\nin doing this, assuming a character which did not belong to them.\r\n\"Hinc alienam coacti sumus gerere personam.\" They add, \"Cæterum latis\r\na summis Pontificibus contra telluris motum Decretis, nos obsequi\r\nprofitemur.\"\r\n\r\nBy thus making decrees against a doctrine which in the course of\r\ntime was established as an indisputable scientific truth, the See of\r\nRome was guilty of an unwise and unfortunate stretch of\r\necclesiastical authority. But though we do not hesitate to pronounce\r\nsuch a judgment on this case, we may add that there is a question of\r\nno small real difficulty, which the progress of science often brings\r\ninto notice, as it did then. The Revelation on which our religion is\r\nfounded, seems to declare, or to take for granted, opinions on\r\npoints on which Science also gives her decision; and we then come to\r\nthis dilemma,--that doctrines, established by a scientific use of\r\nreason, may seem to contradict the declarations of Revelation,\r\naccording to our view of its meaning;--and yet, that we cannot, in\r\nconsistency with our religious views, make reason a judge of the\r\ntruth of revealed doctrines. In the case of Astronomy, on which\r\nGalileo was called in question, the general sense of cultivated and\r\nsober-minded men has long ago drawn that distinction between\r\nreligious and physical tenets, which is necessary to resolve this\r\ndilemma. On this point, it is reasonably held, that the phrases\r\nwhich are employed in Scripture respecting astronomical facts, are\r\nnot to be made use of to guide our scientific opinions; they may be\r\nsupposed to answer their end if they fall in with common notions,\r\nand are thus effectually subservient to the moral and religions\r\nimport of Revelation. But the establishment of this distinction was\r\nnot accomplished without long and distressing controversies. Nor, if\r\nwe wish to {286} include all cases in which the same dilemma may\r\nagain come into play is it easy to lay down an adequate canon for\r\nthe purpose. For we can hardly foresee, beforehand, what part of the\r\npast history of the universe may eventually be found to come within\r\nthe domain of science; or what bearing the tenets, which science\r\nestablishes, may have upon our view of the providential and revealed\r\ngovernment of the world. But without attempting here to generalize\r\non this subject, there are two reflections which may be worth our\r\nnotice: they are supported by what took place in reference to\r\nAstronomy on the occasion of which we are speaking; and may, at\r\nother periods, be applicable to other sciences.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the meaning which any generation puts upon the\r\nphrases of Scripture, depends, more than is at first sight supposed\r\nupon the received philosophy of the time. Hence, while men imagine\r\nthat they are contending for Revelation, they are, in fact,\r\ncontending for their own interpretation of Revelation, unconsciously\r\nadapted to what they believe to be rationally probable. And the new\r\ninterpretation, which the new philosophy requires, and which appears\r\nto the older school to be a fatal violence done to the authority of\r\nreligion, is accepted by their successors without the dangerous\r\nresults which were apprehended. When the language of Scripture,\r\ninvested with its new meaning, has become familiar to men, it is\r\nfound that the ideas which it calls up, are quite as reconcilable as\r\nthe former ones were with the soundest religious views. And the\r\nworld then looks back with surprise at the error of those who\r\nthought that the essence of Revelation was involved in their own\r\narbitrary version of some collateral circumstance. At the present\r\nday we can hardly conceive how reasonable men should have imagined\r\nthat religious reflections on the stability of the earth, and the\r\nbeauty and use of the luminaries which revolve round it, would be\r\ninterfered with by its being acknowledged that this rest and motion\r\nare apparent only.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we may observe that those who thus adhere\r\ntenaciously to the traditionary or arbitrary mode of understanding\r\nScriptural expressions of physical events, are always strongly\r\ncondemned by succeeding generations. They are looked upon with\r\ncontempt by the world at large, who cannot enter into the obsolete\r\ndifficulties with which they encumbered themselves; and with pity by\r\nthe more considerate and serious, who know how much sagacity and\r\nrightmindedness are requisite for the conduct of philosophers and\r\nreligious men on such occasions; but who know also how weak and vain\r\nis the attempt {287} to get rid of the difficulty by merely\r\ndenouncing the new tenets as inconsistent with religious belief, and\r\nby visiting the promulgators of them with severity such as the state\r\nof opinions and institutions may allow. The prosecutors of Galileo\r\nare still up to the scorn and aversion of mankind: although, as we\r\nhave seen, they did not act till it seemed that their position\r\ncompelled them to do so, and then proceeded with all the gentleness\r\nand moderation which were compatible with judicial forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_The Heliocentric Theory confirmed on Physical\r\nconsiderations.--_(_Prelude to Kepler's Astronomical Discoveries._)\r\n\r\nBY physical views, I mean, as I have already said, those which\r\ndepend on the causes of the motions of matter, as, for instance, the\r\nconsideration of the nature and laws of the force by which bodies\r\nfall downwards. Such considerations were necessarily and immediately\r\nbrought under notice by the examination of the Copernican theory;\r\nbut the loose and inaccurate notions which prevailed respecting the\r\nnature and laws of force, prevented, for some time, all distinct\r\nreasoning on this subject, and gave truth little advantage over\r\nerror. The formation of a new Science, the Science of Motion and its\r\nCauses, was requisite, before the heliocentric system could have\r\njustice done it with regard to this part of the subject.\r\n\r\nThis discussion was at first carried on, as was to be expected, in\r\nterms of the received, that is, the Aristotelian doctrines. Thus,\r\nCopernicus says that terrestrial things appear to be at rest when they\r\nhave a motion according to nature, that is, a circular motion; and\r\nascend or descend when they have, in addition to this, a rectilinear\r\nmotion by which they **endeavor to get into their own place. But his\r\ndisciples soon began to question the Aristotelian dogmas, and to seek\r\nfor sounder views by the use of their own reason. \"The great argument\r\nagainst this system,\" says Mæstlin, \"is that heavy bodies are said to\r\nmove to the centre of the universe, and light bodies from the centre.\r\nBut I would ask, where do we get this experience of heavy and light\r\nbodies? and how is our knowledge on these subjects extended so far\r\nthat we can reason with certainty concerning the centre of the whole\r\nuniverse? Is not the only residence and home of all the things which\r\nare heavy and light to us, the earth and the air which surrounds it?\r\nand what is the earth and the ambient air, with respect to the\r\nimmensity of the universe? It is a point, a punctule, or something, if\r\nthere be any thing, still less. As our light and heavy bodies tend to\r\n{288} the centre of our earth, it is credible that the sun, the moon,\r\nand the other lights, have a similar affection, by which they remain\r\nround as we see them; but none of these centres is necessarily the\r\ncentre of the universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and important physical difficulty attendant upon\r\nthe supposition of the motion of the earth was thus stated: If the\r\nearth move, how is it that a stone, dropped from the top of a high\r\ntower, falls exactly at the foot of the tower? since the tower being\r\ncarried from west to east by the diurnal revolution of the earth,\r\nthe stone must be left behind to the west of the place from which it\r\nwas let fall. The proper answer to this was, that the motion which\r\nthe falling body received from its tendency downwards was\r\n_compounded_ with the motion which, before it fell, it had in virtue\r\nof the earth's rotation: but this answer could not be clearly made\r\nor apprehended, till Galileo and his pupils had established the laws\r\nof such Compositions of motion arising from different forces.\r\nRothman, Kepler, and other defenders of the Copernican system, gave\r\ntheir reply somewhat at a venture, when they asserted that the\r\nmotion of the earth was communicated to bodies at its surface.\r\nStill, the facts which indicate and establish this truth are\r\nobvious, when the subject is steadily considered; and the\r\nCopernicans soon found that they had the superiority of argument on\r\nthis point as well as others. The attacks upon the Copernican system\r\nby Durret, Morin, Riccioli, and the defence of it by Galileo,\r\nLansberg, Gassendi,[28\\5] left on all candid reasoners a clear\r\nimpression in favour of the system. Morin attempted to stop the\r\nmotion of the earth, which he called breaking its wings; his _Alæ\r\nTerræ Fractæ_ was published in 1643, and answered by Gassendi. And\r\nRiccioli, as late as 1653, in his _Almagestum Novum_, enumerated\r\nfifty-seven Copernican arguments, and pretended to refute them all:\r\nbut such reasonings now made no converts; and by this time the\r\nmechanical objections to the motion of the earth were generally seen\r\nto be baseless, as we shall relate when we come to speak of the\r\nprogress of Mechanics as a distinct science. In the mean time, the\r\nbeauty and simplicity of the heliocentric theory were perpetually\r\nwinning the admiration even of those who, from one cause or other,\r\nrefused their assent to it. Thus Riccioli, the last of its\r\nconsiderable opponents, allows its superiority in these respects;\r\nand acknowledges (in 1653) that the Copernican belief appears rather\r\nto increase than diminish under the condemnation of the decrees of\r\nthe Cardinals. He applies to it the lines of Horace:[29\\5] {289}\r\n  Per damna per cædes, ab ipso\r\n  Sumit opes animumque ferro.\r\n  Untamed its pride, unchecked its course,\r\n  From foes and wounds it gathers force.\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\5: Del. _A. M._ vol. i. p. 594.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\5: _Almag. Nov._ p. 102.]\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the influence of the motion of the earth on the\r\nmotions of bodies at its surface; but the notion of a physical\r\nconnection among the parts of the universe was taken up by Kepler in\r\nanother point of view, which would probably have been considered as\r\nhighly fantastical, if the result had not been, that it led to by\r\nfar the most magnificent and most certain train of truths which the\r\nwhole expanse of human knowledge can show. I speak of the persuasion\r\nof the existence of numerical and geometrical laws connecting the\r\ndistances, times, and forces of the bodies which revolve about the\r\ncentral sun. That steady and intense conviction of this governing\r\nprinciple, which made its development and verification the leading\r\nemployment of Kepler's most active and busy life, cannot be\r\nconsidered otherwise than as an example of profound sagacity. That\r\nit was connected, though dimly and obscurely, with the notion of a\r\ncentral agency or influence of some sort, emanating from the sun,\r\ncannot be doubted. Kepler, in his first essay of this kind, the\r\n_Mysterium Cosmographicum_, says, \"The motion of the earth, which\r\nCopernicus had proved by _mathematical_ reasons, I wanted to prove\r\nby _physical_, or, if you prefer it, metaphysical.\" In the twentieth\r\nchapter of that work, he endeavors to make out some relation between\r\nthe distances of the Planets from the Sun and their velocities. The\r\ninveterate yet vague notions of forces which preside in this\r\nattempt, may be judged of by such passages as the following:--\"We\r\nmust suppose one of two things; either that the moving spirits, in\r\nproportion as they are more removed from the sun, are more feeble;\r\nor that there is one moving spirit in the centre of all the orbits,\r\nnamely, in the sun, which urges each body the more vehemently in\r\nproportion as it is nearer; but in more distant spaces languishes in\r\nconsequence of the remoteness and attenuation of its virtue.\"\r\n\r\nWe must not forget, in reading such passages, that they were written\r\nunder a belief that force was requisite to keep up, as well as to\r\nchange the motion of each planet; and that a body, moving in a\r\ncircle, would _stop_ when the force of the central point ceased,\r\ninstead of moving off in a tangent to the circle, as we now know it\r\nwould do. The force which Kepler supposes is a tangential force, in\r\nthe direction of the body's motion, and nearly perpendicular to the\r\nradius; the {290} force which modern philosophy has established, is\r\nin the direction of the radius, and nearly perpendicular to the\r\nbody's path. Kepler was right no further than in his suspicion of a\r\nconnection between the cause of motion and the distance from the\r\ncentre; not only was his knowledge imperfect in all particulars, but\r\nhis most general conception of the mode of action of a cause of\r\nmotion was erroneous.\r\n\r\nWith these general convictions and these physical notions in his\r\nmind, Kepler endeavored to detect numerical and geometrical\r\nrelations among the parts of the solar system. After extraordinary\r\nlabor, perseverance, and ingenuity, he was eminently successful in\r\ndiscovering such relations; but the glory and merit of interpreting\r\nthem according to their physical meaning, was reserved for his\r\ngreater successor, Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINDUCTIVE EPOCH OF KEPLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Intellectual Character of Kepler._\r\n\r\nSEVERAL persons,[30\\5] especially in recent times, who have taken a\r\nview of the discoveries of Kepler, appear to have been surprised and\r\nsomewhat discontented that conjectures, apparently so fanciful and\r\narbitrary as his, should have led to important discoveries. They\r\nseem to have been alarmed at the _Moral_ that their readers might\r\ndraw, from the tale of a Quest of Knowledge, in which the Hero,\r\nthough fantastical and self-willed, and violating in his conduct, as\r\nthey conceived, all right rule and sound philosophy, is rewarded\r\nwith the most signal triumphs. Perhaps one or two reflections may in\r\nsome measure reconcile us to this result. {291}\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\5: Laplace, _Précis de l'Hist. d'Ast._ p. 94. \"Il est\r\naffligeant pour l'esprit humain de voir ce grand homme, même dans ses\r\nderniers ouvrages, se complaire avec délices dans ses chimériques\r\nspéculations, et les regarder comme l'âme et la vie de l'astronomie.\"\r\n\r\n_Hist. of Ast._, L. U. K., p. 53. \"This success [of Kepler] may well\r\ninspire with dismay those who are accustomed to consider experiment\r\nand rigorous induction as the only means to interrogate nature with\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n_Life of Kepler_, L. U. K., p. 14, \"Bad philosophy.\" P. 15,\r\n\"Kepler's miraculous good fortune in seizing truths across the\r\nwildest and most absurd theories.\" P. 54, \"The danger of attempting\r\nto follow his method in the pursuit of truth.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we may observe that the leading thought which\r\nsuggested and animated all Kepler's attempts was true, and we may\r\nadd, sagacious and philosophical; namely, that there must be _some_\r\nnumerical or geometrical relations among the times, distances, and\r\nvelocities of the revolving bodies of the solar system. This settled\r\nand constant conviction of an important truth regulated all the\r\nconjectures, apparently so capricious and fanciful, which he made\r\nand examined, respecting particular relations in the system.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we may venture to say, that advances in knowledge\r\nare not commonly made without the previous exercise of some boldness\r\nand license in guessing. The discovery of new truths requires,\r\nundoubtedly, minds careful and scrupulous in examining what is\r\nsuggested; but it requires, no less, such as are quick and fertile\r\nin suggesting. What is Invention, except the talent of rapidly\r\ncalling before us many possibilities, and selecting the appropriate\r\none? It is true, that when we have rejected all the inadmissible\r\nsuppositions, they are quickly forgotten by most persons; and few\r\nthink it necessary to dwell on these discarded hypotheses, and on\r\nthe process by which they were condemned, as Kepler has done. But\r\nall who discover truths must have reasoned upon many errors, to\r\nobtain each truth; every accepted doctrine must have been one\r\nselected out of many candidates. In making many conjectures, which\r\non trial proved erroneous, Kepler was no more fanciful or\r\nunphilosophical than other discoverers have been. Discovery is not a\r\n\"cautious\" or \"rigorous\" process, in the sense of abstaining from\r\nsuch suppositions. But there are great differences in different\r\ncases, in the facility with which guesses are proved to be errors,\r\nand in the degree of attention with which the error and the proof\r\nare afterwards dwelt on. Kepler certainly was remarkable for the\r\nlabor which he gave to such self-refutations, and for the candor and\r\ncopiousness with which he narrated them; his works are in this way\r\nextremely curious and amusing; and are a very instructive exhibition\r\nof the mental process of discovery. But in this respect, I venture\r\nto believe, they exhibit to us the usual process (somewhat\r\ncaricatured) of inventive minds: they rather exemplify the _rule_ of\r\ngenius than (as has generally been hitherto taught) the _exception_.\r\nWe may add, that if many of Kepler's guesses now appear fanciful and\r\nabsurd, because time and observation have refuted them, others,\r\nwhich were at the time equally gratuitous, have been confirmed by\r\nsucceeding discoveries in a manner which makes them appear\r\nmarvellously sagacious; as, for instance, his assertion of the\r\nrotation of {292} the sun on his axis, before the invention of the\r\ntelescope, and his opinion that the obliquity of the ecliptic was\r\ndecreasing, but would, after a long-continued diminution, stop, and\r\nthen increase again.[31\\5] Nothing can be more just, as well as more\r\npoetically happy, than Kepler's picture of the philosopher's pursuit\r\nof scientific truth, conveyed by means of an allusion to Virgil's\r\nshepherd and shepherdess:\r\n  Malo me Galatea petit, lasciva puella\r\n  Et fugit ad salices et se cupit ante videri.\r\n  Coy yet inviting, Galatea loves\r\n  To sport in sight, then plunge into the groves;\r\n  The challenge given, she darts along the green,\r\n  Will not be caught, yet would not run unseen.\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\5: Bailly, _A. M._ iii. 175.]\r\n\r\nWe may notice as another peculiarity of Kepler's reasonings, the\r\nlength and laboriousness of the processes by which he discovered the\r\nerrors of his first guesses. One of the most important talents\r\nrequisite for a discoverer, is the ingenuity and skill which devises\r\nmeans for rapidly testing false suppositions as they offer themselves.\r\nThis talent Kepler did not possess: he was not even a good\r\narithmetical calculator, often making mistakes, some of which he\r\ndetected and laments, while others escaped him to the last. But his\r\ndefects in this respect were compensated by his courage and\r\nperseverance in undertaking and executing such tasks; and, what was\r\nstill more admirable, he never allowed the labor he had spent upon any\r\nconjecture to produce any reluctance in abandoning the hypothesis, as\r\nsoon as he had evidence of its inaccuracy. The only way in which he\r\nrewarded himself for his trouble, was by describing to the world, in\r\nhis lively manner, his schemes, exertions, and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe _mystical_ parts of Kepler's opinions, as his belief in\r\nastrology, his persuasion that the earth was an animal, and many of\r\nthe loose moral and spiritual as well as sensible analyses by which\r\nhe represented to himself the powers which he supposed to prevail in\r\nthe universe, do not appear to have interfered with his discovery,\r\nbut rather to have stimulated his invention, and animated his\r\nexertions. Indeed, where there are clear scientific ideas on one\r\nsubject in the mind, it does not appear that mysticism on others is\r\nat all unfavorable to the successful prosecution of research.\r\n\r\nI conceive, then, that we may consider Kepler's character as\r\ncontaining the general features of the character of a scientific\r\ndiscoverer, {293} though some of the features are exaggerated, and\r\nsome too feebly marked. His spirit of invention was undoubtedly very\r\nfertile and ready, and this and his perseverance served to remedy\r\nhis deficiency in mathematical artifice and method. But the peculiar\r\nphysiognomy is given to his intellectual aspect by his dwelling in a\r\nmost prominent manner on those erroneous trains of thought which\r\nother persons conceal from the world, and often themselves forget,\r\nbecause they find means of stopping them at the outset. In the\r\nbeginning of his book (_Argumenta Capitum_) he says, \"if Christopher\r\nColumbus, if Magellan, if the Portuguese, when they narrate their\r\nwanderings, are not only excused, but if we do not wish these\r\npassages omitted, and should lose much pleasure if they were, let no\r\none blame me for doing the same.\" Kepler's talents were a kindly and\r\nfertile soil, which he cultivated with abundant toil and vigor; but\r\nwith great scantiness of agricultural skill and implements. Weeds\r\nand the grain throve and flourished side by side almost\r\nundistinguished; and he gave a peculiar appearance to his harvest,\r\nby gathering and preserving the one class of plants with as much\r\ncare and diligence as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Kepler's Discovery of his Third Law._\r\n\r\nI SHALL now give some account of Kepler's speculations and\r\ndiscoveries. The first discovery which he attempted, the relation\r\namong the successive distances of the planets from the sun, was a\r\nfailure; his doctrine being without any solid foundation, although\r\npropounded by him with great triumph, in a work which he called\r\n_Mysterium Cosmographicum_, and which was published in 1596. The\r\naccount which he gives of the train of his thoughts on this subject,\r\nnamely, the various suppositions assumed, examined, and rejected, is\r\ncurious and instructive, for the reasons just stated; but we shall\r\nnot dwell upon these essays, since they led only to an opinion now\r\nentirely abandoned. The doctrine which professed to give the true\r\nrelation of the orbits of the different planets, was thus\r\ndelivered:[32\\5] \"The orbit of the earth is a circle: round the\r\nsphere to which this circle belongs, describe a dodecahedron; the\r\nsphere including this will give the orbit of Mars. Round Mars\r\ndescribe a tetrahedron; the circle including this will be the orbit\r\nof Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter's orbit; the circle\r\nincluding this will be the orbit of Saturn. Now inscribe in the\r\nEarth's orbit an icosahedron; the circle inscribed in it will be the\r\norbit of Venus. {294} Inscribe an octahedron in the orbit of Venus;\r\nthe circle inscribed in it will be Mercury's orbit. This is the\r\nreason of the number of the planets.\" The five kinds of polyhedral\r\nbodies here mentioned are the only \"Regular Solids.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\5: L. U. K. Kepler, 6.]\r\n\r\nBut though this part of the _Mysterium Cosmographicum_ was a\r\nfailure, the same researches continued to occupy Kepler's mind; and\r\ntwenty-two years later led him to one of the important rules known\r\nto us as \"Kepler's Laws;\" namely, to the rule connecting the mean\r\ndistances of the planets from the sun with the times of their\r\nrevolutions. This rule is expressed in mathematical terms, by saying\r\nthat the squares of the periodic times are in the same proportion as\r\nthe cubes of the distances; and was of great importance to Newton in\r\nleading him to the law of the sun's attractive force. We may\r\nproperly consider this discovery as the sequel of the train of\r\nthought already noticed. In the beginning of the _Mysterium_, Kepler\r\nhad said, \"In the year 1595, I brooded with the whole energy of my\r\nmind on the subject of the Copernican system. There were three\r\nthings in particular of which I pertinaciously sought the causes why\r\nthey are not other than they are; the number, the size, and the\r\nmotion of the orbits.\" We have seen the nature of his attempt to\r\naccount for the two first of these points. He had also made some\r\nessays to connect the motions of the planets with their distances,\r\nbut with his success in this respect he was not himself completely\r\nsatisfied. But in the fifth book of the _Harmonice Mundi_, published\r\nin 1619, he says, \"What I prophesied two-and-twenty years ago as\r\nsoon as I had discovered the Five Solids among the Heavenly Bodies;\r\nwhat I firmly believed before I had seen the _Harmonics_ of Ptolemy;\r\nwhat I promised my friends in the title of this book (_On the most\r\nperfect Harmony of the Celestial Motions_) which I named before I\r\nwas sure of my discovery; what sixteen years ago I regarded as a\r\nthing to be sought; that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I\r\nsettled in Prague, for which I have devoted the best part of my life\r\nto astronomical contemplations; at length I have brought to light,\r\nand have recognized its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations.\"\r\n\r\nThe rule thus referred to is stated in the third Chapter of this fifth\r\nBook. \"It is,\" he says, \"a most certain and exact thing that the\r\nproportion which exists between the periodic times of any two planets\r\nis precisely the sesquiplicate of the proportion of their mean\r\ndistances; that is, of the radii of the orbits. Thus, the period of\r\nthe earth is one year, that of Saturn thirty years; if any one trisect\r\nthe proportion, that {295} is, take the cube root of it, and double\r\nthe proportion so found, that is, square it, he will find the exact\r\nproportion of the distances of the Earth and of Saturn from the sun.\r\nFor the cube root of 1 is 1, and the square of this is 1; and the cube\r\nroot of 30 is greater than 3, and therefore the square of it is\r\ngreater than 9. And Saturn at his mean distance from the sun is at a\r\nlittle more than 9 times the mean distance of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we now look back at the time and exertions which the\r\nestablishment of this law cost Kepler, we are tempted to imagine that\r\nhe was strangely blind in not seeing it sooner. His object, we might\r\nreason, was to discover a law connecting the distances and the\r\nperiodic times. What law of connection could be more simple and\r\nobvious, we might say, than that one of these quantities should vary\r\nas some _power_ of the other, or as some _root_; or as some\r\ncombination of the two, which in a more general view, may still be\r\ncalled a _power_? And if the problem had been viewed in this way, the\r\nquestion must have occurred, to _what_ power of the periodic times are\r\nthe distances proportional? And the answer must have been, the trial\r\nbeing made, that they are proportional to the square of the cube root.\r\nThis _ex-post-facto_ obviousness of discoveries is a delusion to which\r\nwe are liable with regard to many of the most important principles. In\r\nthe case of Kepler, we may observe, that the process of connecting two\r\nclasses of quantities by comparing their _powers_, is obvious only to\r\nthose who are familiar with general algebraical views; and that in\r\nKepler's time, algebra had not taken the place of geometry, as the\r\nmost usual vehicle of mathematical reasoning. It may be added, also,\r\nthat Kepler always sought his _formal_ laws by means of _physical_\r\nreasonings; and these, though vague or erroneous, determined the\r\nnature of the mathematical connection which he assumed. Thus in the\r\n_Mysterium_ he had been led by his notions of moving virtue of the sun\r\nto this conjecture, among others--that, in the planets, the increase\r\nof the periods will be double of the difference of the distances;\r\nwhich supposition he found to give him an approach to the actual\r\nproportion of the distances, but one not sufficiently close to satisfy\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the fifth Book of the _Harmonics of the\r\nUniverse_ consists in attempts to explain various relations among\r\nthe distances, times, and eccentricities of the planets, by means of\r\nthe ratios which belong to certain concords and discords. This\r\nportion of the work is so complex and laborious, that probably few\r\nmodern readers have had courage to go through it. Delambre\r\nacknowledged that his patience {296} often failed him during the\r\ntask;[33\\5] and subscribes to the judgment of Bailly: \"After this\r\nsublime effort, Kepler replunges himself in the relations of music\r\nto the motions, the distance, and the eccentricities of the planets.\r\nIn all these harmonic ratios there is not one true relation; in a\r\ncrowd of ideas there is not one truth: he becomes a man after being\r\na spirit of light.\" Certainly these speculations are of no value,\r\nbut we may look on them with toleration, when we recollect that\r\nNewton has sought for analogies between the spaces occupied by the\r\nprismatic colors and the notes of the gamut.[34\\5] The numerical\r\nrelations of Concords are so peculiar that we can easily suppose\r\nthem to have other bearings than those which first offer themselves.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\5: _A. M._ a. 358.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\5: _Optics_, b. ii. p. iv. Obs. 5.]\r\n\r\nIt does not belong to my present purpose to speak at length of the\r\nspeculations concerning the forces producing the celestial motions\r\nby which Kepler was led to this celebrated law, or of those which he\r\ndeduced from it, and which are found in the _Epitome Astronomiæ\r\nCopernicanæ_, published in 1622. In that work also (p. 554), he\r\nextended this law, though in a loose manner, to the satellites of\r\nJupiter. These _physical_ speculations were only a vague and distant\r\nprelude to Newton's discoveries; and the law, as a _formal_ rule,\r\nwas complete in itself. We must now attend to the history of the\r\nother two laws with which Kepler's name is associated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Kepler's Discovery of his First and Second\r\nLaws.--Elliptical Theory of the Planets._\r\n\r\nTHE propositions designated as Kepler's First and Second Laws are\r\nthese: That the orbits of the planets are elliptical; and, That the\r\nareas described, or _swept_, by lines drawn from the sun to the\r\nplanet, are proportional to the times employed in the motion.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the discovery of these laws was the attempt to\r\nreconcile the theory of Mars to the theory of eccentrics and\r\nepicycles; the event of it was the complete overthrow of that\r\ntheory, and the establishment, in its stead, of the Elliptical\r\nTheory of the planets. Astronomy was now ripe for such a change. As\r\nsoon as Copernicus had taught men that the orbits of the planets\r\nwere to be referred to the sun, it obviously became a question, what\r\nwas the true form of these orbits, and the rule of motion of each\r\nplanet in its own orbit. Copernicus represented the motions in\r\nlongitude by means of {297} eccentrics and epicycles, as we have\r\nalready said; and the motions in latitude by certain _librations_,\r\nor alternate elevations and depressions of epicycles. If a\r\nmathematician had obtained a collection of true positions of a\r\nplanet, the form of the orbit and the motion of the star would have\r\nbeen determined with reference to the sun as well as to the earth;\r\nbut this was not possible, for though the _geocentric_ position, or\r\nthe direction in which the planet was seen, could be observed, its\r\ndistance from the earth was not known. Hence, when Kepler attempted\r\nto determine the orbit of a planet, he combined the observed\r\ngeocentric places with successive modifications of the theory of\r\nepicycles, till at last he was led, by one step after another, to\r\nchange the epicyclical into the elliptical theory. We may observe,\r\nmoreover, that at every step he endeavored to support his new\r\nsuppositions by what he called, in his fanciful phraseology,\r\n\"sending into the field a reserve of new physical reasonings on the\r\nrout and dispersion of the veterans;\"[35\\5] that is, by connecting\r\nhis astronomical hypotheses with new imaginations, when the old ones\r\nbecame untenable. We find, indeed, that this is the spirit in which\r\nthe pursuit of knowledge is generally carried on with success; those\r\nmen arrive at truth who eagerly endeavor to connect remote points of\r\ntheir knowledge, not those who stop cautiously at each point till\r\nsomething compels them to go beyond it.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\5: I will insert this passage, as a specimen of Kepler's\r\nfanciful mode of narrating the defeats which he received in the war\r\nwhich he carried on with Mars. \"Dum in hunc modum de Martis motibus\r\ntriumpho, eique ut planè devicto tabularum carceres et equationum\r\ncompedes necto, diversis nuntiatur locis, futilem victoriam ut\r\nbellam totâ mole recrudescere. Nam domi quidam hostis ut captivus\r\ncontemptus, rupit omnia equationum vincula, carceresque tabularum\r\neffregit. Foris speculatores profligerunt meas causarum physicarum\r\narcessitas copias earumque jugum excusserunt resumtà libertate.\r\nJamque parum abfuit quia hostis fugitivus sese cum rebellibus suis\r\nconjungeret meque in desperationem adigeret: nisi raptim, nova\r\nrationum physicarum subsidia, fusis et palantibus veteribus,\r\nsubmisissem, et qua se captivus proripuisset, omni diligentia,\r\nedoctus vestigiis ipsius nullâ morâ interpositâ inhæsisserem.\"]\r\n\r\nKepler joined Tycho Brahe at Prague in 1600, and found him and\r\nLongomontanus busily employed in correcting the theory of Mars; and\r\nhe also then entered upon that train of researches which he\r\npublished in 1609 in his extraordinary work _On the Motions of\r\nMars_. In this work, as in others, he gives an account, not only of\r\nhis success, but of his failures, explaining, at length, the various\r\nsuppositions which he had made, the notions by which he had been led\r\nto invent or to entertain them, the processes by which he had proved\r\ntheir {298} falsehood, and the alternations of hope and sorrow, of\r\nvexation and triumph, through which he had gone. It will not be\r\nnecessary for us to cite many passages of these kinds, curious and\r\namusing as they are.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important truths contained in the motions of Man is\r\nthe discovery that the plane of the orbit of the planet should be\r\nconsidered with reference to the sun itself, instead of referring it\r\nto any of the other centres of motion which the eccentric hypothesis\r\nintroduced: and that, when so considered, it had none of the\r\nlibrations which Ptolemy and Copernicus had attributed to it. The\r\nfourteenth chapter of the second part asserts, \"Plana eccentricorum\r\nesse ἀτάλαντα;\" that the planes are _unlibrating_; retaining always\r\nthe same inclination to the ecliptic, and the same _line of nodes_.\r\nWith this step Kepler appears to have been justly delighted.\r\n\"Copernicus,\" he says, \"not knowing the value of what he possessed\r\n(his system), undertook to represent Ptolemy, rather than nature, to\r\nwhich, however, he had approached more nearly than any other person.\r\nFor being rejoiced that the quantity of the latitude of each planet\r\nwas increased by the approach of the earth to the planet, according to\r\nhis theory, he did not venture to reject the rest of Ptolemy's\r\nincrease of latitude, but in order to express it, devised librations\r\nof the planes of the eccentric, depending not upon its own eccentric,\r\nbut (most improbably) upon the orbit of the earth, which has nothing\r\nto do with it. I always fought against this impertinent tying together\r\nof two orbits, even before I saw the observations of Tycho; and I\r\ntherefore rejoice much that in this, as in others of my preconceived\r\nopinions, the observations were found to be on my side.\" Kepler\r\nestablished his point by a fair and laborious calculation of the\r\nresults of observations of Mars made by himself and Tycho Brahe; and\r\nhad a right to exult when the result of these calculations confirmed\r\nhis views of the symmetry and simplicity of nature.\r\n\r\nWe may judge of the difficulty of casting off the theory of eccentrics\r\nand epicycles, by recollecting that Copernicus did not do it at all,\r\nand that Kepler only did it after repeated struggles; the history of\r\nwhich occupies thirty-nine Chapters of his book. At the end of them he\r\nsays, \"This prolix disputation was necessary, in order to prepare the\r\nway to the natural form of the equations, of which I am now to\r\ntreat.[36\\5] My first error was, that the path of a planet is a\r\nperfect circle;--an opinion which was a more mischievous thief of my\r\ntime, {299} in proportion as it was supported by the authority of all\r\nphilosophers, and apparently agreeable to metaphysics.\" But before he\r\nattempts to correct this erroneous part of his hypothesis, he sets\r\nabout discovering the law according to which the different parts of\r\nthe orbit are described in the case of the earth, in which case the\r\neccentricity is so small that the effect of the oval form is\r\ninsensible. The result of this inquiry was[37\\5] the Rule, that the\r\ntime of describing any arc of the orbit is proportional to the area\r\nintercepted between the curve and two lines drawn from the sun to the\r\nextremities of the arc. It is to be observed that this rule, at first,\r\nthough it had the recommendation of being selected after the\r\nunavoidable abandonment of many, which were suggested by the notions\r\nof those times, was far from being adopted upon any very rigid or\r\ncautious grounds. A rule had been proved at the apsides of the orbit,\r\nby calculation from observations, and had then been extended by\r\nconjecture to other parts of the orbit; and the rule of the areas was\r\nonly an approximate and inaccurate mode of representing this rule,\r\nemployed for the purpose of brevity and convenience, in consequence of\r\nthe difficulty of applying, geometrically, that which Kepler now\r\nconceived to be the true rule, and which required him to find the sum\r\nof the lines drawn from the sun to _every_ point of the orbit. When he\r\nproceeded to apply this rule to Mars, in whose orbit the oval form is\r\nmuch more marked, additional difficulties came in his way; and here\r\nagain the true supposition, that the _oval_ is of that special kind\r\ncalled _ellipse_, was adopted at first only in order to simplify\r\ncalculation,[38\\5] and the deviation from exactness in the result was\r\nattributed to the inaccuracy of those approximate processes. The\r\nsupposition of the oval had already been forced upon Purbach in the\r\ncase of Mercury, and upon Reinhold in the case of the Moon. The centre\r\nof the epicycle was made to describe an egg-shaped figure in the\r\nformer case, and a lenticular figure in the latter.[39\\5]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\5: _De Stellâ Martis_, iii. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\5: _De Stellâ Martis_, p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\5: Ib. iv. c. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\5: L. U. K. Kepler, p. 30.]\r\n\r\nIt may serve to show the kind of labor by which Kepler was led to\r\nhis result, if we here enumerate, as he does in his forty-seventh\r\nChapter,[40\\5] six hypotheses, on which he calculated the longitude\r\nof Mars, in order to see which best agreed with observation.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\5: _De Stellâ Martis_, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n1. The simple eccentricity.\r\n\r\n2. The bisection of the eccentricity, and the duplication of the\r\nsuperior part of the equation. {300}\r\n\r\n3. The bisection of the eccentricity, and a stationary point of\r\nequations, after the manner of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n4. The vicarious hypothesis by a free section of the eccentricity\r\nmade to agree as nearly as possible with the truth.\r\n\r\n5. The physical hypothesis on the supposition of a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n6. The physical hypothesis on the supposition of a perfect ellipse.\r\n\r\nBy the physical hypothesis, he meant the doctrine that the time of a\r\nplanet's describing any part of its orbit is proportional to the\r\ndistance of the planet from the sun, for which supposition, as we\r\nhave said, he conceived that he had assigned physical reasons.\r\n\r\nThe two last hypotheses came the nearest to the truth, and differed\r\nfrom it only by about eight minutes, the one in excess and the other\r\nin defect. And, after being much perplexed by this remaining error,\r\nit at last occurred to him[41\\5] that he might take another\r\nellipsis, exactly intermediate between the former one and the\r\ncircle, and that this must give the path and the motion of the\r\nplanet. Making this assumption, and taking the areas to represent\r\nthe times, he now saw[42\\5] that both the longitude and the\r\ndistances of Mars would agree with observation to the requisite\r\ndegree of accuracy. The rectification of the former hypothesis, when\r\nthus stated, may, perhaps, appear obvious. And Kepler informs us\r\nthat he had nearly been anticipated in this step (c. 55). \"David\r\nFabricius, to whom I had communicated my hypothesis of cap. 45, was\r\nable, by his observations, to show that it erred in making the\r\ndistances too short at mean longitudes; of which he informed me by\r\nletter while I was laboring, by repeated efforts, to discover the\r\ntrue hypothesis. So nearly did he get the start of me in detecting\r\nthe truth.\" But this was less easy than it might seem. When Kepler's\r\nfirst hypothesis was enveloped in the complex construction requisite\r\nin order to apply it to each point of the orbit, it was far more\r\ndifficult to see where the error lay, and Kepler hit upon it only by\r\nnoticing the coincidences of certain numbers, which, as he says,\r\nraised him as if from sleep, and gave him a new light. We may\r\nobserve, also, that he was perplexed to reconcile this new view,\r\naccording to which the planet described an exact ellipse, with his\r\nformer opinion, which represented the motion by means of libration\r\nin an epicycle. \"This,\" he says, \"was my greatest trouble, that,\r\nthough I considered and reflected till I was almost mad, I could not\r\nfind why the planet to which, with so much probability, and with\r\nsuch an exact {301} accordance of the distances, libration in the\r\ndiameter of the epicycle was attributed, should, according to the\r\nindication of the equations, go in an elliptical path. What an\r\nabsurdity on my part! as if libration in the diameter might not be a\r\nway to the ellipse!\"\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\5: _De Stellâ Martis_, c. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\5: Ibid. p. 235.]\r\n\r\nAnother scruple respecting this theory arose from the impossibility of\r\nsolving, by any geometrical construction, the problem to which Kepler\r\nwas thus led, namely, \"To divide the area of a semicircle in a given\r\nratio, by a line drawn from any point of the diameter.\" This is still\r\ntermed \"Kepler's Problem,\" and is, in fact, incapable of exact\r\ngeometrical solution. As, however, the calculation can be performed,\r\nand, indeed, was performed by Kepler himself, with a sufficient degree\r\nof accuracy to show that the elliptical hypothesis is true, the\r\ninsolubility of this problem is a mere mathematical difficulty in the\r\ndeductive process, to which Kepler's induction gave rise.\r\n\r\nOf Kepler's physical reasonings we shall speak more at length on\r\nanother occasion. His numerous and fanciful hypotheses had\r\ndischarged their office, when they had suggested to him his many\r\nlines of laborious calculation, and encouraged him under the\r\nexertions and disappointments to which these led. The result of this\r\nwork was the formal laws of the motion of Mars, established by a\r\nclear induction, since they represented, with sufficient accuracy,\r\nthe best observations. And we may allow that Kepler was entitled to\r\nthe praise which he claims in the motto on his first leaf. Ramus had\r\nsaid that if any one would construct an astronomy without\r\nhypothesis, he would be ready to resign to him his professorship in\r\nthe University of Paris. Kepler quotes this passage, and adds, \"it\r\nis well, Ramus, that you have run from this pledge, by quitting life\r\nand your professorship;[43\\5] if you held it still, I should, with\r\njustice, claim it.\" This was not saying too much, since he had\r\nentirely overturned the hypothesis of eccentrics and epicycles, and\r\nhad obtained a theory which was a mere representation of the motions\r\nand distances as they were observed. {302}\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\5: Ramus perished in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE EPOCH OF KEPLER. RECEPTION, VERIFICATION, AND\r\nEXTENSION OF THE ELLIPTICAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Application of the Elliptical Theory to the Planets._\r\n\r\nTHE extension of Kepler's discoveries concerning the orbit of Mars\r\nto the other planets, obviously offered itself as a strong\r\nprobability, and was confirmed by trial. This was made in the first\r\nplace upon the orbit of Mercury; which planet, in consequence of the\r\nlargeness of its eccentricity, exhibits more clearly than the others\r\nthe circumstances of the elliptical motion. These and various other\r\nsupplementary portions of the views to which Kepler's discoveries\r\nhad led, appeared in the latter part of his _Epitome Astronomiæ\r\nCopernicanæ_, published in 1622.\r\n\r\nThe real verification of the new doctrine concerning the orbits and\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies was, of course, to be found in the\r\nconstruction of tables of those motions, and in the continued\r\ncomparison of such tables with observation. Kepler's discoveries had\r\nbeen founded, as we have seen, principally on Tycho's observations.\r\nLongomontanus (so called as being a native of Langberg in Denmark),\r\npublished in 1621, in his _Astronomia Danica_, tables founded upon\r\nthe theories as well as the observations of his countryman.\r\nKepler[44\\5] in 1627 published his tables of the planets, which he\r\ncalled _Rudolphine Tables_, the result and application of his own\r\ntheory. In 1633, Lansberg, a Belgian, published also _Tabulæ\r\nPerpetuæ_, a work which was ushered into the world with considerable\r\npomp and pretension, and in which the author cavils very keenly at\r\nKepler and Brahe. We may judge of the impression made upon the\r\nastronomical world in general by these rival works, from the account\r\nwhich our countryman Jeremy Horrox has given of their effect on him.\r\nHe had been seduced by the magnificent promises of Lansberg, and the\r\npraises of his admirers, which are prefixed to the work, and was\r\npersuaded that the common opinion which preferred Tycho and Kepler\r\nto him was a prejudice. In 1636, however, he became acquainted with\r\nCrabtree, another young {303} astronomer, who lived in the same part\r\nof Lancashire. By him Horrox was warned that Lansberg was not to be\r\ndepended on; that his hypotheses were vicious, and his observations\r\nfalsified or forced into agreement with his theories. He then read\r\nthe works and adopted the opinions of Kepler; and after some\r\nhesitation which he felt at the thought of attacking the object of\r\nhis former idolatry, he wrote a dissertation on the points of\r\ndifference between them. It appears that, at one time, he intended\r\nto offer himself as the umpire who was to adjudge the prize of\r\nexcellence among the three rival theories of Longomontanus, Kepler,\r\nand Lansberg; and, in allusion to the story of ancient mythology,\r\nhis work was to have been called _Paris Astronomicus_; we easily see\r\nthat he would have given the golden apple to the Keplerian goddess.\r\nSucceeding observations confirmed his judgment: and the _Rudolphine\r\nTables_, thus published seventy-six years after the Prutenic, which\r\nwere founded on the doctrines of Copernicus, were for a long time\r\nthose universally used.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\5: Rheticus, _Narratio_, p. 98.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Application of the Elliptical Theory to the Moon._\r\n\r\nTHE reduction of the Moon's motions to rule was a harder task than\r\nthe formation of planetary tables, if accuracy was required; for the\r\nMoon's motion is affected by an incredible number of different and\r\ncomplex inequalities, which, till their law is detected, appear to\r\ndefy all theory. Still, however, progress was made in this work. The\r\nmost important advances were due to Tycho Brahe. In addition to the\r\nfirst and second inequalities of the moon (the _Equation of the\r\nCentre_, known very early, and the _Evection_, which Ptolemy had\r\ndiscovered), Tycho proved that there was another inequality, which\r\nhe termed the _Variation_,[45\\5] which depended on the moon's\r\nposition with respect to the sun, and which at its maximum was forty\r\nminutes and a half, about a quarter of the evection. He also\r\nperceived, though not very distinctly, the necessity of another\r\ncorrection of the moon's place depending on the sun's longitude,\r\nwhich has since been termed the _Annual Equation_.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\5:  We have seen (chap. iii.), that Aboul-Wefa, in the\r\ntenth century, had already noticed this inequality; but his\r\ndiscovery had been entirely forgotten long before the time of Tycho,\r\nand has only recently been brought again into notice.]\r\n\r\nThese steps concerned the Longitude of the Moon; Tycho also made\r\nimportant advances in the knowledge of the Latitude. The Inclination\r\nof the Orbit had hitherto been assumed to be the same at all {304}\r\ntimes; and the motion of the Node had been supposed uniform. He\r\nfound that the inclination increased and diminished by twenty\r\nminutes, according to the position of the line of nodes; and that\r\nthe nodes, though they regress upon the whole, sometimes go forwards\r\nand sometimes go backwards.\r\n\r\nTycho's discoveries concerning the moon are given in his\r\n_Progymnasmata_, which was published in 1603, two years after the\r\nauthor's death. He represents the Moon's motion in longitude by\r\nmeans of certain combinations of epicycles and eccentrics. But after\r\nKepler had shown that such devices are to be banished from the\r\nplanetary system, it was impossible not to think of extending the\r\nelliptical theory to the moon. Horrox succeeded in doing this; and\r\nin 1638 sent this essay to his friend Crabtree. It was published in\r\n1673, with the numerical elements requisite for its application\r\nadded by Flamsteed. Flamsteed had also (in 1671-2) compared this\r\ntheory with observation, and found that it agreed far more nearly\r\nthan the _Philolaic Tables_ of Bullialdus, or the _Carolinian\r\nTables_ of Street (_Epilogus ad Tabulas_). Moreover Horrox, by\r\nmaking the centre of the ellipse revolve in an epicycle, gave an\r\nexplanation of the evection, as well as of the equation of the\r\ncentre.[46\\5]\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\5: Horrox (_Horrockes_ as he himself spelt his name) gave a\r\nfirst sketch of his theory in letters to his friend Crabtree in\r\n1638: in which the variation of the eccentricity is not alluded to.\r\nBut in Crabtree's letter to Gascoigne in 1642, he gives Horrox's\r\nrule concerning it; and Flamsteed in his _Epilogue_ to the Tables,\r\npublished by Wallis along with Horrox's works in 1673, gave an\r\nexplanation of the theory which made it amount very nearly to a\r\nrevolution of the centre of the ellipse in an epicycle. Halley\r\nafterwards made a slight alteration; but hardly, I think, enough to\r\njustify Newton's assertion (_Princip._ Lib. iii. Prop. 35, Schol.),\r\n\"Halleius centrum ellipseos in epicyclo locavit.\" See Baily's\r\n_Flamsteed_, p. 683.]\r\n\r\nModern astronomers, by calculating the effects of the perturbing\r\nforces of the solar system, and comparing their calculations with\r\nobservation, have added many new corrections or equations to those\r\nknown at the time of Horrox; and since the Motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies were even then affected by these variations as yet\r\nundetected, it is clear that the Tables of that time must have shown\r\nsome errors when compared with observation. These errors much\r\nperplexed astronomers, and naturally gave rise to the question\r\nwhether the motions of the heavenly bodies really were exactly\r\nregular, or whether they were not affected by accidents as little\r\nreducible to rule as wind and weather. Kepler had held the opinion\r\nof the _casualty_ of such errors; but Horrox, far more\r\nphilosophically, argues against this opinion, though he {305} allows\r\nthat he is much embarrassed by the deviations. His arguments show a\r\nsingularly clear and strong apprehension of the features of the\r\ncase, and their real import. He says,[47\\5] \"these errors of the\r\ntables are alternately in excess and defect; how could this constant\r\ncompensation happen if they were casual? Moreover, the alternation\r\nfrom excess to defect is most rapid in the Moon, most slow in\r\nJupiter and Saturn, in which planets the error continues sometimes\r\nfor years. If the errors were casual, why should they not last as\r\nlong in the Moon as in Saturn? But if we suppose the tables to be\r\nright in the mean motions, but wrong in the equations, these facts\r\nare just what must happen; since Saturn's inequalities are of long\r\nperiod, while those of the Moon are numerous, and rapidly changing.\"\r\nIt would be impossible, at the present moment, to reason better on\r\nthis subject; and the doctrine, that all the apparent irregularities\r\nof the celestial motions are really regular, was one of great\r\nconsequence to establish at this period of the science.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\5: _Astron. Kepler._ Proleg. p. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Causes of the further Progress of Astronomy._\r\n\r\nWE are now arrived at the time when theory and observation sprang\r\nforwards with emulous energy. The physical theories of Kepler, and\r\nthe reasonings of other defenders of the Copernican theory, led\r\ninevitably, after some vagueness and perplexity, to a sound science\r\nof Mechanics; and this science in time gave a new face to Astronomy.\r\nBut in the mean time, while mechanical mathematicians were\r\ngeneralizing from the astronomy already established, astronomers\r\nwere accumulating new facts, which pointed the way to new theories\r\nand new generalizations. Copernicus, while he had established the\r\npermanent length of the year, had confirmed the motion of the sun's\r\napogee, and had shown that the eccentricity of the earth's orbit,\r\nand the obliquity of the ecliptic, were gradually, though slowly,\r\ndiminishing. Tycho had accumulated a store of excellent\r\nobservations. These, as well as the laws of the motions of the moon\r\nand planets already explained, were materials on which the Mechanics\r\nof the Universe was afterwards to employ its most matured powers. In\r\nthe mean time, the telescope had opened other new subjects of notice\r\nand speculation; not only confirming the Copernican doctrine by the\r\nphases of Venus, and the analogical examples of Jupiter and Saturn,\r\nwhich with their Satellites {306} appeared like models of the Solar\r\nSystem; but disclosing unexpected objects, as the Ring of Saturn,\r\nand the Spots of the Sun. The art of observing made rapid advances,\r\nboth by the use of the telescope, and by the sounder notions of the\r\nconstruction of instruments which Tycho introduced. Copernicus had\r\nlaughed at Rheticus, when he was disturbed about single minutes; and\r\ndeclared that if he could be sure to ten minutes of space, he should\r\nbe as much delighted as Pythagoras was when he discovered the\r\nproperty of the right-angled triangle. But Kepler founded the\r\nrevolution which he introduced on a quantity less than this.\r\n\"Since,\" he says,[48\\5] \"the Divine Goodness has given us in Tycho\r\nan observer so exact that this error of eight minutes is impossible,\r\nwe must be thankful to God for this, and turn it to account. And\r\nthese eight minutes, which we must not neglect, will, of themselves,\r\nenable us to reconstruct the whole of astronomy.\" In addition to\r\nother improvements, the art of numerical calculation made an\r\ninestimable advance by means of Napier's invention of Logarithms;\r\nand the progress of other parts of pure mathematics was proportional\r\nto the calls which astronomy and physics made upon them.\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\5: _De Stellâ Martis_, c. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe exactness which observation had attained enabled astronomers\r\nboth to verify and improve the existing theories, and to study the\r\nyet unsystematized facts. The science was, therefore, forced along\r\nby a strong impulse on all sides, and its career assumed a new\r\ncharacter. Up to this point, the history of European Astronomy was\r\nonly the sequel of the history of Greek Astronomy; for the\r\nheliocentric system, as we have seen, had had a place among the\r\nguesses, at least, of the inventive and acute intellects of the\r\nGreek philosophers. But the discovery of Kepler's Laws, accompanied,\r\nas from the first they were, with a conviction that the relations\r\nthus brought to light were the effects and exponents of physical\r\ncauses, led rapidly and irresistibly to the Mechanical Science of\r\nthe skies, and collaterally, to the Mechanical Science of the other\r\nparts of Nature: Sound, and Light, and Heat; and Magnetism, and\r\nElectricity, and Chemistry. The history of these Sciences, thus\r\ntreated, forms the sequel of the present work, and will be the\r\nsubject of the succeeding volumes. And since, as I have said, our\r\nmain object in this work is to deduce, from the history of science,\r\nthe philosophy of scientific discovery, it may be regarded as\r\nfortunate for our purpose that the history, after this point, so far\r\nchanges its aspect as to offer new materials for such speculations.\r\nThe details of {307} a history of astronomy, such as the history of\r\nastronomy since Newton has been, though interesting to the special\r\nlovers of that science, would be too technical, and the features of\r\nthe narrative too monotonous and unimpressive, to interest the\r\ngeneral reader, or to suggest a comprehensive philosophy of science.\r\nBut when we pass from the Ideas of Space and Time to the Ideas of\r\nForce and Matter, of Mediums by which action and sensation are\r\nproduced, and of the Intimate Constitution of material bodies, we\r\nhave new fields of inquiry opened to us. And when we find that in\r\nthese fields, as well as in astronomy, there are large and striking\r\ntrains of unquestioned discovery to be narrated, we may gird\r\nourselves afresh to the task of writing, and I hope, of reading, the\r\nremaining part of the History of the Inductive Sciences, in the\r\ntrust that it will in some measure help us to answer the important\r\nquestions, What is Truth? and, How is it to be discovered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{309}}\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\n_THE MECHANICAL SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MECHANICS,\r\nINCLUDING\r\nFLUID MECHANICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ΚΡΑΤΟΣ ΒIΑ ΤΕ, σφῷν μὲν ἐντολὴ Διὸς\r\n  Ἔχει Τέλος δὴ, κ' οὐδὲν ἐμποδῶν ἔτι\r\n          ÆSCHYLUS. _Prom.

In passing from\r\nAstronomy to Mechanics we make a transition from the _formal_ to the\r\n_physical_ sciences;--from time and space to force and matter;--from\r\n_phenomena_ to _causes_. Hitherto we have been concerned only with\r\nthe paths and orbits, the periods and cycles, the angles and\r\ndistances, of the objects to which our sciences applied, namely, the\r\nheavenly bodies. How these motions are produced;--by what agencies,\r\nimpulses, powers, they are determined to be what they are;--of what\r\nnature are the objects themselves;--are speculations which we have\r\nhitherto not dwelt upon. The history of such speculations now comes\r\nbefore us; but, in the first place, we must consider the history of\r\nspeculations concerning motion in general, terrestrial as well as\r\ncelestial. We must first attend to Mechanics, and afterwards return\r\nto Physical Astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn the same way in which the development of Pure Mathematics, which\r\nbegan with the Greeks, was a necessary condition of the progress of\r\nFormal Astronomy, the creation of the science of Mechanics now\r\nbecame necessary to the formation and progress of Physical\r\nAstronomy. Geometry and Mechanics were studied for their own sakes;\r\nbut they also supplied ideas, language, and reasoning to other\r\nsciences. If the Greeks had not cultivated Conic Sections, Kepler\r\ncould not have superseded Ptolemy; if the Greeks had cultivated\r\nDynamics,[1\\6] Kepler might have anticipated Newton. {312}\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\6: _Dynamics_ is the science which treats of the Motions of\r\nBodies; _Statics_ is the science which treats of the Pressure of\r\nBodies which are in equilibrium, and therefore at rest.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE EPOCH OF GALILEO.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Prelude to the Science of Statics._\r\n\r\nSOME steps in the science of Motion, or rather in the science of\r\nEquilibrium, had been made by the ancients, as we have seen.\r\nArchimedes established satisfactorily the doctrine of the Lever,\r\nsome important properties of the Centre of Gravity, and the\r\nfundamental proposition of Hydrostatics. But this beginning led to\r\nno permanent progress. Whether the distinction between the\r\nprinciples of the doctrine of Equilibrium and of Motion was clearly\r\nseen by Archimedes, we do not know; but it never was caught hold of\r\nby any of the other writers of antiquity, or by those of the\r\nStationary Period. What was still worse, the point which Archimedes\r\nhad won was not steadily maintained.\r\n\r\nWe have given some examples of the general ignorance of the Greek\r\nphilosophers on such subjects, in noticing the strange manner in\r\nwhich Aristotle refers to mathematical properties, in order to\r\naccount for the equilibrium of a lever, and the attitude of a man\r\nrising from a chair. And we have seen, in speaking of the indistinct\r\nideas of the Stationary Period, that the attempts which were made to\r\nextend the statical doctrine of Archimedes, failed, in such a manner\r\nas to show that his followers had not clearly apprehended the idea\r\non which his reasoning altogether depended. The clouds which he had,\r\nfor a moment, cloven in his advance, closed after him, and the\r\nformer dimness and confusion settled again on the land.\r\n\r\nThis dimness and confusion, with respect to all subjects of\r\nmechanical reasoning, prevailed still, at the period we now have to\r\nconsider; namely, the period of the first promulgation of the\r\nCopernican opinions. This is so important a point that I must\r\nillustrate it further.\r\n\r\nCertain general notions of the connection of cause and effect in\r\nmotion, exist in the human mind at all periods of its development, and\r\nare implied in the formation of language and in the most familiar\r\nemployments of men's thoughts. But these do not constitute a _science_\r\nof {313} Mechanics, any more than the notions of _square_ and _round_\r\nmake a Geometry, or the notions of _months_ and _years_ make an\r\nAstronomy. The unfolding these Notions into distinct Ideas, on which\r\ncan be founded principles and reasonings, is further requisite, in\r\norder to produce a science; and, with respect to the doctrines of\r\nMotion, this was long in coming to pass; men's thoughts remained long\r\nentangled in their primitive and unscientific confusion.\r\n\r\nWe may mention one or two features of this confusion, such as we\r\nfind in authors belonging to the period now under review.\r\n\r\nWe have already, in speaking of the Greek School Philosophy, noticed\r\nthe attempt to explain some of the differences among Motions, by\r\nclassifying them into Natural Motions and Violent Motions; and we have\r\nspoken of the assertion that heavy bodies fall quicker in proportion\r\nto their greater weight. These doctrines were still retained: yet the\r\nviews which they implied were essentially erroneous and unsound; for\r\nthey did not refer distinctly to a measurable Force as the cause of\r\nall motion or change of motion; and they confounded the causes which\r\n_produce_ and those which _preserve_, motion. Hence such principles\r\ndid not lead immediately to any advance of knowledge, though efforts\r\nwere made to apply them, in the cases both of terrestrial Mechanics\r\nand of the motions of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Inclined Plane was one of the first, as it was one\r\nof the most important, propositions, on which modern writers employed\r\nthemselves. It was found that a body, when supported on a sloping\r\nsurface, might be sustained or raised by a force or exertion which\r\nwould not have been able to sustain or raise it without such support.\r\nAnd hence, _The Inclined Plane_ was placed in the list of Mechanical\r\nPowers, or simple machines by which the efficacy of forces is\r\nincreased: the question was, in what proportion this increase of\r\nefficiency takes place. It is easily seen that the force requisite to\r\nsustain a body is smaller, as the slope on which it rests is smaller;\r\nCardan (whose work, _De Proportionibus Numerorum, Motuum, Ponderum,_\r\n&c., was published in 1545) asserts that the force is double when the\r\nangle of inclination is double, and so on for other proportions; this\r\nis probably a guess, and is an erroneous one. Guido Ubaldi, of\r\nMarchmont, published at Pesaro, in 1577, a work which he called\r\n_Mechanicorum Liber_, in which he endeavors to prove that an acute\r\nwedge will produce a greater mechanical effect than an obtuse one,\r\nwithout determining in what proportion. There is, he observes, \"a\r\ncertain repugnance\" between the direction in which the side of the\r\nwedge tends to {314} move the obstacle, and the direction in which it\r\nreally does move. Thus the Wedge and the Inclined Plane are connected\r\nin principle. He also refers the Screw to the Inclined Plane and the\r\nWedge, in a manner which shows a just apprehension of the question.\r\nBenedetti (1585) treats the Wedge in a different manner; not exact,\r\nbut still showing some powers of thought on mechanical subjects.\r\nMichael Varro, whose _Tractatus de Motu_ was published at Geneva in\r\n1584, deduces the wedge from the composition of hypothetical motions,\r\nin a way which may appear to some persons an anticipation of the\r\ndoctrine of the Composition of Forces.\r\n\r\nThere is another work on subjects of this kind, of which several\r\neditions were published in the sixteenth century, and which treats\r\nthis matter in nearly the same way as Varro, and in favour of which a\r\nclaim has been made[2\\6] (I think an unfounded one), as if it\r\ncontained the true principle of this problem. The work is \"Jordanus\r\nNemorarius _De Ponderositate_.\" The date and history of this author\r\nwere probably even then unknown; for in 1599, Benedetti, correcting\r\nsome of the errors of Tartalea, says they are taken \"a Jordano quodam\r\nantiquo.\" The book was probably a kind of school-book, and much used;\r\nfor an edition printed at Frankfort, in 1533, is stated to be _Cum\r\ngratia et privilegio Imperiali, Petro Apiano mathematico Ingolstadiano\r\nad xxx annos concesso_. But this edition does not contain the Inclined\r\nPlane. Though those who compiled the work assert in words something\r\nlike the inverse proportion of Weights and their Velocities, they had\r\nnot learnt at that time how to apply this maxim to the Inclined Plane;\r\nnor were they ever able to render a sound reason for it. In the\r\nedition of Venice, 1565, however, such an application is attempted.\r\nThe reasonings are founded on the Aristotelian assumption, \"that\r\nbodies descend more quickly in proportion as they are heavier.\" To\r\nthis principle are added some others; as, that \"a body is heavier in\r\nproportion as it descends more directly to the centre,\" and that, in\r\nproportion as a body descends more obliquely, the intercepted part of\r\nthe direct descent is smaller. By means of these principles, the\r\n\"descending force\" of bodies, on inclined planes, was compared, by a\r\nprocess, which, so far as it forms a line of proof at all, is a\r\nsomewhat curious example of confused and vicious reasoning. When two\r\nbodies are supported on two inclined planes, and are connected by a\r\nstring passing over the junction of the planes, so that when one\r\ndescends the other ascends, {315} they must move through equal spaces\r\non the planes; but on the plane which is more oblique (that is, more\r\nnearly horizontal), the vertical descent will be smaller in the same\r\nproportion in which the plane is longer. Hence, by the Aristotelian\r\nprinciple, the weight of the body on the longer plane is less; and, to\r\nproduce an equality of effect, the body must be greater in the same\r\nproportion. We may observe that the Aristotelian principle is not only\r\nfalse, but is here misapplied; for its genuine meaning is, that when\r\nbodies _fall freely_ by gravity, they move quicker in proportion as\r\nthey are heavier; but the rule is here applied to the motions which\r\nbodies _would_ have, if they were moved by a force extraneous to their\r\ngravity. The proposition was supposed by the Aristotelians to be true\r\nof _actual_ velocities; it is applied by Jordanus to _virtual_\r\nvelocities, without his being aware what he was doing. This confusion\r\nbeing made, the result is got at by taking for granted that bodies\r\n_thus_ proved to be equally _heavy_, have equal powers of descent on\r\nthe inclined planes; whereas, in the previous part of the reasoning,\r\nthe weight was supposed to be proportional to the descent in the\r\nvertical direction. It is obvious, in all this, that though the author\r\nhad adopted the false Aristotelian principle, he had not settled in\r\nhis own mind whether the motions of which it spoke were actual or\r\nvirtual motions;--motions in the direction of the inclined plane, or\r\nof the intercepted parts of the vertical, corresponding to these; nor\r\nwhether the \"descending force\" of a body was something different from\r\nits weight. We cannot doubt that, if he had been required to point\r\nout, with any exactness, the cases to which his reasoning applied, he\r\nwould have been unable to do so; not possessing any of those clear\r\nfundamental Ideas of Pressure and Force, on which alone any real\r\nknowledge on such subjects must depend. The whole of Jordanus's\r\nreasoning is an example of the confusion of thought of his period, and\r\nof nothing more. It no more supplied the want of some man of genius,\r\nwho should give the subject a real scientific foundation, than\r\nAristotle's knowledge of the proportion of the weights on the lever\r\nsuperseded the necessity of Archimedes's proof of it.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\6: Mr. Drinkwater's _Life of Galileo_, in the Lib. Usef. Kn.\r\np. 83.]\r\n\r\nWe are not, therefore, to wonder that, though this pretended theorem\r\nwas copied by other writers, as by Tartalea, in his _Quesiti et\r\nInventioni Diversi_, published in 1554, no progress was made in the\r\nreal solution of any one mechanical problem by means of it. Guido\r\nUbaldi, who, in 1577, writes in such a manner as to show that he had\r\ntaken a good hold of his subject for his time, refers to Pappus's\r\nsolution of the problem of the Inclined Plane,  but makes no mention\r\nof that of {316} Jordanus and Tartalea.[3\\6] No progress was likely\r\nto occur, till the mathematicians had distinctly recovered the\r\ngenuine Idea of Pressure, as a Force producing equilibrium, which\r\nArchimedes had possessed, and which was soon to reappear in Stevinus.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\6: Ubaldi mentions and blames Jordanus's way of treating the\r\nLever. (See his Preface.)]\r\n\r\nThe properties of the Lever had always continued known to\r\nmathematicians, although, in the dark period, the superiority of the\r\nproof given by Archimedes had not been recognized. We are not to be\r\nsurprised, if reasonings like those of Jordanus were applied to\r\ndemonstrate the theories of the Lever with apparent success. Writers\r\non Mechanics were, as we have seen, so vacillating in their mode of\r\ndealing with words and propositions, that their maxims could be made\r\nto prove any thing which was already known to be true.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to speak of the beginning of the real progress of\r\nMechanics in modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Revival of the Scientific Idea of\r\nPressure.--Stevinus.--Equilibrium of Oblique Forces._\r\n\r\nTHE doctrine of the Centre of Gravity was the part of the mechanical\r\nspeculations of Archimedes which was most diligently prosecuted\r\nafter his time. Pappus and others, among the ancients, had solved\r\nsome new problems on this subject, and Commandinus, in 1565,\r\npublished _De Centro Gravitatis Solidorum_. Such treatises\r\ncontained, for the most part, only mathematical consequences of the\r\ndoctrines of Archimedes; but the mathematicians also retained a\r\nsteady conviction of the mechanical property of the Centre of\r\nGravity, namely, that all the weight of the body might be collected\r\nthere, without any change in the mechanical results; a conviction\r\nwhich is closely connected with our fundamental conceptions of\r\nmechanical action. Such a principle, also, will enable us to\r\ndetermine the result of many simple mechanical arrangements; for\r\ninstance, if a mathematician of those days had been asked whether a\r\nsolid ball could be made of such a form, that, when placed on a\r\nhorizontal plane, it should go on rolling forwards without limit\r\nmerely by the effect of its own weight, he would probably have\r\nanswered, that it could not; for that the centre of gravity of the\r\nball would seek the lowest position it could find, and that, when it\r\nhad found this, the ball could have no tendency to roll any further.\r\nAnd, in making this assertion, the supposed reasoner would not be\r\n{317} anticipating any wider proof of the impossibility of a\r\n_perpetual motion_ drawn from principles subsequently discovered,\r\nbut would be referring the question to certain fundamental\r\nconvictions, which, whether put into Axioms or not, inevitably\r\naccompany our mechanical conceptions.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Stevinus of Bruges, in 1586, when he published his\r\n_Beghinselen der Waaghconst_ (Principles of Equilibrium), had been\r\nasked why a loop of chain, hung over a triangular beam, could not,\r\nas he asserted it could not, go on moving round and round\r\nperpetually, by the action of its own weight, he would probably have\r\nanswered, that the weight of the chain, if it produced motion at\r\nall, must have a tendency to bring it into some certain position,\r\nand that when the chain had reached this position, it would have no\r\ntendency to go any further; and thus he would have reduced the\r\nimpossibility of such a perpetual motion, to the conception of\r\ngravity, as a force tending to produce equilibrium; a principle\r\nperfectly sound and correct.\r\n\r\nUpon this principle thus applied, Stevinus did establish the\r\nfundamental property of the Inclined Plane. He supposed a loop of\r\nstring, loaded with fourteen equal balls at equal distances, to hang\r\nover a triangular support which was composed of two inclined planes\r\nwith a horizontal base, and whose sides, being unequal in the\r\nproportion of two to one, supported four and two balls respectively.\r\nHe showed that this loop must hang at rest, because any motion would\r\nonly bring it into the same condition in which it was at first; and\r\nthat the festoon of eight balls which hung down below the triangle\r\nmight be removed without disturbing the equilibrium; so that four\r\nballs on the longer plane would balance two balls on the shorter\r\nplane; or in other words, the weights would be as the lengths of the\r\nplanes intercepted by the horizontal line.\r\n\r\nStevinus showed his firm possession of the truth contained in this\r\nprinciple, by deducing from it the properties of forces acting in\r\noblique directions under all kinds of conditions; in short, he\r\nshowed his entire ability to found upon it a complete doctrine of\r\nequilibrium; and upon his foundations, and without any additional\r\nsupport, the mathematical doctrines of Statics might have been\r\ncarried to the highest pitch of perfection they have yet reached.\r\nThe formation of the science was finished; the mathematical\r\ndevelopment and exposition of it were alone open to extension and\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [\"Simon Stevin of Bruges,\" as he usually designates himself\r\nin the title-page of his work, has lately become an object of\r\ngeneral interest in his own country, and it has been resolved to\r\nerect a {318} statue in honor of him in one of the public places of\r\nhis native city. He was born in 1548, as I learn from M. Quetelet's\r\nnotice of him, and died in 1620. Montucla says that he died in 1633;\r\nmisled apparently by the preface to Albert Girard's edition of\r\nStevin's works, which was published in 1634, and which speaks of a\r\ndeath which took place in the preceding year; but on examination it\r\nwill be seen that this refers to Girard, not to Stevin.\r\n\r\nI ought to have mentioned, in consideration of the importance of the\r\nproposition, that Stevin distinctly states the _triangle of forces_;\r\nnamely, that three forces which act upon a point are in equilibrium\r\nwhen they are parallel and proportional to the three sides of any\r\nplane triangle. This includes the principle of the _Composition of\r\nStatical Forces_. Stevin also applies his principle of equilibrium\r\nto cordage, pulleys, funicular polygons, and especially to the bits\r\nof bridles; a branch of mechanics which he calls _Chalinothlipsis_.\r\n\r\nHe has also the merit of having seen very clearly, the distinction\r\nof statical and dynamical problems. He remarks that the question,\r\n\"What force will _support_ a loaded wagon on an inclined plane? is a\r\nstatical question, depending on simple conditions; but that the\r\nquestion, What force will _move_ the wagon? requires additional\r\nconsiderations to be introduced.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter iv. of this Book, I have noticed Stevin's share in the\r\nrediscovery of the _Laws of the Equilibrium of Fluids_. He\r\ndistinctly explains the _hydrostatic paradox_, of which the\r\ndiscovery is generally ascribed to Pascal.\r\n\r\nEarlier than Stevinus, Leonardo da Vinci must have a place among the\r\ndiscoverers of the Conditions of Equilibrium of Oblique Forces. He\r\npublished no work on this subject; but extracts from his manuscripts\r\nhave been published by Venturi, in his _Essai sur les Ouvrages\r\nPhysico-Mathematiques de Leonard da Vinci, avec des Fragmens tirés\r\nde ses Manuscrits apportés d'Italie_, Paris, 1797: and by Libri, in\r\nhis _Hist. des Sc. Math. en Italie_, 1839. I have also myself\r\nexamined these manuscripts in the Royal Library at Paris.\r\n\r\nIt appears that, as early as 1499, Leonardo gave a perfectly correct\r\nstatement of the proportion of the forces exerted by a cord which\r\nacts obliquely and supports a weight on a lever. He distinguishes\r\nbetween the real lever, and the _potential levers_, that is, the\r\nperpendiculars drawn from the centre upon the directions of the\r\nforces. This is quite sound and satisfactory. These views must in\r\nall probability have been sufficiently promulgated in Italy to\r\ninfluence the speculations of Galileo; {319} whose reasonings\r\nrespecting the lever much resemble those of Leonardo.--Da Vinci also\r\nanticipated Galileo in _asserting_ that the time of descent of a\r\nbody down an inclined plane is to the time of descent down its\r\nvertical length in the proportion of the length of the plane to the\r\nheight. But this cannot, I think, have been more than a guess: there\r\nis no vestige of a proof given.]\r\n\r\nThe contemporaneous progress of the other branch of mechanics, the\r\nDoctrine of Motion, interfered with this independent advance of\r\nStatics; and to that we must now turn. We may observe, however, that\r\ntrue propositions respecting the composition of forces appear to\r\nhave rapidly diffused themselves. The _Tractatus de Motu_ of Michael\r\nVarro of Geneva, already noticed, printed in 1584, had asserted,\r\nthat the forces which balance each other, acting on the sides of a\r\nright-angled triangular wedge, are in the proportion of the sides of\r\nthe triangle; and although this assertion does not appear to have\r\nbeen derived from a distinct idea of pressure, the author had hence\r\nrightly deduced the properties of the wedge and the screw. And\r\nshortly after this time, Galileo also established the same results\r\non different principles. In his Treatise _Delle Scienze Mecaniche_\r\n(1592), he refers the Inclined Plane to the Lever, in a sound and\r\nnearly satisfactory manner; imagining a lever so placed, that the\r\nmotion of a body at the extremity of one of its arms should be in\r\nthe same direction as it is upon the plane. A slight modification\r\nmakes this an unexceptionable proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Prelude to the Science of Dynamics.--Attempts at the\r\nFirst Law of Motion._\r\n\r\nWE have already seen, that Aristotle divided Motions into Natural\r\nand Violent. Cardan endeavored to improve this division by making\r\nthree classes: _Voluntary_ Motion, which is circular and uniform,\r\nand which is intended to include the celestial motions; _Natural_\r\nMotion, which is stronger towards the end, as the motion of a\r\nfalling body,--this is in a straight line, because it is motion to\r\nan end, and nature seeks her ends by the shortest road; and thirdly,\r\n_Violent_ Motion, including in this term all kinds different from\r\nthe former two. Cardan was aware that such Violent Motion might be\r\nproduced by a very small force; thus he asserts, that a spherical\r\nbody resting on a horizontal plane may be put in motion by any force\r\nwhich is sufficient to cleave the air; for which, however, he\r\nerroneously assigns as a reason, {320} the smallness of the point of\r\ncontact.[4\\6] But the most common mistake of this period was, that\r\nof supposing that as force is requisite to move a body, so a\r\nperpetual supply of force is requisite to keep it in motion. The\r\nwhole of what Kepler called his \"physical\" reasoning, depended upon\r\nthis assumption. He endeavored to discover the forces by which the\r\nmotions of the planets about the sun might be produced; but, in all\r\ncases, he considered the velocity of the planet as produced by, and\r\nexhibiting the effect of, a force which acted in the direction of\r\nthe motion. Kepler's essays, which are in this respect so feeble and\r\nunmeaning, have sometimes been considered as disclosing some distant\r\nanticipation of Newton's discovery of the existence and law of\r\ncentral forces. There is, however, in reality, no other connection\r\nbetween these speculations than that which arises from the use of\r\nthe term _force_ by the two writers in two utterly different\r\nmeanings. Kepler's Forces were certain imaginary qualities which\r\nappeared in the actual motion which the bodies had; Newton's Forces\r\nwere causes which appeared by the change of motion: Kepler's Forces\r\nurged the bodies forwards; Newton's deflected the bodies from such a\r\nprogress. If Kepler's Forces were destroyed, the body would\r\ninstantly stop; if Newton's were annihilated, the body would go on\r\nuniformly in a straight line. Kepler compares the action of his\r\nForces to the way in which a body might be driven round, by being\r\nplaced among the sails of a windmill; Newton's Forces would be\r\nrepresented by a rope pulling the body to the centre. Newton's Force\r\nis merely mutual attraction; Kepler's is something quite different\r\nfrom this; for though he perpetually illustrates his views by the\r\nexample of a magnet, he warns us that the sun differs from the\r\nmagnet in this respect, that its force is not attractive, but\r\ndirective.[5\\6] Kepler's essays may with considerable reason be\r\nasserted to be an anticipation of the Vortices of Descartes; but\r\nthey can with no propriety whatever be said to anticipate Newton's\r\nDynamical Theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\6: In speaking of the force which would draw a body up an\r\ninclined plane he observes, that \"per communem animi sententiam,\"\r\nwhen the plane becomes horizontal, the requisite force is nothing.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\6: _Epitome Astron. Copern._ p. 176.]\r\n\r\nThe confusion of thought which prevented mathematicians from seeing\r\nthe difference between producing and preserving motion, was, indeed,\r\nfatal to all attempts at progress on this subject. We have already\r\nnoticed the perplexity in which Aristotle involved himself, by his\r\nendeavors to find a reason for the continued motion of a stone {321}\r\nafter the moving power had ceased to act; and that he had ascribed\r\nit to the effect of the air or other medium in which the stone\r\nmoves. Tartalea, whose _Nuova Scienza_ is dated 1550, though a good\r\n_pure_ mathematician, is still quite in the dark on mechanical\r\nmatters. One of his propositions, in the work just mentioned, is (B.\r\ni. Prop. 3), \"The more a heavy body recedes from the beginning, or\r\napproaches the end of violent motion, the slower and more inertly it\r\ngoes;\" which he applies to the horizontal motion of projectiles. In\r\nlike manner most other writers about this period conceived that a\r\ncannon-ball goes forwards till it loses all its projectile motion,\r\nand then falls downwards. Benedetti, who has already been mentioned,\r\nmust be considered as one of the first enlightened opponents of this\r\nand other Aristotelian errors or puzzles. In his _Speculationum\r\nLiber_ (Venice, 1585), he opposes Aristotle's mechanical opinions,\r\nwith great expressions of respect, but in a very sweeping manner.\r\nHis chapter xxiv. is headed, \"Whether this eminent man was right in\r\nhis opinion concerning violent and natural motion.\" And after\r\nstating the Aristotelian opinion just mentioned, that the body is\r\nimpelled by the air, he says that the air must impede rather than\r\nimpel the body, and that[6\\6] \"the motion of the body, separated\r\nfrom the mover, arises by a certain natural impression from the\r\nimpetuosity (_ex impetuositate_) received from the mover.\" He adds,\r\nthat in natural motions this _impetuosity_ continually increases by\r\nthe continued action of the cause,--namely, the propension of going\r\nto the place assigned it by nature; and that thus the velocity\r\nincreases as the body moves from the beginning of its path. This\r\nstatement shows a clearness of conception with regard to the cause\r\nof accelerated motion, which Galileo himself was long in acquiring.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\6: P. 184.]\r\n\r\nThough Benedetti was thus on the way to the First Law of\r\nMotion,--that all motion is uniform and rectilinear, except so far\r\nas it is affected by extraneous forces;--this Law was not likely to\r\nbe either generally conceived, or satisfactorily proved, till the\r\nother Laws of Motion, by which the action of Forces is regulated,\r\nhad come into view. Hence, though a partial apprehension of this\r\nprinciple had preceded the discovery of the Laws of Motion, we must\r\nplace the establishment of the principle in the period when those\r\nLaws were detected and established, the period of Galileo and his\r\nfollowers. {322}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nINDUCTIVE EPOCH OF GALILEO.--DISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF MOTION IN\r\nSIMPLE CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Establishment of the First Law of Motion._\r\n\r\nAFTER mathematicians had begun to doubt or reject the authority of\r\nAristotle, they were still some time in coming to the conclusion,\r\nthat the distinction of Natural and Violent Motions was altogether\r\nuntenable;--that the velocity of a body in motion increased or\r\ndiminished in consequence of the action of extrinsic causes, not of\r\nany property of the motion itself;--and that the apparently\r\nuniversal fact, of bodies growing slower and slower, as if by their\r\nown disposition, till they finally stopped, from which Motions had\r\nbeen called Violent, arose from the action of external obstacles not\r\nimmediately obvious, as the friction and the resistance of the air\r\nwhen a ball runs on the ground, and the action of gravity, when it\r\nis thrown upwards. But the truth to which they were at last led,\r\nwas, that such causes would account for _all_ the diminution of\r\nvelocity which bodies experience when apparently left to themselves\r\nand that without such causes, the motion of all bodies would go on\r\nforever, in a straight line and with a uniform velocity.\r\n\r\nWho first announced this Law in a general form, it may be difficult\r\nto point out; its exact or approximate truth was necessarily taken\r\nfor granted in all complete investigations on the subject of the\r\nlaws of motion of falling bodies, and of bodies projected so as to\r\ndescribe curves. In Galileo's first attempt to solve the problem of\r\nfalling bodies, he did not carry his analysis back to the notion of\r\nforce, and therefore this law does not appear. In 1604 he had an\r\nerroneous opinion on this subject  and we do not know when he was\r\nled to the true doctrine which he published in his _Discorso_, in\r\n1638. In his third Dialogue he gives the instance of water in a\r\nvessel, for the purpose of showing that circular motion has a\r\ntendency to continue. And in his first Dialogue on the Copernican\r\nSystem[7\\6] (published in 1630), he asserts {323} Circular Motion\r\nalone to be naturally uniform, and retains the distinction between\r\nNatural and Violent Motion. In the _Dialogues on Mechanics_,\r\nhowever, published in 1638, but written apparently at an earlier\r\nperiod, in treating of Projectiles,[8\\6] he asserts the true Law.\r\n\"Mobile super planum horizontale projectum mente concipio omni\r\nsecluso impedimento; jam constat ex his quæ fusius alibi dicta sunt,\r\nillius motum equabilem et perpetuum super ipso plano futurum esse,\r\nsi planum in infinitum extendatur.\" \"Conceive a movable body upon a\r\nhorizontal plane, and suppose all obstacles to motion to be removed;\r\nit is then manifest, from what has been said more at large in\r\nanother place, that the body's motion will be uniform and perpetual\r\nupon the plane, if the plane be indefinitely extended.\" His pupil\r\nBorelli, in 1667 (in the treatise _De Vi Percussionis_), states the\r\nproposition generally, that \"Velocity is, by its nature, uniform,\r\nand perpetual;\" and this opinion appears to have been, at that time,\r\ngenerally diffused, as we find evidence in Wallis and others. It is\r\ncommonly said that Descartes was the first to state this generally.\r\nHis _Principia_ were published in 1644; but his proofs of this First\r\nLaw of Motion are rather of a theological than of a mechanical kind.\r\nHis reason for this Law is,[9\\6] \"the immutability and simplicity of\r\nthe operation by which God preserves motion in matter. For he only\r\npreserves it precisely as it is in that moment in which he preserves\r\nit, taking no account of that which may have been previously.\"\r\nReasoning of this abstract and _à priori_ kind, though it may be\r\nurged in favor of true opinions after they have been inductively\r\nestablished, is almost equally capable of being called in on the\r\nside of error, as we have seen in the case of Aristotle's\r\nphilosophy. We ought not, however, to forget that the reference to\r\nthese abstract and _à priori_ principles is an indication of the\r\nabsolute universality and necessity which we look for in complete\r\nSciences, and a result of those faculties by which such Science is\r\nrendered possible, and suitable to man's intellectual nature.\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\6: Dial. **i. p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\6: **p. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\6: _Princip._ p. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe induction by which the First Law of Motion is established,\r\nconsists, as induction consists in all cases, in conceiving clearly\r\nthe Law, and in perceiving the subordination of Facts to it. But the\r\nLaw speaks of bodies not acted upon by any external force,--a case\r\nwhich never occurs in fact; and the difficulty of the step consisted\r\nin bringing all the common cases in which motion is gradually\r\nextinguished, under the notion of the action of a retarding force.\r\nIn order to do this, {324} Hooke and others showed that, by\r\ndiminishing the obvious resistances, the retardation also became\r\nless; and men were gradually led to a distinct appreciation of the\r\nResistance, Friction, &c., which, in all terrestrial motions,\r\nprevent the Law from being evident; and thus they at last\r\nestablished by experiment a Law which cannot be experimentally\r\nexemplified. The natural uniformity of motion was proved by\r\nexamining all kinds of cases in which motion was not uniform. Men\r\nculled the abstract Rule out of the concrete Experiment; although\r\nthe Rule was, in every case, mixed with other Rules, and each Rule\r\ncould be collected from the Experiment only by supposing the others\r\nknown. The perfect simplicity which we necessarily seek for in a law\r\nof nature, enables us to disentangle the complexity which this\r\ncombination appears at first sight to occasion.\r\n\r\nThe First Law of Motion asserts that the motion of a body, when left\r\nto itself will not only be uniform, but rectilinear also. This\r\nlatter part of the law is indeed obvious of itself as soon as we\r\nconceive a body detached from all special reference to external\r\npoints and objects. Yet, as we have seen, Galileo asserted that the\r\nnaturally uniform motion of bodies was that which takes place in a\r\ncircle. Benedetti, however, in 1585, had entertained sound notions\r\non this subject. In commenting on Aristotle's question, why we\r\nobtain an advantage in throwing by using a sling, he says,[10\\6] that\r\nthe body, when whirled round, tends to go on in a straight line. In\r\nGalileo's second Dialogue, he makes one of his interlocutors\r\n(Simplicio), when appealed to on this subject, after thinking\r\nintently for a little while, give the same opinion; and the\r\nprinciple is, from this time, taken for granted by the authors who\r\ntreat of the motion of projectiles. Descartes, as might be supposed,\r\ngives the same reason for this as for the other part of the law,\r\nnamely, the immutability of the Deity.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\6: \"Corpus vellet recta iter peragere.\"\r\n_**Speculationum Liber_, p. 160.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Formation and Application of the Notion of Accelerating\r\nForce.--Laws of Falling Bodies._\r\n\r\nWE have seen how rude and vague were the attempts of Aristotle and\r\nhis followers to obtain a philosophy of bodies falling downwards or\r\nthrown in any direction. If the First Law of Motion had been clearly\r\nknown, it would then, perhaps, have been seen that the way to\r\nunderstand and analyze the motion of any body, is to consider the\r\n{325} Causes of _change_ of motion which at each instant operate\r\nupon it; and thus men would have been led to the notion of\r\nAccelerating Forces, that is, Forces which act upon bodies already\r\nin motion, and accelerate, retard, or deflect their motions. It was,\r\nhowever, only after many attempts that they reached this point. They\r\nbegan by considering the _whole motion_ with reference to certain\r\nill-defined abstract Notions, instead of considering, with a clear\r\napprehension of the conditions of Causation, the _successive parts_\r\nof which the motion consists. Thus, they spoke of the tendency of\r\nbodies to the Centre, or to their Own Place;--of Projecting Force,\r\nof Impetus, of Retraction;--with little or no profit to knowledge.\r\nThe indistinctness of their notions may, perhaps, be judged of from\r\ntheir speculations concerning projectiles. Santbach,[11\\6] in 1561,\r\nimagined that a body thrown with great velocity, as, for instance, a\r\nball from a cannon, went in a straight line till all its velocity\r\nwas exhausted, and then fell directly downwards. He has written a\r\ntreatise on gunnery, founded on this absurd assumption. To this\r\nsucceeded another doctrine, which, though not much more\r\nphilosophical than the former, agreed much better with the\r\nphenomena. Nicolo Tartalea (_Nuova Scienza_, Venice, 1550; _Quesiti\r\net Inventioni Diversi_, 1554) and **Gualter Rivius (_Architectura_,\r\n&c., Basil, 1582) represented the path of a cannon-ball as\r\nconsisting, first of a straight line in the direction of the\r\noriginal projection, then of an arc of a circle in which it went on\r\ntill its motion became vertical downwards, and then of a vertical\r\nline in which it continued to fall. The latter of these writers,\r\nhowever, was aware that the path must, from the first, be a curve;\r\nand treated it as a straight line, only because the curvature is\r\nvery slight. Even Santbach's figure represents the path of the ball\r\nas partially descending before its final fall, but then it descends\r\nby _steps_, not in a curve. Santbach, therefore, did not conceive\r\nthe _Composition_ of the effect of gravity with the existing motion,\r\nbut supposed them to act alternately; Rivius, however, understood\r\nthis Composition, and saw that gravity must act as a deflecting\r\nforce at every point of the path. Galileo, in his second\r\nDialogue,[12\\6] makes Simplicius come to the same conclusion.\r\n\"Since,\" he says, \"there is nothing to support the body, when it\r\nquits that which projects it, it cannot be but that its proper\r\ngravity must operate,\" and it must immediately begin to decline\r\ndownwards. {326}\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\6: _Problematum Astronomicorum et Geometricorum Sectiones_\r\nvii. &c. &c. Auctore Daniele Santbach, Noviomago. Basileæ, 1561.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\6: P. 147.]\r\n\r\nThe Force of Gravity which thus produces deflection and curvature in\r\nthe path of a body thrown _obliquely_, constantly increases the\r\nvelocity of a body when it falls _vertically_ downwards. The\r\nuniversality of this increase was obvious, both from reasoning and in\r\nfact; the law of it could only be discovered by closer consideration;\r\nand the full analysis of the problem required a distinct measure of\r\nthe quantity of Accelerating Force. Galileo, who first solved this\r\nproblem, began by viewing it as a question of fact, but conjectured\r\nthe solution by taking for granted that the rule must be the simplest\r\npossible. \"Bodies,\" he says,[13\\6] \"will fall in the most simple way,\r\nbecause Natural Motions are always the most simple. When a stone\r\nfalls, if we consider the matter attentively, we shall find that there\r\nis no addition, no increase, of the velocity more simple than that\r\nwhich is always added in the same manner,\" that is, when equal\r\nadditions take place in equal times; \"which we shall easily understand\r\nif we attend to the close connection of motion and time.\" From this\r\nLaw, thus assumed, he deduced that the spaces described from the\r\nbeginning of the motion must be as the squares of the times; and,\r\nagain, assuming that the laws of descent for balls rolling down\r\ninclined planes, must be the same as for bodies falling freely, he\r\nverified this conclusion by experiment.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\6: _Dial. Sc._ iv. p. 91.]\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, occur to the reader that this argument, from the\r\nsimplicity of the assumed law, is somewhat insecure. It is not\r\nalways easy for us to discern what that greatest simplicity is,\r\nwhich nature adopts in her laws. Accordingly, Galileo was led wrong\r\nby this way of viewing the subject before he was led right. He at\r\nfirst supposed, that the Velocity which the body had acquired at any\r\npoint must be proportional to the _Space_ described from the point\r\nwhere the motion began. This false law is as simple in its\r\nenunciation as the true law, that the Velocity is proportional to\r\nthe _Time_: it had been asserted as the true law by M. Varro (_De\r\nMotu Tractatus_, Genevæ, 1584), and by Baliani, a gentleman of\r\nGenoa, who published it in 1638. It was, however, soon rejected by\r\nGalileo, though it was afterwards taken up and defended by Casræus,\r\none of Galileo's opponents. It so happens, indeed, that the false\r\nlaw is not only at variance with fact, but with itself: it involves\r\na mathematical self-contradiction. This circumstance, however, was\r\naccidental: it would be easy to state laws of the increase of\r\nvelocity which should be simple, and yet false in fact, though quite\r\npossible in their own nature. {327}\r\n\r\nThe Law of Velocity was hitherto, as we have seen, treated as a law\r\nof phenomena, without reference to the Causes of the law. \"The cause\r\nof the acceleration of the motions of falling bodies is not,\"\r\nGalileo observes, \"a necessary part of the investigation. Opinions\r\nare different. Some refer it to the approach to the centre; others\r\nsay that there is a certain extension of the centrical medium,\r\nwhich, closing behind the body, pushes it forwards. For the present,\r\nit is enough for us to demonstrate certain properties of Accelerated\r\nMotion, the acceleration being according to the very simple Law,\r\nthat the Velocity is proportional to the Time. And if we find that\r\nthe properties of such motion are verified by the motions of bodies\r\ndescending freely, we may suppose that the assumption agrees with\r\nthe laws of bodies falling freely by the action of gravity.\"[14\\6]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\6: Gal. _Op._ iii. 91, 92.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, an easy step to conceive this acceleration as\r\ncaused by the continual action of Gravity. This account had already\r\nbeen given by Benedetti, as we have seen. When it was once adopted,\r\nGravity was considered as a _constant_ or _uniform_ force; on this\r\npoint, indeed, the adherents of the law of Galileo and of that of\r\nCasræus were agreed; but the question was, what _is_ a Uniform\r\nForce? The answer which Galileo was led to give was obviously\r\nthis;--_that_ is a Uniform Force which generates equal velocities in\r\nequal successive times; and this principle leads at once to the\r\ndoctrine, that Forces are to be compared by comparing the Velocities\r\ngenerated by them in equal times.\r\n\r\nThough, however, this was a consequence of the rule by which Gravity\r\nis represented as a Uniform Force, the subject presents some\r\ndifficulty at first sight. It is not immediately obvious that we may\r\nthus measure forces by the Velocity _added_ in a given time, without\r\ntaking into account the velocity they have already. If we\r\ncommunicate velocity to a body by the hand or by a spring, the\r\neffect we produce in a second of time is lessened, when the body has\r\nalready a velocity which withdraws it from the pressure of the\r\nagent. But it appears that this is not so in the case of gravity;\r\nthe velocity added in one second is the same, whatever downward\r\nmotion the body already possesses. A body falling from rest acquires\r\na velocity, in one second, of thirty-two feet; and if a cannon-ball\r\nwere shot downwards with a velocity of 1000 feet a second, it would\r\nequally, at the end of one second, have received an accession of 32\r\nfeet to its velocity.\r\n\r\nThis conception of Gravity as a Uniform Force,--as constantly and\r\n{328} equally _increasing_ the velocity of a descending body,--will\r\nbecome clear by a little attention; but it undoubtedly presents\r\ndifficulty at first. Accordingly, we find that Descartes did not\r\naccept it. \"It is certain,\" he says, \"that a stone is not equally\r\ndisposed to receive a new motion or increase of velocity when it is\r\nalready moving very quickly, and when it is moving slowly.\"\r\n\r\nDescartes showed, by other expressions, that he had not caught hold\r\nof the true notion of accelerating force. Thus, he says in a letter\r\nto Mersenne, \"I am astonished at what you tell me, of having found,\r\nby experiment, that bodies thrown up in the air take neither more\r\nnor less time to rise than to fall again; and you will excuse me if\r\nI say that I look upon the experiment as a very difficult one to\r\nmake accurately.\" Yet it is clear from the Notion of a Constant\r\nForce that (omitting the resistance of the air) this equality must\r\ntake place; for the Force which will gradually destroy the whole\r\nvelocity in a certain time in ascending, will, in the same time,\r\ngenerate again the same velocity by the same gradations inverted;\r\nand therefore the same space will be passed over in the same time in\r\nthe descent and in the ascent.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty arose from a necessary consequence of the Laws of\r\nFalling Bodies thus established;--the proposition, namely, that in\r\nacquiring its motion, a body passes through every intermediate degree\r\nof velocity, from the smallest conceivable, up to that which it at\r\nlast acquires. When a body falls from rest, it begins to fall with\r\n_no_ velocity; the velocity increases with the time; and in\r\none-thousandth part of a second, the body has only acquired\r\none-thousandth part of the velocity which it has at the end of one\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThis is certain, and manifest on consideration; yet there was at first\r\nmuch difficulty raised on the subject of this assertion; and disputes\r\ntook place concerning the velocity with which a body _begins_ to fall.\r\nOn this subject also Descartes did not form clear notions. He writes\r\nto a correspondent, \"I have been revising my notes on Galileo, in\r\nwhich I have not said expressly that falling bodies do not pass\r\nthrough every degree of slowness, but I said that this cannot be known\r\nwithout knowing what Weight is, which comes to the same thing; as to\r\nyour example, I grant that it proves that every degree of velocity is\r\ninfinitely divisible, but not that a falling body actually passes\r\nthrough all these divisions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Principles of the Motion of Falling Bodies being thus established\r\nby Galileo, the Deduction of the principal mathematical consequences\r\nwas, as is usual, effected with great rapidity, and is to be found\r\n{329} in his works, and in those of his scholars and successors. The\r\nmotion of bodies falling freely was, however, in such treatises,\r\ngenerally combined with the motion of bodies Falling along Inclined\r\nPlanes; a part of the theory of which we have still to speak.\r\n\r\nThe Notion of Accelerating Force and of its operation, once formed,\r\nwas naturally applied in other cases than that of bodies falling\r\nfreely. The different velocities with which heavy and light bodies\r\nfall were explained by the different resistance of the air, which\r\ndiminishes the accelerating force;[15\\6] and it was boldly asserted,\r\nthat in a vacuum a lock of wool and a piece of lead would fall equally\r\nquickly. It was also maintained[16\\6] that any falling body, however\r\nlarge and heavy, would always have its velocity in some degree\r\ndiminished by the air in which it falls, and would at last be reduced\r\nto a state of uniform motion, as soon as the resistance upwards became\r\nequal to the accelerating force downwards. Though the law of progress\r\nof a body to this limiting velocity was not made out till the\r\n_Principia_ of Newton appeared, the views on which Galileo made this\r\nassertion are perfectly sound, and show that he had clearly conceived\r\nthe nature and operation of accelerating and retarding force.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\6: Galileo, iii. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\6: iii. 54.]\r\n\r\nWhen Uniform Accelerating Forces had once been mastered, there\r\nremained only mathematical difficulties in the treatment of Variable\r\nForces. A Variable Force was measured by the _Limit_ of the\r\nincrement of the Velocity, compared with the increment of the Time;\r\njust as a Variable Velocity was measured by the Limit of the\r\nincrement of the Space compared with that of the Time.\r\n\r\nWith this introduction of the Notion of Limits, we are, of course, led\r\nto the Higher Geometry, either in its geometrical or its analytical\r\nform. The general laws of bodies falling by the action of any Variable\r\nForces were given by Newton in the Seventh Section of the _Principia_.\r\nThe subject is there, according to Newton's preference of geometrical\r\nmethods, treated by means of the Quadrature of Curves; the Doctrine of\r\nLimits being exhibited in a peculiar manner in the First Section of\r\nthe work, in order to prepare the way for such applications of it.\r\nLeibnitz, the Bernouillis, Euler, and since their time, many other\r\nmathematicians, have treated such questions by means of the analytical\r\nmethod of limits, the Differential Calculus. The Rectilinear Motion of\r\nbodies acted upon by variable forces is, of course, a simpler problem\r\nthan their Curvilinear Motion, to which we have now to proceed. But it\r\n{330} may be remarked that Newton, having established the laws of\r\nCurvilinear Motion independently, has, in a great part of his Seventh\r\nSection, deduced the simpler case of the Rectilinear Motion from the\r\nmove complex problem, by reasonings of great ingenuity and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Establishment of the Second Law of Motion.--Curvilinear\r\nMotions._\r\n\r\nA SLIGHT degree of distinctness in men's mechanical notions enabled\r\nthem to perceive, as we have already explained, that a body which\r\ntraces a curved line must be urged by some force, by which it is\r\nconstantly made to deviate from that rectilinear path, which it\r\nwould pursue if acted upon by no force. Thus, when a body is made to\r\ndescribe a circle, as when a stone is whirled round in a sling, we\r\nfind that the string does exert such a force on the stone; for the\r\nstring is stretched by the effort, and if it be too slender, it may\r\nthus be broken. This _centrifugal force_ of bodies moving in circles\r\nwas noticed even by the ancients. The effect of force to produce\r\ncurvilinear motion also appears in the paths described by\r\nprojectiles. We have already seen that though Tartalea did not\r\nperceive this correctly, Rivius, about the same time, did.\r\n\r\nTo see that a transverse force would produce a curve, was one step;\r\nto determine what the curve is, was another step, which involved the\r\ndiscovery of the Second Law of Motion. This step was made by\r\nGalileo. In his _Dialogues on Motion_, he asserts that a body\r\nprojected horizontally will retain a uniform motion in the\r\nhorizontal direction, and will have, compounded with this, a\r\nuniformly accelerated motion downwards, that is, the motion of a\r\nbody falling vertically from rest; and will thus describe the curve\r\ncalled a parabola.\r\n\r\nThe Second Law of Motion consists of this assertion in a general\r\nform;--namely, that in all cases the motion which the force will\r\nproduce is compounded with the motion which the body previously has.\r\nThis was not obvious; for Cardan had maintained,[17\\6] that \"if a\r\nbody is moved by two motions at once, it will come to the place\r\nresulting from their composition slower than by either of them.\" The\r\nproof of the truth of the law to Galileo's mind was, so far as we\r\ncollect from the Dialogue itself, the simplicity of the supposition,\r\nand his clear perception of the causes which, in some cases,\r\nproduced an obvious deviation in practice {331} from this\r\ntheoretical result. For it may be observed, that the curvilinear\r\npaths ascribed to military projectiles by Rivius and Tartalea, and\r\nby other writers who followed them, as Digges and Norton in our own\r\ncountry, though utterly different from the theoretical form, the\r\nparabola, do, in fact, approach nearer the true paths of a cannon or\r\nmusket ball than a parabola would do; and this approximation more\r\nespecially exists in that which at first sight appears most absurd\r\nin the old theory; namely, the assertion that the ball, which\r\nascends in a sloping direction, finally descends vertically. In\r\nconsequence of the resistance of the air, this is really the path of\r\na projectile; and when the velocity is very great, as in military\r\nprojectiles, the deviation from the parabolic form is very manifest.\r\nThis cause of discrepancy between the theory, which does not take\r\nresistance into the account, and the fact, Galileo perceived; and\r\naccordingly he says,[18\\6] that the velocities of the projectiles,\r\nin such cases, may be considered as excessive and supernatural. With\r\nthe due allowance to such causes, he maintained that his theory was\r\nverified, and might be applied in practice. Such practical\r\napplications of the doctrine of projectiles no doubt had a share in\r\nestablishing the truth of Galileo's views. We must not forget,\r\nhowever, that the full establishment of this second law of motion\r\nwas the result of the theoretical and experimental discussions\r\nconcerning the motion of the earth: its fortunes were involved in\r\nthose of the Copernican system; and it shared the triumph of that\r\ndoctrine. This triumph was already decisive, indeed, in the time of\r\nGalileo, but not complete till the time of Newton.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\6: _Op._ vol. iv. p. 490.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\6: _Op._ vol. iii. p. 147.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Generalization of the Laws of Equilibrium.--Principle\r\nof Virtual Velocities._\r\n\r\nIT was known, even as early as Aristotle, that the two weights which\r\nbalance each other on the lever, if they move at all, move with\r\nvelocities which are in the inverse proportions of the weights. The\r\npeculiar resources of the Greek language, which could state this\r\nrelation of inverse proportionality in a single word (ἀντιπέπονθεν),\r\nfixed it in men's minds, and prompted them to generalize from this\r\nproperty. Such attempts were at first made with indistinct ideas,\r\nand on conjecture only, and had, therefore, no scientific value.\r\nThis is the judgment which we must pass on the book of Jordanus\r\nNemorarius, which {332} we have already mentioned. Its reasonings\r\nare professedly on Aristotelian principles, and exhibit the common\r\nAristotelian absence of all distinct mechanical ideas. But in Varro,\r\nwhose _Tractatus de Motu_ appeared in 1584, we find the principle,\r\nin a general form, not satisfactorily proved, indeed, but much more\r\ndistinctly conceived. This is his first theorem: \"Duarum virium\r\nconnexarum quarum (si moveantur) motus erunt ipsis ἀντιπεπονθῶς\r\nproportionales, neutra alteram movebit, sed equilibrium facient.\"\r\nThe proof offered of this is, that the resistance to a force is as\r\nthe motion produced; and, as we have seen, the theorem is rightly\r\napplied in the example of the wedge. From this time it appears to\r\nhave been usual to prove the properties of machines by means of this\r\nprinciple. This is done, for instance, in _Les Raisons des Forces\r\nMouvantes_, the production of Solomon de Caus, engineer to the\r\nElector Palatine, published at Antwerp in 1616; in which the effect\r\nof Toothed-Wheels and of the Screw is determined in this manner, but\r\nthe Inclined Plane is not treated of. The same is the case in Bishop\r\nWilkins's _Mathematical Magic_, in 1648.\r\n\r\nWhen the true doctrine of the Inclined Plane had been established,\r\nthe laws of equilibrium for all the simple machines or Mechanical\r\nPowers, as they had usually been enumerated in books on Mechanics,\r\nwere brought into view; for it was easy to see that the _Wedge_ and\r\nthe _Screw_ involved the same principle as the _Inclined Plane_, and\r\nthe _Pulley_ could obviously be reduced to the _Lever_. It was,\r\nalso, not difficult for a person with clear mechanical ideas to\r\nperceive how any other combination of bodies, on which pressure and\r\ntraction are exerted, may be reduced to these simple machines, so as\r\nto disclose the relation of the forces. Hence by the discovery of\r\nStevinus, all problems of equilibrium were essentially solved.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural generalization of the property of the lever, which\r\nwe have just mentioned, enabled mathematicians to express the\r\nsolution of all these problems by means of one proposition. This was\r\ndone by saying, that in raising a weight by any machine, we _lose_\r\nin Time what we _gain_ in Force; the weight raised moves as much\r\n_slower_ than the power, as it is _larger_ than the power. This was\r\nexplained with great clearness by Galileo, in the preface to his\r\n_Treatise on Mechanical Science_, published in 1592.\r\n\r\nThe motions, however, which we here suppose the parts of the machine\r\nto have, are not motions which the forces produce; for at present we\r\nare dealing with the case in which the forces balance each other,\r\nand therefore produce no motion. But we ascribe to the {333} Weights\r\nand Powers hypothetical motions, arising from some other cause; and\r\nthen, by the construction of the machine, the velocities of the\r\nWeights and Powers must have certain definite ratios. These\r\nvelocities, being thus hypothetically supposed and not actually\r\nproduced, are called _Virtual_ Velocities. And the general law of\r\nequilibrium is, that in any machine, the Weights which balance each\r\nother, are reciprocally to each other as their Virtual Velocities.\r\nThis is called the _Principle of Virtual Velocities_.\r\n\r\nThis Principle (which was afterwards still further generalized) is,\r\nby some of the admirers of Galileo, dwelt upon as one of his great\r\nservices to Mechanics. But if we examine it more nearly, we shall\r\nsee that it has not much importance in our history. It is a\r\ngeneralization, but a generalization established rather by\r\nenumeration of cases, than by any induction proceeding upon one\r\ndistinct Idea, like those generalizations of Facts by which Laws are\r\nprimarily established. It rather serves verbally to conjoin Laws\r\npreviously known, than to exhibit a connection in them: it is rather\r\na help for the memory than a proof for the reason.\r\n\r\nThe Principle of Virtual Velocities is so far from implying any\r\nclear possession of mechanical ideas, that any one who knows the\r\nproperty of the Lever, whether he is capable of seeing the reason\r\nfor it or not, can see that the greater weight moves slower in the\r\nexact proportion of its greater magnitude. Accordingly, Aristotle,\r\nwhose entire want of sound mechanical views we have shown, has yet\r\nnoticed this truth. When Galileo treats of it, instead of offering\r\nany reasons which could independently establish this principle, he\r\ngives his readers a number of analogies and illustrations, many of\r\nthem very loose ones. Thus the raising a great weight by a small\r\nforce, he illustrates by supposing the weight broken into many small\r\nparts, and conceiving those parts raised one by one. By other\r\npersons, the analogy, already intimated, of gain and loss is\r\nreferred to as an argument for the principle in question. Such\r\nimages may please the fancy, but they cannot be accepted as\r\nmechanical reasons.\r\n\r\nSince Galileo neither first enunciated this rule, nor ever proved it\r\nas an independent principle of Mechanics, we cannot consider the\r\ndiscovery of it as one of his mechanical achievements. Still less\r\ncan we compare his reference to this principle with Stevinus's proof\r\nof the Inclined Plane; which, as we have seen, was rigorously\r\ninferred from the sound axiom, that a body cannot put itself in\r\nmotion. If we were to assent to the really self-evident axioms of\r\nStevinus, only in virtue {334} of the unproved verbal generalization\r\nof Galileo, we should be in great danger of allowing ourselves to be\r\nreferred successively from one truth to another, without any\r\nreasonable hope of ever arriving at any thing ultimate and\r\nfundamental.\r\n\r\nBut though this Principle of Virtual Velocity cannot be looked upon\r\nas a great discovery of Galileo, it is a highly useful rule; and the\r\nvarious forms under which he and his successors urged it, tended\r\nmuch to dissipate the vague wonder with which the effects of\r\nmachines had been looked upon; and thus to diffuse sounder and\r\nclearer notions on such subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Principle of Virtual Velocities also affected the progress of\r\nmechanical science in another way: it suggested some of the\r\nanalogies by the aid of which the Third Law of Motion was made out;\r\nleading to the adoption of the notion of _Momentum_ as the\r\narithmetical product of weight and velocity. Since on a machine on\r\nwhich a weight of two pounds at one part balances three pounds at\r\nanother part, the former weight would move through three inches\r\nwhile the latter would move through two inches; we see (since three\r\nmultiplied into two is equal to two multiplied into three) that the\r\n_Product_ of the weight and the velocity is the same for the two\r\nbalancing weights; and if we call this Product _Momentum_, the Law\r\nof Equilibrium is, that when two weights balance on a machine, the\r\nMomentum of the two would be the same, if they were put in motion.\r\n\r\nThe Notion of Momentum was here employed in connection with Virtual\r\nVelocities; but it also came under consideration in treating of\r\nActual Velocities, as we shall soon see.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Attempts at the Third Law of Motion.--Notion of\r\nMomentum._\r\n\r\nIN the questions we have hitherto had to consider respecting Motion,\r\nno regard is had to the Size of the body moved, but only to the\r\nVelocity and Direction of the motion. We must now trace the progress\r\nof knowledge respecting the mode in which the Mass of the body\r\ninfluences the effect of Force. This is a more difficult and complex\r\nbranch of the subject; but it is one which requires to be noticed,\r\nas obviously as the former. Questions belonging to this department\r\nof Mechanics, as well as to the others, occur in Aristotle's\r\nMechanical Problems. \"Why,\" says he, \"is it, that neither very small\r\nnor very large bodies go far when we throw them; but, in order that\r\nthis may {335} happen, the thing thrown must have a certain\r\nproportion to the agent which throws it? Is it that what is thrown\r\nor pushed must react[19\\6] against that which pushes it; and that a\r\nbody so large as not to yield at all, or so small as to yield\r\nentirely, and not to react, produces no throw or push?\" The same\r\nconfusion of ideas prevailed after his time; and mechanical\r\nquestions were in vain discussed by means of general and abstract\r\nterms, employed with no distinct and steady meaning; such as\r\n_impetus_, _power_, _momentum_, _virtue_, _energy_, and the like.\r\nFrom some of these speculations we may judge how thorough the\r\nconfusion in men's heads had become. Cardan perplexes himself with\r\nthe difficulty, already mentioned, of the comparison of the forces\r\nof bodies at rest and in motion. If the Force of a body depends on\r\nits velocity, as it appears to do, how is it that a body at rest has\r\nany Force at all, and how can it resist the slightest effort, or\r\nexert any pressure? He flatters himself that he solves the question,\r\nby asserting that bodies at rest have an occult motion. \"Corpus\r\nmovetur occulto motu quiescendo.\"--Another puzzle, with which he\r\nappears to distress himself rather more wantonly, is this: \"If one\r\nman can draw half of a certain weight, and another man also one\r\nhalf; when the two act together, these proportions should be\r\ncompounded; so that they ought to be able to draw one half of one\r\nhalf, or one quarter only.\" The talent which ingenious men had for\r\ngetting into such perplexities, was certainly at one time very\r\ngreat. Arriaga,[20\\6] who wrote in 1639, is troubled to discover how\r\nseveral flat weights, lying one upon another on a board, should\r\nproduce a greater pressure than the lowest one alone produces, since\r\nthat alone touches the board. Among other solutions, he suggests\r\nthat the board affects the upper weight, which it does not touch, by\r\ndetermining its _ubication_, or _whereness_.\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\6: ἀντερείδειν.]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\6: Rod. de Arriaga, _Cursus Philosophicus_. Paris, 1639.]\r\n\r\nAristotle's doctrine, that a body ten times as heavy as another,\r\nwill fall ten times as fast, is another instance of the confusion of\r\nStatical and Dynamical Forces: the Force of the greater body, while\r\n_at rest_, is ten times as great as that of the other; but the Force\r\nas measured by the _velocity_ produced, is equal in the two cases.\r\nThe two bodies would fall downwards with the same rapidity, except\r\nso far as they are affected by accidental causes. The merit of\r\nproving this by experiment, and thus refuting the Aristotelian\r\ndogma, is usually ascribed to Galileo, who made his experiment from\r\nthe famous leaning tower of Pisa, about 1590. But others about the\r\nsame time had not {336} overlooked so obvious a fact--F.\r\nPiccolomini, in his _Liber Scientiæ de Natura_, published at Padua,\r\nin 1597, says, \"On the subject of the motion of heavy and light\r\nbodies, Aristotle has put forth various opinions, which are contrary\r\nto sense and experience, and has delivered rules concerning the\r\nproportion of quickness and slowness, which are palpably false. For\r\na stone twice as great does _not_ move twice as fast.\" And Stevinus,\r\nin the Appendix to his Statics, describes his having made the\r\nexperiment, and speaks with great correctness of the apparent\r\ndeviations from the rule, arising from the resistance of the air.\r\nIndeed, the result followed by very obvious reasoning; for ten\r\nbricks, in contact with each other, side by side, would obviously\r\nfall in the same time as one; and these might be conceived to form a\r\nbody ten times as large as one of them. Accordingly, Benedetti, in\r\n1585, reasons in this manner with regard to bodies of different\r\nsize, though he retains Aristotle's error as to the different\r\nvelocity of bodies of different density.\r\n\r\nThe next step in this subject is more clearly due to Galileo; he\r\ndiscovered the true proportion which the Accelerating Force of a\r\nbody falling down an inclined plane bears to the Accelerating Force\r\nof the same body falling freely. This was at first a happy\r\nconjecture; it was then confirmed by experiments, and, finally,\r\nafter some hesitation, it was referred to its true principle, the\r\nThird Law of Motion, with proper elementary simplicity. The\r\nPrinciple here spoken of is this:--that for the same body, the\r\nDynamical effect of force is as the Statical effect; that is, the\r\nVelocity which any force generates in a given time when it puts the\r\nbody in motion, is proportional to the Pressure which the same force\r\nproduces in a body at rest. The Principle, so stated, appears very\r\nsimple and obvious; yet this was not the form in which it suggested\r\nitself either to Galileo or to other persons who sought to prove it.\r\nGalileo, in his _Dialogues on Motion_, assumes, as his fundamental\r\nproposition on this subject, one much less evident than that we have\r\nquoted, but one in which that is involved. His Postulate is,[21\\6]\r\nthat when the same body falls down different planes of the same\r\nheight, the velocities acquired are equal. He confirms and\r\nillustrates this by a very ingenious experiment on a pendulum,\r\nshowing that the weight swings to the same height whatever path it\r\nbe compelled to follow. Torricelli, in his treatise published 1644,\r\nsays that he had heard that Galileo had, towards the end of his\r\nlife, proved his {337} assumption, but that, not having seen the\r\nproof, he will give his own. In this he refers us to the right\r\nprinciple, but appears not distinctly to conceive the proof, since\r\nhe estimates _momentum_ indiscriminately by the statical Pressure of\r\na body, and by its Velocity when in motion; as if these two\r\nquantities were self-evidently equal. Huyghens, in 1673, expresses\r\nhimself dissatisfied with the proof by which Galileo's assumption\r\nwas supported in the later editions of his works. His own proof\r\nrests on this principle;--that if a body fall down one inclined\r\nplane, and proceed up another with the velocity thus acquired, it\r\ncannot, under any circumstances, ascend to a higher position than\r\nthat from which it fell. This principle coincides very nearly with\r\nGalileo's experimental illustration. In truth, however, Galileo's\r\nprinciple, which Huyghens thus slights, may be looked upon as a\r\nsatisfactory statement of the true law  namely, that, in the same\r\nbody, the velocity produced is as the pressure which produces it.\r\n\"We are agreed,\" he says,[22\\6] \"that, in a movable body, the\r\n_impetus_, _energy_, _momentum_, or _propension to motion_, is as\r\ngreat as is the _force_ or _least resistance_ which suffices to\r\n_support_ it.\" The various terms here used, both for dynamical and\r\nstatical Force, show that Galileo's ideas were not confused by the\r\nambiguity of any one term, as appears to have happened to some\r\nmathematicians. The principle thus announced, is, as we shall see,\r\none of great extent and value; and we read with interest the\r\ncircumstances of its discovery, which are thus narrated.[23\\6] When\r\nViviani was studying with Galileo, he expressed his dissatisfaction\r\nat the want of any clear reason for Galileo's postulate respecting\r\nthe equality of velocities acquired down inclined planes of the same\r\nheights; the consequence of which was, that Galileo, as he lay, the\r\nsame night, sleepless through indisposition, discovered the proof\r\nwhich he had long sought in vain, and introduced it in the\r\nsubsequent editions. It is easy to see, by looking at the proof,\r\nthat the discoverer had had to struggle, not for intermediate steps\r\nof reasoning between remote notions, as in a problem of geometry,\r\nbut for a clear possession of ideas which were near each other, and\r\nwhich he had not yet been able to bring into contact, because he had\r\nnot yet a sufficiently firm grasp of them. Such terms as Momentum\r\nand Force had been sources of confusion from the time of Aristotle;\r\nand it required considerable steadiness of thought to compare the\r\nforces of bodies at rest and in motion under the obscurity and\r\nvacillation thus produced. {338}\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\6: _Opere_, iii. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\6: Galileo, _Op._ iii. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\6: Drinkwater, _Life of Galileo_, p. 59.]\r\n\r\nThe term _Momentum_ had been introduced to express the force of\r\nbodies in motion, before it was known what that effect was. Galileo,\r\nin his _Discorso intorno alle Cose che stanno in su l' Acqua_, says,\r\nthat \"Momentum is the force, efficacy, or virtue, with which the\r\nmotion moves and the body moved resists, depending not upon weight\r\nonly, but upon the velocity, inclination, and any other cause of\r\nsuch virtue.\" When he arrived at more precision in his views, he\r\ndetermined, as we have seen, that, in the same body, the Momentum is\r\n_proportional_ to the Velocity; and, hence it was easily seen that\r\nin different bodies it was proportional to the Velocity and Mass\r\njointly. The principle thus enunciated is capable of very extensive\r\napplication, and, among other consequences, leads to a determination\r\nof the results of the mutual Percussion of Bodies. But though\r\nGalileo, like others of his predecessors and contemporaries, had\r\nspeculated concerning the problem of Percussion, he did not arrive\r\nat any satisfactory conclusion; and the problem remained for the\r\nmathematicians of the next generation to solve.\r\n\r\nWe may here notice Descartes and his Laws of Motion, the publication\r\nof which is sometimes spoken of as an important event in the history\r\nof Mechanics. This is saying far too much. The _Principia_ of\r\nDescartes did little for physical science. His assertion of the Laws\r\nof Motion, in their most general shape, was perhaps an improvement\r\nin form; but his Third Law is false in substance. Descartes claimed\r\nseveral of the discoveries of Galileo and others of his\r\ncontemporaries; but we cannot assent to such claims, when we find\r\nthat, as we shall see, he did not understand, or would not apply,\r\nthe Laws of Motion when he had them before him. If we were to\r\ncompare Descartes with Galileo, we might say, that of the mechanical\r\ntruths which were easily attainable in the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, Galileo took hold of as many, and Descartes of\r\nas few, as was well possible for a man of genius.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [The following remarks of M. Libri appear to be just. After\r\ngiving an account of the doctrines put forth on the subject of\r\nAstronomy, Mechanics, and other branches of science, by Leonardo da\r\nVinci, Fracastoro, Maurolycus, Commandinus, Benedetti, he adds\r\n(_Hist. des Sciences Mathématiques en Italie_, t. iii. p. 131):\r\n\"This short analysis is sufficient to show that, at the period at\r\nwhich we are arrived, Aristotle no longer reigned unquestioned in\r\nthe Italian Schools. If we had to write the history of philosophy,\r\nwe should prove by a multitude of facts that it was the Italians who\r\noverthrew the ancient idol of philosophers. Men go on incessantly\r\nrepeating that the {339} struggle was begun by Descartes, and they\r\nproclaim him the legislator of modern philosophers. But when we\r\nexamine the philosophical writings of Fracastoro, of Benedetti, of\r\nCardan, and above all, those of Galileo; when we see on all sides\r\nenergetic protests raised against the peripatetic doctrines; we ask,\r\nwhat there remained for the inventor of vortices to do, in\r\noverturning the natural philosophy of Aristotle? In addition to\r\nthis, the memorable labors of the School of Cosenza, of Telesius, of\r\nGiordano Bruno, of Campanella; the writings of Patricius, who was,\r\nbesides, a good geometer; of Nizolius, whom Leibnitz esteemed so\r\nhighly, and of the other metaphysicians of the same epoch,--prove\r\nthat the ancient philosophy had already lost its empire on that side\r\nthe Alps, when Descartes threw himself upon the enemy now put to the\r\nrout. The yoke was cast off in Italy, and all Europe had only to\r\nfollow the example, without its being necessary to give a new\r\nimpulse to real science.\"\r\n\r\nIn England, we are accustomed to hear Francis Bacon, rather than\r\nDescartes, spoken of as the first great antagonist of the\r\nAristotelian schools, and the legislator of modern philosophy. But\r\nit is true, both of one and the other, that the overthrow of the\r\nancient system had been effectively begun before their time by the\r\npractical discoverers here mentioned, and others who, by experiment\r\nand reasoning, established truths inconsistent with the received\r\nAristotelian doctrines. Gilbert in England, Kepler in Germany, as\r\nwell as Benedetti and Galileo in Italy, gave a powerful impulse to\r\nthe cause of real knowledge, before the influence of Bacon and\r\nDescartes had produced any general effect. What Bacon really did was\r\nthis;--that by the august image which he presented of a future\r\nPhilosophy, the rival of the Aristotelian, and far more powerful and\r\nextensive, he drew to it the affections and hopes of all men of\r\ncomprehensive and vigorous minds, as well as of those who attended\r\nto special trains of discovery. He announced a New Method, not\r\nmerely a correction of special current errors; he thus converted the\r\nInsurrection into a Revolution, and established a new philosophical\r\nDynasty. Descartes had, in some degree, the same purpose; and, in\r\naddition to this, he not only proclaimed himself the author of a New\r\nMethod, but professed to give a complete system of the results of\r\nthe Method. His physical philosophy was put forth as complete and\r\ndemonstrative, and thus involved the vices of the ancient dogmatism.\r\nTelesius and Campanella had also grand notions of an entire reform\r\nin the method of philosophizing, as I have noticed in the\r\n_Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, Book xii.] {340}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  III.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE EPOCH OF GALILEO.--PERIOD OF VERIFICATION AND\r\nDEDUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE evidence on which Galileo rested the truth of the Laws of Motion\r\nwhich he asserted, was, as we have seen, the simplicity of the laws\r\nthemselves, and the agreement of their consequences with facts;\r\nproper allowances being made for disturbing causes. His successors\r\ntook up and continued the task of making repeated comparisons of the\r\ntheory with practice, till no doubt remained of the exactness of the\r\nfundamental doctrines: they also employed themselves in simplifying,\r\nas much as possible, the mode of stating these doctrines, and in\r\ntracing their consequences in various problems by the aid of\r\nmathematical reasoning. These employments led to the publication of\r\nvarious Treatises on Falling Bodies, Inclined Planes, Pendulums,\r\nProjectiles, Spouting Fluids, which occupied a great part of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe authors of these treatises may be considered as the School of\r\nGalileo. Several of them were, indeed, his pupils or personal\r\nfriends. Castelli was his disciple and astronomical assistant at\r\nFlorence, and afterwards his correspondent. Torricelli was at first\r\na pupil of Castelli, but became the inmate and amanuensis of Galileo\r\nin 1641, and succeeded him in his situation at the court of Florence\r\non his death, which took place a few months afterwards. Viviani\r\nformed one of his family during the three last years of his life;\r\nand surviving him and his contemporaries (for Viviani lived even\r\ninto the eighteenth century), has a manifest pleasure and pride in\r\ncalling himself the last of the disciples of Galileo. Gassendi, an\r\neminent French mathematician and professor, visited him in 1628; and\r\nit shows us the extent of his reputation when we find Milton\r\nreferring thus to his travels in Italy:[24\\6] \"There it was that I\r\nfound and visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner in the\r\nInquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan\r\nand Dominican licensers thought.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\6: _Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing._]\r\n\r\nBesides the above writers, we may mention, as persons who pursued and\r\nillustrated Galileo's doctrines, Borelli, who was professor at\r\nFlorence and Pisa; Mersenne, the correspondent of Descartes, who was\r\n{341} professor at Paris; Wallis, who was appointed Savilian professor\r\nat Oxford in 1649, his predecessor being ejected by the parliamentary\r\ncommissioners. It is not necessary for us to trace the progress of\r\npurely mathematical inventions, which constitute a great part of the\r\nworks of these authors; but a few circumstances may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe question of the proof of the Second Law of Motion was, from the\r\nfirst, identified with the controversy respecting the truth of the\r\nCopernican System; for this law supplied the true answer to the most\r\nformidable of the objections against the motion of the earth;\r\nnamely, that if the earth were moving, bodies which were dropt from\r\nan elevated object would be left behind by the place from which they\r\nfell. This argument was reproduced in various forms by the opponents\r\nof the new doctrine; and the answers to the argument, though they\r\nbelong to the history of Astronomy, and form part of the Sequel to\r\nthe Epoch of Copernicus, belong more peculiarly to the history of\r\nMechanics, and are events in the sequel to the Discoveries of\r\nGalileo. So far, indeed, as the mechanical controversy was\r\nconcerned, the advocates of the Second Law of Motion appealed, very\r\ntriumphantly, to experiment. Gassendi made many experiments on this\r\nsubject publicly, of which an account is given in his _Epistolæ tres\r\nde Motu Impresso a Motore Translato_[25\\6] It appeared in these\r\nexperiments, that bodies let fall downwards, or cast upwards,\r\nforwards, or backwards, from a ship, or chariot, or man, whether at\r\nrest, or in any degree of motion, had always the same motion\r\nrelatively to the _motor_. In the application of this principle to\r\nthe system of the world, indeed, Gassendi and other philosophers of\r\nhis time were greatly hampered; for the deference which religious\r\nscruples required, did not allow them to say that the earth really\r\nmoved, but only that the physical reasons against its motion were\r\ninvalid. This restriction enabled Riccioli and other writers on the\r\ngeocentric side to involve the subject in metaphysical difficulties;\r\nbut the conviction of men was not permanently shaken by these, and\r\nthe Second Law of Motion was soon assumed as unquestioned.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\6: Mont. ii. 199.]\r\n\r\nThe Laws of the Motion of Falling Bodies, as assigned by Galileo,\r\nwere confirmed by the reasonings of Gassendi and Fermat, and the\r\nexperiments of Riccioli and Grimaldi; and the effect of resistance\r\nwas pointed out by **Mersenne and Dechales. The parabolic motion of\r\nProjectiles was more especially illustrated by experiments on the\r\njet which spouts from an orifice in a vessel full of fluid. This\r\nmode of experimenting {342} is well adapted to attract notice, since\r\nthe curve described, which is transient and invisible in the case of\r\na single projectile, becomes permanent and visible when we have a\r\ncontinuous stream. The doctrine of the motions of fluids has always\r\nbeen zealously cultivated by the Italians. Castelli's treatise,\r\n_Della Misura dell' Acque Corrente_ (1638), is the first work on\r\nthis subject, and Montucla with justice calls him \"the creator of a\r\nnew branch of hydraulics;\"[26\\6] although he mistakenly supposed the\r\nvelocity of efflux to be as the depth of the orifice from the\r\nsurface. **Mersenne and Torricelli also pursued this subject, and\r\nafter them, many others.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\6: Mont. ii. 201.]\r\n\r\nGalileo's belief in the near approximation of the curve described by\r\na cannon-ball or musket-ball to the theoretical parabola, was\r\nsomewhat too obsequiously adopted by succeeding practical writers on\r\nartillery. They underrated, as he had done, the effect of the\r\nresistance of the air, which is in effect so great as entirely to\r\nchange the form and properties of the curve. Notwithstanding this,\r\nthe parabolic theory was employed, as in Anderson's _Art of Gunnery_\r\n(1674); and Blondel, in his _Art de jeter les Bombes_ (1688), not\r\nonly calculated Tables on this supposition, but attempted to answer\r\nthe objections which had been made respecting the form of the curve\r\ndescribed. It was not till a later period (1740), when Robins made a\r\nseries of careful and sagacious experiments on artillery, and when\r\nsome of the most eminent mathematicians calculated the curve, taking\r\ninto account the resistance, that the Theory of Projectiles could be\r\nsaid to be verified in fact.\r\n\r\nThe Third Law of Motion was still in some confusion when Galileo died,\r\nas we have seen. The next great step made in the school of Galileo was\r\nthe determination of the Laws of the motions of bodies in their Direct\r\nImpact, so far as this impact affects the motion of translation. The\r\ndifficulties of the problem of Percussion arose, in part, from the\r\nheterogeneous nature of Pressure (of a body at rest), and Momentum (of\r\na body in motion); and, in part, from mixing together the effects of\r\npercussion on the parts of a body, as, for instance, cutting,\r\nbruising, and breaking, with its effect in moving the whole.\r\n\r\nThe former difficulty had been seen with some clearness by Galileo\r\nhimself. In a posthumous addition to his _Mechanical Dialogues_, he\r\nsays, \"There are two kinds of resistance in a movable body, one\r\ninternal, as when we say it is more difficult to lift a weight of a\r\nthousand pounds than a weight of a hundred; another respecting\r\nspace, as {343} when we say that it requires more force to throw a\r\nstone one hundred paces than fifty.\"[27\\6] Reasoning upon this\r\ndifference, he comes to the conclusion that \"the Momentum of\r\npercussion is infinite, since there is no resistance, however great,\r\nwhich is not overcome by a force of percussion, however\r\nsmall.\"[28\\6] He further explains this by observing that the\r\nresistance to percussion must occupy some portion of time, although\r\nthis portion may be insensible. This correct mode of removing the\r\napparent incongruity of continuous and instantaneous force, was a\r\nmaterial step in the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\6: _Op._ iii. 210.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\6: iii. 211.]\r\n\r\nThe Laws of the mutual Impact of bodies were erroneously given by\r\nDescartes in his _Principia_; and appear to have been first\r\ncorrectly stated by Wren, Wallis, and Huyghens, who about the same\r\ntime (1669) sent papers to the Royal Society of London on the\r\nsubject. In these solutions, we perceive that men were gradually\r\ncoming to apprehend the Third Law of Motion in its most general\r\nsense; namely, that the Momentum (which is proportional to the Mass\r\nof the body and its Velocity jointly) may be taken for the measure\r\nof the effect; so that this Momentum is as much diminished in the\r\nstriking body by the resistance it experiences, as it is increased\r\nin the body struck by the Impact. This was sometimes expressed by\r\nsaying that \"the Quantity of Motion remains unaltered,\" _Quantity of\r\nMotion_ being used as synonymous with _Momentum_. Newton expressed\r\nit by saying that \"Action and Reaction are equal and opposite,\"\r\nwhich is still one of the most familiar modes of expressing the\r\nThird Law of Motion.\r\n\r\nIn this mode of stating the Law, we see an example of a propensity\r\nwhich has prevailed very generally among mathematicians; namely, a\r\ndisposition to present the fundamental laws of rest and of motion as\r\nif they were equally manifest, and, indeed, identical. The close\r\nanalogy and connection which exists between the principles of\r\nequilibrium and of motion, often led men to confound the evidence of\r\nthe two; and this confusion introduced an ambiguity in the use of\r\nwords, as we have seen in the case of Momentum, Force, and others.\r\nThe same may be said of _Action_ and _Reaction_, which have both a\r\nstatical and a dynamical signification. And by this means, the most\r\ngeneral statements of the laws of motion are made to coincide with\r\nthe most general statical propositions. For instance, Newton deduced\r\nfrom his principles the conclusion, that by the mutual action of\r\nbodies, the motion of their centre of gravity cannot be affected.\r\nMarriotte, in his _Traité de la_ {344} _Percussion_ (1684), had\r\nasserted this proposition for the case of direct impact. But by the\r\nreasoners of Newton's time, the dynamical proposition, that the\r\nmotion of the centre of gravity is not altered by the actual free\r\nmotion and impact of bodies, was associated with the statical\r\nproposition, that when bodies are in equilibrium, the centre of\r\ngravity cannot be made to ascend or descend by the _virtual_ motions\r\nof the bodies. This latter is a proposition which was assumed as\r\nself-evident by Torricelli; but which may more philosophically be\r\nproved from elementary statical principles.\r\n\r\nThis disposition to identify the elementary laws of equilibrium and\r\nof motion, led men to think too slightingly of the ancient solid and\r\nsufficient foundation of Statics, the doctrine of the lever. When\r\nthe progress of thought had opened men's minds to a more general\r\nview of the subject, it was considered as a blemish in the science\r\nto found it on the properties of one particular machine. Descartes\r\nsays in his Letters, that \"it is ridiculous to prove the pulley by\r\nmeans of the lever.\" And Varignon was led by similar reflections to\r\nthe project of his _Nouvelle Mécanique_, in which the whole of\r\nstatics should be founded on the composition of forces. This project\r\nwas published in 1687; but the work did not appear till 1725, after\r\nthe death of the author. Though the attempt to reduce the\r\nequilibrium of all machines to the composition of forces, is\r\nphilosophical and meritorious, the attempt to reduce the composition\r\nof Pressures to the composition of _Motions_, with which Varignon's\r\nwork is occupied, was a retrograde step in the subject, so far as\r\nthe progress of distinct mechanical ideas was concerned.\r\n\r\nThus, at the period at which we have now arrived, the Principles of\r\nElementary Mechanics were generally known and accepted; and there\r\nwas in the minds of mathematicians a prevalent tendency to reduce\r\nthem to the most simple and comprehensive form of which they\r\nadmitted. The execution of this simplification and extension, which\r\nwe term the generalization of the laws, is so important an event,\r\nthat though it forms part of the natural sequel of Galileo, we shall\r\ntreat of it in a separate chapter. But we must first bring up the\r\nhistory of the mechanics of fluids to the corresponding point. {345}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES OF FLUIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Rediscovery of the Laws of Equilibrium of Fluids._\r\n\r\nWE have already said, that the true laws of the equilibrium of\r\nfluids were discovered by Archimedes, and rediscovered by Galileo\r\nand Stevinus; the intermediate time having been occupied by a\r\nvagueness and confusion of thought on physical subjects, which made\r\nit impossible for men to retain such clear views as Archimedes had\r\ndisclosed. Stevinus must be considered as the earliest of the\r\nauthors of this rediscovery; for his work (_Principles of Statik and\r\nHydrostatik_) was published in Dutch about 1585; and in this, his\r\nviews are perfectly distinct and correct. He restates the doctrines\r\nof Archimedes, and shows that, as a consequence of them, it follows\r\nthat the pressure of a fluid on the bottom of a vessel may be much\r\ngreater than the weight of the fluid itself: this he proves, by\r\nimagining some of the upper portions of the vessel to be filled with\r\nfixed solid bodies, which take the place of the fluid, and yet do\r\nnot alter the pressure on the base. He also shows what will be the\r\npressure on any portion of a base in an oblique position; and hence,\r\nby certain mathematical artifices which make an approach to the\r\nInfinitesimal Calculus, he finds the whole pressure on the base in\r\nsuch cases. This mode of treating the subject would take in a large\r\nportion of our elementary Hydrostatics as the science now stands.\r\nGalileo saw the properties of fluids no less clearly, and explained\r\nthem very distinctly, in 1612, in his _Discourse on Floating\r\nBodies_. It had been maintained by the Aristotelians, that _form_\r\nwas the cause of bodies floating; and collaterally, that ice was\r\n_condensed_ water; apparently from a confusion of thought between\r\n_rigidity_ and _density_. Galileo asserted, on the contrary, that\r\nice is _rarefied_ water, as appears by its floating: and in support\r\nof this, he proved, by various experiments, that the floating of\r\nbodies does not depend on their form. The happy genius of Galileo is\r\nthe more remarkable in this case, as the controversy was a good deal\r\nperplexed by the mixture of phenomena of another kind, due to what\r\nis usually called _capillary_ or _molecular attraction_. Thus it is\r\na fact, that a _ball_ {346} of ebony sinks in water, while a _flat\r\nslip_ of the same material lies on the surface; and it required\r\nconsiderable sagacity to separate such cases from the general rule.\r\nGalileo's opinions were attacked by various writers, as Nozzolini,\r\nVincenzio di Grazia, Ludovico delle Colombe; and defended by his\r\npupil Castelli, who published a reply in 1615. These opinions were\r\ngenerally adopted and diffused; but somewhat later, Pascal pursued\r\nthe subject more systematically, and wrote his _Treatise of the\r\nEquilibrium of Fluids_ in 1653; in which he shows that a fluid,\r\ninclosed in a vessel, necessarily presses equally in all directions,\r\nby imagining two _pistons_ or sliding plugs, applied at different\r\nparts, the surface of one being centuple that of the other: it is\r\nclear, as he observes, that the force of one man acting at the first\r\npiston, will balance the force of one hundred men acting at the\r\nother. \"And thus,\" says he, \"it appears that a vessel full of water\r\nis a new Principle of Mechanics, and a new Machine which will\r\nmultiply force to any degree we choose.\" Pascal also referred the\r\nequilibrium of fluids to the \"principle of virtual velocities,\"\r\nwhich regulates the equilibrium of other machines. This, indeed,\r\nGalileo had done before him. It followed from this doctrine, that\r\nthe pressure which is exercised by the lower parts of a fluid arises\r\nfrom the weight of the upper parts.\r\n\r\nIn all this there was nothing which was not easily assented to; but\r\nthe extension of these doctrines to the air required an additional\r\neffort of mechanical conception. The pressure of the air on all\r\nsides of us, and its weight above us, were two truths which had\r\nnever yet been apprehended with any kind of clearness. Seneca,\r\nindeed,[29\\6] talks of the \"gravity of the air,\" and of its power of\r\ndiffusing itself when condensed, as the causes of wind; but we can\r\nhardly consider such propriety of phraseology in him as more than a\r\nchance; for we see the value of his philosophy by what he\r\nimmediately adds: \"Do you think that we have forces by which we move\r\nourselves, and that the air is left without any power of moving?\r\nwhen even water has a motion of its own, as we see in the growth of\r\nplants.\" We can hardly attach much value to such a recognition of\r\nthe gravity and elasticity of the air.\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\6: _Quæst. Nat._ v. 5.]\r\n\r\nYet the effects of these causes were so numerous and obvious, that\r\nthe Aristotelians had been obliged to invent a principle to account\r\nfor them; namely, \"Nature's Horror of a Vacuum.\" To this principle\r\nwere referred many familiar phenomena, as suction, breathing, the\r\n{347} action of a pair of bellows, its drawing water if immersed in\r\nwater, its refusing to open when the rent is stopped up. The action\r\nof a cupping instrument, in which the air is rarefied by fire; the\r\nfact that water is supported when a full inverted bottle is placed\r\nin a basin; or when a full tube, open below and closed above, is\r\nsimilarly placed; the running out of the water, in this instance,\r\nwhen the top is opened; the action of a siphon, of a syringe, of a\r\npump; the adhesion of two polished plates, and other facts, were all\r\nexplained by the _fuga vacui_. Indeed, we must contend that the\r\nprinciple was a very good one, inasmuch as it brought together all\r\nthese facts which are really of the same kind, and referred them to\r\na common cause. But when urged as an ultimate principle, it was not\r\nonly _unphilosophical_, but _imperfect_ and _wrong_. It was\r\n_unphilosophical_, because it introduced the notion of an emotion,\r\nHorror, as an account of physical facts; it was _imperfect_, because\r\nit was at best only a law of phenomena, not pointing out any\r\nphysical cause; and it was _wrong_, because it gave an unlimited\r\nextent to the effect. Accordingly, it led to mistakes. Thus\r\nMersenne, in 1644, speaks of a siphon which shall go over a\r\nmountain, being ignorant then that the effect of such an instrument\r\nwas limited to a height of thirty-four feet. A few years later,\r\nhowever, he had detected this mistake; and in his third volume,\r\npublished in 1647, he puts his siphon in his _emendanda_, and speaks\r\ncorrectly of the weight of air as supporting the mercury in the tube\r\nof Torricelli. It was, indeed, by finding this horror of a vacuum to\r\nhave a limit at the height of thirty-four feet, that the true\r\nprinciple was suggested. It was discovered that when attempts were\r\nmade to raise water higher than this. Nature tolerated a vacuum\r\nabove the water which rose. In 1643, Torricelli tried to produce\r\nthis vacuum at a smaller height, by using, instead of water, the\r\nheavier fluid, quicksilver; an attempt which shows that the true\r\nexplanation, the balance of the weight of the water by another\r\npressure, had already suggested itself. Indeed, this appears from\r\nother evidence. Galileo had already taught that the air has weight;\r\nand Baliani, writing to him in 1630, says,[30\\6] \"If we were in a\r\nvacuum, the weight of the air above our heads would be felt.\"\r\nDescartes also appears to have some share in this discovery; for, in\r\na letter of the date of 1631, he explains the suspension of mercury\r\nin a tube, closed at top, by the pressure of the column of air\r\nreaching to the clouds. {348}\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\6: Drinkwater's _Galileo_, p. 90.]\r\n\r\nStill men's minds wanted confirmation in this view; and they found\r\nsuch confirmation, when, in 1647, Pascal showed practically, that if\r\nwe alter the length of the superincumbent column of air by going to\r\na high place, we alter the weight which it will support. This\r\ncelebrated experiment was made by Pascal himself on a church-steeple\r\nin Paris, the column of mercury in the Torricellian tube being used\r\nto compare the weights of the air; but he wrote to his\r\nbrother-in-law, who lived near the high mountain of Puy de Dôme in\r\nAuvergne, to request him to make the experiment there, where the\r\nresult would be more decisive. \"You see,\" he says, \"that if it\r\nhappens that the height of the mercury at the top of the hill be\r\nless than at the bottom (which I have many reasons to believe,\r\nthough all those who have thought about it are of a different\r\nopinion), it will follow that the weight and pressure of the air are\r\nthe sole cause of this suspension, and not the horror of a vacuum:\r\nsince it is very certain that there is more air to weigh on it at\r\nthe bottom than at the top; while we cannot say that nature abhors a\r\nvacuum at the foot of a mountain more than on its summit.\"--M.\r\nPerrier, Pascal's correspondent, made the observation as he had\r\ndesired, and found a difference of three inches of mercury, \"which,\"\r\nhe says, \"ravished us with admiration and astonishment.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the least obvious case of the operation of the pressure and\r\nweight of fluids had thus been made out, there were no further\r\ndifficulties in the progress of the theory of Hydrostatics. When\r\nmathematicians began to consider more general cases than those of\r\nthe action of gravity, there arose differences in the way of stating\r\nthe appropriate principles: but none of these differences imply any\r\ndifferent conception of the fundamental nature of fluid equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Discovery of the Laws of Motion of Fluids._\r\n\r\nTHE art of conducting water in pipes, and of directing its motion\r\nfor various purposes, is very old. When treated systematically, it\r\nhas been termed _Hydraulics_: but _Hydrodynamics_ is the general\r\nname of the science of the laws of the motions of fluids, under\r\nthose or other circumstances. The Art is as old as the commencement\r\nof civilization: the Science does not ascend higher than the time of\r\nNewton, though attempts on such subjects were made by Galileo and\r\nhis scholars.\r\n\r\nWhen a fluid spouts from an orifice in a vessel, Castelli saw that\r\nthe velocity of efflux depends on the depth of the orifice below the\r\n{349} surface: but he erroneously judged the velocity to be exactly\r\nproportional to the depth. Torricelli found that the fluid, under\r\nthe inevitable causes of defect which occur in the experiment, would\r\nspout nearly to the height of the surface: he therefore inferred,\r\nthat the full velocity is that which a body would acquire in falling\r\nthrough the depth; and that it is consequently proportional to the\r\nsquare root of the depth.--This, however, he stated only as a result\r\nof experience, or law of phenomena, at the end of his treatise, _De\r\nMotu Naturaliter Accelerato_, printed in 1643.\r\n\r\nNewton treated the subject theoretically in the _Principia_ (1687);\r\nbut we must allow, as Lagrange says, that this is the least\r\nsatisfactory passage of that great work. Newton, having made his\r\nexperiments in another manner than Torricelli, namely, by measuring\r\nthe quantity of the efflux instead of its velocity, found a result\r\ninconsistent with that of Torricelli. The velocity inferred from the\r\nquantity discharged, was only that due to _half_ the depth of the\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of the _Principia_,[31\\6] Newton gave a train\r\nof reasoning by which he theoretically demonstrated his own result,\r\ngoing upon the principle, that the momentum of the issuing fluid is\r\nequal to the momentum which the column vertically over the orifice\r\nwould generate by its gravity. But Torricelli's experiments, which\r\nhad given the velocity due to the whole depth, were confirmed on\r\nrepetition: how was this discrepancy to be explained?\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\6: B. ii. Prop. xxxvii.]\r\n\r\nNewton explained the discrepancy by observing the contraction which\r\nthe jet, or vein of water, undergoes, just after it leaves the\r\norifice, and which he called the _vena contracta_. At the orifice,\r\nthe velocity is that due to half the height; at the _vena contracta_\r\nit is that due to the whole height. The former velocity regulates\r\nthe quantity of the discharge; the latter, the path of the jet.\r\n\r\nThis explanation was an important step in the subject; but it made\r\nNewton's original proof appear very defective, to say the least. In\r\nthe second edition of the _Principia_ (1714), Newton attacked the\r\nproblem in a manner altogether different from his former\r\ninvestigation. He there assumed, that when a round vessel, containing\r\nfluid, has a hole in its bottom, the descending fluid may be\r\nconceived to be a conoidal mass, which has its base at the surface of\r\nthe fluid, and its narrow end at the orifice. This portion of the\r\nfluid he calls the _cataract_; and supposes that while this part\r\ndescends, the surrounding {350} parts remain immovable, as if they\r\nwere frozen; in this way he finds a result agreeing with Torricelli's\r\nexperiments on the velocity of the efflux.\r\n\r\nWe must allow that the assumptions by which this result is obtained\r\nare somewhat arbitrary; and those which Newton introduces in\r\nattempting to connect the problem of issuing fluids with that of the\r\nresistance to a body moving in a fluid, are no less so. But even up\r\nto the present time, mathematicians have not been able to reduce\r\nproblems concerning the motions of fluids to mathematical principles\r\nand calculations, without introducing some steps of this arbitrary\r\nkind. And one of the uses of experiments on this subject is, to\r\nsuggest those hypotheses which may enable us, in the manner most\r\nconsonant with the true state of things, to reduce the motions of\r\nfluids to those general laws of mechanics, to which we know they\r\nmust be subject.\r\n\r\nHence the science of the Motion of Fluids, unlike all the other\r\nprimary departments of Mechanics, is a subject on which we still\r\nneed experiments, to point out the fundamental principles. Many such\r\nexperiments have been made, with a view either to compare the\r\nresults of deduction and observation, or, when this comparison\r\nfailed, to obtain purely empirical rules. In this way the resistance\r\nof fluids, and the motion of water in pipes, canals, and rivers, has\r\nbeen treated. Italy has possessed, from early times, a large body of\r\nsuch writers. The earlier works of this kind have been collected in\r\nsixteen quarto volumes. Lecchi and Michelotti about 1765, Bidone\r\nmore recently, have pursued these inquiries. Bossut, Buat, Hachette,\r\nin France, have labored at the same task, as have Coulomb and Prony,\r\nGirard and Poncelet. Eytelwein's German treatise (_Hydraulik_)\r\ncontains an account of what others and himself have done. Many of\r\nthese trains of experiments, both in France and Italy, were made at\r\nthe expense of governments, and on a very magnificent scale. In\r\nEngland less was done in this way during the last century, than in\r\nmost other countries. The _Philosophical Transactions_, for\r\ninstance, scarcely contain a single paper on this subject founded on\r\nexperimental investigations.[32\\6] Dr. Thomas Young, who was at the\r\nhead of his countrymen in so many branches of science, was one of\r\nthe first to call back attention to this: and Mr. Rennie and others\r\nhave recently made valuable experiments. In many of the questions\r\nnow spoken of, the accordance which engineers are able to obtain,\r\nbetween their calculated and observed results, {351} is very great:\r\nbut these calculations are performed by means of empirical formulæ,\r\nwhich do not connect the facts with their causes, and still leave a\r\nwide space to be traversed, in order to complete the science.\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\6: Rennie, _Report to Brit. Assoc._]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, all the other portions of Mechanics were reduced\r\nto general laws, and analytical processes; and means were found of\r\nincluding Hydrodynamics, notwithstanding the difficulties which\r\nattend its special problems, in this common improvement of form.\r\nThis progress we must relate.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [The hydrodynamical problems referred to above are, the\r\nlaws of a fluid issuing from a vessel, the laws of the motion of\r\nwater in pipes, canals, and rivers, and the laws of the resistance\r\nof fluids. To these may be added, as an hydrodynamical problem\r\nimportant in theory, in experiment, and in the comparison of the\r\ntwo, the laws of waves. Newton gave, in the _Principia_, an\r\nexplanation of the waves of water (Lib. ii. Prop. 44), which appears\r\nto proceed upon an erroneous view of the nature of the motion of the\r\nfluid: but in his solution of the problem of sound, appeared, for\r\nthe first time, a correct view of the propagation of an undulation\r\nin a fluid. The history of this subject, as bearing upon the theory\r\nof sound, is given in Book viii.: but I may here remark, that the\r\nlaws of the motion of waves have been pursued experimentally by\r\nvarious persons, as Bremontier (_Recherches sur le Mouvement des\r\nOndes_, 1809), Emy (_Du Mouvement des Ondes_, 1831), the Webers\r\n(_Wellenlehre_, 1825); and by Mr. Scott Russell (_Reports of the\r\nBritish Association_, 1844). The analytical theory has been carried\r\non by Poisson, Cauchy, and, among ourselves, by Prof. Kelland\r\n(_Edin. Trans._) and Mr. Airy (in the article _Tides_, in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Metropolitana_). And though theory and experiment have\r\nnot yet been brought into complete accordance, great progress has\r\nbeen made in that work, and the remaining chasm between the two is\r\nmanifestly due only to the incompleteness of both.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable case of fluid motion recently discussed,\r\nis one which Mr. Scott Russell has presented experimentally; and\r\nwhich, though novel, is easily seen to follow from known principles;\r\nnamely, the _Great Solitary Wave_. A wave may be produced, which\r\nshall move along a canal unaccompanied by any other wave: and the\r\nsimplicity of this case makes the mathematical conditions and\r\nconsequences more simple than they are in most other problems of\r\nHydrodynamics. {352}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGENERALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Generalization of the Second Law of Motion.--Central\r\nForces._\r\n\r\nTHE Second Law of Motion being proved for constant Forces which act\r\nin parallel lines, and the Third Law for the Direct Action of\r\nbodies, it still required great mathematical talent, and some\r\ninductive power, to see clearly the laws which govern the motion of\r\nany number of bodies, acted upon by each other, and by any forces,\r\nanyhow varying in magnitude and direction. This was the task of the\r\ngeneralization of the laws of motion.\r\n\r\nGalileo had convinced himself that the velocity of projection, and\r\nthat which gravity alone would produce, are \"both maintained,\r\nwithout being altered, perturbed, or impeded in their mixture.\" It\r\nis to be observed, however, that the truth of this result depends\r\nupon a particular circumstance, namely, that gravity, at all points,\r\nacts in lines, which, as to sense, are parallel. When we have to\r\nconsider cases in which this is not true, as when the force tends to\r\nthe centre of a circle, the law of composition cannot be applied in\r\nthe same way; and, in this case, mathematicians were met by some\r\npeculiar difficulties.\r\n\r\nOne of these difficulties arises from the apparent inconsistency of\r\nthe statical and dynamical measures of force. When a body moves in a\r\ncircle, the force which urges the body to the centre is only a\r\n_tendency_ to motion; for the body does not, in fact, approach to\r\nthe centre; and this mere tendency to motion is combined with an\r\nactual motion, which takes place in the circumference. We appear to\r\nhave to compare two things which are heterogeneous. Descartes had\r\nnoticed this difficulty, but without giving any satisfactory\r\nsolution of it.[33\\6] If we combine the actual motion to or from the\r\ncentre with the traverse motion about the centre, we obtain a result\r\nwhich is false on mechanical principles. Galileo endeavored in this\r\nway to find the curve described by a body which falls towards the\r\nearth's centre, and is, at the same time, carried {353} round by the\r\nmotion of the earth; and obtained an erroneous result. Kepler and\r\nFermat attempted the same problem, and obtained solutions different\r\nfrom that of Galileo, but not more correct.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\6: _Princip._ P. iii. 59.]\r\n\r\nEven Newton, at an early period of his speculations, had an\r\nerroneous opinion respecting this curve, which he imagined to be a\r\nkind of spiral. Hooke animadverted upon this opinion when it was\r\nlaid before the Royal Society of London in 1679, and stated, more\r\ntruly, that, supposing no resistance, it would be \"an eccentric\r\nellipsoid,\" that is, a figure resembling an ellipse. But though he\r\nhad made out the approximate form of the curve, in some unexplained\r\nway, we have no reason to believe that he possessed any means of\r\ndetermining the mathematical properties of the curve described in\r\nsuch a case. The perpetual composition of a central force with the\r\nprevious motion of the body, could not be successfully treated\r\nwithout the consideration of the Doctrine of Limits, or something\r\nequivalent to that doctrine. The first example which we have of the\r\nright solution of such a problem occurs, so far as I know, in the\r\nTheorems of Huyghens concerning Circular Motion, which were\r\npublished, without demonstration, at the end of his _Horologium\r\nOscillatorium_, in 1673. It was there asserted that when equal\r\nbodies describe circles, if the times are equal, the centrifugal\r\nforces will be as the diameters of the circles; if the velocities\r\nare equal, the forces will be reciprocally as the diameters, and so\r\non. In order to arrive at these propositions, Huyghens must,\r\nvirtually at least, have applied the Second Law of Motion to the\r\nlimiting elements of the curve, according to the way in which\r\nNewton, a few years later, gave the demonstration of the theorems of\r\nHuyghens in the _Principia_.\r\n\r\nThe growing persuasion that the motions of the heavenly bodies about\r\nthe sun might be explained by the action of central forces, gave a\r\npeculiar interest to these mechanical speculations, at the period\r\nnow under review. Indeed, it is not easy to state separately, as our\r\npresent object requires us to do, the progress of Mechanics, and the\r\nprogress of Astronomy. Yet the distinction which we have to make is,\r\nin its nature, sufficiently marked. It is, in fact, no less marked\r\nthan the distinction between speaking logically and speaking truly.\r\nThe framers of the science of motion were employed in establishing\r\nthose notions, names, and rules, in conformity to which _all_\r\nmechanical _truth must_ be expressed; but _what was the truth_ with\r\nregard to the mechanism of the universe remained to be determined by\r\nother means. Physical Astronomy, at the period of which we speak,\r\neclipsed and overlaid {354} theoretical Mechanics, as, a little\r\npreviously, Dynamics had eclipsed and superseded Statics.\r\n\r\nThe laws of variable force and of curvilinear motion were not much\r\npursued, till the invention of Fluxions and of the Differential\r\nCalculus again turned men's minds to these subjects, as easy and\r\ninteresting exercises of the powers of these new methods. Newton's\r\n_Principia_, of which the first two Books are purely dynamical, is\r\nthe great exception to this assertion; inasmuch as it contains\r\ncorrect solutions of a great variety of the most general problems of\r\nthe science; and indeed is, even yet, one of the most complete\r\ntreatises which we possess upon the subject.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Kepler, in his attempts to explain the curvilinear\r\nmotions of the planets by means of a central force, failed, in\r\nconsequence of his belief that a continued transverse action of the\r\ncentral body was requisite to keep up a continual motion. Galileo\r\nhad founded his theory of projectiles on the principle that such an\r\naction was not necessary; yet Borelli, a pupil of Galileo, when, in\r\n1666, he published his theory of the Medicean Stars (the satellites\r\nof Jupiter), did not keep quite clear of the same errors which had\r\nvitiated Kepler's reasonings. In the same way, though Descartes is\r\nsometimes spoken of as the first promulgator of the First Law of\r\nMotion, yet his theory of Vortices must have been mainly suggested\r\nby a want of an entire confidence in that law. When he represented\r\nthe planets and satellites as owing their motions to oceans of fluid\r\ndiffused through the celestial spaces, and constantly whirling round\r\nthe central bodies, he must have felt afraid of trusting the planets\r\nto the operation of the laws of motion in free space. Sounder\r\nphysical philosophers, however, began to perceive the real nature of\r\nthe question. As early as 1666, we read, in the Journals of the\r\nRoyal Society, that \"there was read a paper of Mr. Hooke's\r\nexplicating the inflexion of a direct motion into a curve by a\r\nsupervening attractive principle;\" and before the publication of the\r\n_Principia_ in 1687, Huyghens, as we have seen, in Holland, and, in\r\nour own country, Wren, Halley, and Hooke, had made some progress in\r\nthe true mechanics of circular motion,[34\\6] and had distinctly\r\ncontemplated the problem of the motion of a body in an ellipse by a\r\ncentral force, though they could not solve it. Halley went to\r\nCambridge in 1684,[35\\6] for the express purpose of consulting\r\nNewton upon the subject of the production of the elliptical motion\r\nof the planets by means of a central {355} force, and, on the 10th\r\nof December,[36\\6] announced to the Royal Society that he had seen\r\nMr. Newton's book, _De Motu Corporum_. The feeling that\r\nmathematicians were on the brink of discoveries such as are\r\ncontained in this work was so strong, that Dr. Halley was requested\r\nto remind Mr. Newton of his promise of entering them in the Register\r\nof the Society, \"for securing the invention to himself till such\r\ntime as he can be at leisure to publish it.\" The manuscript, with\r\nthe title _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_, was\r\npresented to the society (to which it was dedicated) on the 28th of\r\nApril, 1686. Dr. Vincent, who presented it, spoke of the novelty and\r\ndignity of the subject; and the president (Sir J. Hoskins) added,\r\nwith great truth, \"that the method was so much the more to be prized\r\nas it was both invented and perfected at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\6: Newt. _Princip._ Schol. to Prop. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\6: Sir D. Brewster's _Life of Newton_, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\6: Id. p. 184.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will recollect that we are here speaking of the\r\n_Principia_ as a Mechanical Treatise only; we shall afterwards have\r\nto consider it as containing the greatest discoveries of Physical\r\nAstronomy. As a work on Dynamics, its merit is, that it exhibits a\r\nwonderful store of refined and beautiful mathematical artifices,\r\napplied to solve all the most general problems which the subject\r\noffered. The _Principia_ can hardly be said to contain any new\r\ninductive discovery respecting the principles of mechanics; for\r\nthough Newton's _Axioms or Laws of Motion_ which stand at the\r\nbeginning of the book, are a much clearer and more general statement\r\nof the grounds of Mechanics than had yet appeared, they do not\r\ninvolve any doctrines which had not been previously stated or taken\r\nfor granted by other mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe work, however, besides its unrivalled mathematical skill,\r\nemployed in tracing out, deductively, the consequences of the laws\r\nof motion, and its great cosmical discoveries, which we shall\r\nhereafter treat of, had great philosophical value in the history of\r\nDynamics, as exhibiting a clear conception of the new character and\r\nfunctions of that science. In his Preface, Newton says, \"Rational\r\nMechanics must be the science of the Motions which result from any\r\nForces, and of the Forces which are required for any Motions,\r\naccurately propounded and demonstrated. For many things induce me to\r\nsuspect, that all natural phenomena may depend upon some Forces by\r\nwhich the particles of bodies are either drawn towards each other,\r\nand cohere, or repel and recede from each other: and these Forces\r\nbeing hitherto unknown, philosophers have pursued their researches\r\nin vain. And I hope {356} that the principles expounded in this work\r\nwill afford some light, either to this mode of philosophizing, or to\r\nsome mode which is more true.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we pursue this subject further, we must trace the remainder\r\nof the history of the Third Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Generalization of the Third Law of Motion.--Centre of\r\nOscillation.--Huyghens._\r\n\r\nTHE Third Law of Motion, whether expressed according to Newton's\r\nformula (by the equality of Action and Reaction), or in any other of\r\nthe ways employed about the same time, easily gave the solution of\r\nmechanical problems in all cases of _direct_ action; that is, when\r\neach body acted directly on others. But there still remained the\r\nproblems in which the action is _indirect_;--when bodies, in motion,\r\nact on each other by the intervention of levers, or in any other\r\nway. If a rigid rod, passing through two weights, be made to swing\r\nabout its upper point, so as to form a pendulum, each weight will\r\nact and react on the other by means of the rod, considered as a\r\nlever turning about the point of suspension. What, in this case,\r\nwill be the effect of this action and reaction? In what time will\r\nthe pendulum oscillate by the force of gravity? Where is the point\r\nat which a single weight must be placed to oscillate in the same\r\ntime? in other words, where is the _Centre of Oscillation_?\r\n\r\nSuch was the problem--an example only of the general problem of\r\nindirect action--which mathematicians had to solve. That it was by\r\nno means easy to see in what manner the law of the communication of\r\nmotion was to be extended from simpler cases to those where rotatory\r\nmotion was produced, is shown by this;--that Newton, in attempting\r\nto solve the mechanical problem of the Precession of the Equinoxes,\r\nfell into a serious error on this very subject. He assumed that,\r\nwhen a part has to communicate rotatory movement to the whole (as\r\nthe protuberant portion of the terrestrial spheroid, attracted by\r\nthe sun and moon, communicates a small movement to the whole mass of\r\nthe earth), the quantity of the _motion_, \"motus,\" will not be\r\naltered by being communicated. This principle is true, if, by\r\n_motion_, we understand what is called _moment of inertia_, a\r\nquantity in which both the velocity of each particle and its\r\ndistance from the axis of rotation are taken into account: but\r\nNewton, in his calculations of its amount, considered the velocity\r\nonly; thus making _motion_, in this case, identical with the\r\n_momentum_ which he introduces in treating of the simpler case {357}\r\nof the third law of motion, when the action is direct. This error\r\nwas retained even in the later editions of the _Principia_.[37\\6]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\6: B. iii. Lemma iii. to Prop, xxxix.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the centre of oscillation had been proposed by\r\nMersenne somewhat earlier,[38\\6] in 1646. And though the problem was\r\nout of the reach of any principles at that time known and\r\nunderstood, some of the mathematicians of the day had rightly solved\r\nsome cases of it, by proceeding as if the question had been to find\r\nthe _Centre of Percussion_. The Centre of Percussion is the point\r\nabout which the momenta of all the parts of a body balance each\r\nother, when it is in motion about any axis, and is stopped by\r\nstriking against an obstacle placed at that centre. Roberval found\r\nthis point in some easy cases; Descartes also attempted the problem;\r\ntheir rival labors led to an angry controversy: and Descartes was,\r\nas in his physical speculations he often was, very presumptuous,\r\nthough not more than half right.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\6: Mont. ii. 423.]\r\n\r\nHuyghens was hardly advanced beyond boyhood when Mersenne first\r\nproposed this problem; and, as he says,[39\\6] could see no principle\r\nwhich even offered an opening to the solution, and had thus been\r\nrepelled at the threshold. When, however, he published his\r\n_Horologium Oscillatorium_ in 1673, the fourth part of that work was\r\non the Centre of Oscillation or Agitation; and the principle which\r\nhe then assumed, though not so simple and self-evident as those to\r\nwhich such problems were afterwards referred, was perfectly correct\r\nand general, and led to exact solutions in all cases. The reader has\r\nalready seen repeatedly in the course of this history, complex and\r\nderivative principles presenting themselves to men's minds, before\r\nsimple and elementary ones. The \"hypothesis\" assumed by Huyghens was\r\nthis; \"that if any weights are put in motion by the force of\r\ngravity, they _cannot_ move so that the centre of gravity of them\r\nall shall rise _higher_ than the place from which it descended.\"\r\nThis being assumed, it is easy to show that the centre of gravity\r\nwill, under all circumstances, rise _as high_ as its original\r\nposition; and this consideration leads to a determination of the\r\noscillation of a compound pendulum. We may observe, in the principle\r\nthus selected, a conviction that, in all mechanical action, the\r\ncentre of gravity may be taken as the representative of the whole\r\nsystem. This conviction, as we have seen, may be traced in the\r\naxioms of Archimedes and Stevinus; and Huyghens, when he proceeds\r\nupon it, undertakes to show,[40\\6] that he assumes only this, that a\r\nheavy body cannot, of itself, move upwards. {358}\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\6: _Hor. Osc._ Pref.]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\6: _Hor. Osc._ p. 121.]\r\n\r\nClear as Huyghen's principle appeared to himself, it was, after some\r\ntime, attacked by the Abbé Catelan, a zealous Cartesian. Catelan\r\nalso put forth principles which he conceived were evident, and\r\ndeduced from them conclusions contradictory to those of Huyghens.\r\nHis principles, now that we know them to be false, appear to us very\r\ngratuitous. They are these; \"that in a compound pendulum, the sum of\r\nthe velocities of the component weights is equal to the sum of the\r\nvelocities which they would have acquired if they had been detached\r\npendulums;\" and \"that the time of the vibration of a compound\r\npendulum is an arithmetic mean between the times of the vibrations\r\nof the weights, moving as detached pendulums.\" Huyghens easily\r\nshowed that these suppositions would make the centre of gravity\r\nascend to a greater height than that from which it fell; and after\r\nsome time, James Bernoulli stept into the arena, and ranged himself\r\non the side of Huyghens. As the discussion thus proceeded, it began\r\nto be seen that the question really was, in what manner the Third\r\nLaw of Motion was to be extended to cases of indirect action;\r\nwhether by distributing the action and reaction according to\r\nstatical principles, or in some other way. \"I propose it to the\r\nconsideration of mathematicians,\" says Bernoulli in 1686, \"what law\r\nof the communication of velocity is observed by bodies in motion,\r\nwhich are sustained at one extremity by a fixed fulcrum, and at the\r\nother by a body also moving, but more slowly. Is the excess of\r\nvelocity which must be communicated from the one body to the other\r\nto be distributed in the same proportion in which a load supported\r\non the lever would be distributed?\" He adds, that if this question\r\nbe answered in the affirmative, Huyghens will be found to be in\r\nerror; but this is a mistake. The principle, that the action and\r\nreaction of bodies thus moving are to be distributed according to\r\nthe rules of the lever, is true; but Bernoulli mistook, in\r\nestimating this action and reaction by the _velocity_ acquired at\r\nany moment; instead of taking, as he should have done, the\r\n_increment_ of velocity which gravity tended to impress in the next\r\ninstant. This was shown by the Marquis de l'Hôpital; who adds, with\r\njustice, \"I conceive that I have thus fully answered the call of\r\nBernoulli, when he says, I propose it to the consideration of\r\nmathematicians, &c.\"\r\n\r\nWe may, from this time, consider as known, but not as fully\r\nestablished, the principle that \"When bodies in motion affect each\r\nother, the action and reaction are distributed according to the laws\r\nof Statics;\" although there were still found occasional difficulties\r\nin the {359} generalization and application of the role. James\r\nBernoulli, in 1703, gave \"a General Demonstration of the Centre of\r\nOscillation, drawn from the nature of the Lever.\" In this\r\ndemonstration[41\\6] he takes as a fundamental principle, that bodies\r\nin motion, connected by levers, balance, when the products of their\r\nmomenta and the lengths of the levers are equal in opposite\r\ndirections. For the proof of this proposition, he refers to Marriotte,\r\nwho had asserted it of weights acting by percussion,[42\\6] and in\r\norder to prove it, had balanced the effect of a weight on a lever by\r\nthe effect of a jet of water, and had confirmed it by other\r\nexperiments.[43\\6] Moreover, says Bernoulli, there is no one who\r\ndenies it. Still, this kind of proof was hardly satisfactory or\r\nelementary enough. John Bernoulli took up the subject after the death\r\nof his brother James, which happened in 1705. The former published in\r\n1714 his _Meditatio de Naturâ Centri Oscillationis_. In this memoir,\r\nhe assumes, as his brother had done, that the effects of forces on a\r\nlever in motion are distributed according to the common rules of the\r\nlever.[44\\6] The principal generalization which he introduced was,\r\nthat he considered gravity as a force soliciting to motion, which\r\nmight have different intensities in different bodies. At the same\r\ntime, Brook Taylor in England solved the problem, upon the same\r\nprinciples as Bernoulli; and the question of priority on this subject\r\nwas one point in the angry intercourse which, about this time, became\r\ncommon between the English mathematicians and those of the Continent.\r\nHermann also, in his _Phoronomia_, published in 1716, gave a proof\r\nwhich, as he informs us, he had devised before he saw John\r\nBernoulli's. This proof is founded on the statical equivalence of the\r\n\"_solicitations of gravity_\" and the \"_vicarious solicitations_\" which\r\ncorrespond to the actual motion of each part; or, as it has been\r\nexpressed by more modern writers, the equilibrium of the _impressed_\r\nand _effective forces_.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\6: _Op._ ii. 930.]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\6: _Choq. des Corps_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\6: Ib. Prop. xi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\6: P. 172.]\r\n\r\nIt was shown by John Bernoulli and Hermann, and was indeed easily\r\nproved, that the proposition assumed by Huyghens as the foundation\r\nof his solution, was, in fact, a consequence of the elementary\r\nprinciples which belong to this branch of mechanics. But this\r\nassumption of Huyghens was an example of a more general proposition,\r\nwhich by some mathematicians at this time had been put forward as an\r\noriginal and elementary law; and as a principle which ought to\r\nsupersede the usual measure of the forces of bodies in motion; this\r\nprinciple they called \"_the Conservation of Vis Viva_.\" The attempt\r\nto {360} make this change was the commencement of one of the most\r\nobstinate and curious of the controversies which form part of the\r\nhistory of mechanical science. The celebrated Leibnitz was the\r\nauthor of the new opinion. In 1686, he published, in the Leipsic\r\nActs, \"A short Demonstration of a memorable Error of Descartes and\r\nothers, concerning the natural law by which they think that God\r\nalways preserves the same quantity of motion; in which they pervert\r\nmechanics.\" The principle that the same quantity of motion, and\r\ntherefore of moving force, is always preserved in the world, follows\r\nfrom the equality of action and reaction; though Descartes had,\r\nafter his fashion, given a theological reason for it; Leibnitz\r\nallowed that the quantity of moving force remains always the same,\r\nbut denied that this force is measured by the quantity of motion or\r\nmomentum. He maintained that the same force is requisite to raise a\r\nweight of one pound through four feet, and a weight of four pounds\r\nthrough one foot, though the momenta in this case are as one to two.\r\nThis was answered by the Abbé de Conti; who truly observed, that\r\nallowing the effects in the two cases to be equal, this did not\r\nprove the forces to be equal; since the effect, in the first case,\r\nwas produced in a double time, and therefore it was quite consistent\r\nto suppose the force only half as great. Leibnitz, however,\r\npersisted in his innovation; and in 1695 laid down the distinction\r\nbetween _vires mortuæ_, or pressures, and _vires vivæ_, the name he\r\ngave to his own measure of force. He kept up a correspondence with\r\nJohn Bernoulli, whom he converted to his peculiar opinions on this\r\nsubject; or rather, as Bernoulli says,[45\\6] made him think for\r\nhimself, which ended in his proving directly that which Leibnitz had\r\ndefended by indirect reasons. Among other arguments, he had\r\npretended to show (what is certainly not true), that if the common\r\nmeasure of forces be adhered to, a perpetual motion would be\r\npossible. It is easy to collect many cases which admit of being very\r\nsimply and conveniently reasoned upon by means of the _vis viva_,\r\nthat is, by taking the force to be proportional to the _square_ of\r\nthe velocity, and not to the velocity itself. Thus, in order to give\r\nthe arrow _twice_ the velocity, the bow must be _four_ times as\r\nstrong; and in all cases in which no account is taken of the time of\r\nproducing the effect, we may conveniently use similar methods.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\6: _Op._ iii. 40.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not till a later period that the question excited any\r\ngeneral notice. The Academy of Sciences of Paris in 1724 proposed\r\n{361} as a subject for their prize dissertation the laws of the\r\nimpact of bodies. Bernoulli, as a competitor, wrote a treatise, upon\r\nLeibnitzian principles, which, though not honored with the prize,\r\nwas printed by the Academy with commendation.[46\\6] The opinions\r\nwhich he here defended and illustrated were adopted by several\r\nmathematicians; the controversy extended from the mathematical to\r\nthe literary world, at that time more attentive than usual to\r\nmathematical disputes, in consequence of the great struggle then\r\ngoing on between the Cartesian and the Newtonian system. It was,\r\nhowever, obvious that by this time the interest of the question, so\r\nfar as the progress of Dynamics was concerned, was at an end; for\r\nthe combatants all agreed as to the results in each particular case.\r\nThe Laws of Motion were now established; and the question was, by\r\nmeans of what definitions and abstractions could they be best\r\nexpressed;--a metaphysical, not a physical discussion, and therefore\r\none in which \"the paper philosophers,\" as Galileo called them, could\r\nbear a part. In the first volume of the _Transactions of the Academy\r\nof St. Petersburg_, published in 1728, there are three Leibnitzian\r\nmemoirs by Hermann, Bullfinger, and Wolff. In England, Clarke was an\r\nangry assailant of the German opinion, which S'Gravesande\r\nmaintained. In France, Mairan attacked the _vis viva_ in 1728; \"with\r\nstrong and victorious reasons,\" as the Marquise du Chatelet\r\ndeclared, in the first edition of her _Treatise on Fire_.[47\\6] But\r\nshortly after this praise was published, the Chateau de Cirey, where\r\nthe Marquise usually lived, became a school of Leibnitzian opinions,\r\nand the resort of the principal partisans of the _vis viva_. \"Soon,\"\r\nobserves Mairan, \"their language was changed; the _vis viva_ was\r\nenthroned by the side of the _monads_.\" The Marquise tried to\r\nretract or explain away her praises; she urged arguments on the\r\nother side. Still the question was not decided; even her friend\r\nVoltaire was not converted. In 1741 he read a memoir _On the Measure\r\nand Nature of Moving Forces_, in which he maintained the old\r\nopinion. Finally, D'Alembert in 1743 declared it to be, as it truly\r\nwas, a mere question of words; and by the turn which Dynamics then\r\ntook, it ceased to be of any possible interest or importance to\r\nmathematicians.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\6: _Discours sur les Loix de la Communication du Mouvement_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\6: Mont. iii. 640.]\r\n\r\nThe representation of the laws of motion and of the reasonings\r\ndepending on them, in the most general form, by means of analytical\r\nlanguage, cannot be said to have been fully achieved till the time of\r\nD'Alembert; but as we have already seen, the discovery of these laws\r\n{362} had taken place somewhat earlier; and that law which is more\r\nparticularly expressed in D'Alembert's Principle (_the equality of the\r\naction gained and lost_) was, it has been seen, rather led to by the\r\ngeneral current of the reasoning of mathematicians about the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century than discovered by any one. Huyghens,\r\nMarriotte, the two Bernoulli's, L'Hôpital, Taylor, and Hermann, have\r\neach of them their name in the history of this advance; but we cannot\r\nascribe to any of them any great real inductive sagacity shown in what\r\nthey thus contributed, except to Huyghens, who first seized the\r\nprinciple in such a form as to find the centre of oscillation by means\r\nof it. Indeed, in the steps taken by the others, language itself had\r\nalmost made the generalization for them at the time when they wrote;\r\nand it required no small degree of acuteness and care to distinguish\r\nthe old cases, in which the law had already been applied, from the new\r\ncases, in which they had to apply it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE GENERALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS.--PERIOD\r\nOF MATHEMATICAL DEDUCTION.--ANALYTICAL MECHANICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have now finished the history of the discovery of Mechanical\r\nPrinciples, strictly so called. The three Laws of Motion,\r\ngeneralized in the manner we have described, contain the materials\r\nof the whole structure of Mechanics; and in the remaining progress\r\nof the science, we are led to no new truth which was not implicitly\r\ninvolved in those previously known. It may be thought, therefore,\r\nthat the narrative of this progress is of comparatively small\r\ninterest. Nor do we maintain that the application and development of\r\nprinciples is a matter of so much importance to the philosophy of\r\nscience, as the advance towards and to them. Still, there are many\r\ncircumstances in the latter stages of the progress of the science of\r\nMechanics, which well deserve notice, and make a rapid survey of\r\nthat part of its history indispensable to our purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Laws of Motion are expressed in terms of Space and Number; the\r\ndevelopment of the consequences of these laws must, therefore, be\r\nperformed by means of the reasonings of mathematics; and the science\r\n{363} of Mechanics may assume the various aspects which belong to the\r\ndifferent modes of dealing with mathematical quantities. Mechanics,\r\nlike pure mathematics, may be geometrical or may be analytical; that\r\nis, it may treat space either by a direct consideration of its\r\nproperties, or by a symbolical representation of them: Mechanics, like\r\npure mathematics, may proceed from special cases, to problems and\r\nmethods of extreme generality;--may summon to its aid the curious and\r\nrefined relations of symmetry, by which general and complex conditions\r\nare simplified;--may become more powerful by the discovery of more\r\npowerful analytical artifices;--may even have the generality of its\r\nprinciples further expanded, inasmuch as symbols are a more general\r\nlanguage than words. We shall very briefly notice a series of\r\nmodifications of this kind.\r\n\r\n1. _Geometrical Mechanics. Newton, &c._--The first great\r\nsystematical Treatise on Mechanics, in the most general sense, is\r\nthe two first Books of the _Principia_ of Newton. In this work, the\r\nmethod employed is predominantly geometrical: not only space is not\r\nrepresented symbolically, or by reference to number; but numbers,\r\nas, for instance, those which measure time and force, are\r\nrepresented by spaces; and the laws of their changes are indicated\r\nby the properties of curve lines. It is well known that Newton\r\nemployed, by preference, methods of this kind in the exposition of\r\nhis theorems, even where he had made the discovery of them by\r\nanalytical calculations. The intuitions of space appeared to him, as\r\nthey have appeared to many of his followers, to be a more clear and\r\nsatisfactory road to knowledge, than the operations of symbolical\r\nlanguage. Hermann, whose _Phoronomia_ was the next great work on\r\nthis subject, pursued a like course; employing curves, which he\r\ncalls \"the scale of velocities,\" \"of forces,\" &c. Methods nearly\r\nsimilar were employed by the two first Bernoullis, and other\r\nmathematicians of that period; and were, indeed, so long familiar,\r\nthat the influence of them may still be traced in some of the terms\r\nwhich are used on such subjects; as, for instance, when we talk of\r\n\"reducing a problem to quadratures,\" that is, to the finding the\r\narea of the curves employed in these methods.\r\n\r\n2. _Analytical Mechanics. Euler._--As analysis was more cultivated,\r\nit gained a predominancy over geometry; being found to be a far more\r\npowerful instrument for obtaining results; and possessing a beauty\r\nand an evidence, which, though different from those of geometry, had\r\ngreat attractions for minds to which they became familiar. The\r\nperson who did most to give to analysis the generality and  {364}\r\nsymmetry which are now its pride, was also the person who made\r\nMechanics analytical; I mean Euler. He began his execution of this\r\ntask in various memoirs which appeared in the _Transactions of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences at St. Petersburg_, commencing with its earliest\r\nvolumes; and in 1736, he published there his _Mechanics, or the\r\nScience of Motion analytically expounded; in the way of a Supplement\r\nto the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Sciences_. In the\r\npreface to this work, he says, that though the solutions of problems\r\nby Newton and Hermann were quite satisfactory, yet he found that he\r\nhad a difficulty in applying them to new problems, differing little\r\nfrom theirs; and that, therefore, he thought it would be useful to\r\nextract an analysis out of their synthesis.\r\n\r\n3. _Mechanical Problems._--In reality, however, Euler has done much\r\nmore than merely give analytical methods, which may be applied to\r\nmechanical problems: he has himself applied such methods to an\r\nimmense number of cases. His transcendent mathematical powers, his\r\nlong and studious life, and the interest with which he pursued the\r\nsubject, led him to solve an almost inconceivable number and variety\r\nof mechanical problems. Such problems suggested themselves to him on\r\nall occasions. One of his memoirs begins, by stating that, happening\r\nto think of the line of Virgil,\r\n  Anchora de prorà jacitur stant litore puppes;\r\n  The anchor drops, the rushing keel is staid;\r\nhe could not help inquiring what would be the nature of the ship's\r\nmotion under the circumstances here described. And in the last few\r\ndays of his life, after his mortal illness had begun, having seen in\r\nthe newspapers some statements respecting balloons, he proceeded to\r\ncalculate their motions; and performed a difficult integration, in\r\nwhich this undertaking engaged him. His Memoirs occupy a very large\r\nportion of the _Petropolitan Transactions_ during his life, from 1728\r\nto 1783; and he declared that he should leave papers which might\r\nenrich the publications of the Academy of Petersburg for twenty years\r\nafter his death;--a promise which has been more than fulfilled; for,\r\nup to 1818, the volumes usually contain several Memoirs of his. He and\r\nhis contemporaries may be said to have exhausted the subject; for\r\nthere are few mechanical problems which have been since treated, which\r\nthey have not in some manner touched upon.\r\n\r\nI do not dwell upon the details of such problems; for the next great\r\nstep in Analytical Mechanics, the publication of D'Alembert's {365}\r\nPrinciple in 1743, in a great degree superseded their interest. The\r\nTransactions of the Academies of Paris and Berlin, as well as St.\r\nPetersburg, are filled, up to this time, with various questions of\r\nthis kind. They require, for the most part, the determination of the\r\nmotions of several bodies, with or without weight, which pull or\r\npush each other by means of threads, or levers, to which they are\r\nfastened, or along which they can slide; and which, having a certain\r\nimpulse given them at first, are then left to themselves, or are\r\ncompelled to move in given lines and surfaces. The postulate of\r\nHuyghens, respecting the motion of the centre of gravity, was\r\ngenerally one of the principles of the solution; but other\r\nprinciples were always needed in addition to this; and it required\r\nthe exercise of ingenuity and skill to detect the most suitable in\r\neach case. Such problems were, for some time, a sort of trial of\r\nstrength among mathematicians: the principle of D'Alembert put an\r\nend to this kind of challenges, by supplying a direct and general\r\nmethod of resolving, or at least of throwing into equations, any\r\nimaginable problem. The mechanical difficulties were in this way\r\nreduced to difficulties of pure mathematics.\r\n\r\n4. _D'Alembert's Principle._--D'Alembert's Principle is only the\r\nexpression, in the most general form, of the principle upon which\r\nJohn Bernoulli, Hermann, and others, had solved the problem of the\r\ncentre of oscillation. It was thus stated, \"The motion _impressed_\r\non each particle of any system by the forces which act upon it, may\r\nbe resolved into two, the _effective_ motion, and the motion gained\r\nor _lost_: the effective motions will be the real motions of the\r\nparts, and the motions gained and lost will be such as would keep\r\nthe system at rest.\" The distinction of _statics_, the doctrine of\r\nequilibrium, and _dynamics_, the doctrine of motion, was, as we have\r\nseen, fundamental; and the difference of difficulty and complexity\r\nin the two subjects was well understood, and generally recognized by\r\nmathematicians. D'Alembert's principle reduces every dynamical\r\nquestion to a statical one; and hence, by means of the conditions\r\nwhich connect the possible motions of the system, we can determine\r\nwhat the actual motions must be. The difficulty of determining the\r\nlaws of equilibrium, in the application of this principle in complex\r\ncases is, however, often as great as if we apply more simple and\r\ndirect considerations.\r\n\r\n5. _Motion in Resisting Media. Ballistics._--We shall notice more\r\nparticularly the history of some of the problems of mechanics.\r\nThough John Bernoulli always spoke with admiration of Newton's\r\n_Principia_, and of its author, he appears to have been well\r\ndisposed to point out {366} real or imagined blemishes in the work.\r\nAgainst the validity of Newton's determination of the path described\r\nby a body projected in any part of the solar system, Bernoulli urges\r\na cavil which it is difficult to conceive that a mathematician, such\r\nas he was, could seriously believe to be well founded. On Newton's\r\ndetermination of the path of a body in a resisting medium, his\r\ncriticism is more just. He pointed out a material error in this\r\nsolution: this correction came to Newton's knowledge in London, in\r\nOctober, 1712, when the impression of the second edition of the\r\nPrincipia was just drawing to a close, under the care of Cotes at\r\nCambridge; and Newton immediately cancelled the leaf and corrected\r\nthe error.[48\\6]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\6: MS. Correspondence in Trin. Coll. Library.]\r\n\r\nThis problem of the motion of a body in a resisting medium, led to\r\nanother collision between the English and the German mathematicians.\r\nThe proposition to which we have referred, gave only an indirect\r\nview of the nature of the curve described by a projectile in the\r\nair; and it is probable that Newton, when he wrote the _Principia_,\r\ndid not see his way to any direct and complete solution of this\r\nproblem. At a later period, in 1718, when the quarrel had waxed hot\r\nbetween the admirers of Newton and Leibnitz, Keill, who had come\r\nforward as a champion on the English side, proposed this problem to\r\nthe foreigners as a challenge. Keill probably imagined that what\r\nNewton had not discovered, no one of his time would be able to\r\ndiscover. But the sedulous cultivation of analysis by the Germans\r\nhad given them mathematical powers beyond the expectations of the\r\nEnglish; who, whatever might be their talents, had made little\r\nadvance in the effective use of general methods; and for a long\r\nperiod seemed to be fascinated to the spot, in their admiration of\r\nNewton's excellence. Bernoulli speedily solved the problem; and\r\nreasonably enough, according to the law of honor of such challenges,\r\ncalled upon the challenger to produce his solution. Keill was unable\r\nto do this; and after some attempts at procrastination, was driven\r\nto very paltry evasions. Bernoulli then published his solution, with\r\nvery just expressions of scorn towards his antagonist. And this may,\r\nperhaps, be considered as the first material addition which was made\r\nto the _Principia_ by subsequent writers.\r\n\r\n6. _Constellation of Mathematicians._--We pass with admiration along\r\nthe great series of mathematicians, by whom the science of\r\ntheoretical mechanics has been cultivated, from the time of Newton\r\nto our own. There is no group of men of science whose fame is {367}\r\nhigher or brighter. The great discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo,\r\nNewton, had fixed all eyes on those portions of human knowledge on\r\nwhich their successors employed their labors. The certainty\r\nbelonging to this line of speculation seemed to elevate\r\nmathematicians above the students of other subjects; and the beauty\r\nof mathematical relations, and the subtlety of intellect which may\r\nbe shown in dealing with them, were fitted to win unbounded\r\napplause. The successors of Newton and the Bernoullis, as Euler,\r\nClairaut, D'Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, not to introduce living\r\nnames, have been some of the most remarkable men of talent which the\r\nworld has seen. That their talent is, for the most part, of a\r\ndifferent kind from that by which the laws of nature were\r\ndiscovered, I shall have occasion to explain elsewhere; for the\r\npresent, I must endeavor to arrange the principal achievements of\r\nthose whom I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe series of persons is connected by social relations. Euler was\r\nthe pupil of the first generation of Bernoullis, and the intimate\r\nfriend of the second generation; and all these extraordinary men, as\r\nwell as Hermann, were of the city of Basil, in that age a spot\r\nfertile of great mathematicians to an unparalleled degree. In 1740,\r\nClairaut and Maupertuis visited John Bernoulli, at that time the\r\nNestor of mathematicians, who died, full of age and honors, in 1748.\r\nEuler, several of the Bernoullis, Maupertuis, Lagrange, among other\r\nmathematicians of smaller note, were called into the north by\r\nCatharine of Russia and Frederic of Prussia, to inspire and instruct\r\nacademies which the brilliant fame then attached to science, had\r\ninduced those monarchs to establish. The prizes proposed by these\r\nsocieties, and by the French Academy of Sciences, gave occasion to\r\nmany of the most valuable mathematical works of the century.\r\n\r\n7. _The Problem of Three Bodies._--In 1747, Clairaut and D'Alembert\r\nsent, on the same day, to this body, their solutions of the celebrated\r\n\"Problem of Three Bodies,\" which, from that time, became the great\r\nobject of attention of mathematicians;--the bow in which each tried\r\nhis strength, and endeavored to shoot further than his predecessors.\r\n\r\nThis problem was, in fact, the astronomical question of the effect\r\nproduced by the attraction of the sun, in disturbing the motions of\r\nthe moon about the earth; or by the attraction of one planet,\r\ndisturbing the motion of another planet about the sun; but being\r\nexpressed generally, as referring to one body which disturbs any two\r\nothers, it became a mechanical problem, and the history of it\r\nbelongs to the present subject. {368}\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the synthetical form adopted by Newton in the\r\n_Principia_, was, that his successors had the problem of the solar\r\nsystem to begin entirely anew. Those who would not do this, made no\r\nprogress, as was long the case with the English. Clairaut says, that\r\nhe tried for a long time to make some use of Newton's labors; but\r\nthat, at last, he resolved to take up the subject in an independent\r\nmanner. This, accordingly, he did, using analysis throughout, and\r\nfollowing methods not much different from those still employed. We\r\ndo not now speak of the comparison of this theory with observation,\r\nexcept to remark, that both by the agreements and by the\r\ndiscrepancies of this comparison, Clairaut and other writers were\r\nperpetually driven on to carry forwards the calculation to a greater\r\nand greater degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the cases in which this happened, was\r\nthat of the movement of the Apogee of the Moon; and in this case, a\r\nmode of approximating to the truth, which had been depended on as\r\nnearly exact, was, after having caused great perplexity, found by\r\nClairaut and Euler to give only half the truth. This same Problem of\r\nThree Bodies was the occasion of a memoir of Clairaut, which gained\r\nthe prize of the Academy of St. Petersburg in 1751; and, finally, of\r\nhis _Théorie de la Lune_, published in 1765. D'Alembert labored at\r\nthe same time on the same problem; and the value of their methods,\r\nand the merit of the inventors, unhappily became a subject of\r\ncontroversy between those two great mathematicians. Euler also, in\r\n1753, published a _Theory of the Moon_, which was, perhaps, more\r\nuseful than either of the others, since it was afterwards the basis\r\nof Mayer's method, and of his Tables. It is difficult to give the\r\ngeneral reader any distinct notion of these solutions. We may\r\nobserve, that the quantities which determine the moon's position,\r\nare to be determined by means of certain algebraical equations,\r\nwhich express the mechanical conditions of the motion. The\r\noperation, by which the result is to be obtained, involves the\r\nprocess of integration; which, in this instance, cannot be performed\r\nin an immediate and definite manner; since the quantities thus to be\r\noperated on depend upon the moon's position, and thus require us to\r\nknow the very thing which we have to determine by the operation. The\r\nresult must be got at, therefore, by successive approximations: we\r\nmust first find a quantity near the truth; and then, by the help of\r\nthis, one nearer still; and so on; and, in this manner, the moon's\r\nplace will be given by a converging series of terms. The form of\r\nthese terms depends upon the relations of position between the sun\r\n{369} and moon, their apogees, the moon's nodes, and other\r\nquantities; and by the variety of combinations of which these admit,\r\nthe terms become very numerous and complex. The magnitude of the\r\nterms depends also upon various circumstances; as the relative force\r\nof the sun and earth, the relative times of the solar and lunar\r\nrevolutions, the eccentricities and inclinations of the two orbits.\r\nThese are combined so as to give terms of different orders of\r\nmagnitudes; and it depends upon the skill and perseverance of the\r\nmathematician how far he will continue this series of terms. For\r\nthere is no limit to their number: and though the methods of which\r\nwe have spoken do theoretically enable us to calculate as many terms\r\nas we please, the labor and the complexity of the operations are so\r\nserious that common calculators are stopped by them. None but very\r\ngreat mathematicians have been able to walk safely any considerable\r\ndistance into this avenue,--so rapidly does it darken as we proceed.\r\nAnd even the possibility of doing what has been done, depends upon\r\nwhat we may call accidental circumstances; the smallness of the\r\ninclinations and eccentricities of the system, and the like. \"If\r\nnature had not favored us in this way,\" Lagrange used to say, \"there\r\nwould have been an end of the geometers in this problem.\" The\r\nexpected return of the comet of 1682 in 1759, gave a new interest to\r\nthe problem, and Clairaut proceeded to calculate the case which was\r\nthus suggested. When this was treated by the methods which had\r\nsucceeded for the moon, it offered no prospect of success, in\r\nconsequence of the absence of the favorable circumstances just\r\nreferred to, and, accordingly, Clairaut, after obtaining the six\r\nequations to which he reduces the solution,[49\\6] adds, \"Integrate\r\nthem who can\" (Intègre maintenant qui pourra). New methods of\r\napproximation were devised for this case.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\6: _Journal des Sçavans_, Aug. 1759.]\r\n\r\nThe problem of three bodies was not prosecuted in consequence of its\r\nanalytical beauty, or its intrinsic attraction; but its great\r\ndifficulties were thus resolutely combated from necessity; because\r\nin no other way could the theory of universal gravitation be known\r\nto be true or made to be useful. The construction of _Tables of the\r\nMoon_, an object which offered a large pecuniary reward, as well as\r\nmathematical glory, to the successful adventurer, was the main\r\npurpose of these labors.\r\n\r\nThe _Theory of the Planets_ presented the Problem of Three Bodies in\r\na new form, and involved in peculiar difficulties; for the {370}\r\napproximations which succeed in the Lunar theory fail here.\r\nArtifices somewhat modified are required to overcome the\r\ndifficulties of this case.\r\n\r\nEuler had investigated, in particular, the motions of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, in which there was a secular acceleration and retardation,\r\nknown by observation, but not easily explicable by theory. Euler's\r\nmemoirs, which gained the prize of the French Academy, in 1748 and\r\n1752, contained much beautiful analysis; and Lagrange published also\r\na theory of Jupiter and Saturn, in which he obtained results\r\ndifferent from those of Euler. Laplace, in 1787, showed that this\r\ninequality arose from the circumstance that two of Saturn's years\r\nare very nearly equal to five of Jupiter's.\r\n\r\nThe problems relating to Jupiter's _Satellites_, were found to be\r\neven more complex than those which refer to the planets: for it was\r\nnecessary to consider each satellite as disturbed by the other three\r\nat once; and thus there occurred the Problem of _Five_ Bodies. This\r\nproblem was resolved by Lagrange.[50\\6]\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\6: Bailly, _Ast. Mod._ iii. 178.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the newly-discovered _small Planets_, Juno, Ceres, Vesta,\r\nPallas, whose orbits almost coincide with each other, and are more\r\ninclined and more eccentric than those of the ancient planets, give\r\nrise, by their perturbations, to new forms of the problem, and\r\nrequire new artifices.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these researches respecting Jupiter, Lagrange and\r\nLaplace were led to consider particularly the _secular Inequalities_\r\nof the solar system; that is, those inequalities in which the duration\r\nof the cycle of change embraces very many revolutions of the bodies\r\nthemselves. Euler in 1749 and 1755, and Lagrange[51\\6] in 1766, had\r\nintroduced the method of the _Variation of the Elements_ of the orbit;\r\nwhich consists in tracing the effect of the perturbing forces, not as\r\ndirectly altering the place of the planet, but as producing a change\r\nfrom one instant to another, in the dimensions and position of the\r\nElliptical orbit which the planet describes.[52\\6] Taking this view,\r\nhe {371} determines the secular changes of each of the _elements_ or\r\ndetermining quantities of the orbit. In 1773, Laplace also attacked\r\nthis subject of secular changes, and obtained expressions for them. On\r\nthis occasion, he proved the celebrated proposition that, \"the mean\r\nmotions of the planets are invariable:\" that is, that there is, in the\r\nrevolutions of the system, no progressive change which is not finally\r\nstopped and reversed; no increase, which is not, after some period,\r\nchanged into decrease; no retardation which is not at last succeeded\r\nby acceleration; although, in some cases, millions of years may elapse\r\nbefore the system reaches the turning-point. Thomas Simpson noticed\r\nthe same consequence of the laws of universal attraction. In 1774 and\r\n1776, Lagrange[53\\6] still labored at the secular equations; extending\r\nhis researches to the nodes and inclinations; and showed that the\r\ninvariability of the mean motions of the planets, which Laplace had\r\nproved, neglecting the fourth powers of the eccentricities and\r\ninclinations of the orbits,[54\\6] was true, however far the\r\napproximation was carried, so long as the squares of the disturbing\r\nmasses were neglected. He afterwards improved his methods;[55\\6] and,\r\nin 1783, he endeavored to extend the calculation of the changes of the\r\nelements to the periodical equations, as well as the secular.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\6: Gautier, _Prob. de Trois Corps_, p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\6: In the first edition of this History, I had ascribed to\r\nLagrange the invention of the Method of Variation of Elements in the\r\ntheory of Perturbations. But justice to Euler requires that we should\r\nassign this distinction to him; at least, next to Newton, whose mode\r\nof representing the paths of bodies by means of a _Revolving Orbit_,\r\nin the Ninth Section of the _Principia_, may be considered as an\r\nanticipation of the method of variation of elements. In the fifth\r\nvolume of the _Mécanique Céleste_, livre xv. p. 305, is an abstract of\r\nEuler's paper of 1749; where Laplace adds, \"C'est le premier essai de\r\nla méthode de la variation des constantes arbitraires.\" And in page\r\n310 is an abstract of the paper of 1756: and speaking of the method,\r\nLaplace says, \"It consists in regarding the elements of the elliptical\r\nmotion as variable in virtue of the perturbing forces. Those elements\r\nare, 1, the axis major; 2, the epoch of the body being at the apse; 3,\r\nthe eccentricity; 4, the movement of the apse; 5, the inclination; 6,\r\nthe longitude of the node;\" and he then proceeds to show how Euler did\r\nthis. It is possible that Lagrange knew nothing of Euler's paper. See\r\n_Méc. Cél._ vol. v. p. 312. But Euler's conception and treatment of\r\nthe method are complete, so that he must be looked upon as the author\r\nof it.]\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\6: Gautier, p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\6: Ib. p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\6: Ib. p. 196.]\r\n\r\n8. _Mécanique Céleste_, _&c._--Laplace also resumed the\r\nconsideration of the secular changes; and, finally, undertook his\r\nvast work, the _Mécanique Céleste_, which he intended to contain a\r\ncomplete view of the existing state of this splendid department of\r\nscience. We may see, in the exultation which the author obviously\r\nfeels at the thought of erecting this monument of his age, the\r\nenthusiasm which had been excited by the splendid course of\r\nmathematical successes of which I have given a sketch. The two first\r\nvolumes of this great work appeared in 1799. The third and fourth\r\nvolumes were published in 1802 and 1805 respectively. Since its\r\npublication, little has been added to the solution of the great\r\nproblems of which it treats. In 1808, Laplace presented to the\r\nFrench Bureau des Longitudes, a Supplement to the _Mécanique\r\nCéleste_; the object of which was to improve still further {372} the\r\nmode of obtaining the secular variations of the elements. Poisson\r\nand Lagrange proved the invariability of the major axes of the\r\norbits, as far as the second order of the perturbing forces. Various\r\nother authors have since labored at this subject. Burckhardt, in\r\n1808, extended the perturbing function as far as the sixth order of\r\nthe eccentricities. Gauss, Hansen, and Bessel, Ivory, MM. Lubbock,\r\nPlana, Pontécoulant, and Airy, have, at different periods up to the\r\npresent time, either extended or illustrated some particular part of\r\nthe theory, or applied it to special cases; as in the instance of\r\nProfessor Airy's calculation of an inequality of Venus and the\r\nearth, of which the period is 240 years. The approximation of the\r\nMoon's motions has been pushed to an almost incredible extent by M.\r\nDamoiseau, and, finally, Plana has once more attempted to present,\r\nin a single work (three thick quarto volumes), all that has hitherto\r\nbeen executed with regard to the theory of the Moon.\r\n\r\nI give only the leading points of the progress of analytical\r\ndynamics. Hence I have not spoken in detail of the theory of the\r\nSatellites of Jupiter, a subject on which Lagrange gained a prize\r\nfor a Memoir, in 1766, and in which Laplace discovered some most\r\ncurious properties in 1784. Still less have I referred to the purely\r\nspeculative question of _Tautochronous Curves_ in a resisting\r\nmedium, though it was a subject of the labors of Bernoulli, Euler,\r\nFontaine, D'Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace. The reader will rightly\r\nsuppose that many other curious investigations are passed over in\r\nutter silence.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [Although the analytical calculations of the great\r\nmathematicians of the last century had determined, in a\r\ndemonstrative manner, a vast series of inequalities to which the\r\nmotions of the sun, moon, and planets were subject in virtue of\r\ntheir mutual attraction, there were still unsatisfactory points in\r\nthe solutions thus given of the great mechanical problems suggested\r\nby the System of the Universe. One of these points was the want of\r\nany evident mechanical significance in the successive members of\r\nthese series. Lindenau relates that Lagrange, near the end of his\r\nlife, expressed his sorrow that the methods of approximation\r\nemployed in Physical Astronomy rested on arbitrary processes, and\r\nnot on any insight into the results of mechanical action. But\r\nsomething was subsequently done to remove the ground of this\r\ncomplaint. In 1818, Gauss pointed out that secular equations may be\r\nconceived to result from the disturbing body being distributed along\r\nits orbit so as to form a ring, and thus made the result conceivable\r\nmore distinctly than as a mere result of calculation. And it appears\r\n{373} to me that Professor Airy's treatise entitled _Gravitation_,\r\npublished at Cambridge in 1834, is of great value in supplying\r\nsimilar modes of conception with regard to the mechanical origin of\r\nmany of the principal inequalities of the solar system.\r\n\r\nBessel in 1824, and Hansen in 1828, published works which are\r\nconsidered as belonging, along with those of Gauss, to a new era in\r\nphysical astronomy.[56\\6] Gauss's _Theoria Motuum Corporum\r\nCelestium_, which had Lalande's medal assigned to it by the French\r\nInstitute, had already (1810) resolved all problems concerning the\r\ndetermination of the place of a planet or comet in its orbit in\r\nfunction of the elements. The value of Hansen's labors respecting\r\nthe Perturbations of the Planets was recognized by the Astronomical\r\nSociety of London, which awarded to them its gold medal.\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\6: _Abhand. der Akad. d. Wissensch. zu Berlin_. 1824; and\r\n_Disquisitiones circa Theoriam Perturbationum_. See Jahn. _Gesch.\r\nder Astron._ p. 84.]\r\n\r\nThe investigations of M. Damoiseau, and of MM. Plana and Carlini, on\r\nthe Problem of the Lunar Theory, followed nearly the same course as\r\nthose of their predecessors. In these, as in the _Mécanique Céleste_\r\nand in preceding works on the same subject, the Moon's co-ordinates\r\n(time, radius vector, and latitude) were expressed in function of\r\nher true longitude. The integrations were effected in series, and\r\nthen by reversion of the series, the longitude was expressed in\r\nfunction of the time; and then in the same manner the other two\r\nco-ordinates. But Sir John Lubbock and M. Pontécoulant have made the\r\n_mean_ longitude of the moon, that is, the time, the independent\r\nvariable, and have expressed the moon's co-ordinates in terms of\r\nsines and cosines of angles increasing proportionally to the time.\r\nAnd this method has been adopted by M. Poisson (_Mem. Inst._ xiii.\r\n1835, p. 212). M. Damoiseau, like Laplace and Clairaut, had deduced\r\nthe successive coefficients of the lunar inequalities by numerical\r\nequations. But M. Plana expresses explicitly each coefficient in\r\ngeneral terms of the letters expressing the constants of the\r\nproblem, arranging them according to the order of the quantities,\r\nand substituting numbers at the end of the operation only. By\r\nattending to this arrangement, MM. Lubbock and Pontécoulant have\r\nverified or corrected a large portion of the terms contained in the\r\ninvestigations of MM. Damoiseau and Plana. Sir John Lubbock has\r\ncalculated the polar co-ordinates of the Moon directly; M. Poisson,\r\non the other hand, has obtained the variable elliptical elements; M.\r\nPontécoulant conceives that the method of variation or arbitrary\r\n{374} constants may most conveniently be reserved for secular\r\ninequalities and inequalities of long periods.\r\n\r\nMM. Lubbock and Pontécoulant have made the mode of treating the\r\nLunar Theory and the Planetary Theory agree with each other, instead\r\nof following two different paths in the calculation of the two\r\nproblems, which had previously been done.\r\n\r\nProf. Hansen, also, in his _Fundamenta Nova Investigationis Orbitæ\r\nveræ quam Luna perlustrat_ (_Gothæ_, 1838), gives a general method,\r\nincluding the Lunar Theory and the Planetary Theory as two special\r\ncases. To this is annexed a solution of the _Problem of Four Bodies_.\r\n\r\nI am here speaking of the Lunar and Planetary Theories as Mechanical\r\nProblems only. Connected with this subject, I will not omit to\r\nnotice a very general and beautiful method of solving problems\r\nrespecting the motion of systems **of mutually attracting bodies,\r\ngiven by Sir W. R. Hamilton, in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for\r\n1834-5 (\"On a General Method in Dynamics\"). His method consists in\r\ninvestigating the _Principal Function_ of the co-ordinates of the\r\nbodies: this function being one, by the differentiation of which,\r\nthe co-ordinates of the bodies of the system may be found. Moreover,\r\nan approximate value of this function being obtained, the same\r\nformulæ supply a means of successive approximation without limit.]\r\n\r\n9. _Precession. Motion of Rigid Bodies._--The series of\r\ninvestigations of which I have spoken, extensive and complex as it\r\nis, treats the moving bodies as points only, and takes no account of\r\nany peculiarity of their form or motion of their parts. The\r\ninvestigation of the motion of a body of any magnitude and form, is\r\nanother branch of analytical mechanics, which well deserves notice.\r\nLike the former branch, it mainly owed its cultivation to the\r\nproblems suggested by the solar system. Newton, as we have seen,\r\nendeavored to calculate the effect of the attraction of the sun and\r\nmoon in producing the _precession of the equinoxes_; but in doing\r\nthis he made some mistakes. In 1747, D'Alembert solved this problem\r\nby the aid of his \"Principle;\" and it was not difficult for him to\r\nshow, as he did in his _Opuscules_, in 1761, that the same method\r\nenabled him to determine the motion of a body of any figure acted\r\nupon by any forces. But, as the reader will have observed in the\r\ncourse of this narrative, the great mathematicians of this period\r\nwere always nearly abreast of each other in their\r\nadvances.--Euler,[57\\6] in the mean time, had published, in 1751, a\r\nsolution of the {375} problem of the precession; and in 1752, a\r\nmemoir which he entitled _Discovery of a New Principle of\r\nMechanics_, and which contains a solution of the general problem of\r\nthe alteration of rotary motion by forces. D'Alembert noticed with\r\ndisapprobation the assumption of priority which this title implied,\r\nthough allowing the merit of the memoir. Various improvements were\r\nmade in these solutions; but the final form was given them by Euler;\r\nand they were applied to a great variety of problems in his _Theory\r\nof the Motion of Solid and Rigid Bodies_, which was written[58\\6]\r\nabout 1760, and published in 1765. The formulæ in this work were\r\nmuch simplified by the use of a discovery of Segner, that every body\r\nhas three axes which were called Principal Axes, about which alone\r\n(in general) it would permanently revolve. The equations which Euler\r\nand other writers had obtained, were attacked as erroneous by Landen\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions for 1785; but I think it is\r\nimpossible to consider this criticism otherwise than as an example\r\nof the inability of the English mathematicians of that period to\r\ntake a steady hold of the analytical generalizations to which the\r\ngreat Continental authors had been led. Perhaps one of the most\r\nremarkable calculations of the motion of a rigid body is that which\r\nLagrange performed with regard to the _Moon's Libration_; and by\r\nwhich he showed that the Nodes of the Moon's Equator and those of\r\nher Orbit must always coincide.\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\6: _Ac. Berl._ 1745, 1750.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\6: See the preface to the book.]\r\n\r\n10. _Vibrating Strings._--Other mechanical questions, unconnected\r\nwith astronomy, were also pursued with great zeal and success. Among\r\nthese was the problem of a vibrating string, stretched between two\r\nfixed points. There is not much complexity in the mechanical\r\nconceptions which belong to this case, but considerable difficulty\r\nin reducing them to analysis. Taylor, in his _Method of Increments_,\r\npublished in 1716, had annexed to his work a solution of this\r\nproblem; obtained on suppositions, limited indeed, but apparently\r\nconformable to the most common circumstances of practice. John\r\nBernoulli, in 1728, had also treated the same problem. But it\r\nassumed an interest altogether new, when, in 1747, D'Alembert\r\npublished his views on the subject; in which he maintained that,\r\ninstead of one kind of curve only, there were an infinite number of\r\ndifferent curves, which answered the conditions of the question. The\r\nproblem, thus put forward by one great mathematician, was, as usual,\r\ntaken up by the others, whose names the reader is now so familiar\r\nwith in such an association. In {376} 1748, Euler not only assented\r\nto the generalization of D'Alembert, but held that it was not\r\nnecessary that the curves so introduced should be defined by any\r\nalgebraical condition whatever. From this extreme indeterminateness\r\nD'Alembert dissented; while Daniel Bernoulli, trusting more to\r\nphysical and less to analytical reasonings, maintained that both\r\nthese generalizations were inapplicable in fact, and that the\r\nsolution was really restricted, as had at first been supposed, to\r\nthe form of the trochoid, and to other forms derivable from that. He\r\nintroduced, in such problems, the \"Law of Coexistent Vibrations,\"\r\nwhich is of eminent use in enabling us to conceive the results of\r\ncomplex mechanical conditions, and the real import of many\r\nanalytical expressions. In the mean time, the wonderful analytical\r\ngenius of Lagrange had applied itself to this problem. He had formed\r\nthe Academy of Turin, in conjunction with his friends Saluces and\r\nCigna; and the first memoir in their Transactions was one by him on\r\nthis subject: in this and in subsequent writings he has established,\r\nto the satisfaction of the mathematical world, that the functions\r\nintroduced in such cases are not necessarily continuous, but are\r\narbitrary to the same degree that the motion is so practically;\r\nthough capable of expression by a series of circular functions. This\r\ncontroversy, concerning the degree of lawlessness with which the\r\nconditions of the solution may be assumed, is of consequence, not\r\nonly with respect to vibrating strings, but also with respect to\r\nmany problems, belonging to a branch of Mechanics which we now have\r\nto mention, the Doctrine of Fluids.\r\n\r\n11. _Equilibrium of Fluids. Figure of the Earth. Tides._--The\r\napplication of the general doctrines of Mechanics to fluids was a\r\nnatural and inevitable step, when the principles of the science had\r\nbeen generalized. It was easily seen that a fluid is, for this\r\npurpose, nothing more than a body of which the parts are movable\r\namongst each other with entire facility; and that the mathematician\r\nmust trace the consequences of this condition upon his equations.\r\nThis accordingly was done, by the founders of mechanics, both for\r\nthe cases of the equilibrium and of motion. Newton's attempt to\r\nsolve the problem of the _figure of the earth_, supposing it fluid,\r\nis the first example of such an investigation: and this solution\r\nrested upon principles which we have already explained, applied with\r\nthe skill and sagacity which distinguished all that Newton did.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the generality of the principle, that\r\nfluids press equally in all directions, was established. In applying\r\nit to calculation, Newton took for his fundamental principle, the\r\nequal {377} weight of columns of the fluid reaching to the centre;\r\nHuyghens took, as his basis, the **perpendicularity of the resulting\r\nforce at each point to the surface of the fluid; Bouguer conceived\r\nthat both principles were necessary; and Clairaut showed that the\r\nequilibrium of _all_ canals is requisite. He also was the first\r\nmathematician who deduced from this principle the Equations of\r\nPartial Differentials by which these laws are expressed; a step\r\nwhich, as Lagrange says,[59\\6] changed the face of Hydrostatics, and\r\nmade it a new science. Euler simplified the mode of obtaining the\r\nEquations of Equilibrium for any forces whatever; and put them in\r\nthe form which is now generally adopted in our treatises.\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\6: _Méc. Analyt._ ii. p. 180.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the _Tides_, in the way in which Newton attempted\r\nit in the third book of the _Principia_, is another example of a\r\nhydrostatical investigation: for he considered only the form that\r\nthe ocean would have if it were at rest. The memoirs of Maclaurin,\r\nDaniel Bernoulli, and Euler, on the question of the Tides, which\r\nshared among them the prize of the Academy of Sciences in 1740, went\r\nupon the same views.\r\n\r\nThe _Treatise of the Figure of the Earth_, by Clairaut, in 1743,\r\nextended Newton's solution of the same problem, by supposing a solid\r\nnucleus covered with a fluid of different density. No peculiar\r\nnovelty has been introduced into this subject, except a method\r\nemployed by Laplace for determining the attractions of spheroids of\r\nsmall eccentricity, which is, as Professor Airy has said,[60\\6] \"a\r\ncalculus the most singular in its nature, and the most powerful in\r\nits effects, of any which has yet appeared.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\6: _Enc. Met._ Fig. of Earth, p. 192.]\r\n\r\n12. _Capillary Action._--There is only one other problem of the\r\nstatics of fluids on which it is necessary to say a word,--the\r\ndoctrine of Capillary Attraction. Daniel Bernoulli,[61\\6] in 1738,\r\nstates that he passes over the subject, because he could not reduce\r\nthe facts to general laws: but Clairaut was more successful, and\r\nLaplace and Poisson have since given great analytical completeness to\r\nhis theory. At present our business is, not so much with the\r\nsufficiency of the theory to explain phenomena, as with the mechanical\r\nproblem of which this is an example, which is one of a very remarkable\r\nand important character; namely, to determine the effect of\r\nattractions which are exercised by all the particles of bodies, on the\r\nhypothesis that the {378} attraction of each particle, though sensible\r\nwhen it acts upon another particle at an extremely small distance from\r\nit, becomes insensible and vanishes the moment this distance assumes a\r\nperceptible magnitude. It may easily be imagined that the analysis by\r\nwhich results are obtained under conditions so general and so\r\npeculiar, is curious and abstract; the problem has been resolved in\r\nsome very extensive cases.\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\6: _Hydrodyn._ Pref. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n13. _Motion of Fluids._--The only branch of mathematical mechanics\r\nwhich remains to be considered, is that which is, we may venture to\r\nsay, hitherto incomparably the most incomplete of\r\nall,--Hydrodynamics. It may easily be imagined that the mere\r\nhypothesis of absolute relative mobility in the parts, combined with\r\nthe laws of motion and nothing more, are conditions too vague and\r\ngeneral to lead to definite conclusions. Yet such are the conditions\r\nof the problems which relate to the motion of fluids. Accordingly,\r\nthe mode of solving them has been, to introduce certain other\r\nhypotheses, often acknowledged to be false, and almost always in\r\nsome measure arbitrary, which may assist in determining and\r\nobtaining the solution. The Velocity of a fluid issuing from an\r\norifice in a vessel, and the Resistance which a solid body suffers\r\nin moving in a fluid, have been the two main problems on which\r\nmathematicians have employed themselves. We have already spoken of\r\nthe manner in which Newton attacked both these, and endeavored to\r\nconnect them. The subject became a branch of Analytical Mechanics by\r\nthe labors of D. Bernoulli, whose _Hydrodynamica_ was published in\r\n1738. This work rests upon the Huyghenian principle of which we have\r\nalready spoken in the history of the centre of oscillation; namely,\r\nthe equality of the _actual descent_ of the particles and the\r\n_potential ascent_; or, in other words, the conservation of _vis\r\nviva_. This was the first analytical treatise; and the analysis is\r\ndeclared by Lagrange to be as elegant in its steps as it is simple\r\nin its results. Maclaurin also treated the subject; but is accused\r\nof reasoning in such a way as to show that he had determined upon\r\nhis result beforehand; and the method of John Bernoulli, who\r\nlikewise wrote upon it, has been strongly objected to by D'Alembert.\r\nD'Alembert himself applied the principle which bears his name to\r\nthis subject; publishing a _Treatise on the Equilibrium and Motion\r\nof Fluids_ in 1744, and on the _Resistance of Fluids_ in 1753. His\r\n_Réflexions sur la Cause Générale des Vents_, printed in 1747, are\r\nalso a celebrated work, belonging to this part of mathematics.\r\nEuler, in this as in other cases, was one of those who most\r\ncontributed to give analytical elegance to the subject. In addition\r\nto the questions which {379} have been mentioned, he and Lagrange\r\ntreated the problems of the small vibrations of fluids, both\r\ninelastic and elastic;--a subject which leads, like the question of\r\nvibrating strings, to some subtle and abstruse considerations\r\nconcerning the significations of the integrals of partial\r\ndifferential equations. Laplace also took up the subject of waves\r\npropagated along the surface of water; and deduced a very celebrated\r\ntheory of the tides, in which he considered the ocean to be, not in\r\nequilibrium, as preceding writers had supposed, but agitated by a\r\nconstant series of undulations, produced by the solar and lunar\r\nforces. The difficulty of such an investigation may be judged of\r\nfrom this, that Laplace, in order to carry it on, is obliged to\r\nassume a mechanical proposition, unproved, and only conjectured to\r\nbe true; namely,[62\\6] that, \"in a system of bodies acted upon by\r\nforces which are periodical, the state of the system is periodical\r\nlike the forces.\" Even with this assumption, various other arbitrary\r\nprocesses are requisite; and it appears still very doubtful whether\r\nLaplace's theory is either a better mechanical solution of the\r\nproblem, or a nearer approximation to the laws of the phenomena,\r\nthan that obtained by D. Bernoulli, following the views of Newton.\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\6: _Méc. Cél._ t. ii. p. 218.]\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the solutions of problems of hydrodynamics are not\r\nsatisfactorily confirmed by the results of observation. Poisson and\r\nCauchy have prosecuted the subject of waves, and have deduced very\r\ncurious conclusions by a very recondite and profound analysis. The\r\nassumptions of the mathematician here do not represent the\r\nconditions of nature; the rules of theory, therefore, are not a good\r\nstandard to which we may refer the aberrations of particular cases;\r\nand the laws which we obtain from experiment are very imperfectly\r\nillustrated by _à priori_ calculation. The case of this department\r\nof knowledge, Hydrodynamics, is very peculiar; we have reached the\r\nhighest point of the science,--the laws of extreme simplicity and\r\ngenerality from which the phenomena flow; we cannot doubt that the\r\nultimate principles which we have obtained are the true ones, and\r\nthose which really apply to the facts; and yet we are far from being\r\nable to apply the principles to explain or find out the facts. In\r\norder to do this, we want, in addition to what we have, true and\r\nuseful principles, intermediate between the highest and the\r\nlowest;--between the extreme and almost barren generality of the\r\nlaws of motion, and the endless varieties and inextricable\r\ncomplexity of fluid motions in special cases. {380} The reason of\r\nthis peculiarity in the science of Hydrodynamics appears to be, that\r\nits general principles were not discovered with reference to the\r\nscience itself, but by extension from the sister science of the\r\nMechanics of Solids; they were not obtained by ascending gradually\r\nfrom particulars, to truths more and more general, respecting the\r\nmotions of fluids; but were caught at once, by a perception that the\r\nparts of fluids are included in that range of generality which we\r\nare entitled to give to the supreme laws of motions of solids. Thus,\r\nSolid Dynamics and Fluid Dynamics resemble two edifices which have\r\ntheir highest apartment in common, and though we can explore every\r\npart of the former building, we have not yet succeeded in traversing\r\nthe staircase of the latter, either from the top or from the bottom.\r\nIf we had lived in a world in which there were no solid bodies, we\r\nshould probably not have yet discovered the laws of motion; if we\r\nhad lived in a world in which there were no fluids, we should have\r\nno idea how insufficient a complete possession of the general laws\r\nof motion may be, to give us a true knowledge of particular results.\r\n\r\n14. _Various General Mechanical Principles._--The generalized laws\r\nof motion, the points to which I have endeavored to conduct my\r\nhistory, include in them all other laws by which the motions of\r\nbodies can be regulated; and among such, several laws which had been\r\ndiscovered before the highest point of generalization was reached,\r\nand which thus served as stepping-stones to the ultimate principles.\r\nSuch were, as we have seen, the Principles of the Conservation of\r\n_vis viva_, the Principle of the Conservation of the Motion of the\r\nCentre of Gravity, and the like. These principles may, of course, be\r\ndeduced from our elementary laws, and were finally established by\r\nmathematicians on that footing. There are other principles which may\r\nbe similarly demonstrated; among the rest, I may mention the\r\nPrinciple of _the Conservation of areas_, which extends to any\r\nnumber of bodies a law analogous to that which Kepler had observed,\r\nand Newton demonstrated, respecting the areas described by each\r\nplanet round the sun. I may mention also, the Principle of the\r\n_Immobility of the plane of maximum areas_, a plane which is not\r\ndisturbed by any mutual action of the parts of any system. The\r\nformer of these principles was published about the same time by\r\nEuler, D. Bernoulli, and Darcy, under different forms, in 1746 and\r\n1747; the latter by Laplace.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added a law, very celebrated in its time, and the\r\noccasion of an angry controversy, _the Principle of least action_.\r\n{381} Maupertuis conceived that he could establish _à priori_, by\r\ntheological arguments, that all mechanical changes must take place\r\nin the world so as to occasion the least possible quantity of\r\n_action_. In asserting this, it was proposed to measure the Action\r\nby the product of Velocity and Space; and this measure being\r\nadopted, the mathematicians, though they did not generally assent to\r\nMaupertuis' reasonings, found that his principle expressed a\r\nremarkable and useful truth, which might be established on known\r\nmechanical grounds.\r\n\r\n15. _Analytical Generality. Connection of Statics and\r\nDynamics._--Before I quit this subject, it is important to remark\r\nthe peculiar character which the science of Mechanics has now\r\nassumed, in consequence of the extreme analytical generality which\r\nhas been given it. Symbols, and operations upon symbols, include the\r\nwhole of the reasoner's task; and though the relations of space are\r\nthe leading subjects in the science, the great analytical treatises\r\nupon it do not contain a single diagram. The _Mécanique Analytique_\r\nof Lagrange, of which the first edition appeared in 1788, is by far\r\nthe most consummate example of this analytical generality. \"The plan\r\nof this work,\" says the author, \"is entirely new. I have proposed to\r\nmyself to reduce the whole theory of this science, and the art of\r\nresolving the problems which it includes, to general formulæ, of\r\nwhich the simple development gives all the equations necessary for\r\nthe solution of the problem.\"--\"The reader will find no figures in\r\nthe work. The methods which I deliver do not require either\r\nconstructions, or geometrical or mechanical reasonings; but only\r\nalgebraical operations, subject to a regular and uniform rule of\r\nproceeding.\" Thus this writer makes Mechanics a branch of Analysis;\r\ninstead of making, as had previously been done, Analysis an\r\nimplement of Mechanics.[63\\6] The transcendent generalizing genius\r\nof Lagrange, and his matchless analytical skill and elegance, have\r\nmade this undertaking as successful as it is striking.\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\6: Lagrange himself terms Mechanics, \"An Analytical\r\nGeometry of four dimensions.\" Besides the _three co-ordinates_ which\r\ndetermine the place of a body in _space_, the _time_ enters as a\r\n_fourth co-ordinate_. [Note by Littrow.]]\r\n\r\nThe mathematical reader is aware that the language of mathematical\r\nsymbols is, in its nature, more general than the language of words:\r\nand that in this way truths, translated into symbols, often suggest\r\ntheir own generalizations. Something of this kind has happened in\r\nMechanics. The same Formula expresses the general condition of\r\nStatics and that of Dynamics. The tendency to generalization which\r\nis thus introduced by analysis, makes mathematicians unwilling to\r\n{382} acknowledge a plurality of Mechanical principles; and in the\r\nmost recent analytical treatises on the subject, all the doctrines\r\nare deduced from the single Law of Inertia. Indeed, if we identify\r\nForces with the Velocities which produce them, and allow the\r\nComposition of Forces to be applicable to force _so understood_, it\r\nis easy to see that we can reduce the Laws of Motion to the\r\nPrinciples of Statics; and this conjunction, though it may not be\r\nconsidered as philosophically just, is verbally correct. If we thus\r\nmultiply or extend the meanings of the term Force, we make our\r\nelementary principles simpler and fewer than before; and those\r\npersons, therefore, who are willing to assent to such a use of\r\nwords, can thus obtain an additional generalisation of dynamical\r\nprinciples; and this, as I have stated, has been adopted in several\r\nrecent treatises. I shall not further discuss here how far this is a\r\nreal advance in science.\r\n\r\nHaving thus rapidly gone through the history of Force and Attraction\r\nin the abstract, we return to the attempt to interpret the phenomena\r\nof the universe by the aid of these abstractions thus established.\r\n\r\nBut before we do so, we may make one remark on the history of this\r\npart of science. In consequence of the vast career into which the\r\nDoctrine of Motion has been drawn by the splendid problems proposed to\r\nit by Astronomy, the origin and starting-point of Mechanics, namely\r\nMachines, had almost been lost out of sight. _Machines_ had become the\r\nsmallest part of _Mechanics_, as _Land-measuring_ had become the\r\nsmallest part of _Geometry_. Yet the application of Mathematics to the\r\ndoctrine of Machines has led, at all periods of the Science, and\r\nespecially in our own time, to curious and valuable results. Some of\r\nthese will be noticed in the _Additions_ to this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{383}}\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICAL SCIENCES.\r\n(CONTINUED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF\r\nPHYSICAL ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DESCEND from heaven, Urania, by that name\r\n  If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine\r\n  Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,\r\n  Above the flight of Pegasean wing.\r\n  The meaning, not the name, I call, for thou\r\n  Nor of the muses nine, nor on the top\r\n  Of old Olympus dwell'st: but heavenly-born,\r\n  Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,\r\n  Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse,\r\n  Wisdom, thy sister.\r\n\r\n          _Paradise Lost_, B. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{385}}\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE INDUCTIVE EPOCH OF NEWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have now to contemplate the last and most splendid period of the\r\nprogress of Astronomy;--the grand completion of the history of the\r\nmost ancient and prosperous province of human knowledge;--the steps\r\nwhich elevated this science to an unrivalled eminence above other\r\nsciences;--the first great example of a wide and complex assemblage\r\nof phenomena indubitably traced to their single simple cause;--in\r\nshort, the first example of the formation of a perfect Inductive\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in other considerable advances in real science, the\r\ncomplete disclosure of the new truths by the principal discoverer,\r\nwas preceded by movements and glimpses, by trials, seekings, and\r\nguesses on the part of others; by indications, in short, that men's\r\nminds were already carried by their intellectual impulses in the\r\ndirection in which the truth lay, and were beginning to detect its\r\nnature. In a case so important and interesting as this, it is more\r\npeculiarly proper to give some view of this Prelude to the Epoch of\r\nthe full discovery.\r\n\r\n(_Francis Bacon._) That Astronomy should become Physical\r\nAstronomy,--that the motions of the heavenly bodies should be traced\r\nto their causes, as well as reduced to rule,--was felt by all\r\npersons of active and philosophical minds as a pressing and\r\nirresistible need, at the time of which we speak. We have already\r\nseen how much this feeling had to do in impelling Kepler to the\r\ntrain of laborious research by which he made his discoveries.\r\nPerhaps it may be interesting to point out how strongly this\r\npersuasion of the necessity of giving a physical character to\r\nastronomy, had taken possession of the mind of Bacon, who, looking\r\nat the progress of knowledge with a more comprehensive spirit, and\r\nfrom a higher point of view than Kepler, could have none of his\r\nastronomical prejudices, since on that subject he was of a different\r\nschool, and of far inferior knowledge. In his \"Description of the\r\nIntellectual Globe,\" Bacon says that while Astronomy had, up to that\r\ntime, had it for her business to inquire into the rules of the\r\nheavenly motions, and Philosophy into their causes, they had both so\r\nfar worked without due appreciation of their respective tasks;\r\nPhilosophy neglecting facts, and Astronomy claiming assent to her\r\n{386} mathematical hypotheses, which ought to be considered as mere\r\nsteps of calculation. \"Since, therefore,\" he continues,[1\\7] \"each\r\nscience has hitherto been a slight and ill-constructed thing, we\r\nmust assuredly take a firmer stand; our ground being, that these two\r\nsubjects, which on account of the narrowness of men's views and the\r\ntraditions of professors have been so long dissevered, are, in fact,\r\none and the same thing, and compose one body of science.\" It must be\r\nallowed that, however erroneous might be the points of Bacon's\r\npositive astronomical creed, these general views of the nature and\r\nposition of the science are most sound and philosophical.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\7: Vol. ix. 221.]\r\n\r\n(_Kepler_) In his attempts to suggest a right physical view of the\r\nstarry heavens and their relation to the earth, Bacon failed, along\r\nwith all the writers of his time. It has already been stated that\r\nthe main cause of this failure was the want of a knowledge of the\r\ntrue theory of motion;--the non-existence of the science of\r\nDynamics. At the time of Bacon and Kepler, it was only just\r\nbeginning to be possible to reduce the heavenly motions to the laws\r\nof earthly motion, because the latter were only just then divulged.\r\nAccordingly, we have seen that the whole of Kepler's physical\r\nspeculations proceed upon an ignorance of the first law of motion,\r\nand assume it to be the main problem of the physical astronomer to\r\nassign the cause which _keeps up_ the motions of the planets.\r\nKepler's doctrine is, that a certain Force or Virtue resides in the\r\nsun, by which all bodies within his influence are carried round him.\r\nHe illustrates[2\\7] the nature of this Virtue in various ways,\r\ncomparing it to Light, and to the Magnetic Power, which it resembles\r\nin the circumstances of operating at a distance, and also in\r\nexercising a feebler influence as the distance becomes greater. But\r\nit was obvious that these comparisons were very imperfect; for they\r\ndo not explain how the sun produces in a body at a distance a motion\r\n_athwart_ the line of emanation; and though Kepler introduced an\r\nassumed rotation of the sun on his axis as the cause of this effect,\r\nthat such a cause could produce the result could not be established\r\nby any analogy of terrestrial motions. But another image to which he\r\nreferred, suggested a much more substantial and conceivable kind of\r\nmechanical action by which the celestial motions might be produced,\r\nnamely, a current of fluid matter circulating round the sun, and\r\ncarrying the planet with it, like a boat in a stream. In the Table\r\nof Contents of the work on the planet Mars, the purport of the\r\nchapter to which I have alluded is {387} stated as follows: \"A\r\nphysical speculation, in which it is demonstrated that the vehicle\r\nof that Virtue which urges the planets, circulates through the\r\nspaces of the universe after the manner of a river or whirlpool\r\n(_vortex_), moving quicker than the planets.\" I think it will be\r\nfound, by any one who reads Kepler's phrases concerning the _moving\r\nforce,--the magnetic nature,--the immaterial virtue_ of the sun,\r\nthat they convey no distinct conception, except so far as they are\r\ninterpreted by the expressions just quoted. A vortex of fluid\r\nconstantly whirling round the sun, kept in this whirling motion by\r\nthe rotation of the sun himself, and carrying the planets round the\r\nsun by its revolution, as a whirlpool carries straws, could be\r\nreadily understood; and though it appears to have been held by\r\nKepler that this current and vortex was immaterial, he ascribes to\r\nit the power of overcoming the inertia of bodies, and of putting\r\nthem and keeping them in motion, the only material properties with\r\nwhich he had any thing to do. Kepler's physical reasonings,\r\ntherefore, amount, in fact, to the doctrine of Vortices round the\r\ncentral bodies, and are occasionally so stated by himself; though by\r\nasserting these vortices to be \"an immaterial species,\" and by the\r\nfickleness and variety of his phraseology on the subject, he leaves\r\nthis theory in some confusion;--a proceeding, indeed, which both his\r\nwant of sound mechanical conceptions, and his busy and inventive\r\nfancy, might have led us to expect. Nor, we may venture to say, was\r\nit easy for any one at Kepler's time to devise a more plausible\r\ntheory than the theory of vortices might have been made. It was only\r\nwith the formation and progress of the science of Mechanics that\r\nthis theory became untenable.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\7: _De Stellâ Martis_, P. 3. c. xxxiv.]\r\n\r\n(_Descartes_) But if Kepler might be excused, or indeed admired, for\r\npropounding the theory of Vortices at his time, the case was\r\ndifferent when the laws of motion had been fully developed, and when\r\nthose who knew the state of mechanical science ought to have learned\r\nto consider the motions of the stars as a mechanical problem,\r\nsubject to the same conditions as other mechanical problems, and\r\ncapable of the same exactness of solution. And there was an especial\r\ninconsistency in the circumstance of the Theory of Vortices being\r\nput forwards by Descartes, who pretended, or was asserted by his\r\nadmirers, to have been one of the discoverers of the true Laws of\r\nMotion. It certainly shows both great conceit and great shallowness,\r\nthat he should have proclaimed with much pomp this crude invention\r\nof the ante-mechanical period, at the time when the best\r\nmathematicians of Europe, as Borelli in Italy, Hooke and Wallis in\r\nEngland, Huyghens in Holland, {388} were patiently laboring to bring\r\nthe mechanical problem of the universe into its most distinct form,\r\nin order that it might be solved at last and forever.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to assert that Descartes borrowed his doctrines from\r\nKepler, or from any of his predecessors, for the theory was\r\nsufficiently obvious; and especially if we suppose the inventor to\r\nseek his suggestions rather in the casual examples offered to the\r\nsense than in the exact laws of motion. Nor would it be reasonable\r\nto rob this philosopher of that credit, of the plausible deduction\r\nof a vast system from apparently simple principles, which, at the\r\ntime, was so much admired; and which undoubtedly was the great cause\r\nof the many converts to his views. At the same time we may venture\r\nto say that a system of doctrine thus deduced from assumed\r\nprinciples by a long chain of reasoning, and not verified and\r\nconfirmed at every step by detailed and exact facts, has hardly a\r\nchance of containing any truth. Descartes said that he should think\r\nit little to show how the world _is_ constructed, if he could not\r\nalso show that it _must_ of necessity have been so constructed. The\r\nmore modest philosophy which has survived the boastings of his\r\nschool is content to receive all its knowledge of facts from\r\nexperience, and never dreams of interposing its peremptory _must be_\r\nwhen nature is ready to tell us what _is_. The _à priori_\r\nphilosopher has, however, always a strong feeling in his favor among\r\nmen. The deductive form of his speculations gives them something of\r\nthe charm and the apparent certainty of pure mathematics; and while\r\nhe avoids that laborious recurrence to experiments, and measures,\r\nand multiplied observations, which is irksome and distasteful to\r\nthose who are impatient to grow wise at once, every fact of which\r\nthe theory appears to give an explanation, seems to be an unasked\r\nand almost an infallible witness in its favor.\r\n\r\nMy business with Descartes here is only with his physical Theory of\r\nVortices; which, great as was its glory at one time, is now utterly\r\nextinguished. It was propounded in his _Principia Philosophiæ_, in\r\n1644. In order to arrive at this theory, he begins, as might be\r\nexpected of him, from reasonings sufficiently general. He lays it\r\ndown as a maxim, in the first sentence of his book, that a person\r\nwho seeks for truth must, once in his life, doubt of all that he\r\nmost believes. Conceiving himself thus to have stripped himself of\r\nall his belief on all subjects, in order to resume that part of it\r\nwhich merits to be retained, he begins with his celebrated\r\nassertion, \"I think, therefore I am;\" which appears to him a certain\r\nand immovable principle, by means of {389} which he may proceed to\r\nsomething more. Accordingly, to this he soon adds the idea, and\r\nhence the certain existence, of God and his perfections. He then\r\nasserts it to be also manifest, that a vacuum in any part of the\r\nuniverse is impossible; the whole must be filled with matter, and\r\nthe matter must be divided into equal angular parts, this being the\r\nmost simple, and therefore the most natural supposition.[3\\7] This\r\nmatter being in motion, the parts are necessarily ground into a\r\nspherical form; and the corners thus rubbed off (like filings or\r\nsawdust) form a second and more subtle matter.[4\\7] There is,\r\nbesides, a third kind of matter, of parts more coarse and less\r\nfitted for motion. The first matter makes luminous bodies, as the\r\nsun, and the fixed stars; the second is the transparent substance of\r\nthe skies; the third is the material of opake bodies, as the earth,\r\nplanets, and comets. We may suppose, also,[5\\7] that the motions of\r\nthese parts take the form of revolving circular currents,[6\\7] or\r\n_vortices_. By this means, the first matter will be collected to the\r\ncentre of each vortex, while the second, or subtle matter, surrounds\r\nit, and, by its centrifugal effort, constitutes light. The planets\r\nare carried round the sun by the motion of his vortex,[7\\7] each\r\nplanet being at such a distance from the sun as to be in a part of\r\nthe vortex suitable to its solidity and mobility. The motions are\r\nprevented from being exactly circular and regular by various causes;\r\nfor instance, a vortex may be pressed into an oval shape by\r\ncontiguous vortices. The satellites are, in like manner, carried\r\nround their primary planets by subordinate vortices; while the\r\ncomets have sometimes the liberty of gliding out of one vortex into\r\nthe one next contiguous, and thus travelling in a sinuous course,\r\nfrom system to system, through the universe. It is not necessary for\r\nus to speak here of the entire deficiency of this system in\r\nmechanical consistency, and in a correspondency to observation in\r\ndetails and measures. Its general reception and temporary sway, in\r\nsome instances even among intelligent men and good mathematicians,\r\nare the most remarkable facts connected with it. These may be\r\nascribed, in part, to the circumstance that philosophers were now\r\nready and eager for a physical astronomy commensurate with the\r\nexisting state of knowledge; they may have been owing also, in some\r\nmeasure, to the character and position of Descartes. He was a man of\r\nhigh claims in every department of speculation, and, in pure\r\nmathematics, a genuine inventor of great eminence;--a man of family\r\nand a soldier;--an inoffensive philosopher, attacked and persecuted\r\n{390} for his opinions with great bigotry and fury by a Dutch\r\ndivine, Voet;--the favorite and teacher of two distinguished\r\nprincesses, and, it is said, the lover of one of them. This was\r\nElizabeth, the daughter of the Elector Frederick, and consequently\r\ngrand-daughter of our James the First. His other royal disciple, the\r\ncelebrated Christiana of Sweden, showed her zeal for his\r\ninstructions by appointing the hour of five in the morning for their\r\ninterviews. This, in the climate of Sweden, and in the winter, was\r\ntoo severe a trial for the constitution of the philosopher, born in\r\nthe sunny valley of the Loire; and, after a short residence at\r\nStockholm, he died of an inflammation of the chest in 1650. He\r\nalways kept up an active correspondence with his friend Mersenne,\r\nwho was called, by some of the Parisians, \"the Resident of Descartes\r\nat Paris;\" and who informed him of all that was done in the world of\r\nscience. It is said that he at first sent to Mersenne an account of\r\na system of the universe which he had devised, which went on the\r\nassumption of a vacuum; Mersenne informed him that the _vacuum_ was\r\nno longer the fashion at Paris; upon which he proceeded to remodel\r\nhis system, and to re-establish it on the principle of a _plenum_.\r\nUndoubtedly he tried to avoid promulgating opinions which might\r\nbring him into trouble. He, on all occasions, endeavored to explain\r\naway the doctrine of the motion of the earth, so as to evade the\r\nscruples to which the decrees of the pope had given rise; and, in\r\nstating the theory of vortices, he says,[8\\7] \"There is no doubt\r\nthat the world was created at first with all its perfection;\r\nnevertheless, it is well to consider how it might have arisen from\r\ncertain principles, although we know that it did not.\" Indeed, in\r\nthe whole of his philosophy, he appears to deserve the character of\r\nbeing both rash and cowardly, \"_pusillanimus simul et audax_,\" far\r\nmore than Aristotle, to whose physical speculations Bacon applies\r\nthis description.[9\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\7: _Prin._ p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\7: Ib. p. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\7: Ib. p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\7: Ib. p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\7: Ib. c. 140, p. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\7: _Prin._ p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\7: Bacon, _Descriptio Globi Intellectualis_.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the causes might be, his system was well received and\r\nrapidly adopted. Gassendi, indeed, says that he found nobody who had\r\nthe courage to read the _Principia_ through;[10\\7] but the system\r\nwas soon embraced by the younger professors, who were eager to\r\ndispute in its favor. It is said[11\\7] that the University of Paris\r\nwas on the point of publishing an edict against these new doctrines,\r\nand was only prevented from doing so by a pasquinade which is worth\r\nmentioning. It was composed by the poet Boileau (about 1684), and\r\nprofessed to be a Request in favor of Aristotle, and an Edict issued\r\nfrom Mount {391} Parnassus in consequence. It is obvious that, at\r\nthis time, the cause of Cartesianism was looked upon as the cause of\r\nfree inquiry and modern discovery, in opposition to that of bigotry,\r\nprejudice, and ignorance. Probably the poet was far from being a\r\nvery severe or profound critic of the truth of such claims. \"This\r\npetition of the Masters of Arts, Professors and Regents of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, humbly showeth, that it is of public notoriety\r\nthat the sublime and incomparable Aristotle was, without contest,\r\nthe first founder of the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water;\r\nthat he did, by special grace, accord unto them a simplicity which\r\nbelongeth not to them of natural right;\" and so on. \"Nevertheless,\r\nsince, a certain time past, two individuals, named Reason and\r\nExperience, have leagued themselves together to dispute his claim to\r\nthe rank which of justice pertains to him, and have tried to erect\r\nthemselves a throne on the ruins of his authority; and, in order the\r\nbetter to gain their ends, have excited certain factious spirits,\r\nwho, under the names of Cartesians and Gassendists, have begun to\r\nshake off the yoke of their master, Aristotle; and, contemning his\r\nauthority, with unexampled temerity, would dispute the right which\r\nhe had acquired of making true pass for false and false for\r\ntrue;\"--In fact, this production does not exhibit any of the\r\npeculiar tenets of Descartes, although, probably, the positive\r\npoints of his doctrines obtained a footing in the University of\r\nParis, under the cover of this assault on his adversaries. The\r\nPhysics of Rohault, a zealous disciple of Descartes, was published\r\nat Paris about 1670,[12\\7] and was, for a time, the standard book\r\nfor students of this subject, both in France and in England. I do\r\nnot here speak of the later defenders of the Cartesian system, for,\r\nin their hands, it was much modified by the struggle which it had to\r\nmaintain against the Newtonian system.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\7: Del. _A. M._ ii. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\7: _Enc. Brit._ art. _Cartesianism._]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\7: And a second edition in 1672.]\r\n\r\nWe are concerned with Descartes and his school only as they form\r\npart of the picture of the intellectual condition of Europe just\r\nbefore the publication of Newton's discoveries. Beyond this, the\r\nCartesian speculations are without value. When, indeed, Descartes'\r\ncountrymen could no longer refuse their assent and admiration to the\r\nNewtonian theory, it came to be the fashion among them to say that\r\nDescartes had been the necessary precursor of Newton; and to adopt a\r\nfavorite saying of Leibnitz, that the Cartesian philosophy was the\r\nantechamber of Truth. Yet this comparison is far from being happy:\r\nit appeared rather as if these suitors had mistaken the door; for\r\nthose {392} who first came into the presence of Truth herself, were\r\nthose who never entered this imagined antechamber, and those who\r\nwere in the antechamber first, were the last in penetrating further.\r\nIn partly the same spirit, Playfair has noted it as a service which\r\nNewton perhaps owed to Descartes, that \"he had exhausted one of the\r\nmost tempting forms of error.\" We shall see soon that this\r\ntemptation had no attraction for those who looked at the problem in\r\nits true light, as the Italian and English philosophers already did.\r\nVoltaire has observed, far more truly, that Newton's edifice rested\r\non no stone of Descartes' foundations. He illustrates this by\r\nrelating that Newton only once read the work of Descartes, and, in\r\ndoing so, wrote the word \"_error_,\" repeatedly, on the first seven\r\nor eight pages; after which he read no more. This volume, Voltaire\r\nadds, was for some time in the possession of Newton's nephew.[13\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\7: _Cartesianism_, Enc. Phil.]\r\n\r\n(_Gassendi._) Even in his own country, the system of Descartes was\r\nby no means universally adopted. We have seen that though Gassendi\r\nwas coupled with Descartes as one of the leaders of the new\r\nphilosophy, he was far from admiring his work. Gassendi's own views\r\nof the causes of the motions of the heavenly bodies are not very\r\nclear, nor even very clearly referrible to the laws of mechanics;\r\nalthough he was one of those who had most share in showing that\r\nthose laws apply to astronomical motions. In a chapter, headed[14\\7]\r\n\"Quæ sit motrix siderum causa,\" he reviews several opinions; but the\r\none which he seems to adopt, is that which ascribes the motion of\r\nthe celestial globes to certain fibres, of which the action is\r\nsimilar to that of the muscles of animals. It does not appear,\r\ntherefore, that he had distinctly apprehended, either the\r\ncontinuation of the movements of the planets by the First Law of\r\nMotion, or their deflection by the Second Law;--the two main steps\r\non the road to the discovery of the true forces by which they are\r\nmade to describe their orbits.\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\7: Gassendi, _Opera_, vol. i. p. 639.]\r\n\r\n(_Leibnitz, &c._) Nor does it appear that in Germany mathematicians\r\nhad attained this point of view. Leibnitz, as we have seen, did not\r\nassent to the opinions of Descartes, as containing the complete truth;\r\nand yet his own views of the physics of the universe do not seem to\r\nhave any great advantage over these. In 1671 he published _A new\r\nphysical hypothesis, by which the causes of most phenomena are deduced\r\nfrom a certain single universal motion supposed in our globe;--not to\r\nbe despised either by the Tychonians or the Copernicans_. He supposes\r\n{393} the particles of the earth to have separate motions, which\r\nproduce collisions, and thus propagate[15\\7] an \"agitation of the\r\nether,\" radiating in all directions; and,[16\\7] \"by the rotation of\r\nthe sun on its axis, concurring with its rectilinear action on the\r\nearth, arises the motion of the earth about the sun.\" The other\r\nmotions of the solar system are, as we might expect, accounted for in\r\na similar manner; but it appears difficult to invest such an\r\nhypothesis with any mechanical consistency.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\7: Art. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\7: Ib. 8.]\r\n\r\nJohn Bernoulli maintained to the last the Cartesian hypothesis,\r\nthough with several modifications of his own, and even pretended to\r\napply mathematical calculation to his principles. This, however,\r\nbelongs to a later period of our history; to the reception, not to\r\nthe prelude, of the Newtonian theory.\r\n\r\n(_Borelli._) In Italy, Holland, and England, mathematicians appear\r\nto have looked much more steadily at the problem of the celestial\r\nmotions, by the light which the discovery of the real laws of motion\r\nthrew upon it. In Borelli's _Theories of the Medicean Planets_,\r\nprinted at Florence in 1666, we have already a conception of the\r\nnature of central action, in which true notions begin to appear. The\r\nattraction of a body upon another which revolves about it is spoken\r\nof and likened to magnetic action; not converting the attracting\r\nforce into a transverse force, according to the erroneous views of\r\nKepler, but taking it as a tendency of the bodies to meet. \"It is\r\nmanifest,\" says he,[17\\7] \"that every planet and satellite revolves\r\nround some principal globe of the universe as a fountain of virtue,\r\nwhich so draws and holds them that they cannot by any means be\r\nseparated from it, but are compelled to follow it wherever it goes,\r\nin constant and continuous revolutions.\" And, further on, he\r\ndescribes[18\\7] the nature of the action, as a matter of conjecture\r\nindeed, but with remarkable correctness.[19\\7] \"We shall account for\r\nthese motions by supposing, that which can hardly be denied, that\r\nthe planets have a certain natural appetite for uniting themselves\r\nwith the globe round which they revolve, and that they really tend,\r\nwith all their efforts, to approach to such globe; the planets, for\r\ninstance, to the sun, the Medicean Stars to Jupiter. It is certain,\r\nalso, that circular motion gives a body a tendency to recede from\r\nthe centre of such revolution, as we find in a wheel, or a stone\r\nwhirled in a sling. Let us suppose, then, the planet to endeavor to\r\napproach the sun; since, in the mean time, it requires, by the\r\ncircular motion, a force to recede from the same central body, it\r\ncomes to pass, that when {394} those two opposite forces are equal,\r\neach compensates the other, and the planet cannot go nearer to the\r\nsun nor further from him than a certain determinate space, and thus\r\nappears balanced and floating about him.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\7: Cap. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\7: Ib. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\7: P. 47.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very remarkable passage; but it will be observed, at the\r\nsame time, that the author has no distinct conception of the manner\r\nin which the change of direction of the planet's motion is regulated\r\nfrom one instant to another; still less do his views lead to any\r\nmode of calculating the distance from the central body at which the\r\nplanet would be thus balanced, or the space through which it might\r\napproach to the centre and recede from it. There is a great interval\r\nfrom Borelli's guesses, even to Huyghens' theorems  and a much\r\ngreater to the beginning of Newton's discoveries.\r\n\r\n(_England._) It is peculiarly interesting to us to trace the gradual\r\napproach towards these discoveries which took place in the minds of\r\nEnglish mathematicians  and this we can do with tolerable\r\ndistinctness. Gilbert, in his work, _De Magnete_, printed in 1600,\r\nhas only some vague notions that the magnetic virtue of the earth in\r\nsome way determines the direction of the earth's axis, the rate of\r\nits diurnal rotation, and that of the revolution of the moon about\r\nit.[20\\7] He died in 1603, and, in his posthumous work, already\r\nmentioned (_De Mundo nostro Sublunari Philosophia nova_, 1651), we\r\nhave already a more distinct statement of the attraction of one body\r\nby another.[21\\7] \"The force which emanates from the moon reaches to\r\nthe earth, and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of the earth\r\npervades the region of the moon: both correspond and conspire by the\r\njoint action of both, according to a proportion and conformity of\r\nmotions; but the earth has more effect, in consequence of its\r\nsuperior mass; the earth attracts and repels the moon, and the moon,\r\nwithin certain limits, the earth; not so as to make the bodies come\r\ntogether, as magnetic bodies do, but so that they may go on in a\r\ncontinuous course.\" Though this phraseology is capable of\r\nrepresenting a good deal of the truth, it does not appear to have\r\nbeen connected, in the author's mind, with any very definite notions\r\nof mechanical action in detail. We may probably say the same of\r\nMilton's language:\r\n                       What if the sun\r\n  Be centre to the world; and other stars,\r\n  By his attractive virtue and their own\r\n  Incited, dance about him various rounds?\r\n          _Par. Lost_, B. viii. {395}\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\7: Lib. vi. cap. 6, 7.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\7: Ib. ii. c. 19.]\r\n\r\nBoyle, about the same period, seems to have inclined to the\r\nCartesian hypothesis. Thus, in order to show the advantage of the\r\nnatural theology which contemplates organic contrivances, over that\r\nwhich refers to astronomy, he remarks: \"It may be said, that in\r\nbodies inanimate,[22\\7] the contrivance is very rarely so exquisite\r\nbut that the various motions and occurrences of their parts may,\r\nwithout much improbability, be suspected capable, after many essays,\r\nto cast one another into several of those circumvolutions called by\r\nEpicurus συστροφὰς and by Descartes, _vortices_; which being once\r\nmade, may continue a long time after the manner explained by the\r\nlatter.\" Neither Milton nor Boyle, however, can be supposed to have\r\nhad an exact knowledge of the laws of mechanics; and therefore they\r\ndo not fully represent the views of their mathematical\r\ncontemporaries. But there arose about this time a group of\r\nphilosophers, who began to knock at the door where Truth was to be\r\nfound, although it was left for Newton to force it open. These were\r\nthe founders of the Royal Society, Wilkins, Wallis, Seth Ward, Wren,\r\nHooke, and others. The time of the beginning of the speculations and\r\nassociation of these men corresponds to the time of the civil wars\r\nbetween the king and parliament in England  and it does not appear a\r\nfanciful account of their scientific zeal and activity, to say, that\r\nwhile they shared the common mental ferment of the times, they\r\nsought in the calm and peaceful pursuit of knowledge a contrast to\r\nthe vexatious and angry struggles which at that time disturbed the\r\nrepose of society. It was well if these dissensions produced any\r\ngood to science to balance the obvious evils which flowed from them.\r\nGascoigne, the inventor of the micrometer, a friend of Horrox, was\r\nkilled in the battle of Marston Moor. Milburne, another friend of\r\nHorrox, who like him detected the errors of Lansberg's astronomical\r\ntables, left papers on this subject, which were lost by the coming\r\nof the Scotch army into England in 1639; in the civil war which\r\nensued, the anatomical collections of Harvey were plundered and\r\ndestroyed. Most of these persons of whom I have lately had to speak,\r\nwere involved in the changes of fortune of the Commonwealth, some on\r\none side, and some on the other. Wilkins was made Warden of Wadham\r\nby the committee of parliament appointed for reforming the\r\nUniversity of Oxford; and was, in 1659, made Master of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, by Richard Cromwell, but ejected thence the year\r\nfollowing, upon the restoration of the {396} royal sway. Seth Ward,\r\nwho was a Fellow of Sidney College, Cambridge, was deprived of his\r\nFellowship by the parliamentary committee; but at a later period\r\n(1649) he took the engagement to be faithful to the Commonwealth,\r\nand became Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. Wallis held a\r\nFellowship of Queen's College, Cambridge, but vacated it by\r\nmarriage. He was afterwards much employed by the royal party in\r\ndeciphering secret writings, in which art he had peculiar skill. Yet\r\nhe was appointed by the parliamentary commissioners Savilian\r\nProfessor of Geometry at Oxford, in which situation he was continued\r\nby Charles II. after his restoration. Christopher Wren was somewhat\r\nlater, and escaped these changes. He was chosen Fellow of All-Souls\r\nin 1652, and succeeded Ward as Savilian Professor of Astronomy.\r\nThese men, along with Boyle and several others, formed themselves\r\ninto a club, which they called the Philosophical, or the Invisible\r\nCollege; and met, from about the year 1645, sometimes in London, and\r\nsometimes in Oxford, according to the changes of fortune and\r\nresidence of the members. Hooke went to Christ Church, Oxford, in\r\n1663, where he was patronized by Boyle, Ward, and Wallis; and when\r\nthe Philosophical College resumed its meetings in London, after the\r\nRestoration, as the Royal Society, Hooke was made \"curator of\r\nexperiments.\" Halley was of the next generation, and comes after\r\nNewton; he studied at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1673; but was at\r\nfirst a man of some fortune, and not engaged in any official\r\nsituation. His talents and zeal, however, made him an active and\r\neffective ally in the promotion of science.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\7: Shaw's Boyle's _Works_, ii. 160.]\r\n\r\nThe connection of the persons of whom we have been speaking has a\r\nbearing on our subject, for it led, historically speaking, to the\r\npublication of Newton's discoveries in physical astronomy. Rightly\r\nto propose a problem is no inconsiderable step to its solution; and\r\nit was undoubtedly a great advance towards the true theory of the\r\nuniverse to consider the motion of the planets round the sun as a\r\nmechanical question, to be solved by a reference to the laws of\r\nmotion, and by the use of mathematics. So far the English\r\nphilosophers appear to have gone, before the time of Newton. Hooke,\r\nindeed, when the doctrine of gravitation was published, asserted\r\nthat he had discovered it previously to Newton; and though this\r\npretension could not be maintained, he certainly had perceived that\r\nthe thing to be done was, to determine the effect of a central force\r\nin producing curvilinear motion; which effect, as we have already\r\nseen, he illustrated by experiment as early as 1666. Hooke had also\r\nspoken more clearly on this subject {397} in _An Attempt to prove\r\nthe Motion of the Earth from Observations_, published in 1674. In\r\nthis, he distinctly states that the planets would move in straight\r\nlines, if they were not deflected by central forces; and that the\r\ncentral attractive power increases in approaching the centre in\r\ncertain degrees, dependent on the distance. \"Now what these degrees\r\nare,\" he adds, \"I have not yet experimentally verified;\" but he\r\nventures to promise to any one who succeeds in this undertaking, a\r\ndiscovery of the cause of the heavenly motions. He asserted, in\r\nconversation, to Halley and Wren, that he had solved this problem,\r\nbut his solution was never produced. The proposition that the\r\nattractive force of the sun varies inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance from the centre, had already been divined, if not fully\r\nestablished. If the orbits of the planets were circles, this\r\nproportion of the forces might be deduced in the same manner as the\r\npropositions concerning circular motion, which Huyghens published in\r\n1673; yet it does not appear that Huyghens made this application of\r\nhis principles. Newton, however, had already made this step some\r\nyears before this time. Accordingly, he says in a letter to Halley,\r\non Hooke's claim to this discovery,[23\\7] \"When Huygenius put out\r\nhis _Horologium Oscillatorium_, a copy being presented to me, in my\r\nletter of thanks I gave those rules in the end thereof a particular\r\ncommendation for their usefulness in computing the forces of the\r\nmoon from the earth, and the earth from the sun.\" He says, moreover,\r\n\"I am almost confident by circumstances, that Sir Christopher Wren\r\nknew the duplicate proportion when I gave him a visit; and then Mr.\r\nHooke, by his book _Cometa_, will prove the last of us three that\r\nknew it.\" Hooke's _Cometa_ was published in 1678. These inferences\r\nwere all connected with Kepler's law, that the times are in the\r\nsesquiplicate ratio of the major axes of the orbits. But Halley had\r\nalso been led to the duplicate proportion by another train of\r\nreasoning, namely, by considering the force of the sun as an\r\nemanation, which must become more feeble in proportion to the\r\nincreased spherical surface over which it is diffused, and therefore\r\nin the inverse proportion of the square of the distances.[24\\7] In\r\nthis view of the matter, however, the difficulty was to determine\r\nwhat would be the motion of a body acted on by such a force, when\r\nthe orbit is not circular but oblong. The investigation of this case\r\nwas a problem which, we can {398} easily conceive, must have\r\nappeared of very formidable complexity while it was unsolved, and\r\nthe first of its kind. Accordingly Halley, as his biographer says,\r\n\"finding himself unable to make it out in any geometrical way, first\r\napplied to Mr. Hooke and Sir Christopher Wren, and meeting with no\r\nassistance from either of them, he went to Cambridge in August\r\n(1684), to Mr. Newton, who supplied him fully with what he had so\r\nardently sought.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\7: _Biog. Brit._, art. _Hooke._]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\7: Bullialdus, in 1645, had asserted that the force by\r\nwhich the sun \"prehendit et harpagat,\" takes hold of and grapples\r\nthe planets, must be as the inverse square of the distance.]\r\n\r\nA paper of Halley's in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for January,\r\n1686, professedly inserted as a preparation for Newton's work,\r\ncontains some arguments against the Cartesian hypothesis of gravity,\r\nwhich seem to imply that Cartesian opinions had some footing among\r\nEnglish philosophers; and we are told by Whiston, Newton's successor\r\nin his professorship at Cambridge, that Cartesianism formed a part\r\nof the studies of that place. Indeed, Rohault's _Physics_ was used\r\nas a classbook at that University long after the time of which we\r\nare speaking; but the peculiar Cartesian doctrines which it\r\ncontained were soon superseded by others.\r\n\r\nWith regard, then, to this part of the discovery, that the force of\r\nthe sun follows the inverse duplicate proportion of the distances,\r\nwe see that several other persons were on the verge of it at the\r\nsame time with Newton; though he alone possessed that combination of\r\ndistinctness of thought and power of mathematical invention, which\r\nenabled him to force his way across the barrier. But another, and so\r\nfar as we know, an earlier train of thought, led by a different path\r\nto the same result; and it was the convergence of these two lines of\r\nreasoning that brought the conclusion to men's minds with\r\nirresistible force. I speak now of the identification of the force\r\nwhich retains the moon in her orbit with the force of gravity by\r\nwhich bodies fall at the earth's surface. In this comparison Newton\r\nhad, so far as I am aware, no forerunner. We are now, therefore,\r\narrived at the point at which the history of Newton's great\r\ndiscovery properly begins. {399}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE INDUCTIVE EPOCH OF NEWTON.--DISCOVERY OF THE UNIVERSAL\r\nGRAVITATION OF MATTER, ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE INVERSE SQUARE OF\r\nTHE DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN order that we may the more clearly consider the bearing of this,\r\nthe greatest scientific discovery ever made, we shall resolve it\r\ninto the partial propositions of which it consists. Of these we may\r\nenumerate five. The doctrine of universal gravitation asserts,\r\n\r\n1. That the force by which the _different_ planets are attracted to\r\nthe sun is in the inverse proportion of the squares of their\r\ndistances;\r\n\r\n2. That the force by which the _same_ planet is attracted to the\r\nsun, in different parts of its orbit, is also in the inverse\r\nproportion of the squares of the distances;\r\n\r\n3. That the _earth_ also exerts such a force on the _moon_, and that\r\nthis force is identical with the force of _gravity_;\r\n\r\n4. That bodies thus act on _other_ bodies, besides those which\r\nrevolve round them; thus, that the sun exerts such a force on the\r\nmoon and satellites, and that the planets exert such forces on _one\r\nanother_;\r\n\r\n5. That this force, thus exerted by the general masses of the sun,\r\nearth, and planets, arises from the attraction of _each particle_ of\r\nthese masses; which attraction follows the above law, and belongs to\r\nall matter alike.\r\n\r\nThe history of the establishment of these five truths will be given\r\nin order.\r\n\r\n1. _Sun's Force on Different Planets._--With regard to the first of\r\nthe above five propositions, that the different planets are\r\nattracted to the sun by a force which is inversely as the square of\r\nthe distance, Newton had so far been anticipated, that several\r\npersons had discovered it to be true, or nearly true; that is, they\r\nhad discovered that if the orbits of the planets were circles, the\r\nproportions of the central force to the inverse square of the\r\ndistance would follow from Kepler's third law, of the sesquiplicate\r\nproportion of the periodic times. As we have seen, Huyghens'\r\ntheorems would have proved this, if they had been so applied; Wren\r\nknew it; Hooke not only knew it, but claimed a prior knowledge to\r\nNewton; and Halley had satisfied himself that it was at {400} least\r\nnearly true, before he visited Newton. Hooke was reported to Newton\r\nat Cambridge, as having applied to the Royal Society to do him\r\njustice with regard to his claims; but when Halley wrote and\r\ninformed Newton (in a letter dated June 29, 1686), that Hooke's\r\nconduct \"had been represented in worse colors than it ought,\" Newton\r\ninserted in his book a notice of these his predecessors, in order,\r\nas he said, \"to compose the dispute.\"[25\\7] This notice appears in a\r\nScholium to the fourth Proposition of the _Principia_, which states\r\nthe general law of revolutions in circles. \"The case of the sixth\r\ncorollary,\" Newton there says, \"obtains in the celestial bodies, as\r\nhas been separately inferred by our countrymen, Wren, Hooke, and\r\nHalley;\" he soon after names Huyghens, \"who, in his excellent\r\ntreatise _De Horologio Oscillatorio_, compares the force of gravity\r\nwith the centrifugal forces of revolving bodies.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\7: _Biog. Brit._ folio, art. _Hooke._]\r\n\r\nThe two steps requisite for this discovery were, to propose the\r\nmotions of the planets as simply a mechanical problem, and to apply\r\nmathematical reasoning so as to solve this problem, with reference to\r\nKepler's third law considered as a fact. The former step was a\r\nconsequence of the mechanical discoveries of Galileo and his school;\r\nthe result of the firm and clear place which these gradually obtained\r\nin men's mind, and of the utter abolition of all the notions of solid\r\nspheres by Kepler. The mathematical step required no small\r\nmathematical powers; as appears, when we consider that this was the\r\nfirst example of such a problem, and that the method of limits, under\r\nall its forms, was at this time in its infancy, or rather, at its\r\nbirth. Accordingly, even this step, though much the easiest in the\r\npath of deduction, no one before Newton completely executed.\r\n\r\n2. _Force in different Points of an Orbit._--The inference of the\r\nlaw of the force from Kepler's two laws concerning the elliptical\r\nmotion, was a problem quite different from the preceding, and much\r\nmore difficult; but the dispute with respect to priority in the two\r\npropositions was intermingled. Borelli, in 1666, had, as we have\r\nseen, endeavored to reconcile the general form of the orbit with the\r\nnotion of a central attractive force, by taking centrifugal force\r\ninto the account; and Hooke, in 1679, had asserted that the result\r\nof the law of the inverse square in the force of the earth would be\r\nan ellipse,[26\\7] or a curve like an ellipse.[27\\7] But it does not\r\nappear that this was any thing more than {401} a conjecture. Halley\r\nsays[28\\7] that \"Hooke, in 1683, told him he had demonstrated all\r\nthe laws of the celestial motions by the reciprocally duplicate\r\nproportion of the force of gravity; but that, being offered forty\r\nshillings by Sir Christopher Wren to produce such a demonstration,\r\nhis answer was, that he had it, but would conceal it for some time,\r\nthat others, trying and failing, might know how to value it when he\r\nshould make it public.\" Halley, however, truly observes, that after\r\nthe publication of the demonstration in the _Principia_, this reason\r\nno longer held; and adds, \"I have plainly told him, that unless he\r\nproduce another differing demonstration, and let the world judge of\r\nit, neither I nor any one else can believe it.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\7: Newton's Letter, _Biog. Brit._, Hooke, p. 2660.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\7: Birch's _Hist. R. S._, Wallis's Life.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\7: _Enc. Brit._, Hooke, p. 2660.]\r\n\r\nNewton allows that Hooke's assertions in 1679 gave occasion to his\r\ninvestigation on this point of the theory. His demonstration is\r\ncontained in the second and third Sections of the _Principia_. He\r\nfirst treats of the general law of central forces in any curve; and\r\nthen, on account, as he states, of the application to the motion of\r\nthe heavenly bodies, he treats of the case of force varying\r\ninversely as the square of the distance, in a more diffuse manner.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in the former portion of his discovery, the two steps\r\nwere, the proposing the heavenly motions as a mechanical problem,\r\nand the solving this problem. Borelli and Hooke had certainly made\r\nthe former step, with considerable distinctness; but the\r\nmathematical solution required no common inventive power.\r\n\r\nNewton seems to have been much ruffled by Hooke's speaking slightly\r\nof the value of this second step; and is moved in return to deny\r\nHooke's pretensions with some asperity, and to assert his own. He\r\nsays, in a letter to Halley, \"Borelli did something in it, and wrote\r\nmodestly; he (Hooke) has done nothing; and yet written in such a way\r\nas if he knew, and had sufficiently hinted all but what remained to\r\nbe determined by the drudgery of calculations and observations;\r\nexcusing himself from that labor by reason of his other business;\r\nwhereas he should rather have excused himself by reason of his\r\ninability; for it is very plain, by his words, he knew not how to go\r\nabout it. Now is not this very fine? Mathematicians that find out,\r\nsettle, and do all the business, must content themselves with being\r\nnothing but dry calculators and drudges; and another that does\r\nnothing but pretend and grasp at all things, must carry away all the\r\ninventions, as well of those that were to follow him as of those\r\nthat {402} went before.\" This was written, however, under the\r\ninfluence of some degree of mistake; and in a subsequent letter,\r\nNewton says, \"Now I understand he was in some respects\r\nmisrepresented to me, I wish I had spared the postscript to my\r\nlast,\" in which is the passage just quoted. We see, by the melting\r\naway of rival claims, the undivided honor which belongs to Newton,\r\nas the real discoverer of the proposition now under notice. We may\r\nadd, that in the sequel of the third Section of the _Principia_, he\r\nhas traced its consequences, and solved various problems flowing\r\nfrom it with his usual fertility and beauty of mathematical\r\nresource; and has there shown the necessary connection of Kepler's\r\nthird law with his first and second.\r\n\r\n3. _Moon's Gravity to the Earth._--Though others had considered\r\ncosmical forces as governed by the general laws of motion, it does not\r\nappear that they had identified such forces with the force of\r\nterrestrial gravity. This step in Newton's discoveries has generally\r\nbeen the most spoken of by superficial thinkers; and a false kind of\r\ninterest has been attached to it, from the story of its being\r\nsuggested by the fall of an apple. The popular mind is caught by the\r\ncharacter of an eventful narrative which the anecdote gives to this\r\noccurrence; and by the antithesis which makes a profound theory appear\r\nthe result of a trivial accident. How inappropriate is such a view of\r\nthe matter we shall soon see. The narrative of the progress of\r\nNewton's thoughts, is given by Pemberton (who had it from Newton\r\nhimself) in his preface to his _View of Newton's Philosophy_, and by\r\nVoltaire, who had it from Mrs. Conduit, Newton's niece.[29\\7] \"The\r\nfirst thoughts,\" we are told, \"which gave rise to his _Principia_, he\r\nhad when he retired from Cambridge, in 1666, on account of the plague\r\n(he was then twenty-four years of age). As he sat alone in a garden,\r\nhe fell into a speculation on the power of gravity; that as this power\r\nis not found sensibly diminished at the remotest distance from the\r\ncentre of the earth to which we can rise, neither at the tops of the\r\nloftiest buildings, nor even on the summits of the highest mountains,\r\nit appeared to him reasonable to conclude that this power must extend\r\nmuch further than was usually thought: Why not as high as the moon?\r\nsaid he to himself; and if so, her motion must be influenced by it;\r\nperhaps she is retained in her orbit thereby.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\7: _Elémens de Phil. de Newton_, 3me partie, chap. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe thought of cosmical gravitation was thus distinctly brought into\r\nbeing; and Newton's superiority here was, that he conceived the\r\n{403} celestial motions as distinctly as the motions which took\r\nplace close to him;--considered them as of the same kind, and\r\napplied the same rules to each, without hesitation or obscurity. But\r\nso far, this thought was merely a guess: its occurrence showed the\r\nactivity of the thinker; but to give it any value, it required much\r\nmore than a \"why not?\"--a \"perhaps.\" Accordingly, Newton's \"why not?\"\r\nwas immediately succeeded by his \"if so, what then?\" His reasoning\r\nwas, that if gravity reach to the moon, it is probably of the same\r\nkind as the central force of the sun, and follows the same rule with\r\nrespect to the distance. What is this rule? We have already seen\r\nthat, by calculating from Kepler's laws, and supposing the orbits to\r\nbe circles, the rule of the force appears to be the inverse\r\nduplicate proportion of the distance; and this, which had been\r\ncurrent as a conjecture among the previous generation of\r\nmathematicians, Newton had already proved by indisputable\r\nreasonings, and was thus prepared to proceed in his train of\r\ninquiry. If, then, he went on, pursuing his train of thought, the\r\nearth's gravity extend to the moon, diminishing according to the\r\ninverse square of the distance, will it, at the moon's orbit, be of\r\nthe proper magnitude for retaining her in her path? Here again came\r\nin calculation, and a calculation of extreme interest; for how\r\nimportant and how critical was the decision which depended on the\r\nresulting numbers? According to Newton's calculations, made at this\r\ntime, the moon by her motion in her orbit, was deflected from the\r\ntangent every minute through a space of thirteen feet. But by\r\nnoticing the space through which bodies would fall in one minute at\r\nthe earth's surface, and supposing this to be diminished in the\r\nratio of the inverse square, it appeared that gravity would, at the\r\nmoon's orbit, draw a body through more than fifteen feet. The\r\ndifference seems small, the approximation encouraging, the theory\r\nplausible; a man in love with his own fancies would readily have\r\ndiscovered or invented some probable cause of this difference. But\r\nNewton acquiesced in it as a disproof of his conjecture, and \"laid\r\naside at that time any further thoughts of this matter;**\" thus\r\nresigning a favorite hypothesis, with a candor and openness to\r\nconviction not inferior to Kepler, though his notion had been taken\r\nup on far stronger and sounder grounds than Kepler dealt in; and\r\nwithout even, so far as we know, Kepler's regrets and struggles. Nor\r\nwas this levity or indifference; the idea, though thus laid aside,\r\nwas not finally condemned and abandoned. When Hooke, in 1679,\r\ncontradicted Newton on the subject of the curve described by a\r\nfalling body, and asserted it to be an ellipse, Newton {404} was led\r\nto investigate the subject, and was then again conducted, by another\r\nroad, to the same law of the inverse square of the distance. This\r\nnaturally turned his thoughts to his former speculations. Was there\r\nreally no way of explaining the discrepancy which this law gave,\r\nwhen he attempted to reduce the moon's motion to the action of\r\ngravity? A scientific operation then recently completed, gave the\r\nexplanation at once. He had been mistaken in the magnitude of the\r\nearth, and consequently in the distance of the moon, which is\r\ndetermined by measurements of which the earth's radius is the base.\r\nHe had taken the common estimate, current among geographers and\r\nseamen, that sixty English miles are contained in one degree of\r\nlatitude. But Picard, in 1670, had measured the length of a certain\r\nportion of the meridian in France, with far greater accuracy than\r\nhad yet been attained  and this measure enabled Newton to repeat his\r\ncalculations with these amended data. We may imagine the strong\r\ncuriosity which he must have felt as to the result of these\r\ncalculations. His former conjecture was now found to agree with the\r\nphenomena to a remarkable degree of precision. This conclusion, thus\r\ncoming after long doubts and delays, and falling in with the other\r\nresults of mechanical calculation for the solar system, gave a stamp\r\nfrom that moment to his opinions, and through him to those of the\r\nwhole philosophical world.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [Dr. Robison (_Mechanical Philosophy_, p. 288) says that\r\nNewton having become a member of the Royal Society, there learned\r\nthe accurate measurement of the earth by Picard, differing very much\r\nfrom the estimation by which he had made his calculations in 1666.\r\nAnd M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, published in the _Biographie\r\nUniverselle_, says, \"According to conjecture, about the month of\r\nJune, 1682, Newton being in London at a meeting of the Royal\r\nSociety, mention was made of the new measure of a degree of the\r\nearth's surface, recently executed in France by Picard; and great\r\npraise was given to the care which had been employed in making this\r\nmeasure exact.\"\r\n\r\nI had adopted this conjecture as a fact in my first edition; but it\r\nhas been pointed out by Prof. Rigaud (_Historical Essay on the First\r\nPublication of the Principia_, 1838), that Picard's measurement was\r\nprobably well known to the Fellows of the Royal Society as early as\r\n1675, there being an account of the results of it given in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ for that year. Newton appears to have\r\ndiscovered the method of determining that a body might describe an\r\nellipse when acted upon by a force residing in the focus, and\r\nvarying {405} inversely as the square of the distance, in 1679, upon\r\noccasion of his correspondence with Hooke. In 1684, at Halley's\r\nrequest, he returned to the subject, and in February, 1685, there\r\nwas inserted in the Register of the Royal Society a paper of\r\nNewton's (_Isaaci Newtoni Propositiones de Motu_) which contained\r\nsome of the principal Propositions of the first two Books of the\r\n_Principia_. This paper, however, does not contain the Proposition\r\n\"Lunam gravitare in terram,\" nor any of the other propositions of\r\nthe third Book. The _Principia_ was printed in 1686 and 7,\r\napparently at the expense of Halley. On the 6th of April, 1687, the\r\nthird Book was presented to the Royal Society.]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, I think, that before Newton, philosophers in\r\ngeneral had supposed that terrestrial gravity was the very force by\r\nwhich the moon's motions are produced. Men had, as we have seen,\r\ntaken up the conception of such forces, and had probably called them\r\ngravity: but this was done only to explain, by analogy, what _kind_\r\nof forces they were, just as at other times they compared them with\r\nmagnetism; and it did not imply that terrestrial gravity was a force\r\nwhich acted in the celestial spaces. After Newton had discovered\r\nthat this was so, the application of the term \"gravity\" did\r\nundoubtedly convey such a suggestion; but we should err if we\r\ninferred from this coincidence of expression that the notion was\r\ncommonly entertained before him. Thus Huyghens appears to use\r\nlanguage which may be mistaken, when he says,[30\\7] that Borelli was\r\nof opinion that the primary planets were urged by \"gravity\" towards\r\nthe sun, and the satellites towards the primaries. The notion of\r\nterrestrial gravity, as being actually a cosmical force, is foreign\r\nto all Borelli's speculations.[31\\7] But Horrox, as early as 1635,\r\nappears to have entertained the true view on this subject, although\r\nvitiated by Keplerian errors concerning the connection between the\r\nrotation of the central body and its effect on the body which\r\nrevolves about it. Thus he says,[32\\7] that the emanation of the\r\nearth carries a projected stone along with the motion of the earth,\r\njust in the same way as it carries the moon in her orbit; and that\r\nthis force is greater on the stone than on the moon, because the\r\ndistance is less.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\7: _**Cosmotheoros_, l. 2. p. 720.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\7: I have found no instance in which the word is so used by\r\nhim.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\7: _Astronomia Kepleriana defensa et promota_, cap. 2. See\r\nfurther on this subject in the _Additions_ to this volume.]\r\n\r\nThe Proposition in which Newton has stated the discovery of which we\r\nare now speaking, is the fourth of his third Book: \"That the moon\r\ngravitates to the earth, and by the force of gravity is perpetually\r\n{406} deflected from a rectilinear motion, and retained in her\r\norbit.\" The proof consists in the numerical calculation, of which he\r\nonly gives the elements, and points out the method; but we may\r\nobserve, that no small degree of knowledge of the way in which\r\nastronomers had obtained these elements, and judgment in selecting\r\namong them, were necessary: thus, the mean distance of the moon had\r\nbeen made as little as fifty-six and a half semidiameters of the\r\nearth by Tycho, and as much as sixty-two and a half by Kircher:\r\nNewton gives good reasons for adopting sixty-one.\r\n\r\nThe term \"gravity,\" and the expression \"to gravitate,\" which, as we\r\nhave just seen, Newton uses of the moon, were to receive a still\r\nwider application in consequence of his discoveries; but in order to\r\nmake this extension clearer, we consider it as a separate step.\r\n\r\n4. _Mutual Attraction of all the Celestial Bodies._--If the\r\npreceding parts of the discovery of gravitation were comparatively\r\neasy to conjecture, and difficult to prove, this was much more the\r\ncase with the part of which we have now to speak, the attraction of\r\nother bodies, besides the central ones, upon the planets and\r\nsatellites. If the mathematical calculation of the unmixed effect of\r\na central force required transcendent talents, how much must the\r\ndifficulty be increased, when other influences prevented those first\r\nresults from being accurately verified, while the deviations from\r\naccuracy were far more complex than the original action! If it had\r\nnot been that these deviations, though surprisingly numerous and\r\ncomplicated in their nature, were very small in their quantity, it\r\nwould have been impossible for the intellect of man to deal with the\r\nsubject; as it was, the struggle with its difficulties is even now a\r\nmatter of wonder.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture that there is some mutual action of the planets, had\r\nbeen put forth by Hooke in his _Attempt to prove the Motion of the\r\nEarth_ (1674). It followed, he said, from his doctrine, that not\r\nonly the sun and moon act upon the course and motion of the earth,\r\nbut that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have also, by\r\ntheir attractive power, a considerable influence upon the motion of\r\nthe earth, and the earth in like manner powerfully affects the\r\nmotions of those bodies. And Borelli, in attempting to form\r\n\"theories\" of the satellites of Jupiter, had seen, though dimly and\r\nconfusedly, the probability that the sun would disturb the motions\r\nof these bodies. Thus he says (cap. 14), \"How can we believe that\r\nthe Medicean globes are not, like other planets, impelled with a\r\ngreater velocity when they approach the sun: and thus they are acted\r\nupon by two moving forces, one of {407} which produces their proper\r\nrevolution about Jupiter, the other regulates their motion round the\r\nsun.\" And in another place (cap. 20), he attempts to show an effect\r\nof this principle upon the inclination of the orbit; though, as\r\nmight be expected, without any real result.\r\n\r\nThe case which most obviously suggests the notion that the sun\r\nexerts a power to disturb the motions of secondary planets about\r\nprimary ones, might seem to be our own moon; for the great\r\ninequalities which had hitherto been discovered, had all, except the\r\nfirst, or elliptical anomaly, a reference to the position of the\r\nsun. Nevertheless, I do not know that any one had attempted thus to\r\nexplain the curiously irregular course of the earth's attendant. To\r\ncalculate, from the disturbing agency, the amount of the\r\nirregularities, was a problem which could not, at any former period,\r\nhave been dreamt of as likely to be at any time within the verge of\r\nhuman power.\r\n\r\nNewton both made the step of inferring that there were such forces,\r\nand, to a very great extent, calculated the effects of them. The\r\ninference is made on mechanical principles, in the sixth Theorem of\r\nthe third Book of the _Principia_;--that the moon is attracted by\r\nthe sun, as the earth is;--that the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn\r\nare attracted as the primaries are; in the same manner, and with the\r\nsame forces. If this were not so, it is shown that these attendant\r\nbodies could not accompany the principal ones in the regular manner\r\nin which they do. All those bodies at equal distances from the sun\r\nwould be equally attracted.\r\n\r\nBut the complexity which must occur in tracing the results of this\r\nprinciple will easily be seen. The satellite and the primary, though\r\nnearly at the same distance, and in the same direction, from the\r\nsun, are not exactly so. Moreover the difference of the distances\r\nand of the directions is perpetually changing; and if the motion of\r\nthe satellite be elliptical, the cycle of change is long and\r\nintricate: on this account alone the effects of the sun's action\r\nwill inevitably follow cycles as long and as perplexed as those of\r\nthe positions. But on another account they will be still more\r\ncomplicated; for in the continued action of a force, the effect\r\nwhich takes place at first, modifies and alters the effect\r\nafterwards. The result at any moment is the sum of the results in\r\npreceding instants: and since the terms, in this series of\r\ninstantaneous effects, follow very complex rules, the sums of such\r\nseries will be, it might be expected, utterly incapable of being\r\nreduced to any manageable degree of simplicity.\r\n\r\nIt certainly does not appear that any one but Newton could make\r\n{408} any impression on this problem, or course of problems. No one\r\nfor sixty years after the publication of the _Principia_, and, with\r\nNewton's methods, no one up to the present day, had added any thing\r\nof any value to his deductions. We know that he calculated all the\r\nprincipal lunar inequalities; in many of the cases, he has given us\r\nhis processes; in others, only his results. But who has presented,\r\nin his beautiful geometry, or deduced from his simple principles,\r\nany of the inequalities which he left untouched? The ponderous\r\ninstrument of synthesis, so effective in his hands, has never since\r\nbeen grasped by one who could use it for such purposes; and we gaze\r\nat it with admiring curiosity, as on some gigantic implement of war,\r\nwhich stands idle among the memorials of ancient days, and makes us\r\nwonder what manner of man he was who could wield as a weapon what we\r\ncan hardly lift as a burden.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to point out in detail the sagacity and skill\r\nwhich mark this part of the _Principia_. The mode in which the\r\nauthor obtains the effect of a disturbing force in producing a\r\nmotion of the apse of an elliptical orbit (the ninth Section of the\r\nfirst Book), has always been admired for its ingenuity and elegance.\r\nThe general statement of the nature of the principal inequalities\r\nproduced by the sun in the motion of a satellite, given in the\r\nsixty-sixth Proposition, is, even yet, one of the best explanations\r\nof such action; and the calculations of the quantity of the effects\r\nin the third Book, for instance, the _variation_ of the moon, the\r\n_motion of the nodes_ and its inequalities, the _change of\r\ninclination_ of the orbit,--are full of beautiful and efficacious\r\nartifices. But Newton's inventive faculty was exercised to an extent\r\ngreater than these published investigations show. In several cases\r\nhe has suppressed the demonstration of his method, and given us the\r\nresult only; either from haste or from mere weariness, which might\r\nwell overtake one who, while he was struggling with facts and\r\nnumbers, with difficulties of conception and practice, was aiming\r\nalso at that geometrical elegance of exposition, which he considered\r\nas alone fit for the public eye. Thus, in stating the effect of the\r\neccentricity of the moon's orbit upon the motion of the apogee, he\r\nsays,[33\\7] \"The computations, as too intricate and embarrassed with\r\napproximations, I do not choose to introduce.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\7: Schol. to Prop. 35, first edit.]\r\n\r\nThe computations of the theoretical motion of the moon being thus\r\ndifficult, and its irregularities numerous and complex, we may ask\r\n{409} whether Newton's reasoning was sufficient to establish this\r\npart of his theory; namely, that her actual motions arise from her\r\ngravitation to the sun. And to this we may reply, that it was\r\nsufficient for that purpose,--since it showed that, from Newton's\r\nhypothesis, inequalities must result, following the laws which the\r\nmoon's inequalities were known to follow;--since the amount of the\r\ninequalities given by the theory agreed nearly with the rules which\r\nastronomers had collected from observation;--and since, by the very\r\nintricacy of the calculation, it was rendered probable, that the\r\nfirst results might be somewhat inaccurate, and thus might give rise\r\nto the still remaining differences between the calculations and the\r\nfacts. A _Progression of the Apogee_; a _Regression of the Nodes_;\r\nand, besides the Elliptical, or first Inequality, an inequality,\r\nfollowing the law of the _Evection_, or second inequality discovered\r\nby Ptolemy; another, following the law of the _Variation_ discovered\r\nby Tycho;--were pointed out in the first edition of the _Principia_,\r\nas the consequences of the theory. Moreover, the quantities of these\r\ninequalities were calculated and compared with observation with the\r\nutmost confidence, and the agreement in most instances was striking.\r\nThe Variation agreed with Halley's recent observations within a\r\nminute of a degree.[34\\7] The Mean Motion of the Nodes in a year\r\nagreed within less than one-hundredth of the whole.[35\\7] The\r\nEquation of the Motion of the Nodes also agreed well.[36\\7] The\r\nInclination of the Plane of the Orbit to the ecliptic, and its\r\nchanges, according to the different situations of the nodes,\r\nlikewise agreed.[37\\7] The Evection has been already noticed as\r\nencumbered with peculiar difficulties: here the accordance was less\r\nclose. The Difference of the daily progress of the Apogee in syzygy,\r\nand its daily Regress in Quadratures, is, Newton says, \"4¼ minutes\r\nby the Tables, 6⅔ by our calculation.\" He boldly adds, \"I suspect\r\nthis difference to be due to the fault of the Tables.\" In the second\r\nedition (1711) he added the calculation of several other\r\ninequalities, as the _Annual Equation_, also discovered by Tycho;\r\nand he compared them with more recent observations made by Flamsteed\r\nat Greenwich; but even in what has already been stated, it must be\r\nallowed that there is a wonderful accordance of theory with\r\nphenomena, both being very complex in the rules which they educe.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\7: B. iii. Prop. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\7: Prop. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\7: Prop. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\7: Prop. 35.]\r\n\r\nThe same theory which gave these Inequalities in the motion of the\r\nMoon produced by the disturbing force of the sun, gave also {410}\r\ncorresponding Inequalities in the motions of the Satellites of other\r\nplanets, arising from the same cause; and likewise pointed out the\r\nnecessary existence of irregularities in the motions of the Planets\r\narising from their mutual attraction. Newton gave propositions by\r\nwhich the Irregularities of the motion of Jupiter's moons might be\r\ndeduced from those of our own;[38\\7] and it was shown that the\r\nmotions of their nodes would be slow by theory, as Flamsteed had\r\nfound it to be by observation.[39\\7] But Newton did not attempt to\r\ncalculate the effect of the mutual action of the planets, though he\r\nobserves, that in the case of Jupiter and Saturn this effect is too\r\nconsiderable to be neglected;[40\\7] and he notices in the second\r\nedition,[41\\7] that it follows from the theory of gravity, that the\r\naphelia of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars, slightly progress.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\7: B. i. Prop. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\7: B. iii. Prop. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\7: B. iii. Prop. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\7: Scholium to Prop. 14. B. iii.]\r\n\r\nIn one celebrated instance, indeed, the deviation of the theory of\r\nthe _Principia_ from observation was wider, and more difficult to\r\nexplain; and as this deviation for a time resisted the analysis of\r\nEuler and Clairaut, as it had resisted the synthesis of Newton, it\r\nat one period staggered the faith of mathematicians in the exactness\r\nof the law of the inverse square of the distance. I speak of the\r\nMotion of the Moon's Apogee, a problem which has already been\r\nreferred to; and in which Newton's method, and all the methods which\r\ncould be devised for some time afterwards, gave only half the\r\nobserved motion; a circumstance which arose, as was discovered by\r\nClairaut in 1750, from the insufficiency of the method of\r\napproximation. Newton does not attempt to conceal this discrepancy.\r\nAfter calculating what the motion of apse would be, upon the\r\nassumption of a disturbing force of the same amount as that which\r\nthe sun exerts on the moon, he simply says,[42\\7] \"the apse of the\r\nmoon moves about twice as fast.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\7: B. i. Prop. 44, second edit. There is reason to believe,\r\nhowever, that Newton had, in his unpublished calculations, rectified\r\nthis discrepancy.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of doing what Newton did in this branch of the\r\nsubject, and the powers it must have required, may be judged of from\r\nwhat has already been stated;--that no one, with his methods, has\r\nyet been able to add any thing to his labors: few have undertaken to\r\nillustrate what he has written, and no great number have understood\r\nit throughout. The extreme complication of the forces, and of the\r\nconditions under which they act, makes the subject by far the most\r\nthorny walk of mathematics. It is necessary to resolve the action\r\n{411} into many elements, such as can be separated; to invent\r\nartifices for dealing with each of these; and then to recompound the\r\nlaws thus obtained into one common conception. The moon's motion\r\ncannot be conceived without comprehending a scheme more complex than\r\nthe Ptolemaic epicycles and eccentrics in their worst form; and the\r\ncomponent parts of the system are not, in this instance, mere\r\ngeometrical ideas, requiring only a distinct apprehension of\r\nrelations of space in order to hold them securely; they are the\r\nfoundations of mechanical notions, and require to be grasped so that\r\nwe can apply to them sound mechanical reasonings. Newton's\r\nsuccessors, in the next generation, abandoned the hope of imitating\r\nhim in this intense mental effort; they gave the subject over to the\r\noperation of algebraical reasoning, in which symbols think for us,\r\nwithout our dwelling constantly upon their meaning, and obtain for\r\nus the consequences which result from the relations of space and the\r\nlaws of force, however complicated be the conditions under which\r\nthey are combined. Even Newton's countrymen, though they were long\r\nbefore they applied themselves to the method thus opposed to his,\r\ndid not produce any thing which showed that they had mastered, or\r\ncould retrace, the Newtonian investigations.\r\n\r\nThus the Problem of Three Bodies,[43\\7] treated geometrically,\r\nbelongs exclusively to Newton; and the proofs of the mutual action\r\nof the sun, planets, and satellites, which depend upon such\r\nreasoning, could not be discovered by any one but him.\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\7: See the history of the _Problem of Three Bodies_,\r\n_ante_, in Book vi. Chap. vi. Sect. 7.]\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet done with his achievements on this subject; for\r\nsome of the most remarkable and beautiful of the reasonings which he\r\nconnected with this problem, belong to the next step of his\r\ngeneralization.\r\n\r\n5. _Mutual Attraction of all Particles of Matter._--That all the\r\nparts of the universe are drawn and held together by love, or\r\nharmony, or some affection to which, among other names, that of\r\nattraction may have been given, is an assertion which may very\r\npossibly have been made at various times, by speculators writing at\r\nrandom, and taking their chance of meaning and truth. The authors of\r\nsuch casual dogmas have generally nothing accurate or substantial,\r\neither in their conception of the general proposition, or in their\r\nreference to examples of it; and, therefore, their doctrines are no\r\nconcern of ours at present. But among those who were really the\r\nfirst to think of the mutual {412} attraction of matter, we cannot\r\nhelp noticing Francis Bacon; for his notions were so far from being\r\nchargeable with the looseness and indistinctness to which we have\r\nalluded, that he proposed an experiment[44\\7] which was to decide\r\nwhether the facts were so or not;--whether the gravity of bodies to\r\nthe earth arose from an attraction of the parts of matter towards\r\neach other, or was a tendency towards the centre of the earth. And\r\nthis experiment is, even to this day, one of the best which can be\r\ndevised, in order to exhibit the universal gravitation of matter: it\r\nconsists in the comparison of the rate of going of a clock in a deep\r\nmine, and on a high place. Huyghens, in his book _De Causâ\r\nGravitatis_, published in 1690, showed that the earth would have an\r\noblate form, in consequence of the action of the centrifugal force;\r\nbut his reasoning does not suppose gravity to arise from the mutual\r\nattraction of the parts of the earth. The apparent influence of the\r\nmoon upon the tides had long been remarked; but no one had made any\r\nprogress in truly explaining the mechanism of this influence; and\r\nall the analogies to which reference had been made, on this and\r\nsimilar subjects, as magnetic and other attractions, were rather\r\ndelusive than illustrative, since they represented the attraction as\r\nsomething peculiar in particular bodies, depending upon the nature\r\nof each body.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\7:  _Nov. Org._ Lib. ii. Aph. 36.]\r\n\r\nThat all such forces, cosmical and terrestrial, were the same single\r\nforce, and that this was nothing more than the insensible attraction\r\nwhich subsists between one stone and another, was a conception\r\nequally bold and grand; and would have been an incomprehensible\r\nthought, if the views which we have already explained had not\r\nprepared the mind for it. But the preceding steps having disclosed,\r\nbetween all the bodies of the universe, forces of the same kind as\r\nthose which produce the weight of bodies at the earth, and,\r\ntherefore, such as exist in every particle of terrestrial matter; it\r\nbecame an obvious question, whether such forces did not also belong\r\nto all particles of planetary matter, and whether this was not, in\r\nfact, the whole account of the forces of the solar system. But,\r\nsupposing this conjecture to be thus suggested, how formidable, on\r\nfirst appearance at least, was the undertaking of verifying it! For\r\nif this be so, every finite mass of matter exerts forces which are\r\nthe result of the infinitely numerous forces of its particles, these\r\nforces acting in different directions. It does not appear, at first\r\nsight, that the law by which the force is related to the distance,\r\nwill be the same for the particles as it is for the masses; and, in\r\nreality, it {413} is not so, except in special cases. And, again, in\r\nthe instance of any effect produced by the force of a body, how are\r\nwe to know whether the force resides in the whole mass as a unit, or\r\nin the separate particles? We may reason, as Newton does,[45\\7] that\r\nthe rule which proves gravity to belong universally to the planets,\r\nproves it also to belong to their parts; but the mind will not be\r\nsatisfied with this extension of the rule, except we can find\r\ndecisive instances, and calculate the effects of both suppositions,\r\nunder the appropriate conditions. Accordingly, Newton had to solve a\r\nnew series of problems suggested by this inquiry; and this he did.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\7: _Princip._ B. iii. Prop. 7.]\r\n\r\nThese solutions are no less remarkable for the mathematical power\r\nwhich they exhibit, than the other parts of the _Principia_. The\r\npropositions in which it is shown that the law of the inverse square\r\nfor the particles gives the same law for spherical masses, have that\r\nkind of beauty which might well have justified their being published\r\nfor their mathematical elegance alone, even if they had not applied to\r\nany real case. Great ingenuity is also employed in other instances, as\r\nin the case of spheroids of small eccentricity. And when the amount of\r\nthe mechanical action of masses of various forms has thus been\r\nassigned, the sagacity shown in tracing the results of such action in\r\nthe solar system is truly admirable; not only the general nature of\r\nthe effect being pointed out, but its quantity calculated. I speak in\r\nparticular of the reasonings concerning the Figure of the Earth, the\r\nTides, the Precession of the Equinoxes, the Regression of the Nodes of\r\na ring such as Saturn's; and of some effects which, at that time, had\r\nnot been ascertained even as facts of observation; for instance, the\r\ndifference of gravity in different latitudes, and the Nutation of the\r\nearth's axis. It is true, that in most of these cases, Newton's\r\nprocess could be considered only as a rude approximation. In one (the\r\nPrecession) he committed an error, and in all, his means of\r\ncalculation were insufficient. Indeed these are much more difficult\r\ninvestigations than the Problem of Three Bodies, in which three points\r\nact on each other by explicit laws. Up to this day, the resources of\r\nmodern analysis have been employed upon some of them with very partial\r\nsuccess; and the facts, in all of them, required to be accurately\r\nascertained and measured, a process which is not completed even now.\r\nNevertheless the form and nature of the conclusions which Newton did\r\nobtain, were such as to inspire a strong confidence in the competency\r\nof his theory to explain {414} all such phenomena as have been spoken\r\nof. We shall afterwards have to speak of the labors, undertaken in\r\norder to examine the phenomena more exactly, to which the theory gave\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the theory of the universal mutual gravitation of all\r\nthe particles of matter, according to the law of the inverse square\r\nof the distances, was conceived, its consequences calculated, and\r\nits results shown to agree with phenomena. It was found that this\r\ntheory took up all the facts of astronomy as far as they had\r\nhitherto been ascertained; while it pointed out an interminable\r\nvista of new facts, too minute or too complex for observation alone\r\nto disentangle, but capable of being detected when theory had\r\npointed out their laws, and of being used as criteria or\r\nconfirmations of the truth of the doctrine. For the same reasoning\r\nwhich explained the evection, variation, and annual equation of the\r\nmoon, showed that there must be many other inequalities besides\r\nthese; since these resulted from approximate methods of calculation,\r\nin which small quantities were neglected. And it was known that, in\r\nfact, the inequalities hitherto detected by astronomers did not give\r\nthe place of the moon with satisfactory accuracy; so that there was\r\nroom, among these hitherto untractable irregularities, for the\r\nadditional results of the theory. To work out this comparison was\r\nthe employment of the succeeding century; but Newton began it. Thus,\r\nat the end of the proposition in which he asserts,[46\\7] that \"all\r\nthe lunar motions and their irregularities follow from the\r\nprinciples here stated,\" he makes the observation which we have just\r\nmade; and gives, as examples, the different motions of the apogee\r\nand nodes, the difference of the change of the eccentricity, and the\r\ndifference of the moon's variation, according to the different\r\ndistances of the sun. \"But this inequality,\" he says, \"in\r\nastronomical calculations, is usually referred to the prosthaphæresis\r\nof the moon, and confounded with it.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\7: B. iii. Prop. 22.]\r\n\r\n_Reflections on the Discovery._--Such, then, is the great Newtonian\r\nInduction of Universal Gravitation, and such its history. It is\r\nindisputably and incomparably the greatest scientific discovery ever\r\nmade, whether we look at the advance which it involved, the extent\r\nof the truth disclosed, or the fundamental and satisfactory nature\r\nof this truth. As to the first point, we may observe that any one of\r\nthe five steps into which we have separated the doctrine, would, of\r\nitself, have been considered as an important advance;--would have\r\nconferred distinction on the persons who made it, and the time to\r\nwhich it belonged. All {415} the five steps made at once, formed not\r\na leap, but a flight,--not an improvement merely, but a\r\nmetamorphosis,--not an epoch, but a termination. Astronomy passed at\r\nonce from its boyhood to mature manhood. Again, with regard to the\r\nextent of the truth, we obtain as wide a generalization as our\r\nphysical knowledge admits, when we learn that every particle of\r\nmatter, in all times, places, and circumstances, attracts every\r\nother particle in the universe by one common law of action. And by\r\nsaying that the truth was of a fundamental and satisfactory nature,\r\nI mean that it assigned, not a rule merely, but a cause, for the\r\nheavenly motions; and that kind of cause which most eminently and\r\npeculiarly we distinctly and thoroughly conceive, namely, mechanical\r\nforce. Kepler's laws were merely _formal_ rules, governing the\r\ncelestial motions according to the relations of space, time, and\r\nnumber; Newton's was a _**causal_ law, referring these motions to\r\nmechanical reasons. It is no doubt conceivable that future\r\ndiscoveries may both extend and further explain Newton's\r\ndoctrines;--may make gravitation a case of some wider law, and may\r\ndisclose something of the mode in which it operates; questions with\r\nwhich Newton himself struggled. But, in the mean time, few persons\r\nwill dispute, that both in generality and profundity, both in width\r\nand depth, Newton's theory is altogether without a rival or\r\nneighbor.[47\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\7: The value and nature of this step have long been\r\ngenerally acknowledged wherever science is cultivated. Yet it would\r\nappear that there is, in one part of Europe, a school of\r\nphilosophers who contest the merit of this part of Newton's\r\ndiscoveries. \"Kepler,\" says a celebrated German metaphysician,*\r\n\"discovered the laws of free motion; a discovery of immortal glory.\r\nIt has since been the fashion to say that Newton first found out the\r\nproof of these rules. It has seldom happened that the glory of the\r\nfirst discoverer has been more unjustly transferred to another\r\nperson.\" It may appear strange that any one in the present day\r\nshould hold such language; but if we examine the reasons which this\r\nauthor gives, they will be found, I think, to amount to this: that\r\nhis mind is in the condition in which Kepler's was; and that the\r\nwhole range of mechanical ideas and modes of conception which made\r\nthe transition from Kepler and Newton possible, are extraneous to\r\nthe domain of his philosophy. Even this author, however, if I\r\nunderstand him rightly, recognizes Newton as the author of the\r\ndoctrine of Perturbations.\r\n\r\nI have given a further account of these views, in a Memoir _On Hegel's\r\nCriticism of Newton's Principia_. Cambridge Transactions, 1849.\r\n\r\n* Hegel, _Encyclopædia_, § 270.]\r\n\r\nThe requisite conditions of such a discovery in the mind of its author\r\nwere, in this as in other cases, the idea, and its comparison with\r\nfacts;--the conception of the law, and the moulding this conception in\r\nsuch a form as to correspond with known realities. The idea of\r\nmechanical {416} force as the cause of the celestial motions, had, as\r\nwe have seen, been for some time growing up in men's minds; had gone\r\non becoming more distinct and more general; and had, in some persons,\r\napproached the form in which it was entertained by Newton. Still, in\r\nthe mere conception of universal gravitation, Newton must have gone\r\nfar beyond his predecessors and contemporaries, both in generality and\r\ndistinctness; and in the inventiveness and sagacity with which he\r\ntraced the consequences of this conception, he was, as we have shown,\r\nwithout a rival, and almost without a second. As to the facts which he\r\nhad to include in his law, they had been accumulating from the very\r\nbirth of astronomy; but those which he had more peculiarly to take\r\nhold of were the facts of the planetary motions as given by Kepler,\r\nand those of the moon's motions as given by Tycho Brahe and Jeremy\r\nHorrox.\r\n\r\nWe find here occasion to make a remark which is important in its\r\nbearing on the nature of progressive science. What Newton thus used\r\nand referred to as _facts_, were the _laws_ which his predecessors had\r\nestablished. What Kepler and Horrox had put forth as \"theories,\" were\r\nnow established truths, fit to be used in the construction of other\r\ntheories. It is in this manner that one theory is built upon\r\nanother;--that we rise from particulars to generals, and from one\r\ngeneralization to another;--that we have, in short, successive steps\r\nof induction. As Newton's laws assumed Kepler's, Kepler's laws assumed\r\nas facts the results of the planetary theory of Ptolemy; and thus the\r\ntheories of each generation in the scientific world are (when\r\nthoroughly verified and established,**) the facts of the next\r\ngeneration. Newton's theory is the circle of generalization which\r\nincludes all the others;--the highest point of the inductive\r\nascent;--the catastrophe of the philosophic drama to which Plato had\r\nprologized;--the point to which men's minds had been journeying for\r\ntwo thousand years.\r\n\r\n_Character of Newton._--It is not easy to anatomize the constitution\r\nand the operations of the mind which makes such an advance in\r\nknowledge. Yet we may observe that there must exist in it, in an\r\neminent degree, the elements which compose the mathematical talent. It\r\nmust possess distinctness of intuition, tenacity and facility in\r\ntracing logical connection, fertility of invention, and a strong\r\ntendency to generalization. It is easy to discover indications of\r\nthese characteristics in Newton. The distinctness of his intuitions of\r\nspace, and we may add of force also, was seen in the amusements of his\r\nyouth; in his constructing clocks and mills, carts and dials, as well\r\nas the facility with which he {417} mastered geometry. This fondness\r\nfor handicraft employments, and for making models and machines,\r\nappears to be a common prelude of excellence in physical\r\nscience;[48\\7] probably on this very account, that it arises from the\r\ndistinctness of intuitive power with which the child conceives the\r\nshapes and the working of such material combinations. Newton's\r\ninventive power appears in the number and variety of the mathematical\r\nartifices and combinations which he devised, and of which his books\r\nare full. If we conceive the operation of the inventive faculty in the\r\nonly way in which it appears possible to conceive it;--that while some\r\nhidden source supplies a rapid stream of possible suggestions, the\r\nmind is on the watch to seize and detain any one of these which will\r\nsuit the case in hand, allowing the rest to pass by and be\r\nforgotten;--we shall see what extraordinary fertility of mind is\r\nimplied by so many successful efforts; what an innumerable host of\r\nthoughts must have been produced, to supply so many that deserved to\r\nbe selected. And since the selection is performed by tracing the\r\nconsequences of each suggestion, so as to compare them with the\r\nrequisite conditions, we see also what rapidity and certainty in\r\ndrawing conclusions the mind must possess as a talent, and what\r\nwatchfulness and patience as a habit.\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\7: As in Galileo, Hooke, Huyghens, and others.]\r\n\r\nThe hidden fountain of our unbidden thoughts is for us a mystery;\r\nand we have, in our consciousness, no standard by which we can\r\nmeasure our own talents; but our acts and habits are something of\r\nwhich we are conscious; and we can understand, therefore, how it was\r\nthat Newton could not admit that there was any difference between\r\nhimself and other men, except in his possession of such habits as we\r\nhave mentioned, perseverance and vigilance. When he was asked how he\r\nmade his discoveries, he answered, \"by always thinking about them;\"\r\nand at another time he declared that if he had done any thing, it\r\nwas due to nothing but industry and patient thought: \"I keep the\r\nsubject of my inquiry constantly before me, and wait till the first\r\ndawning opens gradually, by little and little, into a full and clear\r\nlight.\" No better account can be given of the nature of the mental\r\n_effort_ which gives to the philosopher the full benefit of his\r\npowers; but the natural _powers_ of men's minds are not on that\r\naccount the less different. There are many who might wait through\r\nages of darkness without being visited by any dawn.\r\n\r\nThe habit to which Newton thus, in some sense, owed his {418}\r\ndiscoveries, this constant attention to the rising thought, and\r\ndevelopment of its results in every direction, necessarily engaged\r\nand absorbed his spirit, and made him inattentive and almost\r\ninsensible to external impressions and common impulses. The stories\r\nwhich are told of his extreme absence of mind, probably refer to the\r\ntwo years during which he was composing his _Principia_, and thus\r\nfollowing out a train of reasoning the most fertile, the most\r\ncomplex, and the most important, which any philosopher had ever had\r\nto deal with. The magnificent and striking questions which, during\r\nthis period, he must have had daily rising before him; the perpetual\r\nsuccession of difficult problems of which the solution was necessary\r\nto his great object; may well have entirely occupied and possessed\r\nhim. \"He existed only to calculate and to think.\"[49\\7] Often, lost\r\nin meditation, he knew not what he did, and his mind appeared to\r\nhave quite forgotten its connection with the body. His servant\r\nreported that, on rising in a morning, he frequently sat a large\r\nportion of the day, half-dressed, on the side of his bed  and that\r\nhis meals waited on the table for hours before he came to take them.\r\nEven with his transcendent powers, to do what he did was almost\r\nirreconcilable with the common conditions of human life; and\r\nrequired the utmost devotion of thought, energy of effort, and\r\nsteadiness of will--the strongest character, as well as the highest\r\nendowments, which belong to man.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\7:  Biot.]\r\n\r\nNewton has been so universally considered as the greatest example of\r\na natural philosopher, that his moral qualities, as well as his\r\nintellect, have been referred to as models of the philosophical\r\ncharacter; and those who love to think that great talents are\r\nnaturally associated with virtue, have always dwelt with pleasure\r\nupon the views given of Newton by his contemporaries; for they have\r\nuniformly represented him as candid and humble, mild and good. We\r\nmay take as an example of the impressions prevalent about him in his\r\nown time, the expressions of Thomson, in the Poem on his\r\nDeath.[50\\7] {419}\r\n  Say ye who best can tell, ye happy few,\r\n  Who saw him in the softest lights of life,\r\n  All unwithheld, indulging to his friends\r\n  The vast unborrowed treasures of his mind,\r\n  Oh, speak the wondrous man! how mild, how calm\r\n  How greatly humble, how divinely good,\r\n  How firm established on eternal truth!\r\n  Fervent in doing well, with every nerve\r\n  Still pressing on, forgetful of the past,\r\n  And panting for perfection; far above\r\n  Those little cares and visionary joys\r\n  That so perplex the fond impassioned heart\r\n  Of ever-cheated, ever-trusting man.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\7: In the same strain we find the general voice of the\r\ntime. For instance, one of Loggan's \"Views of Cambridge\" is\r\ndedicated \"Isaaco Newtono . . Mathematico, Physico, Chymico\r\nconsummatissimo; nec minus suavitate morum  et candore animi . . .\r\nspectabili.\"\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the general current of such testimony, we have the\r\ncomplaints of Flamsteed, who ascribes to Newton angry language and\r\nharsh conduct in the matter of the publication of the Greenwich\r\nObservations, and of Whiston. Yet even Flamsteed speaks well of his\r\ngeneral disposition. Whiston was himself so weak and prejudiced that\r\nhis testimony is worth very little.]\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [In the first edition of the _Principia_, published in\r\n1687, Newton showed that the nature of all the then known\r\ninequalities of the moon, and in some cases, their quantities, might\r\nbe deduced from the principles which he laid down  but the\r\ndetermination of the amount and law of most of the inequalities was\r\ndeferred to a more favorable opportunity, when he might be furnished\r\nwith better astronomical observations. Such observations as he\r\nneeded for this purpose had been made by Flamsteed, and for these he\r\napplied, representing how much value their use would add to the\r\nobservations. \"If,\" he says, in 1694, \"you publish them without such\r\na theory to recommend them, they will only be thrown into the heap\r\nof the observations of former astronomers, till somebody shall arise\r\nthat by perfecting the theory of the moon shall discover your\r\nobservations to be exacter than the rest; but when that shall be,\r\nGod knows: I fear, not in your lifetime, if I should die before it\r\nis done. For I find this theory so very intricate, and the theory of\r\ngravity so necessary to it, that I am satisfied it will never be\r\nperfected but by somebody who understands the theory of gravity as\r\nwell, or better than I do.\" He obtained from Flamsteed the lunar\r\nobservations for which he applied, and by using these he framed the\r\nTheory of the Moon which is given as his in David Gregory's\r\n_Astronomiæ Elementa_.[51\\7] He also obtained from Flamsteed the\r\ndiameters of the planets as observed at various times, and the\r\ngreatest elongation of Jupiter's Satellites, both of which,\r\nFlamsteed says, he made use of in his _Principia_.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\7: In the Preface to a _Treatise on Dynamics_, Part i.,\r\npublished in 1836, I have endeavored to show that Newton's modes of\r\ndetermining several of the lunar inequalities admitted of an\r\naccuracy not very inferior to the modern analytical methods.]\r\n\r\nNewton, in his letters to Flamsteed in 1694 and 5, acknowledges this\r\nservice.[52\\7]**] {420}\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\7: The quarrel on the subject of the publication of\r\nFlamsteed's Observations took place at a later period. Flamsteed\r\nwished to have his Observations printed complete and entire. Halley,\r\nwho, under the authority of Newton and others, had the management of\r\nthe printing, made many alterations and omissions, which Flamsteed\r\nconsidered as deforming and spoiling the work. The advantages of\r\npublishing a _complete_ series of observations, now generally\r\nunderstood, were not then known to astronomers in general, though\r\nwell known to Flamsteed, and earnestly insisted upon in his\r\nremonstrances. The result was that Flamsteed published his\r\nObservations at his own expense, and finally obtained permission to\r\ndestroy the copies printed by Halley, which he did. In 1726, after\r\nFlamsteed's death, his widow applied to the Vice-Chancellor of\r\nOxford, requesting that the volume printed by Halley might be\r\nremoved out of the Bodleian Library, where it exists, as being\r\n\"nothing more than an erroneous abridgment of Mr. Flamsteed's\r\nworks,\" and unfit to see the light.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE EPOCH OF NEWTON.--RECEPTION OF THE NEWTONIAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_General Remarks._\r\n\r\nTHE doctrine of universal gravitation, like other great steps in\r\nscience, required a certain time to make its way into men's minds;\r\nand had to be confirmed, illustrated, and completed, by the labors\r\nof succeeding philosophers. As the discovery itself was great beyond\r\nformer example, the features of the natural sequel to the discovery\r\nwere also on a gigantic scale; and many vast and laborious trains of\r\nresearch, each of which might, in itself, be considered as forming a\r\nwide science, and several of which have occupied many profound and\r\nzealous inquirers from that time to our own day, come before us as\r\nparts only of the verification of Newton's Theory. Almost every\r\nthing that has been done, and is doing, in astronomy, falls\r\ninevitably under this description; and it is only when the\r\nastronomer travels to the very limits of his vast field of labor,\r\nthat he falls in with phenomena which do not acknowledge the\r\njurisdiction of the Newtonian legislation. We must give some account\r\nof the events of this part of the history of astronomy; but our\r\nnarrative must necessarily be extremely brief and imperfect; for the\r\nsubject is most large and copious, and our limits are fixed and\r\nnarrow. We have here to do with the history of discoveries, only so\r\nfar as it illustrates their philosophy. And though the {421}\r\nastronomical discoveries of the last century are by no means poor,\r\neven in interest of this kind, the generalizations which they\r\ninvolve are far less important for our object, in consequence of\r\nbeing included in a previous generalization. Newton shines out so\r\nbrightly, that all who follow seem faint and dim. It is not\r\nprecisely the case which the poet describes--\r\n  As in a theatre the eyes of men,\r\n  After some well-graced actor leaves the stage,\r\n  Are idly bent on him that enters next,\r\n  Thinking his prattle to be tedious:\r\nbut our eyes are at least less intently bent on the astronomers who\r\nsucceeded, and we attend to their communications with less\r\ncuriosity, because we know the end, if not the course of their\r\nstory; we know that their speeches have all closed with Newton's\r\nsublime declaration, asserted in some new form.\r\n\r\nStill, however, the account of the verification and extension of any\r\ngreat discovery is a highly important part of its history. In this\r\ninstance it is most important; both from the weight and dignity of\r\nthe theory concerned, and the ingenuity and extent of the methods\r\nemployed: and, of course, so long as the Newtonian theory still\r\nrequired verification, the question of the truth or falsehood of\r\nsuch a grand system of doctrines could not but excite the most\r\nintense curiosity. In what I have said, I am very far from wishing\r\nto depreciate the value of the achievements of modern astronomers,\r\nbut it is essential to my purpose to mark the subordination of\r\nnarrower to wider truths--the different character and import of the\r\nlabors of those who come before and after the promulgation of a\r\nmaster-truth. With this warning I now proceed to my narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Reception of the Newtonian Theory in England._\r\n\r\nTHERE appears to be a popular persuasion that great discoveries are\r\nusually received with a prejudiced and contentious opposition, and\r\nthe authors of them neglected or persecuted. The reverse of this was\r\ncertainly the case in England with regard to the discoveries of\r\nNewton. As we have already seen, even before they were published,\r\nthey were proclaimed by Halley to be something of transcendent\r\nvalue; and from the moment of their appearance, they rapidly made\r\ntheir way from one class of thinkers to another, nearly as fast as\r\nthe nature of men's intellectual capacity allows. Halley, Wren, and\r\nall the leading {422} members of the Royal Society, appear to have\r\nembraced the system immediately and zealously. Men whose pursuits\r\nhad lain rather in literature than in science, and who had not the\r\nknowledge and habits of mind which the strict study of the system\r\nrequired, adopted, on the credit of their mathematical friends, the\r\nhighest estimation of the _Principia_, and a strong regard for its\r\nauthor, as Evelyn, Locke, and Pepys. Only five years after the\r\npublication, the principles of the work were referred to from the\r\npulpit, as so incontestably proved that they might be made the basis\r\nof a theological argument. This was done by Dr. Bentley, when he\r\npreached the Boyle's Lectures in London, in 1692. Newton himself,\r\nfrom the time when his work appeared, is never mentioned except in\r\nterms of profound admiration; as, for instance, when he is called by\r\nDr. Bentley, in his sermon,[53\\7] \"That very excellent and divine\r\ntheorist, Mr. Isaac Newton.\" It appears to have been soon suggested,\r\nthat the Government ought to provide in some way for a person who\r\nwas so great an honor to the nation. Some delay took place with\r\nregard to this; but, in 1695, his friend Mr. Montague, afterwards\r\nEarl of Halifax, at that time Chancellor of the Exchequer, made him\r\nWarden of the Mint; and in 1699, he succeeded to the higher office\r\nof Master of the Mint, a situation worth £1200 or £1500 a year,\r\nwhich he filled to the end of his life. In 1703, he became President\r\nof the Royal Society, and was annually re-elected to this office\r\nduring the remaining twenty-five years of his life. In 1705, he was\r\nknighted in the Master's Lodge, at Trinity College, by Queen Anne,\r\nthen on a visit to the University of Cambridge. After the accession\r\nof George the First, Newton's conversation was frequently sought by\r\nthe Princess, afterwards Queen Caroline, who had a taste for\r\nspeculative studies, and was often heard to declare in public, that\r\nshe thought herself fortunate in living at a time which enabled her\r\nto enjoy the society of so great a genius. His fame, and the respect\r\npaid him, went on increasing to the end of his life; and when, in\r\n1727, full of years and glory, his earthly career was ended, his\r\ndeath was mourned as a national calamity, with the forms usually\r\nconfined to royalty. His body lay in state in the Jerusalem chamber;\r\nhis pall was borne by the first nobles of the land  and his earthly\r\nremains were deposited in the centre of Westminster Abbey, in the\r\nmidst of the memorials of the greatest and wisest men whom England\r\nhas produced.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\7: Serm. vii. 221.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be superfluous to say a word or two on the reception of\r\n{423} his philosophy in the universities of England. These are often\r\nrepresented as places where bigotry and ignorance resist, as long as\r\nit is possible to resist, the invasion of new truths. We cannot\r\ndoubt that such opinions have prevailed extensively, when we find an\r\nintelligent and generally temperate writer, like the late Professor\r\nPlayfair of Edinburgh, so far possessed by them, as to be incapable\r\nof seeing, or interpreting, in any other way, any facts respecting\r\nOxford and Cambridge. Yet, notwithstanding these opinions, it will\r\nbe found that, in the English universities, new views, whether in\r\nscience or in other subjects, have been introduced as soon as they\r\nwere clearly established;--that they have been diffused from the few\r\nto the many more rapidly there than elsewhere occurs;--and that from\r\nthese points, the light of newly-discovered truths has most usually\r\nspread over the land. In most instances undoubtedly there has been\r\nsomething of a struggle, on such occasions, between the old and the\r\nnew opinions. Few men's minds can at once shake off a familiar and\r\nconsistent system of doctrines, and adopt a novel and strange set of\r\nprinciples as soon as presented; but all can see that one change\r\nproduces many, and that change, in itself, is a source of\r\ninconvenience and danger. In the case of the admission of the\r\nNewtonian opinions into Cambridge and Oxford, however, there are no\r\ntraces even of a struggle. Cartesianism had never struck its roots\r\ndeep in this country; that is, the peculiar hypotheses of Descartes.\r\nThe Cartesian books, such, for instance, as that of Rohault, were\r\nindeed in use; and with good reason, for they contained by far the\r\nbest treatises on most of the physical sciences, such as Mechanics,\r\nHydrostatics, Optics, and Formal Astronomy, which could then be\r\nfound. But I do not conceive that the Vortices were ever dwelt upon\r\nas a matter of importance in our academic teaching. At any rate, if\r\nthey were brought among us, they were soon dissipated. Newton's\r\nCollege, and his University, exulted in his fame, and did their\r\nutmost to honor and aid him. He was exempted by the king from the\r\nobligation of taking orders, under which the fellows of Trinity\r\nCollege in general are; by his college he was relieved from all\r\noffices which might interfere, however slightly, with his studious\r\nemployments, though he resided within the walls of the society\r\nthirty-five years, almost without the interruption of a month.[54\\7]\r\nBy the University he was elected their representative in parliament\r\nin 1688, {424} and again in 1701; and though he was rejected in the\r\ndissolution of 1705, those who opposed him acknowledged him[55\\7] to\r\nbe \"the glory of the University and nation,\" but considered the\r\nquestion as a political one, and Newton as sent \"to tempt them from\r\ntheir duty, by the great and just veneration they had for him.\"\r\nInstruments and other memorials, valued because they belonged to\r\nhim, are still preserved in his college, along with the tradition of\r\nthe chambers which he occupied.\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\7: His name is nowhere found on the college-books, as\r\nappointed to any of the offices which usually pass down the list of\r\nresident fellows in rotation. This might be owing in part, however,\r\nto his being Lucasian Professor. The constancy of his residence in\r\ncollege appears from the _exit_ and _redit_ book of that time, which\r\nis still preserved.]\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\7: A pamphlet by Styan Thurlby.]\r\n\r\nThe most active and powerful minds at Cambridge became at once\r\ndisciples and followers of Newton. Samuel Clarke, afterwards his\r\nfriend, defended in the public schools a thesis taken from his\r\nphilosophy, as early as 1694; and in 1697 published an edition of\r\nRohault's _Physics_, with notes, in which Newton is frequently\r\nreferred to with expressions of profound respect, though the leading\r\ndoctrines of the _Principia_ are not introduced till a later\r\nedition, in 1703. In 1699, Bentley, whom we have already mentioned\r\nas a Newtonian, became Master of Trinity College; and in the same\r\nyear, Whiston, another of Newton's disciples, was appointed his\r\ndeputy as professor of mathematics. Whiston delivered the Newtonian\r\ndoctrines, both from the professor's chair, and in works written for\r\nthe use of the University; yet it is remarkable that a taunt\r\nrespecting the late introduction of the Newtonian system into the\r\nCambridge course of education, has been founded on some peevish\r\nexpressions which he uses in his Memoirs, written at a period when,\r\nhaving incurred expulsion from his professorship and the University,\r\nhe was naturally querulous and jaundiced in his views. In 1709-10,\r\nDr. Laughton, who was tutor in Clare Hall, procured himself to be\r\nappointed moderator of the University disputations, in order to\r\npromote the diffusion of the new mathematical doctrines. By this\r\ntime the first edition of the _Principia_ was become rare, and\r\nfetched a great price. Bentley urged Newton to publish a new one;\r\nand Cotes, by far the first, at that time, of the mathematicians of\r\nCambridge, undertook to superintend the printing, and the edition\r\nwas accordingly published in 1713.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [I perceive that my accomplished German translator,\r\nLittrow, has incautiously copied the insinuations of some modern\r\nwriters to the effect that Clarke's reference to Newton, in his\r\nEdition of Rohault's _Physics_, was a mode of introducing Newtonian\r\ndoctrines covertly, when it was not allowed him to introduce such\r\nnovelties {425} openly. I am quite sure that any one who looks into\r\nthis matter will see that this supposition of any unwillingness at\r\nCambridge to receive Newton's doctrine is quite absurd, and can\r\nprove nothing but the intense prejudices of those who maintain such\r\nan opinion. Newton received and held his professorship amid the\r\nunexampled admiration of all contemporary members of the University.\r\nWhiston, who is sometimes brought as an evidence against Cambridge\r\non this point, says, \"I with immense pains set myself with the\r\nutmost zeal to the study of Sir Isaac Newton's wonderful discoveries\r\nin his _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_, one or two of\r\nwhich _lectures I had heard him read in the public schools_, though\r\nI understood them not at the time.\" As to Rohault's _Physics_, it\r\nreally did contain the best mechanical philosophy of the time;--the\r\ndoctrines which were held by Descartes in common with Galileo, and\r\nwith all the sound mathematicians who succeeded them. Nor does it\r\nlook like any great antipathy to novelty in the University of\r\nCambridge, that this book, which was quite as novel in its doctrines\r\nas Newton's _Principia_, and which had only been published at Paris\r\nin 1671, had obtained a firm hold on the University in less than\r\ntwenty years. Nor is there any attempt made in Clarke's notes to\r\nconceal the novelty of Newton's discoveries, but on the contrary,\r\nadmiration is claimed for them as new.\r\n\r\nThe promptitude with which the Mathematicians of the University of\r\nCambridge adopted the best parts of the mechanical philosophy of\r\nDescartes, and the greater philosophy of Newton, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, has been paralleled in our own times, in the promptitude\r\nwith which they have adopted and followed into their consequences\r\nthe Mathematical Theory of Heat of Fourier and Laplace, and the\r\nUndulatory Theory of Light of Young and Fresnel.\r\n\r\nIn Newton's College, we possess, besides the memorials of him\r\nmentioned above (which include two locks of his silver-white hair),\r\na paper in his own handwriting, describing the preparatory reading\r\nwhich was necessary in order that our College students might be able\r\nto read the _Principia_. I have printed this paper in the Preface to\r\nmy Edition of the First Three Sections of the _Principia_ in the\r\noriginal Latin (1846).\r\n\r\nBentley, who had expressed his admiration for Newton in his Boyle's\r\nLectures in 1692, was made Master of the College in 1699, as I have\r\nstated; and partly, no doubt, in consequence of the Newtonian\r\nsermons which he had preached. In his administration of the College,\r\nhe zealously stimulated and assisted the exertions of Cotes,\r\nWhiston, and other disciples of Newton. Smith, Bentley's successor\r\nas Master of {426} the College, erected a statue of Newton in the\r\nCollege Chapel (a noble work of Roubiliac), with the inscription,\r\n_Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit._]\r\n\r\nAt Oxford, David Gregory and Halley, both zealous and distinguished\r\ndisciples of Newton, obtained the Savilian professorships of\r\nastronomy and geometry in 1691 and 1703.\r\n\r\nDavid Gregory's _Astronomiæ Physicæ et Geometricæ Elementa_ issued\r\nfrom the Oxford Press in 1702. The author, in the first sentence of\r\nthe Preface, states his object to be to explain the mechanics of the\r\nuniverse (Physica Cœlestis), which Isaac Newton, the Prince of\r\nGeometers, has carried to a point of elevation which all look up to\r\nwith admiration. And this design is executed by a full exposition of\r\nthe Newtonian doctrines and their results. Keill, a pupil of\r\nGregory, followed his tutor to Oxford, and taught the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy there in 1700, being then Deputy Sedleian Professor. He\r\nillustrated his lectures by experiments, and published an\r\nIntroduction to the _Principia_ which is not out of use even yet.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the Newtonian philosophy was accepted with great\r\nalacrity, as appears by the instances of David Gregory and Keill.\r\nDavid Gregory was professor at Edinburgh before he removed to Oxford,\r\nand was succeeded there by his brother James. The latter had, as early\r\nas 1690, printed a thesis, containing in twenty-two propositions, a\r\ncompend of Newton's _Principia_.[56\\7] Probably these were intended as\r\ntheses for academical disputations; as Laughton at Cambridge\r\nintroduced the Newtonian philosophy into these exercises. The formula\r\nat Cambridge, in use till very recently in these disputations, was\r\n\"_Rectè statuit Newtonus de Motu Lunæ_;\" or the like.\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\7: See Hutton's _Math. Dict._, art. _James Gregory_. If it\r\nfell in with my plan to notice derivative works, I might speak of\r\nMaclaurin's admirable _Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Discoveries_,\r\npublished in 1748. This is still one of the best books on the\r\nsubject. The late Professor Rigaud's _Historical Essay on the First\r\nPublication of Sir Isaac Newton's \"Principia\"_ (Oxf. 1838) contains\r\na careful and candid view of the circumstances of that event.]\r\n\r\nThe general diffusion of these opinions in England took place, not\r\nonly by means of books, but through the labors of various\r\nexperimental lecturers, like Desaguliers, who removed from Oxford to\r\nLondon in 1713; when he informs us,[57\\7] that \"he found the\r\nNewtonian philosophy generally received among persons of all ranks\r\nand professions, and even among the ladies by the help of\r\nexperiments.\" {427}\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\7: Desag. _Pref._]\r\n\r\nWe might easily trace in our literature indications of the gradual\r\nprogress of the Newtonian doctrines. For instance, in the earlier\r\neditions of Pope's _Dunciad_, this couplet occurred, in the\r\ndescription of the effects of the reign of Dulness:\r\n  Philosophy, that reached the heavens before,\r\n  Shrinks to her hidden cause, and is no more.\r\n\"And this,\" says his editor, Warburton, \"was intended as a censure\r\non the Newtonian philosophy. For the poet had been misled by the\r\nprejudices of foreigners, as if that philosophy had recurred to the\r\noccult qualities of Aristotle. This was the idea he received of it\r\nfrom a man educated much abroad, who had read every thing, but every\r\nthing superficially.[58\\7] When I hinted to him how he had been\r\nimposed upon, he changed the lines with great pleasure into a\r\ncompliment (as they now stand) on that divine genius, and a satire\r\non that very folly by which he himself had been misled.\" In 1743 it\r\nwas printed,\r\n  Philosophy, that leaned on heaven before,\r\n  Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.\r\nThe Newtonians repelled the charge of dealing in occult\r\ncauses;[59\\7] and, referring gravity to the will of the Deity, as\r\nthe First Cause, assumed a superiority over those whose philosophy\r\nrested in second causes.\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\7: I presume Bolingbroke is here meant.]\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\7: See Cotes's Pref. to the _Principia_.]\r\n\r\nTo the cordial reception of the Newtonian theory by the English\r\nastronomers, there is only one conspicuous exception; which is,\r\nhowever, one of some note, being no other than Flamsteed, the\r\nAstronomer Royal, a most laborious and exact observer. Flamsteed at\r\nfirst listened with complacency to the promises of improvements in\r\nthe Lunar Tables, which the new doctrines held forth, and was\r\nwilling to assist Newton, and to receive assistance from him. But\r\nafter a time, he lost his respect for Newton's theory, and ceased to\r\ntake any interest in it. He then declared to one of his\r\ncorrespondents,[60\\7] \"I have determined to lay these crotchets of\r\nSir Isaac Newton's wholly aside.\" We need not, however, find any\r\ndifficulty in this, if we recollect that Flamsteed, though a good\r\nobserver, was no philosopher;--never understood by a Theory any\r\nthing more than a Formula which should predict results;--and was\r\nincapable of comprehending the object of Newton's theory, which was\r\nto assign causes as well as rules, and to satisfy the conditions of\r\nMechanics as well as of Geometry. {428}\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\7: Baily's _Account of Flamsteed, &c._, p. 309.]\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [I do not see any reason to retract what was thus said; but\r\nit ought perhaps to be distinctly said that on these very accounts\r\nFlamsteed's rejection of Newton's rules did not imply a denial of\r\nthe doctrine of gravitation. In the letter above quoted, Flamsteed\r\nsays that he has been employed upon the Moon, and that \"the heavens\r\nreject that equation of Sir I. Newton which Gregory and Newton\r\ncalled his sixth: I had then [when he wrote before] compared but 72\r\nof my observations with the tables, now I have examined above 100\r\nmore. I find them all firm in the same, and the seventh [equation]\r\ntoo.\" And thereupon he comes to the determination above stated.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier period Flamsteed, as I have said, had received\r\nNewton's suggestions with great deference, and had regulated his own\r\nobservations and theories with reference to them. The calculation of\r\nthe lunar inequalities upon the theory of gravitation was found by\r\nNewton and his successors to be a more difficult and laborious task\r\nthan he had anticipated, and was not performed without several\r\ntrials and errors. One of the equations was at first published (in\r\nGregory's _Astronomiæ Elementa_) with a wrong sign. And when Newton\r\nhad done all, Flamsteed found that the rules were far from coming up\r\nto the degree of accuracy which had been claimed for them, that they\r\ncould give the moon's place true to 2 or 3 minutes. It was not till\r\nconsiderably later that this amount of exactness was attained.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Baily, to whom astronomy and astronomical literature\r\nare so deeply indebted, in his _Supplement to the Account of\r\nFlamsteed_, has examined with great care and great candor the\r\nassertion that Flamsteed did not understand Newton's Theory. He\r\nremarks, very justly, that what Newton himself at first presented as\r\nhis Theory, might more properly be called Rules for computing lunar\r\ntables, than a physical Theory in the modern acceptation of the\r\nterm. He shows, too, that Flamsteed had read the _Principia_ with\r\nattention.[61\\7] Nor do I doubt that many considerable\r\nmathematicians gave the same imperfect assent to Newton's doctrine\r\nwhich Flamsteed did. But when we find that others, as Halley, David\r\nGregory, and Cotes, at once not only saw in the doctrine a source of\r\ntrue formulæ, but also a magnificent physical discovery, we are\r\nobliged, I think, to make Flamsteed, in this respect, an exception\r\nto the first class of astronomers of his own time.\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\7: _Supp._ p. 691.]\r\n\r\nMr. Baily's suggestion that the annual equations for the corrections\r\nof the lunar apogee and node were collected from Flamsteed's tables\r\n{429} and observations independently of their suggestion by Newton\r\nas the results of Theory (_Supp._ p. 692, Note, and p. 698), appears\r\nto me not to be adequately supported by the evidence given.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Reception of the Newtonian Theory abroad._\r\n\r\nTHE reception of the Newtonian theory on the Continent, was much\r\nmore tardy and unwilling than in its native island. Even those whose\r\nmathematical attainments most fitted them to appreciate its proofs,\r\nwere prevented by some peculiarity of view from adopting it as a\r\nsystem; as Leibnitz, Bernoulli, Huyghens; who all clung to one\r\nmodification or other of the system of vortices. In France, the\r\nCartesian system had obtained a wide and popular reception, having\r\nbeen recommended by Fontenelle with the graces of his style; and its\r\nempire was so firm and well established in that country, that it\r\nresisted for a long time the pressure of Newtonian arguments.\r\nIndeed, the Newtonian opinions had scarcely any disciples in France,\r\ntill Voltaire asserted their claims, on his return from England in\r\n1728: until then, as he himself says, there were not twenty\r\nNewtonians out of England.\r\n\r\nThe hold which the Philosophy of Descartes had upon the minds of his\r\ncountrymen is, perhaps, not surprising. He really had the merit, a\r\ngreat one in the history of science, of having completely overturned\r\nthe Aristotelian system, and introduced the philosophy of matter and\r\nmotion. In all branches of mixed mathematics, as we have already\r\nsaid, his followers were the best guides who had yet appeared. His\r\nhypothesis of vortices, as an explanation of the celestial motions,\r\nhad an apparent advantage over the Newtonian doctrine, in this\r\nrespect;--that it referred effects to the most intelligible, or at\r\nleast most familiar kinds of mechanical causation, namely, pressure\r\nand impulse. And above all, the system was acceptable to most minds,\r\nin consequence of being, as was pretended, deduced from a few simple\r\nprinciples by necessary consequences; and of being also directly\r\nconnected with metaphysical and theological speculations. We may\r\nadd, that it was modified by its mathematical adherents in such a\r\nway as to remove most of the objections to it. A vortex revolving\r\nabout a centre could be constructed, or at least it was supposed\r\nthat it could be constructed, so as to produce a tendency of bodies\r\nto the centre. In all cases, therefore, where a central force acted,\r\na vortex was supposed; but in reasoning to the results of this\r\nhypothesis, it was {430} easy to leave out of sight all other\r\neffects of the vortex, and to consider only the central force; and\r\nwhen this was done, the Cartesian mathematician could apply to his\r\nproblems a mechanical principle of some degree of consistency. This\r\nreflection will, in some degree, account for what at first seems so\r\nstrange;--the fact that the language of the French mathematicians is\r\nCartesian, for almost half a century after the publication of the\r\n_Principia_ of Newton.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a controversy between the two opinions going on\r\nall this time, and every day showed the insurmountable difficulties\r\nunder which the Cartesians labored. Newton, in the _Principia_, had\r\ninserted a series of propositions, the object of which was to prove,\r\nthat the machinery of vortices could not be accommodated to one part\r\nof the celestial phenomena, without contradicting another part. A\r\nmore obvious difficulty was the case of gravity of the earth; if\r\nthis force arose, as Descartes asserted, from the rotation of the\r\nearth's vortex about its axis, it ought to tend directly to the\r\naxis, and not to the centre. The asserters of vortices often tried\r\ntheir skill in remedying this vice in the hypothesis, but never with\r\nmuch success. Huyghens supposed the ethereal matter of the vortices\r\nto revolve about the centre in all directions; Perrault made the\r\nstrata of the vortex increase in velocity of rotation as they recede\r\nfrom the centre; Saurin maintained that the circumambient resistance\r\nwhich comprises the vortex will produce a pressure passing through\r\nthe centre. The elliptic form of the orbits of the planets was\r\nanother difficulty. Descartes had supposed the vortices themselves\r\nto be oval  but others, as John Bernoulli, contrived ways of having\r\nelliptical motion in a circular vortex.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical prize-questions proposed by the French Academy,\r\nnaturally brought the two sets of opinions into conflict. The\r\nCartesian memoir of John Bernoulli, to which we have just referred,\r\nwas the one which gained the prize in 1730. It not unfrequently\r\nhappened that the Academy, as if desirous to show its impartiality,\r\ndivided the prize between the Cartesians and Newtonians. Thus in\r\n1734, the question being, the cause of the inclination of the orbits\r\nof the planets, the prize was shared between John Bernoulli, whose\r\nMemoir was founded on the system of vortices, and his son Daniel,\r\nwho was a Newtonian. The last act of homage of this kind to the\r\nCartesian system was performed in 1740, when the prize on the\r\nquestion of the Tides was distributed between Daniel Bernoulli,\r\nEuler, Maclaurin, and Cavallieri; the last of whom had tried to\r\npatch up and amend the Cartesian hypothesis on this subject. {431}\r\n\r\nThus the Newtonian system was not adopted in France till the\r\nCartesian generation had died off; Fontenelle, who was secretary to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, and who lived till 1756, died a Cartesian.\r\nThere were exceptions; for instance, Delisle, an astronomer who was\r\nselected by Peter the Great of Russia, to found the Academy of St\r\nPetersburg; who visited England in 1724, and to whom Newton then\r\ngave his picture, and Halley his Tables. But in general, during the\r\ninterval, that country and this had a national difference of creed\r\non physical subjects. Voltaire, who visited England in 1727, notices\r\nthis difference in his lively manner. \"A Frenchman who arrives in\r\nLondon, finds a great alteration in philosophy, as in other things.\r\nHe left the world full [**a _plenum_], he finds it empty. At Paris\r\nyou see the universe composed of vortices of subtle matter, in\r\nLondon we see nothing of the kind. With you it is the pressure of\r\nthe moon which causes the tides of the sea, in England it is the sea\r\nwhich gravitates towards the moon; so that when you think the moon\r\nought to give us high water, these gentlemen believe that you ought\r\nto have low water; which unfortunately we cannot test by experience;\r\nfor in order to do that, we should have examined the Moon and the\r\nTides at the moment of the creation. You will observe also that the\r\nsun, which in France has nothing to do with the business, here comes\r\nin for a quarter of it. Among you Cartesians, all is done by an\r\nimpulsion which one does not well understand; with the Newtonians,\r\nit is done by an attraction of which we know the cause no better. At\r\nParis you fancy the earth shaped like a melon, at London it is\r\nflattened on the two sides.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Voltaire himself as we have said, who was mainly instrumental\r\nin giving the Newtonian doctrines currency in France. He was at first\r\nrefused permission to print his _Elements of the Newtonian\r\nPhilosophy_, by the Chancellor, D'Aguesseaux, who was a Cartesian; but\r\nafter the appearance of this work in 1738, and of other writings by\r\nhim on the same subject, the Cartesian edifice, already without real\r\nsupport or consistency, crumbled to pieces and disappeared. The first\r\nMemoir in the _Transactions of the French Academy_ in which the\r\ndoctrine of central force is applied to the solar system, is one by\r\nthe Chevalier de Louville in 1720, _On the Construction and Theory of\r\nTables of the Sun_. In this, however, the mode of explaining the\r\nmotions of the planets by means of an original impulse and an\r\nattractive force is attributed to Kepler, not to Newton. The first\r\nMemoir which refers to the universal gravitation of matter is by\r\nMaupertuis, in {432} 1736. But Newton was not unknown or despised in\r\nFrance till this time. In 1699 he was admitted one of the very small\r\nnumber of foreign associates of the French Academy of Sciences. Even\r\nFontenelle, who, as we have said, never adopted his opinions, spoke of\r\nhim in a worthy manner, in the _Eloge_ which he composed on the\r\noccasion of his death. At a much earlier period too, Fontenelle did\r\nhomage to his fame. The following passage refers, I presume, to\r\nNewton. In the _History_ of the Academy for 1708, which is written by\r\nthe secretary, he says,[62\\7] in referring to the difficulty which the\r\ncomets occasion in the Cartesian hypothesis: \"We might relieve\r\nourselves at once from all the embarrassment which arises from the\r\ndirections of these motions, by suppressing, as has been done _by one\r\nof the greatest geniuses of the age_, all this immense fluid matter,\r\nwhich we commonly suppose between the planets, and conceiving them\r\nsuspended in a perfect void.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\7: _Hist. Ac. Sc._ 1708. p. 103.]\r\n\r\nComets, as the above passage implies, were a kind of artillery which\r\nthe Cartesian _plenum_ could not resist. When it appeared that the\r\npaths of such wanderers traversed the vortices in all directions, it\r\nwas impossible to maintain that these imaginary currents governed\r\nthe movements of bodies immersed in them  and the mechanism ceased\r\nto have any real efficacy. Both these phenomena of comets, and many\r\nothers, became objects of a stronger and more general interest, in\r\nconsequence of the controversy between the rival parties; and thus\r\nthe prevalence of the Cartesian system did not seriously impede the\r\nprogress of sound knowledge. In some cases, no doubt, it made men\r\nunwilling to receive the truth, as in the instance of the deviation\r\nof the comets from the zodiacal motion; and again, when Römer\r\ndiscovered that light was not instantaneously propagated. But it\r\nencouraged observation and calculation, and thus forwarded the\r\nverification and extension of the Newtonian system; of which process\r\nwe must now consider some of the incidents. {433}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE EPOCH OF NEWTON, CONTINUED.--VERIFICATION AND\r\nCOMPLETION OF THE NEWTONIAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Division of the Subject._\r\n\r\nTHE verification of the Law of Universal Gravitation as the\r\ngoverning principle of all cosmical phenomena, led, as we have\r\nalready stated, to a number of different lines of research, all long\r\nand difficult. Of these we may treat successively, the motions of\r\nthe Moon, of the Sun, of the Planets, of the Satellites, of Comets;\r\nwe may also consider separately the Secular Inequalities, which at\r\nfirst sight appear to follow a different law from the other changes;\r\nwe may then speak of the results of the principle as they affect\r\nthis Earth, in its Figure, in the amount of Gravity at different\r\nplaces, and in the phenomena of the Tides. Each of these subjects\r\nhas lent its aid to confirm the general law: but in each the\r\nconfirmation has had its peculiar difficulties, and has its separate\r\nhistory. Our sketch of this history must be very rapid, for our aim\r\nis only to show what is the kind and course of the confirmation\r\nwhich such a theory demands and receives.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason we pass over many events of this period which\r\nare highly important in the history of astronomy. They have lost\r\nmuch of their interest for us, and even for common readers, because\r\nthey are of a class with which we are already familiar, truths\r\nincluded in more general truths to which our eyes now most readily\r\nturn. Thus, the discovery of new satellites and planets is but a\r\nrepetition of what was done by Galileo: the determination of their\r\nnodes and apses, the reduction of their motions to the law of the\r\nellipse, is but a fresh exemplification of the discoveries of\r\nKepler. Otherwise, the formation of Tables of the satellites of\r\nJupiter and Saturn, the discovery of the eccentricities of the\r\norbits, and of the motions of the nodes and apses, by Cassini,\r\nHalley, and others, would rank with the great achievements in\r\nastronomy. Newton's peculiar advance in the _Tables_ of the\r\ncelestial motions is the introduction of Perturbations. To these\r\nmotions, so affected, we now proceed. {434}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to the Moon._\r\n\r\nTHE Motions of the Moon may be first spoken of, as the most obvious\r\nand the most important of the applications of the Newtonian Theory.\r\nThe verification of such a theory consists, as we have seen in\r\nprevious cases, in the construction of Tables derived from the\r\ntheory, and the comparison of these with observation. The\r\nadvancement of astronomy would alone have been a sufficient motive\r\nfor this labor; but there were other reasons which urged it on with\r\na stronger impulse. A perfect Lunar Theory, if the theory could be\r\nperfected, promised to supply a method of finding the Longitude of\r\nany place on the earth's surface; and thus the verification of a\r\ntheory which professed to be complete in its foundations, was\r\nidentified with an object of immediate practical use to navigators\r\nand geographers, and of vast acknowledged value. A good method for\r\nthe near discovery of the longitude had been estimated by nations\r\nand princes at large sums of money. The Dutch were willing to tempt\r\nGalileo to this task by the offer of a chain of gold: Philip the\r\nThird of Spain had promised a reward for this object still\r\nearlier;[63\\7] the parliament of England, in 1714, proposed a\r\nrecompense of 20,000_l._ sterling; the Regent Duke of Orléans, two\r\nyears afterwards, offered 100,000 francs for the same purpose. These\r\nprizes, added to the love of truth and of fame, kept this object\r\nconstantly before the eyes of mathematicians, during the first half\r\nof the last century.\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\7: Del. _A. M._ i. 39, 66.]\r\n\r\nIf the Tables could be so constructed as to represent the moon's\r\nreal place in the heavens with extreme precision, as it would be\r\nseen from a _standard_ observatory, the observation of her apparent\r\nplace, as seen from any other point of the earth's surface, would\r\nenable the observer to find his longitude from the standard point.\r\nThe motions of the moon had hitherto so ill agreed with the best\r\nTables, that this method failed altogether. Newton had discovered\r\nthe ground of this want of agreement. He had shown that the same\r\nforce which produces the Evection, Variation, and Annual Equation,\r\nmust produce also a long series of other Inequalities, of various\r\nmagnitudes and cycles, which perpetually drag the moon before or\r\nbehind the place where she would be sought by an astronomer who knew\r\nonly of those principal and notorious inequalities. But to calculate\r\nand apply the new inequalities, was no slight undertaking. {435}\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of the _Principia_ in 1687, Newton had not\r\ngiven any calculations of new inequalities affecting the longitude\r\nof the moon. But in David Gregory's _Elements of Physical and\r\nGeometrical Astronomy_, published in 1702, is inserted[64\\7]\r\n\"Newton's Lunar Theory as applied by him to Practice;\" in which the\r\ngreat discoverer has given the results of his calculations of eight\r\nof the lunar Equations, their quantities, epochs, and periods. These\r\ncalculations were for a long period the basis of new Tables of the\r\nMoon, which were published by various persons;[65\\7] as by Delisle\r\nin 1715 or 1716, Grammatici at Ingoldstadt in 1726, Wright in 1732,\r\nAngelo Capelli at Venice in 1733, Dunthorne at Cambridge in 1739.\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\7: P. 332.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\7: Lalande, 1457.]\r\n\r\nFlamsteed had given Tables of the Moon upon Horrox's theory in 1681,\r\nand wished to improve them; and though, as we have seen, he would\r\nnot, or could not, accept Newton's doctrines in their whole extent,\r\nNewton communicated his theory to the observer in the shape in which\r\nhe could understand it and use it:[66\\7] and Flamsteed employed\r\nthese directions in constructing new Lunar Tables, which he called\r\nhis _Theory_.[67\\7] These Tables were not published till long after\r\nhis death, by Le Monnier at Paris in 1746. They are said, by\r\nLalande,[68\\7] not to differ much from Halley's. Halley's Tables of\r\nthe Moon were printed in 1719 or 1720, but not published till after\r\nhis death in 1749. They had been founded on Flamsteed's observations\r\nand his own; and when, in 1720, Halley succeeded Flamsteed in the\r\npost of Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, and conceived that he had the\r\nmeans of much improving what he had done before, he began by\r\nprinting what he had already executed.[69\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\7: Baily. _Account of Flamsteed_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\7: P. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\7: Lal. 1459.]\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\7: Mr. Baily* says that Mayer's _Nouvelles Tables de la\r\nLune_ in **1753, published upwards of fifty years after Gregory's\r\n_Astronomy_, may be considered as the first lunar tables formed\r\n_solely_ on Newton's principles. Though Wright in 1732 published\r\n_New and Correct Tables of the Lunar Motions according to the\r\nNewtonian Theory_, Newton's rules were in them only partially\r\nadopted. In 1735 Leadbetter published his _Uranoscopia_, in which\r\nthose rules were more fully followed. But these _Newtonian Tables_\r\ndid not supersede Flamsteed's Horroxian Tables, till both were\r\nsupplanted by those of Mayer.\r\n\r\n* _Supp._ p. 702.]\r\n\r\nBut Halley had long proposed a method, different from that of\r\nNewton, but marked by great ingenuity, for amending the Lunar\r\nTables. He proposed to do this by the use of a cycle, which we have\r\nmentioned as one of the earliest discoveries in astronomy;--the\r\nPeriod of 223 lunations, or eighteen years and eleven days, the\r\nChaldean {436} Saros. This period was anciently used for predicting\r\nthe eclipses of the sun and moon; for those eclipses which happen\r\nduring this period, are repeated again in the same order, and with\r\nnearly the same circumstances, after the expiration of one such\r\nperiod and the commencement of a second. The reason of this is, that\r\nat the end of such a cycle, the moon is in nearly the same position\r\nwith respect to the sun, her nodes, and her apogee, as she was at\r\nfirst; and is only a few degrees distant from the same part of the\r\nheavens. But on the strength of this consideration, Halley\r\nconjectured that all the irregularities of the moon's motion,\r\nhowever complex they may be, would recur after such an interval; and\r\nthat, therefore, if the requisite corrections were determined by\r\nobservation for one such period, we might by means of them give\r\naccuracy to the Tables for all succeeding periods. This idea\r\noccurred to him before he was acquainted with Newton's views.[70\\7]\r\nAfter the lunar theory of the _Principia_ had appeared, he could not\r\nhelp seeing that the idea was confirmed; for the inequalities of the\r\nmoon's motion, which arise from the attraction of the sun, will\r\ndepend on her positions with regard to the sun, the apogee, and the\r\nnode; and therefore, however numerous, will recur when these\r\npositions recur.\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\7: _Phil. Trans._ 1731, p. 188.]\r\n\r\nHalley announced, in 1691,[71\\7] his intention of following this\r\nidea into practice; in a paper in which he corrected the text of\r\nthree passages in Pliny, in which this period is mentioned, and from\r\nwhich it is sometimes called the Plinian period. In 1710, in the\r\npreface to a new edition to Street's _Caroline Tables_, he stated\r\nthat he had already confirmed it to a considerable extent.[72\\7] And\r\neven after Newton's theory had been applied, he still resolved to\r\nuse his cycle as a means of obtaining further accuracy. On\r\nsucceeding to the Observatory at Greenwich in 1720, he was further\r\ndelayed by finding that the instruments had belonged to Flamsteed,\r\nand were removed by his executors. \"And this,\" he says,[73\\7] \"was\r\nthe more grievous to me, on account of my advanced age, being then\r\nin my sixty-fourth year: which put me past all hopes of ever living\r\nto see a complete period of eighteen years' observation. But, thanks\r\nto God, he has been pleased hitherto (in 1731) to afford me\r\nsufficient health and strength to execute my office, in all its\r\nparts, with my own hands and eyes, without any assistance or\r\ninterruption, during one whole period of the moon's {437} apogee,\r\nwhich period is performed in somewhat less than nine years.\" He\r\nfound the agreement very remarkable, and conceived hopes of\r\nattaining the great object, of finding the Longitude with the\r\nrequisite degree of exactness; nor did he give up his labors on this\r\nsubject till he had completed his Plinian period in 1739.\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\7: Ib. p. 536.]\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\7: Ib. 1731, p. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\7: Ib. p. 193.]\r\n\r\nThe accuracy with which Halley conceived himself able to predict the\r\nmoon's place[74\\7] was within two minutes of space, or one fifteenth\r\nof the breadth of the moon herself. The accuracy required for\r\nobtaining the national reward was considerably greater. Le Monnier\r\npursued the idea of Halley.[75\\7] But before Halley's method had\r\nbeen completed, it was superseded by the more direct prosecution of\r\nNewton's views.\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\7: _Phil. Trans._ 1731, p. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\7: Bailly, _A. M._ c. 131.]\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked, in the history of analytical mechanics, that\r\nin the Lunar Theory, considered as one of the cases of the Problem of\r\nThree Bodies, no advance was made beyond what Newton had done, till\r\nmathematicians threw aside the Newtonian artifices, and applied the\r\nnewly developed generalizations of the analytical method. The first\r\ngreat apparent deficiency in the agreement of the law of universal\r\ngravitation with astronomical observation, was removed by Clairaut's\r\nimproved approximation to the theoretical Motion of the Moon's Apogee,\r\nin 1750; yet not till it had caused so much disquietude, that Clairaut\r\nhimself had suggested a modification of the law of attraction; and it\r\nwas only in tracing the consequences of this suggestion, that he found\r\nthe Newtonian law of the inverse square to be that which, when rightly\r\ndeveloped, agreed with the facts. Euler solved the problem by the aid\r\nof his analysis in 1745,[76\\7] and published Tables of the Moon in\r\n1746. His tables were not very accurate at first;[77\\7] but he,\r\nD'Alembert, and Clairaut, continued to labor at this object, and the\r\ntwo latter published Tables of the Moon in 1754.[78\\7] Finally, Tobias\r\nMayer, an astronomer of Göttingen, having compared Euler's tables with\r\nobservations, corrected them so successfully, that in 1753 he\r\npublished Tables of the Moon, which really did possess the accuracy\r\nwhich Halley only flattered himself that he had attained. Mayer's\r\nsuccess in his first Tables encouraged him to make them still more\r\nperfect. He applied himself to the mechanical theory of the moon's\r\norbit; corrected all the coefficients of the series by a great number\r\nof observations; and in 1755, sent his new Tables to London as worthy\r\nto claim the prize offered for the discovery of longitude. He died\r\nsoon after {438} (in 1762), at the early age of thirty-nine, worn out\r\nby his incessant labors; and his widow sent to London a copy of his\r\nTables with additional corrections. These Tables were committed to\r\nBradley, then Astronomer Royal, in order to be compared with\r\nobservation. Bradley labored at this task with unremitting zeal and\r\nindustry, having himself long entertained hopes that the Lunar Method\r\nof finding the Longitude might be brought into general use. He and his\r\nassistant, Gael Morris, introduced corrections into Mayer's Tables of\r\n1755. In his report of 1756, he says,[79\\7] that he did not find any\r\ndifference so great as a minute and a quarter; and in 1760, he adds,\r\nthat this deviation had been further diminished by his corrections. It\r\nis not foreign to our purpose to observe the great labor which this\r\nverification required. Not less than 1220 observations, and long\r\ncalculations founded upon each, were employed. The accuracy which\r\nMayer's Tables possessed was considered to entitle them to a part of\r\nthe parliamentary reward; they were printed in 1770, and his widow\r\nreceived 3000_l._ from the English nation. At the same time, Euler,\r\nwhose Tables had been the origin and foundation of Mayer's, also had a\r\nrecompense of the same amount.\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\7: Lal. 1460.]\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\7: Bradley's Correspondence.]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\7: Lal. 1460.]\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\7: Bradley's _Mem._ p. xcviii.]\r\n\r\nThis public national acknowledgment of the practical accuracy of\r\nthese Tables is, it will be observed, also a solemn recognition of\r\nthe truth of the Newtonian theory, as far as truth can be judged of\r\nby men acting under the highest official responsibility, and aided\r\nby the most complete command of the resources of the skill and\r\ntalents of others. The finding the Longitude is thus the seal of the\r\nmoon's gravitation to the sun and earth; and with this occurrence,\r\ntherefore, our main concern with the history of the Lunar Theory\r\nends. Various improvements have been since introduced into this\r\nresearch; but on these we, with so many other subjects before us,\r\nmust forbear to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to the Planets,\r\nSatellites, and Earth._\r\n\r\nTHE theories of the Planets and Satellites, as affected by the law\r\nof universal gravitation, and therefore by perturbations, were\r\nnaturally subjects of interest, after the promulgation of that law.\r\nSome of the effects of the mutual attraction of the planets had,\r\nindeed, already attracted notice. The inequality produced by the\r\nmutual attraction of Jupiter and Saturn cannot be overlooked by a\r\ngood observer. In the {439} preface to the second edition of the\r\n_Principia_, Cotes remarks,[80\\7] that the perturbation of Jupiter\r\nand Saturn is not unknown to astronomers. In Halley's Tables it was\r\nnoticed[81\\7] that there are very great deviations from regularity\r\nin these two planets, and these deviations are ascribed to the\r\nperturbing force of the planets on each other; but the correction of\r\nthese by a suitable equation is left to succeeding astronomers.\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\7: Preface to _Principia_, p. xxi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\7: End of Planetary Tables.]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the planes and apsides of the planetary orbits was one\r\nof the first results of their mutual perturbation which was\r\nobserved. In 1706, La Hire and Maraldi compared Jupiter with the\r\nRudolphine Tables, and those of Bullialdus: it appeared that his\r\naphelion had advanced, and that his nodes had regressed. In 1728, J.\r\nCassini found that Saturn's aphelion had in like manner travelled\r\nforwards. In 1720, when Louville refused to allow in his solar\r\ntables the motion of the aphelion of the earth, Fontenelle observed\r\nthat this was a misplaced scrupulousness, since the aphelion of\r\nMercury certainly advances. Yet this reluctance to admit change and\r\nirregularity was not yet overcome. When astronomers had found an\r\napproximate and apparent constancy and regularity, they were willing\r\nto believe it absolute and exact. In the satellites of Jupiter, for\r\ninstance, they were unwilling to admit even the eccentricity of the\r\norbits; and still more, the variation of the nodes, inclinations,\r\nand apsides. But all the fixedness of these was successively\r\ndisproved. Fontenelle in 1732, on the occasion of Maraldi's\r\ndiscovery of the change of inclination of the fourth satellite,\r\nexpresses a suspicion that all the elements might prove liable to\r\nchange. \"We see,\" says he, \"the constancy of the inclination already\r\nshaken in the three first satellites, and the eccentricity in the\r\nfourth. The immobility of the nodes holds out so far, but there are\r\nstrong indications that it will share the same fate.\"\r\n\r\nThe motions of the nodes and apsides of the satellites are a\r\nnecessary part of the Newtonian theory; and even the Cartesian\r\nastronomers now required only data, in order to introduce these\r\nchanges into their Tables.\r\n\r\nThe complete reformation of the Tables of the Sun, Planets, and\r\nSatellites, which followed as a natural consequence from the\r\nrevolution which Newton had introduced, was rendered possible by the\r\nlabors of the great constellation of mathematicians of whom we have\r\nspoken in the last book, Clairaut, Euler, D'Alembert, and their\r\nsuccessors; and {440} it was carried into effect in the course of\r\nthe last century. Thus Lalande applied Clairaut's theory to Mars, as\r\ndid Mayer; and the inequalities in this case, says Bailly[82\\7] in\r\n1785, may amount to two minutes, and therefore must not be\r\nneglected. Lalande determined the inequalities of Venus, as did\r\nFather Walmesley, an English mathematician; these were found to\r\nreach only to thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\7: _Ast. Mod._ iii. 170.]\r\n\r\nThe Planetary Tables[83\\7] which were in highest repute, up to the\r\nend of the last century, were those of Lalande. In these, the\r\nperturbations of Jupiter and Saturn were introduced, their magnitude\r\nbeing such that they cannot be dispensed with; but the Tables of\r\nMercury, Venus, and Mars, had no perturbations. Hence these latter\r\nTables might be considered as accurate enough to enable the observer\r\nto find the object, but not to test the theory of perturbations. But\r\nwhen the calculation of the mutual disturbances of the planets was\r\napplied, it was always found that it enabled mathematicians to bring\r\nthe theoretical places to coincide more exactly with those observed.\r\nIn improving, as much as possible, this coincidence, it is necessary\r\nto determine the mass of each planet; for upon that, according to\r\nthe law of universal gravitation, its disturbing power depends.\r\nThus, in 1813, Lindenau published Tables of Mercury, and concluded,\r\nfrom them, that a considerable increase of the supposed mass of\r\nVenus was necessary to reconcile theory with observation.[84\\7] He\r\nhad published Tables of Venus in 1810, and of Mars in 1811. And, in\r\nproving Bouvard's Tables of Jupiter and Saturn, values were obtained\r\nof the masses of those planets. The form in which the question of\r\nthe truth of the doctrine of universal gravitation now offers itself\r\nto the minds of astronomers, is this:--that it is taken for granted\r\nthat it will account for the motions of the heavenly bodies, and the\r\nquestion is, with what supposed masses it will give the _best_\r\naccount.[85\\7] The continually increasing accuracy of the table\r\nshows the truth of the fundamental assumption.\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\7: Airy, _Report on Ast. to Brit. Ass._ 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\7: Airy, _Report on Ast. to Brit. **Ass._ 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\7: Among the most important corrections of the supposed\r\nmasses of the planets, we may notice that of Jupiter, by Professor\r\nAiry.  This determination of Jupiter's mass was founded, not on the\r\neffect as seen in perturbations, but on a much more direct datum,\r\nthe time of revolution of his fourth satellite. It appeared, from\r\nthis calculation, that Jupiter's mass required to be increased by\r\nabout 1⁄80th. This result agrees with that which has been derived by\r\nGerman astronomers from the perturbations which the attractions of\r\nJupiter produce in the four new planets, and has been generally\r\nadopted as an improvement of the elements of our system.]\r\n\r\nThe question of perturbation is exemplified in the satellites also.\r\n{441} Thus the satellites of Jupiter are not only disturbed by the\r\nsun, as the moon is, but also by each other, as the planets are.\r\nThis mutual action gives rise to some very curious relations among\r\ntheir motions; which, like most of the other leading inequalities,\r\nwere forced upon the notice of astronomers by observation before\r\nthey were obtained by mathematical calculation. In Bradley's remarks\r\nupon his own Tables of Jupiter's Satellites, published among\r\nHalley's Tables, he observes that the places of the three interior\r\nsatellites are affected by errors which recur in a cycle of 437\r\ndays, answering to the time in which they return to the same\r\nrelative position with regard to each other, and to the axis of\r\nJupiter's shadow. Wargentin, who had noticed the same circumstance\r\nwithout knowledge of what Bradley had done, applied it, with all\r\ndiligence, to the purpose of improving the tables of the satellites\r\nin 1746. But, at a later period, Laplace established, by\r\nmathematical reasoning, the very curious theorem on which this cycle\r\ndepends, which he calls the _libration of Jupiter's satellites_; and\r\nDelambre was then able to publish Tables of Jupiter's Satellites\r\nmore accurate than those of Wargentin, which he did in 1789.[86\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\7: Voiron, _Hist. Ast._ p. 322.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of physical astronomy from the time of Euler and\r\nClairaut, has consisted of a series of calculations and comparisons\r\nof the most abstruse and recondite kind. The formation of Tables of\r\nthe Planets and Satellites from the theory, required the solution of\r\nproblems much more complex than the original case of the Problem of\r\nThree Bodies. The real motions of the planets and their orbits are\r\nrendered still further intricate by this, that all the lines and\r\npoints to which we can refer them, are themselves in motion. The\r\ntask of carrying order and law into this mass of apparent confusion,\r\nhas required a long series of men of transcendent intellectual\r\npowers; and a perseverance and delicacy of observation, such as we\r\nhave not the smallest example of in any other subject. It is\r\nimpossible here to give any detailed account of these labors; but we\r\nmay mention one instance of the complex considerations which enter\r\ninto them. The nodes of Jupiter's fourth satellite do not go\r\nbackwards,[87\\7] as the Newtonian theory seems to require; they\r\nadvance upon Jupiter's orbit. But then, it is to be recollected that\r\nthe theory requires the nodes to retrograde upon the orbit of the\r\nperturbing body, which is here the third satellite; and Lalande\r\nshowed that, by the necessary relations of space, the latter motion\r\nmay be retrograde though the former is direct. {442}\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\7: Bailly, iii. 175.]\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made, from the time of the solution of the\r\nProblem of three bodies to the present, to give the greatest\r\npossible accuracy to the Tables of the Sun, by considering the\r\neffect of the various perturbations to which the earth is subject.\r\nThus, in 1756, Euler calculated the effect of the attractions of the\r\nplanets on the earth (the prize-question of the French Academy of\r\nSciences), and Clairaut soon after. Lacaille, making use of these\r\nresults, and of his own numerous observations, published Tables of\r\nthe Sun. In 1786, Delambre[88\\7] undertook to verify and improve\r\nthese tables, by comparing them with 314 observations made by\r\nMaskelyne, at Greenwich, in 1775 and 1784, and in some of the\r\nintermediate years. He corrected most of the elements; but he could\r\nnot remove the uncertainty which occurred respecting the amount of\r\nthe inequality produced by the reaction of the moon. He admitted\r\nalso, in pursuance of Clairaut's theory, a second term of this\r\ninequality depending on the moon's latitude; but irresolutely, and\r\nhalf disposed to reject it on the authority of the observations.\r\nSucceeding researches of mathematicians have shown, that this term\r\nis not admissible as a result of mechanical principles. Delambre's\r\nTables, thus improved, were exact to seven or eight seconds;[89\\7]\r\nwhich was thought, and truly, a very close coincidence for the time.\r\nBut astronomers were far from resting content with this. In 1806,\r\nthe French Board of Longitude published Delambre's improved Solar\r\nTables; and in the _Connaissance des Tems_ for 1816, Burckhardt gave\r\nthe results of a comparison of Delambre's Tables with a great number\r\nof Maskelyne's observations;--far greater than the number on which\r\nthey were founded.[90\\7] It appeared that the epoch, the perigee,\r\nand the eccentricity, required sensible alterations, and that the\r\nmass of Venus ought to be reduced about one-ninth, and that of the\r\nMoon to be sensibly diminished. In 1827, Professor Airy[91\\7]\r\ncompared Delambre's tables with 2000 Greenwich observations, made\r\nwith the new transit-instrument at Cambridge, and deduced from this\r\ncomparison the correction of the elements. These in general agreed\r\nclosely with Burckhardt's, excepting that a diminution of Mars\r\nappeared necessary. Some discordances, however, led Professor Airy\r\nto suspect the existence of an inequality which had escaped the\r\nsagacity of Laplace and Burckhardt. And, a few weeks after this\r\nsuspicion had been expressed, the same mathematician announced to\r\nthe Royal Society that he had {443} detected, in the planetary\r\ntheory such an inequality, hitherto unnoticed, arising from the\r\nmutual attraction of Venus and the Earth. Its whole effect on the\r\nearth's longitude, would be to increase or diminish it by nearly\r\nthree seconds of space, and its period is about 240 years. \"This\r\nterm,\" he adds, \"accounts completely for the difference of the\r\nsecular motions given by the comparison of the epochs of 1783 and\r\n1821, and by that of the epochs of 1801 and 1821.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\7: Voiron, _Hist._ p. 315.]\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\7: Montucla, iv. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\7: Airy, _Report_, p. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\7: _Phil. Trans._ 1828.]\r\n\r\nMany excellent Tables of the motions of the sun, moon, and planets,\r\nwere published in the latter part of the last century; but the\r\nBureau des Longitudes which was established in France in 1795,\r\nendeavored to give new or improved tables of most of these motions.\r\nThus were produced Delambre's Tables of the Sun, Burg's Tables of\r\nthe Moon, Bouvard's Tables of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. The\r\nagreement between these and observation is, in general, truly\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\nWe may notice here a difference in the mode of referring to\r\nobservation when a theory is first established, and when it is\r\nafterwards to be confirmed and corrected. It was remarked as a merit\r\nin the method of Hipparchus, and an evidence of the mathematical\r\ncoherence of his theory, that in order to determine the place of the\r\nsun's apogee, and the eccentricity of his orbit, he required to know\r\nnothing besides the lengths of winter and spring. But if the fewness\r\nof the requisite data is a beauty in the first fixation of a theory,\r\nthe multitude of observations to which it applies is its excellence\r\nwhen it is established; and in correcting Tables, mathematicians\r\ntake far more data than would be requisite to determine the\r\nelements. For the theory ought to account for _all_ the facts: and\r\nsince it will not do this with mathematical rigor (for observation\r\nis not perfect), the elements are determined, not so as to satisfy\r\nany selected observations, but so as to make the whole mass of error\r\nas small as possible. And thus, in the adaptation of theory to\r\nobservation, even in its most advanced state, there is room for\r\nsagacity and skill, prudence and judgment.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, by selecting the best mean elements of the motions\r\nof the heavenly bodies, the observed motions deviate from this mean\r\nin the way the theory points out, and constantly return to it. To\r\nthis general rule, of the constant return to a mean, there are,\r\nhowever, some apparent exceptions, of which we shall now speak. {444}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to Secular\r\nInequalities._\r\n\r\nSECULAR Inequalities in the motions of the heavenly bodies occur in\r\nconsequence of changes in the elements of the solar system, which go\r\non progressively from age to age. The example of such changes which\r\nwas first studied by astronomers, was the Acceleration of the Moon's\r\nMean Motion, discovered by Halley. The observed fact was, that the\r\nmoon now moves in a very small degree quicker than she did in the\r\nearlier ages of the world. When this was ascertained, the various\r\nhypotheses which appeared likely to account for the fact were\r\nreduced to calculation. The resistance of the medium in which the\r\nheavenly bodies move was the most obvious of these hypotheses.\r\nAnother, which was for some time dwelt upon by Laplace, was the\r\nsuccessive transmission of gravity, that is, the hypothesis that the\r\ngravity of the earth takes a certain finite time to reach the moon.\r\nBut none of these suppositions gave satisfactory conclusions; and\r\nthe strength of Euler, D'Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace, was for a\r\ntime foiled by this difficulty. At length, in 1787, Laplace\r\nannounced to the Academy that he had discovered the true cause of\r\nthis acceleration, and that it arose from the action of the sun upon\r\nthe moon, combined with the secular variation of the eccentricity of\r\nthe earth's orbit. It was found that the effects of this combination\r\nwould exactly account for the changes which had hitherto so\r\nperplexed mathematicians. A very remarkable result of this\r\ninvestigation was, that \"this Secular Inequality of the motion of\r\nthe moon is periodical, but it requires millions of years to\r\nre-establish itself;\" so that after an almost inconceivable time,\r\nthe acceleration will become a retardation. Laplace some time after\r\n(in 1797), announced other discoveries, relative to the secular\r\nmotions of the apogee and the nodes of the moon's orbit. Laplace\r\ncollected these researches in his \"Theory of the Moon,\" which he\r\npublished in the third volume of the _Mécanique Céleste_ in 1802.\r\n\r\nA similar case occurred with regard to an acceleration of Jupiter's\r\nmean motion, and a retardation of Saturn's, which had been observed\r\nby Cassini, Maraldi, and Horrox. After several imperfect attempts by\r\nother mathematicians, Laplace, in 1787, found that there resulted\r\nfrom the mutual attraction of these two planets a great Inequality,\r\nof which the period is 929 years and a half, and which has\r\naccelerated Jupiter and retarded Saturn ever since the restoration\r\nof astronomy. {445}\r\n\r\nThus the secular inequalities of the celestial motions, like all the\r\nothers, confirm the law of universal gravitation. They are called\r\n\"secular,\" because ages are requisite to unfold their existence, and\r\nbecause they are not obviously periodical. They might, in some\r\nmeasure, be considered as extensions of the Newtonian theory, for\r\nthough Newton's law accounts for such facts, he did not, so far as\r\nwe know, foresee such a result of it. But on the other hand, they\r\nare exactly of the same nature as those which he did foresee and\r\ncalculate. And when we call them _secular_ in opposition to\r\n_periodical_, it is not that there is any real difference, for they,\r\ntoo, have their cycle; but it is that we have assumed our _mean_\r\nmotion without allowing for these long inequalities. And thus, as\r\nLaplace observes on this very occasion,[92\\7] the lot of this great\r\ndiscovery of gravitation is no less than this, that every apparent\r\nexception becomes a proof, every difficulty a new occasion of a\r\ntriumph. And such, as he truly adds, is the character of a true\r\ntheory,--of a real representation of nature.\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\7: _Syst. du Monde_, 8vo, ii. 37.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us here to enumerate even the principal objects\r\nwhich have thus filled the triumphal march of the Newtonian theory\r\nfrom its outset up to the present time. But among these secular\r\nchanges, we may mention the Diminution of the Obliquity of the\r\nEcliptic, which has been going on from the earliest times to the\r\npresent. This change has been explained by theory, and shown to\r\nhave, like all the other changes of the system, a limit, after which\r\nthe diminution will be converted into an increase.\r\n\r\nWe may mention here some subjects of a kind somewhat different from\r\nthose just spoken of. The true theoretical quantity of the\r\nPrecession of the Equinoxes, which had been erroneously calculated\r\nby Newton, was shown by D'Alembert to agree with observation. The\r\nconstant coincidence of the Nodes of the Moon's Equator with those\r\nof her Orbit, was proved to result from mechanical principles by\r\nLagrange. The curious circumstance that the Time of the Moon's\r\nrotation on her axis is equal to the Time of her revolution about\r\nthe earth, was shown to be consistent with the results of the laws\r\nof motion by Laplace. Laplace also, as we have seen, explained\r\ncertain remarkable relations which constantly connect the longitudes\r\nof the three first satellites of Jupiter; Bailly and Lagrange\r\nanalyzed and explained the curious librations of the nodes and\r\ninclinations of their orbits; and Laplace traced the effect of\r\nJupiter's oblate figure on their motions, {446} which masks the\r\nother causes of inequality, by determining the direction of the\r\nmotions of the _perijove_ and node of each satellite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to the New\r\nPlanets._\r\n\r\nWE are now so accustomed to consider the Newtonian theory as true,\r\nthat we can hardly imagine to ourselves the possibility that those\r\nplanets which were not discovered when the theory was founded,\r\nshould contradict its doctrines. We can scarcely conceive it\r\npossible that Uranus or Ceres should have been found to violate\r\nKepler's laws, or to move without suffering perturbations from\r\nJupiter and Saturn. Yet if we can suppose men to have had any doubt\r\nof the exact and universal truth of the doctrine of universal\r\ngravitation, at the period of these discoveries, they must have\r\nscrutinized the motions of these new bodies with an interest far\r\nmore lively than that with which we now look for the predicted\r\nreturn of a comet. The solid establishment of the Newtonian theory\r\nis thus shown by the manner in which we take it for granted not only\r\nin our reasonings, but in our feelings. But though this is so, a\r\nshort notice of the process by which the new planets were brought\r\nwithin the domain of the theory may properly find a place here.\r\n\r\nWilliam Herschel, a man of great energy and ingenuity, who had made\r\nmaterial improvements in reflecting telescopes, observing at Bath on\r\nthe 13th of March, 1781, discovered, in the constellation Gemini, a\r\nstar larger and less luminous than the fixed stars. On the\r\napplication of a more powerful telescope, it was seen magnified, and\r\ntwo days afterwards he perceived that it had changed its place. The\r\nattention of the astronomical world was directed to this new object,\r\nand the best astronomers in every part of Europe employed themselves\r\nin following it along the sky.[93\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\7: Voiron, _Hist. Ast._ p. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe admission of an eighth planet into the long-established list, was\r\na notion so foreign to men's thoughts at that time, that other\r\nsuppositions were first tried. The orbit of the new body was at first\r\ncalculated as if it had been a comet running in a parabolic path. But\r\nin a few days the star deviated from the course thus assigned it: and\r\nit was in vain that in order to represent the observations, the\r\nperihelion distance of the parabola was increased from fourteen to\r\neighteen times the earth's distance from the sun. Saron, of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Paris, is said[94\\7] to have been the first\r\nperson who perceived that the {447} places were better represented by\r\na circle than by a parabola: and Lexell, a celebrated mathematician of\r\nPetersburg, found that a motion in a circular orbit, with a radius\r\ndouble of that of Saturn, would satisfy all the observations. This\r\nmade its period about eighty-two years.\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\7: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nLalande soon discovered that the circular motion was subject to a\r\nsensible inequality: the orbit was, in fact, an ellipse, like those\r\nof the other planets. To determine the equation of the centre of a\r\nbody which revolves so slowly, would, according to the ancient\r\nmethods, have required many years; but Laplace contrived methods by\r\nwhich the elliptical elements were determined from four\r\nobservations, within little more than a year from its first\r\ndiscovery by Herschel. These calculations were soon followed by\r\ntables of the new planet, published by Nouet.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain additional accuracy, it now became necessary to\r\ntake account of the perturbations. The French Academy of Sciences\r\nproposed, in 1789, the construction of new Tables of this Planet as\r\nits prize-question. It is a curious illustration of the constantly\r\naccumulating evidence of the theory, that the calculation of the\r\nperturbations of the planet enabled astronomers to discover that it\r\nhad been observed as a star in three different positions in former\r\ntimes; namely, by Flamsteed in 1690, by Mayer in 1756, and by Le\r\nMonnier in 1769. Delambre, aided by this discovery and by the theory\r\nof Laplace, calculated Tables of the planet, which, being compared\r\nwith observation for three years, never deviated from it more than\r\nseven seconds. The Academy awarded its prize to these Tables, they\r\nwere adopted by the astronomers of Europe, and the planet of Herschel\r\nnow conforms to the laws of attraction, along with those ancient\r\nmembers of the known system from which the theory was inferred.\r\n\r\nThe history of the discovery of the other new planets, Ceres,\r\nPallas, Juno, and Vesta, is nearly similar to that just related,\r\nexcept that their planetary character was more readily believed. The\r\nfirst of these was discovered on the first day of this century by\r\nPiazzi, the astronomer at Palermo; but he had only begun to suspect\r\nits nature, and had not completed his third observation, when his\r\nlabors were suspended by a dangerous illness; and on his recovery\r\nthe star was invisible, being lost in the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nHe declared it to be a planet with an elliptical orbit; but the path\r\nwhich it followed, on emerging from the neighborhood of the sun, was\r\nnot that which Piazzi had traced out for it. Its extreme smallness\r\nmade it difficult to rediscover; and the whole of the year 1801 was\r\n{448} employed in searching the sky for it in vain. At last, after\r\nmany trials, Von Zach and Olbers again found it, the one on the last\r\nday of 1801, the other on the first day of 1802. Gauss and Burckhardt\r\nimmediately used the new observations in determining the elements of\r\nthe orbit; and the former invented a new method for the purpose. Ceres\r\nnow moves in a path of which the course and inequalities are known,\r\nand can no more escape the scrutiny of astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe second year of the nineteenth century also produced its planet.\r\nThis was discovered by Dr. Olbers, a physician of Bremen, while he\r\nwas searching for Ceres among the stars of the constellation Virgo.\r\nHe found a star which had a perceptible motion even in the space of\r\ntwo hours. It was soon announced as a new planet, and received from\r\nits discoverer the name of Pallas. As in the case of Ceres,\r\nBurckhardt and Gauss employed themselves in calculating its orbit.\r\nBut some peculiar difficulties here occurred. Its eccentricity is\r\ngreater than that of any of the old planets, and the inclination of\r\nits orbit to the ecliptic is not less than thirty-five degrees.\r\nThese circumstances both made its perturbations large, and rendered\r\nthem difficult to calculate. Burckhardt employed the known processes\r\nof analysis, but they were found insufficient: and the Imperial\r\nInstitute (as the French Academy was termed during the reign of\r\nNapoleon) proposed the Perturbations of Pallas as a prize-question.\r\n\r\nTo these discoveries succeeded others of the same kind. The German\r\nastronomers agreed to examine the whole of the zone in which Ceres\r\nand Pallas move; in the hope of finding other planets, fragments, as\r\nOlbers conceived they might possibly be, of one original mass. In\r\nthe course of this research, Mr. Harding of Lilienthal, on the first\r\nof September, 1804, found a new star, which he soon was led to\r\nconsider as a planet. Gauss and Burckhardt also calculated the\r\nelements of this orbit, and the planet was named Juno.\r\n\r\nAfter this discovery, Olbers sought the sky for additional fragments\r\nof his planet with extraordinary perseverance. He conceived that one\r\nof two opposite constellations, the Virgin or the Whale, was the\r\nplace where its separation must have taken place; and where,\r\ntherefore, all the orbits of all the portions must pass. He resolved\r\nto survey, three times a year, all the small stars in these two\r\nregions. This undertaking, so curious in its nature, was successful.\r\nThe 29th of March, 1807, he discovered Vesta, which was soon found\r\nto be a planet. And to show the manner in which Olbers pursued his\r\nlabors, we may state that he afterwards published a notification\r\nthat he had examined the {449} same parts of the heavens with such\r\nregularity, that he was certain no new planet had passed that way\r\nbetween 1808 and 1816. Gauss and Burckhardt computed the orbit of\r\nVesta; and when Gauss compared one of his orbits with twenty-two\r\nobservations of M. Bouvard, he found the errors below seventeen\r\nseconds of space in right ascension, and still less in declination.\r\n\r\nThe elements of all these orbits have been successively improved,\r\nand this has been done entirely by the German mathematicians.[95\\7]\r\nThese perturbations are calculated, and the places for some time\r\nbefore and after opposition are now given in the Berlin Ephemeris.\r\n\"I have lately observed,\" says Professor Airy, \"and compared with\r\nthe Berlin Ephemeris, the right ascensions of Juno and Vesta, and I\r\nfind that they are rather more accurate than those of Venus:\" so\r\ncomplete is the confirmation of the theory by these new bodies; so\r\nexact are the methods of tracing the theory to its consequences.\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\7: Airy, _Rep._ 157.]\r\n\r\nWe may observe that all these new-discovered bodies have received\r\nnames taken from the ancient mythology. In the case of the first of\r\nthese, astronomers were originally divided; the discoverer himself\r\nnamed it the _Georgium Sidus_, in honor of his patron, George the\r\nThird; Lalande and others called it _Herschel_. Nothing can be more\r\njust than this mode of perpetuating the fame of the author of a\r\ndiscovery; but it was felt to be ungraceful to violate the\r\nhomogeneity of the ancient system of names. Astronomers tried to\r\nfind for the hitherto neglected denizen of the skies, an appropriate\r\nplace among the deities to whose assembly he was at last admitted;\r\nand _Uranus_, the father of Saturn, was fixed upon as best suiting\r\nthe order of the course.\r\n\r\nThe mythological nomenclature of planets appeared, from this time,\r\nto be generally agreed to. Piazzi termed his _Ceres Ferdinandea_.\r\nThe first term, which contains a happy allusion to Sicily, the\r\ncountry of the discovery in modern, and of the goddess in ancient,\r\ntimes, has been accepted; the attempt to pay a compliment to royalty\r\nout of the products of science, in this as in most other cases, has\r\nbeen set aside. Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, were named, without any\r\npeculiar propriety of selection, according to the choice of their\r\ndiscoverers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to Comets._\r\n\r\nA FEW words must be said upon another class of bodies, which at\r\nfirst seemed as lawless as the clouds and winds; and which astronomy\r\n{450} has reduced to a regularity as complete as that of the\r\nsun;--upon _Comets_. No part of the Newtonian discoveries excited a\r\nmore intense interest than this. These anomalous visitants were\r\nanciently gazed at with wonder and alarm; and might still, as in\r\nformer times, be accused of \"perplexing nations,\" though with very\r\ndifferent fears and questionings. The conjecture that they, too,\r\nobeyed the law of universal gravitation, was to be verified by\r\nshowing that they described a curve such as that force would\r\nproduce. Hevelius, who was a most diligent observer of these\r\nobjects, had, without reference to gravitation, satisfied himself\r\nthat they moved in parabolas.[96\\7] To determine the elements of the\r\nparabola from observations, even Newton called[97\\7] \"problema longe\r\ndifficillimum.\" Newton determined the orbit of the comet of 1680 by\r\ncertain graphical methods. His methods supposed the orbit to be a\r\nparabola, and satisfactorily represented the motion in the visible\r\npart of the comet's path. But this method did not apply to the\r\npossible return of the wandering star. Halley has the glory of\r\nhaving first detected a periodical comet, in the case of that which\r\nhas since borne his name. But this great discovery was not made\r\nwithout labor. In 1705, Halley[98\\7] explained how the parabolic\r\norbit of a planet may be determined from three observations; and,\r\njoining example to precept, himself calculated the positions and\r\norbits of twenty-four comets. He found, as the reward of this\r\nindustry, that the comets of 1607 and of 1531 had the same orbit as\r\nthat of 1682. And here the intervals are also nearly the same,\r\nnamely, about seventy-five years. Are the three comets then\r\nidentical? In looking back into the history of such appearances, he\r\nfound comets recorded in 1456, in 1380, and in 1305; the intervals\r\nare still the same, seventy-five or seventy-six years. It was\r\nimpossible now to doubt that they were the periods of a revolving\r\nbody; that the comet was a planet; its orbit a long ellipse, not a\r\nparabola.[99\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\7: Bailly, ii. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\7: _Principia_, ed. 1. p. 494.]\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\7: Bailly, ii. 646.]\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\7: The importance of Halley's labors on Comets has always\r\nbeen acknowledged. In speaking of Halley's _Synopsis Astronomicæ\r\nCometicæ_, Delambre says (_Ast._ xviii. _Siècle_, p. 130), \"Voilà\r\nbien, depuis Kepler, ce qu'on a fait de plus grand, de plus beau, de\r\nplus neuf en astronomie.\" Halley, in predicting the comet of 1758,\r\nsays, if it returns, \"Hoc primum ab homine Anglo iuventum fuisse non\r\ninficiabitur æqua posteritas.\"]\r\n\r\nBut if this were so, the Comet must reappear in 1758 or 1759. Halley\r\npredicted that it would do so; and the fulfilment of this prediction\r\nwas naturally looked forwards to, as an additional stamp of the\r\ntruths of the theory of gravitation. {451}\r\n\r\nBut in all this, the Comet had been supposed to be affected only by\r\nthe attraction of the sun. The planets must disturb its motion as\r\nthey disturb each other. How would this disturbance affect the time\r\nand circumstances of its reappearance? Halley had proposed, but not\r\nattempted to solve, this question.\r\n\r\nThe effect of perturbations upon a comet defeats all known methods\r\nof approximation, and requires immense labor. \"Clairaut,\" says\r\nBailly,[100\\7] \"undertook this: with courage enough to dare the\r\nadventure, he had talent enough to obtain a memorable victory;\" the\r\ndifficulties, the labors, grew upon him as he advanced, but he\r\nfought his way through them, assisted by Lalande, and by a female\r\ncalculator, Madame Lepaute. He predicted that the comet would reach\r\nits perihelion April 13, 1759, but claimed the license of a month\r\nfor the inevitable inaccuracy of a calculation which, in addition to\r\nall other sources of error, was made in haste, that it might appear\r\nas a prediction. The comet justified his calculations and his caution\r\ntogether; for it arrived at its perihelion on the 13th of March.\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\7: Bailly, _A. M._ iii. 190.]\r\n\r\nTwo other Comets, of much shorter period, have been detected of late\r\nyears; Encke's, which revolves round the sun in three years and\r\none-third, and Biela's which describes an ellipse, not extremely\r\neccentric, in six years and three-quarters. These bodies, apparently\r\nthin and vaporous masses, like other comets, have, since their\r\norbits were calculated, punctually conformed to the law of\r\ngravitation. If it were still doubtful whether the more conspicuous\r\ncomets do so, these bodies would tend to prove the fact, by showing\r\nit to be true in an intermediate case.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [A third Comet of short period was discovered by Faye, at the\r\nObservatory of Paris, Nov. 22, 1843. It is included between the orbits\r\nof Mars and Saturn, and its period is seven years and three-tenths.\r\n\r\nThis is commonly called _Faye's Comet_, as the two mentioned in the\r\ntext are called _Encke's_ and _Biela's_. In the former edition I had\r\nexpressed my assent to the rule proposed by M. Arago, that the latter\r\nought to be called _Gambart's Comet_, in honor of the astronomer who\r\nfirst proved it to revolve round the Sun. But astronomers in general\r\nhave used the former name, considering that the discovery and\r\nobservation of the object are more distinct and conspicuous merits\r\nthan a calculation founded upon the observations of others. And in\r\nreality {452} Biela had great merit in the discovery of his Comet's\r\nperiodicity, having set about his search of it from an anticipation of\r\nits return founded upon former observations.\r\n\r\nAlso a Comet was discovered by De Vico at Rome on Aug. 22, 1844,\r\nwhich was found to describe an elliptical orbit having its aphelion\r\nnear the orbit of Jupiter, which is consequently one of those of\r\nshort period. And on Feb. 26, 1846, M. Brorsen of Kiel discovered a\r\ntelescopic Comet whose orbit is found to be elliptical.]\r\n\r\nWe may add to the history of Comets, that of Lexell's, which, in\r\n1770, appeared to be revolving in a period of about five years, and\r\nwhose motion was predicted accordingly. The prediction was\r\ndisappointed; but the failure was sufficiently explained by the\r\ncomet's having passed close to Jupiter, by which occurrence its\r\norbit was utterly deranged.\r\n\r\nIt results from the theory of universal gravitation, that Comets are\r\ncollections of extremely attenuated matter. Lexell's is supposed to\r\nhave passed twice (in 1767 and 1779) through the system of Jupiter's\r\nSatellites, without disturbing their motions, though suffering\r\nitself so great a disturbance as to have its orbit entirely altered.\r\nThe same result is still more decidedly proved by the last\r\nappearance of Biela's Comet. It appeared double, but the two bodies\r\ndid not perceptibly affect each other's motions, as I am informed by\r\nProfessor Challis of Cambridge, who observed both of them from Jan.\r\n23 to Mar. 25, 1846. This proves the quantity of matter in each body\r\nto have been exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nThus, no verification of the Newtonian theory, which was possible in\r\nthe motions of the stars, has yet been wanting. The return of\r\nHalley's Comet again in 1835, and the extreme exactitude with which\r\nit conformed to its predicted course, is a testimony of truth, which\r\nmust appear striking even to the most incurious respecting such\r\nmatters.[101\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\7: M. de Humboldt (_Kosmos_, p. 116) speaks of _nine_\r\nreturns of Halley's Comet, the comet observed in China in 1378 being\r\nidentified with this. But whether we take 1378 or 1380 for the\r\nappearance in that century, if we begin with that, we have only\r\n_seven_ appearances, namely, in 1378 or 1380, in 1456, in 1531, in\r\n1607, in 1682, in 1759, and in 1835.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 7.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to the Figure of\r\nthe Earth._\r\n\r\nTHE Heavens had thus been consulted respecting the Newtonian\r\ndoctrine, and the answer given, over and over again, in a thousand\r\n{453} different forms, had been, that it was true; nor had the most\r\npersevering cross-examination been able to establish any thing of\r\ncontradiction or prevarication. The same question was also to be put\r\nto the Earth and the Ocean, and we must briefly notice the result.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Newtonian principles, the form of the earth must be\r\na globe somewhat flattened at the poles. This conclusion, or at\r\nleast the amount of the flattening, depends not only upon the\r\nexistence and law of attraction, but upon its belonging to each\r\nparticle of the mass separately; and thus the experimental\r\nconfirmation of the form asserted from calculation, would be a\r\nverification of the theory in its widest sense. The application of\r\nsuch a test was the more necessary to the interests of science,\r\ninasmuch as the French astronomers had collected from their measures,\r\nand had connected with their Cartesian system, the opinion that the\r\nearth was not _oblate_ but _oblong_. Dominic Cassini had measured\r\nseven degrees of latitude from Amiens to Perpignan, in 1701, and\r\nfound them to decrease in going from south to north. The prolongation\r\nof this measure to Dunkirk confirmed the same result. But if the\r\nNewtonian doctrine was true, the contrary ought to be the case, and\r\nthe degrees ought to increase in proceeding towards the pole.\r\n\r\nThe only answer which the Newtonians could at this time make to the\r\ndifficulty thus presented, was, that an arc so short as that thus\r\nmeasured, was not to be depended upon for the determination of such\r\na question; inasmuch as the inevitable errors of observation might\r\nexceed the differences which were the object of research. It would,\r\nundoubtedly, have become the English to have given a more complete\r\nanswer, by executing measurements under circumstances not liable to\r\nthis uncertainty. The glory of doing this, however, they for a long\r\ntime abandoned to other nations. The French undertook the task with\r\ngreat spirit.[102\\7] In 1733, in one of the meetings of the French\r\nAcademy, when this question was discussed, De la Condamine, an\r\nardent and eager man, proposed to settle this question by sending\r\nmembers of the Academy to measure a degree of the meridian near the\r\nequator, in order to compare it with the French degrees, and offered\r\nhimself for the expedition. Maupertuis, in like manner, urged the\r\nnecessity of another expedition to measure a degree in the\r\nneighborhood of the pole. The government received the applications\r\nfavorably, and these remarkable scientific missions were sent out at\r\nthe national expense. {454}\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\7: Bailly, iii. 11.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the result of these measurements was known, there was no\r\nlonger any doubt as to the fact of the earth's oblateness, and the\r\nquestion only turned upon its quantity. Even before the return of\r\nthe academicians, the Cassinis and Lacaille had measured the French\r\narc, and found errors which subverted the former result, making the\r\nearth oblate to the amount of 1⁄168th of its diameter. The\r\nexpeditions to Peru and to Lapland had to struggle with difficulties\r\nin the execution of their design, which make their narratives\r\nresemble some romantic history of irregular warfare, rather than the\r\nmonotonous records of mere measurements. The equatorial degree\r\nemployed the observers not less than eight years. When they did\r\nreturn, and the results were compared, their discrepancy, as to\r\nquantity, was considerable. The comparison of the Peruvian and\r\nFrench arcs gave an ellipticity of nearly 1⁄314th, that of the\r\nPeruvian and Swedish arcs gave 1⁄213th for its value.\r\n\r\nNewton had deduced from his theory, by reasonings of singular\r\ningenuity, an ellipticity of 1⁄230th; but this result had been\r\nobtained by supposing the earth homogeneous. If the earth be, as we\r\nshould most readily conjecture it to be, more dense in its interior\r\nthan at its exterior, its ellipticity will be less than that of a\r\nhomogeneous spheroid revolving in the same time. It does not appear\r\nthat Newton was aware of this; but Clairaut, in 1743, in his _Figure\r\nof the Earth_, proved this and many other important results of the\r\nattraction of the particles. Especially he established that, in\r\nproportion as the fraction expressing the Ellipticity becomes\r\nsmaller, that expressing the Excess of the polar over the equatorial\r\ngravity becomes larger; and he thus connected the measures of the\r\nellipticity obtained by means of Degrees, with those obtained by\r\nmeans of Pendulums in different latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe altered rate of a Pendulum when carried towards the equator, had\r\nbeen long ago observed by Richer and Halley, and had been quoted by\r\nNewton as confirmatory of his theory. Pendulums were swung by the\r\nacademicians who measured the degrees, and confirmed the general\r\ncharacter of the results.\r\n\r\nBut having reached this point of the verification of the Newtonian\r\ntheory, any additional step becomes more difficult. Many excellent\r\nmeasures, both of Degrees and of Pendulums, have been made since\r\nthose just mentioned. The results of the Arcs[103\\7] is an\r\nEllipticity of 1⁄298th;--of the Pendulums, an Ellipticity of about\r\n1⁄285th. This difference {455} is considerable, if compared with the\r\nquantities themselves; but does not throw a shadow of doubt on the\r\ntruth of the theory. Indeed, the observations of each kind exhibit\r\nirregularities which we may easily account for, by ascribing them to\r\nthe unknown distribution of the denser portions of the earth; but\r\nwhich preclude the extreme of accuracy and certainty in our result.\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\7: Airy, _Fig. Earth_, p. 230.]\r\n\r\nBut the near agreement of the determination, from Degrees and from\r\nPendulums, is not the only coincidence by which the doctrine is\r\nconfirmed. We can trace the effect of the earth's Oblateness in\r\ncertain minute apparent motions of the stars; for the attraction of\r\nthe sun and moon on the protuberant matter of the spheroid produces\r\nthe Precession of the equinoxes, and a Nutation of the earth's axis.\r\nThe Precession had been known from the time of Hipparchus, and the\r\nexistence of Nutation was foreseen by Newton; but the quantity is so\r\nsmall, that it required consummate skill and great labor in Bradley\r\nto detect it by astronomical observation. Being, however, so\r\ndetected, its amount, as well as that of the Precession, gives us\r\nthe means of determining the amount of Terrestrial Ellipticity, by\r\nwhich the effect is produced. But it is found, upon calculation,\r\nthat we cannot obtain this determination without assuming some law\r\nof density in the homogeneous strata of which we suppose the earth\r\nto consist[104\\7] The density will certainly increase in proceeding\r\ntowards the centre, and there is a simple and probable law of this\r\nincrease, which will give 1⁄300th for the Ellipticity, from the\r\namount of two lunar Inequalities (one in latitude and one in\r\nlongitude), which are produced by the earth's oblateness. Nearly the\r\nsame result follows from the quantity of Nutation. Thus every thing\r\ntends to convince us that the ellipticity cannot deviate much from\r\nthis fraction.\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\7: Airy, _Fig. Earth_, p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [I ought not to omit another class of phenomena in which\r\nthe effects of the Earth's Oblateness, acting according to the law\r\nof universal gravitation, have manifested themselves;--I speak of\r\nthe Moon's Motion, as affected by the Earth's Ellipticity. In this\r\ncase, as in most others, observation anticipated theory. Mason had\r\ninferred from lunar observations a certain Inequality in Longitude,\r\ndepending upon the distance of the Moon's Node from the Equinox.\r\nDoubts were entertained by astronomers whether this inequality\r\nreally existed; but Laplace showed that such an inequality would\r\narise from the oblate form of the earth; and that its magnitude\r\nmight serve to {456} determine the amount of the oblateness. Laplace\r\nshowed, at the same time, that along with this Inequality in\r\nLongitude there must be an Inequality in Latitude; and this\r\nassertion Burg confirmed by the discussion of observations. The two\r\nInequalities, as shown in the observations, agree in assigning to\r\nthe earth's form an Ellipticity of 1⁄305th.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 8.--_Confirmation of the Newtonian Theory by Experiments on\r\nAttraction._\r\n\r\nTHE attraction of all the parts of the earth to one another was thus\r\nproved by experiments, in which the whole mass of the earth is\r\nconcerned. But attempts have also been made to measure the\r\nattraction of smaller portions; as mountains, or artificial masses.\r\nThis is an experiment of great difficulty; for the attraction of\r\nsuch masses must be compared with that of the earth, of which it is\r\na scarcely perceptible fraction; and, moreover, in the case of\r\nmountains, the effect of the mountain will be modified or disguised\r\nby unknown or unappreciable circumstances. In many of the\r\nmeasurements of degrees, indications of the attraction of mountains\r\nhad been perceived; but at the suggestion of Maskelyne, the\r\nexperiment was carefully made, in 1774, upon the mountain\r\nSchehallien, in Scotland, the mountain being mineralogically\r\nsurveyed by Playfair. The result obtained was, that the attraction\r\nof the mountain drew the plumb-line about six seconds from the\r\nvertical; and it was deduced from this, by Hutton's calculations,\r\nthat the density of the earth was about once and four-fifths that of\r\nSchehallien, or four and a half times that of water.\r\n\r\nCavendish, who had suggested many of the artifices in this\r\ncalculation, himself made the experiment in the other form, by using\r\nleaden balls, about nine inches diameter. This observation was\r\nconducted with an extreme degree of ingenuity and delicacy, which\r\ncould alone make it valuable; and the result agreed very nearly with\r\nthat of the Schehallien experiment, giving for the density of the\r\nearth about five and one-third times that of water. Nearly the same\r\nresult was obtained by Carlini, in 1824, from observations of the\r\npendulum, made at a point of the Alps (the Hospice, on Mount Cenis) at\r\na considerable elevation above the average surface of the earth. {457}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 9.--_Application of the Newtonian Theory to the Tides._\r\n\r\nWE come, finally, to that result, in which most remains to be done\r\nfor the verification of the general law of attraction--the subject\r\nof the Tides. Yet, even here, the verification is striking, as far\r\nas observations have been carried. Newton's theory explained, with\r\nsingular felicity, all the prominent circumstances of the tides then\r\nknown;--the difference of spring and neap tides; the effect of the\r\nmoon's and sun's declination and parallax; even the difference of\r\nmorning and evening tides, and the anomalous tides of particular\r\nplaces. About, and after, this time, attempts were made both by the\r\nRoyal Society of England, and by the French Academy, to collect\r\nnumerous observations  but these were not followed up with\r\nsufficient perseverance. Perhaps, indeed, the theory had not been at\r\nthat time sufficiently developed  but the admirable prize-essays of\r\nEuler, Bernoulli, and D'Alembert, in 1740, removed, in a great\r\nmeasure, this deficiency. These dissertations supplied the means of\r\nbringing this subject to the same test to which all the other\r\nconsequences of gravitation had been subjected;--namely, the\r\ncalculation of tables, and the continued and orderly comparison of\r\nthese with observation. Laplace has attempted this verification in\r\nanother way, by calculating the results of the theory (which he has\r\ndone with an extraordinary command of analysis), and then by\r\ncomparing these, in supposed critical cases, with the Brest\r\nobservations. This method has confirmed the theory as far as it\r\ncould do so; but such a process cannot supersede the necessity of\r\napplying the proper criterion of truth in such cases, the\r\nconstruction and verification of Tables. Bernoulli's theory, on the\r\nother hand, has been used for the construction of Tide-tables; but\r\nthese have not been properly compared with experiment; and when the\r\ncomparison has been made, having been executed for purposes of gain\r\nrather than of science, it has not been published, and cannot be\r\nquoted as a verification of the theory.\r\n\r\nThus we have, as yet, no sufficient comparison of fact with theory,\r\nfor Laplace's is far from a complete comparison. In this, as in\r\nother parts of physical astronomy, our theory ought not only to\r\nagree with observations selected and grouped in a particular manner,\r\nbut with the whole course of observation, and with every part of the\r\nphenomena. In this, as in other cases, the true theory should be\r\nverified by its giving us the best Tables; but Tide-tables were\r\nnever, I believe, {458} calculated upon Laplace's theory, and thus\r\nit was never fairly brought to the test.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, remarkable, considering all the experience which\r\nastronomy had furnished, that men should have expected to reach the\r\ncompletion of this branch of science by improving the mathematical\r\ntheory, without, at the same time, ascertaining the laws of the\r\nfacts. In all other departments of astronomy, as, for instance, in\r\nthe cases of the moon and the planets, the leading features of the\r\nphenomena had been made out empirically, before the theory explained\r\nthem. The course which analogy would have recommended for the\r\ncultivation of our knowledge of the tides, would have been, to\r\nascertain, by an analysis of long series of observations, the effect\r\nof changes in the time of transit, parallax, and declination of the\r\nmoon, and thus to obtain the laws of phenomena  and then proceed to\r\ninvestigate the laws of causation.\r\n\r\nThough this was not the course followed by mathematical theorists,\r\nit was really pursued by those who practically calculated\r\nTide-tables; and the application of knowledge to the useful purposes\r\nof life being thus separated from the promotion of the theory, was\r\nnaturally treated as a gainful property, and preserved by secrecy.\r\nArt, in this instance, having cast off her legitimate subordination\r\nto Science, or rather, being deprived of the guidance which it was\r\nthe duty of Science to afford, resumed her ancient practices of\r\nexclusiveness and mystery. Liverpool, London, and other places, had\r\ntheir Tide-tables, constructed by undivulged methods, which methods,\r\nin some instances at least, were handed down from father to son for\r\nseveral generations as a family possession; and the publication of\r\nnew Tables, accompanied by a statement of the mode of calculation,\r\nwas resented as an infringement of the rights of property.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which these secret methods were invented, was that which\r\nwe have pointed out;--the analysis of a considerable series of\r\nobservations. Probably the best example of this was afforded by the\r\nLiverpool Tide-tables. These were deduced by a clergyman named\r\nHolden, from observations made at that port by a harbor-master of\r\nthe name of Hutchinson; who was led, by a love of such pursuits, to\r\nobserve the tides carefully for above twenty years, day and night.\r\nHolden's Tables, founded on four years of these observations, were\r\nremarkably accurate.\r\n\r\nAt length men of science began to perceive that such calculations\r\nwere part of their business; and that they were called upon, as the\r\n{459} guardians of the established theory of the universe, to\r\ncompare it in the greatest possible detail with the facts. Mr.\r\nLubbock was the first mathematician who undertook the extensive\r\nlabors which such a conviction suggested. Finding that regular\r\ntide-observations had been made at the London Docks from 1795, he\r\ntook nineteen years of these (purposely selecting the length of a\r\ncycle of the motions of the lunar orbit), and caused them (in 1831)\r\nto be analyzed by Mr. Dessiou, an expert calculator. He thus\r\nobtained[105\\7] Tables for the effect of the Moon's Declination,\r\nParallax, and hour of Transit, on the tides; and was enabled to\r\nproduce Tide-tables founded upon the data thus obtained. Some\r\nmistakes in these as first published (mistakes unimportant as to the\r\ntheoretical value of the work), served to show the jealousy of the\r\npractical tide-table calculators, by the acrimony with which the\r\noversights were dwelt upon; but in a very few years, the tables thus\r\nproduced by an open and scientific process were more exact than\r\nthose which resulted from any of the secrets; and thus practice was\r\nbrought into its proper subordination to theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 105\\7: _Phil. Trans._ 1831. _British Almanac_, 1832.]\r\n\r\nThe theory with which Mr. Lubbock was led to compare his results, was\r\nthe Equilibrium-theory of Daniel Bernoulli; and it was found that this\r\ntheory, with certain modifications of its elements, represented the\r\nfacts to a remarkable degree of precision. Mr. Lubbock pointed out\r\nthis agreement especially in the semi-mensual inequality of the times\r\nof high water. The like agreement was afterwards (in 1833) shown by\r\nMr. Whewell[106\\7] to obtain still more accurately at Liverpool, both\r\nfor the Times and Heights; for by this time, nineteen years of\r\nHutchinson's Liverpool Observations had also been discussed by Mr.\r\nLubbock. The other inequalities of the Times and Heights (depending\r\nupon the Declination and Parallax of the Moon and Sun,) were variously\r\ncompared with the Equilibrium-theory by Mr. Lubbock and Mr. Whewell;\r\nand the general result was, that the facts agreed with the condition\r\nof equilibrium at a certain anterior time, but that this anterior time\r\nwas different for different phenomena. In like manner it appeared to\r\nfollow from these researches, that in order to explain the facts, the\r\nmass of the moon must be supposed different in the calculation at\r\ndifferent places. A result in effect the same was obtained by M.\r\nDaussy,[107\\7] an active French Hydrographer; for he found that\r\nobservations at various stations could not be reconciled with the\r\nformulæ of Laplace's _Mécanique_ {460} _Céleste_ (in which the ratio\r\nof the heights of spring-tides and neap-tides was computed on an\r\nassumed mass of the moon) without an alteration of level which was, in\r\nfact, equivalent to an alteration of the moon's mass. Thus all things\r\nappeared to tend to show that the Equilibrium-theory would give the\r\n_formulæ_ for the inequalities of the tides, but that the _magnitudes_\r\nwhich enter into these formulæ must be sought from observation.\r\n\r\n[Note 106\\7: _Phil. Trans._ 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Note 107\\7: _Connaissance des Tems_, 1838.]\r\n\r\nWhether this result is consistent with theory, is a question not so\r\nmuch of Physical Astronomy as of Hydrodynamics, and has not yet been\r\nsolved. A Theory of the Tides which should include in its conditions\r\nthe phenomena of Derivative Tides, and of their combinations, will\r\nprobably require all the resources of the mathematical mechanician.\r\n\r\nAs a contribution of empirical materials to the treatment of this\r\nhydrodynamical problem, it may be allowable to mention here Mr.\r\nWhewell's attempts to trace the progress of the tide into all the\r\nseas of the globe, by drawing on maps of the ocean what he calls\r\n_Cotidal Lines_;--lines marking the contemporaneous position of the\r\nvarious points of the great wave which carries high water from shore\r\nto shore.[108\\7] This is necessarily a task of labor and difficulty,\r\nsince it requires us to know the time of high water on the same day\r\nin every part of the world; but in proportion as it is completed, it\r\nsupplies steps between our general view of the movements of the\r\nocean and the phenomena of particular ports.\r\n\r\n[Note 108\\7: Essay towards a First Approximation to a Map of Cotidal\r\nLines. _Phil. Trans._ 1833, 1836.]\r\n\r\nLooking at this subject by the light which the example of the\r\nhistory of astronomy affords, we may venture to repeat, that it will\r\nnever have justice done it till it is treated as other parts of\r\nastronomy are treated; that is, till Tables of all the phenomena\r\nwhich can be observed, are calculated by means of the best knowledge\r\nwhich we at present possess, and till these tables are constantly\r\nimproved by a comparison of the predicted with the observed fact. A\r\nset of Tide-observations and Tide-ephemerides of this kind, would\r\nsoon give to this subject that precision which marks the other parts\r\nof astronomy; and would leave an assemblage of unexplained _residual\r\nphenomena_, in which a careful research might find the materials of\r\nother truths as yet unsuspected.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [That there would be, in the tidal movements of the ocean,\r\ninequalities of the heights and times of high and low water {461}\r\n_corresponding_ to those which the equilibrium theory gives, could\r\nbe considered only as a conjecture, till the comparison with\r\nobservation was made. It was, however, a natural conjecture; since\r\nthe waters of the ocean are at every moment _tending_ to acquire the\r\nform assumed in the equilibrium theory: and it may be considered\r\nlikely that the causes which prevent their assuming this form\r\nproduce an effect nearly constant for each place. Whatever be\r\nthought of this reasoning, the conjecture is confirmed by\r\nobservation with curious exactness. The laws of a great number of\r\nthe tidal phenomena--namely, of the Semi-mensual Inequality of the\r\nHeights, of the Semi-mensual Inequality of the Times, of the Diurnal\r\nInequality, of the effect of the Moon's Declination, of the effect\r\nof the Moon's Parallax--are represented very closely by formulæ\r\nderived from the equilibrium theory. The hydrodynamical mode of\r\ntreating the subject has not added any thing to the knowledge of the\r\nlaws of the phenomena to which the other view had conducted us.\r\n\r\nWe may add, that Laplace's assumption, that in the moving fluid the\r\nmotions must have a _periodicity_ corresponding to that of the\r\nforces, is also a conjecture. And though this conjecture may, in\r\nsome cases of the problem, be verified, by substituting the\r\nresulting expressions in the equations of motion, this cannot be\r\ndone in the actual case, where the revolving motion of the ocean is\r\nprevented by the intrusion of tracts of land running nearly from\r\npole to pole.\r\n\r\nYet in Mr. Airy's Treatise _On Tides and Waves_ (in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Metropolitana_) much has been done to bring the\r\nhydrodynamical theory of oceanic tides into agreement with\r\nobservation. In this admirable work, Mr. Airy has, by peculiar\r\nartifices, solved problems which come so near the actual cases that\r\nthey may represent them. He has, in this way, deduced the laws of\r\nthe semi-diurnal and the diurnal tide, and the other features of the\r\ntides which the equilibrium theory in some degree imitates; but he\r\nhas also, taking into account the effect of friction, shown that the\r\nactual tide may be represented as the tide of an earlier\r\nepoch;--that the relative mass of the moon and sun, as inferred from\r\nthe tides, would depend upon the depth of the ocean (Art.\r\n455);--with many other results remarkably explaining the observed\r\nphenomena. He has also shown that the relation of the cotidal lines\r\nto the tide waves really propagated is, in complex cases, very\r\nobscure, because different waves of different magnitudes, travelling\r\nin different directions, may coexist, and the cotidal line is the\r\ncompound result of all these. {462}\r\n\r\nWith reference to the _Maps of Cotidal Lines_, mentioned in the\r\ntext, I may add, that we are as yet destitute of observations which\r\nshould supply the means of drawing such lines on a large scale in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. Admiral Lütke has however supplied us with some\r\nvaluable materials and remarks on this subject in his _Notice sur\r\nles Marées Périodiques dans le grand Océan Boréal et dans la Mer\r\nGlaciale_; and has drawn them, apparently on sufficient data, in the\r\nWhite Sea.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERIES ADDED TO THE NEWTONIAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Tables of Astronomical Refraction._\r\n\r\nWE have travelled over an immense field of astronomical and\r\nmathematical labor in the last few pages, and have yet, at the end\r\nof every step, still found ourselves under the jurisdiction of the\r\nNewtonian laws. We are reminded of the universal monarchies, where a\r\nman could not escape from the empire without quitting the world. We\r\nhave now to notice some other discoveries, in which this reference\r\nto the law of universal gravitation is less immediate and obvious; I\r\nmean the astronomical discoveries respecting Light.\r\n\r\nThe general truths to which the establishment of the true laws of\r\nAtmospheric Refraction led astronomers, were the law of Deflection\r\nof the rays of light, which applies to all refractions, and the real\r\nstructure and size of the Atmosphere, so far as it became known. The\r\ngreat discoveries of Römer and Bradley, namely, the Velocity of\r\nLight, the Aberration of Light, and the Nutation of the earth's\r\naxis, gave a new distinctness to the conceptions of the propagation\r\nof light in the minds of philosophers, and confirmed the doctrines\r\nof Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton, respecting the motions which\r\nbelong to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe true laws of Atmospheric Refraction were slowly discovered.\r\nTycho attributed the apparent displacement of the heavenly bodies to\r\nthe low and gross part of the atmosphere only, and hence made it\r\ncease at a point half-way to the zenith; but Kepler rightly extended\r\nit to the zenith itself. Dominic Cassini endeavored to discover the\r\nlaw of this correction by observation, and gave his result in the\r\nform {463} which, as we have said, sound science prescribes, a Table\r\nto be habitually used for all observations. But great difficulties\r\nat this time embarrassed this investigation, for the parallaxes of\r\nthe sun and of the planets were unknown, and very diverse values had\r\nbeen assigned them by different astronomers. To remove some of these\r\ndifficulties, Richer, in 1762, went to observe at the equator; and\r\non his return, Cassini was able to confirm and amend his former\r\nestimations of parallax and refraction. But there were still\r\ndifficulties. According to La Hire, though the phenomena of twilight\r\ngive an altitude of 34,000 toises to the atmosphere,[109\\7] those of\r\nrefraction make it only 2000. John Cassini undertook to support and\r\nimprove the calculations of his father Dominic, and took the true\r\nsupposition, that the light follows a curvilinear path through the\r\nair. The Royal Society of London had already ascertained\r\nexperimentally the refractive power of air.[110\\7] Newton calculated\r\na Table of Refractions, which was published under Halley's name in\r\nthe _**Philosophical Transactions_ for 1721, without any indication\r\nof the method by which it was constructed. But M. Biot has recently\r\nshown,[111\\7] by means of the published correspondence of Flamsteed,\r\nthat Newton had solved the problem in a manner nearly corresponding\r\nto the most improved methods of modern analysis.\r\n\r\n[Note 109\\7: Bailly, ii. 612.]\r\n\r\n[Note 110\\7: Ibid. ii. 607.]\r\n\r\n[Note 111\\7: Biot, _Acad. Sc. Compte Rendu_, Sept. 5, 1836.]\r\n\r\nDominic Cassini and Picard proved,[112\\7] Le Monnier in 1738\r\nconfirmed more fully, the fact that the variations of the\r\nThermometer affect the Refraction. Mayer, taking into account both\r\nthese changes, and the changes indicated by the Barometer, formed a\r\ntheory, which Lacaille, with immense labor, applied to the\r\nconstruction of a Table of Refractions from observation. But\r\nBradley's Table (published in 1763 by Maskelyne) was more commonly\r\nadopted in England; and his formula, originally obtained\r\nempirically, has been shown by Young to result from the most\r\nprobable suppositions we can make respecting the atmosphere.\r\nBessel's Refraction Tables are now considered the best of those\r\nwhich have appeared.\r\n\r\n[Note 112\\7: Bailly, iii. 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Discovery of the Velocity of Light.--Römer._\r\n\r\nTHE astronomical history of Refraction is not marked by any great\r\ndiscoveries, and was, for the most part, a work of labor only. The\r\nprogress of the other portions of our knowledge respecting light is\r\n{464} more striking. In 1676, a great number of observations of\r\neclipses of Jupiter's satellites were accumulated, and could be\r\ncompared with Cassini's Tables. Römer, a Danish astronomer, whom\r\nPicard had brought to Paris, perceived that these eclipses happened\r\nconstantly later than the calculated time at one season of the year,\r\nand earlier at another season;--a difference for which astronomy\r\ncould offer no account. The error was the same for all the\r\nsatellites; if it had depended on a defect in the Tables of Jupiter,\r\nit might have affected all, but the effect would have had a\r\nreference to the velocities of the satellites. The cause, then, was\r\nsomething extraneous to Jupiter. Römer had the happy thought of\r\ncomparing the error with the earth's distance from Jupiter, and it\r\nwas found that the eclipses happened later in proportion as Jupiter\r\nwas further off.[113\\7] Thus we see the eclipse later, as it is more\r\nremote; and thus light, the messenger which brings us intelligence\r\nof the occurrence, travels over its course in a measurable time. By\r\nthis evidence, light appeared to take about eleven minutes in\r\ndescribing the diameter of the earth's orbit.\r\n\r\n[Note 113\\7: Bailly, ii. 17.]\r\n\r\nThis discovery, like so many others, once made, appears easy and\r\ninevitable; yet Dominic Cassini had entertained the idea for a\r\nmoment,[114\\7] and had rejected it; and Fontenelle had congratulated\r\nhimself publicly on having narrowly escaped this seductive error.\r\nThe objections to the admission of the truth arose principally from\r\nthe inaccuracy of observation, and from the persuasion that the\r\nmotions of the satellites were circular and uniform. Their\r\nirregularities disguised the fact in question. As these irregularities\r\nbecame clearly known, Römer's discovery was finally established, and\r\nthe \"Equation of Light\" took its place in the Tables.\r\n\r\n[Note 114\\7: Ib. ii. 419.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Discovery of Aberration.--Bradley._\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS in instruments, and in the art of observing, were\r\nrequisite for making the next great step in tracing the effect of\r\nthe laws of light. It appears clear, on consideration, that since\r\nlight and the spectator on the earth are both in motion, the\r\napparent direction of an object will be determined by the\r\ncomposition of these motions. But yet the effect of this composition\r\nof motions was (as is usual in such cases) traced as a fact in\r\nobservation, before it was clearly seen as a consequence of\r\nreasoning. This fact, the Aberration of Light, the greatest\r\nastronomical discovery of the eighteenth century, belongs to\r\nBradley, {465} who was then Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and\r\nafterwards Astronomer Royal at Greenwich. Molyneux and Bradley, in\r\n1725, began a series of observations for the purpose of\r\nascertaining, by observations near the zenith, the existence of an\r\nannual parallax of the fixed stars, which Hooke had hoped to detect,\r\nand Flamsteed thought he had discovered. Bradley[115\\7] soon found\r\nthat the star observed by him had a minute apparent motion different\r\nfrom that which the annual parallax would produce. He thought of a\r\nnutation of the earth's axis as a mode of accounting for this; but\r\nfound, by comparison of a star on the other side of the pole, that\r\nthis explanation would not apply. Bradley and Molyneux then\r\nconsidered for a moment an annual alteration of figure in the\r\nearth's atmosphere, such as might affect the refractions, but this\r\nhypothesis was soon rejected.[116\\7] In 1727, Bradley resumed his\r\nobservations, with a new instrument, at Wanstead, and obtained\r\nempirical rules for the changes of declination of different stars.\r\nAt last, accident turned his thoughts to the direction in which he\r\nwas to find the cause of the variations which he had discovered.\r\nBeing in a boat on the Thames, he observed that the vane on the top\r\nof the mast gave a different apparent direction to the wind, as the\r\nboat sailed one way or the other. Here was an image of his case: the\r\nboat represented the earth moving in different directions at\r\ndifferent seasons, and the wind represented the light of a star. He\r\nhad now to trace the consequences of this idea; he found that it led\r\nto the empirical rules, which he had already discovered, and, in\r\n1729, he gave his discovery to the Royal Society. His paper is a\r\nvery happy narrative of his labors and his thoughts. His theory was\r\nso sound that no astronomer ever contested it; and his observations\r\nwere so accurate, that the quantity which he assigned as the\r\ngreatest amount of the change (one nineteenth of a degree) has\r\nhardly been corrected by more recent astronomers. It must be\r\nnoticed, however, that he considered the effects in declination\r\nonly; the effects in right ascension required a different mode of\r\nobservation, and a consummate goodness in the machinery of clocks,\r\nwhich at that time was hardly attained.\r\n\r\n[Note 115\\7: Rigaud's Bradley.]\r\n\r\n[Note 116\\7: Rigaud, p. xxiii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Discovery of Nutation._\r\n\r\nWHEN Bradley went to Greenwich as Astronomer Royal, he continued\r\nwith perseverance observations of the same kind as those by which he\r\nhad detected Aberration. The result of these was another {466}\r\ndiscovery; namely, that very Nutation which he had formerly\r\nrejected. This may appear strange, but it is easily explained. The\r\naberration is an annual change, and is detected by observing a star\r\nat different seasons of the year: the Nutation is a change of which\r\nthe cycle is eighteen years; and which, therefore, though it does\r\nnot much change the place of a star in one year, is discoverable in\r\nthe alterations of several successive years. A very few years'\r\nobservations showed Bradley the effect of this change;[117\\7] and\r\nlong before the half cycle of nine years had elapsed, he had\r\nconnected it in his mind with the true cause, the motion of the\r\nmoon's nodes. Machin was then Secretary to the Royal Society,[118\\7]\r\nand was \"employed in considering the theory of gravity, and its\r\nconsequences with regard to the celestial motions:\" to him Bradley\r\ncommunicated his conjectures; from him he soon received a Table\r\ncontaining the results of his calculations; and the law was found to\r\nbe the same in the Table and in observation, though the quantities\r\nwere somewhat different. It appeared by both, that the earth's pole,\r\nbesides the motion which the precession of the equinoxes gives it,\r\nmoves, in eighteen years, through a small circle;--or rather, as was\r\nafterwards found by Bradley, an ellipse, of which the axes are\r\nnineteen and fourteen seconds.[119\\7]\r\n\r\n[Note 117\\7: Rigaud, lxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 118\\7: Ib. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Note 119\\7: Ib. lxvi.]\r\n\r\nFor the rigorous establishment of the mechanical theory of that\r\neffect of the moon's attraction from which the phenomena of Nutation\r\nflow, Bradley rightly and prudently invited the assistance of the\r\ngreat mathematicians of his time. D'Alembert, Thomas Simpson, Euler,\r\nand others, answered this call, and the result was, as we have\r\nalready said in the last chapter (Sect. 7), that this investigation\r\nadded another to the recondite and profound evidences of the\r\ndoctrine of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nIt has been said[120\\7] that Bradley's discoveries \"assure him the\r\nmost distinguished place among astronomers after Hipparchus and\r\nKepler.\" If his discoveries had been made before Newton's, there\r\ncould have been no hesitation as to placing him on a level with\r\nthose great men. The existence of such suggestions as the Newtonian\r\ntheory offered on all astronomical subjects, may perhaps dim, in our\r\neyes, the brilliance of Bradley's achievements; but this\r\ncircumstance cannot place any other person above the author of such\r\ndiscoveries, and therefore we may consider Delambre's adjudication\r\nof precedence as well warranted, and deserving to be permanent. {467}\r\n\r\n[Note 120\\7: Delambre, _Ast. du_ 18 _Sièc._ p. 420. Rigaud, xxxvii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Discovery of the Laws of Double Stars.--The two\r\nHerschels._\r\n\r\nNO truth, then, can be more certainly established, than that the law\r\nof gravitation prevails to the very boundaries of the solar system.\r\nBut does it hold good further? Do the fixed stars also obey this\r\nuniversal sway? The idea, the question, is an obvious one--but where\r\nare we to find the means of submitting it to the test of observation?\r\n\r\nIf the Stars were each insulated from the rest, as our Sun appears\r\nto be from them, we should have been quite unable to answer this\r\ninquiry. But among the stars, there are some which are called\r\n_Double Stars_, and which consist of two stars, so near to each\r\nother that the telescope alone can separate them. The elder Herschel\r\ndiligently observed and measured the relative positions of the two\r\nstars in such pairs; and as has so often happened in astronomical\r\nhistory, pursuing one object he fell in with another. Supposing such\r\npairs to be really unconnected, he wished to learn, from their\r\nphenomena, something respecting the annual parallax of the earth's\r\norbit. But in the course of twenty years' observations he made the\r\ndiscovery (in 1803) that some of these couples were turning round\r\neach other with various angular velocities. These revolutions were\r\nfor the most part so slow that he was obliged to leave their\r\ncomplete determination as an inheritance to the next generation. His\r\nson was not careless of the bequest, and after having added an\r\nenormous mass of observations to those of his father, he applied\r\nhimself to determine the laws of these revolutions. A problem so\r\nobvious and so tempting was attacked also by others, as Savary and\r\nEncke, in 1830 and 1832, with the resources of analysis. But a\r\nproblem in which the data are so minute and inevitably imperfect,\r\nrequired the mathematician to employ much judgment, as well as skill\r\nin using and combining these data; and Sir John Herschel, by\r\nemploying positions only of the line joining the pair of stars\r\n(which can be observed with comparative exactness), to the exclusion\r\nof their distances (which cannot be measured with much correctness),\r\nand by inventing a method which depended upon the whole body of\r\nobservations, and not upon selected ones only, for the determination\r\nof the motion, has made his investigations by far the most\r\nsatisfactory of those which have appeared. The result is, that it\r\nhas been rendered very probable, that in several of the double stars\r\nthe two stars describe ellipses about each other; and therefore that\r\nhere also, at an {468} immeasurable distance from our system, the\r\nlaw of attraction according to the inverse square of the distance,\r\nprevails. And, according to the practice of astronomers when a law\r\nhas been established, Tables have been calculated for the future\r\nmotions; and we have Ephemerides of the revolutions of suns round\r\neach other, in a region so remote, that the whole circle of our\r\nearth's orbit, if placed there, would be imperceptible by our\r\nstrongest telescopes. The permanent comparison of the observed with\r\nthe predicted motions, continued for more than one revolution, is\r\nthe severe and decisive test of the truth of the theory; and the\r\nresult of this test astronomers are now awaiting.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [In calculating the orbits of revolving systems of double\r\nstars, there is a peculiar difficulty, arising from the plane of the\r\norbit being in a position unknown, but probably oblique, to the\r\nvisual ray. Hence it comes to pass that even if the orbit be an\r\nellipse described about the focus by the laws of planetary motion,\r\nit will appear otherwise; and the true orbit will have to be deduced\r\nfrom the apparent one.\r\n\r\nWith regard to a difficulty which has been mentioned, that the two\r\nstars, if they are governed by gravity, will not revolve the one\r\nabout the other, but both about their common centre of\r\ngravity;--this circumstance adds little difficulty to the problem.\r\nNewton has shown (_Princip._ lib. i. Prop. 61) in the _problem of\r\ntwo bodies_, the relation between the relative orbits and the orbit\r\nabout the common centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n_How many of the apparently double stars have orbitual motions?_ Sir\r\nJohn Herschel in 1833 gave, in his _Astronomy_ (Art. 606), a list of\r\nnine stars, with periods extending from 43 years (η Coronæ) to 1200\r\nyears (γ Leonis), which he presented as the chief results then\r\nobtained in this department. In his work on Double Stars, the fruit\r\nof his labors in both hemispheres, which the astronomical world are\r\nlooking for with eager expectation, he will, I believe, have a few\r\nmore to add to these.\r\n\r\n_Is it well established that such double stars attract each other\r\naccording to the law of the inverse square of the distance?_ The\r\nanswer to this question must be determined by ascertaining whether the\r\nabove cases are regulated by the laws of elliptical motion. This is a\r\nmatter which it must require a long course of careful observation to\r\ndetermine in such a number of cases as to prove the universality of\r\nthe rule. Perhaps the minds of astronomers are still in suspense upon\r\nthe subject. When Sir John Herschel's work shall appear, it will\r\nprobably {469} be found that with regard to some of these stars, and γ\r\nVirginis in particular, the conformity of the observations with the\r\nlaws of elliptical motion amounts to a degree of exactness which must\r\ngive astronomers a strong conviction of the truth of the law. For\r\nsince Sir W. Herschel's first measures in 1781, the arc described by\r\none star about the other is above 305 degrees; and during this period\r\nthe angular annual motion has been very various, passing through all\r\ngradations from about 20 minutes to 80 degrees. Yet in the whole of\r\nthis change, the two curves constructed, the one from the\r\nobservations, the other from the elliptical elements, for the purpose\r\nof comparison, having a total ordinate of 305 parts, do not, in any\r\npart of their course, deviate from each other so much as _two_ such\r\nparts.]\r\n\r\nThe verification of Newton's discoveries was sufficient employment\r\nfor the last century; the first step in the extension of them\r\nbelongs to this century. We cannot at present foresee the magnitude\r\nof this task, but every one must feel that the law of gravitation,\r\nbefore verified in all the particles of our own system, and now\r\nprobably extended to the all but infinite distance of the fixed\r\nstars, presses upon our minds with a strong claim to be accepted as\r\na universal law of the whole material creation.\r\n\r\nThus, in this and the preceding chapter, I have given a brief sketch\r\nof the history of the verification and extension of Newton's great\r\ndiscovery. By the mass of labor and of skill which this head of our\r\nsubject includes, we may judge of the magnitude of the advance in\r\nour knowledge which that discovery made. A wonderful amount of\r\ntalent and industry have been requisite for this purpose; but with\r\nthese, external means have co-operated. Wealth, authority,\r\nmechanical skill, the division of labor, the power of associations\r\nand of governments, have been largely and worthily applied in\r\nbringing astronomy to its present high and flourishing condition. We\r\nmust consider briefly what has thus been done. {470}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE INSTRUMENTS AND AIDS OF ASTRONOMY DURING THE NEWTONIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Instruments._\r\n\r\nSOME instruments or other were employed at all periods of\r\nastronomical observation. But it was only when observation had\r\nattained a considerable degree of delicacy, that the exact\r\nconstruction of instruments became an object of serious care.\r\nGradually, as the possibility and the value of increased exactness\r\nbecame manifest, it was seen that every thing which could improve\r\nthe astronomer's instruments was of high importance to him. And\r\nhence in some cases a vast increase of size and of expense was\r\nintroduced; in other cases new combinations, or the result of\r\nimprovements in other sciences, were brought into play. Extensive\r\nknowledge, intense thought, and great ingenuity, were requisite in\r\nthe astronomical instrument maker. Instead of ranking with artisans,\r\nhe became a man of science, sharing the honor and dignity of the\r\nastronomer himself.\r\n\r\n1. _Measure of Angles._--Tycho Brahe was the first astronomer who\r\nacted upon a due appreciation of the importance of good instruments.\r\nThe collection of such at Uraniburg was by far the finest which had\r\never existed. He endeavored to give steadiness to the frame, and\r\naccuracy to the divisions of his instruments. His Mural Quadrant was\r\nwell adapted for this purpose; its radius was five cubits: it is\r\nclear, that as we enlarge the instrument we are enabled to measure\r\nsmaller arcs. On this principle many large _gnomons_ were erected.\r\nCassini's celebrated one in the church of St. Petronius at Bologna,\r\nwas eighty-three feet (French) high. But this mode of obtaining\r\naccuracy was soon abandoned for better methods. Three great\r\nimprovements were introduced about the same time. The application of\r\nthe Micrometer to the telescope, by Huyghens, Malvasia, and Auzout;\r\nthe application of the Telescope to the astronomical quadrant; and\r\nthe fixation of the centre of its field by a Cross of fine wires\r\nplaced in the focus by Gascoigne, and afterwards by Picard. We may\r\njudge how great was the improvement which these contrivances\r\nintroduced into the art of {471} observing, by finding that Hevelius\r\nrefused to adopt them because they would make all the old\r\nobservations of no value. He had spent a laborious and active life\r\nin the exercise of the old methods, and could not bear to think that\r\nall the treasures which he had accumulated had lost their worth by\r\nthe discovery of a new mine of richer ore.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [Littrow, in his _Die Wunder des Himmels_, Ed. 2, pp. 684,\r\n685, says that Gascoigne invented and used the telescope with wires\r\nin the common focus of the lenses in 1640. He refers to _Phil.\r\nTrans._ xxx. 603. Picard reinvented this arrangement in 1667. I have\r\nalready spoken of Gascoigne as the inventor of the micrometer.\r\n\r\nRömer (already mentioned, p. 464) brought into use the Transit\r\nInstrument, and the employment of complete Circles, instead of the\r\nQuadrants used till then; and by these means gave to practical\r\nastronomy a new form, of which the full value was not discovered\r\ntill long afterwards.**]\r\n\r\nThe apparent place of the object in the instrument being so\r\nprecisely determined by the new methods, the exact Division of the\r\narc into degrees and their subdivisions became a matter of great\r\nconsequence. A series of artists, principally English, have acquired\r\ndistinguished places in the lists of scientific fame by their\r\nperformances in this way; and from that period, particular\r\ninstruments have possessed historical interest and individual\r\nreputation. Graham was one of the first of these artists. He\r\nexecuted a great Mural Arc for Halley at Greenwich; for Bradley he\r\nconstructed the Sector which detected aberration. He also made the\r\nSector which the French academicians carried to Lapland; and\r\nprobably the goodness of this instrument, compared with the\r\nimperfection of those which were sent to Peru, was one main cause of\r\nthe great difference of duration in the two series of observations.\r\nBird, somewhat later[121\\7] (about 1750), divided several Quadrants\r\nfor public observatories. His method of dividing was considered so\r\nperfect, that the knowledge of it was purchased by the English\r\ngovernment, and published in 1767. Ramsden was equally celebrated.\r\nThe error of one of his best Quadrants (that at Padua) is said to be\r\nnever greater than two seconds. But at a later period, Ramsden\r\nconstructed Mural Circles only, holding this to be a kind of\r\ninstrument far superior to the quadrant. He made one of five feet\r\ndiameter, in 1788, for M. Piazzi at Palermo; and one of eight feet\r\nfor the observatory of Dublin. Troughton, a worthy successor of the\r\n{472} artists we have mentioned, has invented a method of dividing\r\nthe circle still superior to the former ones; indeed, one which is\r\ntheoretically perfect, and practically capable of consummate\r\naccuracy. In this way, circles have been constructed for Greenwich,\r\nArmagh, Cambridge, and many other places; and probably this method,\r\ncarefully applied, offers to the astronomer as much exactness as his\r\nother implements allow him to receive; but the slightest casualty\r\nhappening to such an instrument, after it has been constructed, or\r\nany doubt whether the method of graduation has been rightly applied,\r\nmakes it unfit for the jealous scrupulosity of modern astronomy.\r\n\r\n[Note 121\\7: Mont. iv. 337.]\r\n\r\nThe English artists sought to attain accurate measurements by\r\ncontinued bisection and other aliquot subdivision of the limb of\r\ntheir circle; but Mayer proposed to obtain this end otherwise, by\r\n_repeating_ the measure on different parts of the circumference till\r\nthe error of the division becomes unimportant, instead of attempting\r\nto divide an instrument without error. This invention of the\r\nRepeating Circle was zealously adopted by the French, and the\r\nrelative superiority of the rival methods is still a matter of\r\ndifference of opinion.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [In the series of these great astronomical mechanists, we\r\nmust also reckon George Reichenbach. He was born Aug. 24, 1772, at\r\nDurlach; became Lieutenant of Artillery in the Bavarian service in\r\n1794; (Salinenrath) Commissioner of Salt-works in 1811; and in 1820,\r\nFirst Commissioner of Water-works and Roads. He became, with\r\nFraunhofer, the ornament of the mechanical and optical Institute\r\nerected in 1805 at Benedictbeuern by Utzschneider; and his\r\nastronomical instruments, meridian circles, transit instruments,\r\nequatorials, heliometers, make an epoch in Observing Astronomy. His\r\ncontrivances in the Salt-works at Berchtesgaden and Reichenhall, in\r\nthe Arms Manufactory at Amberg, and in the works for boring cannon\r\nat Vienna, are enduring monuments of his rare mechanical talent. He\r\ndied May 21, 1826, at Munich.]\r\n\r\n2. _Clocks._--The improvements in the measures of space require\r\ncorresponding improvements in the measure of time. The beginning of\r\nany thing which we can call accuracy, in this subject, was the\r\napplication of the Pendulum to clocks, by Huyghens, in 1656. That\r\nthe successive oscillations of a pendulum occupy equal times, had\r\nbeen noticed by Galileo; but in order to take advantage of this\r\nproperty, the pendulum must be connected with machinery by which its\r\nmotion is kept from languishing, and by which the number of its\r\nswings is recorded. By inventing such machinery, Huyghens at once\r\nobtained {473} a measure of time more accurate than the sun itself.\r\nHence astronomers were soon led to obtain the right ascension of a\r\nstar, not directly, by measuring a Distance in the heavens, but\r\nindirectly, by observing the Moment of its Transit. This observation\r\nis now made with a degree of accuracy which might, at first sight,\r\nappear beyond the limits of human sense, being noted to a _tenth of\r\na second of time_: but we may explain this, by remarking that though\r\nthe number of the second at which the transit happens is given by\r\nthe clock, and is reckoned according to the course of time, the\r\nsubdivision of the second of time into smaller fractions is\r\nperformed by the eye,--by seeing the space described by the heavenly\r\nbody in a whole second, and hence estimating a smaller time,\r\naccording to the space which its description occupies.\r\n\r\nBut in order to make clocks so accurate as to justify this degree of\r\nprecision, their construction was improved by various persons in\r\nsuccession. Picard soon found that Huyghens' clocks were affected in\r\ntheir going by temperature, for heat caused expansion of the\r\nmetallic pendulum. This cause of error was remedied by combining\r\ndifferent metals, as iron and copper, which expand in a different\r\ndegree, in such a way that their effects compensate each other.\r\nGraham afterwards used quicksilver for the same purpose. The\r\n_Escapement_ too (which connects the force which impels the clock\r\nwith the pendulum which regulates it), and other parts of the\r\nmachinery, had the most refined mechanical skill and ingenuity of\r\nthe best artists constantly bestowed upon then. The astronomer of\r\nthe present day, constantly testing the going of such a clock by the\r\nmotions of the fixed stars, has a scale of time as stable and as\r\nminutely exact as the scales on which he measures distance.\r\n\r\nThe construction of good Watches, that is, portable or marine\r\nclocks, was important on another account, namely, because they might\r\nbe used in determining the longitude of places. Hence the\r\nimprovement of this little machine became an object of national\r\ninterest, and was included in the reward of 20,000_l._, which we\r\nhave already noticed as offered by the English parliament for the\r\ndiscovery of the longitude. Harrison,[122\\7] originally a carpenter,\r\nturned his mind to this subject with success. After thirty years of\r\nlabor, in which he was encouraged by many eminent persons, he\r\nproduced, in 1758, a time-keeper, which was sent on a voyage to\r\nJamaica for trial. After 161 days, the error {474} of the watch was\r\nonly one minute five seconds, and the artist received from the\r\nnation 5000_l._ At a later period,[123\\7] at the age of seventy-five\r\nyears, after a life devoted to this object, having still further\r\nsatisfied the commissioners, he received, in 1765, 10,000_l._, at\r\nthe same time that Euler and the heirs of Mayer received each\r\n3000_l._ for the lunar tables which they had constructed.\r\n\r\n[Note 122\\7: Mont. iv. 554.]\r\n\r\n[Note 123\\7: Mont. iv. 560.]\r\n\r\nThe two methods of finding the longitude, by Chronometers and by\r\nLunar Observations, have solved the problem for all practical\r\npurposes; but the latter could not have been employed at sea without\r\nthe aid of that invaluable instrument, the Sextant, in which the\r\ndistance of two objects is observed, by bringing one to coincide\r\napparently with the reflected image of the other. This instrument\r\nwas invented by Hadley, in 1731. Though the problem of finding the\r\nlongitude be, in fact, one of geography rather than astronomy, it is\r\nan application of astronomical science which has so materially\r\naffected the progress of our knowledge, that it deserves the notice\r\nwe have bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\n3. _Telescopes._--We have spoken of the application of the telescope\r\nto astronomical measurements, but not of the improvement of the\r\ntelescope itself. If we endeavor to augment the optical power of\r\nthis instrument, we run, according to the path we take, into various\r\ninconveniences;--distortion, confusion, want of light, or colored\r\nimages. Distortion and confusion are produced, if we increase the\r\nmagnifying power, retaining the length and the aperture of the\r\nobject-glass. If we diminish the aperture we suffer from loss of\r\nlight. What remains then is to increase the focal length. This was\r\ndone to an extraordinary extent, in telescopes constructed in the\r\nbeginning of the last century. Huyghens, in his first attempts, made\r\nthem 22 feet long;[124\\7] afterwards, Campani, by order of Louis the\r\nFourteenth, made them of 86, 100, and 136 feet. Huyghens, by new\r\nexertions, made a telescope 210 feet long. Auzout and Hartsoecker\r\nare said to have gone much further, and to have succeeded in making\r\nan object-glass of 600 feet focus. But even such telescopes as those\r\nof Campani are almost unmanageable: in that of Huyghens, the\r\nobject-glass was placed on a pole, and the observer was placed at\r\nthe focus with an eye-glass.\r\n\r\n[Note 124\\7: Bailly, ii. 253.]\r\n\r\nThe most serious objection to the increase of the aperture of\r\nobject-glasses, was the coloration of the image produced, in\r\nconsequence of the unequal refrangibility of differently colored\r\nrays. Newton, who discovered the principle of this defect in lenses,\r\nhad maintained that {475} the evil was irremediable, and that a\r\ncompound lens could no more refract without producing color, than a\r\nsingle lens could. Euler and Klingenstierna doubted the exactness of\r\nNewton's proposition; and, in 1755, Dollond disproved it by\r\nexperiment. This discovery pointed out a method of making\r\nobject-glasses which should give no color;--which should be\r\n_achromatic_. For this purpose Dollond fabricated various kinds of\r\nglass (flint and crown glass); and Clairaut and D'Alembert\r\ncalculated formulæ. Dollond and his son[125\\7] succeeded in\r\nconstructing telescopes of three feet long (with a triple\r\nobject-glass) which produced an effect as great as those of\r\nforty-five feet on the ancient principles. At first it was conceived\r\nthat these discoveries opened the way to a vast extension of the\r\nastronomer's power of vision; but it was found that the most\r\nmaterial improvement was the compendious size of the new\r\ninstruments; for, in increasing the dimensions, the optician was\r\nstopped by the impossibility of obtaining lenses of flint-glass of\r\nvery large dimensions. And this branch of art remained long\r\nstationary; but, after a time, its epoch of advance again arrived.\r\nIn the present century, Fraunhofer, at Munich, with the help of\r\nGuinand and the pecuniary support of Utzschneider, succeeded in\r\nforming lenses of flint-glass of a magnitude till then unheard of.\r\nAchromatic object-glasses, of a foot in diameter, and twenty feet\r\nfocal length, are now no longer impossible; although in such\r\nattempts the artist cannot reckon on certain success.\r\n\r\n[Note 125\\7: Bailly, iii. 118.]\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [Joseph Fraunhofer was born March 6, 1787, at Straubing in\r\nBavaria, the son of a poor glazier. He was in his earlier years\r\nemployed in his father's trade, so that he was not able to attend\r\nschool, and remained ignorant of writing and arithmetic till his\r\nfourteenth year. At a later period he was assisted by Utzschneider,\r\nand tried rapidly to recover his lost ground. In the year 1806 he\r\nentered the establishment of Utzschneider as an optician. In this\r\nestablishment (transferred from Benedictbeuern to Munich in 1819) he\r\nsoon came to be the greatest Optician of Germany. His excellent\r\ntelescopes and microscopes are known throughout Europe. His greatest\r\ntelescope, that in the Observatory at Dorpat, has an object-glass of\r\n9 inches diameter, and a focal length of 13⅓ feet. His written\r\nproductions are to be found in the _Memoirs_ of the Bavarian\r\nAcademy, in Gilbert's _Annalen der Physik_, and in Schumacher's\r\n_Astronomische Nachrichten_. He died the 7th of June, 1826.] {476}\r\n\r\nSuch telescopes might be expected to add something to our knowledge\r\nof the heavens, if they had not been anticipated by reflectors of an\r\nequal or greater scale. James Gregory had invented, and Newton had\r\nmore efficaciously introduced, reflecting telescopes. But these were\r\nnot used with any peculiar effect, till the elder Herschel made them\r\nhis especial study. His skill and perseverance in grinding specula,\r\nand in contriving the best apparatus for their use, were rewarded by\r\na number of curious and striking discoveries, among which, as we\r\nhave already related, was the discovery of a new planet beyond\r\nSaturn. In 1789, Herschel surpassed all his former attempts, by\r\nbringing into action a reflecting telescope of forty feet length,\r\nwith a speculum of four feet in diameter. The first application of\r\nthis magnificent instrument showed a new satellite (the sixth) of\r\nSaturn. He and his son have, with reflectors of twenty feet, made a\r\ncomplete survey of the heavens, so far as they are visible in this\r\ncountry; and the latter is now in a distant region completing this\r\nsurvey, by adding to it the other hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the improvements of telescopes we ought to notice,\r\nthat they have been pursued in the eye-glasses as well as in the\r\nobject-glasses. Instead of the single lens, Huyghens substituted an\r\neye-piece of two lenses, which, though introduced for another\r\npurpose, attained the object of destroying color.[126\\7] Ramsden's\r\neye-piece is one fit to be used with a micrometer, and others of\r\nmore complex construction have been used for various purposes.\r\n\r\n[Note 126\\7: Coddington's _Optics_, ii. 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Observatories._\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY, which is thus benefited by the erection of large and\r\nstable instruments, requires also the establishment of permanent\r\nObservatories, supplied with funds for their support, and for that\r\nof the observers. Such observatories have existed at all periods of\r\nthe history of the science; but from the commencement of the period\r\nwhich we are now reviewing, they multiplied to such an extent that\r\nwe cannot even enumerate them. Yet we must undoubtedly look upon\r\nsuch establishments, and the labors of which they have been the\r\nscene, as important and essential parts of the history of the\r\nprogress of astronomy. Some of the most distinguished of the\r\nobservatories of modern times we may mention. The first of these\r\nwere that of Tycho Brahe {477} at Uraniburg, and that of the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse Cassel, at Cassel, where Rothman and Byrgius\r\nobserved. But by far the most important observations, at least since\r\nthose of Tycho, which were the basis of the discoveries of Kepler\r\nand Newton, have been made at Paris and Greenwich. The Observatory\r\nof Paris was built in 1667. It was there that the first Cassini made\r\nmany of his discoveries; three of his descendants have since labored\r\nin the same place, and two others of his family, the\r\nMaraldis;[127\\7] besides many other eminent astronomers, as Picard,\r\nLa Hire, Lefêvre, Fouchy, Legentil, Chappe, Méchain, Bouvard.\r\nGreenwich Observatory was built a few years later (1675); and ever\r\nsince its erection, the observations there made have been the\r\nfoundation of the greatest improvements which astronomy, for the\r\ntime, received. Flamsteed, Halley, Bradley, Bliss, Maskelyne, Pond,\r\nhave occupied the place in succession: on the retirement of the\r\nlast-named astronomer in 1835, Professor Airy was removed thither\r\nfrom the Cambridge Observatory. In every state, and in almost every\r\nprincipality in Europe, Observatories have been established; but\r\nthese have often fallen speedily into inaction, or have contributed\r\nlittle to the progress of astronomy, because their observations have\r\nnot been published. From the same causes, the numerous private\r\nobservatories which exist throughout Europe have added little to our\r\nknowledge, except where the attention of the astronomer has been\r\ndirected to some definite points; as, for instance, the magnificent\r\nlabors of the Herschels, or the skilful observations made by Mr.\r\nPond with the Westbury circle, which first pointed out the error of\r\ngraduation of the Greenwich quadrants. The Observations, now\r\nregularly published,[128\\7] are those of Greenwich, begun by\r\nMaskelyne, and continued quarterly by Mr. Pond; those of Königsberg,\r\npublished by Bessel since 1814; of Vienna, by Littrow since 1820; of\r\nSpeier, by Schwerd since 1826; those of Cambridge, commenced by Airy\r\nin 1828; of Armagh, by Robinson in 1829. Besides these, a number of\r\nuseful observations have been published in journals and occasional\r\nforms; as, for instance, those of Zach, made by Seeberg, near Gotha,\r\nsince 1788; and others have been employed in forming catalogues, of\r\nwhich we shall speak shortly.\r\n\r\n[Note 127\\7: Mont. iv. 346.]\r\n\r\n[Note 128\\7: Airy, _Rep._ p. 128.]\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [I have left the statement of published Observations in the\r\ntext as it stood originally. I believe that at present (1847) the\r\ntwelve places contained in the following list publish their\r\nObservations quite regularly, or nearly so;--Greenwich, Oxford,\r\nCambridge, Vienna, {478} Berlin, Dorpat, Munich, Geneva, Paris,\r\nKönigsberg, Madras, the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nLittrow, in his translation, adds to the publications noticed in the\r\ntext as containing astronomical Observations, Zach's _Monatliche\r\nCorrespondenz_, Lindenau and Bohnenberger's _Zeitschrift für\r\nAstronomie_, Bode's _Astronomisches Jahrbuch_, Schumacher's\r\n_Astronomische Nachrichten_.]\r\n\r\nNor has the establishment of observatories been confined to Europe.\r\nIn 1786, M. de Beauchamp, at the expense of Louis the Sixteenth,\r\nerected an observatory at Bagdad, \"built to restore the Chaldean and\r\nArabian observations,\" as the inscription stated; but, probably, the\r\nrestoration once effected, the main intention had been fulfilled,\r\nand little perseverance in observing was thought necessary. In 1828,\r\nthe British government completed the building of an observatory at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, which Lacaille had already made an\r\nastronomical station by his observations there at an earlier period\r\n(1750); and an observatory formed in New South Wales by Sir T. M.\r\nBrisbane in 1822, and presented by him to the government, is also in\r\nactivity. The East India Company has founded observatories at\r\nMadras, Bombay, and St. Helena; and observations made at the former\r\nof these places, and at St. Helena, have been published.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the work done at such observatories upon the past\r\nprogress of astronomy, has already been seen in the preceding\r\nnarrative. Their bearing upon the present condition of the science\r\nwill be the subject of a few remarks hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Scientific Societies._\r\n\r\nTHE influence of Scientific Societies, or Academical Bodies, has\r\nalso been very powerful in the subject before us. In all branches of\r\nknowledge, the use of such associations of studious and inquiring\r\nmen is great; the clearness and coherence of a speculator's ideas,\r\nand their agreement with facts (the two main conditions of\r\nscientific truth), are severally but beneficially tested by\r\ncollision with other minds. In astronomy, moreover, the vast extent\r\nof the subject makes requisite the division of labor and the support\r\nof sympathy. The Royal Societies of London and of Paris were founded\r\nnearly at the same time as the metropolitan Observatories of the two\r\ncountries. We have seen what constellations of philosophers, and\r\nwhat activity of research, existed at those periods; these\r\nphilosophers appear in the lists, their discoveries {479} in the\r\npublications, of the above-mentioned eminent Societies. As the\r\nprogress of physical science, and principally of astronomy,\r\nattracted more and more admiration, Academies were created in other\r\ncountries. That of Berlin was founded by Leibnitz in 1710; that of\r\nSt Petersburg was established by Peter the Great in 1725; and both\r\nthese have produced highly valuable Memoirs. In more modern times\r\nthese associations have multiplied almost beyond the power of\r\nestimation. They have been formed according to divisions, both of\r\nlocality and of subject, conformable to the present extent of\r\nscience, and the vast population of its cultivators. It would be\r\nuseless to attempt to give a view either of their number or of the\r\nenormous mass of scientific literature which their Transactions\r\npresent. But we may notice, as especially connected with our present\r\nsubject, the Astronomical Society of London, founded in 1820, which\r\ngave a strong impulse to the pursuit of the science in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Patrons of Astronomy._\r\n\r\nThe advantages which letters and philosophy derive from the\r\npatronage of the great have sometimes been questioned; that love of\r\nknowledge, it has been thought, cannot be genuine which requires\r\nsuch stimulation, nor those speculations free and true which are\r\nthus forced into being. In the sciences of observation and\r\ncalculation, however, in which disputed questions can be\r\nexperimentally decided, and in which opinions are not disturbed by\r\nmen's practical principles and interests, there is nothing\r\nnecessarily operating to poison or neutralize the resources which\r\nwealth and power supply to the investigation of truth.\r\n\r\nAstronomy has, in all ages, flourished under the favor of the rich and\r\npowerful; in the period of which we speak, this was eminently the\r\ncase. Louis the Fourteenth gave to the astronomy of France a\r\ndistinction which, without him, it could not have attained. No step\r\nperhaps tended more to this than his bringing the celebrated Dominic\r\nCassini to Paris. This Italian astronomer (for he was born at\r\nPermaldo, in the county of Nice, and was professor at Bologna), was\r\nalready in possession of a brilliant reputation, when the French\r\nambassador, in the name of his sovereign, applied to Pope Clement the\r\nNinth, and to the senate of Bologna, that he should be allowed to\r\nremove to Paris. The request was granted only so far as an absence of\r\nsix years; but at the end of that time, the benefits and honors which\r\n{480} the king had conferred upon him, fixed him in France. The\r\nimpulse which his arrival (in 1669) and his residence gave to\r\nastronomy, showed the wisdom of the measure. In the same spirit, the\r\nFrench government drew to Paris Römer from Denmark, Huyghens from\r\nHolland, and gave a pension to Hevelius, and a large sum when his\r\nobservatory at Dantzic had been destroyed by fire in 1679.\r\n\r\nWhen the sovereigns of Prussia and Russia were exerting themselves to\r\nencourage the sciences in their countries, they followed the same\r\ncourse which had been so successful in France. Thus, as we have said,\r\nthe Czar Peter took Delisle to Petersburg in 1725; the celebrated\r\nFrederick the Great drew to Berlin, Voltaire and Maupertuis, Euler and\r\nLagrange; and the Empress Catharine obtained in the same way Euler,\r\ntwo of the Bernoulli's, and other mathematicians. In none of these\r\ninstances, however, did it happen that \"the generous plant did still\r\nits stock renew,\" as we have seen was the case at Paris, with the\r\nCassinis, and their kinsmen the Maraldis.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [I may notice among instances of the patronage of\r\nAstronomy, the reward at present offered by the King of Denmark for\r\nthe discovery of a Comet.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to mention here the more recent cases in which\r\nsovereigns or statesmen have attempted to patronize individual\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Astronomical Expeditions._\r\n\r\nBESIDES the pensions thus bestowed upon resident mathematicians and\r\nastronomers, the governments of Europe have wisely and usefully\r\nemployed considerable sums upon expeditions and travels undertaken\r\nby men of science for some appropriate object. Thus Picard, in 1671,\r\nwas sent to Uraniburg, the scene of Tycho's observations, to\r\ndetermine its latitude and its longitude. He found that \"the City of\r\nthe Skies\" had utterly disappeared from the earth; and even its\r\nfoundations were retraced with difficulty. With the same object,\r\nthat of accurately connecting the labors of the places which had\r\nbeen at different periods the metropolis of astronomy, Chazelles was\r\nsent, in 1693, to Alexandria. We have already mentioned Richer's\r\nastronomical expedition to Cayenne in 1672. Varin and\r\nDeshayes[129\\7] were sent a few years later into the same regions\r\nfor similar purposes. Halley's expedition to St. {481} Helena in\r\n1677, with the view of observing the southern stars, was at his own\r\nexpense; but at a later period (in 1698), he was appointed to the\r\ncommand of a small vessel by King William the Third, in order that\r\nhe might make his magnetical observations in all parts of the world.\r\nLacaille was maintained by the French government four years at the\r\nCape of Good Hope (1750-4), for the purpose of observing the stars\r\nof the southern hemisphere. The two transits of Venus in 1761 and\r\n1769, occasioned expeditions to be sent to Kamtschatka and Tobolsk\r\nby the Russians; to the Isle of France, and to Coromandel, by the\r\nFrench;[130\\7] to the isles of St. Helena and Otaheite by the\r\nEnglish; to Lapland and to Drontheim, by the Swedes and Danes. I\r\nshall not here refer to the measures of degrees executed by various\r\nnations, still less the innumerable surveys by land and sea; but I\r\nmay just notice the successive English expeditions of Captains Basil\r\nHall, Sabine, and Foster, for the purpose of determining the length\r\nof the seconds' pendulum in different latitudes; and the voyages of\r\nM. Biot and others, sent by the French government for the same\r\npurpose. Much has been done in this way, but not more than the\r\nprogress of astronomy absolutely required; and only a small portion\r\nof that which the completion of the subject calls for.\r\n\r\n[Note 129\\7: Bailly, ii. 374.]\r\n\r\n[Note 130\\7: Bailly, iii. 107.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_Present State of Astronomy._\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY, in its present condition, is not only much the most\r\nadvanced of the sciences, but is also in far more favorable\r\ncircumstances than any other science for making any future advance, as\r\nsoon as this is possible. The general methods and conditions by which\r\nsuch an advantage is to be obtained for the various sciences, we shall\r\nendeavor hereafter to throw some light upon; but in the mean time, we\r\nmay notice here some of the circumstances in which this peculiar\r\nfelicity of the present state of astronomy may be traced.\r\n\r\nThe science is cultivated by a number of votaries, with an assiduity\r\nand labor, and with an expenditure of private and public resources,\r\nto which no other subject approaches; and the mode of its\r\ncultivation in all public and most private observatories, has this\r\ncharacter--that it forms, at the same time, a constant process of\r\nverification of existing discoveries, and a strict search for any\r\nnew discoverable laws. The observations made are immediately\r\nreferred to the best tables, and {482} corrected by the best formulæ\r\nwhich are known; and if the result of such a reduction leaves any\r\nthing unaccounted for, the astronomer is forthwith curious and\r\nanxious to trace this deviation from the expected numbers to its\r\nrule and its origin; and till the first, at least, of these things\r\nis performed, he is dissatisfied and unquiet. The reference of\r\nobservations to the state of the heavens as known by previous\r\nresearches, implies a great amount of calculation. The exact places\r\nof the stars at some standard period are recorded in _Catalogues_;\r\ntheir movements, according to the laws hitherto detected, are\r\narranged in _Tables_; and if these tables are applied to predict the\r\nnumbers which observation on each day ought to give, they form\r\n_Ephemerides_. Thus the catalogues of fixed stars of Flamsteed, of\r\nPiazzi, of Maskelyne, of the Astronomical Society, are the basis of\r\nall observation. To these are applied the Corrections for Refraction\r\nof Bradley or Bessel, and those for Aberration, for Nutation, for\r\nPrecession, of the best modern astronomers. The observations so\r\ncorrected enable the observer to satisfy himself of the delicacy and\r\nfidelity of his measures of time and space; his Clocks and his Arcs.\r\nBut this being done, different stars so observed can be compared\r\nwith each other, and the astronomer can then endeavor further to\r\ncorrect his fundamental Elements;--his Catalogue, or his Tables of\r\nCorrections. In these Tables, though previous discovery has\r\nascertained the law, yet the exact quantity, the _constant_ or\r\n_coefficient_ of the formula, can be exactly fixed only by numerous\r\nobservations and comparisons. This is a labor which is still going\r\non, and in which there are differences of opinion on almost every\r\npoint; but the amount of these differences is the strongest evidence\r\nof the certainty and exactness of those doctrines in which all\r\nagree. Thus Lindenau makes the coefficient of Nutation rather less\r\nthan nine seconds, which other astronomers give as about nine\r\nseconds and three-tenths. The Tables of Refraction are still the\r\nsubject of much discussion, and of many attempts at improvement. And\r\nafter or amid these discussions, arise questions whether there be\r\nnot other corrections of which the law has not yet been assigned.\r\nThe most remarkable example of such questions is the controversy\r\nconcerning the existence of an Annual Parallax of the fixed stars,\r\nwhich Brinkley asserted, and which Pond denied. Such a dispute\r\nbetween two of the best modern observers, only proves that the\r\nquantity in question, if it really exist, is of the same order as\r\nthe hitherto unsurmounted errors of instruments and corrections.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [The belief in an appreciable parallax of some of the fixed\r\n{483} stars appears to gain ground among astronomers. The parallax\r\nof 61 _Cygni_, as determined by Bessel, is 0\"·34; about one-third of\r\na second, or 1⁄10000 of a degree. That of _α Centauri_, as\r\ndetermined by Maclear, is 0\"·9, or 1⁄4000 of a degree.]\r\n\r\nBut besides the fixed stars and their corrections, the astronomer\r\nhas the motions of the planets for his field of action. The\r\nestablished theories have given us tables of these, from which their\r\ndaily places are calculated and given in our Ephemerides, as the\r\n_Berliner Jahrbuch_ of Encke, or the _Nautical Almanac_, published\r\nby the government of this country, the _Connaissance des Tems_ which\r\nappears at Paris, or the _Effemeridi di Milano_. The comparison of\r\nthe observed with the tabular place, gives us the means of\r\ncorrecting the coefficients of the tables; and thus of obtaining\r\ngreater exactness in the constants of the solar system. But these\r\nconstants depend upon the mass and form of the bodies of which the\r\nsystem is composed; and in this province, as well as in sidereal\r\nastronomy, different determinations, obtained by different paths,\r\nmay be compared; and doubts may be raised and may be solved. In this\r\nway, the perturbations produced by Jupiter on different planets gave\r\nrise to a doubt whether his attraction be really proportional to his\r\nmass, as the law of universal gravitation asserts. The doubt has\r\nbeen solved by Nicolai and Encke in Germany, and by Airy in England.\r\nThe mass of Jupiter, as shown by the perturbations of Juno, of\r\nVesta, and of Encke's Comet, and by the motion of his outermost\r\nSatellite, is found to agree, though different from the mass\r\npreviously received on the authority of Laplace. Thus also\r\nBurckhardt, Littrow, and Airy, have corrected the elements of the\r\nSolar Tables. In other cases, the astronomer finds that no change of\r\nthe coefficients will bring the Tables and the observations to a\r\ncoincidence;--that a new term in the formula is wanting. He obtains,\r\nas far as he can, the law of this unknown term; if possible, he\r\ntraces it to some known or probable cause. Thus Mr. Airy, in his\r\nexamination of the Solar Tables, not only found that a diminution of\r\nthe received mass of Mars was necessary, but perceived discordances\r\nwhich led him to suspect the existence of a new inequality. Such an\r\ninequality was at length found to result theoretically from the\r\nattraction of Venus. Encke, in his examination of his comet, found a\r\ndiminution of the periodic time in the successive revolutions; from\r\nwhich he inferred the existence of a resisting medium. Uranus still\r\ndeviates from his tabular place, and the cause remains yet to be\r\ndiscovered. (But see the _Additions_ to this volume.) {484}\r\n\r\nThus it is impossible that an assertion, false to any amount which\r\nthe existing state of observation can easily detect, should have any\r\nabiding prevalence in astronomy. Such errors may long keep their\r\nground in any science which is contained mainly in didactic works,\r\nand studied in the closet, but not acted upon elsewhere;--which is\r\nreasoned upon much, but brought to the test of experiment rarely or\r\nnever. Here, on the contrary, an error, if it arise, makes its way\r\ninto the Tables, into the Ephemeris, into the observer's nightly\r\nList, or his sheet of Reductions; the evidence of sense flies in its\r\nface in a thousand observatories; the discrepancy is traced to its\r\nsource, and soon disappears forever.\r\n\r\nIn this favored branch of knowledge, the most recondite and delicate\r\ndiscoveries can no more suffer doubt or contradiction, than the most\r\npalpable facts of sense which the face of nature offers to our\r\nnotice. The last great discovery in astronomy--the motion of the\r\nstars arising from Aberration--is as obvious to the vast population\r\nof astronomical observers in all parts of the world, as the motion\r\nof the stars about the pole is to the casual night wanderer. And\r\nthis immunity from the danger of any large error in the received\r\ndoctrines, is a firm platform on which the astronomer can stand and\r\nexert himself to reach perpetually further and further into the\r\nregion of the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe same scrupulous care and diligence in recording all that has\r\nhitherto been ascertained, has been extended to those departments of\r\nastronomy in which we have as yet no general principles which serve\r\nto bind together our acquired treasures. These records may be\r\nconsidered as constituting a _Descriptive Astronomy_; such are, for\r\ninstance, Catalogues of Stars, and Maps of the Heavens, Maps of the\r\nMoon, representations of the appearance of the Sun and Planets as\r\nseen through powerful telescopes, pictures of Nebulæ, of Comets, and\r\nthe like. Thus, besides the Catalogue of Fundamental Stars which may\r\nbe considered as standard points of reference for all observations\r\nof the Sun, Moon, and Planets, there exist many large catalogues of\r\nsmaller stars. Flamsteed's _Historia Celestis_, which much surpassed\r\nany previous catalogue, contained above 3000 stars. But in 1801, the\r\nFrench _Histoire Céleste_ appeared, comprising observations of\r\n50,000 stars. Catalogues or charts of other special portions of the\r\nsky have been published more recently; and in 1825, the Berlin\r\nAcademy proposed to the astronomers of Europe to carry on this work\r\nby portioning out the heavens among them.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [Before Flamsteed, the best Catalogue of the Stars was\r\n{485} Tycho Brahe's, containing the places of about 1000 stars,\r\ndetermined very roughly with the naked eye. On the occasion of a\r\nproject of finding the longitude, which was offered to Charles II.,\r\nin 1674, Flamsteed represented that the method was quite useless, in\r\nconsequence, among other things, of the inaccuracy of Tycho's places\r\nof the stars. Flamsteed's letters being shown King Charles, he was\r\nstartled at the assertion of the fixed stars' places being false in\r\nthe Catalogue, and said, with some vehemence, \"He must have them\r\nanew observed, examined, and corrected for the use of his seamen.\"\r\nThis was the immediate occasion of building Greenwich Observatory,\r\nand placing Flamsteed there as an observer. Flamsteed's _Historia\r\nCelestis_ contained above 3000 stars, observed with telescopic\r\nsights. It has recently been republished with important improvements\r\nby Mr. Baily. See Baily's _Flamsteed_, p. 38.\r\n\r\nThe French _Histoire Céleste_ was published in 1801 by Lalande,\r\ncontaining 50,000 stars, simply as observed by himself and other\r\nFrench astronomers. The reduction of the observations contained in\r\nthis Catalogue to the mean places at the beginning of the year 1800\r\nmay be effected by means of Tables published by Schumacher for that\r\npurpose in 1825.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, Piazzi's Catalogue of 6748 stars, founded on Maskelyne's\r\nCatalogue of 1700, was published; afterwards extended to 7646 stars\r\nin 1814. This is considered as the greatest work undertaken by any\r\nmodern astronomer; the observations being well made, reduced, and\r\ncompared with those of former astronomers. Piazzi's Catalogue is the\r\nstandard and accurate Catalogue, as the _Histoire Céleste_ is the\r\nstandard approximate Catalogue for small stars. But the new planets\r\nwere discovered mostly by a comparison of the heavens with Bode's\r\n(Berlin) Catalogue.\r\n\r\nI may mention other Catalogues of Stars which have recently been\r\npublished. Pond's Catalogue contains 1112 Northern stars; Johnson's,\r\n606; Wrottesley's, 1318 (in Right Ascension only); Airy's First\r\nCambridge Catalogue, 726; his Greenwich Catalogue, 1439. Pearson's\r\nhas 520 zodiacal stars; Groombridge's, 4243 circumpolar stars as far\r\nas 50 degrees of North Polar distance; Santini's, a zone 18 degrees\r\nNorth of the equator. Besides these, Mr. Taylor has published, by\r\norder of the Madras government, a Catalogue of 11,000 stars observed\r\nby him at Madras; and Rumker, who observed in the Observatory\r\nestablished by Sir Thomas Brisbane at Paramatta (in Australia), has\r\ncommenced a Catalogue which is to contain 12,000. Mr. Baily {486}\r\npublished two Standard Catalogues; that of the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety, containing 2881 stars; and that of the British Association,\r\ncontaining 8377 stars. I omit other Catalogues, as those of\r\nArgelander, &c., and Catalogues of Southern Stars.\r\n\r\nOf the Berlin Maps, fourteen hours in Right Ascension have been\r\npublished; and their value may be judged of by this circumstance, that\r\nit was in a great measure by comparing the heavens with these Maps\r\nthat the new planet Astræa was discovered. The Zone observations made\r\nat Königsberg, by the late illustrious astronomer Bessel, deserve to\r\nbe mentioned, as embracing a vast number of stars.\r\n\r\nThe common mode of _designating the Stars_ is founded upon the\r\nancient constellations as given by Ptolemy; to which Bayer, of\r\nAugsburg, in his _Uranometria_, added the artifice of designating\r\nthe brightest stars in each constellation by the Greek letters, α,\r\nβ, γ, &c., applied in order of brightness, and when these were\r\nexhausted, the Latin letters. Flamsteed used numbers. As the number\r\nof observed stars increased, various methods were employed for\r\ndesignating them; and the confusion which has been thus introduced,\r\nboth with regard to the boundaries of the constellations and the\r\nnomenclature of the stars in each, has been much complained of\r\nlately. Some attempts have been made to remedy this variety and\r\ndisorder. Mr. Argelander has recently recorded stars, according to\r\ntheir magnitudes as seen by the naked eye, in a _Neue Uranometrie_.\r\n\r\nAmong representations of the Moon I may mention Hevelius's\r\n_Selenographia_, a work of former times, and Beer and Madler's Map\r\nof the Moon, recently published.]\r\n\r\nI have already said something of the observations of the two\r\nHerschels on _Double Stars_, which have led to a knowledge of the\r\nlaw of the revolution of such systems. But besides these, the same\r\nillustrious astronomers have accumulated enormous treasures of\r\nobservations of _Nebulæ_; the materials, it may be, hereafter, of\r\nsome vast new generalization with respect to the history of the\r\nsystem of the universe.\r\n\r\n[2d Ed.] [A few measures of Double Stars are to be found in previous\r\nastronomical records. But the epoch of the creation of this part of\r\nthe science of astronomy must be placed at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, when Sir William Herschel (in 1802) published in\r\nthe _Phil. Trans._ a Catalogue of 500 new Nebulæ of various classes,\r\nand in the _Phil. Trans._ 1803, a paper \"On the changes in the\r\nrelative situation of the Double Stars in 25 years.\" In succeeding\r\npapers he pursued the subject. In one in 1814 he noticed the\r\nbreaking up of the {487} Milky Way in different places, apparently\r\nfrom some principle of Attraction; and in this, and in one in 1817,\r\nhe published those remarkable views on the distribution of the stars\r\nin our own cluster as forming a large stratum, and on the connection\r\nof stars and nebulæ (the stars appearing sometimes to be accompanied\r\nby nebulæ, sometimes to have absorbed a part of the nebula, and\r\nsometimes to have been formed from nebulæ), which have been accepted\r\nand propounded by others as the _Nebular Theory_. Sir William\r\nHerschel's last paper was a Catalogue of 145 new Double Stars\r\ncommunicated to the Astronomical Society in 1822. In 1827 M. Struve,\r\nof Dorpat (in Russia), published his _Catalogus Novus_, containing\r\nthe places of 3112 double stars. While this was going on, Sir John\r\nHerschel and Sir James South published (in the _Phil. Trans._ 1824)\r\naccurate measures of 380 Double and Triple Stars, to which Sir J.\r\nSouth afterwards added 458. Mr. Dunlop published measures of 253\r\nSouthern Double Stars. Other Observations have been published by\r\nCapt. Smyth, Mr. Dawes, &c. The great work of Struve, _Mensuræ\r\nMicrometricæ_, &c., contains 3134 such objects, including most of\r\nSir W. Herschel's Double Stars. Sir J. Herschel in 1826, 7, and 8\r\npresented to the Astronomical Society about 1000 measures of Double\r\nStars; and in 1830, good measures of 1236, made with his 20-feet\r\nreflector. His paper in vol. v. of the _Ast. Soc. Mem._, besides\r\nmeasures of 364 such stars, exhibits all the most striking results,\r\nas to the motion of Double Stars, which have yet been obtained. In\r\n1835 he carried his 20-feet reflector to the Cape of Good Hope for\r\nthe purpose of completing the survey of Double Stars and Nebulæ in\r\nthe southern hemisphere with the same instruments which had explored\r\nthe northern skies. He returned from the Cape in 1838, and is now\r\n(1846) about to give the world the results of his labors. Besides\r\nthe stars just mentioned, his work will contain from 1500 to 2000\r\nadditional double stars; making a gross number of above 8000; in\r\nwhich of course are included a number of objects of no great\r\nscientific interest, but in which also are contained the materials\r\nof the most important discoveries which remain to be made by\r\nastronomers. The publication of Sir John Herschel's great work upon\r\nDouble Stars and Nebulæ is looked for with eager interest by\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\nOf the observations of Nebulæ we may say what has just been said of\r\nthe observations of Double Stars;--that they probably contain the\r\nmaterials of important future discoveries. It is impossible not to\r\nregard these phenomena with reference to the _Nebular Hypothesis_,\r\nwhich has been propounded by Laplace, and much more strongly {488}\r\ninsisted upon by other persons;--namely, the hypothesis that systems\r\nof revolving planets, of which the Solar System is an example, arise\r\nfrom the gradual contraction and separation of vast masses of\r\nnebulous matter. Yet it does not appear that any changes have been\r\nobserved in nebulæ which tend to confirm this hypothesis; and the\r\nmost powerful telescope in the world, recently erected by the Earl\r\nof Rosse, has given results which militate against the hypothesis;\r\ninasmuch as it has shown that what appeared a diffused nebulous mass\r\nis, by a greater power of vision, resolved, in all cases yet\r\nexamined, into separate stars.\r\n\r\nWhen astronomical phenomena are viewed with reference to the Nebular\r\nHypothesis, they do not belong so properly to Astronomy, in the view\r\nhere taken of it, as to Cosmogony. If such speculations should\r\nacquire any scientific value, we shall have to arrange them among\r\nthose which I have called _Palætiological_ Sciences; namely, those\r\nSciences which contemplate the universe, the earth, and its\r\ninhabitants, with reference to their historical changes and the\r\ncauses of those changes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{489}}\r\nADDITIONS TO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is a difficulty in writing for popular readers a History of the\r\nInductive Sciences, arising from this;--that the sympathy of such\r\nreaders goes most readily and naturally along the course which leads\r\nto false science and to failure. Men, in the outset of their attempts\r\nat knowledge, are prone to rush from a few hasty observations of facts\r\nto some wide and comprehensive principles; and then, to frame a system\r\non these principles. This is the opposite of the method by which the\r\nSciences have really and historically been conducted; namely, the\r\nmethod of a gradual and cautious ascent from observation to principles\r\nof limited generality, and from them to others more general. This\r\nlatter, the true Scientific Method, is _Induction_, and has led to the\r\n_Inductive Sciences_. The other, the spontaneous and delusive course,\r\nhas been termed by Francis Bacon, who first clearly pointed out the\r\ndistinction, and warned men of the error, _Anticipation_. The\r\nhopelessness of this course is the great lesson of his philosophy; but\r\nby this course proceeded all the earlier attempts of the Greek\r\nphilosophers to obtain a knowledge of the Universe.\r\n\r\nLaborious observation, narrow and modest inference, caution, slow and\r\ngradual advance, limited knowledge, are all unwelcome efforts and\r\nrestraints to the mind of man, when his speculative spirit is once\r\nroused: yet these are the necessary conditions of all advance in the\r\nInductive Sciences. Hence, as I have said, it is difficult to win the\r\nsympathy of popular readers to the true history of these sciences. The\r\ncareer of bold systems and fanciful pretences of knowledge is more\r\nentertaining and striking. Not only so, but the bold guesses and\r\nfanciful reasonings of men unchecked by doubt or fear of failure are\r\noften presented as the dictates of _Common Sense_;--as the plain,\r\nunsophisticated, unforced reason of man, acting according to no\r\nartificial rules, but following its own natural course. Such Common\r\nSense, while it {490} complacently plumes itself on its\r\nclear-sightedness in rejecting arbitrary systems of others, is no less\r\narbitrary in its own arguments, and often no less fanciful in its\r\ninventions, than those whom it condemns.\r\n\r\nWe cannot take a better representative of the Common Sense of the\r\nancient Greeks than Socrates: and we find that his Common Sense,\r\njudging with such admirable sagacity and acuteness respecting moral\r\nand practical matters, offered, when he applied it to physical\r\nquestions, examples of the unconscious assumptions and fanciful\r\nreasonings which, as we have said, Common Sense on such subjects\r\ncommonly involves.\r\n\r\nSocrates, Xenophon tells us (_Memorabilia_, iv. 7), recommended his\r\nfriends not to study astronomy, so as to pursue it into scientific\r\ndetails. This was practical advice: but he proceeded further to\r\nspeak of the palpable mistakes made by those who had carried such\r\nstudies farthest. Anaxagoras, for instance, he said, held that the\r\nSun was a Fire:--he did not consider that men can look at a fire,\r\nbut they cannot look at the Sun; they become dark by the Sun shining\r\nupon them, but not so by the fire. He did not consider that no\r\nplants can grow well except they have sunshine, but if they are\r\nexposed to the fire they are spoiled. Again, when he said that the\r\nSun was a stone red-hot, he did not consider that a stone heated by\r\nthe fire is not luminous, and soon cools, but the Sun is always\r\nluminous and always hot.\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive how a disciple of Anaxagoras would reply to\r\nthese arguments. He would say, for example, as we should probably\r\nsay at present, that if there were a mass of matter so large and so\r\nhot as Anaxagoras supposed the Sun to be, its light might be as\r\ngreat and its heat as permanent as the heat and light of the Sun\r\nare, as yet, known to be. In this case the arguments of Socrates are\r\nat any rate no better than the doctrine of Anaxagoras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{491}}\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Platonic Doctrine of Ideas._\r\n\r\nIN speaking of the Foundation of the Greek School Philosophy, I have\r\nreferred to the dialogue entitled _Parmenides_, commonly ascribed to\r\nPlato. And the doctrines ascribed to Parmenides, in that and in\r\nother works of ancient authors, are certainly remarkable examples of\r\nthe tendency which prevailed among the Greeks to rush at once to the\r\nhighest generalizations of which the human mind is capable. The\r\ndistinctive dogma of the Eleatic School, of which Parmenides was one\r\nof the most illustrious teachers, was that _All Things are One_.\r\nThis indeed was rather a doctrine of metaphysical theology than of\r\nphysical science. It tended to, or agreed with, the doctrine that\r\nAll things are God:--the doctrine commonly called _Pantheism_. But\r\nthe tenet of the Platonists which was commonly put in opposition to\r\nthis, that we must seek _The One in the Many_, had a bearing upon\r\nphysical science; at least, if we interpret it, as it is generally\r\ninterpreted, that we must seek the one Law which pervades a\r\nmultiplicity of Phenomena. We may however take the liberty of\r\nremarking, that to speak of a Rule which is exemplified in many\r\ncases, as being \"the One in the Many\" (a way of speaking by which we\r\nput out of sight the consideration what very different kinds of\r\nthings _the One_ and _the Many_ are), is a mode of expression which\r\nmakes a very simple matter look very mysterious; and is another\r\nexample of the tendency which urges speculative men to aim at\r\nmetaphysical generality rather than scientific truth.\r\n\r\nThe Dialogue _Parmenides_ is, as I have said, commonly referred to\r\nPlato. Yet it is entirely different in substance, manner, and\r\ntendency {492} from the most characteristic of the Platonic\r\nDialogues. In these, Socrates is represented as finally successful\r\nin refuting or routing his adversaries, however confident their tone\r\nand however popular their assertions. They are angered or humbled;\r\nhe retains his good temper and his air of superiority, and when they\r\nare exhausted, he sums up in his own way.\r\n\r\nIn the _Parmenides_, on the contrary, everything is the reverse of\r\nthis. Parmenides and Zeno exchange good-humoured smiles at\r\nSocrates's criticism, when the bystanders expect them to grow angry.\r\nThey listen to Socrates while he propounds Plato's doctrine of\r\nIdeas; and reply to him with solid arguments which he does not\r\nanswer, and which have never yet been answered. Parmenides, in a\r\npatronising way, lets him off; and having done this, being much\r\nentreated, he pronounces a discourse concerning the One and the\r\nMany; which, obscure as it may seem to us, was obviously intended to\r\nbe irrefutable: and during the whole of this part of the Dialogue,\r\nthe friend of Socrates appears only as a passive respondent, saying\r\n_Yes_ or _No_ as the assertions of Parmenides require him to do;\r\njust in the same way in which the opponents of Socrates are\r\nrepresented in other Dialogues.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, to which other historical difficulties might be\r\nadded, seem to show plainly that the _Parmenides_ must be regarded\r\nas an Eleatic, not as a Platonic Dialogue;--as composed to confute,\r\nnot to assert, the Platonic doctrine of Ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Platonic doctrine of Ideas has an important bearing upon the\r\nphilosophy of Science, and was suggested in a great measure by the\r\nprogress which the Greeks had really made in Geometry, Astronomy,\r\nand other Sciences, as I shall elsewhere endeavor to show. This\r\ndoctrine has been recommended in our own time,[1\\A] as containing \"a\r\nmighty substance of imperishable truth.\" It cannot fail to be\r\ninteresting to see in what manner the doctrine is presented by those\r\nwho thus judge of it. The following is the statement of its leading\r\nfeatures which they give us.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\A: A. Butler's _Lectures_, Second Series, Lect. viii. p. 132.]\r\n\r\nMan's soul is made to contain not merely a consistent scheme of its\r\nown notions, but a direct apprehension of _real and eternal laws\r\nbeyond it_. These real and eternal laws are things _intelligible_,\r\nand not things sensible. The laws, impressed upon creation by its\r\nCreator, and apprehended by man, are something equally distinct from\r\nthe Creator {493} and from man; and the whole mass of them may be\r\ntermed the World of Things purely Intelligible.\r\n\r\nFurther; there are qualities in the Supreme and Ultimate Cause of\r\nall, which are manifested in his creation; and not merely\r\nmanifested, but in a manner--after being brought out of his\r\nsuper-essential nature into the stage of being which is below him,\r\nbut next to him--are then, by the causative act of creation,\r\ndeposited in things, differencing them one from the other, so that\r\nthe things participate of them (μετέχουσι), communicate with them\r\n(κοινωνοῦσι).\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence of man, excited to reflection by the impressions of\r\nthese objects, thus (though themselves transitory) participant of a\r\ndivine quality, may rise to higher conceptions of the perfections\r\nthus faintly exhibited; and inasmuch as the perfections are\r\nunquestionably _real_ existences, and known to be such in the very\r\nact of contemplation, this may be regarded as a distinct\r\nintellectual apprehension of them;--a union of the Reason with the\r\nIdeas in that sphere of being which is common to both.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Reason, in proportion as it learns to contemplate the\r\nPerfect and Eternal, desires the enjoyment of such contemplations in\r\na more consummate degree, and cannot be fully satisfied except in\r\nthe actual fruition of the Perfect itself.\r\n\r\nThese propositions taken together constitute the THEORY OF IDEAS.\r\nWhen we have to treat of the Philosophy of Science, it may be worth\r\nour while to resume the consideration of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this part of the History, the _Timæus_ of Plato is referred to as\r\nan example of the loose notions of the Greek philosophers in their\r\nphysical reasonings. And undoubtedly this Dialogue does remarkably\r\nexemplify the boldness of the early Greek attempts at generalization\r\non such subjects. Yet in this and in other parts the writings of\r\nPlato contain speculations which may be regarded as containing germs\r\nof true physical science; inasmuch as they assume that the phenomena\r\nof the world are governed by mathematical laws;--by relations of\r\nspace and number;--and endeavor, too boldly, no doubt, but not\r\nvaguely or loosely, to assign those laws. The Platonic writings\r\noffer, in this way, so much that forms a Prelude to the Astronomy\r\nand other Physical Sciences of the Greeks, that they will deserve\r\nour notice, as supplying materials for the next two Books of the\r\nHistory, in which these subjects are treated of. {494}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE GREEK PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Francis Bacon's Remarks._\r\n\r\nTHOUGH we do not accept, as authority, even the judgments of Francis\r\nBacon, and shall have to estimate the strong and the weak parts of\r\nhis, no less than of other philosophies, we shall find his remarks\r\non the Greek philosophers very instructive. Thus he says of\r\nAristotle, (_Nov. Org._ 1. Aph. lxiii.):\r\n\r\n\"He is an example of the kind of philosophy in which much is made\r\nout of little; so that the basis of experience is too narrow. He\r\ncorrupted Natural Philosophy by his Logic, and made the world out of\r\nhis Categories. He disposed of the distinction of _dense_ and\r\n_rare_, by which bodies occupy more or less dimensions or space, by\r\nthe frigid distinction of _act_ and _power_. He assigned to each\r\nkind of body a single proper motion, so that if they have any other\r\nmotion they must receive it from some extraneous source; and imposed\r\nmany other arbitrary rules upon Nature; being everywhere more\r\ncareful how one may give a ready answer, and make a positive\r\nassertion, than how he may apprehend the variety of nature.\r\n\r\n\"And this appears most evidently by the comparison of his philosophy\r\nwith the other philosophies which had any vogue in Greece. For the\r\n_Homoiomeria_[2\\A] of Anaxagoras, the _Atoms_ of Leucippus and\r\nDemocritus, the Heaven and Earth of Parmenides, the Love and Hate of\r\nEmpedocles, the Fire of Heraclitus, had some trace of the thoughts\r\nof a natural philosopher; some savor of experience, and nature, and\r\nbodily things; while the Physics of Aristotle, in general, sound\r\nonly of Logical Terms.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\A: For these technical forms of the Greeks, see Sec. 3 of\r\nthis chapter.]\r\n\r\n\"Nor let any one be moved by this--that in his books _Of Animals_,\r\nand in his _Problems_, and in others of his tracts, there is often a\r\nquoting of experiments. For he had made up his mind beforehand; and\r\ndid not consult experience in order to make right propositions and\r\naxioms, but when he had settled his system to his will, he twisted\r\nexperience {495} round, and made her bend to his system: so that in\r\nthis way he is even more wrong than his modern followers, the\r\nSchoolmen, who have deserted experience altogether.\"\r\n\r\nWe may note also what Bacon says of the term _Sophist_. (Aph. lxxi.)\r\n\"The wisdom of the Greeks was professorial, and prone to run into\r\ndisputations: which kind is very adverse to the discovery of Truth.\r\nAnd the name of _Sophists_, which was cast in the way of contempt,\r\nby those who wished to be reckoned philosophers, upon the old\r\nprofessors of rhetoric, Gorgias, Protagoras, Hippias, Polus, does,\r\nin fact, fit the whole race of them, Plato,[3\\A] Aristotle, Zeno,\r\nEpicurus, Theophrastus; and their successors, Chrysippus, Carneades,\r\nand the rest.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\A: It is curious that the attempt to show that Plato's\r\nopponents were not commonly illusive and immoral reasoners, has been\r\nrepresented as an attempt to obliterate the distinction of \"Sophist\"\r\nand \"Philosopher.\"--See A. Butler's _Lectures_, i. 357. Note.]\r\n\r\nThat these two classes of teachers, as moralists, were not different\r\nin their kind, has been urged by Mr. Grote in a very striking and\r\namusing manner. But Bacon speaks of them here as physical\r\nphilosophers; in which character he holds that all of them were\r\n_sophists_, that is, illusory reasoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aristotle's Account of the Rainbow._\r\n\r\nTo exemplify the state of physical knowledge among the Greeks, we may\r\nnotice briefly Aristotle's account of the _Rainbow_; a phenomenon so\r\nstriking and definite, and so completely explained by the optical\r\nscience of later times. We shall see that not only the explanations\r\nthere offered were of no value, but that even the observation of\r\nfacts, so common and so palpable, was inexact. In his _Meteorologica_\r\n(lib. iii. c. 2) he says, \"The Rainbow is never more than a\r\nsemicircle. And at sunset and sunrise, the circle is least, but the\r\narch is greatest; when the sun is high, the circle is larger, but the\r\narch is less.\" This is erroneous, for the diameter of the circle of\r\nwhich the arch of the rainbow forms a part, is always the same, namely\r\n82°. \"After the autumnal equinox,\" he adds, \"it appears at every hour\r\nof the day; but in the summer season, it does not appear about noon.\"\r\nIt is curious that he did not see the reason of this. The centre of\r\nthe circle of which the rainbow is part, is always opposite to the\r\nsun. And therefore if the sun be more than 41° above the horizon, the\r\ncentre of the rainbow will be so much below the horizon, that the\r\nplace of the rainbow will {496} be entirely below the horizon. In the\r\nlatitude of Athens, which is 38°, the equator is 52° above the\r\nhorizon, and the rainbow can be visible only when the sun is 11° lower\r\nthan it is at the equinoctial noon. These remarks, however, show a\r\ncertain amount of careful observation; and so do those which Aristotle\r\nmakes respecting the colors. \"Two rainbows at most appear: and of\r\nthese, each has three colors; but those in the outer bow are duller;\r\nand their order opposite to those in the inner. For in the inner bow\r\nthe first and largest arch is red; but in the outer bow the smallest\r\narch is red, the nearest to the inner; and the others in order. The\r\ncolors are red, green, and purple, such as painters cannot imitate.\"\r\nIt is curious to observe how often modern painters disregard even the\r\norder of the colors, which they could imitate, if they attended to it.\r\n\r\nIt may serve to show the loose speculation which we oppose to\r\nscience, if we give Aristotle's attempt to explain the phenomenon of\r\nthe Rainbow. It is produced, he says (c. iv.), by Reflexion\r\n(ἀνάκλασις) from a cloud opposite to the sun, when the cloud forms\r\ninto drops. And as a reason for the red color, he says that a\r\nbright object seen through darkness appears red, as the flame\r\nthrough the smoke of a fire of green wood. This notion hardly\r\ndeserves notice; and yet it was taken up again by Göthe in our own\r\ntime, in his speculations concerning colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{497}}\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN ANCIENT GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plato's Timæus and Republic._\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH a great portion of the physical speculations of the Greek\r\nphilosophers was fanciful, and consisted of doctrines which were\r\nrejected in the subsequent progress of the Inductive Sciences; still\r\nmany of these speculations must be considered as forming a Prelude\r\nto more exact knowledge afterwards attained; and thus, as really\r\nbelonging to the Progress of knowledge. These speculations express,\r\nas we have already said, the conviction that the phenomena of nature\r\nare governed by laws of space and number; and commonly, the\r\nmathematical laws which are thus asserted have some foundation in\r\nthe facts of nature. This is more especially the case in the\r\nspeculations of Plato. It has been justly stated by Professor\r\nThompson (A. Butler's _Lectures_, Third Series, Lect. i. Note 11),\r\nthat it is Plato's merit to have discovered that the laws of the\r\nphysical universe are resolvable into numerical relations, and\r\ntherefore capable of being represented by mathematical formulæ. Of\r\nthis truth, it is there said, Aristotle does not betray the\r\nslightest consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe _Timæus_ of Plato contains a scheme of mathematical and physical\r\ndoctrines concerning the universe, which make it far more analogous\r\nthan any work of Aristotle to Treatises which, in modern times, have\r\nborne the titles of _Principia_, _System of the World_, and the like.\r\nAnd fortunately the work has recently been well and carefully studied,\r\nwith attention, not only to the language, but to the doctrines and\r\ntheir bearing upon our real knowledge. Stallbaum has published an\r\nedition of the Dialogue, and has compared the opinions of Plato with\r\nthose of Aristotle on the like subjects. Professor Archer Butler of\r\nDublin has devoted to it several of his striking and eloquent\r\nLectures; and these have been furnished with valuable annotations by\r\nProfessor Thompson of Cambridge; and M. The. Henri Martin, then\r\nProfessor at Rennes, published in 1841 two volumes of _Etudes sur le\r\nTimée de Platon_, in {498} which the bearings of the work on Science\r\nare very fully discussed. The Dialogue treats not only concerning the\r\nnumerical laws of harmonical sounds, of visual appearances, and of the\r\nmotions of planets and stars, but also concerning heat, as well as\r\nlight; and concerning water, ice, gold, gems, iron, rust, and other\r\nnatural objects;--concerning odors, tastes, hearing, sight, light,\r\ncolors, and the powers of sense in general:--concerning the parts and\r\norgans of the body, as the bones, the marrow, the brain, the flesh,\r\nmuscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves; the skin, the hair, the nails;\r\nthe veins and arteries; respiration; generation; and in short every\r\nobvious point of physiology.\r\n\r\nBut the opinions delivered in the _Timæus_ upon these latter\r\nsubjects have little to do with the progress of real knowledge. The\r\ndoctrines, on the other hand, which depend upon geometrical and\r\narithmetical relations, are portions or preludes of the sciences\r\nwhich, in the fulness of time, assumed a mathematical form for the\r\nexpression of truth.\r\n\r\nAmong these may be mentioned the arithmetical relations of\r\nharmonical sounds, to which I have referred in the History. These\r\noccur in various parts of Plato's writings. In the _Timæus_, in\r\nwhich the numbers are most fully given, the meaning of the numbers\r\nis, at first sight, least obvious. The numbers are given as\r\nrepresenting the proportion of the parts of the Soul (_Tim._ pp. 35,\r\n36), which does not immediately refer us to the relations of Sounds.\r\nBut in a subsequent part of the Dialogue (47, D), we are told that\r\nmusic is a privilege of the hearing given on account of Harmony; and\r\nthat Harmony has Cycles corresponding to the movements of the Soul;\r\n(referring plainly to those already asserted.) And the numbers which\r\nare thus given by Plato as elements of harmony, are in a great\r\nmeasure the same as those which express the musical relations of the\r\ntones of the musical scale at this day in use, as M. Henri Martin\r\nshows (_Et. sur le Timée_, note xxiii.) The intervals C to D, C to\r\nF, C to G, C to C, are expressed by the fractions 9/8, 4/3, 3/2,\r\n2/1, and are now called a Tone, a Fourth, a Fifth, an Octave. They\r\nwere expressed by the same fractions among the Greeks, and were\r\ncalled _Tone_, _Diatessaron_, _Diapente_, _Diapason_. The Major and\r\nMinor Third, and the Major and Minor Sixth, were however wanting, it\r\nis conceived, in the musical scale of Plato.\r\n\r\nThe _Timæus_ contains also a kind of theory of vision by reflexion\r\nfrom a plane, and in a concave mirror; although the theory is in\r\nthis case less mathematical and less precise than that of Euclid,\r\nreferred to in chap. ii. of this Book.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable speculations in the _Timæus_ is that in\r\n{499} which the Regular Solids are assigned as the forms of the\r\nElements of which the Universe is composed. This curious branch of\r\nmathematics, Solid Geometry, had been pursued with great zeal by\r\nPlato and his friends, and with remarkable success. The five Regular\r\nSolids, the Tetrahedron or regular Triangular Pyramid, the Cube, the\r\nOctahedron, the Dodecahedron, and the Icosahedron, had been\r\ndiscovered; and the remarkable theorem, that of regular solids there\r\ncan be just so many, these and no others, was known. And in the\r\n_Timæus_ it is asserted that the particles of the various elements\r\nhave the forms of these solids. Fire has the Pyramid; Earth has the\r\nCube; Water the Octahedron; Air the Icosahedron; and the\r\nDodecahedron is the plan of the Universe itself. It was natural that\r\nwhen Plato had learnt that other mathematical properties had a\r\nbearing upon the constitution of the Universe, he should suppose\r\nthat the singular property of space, which the existence of this\r\nlimited and varied class of solids implied, should have some\r\ncorresponding property in the Universe, which exists in space.\r\n\r\nWe find afterwards, in Kepler and others, a recurrence to this\r\nassumption; and we may say perhaps that Crystallography shows us that\r\nthere are properties of bodies, of the most intimate kind, which\r\ninvolve such spatial relations as are exhibited in the Regular Solids.\r\nIf the distinctions of Crystalline System in bodies were hereafter to\r\nbe found to depend upon the chemical elements which predominate in\r\ntheir composition, the admirers of Plato might point to his doctrine,\r\nof the different form of the particles of the different elements of\r\nthe Universe, as a remote Prelude to such a discovery.\r\n\r\nBut the mathematical doctrines concerning the parts and elements of\r\nthe Universe are put forwards by Plato, not so much as assertions\r\nconcerning physical facts, of which the truth or falsehood is to be\r\ndetermined by a reference to nature herself. They are rather\r\npropounded as examples of a truth of a higher kind than any\r\nreference to observation can give or can test, and as revelations of\r\nprinciples such as must have prevailed in the mind of the Creator of\r\nthe Universe; or else as contemplations by which the mind of man is\r\nto be raised above the region of sense, and brought nearer to the\r\nDivine Mind. In the _Timæus_ these doctrines appear rather in the\r\nformer of the two lights; as an exposition of the necessary scheme\r\nof creation, so far as its leading features are concerned. In the\r\nseventh Book of the _Polity_, the same doctrines are regarded more\r\nas a mental discipline; as the necessary study of the true\r\nphilosopher. But in both places these mathematical {500}\r\npropositions are represented as Realities more real than the\r\nPhenomena;--as a Natural Philosophy of a higher kind than the study\r\nof Nature itself can teach. This is no doubt an erroneous\r\nassumption: yet even in this there is a germ of truth; namely, that\r\nthe mathematical laws, which prevail in the universe, involve\r\nmathematical truths  which being demonstrative, are of a higher and\r\nmore cogent kind than mere experimental truths.\r\n\r\nNotions, such as these of Plato, respecting a truth at which science\r\nis to aim, which is of an exact and demonstrative kind, and is\r\nimperfectly manifested in the phenomena of nature, may help or may\r\nmislead inquirers; they may be the impulse and the occasion to great\r\ndiscoveries; or they may lead to the assertion of false and the loss\r\nof true doctrines. Plato considers the phenomena which nature offers\r\nto the senses as mere suggestions and rude sketches of the objects\r\nwhich the philosophic mind is to contemplate. The heavenly bodies\r\nand all the splendors of the sky, though the most beautiful of\r\nvisible objects, being only visible objects, are far inferior to the\r\ntrue objects of which they are the representatives. They are merely\r\ndiagrams which may assist in the study of the higher truth  as we\r\nmight study geometry by the aid of diagrams constructed by some\r\nconsummate artist. Even then, the true object about which we reason\r\nis the conception which we have in the mind.\r\n\r\nWe have, I conceive, an instance of the error as well as of the\r\ntruth, to which such views may lead, in the speculations of Plato\r\nconcerning Harmony, contained in that part of his writings (the\r\nseventh Book of the _Republic_), in which these views are especially\r\nurged. He there, by way of illustrating the superiority of\r\nphilosophical truth over such exactness as the senses can attest,\r\nspeaks slightingly of those who take immense pains in measuring\r\nmusical notes and intervals by the ear, as the astronomers measure the\r\nheavenly motions by the eye. \"They screw their pegs and pinch their\r\nstrings, and dispute whether two notes are the same or not.\" Now, in\r\ntruth, the ear is the final and supreme judge whether two notes are\r\nthe same or not. But there is a case in which notes which are\r\nnominally the same, are different really and to the ear; and it is\r\nprobably to disputes on this subject, which we know did prevail among\r\nthe Greek musicians, that Plato here refers. We may ascend from a note\r\nA_{1} to a note C_{3} by two octaves and a third. We may also ascend\r\nfrom the same note A_{1} to C_{3} by fifths four times repeated. But\r\nthe two notes C_{3} thus arrived at are not the same: they differ by a\r\nsmall interval, which the Greeks called a {501} Comma, of which the\r\nnotes are in the ratio of 80 to 81. That the ear really detects this\r\ndefect of the musical coincidence of the two notes under the proper\r\nconditions, is a proof of the coincidence of our musical perceptions\r\nwith the mathematical relations of the notes; and is therefore an\r\nexperimental confirmation of the mathematical principles of harmony.\r\nBut it seems to be represented by Plato, that to look out for such\r\nconfirmation of mathematical principles, implies a disposition to lean\r\non the senses, which he regards as very unphilosophical.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hero of Alexandria._\r\n\r\nTHE other branches of mathematical science which I have spoken of in\r\nthe History as cultivated by the Greeks, namely Mechanics and\r\nHydrostatics, are not treated expressly by Plato; though we know\r\nfrom Aristotle and others that some of the propositions of those\r\nsciences were known about his time. Machines moved not only by\r\nweights and springs, but by water and air, were constructed at an\r\nearly period. Ctesibius, who lived probably about B. C. 250, under\r\nthe Ptolemies, is said to have invented a clepsydra or water-clock,\r\nand an hydraulic organ; and to have been the first to discover the\r\nelastic power of air, and to apply it as a moving power. Of his\r\npupil Hero, the name is to this day familiar, through the little\r\npneumatic instrument called _Hero's Fountain_. He also described\r\npumps and hydraulic machines of various kinds; and an instrument\r\nwhich has been spoken of by some modern writers as a _steam-engine_,\r\nbut which was merely a toy made to whirl round by the steam emitted\r\nfrom holes in its arms. Concerning mechanism, besides descriptions\r\nof _Automatons_, Hero composed two works: the one entitled\r\n_Mechanics_, or _Mechanical Introductions_; the other _Barulcos_,\r\nthe _Weight-lifter_. In these works the elementary contrivances by\r\nwhich weights may be lifted or drawn were spoken of as the _Five\r\nMechanical Powers_, the same enumeration of such machines as\r\nprevails to this day; namely, the Lever, the Wheel and Axle, the\r\nPulley, the Wedge, and the Screw. In his Mechanics, it appears that\r\nHero reduced all these machines to one single machine, namely to the\r\nlever. In the _Barulcos_, Hero proposed and solved the problem which\r\nit was the glory of Archimedes to have solved: To move any object\r\n(however large) by any power (however small). This, as may easily be\r\nconceived by any one acquainted with the elements of Mechanics, is\r\ndone by means of a combination of the mechanical powers, and\r\nespecially by means of a train of toothed-wheels and axles. {502}\r\n\r\nThe remaining writings of Hero of Alexandria have been the subject\r\nof a special, careful, and learned examination by M. Th. H. Martin\r\n(Paris, 1854), in which the works of this writer, Hero the Ancient,\r\nas he is sometimes called, are distinguished from those of another\r\nwriter of the same name of later date.\r\n\r\nHero of Alexandria wrote also, as it appears, a treatise on\r\n_Pneumatics_, in which he described machines, either useful or\r\namusing, moved by the force of air and vapor.\r\n\r\nHe also wrote a work called _Catoptrics_, which contained proofs of\r\nproperties of the rays of reflected light.\r\n\r\nAnd a treatise _On the Dioptra_; which subject however must be\r\ncarefully distinguished from the subject entitled _Dioptrics_ by the\r\nmoderns. This latter subject treats of the properties of refracted\r\nlight; a subject on which the ancients had little exact knowledge\r\ntill a later period; as I have shown in the History. The _Dioptra_,\r\nas understood by Hero, was an instrument for taking angles so as to\r\nmeasure the position and hence to determine the distance of\r\ninaccessible objects; as is done by the _Theodolite_ in our times.\r\n\r\nM. Martin is of opinion that Hero of Alexandria lived at a later\r\nperiod than is generally supposed; namely, after B. C. 81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{503}}\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE mathematical opinions of Plato respecting the philosophy of\r\nnature, and especially respecting what we commonly call \"the\r\nheavenly bodies,\" the Sun, Moon, and Planets, were founded upon the\r\nview which I have already described: namely, that it is the business\r\nof philosophy to aim at a truth higher than observation can teach;\r\nand to solve problems which the phenomena of the universe only\r\nsuggest. And though the students of nature in more recent times have\r\nlearnt that this is too presumptuous a notion of human knowledge,\r\nyet the very boldness and hopefulness which it involved impelled men\r\nin the pursuit of truth, with more vigor than a more timorous temper\r\ncould have done; and the belief that there must be, in nature,\r\nmathematical laws more exact than experience could discover,\r\nstimulated men often to discover true laws, though often also to\r\ninvent false laws. Plato's writings, supplying examples of both\r\nthese processes, belong to the Prelude of true Astronomy, as well as\r\nto the errors of false philosophy. We may find specimens of both\r\nkinds in those parts of his Dialogues to which we have referred in\r\nthe preceding Book of our History.\r\n\r\nTo Plato's merits in preparing the way for the Theory of Epicycles,\r\nI have already referred in Chapter ii. of this Book. I conceive that\r\nhe had a great share in that which is an important step in every\r\ndiscovery, the proposing distinctly the problem to be solved; which\r\nwas, in this case, as he states it, To account for the apparent\r\nmovements of the planets by a combination of two circular motions\r\nfor each:--the motion of identity, and the motion of difference.\r\n(_Tim._ 39, A.) In the tenth Book of the _Republic_, quoted in our\r\ntext, the spindle which Destiny or Necessity holds between her\r\nknees, and on which are rings, by means of which the planets revolve\r\nround it as an axis, is a step towards the conception of the\r\nproblem, as the construction of a machine.\r\n\r\nIt will not be thought surprising that Plato expected that {504}\r\nAstronomy, when further advanced, would be able to render an account\r\nof many things for which she has not accounted even to this day.\r\nThus, in the passage in the seventh Book of the _Republic_, he says\r\nthat the philosopher requires a reason for the proportion of the day\r\nto the month, and the month to the year, deeper and more substantial\r\nthan mere observation can give. Yet Astronomy has not yet shown us\r\nany reason why the proportion of the times of the earth's rotation\r\non its axis, the moon's revolution round the earth, and the earth's\r\nrevolution round the sun, might not have been made by the Creator\r\nquite different from what they are. But in thus asking Mathematical\r\nAstronomy for reasons which she cannot give, Plato was only doing\r\nwhat a great astronomical discoverer, Kepler, did at a later period.\r\nOne of the questions which Kepler especially wished to have answered\r\nwas, why there are five planets, and why at such particular\r\ndistances from the sun? And it is still more curious that he thought\r\nhe had found the reason of these things, in the relations of those\r\nFive Regular Solids which, as we have seen, Plato was desirous of\r\nintroducing into the philosophy of the universe. We have Kepler's\r\naccount of this, his imaginary discovery, in the _Mysterium\r\nCosmographicum_, published in 1596, as stated in our History, Book\r\nv. Chap. iv. Sect. 2.\r\n\r\nKepler regards the law which thus determines the number and magnitude\r\nof the planetary orbits by means of the five regular solids as a\r\ndiscovery no less remarkable and certain than the Three Laws which\r\ngive his name its imperishable place in the history of astronomy.\r\n\r\nWe are not on this account to think that there is no steady\r\ncriterion of the difference between imaginary and real discoveries\r\nin science. As discovery becomes possible by the liberty of\r\nguessing, it becomes real by allowing observation constantly and\r\nauthoritatively to determine the value of guesses. Kepler added to\r\nPlato's boldness of fancy his own patient and candid habit of\r\ntesting his fancies by a rigorous and laborious comparison with the\r\nphenomena; and thus his discoveries led to those of Newton. {505}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST STAGES OF ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Globular Form of the Earth._\r\n\r\nTHERE are parts of Plato's writings which have been adduced as bearing\r\nupon the subsequent progress of science; and especially upon the\r\nglobular form of the earth, and the other views which led to the\r\ndiscovery of America. In the _Timæus_ we read of a great continent\r\nlying in the Ocean west of the Pillars of Hercules, which Plato calls\r\n_Atlantis_. He makes the personage in his Dialogue who speaks of this\r\nput it forward as an Egyptian tradition. M. H. Martin, who has\r\ndiscussed what has been written respecting the Atlantis of Plato, and\r\nhas given therein a dissertation rich in erudition and of the most\r\nlively interest, conceives that Plato's notions on this subject arose\r\nfrom his combining his conviction of the spherical form of the earth,\r\nwith interpretations of Homer, and perhaps with traditions which were\r\ncurrent in Egypt (_Etudes sur le Timée_, Note xiii. § ix.). He does\r\nnot consider that the belief in Plato's Atlantis had any share in the\r\ndiscoveries of Columbus.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps surprise modern readers who have a difficulty in\r\ngetting rid of the persuasion that there is a natural direction\r\n_upwards_ and a natural direction _downwards_, to learn that both\r\nPlato and Aristotle, and of course other philosophers also, had\r\ncompletely overcome this difficulty. They were quite ready to allow\r\nand to conceive that _down_ meant nothing but towards some centre,\r\nand _up_, the opposite direction. (Aristotle has, besides, an\r\ningenious notion that while heavy bodies, as earth and water, tend\r\nto the centre, and light bodies, as fire, tend from the centre, the\r\nfifth element, of which the heavenly bodies are composed, tends to\r\nmove _round_ the centre.)\r\n\r\nPlato explains this in the most decided manner in the _Timæus_ (62,\r\nC). \"It is quite erroneous to suppose that there are two opposite\r\nregions in the universe, one above and the other below; and that\r\nheavy things naturally tend to the latter place. The heavens are\r\nspherical, and every thing tends to the centre; and thus _above_ and\r\n_below_ have no real meaning. If there be a solid globe in the\r\nmiddle, {506} and if a person walk round it, he will become the\r\nantipodes to himself, and the direction which is _up_ at one time\r\nwill be _down_ at another.\"\r\n\r\nThe notion of _antipodes_, the inhabitants of the part of the globe\r\nof the earth opposite to ourselves, was very familiar. Thus in\r\nCicero's _Academic Questions_ (ii. 39) one of the speakers says,\r\n\"Etiam dicitis esse e regione nobis, e contraria parte terræ, qui\r\nadversis vestigiis stant contra nostra vestigia, quos Antipodas\r\nvocatis.\" See also _Tusc. Disp._ i. 28 and v. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Heliocentric System among the Ancients._\r\n\r\nAs the more clear-sighted of the ancients had overcome the natural\r\nprejudice of believing that there is an absolute _up_ and _down_, so\r\nhad they also overcome the natural prejudice of believing that the\r\nearth is at rest. Cicero says (_Acad. Quest._ ii. 39), \"Hicetas of\r\nSyracuse, as Theophrastus tells us, thinks that the heavens, the\r\nsun, the moon, the stars, do not move; and that nothing does move\r\nbut the earth. The earth revolves about her axis with immense\r\nvelocity; and thus the same effect is produced as if the earth were\r\nat rest and the heavens moved; and this, he says, Plato teaches in\r\nthe _Timæus_, though somewhat obscurely.\" Of course the assertion\r\nthat the moon and planets do not move, was meant of the diurnal\r\nmotion only. The passage referred to in the _Timæus_ seems to be\r\nthis (40, C)--\"As to the Earth, which is our nurse, and which\r\n_clings to_ the axis which stretches through the universe, God made\r\nher the producer and preserver of day and night.\" The word\r\nεἱλλομένην, which I have translated _clings to_, some translate\r\n_revolves_; and an extensive controversy has prevailed, both in\r\nancient and modern times (beginning with Aristotle), whether Plato\r\ndid or did not believe in the rotation of the earth on her axis.\r\n(See M. Cousin's Note on the _Timæus_, and M. Henri Martin's\r\nDissertation, Note xxxvii., in his _Etudes sur le Timée_.) The\r\nresult of this discussion seems to be that, in the _Timæus_, the\r\nEarth is supposed to be at rest. It is however related by Plutarch\r\n(_Platonic Questions_, viii. 1), that Plato in his old age repented\r\nof having given to the Earth the place in the centre of the universe\r\nwhich did not belong to it.\r\n\r\nIn describing the Prelude to the Epoch of Copernicus (Book v. Chap.\r\ni.), I have spoken of Philolaus, one of the followers of Pythagoras,\r\nwho lived at the time of Socrates, as having held the doctrine that\r\nthe earth revolves about the sun. This has been a current {507}\r\nopinion;--so current, indeed, that the Abbé Bouillaud, or\r\nBullialdus, as we more commonly call him, gave the title of\r\n_Philolaus_ to the defence of Copernicus which he published in 1639;\r\nand Chiaramonti, an Aristotelian, published his answer under the\r\ntitle of _Antiphilolaus_. In 1645 Bullialdus published his\r\n_Astronomia Philolaica_, which was another exposition of the\r\nheliocentric doctrine.\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding this general belief, it appears to be tolerably\r\ncertain that Philolaus did not hold the doctrine of the earth's\r\nmotion round the sun. (M. H. Martin, _Etudes sur le Timée_, 1841,\r\nNote xxxvii. Sect. i.; and Bœckh, _De vera Indole Astronomiæ\r\nPhilolaicæ_, 1810.) In the system of Philolaus, the earth revolved\r\nabout _the central fire_; but this central fire was not the sun. The\r\nSun, along with the moon and planets, revolved in circles external\r\nto the earth. The Earth had the _Antichthon_ or _Counter-Earth_\r\nbetween it and the centre; and revolving round this centre in one\r\nday, the Antichthon, being always between it and the centre, was,\r\nduring a portion of the revolution, interposed between the Earth and\r\nthe Sun, and thus made night; while the Sun, by his proper motion,\r\nproduced the changes of the year.\r\n\r\nWhen men were willing to suppose the earth to be in motion, in order\r\nto account for the recurrence of day and night, it is curious that\r\nthey did not see that the revolution of a spherical earth about an\r\naxis passing through its centre was a scheme both simple and quite\r\nsatisfactory. Yet the illumination of a globular earth by a distant\r\nsun, and the circumstances and phenomena thence resulting, appear to\r\nhave been conceived in a very confused manner by many persons. Thus\r\nTacitus (_Agric._ xii.), after stating that he has heard that in the\r\nnorthern part of the island of Britain, the night disappears in the\r\nheight of summer, says, as his account of this phenomenon, that \"the\r\nextreme parts of the earth are low and level, and do not throw their\r\nshadow upwards; so that the shade of night falls below the sky and\r\nthe stars.\" But, as a little consideration will show, it is the\r\nglobular form of the earth, and not the level character of the\r\ncountry, which produces this effect.\r\n\r\nIt is not in any degree probable that Pythagoras taught that the Earth\r\nrevolves round the Sun, or that it rotates on its own axis. Nor did\r\nPlato hold either of these motions of the Earth. They got so far as to\r\nbelieve in the Spherical Form of the Earth; and this was apparently\r\nsuch an effort that the human mind made a pause before going any\r\nfurther. \"It required,\" says M. H. Martin, \"a great struggle for {508}\r\nmen to free themselves from the prejudices of the senses, and to\r\ninterpret their testimony in such a manner as to conceive the\r\nsphericity of the earth. It is natural that they should have stopped\r\nat this point, before putting the earth in motion in space.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the expressions which have been understood, as describing a\r\nsystem in which the Sun is the _centre of motion_, do really imply\r\nmerely the Sun is the _middle term_ of the series of heavenly bodies\r\nwhich revolve round the earth: the series being Moon, Mercury,\r\nVenus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. This is the case, for instance,\r\nin a passage of Cicero's _Vision of Scipio_, which has been supposed\r\nto imply, (as I have stated in the History,) that Mercury and Venus\r\nrevolve about the Sun.\r\n\r\nBut though the doctrine of the diurnal rotation and annual\r\nrevolution of the earth is not the doctrine of Pythagoras, or of\r\nPhilolaus, or of Plato, it was nevertheless held by some of the\r\nphilosophers of antiquity. The testimony of Archimedes that this\r\ndoctrine was held by his contemporary Aristarchus of Samos, is\r\nunquestionable  and there is no reason to doubt Plutarch's assertion\r\nthat Seleucus further enforced it.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that Copernicus appears not to have known anything of\r\nthe opinions of Aristarchus and Seleucus, which were really\r\nanticipations of his doctrine; and to have derived his notion from\r\npassages which, as I have been showing, contain no such doctrine. He\r\nsays, in his Dedication to Pope Paul III., \"I found in Cicero that\r\nNicetas [or Hicetas] held that the earth was in motion: and in\r\nPlutarch I found that some others had been of that opinion: and his\r\nwords I will transcribe that any one may read them: 'Philosophers in\r\ngeneral hold that the earth is at rest. But Philolaus the\r\nPythagorean teaches that it moves round the central fire in an\r\noblique circle, in the same direction as the Sun and the Moon.\r\nHeraclides of Pontus and Ecphantus the Pythagorean give the earth a\r\nmotion, but not a motion of translation; they make it revolve like a\r\nwheel about its own centre from west to east.'\" This last opinion was\r\na correct assertion of the diurnal motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eclipse of Thales._\r\n\r\n\"THE Eclipse of Thales\" is so remarkable a point in the history of\r\nastronomy, and has been the subject of so much discussion among\r\nastronomers, that it ought to be more especially noticed. The\r\noriginal {509} record is in the first Book of Herodotus's History\r\n(chap. lxxiv.) He says that there was a war between the Lydians and\r\nthe Medes; and after various turns of fortune, \"in the sixth year a\r\nconflict took place; and on the battle being joined, it happened\r\nthat the day suddenly became night. And this change, Thales of\r\nMiletus had predicted to them, definitely naming this year, in which\r\nthe event really took place. The Lydians and the Medes, when they\r\nsaw day turned into night, ceased from fighting; and both sides were\r\ndesirous of peace.\" Probably this prediction was founded upon the\r\nChaldean period of eighteen years, of which I have spoken in Section\r\n11. It is probable, as I have already said, that this period was\r\ndiscovered by noticing the recurrence of eclipses. It is to be\r\nobserved that Thales predicted only the year of the eclipse, not the\r\nday or the month. In fact, the exact prediction of the circumstances\r\nof an eclipse of the sun is a very difficult problem; much more\r\ndifficult, it may be remarked, than the prediction of the\r\ncircumstance of an eclipse of the moon.\r\n\r\nNow that the Theory of the Moon is brought so far towards\r\ncompleteness, astronomers are able to calculate backwards the\r\neclipses of the sun which have taken place in former times; and the\r\nquestion has been much discussed in what year this Eclipse of Thales\r\nreally occurred. The Memoir of Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, on\r\nthis subject, in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1853, gives an account of\r\nthe modern examinations of this subject. Mr. Airy starts from the\r\nassumption that the eclipse must have been one decidedly total; the\r\ndifference between such a one and an eclipse only _nearly_ total\r\nbeing very marked. A total eclipse alone was likely to produce so\r\nstrong an effect on the minds of the combatants. Mr. Airy concludes\r\nfrom his calculations that the eclipse predicted by Thales took\r\nplace B. C. 585.\r\n\r\nAncient eclipses of the Moon and Sun, if they can be identified, are\r\nof great value for modern astronomy; for in the long interval of\r\nbetween two and three thousand years which separates them from our\r\ntime, those of the _inequalities_, that is, accelerations or\r\nretardations of the Moon's motion, which go on increasing\r\nconstantly,[4\\A] accumulate to a large amount; so that the actual\r\ntime and circumstances of the eclipse give astronomers the means of\r\ndetermining what the rate of these accelerations or retardations has\r\nbeen. Accordingly Mr. Airy has discussed, as even more important\r\nthan the eclipse of Thales, an eclipse which Diodorus relates to\r\nhave happened during an expedition of {510} Agathocles, the ruler of\r\nSicily, and which is hence known as the Eclipse of Agathocles. He\r\ndetermines it to have occurred B. C. 310.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\A: Or at least for very long periods.]\r\n\r\nM. H. Martin, in Note xxxvii. to his _Etudes sur le Timée_,\r\ndiscusses among other astronomical matters, the Eclipse of Thales.\r\nHe does not appear to render a very cordial belief to the historical\r\nfact of Thales having delivered the prediction before the event. He\r\nsays that even if Thales did make such a prediction of an eclipse of\r\nthe sun, as he might do, by means of the Chaldean period of 18\r\nyears, or 223 lunations, he would have to take the chance of its\r\nbeing visible in Greece, about which he could only guess:--that no\r\nauthor asserts that Thales, or his successors Anaximander and\r\nAnaxagoras, ever tried their luck in the same way again:--that \"en\r\nrevanche\" we are told that Anaximander predicted an earthquake, and\r\nAnaxagoras the fall of aërolites, which are plainly fabulous\r\nstories, though as well attested as the Eclipse of Thales. He adds\r\nthat according to Aristotle, Thales and Anaximenes were so far from\r\nhaving sound notions of cosmography, that they did not even believe\r\nin the roundness of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{511}}\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the twelfth Book of the _Philosophy_, in which I have given a\r\nReview of Opinions on the Nature of Knowledge and the method of\r\nseeking it, I have given some account of several of the most important\r\npersons belonging to the ages now under consideration. I have there\r\n(vol. ii. b. xii. p. 146) spoken of the manner in which remarks made\r\nby Aristotle came to be accepted as fundamental maxims in the schools\r\nof the middle ages, and of the manner in which they were discussed by\r\nthe greatest of the schoolmen, as Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, and\r\nthe like. I have spoken also (p. 149) of a certain kind of recognition\r\nof the derivation of our knowledge from experience; as shown in\r\nRichard of St. Victor, in the twelfth century. I have considered (p.\r\n152) the plea of the admirers of those ages, that religious authority\r\nwas not claimed for physical science.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that the rise of Experimental Philosophy exhibited\r\ntwo features (chap. vii. p. 155), the Insurrection against\r\nAuthority, and the Appeal to Experience: and as exemplifying these\r\nfeatures, I have spoken of Raymond Lully and of Roger Bacon. I have\r\nfurther noticed the opposition to the prevailing Aristotelian\r\ndogmatism manifested (chap. viii.) by Nicolas of Cus, Marsilius\r\nFicinus, Francis Patricius, Picus of Mirandula, Cornelius Agrippa,\r\nTheophrastus Paracelsus, Robert Fludd. I have gone on to notice the\r\nTheoretical Reformers of Science (chap. ix.), Bernardinus Telesius,\r\nThomas Campanella, Andreas Cæsalpinus, Peter Ramus; and the\r\nProtestant Reformers, as Melancthon. After these come the Practical\r\nReformers of Science, who have their place in the subsequent history\r\nof Inductive Philosophy; Leonardo da Vinci, and the Heralds of the\r\ndawning light of real science, whom Francis Bacon welcomes, as\r\nHeralds are accosted in Homer:\r\n  Χαίρετε Κήρυκες Διὸς ἄγγελοι ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν.\r\n  Hail, Heralds, messengers of Gods and men! {512}\r\n\r\nI have, in the part of the _Philosophy_ referred to, discussed the\r\nmerits and defects of Francis Bacon's _Method_, and I shall have\r\noccasion, in the next Book, to speak of his mode of dealing with the\r\npositive science of his time. There is room for much more reflexion on\r\nthese subjects, but the references now made may suffice at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Aquinas._\r\n\r\nAQUINAS wrote (besides the _Summa_ mentioned in the text) a\r\nCommentary on the Physics of Aristotle: _Commentaria in Aristotelis\r\nLibros Physicorum_, Venice, 1492. This work is of course of no\r\nscientific value; and the commentary consists of empty permutations\r\nof abstract terms, similar to those which constitute the main\r\nsubstance of the text in Aristotle's physical speculations. There\r\nis, however, an attempt to give a more technical form to the\r\npropositions and their demonstrations. As specimens of these, I may\r\nmention that in Book vi. c. 2, we have a demonstration that when\r\nbodies move, the time and the magnitude (that is, the space\r\ndescribed), are divided similarly; with many like propositions. And\r\nin Book viii. we have such propositions as this (c. 10):\r\n\"Demonstration that a finite mover (_movens_) cannot move anything\r\nin an infinite time.\" This is illustrated by a diagram in which two\r\nhands are represented as engaged in moving a whole sphere, and one\r\nhand in moving a hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis mode of representing force, in diagrams illustrative of\r\nmechanical reasonings, by human hands pushing, pulling, and the\r\nlike, is still employed in elementary books. Probably this is the\r\nfirst example of such a mode of representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roger Bacon._\r\n\r\nTHIS writer, a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas, exhibits to us a kind\r\nof knowledge, speculation, and opinion, so different from that of any\r\nknown person near his time, that he deserves especial notice here;\r\n{513} and I shall transfer to this place the account which I have\r\ngiven of him in the _Philosophy_. I do this the more willingly because\r\nI regard the existence of such a work as the _Opus Majus_ at that\r\nperiod as a problem which has never yet been solved. Also I may add,\r\nthat the scheme of the Contents of this work which I have given,\r\ndeserves, as I conceive, more notice than it has yet received.\r\n\r\n\"Roger Bacon was born in 1214, near Ilchester, in Somersetshire, of\r\nan old family. In his youth he was a student at Oxford, and made\r\nextraordinary progress in all branches of learning. He then went to\r\nthe University of Paris, as was at that time the custom of learned\r\nEnglishmen, and there received the degree of Doctor of Theology. At\r\nthe persuasion of Robert Grostête, bishop of Lincoln, he entered the\r\nbrotherhood of Franciscans in Oxford, and gave himself up to study\r\nwith extraordinary fervor. He was termed by his brother monks\r\n_Doctor Mirabilis_. We know from his own works, as well as from the\r\ntraditions concerning him, that he possessed an intimate\r\nacquaintance with all the science of his time which could be\r\nacquired from books; and that he had made many remarkable advances\r\nby means of his own experimental labors. He was acquainted with\r\nArabic, as well as with the other languages common in his time. In\r\nthe title of his works, we find the whole range of science and\r\nphilosophy, Mathematics and Mechanics, Optics, Astronomy, Geography,\r\nChronology, Chemistry, Magic, Music, Medicine, Grammar, Logics,\r\nMetaphysics, Ethics, and Theology; and judging from those which are\r\npublished, these works are full of sound and exact knowledge. He is,\r\nwith good reason, supposed to have discovered, or to have had some\r\nknowledge of, several of the most remarkable inventions which were\r\nmade generally known soon afterwards; as gunpowder, lenses, burning\r\nspecula, telescopes, clocks, the correction of the calendar, and the\r\nexplanation of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n\"Thus possessing, in the acquirements and habits of his own mind,\r\nabundant examples of the nature of knowledge and of the process of\r\ninvention, Roger Bacon felt also a deep interest in the growth and\r\nprogress of science, a spirit of inquiry respecting the causes which\r\nproduced or prevented its advance, and a fervent hope and trust in\r\nits future destinies; and these feelings impelled him to speculate\r\nworthily and wisely respecting a Reform of the Method of\r\nPhilosophizing. The manuscripts of his works have existed for nearly\r\nsix hundred years in many of the libraries of Europe, and especially\r\nin those of England; and for a long period the very imperfect\r\nportions of them which were {514} generally known, left the\r\ncharacter and attainments of the author shrouded in a kind of\r\nmysterious obscurity. About a century ago, however, his _Opus Majus_\r\nwas published[5\\A] by Dr. S. Jebb, principally from a manuscript in\r\nthe library of Trinity College, Dublin; and this contained most or\r\nall of the separate works which were previously known to the public,\r\nalong with others still more peculiar and characteristic. We are\r\nthus able to judge of Roger Bacon's knowledge and of his views, and\r\nthey are in every way well worthy our attention.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\A: _Fratris Rogeri Bacon Ordinis Minorum_ Opus Majus _ad\r\nClementem Quartum, Pontificem Romanum, ex MS. Codice Dubliniensi cum\r\naliis quibusdam collato nunc primum edidit_ S. Jebb, M.D. Londini,\r\n1733.]\r\n\r\n\"The _Opus Majus_ is addressed to Pope Clement the Fourth, whom\r\nBacon had known when he was legate in England as Cardinal-bishop of\r\nSabina, and who admired the talents of the monk, and pitied him for\r\nthe persecutions to which he was exposed. On his elevation to the\r\npapal chair, this account of Bacon's labours and views was sent, at\r\nthe earnest request of the pontiff. Besides the _Opus Majus_, he\r\nwrote two others, the _Opus Minus_ and _Opus Tertium_; which were\r\nalso sent to the pope, as the author says,[6\\A] 'on account of the\r\ndanger of roads, and the possible loss of the work.' These works\r\nstill exist unpublished, in the Cottonian and other libraries.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\A: _Opus Majus_, Præf.]\r\n\r\n\"The _Opus Majus_ is a work equally wonderful with regard to its\r\ngeneral scheme, and to the special treatises with which the outlines\r\nof the plan are filled up. The professed object of the work is to\r\nurge the necessity of a reform in the mode of philosophizing, to set\r\nforth the reasons why knowledge had not made a greater progress, to\r\ndraw back attention to the sources of knowledge which had been\r\nunwisely neglected, to discover other sources which were yet almost\r\nuntouched, and to animate men in the undertaking, by a prospect of\r\nthe vast advantages which it offered. In the developement of this\r\nplan, all the leading portions of science are expounded in the most\r\ncomplete shape which they had at that time assumed; and improvements\r\nof a very wide and striking kind are proposed in some of the\r\nprincipal of these departments. Even if the work had had no leading\r\npurpose, it would have been highly valuable as a treasure of the\r\nmost solid knowledge and soundest speculations of the time; even if\r\nit had contained no such details, it would have been a work most\r\nremarkable for its general views and scope. It may be considered as,\r\nat the same time, the _Encyclopedia_ and the _Novum Organon_ of the\r\nthirteenth century. {515}\r\n\r\n\"Since this work is thus so important in the history of Inductive\r\nPhilosophy I shall give, in a Note, a view[7\\A] of its divisions and\r\ncontents. But I must now endeavor to point out more especially the\r\nway in which the various principles, which the reform of scientific\r\nmethod involved, are here brought into view.\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\A: Contents of Roger Bacon's _Opus Majus_:\r\nPart I.

On Experimental Science.]\r\n\r\n\"One of the first points to be noticed for this purpose, is the\r\nresistance to authority; and at the stage of philosophical history\r\nwith which we here have to do, this means resistance to the\r\nauthority of Aristotle, as adopted and interpreted by the Doctors of\r\nthe Schools. Bacon's work[8\\A] is divided into Six Parts; and of\r\nthese Parts, the First is, Of the four universal Causes of all Human\r\nIgnorance. The causes thus enumerated[9\\A] are:--the force of\r\nunworthy authority;--traditionary habit;--the imperfection of the\r\nundisciplined senses;--and the disposition to conceal our ignorance\r\nand to make an ostentatious show of our knowledge. These influences\r\ninvolve every man, occupy every condition. They prevent our\r\nobtaining the most useful and large and fair doctrines of wisdom,\r\nthe secrets of all sciences and arts. He then proceeds to argue,\r\nfrom the testimony of philosophers themselves, that the authority of\r\nantiquity, and especially of Aristotle, is not infallible. 'We\r\nfind[10\\A] their books full of doubts, obscurities, and\r\nperplexities. They {516} scarce agree with each other in one empty\r\nquestion or one worthless sophism, or one operation of science, as\r\none man agrees with another in the practical operations of medicine,\r\nsurgery, and the like arts of secular men. Indeed,' he adds,[11\\A]\r\n'not only the philosophers, but the saints have fallen into errors\r\nwhich they have afterwards retracted,' and this he instances in\r\nAugustin, Jerome, and others. He gives an admirable sketch of the\r\nprogress of philosophy from the Ionic School to Aristotle; of whom\r\nhe speaks with great applause. 'Yet,' he adds, 'those who came after\r\nhim corrected him in some things, and added many things to his\r\nworks, and shall go on adding to the end of the world.' Aristotle,\r\nhe adds, is now called peculiarly[12\\A] the Philosopher, 'yet there\r\nwas a time when his philosophy was silent and unregarded, either on\r\naccount of the rarity of copies of his works, or their difficulty,\r\nor from envy; till after the time of Mahomet, when Avicenna and\r\nAverroes, and others, recalled this philosophy into the full light\r\nof exposition. And although the Logic and some other works were\r\ntranslated by Boethius from the Greek, yet the philosophy of\r\nAristotle first received a quick increase among the Latins at the\r\ntime of Michael Scot; who, in the year of our Lord 1230, appeared,\r\nbringing with him portions of the books of Aristotle on Natural\r\nPhilosophy and Mathematics. And yet a small part only of the works\r\nof this author is translated, and a still smaller part is in the\r\nhands of common students.' He adds further[13\\A] (in the Third Part\r\nof the _Opus Majus_, which is a Dissertation on Language) that the\r\ntranslations which are current of these writings, are very bad and\r\nimperfect. With these views, he is moved to express himself somewhat\r\nimpatiently[14\\A] respecting these works: 'If I had,' he says,\r\n'power over the works of Aristotle, I would have them all burnt; for\r\nit is only a loss of time to study in them, and a course of error,\r\nand a multiplication of ignorance beyond expression.' 'The common\r\nherd of students,' he says, 'with their heads, have no principle by\r\nwhich they can be excited to any worthy employment; and hence they\r\nmope and make asses of themselves over their bad translations, and\r\nlose their time, and trouble, and money.' {517}\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\A: Ib. p. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\A: Ib. p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\A: _Autonomaticè_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\A: See _Pref._ to Jebb's edition. The passages there quoted,\r\nhowever, are not extracts from the _Opus Majus_, but (apparently) from\r\nthe _Opus Minus_ (_MS. Cott._ Tib. c . 5). \"Si haberem potestatem\r\nsupra libros Aristotelis, ego facerem omnes cremari; quia non est nisi\r\ntemporis amissio studere in illis, et causa erroris, et multiplicatio\r\nignorantiæ ultra id quod valeat explicari. . . . Vulgus studentum cum\r\ncapitibus suis non habet unde excitetur ad aliquid dignum, et ideo\r\nlanguet et _asininat_ circa male translata, et tempus et studium\r\namittit in omnibus et expensas.\"]\r\n\r\n\"The remedies which he recommends for these evils, are, in the first\r\nplace, the study of that only perfect wisdom which is to be found in\r\nthe Sacred Scripture;[15\\A] in the next place, the study of\r\nmathematics and the use of experiment.[16\\A] By the aid of these\r\nmethods, Bacon anticipates the most splendid progress for human\r\nknowledge. He takes up the strain of hope and confidence which we\r\nhave noticed as so peculiar in the Roman writers; and quotes some of\r\nthe passages of Seneca which we adduced in illustration of\r\nthis:--that the attempts in science were at first rude and\r\nimperfect, and were afterwards improved;--that the day will come,\r\nwhen what is still unknown shall be brought to light by the progress\r\nof time and the labors of a longer period;--that one age does not\r\nsuffice for inquiries so wide and various;--that the people of\r\nfuture times shall know many things unknown to us;--and that the\r\ntime shall arrive when posterity will wonder that we overlooked what\r\nwas so obvious. Bacon himself adds anticipations more peculiarly in\r\nthe spirit of his own time. 'We have seen,' he says, at the end of\r\nthe work, 'how Aristotle, by the ways which wisdom teaches, could\r\ngive to Alexander the empire of the world. And this the Church ought\r\nto take into consideration against the infidels and rebels, that\r\nthere may be a sparing of Christian blood, and especially on account\r\nof the troubles that shall come to pass in the days of Antichrist;\r\nwhich by the grace of God it would be easy to obviate, if prelates\r\nand princes would encourage study, and join in searching out the\r\nsecrets of nature and art.'\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\A: Part ii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\A: Parts iv. v. and vi.]\r\n\r\n\"It may not be improper to observe here that this belief in the\r\nappointed progress of knowledge, is not combined with any\r\noverweening belief in the unbounded and independent power of the\r\nhuman intellect. On the contrary, one of the lessons which Bacon\r\ndraws from the state and prospects of knowledge, is the duty of\r\nfaith and humility. 'To him,' he says,[17\\A] 'who denies the truth\r\nof the faith because he is unable to understand it, I will propose\r\nin reply the course of nature, and as we have seen it in examples.'\r\nAnd after giving some instances, he adds, 'These, and the like,\r\nought to move men and to excite them to the reception of divine\r\ntruths. For if, in the vilest objects of creation, truths are found,\r\nbefore which the inward pride of man must bow, and believe though it\r\ncannot understand, how much more should man humble his mind before\r\nthe glorious truths of God!' He had before said:[18\\A] 'Man is\r\nincapable of perfect wisdom in this life; it is hard for {518} him\r\nto ascend towards perfection, easy to glide downwards to falsehoods\r\nand vanities: let him then not boast of his wisdom, or extol his\r\nknowledge. What he knows is little and worthless, in respect of that\r\nwhich he believes without knowing; and still less, in respect of\r\nthat which he is ignorant of. He is mad who thinks highly of his\r\nwisdom; he most mad, who exhibits it as something to be wondered\r\nat.' He adds, as another reason for humility, that he has proved by\r\ntrial, he could teach in one year, to a poor boy, the marrow of all\r\nthat the most diligent person could acquire in forty years'\r\nlaborious and expensive study.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 476.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\A: Ib. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n\"To proceed somewhat more in detail with regard to Roger Bacon's views\r\nof a Reform in Scientific Inquiry, we may observe that by making\r\nMathematics and Experiment the two great points of his recommendation,\r\nhe directed his improvement to the two essential parts of all\r\nknowledge, Ideas and Facts, and thus took the course which the most\r\nenlightened philosophy would have suggested. He did not urge the\r\nprosecution of experiment, to the comparative neglect of the existing\r\nmathematical sciences and conceptions; a fault which there is some\r\nground for ascribing to his great namesake and successor Francis\r\nBacon: still less did he content himself with a mere protest against\r\nthe authority of the schools, and a vague demand for change, which was\r\nalmost all that was done by those who put themselves forward as\r\nreformers in the intermediate time. Roger Bacon holds his way steadily\r\nbetween the two poles of human knowledge; which, as we have seen, it\r\nis far from easy to do. 'There are two modes of knowing,' says\r\nhe;[19\\A] 'by argument, and by experiment. Argument concludes a\r\nquestion; but it does not make us feel certain, or acquiesce in the\r\ncontemplation of truth, except the truth be also found to be so by\r\nexperience.' It is not easy to express more decidedly the clearly-seen\r\nunion of exact conceptions with certain facts, which, as we have\r\nexplained, constitutes real knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 445; see also p. 448. \"Scientiæ aliæ\r\nsciunt sua principia invenire per experimenta, sed conclusiones per\r\nargumenta facta ex principiis inventis. Si vero debeant habere\r\nexperientiam conclusionum suarum particularem et completam, tunc\r\noportet quod habeant per adjutorium istius scientiæ nobilis\r\n(experimentalis).\"]\r\n\r\n\"One large division of the _Opus Majus_ is 'On the Usefulness of\r\nMathematics,' which is shown by a copious enumeration of existing\r\nbranches of knowledge, as Chronology, Geography, the Calendar and\r\n(in a separate Part) Optics. There is a chapter,[20\\A] in which it\r\nis proved {519} by reason, that all science requires mathematics.\r\nAnd the arguments which are used to establish this doctrine, show a\r\nmost just appreciation of the office of mathematics in science. They\r\nare such as follows:--That other sciences use examples taken from\r\nmathematics as the most evident:--That mathematical knowledge is, as\r\nit were, innate to us, on which point he refers to the well-known\r\ndialogue of Plato, as quoted by Cicero:--That this science, being\r\nthe easiest, offers the best introduction to the more\r\ndifficult:--That in mathematics, things as known to us are identical\r\nwith things as known to nature:--That we can here entirely avoid\r\ndoubt and error, and obtain certainty and truth:--That mathematics\r\nis prior to other sciences in nature, because it takes cognizance of\r\nquantity, which is apprehended by intuition (_intuitu intellectus_).\r\n'Moreover,' he adds,[21\\A] 'there have been found famous men, as\r\nRobert, bishop of Lincoln, and Brother Adam Marshman (de Marisco),\r\nand many others, who by the power of mathematics have been able to\r\nexplain the causes of things; as may be seen in the writings of\r\nthese men, for instance, concerning the Rainbow and Comets, and the\r\ngeneration of heat, and climates, and the celestial bodies.'\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\A: Ib. p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 64.]\r\n\r\n\"But undoubtedly the most remarkable portion of the _Opus Majus_ is\r\nthe Sixth and last Part, which is entitled 'De Scientia\r\nexperimentali.' It is indeed an extraordinary circumstance to find a\r\nwriter of the thirteenth century, not only recognizing experiment as\r\none source of knowledge, but urging its claims as something far more\r\nimportant than men had yet been aware of, exemplifying its value by\r\nstriking and just examples, and speaking of its authority with a\r\ndignity of diction which sounds like a foremurmur of the Baconian\r\nsentences uttered nearly four hundred years later. Yet this is the\r\ncharacter of what we here find.[22\\A] 'Experimental science, the\r\nsole mistress of speculative sciences, has three great Prerogatives\r\namong other parts of knowledge: First she tests by experiment the\r\nnoblest conclusions of all other sciences: Next she discovers\r\nrespecting the notions which other sciences deal with, magnificent\r\ntruths to which these sciences of themselves can by no means attain:\r\nher Third dignity is, that she by her own power and without respect\r\nof other sciences, investigates the secrets of nature.' {520}\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\A: \"Veritates magnificas in terminis aliarum scientiarum in\r\nquas per nullam viam possunt illæ scientiæ, hæc sola scientiarum\r\ndomina speculativarum, potest dare.\"--_Op. Maj._ p. 465.]\r\n\r\n\"The examples which Bacon gives of these 'Prerogatives' are very\r\ncurious, exhibiting, among some error and credulity, sound and clear\r\nviews. His leading example of the First Prerogative is the Rainbow, of\r\nwhich the cause, as given by Aristotle, is tested by reference to\r\nexperiment with a skill which is, even to us now, truly admirable. The\r\nexamples of the Second Prerogative are three--_first_, the art of\r\nmaking an artificial sphere which shall move with the heavens by\r\nnatural influences, which Bacon trusts may be done, though astronomy\r\nherself cannot do it--'et tunc,' he says, 'thesaurum unius regis\r\nvaleret hoc instrumentum;'--_secondly_, the art of prolonging life,\r\nwhich experiment may teach, though medicine has no means of securing\r\nit except by regimen;[23\\A]--_thirdly_, the art of making gold finer\r\nthan fine gold, which goes beyond the power of alchemy. The Third\r\nPrerogative of experimental science, arts independent of the received\r\nsciences, is exemplified in many curious examples, many of them\r\nwhimsical traditions. Thus it is said that the character of a people\r\nmay be altered by altering the air.[24\\A] Alexander, it seems, applied\r\nto Aristotle to know whether he should exterminate certain nations\r\nwhich he had discovered, as being irreclaimably barbarous; to which\r\nthe philosopher replied, 'If you can alter their air, permit them to\r\nlive; if not, put them to death.' In this part, we find the suggestion\r\nthat the fire-works made by children, of saltpetre, might lead to the\r\ninvention of a formidable military weapon.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\A: One of the ingredients of a preparation here mentioned,\r\nis the flesh of a dragon, which, it appears, is used as food by the\r\nEthiopians. The mode of preparing this food cannot fail to amuse the\r\nreader. \"Where there are good flying dragons, by the art which they\r\npossess, they draw them out of their dens, and have bridles and\r\nsaddles in readiness, and they ride upon them, and make them bound\r\nabout in the air in a violent manner, that the hardness and\r\ntoughness of the flesh may be reduced, as boars are hunted and bulls\r\nare baited before they are killed for eating.\"--_Op. Maj._ p. 470.]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\A: _Op. Maj._ p. 472.]\r\n\r\n\"It could not be expected that Roger Bacon, at a time when\r\nexperimental science hardly existed, could give any _precepts_ for\r\nthe discovery of truth by experiment. But nothing can be a better\r\n_example_ of the method of such investigation, than his inquiry\r\nconcerning the cause of the Rainbow. Neither Aristotle, nor\r\nAvicenna, nor Seneca, he says, have given us any clear knowledge of\r\nthis matter, but experimental science can do so. Let the\r\nexperimenter (_experimentator_) consider the cases in which he finds\r\nthe same colors, as the hexagonal crystals from Ireland and India;\r\nby looking into these he will see colors like those of the rainbow.\r\nMany think that this arises from some {521} special virtue of these\r\nstones and their hexagonal figure; let therefore the experimenter go\r\non, and he will find the same in other transparent stones, in dark\r\nones as well as in light-colored. He will find the same effect also\r\nin other forms than the hexagon, if they be furrowed in the surface,\r\nas the Irish crystals are. Let him consider too, that he sees the\r\nsame colors in the drops which are dashed from oars in the\r\nsunshine;--and in the spray thrown by a mill wheel;--and in the dew\r\ndrops which lie on the grass in a meadow on a summer morning;--and\r\nif a man takes water in his mouth and projects it on one side into a\r\nsunbeam;--and if in an oil lamp hanging in the air, the rays fall in\r\ncertain positions upon the surface of the oil;--and in many other\r\nways, are colors produced. We have here a collection of instances,\r\nwhich are almost all examples of the same kind as the phenomenon\r\nunder consideration; and by the help of a principle collected by\r\ninduction from these facts, the colors of the rainbow were\r\nafterwards really explained.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the form and other circumstances of the bow he is\r\nstill more precise. He bids us measure the height of the bow and of\r\nthe sun, to show that the centre of the bow is exactly opposite to\r\nthe sun. He explains the circular form of the bow,--its being\r\nindependent of the form of the cloud, its moving when we move, its\r\nflying when we follow,--by its consisting of the reflections from a\r\nvast number of minute drops. He does not, indeed, trace the course\r\nof the rays through the drop, or account for the precise magnitude\r\nwhich the bow assumes; but he approaches to the verge of this part\r\nof the explanation; and must be considered as having given a most\r\nhappy example of experimental inquiry into nature, at a time when\r\nsuch examples were exceedingly scanty. In this respect, he was more\r\nfortunate than Francis Bacon, as we shall hereafter see.\r\n\r\n\"We know but little of the biography of Roger Bacon, but we have\r\nevery reason to believe that his influence upon his age was not\r\ngreat. He was suspected of magic, and is said to have been put into\r\nclose confinement in consequence of this charge. In his work he\r\nspeaks of Astrology, as a science well worth cultivating. 'But,'\r\nsays he, 'Theologians and Decretists, not being learned in such\r\nmatters, and seeing that evil as well as good may be done, neglect\r\nand abhor such things, and reckon them among Magic Arts.' We have\r\nalready seen, that at the very time when Bacon was thus raising his\r\nvoice against the habit of blindly following authority, and seeking\r\nfor all science in Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas was employed in\r\nfashioning Aristotle's tenets into that fixed form in which they\r\nbecame the great impediment to the {522} progress of knowledge. It\r\nwould seem, indeed, that something of a struggle between the\r\nprogressive and stationary powers of the human mind was going on at\r\nthis time. Bacon himself says,[25\\A] 'Never was there so great an\r\nappearance of wisdom, nor so much exercise of study in so many\r\nFaculties, in so many regions, as for this last forty years. Doctors\r\nare dispersed everywhere, in every castle, in every burgh, and\r\nespecially by the students of two Orders, (he means the Franciscans\r\nand Dominicans, who were almost the only religious orders that\r\ndistinguished themselves by an application to study,[26\\A]) which\r\nhas not happened except for about forty years. And yet there was\r\nnever so much ignorance, so much error.' And in the part of his work\r\nwhich refers to Mathematics, he says of that study,[27\\A] that it is\r\nthe door and the key of the sciences; and that the neglect of it for\r\nthirty or forty years has entirely ruined the studies of the Latins.\r\nAccording to these statements, some change, disastrous to the\r\nfortunes of science, must have taken place about 1230, soon after\r\nthe foundation of the Dominican and Franciscan Orders.[28\\A] Nor can\r\nwe doubt that the adoption of the Aristotelian philosophy by these\r\ntwo Orders, in the form in which the Angelical Doctor had\r\nsystematized it, was one of the events which most tended to defer,\r\nfor three centuries, the reform which Roger Bacon urged as a matter\r\nof crying necessity in his own time.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\A: Quoted by Jebb, Pref. to _Op.

I translate it from the edition\r\nof his book _De Docta Ignorantia_, from his works published at Basil\r\nin 1565. He praises _Learned Ignorance_--that is, Acknowledged\r\nIgnorance--as the source of knowledge. His ground for asserting the\r\nmotions of the earth is, that there is no such thing as perfect\r\nrest, or an exact centre, or a perfect circle, nor perfect\r\nuniformity of motion. \"Neque verus circulus dabilis est, quinetiam\r\nverior dari possit, neque unquam uno tempore sicut alio æqualiter\r\npræcisè, aut movetur, aut circulum veri similem, æqualem describit,\r\netiamsi nobis hoc non appareat. Et ubicumque quis fuerit, se in\r\ncentro esse credit.\" (Lib. i. cap. xi. p. 39.) He adds, \"The\r\nAncients did not attain to this knowledge, because they were wanting\r\nin Learned Ignorance. Now it is manifest to us that the Earth is\r\ntruly in motion, although this do not appear to us; since we do not\r\napprehend motion except by comparison with something fixed. For if\r\nany one were in a boat in the middle of a river, ignorant that the\r\nwater was flowing, and not seeing the banks, how could he apprehend\r\nthat the boat was moving? And thus since every one, whether he be in\r\nthe Earth, or in the Sun, or in any other star, thinks that he is in\r\nan immovable centre, and that everything else is moving; he would\r\nassign different poles for himself, others as being in the Sun,\r\nothers in the Earth, and others in the Moon, and so of the rest.\r\nWhence the machine of the world is as if it had its centre\r\neverywhere and its circumference nowhere.\" This train of thought\r\n{524} might be a preparation for the reception of the Copernican\r\nsystem; but it is very different from the doctrine that the Sun is\r\nthe centre of the Planetary Motions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE COPERNICAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Moon's Rotation._\r\n\r\nI HAVE said, in page 264, that a confusion of mind produced by the\r\ndouble reference of motion to absolute space, and to a centre of\r\nrevolution, often leads persons to dispute whether the Moon, while\r\nshe revolves about the Earth, always turning to it the same face,\r\nrevolves about her axis or not.\r\n\r\nThis dispute has been revived very lately, and has been conducted in\r\na manner which shows that popular readers and writers have made\r\nlittle progress in the clearness of their notions during the last\r\ntwo or three centuries; and that they have accepted the Newtonian\r\ndoctrines in words with a very dim apprehension of their real import.\r\n\r\nIf the Moon were carried round the Earth by a rigid arm revolving\r\nabout the Earth as a centre, being rigidly fastened to this arm, as\r\na mimic Moon might be, in a machine constructed to represent her\r\nmotions, this contrivance, while it made her revolve round the Earth\r\nwould make her also turn the same face to the Earth: and if we were\r\nto make such a machine the standard example of rotation, the Moon\r\nmight be said not to rotate on her axis.\r\n\r\nBut we are speedily led to endless confusion by taking this case as\r\nthe standard of rotation. For the selection of the centre of\r\nrotation in a system which includes several bodies is arbitrary. The\r\nMoon turns all her faces successively to the Sun, and therefore with\r\nregard to the Sun, she does rotate on her axis; and yet she revolves\r\nround the Sun as truly as she revolves round the Earth. And the only\r\nreally simple and consistent mode of speaking of rotation, is to\r\nrefer the motion not to any relative centre, but to absolute space.\r\n\r\nThis is the argument merely on the ground of simplicity and\r\nconsistency. But we find physical reasons, as well as mathematical,\r\nfor referring the motion to absolute space. If a cup of water be\r\ncarried round a centre so as to describe a circle, a straw floating\r\non the surface {525} of the water, if it point to the centre of the\r\ncircle at first, does not continue to do so, but remains parallel to\r\nitself during the whole revolution. Now there is no cause to make\r\nthe water (and therefore the straw) rotate on its axis; and\r\ntherefore it is not a clear or convenient way of speaking, to say\r\nthat the water in this case does revolve on its axis. But if the\r\nwater in this case do not revolve on its axis, a body in the case of\r\nthe Moon does revolve on its axis.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, as I have said in the text, is of the same nature as\r\nthat which the Copernicans at first found in the parallel motion of\r\nthe Earth's axis. In order to make the axis of the Earth's rotation\r\nremain parallel to itself while the Earth revolves about the Sun, in\r\na mechanical representation, some machinery is needed _in addition_ to\r\nthe machinery which produces the revolution round the centre (the\r\nSun): but the simplest way of regarding the parallel motion is, to\r\nconceive that the axis has no motion except that which carries it\r\nround the central Sun. And it was seen, when the science of\r\nMechanics was established, that no force was needed in nature to\r\nproduce this parallelism of the Earth's axis. It was therefore the\r\nonly scientific course, to conceive this parallelism as not being a\r\nrotation: and in like manner we are to conceive the parallelism of a\r\nrevolving body as not being a rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_M. Foucault's Proofs of the Earth's Motion._\r\n\r\nIT was hardly to be expected that we should discover, in our own\r\nday, a new physical proof of the earth's motion, yet so it has been.\r\nThe experiments of M. Foucault have enabled us to see the Rotation\r\nof the Earth on its axis, as taking place, we may say, before our\r\neyes. These experiments are, in fact, a result of what has been said\r\nin speaking of the Moon's rotation: namely, That the mechanical\r\ncauses of motion operate with reference to absolute, not relative,\r\nspace; so that where there is no cause operating to change a motion,\r\nit will retain its direction in _absolute_ space; and may on that\r\naccount seem to change, if regarded relatively in a _limited_ space.\r\n\r\nIn M. Foucault's first experiment, the motion employed was that of a\r\npendulum. If a pendulum oscillate quite freely, there is no cause\r\nacting to change the vertical plane of oscillation _absolutely_; for\r\nthe forces which produce the oscillation are _in_ the vertical\r\nplane. But if the vertical plane remain the same _absolutely_, at a\r\nspot on the surface of the revolving Earth, it will change\r\n_relatively_ to the spectator. He will see the pendulum oscillate in\r\na vertical plane which gradually {526} turns away from its first\r\nposition. Now this is what really happens; and thus the revolution\r\nof the Earth in absolute space is experimentally proved.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent experiments, M. Foucault has used the rotation of a\r\nbody to prove the same thing. For when a body rotates freely, acted\r\nupon by no power, there is nothing to change the position of the\r\naxis of rotation in absolute space. But if the position of the axis\r\nremain the same in absolute space, it will, in virtue of its\r\nrelative motion, change as seen by a spectator at any spot on the\r\nrotating Earth. By taking a heavy disk or globe and making it rotate\r\non its axis rapidly, the force of absolute permanence (as compared\r\nwith the inevitable casual disturbances arising from the machinery\r\nwhich supports the revolving disk) becomes considerable  and hence\r\nthe relative motion can, in this way also, be made visible.\r\n\r\nMr. De Morgan has said (_Comp. to Brit. Alm._ 1836, p. 18) that\r\nastronomy does not supply any argument for the earth's motion which\r\nis absolutely and demonstrably conclusive, till we come to the\r\nAberration of Light. But we may now venture to say that the\r\nexperiments of M. Foucault prove the diurnal motion of the Earth in\r\nthe most conclusive manner, by palpable and broad effects, if we\r\naccept the doctrines of the Science of Mechanics: while Aberration\r\nproves the annual motion, if we suppose that we can observe the\r\nplaces of the fixed stars to the accuracy of a few seconds; and if\r\nwe accept, in addition to the doctrines of Mechanics, the doctrine\r\nof the motion of light with a certain great velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO COPERNICUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_English Copernicans._\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR DE MORGAN has made numerous and interesting contributions\r\nto the history of the progress and reception of the Copernican\r\nSystem. These are given mainly in the _Companion to the British\r\nAlmanac_; especially in his papers entitled \"Old Arguments against\r\nthe Motion of the Earth\" (1836); \"English Mathematical and\r\nAstronomical Writers\" (1837); \"On the Difficulty of Correct {527}\r\nDescription of Books\" (1853); \"The Progress of the Doctrine of the\r\nEarth's Motion between the Times of Copernicus and Galileo\" (1855).\r\nIn these papers he insists very rightly upon the distinction between\r\nthe _mathematical_ and the _physical_ aspect of the doctrines of\r\nCopernicus: a distinction corresponding very nearly with the\r\ndistinction which we have drawn between Formal and Physical\r\nAstronomy; and in accordance with which we have given the history of\r\nthe Heliocentric Doctrine as a Formal Theory in Book v., and as a\r\nPhysical Theory in Book vii.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting part of Mr. De Morgan's researches are the\r\nnotices which he has given of the early assertors of the\r\nheliocentric doctrine in England. These make their appearance as\r\nsoon as it was well possible they should exist. The work of\r\nCopernicus was published, as we have said, in 1543. In September\r\n1556, John Field published an Ephemeris for 1557, \"juxta Copernici\r\net Reinholdi Canones,\" in the preface to which he avows his\r\nconviction of the truth of the Copernican hypothesis. Robert\r\nRecorde, the author of various works on Arithmetic, published among\r\nothers, \"The Pathway to Knowledge\" in 1551. In this book, the author\r\ndiscusses the question of the \"quietnes of the earth,\" and professes\r\nto leave it undecided: but Mr. De Morgan (_Comp. A._ 1837, p. 33)\r\nconceives that it appears from what is said, that he was really a\r\nCopernican, but did not think the world ripe for any such doctrine.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Hunter also has brought to notice[29\\A] the claims of\r\nField, whom he designates as the _Proto-Copernican_ of England. He\r\nquotes the Address to the Reader prefixed to his first _Ephemeris_,\r\nand dated May 31, 1556, in which he says that, since abler men\r\ndecline the task, \"I have therefore published this Ephemeris of the\r\nyear 1557, following in it as my authorities, N. Copernicus and\r\nErasmus Reinhold, whose writings are established and founded on\r\ntrue, certain, and authentic demonstrations.\" I conceive that this\r\npassage, however, only shows that Field had adopted the Copernican\r\nscheme as a basis for the calculation of Ephemerides; which, as Mr.\r\nDe Morgan has remarked, is a very different thing from accepting it\r\nas a physical truth. Field, in this same address, makes mention of\r\nthe errors \"illius turbæ quæ Alphonsi utitur hypothesi;\" but the\r\nword _hypothesis_ is still indecisive.\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\A: _Ast. Soc. Notices_, vol. iii. p. 3 (1833).]\r\n\r\nAs evidence that Field was regarded in his own day as a man who\r\n{528} had rendered good service to science, Mr. Hunter notices that,\r\nin 1558, the Heralds granted to him the right of using, with his\r\narms, the crest or additional device of a red right arm issuing from\r\nthe clouds, and presenting a golden armillary sphere.\r\n\r\nRecorde's claims depend upon a passage in a Dialogue between\r\n_Master_ and _Scholar_, in which the Master expounds the doctrine of\r\nCopernicus, and the authorities against it; to which the Scholar\r\nanswers, taking the common view: \"Nay, sir, in good faith I desire\r\nnot to hear such vaine phantasies, so far against common reason, and\r\nrepugnant to all the learned multitude of wryters, and therefore let\r\nit passe for ever and a day longer.\" The Master, more sagely, warns\r\nhim against a hasty judgment, and says, \"Another time I will so\r\ndeclare his supposition, that you shall not only wonder to hear it,\r\nbut also peradventure be as earnest then to credit it, as you now\r\nare now to condemne it.\" I conceive that this passage proves Mr. De\r\nMorgan's assertion, that Recorde was a Copernican, and very likely\r\nthe first in England.\r\n\r\nIn 1555, also, Leonard Digges published his \"Prognostication\r\nEverlasting;\" but this is, as Mr. De Morgan says (_Comp. A._ 1837, p.\r\n40) a meteorological work. It was republished in 1592 by his son\r\nThomas Digges with additions; and as these have been the occasion of\r\nsome confusion among those who have written on the history of\r\nastronomy, I am glad to be able, through the kindness of Professor\r\nWalker of Oxford, to give a distinct account of the editions of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn the Bodleian Library, besides the editions of 1555 and 1592 of\r\nthe \"Prognostication Everlasting,\" there is an edition of 1564. It\r\nis still decidedly Ptolemaic, and contains a Diagram representing a\r\nnumber of concentric circles, which are marked, in order, as--\r\n\"The Earth,\r\n     Moone,\r\n     Venus,\r\n     Mercury,\r\n     Sunne,\r\n     Mars,\r\n     Jupiter,\r\n     Saturne,\r\n The Starrie Firmament,\r\n The Crystalline Heavens,\r\n The First Mover,\r\n The Abode of God and the Elect. Here the Learned do approve.\" {529}\r\n\r\nThe third edition, of 1592, contains an Addition, by the son, of\r\ntwenty pages. He there speaks of having found, apparently among his\r\nfather's papers, \"A description or modile of the world and situation\r\nof Spheres Cœlestiall and elementare according to the doctrine of\r\nPtolemie, whereunto all universities (led thereunto chiefly by the\r\nauthoritie of Aristotle) do consent.\" He adds: \"But in this our age,\r\none rare witte (seeing the continuall errors that from time to time\r\nmore and more continually have been discovered, besides the infinite\r\nabsurdities in their Theoricks, which they have been forced to admit\r\nthat would not confesse any Mobilitie in the ball of the Earth) hath\r\nby long studye, paynfull practise, and rare invention, delivered a\r\nnew Theorick or Model of the world, shewing that the Earth resteth\r\nnot in the Center of the whole world or globe of elements, which\r\nencircled and enclosed in the Moone's orbe, and together with the\r\nwhole globe of mortalitye is carried yearely round about the Sunne,\r\nwhich like a king in the middest of all, raygneth and giveth lawes\r\nof motion to all the rest, sphærically dispersing his glorious\r\nbeames of light through all this sacred cœlestiall Temple. And the\r\nEarth itselfe to be one of the Planets, having his peculiar and\r\nstrange courses, turning every 24 hours rounde upon his owne centre,\r\nwhereby the Sunne and great globe of fixed Starres seem to sway\r\nabout and turne, albeit indeed they remaine fixed--So many ways is\r\nthe sense of mortal man abused.\"\r\n\r\nThis Addition is headed:\r\n\"A Perfit Description of the Cœlestiall Orbes, according to the most\r\nancient doctrine of the Pythagoreans: lately revived by Copernicus,\r\nand by Geometrical Demonstrations approved.\" Mr. De Morgan, not\r\nhaving seen this edition, and knowing the title-page only as far as\r\nthe word \"Pythagoreans,\" says \"their _astrological_ doctrines we\r\npresume, not their reputed _Copernican_ ones.\" But it now appears\r\nthat in this, as in other cases, the authority of the Pythagoreans\r\nwas claimed for the Copernican system. Antony a Wood quotes the\r\nlatter part of the title thus: \"Cui subnectitur _orbium_\r\nCopernicarum accurata descriptio;\" which is inaccurate. Weidler,\r\nstill more inaccurately, cites it, \"Cui subnectitur _operum_\r\nCopernici accurata descriptio.\" Lalande goes still further,\r\nattempting, it would seem, to recover the English title-page from\r\nthe Latin: we find in the _Bibl. Astron._ the following: \"1592 . .\r\nLeonard Digges, Accurate Description of the Copernican System to the\r\nAstronomical perpetual Prognostication.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Digges appears, by others also of his writings, to have been\r\n{530} a clear and decided Copernican. In his \"Alæ sive Scalæ\r\nMathematicæ,\" 1573, he bestows high praise upon Copernicus and upon\r\nhis system: and appears to have been a believer in the real motion\r\nof the Earth, and not merely an admirer of the system of Copernicus\r\nas an explanatory hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Giordano Bruno._\r\n\r\nThe complete title of the work referred to is:\r\n\r\n\"Jordani Bruni Nolani De Monade Numero et Figura liber consequens\r\nQuinque De Minimo Magno et Mensura, item De Innumerabilibus, Immenso\r\net Infigurabili; seu De Universo et Mundis libri octo. (Francofurti,\r\n1591.)\"\r\n\r\nThat the Reader may judge of the value of Bruno's speculations, I\r\ngive the following quotations:\r\n\r\nLib. iv. c. 11 (Index). \"Tellurem totam habitabilem esse _intus_ et\r\nextra, et innumerabilia animantium complecti tum nobis sensibilium\r\ntum _occultorum_ genera.\"\r\n\r\nC. 13. \"Ut Mundorum Synodi in Universo et particulares Mundi in\r\nSynodis ordinentur,' &c.\r\n\r\nHe says (Lib. v. c. 1, p. 461): \"Besides the stars and the great\r\nworlds there are smaller living creatures carried through the\r\netherial space, in the form of a small sphere which has the aspect\r\nof a bright fire, and is by the vulgar regarded as a fiery beam.\r\nThey are below the clouds, and I saw one which seemed to touch the\r\nroofs of the houses. Now this sphere, or beam as they call it, was\r\nreally a living creature (_animal_), which I once saw moving in a\r\nstraight path, and grazing as it were the roofs of the city of Nola,\r\nas if it were going to impinge on Mount Cicada; which however it\r\nwent over.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two recent editions of the works of Giordano Bruno; by\r\nAdolf Wagner, Leipsick, 1830, in two volumes; and by Gfrörer,\r\nBerlin, 1833. Of the latter I do not know that more than one volume\r\n(vol. ii.) has appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Did Francis Bacon reject the Copernican System?_\r\n\r\nMR. DE MORGAN has very properly remarked (_Comp. B. A._ 1855, p. 11)\r\nthat the notice of the heliocentric question in the _Novum Organon_\r\nmust be considered one of the most important passages in his works\r\nupon this point, as being probably the latest written and best {531}\r\nmatured. It occurs in Lib. ii. Aphorism xxxvi., in which he is\r\nspeaking of _Prerogative Instances_, of which he gives twenty-seven\r\nspecies. In the passage now referred to, he is speaking of a kind of\r\nPrerogative Instances, better known to ordinary readers than most of\r\nthe kinds by name, the _Instantia Crucis_: though probably the\r\nmetaphor from which this name is derived is commonly wrongly\r\napprehended. Bacon's meaning is _Guide-Post Instances_: and the\r\n_Crux_ which he alludes to is not a Cross, but a Guide-Post at\r\nCross-roads. And among the cases to which such Instances may be\r\napplied, he mentions the diurnal motion of the heavens from east to\r\nwest, and the special motion of the particular heavenly bodies from\r\nwest to east. And he suggests what he conceives may be an _Instantia\r\nCrucis_ in each case. If, he says, we find any motion from east to\r\nwest in the bodies which surround the earth, slow in the ocean,\r\nquicker in the air, quicker still in comets, gradually quicker in\r\nplanets according to their greater distance from the earth: _then_ we\r\nmay suppose that there is a cosmical diurnal motion, and the motion\r\nof the earth must be denied.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the special motions of the heavenly bodies, he first\r\nremarks that each body not coming quite so far westwards as before,\r\nafter one revolution of the heavens, and going to the north or the\r\nsouth, does not imply any special motion; since it may be accounted\r\nfor by a modification of the diurnal motion in each, which produces\r\na defect of the return, and a spiral path; and he says that if we\r\nlook at the matter as common people[30\\A] and disregard the devices\r\nof astronomers, the motion is really so to the senses; and that he\r\nhas made an imitation of it by means of wires. The _instantia\r\ncrucis_ which he here suggests is, to see if we can find in any\r\ncredible history an account of any comet which did not share in the\r\ndiurnal revolution of the skies.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\A: Et certissimum est si paulisper pro plebeiis nos geramus\r\n(missis astronomorum et scholæ commentis, quibus illud in more est,\r\nut sensui in multis immerito vim faciant et obscuriora malint) talem\r\nesse motum istum ad sensum qualem diximus.]\r\n\r\nOn his assertion that the motion of each separate planet is, to\r\nsense, a spiral, we may remark that it is certainly true; but that\r\nthe business of science, here, as elsewhere, consists in _resolving_\r\nthe complex phenomenon into simple phenomena; the complex spiral\r\nmotion into simple circular motions.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the diurnal motion of the earth, it would seem as if\r\nBacon himself had a leaning to believe it when he wrote this\r\npassage; for neither is he himself, nor are any of the\r\nAnticopernicans, {532} accustomed to assert that the immensely rapid\r\nmotion of the sphere of the Fixed Stars graduates by a slower and\r\nslower motion of Planets, Comets, Air, and Ocean, into the\r\nimmobility of the Earth. So that the conditions are not satisfied on\r\nwhich he hypothetically says, \"tum abnegandus est motus terræ.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proper motions of the planets, this passage seems\r\nto me to confirm what I have already said of him; that he does not\r\nappear to have seen the full value and meaning of what had been\r\ndone, up to his time, in Formal Astronomy.\r\n\r\nWe may however fully agree with Mr. De Morgan; that the whole of\r\nwhat he has said on this subject, when put together, does not\r\njustify Hume's assertion that he rejected the Copernican system\r\n\"with the most positive disdain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. De Morgan, in order to balance the Copernican argument derived\r\nfrom the immense velocity of the stars in their diurnal velocity on\r\nthe other supposition, has reminded us that those who reject this\r\ngreat velocity as improbable, accept without scruple the greater\r\nvelocity of light. It is curious that Bacon also has made this\r\ncomparison, though using it for a different purpose; namely, to show\r\nthat the transmission of the visual impression may be instantaneous.\r\nIn Aphorism xlvi. of Book ii. of the _Novum Organon_ he is speaking\r\nof what he calls _Instantiæ curriculi_, or _Instantiæ ad aquam_,\r\nwhich we may call _Instances by the clock_: and he says that the\r\ngreat velocity of the diurnal sphere makes the marvellous velocity\r\nof the rays of light more credible.\r\n\r\n\"Immensa illa velocitas in ipso corpore, quæ cernitur in motu diurno\r\n(quæ etiam viros graves ita obstupefecit ut _mallent credere motum\r\nterræ_), facit motum illum ejaculationis ab ipsis [stellis] (licet\r\nceleritate ut diximus admirabilem) magis credibilem.\" This passage\r\nshows an inclination towards the opinion of the earth's being at\r\nrest, but not a very strong conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kepler persecuted._\r\n\r\nWE have seen (p. 280) that Kepler writes to Galileo in 1597--\"Be\r\ntrustful and go forwards. If Italy is not a convenient place for the\r\npublication of your views, and if you are likely to meet with any\r\nobstacles, perhaps Germany will grant us the necessary liberty.\"\r\nKepler however had soon afterwards occasion to learn that in Germany\r\nalso, the cultivators of science were exposed to persecution. It is\r\ntrue that {533} in his case the persecution went mainly on the broad\r\nground of his being a Protestant, and extended to great numbers of\r\npersons at that time. The circumstances of this and other portions of\r\nKepler's life have been brought to light only recently through an\r\nexamination of public documents in the Archives of Würtemberg and\r\nunpublished letters of Kepler. (Johann Keppler's Leben und Wirken,\r\nnach neuerlich aufgefundenen Manuscripten bearbeitet von J. L. C.\r\nFreiherrn v. Breitschwart, K. Würtemberg. Staats-Rath. Stuttgart,\r\n1831.)\r\n\r\nSchiller, in his _History of the Thirty Years' War_, says that when\r\nFerdinand of Austria succeeded to the Archduchy of Stiria, and found\r\na great number of Protestants among his subjects, he suppressed\r\ntheir public worship without cruelty and almost without noise. But\r\nit appears now that the Protestants were treated with great\r\nseverity. Kepler held a professorship in Stiria, and had married, in\r\n1507, Barbara Müller, who had landed property in that province. On\r\nthe 11th of June, 1598, he writes to his friend Mæstlin that the\r\narrival of the Prince out of Italy is looked forwards to with\r\nterror. In December he writes that the Protestants had irritated the\r\nCatholics by attacks from the pulpit and by caricatures; that\r\nhereupon the Prince, at the prayer of the Estates, had declared the\r\nLetter of License granted by his father to be forfeited, and had\r\nordered all the Evangelical Teachers to leave the country on pain of\r\ndeath. They went to the frontiers of Hungary and Croatia; but after\r\na month, Kepler was allowed to return, on condition of keeping\r\nquiet. His discoveries appear to have operated in his favor. But the\r\nnext year he found his situation in Stiria intolerable, and longed\r\nto return to his native country of Würtemberg, and to find some\r\nposition there. This he did not obtain. He wrote a circular letter\r\nto his Brother Protestants, to give them consolation and courage;\r\nand this was held to be a violation of the conditions on which his\r\nresidence was tolerated. Fortunately, at this time he was invited to\r\njoin Tycho Brahe, who had also been driven from his native country,\r\nand was living at Prague. The two astronomers worked together under\r\nthe patronage of the Emperor Rudolph II.; and when Tycho died in\r\n1601, Kepler became the Imperial _Mathematicus_.\r\n\r\nWe are not to imagine that even among Protestants, astronomical\r\nnotions were out of the sphere of religious considerations. When\r\nKepler was established in Stiria, his first official business was\r\nthe calculation of the Calendar for the Evangelical Community. They\r\nprotested against the new Calendar, as manifestly calculated for the\r\nfurtherance of an impious papistry: and, say they, \"We hold the Pope\r\nfor a {534} horrible roaring Lion. If we take his Calendar, we must\r\nneeds go into the church when he rings us in.\" Kepler however did\r\nnot fail to see, and to say, that the Papal Reformation of the\r\nCalendar was a vast improvement.\r\n\r\nKepler, as court-astronomer, was of course required to provide such\r\nobservations of the heavens as were requisite for the calculations of\r\nthe Astrologers. That he considered Astrology to be valuable only as\r\nthe nurse of Astronomy, he did not hesitate to reveal. He wrote a work\r\nwith a title of which the following is the best translation which I\r\ncan give: \"_Tertius interveniens_, or: A Warning to certain\r\n_Theologi_, _Medici_, _Philosophi_, that while they reasonably reject\r\nstar-gazing superstition, they do not throw away the kernel with the\r\nshell.[31\\A] 1610.\" In this he says, \"You over-clever Philosophers\r\nblame this Daughter of Astronomy more than is reasonable. Do you not\r\nknow that she must maintain her mother with her charms? How many men\r\nwould be able to make Astronomy their business, if men did not cherish\r\nthe hope to read the Future in the skies?\"\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\A: The German passage involves a curious image, borrowed, I\r\nsuppose, from some odd story: \"dass sie mit billiger Verwerfung des\r\nsternguckerischen Aberglaubens das Kind nicht mit dem Bade\r\nausschütten.\" \"That they do not throw away the child along with the\r\ndirty water of his bath.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Were the Papal Edicts against the Copernican System repealed?_\r\n\r\nADMIRAL SMYTH, in his _Cycle of Celestial Objects_, vol. i. p. 65,\r\nsays--\"At length, in 1818, the voice of truth was so prevailing that\r\nPius VII. repealed the edicts against the Copernican system, and\r\nthus, in the emphatic words of Cardinal Toriozzi, 'wiped off this\r\nscandal from the Church.'\"\r\n\r\nA like story is referred to by Sir Francis Palgrave, in his\r\nentertaining and instructive fiction, _The Merchant and the Friar_.\r\n\r\nHaving made inquiry of persons most likely to be well informed on\r\nthis subject, I have not been able to learn that there is any\r\nfurther foundation for these statements than this: In 1818, on the\r\nrevisal of the _Index Expurgatorius_, Galileo's writings were, after\r\nsome opposition, expunged from that Catalogue.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Marino Marini, an eminent Roman Prelate, had addressed to\r\nthe _Romana Accademia di Archeologia_, certain historico-critical\r\nMemoirs, which he published in 1850, with the title _Galileo e\r\nl'Inquisizione_. In these, he confirms the conclusion which, I\r\nthink, almost {535} all persons who have studied the facts have\r\narrived at;[32\\A] that Galileo trifled with authority to which he\r\nprofessed to submit, and was punished for obstinate contumacy, not\r\nfor heresy. M. Marini renders full justice to Galileo's ability, and\r\ndoes not at all hesitate to regard his scientific attainments as\r\namong the glories of Italy. He quotes, what Galileo himself quoted,\r\nan expression of Cardinal Baronius, that \"the intention of the Holy\r\nSpirit was to teach how to go to heaven, not how heaven goes.\"[33\\A]\r\nHe shows that Galileo pleaded (p. 62) that he had not held the\r\nCopernican opinion after it had been intimated to him (by Bellarmine\r\nin 1616), that he was not to hold it; and that his breach of promise\r\nin this respect was the cause of the proceedings against him.\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\A: M. Marini (p. 29) mentions Leibnitz, Guizot, Spittler,\r\nEichhorn, Raumer, Ranke, among the \"storici eterodossi\" who have at\r\nlast done justice to the Roman Church.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\A: Come si vada al Cielo, e non come vada il Cielo.]\r\n\r\nThose who admire Galileo and regard him as a martyr because, after\r\nescaping punishment by saying \"It _does not_ move,\" he forthwith\r\nsaid \"And yet it _does_ move,\" will perhaps be interested to know\r\nthat the former answer was suggested to him by friends anxious for\r\nhis safety. Niccolini writes to Bali Cioli (April 9, 1633) that\r\nGalileo continued to be so persuaded of the truth of his opinions\r\nthat \"he was resolved (some moments before his sentence) to defend\r\nthem stoutly; but I (continues Niccolini) exhorted him to make an\r\nend of this; not to mind defending them; and to submit himself to\r\nthat which he sees that they may desire him to believe or to hold\r\nabout this matter of the motion of the earth. He was extremely\r\nafflicted.\" But the Inquisition was satisfied with his answers, and\r\nrequired no more.[34\\A]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\A: Marini, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{536}}\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nMECHANICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Significance of Analytical Mechanics._\r\n\r\nIN the text, page 372, I have stated that Lagrange, near the end of\r\nhis life, expressed his sorrow that the methods of approximation\r\nemployed in Physical Astronomy rested on arbitrary processes, and\r\nnot on any insight into the results of mechanical action. From the\r\nrecent biography of Gauss, the greatest physical mathematician of\r\nmodern times, we learn that he congratulated himself on having\r\nescaped this error. He remarked[35\\A] that many of the most\r\ncelebrated mathematicians, Euler very often, Lagrange sometimes, had\r\ntrusted too much to the symbolical calculation of their problems,\r\nand would not have been able to give an account of the meaning of\r\neach successive step of their investigation. He said that he\r\nhimself, on the other hand, could assert that at every step which he\r\ntook, he always had the aim and purpose of his operations before his\r\neyes without ever turning aside from the way. The same, he remarked,\r\nmight be said of Newton.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\A: Gauss, _Zum Gedächtniss, von W. Sartorius v.\r\nWaltershausen_, p. 80.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Engineering Mechanics._\r\n\r\nThe principles of the science of Mechanics were discovered by\r\nobservations made upon bodies within the reach of men; as we have\r\nseen in speaking of the discoveries of Stevinus, Galileo, and\r\nothers, up to the time of Newton. And when there arose the\r\ncontroversy about _vis viva_ (Chap. v. Sect. 2 of this\r\nBook);--namely, whether the \"living force\" of a body is measured by\r\nthe product of the weight into the {537} velocity, or of the weight\r\ninto the square of the velocity;--still the examples taken were\r\ncases of action in machines and the like terrestrial objects. But\r\nNewton's discoveries identified celestial with terrestrial\r\nmechanics; and from that time the mechanical problems of the heavens\r\nbecame more important and attractive to mathematicians than the\r\nproblems about earthly machines. And thus the generalizations of the\r\nproblems, principles, and methods of the mathematical science of\r\nMechanics from this period are principally those which have\r\nreference to the motions of the heavenly bodies: such as the Problem\r\nof Three Bodies, the Principles of the Conservation of Areas, and of\r\nthe Immovable Plane, the Method of Variation of Parameters, and the\r\nlike (Chap. vi. Sect. 7 and 14). And the same is the case in the\r\nmore recent progress of that subject, in the hands of Gauss, Bessel,\r\nHansen, and others.\r\n\r\nBut yet the science of Mechanics as applied to terrestrial\r\nmachines--_Industrial Mechanics_, as it has been termed--has made\r\nsome steps which it may be worth while to notice, even in a general\r\nhistory of science. For the most part, all the most general laws of\r\nmechanical action being already finally established, in the way\r\nwhich we have had to narrate, the determination of the results and\r\nconditions of any combination of materials and movements becomes\r\nreally a mathematical deduction from known principles. But such\r\ndeductions may be made much more easy and much more luminous by the\r\nestablishment of general terms and general propositions suited to\r\ntheir special conditions. Among these I may mention a new abstract\r\nterm, introduced because a general mechanical principle can be\r\nexpressed by means of it, which has lately been much employed by the\r\nmathematical engineers of France, MM. Poncelet, Navier, Morin, &c.\r\nThe abstract term is _Travail_, which has been translated _Laboring\r\nForce_; and the principle which gives it its value, and makes it\r\nuseful in the solution of problems, is this;--that the _work done_\r\n(in overcoming resistance or producing any other effect) is equal to\r\nthe _Laboring Force_, by whatever contrivances the force be applied.\r\nThis is not a new principle, being in fact mathematically equivalent\r\nto the conservation of Vis Viva; but it has been employed by the\r\nmathematicians of whom I have spoken with a fertility and simplicity\r\nwhich make it the mark of a new school of _The Mechanics of\r\nEngineering_.\r\n\r\nThe Laboring Force expended and the work done have been described by\r\nvarious terms, as _Theoretical Effect_ and _Practical Effect_, and\r\nthe like. The usual term among English engineers for the work {538}\r\nwhich an Engine usually does, is _Duty_; but as this word naturally\r\nsignifies what the engine _ought_ to do, rather than what it does,\r\nwe should at least distinguish between the Theoretical and the\r\nActual Duty.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Theoretical and Actual Duty of a Machine\r\narises from this: that a portion of the Laboring Force is absorbed\r\nin producing effects, that is, in doing work which is not reckoned\r\nas Duty: for instance, overcoming the resistance and waste of the\r\nmachine itself. And so long as this resistance and waste are not\r\nrightly estimated, no correspondence can be established between the\r\ntheoretical and the practical Duty. Though much had been written\r\npreviously upon the theory of the steam-engine, the correspondence\r\nbetween the Force expended and the Work done was not clearly made\r\nout till Comte De Pambour published his _Treatise on Locomotive\r\nEngines_ in 1835, and his _Theory of the Steam-Engine_ in 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strength of Materials._\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects which have specially engaged the attention of\r\nthose who have applied the science of Mechanics to practical\r\nmatters, is the strength of materials: for example, the strength of\r\na horizontal beam to resist being broken by a weight pressing upon\r\nit. This was one of the problems which Galileo took up. He was led\r\nto his study of it by a visit which he made to the arsenal and\r\ndockyards of Venice, and the conclusions which he drew were\r\npublished in his _Dialogues_, in 1633. In his mode of regarding the\r\nproblem, he considers the section at which the beam breaks as the\r\nshort arm of a bent lever which resists fracture, and the part of\r\nthe beam which is broken off as the longer arm of the lever, the\r\nlever turning about the fracture as a hinge. So far this is true;\r\nand from this principle he obtained results which are also true  as,\r\nthat the strength of a rectangular beam is proportional to the\r\nbreadth multiplied into the square of the depth:--that a hollow beam\r\nis stronger than a solid beam of the same mass; and the like.\r\n\r\nBut he erred in this, that he supposed the hinge about which the\r\nbreaking beam turns, to be exactly at the unrent surface, that\r\nsurface resisting all change, and the beam being rent all the way\r\nacross. Whereas the fact is, that the unrent surface yields to\r\ncompression, while the opposite surface is rent; and the hinge about\r\nwhich the breaking beam turns is at an intermediate point, where the\r\nextension {539} and rupture end, and the compression and crushing\r\nbegin: a point which has been called _the neutral axis_. This was\r\npointed out by Mariotte; and the notion, once suggested, was so\r\nmanifestly true that it was adopted by mathematicians in general.\r\nJames Bernoulli,[36\\A] in 1705, investigated the strength of beams\r\non this view; and several eminent mathematicians pursued the\r\nsubject; as Varignon, Parent, and Bulfinger; and at a later period,\r\nDr. Robison in our own country.\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\A: _Opera_, ii. p. 976.]\r\n\r\nBut along with the fracture of beams, the mathematicians considered\r\nalso another subject, the flexure of beams, which they undergo\r\nbefore they break, in virtue of their elasticity. What is the\r\n_elastic curve_?--the curve into which an elastic line forms itself\r\nunder the pressure of a weight--is a problem which had been proposed\r\nby Galileo, and was fully solved, as a mathematical problem, by\r\nEuler and others.\r\n\r\nBut beams in practice are not mere lines: they are solids. And their\r\nresistance to flexure, and the amount of it, depends upon the\r\nresistance of their internal parts to extension and compression, and\r\nis different for different substances. To measure these differences,\r\nDr. Thomas Young introduced the notion of the _Modulus of\r\nElasticity_:[37\\A] meaning thereby a column of the substance of the\r\nsame diameter, such as would by its weight produce a compression\r\nequal to the whole length of the beam, the rate of compression being\r\nsupposed to continue the same throughout. Thus if a rod of any kind,\r\n100 inches long, were compressed 1 inch by a weight 1000 pounds, the\r\nweight of its modulus of elasticity would be 100,000 pounds. This\r\nnotion assumes Hooke's law that the extension of a substance is as\r\nits tension; and extends this law to compression also.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\A: Lecture xiii. The height of the modulus is the same for\r\nthe same substance, whatever its breadth and thickness may be; for\r\natmospheric air it is about five miles, and for steel nearly 1500\r\nmiles.]\r\n\r\nThere is this great advantage in introducing the definition of the\r\nModulus of Elasticity,--that it applies equally to the flexure of a\r\nsubstance and to the minute vibrations which propagate sound, and\r\nthe like. And the notion was applied so as to lead to curious and\r\nimportant results with regard to the power of beams to resist\r\nflexure, not only when loaded transversely, but when pressed in the\r\ndirection of their length, and in any oblique direction.\r\n\r\nBut in the fracture of beams, the resistance to extension and to\r\ncompression are not practically equal; and it was necessary to\r\ndetermine {540} the difference of these two forces by experiments.\r\nSeveral persons pursued researches on this subject; especially Mr.\r\nBarlow, of the Royal Military Academy,[38\\A] who investigated the\r\nsubject with great labor and skill, so far as wood is concerned. But\r\nthe difference between the resistance to tension and to compression\r\nrequires more special study in the case of iron; and has been\r\nespecially attended to in recent times, in consequence of the vast\r\nincrease in the number of iron structures, and in particular,\r\nrailways. It appears that wrought iron yields to compressive\r\nsomewhat more easily than to tensile force, while cast iron yields\r\nfar more easily to tensile than to compressive strains. In all cases\r\nthe power of a beam to resist fracture resides mainly in the upper\r\nand the under side, for there the tenacity of the material acts at\r\nthe greatest leverage round the hinge of fracture. Hence the\r\npractice was introduced of making iron beams with a broad _flange_\r\nat the upper and another flange at the under side, connected by a\r\nvertical plate or _web_, of which the office was to keep the two\r\nflanges asunder. Mr. Hodgkinson made many valuable experiments, on a\r\nlarge scale, to determine the forms and properties of such beams.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\A: _An Essay on the Strength and Shape of Timber_. 3d\r\nedition, 1826.]\r\n\r\nBut though engineers were, by such experiments and reasonings,\r\nenabled to calculate the strength of a given iron beam, and the\r\ndimensions of a beam which should bear a given load, it would hardly\r\nhave occurred to the boldest speculator, a few years ago, to predict\r\nthat there might be constructed beams nearly 500 feet long, resting\r\nmerely on their two extremities, of which it could be known\r\nbeforehand, that they would sustain, without bending or yielding in\r\nany perceptible degree, the weight of a railroad train, and the jar\r\nof its unchecked motion. Yet of such beams, constructed beforehand\r\nwith the most perfect confidence, crowned with the most complete\r\nsuccess, is composed the great tubular bridge which that consummate\r\nengineer, Mr. Robert Stephenson, has thrown across the Menai Strait,\r\njoining Wales with the island of Anglesey. The upper and under\r\nsurfaces of this quadrangular tube are the flanges of the beam, and\r\nthe two sides are the webs which connect them. In planning this\r\nwonderful structure, the point which required especial care was to\r\nmake the upper surface strong enough to resist the compressive force\r\nwhich it has to sustain; and this was done by constructing the upper\r\npart of the beam of a series of cells, made of iron plate. The\r\napplication of the arch, of the dome, and of groined vaulting, to\r\nthe widest space over which they have ever been thrown, {541} are\r\nachievements which have, in the ages in which they occurred, been\r\nreceived with great admiration and applause; but in those cases the\r\nprinciple of the structure had been tried and verified for ages upon\r\na smaller scale. Here not only was the space thus spanned wider than\r\nany ever spanned before, but the principle of such a beam with a\r\ncellular structure of its parts, was invented for this very purpose,\r\nexperimentally verified with care, and applied with the most exact\r\ncalculation of its results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roofs--Arches--Vaults._\r\n\r\nThe calculations of the mechanical conditions of structures\r\nconsisting of several beams, as for instance, the frames of roofs,\r\ndepends upon elementary principles of mechanics; and was a subject\r\nof investigation at an early period of the science. Such frames may\r\nbe regarded as assemblages of levers. The parts of which they\r\nconsist are rigid beams which sustain and convey force, and _Ties_\r\nwhich resist such force by their tension. The former parts must be\r\nmade rigid in the way just spoken of with regard to iron beams; but\r\nties may be rods merely. The wide structures of many of the roofs of\r\nrailway stations, compared with the massive wooden roofs of ancient\r\nbuildings, may show us how boldly and how successfully this\r\ndistinction has been carried out in modern times. The investigation\r\nof the conditions and strength of structures consisting of wooden\r\nbeams has been cultivated by Mathematicians and Engineers, and is\r\noften entitled _Carpentry_ in our Mechanical Treatises. In our own\r\ntime, Dr. Robison and Dr. Thomas Young have been two of the most\r\neminent mathematicians who have written upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe properties of the simple machines have been known, as we have\r\nnarrated, from the time of the Ancient Greeks. But it is plain that\r\nsuch machines are prevented from producing their full effect by\r\nvarious causes. Among the rest, the rubbing of one part of the\r\nmachine upon another produces an obstacle to the effectiveness of a\r\nmachine: for instance, the rubbing of the axle of a wheel in the\r\nhole in which it rests, the rubbing of a screw against the sides of\r\nits hollow screw; the rubbing of a wedge against the sides of its\r\nnotch; the rubbing of a cord against its pulley. In all these cases,\r\nthe effect of the machine to produce motion is diminished by the\r\nfriction. And this _Friction_ may be measured and its effects\r\ncalculated; and thus we have a new branch of mechanics, which has\r\nbeen much cultivated. {542}\r\n\r\nAmong the effects of friction, we may notice the standing of a stone\r\narch. For each of the vaulting stones of an arch is a truncated\r\nwedge; and though a collection of such stones might be so\r\nproportioned in their weights as to balance exactly, yet this\r\nbalance would be a tottering equilibrium, which the slightest shock\r\nwould throw down, and which would not practically subsist. But the\r\nfriction of the vaulting stones against one another prevents this\r\ninstability from being a practical inconvenience; and makes an\r\nequilibrated arch to be an arch strong for practical purposes. The\r\n_Theory of Arches_ is a portion of Mechanics which has been much\r\ncultivated, and which has led to conclusions of practical use, as\r\nwell as of theoretical beauty.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the invention of the Arch, the Dome, and\r\nGroined Vaulting, as marked steps in building. In all these cases the\r\ninvention was devised by practical builders; and mechanical theory,\r\nthough it can afterwards justify these structures, did not originally\r\nsuggest them. They are not part of the result, nor even of the\r\napplication of theory, but only of its exemplification. The authors of\r\nall these inventions are unknown; and the inventions themselves may be\r\nregarded as a part of the Prelude of the science of mechanics, because\r\nthey indicate that the ideas of mechanical pressure and support, in\r\nvarious forms, are acquiring clearness and fixity.\r\n\r\nIn this point of view, I spoke (Book iv. chap. v. sect. 5) of the\r\nArchitecture of the Middle Ages as indicating a progress of thought\r\nwhich led men towards the formation of Statics as a science.\r\n\r\nAs particular instances of the operation of such ideas, we have the\r\n_Flying Buttresses_ which support stone vaults; and especially, as\r\nalready noted, the various contrivances by which stone vaults are\r\nmade to intersect one another, so as to cover a complex pillared\r\nspace below with _Groined Vaulting_. This invention, executed as it\r\nwas by the builders of the twelfth and succeeding centuries, is the\r\nmost remarkable advance in the mechanics of building, after the\r\ninvention of the _Arch_ itself.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that it has been the fortune of our times, among its\r\nmany inventions, to have produced one in this department, of which\r\nwe may say that it is the most remarkable step in the mechanics of\r\narches which has been made since the introduction of pointed groined\r\nvaults. I speak of what are called _Skew Arches_, in which the\r\ncourses of stone or brick of which the bridge is built run obliquely\r\nto the walls of the bridge. Such bridges have become very common in\r\nthe works of railroads; for they save space and material, and the\r\n{543} invention once made, the cost of the ingenuity is nothing. Of\r\ncourse, the mechanical principles involved in such structures are\r\nobvious to the mathematician, when the problem has been practically\r\nsolved. And in this case, as in the previous cardinal inventions in\r\nstructure, though the event has taken place within a few years, no\r\nsingle person, so far as I am aware, can be named as the\r\ninventor.[39\\A]\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\A: Since this was written, I have been referred to Rees's\r\n_Cyclopædia_, Article _Oblique Arches_, where this invention is\r\ncorrectly explained, and is claimed for an engineer named Chapman.\r\nIt is there said, that the first arch of this kind was erected in\r\n1787 at Naas, near Kildare in Ireland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{544}}\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO NEWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ancients._\r\n\r\nEXPRESSIONS in ancient writers which may be interpreted as\r\nindicating a notion of gravitation in the Newtonian sense, no doubt\r\noccur. But such a notion, we may be sure, must have been in the\r\nhighest degree obscure, wavering, and partial. I have mentioned\r\n(Book i. Chap. 3) an author who has fancied that he traces in the\r\nworks of the ancients the origin of most of the vaunted discoveries\r\nof the moderns. But to ascribe much importance to such expressions\r\nwould be to give a false representation of the real progress of\r\nscience. Yet some of Newton's followers put forward these passages\r\nas well deserving notice; and Newton himself appears to have had\r\nsome pleasure in citing such expressions; probably with the feeling\r\nthat they relieved him of some of the odium which, he seems to have\r\napprehended, hung over new discoveries. The Preface to the\r\n_Principia_, begins by quoting[40\\A] the authority of the ancients,\r\nas well as the moderns, in favor of applying the science of\r\nMechanics to Natural Philosophy. In the Preface to David Gregory's\r\n_Astronomiæ Physicæ et Geometricæ Elementa_, published in 1702, is a\r\nlarge array of names of ancient authors, and of quotations, to prove\r\nthe early and wide diffusion of the doctrine of the gravity of the\r\nHeavenly Bodies. And it appears to be now made out, that this\r\ncollection of ancient authorities {545} was supplied to Gregory by\r\nNewton himself. The late Professor Rigaud, in his _Historical Essay\r\non the First Publication of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia_, says (pp.\r\n80 and 101) that having been allowed to examine Gregory's papers, he\r\nfound that the quotations given by him in his Preface are copied or\r\nabridged from notes which Newton had supplied to him in his own\r\nhandwriting. Some of the most noticeable of the quotations are those\r\ntaken from Plutarch's Dialogue _on the Face which appears in the\r\nMoon's Disk_: it is there said, for example, by one of the speakers,\r\nthat the Moon is perhaps prevented from falling to the earth by the\r\nrapidity of her revolution round it; as a stone whirled in a sling\r\nkeeps it stretched. Lucretius also is quoted, as teaching that all\r\nbodies would descend with an equal celerity in a vacuum:\r\n  Omnia quapropter debent per inane quietum\r\n  Æque ponderibus non æquis concita ferri.\r\n         Lib. ii. v. 238.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\A: Cum veteres _Mechanicam_ (uti author est _Pappus_), in\r\nrerum Naturalium investigatione maximi fecerint, et recentiores,\r\nmissis formis substantialibus et qualitatibus occultis, Phenonmena\r\nNaturæ ad leges mathematicas revocare aggressa sunt; visum est in\r\nhoc Tractatu _Mathesin_ excolere quatenus ea ad _Philosophiam_\r\nspectat.]\r\n\r\nIt is asserted in Gregory's Preface that Pythagoras was not\r\nunacquainted with the important law of gravity, the inverse squares\r\nof the distances from the centre. For, it is argued, the seven\r\nstrings of Apollo's lyre mean the seven planets; and the proportions\r\nof the notes of strings are reciprocally as the inverse squares of\r\nthe weights which stretch them.\r\n\r\nI have attempted, throughout this work, to trace the progress of the\r\ndiscovery of the great truths which constitute real science, in a\r\nmore precise manner than that which these interpretations of ancient\r\nauthors exemplify.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jeremiah Horrox._\r\n\r\nIn describing the Prelude to the Epoch of Newton, I have spoken (p.\r\n395) of a group of philosophers in England who began, in the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century, to knock at the door where Truth\r\nwas to be found, although it was left for Newton to force it open;\r\nand I have there noticed the influence of the civil wars on the\r\nprogress of philosophical studies. To the persons thus tending\r\ntowards the true physical theory of the solar system, I ought to\r\nhave added Jeremy Horrox, whom I have mentioned in a former part\r\n(Book v. chap. 5) as one of the earliest admirers of Kepler's\r\ndiscoveries. He died at the early age of twenty-two, having been the\r\nfirst person who ever saw Venus pass across the disk of the Sun\r\naccording to astronomical prediction, which took place in 1639. His\r\n_Venus in sole visa_, {546} in which this is described, did not\r\nappear till 1661, when it was published by Hevelius of Dantzic. Some\r\nof his papers were destroyed by the soldiers in the English civil\r\nwars; and his remaining works were finally published by Wallis, in\r\n1673. The passage to which I here specially wish to refer is\r\ncontained in a letter to his astronomical ally, William Crabtree,\r\ndated 1638. He appears to have been asked by his friend to suggest\r\nsome cause for the motion of the aphelion of a planet; and in reply,\r\nhe uses an experimental illustration which was afterwards employed\r\nby Hooke in 1666. A ball at the end of a string is made to swing so\r\nthat it describes an oval. This contrivance Hooke employed to show\r\nthe way in which an orbit results from the combination of a\r\nprojectile motion with a central force. But the oval does not keep\r\nits axis constantly in the same position. The apsides, as Horrox\r\nremarked, move in the same direction as the pendulum, though much\r\nslower. And it is true, that this experiment does illustrate, in a\r\ngeneral way, the cause of the motion of the aphelia of the Planetary\r\nOrbits; although the form of the orbit is different in the\r\nexperiment and in the solar system; being an ellipse with the centre\r\nof force in the centre of the ellipse, in the former case, and an\r\nellipse with the centre of force in the focus, in the latter case.\r\nThese two forms of orbits correspond to a central force varying\r\ndirectly as the distance, and a central force varying inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance; as Newton proved in the _Principia_. But\r\nthe illustration appears to show that Horrox pretty clearly saw how\r\nan orbit arose from a central force. So far, and no further,\r\nNewton's contemporaries could get; and then he had to help them\r\nonwards by showing what was the law of the force, and what larger\r\ntruths were now attainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Newton's Discovery of Gravitation._\r\n\r\n[Page 402.] As I have already remarked, men have a willingness to\r\nbelieve that great discoveries are governed by casual coincidences,\r\nand accompanied by sudden revolutions of feeling. Newton had\r\nentertained the thought of the moon being retained in her orbit by\r\ngravitation as early as 1665 or 1666. He resumed the subject and\r\nworked the thought out into a system in 1684 and 5. What induced him\r\nto return to the question? What led to his success on this last\r\noccasion? With what feelings was the success attended? It is easy to\r\nmake an imaginary connection of facts. \"His optical discoveries had\r\nrecommended him to the Royal Society, and he was now a member. He\r\n{547} _there_ learned the accurate measurement of the Earth by\r\nPicard, differing very much from the estimation by which he had made\r\nhis calculation in 1666; and he thought his conjecture now more\r\nlikely to be just.\"[41\\A] M. Biot gives his assent to this\r\nguess.[42\\A] The English translation of M. Biot's biography[43\\A]\r\nconverts the guess into an assertion. But, says Professor\r\nRigaud,[44\\A] Picard's measurement of the Earth was well known to\r\nthe Fellows of the Royal Society as early as 1675, there being an\r\naccount of the results of it given in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for that year. Moreover, Norwood, in his _Seaman's\r\nPractice_, dated 1636, had given a much more exact measure than\r\nNewton employed in 1666. But Norwood, says Voltaire, had been buried\r\nin oblivion by the civil wars. No, again says the exact and\r\ntruth-loving Professor Rigaud, Norwood was in communication with the\r\nRoyal Society in 1667 and 1668. So these guesses at the accident\r\nwhich made the apple of 1665 germinate in 1684, are to be carefully\r\ndistinguished from history.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\A: Robison's _Mechanical Philosophy_, vol. iii. p. 94.\r\n(Art. 195.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\A: _Biographie Universelle_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\A: _Library of Useful Knowledge_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\A: _Historical Essay on the First Publication of the\r\nPrincipia_ (1838).]\r\n\r\nBut with what feelings did Newton attain to his success? Here again\r\nwe have, I fear, nothing better than conjecture. \"He went home, took\r\nout his old papers, and resumed his calculations. As they drew near\r\nto a close, he was so much agitated that he was obliged to desire a\r\nfriend to finish them. His former conjecture was now found to agree\r\nwith the phænomena with the utmost precision.\"[45\\A] This\r\nconjectural story has been called \"a tradition;\" but he who relates\r\nit does not call it so. Every one must decide, says Professor\r\nRigaud, from his view of Newton's character, how far he thinks it\r\nconsistent with this statement. Is it likely that Newton, so calm\r\nand so indifferent to fame as he generally showed himself, should be\r\nthus agitated on such an occasion? \"No,\" says Sir David Brewster;\r\n\"it is not supported by what we know of Newton's character.\"[46\\A]\r\nTo this we may assent; and this conjectural incident we must\r\ntherefore, I conceive, separate from history. I had incautiously\r\nadmitted it into the text of the first Edition.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\A: Robison, ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\A: _Life of Newton_, vol. i. p. 292.]\r\n\r\nNewton appears to have discovered the method of demonstrating that a\r\nbody might describe an ellipse when acted upon by a force residing\r\nin the focus, and varying inversely as the square of the distance,\r\nin 1669, upon occasion of his correspondence with Hooke. In 1684,\r\n{548} at Halley's request, he returned to the subject; and in\r\nFebruary, 1685 there was inserted in the Register of the Royal\r\nSociety a paper of Newton's (_Isaaci Newtoni Propositiones de\r\nMotu_), which contained some of the principal propositions of the\r\nfirst two Books of the _Principia_. This paper, however, does not\r\ncontain the proposition \"Lunam gravitare in Terram,\" nor any of the\r\npropositions of the Third Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  III.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Reception of the Principia._\r\n\r\nLORD BROUGHAM has very recently (_Analytical View of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton's Principia_, 1855) shown a strong disposition still to\r\nmaintain, what he says has frequently been alleged, that the\r\nreception of the work was not, even in this country, \"such as might\r\nhave been expected.\" He says, in explanation of the facts which I\r\nhave adduced, showing the high estimation in which Newton was held\r\nimmediately after the publication of the _Principia_, that Newton's\r\nprevious fame was great by former discoveries. This is true; but the\r\neffect of this was precisely what was most honorable to Newton's\r\ncountrymen, that they received with immediate acclamations this new\r\nand greater discovery. Lord Brougham adds, \"after its appearance the\r\n_Principia_ was more admired than studied;\" which is probably true\r\nof the _Principia_ still, and of all great works of like novelty and\r\ndifficulty at all times. But, says Lord Brougham, \"there is no\r\ngetting over the inference on this head which arises from the dates\r\nof the two first editions. There elapsed an interval of no less than\r\ntwenty-seven years between them; and although Cotes [in his Preface]\r\nspeaks of the copies having become scarce and in very great demand\r\nwhen the second edition appeared in 1713, yet had this urgent demand\r\nbeen of many years' continuance, the reprinting could never have\r\nbeen so long delayed.\" But Lord Brougham might have learnt from Sir\r\nDavid Brewster's _Life of Newton_ (vol. i. p. 312), which he extols\r\nso emphatically, that already in 1691 (only four years after the\r\npublication), a copy of the _Principia_ could hardly be procured,\r\nand that even at that {549} time an improved edition was in\r\ncontemplation; that Newton had been pressed by his friends to\r\nundertake it, and had refused.\r\n\r\nWhen Bentley had induced Newton to consent that a new edition should\r\nbe printed, he announces his success with obvious exultation to\r\nCotes, who was to superintend the work. And in the mean time the\r\n_Astronomy_ of David Gregory, published in 1702, showed in every\r\npage how familiar the Newtonian doctrines were to English\r\nphilosophers, and tended to make them more so, as the sermons of\r\nBentley himself had done in 1692.\r\n\r\nNewton's Cambridge contemporaries were among those who took a part\r\nin bringing the _Principia_ before the world. The manuscript draft\r\nof it was conveyed to the Royal Society (April 28, 1686) by Dr.\r\nVincent, Fellow of Clare Hall, who was the tutor of Whiston,\r\nNewton's deputy in his professorship; and he, in presenting the\r\nwork, spoke of the novelty and dignity of the subject. There exists\r\nin the library of the University of Cambridge a manuscript\r\ncontaining the early Propositions of the _Principia_ as far as Prop.\r\nxxxiii. (which is a part of Section vii., about Falling Bodies).\r\nThis appears to have been a transcript of Newton's Lectures,\r\ndelivered as Lucasian Professor: it is dated October, 1684.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Is Gravitation proportional to Quantity of Matter?_\r\n\r\nIt was a portion of Newton's assertion in his great discovery, that\r\nall the bodies of the universe attract each other with forces which\r\nare _as the quantity of matter_ in each: that is, for instance, the\r\nsun attracts the satellites of any planet just as much as he\r\nattracts the planet itself, in proportion to the quantity of matter\r\nin each; and the planets attract one another just as much as they\r\nattract the sun, according to the quantity of matter.\r\n\r\nTo prove this part of the law _exactly_ is a matter which requires\r\ncareful experiments; and though proved experimentally by Newton, has\r\nbeen considered in our time worthy of re-examination by the great\r\nastronomer Bessel. There was some ground for doubt; for the mass of\r\nJupiter, as deduced from the perturbations of Saturn, was only 1/1070\r\nof the mass of the sun; the mass of the same planet as deduced from\r\nthe perturbations of Juno and Pallas was 1/1045 of that of the Sun. If\r\nthis difference were to be confirmed by accurate observations and\r\ncalculations, it would follow that the attractive power exercised by\r\nJupiter upon the minor planets was greater than that exercised upon\r\n{550} Saturn. And in the same way, if the attraction of the Earth had\r\nany _specific_ relation to different kinds of matter, the time of\r\noscillation of a pendulum of equal length composed wholly or in part\r\nof the two substances would be different. If, for instance, it were\r\nmore intense for magnetized iron than for stone, the iron pendulum\r\nwould oscillate more quickly. Bessel showed[47\\A] that it was possible\r\nto assume hypothetically a constitution of the sun, planets, and their\r\nappendages, such that the attraction of the Sun on the Planets and\r\nSatellites should be proportional to the quantity of matter in each;\r\nbut that the attraction of the Planets on one another would not be on\r\nthe same scale.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\A: _Berlin Mem._ 1824.]\r\n\r\nNewton had made experiments (described in the _Principia_, Book\r\niii., Prop. vi.) by which it was shown that there could be no\r\nconsiderable or palpable amount of such specific difference among\r\nterrestrial bodies, but his experiments could not be regarded as\r\nexact enough for the requirements of modern science. Bessel\r\ninstituted a laborious series of experiments (presented to the\r\nBerlin Academy in 1832) which completely disproved the conjecture of\r\nsuch a difference; every substance examined having given exactly the\r\nsame coefficient of gravitating intensity as compared with inertia.\r\nAmong the substances examined were metallic and stony masses of\r\nmeteoric origin, which might be supposed, if any bodies could, to\r\ncome from other parts of the solar system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVERIFICATION AND COMPLETION OF THE NEWTONIAN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tables of the Moon and Planets._\r\n\r\nTHE Newtonian discovery of Universal Gravitation, so remarkable in\r\nother respects, is also remarkable as exemplifying the immense\r\nextent to which the verification of a great truth may be carried,\r\nthe amount of human labor which may be requisite to do it justice,\r\nand the striking extension of human knowledge to which it may lead.\r\nI have said that it is remarked as a beauty in the first fixation of\r\na theory that its measures or elements are established by means of a\r\nfew {551} data; but that its excellence when established is in the\r\nnumber of observations which it explains. The multiplicity of\r\nobservations which are explained by astronomy, and which are made\r\nbecause astronomy explains them, is immense, as I have noted in the\r\ntext. And the multitude of observations thus made is employed for\r\nthe purpose of correcting the first adopted elements of the theory.\r\nI have mentioned some of the examples of this process: I might\r\nmention many others in order to continue the history of this part of\r\nAstronomy up to the present time. But I will notice only those which\r\nseem to me the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, Burckhardt's _Tables de la Lune_ were published by the\r\nFrench Bureau des Longitudes. A comparison of these and Burg's with\r\na considerable number of observations, gave 9-100ths of a second as\r\nthe mean error of the former in the Moon's longitude, while the mean\r\nerror of Burg's was 18-100ths. The preference was therefore accorded\r\nto Burckhardt's.\r\n\r\nYet the Lunar Tables were still as much as thirty seconds wrong in\r\nsingle observations. This circumstance, and Laplace's expressed wish,\r\ninduced the French Academy to offer a prize for a complete and purely\r\ntheoretical determination of the Lunar path, instead of determinations\r\nresting, as hitherto, partly upon theory and partly upon observations.\r\nIn 1820, two prize essays appeared, the one by Damoiseau, the other by\r\nPlana and Carlini. And some years afterwards (in 1824, and again in\r\n1828), Damoiseau published _Tables de la Lune formées sur la seule\r\nThéorie d'Attraction_. These agree very closely with observation. That\r\nwe may form some notion of the complexity of the problem, I may state\r\nthat the longitude of the Moon is in these Tables affected by no fewer\r\nthan forty-seven _equations_; and the other quantities which determine\r\nher place are subject to inequalities not much less in number.\r\n\r\nStill I had to state in the second Edition, published in 1847, that\r\nthere remained an unexplained discordance between theory and\r\nobservation in the motions of the Moon; an inequality of long period\r\nas it seemed, which the theory did not give.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of a long series of the best observations of\r\nthe Moon, compared throughout with the theory in its most perfect\r\nform, would afford the means both of correcting the numerical\r\nelements of the theory, and of detecting the nature, and perhaps the\r\nlaw, of any still remaining discrepancies. Such a work, however,\r\nrequired vast labor, as well as great skill and profound\r\nmathematical knowledge. {552} Mr. Airy undertook the task; employing\r\nfor that purpose, the Observations of the Moon made at Greenwich\r\nfrom 1750 to 1830. Above 8000 observed places of the Moon were\r\ncompared with theory by the computation of the same number of\r\nplaces, each separately and independently calculated from Plana's\r\nFormulæ. A body of calculators (sometimes sixteen), at the expense\r\nof the British Government, was employed for about eight years in\r\nthis work. When we take this in conjunction with the labor which the\r\nobservations themselves imply, it may serve to show on what a scale\r\nthe verification of the Newtonian theory has been conducted. The\r\nfirst results of this labor were published in two quarto volumes;\r\nthe final deductions as to correction of elements, &c., were given\r\nin the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society in 1848.[48\\A]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\A: The total expense of computers, to the end of reading\r\nthe proof-sheets, was 4300_l._\r\n\r\nMr. Airy's estimate of days' works [made before beginning], for the\r\nheavy part of calculations only, was thirty-six years of one computer.\r\nThis was somewhat exceeded, but not very greatly, in that part.]\r\n\r\nEven while the calculations were going on, it became apparent that\r\nthere were some differences between the observed places of the Moon,\r\nand the theory so far as it had then been developed. M. Hansen, an\r\neminent German mathematician who had devised new and powerful\r\nmethods for the mathematical determination of the results of the law\r\nof gravitation, was thus led to explore still further the motions of\r\nthe Moon in pursuance of this law. The result was that he found\r\nthere must exist two lunar inequalities, hitherto not known; the one\r\nof 273, and the other of 239 years, the coefficients of which are\r\nrespectively 27 and 23 seconds. Both these originate in the\r\nattraction of Venus; one of them being connected with the long\r\ninequality in the Solar Tables, of which Mr. Airy had already proved\r\nthe existence, as stated in Chap. vi. Sect. 6 of this Book.\r\n\r\nThese inequalities fell in with the discrepancies between the actual\r\nobservations and the previously calculated Tables, which Mr. Airy\r\nhad discovered. And again, shortly afterwards, M. Hansen found that\r\nthere resulted from the theory two other new equations of the Moon;\r\none in latitude and one in longitude, agreeing with two which were\r\nfound by Mr. Airy in deducing from the observations the correction\r\nof the elements of the Lunar Tables. And again, a little later,\r\nthere was detected by these mathematicians a theoretical correction\r\nfor the {553} motion of the Node of the Moon's orbit, coinciding\r\nexactly with one which had been found to appear in the observations.\r\n\r\nNothing can more strikingly exhibit the confirmation which increased\r\nscrutiny brings to light between the Newtonian theory on the one\r\nhand, and the celestial motions on the other. We have here a very\r\nlarge mass of the best observations which have ever been made,\r\nsystematically examined, with immense labor, and with the set\r\npurpose of correcting at once all the elements of the Lunar Tables.\r\nThe corrections of the elements thus deduced imply of course some\r\nerror in the theory as previously developed. But at the same time,\r\nand with the like determination thoroughly to explore the subject,\r\nthe theory is again pressed to yield its most complete results, by\r\nthe invention of new and powerful mathematical methods; and the\r\nevent is, that residual errors of the old Tables, several in number,\r\nfollowing the most diverse laws, occurring in several detached\r\nparts, agree with the residual results of the Theory thus newly\r\nextracted from it. And thus every additional exactness of scrutiny\r\ninto the celestial motions on the one hand and the Newtonian theory\r\non the other, has ended, sooner or later, in showing the exactness\r\nof their coincidence.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the theory with observation in the case of the\r\nmotions of the Planets, the motion of each being disturbed by the\r\nattraction of all the others, is a subject in some respects still\r\nmore complicated and laborious. This work also was undertaken by the\r\nsame indefatigable astronomer; and here also his materials belonged\r\nto the same period as before; being the admirable observations made\r\nat Greenwich from 1750 to 1830, during the time that Bradley,\r\nMaskelyne, and Pond were the Astronomers Royal.[49\\A] These\r\nPlanetary observations were deduced, and the observed places were\r\ncompared with the tabular places: with Lindenau's Tables of Mercury,\r\nVenus, and Mars; and with Bouvard's Tables of Jupiter, Saturn, and\r\nUranus; and thus, while the received theory and its elements were\r\nconfirmed, the means of testing any improvement which may hereafter\r\nbe proposed, either in the form of the theoretical results or in the\r\nconstant elements which they involved, was placed within the reach\r\nof the {554} astronomers of all future time. The work appeared in\r\n1845; the expense of the compilations and the publication being\r\ndefrayed by the British Government.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\A: The observations of stars made by Bradley, who preceded\r\nMaskelyne at Greenwich, had already been discussed by Bessel, a\r\ngreat German astronomer; and the results published in 1818, with a\r\ntitle that well showed the estimation in which he held those\r\nmaterials: _Fundamenta Astronomiæ pro anno_ 1775, _deducta ex\r\nOhservationibus viri incomparabilis James Bradley in specula\r\nAstronomica Grenovicensi per annos_ 1750-1762 _institutis_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Discovery of Neptune._\r\n\r\nThe theory of gravitation was destined to receive a confirmation\r\nmore striking than any which could arise from any explanation,\r\nhowever perfect, given by the motions of a known planet; namely, in\r\nrevealing the existence of an unknown planet, disclosed to\r\nastronomers by the attraction which it exerted upon a known one. The\r\nstory of the discovery of Neptune by the calculations of Mr. Adams\r\nand M. Le Verrier was partly told in the former edition of this\r\nHistory. I had there stated (vol. ii. p. 306) that \"a deviation of\r\nobservation from the theory occurs at the very extremity of the\r\nsolar system, and that its existence appears to be beyond doubt.\r\nUranus does not conform to the Tables calculated for him on the\r\ntheory of gravitation. In 1821, Bouvard said in the Preface to the\r\nTables of this Planet, \"the formation of these Tables offers to us\r\nthis alternative, that we cannot satisfy modern observations to the\r\nrequisite degree of precision without making our Tables deviate from\r\nthe ancient observations.\" But when we have done this, there is\r\nstill a discordance between the Tables and the more modern\r\nobservations, and this discordance goes on increasing. At present\r\nthe Tables make the Planet come upon the meridian about eight\r\nseconds later than he really does. This discrepancy has turned the\r\nthoughts of astronomers to the effects which would result from a\r\nplanet external to Uranus. It appears that the observed motion would\r\nbe explained by applying a planet at twice the distance of Uranus\r\nfrom the Sun to exercise a disturbing force, and it is found that\r\nthe present longitude of this disturbing body must be about 325\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nI added, \"M. Le Verrier (_Comptes Rendus_, Jan. 1, 1846) and, as I\r\nam informed by the Astronomer Royal, Mr. Adams, of St. John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, have both arrived independently at this result.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Edition I added a Postscript, dated, Nov. 7, 1846, in which\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\"The planet exterior to Uranus, of which the existence was inferred\r\nby M. Le Verrier and Mr. Adams from the motions of Uranus (vol. ii.\r\nNote (L.)), has since been discovered. This confirmation of\r\ncalculations founded upon the doctrine of universal gravitation, may\r\nbe looked upon as the most remarkable event of the kind since the\r\nreturn of Halley's comet in 1757  and in some respects, as a more\r\nstriking event {555} even than that; inasmuch as the new planet had\r\nnever been seen at all, and was discovered by mathematicians\r\nentirely by their feeling of its influence, which they perceived\r\nthrough the organ of mathematical calculation.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that to M. Le Verrier belongs the glory of\r\nhaving first published a prediction of the place and appearance of the\r\nnew planet, and of having thus occasioned its discovery by\r\nastronomical observers. M. Le Verrier's first prediction was published\r\nin the _Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences_, for _June_ 1, 1846\r\n(not _Jan._ 1, as erroneously printed in my Note). A subsequent paper\r\non the subject was read Aug. 31. The planet was seen by M. Galle, at\r\nthe Observatory of Berlin, on September 23, on which day he had\r\nreceived an express application from M. Le Verrier, recommending him\r\nto endeavor to recognize the stranger by its having a visible disk.\r\nProfessor Challis, at the Observatory of Cambridge, was looking out\r\nfor the new planet from July 29, and saw it on August 4, and again on\r\nAugust 12, but without recognizing it, in consequence of his plan of\r\nnot comparing his observations till he had accumulated a greater\r\nnumber of them. On Sept. 29, having read for the first time M. Le\r\nVerrier's second paper, he altered his plan, and paid attention to the\r\nphysical appearance rather than the position of the star. On that very\r\nevening, not having then heard of M. Galle's discovery, he singled out\r\nthe star by its seeming to have a disk.\r\n\r\n\"M. Le Verrier's mode of discussing the circumstances of Uranus's\r\nmotion, and inferring the new planet from these circumstances, is in\r\nthe highest degree sagacious and masterly. Justice to him cannot\r\nrequire that the contemporaneous, though unpublished, labors of Mr.\r\nAdams, of St John's College, Cambridge, should not also be recorded.\r\nMr. Adams made his first calculations to account for the anomalies\r\nin the motion of Uranus, on the hypothesis of a more distant planet,\r\nin 1843. At first he had not taken into account the earlier\r\nGreenwich observations; but these were supplied to him by the\r\nAstronomer Royal, in 1844. In September, 1845, Mr. Adams\r\ncommunicated to Professor Challis values of the elements of the\r\nsupposed disturbing body; namely, its mean distance, mean longitude\r\nat a given epoch, longitude of perihelion, eccentricity of orbit,\r\nand mass. In the next month, he communicated to the Astronomer Royal\r\nvalues of the same elements, somewhat corrected. The note (L.), vol.\r\nii., of the present work (2d Ed.), in which the names of MM. Le\r\nVerrier and Adams are mentioned in conjunction, was in the press in\r\nAugust, 1846, a {556} month before the planet was seen. As I have\r\nstated in the text, Mr. Adams and M. Le Verrier assigned to the\r\nunseen planet nearly the same position; they also assigned to it\r\nnearly the same mass; namely, 2½ times the mass of Uranus. And\r\nhence, supposing the density to be not greater than that of Uranus,\r\nit followed that the visible diameter would be about 3\", an apparent\r\nmagnitude not much smaller than Uranus himself.\r\n\r\n\"M. Le Verrier has mentioned for the new planet the name _Neptunus_;\r\nand probably, deference to his authority as its discoverer, will\r\nobtain general currency for this name.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Airy has given a very complete history of the circumstances\r\nattending the discovery of Neptune, in the Memoirs of the\r\nAstronomical Society (read November 13, 1846). In this he shows that\r\nthe probability of some disturbing body beyond Uranus had suggested\r\nitself to M. A. Bouvard and Mr. Hussey as early as 1834. Mr. Airy\r\nhimself then thought that the time was not ripe for making out the\r\nnature of any external action on the planets. But Mr. Adams soon\r\nafterwards proceeded to work at the problem. As early as 1841 (as he\r\nhimself informs me) he conjectured the existence of a planet\r\nexterior to Uranus, and recorded in a memorandum his design of\r\nexamining its effect; but deferred the calculations till he had\r\ncompleted his preparations for the University examination which he\r\nwas to undergo in January, 1843, in order to receive the Degree of\r\nBachelor of Arts. He was the Senior Wrangler of that occasion, and\r\nsoon afterwards proceeded to carry his design into effect; applying\r\nto the Astronomer Royal for recorded observations which might aid\r\nhim in his task. On one of the last days of October, 1845, Mr. Adams\r\nwent to the Observatory at Greenwich; and finding the Astronomer\r\nRoyal abroad, he left there a paper containing the elements of the\r\nextra-Uranian Planet: the longitude was in this paper stated as 323½\r\ndegrees. It was, as we have seen, in June, 1846, that M. Le\r\nVerrier's Memoir appeared, in which he assigned to the disturbing\r\nbody a longitude of 325 degrees. The coincidence was striking. \"I\r\ncannot sufficiently express,\" says Mr. Airy, \"the feeling of delight\r\nand satisfaction which I received from the Memoir of M. Le Verrier.\"\r\nThis feeling communicated itself to others. Sir John Herschel said\r\nin September, 1846, at a meeting of the British Association at\r\nSouthampton, \"We see it (the probable new planet) as Columbus saw\r\nAmerica from the shores of Spain. Its movements have been felt,\r\ntrembling along the far-reaching line of our analysis, with a\r\ncertainty hardly inferior to that of ocular demonstration.\" {557}\r\n\r\nIn truth, at the moment when this was uttered, the new Planet had\r\nalready been seen by Professor Challis; for, as we have said, he had\r\nseen it in the early part of August. He had included it in the net\r\nwhich he had cast among the stars for this very purpose; but\r\nemploying a slow and cautious process, he had deferred for a time\r\nthat examination of his capture which would have enabled him to\r\ndetect the object sought. As soon as he received M. Le Verrier's\r\npaper of August 31 on September 29, he was so much impressed with\r\nthe sagacity and clearness of the limitations of the field of\r\nobservation there laid down, that he instantly changed his plan of\r\nobservation, and noted the planet, as an object having a visible\r\ndisk, on the evening of the same day.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the theory of gravitation predicted and produced the\r\ndiscovery. Thus to predict unknown facts found afterwards to be\r\ntrue, is, as I have said, a confirmation of a theory which in\r\nimpressiveness and value goes beyond any explanation of known facts.\r\nIt is a confirmation which has only occurred a few times in the\r\nhistory of science; and in the case only of the most refined and\r\ncomplete theories, such as those of Astronomy and Optics. The\r\nmathematical skill which was requisite in order to arrive at such a\r\ndiscovery, may in some measure be judged of by the account which we\r\nhave had to give of the previous mathematical progress of the theory\r\nof gravitation. It there appeared that the lives of many of the most\r\nacute, clear-sighted, and laborious of mankind, had been employed\r\nfor generations in solving the problem. Given the planetary bodies,\r\nto find their mutual perturbations: but here we have the inverse\r\nproblem--Given the perturbations, to find the planets.[50\\A]\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\A: This may be called the _inverse_ problem with reference\r\nto the older and more familiar problem; but we may remark that the\r\nusual phraseology of the Problem of Central Forces differs from this\r\nanalogy. In Newton's _Principia_, the earlier Sections, in which the\r\nmotion is given to find the force, are spoken of as containing the\r\nDirect Problem of Central Forces: the Eighth Section of the First\r\nBook, where the Force is given to find the orbit, is spoken of as\r\ncontaining the _Inverse_ Problem of Central Forces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Minor Planets._\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Minor Planets which revolve between the orbits\r\nof Mars and Jupiter was not a consequence or confirmation of the\r\nNewtonian theory. That theory gives no reason for the distance of\r\n{558} the Planets from the Sun; nor does any theory yet devised give\r\nsuch reason. But an empirical formula proposed by the Astronomer\r\nBode of Berlin, gives a law of these distances (_Bode's Law_),\r\nwhich, to make it coherent, requires a planet between Mars and\r\nJupiter. With such an addition, the distance of Mercury, Venus,\r\nEarth, Mars, the Missing Planet, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, are\r\nnearly as the numbers 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196, in which the\r\nexcesses of each number above the preceding are the series 3, 3, 6,\r\n12, 24, 48, 96. On the strength of this law the Germans wrote _on the\r\nlong-expected Planet_, and formed themselves into associations for\r\nthe discovery of it.\r\n\r\nNot only did this law stimulate the inquiries for the Missing\r\nPlanet, and thus lead to the discovery of the Minor Planets, but it\r\nhad also a share in the discovery of Neptune. According to the law,\r\na planet beyond Uranus may be expected to be at the distance\r\nrepresented by 388. Mr. Adams and M. Le Verrier both of them began\r\nby assuming a distance of nearly this magnitude for the Planet which\r\nthey sought; that is, a distance more than 38 times the earth's\r\ndistance. It was found afterwards that the distance of Neptune is\r\nonly 30 times that of the earth; yet the assumption was of essential\r\nuse in obtaining the result  and Mr. Airy remarks that the history\r\nof the discovery shows the importance of using any received theory\r\nas far as it will go, even if the theory can claim no higher merit\r\nthan that of being plausible.[51\\A]\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\A: Account of the Discovery of Neptune, &c., _Mem. Ast.\r\nSoc._, vol. xvi. p. 414.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Minor Planets in a certain region of the interval\r\nbetween Mars and Jupiter has gone on to such an extent, that their\r\nnumber makes them assume in a peculiar manner the character of\r\nrepresentatives of a Missing Planet. At first, as I have said in the\r\ntext, it was supposed that all these portions must pass through or\r\nnear a common node; this opinion being founded on the very bold\r\ndoctrine, that the portions must at one time have been united in one\r\nPlanet, and must then have separated. At this node, as I have\r\nstated, Olbers lay in wait for them, as for a hostile army at a\r\ndefile. Ceres, Pallas, and Juno had been discovered in this way in\r\nthe period from 1801 to 1804; and Vesta was caught in 1807. For a\r\ntime the chase for new planets in this region seemed to have\r\nexhausted the stock. But after thirty-eight years, to the\r\nastonishment of astronomers, they began to be again detected in\r\nextraordinary numbers. In 1845, M. Hencke of {559} Driessen\r\ndiscovered a fifth of these planets, which was termed Astræa. In\r\nvarious quarters the chase was resumed with great ardor. In 1847\r\nwere found Hebe, Iris, and Flora; in 1848, Metis; in 1849, Hygæa; in\r\n1850, Parthenope, Victoria, and Egeria; in 1861, Irene and Eunomia;\r\nin 1852, Psyche, Thetis, Melpomene, Fortuna, Massilia, Lutetia,\r\nCalliope. To these we have now (at the close of 1856) to add\r\n_nineteen_ others; making up the whole number of these Minor Planets\r\nat present known to _forty-two_.\r\n\r\nAs their enumeration will show, the ancient practice has been\r\ncontinued of giving to the Planets mythological names. And for a\r\ntime, till the numbers became too great, each of the Minor Planets\r\nwas designated in astronomical books by some symbol appropriate to\r\nthe character of the mythological person; as from ancient times Mars\r\nhas been denoted by a mark indicating a spear, and Venus by one\r\nrepresenting a looking-glass. Thus, when a Minor Planet was\r\ndiscovered at London in 1851, the year in which the peace of the\r\nworld was, in a manner, celebrated by the Great Exhibition of the\r\nProducts of All Nations, held at that metropolis, the name _Irene_\r\nwas given to the new star, as a memorial of the auspicious time of\r\nits discovery. And it was agreed, for awhile, that its symbol should\r\nbe a dove with an olive-branch. But the vast multitude of the Minor\r\nPlanets, as discovery went on, made any mode of designation, except\r\na numerical one, practically inconvenient. They are now denoted by a\r\nsmall circle inclosing a figure in the order of their discovery.\r\nThus, _Ceres_ is (1), _Irene_ is (14), and _Isis_ is (42).\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which these discoveries were made was owing in\r\npart to the formation of star-maps, in which all known fixed stars\r\nbeing represented, the existence of a new and movable star might be\r\nrecognized by comparison of the sky with the map. These maps were\r\nfirst constructed by astronomers of different countries at the\r\nsuggestion of the Academy of Berlin; but they have since been\r\ngreatly extended, and now include much smaller stars than were\r\noriginally laid down.\r\n\r\nI will mention the number of planets discovered in each year. After\r\nthe start was once made, by Hencke's discovery of Astræa in 1845,\r\nthe same astronomer discovered Hebe in 1847; and in the same year\r\nMr. Hind, of London, discovered two others, Iris and Flora. The\r\nyears 1848 and 1849 each supplied one; the year 1850, three; 1851,\r\ntwo; 1852 was marked by the extraordinary discovery of _eight_ new\r\nmembers of the planetary system. The year 1853 supplied four; 1854,\r\nsix; 1855, four; and 1856 has already given us five. {560}\r\n\r\nThese discoveries have been distributed among the observatories of\r\nEurope. The bright sky of Naples has revealed seven new planets to\r\nthe telescope of Signer Gasparis. Marseilles has given us one;\r\nGermany, four, discovered by M. Luther at Bilk; Paris has furnished\r\nseven; and Mr. Hind, in Mr. Bishop's private observatory in London,\r\nnotwithstanding our turbid skies, has discovered no less than ten\r\nplanets; and there also Mr. Marth discovered (29) Amphitrite. Mr.\r\nGraham, at the private observatory of Mr. Cooper, in Ireland,\r\ndiscovered (9) Metis.\r\n\r\nAmerica has supplied its planet, namely (31) Euphrosyne, discovered\r\nby Mr. Ferguson at Washington  and the most recent of these\r\ndiscoveries is that by Mr. Pogson, of Oxford, who has found the\r\nforty-second of these Minor Planets, which has been named\r\nIsis.[52\\A]\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\A: I take this list from a Memoir of M. Bruhns, Berlin,\r\n1856.]\r\n\r\nI may add that it appears to follow from the best calculations that\r\nthe total mass of all these bodies is very small. Herschel reckoned\r\nthe diameters of Ceres at 35, and of Pallas at 26 miles. It has\r\nsince been calculated[53\\A] that some of them are smaller still;\r\nVictoria having a diameter of 9 miles, Lutetia of 8, and Atalanta of\r\nlittle more than 4. It follows from this that the whole mass would\r\nprobably be less than the sixth part of our moon. Hence their\r\nperturbing effects on each other or on other planets are null; but\r\nthey are not the less disturbed by the action of the other planets,\r\nand especially of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\A: Bruhns, as above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anomalies in the Action of Gravitation._\r\n\r\nThe complete and exact manner in which the doctrine of gravitation\r\nexplains the motions of the Comets as well as of the Planets, has\r\nmade astronomers very bold in proposing hypotheses to account for\r\nany deviations from the motion which the theory requires. Thus\r\nEncke's Comet is found to have its motion accelerated by about\r\none-eighth of a day in every revolution. This result was conceived\r\nto be established by former observations, and is confirmed by the\r\nfacts of the appearance of 1852.[54\\A] The hypothesis which is\r\nproposed in order to explain this result is, that the Comet moves in\r\na resisting medium, which makes it fall inwards from its path,\r\ntowards the Sun, and thus, by narrowing its orbit, diminishes its\r\nperiodic time. On the other hand, M. Le Verrier has found that\r\nMercury's mean motion has gone on diminishing; {561} as if the\r\nplanet were, in the progress of his revolutions, receding further\r\nfrom the Sun. This is explained, if we suppose that there is, in the\r\nregion of Mercury, a resisting medium which moves round the Sun in\r\nthe same direction as the Planets move. Evidence of a kind of\r\nnebulous disk surrounding the Sun, and extending beyond the orbits\r\nof Mercury and Venus, appears to be afforded us by the phenomenon\r\ncalled the _Zodiacal Light_; and as the Sun itself rotates on its\r\naxis, it is most probable that this kind of atmosphere rotates\r\nalso.[55\\A] On the other hand, M. Le Verrier conceives that the\r\nComets which now revolve within the ordinary planetary limits have\r\nnot always done so, but have been caught and detained by the Planets\r\namong which they move. In this way the action of Jupiter has brought\r\nthe Comets of Faye and Vico into their present limited orbits, as it\r\ndrew the Comet of Lexell out of its known orbit, when the Comet passed\r\nover the Planet in 1779, since which time it has not been seen.\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\A: _Berlin Memoirs_, 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\A: M. Le Verrier, _Annales de l'Obs. de Paris_, vol. i.\r\np. 89.]\r\n\r\nAmong the examples of the boldness with which astronomers assume the\r\ndoctrine of gravitation even beyond the limits of the solar system\r\nto be so entirely established, that hypotheses may and must be\r\nassumed to explain any apparent irregularity of motion, we may\r\nreckon the mode of accounting for certain supposed irregularities in\r\nthe proper motion of Sirius, which has been proposed by Bessel, and\r\nwhich M. Peters thinks is proved to be true by his recent researches\r\n(_Astr. Nach._ xxxi. p. 219, and xxxii. p. 1). The hypothesis is,\r\nthat Sirius has a companion star, dark, and therefore invisible to\r\nus; and that the two, revolving round their common centre as the\r\nsystem moves on, the motion of Sirius is seen to be sometimes\r\nquicker and sometimes slower.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earth's Density._\r\n\r\n\"Cavendish's experiment,\" as it is commonly called--the measure of\r\nthe attractions of manageable masses by the torsion balance, in\r\norder to determine the density of the Earth--has been repeated\r\nrecently by Professor Reich at Freiberg, and by Mr. Baily in\r\nEngland, with great attention to the means of attaining accuracy.\r\nProfessor Reich's result for the density of the Earth is 5·44; Mr.\r\nBaily's is 5·92. Cavendish's result was 5·48; according to recent\r\nrevisions[56\\A] it is 5·52. {562}\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\A: The calculation has been revised by M. Edward Schmidt.\r\nHumboldt's _Kosmos_, ii. p. 425.]\r\n\r\nBut the statical effect of the attraction of manageable masses, or\r\neven of mountains, is very small. The effect of a small change in\r\ngravity may be accumulated by being constantly repeated in the\r\noscillations of a pendulum, and thus may become perceptible. Mr.\r\nAiry attempted to determine the density of the Earth by a method\r\ndepending on this view. A pendulum oscillating at the surface was to\r\nbe compared with an equal pendulum at a great depth below the\r\nsurface. The difference of their rates would disclose the different\r\nforce of gravity at the two positions; and hence, the density of the\r\nEarth. In 1826 and 1828, Mr. Airy attempted this experiment at the\r\ncopper mine of Dolcoath in Cornwall, but failed from various causes.\r\nBut in 1854, he resumed it at the Harton coal mine in Durham, the\r\ndepth of which is 1260 feet; having in this new trial, the advantage\r\nof transmitting the time from one station to the other by the\r\ninstantaneous effect of galvanism, instead of by portable watches.\r\nThe result was a density of 6·56; which is much larger than the\r\npreceding results, but, as Mr. Airy holds, is entitled to compete\r\nwith the others on at least equal terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tides._\r\n\r\nI should be wanting in the expression of gratitude to those who have\r\npractically assisted me in Researches on the Tides, if I did not\r\nmention the grand series of Tide Observations made on the coast of\r\nEurope and America in June, 1835, through the authority of the Board\r\nof Admiralty, and the interposition of the late Duke of Wellington, at\r\nthat time Foreign Secretary. Tide observations were made for a\r\nfortnight at all the Coast-guard stations of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nin June, 1834; and these were repeated in June, 1835, with\r\ncorresponding observations on all the coasts of Europe, from the North\r\nCape of Norway to the Straits of Gibraltar; and from the mouth of the\r\nSt. Lawrence to the mouth of the Mississippi. The results of these\r\nobservations, which were very complete so far as the coast tides were\r\nconcerned, were given in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1836.\r\n\r\nAdditional accuracy respecting the Tides of the North American coast\r\nmay be expected from the survey now going on under the direction of\r\nSuperintendent A. Bache. The Tides of the English Channel have been\r\nfurther investigated, and the phenomena presented under a new point of\r\nview by Admiral Beechey. {563}\r\n\r\nThe Tides of the Coast of Ireland have been examined with great care\r\nby Mr. Airy. Numerous and careful observations were made with a view,\r\nin the first instance, of determining what was to be regarded as \"the\r\nLevel of the Sea;\" but the results were discussed so as to bring into\r\nview the laws and progress, on the Irish coast, of the various\r\ninequalities of the Tides mentioned in Chap. iv. Sect. 9 of this Book.\r\n\r\nI may notice as one of the curious results of the Tide Observations\r\nof 1836, that it appeared to me, from a comparison of the\r\nObservations, that there must be a point in the German Ocean, about\r\nmidway between Lowestoft on the English coast, and the Brill on the\r\nDutch coast, where the tide would vanish: and this was ascertained\r\nto be the case by observation; the observations being made by\r\nCaptain Hewett, then employed in a survey of that sea.\r\n\r\n_Cotidal Lines_ supply, as I conceive, a good and simple method of\r\nrepresenting the progress and connection of _littoral_ tides. But to\r\ndraw cotidal lines across oceans, is a very precarious mode of\r\nrepresenting the facts, except we had much more knowledge on the\r\nsubject than we at present possess. In the _Phil. Trans._ for 1848,\r\nI have resumed the subject of the Tides of the Pacific; and I have\r\nthere expressed my opinion, that while the littoral tides are\r\nproduced by progressive waves, the oceanic tides are more of the\r\nnature of stationary undulations.\r\n\r\nBut many points of this kind might be decided, and our knowledge on\r\nthis subject might be brought to a condition of completeness, if a\r\nship or ships were sent expressly to follow the phenomena of the\r\nTides from point to point, as the observations themselves might\r\nsuggest a course. Till this is done, our knowledge cannot be\r\ncompleted. Detached and casual observations, made _aliud agendo_,\r\ncan never carry us much beyond the point where we at present are.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Double Stars._\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel's work, referred to in the History (2d Ed.) as\r\nthen about to appear, was published in 1847.[57\\A] In this work,\r\nbesides a vast amount of valuable observations and reasonings on\r\nother subjects {564} (as Nebulæ, the Magnitude of Stars, and the\r\nlike), the orbits of several double stars are computed by the aid of\r\nthe new observations. But Sir John Herschel's conviction on the\r\npoint in question, the operation of the Newtonian law of gravitation\r\nin the region of the stars, is expressed perhaps more clearly in\r\nanother work which he published in 1849.[58\\A] He there speaks of\r\nDouble Stars, and especially of _gamma Virginis_, the one which has\r\nbeen most assiduously watched, and has offered phenomena of the\r\ngreatest interest.[59\\A] He then finds that the two components of\r\nthis star revolve round each other in a period of 182 years; and\r\nsays that the elements of the calculated orbit represent the whole\r\nseries of recorded observations, comprising an angular movement of\r\nnearly nine-tenths of a complete circuit, both in angle and\r\ndistance, with a degree of exactness fully equal to that of\r\nobservation itself. \"No doubt can therefore,\" he adds, \"remain as to\r\nthe **prevalence in this remote system of the Newtonian Law of\r\nGravitation.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\A: _Results of Astronomical Observations made during the\r\nyears_ 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, _at the Cape of Good Hope, being the\r\ncompletion of a Telescopic Survey of the whole Surface of the\r\nvisible Heavens commenced in_ 1825.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\A: _Outlines of Astronomy_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\A: _Out._ 844.]\r\n\r\nYet M. Yvon de Villarceau has endeavored to show[60\\A] that this\r\nconclusion, however probable, is not yet proved. He holds, even for\r\nthe Double Stars, which have been most observed, the observations are\r\nonly equivalent to seven or eight really distinct data, and that seven\r\ndata are not sufficient to determine that an ellipse is described\r\naccording to the Newtonian law. Without going into the details of this\r\nreasoning, I may remark, that the more rapid relative angular motion\r\nof the components of a Double Star when they are more near each other,\r\nproves, as is allowed on all hands, that they revolve under the\r\ninfluence of a mutual attractive force, obeying the Keplerian Law of\r\nAreas. But that, whether this force follows the law of the inverse\r\nsquare or some other law, can hardly have been rigorously proved as\r\nyet, we may easily conceive, when we recollect the manner in which\r\nthat law was proved for the Solar System. It was by means of an error\r\nof _eight minutes_, observed by Tycho, that Kepler was enabled, as he\r\njustly boasted, to reform the scheme of the Solar System,--to show,\r\nthat is, that the planetary orbits are ellipses with the sun in the\r\nfocus. Now, the observations of Double Stars cannot pretend to such\r\naccuracy as this; and therefore the Keplerian theorem cannot, as yet,\r\nhave been fully demonstrated from those observations. But when we know\r\n{565} that Double Stars are held together by a central force, to prove\r\nthat this force follows a different law from the only law which has\r\nhitherto been found to obtain in the universe, and which obtains\r\nbetween all the known masses of the universe, would require very clear\r\nand distinct evidence, of which astronomers have as yet seen no trace.\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\A: _Connaissance des Temps_, for 1852; published in 1849.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1. _Instruments._--2. _Clocks._\r\n\r\nIN page 473, I have described the manner in which astronomers are able\r\nto observe the transit of a star, and other astronomical phenomena, to\r\nthe exactness of a tenth of a second of time. The mode of observation\r\nthere described implies that the observer at the moment of observation\r\ncompares the impressions of the eye and of the ear. Now it is found\r\nthat the habit which the observer must form of doing this operates\r\ndifferently in different observers, so that one observer notes the\r\nsame fact as happening a fraction of a second earlier or later than\r\nanother observer does; and this in every case. Thus, using the term\r\n_equation_, as we use it in Astronomy, to express a correction by\r\nwhich we get regularity from irregularity, there is a _personal\r\nequation_ belonging to this mode of observation, showing that it is\r\nliable to error. Can this error be got rid of?\r\n\r\nIt is at any rate much diminished by a method of observation recently\r\nintroduced into observatories, and first practised in America. The\r\nessential feature of this mode of observation consists in combining\r\nthe impression of sight with that of touch, instead of with that of\r\nhearing. The observer at the moment of observation presses with his\r\nfinger so as to make a mark on a machine which by its motion measures\r\ntime with great accuracy and on a large scale; and thus small\r\nintervals of time are made visible.\r\n\r\nA universal, though not a necessary, part of this machinery, as\r\nhitherto adopted, is, that a galvanic circuit has been employed in\r\nconveying the impression from the finger to the part where time is\r\nmeasured and marked. The facility with which galvanic wires can {566}\r\nthus lead the impression by any path to any distance, and increase its\r\nforce in any degree, has led to this combination, and almost\r\nidentification, of observation by touch with its record by galvanism.\r\n\r\nThe method having been first used by Mr. Bond at Cambridge, in North\r\nAmerica, has been adopted elsewhere, and especially at Greenwich,\r\nwhere it is used for all the instruments; and consequently a\r\ncollection of galvanic batteries is thus as necessary a part of the\r\napparatus of the establishment as its graduated circles and arcs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

But there\r\nis another class of sciences in which we endeavor to reduce\r\nphenomena, not evidently mechanical, to a known dependence upon\r\nmechanical properties and laws. In the cases to which I refer, the\r\nfacts do not present themselves to the senses as modifications of\r\nposition and motion, but as _secondary qualities_, which are found\r\nto be in some way derived from those primary attributes. Also, in\r\nthese cases the phenomena are reduced to their mechanical laws and\r\ncauses in a secondary manner; namely, by treating them as the\r\noperation of a _medium_ interposed between the object and the organ\r\nof sense. These, then, we may call _Secondary Mechanical Sciences_.\r\nThe sciences of this kind which require our notice are those which\r\ntreat of the sensible qualities, Sound, Light, and Heat; that is.\r\nAcoustics, Optics, and Thermotics.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that our object is not by any means to give a\r\nfull statement of all the additions which have been successively\r\nmade to our knowledge on the subjects under review, or a complete\r\nlist of the persons by whom such additions have been made; but to\r\npresent a view of the progress of each of those branches of\r\nknowledge _as a theoretical science_;--to point out the Epochs of\r\nthe discovery of those general principles which reduce many facts to\r\none theory; and to note all that is most characteristic and\r\ninstructive in the circumstances and persons which bear upon such\r\nEpochs. A history of any science, written with such objects, will\r\nnot need to be long; but it will fail in its purpose altogether, if\r\nit do not distinctly exhibit some well-marked and prominent\r\nfeatures. {24}\r\n\r\nWe begin our account of the Secondary Mechanical Sciences with\r\nAcoustics, because the progress towards right theoretical views,\r\nwas, in fact, made much earlier in the science of Sound, than in\r\nthose of Light and of Heat; and also, because a clear comprehension\r\nof the theory to which we are led in this case, is the best\r\npreparation for the difficulties (by no means inconsiderable) of the\r\nreasonings of theorists on the other subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN ACOUSTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN some measure the true theory of sound was guessed by very early\r\nspeculators on the subject; though undoubtedly conceived in a very\r\nvague and wavering manner. That sound is caused by some motion of\r\nthe sounding body, and conveyed by some motion of the air to the\r\near, is an opinion which we trace to the earliest times of physical\r\nphilosophy. We may take Aristotle as the best expounder of this\r\nstage of opinion. In his Treatise _On Sound and Hearing_, he says,\r\n\"Sound takes place when bodies strike the air, not by the air having\r\na _form_ impressed upon it (σχηματίζομενον), as some think, but by\r\nits being moved in a corresponding manner; (probably he means in a\r\nmanner corresponding to the impulse;) the air being contracted, and\r\nexpanded, and overtaken, and again struck by the impulses of the\r\nbreath and of the strings. For when the breath falls upon and\r\nstrikes the air which is next it, the air is carried forwards with\r\nan impetus, and that which is contiguous to the first is carried\r\nonwards; so that the same voice spreads every way as far as the\r\nmotion of the air takes place.\"\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all such specimens of ancient physics, different\r\npersons would find in such a statement very different measures of\r\ntruth and distinctness. The admirers of antiquity might easily, by\r\npressing the language closely, and using the light of modern\r\ndiscovery, detect in this passage an exact account of the production\r\nand propagation of sound: while others might maintain that in\r\nAristotle's own mind, there were only vague notions, and verbal\r\ngeneralizations. This {25} latter opinion is very emphatically\r\nexpressed by Bacon.[1\\8] \"The collision or thrusting of air, which\r\nthey will have to be the cause of sound, neither denotes the _form_\r\nnor the latent process of sound; but is a term of ignorance and of\r\nsuperficial contemplation.\" Nor can it be justly denied, that an\r\nexact and distinct apprehension of the kind of motion of the air by\r\nwhich sound is diffused, was beyond the reach of the ancient\r\nphilosophers, and made its way into the world long afterwards. It\r\nwas by no means easy to reconcile the nature of such motion with\r\nobvious phenomena. For the process is not evident as motion; since,\r\nas Bacon also observes,[2\\8] it does not visibly agitate the flame\r\nof a candle, or a feather, or any light floating substance, by which\r\nthe slightest motions of the air are betrayed. Still, the persuasion\r\nthat sound is some motion of the air, continued to keep hold of\r\nmen's minds, and acquired additional distinctness. The illustration\r\nemployed by Vitruvius, in the following passage, is even now one of\r\nthe best we can offer.[3\\8] \"Voice is breath, flowing, and made\r\nsensible to the hearing by striking the air. It moves in infinite\r\ncircumferences of circles, as when, by throwing a stone into still\r\nwater, you produce innumerable circles of waves, increasing from the\r\ncentre and spreading outwards, till the boundary of the space, or\r\nsome obstacle, prevents their outlines from going further. In the\r\nsame manner the voice makes its motion in circles. But in water the\r\ncircle moves breadthways upon a level plain; the voice proceeds in\r\nbreadth, and also successively ascends in height.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\8: _Hist. Son. et Aud._ vol. ix. p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\8: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\8: _De Arch._ v. 3.]\r\n\r\nBoth the comparison, and the notice of the difference of the two\r\ncases, prove the architect to have had very clear notions on the\r\nsubject; which he further shows by comparing the resonance of the\r\nwalls of a building to the disturbance of the outline of the waves\r\nof water when they meet with a boundary, and are thrown back.\r\n\"Therefore, as in the outlines of waves in water, so in the voice,\r\nif no obstacle interrupt the foremost, it does not disturb the\r\nsecond and the following ones, so that all come to the ears of\r\npersons, whether high up or low down, without resonance. But when\r\nthey strike against obstacles, the foremost, being thrown back,\r\ndisturb the lines of those which follow.\" Similar analogies were\r\nemployed by the ancients in order to explain the occurrence of\r\nEchoes. Aristotle says,[4\\8] \"An Echo takes place, when the air,\r\nbeing as one body in consequence of the vessel which bounds it, and\r\nbeing prevented from being thrust forwards, is reflected {26} back\r\nlike a ball.\" Nothing material was added to such views till modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\8: _De Animâ_, ii. 8.]\r\n\r\nThus the first conjectures of those who philosophized concerning\r\nsound, led them to an opinion concerning its causes and laws, which\r\nonly required to be distinctly understood, and traced to mechanical\r\nprinciples, in order to form a genuine science of Acoustics. It was,\r\nno doubt, a work which required a long time and sagacious reasoners,\r\nto supply what was thus wanting; but still, in consequence of this\r\npeculiar circumstance in the early condition of the prevalent\r\ndoctrine concerning sound, the history of Acoustics assumes a\r\npeculiar form. Instead of containing, like the history of Astronomy\r\nor of Optics, a series of generalizations, each including and rising\r\nabove preceding generalizations; in this case, the highest\r\ngeneralization is in view from the first; and the object of the\r\nphilosopher is to determine its precise meaning and circumstances in\r\neach example. Instead of having a series of inductive Truths,\r\nsuccessively dawning on men's minds, we have a series of\r\nExplanations, in which certain experimental facts and laws are\r\nreconciled, as to their mechanical principles and their measures,\r\nwith the general doctrine already in our possession. Instead of\r\nhaving to travel gradually towards a great discovery, like Universal\r\nGravitation, or Luminiferous Undulations, we take our stand upon\r\nacknowledged truths, the production and propagation of sound by the\r\nmotion of bodies and of air; and we connect these with other truths,\r\nthe laws of motion and the known properties of bodies, as, for\r\ninstance, their elasticity. Instead of _Epochs of Discovery_, we\r\nhave _Solutions of Problems_; and to these we must now proceed.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, in the first place, notice that these Problems\r\ninclude other subjects than the mere production and propagation of\r\nsound generally. For such questions as these obviously occur:--what\r\nare the laws and cause of the differences of sounds;--of acute and\r\ngrave, loud and low, continued and instantaneous;--and, again, of\r\nthe differences of articulate sounds, and of the quality of\r\ndifferent voices and different instruments? The first of these\r\nquestions, in particular, the real nature of the difference of acute\r\nand grave sounds, could not help attracting attention; since the\r\ndifference of notes in this respect was the foundation of one of the\r\nmost remarkable mathematical sciences of antiquity. Accordingly, we\r\nfind attempts to explain this difference in the ancient writers on\r\nmusic. In Ptolemy's _Harmonics_, the third Chapter of the first Book\r\nis entitled, \"How the {27} acuteness and graveness of notes is\r\nproduced;\" and in this, after noting generally the difference of\r\nsounds, and the causes of difference (which he states to be the\r\nforce of the striking body, the physical constitution of the body\r\nstruck, and other causes), he comes to the conclusion, that \"the\r\nthings which produce acuteness in sounds, are a greater density and\r\na smaller size; the things which produce graveness, are a greater\r\nrarity and a bulkier form.\" He afterwards explains this so as to\r\ninclude a considerable portion of truth. Thus he says, \"That in\r\nstrings, and in pipes, other things remaining the same, those which\r\nare stopped at the smaller distance from the bridge give the most\r\nacute note; and in pipes, those notes which come through holes\r\nnearest to the mouth-hole are most acute.\" He even attempts a\r\nfurther generalization, and says that the greater acuteness arises,\r\nin fact, from the body being more tense; and that thus \"hardness may\r\ncounteract the effect of greater density, as we see that brass\r\nproduces a more acute sound than lead.\" But this author's notions of\r\ntension, since they were applied so generally as to include both the\r\ntension of a string, and the tension of a piece of solid brass, must\r\nnecessarily have been very vague. And he seems to have been\r\ndestitute of any knowledge of the precise nature of the motion or\r\nimpulse by which sound is produced; and, of course, still more\r\nignorant of the mechanical principles by which these motions are\r\nexplained. The notion of _vibrations_ of the parts of sounding\r\nbodies, does not appear to have been dwelt upon as an essential\r\ncircumstance; though in some cases, as in sounding strings, the fact\r\nis very obvious. And the notion of vibrations of the air does not at\r\nall appear in ancient writers, except so far as it may be conceived\r\nto be implied in the comparison of aërial and watery waves, which we\r\nhave quoted from Vitruvius. It is however, very unlikely that, even\r\nin the case of water, the motions of the particles were distinctly\r\nconceived, for such conception is far from obvious.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to apprehend distinctly, and to explain mechanically,\r\nthe phenomena of sound, gave rise to a series of Problems, of which\r\nwe most now give a brief history. The questions which more peculiarly\r\nconstitute the Science of Acoustics, are the questions concerning\r\nthose motions or affections of the air by which it is the medium of\r\nhearing. But the motions of sounding bodies have both so much\r\nconnexion with those of the medium, and so much resemblance to them,\r\nthat we shall include in our survey researches on that subject also.\r\n{28}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM OF THE VIBRATIONS OF STRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT the continuation of sound depends on a continued minute and\r\nrapid motion, a shaking or trembling, of the parts of the sounding\r\nbody, was soon seen. Thus Bacon says,[5\\8] \"The duration of the\r\nsound of a bell or a string when struck, which appears to be\r\nprolonged and gradually extinguished, does not proceed from the\r\nfirst percussion; but the trepidation of the body struck perpetually\r\ngenerates a new sound. For if that trepidation be prevented, and the\r\nbell or string be stopped, the sound soon dies: as in _spinets_, as\r\nsoon as the _spine_ is let fall so as to touch the string, the sound\r\nceases.\" In the case of a stretched string, it is not difficult to\r\nperceive that the motion is a motion back and forwards across the\r\nstraight line which the string occupies when at rest. The further\r\nexamination of the quantitative circumstances of this oscillatory\r\nmotion was an obvious problem; and especially after oscillations,\r\nthough of another kind (those of a pendulous body), had attracted\r\nattention, as they had done in the school of Galileo. Mersenne, one\r\nof the promulgators of Galileo's philosophy in France, is the first\r\nauthor in whom I find an examination of the details of this case\r\n(_Harmonicorum Liber_, Paris, 1636). He asserts,[6\\8] that the\r\ndifferences and concords of acute and grave sounds depend on the\r\nrapidity of vibrations, and their ratio; and he proves this doctrine\r\nby a series of experimental comparisons. Thus he finds[7\\8] that the\r\nnote of a string is as its length, by taking a string first twice,\r\nand then four times as long as the original string, other things\r\nremaining the same. This, indeed, was known to the ancients, and was\r\nthe basis of that numerical indication of the notes which the\r\nproposition expresses. Mersenne further proceeds to show the effect\r\nof thickness and tension. He finds (Prop. 7) that a string must be\r\nfour times as thick as another, to give the octave below; he finds,\r\nalso (Prop. 8), that the tension must be about four times as great\r\nin order to produce the octave above. From these proportions various\r\nothers are deduced, and the _law of the_ {29} _phenomena_ of this\r\nkind may be considered as determined. Mersenne also undertook to\r\n_measure_ the phenomena numerically, that is to determine the number\r\nof vibrations of the string in each of such cases; which at first\r\nmight appear difficult, since it is obviously impossible to count\r\nwith the eye the passages of a sounding string backwards and\r\nforwards. But Mersenne rightly assumed, that the number of\r\nvibrations is the same so long as the tone is the same, and that the\r\nratios of the numbers of vibrations of different strings may be\r\ndetermined from the numerical relations of their notes. He had,\r\ntherefore, only to determine the number of vibrations of one certain\r\nstring, or one known note, to know those of all others. He took a\r\nmusical string of three-quarters of a foot long, stretched with a\r\nweight of six pounds and five eighths, which he found gave him by\r\nits vibrations a certain standard note in his organ: he found that a\r\nstring of the same material and tension, fifteen feet, that is,\r\ntwenty times as long, made ten recurrences in a second; and he\r\ninferred that the number of vibrations of the shorter string must\r\nalso be twenty times as great; and thus such a string must make in\r\none second of time two hundred vibrations.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\8:  _Hist. Son. et Aud._ vol. ix. p. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\8: L. i. Prop. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\8: L. ii. Prop. 6.]\r\n\r\nThis determination of Mersenne does not appear to have attracted due\r\nnotice; but some time afterwards attempts were made to ascertain the\r\nconnexion between the sound and its elementary pulsations in a more\r\ndirect manner. Hooke, in 1681, produced sounds by the striking of\r\nthe teeth of brass wheels,[8\\8] and Stancari, in 1706, by whirling\r\nround a large wheel in air, showed, before the Academy of Bologna,\r\nhow the number of vibrations in a given note might be known.\r\nSauveur, who, though deaf for the first seven years of his life, was\r\none of the greatest promoters of the science of sound, and gave it\r\nits name of _Acoustics_, endeavored also, about the same time, to\r\ndetermine the number of vibrations of a standard note, or, as he\r\ncalled it, Fixed Sound. He employed two methods, both ingenious and\r\nboth indirect. The first was the method of _beats_. Two organ-pipes,\r\nwhich form a discord, are often heard to produce a kind of _howl_,\r\nor _wavy_ noise, the sound swelling and declining at small intervals\r\nof time. This was readily and rightly ascribed to the coincidences\r\nof the pulsations of sound of the two notes after certain cycles.\r\nThus, if the number of vibrations of the notes were as fifteen to\r\nsixteen in the same time, every fifteenth vibration of the one would\r\ncoincide with every {30} sixteenth vibration of the other, while all\r\nthe intermediate vibrations of the two tones would, in various\r\ndegrees, disagree with each other; and thus every such cycle, of\r\nfifteen and sixteen vibrations, might be heard as a separate beat of\r\nsound. Now, Sauveur wished to take a case in which these beats were\r\nso slow as to be counted,[9\\8] and in which the ratio of the\r\nvibrations of the notes was known from a knowledge of their musical\r\nrelations. Thus if the two notes form an interval of a semitone,\r\ntheir ratio will be that above supposed, fifteen to sixteen; and if\r\nthe beats be found to be six in a second, we know that, in that\r\ntime, the graver note makes ninety and the acuter ninety-six\r\nvibrations. In this manner Sauveur found that an open organ-pipe,\r\nfive feet long, gave one hundred vibrations in a second.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\8: _Life_, p. xxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\8: _Ac. Sc. Hist._ 1700, p. 131.]\r\n\r\nSauveur's other method is more recondite, and approaches to a\r\nmechanical view of the question.[10\\8] He proceeded on this basis; a\r\nstring, horizontally stretched, cannot be drawn into a mathematical\r\nstraight line, but always hangs in a very flat curve, or _festoon_.\r\nHence Sauveur assumed that its transverse vibrations may be\r\nconceived to be identical with the lateral swingings of such a\r\nfestoon. Observing that the string C, in the middle of a\r\nharpsichord, hangs in such a festoon to the amount of 1⁄323rd of an\r\ninch, he calculates, by the laws of pendulums, the time of\r\noscillation, and finds it 1⁄122nd of a second. Thus this C, his\r\n_fixed note_, makes one hundred and twenty-two vibrations in a\r\nsecond. It is curious that this process, seemingly so arbitrary, is\r\ncapable of being justified on mechanical principles; though we can\r\nhardly give the author credit for the views which this justification\r\nimplies. It is, therefore, easy to understand that it agreed with\r\nother experiments, in the laws which it gave for the dependence of\r\nthe tone on the length and tension.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\8: _Ac. Sc. Hist._ 1713.]\r\n\r\nThe problem of satisfactorily explaining this dependence, on\r\nmechanical principles, naturally pressed upon the attention of\r\nmathematicians when the law of the phenomena was thus completely\r\ndetermined by Mersenne and Sauveur. It was desirable to show that\r\nboth the circumstances and the measure of the phenomena were such as\r\nknown mechanical causes and laws would explain. But this problem, as\r\nmight be expected, was not attacked till mechanical principles, and\r\nthe modes of applying them, had become tolerably familiar.\r\n\r\nAs the vibrations of a string are produced by its tension, it\r\nappeared to be necessary, in the first place, to determine the law\r\nof the tension {31} which is called into action by the motion of the\r\nstring; for it is manifest that, when the string is drawn aside from\r\nthe straight line into which it is stretched, there arises an\r\nadditional tension, which aids in drawing it back to the straight\r\nline as soon as it is let go. Hooke (_On Spring_, 1678) determined\r\nthe law of this additional tension, which he expressed in his noted\r\nformula, \"Ut tensio sic vis,\" the Force is as the Tension; or\r\nrather, to express his meaning more clearly, the Force of tension is\r\nas the Extension, or, in a string, as the increase of length. But,\r\nin reality, this principle, which is important in many acoustical\r\nproblems, is, in the one now before us, unimportant; the force which\r\nurges the string towards the straight line, depends, with such small\r\nextensions as we have now to consider, not on the extension, but on\r\nthe curvature; and the power of treating the mathematical difficulty\r\nof curvature, and its mechanical consequences, was what was\r\nrequisite for the solution of this problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem, in its proper aspect, was first attacked and mastered\r\nby Brook Taylor, an English mathematician of the school of Newton,\r\nby whom the solution was published in 1715, in his _Methodus\r\nIncrementorum_. Taylor's solution was indeed imperfect, for it only\r\npointed out a form and a mode of vibration, with which the string\r\n_might_ move consistently with the laws of mechanics; not the mode\r\nin which it _must_ move, supposing its form to be any whatever. It\r\nshowed that the curve might be of the nature of that which is called\r\n_the companion to the cycloid_; and, on the supposition of the curve\r\nof the string being of this form, the calculation confirmed the\r\npreviously established laws by which the tone, or the time of\r\nvibration, had been discovered to depend on the length, tension, and\r\nbulk of the string. The mathematical incompleteness of Taylor's\r\nreasoning must not prevent us from looking upon his solution of the\r\nproblem as the most important step in the progress of this part of\r\nthe subject: for the difficulty of applying mechanical principles to\r\nthe question being once overcome, the extension and correction of\r\nthe application was sure to be undertaken by succeeding\r\nmathematicians; and, accordingly, this soon happened. We may add,\r\nmoreover, that the subsequent and more general solutions require to\r\nbe considered with reference to Taylor's, in order to apprehend\r\ndistinctly their import; and further, that it was almost evident to\r\na mathematician, even before the general solution had appeared, that\r\nthe dependence of the time of vibration on the length and tension,\r\nwould be the same in the general case as in the {32} Taylorian\r\ncurve; so that, for the ends of physical philosophy, the solution\r\nwas not very incomplete.\r\n\r\nJohn Bernoulli, a few years afterwards,[11\\8] solved the problem of\r\nvibrating chords on nearly the same principles and suppositions as\r\nTaylor; but a little later (in 1747), the next generation of great\r\nmathematicians, D'Alembert, Euler, and Daniel Bernoulli, applied the\r\nincreased powers of analysis to give generality to the mode of\r\ntreating this question; and especially the calculus of partial\r\ndifferentials, invented for this purpose. But at this epoch, the\r\ndiscussion, so far as it bore on physics, belonged rather to the\r\nhistory of another problem, which comes under our notice hereafter,\r\nthat of the composition of vibrations; we shall, therefore, defer\r\nthe further history of the problem of vibrating strings, till we\r\nhave to consider it in connexion with new experimental facts.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\8: _Op._ iii. p. 207.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM OF THE PROPAGATION OF SOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen that the ancient philosophers, for the most part, held\r\nthat sound was transmitted, as well as produced, by some motion of\r\nthe air, without defining what kind of motion this was; that some\r\nwriters, however, applied to it a very happy similitude, the\r\nexpansive motion of the circular waves produced by throwing a stone\r\ninto still water; but that notwithstanding, some rejected this mode\r\nof conception, as, for instance, Bacon, who ascribed the\r\ntransmission of sound to certain \"spiritual species.\"\r\n\r\nThough it was an obvious thought to ascribe the motion of sound to\r\nsome motion of air; to conceive what kind of motion could and did\r\nproduce this effect, must have been a matter of grave perplexity at\r\nthe time of which we are speaking; and is far from easy to most\r\npersons even now. We may judge of the difficulty of forming this\r\nconception, when we recollect that John Bernoulli the younger[12\\8]\r\ndeclared, that he could not understand Newton's proposition on this\r\nsubject. The difficulty consists in this; that the movement of the\r\nparts of air, in which sound consists, travels along, but that the\r\nparts {33} of air themselves do not so travel. Accordingly Otto\r\nGuericke,[13\\8] the inventor of the air-pump, asks, \"How can sound\r\nbe conveyed by the motion of the air? when we find that it is better\r\nconveyed through air that is still, than when there is a wind.\" We\r\nmay observe, however, that he was partly misled by finding, as he\r\nthought, that a bell could be heard in the vacuum of his air-pump; a\r\nresult which arose, probably, from some imperfection in his\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\8:_ Prize Dis. on Light_, 1736.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\8: _De Vac. Spat._ p. 138.]\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to determine, by experiment, the circumstances of\r\nthe motion of sound; and especially its velocity. Gassendi[14\\8] was\r\none of the first who did this. He employed fire-arms for the\r\npurpose, and thus found the velocity to be 1473 Paris feet in a\r\nsecond. Roberval found a velocity so small (560 feet) that it threw\r\nuncertainty upon the rest, and affected Newton's reasonings\r\nsubsequently.[15\\8] Cassini, Huyghens, Picard, Römer, found a\r\nvelocity of 1172 Paris feet, which is more accurate than the former.\r\nGassendi had been surprised to find that the velocity with which\r\nsounds travel, is the same whether they are loud or gentle.\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\8: Fischer, _Gesch. d. Physik_. vol. i. 171.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\8: Newt. _Prin._ B. ii. P. 50, Schol.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this constant velocity of sound, and of its\r\namount, was one of the problems of which a solution was given in the\r\nGreat Charter of modern science, Newton's _Principia_ (1687). There,\r\nfor the first time, were explained the real nature of the motions\r\nand mutual action of the parts of the air through which sound is\r\ntransmitted. It was shown[16\\8] that a body vibrating in an elastic\r\nmedium, will propagate _pulses_ through the medium; that is, the parts\r\nof the medium will move forwards and backwards, and this motion will\r\naffect successively those parts which are at a greater and greater\r\ndistance from the origin of motion. The parts, in going forwards,\r\nproduce condensation; in returning to their first places, they allow\r\nextension; and the play of the elasticities developed by these\r\nexpansions and contractions, supplies the forces which continue to\r\npropagate the motion.\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\8: Newt. _Prin._ B. ii. P. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe idea of such a motion as this, is, as we have said, far from\r\neasy to apprehend distinctly: but a distinct apprehension of it is a\r\nstep essential to the physical part of the sciences now under\r\nnotice; for it is by means of such _pulses_, or _undulations_, that\r\nnot only sound, but light, and probably heat, are propagated. We\r\nconstantly meet with evidence of the difficulty which men have in\r\nconceiving this undulatory motion, and in separating it from a local\r\nmotion of the medium as a {34} mass. For instance, it is not easy at\r\nfirst to conceive the waters of a great river flowing constantly\r\n_down_ towards the sea, while waves are rolling _up_ the very same\r\npart of the stream; and while the great elevation, which makes the\r\ntide, is travelling from the sea perhaps with a velocity of fifty\r\nmiles an hour. The motion of such a wave, or elevation, is distinct\r\nfrom any stream, and is of the nature of undulations in general. The\r\nparts of the fluid stir for a short time and for a small distance,\r\nso as to accumulate themselves on a neighboring part, and then\r\nretire to their former place; and this movement affects the parts in\r\nthe order of their places. Perhaps if the reader looks at a field of\r\nstanding corn when gusts of wind are sweeping over it in visible\r\nwaves, he will have his conception of this matter aided; for he will\r\nsee that here, where each ear of grain is anchored by its stalk,\r\nthere can be no permanent local motion of the substance, but only a\r\nsuccessive stooping and rising of the separate straws, producing\r\nhollows and waves, closer and laxer strips of the crowded ears.\r\n\r\nNewton had, moreover, to consider the mechanical consequences which\r\nsuch condensations and rarefactions of the elastic medium, air,\r\nwould produce in the parts of the fluid itself. Employing known laws\r\nof the elasticity of air, he showed, in a very remarkable\r\nproposition,[17\\8] the law according to which the particles of air\r\nmight vibrate. We may observe, that in this solution, as in that of\r\nthe vibrating string already mentioned, a rule was exhibited\r\naccording to which the particles _might_ oscillate, but not the law\r\nto which they _must_ conform. It was proved that, by taking the\r\nmotion of each particle to be perfectly similar to that of a\r\npendulum, the forces, developed by contraction and expansion, were\r\nprecisely such as the motion required; but it was not shown that no\r\nother type of oscillation would give rise to the same accordance of\r\nforce and motion. Newton's reasoning also gave a determination of\r\nthe speed of propagation of the pulses: it appeared that sound ought\r\nto travel with the velocity which a body would acquire by falling\r\nfreely through half _the height of a homogeneous atmosphere_; \"the\r\nheight of a homogeneous atmosphere\" being the height which the air\r\nmust have, in order to produce, at the earth's surface, the actual\r\natmospheric pressure, supposing no diminution of density to take\r\nplace in ascending. This height is about 29,000 feet; and hence it\r\nfollowed that the velocity was 968 feet. This velocity is really\r\nconsiderably less than that of sound; but at the time of which {35}\r\nwe speak, no accurate measure had been established; and Newton\r\npersuaded himself, by experiments made in the cloister of Trinity\r\nCollege, his residence, that his calculation was not far from the\r\nfact. When, afterwards, more exact experiments showed the velocity\r\nto be 1142 English feet, Newton attempted to explain the difference\r\nby various considerations, none of which were adequate to the\r\npurpose;--as, the dimensions of the solid particles of which the\r\nfluid air consists;--or the vapors which are mixed with it. Other\r\nwriters offered other suggestions; but the true solution of the\r\ndifficulty was reserved for a period considerably subsequent.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\8: _Princ._ B. ii. P. 48.]\r\n\r\nNewton's calculation of the motion of sound, though logically\r\nincomplete, was the great step in the solution of the problem; for\r\nmathematicians could not but presume that his result was not\r\nrestricted to the hypothesis on which he had obtained it; and the\r\nextension of the solution required only mere ordinary talents. The\r\nlogical defect of his solution was assailed, as might have been\r\nexpected. Cranmer (professor at Geneva), in 1741, conceived that he\r\nwas destroying the conclusiveness of Newton's reasoning, by showing\r\nthat it applied equally to other modes of oscillation. This, indeed,\r\ncontradicted the enunciation of the 48th Prop. of the Second Book of\r\nthe _Principia_; but it confirmed and extended all the general\r\nresults of the demonstration; for it left even the velocity of sound\r\nunaltered, and thus showed that the velocity did not depend\r\nmechanically on the type of the oscillation. But the satisfactory\r\nestablishment of this physical generalization was to be supplied\r\nfrom the vast generalizations of analysis, which mathematicians were\r\nnow becoming able to deal with. Accordingly this task was performed\r\nby the great master of analytical generalization, Lagrange, in 1759,\r\nwhen, at the age of twenty-three, he and two friends published the\r\nfirst volume of the _Turin Memoirs_. Euler, as his manner was, at\r\nonce perceived the merit of the new solution, and pursued the\r\nsubject on the views thus suggested. Various analytical improvements\r\nand extensions were introduced into the solution by the two great\r\nmathematicians; but none of these at all altered the formula by\r\nwhich the velocity of sound was expressed; and the discrepancy\r\nbetween calculation and observation, about one-sixth of the whole,\r\nwhich had perplexed Newton, remained still unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nThe merit of satisfactorily explaining this discrepancy belongs to\r\nLaplace. He was the first to remark[18\\8] that the common law of the\r\n{36} changes of elasticity in the air, as dependent on its\r\ncompression, cannot be applied to those rapid vibrations in which\r\nsound consists, since the sudden compression produces a degree of\r\nheat which additionally increases the elasticity. The ratio of this\r\nincrease depended on the experiments by which the relation of heat\r\nand air is established. Laplace, in 1816, published[19\\8] the\r\ntheorem on which the correction depends. On applying it, the\r\ncalculated velocity of sound agreed very closely with the best\r\nantecedent experiments, and was confirmed by more exact ones\r\ninstituted for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\8: _Méc. Cél._ t. v. l. xii. p. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\8: _Ann. Phys. et Chim._ t. iii. p. 288.]\r\n\r\nThis step completes the solution of the problem of the propagation\r\nof sound, as a mathematical induction, obtained from, and verified\r\nby, facts. Most of the discussions concerning points of analysis to\r\nwhich the investigations on this subject gave rise, as, for\r\ninstance, the admissibility of _discontinuous functions_ into the\r\nsolutions of partial differential equations, belong to the history\r\nof pure mathematics. Those which really concern the physical theory\r\nof sound may be referred to the problem of the motion of air in\r\ntubes, to which we shall soon have to proceed; but we must first\r\nspeak of another form which the problem of vibrating strings assumed.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be noticed that the ultimate result of the study of\r\nthe undulations of fluids seems to show that the comparison of the\r\nmotion of air in the diffusion of sound with the motion of circular\r\nwaves from a centre in water, which is mentioned at the beginning of\r\nthis chapter, though pertinent in a certain way, is not exact. It\r\nappears by Mr. Scott's recent investigations concerning waves,[20\\8]\r\nthat the circular waves are oscillating waves of the Second order,\r\nand are _gregarious_. The sound-wave seems rather to resemble the\r\ngreat solitary Wave of Translation of the First order, of which we\r\nhave already spoken in Book vi. chapter vi.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\8: _Brit. Ass. Reports for_ 1844, p. 361.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE SAME STRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT had been observed at an early period of acoustical knowledge,\r\nthat one string might give several sounds. Mersenne and others {37}\r\nhad noticed[21\\8] that when a string vibrates, one which is in\r\nunison with it vibrates without being touched. He was also aware\r\nthat this was true if the second string was an octave or a twelfth\r\nbelow the first. This was observed as a new fact in England in 1674,\r\nand communicated to the Royal Society by Wallis.[22\\8] But the later\r\nobservers ascertained further, that the longer string divides itself\r\ninto two, or into three equal parts, separated by _nodes_, or points\r\nof rest; this they proved by hanging bits of paper on different\r\nparts of the string. The discovery so modified was again made by\r\nSauveur[23\\8] about 1700. The sounds thus produced in one string by\r\nthe vibration of another, have been termed _Sympathetic Sounds_.\r\nSimilar sounds are often produced by performers on stringed\r\ninstruments, by touching the string at one of its aliquot divisions,\r\nand are then called the _Acute harmonics_. Such facts were not\r\ndifficult to explain on Taylor's view of the mechanical condition of\r\nthe string; but the difficulty was increased when it was noticed\r\nthat a sounding body could produce these different notes _at the\r\nsame time_. Mersenne had remarked this, and the fact was more\r\ndistinctly observed and pursued by Sauveur. The notes thus produced\r\nin addition to the genuine note of the string, have been called\r\n_Secondary Notes_; those usually heard are, the Octave, the Twelfth,\r\nand the Seventeenth above the note itself. To supply a mode of\r\nconceiving distinctly, and explaining mechanically, vibrations which\r\nshould allow of such an effect, was therefore a requisite step in\r\nacoustics.\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\8: _Harm._ lib. iv. Prop. 28 (1636).]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\8: _Ph. Tr._ 1677, April.]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\8: _A. P._ 1701.]\r\n\r\nThis task was performed by Daniel Bernoulli in a memoir published in\r\n1755.[24\\8] He there stated and proved the Principle of _the\r\ncoexistence of small vibrations_. It was already established, that a\r\nstring might vibrate either in a single _swelling_ (if we use this\r\nword to express the curve between two nodes which Bernoulli calls a\r\n_ventre_), or in two or three or any number of equal swellings with\r\nimmoveable nodes between. Daniel Bernoulli showed further, that\r\nthese nodes might be combined, each taking place as if it were the\r\nonly one. This appears sufficient to explain the coexistence of the\r\nharmonic sounds just noticed. D'Alembert, indeed, in the article\r\n_Fundamental_ in the French _Encyclopédie_, and Lagrange in his\r\n_Dissertation on Sound_ in the _Turin Memoirs_,[25\\8] offer several\r\nobjections to this explanation; and it cannot be denied that the\r\nsubject has its difficulties; but {38} still these do not deprive\r\nBernoulli of the merit of having pointed out the principle of\r\nCoexistent Vibrations, or divest that principle of its value in\r\nphysical science.\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\8: _Berlin Mem._ 1753, p. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\8: T. i. pp. 64, 103.]\r\n\r\nDaniel Bernoulli's Memoir, of which we speak, was published at a\r\nperiod when the clouds which involve the general analytical\r\ntreatment of the problem of vibrating strings, were thickening about\r\nEuler and D'Alembert, and darkening into a controversial hue; and as\r\nBernoulli ventured to interpose his view, as a solution of these\r\ndifficulties, which, in a mathematical sense, it is not, we can\r\nhardly be surprised that he met with a rebuff. The further\r\nprosecution of the different modes of vibration of the same body\r\nneed not be here considered.\r\n\r\nThe sounds which are called _Grave Harmonics_, have no analogy with\r\nthe Acute Harmonics above-mentioned; nor do they belong to this\r\nsection; for in the case of Grave Harmonics, we have one sound from\r\nthe co-operation of two strings, instead of several sounds from one\r\nstring. These harmonics are, in fact, connected with beats, of which\r\nwe have already spoken; the beats becoming so close as to produce a\r\nnote of definite musical quality. The discovery of the Grave\r\nHarmonics is usually ascribed to Tartini, who mentions them in 1754;\r\nbut they are first noticed[26\\8] in the work of Sorge _On tuning\r\nOrgans_, 1744. He there expresses this discovery in a query. \"Whence\r\ncomes it, that if we tune a fifth (2 : 3), a _third_ sound is\r\nfaintly heard, the octave below the lower of the two notes? Nature\r\nshows that with 2 : 3, she still requires the unity, to perfect the\r\norder 1, 2, 3.\" The truth is, that these numbers express the\r\nfrequency of the vibrations, and thus there will be coincidences of\r\nthe notes 2 and 3, which are of the frequency 1, and consequently\r\ngive the octave below the sound 2. This is the explanation given by\r\nLagrange,[27\\8] and is indeed obvious.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\8: Chladni. _Acoust._ p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\8: _Mem. Tur._ i. p. 104.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM OF THE SOUNDS OF PIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was taken for granted by those who reasoned on sounds, that the\r\nsounds of flutes, organ-pipes, and wind-instruments in general, {39}\r\nconsisted in vibrations of some kind; but to determine the nature\r\nand laws of these vibrations, and to reconcile them with mechanical\r\nprinciples, was far from easy. The leading facts which had been\r\nnoticed were, that the note of a pipe was proportional to its\r\nlength, and that a flute and similar instruments might be made to\r\nproduce some of the acute harmonics, as well as the genuine note. It\r\nhad further been noticed,[28\\8] that pipes closed at the end,\r\ninstead of giving the series of harmonics 1, ½, ⅓, ¼, &c., would\r\ngive only those notes which answer to the odd numbers 1, ⅓, ⅕, &c.\r\nIn this problem also, Newton[29\\8] made the first step to the\r\nsolution. At the end of the propositions respecting the velocity of\r\nsound, of which we have spoken, he noticed that it appeared by\r\ntaking Mersenne's or Sauveur's determination of the number of\r\nvibrations corresponding to a given note, that the pulse of air runs\r\nover twice the length of the pipe in the time of each vibration. He\r\ndoes not follow out this observation, but it obviously points to the\r\ntheory, that the sound of a pipe consists of pulses which travel\r\nback and forwards along its length, and are kept in motion by the\r\nbreath of the player. This supposition would account for the\r\nobserved dependence of the note on the length of the pipe. The\r\nsubject does not appear to have been again taken up in a theoretical\r\nway till about 1760; when Lagrange in the second volume of the\r\n_Turin Memoirs_, and D. Bernoulli in the _Memoirs of the French\r\nAcademy_ for 1762, published important essays, in which some of the\r\nleading facts were satisfactorily explained, and which may therefore\r\nbe considered as the principal solutions of the problem.\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\8: D. Bernoulli, _Berlin. Mem._ 1753, p. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\8: _Princip._ Schol. Prop. 50.]\r\n\r\nIn these solutions there was necessarily something hypothetical. In\r\nthe case of vibrating strings, as we have seen, the Form of the\r\nvibrating curve was guessed at only, but the existence and position\r\nof the Nodes could be rendered visible to the eye. In the vibrations\r\nof air, we cannot see either the places of nodes, or the mode of\r\nvibration; but several of the results are independent of these\r\ncircumstances. Thus both of the solutions explain the fact, that a\r\ntube closed at one end is in unison with an open tube of double the\r\nlength; and, by supposing nodes to occur, they account for the\r\nexistence of the odd series of harmonics alone, 1, 3, 5, in closed\r\ntubes, while the whole series, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c., occurs in open\r\nones. Both views of the nature of the vibration appear to be nearly\r\nthe same; though Lagrange's is expressed with an analytical\r\ngenerality which renders it obscure, and Bernoulli has perhaps {40}\r\nlaid down an hypothesis more special than was necessary.\r\nLagrange[30\\8] considers the vibration of open flutes as \"the\r\noscillations of a fibre of air,\" under the condition that its\r\nelasticity at the two ends is, during the whole oscillation, the\r\nsame as that of the surrounding atmosphere. Bernoulli supposes[31\\8]\r\nthe whole inertia of the air in the flute to be collected into one\r\nparticle, and this to be moved by the whole elasticity arising from\r\nthis displacement. It may be observed that both these modes of\r\ntreating the matter come very near to what we have stated as\r\nNewton's theory; for though Bernoulli supposes all the air in the\r\nflute to be moved at once, and not successively, as by Newton's\r\npulse, in either case the whole elasticity moves the whole air in\r\nthe tube, and requires more time to do this according to its\r\nquantity. Since that time, the subject has received further\r\nmathematical developement from Euler,[32\\8] Lambert,[33\\8] and\r\nPoisson;[34\\8] but no new explanation of facts has arisen. Attempts\r\nhave however been made to ascertain experimentally the places of the\r\nnodes. Bernoulli himself had shown that this place was affected by\r\nthe amount of the opening, and Lambert[35\\8] had examined other\r\ncases with the same view. Savart traced the node in various musical\r\npipes under different conditions; and very recently Mr. Hopkins, of\r\nCambridge, has pursued the same experimental inquiry.[36\\8] It\r\nappears from these researches, that the early assumptions of\r\nmathematicians with regard to the position of the nodes, are not\r\nexactly verified by the facts. When the air in a pipe is made to\r\nvibrate so as to have several nodes which divide it into equal\r\nparts, it had been supposed by acoustical writers that the part\r\nadjacent to the open end was half of the other parts; the outermost\r\nnode, however, is found experimentally to be _displaced_ from the\r\nposition thus assigned to it, by a quantity depending on several\r\ncollateral circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\8: _Mém. Turin_, vol. ii. p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\8: _Mém. Berlin_, 1753, p. 446.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\8: _Nov. Act. Petrop._ tom. xvi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\8: _Acad. Berlin_, 1775.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\5: _Journ. Ec. Polyt._ cap. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\8: _Acad. Berlin_, 1775.]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\8: _Camb. Trans._ vol. v. p. 234.]\r\n\r\nSince our purpose was to consider this problem only so far as it has\r\ntended towards its mathematical solution, we have avoided saying\r\nanything of the dependence of the mode of vibration on the cause by\r\nwhich the sound is produced; and consequently, the researches on the\r\neffects of reeds, embouchures, and the like, by Chladni, Savart,\r\nWillis, and others, do not belong to our subject. It is easily seen\r\nthat the complex effect of the elasticity and other properties of\r\nthe reed and of the air together, is a problem of which we can\r\nhardly {41} hope to give a complete solution till our knowledge has\r\nadvanced much beyond its present condition.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in the science of Acoustics there is a vast body of facts to\r\nwhich we might apply what has just been said; but for the sake of\r\npointing out some of them, we shall consider them as the subjects of\r\none extensive and yet unsolved problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM OF DIFFERENT MODES OF VIBRATION OF BODIES IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT only the objects of which we have spoken hitherto, strings and\r\npipes, but almost all bodies are capable of vibration. Bells, gongs,\r\ntuning-forks, are examples of solid bodies; drums and tambourines,\r\nof membranes; if we run a wet finger along the edge of a glass\r\ngoblet, we throw the fluid which it contains into a regular\r\nvibration; and the various character which sounds possess according\r\nto the room in which they are uttered, shows that large masses of\r\nair have peculiar modes of vibration. Vibrations are generally\r\naccompanied by sound, and they may, therefore, be considered as\r\nacoustical phenomena, especially as the sound is one of the most\r\ndecisive facts in indicating the mode of vibration. Moreover, every\r\nbody of this kind can vibrate in many different ways, the vibrating\r\nsegments being divided by Nodal Lines and Surfaces of various form\r\nand number. The mode of vibration, selected by the body in each\r\ncase, is determined by the way in which it is held, the way in which\r\nit is set in vibration, and the like circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe general problem of such vibrations includes the discovery and\r\nclassification of the phenomena; the detection of their formal laws;\r\nand, finally, the explanation of these on mechanical principles. We\r\nmust speak very briefly of what has been done in these ways. The\r\nfacts which indicate Nodal Lines had been remarked by Galileo, on\r\nthe sounding board of a musical instrument; and Hooke had proposed\r\nto observe the vibrations of a bell by strewing flour upon it. But\r\nit was Chladni, a German philosopher, who enriched acoustics with\r\nthe discovery of the vast variety of symmetrical figures of Nodal\r\nLines, which are exhibited on plates of regular forms, when {42}\r\nmade to sound. His first investigations on this subject,\r\n_Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klangs_, were published 1787; and\r\nin 1802 and 1817 he added other discoveries. In these works he not\r\nonly related a vast number of new and curious facts, but in some\r\nmeasure reduced some of them to order and law. For instance, he has\r\ntraced all the vibrations of square plates to a resemblance with\r\nthose forms of vibration in which Nodal Lines are parallel to one\r\nside of the square, and those in which they are parallel to another\r\nside; and he has established a notation for the modes of vibration\r\nfounded on this classification. Thus, 5-2 denotes a form in which\r\nthere are five nodal lines parallel to one side, and two to another;\r\nor a form which can be traced to a disfigurement of such a standard\r\ntype. Savart pursued this subject still further; and traced, by\r\nactual observation, the forms of the Nodal Surfaces which divide\r\nsolid bodies, and masses of air, when in a state of vibration.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of such vibrations upon their physical cause, namely,\r\nthe elasticity of the substance, we can conceive in a general way;\r\nbut the mathematical theory of such cases is, as might be supposed,\r\nvery difficult, even if we confine ourselves to the obvious question\r\nof the mechanical possibility of these different modes of vibration,\r\nand leave out of consideration their dependence upon the mode of\r\nexcitation. The transverse vibrations of elastic rods, plates, and\r\nrings, had been considered by Euler in 1779; but his calculation\r\nconcerning plates had foretold only a small part of the curious\r\nphenomena observed by Chladni;[37\\8] and the several notes which,\r\naccording to his calculation, the same ring ought to give, were not\r\nin agreement with experiment.[38\\8] Indeed, researches of this kind,\r\nas conducted by Euler, and other authors,[39\\8] rather were, and\r\nwere intended for, examples of analytical skill, than explanations\r\nof physical facts. James Bernoulli, after the publication of\r\nChladni's experiments in 1787, attempted to solve the problem for\r\nplates, by treating a plate as a collection of fibres; but, as\r\nChladni observes, the justice of this mode of conception is\r\ndisproved, by the disagreement of the results with experiment.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\8: Fischer, vi. 587.]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\8: Ib. vi. 596.]\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\8: See Chladni, p. 474.]\r\n\r\nThe Institute of France, which had approved of Chladni's labours,\r\nproposed, in 1809, the problem now before us as a\r\nprize-question:[40\\8]--\"To give the mathematical theory of the\r\nvibrations of elastic {43} surfaces, and to compare it with\r\nexperiment.\" Only one memoir was sent in as a candidate for the\r\nprize; and this was not crowned, though honorable mention was made\r\nof it.[41\\8] The formulæ of James Bernoulli were, according to M.\r\nPoisson's statement, defective, in consequence of his not taking\r\ninto account the normal force which acts at the exterior boundary of\r\nthe plate.[42\\8] The author of the anonymous memoir corrected this\r\nerror, and calculated the note corresponding to various figures of\r\nthe nodal lines; and he found an agreement with experiment\r\nsufficient to justify his theory. He had not, however, proved his\r\nfundamental equation, which M. Poisson demonstrated in a Memoir,\r\nread in 1814.[43\\8] At a more recent period also, MM. Poisson and\r\nCauchy (as well as a lady, Mlle. Sophie Germain) have applied to\r\nthis problem the artifices of the most improved analysis. M.\r\nPoisson[44\\8] determined the relation of the notes given by the\r\nlongitudinal and the transverse vibrations of a rod; and solved the\r\nproblem of vibrating circular plates when the nodal lines are\r\nconcentric circles. In both these cases, the numerical agreement of\r\nhis results with experience, seemed to confirm the justice of his\r\nfundamental views.[45\\8] He proceeds upon the hypothesis, that\r\nelastic bodies are composed of separate particles held together by\r\nthe attractive forces which they exert upon each other, and\r\ndistended by the repulsive force of heat. M. Cauchy[46\\8] has also\r\ncalculated the transverse, longitudinal, and rotatory vibrations of\r\nelastic rods, and has obtained results agreeing closely with\r\nexperiment through a considerable list of comparisons. The combined\r\nauthority of two profound analysts, as MM. Poisson and Cauchy are,\r\nleads us to believe that, for the simpler cases of the vibrations of\r\nelastic bodies, Mathematics has executed her task; but most of the\r\nmore complex cases remain as yet unsubdued.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\8: See Chladni, p. 357.]\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\8: Poisson's _Mém. in Ac. Sc._ 1812, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\8: Ib. p. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\8: Ib. 1812, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\8: Ib. t. viii. 1829.]\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\8: _An. Chim._ tom. xxxvi. 1827, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\8: _Exercices de Mathématique_, iii. and iv.]\r\n\r\nThe two brothers, Ernest and William Weber, made many curious\r\nobservations on undulations, which are contained in their\r\n_Wellenlehre_, (Doctrine of Waves,) published at Leipsig in 1825.\r\nThey were led to suppose, (as Young had suggested at an earlier\r\nperiod,) that Chladni's figures of nodal lines in plates were to be\r\naccounted for by the superposition of undulations.[47\\8] Mr.\r\nWheatstone[48\\8] has undertaken to account for Chladni's figures of\r\nvibrating _square_ plates by this {44} superposition of two or more\r\nsimple and obviously allowable modes of nodal division, which have\r\nthe same time of vibration. He assumes, for this purpose, certain\r\n\"primary figures,\" containing only _parallel_ nodal lines; and by\r\ncombining these, first in twos, and then in fours, he obtains most\r\nof Chladni's observed figures, and accounts for their transitions\r\nand deviations from regularity.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\8: _Wellenlehre_, p. 474.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\8: _Phil. Trans._ 1833, p. 593.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the superposition of vibrations is so solidly\r\nestablished as a mechanical truth, that we may consider an\r\nacoustical problem as satisfactorily disposed of when it is reduced\r\nto that principle, as well as when it is solved by analytical\r\nmechanics: but at the same time we may recollect, that the right\r\napplication and limitation of this law involves no small difficulty;\r\nand in this case, as in all advances in physical science, we cannot\r\nbut wish to have the new ground which has been gained, gone over by\r\nsome other person in some other manner; and thus secured to us as a\r\npermanent possession.\r\n\r\n_Savart's Laws._--In what has preceded, the vibrations of bodies\r\nhave been referred to certain general classes, the separation of\r\nwhich was suggested by observation; for example, the _transverse_,\r\n_longitudinal_, and _rotatory_,[49\\8] vibrations of rods. The\r\ntransverse vibrations, in which the rod goes backwards and forwards\r\nacross the line of its length, were the only ones noticed by the\r\nearlier acousticians: the others were principally brought into\r\nnotice by Chladni. As we have already seen in the preceding pages,\r\nthis classification serves to express important laws; as, for\r\ninstance, a law obtained by M. Poisson which gives the relation of\r\nthe notes produced by the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of\r\na rod. But this distinction was employed by M. Felix Savart to\r\nexpress laws of a more general kind; and then, as often happens in\r\nthe progress of science, by pursuing these laws to a higher point of\r\ngenerality, the distinction again seemed to vanish. A very few words\r\nwill explain these steps.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\8: Vibrations tournantes.]\r\n\r\nIt was long ago known that vibrations may be communicated by\r\ncontact. The distinction of transverse and longitudinal vibrations\r\nbeing established, Savart found that if one rod touched another\r\nperpendicularly, the longitudinal vibrations of the first occasion\r\ntransverse vibrations in the second, and _vice versâ_. This is the\r\nmore remarkable, since the two sets of vibrations are not equal in\r\nrapidity, and therefore cannot sympathize in any obvious\r\nmanner.[50\\8] Savart found himself {45} able to generalize this\r\nproposition, and to assert that in any combination of rods, strings,\r\nand laminæ, at right angles to each other, the longitudinal and\r\ntransverse vibrations affect respectively the rods in the one and\r\nother direction,[51\\8] so that when the horizontal rods, for example,\r\nvibrate in the one way, the vertical rods vibrate in the other.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\8: _An. Chim._ 1819, tom. xiv. p. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\8: _An. Chim._ p. 152.]\r\n\r\nThis law was thus expressed in terms of that classification of\r\nvibrations of which we have spoken. Yet we easily see that we may\r\nexpress it in a more general manner, without referring to that\r\nclassification, by saying, that vibrations are communicated so as\r\nalways to be parallel to their original direction. And by following\r\nit out in this shape by means of experiment, M. Savart was led, a\r\nshort time afterwards, to deny that there is any essential\r\ndistinction in these different kinds of vibration. \"We are thus\r\nled,\" he says[52\\8] in 1822, \"to consider _normal_ [transverse]\r\nvibrations as only one circumstance in a more general motion common\r\nto all bodies, analogous to _tangential_ [longitudinal and rotatory]\r\nvibrations; that is, as produced by small _molecular oscillations_,\r\nand differently modified according to the direction which it\r\naffects, relatively to the dimensions of the vibrating body.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\8: Ib. t. xxv. p. 33.]\r\n\r\nThese \"inductions,\" as he properly calls them, are supported by a\r\ngreat mass of ingenious experiments; and may be considered as well\r\nestablished, when they are limited to molecular oscillations,\r\nemploying this phrase in the sense in which it is understood in the\r\nabove statement; and also when they are confined to bodies in which\r\nthe play of elasticity is not interrupted by parts more rigid than\r\nthe rest, as the sound-post of a violin.[53\\8] And before I quit the\r\nsubject, I may notice a consequence which M. Savart has deduced from\r\nhis views, and which, at first sight, appears to overturn most of\r\nthe earlier doctrines respecting vibrating bodies. It was formerly\r\nheld that tense strings and elastic rods could vibrate only in a\r\ndeterminate series of modes of division, with no intermediate steps.\r\nBut M. Savart maintains,[54\\8] on the contrary, that they produce\r\nsounds which are gradually transformed into one another, by\r\nindefinite intermediate degrees. The reader may naturally ask, what\r\nis the solution of this apparent {46} contradiction between the\r\nearliest and the latest discoveries in acoustics. And the answer\r\nmust be, that these intermediate modes of vibration are complex in\r\ntheir nature, and difficult to produce; and that those which were\r\nformerly believed to be the only possible vibrating conditions, are\r\nso eminent above all the rest by their features, their simplicity,\r\nand their facility, that we may still, for common purposes, consider\r\nthem as a class apart; although for the sake of reaching a general\r\ntheorem, we may associate them with the general mass of cases of\r\nmolecular vibrations. And thus we have no exception here, as we can\r\nhave none in any case, to our maxim, that what formed part of the\r\nearly discoveries of science, forms part of its latest systems.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\8: For the suggestion of the necessity of this limitation I\r\nam indebted to Mr. Willis.]\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\8: _An. Chim._ 1826, t. xxxii. p. 384.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus surveyed the progress of the science of sound up to\r\nrecent times, with respect both to the discovery of laws of\r\nphenomena, and the reduction of these to their mechanical causes.\r\nThe former branch of the science has necessarily been inductively\r\npursued; and therefore has been more peculiarly the subject of our\r\nattention. And this consideration will explain why we have not dwelt\r\nmore upon the deductive labors of the great analysts who have\r\ntreated of this problem.\r\n\r\nTo those who are acquainted with the high and deserved fame which\r\nthe labors of D'Alembert, Euler, Lagrange, and others, upon this\r\nsubject, enjoy among mathematicians, it may seem as if we had not\r\ngiven them their due prominence in our sketch. But it is to be\r\nrecollected here, as we have already observed in the case of\r\nhydrodynamics, that even when the general principles are\r\nuncontested, mere mathematical deductions from them do not belong to\r\nthe history of physical science, except when they point out laws\r\nwhich are intermediate between the general principle and the\r\nindividual facts, and which observation may confirm.\r\n\r\nThe business of constructing any science may be figured as the task\r\nof forming a road on which our reason can travel through a certain\r\nprovince of the external world. We have to throw a bridge which may\r\nlead from the chambers of our own thoughts, from our speculative\r\nprinciples, to the distant shore of material facts. But in all cases\r\nthe abyss is too wide to be crossed, except we can find some\r\nintermediate points on which the piers of our structure may rest.\r\nMere facts, without connexion or law, are only the rude stones hewn\r\nfrom the opposite bank, of which our arches may, at some time, be\r\nbuilt. But mere hypothetical mathematical calculations are only\r\nplans of projected structures; and those plans which exhibit only\r\none vast {47} and single arch, or which suppose no support but that\r\nwhich our own position supplies, will assuredly never become\r\nrealities. We must have a firm basis of intermediate generalizations\r\nin order to frame a continuous and stable edifice.\r\n\r\nIn the subject before us, we have no want of such points of\r\nintermediate support, although they are in many instances\r\nirregularly distributed and obscurely seen. The number of observed\r\nlaws and relations of the phenomena of sound, is already very great;\r\nand though the time may be distant, there seems to be no reason to\r\ndespair of one day uniting them by clear ideas of mechanical\r\ncausation, and thus of making acoustics a perfect secondary\r\nmechanical science.\r\n\r\nThe historical sketch just given includes only such parts of\r\nacoustics as have been in some degree reduced to general laws and\r\nphysical causes; and thus excludes much that is usually treated of\r\nunder that head. Moreover, many of the numerical calculations\r\nconnected with sound belong to its agreeable effect upon the ear; as\r\nthe properties of the various systems of _Temperament_. These are\r\nparts of Theoretical Music, not of Acoustics; of the Philosophy of\r\nthe Fine Arts, not of Physical Science; and may be referred to in a\r\nfuture portion of this work, so far as they bear upon our object.\r\n\r\nThe science of Acoustics may, however, properly consider other\r\ndifferences of sound than those of acute and grave,--for instance,\r\nthe _articulate_ differences, or those by which the various letters\r\nare formed. Some progress has been made in reducing this part of the\r\nsubject to general rules; for though Kempelen's \"talking machine\"\r\nwas only a work of art, Mr. Willis's machine,[55\\8] which exhibits\r\nthe relation among the vowels, gives us a law such as forms a step\r\nin science. We may, however, consider this instrument as a\r\n_phthongometer_, or measure of vowel quality; and in that point of\r\nview we shall have to refer to it again when we come to speak of\r\nsuch measures.\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\8: On the Vowel Sounds, and on Reed Organ-pipes. _Camb.\r\nTrans._ iii. 237.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{49}}\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SECONDARY MECHANICAL SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n(CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF OPTICS,\r\n\r\nFORMAL AND PHYSICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ω Διὸς ὑψιμέλαθρον ἔχων κράτος αἰὲν ἀτειρὲς\r\n  Ἄστρων, Ἠελίου τε, Σεληναίης τε μέρισμα\r\n  Πανδαμάτωρ, πυρίπνου, πᾶσιν ζωοῖσιν ἔναυσμα\r\n  **Ὑψιφάνης ἌIϴΗΡ, κόσμου στοιχεῖον, **ἄριστον·\r\n  Ἀγλαὸν ὦ βλάστημα, σελασφόρον, ἀστεροφεγγὲς\r\n  Κικλήσκων λίτομαι σε, κεκραμένον **εὔδιον εἶναι.\r\n          ORPHEUS.

In this way Optics is peculiarly\r\ninstructive; the more so, as its history has followed a course in\r\nsome respects different from both the sciences previously reviewed.\r\nAstronomy, as we have seen, advanced with a steady and continuous\r\nmovement from one generation to another, from the earliest time,\r\ntill her career was crowned by the great unforeseen discovery of\r\nNewton; Acoustics had her extreme generalization in view from the\r\nfirst, and her history consists in the correct application of it to\r\nsuccessive problems; Optics advanced through a scale of\r\ngeneralizations as remarkable as those of Astronomy; but for a long\r\nperiod she was almost stationary; and, at last, was rapidly impelled\r\nthrough all those stages by the energy of two or three discoverers.\r\nThe highest point of generality which Optics has reached is little\r\ndifferent from that which Acoustics occupied at once; but in the\r\nolder and earlier science we still want that palpable and pointed\r\nconfirmation of the general principle, which the undulatory theory\r\nreceives from optical phenomena. Astronomy has amassed her vast\r\nfortune by long-continued industry and labor; Optics has obtained\r\nhers in a few years by sagacious and happy speculations; Acoustics,\r\nhaving early acquired a competence, has since been employed rather\r\nin improving and adorning than in extending her estate.\r\n\r\nThe successive inductions by which Optics made her advances, might,\r\nof course, be treated in the same manner as those of Astronomy, each\r\nhaving its prelude and its sequel. But most of the discoveries in\r\nOptics are of a smaller character, and have less employed the minds\r\nof men, than those of Astronomy; and it will not be necessary to\r\nexhibit them in this detailed manner, till we come to the great\r\ngeneralization by which the theory was established. I shall,\r\ntherefore, now pass rapidly in review the earlier optical\r\ndiscoveries, without any such division of the series. {52}\r\n\r\nOptics, like Astronomy, has for its object of inquiry, first, the\r\nlaws of phenomena, and next, their causes; and we may hence divide\r\nthis science, like the other, into _Formal Optics_ and _Physical\r\nOptics_. The distinction is clear and substantive, but it is not\r\neasy to adhere to it in our narrative; for, after the theory had\r\nbegun to make its rapid advance, many of the laws of phenomena were\r\nstudied and discovered in immediate reference to the theoretical\r\ncause, and do not occupy a separate place in the history of science,\r\nas in Astronomy they do. We may add, that the reason why Formal\r\nAstronomy was almost complete before Physical Astronomy began to\r\nexist, was, that it was necessary to construct the science of\r\nMechanics in the mean time, in order to be able to go on; whereas,\r\nin Optics, mathematicians were able to calculate the results of the\r\nundulatory theory as soon as it had suggested itself from the earlier\r\nfacts, and while the great mass of facts were only becoming known.\r\n\r\nWe shall, then, in the first _nine_ chapters of the History of\r\nOptics treat of the Formal Science, that is, the discovery of the\r\nlaws of phenomena. The classes of phenomena which will thus pass\r\nunder oar notice are numerous; namely, reflection, refraction,\r\nchromatic dispersion, achromatization, double refraction,\r\npolarization, dipolarization, the colors of thin plates, the colors\r\nof thick plates, and the fringes and bands which accompany shadows.\r\nAll these cases had been studied, and, in most of them, the laws had\r\nbeen in a great measure discovered, before the physical theory of\r\nthe subject gave to our knowledge a simpler and more solid form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{53}}\r\nFORMAL OPTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRIMARY INDUCTION OF OPTICS.--RAYS OF LIGHT AND LAWS OF REFLECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN speaking of the Ancient History of Physics, we have already\r\nnoticed that the optical philosophers of antiquity had satisfied\r\nthemselves that vision is performed in straight lines;--that they\r\nhad fixed their attention upon those straight lines, or _rays_, as\r\nthe proper object of the science;--they had ascertained that rays\r\nreflected from a bright surface make the _angle of reflection_ equal\r\nto the _angle of incidence_;--and they had drawn several\r\nconsequences from these principles.\r\n\r\nWe may add to the consequences already mentioned, the art of\r\n_perspective_, which is merely a corollary from the doctrine of\r\nrectilinear visual rays; for if we suppose objects to be referred by\r\nsuch rays to a plane interposed between them and the eye, all the\r\nrules of perspective follow directly. The ancients practised this\r\nart, as we see in the pictures which remain to us and we learn from\r\nVitruvius,[1\\9] that they also wrote upon it. Agatharchus, who had\r\nbeen instructed by Eschylus in the art of making decorations for the\r\ntheatre, was the first author on this subject, and Anaxagoras, who\r\nwas a pupil of Agatharchus, also wrote an _Actinographia_, or\r\ndoctrine of drawing by rays: but none of these treatises are come\r\ndown to us. The moderns re-invented the art in the flourishing times\r\nof the art of painting, that is, about the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; and, belonging to that period also, we have treatises[2\\9]\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\9: _De Arch._ ix. Mont. i. 707.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\9: Gauricus, 1504.]\r\n\r\nBut these are only deductive applications of the most elementary\r\noptical doctrines; we must proceed to the inductions by which\r\nfurther discoveries were made. {54}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF REFRACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen in the former part of this history that the Greeks had\r\nformed a tolerably clear conception of the refraction as well as the\r\nreflection of the rays of light; and that Ptolemy had measured the\r\namount of refraction of glass and water at various angles. If we\r\ngive the names of the _angle of incidence_ and the _angle of\r\nrefraction_ respectively to the angles which a ray of light makes\r\nwith the line perpendicular to surface of glass or water (or any\r\nother medium) within and without the medium, Ptolemy had observed\r\nthat the angle of refraction is always less than the angle of\r\nincidence. He had supposed it to be less in a given proportion, but\r\nthis opinion is false; and was afterwards rightly denied by the\r\nArabian mathematician Alhazen. The optical views which occur in the\r\nwork of Alhazen are far sounder than those of his predecessors; and\r\nthe book may be regarded as the most considerable monument which we\r\nhave of the scientific genius of the Arabians; for it appears, for\r\nthe most part, not to be borrowed from Greek authorities. The author\r\nnot only asserts (lib. vii.), that refraction takes place towards\r\nthe perpendicular, and refers to experiment for the truth of this:\r\nand that the quantities of the refraction differ according to the\r\nmagnitudes of the angles which the directions of the incidental rays\r\n(_primæ lineæ_) make with the perpendiculars to the surface; but he\r\nalso says distinctly and decidedly that the angles of refraction do\r\nnot follow the proportion of the angles of incidence.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [There appears to be good ground to assent to the\r\nassertion of Alhazen's originality, made by his editor Risner, who\r\nsays, \"Euclideum hic vel Ptolemaicum nihil fere est.\" Besides the\r\ndoctrine of reflection and refraction of light, the Arabian author\r\ngives a description of the eye. He distinguishes three fluids,\r\n_humor aqueus_, _crystallinus_, _vitreus_, and four coats of the\r\neye, _tunica adherens_, _cornea_, _uvea_, _tunica reti similis_. He\r\ndistinguishes also three kinds of vision: \"Visibile percipitur aut\r\nsolo visu, aut visu et syllogismo, aut visu et anticipatâ notione.\"\r\nHe has several propositions relating to what we sometimes call the\r\nPhilosophy of Vision: for instance this: \"E visibili sæpius viso\r\nremanet in anima generalis notio,\" &c.] {55}\r\n\r\nThe assertion, that the angles of refraction are not proportional to\r\nthe angles of incidence, was an important remark; and if it had been\r\nsteadily kept in mind, the next thing to be done with regard to\r\nrefraction was to go on experimenting and conjecturing till the true\r\nlaw of refraction was discovered; and in the mean time to apply the\r\nprinciple as far as it was known. Alhazen, though he gives\r\ndirections for making experimental measures of refraction, does not\r\ngive any Table of the results of such experiments, as Ptolemy had\r\ndone. Vitello, a Pole, who in the 13th century published an\r\nextensive work upon Optics, does give such a table; and asserts it\r\nto be deduced from experiment, as I have already said (vol. i.). But\r\nthis assertion is still liable to doubt in consequence of the table\r\ncontaining impossible observations.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [As I have already stated, Vitello asserts that his Tables\r\nwere derived from his own observations. Their near agreement with\r\nthose of Ptolemy does not make this improbable: for where the\r\nobservations were only made to half a degree, there was not much\r\nroom for observers to differ. It is not unlikely that the\r\nobservations of refraction out of air into water and glass, and out\r\nof water into glass, were actually made; while the impossible values\r\nwhich accompany them, of the refraction out of water and glass into\r\nair, and out of glass into water, were calculated, and calculated\r\nfrom an erroneous rule.]\r\n\r\nThe principle that a ray refracted in glass or water is turned\r\ntowards the perpendicular, without knowing the exact law of\r\nrefraction, enabled mathematicians to trace the effects of\r\ntransparent bodies in various cases. Thus in Roger Bacon's works we\r\nfind a tolerably distinct explanation of the effect of a convex\r\nglass; and in the work of Vitello the effect of refraction at the\r\ntwo surfaces of a glass globe is clearly traceable.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Alhazen's assertion of the contrary, the opinion was\r\nstill current among mathematicians that the angle of refraction was\r\nproportional to the angle of incidence. But when Kepler's attention\r\nwas drawn to the subject, he saw that this was plainly inconsistent\r\nwith the observations of Vitello for large angles; and he convinced\r\nhimself by his own experiments that the true law was something\r\ndifferent from the one commonly supposed. The discovery of this true\r\nlaw excited in him an eager curiosity; and this point had the more\r\ninterest for him in consequence of the introduction of a correction\r\nfor atmospheric refraction into astronomical calculations, which had\r\nbeen made by Tycho, and of the invention of the telescope. In {56}\r\nhis _Supplement to Vitello_, published in 1604, Kepler attempts to\r\nreduce to a rule the measured quantities of refraction. The reader\r\nwho recollects what we have already narrated, the manner in which\r\nKepler attempted to reduce to law the astronomical observations of\r\nTycho,--devising an almost endless variety of possible formulæ,\r\ntracing their consequences with undaunted industry, and relating,\r\nwith a vivacious garrulity, his disappointments and his hopes,--will\r\nnot be surprised to find that he proceeded in the same manner with\r\nregard to the Tables of Observed Refractions. He tried a variety of\r\nconstructions by triangles, conic sections, &c., without being able\r\nto satisfy himself; and he at last[3\\9] is obliged to content\r\nhimself with an approximate rule, which makes the refraction partly\r\nproportional to the angle of incidence, and partly, to the secant of\r\nthat angle. In this way he satisfies the observed refractions within\r\na difference of less than half a degree each way. When we consider\r\nhow simple the law of refraction is, (that the ratio of the sines of\r\nthe angles of incidence and refraction is constant for the same\r\nmedium,) it appears strange that a person attempting to discover it,\r\nand drawing triangles for the purpose, should fail; but this lot of\r\nmissing what afterwards seems to have been obvious, is a common one\r\nin the pursuit of truth.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\9: L. U. K. _Life of Kepler_, p. 115.]\r\n\r\nThe person who did discover the Law of the Sines, was Willebrord\r\nSnell, about 1621; but the law was first published by Descartes, who\r\nhad seen Snell's papers.[4\\9] Descartes does not acknowledge this\r\nlaw to have been first detected by another; and after his manner,\r\ninstead of establishing its reality by reference to experiment, he\r\npretends to prove _à priori_ that it must be true,[5\\9] comparing,\r\nfor this purpose, the particles of light to balls striking a\r\nsubstance which _accelerates_ them.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\9: Huyghens, _Dioptrica_, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\9: _Diopt._ p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Huyghens says of Snell's papers, \"Quæ et nos vidimus\r\naliquando, et Cartesium quoque vidisse accepimus, et hinc fortasse\r\nmensuram illam quæ in sinibus consistit elicuerit.\" Isaac Vossius,\r\n_De Lucis Naturâ et Proprietate_, says that he also had seen this\r\nlaw in Snell's unpublished optical Treatise. The same writer says,\r\n\"Quod itaque (Cartesius) habet, refractionum momenta non exigenda\r\nesse ad angulos sed ad lineas, id tuo Snellio, acceptum ferre\r\ndebuisset, cujus nomen _more solito_ dissimulavit.\" \"Cartesius got\r\nhis law from Snell, and _in his usual way_, concealed it.\" {57}\r\n\r\nHuyghens' assertion, that Snell did not _attend to_ the proportion\r\nof the sines, is very captious; and becomes absurdly so, when it is\r\nmade to mean that Snell did not _know_ the law of the sines. It is\r\nnot denied that Snell knew the true law, or that the true law is the\r\nlaw of the sines. Snell does not use the trigonometrical term\r\n_sine_, but he expresses the law in a geometrical form more simply.\r\nEven if he _had_ attended to the law of the sines, he might\r\nreasonably have preferred his own way of stating it.\r\n\r\nJames Gregory also independently discovered the true law of\r\nrefraction; and, in publishing it, states that he had learnt that it\r\nhad already been published by Descartes.]\r\n\r\nBut though Descartes does not, in this instance, produce any good\r\nclaims to the character of an inductive philosopher, he showed\r\nconsiderable skill in tracing the consequences of the principle when\r\nonce adopted. In particular we must consider him as the genuine\r\nauthor of the explanation of the rainbow. It is true that\r\nFleischer[6\\9] and Kepler had previously ascribed this phenomenon to\r\nthe rays of sunlight which, falling on drops of rain, are refracted\r\ninto each drop, reflected at its inner surface, and refracted out\r\nagain: Antonio de Dominis had found that a glass globe of water,\r\nwhen placed in a particular position with respect to the eye,\r\nexhibited bright colors; and had hence explained the circular form\r\nof the bow, which, indeed, Aristotle had done before.[7\\9] But none\r\nof these writers had shown why there was a narrow bright circle of a\r\ndefinite diameter; for the drops which send rays to the eye after\r\ntwo refractions and a reflection, occupy a much wider space in the\r\nheavens. Descartes assigned the reason for this in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner,[8\\9] by showing that the rays which, after two\r\nrefractions and a reflection, come to the eye at an angle of about\r\nforty-one degrees with their original direction, are far more dense\r\nthan those in any other position. He showed, in the same manner,\r\nthat the existence and position of the _secondary bow_ resulted from\r\nthe same laws. This is the complete and adequate account of the\r\nstate of things, so far as the brightness of the bows only is\r\nconcerned; the explanation of the colors belongs to the next article\r\nof our survey.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\9: Mont. i. 701.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\9: _Meteorol._ iii. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\9: _Meteorum_, cap. viii. p. 196.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the rainbow and of its magnitude, afforded by\r\nSnell's law of sines, was perhaps one of the leading points in the\r\nverification of the law. The principle, being once established, was\r\napplied, by the aid of mathematical reasoning, to atmospheric\r\nrefractions, {58} optical instruments, _diacaustic_ curves, (that\r\nis, the curves of intense light produced by refraction,) and to\r\nvarious other cases; and was, of course, tested and confirmed by\r\nsuch applications. It was, however, impossible to pursue these\r\napplications far, without a due knowledge of the laws by which, in\r\nsuch cases, colors are produced. To these we now proceed.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I have omitted many interesting parts of the history of\r\nOptics about this period, because I was concerned with the\r\n_inductive_ discovery of laws, rather than with mathematical\r\n_deductions_ from such laws when established, or _applications_ of\r\nthem in the form of instruments. I might otherwise have noticed the\r\ndiscovery of Spectacle Glasses, of the Telescope, of the Microscope,\r\nof the Camera Obscura, and the mathematical explanation of these and\r\nother phenomena, as given by Kepler and others. I might also have\r\nnoticed the progress of knowledge respecting the Eye and Vision. We\r\nhave seen that Alhazen described the structure of the eye. The\r\noperation of the parts was gradually made out. Baptista Porta\r\ncompares the eye to his _Camera Obscura_ (_Magia Naturalis_, 1579).\r\nScheiner, in his _Oculus_, published 1652, completed the Theory of\r\nthe Eye. And Kepler discussed some of the questions even now often\r\nagitated; as the causes and conditions of our seeing objects single\r\nwith two eyes, and erect with inverted images.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF DISPERSION BY REFRACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY attempts were made to account for the colors of the rainbow,\r\nand various other phenomena in which colors are seen to arise from\r\ntransient and unsubstantial combinations of media. Thus Aristotle\r\nexplains the colors of the rainbow by supposing[9\\9] that it is\r\nlight seen through a dark medium: \"Now,\" says he, \"the bright seen\r\nthrough the dark appears red, as, for instance, the fire of green\r\nwood seen through the smoke, and the sun through mist. Also[10\\9]\r\nthe weaker is the light, or the visual power, and the nearer the\r\ncolor approaches to the black; becoming first red, then green, then\r\npurple. But[11\\9] the {59} vision is strongest in the outer circle,\r\nbecause the periphery is greater;--thus we shall have a gradation\r\nfrom red, through green, to purple, in passing from the outer to the\r\ninner circle.\" This account would hardly have deserved much notice,\r\nif it had not been for a strange attempt to revive it, or something\r\nvery like it, in modern times. The same doctrine is found in the\r\nwork of De Dominis.[12\\9] According to him, light is white: but if\r\nwe mix with the light something dark, the colors arise,--first red,\r\nthen green, then blue or violet. He applies this to explain the\r\ncolors of the rainbow,[13\\9] by means of the consideration that, of\r\nthe rays which come to the eye from the globes of water, some go\r\nthrough a larger thickness of the globe than others, whence he\r\nobtains the gradation of colors just described.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\9: _Meteor._ iii. 3, p. 373.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\9: Ib. p. 374.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\9: Ib. p. 375.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\9: Cap. iii. p. 9. See also Göthe, _Farbenl._ vol. ii.\r\np. 251.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\9: Göthe, p. 263.]\r\n\r\nDescartes came far nearer the true philosophy of the iridal colors.\r\nHe found that a similar series of colors was produced by refraction\r\nof light bounded by shade, through a prism;[14\\9] and he rightly\r\ninferred that neither the curvature of the surface of the drops of\r\nwater, nor the reflection, nor the repetition of refraction, were\r\nnecessary to the generation of such colors. In further examining the\r\ncourse of the rays, he approaches very near to the true conception\r\nof the case; and we are led to believe that he might have\r\nanticipated Newton in his discovery of the unequal refrangibility of\r\ndifferent colors, if it had been possible for him to reason any\r\notherwise than in the terms and notions of his preconceived\r\nhypotheses. The conclusion which he draws is,[15\\9] that \"the\r\nparticles of the subtile matter which transmit the action of light,\r\nendeavor to rotate with so great a force and impetus, that they\r\ncannot move in a straight line (whence comes refraction): and that\r\nthose particles which endeavor to revolve much more strongly produce\r\na red color, those which endeavor to move only a little more\r\nstrongly produce yellow.\" Here we have a clear perception that\r\ncolors and unequal refraction are connected, though the cause of\r\nrefraction is expressed by a gratuitous hypothesis. And we may add,\r\nthat he applies this notion rightly, so far as he explains\r\nhimself,[16\\9] to account for the colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\9: _Meteor._ Sect. viii. p. 190.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\9: Sect. vii. p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\9: _Meteor._ Sect. ix.]\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that Newton and others have done Descartes\r\ninjustice, in ascribing to De Dominis the true theory of the\r\nrainbow. There are two main points of this theory, namely, the\r\nshowing that a _bright_ circular band, of a certain definite\r\ndiameter, arises from the {60} great intensity of the light returned\r\nat a certain angle; and the referring the different _colors_ to the\r\n_different quantity of the refraction_; and both these steps appear\r\nindubitably to be the discoveries of Descartes. And he informs us\r\nthat these discoveries were not made without some exertion of\r\nthought. \"At first,\" he says,[17\\9] \"I doubted whether the iridal\r\ncolors were produced in the same way as those in the prism; but, at\r\nlast, taking my pen, and carefully calculating the course of the\r\nrays which fell on each part of the drop, I found that many more\r\ncome at an angle of forty-one degrees, than either at a greater or a\r\nless angle. So that there is a bright bow terminated by a shade; and\r\nhence the colors are the same as those produced through a prism.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\9: Sect. ix. p. 193.]\r\n\r\nThe subject was left nearly in the same state, in the work of\r\nGrimaldi, _Physico-Mathesis, de Lumine, Coloribus et Iride_,\r\npublished at Bologna in 1665. There is in this work a constant\r\nreference to numerous experiments, and a systematic exposition of\r\nthe science in an improved state. The author's calculations\r\nconcerning the rainbow are put in the same form as those of\r\nDescartes; but he is further from seizing the true principle on\r\nwhich its coloration depends. He rightly groups together a number of\r\nexperiments in which colors arise from refraction;[18\\9] and\r\nexplains them by saying that the color is brighter where the light\r\nis denser: and the light is denser on the side from which the\r\nrefraction turns the ray, because the increments of refraction are\r\ngreater in the rays that are more inclined.[19\\9] This way of\r\ntreating the question might be made to give a sort of explanation of\r\nmost of the facts, but is much more erroneous than a developement of\r\nDescartes's view would have been.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\9: Prop. 35, p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\9: Ib. p. 256.]\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1672, Newton gave[20\\9] the true explanation of the\r\nfacts; namely, that light consists of rays of different colors and\r\ndifferent refrangibility. This now appears to us so obvious a mode\r\nof interpreting the phenomena, that we can hardly understand how\r\nthey can be conceived in any other manner; but yet the impression\r\nwhich this discovery made, both upon Newton and upon his\r\ncontemporaries, shows how remote it was from the then accepted\r\nopinions. There appears to have been a general persuasion that the\r\ncoloration was produced, not by any peculiarity in the law of\r\nrefraction itself but by some collateral circumstance,--some\r\ndispersion or variation of density of the light, in addition to the\r\nrefraction. Newton's discovery consisted in {61} teaching distinctly\r\nthat the law of refraction was to be applied, not to the beam of\r\nlight in general, but to the colors in particular.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\9: _Phil. Trans._ t. vii. p. 3075.]\r\n\r\nWhen Newton produced a bright spot on the wall of his chamber, by\r\nadmitting the sun's light through a small hole in his\r\nwindow-shutter, and making it pass through a prism, he expected the\r\nimage to be round; which, of course, it would have been, if the\r\ncolors had been produced by an equal dispersion in all directions;\r\nbut to his surprise he saw the image, or _spectrum_, five times as\r\nlong as it was broad. He found that no consideration of the\r\ndifferent thickness of the glass, the possible unevenness of its\r\nsurface, or the different angles of rays proceeding from the two\r\nsides of the sun, could be the cause of this shape. He found, also,\r\nthat the rays did not go from the prism to the image in curves; he\r\nwas then convinced that the different colors were refracted\r\nseparately, and at different angles; and he confirmed this opinion\r\nby transmitting and refracting the rays of each color separately.\r\n\r\nThe experiments are so easy and common, and Newton's interpretation\r\nof them so simple and evident, that we might have expected it to\r\nreceive general assent; indeed, as we have shown, Descartes had\r\nalready been led very near the same point. In fact, Newton's\r\nopinions were not long in obtaining general acceptance; but they met\r\nwith enough of cavil and misapprehension to annoy extremely the\r\ndiscoverer, whose clear views and quiet temper made him impatient\r\nalike of stupidity and of contentiousness.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell long on the early objections which were made to\r\nNewton's doctrine. A Jesuit, of the name of Ignatius Pardies,\r\nprofessor at Clermont, at first attempted to account for the\r\nelongation of the image by the difference of the angles made by the\r\nrays from the two edges of the sun, which would produce a difference\r\nin the amount of refraction of the two borders; but when Newton\r\npointed out the calculations which showed the insufficiency of this\r\nexplanation, he withdrew his opposition. Another more pertinacious\r\nopponent appeared in Francis Linus, a physician of Liege; who\r\nmaintained, that having tried the experiment, he found the sun's\r\nimage, when the sky was clear, to be round and not oblong; and he\r\nascribed the elongation noticed by Newton, to the effect of clouds.\r\nNewton for some time refused to reply to this contradiction of his\r\nassertions, though obstinately persisted in; and his answer was at\r\nlast sent, just about the time of Linus's death, in 1675. But\r\nGascoigne, a friend of Linus, still maintained that he and others\r\nhad seen what the Dutch physician had described; and Newton, who was\r\npleased with the candor of {62} Gascoigne's letter, suggested that\r\nthe Dutch experimenters might have taken one of the images reflected\r\nfrom the surfaces of the prism, of which there are several, instead\r\nof the proper refracted one. By the aid of this hint, Lucas of Liege\r\nrepeated Newton's experiments, and obtained Newton's result, except\r\nthat he never could obtain a spectrum whose length was more than\r\nthree and a half times its breadth. Newton, on his side, persisted\r\nin asserting that the image would be five times as long as it was\r\nbroad, if the experiment were properly made. It is curious that he\r\nshould have been so confident of this, as to conceive himself\r\ncertain that such would be the result in all cases. We now know that\r\nthe dispersion, and consequently the length, of the spectrum, is\r\nvery different for different kinds of glass, and it is very probable\r\nthat the Dutch prism was really less dispersive than the English\r\none.[21\\9] The erroneous assumption which Newton made in this\r\ninstance, he held by to the last; and was thus prevented from making\r\nthe discovery of which we have next to speak.\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\9: Brewster's _Newton_, p. 50.]\r\n\r\nNewton was attacked by persons of more importance than those we have\r\nyet mentioned; namely, Hooke and Huyghens. These philosophers,\r\nhowever, did not object so much to the laws of refraction of\r\ndifferent colors, as to some expressions used by Newton, which, they\r\nconceived, conveyed false notions respecting the composition and\r\nnature of light. Newton had asserted that all the different colors\r\nare of distinct kinds, and that, by their composition, they form\r\nwhite light. This is true of colors as far as their analysis and\r\ncomposition by refraction are concerned; but Hooke maintained that\r\nall natural colors are produced by various combinations of two\r\nprimary ones, red and violet;[22\\9] and Huyghens held a similar\r\ndoctrine, taking, however, yellow and blue for his basis. Newton\r\nanswers, that such compositions as they speak of are not\r\ncompositions of simple colors in his sense of the expressions. These\r\nwriters also had both of them adopted an opinion that light\r\nconsisted in vibrations; and objected to Newton that his language\r\nwas erroneous, as involving the hypothesis that light was a body.\r\nNewton appears to have had a horror of the word _hypothesis_, and\r\nprotests against its being supposed that his \"theory\" rests on such\r\na foundation.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\9: Brewster's _Newton_, p. 54. _Phil. Trans._ viii. 5084,\r\n6086.]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the unequal refrangibility of different rays is\r\nclearly exemplified in the effects of lenses, which produce images\r\nmore or {63} less bordered with color, in consequence of this\r\nproperty. The improvement of telescopes was, in Newton's time, the\r\ngreat practical motive for aiming at the improvement of theoretical\r\noptics. Newton's theory showed why telescopes were imperfect,\r\nnamely, in consequence of the different refraction of different\r\ncolors, which produces a _chromatic_ aberration: and the theory was\r\nconfirmed by the circumstances of such imperfections. The false\r\nopinion of which we have already spoken, that the dispersion must be\r\nthe same when the refraction is the same, led him to believe that\r\nthe imperfection was insurmountable,--that _achromatic_ refraction\r\ncould not be obtained: and this view made him turn his attention to\r\nthe construction of reflecting instead of refracting telescopes. But\r\nthe rectification of Newton's error was a further confirmation of\r\nthe general truth of his principles in other respects; and since\r\nthat time, the soundness of the Newtonian law of refraction has\r\nhardly been questioned among physical philosophers.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, in modern times, been very vehemently controverted in\r\na quarter from which we might not readily have expected a detailed\r\ndiscussion on such a subject. The celebrated Göthe has written a work\r\non _The Doctrine of Colors_, (_Farbenlehre_; Tübingen, 1810,) one main\r\npurpose of which is, to represent Newton's opinions, and the work in\r\nwhich they are formally published, (his _Opticks_,) as utterly false\r\nand mistaken, and capable of being assented to only by the most blind\r\nand obstinate prejudice. Those who are acquainted with the extent to\r\nwhich such an opinion, promulgated by Göthe, was likely to be widely\r\nadopted in Germany, will not be surprised that similar language is\r\nused by other writers of that nation. Thus Schelling[23\\9] says:\r\n\"Newton's _Opticks_ is the greatest proof of the possibility of a\r\nwhole structure of fallacies, which, in all its parts, is founded upon\r\nobservation and experiment.\" Göthe, however, does not concede even so\r\nmuch to Newton's work. He goes over a large portion of it, page by\r\npage, quarrelling with the experiments, diagrams, reasoning, and\r\nlanguage, without intermission; and holds that it is not reconcileable\r\nwith the most simple facts. He declares,[24\\9] that the first time he\r\nlooked through a prism, he saw the white walls of the room still look\r\nwhite, \"and though alone, I pronounced, as by an instinct, that the\r\nNewtonian doctrine is false.\" We need not here point out how\r\ninconsistent with the Newtonian doctrine it was, to expect, as Göthe\r\nexpected, that the wall should be all over colored various colors.\r\n{64}\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\9: _Vorlesungen_, p. 270.]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\9: _Farbenlehre_, vol. ii. p. 678.]\r\n\r\nGöthe not only adopted and strenuously maintained the opinion that\r\nthe Newtonian theory was false, but he framed a system of his own to\r\nexplain the phenomena of color. As a matter of curiosity, it may be\r\nworth our while to state the nature of this system; although\r\nundoubtedly it forms no part of the _progress_ of physical science.\r\nGöthe's views are, in fact, little different from those of Aristotle\r\nand Antonio de Dominis, though more completely and systematically\r\ndeveloped. According to him, colors arise when we see through a dim\r\nmedium (\"ein trübes mittel\"). Light in itself is colorless; but if\r\nit be seen through a somewhat dim medium, it appears yellow; if the\r\ndimness of the medium increases, or if its depth be augmented, we\r\nsee the light gradually assume a yellow-red color, which finally is\r\nheightened to a ruby-red. On the other hand, if darkness is seen\r\nthrough a dim medium which is illuminated by a light falling on it,\r\na blue color is seen, which becomes clearer and paler, the more the\r\ndimness of the medium increases, and darker and fuller, as the\r\nmedium becomes more transparent; and when we come to \"the smallest\r\ndegree of the purest dimness,\" we see the most perfect violet.[25\\9]\r\nIn addition to this \"doctrine of the dim medium,\" we have a second\r\nprinciple asserted concerning refraction. In a vast variety of\r\ncases, images are accompanied by \"accessory images,\" as when we see\r\nbright objects in a looking-glass.[26\\9] Now, when an image is\r\ndisplaced by refraction, the displacement is not complete, clear and\r\nsharp, but incomplete, so that there is an accessory image along\r\nwith the principal one.[27\\9] From these principles, the colors\r\nproduced by refraction in the image of a bright object on a dark\r\nground, are at once derivable. The accessory image is\r\nsemitransparent;[28\\9] and hence that border of it which is pushed\r\nforwards, is drawn from the dark over the bright, and there the\r\nyellow appears; on the other hand, where the clear border laps over\r\nthe dark ground, the blue is seen;[29\\9] and hence we easily see\r\nthat the image must appear red and yellow at one end, and blue and\r\nviolet at the other.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\9: _Farbenlehre_, § 150, p. 151.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\9: Ib. § 223.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\9: Ib. § 227.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\9: Ib. § 238.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\9: Ib. § 239.]\r\n\r\nWe need not explain this system further, or attempt to show how\r\nvague and loose, as well as baseless, are the notions and modes of\r\nconception which it introduces. Perhaps it is not difficult to point\r\nout the peculiarities in Göthe's intellectual character which led to\r\nhis singularly unphilosophical views on this subject. One important\r\n{65} circumstance is, that he appears, like many persons in whom the\r\npoetical imagination is very active, to have been destitute of the\r\ntalent and the habit of geometrical thought. In all probability, he\r\nnever apprehended clearly and steadily those relations of position\r\non which the Newtonian doctrine depends. Another cause of his\r\ninability to accept the doctrine probably was, that he had conceived\r\nthe \"composition\" of colors in some way altogether different from\r\nthat which Newton understands by composition. What Göthe expected to\r\nsee, we cannot clearly collect; but we know, from his own statement,\r\nthat his intention of experimenting with a prism arose from his\r\nspeculations on the roles of coloring in pictures; and we can easily\r\nsee that any notion of the composition of colors which such\r\nresearches would suggest, would require to be laid aside, before he\r\ncould understand Newton's theory of the composition of light.\r\n\r\nOther objections to Newton's theory, of a kind very different, have\r\nbeen recently made by that eminent master of optical science, Sir\r\nDavid Brewster. He contests Newton's opinion, that the colored rays\r\ninto which light is separated by refraction are altogether simple\r\nand homogeneous, and incapable of being further analysed and\r\nmodified. For he finds that by passing such rays through colored\r\nmedia (as blue glass for instance), they are not only absorbed and\r\ntransmitted in very various degrees, but that some of them have\r\ntheir color altered; which effect he conceives as a further analysis\r\nof the rays, one component color being absorbed and the other\r\ntransmitted.[30\\9] And on this subject we can only say, as we have\r\nbefore said, that Newton has incontestably and completely\r\nestablished his doctrine, so far as analysis and decomposition _by\r\nrefraction_ are concerned; but that with regard to any other\r\nanalysis, which absorbing media or other agents may produce, we have\r\nno right from his experiments to assert, that the colors of the\r\nspectrum are incapable of _such_ decomposition. The whole subject of\r\nthe colors of objects, both opake and transparent, is still in\r\nobscurity. Newton's conjectures concerning the causes of the colors\r\nof natural bodies, appear to help us little; and his opinions on\r\nthat subject are to be separated altogether from the important step\r\nwhich he made in optical science, by the establishment of the true\r\ndoctrine of refractive dispersion.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\9: This latter fact has, however, been denied by other\r\nexperimenters.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [After a careful re-consideration of Sir D. Brewster's\r\nasserted analysis of the solar light into three colors by means of\r\n{66} absorbing media, I cannot consider that he has established his\r\npoint as an exception to Newton's doctrine. In the first place, the\r\nanalysis of light into _three_ colors appears to be quite arbitrary,\r\ngranting all his experimental facts. I do not see why, using other\r\nmedia, he might not just as well have obtained other elementary\r\ncolors. In the next place, this cannot be called an _analysis_ in\r\nthe same sense as Newton's analysis, except the relation between the\r\ntwo is shown. Is it meant that Newton's experiments prove nothing?\r\nOr is Newton's conclusion allowed to be true of light which has not\r\nbeen analysed by absorption? And where are we to find such light,\r\nsince the atmosphere absorbs? But, I must add, in the third place,\r\nthat with a very sincere admiration of Sir D. Brewster's skill as an\r\nexperimenter, I think his experiment requires, not only limitation,\r\nbut confirmation by other experimenters. Mr. Airy repeated the\r\nexperiments with about thirty different absorbing substances, and\r\ncould not satisfy himself that in any case they changed the color of\r\na ray of given refractive power. These experiments were described by\r\nhim at a meeting of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.]\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the corrections which the next generation\r\nintroduced into the details of this doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF ACHROMATISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE discovery that the laws of refractive dispersion of different\r\nsubstances were such as to allow of combinations which neutralised\r\nthe dispersion without neutralizing the refraction, is one which has\r\nhitherto been of more value to art than to science. The property has\r\nno definite bearing, which has yet been satisfactorily explained,\r\nupon the _theory_ of light; but it is of the greatest importance in\r\nits application to the construction of telescopes; and it excited\r\nthe more notice, in consequence of the prejudices and difficulties\r\nwhich for a time retarded the discovery.\r\n\r\nNewton conceived that he had proved by experiment,[31\\9] that light\r\n{67} is white after refraction, when the emergent rays are parallel\r\nto the incident, and in no other case. If this were so, the\r\nproduction of colorless images by refracting media would be\r\nimpossible; and such, in deference to Newton's great authority, was\r\nfor some time the general persuasion. Euler[32\\9] observed, that a\r\ncombination of lenses which does not color the image must be\r\npossible, since we have an example of such a combination in the\r\nhuman eye; and he investigated mathematically the conditions\r\nrequisite for such a result. Klingenstierna,[33\\9] a Swedish\r\nmathematician, also showed that Newton's rule could not be\r\nuniversally true. Finally, John Dollond,[34\\9] in 1757, repeated\r\nNewton's experiment, and obtained an opposite result. He found that\r\nwhen an object was seen through two prisms, one of glass and one of\r\nwater, of such angles that it did not appear displaced by\r\nrefraction, it was colored. Hence it followed that, without being\r\ncolored, the rays might be made to undergo refraction; and that\r\nthus, substituting lenses for prisms, a combination might be formed,\r\nwhich should produce an image without coloring it, and make the\r\nconstruction of an _achromatic_ telescope possible.\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\9: _Opticks_, B. i. p. ii. Prop. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\9: _Ac. Berlin._ 1747.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\9: _Swedish Trans._ 1754.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1758.]\r\n\r\nEuler at first hesitated to confide in Dollond's experiments; but he\r\nwas assured of their correctness by Clairaut, who had throughout\r\npaid great attention to the subject; and those two great\r\nmathematicians, as well as D'Alembert, proceeded to investigate\r\nmathematical formulæ which might be useful in the application of the\r\ndiscovery. The remainder of the deductions, which were founded upon\r\nthe laws of dispersion of various refractive substances, belongs\r\nrather to the history of art than of science. Dollond used at first,\r\nfor his achromatic object-glass, a lens of crown-glass, and one of\r\nflint-glass. He afterwards employed two lenses of the former\r\nsubstance, including between them one of the latter, adjusting the\r\ncurvatures of his lenses in such a way as to correct the\r\nimperfections arising from the spherical form of the glasses, as\r\nwell as the fault of color. Afterwards, Blair used fluid media along\r\nwith glass lenses, in order to produce improved object-glasses. This\r\nhas more recently been done in another form by Mr. Barlow. The\r\ninductive laws of refraction being established, their results have\r\nbeen deduced by various mathematicians, as Sir J. Herschel and\r\nProfessor Airy among ourselves, who have simplified and extended the\r\ninvestigation of the formulæ which determine the best combination of\r\nlenses in the object-glasses and eye-glasses of {68} telescopes,\r\nboth with reference to spherical and to _chromatic_ aberrations.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dollond's discovery, the colored spectra produced by\r\nprisms of two substances, as flint-glass and crown-glass, would be\r\nof the same length when the refraction was different. But a question\r\nthen occurred: When the whole distance from the red to the violet in\r\none spectrum was the same as the whole distance in the other, were\r\nthe intermediate colors, yellow, green, &c., in corresponding places\r\nin the two? This point also could not be determined any otherwise\r\nthan by experiment. It appeared that such a correspondence did not\r\nexist; and, therefore, when the extreme colors were corrected by\r\ncombinations of the different media, there still remained an\r\nuncorrected residue of color arising from the rest of the spectrum.\r\nThis defect was a consequence of the property, that the spectra\r\nbelonging to different media were not divided in the _same ratio_ by\r\nthe same colors, and was hence termed the _irrationality_ of the\r\nspectrum. By using three prisms, or three lenses, three colors may\r\nbe made to coincide instead of two, and the effects of this\r\nirrationality greatly diminished.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons already mentioned, we do not pursue this subject\r\nfurther,[35\\9] but turn to those optical facts which finally led to\r\na great and comprehensive theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\9: The discovery of the _fixed lines_ in the spectrum, by\r\nWollaston and Fraunhofer, has more recently supplied the means of\r\ndetermining, with extreme accuracy, the corresponding portions of\r\nthe spectrum in different refracting substances.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Mr. Chester More Hall, of More Hall, in Essex, is said to\r\nhave been led by the study of the human eye, which he conceived to\r\nbe achromatic, to construct achromatic telescopes as early as 1729.\r\nMr. Hall, however, kept his invention a secret. David Gregory, in\r\nhis _Catoptrics_ (1713), had suggested that it would perhaps be an\r\nimprovement of telescopes, if, in imitation of the human eye, the\r\nobject-glass were composed of different media. _Encyc. Brit._ art.\r\n_Optics_.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Clairaut first discovered the irrationality of the\r\ncolored spaces in the spectrum. In consequence of this\r\nirrationality, it follows that when two refracting media are so\r\ncombined as to correct each other's extreme dispersion, (the\r\nseparation of the red and violet rays,) this first step of\r\ncorrection still leaves a residue of {69} coloration arising from\r\nthe unequal dispersion of the intermediate rays (the green, &c.).\r\nThese _outstanding_ colors, as they were termed by Professor\r\nRobison, form the residual, or _secondary_ spectrum.\r\n\r\nDr. Blair, by very ingenious devices, succeeded in producing an\r\nobject-glass, corrected by a fluid lens, in which this aberration of\r\ncolor was completely corrected, and which performed wonderfully well.\r\n\r\nThe dispersion produced by a prism may be corrected by another prism\r\nof the _same substance_ and of a different angle. In this case also\r\nthere is an irrationality in the colored spaces, which prevents the\r\ncorrection of color from being complete; and hence, a new residuary\r\nspectrum, which has been called the _tertiary_ spectrum, by Sir\r\nDavid Brewster, who first noticed it.\r\n\r\nI have omitted, in the notice of discoveries respecting the\r\nspectrum, many remarkable trains of experimental research, and\r\nespecially the investigations respecting the power of various media\r\nto absorb the light of different parts of the spectrum, prosecuted\r\nby Sir David Brewster with extraordinary skill and sagacity. The\r\nobservations are referred to in chapter iii. Sir John Herschel,\r\nProf. Miller, Mr. Daniel, Dr. Faraday, and Mr. Talbot, have also\r\ncontributed to this part of our knowledge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF DOUBLE REFRACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE laws of refraction which we have hitherto described, were simple\r\nand uniform, and had a symmetrical reference to the surface of the\r\nrefracting medium. It appeared strange to men, when their attention\r\nwas drawn to a class of phenomena in which this symmetry was\r\nwanting, and in which a refraction took place which was not even in\r\nthe plane of incidence. The subject was not unworthy the notice and\r\nadmiration it attracted; for the prosecution of it ended in the\r\ndiscovery of the general laws of light. The phenomena of which I now\r\nspeak, are those exhibited by various kinds of crystalline bodies;\r\nbut observed for a long time in one kind only, namely, the\r\nrhombohedral calc-spar; or, as it was usually termed, from the\r\ncountry which supplied the largest and clearest crystals, _Iceland\r\nspar_. These {70} rhombohedral crystals are usually very smooth and\r\ntransparent, and often of considerable size; and it was observed, on\r\nlooking through them, that all objects appeared double. The\r\nphenomena, even as early as 1669, had been considered so curious,\r\nthat Erasmus Bartholin published a work upon them at\r\nCopenhagen,[36\\9] (_Experimenta Crystalli Islandici_, Hafniæ, 1669.)\r\nHe analysed the phenomena into their laws, so far as to discover\r\nthat one of the two images was produced by refraction after the\r\nusual rule, and the other by an unusual refraction. This latter\r\nrefraction Bartholin found to vary in different positions; to be\r\nregulated by a line parallel to the sides of the rhombohedron; and\r\nto be greatest in the direction of a line bisecting two of the\r\nangles of the rhombic face of the crystal.\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\9: Priestley's _Optics_, p. 550.]\r\n\r\nThese rules were exact as far as they went; and when we consider how\r\ngeometrically complex the law is, which really regulates the unusual\r\nor extraordinary refraction;--that Newton altogether mistook it, and\r\nthat it was not verified till the experiments of Haüy and Wollaston\r\nin our own time;--we might expect that it would not be soon or\r\neasily detected. But Huyghens possessed a key to the secret, in the\r\ntheory, which he had devised, of the propagation of light by\r\nundulations, and which he conceived with perfect distinctness and\r\ncorrectness, so far as its application to these phenomena is\r\nconcerned. Hence he was enabled to lay down the law of the phenomena\r\n(the only part of his discovery which we have here to consider),\r\nwith a precision and success which excited deserved admiration, when\r\nthe subject, at a much later period, regained its due share of\r\nattention. His Treatise was written[37\\9] in 1678, but not published\r\ntill 1690.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\9: See his _Traité de la Lumière_. Preface.]\r\n\r\nThe laws of the _ordinary_ and the _extraordinary_ refraction in\r\nIceland spar are related to each other; they are, in fact, similar\r\nconstructions, made, in the one case, by means of an imaginary\r\nsphere, in the other, by means of a spheroid; the spheroid being of\r\nsuch oblateness as to suit the rhombohedral form of the crystal, and\r\nthe axis of the spheroid being the axis of symmetry of the crystal.\r\nHuyghens followed this general conception into particular positions\r\nand conditions; and thus obtained rules, which he compared with\r\nobservation, for cutting the crystal and transmitting the rays in\r\nvarious manners. \"I have examined in detail,\" says he,[38] \"the\r\nproperties of the {71} extraordinary refraction of this crystal, to\r\nsee if each phenomenon which is deduced from theory, would agree\r\nwith what is really observed. And this being so, it is no slight\r\nproof of the truth of our suppositions and principles; but what I am\r\ngoing to add here confirms them still more wonderfully; that is, the\r\ndifferent modes of cutting this crystal, in which the surfaces\r\nproduced give rise to refractions exactly such as they ought to be,\r\nand as I had foreseen them, according to the preceding theory.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\9: See Maseres's _Tracts on Optics_, p. 250; or Huyghens,\r\n_Tr. sur la Lum._ ch. v. Art. 43.]\r\n\r\nStatements of this kind, coming from a philosopher like Huyghens,\r\nwere entitled to great confidence; Newton, however, appears not to\r\nhave noticed, or to have disregarded them. In his _Opticks_, he\r\ngives a rule for the extraordinary refraction of Iceland spar which\r\nis altogether erroneous, without assigning any reason for rejecting\r\nthe law published by Huyghens; and, so far as appears, without\r\nhaving made any experiments of his own. The Huyghenian doctrine of\r\ndouble refraction fell, along with his theory of undulations, into\r\ntemporary neglect, of which we shall have hereafter to speak. But in\r\n1788, Haüy showed that Huyghens's rule agreed much better than\r\nNewton's with the phenomena: and in 1802, Wollaston, applying a\r\nmethod of his own for measuring refraction, came to the same result.\r\n\"He made,\" says Young,[39\\9] \"a number of accurate experiments with\r\nan apparatus singularly well calculated to examine the phenomena,\r\nbut could find no general principle to connect them, until the work\r\nof Huyghens was pointed out to him.\" In 1808, the subject of double\r\nrefraction was proposed as a prize-question by the French Institute;\r\nand Malus, whose Memoir obtained the prize, says, \"I began by\r\nobserving and measuring a long series of phenomena on natural and\r\nartificial faces of Iceland spar. Then, testing by means of these\r\nobservations the different laws proposed up to the present time by\r\nphysical writers, I was struck with the admirable agreement of the\r\nlaw of Huyghens with the phenomena, and I was soon convinced that it\r\nis really the law of nature.\" Pursuing the consequences of the law,\r\nhe found that it satisfied phenomena which Huyghens himself had not\r\nobserved. From this time, then, the truth of the Huyghenian law was\r\nuniversally allowed, and soon afterwards, the theory by which it had\r\nbeen suggested was generally received.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\9: _Quart. Rev._ 1809, Nov. p. 338.]\r\n\r\nThe property of double refraction had been first studied only in\r\nIceland spar, in which it is very obvious. The same property\r\nbelongs, {72} though less conspicuously, to many other kinds of\r\ncrystals. Huyghens had noticed the same fact in rock-crystal;[40\\9]\r\nand Malus found it to belong to a large list of bodies besides; for\r\ninstance, arragonite, sulphate of lime, of baryta, of strontia, of\r\niron; carbonate of lead; zircon, corundum, cymophane, emerald,\r\neuclase, felspar, mesotype, peridote, sulphur, and mellite. Attempts\r\nwere made, with imperfect success, to reduce all these to the law\r\nwhich had been established for Iceland spar. In the first instance,\r\nMalus took for granted that the extraordinary refraction depended\r\nalways upon an oblate spheroid; but M. Biot[41\\9] pointed out a\r\ndistinction between two classes of crystals in which this spheroid\r\nwas oblong and oblate respectively, and these he called _attractive_\r\nand _repulsive_ crystals. With this correction, the law could be\r\nextended to a considerable number of cases; but it was afterwards\r\nproved by Sir D. Brewster's discoveries, that even in this form, it\r\nbelonged only to substances of which the crystallization has\r\nrelation to a single axis of symmetry, as the rhombohedron, or the\r\nsquare pyramid. In other cases, as the rhombic prism, in which the\r\nform, considered with reference to its crystalline symmetry, is\r\n_biaxal_, the law is much more complicated. In that case, the sphere\r\nand the spheroid, which are used in the construction for uniaxal\r\ncrystals, transform themselves into the two successful convolutions\r\nof a single continuous curve surface; neither of the two rays\r\nfollows the law of ordinary refraction; and the formula which\r\ndetermines their position is very complex. It is, however, capable\r\nof being tested by measures of the refractions of crystals cut in a\r\npeculiar manner for the purpose, and this was done by MM. Fresnel\r\nand Arago. But this complex law of double refraction was only\r\ndiscovered through the aid of the theory of a luminiferous ether,\r\nand therefore we must now return to the other facts which led to\r\nsuch a theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\9: _ Traité de la Lumière_, ch. v. Art. 20]\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\9: Biot, _Traité de Phys._ iii. 330.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF POLARIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF the Extraordinary Refraction of Iceland spar had appeared\r\nstrange, another phenomenon was soon noticed in the same {73}\r\nsubstance, which appeared stranger still, and which in the sequel\r\nwas found to be no less important. I speak of the facts which were\r\nafterwards described under the term _Polarization_. Huyghens was the\r\ndiscoverer of this class of facts. At the end of the treatise which\r\nwe have already quoted, he says,[42\\9] \"Before I quit the subject of\r\nthis crystal, I will add one other marvellous phenomenon, which I\r\nhave discovered since writing the above; for though hitherto I have\r\nnot been able to find out its cause, I will not, on that account,\r\nomit pointing it out, that I may give occasion to others to examine\r\nit.\" He then states the phenomena; which are, that when two\r\nrhombohedrons of Iceland spar are in parallel positions, a ray\r\ndoubly refracted by the first, is not further divided when it falls\r\non the second: the ordinarily refracted ray is ordinarily refracted\r\n_only_, and the extraordinary ray is only extraordinarily refracted\r\nby the second crystal, neither ray being doubly refracted. The same\r\nis still the case, if the two crystals have their _principal planes_\r\nparallel, though they themselves are not parallel. But if the\r\nprincipal plane of the second crystal be perpendicular to that of\r\nthe first, the reverse of what has been described takes place; the\r\nordinarily refracted ray of the first crystal suffers, at the\r\nsecond, extraordinary refraction _only_, and the extraordinary ray\r\nof the first suffers ordinary refraction only at the second. Thus,\r\nin each of these positions, the double refraction of each ray at the\r\nsecond crystal is reduced to single refraction, though in a\r\ndifferent manner in the two cases. But in any other position of the\r\ncrystals, each ray, produced by the first, is doubly refracted by\r\nthe second, so as to produce four rays.\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\9: _Tr. Opt._ p. 252.]\r\n\r\nA step in the right conception of these phenomena was made by\r\nNewton, in the second edition of his _Opticks_ (1717). He\r\nrepresented them as resulting from this;--that the rays of light\r\nhave \"sides,\" and that they undergo the ordinary or extraordinary\r\nrefraction, according as these sides are parallel to the principal\r\nplane of the crystal, or at right angles to it (Query 26). In this\r\nway, it is clear, that those rays which, in the first crystal, had\r\nbeen selected for extraordinary refraction, because their sides were\r\nperpendicular to the principal plane, would all suffer extraordinary\r\nrefraction at the second crystal for the same reason, if its\r\nprincipal plane were parallel to that of the first; and would all\r\nsuffer ordinary refraction, if the principal plane of the second\r\ncrystal were perpendicular to that of the first, and {74}\r\nconsequently parallel to the sides of the refracted ray. This view\r\nof the subject includes some of the leading features of the case,\r\nbut still leaves several considerable difficulties.\r\n\r\nNo material advance was made in the subject till it was taken up by\r\nMalus,[43\\9] along with the other circumstances of double refraction,\r\nabout a hundred years afterwards. He verified what had been observed\r\nby Huyghens and Newton, on the subject of the variations which light\r\nthus exhibits; but he discovered that this modification, in virtue of\r\nwhich light undergoes the ordinary, or the extraordinary, refraction,\r\naccording to the position of the plane of the crystal, may be\r\nimpressed upon it many other ways. One part of this discovery was made\r\naccidentally.[44\\9] In 1808, Malus happened to be observing the light\r\nof the setting sun, reflected from the windows of the Luxembourg,\r\nthrough a rhombohedron of Iceland spar; and he observed that in\r\nturning round the crystal, the two images varied in their intensity.\r\nNeither of the images completely vanished, because the light from the\r\nwindows was not properly modified, or, to use the term which Malus\r\nsoon adopted, was not completely _polarized_. The complete\r\npolarization of light by reflection from glass, or any other\r\ntransparent substance, was found to take place at a certain definite\r\nangle, different for each substance. It was found also that in all\r\ncrystals in which double refraction occurred, the separation of the\r\nrefracted rays was accompanied by polarization; the two rays, the\r\nordinary and the extraordinary, being always polarized _oppositely_,\r\nthat is, in planes at right angles to each other. The term _poles_,\r\nused by Malus, conveyed nearly the same notion as the term _sides_\r\nwhich had been employed by Newton, with the additional conception of a\r\nproperty which appeared or disappeared according as the _poles_ of the\r\nparticles were or were not in a certain direction; a property thus\r\nresembling the _polarity_ of magnetic bodies. When a spot of polarized\r\nlight is looked at through a transparent crystal of Iceland spar, each\r\nof the two images produced by the double refraction varies in\r\nbrightness as the crystal is turned round. If, for the sake of\r\nexample, we suppose the crystal to be turned round in the direction of\r\nthe points of the compass, N, E, S, W, and if one image be brightest\r\nwhen the crystal marks N and S, it will disappear when the crystal\r\nmarks E and W: and on the contrary, the second image will vanish when\r\nthe crystal marks N and S, {75} and will be brightest when the crystal\r\nmarks E and W. The first of these images is polarized _in the plane_\r\nNS passing through the ray, and the second _in the plane_ EW,\r\nperpendicular to the other. And these rays are _oppositely_ polarized.\r\nIt was further found that whether the ray were polarized by reflection\r\nfrom glass, or from water, or by double refraction, the modification\r\nof light so produced, or the nature of the polarization, was identical\r\nin all these cases;--that the alternatives of ordinary and\r\nextraordinary refraction and non-refraction, were the same, by\r\nwhatever crystal they were tested, or in whatever manner the\r\npolarization had been impressed upon the light; in short, that the\r\nproperty, when once acquired, was independent of everything except the\r\nsides or _poles_ of the ray; and thus, in 1811, the term\r\n\"polarization\" was introduced.[45\\9]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\9: Malus, _Th. de la Doub. Réf._ p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\9: Arago, art. _Polarization_, Supp. _Enc. Brit._]\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\9: _Mém. Inst._ 1810.]\r\n\r\nThis being the state of the subject, it became an obvious question,\r\nby what other means, and according to what laws, this property was\r\ncommunicated. It was found that some crystals, instead of giving, by\r\ndouble refraction, two images oppositely polarized, give a single\r\npolarized image. This property was discovered in the agate by Sir D.\r\nBrewster, and in tourmaline by M. Biot and Dr. Seebeck. The latter\r\nmineral became, in consequence, a very convenient part of the\r\napparatus used in such observations. Various peculiarities bearing\r\nupon this subject, were detected by different experimenters. It was\r\nin a short time discovered, that light might be polarized by\r\nrefraction, as well as by reflection, at the surface of\r\nuncrystallized bodies, as glass; the plane of polarization being\r\nperpendicular to the plane of refraction; further, that when a\r\nportion of a ray of light was polarized by reflection, a\r\ncorresponding portion was polarized by transmission, the planes of\r\nthe two polarizations being at right angles to each other. It was\r\nfound also that the polarization which was incomplete with a single\r\nplate, either by reflection or refraction, might be made more and\r\nmore complete by increasing the number of plates.\r\n\r\nAmong an accumulation of phenomena like this, it is our business to\r\ninquire what general laws were discovered. To make such discoveries\r\nwithout possessing the general theory of the facts, required no\r\nordinary sagacity and good fortune. Yet several laws were detected\r\nat this stage of the subject. Malus, in 1811, obtained the important\r\ngeneralization that, whenever we obtain, by any means, a polarized\r\nray of light, we produce also another ray, polarized in a contrary\r\n{76} direction; thus when reflection gives a polarized ray, the\r\ncompanion-ray is refracted polarized oppositely, along with a\r\nquantity of unpolarized light. And we must particularly notice _Sir\r\nD. Brewster's rule_ for the _polarizing angle_ of different bodies.\r\n\r\nMalus[46\\9] had said that the angle of reflection from transparent\r\nbodies which most completely polarizes the reflected ray, does not\r\nfollow any discoverable rule with regard to the order of refractive\r\nor dispersive powers of the substances. Yet the rule was in reality\r\nvery simple. In 1815, Sir D. Brewster stated[47\\9] as the law, which\r\nin all cases determines this angle, that \"the index of refraction is\r\nthe tangent of the angle of polarization.\" It follows from this,\r\nthat the polarization takes place when the reflected and refracted\r\nrays are at right angles to each other. This simple and elegant rule\r\nhas been fully confirmed by all subsequent observations, as by those\r\nof MM. Biot and Seebeck; and must be considered one of the happiest\r\nand most important discoveries of the laws of phenomena in Optics.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\9: _Mém. Inst._ 1810.]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1815.]\r\n\r\nThe rule for polarization by one reflection being thus discovered,\r\ntentative formulæ were proposed by Sir D. Brewster and M. Biot, for\r\nthe cases in which several reflections or refractions take place.\r\nFresnel also in 1817 and 1818, traced the effect of reflection in\r\nmodifying the direction of polarization, which Malus had done\r\ninaccurately in 1810. But the complexity of the subject made all\r\nsuch attempts extremely precarious, till the theory of the phenomena\r\nwas understood, a period which now comes under notice. The laws\r\nwhich we have spoken of were important materials for the\r\nestablishment of the theory; but in the mean time, its progress at\r\nfirst had been more forwarded by some other classes of facts, of a\r\ndifferent kind, and of a longer standing notoriety, to which we must\r\nnow turn our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF THE COLOURS OF THIN PLATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE facts which we have now to consider are remarkable, inasmuch as\r\nthe colours are produced merely by the smallness of dimensions of\r\nthe bodies employed. The light is not analysed by any peculiar {77}\r\nproperty of the substances, but dissected by the minuteness of their\r\nparts. On this account, these phenomena give very important\r\nindications of the real structure of light; and at an early period,\r\nsuggested views which are, in a great measure, just.\r\n\r\nHooke appears to be the first person who made any progress in\r\ndiscovering the laws of the colors of thin plates. In his\r\n_Micrographia_, printed by the Royal Society in 1664, he describes,\r\nin a detailed and systematic manner, several phenomena of this kind,\r\nwhich he calls \"fantastical colors.\" He examined them in _Muscovy\r\nglass_ or mica, a transparent mineral which is capable of being\r\nsplit into the exceedingly thin films which are requisite for such\r\ncolors; he noticed them also in the fissures of the same substance,\r\nin bubbles blown of water, rosin, gum, glass; in the films on the\r\nsurface of tempered steel; between two plane pieces of glass; and in\r\nother cases. He perceived also,[48\\9] that the production of each\r\ncolor required a plate of determinate thickness, and he employed\r\nthis circumstance as one of the grounds of his theory of light.\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\9: _Micrographia_, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nNewton took up the subject where Hooke had left it; and followed it\r\nout with his accustomed skill and clearness, in his _Discourse on\r\nLight and Colors_, communicated to the Royal Society in 1675. He\r\ndetermined, what Hooke had not ascertained, the thickness of the\r\nfilm which was requisite for the production of each color; and in\r\nthis way explained, in a complete and admirable manner, the colored\r\nrings which occur when two lenses are pressed together, and the\r\n_scale of color_ which the rings follow; a step of the more\r\nconsequence, as the same scale occurs in many other optical\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is not our business here to state the hypothesis with regard to\r\nthe properties of light which Newton founded on these facts;--the\r\n\"fits of easy transmission and reflection.\" We shall see hereafter\r\nthat his attempted induction was imperfect; and his endeavor to\r\naccount, by means of the laws of thin plates, for the colors of\r\nnatural bodies, is altogether unsatisfactory. But notwithstanding\r\nthese failures in the speculations on this subject, he did make in\r\nit some very important steps; for he clearly ascertained that when\r\nthe thickness of the plate was about 1⁄178000th of an inch, or three\r\ntimes, five times, seven times that magnitude, there was a bright\r\ncolor produced; but blackness, when the thickness was exactly\r\nintermediate between those magnitudes. He found, also, that the\r\nthicknesses which gave red and {78} violet[49\\9] were as fourteen to\r\nnine; and the intermediate colors of course corresponded to\r\nintermediate thicknesses, and therefore, in his apparatus,\r\nconsisting of two lenses pressed together, appeared as rings of\r\nintermediate sizes. His mode of confirming the rule, by throwing\r\nupon this apparatus differently colored homogeneous light, is\r\nstriking and elegant. \"It was very pleasant,\" he says, \"to see the\r\nrings gradually swell and contract as the color of the light was\r\nchanged.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\9: _Opticks_, p. 184.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to enter further into the detail of these\r\nphenomena, or to notice the rings seen by transmission, and other\r\ncircumstances. The important step made by Newton in this matter was,\r\nthe showing that the rays of light, in these experiments, as they\r\npass onwards go periodically through certain cycles of modification,\r\neach period occupying nearly the small fraction of an inch mentioned\r\nabove; and this interval being different for different colors.\r\nAlthough Newton did not correctly disentangle the conditions under\r\nwhich this periodical character is manifestly disclosed, the\r\ndiscovery that, under some circumstances, such a periodical\r\ncharacter does exist, was likely to influence, and did influence,\r\nmaterially and beneficially, the subsequent progress of Optics\r\ntowards a connected theory.\r\n\r\nWe must now trace this progress; but before we proceed to this task,\r\nwe will briefly notice a number of optical phenomena which had been\r\ncollected, and which waited for the touch of sound theory to\r\nintroduce among them that rule and order which mere observation had\r\nsought for in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS TO DISCOVER THE LAWS OF OTHER PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE phenomena which result from optical combinations, even of a\r\ncomparatively simple nature, are extremely complex. The theory which\r\nis now known accounts for these results with the most curious\r\nexactness, and points out the laws which pervade the apparent\r\nconfusion; but without this key to the appearances, it was scarcely\r\npossible that any rule or order should be detected. The undertaking\r\nwas of {79} the same kind as it would have been, to discover all the\r\ninequalities of the moon's motion without the aid of the doctrine of\r\ngravity. We will enumerate some of the phenomena which thus employed\r\nand perplexed the cultivators of optics.\r\n\r\nThe fringes of shadows were one of the most curious and noted of\r\nsuch classes of facts. These were first remarked by Grimaldi[50\\9]\r\n(1665), and referred by him to a property of light which he called\r\n_Diffraction_. When shadows are made in a dark room, by light\r\nadmitted through a very small hole, these appearances are very\r\nconspicuous and beautiful. Hooke, in 1672, communicated similar\r\nobservations to the Royal Society, as \"a new property of light not\r\nmentioned by any optical writer before;\" by which we see that he had\r\nnot heard of Grimaldi's experiments. Newton, in his _Opticks_,\r\ntreats of the same phenomena, which he ascribes to the _inflexion_\r\nof the rays of light. He asks (Qu. 3), \"Are not the rays of light,\r\nin passing by the edges and sides of bodies, bent several times\r\nbackward and forward with a motion like that of an eel? And do not\r\nthe three fringes of colored light in shadows arise from three such\r\nbendings?\" It is remarkable that Newton should not have noticed,\r\nthat it is impossible, in this way, to account for the facts, or\r\neven to express their laws; since the light which produces the\r\nfringes must, on this theory, be propagated, even after it leaves\r\nthe neighborhood of the opake body, in curves, and not in straight\r\nlines. Accordingly, all who have taken up Newton's notion of\r\ninflexion, have inevitably failed in giving anything like an\r\nintelligible and coherent character to these phenomena. This is, for\r\nexample, the case with Mr. (now Lord) Brougham's attempts in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1796. The same may be said of other\r\nexperimenters, as Mairan[51\\9] and Du Four,[52\\9] who attempted to\r\nexplain the facts by supposing an atmosphere about the opake body.\r\nSeveral authors, as Maraldi,[53\\9] and Comparetti,[54\\9] repeated or\r\nvaried these experiments in different ways.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\9: _Physico-Mathesis, de Lumine, Coloribus et Iride._\r\nBologna, 1665.]\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\9: _Ac. Par._ 1738.]\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\9: _Mémoires Présentés_, vol. v.]\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\9: _Ac. Par._ 1723.]\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\9: _Observationes Opticæ de Luce Inflexâ et Coloribus._\r\nPadua, 1787.]\r\n\r\nNewton had noticed certain rings of color produced by a glass\r\nspeculum, which he called \"colors of thick plates,\" and which he\r\nattempted to connect with the colors of thin plates. His reasoning\r\nis by no means satisfactory; but it was of use, by pointing out this\r\nas a case in which his \"fits\" (the small periods, or cycles in the\r\nrays of light, of {80} which we have spoken) continued to occur for\r\na considerable length of the ray. But other persons, attempting to\r\nrepeat his experiments, confounded with them extraneous phenomena of\r\nother kinds; as the Duc de Chaulnes, who spread muslin before his\r\nmirror,[55\\9] and Dr. Herschel, who scattered hair-powder before\r\nhis.[56\\9] The colors produced by the muslin were those belonging to\r\nshadows of _gratings_, afterwards examined more successfully by\r\nFraunhofer, when in possession of the theory. We may mention here\r\nalso the colors which appear on finely-striated surfaces, and on\r\nmother-of-pearl, feathers, and similar substances. These had been\r\nexamined by various persons (as Boyle, Mazeas, Lord Brougham), but\r\ncould still, at this period, be only looked upon as insulated and\r\nlawless facts.\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\9: _Ac. Par._ 1755.]\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1807.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF PHENOMENA OF DIPOLARIZED LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBESIDES the above-mentioned perplexing cases of colors produced by\r\ncommon light, cases of _periodical colors produced by polarized\r\nlight_ began to be discovered, and soon became numerous. In August,\r\n1811, M. Arago communicated to the Institute of France an account of\r\ncolors seen by passing polarized light through mica, and\r\n_analysing_[57\\9] it with a prism of Iceland spar. It is remarkable\r\nthat the light which produced the colors in this case was the light\r\npolarized by the sky, a cause of polarization not previously known.\r\nThe effect which the mica thus produced was termed\r\n_depolarization_;--not a very happy term, since the effect is not\r\nthe destruction of the polarization, but the combination of a new\r\npolarizing influence with the former. The word _dipolarization_,\r\nwhich has since been proposed, is a much more appropriate\r\nexpression. Several other curious phenomena of the same kind were\r\nobserved in quartz, and in flint-glass. M. Arago was not able to\r\nreduce these phenomena to laws, but he had a full conviction of\r\ntheir value, and ventures to class them with the great steps in {81}\r\nthis part of optics. \"To Bartholin we owe the knowledge of double\r\nrefraction; to Huyghens, that of the accompanying polarization; to\r\nMalus, polarization by reflection; to Arago, depolarization.\" Sir D.\r\nBrewster was at the same time engaged in a similar train of\r\nresearch; and made discoveries of the same nature, which, though not\r\npublished till some time after those of Arago, were obtained without\r\na knowledge of what had been done by him. Sir D. Brewster's\r\n_Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments_, published in 1813,\r\ncontains many curious experiments on the \"depolarizing\" properties\r\nof minerals. Both these observers noticed the changes of color which\r\nare produced by changes in the position of the ray, and the\r\nalternations of color in the two oppositely polarized images; and\r\nSir D. Brewster discovered that, in topaz, the phenomena had a\r\ncertain reference to lines which he called the _neutral_ and\r\n_depolarizing_ axes. M. Biot had endeavored to reduce the phenomena\r\nto a law; and had succeeded so far, that he found that in the plates\r\nof sulphate of lime, the place of the tint, estimated in Newton's\r\n_scale_ (see _ante_, chap. vii.), was as the square of the sine of\r\nthe inclination. But the laws of these phenomena became much more\r\nobvious when they were observed by Sir D. Brewster with a larger\r\nfield of view.[58\\9] He found that the colors of topaz, under the\r\ncircumstances now described, exhibited themselves in the form of\r\nelliptical rings, crossed by a black bar, \"the most brilliant class\r\nof phenomena,\" as he justly says, \"in the whole range of optics.\" In\r\n1814, also, Wollaston observed the circular rings with a black\r\ncross, produced by similar means in calc-spar; and M. Biot, in 1815,\r\nmade the same observation. The rings in several of these cases were\r\ncarefully measured by M. Biot and Sir D. Brewster, and a great mass\r\nof similar phenomena was discovered. These were added to by various\r\npersons, as M. Seebeck, and Sir John Herschel.\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\9: The prism of Iceland spar produces the colors by\r\nseparating the transmitted rays according to the laws of double\r\nrefraction. Hence it is said to _analyse_ the light.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1814.]\r\n\r\nSir D. Brewster, in 1818, discovered a general relation between the\r\ncrystalline form and the optical properties, which gave an\r\nincalculable impulse and a new clearness to these researches. He\r\nfound that there was a correspondence between the degree of symmetry\r\nof the optical phenomena and the crystalline form; those crystals\r\nwhich are uniaxal in the crystallographical sense, are also uniaxal\r\nin their optical properties, and give circular rings; those which\r\nare of other forms are, generally speaking, biaxal; they give oval\r\nand knotted _isochromatic_ lines, with two _poles_. He also\r\ndiscovered a rule for the tint at each point {82} in such cases; and\r\nthus explained, so far as an empirical law of phenomena went, the\r\ncurious and various forms of the colored curves. This law, when\r\nsimplified by M. Biot,[59\\9] made the tint proportional to the\r\nproduct of the distances of the point from the two poles. In the\r\nfollowing year, Sir J. Herschel confirmed this law by showing, from\r\nactual measurement, that the curve of the isochromatic lines in\r\nthese cases was the curve termed the _lemniscata_, which has, for\r\neach point, the product of the distances from two fixed poles equal\r\nto a constant quantity.[60\\9] He also reduced to rule some other\r\napparent anomalies in phenomena of the same class.\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\9: _Mém. Inst._ 1818, p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1819.]\r\n\r\nM. Biot, too, gave a rule for the directions of the planes of\r\npolarization of the two rays produced by double refraction in biaxal\r\ncrystals, a circumstance which has a close bearing upon the\r\nphenomena of dipolarization. His rule was, that the one plane of\r\npolarization bisects the dihedral angle formed by the two planes\r\nwhich pass through the optic axes, and that the other is\r\nperpendicular to such a plane. When, however, Fresnel had discovered\r\nfrom the theory the true laws of double refraction, it appeared that\r\nthe above rule is inaccurate, although in a degree which observation\r\ncould hardly detect without the aid of theory.[61\\9]\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\9:  Fresnel, _Mém. Inst._ 1827, p. 162.]\r\n\r\nThere were still other classes of optical phenomena which attracted\r\nnotice; especially those which are exhibited by plates of quartz cut\r\nperpendicular to the axis. M. Arago had observed, in 1811, that this\r\nsubstance produced a _twist_ of the plane of polarization to the right\r\nor left hand, the amount of this twist being different for different\r\ncolors; a result which was afterwards traced to a modification of\r\nlight different both from common and from polarized light, and\r\nsubsequently known as _circular polarization_. Sir J. Herschel had\r\nthe good fortune and sagacity to discover that this peculiar kind of\r\npolarization in quartz was connected with an equally peculiar\r\nmodification of crystallization, the _plagihedral_ faces which are\r\nseen, on some crystals, obliquely disposed, and, as it were,\r\nfollowing each other round the crystal from left to right, or from\r\nright to left. Sir J. Herschel found that the _right-handed_ or\r\n_left-handed_ character of the circular polarization corresponded,\r\nin all cases, to that of the crystal.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, M. Biot, in his researches on the subject of circular\r\npolarization, was led to the unexpected and curious discovery, that\r\nthis {83} property which seemed to require for its very conception a\r\ncrystalline structure in the body, belonged nevertheless to several\r\nfluids, and in different directions for different fluids. Oil of\r\nturpentine, and an essential oil of laurel, gave the plane of\r\npolarization a rotation to the left hand; oil of citron, syrup of\r\nsugar, and a solution of camphor, gave a rotation to the right hand.\r\nSoon after, the like discovery was made independently by Dr.\r\nSeebeck, of Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be supposed that all those brilliant phenomena could\r\nnot be observed, and the laws of many of the phenomena discovered,\r\nwithout attempts on the part of philosophers to combine them all\r\nunder the dominion of some wide and profound theory. Endeavors to\r\nascend from such knowledge as we have spoken of, to the general\r\ntheory of light, were, in fact, made at every stage of the subject,\r\nand with a success which at last won almost all suffrages. We are\r\nnow arrived at the point at which we are called upon to trace the\r\nhistory of this theory; to pass from the laws of phenomena to their\r\ncauses;--from Formal to Physical Optics. The undulatory theory of\r\nlight, the only discovery which can stand by the side of the theory\r\nof universal gravitation, as a doctrine belonging to the same order,\r\nfor its generality, its fertility, and its certainty, may properly\r\nbe treated of with that ceremony which we have hitherto bestowed\r\nonly on the great advances of astronomy; and I shall therefore now\r\nproceed to speak of the Prelude to this epoch, the Epoch itself, and\r\nits Sequel, according to the form of the preceding Book which treats\r\nof astronomy.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I ought to have stated, in the beginning of this chapter,\r\nthat Malus discovered the depolarization of _white light_ in 1811.\r\nHe found that a pencil of light which, being polarized, refused to\r\nbe reflected by a surface properly placed, recovered its power of\r\nbeing reflected after being transmitted through certain crystals and\r\nother transparent bodies. Malus intended to pursue this subject,\r\nwhen his researches were terminated by his death, Feb. 7, 1812. M.\r\nArago, about the same time, announced his important discovery of the\r\ndepolarization of _colors_ by crystals.\r\n\r\nI may add, to what is above said of M. Biot's discoveries respecting\r\nthe circular polarizing power of fluids, that he pursued his\r\nresearches so as to bring into view some most curious relations\r\namong the elements of bodies. It appeared that certain substances,\r\nas sugar of canes, had a right-handed effect, and certain other\r\nsubstances, as gum, a left-handed effect; and that the molecular\r\nvalue of this effect was not altered by dilution. It appeared also\r\nthat a certain element of the {84} substance of fruits, which had\r\nbeen supposed to be gum, and which is changed into sugar by the\r\noperation of acids, is not gum, and has a very energetic\r\nright-handed effect. This substance M. Biot called _dextrine_, and\r\nhe has since traced its effects into many highly curious and\r\nimportant results.**]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{85}}\r\nPHYSICAL OPTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE EPOCH OF YOUNG AND FRESNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY _Physical_ Optics we mean, as has already been stated, the\r\ntheories which explain optical phenomena on mechanical principles.\r\nNo such explanation could be given till true mechanical principles\r\nhad been obtained; and, accordingly, we must date the commencement\r\nof the essays towards physical optics from Descartes, the founder of\r\nthe modern mechanical philosophy. His hypothesis concerning light\r\nis, that it consists of small particles emitted by the luminous\r\nbody. He compares these particles to balls, and endeavors to\r\nexplain, by means of this comparison, the laws of reflection and\r\nrefraction.[62\\9] In order to account for the production of colors\r\nby refraction, he ascribes to these balls an alternating rotatory\r\nmotion.[63\\9] This form of the _emission theory_, was, like most of\r\nthe physical speculations of its author, hasty and gratuitous; but\r\nwas extensively accepted, like the rest of the Cartesian doctrines,\r\nin consequence of the love which men have for sweeping and simple\r\ndogmas, and deductive reasonings from them. In a short time,\r\nhowever, the rival optical _theory of undulations_ made its\r\nappearance. Hooke in his _Micrographia_ (1664) propounds it, upon\r\noccasion of his observations, already noticed, (chap. **vii.,) on the\r\ncolors of thin plates. He there asserts[64\\9] light to consist in a\r\n\"quick, short, vibrating motion,\" and that it is propagated in a\r\nhomogeneous medium, in such a way that \"every pulse or vibration of\r\nthe luminous body will generate a sphere, which will continually\r\nincrease and grow bigger, just after the same manner (though\r\nindefinitely swifter) as the waves or rings on the surface of water\r\ndo swell into bigger and bigger circles about a point in it.\"[65\\9]\r\nHe applies this to the explanation of refraction, {86} by supposing\r\nthat the rays in a denser medium move more easily, and hence that\r\nthe pulses become oblique; a far less satisfactory and consistent\r\nhypothesis than that of Huyghens, of which we shall next have to\r\nspeak. But Hooke has the merit of having also combined with his\r\ntheory, though somewhat obscurely, the _Principle of Interferences_,\r\nin the application which he makes of it to the colors of thin\r\nplates. Thus[66\\9] he supposes the light to be reflected at the\r\nfirst surface of such plates; and he adds, \"after two refractions\r\nand one reflection (from the second surface) there is propagated a\r\nkind of fainter ray,\" which comes behind the other reflected pulse;\r\n\"so that hereby (the surfaces AB and EF being so near together that\r\nthe eye cannot discriminate them from one), this compound or\r\nduplicated pulse does produce on the retina the sensation of a\r\nyellow.\" The reason for the production of this particular color, in\r\nthe case of which he here speaks, depends on his views concerning\r\nthe kind of pulses appropriate to each color; and, for the same\r\nreason, when the thickness is different, he finds that the result\r\nwill be a red or a green. This is a very remarkable anticipation of\r\nthe explanation ultimately given of these colors; and we may observe\r\nthat if Hooke could have measured the thickness of his thin plates,\r\nhe could hardly have avoided making considerable progress in the\r\ndoctrine of interferences.\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\9: _Diopt._ c. ii. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\9: _Meteor._ c. viii. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\9: _Micrographia_, p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\9: _Micrographia_, p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\9: _Micrographia_, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nBut the person who is generally, and with justice, looked upon as\r\nthe great author of the undulatory theory, at the period now under\r\nnotice, is Huyghens, whose _Traité de la Lumière_, containing a\r\ndevelopement of his theory, was written in 1678, though not\r\npublished till 1690. In this work he maintained, as Hooke had done,\r\nthat light consists in undulations, and expands itself spherically,\r\nnearly in the same manner as sound does; and he referred to the\r\nobservations of Römer on Jupiter's satellites, both to prove that\r\nthis difference takes place successively, and to show its exceeding\r\nswiftness. In order to trace the effect of an undulation, Huyghens\r\nconsiders that every point of a wave diffuses its motion in all\r\ndirections; and hence he draws the conclusion, so long looked upon\r\nas the turning-point of the combat between the rival theories, that\r\nthe light will not be _diffused_ beyond the rectilinear space, when\r\nit passes through an aperture; \"for,\" says he,[67\\9] \"although the\r\n_partial_ waves, produced by the particles comprised in the\r\naperture, do diffuse themselves beyond the rectilinear space, these\r\nwaves do not _concur_ anywhere except in front of the {87}\r\naperture.\" He rightly considers this observation as of the most\r\nessential value. \"This,\" he says, \"was not known by those who began\r\nto consider the waves of light, among whom are Mr. Hooke in his\r\n_Micrography_, and Father Pardies; who, in a treatise of which he\r\nshowed me a part, and which he did not live to finish, had\r\nundertaken to prove, by these waves, the effects of reflection and\r\nrefraction. But the principal foundation, which consists in the\r\nremark I have just made, was wanting in his demonstrations.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\9: _Tracts on Optics_, p. 209.]\r\n\r\nBy the help of this view, Huyghens gave a perfectly satisfactory and\r\ncorrect explanation of the laws of reflection and refraction; and he\r\nalso applied the same theory, as we have seen, to the double\r\nrefraction of Iceland spar with great sagacity and success. He\r\nconceived that in this crystal, besides the spherical waves, there\r\nmight be others of a spheroidal form, the axis of the spheroid being\r\nsymmetrically disposed with regard to the faces of the rhombohedron,\r\nfor to these faces the optical phenomena are symmetrically related.\r\nHe found[68\\9] that the position of the refracted ray, determined by\r\nsuch spheroidal undulations, would give an oblique refraction, which\r\nwould coincide in its laws with the refraction observed in Iceland\r\nspar; and, as we have stated, this coincidence was long after fully\r\nconfirmed by other observers.\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\9: _Tracts on Optics_, 237.]\r\n\r\nSince Huyghens, at this early period, expounded the undulatory\r\ntheory with so much distinctness, and applied it with so much skill,\r\nit may be asked why we do not hold him up as the great Author of the\r\ninduction of undulations of light;--the person who marks the epoch\r\nof the theory? To this we reply, that though Huyghens discovered\r\nstrong presumptions in favor of the undulatory theory, it was not\r\n_established_ till a later era, when the fringes of shadows, rightly\r\nunderstood, made the waves visible, and when the hypothesis which\r\nhad been assumed to account for double refraction, was found to\r\ncontain also an explanation of polarization. It is _then_ that this\r\ntheory of light assumes its commanding form; and the persons who\r\ngave it this form, we must make the great names of our narrative;\r\nwithout, however, denying the genius and merit of Huyghens, who is,\r\nundoubtedly, the leading character in the prelude to the discovery.\r\n\r\nThe undulatory theory, from this time to our own, was unfortunate in\r\nits career. It was by no means destitute of defenders, but these\r\nwere not experimenters; and none of them thought of applying it to\r\n{88} Grimaldi's experiments on fringes, of which we have spoken a\r\nlittle while ago. And the great authority of the period, Newton,\r\nadopted the opposite hypothesis, that of emission, and gave it a\r\ncurrency among his followers which kept down the sounder theory for\r\nabove a century.\r\n\r\nNewton's first disposition appears to have been by no means averse\r\nto the assumption of an ether as the vehicle of luminiferous\r\nundulations. When Hooke brought against his prismatic analysis of\r\nlight some objections, founded on his own hypothetical notions,\r\nNewton, in his reply, said,[69\\9] \"The hypothesis has a much greater\r\naffinity with his own hypothesis than he seems to be aware of; the\r\nvibrations of the ether being as useful and necessary in this as in\r\nhis.\" This was in 1672; and we might produce, from Newton's writing,\r\npassages of the same kind, of a much later date. Indeed it would\r\nseem that, to the last, Newton considered the assumption of an ether\r\nas highly probable, and its vibrations important parts of the\r\nphenomena of light; but he also introduced into his system the\r\nhypothesis of emission, and having followed this hypothesis into\r\nmathematical detail, while he has left all that concerns the ether\r\nin the form of queries and conjectures, the emission theory has\r\nnaturally been treated as the leading part of his optical doctrines.\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\9: _Phil. Trans._ vii. 5087.]\r\n\r\nThe principal propositions of the _Principia_ which bear upon the\r\nquestion of optical theory are those of the fourteenth Section of\r\nthe first Book,[70\\9] in which the law of the sines in refraction is\r\nproved on the hypothesis that the particles of bodies act on light\r\nonly at very small distances; and the proposition of the eighth\r\nSection of the second Book;[71\\9] in which it is pretended to be\r\ndemonstrated that the motion propagated in a fluid must diverge when\r\nit has passed through an aperture. The former proposition shows that\r\nthe law of refraction, an optical truth which mainly affected the\r\nchoice of a theory, (for about reflection there is no difficulty on\r\nany mechanical hypothesis,) follows from the theory of emission: the\r\nlatter proposition was intended to prove the inadmissibility of the\r\nrival hypothesis, that of undulations. As to the former point,--the\r\nhypothetical explanation of refraction, on the assumptions there\r\nmade,--the conclusion is quite satisfactory; but the reasoning in\r\nthe latter case, (respecting the propagation of undulations,) is\r\ncertainly inconclusive and vague; and something better might the\r\nmore reasonably have been expected, since Huyghens had at least {89}\r\nendeavored to prove the opposite proposition. But supposing we leave\r\nthese properties, the rectilinear course, the reflection, and the\r\nrefraction of light, as problems in which neither theory has a\r\ndecided advantage, what is the next material point? The colors of\r\nthin plates. Now, how does Newton's theory explain these? By a new\r\nand special supposition;--that of _fits of easy transmission and\r\nreflection_: a supposition which, though it truly expresses these\r\nfacts, is not borne out by any other phenomena. But, passing over\r\nthis, when we come to the peculiar laws of polarization in Iceland\r\nspar, how does Newton's meet this? Again by a special and new\r\nsupposition;--that the rays of light have _sides_. Thus we find no\r\nfresh evidence in favor of the emission hypothesis springing out of\r\nthe fresh demands made upon it. It may be urged, in reply, that the\r\nsame is true of the undulatory theory; and it must be allowed that,\r\nat the time of which we now speak, its superiority in this respect\r\nwas not manifested; though Hooke, as we have seen, had caught a\r\nglimpse of the explanation, which this theory supplies, of the\r\ncolors of thin plates.\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\9:  _Principia_, Prop. 94, _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\9: Ib. Prop. 42.]\r\n\r\nAt a later period, Newton certainly seems to have been strongly\r\ndisinclined to believe light to consist in undulations merely. \"Are\r\nnot,\" he says, in Question twenty-eight of the _Opticks_, \"all\r\nhypotheses erroneous, in which light is supposed to consist in\r\npression or motion propagated through a fluid medium?\" The arguments\r\nwhich most weighed with him to produce this conviction, appear to\r\nhave been the one already mentioned,--that, on the undulatory\r\nhypothesis, undulations passing through an aperture would be\r\ndiffused; and again,--his conviction, that the properties of light,\r\ndeveloped in various optical phenomena, \"depend not upon new\r\nmodifications, but upon the original and unchangeable properties of\r\nthe rays.\" (Question twenty-seven.)\r\n\r\nBut yet, even in this state of his views, he was very far from\r\nabandoning the machinery of vibrations altogether. He is disposed to\r\nuse such machinery to produce his \"fits of easy transmission.\" In\r\nhis seventeenth Query, he says,[72\\9] \"when a ray of light falls\r\nupon the surface of any pellucid body, and is there refracted or\r\nreflected; may not waves of vibrations or tremors be thereby excited\r\nin the refracting or reflecting medium at the point of incidence? .\r\n. . . and do not these vibrations overtake the rays of light, and by\r\novertaking them successively, do they not put them into the fits of\r\neasy reflection and easy {90} transmission described above?\" Several\r\nof the other queries imply the same persuasion, of the necessity for\r\nthe assumption of an ether and its vibrations. And it might have\r\nbeen asked, whether any good reason could be given for the\r\nhypothesis of an ether as a _part_ of the mechanism of light, which\r\nwould not be equally valid in favor of this being the _whole_ of the\r\nmechanism, especially if it could be shown that nothing more was\r\nwanted to produce the results.\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\9: _Opticks_, p. 322.]\r\n\r\nThe emission theory was, however, embraced in the most strenuous\r\nmanner by the disciples of Newton. That propositions existed in the\r\n_Principia_ which proceeded on this hypothesis, was, with many of\r\nthese persons, ground enough for adopting the doctrine; and it had\r\nalso the advantage of being more ready of conception, for though the\r\npropagation of a wave is not very difficult to conceive, at least by\r\na mathematician, the motion of a particle is still easier.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the undulation theory was maintained by no less a\r\nperson than Euler; and the war between the two opinions was carried\r\non with great earnestness. The arguments on one side and on the\r\nother soon became trite and familiar, for no person explained any\r\nnew class of facts by either theory. Thus it was urged by Euler\r\nagainst the system of emission,[73\\9]--that the perpetual emanation\r\nof light from the sun must have diminished the mass;--that the\r\nstream of matter thus constantly flowing must affect the motions of\r\nthe planets and comets; that the rays must disturb each other;--that\r\nthe passage of light through transparent bodies is, on this system,\r\ninconceivable: all such arguments were answered by representations\r\nof the exceeding minuteness and velocity of the matter of light. On\r\nthe other hand, there was urged against the theory of waves, the\r\nfavorite Newtonian argument, that on this theory the light passing\r\nthrough an aperture ought to be diffused, as sound is. It is curious\r\nthat Euler does not make to this argument the reply which Huyghens\r\nhad made before. The fact really was, that he was not aware of the\r\ntrue ground of the difference of the result in the cases of sound\r\nand light; namely, that any ordinary aperture bears an immense ratio\r\nto the length of an undulation of light, but does not bear a very\r\ngreat ratio to the length of an undulation of sound. The\r\ndemonstrable consequence of this difference is, that light darts\r\nthrough such an orifice in straight rays, while sound is diffused in\r\nall directions. Euler, not perceiving this difference, rested his\r\nanswer mainly upon a circumstance by no means {91} unimportant, that\r\nthe partitions usually employed are not impermeable to sound, as\r\nopake bodies are to light. He observes that the sound does not all\r\ncome through the aperture; for we hear, though the aperture be\r\nstopped. These were the main original points of attack and defence,\r\nand they continued nearly the same for the whole of the last\r\ncentury; the same difficulties were over and over again proposed,\r\nand the same solutions given, much in the manner of the disputations\r\nof the schoolmen of the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\9: Fischer, iv. 449.]\r\n\r\nThe struggle being thus apparently balanced, the scale was naturally\r\nturned by the general ascendancy of the Newtonian doctrines: and the\r\nemission theory was the one most generally adopted. It was still\r\nmore firmly established, in consequence of the turn generally taken\r\nby the scientific activity of the latter half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury: for while nothing was added to our knowledge of optical\r\nlaws, the chemical effects of light were studied to a considerable\r\nextent by various inquirers;[74\\9] and the opinions at which these\r\npersons arrived, they found that they could express most readily, in\r\nconsistency with the reigning chemical views, by assuming the\r\nmateriality of light. It is, however, clear, that no reasonings of\r\nthe inevitably vague and doubtful character which belong to these\r\nportions of chemistry, ought to be allowed to interfere with the\r\nsteady and regular progress of induction and generalization, founded\r\non relations of space and number, by which procedure the mechanical\r\nsciences are formed. We reject, therefore, all these chemical\r\nspeculations, as belonging to other subjects; and consider the\r\nhistory of optical theory as a blank, till we arrive at some very\r\ndifferent events, of which we have now to speak. {92}\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\9: As Scheele, Selle, Lavoisier, De Luc, Richter,\r\nLeonhardi, Gren, Girtanner, Link, Hagen, Voigt, De la Metherie,\r\nScherer, Dizé, Brugnatelli.

He was born in 1773, at Milverton in Somersetshire, of\r\nQuaker parents; and after distinguishing himself during youth by the\r\nvariety and accuracy of his attainments, he settled in London as a\r\nphysician in 1801; but continued to give much of his attention to\r\ngeneral science. His optical theory, for a long time, made few\r\nproselytes; and several years afterwards, Auguste Fresnel, an\r\neminent French mathematician, an engineer officer, took up similar\r\nviews, proved their truth, and traced their consequences, by a\r\nseries of labors almost independent of those of Dr. Young. It was\r\nnot till the theory was thus re-echoed from another land, that it\r\nwas able to take any strong hold on the attention of the countrymen\r\nof its earlier promulgator.\r\n\r\nThe theory of undulations, like that of universal gravitation, may\r\nbe divided into several successive steps of generalization. In both\r\ncases, all these steps were made by the same persons; but there is\r\nthis difference:--all the parts of the law of universal gravitation\r\nwere worked out in one burst of inspiration by its author, and\r\npublished at one time;--in the doctrine of light, on the other hand,\r\nthe different steps of the advance were made and published at\r\nseparate times, with intervals between. We see the theory in a\r\nnarrower form, and in detached portions, before the widest\r\ngeneralizations and principles of unity are reached; we see the\r\nauthors struggling with the difficulties before we see them\r\nsuccessful. They appear to us as men like ourselves, liable to\r\nperplexity and failure, instead of coming before us, as Newton does\r\nin the history of Physical Astronomy, as the irresistible and almost\r\nsupernatural hero of a philosophical romance. {93}\r\n\r\nThe main subdivisions of the great advance in physical optics, of\r\nwhich we have now to give an account, are the following:--\r\n\r\n1. The explanation of the _periodical colors_ of thin plates, thick\r\nplates, fringed shadows, striated surfaces, and other phenomena of\r\nthe same kind, by means of the doctrine of the _interference_ of\r\nundulations.\r\n\r\n2. The explanation of the phenomena of _double refraction_ by the\r\npropagation of undulations in a medium of which the optical\r\n_elasticity_ is different in different directions.\r\n\r\n3. The conception of _polarization_ as the result of the vibrations\r\nbeing _transverse_; and the consequent explanation of the production\r\nof polarization, and the necessary connexion between polarization\r\nand double refraction, on mechanical principles.\r\n\r\n4. The explanation of the phenomena of _dipolarization_, by means of\r\nthe interference of the _resolved parts_ of the vibrations after\r\ndouble refraction.\r\n\r\nThe history of each of these discoveries will be given separately to\r\na certain extent; by which means the force of proof arising from\r\ntheir combination will be more apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Explanation of the Periodical Colors of Thin Plates and\r\nShadows by the Undulatory Theory._\r\n\r\nTHE explanation of periodical colors by the principle of\r\ninterference of vibrations, was the first step which Young made in\r\nhis confirmation of the undulatory theory. In a paper on Sound and\r\nLight, dated Emmanuel College, Cambridge, 9th July, 1799, and read\r\nbefore the Royal Society in January following, he appears to incline\r\nstrongly to the Huyghenian theory; not however offering any new\r\nfacts or calculations in its favor, but pointing out the great\r\ndifficulties of the Newtonian hypothesis. But in a paper read before\r\nthe Royal Society, November 12, 1801, he says, \"A further\r\nconsideration of the colors of thin plates has converted that\r\nprepossession which I before entertained for the undulatory theory\r\nof light, into a very strong conviction of its truth and efficiency;\r\na conviction which has since been most strikingly confirmed by an\r\nanalysis of the colors of _striated surfaces_.\" He here states the\r\ngeneral principle of interferences in the form of a proposition.\r\n(Prop. viii.) \"When two undulations from different origins coincide\r\neither perfectly or very nearly in direction, their joint effect is\r\na combination of the motions belonging to them.\" He explains, by the\r\nhelp of this proposition, the colors which were observed in\r\nCoventry's {94} micrometers, in which instrument lines were drawn on\r\nglass at a distance of 1⁄500th of an inch. The interference of the\r\nundulations of the rays reflected from the two sides of these fine\r\nlines, produced periodical colors. In the same manner, he accounts\r\nfor the colors of thin plates, by the interference of the light\r\npartially reflected from the two surfaces of the plates. We have\r\nalready seen that Hooke had long before suggested the same\r\nexplanation; and Young says at the end of his paper, \"It was not\r\ntill I had satisfied myself respecting all these phenomena, that I\r\nfound in Hooke's _Micrographia_ a passage which might have led me\r\nearlier to a similar opinion.\" He also quotes from Newton many\r\npassages which assume the existence of an ether; of which, as we\r\nhave already seen, Newton suggests the necessity in these very\r\nphenomena, though he would apply it in combination with the emission\r\nof material light. In July, 1802, Young explained, on the same\r\nprinciple, some facts in indistinct vision, and other similar\r\nappearances. And in 1803,[75\\9] he speaks more positively still. \"In\r\nmaking,\" he says, \"some experiments on the fringes of colors\r\naccompanying shadows, I have found so simple and so demonstrative a\r\nproof of the general law of interference of two portions of light,\r\nwhich I have already endeavored to establish, that I think it right\r\nto lay before the Royal Society a short statement of the facts which\r\nappear to me to be thus decisive.\" The two papers just mentioned\r\ncertainly ought to have convinced all scientific men of the truth of\r\nthe doctrine thus urged; for the number and exactness of the\r\nexplanations is very remarkable. They include the colored fringes\r\nwhich are seen with the shadows of fibres; the colors produced by a\r\ndew between two pieces of glass, which, according to the theory,\r\nshould appear when the thickness of the plate is _six_ times that of\r\nthin plates, and which do so; the changes resulting from the\r\nemployment of other fluids than water; the effect of inclining the\r\nplates; also the fringes and bands which accompany shadows, the\r\nphenomena observed by Grimaldi, Newton, Maraldi, and others, and\r\nhitherto never at all reduced to rule. Young observes, very justly,\r\n\"whatever may be thought of the theory, we have got a simple and\r\ngeneral law\" of the phenomena. He moreover calculated the length of\r\nan undulation from the measurements of fringes of shadows, as he had\r\ndone before from the colors of thin plates; and found a very close\r\naccordance of the results of the various cases with one another. {95}\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\9: _Phil. Trans._ Memoir, read Nov. 24.]\r\n\r\nThere is one difficulty, and one inaccuracy, in Young's views at\r\nthis period, which it may be proper to note. The difficulty was,\r\nthat he found it necessary to suppose that light, when reflected at\r\na rarer medium, is retarded by half an undulation. This assumption,\r\nthough often urged at a later period as an argument against the\r\ntheory, was fully justified as the mechanical principles of the\r\nsubject were unfolded; and the necessity of it was clear to Young\r\nfrom the first. On the strength of this, says he, \"I ventured to\r\npredict, that if the reflections were of the same kind, made at the\r\nsurfaces of a thin plate, of a density intermediate between the\r\ndensities of the mediums surrounding it, the central spot would be\r\nwhite; and I have now the pleasure of stating, that I have fully\r\nverified this prediction by interposing a drop of oil of sassafras\r\nbetween a prism of flint-glass and a lens of crown-glass.\"\r\n\r\nThe inaccuracy of his calculations consisted in his considering the\r\nexternal fringe of shadows to be produced by the interference of a\r\nray _reflected_ from the _edge_ of the object, with a ray which\r\npasses clear of it; instead of supposing _all the parts_ of the wave\r\nof light to corroborate or interfere with one another. The\r\nmathematical treatment of the question on the latter hypothesis was\r\nby no means easy. Young was a mathematician of considerable power in\r\nthe solution of the problems which came before him: though his\r\nmethods possessed none of the analytical elegance which, in his\r\ntime, had become general in France. But it does not appear that he\r\never solved the problem of undulations as applied to fringes, with\r\nits true conditions. He did, however, rectify his conceptions of the\r\nnature of the interference; and we may add, that the numerical error\r\nof the consequences of the defective hypothesis is not such as to\r\nprevent their confirming the undulatory theory.[76\\9]\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\9: I may mention, in addition to the applications which\r\nYoung made of the principle of interferences, his _Eriometer_, an\r\ninstrument invented for the purpose of measuring the thickness of\r\nthe fibres of wood; and the explanation of the supernumerary bands\r\nof the rainbow. These explanations involve calculations founded on\r\nthe length of an undulation of light, and were confirmed by\r\nexperiment, as far as experiment went.]\r\n\r\nBut though this theory was thus so powerfully recommended by\r\nexperiment and calculation, it met with little favor in the\r\nscientific world. Perhaps this will be in some measure accounted\r\nfor, when we come, in the next chapter, to speak of the mode of its\r\nreception by {96} the supposed judges of science and letters. Its\r\nauthor went on laboring at the completion and application of the\r\ntheory in other parts of the subject; but his extraordinary success\r\nin unravelling the complex phenomena of which we have been speaking,\r\nappears to have excited none of the notice and admiration which\r\nproperly belonged to it, till Fresnel's Memoir _On Diffraction_ was\r\ndelivered to the Institute, in October, 1815.\r\n\r\nMM. Arago and Poinsot were commissioned to make a report upon this\r\nMemoir; and the former of these philosophers threw himself upon the\r\nsubject with a zeal and intelligence which peculiarly belonged to\r\nhim. He verified the laws announced by Fresnel: \"laws,\" he says,\r\n\"which appear to be destined to make an epoch in science.\" He then\r\ncast a rapid glance at the history of the subject, and recognized,\r\nat once, the place which Young occupied in it. Grimaldi, Newton,\r\nMaraldi, he states, had observed the facts, and tried in vain to\r\nreduce them to rule or cause. \"Such[77\\9] was the state of our\r\nknowledge on this difficult question, when Dr. Thomas Young made the\r\nvery remarkable experiment which is described in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1803;\" namely, that to obliterate all the bands\r\nwithin the shadow, we need only stop the ray which is going to\r\ngraze, or has grazed, one border of the object. To this, Arago added\r\nthe important observation, that the same obliteration takes place,\r\nif we stop the ray, with a transparent plate; except the plate be\r\nvery thin, in which case the bands are displaced, and not\r\nextinguished. \"Fresnel,\" says he, \"guessed the effect which a thin\r\nplate would produce, when I had told him of the effect of a thick\r\nglass.\" Fresnel himself declares[78\\9] that he was not, at the time,\r\naware of Young's previous labors. After stating nearly the same\r\nreasonings concerning fringes which Young had put forward in 1801,\r\nhe adds, \"it is therefore the meeting, the actual crossing of the\r\nrays, which produces the fringes. This consequence, which is only,\r\nso to speak, the translation of the phenomena, seems to me entirely\r\nopposed to the hypothesis of emission, and confirms the system which\r\nmakes light consist in the vibrations of a peculiar fluid.\" And thus\r\nthe Principle of Interferences, and the theory of undulations, so\r\nfar as that principle depends upon the theory, was a second time\r\nestablished by Fresnel in France, fourteen years after it had been\r\ndiscovered, fully proved, and repeatedly published by Young in\r\nEngland. {97}\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\9: _An. Chim._ 1815, Febr.]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\9: Ib. tom. xvii. p. 402.]\r\n\r\nIn this Memoir of Fresnel's, he takes very nearly the same course as\r\nYoung had done; considering the interference of the direct light\r\nwith that reflected at the edge, as the cause of the external\r\nfringes; and he observes, that in this reflection it is necessary to\r\nsuppose half an undulation lost: but a few years later, he\r\nconsidered the propagation of undulations in a more true and general\r\nmanner, and obtained the solution of this difficulty of the\r\nhalf-undulation. His more complete Memoir on _Diffraction_ was\r\ndelivered to the Institute of France, July 29, 1818; and had the\r\nprize awarded it in 1819:[79\\9] but by the delays which at that\r\nperiod occurred in the publication of the _Parisian Academical\r\nTransactions_, it was not published[80\\9] till 1826, when the theory\r\nwas no longer generally doubtful or unknown in the scientific world.\r\nIn this Memoir, Fresnel observes, that we must consider the effect\r\nof _every portion_ of a wave of light upon a distant point, and\r\nmust, on this principle, find the illumination produced by any\r\nnumber of such waves together. Hence, in general, the process of\r\nintegration is requisite; and though the integrals which here offer\r\nthemselves are of a new and difficult kind, he succeeded in making\r\nthe calculation for the cases in which he experimented. His _Table\r\nof the Correspondences of Theory and Observation_,[81\\9] is very\r\nremarkable for the closeness of the agreement; the errors being\r\ngenerally less than one hundredth of the whole, in the distances of\r\nthe black bands. He justly adds, \"A more striking agreement could\r\nnot be expected between experiment and theory. If we compare the\r\nsmallness of the differences with the extent of the breadths\r\nmeasured; and if we remark the great variations which _a_ and _b_\r\n(the distance of the object from the luminous point and from the\r\nscreen) have received in the different observations, we shall find\r\nit difficult not to regard the integral which has led us to these\r\nresults as the faithful expression of the law of the phenomena.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\9: _Ann. Chim._ May, 1819.]\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\9: _Mém. Inst._ for 1821-2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\9: _Mém. Inst._ p. 420-424.]\r\n\r\nA mathematical theory, applied, with this success, to a variety of\r\ncases of very different kinds, could not now fail to take strong\r\nhold of the attention of mathematicians; and accordingly, from this\r\ntime, the undulatory doctrine of diffraction has been generally\r\nassented to, and the mathematical difficulties which it involves,\r\nhave been duly studied and struggled with.\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable applications of the undulatory doctrine to\r\ndiffraction, we may notice those of Joseph Fraunhofer, a {98}\r\nmathematical optician of Munich. He made a great number of\r\nexperiments on the shadows produced by small holes, and groups of\r\nsmall holes, very near each other. These were published[82\\9] in his\r\n_New Modifications of Light_, in 1823. The greater part of this\r\nMemoir is employed in tracing the laws of phenomena of the extremely\r\ncomplex and splendid appearances which he obtained; but at the\r\nconclusion he observes, \"It is remarkable that the laws of the\r\nreciprocal influence and of the diffraction of the rays, can be\r\ndeduced from the principles of the undulatory theory: knowing the\r\nconditions, we may, by means of an extremely simple equation,\r\ndetermine the extent of a luminous wave for each of the different\r\ncolors; and in every case, the calculation corresponds with\r\nobservation.\" This mention of \"an extremely simple equation,\"\r\nappears to imply that he employed only Young's and Fresnel's earlier\r\nmode of calculating interferences, by considering two portions of\r\nlight, and not the method of integration. Both from the late period\r\nat which they were published, and from the absence of mathematical\r\ndetails, Fraunhofer's labors had not any strong influence on the\r\nestablishment of the undulatory theory; although they are excellent\r\nverifications of it, both from the goodness of the observations, and\r\nthe complexity and beauty of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\9: In Schumacher's _Astronomische Abhandlungen_, in French;\r\nearlier in German.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the progress of the undulatory theory in\r\nanother of its departments, according to the division already stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Explanation of Double Refraction by the Undulatory\r\nTheory._\r\n\r\nWE have traced the history of the undulatory theory applied to\r\ndiffraction, into the period when Young came to have Fresnel for his\r\nfellow-laborer. But in the mean time, Young had considered the\r\ntheory in its reference to other phenomena, and especially to those\r\nof _double refraction_.\r\n\r\nIn this case, indeed, Huyghens's explanation of the facts of Iceland\r\nspar, by means of spheroidal undulations, was so complete, and had\r\nbeen so fully confirmed by the measurements of Haüy and Wollaston,\r\nthat little remained to be done, except to connect the Huyghenian\r\nhypothesis with the mechanical views belonging to the theory, and to\r\nextend his law to other cases. The former part of this task Young\r\nexecuted, by remarking that we may conceive the _elasticity_ of the\r\n{99} crystal, on which the velocity of propagation of the\r\nluminiferous undulation depends, to be different, in the direction\r\nof the crystallographic axis, and in the direction of the planes at\r\nright angles to this axis; and from such a difference, he deduces\r\nthe existence of spheroidal undulations. This suggestion appeared in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ for November, 1809, in a critique upon an\r\nattempt of Laplace to account for the same phenomena. Laplace had\r\nproposed to reduce the double refraction of such crystals as Iceland\r\nspar, to his favorite machinery of forces which are sensible at\r\nsmall distances only. The peculiar forces which produce the effect\r\nin this case, he conceives to emanate from the crystallographic\r\naxis: so that the velocity of light within the crystal will depend\r\nonly on the situation of the ray with respect to this axis. But the\r\nestablishment of this condition is, as Young observes, the main\r\ndifficulty of the problem. How are we to conceive refracting forces,\r\nindependent of the surface of the refracting medium, and regulated\r\nonly by a certain internal line? Moreover, the law of force which\r\nLaplace was obliged to assume, namely, that it varied as the square\r\nof the sine of the angle which the ray made with the axis, could\r\nhardly be reconciled with mechanical principles. In the critique\r\njust mentioned, Young appears to feel that the undulatory theory,\r\nand perhaps he himself, had not received justice at the hands of men\r\nof science; he complains that a person so eminent in the world of\r\nscience as Laplace then was, should employ his influence in\r\npropagating error, and should disregard the extraordinary\r\nconfirmations which the Huyghenian theory had recently received.\r\n\r\nThe extension of this view, of the different elasticity of crystals\r\nin different directions, to other than uniaxal crystals, was a more\r\ncomplex and difficult problem. The general notion was perhaps\r\nobvious, after what Young had done; but its application and\r\nverification involved mathematical calculations of great generality,\r\nand required also very exact experiments. In fact, this application\r\nwas not made till Fresnel, a pupil of the Polytechnic School,\r\nbrought the resources of the modern analysis to bear upon the\r\nproblem;--till the phenomena of dipolarized light presented the\r\nproperties of biaxal crystals in a vast variety of forms;--and till\r\nthe theory received its grand impulse by the combination of the\r\nexplanation of polarization with the explanation of double\r\nrefraction. To the history of this last-mentioned great step we now\r\nproceed. {100}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Explanation of Polarization by the Undulatory Theory._\r\n\r\nEVEN while the only phenomena of _polarization_ which were known were\r\nthose which affect the two images in Iceland spar, the difficulty\r\nwhich these facts seemed at first to throw in the way of the\r\nundulatory theory was felt and acknowledged by Young. Malus's\r\ndiscovery of polarization by reflection increased the difficulty,\r\nand this Young did not attempt to conceal. In his review of the\r\npapers containing this discovery[83\\9] he says, \"The discovery\r\nrelated in these papers appears to us to be by far the most\r\nimportant and interesting which has been made in France concerning\r\nthe properties of light, at least since the time of Huyghens; and it\r\nis so much the more deserving of notice, as it greatly influences\r\nthe general balance of evidence in the comparison of the undulatory\r\nand projectile theories of the nature of light.\" He then proceeds to\r\npoint out the main features in this comparison, claiming justly a\r\ngreat advantage for the theory of undulations on the two points we\r\nhave been considering, the phenomena of diffraction and of double\r\nrefraction. And he adds, with reference to the embarrassment\r\nintroduced by polarization, that we are not to expect the course of\r\nscientific discovery to run smooth and uninterrupted; but that we\r\nare to lay our account with partial obscurity and seeming\r\ncontradiction, which we may hope that time and enlarged research\r\nwill dissipate. And thus he steadfastly held, with no blind\r\nprejudice, but with unshaken confidence, his great philosophical\r\ntrust, the fortunes of the undulatory theory. It is here, after the\r\ndifficulties of polarization had come into view, and before their\r\nsolution had been discovered, that we may place the darkest time of\r\nthe history of the theory; and at this period Young was alone in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\9: _Quart. Rev._ May, 1810.]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the light dawned upon him for some years. In\r\nthe mean time, Young found that his theory would explain dipolarized\r\ncolors; and he had the satisfaction to see Fresnel re-discover, and\r\nM. Arago adopt, his views on diffraction. He became engaged in\r\nfriendly intercourse with the latter philosopher, who visited him in\r\nEngland in 1816. On January the 12th, 1817, in writing to this\r\ngentleman, among other remarks on the subject of optics, he says, \"I\r\nhave also been reflecting on the possibility of giving an imperfect\r\nexplanation of the affection of light which constitutes\r\npolarization, {101} without departing from the genuine doctrine of\r\nundulation.\" He then proceeds to suggest the possibility of \"a\r\n_transverse_ vibration, propagated in the direction of the radius,\r\nthe motions of the particles being in a certain constant direction\r\nwith respect to that radius; and this,\" he adds, \"is\r\n_polarization_.\" From his further explanation of his views, it\r\nappears that he conceived the motions of the particles to be oblique\r\nto the direction of the ray, and not perpendicular, as the theory\r\nwas afterwards framed; but still, here was the essential condition\r\nfor the explanation of the facts of polarization,--the transverse\r\nnature of the vibrations. This idea at once made it possible to\r\nconceive how the rays of light could have _sides_; for the direction\r\nin which the vibration was transverse to the ray, might be marked by\r\npeculiar properties. And after the idea was once started, it was\r\ncomparatively easy for men like Young and Fresnel to pursue and\r\nmodify it till it assumed its true and distinct form.\r\n\r\nWe may judge of the difficulty of taking firmly hold of the\r\nconception of transverse vibrations of the ether, as those which\r\nconstitute light, by observing how long the great philosophers of\r\nwhom we are speaking lingered within reach of it, before they\r\nventured to grasp it. Fresnel says, in 1821, \"When M. Arago and I\r\nhad remarked (in 1816) that two rays polarized at right angles\r\nalways give the same quantity of light by their union, I thought\r\nthis might be explained by supposing the vibrations to be\r\ntransverse, and to be at right angles when the rays are polarized at\r\nright angles. But this supposition was so contrary to the received\r\nideas on the nature of the vibrations of elastic fluids,\" that\r\nFresnel hesitated to adopt it till he could reconcile it better to\r\nhis mechanical notions. \"Mr. Young, more bold in his conjectures,\r\nand less confiding in the views of geometers, published it before\r\nme, though perhaps he thought it after me.\" And M. Arago was\r\nafterwards wont to relate[84\\9] that when he and Fresnel had\r\nobtained their joint experimental results of the non-interference of\r\noppositely-polarized pencils, and when Fresnel pointed out that\r\ntransverse vibrations were the only possible translation of this\r\nfact into the undulatory theory, he himself protested that he had\r\nnot courage to publish such a conception; and accordingly, the\r\nsecond part of the Memoir was published in Fresnel's name alone.\r\nWhat renders this more remarkable is, that it occurred when M. Arago\r\nhad in his possession the very letter of Young, in which he proposed\r\nthe same suggestion. {102}\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\9: I take the liberty of stating this from personal\r\nknowledge.]\r\n\r\nYoung's first published statement of the doctrine of transverse\r\nvibrations was given in the explanation of the phenomena of\r\ndipolarization, of which we shall have to speak in the next Section.\r\nBut the primary and immense value of this conception, as a step in\r\nthe progress of the undulatory theory, was the connexion which it\r\nestablished between polarization and double refraction; for it held\r\nforth a promise of accounting for polarization, if any conditions\r\ncould be found which might determine what was the direction of the\r\ntransverse vibrations. The analysis of these conditions is, in a\r\ngreat measure, the work of Fresnel; a task performed with profound\r\nphilosophical sagacity and great mathematical skill.\r\n\r\nSince the double refraction of uniaxal crystals could be explained\r\nby undulations of the form of a spheroid, it was perhaps not\r\ndifficult to conjecture that the undulations of biaxal crystals\r\nwould be accounted for by undulations of the form of an ellipsoid,\r\nwhich differs from the spheroid in having its three axes unequal,\r\ninstead of two only; and consequently has that very relation to the\r\nother, in respect of symmetry, which the crystalline and optical\r\nphenomena have. Or, again, instead of supposing two different\r\ndegrees of elasticity in different directions, we may suppose three\r\nsuch different degrees in directions at right angles to each other.\r\nThis kind of generalization was tolerably obvious to a practised\r\nmathematician.\r\n\r\nBut what shall call into play all these elasticities at once, and\r\nproduce waves governed by each of them? And what shall explain the\r\ndifferent polarization of the rays which these separate waves carry\r\nwith them? These were difficult questions, to the solution of which\r\nmathematical calculation had hitherto been unable to offer any aid.\r\n\r\nIt was here that the conception of transverse vibrations came in,\r\nlike a beam of sunlight, to disclose the possibility of a mechanical\r\nconnexion of all these facts. If transverse vibrations, travelling\r\nthrough a uniform medium, come to a medium not uniform, but\r\nconstituted so that the elasticity shall be different in different\r\ndirections, in the manner we have described, what will be the course\r\nand condition of the waves in the second medium? Will the effects of\r\nsuch waves agree with the phenomena of doubly-refracted light in\r\nbiaxal crystals? Here was a problem, striking to the mathematician\r\nfor its generality and difficulty, and of deep interest to the\r\nphysical philosopher, because the fate of a great theory depended\r\nupon its solution.\r\n\r\nThe solution, obtained by great mathematical skill, was laid before\r\nthe French Institute by Fresnel in November, 1821, and was carried\r\n{103} further in two Memoirs presented in 1822. Its import is very\r\ncurious. The undulations which, coming from a distant centre, fall\r\nupon such a medium as we have described, are, it appears from the\r\nprinciples of mechanics, propagated in a manner quite different from\r\nanything which had been anticipated. The \"surface of the waves\"\r\n(that is, the surface which would bound undulations diverging from a\r\npoint), is a very complex, yet symmetrical curve surface; which, in\r\nthe case of uniaxal crystals, resolves itself into a sphere and a\r\nspheroid; but which, in general, forms a continuous double envelope\r\nof the central point to which it belongs, intersecting itself and\r\nreturning into itself. The directions of the rays are determined by\r\nthis curve surface in biaxal crystals, as in uniaxal crystals they\r\nare determined by the sphere and the spheroid; and the result is,\r\nthat in biaxal crystals, _both_ rays suffer _extraordinary_\r\nrefraction according to determinate laws. And the positions of the\r\nplanes of polarization of the two rays follow from the same\r\ninvestigation; the plane of polarization in every case being\r\nsupposed to be that which is perpendicular to the transverse\r\nvibrations. Now it appeared that the polarization of the two rays,\r\nas determined by Fresnel's theory, would be in directions, not\r\nindeed exactly accordant with the law deduced by M. Biot from\r\nexperiment, but deviating so little from those directions, that\r\nthere could be small doubt that the empirical formula was wrong, and\r\nthe theoretical one right.\r\n\r\nThe theory was further confirmed by an experiment showing that, in a\r\nbiaxal crystal (topaz), neither of the rays was refracted according\r\nto the ordinary law, though it had hitherto been supposed that one\r\nof them was so; a natural inaccuracy, since the error was\r\nsmall.[85\\9] Thus this beautiful theory corrected, while it\r\nexplained, the best of the observations which had previously been\r\nmade; and offered itself to mathematicians with an almost\r\nirresistible power of conviction. The explanation of laws so strange\r\nand diverse as those of double refraction and polarization, by the\r\nsame general and symmetrical theory, could not result from anything\r\nbut the truth of the theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\9: _An. Ch._ xxviii. p. 264.]\r\n\r\n\"Long,\" says Fresnel,[86\\9] \"before I had conceived this theory, I\r\nhad convinced myself by a pure contemplation of the facts, that it\r\nwas not possible to discover the true explanation of double\r\nrefraction, without explaining, at the same time, the phenomena of\r\npolarization, which always goes along with it; and accordingly, it\r\nwas after having found {104} what mode of vibration constituted\r\npolarization, that I caught sight of the mechanical causes of double\r\nrefraction.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\9: _Sur la Double Réf., Mém. Inst._ 1826, p. 174.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus got possession of the principle of the mechanism of\r\npolarization, Fresnel proceeded to apply it to the other cases of\r\npolarized light, with a rapidity and sagacity which reminds us of\r\nthe spirit in which Newton traced out the consequences of the\r\nprinciple of universal gravitation. In the execution of his task,\r\nindeed, Fresnel was forced upon several precarious assumptions,\r\nwhich make, even yet, a wide difference between the theory of\r\ngravitation and that of light. But the mode in which these were\r\nconfirmed by experiment, compels us to admire the happy apparent\r\nboldness of the calculator.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _polarization by reflection_ was one of those which\r\nseemed most untractable; but, by means of various artifices and\r\nconjectures, it was broken up and subdued. Fresnel began with the\r\nsimplest case, the reflection of light polarized in the plane of\r\nreflection; which he solved by means of the laws of collision of\r\nelastic bodies. He then took the reflection of light polarized\r\nperpendicularly to this plane; and here, adding to the general\r\nmechanical principles a hypothetical assumption, that the\r\ncommunication of the resolved motion parallel to the refracting\r\nsurface, takes place according to the laws of elastic bodies, he\r\nobtains his formula. These results were capable of comparison with\r\nexperiment; and the comparison, when made by M. Arago, confirmed the\r\nformulæ. They accounted, too, for Sir D. Brewster's law concerning\r\nthe polarizing angle (see Chap. vi.); and this could not but be\r\nlooked upon as a striking evidence of their having some real\r\nfoundation. Another artifice which MM. Fresnel and Arago employed,\r\nin order to trace the effect of reflection upon common light, was to\r\nuse a ray polarized in a plane making half a right angle with the\r\nplane of reflection; for the quantities of the oppositely[87\\9]\r\npolarized light in such an incident ray are equal, as they are in\r\ncommon light; but the relative quantities of the oppositely\r\npolarized light in the reflected ray are indicated by the new plane\r\nof polarization; and thus these relative quantities become known for\r\nthe case of common light. The results thus obtained were also\r\nconfirmed by facts; and in this manner, all that was doubtful in the\r\nprocess of Fresnel's reasoning, seemed to be authorized by its\r\napplication to real cases. {105}\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\9: It will be recollected all along, that _oppositely_\r\npolarized rays are those which are polarized in two planes\r\n_perpendicular_ to each other. See above, chap. vi.]\r\n\r\nThese investigations were published[88\\9] in 1821. In succeeding\r\nyears, Fresnel undertook to extend the application of his formulæ to\r\na case in which they ceased to have a meaning, or, in the language\r\nof mathematicians, became _imaginary_; namely, to the case of\r\ninternal reflection at the surface of a transparent body. It may\r\nseem strange to those who are not mathematicians, but it is\r\nundoubtedly true, that in many cases in which the solution of a\r\nproblem directs impossible arithmetical or algebraical operations to\r\nbe performed, these directions may be so interpreted as to point out\r\na true solution of the question. Such an interpretation Fresnel\r\nattempted[89\\9] in the case of which we now speak; and the result at\r\nwhich he arrived was, that the reflection of light through a rhomb\r\nof glass of a certain form (since called _Fresnel's rhomb_, would\r\nproduce a polarization of a kind altogether different from those\r\nwhich his theory had previously considered, namely, that kind which\r\nwe have spoken of as _circular polarization_. The complete\r\nconfirmation of this curious and unexpected result by trial, is\r\nanother of the extraordinary triumphs which have distinguished the\r\nhistory of the theory at every step since the commencement of\r\nFresnel's labors.\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\9: _An. Chim._ t. xvii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\9: _Bullet. des Sc._ Feb. 1823.]\r\n\r\nBut anything further which has been done in this way, may be treated\r\nof more properly in relating the verification of the theory. And we\r\nhave still to speak of the most numerous and varied class of facts\r\nto which rival theories of light were applied, and of the\r\nestablishment of the undulatory doctrine in reference to that\r\ndepartment; I mean the phenomena of depolarized, or rather, as I\r\nhave already said, _di_polarized light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Explanation of Dipolarization by the Undulatory Theory._\r\n\r\nWHEN Arago, in 1811, had discovered the colors produced by polarized\r\nlight passing through certain crystals,[90\\9] it was natural that\r\nattempts should be made to reduce them to theory. M. Biot, animated\r\nby the success of Malus in detecting the laws of double refraction,\r\nand Young, knowing the resources of his own theory, were the first\r\npersons to enter upon this undertaking. M. Biot's theory, though in\r\nthe end displaced by its rival, is well worth notice in the history\r\nof the subject. It was what he called the doctrine of _moveable\r\npolarization_. He conceived that when the molecules of light pass\r\nthrough {106} thin crystalline plates, the plane of polarization\r\nundergoes an oscillation which carries it backwards and forwards\r\nthrough a certain angle, namely, twice the angle contained between\r\nthe original plane of polarization and the principal section of the\r\ncrystal. The intervals which this oscillation occupies are lengths\r\nof the path of the ray, very minute, and different for different\r\ncolors, like Newton's fits of easy transmission; on which model,\r\nindeed, the new theory was evidently framed.[91\\9] The colors\r\nproduced in the phenomena of dipolarization really do depend, in a\r\nperiodical manner, on the length of the path of the light through\r\nthe crystal, and a theory such as M. Biot's was capable of being\r\nmodified, and was modified, so as to include the leading features of\r\nthe facts as then known; but many of its conditions being founded on\r\nspecial circumstances in the experiments, and not on the real\r\nconditions of nature, there were in it several incongruities, as\r\nwell as the general defect of its being an arbitrary and unconnected\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\9: See chap. ix.]\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\9: See MM. Arago and Biot's Memoirs, _Mém. Inst._ for 1811;\r\nthe whole volume for 1812 is a Memoir of M. Biot's (published 1814);\r\nalso _Mém. Inst._ for 1817; M. Biot's Mem. read in 1818, published\r\nin 1819 and for 1818.]\r\n\r\nYoung's mode of accounting for the brilliant phenomena of\r\ndipolarization appeared in the _Quarterly Review_ for 1814. After\r\nnoticing the discoveries of MM. Arago, Brewster, and Biot, he adds,\r\n\"We have no doubt that the surprise of these gentlemen will be as\r\ngreat as our own satisfaction in finding that they are perfectly\r\nreducible, like other causes of recurrent colors, to the general\r\nlaws of the interference of light which have been established in\r\nthis country;\" giving a reference to his former statements. The\r\nresults are then explained by the interference of the ordinary and\r\nextraordinary ray. But, as M. Arago properly observes, in his\r\naccount of this matter,[92\\9] \"It must, however, be added that Dr.\r\nYoung had not explained either in what circumstances the\r\ninterference of the rays can take place, nor why we see no colors\r\nunless the crystallized plates are exposed to light previously\r\npolarized.\" The explanation of these circumstances depends on the\r\nlaws of interference of polarized light which MM. Arago and Fresnel\r\nestablished in 1816. They then proved, by direct experiment, that\r\nwhen polarized light was treated so as to bring into view the most\r\nmarked phenomena of interference, namely, the bands of shadows;\r\npencils of light which have a common origin, and which are polarized\r\nin the parallel planes, interfere completely, while those which are\r\n{107} polarized in _opposite_ (that is, perpendicular,) planes do\r\nnot interfere at all.[93\\9] Taking these principles into the\r\naccount, Fresnel explained very completely, by means of the\r\ninterference of undulations, all the circumstances of colors\r\nproduced by crystallized plates; showing the necessity of the\r\n_polarization_ in the first instance; the _dipolarizing_ effect of\r\nthe crystal; and the office of the _analysing plate_, by which\r\ncertain portions of each of the two rays in the crystal are made to\r\ninterfere and produce color. This he did, as he says,[94\\9] without\r\nbeing aware, till Arago told him, that Young had, to some extent,\r\nanticipated him.\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\9: _Enc. Brit._ Supp. art. _Polarization._]\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\9: _Ann. Chim._ tom. x.]\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\9: Ib. tom. xvii. p. 402.]\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the history of the emission-theory of light, we see\r\nexactly what we may consider as the natural course of things in the\r\ncareer of a false theory. Such a theory may, to a certain extent,\r\nexplain the phenomena which it was at first contrived to meet; but\r\nevery new class of facts requires a new supposition,--an addition to\r\nthe machinery; and as observation goes on, these incoherent\r\nappendages accumulate, till they overwhelm and upset the original\r\nframe-work. Such was the history of the hypothesis of solid\r\nepicycles; such has been the history of the hypothesis of the\r\nmaterial emission of light. In its simple form, it explained\r\nreflection and refraction; but the colors of thin plates added to it\r\nthe hypothesis of fits of easy transmission and reflection; the\r\nphenomena of diffraction further invested the particles with complex\r\nhypothetical laws of attraction and repulsion; polarization gave\r\nthem sides; double refraction subjected them to peculiar forces\r\nemanating from the axes of crystals; finally, dipolarization loaded\r\nthem with the complex and unconnected contrivance of moveable\r\npolarization; and even when all this had been assumed, additional\r\nmechanism was wanting. There is here no unexpected success, no happy\r\ncoincidence, no convergence of principles from remote quarters; the\r\nphilosopher builds the machine, but its parts do not fit; they hold\r\ntogether only while he presses them: this is not the character of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIn the undulatory theory, on the other hand, all tends to unity and\r\nsimplicity. We explain reflection and refraction by undulations;\r\nwhen we come to thin plates, the requisite \"fits\" are already\r\ninvolved in our fundamental hypothesis, for they are the length of\r\nan undulation; the phenomena of diffraction also require such\r\nintervals; and the intervals thus required agree exactly with the\r\nothers in magnitude, {108} so that no new property is needed.\r\nPolarization for a moment checks us; but not long; for the direction\r\nof our vibrations is hitherto arbitrary;--we allow polarization to\r\ndecide it. Having done this for the sake of polarization, we find\r\nthat it also answers an entirely different purpose, that of giving\r\nthe law of double refraction. Truth may give rise to such a\r\ncoincidence; falsehood cannot. But the phenomena become more\r\nnumerous, more various, more strange; no matter: the Theory is equal\r\nto them all. It makes not a single new physical hypothesis; but out\r\nof its original stock of principles it educes the counterpart of all\r\nthat observation shows. It accounts for, explains, simplifies, the\r\nmost entangled cases; corrects known laws and facts; predicts and\r\ndiscloses unknown ones; becomes the guide of its former teacher,\r\nObservation; and, enlightened by mechanical conceptions, acquires an\r\ninsight which pierces through shape and color to force and cause.\r\n\r\nWe thus reach the philosophical _moral_ of this history, so\r\nimportant in reference to our purpose; and here we shall close the\r\naccount of the discovery and promulgation of the undulatory theory.\r\nAny further steps in its development and extension, may with\r\npropriety be noticed in the ensuing chapters, respecting its\r\nreception and verification.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [In the _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, B. xi. ch.\r\niii. Sect. 11, I have spoken of the _Consilience of Inductions_ as\r\none of the characters of scientific truth. We have several striking\r\ninstances of such consilience in the history of the undulatory\r\ntheory. The phenomena of fringes of shadows and colored bands in\r\ncrystals _jump together_ in the Theory of Vibrations. The phenomena\r\nof polarization and double refraction _jump together_ in the Theory\r\nof Crystalline Vibrations. The phenomena of polarization and of the\r\ninterference of polarized rays _jump together_ in the Theory of\r\nTransverse Vibrations.\r\n\r\nThe proof of what is above said of the undulatory theory is\r\ncontained in the previous history. This theory has \"accounted for,\r\nexplained, and simplified the most entangled cases;\" as the cases of\r\nfringes of shadows; shadows of gratings; colored bands in biaxal\r\ncrystals, and in quartz. There are no optical phenomena more\r\nentangled than these. It has \"corrected experimental laws,\" as in\r\nthe case of M. Biot's law of the direction of polarization in biaxal\r\ncrystals. It has done this, \"without making any new physical\r\nhypothesis;\" for the transverse direction of vibrations, the\r\ndifferent optical elasticities of crystals in different directions,\r\nand (if it be adopted) the hypothesis of finite {109} intervals of\r\nthe particles (see chap. x. and hereafter, chap. xiii.), are only\r\nlimitations of what was indefinite in the earlier form of the\r\nhypothesis. And so far as the properties of visible radiant light\r\nare concerned, I do not think it at all too much to say, as M.\r\nSchwerd has said, that \"the undulation theory accounts for the\r\nphenomena as completely as the theory of gravitation does for the\r\nfacts of the solar system.\"\r\n\r\nThis we might say, even if some facts were not yet fully explained;\r\nfor there were till very lately, if there are not still, such\r\nunexplained facts with regard to the theory of gravitation,\r\npresented to us by the solar system. With regard to the undulatory\r\ntheory, these exceptions are, I think, disappearing quite as rapidly\r\nand as completely as in the case of gravitation. It is to be\r\nobserved that no presumption against the theory can with any show of\r\nreason be collected from the cases in which classes of phenomena\r\nremain unexplained, the theory having never been applied to them by\r\nany mathematician capable of tracing its results correctly. The\r\nhistory of the theory of gravitation may show us abundantly how\r\nnecessary it is to bear in mind this caution; and the results of the\r\nundulatory theory cannot be traced without great mathematical skill\r\nand great labor, any more than those of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThis remark applies to such cases as that of the _transverse fringes\r\nof grooved surfaces_. The general phenomena of these cases are\r\nperfectly explained by the theory. But there is an interruption in\r\nthe light in an oblique direction, which has not yet been explained;\r\nbut looking at what has been done in other cases, it is impossible\r\nto doubt that this phenomenon depends upon the results of certain\r\nintegrations, and would be explained if these were rightly performed.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of _crystallized surfaces_, and especially their\r\neffects upon the plane of polarization, were examined by Sir D.\r\nBrewster, and laws of the phenomena made out by him with his usual\r\nskill and sagacity. For a time these were unexplained by the theory.\r\nBut recently Mr. Mac Cullagh has traced the consequences of the\r\ntheory in this case,[95\\9] and obtained a law which represents with\r\nmuch exactness, Sir D. Brewster's observation.\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\9: Prof. Lloyd's _Report, Brit. Assoc._ 1834, p. 374.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which Sir D. Brewster, in 1837, called a _new property\r\nof light_, (certain appearances of the spectrum when the pupil of\r\nthe eye is half covered with a thin glass or crystal,) have been\r\nexplained by Mr. Airy in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1840.\r\n\r\nMr. Airy's explanation of the phenomena termed by Sir D. {110}\r\nBrewster a _new property of light_, is completed in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ for November, 1846. It is there shown that\r\na dependence of the breadth of the bands upon the aperture of the\r\npupil, which had been supposed to result from the theory, and which\r\ndoes not appear in the experiment, did really result from certain\r\nlimited conditions of the hypothesis, which conditions do not belong\r\nto the experiment; and that when the problem is solved without those\r\nlimitations, the discrepance of theory and observation vanishes; so\r\nthat, as Mr. Airy says, \"this very remarkable experiment, which long\r\nappeared inexplicable, seems destined to give one of the strongest\r\nconfirmations to the Undulatory Theory.\"\r\n\r\nI may remark also that there is no force in the objection which has\r\nbeen urged against the admirers of the undulatory theory, that by\r\nthe fulness of their assent to it, they discourage further\r\nresearches which may contradict or confirm it. We must, in this\r\npoint of view also, look at the course of the theory of gravitation\r\nand its results. The acceptance of that theory did not prevent\r\nmathematicians and observers from attending to the apparent\r\nexceptions, but on the contrary, stimulated them to calculate and to\r\nobserve with additional zeal, and still does so. The acceleration of\r\nthe Moon, the mutual disturbances of Jupiter and Saturn, the motions\r\nof Jupiter's Satellites, the effect of the Earth's oblateness on the\r\nMoon's motion, the motions of the Moon about her own centre, and\r\nmany other phenomena, were studied with the greater attention,\r\n_because_ the general theory was deemed so convincing: and the same\r\ncause makes the remaining exceptions objects of intense interest to\r\nastronomers and mathematicians. The mathematicians and optical\r\nexperimenters who accept the undulatory theory, will of course\r\nfollow out their conviction in the same manner. Accordingly, this\r\nhas been done and is still doing, as in Mr. Airy's mathematical\r\ninvestigation of the effect of an annular aperture; Mr. Earnshaw's,\r\nof the effect of a triangular aperture; Mr. Talbot's explanation of\r\nthe effect of interposing a film of mica between a part of the pupil\r\nand the pure spectrum, so nearly approaching to the phenomena which\r\nhave been spoken of as a new Polarity of Light; besides other labors\r\nof eminent mathematicians, elsewhere mentioned in these pages.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the _absorption_ of light have no especial bearing\r\nupon the undulatory theory. There is not much difficulty in\r\nexplaining the _possibility_ of absorption upon the theory. When the\r\nlight is absorbed, it ceases to belong to the theory. {111}\r\n\r\nFor, as I have said, the theory professes only to explain the\r\nphenomena of _radiant visible_ light. We know very well that light\r\nhas other bearings and properties. It produces chemical effects. The\r\noptical polarity of crystals is connected with the chemical polarity\r\nof their constitution. The natural colors of bodies, too, are\r\nconnected with their chemical constitution. Light is also connected\r\nwith heat. The undulatory theory does not undertake to explain these\r\nproperties and their connexion. If it did, it would be a Theory of\r\nHeat and of Chemical Composition, as well as a Theory of Light.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday's recent experiments have shown that the magnetic\r\npolarity is directly connected with that optical polarity by which\r\nthe plane of polarization is affected. When the lines of magnetic\r\nforce pass through certain transparent bodies, they communicate to\r\nthem a certain kind of circular polarizing power; yet different from\r\nthe circular polarizing power of quartz, and certain fluids\r\nmentioned in chapter ix.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may be allowed to refer to this discovery as a further\r\nillustration of the views I have offered in the _Philosophy of the\r\nInductive Sciences_ respecting the _Connexion of Co-existent\r\nPolarities_. (B. v. Chap. ii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE EPOCH OF YOUNG AND FRESNEL. RECEPTION OF THE\r\nUNDULATORY THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Young, in 1800, published his assertion of the Principle of\r\nInterferences, as the true theory of optical phenomena, the\r\ncondition of England was not very favorable to a fair appreciation\r\nof the value of the new opinion. The men of science were strongly\r\npre-occupied in favor of the doctrine of emission, not only from a\r\nnational interest in Newton's glory, and a natural reverence for his\r\nauthority, but also from deference towards the geometers of France,\r\nwho were looked up to as our masters in the application of\r\nmathematics to physics, and who were understood to be Newtonians in\r\nthis as in other subjects. A general tendency to an atomic\r\nphilosophy, which had begun to appear from the time of Newton,\r\noperated powerfully; and {112} the hypothesis of emission was so\r\neasily conceived, that, when recommended by high authority, it\r\neasily became popular; while the hypothesis of luminiferous\r\nundulations, unavoidably difficult to comprehend, even by the aid of\r\nsteady thought, was neglected, and all but forgotten.\r\n\r\nYet the reception which Young's opinions met with was more harsh\r\nthan he might have expected, even taking into account all these\r\nconsiderations. But there was in England no visible body of men,\r\nfitted by their knowledge and character to pronounce judgment on\r\nsuch a question, or to give the proper impulse and bias to public\r\nopinion. The Royal Society, for instance, had not, for a long time,\r\nby custom or institution, possessed or aimed at such functions. The\r\nwriters of \"Reviews\" alone, self-constituted and secret tribunals,\r\nclaimed this kind of authority. Among these publications, by far the\r\nmost distinguished about this period was the _Edinburgh Review_;\r\nand, including among its contributors men of eminent science and\r\ngreat talents, employing also a robust and poignant style of writing\r\n(often certainly in a very unfair manner), it naturally exercised\r\ngreat influence. On abstruse doctrines, intelligible to few persons,\r\nmore than on other subjects, the opinions and feelings expressed in\r\na Review must be those of the individual reviewer. The criticism on\r\nsome of Young's early papers on optics was written by Mr.\r\n(afterwards Lord) Brougham, who, as we have seen, had experimented\r\non diffraction, following the Newtonian view, that of inflexion. Mr.\r\nBrougham was perhaps at this time young enough[96\\9] to be somewhat\r\nintoxicated with the appearance of judicial authority in matters of\r\nscience, which his office of anonymous reviewer gave him: and even\r\nin middle-life, he was sometimes considered to be prone to indulge\r\nhimself in severe and sarcastic expressions. In January, 1803, was\r\npublished[97\\9] his critique on Dr. Young's Bakerian Lecture, _On\r\nthe Theory of Light and Colors_, in which lecture the doctrine of\r\nundulations and the law of interferences was maintained. This\r\ncritique was an uninterrupted strain of blame and rebuke. \"This\r\npaper,\" the reviewer said, \"contains nothing which deserves the name\r\neither of experiment or discovery.\" He charged the writer with\r\n\"dangerous relaxations of the principles of physical logic.\" \"We\r\nwish,\" he cried, \"to recall philosophers to the strict and severe\r\nmethods of investigation,\" describing them as those pointed out by\r\nBacon, Newton, and the like. Finally, Dr. Young's speculations {113}\r\nwere spoken of as a hypothesis, which is a mere work of fancy; and\r\nthe critic added, \"we cannot conclude our review without entreating\r\nthe attention of the Royal Society, which has admitted of late so\r\nmany hasty and unsubstantial papers into its _Transactions_;\" which\r\nhabit he urged them to reform. The same aversion to the undulatory\r\ntheory appears soon after in another article by the same reviewer,\r\non the subject of Wollaston's measures of the refraction of Iceland\r\nspar; he says, \"We are much disappointed to find that so acute and\r\ningenious an experimentalist should have adopted the wild optical\r\ntheory of vibrations.\" The reviewer showed ignorance as well as\r\nprejudice in the course of his remarks; and Young drew up an answer,\r\nwhich was ably written, but being published separately had little\r\ncirculation. We can hardly doubt that these Edinburgh reviews had\r\ntheir effect in confirming the general disposition to reject the\r\nundulatory theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\9: His age was twenty-four.]\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\9: _Edin. Review_, vol. i. p. 450.]\r\n\r\nWe may add, however, that Young's mode of presenting his opinions\r\nwas not the most likely to win them favor; for his mathematical\r\nreasonings placed them out of the reach of popular readers, while\r\nthe want of symmetry and system in his symbolical calculations,\r\ndeprived them of attractiveness for the mathematician. He himself\r\ngave a very just criticism of his own style of writing, in speaking\r\non another of his works:[98\\9] \"The mathematical reasoning, for want\r\nof mathematical symbols, was not understood, even by tolerable\r\nmathematicians. From a dislike of the affectation of algebraical\r\nformality which he had observed in some foreign authors, he was led\r\ninto something like an affectation of simplicity, which was equally\r\ninconvenient to a scientific reader.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\9: See _Life of Young_, p. 54.]\r\n\r\nYoung appears to have been aware of his own deficiency in the power\r\nof drawing public favor, or even notice, to his discoveries. In\r\n1802, Davy writes to a friend, \"Have you seen the theory of my\r\ncolleague, Dr. Young, on the undulations of an ethereal medium as\r\nthe cause of light? It is not likely to be a popular hypothesis,\r\nafter what has been said by Newton concerning it. He would be very\r\nmuch flattered if you could offer any observations upon it, _whether\r\nfor or against it_.\" Young naturally felt confident in his power of\r\nrefuting objections, and wanted only the opportunity of a public\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nDr. Brewster, who was, at this period, enriching optical knowledge\r\nwith so vast a train of new phenomena and laws, shared the general\r\naversion to the undulatory theory, which, indeed, he hardly overcame\r\n{114} thirty years later. Dr. Wollaston was a person whose character\r\nled him to look long at the laws of phenomena, before he attempted\r\nto determine their causes; and it does not appear that he had\r\ndecided the claims of the rival theories in his own mind. Herschel\r\n(I now speak of the son) had at first the general mathematical\r\nprejudice in favor of the emission doctrine. Even when he had\r\nhimself studied and extended the laws of dipolarized phenomena, he\r\ntranslated them into the language of the theory of moveable\r\npolarization. In 1819, he refers to, and corrects, this theory; and\r\nsays, it is now \"relieved from every difficulty, and entitled to\r\nrank with the fits of easy transmission and reflection as a general\r\nand simple physical law;\" a just judgment, but one which now conveys\r\nless of praise than he then intended. At a later period, he remarked\r\nthat we cannot be certain that if the theory of emission had been as\r\nmuch cultivated as that of undulation, it might not have been as\r\nsuccessful; an opinion which was certainly untenable after the fair\r\ntrial of the two theories in the case of diffraction, and\r\nextravagant after Fresnel's beautiful explanation of double\r\nrefraction and polarization. Even in 1827, in a _Treatise on Light_,\r\npublished in the _Encyclopædia Metropolitana_, he gives a section to\r\nthe calculations of the Newtonian theory; and appears to consider\r\nthe rivalry of the theories as still subsisting. But yet he there\r\nspeaks with a proper appreciation of the advantages of the new\r\ndoctrine. After tracing the prelude to it, he says, \"But the\r\nunpursued speculations of Newton, and the opinions of Hooke, however\r\ndistinct, must not be put in competition, and, indeed, ought\r\nscarcely to be mentioned, with the elegant, simple, and\r\ncomprehensive theory of Young,--a theory which, if not founded in\r\nnature, is certainly one of the happiest fictions that the genius of\r\nman ever invented to grasp together natural phenomena, which, at\r\ntheir first discovery, seemed in irreconcileable opposition to it.\r\nIt is, in fact, in all its applications and details, one succession\r\nof _felicities_; insomuch, that we may almost be induced to say, if\r\nit be not true, it deserves to be so.\"\r\n\r\nIn France, Young's theory was little noticed or known, except\r\nperhaps by M. Arago, till it was revived by Fresnel. And though\r\nFresnel's assertion of the undulatory theory was not so rudely\r\nreceived as Young's had been, it met with no small opposition from\r\nthe older mathematicians, and made its way slowly to the notice and\r\ncomprehension of men of science. M. Arago would perhaps have at once\r\nadopted the conception of transverse vibrations, when it was\r\nsuggested by his fellow-laborer, Fresnel, if it had not been that he\r\nwas a member of the {115} Institute, and had to bear the brunt of\r\nthe war, in the frequent discussions on the undulatory theory; to\r\nwhich theory Laplace, and other leading members, were so vehemently\r\nopposed, that they would not even listen with toleration to the\r\narguments in its favor. I do not know how far influences of this\r\nkind might operate in producing the delays which took place in the\r\npublication of Fresnel's papers. We have seen that he arrived at the\r\nconception of transverse vibrations in 1816, as the true key to the\r\nunderstanding of polarization. In 1817 and 1818, in a memoir read to\r\nthe Institute, he analysed and explained the perplexing phenomena of\r\nquartz, which he ascribed to a _circular polarization_. This memoir\r\nhad not been printed, nor any extract from it inserted in the\r\nscientific journals, in 1822, when he confirmed his views by further\r\nexperiments.[99\\9] His remarkable memoir, which solved the\r\nextraordinary and capital problem of the connexion of double\r\nrefraction and crystallization, though written in 1821, was not\r\npublished till 1827. He appears by this time to have sought other\r\nchannels of publication. In 1822, he gave,[100\\9] in the _Annales de\r\nChimie et de Physique_, an explanation of refraction on the\r\nprinciples of the undulatory theory; alleging, as the reason for\r\ndoing so, that the theory was still little known. And in succeeding\r\nyears there appeared in the same work, his theory of reflection. His\r\nmemoir on this subject (_Mémoire sur la Loi des Modifications que la\r\nRéflexion imprime à la Lumière Polarisée_,) was read to the Academy\r\nof Sciences in **1823. But the original paper was mislaid, and, for a\r\ntime, supposed to be lost; it has since been recovered among the\r\npapers of M. Fourier, and printed in the eleventh volume of the\r\nMemoirs of the Academy.[101\\9] Some of the speculations to which he\r\nrefers, as communicated to the Academy, have never yet\r\nappeared.[102\\9]\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\9: Hersch. _Light_, p. 539.]\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\9: _Ann. de Chim._ 1822, tom. xxi. p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\9: Lloyd. _Report on Optics_, p. 363. (Fourth Rep. of\r\nBrit. Ass.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\9: Ib. p. 316, _note._]\r\n\r\nStill Fresnel's labors were, from the first, duly appreciated by\r\nsome of the most eminent of his countrymen. His _Memoir on\r\nDiffraction_ was, as we have seen, crowned in 1819: and, in 1822, a\r\nReport upon his _Memoir on Double Refraction_ was drawn up by a\r\ncommission consisting of MM. Ampère, Fourier, and Arago. In this\r\nreport[103\\9] Fresnel's theory is spoken of as confirmed by the most\r\ndelicate tests. The reporters add, respecting his \"theoretical ideas\r\non the particular kind of undulations which, according to him,\r\nconstitute light,\" that \"it would be impossible for them to\r\npronounce at present a decided {116} judgment,\" but that \"they have\r\nnot thought it right to delay any longer making known a work of\r\nwhich the difficulty is attested by the fruitless efforts of the\r\nmost skilful philosophers, and in which are exhibited in the same\r\nbrilliant degree, the talent for experiment and the spirit of\r\ninvention.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\9: _Ann. Chim._ tom. xx. p. 343.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, a controversy between the theory of\r\nundulations and the theory of moveable polarization which M. Biot\r\nhad proposed with a view of accounting for the colors produced by\r\ndipolarizing crystals, had occurred among the French men of science.\r\nIt is clear that in some main features the two theories coincide;\r\nthe intervals of interference in the one theory being represented by\r\nthe intervals of the oscillations in the other. But these intervals\r\nin M. Biot's explanations were arbitrary hypotheses, suggested by\r\nthese very facts themselves; in Fresnel's theory, they were\r\nessential parts of the general scheme. M. Biot, indeed, does not\r\nappear to have been averse from a coalition; for he allowed[104\\9]\r\nto Fresnel that \"the theory of undulations took the phenomena at a\r\nhigher point and carried them further.\" And M. Biot could hardly\r\nhave dissented from M. Arago's account of the matter, that Fresnel's\r\nviews \"_linked together_\"[105\\9] the oscillations of moveable\r\npolarization. But Fresnel, whose hypothesis was all of one piece,\r\ncould give up no part of it, although he allowed the usefulness of\r\nM. Biot's formulæ. Yet M. Biot's speculations fell in better with\r\nthe views of the leading mathematicians of Paris. We may consider as\r\nevidence of the favor with which they were looked upon, the large\r\nspace they occupy in the volumes of the Academy for 1811, 1812,\r\n1817, and 1818. In 1812, the entire volume is filled with a memoir\r\nof M. Biot's on the subject of moveable polarization. This doctrine\r\nalso had some advantage in coming early before the world in a\r\ndidactic form, in his _Traité de Physique_, which was published in\r\n1816, and was the most complete treatise on general physics which\r\nhad appeared up to that time. In this and others of this author's\r\nwritings, he expresses facts so entirely in the terms of his own\r\nhypothesis, that it is difficult to separate the two. In the sequel\r\nM. Arago was the most prominent of M. Biot's opponents; and in his\r\nreport upon Fresnel's memoir on the colors of crystalline plates, he\r\nexposed the weaknesses of the theory of moveable polarization with\r\nsome severity. The details of this controversy need not occupy us;\r\nbut we may observe that this may be considered as the last struggle\r\n{117} in favor of the theory of emission among mathematicians of\r\neminence. After this crisis of the war, the theory of moveable\r\npolarization lost its ground; and the explanations of the undulatory\r\ntheory, and the calculations belonging to it, being published in the\r\n_Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, of which M. Arago was one of the\r\nconductors, soon diffused it over Europe.\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\9: _Ann. Chim._ tom. xvii. p. 251.]\r\n\r\n[Note 105\\9: \"Nouait\".]\r\n\r\nIt was probably in consequence of the delays to which we have\r\nreferred, in the publication of Fresnel's memoirs, that as late as\r\nDecember, 1826, the Imperial Academy at St Petersburg proposed, as\r\none of their prize-questions for the two following years, this,--\"To\r\ndeliver the optical system of waves from all the objections which\r\nhave (as it appears) with justice been urged against it, and to\r\napply it to the polarization and double refraction of light.\" In the\r\nprogramme to this announcement, Fresnel's researches on the subject\r\nare not alluded to, though his memoir on diffraction is noticed;\r\nthey were, therefore, probably not known to the Russian Academy.\r\n\r\nYoung was always looked upon as a person of marvellous variety of\r\nattainments and extent of knowledge; but during his life he hardly\r\nheld that elevated place among great discoverers which posterity\r\nwill probably assign him. In 1802, he was constituted Foreign\r\nSecretary of the Royal Society, an office which he held during life;\r\nin 1827 he was elected one of the eight Foreign Members of the\r\nInstitute of France; perhaps the greatest honor which men of science\r\nusually receive. The fortune of his life in some other respects was\r\nof a mingled complexion. His profession of a physician occupied,\r\nsufficiently to fetter, without rewarding him; while he was Lecturer\r\nat the Royal Institution, he was, in his lectures, too profound to\r\nbe popular; and his office of Superintendent of the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_ subjected him to much minute labor, and many petulant\r\nattacks of pamphleteers. On the other hand, he had a leading part in\r\nthe discovery of the long-sought key to the Egyptian hieroglyphics;\r\nand thus the age which was marked by two great discoveries, one in\r\nscience and one in literature, owed them both in a great measure to\r\nhim. Dr. Young died in 1829, when he had scarcely completed his\r\nfifty-sixth year. Fresnel was snatched from science still more\r\nprematurely, dying, in 1827, at the early age of thirty-nine.\r\n\r\nWe need not say that both these great philosophers possessed, in an\r\neminent degree, the leading characteristics of the discoverer's\r\nmind, perfect clearness of view, rich fertility of invention, and\r\nintense love of knowledge. We cannot read without great interest a\r\nletter of {118} Fresnel to Young,[106\\9] in November, 1824: \"For a\r\nlong time that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love\r\nof glory, is much blunted in me. I labor much less to catch the\r\nsuffrages of the public, than to obtain an inward approval which has\r\nalways been the sweetest reward of my efforts. Without doubt I have\r\noften wanted the spur of vanity to excite me to pursue my researches\r\nin moments of disgust and discouragement. But all the compliments\r\nwhich I have received from MM. Arago, De Laplace, or Biot, never\r\ngave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretical truth, or\r\nthe confirmation of a calculation by experiment.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 106\\9: I was able to give this, and some other extracts, from\r\nthe then unedited correspondence of Young and Fresnel, by the\r\nkindness of (the Dean of Ely) Professor Peacock, of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, whose Life of Dr. Young has since been published.]\r\n\r\nThough Young and Fresnel were in years the contemporaries of many\r\nwho are now alive, we must consider ourselves as standing towards\r\nthem in the relation of posterity. The Epoch of Induction in Optics\r\nis past; we have now to trace the Verification and Application of\r\nthe true theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCONFIRMATION AND EXTENSION OF THE UNDULATORY THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the undulatory theory had been developed in all its main\r\nfeatures, by its great authors, Young and Fresnel, although it bore\r\nmarks of truth that could hardly be fallacious, there was still\r\nhere, as in the case of other great theories, a period in which\r\ndifficulties were to be removed, objections answered, men's minds\r\nfamiliarized to the new conceptions thus presented to them; and in\r\nwhich, also, it might reasonably be expected that the theory would\r\nbe extended to facts not at first included in its domain. This\r\nperiod is, indeed, that in which we are living; and we might,\r\nperhaps with propriety, avoid the task of speaking of our living\r\ncontemporaries. But it would be unjust to the theory not to notice\r\nsome of the remarkable events, characteristic of such a period,\r\nwhich have already occurred; and this may be done very simply. {119}\r\n\r\nIn the case of this great theory, as in that of gravitation, by far\r\nthe most remarkable of these confirmatory researches were conducted\r\nby the authors of the discovery, especially Fresnel. And in looking\r\nat what he conceived and executed for this purpose, we are, it\r\nappears to me, strongly reminded of Newton, by the wonderful\r\ninventiveness and sagacity with which he devised experiments, and\r\napplied to them mathematical reasonings.\r\n\r\n1. _Double Refraction of Compressed Glass._--One of these\r\nconfirmatory experiments was the production of double refraction by\r\nthe compression of glass. Fresnel observes,[107\\9] that though Sir\r\nD. Brewster had shown that glass under compression produced colors\r\nresembling those which are given by doubly-refracting crystals,\r\n\"very skilful physicists had not considered those experiments as a\r\nsufficient proof of the bifurcation of the light.\" In the hypothesis\r\nof moveable polarization, it is added, there is no apparent\r\nconnexion between these phenomena of coloration and double\r\nrefraction; but on Young's theory, that the colors arise from two\r\nrays which have traversed the crystal with different velocities, it\r\nappears almost unavoidable to admit also a difference of path in the\r\ntwo rays.\r\n\r\n[Note 107\\9: _Ann. de Chim._ 1822, tom. xx. p. 377.]\r\n\r\n\"Though,\" he says, \"I had long since adopted this opinion, it did\r\nnot appear to me so completely demonstrated, that it was right to\r\nneglect an experimental verification of it;\" and therefore, in 1819,\r\nhe proceeded to satisfy himself of the fact, by the phenomena of\r\ndiffraction. The trial left no doubt on the subject; but he still\r\nthought it would be interesting actually to produce two images in\r\nglass by compression; and by a highly-ingenious combination,\r\ncalculated to exaggerate the effect of the double refraction, which\r\nis very feeble, even when the compression is most intense, he\r\nobtained two distinct images. This evidence of the dependence of\r\ndipolarizing structure upon a doubly-refracting state of particles,\r\nthus excogitated out of the general theory, and verified by trial,\r\nmay well be considered, as he says, \"as a new occasion of proving\r\nthe infallibility of the principle of interferences.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Circular Polarization._--Fresnel then turned his attention to\r\nanother set of experiments, related to this indeed, but by a tie so\r\nrecondite, that nothing less than his clearness and acuteness of\r\nview could have detected any connexion. The optical properties of\r\nquartz had been perceived to be peculiar, from the period of the\r\ndiscovery {120} of dipolarized colors by MM. Arago and Biot. At the\r\nend of the Notice just quoted, Fresnel says,[108\\9] \"As soon as my\r\noccupations permit me, I propose to employ a pile of prisms similar\r\nto that which I have described, in order to study the double\r\nrefraction of the rays which traverse crystals of quartz in the\r\ndirection of the axis.\" He then ventures, without hesitation, to\r\ndescribe beforehand what the phenomena will be. In the _Bulletin des\r\nSciences_[109\\9] for December, 1822, it is stated that experiment\r\nhad confirmed what he had thus announced.\r\n\r\n[Note 108\\9: _Ann. de Chim._ 1822, tom. xx. p. 382.]\r\n\r\n[Note 109\\9: Ib. _Ann. de Chim._ 1822, tom. xx. p. 191.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena are those which have since been spoken of as _circular\r\npolarization_; and the term first occurs in this notice.[110\\9] They\r\nare very remarkable, both by their resemblances to, and their\r\ndifferences from, the phenomena of _plane-polarized_ light. And the\r\nmanner in which Fresnel was led to this anticipation of the facts is\r\nstill more remarkable than the facts themselves. Having ascertained\r\nby observation that two differently-polarized rays, totally\r\nreflected at the internal surface of glass, suffer different\r\n_retardations_ of their undulations, he applied the formulæ which he\r\nhad obtained for the polarizing effect of reflection to this case.\r\nBut in this case the formulæ expressed an impossibility; yet as\r\nalgebraical formulæ, even in such cases, have often some meaning, \"I\r\ninterpreted,\" he says,[111\\9] \"in the manner which appeared to me\r\nmost natural and most probable, what the analysis indicated by this\r\nimaginary form;\" and by such an interpretation he collected the law\r\nof the difference of undulation of the two rays. He was thus able to\r\npredict that by two internal reflections in a _rhomb_, or\r\nparallelopiped of glass, of a certain form and position, a polarized\r\nray would acquire a circular undulation of its particles; and this\r\nconstitution of the ray, it appeared, by reasoning further, would\r\nshow itself by its possessing peculiar properties, partly the same\r\nas those of polarized light, and partly different. This\r\nextraordinary anticipation was exactly confirmed; and thus the\r\napparently bold and strange guess of the author was fully justified,\r\nor at least assented to, even by the most cautious philosophers. \"As\r\nI cannot appreciate the mathematical evidence for the nature of\r\ncircular polarization,\" says Prof. Airy,[112\\9] \"I shall mention the\r\nexperimental evidence on which I receive it.\" The conception has\r\nsince been universally adopted.\r\n\r\n[Note 110\\9: Ib. p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Note 111\\9: _Bullet. des Sc._ 1823, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Note 112\\9: _Camb. Trans._ vol. iv. p. 81, 1831.]\r\n\r\nBut Fresnel, having thus obtained circularly-polarized rays, saw\r\n{121} that he could account for the phenomena of quartz, already\r\nobserved by M. Arago, as we have noticed in Chap. ix., by supposing\r\ntwo circularly-polarized rays to pass, with different velocities,\r\nalong the axis. The curious succession of colors, following each\r\nother in right-handed or left-handed circular order, of which we\r\nhave already spoken, might thus be hypothetically explained.\r\n\r\nBut was this hypothesis of two circularly-polarized rays, travelling\r\nalong the axis of such crystals, to be received, merely because it\r\naccounted for the phenomena? Fresnel's ingenuity again enabled him\r\nto avoid such a defect in theorizing. If there were two such rays,\r\nthey might be visibly separated[113\\9] by the same artifice, of a\r\npile of prisms properly achromatized, which he had used for\r\ncompressed glass. The result was, that he did obtain a visible\r\nseparation of the rays; and this result has since been confirmed by\r\nothers, for instance. Professor Airy.[114\\9] The rays were found to\r\nbe in all respects identical with the circularly-polarized rays\r\nproduced by the internal reflections in Fresnel's rhomb. This kind\r\nof double refraction gave a hypothetical explanation of the laws\r\nwhich M. Biot had obtained for the phenomena of this class; for\r\nexample,[115\\9] the rule, that the deviation of the plane of\r\npolarization of the emergent ray is inversely as the square of the\r\nlength of an undulation for each kind of rays. And thus the\r\nphenomena produced by light passing along the axis of quartz were\r\nreduced into complete conformity with the theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 113\\9: _Bull. des Sc._ 1822, p. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Note 114\\9: _Cambridge Trans._ iv. p. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Note 115\\9: _Bull. des Sc._ 1822, p. 197.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I believe, however, Fresnel did not deduce the phenomenon\r\nfrom the mathematical formula, without the previous suggestion of\r\nexperiment. He _observed_ appearances which implied a difference of\r\nretardation in the two differently-polarized rays at total\r\nreflection; as Sir D. Brewster observed in reflection of metals\r\nphenomena having a like character. The general fact being observed,\r\nFresnel used the theory to discover the law of this retardation, and\r\nto determine a construction in which, one ray being a quarter of an\r\nundulation retarded more than the other, circular polarization would\r\nbe produced. And this anticipation was verified by the construction\r\nof his _rhomb_.\r\n\r\nAs a still more curious verification of this law, another of\r\nFresnel's experiments may be mentioned. He found the proper angles\r\nfor a circularly-polarizing glass rhomb on the supposition that\r\nthere were {122} _four_ internal reflections instead of two; two of\r\nthe four taking place when the surface of the glass was dry, and two\r\nwhen it was wet. The rhomb was made; and when all the points of\r\nreflection were dry, the light was not circularly polarized; when\r\ntwo points were wet, the light was circularly polarized; and when\r\nall four were wet, it was not circularly polarized.]\r\n\r\n3. _Elliptical Polarization in Quartz._--We now come to one of the\r\nfew additions to Fresnel's theory which have been shown to be\r\nnecessary. He had accounted fully for the colors produced by the\r\nrays which travel _along the axis_ of quartz crystals; and thus, for\r\nthe colors and changes of the central spot which is produced when\r\npolarized light passes through a transverse plate of such crystals.\r\nBut this central spot is surrounded by rings of colors. How is the\r\ntheory to be extended to these?\r\n\r\nThis extension has been successfully made by Professor Airy.[116\\9]\r\nHis hypothesis is, that as rays passing along the axis of a quartz\r\ncrystal are circularly polarized, rays which are oblique to the axis\r\nare elliptically polarized, the amount of ellipticity depending, in\r\nsome unknown manner, upon the obliquity; and that each ray is\r\nseparated by double refraction into two rays polarized elliptically;\r\nthe one right-handed, the other left-handed. By means of these\r\nsuppositions, he not only was enabled to account for the simple\r\nphenomena of single plates of quartz; but for many most complex and\r\nintricate appearances which arise from the superposition of two\r\nplates, and which at first sight might appear to defy all attempts\r\nto reduce them to law and symmetry; such as spirals, curves\r\napproaching to a square form, curves broken in four places. \"I can\r\nhardly imagine,\" he says,[117\\9] very naturally, \"that any other\r\nsupposition would represent the phenomena to such extreme accuracy.\r\nI am not so much struck with the accounting for the continued\r\ndilatation of circles, and the general representation of the forms\r\nof spirals, as with the explanations of the minute deviations from\r\nsymmetry; as when circles become almost square, and crosses are\r\ninclined to the plane of polarization. And I believe that any one\r\nwho shall follow my investigation, and imitate my experiments, will\r\nbe surprised at their perfect agreement.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 116\\9: _Camb. Trans._, iv. p. 83, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Note 117\\9: _Camb. Trans._, iv. p. 122.]\r\n\r\n4. _Differential Equations of Elliptical Polarization._--Although\r\ncircular and elliptical polarization can be clearly conceived, and\r\ntheir existence, it would seem, irresistibly established by the\r\nphenomena, it {123} is extremely difficult to conceive any\r\narrangement of the particles of bodies by which such motions can\r\nmechanically be produced; and this difficulty is the greater,\r\nbecause some fluids and some gases impress a circular polarization\r\nupon light; in which cases we cannot imagine any definite\r\narrangement of the particles, such as might form the mechanism\r\nrequisite for the purpose. Accordingly, it does not appear that any\r\none has been able to suggest even a plausible hypothesis on that\r\nsubject. Yet, even here, something has been done. Professor Mac\r\nCullagh, of Dublin, has discovered that by slightly modifying the\r\n_analytical expressions_ resulting from the common case of the\r\npropagation of light, we may obtain other expressions which would\r\ngive rise to such motions as produce circular and elliptical\r\npolarization. And though we cannot as yet assign the mechanical\r\ninterpretation of the language of analysis thus generalized, this\r\ngeneralization brings together and explains by one common numerical\r\nsupposition, two distinct classes of facts;--a circumstance which,\r\nin all cases, entitles an hypothesis to a very favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Mac Cullagh's assumption consists in adding to the two equations\r\nof motion which are expressed by means of second differentials, two\r\nother terms involving third differentials in a simple and\r\nsymmetrical manner. In doing this, he introduces a coefficient, of\r\nwhich the magnitude determines both the amount of rotation of the\r\npolarization of a ray passing along the axis, as observed and\r\nmeasured by Biot, and the ellipticity of the polarization of a ray\r\nwhich is oblique to the axis, according to Mr. Airy's theory, of\r\nwhich ellipticity that philosopher also had obtained certain\r\nmeasures. The agreement between the two sets of measures[118\\9] thus\r\nbrought into connexion is such as very strikingly to confirm Mr. Mac\r\nCullagh's hypothesis. It appears probable, too, that the\r\nconfirmation of this hypothesis involves, although in an obscure and\r\noracular form, a confirmation of the undulatory theory, which is the\r\nstarting-point of this curious speculation.\r\n\r\n[Note 118\\9: _Royal I. A. Trans._ 1836.]\r\n\r\n5. _Elliptical Polarization of Metals._--The effect of metals upon\r\nthe light which they reflect, was known from the first to be\r\ndifferent from that which transparent bodies produce. Sir David\r\nBrewster, who has recently examined this subject very fully,[119\\9]\r\nhas described the modification thus produced, as _elliptic\r\npolarization_. In employing this term, \"he seems to have been led,\"\r\nit has been observed,[120\\9] \"by a {124} desire to avoid as much as\r\npossible all reference to theory. The laws which he has obtained,\r\nhowever, belong to elliptically-polarized light in the sense in\r\nwhich the term was introduced by Fresnel.\" And the identity of the\r\nlight produced by metallic reflection with the\r\nelliptically-polarized light of the wave-theory, is placed beyond\r\nall doubt, by an observation of Professor Airy, that the rings of\r\nuniaxal crystals, produced by Fresnel's elliptically-polarized\r\nlight, are exactly the same as those produced by Brewster's metallic\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n[Note 119\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1830.]\r\n\r\n[Note 120\\9: Lloyd, _Report on Optics_, p. 372. (Brit. Assoc.)]\r\n\r\n6. _Newton's Rings by Polarized Light._--Other modifications of the\r\nphenomena of thin plates by the use of polarized light, supplied\r\nother striking confirmations of the theory. These were in one case\r\nthe more remarkable, since the result was foreseen by means of a\r\nrigorous application of the conception of the vibratory motion of\r\nlight, and confirmed by experiment. Professor Airy, of Cambridge,\r\nwas led by his reasonings to see, that if Newton's rings are\r\nproduced between a lens and a plate of metal, by polarized light,\r\nthen, up to the polarizing angle, the central spot will be black,\r\nand instantly beyond this, it will be white. In a note,[121\\9] in\r\nwhich he announced this, he says, \"This I anticipated from Fresnel's\r\nexpressions; it is confirmatory of them, and defies emission.\" He\r\nalso predicted that when the rings were produced between two\r\nsubstances of very different refractive powers, the centre would\r\ntwice pass from black to white and from white to black, by\r\nincreasing the angle; which anticipation was fulfilled by using a\r\ndiamond for the higher refraction.[122\\9]\r\n\r\n[Note 121\\9: Addressed to myself, dated May 28, 1831. I ought,\r\nhowever, to notice, that this experiment had been made by M. Arago,\r\nfifteen years earlier, and published: though not then recollected by\r\nMr. Airy.]\r\n\r\n[Note 122\\9: _Camb. Trans._ vol. ii. p. 409.]\r\n\r\n7. _Conical Refraction._--In the same manner. Professor Hamilton of\r\nDublin pointed out that according to the Fresnelian doctrine of double\r\nrefraction, there is a certain direction of a crystal in which a\r\nsingle ray of light will be refracted so as to form a _conical\r\npencil_. For the direction of the refracted ray is determined by a\r\nplane which touches the wave surface, the rule being that the ray must\r\npass from the centre of the surface to the point of contact; and\r\nthough in general this contact gives a single point only, it so\r\nhappens, from the peculiar inflected form of the wave surface, which\r\nhas what is called _a cusp_, that in one particular position, the\r\nplane can touch the surface in an entire circle. Thus the general rule\r\nwhich assigns the path of {125} the refracted ray, would, in this\r\ncase, guide it from the centre of the surface to every point in the\r\ncircumference of the circle, and thus make it a cone. This very\r\ncurious and unexpected result, which Professor Hamilton thus obtained\r\nfrom the theory, his friend Professor Lloyd verified as an\r\nexperimental fact. We may notice, also, that Professor Lloyd found the\r\nlight of the conical pencil to be polarized according to a law of an\r\nunusual kind; but one which was easily seen to be in complete\r\naccordance with the theory.\r\n\r\n8. _Fringes of Shadows._--The phenomena of the _fringes of shadows_\r\nof small holes and groups of holes, which had been the subject of\r\nexperiment by Fraunhofer, were at a later period carefully observed\r\nin a vast variety of cases by M. Schwerd of Spires, and published in\r\na separate work,[123\\9] _Beugungs-erscheinungen_ (Phenomena of\r\nInflection), 1836. In this Treatise, the author has with great\r\nindustry and skill calculated the integrals which, as we have seen,\r\nare requisite in order to trace the consequences of the theory; and\r\nthe accordance which he finds between these and the varied and\r\nbrilliant results of observation is throughout exact. \"I shall,\"\r\nsays he, in the preface,[124\\9] \"prove by the present Treatise, that\r\nall inflection-phenomena, through openings of any form, size, and\r\narrangement, are not only explained by the undulation-theory, but\r\nthat they can be represented by analytical expressions, determining\r\nthe intensity of the light in any point whatever.\" And he justly\r\nadds, that the undulation-theory accounts for the phenomena of\r\nlight, as completely as the theory of gravitation does for the facts\r\nof the solar system.\r\n\r\n[Note 123\\9: _Die Beugungs-erscheinungen, aus dem Fundamental-gesetz\r\nder Undulations-Theorie analytisch entwickelt und in Bildern\r\ndargestellt_, von F. M. Schwerd. Mannheim, 1835.]\r\n\r\n[Note 124\\9: Dated Speyer, Aug. 1835.]\r\n\r\n9. _Objections to the Theory._--We have hitherto mentioned only\r\ncases in which the undulatory theory was either entirely successful\r\nin explaining the facts, or at least hypothetically consistent with\r\nthem and with itself. But other objections were started, and some\r\ndifficulties were long considered as very embarrassing. Objections\r\nwere made to the theory by some English experimenters, as Mr.\r\nPotter, Mr. Barton, and others. These appeared in scientific\r\njournals, and were afterwards answered in similar publications. The\r\nobjections depended partly on the measure of the _intensity_ of\r\nlight in the different points of the phenomena (a datum which it is\r\nvery difficult to obtain with accuracy {126} by experiment), and\r\npartly on misconceptions of the theory; and I believe there are none\r\nof them which would now be insisted on.\r\n\r\nWe may mention, also, another difficulty, which it was the habit of\r\nthe opponents of the theory to urge as a reproach against it, long\r\nafter it had been satisfactorily explained: I mean the\r\n_half-undulation_ which Young and Fresnel had found it necessary, in\r\nsome cases, to assume as gained or lost by one of the rays. Though\r\nthey and their followers could not analyse the mechanism of\r\nreflection with sufficient exactness to trace out all the\r\ncircumstances, it was not difficult to see, upon Fresnel's\r\nprinciples, that reflection from the interior and exterior surface\r\nof glass must be of opposite kinds, which might be expressed by\r\nsupposing one of these rays to lose half an undulation. And thus\r\nthere came into view a justification of the step which had\r\noriginally been taken upon empirical grounds alone.\r\n\r\n10. _Dispersion, on the Undulatory Theory._--A difficulty of another\r\nkind occasioned a more serious and protracted embarrassment to the\r\ncultivators of this theory. This was the apparent impossibility of\r\naccounting, on the theory, for the prismatic dispersion of color.\r\nFor it had been shown by Newton that the amount of refraction is\r\ndifferent for every color; and the amount of refraction depends on\r\nthe velocity with which light is propagated. Yet the theory\r\nsuggested no reason why the velocity should be different for\r\ndifferent colors: for, by mathematical calculation, vibrations of\r\nall degrees of rapidity (in which alone colors differ) are\r\npropagated with the same speed. Nor does analogy lead us to expect\r\nthis variety. There is no such difference between quick and slow\r\nwaves of air. The sounds of the deepest and the highest bells of a\r\npeal are heard at any distance in the same order. Here, therefore,\r\nthe theory was at fault.\r\n\r\nBut this defect was far from being a fatal one. For though the\r\ntheory did not explain, it did not contradict, dispersion. The\r\nsuppositions on which the calculations had been conducted, and the\r\nanalogy of sound, were obviously in no small degree precarious. The\r\nvelocity of propagation might differ for different rates of\r\nundulation, in virtue of many causes which would not affect the\r\ngeneral theoretical results.\r\n\r\nMany such hypothetical causes were suggested by various eminent\r\nmathematicians, as solutions of this conspicuous difficulty. But\r\nwithout dwelling upon these conjectures, it may suffice to notice\r\nthat hypothesis upon which the attention of mathematicians was soon\r\nconcentrated. This was the _hypothesis of finite intervals_ between\r\nthe {127} particles of the ether. The length of one of those\r\nundulations which produce light, is a very small quantity, its mean\r\nvalue being 1⁄50,000th of an inch; but in the previous\r\ninvestigations of the consequences of the theory, it had been\r\nassumed that the distance from each other, of the particles of the\r\nether, which, by their attractions or repulsions, caused the\r\nundulations to be propagated, is indefinitely less than this small\r\nquantity;--so that its amount might be neglected in the cases in\r\nwhich the length of the undulation was one of the quantities which\r\ndetermined the result. But this assumption was made arbitrarily, as\r\na step of simplification, and because it was imagined that, in this\r\nway, a nearer approach was made to the case of a continuous fluid\r\nether, which the supposition of distinct particles imperfectly\r\nrepresented. It was still free for mathematicians to proceed upon\r\nthe opposite assumption, of particles of which the distances were\r\nfinite, either as a mathematical basis of calculation, or as a\r\nphysical hypothesis; and it remained to be seen if, when this was\r\ndone, the velocity of light would still be the same for different\r\nlengths of undulation, that is, for different colors. M. Cauchy,\r\ncalculating, upon the most general principles, the motion of such a\r\ncollection of particles as would form an elastic medium, obtained\r\nresults which included the new extension of the previous hypothesis.\r\nProfessor Powell, of Oxford, applied himself to reduce to\r\ncalculation, and to compare with experiment, the result of these\r\nresearches. And it appeared that, on M. Cauchy's principles, a\r\nvariation in the velocity of light is produced by a variation in the\r\nlength of the wave, provided that the interval between the molecules\r\nof the ether bears a sensible ratio to the length of an\r\nundulation.[125\\9] Professor Powell obtained also, from the general\r\nexpressions, a formula expressing the relation between the\r\nrefractive index of a ray, and the length of a wave, or the color of\r\nlight.[126\\9] It then became his task to ascertain whether this\r\nrelation obtained experimentally; and he found a very close\r\nagreement between the numbers which resulted from the formula and\r\nthose observed by Fraunhofer, for ten different kinds of media,\r\nnamely, certain glasses and fluids.[127\\9] To these he afterwards\r\nadded ten other cases of crystals observed by M. Rudberg.[128\\9] Mr.\r\nKelland, of Cambridge, also calculated, in a manner somewhat\r\ndifferent, the results of the same hypothesis of finite\r\nintervals;[129\\9] and, obtaining {128} formulæ not exactly the same\r\nas Professor Powell, found also an agreement between these and\r\nFraunhofer's observations.\r\n\r\n[Note 125\\9: _Phil. Mag._ vol. vi. p. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Note 126\\9: Ib. vol. vii. 1835, p. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Note 127\\9: _Phil. Trans._ 1835, p. 249.]\r\n\r\n[Note 128\\9: Ib. 1836, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Note 129\\9: _Camb. Trans._ vol.  vi. p. 153.]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, that the refractive indices observed and\r\nemployed in these comparisons, were not those determined by the\r\ncolor of the ray, which is not capable of exact identification, but\r\nthose more accurate measures which Fraunhofer was enabled to make,\r\nin consequence of having detected in the spectrum the black lines\r\nwhich he called B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The agreement between the\r\ntheoretical formulæ and the observed numbers is remarkable,\r\nthroughout all the series of comparisons of which we have spoken.\r\nYet we must at present hesitate to pronounce upon the hypothesis of\r\nfinite intervals, as proved by these calculations; for though this\r\nhypothesis has given results agreeing so closely with experiment, it\r\nis not yet clear that other hypotheses may not produce an equal\r\nagreement. By the nature of the case, there must be a certain\r\ngradation and continuity in the succession of colors in the\r\nspectrum, and hence, any supposition which will account for the\r\ngeneral fact of the whole dispersion, may possibly account for the\r\namount of the intermediate dispersions, because these must be\r\ninterpolations between the extremes. The result of this hypothetical\r\ncalculation, however, shows very satisfactorily that there is not,\r\nin the fact of dispersion, anything which is at all formidable to\r\nthe undulatory theory.\r\n\r\n11. _Conclusion._--There are several other of the more recondite\r\npoints of the theory which may be considered as, at present, too\r\nundecided to allow us to speak historically of the discussions which\r\nthey have occasioned.[130\\9] For example, it was conceived, for some\r\ntime, that the vibrations of polarized light are perpendicular to\r\nthe plane of polarization. But this assumption was not an essential\r\npart of the theory; and all the phenomena would equally allow us to\r\nsuppose the vibrations to be in the polarization plane; the main\r\nrequisite being, that light polarized in planes at right angles to\r\neach other, should also have the vibrations at right angles.\r\nAccordingly, for some time, this point was left undecided by Young\r\nand Fresnel, and, more recently, some mathematicians have come to\r\nthe opinion that ether vibrates in the plane of polarization. The\r\ntheory of transverse vibrations is equally stable, whichever\r\nsupposition may be finally confirmed.\r\n\r\n[Note 130\\9:  For on account of these, see Professor Lloyd's _Report\r\non Physical Optics_. (Brit. Assoc. Report, 1834.)]\r\n\r\nWe may speak, in the same manner, of the suppositions which, from\r\n{129} the time of Young and Fresnel, the cultivators of this theory\r\nhave been led to make respecting the mechanical constitution of the\r\nether, and the forces by which transverse vibrations are produced.\r\nIt was natural that various difficulties should arise upon such\r\npoints, for transverse vibrations had not previously been made the\r\nsubject of mechanical calculation, and the forces which occasion\r\nthem must act in a different manner from those which were previously\r\ncontemplated. Still, we may venture to say, without entering into\r\nthese discussions, that it has appeared, from all the mathematical\r\nreasonings which have been pursued, that there is not, in the\r\nconception of transverse vibrations, anything inconsistent either\r\nwith the principles of mechanics, or with the best general views\r\nwhich we can form, of the forces by which the universe is held\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI willingly speak as briefly as the nature of my undertaking allows,\r\nof those points of the undulatory theory which are still under\r\ndeliberation among mathematicians. With respect to these, an\r\nintimate acquaintance with mathematics and physics is necessary to\r\nenable any one to understand the steps which are made from day to\r\nday; and still higher philosophical qualifications would be\r\nrequisite in order to pronounce a judgment upon them. I shall,\r\ntherefore, conclude this survey by remarking the highly promising\r\ncondition of this great department of science, in respect to the\r\ncharacter of its cultivators. Nothing less than profound thought and\r\ngreat mathematical skill can enable any one to deal with this\r\ntheory, in any way likely to promote the interests of science. But\r\nthere appears, in the horizon of the scientific world, a\r\nconsiderable class of young mathematicians, who are already bringing\r\nto these investigations the requisite talents and zeal; and who,\r\nhaving acquired their knowledge of the theory since the time when\r\nits acceptation was doubtful, possess, without effort, that\r\nsingleness and decision of view as to its fundamental doctrines,\r\nwhich it is difficult for those to attain whose minds have had to go\r\nthrough the hesitation, struggle, and balance of the epoch of the\r\nestablishment of the theory. In the hands of this new generation, it\r\nis reasonable to suppose the Analytical Mechanics of light will be\r\nimproved as much as the Analytical Mechanics of the solar system was\r\nby the successors of Newton. We have already had to notice many of\r\nthis younger race of undulationists. For besides MM. Cauchy,\r\nPoisson, and Ampère, M. Lamé has been more recently following these\r\nresearches in France.[131\\9] In {130} Belgium, M. Quetelet has given\r\ngreat attention to them; and, in our own country, Sir William\r\nHamilton, and Professor Lloyd, of Dublin, have been followed by Mr.\r\nMac Cullagh. Professor Powell, of Oxford, has continued his\r\nresearches with unremitting industry; and, at Cambridge, Professor\r\nAiry, who did much for the establishment and diffusion of the theory\r\nbefore he was removed to the post of Astronomer Royal, at Greenwich,\r\nhas had the satisfaction to see his labors continued by others, even\r\nto the most recent time; for Mr. Kelland,[132\\9] whom we have\r\nalready mentioned, and Mr. Archibald Smith,[133\\9] the two persons\r\nwho, in 1834 and 1836, received the highest mathematical honors\r\nwhich that university can bestow, have both of them published\r\ninvestigations respecting the undulatory theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 131\\9: Prof. Lloyd's _Report_, p. 392.]\r\n\r\n[Note 132\\9: _On the Dispersion of Light, as explained by the\r\nHypothesis of Finite Intervals._ Camb. Trans. vol. vi. p. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Note 133\\9: _Investigation of the Equation to Fresnel's Wave\r\nSurface_, ib. p. 85. See also, in the same volume, _Mathematical\r\nConsiderations on the Problem of the Rainbow_, showing it to belong\r\nto Physical Optics, by R. Potter, Esq., of Queen's College.]\r\n\r\nWe may be permitted to add, as a reflection obviously suggested by\r\nthese facts, that the cause of the progress of science is\r\nincalculably benefited by the existence of a body of men, trained\r\nand stimulated to the study of the higher mathematics, such as exist\r\nin the British universities, who are thus prepared, when an abstruse\r\nand sublime theory comes before the world with all the characters of\r\ntruth, to appreciate its evidence, to take steady hold of its\r\nprinciples, to pursue its calculations, and thus to convert into a\r\nportion of the permanent treasure and inheritance of the civilized\r\nworld, discoveries which might otherwise expire with the great\r\ngeniuses who produced them, and be lost for ages, as, in former\r\ntimes, great scientific discoveries have sometimes been.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is acquainted with the history of recent optical\r\ndiscovery, will see that we have omitted much which has justly\r\nexcited admiration; as, for example, the phenomena produced by glass\r\nunder heat or pressure, noticed by MM. Lobeck, and Biot, and\r\nBrewster, and many most curious properties of particular minerals.\r\nWe have omitted, too, all notice of the phenomena and laws of the\r\nabsorption of light, which hitherto stand unconnected with the\r\ntheory. But in this we have not materially deviated from our main\r\ndesign; for our end, in what we have done, has been to trace the\r\nadvances of Optics {131} towards perfection as a theory; and this\r\ntask we have now nearly executed as far as our abilities allow.\r\n\r\nWe have been desirous of showing that the _type_ of this progress,\r\nin the histories of the two great sciences, Physical Astronomy and\r\nPhysical Optics, is the same. In both we have many _Laws of\r\nPhenomena_ detected and accumulated by acute and inventive men; we\r\nhave _Preludial_ guesses which touch the true theory, but which\r\nremain for a time imperfect, undeveloped, unconfirmed: finally we\r\nhave the _Epoch_ when this true theory, clearly apprehended by great\r\nphilosophical geniuses, is recommended by its fully explaining what\r\nit was first meant to explain, and confirmed by its explaining what\r\nit was not meant to explain. We have then its _Progress_ struggling\r\nfor a little while with adverse prepossessions and difficulties;\r\nfinally overcoming all these, and moving onwards, while its\r\ntriumphal procession is joined by all the younger and more vigorous\r\nmen of science.\r\n\r\nIt would, perhaps, be too fanciful to attempt to establish a\r\nparallelism between the prominent persons who figure in these two\r\nhistories. If we were to do this, we must consider Huyghens and\r\nHooke as standing in the place of Copernicus, since, like him, they\r\nannounced the true theory, but left it to a future age to give it\r\ndevelopment and mechanical confirmation; Malus and Brewster,\r\ngrouping them together, correspond to Tycho Brahe and Kepler,\r\nlaborious in accumulating observations, inventive and happy in\r\ndiscovering laws of phenomena; and Young and Fresnel combined, make\r\nup the Newton of optical science.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [In the _Report on Physical Optics_, (_Brit. Ass.\r\nReports_, 1834,) by Prof. Lloyd, the progress of the mathematical\r\ntheory after Fresnel's labors is stated more distinctly than I have\r\nstated it, to the following effect. Ampère, in 1828, proved\r\nFresnel's mathematical results directly, which Fresnel had only\r\nproved indirectly, and derived from his proof Fresnel's beautiful\r\ngeometrical construction. Prof. Mac Cullagh not long after gave a\r\nconcise demonstration of the same theorem, and of the other\r\nprincipal points of Fresnel's theory. He represents the elastic\r\nforce by means of an ellipsoid whose axes are inversely proportional\r\nto those of Fresnel's generating ellipsoid, and deduces Fresnel's\r\nconstruction geometrically. In the third Supplement to his _Essay on\r\nthe Theory of Systems of Rays_ (_Trans. R. I. Acad._ vol. xvii.),\r\nSir W. Hamilton has presented that portion of Fresnel's theory which\r\nrelates to the fundamental problem of the determination of the\r\nvelocity and polarization of a plane wave, in a very elegant and\r\nanalytical form. This he does by means of what he calls the {132}\r\n_characteristic function_ of the optical system to which the problem\r\nbelongs. From this function is deduced the _surface of\r\nwave-slowness_ of the medium; and by means of this surface, the\r\ndirection of the rays refracted into the medium. From this\r\nconstruction also Sir W. Hamilton was led to the anticipation of\r\n_conical refraction_, mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of MM. Cauchy and Lamé refer to the laws by which\r\nthe particles of the ether act upon each other and upon the\r\nparticles of other bodies;--a field of speculation which appears to\r\nme not yet ripe for the final operations of the analyst.\r\n\r\nAmong the mathematicians who have supplied defects in Fresnel's\r\nreasoning on this subject, I may mention Mr. Tovey, who treated it\r\nin several papers in the _Philosophical Magazine_ (1837-40). Mr.\r\nTovey's early death must be deemed a loss to mathematical science.\r\n\r\nBesides investigating the motion of symmetrical systems of particles\r\nwhich may be supposed to correspond to biaxal crystals, Mr. Tovey\r\nconsidered the case of unsymmetrical systems, and found that the\r\nundulations propagated would, in the general case, be elliptical;\r\nand that in a particular case, circular undulations would take\r\nplace, such as are propagated along the axis of quartz. It appears\r\nto me, however, that he has not given a definite meaning to those\r\nlimitations of his general hypothesis which conduct him to this\r\nresult. Perhaps if the hypothetical conditions of this result were\r\ntraced into detail, they would be found to reside in a _screw-like_\r\narrangement of the elementary particles, in some degree such as\r\ncrystals of quartz themselves exhibit in their forms, when they have\r\nplagihedral faces at both ends.\r\n\r\nSuch crystals of quartz are, some like a right-handed and some like\r\na left-handed screw; and, as Sir John Herschel discovered, the\r\ncircular polarization is right-handed or left-handed according as\r\nthe plagihedral form is so. In Mr. Tovey's hypothetical\r\ninvestigation it does not appear upon what part of the hypothesis\r\nthis difference of right and left-handed depends. The definition of\r\nthis part of the hypothesis is a very desirable step.\r\n\r\nWhen crystals of Quartz are right-handed at one end, they are\r\nright-handed at the other end: but there is a different kind of\r\nplagihedral form, which occurs in some other crystals, for instance,\r\nin Apatite: in these the plagihedral faces are right-handed at the\r\none extremity and left-handed at the other. For the sake of\r\ndistinction, we may call the former _homologous_ plagihedral faces,\r\nsince, at both ends, they have the same name; and the latter\r\n_heterologous_ plagihedral faces. {133}\r\n\r\nThe homologous plagihedral faces of Quartz crystals are accompanied\r\nby homologous circular polarization of the same name. I do not know\r\nthat heterologous circular polarization has been observed in any\r\ncrystal, but it has been discovered by Dr. Faraday to occur in\r\nglass, &c., when subjected to powerful magnetic action.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was presumptuous in me to attempt to draw such\r\ncomparisons, especially with regard to living persons, as I have\r\ndone in the preceding pages of this Book. Having published this\r\npassage, however, I shall not now suppress it. But I may observe\r\nthat the immense number and variety of the beautiful optical\r\ndiscoveries which we owe to Sir David Brewster makes the comparison\r\nin his case a very imperfect representation of his triumphs over\r\nnature; and that, besides his place in the history of the Theory of\r\nOptics, he must hold a most eminent position in the history of\r\nOptical Crystallography, whenever the discovery of a True Optical\r\nTheory of Crystals supplies us with the _Epoch_ to which his labors\r\nin this field form so rich a _Prelude_. I cordially assent to the\r\nexpression employed by Mr. Airy in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1840, in\r\nwhich he speaks of Sir David Brewster as \"the Father of Modern\r\nExperimental Optics.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{135}}\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\n_SECONDARY MECHANICAL SCIENCES._\r\n(CONTINUED.)\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF\r\nTHERMOTICS AND ATMOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Et primum faciunt ignem se vortere in auras\r\n  Aëris; hinc imbrem gigni terramque creari\r\n  Ex imbri; retroque a terrâ cuncta revorti,\r\n  Humorem primum, post aëra deinde calorem;\r\n  Nec cessare hæc inter se mutare, meare,\r\n  De cœlo ad terram de terrâ ad sidera mundi.\r\n          LUCRETIUS, i. 783.\r\n\r\n  Water, and Air, and Fire, alternate run\r\n  Their endless circle, multiform, yet one.\r\n  For, moulded by the fervor's latent beams,\r\n  Solids flow loose, and fluids flash to steams,\r\n  And elemental flame, with secret force,\r\n  Pursues through earth, air, sky, its stated course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{137}}\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n_Of Thermotics and Atmology._\r\n\r\n\r\nI EMPLOY the term _Thermotics_ to include all the doctrines\r\nrespecting Heat, which have hitherto been established on proper\r\nscientific grounds. Our survey of the history of this branch of\r\nscience must be more rapid and less detailed than it has been in\r\nthose subjects of which we have hitherto treated: for our knowledge\r\nis, in this case, more vague and uncertain than in the others, and\r\nhas made less progress towards a general and certain theory. Still,\r\nthe narrative is too important and too instructive to be passed over.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of Formal Thermotics and Physical Thermotics,--of\r\nthe discovery of the mere Laws of Phenomena, and the discovery of\r\ntheir causes,--is applicable here, as in other departments of our\r\nknowledge. But we cannot exhibit, in any prominent manner, the\r\nlatter division of the science now before us; since no general\r\ntheory of heat has yet been propounded, which affords the means of\r\ncalculating the circumstances of the phenomena of conduction,\r\nradiation, expansion, and change of solid, liquid, and gaseous form.\r\nStill, on each of these subjects there have been proposed, and\r\nextensively assented to, certain general views, each of which\r\nexplains its appropriate class of phenomena; and, in some cases,\r\nthese principles have been clothed in precise and mathematical\r\nconditions, and thus made bases of calculation.\r\n\r\nThese principles, thus possessing a generality of a limited kind,\r\nconnecting several observed laws of phenomena, but yet not\r\nconnecting all the observed classes of facts which relate to heat,\r\nwill require our separate attention. They may be described as the\r\nDoctrine of Conduction, the Doctrine of Radiation, the Doctrine of\r\nSpecific Heat, and the Doctrine of Latent Heat; and these, and\r\nsimilar doctrines respecting heat, make up the science which we may\r\ncall _Thermotics proper_.\r\n\r\nBut besides these collections of principles which regard heat by\r\nitself, the relations of heat and moisture give rise to another and\r\nimportant collection of laws and principles, which I shall treat of\r\nin connexion with Thermotics, and shall term _Atmology_, borrowing\r\n{138} the term from the Greek word (ἄτμος,) which signifies _vapor_.\r\nThe _Atmosphere_ was so named by the Greeks, as being a sphere of\r\nvapor; and, undoubtedly, the most general and important of the\r\nphenomena which take place in the air, by which the earth is\r\nsurrounded, are those in which water, of one _consistence_ or other\r\n(ice, water, or steam,) is concerned. The knowledge which relates to\r\nwhat takes place in the atmosphere has been called _Meteorology_, in\r\nits collective form: but such knowledge is, in fact, composed of\r\nparts of many different sciences. And it is useful for our purpose\r\nto consider separately those portions of Meteorology which have\r\nreference to the laws of aqueous vapor, and these we may include\r\nunder the term Atmology.\r\n\r\nThe instruments which have been invented for the purpose of\r\nmeasuring the moisture of the air, that is, the quantity of vapor\r\nwhich exists in it, have been termed _Hygrometers_; and the\r\ndoctrines on which these instruments depend, and to which they lead,\r\nhave been called _Hygrometry_; but this term has not been used in\r\nquite so extensive a sense as that which we intend to affix to\r\n_Atmology_.\r\n\r\nIn treating of Thermotics, we shall first describe the earlier\r\nprogress of men's views concerning Conduction, Radiation, and the\r\nlike, and shall then speak of the more recent corrections and\r\nextensions, by which they have been brought nearer to theoretical\r\ngenerality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{139}}\r\nTHERMOTICS PROPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTRINES OF CONDUCTION AND RADIATION.\r\n\r\n_Section_ 1.--_Introduction of the Doctrine of Conduction._\r\n\r\n\r\nBY _conduction_ is meant the propagation of heat from one part to\r\nanother of a continuous body; or from one body to another in contact\r\nwith it; as when one end of a poker stuck in the fire heats the\r\nother end, or when this end heats the hand which takes hold of it.\r\nBy _radiation_ is meant the diffusion of heat from the surface of a\r\nbody to points not in contact. It is clear in both these cases,\r\nthat, in proportion as the hot portion is hotter, it produces a\r\ngreater effect in warming the cooler portion; that is, it\r\n_communicates more Heat_ to it, if _Heat_ be the abstract conception\r\nof which this effect is the measure. The simplest rule which can be\r\nproposed is, that the heat thus communicated in a given instant is\r\nproportional to the excess of the heat of the hot body over that of\r\nthe contiguous bodies; there are no obvious phenomena which\r\ncontradict the supposition that this is the true law; and it was\r\nthence assumed by Newton as the true law for radiation and by other\r\nwriters for conduction. This assumption was confirmed approximately,\r\nand afterwards corrected, for the case of Radiation; in its\r\napplication to Conduction, it has been made the basis of calculation\r\nup to the present time. We may observe that this statement takes for\r\ngranted that we have attained to a measure of heat (or of\r\n_temperature_, as heat thus measured is termed), corresponding to\r\nthe law thus assumed; and, in fact, as we shall have occasion to\r\nexplain in speaking of the _measures_ of sensible qualities, {140}\r\nthe thermometrical scale of heat according to the expansion of\r\nliquids (which is the measure of temperature here adopted), was\r\nconstructed with a reference to Newton's law of radiation of heat;\r\nand thus the law is necessarily consistent with the scale.\r\n\r\nIn any case in which the parts of a body are unequally hot, the\r\ntemperature will vary _continuously_ in passing from one part of the\r\nbody to another; thus, a long bar of iron, of which one end is kept\r\nred hot, will exhibit a gradual diminution of temperature at\r\nsuccessive points, proceeding to the other end. The law of\r\ntemperature of the parts of such a bar might be expressed by the\r\nordinates of a _curve_ which should run alongside the bar. And, in\r\norder to trace mathematically the consequences of the assumed law,\r\nsome of those processes would be necessary, by which mathematicians\r\nare enabled to deal with the properties of curves; as the method of\r\ninfinitesimals, or the differential calculus; and the truth or\r\nfalsehood of the law would be determined, according to the usual\r\nrules of inductive science, by a comparison of results so deduced\r\nfrom the principle, with the observed phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt was easily perceived that this comparison was the task which\r\nphysical inquirers had to perform; but the execution of it was\r\ndelayed for some time; partly, perhaps, because the mathematical\r\nprocess presented some difficulties. Even in a case so simple as\r\nthat above mentioned, of a linear bar with a stationary temperature\r\nat one end, _partial differentials_ entered; for there were three\r\nvariable quantities, the time, as well as the place of each point\r\nand its temperature. And at first, another scruple occurred to M.\r\nBiot when, about 1804, he undertook this problem.[1\\10] \"A\r\ndifficulty,\" says Laplace,[2\\10] in 1809, \"presents itself, which\r\nhas not yet been solved. The quantities of heat received and\r\ncommunicated in an instant (by any point of the bar) must be\r\ninfinitely small quantities of the same order as the excess of the\r\nheat of a slice of the body over that of the contiguous slice;\r\ntherefore the _excess_ of the heat received by any slice over the\r\nheat communicated, is an infinitely small quantity of the second\r\norder; and the accumulation in a finite time (which depends on this\r\nexcess) cannot be finite.\" I conceive that this difficulty arises\r\nentirely from an arbitrary and unnecessary assumption concerning the\r\nrelation of the infinitesimal parts of the body. Laplace resolved\r\nthe difficulty by further reasoning founded upon the same assumption\r\nwhich occasioned {141} it; but Fourier, who was the most\r\ndistinguished of the cultivators of this mathematical doctrine of\r\nconduction, follows a course of reasoning in which the difficulty\r\ndoes not present itself. Indeed it is stated by Laplace, in the\r\nMemoir above quoted,[3\\10] that Fourier had already obtained the\r\ntrue fundamental equations by views of his own.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\10: Biot, _Traité de Phys._ iv. p. 669.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\10: Laplace, _Mém. Inst._ for 1809, p. 332.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\10: Laplace, _Mém. Inst._ for 1809, p. 538.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of the history of the doctrine of conduction is\r\nprincipally the history of Fourier's labors. Attention having been\r\ndrawn to the subject, as we have mentioned, the French Institute, in\r\nJanuary, 1810, proposed, as their prize question, \"To give the\r\nmathematical theory of the laws of the propagation of heat, and to\r\ncompare this theory with exact observations.\" Fourier's Memoir (the\r\nsequel of one delivered in 1807,) was sent in September, 1811; and\r\nthe prize (3000 francs) adjudged to it in 1812. In consequence of\r\nthe political confusion which prevailed in France, or of other\r\ncauses, these important Memoirs were not published by the Academy\r\ntill 1824; but extracts had been printed in the _Bulletin des\r\nSciences_ in 1808, and in the _Annales de Chimie_ in 1816; and\r\nPoisson and M. Cauchy had consulted the manuscript itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to give, in this place,[4\\10] an account of the\r\nanalytical processes by which Fourier obtained his results. The\r\nskill displayed in these Memoirs is such as to make them an object\r\nof just admiration to mathematicians; but they consist entirely of\r\ndeductions from the fundamental principle which I have\r\nnoticed,--that the quantity of heat conducted from a hotter to a\r\ncolder point is proportional to the excess of heat, modified by the\r\n_conductivity_, or conducting power of each substance. The equations\r\nwhich flow from this principle assume nearly the same forms as those\r\nwhich occur in the most general problems of hydrodynamics. Besides\r\nFourier's solution, Laplace, Poisson, and M. Cauchy have also\r\nexercised their great analytical skill in the management of these\r\nformulæ. We shall briefly speak of the comparison of the results of\r\nthese reasonings with experiment, and notice some other consequences\r\nto which they lead. But before we can do this, we must pay some\r\nattention to the subject of radiation. {142}\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\10: I have given an account of Fourier's mathematical\r\nresults in the _Reports of the British Association_ for 1835.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Introduction of the Doctrine of Radiation._\r\n\r\nA HOT body, as a mass of incandescent iron, emits heat, as we\r\nperceive by our senses when we approach it; and by this emission of\r\nheat the hot body cools down. The first step in our systematic\r\nknowledge of the subject was made in the _Principia_. \"It was in the\r\ndestiny of that great work,\" says Fourier, \"to exhibit, or at least\r\nto indicate, the causes of the principal phenomena of the universe.\"\r\nNewton assumed, as we have already said, that the rate at which a\r\nbody cools, that is, parts with its heat to surrounding bodies, is\r\nproportional to its heat; and on this assumption he rested the\r\nverification of his scale of temperatures. It is an easy deduction\r\nfrom this law, that if times of cooling be taken in arithmetical\r\nprogression, the heat will decrease in geometrical progression.\r\nKraft, and after him Richman, tried to verify this law by direct\r\nexperiments on the cooling of vessels of warm water; and from these\r\nexperiments, which have since been repeated by others, it appears\r\nthat for differences of temperature which do not exceed 50 degrees\r\n(boiling water being 100), this geometrical progression represents,\r\nwith tolerable (but not with complete) accuracy, the process of\r\ncooling.\r\n\r\nThis principle of radiation, like that of conduction, required to be\r\nfollowed out by mathematical reasoning. But it required also to be\r\ncorrected in the first place, for it was easily seen that the rate\r\nof cooling depended, not on the absolute temperature of the body,\r\nbut on the excess of its temperature above the surrounding objects\r\nto which it communicated its heat in cooling. And philosophers were\r\nnaturally led to endeavor to explain or illustrate this process by\r\nsome physical notions. Lambert in 1765 published[5\\10] an _Essay on\r\nthe Force of Heat_, in which he assimilates the communication of\r\nheat to the flow of a fluid out of one vessel into another by an\r\nexcess of pressure; and mathematically deduces the laws of the\r\nprocess on this ground. But some additional facts suggested a\r\ndifferent view of the subject. It was found that heat is propagated\r\nby radiation according to straight lines, like light; and that it\r\nis, as light is, capable of being reflected by mirrors, and thus\r\nbrought to a focus of intenser action. In this manner the radiative\r\neffect of a body could be more precisely traced. A fact, however,\r\ncame under notice, which, at first sight, appeared to {143} offer\r\nsome difficulty. It appeared that cold was reflected no less than\r\nheat. A mass of ice, when its effect was concentrated on a\r\nthermometer by a system of mirrors, made the thermometer fall, just\r\nas a vessel of hot water placed in a similar situation made it rise.\r\nWas cold, then, to be supposed a real substance, no less than heat?\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\10: _Act. Helvet._ tom. ii. p. 172.]\r\n\r\nThe solution of this and similar difficulties was given by Pierre\r\nPrevost, professor at Geneva, whose theory of radiant heat was\r\nproposed about 1790. According to this theory, heat, or _caloric_,\r\nis constantly radiating from every point of the surface of all\r\nbodies in straight lines; and it radiates the more copiously, the\r\ngreater is the quantity of heat which the body contains. Hence a\r\nconstant exchange of heat is going on among neighboring bodies; and\r\na body grows hotter or colder, according as it receives more caloric\r\nthan it emits, or the contrary. And thus a body is cooled by\r\nrectilinear rays from a cold body, because along these paths it\r\nsends rays of heat in greater abundance than those which return the\r\nsame way. This _theory of exchanges_ is simple and satisfactory, and\r\nwas soon generally adopted; but we must consider it rather as the\r\nsimplest mode of expressing the dependence of the communication of\r\nheat on the excess of temperature, than as a proposition of which\r\nthe physical truth is clearly established.\r\n\r\nA number of curious researches on the effect of the different kinds\r\nof surface of the heating and of the heated body, were made by\r\nLeslie and others. On these I shall not dwell; only observing that\r\nthe relative amount of this radiative and receptive energy may be\r\nexpressed by numbers, for each kind of surface; and that we shall\r\nhave occasion to speak of it under the term _exterior conductivity_;\r\nit is thus distinguished from _interior conductivity_, which is the\r\nrelative rate at which heat is conducted in the interior of\r\nbodies.[6\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\10: The term employed by Fourier, _conductibility_ or\r\n_conducibility_, suggests expressions altogether absurd, as if the\r\nbodies could be called _conductible_, or _conducible_, with respect\r\nto heat: I have therefore ventured upon a slight alteration of the\r\nword, and have used the abstract term which analogy would suggest,\r\nif we suppose bodies to be _conductive_ in this respect.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Verifications of the Doctrines of Conduction and\r\nRadiation._\r\n\r\nTHE interior and exterior conductivity of bodies are numbers, which\r\nenter as elements, or _coefficients_, into the mathematical\r\ncalculations founded on the doctrines of conduction and radiation.\r\nThese {144} coefficients are to be determined for each case by\r\nappropriate experiments: when the experimenters had obtained these\r\ndata, as well as the mathematical solutions of the problems, they\r\ncould test the truth of their fundamental principles by a comparison\r\nof the theoretical and actual results in properly-selected cases.\r\nThis was done for the law of conduction in the simple cases of\r\nmetallic bars heated at one end, by M. Biot,[7\\10] and the\r\naccordance with experiment was sufficiently close. In the more\r\ncomplex cases of conduction which Fourier considered, it was less\r\neasy to devise a satisfactory mode of comparison. But some rather\r\ncurious relations which he demonstrated to exist among the\r\ntemperatures at different points of an _armille_, or ring, afforded\r\na good criterion of the value of the calculations, and confirmed\r\ntheir correctness.[8\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\10: _Tr. de Phys._ iv. 671.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\10: _Mém. Inst._ 1819, p. 192, published 1824.]\r\n\r\nWe may therefore presume these doctrines of radiation and conduction\r\nto be sufficiently established; and we may consider their\r\napplication to any remarkable case to be a portion of the history of\r\nscience. We proceed to some such applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_The Geological and Cosmological Application of\r\nThermotics._\r\n\r\nBY far the most important case to which conclusions from these\r\ndoctrines have been applied, is that of the globe of the earth, and\r\nof those laws of climate to which the modifications of temperature\r\ngive rise; and in this way we are led to inferences concerning other\r\nparts of the universe. If we had any means of observing these\r\nterrestrial and cosmical phenomena to a sufficient extent, they\r\nwould be valuable facts on which we might erect our theories; and\r\nthey would thus form part, not of the corollaries, but of the\r\nfoundations of our doctrine of heat. In such a case, the laws of the\r\npropagation of heat, as discovered from experiments on smaller\r\nbodies, would serve to explain these phenomena of the universe, just\r\nas the laws of motion explain the celestial movements. But since we\r\nare almost entirely without any definite indications of the\r\ncondition of the other bodies in the solar system as to heat; and\r\nsince, even with regard to the earth, we know only the temperature\r\nof the parts at or very near the surface, our knowledge of the part\r\nwhich heat plays in the earth and the heavens must be in a great\r\nmeasure, not a generalization of observed facts, but a deduction\r\nfrom theoretical principles. Still, such knowledge, whether obtained\r\n{145} from observation or from theory, must possess great interest\r\nand importance. The doctrines of this kind which we have to notice\r\nrefer principally to the effect of the sun's heat on the earth, the\r\nlaws of climate,--the thermotical condition of the interior of the\r\nearth,--and that of the planetary spaces.\r\n\r\n1. _Effect of Solar Heat on the Earth._--That the sun's heat passes\r\ninto the interior of the earth in a variable manner, depending upon\r\nthe succession of days and nights, summers and winters, is an\r\nobvious consequence of our first notions on this subject. The mode\r\nin which it proceeds into the interior, after descending below the\r\nsurface, remained to be gathered, either from the phenomena, or from\r\nreasoning. Both methods were employed.[9\\10] Saussure endeavored to\r\ntrace its course by digging, in 1785, and thus found that at the\r\ndepth of about thirty-one feet, the annual variation of temperature\r\nis about 1⁄12th what it is at the surface. Leslie adopted a better\r\nmethod, sinking the bulbs of thermometers deep in the earth, while\r\ntheir stems appeared above the surface. In 1813, '16, and '17, he\r\nobserved thus the temperatures at the depths of one, two, four, and\r\neight feet, at Abbotshall, in Fifeshire. The results showed that the\r\nextreme annual oscillations of the temperature diminish as we\r\ndescend. At the depth of one foot, the yearly range of oscillation\r\nwas twenty-five degrees (Fahrenheit); at two feet it was twenty\r\ndegrees; at four feet it was fifteen degrees; at eight feet it was\r\nonly nine degrees and a half. And the time at which the heat was\r\ngreatest was later and later in proceeding to the lower points. At\r\none foot, the maximum and minimum were three weeks after the\r\nsolstice of summer and of winter; at two feet, they were four or\r\nfive weeks; at four feet, they were two months; and at eight feet,\r\nthree months. The mean temperature of all the thermometers was\r\nnearly the same. Similar results were obtained by Ott at Zurich in\r\n1762, and by Herrenschneider at Strasburg in 1821, '2, '3.[10\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\10: Leslie, art. _Climate_, Supp. _Enc. Brit._ 179.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\10: Pouillet, _Météorol._ t. ii. p. 643.]\r\n\r\nThese results had already been explained by Fourier's theory of\r\nconduction. He had shown[11\\10] that when the surface of a sphere is\r\naffected by a periodical heat, certain alternations of heat travel\r\nuniformly into the interior, but that the extent of the alternation\r\ndiminishes in geometrical progression in this descent. This\r\nconclusion applies to the effect of days and years on the\r\ntemperature of the earth, and shows that such facts as those\r\nobserved by Leslie are both exemplifications of {146} the general\r\ncircumstances of the earth, and are perfectly in accordance with the\r\nprinciples on which Fourier's theory rests.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\10: _Mém. Inst._ for 1821 (published 1826), p. 162.]\r\n\r\n2. _Climate._--The term _climate_, which means _inclination_, was\r\napplied by the ancients to denote that inclination of the axis of\r\nthe terrestrial sphere from which result the inequalities of days in\r\ndifferent latitudes. This inequality is obviously connected also\r\nwith a difference of thermotical condition. Places near the poles\r\nare colder, on the whole, than places near the equator. It was a\r\nnatural object of curiosity to determine the law of this variation.\r\n\r\nSuch a determination, however, involves many difficulties, and the\r\nsettlement of several preliminary points. How is the temperature of\r\nany place to be estimated? and if we reply, by its _mean_\r\ntemperature, how are we to learn this mean? The answers to such\r\nquestions require very multiplied observations, exact instruments,\r\nand judicious generalizations; and cannot be given here. But certain\r\nfirst approximations may be obtained without much difficulty; for\r\ninstance, the mean temperature of any place may be taken to be the\r\ntemperature of deep springs, which is probably identical with the\r\ntemperature of the soil below the reach of the annual oscillations.\r\nProceeding on such facts, Mayer found that the mean temperature of\r\nany place was nearly proportional to the square of the cosine of the\r\nlatitude. This, as a law of phenomena, has since been found to\r\nrequire considerable correction; and it appears that the mean\r\ntemperature does not depend on the latitude alone, but on the\r\ndistribution of land and water, and on other causes. M. de Humboldt\r\nhas expressed these deviations[12\\10] by his map of _isothermal\r\nlines_, and Sir D. Brewster has endeavored to reduce them to a law\r\nby assuming two _poles of maximum cold_.\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\10: British Assoc. 1833. Prof. Forbes's _Report on\r\nMeteorology_, p. 215.]\r\n\r\nThe expression which Fourier finds[13\\10] for the distribution of\r\nheat in a homogeneous sphere, is not immediately comparable with\r\nMayer's empirical formula, being obtained on a certain hypothesis,\r\nnamely, that the equator is kept constantly at a fixed temperature.\r\nBut there is still a general agreement; for, according to the\r\ntheory, there is a diminution of heat in proceeding from the equator\r\nto the poles in such a case; the heat is propagated from the equator\r\nand the neighboring parts, and radiates out from the poles into the\r\nsurrounding space. And thus, in the case of the earth, the solar\r\nheat enters in the tropical {147} parts, and constantly flows\r\ntowards the polar regions, by which it is emitted into the planetary\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\10: Fourier. _Mém. Inst._ tom. v. p. 173.]\r\n\r\nClimate is affected by many thermotic influences, besides the\r\nconduction and radiation of the solid mass of the earth. The\r\natmosphere, for example, produces upon terrestrial temperatures\r\neffects which it is easy to see are very great; but these it is not\r\nyet in the power of calculation to appreciate;[14\\10] and it is\r\nclear that they depend upon other properties of air besides its\r\npower to transmit heat. We must therefore dismiss them, at least for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\10: _Mém. Inst._ tom. vii. p. 584]\r\n\r\n3. _Temperature of the Interior of the Earth._--The question of the\r\ntemperature of the interior of the earth has excited great interest,\r\nin consequence of its bearing on other branches of knowledge. The\r\nvarious facts which have been supposed to indicate the fluidity of\r\nthe central parts of the terrestrial globe, belong, in general, to\r\ngeological science; but so far as they require the light of\r\nthermotical calculations in order to be rightly reasoned upon, they\r\nproperly come under our notice here.\r\n\r\nThe principal problem of this kind which has been treated of is\r\nthis:--If in the globe of the earth there be a certain original\r\nheat, resulting from its earlier condition, and independent of the\r\naction of the sun, to what results will this give rise? and how far\r\ndo the observed temperatures of points below the surface lead us to\r\nsuch a supposition? It has, for instance, been asserted, that in\r\nmany parts of the world the temperature, as observed in mines and\r\nother excavations, increases in descending, at the rate of one degree\r\n(centesimal) in about forty yards. What inference does this justify?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question was given by Fourier and by Laplace. The\r\nformer mathematician had already considered the problem of the\r\ncooling of a large sphere, in his Memoirs of 1807, 1809, and 1811.\r\nThese, however, lay unpublished in the archives of the Institute for\r\nmany years. But in 1820, when the accumulation of observations which\r\nindicated an increase of the temperature of the earth as we descend,\r\nhad drawn observation to the subject, Fourier gave, in the Bulletin\r\nof the Philomathic Society,[15\\10] a summary of his results, as far\r\nas they bore on this point. His conclusion was, that such an\r\nincrease of temperature in proceeding towards the centre of the\r\nearth, can arise from nothing but the remains of a primitive\r\nheat;--that the heat which the sun's action would communicate,\r\nwould, in its final and {148} permanent state, be uniform in the\r\nsame vertical line, as soon as we get beyond the influence of the\r\nsuperficial oscillations of which we have spoken;--and that, before\r\nthe distribution of temperature reaches this limit, it will\r\ndecrease, not increase, in descending. It appeared also, by the\r\ncalculation, that this remaining existence of the primitive heat in\r\nthe interior of the earth's mass, was quite consistent with the\r\nabsence of all perceptible traces of it at the surface; and that the\r\nsame state of things which produces an increase of one degree of\r\nheat in descending forty yards, does not make the surface a quarter\r\nof a degree hotter than it would otherwise be. Fourier was led also\r\nto some conclusions, though necessarily very vague ones, respecting\r\nthe time which the earth must have taken to cool from a supposed\r\noriginal state of incandescence to its present condition, which time\r\nit appeared must have been very great; and respecting the extent of\r\nthe future cooling of the surface, which it was shown must be\r\ninsensible. Everything tended to prove that, within the period which\r\nthe history of the human race embraces, no discoverable change of\r\ntemperature had taken place from the progress of this central\r\ncooling. Laplace further calculated the effect[16\\10] which any\r\ncontraction of the globe of the earth by cooling would produce on\r\nthe length of the day. He had already shown, by astronomical\r\nreasoning, that the day had not become shorter by 1⁄200th of a\r\nsecond, since the time of Hipparchus; and thus his inferences agreed\r\nwith those of Fourier. As far as regards the smallness of the\r\nperceptible effect due to the past changes of the earth's\r\ntemperature, there can be no doubt that all the curious conclusions\r\njust stated are deduced in a manner quite satisfactory, from the\r\nfact of a general increase of heat in descending below the surface\r\nof the earth; and thus our principles of speculative science have a\r\nbearing upon the history of the past changes of the universe, and\r\ngive us information concerning the state of things in portions of\r\ntime otherwise quite out of our reach.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\10: _Bullet. des Sc._ 1820, p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\10: _Conn. des Tems_, 1823.]\r\n\r\n4. _Heat of the Planetary Spaces._--In the same manner, this portion\r\nof science is appealed to for information concerning parts of space\r\nwhich are utterly inaccessible to observation. The doctrine of heat\r\nleads to conclusions concerning the temperatures of the spaces which\r\nsurround the earth, and in which the planets of the solar system\r\nrevolve. In his Memoir, published in 1827,[17\\10] Fourier states\r\nthat he conceives it to follow from his principles, that these\r\nplanetary spaces {149} are not absolutely cold, but have a \"proper\r\nheat\" independent of the sun and of the planets. If there were not\r\nsuch a heat, the cold of the polar regions would be much more\r\nintense than it is, and the alternations of cold and warmth, arising\r\nfrom the influence of the sun, would be far more extreme and sudden\r\nthan we find them. As the cause of this heat in the planetary\r\nspaces, he assigns the radiation of the innumerable stars which are\r\nscattered through the universe.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\10: _Mém. Inst._ tom. vii. p. 580.]\r\n\r\nFourier says,[18\\10] \"We conclude from these various remarks, and\r\nprincipally from the mathematical examination of the question,\" that\r\nthis is so. I am not aware that the mathematical calculation which\r\nbears peculiarly upon this point has anywhere been published. But it\r\nis worth notice, that Svanberg has been led[19\\10] to the opinion of\r\nthe same temperature in these spaces which Fourier had adopted (50\r\ncentigrade below zero), by an entirely different course of\r\nreasoning, founded on the relation of the atmosphere to heat.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\10: _Mém. Inst._ tom. vii. p. 581.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\10: Berzel. _Jahres Bericht_, xi. p. 50.]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this subject, I have been led to notice incomplete\r\nand perhaps doubtful applications of the mathematical doctrine of\r\nconduction and radiation. But this may at least serve to show that\r\nThermotics is a science, which, like Mechanics, is to be established\r\nby experiments on masses capable of manipulation, but which, like\r\nthat, has for its most important office the solution of geological\r\nand cosmological problems. I now return to the further progress of\r\nour thermotical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Correction of Newton's Law of Cooling._\r\n\r\nIN speaking of the establishment of Newton's assumption, that the\r\ntemperature communicated is proportional to the excess of\r\ntemperature, we stated that it was approximately verified, and\r\nafterwards corrected (chap. i., sect. 1.)**. This correction was the\r\nresult of the researches of MM. Dulong and Petit in 1817, and the\r\nresearches by which they were led to the true law, are an admirable\r\nexample both of laborious experiment and sagacious induction. They\r\nexperimented through a very great range of temperature (as high as\r\ntwo hundred and forty degrees centigrade), which was necessary\r\nbecause the inaccuracy of Newton's law becomes considerable only at\r\nhigh temperatures. They removed the effect of the surrounding\r\nmedium, by making their experiments in a vacuum. They selected with\r\ngreat {150} judgment the conditions of their experiments and\r\ncomparisons, making one quantity vary while the others remained\r\nconstant. In this manner they found, that _the quickness of cooling\r\nfor a constant excess of temperature, increases in geometrical\r\nprogression, when the temperature of the surrounding space increases\r\nin arithmetical progression_; whereas, according to the Newtonian\r\nlaw, this quickness would not have varied at all. Again, this\r\nvariation being left out of the account, it appeared that _the\r\nquickness of cooling, so far as it depends on the excess of\r\ntemperature of the hot body, increases as the terms of a geometrical\r\nprogression diminished by a constant number, when the temperature of\r\nthe hot body increases in arithmetical progression_. These two laws,\r\nwith the coefficients requisite for their application to particular\r\nsubstances, fully determine the conditions of cooling in a vacuum.\r\n\r\nStarting from this determination, MM. Dulong and Petit proceeded to\r\nascertain the effect of the medium, in which the hot body is placed,\r\nupon its rate of cooling; for this effect became a _residual\r\nphenomenon_,[20\\10] when the cooling in the vacuum was taken away.\r\nWe shall not here follow this train of research; but we may briefly\r\nstate, that they were led to such laws as this;--that the rapidity\r\nof cooling due to any gaseous medium in which the body is placed, is\r\nthe same, so long as the excess of the body's temperature is the\r\nsame, although the temperature itself vary;--that the cooling power\r\nof a gas varies with the elasticity, according to a determined law;\r\nand other similar rules.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\10: See _Phil. Ind. Sciences_, B. xiii. c. 7, Sect. iv.]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the process of their induction, it is worthy of\r\nnotice, that they founded their reasonings upon Prevost's law of\r\nexchanges; and that, in this way, the second of their laws above\r\nstated, respecting the quickness of cooling, was a mathematical\r\nconsequence of the first. It may be observed also, that their\r\ntemperatures are measured by means of the air-thermometer, and that\r\nif they were estimated on another scale, the remarkable simplicity\r\nand symmetry of their results would disappear. This is a strong\r\nargument for believing such a measure of temperature to have a\r\nnatural prerogative of simplicity. This belief is confirmed by other\r\nconsiderations; but these, depending on the laws of _expansion_ by\r\nheat, cannot be here referred to; and we must proceed to finish our\r\nsurvey of the mathematical theory of heat, as founded on the\r\nphenomena of radiation and conduction, which alone have as yet been\r\ntraced up to general principles.\r\n\r\nWe may observe, before we quit this subject, that this correction of\r\n{151} Newton's law will materially affect the mathematical\r\ncalculations on the subject, which were made to depend on that law\r\nboth by Fourier, Laplace, and Poisson. Probably, however, the\r\ngeneral features of the results will be the same as on the old\r\nsupposition. M. Libri, an Italian mathematician, has undertaken one\r\nof the problems of this kind, that of the armil, with Dulong and\r\nPetit's law for his basis, in a Memoir read to the Institute of\r\nFrance in 1825, and since published at Florence.[21\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\10: _Mém. de Math. et de Phys._ 1829.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_Other Laws of Phenomena with respect to Radiation._\r\n\r\nTHE laws of radiation as depending upon the surface of radiating\r\nbodies, and as affecting screens of various kinds interposed between\r\nthe hot body and the thermometer, were examined by several\r\ninquirers. I shall not attempt to give an account of the latter\r\ncourse of research, and of the different laws which luminous and\r\nnon-luminous heat have been found to follow in reference to bodies,\r\nwhether transparent or opaque, which intercept them. But there are\r\ntwo or three laws of the phenomena, depending upon the effects of\r\nthe surfaces of bodies, which are important.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, the powers of bodies to _emit_ and to\r\n_absorb_ heat, as far as depends upon their surface, appear to be in\r\nthe same proportion. If we blacken the surface of a canister of hot\r\nwater, it radiates heat more copiously; and in the same measure, it\r\nis more readily heated by radiation.\r\n\r\n2. In the next place, as the radiative power increases, the power of\r\nreflection diminishes, and the contrary. A bright metal vessel\r\nreflects much heat; on this very account it does not emit much; and\r\nhence a hot fluid which such a vessel contains, remains hot longer\r\nthan it does in an unpolished case.\r\n\r\n3. The heat is emitted from every point of the surface of a hot body\r\nin all directions; but by no means in all directions with equal\r\nintensity. The intensity of the heating ray is as the sine of the\r\nangle which it makes with the surface.\r\n\r\nThe last law is entirely, the two former in a great measure, due to\r\nthe researches of Leslie, whose _Experimental Inquiry into the\r\nNature and Propagation of Heat_, published in 1804, contains a great\r\nnumber of curious and striking results and speculations. The laws\r\nnow just {152} stated bear, in a very important manner, upon the\r\nformation of the theory; and we must now proceed to consider what\r\nappears to have been done in this respect; taking into account, it\r\nmust still be borne in mind, only the phenomena of conduction and\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 7.--_Fourier's Theory of Radiant Heat._\r\n\r\nTHE above laws of phenomena being established, it was natural that\r\nphilosophers should seek to acquire some conception of the physical\r\naction by which they might account, both for these laws, and for the\r\ngeneral fundamental facts of Thermotics; as, for instance, the fact\r\nthat all bodies placed in an inclosed space assume, in time, the\r\ntemperature of the inclosure. Fourier's explanation of this class of\r\nphenomena must be considered as happy and successful; for he has\r\nshown that the supposition to which we are led by the most simple\r\nand general of the facts, will explain, moreover, the less obvious\r\nlaws. It is an obvious and general fact, that bodies which are\r\nincluded in the space tend to acquire the same temperature. And this\r\nidentity of temperature of neighboring bodies requires an\r\nhypothesis, which, it is found, also accounts for Leslie's law of\r\nthe sine, in radiation.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is, that the radiation takes place, not from the\r\nsurface alone of the hot body, but from all particles situated\r\nwithin a certain small depth of the surface. It is easy to\r\nsee[22\\10] that, on this supposition, a ray emitted obliquely from\r\nan internal particle, will be less intense than one sent forth\r\nperpendicular to the surface, because the former will be intercepted\r\nin a greater degree, having a greater length of path within the\r\nbody; and Fourier shows, that whatever be the law of this\r\nintercepting power, the result will be, that the radiative intensity\r\nis as the sine of the angle made by the ray with the surface.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\10: _Mém. Inst._ t. v. 1821, p. 204.]\r\n\r\nBut this law is, as I have said, likewise necessary, in order that\r\nneighboring bodies may tend to assume the same temperature: for\r\ninstance, in order that a small particle placed within a spherical\r\nshell, should finally assume the temperature of the shell. If the\r\nlaw of the sines did not obtain, the final temperature of such a\r\nparticle would depend upon its place in the inclosure;[23\\10] and\r\nwithin a shell of ice we should have, at certain points, the\r\ntemperature of boiling water and of melting iron.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\10: _An. Chim._ iv. 1817, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nThis proposition may at first appear strange and unlikely; but it\r\nmay {153} be shown to be a necessary consequence of the assumed\r\nprinciple, by very simple reasoning, which I shall give in a general\r\nform in a Note.[24\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\10: The following reasoning may show the connexion of the\r\nlaw of the sines in radiant heat with the general principle of\r\nultimate identity of neighboring temperatures. The equilibrium and\r\nidentity of temperature between an including shell and an included\r\nbody, cannot obtain upon the whole, except it obtain between each\r\npair of parts of the two surfaces of the body and of the shell; that\r\nis, any part of the one surface, in its exchanges with any part of\r\nthe other surface, must give and receive the same quantity of heat.\r\nNow the quantity exchanged, so far as it depends on the receiving\r\nsurface, will, by geometry, be proportional to the sine of the\r\nobliquity of that surface: and as, in the exchanges, each may be\r\nconsidered as receiving, the quantity transferred must be\r\nproportional to the sines of the two obliquities; that is, to that\r\nof the giving as well as of the receiving surface.\r\n\r\nNor is this conclusion disturbed by the consideration, that all the\r\nrays of heat which fall upon a surface are not absorbed, some being\r\nreflected according to the nature of the surface. For, by the other\r\nabove-mentioned laws of phenomena, we know that, in the same measure\r\nin which the surface loses the power of admitting, it loses the\r\npower of emitting, heat; and the superficial parts gain, by\r\nabsorbing their own radiation, as much as they lose by not absorbing\r\nthe incident heat; so that the result of the preceding reasoning\r\nremains unaltered.]\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is capable of being presented in a manner quite\r\nsatisfactory, by the use of mathematical symbols, and proves that\r\nLeslie's law of the sines is rigorously and mathematically true on\r\nFourier's hypothesis. And thus Fourier's theory of _molecular\r\nextra-radiation_ acquires great consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 8.--_Discovery of the Polarization of Heat._\r\n\r\nTHE laws of which the discovery is stated in the preceding Sections\r\nof this Chapter, and the explanations given of them by the theories\r\nof conduction and radiation, all tended to make the conception of a\r\nmaterial heat, or _caloric_, communicated by an actual flow and\r\nemission, familiar to men's minds; and, till lately, had led the\r\ngreater part of thermotical philosophers to entertain such a view,\r\nas the most probable opinion concerning the nature of heat. But some\r\nsteps have recently been made in thermotics, which appear to be\r\nlikely to overturn this belief, and to make the doctrine of emission\r\nas untenable with regard to heat, as it had been found to be with\r\nregard to light. I speak of the discovery of the polarization of\r\nheat. It being ascertained that rays of heat are polarized in the\r\nsame manner as rays of {154} light, we cannot retain the doctrine\r\nthat heat radiates by the emanation of material particles, without\r\nsupposing those particles of caloric to have poles; an hypothesis\r\nwhich probably no one would embrace; for, besides that the ill\r\nfortune which attended that hypothesis in the case of light must\r\ndeter speculators from it, the intimate connexion of heat and light\r\nwould hardly allow us to suppose polarization in the two cases to be\r\nproduced by two different kinds of machinery.\r\n\r\nBut, without here tracing further the influence which the\r\npolarization of heat must exercise upon the formation of our\r\ntheories of heat, we must briefly notice this important discovery,\r\nas a law of phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe analogies and connexions between light and heat are so strong,\r\nthat when the polarization of light had been discovered, men were\r\nnaturally led to endeavor to ascertain whether heat possessed any\r\ncorresponding property. But partly from the difficulty of obtaining\r\nany considerable effect of heat separated from light, and partly\r\nfrom the want of a thermometrical apparatus sufficiently delicate,\r\nthese attempts led, for some time, to no decisive result. M. Berard\r\ntook up the subject in 1813. He used Malus's apparatus, and\r\nconceived that he found heat to be polarized by reflection at the\r\nsurface of glass, in the same manner as light, and with the same\r\ncircumstances.[25\\10] But when Professor Powell, of Oxford, a few\r\nyears later (1830), repeated these experiments with a similar\r\napparatus, he found[26\\10] that though the heat which is conveyed\r\nalong with light is, of course, polarizable, \"simple radiant heat,\"\r\nas he terms it, did not offer the smallest difference in the two\r\nrectangular azimuths of the second glass, and thus showed no trace\r\nof polarization.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\10: _Ann. Chim._ March, 1813.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\10: _Edin. Journ. of Science_, 1830, vol. ii. p. 303.]\r\n\r\nThus, with the old thermometers, the point remained doubtful. But\r\nsoon after this time, MM. Melloni and Nobili invented an apparatus,\r\ndepending on certain galvanic laws, of which we shall have to speak\r\nhereafter, which they called a _thermomultiplier_; and which was\r\nmuch more sensitive to changes of temperature than any\r\npreviously-known instrument. Yet even with this instrument, M.\r\nMelloni failed; and did not, at first, detect any perceptible\r\npolarization of heat by the tourmaline;[27\\10] nor did M.\r\nNobili,[28\\10] in repeating M. Berard's experiment. But in this\r\nexperiment the attempt was made to polarize heat by reflection from\r\nglass, as light is polarized: and the quantity {155} reflected is so\r\nsmall that the inevitable errors might completely disguise the whole\r\ndifference in the two opposite positions. When Prof. Forbes, of\r\nEdinburgh, (in 1834,) employed mica in the like experiments, he\r\nfound a very decided polarizing effect; first, when the heat was\r\ntransmitted through several films of mica at a certain angle, and\r\nafterwards, when it was reflected from them. In this case, he found\r\nthat with non-luminous heat, and even with the heat of water below\r\nthe boiling point, the difference of the heating power in the two\r\npositions of opposite polarity (parallel and _crossed_) was\r\nmanifest. He also detected by careful experiments,[29\\10] the\r\npolarizing effect of tourmaline. This important discovery was soon\r\nconfirmed by M. Melloni. Doubts were suggested whether the different\r\neffect in the opposite positions might not be due to other\r\ncircumstances; but Professor Forbes easily showed that these\r\nsuppositions were inadmissible; and the property of a difference of\r\n_sides_, which at first seemed so strange when ascribed to the rays\r\nof light, also belongs, it seems to be proved, to the rays of heat.\r\nProfessor Forbes also found, by interposing a plate of mica to\r\nintercept the ray of heat in an intermediate point, an effect was\r\nproduced in certain positions of the mica analogous to what was\r\ncalled _depolarization_ in the case of light; namely, a partial\r\ndestruction of the differences which polarization establishes.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\10: _Ann. de Chimie_, vol. lv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\10: _Bibliothèque Universelle_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\10: _Ed. R. S. Transactions_, vol. xiv.; and _Phil. Mag._\r\n1835, vol. v. p. 209. Ib. vol. vii. p. 349.]\r\n\r\nBefore this discovery, M. Melloni had already proved by experiment\r\nthat heat is _refracted_ by transparent substances as light is. In\r\nthe case of light, the _depolarizing_ effect was afterwards found to\r\nbe really, as we have seen, a _dipolarizing_ effect, the ray being\r\ndivided into two rays by _double refraction_. We are naturally much\r\ntempted to put the same interpretation upon the dipolarizing effect\r\nin the case of heat; but perhaps the assertion of the analogy\r\nbetween light and heat to this extent is as yet insecure.\r\n\r\nIt is the more necessary to be cautious in our attempt to identify\r\nthe laws of light and heat, inasmuch as along with all the\r\nresemblances of the two agents, there are very important\r\ndifferences. The power of transmitting light, _the diaphaneity_ of\r\nbodies, is very distinct from their power of transmitting heat,\r\nwhich has been called _diathermancy_ by M. Melloni. Thus both a\r\nplate of alum and a plate of rock-salt transmit nearly the whole\r\nlight; but while the first stops nearly the whole heat, the second\r\nstops very little of it; and a plate of opake {156} quartz, nearly\r\nimpenetrable by light, allows a large portion of the heat to pass.\r\nBy passing the rays through various media, the heat may be, as it\r\nwere, _sifted_ from the light which accompanies it.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The diathermancy of bodies is distinct from their\r\ndiaphaneity, in so far that the same bodies do not exercise the same\r\npowers of selection and suppression of certain rays on heat and on\r\nlight; but it appears to be proved by the investigations of modern\r\nthermotical philosophers (MM. De la Roche, Powell, Melloni, and\r\nForbes), that there is a close analogy between the absorption of\r\ncertain colors by transparent bodies, and the absorption of certain\r\nkinds of heat by diathermanous bodies. Dark sources of heat emit\r\nrays which are analogous to blue and violet rays of light; and\r\nhighly luminous sources emit rays which are analogous to red rays.\r\nAnd by measuring the angle of total reflection for heat of different\r\nkinds, it has been shown that the former kind of calorific rays are\r\nreally less refrangible than the latter.[30\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\10: See Prof. Forbes's _Third Series of Researches on\r\nHeat_, _Edinb. R.S. Trans._ vol. xiv.]\r\n\r\nM. Melloni has assumed this analogy as so completely established,\r\nthat he has proposed for this part of thermotics the name\r\n_Thermochroology_ (Qu. _Chromothermotics_?); and along with this\r\nterm, many others derived from the Greek, and founded on the same\r\nanalogy. If it should appear, in the work which he proposes to\r\npublish on this subject, that the doctrines which he has to state\r\ncannot easily be made intelligible without the use of the terms he\r\nsuggests, his nomenclature will obtain currency; but so large a mass\r\nof etymological innovations is in general to be avoided in\r\nscientific works.\r\n\r\nM. Melloni's discovery of the extraordinary power of _rock-salt_ to\r\ntransmit heat, and Professor Forbes's discovery of the extraordinary\r\npower of _mica_ to polarize and depolarize heat, have supplied\r\nthermotical inquirers with two new and most valuable\r\ninstruments.[31\\10]]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\10: For an account of many thermotical researches, which I\r\nhave been obliged to pass unnoticed here, see two Reports by Prof.\r\nPowell on the present state of our knowledge respecting Radiant\r\nHeat, in the _Reports of the British Association_ for 1832 and 1840.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, besides the laws of conduction and radiation, many other\r\nlaws of the phenomena of heat have been discovered by philosophers;\r\nand these must be taken into account in judging any theory of heat.\r\nTo these other laws we must now turn our attention. {157}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF CHANGES OCCASIONED BY HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Expansion by Heat.--The Law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac\r\nfor Gases._\r\n\r\nALMOST all bodies expand by heat; solids, as metals, in a small\r\ndegree; fluids, as water, oil, alcohol, mercury, in a greater\r\ndegree. This was one of the facts first examined by those who\r\nstudied the nature of heat, because this property was used for the\r\nmeasure of heat. In the _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, Book\r\niv., Chap. iv., I have stated that secondary qualities, such as\r\nHeat, must be measured by their effects: and in Sect. 4 of that\r\nChapter I have given an account of the successive attempts which\r\nhave been made to obtain measures of heat. I have there also spoken\r\nof the results which were obtained by comparing the rate at which\r\nthe expansion of different substances went on, under the same\r\ndegrees of heat; or as it was called, the different _thermometrical\r\nmarch_ of each substance. Mercury appears to be the liquid which is\r\nmost uniform in its thermometrical march; and it has been taken as\r\nthe most common material of our thermometers; but the expansion of\r\nmercury is not proportional to the heat. De Luc was led, by his\r\nexperiments, to conclude \"that the dilatations of mercury follow an\r\naccelerated march for equal augmentations of heat.\" Dalton\r\nconjectured that water and mercury both expand as the square of the\r\n_real temperature_ from the point of greatest contraction: the real\r\ntemperature being measured so as to lead to such a result. But none\r\nof the rules thus laid down for the expansion of solids and fluids\r\nappear to have led, as yet, to any certain general laws.\r\n\r\nWith regard to gases, thermotical inquirers have been more\r\nsuccessful. Gases expand by heat; and their expansion is governed by\r\na law which applies alike to all degrees of heat, and to all gaseous\r\nfluids. The law is this: that _for equal increments of temperature\r\nthey expand by the same fraction of their own bulk_; which fraction\r\nis _three-eights_ {158} in proceeding from freezing to boiling\r\nwater. This law was discovered by Dalton and M. Gay-Lussac\r\nindependently of each other;[32\\10] and is usually called by both\r\ntheir names, _the law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac_. The latter\r\nsays,[33\\10] \"The experiments which I have described, and which have\r\nbeen made with great care, prove incontestably that oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, azotic acid, nitrous acid, ammoniacal acid, muriatic acid,\r\nsulphurous acid, carbonic acid, gases, expand equally by equal\r\nincrements of heat.\" \"Therefore,\" he adds with a proper inductive\r\ngeneralization, \"the result does not depend upon physical\r\nproperties, and I collect that _all gases expand equally by heat_.\"\r\nHe then extends this to vapors, as ether. This must be one of the\r\nmost important foundation-stones of any sound theory of heat.\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\10: _Manch. Mem._ vol. v. 1802; and _Ann. Chim._ xliii.\r\np. 137.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\10: Ib. p. 272.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] Yet MM. Magnus and Regnault conceive that they have\r\noverthrown this law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac, and shown that the\r\ndifferent gases do not expand alike for the same increment of heat.\r\nMagnus found the ratio to be for atmospheric air, 1∙366; for\r\nhydrogen, 1∙365; for carbonic acid, 1∙369; for sulphurous-acid gas,\r\n1∙385. But these differences are not greater than the differences\r\nobtained for the same substances by different observers; and as this\r\nlaw is referred to in Laplace's hypothesis, hereafter to be\r\ndiscussed, I do not treat the law as disproved.\r\n\r\nYet that the rate of expansion of gas in certain circumstances is\r\ndifferent for different substances, must be deemed very probable,\r\nafter Dr. Faraday's recent investigations _On the Liquefaction and\r\nSolidification of Bodies generally existing as Gases_,[34\\10] by\r\nwhich it appears that the elasticity of vapors _in contact with\r\ntheir fluids_ increases at different rates in different substances.\r\n\"That the force,\" he says, \"of vapor increases in a geometrical\r\nratio for equal increments of heat is true for all bodies, but the\r\nratio is not the same for all. . . . For an increase of pressure\r\nfrom two to six atmospheres, the following number of degrees require\r\nto be added to the bodies named:--water 69°, sulphureous acid 63°,\r\ncyanogen 64°∙5, ammonia 60°, arseniuretted hydrogen 54°,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen 56°∙5, muriatic acid 43°, carbonic acid 32°∙5,\r\nnitrous oxide 30°.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\10: _Phil. Trans._ 1845, Pt. 1.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the opinion that the air-thermometer is a\r\ntrue measure of heat, is strongly countenanced by the symmetry\r\nwhich, by using it, we introduce into the laws of radiation. If we\r\n{159} accept the law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac, it follows that this\r\nresult is independent of any peculiar properties in the air\r\nemployed; and thus this measure has an additional character of\r\ngenerality and simplicity which make it still more probable that it\r\nis the true standard. This opinion is further supported by the\r\nattempts to include such facts in a theory; but before we can treat\r\nof such theories, we must speak of some other doctrines which have\r\nbeen introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Specific Heat.--Change of Consistence._\r\n\r\nIN the attempts to obtain measures of heat, it was found that bodies\r\nhad different capacities for heat; for the same quantity of heat,\r\nhowever measured, would raise, in different degrees, the temperature\r\nof different substances. The notion of different capacities for heat\r\nwas thus introduced, and each body was thus assumed to have a\r\nspecific _capacity for heat_, according to the quantity of heat\r\nwhich it required to raise it through a given scale of heat.[35\\10]\r\nThe term \"capacity for heat\" was introduced by Dr. Irvine, a pupil\r\nof Dr. Black. For this term, Wilcke, the Swedish physicist,\r\nsubstituted \"specific heat;\" in analogy with \"specific gravity.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\10: See Crawford, _On Heat_, for the History of Specific\r\nHeat.]\r\n\r\nIt was found, also, that the capacity of the same substance was\r\ndifferent in the same substance at different temperatures. It\r\nappears from experiments of MM. Dulong and Petit, that, in general,\r\nthe capacity of liquids and solids increases as we ascend in the\r\nscale of temperature.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most important thermotic facts is, that by the sudden\r\ncontraction of any mass, its temperature is increased. This is\r\npeculiarly observable in gases, as, for example, common air. The\r\namount of the increase of temperature by sudden condensation, or of\r\nthe cold produced by sudden rarefaction, is an important datum,\r\ndetermining the velocity of sound, as we have already seen, and\r\naffecting many points of meteorology. The coefficient which enters\r\nthe calculation in the former case depends on the ratio of two\r\nspecific heats of air under different conditions; one belonging to\r\nit when, varying in density, the pressure is constant by which the\r\nair is contained; the other, when, varying in density, it is\r\ncontained in a constant space.\r\n\r\nA leading fact, also, with regard to the operation of heat on bodies\r\n{160} is, that it changes their _form_, as it is often called, that\r\nis, their condition as solid, liquid, or air. Since the term \"form\"\r\nis employed in too many and various senses to be immediately\r\nunderstood when it is intended to convey this peculiar meaning, I\r\nshall use, instead of it, the term _consistence_, and shall hope to\r\nbe excused, even when I apply this word to gases, though I must\r\nacknowledge such phraseology to be unusual. Thus there is a change\r\nof consistence when solids become liquid, or liquids gaseous; and\r\nthe laws of such changes must be fundamental facts of our\r\nthermotical theories. We are still in the dark as to many of the\r\nlaws which belong to this change; but one of them, of great\r\nimportance, has been discovered, and to that we must now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_The Doctrine of Latent Heat._\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine of Latent Heat refers to such changes of consistence as\r\nwe have just spoken of. It is to this effect; that during the\r\nconversion of solids into liquids, or of liquids into vapors, there\r\nis communicated to the body heat which is not indicated by the\r\nthermometer. The heat is absorbed, or becomes _latent_; and, on the\r\nother hand, on the condensation of the vapor to a liquid, or the\r\nliquid to a solid consistency, this heat is again given out and\r\nbecomes sensible. Thus a pound of ice requires twenty times as long\r\na time, in a warm room, to raise its temperature seven degrees, as a\r\npound of ice-cold water does. A kettle placed on a fire, in four\r\nminutes had its temperature raised to the boiling point, 212°: and\r\nthis temperature continued stationary for twenty minutes, when the\r\nwhole was boiled away. Dr. Black inferred from these facts that a\r\nlarge quantity of heat is absorbed by the ice in becoming water, and\r\nby the water in becoming steam. He reckoned from the above\r\nexperiments, that ice, in melting, absorbs as much heat as would\r\nraise ice-cold water through 140° of temperature: and that water, in\r\nevaporating, absorbs as much heat as would raise it through 940°.\r\n\r\nThat snow requires a great quantity of heat to melt it; that water\r\nrequires a great quantity of heat to convert it into steam; and that\r\nthis heat is not indicated by a rise in the thermometer, are facts\r\nwhich it is not difficult to observe; but to separate these from all\r\nextraneous conditions, to group the cases together, and to seize\r\nupon the general law by which they are connected, was an effort of\r\ninductive insight, which has been considered, and deservedly, as one\r\nof the most striking {161} events in the modern history of physics.\r\nOf this step the principal merit appears to belong to Black.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [In the first edition I had mentioned the names of De Luc\r\nand of Wilcke, in connexion with the discovery of Latent Heat, along\r\nwith the name of Black. De Luc had observed, in 1755, that ice, in\r\nmelting, did not rise above the freezing-point of temperature till\r\nthe whole was melted. De Luc has been charged with plagiarizing\r\nBlack's discovery, but, I think, without any just ground. In his\r\n_Idées sur la Météorologique_ (1787), he spoke of Dr. Black as \"the\r\nfirst who had attempted the determinations of the quantities of\r\nlatent heat.\" And when Mr. Watt pointed out to him that from this\r\nexpression it might be supposed that Black had not discovered the\r\nfact itself, he acquiesced, and redressed the equivocal expression\r\nin an Appendix to the volume.[36\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\10: See his _Letter_ to the Editors of the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, No. xii. p. 502, of the _Review_.]\r\n\r\nBlack never published his own account of the doctrine of Latent\r\nHeat: but he delivered it every year after 1760 in his Lectures. In\r\n1770, a surreptitious publication of his Lectures was made by a\r\nLondon bookseller, and this gave a view of the leading points of Dr.\r\nBlack's doctrine. In 1772, Wilcke, of Stockholm, read a paper to the\r\nRoyal Society of that city, in which the absorption of heat by\r\nmelting ice is described; and in the same year, De Luc of Geneva\r\npublished his _Recherches sur les Modifications de l'Atmosphère_,\r\nwhich has been alleged to contain the doctrine of latent heat, and\r\nwhich the author asserts to have been written in ignorance of what\r\nBlack had done. At a later period, De Luc, adopting, in part.\r\nBlack's expression, gave the name of _latent fire_ to the heat\r\nabsorbed.[37\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\10: See _Ed. Rev._ No. vi. p. 20.]\r\n\r\nIt appears that Cavendish determined the amount of heat produced by\r\ncondensing steam, and by thawing snow, as early as 1765. He had\r\nperhaps already heard something of Black's investigations, but did\r\nnot accept his term \"latent heat\".**[38\\10]]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\10: See Mr. V. Harcourt's _Address_ to the Brit. Assoc. in\r\n1839, and the _Appendix_.]\r\n\r\nThe consequences of Black's principle are very important, for upon\r\nit is founded the whole doctrine of evaporation; besides which, the\r\nprinciple of latent heat has other applications. But the relations\r\nof aqueous vapor to air are so important, and have been so long a\r\n{162} subject of speculation, that we may with advantage dwell a\r\nlittle upon them. The part of science in which this is done may be\r\ncalled, as we have said, Atmology; and to that division of Thermotics\r\nthe following chapters belong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{163}}\r\nATMOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF VAPOR AND AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_The Boylean Law of the Air's Elasticity._\r\n\r\nIN the Sixth Book (Chap. iv. Sect. 1.) we have already seen how the\r\nconception on the laws of fluid equilibrium was, by Pascal and others,\r\nextended to air, as well as water. But though air presses and is\r\npressed as water presses and is pressed, pressure produces upon air an\r\neffect which it does not, in any obvious degree, produce upon water.\r\nAir which is pressed is also _compressed_, or made to occupy a smaller\r\nspace; and is consequently also made more dense, or _condensed_; and\r\non the other hand, when the pressure upon a portion of air is\r\ndiminished, the air expands or is rarefied. These broad facts are\r\nevident. They are expressed in a general way by saying that air is an\r\n_elastic_ fluid, yielding in a certain degree to pressure, and\r\nrecovering its previous dimensions when the pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nBut when men had reached this point, the questions obviously offered\r\nthemselves, in what degree and according to what law air yields to\r\npressure; when it is compressed, what relation does the density bear\r\nto the pressure? The use which had been made of tubes containing\r\ncolumns of mercury, by which the pressure of portions of air was\r\nvaried and measured, suggested obvious modes of devising experiments\r\nby which this question might be answered. Such experiments\r\naccordingly were made by Boyle about 1650; and the result at which\r\nhe arrived was, that when air is thus compressed, the density is as\r\nthe pressure. Thus if the pressure of the atmosphere in its common\r\nstate be equivalent to 30 inches of mercury, as shown by the\r\nbarometer; if air included in a tube be pressed by 30 additional\r\ninches of {164} mercury, its density will be doubled, the air being\r\ncompressed into one half the space. If the pressure be increased\r\nthreefold, the density is also trebled; and so on. The same law was\r\nsoon afterwards (in 1676) proved experimentally by Mariotte. And\r\nthis law of the air's elasticity, that the density is as the\r\npressure, is sometimes called the _Boylean Law_, and sometimes the\r\n_Law of Boyle and Mariotte_.\r\n\r\nAir retains its aerial character permanently; but there are other\r\naerial substances which appear as such, and then disappear or change\r\ninto some other condition. Such are termed _vapors_. And the\r\ndiscovery of their true relation to air was the result of a long\r\ncourse of researches and speculations.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [It was found by M. Cagniard de la Tour (in 1823), that at\r\na certain temperature, a liquid, under sufficient pressure, becomes\r\nclear transparent vapor or gas, having the same bulk as the liquid.\r\nThis condition Dr. Faraday calls the _Cagniard de la Tour_ state,\r\n(the _Tourian_ state?) It was also discovered by Dr. Faraday that\r\ncarbonic-acid gas, and many other gases, which were long conceived\r\nto be permanently elastic, are really reducible to a liquid state by\r\npressure.[39\\10] And in 1835, M. Thilorier found the means of\r\nreducing liquid carbonic acid to a solid form, by means of the cold\r\nproduced in evaporation. More recently Dr. Faraday has added several\r\nsubstances usually gaseous to the list of those which could\r\npreviously be shown in the liquid state, and has reduced others,\r\nincluding ammonia, nitrous oxide, and sulphuretted hydrogen, to a\r\nsolid consistency.[40\\10] After these discoveries, we may, I think,\r\nreasonably doubt whether all bodies are not capable of existing in\r\nthe three _consistencies_ of solid, liquid, and air.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\10: _Phil. Trans._ 1823.]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\10: Ib. Pt. 1. 1845.]\r\n\r\nWe may note that the law of Boyle and Mariotte is not exactly true\r\nnear the limit at which the air passes to the liquid state in such\r\ncases as that just spoken of. The diminution of bulk is then more\r\nrapid than the increase of pressure.\r\n\r\nThe transition of fluids from a liquid to an airy consistence\r\nappears to be accompanied by other curious phenomena. See Prof.\r\nForbes's papers on the _Color of Steam under certain circumstances_,\r\nand on the _Colors of the Atmosphere_, in the _Edin. Trans._ vol.\r\nxiv.] {165}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Prelude to Dalton's Doctrine of Evaporation._\r\n\r\nVISIBLE clouds, smoke, distillation, gave the notion of Vapor; vapor\r\nwas at first conceived to be identical with air, as by Bacon.[41\\10]\r\nIt was easily collected, that by heat, water might be converted into\r\nvapor. It was thought that air was thus produced, in the instrument\r\ncalled the _æolipile_, in which a powerful blast is caused by a\r\nboiling fluid; but Wolfe showed that the fluid was not converted\r\ninto air, by using camphorated spirit of wine, and condensing the\r\nvapor after it had been formed. We need not enumerate the doctrines\r\n(if very vague hypotheses may be so termed) of Descartes, Dechales,\r\nBorelli.[42\\10] The latter accounted for the rising of vapor by\r\nsupposing it a mixture of fire and water; and thus, fire being much\r\nlighter than air, the mixture also was light. Boyle endeavored to\r\nshow that vapors do not permanently float _in vacuo_. He compared\r\nthe mixture of vapor with air to that of salt with water. He found\r\nthat the pressure of the atmosphere affected the heat of boiling\r\nwater; a very important fact. Boyle proved this by means of the\r\nair-pump; and he and his friends were much surprised to find that\r\nwhen air was removed, water only just warm boiled violently. Huyghens\r\nmentions an experiment of the same kind made by Papin about 1673.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\10: Bacon's _Hist. Nat._ Cent. i. p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\10: They may be seen in Fischer, _Geschichte der Physik_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 175.]\r\n\r\nThe ascent of vapor was explained in various ways in succession,\r\naccording to the changes which physical science underwent. It was a\r\nproblem distinctly treated of, at a period when hydrostatics had\r\naccounted for many phenomena; and attempts were naturally made to\r\nreduce this fact to hydrostatical principles. An obvious hypothesis,\r\nwhich brought it under the dominion of these principles, was, to\r\nsuppose that the water, when converted into vapor, was divided into\r\nsmall hollow globules;--thin pellicles including air or heat. Halley\r\ngave such an explanation of evaporation; Leibnitz calculated the\r\ndimensions of these little bubbles; Derham managed (as he supposed)\r\nto examine them with a magnifying glass: Wolfe also examined and\r\ncalculated on the same subject. It is curious to see so much\r\nconfidence in so lame a theory; for if water became hollow globules\r\nin order to rise as vapor, we require, in order to explain the\r\nformation of these globules, new laws of nature, which are not even\r\nhinted at by {166} the supporters of the doctrine, though they must\r\nbe far more complex than the hydrostatical law by which a hollow\r\nsphere floats.\r\n\r\nNewton's opinion was hardly more satisfactory; he[43\\10] explained\r\nevaporation by the repulsive power of heat; the parts of vapors,\r\naccording to him, being small, are easily affected by this force,\r\nand thus become lighter than the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\10: _Opticks_, Qu. 31.]\r\n\r\nMuschenbroek still adhered to the theory of globules, as the\r\nexplanation of evaporation; but he was manifestly discontented with\r\nit; and reasonably apprehended that the pressure of the air would\r\ndestroy the frail texture of these bubbles. He called to his aid a\r\nrotation of the globules (which Descartes also had assumed); and,\r\nnot satisfied with this, threw himself on electrical action as a\r\nreserve. Electricity, indeed, was now in favor, as hydrostatics had\r\nbeen before; and was naturally called in, in all cases of\r\ndifficulty. Desaguliers, also, uses this agent to account for the\r\nascent of vapor, introducing it into a kind of sexual system of\r\nclouds; according to him, the male fire (heat) does a part, and the\r\nfemale fire (electricity) performs the rest. These are speculations\r\nof small merit and no value.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Chemistry made great progress in the estimation of\r\nphilosophers, and had its turn in the explanation of the important\r\nfacts of evaporation. Bouillet, who, in 1742, placed the particles\r\nof water in the interstices of those of air, may be considered as\r\napproaching to the chemical theory. In 1748, the Academy of Sciences\r\nof Bourdeaux proposed the ascent of vapors as the subject of a\r\nprize; which was adjudged in a manner very impartial as to the\r\nchoice of a theory; for it was divided between Kratzenstein, who\r\nadvocated the bubbles, (the coat of which he determined to be\r\n1⁄50,000th of an inch thick,) and Hamberger, who maintained the\r\ntruth to be the adhesion of particles of water to those of air and\r\nfire. The latter doctrine had become much more distinct in the\r\nauthor's mind when seven years afterwards (1750) he published his\r\n_Elementa Physices_. He then gave the explanation of evaporation in\r\na phrase which has since been adopted,--the _solution of water in\r\nair_; which he conceived to be of the same kind as other chemical\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nThis theory of solution was further advocated and developed by Le\r\nRoi;[44\\10] and in his hands assumed a form which has been\r\nextensively adopted up to our times, and has, in many instances,\r\ntinged the language commonly used. He conceived that air, like other\r\nsolvents, {167} might be _saturated_; and that when the water was\r\nbeyond the amount required for saturation, it appeared in a visible\r\nform. The saturating quantity was held to depend mainly on warmth\r\nand wind.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\10: _Ac. R. Sc._ Paris, 1750.]\r\n\r\nThis theory was by no means devoid of merit; for it brought together\r\nmany of the phenomena, and explained a number of the experiments\r\nwhich Le Roi made. It explained the facts of the transparency of\r\nvapor, (for perfect solutions are transparent,) the precipitation of\r\nwater by cooling, the disappearance of the visible moisture by\r\nwarming it again, the increased evaporation by rain and wind; and\r\nother observed phenomena. So far, therefore, the introduction of the\r\nnotion of the chemical solution of water in air was apparently very\r\nsuccessful. But its defects are of a very fatal kind; for it does\r\nnot at all apply to the facts which take place when air is excluded.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, in the mean time,[45\\10] the subject had been pursued in\r\na different, and in a more correct manner. Wallerius Ericsen had, by\r\nvarious experiments, established the important fact, that water\r\nevaporates in a _vacuum_. His experiments are clear and\r\nsatisfactory; and he inferred from them the falsity of the common\r\nexplanation of evaporation by the solution of water in _air_. His\r\nconclusions are drawn in a very intelligent manner. He considers the\r\nquestion whether water can be changed into air, and whether the\r\natmosphere is, in consequence, a mere collection of vapors; and on\r\ngood reasons, decides in the negative, and concludes the existence\r\nof permanently-elastic air different from vapor. He judges, also,\r\nthat there are two causes concerned, one acting to produce the first\r\nascent of vapors, the other to support them afterwards. The first,\r\nwhich acts in a vacuum, he conceives to be the mutual repulsion of\r\nthe particles; and since this force is independent of the presence\r\nof other substances, this seems to be a sound induction. When the\r\nvapors have once ascended into the air, it may readily be granted\r\nthat they are carried higher, and driven from side to side by the\r\ncurrents of the atmosphere. Wallerius conceives that the vapor will\r\nrise till it gets into air of the same density as itself, and being\r\nthen in equilibrium, will drift to and fro.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\10: Fischer, _Gesch. Phys._ vol. v. p. 63.]\r\n\r\nThe two rival theories of evaporation, that of _chemical solution_\r\nand that of _independent vapor_, were, in various forms, advocated\r\nby the next generation of philosophers. De Saussure may be\r\nconsidered as the leader on one side, and De Luc on the other. The\r\nformer maintained the solution theory, with some modifications of\r\nhis own. De {168} Luc denied all solution, and held vapor to be a\r\ncombination of the particles of water with fire, by which they\r\nbecame lighter than air. According to him, there is always fire\r\nenough present to produce this combination, so that evaporation goes\r\non at all temperatures.\r\n\r\nThis mode of considering independent vapor as a combination of fire\r\nwith water, led the attention of those who adopted that opinion to\r\nthe thermometrical changes which take place when vapor is formed and\r\ncondensed. These changes are important, and their laws curious. The\r\nlaws belong to the induction of latent heat, of which we have just\r\nspoken; but a knowledge of them is not absolutely necessary in order\r\nto enable us to understand the manner in which steam exists in air.\r\n\r\nDe Luc's views led him[46\\10] also to the consideration of the\r\neffect of pressure on vapor. He explains the fact that pressure will\r\ncondense vapor, by supposing that it brings the particles within the\r\ndistance at which the repulsion arising from fire ceases. In this\r\nway, he also explains the fact, that though external pressure does\r\nthus condense steam, the mixture of a body of air, by which the\r\npressure is equally increased, will not produce the same effect; and\r\ntherefore, vapors can exist in the atmosphere. They make no fixed\r\nproportion of it; but at the same temperature we have the same\r\npressure arising _from them_, whether they are in air or not. As the\r\nheat increases, vapor becomes capable of supporting a greater and\r\ngreater pressure, and at the boiling heat, it can support the\r\npressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\10: Fischer, vol. vii. p. 453. _Nouvelles Idées sur la\r\nMétéorologie_, 1787.]\r\n\r\nDe Luc also marked very precisely (as Wallerius had done) the\r\ndifference between vapor and air; the former being capable of change\r\nof _consistence_ by cold or pressure, the latter not so. Pictet, in\r\n1786, made a hygrometrical experiment, which appeared to him to\r\nconfirm De Luc's views; and De Luc, in 1792, published a concluding\r\nessay on the subject in the _Philosophical Transactions_. Pictet's\r\n_Essay on Fire_, in 1791, also demonstrated that \"all the train of\r\nhygrometrical phenomena takes place just as well, indeed rather\r\nquicker, in a vacuum than in air, provided the same quantity of\r\nmoisture is present.\" This essay, and De Luc's paper, gave the\r\ndeath-blow to the theory of the solution of water in air.\r\n\r\nYet this theory did not fall without an obstinate struggle. It was\r\ntaken up by the new school of French chemists, and connected with\r\ntheir views of heat. Indeed, it long appears as the prevalent\r\nopinion. {169} Girtanner,[47\\10] in his _Grounds of the\r\nAntiphlogistic Theory_, may be considered as one of the principal\r\nexpounders of this view of the matter. Hube, of Warsaw, was,\r\nhowever, the strongest of the defenders of the theory of solution,\r\nand published upon it repeatedly about 1790. Yet he appears to have\r\nbeen somewhat embarrassed with the increase of the air's elasticity\r\nby vapor. Parrot, in 1801, proposed another theory, maintaining that\r\nDe Luc had by no means successfully attacked that of solution, but\r\nonly De Saussure's superfluous additions to it.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\10: Fischer, vol. vii. 473.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see what prevented the general reception of the\r\ndoctrine of independent vapor; since it explained all the facts very\r\nsimply, and the agency of air was shown over and over again to be\r\nunnecessary. Yet, even now, the solution of water in air is hardly\r\nexploded. M. Gay Lussac,[48\\10] in 1800, talks of the quantity of\r\nwater \"held in solution\" by the air; which, he says, varies\r\naccording to its temperature and density by a law which has not yet\r\nbeen discovered. And Professor Robison, in the article \"Steam,\" in\r\nthe _Encyclopædia Britannica_ (published about 1800), says,[49\\10]\r\n\"Many philosophers imagine that spontaneous evaporation, at low\r\ntemperatures, is produced in this way (by elasticity alone). But we\r\ncannot be of this opinion; and must still think that this kind of\r\nevaporation is produced by the dissolving power of the air.\" He then\r\ngives some reasons for his opinion. \"When moist air is suddenly\r\nrarefied, there is always a precipitation of water. But by this new\r\ndoctrine the very contrary should happen, because the tendency of\r\nwater to appear in the elastic form is promoted by removing the\r\nexternal pressure.\" Another main difficulty in the way of the\r\ndoctrine of the mere mixture of vapor and air was supposed to be\r\nthis; that if they were so mixed, the heavier fluid would take the\r\nlower part, and the lighter the higher part, of the space which they\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\10: _Ann. Chim._ tom. xliii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\10: Robison's _Works_, ii. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe former of these arguments was repelled by the consideration that\r\nin the rarefaction of air, its specific heat is changed, and thus\r\nits temperature reduced below the constituent temperature of the\r\nvapor which it contains. The latter argument is answered by a\r\nreference to Dalton's law of the mixture of gases. We must consider\r\nthe establishment of this doctrine in a new section, as the most\r\nmaterial step to the true notion of evaporation. {170}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Dalton's Doctrine of Evaporation._\r\n\r\nA PORTION of that which appears to be the true notion of evaporation\r\nwas known, with greater or less distinctness, to several of the\r\nphysical philosophers of whom we have spoken. They were aware that\r\nthe vapor which exists in air, in an invisible state, may be\r\ncondensed into water by cold: and they had noticed that, in any\r\nstate of the atmosphere, there is a certain temperature lower than\r\nthat of the atmosphere, to which, if we depress bodies, water forms\r\nupon them in fine drops like dew; this temperature is thence called\r\nthe _dew-point_. The vapor of water which exists anywhere may be\r\nreduced below the degree of heat which is necessary to constitute it\r\nvapor, and thus it ceases to be vapor. Hence this temperature is\r\nalso called the _constituent temperature_. This was generally known\r\nto the meteorological speculators of the last century, although, in\r\nEngland, attention was principally called to it by Dr. Wells's\r\n_Essay on Dew_, in 1814. This doctrine readily explains how the cold\r\nproduced by rarefaction of air, descending below the constituent\r\ntemperature of the contained vapor, may precipitate a dew; and thus,\r\nas we have said, refutes one obvious objection to the theory of\r\nindependent vapor.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty was first fully removed by Mr. Dalton. When his\r\nattention was drawn to the subject of vapor, he saw insurmountable\r\nobjections to the doctrine of a chemical union of water and air. In\r\nfact, this doctrine was a mere nominal explanation; for, on closer\r\nexamination, no chemical analogies supported it. After some\r\nreflection, and in the sequel of other generalizations concerning\r\ngases, he was led to the persuasion, that when air and steam are\r\nmixed together, each follows its separate laws of equilibrium, the\r\nparticles of each being elastic with regard to those of their own\r\nkind only: so that steam may be conceived as flowing among the\r\nparticles of air[50\\10] \"like a stream of water among pebbles;\" and\r\nthe resistance which air offers to evaporation arises, not from its\r\nweight, but from the inertia of its particles.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\10: _Manchester Memoirs_, vol. v. p. 581.]\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the theory of independent vapor, understood\r\nwith these conditions, will include all the facts of the\r\ncase;--gradual evaporation in air; sudden evaporation in a vacuum;\r\nthe increase of {171} the air's elasticity by vapor; condensation by\r\nits various causes; and other phenomena.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dalton also made experiments to prove his fundamental\r\nprinciple, that if two different gases communicate, they will\r\ndiffuse themselves through each other;[51\\10]--slowly, if the\r\nopening of communication be small. He observes also, that all the\r\ngases had equal solvent powers for vapor, which could hardly have\r\nhappened, had chemical affinity been concerned. Nor does the density\r\nof the air make any difference.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\10: _New System of Chemical Philosophy_, vol. i. p. 151.]\r\n\r\nTaking all these circumstances into the account, Mr. Dalton\r\nabandoned the idea of solution. \"In the autumn of 1801,\" he says, \"I\r\nhit upon an idea which seemed to be exactly calculated to explain\r\nthe phenomena of vapor: it gave rise to a great variety of\r\nexperiments,\" which ended in fixing it in his mind as a true idea.\r\n\"But,\" he adds, \"the theory was almost universally misunderstood,\r\nand consequently reprobated.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dalton answers various objections. Berthollet had urged that we\r\ncan hardly conceive the particles of an elastic substance added to\r\nthose of another, without increasing its elasticity. To this Mr.\r\nDalton replies by adducing the instance of magnets, which repel each\r\nother, but do not repel other bodies. One of the most curious and\r\ningenious objections is that of M. Gough, who argues, that if each\r\ngas is elastic with regard to itself alone, we should hear, produced\r\nby one stroke, four sounds; namely, _first_, the sound through\r\naqueous vapor; _second_, the sound through azotic gas; _third_, the\r\nsound through oxygen gas; _fourth_, the sound through carbonic acid.\r\nMr. Dalton's answer is, that the difference of time at which these\r\nsounds would come is very small; and that, in fact, we do hear,\r\nsounds double and treble.\r\n\r\nIn his _New System of Chemical Philosophy_, Mr. Dalton considers the\r\nobjections of his opponents with singular candor and impartiality.\r\nHe there appears disposed to abandon that part of the theory which\r\nnegatives the mutual repulsion of the particles of the two gases,\r\nand to attribute their diffusion through one another to the\r\ndifferent size of the particles, which would, he thinks,[52\\10]\r\nproduce the same effect.\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\10: _New System_, vol. i. p. 188.]\r\n\r\nIn selecting, as of permanent importance, the really valuable part\r\nof this theory, we must endeavor to leave out all that is doubtful\r\nor unproved. I believe it will be found that in all theories\r\nhitherto {172} promulgated, all assertions respecting the properties\r\nof the particles of bodies, their sizes, distances, attractions, and\r\nthe like, are insecure and superfluous. Passing over, then, such\r\nhypotheses, the inductions which remain are these;--that two gases\r\nwhich are in communication will, by the elasticity of each, diffuse\r\nthemselves in one another, quickly or slowly; and--that the quantity\r\nof steam contained in a certain space of air is the same, whatever\r\nbe the air, whatever be its density, and even if there be a vacuum.\r\nThese propositions may be included together by saying, that one gas\r\nis _mechanically mixed_ with another; and we cannot but assent to\r\nwhat Mr. Dalton says of the latter fact,--\"this is certainly the\r\ntouchstone of the mechanical and chemical theories.\" This _doctrine\r\nof the mechanical mixture of gases_ appears to supply answers to all\r\nthe difficulties opposed to it by Berthollet and others, as Mr.\r\nDalton has shown;[53\\10] and we may, therefore, accept it as well\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\10: _New System_, vol. i. p. 160, &c.]\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, along with the _principle of the constituent\r\ntemperature of steam_, is applicable to a large series of\r\nmeteorological and other consequences. But before considering the\r\napplications of theory to natural phenomena, which have been made,\r\nit will be proper to speak of researches which were carried on, in a\r\ngreat measure, in consequence of the use of steam in the arts: I\r\nmean the laws which connect its elastic force with its constituent\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Determination of the Laws of the Elastic Force of\r\nSteam._\r\n\r\nTHE expansion of aqueous vapor at different temperatures is\r\ngoverned, like that of all other vapors, by the law of Dalton and\r\nGay-Lussac, already mentioned; and from this, its elasticity, when\r\nits expansion is resisted, will be known by the law of Boyle and\r\nMariotte; namely, by the rule that the pressure of airy fluids is as\r\nthe condensation. But it is to be observed, that this process of\r\ncalculation goes on the supposition that the steam is cut off from\r\ncontact with water, so that no more steam can be generated; a case\r\nquite different from the common one, in which the steam is more\r\nabundant as the heat is greater. The examination of the force of\r\nvapor, when it is in contact with water, must be briefly noticed.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of which we have been speaking, the progress of\r\nthe investigation of the laws of aqueous vapor was much accelerated\r\n{173} by the growing importance of the steam-engine, in which those\r\nlaws operated in a practical form. James Watts, the main improver of\r\nthat machine, was thus a great contributor to speculative knowledge,\r\nas well as to practical power. Many of his improvements depended on\r\nthe laws which regulate the quantity of heat which goes to the\r\nformation or condensation of steam; and the observations which led\r\nto these improvements enter into the induction of latent heat.\r\nMeasurements of the force of steam, at all temperatures, were made\r\nwith the same view. Watts's attention had been drawn to the\r\nsteam-engine in 1759, by Robison, the former being then an\r\ninstrument-maker, and the latter a student at the University of\r\nGlasgow.[54\\10] In 1761 or 1762, he tried some experiments on the\r\nforce of steam in a Papin's Digester;[55\\10] and formed a sort of\r\nworking model of a steam-engine, feeling already his vocation to\r\ndevelope the powers of that invention. His knowledge was at that\r\ntime principally derived from Desaguliers and Belidor, but his own\r\nexperiments added to it rapidly. In 1764 and 1765, he made a more\r\nsystematical course of experiments, directed to ascertain the force\r\nof steam. He tried this force, however, only at temperatures above\r\nthe boiling-point; and inferred it at lower degrees from the\r\nsupposed continuity of the law thus obtained. His friend Robison,\r\nalso, was soon after led, by reading the account of some experiments\r\nof Lord Charles Cavendish, and some others of Mr. Nairne, to examine\r\nthe same subject. He made out a table of the correspondence of the\r\nelasticity and the temperature of vapor, from thirty-two to two\r\nhundred and eighty degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.[56\\10] The\r\nthing here to be remarked, is the establishment of a law of the\r\npressure of steam, down to the freezing-point of water. Ziegler of\r\nBasle, in 1769, and Achard of Berlin, in 1782, made similar\r\nexperiments. The latter examined also the elasticity of the vapor of\r\nalcohol. Betancourt, in 1792, published his Memoir on the expansive\r\nforce of vapors; and his tables were for some time considered the\r\nmost exact. {174} Prony, in his _Architecture Hydraulique_ (1796),\r\nestablished a mathematical formula,[57\\10] on the experiments of\r\nBetancourt, who began his researches in the belief that he was first\r\nin the field, although he afterwards found that he had been\r\nanticipated by Ziegler. Gren compared the experiments of Betancourt\r\nand De Luc with his own. He ascertained an important fact, that when\r\nwater _boils_, the elasticity of the steam is equal to that of the\r\natmosphere. Schmidt at Giessen endeavored to improve the apparatus\r\nused by Betancourt; and Biker, of Rotterdam, in 1800, made new\r\ntrials for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\10: Robison's _Works_, vol. ii. p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\10: Denis Papin, who made many of Boyle's experiments for\r\nhim, had discovered that if the vapor be prevented from rising, the\r\nwater becomes hotter than the usual boiling-point; and had hence\r\ninvented the instrument called _Papin's Digester_. It is described\r\nin his book, _La manière d'amolir les os et de faire cuire toutes\r\nsorts de viandes en fort peu de temps et à peu de frais_. Paris,\r\n1682.]\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\10: These were afterwards published in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_; in the article \"Steam,\" written by Robison.]\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\10: _Architecture Hydraulique_, Seconde Partie, p. 163.]\r\n\r\nIn 1801, Mr. Dalton communicated to the Philosophical Society of\r\nManchester his investigations on this subject; observing truly, that\r\nthough the forces at high temperatures are most important when steam\r\nis considered as a mechanical agent, the progress of philosophy is\r\nmore immediately interested in accurate observations on the force at\r\nlow temperatures. He also found that his elasticities for\r\nequidistant temperatures resembled a _geometrical progression_, but\r\nwith a ratio constantly diminishing. Dr. Ure, in 1818, published in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ of London, experiments of the same\r\nkind, valuable from the high temperatures at which they were made,\r\nand for the simplicity of his apparatus. The law which he thus\r\nobtained approached, like Dalton's, to a _geometrical progression_.\r\nDr. Ure says, that a formula proposed by M. Biot gives an error of\r\nnear nine inches out of seventy-five, at a temperature of 266\r\ndegrees. This is very conceivable, for if the formula be wrong at\r\nall, the geometrical progress rapidly inflames the error in the\r\nhigher portions of the scale. The elasticity of steam, at high\r\ntemperatures, has also been experimentally examined by Mr. Southern,\r\nof Soho, and Mr. Sharpe, of Manchester. Mr. Dalton has attempted to\r\ndeduce certain general laws from Mr. Sharpe's experiments; and other\r\npersons have offered other rules, as those which govern the force of\r\nsteam with reference to the temperature: but no rule appears yet to\r\nhave assumed the character of an established scientific truth. Yet\r\nthe law of the expansive force of steam is not only required in\r\norder that the steam-engine may be employed with safety and to the\r\nbest advantage; but must also be an important point in every\r\nconsistent thermotical theory.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [To the experiments on steam made by private physicists,\r\nare to be added the experiments made on a grand scale by order of\r\nthe governments of France and of America, with a view to {175}\r\nlegislation on the subject of steam-engines. The French experiments\r\nwere made in 1823, under the direction of a commission consisting of\r\nsome of the most distinguished members of the Academy of Sciences;\r\nnamely, MM. de Prony, Arago, Girard, and Dulong. The American\r\nexperiments were placed in the hands of a committee of the Franklin\r\nInstitute of the State of Pennsylvania, consisting of Prof. Bache\r\nand others, in 1830. The French experiments went as high as 435° of\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer, corresponding to a pressure of 60 feet of\r\nmercury, or 24 atmospheres. The American experiments were made up to\r\na temperature of 346°, which corresponded to 274 inches of mercury,\r\nmore than 9 atmospheres. The extensive range of these experiments\r\naffords great advantages for determining the law of the expansive\r\nforce. The French Academy found that their experiments indicated an\r\nincrease of the elastic force according to the _fifth_ power of a\r\nbinominal 1 + _mt_, where _t_ is the temperature. The American\r\nInstitute were led to a _sixth_ power of a like binominal. Other\r\nexperimenters have expressed their results, not by powers of the\r\ntemperature, but by geometrical ratios. Dr. Dalton had supposed that\r\nthe expansion of mercury being as the square of the true temperature\r\nabove its freezing-point, the expansive force of steam increases in\r\ngeometrical ratio for equal increments of temperature. And the\r\nauthor of the article _Steam_ in the Seventh Edition of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_ (Mr. J. S. Russell), has found that the\r\nexperiments are best satisfied by supposing mercury, as well as\r\nsteam, to expand in a geometrical ratio for equal increments of the\r\ntrue temperature.\r\n\r\nIt appears by such calculation, that while dry gas increases in the\r\nratio of 8 to 11, by an increase of temperature from freezing to\r\nboiling water; steam in contact with water, by the same increase of\r\ntemperature above boiling water, has its expansive force increased\r\nin the proportion of 1 to 12. By an equal increase of temperature,\r\nmercury expands in about the ratio of 8 to 9.\r\n\r\nRecently, MM. Magnus of Berlin, Holzmann and Regnault, have made\r\nseries of observations on the relation between temperature and\r\nelasticity of steam.[58\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\10: See Taylor's _Scientific Memoirs_, Aug. 1845, vol. iv.\r\npart xiv., and _Ann. de Chimie_.]\r\n\r\nProf. Magnus measured his temperatures by an air-thermometer; a\r\nprocess which, I stated in the first edition, seemed to afford the\r\nbest promise of simplifying the law of expansion. His result is,\r\nthat the {176} elasticity proceeds in a geometric series when the\r\ntemperature proceeds in an arithmetical series nearly; the\r\ndifferences of temperature for equal augmentations of the ratio of\r\nelasticity being somewhat greater for the higher temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe forces of the vapors of other liquids in contact with their\r\nliquids, determined by Dr. Faraday, as mentioned in Chap. ii. Sect.\r\n1, are analogous to the elasticity of steam here spoken of.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Consequences of the Doctrine of\r\nEvaporation.--Explanation of Rain, Dew, and Clouds._\r\n\r\nTHE discoveries concerning the relations of heat and moisture which\r\nwere made during the last century, were principally suggested by\r\nmeteorological inquiries, and were applied to meteorology as fast as\r\nthey rose. Still there remains, on many points of this subject, so\r\nmuch doubt and obscurity, that we cannot suppose the doctrines to\r\nhave assumed their final form; and therefore we are not here called\r\nupon to trace their progress and connexion. The principles of\r\natmology are pretty well understood; but the difficulty of observing\r\nthe conditions under which they produce their effects in the\r\natmosphere is so great, that the precise theory of most\r\nmeteorological phenomena is still to be determined.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered the answers given to the question:\r\nAccording to what rules does transparent aqueous vapor resume its\r\nform of visible water? This question includes, not only the problems\r\nof Rain and Dew, but also of Clouds; for clouds are not vapor, but\r\nwater, vapor being always invisible. An opinion which attracted much\r\nnotice in its time, was that of Hutton, who, in 1784, endeavored to\r\nprove that if two masses of air saturated with transparent vapor at\r\ndifferent temperatures are mixed together, the precipitation of\r\nwater in the form either of cloud or of drops will take place. The\r\nreason he assigned for the opinion was this: that the temperature of\r\nthe mixture is a mean between the two temperatures, but that the\r\nforce of the vapor in the mixture, which is the mean of the forces\r\nof the two component vapors, will be greater than that which\r\ncorresponds to the mean temperature, since the force increases\r\nfaster than the temperature;[59\\10] and hence some part of the vapor\r\nwill be precipitated. This doctrine, it will be seen, speaks of\r\nvapor as \"saturating\" air, and is {177} therefore, in this form,\r\ninconsistent with Dalton's principle; but it is not difficult to\r\nmodify the expression so as to retain the essential part of the\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\10: _Edin. Trans._ vol. 1. p. 42.]\r\n\r\n_Dew._--The principle of a \"constituent temperature\" of steam, and\r\nthe explanation of the \"dew-point,\" were known, as we have said\r\n(chap. iii. sect. 3,) to the meteorologists of the last century; but\r\nwe perceive how incomplete their knowledge was, by the very gradual\r\nmanner in which the consequences of this principle were traced out.\r\nWe have already noticed, as one of the books which most drew\r\nattention to the true doctrine, in this country at least, Dr.\r\nWells's _Essay on Dew_, published in 1814. In this work the author\r\ngives an account of the progress of his opinions;[60\\10] \"I was\r\nled,\" he says, \"in the autumn of 1784, by the event of a rude\r\nexperiment, to think it probable that the formation of dew is\r\nattended with the production of cold.\" This was confirmed by the\r\nexperiments of others. But some years after, \"upon considering the\r\nsubject more closely, I began to suspect that Mr. Wilson, Mr. Six,\r\nand myself, had all committed an error in regarding the cold which\r\naccompanies the dew, as an _effect_ of the formation of the dew.\" He\r\nnow considered it rather as the _cause_: and soon found that he was\r\nable to account for the circumstances of this formation, many of\r\nthem curious and paradoxical, by supposing the bodies on which dew\r\nis deposited, to be cooled down, by radiation into the clear\r\nnight-sky, to the proper temperature. The same principle will\r\nobviously explain the formation of mists over streams and lakes when\r\nthe air is cooler than the water; which was put forward by Davy,\r\neven in 1810, as a new doctrine, or at least not familiar.\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\10: _Essay on Dew_, p. 1.]\r\n\r\n_Hygrometers._--According as air has more or less of vapor in\r\ncomparison with that which its temperature and pressure enable it to\r\ncontain, it is more or less humid; and an instrument which measures\r\nthe degrees of such a gradation is a _hygrometer_. The hygrometers\r\nwhich were at first invented, were those which measured the moisture\r\nby its effect in producing expansion or contraction in certain\r\norganic substances; thus De Saussure devised a hair-hygrometer, De\r\nLuc a whalebone-hygrometer, and Dalton used a piece of whipcord. All\r\nthese contrivances were variable in the amount of their indications\r\nunder the same circumstances; and, moreover, it was not easy to know\r\nthe physical meaning of the degree indicated. The dew-point, or\r\nconstituent temperature of the vapor which exists in the air, is, on\r\n{178} the other hand, both constant and definite. The determination\r\nof this point, as a datum for the moisture of the atmosphere, was\r\nemployed by Le Roi, and by Dalton (1802), the condensation being\r\nobtained by cold water:[61\\10] and finally, Mr. Daniell (1812)\r\nconstructed an instrument, where the condensing temperature was\r\nproduced by evaporation of ether, in a very convenient manner. This\r\ninvention (_Daniell's Hygrometer_) enables us to determine the\r\nquantity of vapor which exists in a given mass of the atmosphere at\r\nany time of observation.\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\10: Daniell, _Met. Ess._ p. 142. _Manch. Mem._ vol. v.\r\np. 581.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [As a happy application of the Atmological Laws which have\r\nbeen discovered, I may mention the completion of the theory and use\r\nof the _Wet-bulb Hygrometer_; an instrument in which, from the\r\ndepression of temperature produced by wetting the bulb of a\r\nthermometer, we infer the further depression which would produce\r\ndew. Of this instrument the history is thus summed up by Prof.\r\nForbes:--\"Hutton invented the method; Leslie revived and extended\r\nit, giving probably the earliest, though an imperfect theory;\r\nGay-Lussac, by his excellent experiments and reasoning from them,\r\ncompleted the theory, so far as perfectly dry air is concerned;\r\nIvory extended the theory; which was reduced to practice by Auguste\r\nand Bohnenberger, who determined the constant with accuracy. English\r\nobservers have done little more than confirm the conclusions of our\r\nindustrious Germanic neighbors; nevertheless the experiments of\r\nApjohn and Prinsep must ever be considered as conclusively settling\r\nthe value of the coefficient near the one extremity of the scale, as\r\nthose of Kæmtz have done for the other.\"[62\\10]\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\10: _Second Report on Meteorology_, p. 101.]\r\n\r\nProf. Forbes's two Reports _On the Recent Progress and Present State\r\nof Meteorology_ given among the _Reports of the British Association_\r\nfor 1832 and 1840, contain a complete and luminous account of recent\r\nresearches on this subject. It may perhaps be asked why I have not\r\ngiven Meteorology a place among the Inductive Sciences; but if the\r\nreader refers to these accounts, or any other adequate view of the\r\nsubject, he will see that Meteorology is not a single Inductive\r\nScience, but the application of several sciences to the explanation\r\nof terrestrial and atmospheric phenomena. Of the sciences so\r\napplied, Thermotics and Atmology are the principal ones. But others\r\nalso come into play; as Optics, in the explanation of Rainbows,\r\nHalos, {179} Parhelia, Coronæ, Glories, and the like; Electricity,\r\nin the explanation of Thunder and Lightning, Hail, Aurora Borealis;\r\nto which others might be added.]\r\n\r\n_Clouds._--When vapor becomes visible by being cooled below its\r\nconstituent temperature, it forms itself into a very fine watery\r\npowder, the diameter of the particles of which this powder consists\r\nbeing very small: they are estimated by various writers, from\r\n1⁄100,000th to 1⁄20,000th of an inch.[63\\10] Such particles, even if\r\nsolid, would descend very slowly; and very slight causes would\r\nsuffice for their suspension, without recurring to the hypothesis of\r\nvesicles, of which we have already spoken. Indeed that hypothesis\r\nwill not explain the fact, except we suppose these vesicles filled\r\nwith a rarer air than that of the atmosphere; and, accordingly,\r\nthough this hypothesis is still maintained by some,[64\\10] it is\r\nasserted as a fact of observation, proved by optical or other\r\nphenomena, and not deduced from the suspension of clouds. Yet the\r\nlatter result is still variously explained by different\r\nphilosophers: thus, M. Gay-Lussac[65\\10] accounts for it by upward\r\ncurrents of air, and Fresnel explains it by the heat and rarefaction\r\nof air in the interior of the cloud.\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\10: Kæmtz, _Met._ i. 393.]\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\10: Ib. i. 393. Robison, ii. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\10: _Ann. Chim._ xxv. 1822.]\r\n\r\n_Classification of Clouds._--A classification of clouds can then\r\nonly be consistent and intelligible when it rests upon their\r\natmological conditions. Such a system was proposed by Mr. Luke\r\nHoward, in 1802-3. His primary modifications are, _Cirrus_,\r\n_Cumulus_, and _Stratus_, which the Germans have translated by terms\r\nequivalent in English to _feather-cloud_, _heap-cloud_, and\r\n_layer-cloud_. The cumulus increases by accumulations on its top,\r\nand floats in the air with a horizontal base; the stratus grows from\r\nbelow, and spreads along the earth; the cirrus consists of fibres in\r\nthe higher regions of the atmosphere, which grow every way. Between\r\nthe simple modifications are intermediate ones, _cirro-cumulus_ and\r\n_cirro-stratus_; and, again, compound ones, the _cumulo-stratus_ and\r\nthe _nimbus_, or _rain-cloud_. These distinctions have been\r\ngenerally accepted all over Europe: and have rendered a description\r\nof all the processes which go on in the atmosphere far more definite\r\nand clear than it could be made before their use.\r\n\r\nI omit a mass of facts and opinions, supposed laws of phenomena and\r\nassigned causes, which abound in meteorology more than in any other\r\nscience. The slightest consideration will show us what a great {180}\r\namount of labor, of persevering and combined observation, the\r\nprogress of this branch of knowledge requires. I do not even speak\r\nof the condition of the more elevated parts of the atmosphere. The\r\ndiminution of temperature as we ascend, one of the most marked of\r\natmospheric facts, has been variously explained by different\r\nwriters. Thus Dalton[66\\10] (1808) refers it to a principle \"that\r\neach atom of air, in the same perpendicular column, is possessed of\r\nthe same degree of heat,\" which principle he conceives to be\r\nentirely empirical in this case. Fourier says[67\\10] (1817), \"This\r\nphenomenon results from several causes: one of the principal is the\r\nprogressive extinction of the rays of heat in the successive strata\r\nof the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\10: _New Syst. of Chem._ vol. i. p. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\10: _Ann. Chim._ vi. 285.]\r\n\r\nLeaving, therefore, the application of thermotical and atmological\r\nprinciples in particular cases, let us consider for a moment the\r\ngeneral views to which they have led philosophers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL THEORIES OF HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN we look at the condition of that branch of knowledge which,\r\naccording to the phraseology already employed, we must call _Physical\r\nThermotics_, in opposition to Formal Thermotics, which gives us\r\ndetached laws of phenomena, we find the prospect very different from\r\nthat which was presented to us by physical astronomy, optics, and\r\nacoustics. In these sciences, the maintainers of a distinct and\r\ncomprehensive theory have professed at least to show that it\r\nexplains and includes the principal laws of phenomena of various\r\nkinds; in Thermotics, we have only attempts to explain a part of the\r\nfacts. We have here no example of an hypothesis which, assumed in\r\norder to explain one class of phenomena, has been found also to\r\naccount exactly for another; as when central forces led to the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, or when the explanation of polarization\r\nexplained also double refraction; or when the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, as measured by the barometer, gave the true velocity of\r\nsound. Such coincidences, or _consiliences_, as I have elsewhere\r\ncalled them, are the test of truth; and thermotical theories cannot\r\nyet exhibit credentials of this kind. {181}\r\n\r\nOn looking back at our view of this science, it will be seen that it\r\nmay be distinguished into two parts; the Doctrines of Conduction and\r\nRadiation, which we call Thermotics proper; and the Doctrines\r\nrespecting the relation of Heat, Airs, and Moisture, which we have\r\ntermed Atmology. These two subjects differ in their bearing on our\r\nhypothetical views.\r\n\r\n_Thermotical Theories._--The phenomena of radiant heat, like those\r\nof radiant light, obviously admit of general explanation in two\r\ndifferent ways;--by the emission of material particles, or by the\r\npropagation of undulations. Both these opinions have found\r\nsupporters. Probably most persons, in adopting Prevost's theory of\r\nexchanges, conceive the radiation of heat to be the radiation of\r\nmatter. The undulation hypothesis, on the other hand, appears to be\r\nsuggested by the production of heat by friction, and was accordingly\r\nmaintained by Rumford and others. Leslie[68\\10] appears, in a great\r\npart of his _Inquiry_, to be a supporter of some undulatory\r\ndoctrine, but it is extremely difficult to make out what his\r\nundulating medium is; or rather, his opinions wavered during his\r\nprogress. In page 31, he asks, \"What is this calorific and\r\nfrigorific fluid? and after keeping the reader in suspense for a\r\nmoment, he replies,\r\n  \"Quod petis hic est.\r\nIt is merely the ambient AIR.\" But at page 150, he again asks the\r\nquestion, and, at page 188, he answers, \"It is the same subtile\r\nmatter that, according to its different modes of existence,\r\nconstitutes either heat or light.\" A person thus vacillating between\r\ntwo opinions, one of which is palpably false, and the other laden\r\nwith exceeding difficulties which he does not even attempt to\r\nremove, had little right to protest against[69\\10] \"the sportive\r\nfreaks of some intangible _aura_;\" to rank all other hypotheses than\r\nhis own with the \"occult qualities of the schools;\" and to class the\r\n\"prejudices\" of his opponents with the tenets of those who\r\nmaintained the _fuga vacui_ in opposition to Torricelli. It is worth\r\nwhile noticing this kind of rhetoric, in order to observe, that it\r\nmay be used just as easily on the wrong side as on the right.\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\10: _An Experimental Inquiry into the Nature and\r\nPropagation of Heat_, 1804.]\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\10: Ib. p. 47.]\r\n\r\nTill recently, the theory of material heat, and of its propagation\r\nby emission, was probably the one most in favor with those who had\r\nstudied mathematical thermotics. As we have said, the laws of {182}\r\nconduction, in their ultimate analytical form, were almost identical\r\nwith the laws of motion of fluids. Fourier's principle also, that\r\nthe radiation of heat takes place from points below the surface, and\r\nis intercepted by the superficial particles, appears to favor the\r\nnotion of material emission.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, some of the most eminent modern French mathematicians\r\nhave accepted and extended the hypothesis of a material caloric. In\r\naddition to Fourier's doctrine of molecular extra-radiation, Laplace\r\nand Poisson have maintained the hypothesis of _molecular\r\nintra-radiation_, as the mode in which conduction takes place; that\r\nis, they say that the particles of bodies are to be considered as\r\n_discrete_, or as points separated from each other, and acting on\r\neach other at a distance; and the conduction of heat from one part\r\nto another, is performed by radiation between all neighboring\r\nparticles. They hold that, without this hypothesis, the differential\r\nequations expressing the conditions of conduction cannot be made\r\nhomogeneous: but this assertion rests, I conceive, on an error, as\r\nFourier has shown, by dispensing with the hypothesis. The necessity\r\nof the hypothesis of discrete molecular action in bodies, is\r\nmaintained in all cases by M. Poisson; and he has asserted Laplace's\r\ntheory of capillary attraction to be defective on this ground, as\r\nLaplace asserted Fourier's reasoning respecting heat to be so. In\r\nreality, however, this hypothesis of discrete molecules cannot be\r\nmaintained as a physical truth; for the law of molecular action,\r\nwhich is assumed in the reasoning, after answering its purpose in\r\nthe progress of calculation, vanishes in the result; the conclusion\r\nis the same, whatever law of the intervals of the molecules be\r\nassumed. The definite integral, which expresses the whole action, no\r\nmore proves that this action is actually made of the differential\r\nparts by means of which it was found, than the processes of finding\r\nthe weight of a body by integration, prove it to be made up of\r\ndifferential weights. And therefore, even if we were to adopt the\r\nemission theory of heat, we are by no means bound to take along with\r\nit the hypothesis of discrete molecules.\r\n\r\nBut the recent discovery of the refraction, polarization, and\r\ndepolarization of heat, has quite altered the theoretical aspect of\r\nthe subject, and, almost at a single blow, ruined the emission\r\ntheory. Since heat is reflected and refracted like light, analogy\r\nwould lead us to conclude that the mechanism of the processes is the\r\nsame in the two cases. And when we add to these properties the\r\nproperty of polarization, it is scarcely possible to believe\r\notherwise than that heat consists in {183} transverse vibrations;\r\nfor no wise philosopher would attempt an explanation by ascribing\r\npoles to the emitted particles, after the experience which Optics\r\naffords, of the utter failure of such machinery.\r\n\r\nBut here the question occurs, If heat consists in vibrations, whence\r\narises the extraordinary identity of the laws of its propagation\r\nwith the laws of the flow of matter? How is it that, in conducted\r\nheat, this vibration creeps slowly from one part of the body to\r\nanother, the part first heated remaining hottest; instead of leaving\r\nits first place and travelling rapidly to another, as the vibrations\r\nof sound and light do? The answer to these questions has been put in\r\na very distinct and plausible form by that distinguished\r\nphilosopher, M. Ampère, who published a _Note on Heat and Light\r\nconsidered as the results of Vibratory Motion_,[70\\10] in 1834 and\r\n1835; and though this answer is an hypothesis, it at least shows\r\nthat there is no fatal force in the difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\10: _Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève_, vol. xlix. p.\r\n225. _Ann. Chim._ tom. lvii. p. 434.]\r\n\r\nM. Ampère's hypothesis is this; that bodies consist of solid\r\nmolecules, which may be considered as arranged at intervals in a\r\nvery rare ether; and that the vibrations of the molecules, causing\r\nvibrations of the ether and caused by them, constitute heat. On\r\nthese suppositions, we should have the phenomena of conduction\r\nexplained; for if the molecules at one end of a bar be hot, and\r\ntherefore in a state of vibration, while the others are at rest, the\r\nvibrating molecules propagate vibrations in the ether, but these\r\nvibrations do not produce heat, except in proportion as they put the\r\nquiescent molecules of the bar in vibration; and the ether being\r\nvery rare compared with the molecules, it is only by the repeated\r\nimpulses of many successive vibrations that the nearest quiescent\r\nmolecules are made to vibrate; after which they combine in\r\ncommunicating the vibration to the more remote molecules. \"We then\r\nfind necessarily,\" M. Ampère adds, \"the same equations as those\r\nfound by Fourier for the distribution of heat, setting out from the\r\nsame hypothesis, that the temperature or heat transmitted is\r\nproportional to the difference of the temperatures.\"\r\n\r\nSince the undulatory hypothesis of heat can thus answer all obvious\r\nobjections, we may consider it as upon its trial, to be confirmed or\r\nmodified by future discoveries; and especially by an enlarged\r\nknowledge of the laws of the polarization of heat.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Since the first edition was written, the analogies\r\nbetween light and heat have been further extended, as I have already\r\nstated. It {184} has been discovered by MM. Biot and Melloni that\r\nquartz impresses a circular polarization upon heat; and by Prof.\r\nForbes that mica, of a certain thickness, produces phenomena such as\r\nwould be produced by the impression of circular polarization of the\r\nsupposed transversal vibrations of radiant heat; and further, a\r\nrhomb of rock-salt, of the shape of the glass rhomb which verified\r\nFresnel's extraordinary anticipation of the circular polarization of\r\nlight, verified the expectation, founded upon other analogies, of\r\nthe polarization of heat. By passing polarized heat through various\r\nthicknesses of mica, Prof. Forbes has attempted to calculate the\r\nlength of an undulation for heat.\r\n\r\nThese analogies cannot fail to produce a strong disposition to\r\nbelieve that light and heat, essences so closely connected that they\r\ncan hardly be separated, and thus shown to have so many curious\r\nproperties in common, are propagated by the same machinery; and thus\r\nwe are led to an Undulatory Theory of Heat.\r\n\r\nYet such a Theory has not yet by any means received full\r\nconfirmation. It depends upon the analogy and the connexion of the\r\nTheory of Light, and would have little weight if those were removed.\r\nFor the separation of the rays in double refraction, and the\r\nphenomena of periodical intensity, the two classes of facts out of\r\nwhich the Undulatory Theory of Optics principally grew, have neither\r\nof them been detected in thermotical experiments. Prof. Forbes has\r\nassumed alternations of heat for increasing thicknesses of mica, but\r\nin his experiments we find only one _maximum_. The occurrence of\r\nalternate maxima and minima under the like circumstances would\r\nexhibit visible waves of heat, as the fringes of shadows do of\r\nlight, and would thus add much to the evidence of the theory.\r\n\r\nEven if I conceived the Undulatory Theory of Heat to be now\r\nestablished, I should not venture, as yet, to describe its\r\nestablishment as an event in the history of the Inductive Sciences.\r\nIt is only at an interval of time after such events have taken place\r\nthat their history and character can be fully understood, so as to\r\nsuggest lessons in the Philosophy of Science.]\r\n\r\n_Atmological Theories._--Hypotheses of the relations of heat and air\r\nalmost necessarily involve a reference to the forces by which the\r\ncomposition of bodies is produced, and thus cannot properly be\r\ntreated of, till we have surveyed the condition of chemical\r\nknowledge. But we may say a few words on one such hypothesis; I mean\r\nthe hypothesis on the subject of the atmological laws of heat,\r\nproposed by Laplace, in the twelfth Book of the _Mécanique Céléste_,\r\nand published in 1823. {185} It will be recollected that the main\r\nlaws of phenomena for which we have to account, by means of such an\r\nhypothesis, are the following:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The law of Boyle and Mariotte, that the elasticity of an air\r\nvaries as its density. See Chap. iii., Sect. 1 of this Book.\r\n\r\n(2.) The Law of Gay-Lussac and Dalton, that all airs expand equally\r\nby heat. See Chap. ii. Sect. 1.\r\n\r\n(3.) The production of heat by sudden compression. See Chap. ii.\r\nSect. 2.\r\n\r\n(4.) Dalton's principle of the mechanical mixture of airs. See Chap.\r\niii. Sect. 3.\r\n\r\n(5.) The Law of expansion of solids and fluids by heat. See Chap.\r\nii. Sect. 1.\r\n\r\n(6.) Changes of consistence by heat, and the doctrine of latent\r\nheat. See Chap. ii. Sect. 3.\r\n\r\n(7.) The Law of the expansive force of steam. See Chap. iii. Sect. 4.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are laws of which it is doubtful whether they\r\nare or are not included in the preceding, as the low temperature of\r\nthe air in the higher parts of the atmosphere. (See Chap. iii.\r\nSect. 5.)\r\n\r\nLaplace's hypothesis[71\\10] is this:--that bodies consist of\r\nparticles, each of which gathers round it, by its attraction, a\r\nquantity of caloric: that the particles of the bodies attract each\r\nother, besides attracting the caloric, and that the particles of the\r\ncaloric repel each other.\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\10: _Méc. Cél._ t. v. p. 89.]\r\n\r\nIn gases, the particles of the bodies are so far removed, that their\r\nmutual attraction is insensible, and the matter tends to expand by\r\nthe mutual repulsion of the caloric. He conceives this caloric to be\r\nconstantly radiating among the particles; the density of this\r\ninternal radiation is the _temperature_, and he proves that, on this\r\nsupposition, the elasticity of the air will be as the density, and\r\nas this temperature. Hence follow the three first rules above\r\nstated. The same suppositions lead to Dalton's principle of mixtures\r\n(4), though without involving his mode of conception; for Laplace\r\nsays that whatever the mutual action of two gases be, the whole\r\npressure will be equal to the sum of the separate pressures.[72\\10]\r\nExpansion (5), and the changes of consistence (6), are explained by\r\nsupposing[73\\10] that in solids, the mutual attraction of the\r\nparticles of the body is the greatest force; in liquids, the\r\nattraction of the particles for the caloric; in airs, the repulsion\r\nof {186} the caloric. But the doctrine of latent heat again\r\nmodifies[74\\10] the hypothesis, and makes it necessary to include\r\nlatent heat in the calculation; yet there is not, as we might\r\nsuppose there would be if the theory were the true one, any\r\nconfirmation of the hypothesis resulting from the new class of laws\r\nthus referred to. Nor does it appear that the hypothesis accounts\r\nfor the relation between the elasticity and the temperature of steam.\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\10: Ib. p. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\10: Ib. p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\10: _Méc. Cél._ t. v. p. 93.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Laplace's hypothesis goes entirely upon the\r\nmateriality of heat, and is inconsistent with any vibratory theory;\r\nfor, as Ampère remarks, \"It is clear that if we admit heat to\r\nconsist in vibrations, it is a contradiction to attribute to heat\r\n(or caloric) a repulsive force of the particles which would be a\r\ncause of vibration.\"\r\n\r\nAn unfavorable judgment of Laplace's Theory of Gases is suggested by\r\nlooking for that which, in speaking of Optics, was mentioned as the\r\ngreat characteristic of a true theory; namely, that the hypotheses,\r\nwhich were assumed in order to account for one class of facts, are\r\nfound to explain another class of a different nature:--the consilience\r\nof inductions. Thus, in thermotics, the law of an intensity of\r\nradiation proportional to the sine of the angle of the ray with the\r\nsurface, which is founded on direct experiments of radiation, is found\r\nto be necessary in order to explain the tendency of neighboring bodies\r\nto equality of temperature; and this leads to the higher\r\ngeneralization, that heat is radiant from points below the surface.\r\nBut in the doctrine of the relation of heat to gases, as delivered by\r\nLaplace, there is none of this unexpected confirmation; and though he\r\nexplains some of the leading laws, his assumptions bear a large\r\nproportion to the laws explained. Thus, from the assumption that the\r\nrepulsion of gases arises from the mutual repulsion of the particles\r\nof caloric, he finds that the pressure in any gas is as the square of\r\nthe density and of the quantity of caloric;[75\\10] and from the\r\nassumption that the temperature is the internal radiation, he finds\r\nthat this temperature is as the density and the square of the\r\ncaloric.[76\\10] Hence he obtains the law of Boyle and Mariotte, and\r\nthat of Dalton and Gay-Lussac. But this view of the subject requires\r\nother assumptions when we come to latent heat; and accordingly, he\r\nintroduces, to express the latent heat, a new quantity.[77\\10] Yet\r\nthis quantity produces no effect on his calculations, nor does he\r\napply his reasoning to any problem in which latent heat is concerned.\r\n{187}\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\10: P = 2 π H K ρ^2_c_^2 (1) p. 107.]\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\10: _q_' Π (_a_) = ρ_c_^2 (2) p. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\10: The quantity _i_, p. 113.]\r\n\r\nWithout, then, deciding upon this theory, we may venture to say that\r\nit is wanting in all the prominent and striking characteristics\r\nwhich we have found in those great theories which we look upon as\r\nclearly and indisputably established.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--We may observe, moreover, that heat has other\r\nbearings and effects, which, as soon as they have been analysed into\r\nnumerical laws of phenomena, must be attended to in the formation of\r\nthermotical theories. Chemistry will probably supply many such;\r\nthose which occur to us, we must examine hereafter. But we may\r\nmention as examples of such, MM. De la Rive and Marcet's law, that\r\nthe specific heat of all gases is the same;[78\\10] and MM. Dulong\r\nand Petit's law, that single atoms of all simple bodies have the\r\nsame capacity for heat.[79\\10] Though we have not yet said anything\r\nof the relation of different gases, or explained the meaning of\r\n_atoms_ in the chemical sense, it will easily be conceived that\r\nthese are very general and important propositions.\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\10: _Ann. Chim._ xxxv. (1827.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\10: Ib. x. 397.]\r\n\r\nThus the science of Thermotics, imperfect as it is, forms a\r\nhighly-instructive part of our survey; and is one of the cardinal\r\npoints on which the doors of those chambers of physical knowledge\r\nmust turn which hitherto have remained closed. For, on the one hand,\r\nthis science is related by strong analogies and dependencies to the\r\nmost complete portions of our knowledge, our mechanical doctrines\r\nand optical theories; and on the other, it is connected with\r\nproperties and laws of a nature altogether different,--those of\r\nchemistry; properties and laws depending upon a new system of\r\nnotions and relations, among which clear and substantial general\r\nprinciples are far more difficult to lay hold of and with which the\r\nfuture progress of human knowledge appears to be far more concerned.\r\nTo these notions and relations we must now proceed; but we shall\r\nfind an intermediate stage, in certain subjects which I shall call\r\nthe _Mechanico-chemical_ Sciences; viz., those which have to do with\r\nMagnetism, Electricity, and Galvanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{189}}\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MECHANICO-CHEMICAL SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARVA metu primo: mox sese extollit in auras,\r\n  Ingrediturque solo, et caput inter nubila condit.\r\n          _Æn._ iv. 176.\r\n\r\n  A timid breath at first, a transient touch,\r\n  How soon it swells from little into much!\r\n  Runs o'er the ground, and springs into the air,\r\n  And fills the tempest's gloom, the lightning's glare;\r\n  While denser darkness than the central storm\r\n  Conceals the secrets of its inward form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{191}}\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n_Of the Mechanico-Chemical Sciences._\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER the title of Mechanico-Chemical Sciences, I include the laws\r\nof Magnetism, Electricity, Galvanism, and the other classes of\r\nphenomena closely related to these, as Thermo-electricity. This\r\ngroup of subjects forms a curious and interesting portion of our\r\nphysical knowledge; and not the least of the circumstances which\r\ngive them their interest, is that double bearing upon mechanical and\r\nchemical principles, which their name is intended to imply. Indeed,\r\nat first sight they appear to be purely Mechanical Sciences; the\r\nattractions and repulsions, the pressure and motion, which occur in\r\nthese cases, are referrible to mechanical conceptions and laws, as\r\ncompletely as the weight or fall of terrestrial bodies, or the\r\nmotion of the moon and planets. And if the phenomena of magnetism\r\nand electricity had directed us only to such laws, the corresponding\r\nsciences must have been arranged as branches of mechanics. But we\r\nfind that, on the other side, these phenomena have laws and bearings\r\nof a kind altogether different. Magnetism is associated with\r\nElectricity by its mechanical analogies; and, more recently, has\r\nbeen discovered to be still more closely connected with it by\r\nphysical influence; electric is identified with galvanic agency; but\r\nin galvanism, decomposition, or some action of that kind,\r\nuniversally appears; and these appearances lead to very general\r\nlaws. Now composition and decomposition are the subjects of\r\nChemistry; and thus we find that we are insensibly but irresistibly\r\nled into the domain of that science. The highest generalizations to\r\nwhich we can look, in advancing from the elementary facts of\r\nelectricity and galvanism, must involve chemical notions; we must\r\ntherefore, in laying out the platform of these sciences, make\r\nprovision for that convergence of mechanical and chemical theory,\r\nwhich they are to exhibit as we ascend.\r\n\r\nWe must begin, however, with stating the mechanical phenomena of\r\nthese sciences, and the reduction of such phenomena to laws. In this\r\npoint of view, the phenomena of which we have to speak are those in\r\nwhich bodies exhibit attractions and repulsions, peculiarly\r\ndetermined by their nature and circumstances; as the magnet, and a\r\n{192} piece of amber when rubbed. Such results are altogether\r\ndifferent from the universal attraction which, according to Newton's\r\ndiscovery, prevails among all particles of matter, and to which\r\ncosmical phenomena are owing. But yet the difference of these\r\nspecial attractions, and of cosmical attraction, was at first so far\r\nfrom being recognized, that the only way in which men could be led\r\nto conceive or assent to an action of one body upon another at a\r\ndistance, in cosmical cases, was by likening it to magnetic\r\nattraction, as we have seen in the history of Physical Astronomy.\r\nAnd we shall, in the first part of our account, not dwell much upon\r\nthe peculiar conditions under which bodies are magnetic or electric,\r\nsince these conditions are not readily reducible to mechanical laws;\r\nbut, taking the magnetic or electric character for granted, we shall\r\ntrace its effects.\r\n\r\nThe habit of considering magnetic action as the type or general case\r\nof attractive and repulsive agency, explains the early writers\r\nhaving spoken of Electricity as a kind of Magnetism. Thus Gilbert,\r\nin his book _De Magnete_ (1600), has a chapter,[1\\11] _De coitione\r\nMagniticâ, primumque de Succini attractione, sive verius corporum ad\r\nSuccinum applicatione_. The manner in which he speaks, shows us how\r\nmysterious the fact of attraction then appeared; so that, as he\r\nsays, \"the magnet and amber were called in aid by philosophers as\r\nillustrations, when our sense is in the dark in abstruse inquiries,\r\nand when our reason can go no further. Gilbert speaks of these\r\nphenomena like a genuine inductive philosopher, reproving[2\\11]\r\nthose who before him had \"stuffed the booksellers' shops by copying\r\nfrom one another extravagant stories concerning the attraction of\r\nmagnets and amber, without giving any reason from experiment.\" He\r\nhimself makes some important steps in the subject. He distinguishes\r\nmagnetic from _electric_ forces,[3\\11] and is the inventor of the\r\nlatter name, derived from ἤλεκτρον, _electron_, amber. He observes\r\nrightly, that the electric force attracts all light bodies, while\r\nthe magnetic force attracts iron only; and he devises a satisfactory\r\napparatus by which this is shown. He gives[4\\11] a considerable list\r\nof bodies which possess the electric property; \"Not only amber and\r\nagate attract small bodies, as some think, but diamond, sapphire,\r\ncarbuncle, opal, amethyst, Bristol gem, beryli, crystal, glass,\r\nglass of antimony, spar of various kinds, sulphur, mastic,\r\nsealing-wax,\" and other substances which he mentions. Even his\r\nspeculations on the general laws of these phenomena, though vague\r\nand erroneous, as {193} at that period was unavoidable, do him no\r\ndiscredit when compared with the doctrines of his successors a\r\ncentury and a half afterwards. But such speculations belong to a\r\nsucceeding part of this history.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\11: Lib. ii. cap. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\11: _De Magnete_, p. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\11: Ib. p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\11: Ib. p. 48.]\r\n\r\nIn treating of these Sciences, I will speak of Electricity in the\r\nfirst place; although it is thus separated by the interposition of\r\nMagnetism from the succeeding subjects (Galvanism, &c.) with which\r\nits alliance seems, at first sight, the closest, and although some\r\ngeneral notions of the laws of magnets were obtained at an earlier\r\nperiod than a knowledge of the corresponding relations of electric\r\nphenomena: for the theory of electric attraction and repulsion is\r\nsomewhat more simple than of magnetic; was, in fact, the first\r\nobtained; and was of use in suggesting and confirming the\r\ngeneralization of magnetic laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF LAWS OF ELECTRIC PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have already seen what was the state of this branch of knowledge\r\nat the beginning of the seventeenth century; and the advances made\r\nby Gilbert. We must now notice the additions which it subsequently\r\nreceived, and especially those which led to the discovery of general\r\nlaws, and the establishment of the theory; events of this kind being\r\nthose of which we have more peculiarly to trace the conditions and\r\ncauses. Among the facts which we have thus especially to attend to,\r\nare the electric attractions of small bodies by amber and other\r\nsubstances when rubbed. Boyle, who repeated and extended the\r\nexperiments of Gilbert, does not appear to have arrived at any new\r\ngeneral notions; but Otto Guericke of Magdeburg, about the same\r\ntime, made a very material step, by discovering that there was an\r\nelectric force of repulsion as well as of attraction. He found that\r\nwhen a globe of sulphur had attracted a feather, it afterwards\r\nrepelled it, till the feather had been in contact with some other\r\nbody. This, when verified under a due generality of circumstances,\r\nforms a capital fact in our present subject. Hawkesbee, who wrote in\r\n1709 (_Physico-Mechanical Experiments_) also observed various of the\r\neffects of attraction and repulsion upon threads hanging loosely.\r\nBut the person who appears to have first fully seized the general\r\nlaw of these facts, is {194} Dufay, whose experiments appear in the\r\nMemoirs of the French Academy, in 1733, 1734, and 1737.[5\\11] \"I\r\ndiscovered,\" he says, \"a very simple principle, which accounts for a\r\ngreat part of the irregularities, and, if I may use the term, the\r\ncaprices that seem to accompany most of the experiments in\r\nelectricity. This principle is, that electric bodies attract all\r\nthose that are not so, and repel them as soon as they are become\r\nelectric by the vicinity or contact of the electric body. . . . Upon\r\napplying this principle to various experiments of electricity, any\r\none will be surprised at the number of obscure and puzzling facts\r\nwhich it clears up.\" By the help of this principle, he endeavors to\r\nexplain several of Hawkesbee's experiments.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\11: Priestley's _History of Electricity_, p. 45, and the\r\nMemoirs quoted.]\r\n\r\nA little anterior to Dufay's experiments were those of Grey, who, in\r\n1729, discovered the properties of _conductors_. He found that the\r\nattraction and repulsion which appear in electric bodies are\r\nexhibited also by other bodies in contact with the electric. In this\r\nmanner he found that an ivory ball, connected with a glass tube by a\r\nstick, a wire, or a packthread, attracted and repelled a feather, as\r\nthe glass itself would have done. He was then led to try to extend\r\nthis communication to considerable distances, first by ascending to\r\nan upper window and hanging down his ball, and, afterwards, by\r\ncarrying the string horizontally supported on loops. As his success\r\nwas complete in the former case, he was perplexed by failure in the\r\nlatter; but when he supported the string by loops of silk instead of\r\nhempen cords, he found it again become a conductor of electricity.\r\nThis he ascribed at first to the smaller thickness of the silk,\r\nwhich did not carry off so much of the electric virtue; but from\r\nthis explanation he was again driven, by finding that wires of brass\r\nstill thinner than the silk destroyed the effect. Thus Grey\r\nperceived that the efficacy of the support depended on its being\r\nsilk, and he soon found other substances which answered the same\r\npurpose. The difference, in fact, depended on the supporting\r\nsubstance being electric, and therefore not itself a conductor; for\r\nit soon appeared from such experiments, and especially[6\\11] from\r\nthose made by Dufay, that substances might be divided into\r\n_electrics per se_, and _non-electrics_, or _conductors_. These\r\nterms were introduced by Desaguliers,[7\\11] and gave a permanent\r\ncurrency to the results of the labors of Grey and others.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\11: _Mém. Acad. Par._ 1734.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\11: Priestley, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nAnother very important discovery belonging to this period is, that\r\n{195} of the two kinds of electricity. This also was made by Dufay.\r\n\"Chance,\" says he, \"has thrown in my way another principle more\r\nuniversal and remarkable than the preceding one, and which casts a new\r\nlight upon the subject of electricity. The principle is, that there\r\nare two distinct kinds of electricity, very different from one\r\nanother; one of which I call _vitreous_, the other _resinous_,\r\nelectricity. The first is that of glass, gems, hair, wool, &c.; the\r\nsecond is that of amber, gum-lac, silk, &c. The characteristic of\r\nthese two electricities is, that they repel themselves and attract\r\neach other.\" This discovery does not, however, appear to have drawn so\r\nmuch attention as it deserved. It was published in 1735; (in the\r\nMemoirs of the Academy _for_ 1733;) and yet in 1747, Franklin and his\r\nfriends at Philadelphia, who had been supplied with electrical\r\napparatus and information by persons in England well acquainted with\r\nthe then present state of the subject, imagined that they were making\r\nobservations unknown to European science, when they were led to assert\r\ntwo conditions of bodies, which were in fact the opposite\r\nelectricities of Dufay, though the American experimenters referred\r\nthem to a single element, of which electrized bodies might have either\r\nexcess or defect. \"Hence,\" Franklin says, \"have arisen some new terms\r\namong us: we say B,\" who receives a spark from glass, \"and bodies in\r\nlike circumstances, is electrized _positively_; A,\" who communicates\r\nhis electricity to glass, \"_negatively_; or rather B is electrized\r\n_plus_, A _minus_.\" Dr. (afterwards Sir William) Watson had, about the\r\nsame time, arrived at the same conclusions, which he expresses by\r\nsaying that the electricity of A was _more rare_, and that of B _more\r\ndense_, than it naturally would have been.[8\\11] But that which gave\r\nthe main importance to this doctrine was its application to some\r\nremarkable experiments, of which we must now speak.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\11: Priestley, p. 115.]\r\n\r\nElectric action is accompanied, in many cases, by light and a\r\ncrackling sound. Otto Guericke[9\\11] observes that his\r\nsulphur-globe, when rubbed in a dark place, gave faint flashes, such\r\nas take place when sugar is crushed. And shortly after, a light was\r\nobserved at the surface of the mercury in the barometer, when\r\nshaken, which was explained at first by Bernoulli, on the then\r\nprevalent Cartesian principles; but, afterwards, more truly by\r\nHawkesbee, as an electrical phenomenon. Wall, in 1708, found sparks\r\nproduced by rubbing amber, and Hawkesbee observed the light and the\r\n_snapping_, as he calls it, under various modifications. But the\r\nelectric spark from a living body, which, as {196} Priestley\r\nsays,[10\\11] \"makes a principal part of the diversion of gentlemen\r\nand ladies who come to see experiments in electricity,\" was first\r\nobserved by Dufay and the Abbé Nollet. Nollet says[11\\11] he \"shall\r\nnever forget the surprise which the first electric spark ever drawn\r\nfrom the human body excited, both in M. Dufay and in himself.\" The\r\ndrawing of a spark from the human body was practised in various\r\nforms, one of which was familiarly known as the \"electrical kiss.\"\r\nOther exhibitions of electrical light were the electrical star,\r\nelectrical rain, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\11: _Experimenta Magdeburgica_, 1672, lib. iv. cap. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\11: P. p. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\11: Priestley, p. 47. Nollet, _Leçons de Physique_, vol.\r\nvi. p. 408.]\r\n\r\nAs electricians determined more exactly the conditions of electrical\r\naction, they succeeded in rendering more intense those sudden\r\nactions which the spark accompanies, and thus produced the electric\r\n_shock_. This was especially done in the _Leyden phial_. This\r\napparatus received its name, while the discovery of its property was\r\nattributed to Cunæus, a native of Leyden, who, in 1746, handling a\r\nvessel containing water in communication with the electrical\r\nmachine, and happening thus to bring the inside and the outside into\r\nconnexion, received a sudden shock in his arms and breast. It\r\nappears, however,[12\\11] that a shock had been received under nearly\r\nthe same circumstances in 1746, by Von Kleist, a German prelate, at\r\nCamin, in Pomerania. The strangeness of this occurrence, and the\r\nsuddenness of the blow, much exaggerated the estimate which men\r\nformed of its force. Muschenbroek, after taking one shock, declared\r\nhe would not take a second for the kingdom of France; though Boze,\r\nwith a more magnanimous spirit, wished[13\\11] that he might die by\r\nsuch a stroke, and have the circumstances of the experiment recorded\r\nin the Memoirs of the Academy. But we may easily imagine what a new\r\nfame and interest this discovery gave to the subject of electricity.\r\nIt was repeated in all parts of the world, with various\r\nmodifications: and the shock was passed through a line of several\r\npersons holding hands; Nollet, in the presence of the king of\r\nFrance, sent it through a circle of 180 men of the guards, and along\r\na line of men and wires of 900 toises;[14\\11] and experiments of the\r\nsame kind were made in England, principally under the direction of\r\nWatson, on a scale so large as to excite the admiration of\r\nMuschenbroek; who says, in a letter to Watson, \"Magnificentissimis\r\ntuis experimentis superasti conatus omnium.\" The result was, that\r\nthe transmission of electricity through a length of 12,000 feet was,\r\nto sense, instantaneous. {197}\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\11: Fischer, v. 490.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\11: Fischer, p. 84.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\11: Ibid. v. 512.]\r\n\r\nThe essential circumstances of the electric shock were gradually\r\nunravelled. Watson found that it did not increase in proportion\r\neither to the contents of the phial or the size of the globe by\r\nwhich the electricity was excited; that the outside coating of the\r\nglass (which, in the first form of the experiment, was only a film\r\nof water), and its contents, might be varied in different ways. To\r\nFranklin is due the merit of clearly pointing out most of the\r\ncircumstances on which the efficacy of the Leyden phial depends. He\r\nshowed, in 1747,[15\\11] that the inside of the bottle is electrized\r\npositively, the outside negatively; and that the shock is produced\r\nby the restoration of the equilibrium, when the outside and inside\r\nare brought into communication suddenly. But in order to complete\r\nthis discovery, it remained to be shown that the electric matter was\r\ncollected entirely at the surface of the glass, and that the\r\nopposite electricities on the two opposite sides of the glass were\r\naccumulated by their mutual attraction. Monnier the younger\r\ndiscovered that the electricity which bodies can receive, depends\r\nupon their surface rather than their mass, and Franklin[16\\11] soon\r\nfound that \"the whole force of the bottle, and power of giving a\r\nshock, is in the glass itself.\" This they proved by decanting the\r\nwater out of an electrized into another bottle, when it appeared\r\nthat the second bottle did not become electric, but the first\r\nremained so. Thus it was found \"that the non-electrics, in contact\r\nwith the glass, served only to unite the force of the several parts.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\11: _Letters_, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\11: _Letters_, iv. Sect. 16.]\r\n\r\nSo far as the effect of the coating of the Leyden phial is\r\nconcerned, this was satisfactory and complete: but Franklin was not\r\nequally successful in tracing the action of the electric matter upon\r\nitself, in virtue of which it is accumulated in the phial; indeed,\r\nhe appears to have ascribed the effect to some property of the\r\nglass. The mode of describing this action varied, accordingly as two\r\nelectric _fluids_ were supposed (with Dufay,) or one, which was the\r\nview taken by Franklin. On this latter supposition the parts of the\r\nelectric fluid repel each other, and the excess in one surface of\r\nthe glass expels the fluid from the other surface. This kind of\r\naction, however, came into much clearer view in the experiments of\r\nCanton, Wilcke, and Æpinus. It was principally manifested in the\r\nattractions and repulsions which objects exert when they are in the\r\nneighborhood of electrized bodies; or in the _electrical\r\natmosphere_, using the phraseology of the time. At present we say\r\nthat bodies are electrized _by induction_, when they are {198} thus\r\nmade electric by the electric attraction and repulsion of other\r\nbodies. Canton's experiments were communicated to the Royal Society\r\nin 1753, and show that the electricity on each body acts upon the\r\nelectricity of another body, at a distance, with a repulsive energy.\r\nWilcke, in like manner, showed that parts of non-electrics, plunged\r\nin electric atmospheres, acquire an electricity opposite to that of\r\nsuch atmospheres. And Æpinus devised a method of examining the\r\nnature of the electricity at any part of the surface of a body, by\r\nmeans of which he ascertained its distribution, and found that it\r\nagreed with such a law of self-repulsion. His attempt to give\r\nmathematical precision to this induction was one of the most\r\nimportant steps towards electrical theory, and must be spoken of\r\nshortly, in that point of view. But in the mean time we may observe,\r\nthat this doctrine was applied to the explanation of the Leyden jar;\r\nand the explanation was confirmed by charging a plate of air, and\r\nobtaining a shock from it, in a manner which the theory pointed out.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to the history of the theory, we must mention some\r\nother of the laws of phenomena which were noticed, and which theory\r\nwas expected to explain. Among the most celebrated of these, were\r\nthe effect of sharp points in conductors, and the phenomena of\r\nelectricity in the atmosphere. The former of these circumstances was\r\none of the first which Franklin observed as remarkable. It was found\r\nthat the points of needles and the like throw off and draw off the\r\nelectric virtue; thus a bodkin, directed towards an electrized ball,\r\nat six or eight inches' distance, destroyed its electric action. The\r\nlatter subject, involving the consideration of thunder and\r\nlightning, and of many other meteorological phenomena, excited great\r\ninterest. The comparison of the electric spark to lightning had very\r\nearly been made; but it was only when the discharge had been\r\nrendered more powerful in the Leyden jar, that the comparison of the\r\neffects became very plausible. Franklin, about 1750, had offered a\r\nfew somewhat vague conjectures[17\\11] respecting the existence of\r\nelectricity in the clouds; but it was not till Wilcke and Æpinus had\r\nobtained clear notions of the effect of electric matter at a\r\ndistance, that the real condition of the clouds could be well\r\nunderstood. In 1752, however,[18\\11] D'Alibard, and other French\r\nphilosophers, were desirous of verifying Franklin's conjecture of\r\nthe analogy of thunder and electricity. This they did by erecting a\r\npointed iron rod, forty feet high, {199} at Marli: the rod was found\r\ncapable of giving out electrical sparks when a thunder-cloud passed\r\nover the place. This was repeated in various parts of Europe, and\r\nFranklin suggested that a communication with the clouds might be\r\nformed by means of a kite. By these, and similar means, the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere was studied by Canton in England,\r\nMazeas in France, Beccaria in Italy, and others elsewhere. These\r\nessays soon led to a fatal accident, the death of Richman at\r\nPetersburg, while he was, on Aug. 6th, 1753, observing the\r\nelectricity collected from an approaching thunder-cloud, by means of\r\na rod which he called an electrical gnomon: a globe of blue fire was\r\nseen to leap from the rod to the head of the unfortunate professor,\r\nwho was thus struck dead.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\11: Letter v.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\11: Franklin, p. 107.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [As an important application of the doctrines of\r\nelectricity, I may mention the contrivances employed to protect\r\nships from the effects of lightning. The use of conductors in such\r\ncases is attended with peculiar difficulties. In 1780 the French\r\nbegan to turn their attention to this subject, and Le Roi was sent\r\nto Brest and the various sea-ports of France for that purpose.\r\nChains temporarily applied in the rigging had been previously\r\nsuggested, but he endeavored to place, he says, such conductors in\r\nships as might be fixed and durable. He devised certain long linked\r\nrods, which led from a point in the mast-head along a part of the\r\nrigging, or in divided stages along the masts, and were fixed to\r\nplates of metal in the ship's sides communicating with the sea. But\r\nthese were either unable to stand the working of the rigging, or\r\notherwise inconvenient, and were finally abandoned.[19\\11]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\11: See Le Roi's Memoir in the _Hist. Acad. Sc._ for 1790.]\r\n\r\nThe conductor commonly used in the English Navy, till recently,\r\nconsisted of a flexible copper chain, tied, when occasion required,\r\nto the mast-head, and reaching down into the sea; a contrivance\r\nrecommended by Dr. Watson in 1762. But notwithstanding this\r\nprecaution, the shipping suffered greatly from the effects of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nMr. Snow Harris (now Sir William Snow Harris), whose electrical\r\nlabors are noticed above, proposed to the Admiralty, in 1820, a plan\r\nwhich combined the conditions of ship-conductors, so desirable, yet\r\nso difficult to secure:--namely, that they should be permanently\r\nfixed, and sufficiently large, and yet should in no way interfere\r\nwith the motion of the rigging, or with the sliding masts. The\r\nmethod which he proposed was to make the masts themselves conductors\r\nof electricity, {200} by incorporating with them, in a peculiar way,\r\ntwo laminæ of sheet-copper, uniting these with the metallic masses\r\nin the hull by other laminæ, and giving the whole a free\r\ncommunication with the sea. This method was tried experimentally,\r\nboth on models and to a large extent in the navy itself; and a\r\nCommission appointed to examine the result reported themselves\r\nhighly satisfied with Mr. Harris's plan, and strongly recommended\r\nthat it should be fully carried out in the Navy.[20\\11]]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\11: See Mr. Snow Harris's paper in _Phil. Mag._ March, 1841.]\r\n\r\nIt is not here necessary to trace the study of atmospheric\r\nelectricity any further: and we must now endeavor to see how these\r\nphenomena and laws of phenomena which we have related, were worked\r\nup into consistent theories; for though many experimental\r\nobservations and measures were made after this time, they were\r\nguided by the theory, and may be considered as having rather\r\ndischarged the office of confirming than of suggesting it.\r\n\r\nWe may observe also that we have now described the period of most\r\nextensive activity and interest in electrical researches. These\r\nnaturally occurred while the general notions and laws of the\r\nphenomena were becoming, and were not yet become, fixed and clear.\r\nAt such a period, a large and popular circle of spectators and\r\namateurs feel themselves nearly upon a level, in the value of their\r\ntrials and speculations, with more profound thinkers: at a later\r\nperiod, when the subject is become a science, that is, a study in\r\nwhich all must be left far behind who do not come to it with\r\ndisciplined, informed, and logical minds, the cultivators are far\r\nmore few, and the shout of applause less tumultuous and less loud.\r\nWe may add, too, that the experiments, which are the most striking\r\nto the senses, lose much of their impressiveness with their novelty.\r\nElectricity, to be now studied rightly, must be reasoned upon\r\nmathematically; how slowly such a mode of study makes its way, we\r\nshall see in the progress of the theory, which we must now proceed\r\nto narrate.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [A new mode of producing electricity has excited much\r\nnotice lately. In October, 1840, one of the workmen in attendance\r\nupon a boiler belonging to the Newcastle and Durham Railway,\r\nreported that the boiler was full of fire; the fact  being, that\r\nwhen he placed his hand near it an electrical spark was given out.\r\nThis drew the attention of Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Pattinson, who made\r\nthe circumstance publicly known.[21\\11] Mr. Armstrong pursued the\r\ninvestigation {201} with great zeal, and after various conjectures\r\nwas able to announce[22\\11] that the electricity was excited at the\r\npoint where the steam is subject to friction in its emission. He\r\nfound too that he could produce a like effect by the emission of\r\ncondensed air. Following out his views, he was able to construct,\r\nfor the Polytechnic Institution in London, a \"Hydro-electric\r\nMachine,\" of greater power than any electrical machine previously\r\nmade. Dr. Faraday took up the investigation as the subject of the\r\nEighteenth Series of his _Researches_, sent to the Royal Society,\r\nJan. 26, 1842; and in this he illustrated, with his usual command of\r\ncopious and luminous experiments, a like view;--that the electricity\r\nis produced by the friction of the particles of the water carried\r\nalong by the **steam. And thus this is a new manifestation of that\r\nelectricity, which, to distinguish it from voltaic electricity, is\r\nsometimes called _Friction Electricity_ or _Machine Electricity_.\r\nDr. Faraday has, however, in the course of this investigation,\r\nbrought to light several new electrical relations of bodies.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\11: _Phil. Mag._ Oct 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\11: _Phil. Mag._ Jan. 1848, dated Dec. 9, 1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF ELECTRICAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE cause of electrical phenomena, and the mode of its operation,\r\nwere naturally at first spoken of in an indistinct and wavering\r\nmanner. It was called the electric _fire_, the electric _fluid_; its\r\neffects were attributed to _virtues_, _effluvia_, _atmospheres_.\r\nWhen men's mechanical ideas became somewhat more distinct, the\r\nmotions and tendencies to motion were ascribed to _currents_, in the\r\nsame manner as the cosmical motions had been in the Cartesian\r\nsystem. This doctrine of currents was maintained by Nollet, who\r\nascribed all the phenomena of electrized bodies to the\r\ncontemporaneous afflux and efflux of electrical matter. It was an\r\nimportant step towards sound theory, to get rid of this notion of\r\nmoving fluids, and to consider attraction and repulsion as statical\r\nforces; and this appears to have been done by others about the same\r\ntime. Dufay[23\\11] considered that he had proved the existence of\r\ntwo electricities, the vitreous and the resinous, and conceived each\r\n{202} of these to be a fluid which repelled its own parts and\r\nattracted those of the other: this is, in fact, the outline of the\r\ntheory which recently has been considered as the best established;\r\nbut from various causes it was not at once, or at least not\r\ngenerally adopted. The hypothesis of the excess and defect of a\r\nsingle fluid is capable of being so treated as to give the same\r\nresults with the hypothesis of two opposite fluids and happened to\r\nobtain the preference for some time. We have already seen that this\r\nhypothesis, according to which electric phenomena arose from the\r\nexcess and defect of a generally diffused fluid, suggested itself to\r\nWatson and Franklin about 1747. Watson found that when an electric\r\nbody was excited, the electricity was not created, but collected;\r\nand Franklin held, that when the Leyden jar was charged, the\r\nquantity of electricity was unaltered, though its distribution was\r\nchanged. Symmer[24\\11] maintained the existence of two fluids; and\r\nCigna supplied the main defect which belonged to this tenet in the\r\nway in which Dufay held it, by showing that the two opposite\r\nelectricities were usually produced at the same time. Still the\r\napparent simplicity of the hypothesis of one fluid procured it many\r\nsupporters. It was that which Franklin adopted, in his explanation\r\nof the Leyden experiment; and though after the first conception of\r\nan electrical charge as a disturbance of equilibrium, there was\r\nnothing in the development or details of Franklin's views which\r\ndeserved to win for them any peculiar authority, his reputation, and\r\nhis skill as a writer, gave a considerable influence to his\r\nopinions. Indeed, for a time he was considered, over a large part of\r\nEurope, as the creator of the science, and the terms[25\\11]\r\n_Franklinism_, _Franklinist_, _Franklinian system_, occur in almost\r\nevery page of continental publications on the subject. Yet the\r\nelectrical phenomena to the knowledge of which Franklin added least,\r\nthose of induction, were those by which the progress of the theory\r\nwas most promoted. These, as we have already said, were at first\r\nexplained by the hypothesis of electrical atmospheres. Lord Mahon\r\nwrote a treatise, in which this hypothesis was mathematically\r\ntreated; yet the hypothesis was very untenable, for it would not\r\naccount for the most obvious cases of induction, such as the Leyden\r\njar, except the atmosphere was supposed to penetrate glass.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\11: _Ac. Par._ 1733, p. 467]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\11: _Phil. Trans._ 1759.]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\11: Priestley, p. 160.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of electricity by induction, when fairly considered by\r\na person of clear notions of the relations of space and force, were\r\nseen to accommodate themselves very generally to the conception\r\n{203} introduced by Dufay;[26\\11] of two electricities each\r\nrepelling itself and attracting the other. If we suppose that there\r\nis only one fluid, which repels itself and attracts all other\r\nmatter, we obtain, in many cases, the same general results as if we\r\nsuppose two fluids; thus, if an electrized body, overcharged with\r\nthe single fluid, act upon a ball, it drives the electric fluid in\r\nthe ball to the further side by its repulsion, and then attracts the\r\nball by attracting the matter of the ball more than it repels the\r\nfluid which is upon the ball. If we suppose two fluids, the\r\npositively electrized body draws the negative fluid to the nearer\r\nside of the ball, repels the positive fluid to the opposite side,\r\nand attracts the ball on the whole, because the attracted fluid is\r\nnearer than that which is repelled. The verification of either of\r\nthese hypotheses, and the determination of their details, depended\r\nnecessarily upon experiment and calculation. It was under the\r\nhypothesis of a single fluid that this trial was first properly\r\nmade. Æpinus of Petersburg published, in 1759, his _Tentamen Theoriæ\r\nElectricitatis et Magnetismi_; in which he traces mathematically the\r\nconsequences of the hypothesis of an electric fluid, attracting all\r\nother matter, but repelling itself; the law of force of this\r\nrepulsion and attraction he did not pretend to assign precisely,\r\nconfining himself to the supposition that the mutual force of the\r\nparticles increases as the distance decreases. But it was found,\r\nthat in order to make this theory tenable, an additional supposition\r\nwas required, namely, that the particles of bodies repel each other\r\nas much as they attract the electric fluid.[27\\11] For if two\r\nbodies, A and B, be in their natural electrical condition, they\r\nneither attract nor repel each other. Now, in this case, the fluid\r\nin A attracts the matter in B and repels the fluid in B with equal\r\nenergy, and thus no tendency to motion results from the fluid in A;\r\nand if we further suppose that the _matter_ in A attracts the fluid\r\nin B and _repels the matter_ in B with equal energy, we have the\r\nresulting mutual inactivity of the two bodies explained; but without\r\nthe latter supposition, there would be a mutual attraction: or we\r\nmay put the truth more simply thus; two negatively electrized bodies\r\nrepel each other; if negative electrization were merely the\r\nabstraction of the fluid which is the repulsive element, this result\r\ncould not follow except there were a repulsion in the bodies\r\nthemselves, independent of the fluid. And thus Æpinus found himself\r\ncompelled to assume this mutual repulsion of material particles; he\r\nhad, in fact, the {204} alternative of this supposition, or that of\r\ntwo fluids, to choose between, for the mathematical results of both\r\nhypotheses are the same. Wilcke, a Swede, who had at first asserted\r\nand worked out the Æpinian theory in its original form, afterwards\r\ninclined to the opinion of Symmer; and Coulomb, when, at a later\r\nperiod, he confirmed the theory by his experiments and determined\r\nthe law of force, did not hesitate to prefer[28\\11] the theory of\r\ntwo fluids, \"because,\" he says, \"it appears to me contradictory to\r\nadmit at the same time, in the particles of bodies, an attractive\r\nforce in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances, which is\r\ndemonstrated by universal gravitation, and a repulsive force in the\r\nsame inverse ratio of the squares of the distances; a force which\r\nwould necessarily be infinitely great relatively to the action of\r\ngravitation.\" We may add, that by forcing us upon this doctrine of\r\nthe universal repulsion of matter, the theory of a single fluid\r\nseems quite to lose that superiority in the way of simplicity which\r\nhad originally been its principal recommendation.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\11: _Mém. A. P._ 1733, p. 467.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\11: Robison, vol. iv. p. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\11: _Mém. Ac. P._ 1788, p. 671.]\r\n\r\nThe mathematical results of the supposition of Æpinus, which are, as\r\nCoulomb observes,[29\\11] the same as of that of the two fluids, were\r\ntraced by the author himself in the work referred to, and shown to\r\nagree, in a great number of cases, with the observed facts of\r\nelectrical induction, attraction, and repulsion. Apparently this\r\nwork did not make its way very rapidly through Europe; for in 1771,\r\nHenry Cavendish stated[30\\11] the same hypothesis in a paper read\r\nbefore the Royal Society; which he prefaces by saying, \"Since I\r\nfirst wrote the following paper, I find that this way of accounting\r\nfor the phenomena of electricity is not new. Æpinus, in his\r\n_Tentamen Theoriæ Electricitatis et Magnetismi_, has made use of the\r\nsame, or nearly the same hypothesis that I have; and the conclusions\r\nhe draws from it agree nearly with mine as far as he goes.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\11: _Ac. P._ 1788, p. 672.]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\11: _Phil. Trans._ 1771, vol. lxi.]\r\n\r\nThe confirmation of the theory was, of course, to be found in the\r\nagreement of its results with experiment; and in particular, in the\r\nfacts of electrical induction, attraction, and repulsion, which\r\nsuggested the theory. Æpinus showed that such a confirmation\r\nappeared in a number of the most obvious cases; and to these,\r\nCavendish added others, which, though not obvious, were of such a\r\nnature that the calculations, in general difficult or impossible,\r\ncould in these instances be easily performed; as, for example, cases\r\nin which there are plates or globes at the two extremities of a long\r\nwire. In all these cases of {205} electrical action the theory was\r\njustified. But in order to give it full confirmation, it was to be\r\nconsidered whether any other facts, not immediately assumed in the\r\nfoundation of the theory, were explained by it; a circumstance\r\nwhich, as we have seen, gave the final stamp of truth to the\r\ntheories of astronomy and optics. Now we appear to have such\r\nconfirmation, in the effect of points, and in the phenomena of the\r\nelectrical discharge. The theory of neither of these was fully\r\nunderstood by Cavendish, but he made an approach to the true view of\r\nthem. If one part of a conducting body be a sphere of small radius,\r\nthe electric fluid upon the surface of this sphere will, it appears\r\nby calculation, be more dense, and tend to escape more\r\nenergetically, in proportion as the radius of the sphere is smaller;\r\nand, therefore, if we consider a point as part of the surface of a\r\nsphere of imperceptible radius, it follows from the theory that the\r\neffort of the fluid to escape at that place will be enormous; so\r\nthat it may easily be supposed to overcome the resisting causes. And\r\nthe discharge may be explained in nearly the same manner; for when a\r\nconductor is brought nearer and nearer to an electrized body, the\r\nopposite electricity is more and more accumulated by attraction on\r\nthe side next to the electrized body; its tension becomes greater by\r\nthe increase of its quantity and the diminution of the distance, and\r\nat last it is too strong to be contained, and leaps out in the form\r\nof a spark.\r\n\r\nThe light, sound, and mechanical effects produced by the electric\r\ndischarge, made the electric _fluid_ to be not merely considered as\r\na mathematical hypothesis, useful for reducing phenomena to formulæ\r\n(as for a long time the magnetic fluid was), but caused it to be at\r\nonce and universally accepted as a physical reality, of which we\r\nlearn the existence by the common use of the senses, and of which\r\nmeasures and calculations are only wanted to teach us the laws.\r\n\r\nThe applications of the theory of electricity which I have\r\nprincipally considered above, are those which belong to conductors,\r\nin which the electric fluid is perfectly moveable, and can take that\r\ndistribution which the forces require. In non-conducting or electric\r\nbodies, the conditions to which the fluid is subject are less easy\r\nto determine; but by supposing that the fluid moves with great\r\ndifficulty among the particles of such bodies,--that nevertheless it\r\nmay be dislodged and accumulated in parts of the surface of such\r\nbodies, by friction and other modes of excitement; and that the\r\nearth is an inexhaustible reservoir of electric matter,--the\r\nprincipal facts of excitation and the like receive a tolerably\r\nsatisfactory explanation. {206}\r\n\r\nThe theory of Æpinus, however, still required to have the law of\r\naction of the particles of the fluid determined. If we were to call\r\nto mind how momentous an event in physical astronomy was the\r\ndetermination of the law of the cosmical forces, the inverse square\r\nof the distance, and were to suppose the importance and difficulty\r\nof the analogous step in this case to be of the same kind, this\r\nwould be to mistake the condition of science at that time. The\r\nleading idea, the conception of the possibility of explaining\r\nnatural phenomena by means of the action of forces, on rigorously\r\nmechanical principles, had already been promulgated by Newton, and\r\nwas, from the first, seen to be peculiarly applicable to electrical\r\nphenomena; so that the very material step of clearly proposing the\r\nproblem, often more important than the solution of it, had already\r\nbeen made. Moreover the confirmation of the truth of the assumed\r\ncause in the astronomical case depended on taking the right law; but\r\nthe electrical theory could be confirmed, in a general manner at\r\nleast, without this restriction. Still it was an important discovery\r\nthat the law of the inverse square prevailed in these as well as in\r\ncosmical attractions.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to conjecture beforehand that it would be so.\r\nCavendish had professed in his calculations not to take the exponent\r\nof the inverse power, on which the force depended, to be strictly 2,\r\nbut to leave it indeterminate between 1 and 3; but in his\r\napplications of his results, he obviously inclines to the assumption\r\nthat it is 2. Experimenters tried to establish this in various ways.\r\nRobison,[31\\11] in 1769, had already proved that the law of force is\r\nvery nearly or exactly the inverse square; and Meyer[32\\11] had\r\ndiscovered, but not published, the same result. The clear and\r\nsatisfactory establishment of this truth is due to Coulomb, and was\r\none of the first steps in his important series of researches on this\r\nsubject. In his first paper[33\\11] in the _Memoirs_ of the Academy\r\nfor 1785, he proves this law for small globes; in his second Memoir\r\nhe shows it to be true for globes one and two feet in diameter. His\r\ninvention of the _torsion-balance_, which measures very small forces\r\nwith great certainty and exactness, enabled him to set this question\r\nat rest for ever.\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\11: _Works_, iv. p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\11: _Biog. Univ._ art. _Coulumb_, by Biot.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\11: _Mém. A. P._ 1785, pp. 569, 578.]\r\n\r\nThe law of force being determined for the particles of the electric\r\nfluid, it now came to be the business of the experimenter and the\r\n{207} mathematician to compare the results of the theory in detail\r\nwith those of experimental measures. Coulomb undertook both portions\r\nof the task. He examined the electricity of portions of bodies by\r\nmeans of a little disk (his _tangent plane_) which he applied to\r\nthem and then removed, and which thus acted as a sort of electric\r\n_taster_. His numerical results (the intensity being still measured\r\nby the torsion-balance) are the fundamental facts of the theory of\r\nthe electrical fluid. Without entering into detail, we may observe\r\nthat he found the electricity to be entirely collected at the\r\nsurface of conductors (which Beccaria had before shown to be the\r\ncase), and that he examined and recorded the electric intensity at\r\nthe surface of globes, cylinders, and other conducting bodies,\r\nplaced within each other's influence in various ways.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical calculation of the distribution of two fluids, all\r\nthe particles of which attract and repel each other according to the\r\nabove law, was a problem of no ordinary difficulty; as may easily be\r\nimagined, when it is recollected that the attraction and repulsion\r\ndetermine the distribution, and the distribution reciprocally\r\ndetermines the attraction and repulsion. The problem was of the same\r\nnature as that of the figure of the earth; and its rigorous solution\r\nwas beyond the powers of the analysis of Coulomb's time. He obtained,\r\nhowever, approximate solutions with much ingenuity; for instance, in a\r\ncase in which it was obvious that the electric fluid would be most\r\naccumulated at and near the equator of a certain sphere, he calculated\r\nthe action of the sphere on two suppositions: first, that the fluid\r\nwas all collected precisely at the equator; and next, that it was\r\nuniformly diffused over the surface; and he then assumed the actual\r\ncase to be intermediate between these two. By such artifices he was\r\nable to show that the results of his experiments and of his\r\ncalculations gave an agreement sufficiently near to entitle him to\r\nconsider the theory as established on a solid basis.\r\n\r\nThus, at this period, mathematics was behind experiment; and a problem\r\nwas proposed, in which theoretical numerical results were wanted for\r\ncomparison with observation, but could not be accurately obtained; as\r\nwas the case in astronomy also, till the time of the approximate\r\nsolution of the Problem of Three Bodies, and the consequent formation\r\nof the Tables of the Moon and Planets on the theory of universal\r\ngravitation. After some time, electrical theory was relieved from this\r\nreproach, mainly in consequence of the progress which astronomy had\r\noccasioned in pure mathematics. About 1801, {208} there appeared in\r\nthe _Bulletin des Sciences_,[34\\11] an exact solution of the problem\r\nof the distribution of electric fluid on a spheroid, obtained by M.\r\nBiot, by the application of the peculiar methods which Laplace had\r\ninvented for the problem of the figure of the planets. And in 1811, M.\r\nPoisson applied Laplace's artifices to the case of two spheres acting\r\nupon one another in contact, a case to which many of Coulomb's\r\nexperiments were referrible; and the agreement of the results of\r\ntheory and observation, thus extricated from Coulomb's numbers,\r\nobtained above forty years previously, was very striking and\r\nconvincing.[35\\11] It followed also from Poisson's calculations, that\r\nwhen two electrized spheres are brought near each other, the\r\naccumulation of the opposite electricities on their nearest points\r\nincreases without limit as the spheres approach to contact; so that\r\nbefore the contact takes place, the external resistance will be\r\novercome, and a _spark_ will pass.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\11: No. li.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\11: _Mém. A. P._ 1811.]\r\n\r\nThough the relations of non-conductors to electricity, and various\r\nother circumstances, leave many facts imperfectly explained by the\r\ntheory, yet we may venture to say that, as a theory which gives the\r\nlaws of the phenomena, and which determines the distribution of\r\nthose elementary forces, on the surface of electrized bodies, from\r\nwhich elementary forces (whether arising from the presence of a\r\nfluid or not,) the total effects result, the doctrine of Dufay and\r\nCoulomb, as developed in the analysis of Poisson, is securely and\r\npermanently established. This part of the subject has been called\r\n_statical electricity_. In the establishment of the theory of this\r\nbranch of science, we must, I conceive, allow to Dufay more merit\r\nthan is generally ascribed to him; since he saw clearly, and\r\nenunciated in a manner which showed that he duly appreciated their\r\ncapital character, the two chief principles,--the conditions of\r\nelectrical attraction and repulsion, and the apparent existence of\r\ntwo kinds of electricity. His views of attraction are, indeed,\r\npartly expressed in terms of the Cartesian hypothesis of vortices,\r\nthen prevalent in France; but, at the time when he wrote, these\r\nforms of speech indicated scarcely anything besides the power of\r\nattraction. Franklin's real merit as a discoverer was, that he was\r\none of the first who distinctly conceived the electrical _charge_ as\r\na derangement of equilibrium. The great fame which, in his day, he\r\nenjoyed, arose from the clearness and spirit with which he narrated\r\nhis discoveries; from his dealing with electricity in the imposing\r\nform of thunder and lightning; and partly, perhaps, from his\r\ncharacter as an {209} American and a politician; for he was already,\r\nin 1736, engaged in public affairs as clerk to the General Assembly\r\nof Pennsylvania, though it was not till a later period of his life\r\nthat his admirers had the occasion of saying of him\r\n  Eripuit cœlis fulmen sceptrumque tyrannis;\r\n  Born to control all lawless force, all fierce and baleful sway,\r\n  The thunder's bolt, the tyrant's rod, alike he wrenched away.\r\n\r\nÆpinus and Coulomb were two of the most eminent physical\r\nphilosophers of the last century, and labored in the way peculiarly\r\nrequired by that generation; whose office it was to examine the\r\nresults, in particular subjects, of the general conception of\r\nattraction and repulsion, as introduced by Newton. The reasonings of\r\nthe Newtonian period had, in some measure, anticipated all possible\r\ntheories resembling the electrical doctrine of Æpinus and Coulomb;\r\nand, on that account, this doctrine could not be introduced and\r\nconfirmed in a sudden and striking manner, so as to make a great\r\nepoch. Accordingly, Dufay, Symmer, Watson, Franklin, Æpinus and\r\nCoulomb, have all a share in the process of induction. With\r\nreference to these founders of the theory of electricity, Poisson\r\nholds the same place which Laplace holds with reference to Newton.\r\n\r\nThe reception of the Coulombian theory (so we most call it, for the\r\nÆpinian theory implies one fluid only,) has hitherto not been so\r\ngeneral as might have been reasonably expected from its very\r\nbeautiful accordance with the facts which it contemplates. This has\r\npartly been owing to the extreme abstruseness of the mathematical\r\nreasoning which it employs, and which put it out of the reach of\r\nmost experimenters and writers of works of general circulation. The\r\ntheory of Æpinus was explained by Robison in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_; the analysis of Poisson has recently been presented to\r\nthe public in the _Encyclopædia Metropolitana_, but is of a kind not\r\neasily mastered even by most mathematicians. On these accounts\r\nprobably it is, that in English compilations of science, we find,\r\neven to this day, the two theories of one and of two fluids stated\r\nas if they were nearly on a par in respect of their experimental\r\nevidence. Still we may say that the Coulombian theory is probably\r\nassented to by all who have examined it, at least as giving the laws\r\nof phenomena; and I have not heard of any denial of it from such a\r\nquarter, or of any attempt to show it to be erroneous by detailed\r\nand measured experiments. Mr. Snow Harris {210} has recently[36\\11]\r\ndescribed some important experiments and measures; but his apparatus\r\nwas of such a kind that the comparison of the results with the\r\nCoulombian theory was not easy; and indeed the mathematical problems\r\nwhich Mr. Harris's combinations offered, require another Poisson for\r\ntheir solution. Still the more obvious results are such as agree\r\nwith the theory, even in the cases in which their author considered\r\nthem to be inexplicable. For example, he found that by doubling the\r\nquantity of electricity of a conductor, it attracted a body with\r\nfour times the force; but the body not being insulated, would have\r\nits electricity also doubled by induction, and thus the fact was\r\nwhat the theory required.\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\11: _Phil. Trans._ 1834, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nThough it is thus highly probable that the Coulombian theory of\r\nelectricity (or the Æpinian, which is mathematically equivalent)\r\nwill stand as a true representation of the law of the elementary\r\nactions, we must yet allow that it has not received that complete\r\nevidence, by means of experiments and calculations added to those of\r\nits founders, which the precedents of other permanent sciences have\r\nled us to look for. The experiments of Coulomb, which he used in the\r\nestablishment of the theory, were not very numerous, and they were\r\nlimited to a peculiar form of bodies, namely spheres. In order to\r\nform the proper _sequel_ to the promulgation of this theory, to give\r\na full _confirmation_, and to ensure its general _reception_, we\r\nought to have experiments more numerous and more varied (such as\r\nthose of Mr. Harris are) shown to agree in all respects with results\r\ncalculated from the theory. This would, as we have said, be a task\r\nof labor and difficulty; but the person who shall execute it will\r\ndeserve to be considered as one of the real founders of the true\r\ndoctrine of electricity. To show that the coincidence between theory\r\nand observation, which has already been proved for spherical\r\nconductors, obtains also for bodies of other forms, will be a step\r\nin electricity analogous to what was done in astronomy, when it was\r\nshown that the law of gravitation applied to comets as well as to\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\nBut although we consider the views of Æpinus or Coulomb in a very\r\nhigh degree probable as a _formal theory_, the question is very\r\ndifferent when we come to examine them as a _physical theory_;--that\r\nis, when we inquire whether there really is a material electric\r\nfluid or fluids.\r\n\r\n_Question of One or Two Fluids._--In the first place as to the\r\nquestion whether the fluids are one or two;--Coulomb's introduction\r\nof {211} the hypothesis of two fluids has been spoken of as a reform\r\nof the theory of Æpinus; it would probably have been more safe to\r\nhave called his labors an advance in the calculation, and in the\r\ncomparison of hypothesis with experiment, than to have used language\r\nwhich implied that the question, between the rival hypotheses of one\r\nor two fluids, could be treated as settled. For, in reality, if we\r\nassume, as Æpinus does, the mutual repulsion of all the particles of\r\nmatter, in addition to the repulsion of the particles of the\r\nelectric fluid for one another and their attraction for the\r\nparticles of matter, the one fluid of Æpinus will give exactly the\r\nsame results as the two fluids of Coulomb. The mathematical formulæ\r\nof Coulomb and of Poisson express the conditions of the one case as\r\nwell as of the other; the interpretation only being somewhat\r\ndifferent. The place of the forces of the resinous fluid is supplied\r\nby the excess of the forces ascribed to the matter above the forces\r\nof the fluid, in the parts where the electric fluid is deficient.\r\n\r\nThe obvious argument against this hypothesis is, that we ascribe to\r\nthe particles of matter a mutual repulsion, in addition to the\r\nmutual attraction of universal gravitation, and that this appears\r\nincongruous. Accordingly, Æpinus says, that when he was first driven\r\nto this proposition it horrified him.[37\\11] But we may answer it in\r\nthis way very satisfactorily:--If we suppose the mutual repulsion of\r\nmatter to be somewhat less than the mutual attraction of matter and\r\nelectric fluid, it will follow, as a consequence of the hypothesis,\r\nthat besides all obvious electrical action, the particles of matter\r\nwould attract each other with forces varying inversely as the square\r\nof the distance. Thus gravitation itself becomes an electrical\r\nphenomenon, arising from the residual excess of attraction over\r\nrepulsion; and the fact which is urged against the hypothesis\r\nbecomes a confirmation of it. By this consideration the prerogative\r\nof simplicity passes over to the side of the hypothesis of one\r\nfluid; and the rival view appears to lose at least all its\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\11: Neque diffiteor cum ipsa se mihi offerret . . . . me ad\r\nipsam quodammodo  exhorruisse. _Tentamen Theor. Elect._ p. 39.]\r\n\r\nVery recently, M. Mosotti[38\\11] has calculated the results of the\r\nÆpinian theory in a far more complete manner than had previously\r\nbeen performed; using Laplace's coefficients, as Poisson had done\r\nfor the {212} Coulombian theory. He finds that, from the supposition\r\nof a fluid and of particles of matter exercising such forces as that\r\ntheory assumes (with the very allowable additional supposition that\r\nthe particles are small compared with their distances), it follows\r\nthat the particles would exert a force, repulsive at the smallest\r\ndistances, a little further on vanishing, afterwards attractive, and\r\nat all sensible distances attracting in proportion to the inverse\r\nsquare of the distance. Thus there would be a position of stable\r\nequilibrium for the particles at a very small distance from each\r\nother, which may be, M. Mosotti suggests, that equilibrium on which\r\ntheir physical structure depends. According to this view, the\r\nresistance of bodies to compression and to extension, as well as the\r\nphenomena of statical electricity and the mutual gravitation of\r\nmatter, are accounted for by the same hypothesis of a single fluid\r\nor ether. A theory which offers a prospect of such a generalization\r\nis worth attention; but a very clear and comprehensive view of the\r\ndoctrines of several sciences is requisite to prepare us to estimate\r\nits value and probable success.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\11: _Sur les Forces qui régissent la Constitution\r\nIntérieure des Corps._ Turin. 1836.]\r\n\r\n_Question of the Material Reality of the Electric Fluid._--At first\r\nsight the beautiful accordance of the experiments with calculations\r\nfounded upon the attractions and repulsions of the two hypothetical\r\nfluids, persuade us that the hypotheses must be the real state of\r\nthings. But we have already learned that we must not trust to such\r\nevidence too readily. It is a curious instance of the mutual\r\ninfluence of the histories of two provinces of science, but I think\r\nit will be allowed to be just, to say that the discovery of the\r\npolarization of heat has done much to shake the theory of the\r\nelectric fluids as a physical reality. For the doctrine of a\r\nmaterial caloric appeared to be proved (from the laws of conduction\r\nand radiation) by the same kind of mathematical evidence (the\r\nagreement of laws respecting the elementary actions with those of\r\nfluids), which we have for the doctrine of material electricity. Yet\r\nwe now seem to see that heat cannot be matter, since its rays have\r\n_sides_, in a manner in which a stream of particles of matter cannot\r\nhave sides without inadmissible hypotheses. We see, then, that it\r\nwill not be contrary to precedent, if our electrical theory,\r\nrepresenting with perfect accuracy the _laws_ of the actions, in all\r\ntheir forms, simple and complex, should yet be fallacious as a view\r\nof the _cause_ of the actions.\r\n\r\nAny true view of electricity must include, or at least be consistent\r\nwith, the other classes of the phenomena, as well as this statical\r\nelectrical action; such as the conditions of excitation and\r\nretention of {213} electricity; to which we may add, the connexion\r\nof electricity with magnetism and with chemistry;--a vast field, as\r\nyet dimly seen. Now, even with regard to the simplest of these\r\nquestions, the cause of the retention of electricity at the surface\r\nof bodies, it appears to be impossible to maintain Coulomb's\r\nopinion, that this is effected by the resistance of air to the\r\npassage of electricity. The other questions are such as Coulomb did\r\nnot attempt to touch; they refer, indeed, principally to laws not\r\nsuspected at his time. How wide and profound a theory must be which\r\ndeals worthily with these, we shall obtain some indications in the\r\nsucceeding part of our history.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said on the other side, that we have the evidence of\r\nour senses for the reality of an electric fluid;--we see it in the\r\nspark; we hear it in the explosion; we feel it in the shock; and it\r\nproduces the effects of mechanical violence, piercing and tearing\r\nthe bodies through which it passes. And those who are disposed to\r\nassert a real fluid on such grounds, may appear to be justified in\r\ndoing so, by one of Newton's \"Rules of Philosophizing,\" in which he\r\ndirects the philosopher to assume, in his theories, \"causes which\r\nare true.\" The usual interpretation of a \"vera causa,\" has been,\r\nthat it implies causes which, independently of theoretical\r\ncalculations, are known to exist by their mechanical effects; as\r\ngravity was familiarly known to exist on the earth, before it was\r\nextended to the heavens. The electric fluid might seem to be such a\r\n_vera causa_.\r\n\r\nTo this I should venture to reply, that this reasoning shows how\r\ndelusive the Newtonian rule, so interpreted, may be. For a moment's\r\nconsideration will satisfy us that none of the circumstances, above\r\nadduced, can really prove material currents, rather than vibrations,\r\nor other modes of agency. The spark and shock are quite insufficient\r\nto supply such a proof. Sound is vibrations,--light is vibrations;\r\nvibrations may affect our nerves, and may rend a body, as when\r\nglasses are broken by sounds. Therefore all these supposed\r\nindications of the reality of the electric fluid are utterly\r\nfallacious. In truth, this mode of applying Newton's rule consists\r\nin elevating our first rude and unscientific impressions into a\r\nsupremacy over the results of calculation, generalization, and\r\nsystematic induction.[**39\\11] {214}\r\n\r\n[Note **39\\11: On the subject of this Newtonian Rule of\r\nPhilosophizing, see further _Phil. Ind. Sc._ B. xii. c. 13. I have\r\ngiven an account of the history and evidence of the Theory of\r\nElectricity in the _Reports of the British Association_ for 1835.\r\nI may seem there to have spoken more favorably of the Theory as a\r\nPhysical Theory than I have done here. This difference is\r\nprincipally due to a consideration of the present aspect of the\r\nTheory of Heat.]\r\n\r\nThus our conclusion with regard to this subject is, that if we wish\r\nto form a stable physical theory of electricity, we must take into\r\naccount not only the laws of statical electricity, which we have\r\nbeen chiefly considering, but the laws of other kinds of agency,\r\ndifferent from the electric, yet connected with it. For the\r\nelectricity of which we have hitherto spoken, and which is commonly\r\nexcited by friction, is identical with galvanic action, which is a\r\nresult of chemical combinations, and belongs to chemical philosophy.\r\nThe connexion of these different kinds of electricity with one\r\nanother leads us into a new domain; but we must, in the first place,\r\nconsider their mechanical laws. We now proceed to another branch of\r\nthe same subject, Magnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{215}}\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MECHANICO-CHEMICAL SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n(CONTINUED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EFFICE, ut interea fera munera militiaï\r\n  Per maria ac terras omneis sopita quiescant.\r\n  Nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace juvare\r\n  Mortales; quoniam belli fera munera Mavors\r\n  Armipotens regit, in gremium qui sæpe tuum se\r\n  Rejicit, æterno devictus vulnere amoris;\r\n  Atque ita suspiciens tereti cervice reposta,\r\n  Pascit amore avidos inhians in te, Dea, visus,\r\n  Eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore.\r\n  Hunc tu, Diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto\r\n  Circumfusa super, suaves ex ore loquelas\r\n  Funde, petens placidam Romanis, incluta, pacem.\r\n          LUCRET. i. 31.\r\n\r\n  O charming Goddess, whose mysterious sway\r\n  The unseen hosts of earth and sky obey;\r\n  To whom, though cold and hard to all besides,\r\n  The Iron God by strong affection glides.\r\n  Flings himself eager to thy close embrace,\r\n  And bends his head to gaze upon thy face;\r\n  Do thou, what time thy fondling arms are thrown\r\n  Around his form, and he is all thy own,\r\n  Do thou, thy Rome to save, thy power to prove,\r\n  Beg him to grant a boon for thy dear love;\r\n  Beg him no more in battle-fields to deal.\r\n  Or crush the nations with his mailed heel.\r\n  But, touched and softened by a worthy flame,\r\n  Quit sword and spear, and seek a better fame.\r\n  Bid him to make all war and slaughter cease,\r\n  And ply his genuine task in arts of peace;\r\n  And by thee guided o'er the trackless surge,\r\n  Bear wealth and joy to ocean's farthest verge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{217}}\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF LAWS OF MAGNETIC PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE history of Magnetism is in a great degree similar to that of\r\nElectricity, and many of the same persons were employed in the two\r\ntrains of research. The general fact, that the magnet attracts iron,\r\nwas nearly all that was known to the ancients, and is frequently\r\nmentioned and referred to; for instance, by Pliny, who wonders and\r\ndeclaims concerning it, in his usual exaggerated style.[1\\12] The\r\nwriters of the Stationary Period, in this subject as in others,\r\nemployed themselves in collecting and adorning a number of\r\nextravagant tales, which the slightest reference to experiment would\r\nhave disproved; as, for example, that a magnet, when it has lost its\r\nvirtue, has it restored by goat's blood. Gilbert, whose work _De\r\nMagnete_ we have already mentioned, speaks with becoming indignation\r\nand pity of this bookish folly, and repeatedly asserts the paramount\r\nvalue of experiments. He himself, no doubt, acted up to his own\r\nprecepts; for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the\r\nscience, so fully examined indeed, that even at this day we have\r\nlittle to add to them. Thus, in his first Book, the subjects of the\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth Chapters are,--that the magnet has\r\npoles,--that we may call these poles the north and the south\r\npole,--that in two magnets the north pole of each attracts the south\r\npole and repels the north pole of the other. This is, indeed, the\r\ncardinal fact on which our generalizations rest; and the reader will\r\nperceive at once its resemblance to the leading phenomena of\r\nstatical electricity.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\12: _Hist. Nat._ lib. xxxvi. c. 25.]\r\n\r\nBut the doctrines of magnetism, like those of heat, have an\r\nadditional claim on our notice from the manner in which they are\r\nexemplified in the globe of the earth. The subject of _terrestrial\r\nmagnetism_ forms a very important addition to the general facts of\r\nmagnetic attraction and repulsion. The property of the magnet by\r\nwhich it directs its poles exactly or nearly north and south, when\r\nonce discovered, was of immense importance to the mariner. It does\r\nnot {218} appear easy to trace with certainty the period of this\r\ndiscovery. Passing over certain legends of the Chinese, as at any\r\nrate not bearing upon the progress of European science,[2\\12] the\r\nearliest notice of this property appears to be contained in the Poem\r\nof Guyot de Provence, who describes the needle as being magnetized,\r\nand then placed in or on a straw, (floating on water, as I presume:)\r\n  Puis se torne la pointe toute\r\n  Contre l'estoile sans doute;\r\nthat is, it turns towards the pole-star. This account would make the\r\nknowledge of this property in Europe anterior to 1200. It was\r\nafterwards found[3\\12] that the needle does not point exactly\r\ntowards the north. Gilbert was aware of this deviation, which he\r\ncalls the _variation_, and also, that it is different in different\r\nplaces.[4\\12] He maintained on theoretical principles also,[5\\12]\r\nthat at the same place the variation is constant; probably in his\r\ntime there were not any recorded observations by which the truth of\r\nthis assertion could be tested; it was afterwards found to be false.\r\nThe alteration of the variation in proceeding from one place to\r\nanother was, it will be recollected, one of the circumstances which\r\nmost alarmed the companions of Columbus in 1492. Gilbert says,[6\\12]\r\n\"Other learned men have, in long navigations, observed the\r\ndifferences of magnetic variations, as Thomas Hariot, Robert Hues,\r\nEdward Wright, Abraham Kendall, all Englishmen: others have invented\r\nmagnetic instruments and convenient modes of observation, such as\r\nare requisite for those who take long voyages, as William Borough in\r\nhis Book concerning the variation of the compass, William Barlo in\r\nhis supplement, William Norman in his _New Attractive_. This is that\r\nRobert Norman (a good seaman and an ingenious artificer,) who first\r\ndiscovered the _dip_ of magnetic iron.\" This important discovery was\r\nmade[7\\12] in 1576. From the time when the difference of the\r\nvariation of the compass in different places became known, it was\r\nimportant to mariners to register the variation in all parts of the\r\nworld. Halley was appointed to the command of a ship in the Royal\r\nNavy by the Government of William and Mary, with orders \"to seek by\r\nobservation the discovery of the rule for the variation of the\r\ncompass.\" He published Magnetic Charts, which {219} have been since\r\ncorrected and improved by various persons. The most recent are those\r\nof Mr. Yates in 1817, and of M. Hansteen. The dip, as well as the\r\nvariation, was found to be different in different places. M.\r\nHumboldt, in the course of his travels, collected many such\r\nobservations. And both the observations of variation and of dip\r\nseemed to indicate that the earth, as to its effect on the magnetic\r\nneedle, may, approximately at least, be considered as a magnet, the\r\npoles of which are not far removed from the earth's poles of\r\nrotation. Thus we have a _magnetic equator_, in which the needle has\r\nno dip, and which does not deviate far from the earth's equator;\r\nalthough, from the best observations, it appears to be by no means a\r\nregular circle. And the phenomena, both of the dip and of the\r\nvariation, in high northern latitudes, appear to indicate the\r\nexistence of a pole below the surface of the earth to the north of\r\nHudson's Bay. In his second remarkable expedition into those\r\nregions, Captain Ross is supposed to have reached the place of this\r\npole; the dipping-needle there pointing vertically downwards, and\r\nthe variation-compass turning towards this point in the adjacent\r\nregions. We shall hereafter have to consider the more complete and\r\nconnected views which have been taken of terrestrial magnetism.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\12: _Enc. Met._ art. _Magnetism_, p. 736.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\12: Before 1269. _Enc. Met._ p. 737.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\12: _De Magnete_, lib. iv. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\12: c. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\12: Lib. i. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\12: _Enc. Met._ p. 738.]\r\n\r\nIn 1633, Gellibrand discovered that the variation is not constant,\r\nas Gilbert imagined, but that at London it had diminished from\r\neleven degrees east in 1580, to four degrees in 1633. Since that\r\ntime the variation has become more and more westerly; it is now\r\nabout twenty-five degrees west, and the needle is supposed to have\r\nbegun to travel eastward again.\r\n\r\nThe next important fact which appeared with respect to terrestrial\r\nmagnetism was, that the position of the needle is subject to a small\r\n_diurnal_ variation: this was discovered in 1722, by Graham, a\r\nphilosophical instrument-maker, of London. The daily variation was\r\nestablished by one thousand observations of Graham, and confirmed by\r\nfour thousand more made by Canton, and is now considered to be out\r\nof dispute. It appeared also, by Canton's researches, that the\r\ndiurnal variation undergoes an annual inequality, being nearly a\r\nquarter of a degree in June and July, and only half that quantity in\r\nDecember and January.\r\n\r\nHaving thus noticed the principal facts which belong to terrestrial\r\nmagnetism, we must return to the consideration of those phenomena\r\nwhich gradually led to a consistent magnetic theory. Gilbert\r\nobserved that both smelted iron and hammered iron have the magnetic\r\nvirtue, {220} though in a weaker degree than the magnet\r\nitself,[8\\12] and he asserted distinctly that the magnet is merely\r\nan ore of iron, (lib. i. c. 16, Quod magnes et vena ferri idem\r\nsunt.) He also noted the increased energy which magnets acquire by\r\nbeing _armed_; that is, fitted with a cap of polished iron at each\r\npole.[9\\12] But we do not find till a later period any notice of the\r\ndistinction which exists between the magnetical properties of soft\r\niron and of hard steel;--the latter being susceptible of being\r\nformed into _artificial magnets_, with permanent poles; while soft\r\niron is only _passively magnetic_, receiving a temporary polarity\r\nfrom the action of a magnet near it, but losing this property when\r\nthe magnet is removed. About the middle of the last century, various\r\nmethods were devised of making artificial magnets, which exceeded in\r\npower all magnetic bodies previously known.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\12: Lib. i. c. 9-13.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\12: Lib. ii. c. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining experimental researches had so close an historical\r\nconnexion with the theory, that they will be best considered along\r\nwith it, and to that, therefore, we now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF MAGNETIC THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF MAGNETIC ACTION.--The assumption of a fluid, as a mode of\r\nexplaining the phenomena, was far less obvious in magnetic than in\r\nelectric cases, yet it was soon arrived at. After the usual\r\nphilosophy of the middle ages, the \"forms\" of Aquinas, the \"efflux\"\r\nof Cusanus, the \"vapors\" of Costæus, and the like, which are\r\nrecorded by Gilbert,[10\\12] we have his own theory, which he also\r\nexpresses by ascribing the effects to a \"formal efficiency;\"--a\r\n\"_form_ of primary globes; the proper entity and existence of their\r\nhomogeneous parts, which we may call a primary and radical and\r\nastral _form_;\"--of which forms there is one in the sun, one in the\r\nmoon, one in the earth, the latter being the magnetic virtue.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\12: Gilb. lib. ii. c. 3, 4]\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to analyse the precise import of these expressions,\r\nwe may proceed to Descartes's explanation of magnetic phenomena. The\r\nmode in which he presents this subject[11\\12] is, perhaps, the {221}\r\nmost persuasive of his physical attempts. If a magnet be placed among\r\niron filings, these arrange themselves in curved lines, which proceed\r\nfrom one pole of the magnet to the other. It was not difficult to\r\nconceive these to be the traces of currents of ethereal matter which\r\ncirculate through the magnet, and which are thus rendered sensible\r\neven to the eye. When phenomena could not be explained by means of one\r\nvortex, several were introduced. Three Memoirs on Magnetism, written\r\non such principles, had the prize adjudged[12\\12] by the French\r\nAcademy of Sciences in 1746.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\12: _Prin. Phil._ pars c. iv. 146.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\12: Coulomb, 1789, p. 482.]\r\n\r\nBut the Cartesian philosophy gradually declined; and it was not\r\ndifficult to show that the _magnetic curves_, as well as other\r\nphenomena, would, in fact, result from the attraction and repulsion\r\nof two poles. The analogy of magnetism with electricity was so\r\nstrong and clear, that similar theories were naturally proposed for\r\nthe two sets of facts; the distinction of bodies into conductors and\r\nelectrics in the one case, corresponding to the distinction of soft\r\nand hard steel, in their relations to magnetism. Æpinus published a\r\ntheory of magnetism and electricity at the same time (1759); and the\r\nformer theory, like the latter, explained the phenomena of the\r\nopposite poles as results of the excess and defect of a magnetic\r\n\"fluid,\" which was dislodged and accumulated in the ends of the\r\nbody, by the repulsion of its own particles, and by the attraction\r\nof iron or steel, as in the case of induced electricity. The Æpinian\r\ntheory of magnetism, as of electricity, was recast by Coulomb, and\r\npresented in a new shape, with two fluids instead of one. But before\r\nthis theory was reduced to calculation, it was obviously desirable,\r\nin the first place, to determine the law of force.\r\n\r\nIn magnetic, as in electric action, the determination of the law of\r\nattraction of the particles was attended at first with some\r\ndifficulty, because the action which a finite magnet exerts is a\r\ncompound result of the attractions and repulsions of many points.\r\nNewton had imagined the attractive force of magnetism to be\r\ninversely as the cube of the distance; but Mayer in 1760, and\r\nLambert a few years later, asserted the law to be, in this as in\r\nother forces, the inverse square. Coulomb has the merit of having\r\nfirst clearly confirmed this law, by the use of his\r\ntorsion-balance.[13\\12] He established, at the same time, other very\r\nimportant facts, for instance, \"that the directive magnetic force,\r\nwhich the earth exerts upon a needle, is a constant quantity,\r\nparallel {222} to the magnetic meridian, and passing through the\r\nsame point of the needle whatever be its position.\" This was the\r\nmore important, because it was necessary, in the first place, to\r\nallow for the effect of the terrestrial force, before the mutual\r\naction of the magnets could be extricated from the phenomena.[14\\12]\r\nCoulomb then proceeded to correct the theory of magnetism.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\12: _Mem. A. P._ 1784, 2d Mem. p. 593.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\12: p. 603.]\r\n\r\nCoulomb's reform of the Æpinian theory, in the case of magnetism, as\r\nin that of electricity, substituted two fluids (an _austral_ and a\r\n_boreal_ fluid,) for the single fluid; and in this way removed the\r\nnecessity under which Æpinus found himself, of supposing all the\r\nparticles of iron and steel and other magnetic bodies to have a\r\npeculiar repulsion for each other, exactly equal to their attraction\r\nfor the magnetic fluid. But in the case of magnetism, another\r\nmodification was necessary. It was impossible to suppose here, as in\r\nthe electrical phenomena, that one of the fluids was accumulated on\r\none extremity of a body, and the other fluid on the other extremity;\r\nfor though this might appear, at first sight, to be the case in a\r\nmagnetic needle, it was found that when the needle was cut into two\r\nhalves, the half in which the austral fluid had seemed to\r\npredominate, acquired immediately a boreal pole opposite to its\r\naustral pole, and a similar effect followed in the other half. The\r\nsame is true, into however many parts the magnetic body be cut. The\r\nway in which Coulomb modified the theory so as to reconcile it with\r\nsuch facts, is simple and satisfactory. He supposes[15\\12] the\r\nmagnetic body to be made up of \"molecules or integral parts,\" or, as\r\nthey were afterwards called by M. Poisson, \"magnetic elements.\" In\r\neach of these elements, (which are extremely minute,) the fluids can\r\nbe separated, so that each element has an austral and a boreal pole;\r\nbut the austral pole of an element which is adjacent to the boreal\r\npole of the next, neutralizes, or nearly neutralizes, its effect; so\r\nthat the sensible magnetism appears only towards the extremities of\r\nthe body, as it would do if the fluids could permeate the body\r\nfreely. We shall have exactly the same result, as to sensible\r\nmagnetic force, on the one supposition and on the other, as Coulomb\r\nshowed.[16\\12]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\12: _Mem. A. P._ 1789, p. 488.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\12: _Mem. A. P._ p. 492.]\r\n\r\nThe theory, thus freed from manifest incongruities, was to be\r\nreduced to calculation, and compared with experiment; this was done\r\nin Coulomb's Seventh Memoir.[17\\12] The difficulties of calculation\r\nin this, as in the electric problem, could not be entirely\r\nsurmounted by the analysis of Coulomb; but by various artifices, he\r\nobtained theoretically the {223} relative amount of magnetism at\r\nseveral points of a needle,[18\\12] and the proposition that the\r\ndirective force of the earth on similar needles saturated with\r\nmagnetism, was as the cube of their dimensions; conclusions which\r\nagreed with experiment.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\12: _A. P._ 1789.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\12: p. 485.]\r\n\r\nThe agreement thus obtained was sufficient to give a great\r\nprobability to the theory; but an improvement of the methods of\r\ncalculation and a repetition of experiments, was, in this as in\r\nother cases, desirable, as a confirmation of the labors of the\r\noriginal theorist. These requisites, in the course of time, were\r\nsupplied. The researches of Laplace and Legendre on the figure of\r\nthe earth had (as we have already stated,) introduced some very\r\npeculiar analytical artifices, applicable to the attractions of\r\nspheroids; and these methods were employed by M. Biot in 1811, to\r\nshow that on an elliptical spheroid, the thickness of the fluid in\r\nthe direction of the radius would be as the distance from the\r\ncentre.[19\\12] But the subject was taken up in a more complete\r\nmanner in 1824 by M. Poisson, who obtained general expressions for\r\nthe attractions or repulsions of a body of any form whatever,\r\nmagnetized by influence, upon a given point; and in the case of\r\nspherical bodies was able completely to solve the equations which\r\ndetermine these forces.[20\\12]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\12: _Bull. des Sc._ No. li.]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\12: _A. P._ for 1821 and 2, published 1826.]\r\n\r\nPreviously to these theoretical investigations, Mr. Barlow had made\r\na series of experiments on the effect of an iron sphere upon a\r\ncompass needle; and had obtained empirical formulæ for the amount of\r\nthe deviation of the needle, according to its dependence upon the\r\nposition and magnitude of the sphere. He afterwards deduced the same\r\nformulæ from a theory which was, in fact, identical with that of\r\nCoulomb, but which he considered as different, in that it supposed\r\nthe magnetic fluids to be entirely collected at the surface of the\r\nsphere. He had indeed found, by experiment, that the surface was the\r\nonly part in which there was any sensible magnetism; and that a thin\r\nshell of iron would produce the same effect as a solid ball of the\r\nsame diameter.\r\n\r\nBut this was, in fact, a most complete verification of Coulomb's\r\ntheory. For though that theory did not suppose the magnetism to be\r\ncollected solely at the surface, as Mr. Barlow found it, it followed\r\nfrom the theory, that the _sensible_ magnetic intensity assumed the\r\nsame distribution (namely, a surface distribution,) as if the fluids\r\ncould permeate the whole body, instead of the \"magnetic elements\"\r\nonly. Coulomb, indeed, had not expressly noticed the result, that\r\nthe sensible {224} magnetism would be confined to the surface of\r\nbodies; but he had found that, in a long needle, the magnetic fluid\r\nmight be supposed to be concentrated very near the extremities, just\r\nas it is in a long electric body. The theoretical confirmation of\r\nthis rule among the other consequences of the theory,--that the\r\nsensible magnetism would be collected at the surface,--was one of\r\nthe results of Poisson's analysis. For it appeared that if the sum\r\nof the electric elements of the body was equal to the whole body,\r\nthere would be no difference between the action of a solid sphere\r\nand very thin shell.\r\n\r\nWe may, then, consider the Coulombian theory to be fully established\r\nand verified, as a representation of the laws of magnetical\r\nphenomena. We may add, as a remarkable and valuable example of an\r\nulterior step in the course of sciences, the application of the laws\r\nof the distribution of magnetism to the purposes of navigation. It\r\nhad been found that the mass of iron which exists in a ship produces\r\na deviation in the direction of the compass-needle, which was termed\r\n\"local attraction,\" and which rendered the compass an erroneous\r\nguide. Mr. Barlow proposed to correct this by a plate of iron placed\r\nnear the compass; the plate being of comparatively small mass, but,\r\nin consequence of its expanded form, and its proximity to the\r\nneedle, of equivalent effect to the disturbing cause.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [This proposed arrangement was not successful, because as\r\nthe ship turns into different positions, it may be considered as\r\nrevolving round a vertical axis; and as this does not coincide with\r\nthe magnetic axis, the relative magnetic position of the disturbing\r\nparts of the ship, and of the correcting plate, will be altered, so\r\nthat they will not continue to counteract each other. In high\r\nmagnetic latitudes the correcting plate was used with success.\r\n\r\nBut when iron ships became common, a correction of the effect of the\r\niron upon the ship's compass in the general case became necessary.\r\nMr. Airy devised the means of making this correction. By placing a\r\nmagnet and a mass of iron in certain positions relative to the\r\ncompass, the effect of the rest of the iron in the ship is\r\ncompletely counteracted in all positions.[21\\12]]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\12: See _Phil. Trans._ 1836.]\r\n\r\nBut we have still to trace the progress of the theory of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\n_Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism._--Gilbert had begun a plausible\r\ncourse of speculation on this point. \"We must reject,\" he\r\nsays,[22\\12] \"in {225} the first place, that vulgar opinion of\r\nrecent writers concerning magnetic mountains, or a certain magnetic\r\nrock, or an imaginary pole at a certain distance from the pole of\r\nthe earth.\" For, he adds, \"we learn by experience, that there is no\r\nsuch fixed pole or term in the earth for the variation.\" Gilbert\r\ndescribes the whole earth as a magnetic globe, and attributes the\r\nvariation to the irregular form of its protuberances, the solid\r\nparts only being magnetic. It was not easy to confirm or refute this\r\nopinion, but other hypotheses were tried by various writers; for\r\ninstance, Halley had imagined, from the forms of the lines of equal\r\nvariation, that there must be four magnetic poles; but Euler[23\\12]\r\nshowed that the \"Halleian lines\" would, for the most part, result\r\nfrom the supposition of two magnetic poles, and assigned their\r\nposition so as to represent pretty well the known state of the\r\nvariation all over the world in 1744. But the variation was not the\r\nonly phenomenon which required to be taken into account; the dip at\r\ndifferent places, and also the intensity of the force, were to be\r\nconsidered. We have already mentioned M. de Humboldt's collection of\r\nobservations of the dip. These were examined by M. Biot, with the\r\nview of reducing them to the action of two poles in the supposed\r\nterrestrial magnetic axis. Having, at first, made the distance of\r\nthese poles from the centre of the earth indefinite, he found that\r\nhis formulæ agreed more and more nearly with the observations, as\r\nthe poles were brought nearer; and that fact and theory coincided\r\ntolerably well when both poles were at the centre. In 1809,[24\\12]\r\nKrafft simplified this result, by showing that, on this supposition,\r\nthe tangent of the dip was twice the tangent of the latitude of the\r\nplace as measured from the magnetic equator. But M. Hansteen, who\r\nhas devoted to the subject of terrestrial magnetism a great amount\r\nof labor and skill, has shown that, taking together all the\r\nobservations which we possess, we are compelled to suppose four\r\nmagnetic poles; two near the north pole, and two near the south\r\npole, of the terrestrial globe; and that these poles, no two of\r\nwhich are exactly opposite each other, are all in motion, with\r\ndifferent velocities, some moving to the east and some to the west.\r\nThis curious collection of facts awaits the hand of future\r\ntheorists, when the ripeness of time shall invite them to the task.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\12: Lib. iv. c. 1. _De Variatione._]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\12: _Ac. Berlin_, 1757.]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\12: _Enc. Met._ p. 742.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I had thus written in the first edition. The theorist who\r\nwas needed to reduce this accumulation of facts to their laws, {226}\r\nhad already laid his powerful hand upon them; namely, M. Gauss, a\r\nmathematician not inferior to any of the great men who completed the\r\ntheory of gravitation. And institutions had been established for\r\nextending the collection of the facts pertaining to it, on a scale\r\nwhich elevates Magnetism into a companionship with Astronomy. M.\r\nHansteen's _Magnetismus der Erde_ was published in 1819. His\r\nconclusions respecting the position of the four magnetic \"poles\"\r\nexcited so much interest in his own country, that the Norwegian\r\n_Storthing_, or parliament, by a unanimous vote, provided funds for\r\na magnetic expedition which he was to conduct along the north of\r\nEurope and Asia; and this they did at the very time when they\r\nrefused to make a grant to the king for building a palace at\r\nChristiania. The expedition was made in 1828-30, and verified\r\nHansteen's anticipations as to the existence of a region of magnetic\r\nconvergence in Siberia, which he considered as indicating a \"pole\"\r\nto the north of that country. M. Erman also travelled round the\r\nearth at the same time, making magnetic observations.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time another magnetical phenomenon attracted\r\nattention. Besides the general motion of the magnetic poles, and the\r\ndiurnal movements of the needle, it was found that small and\r\nirregular disturbances take place in its position, which M. de\r\nHumboldt termed _magnetic storms_. And that which excited a strong\r\ninterest on this subject was the discovery that these magnetic\r\nstorms, seen only by philosophers who watch the needle with\r\nmicroscopic exactness, rage simultaneously over large tracts of the\r\nsurface of our globe. This was detected about 1825 by a comparison\r\nof the observations of M. Arago at Paris with simultaneous\r\nobservations of M. Kupffer at Kasan in Russia, distant more than 47\r\ndegrees of longitude.\r\n\r\nAt the instance of M. de Humboldt, the Imperial Academy of Russia\r\nadopted with zeal the prosecution of this inquiry, and formed a chain\r\nof magnetic stations across the whole of the Russian empire. Magnetic\r\nobservations were established at Petersburg and at Kasan, and\r\ncorresponding observations were made at Moscow, at Nicolaieff in the\r\nCrimea, and Barnaoul and Nertchinsk in Siberia, at Sitka in Russian\r\nAmerica, and even at Pekin. To these magnetic stations the Russian\r\ngovernment afterwards added, Catharineburg in Russia Proper,\r\nHelsingfors in Finland, Teflis in Georgia. A comparison of the results\r\nobtained at four of these stations made by MM. de Humboldt and Dove,\r\nin the year 1830, showed that the magnetic disturbances were\r\nsimultaneous, and were for the most parallel in their progress. {227}\r\n\r\nImportant steps in the prosecution of this subject were soon after\r\nmade by M. Gauss, the great mathematician of Göttingen. He contrived\r\ninstruments and modes of observation far more perfect than any\r\nbefore employed, and organized a system of comparative observations\r\nthroughout Europe. In 1835, stations for this purpose were\r\nestablished at Altona, Augsburg, Berlin, Breda, Breslau, Copenhagen,\r\nDublin, Freiberg, Göttingen, Greenwich, Hanover, Leipsic, Marburg,\r\nMilan, Munich, Petersburg, Stockholm, and Upsala. At these places,\r\nsix times in the year, observations were taken simultaneously, at\r\nintervals of five minutes for 24 hours. The _Results of the Magnetic\r\nAssociation_ (Resultaten des Magnetischen Vereins) were published by\r\nMM. Gauss and Weber, beginning in 1836.\r\n\r\nBritish physicists did not at first take any leading part in these\r\nplans. But in 1836, Baron Humboldt, who by his long labors and\r\nimportant discoveries in this subject might be considered as\r\npeculiarly entitled to urge its claims, addressed a letter to the\r\nDuke of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, asking for the\r\nco-operation of this country in so large and hopeful a scheme for\r\nthe promotion of science. The Royal Society willingly entertained\r\nthis appeal; and the progress of the cause was still further\r\npromoted when it was zealously taken up by the British Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science, assembled at Newcastle in 1838. The\r\nAssociation there expressed its strong interest in the German system\r\nof magnetic observations; and at the instigation of this body, and\r\nof the Royal Society, four complete magnetical observatories were\r\nestablished by the British government, at Toronto, St. Helena, the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen's Land. The munificence of the\r\nDirectors of the East India Company founded and furnished an equal\r\nnumber at Simla (in the Himalayah), Madras, Bombay, and Sincapore.\r\nSir Thomas Brisbane added another at his own expense at Kelso, in\r\nScotland. Besides this, the government sent out a naval expedition\r\nto make discoveries (magnetic among others), in the Antarctic\r\nregions, under the command of Sir James Ross. Other states lent\r\ntheir assistance also, and founded or reorganized their magnetic\r\nobservatories. Besides those already mentioned, one was established\r\nby the French government at Algiers; one by the Belgian, at\r\nBrussels; two by Austria, at Prague and Milan; one by Prussia, at\r\nBreslau; one by Bavaria, at Munich; one by Spain, at Cadiz; there\r\nare two in the United States, at Philadelphia and Cambridge; one at\r\nCairo, founded by the Pasha of Egypt; and in India, one at\r\nTrevandrum, established by the Rajah of Travancore; and one by {228}\r\nthe King of Oude, at Lucknow. At all these distant stations the same\r\nplan was followed out, by observations strictly simultaneous, made\r\naccording to the same methods, with the same instrumental means.\r\nSuch a scheme, combining world-wide extent with the singleness of\r\naction of an individual mind, is hitherto without parallel.\r\n\r\nAt first, the British stations were established for three years\r\nonly; but it was thought advisable to extend this period three years\r\nlonger, to end in 1845. And when the termination of that period\r\narrived, a discussion was held among the magneticians themselves,\r\nwhether it was better to continue the observations still, or to\r\nexamine and compare the vast mass of observations already collected,\r\nso as to see to what results and improvements of methods they\r\npointed. This question was argued at the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Cambridge in that year; and the conference ended in\r\nthe magneticians requesting to have the observations continued, at\r\nsome of the observatories for an indefinite period, at others, till\r\nthe year 1848. In the mean time the Antarctic expedition had brought\r\nback a rich store of observations, fitted to disclose the magnetic\r\ncondition of those regions which it had explored. These were\r\n_discussed_, and their results exhibited, in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1843, by Col. Sabine, who had himself at various\r\nperiods, made magnetic observations in the Arctic regions, and in\r\nseveral remote parts of the globe, and had always been a zealous\r\nlaborer in this fruitful field. The general mass of the observations\r\nwas placed under the management of Professor Lloyd, of Dublin, who\r\nhas enriched the science of magnetism with several valuable\r\ninstruments and methods, and who, along with Col. Sabine, made a\r\nmagnetic survey of the British Isles in 1835 and 1836.\r\n\r\nI do not dwell upon magnetic surveys of various countries made by\r\nmany excellent observers; as MM. Quetelet, Forbes, Fox, Bache and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe facts observed at each station were, the _intensity_ of the\r\nmagnetic force; the _declination_ of the needle from the meridian,\r\nsometimes called the _variation_; and its _inclination_ to the\r\nhorizon, _the dip_;--or at least, some elements equivalent to these.\r\nThe values of these elements at any given time, if known, can be\r\nexpressed by charts of the earth's surface, on which are drawn the\r\n_isodynamic_, _isogonal_, and _isoclinal_ curves. The second of\r\nthese kinds of charts contain the \"Halleian lines\" spoken of in a\r\nprevious page. Moreover the magnetic elements at each place are to\r\nbe observed in such a {229} manner as to determine both their\r\n_periodical_ variations (the changes which occur in the period of a\r\nday, and of a year), the _secular_ changes, as the gradual increase\r\nor diminution of the declination at the same place for many years;\r\nand the _irregular_ fluctuations which, as we have said, are\r\nsimultaneous over a large part, or the whole, of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nWhen these Facts have been ascertained over the whole extent of the\r\nearth's surface, we shall still have to inquire what is the Cause of\r\nthe changes in the forces which these phenomena disclose. But as a\r\nbasis for all speculation on that subject, we must know the law of the\r\nphenomena, and of the forces which immediately produce them. I have\r\nalready said that Euler tried to account for the Halleian lines by\r\nmeans of _two_ magnetic \"poles,\" but that M. Hansteen conceived it\r\nnecessary to assume _four_. But an entirely new light has been thrown\r\nupon this subject by the beautiful investigations of Gauss, in his\r\n_Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism_, published in 1839. He remarks that\r\nthe term \"poles,\" as used by his predecessors, involves an assumption\r\narbitrary, and, as it is now found, false; namely, that certain\r\ndefinite points, two, four, or more, acting according to the laws of\r\nordinary magnetical poles, will explain the phenomena. He starts from\r\na more comprehensive assumption, that magnetism is distributed\r\nthroughout the mass of the earth in an unknown manner. On this\r\nassumption he obtains a function _V_, by the differentials of which\r\nthe elements of the magnetic force at any point will be expressed.\r\nThis function _V_ is well known in physical astronomy, and is obtained\r\nby summing all the elements of magnetic force in each particle, each\r\nmultiplied by the reciprocal of its distance; or as we may express it,\r\nby taking the sum of each element and its proximity jointly. Hence it\r\nhas been proposed[25\\12] to term this function the \"_integral\r\nproximity_\" of the attracting mass.[26\\12] By using the most refined\r\n{230} mathematical artifices for deducing the values of _V_ and its\r\ndifferentials in converging series, he is able to derive the\r\ncoefficients of these series from the observed magnetic elements at\r\ncertain places, and hence, to calculate them for all places. The\r\ncomparison of the calculation with the observed results is, of course,\r\nthe test of the truth of the theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\12: _Quart. Rev._ No. 131, p. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\12: The function V is of constant occurrence in\r\ninvestigations respecting attractions. It is introduced by Laplace\r\nin his investigations respecting the attractions of spheroids, _Méc.\r\nCél._ Livr. III. Art. 4. Mr. Green and Professor Mac Cullagh have\r\nproposed to term this function the _Potential_ of the system; but\r\nthis term (though suggested, I suppose, by analogy with the\r\nsubstantive _Exponential_), does not appear convenient in its form.\r\nOn the other hand, the term _Integral Proximity_ does not indicate\r\nthat which gives the function its peculiar claim to distinction;\r\nnamely, that its differentials express the power or attraction of\r\nthe system. Perhaps _Integral Potentiality_, or _Integral\r\nAttractivity_, would be a term combining the recommendations of both\r\nthe others.]\r\n\r\nThe degree of convergence of the series depends upon the unknown\r\ndistribution of magnetism within the earth. \"If we could venture to\r\nassume,\" says M. Gauss, \"that the members have a sensible influence\r\nonly as far as the fourth order, complete observations from eight\r\npoints would be sufficient, theoretically considered, for the\r\ndetermination of the coefficients.\" And under certain limitations,\r\nmaking this assumption, as the best we can do at present, M. Gauss\r\nobtains from eight places, 24 coefficients (each supplying three\r\nelements), and hence calculates the magnetic elements (intensity,\r\nvariation and dip) at 91 places in all parts of the earth. He finds\r\nhis calculations approach the observed values with a degree of\r\nexactness which appears to be quite convincing as to the general\r\ntruth of his results; especially taking into account how entirely\r\nunlimited is his original hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most curious results of this investigation that\r\naccording to the most simple meaning which we can give to the term\r\n\"pole\" the earth has only _two_ magnetic poles; that is, two points\r\nwhere the direction of the magnetic force is vertical. And thus the\r\n_isogonal curves_ may be looked upon as _deformations_ of the curves\r\ndeduced by Euler from the supposition of two poles, the deformation\r\narising from this, that the earth does not contain a single definite\r\nmagnet, but irregularly diffused magnetical elements, which still\r\nhave collectively a distinct resemblance to a single magnet. And\r\ninstead of Hansteen's Siberian pole, we have a Siberian region in\r\nwhich the needles converge; but if the apparent convergence be\r\npursued it nowhere comes to a point; and the like is the case in the\r\nAntarctic region. When the 24 Gaussian elements at any time are\r\nknown the magnetic condition of the globe is known, just as the\r\nmechanical condition of the solar system is known, when we know the\r\nelements of the orbits of the satellites and planets and the mass of\r\neach. And the comparison of this magnetic condition of the globe at\r\ndistant periods of time cannot fail to supply materials for future\r\nresearches and speculations with regard to the agencies by which the\r\ncondition of the earth is determined. The condition of which we here\r\nspeak must necessarily be its _mechanico-chemical_ condition, being\r\nexpressed, as it will be, in terms of the mechanico-chemical\r\nsciences. The {231} investigations I have been describing belong to\r\nthe mechanical side of the subject: but when philosophers have to\r\nconsider the causes of the secular changes which are found to occur\r\nin this mechanical condition, they cannot fail to be driven to\r\nelectrical, that is, chemical agencies and laws.\r\n\r\nI can only allude to Gauss's investigations respecting the _Absolute\r\nMeasure_ of the Earth's Magnetic Force. To determine the ratio of the\r\nmagnetic force of the earth to that of a known magnet, Poisson\r\nproposed to observe the time of vibration of a second magnet. The\r\nmethod of Gauss, now universally adopted, consists in observing the\r\nposition of equilibrium of the second magnet when deflected by the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the business of magnetic observation has been\r\ntaken up by the governments of our time makes this by far the\r\ngreatest scientific undertaking which the world has ever seen. The\r\nresult will be that we shall obtain in a few years a knowledge of\r\nthe magnetic constitution of the earth which otherwise it might have\r\nrequired centuries to accumulate. The secular magnetic changes must\r\nstill require a long time to reduce to their laws of phenomena,\r\nexcept observation be anticipated or assisted by some happy\r\ndiscovery as to the cause of these changes. But besides the special\r\ngain to magnetic science by this great plan of joint action among\r\nthe nations of the earth, there is thereby a beginning made in the\r\nrecognition and execution of the duty of forwarding science in\r\ngeneral by national exertions. For at most of the magnetic\r\nobservatories, meteorological observations are also carried on; and\r\nsuch observations, being far more extensive, systematic, and\r\npermanent than those which have usually been made, can hardly fail\r\nto produce important additions to science. But at any rate they do\r\nfor science that which nations can do, and individuals cannot; and\r\nthey seek for scientific truths in a manner suitable to the respect\r\nnow professed for science and to the progress which its methods have\r\nmade. Nor are we to overlook the effect of such observations as\r\nmeans of training men in the pursuit of science. \"There is amongst\r\nus,\" says one of the magnetic observers, \"a growing recognition of\r\nthe importance, both for science and for practical life, of forming\r\nexact observers of nature. Hitherto astronomy alone has afforded a\r\nvery partial opportunity for the formation of fine observers, of\r\nwhich few could avail themselves. Experience has shown that magnetic\r\nobservations may serve as excellent training schools in this\r\nrespect.\"[27\\12]] {232}\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\12: _Letter_ of W. Weber. _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ 1845, p. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe various other circumstances which terrestrial magnetism\r\nexhibits,--the diurnal and annual changes of the position of the\r\ncompass-needle;--the larger secular change which affects it in the\r\ncourse of years;--the difference of intensity at different places,\r\nand other facts, have naturally occupied philosophers with the\r\nattempt to determine, both the laws of the phenomena and their\r\ncauses. But these attempts necessarily depend, not upon laws of\r\nstatical magnetism, such as they have been explained above; but upon\r\nthe laws by which the production and intensity of magnetism in\r\ndifferent cases are regulated;--laws which belong to a different\r\nprovince, and are related to a different set of principles. Thus,\r\nfor example, we have not attempted to explain the discovery of the\r\nlaws by which heat influences magnetism; and therefore we cannot now\r\ngive an account of those theories of the facts relating to\r\nterrestrial magnetism, which depend upon the influence of\r\ntemperature. The conditions of excitation of magnetism are best\r\nstudied by comparing this force with other cases where the same\r\neffects are produced by very different apparent agencies; such as\r\ngalvanic and thermo-electricity. To the history of these we shall\r\npresently proceed.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--The hypothesis of magnetic fluids, as physical\r\nrealities, was never widely or strongly embraced, as that of\r\nelectric fluids was. For though the hypothesis accounted, to a\r\nremarkable degree of exactness, for large classes of the phenomena,\r\nthe presence of a material fluid was not indicated by facts of a\r\ndifferent kind, such as the spark, the discharge from points, the\r\nshock, and its mechanical effects. Thus the belief of a peculiar\r\nmagnetic fluid or fluids was not forced upon men's minds; and the\r\ndoctrine above stated was probably entertained by most of its\r\nadherents, chiefly as a means of expressing the laws of phenomena in\r\ntheir elementary form.\r\n\r\nOne other observation occurs here. We have seen that the supposition\r\nof a fluid moveable from one part of bodies to another, and capable\r\nof accumulation in different parts of the surface, appeared at first\r\nto be as distinctly authorized by magnetic as by electric phenomena;\r\nand yet that it afterwards appeared, by calculation, that this must\r\nbe considered as a derivative result; no real transfer of fluid\r\ntaking place except within the limits of the insensible particles of\r\nthe body. Without attempting to found a formula of philosophizing on\r\nthis circumstance, we may observe, that this occurrence, like the\r\ndisproof of heat as a material fluid, shows the possibility of an\r\nhypothesis which shall very exactly satisfy many phenomena, and yet\r\nbe incomplete: it {233} shows, too, the necessity of bringing facts\r\nof all kinds to bear on the hypothesis; thus, in this case it was\r\nrequisite to take into account the facts of junction and separation\r\nof magnetic bodies, as well as their attractions and repulsions.\r\n\r\nIf we have seen reason to doubt the doctrine of electric fluids as\r\nphysical realities, we cannot help pronouncing upon the magnetic\r\nfluids as having still more insecure claims to a material existence,\r\neven on the grounds just stated. But we may add considerations still\r\nmore decisive; for at a further stage of discovery, as we shall see,\r\nmagnetic and electric action were found to be connected in the\r\nclosest manner, so as to lead to the persuasion of their being\r\ndifferent effects of one common cause. After those discoveries, no\r\nphilosopher would dream of assuming electric fluids and magnetic\r\nfluids as two distinct material agents. Yet even now the nature of\r\nthe dependence of magnetism upon any other cause is extremely\r\ndifficult to conceive. But till we have noticed some of the\r\ndiscoveries to which we have alluded, we cannot even speculate about\r\nthat dependence. We now, therefore, proceed to sketch the history of\r\nthese discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{235}}\r\nBOOK XIII.\r\n\r\n_MECHANICO-CHEMICAL SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n(CONTINUED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF GALVANISM,\r\nOR\r\nVOLTAIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Percusssæ gelido trepidant sub pectore fibræ,\r\n  Et nova desuetis subrepens vita medullis\r\n  Miscetur morti: tunc omnis palpitat artus\r\n  Tenduntur nervi; nec se tellure cadaver\r\n  Paullatim per membra levat; terrâque repulsum est\r\n  Erectumque simul.\r\n          LUCAN. vi. 752.\r\n\r\n  The form which lay before inert and dead,\r\n  Sudden a piercing thrill of change o'erspread;\r\n  Returning life gleams in the stony face,\r\n  The fibres quiver and the sinews brace,\r\n  Move the stiff limbs;--nor did the body rise\r\n  With tempered strength which genial life supplies,\r\n  But upright starting, its full stature held,\r\n  As though the earth the supine corse repelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{237}}\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have given the name of _mechanico-chemical_ to the class of\r\nsciences now under our consideration; for these sciences are\r\nconcerned with cases in which mechanical effects, that is,\r\nattractions and repulsions, are produced; while the conditions under\r\nwhich these effects occur, depend, as we shall hereafter see, on\r\nchemical relations. In that branch of these sciences which we have\r\njust treated of, Magnetism, the mechanical phenomena were obvious,\r\nbut their connexion with chemical causes was by no means apparent,\r\nand, indeed, has not yet come under our notice.\r\n\r\nThe subject to which we now proceed, Galvanism, belongs to the same\r\ngroup, but, at first sight, exhibits only the other, the chemical,\r\nportion of the features of the class; for the connexion of galvanic\r\nphenomena with chemical action was soon made out, but the mechanical\r\neffects which accompany them were not examined till the examination\r\nwas required by a new train of discovery. It is to be observed, that\r\nI do not include in the class of mechanical effects the convulsive\r\nmotions in the limbs of animals which are occasioned by galvanic\r\naction; for these movements are produced, not by attraction and\r\nrepulsion, but by muscular irritability; and though they indicate\r\nthe existence of a peculiar agency, cannot be used to measure its\r\nintensity and law.\r\n\r\nThe various examples of the class of agents which we here\r\nconsider,--magnetism, electricity, galvanism, electro-magnetism,\r\nthermo-electricity,--differ from each other principally in the\r\ncircumstances by which they are called into action; and these\r\ndifferences are in reality of a chemical nature, and will have to be\r\nconsidered when we come to treat of the inductive steps by which the\r\ngeneral principles of chemical theory are established. In the\r\npresent part of our task, therefore, we must take for granted the\r\nchemical conditions on which the excitation of these various kinds\r\nof action depends, and trace the history of the discovery of their\r\nmechanical laws only. This rule will much abridge the account we\r\nhave here to give of the progress of discovery in the provinces to\r\nwhich I have just referred. {238}\r\n\r\nThe first step in this career of discovery was that made by Galvani,\r\nProfessor of Anatomy at Bologna. In 1790, electricity, as an\r\nexperimental science, was nearly stationary. The impulse given to\r\nits progress by the splendid phenomena of the Leyden phial had\r\nalmost died away; Coulomb was employed in systematizing the theory\r\nof the electric fluid, as shown by its statical effects; but in all\r\nthe other parts of the subject, no great principle or new result had\r\nfor some time been detected. The first announcement of Galvani's\r\ndiscovery in 1791 excited great notice, for it was given forth as a\r\nmanifestation of electricity under a new and remarkable character;\r\nnamely, as residing in the muscles of animals.[1\\13] The limbs of a\r\ndissected frog were observed to move, when touched with pieces of\r\ntwo different metals; the agent which produced these motions was\r\nconceived to be identified with electricity, and was termed _animal\r\nelectricity_; and Galvani's experiments were repeated, with various\r\nmodifications, in all parts of Europe, exciting much curiosity, and\r\ngiving rise to many speculations.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\13: _De Viribus Electricis in Motu Musculari_, Comm. Bonon.\r\nt. vii. 1792.]\r\n\r\nIt is our business to determine the character of each great\r\ndiscovery which appears in the progress of science. Men are fond of\r\nrepeating that such discoveries are most commonly the result of\r\naccident; and we have seen reason to reject this opinion, since that\r\npreparation of thought by which the accident produces discovery is\r\nthe most important of the conditions on which the successful event\r\ndepends. Such accidents are like a spark which discharges a gun\r\nalready loaded and pointed. In the case of Galvani, indeed, the\r\ndiscovery may, with more propriety than usual, be said to have been\r\ncasual; but in the form in which it was first noted, it exhibited no\r\nimportant novelty. His frog was lying on a table near the conductor\r\nof an electrical machine, and the convulsions appeared only when a\r\nspark was taken from the machine. If Galvani had been as good a\r\nphysicist as he was an anatomist, he would probably have seen that\r\nthe movements so occasioned proved only that the muscles or nerves,\r\nor the two together, formed a very sensitive indicator of electrical\r\naction. It was when he produced such motions by contact of metals\r\nalone, that he obtained an important and fundamental fact in science.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this fact into its real and essential conditions was\r\nthe work of Alexander Volta, another Italian professor. Volta,\r\nindeed, possessed that knowledge of the subject of electricity which\r\nmade a hint like that of Galvani the basis of a new science. Galvani\r\nappears {239} never to have acquired much general knowledge of\r\nelectricity: Volta, on the other hand, had labored at this branch of\r\nknowledge from the age of eighteen, through a period of nearly\r\nthirty years; and had invented an _electrophorus_ and an _electrical\r\ncondenser_, which showed great experimental skill. When he turned\r\nhis attention to the experiments made by Galvani, he observed that\r\nthe author of them had been far more surprised than he needed to be,\r\nat those results in which an electrical spark was produced; and that\r\nit was only in the cases in which no such apparatus was employed,\r\nthat the observations could justly be considered as indicating a new\r\nlaw, or a new kind of electricity.[2\\13] He soon satisfied\r\nhimself[3\\13] (about 1794) that the essential conditions of this\r\nkind of action depended on the metals; that it is brought into play\r\nmost decidedly when two different metals touch each other, and are\r\nconnected by any moist body;--and that the parts of animals which\r\nhad been used discharged the office both of such moist bodies, and\r\nof very sensitive electrometers. The _animal_ electricity of Galvani\r\nmight, he observed, be with more propriety called _metallic_\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\13: _Phil. Trans._ 1793, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\13: See Fischer, viii. 625.]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of this agency as a peculiar kind of _electricity_,\r\narose in part perhaps, at first, from the confusion made by Galvani\r\nbetween the cases in which his electrical machine was, and those in\r\nwhich it was not employed. But the identity was confirmed by its\r\nbeing found that the known difference of electrical conductors and\r\nnon-conductors regulated the conduction of the new influence. The\r\nmore exact determination of the new facts to those of electricity\r\nwas a succeeding step of the progress of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe term \"animal electricity\" has been superseded by others, of\r\nwhich _galvanism_ is perhaps the most familiar. I think it will\r\nappear from what has been said, that Volta's office in this\r\ndiscovery is of a much higher and more philosophical kind than that\r\nof Galvani; and it would, on this account, be more fitting to employ\r\nthe term _voltaic electricity_; which, indeed, is very commonly\r\nused, especially by our most recent and comprehensive writers.\r\n\r\nVolta more fully still established his claim as the main originator\r\nof this science by his next step. When some of those who repeated\r\nthe experiments of Galvani had expressed a wish that there was some\r\nmethod of multiplying the effect of _this_ electricity, such as the\r\nLeyden phial supplies for common electricity, they probably thought\r\ntheir wishes far from a realization. But the _voltaic pile_, which\r\nVolta {240} described in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1800,\r\ncompletely satisfies this aspiration; and was, in fact, a more\r\nimportant step in the history of electricity than the Leyden jar had\r\nbeen. It has since undergone various modifications, of which the\r\nmost important was that introduced by **Cruickshanks, who[4\\13]\r\nsubstituted a trough for a pile. But in all cases the principle of\r\nthe instrument was the same;--a continued repetition of the triple\r\ncombination of two metals and a fluid in contact, so as to form a\r\ncircuit which returns into itself.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\13: Fischer, viii. p. 683.]\r\n\r\nSuch an instrument is capable of causing effects of great intensity;\r\nas seen both in the production of light and heat, and in chemical\r\nchanges. But the discovery with which we are here concerned, is not\r\nthe details and consequences of the effects, (which belong to\r\nchemistry,) but the analysis of the conditions under which such\r\neffects take place; and this we may consider as completed by Volta\r\nat the epoch of which we speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AND CONFIRMATION OF THE DISCOVERY OF VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALVANI'S experiments excited a great interest all over Europe, in\r\nconsequence partly of a circumstance which, as we have seen, was\r\nunessential, the muscular contractions and various sensations which\r\nthey occasioned. Galvani himself had not only considered the animal\r\nelement of the circuit as the origin of the electricity, but had\r\nframed a theory,[5\\13] in which he compared the muscles to charged\r\njars, and the nerves to the discharging wires; and a controversy\r\nwas, for some time, carried on, in Italy, between the adherents of\r\nGalvani and those of Volta.[6\\13]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\13: Ib. viii. 613.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\13: Ib. viii. 619.]\r\n\r\nThe galvanic experiments, and especially those which appeared to\r\nhave a physiological bearing, were verified and extended by a number\r\nof the most active philosophers of Europe, and especially William\r\nvon Humboldt. A commission of the Institute of France, appointed in\r\n1797, repeated many of the known experiments, but does not seem to\r\nhave decided any disputed points. The researches of this {241}\r\ncommission referred rather to the discoveries of Galvani than to\r\nthose of Volta: the latter were, indeed, hardly known in France till\r\nthe conquest of Italy by Bonaparte, in 1801. France was, at the\r\nperiod of these discoveries, separated from all other countries by\r\nwar, and especially from England,[7\\13] where Volta's Memoirs were\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\13: _Biog. Univ._, art. _Volta_, (by Biot.)]\r\n\r\nThe political revolutions of Italy affected, in very different\r\nmanners, the two discoverers of whom we speak. Galvani refused to\r\ntake an oath of allegiance to the Cisalpine republic, which the\r\nFrench conqueror established; he was consequently stripped of all\r\nhis offices; and deprived, by the calamities of the times, of most\r\nof his relations, he sank into poverty, melancholy, and debility. At\r\nlast his scientific reputation induced the republican rulers to\r\ndecree his restoration to his professorial chair; but his claims\r\nwere recognised too late, and he died without profiting by this\r\nintended favor, in 1798.\r\n\r\nVolta, on the other hand, was called to Paris by Bonaparte as a man\r\nof science, and invested with honors, emoluments, and titles. The\r\nconqueror himself, indeed, was strongly interested by this train of\r\nresearch.[8\\13] He himself founded valuable prizes, expressly with a\r\nview to promote its prosecution. At this period, there was something\r\nin this subject peculiarly attractive to his Italian mind; for the\r\nfirst glimpses of discoveries of great promise have always excited\r\nan enthusiastic activity of speculation in the philosophers of\r\nItaly, though generally accompanied with a want of precise thought.\r\nIt is narrated[9\\13] of Bonaparte, that after seeing the\r\ndecomposition of the salts by means of the voltaic pile, he turned\r\nto Corvisart, his physician, and said, \"Here, doctor, is the image\r\nof life; the vertebral column is the pile, the liver is the\r\nnegative, the bladder the positive, pole.\" The importance of voltaic\r\nresearches is not less than it was estimated by Bonaparte; but the\r\nresults to which it was to lead were of a kind altogether different\r\nfrom those which thus suggested themselves to his mind. The\r\nconnexion of mechanical and chemical action was the first great\r\npoint to be dealt with; and for this purpose the laws of the\r\nmechanical action of voltaic electricity were to be studied.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\13: Becquerel, _Traité d'Electr._ t. i. p. 107.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\13: Ib. t. i. p. 108.]\r\n\r\nIt will readily be supposed that the voltaic researches, thus begun,\r\nopened a number of interesting topics of examination and discussion.\r\nThese, however, it does not belong to our place to dwell upon at\r\npresent; since they formed parts of the theory of the subject, which\r\n{242} was not completed till light had been thrown upon it from\r\nother quarters. The identity of galvanism with electricity, for\r\ninstance, was at first, as we have intimated, rather conjectured\r\nthan proved. It was denied by Dr. Fowler, in 1793; was supposed to\r\nbe confirmed by Dr. Wells two years later; but was, still later,\r\nquestioned by Davy. The nature of the operation of the pile was\r\nvariously conceived. Volta himself had obtained a view of it which\r\nsucceeding researches confirmed, when he asserted,[10\\13] in 1800,\r\nthat it resembled an electric battery feebly charged and constantly\r\nrenewing its charge. In pursuance of this view, the common\r\nelectrical action was, at a later period (for instance by Ampère, in\r\n1820), called _electrical tension_, while the voltaic action was\r\ncalled the _electrical current_, or _electromotive action_. The\r\ndifferent effects produced, by increasing the size and the number of\r\nthe plates in the voltaic trough, were also very remarkable. The\r\npower of producing heat was found to depend on the size of the\r\nplates; the power of producing chemical changes, on the other hand,\r\nwas augmented by the number of plates of which the battery\r\nconsisted. The former effect was referred to the increased\r\n_quantity_, the latter to the _intensity_, of the electric fluid. We\r\nmention these distinctions at present, rather for the purpose of\r\nexplaining the language in which the results of the succeeding\r\ninvestigations are narrated, than with the intention of representing\r\nthe hypotheses and measures which they imply, as clearly\r\nestablished, at the period of which we speak. For that purpose new\r\ndiscoveries were requisite, which we have soon to relate.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\13: _Phil. Trans._ p. 403.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF THE MUTUAL ATTRACTION AND REPULSION OF\r\nVOLTAIC CURRENTS.--AMPÈRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN order to show the place of voltaic electricity among the\r\nmechanico-chemical sciences, we must speak of its mechanical laws as\r\nseparate from the laws of electro-magnetic action; although, in\r\nfact, it was only in consequence of the forces which conducting\r\nvoltaic wires exert upon magnets, that those forces were detected\r\nwhich they exert upon each {243} other. This latter discovery was\r\nmade by M. Ampère; and the extraordinary rapidity and sagacity with\r\nwhich he caught the suggestion of such forces, from the\r\nelectro-magnetic experiments of M. Oersted, (of which we shall speak\r\nin the next chapter,) well entitle him to be considered as a great\r\nand independent discoverer. As he truly says,[11\\13] \"it by no means\r\nfollowed, that because a conducting wire exerted a force on a\r\nmagnet, two conducting wires must exert a force on each other; for\r\ntwo pieces of soft iron, both of which affect a magnet, do not\r\naffect each other.\" But immediately on the promulgation of Oersted's\r\nexperiments, in 1820, Ampère leapt forwards to a general theory of\r\nthe facts, of which theory the mutual attraction and repulsion of\r\nconducting voltaic wires was a fundamental supposition. The\r\nsupposition was immediately verified by direct trial; and the laws\r\nof this attraction and repulsion were soon determined, with great\r\nexperimental ingenuity, and a very remarkable command of the\r\nresources of analysis. But the experimental and analytical\r\ninvestigation of the mutual action of voltaic or electrical\r\ncurrents, was so mixed up with the examination of the laws of\r\nelectro-magnetism, which had given occasion to the investigation,\r\nthat we must not treat the two provinces of research as separate.\r\nThe mention in this place, premature as it might appear, of the\r\nlabors of Ampère, arises inevitably from his being the author of a\r\nbeautiful and comprehensive generalization, which not only included\r\nthe phenomena exhibited by the new combinations of Oersted, but also\r\ndisclosed forces which existed in arrangements already familiar,\r\nalthough they had never been detected till the theory pointed out\r\nhow they were to be looked for.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\13: _Théorie des Phénom. Electrodynamiques_, p. 113.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ACTION.--OERSTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE impulse which the discovery of galvanism, in 1791, and that of\r\nthe voltaic pile, in 1800, had given to the study of electricity as\r\na mechanical science, had nearly died away in 1820. It was in that\r\nyear that M. Oersted, of Copenhagen, announced that the conducting\r\n{244} wire of a voltaic circuit, acts upon a magnetic needle; and\r\nthus recalled into activity that endeavor to connect magnetism with\r\nelectricity, which, though apparently on many accounts so hopeful,\r\nhad hitherto been attended with no success. Oersted found that the\r\nneedle has a tendency to place itself _at right angles_ to the\r\nwire;--a kind of action altogether different from any which had been\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nThis observation was of vast importance; and the analysis of its\r\nconditions and consequences employed the best philosophers in Europe\r\nimmediately on its promulgation. It is impossible, without great\r\ninjustice, to refuse great merit to Oersted as the author of the\r\ndiscovery. We have already said that men appear generally inclined\r\nto believe remarkable discoveries to be accidental, and the\r\ndiscovery of Oersted has been spoken of as a casual insulated\r\nexperiment.[12\\13] Yet Oersted had been looking for such an\r\n_accident_ probably more carefully and perseveringly than any other\r\nperson in Europe. In 1807, he had published[13\\13] a work, in which\r\nhe professed that his purpose was \"to ascertain whether electricity,\r\nin its most latent state, had any effect on the magnet.\" And he, as\r\nI know from his own declaration, considered his discovery as the\r\nnatural sequel and confirmation of his early researches; as, indeed,\r\nit fell in readily and immediately with speculations on these\r\nsubjects then very prevalent in Germany. It was an accident like\r\nthat by which a man guesses a riddle on which his mind has long been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\13: See _Schelling ueber Faraday's Entdeckung_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\13: Ampère, p. 69.]\r\n\r\nBesides the confirmation of Oersted's observations by many\r\nexperimenters, great additions were made to his facts: of these, one\r\nof the most important was due to Ampère. Since the earth is in fact\r\nmagnetic, the voltaic wire ought to be affected by terrestrial\r\nmagnetism alone, and ought to tend to assume a position depending on\r\nthe position of the compass-needle. At first, the attempts to\r\nproduce this effect failed, but soon, with a more delicate\r\napparatus, the result was found to agree with the anticipation.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to dwell on any of the subsequent researches,\r\nexcept so far as they are essential to our great object, the progress\r\ntowards a general theory of the subject. I proceed, therefore,\r\nimmediately to the attempts made towards this object. {245}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nON attempting to analyse the electro-magnetic phenomena observed by\r\nOersted and others into their simplest forms, they appeared, at\r\nleast at first sight, to be different from any mechanical actions\r\nwhich had yet been observed. It seemed as if the conducting wire\r\nexerted on the pole of the magnet a force which was not attractive\r\nor repulsive, but _transverse_;--not tending to draw the point acted\r\non nearer, or to push it further off, in the line which reached from\r\nthe acting point, but urging it to move at right angles to this\r\nline. The forces appeared to be such as Kepler had dreamt of in the\r\ninfancy of mechanical conceptions; rather than such as those of\r\nwhich Newton had established the existence in the solar system, and\r\nsuch as he, and all his successors, had supposed to be the only\r\nkinds of force which exist in nature. The north pole of the needle\r\nmoved as if it were impelled by a vortex revolving round the wire in\r\none direction, while the south pole seemed to be driven by an\r\nopposite vortex. The case seemed novel, and almost paradoxical.\r\n\r\nIt was soon established by experiments, made in a great variety of\r\nforms, that the mechanical action was really of this transverse\r\nkind. And a curious result was obtained, which a little while before\r\nwould have been considered as altogether incredible;--that this\r\nforce would cause a constant and rapid revolution of either of the\r\nbodies about the other;--of the conducting wire about the magnet, or\r\nof the magnet about the conducting wire. This was effected by Mr.\r\nFaraday in 1821.\r\n\r\nThe laws which regulated the intensity of this force, with reference\r\nto the distance and position of the bodies, now naturally came to be\r\nexamined. MM. Biot and Savart in France, and Mr. Barlow in England,\r\ninstituted such measures; and satisfied themselves that the\r\nelementary force followed the law of magnitude of all known\r\nelementary forces, in being inversely as the square of the distance;\r\nalthough, in its direction, it was so entirely different from other\r\nforces. But the investigation of the _laws of phenomena_ of the\r\nsubject was too closely connected with the choice of a mechanical\r\ntheory, to be established {246} previously and independently, as had\r\nbeen done in astronomy. The experiments gave complex results, and\r\nthe analysis of these into their elementary actions was almost an\r\nindispensable step in order to disentangle their laws. We must,\r\ntherefore, state the progress of this analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF ELECTRODYNAMICAL ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPÈRE'S THEORY.--Nothing can show in a more striking manner the\r\nadvanced condition of physical speculation in 1820, than the\r\nreduction of the strange and complex phenomena of electromagnetism\r\nto a simple and general theory as soon as they were published.\r\nInstead of a gradual establishment of laws of phenomena, and of\r\ntheories more and more perfect, occupying ages, as in the case of\r\nastronomy, or generations, as in the instances of magnetism and\r\nelectricity, a few months sufficed for the whole process of\r\ngeneralization; and the experiments made at Copenhagen were\r\nannounced at Paris and London, almost at the same time with the\r\nskilful analysis and comprehensive inductions of Ampère.\r\n\r\nYet we should err if we should suppose, from the celerity with which\r\nthe task was executed, that it was an easy one. There were required\r\nin the author of such a theory, not only those clear conceptions of\r\nthe relations of space and force, which are the first conditions of\r\nall sound theory, and a full possession of the experiments; but also\r\na masterly command of the mathematical arms by which alone the\r\nvictory could be gained, and a sagacious selection of proper\r\nexperiments which might decide the fate of the proposed hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the nature of the requisite hypothesis was not\r\ndifficult to see in a certain vague and limited way. The\r\nconducting-wire and the magnetic needle had a tendency to arrange\r\nthemselves at right angles to one another. This might be represented\r\nby supposing the wire to be made up of transverse magnetic needles,\r\nor by supposing the needle to be made up of transverse\r\nconducting-wires; for it was easy to conceive forces which should\r\nbring corresponding elements, either magnetic or voltaic, into\r\nparallel positions; and then the {247} general phenomena above\r\nstated would be accounted for. And the choice between the two modes\r\nof conception, appeared at first sight a matter of indifference. The\r\nmajority of philosophers at first adopted, or at least employed, the\r\nformer method, as Oersted in Germany, Berzelius in Sweden, Wollaston\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nAmpère adopted the other view, according to which the magnet is made\r\nup of conducting-wires in a transverse position. But he did for his\r\nhypothesis what no one did or could do for the other: he showed that\r\nit was the only one which would account, without additional and\r\narbitrary suppositions, for the facts of _continued_ motion in\r\nelectromagnetic cases. And he further elevated his theory to a\r\nhigher rank of generality, by showing that it explained,--not only\r\nthe action of a conducting-wire upon a magnet, but also two other\r\nclasses of facts, already spoken of in this history,--the action of\r\nmagnets upon each other,--and the action of conducting-wires upon\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe deduction of such particular cases from the theory, required, as\r\nmay easily be imagined, some complex calculations: but the deduction\r\nbeing satisfactory, it will be seen that Ampère's theory conformed\r\nto that description which we have repeatedly had to point out as the\r\nusual character of a true and stable theory; namely, that besides\r\naccounting for the class of phenomena which suggested it, it\r\nsupplies an unforeseen explanation of other known facts. For the\r\nmutual action of magnets, which was supposed to be already reduced\r\nto a satisfactory theoretical form by Coulomb, was not contemplated\r\nby Ampère in the formation of his hypothesis; and the mutual action\r\nof voltaic currents, though tried only in consequence of the\r\nsuggestion of the theory, was clearly a fact distinct from\r\nelectromagnetic action; yet all these facts flowed alike from the\r\ntheory. And thus Ampère brought into view a class of forces for\r\nwhich the term \"electromagnetic\" was too limited, and which he\r\ndesignated[14\\13] by the appropriate term _electrodynamic_;\r\ndistinguishing them by this expression, as the forces of an electric\r\n_current_, from the _statical_ effects of electricity which we had\r\nformerly to treat of. This term has passed into common use among\r\nscientific writers, and remains the record and stamp of the success\r\nof the Amperian induction.\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\13: _Ann. de Chim._, tom. xx. p. 60 (1822).]\r\n\r\nThe first promulgation of Ampère's views was by a communication to\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences, September the 18th, 1820; Oersted's\r\ndiscoveries having reached Paris only in the preceding July. {248}\r\nAt almost every meeting of the Academy during the remainder of that\r\nyear and the beginning of the following one, he had new\r\ndevelopements or new confirmations of his theory to announce. The\r\nmost hypothetical part of his theory,--the proposition that magnets\r\nmight be considered in their effects as identical with spiral\r\nvoltaic wires,--he asserted from the very first. The mutual\r\nattraction and repulsion of voltaic wires,--the laws of this\r\naction,--the deduction of the observed facts from it by\r\ncalculation,--the determination, by new experiments, of the constant\r\nquantities which entered into his formulæ,--followed in rapid\r\nsuccession. The theory must be briefly stated. It had already been\r\nseen that parallel voltaic currents attracted each other; when,\r\ninstead of being parallel, they were situate in any directions, they\r\nstill exerted attractive and repulsive forces depending on the\r\ndistance, and on the directions of each element of both currents.\r\nAdd to this doctrine the hypothetical constitution of magnets,\r\nnamely, that a voltaic current runs round the axis of each particle,\r\nand we have the means of calculating a vast variety of results which\r\nmay be compared with experiment. But the laws of the elementary\r\nforces required further fixation. What _functions_ are the forces of\r\nthe distance and the directions of the elements?\r\n\r\nTo extract from experiment an answer to this inquiry was far from\r\neasy, for the elementary forces were mathematically connected with\r\nthe observed facts, by a double mathematical integration;--a long,\r\nand, while the constant coefficients remained undefined, hardly a\r\npossible operation. Ampère made some trials in this way, but his\r\nhappier genius suggested to him a better path. It occurred to him,\r\nthat if his integrals, without being specially found, could be shown\r\nto vanish upon the whole, under certain conditions of the problem,\r\nthis circumstance would correspond to arrangements of his apparatus\r\nin which a state of equilibrium was preserved, however the form of\r\nsome of the parts might be changed. He found two such cases, which\r\nwere of great importance to the theory. The first of these cases\r\nproved that the force exerted by any element of the voltaic wire\r\nmight be resolved into other forces by a theorem resembling the\r\nwell-known proposition of the parallelogram of forces. This was\r\nproved by showing that the action of a straight wire is the same\r\nwith that of another wire which joins the same extremities, but is\r\nbent and contorted in any way whatever. But it still remained\r\nnecessary to determine two fundamental quantities; one which\r\nexpressed the _power_ of the distance according to which the force\r\nvaried; the other, the {249} degree in which the force is affected\r\nby the _obliquity_ of the elements. One of the general causes of\r\nequilibrium, of which we have spoken, gave a relation between these\r\ntwo quantities;[15\\13] and as the power was naturally, and, as it\r\nafterwards appeared, rightly conjectured to be the inverse square,\r\nthe other quantity also was determined; and the general problem of\r\nelectrodynamical action was fully solved.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\13: Communication to the Acad. Sc., June 10, 1822. See\r\nAmpère, _Recueil_, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nIf Ampère had not been an accomplished analyst, he would not have\r\nbeen able to discover the condition on which the nullity of the\r\nintegral in this case depended.[16\\13] And throughout his labors, we\r\nfind reason to admire, both his mathematical skill, and his\r\nsteadiness of thought; although these excellences are by no means\r\naccompanied throughout with corresponding clearness and elegance of\r\nexposition in his writings.\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\13: _Recueil_, p. 314.]\r\n\r\n_Reception of Ampère's Theory._--Clear mathematical conceptions, and\r\nsome familiarity with mathematical operations, were needed by\r\nreaders also, in order to appreciate the evidence of the theory;\r\nand, therefore, we need not feel any surprise if it was, on its\r\npublication and establishment, hailed with far less enthusiasm than\r\nso remarkable a triumph of generalizing power might appear to\r\ndeserve. For some time, indeed, the greater portion of the public\r\nwere naturally held in suspense by the opposing weight of rival\r\nnames. The Amperian theory did not make its way without contention\r\nand competition. The electro-magnetic experiments, from their first\r\nappearance, gave a clear promise of some new and wide\r\ngeneralization; and held out a prize of honor and fame to him who\r\nshould be first in giving the right interpretation of the riddle. In\r\nFrance, the emulation for such reputation is perhaps more vigilant\r\nand anxious than it is elsewhere; and we see, on this as on other\r\noccasions, the scientific host of Paris springing upon a new subject\r\nwith an impetuosity which, in a short time, runs into controversies\r\nfor priority or for victory. In this case, M. Biot, as well as\r\nAmpère, endeavored to reduce the electro-magnetic phenomena to\r\ngeneral laws. The discussion between him and Ampère turned on some\r\npoints which are curious. M. Biot was disposed to consider as an\r\nelementary action, the force which an element of a voltaic wire\r\nexerts upon a magnetic particle, and which is, as we have seen, at\r\nright angles to their mutual distance; and he conceived that {250}\r\nthe equal reaction which necessarily accompanies this action acts\r\noppositely to the action, not in the same line, but in a parallel\r\nline, at the other extremity of the distance; thus forming a\r\nprimitive _couple_, to use a technical expression borrowed from\r\nmechanics. To this Ampère objected,[17\\13] that the _direct_\r\nopposition of all elementary action and reaction was a universal and\r\nnecessary mechanical law. He showed too that such a couple as had\r\nbeen assumed, would follow as a _derivative_ result from his theory.\r\nAnd in comparing his own theory with that in which the voltaic wire\r\nis assimilated to a collection of transverse magnets, he was also\r\nable to prove that no such assemblage of forces acting to and from\r\nfixed points, as the forces of magnets do act, could produce a\r\ncontinued motion like that discovered by Faraday. This, indeed, was\r\nonly the well-known demonstration of the impossibility of a\r\nperpetual motion. If, instead of a collection of magnets, the\r\nadverse theorists had spoken of a magnetic _current_, they might\r\nprobably interpret their expressions so as to explain the facts;\r\nthat is, if they considered every element of such a current as a\r\nmagnet, and consequently, every point of it as being a north and a\r\nsouth point at the same instant. But to introduce such a conception\r\nof a magnetic current was to abandon all the laws of magnetic action\r\nhitherto established; and consequently to lose all that gave the\r\nhypothesis its value. The idea of an electric current, on the other\r\nhand, was so far from being a new and hazardous assumption, that it\r\nhad already been forced upon philosophers from the time of Volta;\r\nand in this current, the relation of _preceding_ and _succeeding_,\r\nwhich necessarily existed between the extremities of any element,\r\nintroduced that relative polarity on which the success of the\r\nexplanations of the facts depended. And thus in this controversy,\r\nthe theory of Ampère has a great and undeniable superiority over the\r\nrival hypotheses.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\13: Ampère, _Théorie_, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE ELECTRODYNAMIC THEORY.\r\n\r\nIT is not necessary to state the various applications which were\r\nsoon made of the electro-magnetic discoveries. But we may notice one\r\n{251} of the most important,--the _Galvanometer_, an instrument\r\nwhich, by enabling the philosopher to detect and to measure\r\nextremely minute electrodynamic actions, gave an impulse to the\r\nsubject similar to that which it received from the invention of the\r\nLeyden Phial, or the Voltaic Pile. The strength of the voltaic\r\ncurrent was measured, in this instrument, by the deflection produced\r\nin a compass-needle; and its sensibility was multiplied by making\r\nthe wire pass repeatedly above and below the needle. Schweigger, of\r\nHalle, was one of the first devisers of this apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of electro-magnets, that is, of spiral tubes\r\ncomposed of voltaic wires, for common magnets, gave rise to a\r\nvariety of curious apparatus and speculations, some of which I shall\r\nhereafter mention.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [When a voltaic apparatus is in action, there may be\r\nconceived to be a current of electricity running through its various\r\nelements, as stated in the text. The force of this current in\r\nvarious parts of the circuit has been made the subject of\r\nmathematical investigation by M. Ohm.[18\\13] The problem is in every\r\nrespect similar to that of the flow of heat through a body, and\r\ntaken generally, leads to complex calculations of the same kind. But\r\nDr. Ohm, by limiting the problem in the first place by conditions\r\nwhich the usual nature and form of voltaic apparatus suggest, has\r\nbeen able to give great simplicity to his reasonings. These\r\nconditions are, the linear form of the conductors (wires) and the\r\nsteadiness of the electric state. For this part of the problem Dr.\r\nOhm's reasonings are as simple and as demonstrative as the\r\nelementary propositions of Mechanics. The formulæ for the electric\r\nforce of a voltaic current to which he is led have been\r\nexperimentally verified by others, especially Fechner,[19\\13]\r\nGauss,[20\\13] Lenz, Jacobi, Poggendorf, and Pouillet.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\13: _Die Galvanische Kette Mathematisch bearbeitet von Dr.\r\nG. S. Ohm_, Berlin, 1827.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\13: _**Mass-bestimmungen über die Galvanische Kette._\r\nLeipzig, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\13: _Results of the Magnetic Association._]\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves, Mr. Wheatstone has confirmed and applied the views\r\nof M. Ohm, in a Memoir[21\\13] _On New Instruments and Processes for\r\ndetermining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit_. He there remarks\r\nthat the clear ideas of electromotive forces and resistances,\r\nsubstituted by Ohm for the vague notions of quantity and intensity\r\nwhich have long been prevalent, give satisfactory explanations of\r\nthe most important difficulties, and express the laws of a vast\r\nnumber of phenomena {252} in formulæ of remarkable simplicity and\r\ngenerality. In this Memoir, Professor Wheatstone describes an\r\ninstrument which he terms _Rheostat_, because it brings to a common\r\nstandard the voltaic currents which are compared by it. He\r\ngeneralizes the language of the subject by employing the term\r\n_rheomotor_ for any apparatus which originates an electric current\r\n(whether voltaic or thermoelectric, &c.) and _rheometer_ for any\r\ninstrument to measure the force of such a current. It appears that\r\nthe idea of constructing an instrument of the nature of the Rheostat\r\nhad occurred also to Prof. Jacobi, of St Petersburg.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\13: _Phil. Trans._ 1843. Pt. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe galvanometer led to the discovery of another class of cases in\r\nwhich the electrodynamical action was called into play, namely,\r\nthose in which a circuit, composed of two metals only, became\r\nelectro-magnetic by _heating_ one part of it. This discovery of\r\n_thermo-electricity_ was made by Professor Seebeck of Berlin, in\r\n1822, and prosecuted by various persons; especially by Prof.\r\nCumming[22\\13] of Cambridge, who, early in 1823, extended the\r\nexamination of this property to most of the metals, and determined\r\ntheir thermo-electric order. But as these investigations exhibited\r\nno new mechanical effects of electromotive forces, they do not now\r\nfurther concern us; and we pass on, at present, to a case in which\r\nsuch forces act in a manner different from any of those already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\13: _Camb. Trans._ vol. ii. p. 62. _On the Development of\r\nElectro-Magnetism by Heat._]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF DIAMAGNETISM.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [By the discoveries just related, a cylindrical spiral of\r\nwire through which an electric current is passing is identified with\r\na magnet; and the effect of such a spiral is increased by placing in\r\nit a core of soft iron. By the use of such a combination under the\r\ninfluence of a voltaic battery, magnets are constructed far more\r\npowerful than those which depend upon the permanent magnetism of\r\niron. The electro-magnet employed by Dr. Faraday in some of his\r\nexperiments would sustain a hundred-weight at either end.\r\n\r\nBy the use of such magnets Dr. Faraday discovered that, besides\r\niron, nickel and cobalt, which possess magnetism in a high degree,\r\nmany bodies are magnetic in a slight degree. And he made the further\r\nvery important discovery, that of those substances which are not\r\nmagnetic, many, perhaps all, possess an opposite property, in virtue\r\nof which he terms them _diamagnetic_. The opposition is of this\r\n{253} kind;--that magnetic bodies in the form of bars or needles,\r\nif free to move, arrange themselves in the _axial_ line joining the\r\npoles; diamagnetic bodies under the same circumstances arrange\r\nthemselves in an _equatorial_ position, perpendicular to the axial\r\nline. And this tendency he conceives to be the result of one more\r\ngeneral; that whereas magnetic bodies are attracted to the poles of\r\na magnet, diamagnetic bodies are repelled from the poles. The list\r\nof diamagnetic bodies includes all kinds of substances; not only\r\nmetals, as antimony, bismuth, gold, silver, lead, tin, zinc, but\r\nmany crystals, glass, phosphorus, sulphur, sugar, gum, wood, ivory;\r\nand even flesh and fruit.\r\n\r\nIt appears that M. le Bailli had shown, in 1829, that both bismuth\r\nand antimony and bismuth repelled the magnetic needle; and as Dr.\r\nFaraday remarks, it is astonishing that such an experiment should\r\nhave remained so long without further results. M. Becquerel in 1827\r\nobserved, and quoted Coulomb as having also observed, that a needle\r\nof wood under certain conditions pointed across the magnetic curves;\r\nand also stated that he had found a needle of wood place itself\r\nparallel to the wires of a galvanometer. This he referred to a\r\nmagnetism transverse to the length. But he does not refer the\r\nphenomena to elementary repulsive action, nor show that they are\r\ncommon to an immense class of bodies, nor distinguish this\r\ndiamagnetic from the magnetic class, as Faraday has taught us to do.\r\n\r\nI do not dwell upon the peculiar phenomena of copper which, in the\r\nsame series of researches, are traced by Dr. Faraday to the combined\r\neffect of its diamagnetic character, and the electric currents\r\nexcited in it by the electro-magnet; nor to the optical phenomena\r\nmanifested by certain transparent diamagnetic substances under\r\nelectric action; as already stated in Book ix.[23\\13]]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\13: See the _Twentieth Series of Experimental Researches in\r\nElectricity_, read to the Royal Society, Dec. 18, 1845.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF MAGNETO-ELECTRIC INDUCTION.--FARADAY.\r\n\r\nIT was clearly established by Ampère, as we have seen, that magnetic\r\naction is a peculiar form of electromotive actions, and that, in\r\n{254} this kind of agency, action and reaction are equal and\r\nopposite. It appeared to follow almost irresistibly from these\r\nconsiderations, that magnetism might be made to produce electricity,\r\nas electricity could be made to imitate all the effects of\r\nmagnetism. Yet for a long time the attempts to obtain such a result\r\nwere fruitless. Faraday, in 1825, endeavored to make the\r\nconducting-wire of the voltaic circuit excite electricity in a\r\nneighboring wire by induction, as the conductor charged with common\r\nelectricity would have done, but he obtained no such effect. If this\r\nattempt had succeeded, the magnet, which, for all such purposes, is\r\nan assemblage of voltaic circuits, might also have been made to\r\nexcite electricity. About the same time, an experiment was made in\r\nFrance by M. Arago, which really involved the effect thus sought;\r\nthough this effect was not extricated from the complex phenomenon,\r\ntill Faraday began his splendid career of discovery on this subject\r\nin 1832. Arago's observation was, that the rapid revolution of a\r\nconducting-plate in the neighborhood of a magnet, gave rise to a\r\nforce acting on the magnet. In England, Messrs. Barlow and Christie,\r\nHerschel and Babbage, repeated and tried to analyse this experiment;\r\nbut referring the forces only to conditions of space and time, and\r\noverlooking the real cause, the electrical currents produced by the\r\nmotion, these philosophers were altogether unsuccessful in their\r\nlabors. In 1831, Faraday again sought for electro-dynamical\r\ninduction, and after some futile trials, at last found it in a form\r\ndifferent from that in which he had looked for it. It was then seen,\r\nthat at the precise time of making or breaking the contact which\r\nclosed the galvanic circuit, a momentary effect was induced in a\r\nneighboring wire, but disappeared instantly.[24\\13] Once in\r\npossession of this fact, Mr. Faraday ran rapidly up the ladder of\r\ndiscovery, to the general point of view.--Instead of suddenly making\r\nor breaking the contact of the inducing circuit, a similar effect\r\nwas produced by removing the inducible wire nearer to or further\r\nfrom the circuit;[25\\13]--the effects were increased by the\r\nproximity of soft iron;[26\\13]--when the soft iron was affected by\r\nan ordinary magnet instead of the voltaic wire, the same effect\r\nstill recurred;[27\\13]--and thus it appeared, that by making and\r\nbreaking magnetic contact, a momentary electric current was\r\nproduced. It was produced also by moving the magnet;[28\\13]--or by\r\nmoving the wire with reference to the magnet.[29\\13] Finally, it was\r\nfound that the earth might supply the place of a magnet {255} in\r\nthis as in other experiments;[30\\13] and the mere motion of a wire,\r\nunder proper circumstances, produced in it, it appeared, a momentary\r\nelectric current.[31\\13] These facts were curiously confirmed by the\r\nresults in special cases. They explained Arago's experiments: for\r\nthe momentary effect became permanent by the revolution of the\r\nplate. And without using the magnet, a revolving plate became an\r\nelectrical machine;[32\\13]--a revolving globe exhibited\r\nelectro-magnetic action,[33\\13] the circuit being complete in the\r\nglobe itself without the addition of any wire;--and a mere motion of\r\nthe wire of a galvanometer produced an electro-dynamic effect upon\r\nits needle.[34\\13]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\13: _Phil. Trans._ 1832, p. 127, First Series, Art. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\13: Art. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\13: Art. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\13: Art. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\13: Art. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\13: Art. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\13: Second Series, _Phil. Trans._ p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\13: Art. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\13: Art. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\13: Art. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\13: Art. 171.]\r\n\r\nBut the question occurs, What is the general law which determines\r\nthe direction of electric currents thus produced by the joint\r\neffects of motion and magnetism? Nothing but a peculiar steadiness\r\nand clearness in his conceptions of space, could have enabled Mr.\r\nFaraday to detect the law of this phenomenon. For the question\r\nrequired that he should determine the mutual relations in space\r\nwhich connect the magnetic poles, the position of the wire, the\r\ndirection of the wire's motion, and the electrical current produced\r\nin it. This was no easy problem; indeed, the mere relation of the\r\nmagnetic to the electric forces, the one set being perpendicular to\r\nthe other, is of itself sufficient to perplex the mind; as we have\r\nseen in the history of the electrodynamical discoveries. But Mr.\r\nFaraday appears to have seized at once the law of the phenomena.\r\n\"The relation,\" he says,[35\\13] \"which holds between the magnetic\r\npole, the moving wire or metal, and the direction of the current\r\nevolved, is very simple (so it seemed to him) although rather\r\ndifficult to express.\" He represents it by referring position and\r\nmotion to the \"magnetic curves,\" which go from a magnetic pole to\r\nthe opposite pole. The current in the wire sets one way or the\r\nother, according to the direction in which the motion of the wire\r\ncuts these curves. And thus he was enabled, at the end of his Second\r\nSeries of _Researches_ (December, 1831), to give, in general terms,\r\nthe law of nature to which may be referred the extraordinary number\r\nof new and curious experiments which he has stated;[36\\13]--namely,\r\nthat if a wire move so as to cut a magnetic curve, a power is called\r\ninto action which tends to urge a magnetic current through the wire;\r\nand that if a mass move so that its parts do not move in the same\r\ndirection across the magnetic curves, {256} and with the same angular\r\nvelocity, electrical currents are called into play in the mass.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\13: First Series, Art. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\13: Art. 256-264.]\r\n\r\nThis rule, thus simple from its generality, though inevitably\r\ncomplex in every special case, may be looked upon as supplying the\r\nfirst demand of philosophy, _the law of the phenomena_; and\r\naccordingly Dr. Faraday has, in all his subsequent researches on\r\nmagneto-electric induction, applied this law to his experiments; and\r\nhas thereby unravelled an immense amount of apparent inconsistency\r\nand confusion, for those who have followed him in his mode of\r\nconceiving the subject.\r\n\r\nBut yet other philosophers have regarded these phenomena in other\r\npoints of view, and have stated the laws of the phenomena in a\r\nmanner different from Faraday's, although for the most part\r\nequivalent to his. And these attempts to express, in the most simple\r\nand general form, the law of the phenomena of magneto-electrical\r\ninduction, have naturally been combined with the expression of other\r\nlaws of electrical and magnetical phenomena. Further, these\r\nendeavors to connect and generalize the Facts have naturally been\r\nclothed in the garb of various Theories:--the _laws of phenomena_\r\nhave been expressed in terms of the supposed _causes of the\r\nphenomena_; as fluids, attractions and repulsions, particles with\r\ncurrents running through them or round them, physical lines of\r\nforce, and the like. Such views, and the conflict of them, are the\r\nnatural and hopeful prognostics of a theory which shall harmonize\r\ntheir discords and include all that each contains of Truth. The\r\nfermentation at present is perhaps too great to allow us to see\r\nclearly the truth which lies at the bottom. But a few of the leading\r\npoints of recent discussions on these subjects will be noticed in\r\nthe Additions to this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTRANSITION TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE preceding train of generalization may justly appear extensive,\r\nand of itself well worthy of admiration. Yet we are to consider all\r\nthat has there been established as only one-half of the science to\r\nwhich it belongs,--one limb of the colossal form of Chemistry. We\r\n{257} have ascertained, we will suppose, the laws of Electric\r\nPolarity; but we have then to ask, What is the relation of this\r\nPolarity to Chemical Composition? This was the great problem which,\r\nconstantly present to the minds of electro-chemical inquirers, drew\r\nthem on, with the promise of some deep and comprehensive insight\r\ninto the mechanism of nature. Long tasks of research, though only\r\nsubsidiary to this, were cheerfully undertaken. Thus Faraday[37\\13]\r\ndescribes himself as compelled to set about satisfying himself of\r\nthe identity of common, animal, and voltaic electricity, as \"the\r\ndecision of a doubtful point which interfered with the extension of\r\nhis views, and destroyed the strictness of reasoning.\" Having\r\nestablished this identity, he proceeded with his grand undertaking\r\nof electro-chemical research.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\13: Dec. 1832. _Researches_, 266.]\r\n\r\nThe connexion of electrical currents with chemical action, though\r\nkept out of sight in the account we have hitherto given, was never\r\nforgotten by the experimenters; for, in fact, the modes in which\r\nelectrical currents were excited, were chemical actions;--the action\r\nof acids and metals on each other in the voltaic trough, or in some\r\nother form. The dependence of the electrical effect on these\r\nchemical actions, and still more, the chemical actions produced by\r\nthe agency of the poles of the circuit, had been carefully studied;\r\nand we must now relate with what success.\r\n\r\nBut in what terms shall we present this narration? We have spoken of\r\nchemical actions,--but what kind of actions are these?\r\n_Decomposition_; the _resolution_ of compounds into their\r\ningredients; the separation of _acids_ from _bases_; the reduction\r\nof bodies to _simple elements_. These names open to us a new drama;\r\nthey are words which belong to a different set of relations of\r\nthings, a different train of scientific inductions, a different\r\nsystem of generalizations, from any with which we have hitherto been\r\nconcerned. We must learn to understand these phrases, before we can\r\nadvance in our history of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd how are we to learn the meaning of this collection of words? In\r\nwhat other language shall it be explained? In what terms shall we\r\ndefine these new expressions? To this we are compelled to reply,\r\nthat we cannot translate these terms into any ordinary\r\nlanguage;--that we cannot define them in any terms already familiar\r\nto us. Here, as in all other branches of knowledge, the meaning of\r\nwords is to be sought in the progress of thought; the history of\r\nscience is our {258} dictionary; the steps of scientific induction\r\nare our definitions. It is only by going back through the successful\r\nresearches of men respecting the composition and elements of bodies,\r\nthat we can learn in what sense such terms must be understood, so as\r\nto convey real knowledge. In order that they may have a meaning for\r\nus, we must inquire what meaning they had in the minds of the\r\nauthors of our discoveries.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we cannot advance a step, till we have brought up our\r\nhistory of Chemistry to the level of our history of\r\nElectricity;--till we have studied the progress of the analytical,\r\nas well as the mechanical sciences. We are compelled to pause and\r\nlook backwards here; just as happened in the history of astronomy,\r\nwhen we arrived at the brink of the great mechanical inductions of\r\nNewton, and found that we must trace the history of Mechanics,\r\nbefore we could proceed to mechanical Astronomy. The terms \"force,\r\nattraction, inertia, momentum,\" sent us back into preceding\r\ncenturies then, just as the terms \"composition\" and \"element\" send\r\nus back now.\r\n\r\nNor is it to a small extent that we have thus to double back upon\r\nour past advance. Next to Astronomy, Chemistry is one of the most\r\nancient of sciences;--the field of the earliest attempts of man to\r\ncommand and understand nature. It has held men for centuries by a\r\nkind of fascination; and innumerable and endless are the various\r\nlabors, the failures and successes, the speculations and\r\nconclusions, the strange pretences and fantastical dreams, of those\r\nwho have pursued it. To exhibit all these, or give any account of\r\nthem, would be impossible; and for our design, it would not be\r\npertinent. To extract from the mass that which is to our purpose, is\r\ndifficult; but the attempt must be made. We must endeavor to analyse\r\nthe history of Chemistry, so far as it has tended towards the\r\nestablishment of general principles. We shall thus obtain a sight of\r\ngeneralizations of a new kind, and shall prepare ourselves for\r\nothers of a higher order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{259}}\r\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\n_THE ANALYTICAL SCIENCE._\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . . . . . .

In medicine, taught as the doctrine of the four\r\n\"elementary qualities,\" of which the human body and all other\r\nsubstances are compounded, it had a very powerful and extensive\r\ninfluence upon medical practice. But this doctrine never led to any\r\nattempt actually to analyse bodies into their supposed elements: for\r\ncomposition was inferred from the resemblance of the qualities, not\r\nfrom the separate exhibition of the ingredients; the supposed\r\nanalysis was, in short, a decomposition of the body into adjectives,\r\nnot into substances.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, therefore, may be considered as a negative state,\r\nantecedent to the very beginning of chemistry; and some progress\r\nbeyond this mere negation was made, as soon as men began to endeavor\r\nto compound and decompound substances by the use of fire or mixture,\r\nhowever erroneous might be the opinions and expectations which they\r\ncombined with their attempts. Alchemy is a step in chemistry, so far\r\nas it implies the recognition of the work of the cupel and the\r\nretort, as the produce of analysis and synthesis. How perplexed and\r\nperverted were the forms in which this recognition was clothed,--how\r\nmixed up with mythical follies and extravagancies, we have already\r\nseen; and the share which Alchemy had in the formation of any\r\nsounder knowledge, is not such as to justify any further notice of\r\nthat pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe result of the attempts to analyse bodies by heat, mixture, and\r\nthe like processes, was the doctrine that the first principles of\r\nthings are _three_, not four; namely, _salt_, _sulphur_, and\r\n_mercury_; and that, of these three, all things are compounded. In\r\nreality, the doctrine, as thus stated, contained no truth which was\r\nof any value; for, though the chemist could extract from most bodies\r\nportions which he called salt, {262} and sulphur, and mercury, these\r\nnames were given, rather to save the hypothesis, than because the\r\nsubstances were really those usually so called: and thus the\r\nsupposed analyses proved nothing, as Boyle justly urged against\r\nthem.[1\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\14: Shaw's Boyle. _Skeptical Chymist_, pp. 312, 313. &c.]\r\n\r\nThe only real advance in chemical theory, therefore, which we can\r\nascribe to the school of _the three principles_, as compared with\r\nthose who held the ancient dogma of the four elements, is, the\r\nacknowledgment of the changes produced by the chemist's operations,\r\nas being changes which were to be accounted for by the union and\r\nseparation of substantial elements, or, as they were sometimes\r\ncalled, of _hypostatical principles_. The workmen of this school\r\nacquired, no doubt, a considerable acquaintance with the results of\r\nthe kinds of processes which they pursued; they applied their\r\nknowledge to the preparation of new medicines; and some of them, as\r\nParacelsus and Van Helmont, attained, in this way, to great fame and\r\ndistinction: but their merits, as regards theoretical chemistry,\r\nconsist only in a truer conception of the problem, and of the mode\r\nof attempting its solution, than their predecessors had entertained.\r\n\r\nThis step is well marked by a word which, about the time of which we\r\nspeak, was introduced to denote the chemist's employment. It was\r\ncalled the _Spagiric art_, (often misspelt _Spagyric_,) from two\r\nGreek words, (σπάω, ἀγείρω,) which mean to _separate_ parts, and to\r\n_unite_ them. These two processes, or in more modern language,\r\n_analysis_ and _synthesis_, constitute the whole business of the\r\nchemist. We are not making a fanciful arrangement, therefore, when\r\nwe mark the recognition of this object as a step in the progress of\r\nchemistry. I now proceed to consider the manner in which the\r\nconditions of this analysis and synthesis were further developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDOCTRINE OF ACID AND ALKALI.--SYLVIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG the results of mixture observed by chemists, were many\r\ninstances in which two ingredients, each in itself pungent or\r\ndestructive, being put together, became mild and inoperative; each\r\n{263} counteracting and neutralizing the activity of the other. The\r\nnotion of such opposition and neutrality is applicable to a very\r\nwide range of chemical processes. The person who appears first to\r\nhave steadily seized and generally applied this notion is Francis de\r\nla Boé Sylvius; who was born in 1614, and practised medicine at\r\nAmsterdam, with a success and reputation which gave great currency\r\nto his opinions on that art.[2\\14] His chemical theories were\r\npropounded as subordinate to his medical doctrines; and from being\r\nthus presented under a most important practical aspect, excited far\r\nmore attention than mere theoretical opinions on the composition of\r\nbodies could have done. Sylvius is spoken of by historians of\r\nscience, as the founder of the _iatro-chemical_ sect among\r\nphysicians; that is, the sect which considers the disorders in the\r\nhuman frame as the effects of chemical relations of the fluids, and\r\napplies to them modes of cure founded upon this doctrine. We have\r\nhere to speak, not of his physiological, but of his chemical views.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\14: Sprengel. _Geschichte der Arzneykunde_, vol. iv.\r\nThomson's _History of Chemistry_ in the corresponding part is\r\ntranslated from Sprengel.]\r\n\r\nThe distinction of _acid_ and _alkaline_ bodies (_acidum_,\r\n_lixivum_) was familiar before the time of Sylvius; but he framed a\r\nsystem, by considering them both as eminently acrid and yet\r\nopposite, and by applying this notion to the human frame. Thus[3\\14]\r\nthe lymph contains an acid, the bile an alkaline salt. These two\r\nopposite acrid substances, when they are brought together,\r\n_neutralize_ each other (_infringunt_), and are changed into an\r\nintermediate and milder substance.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\14: _De Methodo Medendi_, Amst. 1679. Lib. ii. cap. 28,\r\nsects. 8 and 53.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of this doctrine, as a physiological one, is an\r\nimportant part of the history of medical science in the seventeenth\r\ncentury; but with that we are not here concerned. But as a chemical\r\ndoctrine, this notion of the opposition of acid and alkali, and of\r\nits very general applicability, struck deep root, and has not been\r\neradicated up to our own time. Boyle, indeed, whose disposition led\r\nhim to suspect all generalities, expressed doubts with regard to\r\nthis view;[4\\14] and argued that the supposition of acid and\r\nalkaline parts in all bodies was precarious, their offices\r\narbitrary, and the notion of them unsettled. Indeed it was not\r\ndifficult to show, that there was no one certain criterion to which\r\nall supposed acids conformed. Yet the general conception of such a\r\ncombination as that of acid and alkali was supposed to {264} be,\r\nserved so well to express many chemical facts, that it kept its\r\nground. It is found, for instance, in Lemery's _Chemistry_, which\r\nwas one of those in most general use before the introduction of the\r\nphlogistic theory. In this work (which was translated into English\r\nby Keill, in 1698) we find alkalies defined by their effervescing\r\nwith acids.[5\\14] They were distinguished as the _mineral_ alkali\r\n(soda), the _vegetable_ alkali (potassa), and the _volatile_ alkali\r\n(ammonia). Again, in Macquer's _Chemistry_, which was long the\r\ntext-book in Europe during the reign of phlogiston, we find acids\r\nand alkalies, and their union, in which they rob each other of their\r\ncharacteristic properties, and form neutral salts, stated among the\r\nleading principles of the science.[6\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\14: Shaw's _Boyle_, iii. p. 432.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\14: Lemery, p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\14: Macquer, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nIn truth, the mutual relation of acids to alkalies was the most\r\nessential part of the knowledge which chemists possessed concerning\r\nthem. The importance of this relation arose from its being the first\r\ndistinct form in which the notion of chemical attraction or affinity\r\nappeared. For the acrid or caustic character of acids and alkalies\r\nis, in fact, a tendency to alter the bodies they touch, and thus to\r\nalter themselves; and the neutral character of the compounds **is\r\nthe absence of any such proclivity to change. Acids and alkalies\r\nhave a strong disposition to unite. They combine, often with\r\nvehemence, and produce neutral salts; they exhibit, in short, a\r\nprominent example of the chemical attraction, or affinity, by which\r\ntwo ingredients are formed into a compound. The relation of _acid_\r\nand _base_ in a salt is, to this day, one of the main grounds of all\r\ntheoretical reasonings.\r\n\r\nThe more distinct development of the notion of such chemical\r\nattraction, gradually made its way among the chemists of the latter\r\npart of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nas we may see in the writings of Boyle, Newton, and their followers.\r\nBeecher speaks of this attraction as a _magnetism_; but I do not\r\nknow that any writer in particular, can be pointed out as the person\r\nwho firmly established the general notion of _chemical attraction_.\r\n\r\nBut this idea of chemical attraction became both more clear and more\r\nextensively applicable, when it assumed the form of the doctrine of\r\n_elective_ attractions, in which shape we must now speak of it. {265}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDOCTRINE OF ELECTIVE ATTRACTIONS. GEOFFROY. BERGMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGH the chemical combinations of bodies had already been referred\r\nto attraction, in a vague and general manner, it was impossible to\r\nexplain the changes that take place, without supposing the\r\nattraction to be greater or less, according to the nature of the\r\nbody. Yet it was some time before the necessity of such a\r\nsupposition was clearly seen. In the history of the French Academy\r\nfor 1718 (published 1719), the writer of the introductory notice\r\n(probably Fontenelle) says, \"That a body which is united to another,\r\nfor example, a solvent which has penetrated a metal, should quit it\r\nto go and unite itself with another which we present to it, is a\r\nthing of which the possibility had never been guessed by the most\r\nsubtle philosophers, and of which the explanation even now is not\r\neasy.\" The doctrine had, in fact, been stated by Stahl, but the\r\nassertion just quoted shows, at least, that it was not familiar. The\r\nprinciple, however, is very clearly stated[7\\14] in a memoir in the\r\nsame volume, by Geoffroy, a French physician of great talents and\r\nvaried knowledge, \"We observe in chemistry,\" he says, \"certain\r\nrelations amongst different bodies, which cause them to unite. These\r\nrelations have their _degrees_ and their _laws_. We observe their\r\ndifferent degrees in this;--that among different matters jumbled\r\ntogether, which have a certain disposition to unite, we find that\r\none of these substances always unites constantly with a certain\r\nother, preferably to all the rest.\" He then states that those which\r\nunite by preference, have \"plus de rapport,\" or, according to a\r\nphrase afterwards used, more _affinity_. \"And I have satisfied\r\nmyself,\" he adds, \"that we may deduce, from these observations, the\r\nfollowing proposition, which is very extensively true, though I\r\ncannot enunciate it as universal, not having been able to examine\r\nall the possible combinations, to assure myself that I should find\r\nno exception.\" The proposition which he states in this admirable\r\nspirit of philosophical caution, is this: \"In all cases where two\r\nsubstances, {266} which have any disposition to combine, are united;\r\nif there approaches them a third, which has more affinity with one\r\nof the two, this one unites with the third and lets go the other.\"\r\nHe then states these affinities in the form of a Table; placing a\r\nsubstance at the head of each column, and other substances in\r\nsuccession below it, according to the order of their affinities for\r\nthe substance which stands at the head. He allows that the\r\nseparation is not always complete (an imperfection which he ascribes\r\nto the glutinosity of fluids and other causes), but, with such\r\nexceptions, he defends very resolutely and successfully his Table,\r\nand the notions which it implies.\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\14: _Mém. Acad. Par._ 1718, p. 202.]\r\n\r\nThe value of such a tabulation was immense at the time, and is even\r\nstill very great; it enabled the chemist to trace beforehand the\r\nresults of any operation; since, when the ingredients were given, he\r\ncould see which were the strongest of the affinities brought into\r\nplay, and, consequently, what compounds would be formed. Geoffroy\r\nhimself gave several good examples of this use of his table. It was\r\nspeedily adopted into works on chemistry. For instance,\r\nMacquer[8\\14] places it at the end of his book; \"taking it,\" as he\r\nsays, \"to be of great use at the end of an elementary tract, as it\r\ncollects into one point of view, the most essential and fundamental\r\ndoctrines which are dispersed through the work.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\14: Pref., p. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of _Elective Attraction_, as thus promulgated,\r\ncontained so large a mass of truth, that it was never seriously\r\nshaken, though it required further development and correction. In\r\nparticular the celebrated work of Torbern Bergman, professor at\r\nUpsala, _On Elective Attractions_, published in 1775, introduced\r\ninto it material improvements. Bergman observed, that not only the\r\norder of attractions, but the sum of those attractions which had to\r\nform the new compounds, must be taken account of, in order to judge\r\nof the result. Thus,[9\\14] if we have a combination of two elements,\r\n_P_, _s_, (potassa and vitriolic acid), and another combination,\r\n_L_, _m_, (lime and muriatic acid,) though _s_ has a greater\r\naffinity for _P_ than for _L_, yet the sum of the attractions of _P_\r\nto _m_, and of _L_ to _s_, is greater than that of the original\r\ncompounds, and therefore if the two combinations are brought\r\ntogether, the new compounds, _P_, _m_, and _L_, _s_, are formed.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\14: _Elect. Attract._, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe Table of Elective Attractions, modified by Bergman in pursuance\r\nof these views, and corrected according to the advanced knowledge of\r\nthe time, became still more important than before. The next step\r\n{267} was to take into account the quantities of the elements which\r\ncombined; but this leads us into a new train of investigation, which\r\nwas, indeed, a natural sequel to the researches of Geoffroy and\r\nBergman.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, however, a chemist of great eminence, Berthollet, published\r\na work (_Essai de Statique Chimique_), the tendency of which\r\nappeared to be to throw the subject back into the condition in which\r\nit had been before Geoffroy. For Berthollet maintained that the\r\nrules of chemical combination were not definite, and dependent on\r\nthe nature of the substances alone, but indefinite, depending on the\r\nquantity present, and other circumstances. Proust answered him, and\r\nas Berzelius says,[10\\14] \"Berthollet defended himself with an\r\nacuteness which makes the reader hesitate in his judgment; but the\r\ngreat mass of facts finally decided the point in favor of Proust.\"\r\nBefore, however, we trace the result of these researches, we must\r\nconsider Chemistry as extending her inquiries to combustion as well\r\nas mixture, to airs as well as fluids and solids, and to weight as\r\nwell as quality. These three steps we shall now briefly treat of.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\14: _Chem._ t. iii. p. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDOCTRINE OF ACIDIFICATION AND COMBUSTION.--PHLOGISTIC THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION _of the Theory by Beccher and Stahl._--It will be\r\nrecollected that we are tracing the history of the _progress_ only\r\nof Chemistry, not of its errors;--that we are concerned with\r\ndoctrines only so far as they are true, and have remained part of\r\nthe received system of chemical truths. The Phlogistic Theory was\r\ndeposed and succeeded by the Theory of Oxygen. But this circumstance\r\nmust not lead us to overlook the really sound and permanent part of\r\nthe opinions which the founders of the phlogistic theory taught.\r\nThey brought together, as processes of the same kind, a number of\r\nchanges which at first appeared to have nothing in common; as\r\nacidification, combustion, respiration. Now this classification is\r\ntrue; and its importance remains undiminished, whatever are the\r\nexplanations which we adopt of the processes themselves.\r\n\r\nThe two chemists to whom are to be ascribed the merit of this step,\r\nand the establishment of the _phlogistic theory_ which they\r\nconnected {268} with it, are John Joachim Beccher and George Ernest\r\nStahl; the former of whom was professor at Mentz, and physician to\r\nthe Elector of Bavaria (born 1625, died 1682); the latter was\r\nprofessor at Halle, and afterwards royal physician at Berlin (born\r\n1660, died 1734). These two men, who thus contributed to a common\r\npurpose, were very different from each other. The first was a frank\r\nand ardent enthusiast in the pursuit of chemistry, who speaks of\r\nhimself and his employments with a communicativeness and affection\r\nboth amusing and engaging. The other was a teacher of great talents\r\nand influence, but accused of haughtiness and moroseness; a\r\ncharacter which is well borne out by the manner in which, in his\r\nwritings, he anticipates an unfavorable reception, and defies it.\r\nBut it is right to add to this that he speaks of Beccher, his\r\npredecessor, with an ungrudging acknowledgment of obligations to\r\nhim, and a vehement assertion of his merit as the founder of the\r\ntrue system, which give a strong impression of Stahl's justice and\r\nmagnanimity.\r\n\r\nBeccher's opinions were at first promulgated rather as a correction\r\nthan a refutation of the doctrine of the three principles, salt,\r\nsulphur, and mercury. The main peculiarity of his views consists in\r\nthe offices which he ascribes to his _sulphur_, these being such as\r\nafterwards induced Stahl to give the name of _Phlogiston_ to this\r\nelement. Beccher had the sagacity to see that the reduction of\r\nmetals to an earthy form (_calx_), and the formation of sulphuric\r\nacid from sulphur, are operations connected by a general analogy, as\r\nbeing alike processes of combustion. Hence the metal was supposed to\r\nconsist of an earth, and of something which, in the process of\r\ncombustion, was separated from it; and, in like manner, sulphur was\r\nsupposed to consist of the sulphuric acid, which remained after its\r\ncombustion, and of the combustible part or true sulphur, which flew\r\noff in the burning. Beccher insists very distinctly upon this\r\ndifference between his element sulphur and the \"sulphur\" of his\r\nParacelsian predecessors.\r\n\r\nIt must be considered as indicating great knowledge and talent in\r\nStahl, that he perceived so clearly what part of the views of\r\nBeccher was of general truth and permanent value. Though he[11\\14]\r\neverywhere gives to Beccher the credit of the theoretical opinions\r\nwhich he promulgates, (\"Beccheriana sunt quæ profero,\") it seems\r\ncertain that he had the merit, not only of proving them more\r\ncompletely, and applying them more widely than his forerunner, but\r\nalso of conceiving them {269} with a distinctness which Beccher did\r\nnot attain. In 1697, appeared Stahl's _Zymotechnia Fundamentalis_\r\n(the Doctrine of Fermentation), \"simulque _experimentum novum_\r\nsulphur verum arte producendi.\" In this work (besides other tenets\r\nwhich the author considered as very important), the opinion\r\npublished by Beccher was now maintained in a very distinct\r\nform;--namely, that the process of forming sulphur from sulphuric\r\nacid, and of restoring the metals from their calces, are analogous,\r\nand consist alike in the addition of some combustible element, which\r\nStahl termed _phlogiston_ (φλογίστον, _combustible_). The experiment\r\nmost insisted on in the work now spoken of,[12\\14] was the formation\r\nof sulphur from sulphate of potass (or of soda) by fusing the salt\r\nwith an alkali, and throwing in coals to supply phlogiston. This is\r\nthe \"experimentum novum.\" Though Stahl published an account of this\r\nprocess, he seems to have regretted his openness. \"He denies not,\"\r\nhe says, \"that he should peradventure have dissembled this\r\nexperiment as the true foundation of the Beccherian assertion\r\nconcerning the nature of sulphur, if he had not been provoked by the\r\npretending arrogance of some of his contemporaries.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\14: **Stahl, _Præf. ad Specim. Becch._ 1703.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\14: P. 117.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time, Stahl's confidence in his theory may be traced\r\nbecoming more and more settled in his succeeding publications. It is\r\nhardly necessary to observe here, that the explanations which his\r\ntheory gives are easily transformed into those which the more recent\r\ntheory supplies. According to modern views, the addition of oxygen\r\ntakes place in the formation of acids and of calces, and in\r\ncombustion, instead of the subtraction of phlogiston. The coal which\r\nStahl supposed to supply the combustible in his experiment, does in\r\nfact absorb the liberated oxygen. In like manner, when an acid\r\ncorrodes a metal, and, according to existing theory, combines with\r\nand oxidates it, Stahl supposed that the phlogiston separated from\r\nthe metal and combined with the acid. That the explanations of the\r\nphlogistic theory are so generally capable of being translated into\r\nthe oxygen theory, merely by inverting the supposed transfer of the\r\ncombustible element, shows us how important a step towards the\r\nmodern doctrines the phlogistic theory really was.\r\n\r\nThe question, whether these processes were in fact addition or\r\nsubtraction, was decided by the balance, and belongs to a succeeding\r\nperiod of the science. But we may observe, that both Beccher and\r\nStahl were aware of the increase of weight which metals undergo in\r\n{270} calcination; although the time had not yet arrived in which\r\nthis fact was to be made one of the bases of the theory.\r\n\r\nIt has been said,[13\\14] that in the adoption of the phlogistic\r\ntheory, that is, in supposing the above-mentioned processes to be\r\naddition rather than subtraction, \"of two possible roads the wrong\r\nwas chosen, as if to prove the perversity of the human mind.\" But we\r\nmust not forget how natural it was to suppose that some part of a\r\nbody was _destroyed_ or _removed_ by combustion; and we may observe,\r\nthat the merit of Beccher and Stahl did not consist in the selection\r\nof one road or two, but in advancing so far as to reach this point\r\nof separation. That, having done this, they went a little further on\r\nthe wrong line, was an error which detracted little from the merit\r\nor value of the progress really made. It would be easy to show, from\r\nthe writings of phlogistic chemists, what important and extensive\r\ntruths their theory enabled them to express simply and clearly.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\14: Herschel's _Introd. to Nat. Phil._ p. 300.]\r\n\r\nThat an enthusiastic temper is favorable to the production of great\r\ndiscoveries in science, is a rule which suffers no exception in the\r\ncharacter of Beccher. In his preface[14\\14] addressed \"to the\r\nbenevolent reader\" of his _Physica Subterranea_, he speaks of the\r\nchemists as a strange class of mortals, impelled by an almost insane\r\nimpulse to seek their pleasure among smoke and vapor, soot and\r\nflame, poisons and poverty. \"Yet among all these evils,\" he says, \"I\r\nseem to myself to live so sweetly, that, may I die if I would change\r\nplaces with the Persian king.\" He is, indeed, well worthy of\r\nadmiration, as one of the first who pursued the labors of the\r\nfurnace and the laboratory, without the bribe of golden hopes. \"My\r\nkingdom,\" he says, \"is not of this world. I trust that I have got\r\nhold of my pitcher by the right handle,--the true method of treating\r\nthis study. For the _Pseudochymists_ seek gold; but the _true\r\nphilosophers_, science, which is more precious than any gold.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\14: Frankfort, 1681.]\r\n\r\nThe _Physica Subterranea_ made no converts. Stahl, in his indignant\r\nmanner, says,[15\\14] \"No one will wonder that it never yet obtained a\r\nphysician or a chemist as a disciple, still less as an advocate.\" And\r\nagain, \"This work obtained very little reputation or estimation, or,\r\nto speak ingenuously, as far as I know, none whatever.\" In 1671,\r\nBeccher published a supplement to his work, in which he showed how\r\nmetal might be extracted from mud and sand. He offered to execute\r\n{271} this at Vienna; but found that people there cared nothing about\r\nsuch novelties. He was then induced, by Baron D'Isola, to go to\r\nHolland for similar purposes. After various delays and quarrels, he\r\nwas obliged to leave Holland for fear of his creditors; and then, I\r\nsuppose, came to Great Britain, where he examined the Scottish and\r\nCornish mines. He is said to have died in London in 1682.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\14: Præf. _Phys. Sub._ 1703.]\r\n\r\nStahl's publications appear to have excited more notice, and led to\r\ncontroversy on the \"so-called sulphur.\" The success of the\r\nexperiment had been doubted, which, as he remarks, it was foolish to\r\nmake a matter of discussion, when any one might decide the point by\r\nexperiment; and finally, it had been questioned whether the\r\nsubstance obtained by this process were pure sulphur. The\r\noriginality of his doctrine was also questioned, which, as he says,\r\ncould not with any justice be impugned. He published in defence and\r\ndevelopment of his opinion at various intervals, as the _Specimen\r\nBeccherianum_ in 1703, the _Documentum Theoriæ Beecherianæ_, a\r\nDissertation _De Anatomia Sulphuris Artificialis_; and finally,\r\n_Casual Thoughts on the so-called Sulphur_, in 1718, in which he\r\ngave (in German) both a historical and a systematic view of his\r\nopinions on the nature of salts and of his Phlogiston.\r\n\r\n_Reception and Application of the Theory._--The theory that the\r\nformation of sulphuric acid, and the restoration of metals from\r\ntheir calces, are analogous processes, and consist in the addition\r\nof _phlogiston_, was soon widely received; and the Phlogistic School\r\nwas thus established. From Berlin, its original seat, it was\r\ndiffused into all parts of Europe. The general reception of the\r\ntheory may be traced, not only in the use of the term \"phlogiston,\"\r\nand of the explanations which it implies; but in the adoption of a\r\nnomenclature founded on those explanations, which, though not very\r\nextensive, is sufficient evidence of the prevalence of the theory.\r\nThus when Priestley, in 1774, discovered oxygen, and when Scheele, a\r\nlittle later, discovered chlorine, these gases were termed\r\n_dephlogisticated air_, and _dephlogisticated marine acid_; while\r\nazotic acid gas, having no disposition to combustion, was supposed\r\nto be saturated with phlogiston, and was called _phlogisticated air_.\r\n\r\nThis phraseology kept its ground, till it was expelled by the\r\nantiphlogistic, or oxygen theory. For instance. Cavendish's papers\r\non the chemistry of the airs are expressed in terms of it, although\r\nhis researches led him to the confines of the new theory. We must\r\nnow give an account of such researches, and of the consequent\r\nrevolution in the science. {272}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF GASES.--BLACK. CAVENDISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE study of the properties of aëriform substances, or Pneumatic\r\nChemistry, as it was called, occupied the chemists of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and was the main occasion of the great advances which the\r\nscience made at that period. The most material general truths which\r\ncame into view in the course of these researches, were, that gases\r\nwere to be numbered among the constituent elements of solid and\r\nfluid bodies; and that, in these, as in all other cases of\r\ncomposition, the compound was equal to the sum of its elements. The\r\nlatter proposition, indeed, cannot be looked upon as a discovery,\r\nfor it had been frequently acknowledged, though little applied; in\r\nfact, it could not be referred to with any advantage, till the\r\naëriform elements, as well as others, were taken into the account.\r\nAs soon as this was done, it produced a revolution in chemistry.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Though the view of the mode in which gaseous elements\r\nbecome fixed in bodies and determine their properties, had great\r\nadditional light thrown upon it by Dr. Black's discoveries, as we\r\nshall see, the notion that solid bodies involve such gaseous\r\nelements was not new at that period. Mr. Vernon Harcourt has\r\nshown[16\\14] that Newton and Boyle admitted into their speculations\r\nairs of various kinds, capable of fixation in bodies. I have, in the\r\nsucceeding chapter (chap. vi.), spoken of the views of Rey, Hooke,\r\nand Mayow, connected with the function of airs in chemistry, and\r\nforming a prelude to the Oxygen Theory.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\14: _Phil. Mag._ 1846.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these preludes, the credit of the first great step\r\nin pneumatic chemistry is, with justice, assigned to Dr. Black,\r\nafterwards professor at Edinburgh, but a young man of the age of\r\ntwenty-four at the time when he made his discovery.[17\\14] He found\r\nthat the difference between caustic lime and common limestone arose\r\nfrom this, that the latter substance consists of the former,\r\ncombined with a certain air, which, being thus fixed in the solid\r\nbody, he called _fixed air_ (carbonic {273} acid gas). He found,\r\ntoo, that magnesia, caustic potash, and caustic soda, would combine\r\nwith the same air, with similar results. This discovery consisted,\r\nof course, in a new interpretation of observed changes. Alkalies\r\nappeared to be made caustic by contact with quicklime: at first\r\nBlack imagined that they underwent this change by acquiring igneous\r\nmatter from the quicklime; but when he perceived that the lime\r\ngained, not lost, in magnitude as it became mild, he rightly\r\nsupposed that the alkalies were rendered caustic by imparting their\r\nair to the lime. This discovery was announced in Black's inaugural\r\ndissertation, pronounced in 1755, on the occasion of his taking his\r\ndegree of Doctor in the University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\14: Thomson's _Hist. Chem._ i. 317.]\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of airs was pursued by other experimenters. The\r\nHonorable Henry Cavendish, about 1765, invented an apparatus, in\r\nwhich aërial fluids are confined by water, so that they can be\r\nmanaged and examined. This hydro-pneumatic apparatus, or as it is\r\nsometimes called, _the pneumatic trough_, from that time was one of\r\nthe most indispensable parts of the chemist's apparatus.\r\nCavendish,[18\\14] in 1766, showed the identity of the properties of\r\nfixed air derived from various sources; and pointed out the peculiar\r\nqualities of _inflammable air_ (afterwards called hydrogen gas),\r\nwhich, being nine times lighter than common air, soon attracted\r\ngeneral notice by its employment for raising balloons. The promise\r\nof discovery which this subject now offered, attracted the confident\r\nand busy mind of Priestley, whose _Experiments and Observations on\r\ndifferent kinds of Air_ appeared in 1744-79. In these volumes, he\r\ndescribes an extraordinary number of trials of various kinds; the\r\nresults of which were, the discovery of new kinds of air, namely,\r\n_phlogisticated air_ (azotic gas), _nitrous air_ (nitrous gas), and\r\n_dephlogisticated air_ (oxygen gas).\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1766.]\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of new substances, though valuable in supplying\r\nchemistry with materials, was not so important as discoveries\r\nrespecting their modes of composition. Among such discoveries, that of\r\nCavendish, published in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1784, and\r\ndisclosing the composition of water by the union of two gases, oxygen\r\nand hydrogen, must be considered as holding a most distinguished\r\nplace. He states,[19\\14] that his \"experiments were made principally\r\nwith a view to find out the cause of the diminution which common air\r\nis well known to suffer, by all the various ways in which it is\r\nphlogisticated.\" And, after describing various unsuccessful attempts,\r\nhe finds {274} that when inflammable air is used in this\r\nphlogistication (or burning), the diminution of the common air is\r\naccompanied by the formation of a dew in the apparatus.[20\\14] And\r\nthus he infers[21\\14] that \"almost all the inflammable air, and\r\none-fifth of the common air, are turned into pure water.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1784, p. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1784, p. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\14: Ib. p. 129.]\r\n\r\nLavoisier, to whose researches this result was, as we shall soon\r\nsee, very important, was employed in a similar attempt at the same\r\ntime (1783), and had already succeeded,[22\\14] when he learned from\r\nDr. Blagden, who was present at the experiment, that Cavendish had\r\nmade the discovery a few months sooner. Monge had, about the same\r\ntime, made the same experiments, and communicated the result to\r\nLavoisier and Laplace immediately afterwards. The synthesis was soon\r\nconfirmed by a corresponding analysis. Indeed the discovery\r\nundoubtedly lay in the direct path of chemical research at the time.\r\nIt was of great consequence in the view it gave of experiments in\r\ncomposition; for the small quantity of water produced in many such\r\nprocesses, had been quite overlooked; though, as it now appeared,\r\nthis water offered the key to the whole interpretation of the change.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\14: _A. P._ 1781, p. 472]\r\n\r\nThough some objections to Mr. Cavendish's view were offered by\r\nKirwan,[23\\14] on the whole they were generally received with assent\r\nand admiration. But the bearing of these discoveries upon the new\r\ntheory of Lavoisier, who rejected phlogiston, was so close, that we\r\ncannot further trace the history of the subject without proceeding\r\nimmediately to that theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\14: _P. T._ 1784, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I have elsewhere stated,[24\\14]--with reference to recent\r\nattempts to deprive Cavendish of the credit of his discovery of the\r\ncomposition of water, and to transfer it to Watt,--that Watt not\r\nonly did not anticipate, but did not fully appreciate the discovery\r\nof Cavendish and Lavoisier; and I have expressed my concurrence with\r\nMr. Vernon Harcourt's views, when he says,[25\\14] that \"Cavendish\r\npared off from the current hypotheses their theory of combustion,\r\nand their affinities of imponderable for ponderable matter, as\r\ncomplicating chemical with physical considerations; and he then\r\ncorrected and adjusted them with admirable skill to the actual\r\nphenomena, not binding the facts to the theory, but adapting the\r\ntheory to the facts.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\14: _Philosophy_, b. vi. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\14: _Address to the British Association_, 1839.]\r\n\r\nI conceive that the discussion which the subject has recently\r\nreceived, has left no doubt on the mind of any one who has perused\r\nthe {275} documents, that Cavendish is justly entitled to the honor\r\nof this discovery, which in his own time was never contested. The\r\npublication of his Journals of Experiments[26\\14] shows that he\r\nsucceeded in establishing the point in question in July, 1781. His\r\nexperiments are referred to in an abstract of a paper of\r\nPriestley's, made by Dr. Maty, the secretary of the Royal Society,\r\nin June, 1783. In June, 1783, also, Dr. Blagden communicated the\r\nresult of Cavendish's experiments to Lavoisier, at Paris. Watt's\r\nletter, containing his hypothesis that \"water is composed of\r\ndephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived of part of their latent\r\nor elementary heat; and that phlogisticated or pure air is composed\r\nof water deprived of its phlogiston and united to elementary heat\r\nand light,\" was not read till Nov. 1783; and even if it could have\r\nsuggested such an experiment as Cavendish's (which does not appear\r\nlikely), is proved, by the dates, to have had no share in doing so.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\14: _Appendix_ to Mr. V. Harcourt's _Address_]\r\n\r\nMr. Cavendish's experiment was suggested by an experiment in which\r\nWarltire, a lecturer on chemistry at Birmingham, exploded a mixture\r\nof hydrogen and common air in a close vessel, in order to determine\r\nwhether heat were ponderable.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nEPOCH OF THE THEORY OF OXYGEN.--LAVOISIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Prelude to the Theory.--Its Publication._\r\n\r\nWE arrive now at a great epoch in the history of Chemistry. Few\r\nrevolutions in science have immediately excited so much general\r\nnotice as the introduction of the theory of oxygen. The simplicity\r\nand symmetry of the modes of combination which it assumed; and,\r\nabove all, the construction and universal adoption of a nomenclature\r\nwhich applied to all substances, and which seemed to reveal their\r\ninmost constitution by their name, naturally gave it an almost\r\nirresistible sway over men's minds. We must, however,\r\ndispassionately trace the course of its introduction. {276}\r\n\r\nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier, an accomplished French chemist, had\r\npursued, with zeal and skill, researches such as those of Black,\r\nCavendish, and Priestley, which we have described above. In 1774, he\r\nshowed that, in the calcination of metals in air, the metal acquires\r\nas much weight as the air loses. It might appear that this discovery\r\nat once overturned the view which supposed the metal to be phlogiston\r\n_added_ to the calx. Lavoisier's contemporaries were, however, far\r\nfrom allowing this; a greater mass of argument was needed to bring\r\nthem to this conclusion. Convincing proofs of the new opinion were,\r\nhowever, rapidly supplied. Thus, when Priestley had discovered\r\ndephlogisticated air, in 1774, Lavoisier showed, in 1776, that fixed\r\nair consisted of charcoal and the dephlogisticated or pure air; for\r\nthe mercurial calx which, heated by itself, gives out pure air, gives\r\nout, when heated with charcoal, fixed air,[27\\14] which has,\r\ntherefore, since been called _carbonic acid gas_.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\14: _Mém. Ac. Par._ 1775.]\r\n\r\nAgain, Lavoisier showed that the atmospheric air consists of pure or\r\nvital air, and of an _unvital_ air, which he thence called _azot_.\r\nThe vital air he found to be the agent in combustion, acidification,\r\ncalcination, respiration; all of these processes were analogous: all\r\nconsisted in a decomposition of the atmospheric air, and a fixation\r\nof the pure or vital portion of it.\r\n\r\nBut he thus arrived at the conclusion, that this pure air was added,\r\nin all the cases in which, according to the received theory,\r\n_phlogiston_ was subtracted, and _vice versâ_. He gave the\r\nname[28\\14] of _oxygen_ (_principe oxygène_) to \"the substance which\r\nthus unites itself with metals to form their calces, and with\r\ncombustible substances to form acids.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\14: _Mém. Ac. Par._ 1781, p. 448.]\r\n\r\nA new theory was thus produced, which would account for all the\r\nfacts which the old one would explain, and had besides the evidence\r\nof the balance in its favor. But there still remained some apparent\r\nobjections to be removed. In the action of dilute acids on metals,\r\ninflammable air was produced. Whence came this element? The\r\ndiscovery of the decomposition of water sufficiently answered this\r\nquestion, and converted the objection into an argument on the side\r\nof the theory: and thus the decomposition of water was, in fact, one\r\nof the most critical events for the fortune of the Lavoisierian\r\ndoctrine, and one which, more than any other, decided chemists in\r\nits favor. In succeeding years, Lavoisier showed the consistency of\r\nhis theory with {277} all that was discovered concerning the\r\ncomposition of alcohol, oil, animal and vegetable substances, and\r\nmany other bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for us to consider any further the evidence for\r\nthis theory, but we must record a few circumstances respecting its\r\nearlier history. Rey, a French physician, had in 1630, published a\r\nbook, in which he inquires into the grounds of the increase of the\r\nweight of metals by calcination.[29\\14] He says, \"To this question,\r\nthen, supported on the grounds already mentioned, I answer, and\r\nmaintain with confidence, that the increase of weight arises from\r\nthe air, which is condensed, rendered heavy and adhesive, by the\r\nheat of the furnace.\" Hooke and Mayow had entertained the opinion\r\nthat the air contains a \"nitrous spirit,\" which is the supporter of\r\ncombustion. But Lavoisier disclaimed the charge of having derived\r\nanything from these sources; nor is it difficult to understand how\r\nthe received generalizations of the phlogistic theory had thrown all\r\nsuch narrower explanations into obscurity. The merit of Lavoisier\r\nconsisted in his combining the generality of Stahl with the verified\r\nconjectures of Rey and Mayow.\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\14: Thomson, _Hist. Chem._ ii. 95.]\r\n\r\nNo one could have a better claim, by his early enthusiasm for\r\nscience, his extensive knowledge, and his zealous labors, to hope\r\nthat a great discovery might fall to his share, than Lavoisier. His\r\nfather,[30\\14] a man of considerable fortune, had allowed him to\r\nmake science his only profession; and the zealous philosopher\r\ncollected about him a number of the most active physical inquirers\r\nof his time, who met and experimented at his house one day in the\r\nweek. In this school, the new chemistry was gradually formed. A few\r\nyears after the publication of Priestley's first experiments,\r\nLavoisier was struck with the presentiment of the theory which he\r\nwas afterwards to produce. In 1772, he deposited[31\\14] with the\r\nsecretary of the Academy, a note which contained the germ of his\r\nfuture doctrines. \"At that time,\" he says, in explaining this step,\r\n\"there was a kind of rivalry between France and England in science,\r\nwhich gave importance to new experiments, and which sometimes was\r\nthe cause that the writers of the one or other of the nations\r\ndisputed the discovery with the real author.\" In 1777, the editor of\r\nthe Memoirs of the Academy speaks of his theory as overturning that\r\nof Stahl; but the general acceptance of the new opinion did not take\r\nplace till later. {278}\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\14: _Biogr. Univ._ (Cuvier.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\14: Thomson, ii. 99.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Reception and Confirmation of the Theory of Oxygen._\r\n\r\nTHE Oxygen Theory made its way with extraordinary rapidity among the\r\nbest philosophers.[32\\14] In 1785, that is, soon after Cavendish's\r\nsynthesis of water had removed some of the most formidable\r\nobjections to it, Berthollet, already an eminent chemist, declared\r\nhimself a convert. Indeed it was so soon generally adopted in\r\nFrance, that Fourcroy promulgated its doctrines under the name of\r\n\"La Chimie Française,\" a title which Lavoisier did not altogether\r\nrelish. The extraordinary eloquence and success of Fourcroy as a\r\nlecturer at the Jardin des Plantes, had no small share in the\r\ndiffusion of the oxygen theory; and the name of \"the apostle of the\r\nnew chemistry\" which was at first given him in ridicule, was justly\r\nheld by him to be a glorious distinction.[33\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\14: Thomson, ii. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\14: Cuvier, _Eloges_, i. p. 20.]\r\n\r\nGuyton de Morveau, who had at first been a strenuous advocate of the\r\nphlogistic theory, was invited to Paris, and brought over to the\r\nopinions of Lavoisier; and soon joined in the formation of the\r\nnomenclature founded upon the theory. This step, of which we shall\r\nshortly speak, fixed the new doctrine, and diffused it further.\r\nDelametherie alone defended the phlogistic theory with vigor, and\r\nindeed with violence. He was the editor of the _Journal de\r\nPhysique_, and to evade the influence which this gave him, the\r\nantiphlogistians[34\\14] established, as the vehicle of their\r\nopinions, another periodical, the _Annales de Chimie_.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\14: Thomson, ii. 133.]\r\n\r\nIn England, indeed, their success was not so immediate.\r\nCavendish,[35\\14] in his Memoir of 1784, speaks of the question\r\nbetween the two opinions as doubtful. \"There are,\" he says, \"several\r\nMemoirs of M. Lavoisier, in which he entirely discards phlogiston; and\r\nas not only the foregoing experiments, but most other phenomena of\r\nnature, seem explicable as well, or nearly as well, upon this as upon\r\nthe commonly believed principle of phlogiston,\" Cavendish proceeds to\r\nexplain his experiments according to the new views, expressing no\r\ndecided preference, however, for either system. But Kirwan, another\r\nEnglish chemist, contested the point much more resolutely. His theory\r\nidentified inflammable air, or hydrogen, with phlogiston; and in this\r\nview, he wrote a work which was intended as a confutation of {279} the\r\nessential part of the oxygen theory. It is a strong proof of the\r\nsteadiness and clearness with which the advocates of the new system\r\npossessed their principles, that they immediately translated this\r\nwork, adding, at the end of each chapter, a refutation of the\r\nphlogistic doctrines which it contained. Lavoisier, Berthollet, De\r\nMorveau, Fourcroy, and Monge, were the authors of this curious\r\nspecimen of scientific polemics. It is also remarkable evidence of the\r\ncandor of Kirwan, that notwithstanding the prominent part he had taken\r\nin the controversy, he allowed himself at last to be convinced. After\r\na struggle of ten years, he wrote[36\\14] to Berthollet in 1796, \"I lay\r\ndown my arms, and abandon the cause of phlogiston.\" Black followed the\r\nsame course. Priestley alone, of all the chemists of great name, would\r\nnever assent to the new doctrines, though his own discoveries had\r\ncontributed so much to their establishment. \"He saw,\" says\r\nCuvier,[37\\14] \"without flinching, the most skilful defenders of the\r\nancient theory go over to the enemy in succession; and when Kirwan\r\nhad, almost the last of all, abjured phlogiston, Priestley remained\r\nalone on the field of battle, and threw out a new challenge, in a\r\nmemoir addressed to the principal French chemists.\" It happened,\r\ncuriously enough, that the challenge was accepted, and the arguments\r\nanswered by M. Adet, who was at that time (1798,) the French\r\nambassador to the United States, in which country Priestley's work was\r\npublished. Even in Germany, the birth-place and home of the phlogistic\r\ntheory, the struggle was not long protracted. There was, indeed, a\r\ncontroversy, the older philosophers being, as usual, the defenders of\r\nthe established doctrines; but in 1792, Klaproth repeated, before the\r\nAcademy of Berlin, all the fundamental experiments; and \"the result\r\nwas a full conviction on the part of Klaproth and the Academy, that\r\nthe Lavoisierian theory was the true one.\"[38\\14] Upon the whole, the\r\nintroduction of the Lavoisierian theory in the scientific world, when\r\ncompared with the great revolution of opinion to which it comes\r\nnearest in importance, the introduction of the Newtonian theory,\r\nshows, by the rapidity and temper with which it took place, a great\r\nimprovement, both in the means of arriving at truth, and in the spirit\r\nwith which they were used.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1784, p. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\14: Pref. to Fourcroy's _Chemistry_, xiv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\14: Cuvier, _Eloge de Priestley_, p. 208.]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\14: Thomson, vol. ii. p. 136.]\r\n\r\nSome English writers[39\\14] have expressed an opinion that there was\r\n{280} little that was original in the new doctrines. But if they\r\nwere so obvious, what are we to say of eminent chemists, as Black\r\nand Cavendish, who hesitated when they were presented, or Kirwan and\r\nPriestley, who rejected them? This at least shows that it required\r\nsome peculiar insight to see the evidence of these truths. To say\r\nthat most of the materials of Lavoisier's theory existed before him,\r\nis only to say that his great merit was, that which must always be\r\nthe great merit of a new theory, his generalization. The effect\r\nwhich the publication of his doctrines produced, shows us that he\r\nwas the first person who, possessing clearly the idea of\r\nquantitative composition, applied it steadily to a great range of\r\nwell-ascertained facts. This is, as we have often had to observe,\r\nprecisely the universal description of an inductive discoverer. It\r\nhas been objected, in like manner, to the originality of Newton's\r\ndiscoveries, that they were contained in those of Kepler. They were\r\nso, but they needed a Newton to find them there. The originality of\r\nthe theory of oxygen is proved by the conflict, short as it was,\r\nwhich accompanied its promulgation; its importance is shown by the\r\nchanges which it soon occasioned in every part of the science.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\14: Brande, _Hist. Diss._ in _Enc, Brit._ p. 182. Lunn,\r\n_Chem._ in _Enc. Met._ p. 596.]\r\n\r\nThus Lavoisier, far more fortunate than most of those who had, in\r\nearlier ages, produced revolutions in science, saw his theory\r\naccepted by all the most eminent men of his time, and established\r\nover a great part of Europe within a few years from its first\r\npromulgation. In the common course of events, it might have been\r\nexpected that the later years of his life would have been spent amid\r\nthe admiration and reverence which naturally wait upon the patriarch\r\nof a new system of acknowledged truths. But the times in which he\r\nlived allowed no such euthanasia to eminence of any kind. The\r\ndemocracy which overthrew the ancient political institutions of\r\nFrance, and swept away the nobles of the land, was not, as might\r\nhave been expected, enthusiastic in its admiration of a great\r\nrevolution in science, and forward to offer its homage to the\r\ngenuine nobility of a great discoverer. Lavoisier was thrown into\r\nprison on some wretched charge of having, in the discharge of a\r\npublic office which he had held, adulterated certain tobacco; but in\r\nreality, for the purpose of confiscating his property.[40\\14] In his\r\nimprisonment, his philosophy was his resource; and he employed\r\nhimself in the preparation of his papers for printing. When he was\r\nbrought before the revolutionary tribunal, he begged for a respite\r\nof a few days, in order to complete some researches, the results of\r\nwhich {281} were, he said, important to the good of humanity. The\r\nbrutish idiot, whom the state of the country at that time had placed\r\nin the judgment-seat, told him that the republic wanted no sçavans.\r\nHe was dragged to the guillotine, May the 8th, 1794, and beheaded,\r\nin the fifty-second year of his age; a melancholy proof that, in\r\nperiods of political ferocity, innocence and merit, private virtues\r\nand public services, amiable manners and the love of friends,\r\nliterary fame and exalted genius, are all as nothing to protect\r\ntheir possessor from the last extremes of violence and wrong,\r\ninflicted under judicial forms.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\14: _Biog. Univ._ (Cuvier.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Nomenclature of the Oxygen Theory._\r\n\r\nAS we have already said, a powerful instrument in establishing and\r\ndiffusing the new chemical theory, was a Systematic Nomenclature\r\nfounded upon it, and applicable to all chemical compounds, which was\r\nsoon constructed and published by the authors of the theory. Such a\r\nnomenclature made its way into general use the more easily, in that\r\nthe want of such a system had already been severely felt; the names\r\nin common use being fantastical, arbitrary, and multiplied beyond\r\nmeasure. The number of known substances had become so great, that a\r\nlist of names with no regulative principle, founded on accident,\r\ncaprice, and error, was too cumbrous and inconvenient to be\r\ntolerated. Even before the currency which Lavoisier's theory\r\nobtained, these evils had led to attempts towards a more convenient\r\nset of names. Bergman and Black had constructed such lists; and\r\nGuyton de Morveau, a clever and accomplished lawyer of Dijon, had\r\nformed a system of nomenclature in 1782, before he had become a\r\nconvert to Lavoisier's theory, in which task he had been exhorted\r\nand encouraged by Bergman and Macquer. In this system,[41\\14] we do\r\nnot find most of the characters of the method which was afterwards\r\nadopted. But a few years later, Lavoisier, De Morveau, Berthollet\r\nand Fourcroy, associated themselves for the purpose of producing a\r\nnomenclature which should correspond to the new theoretical views.\r\nThis appeared in 1787, and soon made its way into general use. The\r\nmain features of this system are, a selection of the simplest\r\nradical words, by which substances are designated, and a systematic\r\ndistribution of terminations, to express their relations. Thus,\r\nsulphur, combined with oxygen in two different proportions, forms\r\ntwo acids, the {282} sulphur_ous_ and the sulphur_ic_; and these\r\nacids form, with earthy or alkaline bases, sulph_ides_ and\r\nsulph_ates_; while sulphur directly combined with another element,\r\nforms a sulph_uret_. The term _oxyd_ (now usually written _oxide_)\r\nexpressed a lower degree of combination with oxygen than the acids.\r\nThe _Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique_ was published in 1787; and in\r\n1789, Lavoisier published a treatise on chemistry in order further\r\nto explain this method. In the preface to this volume, he apologizes\r\nfor the great amount of the changes, and pleads the authority of\r\nBergman, who had exhorted De Morveau \"to spare no improper names;\r\nthose who are learned will always be learned, and those who are\r\nignorant will thus learn sooner.\" To this maxim they so far\r\nconformed, that their system offers few anomalies; and though the\r\nprogress of discovery, and the consequent changes of theoretical\r\nopinion, which have since gone on, appear now to require a further\r\nchange of nomenclature, it is no small evidence of the skill with\r\nwhich this scheme was arranged, that for half a century it was\r\nuniversally used, and felt to be far more useful and effective than\r\nany nomenclature in any science had ever been before.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\14: _Journal de Physique_, 1782, p. 370.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION AND CORRECTION OF THE OXYGEN THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE a chemical theory, as far as it is true, must enable us to\r\nobtain a true view of the intimate composition of all bodies\r\nwhatever, it will readily be supposed that the new chemistry led to\r\nan immense number of analyses and researches of various kinds. These\r\nit is not necessary to dwell upon; nor will I even mention the names\r\nof any of the intelligent and diligent men who have labored in this\r\nfield. Perhaps one of the most striking of such analyses was Davy's\r\ndecomposition of the earths and alkalies into metallic bases and\r\noxygen, in 1807 and 1808; thus extending still further that analogy\r\nbetween the earths and the calces of the metals, which had had so\r\nlarge a share in the formation of chemical theories. This discovery,\r\nhowever, both in the means by which it was made, and in the views to\r\nwhich it led, bears upon subjects hereafter to be treated of.\r\n\r\nThe Lavoisierian theory also, wide as was the range of truth which\r\nit embraced, required some limitation and correction. I do not now\r\n{283} speak of some erroneous opinions entertained by the author of\r\nthe theory; as, for instance, that the heat produced in combustion,\r\nand even in respiration, arose from the conversion of oxygen gas to\r\na solid consistence, according to the doctrine of latent heat. Such\r\nopinions not being necessarily connected with the general idea of\r\nthe theory, need not here be considered. But the leading\r\ngeneralization of Lavoisier, that acidification was _always_\r\ncombination with oxygen, was found untenable. The point on which the\r\ncontest on this subject took place was the constitution of the\r\n_oxymuriatic_ and _muriatic_ acids;--as they had been termed by\r\nBerthollet, from the belief that muriatic acid contained oxygen, and\r\noxymuriatic a still larger dose of oxygen. In opposition to this, a\r\nnew doctrine was put forward in 1809 by Gay-Lussac and Thenard in\r\nFrance, and by Davy in England;--namely, that oxymuriatic acid was a\r\nsimple substance, which they termed _chlorine_, and that muriatic\r\nacid was a combination of chlorine with hydrogen, which therefore\r\nwas called _hydrochloric acid_. It may be observed, that the point\r\nin dispute in the controversy on this subject was nearly the same\r\nwhich had been debated in the course of the establishment of the\r\noxygen theory; namely, whether in the formation of muriatic acid\r\nfrom chlorine, oxygen is subtracted, or hydrogen added, and the\r\nwater concealed.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this dispute, it was allowed on both sides, that\r\nthe combination of dry muriatic acid and ammonia afforded an\r\n_experimentum crucis_; since, if water was produced from these\r\nelements, oxygen must have existed in the acid. Davy being at\r\nEdinburgh in 1812, this experiment was made in the presence of\r\nseveral eminent philosophers; and the result was found to be, that\r\nthough a slight dew appeared in the vessel, there was not more than\r\nmight be ascribed to unavoidable imperfection in the process, and\r\ncertainly not so much as the old theory of muriatic acid required.\r\nThe new theory, after this period, obtained a clear superiority in\r\nthe minds of philosophical chemists, and was further supported by\r\nnew analogies.[42\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\14: Paris, _Life of Davy_, i. 337.]\r\n\r\nFor, the existence of one _hydracid_ being thus established, it was\r\nfound that other substances gave similar combinations; and thus\r\nchemists obtained the _hydriodic_, _hydrofluoric_, and _hydrobromic_\r\nacids. These acids, it is to be observed, form salts with bases, in\r\nthe same manner as the oxygen acids do. The analogy of the muriatic\r\nand fluoric compounds was first clearly urged by a philosopher who\r\nwas {284} not peculiarly engaged in chemical research, but who was\r\noften distinguished by his rapid and happy generalizations, M.\r\nAmpère. He supported this analogy by many ingenious and original\r\narguments, in letters written to Davy, while that chemist was\r\nengaged in his researches on fluor spar, as Davy himself\r\ndeclares.[43\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\14: Paris, _Life of Davy_, i. 370.]\r\n\r\nStill further changes have been proposed, in that classification of\r\nelementary substances to which the oxygen theory led. It has been\r\nheld by Berzelius and others, that other elements, as, for example,\r\nsulphur, form _salts_ with the alkaline and earthy metals, rather\r\nthan sulphurets. The character of these _sulpho-salts_, however, is\r\nstill questioned among chemists; and therefore it does not become us\r\nto speak as if their place in history were settled. Of course, it\r\nwill easily be understood that, in the same manner in which the\r\noxygen theory introduced its own proper nomenclature, the overthrow\r\nor material transformation of the theory would require a change in\r\nthe nomenclature; or rather, the anomalies which tended to disturb\r\nthe theory, would, as they were detected, make the theoretical terms\r\nbe felt as inappropriate, and would suggest the necessity of a\r\nreformation in that respect. But the discussion of this point\r\nbelongs to a step of the science which is to come before us\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, that in approaching the limits of this part of\r\nour subject, as we are now doing, the doctrine of the combination of\r\n_acids_ and _bases_, of which we formerly traced the rise and\r\nprogress, is still assumed as a fundamental relation by which other\r\nrelations are tested. This remark connects the stage of chemistry\r\nnow under our notice with its earliest steps. But in order to point\r\nout the chemical bearing of the next subjects of our narrative, we\r\nmay further observe, that _metals_, _earths_, _salts_, are spoken of\r\nas known _classes_ of substances; and in like manner the\r\nnewly-discovered elements, which form the last trophies of\r\nchemistry, have been distributed into such classes according to\r\ntheir analogies; thus _potassium_, _sodium_, _barium_, have been\r\nasserted to be metals; _iodine_, _bromine_, _fluorine_, have been\r\narranged as analogical to _chlorine_. Yet there is something vague\r\nand indefinite in the boundaries of such classifications and\r\nanalogies; and it is precisely where this vagueness falls, that the\r\nscience is still obscure or doubtful. We are led, therefore, to see\r\nthe dependence of Chemistry upon Classification; and it is to\r\nSciences of Classification which we shall next proceed; as soon as\r\nwe have noticed the most general views {285} which have been given\r\nof chemical relations, namely, the views of the electro-chemists.\r\n\r\nBut before we do this, we must look back upon a law which obtains in\r\nthe combination of elements, and which we have hitherto not stated;\r\nalthough it appears, more than any other, to reveal to us the\r\nintimate constitution of bodies, and to offer a basis for future\r\ngeneralizations. I speak of the _Atomic Theory_, as it is usually\r\ntermed; or, as we might rather call it, the Doctrine of Definite,\r\nReciprocal, and Multiple Proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF DEFINITE, RECIPROCAL, AND MULTIPLE PROPORTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Prelude to the Atomic Theory, and its Publication by\r\nDalton._\r\n\r\nTHE general laws of chemical combination announced by Mr. Dalton are\r\ntruths of the highest importance in the science, and are now nowhere\r\ncontested; but the view of matter as constituted of _atoms_, which\r\nhe has employed in conveying those laws, and in expressing his\r\nopinion of their cause, is neither so important nor so certain. In\r\nthe place which I here assign to his discovery, as one of the great\r\nevents of the history of chemistry, I speak only of the _law of\r\nphenomena_, the rules which govern the quantities in which elements\r\ncombine.\r\n\r\nThis law may be considered as consisting of three parts, according\r\nto the above description of it;--that elements combine in _definite_\r\nproportions;--that these determining proportions operate\r\n_reciprocally_;--and that when, between the same elements, several\r\ncombining proportions occur, they are related as _multiples_.\r\n\r\nThat elements combine in certain definite proportions of quantity,\r\nand in no other, was implied, as soon as it was supposed that\r\nchemical compounds had any definite properties. Those who first\r\nattempted to establish regular formulæ[44\\14] for the constitution\r\nof salts, minerals, and {286} other compounds, assumed, as the basis\r\nof this process, that the elements in different specimens had the\r\nsame proportion. Wenzel, in 1777, published his _Lehre von der\r\nVerwandschaft der Körper_; or, _Doctrine of the Affinities of\r\nBodies_; in which he gave many good and accurate analyses. His work,\r\nit is said, never grew into general notice. Berthollet, as we have\r\nalready stated, maintained that chemical compounds were not\r\ndefinite; but this controversy took place at a later period. It\r\nended in the establishment of the doctrine, that there is, for each\r\ncombination, only one proportion of the elements, or at most only\r\ntwo or three.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\14: Thomson, _Hist. Chem._ vol. ii. p. 279.]\r\n\r\nNot only did Wenzel, by his very attempt, presume the first law of\r\nchemical composition, the definiteness of the proportions, but he\r\nwas also led, by his results, to the second rule, that they are\r\nreciprocal. For he found that when two _neutral_ salts decompose\r\neach other, the resulting salts are also neutral. The neutral\r\ncharacter of the salts shows that they are definite compounds; and\r\nwhen the two elements of the one salt, _P_ and _s_, are presented to\r\nthose of the other, _B_ and _n_, if _P_ be in such quantity as to\r\ncombine definitely with _n_, _B_ will also combine definitely with\r\n_s_.[45\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\14: I am told that Wenzel (whose book I have not seen),\r\nthough he adduces many cases in which double decomposition gives\r\nneutral salts, does not express the proposition in a general form,\r\nnor use letters in expressing it.]\r\n\r\nViews similar to those of Wenzel were also published by Jeremiah\r\nBenjamin Richter[46\\14] in 1792, in his _Anfangsgründe der\r\nStöchyometrie, oder Messkunst Chymischer Elemente_, (_Principles of\r\nthe Measure of Chemical Elements_) in which he took the law, just\r\nstated, of reciprocal proportions, as the basis of his researches,\r\nand determined the numerical quantities of the common bases and\r\nacids which would saturate each other. It is clear that, by these\r\nsteps, the two first of our three rules may be considered as fully\r\ndeveloped. The change of general views which was at this time going\r\non, probably prevented chemists from feeling so much interest as\r\nthey might have done otherwise, in these details; the French and\r\nEnglish chemists, in particular, were fully employed with their own\r\nresearches and controversies.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\14: Thomson, _Hist. Chem._ vol. ii. p. 283.]\r\n\r\nThus the rules which had already been published by Wenzel and\r\nRichter had attracted so little notice, that we can hardly consider\r\nMr. Dalton as having been anticipated by those writers, when, in\r\n1803, he began to communicate his views on the chemical constitution\r\nof {287} bodies; these views being such as to include both these two\r\nrules in their most general form, and further, the rule, at that\r\ntime still more new to chemists, of _multiple_ proportions. He\r\nconceived bodies as composed of atoms of their constituent elements,\r\ngrouped, either one and one, or one and two, or one and three, and\r\nso on. Thus, if _C_ represent an atom of carbon and _O_ one of\r\noxygen, _O C_ will be an atom of _carbonic oxide_, and _O C O_ an\r\natom of _carbonic acid_; and hence it follows, that while both these\r\nbodies have a definite quantity of oxygen to a given quantity of\r\ncarbon, in the latter substance this quantity is _double_ of what it\r\nis in the former.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of bodies as consisting of compound atoms, each of\r\nthese being composed of elementary atoms, naturally led to this law\r\nof multiple proportions. In this mode of viewing bodies, Mr. Dalton\r\nhad been preceded (unknown to himself) by Mr. Higgins, who, in 1789,\r\npublished[47\\14] his _Comparative View of the Phlogistic and\r\nAntiphlogistic Theories_. He there says,[48\\14] \"That in volatile\r\nvitriolic acid, a single ultimate particle of sulphur is united only\r\nto a single particle of dephlogisticated air; and that in perfect\r\nvitriolic acid, every single particle of sulphur is united to two of\r\ndephlogisticated air, being the quantity necessary to saturation;\"\r\nand he reasons in the same manner concerning the constitution of\r\nwater, and the compounds of nitrogen and oxygen. These observations\r\nof Higgins were, however, made casually, and not followed out, and\r\ncannot affect Dalton's claim to original merit.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\14: Turner's _Chem._ p. 217.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\14: P. 36 and 37.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dalton's generalization was first suggested[49\\14] during his\r\nexamination of olefiant gas and carburetted hydrogen gas; and was\r\nasserted generally, on the strength of a few facts, being, as it\r\nwere, irresistibly recommended by the clearness and simplicity which\r\nthe notion possessed. Mr. Dalton himself represented the compound\r\natoms of bodies by symbols, which professed to exhibit the\r\narrangement of the elementary atoms in space as well as their\r\nnumerical proportion; and he attached great importance to this part\r\nof his scheme. It is clear, however, that this part of his doctrine\r\nis not essential to that numerical comparison of the law with facts,\r\non which its establishment rests. These hypothetical configurations\r\nof atoms have no value till they are confirmed by corresponding\r\nfacts, such as the optical or crystalline properties of bodies may\r\nperhaps one day furnish. {288}\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\14: Thomson, vol. ii. p. 291.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Reception and Confirmation of the Atomic Theory._\r\n\r\nIN order to give a sketch of the progress of the Atomic Theory into\r\ngeneral reception, we cannot do better than borrow our information\r\nmainly from Dr. Thomson, who was one of the earliest converts and\r\nmost effective promulgators of the doctrine. Mr. Dalton, at the time\r\nwhen he conceived his theory, was a teacher of mathematics at\r\nManchester, in circumstances which might have been considered\r\nnarrow, if he himself had been less simple in his manner of life,\r\nand less moderate in his worldly views. His experiments were\r\ngenerally made with apparatus of which the simplicity and cheapness\r\ncorresponded to the rest of his habits. In 1804, he was already in\r\npossession of his atomic theory, and explained it to Dr. Thomson,\r\nwho visited him at that time. It was made known to the chemical\r\nworld in Dr. Thomson's _Chemistry_, in 1807; and in Dalton's own\r\n_System of Chemistry_ (1808) the leading ideas of it were very\r\nbriefly stated. Dr. Wollaston's memoir, \"on superacid and subacid\r\nsalts,\" which appeared in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1808,\r\ndid much to secure this theory a place in the estimation of\r\nchemists. Here the author states, that he had observed, in various\r\nsalts, the quantities of acid combined with the base in the neutral\r\nand in the superacid salts to be as one to two: and he says that,\r\nthinking it likely this law might obtain generally in such\r\ncompounds, it was his design to have pursued this subject, with the\r\nhope of discovering the cause to which so regular a relation may be\r\nascribed. But he adds, that this appears to be superfluous after the\r\npublication of Dalton's theory by Dr. Thomson, since all such facts\r\nare but special cases of the general law. We cannot but remark here,\r\nthat the scrupulous timidity of Wollaston was probably the only\r\nimpediment to his anticipating Dalton in the publication of the rule\r\nof multiple proportions; and the forwardness to generalize, which\r\nbelongs to the character of the latter, justly secured him, in this\r\ninstance, the name of the discoverer of this law. The rest of the\r\nEnglish chemists soon followed Wollaston and Thomson, though Davy\r\nfor some time resisted. They objected, indeed, to Dalton's\r\nassumption of atoms, and, to avoid this hypothetical step, Wollaston\r\nused the phrase _chemical equivalents_, and Davy the word\r\n_proportions_, for the numbers which expressed Dalton's atomic\r\nweights. We may, however, venture to say that the term \"atom\" is the\r\nmost convenient, and it need not be understood as claiming our\r\nassent to the hypothesis of indivisible molecules. {289}\r\n\r\nAs Wollaston and Dalton were thus arriving independently at the same\r\nresult in England, other chemists, in other countries, were, unknown\r\nto each other, travelling towards the same point.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, Berzelius,[50\\14] intending to publish a system of\r\nchemistry, went through several works little read, and among others\r\nthe treatises of Richter. He was astonished, he tells us, at the\r\nlight which was there thrown upon composition and decomposition, and\r\nwhich had never been turned to profit. He was led to a long train of\r\nexperimental research, and, when he received information of Dalton's\r\nideas concerning multiple proportions, he found, in his own\r\ncollection of analyses, a full confirmation of this theory.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\14: Berz. _Chem._ B. iii. p. 27.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Germans, indeed, appear discontented with the partition\r\nof reputation which has taken place with respect to the Theory of\r\nDefinite Proportions. One[51\\14] of them says, \"Dalton has only done\r\nthis;--he has wrapt up the good Richter (whom he knew; compare\r\nSchweigger, T, older series, vol. x., p. 381;) in a ragged suit,\r\npatched together of atoms; and now poor Richter comes back to his\r\nown country in such a garb, like Ulysses, and is not recognized.\" It\r\nis to be recollected, however, that Richter says nothing of multiple\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\14: Marx. _Gesch. der Cryst._ p. 202.]\r\n\r\nThe general doctrine of the atomic theory is now firmly established\r\nover the whole of the chemical world. There remain still several\r\ncontroverted points, as, for instance, whether the atomic weights of\r\nall elements are exact multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen.\r\nDr. Prout advanced several instances in which this appeared to be\r\ntrue, and Dr. Thomson has asserted the law to be of universal\r\napplication. But, on the other hand, Berzelius and Dr. Turner\r\ndeclare that this hypothesis is at variance with the results of the\r\nbest analyses. Such controverted points do not belong to our\r\nhistory, which treats only of the progress of scientific truths\r\nalready recognized by all competent judges.\r\n\r\nThough Dalton's discovery was soon generally employed, and\r\nuniversally spoken of with admiration, it did not bring to him\r\nanything but barren praise, and he continued in the humble\r\nemployment of which we have spoken, when his fame had filled Europe,\r\nand his name become a household word in the laboratory. After some\r\nyears he was appointed a corresponding member of the Institute of\r\nFrance; which may be considered as a European recognition of the\r\nimportance {290} of what he had done; and, in 1826, two medals for\r\nthe encouragement of science having been placed at the disposal of\r\nthe Royal Society by the King of England, one of them was assigned\r\nto Dalton, \"for his development of the atomic theory.\" In 1833, at\r\nthe meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, which was held in Cambridge, it was announced that the King\r\nhad bestowed upon him a pension of 150_l._; at the preceding meeting\r\nat Oxford, that university had conferred upon him the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws, a step the more remarkable, since he belonged to the\r\nsect of Quakers. At all the meetings of the British Association he\r\nhas been present, and has always been surrounded by the reverence\r\nand admiration of all who feel any sympathy with the progress of\r\nscience. May he long remain among us thus to remind us of the vast\r\nadvance which Chemistry owes to him!\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Soon after I wrote these expressions of hope, the period\r\nof Dalton's sojourn among us terminated. He died on the 27th of\r\nJuly, 1844, aged 78.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-townsmen, the inhabitants of Manchester, who had so long\r\ntaken a pride in his residence among them, soon after his death came\r\nto a determination to perpetuate his memory by establishing in his\r\nhonor a Professor of Chemistry at Manchester.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_The Theory of Volumes.--Gay-Lussac._\r\n\r\nTHE atomic theory, at the very epoch of its introduction into\r\nFrance, received a modification in virtue of a curious discovery\r\nthen made. Soon after the publication of Dalton's system, Gay-Lussac\r\nand Humboldt found a rule for the combination of substances, which\r\nincludes that of Dalton as far as it goes, but extends to\r\ncombinations of gases only. This law is the _theory of volumes_;\r\nnamely, that gases unite together _by volume_ in very simple and\r\ndefinite proportions. Thus water is composed exactly of 100 measures\r\nof oxygen and 200 measures of hydrogen. And since these simple\r\nratios 1 and 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, alone prevail in such\r\ncombinations, it may easily be shown that laws like Dalton's law of\r\nmultiple proportions, must obtain in such cases as he considered.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [M. Schröder, of Mannheim, has endeavored to extend to\r\nsolids a law in some degree resembling Gay-Lussac's law of the\r\nvolumes of gases. According to him, the volumes of the chemical\r\nequivalents {291} of simple substances and their compounds are as\r\nwhole numbers.[52\\14] MM. Kopp, Playfair, and Joule have labored in\r\nthe same field.]\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\14: _Die molecular-volume der Chemischen Verbindungen in\r\nfesten und flüssingen Zustande_, 1843.]\r\n\r\nI cannot now attempt to trace other bearings and developments of\r\nthis remarkable discovery. I hasten on to the last generalization of\r\nchemistry; which presents to us chemical forces under a new aspect,\r\nand brings us back to the point from which we departed in commencing\r\nthe history of this science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEPOCH OF DAVY AND FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Promulgation of the Electro-chemical Theory by Davy._\r\n\r\nTHE reader will recollect that the History of Chemistry, though\r\nhighly important and instructive in itself, has been an interruption\r\nof the History of Electro-dynamic Research:--a necessary\r\ninterruption, however; for till we became acquainted with Chemistry\r\nin general, we could not follow the course of Electro-chemistry: we\r\ncould not estimate its vast yet philosophical theories, nor even\r\nexpress its simplest facts. We have now to endeavor to show what has\r\nthus been done, and by what steps;--to give a fitting view of the\r\nEpoch of Davy and Faraday.\r\n\r\nThis is, doubtless, a task of difficulty and delicacy. We cannot\r\nexecute it at all, except we suppose that the great truths, of which\r\nthe discovery marks this epoch, have already assumed their definite\r\nand permanent form. For we do not learn the just value and right\r\nplace of imperfect attempts and partial advances in science, except\r\nby seeing to what they lead. We judge properly of our trials and\r\nguesses only when we have gained our point and guessed rightly. We\r\nmight personify philosophical theories, and might represent them to\r\nourselves as figures, all pressing eagerly onwards in the same {292}\r\ndirection, whom we have to pursue: and it is only in proportion as\r\nwe ourselves overtake those figures in the race, and pass beyond\r\nthem, that we are enabled to look back upon their faces; to discern\r\ntheir real aspects, and to catch the true character of their\r\ncountenances. Except, therefore, I were of opinion that the great\r\ntruths which Davy brought into sight have been firmly established\r\nand clearly developed by Faraday, I could not pretend to give the\r\nhistory of this striking portion of science. But I trust, by the\r\nview I have to offer of these beautiful trains of research and their\r\nresult, to justify the assumption on which I thus proceed.\r\n\r\nI must, however, state, as a further appeal to the reader's\r\nindulgence, that, even if the great principles of electro-chemistry\r\nhave now been brought out in their due form and extent, the\r\ndiscovery is but a very few years, I might rather say a few months,\r\nold, and that this novelty adds materially to the difficulty of\r\nestimating previous attempts from the point of view to which we are\r\nthus led. It is only slowly and by degrees that the mind becomes\r\nsufficiently imbued with those new truths, of which the office is,\r\nto change the face of a science. We have to consider familiar\r\nappearances under a new aspect; to refer old facts to new\r\nprinciples; and it is not till after some time, that the struggle\r\nand hesitation which this employment occasions, subsides into a\r\ntranquil equilibrium. In the newly acquired provinces of man's\r\nintellectual empire, the din and confusion of conquest pass only\r\ngradually into quiet and security. We have seen, in the history of\r\nall capital discoveries, how hardly they have made their way, even\r\namong the most intelligent and candid philosophers of the antecedent\r\nschools: we must, therefore, not expect that the metamorphosis of\r\nthe theoretical views of chemistry which is now going on, will be\r\neffected without some trouble and delay.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavor to diminish the difficulties of my undertaking, by\r\npresenting the earlier investigations in the department of which I\r\nhave now to speak, as much as possible according to the most\r\ndeliberate view taken of them by the great discoverers themselves,\r\nDavy and Faraday; since these philosophers are they who have taught\r\nus the true import of such investigations.\r\n\r\nThere is a further difficulty in my task, to which I might\r\nrefer;--the difficulty of speaking, without error and without\r\noffence, of men now alive, or who were lately members of social\r\ncircles which exist still around us. But the scientific history in\r\nwhich such persons play a part, is so important to my purpose, that\r\nI do not hesitate to incur {293} the responsibility which the\r\nnarration involves; and I have endeavored earnestly, and I hope not\r\nin vain, to speak as if I were removed by centuries from the\r\npersonages of my story.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena observed in the Voltaic apparatus were naturally the\r\nsubject of many speculations as to their cause, and thus gave rise\r\nto \"Theories of the Pile.\" Among these phenomena there was one class\r\nwhich led to most important results: it was discovered by Nicholson\r\nand Carlisle, in 1800, that water was _decomposed_ by the pile of\r\nVolta; that is, it was found that when the wires of the pile were\r\nplaced with their ends near each other in the fluid, a stream of\r\nbubbles of air arose from each wire, and these airs were found on\r\nexamination to be oxygen and hydrogen: which, as we have had to\r\nnarrate, had already been found to be the constituents of water.\r\nThis was, as Davy says,[53\\14] the true origin of all that has been\r\ndone in electro-chemical science. It was found that other substances\r\nalso suffered a like decomposition under the same circumstances.\r\nCertain metallic solutions were decomposed, and an alkali was\r\nseparated on the negative plates of the apparatus. Cruickshank, in\r\npursuing these experiments, added to them many important new\r\nresults; such as the decomposition of muriates of magnesia, soda,\r\nand ammonia by the pile; and the general observation that the\r\nalkaline matter always appeared at the _negative_, and the acid at\r\nthe _positive_, pole.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1826, p. 386.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the subject when one who was destined to do so\r\nmuch for its advance, first contributed his labors to it. Humphry\r\nDavy was a young man who had been apprenticed to a surgeon at\r\nPenzance, and having shown an ardent love and a strong aptitude for\r\nchemical research, was, in 1798, made the superintendent of a\r\n\"Pneumatic Institution,\" established at Bristol by Dr. Beddoes, for\r\nthe purpose of discovering medical powers of factitious airs.[54\\14]\r\nBut his main attention was soon drawn to galvanism; and when, in\r\nconsequence of the reputation he had acquired, he was, in 1801,\r\nappointed lecturer at the Royal Institution in London (then recently\r\nestablished), he was soon put in possession of a galvanic apparatus\r\nof great power; and with this he was not long in obtaining the most\r\nstriking results.\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\14: Paris, _Life of Davy_, i. 58.]\r\n\r\nHis first paper on the subject[55\\14] is sent from Bristol, in\r\nSeptember, 1800; and describes experiments, in which he had found\r\nthat the decompositions observed by Nicholson and Carlisle go on,\r\nalthough the {294} water, or other substance in which the two wires\r\nare plunged, be separated into two portions, provided these portions\r\nare connected by muscular or other fibres. This use of muscular\r\nfibres was, probably, a remnant of the original disposition, or\r\naccident, by which galvanism had been connected with physiology, as\r\nmuch as with chemistry. Davy, however, soon went on towards the\r\nconclusion, that the phenomena were altogether chemical in their\r\nnature. He had already conjectured,[56\\14] in 1802, that all\r\ndecompositions might be _polar_; that is, that in all cases of\r\nchemical decomposition, the elements might be related to each other\r\nas electrically _positive_ and _negative_; a thought which it was\r\nthe peculiar glory of his school to confirm and place in a distinct\r\nlight. At this period such a view was far from obvious; and it was\r\ncontended by many, on the contrary, that the elements which the\r\nvoltaic apparatus brought to view, were not liberated from\r\ncombinations, but generated. In 1806, Davy attempted the solution of\r\nthis question; he showed that the ingredients which had been\r\nsupposed to be produced by electricity, were due to impurities in\r\nthe water, or to the decomposition of the vessel; and thus removed\r\nall preliminary difficulties. And then he says,[57\\14] \"referring to\r\nmy experiments of 1800, 1801, and 1802, and to a number of new\r\nfacts, which showed that inflammable substances and oxygen, alkalies\r\nand acids, and oxidable and noble metals, were in electrical\r\nrelations of positive and negative, I drew the conclusion, _that the\r\ncombinations and decompositions by electricity were referrible to\r\nthe law of electrical attractions and repulsions_,\" and advanced the\r\nhypothesis, \"_that chemical and electrical attractions were produced\r\nby the same cause, acting in the one case on particles, in the other\r\non masses; . . . and that the same property, under different\r\nmodifications, was the cause of all the phenomena exhibited by\r\ndifferent voltaic combinations._\"\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\14: Nicholson's _Journal_, 4to. iv. 275.]\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1826.]\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\14: Ib. 1826, p. 389.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this is the enunciation, in tolerably precise terms, of the\r\ngreat discovery of his epoch, it was, at the period of which we\r\nspeak, conjectured rather than proved; and we shall find that\r\nneither Davy nor his followers, for a considerable period,\r\napprehended it with that distinctness which makes a discovery\r\ncomplete. But in a very short time afterwards, Davy drew great\r\nadditional notice to his researches by effecting, in pursuance, as\r\nit appeared, of his theoretical views, the decomposition of potassa\r\ninto a metallic base and oxygen. This was, as he truly said, in the\r\nmemorandum written in his journal at the {295} instant, \"a capital\r\nexperiment.\" This discovery was soon followed by that of the\r\ndecomposition of soda; and shortly after, of other bodies of the\r\nsame kind; and the interest and activity of the whole chemical world\r\nwere turned to the subject in an intense degree.\r\n\r\nAt this period, there might be noticed three great branches of\r\nspeculation on this subject; _the theory of the pile_, _the theory\r\nof electrical decomposition_, and **_the theory of the identity of\r\nchemical and electrical forces_; which last doctrine, however, was\r\nfound to include the other two, as might have been anticipated from\r\nthe time of its first suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to say much on the theories of the voltaic\r\npile, as separate from other parts of the subject. The\r\n_contact-theory_, which ascribed the action to the contact of\r\ndifferent metals, was maintained by Volta himself; but gradually\r\ndisappeared, as it was proved (by Wollaston[58\\14] especially,) that\r\nthe effect of the pile was inseparably connected with oxidation or\r\nother chemical changes. The theories of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition were numerous, and especially after the promulgation\r\nof Davy's _Memoir_ in 1806; and, whatever might be the defects under\r\nwhich these speculations for a long time labored, the subject was\r\npowerfully urged on in the direction in which truth lay, by Davy's\r\ndiscoveries and views. That there remained something still to be\r\ndone, in order to give full evidence and consistency to the theory,\r\nappears from this;--that some of the most important parts of Davy's\r\nresults struck his followers as extraordinary paradoxes;--for\r\ninstance, the fact that the decomposed elements are transferred from\r\none part of the circuit to another, in a form which escapes the\r\ncognizance of our senses, through intervening substances for which\r\nthey have a strong affinity. It was found afterwards that the\r\ncircumstance which appeared to make the process so wonderful, was,\r\nin fact, the condition of its going on at all. Davy's expressions\r\noften seem to indicate the most exact notions: for instance, he\r\nsays, \"It is very natural to suppose that the repellent and\r\nattractive energies are communicated from one particle to another of\r\nthe same kind, so as to establish a conducting _chain_ in the fluid;\r\nand that the locomotion takes place in consequence;\"[59\\14] and yet\r\nat other times he speaks of the element as _attracted_ and\r\n_repelled_ by the metallic surfaces which form the _poles_;--a\r\ndifferent, and, as it appeared afterwards, an untenable view. Mr.\r\nFaraday, who supplied what was wanting, justly notices this\r\nvagueness. {296} He says,[60\\14] that though, in Davy's celebrated\r\nMemoir of 1806, the points established are of the utmost value, the\r\nmode of action by which the effects take place is stated very\r\ngenerally; so generally, indeed, that probably a dozen precise\r\nschemes of electro-chemical action might be drawn up, differing\r\nessentially from each other, yet all agreeing with the statement\r\nthere given.\" And at a period a little later, being reproached by\r\nDavy's brother with injustice in this expression, he substantiated\r\nhis assertion by an enumeration of twelve such schemes which had\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1801, p. 427.]\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\14: Paris, i. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\14: _Researches_, 482.]\r\n\r\nBut yet we cannot look upon this Memoir of 1806, otherwise than as a\r\ngreat event, perhaps the most important event of the epoch now under\r\nreview. And as such it was recognized at once all over Europe. In\r\nparticular, it received the distinguished honor of being crowned by\r\nthe Institute of France, although that country and England were then\r\nengaged in fierce hostility. Buonaparte had proposed a prize of\r\nsixty thousand francs \"to the person who by his experiments and\r\ndiscoveries should advance the knowledge of electricity and\r\ngalvanism, as much as Franklin and Volta did;\" and \"of three\r\nthousand francs for the best experiment which should be made in the\r\ncourse of each year on the galvanic fluid;\" the latter prize was, by\r\nthe First Class of the Institute, awarded to Davy.\r\n\r\nFrom this period he rose rapidly to honors and distinctions, and\r\nreached a height of scientific fame as great as has ever fallen to\r\nthe lot of a discoverer in so short a time. I shall not, however,\r\ndwell on such circumstances, but confine myself to the progress of\r\nmy subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Establishment of the Electro-chemical Theory by Faraday._\r\n\r\nTHE defects of Davy's theoretical views will be seen most clearly by\r\nexplaining what Faraday added to them. Michael Faraday was in every\r\nway fitted and led to become Davy's successor in his great career of\r\ndiscovery. In 1812, being then a bookseller's apprentice, he\r\nattended the lectures of Davy, which at that period excited the\r\nhighest admiration.[61\\14] \"My desire to escape from trade,\" Mr.\r\nFaraday says, \"which I thought vicious and selfish, and to enter\r\ninto the service of science, which I imagined made its pursuers\r\namiable and liberal, induced me at last to take the bold and simple\r\nstep of writing to Sir H. Davy.\" He was favorably received, and, in\r\nthe next year, became {297} Davy's assistant at the Institution; and\r\nafterwards his successor. The Institution which produced such\r\nresearches as those of these two men, may well be considered as a\r\ngreat school of exact and philosophical chemistry. Mr. Faraday, from\r\nthe beginning of his course of inquiry, appears to have had the\r\nconsciousness that he was engaged on a great connected work. His\r\n_Experimental Researches_, which appeared in a series of Memoirs in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_, are divided into short paragraphs,\r\nnumbered into a continued order from 1 up to 1160, at the time at\r\nwhich I write;[62\\14] and destined, probably, to extend much\r\nfurther. These paragraphs are connected by a very rigorous method of\r\ninvestigation and reasoning which runs through the whole body of\r\nthem. Yet this unity of purpose was not at first obvious. His first\r\ntwo Memoirs were upon subjects which we have already treated of (B.\r\nxiii. c. 5 and c. 8), Voltaic Induction, and the evolution of\r\nElectricity from Magnetism. His \"Third Series\" has also been already\r\nreferred to. Its object was, as a preparatory step towards further\r\ninvestigation, to show the identity of voltaic and animal\r\nelectricity with that of the electrical machine; and as machine\r\nelectricity differs from other kinds in being successively in a\r\nstate of tension and explosion, instead of a continued current, Mr.\r\nFaraday succeeded in identifying it with them, by causing the\r\nelectrical discharge to pass through a bad conductor into a\r\ndischarging-train of vast extent; nothing less, indeed, than the\r\nwhole fabric of the metallic gas-pipes and water-pipes of London. In\r\nthis Memoir[63\\14] it is easy to see already traces of the general\r\ntheoretical views at which he had arrived; but these are not\r\nexpressly stated till his \"Fifth Series;\" his intermediate Fourth\r\nSeries being occupied by another subsidiary labor on the conditions\r\nof conduction. At length, however, in the Fifth Series, which was\r\nread to the Royal Society in June, 1833, he approaches the theory of\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition. Most preceding theorists, and Davy\r\namongst the number, had referred this result to _attractive powers_\r\nresiding in the _poles_ of the apparatus; and had even pretended to\r\ncompare the intensity of this attraction at different distances from\r\nthe poles. By a number of singularly beautiful and skilful\r\nexperiments, Mr. Faraday shows that the phenomena can with no\r\npropriety be {298} ascribed to the attraction of the poles.[64\\14]\r\n\"As the substances evolved in cases of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition may be made to appear against air,[65\\14] which,\r\naccording to common language, is not a conductor, nor is decomposed;\r\nor against water,[66\\14] which is a conductor, and can be\r\ndecomposed; as well as against the metal poles, which are excellent\r\nconductors, but undecomposable; there appears but little reason to\r\nconsider this phenomenon generally as due to the attraction or\r\nattractive powers of the latter, when used in the ordinary way,\r\nsince similar attractions can hardly be imagined in the former\r\ninstances.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\14: Paris, ii. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\14: December, 1835. (At present, when I am revising the\r\nsecond edition, September, 1846, Dr. Faraday has recently published\r\nthe \"Twenty-first Series\" of his _Researches_ ending with paragraph\r\n2453.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\14: _Phil. Trans._ 1833.]\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\14: _Researches_, Art. 497]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\14: _Researches_, Arts. 465, 469.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\14: 495.]\r\n\r\nFaraday's opinion, and, indeed, the only way of expressing the\r\nresults of his experiments, was, that the chemical elements, in\r\nobedience to the direction of the voltaic currents established in\r\nthe decomposing substance, were evolved, or, as he prefers to say,\r\n_ejected_ at its extremities.[67\\14] He afterwards states that the\r\ninfluence which is present in the electric current may be\r\ndescribed[68\\14] as _an axis of power, having_ [at each point]\r\n_contrary forces exactly equal in amount in contrary directions_.\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\14: 493.]\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\14: 517.]\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this point, Faraday rightly wished to reject the\r\nterm _poles_, and other words which could hardly be used without\r\nsuggesting doctrines now proved to be erroneous. He considered, in\r\nthe case of bodies electrically decomposed, or, as he termed them,\r\n_electrolytes_, the elements as travelling in two opposite\r\ndirections; which, with reference to the direction of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism, might be considered as naturally east and west; and he\r\nconceived elements as, in this way, arriving at the doors or outlets\r\nat which they finally made their separate appearance. The doors he\r\ncalled _electrodes_, and, separately, the _anode_ and the\r\n_cathode_;[69\\14] and the elements which thus travel he termed the\r\n_anïon_ and the _catïon_ (or _cathïon_).[70\\14] By means of this\r\nnomenclature he was able to express his general results with much\r\nmore distinctness and facility.\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\14: 663.]\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\14: The analogy of the Greek derivation requires _catïon_;\r\nbut to make the relation to _cathode_ obvious to the English reader,\r\nand to avoid a violation of the habits of English pronunciation, I\r\nshould prefer _cathïon_.]\r\n\r\nBut this general view of the electrolytical process required to be\r\npursued further, in order to explain the nature of the action. The\r\nidentity of electrical and chemical forces, which had been hazarded\r\nas {299} a conjecture by Davy, and adopted as the basis of chemistry\r\nby Berzelius, could only be established by exact measures and\r\nrigorous proofs. Faraday had, in his proof of the identity of\r\nvoltaic and electric agency, attempted also to devise such a measure\r\nas should give him a comparison of their quantity; and in this way\r\nhe proved that[71\\14] a voltaic group of two small wires of platinum\r\nand zinc, placed near each other, and immersed in dilute acid for\r\nthree seconds, yields as much electricity as the electrical battery,\r\ncharged by ten turns of a large machine; and this was established\r\nboth by its momentary electro-magnetic effect, and by the amount of\r\nits chemical action.[72\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\14: _Researches_, Art. 371.]\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\14: 537.]\r\n\r\nIt was in his \"Seventh Series,\" that he finally established a\r\nprinciple of definite measurement of the amount of electrolytical\r\naction, and described an instrument which he termed[73\\14] a\r\n_volta-electrometer_. In this instrument the amount of action was\r\nmeasured by the quantity of water decomposed: and it was necessary,\r\nin order to give validity to the mensuration, to show (as Faraday\r\ndid show) that neither the size of the electrodes, nor the intensity\r\nof the current, nor the strength of the acid solution which acted on\r\nthe plates of the pile, disturbed the accuracy of this measure. He\r\nproved, by experiments upon a great variety of substances, of the\r\nmost different kinds, that the electro-chemical action is definite\r\nin amount according to the measurement of the new instrument.[74\\14]\r\nHe had already, at an earlier period,[75\\14] asserted, that _the\r\nchemical power of a current of electricity is in direct proportion\r\nto the absolute quantity of electricity which passes_; but the\r\nvolta-electrometer enabled him to fix with more precision the\r\nmeaning of this general proposition, as well as to place it beyond\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\14: 739.]\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\14: Arts. 758, 814.]\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\14: 377.]\r\n\r\nThe vast importance of this step in chemistry soon came into view.\r\nBy the use of the volta-electrometer, Faraday obtained, for each\r\nelementary substance, a number which represented the relative amount\r\nof its decomposition, and which might properly[76\\14] be called its\r\n\"electro-chemical equivalent.\" And the question naturally occurs,\r\nwhether these numbers bore any relation to any previously\r\nestablished chemical measures. The answer is remarkable. _They were\r\nno other than the atomic weights of the Daltonian theory_, which\r\nformed the climax of the previous ascent of chemistry; and thus\r\nhere, as everywhere in {300} the progress of science, the\r\ngeneralizations of one generation are absorbed in the wider\r\ngeneralizations of the next.\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\14: 792.]\r\n\r\nBut in order to reach securely this wider generalization, Faraday\r\ncombined the two branches of the subject which we have already\r\nnoticed;--the _theory of electrical decomposition_ with the _theory\r\nof the pile_. For his researches on the origin of activity of the\r\nvoltaic circuit (his Eighth Series), led him to see more clearly\r\nthan any one before him, what, as we have said, the most sagacious\r\nof preceding philosophers had maintained, that the current in the\r\npile was due to the mutual chemical action of its elements. He was\r\nled to consider the processes which go on in the _exciting-cell_ and\r\nin the decomposing place as of the same kind, but opposite in\r\ndirection. The chemical _composition_ of the fluid with the zinc, in\r\nthe common apparatus, produces, when the circuit is completed, a\r\ncurrent of electric influence in the wire; and this current, if it\r\npass through an electrolyte, manifests itself by _decomposition_,\r\novercoming the chemical affinity which there resists it. An\r\nelectrolyte cannot conduct without being decomposed. The forces at\r\nthe point of composition and the point of decomposition are of the\r\nsame kind, and are opposed to each other by means of the\r\nconducting-wire; the wire may properly be spoken of[77\\14] as\r\n_conducting chemical affinity_: it allows two forces of the same\r\nkind to oppose one another;[78\\14] electricity is only another mode\r\nof the exertion of chemical forces;[79\\14] and we might express all\r\nthe circumstances of the voltaic pile without using any other term\r\nthan chemical affinity, though that of electricity may be very\r\nconvenient.[80\\14] Bodies are held together by a definite power,\r\nwhich, when it ceases to discharge that office, may be thrown into\r\nthe condition of an electric current.[81\\14]\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\14: Researches Art. 918.]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\14: 910.]\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\14: 915.]\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\14: 917.]\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\14: 855.]\r\n\r\nThus the great principle of the identity of electrical and chemical\r\naction was completely established. It was, as Faraday with great\r\ncandor says,[82\\14] a confirmation of the general views put forth by\r\nDavy, in 1806, and might be expressed in his terms, that \"chemical\r\nand electrical attractions are produced by the same cause;\" but it\r\nis easy to see that neither was the full import of these expressions\r\nunderstood nor were the quantities to which they refer conceived as\r\nmeasurable quantities, nor was the assertion anything but a\r\nsagacious conjecture, till Faraday gave the interpretation, measure,\r\nand proof, of which we have spoken. The evidence of the\r\nincompleteness of the views of his predecessor we have already\r\nadduced, in speaking of his vague and {301} inconsistent theoretical\r\naccount of decomposition. The confirmation of Davy's discoveries by\r\nFaraday is of the nature of Newton's confirmation of the views of\r\nBorelli and Hooke respecting gravity, or like Young's confirmation\r\nof the undulatory theory of Huyghens.\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\14: 965.]\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to repeat here the moral which we wish to draw from\r\nall great discoveries, that they depend upon the combination of\r\n_exact facts_ with _clear ideas_. The former of these conditions is\r\neasily illustrated in the case of Davy and Faraday, both admirable\r\nand delicate experimenters. Davy's rapidity and resource in\r\nexperimenting were extraordinary,[83\\14] and extreme elegance and\r\ningenuity distinguish almost every process of Faraday. He had\r\npublished, in 1829, a work on _Chemical Manipulation_, in which\r\ndirections are given for performing in the neatest manner all\r\nchemical processes. Manipulation, as he there truly says, is to the\r\nchemist like the external senses to the mind;[84\\14] and without the\r\nsupply of fit materials which such senses only can give, the mind\r\ncan acquire no real knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\14: Paris, i. 145.]\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\14: _Pref._ p. ii.]\r\n\r\nBut still the operations of the mind as well as the information of the\r\nsenses, ideas as well as facts, are requisite for the attainment of\r\nany knowledge; and all great steps in science require a peculiar\r\ndistinctness and vividness of thought in the discoverer. This it is\r\ndifficult to exemplify in any better way than by the discoveries\r\nthemselves. Both Davy and Faraday possessed this vividness of mind;\r\nand it was a consequence of this endowment, that Davy's **lectures\r\nupon chemistry, and Faraday's upon almost any subject of physical\r\nphilosophy, were of the most brilliant and captivating character. In\r\ndiscovering the nature of voltaic action, the essential intellectual\r\nrequisite was to have a distinct conception of that which Faraday\r\nexpressed by the remarkable phrase,[85\\14] \"_an axis of power having\r\nequal and opposite forces_;\" and the distinctness of this idea in\r\nFaraday's mind shines forth in every part of his writings. Thus he\r\nsays, the force which determines the decomposition of a body is _in_\r\nthe body, not in the poles.[86\\14] But for the most part he can of\r\ncourse only convey this fundamental idea by illustrations. Thus[87\\14]\r\nhe represents the voltaic circuit by a double circle, studded with the\r\nelements of the circuit, and shows how the _anïons_ travel round it in\r\none direction, and the _cathïons_ in the opposite. He considers[88\\14]\r\nthe powers at the two places of action as balancing against each other\r\nthrough the medium of the conductors, in a manner {302} analogous to\r\nthat in which mechanical forces are balanced against each other by the\r\nintervention of the lever. It is impossible to him[89\\14] to resist\r\nthe idea, that the voltaic current must be preceded by a state of\r\ntension in its interrupted condition, which is relieved when the\r\ncircuit is completed. He appears to possess the idea of this kind of\r\nforce with the same eminent distinctness with which Archimedes in the\r\nancient, and Stevinus in the modern history of science, possessed the\r\nidea of pressure, and were thus able to found the science of\r\nmechanics.[90\\14] And when he cannot obtain these distinct modes of\r\nconception, he is dissatisfied, and conscious of defect. Thus in the\r\nrelation between magnetism and electricity,[91\\14] \"there appears to\r\nbe a link in the chain of effects, a wheel in the physical mechanism\r\nof the action, as yet unrecognized.\" All this variety of expression\r\nshows how deeply seated is the thought. This conception of Chemical\r\nAffinity as a peculiar influence of force, which, acting in opposite\r\ndirections, combines and resolves bodies;--which may be liberated and\r\nthrown into the form of a voltaic current, and thus be transferred to\r\nremote points, and applied in various ways; is essential to the\r\nunderstanding, as it was to the making, of these discoveries.\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\14: Art. 517.]\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\14: Art. 661.]\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\14: **963.]\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\14: 917.]\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\14: Art. 950.]\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\14: 990.]\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\14: 1114.]\r\n\r\nBy those to whom this conception has been conveyed, I venture to\r\ntrust that I shall be held to have given a faithful account of this\r\nimportant event in the history of science. We may, before we quit\r\nthe subject, notice one or two of the remarkable subordinate\r\nfeatures of Faraday's discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Consequences of Faraday's Discoveries._\r\n\r\nFARADAY'S volta-electrometer, in conjunction with the method he had\r\nalready employed, as we have seen, for the comparison of voltaic and\r\ncommon electricity, enabled him to measure the actual quantity of\r\nelectricity which is exhibited, in given cases, in the form of\r\nchemical affinity. His results appeared in numbers of that enormous\r\namount which so often comes before us in the expression of natural\r\nlaws. One grain of water[92\\14] will require for its decomposition\r\nas much electricity as would make a powerful flash of lightning. By\r\nfurther calculation, he finds this quantity to be not less than\r\n800,000 charges of his Leyden battery;[93\\14] and this is, by his\r\ntheory of the identity of the combining with the decomposing force,\r\nthe quantity of electricity {303} which is naturally associated with\r\nthe elements of the grain of water, endowing them with their mutual\r\naffinity.\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\14: **853.]\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\14: 861.]\r\n\r\nMany of the subordinate facts and laws which were brought to light\r\nby these researches, clearly point to generalizations, not included\r\nin that which we have had to consider, and not yet discovered: such\r\nlaws do not properly belong to our main plan, which is to make our\r\nway _up to_ the generalizations. But there is one which so evidently\r\npromises to have an important bearing on future chemical theories,\r\nthat I will briefly mention it. The class of bodies which are\r\ncapable of electrical decomposition is limited by a very remarkable\r\nlaw: they are such binary compounds only as consist of _single_\r\nproportionals of their elementary principles. It does not belong to\r\nus here to speculate on the possible import of this curious law;\r\nwhich, if not fully established, Faraday has rendered, at least,\r\nhighly probable:[94\\14] but it is impossible not to see how closely\r\nit connects the Atomic with the Electro-chemical Theory; and in the\r\nconnexion of these two great members of Chemistry, is involved the\r\nprospect of its reaching wider generalizations, and principles more\r\nprofound than we have yet caught sight of.\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\14: Art. 697.]\r\n\r\nAs another example of this connexion, I will, finally, notice that\r\nFaraday has employed his discoveries in order to decide, in some\r\ndoubtful cases, what is the true chemical equivalent;[95\\14] \"I have\r\nsuch conviction,\" he says, \"that the power which governs\r\nelectro-decomposition and ordinary chemical attractions is the same;\r\nand such confidence in the overruling influence of those natural\r\nlaws which render the former definite, as to feel no hesitation in\r\nbelieving that the latter must submit to them too. Such being the\r\ncase, I can have no doubt that, assuming hydrogen as 1, and\r\ndismissing small fractions for the simplicity of expression, the\r\nequivalent number or atomic weight of oxygen is 8, of chlorine 36,\r\nof bromine 78·4, of lead 103·5, of tin 59, &c.; notwithstanding that\r\na very high authority doubles several of these numbers.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\14: 851.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Reception of the Electro-chemical Theory._\r\n\r\nTHE epoch of establishment of the electro-chemical theory, like\r\nother great scientific epochs, must have its sequel, the period of\r\nits reception and confirmation, application and extension. In that\r\nperiod we {304} are living, and it must be the task of future\r\nhistorians to trace its course.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, say a word on the reception which the theory met\r\nwith, in the forms which it assumed, anterior to the labors of\r\nFaraday. Even before the great discovery of Davy, Grotthuss, in\r\n1805, had written upon the theory of electro-chemical decomposition;\r\nbut he and, as we have seen, Davy, and afterwards other writers, as\r\nRiffault and Chompré, in 1807, referred the effects to the\r\npoles.[96\\14] But the most important attempt to appropriate and\r\nemploy the generalization which these discoveries suggested, was\r\nthat of Berzelius; who adopted at once the view of the identity, or\r\nat least the universal connexion, of electrical relations with\r\nchemical affinity. He considered,[97\\14] that in all chemical\r\ncombinations the elements may be considered as electro-positive and\r\nelectro-negative; and made this opposition the basis of his chemical\r\ndoctrines; in which he was followed by a large body of the chemists\r\nof Germany. He held too that the heat and light, evolved during\r\ncases of powerful combination, are the consequence of the electric\r\ndischarge which is at that moment taking place: a conjecture which\r\nFaraday at first spoke of with praise.[98\\14] But at a later period\r\nhe more sagely says,[99\\14] that the flame which is produced in such\r\ncases exhibits but a small portion of the electric power which\r\nreally acts. \"These therefore may not, cannot, be taken as evidences\r\nof the nature of the action; but are merely incidental results,\r\nincomparably small in relation to the forces concerned, and\r\nsupplying no information of the way in which the particles are\r\nactive on each other, or in which their forces are finally\r\narranged.\" And comparing the evidence which he himself had given of\r\nthe principle on which Berzelius's speculations rested, with the\r\nspeculations themselves, Faraday justly conceived, that he had\r\ntransferred the doctrine from the domain of what he calls _doubtful\r\nknowledge_, to that of inductive certainty.\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\14: Faraday (_Researches_, Art. 481, 492).]\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\14: _Ann. Chim._ lxxxvi. 146, for 1813.]\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\14: _Researches_, Art. 870]\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\14: 960.]\r\n\r\nNow that we are arrived at the starting-place, from which this\r\nwell-proved truth, the identity of electric and chemical forces,\r\nmust make its future advances, it would be trifling to dwell longer\r\non the details of the diffusion of that doubtful knowledge which\r\npreceded this more certain science. Our history of chemistry is,\r\ntherefore, here at an end. I have, as far as I could, executed my\r\ntask; which was, to mark all the {305} great steps of its advance,\r\nfrom the most unconnected facts and the most imperfect speculations,\r\nto the highest generalization at which chemical philosophers have\r\nyet arrived.\r\n\r\nYet it will appear to our purpose to say a few words on the\r\nconnexion of this science with those of which we are next to treat;\r\nand that I now proceed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTRANSITION FROM THE CHEMICAL TO THE CLASSIFICATORY SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is the object and the boast of chemistry to acquire a knowledge\r\nof bodies which is more exact and constant than any knowledge\r\nborrowed from their sensible qualities can be; since it penetrates\r\ninto their intimate constitution, and discloses to us the invariable\r\nlaws of their composition. But yet it will be seen, on a little\r\nreflection, that such knowledge could not have any existence, if we\r\nwere not also attentive to their sensible qualities.\r\n\r\nThe whole fabric of chemistry rests, even at the present day, upon\r\nthe opposition of acids and bases: an acid was certainly at first\r\nknown by its sensible qualities, and how otherwise, even now, do we\r\nperceive its quality? It was a great discovery of modern times that\r\nearths and alkalies have for their bases metals: but what are\r\n_metals_? or how, except from lustre, hardness, weight, and the\r\nlike, do we recognize a body as a metal? And how, except by such\r\ncharacters, even before its analysis, was it known to be an earth or\r\nan alkali? We must suppose some classification established, before\r\nwe can make any advance by experiment or observation.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that all attempts to avoid this difficulty by\r\nreferring to processes and analogies, as well as to substances,\r\nbring us back to the same point in a circle of fallacies. If we say\r\nthat an acid and alkali are known by combining with each other, we\r\nstill must ask, What is the criterion that they have _combined_? If\r\nwe say that the distinctive qualities of metals and earths are, that\r\nmetals become earths by oxidation, we must still inquire how we\r\nrecognize the process of _oxidation_? We have seen how important a\r\npart combustion plays in the history of chemical speculation; and we\r\nmay usefully form such classes of {306} bodies as _combustibles_ and\r\n_supporters of combustion_. But even _combustion_ is not capable of\r\nbeing infallibly known, for it passes by insensible shades into\r\noxidation. We can find no basis for our reasonings, which does not\r\nassume a classification of obvious facts and qualities.\r\n\r\nBut any classification of substances on such grounds, appears, at\r\nfirst sight, to involve us in vagueness, ambiguity, and\r\ncontradiction. Do we really take the sensible qualities of an acid\r\nas the criterion of its being an acid?--for instance, its sourness?\r\nPrussic acid, arsenious acid, are not sour. \"I remember,\" says Dr.\r\nParis,[100\\14] \"a chemist having been exposed to much ridicule from\r\nspeaking of a _sweet_ acid,--why not?\" When Davy had discovered\r\npotassium, it was disputed whether it was a metal; for though its\r\nlustre and texture are metallic, it is so light as to swim on water.\r\nAnd if potassium be allowed to be a metal, is silicium one, a body\r\nwhich wants the metallic lustre, and is a non-conductor of\r\nelectricity? It is clear that, at least, the _obvious_ application\r\nof a classification by physical characters, is attended with endless\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\14: _Life of Davy_, i. 263.]\r\n\r\nBut since we cannot even begin our researches without assuming a\r\nclassification, and since the forms of such a classification which\r\nfirst occur, end in apparent confusion, it is clear that we must\r\nlook to our philosophy for a solution of this difficulty; and must\r\navoid the embarrassments and contradictions of casual and\r\nunreflective classification, by obtaining a consistent and\r\nphilosophical arrangement. We must employ external characters and\r\nanalogies in a connected and systematic manner; we must have\r\n_Classificatory Sciences_, and these must have a bearing even on\r\nChemistry.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the most philosophical chemists now proceed upon this\r\nprinciple. \"The method which I have followed,\" says M. Thenard, in\r\nhis _Traité de Chimie_, published in 1824, \"is, to unite in one\r\ngroup all analogous bodies; and the advantage of this method, which\r\nis that employed by naturalists, is very great, especially in the\r\nstudy of the metals and their compounds.\"[101\\14] In this, as in all\r\ngood systems of chemistry, which have appeared since the\r\nestablishment of the phlogistic theory, combustion, and the\r\nanalogous processes, are one great element in the arrangement, while\r\nthe difference of metallic and non-metallic, is another element.\r\nThus Thenard, in the first place, speaks of Oxygen; in the next\r\nplace, of the Non-metallic Combustibles, as Hydrogen, Carbon,\r\nSulphur, Chlorine; and in the next place, of Metals. But the Metals\r\nare again divided into six Sections, with reference, {307}\r\nprincipally, to their facility of combination with oxygen. Thus, the\r\nFirst Section is the Metals of the Earths; the Second, the Metals of\r\nthe Alkalies; the Third, the Easily Oxidable Metals, as Iron; the\r\nFourth, Metals Less Oxidable, as Copper and Lead; the Fifth Section\r\ncontains only Mercury and Osmium; and the Sixth, what were at an\r\nearlier period termed the _Noble_ Metals, Gold, Silver, Platinum,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\14: Pref., p. viii.]\r\n\r\nHow such principles are to be applied, so as to produce a definite\r\nand consistent arrangement, will be explained in speaking of the\r\nphilosophy of the Classificatory Sciences; but there are one or two\r\npeculiarities in the classes of bodies thus recognized by modern\r\nchemistry, which it may be useful to notice.\r\n\r\n1. The distinction of Metallic and Non-metallic is still employed,\r\nas of fundamental importance. The discovery of new metals is so much\r\nconnected with the inquiries concerning chemical elements, that we\r\nmay notice the general progress of such discoveries. _Gold_,\r\n_Silver_, _Iron_, _Copper_, _Quicksilver_, _Lead_, _Tin_, were known\r\nfrom the earliest antiquity. In the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, mine-directors, like George Agricola, had advanced so far\r\nin practical metallurgy, that they had discovered the means of\r\nextracting three additional metals, _Zinc_, _Bismuth_, _Antimony_.\r\nAfter this, there was no new metal discovered for a century, and\r\nthen such discoveries were made by the theoretical chemists, a race\r\nof men who had not existed before Beccher and Stahl. Thus _Arsenic_\r\nand _Cobalt_ were made known by Brandt, in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, and we have a long list of similar discoveries\r\nbelonging to the same period; _Nickel_, _Manganese_, and _Tungsten_,\r\nwhich were detected by Cronstedt, Gahn, and Scheele, and Delhuyart,\r\nrespectively; metals of a very different kind, _Tellurium_ and\r\n_Molybdenum_, which were brought to light by Müller, Scheele,\r\nBergman, and Hielm; _Platinum_, which was known as early as 1741,\r\nbut with the ore of which, in 1802 and 1803, the English chemists,\r\nWollaston and Tennant, found that no less than four other new metals\r\n(_Palladium_, _Rhodium_, _Iridium_ and _Osmium_) were associated.\r\nFinally, (omitting some other new metals,) we have another period of\r\ndiscovery, opened in 1807, by Davy's discovery of _Potassium_, and\r\nincluding the resolution of all, or almost all, the alkalies and\r\nearths into metallic bases.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The next few years made some, at least some conjectural,\r\nadditions to the list of simple substances, detected by a more\r\nminute scrutiny of known substances. _Thorium_ was discovered by\r\nBerzelius in 1828; and _Vanadium_ by Professor Sefström in 1830. A\r\n{308} metal named _Cerium_, was discovered in 1803, by Hisinger and\r\nBerzelius, in a rare Swedish mineral known by the name of Cerit.\r\nMosander more recently has found combined with Cerium, other new\r\nmetals which he has called _Lanthanium_, _Didymium_, _Erbium_, and\r\n_Terbium_: M. Klaus has found a new metal, _Ruthenium_, in the ore\r\nof Platinum; and Rose has discovered in Tantalite two other new\r\nmetals, which he has announced under the names of _Pelopium_ and\r\n_Niobium_. Svanberg is said to have discovered a new earth in\r\nEudialyt, which is supposed to have, like the rest, a new radical.\r\nIf these last discoveries be confirmed, the number of simple\r\nsubstances will be raised to _sixty-two_.]\r\n\r\n2. Attempts have been made to indicate the classification of\r\nchemical substances by some peculiarity in the Name; and the Metals,\r\nfor example, have been designated generally by names in _um_, like\r\nthe Latin names of the ancient metals, _aurum_, _ferrum_. This\r\nartifice is a convenient nomenclature for the purpose of marking a\r\nrecognized difference; and it would be worth the while of chemists\r\nto agree to make it universal, by writing molybden_um_ and\r\nplatin_um_; which is sometimes done, but not always.\r\n\r\n3. I am not now to attempt to determine how far this\r\nclass,--Metals,--extends; but where the analogies of the class cease\r\nto hold there the nomenclature must also change. Thus, some\r\nchemists, as Dr. Thomson, have conceived that the base of Silica is\r\nmore analogous to Carbon and Boron, which form acids with oxygen,\r\nthan it is to the metals: and he has accordingly associated this\r\nbase with these substances, and has given it the same termination,\r\n_Silicon_. But on the validity of this analogy chemists appear not\r\nto be generally agreed.\r\n\r\n4. There is another class of bodies which have attracted much notice\r\namong modern chemists, and which have also been assimilated to each\r\nother in the form of their names; the English writers calling them\r\n_Chlorine_, _Fluorine_, _Iodine_, _Bromine_, while the French use\r\nthe terms _Chlore_, _Phtore_, _Iode_, _Brome_. We have already\r\nnoticed the establishment of the doctrine--that muriatic acid is\r\nformed of a base, chlorine, and of hydrogen,--as a great reform in\r\nthe oxygen theory; with regard to which rival claims were advanced\r\nby Davy, and by MM. Gay-Lussac and Thenard in 1800. Iodine, a\r\nremarkable body which, from a dark powder, is converted into a\r\nviolet-colored gas by the application of heat, was also, in 1813,\r\nthe subject of a similar rivalry between the same English and French\r\nchemists. Bromine {309} was only discovered as late as 1826; and\r\nFluorine, or _Phtore_, as, from its destructive nature, it has been\r\nproposed to term it, has not been obtained as a separate substance,\r\nand is inferred to exist by analogy only. The analogies of these\r\nbodies (Chlore, Phtore, &c.) are very peculiar; for instance, by\r\ncombination with metals they form salts; by combination with\r\nhydrogen they form very strong acids; and all, at the common\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere, operate on other bodies in the most\r\nenergetic manner. Berzelius[102\\14] proposes to call them\r\n_halogenous_ bodies, or _halogenes_.\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\14: _Chem._ i. 262.]\r\n\r\n5. The number of Elementary Substances which are at present\r\npresented in our treatises of chemistry[103\\14] is _fifty-three_, [or\r\nrather, as we have said above, _sixty-two_.] It is naturally often\r\nasked what evidence we have, that all these are _elementary_, and\r\nwhat evidence that they are _all_ the elementary bodies;--how we\r\nknow that new elements may not hereafter be discovered, or these\r\nsupposed simple bodies resolved into simpler still? To these\r\nquestions we can only answer, by referring to the history of\r\nchemistry;--by pointing out what chemists have understood by\r\nanalysis, according to the preceding narrative. They have\r\nconsidered, as the analysis of a substance, that elementary\r\nconstitution of it which gives the only intelligible explanation of\r\nthe results of chemical manipulation, and which is proved to be\r\ncomplete as to quantity, by the balance, since the whole can only be\r\nequal to all its parts. It is impossible to maintain that new\r\nsubstances may not hereafter be discovered; for they may lurk, even\r\nin familiar substances, in doses so minute that they have not yet\r\nbeen missed amid the inevitable slight inaccuracies of all analysis;\r\nin the way in which iodine and bromine remained so long undetected\r\nin sea-water; and new minerals, or old ones not yet sufficiently\r\nexamined, can hardly fail to add something to our list. As to the\r\npossibility of a further analysis of our supposed simple bodies, we\r\nmay venture to say that, in regard to such supposed simple bodies as\r\ncompose a numerous and well-characterized class, no such step can be\r\nmade, except through some great change in chemical theory, which\r\ngives us a new view of all the general relations which chemistry has\r\nyet discovered. The proper evidence of the reality of any supposed\r\nnew analysis is, that it is more consistent with the known analogies\r\nof chemistry, to suppose the process analytical than synthetical.\r\nThus, as has already been said, chemists admit the existence of\r\nfluorine, from the analogy of chlorine; and Davy, when it was found\r\n{310} that ammonia formed an amalgam with mercury, was tempted to\r\nassign to it a metallic basis. But then he again hesitates,[104\\14]\r\nand doubts whether the analogies of our knowledge are not better\r\npreserved by supposing that ammonia, as a compound of hydrogen and\r\nanother principle, is \"a type of the composition of the metals.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\14: Turner, p. 971.]\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\14: _Elem.

We have\r\nseen that the existence of Chemistry as a science which declares the\r\ningredients and essential constitution of all kinds of bodies,\r\nimplies the existence of another corresponding science, which shall\r\ndivide bodies into kinds, and point out steadily and precisely what\r\nbodies they are which we have analysed. But a science thus dividing\r\nand defining bodies, is but one member of an order of sciences,\r\ndifferent from those which we have hitherto described; namely, of\r\nthe _classificatory sciences_. Such sciences there must be, not only\r\nhaving reference to the bodies with which chemistry deals, but also\r\nto all things respecting which we aspire to obtain any general\r\nknowledge, as, for instance, plants and animals. Indeed it will be\r\nfound, that it is with regard to these latter objects, to organized\r\nbeings, that the process of scientific classification has been most\r\nsuccessfully exercised; while with regard to inorganic substances,\r\nthe formation of a satisfactory system of arrangement has been found\r\nextremely difficult; nor has the necessity of such a system been\r\nrecognised by chemists so distinctly and constantly as it ought to\r\nbe. The best exemplification of these branches of knowledge, of\r\nwhich we now have to speak, will, therefore, be found in the organic\r\nworld, in Botany and Zoology; but we will, in the first place, take\r\na brief view of the science which classifies inorganic bodies, and\r\nof which Mineralogy is hitherto the very imperfect representative.\r\n\r\nThe principles and rules of the Classificatory Sciences, as well as\r\nof those of the other orders of sciences, must be fully explained\r\nwhen we come to treat of the Philosophy of the Sciences; and cannot\r\nbe introduced here, where we have to do with history only. But I may\r\nobserve very briefly, that with the process of _classing_, is joined\r\nthe process of _naming_;--that names imply classification;--and that\r\neven the rudest and earliest application of language presupposes a\r\ndistribution of objects according to their kinds;--but that such a\r\nspontaneous {314} and unsystematic distribution cannot, in the cases\r\nwe now have to consider, answer the purposes of exact and general\r\nknowledge. Our classification of objects must be made consistent and\r\nsystematic, in order to be scientific; we must discover marks and\r\ncharacters, properties and conditions, which are constant in their\r\noccurrence and relations; we must form our classes, we must impose\r\nour names, according to such marks. We can thus, and thus alone,\r\narrive at that precise, certain, and systematic knowledge, which we\r\nseek; that is, at science. The object, then, of the classificatory\r\nsciences is to obtain FIXED CHARACTERS of the kinds of things; and\r\nthe criterion of the fitness of names is, that THEY MAKE GENERAL\r\nPROPOSITIONS POSSIBLE.\r\n\r\nI proceed to review the progress of certain sciences on these\r\nprinciples, and first, though briefly, the science of Mineralogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Mineralogy as the Analytico-classificatory Science._\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY, as it has hitherto been cultivated, is, as I have\r\nalready said, an imperfect representative of the department of human\r\nknowledge to which it belongs. The attempts at the science have\r\ngenerally been made by collecting various kinds of information\r\nrespecting mineral bodies; but the science which we require is a\r\ncomplete and consistent classified system of all inorganic bodies.\r\nFor chemistry proceeds upon the principle that the constitution of a\r\nbody invariably determines its properties; and, consequently, its\r\nkind: but we cannot apply this principle, except we can speak with\r\nprecision of the _kind_ of a body, as well as of its composition. We\r\ncannot attach any sense to the assertion, that \"soda or baryta has a\r\nmetal for its base,\" except we know what _a metal_ is, or at least\r\nwhat properties it implies. It may not be, indeed it is not,\r\npossible, to define the kinds of bodies by words only; but the\r\nclassification must proceed by some constant and generally\r\napplicable process; and the knowledge which has reference to the\r\nclassification will be precise as far as this process is precise,\r\nand vague as far as this is vague.\r\n\r\nThere must be, then, as a necessary supplement to Chemistry, a\r\nScience of those properties of bodies by which we divide them into\r\n_kinds_. Mineralogy is the branch of knowledge which has discharged\r\nthe office of such a science, so far as it has been discharged; and,\r\nindeed, Mineralogy has been gradually approaching to a clear\r\nconsciousness of her real place, and of her whole task; I shall give\r\nthe history of some of the advances which have thus been made. They\r\nare, principally, {315} the establishment and use of External\r\nCharacters, especially of _Crystalline Form_, as a fixed character\r\nof definite substances; and the attempts to bring into view the\r\nconnexion of Chemical Constitution and External Properties, made in\r\nthe shape of mineralogical _Systems_; both those in which _chemical\r\nmethods of arrangement_ are adopted, and those which profess to\r\nclassify by the _natural-history method_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{316}}\r\nCRYSTALLOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE EPOCH OF DE LISLE AND HAÜY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all the physical properties of bodies, there is none so fixed,\r\nand in every way so remarkable, as this;--that the same chemical\r\ncompound always assumes, with the utmost precision, the same\r\ngeometrical form. This identity, however, is not immediately\r\nobvious; it is often obscured by various mixtures and imperfections\r\nin the substance; and even when it is complete, it is not\r\nimmediately recognized by a common eye, since it consists, not in\r\nthe equality of the sides or faces of the figures, but in the\r\nequality of their angles. Hence it is not surprising that the\r\nconstancy of form was not detected by the early observers. Pliny\r\nsays,[1\\15] \"Why crystal is generated in a hexagonal form, it is\r\ndifficult to assign a reason; and the more so, since, while its\r\nfaces are smoother than any art can make them, the pyramidal points\r\nare _not all of the same kind_.\" The quartz crystals of the Alps, to\r\nwhich he refers, are, in some specimens, very regular, while in\r\nothers, one side of the pyramid becomes much the largest; yet the\r\nangles remain constantly the same. But when the whole shape varied\r\nso much, the angles also seemed to vary. Thus Conrad Gessner, a very\r\nlearned naturalist, who, in 1564, published at Zurich his work, _De\r\nrerum Fossilium, Lapidum et Gemmarum maxime, Figuris_, says,[2\\15]\r\n\"One crystal differs from another in its angles, and consequently in\r\nits figure.\" And Cæsalpinus, who, as we shall find, did so much in\r\nestablishing fixed characters in botany, was led by some of his\r\ngeneral views to disbelieve the fixity of the form of crystals. In\r\nhis work _De Metallicis_, published at Nuremberg in 1602, he\r\nsays,[3\\15] \"To ascribe to inanimate bodies a definite form, does\r\nnot appear consentaneous to reason; for it is the office of\r\norganization to produce a definite form;\" {317} an opinion very\r\nnatural in one who had been immersed in the study of the general\r\nanalogies of the forms of plants. But though this is excusable in\r\nCæsalpinus, the rejection of this definiteness of form a hundred\r\nyears later, when its existence had been proved, and its laws\r\ndeveloped by numerous observers, cannot be ascribed to anything but\r\nstrong prejudice; yet this was the course taken by no less a person\r\nthan Buffon. \"The form of crystallization,\" says he,[4\\15] \"is _not\r\na constant character_, but is more equivocal and more variable than\r\nany other of the characters by which minerals are to be\r\ndistinguished.\" And accordingly, he makes no use of this most\r\nimportant feature in his history of minerals. This strange\r\nperverseness may perhaps be ascribed to the dislike which Buffon is\r\nsaid to have entertained for Linnæus, who had made crystalline form\r\na leading character of minerals.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\15: _Nat. Hist._ xxvii. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\15: p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\15: p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\15: _Hist. des Min._ p. 343.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to mark all the minute steps by which\r\nmineralogists were gradually led to see clearly the nature and laws\r\nof the fixity of crystalline forms. These forms were at first\r\nnoticed in that substance which is peculiarly called rock-crystal or\r\nquartz; and afterwards in various stones and gems, in salts obtained\r\nfrom various solutions, and in snow. But those who observed the\r\nremarkable regular figures which these substances assume, were at\r\nfirst impelled onwards in their speculations by the natural tendency\r\nof the human mind to generalize and guess, rather than to examine\r\nand measure. They attempted to snatch at once the general laws of\r\ngeometrical regularity of these occurrences, or to connect them with\r\nsome doctrine concerning formative causes. Thus Kepler,[5\\15] in his\r\n_Harmonics of the World_, asserts a \"_formatrix facultas_, which has\r\nits seat in the entrails of the earth, and, after the manner of a\r\npregnant woman, expresses the five regular geometrical solids in the\r\nforms of gems.\" But Philosophers, in the course of time, came to\r\nbuild more upon observation, and less upon abstract reasonings.\r\nNicolas Steno, a Dane, published, in 1669, a dissertation _De Solido\r\nintra Solidum Naturaliter contento_, in which he says,[6\\15] that\r\nthough the sides of the hexagonal crystal may vary, _the angles are\r\nnot changed_. And Dominic Gulielmini, in a _Dissertation on Salts_,\r\npublished in 1707, says,[7\\15] in a true inductive spirit, \"Nature\r\ndoes not employ all figures, but only certain ones of those which\r\nare possible; and of these, the determination is not to be fetched\r\nfrom the brain, or proved _à priori_, but obtained by experiments\r\nand observations.\" And {318} he speaks[8\\15] with entire decision on\r\nthis subject: \"Nevertheless since there is here a principle of\r\ncrystallization, the inclination of the planes and of the angles is\r\nalways constant.\" He even anticipates, very nearly, the views of\r\nlater crystallographers as to the mode in which crystals are formed\r\nfrom elementary molecules. From this time, many persons labored and\r\nspeculated on this subject; as Cappeller, whose _Prodromus\r\nCrystallographiæ_ appeared at Lucern in 1723; Bourguet, who\r\npublished _Lettres Philosophiques sur la Formation de Sels et de\r\nCristaux_, at Amsterdam, in 1792; and Henckel, the \"Physicus\" of the\r\nElector of Saxony, whose _Pyritologia_ came forth in 1725. In this\r\nlast work we have an example of the description of the various forms\r\nof special classes of minerals, (iron pyrites, copper pyrites, and\r\narsenic pyrites;) and an example of the enthusiasm which this\r\napparently dry and laborious study can excite: \"Neither tongue nor\r\nstone,\" he exclaims,[9\\15] \"can express the satisfaction which I\r\nreceived on setting eyes upon this sinter covered with galena; and\r\nthus it constantly happens, that one must have more pleasure in what\r\nseems worthless rubbish, than in the purest and most precious ores,\r\nif we know aught of minerals.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\15: Linz. 1619, p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\15: p. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\15: p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\15: p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\15: p. 343.]\r\n\r\nStill, however, Henckel[10\\15] disclaims the intention of arranging\r\nminerals according to their mathematical forms; and this, which may\r\nbe considered as the first decided step in the formation of\r\ncrystallographic mineralogy, appears to have been first attempted by\r\nLinnæus. In this attempt, however, he was by no means happy; nor\r\ndoes he himself appear to have been satisfied. He begins his preface\r\nby saying, \"Lithology is not what I plume myself upon.\" (_Lithologia\r\nmihi cristas non eriget_.) Though his sagacity, as a natural\r\nhistorian, led him to see that crystalline form was one of the most\r\ndefinite, and therefore most important, characters of minerals, he\r\nfailed in profiting by this thought, because, in applying it, he did\r\nnot employ the light of geometry, but was regulated by what appeared\r\nto him resemblances, arbitrarily selected, and often\r\ndelusive.[11\\15] Thus he derived the form of pyrites from that of\r\nvitriol;[12\\15] and brought together alum and diamond on account of\r\ntheir common octohedral form. But he had the great merit of\r\nanimating to this study one to whom, more perhaps than to any other\r\nperson, it owes its subsequent progress; I mean Romé de Lisle.\r\n\"Instructed,\" this writer says, in his preface to his _Essais de\r\nCrystallographie_, \"by the works of the celebrated Von Linnée, how\r\n{319} greatly the study of the angular form of crystals might become\r\ninteresting, and fitted to extend the sphere of our mineralogical\r\nknowledge, I have followed them in all their metamorphoses with the\r\nmost scrupulous attention.\" The views of Linnæus, as to the\r\nimportance of this character, had indeed been adopted by several\r\nothers; as John Hill, the King's gardener at Kew, who, in 1777,\r\npublished his _Spathogenesia_; and Grignon, who, in 1775, says,\r\n\"These crystallizations may give the means of finding a new theory\r\nof the generation of crystalline gems.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\15: p. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\15: Marx. _Gesch._ p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\15: _Syst. Nat._ vi. p. 220.]\r\n\r\nThe circumstance which threw so much difficulty in the way of those\r\nwho tried to follow out his thought was, that in consequence of the\r\napparent irregularity of crystals, arising from the extension or\r\ncontraction of particular sides of the figure, each kind of\r\nsubstance may really appear under many different forms, connected\r\nwith each other by certain geometrical relations. These may be\r\nconceived by considering a certain fundamental form to be cut into\r\nnew forms in particular ways. Thus if we take a cube, and cut off\r\nall the eight corners, till the original faces disappear, we make it\r\nan octohedron; and if we stop short of this, we have a figure of\r\nfourteen faces, which has been called a _cubo-octohedron_. The first\r\nperson who appears distinctly to have conceived this _truncation_ of\r\nangles and edges, and to have introduced the word, is\r\nDémeste;[13\\15] although Wallerius[14\\15] had already said, in\r\nspeaking of the various crystalline forms of calcspar, \"I conceive\r\nit would be better not to attend to all differences, lest we be\r\noverwhelmed by the number.\" And Werner, in his celebrated work _On\r\nthe External Characters of Minerals_,[15\\15] had formally spoken of\r\n_truncation_, _acuation_, and _acumination_, or replacement by a\r\nplane, an edge, a point respectively, (_abstumpfung_, _zuschärfung_,\r\n_zuspitzung_,) as ways in which the forms of crystals are modified\r\nand often disguised. He applied this process in particular to show\r\nthe connexion of the various forms which are related to the cube.\r\nBut still the extension of the process to the whole range of minerals\r\nand other crystalline bodies, was due to Romé de Lisle. {320}\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\15: _Lettres_, 1779, i. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\15: _Systema Mineralogicum_, 1772-5, i. 143.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\15:  Leipzig, 1774.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEPOCH OF ROMÉ DE LISLE AND HAÜY.--ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIXITY OF\r\nCRYSTALLINE ANGLES, AND THE SIMPLICITY OF THE LAWS OF DERIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have already seen that, before 1780, several mineralogists had\r\nrecognized the constancy of the angles of crystals, and had seen (as\r\nDémeste and Werner,) that the forms were subject to modifications of\r\na definite kind. But neither of these two thoughts was so\r\napprehended and so developed, as to supersede the occasion for a\r\ndiscoverer who should put forward these principles as what they\r\nreally were, the materials of a new and complete science. The merit\r\nof this step belongs jointly to Romé de Lisle and to Haüy. The\r\nformer of these two men had already, in 1772, published an _Essai de\r\nCrystallographie_, in which he had described a number of crystals.\r\nBut in this work his views are still rude and vague; he does not\r\nestablish any connected sequence of transitions in each kind of\r\nsubstance, and lays little or no stress on the angles. But in 1783,\r\nhis ideas[16\\15] had reached a maturity which, by comparison,\r\nexcites our admiration. In this he asserts, in the most distinct\r\nmanner, the _invariability_ of the angles of crystals of each kind,\r\nunder all the changes of relative dimension which the faces may\r\nundergo;[17\\15] and he points out that this invariability applies\r\nonly to the _primitive forms_, from each of which many secondary\r\nforms are derived by various changes.[18\\15] Thus we cannot deny him\r\nthe merit of having taken steady hold on both the handles of this\r\ndiscovery, though something still remained for another to do. Romé\r\npursues his general ideas into detail with great labor and skill. He\r\ngives drawings of more than five hundred regular forms (in his first\r\nwork he had inserted only one hundred and ten; Linnæus only knew\r\nforty); and assigns them to their proper substances; for instance,\r\nthirty to calcspar, and sixteen to felspar. He also invented and\r\nused a goniometer. We cannot doubt that he would have been {321}\r\nlooked upon as a great discoverer, if his fame had not been dimmed\r\nby the more brilliant success of his contemporary Haüy.\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\15: _Cristallographie, ou Description de Formes propres à\r\ntous les Corps du Règne Minéral._ 3 vols. and 1 vol. of plates.]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\15: p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\15: p. 73.]\r\n\r\nRéné-Just Haüy is rightly looked upon as the founder of the modern\r\nschool of crystallography; for all those who have, since him,\r\npursued the study with success, have taken his views for their\r\nbasis. Besides publishing a system of crystallography and of\r\nmineralogy, far more complete than any which had yet appeared, the\r\npeculiar steps in the advance which belong to him are, the discovery\r\nof the importance of _cleavage_, and the consequent expression of\r\nthe laws of derivation of secondary from primary forms, by means of\r\nthe _decrements_ of the successive layers of _integrant molecules_.\r\n\r\nThe latter of these discoveries had already been, in some measure,\r\nanticipated by Bergman, who had, in 1773, conceived a hexagonal\r\nprism to be built up by the juxtaposition of solid rhombs on the\r\nplanes of a rhombic nucleus.[19\\15] It is not clear[20\\15] whether\r\nHaüy was acquainted with Bergman's Memoir, at the time when the\r\ncleavage of a hexagonal prism of calcspar, accidentally obtained,\r\nled him to the same conception of its structure. But however this\r\nmight be, he had the indisputable credit of following out this\r\nconception with all the vigor of originality, and with the most\r\nlaborious and persevering earnestness; indeed he made it the\r\nbusiness of his life. The hypothesis of a solid, built up of small\r\nsolids, had this peculiar advantage in reference to crystallography;\r\nit rendered a reason of this curious fact;--that a certain series of\r\nforms occur in crystals of the same kind, while other forms,\r\napparently intermediate between those which actually occur, are\r\nrigorously excluded. The doctrine of decrements explained this; for\r\nby placing a number of regularly-decreasing rows of equal solids,\r\nas, for instance, of bricks, upon one another, we might form a\r\nregular equal-sided triangle, as the gable of a house; and if the\r\nbreadth of the gable were one hundred bricks, the height of the\r\ntriangle might be one hundred, or fifty, or twenty-five; but it\r\nwould be found that if the height were an intermediate number, as\r\nfifty-seven, or forty-three, the edge of the wall would become\r\nirregular; and such irregularity is assumed to be inadmissible in\r\nthe regular structure of crystals. Thus this mode of conceiving\r\ncrystals allows of certain definite secondary forms, and no others.\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\15: _De Formis Crystallorum._ Nov. Act. Reg. Soc. Sc. Ups.\r\n1773.]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\15: _Traité de Minér._ 1822, i. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe mathematical deduction of the dimensions and proportions {322}\r\nof these secondary forms;--the invention of a notation to express\r\nthem;--the examination of the whole mineral kingdom in accordance\r\nwith these views;--the production of a work[21\\15] in which they are\r\nexplained with singular clearness and vivacity;--are services by\r\nwhich Haüy richly earned the admiration which has been bestowed upon\r\nhim. The wonderful copiousness and variety of the forms and laws to\r\nwhich he was led, thoroughly exercised and nourished the spirit of\r\ndeduction and calculation which his discoveries excited in him. The\r\nreader may form some conception of the extent of his labors, by\r\nbeing told--that the mere geometrical propositions which he found it\r\nnecessary to premise to his special descriptions, occupy a volume\r\nand a half of his work;--that his diagrams are nearly a thousand in\r\nnumber;--that in one single substance (calcspar) he has described\r\nforty-seven varieties of form;--and that he has described one kind\r\nof crystal (called by him _fer sulfuré parallélique_) which has one\r\nhundred and thirty-four faces.\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\15: _Traité de Minéralogie_, 1801, 5 vols.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a long life, he examined, with considerable care,\r\nall the forms he could procure of all kinds of mineral; and the\r\ninterpretation which he gave of the laws of those forms was, in many\r\ncases, fixed, by means of a name applied to the mineral in which the\r\nform occurred; thus, he introduced such names as _équiaxe_,\r\n_métastatique_, _unibinaire_, _perihexahèdre_, _bisalterne_, and\r\nothers. It is not now desirable to apply separate names to the\r\ndifferent forms of the same mineral species, but these terms\r\nanswered the purpose, at the time, of making the subjects of study\r\nmore definite. A symbolical notation is the more convenient mode of\r\ndesignating such forms, and such a notation Haüy invented; but the\r\nsymbols devised by him had many inconveniences, and have since been\r\nsuperseded by the systems of other crystallographers.\r\n\r\nAnother of Haüy's leading merits was, as we have already intimated,\r\nto have shown, more clearly than his predecessors had done, that the\r\ncrystalline angles of substances are a criterion of the substances;\r\nand that this is peculiarly true of the _angles of cleavage_;--that\r\nis, the angles of those edges which are obtained by cleaving a\r\ncrystal in two different directions;--a mode of division which the\r\nstructure of many kinds of crystals allowed him to execute in the\r\nmost complete manner. As an instance of the employment of this\r\ncriterion, I may mention his separation of the sulphates of baryta\r\nand strontia, which had {323} previously been confounded. Among\r\ncrystals which in the collections were ranked together as \"heavy\r\nspar,\" and which were so perfect as to admit of accurate\r\nmeasurement, he found that those which were brought from Sicily, and\r\nthose of Derbyshire, differed in their cleavage angle by three\r\ndegrees and a half. \"I could not suppose,\" he says,[22\\15] \"that\r\nthis difference was the effect of any law of decrement; for it would\r\nhave been necessary to suppose so rapid and complex a law, that such\r\nan hypothesis might have been justly regarded as an abuse of the\r\ntheory.\" He was, therefore, in great perplexity. But a little while\r\nprevious to this, Klaproth had discovered that there is an earth\r\nwhich, though in many respects it resembles baryta, is different\r\nfrom it in other respects; and this earth, from the place where it\r\nwas found (in Scotland), had been named _Strontia_. The French\r\nchemists had ascertained that the two earths had, in some cases,\r\nbeen mixed or confounded; and Vauquelin, on examining the Sicilian\r\ncrystals, found that their base was strontia, and not, as in the\r\nDerbyshire ones, baryta. The riddle was now read; all the crystals\r\nwith the larger angle belong to the one, all those with the smaller,\r\nto the other, of these two sulphates; and crystallometry was clearly\r\nrecognized as an authorized test of the difference of substances\r\nwhich nearly resemble each other.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\15: _Traité_, ii. 320.]\r\n\r\nEnough has been said, probably, to enable the reader to judge how\r\nmuch each of the two persons, now under review, contributed to\r\ncrystallography. It would be unwise to compare such contributions to\r\nscience with the great discoveries of astronomy and chemistry; and\r\nwe have seen how nearly the predecessors of Romé and Haüy had\r\nreached the point of knowledge on which these two crystallographers\r\ntook their stand. But yet it is impossible not to allow, that in\r\nthese discoveries, which thus gave form and substance to the science\r\nof crystallography, we have a manifestation of no common sagacity\r\nand skill. Here, as in other discoveries, were required ideas and\r\nfacts;--clearness of geometrical conception which could deal with\r\nmost complex relations of form; a minute and extensive acquaintance\r\nwith actual crystals; and the talent and habit of referring these\r\nfacts to the general ideas. Haüy, in particular, was happily endowed\r\nfor his task. Without being a great mathematician, he was\r\nsufficiently a geometer to solve all the problems which his\r\nundertaking demanded; and though the mathematical reasoning might\r\nhave been made more compendious {324} by one who was more at home in\r\nmathematical generalization, probably this could hardly have been\r\ndone without making the subject less accessible and less attractive\r\nto persons moderately disciplined in mathematics. In all his\r\nreasonings upon particular cases, Haüy is acute and clear; while his\r\ngeneral views appear to be suggested rather by a lively fancy than\r\nby a sage inductive spirit: and though he thus misses the character\r\nof a great philosopher, the vivacity of style, and felicity and\r\nhappiness of illustration, which grace his book, and which agree\r\nwell with the character of an Abbé of the old French monarchy, had a\r\ngreat and useful influence on the progress of the subject.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Romé de Lisle and Haüy were not only rivals, but in\r\nsome measure enemies. The former might naturally feel some vexation\r\nat finding himself, in his later years (he died in 1790), thrown\r\ninto shade by his more brilliant successor. In reference to Haüy's\r\nuse of cleavage, he speaks[23\\15] of \"innovators in crystallography,\r\nwho may properly be called _crystalloclasts_.\" Yet he adopted, in\r\ngreat measure, the same views of the formation of crystals by\r\nlaminæ,[24\\15] which Haüy illustrated by the destructive process at\r\nwhich he thus sneers. His sensitiveness was kept alive by the\r\nconduct of the Academy of Sciences, which took no notice of him and\r\nhis labors;[25\\15] probably because it was led by Buffon, who\r\ndisliked Linnæus, and might dislike Romé as his follower; and who,\r\nas we have seen, despised crystallography. Haüy revenged himself by\r\nrarely mentioning Romé in his works, though it was manifest that his\r\nobligations to him were immense; and by recording his errors while\r\nhe corrected them. More fortunate than his rival, Haüy was, from the\r\nfirst, received with favor and applause. His lectures at Paris were\r\neagerly listened to by persons from all quarters of the world. His\r\nviews were, in this manner, speedily diffused; and the subject was\r\nsoon pursued, in various ways, by mathematicians and mineralogists\r\nin every country of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\15: Pref. p. xxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\15: T. ii. p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\15: Marx. _Gesch. d. Cryst._ 130.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AND CORRECTIONS OF THE HAUÏAN CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE not hitherto noticed the imperfections of the\r\ncrystallographic views and methods of Haüy, because my business in\r\nthe last section {325} was to mark the permanent additions he made\r\nto the science. His system did, however, require completion and\r\nrectification in various points; and in speaking of the\r\ncrystallographers of the subsequent time, who may all be considered\r\nas the cultivators of the Hauïan doctrines, we must also consider\r\nwhat they did in correcting them.\r\n\r\nThe three main points in which this improvement was needed were;--a\r\nbetter determination of the crystalline forms of the special\r\nsubstances;--a more general and less arbitrary method of considering\r\ncrystalline forms according to their symmetry; and a detection of\r\nmore general conditions by which the crystalline angle is regulated.\r\nThe first of these processes may be considered as the natural sequel\r\nof the Hauïan epoch: the other two must be treated as separate steps\r\nof discovery.\r\n\r\nWhen it appeared that the angle of natural or of cleavage faces\r\ncould be used to determine the differences of minerals, it became\r\nimportant to measure this angle with accuracy. Haüy's measurements\r\nwere found very inaccurate by many succeeding crystallographers:\r\nMohs says[26\\15] that they are so generally inaccurate, that no\r\nconfidence can be placed in them. This was said, of course,\r\naccording to the more rigorous notions of accuracy to which the\r\nestablishment of Haüy's system led. Among the persons who\r\nprincipally labored in ascertaining, with precision, the crystalline\r\nangles of minerals, were several Englishmen, especially Wollaston,\r\nPhillips, and Brooke. Wollaston, by the invention of his Reflecting\r\nGoniometer, placed an entirely new degree of accuracy within the\r\nreach of the crystallographer; the angle of two faces being, in this\r\ninstrument, measured by means of the reflected images of bright\r\nobjects seen in them, so that the measure is the more accurate the\r\nmore minute the faces are. In the use of this instrument, no one was\r\nmore laborious and successful than William Phillips, whose power of\r\napprehending the most complex forms with steadiness and clearness,\r\nled Wollaston to say that he had \"a geometrical sense.\" Phillips\r\npublished a Treatise on Mineralogy, containing a great collection of\r\nsuch determinations; and Mr. Brooke, a crystallographer of the same\r\nexact and careful school, has also published several works of the\r\nsame kind. The precise measurement of crystalline angles must be the\r\nfamiliar employment of all who study crystallography; and,\r\ntherefore, any further enumeration of those {326} who have added in\r\nthis way to the stock of knowledge, would be superfluous.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\15: Marx. p. 153.]\r\n\r\nNor need I dwell long on those who added to the knowledge which Haüy\r\nleft, of derived forms. The most remarkable work of this kind was\r\nthat of Count Bournon, who published a work on a single mineral\r\n(calcspar) in three quarto volumes.[27\\15] He has here given\r\nrepresentations of seven hundred forms of crystals, of which,\r\nhowever, only fifty-six are essentially different. From this example\r\nthe reader may judge what a length of time, and what a number of\r\nobservers and calculators, were requisite to exhaust the subject.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\15: _Traité complet de la Chaux Carbonatée et d'Aragonite_,\r\npar M. le Comte de Bournon. London, 1808.]\r\n\r\nIf the calculations, thus occasioned, had been conducted upon the\r\nbasis of Haüy's system, without any further generalization, they\r\nwould have belonged to that process, the natural sequel of inductive\r\ndiscoveries, which we call _deduction_; and would have needed only a\r\nvery brief notice here. But some additional steps were made in the\r\nupward road to scientific truth, and of these we must now give an\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE DISTINCTION OF SYSTEMS OF\r\nCRYSTALLIZATION.--WEISS AND MOHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN Haüy's views, as generally happens in new systems, however true,\r\nthere was involved something that was arbitrary, something that was\r\nfalse or doubtful, something that was unnecessarily limited. The\r\nprincipal points of this kind were;--his having made the laws of\r\ncrystalline derivation depend so much upon cleavage;--his having\r\nassumed an atomic constitution of bodies as an essential part of his\r\nsystem; and his having taken a set of primary forms, which, being\r\nselected by no general view, were partly superfluous, and partly\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nHow far evidence, such as has been referred to by various\r\nphilosophers, has proved, or can prove, that bodies are constituted\r\nof indivisible atoms, will be more fully examined in the work which\r\ntreats of the Philosophy of this subject. There can be little doubt\r\nthat the {327} portion of Haüy's doctrine which most riveted popular\r\nattention and applause, was his dissection of crystals, in a manner\r\nwhich was supposed to lead actually to their ultimate material\r\nelements. Yet it is clear, that since the solids given by cleavage\r\nare, in many cases, such as cannot make up a solid space, the\r\nprimary conception of a necessary geometrical identity between the\r\nresults of division and the elements of composition, which is the\r\nsole foundation of the supposition that crystallography points out\r\nthe actual elements, disappears on being scrutinized: and when Haüy,\r\npressed by this difficulty, as in the case of fluor-spar, put his\r\nintegrant octohedral molecules together, touching by the edges only,\r\nhis method became an empty geometrical diagram, with no physical\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nThe real fact, divested of the hypothesis which was contained in the\r\nfiction of decrements, was, that when the relation of the derivative\r\nto the primary faces is expressed by means of numerical indices,\r\nthese numbers are integers, and generally very small ones; and this\r\nwas the form which the law gradually assumed, as the method of\r\nderivation was made more general and simple by Weiss and others.\r\n\r\n\"When, in 1809, I published my Dissertation,\" says Weiss,[28\\15] \"I\r\nshared the common opinion as to the necessity of the assumption and\r\nthe reality of the existence of a primitive form, at least in a\r\nsense not very different from the usual sense of the expression.\r\nWhile I sought,\" he adds, referring to certain doctrines of general\r\nphilosophy which he and others entertained, \"a _dynamical_ ground\r\nfor this, instead of the untenable atomistic view, I found that, out\r\nof my primitive forms, there was gradually unfolded to my hands,\r\nthat which really governs them, and is not affected by their casual\r\nfluctuations, the fundamental relations of those Dimensions\r\naccording to which a multiplicity of internal oppositions,\r\nnecessarily and mutually interdependent, are developed in the mass,\r\neach having its own polarity; so that the crystalline character is\r\nco-extensive with these polarities.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\15: _Mem. Acad. Berl._ 1816, p. 307.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Dimensions\" of which Weiss here speaks, are the _Axes of\r\nSymmetry_ of the crystal; that is, those lines in reference to\r\nwhich, every face is accompanied by other faces, having like\r\npositions and properties. Thus a rhomb, or more properly a\r\n_rhombohedron_,[29\\15] of {328} calcspar may be placed with one of\r\nits obtuse corners uppermost, so that all the three faces which meet\r\nthere are equally inclined to the vertical line. In this position,\r\nevery derivative face, which is obtained by any modification of the\r\nfaces or edges of the rhombohedron, implies either three or six such\r\nderivative faces; for no one of the three upper faces of the\r\nrhombohedron has any character or property different from the other\r\ntwo; and, therefore, there is no reason for the existence of a\r\nderivative from one of these primitive faces, which does not equally\r\nhold for the other primitive faces. Hence the derivative forms will,\r\nin all cases, contain none but faces connected by this kind of\r\ncorrespondence. The axis thus made vertical will be an Axis of\r\nSymmetry, and the crystal will consist of three divisions, ranged\r\nround this axis, and exactly resembling each other. According to\r\nWeiss's nomenclature, such a crystal is \"three-and-three-membered.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\15: I use this name for the solid figure, since _rhomb_ has\r\nalways been used for a plane figure.]\r\n\r\nBut this is only one of the kinds of symmetry which crystalline\r\nforms may exhibit. They may have _three axes_ of complete and\r\n_equal_ symmetry at right angles to each other, as the cube and the\r\nregular octohedron;--or, _two axes_ of equal symmetry, perpendicular\r\nto each other and to a _third axis_, which is not affected with the\r\nsame symmetry with which they are; such a figure is a square\r\npyramid;--or they may have _three_ rectangular _axes_, all of\r\n_unequal_ symmetry, the modifications referring to each axis\r\nseparately from the other two.\r\n\r\nThese are essential and necessary distinctions of crystalline form;\r\nand the introduction of a classification of forms founded on such\r\nrelations, or, as they were called, _Systems of Crystallization_,\r\nwas a great improvement upon the divisions of the earlier\r\ncrystallographers, for those divisions were separated according to\r\ncertain arbitrarily-assumed primary forms. Thus Romé de Lisle's\r\nfundamental forms were, the tetrahedron, the cube, the octohedron,\r\nthe rhombic prism, the rhombic octohedron, the dodecahedron with\r\ntriangular faces: Haüy's primary forms are the cube, the\r\nrhombohedron, the oblique rhombic prism, the right rhombic prism,\r\nthe rhombic dodecahedron, the regular octohedron, tetrahedron, and\r\nsix-sided prism, and the bipyramidal dodecahedron. This division, as\r\nI have already said, errs both by excess and defect, for some of\r\nthese primary forms might be made derivatives from others; and no\r\nsolid reason could be assigned why they were not. Thus the cube may\r\nbe derived from the tetrahedron, by truncating the edges; and the\r\nrhombic dodecahedron again from the cube, by truncating its edges;\r\nwhile the square pyramid could not be legitimately identified with\r\nthe derivative of any of these forms; for if we were to {329} derive\r\nit from the rhombic prism, why should the acute angles always suffer\r\ndecrements corresponding in a certain way to those of the obtuse\r\nangles, as they must do in order to give rise to a square pyramid?\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the method of reference to Systems of\r\nCrystallization has been a subject of controversy, some ascribing\r\nthis valuable step to Weiss, and some to Mohs.[30\\15] It appears, I\r\nthink, on the whole, that Weiss first published works in which the\r\nmethod is employed; but that Mohs, by applying it to all the known\r\nspecies of minerals, has had the merit of making it the basis of\r\nreal crystallography. Weiss, in 1809, published a Dissertation _On\r\nthe mode of investigating the principal geometrical character of\r\ncrystalline forms_, in which he says,[31\\15] \"No part, line, or\r\nquantity, is so important as the axis; no consideration is more\r\nessential or of a higher order than the relation of a crystalline\r\nplane to the axis;\" and again, \"An axis is any line governing the\r\nfigure, about which all parts are similarly disposed, and with\r\nreference to which they correspond mutually.\" This he soon followed\r\nout by examination of some difficult cases, as Felspar and Epidote.\r\nIn the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy,[32\\15] for 1814-15, he\r\npublished _An Exhibition of the natural Divisions of Systems of\r\nCrystallization_. In this Memoir, his divisions are as follows:--The\r\n_regular_ system, the _four-membered_, the _two-and-two-membered_,\r\nthe _three-and-three-membered_, and some others of inferior degrees\r\nof symmetry. These divisions are by Mohs (_Outlines of Mineralogy_,\r\n1822), termed the _tessular_, _pyramidal_, _prismatic_, and\r\n_rhombohedral_ systems respectively. Hausmann, in his\r\n_Investigations concerning the Forms of Inanimate Nature_,[33\\15]\r\nmakes a nearly corresponding arrangement;--the _isometric_,\r\n_monodimetric_, _trimetric_, and _monotrimetic_; and one or other of\r\nthese sets of terms have been adopted by most succeeding writers.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\15: _Edin. Phil. Trans._ 1823, vols. xv. and xvi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\15: pp. 16, 42.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\15: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\15: Göttingen, 1821.]\r\n\r\nIn order to make the distinctions more apparent, I have purposely\r\nomitted to speak of the systems which arise when the _prismatic_\r\nsystem loses some part of its symmetry;--when it has only half or a\r\nquarter its complete number of faces;--or, according to Mohs's\r\nphraseology, when it is _hemihedral_ or _tetartohedral_. Such\r\nsystems are represented by the singly-oblique or doubly-oblique\r\nprism; they are termed by Weiss _two-and-one-membered_, and\r\n_one-and-one-membered_; by other writers, _Monoklinometric_, and\r\n_Triklinometric_ Systems. There are also other {330} peculiarities\r\nof Symmetry, such, for instance, as that of the _plagihedral_ faces\r\nof quartz, and other minerals.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of an arrangement of crystalline forms into\r\nsystems, according to their degree of symmetry, was a step which was\r\nrather founded on a distinct and comprehensive perception of\r\nmathematical relations, than on an acquaintance with experimental\r\nfacts, beyond what earlier mineralogists had possessed. This\r\narrangement was, however, remarkably confirmed by some of the\r\nproperties of minerals which attracted notice about the time now\r\nspoken of, as we shall see in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AND CONFIRMATION OF THE DISTINCTION OF SYSTEMS OF\r\nCRYSTALLIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFUSION OF THE DISTINCTION OF SYSTEMS.--The distinction of systems\r\nof crystallization was so far founded on obviously true views, that\r\nit was speedily adopted by most mineralogists. I need not dwell on\r\nthe steps by which this took place. Mr. Haidinger's translation of\r\nMohs was a principal occasion of its introduction in England. As an\r\nindication of dates, bearing on this subject, perhaps I may be\r\nallowed to notice, that there appeared in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions for_ 1825, _A General Method of Calculating the\r\n**Angles of Crystals_, which I had written, and in which I referred\r\nonly to Haüy's views; but that in 1826,[34\\15] I published a Memoir\r\n_On the Classification of Crystalline Combinations_, founded on the\r\nmethods of Weiss and Mohs, especially the latter; with which I had\r\nin the mean time become acquainted, and which appeared to me to\r\ncontain their own evidence and recommendation. General methods, such\r\nas was attempted in the Memoir just quoted, are part of that process\r\nin the history of sciences, by which, when the principles are once\r\nestablished, the mathematical operation of deducing their\r\nconsequences is made more and more general and symmetrical: which we\r\nhave seen already exemplified in the history of celestial mechanics\r\nafter the time of Newton. It does not enter into our plan, to dwell\r\nupon the various steps in this way {331} made by Levy, Naumann,\r\nGrassmann, Kupffer, Hessel, and by Professor Miller among ourselves.\r\nI may notice that one great improvement was, the method introduced\r\nby Monteiro and Levy, of determining the laws of derivation of\r\nforces by means of the _parallelisms of edges_; which was afterwards\r\nextended so that faces were considered as belonging to _zones_. Nor\r\nneed I attempt to enumerate (what indeed it would be difficult to\r\ndescribe in words) the various methods of _notation_ by which it has\r\nbeen proposed to represent the faces of crystals, and to facilitate\r\nthe calculations which have reference to them.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\15: _Camb. Trans._ vol. ii. p. 391.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [My Memoir of 1825 depended on the views of Haüy in so far\r\nas that I started from his \"primitive forms;\" but being a general\r\nmethod of expressing all forms by co-ordinates, it was very little\r\ngoverned by these views. The mode of representing crystalline forms\r\nwhich I proposed seemed to contain its own evidence of being more\r\ntrue to nature than Haüy's theory of decrements, inasmuch as my\r\nmethod expressed the faces at much lower numbers. I determine a face\r\nby means of the dimensions of the primary form _divided_ by certain\r\nnumbers; Haüy had expressed the face virtually by the same\r\ndimensions _multiplied_ by numbers. In cases where my notation gives\r\nsuch numbers as (3, 4, 1), (1, 3, 7), (5, 1, 19), his method\r\ninvolves the higher numbers (4, 3, 12), (21, 7, 3), (19, 95, 5). My\r\nmethod however has, I believe, little value as a method of\r\n\"_calculating_ the angles of crystals.\"\r\n\r\nM. Neumann, of Königsberg, introduced a very convenient and elegant\r\nmode of representing the position of faces of crystals by\r\ncorresponding points on the surface of a circumscribing sphere. He\r\ngave (in 1823) the laws of the derivation of crystalline faces,\r\nexpressed geometrically by the intersection of zones, (_Beiträge zur\r\nKrystallonomie_.) The same method of indicating the position of\r\nfaces of crystals was afterwards, together with the notation,\r\nre-invented by M. Grassmann, (_Zur Krystallonomie und Geometrischen\r\nCombinationslehre_, 1829.) Aiding himself by the suggestions of\r\nthese writers, and partly adopting my method, Prof. Miller has\r\nproduced a work on Crystallography remarkable for mathematical\r\nelegance and symmetry; and has given expressions really useful for\r\ncalculating the angles of crystalline faces, (_A Treatise on\r\nCrystallography_. Cambridge, 1839.)]\r\n\r\n_Confirmation of the Distinction of Systems by the Optical\r\nProperties of Minerals.--Brewster._--I must not omit to notice the\r\nstriking confirmation which the distinction of systems of\r\ncrystallization received from optical discoveries, especially those\r\nof Sir D. Brewster. Of the {332} history of this very rich and\r\nbeautiful department of science, we have already given some account,\r\nin speaking of Optics. The first facts which were noticed, those\r\nrelating to double refraction, belonged exclusively to crystals of\r\nthe rhombohedral system. The splendid phenomena of the rings and\r\nlemniscates produced by dipolarizing crystals, were afterwards\r\ndiscovered; and these were, in 1817, classified by Sir David\r\nBrewster, according to the crystalline forms to which they belong.\r\nThis classification, on comparison with the distinction of Systems\r\nof Crystallization, resolved itself into a necessary relation of\r\nmathematical symmetry: all crystals of the pyramidal and\r\nrhombohedral systems, which from their geometrical character have a\r\nsingle axis of symmetry, are also optically uniaxal, and produce by\r\ndipolarization circular rings; while the prismatic system, which has\r\nno such single axis, but three unequal axes of symmetry, is optically\r\nbiaxal, gives lemniscates by dipolarized light, and according to\r\nFresnel's theory, has three rectangular axes of unequal elasticity.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I have placed Sir David Brewster's arrangement of\r\ncrystalline forms in this chapter, as an event belonging to the\r\n_confirmation_ of the distinctions of forms introduced by Weiss and\r\nMohs; because that arrangement was established, not on\r\ncrystallographical, but on optical grounds. But Sir David Brewster's\r\noptical discovery was a much greater step in science than the\r\nsystems of the two German crystallographers; and even in respect to\r\nthe crystallographical principle, Sir D. Brewster had an independent\r\nshare in the discovery. He divided crystalline forms into three\r\nclasses, enumerating the Hauïan \"primitive forms\" which belonged to\r\neach; and as he found some exceptions to this classification, (such\r\nas idocrase, &c.,) he ventured to pronounce that in those substances\r\nthe received primitive forms were probably erroneous; a judgment\r\nwhich was soon confirmed by a closer crystallographical scrutiny. He\r\nalso showed his perception of the mineralogical importance of his\r\ndiscovery by publishing it, not only in the _Phil. Trans._ (1818),\r\nbut also in the _Transactions of the Wernerian Society of Natural\r\nHistory_. In a second paper inserted in this later series, read in\r\n1820, he further notices Mohs's System of Crystallography, which had\r\nthen recently appeared, and points out its agreement with his own.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why I do not make his great optical discovery a\r\ncardinal point in the history of crystallography is, that as a\r\ncrystallographical system it is incomplete. Although we are thus led\r\nto distinguish the _tessular_ and the _prismatic_ systems (using\r\nMohs's terms) {333} from the _rhombohedral_ and the _square\r\nprismatic_, we are not led to distinguish the latter two from each\r\nother; inasmuch as they have no optical difference of character. But\r\nthis distinction is quite essential in crystallography; for these\r\ntwo systems have faces formed by laws as different as those of the\r\nother two systems.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Weiss and Mohs not only divided crystalline forms into\r\ncertain classes, but showed that by doing this, the derivation of\r\nall the existing forms from the fundamental ones assumed a new\r\naspect of simplicity and generality; and this was the essential part\r\nof what they did.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do not think it is too much to say as I have\r\nelsewhere said[35\\15] that \"Sir D. Brewster's optical experiments\r\nmust have led to a classification of crystals into the above\r\nsystems, or something nearly equivalent, even if crystals had not\r\nbeen so arranged by attention to their forms.\"]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\15: _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, B. viii. C.\r\niii. Art. 3.]\r\n\r\nMany other most curious trains of research have confirmed the\r\ngeneral truth, that the degree and kind of geometrical symmetry\r\ncorresponds exactly with the symmetry of the optical properties. As\r\nan instance of this, eminently striking for its singularity, we may\r\nnotice the discovery of Sir John Herschel, that the _plagihedral_\r\ncrystallization of quartz, by which it exhibits faces _twisted_ to\r\nthe right or the left, is accompanied by right-handed or left-handed\r\ncircular polarization respectively. No one acquainted with the\r\nsubject can now doubt, that the correspondence of geometrical and\r\noptical symmetry is of the most complete and fundamental kind.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Our knowledge with respect to the positions of the\r\noptical axes of the oblique prismatic crystals is still imperfect.\r\nIt appears to be ascertained that, in singly oblique crystals, one\r\nof the axes of optical elasticity coincides with the rectangular\r\ncrystallographic axis. In doubly oblique crystals, one of the axes\r\nof optical elasticity is, in many cases, coincident with the axis of\r\na principal zone. I believe no more determinate laws have been\r\ndiscovered.]\r\n\r\nThus the highest generalization at which mathematical\r\ncrystallographers have yet arrived, may be considered as fully\r\nestablished; and the science of Crystallography, in the condition in\r\nwhich these place it, is fit to be employed as one of the members of\r\nMineralogy, and thus to fill its appropriate place and office. {334}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCORRECTION OF THE LAW OF THE SAME ANGLE FOR THE SAME SUBSTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF ISOMORPHISM. MITSCHERLICH.--The discovery of which we\r\nnow have to speak may appear at first sight too large to be included\r\nin the history of crystallography, and may seem to belong rather to\r\nchemistry. But it is to be recollected that crystallography, from\r\nthe time of its first assuming importance in the hands of Haüy,\r\nfounded its claim to notice entirely upon its connexion with\r\nchemistry; crystalline forms were properties of _something_; but\r\n_what_ that something was, and how it might be modified without\r\nbecoming something else, no crystallographer could venture to\r\ndecide, without the aid of chemical analysis. Haüy had assumed, as\r\nthe general result of his researches, that the same chemical\r\nelements, combined in the same proportions, would always exhibit the\r\nsame crystalline form; and reciprocally, that the same form and\r\nangles (except in the obvious case of the tessular system, in which\r\nthe angles are determined by its _being_ the tessular system,)\r\nimplied the same chemical constitution. But this dogma could only be\r\nconsidered as an approximate conjecture; for there were many glaring\r\nand unexplained exceptions to it. The explanation of several of\r\nthese was beautifully described by the discovery that there are\r\nvarious elements which are _isomorphous_ to each other; that is,\r\nsuch that one may take the place of another without altering the\r\ncrystalline form; and thus the chemical composition may be much\r\nchanged, while the crystallographic character is undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThis truth had been caught sight of, probably as a guess only, by\r\nFuchs as early as 1815. In speaking of a mineral which had been\r\ncalled Gehlenite, he says, \"I hold the oxide of iron, not for an\r\nessential component part of this genus, but only as a _vicarious_\r\nelement, replacing so much lime. We shall find it necessary to\r\nconsider the results of several analyses of mineral bodies in this\r\npoint of view, if we wish, on the one hand, to bring them into\r\nagreement with the doctrine of chemical proportions, and on the\r\nother, to avoid unnecessarily splitting up genera.\" In a lecture _On\r\nthe Mutual Influence of_ {335} _Chemistry and Mineralogy_,[36\\15] he\r\nagain draws attention to his term _vicarious_ (_vicarirende_), which\r\nundoubtedly expresses the nature of the general law afterwards\r\nestablished by Mitscherlich in 1822.\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\15: Munich, 1820.]\r\n\r\nBut Fuchs's conjectural expression was only a prelude to\r\nMitscherlich's experimental discovery of isomorphism. Till many\r\ncareful analyses had given substance and signification to this\r\nconception of vicarious elements, it was of small value. Perhaps no\r\none was more capable than Berzelius of turning to the best advantage\r\nany ideas which were current in the chemical world; yet we find\r\nhim,[37\\15] in 1820, dwelling upon a certain vague view of these\r\ncases,--that \"oxides which contain equal doses of oxygen must have\r\ntheir general properties common;\" without tracing it to any definite\r\nconclusions. But his scholar, Mitscherlich, gave this proposition a\r\nreal crystallographical import. Thus he found that the carbonates of\r\nlime (calcspar,) of magnesia, of protoxide of iron, and of protoxide\r\nof manganese, agree in many respects of form, while the homologous\r\nangles vary through one or two degrees only; so again the carbonates\r\nof baryta, strontia, lead, and lime (arragonite), agree nearly; the\r\ndifferent kinds of felspar vary only by the substitution of one\r\nalkali for another; the phosphates are almost identical with the\r\narseniates of several bases. These, and similar results, were\r\nexpressed by saying that, in such cases, the bases, lime, protoxide\r\nof iron, and the rest, are _isomorphous_; or in the latter instance,\r\nthat the arsenic and phosphoric acids are isomorphous.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\15: _Essay on the Theory of Chemical Proportions_, p. 122.]\r\n\r\nSince, in some of these cases, the substitution of one element of\r\nthe isomorphous group for another does alter the angle, though\r\nslightly, it has since been proposed to call such groups\r\n_plesiomorphous_.\r\n\r\nThis discovery of isomorphism was of great importance, and excited\r\nmuch attention among the chemists of Europe. The history of its\r\nreception, however, belongs, in part, to the classification of\r\nminerals; for its effect was immediately to metamorphose the\r\nexisting chemical systems of arrangement. But even those\r\ncrystallographers and chemists who cared little for general systems\r\nof classification, received a powerful impulse by the expectation,\r\nwhich was now excited, of discovering definite laws connecting\r\nchemical constitution with crystalline form. Such investigations\r\nwere soon carried on with great activity. Thus, at a recent period,\r\nAbich analysed a number of tessular minerals, spinelle, pleonaste,\r\ngahnite, franklinite, and chromic iron oxide; and {336} seems to\r\nhave had some success in **giving a common type to their chemical\r\nformulæ, as there is a common type in their crystallization.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [It will be seen by the above account that Prof.\r\nMitscherlich's merit in the great discovery of Isomorphism is not at\r\nall narrowed by the previous conjectures of M. Fuchs. I am informed,\r\nmoreover, that M. Fuchs afterwards (in Schweigger's _Journal_)\r\nretracted the opinions he had put forward on this subject.]\r\n\r\n_Dimorphism._--My business is, to point out the connected truths\r\nwhich have been obtained by philosophers, rather than insulated\r\ndifficulties which still stand out to perplex them. I need not,\r\ntherefore, dwell on the curious cases of _dimorphism_; cases in\r\nwhich the same definite chemical compound of the same elements\r\nappears to have two different forms; thus the carbonate of lime has\r\ntwo forms, _calcspar_ and _arragonite_, which belong to different\r\nsystems of crystallization. Such facts may puzzle us; but they\r\nhardly interfere with any received general truths, because we have\r\nas yet no truths of very high order respecting the connexion of\r\nchemical constitution and crystalline form. Dimorphism does not\r\ninterfere with isomorphism; the two classes of facts stand at the\r\nsame stage of inductive generalization, and we wait for some higher\r\ntruth which shall include both, and rise above them.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [For additions to our knowledge of the Dimorphism of\r\nBodies, see Professor Johnstone's valuable _Report_ on that subject\r\nin the _Reports of the British Association_ for 1837. Substances\r\nhave also been found which are _trimorphous_. We owe to Professor\r\nMitscherlich the discovery of dimorphism, as well as of isomorphism:\r\nand to him also we owe the greater part of the knowledge to which\r\nthese discoveries have led.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH THE FIXITY OF OTHER PHYSICAL\r\nPROPERTIES.--WERNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE reflections from which it appeared, (at the end of the last\r\nBook,) that in order to obtain general knowledge respecting bodies,\r\nwe must give scientific fixity to our appreciation of their\r\nproperties, applies to their other properties as well as to their\r\ncrystalline {337} form. And though none of the other properties have\r\nyet been referred to standards so definite as that which geometry\r\nsupplies for crystals, a system has been introduced which makes\r\ntheir measures far more constant and precise than they are to a\r\ncommon undisciplined sense.\r\n\r\nThe author of this system was Abraham Gottlob Werner, who had been\r\neducated in the institutions which the Elector of Saxony had\r\nestablished at the mines of Freiberg. Of an exact and methodical\r\nintellect, and of great acuteness of the senses, Werner was well\r\nfitted for the task of giving fixity to the appreciation of outward\r\nimpressions; and this he attempted in his _Dissertation on the\r\nexternal Characters of Fossils_, which was published at Leipzig in\r\n1774. Of the precision of his estimation of such characters, we may\r\njudge from the following story, told by his biographer\r\nFrisch.[38\\15] One of his companions had received a quantity of\r\npieces of amber, and was relating to Werner, then very young, that\r\nhe had found in the lot one piece from which he could extract no\r\nsigns of electricity. Werner requested to be allowed to put his hand\r\nin the bag which contained these pieces, and immediately drew out\r\nthe unelectrical piece. It was yellow chalcedony, which is\r\ndistinguishable from amber by its weight and coldness.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\15: _Werner's Leben_, p. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe principal external characters which were subjected by Werner to\r\na systematic examination were color, lustre, hardness, and specific\r\ngravity. His subdivisions of the first character (_Color_), were\r\nvery numerous; yet it cannot be doubted that if we recollect them by\r\nthe eye, and not by their names, they are definite and valuable\r\ncharacters, and especially the metallic colors. Breithaupt, merely\r\nby the aid of this character, distinguished two new compounds among\r\nthe small grains found along with the grains of platinum, and\r\nusually confounded with them. The kinds of _Lustre_, namely,\r\n_glassy_, _fatty_, _adamantine_, _metallic_, are, when used in the\r\nsame manner, equally valuable. _Specific Gravity_ obviously admits\r\nof a numerical measure; and the _Hardness_ of a mineral was pretty\r\nexactly defined by the substances which it would scratch, and by\r\nwhich it was capable of being scratched.\r\n\r\nWerner soon acquired a reputation as a mineralogist, which drew\r\npersons from every part of Europe to Freiberg in order to hear his\r\nlectures; and thus diffused very widely his mode of employing\r\nexternal characters. It was, indeed, impossible to attend so closely\r\nto {338} these characters as the Wernerian method required, without\r\nfinding that they were more distinctive than might at first sight be\r\nimagined; and the analogy which this mode of studying Mineralogy\r\nestablished between that and other branches of Natural History,\r\nrecommended the method to those in whom a general inclination to\r\nsuch studies was excited. Thus Professor Jameson of Edinburgh, who\r\nhad been one of the pupils of Werner at Freiberg, not only published\r\nworks in which he promulgated the mineralogical doctrines of his\r\nmaster, but established in Edinburgh a \"Wernerian Society,\" having\r\nfor its object the general cultivation of Natural History.\r\n\r\nWerner's standards and nomenclature of external characters were\r\nsomewhat modified by Mohs, who, with the same kinds of talents and\r\nviews, succeeded him at Freiberg. Mohs reduced hardness to numerical\r\nmeasure by selecting ten known minerals, each harder than the other\r\nin order, from _talc_ to _corundum_ and _diamond_, and by making the\r\nplace which these minerals occupy in the list, the numerical measure\r\nof the hardness of those which are compared with them. The result of\r\nthe application of this fixed measurement and nomenclature of\r\nexternal characters will appear in the History of Classification, to\r\nwhich we now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{339}}\r\nSYSTEMATIC MINERALOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS AT THE CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Proper object of Classification._\r\n\r\nTHE fixity of the crystalline and other physical properties of\r\nminerals is turned to account by being made the means of classifying\r\nsuch objects. To use the language of Aristotle,[39\\15]\r\nClassification is the _architectonic_ science, to which\r\nCrystallography and the Doctrine of External Characters are\r\nsubordinate and ministerial, as the art of the bricklayer and\r\ncarpenter are to that of the architect. But classification itself is\r\nuseful only as subservient to an ulterior science, which shall\r\nfurnish us with knowledge concerning things so classified. To\r\nclassify is to divide and to name; and the value of the Divisions\r\nwhich we thus make, and of the names which we give them, is\r\nthis;--that they render exact knowledge and general propositions\r\npossible. Now the knowledge which we principally seek concerning\r\nminerals is a knowledge of their chemical composition; the general\r\npropositions to which we hope to be led are such as assert relations\r\nbetween their intimate constitution and their external attributes.\r\nThus our Mineralogical Classification must always have an eye turned\r\ntowards Chemistry. We cannot get rid of the fundamental conviction,\r\nthat the elementary composition of bodies, since it fixes their\r\nessence, must determine their properties. Hence all mineralogical\r\narrangements, whether they profess it or not, must be, in effect,\r\nchemical; they must have it for their object to bring into view a\r\nset of relations, which, whatever else they may be, are at least\r\nchemical relations. We may begin with the outside, but it is only in\r\norder to reach the inner {340} structure. We may classify without\r\nreference to chemistry; but if we do so, it is only that we may\r\nassert chemical propositions with reference to our classification.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\15: _Eth. Nicom._ i. 2.]\r\n\r\nBut, as we have already attempted to show, we not only may, but we\r\n_must_ classify, by other than chemical characters, in order to be\r\nable to make our classification the basis of chemical knowledge. In\r\norder to assert chemical truths concerning bodies, we must have the\r\nbodies known by some tests not chemical. The chemist cannot assert\r\nthat Arragonite does or does not contain Strontia, except the\r\nmineralogist can tell him whether any given specimen is or is not\r\n_Arragonite_. If chemistry be called upon to supply the\r\n_definitions_ as well as the _doctrines_ of mineralogy, the science\r\ncan only consist of identical propositions.\r\n\r\nYet chemistry has been much employed in mineralogical\r\nclassifications, and, it is generally believed, with advantage to\r\nthe science: How is this consistent with what has been said?\r\n\r\nTo this the answer is, that when this _has_ been done with\r\nadvantage, the authority of external characters, as well as of\r\nchemical constitution, has really been brought into play. We have\r\ntwo sets of properties to compare, chemical and physical; to exhibit\r\nthe connexion of these is the object of scientific mineralogy. And\r\nthough this connexion would be most distinctly asserted, if we could\r\nkeep the two sets of properties distinct, yet it may be brought into\r\nview in a great degree, by classifications in which both are\r\nreferred to as guides. Since the governing principle of the attempts\r\nat classification is the conviction that the chemical constitution\r\nand the physical properties have a definite relation to each other,\r\nwe appear entitled to use both kinds of evidence, in proportion as\r\nwe can best obtain each; and then the general consistency and\r\nconvenience of our system will be the security for its containing\r\nsubstantial knowledge, though this be not presented in a rigorously\r\nlogical or systematic form.\r\n\r\nSuch _mixed systems_ of classification, resting partly on chemical\r\nand partly on physical characters, naturally appeared as the\r\nearliest attempts in this way, before the two members of the subject\r\nhad been clearly separated in men's minds; and these systems,\r\ntherefore, we must first give an account of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Mixed Systems of Classification._\r\n\r\n_Early Systems._--The first attempts at classifying minerals went\r\nupon the ground of those differences of general aspect which had\r\nbeen {341} recognized in the formation of common language; as\r\n_earths_, _stones_, _metals_. But such arrangements were manifestly\r\nvague and confused; and when chemistry had advanced to power and\r\nhonor, her aid was naturally called in to introduce a better order.\r\n\"Hiarne and Bromell were, as far as I know,\" says[40\\15] Cronstedt,\r\n\"the first who founded any mineral system upon chemical principles;\r\nto them we owe the three known divisions of the most simple mineral\r\nbodies; viz., the _calcarei_, _vitrescentes_, and _apyri_.\" But\r\nCronstedt's own _Essay towards a System of Mineralogy_, published in\r\nSwedish in 1758, had perhaps more influence than any other, upon\r\nsucceeding systems. In this, the distinction of earths and stones,\r\nand also of vitrescent and non-vitrescent earths (_apyri_), is\r\nrejected. The earths are classed as _calcareous_, _siliceous_,\r\n_argillaceous_, and the like. Again, calcareous earth is pure (_calc\r\nspar_), or united with acid of vitriol (_gypsum_), or united with\r\nthe muriatic add (_sal ammoniac_), and the like. It is easy to see\r\nthat this is the method, which, in its general principle, has been\r\ncontinued to our own time. In such methods, it is supposed that we\r\ncan recognize the substance by its general appearance, and on this\r\nassumption, its place in the system conveys to us chemical knowledge\r\nconcerning it.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\15: _Mineralogy_, Pref. p. viii.]\r\n\r\nBut as the other branches of Natural History, and especially Botany,\r\nassumed a systematic form, many mineralogists became dissatisfied\r\nwith this casual and superficial mode of taking account of external\r\ncharacters; they became convinced, that in Mineralogy as in other\r\nsciences, classification must have its system and its rules. The\r\nviews which Werner ascribes to his teacher, Pabst van Ohain,[41\\15]\r\nshow the rise of those opinions which led through Werner to Mohs:\r\n\"He was of opinion that a natural mineral system must be constructed\r\nby chemical determinations, and external characters at the same time\r\n(_methodus mixta_); but that along with this, mineralogists ought\r\nalso to construct and employ what he called an _artificial system_,\r\nwhich might serve us as a guide (_loco indicis_) how to introduce\r\nnewly-discovered fossils into the system, and how to find easily and\r\nquickly those already known and introduced.\" Such an artificial\r\nsystem, containing not the grounds of classification, but marks for\r\nrecognition, was afterwards attempted by Mohs, and termed by him the\r\n_Characteristic_ of his system.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\15: Frisch. _Werner's Leben_, p. 15.]\r\n\r\n_Werner's System._--But, in the mean time, Werner's classification\r\nhad an extensive reign, and this was still a mixed system. Werner\r\nhimself, indeed, never published a system of mineralogy. \"We might\r\n{342} almost imagine,\" Cuvier says,[42\\15] \"that when he had\r\nproduced his nomenclature of external characters, he was affrighted\r\nwith his own creation; and that the reason of his writing so little\r\nafter his first essay, was to avoid the shackles which he had\r\nimposed upon others.\" His system was, indeed, made known both in and\r\nout of Germany, by his pupils; but in consequence of Werner's\r\nunwillingness to give it on his own authority, it assumed, in its\r\npublished forms, the appearance of an extorted secret imperfectly\r\ntold. A _Notice of the Mineralogical Cabinet of Mine-Director Pabst\r\nvon Ohain_, was, in 1792, published by Karsten and Hoffman, under\r\nWerner's direction; and conveyed by example, his views of\r\nmineralogical arrangement; and[43\\15] in 1816 his _Doctrine of\r\nClassification_ was surreptitiously copied from his manuscript, and\r\npublished in a German Journal, termed _The Hesperus_. But it was\r\nonly in 1817, after his death, that there appeared _Werner's Last\r\nMineral System_, edited from his papers by Breithaupt and Köhler:\r\nand by this time, as we shall soon see, other systems were coming\r\nforwards on the stage.\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\15: Cuv. _El._ ii. 314.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\15: Frisch. p. 52.]\r\n\r\nA very slight notice of Werner's arrangement will suffice to show\r\nthat it was, as we have termed it, a Mixed System. He makes four\r\ngreat Classes of fossils, _Earthy_, _Saline_, _Combustible_,\r\n_Metallic_: the earthy fossils are in eight Genera--Diamond, Zircon,\r\nSilica, Alumina, Talc, Lime, Baryta, Hallites. It is clear that\r\nthese genera are in the main chemical, for chemistry alone can\r\ndefinitely distinguish the different Earths which characterize them.\r\nYet the Wernerian arrangement supposed the distinctions to be\r\npractically made by reference to those external characters which the\r\nteacher himself could employ with such surpassing skill. And though\r\nit cannot be doubted, that the chemical views which prevailed around\r\nhim had a latent influence on his classification in some cases, he\r\nresolutely refused to bend his system to the authority of chemistry.\r\nThus,[44\\15] when he was blamed for having, in opposition to the\r\nchemists, placed diamond among the earthy fossils, he persisted in\r\ndeclaring that, mineralogically considered, it was a stone, and\r\ncould not be treated as anything else.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\15: Frisch. p. 62.]\r\n\r\nThis was an indication to that tendency, which, under his successor,\r\nled to a complete separation of the two grounds of classification.\r\nBut before we proceed to this, we must notice what was doing at this\r\nperiod in other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n_Haüy's System._--Though Werner, on his own principles, ought to\r\n{343} have been the first person to see the immense value of the\r\nmost marked of external characters, crystalline form, he did not, in\r\nfact, attach much importance to it. Perhaps he was in some measure\r\nfascinated by a fondness for those characters which he had himself\r\nsystematized, and the study of which did not direct him to look for\r\ngeometrical relations. However this may be, the glory of giving to\r\nCrystallography its just importance in Mineralogy is due to France:\r\nand the Treatise of Haüy, published in 1801, is the basis of the\r\nbest succeeding works of mineralogy. In this work, the arrangement\r\nis professedly chemical; and the classification thus established is\r\nemployed as the means of enunciating crystallographic and other\r\nproperties. \"The principal object of this Treatise,\" says the\r\nauthor,[45\\15] \"is the exposition and development of a method\r\nfounded on certain principles, which may serve as a frame-work for\r\nall the knowledge which Mineralogy can supply, aided by the\r\ndifferent sciences which can join hands with her and march on the\r\nsame line.**\" It is worthy of notice, as characteristic of this\r\nperiod of Mixed Systems, that the classification of Haüy, though\r\nfounded on principles so different from the Wernerian ones, deviates\r\nlittle from it in the general character of the divisions. Thus, the\r\nfirst Order of the first Class of Haüy is _Acidiferous Earthy\r\nSubstances_; the first genus is _Lime_; the species are, _Carbonate\r\nof Lime_, _Phosphate of Lime_, _Fluate of Lime_, _Sulphate of Lime_,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\15: Disc. Prél. p. xvii.]\r\n\r\n_Other Systems._--Such mixed methods were introduced also into this\r\ncountry, and have prevailed, we may say, up to the present time. The\r\n_Mineralogy_ of William Phillips, which was published in 1824, and\r\nwhich was an extraordinary treasure of crystallographic facts, was\r\narranged by such a mixed system; that is, by a system professedly\r\nchemical; but, inasmuch as a rigid chemical system is impossible,\r\nand the assumption of such a one leads into glaring absurdities, the\r\nsystem was, in this and other attempts of the same kind, corrected\r\nby the most arbitrary and lax application of other considerations.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious example of the difference of national intellectual\r\ncharacter, that the manifest inconsistencies of the prevalent\r\nsystems, which led in Germany, as we shall see, to bold and sweeping\r\nattempts at reform, produced in England a sort of contemptuous\r\ndespair with regard to systems in general;--a belief that no system\r\ncould be consistent or useful;--and a persuasion that the only\r\nvaluable knowledge is the accumulation of particular facts. This is\r\nnot the place to {344} explain how erroneous and unphilosophical\r\nsuch an opinion is. But we may notice that while such a temper\r\nprevails among us, our place in this science can never be found in\r\nadvance of that position which we are now considering as exemplified\r\nin the period of Werner and Haüy. So long as we entertain such views\r\nrespecting the objects of Mineralogy, we can have no share in the\r\nfortunes of the succeeding period of its history, to which I now\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS AT THE REFORM OF MINERALOGICAL SYSTEMS.--SEPARATION OF THE\r\nCHEMICAL AND NATURAL HISTORY METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Natural History System of Mohs._\r\n\r\nTHE chemical principle of classification, if pursued at random, as\r\nin the cases just spoken of leads to results at which a\r\nphilosophical spirit revolts; it separates widely substances which\r\nare not distinguishable; joins together bodies the most dissimilar;\r\nand in hardly any instance does it bring any truth into view. The\r\nvices of classifications like that of Haüy could not long be\r\nconcealed; but even before time had exposed the weakness of his\r\nsystem, Haüy himself had pointed out, clearly and without\r\nreserve,[46\\15] that a chemical system is only one side of the\r\nsubject, and supposes, as its counterpart, a science of external\r\ncharacters. In the mean time, the Wernerians were becoming more and\r\nmore in love with the form which they had given to such a science.\r\nIndeed, the expertness which Werner and his scholars acquired in the\r\nuse of external characters, justified some partiality for them. It\r\nis related of him,[47\\15] that, by looking at a piece of iron-ore,\r\nand poising it in his hand, he was able to tell, almost precisely,\r\nthe proportion of pure metal which it contained. And in the last\r\nyear of his life,[48\\15] he had marked out, as the employment of the\r\nensuing winter, the study of the system of Berzelius, with a view to\r\nfind out the laws of combination as disclosed by external\r\ncharacters. In the same spirit, his pupil {345} Breithaupt[49\\15]\r\nattempted to discover the ingredients of minerals by their\r\npeculiarities of crystallization. The persuasion that there must be\r\n_some_ connexion between composition and properties, transformed\r\nitself, in their minds, into a belief that they could seize the\r\nnature of the connexion by a sort of instinct.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\15: See his Disc. Prél.]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\15: Frisch. _Werner's Leben_, p. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\15: Frisch. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\15: _Dresdn. Auswahl_, vol. ii. p. 97.]\r\n\r\nThis opinion of the independency of the science of external\r\ncharacters, and of its sufficiency for its own object, at last\r\nassumed its complete form in the bold attempt to construct a system\r\nwhich should borrow nothing from chemistry. This attempt was made by\r\nFrederick Mohs, who had been the pupil of Werner, and was afterwards\r\nhis successor in the school of Freiberg; and who, by the acute and\r\nmethodical character of his intellect, and by his intimate knowledge\r\nof minerals, was worthy of his predecessor. Rejecting altogether all\r\ndivisions of which the import was chemical, Mohs turned for\r\nguidance, or at least for the light of analogy, to botany. His\r\nobject was to construct a _Natural System_ of mineralogy. What the\r\nconditions and advantages of a natural system of any province of\r\nnature are, we must delay to explain till we have before us, in\r\nbotany, a more luminous example of such a scheme. But further; in\r\nmineralogy, as in botany, besides the Natural System, by which we\r\n_form_ our classes, it is necessary to have an _Artificial System_\r\nby which we _recognize_ them;--a principle which, we have seen, had\r\nalready taken root in the school of Freiberg. Such an artificial\r\nsystem Mohs produced in his _Characteristic of the Mineral Kingdom_,\r\nwhich was published at Dresden in 1820; and which, though extending\r\nonly to a few pages, excited a strong interest in Germany, where\r\nmen's minds were prepared to interpret the full import of such a\r\nwork. Some of the traits of such a \"Characteristic\" had, indeed,\r\nbeen previously drawn by others; as for example, by Haüy, who\r\nnotices that each of his Classes has peculiar characters. For\r\ninstance, his First Class (acidiferous substances,) alone possesses\r\nthese combinations of properties; \"division into a regular\r\noctohedron, without being able to scratch glass; specific gravity\r\nabove 3·5, without being able to scratch glass.\" The extension of\r\nsuch characters into a scheme which should exhaust the whole mineral\r\nkingdom, was the undertaking of Mohs.\r\n\r\nSuch a collection of marks of classes, implied a classification\r\npreviously established, and accordingly, Mohs had created his own\r\nmineral system. His aim was to construct it, as we shall hereafter\r\nsee that other natural systems are constructed, by taking into\r\naccount _all_ the {346} resemblances and differences of the objects\r\nclassified. It is obvious that to execute such a work, implied a\r\nmost intimate and universal acquaintance with minerals;--a power of\r\ncombining in one vivid survey the whole mineral kingdom. To\r\nillustrate the spirit in which Professor Mohs performed his task, I\r\nhope I may be allowed to refer to my own intercourse with him. At an\r\nearly period of my mineralogical studies, when the very conception\r\nof a Natural System was new to me, he, with great kindliness of\r\ntemper, allowed me habitually to propose to him the scruples which\r\narose in my mind, before I could admit principles which appeared to\r\nme then so vague and indefinite; and answered my objections with\r\ngreat patience and most instructive clearness. Among other\r\ndifficulties, I one day propounded to him this;--\"You have published\r\na Treatise on Mineralogy, in which you have described _all_ the\r\nimportant properties of all known minerals. On your principles,\r\nthen, it ought to be possible, merely by knowing the descriptions in\r\nyour book, and without seeing any minerals, to construct a natural\r\nsystem; and this natural system ought to turn out identical with\r\nthat which you have produced, by so careful an examination of the\r\nminerals themselves.\" He pondered a moment, and then he answered,\r\n\"It is true; but what an enormous _imagination_ (_einbildungskraft_,\r\n_power of inward imagining_), a man must have for such a work!\"\r\nVividness of conception of sensible properties, and the steady\r\nintuition (_anschauung_) of objects, were deemed by him, and by the\r\nWernerian school in general, to be the most essential conditions of\r\ncomplete knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to describe Mohs's system in detail; it may\r\nsufficiently indicate its form to state that the following\r\nsubstances, such as I before gave as examples of other arrangements,\r\ncalcspar, gypsum, fluor spar, apatite, heavy spar, are by Mohs\r\ntermed respectively, _Rhombohedral Lime Haloide_, _Gyps Haloide_,\r\n_Octohedral Fluor Haloide_, _Rhombohedral Fluor Haloide_, _Prismatic\r\nHal Baryte_. These substances are thus referred to the _Orders_\r\nHaloide, and Baryte; to _Genera_ Lime Haloide, Fluor Haloide, Hal\r\nBaryte; and the _Species_ is an additional particularization.\r\n\r\nMohs not only aimed at framing such a system, but was also ambitious\r\nof giving to all minerals _Names_ which should accord with the\r\nsystem. This design was too bold to succeed. It is true, that a new\r\nnomenclature was much needed in mineralogy: it is true, too, that it\r\nwas reasonable to expect, from an improved classification, an\r\nimproved nomenclature, such as had been so happily obtained in\r\nbotany by the {347} reform of Linnæus. But besides the defects of\r\nMohs's system, he had not prepared his verbal novelties with the\r\ntemperance and skill of the great botanical reformer. He called upon\r\nmineralogists to change the name of almost every mineral with which\r\nthey were acquainted; and the proposed appellations were mostly of a\r\ncumbrous form, as the above example may serve to show. Such names\r\ncould have obtained general currency, only after a general and\r\ncomplete acceptance of the system; and the system did not possess,\r\nin a sufficient degree, that evidence which alone could gain it a\r\nhome in the belief of philosophers,--the coincidence of its results\r\nwith those of Chemistry. But before I speak finally of the fortunes\r\nof the Natural-history System, I will say something of the other\r\nattempt which was made about the same time to introduce a Reform\r\ninto Mineralogy from the opposite extremity of the science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Chemical System of Berzelius and others._\r\n\r\nIF the students of external characters were satisfied of the\r\nindependence of their method, the chemical analysts were naturally\r\nno less confident of the legitimate supremacy of their principles:\r\nand when the beginning of the present century had been distinguished\r\nby the establishment of the theory of definite proportions, and by\r\ndiscoveries which pointed to the electro-chemical theory, it could\r\nnot appear presumption to suppose, that the classification of\r\nbodies, so far as it depended on chemistry, might be presented in a\r\nform more complete and scientific than at any previous time.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to do this was made by the great Swedish chemist Jacob\r\nBerzelius. In 1816, he published his _Essay to establish a purely\r\nScientific System of Mineralogy, by means of the Application of the\r\nElectro-chemical Theory and the Chemical Doctrine of Definite\r\nProportions_. It is manifest that, for minerals which are\r\nconstituted by the law of Definite Proportions, this constitution\r\nmust be a most essential part of their character. The\r\nelectro-chemical theory was called in aid, in addition to the\r\ncomposition, because, distinguishing the elements of all compounds\r\nas electro-positive and electro-negative, and giving to every\r\nelement a place in a series, and a place defined by the degree of\r\nthese relations, it seemed to afford a rigorous and complete\r\nprinciple of arrangement. Accordingly, Berzelius, in his First\r\nSystem, arranged minerals according to their electro-positive\r\nelement, and the elements according to their electro-positive rank;\r\n{348} and supposed that he had thus removed all that was arbitrary\r\nand vague in the previous chemical systems of mineralogy.\r\n\r\nThough the attempt appeared so well justified by the state of\r\nchemical science, and was so plausible in its principle, it was not\r\nlong before events showed that there was some fallacy in these\r\nspecious appearances. In 1820, Mitscherlich discovered Isomorphism:\r\nby that discovery it appeared that bodies containing very different\r\nelectro-positive elements could not be distinguished from each\r\nother; it was impossible, therefore, to put them in distant portions\r\nof the classification;--and thus the first system of Berzelius\r\ncrumbled to pieces.\r\n\r\nBut Berzelius did not so easily resign his project. With the most\r\nunhesitating confession of his first failure, but with undaunted\r\ncourage, he again girded himself to the task of rebuilding his\r\nedifice. Defeated at the electro-positive position, he now resolved\r\nto make a stand at the electro-negative element. In 1824, he\r\npublished in the Transactions of the Swedish Academy, a Memoir _On\r\nthe Alterations in the Chemical Mineral System, which necessarily\r\nfollow from the Property exhibited by Isomorphous Bodies, of\r\nreplacing each other in given Proportions_. The alteration was, in\r\nfact, an inversion of the system, with an attempt still to preserve\r\nthe electro-chemical principle of arrangement. Thus, instead of\r\narranging metallic minerals according to the _metal_, under iron,\r\ncopper, &c., all the _sulphurets_ were classed together, all the\r\n_oxides_ together, all the _sulphates_ together, and so in other\r\nrespects. That such an order was a great improvement on the\r\npreceding one, cannot be doubted; but we shall see, I think, that as\r\na strict scientific system it was not successful. The discovery of\r\nisomorphism, however, naturally led to such attempts. Thus Gmelin\r\nalso, in 1825, published a mineral system,[50\\15] which, like that\r\nof Berzelius, founded its leading distinctions on the\r\nelectro-negative, or, as it was sometimes termed, the _formative_\r\nelement of bodies; and, besides this, took account of the _numbers_\r\nof atoms or proportions which appear in the composition of the body;\r\ndistinguishing, for instance, Silicates, as simple silicates, double\r\nsilicates, and so on, to _quintuple_ silicate (_Pechstein_) and\r\n_sextuple_ silicate (_Perlstein_). In like manner, Nordenskiöld\r\ndevised a system resting on the same bases, taking into account also\r\nthe crystalline form. In 1824, Beudant published his _Traité\r\nElémentaire de Minéralogie_, in which he professes to found his\r\narrangement on the electro-negative element, and on Ampère's\r\ncircular {349} arrangement of elementary substances. Such schemes\r\nexhibit rather a play of the mere logical faculty, exercising itself\r\non assumed principles, than any attempt at the real interpretation\r\nof nature. Other such pure chemical systems may have been published,\r\nbut it is not necessary to accumulate instances. I proceed to\r\nconsider their result.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\15: _Zeitsch. der Min._ 1825, p. 435.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Failure of the Attempts at Systematic Reform._\r\n\r\nIT may appear presumptuous to speak of the failure of those whom,\r\nlike Berzelius and Mohs, we acknowledge as our masters, at a period\r\nwhen, probably, they and some of their admirers still hold them to\r\nhave succeeded in their attempt to construct a consistent system.\r\nBut I conceive that my office as an historian requires me to exhibit\r\nthe fortunes of this science in the most distinct form of which they\r\nadmit, and that I cannot evade the duty of attempting to seize the\r\ntrue aspect of recent occurrences in the world of science. Hence I\r\nventure to speak of the failure of both the attempts at framing a\r\npure scientific system of mineralogy,--that founded on the chemical,\r\nand that founded on the natural-history principle; because it is\r\nclear that they have not obtained that which alone we could,\r\naccording to the views here presented, consider as success,--a\r\ncoincidence of each with the other. A Chemical System of\r\narrangement, which should bring together, in all cases, the\r\nsubstances which come nearest each other in external properties;--a\r\nNatural-history System, which should be found to arrange bodies in\r\ncomplete accordance with their chemical constitution:--if such\r\nsystems existed, they might, with justice, claim to have succeeded.\r\nTheir agreement would be their verification. The interior and\r\nexterior system are the type and the antitype, and their entire\r\ncorrespondence would establish the mode of interpretation beyond\r\ndoubt. But nothing less than this will satisfy the requisitions of\r\nscience. And when, therefore, the chemical and the natural-history\r\nsystem, though evidently, as I conceive, tending towards each other,\r\nare still far from coming together, it is impossible to allow that\r\neither method has been successful in regard to its proper object.\r\n\r\nBut we may, I think, point out the fallacy of the principles, as well\r\nas the imperfection of the results, of both of those methods. With\r\nregard to that of Berzelius, indeed, the history of the subject\r\nobviously betrays its unsoundness. The electro-positive principle was,\r\nin a very short time after its adoption, proved and acknowledged to be\r\nutterly untenable: what security have we that the electro-negative\r\nelement is {350} more trustworthy? Was not the necessity of an entire\r\nchange of system, a proof that the ground, whatever that was, on which\r\nthe electro-chemical principle was adopted, was an unfounded\r\nassumption? And, in fact, do we not find that the same argument which\r\nwas allowed to be fatal to the First System of Berzelius, applies in\r\nexactly the same manner against the Second? If the electro-positive\r\nelements be often isomorphous, are not the electro-negative elements\r\nsometimes isomorphous also? for instance, the arsenic and phosphoric\r\nacids. But to go further, what _is_ the ground on which the\r\nelectro-chemical arrangement is adopted? Granted that the electrical\r\nrelations of bodies are important; but how do we come to know that\r\nthese relations have anything to do with mineralogy? How does it\r\nappear that on them, principally, depend those external properties\r\nwhich mineralogy must study? How does it appear that because sulphur\r\nis the electro-negative part of one body, and an acid the\r\nelectro-negative part of another, these two elements similarly affect\r\nthe compounds? How does it appear that there is any analogy whatever\r\nin their functions? We allow that the composition must, in _some way_,\r\ndetermine the classified place of the mineral,--but why in _this_ way?\r\n\r\nI do not dwell on the remark which Berzelius himself[51\\15] makes on\r\nNordenskiöld's system;--that it assumes a perfect knowledge of the\r\ncomposition in every case; although, considering the usual\r\ndiscrepancies of analyses of minerals, this objection must make all\r\npure chemical systems useless. But I may observe, that mineralogists\r\nhave not yet determined what characters are sufficiently affixed to\r\ndetermine a species of minerals. We have seen that the ancient\r\nnotion of the composition of a species, has been unsettled by the\r\ndiscovery of isomorphism. The tenet of the constancy of the angle is\r\nrendered doubtful by cases of plesiomorphism. The optical\r\nproperties, which are so closely connected with the crystalline, are\r\nstill so imperfectly known, that they are subject to changes which\r\nappear capricious and arbitrary. Both the chemical and the optical\r\nmineralogists have constantly, of late, found occasion to separate\r\nspecies which had been united, and to bring together those which had\r\nbeen divided. Everything shows that, in this science, we have our\r\nclassification still to begin. The detection of that fixity of\r\ncharacters, on which a right establishment of species must rest, is\r\nnot yet complete, great as the progress is which we have made, by\r\nacquiring a knowledge of the laws of crystallization and of {351}\r\ndefinite chemical constitution. Our ignorance may surprise us; but\r\nit may diminish our surprise to recollect, that the knowledge which\r\nwe seek is that of the laws of the physical constitution of all\r\nbodies whatever; for to us, as mineralogists, all chemical compounds\r\nare minerals.\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\15: _Jahres Bericht._ viii. 188.]\r\n\r\nThe defect of the principle of the natural-history classifiers may be\r\nthus stated:--in studying the external characters of bodies, they take\r\nfor granted that they can, without any other light, discover the\r\nrelative value and importance of those characters. The grouping of\r\nSpecies into a Genus, of Genera into an Order, according to the method\r\nof this school, proceeds by no definite rules, but by a latent talent\r\nof appreciation,--a sort of classifying instinct. But this course\r\ncannot reasonably be expected to lead to scientific truth; for it can\r\nhardly be hoped, by any one who looks at the general course of\r\nscience, that we shall discover the relation between external\r\ncharacters and chemical composition, otherwise than by tracing their\r\nassociation in cases where both are known. It is urged that in other\r\nclassificatory sciences, in botany, for example, we obtain a natural\r\nclassification from external characters without having recourse to any\r\nother source of knowledge. But this is not true in the sense here\r\nmeant. In framing a natural system of botany, we have constantly\r\nbefore our eyes the principles of physiology; and we estimate the\r\nvalue of the characters of a plant by their bearing on its\r\nfunctions,--by their place in its organization. In an unorganic body,\r\nthe chemical constitution is the law of its being; and we shall never\r\nsucceed in framing a science of such bodies but by studiously\r\ndirecting our efforts to the interpretation of that law.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds, then, I conceive, that the bold attempts of Mohs\r\nand of Berzelius to give new forms to mineralogy, cannot be deemed\r\nsuccessful in the manner in which their authors aspired to succeed.\r\nNeither of them can be marked as a permanent reformation of the\r\nscience. I shall not inquire how far they have been accepted by men\r\nof science, for I conceive that their greatest effect has been to\r\npoint out improvements which might be made in mineralogy without\r\ngoing the whole length either of the _pure_ chemical, or of the\r\n_pure_ natural-history system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Return to Mixed Systems with Improvements._\r\n\r\nIN spite of the efforts of the purists, mineralogists returned to\r\nmixed systems of classification; but these systems are much better\r\nthan they were before such efforts were made. {352}\r\n\r\nThe Second System of Berzelius, though not tenable in its rigorous\r\nform, approaches far nearer than any previous system to a complete\r\ncharacter, bringing together like substances in a large portion of\r\nits extent. The System of Mohs also, whether or not unconsciously\r\nswayed by chemical doctrines, forms orders which have a community of\r\nchemical character; thus, the minerals of the order _Haloide_ are\r\nsalts of oxides, and those of the order _Pyrites_ are sulphurets of\r\nmetals. Thus the two methods appear to be converging to a common\r\ncentre; and though we are unable to follow either of them to this\r\npoint of union, we may learn from both in what direction we are to\r\nlook for it. If we regard the best of the pure systems hitherto\r\ndevised as indications of the nature of that system, perfect both as\r\na chemical and as a natural-history system, to which a more complete\r\ncondition of mineralogical knowledge may lead us, we may obtain,\r\neven at present, a tolerably good approximation to a complete\r\nclassification; and such a one, if we recollect that it must be\r\nimperfect, and is to be held as provisional only, may be of no small\r\nvalue and use to us.\r\n\r\nThe best of the mixed systems produced by this compromise again\r\ncomes from Freiberg, and was published by Professor Naumann in 1828.\r\nMost of his orders have both a chemical character and great external\r\nresemblances. Thus his _Haloides_, divided into _Unmetallic_ and\r\n_Metallic_, and these again into _Hydrous_ and _Anhydrous_, give\r\ngood natural groups. The most difficult minerals to arrange in all\r\nsystems are the siliceous ones. These M. Naumann calls _Silicides_,\r\nand subdivides them into _Metallic_, _Unmetallic_, and _Amphoteric_\r\nor mixed; and again, into _Hydrous_ and _Anhydrous_. Such a system\r\nis at least a good basis for future researches; and this is, as we\r\nhave said, all that we can at present hope for. And when we\r\nrecollect that the natural-history principle of classification has\r\nbegun, as we have already seen, to make its appearance in our\r\ntreatises of chemistry, we cannot doubt that some progress is making\r\ntowards the object which I have pointed out. But we know not yet how\r\nfar we are from the end. The combination of chemical,\r\ncrystallographical, physical and optical properties into some lofty\r\ngeneralization, is probably a triumph reserved for future and\r\ndistant years.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--The history of Mineralogy, both in its successes and\r\nby its failures, teaches us this lesson;--that in the sciences of\r\nclassification, the establishment of the fixity of characters, and\r\nthe discovery of such characters as are fixed, are steps of the\r\nfirst importance in the progress of these sciences. The recollection\r\nof this maxim may aid us in {353} shaping our course through the\r\nhistory of other sciences of this kind; in which, from the extent of\r\nthe subject, and the mass of literature belonging to it, we might at\r\nfirst almost despair of casting the history into distinct epochs and\r\nperiods. To the most prominent of such sciences, Botany, I now\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{355}}\r\nBOOK XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CLASSIFICATORY SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOF\r\nSYSTEMATIC BOTANY AND ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . . . .

One of the reasons of this resemblance in the fortunes\r\nof two studies so widely dissimilar, is to be found in a simplicity\r\nof principle which they have in common; the ideas of Likeness and\r\nDifference, on which the knowledge of plants depends, are, like the\r\nideas of Space and Time, which are the foundation of astronomy,\r\nreadily apprehended with clearness and precision, even without any\r\npeculiar culture of the intellect. But another reason why, in the\r\nhistory of Botany, as in that of Astronomy, the progress of\r\nknowledge forms an unbroken line from the earliest times, is\r\nprecisely the great difference of the kind of knowledge which has\r\nbeen attained in the two cases. In Astronomy, the discovery of\r\ngeneral truths began at an early period of civilization; in Botany,\r\nit has hardly yet begun; and thus, in each of these departments of\r\nstudy, the lore of the ancient is homogeneous with that of the\r\nmodern times, though in the one case it is science, in the other,\r\nthe absence of science, which pervades all ages. The resemblance of\r\nthe form of their history arises from the diversity of their\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nI shall not here dwell further upon this subject, but proceed to\r\ntrace rapidly the progress of _Systematic Botany_, as the\r\nclassificatory science is usually denominated, when it is requisite\r\nto distinguish between that and Physiological Botany. My own\r\nimperfect acquaintance with this study admonishes me not to venture\r\ninto its details, further than my purpose absolutely requires. I\r\ntrust that, by taking my views principally from writers who are\r\ngenerally allowed to possess the best insight into the science, I\r\nmay be able to draw the larger features of its history with\r\ntolerable correctness; and if I succeed in this, I shall attain an\r\nobject of great importance in my general scheme. {358}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIMAGINARY KNOWLEDGE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE apprehension of such differences and resemblances as those by\r\nwhich we group together and discriminate the various kinds of plants\r\nand animals, and the appropriation of words to mark and convey the\r\nresulting notions, must be presupposed, as essential to the very\r\nbeginning of human knowledge. In whatever manner we imagine man to\r\nbe placed on the earth by his Creator, these processes must be\r\nconceived to be, as our Scriptures represent them, contemporaneous\r\nwith the first exertion of reason, and the first use of speech. If\r\nwe were to indulge ourselves in framing a hypothetical account of\r\nthe origin of language, we should probably assume as the\r\nfirst-formed words, those which depend on the visible likeness or\r\nunlikeness of objects; and should arrange as of subsequent\r\nformation, those terms which imply, in the mind, acts of wider\r\ncombination and higher abstraction. At any rate, it is certain that\r\nthe names of the kinds of vegetables and animals are very abundant\r\neven in the most uncivilized stages of man's career. Thus we are\r\ninformed[1\\16] that the inhabitants of New Zealand have a distinct\r\nname of every tree and plant in their island, of which there are six\r\nor seven hundred or more different kinds. In the accounts of the\r\nrudest tribes, in the earliest legends, poetry, and literature of\r\nnations, pines and oaks, roses and violets, the olive and the vine,\r\nand the thousand other productions of the earth, have a place, and\r\nare spoken of in a manner which assumes, that in such kinds of\r\nnatural objects, permanent and infallible distinctions had been\r\nobserved and universally recognized.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\16: Yate's _New Zealand_, p. 238.]\r\n\r\nFor a long period, it was not suspected that any ambiguity or\r\nconfusion could arise from the use of such terms; and when such\r\ninconveniences did occur, (as even in early times they did,) men\r\nwere far from divining that the proper remedy was the construction\r\nof a science of classification. The loose and insecure terms of the\r\nlanguage of common life retained their place in botany, long after\r\ntheir {359} defects were severely felt: for instance, the vague and\r\nunscientific distinction of vegetables into _trees_, _shrubs_, and\r\n_herbs_, kept its ground till the time of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nWhile it was thus imagined that the identification of a plant, by\r\nmeans of its name, might properly be trusted to the common\r\nuncultured faculties of the mind, and to what we may call the\r\ninstinct of language, all the attention and study which were\r\nbestowed on such objects, were naturally employed in learning and\r\nthinking upon such circumstances respecting them as were supplied by\r\nany of the common channels through which knowledge and opinion flow\r\ninto men's minds.\r\n\r\nThe reader need hardly be reminded that in the earlier periods of\r\nman's mental culture, he acquires those opinions on which he loves\r\nto dwell, not by the exercise of observation subordinate to reason;\r\nbut, far more, by his fancy and his emotions, his love of the\r\nmarvellous, his hopes and fears. It cannot surprise us, therefore,\r\nthat the earliest lore concerning plants which we discover in the\r\nrecords of the past, consists of mythological legends, marvellous\r\nrelations, and extraordinary medicinal qualities. To the lively\r\nfancy of the Greeks, the Narcissus, which bends its head over the\r\nstream, was originally a youth who in such an attitude became\r\nenamored of his own beauty: the hyacinth,[2\\16] on whose petals the\r\nnotes of grief were traced (A I, A I), recorded the sorrow of Apollo\r\nfor the death of his favorite Hyacinthus: the beautiful lotus of\r\nIndia,[3\\16] which floats with its splendid flower on the surface of\r\nthe water, is the chosen seat of the goddess Lackshmi, the daughter\r\nof Ocean.[4\\16] In Egypt, too,[5\\16] Osiris swam on a lotus-leaf and\r\nHarpocrates was cradled in one. The lotus-eaters of Homer lost\r\nimmediately their love of home. Every one knows how easy it would be\r\nto accumulate such tales of wonder or religion.\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\16: Lilium martagon.\r\n  Ipse suos gemitus foliis inscribit et A I, A I,\r\n  Flos habet inscriptum funestaque litera ducta est.--OVID.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\16: Nelumbium speciosum.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\16: Sprengel, _Geschichte der Botanik_, i. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\16: Ib. i. 28.]\r\n\r\nThose who attended to the effects of plants, might discover in them\r\nsome medicinal properties, and might easily imagine more; and when\r\nthe love of the marvellous was added to the hope of health, it is\r\neasy to believe that men would be very credulous. We need not dwell\r\nupon the examples of this. In Pliny's Introduction to that book of\r\nhis {360} Natural History which treats of the medicinal virtues of\r\nplants, he says,[6\\16] \"Antiquity was so much struck with the\r\nproperties of herbs, that it affirmed things incredible. Xanthus,\r\nthe historian, says, that a man killed by a dragon, will be restored\r\nto life by an herb which he calls _balin_; and that Thylo, when\r\nkilled by a dragon, was recovered by the same plant. Democritus\r\nasserted, and Theophrastus believed, that there was an herb, at the\r\ntouch of which, the wedge which the woodman had driven into a tree\r\nwould leap out again. Though we cannot credit these stories, most\r\npersons believe that almost anything might be effected by means of\r\nherbs, if their virtues were fully known.\" How far from a reasonable\r\nestimate of the reality of such virtues were the persons who\r\nentertained this belief we may judge from the many superstitious\r\nobservances which they associated with the gathering and using of\r\nmedicinal plants. Theophrastus speaks of these;[7\\16] \"The\r\ndrug-sellers and the rhizotomists (root-cutters) tell us,\" he says,\r\n\"some things which may be true, but other things which are merely\r\nsolemn quackery;[8\\16] thus they direct us to gather some plants,\r\nstanding from the wind, and with our bodies anointed; some by night,\r\nsome by day, some before the sun falls on them. So far there may be\r\nsomething in their rules. But others are too fantastical and far\r\nfetched. It is, perhaps, not absurd to use a prayer in plucking a\r\nplant; but they go further than this. We are to draw a sword three\r\ntimes round the mandragora, and to cut it looking to the west:\r\nagain, to dance round it, and to use obscene language, as they say\r\nthose who sow cumin should utter blasphemies. Again, we are to draw\r\na line round the black hellebore, standing to the east and praying;\r\nand to avoid an eagle either on the right or on the left; for, say\r\nthey, 'if an eagle be near, the cutter will die in a year.'\"\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\16: Lib. xxv. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\16: _De Plantis_, ix. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\16: Ἐπιτραγῳδοῦντες.]\r\n\r\nThis extract may serve to show the extent to which these\r\nimaginations were prevalent, and the manner in which they were\r\nlooked upon by Theophrastus, our first great botanical author. And\r\nwe may now consider that we have given sufficient attention to these\r\nfables and superstitions, which have no place in the history of the\r\nprogress of real knowledge, except to show the strange chaos of wild\r\nfancies and legends out of which it had to emerge. We proceed to\r\ntrace the history of the knowledge of plants. {361}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUNSYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STEP was made towards the formation of the Science of Plants,\r\nalthough undoubtedly a slight one, as soon as men began to collect\r\ninformation concerning them and their properties, from a love and\r\nreverence for knowledge, independent of the passion for the\r\nmarvellous and the impulse of practical utility. This step was very\r\nearly made. The \"wisdom\" of Solomon, and the admiration which was\r\nbestowed upon it, prove, even at that period, such a working of the\r\nspeculative faculty: and we are told, that among other evidences of\r\nhis being \"wiser than all men,\" \"he spake of trees, from the\r\ncedar-tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth\r\nout of the wall.\"[9\\16] The father of history, Herodotus, shows us\r\nthat a taste for natural history had, in his time, found a place in\r\nthe minds of the Greeks. In speaking of the luxuriant vegetation of\r\nthe Babylonian plain,[10\\16] he is so far from desiring to astonish\r\nmerely, that he says, \"the blades of wheat and barley are full four\r\nfingers wide; but as to the size of the trees which grow from millet\r\nand sesame, though I could mention it, I will not; knowing well that\r\nthose who have not been in that country will hardly believe what I\r\nhave said already.\" He then proceeds to describe some remarkable\r\ncircumstances respecting the fertilization of the date-palms in\r\nAssyria.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\16: 1 Kings iv. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\16: Herod. i. 193.]\r\n\r\nThis curious and active spirit of the Greeks led rapidly, as we have\r\nseen in other instances, to attempts at collecting and systematizing\r\nknowledge on almost every subject: and in this, as in almost every\r\nother department, Aristotle may be fixed upon, as the representative\r\nof the highest stage of knowledge and system which they ever\r\nattained. The vegetable kingdom, like every other province of\r\nnature, was one of the fields of the labors of this universal\r\nphilosopher. But though his other works on natural history have come\r\ndown to us, and are a most valuable monument of the state of such\r\nknowledge in his time, his Treatise on Plants is lost. The book _De\r\nPlantis_ {362} which appears with his name, is an imposture of the\r\nmiddle ages, full of errors and absurdities.[11\\16]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\16: Mirbel, _Botanique_, ii. 505.]\r\n\r\nHis disciple, friend, and successor, Theophrastus of Eresos, is, as\r\nwe have said already, the first great writer on botany whose works\r\nwe possess; and, as may be said in most cases of the first great\r\nwriter, he offers to us a richer store of genuine knowledge and good\r\nsense than all his successors. But we find in him that the Greeks of\r\nhis time, who aspired, as we have said, to collect and _systematize_\r\na body of information on every subject, failed in one half of their\r\nobject, as far as related to the vegetable world. Their attempts at\r\na systematic distribution of plants were altogether futile. Although\r\nAristotle's divisions of the animal kingdom are, even at this day,\r\nlooked upon with admiration by the best naturalists, the\r\narrangements and comparisons of plants which were contrived by\r\nTheophrastus and his successors, have not left the slightest trace\r\nin the modern form of the science; and, therefore, according to our\r\nplan, are of no importance in our history. And thus we can treat all\r\nthe miscellaneous information concerning vegetables which was\r\naccumulated by the whole of this school of writers, in no other way\r\nthan as something antecedent to the first progress towards\r\nsystematic knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe information thus collected by the unsystematic writers is of\r\nvarious kinds; and relates to the economical and medicinal uses of\r\nplants, their habits, mode of cultivation, and many other\r\ncircumstances: it frequently includes some description; but this is\r\nalways extremely imperfect, because the essential conditions of\r\ndescription had not been discovered. Of works composed of materials\r\nso heterogeneous, it can be of little use to produce specimens; but\r\nI may quote a few words from Theophrastus, which may serve to\r\nconnect him with the future history of the science, as bearing upon\r\none of the many problems respecting the identification of ancient\r\nand modern plants. It has been made a question whether the following\r\ndescription does not refer to the potato.[12\\16] He is speaking of\r\nthe differences of roots: \"Some roots,\" he says, \"are still\r\ndifferent from those which have been described; as that of the\r\n_arachidna_[13\\16] plant: for this bears fruit underground as well\r\nas above: the fleshy part sends one thick root deep into the ground,\r\nbut the others, which bear the fruit, are more slender {363} and\r\nhigher up, and ramified. It loves a sandy soil, and has no leaf\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\16: Theoph. i. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\16: Most probably the _Arachnis hypogæa_, or ground-nut.]\r\n\r\nThe books of Aristotle and Theophrastus soon took the place of the\r\nBook of Nature in the attention of the degenerate philosophers who\r\nsucceeded them. A story is told by Strabo[14\\16] concerning the fate\r\nof the works of these great naturalists. In the case of the wars and\r\nchanges which occurred among the successors of Alexander, the heirs\r\nof Theophrastus tried to secure to themselves his books, and those\r\nof his master, by burying them in the ground. There the manuscripts\r\nsuffered much from damp and worms; till Apollonicon, a\r\nbook-collector of those days, purchased them, and attempted, in his\r\nown way, to supply what time had obliterated. When Sylla marched the\r\nRoman troops into Athens, he took possession of the library of\r\nApollonicon; and the works which it contained were soon circulated\r\namong the learned of Rome and Alexandria, who were thus enabled to\r\n_Aristotelize_[15\\16] on botany as on other subjects.\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\16: Strabo, lib. xiii. c. i. § 54.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\16: Ἀριστοτλίζειν.]\r\n\r\nThe library collected by the Attalic kings of Pergamus, and the\r\nAlexandrian Museum, founded and supported by the Ptolemies of Egypt,\r\nrather fostered the commentatorial spirit than promoted the increase\r\nof any real knowledge of nature. The Romans, in this as in other\r\nsubjects, were practical, not speculative. They had, in the times of\r\ntheir national vigor, several writers on agriculture, who were\r\nhighly esteemed; but no author, till we come to Pliny, who dwells on\r\nthe mere knowledge of plants. And even in Pliny, it is easy to\r\nperceive that we have before us a writer who extracted his\r\ninformation principally from books. This remarkable man,[16\\16] in\r\nthe middle of a public and active life, of campaigns and voyages,\r\ncontrived to accumulate, by reading and study, an extraordinary\r\nstore of knowledge of all kinds. So unwilling was he to have his\r\nreading and note-making interrupted, that, even before day-break in\r\nwinter, and from his litter as he travelled, he was wont to dictate\r\nto his amanuensis, who was obliged to preserve his hand from the\r\nnumbness which the cold occasioned, by the use of gloves.[17\\16]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\16: Sprengel, i. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\16: Plin. Jun. Epist. 3, 5.]\r\n\r\nIt has been ingeniously observed, that we may find traces in the\r\nbotanical part of his Natural History, of the errors which this\r\nhurried and broken habit of study produced; and that he appears\r\nfrequently to have had books read to him and to have heard them\r\namiss.[18\\16] Thus, {364} among several other instances,\r\nTheophrastus having said that the plane-tree is in Italy\r\nrare,[19\\16] Pliny, misled by the similarity of the Greek word\r\n(_spanian_, rare), says that the tree occurs in Italy and\r\nSpain.[20\\16] His work has, with great propriety, been called the\r\nEncyclopædia of Antiquity; and, in truth, there are few portions of\r\nthe learning of the times to which it does not refer. Of the\r\nthirty-seven Books of which it consists, no less than sixteen (from\r\nthe twelfth to the twenty-seventh) relate to plants. The information\r\nwhich is collected in these books, is of the most miscellaneous\r\nkind; and the author admits, with little distinction, truth and\r\nerror, useful knowledge and absurd fables. The declamatory style,\r\nand the comprehensive and lofty tone of thought which we have\r\nalready spoken of as characteristic of the Roman writers, are\r\npeculiarly observable in him. The manner of his death is well known:\r\nit was occasioned by the eruption of Vesuvius, A.D. 79, to which, in\r\nhis curiosity, he ventured so near as to be suffocated.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\16: Sprengel, i. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\16: Theoph. iv. 7. Ἔν μὲν γὰρ τῷ Ἀδρίᾳ πλάτανον οὐ φασὶν\r\nεἶναι πλῆν περὶ το Διομήδους ἱερόν, _σπανίαν_ δὲ καὶ ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ πάσῃ]\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\16: Plin. Nat. Hist. xii. 3. Et alias (platanos) fuisse in\r\nItalia, ac nominatim _Hispania_, apud auctores invenitur.]\r\n\r\nPliny's work acquired an almost unlimited authority, as one of the\r\nstandards of botanical knowledge, in the middle ages; but even more\r\nthan his, that of his contemporary, Pedanius Dioscorides, of\r\nAnazarbus in Cilicia. This work, written in Greek, is held by the\r\nbest judges[21\\16] to offer no evidence that the author observed for\r\nhimself. Yet he says expressly in his Preface, that his love of\r\nnatural history, and his military life, have led him into many\r\ncountries, in which he has had opportunity to become acquainted with\r\nthe nature of herbs and trees.[22\\16] He speaks of six hundred\r\nplants, but often indicates only their names and properties, giving\r\nno description by which they can be identified. The main cause of\r\nhis great reputation in subsequent times was, that he says much of\r\nthe medicinal virtues of vegetables.\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\16: Mirbel, 510.]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\16: Sprengel, i. 136.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the ages of darkness and lethargy, when the habit of\r\noriginal thought seems to die away, as the talent of original\r\nobservation had done before. Commentators and mystics succeed to the\r\nphilosophical naturalists of better times. And though a new race,\r\naltogether distinct in blood and character from the Greek,\r\nappropriates to itself the stores of Grecian learning, this movement\r\ndoes not, as might be expected, break the chains of literary\r\nslavery. The Arabs {365} bring, to the cultivation of the science of\r\nthe Greeks, their own oriental habit of submission, their oriental\r\nlove of wonder; and thus, while they swell the herd of commentators\r\nand mystics, they produce no philosopher.\r\n\r\nYet the Arabs discharged an important function in the history of\r\nhuman knowledge,[23\\16] by preserving, and transmitting to more\r\nenlightened times, the intellectual treasures of antiquity. The\r\nunhappy dissensions which took place in the Christian church had\r\nscattered these treasures over the East, at a period much antecedent\r\nto the rise of the Saracen power. In the fifth century, the\r\nadherents of Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, were declared\r\nheretical by the Council of Ephesus (A.D. 431), and driven into\r\nexile. In this manner, many of the most learned and ingenious men of\r\nthe Christian world were removed to the Euphrates, where they formed\r\nthe _Chaldean_ church, erected the celebrated Nestorian school of\r\nEdessa, and gave rise to many offsets from this in various regions.\r\nAlready, in the fifth century, Hibas, Cumas, and Probus, translated\r\nthe writings of Aristotle into Syriac. But the learned Nestorians\r\npaid an especial attention to the art of medicine, and were the most\r\nzealous students of the works of the Greek physicians. At\r\nDjondisabor, in Khusistan, they became an ostensible medical school,\r\nwho distributed academical honors as the result of public\r\ndisputations. The califs of Bagdad heard of the fame and the wisdom\r\nof the doctors of Djondisabor, summoned some of them to Bagdad, and\r\ntook measures for the foundation of a school of learning in that\r\ncity. The value of the skill, the learning, and the virtues of the\r\nNestorians, was so strongly felt, that they were allowed by the\r\nMohammedans the free exercise of the Christian religion, and\r\nintrusted with the conduct of the studies of those of the Moslemin,\r\nwhose education was most cared for. The affinity of the Syriac and\r\nArabic languages made the task of instruction more easy. The\r\nNestorians translated the works of the ancients out of the former\r\ninto the latter language: hence there are still found Arabic\r\nmanuscripts of Dioscorides, with Syriac words in the margin. Pliny\r\nand Aristotle likewise assumed an Arabic dress; and were, as well as\r\nDioscorides, the foundation of instruction in all the Arabian\r\nacademies; of which a great number were established throughout the\r\nSaracen empire, from Bokhara in the remotest east, to Marocco and\r\nCordova in the west. After some time, the Mohammedans themselves\r\nbegan to translate and {366} extract from their Syriac sources; and\r\nat length to write works of their own. And thus arose vast\r\nlibraries, such as that of Cordova, which contained 250,000 volumes.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\16: Sprengel, i. 203.]\r\n\r\nThe Nestorians are stated[24\\16] to have first established among the\r\nArabs those collections of medicinal substances (_Apothecæ_), from\r\nwhich our term _Apothecary_ is taken; and to have written books\r\n(_Dispensatoria_) containing systematic instructions for the\r\nemployment of these medicaments; a word which long continued to be\r\nimplied in the same sense, and which we also retain, though in a\r\nmodified application (_Dispensary_).\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\16: Sprengel, i. 205.]\r\n\r\nThe directors of these collections were supposed to be intimately\r\nacquainted with plants; and yet, in truth, the knowledge of plants\r\nowed but little to them; for the Arabic Dioscorides was the source\r\nand standard of their knowledge. The flourishing commerce of the\r\nArabians, their numerous and distant journeys, made them, no doubt,\r\npractically acquainted with the productions of lands unknown to the\r\nGreeks and Romans. Their Nestorian teachers had established\r\nChristianity even as far as China and Malabar; and their travellers\r\nmention[25\\16] the camphor of Sumatra, the aloe-wood of Socotra near\r\nJava, the tea of China. But they never learned the art of converting\r\ntheir practical into speculative knowledge. They treat of plants\r\nonly in so far as their use in medicine is concerned,[26\\16] and\r\nfollowed Dioscorides in the description, and even in the order of\r\nthe plants, except when they arrange them according to the Arabic\r\nalphabet. With little clearness of view, they often mistake what\r\nthey read:[27\\16] thus when Dioscorides says that _ligusticon_ grows\r\non the _Apennine_, a mountain not far from the _Alps_; Avicenna,\r\nmisled by a resemblance of the Arabic letters, quotes him as saying\r\nthat the plant grows on _Akabis_, a mountain near _Egypt_.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\16: Sprengel, i. 206.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\16: Ib. i. 207.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\16: Ib. i. 211.]\r\n\r\nIt is of little use to enumerate such writers. One of the most noted\r\nof them was Mesuë, physician of the Calif of Kahirah. His work,\r\nwhich was translated into Latin at a later period, was entitled, _On\r\nSimple Medicines_; a title which was common to many medical\r\ntreatises, from the time of Galen in the second century. Indeed, of\r\nthis opposition of _simple_ and _compound_ medicines, we still have\r\ntraces in our language: {367}\r\n    He would ope his leathern scrip,\r\n  And show me _simples_ of a thousand names,\r\n  Telling their strange and vigorous faculties.\r\n          MILTON, _Comus_.\r\n\r\nWhere the subject of our history is so entirely at a stand, it is\r\nunprofitable to dwell on a list of names. The Arabians, small as\r\ntheir science was, were able to instruct the Christians. Their\r\nwritings were translated by learned Europeans, for instance Michael\r\nScot, and Constantine of Africa, a Carthaginian who had lived forty\r\nyears among the Saracens[28\\16] and who died A.D. 1087. Among his\r\nworks, is a Treatise, _De Gradibus_, which contains the Arabian\r\nmedicinal lore. In the thirteenth century occur Encyclopædias, as\r\nthat of Albertus Magnus, and of Vincent of Beauvais; but these\r\ncontain no natural history except traditions and fables. Even the\r\nancient writers were altogether perverted and disfigured. The\r\nDioscorides of the middle ages varied materially from ours.[29\\16]\r\nMonks, merchants, and adventurers travelled far, but knowledge was\r\nlittle increased. Simon of Genoa,[30\\16] a writer on plants in the\r\nfourteenth century, boasts that he perambulated the East in order to\r\ncollect plants. \"Yet in his _Clavis Sanationis_,\" says a modern\r\nbotanical writer,[31\\16] \"we discover no trace of an acquaintance\r\nwith nature. He merely compares the Greek, Arabic, and Latin names\r\nof plants, and gives their medicinal effect after his\r\npredecessors:\"--so little true is it, that the use of the senses\r\nalone necessarily leads to real knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\16: Sprengel, i. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\16: Ib. i. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\16: Ib. i. 241.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\16: Ib. ib.]\r\n\r\nThough the growing activity of thought in Europe, and the revived\r\nacquaintance with the authors of Greece in their genuine form, were\r\ngradually dispelling the intellectual clouds of the middle ages, yet\r\nduring the fifteenth century, botany makes no approach to a\r\nscientific form. The greater part of the literature of this subject\r\nconsisted of Herbals, all of which were formed on the same plan, and\r\nappeared under titles such as _Hortus_, or _Ortus Sanitatis_. There\r\nare, for example, three[32\\16] such German Herbals, with woodcuts,\r\nwhich date about 1490. But an important peculiarity in these works\r\nis that they contain some indigenous species placed side by side\r\nwith the old ones. In 1516, _The Grete Herbal_ was published in\r\nEngland, also with woodcuts. It contains an account of more than\r\nfour hundred vegetables, and their {368} products; of which one\r\nhundred and fifty are English, and are no way distinguished from the\r\nexotics by the mode in which they are inserted in the work.\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\16: Augsburg, 1488. Mainz, 1491. Lubec, 1492.]\r\n\r\nWe shall see, in the next chapter, that when the intellect of Europe\r\nbegan really to apply itself to the observation of nature, the\r\nprogress towards genuine science soon began to be visible, in this\r\nas in other subjects; but before this tendency could operate freely,\r\nthe history of botany was destined to show, in another instance, how\r\nmuch more grateful to man, even when roused to intelligence and\r\nactivity, is the study of tradition than the study of nature. When\r\nthe scholars of Europe had become acquainted with the genuine works\r\nof the ancients in the original languages, the pleasure and\r\nadmiration which they felt, led them to the most zealous endeavors\r\nto illustrate and apply what they read. They fell into the error of\r\nsupposing that the plants described by Theophrastus, Dioscorides,\r\nPliny, must be those which grew in their own fields. And thus\r\nRuellius,[33\\16] a French physician, who only travelled in the\r\nenvirons of Paris and Picardy, imagined that he found there the\r\nplants of Italy and Greece. The originators of genuine botany in\r\nGermany, Brunfels and Tragus (Bock), committed the same mistake; and\r\nhence arose the misapplication of classical names to many genera.\r\nThe labors of many other learned men took the same direction, of\r\ntreating the ancient writers as if they alone were the sources of\r\nknowledge and truth.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\16: _De Natura Stirpium_, 1536.]\r\n\r\nBut the philosophical spirit of Europe was already too vigorous to\r\nallow this superstitious erudition to exercise a lasting sway.\r\nLeonicenus, who taught at Ferrara till he was almost a hundred years\r\nold, and died in 1524,[34\\16] disputed, with great freedom, the\r\nauthority of the Arabian writers, and even of Pliny. He saw, and\r\nshowed by many examples, how little Pliny himself knew of nature,\r\nand how many errors he had made or transmitted. The same\r\nindependence of thought with regard to other ancient writers, was\r\nmanifested by other scholars. Yet the power of ancient authority\r\nmelted away but gradually. Thus Antonius Brassavola, who established\r\non the banks of the Po the first botanical garden of modern times,\r\npublished in 1536, his _Examen omnium Simplicium Medicamentorum_;\r\nand, as Cuvier says,[35\\16] though he studied plants in nature, his\r\nbook (written in the {369} Platonic form of dialogue), has still the\r\ncharacter of a commentary on the ancients.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\16: Sprengel, i. 252.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\16: _Hist. des Sc. Nat._ partie ii. 169.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans appear to have been the first to liberate themselves\r\nfrom this thraldom, and to publish works founded mainly on actual\r\nobservation. The first of the botanists who had this great merit is\r\nOtho Brunfels of Mentz, whose work, _Herbarum Vivæ Icones_, appeared\r\nin 1530. It consists of two volumes in folio, with wood-cuts; and in\r\n1532, a German edition was published. The plants which it contains\r\nare given without any arrangement, and thus he belongs to the period\r\nof unsystematic knowledge. Yet the progress towards the formation of\r\na system manifested itself so immediately in the series of German\r\nbotanists to which he belongs, that we might with almost equal\r\npropriety transfer him to the history of that progress; to which we\r\nnow proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF A SYSTEM OF ARRANGEMENT OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Prelude to the Epoch of Cæsalpinus._\r\n\r\nTHE arrangement of plants in the earliest works was either\r\narbitrary, or according to their use, or some other extraneous\r\ncircumstance, as in Pliny. This and the division of vegetables by\r\nDioscorides into _aromatic_, _alimentary_, _medicinal_, _vinous_,\r\nis, as will be easily seen, a merely casual distribution. The\r\nArabian writers, and those of the middle ages, showed still more\r\nclearly their insensibility to the nature of system, by adopting an\r\nalphabetical arrangement; which was employed also in the Herbals of\r\nthe sixteenth century. Brunfels, as we have said, adopted no\r\nprinciple of order; nor did his successor, Fuchs. Yet the latter\r\nwriter urged his countrymen to put aside their Arabian and barbarous\r\nLatin doctors, and to observe the vegetable kingdom for themselves;\r\nand he himself set the example of doing this, examined plants with\r\nzeal and accuracy, and made above fifteen hundred drawings of\r\nthem.[36\\16] {370}\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\16: His _Historia Stirpium_ was published at Basil in 1542.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of representing plants in any useful way by means of\r\ndrawings, is greater, perhaps, than it at first appears. So long as\r\nno distinction was made of the importance of different organs of the\r\nplant, a picture representing merely the obvious general appearance\r\nand larger parts, was of comparatively small value. Hence we are not\r\nto wonder at the slighting manner in which Pliny speaks of such\r\nrecords. \"Those who gave such pictures of plants,\" he says,\r\n\"Crateuas, Dionysius, Metrodorus, have shown nothing clearly, except\r\nthe difficulty of their undertaking. A picture may be mistaken, and\r\nis changed and disfigured by copyists; and, without these\r\nimperfections, it is not enough to represent the plant in one state,\r\nsince it has four different aspects in the four seasons of the year.\"\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of the habit of exact drawing, especially among the\r\ncountrymen of Albert Durer and Lucas Cranach, and the invention of\r\nwood-cuts and copper-plates, remedied some of these defects.\r\nMoreover, the conviction gradually arose in men's minds that the\r\nstructure of the flower and the fruit are the most important\r\ncircumstances in fixing the identity of the plant. Theophrastus\r\nspeaks with precision of the organs which he describes, but these\r\nare principally the leaves, roots, and stems. Fuchs uses the term\r\n_apices_ for the anthers, and _gluma_ for the blossom of grasses,\r\nthus showing that he had noticed these parts as generally present.\r\n\r\nIn the next writer whom we have to mention, we find some traces of a\r\nperception of the real resemblances of plants beginning to appear.\r\nIt is impossible to explain the progress of such views without\r\nassuming in the reader some acquaintance with plants; but a very few\r\nwords may suffice to convey the requisite notions. Even in plants\r\nwhich most commonly come in our way, we may perceive instances of\r\nthe resemblances of which we speak. Thus, Mint, Marjoram, Basil,\r\nSage, Lavender, Thyme, Dead-nettle, and many other plants, have a\r\ntubular flower, of which the mouth is divided into two lips; hence\r\nthey are formed into a family, and termed _Labiatæ_. Again, the\r\nStock, the Wall-flower, the Mustard, the Cress, the Lady-smock, the\r\nShepherd's purse, have, among other similarities, their blossoms\r\nwith four petals arranged crosswise; these are all of the order\r\n_Cruciferæ_. Other flowers, apparently more complex, still resemble\r\neach other, as Daisy. Marigold, Aster, and Chamomile; these belong\r\nto the order _Compositæ_. And though the members of each such family\r\nmay differ widely in their larger parts, their stems and leaves, the\r\nclose study of nature leads the botanist irresistibly to consider\r\ntheir resemblances as {371} occupying a far more important place\r\nthan their differences. It is the general establishment of this\r\nconviction and its consequences which we have now to follow.\r\n\r\nThe first writer in whom we find the traces of an arrangement\r\ndepending upon these natural resemblances, is Hieronymus Tragus,\r\n(Jerom Bock,) a laborious German botanist, who, in 1551, published a\r\nherbal. In this work, several of the species included in those\r\nnatural families to which we have alluded,[37\\16] as for instance\r\nthe Labiatæ, the Cruciferæ, the Compositæ, are for the most part\r\nbrought together; and thus, although with many mistakes as to such\r\nconnexions, a new principle of order is introduced into the subject.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\16: Sprengel, i. 270.]\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the development of such principles of natural order, it\r\nis necessary to recollect that the principles lead to an assemblage\r\nof divisions and groups, successively subordinate, the lower to the\r\nhigher, like the brigades, regiments, and companies of an army, or\r\nthe provinces, towns, and parishes of a kingdom. Species are\r\nincluded in Genera, Genera in Families or Orders, and orders in\r\nClasses. The perception that there is some connexion among the\r\nspecies of plants, was the first essential step; the detection of\r\ndifferent marks and characters which should give, on the one hand,\r\nlimited groups, on the other, comprehensive divisions, were other\r\nhighly important parts of this advance. To point out every\r\nsuccessive movement in this progress would be a task of extreme\r\ndifficulty, but we may note, as the most prominent portions of it,\r\nthe establishment of the groups which immediately include Species,\r\nthat is, _the formation of Genera_; and the invention of a method\r\nwhich should distribute into consistent and distinct divisions the\r\nwhole vegetable kingdom, that is, _the construction of a System_.\r\n\r\nTo the second of these two steps we have no difficulty in assigning\r\nits proper author. It belongs to Cæsalpinus, and marks the first\r\ngreat epoch of this science. It is less easy to state to what\r\nbotanist is due the establishment of Genera; yet we may justly\r\nassign the greater part of the merit of this invention, as is\r\nusually done, to Conrad Gessner of Zurich. This eminent naturalist,\r\nafter publishing his great work on animals, died[38\\16] of the\r\nplague in 1565, at the age of forty-nine, while he was preparing to\r\npublish a History of Plants, a sequel to his History of Animals. The\r\nfate of the work thus left {372} unfinished was remarkable. It fell\r\ninto the hands of his pupil, Gaspard Wolf, who was to have published\r\nit, but wanting leisure for the office, sold it to Joachim\r\nCamerarius, a physician and botanist of Nuremberg, who made use of\r\nthe engravings prepared by Gessner, in an Epitome which he published\r\nin 1586. The text of Gessner's work, after passing through various\r\nhands, was published in 1754 under the title of _Gessneri Opera\r\nBotanica per duo Sæcula desiderata, &c._, but is very incomplete.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\16: Cuvier, _Leçons sur l'Hist. des Sciences Naturelles_,\r\npartie ii. p. 193.]\r\n\r\nThe imperfect state in which Gessner left his botanical labors,\r\nmakes it necessary to seek the evidence of his peculiar views in\r\nscattered passages of his correspondence and other works. One of his\r\ngreat merits was, that he saw the peculiar importance of the flower\r\nand fruit as affording the characters by which the affinities of\r\nplants were to be detected; and that he urged this view upon his\r\ncontemporaries. His plates present to us, by the side of each plant,\r\nits flower and its fruit, carefully engraved. And in his\r\ncommunications with his botanical correspondents, he repeatedly\r\ninsists on these parts. Thus[39\\16] in 1565 he writes to Zuinger\r\nconcerning some foreign plants which the latter possessed: \"Tell me\r\nif your plants have fruit and flower, as well as stalk and leaves,\r\nfor those are of much the greater consequence. By these three\r\nmarks,--flower, fruit, and seed,--I find that Saxifraga and\r\nConsolida Regalis are related to Aconite.\" These characters, derived\r\nfrom the _fructification_ (as the assemblage of flower and fruit is\r\ncalled), are the means by which genera are established, and hence,\r\nby the best botanists, Gessner is declared to be the inventor of\r\ngenera.[40\\16] {373}\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\16: _Epistolæ_, fol. 113 a; see also fol. 65 b.]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\16: Haller, _Biblio Botanica_, i. 284.

Nat._ 2^e p^e, p. 193), after speaking to\r\nthe same effect, \"Il fit voir encore que toutes les plantes qui ont\r\ndes fleurs et des fruits semblables se ressemblent par leurs\r\npropriétés, et que quand on rapproche ces plantes on obtient ainsi une\r\nclassification naturelle.\" I do not know if he here refers to any\r\nparticular passages of Gessner's work.]\r\n\r\nThe labors of Gessner in botany, both on account of the unfinished\r\nstate in which he left the application of his principles, and on\r\naccount of the absence of any principles manifestly applicable to\r\nthe whole extent of the vegetable kingdom, can only be considered as\r\na prelude to the epoch in which those defects were supplied. To that\r\nepoch we now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Epoch of Cæsalpinus.--Formation of a System of\r\nArrangement._\r\n\r\nIF any one were disposed to question whether Natural History truly\r\nbelongs to the domain of Inductive Science;--whether it is to be\r\nprosecuted by the same methods, and requires the same endowments of\r\nmind as those which lead to the successful cultivation of the\r\nPhysical Sciences,--the circumstances under which Botany has made\r\nits advance appear fitted to remove such doubts. The first decided\r\nstep in this study was merely the construction of a classification\r\nof its subjects. We shall, I trust, be able to show that such a\r\nclassification includes, in reality, the establishment of one\r\ngeneral principle, and leads to more. But without here dwelling on\r\nthis point, it is worth notice that the person to whom we owe this\r\nclassification, Andreas Cæsalpinus of Arezzo, was one of the most\r\nphilosophical men of his time, profoundly skilled in the\r\nAristotelian lore which was then esteemed, yet gifted with courage\r\nand sagacity which enabled him to weigh the value of the Peripatetic\r\ndoctrines, to reject what seemed error, and to look onwards to a\r\nbetter philosophy. \"How are we to understand,\" he inquires, \"that we\r\nmust proceed from universals to particulars (as Aristotle directs),\r\nwhen particulars are better known?\"[41\\16] Yet he treats the Master\r\nwith deference, and, as has been observed,[42\\16] we see in his\r\ngreat botanical work deep traces of the best features of the\r\nAristotelian school, logic and method; and, indeed, in this work he\r\nfrequently refers to his _Quæstiones Peripateticæ_. His book,\r\nentitled _De Plantis libri_ xvi. appeared at Florence in 1583. The\r\naspect under which his task presented itself to his mind appears to\r\nme to possess so much interest, that I will transcribe a few of his\r\nreflections. After speaking of the splendid multiplicity of the\r\nproductions of nature, and the confusion which has hitherto\r\nprevailed among writers on plants, {374} the growing treasures of\r\nthe botanical world; he adds,[43\\16] \"In this immense multitude of\r\nplants, I see that want which is most felt in any other unordered\r\ncrowd: if such an assemblage be not arranged into brigades like an\r\narmy, all must be tumult and fluctuation. And this accordingly\r\nhappens in the treatment of plants: for the mind is overwhelmed by\r\nthe confused accumulation of things, and thus arise endless mistake\r\nand angry altercation.\" He then states his general view, which, as\r\nwe shall see, was adopted by his successors. \"_Since all science\r\nconsists in the collection of similar, and the distinction of\r\ndissimilar things_, and since the consequence of this is a\r\ndistribution into genera and species, which are to be natural\r\nclasses governed by real differences, I have attempted to execute\r\nthis task in the whole range of plants;--ut si quid pro ingenii mei\r\ntenuitate in hujusmodi studio profecerim, ad communem utilitatem\r\nproferam.\" We see here how clearly he claims for himself the credit\r\nof being the first to execute this task of arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\16: _Quæstiones Peripateticæ_, (1569,) lib. i. quæst. i.]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\16: Cuvier, p. 198.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\16: Dedicatio, a 2.]\r\n\r\nAfter certain preparatory speculations, he says,[44\\16] \"Let us now\r\nendeavor to mark the kinds of plants by essential circumstances in\r\nthe fructification.\" He then observes, \"In the constitution of\r\norgans three things are mainly important--the number, the position,\r\nthe figure.\" And he then proceeds to exemplify this: \"Some have\r\nunder one flower, ONE _seed_, as _Amygdala_, or ONE\r\nseed-_receptacle_, as _Rosa_; or TWO _seeds_, as _Ferularia_, or TWO\r\nseed-_receptacles_, as _Nasturtium_; or three, as the _Tithymalum_\r\nkind have THREE _seeds_, the _Bulbaceæ_ THREE _receptacles_; or\r\nfour, as _Marrubium_, FOUR _seeds_, _Siler_ FOUR _receptacles_; or\r\nmore, as _Cicoraceæ_, and _Acanaceæ_ have MORE _seeds_, _Pinus_,\r\nMORE _receptacles_.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\16: Lib. i. c. 13, 14.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we have here ten classes made out by means\r\nof number alone, added to the consideration of whether the seed is\r\nalone in its covering, as in a cherry, or contained in a receptacle\r\nwith several others, as in a berry, pod, or capsule. Several of\r\nthese divisions are, however, further subdivided according to other\r\ncircumstances, and especially according as the vital part of the\r\nseed, which he called the heart (_cor_[45\\16]), is situated in the\r\nupper or lower part of the seed. As our object here is only to\r\nindicate the principle of the method of Cæsalpinus, I need not\r\nfurther dwell on the details, and still less on the defects by which\r\nit is disfigured, as, for instance, the retention of the old\r\ndistinction of Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs. {375}\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\16: _Corculum_, of Linnæus.]\r\n\r\nTo some persons it may appear that this arbitrary distribution of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, according to the number of parts of a\r\nparticular kind, cannot deserve to be spoken of as a great\r\ndiscovery. And if, indeed, the distribution had been arbitrary, this\r\nwould have been true; the real merit of this and of every other\r\nsystem is, that while it is artificial in its form, it is natural in\r\nits results. The plants which are associated by the arrangement of\r\nCæsalpinus, are those which have the closest resemblances in the\r\nmost essential points. Thus, as Linnæus says, though the first in\r\nattempting to form natural orders, he observed as many as the most\r\nsuccessful of later writers. Thus his _Legumina_[46\\16] correspond\r\nto the natural order _Leguminosæ_; his _genus Ferulaceum_[47\\16] to\r\nthe _Umbellatæ_; his _Bulbaceæ_[48\\16] to _Liliaceæ_; his\r\n_Anthemides_[49\\16] to the _Compositæ_; in like manner, the\r\n_Boragineæ_ are brought together,[50\\16] and the _Labiatæ_. That\r\nsuch assemblages are produced by the application of his principles,\r\nis a sufficient evidence that they have their foundation in the\r\ngeneral laws of the vegetable world. If this had not been the case,\r\nthe mere application of number or figure alone as a standard of\r\narrangement, would have produced only intolerable anomalies. If, for\r\ninstance, Cæsalpinus had arranged plants by the number of flowers on\r\nthe same stalk, he would have separated individuals of the same\r\nspecies; if he had distributed them according to the number of\r\nleaflets which compose the leaves, he would have had to place far\r\nasunder different species of the same genus. Or, as he himself\r\nsays,[51\\16] \"If we make one genus of those which have a round root,\r\nas Rapum, Aristolochia, Cyclaminus, Aton, we shall separate from\r\nthis genus those which most agree with it, as Napum and Raphanum,\r\nwhich resemble Rapum, and the long Aristolochia, which resembles the\r\nround; while we shall join the most remote kinds, for the nature of\r\nCyclaminus and Rapum is altogether diverse in all other respects. Or\r\nif we attend to the differences of stalk, so as to make one genus of\r\nthose which have a naked stalk, as the Junci, Cæpe, Aphacæ, along\r\nwith Cicoraceæ, Violæ, we shall still connect the most unlike\r\nthings, and disjoin the closest affinities. And if we note the\r\ndifferences of leaves, or even flowers, we fall into the same\r\ndifficulty; for many plants very different in kind have leaves very\r\nsimilar, as Polygonum and Hypericum, Ernea and Sesamois, Apium and\r\nRanunculus; and plants of the same genus have sometimes very\r\ndifferent {376} leaves, as the several species of Ranunculus and of\r\nLactuca. Nor will color or shape of the flowers help us better; for\r\nwhat has Vitis in common with Œnanthe, except the resemblance of the\r\nflower?\" He then goes on to say, that if we seek a too close\r\ncoincidence of all the characters we shall have no Species; and thus\r\nshows us that he had clearly before his view the difficulty, which\r\nhe had to attack, and which it is his glory to have overcome, that\r\nof constructing Natural Orders.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\16: Lib. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\16: Lib. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\16: Lib. x.]\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\16: Lib. xii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\16: Lib. xi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\16: Lib. i. cap. xii. p. 25.]\r\n\r\nBut as the principles of Cæsalpinus are justified, on the one hand,\r\nby their leading to _Natural Orders_, they are recommended on the\r\nother by their producing a _System_ which applies through the whole\r\nextent of the vegetable kingdom. The parts from which he takes his\r\ncharacters must occur in all flowering-plants, for all such plants\r\nhave seeds. And these seeds, if not very numerous for each flower,\r\nwill be of a certain definite number and orderly distribution. And\r\nthus every plant will fall into one part or other of the same system.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to point out, in this induction of Cæsalpinus,\r\nthe two elements which we have so often declared must occur in all\r\ninductive processes; the exact acquaintance with _facts_, and the\r\ngeneral and applicable _ideas_ by which these facts are brought\r\ntogether. Cæsalpinus was no mere dealer in intellectual relations or\r\nlearned traditions, but a laborious and persevering collector of\r\nplants and of botanical knowledge. \"For many years,\" he says in his\r\nDedication, \"I have been pursuing my researches in various regions,\r\nhabitually visiting the places in which grew the various kinds of\r\nherbs, shrubs, and trees; I have been assisted by the labors of many\r\nfriends, and by gardens established for the public benefit, and\r\ncontaining foreign plants collected from the most remote regions.\"\r\nHe here refers to the first garden directed to the public study of\r\nBotany, which was that of Pisa,[52\\16] instituted in 1543, by order\r\nof the Grand Duke Cosmo the First. The management of it was confided\r\nfirst to Lucas Ghini, and afterwards to Cæsalpinus. He had collected\r\nalso a herbarium of dried plants, which he calls the rudiment of his\r\nwork. \"Tibi enim,\" he says, in his dedication to Francis Medici,\r\nGrand Duke of Etruria, \"apud quem extat ejus rudimentum ex plantis\r\nlibro agglutinatis a me compositum.\" And, throughout, he speaks with\r\nthe most familiar and vivid acquaintance of the various vegetables\r\nwhich he describes.\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\16: Cuv. 187.]\r\n\r\nBut Cæsalpinus also possessed fixed and general views concerning the\r\nrelation and functions of the parts of plants, and ideas of symmetry\r\n{377} and system; without which, as we see in other botanists of his\r\nand succeeding times, the mere accumulation of a knowledge of\r\ndetails does not lead to any advance in science. We have already\r\nmentioned his reference to general philosophical principles, both of\r\nthe Peripatetics and of his own. The first twelve chapters of his\r\nwork are employed in explaining the general structure of plants, and\r\nespecially that point to which he justly attaches so much\r\nimportance, the results of the different situation of the _cor_ or\r\n_corculum_ of the seed. He shows[53\\16] that if we take the root, or\r\nstem, or leaves, or blossom, as our guide in classification, we\r\nshall separate plants obviously alike, and approximate those which\r\nhave merely superficial resemblances. And thus we see that he had in\r\nhis mind ideas of fixed resemblance and symmetrical distribution,\r\nwhich he sedulously endeavored to apply to plants; while his\r\nacquaintance with the vegetable kingdom enabled him to see in what\r\nmanner these ideas were not, and in what manner they were, really\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\16: Lib. i. cap. xii.]\r\n\r\nThe great merit and originality of Cæsalpinus have been generally\r\nallowed, by the best of the more modern writers on Botany. Linnæus\r\ncalls him one of the founders of the science; \"Primus verus\r\nsystematicus;\"[54\\16] and, as if not satisfied with the expression\r\nof his admiration in prose, hangs a poetical garland on the tomb of\r\nhis hero. The following distich concludes his remarks on this\r\nwriter:\r\n  Quisquis hic extiterit primos concedet honores\r\n  Cæsalpine tibi; primaque serta dabit:\r\nand similar language of praise has been applied to him by the best\r\nbotanists up to Cuvier,[55\\16] who justly terms his book \"a work of\r\ngenius.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\16: _Philosoph. Bot._ p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\16: Cuv. _Hist._ 193.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the great advance made in this science by Cæsalpinus, is\r\nmost strongly shown by this; that no one appeared, to follow the\r\npath which he had opened to system and symmetry, for nearly a\r\ncentury. Moreover, when the progress of this branch of knowledge was\r\nresumed, his next successor, Morison, did not choose to acknowledge\r\nthat he had borrowed so much from so old a writer; and thus, hardly\r\nmentions his name, although he takes advantage of his labors, and\r\neven transcribes his words without acknowledgement, as I shall show.\r\nThe pause between the great invention of Cæsalpinus, and its natural\r\nsequel, the developement and improvement of his method, is so\r\nmarked, that I {378} will, in order to avoid too great an\r\ninterruption of chronological order, record some of its\r\ncircumstances in a separate section.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Stationary Interval._\r\n\r\nTHE method of Cæsalpinus was not, at first, generally adopted. It\r\nhad, indeed, some disadvantages. Employed in drawing the\r\nboundary-lines of the larger divisions of the vegetable kingdom, he\r\nhad omitted those smaller groups, Genera, which were both most\r\nobvious to common botanists, and most convenient in the description\r\nand comparison of plants. He had also neglected to give the Synonyms\r\nof other authors for the plants spoken of by him; an appendage to\r\nbotanical descriptions, which the increase of botanical information\r\nand botanical books had now rendered indispensable. And thus it\r\nhappened, that a work, which must always be considered as forming a\r\ngreat epoch in the science to which it refers, was probably little\r\nread, and in a short time could be treated as if it were quite\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the science was gradually improved in its details.\r\nClusius, or Charles de l'Ecluse, first taught botanists to describe\r\nwell. \"Before him,\" says Mirbel,[56\\16] \"the descriptions were\r\ndiffuse, obscure, indistinct; or else concise, incomplete, vague.\r\nClusius introduced exactitude, precision, neatness, elegance,\r\nmethod: he says nothing superfluous; he omits nothing necessary.\" He\r\ntravelled over great part of Europe, and published various works on\r\nthe more rare of the plants which he had seen. Among such plants, we\r\nmay note now one well known, the potato; which he describes as being\r\ncommonly used in Italy in 1586;[57\\16] thus throwing doubt, at\r\nleast, on the opinion which ascribes the first introduction of it\r\ninto Europe to Sir Walter Raleigh, on his return from Virginia,\r\nabout the same period. As serving to illustrate, both this point,\r\nand the descriptive style of Clusius, I quote, in a note, his\r\ndescription of the flower of this plant.[58\\16] {379}\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\16: _Physiol. Veg._ p. 525.]\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\16: Clusius. _Exotic_. iv. c. 52, p. lxxix.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\16: \"Papas Peruanorum. Arachidna, Theoph. forte. Flores\r\nelegantes, uncialis amplitudinis aut majores, angulosi, singulari\r\nfolio constantes, sed ita complicato ut quinque folia discreta\r\nvideantur, coloris exterius ex purpura candicantis, interius\r\npurpurascentis, radiis quinque herbaceis ex umbilico stellæ instar\r\nprodeuntibus, et totidem staminibus flavis in umbonem coeuntibus.\"\r\n\r\nHe says that the Italians do not know whence they had the plant, and\r\nthat they call it _Taratouffli_. The name _Potato_ was, in England,\r\npreviously applied to the Sweet Potato (_Convolvulus batatas_),\r\nwhich was the _common_ Potato, in distinction to the _Virginian\r\n_Potato, at the time of Gerard's Herbal. (1597?) Gerard's figures of\r\nboth plants are copied from those of Clusius.\r\n\r\nIt may be seen by the description of Arachidna, already quoted from\r\nTheophrastus, (above,) that there is little plausibility in\r\nClusius's conjecture of the plant being known to the ancients. I\r\nneed not inform the botanist that this opinion is untenable.]\r\n\r\nThe addition of exotic species to the number of known plants was\r\nindeed going on rapidly during the interval which we are now\r\nconsidering. Francis Hernandez, a Spaniard, who visited America\r\ntowards the end of the sixteenth century, collected and described\r\nmany plants of that country, some of which were afterwards published\r\nby Recchi.[59\\16] Barnabas Cobo, who went as a missionary to America\r\nin 1596, also described plants.[60\\16] The Dutch, among other\r\nexertions which they made in their struggle with the tyranny of\r\nSpain, sent out an expedition which, for a time, conquered the\r\nBrazils; and among other fruits of this conquest, they published an\r\naccount of the natural history of the country.[61\\16] To avoid\r\ninterrupting the connexion of such labors, I will here carry them on\r\na little further in the order of time. Paul Herman, of Halle, in\r\nSaxony, went to the Cape of Good Hope and to Ceylon; and on his\r\nreturn, astonished the botanists of Europe by the vast quantity of\r\nremarkable plants which he introduced to their knowledge.[62\\16]\r\nRheede, the Dutch governor of Malabar, ordered descriptions and\r\ndrawings to be made of many curious species, which were published in\r\na large work in twelve folio volumes.[63\\16] Rumphe, another Dutch\r\nconsul at Amboyna,[64\\16] labored with zeal and success upon the\r\nplants of the Moluccas. Some species which occur in Madagascar\r\nfigured in a description of that island composed by the French\r\nCommandant Flacourt.[65\\16] Shortly afterwards, Engelbert\r\nKæmpfer,[66\\16] a Westphalian of great acquirements and undaunted\r\ncourage, visited Persia, Arabia Felix, the Mogul Empire, Ceylon,\r\nBengal, Sumatra, Java, Siam, Japan; Wheler travelled in Greece and\r\nAsia Minor; and Sherard, the English consul, published an account of\r\nthe plants of the neighborhood of Smyrna. {380}\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\16: _Nova Plantarum Regni Mexicana Historia_, Rom. 1651,\r\nfol.]\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\16: Sprengel, _Gesch. der Botanik_, ii. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\16: _Historia Naturalis Brasiliæ_, L. B. 1648, fol. (Piso\r\nand Maregraf).]\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\16: _Museum Zeylanicum_, L. B. 1726.]\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\16: _Hortus Malabaricus_, 1670-1703.]\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\16: _Herbarium Amboinense_, Amsterdam, 1741-51, fol.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\16: _Histoire de la grande Isle Madagascar_, Paris, 1661.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\16: _Amœnitates Exoticæ_, Lemgov. 1712. 4to.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the New World excited also the curiosity of\r\nbotanists. Hans Sloane collected the plants of Jamaica; John\r\nBanister those of Virginia; William Vernon, also an Englishman, and\r\nDavid Kriege, a Saxon, those of Maryland; two Frenchmen, Surian and\r\nFather Plumier, those of Saint Domingo.\r\n\r\nWe may add that public botanical gardens were about this time\r\nestablished all over Europe. We have already noticed the institution\r\nof that of Pisa in 1543; the second was that of Padua in 1545; the\r\nnext, that of Florence in 1556; the fourth, that of Bologna, 1568;\r\nthat of Rome, in the Vatican, dates also from 1568.\r\n\r\nThe first transalpine garden of this kind arose at Leyden in 1577;\r\nthat of Leipzig in 1580. Henry the Fourth of France established one\r\nat Montpellier in 1597. Several others were instituted in Germany;\r\nbut that of Paris did not begin to exist till 1626; that of Upsal,\r\nafterwards so celebrated, took its rise in 1657, that of Amsterdam\r\nin 1684. Morison, whom we shall soon have to mention, calls himself,\r\nin 1680, the first Director of the Botanical Garden at Oxford.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [To what is above said of Botanical Gardens and Botanical\r\nWriters, between the times of Cæsalpinus and Morison, I may add a\r\nfew circumstances. The first academical garden in France was that at\r\nMontpellier, which was established by Peter Richier de Belleval, at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century. About the same period, rare\r\nflowers were cultivated at Paris, and pictures of them made, in\r\norder to supply the embroiderers of the court-robes with new\r\npatterns. Thus figures of the most beautiful flowers in the garden\r\nof Peter Robins were published by the court-embroiderer Peter\r\nVallet, in 1608, under the title of _Le Jardin du Roi Henry IV_. But\r\nRobins' works were of great service to botany; and his garden\r\nassisted the studies of Renealmus (Paul Reneaulme), whose _Specimen\r\nHistoriæ Plantarum_ (Paris, 1611), is highly spoken of by the best\r\nbotanists. Recently, Mr. Robert Brown has named after him a new\r\ngenus of _Irideæ_ (RENEALMIA); adding, \"Dixi in memoriam PAULI\r\nRENEALMI, botanici sui ævi accuratissimi, atque staminum primi\r\nscrutatoris; qui non modo eorum numerum et situm, sed etiam\r\nfilamentorum proportionem passim descripsit, et characterem\r\ntetradynamicum siliquosarum perspexit.\" (_Prodromus Floræ Novæ\r\nHollandiæ_, p. 448.)\r\n\r\nThe oldest Botanical Garden in England is that at Hampton Court,\r\nfounded by Queen Elizabeth, and much enriched by Charles II. and\r\nWilliam III. (Sprengel, _Gesch. d. Bot._ vol. ii. p. 96.)]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, although there appeared no new system which {381}\r\ncommanded the attention of the botanical world, the feeling of the\r\nimportance of the affinities of plants became continually more\r\nstrong and distinct.\r\n\r\nLobel, who was botanist to James the First, and who published his\r\n_Stirpium Adversaria Nova_ in 1571, brings together the natural\r\nfamilies of plants more distinctly than his predecessors, and even\r\ndistinguishes (as Cuvier states,[67\\16]) monocotyledonous from\r\ndicotyledonous plants; one of the most comprehensive division-lines\r\nof botany, of which succeeding times discovered the value more\r\ncompletely. Fabius Columna,[68\\16] in 1616, gave figures of the\r\nfructification of plants on copper, as Gessner had before done on\r\nwood. But the elder Bauhin (John), notwithstanding all that\r\nCæsalpinus had done, retrograded, in a work published in 1619, into\r\nthe less precise and scientific distinctions of--trees with nuts;\r\nwith berries; with acorns; with pods; creeping plants, gourds, &c.:\r\nand no clear progress towards a system was anywhere visible among\r\nthe authors of this period.\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\16: Cuv. _Leçons, &c._ 198.]\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\16: Ib. 206.]\r\n\r\nWhile this continued to be the case, and while the materials, thus\r\ndestitute of order, went on accumulating, it was inevitable that the\r\nevils which Cæsalpinus had endeavored to remedy, should become more\r\nand more grievous. \"The nomenclature of the subject[69\\16] was in\r\nsuch disorder, it was so impossible to determine with certainty the\r\nplants spoken of by preceding writers, that thirty or forty\r\ndifferent botanists had given to the same plant almost as many\r\ndifferent names. Bauhin called by one appellation, a species which\r\nLobel or Matheoli designated by another. There was an actual chaos,\r\na universal confusion, in which it was impossible for men to find\r\ntheir way.\" We can the better understand such a state of things,\r\nfrom having, in our own time, seen another classificatory science,\r\nMineralogy, in the very condition thus described. For such a state\r\nof confusion there is no remedy but the establishment of a true\r\nsystem of classification; which by its real foundation renders a\r\nreason for the place of each species; and which, by the fixity of\r\nits classes, affords a basis for a standard nomenclature, as finally\r\ntook place in Botany. But before such a remedy is obtained, men\r\nnaturally try to alleviate the evil by tabulating the synonyms of\r\ndifferent writers, as far as they are able to do so. The task of\r\nconstructing such a _Synonymy_ of botany at the period of which we\r\nspeak, was undertaken by Gaspard Bauhin, the brother of John, but\r\nnineteen years younger. This work, the _Pinax Theatri Botanici_, was\r\nprinted {382} at Basil in 1623. It was a useful undertaking at the\r\ntime; but the want of any genuine order in the _Pinax_ itself,\r\nrendered it impossible that it should be of great permanent utility.\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\16: Ib. 212.]\r\n\r\nAfter this period, the progress of almost all the sciences became\r\nlanguid for a while; and one reason of this interruption was, the\r\nwars and troubles which prevailed over almost the whole of Europe.\r\nThe quarrels of Charles the First and his parliament, the civil wars\r\nand the usurpation, in England; in France, the war of the League,\r\nthe stormy reign of Henry the Fourth, the civil wars of the minority\r\nof Louis the Thirteenth, the war against the Protestants and the war\r\nof the Fronde in the minority of Louis the Fourteenth; the bloody\r\nand destructive Thirty Years' War in Germany; the war of Spain with\r\nthe United Provinces and with Portugal;--all these dire agitations\r\nleft men neither leisure nor disposition to direct their best\r\nthoughts to the promotion of science. The baser spirits were\r\nbrutalized; the better were occupied by high practical aims and\r\nstruggles of their moral nature. Amid such storms, the intellectual\r\npowers of man could not work with their due calmness, nor his\r\nintellectual objects shine with their proper lustre.\r\n\r\nAt length a period of greater tranquillity gleamed forth, and the\r\nsciences soon expanded in the sunshine. Botany was not inert amid\r\nthis activity, and rapidly advanced in a new direction, that of\r\nphysiology; but before we speak of this portion of our subject, we\r\nmust complete what we have to say of it as a classificatory science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Sequel to the Epoch of Cæsalpinus. Further Formation\r\nand Adoption of Systematic Arrangement._\r\n\r\nSOON after the period of which we now speak, that of the restoration\r\nof the Stuarts to the throne of England, systematic arrangements of\r\nplants appeared in great numbers; and in a manner such as to show\r\nthat the minds of botanists had gradually been ripening for this\r\nimprovement, through the influence of preceding writers, and the\r\ngrowing acquaintance with plants. The person whose name is usually\r\nplaced first on this list, Robert Morison, appears to me to be much\r\nless meritorious than many of those who published very shortly after\r\nhim; but I will give him the precedence in my narrative. He was a\r\nScotchman, who was wounded fighting on the royalist side in the\r\ncivil wars of England. On the triumph of the republicans, he\r\nwithdrew to France, when he became director of the garden of Gaston,\r\nDuke of Orléans at Blois; and there he came under the notice of our\r\nCharles {383} the Second; who, on his restoration, summoned Morison\r\nto England, where he became Superintendent of the Royal Gardens, and\r\nalso of the Botanic Garden at Oxford. In 1669, he published _Remarks\r\non the Mistakes of the two Bauhins_, in which he proves that many\r\nplants in the _Pinax_ are erroneously placed, and shows considerable\r\ntalent for appreciating natural families and genera. His great\r\nsystematic work appeared from the University press at Oxford in\r\n1680. It contains a system, but a system, Cuvier says,[70\\16] which\r\napproaches rather to a natural method than to a rigorous\r\ndistribution, like that of his predecessor Cæsalpinus, or that of\r\nhis successor Ray. Thus the herbaceous plants are divided into\r\n_climbers_, _leguminous_, _siliquose_, _unicapsalar_, _bicapsular_,\r\n_tricapsular_, _quadricapsular_, _quinquecapsular_; this division\r\nbeing combined with characters derived from the number of petals.\r\nBut along with these numerical elements, are introduced others of a\r\nloose and heterogeneous kind, for instance, the classification of\r\nherbs as _lactescent_ and _emollient_. It is not unreasonable to\r\nsay, that such a scheme shows no talent for constructing a complete\r\nsystem; and that the most distinct part of it, that dependent on the\r\nfruit, was probably borrowed from Cæsalpinus. That this is so, we\r\nhave, I think, strong proof; for though Morison nowhere, I believe,\r\nmentions Cæsalpinus, except in one place in a loose enumeration of\r\nbotanical writers,[71\\16] he must have made considerable use of his\r\nwork. For he has introduced into his own preface a passage copied\r\nliterally[72\\16] from the dedication of Cæsalpinus; which passage we\r\nhave already quoted (p. 374,) beginning, \"Since all science consists\r\nin the collection of similar, and the distinction of dissimilar\r\nthings.\" And that the mention of the original is not omitted by\r\naccident, appears from this; that Morison appropriates also the\r\nconclusion of the passage, which has a personal reference, \"_Conatus\r\nsum id præstare in universa plantarum historia, ut si quid pro\r\ningenii mei tenuitate in hujusmodi studio profecerim, ad communem\r\nutilitatem proferrem._\" That Morison, thus, at so long an interval\r\nafter the publication of the work of Cæsalpinus, borrowed from him\r\nwithout acknowledgement, and adopted his system so as to mutilate\r\nit, proves that he had neither the temper nor the talent of a\r\ndiscoverer; and justifies us withholding from him the credit which\r\nbelongs to those, who, in his time, resumed the great undertaking of\r\nconstructing a vegetable system.\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\16: Cuv. _Leçons_, &c. p. 486.]\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\16: Pref. p. i.]\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\16: Ib. p. ii.]\r\n\r\nAmong those whose efforts in this way had the greatest and earliest\r\n{384} influence, was undoubtedly our countryman, John Ray, who was\r\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, at the same time with Isaac\r\nNewton. But though Cuvier states[73\\16] that Ray was the model of\r\nthe systematists during the whole of the eighteenth century, the\r\nGermans claim a part of his merit for one of their countrymen,\r\nJoachim Jung, of Lubeck, professor at Hamburg.[74\\16] Concerning the\r\nprinciples of this botanist, little was known during his life. But a\r\nmanuscript of his book was communicated[75\\16] to Ray in 1660, and\r\nfrom this time forwards, says Sprengel, there might be noticed in\r\nthe writings of Englishmen, those better and clearer views to which\r\nJung's principles gave birth. Five years after the death of Jung,\r\nhis _Doxoscopia Physica_ was published, in 1662; and in 1678, his\r\n_Isagoge Phytoscopica_. But neither of these works was ever much\r\nread; and even Linnæus, whom few things escaped which concerned\r\nbotany, had, in 1771, seen none of Jung's works.\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\16: _Leçons Hist. Sc._ p. 487.]\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\16: Sprengel, ii. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\16: Ray acknowledges this in his _Index Plant. Agri\r\nCantab._ p. 87, and quotes from it the definition of _caulis_.]\r\n\r\nI here pass over Jung's improvements of botanical language, and\r\nspeak only of those which he is asserted to have suggested in the\r\narrangement of plants. He examines, says Sprengel,[76\\16] the value\r\nof characters of species, which, he holds, must not be taken from\r\nthe thorns, nor from color, taste, smell, medicinal effects, time\r\nand place of blossoming. He shows, in numerous examples, what plants\r\nmust be separated, though called by a common name, and what most be\r\nunited, though their names are several.\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\16: Sprengel, ii. 29.]\r\n\r\nI do not see in this much that interferes with the originality of\r\nRay's method,[77\\16] of which, in consequence of the importance\r\nascribed to it by Cuvier, as we have already seen, I shall give an\r\naccount, following that great naturalist.[78\\16] I confine myself to\r\nthe ordinary plants, and omit the more obscure vegetables, as\r\nmushrooms, mosses, ferns, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\16: _Methodus Plantarum Nova_, 1682. _Historia Plantarum_,\r\n1686.]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\16: Cuv.  _Leçons Hist. Sc._ 488.]\r\n\r\nSuch plants are _composite_ or _simple_. The _composite_ flowers are\r\nthose which contain many florets in the same _calyx_.[79\\16] These\r\nare subdivided according as they are composed altogether of complete\r\nflorets, {385} or of half florets, or of a centre of complete\r\nflorets, surrounded by a circumference or ray of demi-florets. Such\r\nare the divisions of the _corymbiferæ_, or _compositæ_.\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\16: _Involucrum_, in modern terminology.]\r\n\r\nIn the _simple_ flowers, the seeds are _naked_, or in a _pericarp_.\r\nThose with _naked_ seeds are arranged according to the number of the\r\nseeds, which may be one, two, three, four, or more. If there is only\r\none, no subdivision is requisite: if there are two, Ray makes a\r\nsubdivision, according as the flower has five petals, or a continuous\r\ncorolla. Here we come to several natural families. Thus, the flowers\r\nwith two seeds and five petals are the _Umbelliferous_ plants; the\r\nmonopetalous flowers with two seeds are the _Stellatæ_. He founds the\r\ndivision of four-seeded flowers on the circumstance of the leaves\r\nbeing opposite, or alternate; and thus again, we have the natural\r\nfamilies of _Asperifoliæ_, as _Echium_, &c., which have the leaves\r\nalternate, and the _Verticillatæ_, as _Salvia_, in which the leaves\r\nare opposite. When the flower has more than four seeds, he makes no\r\nsubdivision.\r\n\r\nSo much for simple flowers with naked seeds. In those where the\r\nseeds are surrounded by a _pericarp_, or fruit, this fruit is large,\r\nsoft, and fleshy, and the plants are _pomiferous_; or it is small\r\nand juicy, and the fruit is a berry, as a Gooseberry.\r\n\r\nIf the fruit is not juicy, but _dry_, it is multiple or simple. If\r\nit be simple, we have the _leguminose_ plants. If it be multiple,\r\nthe form of the flower is to be attended to. The flower may be\r\n_monopetalous_, or _tetrapetalous_, or _pentapetalous_, or with\r\nstill _more_ divisions. The monopetalous may be _regular_ or\r\n_irregular_; so may the tetrapetalous. The regular tetrapetalous\r\nflowers are, for example, the _Cruciferæ_, as Stock and Cauliflower;\r\nthe irregular, are the _papilionaceous_ plants, Peas, Beans, and\r\nVetches; and thus we again come to natural families. The remaining\r\nplants are divided in the same way, into those with _imperfect_, and\r\nthose with _perfect_, flowers. Those with _imperfect_ flowers are\r\nthe _Grasses_, the _Rushes_ (_Junci_), and the like; among those\r\nwith _perfect_ flowers, are the _Palmaceæ_, and the _Liliaceæ_.\r\n\r\nWe see that the division of plants is complete as a system; all\r\nflowers must belong to one or other of the divisions. Fully to\r\nexplain the characters and further subdivisions of these families,\r\nwould be to write a treatise on botany; but it is easily seen that\r\nthey exhaust the subject as far as they go.\r\n\r\nThus Ray constructed his system partly on the fruit and partly on\r\nthe flower; or more properly, according to the expression of\r\nLinnæus, {386} comparing his earlier with his later system, he began\r\nby being a _fructicist_, and ended by being a _corollist_.[80\\16]\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\16: Ray was a most industrious herbalizer, and I cannot\r\nunderstand on what ground Mirbel asserts (_Physiol. Veg._, tom. ii.\r\np. 531,) that he was better acquainted with books than with plants.]\r\n\r\nAs we have said, a number of systems of arrangement of plants were\r\npublished about this time, some founded on the fruit, some on the\r\ncorolla, some on the calyx, and these employed in various ways.\r\nRivinus[81\\16] (whose real name was Bachman,) classified by the\r\nflower alone; instead of combining it with the fruit, as Ray had\r\ndone.[82\\16] He had the further merit of being the first who\r\nrejected the old division, of _woody_ and _herbaceous_ plants; a\r\ndivision which, though at variance with any system founded upon the\r\nstructure of the plants was employed even by Tournefort, and only\r\nfinally expelled by Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\16: Cuv. _Leçons_, 491.]\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\16: _Historia Generalis ad rem Herbariam_, 1690.]\r\n\r\nIt would throw little light upon the history of botany, especially\r\nfor our purpose, to dwell on the peculiarities of these transitory\r\nsystems. Linnæus,[83\\16] after his manner, has given a\r\nclassification of them. Rivinus, as we have just seen, was a\r\n_corollist_, according to the regularity and number of the petals;\r\nHermann was a _fructicist_. Christopher Knaut[84\\16] adopted the\r\nsystem of Ray, but inverted the order of its parts; Christian Knaut\r\ndid nearly the same with regard to that of Rivinus, taking number\r\nbefore regularity in the flower.[85\\16]\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\16: _Philos. Bot._ p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\16: _Enumeratio Plantarum_, &c., 1687.]\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\16: Linn.]\r\n\r\nOf the systems which prevailed previous to that of Linnæus,\r\nTournefort's was by far the most generally accepted. Joseph Pitton\r\nde Tournefort was of a noble family in Provence, and was appointed\r\nprofessor at the Jardin du Roi in 1683. His well-known travels in\r\nthe Levant are interesting on other subjects, as well as botany. His\r\n_Institutio Rei Herbariæ_, published in 1700, contains his method,\r\nwhich is that of a _corollist_. He is guided by the regularity or\r\nirregularity of the flowers, by their form, and by the situation of\r\nthe receptacle of the seeds below the calyx, or within it. Thus his\r\nclasses are--those in which the flowers are _campaniform_, or\r\nbell-shaped; those in which they are _infundibuliform_, or\r\nfunnel-shaped, as Tobacco; then the irregular flowers, as the\r\n_Personatæ_, which resemble an ancient mask; the _Labiatæ_, with\r\ntheir two lips; the _Cruciform_; the _Rosaceæ_, with flowers like a\r\nrose; the _Umbelliferæ_; the _Caryophylleæ_, as the {387} Pink; the\r\n_Liliaceæ_, with six petals, as the Tulip, Narcissus, Hyacinth,\r\nLily; the _Papilionaceæ_, which are leguminous plants, the flower of\r\nwhich resembles a butterfly, as Peas and Beans; and finally, the\r\n_Anomalous_, as Violet, Nasturtium, and others.\r\n\r\nThough this system was found to be attractive, as depending, in an\r\nevident way, on the most conspicuous part of the plant, the flower,\r\nit is easy to see that it was much less definite than systems like\r\nthat of Rivinus, Hermann, and Ray, which were governed by number.\r\nBut Tournefort succeeded in giving to the characters of genera a\r\ndegree of rigor never before attained, and abstracted them in a\r\nseparate form. We have already seen that the reception of botanical\r\nSystems has depended much on their arrangement into Genera.\r\n\r\nTournefort's success was also much promoted by the author inserting\r\nin his work a figure of a flower and fruit belonging to each genus;\r\nand the figures, drawn by Aubriet, were of great merit. The study of\r\nbotany was thus rendered easy, for it could be learned by turning\r\nover the leaves of a book. In spite of various defects, these\r\nadvantages gave this writer an ascendancy which lasted, from 1700,\r\nwhen his book appeared, for more than half a century. For though\r\nLinnæus began to publish in 1735, his method and his nomenclature\r\nwere not generally adopted till 1760.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM OF LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Introduction of the Reform._\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH, perhaps, no man of science ever exercised a greater sway\r\nthan Linnæus, or had more enthusiastic admirers, the most\r\nintelligent botanists always speak of him, not as a great\r\ndiscoverer, but as a judicious and strenuous _Reformer_. Indeed, in\r\nhis own lists of botanical writers, he places himself among the\r\n\"Reformatores;\" and it is apparent that this is the nature of his\r\nreal claim to admiration; for the doctrine of the sexes of plants,\r\neven if he had been the first to establish it, was a point of\r\nbotanical physiology, a province of the {388} science which no one\r\nwould select as the peculiar field of Linnæus's glory; and the\r\nformation of a system of arrangement on the basis of this doctrine,\r\nthough attended with many advantages, was not an improvement of any\r\nhigher order than those introduced by Ray and Tournefort. But as a\r\nReformer of the state of Natural History in his time, Linnæus was\r\nadmirable for his skill, and unparalleled in his success. And we\r\nhave already seen, in the instance of the reform of mineralogy, as\r\nattempted by Mohs and Berzelius, that men of great talents and\r\nknowledge may fail in such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, only by means of the knowledge which he displays,\r\nand of the beauty and convenience of the improvements which he\r\nproposes, that any one can acquire such an influence as to procure\r\nhis suggestions to be adopted. And even if original circumstances of\r\nbirth or position could invest any one with peculiar prerogatives\r\nand powers in the republic of science, Karl Linné began his career\r\nwith no such advantages. His father was a poor curate in Smaland, a\r\nprovince of Sweden; his boyhood was spent in poverty and privation;\r\nit was with great difficulty that, at the age of twenty-one, he\r\ncontrived to subsist at the University of Upsal, whither a strong\r\npassion for natural history had urged him. Here, however, he was so\r\nfar fortunate, that Olaus Rudbeck, the professor of botany,\r\ncommitted to him the care of the Botanic Garden.[86\\16] The perusal\r\nof the works of Vaillant and Patrick Blair suggested to him the idea\r\nof an arrangement of plants, formed upon the sexual organs, the\r\nstamens and pistils; and of such an arrangement he published a\r\nsketch in 1731, at the age of twenty-four.\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\16: Sprengel, ii. 232.]\r\n\r\nBut we must go forwards a few years in his life, to come to the\r\nperiod to which his most important works belong. University and\r\nfamily quarrels induced him to travel; and, after various changes of\r\nscene, he was settled in Holland, as the curator of the splendid\r\nbotanical garden of George Clifford, an opulent banker. Here it\r\nwas[87\\16] that he laid the foundation of his future greatness. In\r\nthe two years of his residence at Harlecamp, he published nine\r\nworks. The first, the _Systema Naturæ_, which contained a\r\ncomprehensive sketch of the whole domain of Natural History, excited\r\ngeneral astonishment, by the acuteness of the observations, the\r\nhappy talent of combination, and the clearness of the systematic\r\nviews. Such a work could not fail to procure considerable respect\r\nfor its author. His _Hortus Cliffortiana_ {389} and _Musa\r\nCliffortiana_ added to this impression. The weight which he had thus\r\nacquired, he proceeded to use for the improvement of botany. His\r\n_Fundamenta Botanica_ and _Bibliotheca Botanica_ appeared in 1736;\r\nhis _Critica Botanica_ and _Genera Plantarum_ in 1737; his _Classes\r\nPlantarum_ in 1738; his _Species Plantarum_ was not published till\r\n1753; and all these works appeared in many successive editions,\r\nmaterially modified.\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\16: Ibid. 234.]\r\n\r\nThis circulation of his works showed that his labors were producing\r\ntheir effect. His reputation grew; and he was soon enabled to exert\r\na personal, as well as a literary, influence, on students of natural\r\nhistory. He became Botanist Royal, President of the Academy of\r\nSciences at Stockholm, and Professor in the University of Upsal; and\r\nthis office he held for thirty-six years with unrivalled credit;\r\nexercising, by means of his lectures, his constant publications, and\r\nhis conversation, an extraordinary power over a multitude of zealous\r\nnaturalists, belonging to every part of the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand more clearly the nature and effect of the\r\nreforms introduced by Linnæus into botany, I shall consider them\r\nunder the four following heads;--_Terminology_, _Nomenclature_,\r\n_Artificial System_, and _Natural System_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Linnæan Reform of Botanical Terminology._\r\n\r\nIT must be recollected that I designate as _Terminology_, the system\r\nof _terms_ employed in the _description_ of objects of natural\r\nhistory; while by _Nomenclature_, I mean the collection of the\r\n_names_ of _species_. The reform of the descriptive part of botany\r\nwas one of the tasks first attempted by Linnæus; and his terminology\r\nwas the instrument by which his other improvements were effected.\r\n\r\nThough most readers, probably, entertain, at first, a persuasion\r\nthat a writer ought to content himself with the use of common words\r\nin their common sense, and feel a repugnance to technical terms and\r\narbitrary rules of phraseology, as pedantic and troublesome; it is\r\nsoon found, by the student of any branch of science that, without\r\ntechnical terms and fixed rules, there can be no certain or\r\nprogressive knowledge. The loose and infantine grasp of common\r\nlanguage cannot hold objects steadily enough for scientific\r\nexamination, or lift them from one stage of generalization to\r\nanother. They must be secured by the rigid mechanism of a scientific\r\nphraseology. This necessity had been felt in all the sciences, from\r\nthe earliest periods of their progress. But the {390} conviction had\r\nnever been acted upon so as to produce a distinct and adequate\r\ndescriptive botanical language. Jung, indeed,[88\\16] had already\r\nattempted to give rules and precepts which should answer this\r\npurpose; but it was not till the _Fundamenta Botanica_ appeared,\r\nthat the science could be said to possess a fixed and complete\r\nterminology.\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\16: _Isagoge Phytoscopica_, 1679.]\r\n\r\nTo give an account of such a terminology, is, in fact, to give a\r\ndescription of a dictionary and grammar, and is therefore what\r\ncannot here be done in detail. Linnæus's work contains about a\r\nthousand terms of which the meaning and application are distinctly\r\nexplained; and rules are given, by which, in the use of such terms,\r\nthe botanist may avoid all obscurity, ambiguity, unnecessary\r\nprolixity and complexity, and even inelegance and barbarism. Of\r\ncourse the greater part of the words which Linnæus thus recognized\r\nhad previously existed in botanical writers; and many of them had\r\nbeen defined with technical precision. Thus Jung[89\\16] had already\r\nexplained what was a _composite_, what a _pinnate_ leaf; what kind\r\nof a bunch of flowers is a _spike_, a _panicle_, an _umbel_, a\r\n_corymb_, respectively. Linnæus extended such distinctions,\r\nretaining complete clearness in their separation. Thus, with him,\r\ncomposite leaves are further distinguished as _digitate_, _pinnate_,\r\n_bipinnate_, _pedate_, and so on; pinnate leaves are _abruptly_ so,\r\nor _with an odd_ one, or _with a tendril_; they are pinnate\r\n_oppositely_, _alternately_, _interruptedly_, _articulately_,\r\n_decursively_. Again, the _inflorescence_, as the mode of assemblage\r\nof the flowers is called, may be a _tuft_ (fasciculus), a _head_\r\n(capitulum), a _cluster_ (racemus), a _bunch_ (thyrsus), a\r\n_panicle_, a _spike_, a _catkin_ (amentum), a _corymb_, an _umbel_,\r\na _cyme_, a _whorl_ (verticillus). And the rules which he gives,\r\nthough often apparently arbitrary and needless, are found, in\r\npractice, to be of great service by their fixity and connexion. By\r\nthe good fortune of having had a teacher with so much delicacy of\r\ntaste as Linnæus, in a situation of so much influence, Botany\r\npossesses a descriptive language which will long stand as a model\r\nfor all other subjects.\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\16: Sprengel, ii. 28.]\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, appear to some persons, that such a terminology as\r\nwe have here described must be enormously cumbrous; and that, since\r\nthe terms are arbitrarily invested with their meaning, the invention\r\nof them requires no knowledge of nature. With respect to the former\r\ndoubt, we may observe, that technical description is, in reality,\r\nthe only description which is clearly intelligible; but that\r\ntechnical language cannot be understood without being learnt as any\r\nother {391} language is learnt; that is, the reader must connect the\r\nterms immediately with his own sensations and notions, and not\r\nmediately, through a verbal explanation; he must not have to guess\r\ntheir meaning, or to discover it by a separate act of interpretation\r\ninto more familiar language as often as they occur. The language of\r\nbotany must be the botanist's most familiar tongue. When the student\r\nhas thus learnt to _think_ in botanical language, it is no idle\r\ndistinction to tell him that a _bunch_ of grapes is not a _cluster_;\r\nthat is, a _thyrsus_ not a _raceme_. And the terminology of botany\r\nis then felt to be a useful implement, not an oppressive burden. It\r\nis only the schoolboy that complains of the irksomeness of his\r\ngrammar and vocabulary. The accomplished student possesses them\r\nwithout effort or inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAs to the other question, whether the construction of such a botanical\r\ngrammar and vocabulary implies an extensive and accurate acquaintance\r\nwith the facts of nature, no one can doubt who is familiar with any\r\ndescriptive science. It is true, that a person might construct an\r\narbitrary scheme of distinctions and appellations, with no attention\r\nto natural objects; and this is what shallow and self-confident\r\npersons often set about doing, in some branch of knowledge with which\r\nthey are imperfectly acquainted. But the slightest attempt to use such\r\na phraseology leads to confusion; and any continued use of it leads to\r\nits demolition. Like a garment which does not fit us, if we attempt to\r\nwork in it we tear it in pieces.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a good descriptive language is, in fact, an\r\ninductive process of the same kind as those which we have already\r\nnoticed in the progress of natural history. It requires the\r\n_discovery of fixed characters_, which discovery is to be marked and\r\nfixed, like other inductive steps, by appropriate _technical terms_.\r\nThe characters must be so far fixed, that the things which they\r\nconnect must have a more permanent and real association than the\r\nthings which they leave unconnected. If one bunch of grapes were\r\nreally a racemus, and another a thyrsus, according to the definition\r\nof these terms, this part of the Linnæan language would lose its\r\nvalue; because it would no longer enable us to assert a general\r\nproposition with respect to one kind of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Linnæan Reform of Botanical Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nIN the ancient writers each recognized kind of plants had a distinct\r\nname. The establishment of Genera led to the practice of designating\r\n{392} Species by the name of the genus, with the addition of a\r\n\"phrase\" to distinguish the species. These phrases, (expressed in\r\nLatin in the ablative case,) were such as not only to mark, but to\r\ndescribe the species, and were intended to contain such features of\r\nthe plant as were sufficient to distinguish it from others of the\r\nsame genus. But in this way the designation of a plant often became\r\na long and inconvenient assemblage of words. Thus different kinds of\r\nRose were described as,\r\n  Rosa campestris, spinis carens, biflora (_Rosa alpina_.)\r\n  Rosa aculeata, foliis odoratis subtus rubiginosis (_R. eglanteria_.)\r\n  Rosa carolina fragrans, foliis medio tenus serratis (_R. carolina_.)\r\n  Rosa sylvestris vulgaris, flore odorato incarnato (_R. canina_.)\r\nAnd several others. The prolixity of these appellations, their\r\nvariety in every different author, the insufficiency and confusion\r\nof the distinctions which they contained, were felt as extreme\r\ninconveniences. The attempt of Bauhin to remedy this evil by a\r\nSynonymy, had, as we have seen, failed at the time, for want of any\r\ndirecting principle; and was become still more defective by the\r\nlapse of years and the accumulation of fresh knowledge and new\r\nbooks. Haller had proposed to distinguish the species of each genus\r\nby the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on; but botanists found that their\r\nmemory could not deal with such arbitrary abstractions. The need of\r\nsome better nomenclature was severely felt.\r\n\r\nThe remedy which Linnæus finally introduced was the use of _trivial_\r\nnames; that is, the designation of each species by the name of the\r\ngenus along with a _single_ conventional word, imposed without any\r\ngeneral rule. Such names are added above in parentheses, to the\r\nspecimens of the names previously in use. But though this remedy was\r\nfound to be complete and satisfactory, and is now universally\r\nadopted in every branch of natural history, it was not one of the\r\nreforms which Linnæus at first proposed. Perhaps he did not at first\r\nsee its full value; or, if he did, we may suppose that it required\r\nmore self-confidence than he possessed, to set himself to introduce\r\nand establish ten thousand new names in the botanical world.\r\nAccordingly, the first attempts of Linnæus at the improvement of the\r\nnomenclature of botany were, the proposal of fixed and careful rules\r\nfor the generic name, and for the descriptive phrase. Thus, in his\r\n_Critica Botanica_, he gives many precepts concerning the selection\r\nof the names of {393} genera, intended to secure convenience or\r\nelegance. For instance, that they are to be single words;[90\\16] he\r\nsubstitutes _atropa_ for _bella donna_, and _leontodon_ for _dens\r\nleonis_; that they are not to depend upon the name of another\r\ngenus,[91\\16] as _acriviola_, _agrimonoides_; that they are\r\nnot[92\\16] to be \"sesquipedalia;\" and, says he, any word is\r\nsesquipedalian to me, which has more than twelve letters, as\r\n_kalophyllodendron_, for which he substitutes _calophyllon_. Though\r\nsome of these rules may seem pedantic, there is no doubt that, taken\r\naltogether, they tend exceedingly, like the labors of purists in\r\nother languages, to exclude extravagance, caprice, and barbarism in\r\nbotanical speech.\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\16: _Phil. Bot._ 224.]\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\16: Ib. 228, 229.]\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\16: Ib. 252.]\r\n\r\nThe precepts which he gives for the matter of the \"descriptive\r\nphrase,\" or, as it is termed in the language of the Aristotelian\r\nlogicians, the \"differentia,\" are, for the most part, results of the\r\ngeneral rule, that the most fixed characters which can be found are\r\nto be used; this rule being interpreted according to all the\r\nknowledge of plants which had then been acquired. The language of\r\nthe rules was, of course, to be regulated by the terminology, of\r\nwhich we have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThus, in the _Critica Botanica_, the name of a plant is considered\r\nas consisting of a generic word and a specific phrase; and these\r\nare, he says,[93\\16] the right and left hands of the plant. But he\r\nthen speaks of another kind of name; the _trivial_ name, which is\r\nopposed to the scientific. Such names were, he says,[94\\16] those of\r\nhis predecessors, and especially of the most ancient of them.\r\nHitherto[95\\16] no rules had been given for their use. He\r\nmanifestly, at this period, has small regard for them. \"Yet,\" he\r\nsays, \"trivial names may, perhaps, be used on this account,--that\r\nthe _differentia_ often turns out too long to be convenient in\r\ncommon use, and may require change as new species are discovered.\r\nHowever,\" he continues, \"in this work we set such names aside\r\naltogether, and attend only to the _differentiæ_.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\16: Ib. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\16: Ib. 261.]\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\16: Ib. 260.]\r\n\r\nEven in the _Species Plantarum_, the work which gave general\r\ncurrency to these trivial names, he does not seem to have yet dared\r\nto propose so great a novelty. They only stand in the margin of the\r\nwork. \"I have placed them there,\" he says in his Preface, \"that,\r\nwithout circumlocution, we may call every herb by a single name; I\r\nhave done this without selection, which would require more time. And\r\nI beseech all sane botanists to avoid most religiously ever {394}\r\nproposing a trivial name without a sufficient specific distinction,\r\nlest the science should fall into its former barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, that the general reception of these trivial\r\nnames of Linnæus, as the current language among botanists, was due, in\r\na very great degree, to the knowledge, care, and skill with which his\r\ncharacters, both of genera and of species, were constructed. The\r\nrigorous rules of selection and expression which are proposed in the\r\n_Fundamenta Botanica_ and _Critica Botanica_, he himself conformed to;\r\nand this scrupulosity was employed upon the results of immense labor.\r\n\"In order that I might make myself acquainted with the species of\r\nplants,\" he says, in the preface to his work upon them, \"I have\r\nexplored the Alps of Lapland, the whole of Sweden, a part of Norway,\r\nDenmark, Germany, Belgium, England, France: I have examined the\r\nBotanical Gardens of Paris, Oxford, Chelsea, Harlecamp, Leyden,\r\nUtrecht, Amsterdam, Upsal, and others: I have turned over the Herbals\r\nof Burser, Hermann, Clifford, Burmann, Oldenland, Gronovius, Royer,\r\nSloane, Sherard, Bobart, Miller, Tournefort, Vaillant, Jussieu,\r\n**Surian, Beck, Brown, &c.: my dear disciples have gone to distant\r\nlands, and sent me plants from thence; Kerlen to Canada, Hasselquist\r\nto Egypt, Asbech to China, Toren to Surat, Solander to England,\r\nAlstrœmer to Southern Europe, Martin to Spitzbergen, Pontin to\r\nMalabar, Kœhler to Italy, Forskähl to the East, Lœfling to Spain,\r\nMontin to Lapland: my botanical friends have sent me many seeds and\r\ndried plants from various countries: Lagerström many from the East\r\nIndies; Gronovius most of the Virginian; Gmelin all the Siberian;\r\nBurmann those of the Cape.\" And in consistency with this habit of\r\nimmense collection of materials, is his maxim,[96\\16] that \"a person\r\nis a better botanist in proportion as he knows more species.\" It will\r\neasily be seen that this maxim, like Newton's declaration that\r\ndiscovery requires patient thought alone, refers only to the exertions\r\nof which the man of genius is conscious; and leaves out of sight his\r\npeculiar endowments, which he does not see because they are part of\r\nhis power of vision. With the taste for symmetry which dictated the\r\n_Critica Botanica_, and the talent for classification which appears in\r\nthe _Genera Plantarum_, and the _Systema Naturæ_, a person must\r\nundoubtedly rise to higher steps of classificatory knowledge and\r\nskill, as he became acquainted with a greater number of facts.\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\16: _Phil. Bot._ 259.]\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged superiority of Linnæus in the knowledge of the\r\n{395} matter of his science, induced other persons to defer to him\r\nin what concerned its form; especially when his precepts were, for\r\nthe most part, recommended strongly both by convenience and\r\nelegance. The trivial names of the _Species Plantarum_ were\r\ngenerally received; and though some of the details may have been\r\naltered, the immense advantage of the scheme ensures its permanence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Linnæus's Artificial System._\r\n\r\nWE have already seen, that, from the time of Cæsalpinus, botanists\r\nhad been endeavoring to frame a systematic arrangement of plants.\r\nAll such arrangements were necessarily both artificial and natural:\r\nthey were _artificial_, inasmuch as they depended upon assumed\r\nprinciples, the number, form, and position of certain parts, by the\r\napplication of which the whole vegetable kingdom was imperatively\r\nsubdivided; they were _natural_, inasmuch as the justification of\r\nthis division was, that it brought together those plants which were\r\nnaturally related. No system of arrangement, for instance, would\r\nhave been tolerated which, in a great proportion of cases, separated\r\ninto distant parts of the plan the different species of the same\r\ngenus. As far as the main body of the genera, at least, all systems\r\nare natural.\r\n\r\nBut beginning from this line, we may construct our systems with two\r\nopposite purposes, according as we endeavor to carry our assumed\r\nprinciple of division rigorously and consistently through the\r\nsystem, or as we wish to associate natural families of a wider kind\r\nthan genera. The former propensity leads to an artificial, the\r\nlatter to a natural method. Each is a _System of Plants_; but in the\r\nfirst, the emphasis is thrown on the former word of the title, in\r\nthe other, on the latter.\r\n\r\nThe strongest recommendation of an artificial system, (besides its\r\napproaching to a natural method,) is, that it shall be capable of\r\neasy use; for which purpose, the facts on which it depends must be\r\napparent in their relations, and universal in their occurrence. The\r\nsystem of Linnæus, founded upon the number, position, and other\r\ncircumstances of the stamina and pistils, the reproductive organs of\r\nthe plants, possessed this merit in an eminent degree, as far as\r\nthese characters are concerned; that is, as far as the classes and\r\norders. In its further subdivision into genera, its superiority was\r\nmainly due to the exact observation and description, which we have\r\nalready had to notice as talents which Linnæus peculiarly possessed.\r\n\r\nThe Linnæan system of plants was more definite than that of {396}\r\nTournefort, which was governed by the corolla; for number is more\r\ndefinite than irregular form. It was more readily employed than any\r\nof those which depend on the fruit, for the flower is a more obvious\r\nobject, and more easily examined. Still, it can hardly be doubted,\r\nthat the circumstance which gave the main currency to the system of\r\nLinnæus was its physiological signification: it was the _Sexual\r\nSystem_. The relation of the parts to which it directed the\r\nattention, interested both the philosophical faculty and the\r\nimagination. And when, soon after the system had become familiar in\r\nour own country, the poet of _The Botanic Garden_ peopled the bell\r\nof every flower with \"Nymphs\" and \"Swains,\" his imagery was felt to\r\nbe by no means forced and far-fetched.\r\n\r\nThe history of the doctrine of the sexes of plants, as a point of\r\nphysiology, does not belong to this place; and the Linnæan system of\r\nclassification need not be longer dwelt upon for our present\r\npurpose. I will only explain a little further what has been said,\r\nthat it is, up to a certain point, a natural system. Several of\r\nLinnæus's classes are, in a great measure, natural associations,\r\nkept together in violation of his own artificial rules. Thus the\r\nclass _Diadelphia_, in which, by the system, the filaments of the\r\nstamina should be bound together in two parcels, does, in fact,\r\ncontain many genera which are_ monadelphous_, the filaments of the\r\nstamina all cohering so as to form one bundle only; as in _Genista_,\r\n_Spartium_, _Anthyllis_, _Lupinus_, &c. And why is this violation of\r\nrule? Precisely because these genera all belong to the natural tribe\r\nof Papilionaceous plants, which the author of the system could not\r\nprevail upon himself to tear asunder. Yet in other cases Linnæus was\r\ntrue to his system, to the injury of natural alliances, as he was,\r\nfor instance, in another portion of this very tribe of\r\n_Papilionaceæ_; for there are plants which undoubtedly belong to the\r\ntribe, but which have ten separate stamens; and these he placed in\r\nthe order _Decandria_. Upon the whole, however, he inclines rather\r\nto admit transgression of art than of nature.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this inclination was, that he rightly considered an\r\nartificial method as instrumental to the investigation of a natural\r\none; and to this part of his views we now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Linnæus's Views on a Natural Method._\r\n\r\nTHE admirers of Linnæus, the English especially, were for some time\r\nin the habit of putting his Sexual System in opposition to the\r\nNatural Method, which about the same time was attempted in France.\r\nAnd {397} as they often appear to have imagined that the ultimate\r\nobject of botanical methods was to know the name of plants, they\r\nnaturally preferred the Swedish method, which is excellent as a\r\n_finder_. No person, however, who wishes to know botany as a\r\nscience, that is, as a body of general truths, can be content with\r\nmaking names his ultimate object. Such a person will be constantly\r\nand irresistibly led on to attempt to catch sight of the natural\r\narrangement of plants, even before he discovers, as he will discover\r\nby pursuing such a course of study, that the knowledge of the\r\nnatural arrangement is the knowledge of the essential construction\r\nand vital mechanism of plants. He will consider an artificial method\r\nas a means of arriving at a natural method. Accordingly, however\r\nmuch some of his followers may have overlooked this, it is what\r\nLinnæus himself always held and taught. And though what he executed\r\nwith regard to this object was but little,[97\\16] the distinct\r\nmanner in which he presented the relations of an artificial and\r\nnatural method, may justly be looked upon as one of the great\r\nimprovements which he introduced into the study of his science.\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\16: The natural orders which he proposed are a bare\r\nenumeration of genera, and have not been generally followed.]\r\n\r\nThus in the _Classes Plantarum_ (1747), he speaks of the difficulty of\r\nthe task of discovering the natural orders, and of the attempts made\r\nby others. \"Yet,\" he adds, \"I too have labored at this, have done\r\nsomething, have much still to do, and shall labor at the object as\r\nlong as I live.\" He afterwards proposed sixty-seven orders, as the\r\nfragments of a natural method, always professing their\r\nimperfection.[98\\16] And in others of his works[99\\16] he lays down\r\nsome antitheses on the subject after his manner. \"The natural orders\r\nteach us the nature of plants; the artificial orders enable us to\r\nrecognize plants. The natural orders, without a key, do not constitute\r\na Method; the Method ought to be available without a master.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\16: _Phil. Bot._ p. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\16: _Genera Plantarum_, 1764. See _Prælect. in Ord. Nat._\r\np. xlviii.]\r\n\r\nThat extreme difficulty must attend the formation of a Natural Method,\r\nmay be seen from the very indefinite nature of the Aphorisms upon this\r\nsubject which Linnæus has delivered, and which the best botanists of\r\nsucceeding times have assented to. Such are these;--the Natural Orders\r\nmust be formed by attention, not to one or two, but to _all_ the parts\r\nof plants;--the same organs are of great importance in regulating the\r\ndivisions of one part of the system, and {398} of small importance in\r\nanother part;[100\\16]--the Character does not constitute the Genus,\r\nbut the Genus the Character;--the Character is necessary, not to make\r\nthe Genus, but to recognize it. The vagueness of these maxims is\r\neasily seen; the rule of attending to all the parts, implies, that we\r\nare to estimate their relative importance, either by physiological\r\nconsiderations (and these again lead to arbitrary rules, as, for\r\ninstance, the superiority of the function of nutrition to that of\r\nreproduction), or by a sort of latent naturalist instinct, which\r\nLinnæus in some passages seems to recognize. \"The Habit of a plant,\"\r\nhe says,[101\\16] \"must be secretly consulted. A practised botanist\r\nwill distinguish, at the first glance, the plants of different\r\nquarters of the globe, and yet will be at a loss to tell by what mark\r\nhe detects them. There is, I know not what look,--sinister, dry,\r\nobscure in African plants; superb and elevated, in the Asiatic; smooth\r\nand cheerful, in the American; stunted and indurated, in the Alpine.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\16: _Phil. Bot._ p. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\16: Ib. p. 171.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the rule that the same parts are of very different value in\r\ndifferent Orders, not only leaves us in want of rules or reasons\r\nwhich may enable us to compare the marks of different Orders, but\r\ndestroys the systematic completeness of the natural arrangement. If\r\nsome of the Orders be regulated by the flower and others by the\r\nfruit, we may have plants, of which the flower would place them in\r\none Order, and the fruit in another. The answer to this difficulty\r\nis the maxim already stated;--that no Character _makes_ the Order;\r\nand that if a Character do not enable us to recognize the Order, it\r\ndoes not answer its purpose, and ought to be changed for another.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, that the Character is to be employed as a servant and\r\nnot as a master, was a stumbling-block in the way of those disciples\r\nwho looked only for dogmatical and universal rules. One of Linnæus's\r\npupils, Paul Dietrich Giseke, has given us a very lively account of\r\nhis own perplexity on having this view propounded to him, and of the\r\nway in which he struggled with it. He had complained of the want of\r\nintelligible grounds, in the collection of natural orders given by\r\nLinnæus. Linnæus[102\\16] wrote in answer, \"You ask me for the\r\ncharacters of the Natural Orders: I confess I cannot give them.\"\r\nSuch a reply naturally increased Giseke's difficulties. But\r\nafterwards, in 1771, he had the good fortune to spend some time at\r\nUpsal; and he narrates a conversation which he held with the great\r\n{399} teacher on this subject, and which I think may serve to show\r\nthe nature of the difficulty;--one by no means easily removed, and\r\nby the general reader, not even readily comprehended with\r\ndistinctness. Giseke began by conceiving that an Order _must_ have\r\nthat attribute from which its name is derived;--that the _Umbellatæ_\r\nmust have their flower disposed in an umbel. The \"mighty master\"\r\nsmiled,[103\\16] and told him not to look at names, but at nature.\r\n\"But\" (said the pupil) \"what is the use of the name, if it does not\r\nmean what it professes to mean?\" \"It is of small import\" (replied\r\nLinnæus) \"_what_ you _call_ the Order, if you take a proper series\r\nof plants and give it some name, which is clearly understood to\r\napply to the plants which you have associated. In such cases as you\r\nrefer to, I followed the logical rule, of borrowing a name _a\r\npotiori_, from the principal member. Can you\" (he added) \"give me\r\nthe character of any single Order?\" _Giseke._ \"Surely, the character\r\nof the _Umbellatæ_ is, that they have an umbel?\" _Linnæus._ \"Good;\r\nbut there are plants which have an umbel, and are not of the\r\n_Umbellatæ_.\" _G._ \"I remember. We must therefore add, that they\r\nhave two naked seeds.\" _L._ \"Then, _Echinophora_, which has only one\r\nseed, and _Eryngium_, which has not an umbel, will not be\r\n_Umbellatæ_; and yet they are of the Order.\" _G._ \"I would place\r\n_Eryngium_ among the _Aggregatæ_. _L._ \"No; both are beyond dispute\r\n_Umbellatæ_. _Eryngium_ has an involucrum, five stamina, two\r\npistils, &c. Try again for your Character.\" _G._ \"I would transfer\r\nsuch plants to the end of the Order, and make them form the\r\ntransition to the next Order. _Eryngium_ would connect the\r\n_Umbellatæ_ with the _Aggregatæ_.\" _L._ \"Ah! my good friend, the\r\n_Transition_ from Order to Order is one thing; the _Character_ of an\r\nOrder is another. The Transitions I could indicate; but a Character\r\nof a Natural Order is impossible. I will not give my reasons for the\r\ndistribution of Natural Orders which I have published. You or some\r\nother person, after twenty or after fifty years, will discover them,\r\nand see I was in the right.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\16: _Linnæi Prælectiones_, Pref. p. xv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\16: \"Subrisit ὁ πανυ.\"]\r\n\r\nI have given a portion of this curious conversation in order to show\r\nthat the attempt to establish Natural Orders leads to convictions\r\nwhich are out of the domain of the systematic grounds on which they\r\nprofess to proceed. I believe the real state of the case to be that\r\nthe systematist, in such instances, is guided by an unformed and\r\nundeveloped apprehension of physiological functions. The ideas of\r\nthe form, {400} number, and figure of parts are, in some measure,\r\novershadowed and superseded by the rising perception of organic and\r\nvital relations; and the philosopher who aims at a Natural Method,\r\nwhile he is endeavoring merely to explore the apartment in which he\r\nhad placed himself, that of Arrangement, is led beyond it, to a\r\npoint where another light begins, though dimly, to be seen; he is\r\nbrought within the influence of the ideas of Organization and Life.\r\n\r\nThe sciences which depend on these ideas will be the subject of our\r\nconsideration hereafter. But what has been said may perhaps serve to\r\nexplain the acknowledged and inevitable imperfection of the\r\nunphysiological Linnæan attempts towards a natural method.\r\n\"Artificial Glasses are,\" Linnæus says, \"a substitute for Natural,\r\ntill Natural are detected.\" But we have not yet a Natural Method.\r\n\"Nor,\" he says, in the conversation above cited, \"can we have a\r\nNatural Method; for a Natural Method implies Natural Classes and\r\nOrders; and these Orders must have Characters.\" \"And they,\" he adds\r\nin another place,[104\\16] \"who, though they cannot obtain a complete\r\nNatural Method, arrange plants according to the fragments of such a\r\nmethod, to the rejection of the Artificial, seem to me like persons\r\nwho pull down a convenient vaulted room, and set about building\r\nanother, though they cannot turn the vault which is to cover it.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\16: _Gen. Plant. in Prælect._ p. xii.]\r\n\r\nHow far these considerations deterred other persons from turning\r\ntheir main attention to a natural method, we shall shortly see; but\r\nin the mean time, we must complete the history of the Linnæan Reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_Reception and Diffusion of the Linnæan Reform._\r\n\r\nWE have already seen that Linnæus received, from his own country,\r\nhonors and emoluments which mark his reputation as established, as\r\nearly as 1740; and by his publications, his lectures, and his\r\npersonal communications, he soon drew round him many disciples, whom\r\nhe impressed strongly with his own doctrines and methods. It would\r\nseem that the sciences of classification tend, at least in modern\r\ntimes more than other sciences, to collect about the chair of the\r\nteacher a large body of zealous and obedient pupils; Linnæus and\r\nWerner were by far the most powerful heads of schools of any men who\r\nappeared in the course of the last century. Perhaps one reason of\r\nthis is, that in these sciences, consisting of such an enormous\r\nmultitude of species, of descriptive {401} particulars, and of\r\nprevious classifications, the learner is dependent upon the teacher\r\nmore completely, and for a longer time than in other subjects of\r\nspeculation: he cannot so soon or so easily cast off the aid and\r\ninfluence of the master, to pursue reasonings and hypotheses of his\r\nown. Whatever the cause may be, the fact is, that the reputation and\r\nauthority of Linnæus, in the latter part of his life, were immense.\r\nHe enjoyed also royal favor, for the King and Queen of Sweden were\r\nboth fond of natural history. In 1753, Linnæus received from the\r\nhand of his sovereign the knighthood of the Polar Star, an honor\r\nwhich had never before been conferred for literary merit; and in\r\n1756, was raised to the rank of Swedish nobility by the title of Von\r\nLinné; and this distinction was confirmed by the Diet in 1762. He\r\nlived, honored and courted, to the age of seventy-one; and in 1778\r\nwas buried in the cathedral of Upsal, with many testimonials of\r\npublic respect and veneration.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle[105\\16] assigns, as the causes of the successes of the\r\nLinnæan system,--the specific names,--the characteristic\r\nphrase,--the fixation of descriptive language,--the distinction of\r\nvarieties and species,--the extension of the method to all the\r\nkingdoms of nature,--and the practice of introducing into it the\r\nspecies most recently discovered. This last course Linnæus\r\nconstantly pursued; thus making his works the most valuable for\r\nmatter, as they were the most convenient in form. The general\r\ndiffusion of his methods over Europe may be dated, perhaps, a few\r\nyears after 1760, when the tenth and the succeeding editions of the\r\n_Systema Naturæ_ were in circulation, professing to include every\r\nspecies of organized beings. But his pupils and correspondents\r\neffected no less than his books, in giving currency to his system.\r\nIn Germany,[106\\16] it was defended by Ludwig, Gesner, Fabricius.\r\nBut Haller, whose reputation in physiology was as great as that of\r\nLinnæus in methodology, rejected it as too merely artificial. In\r\nFrance, it did not make any rapid or extensive progress: the best\r\nFrench botanists were at this time occupied with the solution of the\r\ngreat problem of the construction of a Natural Method. And though\r\nthe rhetorician Rousseau charmed, we may suppose, with the elegant\r\nprecision of the _Philosophia Botanica_, declared it to be the most\r\nphilosophical work he had ever read in his life, Buffon and\r\nAndanson, describers and philosophers of a more ambitious school,\r\nfelt a repugnance to the rigorous rules, and limited, but finished,\r\nundertakings of the Swedish naturalist. To resist his {402} criticism\r\nand his influence, they armed themselves with dislike and contempt.\r\n\r\n[Note 105\\16: _Théor. Elém._ p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Note 106\\16: Sprengel, ii. 244.]\r\n\r\nIn England the Linnæan system was very favorably received:--perhaps\r\nthe more favorably, for being a strictly artificial system. For the\r\nindefinite and unfinished form which almost inevitably clings to a\r\nnatural method, appears to be peculiarly distasteful to our\r\ncountrymen. It might seem as if the suspense and craving which comes\r\nwith knowledge confessedly incomplete were so disagreeable to them,\r\nthat they were willing to avoid it, at any rate whatever; either by\r\nrejecting system altogether, or by accepting a dogmatical system\r\nwithout reserve. The former has been their course in recent times with\r\nregard to Mineralogy; the latter was their proceeding with respect to\r\nthe Linnæan Botany. It is in this country alone, I believe, that\r\n_Wernerian_ and _Linnæan_ Societies have been instituted. Such\r\nappellations somewhat remind us of the Aristotelian and Platonic\r\nschools of ancient Greece. In the same spirit it was, that the\r\nArtificial System was at one time here considered, not as subsidiary\r\nand preparatory to the Natural Orders, but as opposed to them. This\r\nwas much as if the disposition of an army in a review should be\r\nconsidered as inconsistent with another arrangement of it in a battle.\r\n\r\nWhen Linnæus visited England in 1736, Sloane, then the patron of\r\nnatural history in this country, is said to have given him a cool\r\nreception, such as was perhaps most natural from an old man to a\r\nyoung innovator; and Dillenius, the Professor at Oxford, did not\r\naccept the sexual system. But as Pulteney, the historian of English\r\nBotany, says, when his works became known, \"the simplicity of the\r\nclassical characters, the uniformity of the generic notes, all\r\nconfined to the parts of the fructification, and the precision which\r\nmarked the specific distinctions, merits so new, soon commanded the\r\nassent of the unprejudiced.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the progress of the introduction of the Linnæan System into\r\nEngland will be best understood from the statement of T. Martyn, who\r\nwas Professor of Botany in the University of Cambridge, from 1761 to\r\n1825. \"About the year 1750,\" he says,[107\\16] \"I was a pupil of the\r\nschool of our great countryman Ray; but the rich vein of knowledge,\r\nthe profoundness and precision, which I remarked everywhere in the\r\n_Philosophia Botanica_, (published in 1751,) withdrew me from my\r\nfirst master, and I became a decided convert to that system of\r\nbotany which has since been generally received. In 1753, the\r\n_Species_ {403} _Plantarum_, which first introduced the specific\r\nnames, made me a Linnæan completely.\" In 1763, he introduced the\r\nsystem in his lectures at Cambridge, and these were the first\r\nLinnæan lectures in England. Stillingfleet had already, in 1757, and\r\nLee, in 1760, called the attention of English readers to Linnæus.\r\nSir J. Hill, (the king's gardener at Kew,) in his _Flora\r\nBritannica_, published in 1760, had employed the classes and generic\r\ncharacters, but not the nomenclature; but the latter was adopted by\r\nHudson, in 1762, in the _Flora Anglica_.\r\n\r\n[Note 107\\16: Pref. to _Language of Botany_, 3rd edit. 1807.]\r\n\r\nTwo young Swedes, pupils of Linnæus, Dryander and Solander, settled in\r\nEngland, and were in intimate intercourse with the most active\r\nnaturalists, especially with Sir Joseph Banks, of whom the former was\r\nlibrarian, and the latter a fellow-traveller in Cook's celebrated\r\nvoyage. James Edward Smith was also one of the most zealous disciples\r\nof the Linnæan school; and, after the death of Linnæus, purchased his\r\nHerbariums and Collections. It is related,[108\\16] as a curious proof\r\nof the high estimation in which Linnæus was held, that when the\r\nSwedish government heard of this bargain, they tried, though too late,\r\nto prevent these monuments of their countryman's labor and glory being\r\ncarried from his native land, and even went so far as to send a\r\nfrigate in pursuit of the ship which conveyed them to England. Smith\r\nhad, however, the triumph of bringing them home in safety. On his\r\ndeath they were purchased by the Linnæan Society. Such relics serve,\r\nas will easily be imagined, not only to warm the reverence of his\r\nadmirers, but to illustrate his writings: and since they have been in\r\nthis country, they have been the object of the pilgrimage of many a\r\nbotanist, from every part of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Note 108\\16: Trapp's _Transl. of Stower's Life of Linnæus_, p. 314.]\r\n\r\nI have purposely confined myself to the history of the Linnæan system\r\nin the cases in which it is most easily applicable, omitting all\r\nconsideration of more obscure and disputed kinds of vegetables, as\r\nferns, mosses, fungi, lichens, sea-weeds, and the like. The nature and\r\nprogress of a classificatory science, which it is our main purpose to\r\nbring into view, will best be understood by attending, in the first\r\nplace, to the cases in which such a science has been pursued with the\r\nmost decided success; and the advances which have been made in the\r\nknowledge of the more obscure vegetables, are, in fact, advances in\r\nartificial classification, only in as far as they are advances in\r\nnatural classification, and in physiology.\r\n\r\nTo these subjects we now proceed. {404}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS TOWARDS A NATURAL SYSTEM OF BOTANY.\r\n\r\nWE have already said, that the formation of a Natural System of\r\nclassification must result from a comparison of _all_ the\r\nresemblances and differences of the things classed; but that, in\r\nacting upon this maxim, the naturalist is necessarily either guided\r\nby an obscure and instinctive feeling, which is, in fact, an\r\nundeveloped recognition of physiological relations, or else\r\nacknowledges physiology for his guide, though he is obliged to\r\nassume arbitrary rules in order to interpret its indications. Thus\r\nall Natural Classification of organized beings, either begins or\r\nsoon ends in Physiology; and can never advance far without the aid\r\nof that science. Still, the progress of the Natural Method in botany\r\nwent to such a length before it was grounded entirely on the anatomy\r\nof plants, that it will be proper, and I hope instructive, to\r\nattempt a sketch of it here.\r\n\r\nAs I have already had occasion to remark, the earlier systems of\r\nplants were natural; and they only ceased to be so, when it appeared\r\nthat the problem of constructing a _system_ admitted of a very\r\nuseful solution, while the problem of devising a _natural system_\r\nremained insoluble. But many botanists did not so easily renounce\r\nthe highest object of their science. In France, especially, a\r\nsuccession of extraordinary men labored at it with no inconsiderable\r\nsuccess: and they were seconded by worthy fellow-laborers in Germany\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe precept of taking into account all the parts of plants according\r\nto their importance, may be applied according to arbitrary rules. We\r\nmay, for instance, assume that the fruit is the most important part;\r\nor we may make a long list of parts, and look for agreement in the\r\ngreatest possible number of these, in order to construct our natural\r\norders. The former course was followed by Gærtner;[109\\16] the\r\nlatter by Adanson. Gærtner's principles, deduced from the dissection\r\nof more than a thousand kinds of fruits,[110\\16] exercised, in the\r\nsequel, a great and {405} permanent influence on the formation of\r\nnatural classes. Adanson's attempt, bold and ingenious, belonged,\r\nboth in time and character, to a somewhat earlier stage of the\r\nsubject.[111\\16] Enthusiastic and laborious beyond belief but\r\nself-confident, and contemptuous of the labors of others, Michael\r\nAdanson had collected, during five years spent in Senegal, an\r\nenormous mass of knowledge and materials; and had formed plans for\r\nthe systems which he conceived himself thus empowered to reach, far\r\nbeyond the strength and the lot of man.[112\\16] In his _Families of\r\nPlants_, however, all agree that his labors were of real value to\r\nthe science. The method which he followed is thus described by his\r\neloquent and philosophical eulogist.[113\\16]\r\n\r\n[Note 109\\16: _De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum_. Stuttg.\r\n1788-1791.]\r\n\r\n[Note 110\\16: Sprengel, ii. 290.]\r\n\r\n[Note 111\\16: _Familles des Plantes_, 1763.]\r\n\r\n[Note 112\\16: Cuvier's _Eloge_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 113\\16: Cuv. _Eloges_, tom. i. p. 282.]\r\n\r\nConsidering each organ by itself, he formed, by pursuing its various\r\nmodifications, a system of division, in which he arranged all known\r\nspecies according to that organ alone. Doing the same for another\r\norgan, and another, and so for many, he constructed a collection of\r\nsystems of arrangement, each artificial,--each founded upon one\r\nassumed organ. The species which come together in all these systems\r\nare, of all, naturally the nearest to each other; those which are\r\nseparated in a few of the systems, but contiguous in the greatest\r\nnumber, are naturally near to each other, though less near than the\r\nformer; those which are separated in a greater number, are further\r\nremoved from each other in nature; and they are the more removed,\r\nthe fewer are the systems in which they are associated.\r\n\r\nThus, by this method, we obtain the means of estimating precisely\r\nthe degree of natural affinity of all the species which our systems\r\ninclude, independent of a physiological knowledge of the influence\r\nof the organs. But the method has, Cuvier adds, the inconvenience of\r\npresupposing another kind of knowledge, which, though it belongs\r\nonly to descriptive natural history, is no less difficult to\r\nobtain;--the knowledge, namely, of all species, and of all the\r\norgans of each. A single one neglected, may lead to relations the\r\nmost false; and Adanson himself, in spite of the immense number of\r\nhis observations, exemplifies this in some instances.\r\n\r\nWe may add, that in the division of the structure into organs, and\r\nin the estimation of the gradations of these in each artificial\r\nsystem, there is still room for arbitrary assumption.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the two Jussieus had presented to the world a\r\n\"Natural Method,\" which produced a stronger impression than the\r\n{406} \"Universal Method\" of Adanson. The first author of the system\r\nwas Bernard de Jussieu, who applied it in the arrangement of the\r\ngarden of the Trianon, in 1759, though he never published upon it.\r\nHis nephew, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, in his _Treatise of the\r\nArrangement of the Trianon_,[114\\16] gave an account of the\r\nprinciples and orders of his uncle, which he adopted when he\r\nsucceeded him; and, at a later period, published his _Genera\r\nPlantarum secundum Ordines Naturales disposita_; a work, says\r\nCuvier, which perhaps forms as important an epoch in the sciences of\r\nobservation, as the _Chimie_ of Lavoisier does in the sciences of\r\nexperiment. The object of the Jussieus was to obtain a system which\r\nshould be governed by the natural affinities of the plants, while,\r\nat the same time, the characters by which the orders were ostensibly\r\ndetermined, should be as clear, simple, and precise, as those of the\r\nbest artificial system. The main points in these characters were the\r\nnumber of the cotyledons, and the structure of the seed: and\r\nsubordinate to this, the insertion of the stamina, which they\r\ndistinguished as _epigynous_, _perigynous_, and _hypogynous_,\r\naccording as they were inserted over, about, or under, the germen.\r\nAnd the classes which were formed by the Jussieus, though they have\r\nsince been modified by succeeding writers, have been so far retained\r\nby the most profound botanists, notwithstanding all the new care and\r\nnew light which have been bestowed upon the subject, as to show that\r\nwhat was done at first, was a real and important step in the\r\nsolution of the problem.\r\n\r\n[Note 114\\16: _Mém. Ac. P._ 1774.]\r\n\r\nThe merit of the formation of this natural method of plants must be\r\ndivided between the two Jussieus. It has been common to speak of the\r\nnephew, Antoine Laurent, as only the publisher of his uncle's\r\nwork.[115\\16] But this appears, from a recent statement,[116\\16] to\r\nbe highly unjust. Bernard left nothing in writing but the catalogues\r\nof the garden of the Trianon, which he had arranged according to his\r\nown views; but these catalogues consist merely of a series of names\r\nwithout explanation or reason added. The nephew, in 1773, undertook\r\nand executed for himself the examination of a natural family, the\r\n_Ranunculaceæ_; and he was wont to relate (as his son informs us)\r\nthat it {407} was this employment which first opened his eyes and\r\nrendered him a botanist. In the memoir which he wrote, he explained\r\nfully the relative importance of the characters of plants, and the\r\nsubordination of some to others;--an essential consideration, which\r\nAdanson's scheme had failed to take account of. The uncle died in\r\n1777; and his nephew, in speaking of him, compares his arrangement\r\nto the _Ordines Naturales_ of Linnæus: \"Both these authors,\" he\r\nsays, \"have satisfied themselves with giving a catalogue of genera\r\nwhich approach each other in different points, without explaining\r\nthe motives which induced them to place one order before another, or\r\nto arrange a genus under a certain order. These two arrangements may\r\nbe conceived as problems which their authors have left for botanists\r\nto solve. Linnæus published his; that of M. de Jussieu is only known\r\nby the manuscript catalogues of the garden of the Trianon.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 115\\16: _Prodromus Floræ Penins. Ind. Orient._ Wight and\r\nWalker-Arnott, Introd. p. xxxv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 116\\16: By Adrien de Jussieu, son of Antoine Laurent, in the\r\n_Annales des Sc. Nat._, Nov. 1834.]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the younger Jussieu had employed himself for\r\nnineteen years upon botany, that he published, in 1789, his _Genera\r\nPlantarum_; and by this time he had so entirely formed his scheme in\r\nhis head, that he began the impression without having written the\r\nbook, and the manuscript was never more than two pages in advance of\r\nthe printer's type.\r\n\r\nWhen this work appeared, it was not received with any enthusiasm;\r\nindeed, at that time, the revolution of states absorbed the thoughts\r\nof all Europe, and left men little leisure to attend to the\r\nrevolutions of science. The author himself was drawn into the vortex\r\nof public affairs, and for some years forgot his book. The method\r\nmade its way slowly and with difficulty: it was a long time before\r\nit was comprehended and adopted in France, although the botanists of\r\nthat country had, a little while before, been so eager in pursuit of\r\na natural system. In England and Germany, which had readily received\r\nthe Linnæan method, its progress was still more tardy.\r\n\r\nThere is only one point, on which it appears necessary further to\r\ndwell. A main and fundamental distinction in all natural systems, is\r\nthat of the Monocotyledonous and Dicotyledonous plants; that is,\r\nplants which unfold themselves from an embryo with two little\r\nleaves, or with one leaf only. This distinction produces its effects\r\nin the systems which are regulated by numbers; for the flowers and\r\nfruit of the monocotyledons are generally referrible to some law in\r\nwhich the number _three_ prevails; a type which rarely occurs in\r\ndicotyledons, these affecting most commonly an arrangement founded\r\non the number _five_. But it appears, when we attempt to rise\r\ntowards a natural {408} method, that this division according to the\r\ncotyledons is of a higher order than the other divisions according\r\nto number; and corresponds to a distinction in the general structure\r\nand organization of the plant. The apprehension of the due rank of\r\nthis distinction has gradually grown clearer. Cuvier[117\\16]\r\nconceives that he finds such a division clearly marked in Lobel, in\r\n1581, and employed by Ray as the basis of his classification a\r\ncentury later. This difference has had its due place assigned it in\r\nmore recent systems of arrangement; but it is only later still that\r\nits full import has been distinctly brought into view. Desfontaines\r\ndiscovered[118\\16] that the ligneous fibre is developed in an\r\nopposite manner in vegetables with one and with two\r\ncotyledons;--towards the inside in the former case, and towards the\r\noutside in the latter; and hence these two great classes have been\r\nsince termed _endogenous_ and _exogenous_.\r\n\r\n[Note 117\\16: _Hist. Sc. Nat._ ii. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Note 118\\16: _Hist. Sc. Nat._ i. pp. 196, 290.]\r\n\r\nThus this division, according to the cotyledons, appears to have the\r\nstamp of reality put upon it, by acquiring a physiological meaning.\r\nYet we are not allowed to forget, even at this elevated point of\r\ngeneralization, that _no one_ character can be imperative in a natural\r\nmethod. Lamarck, who employed his great talents on botany, before he\r\ndevoted himself exclusively to other branches of natural history,\r\npublished his views concerning methods, systems,[119\\16] and\r\ncharacters. His main principle is, that no single part of a plant,\r\nhowever essential, can be an absolute rule for classification; and\r\nhence he blames the Jussieuian method, as giving this inadmissible\r\nauthority to the cotyledons. Roscoe[120\\16] further urges that some\r\nplants, as _Orchis morio_, and _Limodorum verecundum_, have no visible\r\ncotyledons. Yet De Candolle, who labored along with Lamarck, in the\r\nnew edition of the _Flore Française_, has, as we have already\r\nintimated, been led, by the most careful application of the wisest\r\nprinciples, to a system of Natural Orders, of which Jussieu's may be\r\nlooked upon as the basis; and we shall find the greatest botanists, up\r\nto the most recent period, recognizing, and employing themselves in\r\nimproving, Jussieu's Natural Families; so that in the progress of this\r\npart of our knowledge, vague and perplexing as it is, we have no\r\nexception to our general aphorism, that no real acquisition in science\r\nis ever discarded. {409}\r\n\r\n[Note 119\\16: Sprengel, ii. 296; and, there quoted, _Flore\r\nFrançaise_, t. i. 3, 1778. _Mém. Ac. P._ 1785. _Journ. Hist. Nat._\r\nt. i. For Lamarck's _Méthode Analytique_, see Dumeril, _Sc. Nat._ i.\r\nArt. 390.]\r\n\r\n[Note 120\\16: Roscoe, _Linn. Tr._ vol. xi. _Cuscuta_ also has no\r\ncotyledons.]\r\n\r\nThe reception of the system of Jussieu in this country was not so\r\nready and cordial as that of Linnæus. As we have already noticed,\r\nthe two systems were looked upon as rivals. Thus Roscoe, in\r\n1810,[121\\16] endeavored to show that Jussieu's system was not more\r\nnatural than the Linnæan, and was inferior as an artificial system:\r\nbut he argues his points as if Jussieu's characters were the grounds\r\nof his distribution; which, as we have said, is to mistake the\r\nconstruction of a natural system. In 1803, Salisbury[122\\16] had\r\nalready assailed the machinery of the system, maintaining that there\r\nare no cases of perigynous stamens, as Jussieu assumes; but this he\r\nurges with great expressions of respect for the author of the\r\nmethod. And the more profound botanists of England soon showed that\r\nthey could appreciate and extend the natural method. Robert Brown,\r\nwho had accompanied Captain Flinders to New Holland in 1801, and\r\nwho, after examining that country, brought home, in 1805, nearly\r\nfour thousand species of plants, was the most distinguished example\r\nof this. In his preface to the _Prodromus Floræ Novæ Hollandiæ_, he\r\nsays, that he found himself under the necessity of employing the\r\nnatural method, as the only way of avoiding serious error, when he\r\nhad to deal with so many new genera as occur in New Holland; and\r\nthat he has, therefore, followed the method of Jussieu; the greater\r\npart of whose orders are truly natural, \"although their arrangement\r\nin classes, as is,\" he says, \"conceded by their author, no less\r\ncandid than learned, is often artificial, and, as appears to me,\r\nrests on doubtful grounds.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 121\\16: _Linn. Tr._ vol. xi. p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Note 122\\16: Ibid. vol. viii.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said, the reader will, I trust, see what\r\nan extensive and exact knowledge of the vegetable world, and what\r\ncomprehensive views of affinity, must be requisite in a person who\r\nhas to modify the natural system so as to make it suited to receive\r\nand arrange a great number of new plants, extremely different from\r\nthe genera on which the arrangement was first formed, as the New\r\nHolland genera for the most part were. He will also see how\r\nimpossible it must be to convey by extract or description any notion\r\nof the nature of these modifications: it is enough to say, that they\r\nhave excited the applause of botanists wherever the science is\r\nstudied, and that they have induced M. de Humboldt and his\r\nfellow-laborers, themselves botanists of the first rank, to dedicate\r\none of their works to him in terms of the strongest\r\nadmiration.[123\\16] Mr. Brown has also published {410} special\r\ndisquisitions on parts of the Natural System; as on Jussieu's\r\n_Proteaceæ_;[124\\16] on the _Asclepiadeæ_, a natural family of\r\nplants which must be separated from Jussieu's _Apocyneæ_;[125\\16]\r\nand other similar labors.\r\n\r\n[Note 123\\16: Roberto Brown, Britanniarum gloriæ atque ornamento,\r\ntotam Botanices scientiam ingenio mirifico complectenti. &c.]\r\n\r\n[Note 124\\16: _Linn. Tr._ vol. x. 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Note 125\\16: _Mem. of Wernerian N. H. Soc._ vol. i. 1809.]\r\n\r\nWe have, I think, been led, by our survey of the history of Botany,\r\nto this point;--that a Natural Method directs us to the study of\r\nPhysiology, as the only means by which we can reach the object. This\r\nconviction, which in botany comes at the end of a long series of\r\nattempts at classification, offers itself at once in the natural\r\nhistory of animals, where the physiological signification of the\r\nresemblances and differences is so much more obvious. I shall not,\r\ntherefore, consider any of these branches of natural history in\r\ndetail as examples of mere classification. They will come before us,\r\nif at all, more properly when we consider the classifications which\r\ndepend on the functions of organs, and on the corresponding\r\nmodifications which they necessarily undergo; that is, when we trace\r\nthe results of Physiology. But before we proceed to sketch the\r\nhistory of that part of our knowledge, there are a few points in the\r\nprogress of Zoology, understood as a mere classificatory science,\r\nwhich appear to me sufficiently instructive to make it worth our\r\nwhile to dwell upon them.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Mr. Lindley's recent work, _The Vegetable Kingdom_ (1846),\r\nmay be looked upon as containing the best view of the recent history\r\nof Systematic Botany. In the Introduction to this work, Mr. Lindley\r\nhas given an account of various recent works on the subject; as\r\nAgardh's _Classes Plantarum_ (1826); Perleb's _Lehrbuch der\r\nNaturgeschichte der Pflanzenreich_ (1826); Dumortier's _Florula\r\nBelgica_ (1827); Bartling's _Ordines Naturales Plantarum_ (1830);\r\nHess's _Uebersicht der Phanerogenischen Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien_\r\n(1832); Schulz's _Natürliches System des Pflanzenreich's_ (1832);\r\nHoraninow's _Primæ Lineæ Systematis Naturæ_ (1834); Fries's _Corpus\r\nFlorarum provincialium Sueciæ_ (1835); Martins's _Conspectus Regni\r\nVegetablis secundum Characteres Morphologicos_ (1835); Sir Edward F.\r\nBromhead's System, as published in the _Edinburgh Journal_ and other\r\nJournals (1836-1840); Endlicher's _Genera Plantarum secundum Ordines\r\nNaturales disposita_ (1836-1840); Perleb's _Clavis Classicum Ordinum\r\net Familiarum_ (1838); Adolphe Brongniart's _Enumération des Genres de\r\nPlantes_ (1843); Meisner's _Plantarum vascularium Genera secundum\r\nOrdines Naturales digesta_ (1843); Horaninow's _Tetractys Naturæ, seu\r\nSystema quinquemembre omnium Naturalium_ {411} (1843); Adrien de\r\nJussieu's _**Cours Elémentaire d'Histoire Naturelle. Botanique_\r\n(1844).\r\n\r\nMr. Lindley, in this as in all his works, urges strongly the\r\nsuperior value of natural as compared with artificial systems; his\r\nprinciples being, I think, nearly such as I have attempted to\r\nestablish in the _Philosophy of the Sciences_, Book viii., Chapter\r\nii. He states that the leading idea which has been kept in view in\r\nthe compilation of his work is this maxim of Fries: \"Singula sphæra\r\n(sectio) _ideam quandam_ exponit, indeque ejus character notione\r\nsimplici optime exprimitur;\" and he is hence led to think that the\r\ntrue characters of all natural assemblages are extremely simple.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading features in Mr. Lindley's system is that he has\r\nthrown the Natural Orders into groups subordinate to the higher\r\ndivisions of Classes and Sub-classes. He had already attempted this,\r\nin imitation of Agardh and Bartling, in his _Nixus Plantarum_\r\n(1838). The groups of Natural Orders were there called _Nixus_\r\n(tendencies); and they were denoted by names ending in _ales_; but\r\nthese groups were further subordinated to _Cohorts_. Thus the first\r\nmember of the arrangement was Class 1. EXOGENÆ. Sub-class 1.\r\nPOLYPETALÆ. Cohort 1. ALBUMINOSÆ. _Nixus_ 1. _Ranales_. Natural\r\nOrders included in this _Nixus_, Ranunculaceæ, Saraceniceæ,\r\nPapaveraceæ, &c. In the _Vegetable Kingdom_, the groups of Natural\r\nOrders are termed _Alliances_. In this work, the Sub-classes of the\r\nEXOGENS are four: I. DICLINOUS; II. HYPOGYNOUS; III. PERIGYNOUS; IV.\r\nEPIGYNOUS; and the Alliances are subordinated to these without the\r\nintervention of _Cohorts_.\r\n\r\nMr. Lindley has also, in this as in other works, given English names\r\nfor the Natural Orders. Thus for _Nymphaceæ_, _Ranunculaceæ_,\r\n_Tamaricaceæ_, _Zygophyllaceæ_, _Eleatrinaceæ_, he substitutes\r\nWater-Lilies, Crowfoots, Tamarisks, Bean-Capers, and Water-Peppers;\r\nfor _Malvaceæ_, _Aurantiaceæ_, _Gentianaceæ_, _Primulaceæ_,\r\n_Urtiaceæ_, _Euphorbiaceæ_, he employs Mallow-worts, Citron-worts,\r\nGentian-worts, Prim-worts, Nettle-worts, Spurge-worts; and the terms\r\nOrchids, Hippurids, Amaryllids, Irids, Typhads, Arads, Cucurbits,\r\nare taken as English equivalents for _Orchidaceæ_, _Haloragaceæ_,\r\n_Amaryllidaceæ_, _Iridaceæ_, _Typhaceæ_, _Araceæ_, _Cucurbitaceæ_.\r\nAll persons who wish success to the study of botany in England must\r\nrejoice to see it tend to assume this idiomatic shape.] {412}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE history of Systematic Botany, as we have presented it, may be\r\nconsidered as a sufficient type of the general order of progression\r\nin the sciences of classification. It has appeared, in the survey\r\nwhich we have had to give, that this science, no less than those\r\nwhich we first considered, has been formed by a series of inductive\r\nprocesses, and has, in its history, Epochs at which, by such\r\nprocesses, decided advances were made. The important step in such\r\ncases is, the seizing upon some artificial mark which conforms to\r\nnatural resemblances;--some basis of arrangement and nomenclature by\r\nmeans of which true propositions of considerable generality can be\r\nenunciated. The advance of other classificatory sciences, as well as\r\nbotany, must consist of such steps; and their course, like that of\r\nbotany, must (if we attend only to the real additions made to\r\nknowledge,) be gradual and progressive, from the earliest times to\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nTo exemplify this continued and constant progression in the whole\r\nrange of Zoology, would require vast knowledge and great labor; and\r\nis, perhaps, the less necessary, after we have dwelt so long on the\r\nhistory of Botany, considered in the same point of view. But there\r\nare a few observations respecting Zoology in general which we are\r\nled to make in consequence of statements recently promulgated; for\r\nthese statements seem to represent the history of Zoology as having\r\nfollowed a course very different from that which we have just\r\nascribed to the classificatory sciences in general. It is held by\r\nsome naturalists, that not only the formation of a systematic\r\nclassification in Zoology dates as far back as Aristotle; but that\r\nhis classification is, in many respects, superior to some of the\r\nmost admired and recent attempts of modern times.\r\n\r\nIf this were really the case, it would show that at least the idea\r\nof a Systematic Classification had been formed and developed long\r\nprevious to the period to which we have assigned such a step; and it\r\nwould be difficult to reconcile such an early maturity of Zoology\r\nwith the conviction, which we have had impressed upon us by the\r\nother {413} parts of our history, that not only labor but time, not\r\nonly one man of genius but several, and those succeeding each other,\r\nare requisite to the formation of any considerable science.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, the statements to which we refer, respecting the\r\nscientific character of Aristotle's Zoological system, are\r\naltogether without foundation; and this science confirms the lessons\r\ntaught us by all the others. The misstatements respecting\r\nAristotle's doctrines are on this account so important, and are so\r\ncurious in themselves, that I must dwell upon them a little.\r\n\r\nAristotle's nine Books _On Animals_ are a work enumerating the\r\ndifferences of animals in almost all conceivable respects;--in the\r\norgans of sense, of motion, of nutrition, the interior anatomy, the\r\nexterior covering, the manner of life, growth, generation, and many\r\nother circumstances. These differences are very philosophically\r\nestimated. \"The corresponding parts of animals,\" he says,[126\\16]\r\n\"besides the differences of quality and circumstance, differ in\r\nbeing more or fewer, greater or smaller, and, speaking generally, in\r\nexcess and defect. Thus some animals have crustaceous coverings,\r\nothers hard shells; some have long beaks, some short; some have many\r\nwings, some have few; Some again have parts which others want, as\r\ncrests and spurs.\" He then makes the following important remark:\r\n\"Some animals have parts which correspond to those of others, not as\r\nbeing the same in species, nor by excess and defect, but by\r\n_analogy_; thus a claw is analogous to a thorn, and a nail to a\r\nhoof, and a hand to the nipper of a lobster, and a feather to a\r\nscale; for what a feather is in a bird, that is a scale in a fish.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 126\\16: Lib. i. c. i.]\r\n\r\nIt will not, however, be necessary, in order to understand Aristotle\r\nfor our present purpose, that we should discuss his notion of\r\nAnalogy. He proceeds to state his object,[127\\16] which is, as we\r\nhave said, to describe the differences of animals in their structure\r\nand habits. He then observes, that for structure, we may take Man\r\nfor our type,[128\\16] as being best known to us; and the remainder\r\nof the first Book is occupied with a description of man's body,\r\nbeginning from the head, and proceeding to the extremities.\r\n\r\n[Note 127\\16: Lib. i. c. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 128\\16: c. iii.]\r\n\r\nIn the next Book, (from which are taken the principal passages in\r\nwhich his modern commentators detect his system,) he proceeds to\r\ncompare the differences of parts in different animals, according to\r\nthe order which he had observed in man. In the first chapter he\r\nspeaks {414} of the head and neck of animals; in the second, of the\r\nparts analogous to arms and hands; in the third, of the breast and\r\npaps, and so on; and thus he comes, in the seventh chapter, to the\r\nlegs, feet, and toes: and in the eleventh, to the teeth, and so to\r\nother parts.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a classification consists in the selection of\r\ncertain parts, as those which shall eminently and peculiarly\r\ndetermine the place of each species in our arrangement. It is clear,\r\ntherefore, that such an enumeration of differences as we have\r\ndescribed, supposing it complete, contains the materials of all\r\npossible classifications. But we can with no more propriety say that\r\nthe author of such an enumeration of differences is the author of\r\nany classification which can be made by means of them, than we can\r\nsay that a man who writes down the whole alphabet writes down the\r\nsolution of a given riddle or the answer to a particular question.\r\n\r\nYet it is on no other ground than this enumeration, so far as I can\r\ndiscover, that Aristotle's \"System\" has been so decidedly spoken\r\nof,[129\\16] and exhibited in the most formal tabular shape. The\r\nauthors of this _Systema Aristotelicum_, have selected, I presume,\r\nthe following passages from the work _On Animals_, as they might\r\nhave selected any other; and by arranging them according to a\r\nsubordination unknown to Aristotle himself have made for him a\r\nscheme which undoubtedly bears a great resemblance to the most\r\ncomplete systems of modern times.\r\n\r\n[Note 129\\16: _Linnæan Transactions_, vol. xvi. p. 24.]\r\n\r\nBook I., chap. v.--\"Some animals are viviparous, some oviparous,\r\nsome vermiparous. The viviparous are such as man, and the horse, and\r\nall those animals which have hair; and of aquatic animals, the whale\r\nkind, as the dolphin and cartilaginous fishes.\"\r\n\r\nBook II., chap. vii.--\"Of quadrupeds which have blood and are\r\nviviparous, some are (as to their extremities,) many-cloven, as the\r\nhands and feet of man. For some are many-toed, as the lion, the dog,\r\nthe panther; some are bifid, and have hoofs instead of nails, as the\r\nsheep, the goat, the elephant, the hippopotamus; and some have\r\nundivided feet, as the solid-hoofed animals, the horse and ass. The\r\nswine kind share both characters.\"\r\n\r\nChap. ii.--\"Animals have also great differences in the teeth, both\r\nwhen compared with each other and with man. For all quadrupeds which\r\nhave blood and are viviparous, have teeth. And in the first place,\r\nsome are ambidental,[130\\16] (having teeth in both jaws;) and some\r\n{415} are not so, wanting the front teeth in the upper jaw. Some\r\nhave neither front teeth nor horns, as the camel; some have\r\ntusks,[131\\16] as the boar, some have not. Some have\r\nserrated[132\\16] teeth, as the lion, the panther, the dog; some have\r\nthe teeth unvaried,[133\\16] as the horse and the ox; for the animals\r\nwhich vary their cutting-teeth have all serrated teeth. No animal\r\nhas both tusks and horns; nor has any animal with serrated teeth\r\neither of those weapons. The greater part have the front teeth\r\ncutting, and those within broad.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 130\\16: Ἀμφόδοντα.]\r\n\r\n[Note 131\\16: Χαυλιόδοντα.]\r\n\r\n[Note 132\\16: Καρχαρόδοντα.]\r\n\r\n[Note 133\\16: Ἀνεπάλλακτα.]\r\n\r\nThese passages undoubtedly contain most of the differences on which\r\nthe asserted Aristotelian classification rests; but the\r\nclassification is formed by using the characters drawn from the\r\nteeth, in order to subdivide those taken from the feet; whereas in\r\nAristotle these two sets of characters stand side by side, along\r\nwith dozens of others; any selection of which, employed according to\r\nany arbitrary method of subordination, might with equal justice be\r\ncalled Aristotle's system.\r\n\r\nWhy, for instance, in order to form subdivisions of animals, should\r\nwe not go on with Aristotle's continuation of the second of the\r\nabove quoted passages, instead of capriciously leaping to the third?\r\n\"Of these some have horns, some have none . . . Some have a\r\nfetlock-joint,[134\\16] some have none . . . Of those which have\r\nhorns, some have them solid throughout, as the stag; others, for the\r\nmost part, hollow . . . Some cast their horns, some do not.\" If it\r\nbe replied, that we could not, by means of such characters, form a\r\ntenable zoological system; we again ask by what right we assume\r\nAristotle to have made or attempted a systematic arrangement, when\r\nwhat he has written, taken in its natural order, does not admit of\r\nbeing construed into a system.\r\n\r\n[Note 134\\16: Ἀστράγαλον.]\r\n\r\nAgain, what is the object of any classification? This, at least,\r\namong others. To enable the person who uses it to study and describe\r\nmore conveniently the objects thus classified. If, therefore,\r\nAristotle had formed or adopted any system of arrangement, we should\r\nsee it in the order of the subjects in his work. Accordingly, so far\r\nas he has a system, he professes to make this use of it. At the\r\nbeginning of the fifth Book, where he is proceeding to treat of the\r\ndifferent modes of generation of animals, he says, \"As we formerly\r\nmade a Division of animals according to their kinds, we must now, in\r\nthe same manner, give a general survey of their History (θεωρίαν).\r\nExcept, indeed, that in the former case we made our commencement by\r\na description {416} of man, but in the present instance we must\r\nspeak of him last, because he requires most study. We must begin\r\nthen with those animals which have shells; we must go on to those\r\nwhich have softer coverings, as crustacea, soft animals, and\r\ninsects; after these, fishes, both viviparous and oviparous; then\r\nbirds; then land animals, both viviparous and oviparous.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this passage that Aristotle had certain wide and\r\nindefinite views of classification, which though not very exact, are\r\nstill highly creditable to him; but it is equally clear that he was\r\nquite unconscious of the classification that has been ascribed to\r\nhim. If he had adopted that or any other system, this was precisely\r\nthe place in which he must have referred to and employed it.\r\n\r\nThe honor due to the stupendous accumulation of zoological knowledge\r\nwhich Aristotle's works contain, cannot be tarnished by our denying\r\nhim the credit of a system which he never dreamt of and which, from\r\nthe nature of the progress of science, could not possibly be\r\nconstructed at that period. But, in reality, we may exchange the\r\nmistaken claims which we have been contesting for a better, because\r\na truer praise. Aristotle does show, as far as could be done at his\r\ntime, a perception of the need of groups, and of names of groups, in\r\nthe study of the animal kingdom; and thus may justly be held up as\r\nthe great figure in the Prelude to the Formation of Systems which\r\ntook place in more advanced scientific times.\r\n\r\nThis appears, in some measure, from the passage last quoted. For not\r\nonly is there, in that, a clear recognition of the value and object\r\nof a method in natural history; but the general arrangement of the\r\nanimal kingdom there proposed has considerable scientific merit, and\r\nis, for the time, very philosophical. But there are passages in his\r\nwork in which he shows a wish to carry the principle of arrangement\r\nmore into detail. Thus, in the first Book, before proceeding to his\r\nsurvey of the differences of animals,[135\\16] after speaking of such\r\nclasses as Quadrupeds. Birds, Fishes, Cetaceous, Testaceous,\r\nCrustaceous Animals, Mollusks, Insects, he says, (chap. vii.)\r\n\"Animals cannot be divided into large genera, in which one kind\r\nincludes many kinds. For some kinds are unique, and have no\r\ndifference of species, as _man_. Some have such kinds, but have no\r\nnames for them. Thus all quadrupeds which have not wings, have\r\nblood. But of these, some are viviparous, some oviparous. Those\r\nwhich are {417} viviparous have not all hair; those which are\r\noviparous have scales.\" We have here a manifestly intentional\r\nsubordination of characters: and a kind of regret that we have not\r\nnames for the classes here indicated; such, for instance, as\r\nviviparous quadrupeds having hair. But he follows the subject into\r\nfurther detail. \"Of the class of viviparous quadrupeds,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"there are many genera,[136\\16] but these again are\r\nwithout names, except specific names, such as _man_, _lion_, _stag_,\r\n_horse_, _dog_, and the like. Yet there is a genus of animals that\r\nhave names, as the horse, the ass, the _oreus_, the _ginnus_, the\r\n_innus_, and the animal which in Syria is called _heminus_ (mule);\r\nfor these are called _mules_, from their resemblance only; not being\r\nmules, for they breed of their own kind. Wherefore,\" he adds, that\r\nis, because we do not possess recognized genera and generic names of\r\nthis kind, \"we must take the species separately, and study the\r\nnature of each.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 135\\16: Γένη.]\r\n\r\n[Note 136\\16: **Εἴδη.]\r\n\r\nThese passages afford us sufficient ground for placing Aristotle at\r\nthe head of those naturalists to whom the first views of the\r\nnecessity of a zoological system are due. It was, however, very long\r\nbefore any worthy successor appeared, for no additional step was\r\nmade till modern times. When Natural History again came to be\r\nstudied in Nature, the business of Classification, as we have seen,\r\nforced itself upon men's attention, and was pursued with interest in\r\nanimals, as in plants. The steps of its advance were similar in the\r\ntwo cases;--by successive naturalists, various systems of artificial\r\nmarks were selected with a view to precision and convenience;--and\r\nthese artificial systems assumed the existence of certain natural\r\ngroups, and of a natural system to which they gradually tended. But\r\nthere was this difference between botany and zoology:--the reference\r\nto physiological principles, which, as we have remarked, influenced\r\nthe natural systems of vegetables in a latent and obscure manner,\r\nbotanists being guided by its light, but hardly aware that they were\r\nso, affected the study of systematic zoology more directly and\r\nevidently. For men can neither overlook the general physiological\r\nfeatures of animals, nor avoid being swayed by them in their\r\njudgments of the affinities of different species. Thus the\r\nclassifications of zoology tended more and more to a union with\r\ncomparative anatomy, as the science was more and more\r\nimproved.[137\\16] But comparative anatomy belongs to the subject of\r\nthe next Book; and anything it may be proper to say respecting its\r\ninfluence upon zoological arrangements, will properly find a place\r\nthere. {418}\r\n\r\n[Note 137\\16: Cuvier, _Leç. d'Anat. Comp._ vol. i. p. 17.]\r\n\r\nIt will appear, and indeed it hardly requires to be proved, that\r\nthose steps in systematic zoology which are due to the light thrown\r\nupon the subject by physiology, are the result of a long series of\r\nlabors by various naturalists, and have been, like other advances in\r\nscience, led to and produced by the general progress of such\r\nknowledge. We can hardly expect that the classificatory sciences can\r\nundergo any material improvement which is not of this kind. Very\r\nrecently, however, some authors have attempted to introduce into\r\nthese sciences certain principles which do not, at first sight,\r\nappear as a continuation and extension of the previous researches of\r\ncomparative anatomists. I speak, in particular, of the doctrines of\r\na _Circular Progression_ in the series of affinity; of a _Quinary\r\nDivision_ of such circular groups; and of a relation of _Analogy_\r\nbetween the members of such groups, entirely distinct from the\r\nrelation of _Affinity_.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of Circular Progression has been propounded principally\r\nby Mr. Macleay; although, as he has shown,[138\\16] there are\r\nsuggestions of the same kind to be found in other writers. So far as\r\nthis view negatives the doctrine of a mere linear progression in\r\nnature, which would place each genus in contact only with the\r\npreceding and succeeding ones, and so far as it requires us to\r\nattend to more varied and ramified resemblances, there can be no\r\ndoubt that it is supported by the result of all the attempts to form\r\nnatural systems. But whether that assemblage of circles of\r\narrangement which is now offered to naturalists, be the true and\r\nonly way of exhibiting the natural relations of organized bodies, is\r\na much more difficult question, and one which I shall not here\r\nattempt to examine; although it will be found, I think, that those\r\nanalogies of science which we have had to study, would not fail to\r\nthrow some light upon such an inquiry. The prevalence of an\r\ninvariable numerical law in the divisions of natural groups, (as the\r\nnumber _five_ is asserted to prevail by Mr. Macleay, the number\r\n_ten_ by Fries, and other numbers by other writers), would be a\r\ncurious fact, if established; but it is easy to see that nothing\r\nshort of the most consummate knowledge of natural history, joined\r\nwith extreme clearness of view and calmness of judgment, could\r\nenable any one to pronounce on the attempts which have been made to\r\nestablish such a principle. But the doctrine of a relation of\r\n_Analogy_ distinct from Affinity, in the manner which has recently\r\nbeen taught, seems to be obviously at variance with that gradual\r\napproximation of the classificatory to the {419} physiological\r\nsciences, which has appeared to us to be the general tendency of\r\nreal knowledge. It seems difficult to understand how a reference to\r\nsuch relations as those which are offered as examples of\r\nanalogy[139\\16] can be otherwise than a retrograde step in science.\r\n\r\n[Note 138\\16: _Linn. Trans._ vol. xvi. p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Note 139\\16: For example, the goatsucker has an _affinity_ with the\r\nswallow; but it has an _analogy_ with the bat, because both fly at\r\nthe same hour of the day, and feed in the same manner.--Swainson,\r\n_Geography and Classification of Animals_, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nWithout, however, now dwelling upon these points, I will treat a\r\nlittle more in detail of one of the branches of Zoology.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [For the more recent progress of Systematic Zoology, see\r\nin the _Reports_ of the British Association, in 1834, Mr. L.\r\nJenyns's _Report an the Recent Progress and Present State of\r\nZoology_, and in 1844, Mr. Strickland's _Report on the Recent\r\nProgress and Present State of Ornithology_. In these Reports, the\r\nquestions of the Circular Arrangement, the Quinary System, and the\r\nrelation of Analogy and Affinity are discussed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF ICHTHYOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF it had been already observed and admitted that sciences of the\r\nsame kind follow, and must follow, the same course in the order of\r\ntheir development, it would be unnecessary to give a history of any\r\nspecial branch of Systematic Zoology; since botany has already\r\nafforded us a sufficient example of the progress of the\r\nclassificatory sciences. But we may be excused for introducing a\r\nsketch of the advance of one department of zoology, since we are led\r\nto the attempt by the peculiar advantage we possess in having a\r\ncomplete history of the subject written with great care, and brought\r\nup to the present time, by a naturalist of unequalled talents and\r\nknowledge. I speak of Cuvier's _Historical View of Ichthyology_,\r\nwhich forms the first chapter of his great work on that part of\r\nnatural history. The place and office in the progress of this\r\nscience, which is assigned to each person by Cuvier, will probably\r\nnot be lightly contested. It will, therefore, be no small\r\nconfirmation of the justice of the views on which the {420}\r\ndistribution of the events in the history of botany was founded, if\r\nCuvier's representation of the history of ichthyology offers to us\r\nobviously a distribution almost identical.\r\n\r\nWe shall find that this is so;--that we have, in zoology as in botany,\r\na period of unsystematic knowledge; a period of misapplied erudition;\r\nan epoch of the discovery of fixed characters; a period in which many\r\nsystems were put forward; a struggle of an artificial and a natural\r\nmethod; and a gradual tendency of the natural method to a manifestly\r\nphysiological character. A few references to Cuvier's history will\r\nenable us to illustrate these and other analogies.\r\n\r\n_Period of Unsystematic Knowledge._--It would be easy to collect a\r\nnumber of the fabulous stories of early times, which formed a\r\nportion of the imaginary knowledge of men concerning animals as well\r\nas plants. But passing over these, we come to a long period and a\r\ngreat collection of writers, who, in various ways, and with various\r\ndegrees of merit, contributed to augment the knowledge which existed\r\nconcerning fish, while as yet there was hardly ever any attempt at a\r\nclassification of that province of the animal kingdom. Among these\r\nwriters, Aristotle is by far the most important. Indeed he carried\r\non his zoological researches under advantages which rarely fall to\r\nthe lot of the naturalist; if it be true, as Athenæus and Pliny\r\nstate,[140\\16] that Alexander gave him sums which amounted to nine\r\nhundred talents, to enable him to collect materials for his history\r\nof animals, and put at his disposal several thousands of men to be\r\nemployed in hunting, fishing, and procuring information for him. The\r\nworks of his on Natural History which remain to us are, nine Books\r\n_Of the History of Animals_; four, _On the Parts of Animals_; five,\r\n_On the Generation of Animals_; one, _On the Going of Animals_; one,\r\n_Of the Sensations, and the Organs of them_; one, _On Sleeping and\r\nWaking_; one, _On the Motion of Animals_; one, _On the Length and\r\nShortness of Life_; one, _On Youth and Old Age_; one, _On Life and\r\nDeath_; one, _On Respiration_. The knowledge of the external and\r\ninternal conformation of animals, their habits, instincts, and uses,\r\nwhich Aristotle displays in these works, is spoken of as something\r\nwonderful even to the naturalists of our own time. And he may be\r\ntaken as a sufficient representative of the whole of the period of\r\nwhich we speak; for he is, says Cuvier,[141\\16] not only the first,\r\nbut the only one of the ancients who has treated of the natural\r\nhistory of fishes (the province to which {421} we now confine\r\nourselves,) in a scientific point of view, and in a way which shows\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n[Note 140\\16: Cuv. _Hist. Nat. des Poissons_, i. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Note 141\\16: Cuv. p. 18.]\r\n\r\nWe may pass over, therefore, the other ancient authors from whose\r\nwritings Cuvier, with great learning and sagacity, has levied\r\ncontributions to the history of ichthyology; as Theophrastus, Ovid,\r\nPliny, Oppian, Athenæus, Ælian, Ausonius, Galen. We may, too, leave\r\nunnoticed the compilers of the middle ages, who did little but\r\nabstract and disfigure the portions of natural history which they\r\nfound in the ancients. Ichthyological, like other knowledge, was\r\nscarcely sought except in books, and on that very account was not\r\nunderstood when it was found.\r\n\r\n_Period of Erudition._--Better times at length came, and men began to\r\nobserve nature for themselves. The three great authors who are held to\r\nbe the founders of modern ichthyology, appeared in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century; these were Bélon, Rondelet, and Salviani, who all\r\npublished about 1555. All the three, very different from the compilers\r\nwho filled the interval from Aristotle to them, themselves saw and\r\nexamined the fishes which they describe, and have given faithful\r\nrepresentations of them. But, resembling in that respect the founders\r\nof modern botany, Briassavola, Ruellius, Tragus, and others, they\r\nresembled them in this also, that they attempted to make their own\r\nobservations a commentary upon the ancient writers. Faithful to the\r\nspirit of their time, they are far more careful to make out the names\r\nwhich each fish bore in the ancient world, and to bring together\r\nscraps of their history from the authors in whom these names occur,\r\nthan to describe them in a lucid manner; so that without their\r\nfigures, says Cuvier, it would be almost as difficult to discover\r\ntheir species as those of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of describing and naming species so that they can be\r\nrecognized, is little appreciated at first, although it is in\r\nreality the main-spring of the progress of the sciences of\r\nclassification. Aristotle never dreamt that the nomenclature which\r\nwas in use in his time could ever become obscure;[142\\16] hence he\r\nhas taken no precaution to enable his readers to recognize the\r\nspecies of which he speaks; and in him and in other ancient authors,\r\nit requires much labor and great felicity of divination to determine\r\nwhat the names mean. The perception of this difficulty among modern\r\nnaturalists led to systems, and to nomenclature founded upon system;\r\nbut these did not come into {422} being immediately at the time of\r\nwhich we speak; nor till the evil had grown to a more inconvenient\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n[Note 142\\16: Cuvier, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n_Period of Accumulation of Materials. Exotic Collections._--The\r\nfishes of Europe were for some time the principal objects of study;\r\nbut those of distant regions soon came into notice.[143\\16] In the\r\nseventeenth century the Dutch conquered Brazil, and George Margrave,\r\nemployed by them, described the natural productions of the country,\r\nand especially the fishes. Bontius, in like manner, described some\r\nof those of Batavia. Thus these writers correspond to Romphius and\r\nRheede in the history of botany. Many others might be mentioned; but\r\nwe must hasten to the formation of systems, which is our main object\r\nof attention.\r\n\r\n[Note 143\\16: Cuv. p. 43.]\r\n\r\n_Epoch of the Fixation of Characters. Ray and Willoughby._--In\r\nbotany, as we have seen, though Ray was one of the first who\r\ninvented a connected system, he was preceded at a considerable\r\ninterval by Cæsalpinus, who had given a genuine solution of the same\r\nproblem. It is not difficult to assign reasons why a sound\r\nclassification should be discovered for plants at an earlier period\r\nthan for fishes. The vastly greater number of the known species, and\r\nthe facilities which belong to the study of vegetables, give the\r\nbotanist a great advantage; and there are numerical relations of a\r\nmost definite kind (for instance, the number of parts of the\r\nseed-vessel employed by Cæsalpinus as one of the bases of his\r\nsystem), which are tolerably obvious in plants, but which are not\r\neasily discovered in animals. And thus we find that in ichthyology,\r\nRay, with his pupil and friend Willoughby, appears as the first\r\nfounder of a tenable system.[144\\16]\r\n\r\n[Note 144\\16: Francisci Willoughbeii, Armigeri, _de Historia\r\nPiscium_, libri iv. jussu et sumptibus Societatis Regiæ Londinensis\r\nediti, &c. Totum opus recognovit, coaptavit, supplevit, librum etiam\r\nprimum et secundum adjecit Joh. Raius. Oxford, 1668.]\r\n\r\nThe first great division in this system is into _cartilaginous_ and\r\n_bony_ fishes; a primary division, which had been recognized by\r\nAristotle, and is retained by Cuvier in his latest labors. The\r\nsubdivisions are determined by the general form of the fish (as long\r\nor flat), by the teeth, the presence or absence of ventral fins, the\r\nnumber of dorsal fins, and the nature of the spines of the fins, as\r\nsoft or prickly. Most of these characters have preserved their\r\nimportance in later systems; especially the last, which, under the\r\nterms _malacopterygian_ and _acanthopterygian_, holds a place in the\r\nbest recent arrangements. {423}\r\n\r\nThat this system was a true first approximation to a solution of the\r\nproblem, appears to be allowed by naturalists. Although, says\r\nCuvier,[145\\16] there are in it no genera well defined and well\r\nlimited, still in many places the species are brought together very\r\nnaturally, and in such a way that a few words of explanation would\r\nsuffice to form, from the groups thus presented to us, several of\r\nthe genera which have since been received. Even in botany, as we\r\nhave seen, genera were hardly maintained with any degree of\r\nprecision, till the binary nomenclature of Linnæus made this\r\ndivision a matter of such immense convenience.\r\n\r\n[Note 145\\16: Cuvier, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of this convenience, the value of a brief and sure\r\nnomenclature, had not yet been duly estimated. The work of Willoughby\r\nforms an epoch,[146\\16] and a happy epoch, in the history of\r\nichthyology; for the science, once systematized, could distinguish the\r\nnew from the old, arrange methodically, describe clearly. Yet, because\r\nWilloughby had no nomenclature of his own, and no fixed names for his\r\ngenera, his immediate influence was not great. I will not attempt to\r\ntrace this influence in succeeding authors, but proceed to the next\r\nimportant step in the progress of system.\r\n\r\n[Note 146\\16: p. 58.]\r\n\r\n_Improvement of the System. Artedi._--Peter Artedi was a countryman\r\nand intimate friend of Linnæus; and rendered to ichthyology nearly\r\nthe same services which Linnæus rendered to botany. In his\r\n_Philosophia Ichthyologica_, he analysed[147\\16] all the interior\r\nand exterior parts of animals; he created a precise terminology for\r\nthe different forms of which these parts are susceptible; he laid\r\ndown rules for the nomenclature of genera and species; besides his\r\nimprovements of the subdivisions of the class. It is impossible not\r\nto be struck with the close resemblance between these steps, and\r\nthose which are due to the _Fundamenta Botanica_. The latter work\r\nappeared in 1736, the former was published by Linnæus, after the\r\ndeath of the author, in 1738; but Linnæus had already, as early as\r\n1735, made use of Artedi's manuscripts in the ichthyological part of\r\nhis _Systema Naturæ_. We cannot doubt that the two young naturalists\r\n(they were nearly of the same age), must have had a great influence\r\nupon each other's views and labors; and it would be difficult now to\r\nascertain what portion of the peculiar merits of the Linnæan reform\r\nwas derived from Artedi. But we may remark that, in ichthyology at\r\nleast, Artedi appears to have been a naturalist of more original\r\nviews and profounder philosophy than his friend and editor, who\r\nafterwards himself took up the subject. {424} The reforms of\r\nLinnæus, in all parts of natural history, appear as if they were\r\nmainly dictated by a love of elegance, symmetry, clearness, and\r\ndefiniteness; but the improvement of the ichthyological system by\r\nArtedi seems to have been a step in the progress to a natural\r\narrangement. His genera,[148\\16] which are forty-five in number, are\r\nso well constituted, that they have almost all been preserved; and\r\nthe subdivisions which the constantly-increasing number of species\r\nhas compelled his successors to introduce, have very rarely been\r\nsuch that they have led to the transposition of his genera.\r\n\r\n[Note 147\\16: p. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Note 148\\16: Cuvier, p. 71.]\r\n\r\nIn its bases, however, Artedi's was an artificial system. His\r\ncharacters were positive and decisive, founded in general upon the\r\nnumber of rays of the membrane of the gills, of which he was the\r\nfirst to mark the importance;--upon the relative position of the\r\nfins, upon their number, upon the part of the mouth where the teeth\r\nare found, upon the conformation of the scales. Yet, in some cases,\r\nhe has recourse to the interior anatomy.\r\n\r\nLinnæus himself at first did not venture to deviate from the\r\nfootsteps of a friend, who, in this science, had been his master.\r\nBut in 1758, in the tenth edition of the _Systema Naturæ_, he chose\r\nto depend upon himself and devised a new ichthyological method. He\r\ndivided some genera, united others, gave to the species trivial\r\nnames and characteristic phrases, and added many species to those of\r\nArtedi. Yet his innovations are for the most part disapproved of by\r\nCuvier; as his transferring the _chondropterygian_ fishes of Artedi\r\nto the class of reptiles, under the title of _Amphybia nantes_; and\r\nhis rejecting the distinction of acanthopterygian and\r\nmalacopterygian, which, as we have seen, had prevailed from the time\r\nof Willoughby, and introducing in its stead a distribution founded\r\non the presence or absence of the ventral fins, and on their\r\nsituation with regard to the pectoral fins. \"Nothing,\" says Cuvier,\r\n\"more breaks the true connexions of genera than these orders of\r\n_apodes_, _jugulares_, _thoracici_, and _abdominales_.\"\r\n\r\nThus Linnæus, though acknowledging the value and importance of\r\nnatural orders, was not happy in his attempts to construct a system\r\nwhich should lead to them. In his detection of good characters for\r\nan artificial system he was more fortunate. He was always attentive\r\nto number, as a character; and he had the very great merit[149\\16]\r\nof introducing into the classification the number of rays of the\r\nfins of each species. This mark is one of great importance and use.\r\nAnd this, as well as {425} other branches of natural history,\r\nderived incalculable advantages from the more general merits of the\r\nillustrious Swede;[150\\16]--the precision of the characters, the\r\nconvenience of a well-settled terminology, the facility afforded by\r\nthe binary nomenclature. These recommendations gave him a\r\npre-eminence which was acknowledged by almost all the naturalists of\r\nhis time, and displayed by the almost universal adoption of his\r\nnomenclature, in zoology, as well as in botany; and by the almost\r\nexclusive employment of his distributions of classes, however\r\nimperfect and artificial they might be.\r\n\r\n[Note 149\\16: p. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Note 150\\16: Cuvier, p. 85.]\r\n\r\nAnd even[151\\16] if Linnæus had had no other merit than the impulse\r\nhe gave to the pursuit of natural science, this alone would suffice\r\nto immortalize his name. In rendering natural history easy, or at\r\nleast in making it appear so, he diffused a general taste for it.\r\nThe great took it up with interest; the young, full of ardor, rushed\r\nforwards in all directions, with the sole intention of completing\r\nhis system. The civilized world was eager to build the edifice which\r\nLinnæus had planned.\r\n\r\n[Note 151\\16: Ib. p. 88.]\r\n\r\nThis spirit, among other results, produced voyages of natural\r\nhistorical research, sent forth by nations and sovereigns. George\r\nthe Third of England had the honor of setting the example in this\r\nnoble career, by sending out the expeditions of Byron, Wallis, and\r\nCarteret, in 1765. These were followed by those of Bougainville,\r\nCook, Forster, and others. Russia also scattered several scientific\r\nexpeditions through her vast dominions; and pupils of Linnæus sought\r\nthe icy shores of Greenland and Iceland, in order to apply his\r\nnomenclature to the productions of those climes. But we need not\r\nattempt to convey any idea of the vast stores of natural historical\r\ntreasures which were thus collected from every part of the globe.\r\n\r\nI shall not endeavor to follow Cuvier in giving an account of the\r\ngreat works of natural history to which this accumulation of materials\r\ngave rise; such as the magnificent work of Bloch on Fishes, which\r\nappeared in 1782-1785; nor need I attempt, by his assistance, to\r\ncharacterize or place in their due position the several systems of\r\nclassification proposed about this time. But in the course of these\r\nvarious essays, the distinction of the artificial and natural methods\r\nof classification came more clearly into view than before; and this is\r\na point so important to the philosophy of the subject, that we must\r\ndevote a few words to it. {426}\r\n\r\n_Separation of the Artificial and Natural Methods in Ichthyology._--It\r\nhas already been said that all so-called _artificial methods_ of\r\nclassification must be natural, at least as to the narrowest members\r\nof the system; thus the artificial Linnæan method is natural as to\r\nspecies, and even as to genera. And on the other hand, all proposed\r\nnatural methods, so long as they remain unmodified, are artificial as\r\nto their characteristic marks. Thus a Natural Method is an attempt to\r\nprovide positive and distinct _characters_ for the _wider_ as well as\r\nfor the narrower _natural groups_. These considerations are applicable\r\nto zoology as well as to botany. But the question, how we know natural\r\ngroups before we find marks for them, was, in botany, as we have seen,\r\nsusceptible only of vague and obscure answers:--the mind forms them,\r\nit was said, by taking the aggregate of all the characters; or by\r\nestablishing a subordination of characters. And each of these answers\r\nhad its difficulty, of which the solution appeared to be, that in\r\nattempting to form natural orders we are really guided by a latent\r\nundeveloped estimate of physiological relations. Now this principle,\r\nwhich was so dimly seen in the study of vegetables, shines out with\r\nmuch greater clearness when we come to the study of animals, in which\r\nthe physiological relations of the parts are so manifest that they\r\ncannot be overlooked, and have so strong an attraction for our\r\ncuriosity that we cannot help having our judgments influenced by them.\r\nHence the superiority of natural systems in zoology would probably be\r\nfar more generally allowed than in botany; and no arrangement of\r\nanimals which, in a large number of instances, violated strong and\r\nclear natural affinities, would be tolerated because it answered the\r\npurpose of enabling us easily to find the name and place of the animal\r\nin the artificial system. Every system of zoological arrangement may\r\nbe supposed to aspire to be a natural system. But according to the\r\nvarious habits of the minds of systematizers, this object was pursued\r\nmore or less steadily and successfully; and these differences came\r\nmore and more into view with the increase of knowledge and the\r\nmultiplication of attempts.\r\n\r\nBloch, whose ichthyological labors have been mentioned, followed in\r\nhis great work the method of Linnæus. But towards the end of his\r\nlife he had prepared a general system, founded upon one single\r\nnumerical principle;--the number of fins; just as the sexual system\r\nof Linnæus is founded upon the number of stamina; and he made his\r\nsubdivisions according to the position of the ventral and pectoral\r\nfins; the same character which Linnæus had employed for his primary\r\n{427} division. He could not have done better, says Cuvier,[152\\16]\r\nif his object had been to turn into ridicule all artificial methods,\r\nand to show to what absurd combinations they may lead.\r\n\r\n[Note 152\\16: p. 108.]\r\n\r\nCuvier himself who always pursued natural systems with a singularly\r\nwise and sagacious consistency, attempted to improve the\r\nichthyological arrangements which had been proposed before him. In\r\nhis _Règne Animal_, published in 1817, he attempts the problem of\r\narranging this class; and the views suggested to him, both by his\r\nsuccesses and his failures, are so instructive and philosophical,\r\nthat I cannot illustrate the subject better than by citing some of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"The class of fishes,\" he says,[153\\16] \"is, of all, that which\r\noffers the greatest difficulties, when we wish to subdivide it into\r\norders, according to fixed and obvious characters. After many\r\ntrials, I have determined on the following distribution, which in\r\nsome instances is wanting in precision, but which possesses the\r\nadvantage of keeping the natural families entire.\r\n\r\n[Note 153\\16: _Règne Animal_, vol. ii. p. 110.]\r\n\r\n\"Fish form two distinct series;--that of _chondropterygians_ or\r\n_cartilaginous fish_, and that of _fish_ properly so called.\r\n\r\n\"The _first_ of these series has for its character, that the\r\npalatine bones replace, in it, the bones of the upper jaw: moreover\r\nthe whole of its structure has evident analogies, which we shall\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\"It divides itself into three ORDERS:\r\n\"The CYCLOSTOMES, in which the jaws are soldered (_soudées_) into an\r\nimmovable ring, and the bronchiæ are open in numerous holes.\r\n\r\n\"The SELACIANS, which have the bronchiæ like the preceding, but not\r\nthe jaws.\r\n\r\n\"The STURONIANS, in which the bronchiæ are open as usual by a slit\r\nfurnished with an operculum.\r\n\r\n\"The second series, or that of _ordinary fishes_, offers me, in the\r\nfirst place, a primary division, into those of which the maxillary\r\nbone and the palatine arch are dovetailed (_engrenés_) to the skull.\r\nOf these I make an order of PECTOGNATHS, divided into two families;\r\nthe _gymnodonts_ and the _scleroderms_.\r\n\r\n\"After these I have the fishes with complete jaws, but with bronchiæ\r\nwhich, instead of having the form of combs, as in all the others,\r\nhave the form of a series of little tufts (_houppes_). Of these I\r\nagain form an order, which I call LOPHOBRANCHS, which only includes\r\none family. {428}\r\n\r\n\"There then remains an innumerable quantity of fishes, to which we\r\ncan no longer apply any characters except those of the exterior\r\norgans of motion. After long examination, I have found that the\r\nleast bad of these characters is, after all, that employed by Ray\r\nand Artedi, taken from the nature of the first rays of the dorsal\r\nand of the anal fin. Thus ordinary fishes are divided into\r\nMALACOPTERYGIANS, of which all the rays are soft, except sometimes\r\nthe first of the dorsal fin or the pectorals;--and\r\nACANTHOPTERYGIANS, which have always the first portion of the\r\ndorsal, or of the first dorsal when there are two, supported by\r\nspinous rays, and in which the anal has also some such rays, and the\r\nventrals, at least, each one.\r\n\r\n\"The former may be subdivided without inconvenience, according to\r\ntheir ventral fins, which are sometimes situate behind the abdomen,\r\nsometimes adherent to the apparatus of the shoulder, or, finally,\r\nare sometimes wanting altogether.\r\n\r\n\"We thus arrive at the three orders of ABDOMINAL MALACOPTERYGIANS,\r\nof SUBBRACHIANS, and of APODES; each of which includes some natural\r\nfamilies which we shall explain: the first, especially, is very\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\n\"But this basis of division is absolutely impracticable with the\r\nAcanthopterygians; and the problem of establishing among these any\r\nother subdivision than that of the natural families has hitherto\r\nremained for me insoluble. Fortunately several of these families\r\noffer characters almost as precise as those which we could give to\r\ntrue orders.\r\n\r\n\"In truth, we cannot assign to the families of fishes, ranks as\r\nmarked, as for example, to those of mammifers. Thus the\r\nChondropterygians on the one hand hold to reptiles by the organs of\r\nthe senses, and by those of generation in some; and they are related\r\nto mollusks and worms by the imperfection of the skeleton in others.\r\n\r\n\"As to Ordinary Fishes, if any part of the organization is found\r\nmore developed in some than in others, there does not result from\r\nthis any pre-eminence sufficiently marked, or of sufficient\r\ninfluence upon their whole system, to oblige us to consult it in the\r\nmethodical arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"We shall place them, therefore, nearly in the order in which we\r\nhave just explained their characters.\"\r\n\r\nI have extracted the whole of this passage, because, though it is\r\ntoo technical to be understood in detail by the general reader,\r\nthose who have followed with any interest the history of the\r\nattempts at a natural classification in any department in nature,\r\nwill see here a fine example of the problems which such attempts\r\npropose, of the {429} difficulties which it may present, and of the\r\nreasonings, labors, cautions, and varied resources, by means of\r\nwhich its solution is sought, when a great philosophical naturalist\r\ngirds himself to the task. We see here, most instructively, how\r\ndifferent the endeavor to frame such a natural system, is from the\r\nprocedure of an artificial system, which carries imperatively\r\nthrough the whole of a class of organized beings, a system of marks\r\neither arbitrary, or conformable to natural affinities in a partial\r\ndegree. And we have not often the advantage of having the reasons\r\nfor a systematic arrangement so clearly and fully indicated, as is\r\ndone here, and in the descriptions of the separate orders.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement Cuvier adhered to in all its main points, both in\r\nthe second edition of the _Règne Animal_, published in 1821, and in\r\nhis _Histoire Naturelle des Poissons_, of which the first volume was\r\npublished in 1828, but which unfortunately was not completed at the\r\ntime of his death. It may be supposed, therefore, to be in\r\naccordance with those views of zoological philosophy, which it was\r\nthe business of his life to form and to apply; and in a work like\r\nthe present, where, upon so large a question of natural history, we\r\nmust be directed in a great measure by the analogy of the history of\r\nscience, and by the judgments which seem most to have the character\r\nof wisdom, we appear to be justified in taking Cuvier's\r\nichthyological system as the nearest approach which has yet been\r\nmade to a natural method in that department.\r\n\r\nThe true natural method is only one: artificial methods, and even\r\ngood ones, there may be many, as we have seen in botany; and each of\r\nthese may have its advantages for some particular use. On some\r\nmethods of this kind, on which naturalists themselves have hardly\r\nyet had time to form a stable and distinct opinion, it is not our\r\noffice to decide. But judging, as I have already said, from the\r\ngeneral analogy of the natural sciences, I find it difficult to\r\nconceive that the ichthyological method of M. Agassiz, recently\r\npropounded with an especial reference to fossil fishes, can be\r\notherwise than an artificial method. It is founded entirely on one\r\npart of the animal, its scaly covering, and even on a single scale.\r\nIt does not conform to that which almost all systematic\r\nichthyologists hitherto have considered as a permanent natural\r\ndistinction of a high order; the distinction of bony and\r\ncartilaginous fishes; for it is stated that each order contains\r\nexamples of both.[154\\16] I do not know what general anatomical or\r\nphysiological {430} truths it brings into view; but they ought to be\r\nvery important and striking ones, to entitle them to supersede those\r\nwhich led Cuvier to his system. To this I may add, that the new\r\nichthyological classification does not seem to form, as we should\r\nexpect that any great advance towards a natural system would form, a\r\nconnected sequel to the past history of ichthyology;--a step to\r\nwhich anterior discoveries and improvements have led, and in which\r\nthey are retained.\r\n\r\n[Note 154\\16: Dr. Buckland's _Bridgewater Treatise_, p. 270.]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these considerations, the method of M. Agassiz\r\nhas probably very great advantages for his purpose; for in the case\r\nof fossil fish, the parts which are the basis of his system often\r\nremain, when even the skeleton is gone. And we may here again refer\r\nto a principle of the classificatory sciences which we cannot make\r\ntoo prominent;--all arrangements and nomenclatures are good, which\r\nenable us to assert general propositions. Tried by this test, we\r\ncannot fail to set a high value on the arrangement of M. Agassiz;\r\nfor propositions of the most striking generality respecting fossil\r\nremains of fish, of which geologists before had never dreamt, are\r\nenunciated by means of his groups and names. Thus only the two first\r\norders, the _Placoïdians_ and _Ganoïdians_, existed before the\r\ncommencement of the cretaceous formation: the third and fourth\r\norders, the _Ctenoïdians_ and _Cycloïdians_, which contain\r\nthree-fourths of the eight thousand known species of living Fishes,\r\nappear for the first time in the cretaceous formation: and other\r\ngeological relations of these orders, no less remarkable, have been\r\nascertained by M. Agassiz.\r\n\r\nBut we have now, I trust, pursued these sciences of classification\r\nsufficiently far; and it is time for us to enter upon that higher\r\ndomain of Physiology to which, as we have said. Zoology so\r\nirresistibly directs us.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I have retained the remarks which I ventured at first to\r\nmake on the System of M. Agassiz; but I believe the opinion of the\r\nmost philosophical ichthyologists to be that Cuvier's System was too\r\nexclusively based on the internal skeleton, as Agassiz's was on the\r\nexternal skeleton. In some degree both systems have been superseded,\r\nwhile all that was true in each has been retained. Mr. Owen, in his\r\n_Lectures on Vertebrata_ (1846), takes Cuvierian characters from the\r\nendo-skeleton, Agassizian ones from the exo-skeleton, Linnæan ones\r\nfrom the ventral fins, Müllerian ones from the air-bladder, and\r\ncombines them by the light of his own researches, with the view of\r\nforming a system more truly natural than any preceding one.\r\n\r\nAs I have said above, naturalists, in their progress towards a\r\nNatural {431} System, are guided by physiological relations,\r\nlatently in Botany, but conspicuously in Zoology.

It was seen, that in\r\nliving things, certain peculiar processes were constantly repeated,\r\nas those of breathing and of taking food, for example; and that a\r\ncertain conformation of the parts of the animal was subservient to\r\nthese processes; and thus were gradually formed the notions of\r\n_Function_ and of _Organization_. And the sciences of which these\r\nnotions formed the basis are clearly distinguishable from all those\r\nwhich we have hitherto considered. We conceive an _organized_ body\r\nto be one in which the parts are there for the sake of the whole, in\r\na manner different from any mechanical or chemical connexion; we\r\nconceive a _function_ to be not merely a process of change, but of\r\nchange connected with the general vital process. When mechanical or\r\nchemical processes occur in the living body, they are instrumental\r\nto, and directed by, the peculiar powers of life. The sciences which\r\nthus consider organization and vital functions may be termed\r\n_organical_ sciences.\r\n\r\nWhen men began to speculate concerning such subjects, the general\r\nmode of apprehending the process in the cases of some functions,\r\nappeared to be almost obvious; thus it was conceived that the growth\r\nof animals arose from their frame appropriating to itself a part of\r\nthe substance of the food through the various passages of the body.\r\nUnder the influence of such general conceptions, speculative men\r\nwere naturally led to endeavor to obtain more clear and definite\r\nviews of the course of each of such processes, and of the mode in\r\nwhich the separate parts contributed to it. Along with the\r\nobservation of the living person, the more searching examination\r\nwhich could be carried on in the dead body, and the comparison of\r\nvarious kinds of animals, soon showed that this pursuit was rich in\r\nknowledge and in interest. {436} Moreover, besides the interest\r\nwhich the mere speculative faculty gave to this study, the Art of\r\nHealing added to it a great practical value; and the effects of\r\ndiseases and of medicines supplied new materials and new motives for\r\nthe reasonings of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nIn this manner anatomy or physiology may be considered as a science\r\nwhich began to be cultivated in the earliest periods of civilization.\r\nLike most other ancient sciences, its career has been one of perpetual\r\nthough variable progress; and as in others, so in this, each step has\r\nimplied those which had been previously made, and cannot be understood\r\naright except we understand them. Moreover, the steps of this advance\r\nhave been very many and diverse; the cultivators of anatomy have in\r\nall ages been numerous and laborious; the subject is one of vast\r\nextent and complexity; almost every generation had added something to\r\nthe current knowledge of its details; and the general speculations of\r\nphysiologists have been subtle, bold, and learned. It must, therefore,\r\nbe difficult or impossible for a person who has not studied the\r\nscience with professional diligence and professional advantages, to\r\nform just judgments of the value of the discoveries of various ages\r\nand persons, and to arrange them in their due relation to each other.\r\nTo this we may add, that though all the discoveries which have been\r\nmade with respect to particular functions or organizations are\r\nunderstood to be subordinate to one general science, the Philosophy of\r\nLife, yet the principles and doctrines of this science nowhere exist\r\nin a shape generally received and assented to among physiologists; and\r\nthus we have not, in this science, the advantage which in some others\r\nwe have possessed;--of discerning the true direction of its first\r\nmovements, by knowing the point to which they ultimately tend;--of\r\nrunning on beyond the earlier discoveries, and thus looking them in\r\nthe face, and reading their true features. With these disadvantages,\r\nall that we can have to say respecting the history of Physiology must\r\nneed great indulgence on the part of the reader.\r\n\r\nYet here, as in other cases, we may, by guiding our views by those\r\nof the greatest and most philosophical men who have made the subject\r\ntheir study, hope to avoid material errors. Nor can we well evade\r\nmaking the attempt. To obtain some simple and consistent view of the\r\nprogress of physiological science, is in the highest degree\r\nimportant to the completion of our views of the progress of physical\r\nscience. For the physiological or organical sciences form a class to\r\nwhich the classes already treated of, the mechanical, chemical, and\r\nclassificatory sciences, are subordinate and auxiliary. Again,\r\nanother {437} circumstance which makes physiology an important part\r\nof our survey of human knowledge is, that we have here a science\r\nwhich is concerned, indeed, about material combinations, but in\r\nwhich we are led almost beyond the borders of the material world,\r\ninto the region of sensation and perception, thought and will. Such\r\na contemplation may offer some suggestions which may prepare us for\r\nthe transition from physical to metaphysical speculations.\r\n\r\nIn the survey which we must, for such purposes, take of the progress\r\nof physiology, it is by no means necessary that we should exhaust\r\nthe subject, and attempt to give the history of every branch of the\r\nknowledge of the phenomena and laws of living creatures. It will be\r\nsufficient, if we follow a few of the lines of such researches,\r\nwhich may be considered as examples of the whole. We see that life\r\nis accompanied and sustained by many processes, which at first offer\r\nthemselves to our notice as separate functions, however they may\r\nafterwards be found to be connected and identified; such are\r\nfeeling, digestion, respiration, the action of the heart and pulse,\r\ngeneration, perception, voluntary motion. The analysis of any one of\r\nthese functions may be pursued separately. And since in this, as in\r\nall genuine sciences, our knowledge becomes real and scientific,\r\nonly in so far as it is verified in particular facts, and thus\r\nestablished in general propositions, such an original separation of\r\nthe subjects of research is requisite to a true representation of\r\nthe growth of real knowledge. The loose hypotheses and systems,\r\nconcerning the connexion of different vital faculties and the\r\ngeneral nature of living things, which have often been promulgated,\r\nmust be excluded from this part of our plan. We do not deny all\r\nvalue and merit to such speculations; but they cannot be admitted in\r\nthe earlier stages of the history of physiology, treated of as an\r\ninductive science. If the doctrine so propounded have a solid and\r\npermanent truth, they will again come before us when we have\r\ntravelled through the range of more limited truths, and are prepared\r\nto ascend with security and certainty into the higher region of\r\ngeneral physiological principles. If they cannot be arrived at by\r\nsuch a road, they are then, however plausible and pleasing, no\r\nportion of that real and progressive science with which alone our\r\nhistory is concerned.\r\n\r\nWe proceed, therefore, to trace the establishment of some of the\r\nmore limited but certain doctrines of physiology. {438}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE ORGANS OF VOLUNTARY MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Knowledge of Galen and his Predecessors._\r\n\r\nIN the earliest conceptions which men entertained of their power of\r\nmoving their own members, they probably had no thought of any\r\nmechanism or organization by which this was effected. The foot and\r\nthe hand, no less than the head, were seen to be endowed with life;\r\nand this pervading life seemed sufficiently to explain the power of\r\nmotion in each part of the frame, without its being held necessary\r\nto seek out a special seat of the will, or instruments by which its\r\nimpulses were made effective. But the slightest inspection of\r\ndissected animals showed that their limbs were formed of a curious\r\nand complex collection of cordage, and communications of various\r\nkinds, running along and connecting the bones of the skeleton. These\r\ncords and communications we now distinguish as muscles, nerves,\r\nveins, arteries, &c.; and among these, we assign to the muscles the\r\noffice of moving the parts to which they are attached, as cords move\r\nthe parts of a machine. Though this action of the muscles on the\r\nbones may now appear very obvious, it was, probably, not at first\r\ndiscerned. It is observed that Homer, who describes the wounds which\r\nare inflicted in his battles with so much apparent anatomical\r\nprecision, nowhere employs the word _muscle_. And even Hippocrates\r\nof Cos, the most celebrated physician of antiquity, is held to have\r\nhad no distinct conception of such an organ.[1\\17] He always employs\r\nthe word _flesh_ when he means _muscle_, and the first explanation\r\nof the latter word (μῦς) occurs in a spurious work ascribed to him.\r\nFor nerves, sinews, ligaments,[2\\17] he used indiscriminately the\r\nsame terms; (τόνος or νεῦρον;) and of these nerves (νεῦρα) he\r\nasserts that they contract the limbs. Nor do we find much more\r\ndistinctness on this subject even in Aristotle, a generation or two\r\nlater. \"The origin of the νεῦρα,\" he says,[3\\17] \"is from the heart;\r\nthey connect {439} the bones, and surround the joints.\" It is clear\r\nthat he means here the muscles, and therefore it is with injustice\r\nthat he has been accused of the gross error of deriving the nerves\r\nfrom the heart. And he is held to have really had the merit[4\\17] of\r\ndiscovering the nerves of sensation, which he calls the \"canals of\r\nthe brain\" (πόροι τοῦ ἐγκεφάλου); but the analysis of the mechanism\r\nof motion is left by him almost untouched. Perhaps his want of sound\r\nmechanical notions, and his constant straining after verbal\r\ngeneralities, and systematic classifications of the widest kind,\r\nsupply the true account of his thus missing the solution of one of\r\nthe simplest problems of Anatomy.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\17: Sprengel, _Geschichte der Arzneikunde_, i. 382.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\17: Sprengel, _Gesch. Arz._ i. 385.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\17: _Hist. Anim._ iii. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\17: Ib. i. 456.]\r\n\r\nIn this, however, as in other subjects, his immediate predecessors\r\nwere far from remedying the deficiencies of his doctrines. Those who\r\nprofessed to study physiology and medicine were, for the most part,\r\nstudious only to frame some general system of abstract principles,\r\nwhich might give an appearance of connexion and profundity to their\r\ntenets. In this manner the successors of Hippocrates became a\r\nmedical school, of great note in its day, designated as the\r\n_Dogmatic_ school;[5\\17] in opposition to which arose an _Empiric_\r\nsect, who professed to deduce their modes of cure, not from\r\ntheoretical dogmas, but from experience. These rival parties\r\nprevailed principally in Asia Minor and Egypt, during the time of\r\nAlexander's successors,--a period rich in names, but poor in\r\ndiscoveries; and we find no clear evidence of any decided advance in\r\nanatomy, such as we are here attempting to trace.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\17: Sprengel, _Gesch. Arz._ i. 583.]\r\n\r\nThe victories of Lucullus and Pompeius, in Greece and Asia, made the\r\nRomans acquainted with the Greek philosophy; and the consequence\r\nsoon was, that shoals of philosophers, rhetoricians, poets, and\r\nphysicians[6\\17] streamed from Greece, Asia Minor, and Egypt, to\r\nRome and Italy, to traffic their knowledge and their arts for Roman\r\nwealth. Among these, was one person whose name makes a great figure\r\nin the history of medicine, Asclepiades of Prusa in Bithynia. This\r\nman appears to have been a quack, with the usual endowments of his\r\nclass;--boldness, singularity, a contemptuous rejection of all\r\npreviously esteemed opinions, a new classification of diseases, a\r\nnew list of medicines, and the assertion of some wonderful cures. He\r\nwould not, on such accounts, deserve a place in the history of\r\nscience, but that he became the founder of a new school, the\r\n_Methodic_, which professed to hold itself separate both from the\r\nDogmatics and the Empirics. {440}\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\17: Sprengel, _Gesch. Arz._ ii. 5.]\r\n\r\nI have noticed these schools of medicine, because, though I am not\r\nable to state distinctly their respective merits in the cultivation\r\nof anatomy, a great progress in that science was undoubtedly made\r\nduring their domination, of which the praise must, I conceive, be in\r\nsome way divided among them. The amount of this progress we are able\r\nto estimate, when we come to the works of Galen, who flourished\r\nunder the Antonines, and died about A.D. 203. The following passage\r\nfrom his works will show that this progress in knowledge was not\r\nmade without the usual condition of laborious and careful\r\nexperiment, while it implies the curious fact of such experiment\r\nbeing conducted by means of family tradition and instruction, so as\r\nto give rise to a _caste_ of dissectors. In the opening of his\r\nSecond Book _On Anatomical Manipulations_, he speaks thus of his\r\npredecessors: \"I do not blame the ancients, who did not write books\r\non anatomical manipulation; though I praise Marinus, who did. For it\r\nwas superfluous for them to compose such records for themselves or\r\nothers, while they were, from their childhood, exercised by their\r\nparents in dissecting, just as familiarly as in writing and reading;\r\nso that there was no more fear of their forgetting their anatomy,\r\nthan of forgetting their alphabet. But when grown men, as well as\r\nchildren, were taught, this thorough discipline fell off; and, the\r\nart being carried out of the family of the Asclepiads, and declining\r\nby repeated transmission, books became necessary for the student.\"\r\n\r\nThat the general structure of the animal frame, as composed of bones\r\nand muscles, was known with great accuracy before the time of Galen,\r\nis manifest from the nature of the mistakes and deficiencies of his\r\npredecessors which he finds it necessary to notice. Thus he\r\nobserves, that some anatomists have made one muscle into two, from\r\nits having two heads;--that they have overlooked some of the muscles\r\nin the face of an ape, in consequence of not skinning the animal\r\nwith their own hands;--and the like. Such remarks imply that the\r\ncurrent knowledge of this kind was tolerably complete. Galen's own\r\nviews of the general mechanical structure of an animal are very\r\nclear and sound. The skeleton, he observes, discharges[7\\17] the\r\noffice of the pole of a tent, or the walls of a house. With respect\r\nto the action of the muscles, his views were anatomically and\r\nmechanically correct; in some instances, he showed what this action\r\nwas, by severing the muscle.[8\\17] He himself added considerably to\r\nthe existing knowledge of {441} this subject; and his discoveries\r\nand descriptions, even of very minute parts of the muscular system,\r\nare spoken of with praise by modern anatomists.[9\\17]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\17: _De Anatom. Administ._ i. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\17: Sprengel, ii. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\17: Sprengel, ii. 150.]\r\n\r\nWe may consider, therefore, that the doctrine of the muscular\r\nsystem, as a collection of cords and sheets, by the contraction of\r\nwhich the parts of the body are moved and supported, was firmly\r\nestablished, and completely followed into detail, by Galen and his\r\npredecessors. But there is another class of organs connected with\r\nvoluntary motion, the nerves, and we must for a moment trace the\r\nopinions which prevailed respecting these. Aristotle, as we have\r\nsaid, noticed some of the nerves of sensation. But Herophilus, who\r\nlived in Egypt in the time of the first Ptolemy, distinguished\r\nnerves as the organs of the will,[10\\17] and Rufus, who lived in the\r\ntime of Trajan,[11\\17] divides the nerves into sensitive and motive,\r\nand derives them all from the brain. But this did not imply that men\r\nhad yet distinguished the nerves from the muscles. Even Galen\r\nmaintained that every muscle consists of a bundle of nerves and\r\nsinews.[12\\17] But the important points, the necessity of the nerve,\r\nand the origination of all this apparatus of motion from the brain,\r\nhe insists upon with great clearness and force. Thus he proved the\r\nnecessity experimentally, by cutting through some of the bundles of\r\nnerves,[13\\17] and thus preventing the corresponding motions. And it\r\nis, he says,[14\\17] allowed by all, both physicians and\r\nphilosophers, that where the origin of the nerve is, there the seat\r\nof the soul (ἡγημονικὸν τῆς ψυχῆς) must be: now this, he adds, is in\r\nthe brain, and not in the heart.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\17: Ib. i. 534.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\17: Ib. ii. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\17: Ibid. ii. 152. Galen, _De Motu Musc._, p. 553.]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\17: Ib. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\17: _De Hippocr. et Plat. Dog._ viii. 1.]\r\n\r\nThus the general construction and arrangement of the organization by\r\nwhich voluntary motion is effected, was well made out at the time of\r\nGalen, and is found distinctly delivered in his works. We cannot,\r\nperhaps, justly ascribe any large portion of the general discovery\r\nto him: indeed, the conception of the mechanism of the skeleton and\r\nmuscles was probably so gradually unfolded in the minds of\r\nanatomical students, that it would be difficult, even if we knew the\r\nlabors of each person, to select one, as peculiarly the author of\r\nthe discovery. But it is clear that all those who did materially\r\ncontribute to the establishment of this doctrine, must have\r\npossessed the qualifications which we find in Galen for such a task;\r\nnamely, clear mechanical views of what the {442} tensions of\r\ncollections of strings could do, and an exact practical acquaintance\r\nwith the muscular cordage which exists in the animal frame;--in\r\nshort, in this as in other instances of real advance in science,\r\nthere must have been clear ideas and real facts, unity of thought\r\nand extent of observation, brought into contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Recognition of Final Causes in Physiology. Galen._\r\n\r\nTHERE is one idea which the researches of the physiologist and the\r\nanatomist so constantly force upon him, that he cannot help assuming\r\nit as one of the guides of his speculations; I mean, the idea of a\r\n_purpose_, or, as it is called in Aristotelian phrase, a _final\r\ncause_, in the arrangements of the animal frame. It is impossible to\r\ndoubt that the motive nerves run along the limbs, _in order that_\r\nthey may convey to the muscles the impulses of the will; and that\r\nthe muscles are attached to the bones, _in order that_ they may move\r\nand support them. This conviction prevails so steadily among\r\nanatomists, that even when the use of any part is altogether\r\nunknown, it is still taken for granted that it has some use. The\r\ndevelopement of this conviction,--of a purpose in the parts of\r\nanimals,--of a function to which each portion of the organization is\r\nsubservient,--contributed greatly to the progress of physiology; for\r\nit constantly urged men forwards in their researches respecting each\r\norgan, till some definite view of its purpose was obtained. The\r\nassumption of hypothetical final causes in Physics may have been, as\r\nBacon asserts it to have been, prejudicial to science; but the\r\nassumption of unknown final causes in Physiology, has given rise to\r\nthe science. The two branches of speculation, Physics and\r\nPhysiology, were equally led, by every new phenomenon, to ask their\r\nquestion, \"Why?\" But, in the former case, \"why\" meant \"through what\r\ncause?\" in the latter, \"for what end?\" And though it may be possible\r\nto introduce into physiology the doctrine of efficient causes, such\r\na step can never obliterate the obligations which the science owes\r\nto the pervading conception of a purpose contained in all\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThis conception makes its appearance very early. Indeed, without any\r\nspecial study of our structure, the thought, that we are fearfully and\r\nwonderfully made, forces itself upon men, with a mysterious\r\nimpressiveness, as a suggestion of our Maker. In this bearing, the\r\nthought is developed to a considerable extent in the well-known\r\npassage in Xenophon's _Conversations of Socrates_. Nor did it ever\r\nlose its hold on sober-minded and instructed men. The Epicureans,\r\nindeed, {443} held that the eye was not made for seeing, nor the ear\r\nfor hearing; and Asclepiades, whom we have already mentioned as an\r\nimpudent pretender, adopted this wild dogma.[15\\17] Such assertions\r\nrequired no labor. \"It is easy,\" says Galen,[16\\17] \"for people like\r\nAsclepiades, when they come to any difficulty, to say that Nature has\r\nworked to no purpose.\" The great anatomist himself pursues his subject\r\nin a very different temper. In a well-known passage, he breaks out\r\ninto an enthusiastic scorn of the folly of the atheistical\r\nnotions.[17\\17] \"Try,\" he says, \"if you can imagine a shoe made with\r\nhalf the skill which appears in the skin of the foot.\" Some one had\r\nspoken of a structure of the human body which he would have preferred\r\nto that which it now has. \"See,\" Galen exclaims, after pointing out\r\nthe absurdity of the imaginary scheme, \"see what brutishness there is\r\nin this wish. But if I were to spend more words on such cattle,\r\nreasonable men might blame me for desecrating my work, which I regard\r\nas a religious hymn in honor of the Creator.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\17: Sprengel, ii. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\17: _De Usu Part._ v. 5, (on the kidneys.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\17: _De Usu Part._ iii. 10.]\r\n\r\nGalen was from the first highly esteemed as an anatomist. He was\r\noriginally of Pergamus; and after receiving the instructions of many\r\nmedical and philosophical professors, and especially of those of\r\nAlexandria, which was then the metropolis of the learned and\r\nscientific world, he came to Rome, where his reputation was soon so\r\ngreat as to excite the envy and hatred of the Roman physicians. The\r\nemperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus would have retained him\r\nnear them; but he preferred pursuing his travels, directed\r\nprincipally by curiosity. When he died, he left behind him numerous\r\nworks, all of them of great value for the light they throw on the\r\nhistory of anatomy and medicine; and these were for a long period\r\nthe storehouse of all the most important anatomical knowledge which\r\nthe world possessed. In the time of intellectual barrenness and\r\nservility, among the Arabians and the Europeans of the dark ages,\r\nthe writings of Galen had almost unquestioned authority;[18\\17] and\r\nit was only by an uncommon effort of independent thinking that\r\nAbdollatif ventured to assert, that even Galen's assertions must\r\ngive way to the evidence of the senses. In more modern times, when\r\nVesalius, in the sixteenth century, accused Galen of mistakes, he\r\ndrew upon himself the hostility of the whole body of physicians. Yet\r\nthe mistakes were such as might have {444} been pointed out and\r\nconfessed[19\\17] without acrimony, if, in times of revolution,\r\nmildness and moderation were possible; but an impatience of the\r\nsuperstition of tradition on the part of the innovators, and an\r\nalarm of the subversion of all recognized truths on the part of the\r\nestablished teachers, inflame and pervert all such discussions.\r\nVesalius's main charge against Galen is, that his dissections were\r\nperformed upon animals, and not upon the human body. Galen himself\r\nspeaks of the dissection of apes as a very familiar employment, and\r\nstates that he killed them by drowning. The natural difficulties\r\nwhich, in various ages, have prevented the unlimited prosecution of\r\nhuman dissection, operated strongly among the ancients, and it would\r\nhave been difficult, under such circumstances, to proceed more\r\njudiciously than Galen did.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\17: Sprengel, ii. 359.]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\17: Cuv. _Leçons sur l'Hist. des Sc. Nat._ p. 25.]\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the history of the discovery of another and\r\nless obvious function, the circulation of the blood, which belongs\r\nto modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Prelude to the Discovery._\r\n\r\nTHE blood-vessels, the veins and arteries, are as evident and\r\npeculiar in their appearance as the muscles; but their function is\r\nby no means so obvious. Hippocrates[20\\17] did not discriminate\r\nVeins and Arteries; both are called by the same name (φλέβες) and\r\nthe word from which artery comes (ἀρτηρίη) means, in his works, the\r\nwindpipe. Aristotle, scanty as was his knowledge of the vessels of\r\nthe body, has yet the merit of having traced the origin of all the\r\nveins to the heart. He expressly contradicts those of his\r\npredecessors who had derived the veins from the head;[21\\17] and\r\nrefers to dissection for the proof. If the book _On the Breath_ be\r\ngenuine (which is doubted), Aristotle was aware of the distinction\r\nbetween veins and arteries. \"Every artery,\" {445} it is there\r\nasserted, \"is accompanied by a vein; the former are filled only with\r\nbreath or air.\"[22\\17] But whether or no this passage be\r\nAristotle's, he held opinions equally erroneous; as, that the\r\nwindpipe conveys air into the heart.[23\\17] Galen[24\\17] was far\r\nfrom having views respecting the blood-vessels, as sound as those\r\nwhich he entertained concerning the muscles. He held the liver to be\r\nthe origin of the veins, and the heart of the arteries. He was,\r\nhowever, acquainted with their junctions, or _anastomoses_. But we\r\nfind no material advance in the knowledge of this subject, till we\r\noverleap the blank of the middle ages, and reach the dawn of modern\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\17: Sprengel, i. 383.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\17: _Hist. Animal._ iii. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\17: _De Spiritu_, v. 1078.]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\17: Spr. i. 501.]\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\17: Ib. ii. 152.]\r\n\r\nThe father of modern anatomy is held to be Mondino,[25\\17] who\r\ndissected and taught at Bologna in 1315. Some writers have traced in\r\nhim the rudiments of the doctrine of the circulation of the blood;\r\nfor he says that the heart transmits blood to the lungs. But it is\r\nallowed, that he afterwards destroys the merit of his remark, by\r\nrepeating the old assertion that the left ventricle ought to contain\r\nspirit or air, which it generates from the blood.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\17: _Encyc. Brit._ 692. Anatomy.]\r\n\r\nAnatomy was cultivated with great diligence and talent in Italy by\r\nAchillini, Carpa, and Messa, and in France by Sylvius and Stephanus\r\n(Dubois and Etienne). Yet still these empty assumptions respecting\r\nthe heart and blood-vessels kept their ground. Vesalius, a native of\r\nBrussels, has been termed the founder of human anatomy, and his\r\ngreat work _De Humani Corporis Fabricâ_ is, even yet, a splendid\r\nmonument of art, as well as science. It is said that his figures\r\nwere designed by Titian; and if this be not exactly true, says\r\nCuvier,[26\\17] they must, at least, be from the pencil of one of the\r\nmost distinguished pupils of the great painter; for to this day,\r\nthough we have more finished drawings, we have no designs that are\r\nmore artist-like. Fallopius, who succeeded Vesalius at Padua, made\r\nsome additions to the researches of his predecessor; but in his\r\ntreatise _De Principio Venarum_, it is clearly seen[27\\17] that the\r\ncirculation of the blood was unknown to him. Eustachius also, whom\r\nCuvier groups with Vesalius and Fallopius, as the three great\r\nfounders of modern anatomy, wrote a treatise on the vein\r\n_azygos_[28\\17] which is a little treatise on comparative anatomy;\r\nbut the discovery of the functions of the veins came from a\r\ndifferent quarter. {446}\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\17: _Leçons sur l'Hist. des Sc. Nat._ p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\17: Cuv. _Sc. Nat._ p. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\17: Ib. p. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Servetus, who was burnt at Geneva as a heretic in\r\n1553, is the first person who speaks distinctly of the small\r\ncirculation, or that which carries the blood from the heart to the\r\nlungs, and back again to the heart. His work entitled _Christianismi\r\nRestitutio_ was also burnt; and only two copies are known to have\r\nescaped the flames. It is in this work that he asserts the doctrine\r\nin question, as a collateral argument or illustration of his\r\nsubject. \"The communication between the right and left ventricle of\r\nthe heart, is made,\" he says, \"not as is commonly believed, through\r\nthe partition of the heart, but by a remarkable artifice (_magno\r\nartificio_) the blood is carried from the right ventricle by a long\r\ncircuit through the lungs; is elaborated by the lungs, made yellow,\r\nand transfused from the _vena arteriosa_ into the _arteria venosa_.\"\r\nThis truth is, however, mixed with various of the traditional\r\nfancies concerning the \"_vital spirit_, which has its origin in the\r\nleft ventricle.\" It may be doubted, also, how far Servetus formed\r\nhis opinion upon conjecture, and on a hypothetical view of the\r\nformation of this vital spirit. And we may, perhaps, more justly\r\nascribe the real establishment of the pulmonary circulation as an\r\ninductive truth, to Realdus Columbus, a pupil and successor of\r\nVesalius at Padua, who published a work _De Re Anatomicâ_ in 1559,\r\nin which he claims this discovery as his own.[29\\17]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\17: _Encyc. Brit._]\r\n\r\nAndrew Cæsalpinus, who has already come under our notice as one of\r\nthe fathers of modern inductive science, both by his metaphysical\r\nand his physical speculations, described the pulmonary circulation\r\nstill more completely in his _Quæstiones Peripateticæ_, and even\r\nseemed to be on the eve of discovering the great circulation; for he\r\nremarked the swelling of veins below ligatures, and inferred from it\r\na refluent motion of blood in these vessels.[30\\17] But another\r\ndiscovery of structure was needed, to prepare the way for this\r\ndiscovery of function; and this was made by Fabricius of\r\nAcquapendente, who succeeded in the grand list of great professors\r\nat Padua, and taught there for fifty years.[31\\17] Sylvius had\r\ndiscovered the existence of the valves of the veins; but Fabricius\r\nremarked that they are all turned towards the heart. Combining this\r\ndisposition with that of the valves of the heart, and with the\r\nabsence of valves in the arteries, he might have come to the\r\nconclusion[32\\17] that the blood moves in a different direction in\r\nthe arteries and in the veins, and might thus have discovered the\r\ncirculation: but this glory was reserved for William Harvey: so true\r\n{447} is it, observes Cuvier, that we are often on the brink of a\r\ndiscovery without suspecting that we are so;--so true is it, we may\r\nadd, that a certain succession of time and of persons is generally\r\nnecessary to familiarize men with one thought, before they can\r\nadvance to that which is the next in order.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\17: Ib.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\17: Cuv. p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\17: p. 45.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_The Discovery of the Circulation made by Harvey._\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HARVEY was born in 1578, at Folkestone in Kent.[33\\17] He\r\nfirst studied at Cambridge: he afterwards went to Padua, where the\r\ncelebrity of Fabricius of Acquapendente attracted from all parts\r\nthose who wished to be instructed in anatomy and physiology. In this\r\ncity, excited by the discovery of the valves of the veins, which his\r\nmaster had recently made, and reflecting on the direction of the\r\nvalves which are at the entrance of the veins into the heart, and at\r\nthe exit of the arteries from it, he conceived the idea of making\r\nexperiments, in order to determine what is the course of the blood\r\nin its vessels. He found that when he tied up veins in various\r\nanimals, they swelled below the ligature, or in the part furthest\r\nfrom the heart; while arteries, with a like ligature, swelled on the\r\nside next the heart. Combining these facts with the direction of the\r\nvalves, he came to the conclusion that the blood is impelled, by the\r\nleft side of the heart, in the arteries to the extremities, and\r\nthence returns by the veins into the right side of the heart. He\r\nshowed, too, how this was confirmed by the phenomena of the pulse,\r\nand by the results of opening the vessels. He proved, also, that the\r\ncirculation of the lungs is a continuation of the larger\r\ncirculation; and thus the whole doctrine of the double circulation\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\17: Cuv. p. 51.]\r\n\r\nHarvey's experiments had been made in 1616 and 1618; it is commonly\r\nsaid that he first promulgated his opinion in 1619; but the\r\nmanuscript of the lectures, delivered by him as lecturer to the\r\nCollege of Physicians, is extant in the British Museum, and,\r\ncontaining the propositions on which the doctrine is founded, refers\r\nthem to April, 1616. It was not till 1628 that he published, at\r\nFrankfort, his _Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis_;\r\nbut he there observes that he had for above nine years confirmed and\r\nillustrated his opinion in his lectures, by arguments grounded upon\r\nocular demonstrations. {448}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Reception of the Discovery._\r\n\r\nWITHOUT dwelling long upon the circumstances of the general reception\r\nof this doctrine, we may observe that it was, for the most part,\r\nreadily accepted by his countrymen, but that abroad it had to\r\nencounter considerable opposition. Although, as we have seen, his\r\npredecessors had approached so near to the discovery, men's minds were\r\nby no means as yet prepared to receive it. Several physicians denied\r\nthe truth of the opinion, among whom the most eminent was Riolan,\r\nprofessor at the Collège de France. Other writers, as usually happens\r\nin the case of great discoveries, asserted that the doctrine was\r\nancient, and even that it was known to Hippocrates. Harvey defended\r\nhis opinion with spirit and temper; yet he appears to have retained a\r\nlively recollection of the disagreeable nature of the struggles in\r\nwhich he was thus involved. At a later period of his life, Ent,[34\\17]\r\none of his admirers, who visited him, and urged him to publish the\r\nresearches on generation, on which he had long been engaged, gives\r\nthis account of the manner in which he received the proposal: \"And\r\nwould you then advise me, (smilingly replies the doctor,) to quit the\r\ntranquillity of this haven, wherein I now calmly spend my days, and\r\nagain commit myself to the unfaithful ocean? You are not ignorant how\r\ngreat troubles my lucubrations, formerly published, have raised.\r\nBetter it is, certainly, at some time, to endeavor to grow wise at\r\nhome in private, than by the hasty divulgation of such things to the\r\nknowledge whereof you have attained with vast labor, to stir up\r\ntempests that may deprive you of your leisure and quiet for the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\17: Epist. Dedic. to _Anatom. Exercit._]\r\n\r\nHis merits were, however, soon generally recognized. He was[35\\17]\r\nmade physician to James the First, and afterwards to Charles the\r\nFirst, and attended that unfortunate monarch in the civil war. He\r\nhad the permission of the parliament to accompany the king on his\r\nleaving London; but this did not protect him from having his house\r\nplundered in his absence, not only of its furniture, but, which he\r\nfelt more, of the records of his experiments. In 1652, his brethren\r\nof the College of Physicians placed a marble bust of him in their\r\nhall, with an inscription recording his discoveries; and two years\r\nlater, he was nominated to the office of President of the College,\r\nwhich however he {449} declined in consequence of his age and\r\ninfirmities. His doctrine soon acquired popular currency; it was,\r\nfor instance, taken by Descartes[36\\17] as the basis of his\r\nphysiology in his work _On Man_; and Harvey had the pleasure, which\r\nis often denied to discoverers, of seeing his discovery generally\r\nadopted during his lifetime.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\17: _Biog. Brit._]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\17: Cuv. 53.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Bearing of the Discovery on the Progress of Physiology._\r\n\r\nIN considering the intellectual processes by which Harvey's\r\ndiscoveries were made, it is impossible not to notice, that the\r\nrecognition of a creative purpose, which, as we have said, appears\r\nin all sound physiological reasonings, prevails eminently here. \"I\r\nremember,\" says Boyle, \"that when I asked our famous Harvey what\r\nwere the things that induced him to think of a circulation of the\r\nblood, he answered me, that when he took notice that the valves in\r\nthe veins of so many parts of the body were so placed, that they\r\ngave a free passage to the blood towards the heart, but opposed the\r\npassage of the venal blood the contrary way; he was incited to\r\nimagine that so provident a cause as Nature had not placed so many\r\nvalves without design; and no design seemed more probable than that\r\nthe blood should be sent through the arteries, and return through\r\nthe veins, whose valves did not oppose its course that way.\"\r\n\r\nWe may notice further, that this discovery implied the usual\r\nconditions, distinct general notions, careful observation of many\r\nfacts, and the mental act of bringing together these elements of\r\ntruth. Harvey must have possessed clear views of the motions and\r\npressures of a fluid circulating in ramifying tubes, to enable him\r\nto see how the position of valves, the pulsation of the heart, the\r\neffects of ligatures, of bleeding, and of other circumstances, ought\r\nto manifest themselves in order to confirm his view. That he\r\nreferred to a multiplied and varied experience for the evidence that\r\nit was so confirmed, we have already said. Like all the best\r\nphilosophers of his time, he insists rigidly upon the necessity of\r\nsuch experience. \"In every science,\" he says,[37\\17] \"be it what it\r\nwill, a diligent observation is requisite, and sense itself must be\r\nfrequently consulted. We must not rely upon other men's experience,\r\nbut our own, without which no man is a proper disciple of any part\r\nof natural knowledge.\" And by publishing his experiments, he trusts,\r\nhe adds, that he has enabled his reader \"to be an equitable {450}\r\numpire between Aristotle and Galen;\" or rather, he might have said,\r\nto see how, in the promotion of science, sense and reason,\r\nobservation and invention, have a mutual need of each other.\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\17: _Generation of Animals_, Pref.]\r\n\r\nWe may observe further, that though Harvey's glory, in the case now\r\nbefore us, rested upon his having proved the reality of certain\r\nmechanical movements and actions in the blood, this discovery, and\r\nall other physiological truths, necessarily involved the assumption\r\nof some peculiar agency belonging to living things, different both\r\nfrom mechanical agency, and from chemical; and in short, something\r\n_vital_, and not physical merely. For when it was seen that the\r\npulsation of the heart, its _systole_ and _diastole_, caused the\r\ncirculation of the blood, it might still be asked, what force caused\r\nthis constantly-recurring contraction and expansion. And again,\r\ncirculation is closely connected with respiration; the blood is, by\r\nthe circulation, carried to the lungs, and is there, according to\r\nthe expression of Columbus and Harvey, mixed with air. But by what\r\nmechanism does this _mixture_ take place, and what is the real\r\nnature of it? And when succeeding researches had enabled\r\nphysiologists to give an answer to this question, as far as chemical\r\nrelations go, and to say, that the change consists in the\r\nabstraction of the carbon from the blood by means of the oxygen of\r\nthe atmosphere; they were still only led to ask further, how this\r\nchemical change was effected, and how such a change of the blood\r\nfitted it for its uses. Every function of which we explain the\r\ncourse, the mechanism, or the chemistry, is connected with other\r\nfunctions,--is subservient to them, and they to it; and all together\r\nare parts of the general vital system of the animal, ministering to\r\nits life, but deriving their activity from the life. Life is not a\r\ncollection of forces, or polarities, or affinities, such as any of\r\nthe physical or chemical sciences contemplate; it has powers of its\r\nown, which often supersede those subordinate relations; and in the\r\ncases where men have traced such agents in the animal frame, they\r\nhave always seen, and usually acknowledged, that these agents were\r\nministerial to some higher agency, more difficult to trace than\r\nthese, but more truly the cause of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the mechanical and chemical conditions of the vital\r\nfunctions, as a step in physiology, may be compared to the discovery\r\nof the laws of phenomena in the heavens by Kepler and his\r\npredecessors, while the discovery of the force by which they were\r\nproduced was still reserved in mystery for Newton to bring to light.\r\nThe subordinate relation of the facts, their **dependence on space\r\nand time, their reduction to order and cycle, had been fully\r\nperformed; but the {451} reference of them to distinct ideas of\r\ncausation, their interpretation as the results of mechanical force,\r\nwas omitted or attempted in vain. The very notion of such Force, and\r\nof the manner in which motions were determined by it, was in the\r\nhighest degree vague and vacillating; and a century was requisite,\r\nas we have seen, to give to the notion that clearness and fixity\r\nwhich made the Mechanics of the Heavens a possible science. In like\r\nmanner, the notion of Life, and of Vital Forces, is still too\r\nobscure to be steadily held. We cannot connect it distinctly with\r\nsevere inductions from facts. We can trace the motions of the animal\r\nfluids as Kepler traced the motions of the planets; but when we seek\r\nto render a reason for these motions, like him, we recur to terms of\r\na wide and profound, but mysterious import; to Virtues, Influences,\r\nundefined Powers. Yet we are not on this account to despair. The\r\nvery instance to which I am referring shows us how rich is the\r\npromise of the future. Why, says Cuvier,[38\\17] may not Natural\r\nHistory one day have its Newton? The idea of the vital forces may\r\ngradually become so clear and definite as to be available in\r\nscience; and future generations may include, in their physiology,\r\npropositions elevated as far above the circulation of the blood, as\r\nthe doctrine of universal gravitation goes beyond the explanation of\r\nthe heavenly motions by epicycles.\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\17: _Ossem. Foss._ Introd.]\r\n\r\nIf, by what has been said, I have exemplified sufficiently the\r\nnature of those steps in physiology, which, like the discovery of\r\nthe Circulation, give an explanation of the process of some of the\r\nanimal functions, it is not necessary for me to dwell longer on the\r\nsubject; for to write a history, or even a sketch of the history of\r\nPhysiology, would suit neither my powers nor my purpose. Some\r\nfurther analysis of the general views which have been promulgated by\r\nthe most eminent physiologists, may perhaps be attempted in treating\r\nof the Philosophy of Inductive Science; but the estimation of the\r\nvalue of recent speculations and investigations must be left to\r\nthose who have made this vast subject the study of their lives. A\r\nfew brief notices may, however, be here introduced. {452}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE MOTION OF THE CHYLE, AND CONSEQUENT SPECULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_The Discovery of the Motion of the Chyle._\r\n\r\nIT may have been observed in the previous course of this History of\r\nthe Sciences, that the discoveries in each science have a peculiar\r\nphysiognomy: something of a common type may be traced in the\r\nprogress of each of the theories belonging to the same department of\r\nknowledge. We may notice something of this common form in the\r\nvarious branches of physiological speculation. In most, or all of\r\nthem, we have, as we have noticed the case to be with respect to the\r\ncirculation of the blood, clear and certain discoveries of\r\nmechanical and chemical processes, succeeded by speculations far\r\nmore obscure, doubtful, and vague, respecting the relation of these\r\nchanges to the laws of life. This feature in the history of\r\nphysiology may be further instanced, (it shall be done very\r\nbriefly), in one or two other cases. And we may observe, that the\r\nlesson which we are to collect from this narrative, is by no means\r\nthat we are to confine ourselves to the positive discovery, and\r\nreject all the less clear and certain speculations. To do this,\r\nwould be to lose most of the chances of ulterior progress; for\r\nthough it may be, that our conceptions of the nature of organic life\r\nare not yet sufficiently precise and steady to become the guides to\r\npositive inductive truths, still the only way in which these\r\npeculiar physiological ideas can be made more distinct and precise,\r\nand thus brought more nearly into a scientific form, is by this\r\nstruggle with our ignorance or imperfect knowledge. This is the\r\nlesson we have learnt from the history of physical astronomy and\r\nother sciences. We must strive to refer facts which are known and\r\nunderstood, to higher principles, of which we cannot doubt the\r\nexistence, and of which, in some degree, we can see the place;\r\nhowever dim and shadowy may be the glimpses we have hitherto been\r\nable to obtain of their forms. We may often fail in such attempts,\r\nbut without the attempt we can never succeed. {453}\r\n\r\nThat the food is received into the stomach, there undergoes a change\r\nof its consistence, and is then propelled along the intestines, are\r\nobvious facts in the animal economy. But a discovery made in the\r\ncourse of the seventeenth century brought into clearer light the\r\nsequel of this series of processes, and its connexion with other\r\nfunctions. In the year 1622, Asellius or Aselli[39\\17] discovered\r\ncertain minute vessels, termed _lacteals_, which absorb a white\r\nliquid (the _chyle_) from the bowels, and pour it into the blood.\r\nThese vessels had, in fact, been discovered by Eristratus, in the\r\nancient world,[40\\17] in the time of Ptolemy; but Aselli was the\r\nfirst modern who attended to them. He described them in a treatise\r\nentitled _De Venis Lacteis, cum figuris elegantissimis_, printed at\r\nMilan in 1627, the year after the death of the author. The work is\r\nremarkable as the first which exhibits _colored_ anatomical figures;\r\nthe arteries and veins are represented in red, the lacteals in black.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\17: Mayo, _Physiology_, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\17: Cuv. _Hist. Sc._ p. 50.]\r\n\r\nEustachius,[41\\17] at an earlier period, had described (in the\r\nhorse) the thoracic duct by which the chyle is poured into the\r\nsubclavian vein, on the right side of the neck. But this description\r\ndid not excite so much notice as to prevent its being forgotten, and\r\nrediscovered in 1550, after the knowledge of the circulation of the\r\nblood had given more importance to such a discovery. Up to this\r\ntime,[42\\17] it had been supposed that the lacteals carried the\r\nchyle to the liver, and that the blood was manufactured there. This\r\nopinion had prevailed in all the works of the ancients and moderns;\r\nits falsity was discovered by Pecquet, a French physician, and\r\npublished in 1651, in his _New Anatomical Experiments_; in which are\r\ndiscovered a receptacle of the chyle, unknown till then, and the\r\nvessel which conveys it to the subclavian vein. Pecquet himself and\r\nother anatomists, soon connected this discovery with the doctrine,\r\nthen recently promulgated, of the circulation of the blood. In 1665,\r\nthese vessels, and the _lymphatics_ which are connected with them,\r\nwere further illustrated by Ruysch in his exhibition of their\r\nvalves. (_Dilucidatio valvularum in vasis lymphaticis et lacteis_.)\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\17: Cuv. _Hist._ p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\17: Ib. p. 365.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_The Consequent Speculations. Hypotheses of Digestion._\r\n\r\nTHUS it was shown that aliments taken into the stomach are, by its\r\naction, made to produce _chyme_; from the chyme, gradually changed\r\n{454} in its progress through the intestines, _chyle_ is absorbed by\r\nthe lacteals; and this, poured into the blood by the thoracic duct,\r\nrepairs the waste and nourishes the growth of the animal. But by\r\nwhat powers is the food made to undergo these transformations? Can\r\nwe explain them on mechanical or on chemical principles? Here we\r\ncome to a part of physiology less certain than the discovery of\r\nvessels, or of the motion of fluids. We have a number of opinions on\r\nthis subject, but no universally acknowledged truth. We have a\r\ncollection of _Hypotheses of Digestion_ and _Nutrition_.\r\n\r\nI shall confine myself to the former class; and without dwelling\r\nlong upon these, I shall mention some of them. The philosophers of\r\nthe Academy _del Cimento_, and several others, having experimented\r\non the stomach of gallinaceous birds, and observed the astonishing\r\nforce with which it breaks and grinds substances, were led to\r\nconsider the digestion which takes place in the stomach as a kind of\r\n_trituration_.[43\\17] Other writers thought it was more properly\r\ndescribed as _fermentation_; others again spoke of it as a\r\n_putrefaction_. Varignon gave a merely physical account of the first\r\npart of the process, maintaining that the division of the aliments\r\nwas the effect of the disengagement of the air introduced into the\r\nstomach, and dilated by the heat of the body. The opinion that\r\ndigestion is a _solution_ of the food by the gastric juice has been\r\nmore extensively entertained.\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\17: Bourdon, _Physiol. Comp._ p. 514.]\r\n\r\nSpallanzani and others made many experiments on this subject. Yet it\r\nis denied by the best physiologists, that the changes of digestion\r\ncan be adequately represented as chemical changes only. The nerves\r\nof the stomach (the _pneumo-gastric_) are said to be essential to\r\ndigestion. Dr. Wilson Philip has asserted that the influence of\r\nthese nerves, when they are destroyed, may be replaced by a galvanic\r\ncurrent.[44\\17] This might give rise to a supposition that digestion\r\ndepends on galvanism. Yet we cannot doubt that all these\r\nhypotheses,--mechanical, physical, chemical, galvanic--are\r\naltogether insufficient. \"The stomach must have,\" as Dr. Prout\r\nsays,[45\\17] \"the power of {455} organizing and vitalizing the\r\ndifferent elementary substances. It is impossible to imagine that\r\nthis organizing agency of the stomach can be chemical. This agency\r\nis _vital_, and its nature completely unknown.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\17: Müller (_Manual of Physiology_, B. iii. Sect. 1, Chap.\r\niii.) speaks of Dr. Wilson Philip's assertion that the nerves of the\r\nstomach being cut, and a galvanic current kept up in them, digestion\r\nis still accomplished. He states that he and other physiologists\r\nhave repeated such experiments on an extensive scale, and have found\r\nno effect of this kind.]\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\17:  _Bridgewater Tr._ p. 493.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE PROCESS OF REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS,\r\nAND CONSEQUENT SPECULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_The Examination of the Process of Reproduction in\r\nAnimals._\r\n\r\nIT would not, perhaps, be necessary to give any more examples of\r\nwhat has hitherto been the general process of investigations on each\r\nbranch of physiology; or to illustrate further the combination which\r\nsuch researches present, of certain with uncertain knowledge;--of\r\nsolid discoveries of organs and processes, succeeded by indefinite\r\nand doubtful speculation concerning vital forces. But the\r\nreproduction of organized beings is not only a subject of so much\r\ninterest as to require some notice, but also offers to us laws and\r\nprinciples which include both the vegetable and the animal kingdom;\r\nand which, therefore, are requisite to render intelligible the most\r\ngeneral views to which we can attain, respecting the world of\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe facts and laws of reproduction were first studied in detail in\r\nanimals. The subject appears to have attracted the attention of some\r\nof the philosophers of antiquity in an extraordinary degree: and\r\nindeed we may easily imagine that they hoped, by following this\r\npath, if any, to solve the mystery of creation. Aristotle appears to\r\nhave pursued it with peculiar complacency; and his great work _On\r\nanimals_ contains[46\\17] an extraordinary collection of curious\r\nobservations relative to this subject. He had learnt the modes of\r\nreproduction of most of the animals with which he was acquainted;\r\nand his work is still, as a writer of our own times has said,[47\\17]\r\n\"original after so many copies, and young after two thousand years.\"\r\nHis observations referred principally to the external circumstances\r\nof generation: the anatomical examination was {456} left to his\r\nsuccessors. Without dwelling on the intermediate labors, we come to\r\nmodern times, and find that this examination owes its greatest\r\nadvance to those who had the greatest share in the discovery of the\r\ncirculation of the blood;--Fabricius of Acquapendente, and Harvey.\r\nThe former[48\\17] published a valuable work on the Egg and the\r\nChick. In this are given, for the first time, figures representing\r\nthe developement of the chick, from its almost imperceptible\r\nbeginning, to the moment when it breaks the shell. Harvey pursued\r\nthe researches of his teacher. Charles[49\\17] the First had supplied\r\nhim with the means of making the experiments which his purpose\r\nrequired, by sacrificing a great number of the deer in Windsor Park\r\nin the state of gestation: but his principal researches were those\r\nrespecting the egg, in which he followed out the views of Fabricius.\r\nIn the troubles which succeeded the death of the unfortunate Charles\r\nthe house of Harvey was pillaged; and he lost the whole of the\r\nlabors he had bestowed on the generation of insects. His work,\r\n_Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium_, was published at London\r\nin 1651; it is more detailed and perfect than that of Fabricius; but\r\nthe author was prevented by the unsettled condition of the country\r\nfrom getting figures engraved to accompany his descriptions.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\17: Bourdon, p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\17: Ib. p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\17: Cuv. _Hist. Sc. Nat._ p. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\17: Ib. p. 53.]\r\n\r\nMany succeeding anatomists pursued the examination of the series of\r\nchanges in generation, and of the organs which are concerned in\r\nthem, especially Malpighi, who employed the microscope in this\r\ninvestigation, and whose work on the Chick was published in 1673. It\r\nis impossible to give here any general view of the result of these\r\nlaborious series of researches: but we may observe, that they led to\r\nan extremely minute and exact survey of all the parts of the fœtus,\r\nits envelopes and appendages, and, of course, to a designation of\r\nthese by appropriate names. These names afterwards served to mark\r\nthe attempts which were made to carry the analogy of animal\r\ngeneration into the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThere is one generalization of Harvey which deserves notice.[50\\17]\r\nHe was led by his researches to the conclusion, that all living\r\nthings may be properly said to come from eggs: \"Omne vivum ex ovo.\"\r\nThus not only do oviparous animals produce by means of eggs, but in\r\nthose which are viviparous, the process of generation begins with\r\nthe developement of a small vesicle, which comes from the ovary, and\r\nwhich exists before the embryo: and thus viviparous or\r\nsuckling-beasts, {457} notwithstanding their name, are born from\r\neggs, as well as birds, fishes, and reptiles.[51\\17] This principle\r\nalso excludes that supposed production of organized beings without\r\nparents (of worms in corrupted matter, for instance,) which was\r\nformerly called _spontaneous generation_; and the best physiologists\r\nof modern times agree in denying the reality of such a mode of\r\ngeneration.[52\\17]\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\17: Exerc. lxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\17: Bourdon, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\17: Ib. p. 49.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_The Examination of the Process of Reproduction in\r\nVegetables._\r\n\r\nTHE extension of the analogies of animal generation to the vegetable\r\nworld was far from obvious. This extension was however made;--with\r\nreference to the embryo plant, principally by the microscopic\r\nobservers, Nehemiah Grew, Marcello Malpighi, and Antony\r\nLeeuwenhoek;--with respect to the existence of the sexes, by Linnæus\r\nand his predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic labors of Grew and Malpighi were patronized by the\r\nRoyal Society of London in its earliest youth. Grew's book, _The\r\nAnatomy of Plants_, was ordered to be printed in 1670. It contains\r\nplates representing extremely well the process of germination in\r\nvarious seeds, and the author's observations exhibit a very clear\r\nconception of the relation and analogies of different portions of\r\nthe seed. On the day on which the copy of this work was laid before\r\nthe Society, a communication from Malpighi of Bologna, _Anatomes\r\nPlantarum Idea_, stated his researches, and promised figures which\r\nshould illustrate them. Both authors afterwards went on with a long\r\ntrain of valuable observations, which they published at various\r\ntimes, and which contain much that has since become a permanent\r\nportion of the science.\r\n\r\nBoth Grew and Malpighi were, as we have remarked, led to apply to\r\nvegetable generation many terms which imply an analogy with the\r\ngeneration of animals. Thus, Grew terms the innermost coat of the\r\nseed, the _secundine_; speaks of the _navel-fibres_, &c. Many more\r\nsuch terms have been added by other writers. And, as has been\r\nobserved by a modern physiologist,[53\\17] the resemblance is\r\nstriking. Both in the vegetable seed and in the fertilized animal\r\negg, we have an _embryo_, _chalazæ_, a _placenta_, an _umbilical\r\ncord_, a _cicatricula_, an _amnios_, _membranes_, _nourishing\r\nvessels_. The _cotyledons_ of the seed are the equivalent of the\r\n_vitellus_ of birds, or of the _umbilical vesicle_ of\r\n**suckling-beasts: {458} the _albumen_ or _perisperm_ of the grain is\r\nanalogous to the _white of the egg_ of birds, or the _allantoid_ of\r\nviviparous animals.\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\17: Ib. p. 384.]\r\n\r\n_Sexes of Plants._--The attribution of sexes to plants, is a notion\r\nwhich was very early adopted; but only gradually unfolded into\r\ndistinctness and generality.[54\\17] The ancients were acquainted\r\nwith the fecundation of vegetables. Empedocles, Aristotle,\r\nTheophrastus, Pliny, and some of the poets, make mention of it; but\r\ntheir notions were very incomplete, and the conception was again\r\nlost in the general shipwreck of human knowledge. A Latin poem,\r\ncomposed in the fifteenth century by Jovianus Pontanus, the\r\npreceptor of Alphonso, King of Naples, is the first modern work in\r\nwhich mention is made of the sex of plants. Pontanus sings the loves\r\nof two date-palms, which grew at the distance of fifteen leagues\r\nfrom each other: the male at Brundusium, the female at Otranto. The\r\ndistance did not prevent the female from becoming fruitful, as soon\r\nas the palms had raised their heads above the surrounding trees, so\r\nthat nothing intervened directly between them, or, to speak with the\r\npoet, so that they were able to see each other.\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\17: Mirbel, _El._ ii. 538.]\r\n\r\nZaluzian, a botanist who lived at the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nsays that the greater part of the species of plants are\r\n_androgynes_, that is, have the properties of the male and of the\r\nfemale united in the same plant; but that some species have the two\r\nsexes in separate individuals; and he adduces a passage of Pliny\r\nrelative to the fecundation of the date-palm. John Bauhin, in the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, cites the expressions of\r\nZaluzian; and forty years later, a professor of Tübingen, Rudolph\r\nJacob Camerarius, pointed out clearly the organs of generation, and\r\nproved by experiments on the mulberry, on maize, and on the plant\r\ncalled Mercury (_mercurialis_), that when by any means the action of\r\nthe stamina upon the pistils is intercepted, the seeds are barren.\r\nCamerarius, therefore, a philosopher in other respects of little\r\nnote, has the honor assigned him of being the author of the\r\ndiscovery of the sexes of plants in modern times.[55\\17]\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\17: Mirbel, ii. 539.]\r\n\r\nThe merit of this discovery will, perhaps, appear more considerable\r\nwhen it is recollected that it was rejected at first by very eminent\r\nbotanists. Thus Tournefort, misled by insufficient experiments,\r\nmaintained that the stamina are excretory organs; and Reaumur, at\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century, inclined to the same\r\ndoctrine. {459} Upon this, Geoffroy, an apothecary at Paris,\r\nscrutinized afresh the sexual organs; he examined the various forms\r\nof the pollen, already observed by Grew and Malpighi; he pointed out\r\nthe excretory canal, which descends through the style, and the\r\n_micropyle_, or minute orifice in the coats of the ovule, which is\r\nopposite to the extremity of this canal; though he committed some\r\nmistakes with regard to the nature of the pollen. Soon afterwards,\r\nSebastian Vaillant, the pupil of Tournefort, but the corrector of\r\nhis error on this subject, explained in his public lectures the\r\nphenomenon of the fecundation of plants, described the explosion of\r\nthe anthers, and showed that the _florets_ of composite flowers,\r\nthough formed on the type of an _androgynous_ flower, are sometimes\r\nmale, sometimes female, and sometimes neuter.\r\n\r\nBut though the sexes of plants had thus been noticed, the subject\r\ndrew far more attention when Linnæus made the sexual parts the basis\r\nof his classification. Camerarius and Burkard had already\r\nentertained such a thought, but it was Linnæus who carried into\r\neffect, and thus made the notion of the sexes of vegetables almost\r\nas familiar to us as that of the sexes of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_The Consequent Speculations.--Hypotheses of Generation._\r\n\r\nTHE views of the processes of generation, and of their analogies\r\nthroughout the whole of the organic world, which were thus\r\nestablished and diffused, form an important and substantial part of\r\nour physiological knowledge. That a number of curious but doubtful\r\nhypotheses should be put forward, for the purpose of giving further\r\nsignificance and connexion to these discoveries, was to be expected.\r\nWe must content ourselves with speaking of these very briefly. We\r\nhave such hypotheses in the earliest antiquity of Greece; for as we\r\nhave already said, the speculations of cosmogony were the source of\r\nthe Greek philosophy; and the laws of generation appeared to offer\r\nthe best promise of knowledge respecting the mystery of creation.\r\nHippocrates explained the production of a new animal by the _mixture\r\nof seed_ of the parents; and the offspring was male or female as the\r\nseminal principle of the father or of the mother was the more\r\npowerful. According to Aristotle, the mother supplied the _matter_,\r\nand the father the _form_. Harvey's doctrine was, that the ovary of\r\nthe female is fertilized by a _seminal contagion_ produced by the\r\nseed of the male. But an opinion which obtained far more general\r\nreception was, that {460} the _embryo pre-existed_ in the mother,\r\nbefore any union of the sexes.[56\\17] It is easy to see that this\r\ndoctrine is accompanied with great difficulties;[57\\17] for if the\r\nmother, at the beginning of life, contain in her the embryos of all\r\nher future children; these embryos again must contain the children\r\nwhich they are capable of producing; and so on indefinitely; and\r\nthus each female of each species contains in herself the germs of\r\ninfinite future generations. The perplexity which is involved in\r\nthis notion of an endless series of creatures, thus encased one\r\nwithin another, has naturally driven inquirers to attempt other\r\nsuppositions. The microscopic researches of Leeuwenhoek and others\r\nled them to the belief that there are certain animalcules contained\r\nin the seed of the male, which are the main agents in the work of\r\nreproduction. This system ascribes almost everything to the male, as\r\nthe one last mentioned does to the female. Finally, we have the\r\nsystem of Buffon;--the famous hypothesis of _organic molecules_.\r\nThat philosopher asserted that he found, by the aid of the\r\nmicroscope, all nature full of moving globules, which he conceived\r\nto be, not animals as Leeuwenhoek imagined, but bodies capable of\r\nproducing, by their combination, either animals or vegetables, in\r\nshort, all organized bodies. These globules he called _organic\r\nmolecules_.[58\\17] And if we inquire how these organic molecules,\r\nproceeding from all parts of the two parents, unite into a whole, as\r\nperfect as either of the progenitors, Buffon answers, that this is\r\nthe effect of the _interior mould_; that is, of a system of internal\r\nlaws and tendencies which determine the form of the result as an\r\nexternal mould determines the shape of the cast.\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\17: Bourdon, p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\17: Ib. p. 209.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\17: Ib. p. 219.]\r\n\r\nAn admirer of Buffon, who has well shown the untenable character of\r\nthis system, has urged, as a kind of apology for the promulgation of\r\nthe hypothesis,[59\\17] that at the period when its author wrote, he\r\ncould not present his facts with any hope of being attended to, if he\r\ndid not connect them by some common tie, some dominant idea which\r\nmight gratify the mind; and that, acting under this necessity, he did\r\nwell to substitute for the extant theories, already superannuated and\r\nconfessedly imperfect, conjectures more original and more probable.\r\nWithout dissenting from this view, we may observe, that Buffon's\r\ntheory, like those which preceded it, is excusable, and even deserving\r\nof admiration, so far as it groups the facts consistently; because in\r\ndoing this, it exhibits the necessity, which the physiological\r\nspeculator ought to feel, of aspiring to definite and solid general\r\nprinciples; and that thus, though {461} the theory may not be\r\nestablished as true, it may be useful by bringing into view the real\r\nnature and application of such principles.\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\17: Ib. p. 221.]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, according to our views, unphilosophical to derive\r\ndespair, instead of hope, from the imperfect success of Buffon and\r\nhis predecessors. Yet this is what is done by the writer to whom we\r\nrefer. \"For me,\" says he,[60\\17] \"I vow that, after having long\r\nmeditated on the system of Buffon,--a system so remarkable, so\r\ningenious, so well matured, so wonderfully connected in all its\r\nparts, at first sight so probable;--I confess that, after this long\r\nstudy, and the researches which it requires, I have conceived in\r\nconsequence, a distrust of myself a skepticism, a disdain of\r\nhypothetical systems, a decided predilection and exclusive taste for\r\npure and rational observation, in short, a disheartening, which I\r\nhad never felt before.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\17: Bourdon, p. 274.]\r\n\r\nThe best remedy of such feelings is to be found in the history of\r\nscience. Kepler, when he had been driven to reject the solid\r\nepicycles of the ancients, or a person who had admired Kepler as M.\r\nBourdon admires Buffon, but who saw that his magnetic virtue was an\r\nuntenable fiction, might, in the same manner, have thrown up all\r\nhope of a sound theory of the causes of the celestial motions. But\r\nastronomers were too wise and too fortunate to yield to such\r\ndespondency. The predecessors of Newton substituted a solid science\r\nof Mechanics for the vague notions of Kepler; and the time soon came\r\nwhen Newton himself reduced the motions of the heavens to a Law as\r\ndistinctly conceived as the Motions had been before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND CONSEQUENT SPECULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_The Examination of the Nervous System._\r\n\r\nIT is hardly necessary to illustrate by further examples the manner\r\nin which anatomical observation has produced conjectural and\r\nhypothetical attempts to connect structure and action with some\r\n{462} higher principle, of a more peculiarly physiological kind. But\r\nit may still be instructive to notice a case in which the principle,\r\nwhich is thus brought into view, is far more completely elevated\r\nabove the domain of matter and mechanism than in those we have yet\r\nconsidered;--a case where we have not only Irritation, but\r\nSensation;--not only Life, but Consciousness and Will. A part of\r\nscience in which suggestions present themselves, brings us, in a\r\nvery striking manner, to the passage from the physical to the\r\nhyperphysical sciences.\r\n\r\nWe have seen already (chap. i.) that Galen and his predecessors had\r\nsatisfied themselves that the nerves are the channels of perception; a\r\ndoctrine which had been distinctly taught by Herophilus[61\\17] in the\r\nAlexandrian school. Herophilus, however, still combined, under the\r\ncommon name of Nerves, the Tendons; though he distinguished such\r\nNerves from those which arise from the brain and the spinal marrow,\r\nand which are subservient to the will. In Galen's time this subject\r\nhad been prosecuted more into detail. That anatomist has left a\r\nTreatise expressly upon _The Anatomy of the Nerves_; in which he\r\ndescribes the successive _Pairs_ of Nerves: thus, the First Pair are\r\nthe visual nerves: and we see, in the language which Galen uses, the\r\nevidence of the care and interest with which he had himself examined\r\nthem. \"These nerves,\" he says, \"are not resolved into many fibres,\r\nlike all the other nerves, when they reach the organs to which they\r\nbelong; but spread out in a different and very remarkable manner,\r\nwhich it is not easy to describe or to believe, without actually\r\nseeing it.\" He then gives a description of the retina. In like manner\r\nhe describes the Second Pair, which is distributed to the muscles of\r\nthe eyes; the Third and Fourth Pairs, which go to the tongue and\r\npalate; and so on to the Seventh Pair. This division into Seven Pairs\r\nwas established by Marinus,[62\\17] but Vesalius found it to be\r\nincomplete. The examination which is the basis of the anatomical\r\nenumeration of the Nerves at present recognized was that of Willis.\r\nHis book, entitled _Cerebri Anatome, cui accessit Nervorum descriptio\r\net usus_, appeared at London in 1664. He made important additions to\r\nthe knowledge of this subject.[63\\17] Thus he is the first who\r\ndescribes in a distinct manner what has been called the _Nervous\r\nCentre_,[64\\17] the pyramidal eminences which, according to more\r\nrecent anatomists, are the communication of the brain with the spinal\r\nmarrow: and of which the _Decussation_, described by Santorini,\r\naffords the explanation of the action of a part {463} of the brain\r\nupon the nerves of the opposite side. Willis proved also that the\r\n_Rete Mirabile_, the remarkable net-work of arteries at the base of\r\nthe brain, observed by the ancients in ruminating animals, does not\r\nexist in man. He described the different Pairs of Nerves with more\r\ncare than his predecessors; and his mode of numbering them is employed\r\nup to the present time. He calls the Olfactory Nerves the First Pair;\r\npreviously to him, these were not reckoned a Pair: and thus the optic\r\nnerves were, as we have seen, called the first. He added the Sixth and\r\nthe Ninth Pairs, which the anatomists who preceded him did not reckon.\r\nWillis also examined carefully the different _Ganglions_, or knots\r\nwhich occur upon the nerves. He traced them wherever they were to be\r\nfound, and he gave a general figure of what Cuvier calls the _nervous\r\nskeleton_, very superior to that of Vesalius, which was coarse and\r\ninexact. Willis also made various efforts to show the connexion of the\r\nparts of the brain. In the earlier periods of anatomy, the brain had\r\nbeen examined by slicing it, so as to obtain a section. Varolius\r\nendeavored to unravel it, and was followed by Willis. Vicq d'Azyr, in\r\nmodern times, has carried the method of section to greater perfection\r\nthan had before been given it;[65\\17] as Vieussens and Gall have done\r\nwith respect to the method of Varolius and Willis. Recently Professor\r\nChaussier[66\\17] makes three kinds of Nerves:--the _Encephalic_, which\r\nproceed from the head, and are twelve on each side;--the _Rachidian_,\r\nwhich proceed from the spinal marrow, and are thirty on each\r\nside;--and _Compound Nerves_, among which is the _Great Sympathetic_\r\nNerve.\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\17: Spr. i. 534.]\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\17: _Dic. Sc. Med._ xxxv. 467.]\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\17: Cuv. _Sc. Nat._ p. 385.]\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\17: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\17: Cuv. p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\17: _Dict. Sc. Nat._ xxxv. 467.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important steps ever made in our knowledge of the\r\nnerves is, the distinction which Bichat is supposed to have\r\nestablished, of a _ganglionic system_, and a _cerebral system_. And\r\nwe may add, to the discoveries in nervous anatomy, the remarkable\r\none, made in our own time, that the two offices--of conducting the\r\nmotive impressions from the central seat of the will to the muscles,\r\nand of propagating sensations from the surface of the body and the\r\nexternal organs of sense to the sentient mind--reside in two\r\ndistinct portions of the nervous substance:--a discovery which has\r\nbeen declared[67\\17] to be \"doubtless the most important accession\r\nto physiological (anatomical) knowledge since the time of Harvey.\"\r\nThis doctrine was first published and taught by Sir Charles Bell:\r\nafter an interval of some {464} years, it was more distinctly\r\ndelivered in the publications of Mr. John Shaw, Sir C. Bell's pupil.\r\nSoon afterwards it was further confirmed, and some part of the\r\nevidence corrected, by Mr. Mayo, another pupil of Sir C. Bell, and\r\nby M. Majendie.[68\\17]\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\17: Dr. Charles Henry's _Report of Brit. Assoc._ iii.\r\np. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\17: As authority for the expressions which I have now used\r\nin the text, I will mention Müller's _Manual of Physiology_ (4th\r\nedition, 1844). In Book iii. Section 2, Chap. i., \"On the Nerves of\r\nSensation and Motion,\" Müller says, \"Charles Bell was the first who\r\nhad the ingenious thought that the posterior roots of the nerves of\r\nthe spine--those which are furnished with a ganglion--govern\r\nsensation only; that the anterior roots are appointed for motion;\r\nand that the primitive fibres of these roots, after being united in\r\na single nervous cord, are mingled together in order to supply the\r\nwants of the skin and muscles. He developed this idea in a little\r\nwork (_An Idea of a new Anatomy of the Brain_, London, 1811), which\r\nwas not intended to travel beyond the circle of his friends.\" Müller\r\ngoes on to say, that eleven years later, Majendie prosecuted the\r\nsame theory. But Mr. Alexander Shaw, in 1839, published _A Narrative\r\nof the Discoveries of Sir Charles Bell in the Nervous System_, in\r\nwhich it appears that Sir Charles Bell had further expounded his\r\nviews in his lectures to his pupils (p. 89), and that one of these,\r\nMr. John Shaw, had in various publications, in 1821 and 1822,\r\nfurther insisted upon the same views; especially in a Memoir _On\r\nPartial Paralysis_ (p. 75). MM. Mayo and Majendie both published\r\nMemoirs in August, 1822; and these and subsequent works confirmed\r\nthe doctrine of Bell. Mr. Alexander Shaw states (p. 97), that a\r\nmistake of Sir Charles Bell's, in an experiment which he had made to\r\nprove his doctrine, was discovered through the joint labors of M.\r\nMajendie and Mr. Mayo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_The Consequent Speculations. Hypotheses respecting\r\nLife, Sensation, and Volition._\r\n\r\nI SHALL not attempt to explain the details of these anatomical\r\ninvestigations; and I shall speak very briefly of the speculations\r\nwhich have been suggested by the obvious subservience of the nerves\r\nto life, sensation, and volition. Some general inferences from their\r\ndistribution were sufficiently obvious; as, that the seat of\r\nsensation and volition is in the brain. Galen begins his work, _On\r\nthe Anatomy of the Nerves_, thus: \"That none of the members of the\r\nanimal either exercises voluntary motion, or receives sensation, and\r\nthat if the nerve be cut, the part immediately becomes inert and\r\ninsensible, is acknowledged by all physicians. But that the origin\r\nof the nerves is partly from the brain, and partly from the spinal\r\nmarrow, I proceed to explain.\" And in his work _On the Doctrines of\r\nPlato and Hippocrates_, he proves at {465} great length[69\\17] that\r\nthe brain is the origin of sensation and motion, refuting the\r\nopinions of earlier days, as that of Chrysippus,[70\\17] who placed\r\nthe _hegemonic_ or master-principle of the soul, in the heart. But\r\nthough Galen thought that the rational soul resides in the brain, he\r\nwas disposed to agree with the poets and philosophers, according to\r\nwhom the heart is the seat of courage and anger, and the liver the\r\nseat of love.[71\\17] The faculties of the soul were by succeeding\r\nphysiologists confined to the brain; but the disposition still\r\nshowed itself, to attribute to them distinct localities. Thus\r\nWillis[72\\17] places the imagination in the _corpus callosum_, the\r\nmemory in the folds of the _hemispheres_, the perception in the\r\n_corpus striatum_. In more recent times, a system founded upon a\r\nsimilar view has been further developed by Gall and his followers.\r\nThe germ of Gall's system may be considered as contained in that of\r\nWillis; for Gall represents the hemispheres as the folds of a great\r\nmembrane which is capable of being unwrapped and spread out, and\r\nplaces the different faculties of man in the different regions of\r\nthis membrane. The chasm which intervenes between matter and motion\r\non the one side, and thought and feeling on the other, is brought\r\ninto view by all such systems; but none of the hypotheses which they\r\ninvolve can effectually bridge it over.\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\17: Lib. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\17: Lib. iii. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\17: Lib. vi. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\17: Cuv. _Sc. Nat._ p. 384.]\r\n\r\nThe same observation may be made respecting the attempts to explain\r\nthe manner in which the nerves operate as the instruments of\r\nsensation and volition. Perhaps a real step was made by\r\nGlisson,[73\\17] professor of medicine in the University of\r\nCambridge, who distinguished in the fibres of the muscles of motion\r\na peculiar property, different from any merely mechanical or\r\nphysical action. His work _On the Nature of the Energetic Substance,\r\nor on the Life of Nature and of its Three First Faculties, The\r\nPerceptive, Appetitive, and Motive_, which was published in 1672, is\r\nrather metaphysical than physiological. But the principles which he\r\nestablishes in this treatise he applies more specially to physiology\r\nin a treatise _On the Stomach and Intestines_ (Amsterdam, 1677). In\r\nthis he ascribes to the fibres of the animal body a peculiar power\r\nwhich he calls _Irritability_. He divides _irritation_ into natural,\r\nvital, and animal; and he points out, though briefly, the gradual\r\ndifferences of irritability in different organs. \"It is hardly\r\ncomprehensible,\" says Sprengel,[74\\17] \"how this {466} lucid and\r\nexcellent notion of the Cambridge teacher was not accepted with\r\ngreater alacrity, and further unfolded by his contemporaries.\" It\r\nhas, however, since been universally adopted.\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\17: Cuv. _Sc. Nat._ p. 434.]\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\17: Spr. iv. 47.]\r\n\r\nBut though the discrimination of muscular irritability as a peculiar\r\npower might be a useful step in physiological research, the\r\nexplanations hitherto offered, of the way in which the nerves\r\noperate on this irritability, and discharge their other offices,\r\npresent only a series of hypotheses. Glisson[75\\17] assumed the\r\nexistence of certain vital spirits, which, according to him, are a\r\nmild, sweet fluid, resembling the spirituous part of white of egg,\r\nand residing in the nerves.--This hypothesis, of a very subtle humor\r\nor spirit existing in the nerves, was indeed very early taken\r\nup.[76\\17] This nervous spirit had been compared to air by\r\nErasistratus, Asclepiades, Galen, and others. The chemical\r\ntendencies of the seventeenth century led to its being described as\r\nacid, sulphureous or nitrous. At the end of that century, the\r\nhypothesis of an _ether_ attracted much notice as a means of\r\naccounting for many phenomena; and this ether was identified with\r\nthe nervous fluid. Newton himself inclines to this view, in the\r\nremarkable Queries which are annexed to his _Opticks_. After\r\nascribing many physical effects to his ether, he adds (Query 23),\r\n\"Is not vision performed chiefly by the vibrations of this medium,\r\nexcited in the bottom of the eye by the rays of light, and\r\npropagated through the solid, pellucid, and uniform capillamenta of\r\nthe nerves into the place of sensation?\" And (Query 24), \"Is not\r\nanimal motion performed by the vibrations of this medium, excited in\r\nthe brain by the power of the will, and propagated from thence\r\nthrough the capillamenta of the nerves into the muscles for\r\ncontracting and dilating them?\" And an opinion approaching this has\r\nbeen adopted by some of the greatest of modern physiologists; as\r\nHaller, who says,[77\\17] that, though it is more easy to find what\r\nthis nervous spirit is not than what it is, he conceives that, while\r\nit must be far too fine to be perceived by the sense, it must yet be\r\nmore gross than fire, magnetism, or electricity; so that it may be\r\ncontained in vessels, and confined by boundaries. And Cuvier speaks\r\nto the same effect:[78\\17] \"There is a great probability that it is\r\nby an imponderable fluid that the nerve acts on the fibre, and that\r\nthis nervous fluid is drawn from the blood, and secreted by the\r\nmedullary matter.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\17: Spr. iv. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\17: Haller, _Physiol._ iv. 365.]\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\17: _Physiol._ iv. 381, lib. x. sect. viii. § 15.]\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\17: _Règne Animal_, Introd. p. 30.]\r\n\r\nWithout presuming to dissent from such authorities on a point of\r\n{467} anatomical probability, we may venture to observe, that these\r\nhypotheses do not tend at all to elucidate the physiological\r\nprinciple which is here involved; for this principle cannot be\r\nmechanical, chemical, or physical, and therefore cannot be better\r\nunderstood by embodying it in a fluid; the difficulty we have in\r\nconceiving what the moving force _is_, is not got rid of by explaining\r\nthe machinery by which it is merely _transferred_. In tracing the\r\nphenomena of sensation and volition to their cause, it is clear that\r\nwe must call in some peculiar and hyperphysical principle. The\r\nhypothesis of a fluid is not made more satisfactory by attenuating\r\nthe fluid; it becomes subtle, spirituous, ethereal, imponderable, to\r\nno purpose; it must cease to be a fluid, before its motions can\r\nbecome sensation and volition. This, indeed, is acknowledged by most\r\nphysiologists; and strongly stated by Cuvier.[79\\17] \"The impression\r\nof external objects upon the ME, the production of a sensation, of\r\nan image, is a mystery impenetrable for our thoughts.\" And in\r\nseveral places, by the use of this peculiar phrase, \"_the me_,\" (_le\r\nmoi_) for the sentient and volent faculty, he marks, with peculiar\r\nappropriateness and force, that phraseology borrowed from the world\r\nof matter will, in this subject, no longer answer our purpose. We\r\nhave here to go from Nouns to Pronouns, from Things to Persons. We\r\npass from the Body to the Soul, from Physics to Metaphysics. We are\r\ncome to the borders of material philosophy; the next step is into\r\nthe domain of Thought and Mind. Here, therefore, we begin to feel\r\nthat we have reached the boundaries of our present subject. The\r\nexamination of that which lies beyond them must be reserved for a\r\nphilosophy of another kind, and for the labors of the future; if we\r\nare ever enabled to make the attempt to extend into that loftier and\r\nwider scene, the principles which we gather on the ground we are now\r\nlaboriously treading.\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\17: _Règne Animal_, Introd. p. 47.]\r\n\r\nSuch speculations as I have quoted respecting the nervous fluid,\r\nproceeding from some of the greatest philosophers who ever lived,\r\nprove only that hitherto the endeavor to comprehend the mystery of\r\nperception and will, of life and thought, have been fruitless and\r\nvain. Many anatomical truths have been discovered, but, so far as\r\nour survey has yet gone, no genuine physiological principle. All the\r\ntrains of physiological research which we have followed have begun\r\nin exact examination of organization and function, and have ended in\r\nwide conjectures and arbitrary hypotheses. The stream of knowledge\r\nin all such cases is {468} clear and lively at its outset; but,\r\ninstead of reaching the great ocean of the general truths of\r\nscience, it is gradually spread abroad among sands and deserts till\r\nits course can be traced no longer.\r\n\r\nHitherto, therefore, we must consider that we have had to tell the\r\nstory of the _failures_ of physiological speculation. But of late\r\nthere have come into view and use among physiologists certain\r\nprinciples which may be considered as peculiar to organized\r\nsubjects; and of which the introduction forms a real advance in\r\norganical science. Though these have hitherto been very imperfectly\r\ndeveloped, we must endeavor to exhibit, in some measure, their\r\nhistory and bearing.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [In order to show that I am not unaware how imperfect the\r\nsketch given in this work is, as a History of Physiology, I may\r\nrefer to the further discussions on these subjects contained in the\r\n_Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, Book ix. I have there (Chap.\r\nii.) noticed the successive _Biological Hypotheses_ of the Mystical,\r\nthe Iatrochemical, and Iatromathematical Schools, the Vital-Fluid\r\nSchool, and the Psychical School. I have (Chaps. iii., iv., v.)\r\nexamined several of the attempts which have been made to analyze the\r\nIdea of Life, to classify Vital Functions, and to form Ideas of\r\nSeparate Vital Forces. I have considered in particular, the attempts\r\nto form a distinct conception of Assimilation and Secretion, of\r\nGeneration, and of Voluntary Motion; and I have (Chap. vi.) further\r\ndiscussed the Idea of Final Causes as employed in Biology.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF DEVELOPED AND METAMORPHOSED\r\nSYMMETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Vegetable Morphology. Göthe. De Candolle._\r\n\r\nBEFORE we proceed to consider the progress of principles which\r\nbelong to animal and human life, such as have just been pointed at,\r\nwe must look round for such doctrines, if any such there be, as\r\napply alike to all organized beings, conscious or unconscious, fixed\r\nor locomotive;--to the laws which regulate vegetable as well as\r\nanimal forms and functions. Though we are very far from being able\r\nto present a {469} clear and connected code of such laws, we may\r\nrefer to one law, at least, which appears to be of genuine authority\r\nand validity; and which is worthy our attention as an example of a\r\nproperly organical or physiological principle, distinct from all\r\nmechanical, chemical, or other physical forces; and such as cannot\r\neven be conceived to be resolvable into those. I speak of the\r\ntendency which produces such results as have been brought together\r\nin recent speculations upon _Morphology_.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be regarded as indicating how peculiar are the\r\nprinciples of organic life, and how far removed from any mere\r\nmechanical action, that the leading idea in these speculations was\r\nfirst strongly and effectively apprehended, not by a laborious\r\nexperimenter and reasoner, but by a man of singularly brilliant and\r\ncreative fancy; not by a mathematician or chemist, but by a poet.\r\nAnd we may add further, that this poet had already shown himself\r\nincapable of rightly apprehending the relation of physical facts to\r\ntheir principles; and had, in trying his powers on such subjects,\r\nexhibited a signal instance of the ineffectual and perverse\r\noperation of the method of philosophizing to which the constitution\r\nof his mind led him. The person of whom we speak, is John Wolfgang\r\nGöthe, who is held, by the unanimous voice of Europe, to have been\r\none of the greatest poets of our own, or of any time, and whose\r\n_Doctrine of Colors_ we have already had to describe, in the History\r\nof Optics, as an entire failure. Yet his views on the laws which\r\nconnect the forms of plants into one simple system, have been\r\ngenerally accepted and followed up. We might almost be led to think\r\nthat this writer's poetical endowments had contributed to this\r\nscientific discovery;--the love of beauty of form, by fixing the\r\nattention upon the symmetry of plants; and the creative habit of\r\nthought, by making constant developement of a familiar\r\nprocess.[80\\17] {470}\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\17: We may quote some of the poet's own verses as an\r\nillustration of his feelings on this subject. They are addressed to\r\na lady.\r\n\r\n  Dich verwirret, geliebte, die tausendfältige mischung\r\n    Dieses blumengewühls über dem garten umher;\r\n  Viele namen hörest du an, und immer verdränget,\r\n    Mit barbarischem klang, einer den andern im ohr.\r\n  Alle gestalten sind **ähnlich und keine gleichet der andern;\r\n    Und so deutet das chor auf ein geheimes gesetz,\r\n  Auf ein heiliges räthsel. O! könnte ich dich, liebliche freundinn,\r\n    Ueberliefern so gleich glücklich das lösende wort.\r\n\r\n  Thou, my love, art perplext with the endless seeming confusion\r\n    Of the luxuriant wealth which in the garden is spread;\r\n  Name upon name thou hearest, and in thy dissatisfied hearing,\r\n    With a barbarian noise one drives another along.\r\n  All the forms resemble, yet none is the same as another;\r\n    Thus the whole of the throng points at a deep hidden law.\r\n  Points at a sacred riddle. Oh! could I to thee, my beloved friend,\r\n    Whisper the fortunate word by which the riddle is read!]\r\n\r\nBut though we cannot but remark the peculiarity of our being\r\nindebted to a poet for the discovery of a scientific principle, we\r\nmust not forget that he himself held, that in making this step, he\r\nhad been guided, not by his invention, but by observation. He\r\nrepelled, with extreme repugnance, the notion that he had\r\nsubstituted fancy for fact, or imposed ideal laws on actual things.\r\nWhile he was earnestly pursuing his morphological speculations, he\r\nattempted to impress them upon Schiller. \"I expounded to him, in as\r\nlively a manner as possible, the metamorphosis of plants, drawing on\r\npaper, with many characteristic strokes, a symbolic plant before his\r\neyes. He heard me,\" Göthe says,[81\\17] \"with much interest and\r\ndistinct comprehension; but when I had done, he shook his head, and\r\nsaid, 'That is not Experience; that is an Idea:' I stopt with some\r\ndegree of irritation; for the point which separated us was marked\r\nmost luminously by this expression.\" And in the same work he relates\r\nhis botanical studies and his habit of observation, from which it is\r\neasily seen that no common amount of knowledge and notice of\r\ndetails, were involved in the course of thought which led him to the\r\nprinciple of the Metamorphosis of Plants.\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\17:_ Zur Morphologie_, p. 24.]\r\n\r\nBefore I state the history of this principle, I may be allowed to\r\nendeavor to communicate to the reader, to whom this subject is new,\r\nsome conception of the principle itself. This will not be difficult,\r\nif he will imagine to himself a flower, for instance, a common\r\nwild-rose, or the blossom of an apple-tree, as consisting of a\r\nseries of parts disposed in _whorls_, placed one over another on an\r\n_axis_. The lowest whorl is the calyx with its five sepals; above\r\nthis is the corolla with its five petals; above this are a multitude\r\nof stamens, which may be considered as separate whorls of five each,\r\noften repeated; above these is a whorl composed of the ovaries, or\r\nwhat become the seed-vessels in the fruit, which are five united\r\ntogether in the apple, but indefinite in number and separate in the\r\nrose. Now the morphological view is {471} this;--that the members of\r\neach of these whorls are in their nature identical, and the same as\r\nif they were whorls of ordinary leaves, brought together by the\r\nshortening their common axis, and modified in form by the successive\r\nelaboration of their nutriment. Further, according to this view, a\r\nwhorl of leaves itself is to be considered as identical with several\r\ndetached leaves dispersed spirally along the axis, and brought\r\ntogether because the axis is shortened. Thus all the parts of a\r\nplant are, or at least represent, the successive metamorphoses of\r\nthe same elementary member. The root-leaves thus pass into the\r\ncommon leaves;--these into bracteæ;--these into the sepals;--these\r\ninto the petals;--these into the stamens with their anthers;--these\r\ninto the ovaries with their styles and stigmas;--these ultimately\r\nbecome the fruit; and thus we are finally led to the seed of a new\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nMoreover the same notion of metamorphosis may be applied to explain\r\nthe existence of flowers which are not symmetrical like those we\r\nhave just referred to, but which have an irregular corolla or calyx.\r\nThe papilionaceous flower of the pea tribe, which is so markedly\r\nirregular, may be deduced by easy gradations from the regular\r\nflower, (through the _mimoseæ_,) by expanding one petal, joining one\r\nor two others, and modifying the form of the intermediate ones.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to go into detail respecting the proofs of that\r\nidentity of all the different organs, and all the different forms of\r\nplants, which is thus asserted, we may observe, that it rests on\r\nsuch grounds as these;--the transformations which the parts of\r\nflowers undergo by accidents of nutriment or exposure. Such changes,\r\nconsidered as monstrosities where they are very remarkable, show the\r\ntendencies and possibilities belonging to the organization in which\r\nthey occur. For instance, the single wild-rose, by culture,\r\ntransforms many of its numerous stamens into petals, and thus\r\nacquires the deeply folded flower of the double garden-rose. We\r\ncannot doubt of the reality of this change, for we often see stamens\r\nin which it is incomplete. In other cases we find petals becoming\r\nleaves, and a branch growing out of the centre of the flower. Some\r\npear-trees, when in blossom, are remarkable for their tendencies to\r\nsuch monstrosities.[82\\17] Again, we find that flowers which are\r\nusually irregular, occasionally become regular, and conversely. The\r\ncommon snap-dragon (_Linaria vulgaris_) affords a curious instance\r\nof this.[83\\17] The usual form of this plant is \"personate,\" the\r\ncorolla being divided into two lobes, which differ in form, and\r\n{472} together present somewhat the appearance of an animal's face;\r\nand the upper portion of the corolla is prolonged backwards into a\r\ntube-like \"spur.\" No flower can be more irregular; but there is a\r\nsingular variety of this plants termed _Peloria_, in which the\r\ncorolla is strictly symmetrical, consisting of a conical tube,\r\nnarrowed in front, elongated behind into five equal spurs, and\r\ncontaining five stamens of equal length, instead of the two unequal\r\npairs of the didynamous Linaria. These and the like appearances show\r\nthat there is in nature a capacity for, and tendency to, such\r\nchanges as the doctrine of metamorphosis asserts.\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\17: Lindley, _Nat. Syst._ p. 84.]\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\17: Henslow, _Principles of Botany_, p. 116.]\r\n\r\nGöthe's _Metamorphosis of Plants_ was published 1790: and his system\r\nwas the result of his own independent course of thoughts. The view\r\nwhich it involved was not, however, absolutely new, though it had\r\nnever before been unfolded in so distinct and persuasive a manner.\r\nLinnæus considered the leaves, calyx, corolla, stamens, each as\r\nevolved in succession from the other; and spoke of it as _prolepsis_\r\nor _anticipation_,[84\\17] when the leaves changed accidentally into\r\nbracteæ, these into a calyx, this into a corolla, the corolla into\r\nstamens, or these into the pistil. And Caspar Wolf apprehended in a\r\nmore general manner the same principle. \"In the whole plant,\" says\r\nhe,[85\\17] \"we see nothing but leaves and stalk;\" and in order to\r\nprove what is the situation of the leaves in all their later forms,\r\nhe adduces the cotyledons as the first leaves.\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\17: Sprengel, _Bot._ ii. 302. _Amœn. Acad._ vi. 324, 365.]\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\17: _Nov. Con. Ac. Petrop._ xii. 403, xiii. 478.]\r\n\r\nGöthe was led to his system on this subject by his general views of\r\nnature. He saw, he says,[86\\17] that a whole life of talent and\r\nlabor was requisite to enable any one to arrange the infinitely\r\ncopious organic forms of a single kingdom of nature. \"Yet I felt,\"\r\nhe adds, \"that for me there must be another way, analogous to the\r\nrest of my habits. The appearance of the changes, round and round,\r\nof organic creatures had taken strong hold on my mind. Imagination\r\nand Nature appeared to me to vie with each other which could go on\r\nmost boldly yet most consistently.\" His observation of nature,\r\ndirected by such a thought, led him to the doctrine of the\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\17: _Zur Morph._ i. 30.]\r\n\r\nIn a later republication of his work (_Zur Morphologie_, 1817,) he\r\ngives a very agreeable account of the various circumstances which\r\naffected the reception and progress of his doctrine.\r\nWilldenow[87\\17] quoted {473} him thus:--\"The life of plants is, as\r\nMr. Göthe very prettily says, an expansion and contraction, and\r\nthese alternations make the various periods of life.\" \"This\r\n'_prettily_,'\" says Göthe, \"I can be well content with, but the\r\n'_egregie_,' of Usteri is much more pretty and obliging.\" Usteri had\r\nused this term respecting Göthe in an edition of Jussieu.\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\17: _Zur Morph._ i. 121.]\r\n\r\nThe application of the notion of metamorphosis to the explanation of\r\ndouble and monstrous flowers had been made previously by Jussieu.\r\nGöthe's merit was, to have referred to it the _regular_ formation of\r\nthe flower. And as Sprengel justly says,[88\\17] his view had so\r\nprofound a meaning, made so strong an appeal by its simplicity, and\r\nwas so fruitful in the most valuable consequences, that it was not\r\nto be wondered at if it occasioned further examination of the\r\nsubject; although many persons pretend to slight it. The task of\r\nconfirming and verifying the doctrine by a general application of it\r\nto all cases,--a labor so important and necessary after the\r\npromulgation of any great principle,--Göthe himself did not execute.\r\nAt first he collected specimens and made drawings with some such\r\nview,[89\\17] but he was interrupted and diverted to other matters.\r\n\"And now,\" says he, in his later publication, \"when I look back on\r\nthis undertaking, it is easy to see that the object which I had\r\nbefore my eyes was, for me, in my position, with my habits and mode\r\nof thinking, unattainable. For it was no less than this: that I was\r\nto take that which I had stated in general, and presented to the\r\nconception, to the mental intuition, in words; and that I should, in\r\na particularly visible, orderly, and gradual manner, present it to\r\nthe eye; so as to show to the outward sense that out of the germ of\r\nthis idea might grow a tree of physiology fit to overshadow the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\17: _Gesch. Botan._ ii. 304.]\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\17: _Zur Morph._ i. **129.]\r\n\r\nVoigt, professor at Jena, was one of the first who adopted Göthe's\r\nview into an elementary work, which he did in 1808. Other botanists\r\nlabored in the direction which had thus been pointed out. Of those\r\nwho have thus contributed to the establishment and developement of\r\nthe metamorphic doctrine. Professor De Candolle, of Geneva, is\r\nperhaps the most important. His Theory of Developement rests upon\r\ntwo main principles, _abortion_ and _adhesion_. By considering some\r\nparts as degenerated or absent through the abortion of the buds\r\nwhich might have formed them, and other parts as adhering together,\r\nhe holds that all plants may be reduced to perfect symmetry: and the\r\nactual and constant occurrence of such incidents is shown beyond\r\n{474} all doubt. And thus the snap-dragon, of which we have spoken\r\nabove, is derived from the Peloria, which is the normal condition of\r\nthe flower, by the abortion of one stamen, and the degeneration of\r\ntwo others. Such examples are too numerous to need to be dwelt on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Application of Vegetable Morphology._\r\n\r\nTHE doctrine, being thus fully established, has been applied to\r\nsolve different problems in botany; for instance, to explain the\r\nstructure of flowers which appear at first sight to deviate widely\r\nfrom the usual forms of the vegetable world. We have an instance of\r\nsuch an application in Mr. Robert Brown's explanation of the real\r\nstructure of various plants which had been entirely misunderstood:\r\nas, for example, the genus _Euphorbia_. In this plant he showed that\r\nwhat had been held to be a jointed filament, was a pedicel with a\r\nfilament above it, the intermediate corolla having evanesced. In\r\n_Orchideæ_ (the orchis tribe), he showed that the peculiar structure\r\nof the plant arose from its having six stamens (two sets of three\r\neach), of which five are usually abortive. In _Coniferæ_ (the\r\ncone-bearing trees), it was made to appear that the seed was naked,\r\nwhile the accompanying appendage, corresponding to a seed-vessel,\r\nassumed all forms, from a complete leaf to a mere scale. In like\r\nmanner it was proved that the _pappus_, or down of _composite_\r\nplants (as thistles), is a transformed calyx.\r\n\r\nAlong with this successful application of a profound principle, it\r\nwas natural that other botanists should make similar attempts. Thus\r\nMr. Lindley was led to take a view[90\\17] of the structure of\r\n_Reseda_ (mignonette) different from that usually entertained;\r\nwhich, when published, attracted a good deal of attention, and\r\ngained some converts among the botanists of Germany and France. But\r\nin 1833, Mr. Lindley says, with great candor, \"Lately, Professor\r\nHenslow has satisfactorily proved, in part by the aid of a\r\nmonstrosity in the common _Mignonette_, in part by a severe\r\napplication of morphological rules, that my hypothesis must\r\nnecessarily be false.\" Such an agreement of different botanists\r\nrespecting the consequences of morphological rules, proves the\r\nreality and universality of the rules.\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\17: Lindley, _Brit. Assoc. Report_, iii. 50.]\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, that a principle which we may call the\r\n_Principle of Developed and Metamorphosed Symmetry_, is firmly\r\nestablished {475} and recognized, and familiarly and successfully\r\napplied by botanists. And it will be apparent, on reflection, that\r\nthough _symmetry_ is a notion which applies to inorganic as well as\r\nto organic things, and is, in fact, a conception of certain\r\nrelations of space and position, such _developement_ and\r\n_metamorphosis_ as are here spoken of, are ideas entirely different\r\nfrom any of those to which the physical sciences have led us in our\r\nprevious survey; and are, in short, genuine _organical_ or\r\n_physiological_ ideas;--real elements of the philosophy of _life_.\r\n\r\nWe must, however imperfectly, endeavor to trace the application of\r\nthis idea in the other great department of the world of life; we\r\nmust follow the history of Animal Morphology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF ANIMAL MORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Rise of Comparative Anatomy._\r\n\r\nTHE most general and constant relations of the form of the organs,\r\nboth in plants and animals, are the most natural grounds of\r\nclassification. Hence the first scientific classifications of\r\nanimals are the first steps in animal morphology. At first, a\r\n_zoology_ was constructed by arranging animals, as plants were at\r\nfirst arranged, according to their external parts. But in the course\r\nof the researches of the anatomists of the seventeenth century, it\r\nwas seen that the internal structure of animals offered resemblances\r\nand transitions of a far more coherent and philosophical kind, and\r\nthe Science of _Comparative Anatomy_ rose into favor and importance.\r\nAmong the main cultivators of this science[91\\17] at the period just\r\nmentioned, we find Francis Redi, of Arezzo; Guichard-Joseph\r\nDuvernay, who was for sixty years Professor of Anatomy at the Jardin\r\ndu Roi at Paris, and during this lapse of time had for his pupils\r\nalmost all the greatest anatomists of the greater part of the\r\neighteenth century; Nehemiah Grew, secretary to the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, whose _Anatomy of Plants_ we have already noticed.\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\17: Cuv. _Leçons sur l'Hist. des Sc. Nat._ 414, 420.]\r\n\r\nBut Comparative Anatomy, which had been cultivated with ardor {476}\r\nto the end of the seventeenth century, was, in some measure,\r\nneglected during the first two-thirds of the eighteenth. The\r\nprogress of botany was, Cuvier sagaciously suggests,[92\\17] one\r\ncause of this; for that science had made its advances by confining\r\nitself to external characters, and rejecting anatomy; and though\r\nLinnæus acknowledged the dependence of zoology upon anatomy[93\\17]\r\nso far as to make the number of teeth his characters, even this was\r\nfelt, in his method, as a bold step. But his influence was soon\r\nopposed by that of Buffon, Daubenton, and Pallas; who again brought\r\ninto view the importance of comparative anatomy in Zoology; at the\r\nsame time that Haller proved how much might be learnt from it in\r\nPhysiology. John Hunter in England, the two Monros in Scotland,\r\nCamper in Holland, and Vicq d'Azyr in France, were the first to\r\nfollow the path thus pointed out. Camper threw the glance of genius\r\non a host of interesting objects, but almost all that he produced\r\nwas a number of sketches; Vicq d'Azyr, more assiduous, was stopt in\r\nthe midst of a most brilliant career by a premature death.\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\17: Cuv. _Hist. Sc. Nat._ i. 301.]\r\n\r\n[Note 93\\17: Ib.]\r\n\r\nSuch is Cuvier's outline of the earlier history of comparative\r\nanatomy. We shall not go into detail upon this subject; but we may\r\nobserve that such studies had fixed in the minds of naturalists the\r\nconviction of the possibility and the propriety of considering large\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom as modifications of one common\r\n_type_. Belon, as early as 1555, had placed the skeleton of a man\r\nand a bird side by side, and shown the correspondence of parts. So\r\nfar as the case of vertebrated animals extends, this correspondence\r\nis generally allowed; although it required some ingenuity to detect\r\nits details in some cases; for instance, to see the analogy of parts\r\nbetween the head of a man and a fish.\r\n\r\nIn tracing these less obvious correspondencies, some curious steps\r\nhave been made in recent times. And here we must, I conceive, again\r\nascribe no small merit to the same remarkable man who, as we have\r\nalready had to point out, gave so great an impulse to vegetable\r\nmorphology. Göthe, whose talent and disposition for speculating on\r\nall parts of nature were truly admirable, was excited to the study\r\nof anatomy by his propinquity to the Duke of Weimar's cabinet of\r\nnatural history. In 1786, he published a little essay, the object of\r\nwhich was to show that in man, as well as in beasts, the upper jaw\r\ncontains an intermaxillary bone, although the sutures are\r\nobliterated. After 1790,[94\\17] animated and impelled by the same\r\npassion for natural {477} observation and for general views, which\r\nhad produced his Metamorphosis of Plants, he pursued his\r\nspeculations on these subjects eagerly and successfully. And in\r\n1795, he published a _Sketch of a Universal Introduction into\r\nComparative Anatomy, beginning with Osteology_; in which he attempts\r\nto establish an \"osteological type,\" to which skeletons of all\r\nanimals may be referred. I do not pretend that Göthe's anatomical\r\nworks have had any influence on the progress of the science\r\ncomparable with that which has been exercised by the labors of\r\nprofessional anatomists; but the ingenuity and value of the views\r\nwhich they contained was acknowledged by the best authorities; and\r\nthe clearer introduction and application of the principle of\r\ndeveloped and metamorphosed symmetry may be dated from about this\r\ntime. Göthe declares that, at an early period of these speculations,\r\nhe was convinced[95\\17] that the bony head of beasts is to be\r\nderived from six vertebræ. In 1807, Oken published a \"Program\" _On\r\nthe Signification of the Bones of the Skull_, in which he maintained\r\nthat these bones are equivalent to four vertebræ); and Meckel, in\r\nhis _Comparative Anatomy_, in 1811, also resolved the skull into\r\nvertebræ. But Spix, in his elaborate work _Cephalogenesis_, in 1815,\r\nreduced the vertebræ of the head to three. \"Oken,\" he says,[96\\17]\r\n\"published opinions merely theoretical, and consequently contrary to\r\nthose maintained in this work, which are drawn from observation.\"\r\nThis resolution of the head into vertebræ is assented to by many of\r\nthe best physiologists, as explaining the distribution of the\r\nnerves, and other phenomena. Spix further extended the application\r\nof the vertebral theory to the heads of all classes of vertebrate\r\nanimals; and Bojanus published a Memoir expressly on the vertebral\r\nstructure of the skulls of fishes in Oken's _Isis_ for 1818.\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire presented a lithographic plate to the French\r\nAcademy in February 1824, entitled _Composition de la Tête **osseuse\r\nchez l'Homme et les Animaux_, and developed his views of the\r\nvertebral composition of the skull in two Memoirs published in the\r\n_Annales des Sciences Naturelles_ for 1824. We cannot fail to\r\nrecognize here the attempt to apply to the skeleton of animals the\r\nprinciple which leads botanists to consider all the parts of a\r\nflower as transformations of the same organs. How far the\r\napplication of the principle, as here proposed, is just, I must\r\nleave philosophical physiologists to decide.\r\n\r\n[Note 94\\17: _Zur Morphologie_, i. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\17: _Zur Morphologie_, 250.]\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\17:  Spix, _Cephalogenesis_.]\r\n\r\nBy these and similar researches, it is held by the best\r\nphysiologists {478} that the skull of all vertebrate animals is\r\npretty well reduced to a uniform structure, and the laws of its\r\nvariations nearly determined.[97\\17]\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\17: Cuv. _Hist. Sc. Nat._ iii. 442.]\r\n\r\nThe vertebrate animals being thus reduced to a single type, the\r\nquestion arises how far this can be done with regard to other\r\nanimals, and how many such types there are. And here we come to one\r\nof the important services which Cuvier rendered to natural history.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Distinction of the General Types of the Forms of\r\nAnimals.--Cuvier._\r\n\r\nANIMALS were divided by Lamarck into vertebrate and invertebrate;\r\nand the general analogies of all vertebrate animals are easily made\r\nmanifest. But with regard to other animals, the point is far from\r\nclear. Cuvier was the first to give a really philosophical view of\r\nthe animal world in reference to the plan on which each animal is\r\nconstructed. There are,[98\\17] he says, four such plans;--four forms\r\non which animals appear to have been modelled; and of which the\r\nulterior divisions, with whatever titles naturalists have decorated\r\nthem, are only very slight modifications, founded on the development\r\nor addition of some parts which do not produce any essential change\r\nin the plan.\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\17: _Règne Animal_, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nThese four great branches of the animal world are the _vertebrata_,\r\n_mollusca_, _articulata_, _radiata_; and the differences of these\r\nare so important that a slight explanation of them may be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe _vertebrata_ are those animals which (as man and other sucklers,\r\nbirds, fishes, lizards, frogs, serpents) have a backbone and a skull\r\nwith lateral appendages, within which the viscera are included, and\r\nto which the muscles are attached.\r\n\r\nThe _mollusca_, or soft animals, have no bony skeleton; the muscles\r\nare attached to the skin, which often includes stony plates called\r\n_shells_; such molluscs are shell-fish; others are cuttle-fish, and\r\nmany pulpy sea-animals.\r\n\r\nThe _articulata_ consist of _crustacea_ (lobsters, &c.), _insects_,\r\n_spiders_, and _annulose worms_, which consist of a head and a\r\nnumber of successive annular portions of the body _jointed_ together\r\n(to the interior of which the muscles are attached), whence the name.\r\n\r\nFinally, the _radiata_ include the animals known under the name of\r\n_zoophytes_. In the preceding three branches the organs of motion\r\nand of sense were distributed symmetrically on the two sides of an\r\naxis, {479} so that the animal has a right and a left side. In the\r\nradiata the similar members radiate from the axis in a circular\r\nmanner, like the petals of a regular flower.\r\n\r\nThe whole value of such a classification cannot be understood\r\nwithout explaining its use in enabling us to give general\r\ndescriptions, and general laws of the animal functions of the\r\nclasses which it includes; but in the present part of our work our\r\nbusiness is to exhibit it as an exemplification of the reduction of\r\nanimals to laws of Symmetry. The bipartite Symmetry of the form of\r\nvertebrate and articulate animals is obvious; and the reduction of\r\nthe various forms of such animals to a common type has been\r\neffected, by attention to their anatomy, in a manner which has\r\nsatisfied those who have best studied the subject. The molluscs,\r\nespecially those in which the head disappears, as oysters, or those\r\nwhich are rolled into a spiral, as snails, have a less obvious\r\nSymmetry, but here also we can apply certain general types. And the\r\nSymmetry of the radiated zoophytes is of a nature quite different\r\nfrom all the rest, and approaching, as we have suggested, to the\r\nkind of Symmetry found in plants. Some naturalists have doubted\r\nwhether[99\\17] these zoophytes are not referrible to two types\r\n(_acrita_ or polypes, and true _radiata_,) rather than to one.\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\17: _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ iv. 227.]\r\n\r\nThis fourfold division was introduced by Cuvier.[100\\17] Before him,\r\nnaturalists followed Linnæus, and divided non-vertebrate animals\r\ninto two classes, insects and worms. \"I began,\" says Cuvier, \"to\r\nattack this view of the subject, and offered another division, in a\r\nMemoir read at the Society of Natural History of Paris, the 21st of\r\nFloreal, in the year III. of the Republic (May 10, 1795,) printed in\r\nthe _Décade Philosophique_: in this, I mark the characters and the\r\nlimits of molluscs, insects, worms, echinoderms, and zoophytes. I\r\ndistinguish the red-blooded worms or annelides, in a Memoir read to\r\nthe Institute, the 11th Nivose, year X. (December 31, 1801.) I\r\nafterwards distributed these different classes into three branches,\r\neach co-ordinate to the branch formed by the vertebrate animals, in\r\na Memoir read to the Institute in July, 1812, printed in the\r\n_Annales du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle_, tom. xix.\" His great\r\nsystematic work, the _Règne Animal_, founded on this distribution,\r\nwas published in 1817; and since that time the division has been\r\ncommonly accepted among naturalists.\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\17: _Règne A._ 61.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The question of the Classification of Animals is\r\ndiscussed in the first of Prof. Owen's _Lectures on the\r\nInvertebrate_ {480} _Animals_ (1843). Mr. Owen observes that the\r\narrangement of animals into _Vertebrate_ and _Invertebrate_ which\r\nprevailed before Cuvier, was necessarily bad, inasmuch as no\r\n_negative_ character in Zoology gives true natural groups. Hence the\r\nestablishment of the _sub-kingdoms_, _Mollusca_, _Articulata_,\r\n_Radiata_, as co-ordinate with _Vertebrata_, according to the\r\narrangement of the nervous system, was a most important advance. But\r\nMr. Owen has seen reason to separate the _Radiata_ of Cuvier into\r\ntwo divisions; the _Nematoneura_, in which the nervous system can be\r\ntraced in a filamentary form (including _Echinoderma_,\r\n_Ciliobrachiata_, _Cœlelmintha_, _Rotifera_,) and the _Acrita_ or\r\nlowest division of the animal kingdom, including _Acalepha_,\r\n_Nudibrachiata_, _Sterelmintha_, _Polygastria_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Attempts to establish the Identity of the Types of\r\nAnimal Forms._\r\n\r\nSUPPOSING this great step in Zoology, of which we have given an\r\naccount,--the reduction of all animals to four types or plans,--to\r\nbe quite secure, we are then led to ask whether any further advance\r\nis possible;--whether several of these types can be referred to one\r\ncommon form by any wider effort of generalization. On this question\r\nthere has been a considerable difference of opinion. Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire,[101\\17] who had previously endeavored to show that\r\nall vertebrate animals were constructed so exactly upon the same\r\nplan as to preserve the strictest analogy of parts in respect to\r\ntheir osteology, thought to extend this unity of plan by\r\ndemonstrating, that the hard parts of crustaceans and insects are\r\nstill only modifications of the skeleton of higher animals, and that\r\ntherefore the type of vertebrata must be made to include them\r\nalso:--the segments of the articulata are held to be strictly\r\nanalogous to the vertebras of the higher animals, and thus the\r\nformer live _within_ their vertebral column in the same manner as\r\nthe latter live _without_ it. Attempts have even been made to reduce\r\nmolluscous and vertebrate animals to a community of type, as we\r\nshall see shortly.\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\17: Mr. Jenyns, _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ iv. 150.]\r\n\r\nAnother application of the principle, according to which creatures\r\nthe most different are developments of the same original type, may\r\nbe discerned[102\\17] in the doctrine, that the embryo of the higher\r\nforms of animal life passes by gradations through those forms which\r\nare {481} permanent in inferior animals. Thus, according to this\r\nview, the human fœtus assumes successively the plan of the zoophyte,\r\nthe worm, the fish, the turtle, the bird, the beast. But it has been\r\nwell observed, that \"in these analogies we look in vain for the\r\nprecision which can alone support the inference that has been\r\ndeduced;\"[103\\17] and that at each step, the higher embryo and the\r\nlower animal which it is supposed to resemble, differ in having each\r\ndifferent organs suited to their respective destinations.\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\17: Dr. Clark, _Report_, Ib. iv. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\17: Dr. Clark, p. 114.]\r\n\r\nCuvier[104\\17] never assented to this view, nor to the attempts to\r\nrefer the different divisions of his system to a common type. \"He\r\ncould not admit,\" says his biographer, \"that the lungs or gills of\r\nthe vertebrates are in the same connexion as the branchiæ of\r\nmolluscs and crustaceans, which in the one are situated at the base\r\nof the feet, or fixed on the feet themselves, and in the other often\r\non the back or about the arms. He did not admit the analogy between\r\nthe skeleton of the vertebrates and the skin of the articulates; he\r\ncould not believe that the tænia and the sepia were constructed on\r\nthe same plan; that there was a similarity of composition between\r\nthe bird and the echinus, the whale and the snail; in spite of the\r\nskill with which some persons sought gradually to efface their\r\ndiscrepancies.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\17: Laurillard, _Elog. de Cuvier_, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nWhether it may be possible to establish, among the four great\r\ndivisions of the \"Animal Kingdom,\" some analogies of a higher order\r\nthan those which prevail within each division, I do not pretend to\r\nconjecture. If this can be done, it is clear that it must be by\r\ncomparing the types of these divisions under their most general\r\nforms: and thus Cuvier's arrangement, so far as it is itself rightly\r\nfounded on the unity of composition of each branch, is the surest\r\nstep to the discovery of a unity pervading and uniting these\r\nbranches. But those who generalize surely, and those who generalize\r\nrapidly, may travel in the same direction, they soon separate so\r\nwidely, that they appear to move from each other. The partisans of a\r\nuniversal \"unity of composition\" of animals, accused Cuvier of being\r\ntoo inert in following the progress of physiological and zoological\r\nscience. Borrowing their illustration from the political parties of\r\nthe times, they asserted that he belonged to the science of\r\n_resistance_, not to the science of the _movement_. Such a charge\r\nwas highly honorable to him; for no one acquainted with the history\r\nof zoology can doubt that he had a great share in the impulse by\r\nwhich the \"movement\" was occasioned; or that he {482} himself made a\r\nlarge advance with it; and it was because he was so poised by the\r\nvast mass of his knowledge, so temperate in his love of doubtful\r\ngeneralizations, that he was not swept on in the wilder part of the\r\nstream. To such a charge, moderate reformers, who appreciate the\r\nvalue of the good which exists, though they try to make it better,\r\nand who know the knowledge, thoughtfulness, and caution, which are\r\nneedful in such a task, are naturally exposed. For us, who can only\r\ndecide on such a subject by the general analogies of the history of\r\nscience, it may suffice to say, that it appears doubtful whether the\r\nfundamental conceptions of affinity, analogy, transition, and\r\ndevelopement, have yet been fixed in the minds of physiologists with\r\nsufficient firmness and clearness, or unfolded with sufficient\r\nconsistency and generality, to make it likely that any great\r\nadditional step of this kind can for some time be made.\r\n\r\nWe have here considered the doctrine of the identity of the\r\nseemingly various types of animal structure, as an attempt to extend\r\nthe correspondencies which were the basis of Cuvier's division of\r\nthe animal kingdom. But this doctrine has been put forward in\r\nanother point of view, as the antithesis to the doctrine of final\r\ncauses. This question is so important a one, that we cannot help\r\nattempting to give some view of its state and bearings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTRINE OF FINAL CAUSES IN PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Assertion of the Principle of Unity of Plan._\r\n\r\nWE have repeatedly seen, in the course of our historical view of\r\nPhysiology, that those who have studied the structure of animals and\r\nplants, have had a conviction forced upon them, that the organs are\r\nconstructed and combined in subservience to the life and functions\r\nof the whole. The parts have a _purpose_, as well as a _law_;--we\r\ncan trace Final Causes, as well as Laws of Causation. This principle\r\nis peculiar to physiology; and it might naturally be expected that,\r\nin the progress of the science, it would come under special\r\nconsideration. This accordingly has happened; and the principle has\r\nbeen drawn {483} into a prominent position by the struggle of two\r\nantagonistic schools of physiologists. On the one hand, it has been\r\nmaintained that this doctrine of final causes is altogether\r\nunphilosophical, and requires to be replaced by a more comprehensive\r\nand profound principle: on the other hand, it is asserted that the\r\ndoctrine is not only true, but that, in our own time, it has been\r\nfixed and developed so as to become the instrument of some of the\r\nmost important discoveries which have been made. Of the views of\r\nthese two schools we must endeavor to give some account.\r\n\r\nThe disciples of the former of the two schools express their tenets\r\nby the phrases _unity_ of _plan_, _unity_ of _composition_; and the\r\nmore detailed developement of these doctrines has been termed the\r\n_Theory of Analogies_, by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, who claims this\r\ntheory as his own creation. According to this theory, the structure\r\nand functions of animals are to be studied by the guidance of their\r\nanalogy only; our attention is to be turned, not to the fitness of\r\nthe organization for any end of life or action, but to its\r\nresemblance to other organizations by which it is gradually derived\r\nfrom the original type.\r\n\r\nAccording to the rival view of this subject, we must not assume, and\r\ncannot establish, that the plan of all animals is the same, or their\r\ncomposition similar. The existence of a single and universal system\r\nof analogies in the construction of all animals is entirely\r\nunproved, and therefore cannot be made our guide in the study of\r\ntheir properties. On the other hand, the plan of the animal, the\r\npurpose of its organization in the support of its life, the\r\nnecessity of the functions to its existence, are truths which are\r\nirresistibly apparent, and which may therefore be safely taken as\r\nthe bases of our reasonings. This view has been put forward as the\r\ndoctrine of the _conditions of existence_: it may also be described\r\nas the principle of _a purpose in organization_; the structure being\r\nconsidered as having the function for its end. We must say a few\r\nwords on each of these views.\r\n\r\nIt had been pointed out by Cuvier, as we have seen in the last\r\nchapter, that the animal kingdom may be divided into four great\r\nbranches; in each of which the _plan_ of the animal is different,\r\nnamely, _vertebrata_, _articulata_, _mollusca_, _radiata_. Now the\r\nquestion naturally occurs, is there really no resemblance of\r\nconstruction in these different classes? It was maintained by some,\r\nthat there is such a resemblance. In 1820,[105\\17] M. Audouin, a\r\nyoung naturalist of Paris, {484} endeavored to fill up the chasm\r\nwhich separates insects from other animals; and by examining\r\ncarefully the portions which compose the solid frame-work of\r\ninsects, and following them through their various transformations in\r\ndifferent classes, he conceived that he found relations of position\r\nand function, and often of number and form, which might be compared\r\nwith the relations of the parts of the skeleton in vertebrate\r\nanimals. He thought that the first segment of an insect, the\r\nhead,[106\\17] represents one of the three vertebræ which, according\r\nto Spix and others, compose the vertebrate head: the second segment\r\nof the insects, (the _prothorax_ of Audouin,) is, according to M.\r\nGeoffroy, the second vertebra of the head of the vertebrata, and so\r\non. Upon this speculation Cuvier[107\\17] does not give any decided\r\nopinion; observing only, that even if false, it leads to active\r\nthought and useful research.\r\n\r\n[Note 105\\17: Cuv. _Hist. Sc. Nat._ iii. 422.]\r\n\r\n[Note 106\\17: Ib. 437.]\r\n\r\n[Note 107\\17: Cuv. _Hist. Sc. Nat._ iii. 441.]\r\n\r\nBut when an attempt was further made to identify the plan of another\r\nbranch of the animal world, the mollusca, with that of the\r\nvertebrata, the radical opposition between such views and those of\r\nCuvier, broke out into an animated controversy.\r\n\r\nTwo French anatomists, MM. Laurencet and Meyranx, presented to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, in 1830, a Memoir containing their views on the\r\norganization of molluscous animals; and on the sepia or cuttle-fish\r\nin particular, as one of the most complete examples of such animals.\r\nThese creatures, indeed, though thus placed in the same division\r\nwith shell-fish of the most defective organization and obscure\r\nstructure, are far from being scantily organized. They have a\r\nbrain,[108\\17] often eyes, and these, in the animals of this class,\r\n(_cephalopoda_) are more complicated than in any\r\nvertebrates;[109\\17] they have sometimes ears, salivary glands,\r\nmultiple stomachs, a considerable liver, a bile, a complete double\r\ncirculation, provided with auricles and ventricles; in short, their\r\nvital activity is vigorous, and their senses are distinct.\r\n\r\n[Note 108\\17: Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire denies this. _Principes de\r\nPhil. Zoologique discutés en_ 1830, p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Note 109\\17: Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, _Principes de Phil. Zoologique\r\ndiscutés en_ 1830, p. 55.]\r\n\r\nBut still, though this organization, in the abundance and diversity\r\nof its parts, approaches that of vertebrate animals, it had not been\r\nconsidered as composed in the same manner, or arranged in the same\r\norder, Cuvier had always maintained that the plan of molluscs is not\r\na continuation of the plan of vertebrates. {485}\r\n\r\nMM. Laurencet and Meyranx, on the contrary, conceived that the sepia\r\nmight be reduced to the type of a vertebrate creature, by\r\nconsidering the back-bone of the latter bent double backwards, so as\r\nto bring the root of the tail to the nape of the neck; the parts\r\nthus brought into contact being supposed to coalesce. By this mode\r\nof conception, these anatomists held that the viscera were placed in\r\nthe same connexion as in the vertebrate type, and the functions\r\nexercised in an analogous manner.\r\n\r\nTo decide on the reality of the analogy thus asserted, clearly\r\nbelonged to the jurisdiction of the most eminent anatomists and\r\nphysiologists. The Memoir was committed to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\r\nand Latreille, two eminent zoologists, in order to be reported on.\r\nTheir report was extremely favorable; and went almost to the length\r\nof adopting the views of the authors.\r\n\r\nCuvier expressed some dissatisfaction with this report on its being\r\nread;[110\\17] and a short time afterwards,[111\\17] represented\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire as having asserted that the new views of\r\nLaurencet and Meyranx refuted completely the notion of the great\r\ninterval which exists between molluscous and vertebrate animals.\r\nGeoffroy protested against such an interpretation of his\r\nexpressions; but it soon appeared, by the controversial character\r\nwhich the discussions on this and several other subjects assumed,\r\nthat a real opposition of opinions was in action.\r\n\r\n[Note 110\\17: _Princ. de Phil. Zool. discutés en_ 1830, p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Note 111\\17: p. 50.]\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to explain the exact views of Geoffroy, (we may,\r\nperhaps, venture to say that they are hardly yet generally\r\nunderstood with sufficient distinctness to justify the mere\r\nhistorian of science in attempting such an explanation,) their\r\ngeneral tendency may be sufficiently collected from what has been\r\nsaid; and from the phrases in which his views are conveyed.[112\\17]\r\n_The principle of connexions, the elective affinities of organic\r\nelements, the equilibrization of organs_;--such are the designations\r\nof the leading doctrines which are unfolded in the preliminary\r\ndiscourse of his _Anatomical Philosophy_. Elective affinities of\r\norganic elements are the forces by which the vital structures and\r\nvaried forms of living things are produced; and the principles of\r\nconnexion and equilibrium of these forces in the various parts of\r\nthe organization prescribe limits and conditions to the variety and\r\ndevelopement of such forms.\r\n\r\n[Note 112\\17: _Phil. Zool._ 15.]\r\n\r\nThe character and tendency of this philosophy will be, I think,\r\n{486} much more clear, if we consider what it excludes and denies.\r\nIt rejects altogether all conception of a plan and purpose in the\r\norgans of animals, as a principle which has determined their forms,\r\nor can be of use in directing our reasonings. \"I take care,\" says\r\nGeoffroy, \"not to ascribe to God any intention.\"[113\\17] And when\r\nCuvier speaks of the combination of organs in such order that they\r\nmay be in consistence with the part which the animal _has to play_\r\nin nature; his rival rejoins,[114\\17] I \"know nothing of animals\r\nwhich _have to play_ a part in nature.\" Such a notion is, he holds,\r\nunphilosophical and dangerous. It is an abuse of final causes which\r\nmakes the cause to be engendered by the effect. And to illustrate\r\nstill further his own view, he says, \"I have read concerning\r\nfishes, that because they live in a medium which resists more than\r\nair, their motive forces are calculated so as to give them the power\r\nof progression under those circumstances. By this mode of reasoning,\r\nyou would say of a man who makes use of crutches, that he was\r\noriginally destined to the misfortune of having a leg paralysed or\r\namputated.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 113\\17: \"Je me garde de prêter à Dieu aucune intention.\"\r\n_Phil. Zool._ 10.]\r\n\r\n[Note 114\\17: \"Je ne connais point d'animal qui DOIVE jouer un rôle\r\ndans la nature.\" p. 65.]\r\n\r\nHow far this doctrine of unity in the plan in animals, is admissible\r\nor probable in physiology when kept within proper limits, that is,\r\nwhen not put in opposition to the doctrine of a purpose involved in\r\nthe plan of animals, I do not pretend even to conjecture. The\r\nquestion is one which appears to be at present deeply occupying the\r\nminds of the most learned and profound physiologists; and such\r\npersons alone, adding to their knowledge and zeal, judicial sagacity\r\nand impartiality, can tell us what is the general tendency of the\r\nbest researches on this subject.[115\\17] But when the anatomist\r\nexpresses such opinions, and defends them by such illustrations as\r\nthose which I have just quoted,[116\\17] we perceive that he quits\r\nthe entrenchments of his superior science, in which he might {487}\r\nhave remained unassailable so long as the question was a\r\nprofessional one; and the discussion is open to those who possess no\r\npeculiar knowledge of anatomy. We shall, therefore, venture to say a\r\nfew words upon it.\r\n\r\n[Note 115\\17: So far as this doctrine is generally accepted among\r\nthe best physiologists, we cannot doubt the propriety of Meckel's\r\nremark, (_Comparative Anatomy_, 1821, Pref. p. xi.) that it cannot\r\nbe truly asserted either to be new, or to be peculiarly due to\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire.]\r\n\r\n[Note 116\\17: It is hardly worth while answering such illustrations,\r\nbut I may remark, that the one quoted above, irrelevant and\r\nunbecoming as it is, tells altogether against its author. The fact\r\nthat the wooden leg is of the same length as the other, proves, and\r\nwould satisfy the most incredulous man, that it was _intended_ for\r\nwalking.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Estimate of the Doctrine of Unity of Plan._\r\n\r\nIT has been so often repeated, and so generally allowed in modern\r\ntimes, that Final Causes ought not to be made our guides in natural\r\nphilosophy, that a prejudice has been established against the\r\nintroduction of any views to which this designation can be applied,\r\ninto physical speculations. Yet, in fact, the assumption of an end\r\nor purpose in the structure of organized beings, appears to be an\r\nintellectual habit which no efforts can cast off. It has prevailed\r\nfrom the earliest to the latest ages of zoological research; appears\r\nto be fastened upon us alike by our ignorance and our knowledge; and\r\nhas been formally accepted by so many great anatomists, that we\r\ncannot feel any scruple in believing the rejection of it to be the\r\nsuperstition of a false philosophy, and a result of the exaggeration\r\nof other principles which are supposed capable of superseding its\r\nuse. And the doctrine of unity of plan of all animals, and the other\r\nprinciples associated with this doctrine, so far as they exclude the\r\nconviction of an intelligible scheme and a discoverable end, in the\r\norganization of animals, appear to be utterly erroneous. I will\r\noffer a few reasons for an opinion which may appear presumptuous in\r\na writer who has only a general knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, it appears to me that the argumentation on\r\nthe case in question, the Sepia, does by no means turn out to the\r\nadvantage of the new hypothesis. The arguments in support of the\r\nhypothetical view of the structure of this mollusc were, that by\r\nthis view the relative position of the parts was explained, and\r\nconfirmations which had appeared altogether anomalous, were reduced\r\nto rule; for example, the beak, which had been supposed to be in a\r\nposition the reverse of all other beaks, was shown, by the assumed\r\nposture, to have its upper mandible longer than the lower, and thus\r\nto be regularly placed. \"But,\" says Cuvier,[117\\17] \"supposing the\r\nposture, in order that the side on which the funnel of the sepia is\r\nfolded should be the back of the animal, considered as similar to a\r\nvertebrate, the brain with {488} regard to the beak, and the\r\nœsophagus with regard to the liver, should have positions\r\ncorresponding to those in vertebrates; but the positions of these\r\norgans are exactly contrary to the hypothesis. How, then, can you\r\nsay,\" he asks, \"that the cephalopods and vertebrates have _identity\r\nof composition_, _unity of composition_, without using words in a\r\nsense entirely different from their common meaning?\"\r\n\r\n[Note 117\\17: _G. S. H. Phil. Zool._ p. 70.]\r\n\r\nThis argument appears to be exactly of the kind on which the value\r\nof the hypothesis must depend.[118\\17] It is, therefore, interesting\r\nto see the reply made to it by the theorist. It is this: \"I admit\r\nthe facts here stated, but I deny that they lead to the notion of a\r\ndifferent sort of animal composition. Molluscous animals had been\r\nplaced too high in the zoological scale; but if they are only the\r\nembryos of its lower stages, if they are only beings in which far\r\nfewer organs come into play, it does not follow that the organs are\r\ndestitute of the relations which the power of successive generations\r\nmay demand. The organ A will be in an unusual relation with the\r\norgan C, if B has not been produced;--if a stoppage of the\r\ndevelopement has fallen upon this latter organ, and has thus\r\nprevented its production. And thus,\" he says, \"we see how we may\r\nhave different arrangements, and divers constructions as they appear\r\nto the eye.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 118\\17: I do not dwell on other arguments which were employed.\r\nIt was given as a circumstance suggesting the supposed posture of\r\nthe type, that in this way the back was colored, and the belly was\r\nwhite. On this Cuvier observes (_Phil. Zool._ pp. 93, 68), \"I must\r\nsay, that I do not know any naturalist so ignorant as to suppose\r\nthat the back is determined by its dark color, or even by its\r\nposition when the animal is in motion; they all know that the badger\r\nhas a black belly and a white back; that an infinity of other\r\nanimals, especially among insects, are in the same case; and that\r\nmany fishes swim on their side, or with their belly upwards.\"]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that such a concession as this entirely destroys the\r\ntheory which it attempts to defend; for what arrangement does the\r\nprinciple of unity of composition _exclude_, if it admits unusual,\r\nthat is, various arrangements of some organs, accompanied by the\r\ntotal absence of others? Or how does this differ from Cuvier's mode\r\nof stating the conclusion, except in the introduction of certain\r\narbitrary hypotheses of developement and stoppage? \"I reduce the\r\nfacts,\" Cuvier says, \"to their true expression, by saying that\r\nCephalopods have several organs which are common to them and\r\nvertebrates, and which discharge the same offices; but that these\r\norgans are in them differently distributed, and often constructed in\r\na different manner; {489} and they are accompanied by several other\r\norgans which vertebrates have not; while these on the other hand\r\nhave several which are wanting in cephalopods.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see afterwards the general principles which Cuvier himself\r\nconsidered as the best guides in these reasonings. But I will first\r\nadd a few words on the disposition of the school now under\r\nconsideration, to reject all assumption of an end.\r\n\r\n2. That the parts of the bodies of animals are made in order to\r\ndischarge their respective offices, is a conviction which we cannot\r\nbelieve to be otherwise than an irremovable principle of the\r\nphilosophy of organization, when we see the manner in which it has\r\nconstantly forced itself upon the minds of zoologists and anatomists\r\nin all ages; not only as an inference, but as a guide whose\r\nindications they could not help following. I have already noticed\r\nexpressions of this conviction in some of the principal persons who\r\noccur in the history of physiology, as Galen and Harvey. I might add\r\nmany more, but I will content myself with adducing a contemporary of\r\nGeoffroy's whose testimony is the more remarkable, because he\r\nobviously shares with his countryman in the common prejudice against\r\nthe use of final causes. \"I consider,\" he says, in speaking of the\r\nprovisions for the reproduction of animals,[119\\17] \"with the great\r\nBacon, the philosophy of final causes as sterile; but I have\r\nelsewhere acknowledged that it was very difficult for the most\r\ncautious man never to have recourse to them in his explanations.\"\r\nAfter the survey which we have had to take of the history of\r\nphysiology, we cannot but see that the assumption of final causes in\r\nthis branch of science is so far from being sterile, that it has had\r\na large share in every discovery which is included in the existing\r\nmass of real knowledge. The use of every organ has been discovered\r\nby starting from the assumption that it must have _some_ use. The\r\ndoctrine of the circulation of the blood was, as we have seen,\r\nclearly and professedly due to the persuasion of a purpose in the\r\ncirculatory apparatus. The study of comparative anatomy is the study\r\nof the adaption of animal structures to their purposes. And we shall\r\nsoon have to show that this conception of final causes has, in our\r\nown times, been so far from barren, that it has, in the hands of\r\nCuvier and others, enabled us to become intimately acquainted with\r\nvast departments of zoology to which we have no other mode of\r\naccess. It has placed before us in a complete state, {490} animals,\r\nof which, for thousands of years, only a few fragments have existed,\r\nand which differ widely from all existing animals; and it has given\r\nbirth, or at least has given the greatest part of its importance and\r\ninterest, to a science which forms one of the brightest parts of the\r\nmodern progress of knowledge. It is, therefore, very far from being\r\na vague and empty assertion, when we say that final causes are a\r\nreal and indestructible element in zoological philosophy; and that\r\nthe exclusion of them, as attempted by the school of which we speak,\r\nis a fundamental and most mischievous error.\r\n\r\n[Note 119\\17: Cabanis, _Rapports du Physique et du Morale de\r\nl'Homme_, i. **299.]\r\n\r\n3. Thus, though the physiologist may persuade himself that he ought\r\nnot to refer to final causes, we find that, practically, he cannot\r\nhelp doing this; and that the event shows that his practical habit\r\nis right and well-founded. But he may still cling to the speculative\r\ndifficulties and doubts in which such subjects may be involved by _à\r\npriori_ considerations. He may say, as Saint-Hilaire does\r\nsay,[120\\17] \"I ascribe no intention to God, for I mistrust the\r\nfeeble powers of my reason. I observe facts merely, and go no\r\nfurther. I only pretend to the character of the historian of _what\r\nis_.\" \"I cannot make Nature an intelligent being who does nothing in\r\nvain, who acts by the shortest mode, who does all for the best.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 120\\17: _Phil. Zool._ p. 10.]\r\n\r\nI am not going to enter at any length into this subject, which, thus\r\nconsidered, is metaphysical and theological, rather than\r\nphysiological. If any one maintain, as some have maintained, that no\r\nmanifestation of means apparently used for ends in nature, can prove\r\nthe existence of design in the Author of nature, this is not the\r\nplace to refute such an opinion in its general form. But I think it\r\nmay be worth while to show, that even those who incline to such an\r\nopinion, still cannot resist the necessity which compels men to\r\nassume, in organized beings, the existence of an end.\r\n\r\nAmong the philosophers who have referred our conviction of the being\r\nof God to our moral nature, and have denied the possibility of\r\ndemonstration on mere physical grounds, Kant is perhaps the most\r\neminent. Yet he has asserted the reality of such a principle of\r\nphysiology as we are now maintaining in the most emphatic manner.\r\nIndeed, this assumption of an end makes his very definition of an\r\norganized being. \"An organized product of nature is that in which\r\nall the parts are mutually ends and means.\"[121\\17] And this, he\r\nsays, is a universal and necessary maxim. He adds, \"It is well known\r\nthat the {491} anatomizers of plants and animals, in order to\r\ninvestigate their structure, and to obtain an insight into the\r\ngrounds why and to what end such parts, why such a situation and\r\nconnexion of the parts, and exactly such an internal form, come\r\nbefore them, assume, as indispensably necessary, this maxim, that in\r\nsuch a creature nothing is _in vain_, and proceed upon it in the\r\nsame way in which in general natural philosophy we proceed upon the\r\nprinciple that _nothing happens by chance_. In fact, they can as\r\nlittle free themselves from this _teleological_ principle as from\r\nthe general physical one; for as, on omitting the latter, no\r\nexperience would be possible, so on omitting the former principle,\r\nno clue could exist for the observation of a kind of natural objects\r\nwhich can be considered teleologically under the conception of\r\nnatural ends.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 121\\17: _Urtheilskraft_, p. 296.]\r\n\r\nEven if the reader should not follow the reasoning of this\r\ncelebrated philosopher, he will still have no difficulty in seeing\r\nthat he asserts, in the most distinct manner, that which is denied\r\nby the author whom we have before quoted, the propriety and\r\nnecessity of assuming the existence of an end as our guide in the\r\nstudy of animal organization.\r\n\r\n4. It appears to me, therefore, that whether we judge from the\r\narguments, the results, the practice of physiologists, their\r\nspeculative opinions, or those of the philosophers of a wider field,\r\nwe are led to the same conviction, that in the organized world we\r\nmay and must adopt the belief that organization exists for its\r\npurpose, and that the apprehension of the purpose may guide us in\r\nseeing the meaning of the organization. And I now proceed to show\r\nhow this principle has been brought into additional clearness and\r\nuse by Cuvier.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, I may, perhaps, be allowed to make a reflection of a\r\nkind somewhat different from the preceding remarks, though suggested\r\nby them. In another work,[122\\17] I endeavored to show that those\r\nwho have been discoverers in science have generally had minds, the\r\ndisposition of which was to believe in an intelligent Maker of the\r\nuniverse; and that the scientific speculations which produced an\r\nopposite tendency, were generally those which, though they might\r\ndeal familiarly with known physical truths, and conjecture boldly\r\nwith regard to the unknown, did not add to the number of solid\r\ngeneralizations. In order to judge whether this remark is distinctly\r\napplicable in the case now considered, I should have to estimate\r\nCuvier in comparison with other physiologists of his time, which I\r\ndo not presume to do. But I may {492} observe, that he is allowed by\r\nall to have established, on an indestructible basis, many of the\r\nmost important generalizations which zoology now contains; and the\r\nprincipal defect which his critics have pointed out, has been, that\r\nhe did not generalize still more widely and boldly. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that he cannot but be placed among the great discoverers\r\nin the studies which he pursued; and this being the case, those who\r\nlook with pleasure on the tendency of the thoughts of the greatest\r\nmen to an Intelligence far higher than their own, most be gratified\r\nto find that he was an example of this tendency; and that the\r\nacknowledgement of a creative purpose, as well as a creative power,\r\nnot only entered into his belief but made an indispensable and\r\nprominent part of his philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Note 122\\17: _Bridgewater Treatise_, B. iii. c. vii. and viii. On\r\nInductive Habits of Thought, and on Deductive Habits of Thought.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Establishment and Application of the Principle of the\r\nConditions of Existence of Animals.--Cuvier._\r\n\r\nWE have now to describe more in detail the doctrine which Cuvier\r\nmaintained in opposition to such opinions as we have been speaking\r\nof; and which, in his way of applying it, we look upon as a material\r\nadvance in physiological knowledge, and therefore give to it a\r\ndistinct place in our history. \"Zoology has,\" he says,[123\\17] in\r\nthe outset of his _Règne Animal_, \"a principle of reasoning which is\r\npeculiar to it, and which it employs with advantage on many\r\noccasions: this is the principle of _the Conditions of Existence_,\r\nvulgarly the principle of _Final Causes_. As nothing can exist if it\r\ndo not combine all the conditions which render its existence\r\npossible, the different parts of each being must be co-ordinated in\r\nsuch a manner as to render the total being possible, not only in\r\nitself, but in its relations to those which surround it; and the\r\nanalysis of these conditions often leads to general laws, as clearly\r\ndemonstrated as those which result from calculation or from\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 123\\17: _Règne An._ p. 6.]\r\n\r\nThis is the enunciation of his leading principle in general terms.\r\nTo our ascribing it to him, some may object on the ground of its\r\nbeing self-evident in its nature,[124\\17] and having been very\r\nanciently applied. But to this we reply, that the principle must be\r\nconsidered as a real discovery in the hands of him who first shows\r\nhow to make it an instrument of other discoveries. It is true, in\r\nother cases as well as in this, that some vague apprehension, of\r\ntrue general principles, such as _à_ {493} _priori_ considerations\r\ncan supply, has long preceded the knowledge of them as real and\r\nverified laws. In such a way it was seen, before Newton, that the\r\nmotions of the planets must result from attraction; and so, before\r\nDufay and Franklin, it was held that electrical actions must result\r\nfrom a fluid. Cuvier's merit consisted, not in seeing that an animal\r\ncannot exist without combining all the conditions of its existence;\r\nbut in perceiving that this truth may be taken as a guide in our\r\nresearches concerning animals;--that the mode of their existence may\r\nbe collected from one part of their structure, and then applied to\r\ninterpret or detect another part. He went on the supposition not\r\nonly that animal forms have _some_ plan, _some_ purpose, but that\r\nthey have an intelligible plan, a discoverable purpose. He proceeded\r\nin his investigations like the decipherer of a manuscript, who makes\r\nout his alphabet from one part of the context, and then applies it\r\nto read the rest. The proof that his principle was something very\r\ndifferent from an identical proposition, is to be found in the fact,\r\nthat it enabled him to understand and arrange the structures of\r\nanimals with unprecedented clearness and completeness of order; and\r\nto restore the forms of the extinct animals which are found in the\r\nrocks of the earth, in a manner which has been universally assented\r\nto as irresistibly convincing. These results cannot flow from a\r\ntrifling or barren principle; and they show us that if we are\r\ndisposed to form such a judgment of Cuvier's doctrine, it must be\r\nbecause we do not fully apprehend its import.\r\n\r\n[Note 124\\17: Swainson. _Study of Nat. Hist._ p. 85.]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, we need only quote the statement which he makes,\r\nand the uses to which he applies it. Thus in the Introduction to his\r\ngreat work on _Fossil Remains_ he says, \"Every organized being forms\r\nan entire system of its own, all the parts of which mutually\r\ncorrespond, and concur to produce a certain definite purpose by\r\nreciprocal reaction, or by combining to the same end. Hence none of\r\nthese separate parts can change their forms without a corresponding\r\nchange in the other parts of the same animal; and consequently each of\r\nthese parts, taken separately, indicates all the other parts to which\r\nit has belonged. Thus, if the viscera of an animal are so organized as\r\nonly to be fitted for the digestion of recent flesh, it is also\r\nrequisite that the jaws should be so constructed as to fit them for\r\ndevouring prey; the claws must be constructed for seizing it and\r\ntearing it to pieces; the teeth for cutting and dividing its flesh;\r\nthe entire system of the limbs or organs of motion for pursuing and\r\novertaking it; and the organs of sense for discovering it at a\r\ndistance. Nature must also have endowed the brain of the animal with\r\ninstincts sufficient for concealing itself and for laying plans to\r\n{494} catch its necessary victims.\"[125\\17] By such considerations he\r\nhas been able to reconstruct the whole of many animals of which parts\r\nonly were given;--a positive result, which shows both the reality and\r\nthe value of the truth on which he wrought.\r\n\r\n[Note 125\\17: _Theory of the Earth_, p. 90.]\r\n\r\nAnother great example, equally showing the immense importance of\r\nthis principle in Cuvier's hands, is the reform which, by means of\r\nit, he introduced into the classification of animals. Here again we\r\nmay quote the view he himself has given[126\\17] of the character of\r\nhis own improvements. In studying the physiology of the natural\r\nclasses of vertebrate animals, he found, he says, \"in the respective\r\nquantity of their respiration, the reason of the quantity of their\r\nmotion, and consequently of the kind of locomotion. This, again,\r\nfurnishes the reason for the forms of their skeletons and muscles;\r\nand the energy of their senses, and the force of their digestion,\r\nare in a necessary proportion to the same quantity. Thus a division\r\nwhich had till then been established, like that of vegetables, only\r\nupon observation, was found to rest upon causes appreciable, and\r\napplicable to other cases.\" Accordingly, he applied this view to\r\ninvertebrates;--examined the modifications which take place in their\r\norgans of circulation, respiration, and sensation; and having\r\ncalculated the necessary results of these modifications, he deduced\r\nfrom it a new division of those animals, in which they are arranged\r\naccording to their true relations.\r\n\r\n[Note 126\\17: _Hist. Sc. Nat._ i. 293.]\r\n\r\nSuch have been some of the results of the principle of the\r\nConditions of Existence, as applied by its great assertor.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, indeed, that such a principle could acquire its\r\npractical value only in the hands of a person intimately acquainted\r\nwith anatomical details, with the functions of the organs, and with\r\ntheir variety in different animals. It is only by means of such\r\nnutriment that the embryo truth could be developed into a vast tree\r\nof science. But it is not the less clear, that Cuvier's immense\r\nknowledge and great powers of thought led to their results, only by\r\nbeing employed under the guidance of this master-principle: and,\r\ntherefore, we may justly consider it as the distinctive feature of\r\nhis speculations, and follow it with a gratified eye, as the thread\r\nof gold which runs through, connects, and enriches his zoological\r\nresearches:--gives them a deeper interest and a higher value than\r\ncan belong to any view of the organical sciences, in which the very\r\nessence of organization is kept out of sight. {495}\r\n\r\nThe real philosopher, who knows that all the kinds of truth are\r\nintimately connected, and that all the best hopes and encouragements\r\nwhich are granted to our nature must be consistent with truth, will be\r\nsatisfied and confirmed, rather than surprised and disturbed, thus to\r\nfind the Natural Sciences leading him to the borders of a higher\r\nregion. To him it will appear natural and reasonable, that after\r\njourneying so long among the beautiful and orderly laws by which the\r\nuniverse is governed, we find ourselves at last approaching to a\r\nSource of order and law, and intellectual beauty:--that, after\r\nventuring into the region of life and feeling and will, we are led to\r\nbelieve the Fountain of life and will not to be itself unintelligent\r\nand dead, but to be a living Mind, a Power which aims as well as acts.\r\nTo us this doctrine appears like the natural cadence of the tones to\r\nwhich we have so long been listening; and without such a final strain\r\nour ears would have been left craving and unsatisfied. We have been\r\nlingering long amid the harmonies of law and symmetry, constancy and\r\ndevelopment; and these notes, though their music was sweet and deep,\r\nmust too often have sounded to the ear of our moral nature, as vague\r\nand unmeaning melodies, floating in the air around us, but conveying\r\nno definite thought, moulded into no intelligible announcement. But\r\none passage which we have again and again caught by snatches, though\r\nsometimes interrupted and lost, at last swells in our ears full,\r\nclear, and decided; and the religious \"Hymn in honor of the Creator,\"\r\nto which Galen so gladly lent his voice, and in which the best\r\nphysiologists of succeeding times have ever joined, is filled into a\r\nricher and deeper harmony by the greatest philosophers of these later\r\ndays, and will roll on hereafter the \"perpetual song\" of the temple of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{497}}\r\nBOOK XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PALÆTIOLOGICAL SCIENCES._\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Di quibus imperium est animarum, Umbræque silentes,\r\n  Et Chaos, et Phlegethon, loca nocte silentia late,\r\n  Sit mihi fas audita loqui; sit, numine vestro\r\n  Pandere res alta terrâ et caligine mersas.\r\n          VIRGIL. _Æn._ vi. 264.\r\n\r\n  Ye Mighty Ones, who sway the Souls that go\r\n  Amid the marvels of the world below!\r\n  Ye, silent Shades, who sit and hear around!\r\n  Chaos! and Streams that burn beneath the ground!\r\n  All, all forgive, if by your converse stirred,\r\n  My lips shall utter what my ears have heard;\r\n  If I shall speak of things of doubtful birth,\r\n  Deep sunk in darkness, as deep sunk in earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{499}}\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Palætiological Sciences._\r\n\r\nWE now approach the last Class of Sciences which enter into the\r\ndesign of the present work; and of these, Geology is the\r\nrepresentative, whose history we shall therefore briefly follow. By\r\nthe Class of Sciences to which I have referred it, I mean to point\r\nout those researches in which the object is, to ascend from the\r\npresent state of things to a more ancient condition, from which the\r\npresent is derived by intelligible causes.\r\n\r\nThe sciences which treat of causes have sometimes been termed\r\n_ætiological_, from αἰτία, _a cause_: but this term would not\r\nsufficiently describe the speculations of which we now speak; since\r\nit might include sciences which treat of Permanent Causality, like\r\nMechanics, as well as inquiries concerning Progressive Causation.\r\nThe investigations which I now wish to group together, deal, not\r\nonly with the possible, but with the actual past; and a portion of\r\nthat science on which we are about to enter, Geology, has properly\r\nbeen termed _Palæontology_, since it treats of beings which formerly\r\nexisted.[1\\18] Hence, combining these two notions,[2\\18]\r\n_Palætiology_ appears to be a term not inappropriate, to describe\r\nthose speculations which thus refer to actual past events, and\r\nattempt to explain them by laws of causation.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\18: Πάλαι, ὄντα]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\18: Πάλαι, αἰτία]\r\n\r\nSuch speculations are not confined to the world of inert matter; we\r\nhave examples of them in inquiries concerning the monuments of the\r\nart and labor of distant ages; in examinations into the origin and\r\nearly progress of states and cities, customs and languages; as well\r\nas in researches concerning the causes and formations of mountains\r\nand rocks, the imbedding of fossils in strata, and their elevation\r\nfrom the bottom of the ocean. All these speculations are connected\r\nby this bond,--that they endeavor to ascend to a past state of\r\nthings, by the aid of the evidence of the present. In asserting,\r\nwith Cuvier, that {500} \"The geologist is an antiquary of a new\r\norder,\" we do not mark a fanciful and superficial resemblance of\r\nemployment merely, but a real and philosophical connexion of the\r\nprinciples of investigation. The organic fossils which occur in the\r\nrock, and the medals which we find in the ruins of ancient cities,\r\nare to be studied in a similar spirit and for a similar purpose.\r\nIndeed, it is not always easy to know where the task of the\r\ngeologist ends, and that of the antiquary begins. The study of\r\nancient geography may involve us in the examination of the causes by\r\nwhich the forms of coasts and plains are changed; the ancient mound\r\nor scarped rock may force upon us the problem, whether its form is\r\nthe work of nature or of man; the ruined temple may exhibit the\r\ntraces of time in its changed level, and sea-worn columns; and thus\r\nthe antiquarian of the earth may be brought into the very middle of\r\nthe domain belonging to the antiquarian of art.\r\n\r\nSuch a union of these different kinds of archæological\r\ninvestigations has, in fact, repeatedly occurred. The changes which\r\nhave taken place in the temple of Jupiter Serapis, near Puzzuoli,\r\nare of the sort which have just been described; and this is only one\r\nexample of a large class of objects;--the monuments of art converted\r\ninto records of natural events. And on a wider scale, we find\r\nCuvier, in his inquiries into geological changes, bringing together\r\nhistorical and physical evidence. Dr. Prichard, in his _Researches\r\ninto the Physical History of Man_, has shown that to execute such a\r\ndesign as his, we must combine the knowledge of the physiological\r\nlaws of nature with the traditions of history and the philosophical\r\ncomparison of languages. And even if we refuse to admit, as part of\r\nthe business of geology, inquiries concerning the origin and\r\nphysical history of the present population of the globe; still the\r\ngeologist is compelled to take an interest in such inquiries, in\r\norder to understand matters which rigorously belong to his proper\r\ndomain; for the ascertained history of the present state of things\r\noffers the best means of throwing light upon the causes of _past_\r\nchanges. Mr. Lyell quotes Dr. Prichard's book more frequently than\r\nany geological work of the same extent.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may notice another common circumstance in the studies\r\nwhich we are grouping together as palætiological, diverse as they\r\nare in their subjects. In all of them we have the same kind of\r\nmanifestations of a number of successive changes, each springing out\r\nof a preceding state; and in all, the phenomena at each step become\r\nmore and more complicated, by involving the results of all that has\r\npreceded, modified by supervening agencies. The general aspect of\r\nall these {501} trains of change is similar, and offers the same\r\nfeatures for description. The relics and ruins of the earlier states\r\nare preserved, mutilated and dead, in the products of later times.\r\nThe analogical figures by which we are tempted to express this\r\nrelation are philosophically true. It is more than a mere fanciful\r\ndescription, to say that in languages, customs, forms of Society,\r\npolitical institutions, we see a number of formations super-imposed\r\nupon one another, each of which is, for the most part, an assemblage\r\nof fragments and results of the preceding condition. Though our\r\ncomparison might be bold, it would be just, if we were to assert,\r\nthat the English language is a conglomerate of Latin words, bound\r\ntogether in a Saxon cement; the fragments of the Latin being partly\r\nportions introduced directly from the parent quarry, with all their\r\nsharp edges, and partly pebbles of the same material, obscured and\r\nshaped by long rolling in a Norman or some other channel. Thus the\r\nstudy of palætiology in the materials of the earth, is only a type\r\nof similar studies with respect to all the elements, which, in the\r\nhistory of the earth's inhabitants, have been constantly undergoing\r\na series of connected changes.\r\n\r\nBut, wide as is the view which such considerations give us of the\r\nclass of sciences to which geology belongs, they extend still\r\nfurther. \"The science of the changes which have taken place in the\r\norganic kingdoms of nature,\" (such is the description which has been\r\ngiven of Geology,[3\\18]) may, by following another set of\r\nconnexions, be extended beyond \"the modifications of the surface of\r\nour own planet.\" For we cannot doubt that some resemblance of a\r\ncloser or looser kind, has obtained between the changes and causes\r\nof change, on other bodies of the universe, and on our own. The\r\nappearances of something of the kind of volcanic action on the\r\nsurface of the moon, are not to be mistaken. And the inquiries\r\nconcerning the origin of our planet and of our solar system,\r\ninquiries to which Geology irresistibly impels her students, direct\r\nus to ask what information the rest of the universe can supply,\r\nbearing upon this subject. It has been thought by some, that we can\r\ntrace systems, more or less like our solar system, in the process of\r\nformation; the nebulous matter, which is at first expansive and\r\nattenuated, condensing gradually into suns and planets. Whether this\r\n_Nebular Hypothesis_ be tenable or not, I shall not here inquire;\r\nbut the discussion of such a question would be closely connected\r\nwith {502} geology, both in its interests and in its methods. If men\r\nare ever able to frame a science of the past changes by which the\r\nuniverse has been brought into its present condition, this science\r\nwill be properly described as _Cosmical Palætiology_.\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\18: Lyell, _Principles of Geology_, p. 1.]\r\n\r\nThese palætiological sciences might properly be called _historical_,\r\nif that term were sufficiently precise: for they are all of the\r\nnature of history, being concerned with the succession of events:\r\nand the part of history which deals with the past causes of events,\r\nis, in fact, a moral palætiology. But the phrase _Natural History_\r\nhas so accustomed us to a use of the word _history_ in which we have\r\nnothing to do with time, that, if we were to employ the word\r\n_historical_ to describe the palætiological sciences, it would be in\r\nconstant danger of being misunderstood. The fact is, as Mohs has\r\nsaid, that Natural History, when systematically treated, rigorously\r\nexcludes all that is _historical_; for it classes objects by their\r\npermanent and universal properties, and has nothing to do with the\r\nnarration of particular and casual facts. And this is an\r\ninconsistency which we shall not attempt to rectify.\r\n\r\nAll palætiological sciences, since they undertake to refer changes\r\nto their causes, assume a certain classification of the phenomena\r\nwhich change brings forth, and a knowledge of the operation of the\r\ncauses of change. These phenomena, these causes, are very different,\r\nin the branches of knowledge which I have thus classed together. The\r\nnatural features of the earth's surface, the works of art, the\r\ninstitutions of society, the forms of language, taken together, are\r\nundoubtedly a very wide collection of subjects of speculation; and\r\nthe kinds of causation which apply to them are no less varied. Of\r\nthe causes of change in the inorganic and organic world,--the\r\npeculiar principles of Geology--we shall hereafter have to speak. As\r\nthese must be studied by the geologist, so, in like manner, the\r\ntendencies, instincts, faculties, principles, which direct man to\r\narchitecture and sculpture, to civil government, to rational and\r\ngrammatical speech, and which have determined the circumstances of\r\nhis progress in these paths, must be in a great degree known to the\r\nPalætiologist of Art, of Society, and of Language, respectively, in\r\norder that he may speculate soundly upon his peculiar subject. With\r\nthese matters we shall not here meddle, confining ourselves, in our\r\nexemplification of the conditions and progress of such sciences, to\r\nthe case of Geology.\r\n\r\nThe journey of survey which we have attempted to perform over the\r\nfield of human knowledge, although carefully directed according to\r\nthe paths and divisions of the physical sciences, has already {503}\r\nconducted us to the boundaries of physical science, and gives us a\r\nglimpse of the region beyond. In following the history of Life, we\r\nfound ourselves led to notice the perceptive and active faculties of\r\nman; it appeared that there was a ready passage from physiology to\r\npsychology, from physics to metaphysics. In the class of sciences\r\nnow under notice, we are, at a different point, carried from the\r\nworld of matter to the world of thought and feeling,--from things to\r\nmen. For, as we have already said, the science of the causes of\r\nchange includes the productions of Man as well as of Nature. The\r\nhistory of the earth, and the history of the earth's inhabitants, as\r\ncollected from phenomena, are governed by the same principles. Thus\r\nthe portions of knowledge which seek to travel back towards the\r\norigin, whether of inert things or of the works of man, resemble\r\neach other. Both of them treat of events as connected by the thread\r\nof time and causation. In both we endeavor to learn accurately what\r\nthe present is, and hence what the past has been. Both are\r\n_historical_ sciences in the same sense.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that I am now speaking of history as\r\nætiological;--as it investigates causes, and as it does this in a\r\nscientific, that is, in a rigorous and systematic, manner. And I may\r\nobserve here, though I cannot now dwell on the subject, that all\r\nætiological sciences will consist of three portions; the Description\r\nof the facts and phenomena;--the general Theory of the causes of\r\nchange appropriate to the case;--and the Application of the theory\r\nto the facts. Thus, taking Geology for our example, we must have,\r\nfirst _Descriptive_ or _Phenomenal_ Geology; next, the exposition of\r\nthe general principles by which such phenomena can be produced,\r\nwhich we may term _Geological Dynamics_; and, lastly, doctrines\r\nhence derived, as to what have been the causes of the existing state\r\nof things, which we may call _Physical Geology_.\r\n\r\nThese three branches of geology may be found frequently or\r\nconstantly combined in the works of writers on the subject, and it\r\nmay not always be easy to discriminate exactly what belongs to each\r\nsubject.[4\\18] But the analogy of this science with others, its\r\npresent {504} condition and future fortunes, will derive great\r\nillustration from such a distribution of its history; and in this\r\npoint of view, therefore, we shall briefly treat of it; dividing the\r\nhistory of Geological Dynamics, for the sake of convenience, into\r\ntwo Chapters, one referring to inorganic, and one to organic,\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\18: The Wernerians, in distinguishing their study from\r\n_Geology_, and designating it as _Geognosy_, the _knowledge_ of the\r\nearth, appear to have intended to select Descriptive Geology for\r\ntheir peculiar field. In like manner, the original aim of the\r\nGeological Society of London, which was formed (1807) \"with a view\r\nto record and multiply observations,\" recognized the possibility of\r\na Descriptive Geology separate from the other portions of the\r\nscience.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{505}}\r\nDESCRIPTIVE GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIVE GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Ancient Notices of Geological Facts._\r\n\r\nTHE recent history of Geology, as to its most important points, is\r\nbound up with what is doing at present from day to day; and that\r\nportion of the history of the science which belongs to the past, has\r\nbeen amply treated by other writers.[5\\18] I shall, therefore, pass\r\nrapidly over the series of events of which this history consists;\r\nand shall only attempt to mention what may seem to illustrate and\r\nconfirm my own view of its state and principles.\r\n\r\n[Note 5\\18: As MM. Lyell, Fitton, Conybeare, in our own country.]\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the order already pointed out, I shall notice, in the\r\nfirst place, Phenomenal Geology, or the description of the facts, as\r\ndistinct from the inquiry into their causes. It is manifest that\r\nsuch a merely descriptive kind of knowledge may exist; and it\r\nprobably will not be contested, that such knowledge ought to be\r\ncollected, before we attempt to frame theories concerning the causes\r\nof the phenomena. But it must be observed, that we are here speaking\r\nof the formation of a _science_; and that it is not a collection of\r\nmiscellaneous, unconnected, unarranged knowledge that can be\r\nconsidered as constituting science; but a methodical, coherent, and,\r\nas far as possible, complete body of facts, exhibiting fully the\r\ncondition of the earth as regards those circumstances which are the\r\nsubject matter of geological speculation. Such a Descriptive Geology\r\nis a pre-requisite to Physical Geology, just as Phenomenal Astronomy\r\nnecessarily preceded Physical Astronomy, or as Classificatory Botany\r\nis a necessary accompaniment to Botanical Physiology. We may observe\r\nalso that Descriptive Geology, such as we now speak of, is one of\r\nthe classificatory sciences, like {506} Mineralogy or Botany: and\r\nwill be found to exhibit some of the features of that class of\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nSince, then, our History of Descriptive Geology is to include only\r\nsystematic and scientific descriptions of the earth or portions of\r\nit, we pass over, at once, all the casual and insulated statements\r\nof facts, though they may be geological facts, which occur in early\r\nwriters; such, for instance, as the remark of Herodotus,[6\\18] that\r\nthere are shells in the mountains of Egypt; or the general\r\nstatements which Ovid puts in the mouth of Pythagoras:[7\\18]\r\n    Vidi ego quod fuerat solidissima tellus,\r\n  Esse fretum; vidi factas ex æquore terras,\r\n  Et procul a pelago conchæ jacuere marinæ.\r\n\r\n[Note 6\\18: ii. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7\\18: Met. xv. 262.]\r\n\r\nWe may remark here already how generally there are mingled with\r\ndescriptive notices of such geological facts, speculations\r\nconcerning their causes. Herodotus refers to the circumstance just\r\nquoted, for the purpose of showing that Egypt was formerly a gulf of\r\nthe sea; and the passage of the Roman poet is part of a series of\r\nexemplifications which he gives of the philosophical tenet, that\r\nnothing perishes but everything changes. It will be only by constant\r\nattention that we shall be able to keep our provinces of geology\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Early Descriptions and Collections of Fossils._\r\n\r\nIF we look, as we have proposed to do, for systematic and exact\r\nknowledge of geological facts, we find nothing which we can properly\r\nadduce till we come to modern times. But when facts such as those\r\nalready mentioned, (that sea-shells and other marine objects are\r\nfound imbedded in rocks,) and other circumstances in the structure\r\nof the Earth, had attracted considerable attention, the exact\r\nexamination, collection, and record of these circumstances began to\r\nbe attempted. Among such steps in Descriptive Geology, we may notice\r\ndescriptions and pictures of fossils, descriptions of veins and\r\nmines, collections of organic and inorganic fossils, maps of the\r\nmineral structure of countries, and finally, the discoveries\r\nconcerning the superposition of strata, the constancy of their\r\norganic contents, their correspondence in different countries, and\r\nsuch great general relations of the materials and features of the\r\nearth as have been discovered up to the present time. {507} Without\r\nattempting to assign to every important advance its author, I shall\r\nbriefly exemplify each of the modes of contributing to descriptive\r\ngeology which I have just enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe study of organic fossils was first pursued with connexion and\r\nsystem in Italy. The hills which on each side skirt the\r\nmountain-range of the Apennines are singularly rich in remains of\r\nmarine animals. When these remarkable objects drew the attention of\r\nthoughtful men, controversies soon arose whether they really were\r\nthe remains of living creatures, or the productions of some\r\ncapricious or mysterious power by which the forms of such creatures\r\nwere mimicked; and again, if the shells were really the spoils of\r\nthe sea, whether they had been carried to the hills by the deluge of\r\nwhich the Scripture speaks, or whether they indicated revolutions of\r\nthe earth of a different kind. The earlier works which contain the\r\ndescriptions of the phenomena have, in almost all instances, by far\r\nthe greater part of their pages occupied with these speculations;\r\nindeed, the facts could not be studied without leading to such\r\ninferences, and would not have been collected but for the interest\r\nwhich such reasonings possessed. As one of the first persons who\r\napplied a sound and vigorous intellect to these subjects, we may\r\nnotice the celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci, whom we have\r\nalready had to refer to as one of the founders of the modern\r\nmechanical sciences. He strenuously asserts the contents of the\r\nrocks to be real shells, and maintains the reality of the changes of\r\nthe domain of land and sea which these spoils of the ocean imply.\r\n\"You will tell me,\" he says, \"that nature and the influence of the\r\nstars have formed these shelly forms in the mountains; then show me\r\na place in the mountains where the stars at the present day make\r\nshelly forms of different ages, and of different species in the same\r\nplace. And how, with that, will you explain the gravel which is\r\nhardened in stages at different heights in the mountains?\" He then\r\nmentions several other particulars respecting these evidences that\r\nthe existing mountains were formerly in the bed of the sea. Leonardo\r\ndied in 1519. At present we refer to geological essays like his,\r\nonly so far as they are descriptive. Going onwards with this view,\r\nwe may notice Fracastoro, who wrote concerning the petrifactions\r\nwhich were brought to light in the mountains of Verona, when, in\r\n1517, they were excavated for the purpose of repairing the city.\r\nLittle was done in the way of collection of facts for some time\r\nafter this. In 1669, Steno, a Dane resident in Italy, put forth his\r\ntreatise, _De Solido intra Solidum naturaliter contento_; and the\r\n{508} following year, Augustino Scilla, a Sicilian painter,\r\npublished a Latin epistle, _De Corporibus Marinis Lapidescentibus_,\r\nillustrated by good engravings of fossil-shells, teeth, and\r\ncorals.[8\\18] After another interval of speculative controversy, we\r\ncome to Antonio Vallisneri, whose letters, _De' Corpi Marini che su'\r\nMonti si trovano_, appeared at Venice in 1721. In these letters he\r\ndescribes the fossils of Monte Bolca, and attempts to trace the\r\nextent of the marine deposits of Italy,[9\\18] and to distinguish the\r\nmost important of the fossils. Similar descriptions and figures were\r\npublished with reference to our own country at a later period. In\r\n1766, Brander's _Fossilia Hantoniensia_, or Hampshire Fossils,\r\nappeared; containing excellent figures of fossil shells from a part\r\nof the south coast of England; and similar works came forth in other\r\nparts of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\18: Augustine Scilla's original drawings of fossil shells,\r\nteeth, and corals, from which the engravings mentioned in the text\r\nwere executed, as well as the natural objects from which the\r\ndrawings were made, were bought by Woodward, and are now in the\r\nWoodwardian Museum at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\18: p. 20.]\r\n\r\nHowever exact might be the descriptions and figures thus produced,\r\nthey could not give such complete information as the objects\r\nthemselves, collected and permanently preserved in museums.\r\nVallisneri says,[10\\18] that having begun to collect fossils for the\r\npurpose of forming a grotto, he selected the best, and preserved\r\nthem \"as a noble diversion for the more curious.\" The museum of\r\nCalceolarius at Verona contained a celebrated collection of such\r\nremains. A copious description of it appeared in 1622. Such\r\ncollections had been made from an earlier period, and catalogues of\r\nthem published. Thus Gessner's work, _De Rerum Fossilium, Lapidum et\r\nGemmarum Figuris_ (1565), contains a catalogue of the cabinet of\r\npetrifactions collected by John Kentman; many catalogues of the same\r\nkind appeared in the seventeenth century.[11\\18] Lhwyd's\r\n_**Lythophylacii Britannici Iconographia_, published at Oxford in\r\n1669, and exhibiting a very ample catalogue of English Fossils\r\ncontained in the Ashmolean Museum, may be noticed as one of these.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\18: p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\18: Parkinson, _Organic Remains_, vol. i. p. 20.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable occurrences in the progress of\r\ndescriptive geology in England, was the formation of a geological\r\nmuseum by William Woodward as early as 1695. This collection, formed\r\nwith great labor, systematically arranged, and carefully catalogued,\r\nhe bequeathed to the University of Cambridge; founding and endowing\r\n{509} at the same time a professorship of the study of geology. The\r\nWoodwardian Museum still subsists, a monument of the sagacity with\r\nwhich its author so early saw the importance of such a collection.\r\n\r\nCollections and descriptions of fossils, including in the term\r\nspecimens of minerals of all kinds, as well as organic remains, were\r\nfrequently made, and especially in places where mining was\r\ncultivated; but under such circumstances, they scarcely tended at\r\nall to that general and complete knowledge of the earth of which we\r\nare now tracing the progress.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, collections may be said to be the most\r\nimportant books of the geologist, at least next to the strata\r\nthemselves. The identifications and arrangements of our best\r\ngeologists, the immense studies of fossil anatomy by Cuvier and\r\nothers, have been conducted mainly by means of collections of\r\nspecimens. They are more important in this study than in botany,\r\nbecause specimens which contain important geological information are\r\nboth more rare and more permanent. Plants, though each individual is\r\nperishable, perpetuate and diffuse their kind; while the organic\r\nimpression on a stone, if lost, may never occur in a second\r\ninstance; but, on the other hand, if it be preserved in the museum,\r\nthe individual is almost as permanent in this case, as the species\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed to notice another mode in which such information was\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_First Construction of Geological Maps._\r\n\r\nDR. LISTER, a learned physician, sent to the Royal Society, in 1683,\r\na proposal for maps of soils or minerals; in which he suggested that\r\nin the map of England, for example, each soil and its boundaries\r\nmight be distinguished by color, or in some other way. Such a mode\r\nof expressing and connecting our knowledge of the materials of the\r\nearth was, perhaps, obvious, when the mass of knowledge became\r\nconsiderable. In 1720, Fontenelle, in his observations on a paper of\r\nDe Reaumur's, which contained an account of a deposit of\r\nfossil-shells in Touraine, says, that in order to reason on such\r\ncases, \"we must have a kind of geographical charts, constructed\r\naccording to the collection of shells found in the earth.\" But he\r\njustly adds, \"What a quantity of observations, and what time would\r\nit not require to form such maps!\"\r\n\r\nThe execution of such projects required, not merely great labor, but\r\n{510} several steps in generalization and classification, before it\r\ncould take place. Still such attempts were made. In 1743, was\r\npublished, _A new Philosophico-chorographical Chart of East Kent,\r\ninvented and delineated_ by Christopher Packe, M.D.; in which,\r\nhowever, the main object is rather to express the course of the\r\nvalleys than the materials of the country. Guettard formed the\r\nproject of a mineralogical map of France, and Monnet carried this\r\nscheme into effect in 1780,[12\\18] \"by order of the king.\" In these\r\nmaps, however, the country is not considered as divided into soils,\r\nstill less strata; but each part is marked with its predominant\r\nmineral only. The spirit of generalization which constitutes the\r\nmain value of such a work is wanting.\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\18: _Atlas et Description Minéralogique de la France,\r\nentrepris par ordre du Roi_, par MM. Guettard et Monnet, Paris,\r\n1780, pp. 212, with 31 maps.]\r\n\r\nGeological maps belong strictly to Descriptive Geology; they are\r\nfree from those wide and doubtful speculations which form so large a\r\nportion of the earlier geological books. Yet even geological maps\r\ncannot be usefully or consistently constructed without considerable\r\nsteps of classification and generalization. When, in our own time,\r\ngeologists were become weary of controversies respecting theory,\r\nthey applied themselves with extraordinary zeal to the construction\r\nof stratigraphical maps of various countries; flattering themselves\r\nthat in this way they were merely recording incontestable facts and\r\ndifferences. Nor do I mean to intimate that their facts were\r\ndoubtful, or their distinctions arbitrary. But still they were facts\r\ninterpreted, associated, and represented, by means of the\r\nclassifications and general laws which earlier geologists had\r\nestablished; and thus even Descriptive Geology has been brought into\r\nexistence as a science by the formation of systems and the discovery\r\nof principles. At this we cannot be surprized, when we recollect the\r\nmany steps which the formation of Classificatory Botany required. We\r\nmust now notice some of the discoveries which tended to the\r\nformation of Systematic Descriptive Geology. {511}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIVE GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Discovery of the Order and Stratification of the\r\nMaterials of the Earth._\r\n\r\nTHAT the substances of which the earth is framed are not scattered\r\nand mixed at random, but possess identity and continuity to a\r\nconsiderable extent, Lister was aware, when he proposed his map. But\r\nthere is, in his suggestions, nothing relating to stratification;\r\nnor any order of position, still less of time, assigned to these\r\nmaterials. Woodward, however, appears to have been fully aware of\r\nthe general law of stratification. On collecting information from\r\nall parts, \"the result was,\" he says, \"that in time I was abundantly\r\nassured that the circumstances of these things in remoter countries\r\nwere much the same with those of ours here: that the stone, and\r\nother terrestrial matter in France, Flanders, Holland, Spain, Italy,\r\nGermany, Denmark, and Sweden, was distinguished into _strata or\r\nlayers_, as it is in England; that these strata were divided by\r\nparallel fissures; that there were enclosed in the stone and all the\r\nother denser kinds of terrestrial matter, great numbers of the\r\nshells, and other productions of the sea, in the same manner as in\r\nthat of this island.\"[13\\18] So remarkable a truth, thus collected\r\nfrom a copious collection of particulars by a patient induction, was\r\nan important step in the science.\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\18: _Natural History of the Earth_, 1723.]\r\n\r\nThese general facts now began to be commonly recognized, and followed\r\ninto detail. **Stukeley the antiquary[14\\18] (1724), remarked an\r\nimportant feature in the strata of England, that their _escarpments_,\r\nor steepest sides, are turned towards the west and north-west; and\r\nStrachey[15\\18] (1719), gave a stratigraphical description of certain\r\ncoal-mines near Bath.[16\\18] Michell, appointed Woodwardian Professor\r\nat Cambridge {512} in 1762, described this stratified structure of the\r\nearth far more distinctly than his predecessors, and pointed out, as\r\nthe consequence of it, that \"the same kinds of earths, stones, and\r\nminerals, will appear at the surface of the earth in long parallel\r\nslips, parallel to the long ridges of mountains; and so, in fact, we\r\nfind them.\"[17\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\18: _Itinerarium Curiosum_, 1724.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\18: _Phil. Trans._ 1719, and _Observations on Strata, &c._\r\n1729.]\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\18: Fitton, _Annals of Philosophy_, N. S. vol. i. and ii.\r\n(1832, '3), p.  157.]\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\18: _Phil. Trans._ 1760.]\r\n\r\nMichell (as appeared by papers of his which were examined after his\r\ndeath) had made himself acquainted with the series of English strata\r\nwhich thus occur from Cambridge to York;--that is, from the chalk to\r\nthe coal. These relations of position required that geological maps,\r\nto complete the information they conveyed, should be accompanied by\r\ngeological _Sections_, or imaginary representations of the order and\r\nmode of superpositions, as well as of the superficial extent of the\r\nstrata, as in more recent times has usually been done. The strata,\r\nas we travel from the higher to the lower, come from under each\r\nother into view; and this _out-cropping_, _basseting_, or by\r\nwhatever other term it is described, is an important feature in\r\ntheir description.\r\n\r\nIt was further noticed that these relations of position were\r\ncombined with other important facts, which irresistibly suggested\r\nthe notion of a relation in time. This, indeed, was implied in all\r\ntheories of the earth; but observations of the facts most require\r\nour notice. Steno is asserted by Humboldt[18\\18] to be the first who\r\n(in 1669) distinguished between rocks anterior to the existence of\r\nplants and animals upon the globe, containing therefore no organic\r\nremains; and rocks super-imposed on these, and full of such remains;\r\n\"turbidi maris sedimenta sibi invicem imposita\".\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\18: _Essai **Géognostique_.]\r\n\r\nRouelle is stated, by his pupil Desmarest, to have made some\r\nadditional and important observations. \"He saw,\" it is said, \"that\r\nthe shells which occur in rocks were not the same in all countries;\r\nthat certain species occur together, while others do not occur in\r\nthe same beds; that there is a constant order in the arrangement of\r\nthese shells, certain species lying in distinct bands.\"[19\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\18: _Encycl. Méthod. Geogr. Phys._ tom. i. p. 416, as\r\nquoted by Fitton as above, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nSuch divisions as these required to be marked by technical names. A\r\ndistinction was made of _l'ancienne terre_ and _la nouvelle terre_,\r\nto which Rouelle added a _travaille intermédiaire_. Rouelle died in\r\n1770, having been known by lectures, not by books. Lehman, in 1756,\r\nclaims for himself the credit of being the first to observe and\r\ndescribe correctly the structure of stratified countries; being\r\nignorant, {513} probably, of the labors of Strachey in England. He\r\ndivided mountains into three classes;[20\\18] _primitive_, which were\r\nformed with the world;--those which resulted from a partial\r\ndestruction of the primitive rocks;--and a third class resulting\r\nfrom local or universal deluges. In 1759, also, Arduine,[21\\18] in\r\nhis Memoirs on the mountains of Padua, Vicenza, and Verona, deduced,\r\nfrom original observations, the distinction of rocks into _primary_,\r\n_secondary_, and _tertiary_.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\18: Lyell, i. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\18: Ib. 72.]\r\n\r\nThe relations of position and fossils were, from this period,\r\ninseparably connected with opinions concerning succession in time.\r\nOdoardi remarked,[22\\18] that the strata of the **Sub-Apennine hills\r\nare _unconformable_ to those of the Apennine, (as Strachey had\r\nobserved, that the strata above the coal were unconformable to the\r\ncoal;[23\\18]) and his work contained a clear argument respecting the\r\ndifferent ages of these two classes of hills. Fuchsel was, in 1762,\r\naware of the distinctness of strata of different ages in Germany.\r\nPallas and Saussure were guided by general views of the same kind in\r\nobserving the countries which they visited: but, perhaps, the\r\ngeneral circulation of such notions was most due to Werner.\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\18: Ib. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\18: Fitton, p. 157.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Systematic form given to Descriptive Geology.--Werner._\r\n\r\nWERNER expressed the general relations of the strata of the earth by\r\nmeans of classifications which, so far as general applicability is\r\nconcerned, are extremely imperfect and arbitrary; he promulgated a\r\ntheory which almost entirely neglected all the facts previously\r\ndiscovered respecting the grouping of fossils,--which was founded\r\nupon observations made in a very limited district of Germany,--and\r\nwhich was contradicted even by the facts of this district. Yet the\r\nacuteness of his discrimination in the subjects which he studied,\r\nthe generality of the tenets he asserted, and the charm which he\r\nthrew about his speculations, gave to Geology, or, as he termed it,\r\n_Geognosy_, a popularity and reputation which it had never before\r\npossessed. His system had asserted certain universal formations,\r\nwhich followed each other in a constant order;--granite the\r\nlowest,--then mica-slate and clay-slate;--upon these _primitive_\r\nrocks, generally highly inclined, rest other _transition_\r\nstrata;--upon these, lie _secondary_ ones, which being more nearly\r\nhorizontal, are called _flötz_ or flat. The term _formation_, {514}\r\nwhich we have thus introduced, indicating groups which, by evidence\r\nof all kinds,--of their materials, their position, and their organic\r\ncontents,--are judged to belong to the same period, implies no small\r\namount of theory: yet this term, from this time forth, is to be\r\nlooked upon as a term of classification solely, so far as\r\nclassification can be separately attended to.\r\n\r\nWerner's distinctions of strata were for the most part drawn from\r\nmineralogical constitution. Doubtless, he could not fail to perceive\r\nthe great importance of organic fossils. \"I was witness,\" says M. de\r\nHumboldt, one of his most philosophical followers, \"of the lively\r\nsatisfaction which he felt when, in 1792, M. de **Schlottheim, one of\r\nthe most distinguished geologists of the school of Freiberg, began\r\nto make the relations of fossils to strata the principal object of\r\nhis studies.\" But Werner and the disciples of his school, even the\r\nmost enlightened of them, never employed the characters derived from\r\norganic remains with the same boldness and perseverance as those who\r\nhad from the first considered them as the leading phenomena: thus M.\r\nde Humboldt expresses doubts which perhaps many other geologists do\r\nnot feel when, in 1823, he says, \"Are we justified in concluding\r\nthat all formations are characterized by particular species? that\r\nthe fossil-shells of the chalk, the muschelkalk, the Jura limestone,\r\nand the Alpine limestone, are all different? I think this would be\r\npushing the induction much too far.\"[24\\18] In Prof. Jamieson's\r\n_Geognosy_, which may be taken as a representation of the Wernerian\r\ndoctrines, organic fossils are in no instance referred to as\r\ncharacters of formations or strata. After the curious and important\r\nevidence, contained in organic fossils, which had been brought into\r\nview by the labors of Italian, English, and German writers, the\r\npromulgation of a system of Descriptive Geology, in which all this\r\nevidence was neglected, cannot be considered otherwise than as a\r\nretrograde step in science.\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\18: _Gissement des Roches_, p. 41.]\r\n\r\nWerner maintained the aqueous deposition of all strata above the\r\nprimitive rocks; even of those _trap_ rocks, to which, from their\r\nresemblance to lava and other phenomena, Raspe, Arduino, and others,\r\nhad already assigned a volcanic origin. The fierce and long\r\ncontroversy between the _Vulcanists_ and _Neptunists_, which this\r\ndogma excited, does not belong to this part of our history; but the\r\ndiscovery of veins of granite penetrating the superincumbent slate,\r\nto which the controversy led, was an important event in descriptive\r\ngeology. Hutton, the {515} author of the theory of igneous causation\r\nwhich was in this country opposed to that of Werner, sought and\r\nfound this phenomenon in the Grampian hills, in 1785. This supposed\r\nverification of his system \"filled him with delight, and called\r\nforth such marks of joy and exultation, that the guides who\r\naccompanied him were persuaded, says his biographer,[25\\18] that he\r\nmust have discovered a vein of silver or gold.\"[26\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\18: Playfair's _Works_, vol. iv. p. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\18: Lyell, i. 90.]\r\n\r\nDesmarest's examination of Auvergne (1768) showed that there was\r\nthere an instance of a country which could not even be described\r\nwithout terms implying that the basalt, which covered so large a\r\nportion of it, had flowed from the craters of extinct volcanoes. His\r\nmap of Auvergne was an excellent example of a survey of such a\r\ncountry, thus exhibiting features quite different from those of\r\ncommon stratified countries.[27\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\18: Lyell, i. 86.]\r\n\r\nThe facts connected with metalliferous veins were also objects of\r\nWerner's attention. A knowledge of such facts is valuable to the\r\ngeologist as well as to the miner, although even yet much difficulty\r\nattends all attempts to theorize concerning them. The facts of this\r\nnature have been collected in great abundance in all mining\r\ndistricts; and form a prominent part of the descriptive geology of\r\nsuch districts; as, for example, the Hartz, and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nWithout further pursuing the history of the knowledge of the\r\ninorganic phenomena of the earth, I turn to a still richer\r\ndepartment of geology, which is concerned with organic fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Application of Organic Remains as a Geological\r\nCharacter.--Smith._\r\n\r\nROUELLE and Odoardi had perceived, as we have seen, that fossils\r\nwere grouped in bands: but from this general observation to the\r\nexecution of a survey of a large kingdom, founded upon this\r\nprinciple, would have been a vast stride, even if the author of it\r\nhad been aware of the doctrines thus asserted by these writers. In\r\nfact, however, William Smith executed such a survey of England, with\r\nno other guide or help than his own sagacity and perseverance. In\r\nhis employments as a civil engineer, he noticed the remarkable\r\ncontinuity and constant order of the strata in the neighborhood of\r\nBath, as discriminated by their fossils; and about the year 1793,\r\nhe[28\\18] drew up a Tabular View of the {516} strata of that\r\ndistrict, which contained the germ of his subsequent discoveries.\r\nFinding in the north of England the same strata and associations of\r\nstrata with which he had become acquainted in the west, he was led\r\nto name them and to represent them by means of maps, according to\r\ntheir occurrence over the whole face of England. These maps\r\nappeared[29\\18] in 1815; and a work by the same author, entitled\r\n_The English Strata identified by Organic Remains_, came forth\r\nlater. But the views on which this identification of strata rests,\r\nbelong to a considerably earlier date; and had not only been acted\r\nupon, but freely imparted in conversation many years before.\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\18: Fitton, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\18: Brit. Assoc. 1832. Conybeare, p. 373.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the study of fossils was pursued with zeal in\r\nvarious countries. Lamarck and Defrance employed themselves in\r\ndetermining the fossil shells of the neighborhood of Paris;[30\\18]\r\nand the interest inspired by this subject was strongly nourished and\r\nstimulated by the memorable work of Cuvier and Brongniart, _On the\r\nEnvirons of Paris_, published in 1811, and by Cuvier's subsequent\r\nresearches on the subjects thus brought under notice. For now, not\r\nonly the distinction, succession, and arrangement, but many other\r\nrelations among fossil strata, irresistibly arrested the attention\r\nof the philosopher. Brongniart[31\\18] showed that very striking\r\nresemblances occurred in their fossil remains, between certain\r\nstrata of Europe and of North America; and proved that a rock may be\r\nso much disguised, that the identity of the stratum can only be\r\nrecognized by geological characters.[32\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\18: Humboldt, _Giss. d. R._ p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\18: _Hist. Nat. des Crustacés Fossiles_, pp. 57, 62.]\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\18: Humboldt, _Giss. d. R._ p. 45.]\r\n\r\nThe Italian geologists had found in their hills, for the most part,\r\nthe same species of shells which existed in their seas; but the\r\nGerman and English writers, as Gesner,[33\\18] Raspe,[34\\18] and\r\nBrander,[35\\18] had perceived that the fossil-shells were either of\r\nunknown species, or of such as lived in distant latitudes. To decide\r\nthat the animals and plants, of which we find the remains in a\r\nfossil state, were of species now extinct, obviously required an\r\nexact and extensive knowledge of natural history. And if this were\r\nso, to assign the relations of the past to the existing tribes of\r\nbeings, and the peculiarities of their vital processes and habits,\r\nwere tasks which could not be performed without the most consummate\r\nphysiological skill and talent. Such tasks, however, have been the\r\nfamiliar employments of geologists, and naturalists incited and\r\n{517} appealed to by geologists, ever since Cuvier published his\r\nexamination of the fossil inhabitants of the Paris basin. Without\r\nattempting a history of such labors, I may notice a few\r\ncircumstances connected with them.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\18: Lyell, i. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\18: Ib. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\18: Ib. 76.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Advances in Palæontology.--Cuvier._\r\n\r\nSO long as the organic fossils which were found in the strata of the\r\nearth were the remains of marine animals, it was very difficult for\r\ngeologists to be assured that the animals were such as did not exist\r\nin any part or clime of the existing ocean. But when large land and\r\nriver animals were discovered, different from any known species, the\r\npersuasion that they were of extinct races was forced upon the\r\nnaturalist. Yet this opinion was not taken up slightly, nor\r\nacquiesced in without many struggles.\r\n\r\nBones supposed to belong to fossil elephants, were some of the first\r\nwith regard to which this conclusion was established. Such remains\r\noccur in vast numbers in the soil and gravel of almost every part of\r\nthe world; especially in Siberia, where they are called the bones of\r\nthe _mammoth_. They had been noticed by the ancients, as we learn\r\nfrom Pliny;[36\\18] and had been ascribed to human giants, to\r\nelephants imported by the Romans, and to many other origins. But in\r\n1796, Cuvier had examined these opinions with a more profound\r\nknowledge than his predecessors; and he thus stated the result of\r\nhis researches.[37\\18] \"With regard to what have been called the\r\nfossil remains of elephants, from Tentzelius to Pallas, I believe\r\nthat I am in the condition to prove, that they belong to animals\r\nwhich were very clearly different in species from our existing\r\nelephants, although they resembled them sufficiently to be\r\nconsidered as belonging to the same genera.\" He had founded this\r\nconclusion principally on the structure of the teeth, which he found\r\nto differ in the Asiatic and African elephant; while, in the fossil\r\nanimal, it was different from both. But he also reasoned in part on\r\nthe form of the skull, of which the best-known example had been\r\ndescribed in the _Philosophical Transactions_ as early as\r\n1737.[38\\18] \"As soon,\" says Cuvier, at a later period, \"as I became\r\nacquainted with Messerschmidt's drawing, and joined to the\r\ndifferences which it presented, those which I had myself observed in\r\nthe inferior jaw and the {518} molar teeth, I no longer doubted that\r\nthe fossil elephants were of a species different from the Indian\r\nelephant. This idea, which I announced to the Institute in the month\r\nof January, 1796, opened to me views entirely new respecting the\r\ntheory of the earth; and determined me to devote myself to the long\r\nresearches and to the assiduous labors which have now occupied me\r\nfor twenty-five years.\"[39\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\18: _Hist. Nat._ lib. xxxvi. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\18: _Mém. Inst. Math. et Phys._ tom. ii. p. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\18: Described by Breyne from a specimen found in Siberia by\r\nMesserschmidt in 1722. _Phil. Trans._ xl. 446.]\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\18: _Ossemens Fossiles_, second edit. i. 178.]\r\n\r\nWe have here, then, the starting-point of those researches\r\nconcerning extinct animals, which, ever since that time, have\r\nattracted so large a share of notice from geologists and from the\r\nworld. Cuvier could hardly have anticipated the vast storehouse of\r\nmaterials which lay under his feet, ready to supply him occupation\r\nof the most intense interest in the career on which he had thus\r\nentered. The examination of the strata on which Paris stands, and of\r\nwhich its buildings consist, supplied him with animals, not only\r\ndifferent from existing ones, but some of them of great size and\r\ncurious peculiarities. A careful examination of the remains which\r\nthese strata contain was undertaken soon after the period we have\r\nreferred to. In 1802, Defrance had collected several hundreds of\r\nundescribed species of shells; and Lamarck[40\\18] began a series of\r\nMemoirs upon them; remodelling the whole of Conchology, in order\r\nthat they might be included in its classifications. And two years\r\nafterwards (1804) appears the first of Cuvier's grand series of\r\nMemoirs containing the restoration of the vertebrate animals of\r\nthese strata. In this vast natural museum, and in contributions from\r\nother parts of the globe, he discovered the most extraordinary\r\ncreatures:--the Palæotherium,[41\\18] which is intermediate between\r\nthe horse and the pig; the Anoplotherium, which stands nearest to\r\nthe rhinoceros and the tapir; the Megalonix and Megatherium, animals\r\nof the sloth tribe, but of the size of the ox and the rhinoceros.\r\nThe Memoirs which contained these and many other discoveries, set\r\nthe naturalists to work in every part of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\18:  _Annales du Muséum d'Hist. Nat._ tom. i. p. 308, and\r\nthe following volumes.]\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\18: Daubuisson, ii. 411.]\r\n\r\nAnother very curious class of animals was brought to light\r\nprincipally by the geologists of England; animals of which the\r\nbones, found in the _lias_ stratum, were at first supposed to be\r\nthose of crocodiles. But in 1816,[42\\18] Sir Everard Home says, \"In\r\ntruth, on a consideration of this skeleton, we cannot but be\r\ninclined to believe, that among the animals destroyed by the\r\ncatastrophes of remote antiquity, there had {519} been some at least\r\nthat differ so entirely in their structure from any which now exist\r\nas to make it impossible to arrange their fossil remains with any\r\nknown class of animals.\" The animal thus referred to, being clearly\r\nintermediate between fishes and lizards, was named by Mr. König,\r\n_Ichthyosaurus_; and its structure and constitution were more\r\nprecisely determined by Mr. Conybeare in 1821, when he had occasion\r\nto compare with it another extinct animal of which he and Mr. de la\r\nBeche had collected the remains. This animal, still more nearly\r\napproaching the lizard tribe, was by Mr. Conybeare called\r\n_Plesiosaurus_.[43\\18] Of each of these two genera several species\r\nwere afterwards found.\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\18: _Phil. Trans._ 1816, p. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\18: _Geol. Trans._ vol. v.]\r\n\r\nBefore this time, the differences of the races of animals and plants\r\nbelonging to the past and the present periods of the earth's\r\nhistory, had become a leading subject of speculation among\r\ngeological naturalists. The science produced by this study of the\r\nnatural history of former states of the earth has been termed\r\n_Palæontology_; and there is no branch of human knowledge more\r\nfitted to stir men's wonder, or to excite them to the widest\r\nphysiological speculations. But in the present part of our history\r\nthis science requires our notice, only so far as it aims at the\r\nrestoration of the types of ancient animals, on clear and undoubted\r\nprinciples of comparative anatomy. To show how extensive and how\r\nconclusive is the science when thus directed, we need only refer to\r\nCuvier's _Ossemens Fossiles_;[44\\18] a work of vast labor and\r\nprofound knowledge, which has opened wide the doors of this part of\r\ngeology. I do not here attempt even to mention the labors of the\r\nmany other eminent contributors to Palæontology; as Brocchi, Des\r\nHayes, Sowerby, Goldfuss, Agassiz, who have employed themselves on\r\nanimals, and Schlottheim, Brongniart, Hutton, Lindley, on plants.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\18: The first edition appeared in 1812, consisting\r\nprincipally of the Memoirs to which reference has already been made.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Among the many valuable contributions to Palæontology in\r\nmore recent times, I may especially mention Mr. Owen's _Reports on\r\nBritish Fossil Reptiles_, _on British Fossil Mammalia_, and _on the\r\nExtinct Animals of Australia_, with descriptions of certain Fossils\r\nindicative of large Marsupial Pachydermata: and M. Agassiz's _Report\r\non the Fossil Fishes of the Devonian System_, his _Synoptical Table\r\nof British Fossil Fishes_, and his _Report on the Fishes of the\r\nLondon Clay_. All these are contained in the volumes produced by the\r\nBritish Association from 1839 to 1845. {520}\r\n\r\nA new and most important instrument of palæontological investigation\r\nhas been put in the geologist's hand by Prof. Owen's discovery, that\r\nthe internal structure of teeth, as disclosed by the microscope, is\r\na means of determining the kind of the animal. He has carried into\r\nevery part of the animal kingdom an examination founded upon this\r\ndiscovery, and has published the results of this in his\r\n_Odontography_. As an example of the application of this character\r\nof animals, I may mention that a tooth brought from Riga by Sir R.\r\nMurchison was in this way ascertained by Mr. Owen to belong to a\r\nfish of the genus _Dendrodus_. (_Geology of Russia_, i. 67.)]\r\n\r\nWhen it had thus been established, that the strata of the earth are\r\ncharacterized by innumerable remains of the organized beings which\r\nformerly inhabited it, and that anatomical and physiological\r\nconsiderations must be carefully and skilfully applied in order\r\nrightly to interpret these characters, the geologist and the\r\npalæontologist obviously had, brought before them, many very wide\r\nand striking questions. Of these we may give some instances; but, in\r\nthe first place, we may add a few words concerning those eminent\r\nphilosophers to whom the science owed the basis on which succeeding\r\nspeculations were to be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Intellectual Characters of the Founders of Systematic\r\nDescriptive Geology._\r\n\r\nIT would be in accordance with the course we have pursued in\r\ntreating of other subjects, that we should attempt to point out in\r\nthe founders of the science now under consideration, those\r\nintellectual qualities and habits to which we ascribe their success.\r\nThe very recent date of the generalizations of geology, which has\r\nhardly allowed us time to distinguish the calm expression of the\r\nopinion of the wisest judges, might, in this instance, relieve us\r\nfrom such a duty; but since our plan appears to suggest it, we will,\r\nat least, endeavor to mark the characters of the founders of\r\ngeology, by a few of their prominent lines.\r\n\r\nThe three persons who must be looked upon as the main authors of\r\ngeological classification are, Werner, Smith, and Cuvier. These\r\nthree men were of very different mental constitution; and it will,\r\nperhaps, not be difficult to compare them, in reference to those\r\nqualities which we have all along represented as the main features\r\nof the discoverer's genius, clearness of ideas, the possession of\r\nnumerous facts, and the power of bringing these two elements into\r\ncontact. {521}\r\n\r\nIn the German, considering him as a geologist, the ideal element\r\npredominated. That Werner's powers of external discrimination were\r\nextremely acute, we have seen in speaking of him as a mineralogist;\r\nand his talent and tendency for classifying were, in his\r\nmineralogical studies, fully fed by an abundant store of\r\nobservation; but when he came to apply this methodizing power to\r\ngeology, the love of system, so fostered, appears to have been too\r\nstrong for the collection of facts he had to deal with. As we have\r\nalready said, he promulgated, as representing the world, a scheme\r\ncollected from a province, and even too hastily gathered from that\r\nnarrow field. Yet his intense spirit of method in some measure\r\ncompensated for other deficiencies, and enabled him to give the\r\ncharacter of a science to what had been before a collection of\r\nmiscellaneous phenomena. The ardor of system-making produced a sort\r\nof fusion, which, however superficial, served to bind together the\r\nmass of incoherent and mixed materials, and thus to form, though by\r\nstrange and anomalous means, a structure of no small strength and\r\ndurability, like the ancient vitrified structures which we find in\r\nsome of our mountain regions.\r\n\r\nOf a very different temper and character was William Smith. No\r\nliterary cultivation of his youth awoke in him the speculative love\r\nof symmetry and system; but a singular clearness and precision of\r\nthe classifying power, which he possessed as a native talent, was\r\nexercised and developed by exactly those geological facts among\r\nwhich his philosophical task lay. Some of the advances which he\r\nmade, had, as we have seen, been at least entered upon by others who\r\npreceded him: but of all this he was ignorant; and, perhaps, went on\r\nmore steadily and eagerly to work out his own ideas, from the\r\npersuasion that they were entirely his own. At a later period of his\r\nlife, he himself published an account of the views which had\r\nanimated him in his earlier progress. In this account[45\\18] he\r\ndates his attempts to discriminate and connect strata from the year\r\n1790, at which time he was twenty years old. In 1792, he \"had\r\nconsidered how he could best represent the order of\r\nsuperposition--continuity of course--and general eastern declination\r\nof the strata.\" Soon after, doubts which had arisen were removed by\r\nthe \"discovery of a mode of identifying the strata by the organized\r\nfossils respectively imbedded therein.\" And \"thus stored with\r\nideas,\" as he expresses himself, he began to communicate them to his\r\nfriends. In all this, we see great vividness {522} of thought and\r\nactivity of mind, unfolding itself exactly in proportion to the\r\nfacts with which it had to deal. We are reminded of that cyclopean\r\narchitecture in which each stone, as it occurs, is, with wonderful\r\ningenuity, and with the least possible alteration of its form,\r\nshaped so as to fit its place in a solid and lasting edifice.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\18: _Phil. Mag._ 1833, vol. i. p. 38.]\r\n\r\nDifferent yet again was the character (as a geological discoverer)\r\nof the great naturalist of the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\nIn that part of his labors of which we have now to speak, Cuvier's\r\ndominant ideas were rather physiological than geological. In his\r\nviews of past physical changes, he did not seek to include any\r\nranges of facts which lay much beyond the narrow field of the Paris\r\nbasin. But his sagacity in applying his own great principle of the\r\nConditions of Existence, gave him a peculiar and unparalleled power\r\nin interpreting the most imperfect fossil records of extinct\r\nanatomy. In the constitution of his mind, all philosophical\r\nendowments were so admirably developed and disciplined, that it was\r\ndifficult to say, whether more of his power was due to genius or to\r\nculture. The talent of classifying which he exercised in geology,\r\nwas the result of the most complete knowledge and skill in zoology;\r\nwhile his views concerning the revolutions which had taken place in\r\nthe organic and inorganic world, were in no small degree aided by an\r\nextraordinary command of historical and other literature. His\r\nguiding ideas had been formed, his facts had been studied, by the\r\nassistance of all the sciences which could be made to bear upon\r\nthem. In his geological labors we seem to see some beautiful temple,\r\nnot only firm and fair in itself, but decorated with sculpture and\r\npainting, and rich in all that art and labor, memory and\r\nimagination, can contribute to its beauty.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Sir Charles Lyell (B. i. c. iv.) has quoted with approval\r\nwhat I have elsewhere said, that the advancement of three of the\r\nmain divisions of geology in the beginning of the present century\r\nwas promoted principally by the three great nations of Europe,--the\r\nGerman, the English, and the French:--Mineralogical Geology by the\r\nGerman school of Werner:--Secondary Geology by Smith and his English\r\nsuccessors;--Tertiary Geology by Cuvier and his fellow-laborers in\r\nFrance.] {523}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE FORMATION OF SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIVE GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Reception and Diffusion of Systematic Geology._\r\n\r\nIF our nearness to the time of the discoveries to which we have just\r\nreferred, embarrasses us in speaking of their authors, it makes it\r\nstill more difficult to narrate the reception with which these\r\ndiscoveries met. Yet here we may notice a few facts which may not be\r\nwithout their interest.\r\n\r\nThe impression which Werner made upon his hearers was very strong;\r\nand, as we have already said, disciples were gathered to his school\r\nfrom every country, and then went forward into all parts of the\r\nworld, animated by the views which they had caught from him. We may\r\nsay of him, as has been so wisely said of a philosopher of a very\r\ndifferent kind,[46\\18] \"He owed his influence to various causes; at\r\nthe head of which may be placed that genius for system, which,\r\nthough it cramps the growth of knowledge, perhaps finally atones for\r\nthat mischief by the zeal and activity which it rouses among\r\nfollowers and opponents, who discover truth by accident, when in\r\npursuit of weapons for their warfare.\" The list of Werner's pupils\r\nfor a considerable period included most of the principal geologists\r\nof Europe; Freisleben, Mohs, Esmark, d'Andrada, Raumer, Engelhart,\r\nCharpentier, Brocchi. Alexander von Humboldt and Leopold von Buch\r\nwent forth from his school to observe America and Siberia, the Isles\r\nof the Atlantic, and the coast of Norway. Professor Jameson\r\nestablished at Edinburgh a Wernerian Society; and his lecture-room\r\nbecame a second centre of Wernerian doctrines, whence proceeded many\r\nzealous geological observers; among these we may mention as one of\r\nthe most distinguished, M. Ami Boué, though, like several others, he\r\nsoon cast away the peculiar opinions of the Wernerian school. The\r\nclassifications of this school were, however, diffused over the\r\ncivilized world with {524} extraordinary success; and were looked\r\nupon with great respect, till the study of organic fossils threw\r\nthem into the shade.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\18: Mackintosh _on Hobbes_, Dissert. p. 177.]\r\n\r\nSmith, on the other hand, long pursued his own thoughts without aid\r\nand without sympathy. About 1799 he became acquainted with a few\r\ngentlemen (Dr. Anderson, Mr. Richardson, Mr. Townsend, and Mr.\r\nDavies), who had already given some attention to organic fossils,\r\nand who were astonished to find his knowledge so much more exact and\r\nextensive than their own. From this time he conceived the intention\r\nof publishing his discoveries; but the want of literary leisure and\r\nhabits long prevented him. His knowledge was orally communicated\r\nwithout reserve to many persons; and thus gradually and insensibly\r\nbecame part of the public stock. When this diffusion of his views\r\nhad gone on for some time, his friends began to complain that the\r\nauthor of them was deprived of his well-merited share of fame. His\r\ndelay in publication made it difficult to remedy this wrong; for\r\nsoon after he published his Geological Map of England, another\r\nappeared, founded upon separate observations; and though, perhaps,\r\nnot quite independent of his, yet in many respects much more\r\ndetailed and correct. Thus, though his general ideas obtained\r\nuniversal currency, he did not assume his due prominence as a\r\ngeologist. In 1818, a generous attempt was made to direct a proper\r\ndegree of public gratitude to him, in an article in the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, the production of Dr. Fitton, a distinguished English\r\ngeologist. And when the eminent philosopher, Wollaston, had\r\nbequeathed to the Geological Society of London a fund from which a\r\ngold medal was to be awarded to geological services, the first of\r\nsuch medals was, in 1831, \"given to Mr. William Smith, in\r\nconsideration of his being a great original discoverer in English\r\ngeology; and especially for his having been the first in this\r\ncountry to discover and to teach the identification of strata, and\r\nto determine their succession by means of their imbedded fossils.\"\r\n\r\nCuvier's discoveries, on the other hand, both from the high\r\nphilosophic fame of their author, and from their intrinsic\r\nimportance, arrested at once the attention of scientific Europe;\r\nand, notwithstanding the undoubted priority of Smith's labors, for a\r\nlong time were looked upon as the starting-point of our knowledge of\r\norganic fossils. And, in reality, although Cuvier's memoirs derived\r\nthe greatest part of their value from his zoological conclusions,\r\nthey reflected back no small portion of interest on the\r\nclassifications of strata which were involved in his inferences. And\r\nthe views which he presented gave to geology an attractive and\r\nstriking character, and a connexion with {525} large physiological\r\nas well as physical principles, which added incomparably to its\r\ndignity and charm.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the reception and diffusion of doctrines such as those of\r\nSmith and Cuvier, we ought not to omit to notice more especially the\r\nformation and history of the Geological Society of London, just\r\nmentioned. It was established in 1807, with a view to multiply and\r\nrecord observations, and patiently to await the result of some\r\nfuture period; that is, its founders resolved to apply themselves to\r\nDescriptive Geology, thinking the time not come for that theoretical\r\ngeology which had then long fired the controversial ardor of\r\nNeptunists and Plutonists. The first volume of the Transactions of\r\nthis society was published in 1811. The greater part of the contents\r\nof this volume[47\\18] savor of the notions of the Wernerian school;\r\nand there are papers on some of the districts in England most rich\r\nin fossils, which Mr. Conybeare says, well exhibit the low state of\r\nsecondary geology at that period. But a paper by Mr. Parkinson\r\nrefers to the discoveries both of Smith and of Cuvier; and in the\r\nnext volume, Mr. Webster gives an account of the Isle of Wight,\r\nfollowing the admirable model of Cuvier and Brongniart's account of\r\nthe Paris basin. \"If we compare this memoir of Mr. Webster with the\r\npreceding one of Dr. Berger (also of the Isle of Wight), they at\r\nonce show themselves to belong to two very distinct eras of science;\r\nand it is difficult to believe that the interval which elapsed\r\nbetween their respective publication was only three or four\r\nyears.\"[48\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\18: Conybeare, _Report. Brit. Assoc._ p. 372.]\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\18: Conybeare, _Report_, p. 372.]\r\n\r\nAmong the events belonging to the diffusion of sound geological\r\nviews in this country, we may notice the publication of a little\r\nvolume entitled, _The Geology of England and Wales_, by Mr.\r\nConybeare and Mr. Phillips, in 1821; an event far more important\r\nthan, from the modest form and character of the work, it might at\r\nfirst sight appear. By describing in detail the geological structure\r\nand circumstances of England (at least as far downwards as the\r\ncoal), it enabled a very wide class of readers to understand and\r\nverify the classifications which geology had then very recently\r\nestablished; while the extensive knowledge and philosophical spirit\r\nof Mr. Conybeare rendered it, under the guise of a topographical\r\nenumeration, in reality a profound and instructive scientific\r\ntreatise. The vast impulse which it gave to the study of sound\r\ndescriptive geology was felt and acknowledged in other countries, as\r\nwell as in Britain. {526}\r\n\r\nSince that period, Descriptive Geology in England has constantly\r\nadvanced. The advance has been due mainly to the labors of the members\r\nof the Geological Society; on whose merits as cultivators of their\r\nscience, none but those who are themselves masters of the subject,\r\nhave a right to dwell. Yet some parts of the scientific character of\r\nthese men may be appreciated by the general speculator; for they have\r\nshown that there are no talents and no endowments which may not find\r\ntheir fitting employment in this science. Besides that they have\r\nunited laborious research and comprehensive views, acuteness and\r\nlearning, zeal and knowledge; the philosophical eloquence with which\r\nthey have conducted their discussions has had a most beneficial\r\ninfluence on the tone of their speculations; and their researches in\r\nthe field, which have carried them into every country and every class\r\nof society, have given them that prompt and liberal spirit, and that\r\nopen and cordial bearing, which results from intercourse with the\r\nworld on a large and unfettered scale. It is not too much to say, that\r\nin our time, Practical Geology has been one of the best schools of\r\nphilosophical and general culture of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Application of Systematic Geology. Geological Surveys\r\nand Maps._\r\n\r\nSUCH surveys as that which Conybeare and Phillips's book presented\r\nwith respect to England, were not only a means of disseminating the\r\nknowledge implied in the classifications of such a work, but they\r\nwere also an essential part of the Application and Extension of the\r\nprinciples established by the founders of Systematic Geology. As\r\nsoon as the truth of such a system was generally acknowledged, the\r\npersuasion of the propriety of geological surveys and maps of each\r\ncountry could not but impress itself on men's minds.\r\n\r\nWhen the earlier writers, as Lister and Fontenelle, spoke of\r\nmineralogical and fossilological maps, they could hardly be said to\r\nknow the meaning of the terms which they thus used. But when\r\nsubsequent classifications had shown how such a suggestion might be\r\ncarried into effect, and to what important consequences it might\r\nlead, the task was undertaken in various countries in a vigorous and\r\nconsistent manner. In England, besides Smith's map, another, drawn\r\nup by Mr. Greenough, was published by the Geological Society in\r\n1819; and, being founded on very numerous observations of the author\r\nand his friends, made with great labor and cost, was not only an\r\nimportant {527} correction and confirmation of Smith's labors, but a\r\nvaluable storehouse and standard of what had then been done in\r\nEnglish geology. Leopold von Buch had constructed a geological map\r\nof a large portion of Germany, about the same period; but, aware of\r\nthe difficulty of the task he had thus attempted, he still forbore\r\nto publish it. At a later period, and as materials accumulated, more\r\ndetailed maps of parts of Germany were produced by Hoffmann and\r\nothers. The French government entrusted to a distinguished Professor\r\nof the School of Mines (M. Brochant de Villiers), the task of\r\nconstructing a map of France on the model of Mr. Greenough's;\r\nassociating with him two younger persons, selected for their energy\r\nand talents, MM. Beaumont and Dufrénoy. We shall have occasion\r\nhereafter to speak of the execution of this survey. By various\r\npersons, geological maps of almost every country and province of\r\nEurope, and of many parts of Asia and America, have been published.\r\nI need not enumerate these, but I may refer to the account given of\r\nthem by Mr. Conybeare, in the _Reports of the British Association\r\nfor_ 1832, p. 384. These various essays may be considered as\r\ncontributions, though hitherto undoubtedly very imperfect ones, to\r\nthat at which Descriptive Geology ought to aim, and which is\r\nrequisite as a foundation for sound theory;--a complete geological\r\nsurvey of the whole earth. But we must say a few words respecting\r\nthe language in which such a survey must be written.\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, that condition which made such maps and the\r\naccompanying descriptions possible, was that the strata and their\r\ncontents had previously undergone classification and arrangement at\r\nthe hands of the fathers of geology. Classification, in this as in\r\nother cases, implied names which should give to the classes\r\ndistinctness and permanence; and when the series of strata belonging\r\nto one country were referred to in the description of another, in\r\nwhich they appeared, as was usually the case, under an aspect at\r\nleast somewhat different, the supposed identification required a\r\npeculiar study of each case; and thus Geology had arrived at the\r\npoint, which we have before had to notice as one of the stages of\r\nthe progress of Classificatory Botany, at which a technical\r\n_nomenclature_ and a well-understood _synonymy_ were essential parts\r\nof the science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Geological Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nBY Nomenclature we mean a _system_ of names; and hence we can {528}\r\nnot speak of a Geological Nomenclature till we come to Werner and\r\nSmith. The earlier mineralogists had employed names, often\r\nartificial and arbitrary, for special minerals, but no technical and\r\nconstant names for strata. The elements of Werner's names for the\r\nmembers of his geological series were words in use among miners, as\r\n_Gneiss_, _Grauwacke_, _Thonschiefer_, _Rothe todte liegende_,\r\n_Zechstein_; or arbitrary names of the mineralogists, as Syenite,\r\nSerpentine, Porphyry, Granite. But the more technical part of his\r\nphraseology was taken from that which is the worst kind of name,\r\narbitrary numeration. Thus he had his _first_ sandstone formation,\r\n_second_ sandstone, _third_ sandstone; _first_ flötz limestone,\r\n_second_ flötz limestone, _third_ flötz limestone. Such names are,\r\nbeyond all others, liable to mistake in their application, and\r\nlikely to be expelled by the progress of knowledge; and accordingly,\r\nthough the Wernerian names for rocks mineralogically distinguished,\r\nhave still some currency, his sandstones and limestones, after\r\ncreating endless confusion while his authority had any sway, have\r\nutterly disappeared from good geological works.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of Smith was founded upon English provincial terms\r\nof very barbarous aspect, as _Cornbrash_, _Lias_, _Gault_, _Clunch\r\nClay_, _Coral Rag_. Yet these terms were widely diffused when his\r\nclassification was generally accepted; they kept their place,\r\nprecisely because they had no systematic signification; and many of\r\nthem are at present part of the geological language of the whole\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of names which has been very prevalent among geologists\r\nare those borrowed from places. Thus the Wernerians spoke of Alpine\r\nLimestone and Jura Limestone; the English, of Kimmeridge Clay and\r\nOxford Clay, Purbeck Marble, and Portland Rock. These names,\r\nreferring to the stratum of a known locality as a type, were good,\r\nas far as an identity with that type had been traced; but when this\r\nhad been incompletely done, they were liable to great ambiguity. If\r\nthe Alps or the Jura contain several formations of limestone, such\r\nterms as we have noticed, borrowed from those mountains, cease to be\r\nnecessarily definite, and may give rise to much confusion.\r\n\r\nDescriptive names, although they might be supposed to be the best,\r\nhave, in fact, rarely been fortunate. The reason of this is\r\nobvious;--the mark which has been selected for description may\r\neasily fail to be essential; and the obvious connexions of natural\r\nfacts may overleap the arbitrary definition. As we have already\r\nstated in the history of botany, the establishment of descriptive\r\nmarks of real classes presupposes the important but difficult step,\r\nof the discovery of such marks. {529} Hence those descriptive names\r\nonly have been really useful in geology which had been used without\r\nany scrupulous regard to the appropriateness of the description. The\r\n_Green Sand_ may be white, brown, or red; the _Mountain Limestone_\r\nmay occur only in valleys; the _Oolite_ may have no roe-like\r\nstructure; and yet these may be excellent geological names, if they\r\nbe applied to formations geologically identical with those which the\r\nphrases originally designated. The signification may assist the\r\nmemory, but must not be allowed to subjugate the faculty of natural\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nThe terms which have been formed by geologists in recent times have\r\nbeen drawn from sources similar to those of the older ones, and will\r\nhave their fortune determined by the same conditions. Thus Mr. Lyell\r\nhas given to the divisions of the tertiary strata the appellations\r\n_Pleiocene_, _Meiocene_, _Eocene_, accordingly as they contain a\r\n_majority_ of recent species of shells, a _minority_ of such\r\nspecies, or a small proportion of living species, which may be\r\nlooked upon as indicating the _dawn_ of the existing state of the\r\nanimate creation. But in this case, he wisely treats his\r\ndistinctions, not as definitions, but as the marks of natural\r\ngroups. \"The plurality of species indicated by the name _pleiocene_\r\nmust not,\" he says,[49\\18] \"be understood to imply an absolute\r\nmajority of recent fossil shells in all cases, but a comparative\r\npreponderance wherever the pleiocene are contrasted with strata of\r\nthe period immediately preceding.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\18: _Geol._ iii. 392.]\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell might have added, that no precise percentage of recent\r\nspecies, nor any numerical criterion whatever, can be allowed to\r\noverbear the closer natural relations of strata, proved by evidence\r\nof a superior kind, if such can be found. And this would be the\r\nproper answer to the objection made by De la Beche to these names;\r\nnamely, that it may happen that the _meiocene_ rocks of one country\r\nmay be of the same date as the _pleiocene_ of another; the same\r\nformation having in one place a majority, in another a minority, of\r\nexisting species. We are not to run into this incongruity, for we\r\nare not so to apply the names. The formation which has been called\r\npleiocene, must continue to be so called, even where the majority of\r\nrecent species fails; and all rocks that agree with that in date,\r\nwithout further reference to the numerical relations of their\r\nfossils, must also share in the name.\r\n\r\nTo invent good names for these large divisions of the series of\r\nstrata is indeed extremely difficult. The term _Oolite_ is an\r\ninstance in which {530} a descriptive word has become permanent in a\r\ncase of this kind; and, in imitation of it, _Pœcilite_ (from\r\nποικίλος, various,**) has been proposed by Mr. Conybeare[50\\18] as\r\na name for the group of strata inferior to the oolites, of which the\r\n_Variegated_ Sandstone (Bunter Sandstein, Grès Bigarré,) is a\r\nconspicuous member. For the series of formations which lies\r\nimmediately over the rocks in which no organic remains are found,\r\nthe term _Transition_ was long used, but with extreme ambiguity and\r\nvagueness. When this series, or rather the upper part of it, was\r\nwell examined in South Wales, where it consists of many well-marked\r\nmembers, and may be probably taken as a type for a large portion of\r\nthe rest of the world, it became necessary to give to the group thus\r\nexplored a name not necessarily leading to assumption or\r\ncontroversy. Mr. Murchison selected the term _Silurian_, borrowed\r\nfrom the former inhabitants of the country in which his types were\r\nfound; and this is a term excellent in many respects; but one which\r\nwill probably not quite supersede \"Transition,\" because, in other\r\nplaces, transition rocks occur which correspond to none of the\r\nmembers of the Silurian region.\r\n\r\n[Note 50\\18: _Report_, p. 379.]\r\n\r\nThough new names are inevitable accompaniments of new views of\r\nclassification, and though, therefore, the geological discoverer\r\nmust be allowed a right to coin them, this is a privilege which, for\r\nthe sake of his own credit, and the circulation of his tokens, he\r\nmust exercise with great temperance and judgment. M. Brongniart may\r\nbe taken as an example of the neglect of this caution. Acting upon\r\nthe principle, in itself a sound one, that inconveniences arise from\r\ngeological terms which have a mineralogical signification, he has\r\ngiven an entirely new list of names of the members of the geological\r\nseries. Thus the primitive unstratified rocks are _terrains\r\nagalysiens_; the transition semi-compact are _hemilysiens_; the\r\nsedimentary strata are _yzemiens_; the diluvial deposits are\r\n_clysmiens_; and these divisions are subdivided by designations\r\nequally novel; thus of the \"terrains yzemiens,\" members are--the\r\nterrains _clastiques_, _tritoniens_, _protéïques_, _palæotheriens_,\r\n_epilymniques_, _thalassiques_.[51\\18] Such a nomenclature appears\r\nto labor under great inconveniences, since the terms are descriptive\r\nin their derivation, yet are not generally intelligible, and refer\r\nto theoretical views yet have not the recommendation of systematic\r\nconnexion. {531}\r\n\r\n[Note 51\\18: Brongniart, _Tableau des Terrains_, 1829.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Geological Synonymy, or Determination of Geological\r\nEquivalents._\r\n\r\nIT will easily be supposed that with so many different sources of\r\nnames as we have mentioned, the same stratum may be called by\r\ndifferent designations; and thus a synonymy may be necessary for\r\ngeology; as it was for botany in the time of Bauhin, when the same\r\nplants had been spoken of by so many different appellations in\r\ndifferent authors. But in reality, the synonymy of geology is a\r\nstill more important part of the subject than the analogy of botany\r\nwould lead us to suppose. For in plants, the species are really\r\nfixed, and easily known when seen; and the ambiguity is only in the\r\nimperfect communication or confused ideas of the observers. But in\r\ngeology, the identity of a stratum or formation in different places,\r\nthough not an arbitrary, may be a very doubtful matter, even to him\r\nwho has seen and examined. To assign its right character and place\r\nto a stratum in a new country, is, in a great degree, to establish\r\nthe whole geological history of the country. To assume that the same\r\nnames may rightly be applied to the strata of different countries,\r\nis to take for granted, not indeed the Wernerian dogma of universal\r\nformations, but a considerable degree of generality and uniformity\r\nin the known formations. And how far this generality and uniformity\r\nprevail, observation alone can teach. The search for geological\r\nsynonyms in different countries brings before us two\r\nquestions;--first, _are_ there such synonyms? and only in the second\r\nplace, and as far as they occur, _what_ are they?\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is found that although formations which must be considered\r\nas geologically identical (because otherwise no classification is\r\npossible,) do extend over large regions, and pass from country to\r\ncountry, their identity includes certain modifications; and the\r\ndetermination of the identity and of the modifications are inseparably\r\ninvolved with each other, and almost necessarily entangled with\r\ntheoretical considerations. And in two countries, in which we find\r\nthis modified coincidence, instead of saying that the strata are\r\nidentical, and that their designations are synonyms, we may, with more\r\npropriety, consider them as two corresponding series; of which the\r\nmembers of the one may be treated as the _Representatives_ or\r\n_Equivalents_ of the members of the other.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of Representatives or Equivalents supposes that the\r\ngeological phenomena in the two countries have been the results of\r\n{532} similar series of events, which have, in some measure, coincided\r\nin time and order; and thus, as we have said, refers us to a theory.\r\nBut yet, considered merely as a step in classification, the comparison\r\nof the geological series of strata in different countries is, in the\r\nhighest degree, important and interesting. Indeed in the same manner\r\nin which the separation of Classificatory from Chemical Mineralogy is\r\nnecessary for the completion of mineralogical science, the comparative\r\nClassification of the strata of different countries according to their\r\nresemblances and differences alone, is requisite as a basis for a\r\nTheory of their causes. But, as will easily be imagined from its\r\nnature, this part of descriptive geology deals with the most difficult\r\nand the most elevated problems; and requires a rare union of laborious\r\nobservation with a comprehensive spirit of philosophical\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nIn order to give instances of this process (for of the vast labor\r\nand great talents which have been thus employed in England, France,\r\nand Germany, it is only instances that we can give,) I may refer to\r\nthe geological survey of France, which was executed, as we have\r\nalready stated, by order of the government. In this undertaking it\r\nwas intended to obtain a knowledge of the whole mineral structure of\r\nFrance; but no small portion of this knowledge was brought into\r\nview, when a synonymy had been established between the Secondary\r\nRocks of France and the corresponding members of the English and\r\nGerman series, which had been so well studied as to have become\r\nclassical points of standard reference. For the purpose of doing\r\nthis, the principal directors of the survey, MM. Brochant de\r\nVilliers, De Beaumont, and Dufrénoy, came to England in 1822, and\r\nfollowing the steps of the best English geologists, in a few months\r\nmade themselves acquainted with the English series. They then\r\nreturned to France, and, starting from the chalk of Paris in various\r\ndirections, travelled on the lines which carried them over the edges\r\nof the strata which emerge from beneath the chalk, identifying, as\r\nthey could, the strata with their foreign analogues. They thus\r\nrecognized almost all of the principal beds of the oolitic series of\r\nEngland.[52\\18] At the same time they found differences as well as\r\nresemblances. Thus the Portland and Kimmeridge beds of France were\r\nfound to contain in abundance a certain shell, the _gryphæa\r\nvirgula_, which had not before been much remarked in those beds in\r\nEngland. With regard to the synonyms in Germany, on the other hand,\r\na difference of opinion {538} arose between M. Elie de Beaumont and\r\nM. Voltz,[53\\18] the former considering the _Grès de Vosges_ as the\r\nequivalent of the _Rothe todte liegende_, which occurs beneath the\r\nZechstein, while M. Voltz held that it was the lower portion of the\r\nRed or _Variegated Sandstone_ which rests on the Zechstein.\r\n\r\n[Note 52\\18: De la Beche, _Manual_, 305.]\r\n\r\n[Note 53\\18: De la Beche, _Manual_, 381.]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, from the first promulgation of the Wernerian\r\nsystem, attempts were made to identify the English with the German\r\nmembers of the geological alphabet; but it was long before this\r\nalphabet was rightly read. Thus the English geologists who first\r\ntried to apply the Wernerian series to this country, conceived the\r\nOld and New Red Sandstone of England to be the same with the Old and\r\nNew Red Sandstone of Werner; whereas Werner's Old Red, the Rothe\r\ntodte liegende, is above the coal, while the English Old Red is\r\nbelow it. This mistake led to a further erroneous identification of\r\nour Mountain Limestone with Werner's First Flötz Limestone; and\r\ncaused an almost inextricable confusion, which, even at a recent\r\nperiod, has perplexed the views of German geologists respecting this\r\ncountry. Again, the Lias of England was, at first, supposed to be\r\nthe equivalent of the Muschelkalk of Germany. But the error of this\r\nidentification was brought into view by examinations and discussions\r\nin which MM. Œyenhausen and Dechen took the lead; and at a later\r\nperiod, Professor Sedgwick, by a laborious examination of the strata\r\nof England, was enabled to show the true relation of this part of\r\nthe geology of the two countries. According to him, the New Red\r\nSandstone of England, considered as one great complex formation, may\r\nbe divided into seven members, composed of sandstones, limestones,\r\nand marls; five of which represent respectively the _Rothe todte\r\nliegende_; the _Kupfer schiefer_; the _Zechstein_, (with the\r\n_Rauchwacké_, _Asche_, and _Stinkstein_ of the Thuringenwald;) the\r\n_Bunter sandstein_; and the _Keuper_: while the _Muschelkalk_, which\r\nlies between the two last members of the German list, has not yet\r\nbeen discovered in our geological series. \"Such a coincidence,\" he\r\nobserves,[54\\18] \"in the subdivisions of two distant mechanical\r\ndeposits, even upon the supposition of their being strictly\r\ncontemporaneous, is truly astonishing. It has not been assumed\r\nhypothetically, but is the fair result of the facts which are\r\nrecorded in this paper.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 54\\18: _Geol. Trans._ Second Series, iii. 121.]\r\n\r\nAs an example in which the study of geological equivalents becomes\r\nstill more difficult, we may notice the attempts to refer the strata\r\nof {534} the Alps to those of the north-west of Europe. The\r\ndark-colored marbles and schists resembling mica slate[55\\18] were,\r\nduring the prevalence of the Wernerian theory, referred, as was\r\nnatural, to the transition class. The striking physical characters\r\nof this mountain region, and its long-standing celebrity as a\r\nsubject of mineralogical examination, made a complete subversion of\r\nthe received opinion respecting its place in the geological series,\r\nan event of great importance in the history of the science. Yet this\r\nwas what occurred when Dr. Buckland, in 1820, threw his piercing\r\nglance upon this district. He immediately pointed out that these\r\nmasses, by their fossils, approach to the Oolitic Series of this\r\ncountry. From this view it followed, that the geological equivalents\r\nof that series were to be found among rocks in which the\r\nmineralogical characters were altogether different, and that the\r\nloose limestones of England represent some of the highly-compact and\r\ncrystalline marbles of Italy and Greece. This view was confirmed by\r\nsubsequent investigations; and the correspondence was traced, not\r\nonly in the general body of the formations, but in the occurrence of\r\nthe Red Marl at its bottom, and the Green Sand and Chalk at its top.\r\n\r\n[Note 55\\18: De la Beche, _Manual_, 313.]\r\n\r\nThe talents and the knowledge which such tasks require are of no\r\nordinary kind; nor, even with a consummate acquaintance with the\r\nwell-ascertained formations, can the place of problematical strata\r\nbe decided without immense labor. Thus the examination and\r\ndelineation of hundreds of shells by the most skilful conchologists,\r\nhas been thought necessary in order to determine whether the\r\ncalcareous beds of Maestricht and of Gosau are or are not\r\nintermediate, as to their organic contents, between the chalk and\r\nthe tertiary formations. And scarcely any point of geological\r\nclassification can be settled without a similar union of the\r\naccomplished naturalist with the laborious geological collector.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the views already presented, of this part of geology,\r\nthat no attempt to apply to distant countries the names by which the\r\nwell-known European strata have been described, can be of any value,\r\nif not accompanied by a corresponding attempt to show how far the\r\nEuropean series is really applicable. This must be borne in mind in\r\nestimating the import of the geological accounts which have been given\r\nof various parts of Asia, Africa, and America. For instance, when the\r\ncarboniferous group and the new red sandstone are stated to {535} be\r\nfound in India, we require to be assured that these formations are, in\r\nsome way, the equivalents of their synonyms in countries better\r\nexplored. Till this is done, the results of observation in such places\r\nwould be better conveyed by a nomenclature implying only those facts\r\nof resemblance, difference, and order, which have been ascertained in\r\nthe country so described. We know that serious errors were incurred by\r\nthe attempts made to identify the Tertiary strata of other countries\r\nwith those first studied in the Paris basin. Fancied points of\r\nresemblance, Mr. Lyell observes, were magnified into undue importance,\r\nand essential differences in mineral character and organic contents\r\nwere slurred over.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The extension of geological surveys, the construction of\r\ngeological maps, and the determination of the geological equivalents\r\nwhich replace each other in various countries, have been carried on\r\nin continuation of the labors mentioned above, with enlarged\r\nactivity, range, and means. It is estimated that one-third of the\r\nland of each hemisphere has been geologically explored; and that\r\nthus Descriptive Geology has now been prosecuted so far, that it is\r\nnot likely that even the extension of it to the whole globe would\r\ngive any material novelty of aspect to Theoretical Geology. The\r\nrecent literature of the subject is so voluminous that it is\r\nimpossible for me to give any account of it here; very imperfectly\r\nacquainted, as I am, even with the English portion, and still more,\r\nwith what has been produced in other countries.\r\n\r\nWhile I admire the energetic and enlightened labors by which the\r\nphilosophers of France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Russia, and\r\nAmerica, have promoted scientific geology, I may be allowed to\r\nrejoice to see in the very phraseology of the subject, the evidence\r\nthat English geologists have not failed to contribute their share to\r\nthe latest advances in the science. The following order of strata\r\nproceeding upwards is now, I think, recognized throughout Europe.\r\nThe _Silurian_; the _Devonian_ (Old Red Sandstone;) the\r\n_Carboniferous_; the _Permian_, (Lower part of the new Red Sandstone\r\nseries;) the _Trias_, (Upper three members of the New Red Sandstone\r\nseries;) the _Lias_; the _Oolite_, (in which are reckoned by M.\r\nD'Orbigny the Etages _Bathonien_, _Oxonien_, _Kimmeridgien_, and\r\n_Portlandien_;) the _Neocomien_, (Lower Green Sand,) the Chalk; and\r\nabove these, Tertiary and Supra-Tertiary beds. Of these, the\r\nSilurian, described by Sir R. Murchison from its types in South\r\nWales, has been traced by European Geologists through the Ardennes,\r\nServia, Turkey, the shores of the Gulf of Finland, the valley {536}\r\nof the Mississippi, the west coast of North America, and the\r\nmountains of South America. Again, the labors of Prof. Sedgwick and\r\nSir R. Murchison, in 1836, '7, and '8, aided by the sagacity of Mr.\r\nLonsdale, led to their placing certain rocks of Devon and Cornwall\r\nas a formation intermediate between the Silurian and Carboniferous\r\nSeries; and the Devonian System thus established has been accepted\r\nby geologists in general, and has been traced, not only in various\r\nparts of Europe, but in Australia and Tasmania, and in the\r\nneighborhood of the Alleganies.\r\n\r\nAbove the Carboniferous Series, Sir R. Murchison and his fellow\r\nlaborers, M. de Verneuil and Count Keyserling, have found in Russia\r\na well-developed series of rocks occupying the ancient kingdom of\r\nPermia, which they have hence called the _Permian formation_; and\r\nthis term also has found general acceptance. The next group, the\r\nKeuper, Muschelkalk, and Bunter Sandstein of Germany, has been\r\ntermed _Trias_ by the continental geologists. The _Neocomien_ is\r\ncalled from Neuchatel, where it is largely developed. Below all\r\nthese rocks come, in England, the _Cambrian_ on which Prof. Sedgwick\r\nhas expended so many years of valuable labor. The comparison of the\r\nProtozoic and Hypozoic rocks of different countries is probably\r\nstill incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe geologists of North America have made great progress in\r\ndecyphering and describing the structure of their own country; and\r\nthey have wisely gone, in a great measure, upon the plan which I\r\nhave commended at the end of the third Chapter;--they have compared\r\nthe rocks of their own country with each other, and given to the\r\ndifferent beds and formations names borrowed from their own\r\nlocalities. This course will facilitate rather than impede the\r\nredaction of their classification to its synonyms and equivalents in\r\nthe old world.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not to be expected nor desired that books belonging\r\nto Descriptive Geology shall exclude the other two branches of the\r\nsubject, Geological Dynamics and Physical Geology. On the contrary,\r\namong the most valuable contributions to both these departments have\r\nbeen speculations appended to descriptive works. And this is\r\nnaturally and rightly more and more the case as the description\r\nembraces a wider field. The noble work _On the Geology of Russia and\r\nthe Urals_, by Sir Roderick Murchison and his companions, is a great\r\nexample of this, as of other merits in a geological book. The author\r\nintroduces into his pages the various portions of geological\r\ndynamics of which I shall have to speak afterwards; and thus\r\nendeavors to make out the {537} physical history of the region, the\r\nboundaries of its raised sea bottoms, the shores of the great\r\ncontinent on which the mammoths lived, the period when the gold ore\r\nwas formed, and when the watershed of the Ural chain was elevated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS TO DISCOVER GENERAL LAWS IN GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_General Geological Phenomena._\r\n\r\nBESIDES thus noticing such features in the rocks of each country as\r\nwere necessary to the identification of the strata, geologists have\r\nhad many other phenomena of the earth's surface and materials\r\npresented to their notice; and these they have, to a certain extent,\r\nattempted to generalize, so as to obtain on this subject what we\r\nhave elsewhere termed the Laws of Phenomena, which are the best\r\nmaterials for physical theory. Without dwelling long upon these, we\r\nmay briefly note some of the most obvious. Thus it has been observed\r\nthat mountain ranges often consist of a ridge of subjacent rock, on\r\nwhich lie, on each side, strata sloping from the ridge. Such a ridge\r\nis an _Anticlinal Line_, a _Mineralogical Axis_. The sloping strata\r\npresent their _Escarpements_, or steep edges, to this axis. Again,\r\nin mining countries, the _Veins_ which contain the ore are usually a\r\nsystem of _parallel_ and nearly vertical partitions in the rock; and\r\nthese are, in very many cases, intersected by another system of\r\nveins parallel to each other and nearly _perpendicular_ to the\r\nformer. Rocky regions are often intersected by _Faults_, or fissures\r\ninterrupting the strata, in which the rock on one side the fissure\r\nappears to have been at first continuous with that on the other, and\r\nshoved aside or up or down after the fracture. Again, besides these\r\nlarger fractures, rocks have _Joints_,--separations, or tendencies\r\nto separate in some directions rather than in others; and a _slaty\r\nCleavage_, in which the parallel subdivisions may be carried on, so\r\nas to produce laminæ of indefinite thinness. As an example of those\r\nlaws of phenomena of which we have spoken, we may instance the\r\ngeneral law asserted by Prof. {538} Sedgwick (not, however, as free\r\nfrom exception), that in one particular class of rocks the slaty\r\nCleavage _never_ coincides with the Direction of the strata.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of metalliferous veins may be referred to, as another\r\nlarge class of facts which demand the notice of the geologist. It\r\nwould be difficult to point out briefly any general laws which\r\nprevail in such cases; but in order to show the curious and complex\r\nnature of the facts, it may be sufficient to refer to the\r\ndescription of the metallic veins of Cornwall by Mr. Carne;[56\\18]\r\nin which the author maintains that their various contents, and the\r\nmanner in which they cut across, and _stop_, or _shift_, each other,\r\nleads naturally to the assumption of veins of no less than six or\r\neight different ages in one kind of rock.\r\n\r\n[Note 56\\18: _Transactions of the Geol. Soc. of Cornwall_, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nAgain, as important characters belonging to the physical history of\r\nthe earth, and therefore to geology, we may notice all the general\r\nlaws which refer to its temperature;--both the laws of climate, as\r\ndetermined by the _isothermal lines_, which Humboldt has drawn, by\r\nthe aid of very numerous observations made in all parts of the\r\nworld; and also those still more curious facts, of the increase of\r\ntemperature which takes place as we descend in the solid mass. The\r\nlatter circumstance, after being for a while rejected as a fable, or\r\nexplained away as an accident, is now generally acknowledged to be\r\nthe true state of things in many distant parts of the globe, and\r\nprobably in all.\r\n\r\nAgain, to turn to cases of another kind: some writers have\r\nendeavored to state in a general manner laws according to which the\r\nmembers of the geological series succeed each other; and to reduce\r\napparent anomalies to order of a wider kind. Among those who have\r\nwritten with such views, we may notice Alexander von Humboldt,\r\nalways, and in all sciences, foremost in the race of generalization.\r\nIn his attempt to extend the doctrine of geological equivalents from\r\nthe rocks of Europe[57\\18] to those of the Andes, he has marked by\r\nappropriate terms the general modes of geological succession. \"I\r\nhave insisted,\" he says[58\\18] \"principally upon the phenomena of\r\n_alternation_, _oscillation_, and _local suppression_, and on those\r\npresented by the _passages_ of formations from one to another, by\r\nthe effect of an _interior developement_.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 57\\18: _Gissement des Roches dans les deux Hemisphères_, 1823.]\r\n\r\n[Note 58\\18: Pref. p. vi.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of alternation to which M. de Humboldt here refers\r\nare, in fact, very curious: as exhibiting a mode in which the\r\ntransitions from one formation to another may become gradual and\r\ninsensible, {539} instead of sudden and abrupt. Thus the coal\r\nmeasures in the south of England are above the mountain limestone;\r\nand the distinction of the formations is of the most marked kind.\r\nBut as we advance northward into the coal-field of Yorkshire and\r\nDurham, the subjacent limestone begins to be subdivided by thick\r\nmasses of sandstone and carbonaceous strata, and passes into a\r\ncomplex deposit, not distinguishable from the overlying coal\r\nmeasures; and in this manner the transition from the limestone to\r\nthe coal is made by alternation. Thus, to use another expression of\r\nM. de Humboldt's in ascending from the limestone, the coal, before\r\nwe quit the subjacent stratum, _preludes_ to its fuller exhibition\r\nin the superior beds.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to another point: geologists have gone on up to the\r\npresent time endeavoring to discover general laws and facts, with\r\nregard to the position of mountain and mineral masses upon the\r\nsurface of the earth. Thus M. Von Buch, in his physical description\r\nof the Canaries, has given a masterly description of the lines of\r\nvolcanic action and volcanic products, all over the globe. And, more\r\nrecently, M. Elie de Beaumont has offered some generalizations of a\r\nstill wider kind. In this new doctrine, those mountain ranges, even\r\nin distant parts of the world, which are of the same age, according\r\nto the classifications already spoken of, are asserted to be\r\nparallel[59\\18] to each other, while those ranges which are of\r\ndifferent ages lie in different directions. This very wide and\r\nstriking proposition may be considered as being at present upon its\r\ntrial among the geologists of Europe.[60\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 59\\18: We may observe that the notion of parallelism, when\r\napplied to lines drawn on _remote_ portions of a globular surface,\r\nrequires to be interpreted in so arbitrary a manner, that we can\r\nhardly imagine it to express a physical law.]\r\n\r\n[Note 60\\18: Mr. Lyell, in the sixth edition of his _Principles_, B.\r\ni. c. xii., has combated the hypothesis of M. Elie de Beaumont,\r\nstated in the text. He has argued both against the catastrophic\r\ncharacter of the elevation of mountain chains, and the parallelism\r\nof the contemporaneous ridges. It is evident that the former\r\ndoctrine may be true, though the latter be shown to be false.]\r\n\r\nAmong the organic phenomena, also, which have been the subject of\r\ngeological study, general laws of a very wide and comprehensive kind\r\nhave been suggested, and in a greater or less degree confirmed by\r\nadequate assemblages of facts. Thus M. Adolphe Brongniart has not\r\nonly, in his _Fossil Flora_, represented and skilfully restored a\r\nvast number of the plants of the ancient world; but he has also, in\r\nthe _Prodromus_ of the work, presented various important and\r\nstriking views of the general character of the vegetation of former\r\nperiods, as {540} insular or continental, tropical or temperate. And\r\nM. Agassiz, by the examination of an incredible number of specimens\r\nand collections of fossil fish, has been led to results which,\r\nexpressed in terms of his own ichthyological classification, form\r\nremarkable general laws. Thus, according to him,[61\\18] when we go\r\nbelow the lias, we lose all traces of two of the four orders under\r\nwhich he comprehends all known kinds of fish; namely, the\r\n_Cycloïdean_ and the _Ctenoïdean_; while the other two orders, the\r\n_Ganoïdean_ and _Placoïdean_, rare in our days, suddenly appear in\r\ngreat numbers, together with large sauroid and carnivorous fishes.\r\nCuvier, in constructing his great work on ichthyology, transferred\r\nto M. Agassiz the whole subject of fossil fishes, thus showing how\r\nhighly he esteemed his talents as a naturalist. And M. Agassiz has\r\nshown himself worthy of his great predecessor in geological natural\r\nhistory, not only by his acuteness and activity, but by the\r\ncomprehensive character of his zoological philosophy, and by the\r\ncourage with which he has addressed himself to the vast labors which\r\nlie before him. In his _Report on the Fossil Fish discovered in\r\nEngland_, published in 1835, he briefly sketches some of the large\r\nquestions which his researches have suggested; and then adds,[62\\18]\r\n\"Such is the meagre outline of a history of the highest interest,\r\nfull of curious episodes, but most difficult to relate. To unfold\r\nthe details which it contains will be the business of my life.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 61\\18: Greenough, _Address to Geol. Soc._ 1835, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Note 62\\18: _Brit. Assoc. Report_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [In proceeding downwards through the series of formations\r\ninto which geologists have distributed the rocks of the earth, one\r\nclass of organic forms after another is found to disappear. In the\r\nTertiary Period we find all the classes of the present world:\r\nMammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Crustaceans, Mollusks, Zoophytes.\r\nIn the Secondary Period, from the Chalk down to the New Red\r\nSandstone, Mammals are not found, with the minute exception of the\r\nmarsupial _amphitherium_ and _phascolotherium_ in the Stonesfield\r\nslate. In the Carboniferous and Devonian period we have no large\r\nReptiles, with, again, a minute amount of exception. In the lower\r\npart of the Silurian rocks, Fishes vanish, and we have no animal\r\nforms but Mollusks, Crustaceans and Zoophytes.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous, Devonian and Silurian formations, thus containing\r\nthe oldest forms of life, have been termed _palæozoic_. The\r\nboundaries of the life-bearing series have not yet been determined;\r\nbut the series in which vertebrated animals do not appear has been\r\n{541} provisionally termed _protozoic_, and the lower Silurian rocks\r\nmay probably be looked upon as its upper members. Below this,\r\ngeologists place a _hypozoic_ or _azoic_ series of rocks.\r\n\r\nGeologists differ as to the question whether these changes in the\r\ninhabitants of the globe were made by determinate steps or by\r\ninsensible gradations. M. Agassiz has been led to the conviction\r\nthat the organized population of the globe was renewed in the\r\ninterval of each principal member of its formations.[63\\18] Mr.\r\nLyell, on the other hand, conceives that the change in the\r\ncollection of organized beings was gradual, and has proposed on this\r\nsubject an hypothesis which I shall hereafter consider.]\r\n\r\n[Note 63\\18: _Brit. Assoc. Report_ 1842, p. 83.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Transition to Geological Dynamics._\r\n\r\nWHILE we have been giving this account of the objects with which\r\nDescriptive Geology is occupied, it must have been felt how\r\ndifficult it is, in contemplating such facts, to confine ourselves\r\nto description and classification. Conjectures and reasonings\r\nrespecting the causes of the phenomena force themselves upon us at\r\nevery step; and even influence our classification and nomenclature.\r\nOur Descriptive Geology impels us to endeavor to construct a\r\nPhysical Geology. This close connexion of the two branches of the\r\nsubject by no means invalidates the necessity of distinguishing\r\nthem: as in Botany, although the formation of a Natural System\r\nnecessarily brings us to physiological relations, we still\r\ndistinguish Systematic from Physiological Botany.\r\n\r\nSupposing, however, our Descriptive Geology to be completed, as far\r\nas can be done without considering closely the causes by which the\r\nstrata have been produced, we have now to enter upon the other\r\nprovince of the science, which treats of those causes, and of which\r\nwe have already spoken, as _Physical Geology_. But before we can\r\ntreat this department of speculation in a manner suitable to the\r\nconditions of science, and to the analogy of other parts of our\r\nknowledge, a certain intermediate and preparatory science must be\r\nformed, of which we shall now consider the origin and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{542}}\r\nGEOLOGICAL DYNAMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nINORGANIC GEOLOGICAL DYNAMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Necessity and Object of a Science of Geological\r\nDynamics._\r\n\r\nWHEN the structure and arrangement which men observed in the\r\nmaterials of the earth instigated them to speculate concerning the\r\npast changes and revolutions by which such results had been\r\nproduced, they at first supposed themselves sufficiently able to\r\njudge what would be the effects of any of the obvious agents of\r\nchange, as water or volcanic fire. It did not at once occur to them\r\nto suspect, that their common and extemporaneous judgment on such\r\npoints was far from sufficient for sound knowledge;--they did not\r\nforesee that they must create a special science, whose object should\r\nbe to estimate the general laws and effects of assumed causes,\r\nbefore they could pronounce whether such causes had actually\r\nproduced the particular facts which their survey of the earth had\r\ndisclosed to them.\r\n\r\nYet the analogy of the progress of knowledge on other subjects\r\npoints out very clearly the necessity of such a science. When\r\nphenomenal astronomy had arrived at a high point of completeness, by\r\nthe labors of ages, and especially by the discovery of Kepler's\r\nlaws, astronomers were vehemently desirous of knowing the causes of\r\nthese motions; and sanguine men, such as Kepler, readily conjectured\r\nthat the motions were the effects of certain virtues and influences,\r\nby which the heavenly bodies acted upon each other. But it did not\r\nat first occur to him and his fellow-speculators, that they had not\r\nascertained what motions the influences of one body upon another\r\ncould produce: and that, therefore, they were not prepared to judge\r\nwhether such causes as they spoke of, did really regulate the\r\nmotions of the planets. Yet such was found to be the necessary\r\ncourse of sound inference. Men needed a science of motion, in order\r\nto arrive at a science of the {543} heavenly motions: they could not\r\nadvance in the study of the Mechanics of the heavens, till they had\r\nlearned the Mechanics of terrestrial bodies. And thus they were, in\r\nsuch speculations, at a stand for nearly a century, from the time of\r\nKepler to the time of Newton, while the science of Mechanics was\r\nformed by Galileo and his successors. Till that task was executed,\r\nall the attempts to assign the causes of cosmical phenomena were\r\nfanciful guesses and vague assertions; after that was done, they\r\nbecame demonstrations. The science of _Dynamics_ enabled\r\nphilosophers to pass securely and completely from _Phenomenal\r\nAstronomy_ to _Physical Astronomy_.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in order that we may advance from Phenomenal Geology\r\nto Physical Geology, we need a science of _Geological\r\nDynamics_;--that is, a science which shall investigate and determine\r\nthe laws and consequences of the known causes of changes such as\r\nthose which Geology considers:--and which shall do this, not in an\r\noccasional, imperfect, and unconnected manner, but by systematic,\r\ncomplete, and conclusive methods;--shall, in short, be a Science,\r\nand not a promiscuous assemblage of desultory essays.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of such a study, as a distinct branch of geology, is\r\nperhaps hardly yet formally recognized, although the researches\r\nwhich belong to it have, of late years, assumed a much more\r\nmethodical and scientific character than they before possessed. Mr.\r\nLyell's work (_Principles of Geology_), in particular, has eminently\r\ncontributed to place Geological Dynamics in its proper prominent\r\nposition. Of the four books of his Treatise, the second and third\r\nare upon this division of the subject; the second book treating of\r\naqueous and igneous causes of change, and the third, of changes in\r\nthe organic world.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in separating this auxiliary geological\r\nscience from theoretical Geology itself, in which we apply our\r\nprinciples to the explanation of the actual facts of the earth's\r\nsurface. The former, if perfected, would be a demonstrative science\r\ndealing with general cases; the latter is an ætiological view having\r\nreference to special facts; the one attempts to determine what\r\nalways must be under given conditions; the other is satisfied with\r\nknowing what is and has been, and why it has been; the first study\r\nhas a strong resemblance to Mechanics, the other to philosophical\r\nArchæology.\r\n\r\nSince this portion of science is still so new, it is scarcely\r\npossible to give any historical account of its progress, or any\r\ncomplete survey of its shape and component parts. I can only attempt\r\na few notices, {544} which may enable us in some measure to judge to\r\nwhat point this division of our subject is tending.\r\n\r\nWe may remark, in this as in former cases, that since we have here\r\nto consider the formation and progress of a _science_, we must treat\r\nas unimportant preludes to its history, the detached and casual\r\nobservations of the effects of causes of change which we find in\r\nolder writers. It is only when we come to systematic collections of\r\ninformation, such as may afford the means of drawing general\r\nconclusions; or to rigorous deductions from known laws of\r\nnature;--that we can recognise the separate existence of geological\r\ndynamics, as a path of scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe following may perhaps suffice, for the present, as a sketch of\r\nthe subjects of which this science treats:--the aqueous causes of\r\nchange, or those in which water adds to, takes from, or transfers,\r\nthe materials of the land:--the igneous causes; volcanoes, and,\r\nclosely connected with them, earthquakes, and the forces by which\r\nthey are produced;--the calculations which determine, on physical\r\nprinciples, the effects of assumed mechanical causes acting upon\r\nlarge portions of the crust of the earth;--the effect of the forces,\r\nwhatever they be, which produce the crystalline texture of rocks,\r\ntheir fissile structure, and the separation of materials, of which\r\nwe see the results in metalliferous veins. Again, the estimation of\r\nthe results of changes of temperature in the earth, whether\r\noperating by pressure, expansion, or in any other way;--the effects\r\nof assumed changes in the superficial condition, extent, and\r\nelevation, of terrestrial continents upon the climates of the\r\nearth;--the effect of assumed cosmical changes upon the temperature\r\nof this planet;--and researches of the same nature as these.\r\n\r\nThese researches are concerned with the causes of change in the\r\ninorganic world; but the subject requires no less that we should\r\ninvestigate the causes which may modify the forms and conditions of\r\norganic things; and in the large sense in which we have to use the\r\nphrase, we may include researches on such subjects also as parts of\r\nGeological Dynamics; although, in truth, this department of\r\nphysiology has been cultivated, as it well deserves to be,\r\nindependently of its bearing upon geological theories. The great\r\nproblem which offers itself here, in reference to Geology, is, to\r\nexamine the value of any hypotheses by which it may be attempted to\r\nexplain the succession of different races of animals and plants in\r\ndifferent strata; and though it may be difficult, in this inquiry,\r\nto arrive at any positive result, we {545} may at least be able to\r\nshow the improbability of some conjectures which have been\r\npropounded.\r\n\r\nI shall now give a very brief account of some of the attempts made\r\nin these various departments of this province of our knowledge; and\r\nin the present chapter, of Inorganic Changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Aqueous Causes of Change._\r\n\r\nTHE controversies to which the various theories of geologists gave\r\nrise, proceeding in various ways upon the effects of the existing\r\ncauses of change, led men to observe, with some attention and\r\nperseverance, the actual operation of such causes. In this way, the\r\nknown effect of the Rhine, in filling up the Lake of Geneva at its\r\nupper extremity, was referred to by De Luc, Kirwan, and others, in\r\ntheir dispute with the Huttonians; and attempts were even made to\r\ncalculate how distant the period was, when this alluvial deposit\r\nfirst began. Other modern observers have attended to similar facts\r\nin the natural history of rivers and seas. But the subject may be\r\nconsidered as having first assumed its proper form, when taken up by\r\nMr. Von Hoff; of whose _History of the Natural Changes of the\r\nEarth's surface which are proved by Tradition_, the first part,\r\ntreating of aqueous changes, appeared in 1822. This work was\r\noccasioned by a Prize Question of the Royal Society of Göttingen,\r\npromulgated in 1818; in which these changes were proposed as the\r\nsubject of inquiry, with a special reference to geology. Although\r\nVon Hoff does not attempt to establish any general inductions upon\r\nthe facts which his book contains, the collection of such a body of\r\nfacts gave almost a new aspect to the subject, by showing that\r\nchanges in the relative extent of land and water were going on at\r\nevery time, and almost at every place; and that mutability and\r\nfluctuation in the form of the solid parts of the earth, which had\r\nbeen supposed by most persons to be a rare exception to the common\r\ncourse of events, was, in fact, the universal rule. But it was Mr.\r\nLyell's _Principles of Geology, being an attempt to explain the\r\nformer Changes of the Earth's Surface by the Causes now in action_\r\n(of which the first volume was published in 1830), which disclosed\r\nthe full effect of such researches on geology; and which attempted\r\nto present such assemblages of special facts, as examples of general\r\nlaws. Thus this work may, as we have said, be looked upon as the\r\nbeginning of Geological Dynamics, at least among us. Such\r\ngeneralizations and applications as it contains give the most lively\r\n{546} interest to a thousand observations respecting rivers and\r\nfloods, mountains and morasses, which otherwise appear without aim\r\nor meaning; and thus this department of science cannot fail to be\r\nconstantly augmented by contributions from every side. At the same\r\ntime it is clear, that these contributions, voluminous as they must\r\nbecome, must, from time to time, be resolved into laws of greater\r\nand greater generality; and that thus alone the progress of this, as\r\nof all other sciences, can be furthered.\r\n\r\nI need not attempt any detailed enumeration of the modes of aqueous\r\naction which are here to be considered. Some are destructive, as\r\nwhen the rivers erode the channels in which they flow; or when the\r\nwaves, by their perpetual assault, shatter the shores, and carry the\r\nruins of them into the abyss of the ocean. Some operations of the\r\nwater, on the other hand, add to the land; as when _deltas_ are\r\nformed at the mouths of rivers or when calcareous springs form\r\ndeposits of _travertin_. Even when bound in icy fetters, water is by\r\nno mean deprived of its active power; the _glacier_ carries into the\r\nvalley masses of its native mountain, and often, becoming ice-bergs,\r\nfloat with a lading of such materials far into the seas of the\r\ntemperate zone. It is indisputable that vast beds of worn down\r\nfragments of the existing land are now forming into strata at the\r\nbottom of the ocean; and that many other effects are constantly\r\nproduced by existing aqueous causes, which resemble some, at least,\r\nof the facts which geology has to explain.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The effects of glaciers above mentioned are obvious; but\r\nthe mechanism of these bodies,--the mechanical cause of their\r\nmotions,--was an unsolved problem till within a very few years. That\r\nthey slide as rigid masses;--that they advance by the expansion of\r\ntheir mass;--that they advance as a collection of rigid fragments;\r\nwere doctrines which were held by eminent physicists; though a very\r\nslight attention to the subject shows these opinions to be\r\nuntenable. In Professor James Forbes's theory on the subject\r\n(published in his _Travels through the Alps_, 1843,) we find a\r\nsolution of the problem, so simple, and yet so exact, as to produce\r\nthe most entire conviction. In this theory, the ice of a glacier is,\r\non a great scale, supposed to be a plastic or viscous mass, though\r\nsmall portions of it are sensibly rigid. It advances down the slope\r\nof the valley in which it lies as a plastic mass would do,\r\naccommodating itself to the varying shape and size of its bed, and\r\nshowing by its crevasses its mixed character between fluid and\r\nrigid. It shows this character still more curiously by a _ribboned_\r\n{547} _structure_ on a small scale, which is common in the solid ice\r\nof the glacier. The planes of these _ribbons_ are, for the most\r\npart, at right angles to the crevasses, near the sides of the\r\nglacier, while, near its central line, they _dip_ towards the upper\r\npart of the glacier. This structure appears to arise from the\r\ndifference of velocities of contiguous moving filaments of the icy\r\nmass, as the crevasses themselves arise from the tension of larger\r\nportions. Mr. Forbes has, in successive publications, removed the\r\nobjections which have been urged against this theory. In the last of\r\nthem, a Memoir in the _Phil. Trans._, 1846, (_Illustrations of the\r\nViscous Theory of Glacier Motion_,) he very naturally expresses\r\nastonishment at the opposition which has been made to the theory on\r\nthe ground of the rigidity of small pieces of ice. He has himself\r\nshown that the ice of glaciers has a plastic flexibility, by marking\r\nforty-five points in a transverse straight line upon the Mer de\r\nGlace, and observing them for several days. The straight line in\r\nthat time not only became oblique to the side, but also became\r\nvisibly curved.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Forbes and other philosophers have made it in the highest\r\ndegree probable that glaciers have existed in many places in which\r\nthey now exist no longer, and have exercised great powers in\r\ntransporting large blocks of rock, furrowing and polishing the rocks\r\nalong which they slide, and leaving lines and masses of detritus or\r\n_moraine_ which they had carried along with them or pushed before\r\nthem. It cannot be doubted that extinct glaciers have produced some\r\nof the effects which the geologist has to endeavor to explain. But\r\nthis part of the machinery of nature has been worked by some\r\ntheorists into an exaggerated form, in which it cannot, as I\r\nconceive, have any place in an account of Geological Dynamics which\r\naims at being permanent.\r\n\r\nThe great problem of the diffusion of drift and erratic blocks from\r\ntheir parent rocks to great distances, has driven geologists to the\r\nconsideration of other hypothetical machinery by which the effects\r\nmay be accounted for: especially the great _northern drift_ and\r\n_boulders_,--the rocks from the Scandinavian chain which cover the\r\nnorth of Europe on a vast area, having a length of 2000 and breadth\r\nof from 400 to 800 miles. The diffusion of these blocks has been\r\naccounted for by supposing them to be imbedded in icebergs, detached\r\nfrom the shore, and floated into oceanic spaces, where they have\r\ngrounded and been deposited by the melting of the ice. And this mode\r\nof action may to some extent be safely admitted into geological\r\nspeculation. For it is a matter of fact, that our navigators in\r\narctic and antarctic regions have {548} repeatedly seen icebergs and\r\nicefloes sailing along laden with such materials.\r\n\r\nThe above explanation of the phenomena of drift supposes the land on\r\nwhich the travelled materials are found to have been the bottom of a\r\nsea where they were deposited. But it does not, even granting the\r\nconditions, account for some of the facts observed;--that the drift\r\nand the boulders are deposited in \"trainées\" or streaks, which, in\r\ndirection, diverge from the parent rock;--and that the boulders are\r\nof smaller and smaller size, as they are found more remote from that\r\ncentre. These phenomena rather suggest the notion of currents of\r\nwater as the cause of the distribution of the materials into their\r\npresent situations. And though the supposition that the whole area\r\noccupied by drift and boulders was a sea-bottom when they were\r\nscattered over it much reduces the amount of violence which it is\r\nnecessary to assume in order to distribute the loose masses, yet\r\nstill the work appears to be beyond the possible effect of ordinary\r\nmarine currents, or any movements which would be occasioned by a\r\nslow and gradual rising of the centre of distribution.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that a _sudden_ rise of the centre of\r\ndistribution would cause a motion in the surrounding ocean sufficient\r\nto produce such an effect: and in confirmation of this reference has\r\nbeen made to Mr. Scott Russell's investigations with respect to waves,\r\nalready referred to. (Book VIII.) The wave in this case would be the\r\n_wave of translation_, in which the motion of the water is as great at\r\nthe bottom as at the top; and it has hence been asserted that by\r\nparoxysmal elevations of 100 or 200 feet, a current of 25 or 30 miles\r\nan hour might be accounted for. But I think it has not been\r\nsufficiently noted that at each point this \"current\" is transient: it\r\nlasts only while the wave is passing over the point, and therefore it\r\nwould only either carry a single mass the whole way with its own\r\nvelocity, or move through a short distance a series of masses over\r\nwhich it successively passed. It does not appear, therefore, that we\r\nhave here a complete account of the transport of a collection of\r\nmaterials, in which each part is transferred through great\r\ndistances:--except, indeed, we were to suppose a numerous succession\r\nof paroxysmal elevations. Such a _battery_ might, by successive\r\nshocks, transmitting their force through the water, diffuse the\r\nfragments of the central mass over any area, however wide.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the erratic blocks are found to rest on the lower\r\ndrift, is well explained by supposing the latter to have been spread\r\non the {549} sea bottom while rock-bearing ice-masses floated on the\r\nsurface till they deposited their lading.\r\n\r\nSir R. Murchison has pointed out another operation of ice in\r\nproducing mounds of rocky masses; namely, the effects of rivers and\r\nlakes, in climates where, as in Russia, the waters carry rocky\r\nfragments entangled in the winter ice, and leave them in heaps at\r\nthe highest level which the waters attain.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the effects of glaciers, now vanished, are\r\napparent in many places, especially in Switzerland and in England,\r\nand other phenomena of the like tendency, have led some of the most\r\neminent geologists to the conviction that, interior to the period of\r\nour present temperature, there was a _Glacial Period_, at which the\r\ntemperature of Europe was lower than it now is.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the study of the common operations of water may give the\r\ngeologist such an acquaintance with the laws of his subject as may\r\nmuch aid his judgment respecting the extent to which such effects\r\nmay proceed, a long course of observation and thought must be\r\nrequisite before such operations can be analysed into their\r\nfundamental principles, and become the subjects of calculation, or\r\nof rigorous reasoning in any manner which is as precise and certain\r\nas calculation. Various portions of Hydraulics have an important\r\nbearing upon these subjects, including some researches which have\r\nbeen pursued with no small labor by engineers and mathematicians; as\r\nthe effects of currents and waves, the laws of tides and of rivers,\r\nand many similar problems. In truth, however, such subjects have not\r\nhitherto been treated by mathematicians with much success; and\r\nprobably several generations must elapse before this portion of\r\ngeological dynamics can become an exact science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Igneous Causes of Change.--Motions of the Earth's\r\nSurface._\r\n\r\nTHE effects of volcanoes have long been noted as important and\r\nstriking features in the physical history of our globe; and the\r\nprobability of their connexion with many geological phenomena, had\r\nnot escaped notice at an early period. But it was not till more\r\nrecent times, that the full import of these phenomena was\r\napprehended. The person who first looked at such operations with\r\nthat commanding general view which showed their extensive connexion\r\nwith physical geology, was Alexander von Humboldt, who explored the\r\nvolcanic phenomena {550} of the New World, from 1799 to 1804. He\r\nremarked[64\\18] the linear distribution of volcanic domes,\r\nconsidering them as vents placed along the edge of vast fissures\r\ncommunicating with reservoirs of igneous matter, and extending\r\nacross whole continents. He observed, also, the frequent sympathy of\r\nvolcanic and terremotive action in remote districts of the earth's\r\nsurface, thus showing how deeply seated must be the cause of these\r\nconvulsions. These views strongly excited and influenced the\r\nspeculations of geologists; and since then, phenomena of this kind\r\nhave been collected into a general view as parts of a\r\nnatural-historical science. Von Hoff, in the second volume of the\r\nwork already mentioned, was one of the first who did this; \"At\r\nleast,\" he himself says,[65\\18] (1824,) \"it was not known to him\r\nthat any one before him had endeavored to combine so large a mass of\r\nfacts with the general ideas of the natural philosopher, so as to\r\nform a whole.\" Other attempts were, however, soon made. In 1825, M.\r\nvon Ungern-Sternberg published his book _On the Nature and Origin of\r\nVolcanoes_,[66\\18] in which, he says, his object is, to give an\r\nempirical representation of these phenomena. In the same year, Mr.\r\nPoulett Scrope published a work in which he described the known\r\nfacts of volcanic action; not, however, confining himself to\r\ndescription; his purpose being, as his title states, to consider\r\n\"the probable causes of their phenomena, the laws which determine\r\ntheir march, the disposition of their products, and their connexion\r\nwith the present state and past history of the globe; leading to the\r\nestablishment of a new theory of the earth.\" And in 1826, Dr.\r\nDaubeny, of Oxford, produced _A Description of Active_ and Extinct\r\n_Volcanoes_, including in the latter phrase the volcanic rocks of\r\ncentral France, of the Rhine, of northern and central Italy, and\r\nmany other countries. Indeed, the near connexion between the\r\nvolcanic effects now going on, and those by which the basaltic rocks\r\nof Auvergne and many other places had been produced, was, by this\r\ntime, no longer doubted by any; and therefore the line which here\r\nseparates the study of existing causes from that of past effects may\r\nseem to melt away. But yet it is manifest that the assumption of an\r\nidentity of scale and mechanism between volcanoes now active, and\r\nthe igneous catastrophes of which the products have {551} survived\r\ngreat revolutions on the earth's surface, is hypothetical; and all\r\nwhich depends on this assumption belongs to theoretical geology.\r\n\r\n[Note 64\\18: Humboldt, _Relation Historique_; and his other works.]\r\n\r\n[Note 65\\18: Vol. ii. Prop. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Note 66\\18: _Werden und Seyn des Vulkanischen Gebirges_. Carlsruhe,\r\n1825.]\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves, then, to volcanic effects, which have been\r\nproduced, certainly or probably, since the earth's surface assumed\r\nits present form, we have still an ample exhibition of powerful\r\ncauses of change, in the streams of lava and other materials emitted\r\nin eruptions; and still more in the earthquakes which, as men easily\r\nsatisfied themselves, are produced by the same causes as the\r\neruptions of volcanic fire.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell's work was important in this as in other portions of this\r\nsubject. He extended the conceptions previously entertained of the\r\neffects which such causes may produce, not only by showing how great\r\nthese operations are historically known to have been, and how\r\nconstantly they are going on, if we take into our survey the whole\r\nsurface of the earth; but still more, by urging the consequences\r\nwhich would follow in a long course of time from the constant\r\nrepetition of operations in themselves of no extraordinary amount. A\r\nlava-stream many miles long and wide, and several yards deep, a\r\nsubsidence or elevation of a portion of the earth's surface of a few\r\nfeet, are by no means extraordinary facts. Let these operations,\r\nsaid Mr. Lyell, be repeated thousands of times; and we have results\r\nof the same order with the changes which geology discloses.\r\n\r\nThe most mitigated earthquakes have, however, a character of\r\nviolence. But it has been thought by many philosophers that there is\r\nevidence of a change of level of the land in cases where none of\r\nthese violent operations are going on. The most celebrated of these\r\ncases is Sweden; the whole of the land from Gottenburg to the north\r\nof the Gulf of Bothnia has been supposed in the act of rising,\r\nslowly and insensibly, from the surrounding waters. The opinion of\r\nsuch a change of level has long been the belief of the inhabitants;\r\nand was maintained by Celsius in the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. It has since been conceived to be confirmed by various\r\nobservations of marks cut on the face of the rock; beds of shells,\r\nsuch as now live in the neighboring seas, raised to a considerable\r\nheight; and other indications. Some of these proofs appear doubtful;\r\nbut Mr. Lyell, after examining the facts upon the spot in 1834,\r\nsays, \"In regard to the proposition that the land, in certain parts\r\nof Sweden, is gradually rising, I have no hesitation in assenting to\r\nit, after my visit to the districts above alluded to.\"[67\\18] If\r\nthis conclusion be generally accepted by {552} geologists, we have\r\nhere a daily example of the operation of some powerful agent which\r\nbelongs to geological dynamics; and which, for the purposes of the\r\ngeological theorist, does the work of the earthquake upon a very\r\nlarge scale, without assuming its terrors.\r\n\r\n[Note 67\\18: _Phil. Trans._ 1835, p. 32.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Examples of changes of level of large districts occurring\r\nat periods when the country has been agitated by earthquakes are\r\nwell ascertained, as the rising of the coast of Chili in 1822, and\r\nthe subsidence of the district of Cutch, in the delta of the Indus,\r\nin 1819. (Lyell, B. II. c. xv.) But the cases of more slow and\r\ntranquil movement seem also to be established. The gradual secular\r\nrise of the shore of the Baltic, mentioned in the text, has been\r\nconfirmed by subsequent investigation. It appears that the rate of\r\nelevation increases from Stockholm, where it is only a few inches in\r\na century, to the North Cape, where it is several feet. It appears\r\nalso that several other regions are in a like state of secular\r\nchange. The coast of Greenland is sinking. (Lyell, B. II. c. xviii.)\r\nAnd the existence of \"raised beaches\" along various coasts is now\r\ngenerally accepted among geologists. Such beaches, anciently forming\r\nthe margin of the sea, but now far above it, exist in many places;\r\nfor instance, along a great part of the Scotch coast; and among the\r\nraised beaches of that country we ought probably, with Mr. Darwin,\r\nto include the \"parallel roads\" of Glenroy, the subject, in former\r\ndays, of so much controversy among geologists and antiquaries.\r\n\r\nConnected with the secular rise and fall of large portions of the\r\nearth's surface, another agency which plays an important part in\r\nGeological dynamics has been the subject of some bold yet singularly\r\npersuasive speculations by Mr. Darwin. I speak of the formation of\r\nCoral, and Coral Reefs. He says that the coral-building animal works\r\nonly at small and definite distances below the surface. How then are\r\nwe to account for the vast number of coral islands, rings, and\r\nreefs, which are scattered over the Pacific and Indian Oceans! Can\r\nwe suppose that there are so many mountains, craters, and ridges,\r\nall exactly within a few feet of the same height through this vast\r\nportion of the globe's surface? This is incredible. How then are we\r\nto explain the facts? Mr. Darwin replies, that if we suppose the\r\nland to subside slowly beneath the sea, and at the same time suppose\r\nthe coralline zoophytes to go on building, so that their structure\r\nconstantly rises nearly to the surface of the water, we shall have\r\nthe facts explained. A submerged island will produce a ring; a long\r\ncoast, a barrier reef; and so on. Mr. Darwin also notes other\r\nphenomena, as {553} elevated beds of coral, which, occurring in\r\nother places, indicate a recent rising of the land; and on such\r\ngrounds as these he divides the surface of those parts of the ocean\r\ninto regions of elevation and of depression.\r\n\r\nThe labors of coralline zoophytes, as thus observed, form masses of\r\ncoral, such as are found fossilized in the strata of the earth. But\r\nour knowledge of the laws of life which have probably affected the\r\ndistribution of marine remains in strata, has received other very\r\nstriking accessions by the labors of Prof. Edward Forbes in\r\nobserving the marine animals of the Ægean Sea. He found that, even\r\nin their living state, the mollusks and zoophytes are already\r\ndistributed into strata. Dividing the depth into eight regions, from\r\n2 to 230 fathoms, he found that each region had its peculiar\r\ninhabitants, which disappeared speedily either in ascending or in\r\ndescending. The zero of animal life appeared to occur at about 300\r\nfathoms. This curious result bears in various ways upon geology. Mr.\r\nForbes himself has given an example of the mode in which it may be\r\napplied, by determining the depth at which the submarine eruption\r\ntook place which produced the volcanic isle of Neokaimeni in 1707.\r\nBy an examination of the fossils embedded in the pumice, he showed\r\nthat it came from the fourth region.[68\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 68\\18: _British Assoc. Reports_, 1843, p. 177.]\r\n\r\nTo the modes in which organized beings operate in producing the\r\nmaterials of the earth, we must add those pointed out by the\r\nextraordinary microscopic discoveries of Professor Ehrenberg. It\r\nappears that whole beds of earthy matter consist of the cases of\r\ncertain infusoria, the remains of these creatures being accumulated\r\nin numbers which it confounds our thoughts to contemplate.]\r\n\r\nSpeculations concerning the _causes_ of volcanoes and earthquakes,\r\nand of the rising and sinking of land, are a highly important\r\nportion of this science, at least as far as the calculation of the\r\npossible results of definite causes is concerned. But the various\r\nhypotheses which have been propounded on this subject can hardly be\r\nconsidered as sufficiently matured for such calculation. A mass of\r\nmatter in a state of igneous fusion, extending to the centre of the\r\nearth, even if we make such an hypothesis, requires some additional\r\ncause to produce eruption. The supposition that this fire may be\r\nproduced by intense chemical action between combining elements,\r\nrequires further, not only some agency to bring together such\r\nelements, but some reason why {554} they should be originally\r\nseparate. And if any other causes have been suggested, as\r\nelectricity or magnetism, this has been done so vaguely as to elude\r\nall possibility of rigorous deduction from the hypothesis. The\r\ndoctrine of a Central Heat, however, has occupied so considerable a\r\nplace in theoretical geology, that it ought undoubtedly to form an\r\narticle in geological dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_The Doctrine of Central Heat._\r\n\r\nTHE early geological theorists who, like Leibnitz and Buffon,\r\nassumed that the earth was originally a mass in a state of igneous\r\nfusion, naturally went on to deduce from this hypothesis, that the\r\ncrust consolidated and cooled before the interior, and that there\r\nmight still remain a central heat, capable of producing many\r\nimportant effects. But it is in more recent times that we have\r\nmeasures of such effects, and calculations which we can compare with\r\nmeasures. It was found, as we have said, that in descending below\r\nthe surface of the earth, the temperature of its materials\r\nincreased. Now it followed from Fourier's mathematical\r\ninvestigations of the distribution of heat in the earth, that if\r\nthere be no primitive heat (_chaleur d'origine_), the temperature,\r\nwhen we descend below the crust, will be constant in each vertical\r\nline. Hence an observed increase of temperature in descending,\r\nappeared to point out a central heat resulting from some cause now\r\nno longer in action.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of a central heat has usually been combined with the\r\nsupposition of a central igneous fluidity; for the heat in the\r\nneighborhood of the centre must be very intense, according to any\r\nlaw of its increase in descending which is consistent with known\r\nprinciples. But to this central fluidity it has been objected that\r\nsuch a fluid must be in constant circulation by the cooling of its\r\nexterior. Mr. Daniell found this to be the case in all fused metals.\r\nIt has also been objected that there must be, in such a central\r\nfluid, _tides_ produced by the moon and sun; but this inference\r\nwould require several additional suppositions and calculations to\r\ngive it a precise form.\r\n\r\nAgain, the supposition of a central heat of the earth, considered as\r\nthe effect of a more ancient state of its mass, appeared to indicate\r\nthat its cooling must still be going on. But if this were so, the\r\nearth might contract, as most bodies do when they cool; and this\r\ncontraction might lead to mechanical results, as the shortening of\r\nthe day. Laplace satisfied himself, by reference to ancient\r\nastronomical records, that no such {555} alteration in the length of\r\nthe day had taken place, even to the amount of one two-hundredth of\r\na second; and thus, there was here no confirmation of the hypothesis\r\nof a primitive heat of the earth.\r\n\r\nThough we find no evidence of the secular contraction of the earth\r\nin the observations with which astronomy deals, there are some\r\ngeological facts which at first appear to point to the reality of a\r\nrefrigeration within geological periods; as the existence of the\r\nremains of plants and shells of tropical climates, in the strata of\r\ncountries which are now near to or within the frigid zones. These\r\nfacts, however, have given rise to theories of the changes of\r\nclimate, which we must consider separately.\r\n\r\nBut we may notice, as connected with the doctrine of central heat,\r\nthe manner in which this hypothesis has been applied to explain\r\nvolcanic and geological phenomena. It does not enter into my plan,\r\nto consider explanations in which this central heat is supposed to\r\ngive rise to an expansive force,[69\\18] without any distinct\r\nreference to known physical laws. But we may notice; as more likely\r\nto become useful materials of the science now before us, such\r\nspeculations as those of Mr. Babbage; in which he combines the\r\ndoctrine of central heat with other physical laws;[70\\18] as, that\r\nsolid rocks _expand_ by being heated, but that clay contracts; that\r\ndifferent rocks and strata _conduct_ heat differently; that the\r\nearth _radiates_ heat differently, or at different parts of its\r\nsurface, according as it is covered with forests, with mountains,\r\nwith deserts, or with water. These principles, applied to large\r\nmasses, such as those which constitute the crust of the earth, might\r\ngive rise to changes as great as any which geology discloses. For\r\nexample: when the bed of a sea is covered by a thick deposit of new\r\nmatter worn from the shores, the strata below the bed, being\r\nprotected by a bad conductor of heat, will be heated, and, being\r\nheated, maybe expanded; or, as Sir J. Herschel has observed, may\r\nproduce explosion by the conversion of their moisture into steam.\r\nSuch speculations, when founded on real data and sound calculations,\r\nmay hereafter be of material use in geology.\r\n\r\n[Note 69\\18: Scrope _On Volcanoes_, p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Note 70\\18: _On the Temple of Serapis_, 1834. See also _Journal of\r\nthe Royal Inst._ vol.  ii., quoted in Conyb. and Ph. p. xv. Lyell,\r\nB. ii. c. xix. p. 383, (4th ed.) on Expansion of Stone.]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of central heat and fluidity has been rejected by some\r\neminent philosophers. Mr. Lyell's reasons for this rejection belong\r\n{556} rather to Theoretical Geology; but I may here notice M.\r\n**Poisson's opinion. He does not assent to the conclusion of Fourier,\r\nthat once the temperature increases in descending, there must be some\r\nprimitive central heat. On the contrary, he considers that such an\r\nincrease may arise from this;--that the earth, at some former period,\r\npassed (by the motion of the solar system in the universe,) **through\r\na portion of space which was warmer than the space in which it now\r\nrevolves (by reason, it may be, of the heat of other stars to which it\r\nwas then nearer). He supposes that, since such a period, the surface\r\nhas cooled down by the influence of the surrounding circumstances;\r\nwhile the interior, for a certain unknown depth, retains the trace of\r\nthe former elevation of temperature. But this assumption is not likely\r\nto expel the belief is the terrestrial origin of the subterraneous\r\nheat. For the supposition of such an inequality in the temperature of\r\nthe different regions in which the solar system is placed at different\r\ntimes, is altogether arbitrary; and, if pushed to the amount to which\r\nit must be carried, in order to account for the phenomenon, is highly\r\nimprobable.[71\\18] The doctrine of central heat, on the other hand,\r\n(which need not be conceived as implying the _universal_ fluidity of\r\nthe mass,) is not only naturally suggested by the subterraneous\r\nincrease of temperatures, but explains the spheroidal figure of the\r\nearth; and falls in with almost any theory which can be devised, of\r\nvolcanoes, earthquakes, and great geological changes.\r\n\r\n[Note 71\\18: For this hypothesis would make it necessary to suppose\r\nthat the earth has, at some former period, derived from some other\r\nstar or stars more heat than she now derives from the sun. But this\r\nwould imply, as highly probable, that at some period some other star\r\nor stars must have produced also a _mechanical_ effect upon the\r\nsolar system, greater than the effect of the sun. Now such a past\r\noperation of forces, fitted to obliterate all order and symmetry, is\r\nquite inconsistent with the simple, regular, and symmetrical\r\nrelation which the whole solar system, as far as Uranus, bears to\r\nthe present central body.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Problems respecting Elevations and Crystalline Forces._\r\n\r\nOTHER problems respecting the forces by which great masses of the\r\nearth's crust have been displaced, have also been solved by various\r\nmathematicians. It has been maintained by Von Buch that there occur,\r\nin various places, _craters of elevation_; that is, mountain-masses\r\nresembling the craters of volcanoes, but really produced by an\r\nexpansive force from below, bursting an aperture through horizontal\r\nstrata, {557} and elevating them in a conical form. Against this\r\ndoctrine, as exemplified in the most noted instances, strong\r\narguments have been adduced by other geologists. Yet the protrusion\r\nof fused rock by subterraneous forces upon a large scale is not\r\ndenied: and how far the examples of such operations may, in any\r\ncases, be termed craters of elevation, must be considered as a\r\nquestion not yet decided. On the supposition of the truth of Von\r\nBuch's doctrine, M. de Beaumont has calculated the relations of\r\nposition, the fissures, &c., which would arise. And Mr.\r\nHopkins,[72\\18] of Cambridge, has investigated in a much more\r\ngeneral manner, upon mechanical principles, the laws of the\r\nelevations, fissures, faults, veins, and other phenomena which would\r\nresult from an elevatory force, acting simultaneously at every point\r\nbeneath extensive portions of the crust of the earth. An application\r\nof mathematical reasoning to the illustration of the phenomena of\r\nveins had before been made in Germany by Schmidt and\r\nZimmerman.[73\\18] The conclusion which Mr. Hopkins has obtained,\r\nrespecting the two sets of fissures, at right angles to each other,\r\nwhich would in general be produced by such forces as he supposes,\r\nmay suggest interesting points of examination respecting the\r\ngeological phenomena of fissured districts.\r\n\r\n[Note 72\\18: _Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc._ vol. vi. 1836.]\r\n\r\n[Note 73\\18:  _Phil. Mag._ July, 1836, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The theory of craters of elevation probably errs rather\r\nby making the elevation of a point into a particular class of\r\nvolcanic agency, than by giving volcanic agency too great a power of\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nA mature consideration of the subject will make us hesitate to\r\nascribe much value to the labors of those writers who have applied\r\nmathematical reasoning to geological questions. Such reasoning, when\r\nit is carried to the extent which requires symbolical processes, has\r\nalways been, I conceive, a source, not of knowledge, but of error,\r\nand confusion; for in such applications the real questions are\r\nslurred over in the hypothetical assumptions of the mathematician,\r\nwhile the calculation misleads its followers by a false aspect of\r\ndemonstration. All symbolical reasonings concerning the fissures of\r\na semi-rigid mass produced by elevatory or other forces, appear to\r\nme to have turned out valueless. At the same time it cannot be too\r\nstrongly borne in mind, that mathematical and mechanical habits of\r\nthought are requisite to all clear thinking on such subjects.]\r\n\r\nOther forces, still more secure in their nature and laws, have\r\nplayed a very important part in the formation of the earth's crust.\r\nI speak of the forces by which the crystalline, slaty, and jointed\r\nstructure of {558} mineral masses has been produced. These forces\r\nare probably identical, on the one hand, with the cohesive forces\r\nfrom which rocks derive their solidity and their physical\r\nproperties; while, on the other hand, they are closely connected\r\nwith the forces of chemical attraction. No attempts, of any lucid\r\nand hopeful kind, have yet been made to bring such forces under\r\ndefinite mechanical conceptions: and perhaps mineralogy, to which\r\nscience, as the point of junction of chemistry and crystallography,\r\nsuch attempts would belong, is hardly yet ripe for such\r\nspeculations. But when we look at the universal prevalence of\r\ncrystalline forms and cleavages, at the extent of the phenomena of\r\nslaty cleavage, and at the _segregation_ of special minerals into\r\nveins and nodules, which has taken place in some unknown manner, we\r\ncannot doubt that the forces of which we now speak have acted very\r\nwidely and energetically. Any elucidation of their nature would be\r\nan important step in Geological Dynamics.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [A point of Geological Dynamics of great importance is, the\r\nchange which rocks undergo in structure after they are deposited,\r\neither by the action of subterraneous heat, or by the influence of\r\ncrystalline or other corpuscular forces. By such agencies, sedimentary\r\nrocks may be converted into crystalline, the traces of organic fossils\r\nmay be obliterated, a slaty cleavage may be produced, and other like\r\neffects. The possibility of such changes was urged by Dr. Hutton in\r\nhis Theory; and Sir James Hall's very instructive and striking\r\nexperiments were made for the purpose of illustrating this theory. In\r\nthese experiments, powdered chalk was, by the application of heat\r\nunder pressure, converted into crystalline calcspar. Afterwards Dr.\r\nMcCulloch's labors had an important influence in satisfying geologists\r\nof the reality of corresponding changes in nature. Dr. McCulloch, by\r\nhis very lively and copious descriptions of volcanic regions, by his\r\nrepresentations of them, by his classification of igneous rocks, and\r\nhis comprehensive views of the phenomena which they exhibit, probably\r\nwas the means of converting many geologists from the Wernerian\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nRocks which have undergone changes since they were deposited are\r\ntermed by Mr. Lyell _metamorphic_. The great extent of metamorphic\r\nrock changed by heat is now uncontested. The internal changes which\r\nare produced by the crystalline forces of mountain masses have been\r\nthe subjects of important and comprehensive speculations by\r\nProfessor Sedgwick.] {559}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_Theories of Changes of Climate._\r\n\r\nAS we have already stated, Geology offers to us strong evidence that\r\nthe climate of the ancient periods of the earth's history was hotter\r\nthan that which now exists in the same countries. This, and other\r\ncircumstances, have led geologists to the investigation of the\r\neffects of any hypothetical causes of such changes of condition in\r\nrespect of heat.\r\n\r\nThe love of the contemplation of geometrical symmetry, as well as\r\nother reasons, suggested the hypothesis that the earth's axis had\r\noriginally no obliquity, but was perpendicular to the equator. Such\r\na construction of the world had been thought of before the time of\r\nMilton,[74\\18] as what might be supposed to have existed when man\r\nwas expelled from Paradise; and Burnet, in his _Sacred Theory of the\r\nEarth_ (1690), adopted this notion of the paradisiacal condition of\r\nthe globe:\r\n                 The spring\r\n  Perpetual smiled on earth with verdant flowers,\r\n  Equal in days and nights.\r\n\r\n[Note 74\\18: Some said he bade his angels turn askance\r\n             The poles of earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n             From the sun's axle, &c.--_Paradise Lost_, x. 214.]\r\n\r\nIn modern times, too, some persons have been disposed to adopt this\r\nhypothesis, because they have conceived that the present polar\r\ndistribution of light is inconsistent with the production of the\r\nfossil plants which are found in those regions,[75\\18] even if we\r\ncould, in some other way, account for the change of temperature. But\r\nthis alteration in the axes of a revolution could not take place\r\nwithout a subversion of the equilibrium of the surface, such as does\r\nnot appear to have occurred; and the change has of late been\r\ngenerally declared impossible by physical astronomers.\r\n\r\n[Note 75\\18: Lyell, i. 155. Lindley, _Fossil Flora_.]\r\n\r\nThe effects of other astronomical changes have been calculated by\r\nSir John Herschel. He has examined, for instance, the thermotical\r\nconsequences of the diminution of the eccentricity of the earth's\r\norbit, which has been going on for ages beyond the records of\r\nhistory. He finds[76\\18] that, on this account, the annual effect of\r\nsolar radiation would increase as we go back to remoter periods of\r\nthe past; but (probably at least) not in a degree sufficient to\r\naccount for the apparent past {560} changes of climate. He finds,\r\nhowever, that though the effect of this change on the mean\r\ntemperature of the year may be small, the effect on the extreme\r\ntemperature of the seasons will be much more considerable; \"so as to\r\nproduce alternately, in the same latitude of either hemisphere, a\r\nperpetual spring, or the extreme vicissitudes of a burning summer\r\nand a rigorous winter.\"[77\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 76\\18: _Geol. Trans._ vol. iii. p. 295.]\r\n\r\n[Note 77\\18: _Geol. Trans._ vol. iii. p. 298.]\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell has traced the consequences of another hypothesis on this\r\nsubject, which appears at first sight to promise no very striking\r\nresults, but which yet is found, upon examination, to involve\r\nadequate causes of very great changes: I refer to the supposed\r\nvarious distribution of land and water at different periods of the\r\nearth's history. If the land were all gathered into the neighborhood\r\nof the poles, it would become the seat of constant ice and snow, and\r\nwould thus very greatly reduce the temperature of the whole surface\r\nof the globe. If, on the other hand, the polar regions were\r\nprincipally water, while the tropics were occupied with a belt of\r\nland, there would be no part of the earth's surface on which the\r\nfrost could fasten a firm hold, while the torrid zone would act like\r\na furnace to heat the whole. And, supposing a cycle of terrestrial\r\nchanges in which these conditions should succeed each other, the\r\nwinter and summer of this \"great year\" might differ much more than\r\nthe elevated temperature which we are led to ascribe to former\r\nperiods of the globe, can be judged to have differed from the\r\npresent state of things.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity and plausibility of this theory cannot be doubted: and\r\nperhaps its results may hereafter be found not quite out of the\r\nreach of calculation. Some progress has already been made in\r\ncalculating the movement of heat into, through, and out of the\r\nearth; but when we add to this the effects of the currents of the\r\nocean and the atmosphere, the problem, thus involving so many\r\nthermotical and atmological laws, operating under complex\r\nconditions, is undoubtedly one of extreme difficulty. Still, it is\r\nsomething, in this as in all cases, to have the problem even stated;\r\nand none of the elements of the solution appears to be of such a\r\nnature that we need allow ourselves to yield to despair, respecting\r\nthe possibility of dealing with it in a useful manner, as our\r\nknowledge becomes more complete and definite. {561}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE GEOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF ORGANIZED BEINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Objects of this Science._\r\n\r\nPERHAPS in extending the term _Geological Dynamics_ to the causes of\r\nchanges in organized beings, I shall be thought to be employing a\r\nforced and inconvenient phraseology. But it will be found that, in\r\norder to treat geology in a truly scientific manner, we must bring\r\ntogether all the classes of speculations concerning known causes of\r\nchange; and the Organic Dynamics of Geology, or of Geography, if the\r\nreader prefers the word, appears not an inappropriate phrase for one\r\npart of this body of researches.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, the species of plants and animals which\r\nare found embedded in the strata of the earth, are not only\r\ndifferent from those which now live in the same regions, but, for\r\nthe most part, different from any now existing on the face of the\r\nearth. The remains which we discover imply a past state of things\r\ndifferent from that which now prevails; they imply also that the\r\nwhole organic creation has been renewed, and that this renewal has\r\ntaken place several times. Such extraordinary general facts have\r\nnaturally put in activity very bold speculations.\r\n\r\nBut it has already been said, we cannot speculate upon such facts in\r\nthe past history of the globe, without taking a large survey of its\r\npresent condition. Does the present animal and vegetable population\r\ndiffer from the past, in the same way in which the products of one\r\nregion of the existing earth differ from those of another? Can the\r\ncreation and diffusion of the fossil species be explained in the\r\nsame manner as the creation and diffusion of the creatures among\r\nwhich we live? And these questions lead us onwards another step, to\r\nask,--What _are_ the laws by which the plants and animals of\r\ndifferent parts of the earth differ? What was the manner in which\r\nthey were originally diffused?--Thus we have to include, as portions\r\nof our subject, {562} the _Geography of Plants_, and _of Animals_,\r\nand the _History of their change and diffusion_; intending by the\r\nlatter subject, of course, _palætiological_ history,--the\r\nexamination of the causes of what has occurred, and the inference of\r\npast events, from what we know of causes.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary for me to give at any length a statement of the\r\nproblems which are included in these branches of science, or of the\r\nprogress which has been made in them; since Mr. Lyell, in his\r\n_Principles of Geology_, has treated these subjects in a very able\r\nmanner, and in the same point of view in which I am thus led to\r\nconsider them. I will only briefly refer to some points, availing\r\nmyself of his labors and his ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Geography of Plants and Animals._\r\n\r\nWITH regard both to plants and animals, it appears,[78\\18] that\r\nbesides such differences in the products of different regions as we\r\nmay naturally suppose to be occasioned by climate and other external\r\ncauses; an examination of the whole organic population of the globe\r\nleads us to consider the earth as divided into _provinces_, each\r\nprovince being occupied by its own group of species, and these\r\ngroups not being mixed or interfused among each other to any great\r\nextent. And thus, as the earth is occupied by various nations of\r\nmen, each appearing at first sight to be of a different stock, so\r\neach other tribe of living things is scattered over the ground in a\r\nsimilar manner, and distributed into its separate _nations_ in\r\ndistant countries. The places where species are thus peculiarly\r\nfound, are, in the case of plants, called their _stations_. Yet each\r\nspecies in its own region loves and selects some peculiar conditions\r\nof shade or exposure, soil or moisture: its place, defined by the\r\ngeneral description of such conditions, is called its _habitation_.\r\n\r\n[Note 78\\18: Lyell, _Principles_, B. iii. c. v.]\r\n\r\nNot only each species thus placed in its own province, has its\r\nposition further fixed by its own habits, but more general groups\r\nand assemblages are found to be determined in their situation by\r\nmore general conditions. Thus it is the character of the _flora_ of\r\na collection of islands, scattered through a wide ocean in a\r\ntropical and humid climate, to contain an immense preponderance of\r\ntree-ferns. In the same way, the situation and depth at which\r\ncertain genera of shells are found have been tabulated[79\\18] by Mr.\r\nBroderip. Such general inferences, if {563} they can be securely\r\nmade, are of extreme interest in their bearing on geological\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\n[Note 79\\18: Greenough, _Add._ 1835, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe means by which plants and animals are now diffused from one\r\nplace to another, have been well described by Mr. Lyell.[80\\18] And\r\nhe has considered also, with due attention, the manner in which they\r\nbecome imbedded in mineral deposits of various kinds.[81\\18] He has\r\nthus followed the history of organized bodies, from the germ to the\r\ntomb, and thence to the cabinet of the geologist.\r\n\r\n[Note 80\\18: Lyell, B. iii. c. v. vi. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 81\\18: B. iii. c. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi.]\r\n\r\nBut, besides the fortunes of individual plants and animals, there is\r\nanother class of questions, of great interest, but of great\r\ndifficulty;--the fortunes of each species. In what manner do species\r\nwhich were not, begin to be? as geology teaches us that they many\r\ntimes have done; and, as even our own reasonings convince us they must\r\nhave done, at least in the case of the species among which we live.\r\n\r\nWe here obviously place before us, as a subject of research, the\r\nCreation of Living Things;--a subject shrouded in mystery, and not\r\nto be approached without reverence. But though we may conceive,\r\nthat, on this subject, we are not to seek our belief from science\r\nalone, we shall find, it is asserted, within the limits of allowable\r\nand unavoidable speculation, many curious and important problems\r\nwhich may well employ our physiological skill. For example, we may\r\nask:--how we are to recognize the species which were originally\r\ncreated distinct?--whether the population of the earth at one\r\ngeological epoch could pass to the form which it has at a succeeding\r\nperiod, by the agency of natural causes alone?--and if not, what\r\nother account we can give of the succession which we find to have\r\ntaken place?\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable point in the attempts to answer these and the\r\nlike questions, is the controversy between the advocates and the\r\nopponents of the doctrine of the _transmutation of species_. This\r\nquestion is, even from its mere physiological import, one of great\r\ninterest; and the interest is much enhanced by our geological\r\nresearches, which again bring the question before us in a striking\r\nform, and on a gigantic scale. We shall, therefore, briefly state\r\nthe point at issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Question of the Transmutation of Species._\r\n\r\nWE see that animals and plants may, by the influence of breeding,\r\nand of external agents operating upon their constitution, be greatly\r\n{564} modified, so as to give rise to varieties and races different\r\nfrom what before existed. How different, for instance, is one kind\r\nand breed of dog from another! The question, then, is, whether\r\norganized beings can, by the mere working of natural causes, pass\r\nfrom the type of one species to that of another? whether the wolf\r\nmay, by domestication, become the dog? whether the ourang-outang\r\nmay, by the power of external circumstances, be brought within the\r\ncircle of the human species? And the dilemma in which we are placed\r\nis this;--that if species are not thus interchangeable, we must\r\nsuppose the fluctuations of which each species is capable, and which\r\nare apparently indefinite, to be bounded by rigorous limits;\r\nwhereas, if we allow such a _transmutation of species_, we abandon\r\nthat belief in the adaptation of the structure of every creature to\r\nits destined mode of being, which not only most persons would give\r\nup with repugnance, but which, as we have seen, has constantly and\r\nirresistibly impressed itself on the minds of the best naturalists,\r\nas the true view of the order of the world.\r\n\r\nBut the study of Geology opens to us the spectacle of many groups of\r\nspecies which have, in the course of the earth's history, succeeded\r\neach other at vast intervals of time; one set of animals and plants\r\ndisappearing, as it would seem, from the face of our planet, and\r\nothers, which did not before exist, becoming the only occupants of\r\nthe globe. And the dilemma then presents itself to us anew:--either\r\nwe must accept the doctrine of the transmutation of species, and\r\nmust suppose that the organized species of one geological epoch were\r\ntransmuted into those of another by some long-continued agency of\r\nnatural causes; or else, we must believe in many successive acts of\r\ncreation and extinction of species, out of the common course of\r\nnature; acts which, therefore, we may properly call miraculous.\r\n\r\nThis latter dilemma, however, is a question concerning the facts\r\nwhich have happened in the history of the world; the deliberation\r\nrespecting it belongs to physical geology itself, and not to that\r\nsubsidiary science which we are now describing, and which is\r\nconcerned only with such causes as we know to be in constant and\r\norderly action.\r\n\r\nThe former question, of the limited or unlimited extent of the\r\nmodifications of animals and plants, has received full and careful\r\nconsideration from eminent physiologists; and in their opinions we\r\nfind, I think, an indisputable preponderance to that decision which\r\nrejects the transmutation of species, and which accepts the former\r\nside of the dilemma; namely, that the changes of which each species\r\nis {565} susceptible, though difficult to define in words, are\r\nlimited in fact. It is extremely interesting and satisfactory thus\r\nto receive an answer in which we can confide, to inquiries seemingly\r\nso wide and bold as those which this subject involves. I refer to\r\nMr. Lyell, Dr. Prichard, Mr. Lawrence, and others, for the history\r\nof the discussion, and for the grounds of the decision; and I shall\r\nquote very briefly the main points and conclusions to which the\r\ninquiry has led.[82\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 82\\18: Lyell, B. iii. c. iv.]\r\n\r\nIt may be considered, then, as determined by the over-balance of\r\nphysiological authority, that there is a capacity in all species to\r\naccommodate themselves, to a certain extent, to a change of external\r\ncircumstances; this extent varying greatly according to the species.\r\nThere may thus arise changes of appearance or structure, and some of\r\nthese changes are transmissible to the offspring: but the mutations\r\nthus superinduced are governed by constant laws, and confined within\r\ncertain limits. Indefinite divergence from the original type is not\r\npossible; and the extreme limit of possible variation may usually be\r\nreached in a brief period of time: in short, _species have a real\r\nexistence in nature_, and a transmutation from one to another does\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, Cuvier remarks, that notwithstanding all the\r\ndifferences of size, appearance, and habits, which we find in the dogs\r\nof various races and countries, and though we have (in the Egyptian\r\nmummies) skeletons of this animal as it existed three thousand years\r\nago, the relation of the bones to each other remains essentially the\r\nsame; and, with all the varieties of their shape[83\\18] and size,\r\nthere are characters which resist all the influences both of external\r\nnature, of human intercourse, and of time.\r\n\r\n[Note 83\\18:  _Ossem. Foss._ Disc. Prél. p. 61.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Hypothesis of Progressive Tendencies._\r\n\r\nWITHIN certain limits, however, as we have said, external\r\ncircumstances produce changes in the forms of organized beings. The\r\ncauses of change, and the laws and limits of their effects, as they\r\nobtain in the existing state of the organic creation, are in the\r\nhighest degree interesting. And, as has been already intimated, the\r\nknowledge thus obtained, has been applied with a view to explain the\r\norigin of the existing population of the world, and the succession\r\nof its past conditions. But those who have attempted such an\r\nexplanation, have found it necessary to assume certain additional\r\nlaws, in order to enable themselves to {566} deduce, from the tenet\r\nof the transmutability of the species of organized beings, such a\r\nstate of things as we see about us, and such a succession of states\r\nas is evidenced by geological researches. And here, again, we are\r\nbrought to questions of which we must seek the answers from the most\r\nprofound physiologists. Now referring, as before, to those which\r\nappear to be the best authorities, it is found that these additional\r\npositive laws are still more inadmissible than the primary\r\nassumption of indefinite capacity of change. For example, in order\r\nto account, on this hypothesis, for the seeming adaptation of the\r\nendowments of animals to their wants, it is held that the endowments\r\nare the result of the wants; that the swiftness of the antelope, the\r\nclaws and teeth of the lion, the trunk of the elephant, the long\r\nneck of the giraffe have been produced by a certain plastic\r\ncharacter in the constitution of animals, operated upon, for a long\r\ncourse of ages, by the attempts which these animals made to attain\r\nobjects which their previous organization did not place within their\r\nreach. In this way, it is maintained that the most striking\r\nattributes of animals, those which apparently imply most clearly the\r\nproviding skill of their Creator, have been brought forth by the\r\nlong-repeated efforts of the creatures to attain the object of their\r\ndesire; thus animals with the highest endowments have been gradually\r\ndeveloped from ancestral forms of the most limited organization;\r\nthus fish, bird, and beast, have grown from _small gelatinous\r\nbodies_, \"petits corps gelatineux,\" possessing some obscure\r\nprinciple of life, and the capacity of development; and thus man\r\nhimself with all his intellectual and moral, as well as physical\r\nprivileges, has been derived from some creature of the ape or baboon\r\ntribe, urged by a constant tendency to improve, or at least to alter\r\nhis condition.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, in order to arrive even hypothetically at this\r\nresult, it is necessary to assume besides a mere capacity for\r\nchange, other positive and active principles, some of which we may\r\nnotice. Thus, we must have as the direct productions of nature on\r\nthis hypothesis, certain monads or rough draughts, the primary\r\n_rudiments_ of plants and animals. We must have, in these, a\r\nconstant _tendency to progressive improvement_, to the attainment of\r\nhigher powers and faculties than they possess; which tendency is\r\nagain perpetually modified and controlled by the _force of external\r\ncircumstances_. And in order to account for the simultaneous\r\nexistence of animals in every stage of this imaginary progress, we\r\nmust suppose that nature is compelled to be _constantly_ producing\r\nthose elementary beings, from which all animals are successively\r\ndeveloped. {567}\r\n\r\nI need not stay to point out how extremely arbitrary every part of\r\nthis scheme is; and how complex its machinery would be, even if it\r\ndid account for the facts. It may be sufficient to observe, as\r\nothers have done,[84\\18] that the capacity of change, and of being\r\ninfluenced by external circumstances, such as we really find it in\r\nnature, and therefore such as in science we must represent it, is a\r\ntendency, not to improve, but to deteriorate. When species are\r\nmodified by external causes, they usually degenerate, and do not\r\nadvance. And there is no instance of a species acquiring an entirely\r\nnew sense, faculty, or organ, in addition to, or in the place of,\r\nwhat it had before.\r\n\r\n[Note 84\\18: Lyell, B. III. c. iv.]\r\n\r\nNot only, then, is the doctrine of the transmutation of species in\r\nitself disproved by the best physiological reasonings, but the\r\nadditional assumptions which are requisite, to enable its advocates\r\nto apply it to the explanation of the geological and other phenomena\r\nof the earth, are altogether gratuitous and fantastical.\r\n\r\nSuch is the judgment to which we are led by the examination of the\r\ndiscussions which have taken place on this subject. Yet in certain\r\nspeculations, occasioned by the discovery of the _Sivatherium_, a\r\nnew fossil animal from the Sub-Himalaya mountains of India, M.\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire speaks of the belief in the immutability of\r\nspecies as a conviction which is fading away from men's minds. He\r\nspeaks too of the termination of the age of Cuvier, \"la clôture du\r\nsiècle de Cuvier,\" and of the commencement of a better zoological\r\nphilosophy.[85\\18] But though he expresses himself with great\r\nanimation, I do not perceive that he adduces, in support of his\r\npeculiar opinions, any arguments in addition to those which he urged\r\nduring the lifetime of Cuvier. And the reader[86\\18] may recollect\r\nthat the consideration of that controversy led us to very different\r\nanticipations from his, respecting the probable future progress of\r\nphysiology. The discovery of the Sivatherium supplies no particle of\r\nproof to the hypothesis, that the existing species of animals are\r\ndescended from extinct creatures which are specifically distinct:\r\nand we cannot act more wisely than in listening to the advice of\r\nthat eminent naturalist, M. de Blainville.[87\\18] \"Against this\r\nhypothesis, which, up to the present time, I regard as purely\r\ngratuitous, and likely to turn geologists out of the sound and\r\nexcellent road in which they now are, I willingly raise my voice,\r\nwith the most absolute conviction of being in the right.\" {568}\r\n\r\n[Note 85\\18: _Compte Rendu de l'Acad. des Sc._ 1837, No. 3, p. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Note 86\\18: See B. XVII. c. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Note 87\\18: _Compte Rendu_, 1837, No. 5, p. 168.]\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [The hypothesis of the progressive developement of species\r\nhas been urged recently, in connexion with the physiological tenet\r\nof Tiedemann and De Serres, noticed in B.

Assuming this tenet as exact, it has been maintained that\r\nthe higher animals which are found in the more recent strata may\r\nhave been produced by an ulterior development of the lower forms in\r\nthe embryo state; the circumstances being such as to favor such a\r\ndevelopement. But all the best physiologists agree in declaring that\r\nsuch an extraordinary developement of the embryo is inconsistent\r\nwith physiological possibility. Even if the progression of the\r\nembryo in time have a general correspondence with the order of\r\nanimal forms as more or less perfectly organized (which is true in\r\nan extremely incomplete and inexact degree), this correspondence\r\nmust be considered, not as any indication of causality, but as one\r\nof those marks of universal analogy and symmetry which are stamped\r\nupon every part of the creation.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell[88\\18] notices this doctrine of Tiedemann and De Serres;\r\nand observes, that though nature presents us with cases of animal\r\nforms degraded by incomplete developement, she offers none of forms\r\nexalted by extraordinary developement. Mr. Lyell's own hypothesis of\r\nthe introduction of new species upon the earth, not having any\r\nphysiological basis, hardly belongs to this chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Note 88\\18: _Principles_, B. III. c. iv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Question of Creation as related to Science._\r\n\r\nBUT since we reject the production of new species by means of\r\nexternal influence, do we then, it may be asked, accept the other\r\nside of the dilemma which we have stated; and admit a series of\r\ncreations of species, by some power beyond that which we trace in\r\nthe ordinary course of nature?\r\n\r\nTo this question, the history and analogy of science, I conceive,\r\nteach us to reply as follows:--All palætiological sciences, all\r\nspeculations which attempt to ascend from the present to the remote\r\npast, by the chain of causation, do also, by an inevitable\r\nconsequence, urge us to look for the beginning of the state of\r\nthings which we thus contemplate; but in none of these cases have\r\nmen been able, by the aid of science, to arrive at a beginning which\r\nis homogeneous with the {569} known course of events. The first\r\norigin of language, of civilization, of law and government, cannot\r\nbe clearly made out by reasoning and research; just as little, we\r\nmay expect, will a knowledge of the origin of the existing and\r\nextinct species of plants and animals, be the result of\r\nphysiological and geological investigation.\r\n\r\nBut, though philosophers have never yet demonstrated, and perhaps\r\nnever will be able to demonstrate, what was that primitive state of\r\nthings in the social and material worlds, from which the progressive\r\nstate took its first departure; they can still, in all the lines of\r\nresearch to which we have referred, go very far back;--determine many\r\nof the remote circumstances of the past sequence of events;--ascend to\r\na point which, from our position at least, seems to be near the\r\norigin;--and exclude many suppositions respecting the origin itself.\r\nWhether, by the light of reason alone, men will ever be able to do\r\nmore than this, it is difficult to say. It is, I think, no irrational\r\nopinion, even on grounds of philosophical analogy alone, that in all\r\nthose sciences which look back and seek a beginning of things, we may\r\nbe unable to arrive at a consistent and definite belief, without\r\nhaving recourse to other grounds of truth, as well as to historical\r\nresearch and scientific reasoning. When our thoughts would apprehend\r\nsteadily the creation of things, we find that we are obliged to summon\r\nup other ideas than those which regulate the pursuit of scientific\r\ntruths;--to call in other powers than those to which we refer natural\r\nevents: it cannot, then, be considered as very surprizing, if, in this\r\npart of our inquiry, we are compelled to look for other than the\r\nordinary evidence of science.\r\n\r\nGeology, forming one of the palætiological class of sciences, which\r\ntrace back the history of the earth and its inhabitants on\r\nphilosophical grounds, is thus associated with a number of other\r\nkinds of research, which are concerned about language, law, art, and\r\nconsequently about the internal faculties of man, his thoughts, his\r\nsocial habits, his conception of right, his love of beauty. Geology\r\nbeing thus brought into the atmosphere of moral and mental\r\nspeculations, it may be expected that her investigations of the\r\nprobable past will share an influence common to them; and that she\r\nwill not be allowed to point to an origin of her own, a merely\r\nphysical beginning of things; but that, as she approaches towards\r\nsuch a goal, she will be led to see that it is the origin of many\r\ntrains of events, the point of convergence of many lines. It may be,\r\nthat instead of being allowed to travel up to this focus of being,\r\nwe are only able to estimate its place and nature, and {570} to form\r\nof it such a judgment as this;--that it is not only the source of\r\nmere vegetable and animal life, but also of rational and social\r\nlife, language and arts, law and order; in short, of all the\r\nprogressive tendencies by which the highest principles of the\r\nintellectual and moral world have been and are developed, as well as\r\nof the succession of organic forms, which we find scattered, dead or\r\nliving, over the earth.\r\n\r\nThis reflection concerning the natural scientific view of creation,\r\nit will be observed, has not been sought for, from a wish to arrive\r\nat such conclusions; but it has flowed spontaneously from the manner\r\nin which we have had to introduce geology into our classification of\r\nthe sciences; and this classification was framed from an unbiassed\r\nconsideration of the general analogies and guiding ideas of the\r\nvarious portions of our knowledge. Such remarks as we have made may\r\non this account be considered more worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nBut such a train of thought must be pursued with caution. Although\r\nit may not be possible to arrive at a right conviction respecting\r\nthe origin of the world, without having recourse to other than\r\nphysical considerations, and to other than geological evidence: yet\r\nextraneous considerations, and extraneous evidence, respecting the\r\nnature of the beginning of things, must never be allowed to\r\ninfluence our physics or our geology. Our geological dynamics, like\r\nour astronomical dynamics, may be inadequate to carry us back to an\r\norigin of that state of things, of which it explains the progress:\r\nbut this deficiency must be supplied, not by adding supernatural to\r\nnatural geological dynamics, but by accepting, in their proper\r\nplace, the views supplied by a portion of knowledge of a different\r\ncharacter and order. If we include in our Theology the speculations\r\nto which we have recourse for this purpose, we must exclude from\r\nthem our Geology. The two sciences may conspire, not by having any\r\npart in common: but because, though widely diverse in their lines,\r\nboth point to a mysterious and invisible origin of the world.\r\n\r\nAll that which claims our assent on those higher grounds of which\r\ntheology takes cognizance, must claim such assent as is consistent\r\nwith those grounds; that is, it must require belief in respect of\r\nall that bears upon the highest relations of our being, those on\r\nwhich depend our duties and our hopes. Doctrines of this kind may\r\nand must be conveyed and maintained, by means of information\r\nconcerning the past history of man, and his social and material, as\r\nwell as moral and spiritual fortunes. He who believes that a\r\nProvidence has {571} ruled the affairs of mankind, will also believe\r\nthat a Providence has governed the material world. But any language\r\nin which the narrative of this government of the material world can\r\nbe conveyed, must necessarily be very imperfect and inappropriate;\r\nbeing expressed in terms of those ideas which have been selected by\r\nmen, in order to describe appearances and relations of created\r\nthings as they affect one another. In all cases, therefore, where we\r\nhave to attempt to interpret such a narrative, we must feel that we\r\nare extremely liable to err; and most of all, when our\r\ninterpretation refers to those material objects and operations which\r\nare most foreign to the main purpose of a history of providence. If\r\nwe have to consider a communication containing a view of such a\r\ngovernment of the world, imparted to us, as we may suppose, in order\r\nto point out the right direction for our feelings of trust, and\r\nreverence, and hope, towards the Governor of the world, we may\r\nexpect that we shall be in no danger of collecting from our\r\nauthority erroneous notions with regard to the power, and wisdom,\r\nand goodness of His government; or with respect to our own place,\r\nduties, and prospects, and the history of our race so far as our\r\nduties and prospects are concerned. But that we shall rightly\r\nunderstand the detail of all events in the history of man, or of the\r\nskies, or of the earth, which are narrated for the purpose of thus\r\ngiving a right direction to our minds, is by no means equally\r\ncertain; and I do not think it would be too much to say, that an\r\nimmunity from perplexity and error, in such matters, is, on general\r\ngrounds, very improbable. It cannot then surprise us to find, that\r\nparts of such narrations which seem to refer to occurrences like\r\nthose of which astronomers and geologists have attempted to\r\ndetermine the laws, have given rise to many interpretations, all\r\ninconsistent with one another, and most of them at variance with the\r\nbest established principles of astronomy and geology.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, that all truths must be consistent with all other\r\ntruths, and that therefore the results of true geology or astronomy\r\ncannot be irreconcileable with the statements of true theology. And\r\nthis universal consistency of truth with itself must be assented to;\r\nbut it by no means follows that we must be able to obtain a full\r\ninsight into the nature and manner of such a consistency. Such an\r\ninsight would only be possible if we could obtain a clear view of\r\nthat central body of truth, the source of the principles which\r\nappear in the separate lines of speculation. To expect that we\r\nshould see clearly how the providential government of the world is\r\nconsistent with the unvarying laws {572} by which its motions and\r\ndevelopements are regulated, is to expect to understand thoroughly\r\nthe laws of motion, of developement, and of providence; it is to\r\nexpect that we may ascend from geology and astronomy to the creative\r\nand legislative centre, from which proceeded earth and stars; and\r\nthen descend again into the moral and spiritual world, because its\r\nsource and centre are the same as those of the material creation. It\r\nis to say that reason, whether finite or infinite, must be\r\nconsistent with itself; and that, therefore, the finite must be able\r\nto comprehend the infinite, to travel from any one province of the\r\nmoral and material universe to any other, to trace their bearing,\r\nand to connect their boundaries.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of the study of the history and nature of\r\nscience in which we are now engaged is, that it warns us of the\r\nhopeless and presumptuous character of such attempts to understand\r\nthe government of the world by the aid of science, without throwing\r\nany discredit upon the reality of our knowledge;--that while it\r\nshows how solid and certain each science is, so long as it refers\r\nits own facts to its own ideas, it confines each science within its\r\nown limits, and condemns it as empty and helpless, when it\r\npronounces upon those subjects which are extraneous to it. The error\r\nof persons who should seek a geological narrative in theological\r\nrecords, would be rather in the search itself than in their\r\ninterpretation of what they might find; and in like manner the error\r\nof those who would conclude against a supernatural beginning, or a\r\nprovidential direction of the world, upon geological or\r\nphysiological reasonings, would be, that they had expected those\r\nsciences alone to place the origin or the government of the world in\r\nits proper light.\r\n\r\nThough these observations apply generally to all the palætiological\r\nsciences, they may be permitted here, because they have an especial\r\nbearing upon some of the difficulties which have embarrassed the\r\nprogress of geological speculation; and though such difficulties\r\nare, I trust, nearly gone by, it is important for us to see them in\r\ntheir true bearing.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it follows that geology and astronomy are,\r\nof themselves, incapable of giving us any distinct and satisfactory\r\naccount of the origin of the universe, or of its parts. We need not\r\nwonder, then, at any particular instance of this incapacity; as, for\r\nexample, that of which we have been speaking, the impossibility of\r\naccounting by any natural means for the production of all the\r\nsuccessive tribes of plants and animals which have peopled the world\r\nin the {573} various stages of its progress, as geology teaches us.\r\nThat they were, like our own animal and vegetable contemporaries,\r\nprofoundly adapted to the condition in which they were placed, we\r\nhave ample reason to believe; but when we inquire whence they came\r\ninto this our world, geology is silent. The mystery of creation is\r\nnot within the range of her legitimate territory; she says nothing,\r\nbut she points upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 6.--_The Hypothesis of the regular Creation and Extinction\r\nof Species._\r\n\r\n1. _Creation of Species._--We have already seen, how untenable, as a\r\nphysiological doctrine, is the principle of the transmutability and\r\nprogressive tendency of species; and therefore, when we come to\r\napply to theoretical geology the principles of the present chapter,\r\nthis portion of the subject will easily be disposed of. I hardly\r\nknow whether I can state that there is any other principle which has\r\nbeen applied to the solution of the geological problem, and which,\r\ntherefore, as a general truth, ought to be considered here. Mr.\r\nLyell, indeed, has spoken[89\\18] of an hypothesis that \"the\r\nsuccessive creation of species may constitute a regular part of the\r\neconomy of nature:\" but he has nowhere, I think, so described this\r\nprocess as to make it appear in what department of science we are to\r\nplace the hypothesis. Are these new species created by the\r\nproduction, at long intervals, of an offspring different in species\r\nfrom the parents? Or are the species so created produced without\r\nparents? Are they gradually evolved from some embryo substance? or\r\ndo they suddenly start from the ground, as in the creation of the\r\npoet?\r\n  . . . . . . . Perfect forms\r\n  Limbed and full-grown: out of the ground up rose\r\n  As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons\r\n  In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; . . .\r\n  The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared\r\n  The tawny lion, pawing to get free\r\n  His hinder parts; then springs as broke from bounds,\r\n  And rampant shakes his brinded mane; &c. &c.\r\n          _Paradise Lost_, B. vii.\r\n\r\n[Note 89\\18: B. III. c. xi. p. 234.]\r\n\r\nSome selection of one of these forms of the hypothesis, rather than\r\nthe others, with evidence for the selection, is requisite to entitle\r\nus to {574} place it among the known causes of change which in this\r\nchapter we are considering. The bare conviction that a creation of\r\nspecies has taken place, whether once or many times, so long as it\r\nis unconnected with our organical sciences, is a tenet of Natural\r\nTheology rather than of Physical Philosophy.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [Mr. Lyell has explained his theory[90\\18] by supposing\r\nman to people a great desert, introducing into it living plants and\r\nanimals: and he has traced, in a very interesting manner, the\r\nresults of such a hypothesis on the distribution of vegetable and\r\nanimal species. But he supposes the agents who do this, before they\r\nimport species into particular localities, to study attentively the\r\nclimate and other physical conditions of each spot, and to use\r\nvarious precautions. It is on account of the notion of design thus\r\nintroduced that I have, above, described this opinion as rather a\r\ntenet of Natural Theology than of Physical Philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Note 90\\18: B. III. c. viii. p. 166.]\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Forbes has published some highly interesting speculations\r\non the distribution of existing species of animals and plants. It\r\nappears that the manner in which animal and vegetable forms are now\r\ndiffused requires us to assume centres from which the diffusion took\r\nplace by no means limited by the present divisions of continents and\r\nislands. The changes of land and water which have thus occurred\r\nsince the existing species were placed on the earth must have been\r\nvery extensive, and perhaps reach into the glacial period of which I\r\nhave spoken above.[91\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 91\\18: See, in _Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great\r\nBritain_, vol. i. p. 336, Professor Forbes's Memoir \"On the\r\nConnection between the Distribution of the existing Fauna and Flora\r\nof the British Isles, and the Geological Changes which have affected\r\ntheir area, especially during the epoch of the Northern Drift.\"]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Forbes's views, for which he has offered a great\r\nbody of very striking and converging reasons, the present vegetable\r\nand animal population of the British Isles is to be accounted for by\r\nthe following series of events. The marine deposits of the\r\n_meiocine_ formation were elevated into a great Atlantic continent,\r\nyet separate from what is now America, and having its western shore\r\nwhere now the great semi-circular belt of gulf-weed ranges from the\r\n15th to the 45th parallel of latitude. This continent then became\r\nstocked with life, and of its vegetable population, the flora of the\r\nwest of Ireland, which has many points in common with the flora of\r\nSpain and the {575} Atlantic islands (the _Asturian_ flora), is the\r\nrecord. The region between Spain and Ireland, and the rest of this\r\nmeiocene continent, was destroyed by some geological movement, but\r\nthere were left traces of the connexion which still remain.\r\nEastwards of the flora just mentioned, there is a flora common to\r\nDevon and Cornwall, to the south-east part of Ireland, the Channel\r\nIsles, and the adjacent provinces of France;--a flora passing to a\r\nsouthern character; and having its course marked by the remains of a\r\ngreat rocky barrier, the destruction of which probably took place\r\nanterior to the formation of the narrower part of the channel.\r\nEastward from this _Devon_ or _Norman_ flora, again, we have the\r\n_Kentish_ flora, which is an extension of the flora of North-western\r\nFrance, insulated by the breach which formed the straits of Dover.\r\nThen came the _Glacial period_, when the east of England and the\r\nnorth of Europe were submerged, the northern drift was distributed,\r\nand England was reduced to a chain of islands or ridges, formed by\r\nthe mountains of Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland, which were\r\nconnected with the land of Scandinavia. This was the period of\r\nglaciers, of the dispersion of boulders, of the grooving and\r\nscratching of rocks as they are now found. The climate being then\r\nmuch colder than it now is, the flora, even down to the water's\r\nedge, consisted of what are now Alpine plants; and this _Alpine_\r\nflora is common to Scandinavia and to our mountain-summits. And\r\nthese plants kept their places, when, by the elevation of the land,\r\nthe whole of the present German Ocean became a continent connecting\r\nBritain with central Europe. For the increased elevation of their\r\nstations counterbalanced the diminished cold of the succeeding\r\nperiod. Along the dry bed of the German Sea, thus elevated, the\r\nprincipal part of the existing flora of England, the _Germanic_\r\nflora, migrated. A large portion of our existing animal population\r\nalso came over through the same region; and along with those, came\r\nhyenas, tigers, rhinoceros, aurochs, elk, wolves, beavers, which are\r\nextinct in Britain, and other animals which are extinct altogether,\r\nas the primigenian elephant or mammoth. But then, again, the German\r\nOcean and the Irish Channel were scooped out; and the climate again\r\nchanged. In our islands, so detached, many of the larger beasts\r\nperished, and their bones were covered up in peat-mosses and caves,\r\nwhere we find them. This distinguished naturalist has further shown\r\nthat the population of the sea lends itself to the same view. Mr.\r\nForbes says that the writings of Mr. Smith, of Jordan-hill, \"On the\r\nlast Changes in the relative Levels of the Land and Sea in the\r\nBritish Islands,\" published in the _Memoirs of the_ {576} _Wernerian\r\nSociety for_ 1837-8, must be esteemed the foundation of a critical\r\ninvestigation of this subject in Britain.]\r\n\r\n2. _Extinction of Species._--With regard to the extinction of\r\nspecies Mr. Lyell has propounded a doctrine which is deserving of\r\ngreat attention here. Brocchi, when he had satisfied himself, by\r\nexamination of the Sub-Apennines, that about half the species which\r\nhad lived at the period of their deposition, had since become\r\nextinct, suggested as a possible cause for this occurrence, that the\r\nvital energies of a species, like that of an individual, might\r\ngradually decay in the progress of time and of generations, till at\r\nlast the prolific power might fail, and the species wither away.\r\nSuch a property would be conceivable as a physiological fact; for we\r\nsee something of the kind in fruit-trees propagated by cuttings:\r\nafter some time, the stock appears to wear out, and loses its\r\npeculiar qualities. But we have no sufficient evidence that this is\r\nthe case in generations of creatures continued by the reproductive\r\npowers. Mr. Lyell conceives, that, without admitting any inherent\r\nconstitutional tendency to deteriorate, the misfortunes to which\r\nplants and animals are exposed by the change of the physical\r\ncircumstances of the earth, by the alteration of land and water, and\r\nby the changes of climate, must very frequently occasion the loss of\r\nseveral species. We have historical evidence of the extinction of\r\none conspicuous species, the Dodo, a bird of large size and singular\r\nform, which inhabited the Isle of France when that island was first\r\ndiscovered, and which now no longer exists. Several other species of\r\nanimals and plants seem to be in the course of vanishing from the\r\nface of the earth, even under our own observation. And taking into\r\naccount the greater changes of the surface of the globe which\r\ngeology compels us to assume, we may imagine many or all the\r\nexisting species of living things to be extirpated. If, for\r\ninstance, that reduction of the climate of the earth which appears,\r\nfrom geological evidence, to have taken place already, be supposed\r\nto go on much further, the advancing snow and cold of the polar\r\nregions may destroy the greater part of our plants and animals, and\r\ndrive the remainder, or those of them which possess the requisite\r\nfaculties of migration and accommodation, to seek an asylum near the\r\nequator. And if we suppose the temperature of the earth to be still\r\nfurther reduced, this zone of now-existing life, having no further\r\nplace of refuge, will perish, and the whole earth will be tenanted,\r\nif at all, by a new creation. Other causes might produce the same\r\neffect as a change of climate; and, without supposing such causes to\r\naffect the whole globe, it is easy to {577} imagine circumstances\r\nsuch as might entirely disturb the equilibrium which the powers of\r\ndiffusion of different species have produced;--might give to some\r\nthe opportunity of invading and conquering the domain of others; and\r\nin the end, the means of entirely suppressing them, and establishing\r\nthemselves in their place.\r\n\r\nThat this extirpation of certain species, which, as we have seen,\r\nhappens in a few cases under common circumstances, might happen upon\r\na greater scale, if the range of external changes were to be much\r\nenlarged, cannot be doubted. The extent, therefore, to which natural\r\ncauses may account for the extinction of species, will depend upon\r\nthe amount of change which we suppose in the physical conditions of\r\nthe earth. It must be a task of extreme difficulty to estimate the\r\neffect upon the organic world, even if the physical circumstances\r\nwere given. To determine the physical condition to which a given\r\nstate of the earth would give rise, I have already noted as another\r\nvery difficult problem. Yet these two problems must be solved, in\r\norder to enable us to judge of the sufficiency of any hypothesis of\r\nthe extinction of species; and in the mean time, for the mode in\r\nwhich new species come into the places of those which are\r\nextinguished, we have (as we have seen) no hypothesis which\r\nphysiology can, for a moment, sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 7.--_The Imbedding of Organic Remains._\r\n\r\nTHERE is still one portion of the Dynamics of Geology, a branch of\r\ngreat and manifest importance, which I have to notice, but upon\r\nwhich I need only speak very briefly. The mode in which the spoils\r\nof existing plants and animals are imbedded in the deposits now\r\nforming, is a subject which has naturally attracted the attention of\r\ngeologists. During the controversy which took place in Italy\r\nrespecting the fossils of the Sub-Apennine hills, Vitaliano\r\nDonati,[92\\18] in 1750, undertook an examination of the Adriatic,\r\nand found that deposits containing shells and corals, extremely\r\nresembling the strata of the hills, were there in the act of\r\nformation. But without dwelling on other observations of like kind,\r\nI may state that Mr. Lyell has treated this subject, and all the\r\ntopics connected with it, in a very full and satisfactory manner. He\r\nhas explained,[93\\18] by an excellent collection of illustrative\r\nfacts, how deposits of various substance and contents are formed;\r\nhow plants and animals become fossil in peat, in blown sand, in\r\nvolcanic matter, in {578} alluvial soil, in caves, and in the beds\r\nof lakes and seas. This exposition is of the most instructive\r\ncharacter, as a means of obtaining right conclusions concerning the\r\ncauses of geological phenomena. Indeed, in many cases, the\r\nsimilarity of past effects with operations now going on, is so\r\ncomplete, that they may be considered as identical; and the\r\ndiscussion of such cases belongs, at the same time, to Geological\r\nDynamics and to Physical Geology; just as the problem of the fall of\r\nmeteorolites may be considered as belonging alike to mechanics and\r\nto physical astronomy. The growth of modern peat-mosses, for\r\nexample, fully explains the formation of the most ancient: objects\r\nare buried in the same manner in the ejections of active and of\r\nextinct volcanoes; within the limits of history, many estuaries have\r\nbeen filled up; and in the deposits which have occupied these\r\nplaces, are strata containing shells,[94\\18] as in the older\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n[Note 92\\18: Lyell, B.

In former times, Geology was always associated\r\nwith Mineralogy, and sometimes confounded with it; but the mistake\r\nof such an arrangement must be clear, from what has been said.\r\nGeology is connected with Mineralogy, only so far as the latter\r\nscience classifies a large portion of the objects which Geology\r\nemploys as evidence of its statements. To confound the two is the\r\nsame error as it would be to treat philosophical history as\r\nidentical with the knowledge of medals. Geology procures evidence of\r\nher conclusions wherever she can; from minerals or from seas; from\r\ninorganic or from organic bodies; from the ground or from the skies.\r\nThe geologist's business is to learn the past history of the earth;\r\nand he is no more limited to one or a few kinds of documents, as his\r\nsources of information, than is the historian of man, in the\r\nexecution of a similar task.\r\n\r\nPhysical Geology, of which I now speak, may not be always easily\r\nseparable from Descriptive Geology: in fact, they have generally\r\nbeen combined, for few have been content to describe, without\r\nattempting in some measure to explain. Indeed, if they had done so,\r\nit is {580} probable that their labors would have been far less\r\nzealous, and their expositions far less impressive. We by no means\r\nregret, therefore, the mixture of these two kinds of knowledge,\r\nwhich has so often occurred; but still, it is our business to\r\nseparate them. The works of astronomers before the rise of sound\r\nphysical astronomy, were full of theories, but these were\r\nadvantageous, not prejudicial, to the progress of the science.\r\n\r\nGeological theories have been abundant and various; but yet our\r\nhistory of them must be brief. For our object is, as must be borne in\r\nmind, to exhibit these, only so far as they are steps discoverably\r\ntending to the _true_ theory of the earth: and in most of them we do\r\nnot trace this character. Or rather, the portions of the labors of\r\ngeologists which do merit this praise, belong to the two preceding\r\ndivisions of the subject, and have been treated of there.\r\n\r\nThe history of Physical Geology, considered as the advance towards a\r\nscience as real and stable as those which we have already treated of\r\n(and this is the form in which we ought to trace it), hitherto\r\nconsists of few steps. We hardly know whether the progress is begun.\r\nThe history of Physical Astronomy almost commences with Newton, and\r\nfew persons will venture to assert that the Newton of Geology has\r\nyet appeared.\r\n\r\nStill, some examination of the attempts which have been made is\r\nrequisite, in order to explain and justify the view which the\r\nanalogy of scientific history leads us to take, of the state of the\r\nsubject. Though far from intending to give even a sketch of all past\r\ngeological speculations, I must notice some of the forms such\r\nspeculations have at different times assumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Of Fanciful Geological Opinions._\r\n\r\nREAL and permanent geological knowledge, like all other physical\r\nknowledge, can be obtained only by inductions of classification and\r\nlaw from many clearly seen phenomena. The labor of the most active,\r\nthe talent of the most intelligent, are requisite for such a\r\npurpose. But far less than this is sufficient to put in busy\r\noperation the inventive and capricious fancy. A few appearances\r\nhastily seen, and arbitrarily interpreted, are enough to give rise\r\nto a wondrous tale of the past, full of strange events and\r\nsupernatural agencies. The mythology and early poetry of nations\r\nafford sufficient evidence of man's love of the wonderful, and of\r\nhis inventive powers, in early stages of intellectual development.\r\nThe scientific faculty, on the other hand, {581} and especially that\r\npart of it which is requisite for the induction of laws from facts,\r\nemerges slowly and with difficulty from the crowd of adverse\r\ninfluences, even under the most favorable circumstances. We have\r\nseen that in the ancient world, the Greeks alone showed themselves\r\nto possess this talent; and what they thus attained to, amounted\r\nonly to a few sound doctrines in astronomy, and one or two extremely\r\nimperfect truths in mechanics, optics, and music, which their\r\nsuccessors were unable to retain. No other nation, till we come to\r\nthe dawn of a better day in modern Europe, made any positive step at\r\nall in sound physical speculation. Empty dreams or useless\r\nexhibitions of ingenuity, formed the whole of their essays at such\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt must, therefore, independently of positive evidence, be\r\nconsidered as extremely improbable, that any of these nations\r\nshould, at an early period, have arrived, by observation and\r\ninduction, at wide general truths, such as the philosophers of\r\nmodern times have only satisfied themselves of by long and patient\r\nlabor and thought. If resemblances should be discovered between the\r\nassertions of ancient writers and the discoveries of modern science,\r\nthe probability in all cases, the certainty in most, is that these\r\nare accidental coincidences;--that the ancient opinion is no\r\nanticipation of the modern discovery, but is one guess among many,\r\nnot a whit the more valuable because its expression agrees with a\r\ntruth. The author of the guess could not intend the truth, because\r\nhis mind was not prepared to comprehend it. Those of the ancients\r\nwho spoke of the _harmony_ which binds all things together, could\r\nnot mean the Newtonian gravitation, because they had never been led\r\nto conceive an attractive force, governed by definite mathematical\r\nlaws in its quantity and operation.\r\n\r\nIn agreement with these views, we must, I conceive, estimate the\r\nopinions which we find among the ancients, respecting the changes\r\nwhich the earth's surface has undergone. These opinions, when they\r\nare at all of a general kind, are arbitrary fictions of the fancy,\r\nshowing man's love of generality indeed, but indulging it without\r\nthat expense of labor and thought which alone can render it\r\nlegitimate.\r\n\r\nWe might, therefore, pass by all the traditions and speculations of\r\nOriental, Egyptian, and Greek cosmogony, as extraneous to our\r\nsubject. But since these have recently been spoken of, as\r\nconclusions collected, however vaguely, from observed facts,[95\\18]\r\nwe may make a remark or two upon them. {582}\r\n\r\n[Note 95\\18: Lyell, B. i. c. ii. p. 8. (4th ed.)]\r\n\r\nThe notion of a series of creations and destructions of worlds,\r\nwhich appears in the sacred volume of the Hindoos, which formed part\r\nof the traditionary lore of Egypt, and which was afterwards adopted\r\ninto the poetry and philosophy of Greece, must be considered as a\r\nmythological, not a physical, doctrine. When this doctrine was dwelt\r\nupon, men's thoughts were directed, not to the terrestrial facts\r\nwhich it seemed to explain, but to the attributes of the deities\r\nwhich it illustrated. The conception of a Supreme power, impelling\r\nand guiding the progress of events, which is permanent among all\r\nperpetual change, and regular among all seeming chance, was readily\r\nentertained by contemplative and enthusiastic minds; and when\r\nnatural phenomena were referred to this doctrine, it was rather for\r\nthe purpose of fastening its impressiveness upon the senses, than in\r\nthe way of giving to it authority and support. Hence we perceive\r\nthat in the exposition of this doctrine, an attempt was always made\r\nto fill and elevate the mind with the notions of marvellous events,\r\nand of infinite times, in which vast cycles of order recurred. The\r\n\"great year,\" in which all celestial phenomena come round, offered\r\nitself as capable of being calculated; and a similar great year was\r\nreadily assumed for terrestrial and human events. Hence there were\r\nto be brought round by great cycles, not only deluges and\r\nconflagrations which were to destroy and renovate the earth, but\r\nalso the series of historical occurrences. Not only the sea and land\r\nwere to recommence their alternations, but there was to be another\r\nArgo, which should carry warriors on the first sea-foray,[96\\18] and\r\nanother succession of heroic wars. Looking at the passages of\r\nancient authors which refer to terrestrial changes in this view, we\r\nshall see that they are addressed almost entirely to the love of the\r\nmarvellous and the infinite, and cannot with propriety be taken as\r\nindications of a spirit of physical philosophy. For example, if we\r\nturn to the celebrated passage in Ovid,[97\\18] where Pythagoras is\r\nrepresented as asserting that land becomes sea, and sea land, and\r\nmany other changes which geologists have verified, we find that\r\nthese observations are associated with many fables, as being matter\r\nof exactly the same kind;--the fountain of Ammon which was cold by\r\nday and warm by night;[98\\18]--the waters of Salmacis which\r\neffeminate men;--the Clitorian spring which makes them loathe\r\nwine;--the Simplegades islands which were once moveable;--the\r\nTritonian lake which covered men's bodies with feathers;--and many\r\nsimilar marvels. And the general purport of {583} the whole is, to\r\ncountenance the doctrine of the metempsychosis, and the Pythagorean\r\ninjunction of not eating animal food. It is clear, I think, that\r\nfacts so introduced must be considered as having been contemplated\r\nrather in the spirit of poetry than of science.\r\n\r\n[Note 96\\18: Virg. _Eclog._ 4.]\r\n\r\n[Note 97\\18: _Met._ Lib. xv.]\r\n\r\n[Note 98\\18: V. 309, &c.]\r\n\r\nWe must estimate in the same manner, the very remarkable passage\r\nbrought to light by M. Elie de Beaumont,[99\\18] from the Arabian\r\nwriter, Kazwiri; in which we have a representation of the same spot\r\nof ground, as being, at successive intervals of five hundred years,\r\na city, a sea, a desert, and again a city. This invention is\r\nadduced, I conceive, rather to feed the appetite of wonder, than to\r\nfix it upon any reality: as the title of his book, _The Marvels of\r\nNature_ obviously intimates.\r\n\r\n[Note 99\\18: _Ann. des Sc. Nat._ xxv. 380.]\r\n\r\nThe speculations of Aristotle, concerning the exchanges of land and\r\nsea which take place in long periods, are not formed in exactly the\r\nsame spirit, but they are hardly more substantial; and seem to be\r\nquite as arbitrary, since they are not confirmed by any examples and\r\nproofs. After stating,[100\\18] that the same spots of the earth are\r\nnot always land and always water, he gives the reason. \"The\r\nprinciple and cause of this is,\" he says, \"that the inner parts of\r\nthe earth, like the bodies of plants and animals, have their ages of\r\nvigor and of decline; but in plants and animals all the parts are in\r\nvigor, and all grow old, at once: in the earth different parts\r\narrive at maturity at different times by the operation of cold and\r\nheat: they grow and decay on account of the sun and the revolution\r\nof the stars, and thus the parts of the earth acquire different\r\npower, so that for a certain time they remain moist, and then become\r\ndry and old: and then other places are revivified, and become\r\npartially watery.\" We are, I conceive, doing no injustice to such\r\nspeculations by classing them among _fanciful_ geological opinions.\r\n\r\n[Note 100\\18: _Meteorol._ i. 14.]\r\n\r\nWe must also, I conceive, range in the same division another class\r\nof writers of much more modern times;--I mean those who have trained\r\ntheir geology by interpretations of Scripture. I have already\r\nendeavored to show that such an attempt is a perversion of the\r\npurpose of a divine communication, and cannot lead to any physical\r\ntruth. I do not here speak of geological speculations in which the\r\nMosaic account of the deluge has been referred to; for whatever\r\nerrors may have been committed on that subject, it would be as\r\nabsurd to disregard the most ancient historical record, in\r\nattempting to trace back the history of the earth, as it would be,\r\ngratuitously to reject any other {584} source of information. But\r\nthe interpretations of the account of the creation have gone further\r\nbeyond the limits of sound philosophy: and when we look at the\r\narbitrary and fantastical inventions by which a few phrases of the\r\nwritings of Moses have been moulded into complete systems, we cannot\r\ndoubt that these interpretations belong to the present Section.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to criticize, nor even to enumerate, these\r\nScriptural Geologies,--_Sacred Theories of the Earth_, as Burnet\r\ntermed his. Ray, Woodward, Whiston, and many other persons to whom\r\nscience has considerable obligations, were involved, by the\r\nspeculative habits of their times, in these essays; and they have\r\nbeen resumed by persons of considerable talent and some knowledge,\r\non various occasions up to the present day; but the more geology has\r\nbeen studied on its own proper evidence, the more have geologists\r\nseen the unprofitable character of such labors.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the next step in the progress of Theoretical\r\nGeology.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 3.--_Of Premature Geological Theories._\r\n\r\nWHILE we were giving our account of Descriptive Geology, the\r\nattentive reader would perceive that we did, in fact, state several\r\nsteps in the advance towards general knowledge; but when, in those\r\ncases, the theoretical aspect of such discoveries softened into an\r\nappearance of mere classification, the occurrence was assigned to\r\nthe history of Descriptive rather than of Theoretical Geology. Of\r\nsuch a kind was the establishment, by a long and vehement\r\ncontroversy, of the fact, that the impressions in rocks are really\r\nthe traces of ancient living things; such, again, were the division\r\nof rocks into Primitive, Secondary, Tertiary; the ascertainment of\r\nthe orderly succession of organic remains: the consequent fixation\r\nof a standard series of formations and strata; the establishment of\r\nthe igneous nature of trap rocks; and the like. These are geological\r\ntruths which are assumed and implied in the very language which\r\ngeology uses; thus showing how in this, as in all other sciences,\r\nthe succeeding steps involve the preceding. But in the history of\r\ngeological theory, we have to consider the wider attempts to combine\r\nthe facts, and to assign them to their causes.\r\n\r\nThe close of the last century produced two antagonist theories of\r\nthis kind, which long maintained a fierce and doubtful\r\nstruggle;--that of Werner and that of Hutton: the one termed\r\n_Neptunian_, from its {585} ascribing the phenomena of the earth's\r\nsurface mainly to aqueous agency; the other _Plutonian_ or\r\n_Vulcanian_, because it employed the force of subterraneous fire as\r\nits principal machinery. The circumstance which is most worthy of\r\nnotice in these remarkable essays is, the endeavor to give, by means\r\nof such materials as the authors possessed, a complete and simple\r\naccount of all the facts of the earth's history. The Saxon\r\nprofessor, proceeding on the examination of a small district in\r\nGermany, maintained the existence of a chaotic fluid, from which a\r\nseries of universal formations had been precipitated, the position\r\nof the strata being broken up by the falling in of subterraneous\r\ncavities, in the intervals between these depositions. The Scotch\r\nphilosopher, who had observed in England and Scotland, thought\r\nhimself justified in declaring that the existing causes were\r\nsufficient to spread new strata on the bottom of the ocean, and that\r\nthey are consolidated, elevated, and fractured by volcanic heat, so\r\nas to give rise to new continents.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be now denied that all that is to remain as permanent\r\nscience in each of these systems must be proved by the examination\r\nof many cases and limited by many conditions and circumstances.\r\nTheories so wide and simple, were consistent only with a\r\ncomparatively scanty collection of facts, and belong to the early\r\nstage of geological knowledge. In the progress of the science, the\r\n\"theory\" of each part of the earth must come out of the examination\r\nof that part, combined with all that is well established, concerning\r\nall the rest; and a general theory must result from the comparison\r\nof all such partial theoretical views. Any attempt to snatch it\r\nbefore its time must fail; and therefore we may venture at present\r\nto designate general theories, like those of Hutton and Werner, as\r\n_premature_.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is the sentiment of most of the good geologists of the\r\npresent day. The time for such general systems, and for the fierce\r\nwars to which the opposition of such generalities gives rise, is\r\nprobably now past for ever; and geology will not again witness such\r\na controversy as that of the Wernerian and Huttonian schools.\r\n  . . . . . . As when two black clouds\r\n  With heaven's artillery fraught, come rattling on\r\n  Over the Caspian: then stand front to front,\r\n  Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow\r\n  To join their dark encounter in mid-air.\r\n  So frowned the mighty combatants, that hell\r\n  Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood:\r\n  For never but once more was either like\r\n  To meet so great a foe. {586}\r\n\r\nThe main points really affecting the progress of sound theoretical\r\ngeology, will find a place in one of the two next Sections.\r\n\r\n[2nd Ed.] [I think I do no injustice to Dr. Hutton in describing his\r\ntheory of the earth as _premature_. Prof. Playfair's elegant work,\r\n_Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory_ (1802,) so justly admired,\r\ncontains many doctrines which the more mature geology of modern\r\ntimes rejects; such as the igneous origin of chalk-flints, siliceous\r\npudding stone, and the like; the universal formation of river-beds\r\nby the rivers themselves; and other points. With regard to this\r\nlast-mentioned question, I think all who have read Deluc's\r\n_Geologie_ (1810) will deem his refutation of Playfair complete.\r\n\r\nBut though Hutton's theory was premature, as well as Werner's, the\r\nformer had a far greater value as an important step on the road to\r\ntruth. Many of its boldest hypotheses and generalizations have\r\nbecome a part of the general creed of geologists; and its\r\npublication is perhaps the greatest event which has yet occurred in\r\nthe progress of Physical Geology.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO ANTAGONIST DOCTRINES OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 1.--_Of the Doctrine of Geological Catastrophes._\r\n\r\nTHAT great changes, of a kind and intensity quite different from the\r\ncommon course of events, and which may therefore properly be called\r\n_catastrophes_, have taken place upon the earth's surface, was an\r\nopinion which appeared to be forced upon men by obvious facts.\r\nRejecting, as a mere play of fancy, the notions of the destruction\r\nof the earth by cataclysms or conflagrations, of which we have\r\nalready spoken, we find that the first really scientific examination\r\nof the materials of the earth, that of the Sub-Apennine hills, led\r\nmen to draw this inference. Leonardo da Vinci, whom we have already\r\nnoticed for his early and strenuous assertion of the real marine\r\norigin of fossil impressions of shells, also maintained that the\r\nbottom of the sea had become the top of the mountain; yet his mode\r\nof explaining this may perhaps be claimed by the modern advocates of\r\nuniform causes as more allied to their {587} opinion, than to the\r\ndoctrine of catastrophes.[101\\18] But Steno, in 1669, approached\r\nnearer to this doctrine; for he asserted that Tuscany must have\r\nchanged its face at intervals, so as to acquire six different\r\nconfigurations, by the successive breaking down of the older strata\r\ninto inclined positions, and the horizontal deposit of new ones upon\r\nthem. Strabo, indeed, at an earlier period had recourse to\r\nearthquakes, to explain the occurrence of shells in mountains; and\r\nHooke published the same opinion later. But the Italian geologists\r\nprosecuted their researches under the advantage of having, close at\r\nhand, large collections of conspicuous and consistent phenomena.\r\nLazzaro Moro, in 1740, attempted to apply the theory of earthquakes\r\nto the Italian strata; but both he and his expositor, Cirillo\r\nGenerelli, inclined rather to reduce the violence of these\r\noperations within the ordinary course of nature,[102\\18] and thus\r\nleant to the doctrine of uniformity, of which we have afterwards to\r\nspeak. Moro was encouraged in this line of speculation by the\r\nextraordinary occurrence, as it was deemed by most persons, of the\r\nrise of a new volcanic island from a deep part of the Mediterranean,\r\nnear Santorino, in 1707.[103\\18] But in other countries, as the\r\ngeological facts were studied, the doctrine of catastrophes appeared\r\nto gain ground. Thus in England, where, through a large part of the\r\ncountry, the coal-measures are extremely inclined and contorted, and\r\ncovered over by more horizontal fragmentary beds, the opinion that\r\nsome violent catastrophe had occurred to dislocate them, before the\r\nsuperincumbent strata were deposited, was strongly held. It was\r\nconceived that a period of violent and destructive action must have\r\nsucceeded to one of repose; and that, for a time, some unusual and\r\nparoxysmal forces must have been employed in elevating and breaking\r\nthe pre-existing strata, and wearing their fragments into smooth\r\npebbles, before nature subsided into a new age of tranquillity and\r\nvitality. In like manner Cuvier, from the alternations of\r\nfresh-water and salt-water species in the strata of Paris, collected\r\nthe opinion of a series of great revolutions, in which \"the thread\r\nof induction was broken.\" Deluc and others, to whom we owe the first\r\nsteps in geological dynamics, attempted carefully to distinguish\r\nbetween causes now in action, and those which have ceased to act; in\r\nwhich latter class they reckoned the causes which have {588}\r\nelevated the existing continents. This distinction was assented to\r\nby many succeeding geologists. The forces which have raised into the\r\nclouds the vast chains of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Andes, must\r\nhave been, it was deemed, something very different from any agencies\r\nnow operating.\r\n\r\n[Note 101\\18: \"Here is a part of the earth which has become more\r\nlight, and which rises, while the opposite part approaches nearer to\r\nthe centre, and what was the bottom of the sea is become the top of\r\nthe mountain.\"--Venturi's _Léonardo da Vinci_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 102\\18: Lyell, i. 3. p. 64. (4th ed.)]\r\n\r\n[Note 103\\18: Ib. p. 60.]\r\n\r\nThis opinion was further confirmed by the appearance of a complete\r\nchange in the forms of animal and vegetable life, in passing from\r\none formation to another. The species of which the remains occurred,\r\nwere entirely different, it was said, in two successive epochs: a\r\nnew creation appears to have intervened; and it was readily believed\r\nthat a transition, so entirely out of the common course of the\r\nworld, might be accompanied by paroxysms of mechanical energy. Such\r\nviews prevail extensively among geologists up to the present time:\r\nfor instance, in the comprehensive theoretical generalizations of\r\nElie de Beaumont and others, respecting mountain-chains, it is\r\nsupposed that, at certain vast intervals, systems of mountains,\r\nwhich may be recognized by the parallelism of course of their\r\ninclined beds, have been disturbed and elevated, lifting up with\r\nthem the aqueous strata which had been deposited among them in the\r\nintervening periods of tranquillity, and which are recognized and\r\nidentified by means of their organic remains: and according to the\r\nadherents of this hypothesis, these sudden elevations of\r\nmountain-chains have been followed, again and again, by mighty\r\nwaves, desolating whole regions of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar bearing of such opinions upon the progress of physical\r\ngeology will be better understood by attending to the _doctrine of\r\nuniformity_, which is opposed to them, and with the consideration of\r\nwhich we shall close our survey of this science, the last branch of\r\nour present task.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 2.--_Of the Doctrine of Geological Uniformity._\r\n\r\nTHE opinion that the history of the earth had involved a serious of\r\ncatastrophes, confirmed by the two great classes of facts, the\r\nsymptoms of mechanical violence on a very large scale, and of\r\ncomplete changes in the living things by which the earth had been\r\ntenanted, took strong hold of the geologists of England, France, and\r\nGermany. Hutton, though he denied that there was evidence of a\r\nbeginning of the present state of things, and referred many\r\nprocesses in the formation of strata to existing causes, did not\r\nassert that the elevatory forces which raise continents from the\r\nbottom of the ocean, were of the same order, {589} as well as of the\r\nsame kind, with the volcanoes and earthquakes which now shake the\r\nsurface. His doctrine of uniformity was founded rather on the\r\nsupposed analogy of other lines of speculation, than on the\r\nexamination of the amount of changes now going on. \"The Author of\r\nnature,\" it was said, \"has not permitted in His works any symptom of\r\ninfancy or of old age, or any sign by which we may estimate either\r\ntheir future or their past duration:\" and the example of the\r\nplanetary system was referred to in illustration of this.[104\\18]\r\nAnd a general persuasion that the champions of this theory were not\r\ndisposed to accept the usual opinions on the subject of creation,\r\nwas allowed, perhaps very unjustly, to weigh strongly against them\r\nin the public opinion.\r\n\r\n[Note 104\\18: Lyell, i. 4, p. 94.]\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of Europe had a decided bias towards the doctrine of\r\ngeological catastrophes, the phenomena of Italy, which, as we have\r\nseen, had already tended to soften the rigor of that doctrine, in the\r\nprogress of speculation from Steno to Generelli, were destined to\r\nmitigate it still more, by converting to the belief of uniformity\r\ntransalpine geologists who had been bred up in the catastrophist\r\ncreed. This effect was, indeed, gradual. For a time the distinction of\r\nthe _recent_ and the _tertiary_ period was held to be marked and\r\nstrong. Brocchi asserted that a large portion of the Sub-Apennine\r\nfossil shells belonged to a living species of the Mediterranean Sea:\r\nbut the geologists of the rest of Europe turned an incredulous ear to\r\nthis Italian tenet; and the persuasion of the distinction of the\r\ntertiary and the recent period was deeply impressed on most geologists\r\nby the memorable labors of Cuvier and Brongniart on the Paris basin.\r\nStill, as other tertiary deposits were examined, it was found that\r\nthey could by no means be considered as contemporaneous, but that they\r\nformed a chain of posts, advancing nearer and nearer to the recent\r\nperiod. Above the strata of the basins of London and Paris,[105\\18]\r\nlie the newer strata of Touraine, of Bourdeaux, of the valley of the\r\nBormida and the Superga near Turin, and of the basin of Vienna,\r\nexplored by M. Constant Prevost. Newer and higher still than these,\r\nare found the Sub-Apennine formations of Northern Italy, and probably\r\nof the same period, the English \"crag\" of Norfolk and Suffolk. And\r\nmost of these marine formations are associated with volcanic products\r\nand fresh-water deposits, so as to imply apparently a long train of\r\nalternations of corresponding processes. It may easily be supposed\r\nthat, when the subject had assumed this form, the boundary of the\r\npresent and past condition of the earth {590} was in some measure\r\nobscured. But it was not long before a very able attempt was made to\r\nobliterate it altogether. In 1828, Mr. Lyell set out on a geological\r\ntour through France and Italy.[106\\18] He had already conceived the\r\nidea of classing the tertiary groups by reference to the number of\r\nrecent species which were found in a fossil state. But as he passed\r\nfrom the north to the south of Italy, he found, by communication with\r\nthe best fossil conchologists, Borelli at Turin, Guidotti at Parma,\r\nCosta at Naples, that the number of extinct species decreased; so that\r\nthe last-mentioned naturalist, from an examination of the fossil\r\nshells of Otranto and Calabria, and of the neighboring seas, was of\r\nopinion that few of the tertiary shells were of extinct species. To\r\ncomplete the series of proof, Mr. Lyell himself explored the strata of\r\nIschia, and found, 2000 feet above the level of the sea, shells, which\r\nwere all pronounced to be of species now inhabiting the Mediterranean;\r\nand soon after, he made collections of a similar description on the\r\nflanks of Etna, in the Val di Noto, and in other places.\r\n\r\n[Note 105\\18: Lyell, 1st ed. vol. iii. p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Note 106\\18: 1st ed. vol. iii. Pref.]\r\n\r\nThe impression produced by these researches is described by\r\nhimself.[107\\18] \"In the course of my tour I had been frequently led\r\nto reflect on the precept of Descartes, that a philosopher should\r\nonce in his life doubt everything he had been taught; but I still\r\nretained so much faith in my early geological creed as to feel the\r\nmost lively surprize on visiting Sortino, Pentalica, Syracuse, and\r\nother parts of the Val di Noto, at beholding a limestone of enormous\r\nthickness, filled with recent shells, or sometimes with mere casts\r\nof shells, resting on marl in which shells of Mediterranean species\r\nwere imbedded in a high state of preservation. All idea of\r\n[necessarily] attaching a high antiquity to a regularly-stratified\r\nlimestone, in which the casts and impressions of shells alone were\r\nvisible, vanished at once from my mind. At the same time, I was\r\nstruck with the identity of the associated igneous rocks of the Val\r\ndi Noto with well-known varieties of 'trap' in Scotland and other\r\nparts of Europe; varieties which I had also seen entering largely\r\ninto the structure of Etna.\r\n\r\n[Note 107\\18: Lyell, 1st ed. Pref. x.]\r\n\r\n\"I occasionally amused myself,\" Mr. Lyell adds, \"with speculating on\r\nthe different rate of progress which geology might have made, had it\r\nbeen first cultivated with success at Catania, where the phenomena\r\nabove alluded to, and the great elevation of the modern tertiary beds\r\nin the Val di Noto, and the changes produced in the historical era by\r\nthe Calabrian earthquakes, would have been familiarly known.\" {591}\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Lyell entered upon his journey, he had put into the hands\r\nof the printer the first volume of his \"Principles of Geology, being\r\nan attempt to explain the former Changes of the Earth's Surface _by\r\nreference to the Causes now in Operation_.\" And after viewing such\r\nphenomena as we have spoken of, he, no doubt, judged that the\r\ndoctrine of catastrophes of a kind entirely different from the\r\nexisting course of events, would never have been generally received,\r\nif geologists had at first formed their opinions upon the Sicilian\r\nstrata. The boundary separating the present from the anterior state\r\nof things crumbled away; the difference of fossil and recent species\r\nhad disappeared, and, at the same time, the changes of position\r\nwhich marine strata had undergone, although not inferior to those of\r\nearlier geological periods, might be ascribed, it was thought, to\r\nthe same kind of earthquakes as those which still agitate that\r\nregion. Both the supposed proofs of catastrophic transition, the\r\norganical and the mechanical changes, failed at the same time; the\r\none by the removal of the fact, the other by the exhibition of the\r\ncause. The powers of earthquakes, even such as they now exist, were,\r\nit was supposed, if allowed to operate for an illimitable time,\r\nadequate to produce all the mechanical effects which the strata of\r\nall ages display. And it was declared that all evidence of a\r\nbeginning of the present state of the earth, or of any material\r\nalteration in the energy of the forces by which it has been modified\r\nat various epochs, was entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances in the progress of geology tended the same way.\r\nThus, in cases where there had appeared in one country a sudden and\r\nviolent transition from one stratum to the next, it was found, that\r\nby tracing the formations into other countries, the chasm between\r\nthem was filled up by intermediate strata; so that the passage\r\nbecame as gradual and gentle as any other step in the series. For\r\nexample, though the conglomerates, which in some parts of England\r\noverlie the coal-measures, appear to have been produced by a\r\ncomplete discontinuity in the series of changes; yet in the\r\ncoal-fields of Yorkshire, Durham, and Cumberland, the transition is\r\nsmoothed down in such a way that the two formations pass into each\r\nother. A similar passage is observed in Central-Germany, and in\r\nThuringia is so complete, that the coal-measures have sometimes been\r\nconsidered as subordinate to the _todtliegendes_.[108\\18]\r\n\r\n[Note 108\\18: De la Beche, p. 414, _Manual_.]\r\n\r\nUpon such evidence and such arguments, the doctrine of {592}\r\ncatastrophes was rejected with some contempt and ridicule; and it\r\nwas maintained, that the operation of the causes of geological\r\nchange may properly and philosophically be held to have been uniform\r\nthrough all ages and periods. On this opinion, and the grounds on\r\nwhich it he been urged, we shall make a few concluding remarks.\r\n\r\nIt must be granted at once, to the advocates of this geological\r\nuniformity, that we are not arbitrarily to assume the existence of\r\ncatastrophes. The degree of uniformity and continuity with which\r\nterremotive forces have acted, must be collected, not from any\r\ngratuitous hypothesis, but from the facts of the case. We must\r\nsuppose the causes which have produced geological phenomena, to have\r\nbeen as similar to existing causes, and as dissimilar, as the\r\neffects teach us. We are to avoid all bias in favor of powers\r\ndeviating in kind and degree from those which act at present; a bias\r\nwhich, Mr. Lyell asserts, has extensively prevailed among\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Lyell goes further, and considers it a merit in a\r\ncourse of geological speculation that it _rejects_ any difference\r\nbetween the intensity of existing and of past causes, we conceive\r\nthat he errs no less than those whom he censures. \"An _earnest and\r\npatient endeavor to reconcile_ the former indication of\r\nchange,\"[109\\18] with _any_ restricted class of causes,--a habit\r\nwhich he enjoins,--is not, we may suggest, the temper in which\r\nscience ought to be pursued. The effects must themselves teach us\r\nthe nature and intensity of the causes which have operated; and we\r\nare in danger of error, if we seek for slow and shun violent\r\nagencies further than the facts naturally direct us, no less than if\r\nwe were parsimonious of time and prodigal of violence. _Time_,\r\ninexhaustible and ever accumulating his efficacy, can undoubtedly do\r\nmuch for the theorist in geology; but _Force_, whose limits we\r\ncannot measure, and whose nature we cannot fathom, is also a power\r\nnever to be slighted: and to call in the one to protect us from the\r\nother, is equally presumptuous, to whichever of the two our\r\nsuperstition leans. To invoke Time, with ten thousand earthquakes,\r\nto overturn and set on edge a mountain-chain, should the phenomena\r\nindicate the change to have been sudden and not successive, would be\r\nill excused by pleading the obligation of first appealing to known\r\ncauses.[110\\18] {593}\r\n\r\n[Note 109\\18: Lyell, B. iv. c. i. p. 328, 4th ed.]\r\n\r\n[Note 110\\18: [2nd Ed.] [I have, in the text, quoted the fourth\r\nedition of Mr. Lyell's _Principles_, in which he recommends \"an\r\nearnest and patient endeavor to reconcile the former indications of\r\nchange with the evidence of gradual mutation now in progress.\" In\r\nthe sixth edition, in that which is, I presume, the corresponding\r\npassage, although it is transferred from the fourth to the first\r\nBook (B. i. c. xiii. p. 325) he recommends, instead, \"an earnest and\r\npatient inquiry how far geological appearances are reconcileable\r\nwith the effect of changes now in progress.\" But while Mr. Lyell has\r\nthus softened the advocate's character in his language in this\r\npassage, the transposition which I have noticed appears to me to\r\nhave an opposite tendency. For in the former edition, the causes now\r\nin action were first described in the second and third Books, and\r\nthe great problem of Geology, stated in the first Book, was\r\nattempted to be solved in the fourth. But by incorporating this\r\nfourth Book with the first, and thus prefixing to the study of\r\nexisting causes arguments against the belief of their geological\r\ninsufficiency, there is an appearance as if the author wished his\r\nreader to be prepared by a previous pleading against the doctrine of\r\ncatastrophes, before he went to the study of existing causes. The\r\nDoctrines of Catastrophes and of Uniformity, and the other leading\r\nquestions of the Palætiological Sciences, are further discussed in\r\nthe _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, Book x.]]\r\n\r\nIn truth, we know causes only by their effects; and in order to\r\nlearn the nature of the causes which modify the earth, we must study\r\nthem through all ages of their action, and not select arbitrarily\r\nthe period in which we live as the standard for all other epochs.\r\nThe forces which have produced the Alps and Andes are known to us by\r\nexperience, no less than the forces which have raised Etna to its\r\npresent height; for we learn their amount in both cases by their\r\nresults. Why, then, do we make a merit of using the latter case as a\r\nmeasure for the former? Or how can we know the true scale of such\r\nforce, except by comprehending in our view all the facts which we\r\ncan bring together?\r\n\r\nIn reality when we speak of the _uniformity_ of nature, are we not\r\nobliged to use the term in a very large sense, in order to make the\r\ndoctrine at all tenable? It includes catastrophes and convulsions of\r\na very extensive and intense kind; what is the limit to the violence\r\nwhich we must allow to these changes? In order to enable ourselves\r\nto represent geological causes as operating with uniform energy\r\nthrough all time, we must measure our time by long cycles, in which\r\nrepose and violence alternate; how long may we extend this cycle of\r\nchange, the repetition of which we express by the word _uniformity_?\r\n\r\nAnd why must we suppose that all our experience, geological as well\r\nas historical, includes more than _one_ such cycle? Why must we\r\ninsist upon it, that man has been long enough an observer to obtain\r\nthe _average_ of forces which are changing through immeasurable\r\ntime? {594}\r\n\r\nThe analogy of other sciences has been referred to, as sanctioning\r\nthis attempt to refer the whole train of facts to known causes. To\r\nhave done this, it has been said, is the glory of Astronomy: she\r\nseeks no hidden virtues, but explains all by the force of\r\ngravitation, which we witness operating at every moment. But let us\r\nask, whether it would really have been a merit in the founders of\r\nPhysical Astronomy, to assume that the celestial revolutions\r\nresulted from any selected class of known causes? When Newton first\r\nattempted to explain the motions of the moon by the force of\r\ngravity, and failed because the measures to which he referred were\r\nerroneous, would it have been philosophical in him, to insist that\r\nthe difference which he found ought to be overlooked, since\r\notherwise we should be compelled to go to causes other than those\r\nwhich we usually witness in action? Or was there any praise due to\r\nthose who assumed the celestial forces to be the same with gravity,\r\nrather than to those who assimilated them with any other known\r\nforce, as magnetism, till the calculation of the laws and amount of\r\nthese forces, from the celestial phenomena, had clearly sanctioned\r\nsuch an identification? We are not to select a conclusion now well\r\nproved, to persuade ourselves that it would have been wise to assume\r\nit anterior to proof, and to attempt to philosophize in the method\r\nthus recommended.\r\n\r\nAgain, the analogy of Astronomy has been referred to, as confirming\r\nthe assumption of perpetual uniformity. The analysis of the heavenly\r\nmotions, it has been said, supplies no trace of a beginning, no\r\npromise of an end. But here, also, this analogy is erroneously\r\napplied. Astronomy, as the science of cyclical motions, has nothing\r\nin common with Geology. But look at Astronomy where she has an\r\nanalogy with Geology; consider our knowledge of the heavens as a\r\npalætiological science;--as the study of a past condition, from\r\nwhich the present is derived by causes acting in time. Is there then\r\nno evidence of a beginning, or of a progress? What is the import of\r\nthe Nebular Hypothesis? A luminous matter is condensing, solid\r\nbodies are forming, are arranging themselves into systems of\r\ncyclical motion; in short, we have exactly what we are told, on this\r\nanalogy, we ought not to have;--the beginning of a world. I will\r\nnot, to justify this argument, maintain the truth of the nebular\r\nhypothesis; but if geologists wish to borrow maxims of\r\nphilosophizing from astronomy, such speculations as have led to that\r\nhypothesis must be their model.\r\n\r\nOr, let them look at any of the other provinces of palætiological\r\nspeculation; at the history of states, of civilization, of\r\nlanguages. We {595} may assume some _resemblance_ or connexion\r\nbetween the principles which determined the progress of government,\r\nor of society, or of literature, in the earliest ages, and those\r\nwhich now operate; but who has speculated successfully, assuming an\r\n_identity_ of such causes? Where do we now find a language in the\r\nprocess of formation, unfolding itself in inflexions, terminations,\r\nchanges of vowels by grammatical relations, such as characterize the\r\noldest known languages? Where do we see a nation, by its natural\r\nfaculties, inventing writing, or the arts of life, as we find them\r\nin the most ancient civilized nations? We may assume hypothetically,\r\nthat man's faculties develop themselves in these ways; but we see no\r\nsuch effects produced by these faculties, in our own time, and now\r\nin progress, without the influence of foreigners.\r\n\r\nIs it not clear, in all these cases, that history does not exhibit a\r\nseries of cycles, the aggregate of which may be represented as a\r\nuniform state, without indication of origin or termination? Does it\r\nnot rather seem evident that, in reality, the whole course of the\r\nworld, from the earliest to the present times, is but one cycle, yet\r\nunfinished;--offering, indeed, no clear evidence of the mode of its\r\nbeginning; but still less entitling us to consider it as a\r\nrepetition or series of repetitions of what had gone before?\r\n\r\nThus we find, in the analogy of the sciences, no confirmation of the\r\ndoctrine of uniformity, as it has been maintained in Geology. Yet we\r\ndiscern, in this analogy, no ground for resigning our hope, that\r\nfuture researches, both in Geology and in other palætiological\r\nsciences, may throw much additional light on the question of the\r\nuniform or catastrophic progress of things, and on the earliest\r\nhistory of the earth and of man. But when we see how wide and\r\ncomplex is the range of speculation to which our analogy has\r\nreferred us, we may well be disposed to pause in our review of\r\nscience;--to survey from our present position the ground that we\r\nhave passed over;--and thus to collect, so far as we may, guidance\r\nand encouragement to enable us to advance in the track which lies\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the subject now under consideration, we may, however,\r\nobserve, that what the analogy of science really teaches us, as the\r\nmost promising means of promoting this science, is the strenuous\r\ncultivation of the two subordinate sciences, Geological Knowledge of\r\nFacts, and Geological Dynamics. These are the two provinces of\r\nknowledge--corresponding to Phenomenal Astronomy, and Mathematical\r\nMechanics--which may lead on to the epoch of the Newton of {596}\r\ngeology. We may, indeed, readily believe that we have much to do in\r\nboth these departments. While so large a portion of the globe is\r\ngeologically unexplored;--while all the general views which are to\r\nextend our classifications satisfactorily from one hemisphere to\r\nanother, from one zone to another, are still unformed; while the\r\norganic fossils of the tropics are almost unknown, and their general\r\nrelation to the existing state of things has not even been\r\nconjectured;--how can we expect to speculate rightly and securely,\r\nrespecting the history of the whole of our globe? And if Geological\r\nClassification and Description are thus imperfect, the knowledge of\r\nGeological Causes is still more so. As we have seen, the necessity\r\nand the method of constructing a science of such causes, are only\r\njust beginning to be perceived. Here, then, is the point where the\r\nlabors of geologists may be usefully applied; and not in premature\r\nattempts to decide the widest and abstrusest questions which the\r\nhuman mind can propose to itself.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated,[111\\18] that when the Geological Society of\r\nLondon was formed, their professed object was to multiply and record\r\nobservations, and patiently to await the result at some future time;\r\nand their favorite maxim was, it is added, that the time was not yet\r\ncome for a General System of Geology. This was a wise and\r\nphilosophical temper, and a due appreciation of their position. And\r\neven now, their task is not yet finished; their mission is not yet\r\naccomplished. They have still much to do, in the way of collecting\r\nFacts; and in entering upon the exact estimation of Causes, they\r\nhave only just thrown open the door of a vast Labyrinth, which it\r\nmay employ many generations to traverse, but which they must needs\r\nexplore, before they can penetrate to the Oracular Chamber of Truth.\r\n\r\n[Note 111\\18: Lyell, B. i. c. iv. p. 103.]\r\n\r\nI REJOICE, on many accounts, to find myself arriving at the\r\ntermination of the task which I have attempted. One reason why I am\r\nglad to close my history is, that in it I have been compelled,\r\nespecially in the latter part of my labors, to speak as a judge\r\nrespecting eminent philosophers whom I reverence as my Teachers in\r\nthose very sciences on which I have had to pronounce a\r\njudgment;--if, indeed, even the appellation of Pupil be not too\r\npresumptuous. But I doubt not that such men are as full of candor\r\nand tolerance, as they are of knowledge and thought. And if they\r\ndeem, as I did, that such a history of {597} science ought to be\r\nattempted, they will know that it was not only the historian's\r\nprivilege, but his duty, to estimate the import and amount of the\r\nadvances which he had to narrate; and if they judge, as I trust they\r\nwill, that the attempt has been made with full integrity of\r\nintention and no want of labor, they will look upon the inevitable\r\nimperfections of the execution of my work with indulgence and hope.\r\n\r\nThere is another source of satisfaction in arriving at this point of\r\nmy labors. If, after our long wandering through the region of\r\nphysical science, we were left with minds unsatisfied and unraised,\r\nto ask, \"Whether this be all?\"--our employment might well be deemed\r\nweary and idle. If it appeared that all the vast labor and intense\r\nthought which has passed under our review had produced nothing but a\r\nbarren Knowledge of the external world, or a few Arts ministering\r\nmerely to our gratification; or if it seemed that the methods of\r\narriving at truth, so successfully applied in these cases, aid us\r\nnot when we come to the higher aims and prospects of our\r\nbeing;--this History might well be estimated as no less melancholy\r\nand unprofitable than those which narrate the wars of states and the\r\nwiles of statesmen. But such, I trust, is not the impression which\r\nour survey has tended to produce. At various points, the researches\r\nwhich we have followed out, have offered to lead us from matter to\r\nmind, from the external to the internal world; and it was not\r\nbecause the thread of investigation snapped in our hands, but rather\r\nbecause we were resolved to confine ourselves, for the present, to\r\nthe material sciences, that we did not proceed onwards to subjects\r\nof a closer interest. It will appear, also, I trust, that the most\r\nperfect method of obtaining speculative truth,--that of which I have\r\nhad to relate the result,--is by no means confined to the least\r\nworthy subjects; but that the Methods of learning what is really\r\ntrue, though they must assume different aspects in cases where a\r\nmere contemplation of external objects is concerned, and where our\r\nown internal world of thought, feeling, and will, supplies the\r\nmatter of our speculations, have yet a unity and harmony throughout\r\nall the possible employments of our minds. To be able to trace such\r\nconnexions as this, is the proper sequel, and would be the high\r\nreward, of the labor which has been bestowed on the present work.\r\nAnd if a persuasion of the reality of such connexions, and a\r\npreparation for studying them, have been conveyed to the reader's\r\nmind while he has been accompanying me through our long survey, his\r\ntime may not have been employed on {598} these pages in vain.\r\nHowever vague and hesitating and obscure may be such a persuasion,\r\nit belongs, I doubt not, to the dawning of a better Philosophy,\r\nwhich it may be my lot, perhaps, to develop more fully hereafter, if\r\npermitted by that Superior Power to whom all sound philosophy\r\ndirects our thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{599}}\r\nADDITIONS TO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nACOUSTICS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Velocity of Sound in Water._\r\n\r\nTHE Science of which the history is narrated in this Book has for\r\nits objects, the minute Vibrations of the parts of bodies such as\r\nthose by which Sounds are produced, and the properties of Sounds.\r\nThe Vibrations of bodies are the result of a certain tension of\r\ntheir structure which we term _Elasticity_. The Elasticity\r\ndetermines the rate of Vibration: the rate of Vibration determines\r\nthe audible note: the Elasticity determines also the velocity with\r\nwhich the vibration travels through the substance. These points of\r\nthe subject, Elasticity, Rate of Vibration, Velocity of Propagation,\r\nAudible Note, are connected in each substance, and are different in\r\ndifferent substances.\r\n\r\nIn the history of this Science, considered as tending to a\r\nsatisfactory general theory, the Problems which have obviously\r\noffered themselves were, to explain the properties of Sounds by the\r\nrelations of their constituent vibrations; and to explain the\r\nexistence of vibrations by the elasticity of the substances in which\r\nthey occurred: as in Optics, philosophers have explained the\r\nphenomenon of light and colors by the Undulatory Theory, and are\r\nstill engaged in explaining the requisite modulations by means of\r\nthe elasticity of the Ether. But the _Undulatory Theory of Sound_\r\nwas seen to be true at an early period of the Science: and the\r\nexplanation, in a general way at least, of all kinds of such\r\nundulations by means of the elasticity of the vibrating substances\r\nhas been performed by a series of mathematicians of whom I have\r\ngiven an account in this Book. Hence the points of the subject\r\nalready mentioned (Elasticity, Vibrations and their Propagations,\r\n{600} and Note), have a known material dependence, and each may be\r\nemployed in determining the other: for instance, the Note may be\r\nemployed in determining the velocity of sound and the elasticity of\r\nthe vibrating substance.\r\n\r\nChladni,[1\\B] and the Webers,[2\\B] had made valuable experimental\r\ninquiries on such subjects. But more complete investigations of this\r\nkind have been conducted with care and skill by M. Wertheim.[3\\B]\r\nFor instance, he has determined the velocity with which sound\r\ntravels in water, by making an organ-pipe to sound by the passage of\r\nwater through it. This is a matter of some difficulty; for the\r\nmouthpiece of an organ-pipe, if it be not properly and carefully\r\nconstructed, produces sounds of its own, which are not the genuine\r\nmusical note of the pipe. And though the note depends mainly upon\r\nthe length of the pipe, it depends also, in a small degree, on the\r\nbreadth of the pipe and the size of the mouthpiece.\r\n\r\n[Note 1\\B: _Traité d'Acoustique_, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2\\B: _Wellenlehre_, 1852.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3\\B: _Mémoires de Physique Mécanique_. Paris, 1848.]\r\n\r\nIf the pipe were a mere line, the time of a vibration would be the\r\ntime in which a vibration travels from one end of the pipe to the\r\nother; and thus the note for a given length (which is determined by\r\nthe time of vibration), is connected with the velocity of vibration.\r\nHe thus found that the velocity of a vibration along the pipe in\r\nsea-water is 1157 _mètres_ per second.\r\n\r\nBut M. Wertheim conceived that he had previously shown, by general\r\nmathematical reasoning, that the velocity with which sound travels\r\nin an unlimited expanse of any substance, is to the velocity with\r\nwhich it travels along a pipe or linear strip of the same substance\r\nas the square root of 3 to the square root of 2. Hence the velocity\r\nof sound in sea-water would be 1454 _mètres_ a second. The velocity\r\nof sound in air is 332 _mètres_.\r\n\r\nM. Wertheim also employed the vibrations of rods of steel and other\r\nmetals in order to determine their _modulus of elasticity_--that is,\r\nthe quantity which determines for each substance, the extent to\r\nwhich, in virtue of its elasticity, it is compressed and expanded by\r\ngiven pressures or tensions. For this purpose he caused the rod to\r\nvibrate near to a tuning-fork of given pitch, so that both the rod\r\nand the tuning-fork by their vibrations traced undulating curves on\r\na revolving disk. The curves traced by the two could be compared so\r\nas to give their relative rate, and thus to determine the elasticity\r\nof the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{601}}\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL OPTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Photography._\r\n\r\nI HAVE, at the end of Chapter xi., stated that the theory of which I\r\nhave endeavored to sketch the history professes to explain only the\r\nphenomena of radiant visible light; and that though we know that\r\nlight has other properties--for instance, that it produces chemical\r\neffects--these are not contemplated as included within the domain of\r\nthe theory. The chemical effects of light cannot as yet be included\r\nin exact and general truths, such as those which constitute the\r\nundulatory theory of radiant visible light. But though the present\r\nage has not yet attained to a _Science_ of the chemistry of Light,\r\nit has been enriched with a most exquisite _Art_, which involves the\r\nprinciples of such a science, and may hereafter be made the\r\ninstrument of bringing them into the view of the philosopher. I\r\nspeak of the Art of _Photography_, in which chemistry has discovered\r\nthe means of producing surfaces almost as sensitive to the\r\nmodifications of light as the most sensitive of organic textures,\r\nthe retina of the eye: and has given permanence to images which in\r\nthe eye are only momentary impressions. Hereafter, when the laws\r\nshall have been theoretically established, which connect the\r\nchemical constitution of bodies with the action of light upon them,\r\nthe prominent names in the Prelude to such an Epoch must be those\r\nwho by their insight, invention, and perseverance, discovered and\r\ncarried to their present marvellous perfection the processes of\r\nphotographic Art:--Niepce and Daguerre in France, and our own\r\naccomplished countryman, Mr. Fox Talbot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fluorescence._\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, it is not within the province of the undulatory\r\ntheory to explain the phenomena of the absorption of light which\r\ntake place in various ways when the light is transmitted through\r\nvarious {602} mediums. I have, at the end of Chapter iii., given the\r\nreasons which prevent my assenting to the assertion of a special\r\nanalysis of light by absorption. In the same manner, with regard to\r\nother effects produced by media upon light, it is sufficient for the\r\ndefence of the theory that it should be consistent with the\r\npossibility of the laws of phenomena which are observed, not that it\r\nshould explain those laws; for they belong, apparently, to another\r\nprovince of philosophy.\r\n\r\nSome of the optical properties of bodies which have recently\r\nattracted notice appear to be of this kind. It was noticed by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel,[4\\B] that a certain liquid, sulphate of quinine,\r\nwhich is under common circumstances colorless, exhibits in certain\r\naspects and under certain incidences of light, a beautiful celestial\r\nblue color. It appeared that this color proceeded from the surface\r\non which the light first fell; and color thus produced Sir J.\r\nHerschel called _epipolic_ colors, and spoke of the light as\r\n_epipolized_. Sir David Brewster had previously noted effects of\r\ncolor in transparent bodies which he ascribed to internal\r\ndispersion:[5\\B] and he conceived that the colors observed by Sir J.\r\nHerschel were of the same class. Professor Stokes[6\\B] of Cambridge\r\napplied himself to the examination of these phenomena, and was led\r\nto the conviction that they arise from a power which certain bodies\r\npossess, of changing the color, and with it, the refrangibility of\r\nthe rays of light which fall upon them: and he traced this property\r\nin various substances, into various remarkable consequences. As this\r\nchange of refrangibility always makes the rays _less_ refrangible,\r\nit was proposed to call it a _degradation_ of the light; or again,\r\n_dependent emission_, because the light is emitted in the manner of\r\nself-luminous bodies, but only in dependence upon the active rays,\r\nand so long as the body is under their influence. In this respect it\r\ndiffers from _phosphorescence_, in which light is emitted without\r\nsuch dependence. The phenomenon occurs in a conspicuous and\r\nbeautiful manner in certain kinds of fluor spar: and the term\r\n_fluorescence_, suggested by Professor Stokes, has the advantage of\r\ninserting no hypothesis, and will probably be found the most\r\ngenerally acceptable.[7\\B]\r\n\r\n[Note 4\\B: _Phil.

Trans._ 1852.]\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that Professor Stokes rejects altogether the\r\ndoctrine that light of definite refrangibility may still be\r\ncompound, and maybe analysed by absorption. He says, \"I have not\r\noverlooked the remarkable effect of absorbing media in causing\r\napparent changes {603} of color in a pure spectrum; but this I\r\nbelieve to be a subjective phenomenon depending upon contrast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nUNDULATORY THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direction of the Transverse Vibrations in Polarization._\r\n\r\nIN the conclusion of Chapter xiii. I have stated that there is a\r\npoint in the undulatory theory which was regarded as left undecided\r\nby Young and Fresnel, and on which the two different opinions have\r\nbeen maintained by different mathematicians; namely, whether the\r\nvibrations of polarized light are perpendicular to the plane of\r\npolarization or in that plane. Professor Stokes of Cambridge has\r\nattempted to solve this question in a manner which is,\r\ntheoretically, exceedingly ingenious, though it is difficult to make\r\nthe requisite experiments in a decisive manner. The method may be\r\nbriefly described.\r\n\r\nIf polarized light be _diffracted_ (see Chap. xi. sect. 2), each ray\r\nwill be bent from its position, but will still be polarized. The\r\noriginal ray and the diffracted ray, thus forming a broken line, may\r\nbe supposed to be connected at the angle by a universal joint\r\n(called a _Hooke's Joint_), such that when the original ray turns\r\nabout its axis, the diffracted ray also turns about its axis; as in\r\nthe case of the long handle of a telescope and the screw which is\r\nturned by it. Now if the motion of the original ray round its axis\r\nbe uniform, the motion of the diffracted ray round its axis is not\r\nuniform: and hence if, in a series of cases, the planes of\r\npolarization of the original ray differ by equal angles, in the\r\ndiffracted ray the planes of polarization will differ by unequal\r\nangles. Then if vibrations be perpendicular to the plane of\r\npolarization, the planes of polarization in the diffracted rays will\r\nbe crowded together in the neighborhood of the plane in which the\r\ndiffraction takes place, and will be more rarely distributed in the\r\nneighborhood of the plane perpendicular to this, in which is the\r\ndiffracting thread or groove.\r\n\r\nOn making the experiment, Prof. Stokes conceived that he found, in\r\nhis experiments, such a crowding of the planes of diffracted\r\npolarization towards the plane of diffraction; and thus he held that\r\nthe {604} hypothesis that the transverse vibrations which constitute\r\npolarization are perpendicularly transverse to the plane of\r\npolarization was confirmed.[8\\B]\r\n\r\n[Note 8\\B: _Camb. Trans._, vol. ix. part i. 1849.]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Holtzmann,[9\\B] who, assenting to the reasoning, has made\r\nthe experiment in a somewhat different manner, has obtained an\r\nopposite result; so that the point may be regarded as still\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[Note 9\\B: _Phil. Mag._, Feb. 1857.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Final Disproof of the Emission Theory._\r\n\r\nAs I have stated in the History, we cannot properly say that there\r\never was an Emission Theory of Light which was the _rival_ of the\r\nUndulatory Theory: for while the undulatory theory provided\r\nexplanations of new classes of phenomena as fast as they arose, and\r\nexhibited a _consilience_ of theories in these explanations, the\r\nhypothesis of emitted particles required new machinery for every new\r\nset of facts, and soon ceased to be capable even of expressing the\r\nfacts. The simple cases of the ordinary reflexion and refraction of\r\nlight were explained by Newton on the supposition that the\r\ntransmission of light is the motion of particles: and though his\r\nexplanation includes a somewhat harsh assumption (that a refracting\r\nsurface exercises an attractive force through a _fixed finite_\r\nspace), the authority of his great name gave it a sort of permanent\r\nnotoriety, and made it to be regarded as a standard point of\r\ncomparison between a supposed \"Emission Theory\" and the undulation\r\ntheory. And the way in which the theories were to be tested in this\r\ncase was obvious: in the Newtonian theory, the velocity of light is\r\nincreased by the refracting medium; in the undulatory theory, it is\r\ndiminished. On the former hypothesis the velocity of light in air\r\nand in water is as 3 to 4; in the latter, as 4 to 3.\r\n\r\nBut the immense velocity of light made it appear impossible to\r\nmeasure it, within the limits of any finite space which we can\r\noccupy with refracting matter. The velocity of light is known from\r\nastronomical phenomena;--from the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites,\r\nby which it appears that light occupies 8 minutes in coming from the\r\nsun to the earth; and from the aberration of light, by which its\r\nvelocity is shown to be 10,000 times the velocity of the earth in\r\nits orbit. Is it, then, possible to make apparent so small a\r\ndifference as that between its passing through a few yards of air\r\nand of water?\r\n\r\nMr. Wheatstone, in 1831, invented a machine by which this could\r\n{605} be done. His object was to determine the velocity of the\r\nelectric shock. His apparatus consisted in a small mirror, turning\r\nwith great velocity about an axis which is in its own plane, like a\r\ncoin spinning on its edge. The velocity of spinning may be made so\r\ngreat, that an object reflected shall change its place perceptibly\r\nafter an almost inconceivably small fraction of a second. The\r\napplication of this contrivance to measure the velocity of light,\r\nwas, at the suggestion of Arago, who had seen the times of the rival\r\ntheories of light, undertaken by younger men at Paris, his eyesight\r\nnot allowing him to prosecute such a task himself. It was necessary\r\nthat the mirrors should turn more than 1000 times in a second, in\r\norder that the two images, produced, one by light coming through\r\nair, and the other by light coming through an equal length of water,\r\nshould have places perceptibly different. The mechanical\r\ndifficulties of the experiment consisted in keeping up this great\r\nvelocity by the machinery without destroying the machinery, and in\r\ntransmitting the light without too much enfeebling it. These\r\ndifficulties were overcome in 1850, by M. Fizeau and M. Léon\r\nFoucault separately: and the result was, that the velocity of light\r\nwas found to be less in water than in air. And thus the Newtonian\r\nexplanation of refraction, the last remnant of the Emission Theory,\r\nwas proved to be false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{606}}\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nTHERMOTICS.--ATMOLOGY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF VAPOUR AND AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 4.--_Force of Steam._\r\n\r\nTHE experiments on the elastic force of steam made by the French\r\nAcademy are fitted in an especial manner to decide the question\r\nbetween rival formulæ, in consequence of the great amount of force\r\nto which they extend; namely, 60 feet of mercury, or 24 atmospheres:\r\nfor formulæ which give results almost indistinguishable in the lower\r\npart of the scale diverge widely at those elevated points. Mr.\r\nWaterston[10\\B] has reduced both these and other experiments to a\r\nrule in the following manner:--He takes the zero of gaseous tension,\r\ndetermined by other experimenters (Rudberg, Magnus, and Regnault,)\r\nto be 461° below the zero of Fahrenheit, or 274° below the zero of\r\nthe centigrade scale: and temperatures reckoned from this zero he\r\ncalls \"G temperatures.\" The square root of the G temperatures is the\r\nelement to which the elastic force is referred (for certain\r\ntheoretical reasons), and it is found that the density of steam is\r\nas the _sixth power_ of this element. The agreement of this rule\r\nwith the special results is strikingly close. A like rule was found\r\nby him to apply generally to many other gases in contact with their\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\n[Note 10\\B: _Phil. Trans._ 1852.]\r\n\r\nBut M. Regnault has recently investigated the subject in the most\r\ncomplete and ample manner, and has obtained results somewhat\r\ndifferent.[11\\B] He is led to the conclusion that no formula\r\nproceeding by {607} a power of the temperature can represent the\r\nexperiments. He also finds that the rule of Dalton (that as the\r\ntemperatures increase in arithmetical progression, the elastic force\r\nincreases in geometric progression) deviates from the observations,\r\nespecially at high temperatures. Dalton's rule would be expressed by\r\nsaying that the variable part of the elastic force is as _a^t_, where\r\n_t_ is the temperature. This failing, M. Regnault makes trial of a\r\nformula suggested by M. Biot, consisting of a sum of two terms, one of\r\nwhich is as _a^t_, and the other is _b^t_: and in this way satisfies\r\nthe experiments very closely. But this can only be considered as a\r\nformula of interpolation, and has no theoretical basis. M. Roche had\r\nproposed a formula in which the force is as _a^z_, _z_ depending upon\r\nthe temperature by an equation[12\\B] to which he had been led by\r\ntheoretical considerations. This agrees better with observation than\r\nany other formula which includes only the same number of coefficients.\r\n\r\n[Note 11\\B: _Mém. de l'Institut_, vol. xxi. (1847). M. Regnault's\r\nMemoir occupies 767 pages.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12\\B: The equation _z_ = _t_ ⁄ (1 + _mt_).]\r\n\r\nAmong the experimental thermotical laws referred to by M. Regnault\r\nare, the Law of Watt,[13\\B] that \"the quantity of heat which is\r\nrequired to convert a pint of water at a temperature of zero into\r\nsteam, is the same whatever be the pressure.\" Also, the Law of\r\nSouthern, that \"the latent heat of vaporization, that is the heat\r\nabsorbed in the passage from the liquid to the gaseous consistence,\r\nis constant for all purposes: and that we obtain the total heat in\r\nadding to the constant latent heat the number which represents the\r\nlatent heat of steam.\" Southern found the latent heat of the steam\r\nof water to be represented by about 950 degrees of Fahrenheit.[14\\B]\r\n\r\n[Note 13\\B: See Robison's _Mechanical Philosophy_, vol. ii. p. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14\\B: Ib. p. 160.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sect._ 5.--_Temperature of the Atmosphere._\r\n\r\nI MAY notice, as important additions to our knowledge on this\r\nsubject, the results of four balloon ascents made in 1852,[15\\B] by\r\nthe Committee of the Meteorological Observatory established at Kew\r\nby the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In these\r\nascents the observers mounted to more than 13,000, 18,000, and\r\n19,000 feet, and in the last to 22,370; by which ascent the\r\ntemperature fell from 49 degrees to nearly 10 degrees below zero;\r\nand the dew-point fell from 37° to 12°. Perhaps the most marked\r\nresult of these observations is the {608} following:--The temperature\r\nof the air decreases uniformly as we ascend above the earth's\r\nsurface; but this decrease does not go on continuously. At a certain\r\nelevation, varying on different days, the decrease is arrested: and\r\nfor a depth of two or three thousand feet of air, the temperature\r\ndecreases little, or even increases in ascending. Above this, the\r\ndiminution again takes place at nearly the same rate as in the lower\r\nregions. This intermediate region of undecreasing temperature\r\nextended in the various ascents, from about altitude 4000 to 6000\r\nfeet, 6500 to 10,000, 2000 to 4500, and 4000 to 8000. This\r\ninterruption in the decrease of temperature is accompanied by a\r\nlarge and abrupt fall in the temperature of the dew-point, or by an\r\nactual condensation of vapor. Thus, this region is the _region of\r\nthe clouds_, and the increase of heat appears to arise from the\r\nlatent heat liberated when aqueous vapor is formed into clouds.\r\n\r\n[Note 15\\B: _Phil. Trans._ 1853.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dynamical Theory of Heat._\r\n\r\nTHAT the transmission of _radiant_ Heat takes place by means of the\r\nvibrations of a medium, as the transmission of Sound certainly does,\r\nand the transmission of Light most probably, is a theory which, as I\r\nhave endeavored to explain, has strong arguments and analogies in\r\nits favor. But that Heat itself, in its essence and quantity, is\r\nMotion is a hypothesis of quite another kind. This hypothesis has\r\nbeen recently asserted and maintained with great ability. The\r\ndoctrine thus asserted is, that Motion may be converted into Heat,\r\nand Heat into Motion; that Heat and Motion may produce each other,\r\nas we see in the rarefaction and condensation of air, in\r\nsteam-engines, and the like: and that in all such cases the Motion\r\nproduced and the Heat expended exactly measure each other. The\r\nfoundation of this theory is conceived to have been laid by Mr.\r\nJoule of Manchester, in 1844: and it has since been prosecuted by\r\nhim and by Professor Thomson of Glasgow, by experimental\r\ninvestigations of various kinds. It is difficult to make these\r\nexperiments so as to be quite satisfactory; for it is {609}\r\ndifficult to measure _all_ the heat gained or lost in any of the\r\nchanges here contemplated. That friction, agitation of fluids,\r\ncondensation of gases, conversion of gases into fluids and liquids\r\ninto solids, produce heat, is undoubted: and that the quantity of\r\nsuch heat may be measured by the mechanical force which produces it,\r\nor which it produces, is a generalization which will very likely be\r\nfound a fertile source of new propositions, and probably of\r\nimportant consequences.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the conclusions which Professor Thomson draws from\r\nthis doctrine of the mutual conversion of motion and heat, I may\r\nmention his speculations concerning the cause which produces and\r\nsustains the heat of the sun.[16\\B] He conceives that the support of\r\nthe solar heat must be meteoric matter which is perpetually falling\r\ntowards the globe of the sun, and has its motion converted into\r\nheat. He inclines to think that the meteors containing the stores of\r\nenergy for future Sun-light must be principally within the earth's\r\norbit; and that we actually see them there as the \"Zodiacal Light,\"\r\nan illuminated shower, or rather tornado, of stones. The inner parts\r\nof this tornado are always getting caught in the Sun's atmosphere,\r\nand drawn to his mass by gravitation.\r\n\r\n[Note 16\\B: On the Mechanical Energies of the Solar System. _Edinb.\r\nTrans._ vol.

Such\r\nare, for instance, Atmospheric Electricity, with all that belongs to\r\nThunderstorms and Lightning Conductors. The observation of\r\nAtmospheric Electricity has been prosecuted with great zeal at\r\nvarious meteorological observatories; and especially at the\r\nObservatory established by the British Association at Kew. The\r\nAurora Borealis, again, is plainly an electrical phenomenon; but\r\nprobably belonging rather to dynamical than to statical electricity.\r\nFor it strongly affects the magnetic needle, and its position has\r\nreference to the direction of magnetism; but it has not been\r\nobserved to affect the electroscope. The general features of this\r\nphenomenon have been described by M. de Humboldt, and more recently\r\nby M. de Bravais; and theories of the mode of its production have\r\nbeen propounded by MM. Biot, De la Rive, Kaemtz, and others.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are several fishes which have the power of giving an\r\nelectrical shock:--the torpedo, the gymnotus, and the silurus. The\r\nagency of these creatures has been identified with electricity in\r\nthe most general sense. The peculiar energy of the animal has been\r\nmade to produce the effects which are produced by an electrical\r\ndischarge or a voltaic current:--not only to destroy life in small\r\nanimals, but to {611} deflect a magnet, to make a magnet, to\r\ndecompose water, and to produce a spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Faraday's Views of Statical Electric Induction._\r\n\r\nAccording to the theories of electricity of Æpinus and Coulomb,\r\nwhich in this Book of our History are regarded as constituting a\r\nmain part of the progress of this portion of science, the particles\r\nof the electric fluid or fluids exert forces, attractive and\r\nrepulsive, upon each other in straight lines at a distance, in the\r\nsame way in which, in the Newtonian theory of the universe, the\r\nparticles of matter are conceived as exerting attractive forces upon\r\neach other. An electrized body presented a conducting body of any\r\nform, determines a new arrangement of the electric fluids in the\r\nconductor, attracting the like fluid to its own side, and repelling\r\nthe opposite fluid to the opposite side. This is Electrical\r\n_Induction_. And as, by the theory, the attraction is greater at the\r\nsmaller distances, the distribution of the fluid upon the conductor\r\nin virtue of this Induction will not be symmetrical, but will be\r\ngoverned by laws which it will require a complex and difficult\r\ncalculation to determine--as we have seen was the case in the\r\ninvestigations of Coulomb, Poisson, and others.\r\n\r\nInstead of this action at a distance. Dr. Faraday has been led to\r\nconceive Electrical Induction to be the result of an action taking\r\nplace between the electrized body and the conductor through lines of\r\ncontiguous particles in the mass of the intermediate body, which he\r\ncalls the _Dielectric_. And the irregularities of the distribution\r\nof the electricity in these cases of Induction, and indeed the\r\nexistence of an action in points protected from direct action by the\r\nprotuberant sides of the conductor, are the causes, I conceive,\r\nwhich lead him to the conclusion that Induction takes place in\r\n_curved lines_[17\\B] of such contiguous particles.\r\n\r\n[Note 17\\B: _Researches_, 1165, &c.]\r\n\r\nWith reference to this, I may remark that, as I have said, the\r\ndistribution of electricity on a conductor in the presence of an\r\nelectrized body is so complex a mathematical problem that I do not\r\nconceive any merely popular way of regarding the result can entitle\r\nus to say, that the distribution which we find cannot be explained\r\nby the Coulombian theory, and must force us upon the assumption of\r\nan action in curved lines:--which is, indeed, itself a theory, and\r\nso vague a one {612} that it requires to be made much more precise\r\nbefore we can say what consequences it does or does not lead to.\r\nProfessor W. Thomson has arrived at a mathematical proof that the\r\neffect of induction on the view of Coulomb and of Faraday must,\r\nunder certain conditions, be necessarily and universally the same.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the influence of different _Dielectrics_ upon\r\nInduction, the inquiry appears to be of the highest importance; and\r\nmay certainly necessitate some addition to the theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{613}}\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Progress of Terrestrial Magnetism._\r\n\r\nIN Chapter II., I have noticed the history of Terrestrial Magnetism;\r\nHansteen's map published in 1819; the discovery of \"magnetic storms\"\r\nabout 1825; the chain of associated magnetic observations, suggested\r\nby M. de Humboldt, and promoted by the British Association and the\r\nRoyal Society; the demand for the continuation of these till 1848;\r\nthe magnetic observations made in several voyages; the magnetic\r\nsurveys of various countries. And I have spoken also of Gauss's\r\ntheory of Terrestrial Magnetism, and his directions and requirements\r\nconcerning the observations to be made. I may add a few words with\r\nregard to the more recent progress of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic observations made over large portions of the Earth's\r\nsurface by various persons, and on the Ocean by British officers,\r\nhave been transmitted to Woolwich, where they have been employed by\r\nGeneral Sabine in constructing magnetic maps of the Earth for the\r\nyear 1840.[18\\B] Following the course of inquiry described in the\r\npart of the history referred to, these maps exhibit the declination,\r\ninclination, and intensity of the magnetic force at every point of\r\nthe earth's surface. The curves which mark equal amounts of each of\r\nthese three elements (the _lines of equal declination_,\r\n_inclination_, and _force_:--the _isogonal_, the _isoclinal_, and\r\nthe _isodynamic_ lines,) are, in their general form, complex and\r\nirregular; and it has been made a matter of question (the facts\r\nbeing agreed upon) whether it be more proper to say that they\r\nindicate four poles, as Halley and as Hansteen said, or only two\r\npoles, as Gauss asserts. The matter appears to become more clear if\r\nwe draw magnetic _meridians_; that is, lines obtained by following\r\nthe directions, or pointings, of the magnetic needle to the north or\r\nto {614} the south, till we arrive at the points of convergence of\r\nall their directions; for there are only two such poles, one in the\r\nArctic and one in the Antarctic region. But in consequence of the\r\nirregularity of the magnetic constitution of the earth, if we follow\r\nthe inclination of the magnetic force round the earth on any\r\nparallel of latitude, we find that it has two _maxima_ and two\r\n_minima_, as if there were four magnetic poles. The isodynamic map\r\nis a new presentation of the facts of this subject; the first having\r\nbeen constructed by Colonel Sabine in 1837.\r\n\r\n[Note 18\\B: These maps are published in Mr. Keith Johnstone's\r\n_Physical Atlas_.]\r\n\r\nI have stated also that the magnetic elements at each place are to\r\nbe observed in such a manner as to bring into view both their\r\n_periodical_, their _secular_, and their _irregular_ or _occasional_\r\nchanges. The observations made at Toronto in Canada, and at Hobart\r\nTown in Van Diemen's Land, two stations at equal distances from the\r\ntwo poles of the earth, and also at St Helena, a station within the\r\ntropics, have been discussed by General Sabine with great care, and\r\nwith an amount of labor approaching to that employed upon reductions\r\nof astronomical observations. And the results have been curious and\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\nThe declination was first examined.[19\\B] This magnetical element is,\r\nas we have already seen (p. 232), liable both to a diurnal and to an\r\nannual inequality; and also to irregular perturbations which have been\r\ntermed magnetic storms. Now it was found that all these inequalities\r\nwent on increasing gradually and steadily from 1843 to 1848, so as to\r\nbecome, at the end of that time, above twice as large as they were at\r\nthe beginning of it. A new periodical change in all these elements\r\nappeared to be clearly established by this examination. M. Lamont, of\r\nMunich, had already remarked indications of a decennial period in the\r\ndiurnal variation of the declination of the needle. The duration of\r\nthe period from minimum to maximum being about five years, and\r\ntherefore the whole period about ten years. The same conclusion was\r\nfound to follow still more decidedly from the observations of the dip\r\nand intensity.\r\n\r\n[Note 19\\B: _Phil. Trans._ 1852 and 1856.]\r\n\r\nThis period of ten years had no familiar meaning in astronomy; and\r\nif none such had been found for it, its occurrence as a magnetic\r\nperiod must have been regarded, as General Sabine says,[20\\B] in the\r\nlight of a fragmentary fact. But it happened about this time that\r\nthe scientific world was made aware of the existence of a like\r\nperiod in a {615} phenomenon which no one would have guessed to be\r\nconnected with terrestrial magnetism, namely, the spots in the Sun.\r\nM. Schwabe, of Dessau, had observed the Sun's disk with immense\r\nperseverance for 24 years:--often examining it more than 300 days in\r\nthe year; and had found that the spots had, as to their quantity and\r\nfrequency, a periodical character. The years of maximum are 1828,\r\n1838, 1848, in which there were respectively 225,[21\\B] 282, 330\r\ngroups of spots. The minimum years, 1833, 1843, had only 33 and 34\r\nsuch groups. This curious fact[22\\B] was first made public by M. de\r\nHumboldt, in the third volume of his _Kosmos_ (1850). The\r\ncoincidence of the periods and epochs of these two classes of facts\r\nwas pointed out by General Sabine in a Memoir presented to the Royal\r\nSociety in March, 1852.\r\n\r\n[Note 20\\B: _Phil. Trans._ 1856, p. 382.]\r\n\r\n[Note 21\\B: In 1837 there were 333.]\r\n\r\n[Note 22\\B: The observations up to 1844 were published in\r\nPoggendorf's _Annalen_.]\r\n\r\nOf course it was natural to suppose, even before this discovery,\r\nthat the diurnal and annual inequalities of the magnetic element at\r\neach place depend upon the action of the sun, in some way or other.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday had endeavored to point out how the effect of the solar\r\nheat upon the atmosphere would, according to the known relations of\r\nheat and magnetism, explain many of the phenomena. But this new\r\nfeature of the phenomena, their quinquennial increase and decrease,\r\nmakes us doubt whether such an explanation can really be the true one.\r\n\r\nOf the _secular_ changes in the magnetic elements, not much more is\r\nknown than was known some years ago. These changes go on, but their\r\nlaws are imperfectly known, and their causes not even conjectured.\r\nM. Hansteen, in a recent memoir,[23\\B] says that the decrease of the\r\ninclination goes on progressively diminishing. With us this rate of\r\ndecrease appears to be at present nearly uniform. We cannot help\r\nconjecturing that the sun, which has so plain a connexion with the\r\ndiurnal, annual, and occasional movements of the needle, must also\r\nhave some connexion with its secular movements.\r\n\r\n[Note 23\\B: See K. Johnstone's _Physical Atlas_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the observations made at various places had to a great\r\nextent enabled Gauss, in connexion with W. Weber, to apply his\r\nTheory to the actual condition of the Earth;[24\\B]  and he\r\ncalculated the Declination, Inclination, and Intensity at above 100\r\nplaces, and found {616} the agreement, as he says, far beyond his\r\nhopes. They show, he says, that the Theory comes near to the Truth.\r\n\r\n[Note 24\\B: _Atlas des Erdmagnetismus nach den Elementen der Theorie\r\nEntworfen_. See Preface.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correction of Ship's Compasses._\r\n\r\nThe magnetic needle had become of importance when it was found that\r\nit always pointed to the North. Since that time the history of\r\nmagnetism has had its events reflected in the history of navigation.\r\nThe change of the declination arising from a change of place\r\nterrified the companions of Columbus. The determination of the laws\r\nof this change was the object of the voyage of Halley; and has been\r\npursued with the utmost energy in the Arctic and Antarctic regions\r\nby navigators up to the present time. Probably the dependence of the\r\nmagnetic declination upon place is now known well enough for the\r\npurposes of navigation. But a new source of difficulty has in the\r\nmeantime come into view; the effect of the iron in the ship upon the\r\nCompass. And this has gone on increasing as guns, cables, stays,\r\nknees, have been made of iron; then steam-engines with funnels,\r\nwheels, and screws, have been added; and finally the whole ship has\r\nbeen made of iron. How can the compass be trusted in such cases?\r\n\r\nI have already said in the history that Mr. Barlow proposed to\r\ncorrect the error of the compass by placing near to the compass an\r\niron plate, which from its proximity to the compass might\r\ncounterbalance magnetically the whole effect of the ship's iron upon\r\nthe compass. This correction was not effectual, because the magnetic\r\nforces of the plate and of the ship do not change their direction\r\nand value according to the same law, with the change of position. I\r\nhave further stated that Mr. Airy devised other means of correcting\r\nthe error. I may add a few words on the subject; for the subject has\r\nbeen further examined by Mr. Airy[25\\B] and by others.\r\n\r\n[Note 25\\B: _Phil. Trans._ 1856.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, by mathematical reasoning, that the magnetic effect of\r\nthe iron in a ship may be regarded as producing two kinds of\r\ndeviation which are added together;--a \"polar-magnet deviation,\"\r\nwhich changes from positive to negative as the direction of the\r\nship's keel, in a horizontal revolution, passes from semicircle to\r\nsemicircle; and a \"quadrantal deviation,\" which changes from\r\npositive to negative as the keel turns from quadrant to quadrant.\r\nThe latter deviation may be remedied completely by a mass of\r\nunmagnetized iron placed on a level {617} with the compass, either\r\nin the athwartship line or in the fore-and-aft line, according to\r\ncircumstances. \"The polar-magnet-deviation\" may be corrected at _any\r\ngiven place_ by a magnet or magnets, but the magnets thus applied at\r\none place will not always correct the deviation in another magnetic\r\nlatitude. For it appears that this deviation arises partly from a\r\nmagnetism inherent in the materials of the ship, not changing with\r\nthe change of magnetic position, and partly from the effect of\r\nterrestrial magnetism upon the ship's iron. But the errors arising\r\nfrom both sources may be remedied by adjusting, at a new locality,\r\nthe positions of the corrective magnets.\r\n\r\nThe inherent magnetism of the ship, of which I have spoken, may be\r\nmuch affected by the position in which the ship was built; and may\r\nchange from time to time; for instance, by the effect of the\r\nbattering of the waves, and other causes. Hence it is called by Mr.\r\nAiry \"sub-permanent magnetism.\"\r\n\r\nAnother method of correcting the errors of a ship's compass has been\r\nproposed, and is used to some extent; namely, by _swinging_ the ship\r\nround (in harbor) to all points of azimuth, and thus constructing a\r\n_Table of Compass Errors_ for that particular ship. But to this\r\nmethod it is objected that the Table loses its value in a new\r\nmagnetic latitude much more than the correction by magnets does;\r\nbesides the inconveniences of steering a ship by a Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{618}}\r\nBOOK XIII.\r\n\r\nVOLTAIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMAGNETO-ELECTRIC INDUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARADAY'S discovery that, in combinations like those in which a\r\nvoltaic current was known to produce motion, motion would produce a\r\nvoltaic current, naturally excited great attention among the\r\nscientific men of Europe. The general nature of his discovery was\r\ncommunicated by letter[26\\B] to M. Hachette at Paris, in December,\r\n1831; and experiments having the like results were forthwith made by\r\nMM. Becquerel and Ampère at Paris, and MM. Nobili and Antinori at\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\n[Note 26\\B: _Ann. de Chimie_, vol. xlviii. (1831), p. 402.]\r\n\r\nIt was natural also that in a case in which the relations of space\r\nwhich determine the results are so complicated, different\r\nphilosophers should look at them in different ways. There had been,\r\nfrom the first discovery by Oersted of the effect of a voltaic\r\ncurrent upon a magnet, two rival methods of regarding the facts.\r\nElectric and magnetic lines exert an effort to place themselves\r\ntransverse to each other (see chapter iv. of this Book), and (as I\r\nhave already said) two ways offered themselves of simplifying this\r\ngeneral truth:--to suppose an electric current made up of transverse\r\nmagnetic lines; or to suppose magnetic lines made up of transverse\r\nelectric currents. On either of these assumptions, the result was\r\nexpressed by saying that _like_ currents or lines (electric or\r\nmagnetic) tend to place themselves parallel; which is a law more\r\ngenerally intelligible than the law of transverse position. Faraday\r\nhad adopted the former view; had taken the lines of magnetic force\r\nfor the fundamental lines of his system, and defined the direction\r\nof the magneto-electric current of induction by the relation {619}\r\nof the motion to these lines. Ampère, on the other hand, supposed\r\nthe magnet to be made up of transverse electric currents (chap.\r\nvi.); and had deduced all the facts of electro-dynamical action,\r\nwith great felicity, from this conception. The question naturally\r\narose, in what manner, on this view, were the new facts of\r\nmagneto-electric induction by motion to be explained, or even\r\nexpressed?\r\n\r\nVarious philosophers attempted to answer this question. Perhaps the\r\nform in which the answer has obtained most general acceptance is\r\nthat in which it was put by Lenz, who discoursed on the subject to\r\nthe Academy of St. Petersburg in 1833.[27\\B] His general rule is to\r\nthis effect: when a wire moves in the neighborhood of an electric\r\ncurrent or a magnet, a current takes place in it, such as, existing\r\nindependently, would have produced a motion opposite to the actual\r\nmotion. Thus two parallel _forward_ currents move towards each\r\nother:--hence if a current move towards a parallel wire, it produces\r\nin it a _backward_ current. A moveable wire conducting a current\r\n_downwards_ will move round the north pole of a magnet in the\r\ndirection N., W., S., E.:--hence if, when the wire have in it no\r\ncurrent, we move it in the direction N., W., S., E., we produce in\r\nthe wire an _upward_ current. And thus, as M. de la Rive\r\nremarks,[28\\B] in cases in which the mutual action of two currents\r\nproduces a limited motion, as attraction or repulsion, or a\r\ndeviation right or left, the corresponding magneto-electric\r\ninduction produces an instantaneous current only; but when the\r\nelectrodynamic action produces a continued motion, the corresponding\r\nmotion produces, by induction, a continued current.\r\n\r\n[Note 27\\B: _Acad. Petrop._ Nov. 29, 1833. _Pogg. Ann._ vol. xxxi.\r\np. 483.]\r\n\r\n[Note 28\\B: _Traité de l'Electricité_, vol. i. p. 441 (1854).]\r\n\r\nLooking at this mode of stating the law, it is impossible not to\r\nregard this effect as a sort of reaction; and accordingly, this view\r\nwas at once taken of it. Professor Ritchie said, in 1833, \"The law\r\nis founded on the universal principle that action and reaction are\r\nequal.\" Thus, if voltaic electricity induce magnetism under certain\r\narrangements, magnetism will, by similar arrangements, react on a\r\nconductor and induce voltaic electricity.[29\\B]\r\n\r\n[Note 29\\B: On the Reduction of Mr. Faraday's discoveries in\r\nMagneto-electric Induction to a General Law. _Trans._ of R. S. in\r\n_Phil. Mag._ N.S. vol. iii. 37, and vol. iv. p. 11. In the second\r\nedition of this history I used the like expressions.]\r\n\r\nThere are still other ways of looking at this matter. I have\r\nelsewhere pointed out that where polar properties co-exist, they are\r\n{620} generally found to be connected,[30\\B] and have illustrated\r\nthis law in the case of electrical, magnetical, and chemical\r\npolarities. If we regard motion backwards and forwards, to the right\r\nand the left, and the like, as _polar_ relations, we see that\r\nmagneto-electric induction gives us a new manifestation of connected\r\npolarities.\r\n\r\n[Note 30\\B: _Phil. Ind. Sc._ B. v. c. ii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diamagnetic Polarity_.\r\n\r\nBut the manifestation of co-existent polarities which are brought into\r\nview in this most curious department of nature is not yet exhausted by\r\nthose which we have described. I have already spoken (chap. **vii.) of\r\nDr. Faraday's discovery that there are diamagnetic as well as magnetic\r\nbodies; bodies which are repelled by the pole of a magnet, as well as\r\nbodies which are attracted. Here is a new opposition of properties.\r\nWhat is the exact definition of this opposition in connexion with\r\nother polarities? To this, at present, different philosophers give\r\ndifferent answers. Some say that diamagnetism is completely the\r\nopposite of ordinary magnetism, or, as Dr. Faraday has termed it for\r\nthe sake of distinction, of _paramagnetism_. They say that as a north\r\npole of a magnet gives to the neighboring extremity of a piece of soft\r\niron a south pole, so it gives to the neighboring extremity of a piece\r\nof bismuth a north pole, and that the bismuth becomes for a time an\r\ninverted magnet; and hence, arranges itself across the line of\r\nmagnetised force, instead of along it. Dr. Faraday himself at first\r\nadopted this view;[31\\B] but he now conceives that the bismuth is not\r\nmade polar, but is simply repelled by the magnet; and that the\r\ntransverse position which it assumes, arises merely from its elongated\r\nform, each end trying to recede as far as possible from the repulsive\r\npole of the magnet.\r\n\r\n[Note 31\\B: Faraday's _Researches_, Art. 2429, 2430.]\r\n\r\nSeveral philosophers of great eminence, however, who have examined\r\nthe subject with great care, adhere to Dr. Faraday's first view of\r\nthe nature of Diamagnetism--as W. Weber,[32\\B] Plücker, and Mr.\r\nTyndall among ourselves. If we translate this view into the language\r\nof Ampère's theory, it comes to this:--that as currents are induced\r\nin iron and magnetics parallel to those existing in the inducing\r\nmagnet or battery wire; so in bismuth, heavy glass, and other\r\ndiamagnetic bodies, the currents induced are in the contrary {621}\r\ndirections:--these hypothetical currents being in non-conducting\r\ndiamagnetic, as in magnetic bodies, not in the mass, but round the\r\nparticles of the matter.\r\n\r\n[Note 32\\B: Poggendorf's _Ann. Jou._ 1848.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magneto-optic Effects and Magnecrystallic Polarity._\r\n\r\nNot even yet have we terminated the enumeration of the co-existent\r\npolarities which in this province of nature have been brought into\r\nview. Light has polar properties; the very term _polarization_ is\r\nthe record of the discovery of these. The forces which determine the\r\ncrystalline forms of bodies are of a polar nature: crystalline\r\nforms, when complete, may be defined as those forms which have a\r\ncertain degree of symmetry in reference to opposite poles. Now has\r\nthis optical and crystalline polarity any relation to the electrical\r\npolarity of which we have been speaking?\r\n\r\nHowever much we might be disposed beforehand to conjecture that\r\nthere is some relation between these two groups of polar properties,\r\nyet in this as in the other parts of this history of discoveries\r\nrespecting polarities, no conjecture hits the nature of the\r\nrelation, such as experiment showed it to be. In November, 1846,\r\nFaraday announced the discovery of what he then called \"the action\r\nof magnets on light.\" But this action was manifested, not on light\r\ndirectly, but on light passing through certain kinds of glass.[33\\B]\r\nWhen this glass, subjected to the action of the powerful magnets\r\nwhich he used, transmitted a ray of light parallel to the line of\r\nmagnetic force, an effect was produced upon the light. But of what\r\nnature was this effect? When light was ordinary light, no change in\r\nits condition was discoverable. But if the light were light\r\npolarized in any plane, the plane of polarization was turned round\r\nthrough a certain angle while the ray passed through the glass:--a\r\ngreater angle, in proportion as the magnetic force was greater, and\r\nthe thickness of the glass greater.\r\n\r\n[Note 33\\B: Silicated borate of lead. See _Researches_, § 2151, &c.\r\nAlso flint glass, rock salt, water (2215).]\r\n\r\nA power in some respects of this kind, namely, a power to rotate the\r\nplane of polarization of a ray passing through them, is possessed by\r\nsome bodies in their natural state; for instance, quartz crystals,\r\nand oil of turpentine. But yet, as Dr. Faraday remarks,[34\\B] there\r\nis a great difference in the two cases. When polarized rays pass\r\nthrough oil of turpentine, in whatever direction they pass, they all\r\nof them have their {622} plane of polarization rotated in the same\r\ndirection; that is, all to the right or all to the left; but when a\r\nray passes through the heavy glass, the power of rotation exists\r\nonly in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic line, and its\r\ndirection as right or left-handed is reversed by reversing the\r\nmagnetic polarity.\r\n\r\n[Note 34\\B: _Researches_, Art. 2231.]\r\n\r\nIn this case, we have optical properties, which do not depend on\r\ncrystalline form, affected by the magnetic force. But it has also been\r\nfound that crystalline form, which is so fertile a source of optical\r\nproperties, affords indications of magnetic forces. In 1847, M.\r\nPlücker,[35\\B] of the University of Bonn, using a powerful magnetic\r\napparatus, similar to Faraday's, found that crystals in general are\r\nmagnetic, in this sense, that the axes of crystalline form tend to\r\nassume a certain position with reference to the magnetic lines of\r\nforce. The possession of one optic axis or of two is one of the broad\r\ndistinctions of the different crystalline forms: and using this\r\ndistinction, M. Plücker found that a crystal having a single optic\r\naxis tends to place itself with this axis transverse to the magnetic\r\nline of force, as if its optic axis were repelled by each magnetic\r\npole; and crystals with two axes act as if each of these axes were\r\nrepelled by the magnetic poles. This force is independent of the\r\nmagnetic or diamagnetic character of the crystal; and is a directive,\r\nmore properly than an attractive or repulsive force.\r\n\r\n[Note 35\\B: Taylor's _Scientific Memoirs_, vol. v.]\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards (in 1848) Faraday also discovered[36\\B] an effect of\r\nmagnetism depending on crystalline form, which at first sight appeared\r\nto be different from the effects observed by M. Plücker. He found that\r\na crystal of bismuth, of which the form is nearly a cube, but more\r\ntruly a rhombohedron with one diagonal a little longer than the\r\nothers, tends to place itself with this diagonal in the direction of\r\nthe lines of magnetic force. At first he conceived[37\\B] the\r\nproperties thus detected to be different from those observed by M.\r\nPlücker; since in this case the force of a crystalline axis is axial,\r\nwhereas in those, it was equatorial. But a further consideration of\r\nthe subject, led him[38\\B] to a conviction that these forces must be\r\nfundamentally identical: for it was easy to conceive a combination of\r\nbismuth crystals which would behave in the magnetic field as a crystal\r\nof calcspar does; or a combination of calcspar crystals which would\r\nbehave as a crystal of bismuth does.\r\n\r\n[Note 36\\B: _Researches_, Art. 2454, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Note 37\\B: Art. 2469.]\r\n\r\n[Note 38\\B: Art 2593, 2601.]\r\n\r\nAnd thus we have fresh examples to show that the Connexion of\r\ncoexistent Polarities is a thought deeply seated in the minds of the\r\n{623} profoundest and most sagacious philosophers, and perpetually\r\nverified and illustrated, by unforeseen discoveries in unguessed\r\nforms, through the labors of the most skilful experimenters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magneto-electric Machines._\r\n\r\nThe discovery that a voltaic wire moved in presence of a magnet, has\r\na current generated in it, was employed as the ground of the\r\nconstruction of machines to produce electrical effects. In Saxton's\r\nmachine two coils of wire including a core of soft iron revolved\r\nopposite to the ends of a horseshoe magnet, and thus, as the two\r\ncoils came opposite to the N. and S. and to the S. and N. poles of\r\nthe magnet, currents were generated alternately in the wires in\r\nopposite directions. But by arranging the connexions of the ends of\r\nthe wires, the successive currents might be made to pass in\r\ncorresponding directions. The alternations or successions of\r\ncurrents in such machines are governed by a contrivance which\r\nalternately interrupts and permits the action; this contrivance has\r\nbeen called a _rheotome_. Clarke gave a new form to a machine of the\r\nsame nature as Saxton's. But the like effect may be produced by\r\nusing an electro-magnet instead of a common magnet. When this is\r\ndone, a current is produced which by induction produces a current in\r\nanother wire, and the action is alternately excited and interrupted.\r\nWhen the inducing current is interrupted, a momentary current _in an\r\nopposite direction_ is produced in the induced wire; and when this\r\ncurrent stops, it produces in the inducing wire a current _in the\r\noriginal direction_, which may be adjusted so as to reinforce the\r\nresumed action of the original current. This was pointed out by M.\r\nDe la Rive in 1843.[39\\B] Machines have been constructed on such\r\nprinciples by him and others. Of such machines the most powerful\r\nhitherto known is that constructed by M. Ruhmkorff. The effects of\r\nthis instrument are exceedingly energetic.\r\n\r\n[Note 39\\B: _Traité de l'Elect._ i. 391.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Applications of Electrodynamic Discoveries._\r\n\r\nThe great series of discoveries of which I have had to speak have\r\nbeen applied in many important ways to the uses of life. The\r\n_Electric Telegraph_ is one of the most remarkable of these. By\r\nwires extended to the most distant places, the electric current is\r\ntransmitted {624} thither in an imperceptible time; and by means of\r\nwell-devised systems of operation, is made to convey from man to man\r\nwords, which are now most emphatically \"winged words.\" In the most\r\ncivilised states such wires now form a net-work across the land,\r\nwhich is familiar to our thoughts as the highway is to our feet; and\r\nwide seas have such pathways of human thought buried deep in their\r\nwaves from shore to shore. Again, by using the chemical effects of\r\nelectrodynamic action, of which we shall have to speak in the next\r\nBook, a new means has been obtained of copying, with an exactness\r\nunattainable before, any forms which art or nature has produced, and\r\nof covering them with a surface of metal. The _Electrotype Process_\r\nis now one of the great powers which manufacturing art employs.\r\n\r\nBut these discoveries have also been employed in explaining natural\r\nphenomena, the causes of which had before been altogether\r\ninscrutable. This is the case with regard to the diurnal variation\r\nof the magnetic needle; a fact  which as to its existence is\r\nuniversal in all places, and which yet is so curiously diverse in\r\nits course at different places. Dr. Faraday has shown that some of\r\nthe most remarkable of these diversities, and probably all, seem to\r\nbe accounted for by the different magnetic effects of air at\r\ndifferent temperatures: although, as I have already said, **(Book\r\nxii.) the discovery of a decennial period in the diurnal changes of\r\nmagnetic declination shows that any explanation of those changes\r\nwhich refers them to causes existing in the atmosphere must be very\r\nincomplete.[40\\B]\r\n\r\n[Note 40\\B: _Researches_, Art. 2892.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{625}}\r\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRO-CHEMICAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG the consequences of the Electro-chemical Theory, must be\r\nranged the various improvements which have been made in the voltaic\r\nbattery. Daniel introduced between the two metals a partition\r\npermeable by chemical action, but such as to allow of two different\r\nacid solutions being in contact with the two metals. Mr. Grove's\r\nbattery, in which the partition is of porous porcelain, and the\r\nmetals are platinum and amalgamated zinc, is one of the most\r\npowerful hitherto known. Another has been constructed by Dr. Callan,\r\nin which the negative or conducting plate is a cylinder of cast\r\niron, and the positive element a cylinder of amalgamated zinc placed\r\nin a porous cell. This also has great energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Number of Elementary Substances._\r\n\r\nThere have not been, I believe, any well-established additions to\r\nthe list of the simple substances recognized by chemists. Indeed the\r\ntendency at present appears to be rather to deny the separate\r\nelementary character of some already announced as such substances.\r\nPelopium and Niobium were, as I have said, two of the new metals.\r\nBut Naumann, in his _Elemente der Mineralogie_ (4th ed. 1855), says,\r\nin a foot note (page 25): \"_Pelopium_ is happily again got rid of;\r\nfor Pelopic Acid and Niobic Acid possess the same Radical.\r\n_Donarium_ had a still shorter existence.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when Hermann imagined that he had discovered a new\r\nsimple metallic substance in the mineral Samarskite from Miask, the\r\ndiscovery was disproved by H. Rose (_Pogg. Ann._ B. 73, s. 449). {626}\r\n\r\nIn general the insulation of the new simple substances, the metallic\r\nbases of the earths, and the like,--their separation from their\r\ncombinations, and the exhibition of them in a metallic form--has been\r\na difficult chemical process, and has rarely been executed on any\r\nconsiderable scale. But in the case of _Aluminium_, the basis of the\r\nearth Alumina, the process of its extraction has recently been so much\r\nfacilitated, that the metal can be produced in abundance. This being\r\nthe case, it will probably soon be applied to special economical uses,\r\nfor which it is fitted by possessing special properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{626}}\r\nBOOK XV.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the kindness of W. H. Miller, Esq., Professor of Mineralogy in\r\nthe University of Cambridge, I am able to add to this part the\r\nfollowing notices of books and memoirs.\r\n\r\n1. _Crystallography._\r\n\r\n_Elemente der Krystallographie, nebst einer tabellarischen\r\nUebersicht der Mineralien nach der Krystallformen_, von Gustav Rose.\r\n2. Auflage. Berlin, 1838. The crystallographic method here adopted\r\nis, for the most part, that of Weiss. The method of this work has\r\nbeen followed in\r\n\r\n_A System of Crystallography, with its Applications to Mineralogy_.\r\nBy John Joseph Griffin. Glasgow, 1841. Mr. Griffin has, however,\r\nmodified the notation of Rose. He has constructed a series of models\r\nof crystalline forms.\r\n\r\nFrankenheim's _System der Krystalle_. 1842. This work adopts nearly\r\nthe Mohsian systems of crystallization. It contains Tables of the\r\nchemical constitution, inclinations of the axis, and magnitude of\r\nthe axes of all the crystals of which a description was to be found,\r\nincluding those formed in the laboratory, as well as those usually\r\ncalled minerals; 713 in all.\r\n\r\nFr. Aug. Quenstedt, _Methode der Krystallographie_, 1840, employs a\r\nfanciful method of representing a crystal by projecting upon one\r\nface of the crystal all the other faces. This invention appears to\r\nbe more curious than useful.\r\n\r\nDr. Karl Naumann, who is spoken of in Chap. ix. of this Book, as the\r\nauthor of the best of the Mixed Systems of Classification, published\r\nalso _Grundriss der Krystallographie_, Leipzig, 1826. In this and\r\nother works he modifies the notation of Mohs in a very advantageous\r\nmanner. {628}\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana, in his _System of Mineralogy_, New Haven (U.S.),\r\n1837, follows Naumann for the most part, both in crystallography and\r\nin mineral classification. In the latter part of the subject, he has\r\nmade the attempt, which in all cases is a source of confusion and of\r\nfailure, to introduce a whole system of new names of the members of\r\nhis classification.\r\n\r\nThe geometry of crystallography has been investigated in a very\r\noriginal manner by M. Bravais, in papers published in the Journal of\r\nthe Ecole Polytechnique, entitled _Mémoires sur les Systèmes formés\r\npar des Points_. 1850. _Etudes Crystallographiques_. 1851.\r\n\r\nHermann Kopp (_Einleitung in die Krystallographie_, Braunschweig.\r\n1849) has given the description and measurement of the angles of a\r\nlarge number of laboratory crystals.\r\n\r\nRammelsberg (_Krystallographische Chemie_, Berlin, 1855) has\r\ncollected an account of the systems, simple forms and angles of all\r\nthe laboratory crystals of which he could obtain descriptions.\r\n\r\nSchabus of Vienna (_Bestimmung der Krystallgestalten **in Chemischen\r\nLaboratorien erzeugten Producte_, Wien, 1855; a successful Prize\r\nEssay) has given a description, accompanied by measurements, of 90\r\ncrystalline species from his own observations.\r\n\r\nTo these attempts made in other countries to simplify and improve\r\ncrystallography, I may add a remarkable Essay very recently made\r\nhere by Mr. Brooke, and suggested to him by his exact and familiar\r\nknowledge of Mineralogy. It is to this effect. All the crystalline\r\nforms of any given mineral species are derived from the _primitive\r\nform_ of that species; and the degree of symmetry, and the\r\n_parameters_, of this form determine the angles of all derivative\r\nforms. But how is this primitive form selected and its parameters\r\ndetermined? The selection of the kind of the primitive form depends\r\nupon the _degree of symmetry_ which appears in all the derivative\r\nforms; according to which they belong to the _rhombohedral_,\r\n_prismatic_, _square pyramidal_, or some other _system_: and this\r\ndetermination is commonly clear. But the parameters, or the angles,\r\nof the primitive form, are commonly determined by the _cleavage_ of\r\nthe mineral. Is this a sufficient and necessary ground of such\r\ndetermination? May not a simplification be effected, in some cases,\r\nby taking some other parameters? by taking a primitive form which\r\nbelongs to the proper system, but which has some other angles than\r\nthose given by cleavage? Mr. Brooke has tried whether, for instance,\r\ncrystals of the rhombohedral system may not be referred with\r\nadvantage to primitive rhombohedrons which have, in all {629} the\r\nspecies, nearly the same angles. The advantage to be obtained by\r\nsuch a change would be the simplification of the laws of derivation\r\nin the derivative forms: and therefore we have to ask, whether the\r\nindices of derivation are smaller numbers in this way or with the\r\nhitherto accepted fundamental angles. It appears to me, from the\r\nexamples given, that the advantage of simplicity in the indices is\r\non the side of the old system: but whether this be so or not, it was\r\na great benefit to crystallography to have the two methods compared.\r\nMr. Brooke's Essay is a Memoir presented to the Royal Society in 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Optical Properties of Minerals._\r\n\r\nThe _Handbuch der Optik_, von F. W. G. Radicke, Berlin, 1839,\r\ncontains a chapter on the optical properties of crystals. The\r\nauthor's chief authority is Sir D. Brewster, as might be expected.\r\n\r\nM. Haidinger has devoted much attention to experiments on the\r\n_pleochroism_ of minerals. He has invented an instrument which makes\r\nthe dichroism of minerals more evident by exhibiting the two colors\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\nThe pleochroism of minerals, and especially the remarkable clouds\r\nthat in the cases of Iolite, Andalusite, Augite, Epidote, and\r\nAxinite, border the positions of either optical axis, have been most\r\nsuccessfully imitated by M. de Senarmont by means of artificial\r\ncrystallizations. (_Ann. de Chim._ 3 _Ser._ xli. p. 319.)\r\n\r\nM. Pasteur has found that Racemic Acid consists of two different\r\nacids, having the same density and composition. The salts of these\r\nacids, with bases of Ammonia and of Potassa, are hemihedral, the\r\nhemihedral faces which occur in the one being wanting in the other.\r\nThe acids of these different crystals have circular polarization of\r\nopposite kinds. (_Ann. de Chim._ 3 _Ser._ xxviii. 56, 99.) This\r\ndiscovery was marked by the assignation of the Rumford Medal to M.\r\nPasteur in 1856.\r\n\r\nM. Marbach has discovered that crystals of chlorate of soda, which\r\napparently belongs to the cubic or tessular system, exhibit hemihedral\r\nfaces of a peculiar character; and that the crystals have circular\r\npolarization of opposite kinds in accordance with the differences of\r\nthe plagihedral faces. (_Poggendorf's Annalen_, xci. 482.)\r\n\r\nM. Seybolt of Vienna has found a means of detecting plagihedral\r\nfaces in quartz crystals which do not reveal them externally.\r\n(_Akad. d. Wissenschaft zu Wien_, B. xv. s. 59.) {630}\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Classification of Minerals._\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, B. VIII. C. iii., I\r\nhave treated of the Application of the Natural-history Method of\r\nClassification to Mineralogy, and have spoken of the Systems of this\r\nkind which have been proposed. I have there especially discussed the\r\nsystem proposed in the treatise of M. Necker, _Le Règne Minéral\r\nramené aux Méthodes d'Histoire Naturelle_ (Paris, 1835). More\r\nrecently have been published M. Beudant's _Cours élémentaire\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle, Minéralogie_ (Paris, 1841); and M. A.\r\nDufresnoy's _Traité de Minéralogie_ (Paris, 1845). Both these works\r\nare so far governed by mere chemical views that they lapse into the\r\ninconveniences and defects which are avoided in the best systems of\r\nGerman mineralogists.\r\n\r\nThe last mineral system of Berzelius has been developed by M.\r\nRammelsberg (Nürnberg, 1847). It is in principle such as we have\r\ndescribed it in the history.\r\n\r\nM. **Nordenskiöld's system (3rd Ed. 1849,) has been criticised by G.\r\nRose, who observes that it removes the defects of the system of\r\nBerzelius only in part. He himself proposes what he calls a\r\n\"Krystallo-Chemisches System,\" in which the crystalline form\r\ndetermines the genus and the chemical composition the species. His\r\nclasses are--\r\n1. Simple Substances.\r\n2. Combinations of Sulphur, Selenium, Titanium, Arsenic, Antimony.\r\n3. Chlorides, Fluorides, Bromides, Iodides.\r\n4. Combinations with Oxygen.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that for us, all chemical compounds are\r\n_minerals_, in so far that they are included in our classifications.\r\nThe propriety of this mode of dealing with the subject is confirmed\r\nby our finding that there is really no tenable distinction between\r\nnative minerals and the products of the laboratory. A great number\r\nof eminent chemists have been employed in producing, by artificial\r\nmeans, crystals which had before been known only as native products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{631}}\r\nBOOK XVI.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATORY SCIENCES.\r\n\r\nBOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR the purpose of giving to my reader some indication of the\r\npresent tendency of Botanical Science, I conceive that I cannot do\r\nbetter than direct his attention to the reflections, procedure, and\r\nreasonings which have been suggested by the most recent extensions\r\nof man's knowledge of the vegetable world. And as a specimen of\r\nthese, I may take the labors of Dr. Joseph Hooker, on the Flora of\r\nthe Antarctic Regions,[41\\B] and especially of New Zealand. Dr.\r\nHooker was the Botanist to an expedition commanded by Sir James\r\nRoss, sent out mainly for the purpose of investigating the phenomena\r\nof Terrestrial Magnetism near the South Pole; but directed also to\r\nthe improvement of Natural History. The extension of botanical\r\ndescriptions and classifications to a large mass of new objects\r\nnecessarily suggests wider views of the value of classes (genera,\r\nspecies, &c.,) and the conclusions to be drawn from their constancy\r\nor inconstancy. A few of Dr. Hooker's remarks may show the nature of\r\nthe views taken under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Note 41\\B: _The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H. M. Discovery\r\nShips Erebus and Terror, in the years_ 1839-40. Published 1847.\r\n_Flora Novæ Zelandiæ_. 1853.]\r\n\r\nI may notice, in the first place, (since this work is intended for\r\ngeneral rather than for scientific readers,) Dr. Hooker's testimony\r\nto the value of a technical descriptive language for a\r\nclassificatory science--a Terminology, as it is called. He says, \"It\r\nis impossible to write Botanical descriptions which a person\r\nignorant of Botany can understand, although it is supposed by many\r\nunacquainted with science that this can and should be done.\" And\r\nhence, he says, the state of botanical science demands Latin\r\ndescriptions of the plants; and this is a lesson which he especially\r\nurges upon the Colonists who study the indigenous plants. {632}\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker's remarks on the limits of species, their dispersion and\r\nvariation, are striking and instructive. He is of opinion that\r\nspecies vary more, and are more widely diffused, than is usually\r\nsupposed. Hence he conceives that the number of species has been\r\nneedlessly and erroneously multiplied, by distinguishing the\r\nspecimens which occur in different places, and vary in unessential\r\nfeatures. He says that though, according to the lowest estimate of\r\ncompilers, 100,000 is the commonly received number of known plants,\r\nhe thinks that half that number is much nearer the truth. \"This,\" he\r\nsays, \"may be well conceived, when it is notorious that nineteen\r\nspecies have been made of the Common Potatoe, and many more of\r\n_Solanum nigrum_ alone. _Pteris aquilina_ has given rise to numerous\r\nbook species; _Vernonia cinerea_ of India to fifteen at least. . . .\r\n. . . Many more plants are common to most countries than is\r\nsupposed; I have found 60 New Zealand flowering plants and 9 Ferns\r\nto be European ones, besides inhabiting numerous intermediate\r\ncountries. . . . . . So long ago as 1814, Mr. Brown drew attention\r\nto the importance of such considerations, and gave a list of 150\r\nEuropean plants common to Australia.\"\r\n\r\nAs an example of the extent to which unessential differences may go,\r\nhe says (p. xvii.,) \"The few remaining native Cedars of Lebanon may\r\nbe abnormal states of the tree which was once spread over the whole\r\nof the Lebanon; for there are now growing in England varieties of it\r\nwhich have no existence in a wild state. Some of them closely\r\nresemble the Cedars of Atlas and of the Himalayas (_Deodar_;) and\r\nthe absence of any valid botanical differences tends to prove that\r\nall, though generally supposed to be different species, are one.\"\r\n\r\nStill the great majority of the species of plants in those Southern\r\nregions are peculiar. \"There are upwards of 100 genera, subgenera,\r\nor other well marked groups of plants, entirely or nearly confined\r\nto New Zealand, Australia, and extra-tropical South America. They\r\nare represented by one or more species in two or more of those\r\ncountries, and thus effect a botanical relationship or affinity\r\nbetween them all which every botanist appreciates.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the History of Botany, I have received corrections\r\nand remarks from Dr. Hooker, with which I am allowed to enrich my\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\"P. 359.

Ray was further the author of the present\r\nNatural System in its most comprehensive sense. He first divided\r\nplants into Flowerless and Flowering; and the latter into\r\nMonocotyledonous and Dicotyledonous:--'Floriferas dividemus in\r\nDICOTYLEDONES, quarum semina sata binis foliis, seminalibus dictis,\r\nquæ cotyledonorum usum præstant, e terra exeunt, vel in binos saltem\r\nlobos dividuntur, quamvis eos supra terram foliorum specie non\r\nefferant; et MONOCOTYLEDONES, quæ nec folia bina seminalia efferunt\r\nnec lobos binos condunt. Hæc divisio ad arbores etiam extendi\r\npotest; siquidem Palmæ et congeneres hoc respectu eodem modo a\r\nreliquis arboribus differunt quo Monocotyledones a reliquis herbis.'\r\n\r\n\"P. 408. _Endogenous and Exogenous Growth._ The exact course of the\r\nwood fibres which traverse the stems of both Monocotyledonous and\r\nDicotyledonous plants has been only lately discovered. In the\r\nMonocotyledons, those fibres are collected in bundles, which follow\r\na very peculiar course:--from the base of each leaf they may be\r\nfollowed downwards and inwards, towards the axis of the trunk, when\r\nthey form an arch with the convexity to the centre; and curving\r\noutwards again reach the circumference, where they are lost amongst\r\nthe previously deposited fibres. The intrusion of the bases of these\r\nbundles amongst those already deposited, causes the circumference of\r\nthe stem to be harder than the centre; and as all these arcs have a\r\nshort course (their chords being nearly equal), the trunk does not\r\nincrease in girth, and grows at the apex only. The wood-bundles are\r\nhere definite. In the Dicotyledonous trunks, the layers of wood run\r\nin parallel courses from the base to the top of the trunk, each\r\nexternally to that last formed, and the trunk increases both in\r\nheight and girth; the wood-bundles are here indefinite.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the Cotyledons, though it is often difficult to\r\ndistinguish a Monocotyledonous Embryo from a Dicotyledonous, they\r\nmay always be discriminated when germinating. The Cotyledons, when\r\ntwo or more, and primordial leaves (when no Cotyledons are visible)\r\nof a Monocotyledon, are alternate; those of a Dicotyledon are\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\"A further physiological distinction between Monocotyledons and\r\n{634} Dicotyledons is observed in germination, when the\r\nDicotyledonous radicle elongates and forms the root of the young\r\nplant; the Monocotyledonous radicle does not elongate, but pushes\r\nout rootlets from itself at once. Hence the not very good terms,\r\n_exorhizal_ for Dicotyledonous, and _endorhizal_ for\r\nMonocotyledonous.\r\n\r\n\"The highest physiological generalization in the vegetable kingdom\r\nis between _Phænogama_ and _Cryptogama_. In the former,\r\nfertilization is effected by a pollen-tube touching the nucleus of\r\nan ovule; in Cryptogams, the same process is effected by the contact\r\nof a sperm-cell, usually ciliated (_antherozoid_), upon another kind\r\nof cell called a germ-cell. In Phænogams, further, the organs of\r\nfructification are all modified leaves; those of Cryptogams are not\r\nhomologous.\" (J. D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\nI have exemplified the considerations which govern zoological\r\nclassification by quoting the reflexions which Cuvier gives us, as\r\nhaving led him to his own classification of Fishes. Since the\r\nvarieties of Quadrupeds, or _Mammals_ (omitting whales, &c.), are\r\nmore familiar to the common reader than those of Fishes, I may\r\nnotice some of the steps in their classification; the more so as\r\nsome curious questions have recently arisen thereupon.\r\n\r\nLinnæus first divides Mammals into two groups, as they have Claws,\r\nor Hoofs (_unguiculata_, _ungulata_.) But he then again divides them\r\ninto six orders (omitting whales, &c.), according to their number of\r\n_incisor_, _laniary_, and _molar_ teeth; namely:--\r\n_Primates_. (Man, Monkey, &c.)\r\n_Bruta_. (Rhinoceros, Elephant, &c.)\r\n_Feræ_. (Dog, Cat, Bear, Mole, &c.)\r\n_Glires_. (Mouse, Squirrel, Hare, &c.)\r\n_Pecora_. (Camel, Giraffe, Stag, Goat, Sheep, Ox, &c.)\r\n_Belluæ_. (Horse, Hippopotamus, Tapir, Sow, &c.)\r\n\r\nIn the place of these, Cuvier, as I have stated in the _Philosophy_\r\n(_On the Language of Sciences_, Aphorism xvi.), introduced the\r\nfollowing orders: _Bimanes_, _Quadrumanes_, _Carnassiers_,\r\n_Rongeurs_, _Edentés_, _Pachyderms_, _Ruminans_. Of these, the\r\n_Carnassiers_ correspond to the _Feræ_ of Linnæus; the _Rongeurs_ to\r\nhis _Glires_; the _Edentés_ are a new order, taking the Sloths,\r\nAnt-eaters, &c., from the _Bruta_ of Linnæus, the Megatherium from\r\nextinct animals, and the Ornithorhynchus, &c., from the new animals\r\nof Australia; the _Ruminans_ agree with the {635} _Pecora_; the\r\n_Pachyderms_ include some of the _Bruta_ and the _Belluæ_,\r\ncomprehending also extinct animals, as _Anoplotherium_ and\r\n_Palæotherium_.\r\n\r\nBut the two orders of Hoofed Animals, the Pachyderms and the\r\nRuminants, form a group which is held by Mr. Owen to admit of a\r\nbetter separation, on the ground of a character already pointed out\r\nby Cuvier; namely, as to whether they are _two-toed_ or\r\n_three-toed_. According to this view, the Horse is connected with\r\nthe Tapir, the Palæotherium, and the Rhinoceros, not only by his\r\nteeth, but by his feet, for he has really three digits. And Cuvier\r\nnotices that in the two-toed or even-toed Pachyderms, the astragalus\r\nbone has its face divided into two equal parts by a ridge; while in\r\nthe uneven-toed pachyderms it has a narrow cuboid face. Mr. Owen has\r\nadopted this division of Pachyderms and Ruminants, giving the names\r\n_artiodactyla_ and _perissodactyla_ to the two groups; the former\r\nincluding the Ox, Hog, Peccary, Hippopotamus, &c.; the latter\r\ncomprehending the Horse, Tapir, Rhinoceros, Hyrax, &c. And thus the\r\nRuminants take their place as a subordinate group of the great\r\nnatural even-toed Division of the Hoofed Section of Mammals; and the\r\nHorse is widely separated from them, inasmuch as he belongs to the\r\nodd-toed division.[42\\B]\r\n\r\n[Note 42\\B: Owen, _Odontography_.]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, these modern classifications are so constructed as\r\nto include extinct as well as living species of animals; and indeed\r\nthe species which have been discovered in a fossil state have tended\r\nto fill up the gaps in the series of zoological forms which had\r\nmarred the systems of modern zoologists. This has been the case with\r\nthe division of which we are speaking.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen had established two genera of extinct Herbivorous Animals,\r\non the strength of fossil remains brought from South\r\nAmerica:--_Toxodon_, and _Nesodon_. In a recent communication to the\r\nRoyal Society[43\\B] he has considered the bearing of these genera\r\nupon the divisions of odd-toed and even-toed animals. He had already\r\nbeen led to the opinion that the three sections, _Proboscidea_,\r\n_Perissodactyla_, and _Artiodactyla_, formed a natural division of\r\nUngulata; and he is now led to think that this division implies\r\nanother group, \"a distinct division of the _Ungulata_, of equal\r\nvalue, if not with the _Perissodactyla_ and _Artiodactyla_ at least\r\nwith the _Proboscidea_. This group he proposes to call _Toxodonta_.\r\n\r\n[Note 43\\B: _Phil. Trans._, 1853.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{636}}\r\nBOOK XVII.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE MORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morphology in Linnæus._\r\n\r\nI HAVE stated that Linnæus had some views on this subject. Dr.\r\nHooker conceives these views to be more complete and correct than is\r\ngenerally allowed, though unhappily clothed in metaphorical language\r\nand mixed with speculative matter. By his permission I insert some\r\nremarks which I have received from him.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental passage on this subject is in the _Systema Naturæ_;\r\nin the Introduction to which work the following passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n\"Prolepsis (Anticipation) exhibits the mystery of the metamorphosis\r\nof plants, by which the herb, which is the _larva_ or imperfect\r\ncondition, is changed into the declared fructification: for the\r\nplant is capable of producing either a leafy herb or a\r\nfructification. . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"When a tree produces a flower, nature anticipates the produce of\r\nfive years where these come out all at once; forming of the\r\nbud-leaves of the next year _bracts_; of those of the following\r\nyear, the _calyx_; of the following, the _corolla_; of the next, the\r\n_stamina_; of the subsequent, the _pistils_, filled with the\r\ngranulated marrow of the seed, the terminus of the life of a\r\nvegetable.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker says, \"I derive my idea of his having a better knowledge\r\nof the subject than most Botanists admit, not only from the\r\nProlepsis, but from his paper called _Reformatio Botanices_ (_Amœn.\r\nAcad._ vol. vi.); a remarkable work, in respect of his candor in\r\nspeaking of his predecessors' labors, and the sagacity he shows in\r\nindicating researches to be undertaken or completed. Amongst the\r\nlatter is V. 'Prolepsis plantarum, ulterius extendenda per earum\r\nmetamorphoses.' The last word occurs rarely in his _Prolepsis_; but\r\nwhen it does it seems to me that he uses it as indicating a normal\r\nchange and not an accidental one. {637}\r\n\r\n\"In the _Prolepsis_ the speculative matter, which Linnæus himself\r\ncarefully distinguishes as such, must be separated from the rest,\r\nand this may I think be done in most of the sections. He starts with\r\nexplaining clearly and well the origin and position of buds, and\r\ntheir constant presence, whether developed or not, in the axil of\r\nthe leaf: adding abundance of acute observations and experiments to\r\nprove his statements. The leaf he declares to be the first effort of\r\nthe plant in spring: he proceeds to show, successively, that bracts,\r\ncalyx, corolla, stamens, and pistil are each of them metamorphosed\r\nleaves, in every case giving MANY EXAMPLES, both from monsters and\r\nfrom characters presented by those organs in their normal condition.\r\n\r\n\"The (to me) obscure and critical part of the _Prolepsis_ was that\r\nrelating to the change of the style of _Carduus_ into two leaves. Mr.\r\nBrown has explained this. He says it was a puzzle to him, till he went\r\nto Upsala and consulted Fries and Wahlenberg, who informed him that\r\nsuch monstrous _Cardui_ grew in the neighborhood, and procured him\r\nsome. Considering how minute and masked the organs of _Compositæ_ are,\r\nit shows no little skill in Linnæus, and a very clear view of the\r\nwhole matter, to have traced the metamorphosis of all their floral\r\norgans into leaves, except their stamens, of which he says, 'Sexti\r\nanni folia e staminibus me non in compositis vidisse fateor, sed\r\nillorum loco folia pistillacea, quæ in compositis aut plenis sunt\r\nfrequentissima.' I must say that nothing could well be clearer to my\r\nmind than the full and accurate appreciation which Linnæus shows of\r\nthe whole series of phenomena, and their _rationale_. He over and over\r\nagain asserts that these organs are leaves, every one of them,--I do\r\nnot understand him to say that the prolepsis is an accidental change\r\nof leaves into bracts, of bracts into calyx, and so forth. Even were\r\nthe language more obscure, much might be inferred from the wide range\r\nand accuracy of the observations he details so scientifically. It is\r\ninconceivable that a man should have traced the sequence of the\r\nphenomena under so many varied aspects, and shown such skill,\r\nknowledge, ingenuity, and accuracy in his methods of observing and\r\ndescribing, and yet missed the _rationale_ of the whole. Eliminate the\r\nspeculative parts and there is not a single error of observation or\r\njudgment; whilst his history of the developement of buds, leaves, and\r\nfloral organs, and of various other obscure matters of equal interest\r\nand importance, are of a very high order of merit, are, in fact, for\r\nthe time profound.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in all this that detracts from the merit of\r\nGoethe's {638} re-discovery. With Goethe it was, I think, a\r\ndeductive process,--with Linnæus an inductive. Analyse Linnæus's\r\nobservations and method, and I think it will prove a good example of\r\ninductive reasoning.\r\n\r\n\"P. 473. Perhaps Professor Auguste St Hilaire of Montpellier should\r\nshare with De Candolle the honor of contributing largely to\r\nestablish the metamorphic doctrine;--their labors were\r\ncotemporaneous.\r\n\r\n\"P. **474. Linnæus pointed out that the pappus was calyx: 'Et\r\n_pappum_ gigni ex quarti anni foliis, in jam nominatis\r\nCarduis.'--_Prol. Plant._ 338.\" (_J. D. H._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nANIMAL MORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE subject of Animal Morphology has recently been expanded into a\r\nform strikingly comprehensive and systematic by Mr. Owen; and\r\nsupplied by him with a copious and carefully-chosen language; which\r\nin his hands facilitates vastly the comparison and appreciation of\r\nthe previous labors of physiologists, and opens the way to new\r\ntruths and philosophical generalizations. Though the steps which\r\nhave been made had been prepared by previous anatomists, I will\r\nborrow my view of them mainly from him; with the less scruple,\r\ninasmuch as he has brought into full view the labors of his\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nI have stated in the History that the skeletons of all vertebrate\r\nanimals are conceived to be reducible to a single Type, and the\r\nskull reducible to a series of vertebræ. But inasmuch as this\r\nreduction includes not only a detailed correspondence of the bones\r\nof man with those of beasts, but also with those of birds, fishes,\r\nand reptiles, it may easily be conceived that the similarities and\r\nconnexions are of a various and often remote kind. The views of such\r\nrelations, held by previous Comparative Anatomists, have led to the\r\ndesignations of the bones of animals which have been employed in\r\nanatomical descriptions; and these designations having been framed\r\nand adopted by anatomists looking at the subject from different\r\nsides, and having different views of analogies and relations, have\r\nbeen very various and unstable; besides being often of cumbrous\r\nlength and inconvenient form.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding parts in different animals are called _homologues_,\r\n{639} a term first applied to anatomy by the philosophers of Germany;\r\nand this term Mr. Owen adopts, to the exclusion of terms more loosely\r\ndenoting identity or similarity. And the Homology of the various bones\r\nof vertebrates having been in a great degree determined by the labors\r\nof previous anatomists, Mr. Owen has proposed names for each of the\r\nbones: the condition of such names being, that the homologues in all\r\nvertebrates shall be called by the same name, and that these names\r\nshall be founded upon the terms and phrases in which the great\r\nanatomists of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries expressed the results\r\nof their researches respecting the human skeleton. These names, thus\r\nselected, so far as concerned the bones of the Head of Fishes, one of\r\nthe most difficult cases of this Special Homology, he published in a\r\nTable,[44\\B] in which they were compared, in parallel columns, with\r\nthe names or phrases used for the like purpose by Cuvier, Agassiz,\r\nGeoffroy, Hallman, Sœmmering, Meckel, and Wagner. As an example of the\r\nconsiderations by which this selection of names was determined, I may\r\nquote what he says with regard to one of these bones of the skull.\r\n\r\n[Note 44\\B: _Lectures on Vertebrates_. 1846, p. 158. And _On the\r\nArchetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton_. 1848, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the 'squamosal' (_squamosum_. Lat. pars squamosa\r\nossis temporis.--Sœmmering), it might be asked why the term\r\n'temporal' might not be retained for this bone. I reply, because\r\nthat term has long been, and is now universally, understood in human\r\nanatomy to signify a peculiarly anthropotomical coalesced congeries\r\nof bones, which includes the 'squamosal' together with the\r\n'petrosal,' the 'tympanic,' the 'mastoid,' and the 'stylohyal.' It\r\nseems preferable, therefore, to restrict the signification of the\r\nterm 'temporal' to the whole (in Man) of which the 'squamosal' is a\r\npart. To this part Cuvier has unfortunately applied the term\r\n'temporal' in one class, and 'jugal' in another; and he has also\r\ntransferred the term 'temporal' to a third equally distinct bone in\r\nfishes; while to increase the confusion M. Agassiz has shifted the\r\nname to a fourth different bone in the skull of fishes. Whatever,\r\ntherefore, may be the value assigned to the arguments which will be\r\npresently set forth, as to the special homologies of the 'pars\r\nsquamosa ossis temporis,' I have felt compelled to express the\r\nconclusion by a definite term, and in the present instance, have\r\nselected that which recalls the best accepted anthropomorphical\r\ndesignation of the part; although 'squamosal' must be understood and\r\napplied in an arbitrary sense; and not as descriptive of a\r\nscale-like {640} form; which in reference to the bone so called, is\r\nrather its exceptional than normal figure in the vertebrate series.\"\r\n\r\nThe principles which Mr. Owen here adopts in the selection of names\r\nfor the parts of the skeleton are wise and temperate. They agree\r\nwith the aphorisms concerning the language of science which I\r\npublished in the _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_; and Mr.\r\nOwen does me the great honor of quoting with approval some of those\r\nAphorisms. I may perhaps take the liberty of remarking that the\r\nsystem of terms which he has constructed, may, according to our\r\nprinciples, be called rather a _Terminology_ **than a\r\n_Nomenclature_: that is, they are analogous more nearly to the\r\n_terms_ by which botanists describe the parts and organs of plants,\r\nthan to the _names_ by which they denote genera and species. As we\r\nhave seen in the History, plants as well as animals are subject to\r\nmorphological laws; and the names which are given to organs in\r\nconsequence of those laws are a part of the Terminology of the\r\nscience. Nor is this distinction between Terminology and\r\nNomenclature without its use; for the rules of prudence and\r\npropriety in the selection of words in the two cases are different.\r\nThe Nomenclature of genera and species may be arbitrary and casual,\r\nas is the case to a great extent in Botany and in Zoology,\r\nespecially of fossil remains; names being given, for instance,\r\nsimply as marks of honor to individuals. But in a Terminology, such\r\na mode of derivation is not admissible: some significant analogy or\r\nidea must be adopted, at least as the origin of the name, though not\r\nnecessarily true in all its applications, as we have seen in the\r\ncase of the \"squamosal\" just quoted. This difference in the rules\r\nrespecting two classes of scientific words is stated in the\r\n_Aphorisms_ xiii. and xiv. _concerning the Language of Science_.\r\n\r\nSuch a Terminology of the bones of the skeletons of all vertebrates\r\nas Mr. Owen has thus propounded, cannot be otherwise than an immense\r\nacquisition to science, and a means of ascending from what we know\r\nalready to wider truths and new morphological doctrines.\r\n\r\nWith regard to one of these doctrines, the resolution of the human\r\nhead into vertebræ, Mr. Owen now regards it as a great truth, and\r\nreplies to the objections of Cuvier and M. Agassiz, in detail.[45\\B]\r\nHe gives a Table in which the Bones of the Head are resolved into\r\nfour vertebræ, which he terms the Occipital, Parietal, Frontal, and\r\nNasal Vertebra, respectively. These four vertebræ agree in general\r\nwith what Oken called the Ear-vertebra, the Jaw-vertebra, the\r\nEye-vertebra, and {641} the Nose-vertebra, in his work _On the\r\nSignification of the Bones of the Skull_, published in 1807: and in\r\nvarious degrees, with similar views promulgated by Spix (1815),\r\nBojanus (1818), Geoffroy (1824), Carus **(1828). And I believe that\r\nthese views, bold and fanciful as they at first appeared, have now\r\nbeen accepted by most of the principal physiologists of our time.\r\n\r\n[Note 45\\B: _Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton_.\r\n1848, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nBut another aspect of this generalization has been propounded among\r\nphysiologists; and has, like the others, been extended,\r\nsystematized, and provided with a convenient language by Mr. Owen.\r\nSince animal skeletons are thus made up of vertebræ and their parts\r\nare to be understood as developements of the parts of vertebræ,\r\nGeoffroy (1822), Carus (1828), Müller (1834), Cuvier (1836), had\r\nemployed certain terms while speaking of such developements; Mr.\r\nOwen in the _Geological Transactions_ in 1838, while discussing the\r\nosteology of certain fossil Saurians, used terms of this kind, which\r\nare more systematic than those of his predecessors, and to which he\r\nhas given currency by the quantity of valuable knowledge and thought\r\nwhich he has embodied in them.\r\n\r\nAccording to his Terminology,[46\\B] a vertebra, in its typical\r\ncompleteness, consists of a central part or _centrum_; at the back\r\nof this, two plates (the _neural apophyses_) and a third outward\r\nprojecting piece (the _neural spine_), which three, with the\r\ncentrum, form a canal for the spinal marrow; at the front of the\r\ncentrum two other plates (the _hæmal apophyses_) and a projecting\r\npiece, forming a canal for a vascular trunk. Further lateral\r\nelements (_pleuro-apophyses_) and other projections, are in a\r\ncertain sense dependent on these principal bones; besides which the\r\nvertebra may support _diverging appendages_. These parts of the\r\nvertebra are fixed together, so that a vertebra is by some\r\nanatomists described as a single bone; but the parts now mentioned\r\nare usually developed from distinct and independent centres, and are\r\ntherefore called by Mr. Owen \"autogenous\" elements.\r\n\r\n[Note 46\\B: _Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton_.\r\n1848, p. 81.]\r\n\r\nThe _General_ Homology of the vertebral skeleton is the reference of\r\nall the parts of a skeleton to their true types in a series of\r\nvertebræ: and thus, as _special_ homology refers all the parts of\r\nskeletons to a given type of skeleton, say that of Man, _general_\r\nhomology refers all the parts of every skeleton, say that of Man, to\r\nthe parts of a series of Vertebræ. And thus as Oken propounded his\r\nviews of the Head as a resolution of the Problem of _the\r\nSignification of the Bones of the Head_, {642} so have we in like\r\nmanner, for the purposes of General Homology, to solve the Problem\r\nof _the Signification of Limbs_. The whole of the animal being a\r\nstring of vertebræ, what are arms and legs, hands and paws, claws\r\nand fingers, wings and fins, and the like? This inquiry Mr. Owen has\r\npursued as a necessary part of his inquiries. In giving a public\r\nlecture upon the subject in 1849,[47\\B] he conceived that the phrase\r\nwhich I have just employed would not be clearly apprehended by an\r\nEnglish Audience, and entitled his Discourse \"On the _Nature_ of\r\nLimbs:\" and in this discourse he explained the modifications by\r\nwhich the various kinds of limbs are derived from their rudiments in\r\nan archetypal skeleton, that is, a mere series of vertebræ without\r\nhead, arms, legs, wings, or fins.\r\n\r\n[Note 47\\B: _On the Nature of Limbs_, a discourse delivered at a\r\nMeeting of the Royal Institution, 1849.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Final Causes_\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in the History that in the discussions which\r\ntook place concerning the Unity of Plan of animal structure, this\r\nprinciple was in some measure put in opposition to the principle of\r\nFinal Causes: Morphology was opposed to Teleology. It is natural to\r\nask whether the recent study of Morphology has affected this\r\nantithesis.\r\n\r\nIf there be advocates of Final Causes in Physiology who would push\r\ntheir doctrines so far as to assert that every feature and every\r\nrelation in the structure of animals have a purpose discoverable by\r\nman, such reasoners are liable to be perpetually thwarted and\r\nembarrassed by the progress of anatomical knowledge; for this\r\nprogress often shows that an arrangement which had been explained\r\nand admired with reference to some purpose, exists also in cases\r\nwhere the purpose disappears; and again, that what had been noted as\r\na special teleological arrangement is the result of a general\r\nmorphological law. Thus to take an example given by Mr. Owen: that\r\nthe ossification of the head originates in several centres, and thus\r\nin its early stages admits of compression, has been pointed out as a\r\nprovision to facilitate the birth of viviparous animals; but our\r\nview of this provision is disturbed, when we find that the same mode\r\nof the formation of the bony framework takes place in animals which\r\nare born from an egg. And the number of points from which\r\nossification begins, depends in a wider sense on the general\r\nhomology of the animal frame, according to which each part is\r\ncomposed of a certain number of autogenous vertebral elements. In\r\nthis {643} way, the admission of a new view as to Unity of Plan will\r\nalmost necessarily displace or modify some of the old views\r\nrespecting Final Causes.\r\n\r\nBut though the view of Final Causes is displaced, it is not\r\nobliterated; and especially if the advocate of Purpose is also ready\r\nto admit visible correspondences which have not a discoverable\r\nobject, as well as contrivances which have. And in truth, how is it\r\npossible for the student of anatomy to shut his eyes to either of\r\nthese two evident aspects of nature? The arm and hand of man are\r\nmade for taking and holding, the wing of the sparrow is made for\r\nflying; and each is adapted to its end with subtle and manifest\r\ncontrivance. There is plainly Design. But the arm of man and the\r\nwing of the sparrow correspond to each other in the most exact\r\nmanner, bone for bone. Where is the Use or the Purpose of this\r\ncorrespondence? If it be said that there may be a purpose though we\r\ndo not see it, that is granted. But Final Causes _for us_ are\r\ncontrivances of which _we see_ the end; and nothing is added to the\r\nevidence of Design by the perception of a unity of plan which in no\r\nway tends to promote the design.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the design appears in the modification of the\r\nplan in special ways for special purposes;--that the vertebral plan\r\nof an animal being given, the fore limbs are modified in Man and in\r\nSparrow, as the nature and life of each require. And this is truly\r\nsaid; and is indeed the truth which we are endeavoring to bring into\r\nview:--that there are in such speculations, two elements; one given,\r\nthe other to be worked out from our examination of the case; the\r\n_datum_ and the _problem_; the homology and the teleology.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen, who has done so much for the former of these portions of\r\nour knowledge, has also been constantly at the same time\r\ncontributing to the other. While he has been aiding our advances\r\ntowards the Unity of Nature, he has been ever alive to the\r\nperception of an Intelligence which pervades Nature. While his\r\nmorphological doctrines have moved the point of view from which he\r\nsees Design, they have never obscured his view of it, but, on the\r\ncontrary, have led him to present it to his readers in new and\r\nstriking aspects. Thus he has pointed out the final purposes in the\r\ndifferent centres of ossification of the long bones of the limbs of\r\nmammals, and shown how and why they differ in this respect from\r\nreptiles (_Archetype_, p. 104). And in this way he has been able to\r\npoint out the insufficiency of the rule laid down both by Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire and Cuvier, for ascertaining the true number of bones in\r\neach species. {644}\r\n\r\nFinal Causes, or Evidences of Design, appear, as we have said, not\r\nmerely as contrivances for evident purposes, but as modifications of\r\na given general Plan for special given ends. If the general Plan be\r\ndiscovered after the contrivance has been noticed, the discovery may\r\nat first seem to obscure our perception of Purpose; but it will soon\r\nbe found that it merely transfers us to a higher point of view. The\r\nadaptation of the Means to the End remains, though the Means are\r\nparts of a more general scheme than we were aware of. No\r\ngeneralization of the Means can or ought permanently to shake our\r\nconviction of the End; because we must needs suppose that the\r\nIntelligence which contemplates the End is an intelligence which can\r\nsee at a glance along a vista of Means, however long and complex.\r\nAnd on the other hand, no special contrivance, however clear be its\r\narrangement, can be unconnected with the general correspondences and\r\nharmonies by which all parts of nature are pervaded and bound\r\ntogether. And thus no luminous teleological point can be\r\nextinguished by homology; nor, on the other hand, can it be detached\r\nfrom the general expanse of homological light.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Final Causes is sometimes spoken of as\r\nunphilosophical, in consequence of Francis Bacon's comparison of\r\nFinal Causes in Physics to Vestal Virgins devoted to God, and\r\nbarren. I have repeatedly shown that, in Physiology, almost all the\r\ngreat discoveries which have been made, have been made by the\r\nassumption of a purpose in animal structures. With reference to\r\nBacon's simile, I have elsewhere said that if he had had occasion to\r\ndevelope its bearings, full of latent meaning as his similes so\r\noften are, he would probably have said that to those Final Causes\r\nbarrenness was no reproach, seeing they ought to be not the Mothers\r\nbut the Daughters of our Natural Sciences; and that they were\r\nbarren, not by imperfection of their nature, but in order that they\r\nmight be kept pure and undefiled, and so fit ministers in the temple\r\nof God. I might add that in Physiology, if they are not Mothers,\r\nthey are admirable Nurses; skilful and sagacious in perceiving the\r\nsigns of pregnancy, and helpful in bringing the Infant Truth into\r\nthe light of day.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect of the doctrine of the Archetypal Unity of\r\nComposition of Animals, by which it points to an Intelligence from\r\nwhich the frame of nature proceeds; namely this:--that the Archetype\r\nof the Animal Structure being of the nature of an _Idea_, implies a\r\nmind in which this Idea existed; and that thus Homology itself\r\npoints the way to the Divine Mind. But while we acknowledge the full\r\n{645} value of this view of theological bearing of physiology, we\r\nmay venture to say that it is a view quite different from that which\r\nis described by speaking of \"Final Causes,\" and one much more\r\ndifficult to present in a lucid manner to ordinary minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{646}}\r\nBOOK XVIII.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH regard to Geology, as a Palætiological Science, I do not know\r\nthat any new light of an important kind has been thrown upon the\r\ngeneral doctrines of the science. Surveys and examinations of\r\nspecial phenomena and special districts have been carried on with\r\nactivity and intelligence; and the animals of which the remains\r\npeople the strata, have been reconstructed by the skill and\r\nknowledge of zoologists:--of such reconstructions we have, for\r\ninstance, a fine assemblage in the publications of the\r\nPalæontological Society. But the great questions of the manner of\r\nthe creation and succession of animal and vegetable species upon the\r\nearth remain, I think, at the point at which they were when I\r\npublished the last edition of the History.\r\n\r\nI may notice the views propounded by some chemists of certain\r\nbearings of Mineralogy upon Geology. As we have, in mineral masses,\r\norganic remains of former organized beings, so have we crystalline\r\nremains of former crystals; namely, what are commonly called\r\n_pseudomorphoses_--the shape of one crystal in the substance of\r\nanother. M. G. Bischoff[48\\B] considers the study of pseudomorphs as\r\nimportant in geology, and as frequently the only means of tracing\r\nprocesses which have taken place and are still going on in the\r\nmineral kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Note 48\\B: _Chemical and Physical Geology_.]\r\n\r\nI may notice also Professor Breithaupt's researches on the order of\r\nsuccession of different minerals, by observing the mode in which\r\nthey occur and the order in which different crystals have been\r\ndeposited, promise to be of great use in following out the\r\ngeological changes which the crust of the globe has undergone. (_Die\r\nParagenesis der Mineralien_. Freiberg. 1849.)\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with these may be taken M. de Senarmont's experiments\r\non the formation of minerals in veins; and besides Bischoff's {647}\r\n_Chemical Geology_, Sartorius von Walterhausen's Observations on the\r\noccurrence of minerals in Amygdaloid.\r\n\r\nAs a recent example of speculations concerning Botanical\r\nPalætiology, I may give Dr. Hooker's views of the probable history\r\nof the Flora of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn speculating upon this question, Dr. Hooker is led to the\r\ndiscussion of geological doctrines concerning the former continuity\r\nof tracts of land which are now separate, the elevation of low lands\r\ninto mountain ranges in the course of ages, and the like. We have\r\nalready seen, in the speculations of the late lamented Edward\r\nForbes, (see Book xviii. chap. vi. of this History,) an example of a\r\nhypothesis propounded to account for the existing Flora of England:\r\na hypothesis, namely, of a former Connexion of the West of the\r\nBritish Isles with Portugal, of the Alps of Scotland with those of\r\nScandinavia, and of the plains of East Anglia with those of Holland.\r\nIn like manner Dr. Hooker says (p. xxi.) that he was led to\r\nspeculate on the possibility of the plants of the Southern Ocean\r\nbeing the remains of a Flora that had once spread over a larger and\r\nmore continuous tract of land than now exists in the ocean; and that\r\nthe peculiar Antarctic genera and species may be the vestiges of a\r\nFlora characterized by the predominance of plants which are now\r\nscattered throughout the Southern islands. He conceives this\r\nhypothesis to be greatly supported by the observations and\r\nreasonings of Mr. Darwin, tending to show that such risings and\r\nsinkings are in active progress over large portions of the\r\ncontinents and islands of the Southern hemisphere: and by the\r\nspeculations of Sir C. Lyell respecting the influence of climate on\r\nthe migrations of plants and animals, and the influence of\r\ngeological changes upon climate.\r\n\r\nIn Zoology I may notice (following Mr. Owen)[49\\B] recent\r\ndiscoveries of the remains of the animals which come nearest to man\r\nin their structure. At the time of Cuvier's death, in 1832, no\r\nevidence had been obtained of fossil Quadrumana; and he supposed\r\nthat these, as well as Bimana, were of very recent introduction.\r\nSoon after, in the oldest (eocene) tertiary deposits of Suffolk,\r\nremains were found proving the existence of a monkey of the genus\r\nMacacus. In the Himalayan tertiaries were found petrified bones of a\r\nSemnopithecus; in Brazil, remains of an extinct platyrhine monkey of\r\ngreat size; and lastly, in the middle tertiary series of the South\r\nof France, was discovered a fragment of the jaw of the long-armed\r\nape (_Hylobates_). But no fossil human {648} remains have been\r\ndiscovered in the regularly deposited layers of any divisions (not\r\neven the pleiocene) of the tertiary series; and thus we have evidence\r\nthat the placing of man on the earth was the last and peculiar act\r\nof Creation.\r\n\r\n[Note 49\\B: _Brit.

A second edition appeared in 1847, and a third in 1857. A\r\n2-volume version of the 3rd edition was published in New York in 1858,\r\nreprinted 1875. This Project Gutenberg text, combining both volumes\r\nin sequence, was derived from the 1875 version, relying upon resources\r\nkindly provided by the Internet Archive.\r\n\r\nThree items have been added to the Contents of the First Volume;\r\nthey are marked off by ~ ~, as are any other additions to the text.\r\n\r\nPrinted page numbers have been transcribed in { }; pages without a\r\nprinted number have been indicated by {{ }}. Where words were\r\nhyphenated across pages, the number has been placed before the word.\r\n\r\nFractions have been transcribed as numerator/denominator, occasionally\r\nusing parentheses to disambiguate. The original sometimes has\r\nnumerator over a line with denominator below, at other times numerator\r\nhyphen denominator. Superscripted characters are marked by a ^ before\r\nthe character.\r\n\r\nFootnotes in the original text were numbered by chapter; here they\r\nhave been numbered by Book (the number of which is given after a \\,\r\nfor the two appendices to the 3rd edition A has been used for volume\r\n1, B for volume 2). They are placed after the paragraph in which\r\nthey occur, and are transcribed [Note m\\n: ...]. Footnote anchors\r\nare transcribed [m\\n]. All other square brackets are in the original\r\ntext.\r\n\r\nOne difficult item is the use of numbers within a ring as names of\r\nasteroids; here the numbers are in ( ).\r\n\r\nCorrections to the text have been marked with **. They are listed\r\nbelow, and were usually confirmed by reference to English printings\r\nof the text. Inconsistencies, especially with respect to accents and\r\nformatting, are numerous and have in general not been adjusted, though\r\nGreek quotations have been checked against other versions where\r\navailable.
