THE EARL OF DURHAM, K.G.,\r\n          _Lord-Lieutenant of the County Palatine of Durham_,\r\n\r\n                      THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED BY\r\n\r\n                          HIS KIND PERMISSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palatinate of Durham possesses special claims to the attention of\r\nstudents of history. It alone amongst the English counties was for\r\ncenturies ruled by Sovereign Bishops possessing their own peers, troops,\r\nmint, and legal courts. In every respect it was a miniature kingdom, in\r\nits constitution like only to the well-known Prince-Bishoprics of the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nIn the past the county has been favoured by a succession of historians,\r\nwho have dealt more or less fully with its parochial history. More\r\nrecently Dr. Lapsley and the contributors to the \"Victoria History\" have\r\nminutely examined the various phases of its early constitution. In the\r\npublications of the local archæological societies, the greater mansions\r\nand most of the more interesting churches have been dealt with in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nIn view, therefore, of the now considerable accumulated literature upon\r\nthe county, it has been a matter of no small difficulty to select\r\nsubjects which should be helpful to the scholar as well as interesting\r\nto the general reader.\r\n\r\nIt has been endeavoured to make this volume serve a twofold purpose.\r\nFirstly, to awaken a greater interest in the past of this most historic\r\ndistrict, and secondly, to serve as an introduction to the greater\r\nhistories of the county. Some day, perhaps, we may hope to see an\r\nedition of Surtees’, revised to a recent date, and covering those\r\nportions of the county which he did not live to deal with.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the Earl of Durham we are enabled to reproduce\r\nfor the first time the portrait of William James, sometime Bishop of\r\nDurham. Lord Strathmore has kindly enabled us to include the very\r\ninteresting photograph of Streatlam Castle. Thanks are also due to Mrs.\r\nGreenwell, of Greenwell Ford, for the photograph of Fen Hall. Mr. J.\r\nTavenor-Perry has supplied the sketches of the cathedral sanctuary\r\nknocker and the dun cow panel, besides the valuable measured drawings of\r\nFinchale Priory. The remaining sketches in pen and ink have been\r\ncontributed by Mr. Wilfrid Leighton.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in addition to thanking the contributors of the various\r\nchapters for the care with which they have treated their subjects,\r\nthanks are due to the Rev. William Greenwell and to the Rev. Dr. Gee,\r\nwho have both made useful suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\nHistorical Introduction                By the Rev.

HENRY GEE, D.D., F.S.A., MASTER OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE,\r\nDURHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older maps of England, that portion of the country which we call\r\nthe county of Durham is generally described as \"Episcopatus\r\nDunelmensis,\" or the Bishopric of Durham, or simply the Bishopric. A\r\nfurther glance at the adjacent districts of Northumberland and Yorkshire\r\nshows that there are portions larger or smaller of those counties which\r\nare marked as integral parts of Durham. These members of the Bishopric\r\nare Norhamshire, Islandshire, and Bedlingtonshire in Northumberland,\r\nwith the Manors of Northallerton, Howden, and Crayke, and certain lands\r\nadjacent to them in Yorkshire. These portions of the Bishopric were only\r\ncut off from it and merged in their own surrounding counties within the\r\nmemory of persons still living. Indeed, the distinction between\r\nBishopric folk and County folk--that is to say, people of Durham and\r\npeople of Northumberland--is not yet quite forgotten, and looks back to\r\na very interesting piece of English history that has to do with a state\r\nof things in the North of England which has now passed away.\r\n\r\nVisitors who come to the city of Durham to-day and look on cathedral and\r\ncastle have some vague idea of a time when the Bishop of Durham had \"the\r\npower of life and death,\" as it is popularly called; but what this\r\nmeans, and what the peculiar constitution of the neighbourhood was, they\r\ndo not, as a rule, understand. It may be worth while to try and get a\r\nclearer view of the Bishopric of Durham, and more especially of the\r\nmain portion between Tyne and Tees, which forms the modern county. We\r\nto-day are so much accustomed to a strong central Government controlling\r\nthe whole of England, that we find it hard to think of a time when\r\ncertain districts had a large independence, and were ruled by a local\r\nEarl or by Bishop, rather than by the King in the capital. Yet there\r\nwere such times both in England and upon the Continent. The district so\r\nruled is known as a franchise or liberty, and the history of its\r\nindependence, won, maintained, or lost, generally forms an attractive\r\nsubject of study, with many exciting episodes in it. The assertion is\r\ncertainly true of Durham; and although it is not possible to go into\r\ndetail within the space of an introductory article like this, it may be\r\npossible to explain what the Bishopric was, and how it came to get its\r\ndistinctive characteristics and its later modification.\r\n\r\nThe franchise of the Bishop of Durham may be most aptly understood if we\r\ntry to regard all the members of it mentioned above as a little kingdom,\r\nof which Durham City was the capital. The Bishop of Durham was virtually\r\nthe King of this little realm, and ruled it, not only as its spiritual\r\nhead, but as its temporal head. As its spiritual head, he was in the\r\nposition of any ordinary Bishop, and possessed exactly the same powers\r\nas other prelates. As its temporal head, he had a power which they\r\ngenerally did not possess. Dr. Freeman has explained his position in the\r\nfollowing words: \"The prelate of Durham became one and the more\r\nimportant of the only two English prelates whose worldly franchises\r\ninvested them with some faint shadow of the sovereign powers enjoyed by\r\nthe princely Churchmen of the Empire. The Bishop of Ely in his island,\r\nthe Bishop of Durham in his hill-fortress, possessed powers which no\r\nother English ecclesiastic was allowed to share.... The external aspect\r\nof the city of itself suggests its peculiar character. Durham alone\r\namong English cities, with its highest point crowned, not only by the\r\ncathedral, but by the vast castle of the Prince-Bishop, recalls to mind\r\nthose cities of the Empire--Lausanne, or Chur, or Sitten--where the\r\npriest, who bore alike the sword and the pastoral staff, looked down\r\nfrom his fortified height on a flock which he had to guard no less\r\nagainst worldly than against ghostly foes.\"[1] And this sovereignty was\r\nno nominal thing, for the Bishop came to have most of the institutions\r\nthat we connect with the thought of a kingdom. He had his own courts of\r\nlaw, his own officers of state, his own assemblies, his own system of\r\nfinance, his own coinage, and, to some extent, he had his own troops and\r\nhis own ships. As we understand all this, we shall appreciate the\r\nsignificance of the lofty throne erected by Bishop Hatfield in Durham\r\nCathedral. It was placed there in the flourishing days of the Bishop’s\r\npower, and is not merely the seat of a Bishop, but the throne of a King.\r\nSo too, hard by, in the Bishop’s castle, as the chronicler tells us,\r\nthere were two seats of royalty within the hall, one at either end. No\r\ndoubt it was before the Bishop, sitting as Prince in one of these, that\r\nthe great tenants of his franchise--the Barons of the Bishopric, as they\r\nwere actually called--did homage in respect of their lands. Perhaps,\r\nwhen he sat in the other from time to time as Bishop, his clergy and\r\nothers recognized his spiritual authority, or submitted themselves to\r\nhis \"godly admonitions.\"\r\n\r\nThe county of Durham has been marked out by nature, more or less\r\ndistinctly, as separate from the neighbouring counties. The Tees on the\r\nsouth, and the Tyne on the north, with the Derwent running from the\r\nwestern fells to the Tyne, sufficiently differentiate it. In what\r\nfollows we will keep mainly to the district represented by the modern\r\ncounty, leaving out of view the members outside to which reference has\r\nbeen made. Its history, until modern times, is largely ecclesiastical,\r\nowing to its peculiar constitution, in which the Bishop plays so\r\nimportant a part. It had, indeed, virtually no history until the Church\r\nbecame the great civilizer in Northumbria. Its prehistoric remains are\r\nfew, if interesting. Its occupation by Brigantes, a Celtic tribe, is a\r\nlarge fact with no details. In the days when Romans made the North of\r\nBritain their own, there is still no history beyond the evidence of\r\nRoman roads, with camps at Binchester, Lanchester, and Ebchester.\r\nCertainly no Roman Christian remains have been found as yet; but when in\r\nthe seventh century Christianity came to the Anglian invaders who\r\nsettled in these parts after the departure of the Romans, the history of\r\nthe English people was born within the confines of the modern county.\r\nBede, the first of English scholars and writers, compiled his history in\r\nthe monastery of Jarrow. He tells us all we know of the earliest Durham\r\nChristians--of Benedict Biscop and of Hilda, who, with himself, are the\r\nfirst three historic personages in the district. In one pregnant\r\nsentence he tells us how churches were built in different places, how\r\nthe people flocked together to hear the Word, and how landed possessions\r\nwere given by royal munificence to found monasteries. These monasteries\r\nbecame the centres of religion, civilization, and learning all over\r\nNorthumbria; and, in particular, the monasteries of Jarrow and\r\nWearmouth, twin foundations of Benedict Biscop, were the commencement of\r\neverything best worth having between Tyne and Tees.\r\n\r\nThus religion, art, and literature, were born in Durham. In the last\r\nyears of the eighth century a terrible calamity fell upon the wider\r\nprovince, of which Durham was only a part, when the Danes raided\r\nLindisfarne, where had been the starting-point of the Northumbrian\r\nChurch. When the mother was thus spoiled and laid desolate, the\r\ndaughters trembled for their safety, but they were left for awhile, not\r\nunassailed, yet not destroyed. In those days of disturbed peace further\r\ngifts of land were made to the Church, and in these we trace large\r\nslices of Durham handed over in the ninth century to the monks of\r\nLindisfarne by those who had the power to give. And here we must notice\r\nthat the great treasure of the monastery at Lindisfarne was the body of\r\nSt. Cuthbert, the great Northumbrian saint, to whom the endowments named\r\nwere most solemnly dedicated. They formed the nucleus of the\r\nBishopric--the beginnings of the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert, which is\r\nonly another name for the Bishopric. Repeated invasion of the Danes at\r\nlast drove the monks out of Lindisfarne, and destroyed the Durham\r\nmonasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth. The Lindisfarne monks left their\r\nisland, and bore away for safety’s sake the body of St. Cuthbert, and\r\nafter various wanderings brought it back to rest within the fortified\r\nenclosure of Chester-le-Street, and so within the confines of Durham.\r\nHere the Danish conquerors confirmed previous gifts, and added others to\r\nthem, until the lands of St. Cuthbert increased very widely, whilst\r\nChester-le-Street became a centre of pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nFor 113 years Chester-le-Street was the Christian metropolis of the\r\nNorth, until the final fury of the Danes began to fall upon Northumbria.\r\nIn 995 another exodus began, and the clergy bore off the body to Ripon,\r\nreturning a few months later when the tempest seemed to have abated.\r\nMany legends cluster round this return, but in any case the fact is\r\nclear that the Bishop and his company took up their abode, not at\r\nChester-le-Street, but on the rocky peninsula of Dun-holm, or Durham,\r\nwhich the River Wear nearly encircled. In this way the seat of\r\necclesiastical authority was changed for the second time, and Durham\r\nCity now became the centre of the still-expanding Bishopric. Great\r\nprestige gathered round the Saxon cathedral in which the shrine of the\r\nsaint was placed, for Kings and Princes vied with one another in doing\r\nhonour to it. So Canute, walking to the spot with bare feet, gave fresh\r\ndonations of Durham land and confirmed what others had bestowed.\r\n\r\nBut again dark days fell upon the North. To say nothing of Scottish\r\nencroachments upon the Bishopric, which were sustained in the eleventh\r\ncentury, the worst blow fell when the Norman Conquest took place. In no\r\npart of England was a more determined patriotism opposed to William than\r\nin Durham. Submission was nominal, and desperate efforts were made to\r\nkeep Northumbria as a separate kingdom by placing Edgar Atheling upon an\r\nEnglish throne in York. When the Conqueror made a Norman called Cumin\r\nhis Viceroy in these parts, the men of Durham rose and murdered him\r\nwithin their city. It was an act that William never forgave and never\r\nforgot. He wrought such a deed of vengeance that the whole of the\r\nsmiling district from York to Durham was turned into a wilderness. When\r\nhe came to die he is represented to have said of this ruthless episode:\r\n\"I fell on the English of the Northern counties like a ravening lion. I\r\ncommanded their houses and corn, with all their tools and furniture, to\r\nbe burnt without distinction, and large herds of cattle and beasts of\r\nburden to be butchered wherever they were found. It was thus I took\r\nrevenge on multitudes of both sexes, by subjecting them to the calamity\r\nof a cruel famine; and by so doing, alas! became the barbarous murderer\r\nof many thousands, both young and old, of that fine race of people.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam placed foreigners in most positions of importance. To the See of\r\nDurham he appointed Walcher from Lorraine, and the new prelate came from\r\nhis consecration at Winchester, escorted across the belt of depopulated,\r\nravaged land, until he reached Durham. North of the Wear the Patrimony\r\nof St. Cuthbert was as yet largely untouched, but the men of Durham had\r\nno love for the foreigner, and no wish to regard him as their lord.\r\nFortunately for him the Earl of Northumbria stood his friend, and built\r\nfor him in 1072 the Norman castle overlooking\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait and Signature]\r\n\r\nthe Wear, which was destined to be the Bishop’s fortress for seven and a\r\nhalf centuries. Within that castle Walcher was safe, and, helped by the\r\nEarl, he ruled his recalcitrant flock, not always wisely, but with all\r\nhis power, until an insurrection which he strove to quell cost him his\r\nlife. He died, however, not as mere Bishop of Durham, but as Earl of\r\nNorthumbria as well, for when Waltheof the Earl died, William appointed\r\nWalcher in his place. Thus in the hands of the first Bishop after the\r\nConquest was held the double authority of Bishop and of Earl. Whatever\r\nmay have been the powers of the prelate in the Bishopric until this\r\ntime, it is certain that from this point he claims a double authority\r\nwithin the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert. As for Walcher, stern example was\r\nmade of what resistance to the Bishop’s lawful authority would mean,\r\nwhen William laid waste the land that had escaped ten years before, and\r\nextended his ravages north of the Wear and towards the Tyne.\r\n\r\nJust before the eleventh century expired, an event of considerable\r\nimportance took place when Bishop Carileph began the great cathedral\r\nwhich still crowns the height above the Wear at Durham. About the same\r\ntime an understanding was reached between the Earl of Northumbria and\r\nthe Bishop, by which all the rights and the independence of the\r\nBishopric seem to have been recognized and confirmed, so that\r\nhenceforward the Bishop was the undisputed lord of the lands of St.\r\nCuthbert.[2] When in 1104 the cathedral was sufficiently advanced to\r\nreceive the body of the saint within its eastern apse, a great ceremony\r\ntook place, which served to carry the prestige of Durham beyond anything\r\nit had yet reached. Henceforward the stream of pilgrims which had\r\nsteadily flowed to the shrine, whether at Lindisfarne, or\r\nChester-le-Street, or Durham, swelled in volume until the\r\nattractiveness of Durham exceeded that of any place of pilgrimage in\r\nEngland. Only when the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury drew to it so\r\nlarge a share of patronage from the end of the twelfth century did a\r\nserious rival manifest itself. Carileph had divided the territory of St.\r\nCuthbert, reserving part for the Bishop, and part for the Benedictine\r\nmonks whom he placed in the new cathedral. Thus the Bishop had his\r\nestates henceforward, and the monks had theirs. At first the portion\r\nbelonging to the monastery seems to have been disappointingly poor, a\r\nfact very probably due to recent ravages whose brand was not yet\r\neffaced. By degrees, however, the lands of prior and convent improved,\r\nand the gifts of pilgrims made the monks prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop who presided when the body of St. Cuthbert was translated in\r\n1104 was Ralph Flambard. He was not the character to allow the prestige\r\nof the Bishopric to decline. Under him the resources of the county were\r\nably administered, and the organization of his dominions was carefully\r\ndeveloped. By degrees the traces of the Norman harrying were\r\nobliterated. How fair a country Durham was in the early twelfth century\r\nwe may discover from the poetry of a monk from the monastery who was\r\ncalled Lawrence, and wrote a description of events and localities\r\nconnected with Durham. He speaks of its scenery, its excellent products,\r\nits fine breed of horses, its open-air amusements, to say nothing of\r\nindoor revels at Christmas. The twelfth century, with sparse population,\r\nopen moor and plain, and increasing prosperity, is far away from the\r\nnoise of anvil and forge, the smoke of endless coke ovens, the squalor\r\nof congested towns, as they exist in the county to-day. But the scene\r\nchanged too soon. After the accession of Stephen in 1135 fierce dynastic\r\nfeuds broke out, and the Scots joined in the anarchy of the time,\r\nattempting to annex the territory of St. Cuthbert to the Lowlands of\r\nScotland. Durham suffered severely in the conflict, and a mock-bishop,\r\nsupported by the Scots, actually held Durham Castle and City against\r\nthe lawful prelate. At length more quiet days came, and in the reign of\r\nHenry II. Bishop Pudsey, the King’s own cousin, succeeded in resisting\r\nthe centralizing efforts of the monarch, and although he had to bow to\r\nthe imperious Henry on more than one occasion, he carried on in the main\r\nthe liberties and rights of the Bishopric. A little later he was enabled\r\nto round off the Bishopric lands when he bought the wapentake of\r\nSadberge from King Richard, the only important part of the county which\r\nhad never yet been included in the territory of St. Cuthbert. From this\r\ntime the Earl of Northumbria disappears, and at last there is no rival\r\nwhatsoever to powers which had been steadily growing. The Bishopric is\r\nnow complete in head and members, and the Bishop is virtual sovereign of\r\nit, whilst the King is supreme outside. At this stage we may freely call\r\nthe Bishop’s dominions the Palatinate of Durham--a name which continues\r\nto be usual until the power so described is, in 1836, annexed to the\r\nCrown. The word \"Palatinate\" is a conventional legal title which the\r\nlawyers brought into fashion to describe a great franchise with its\r\nindependent jurisdiction.[3]\r\n\r\nWe are able to get a very much clearer notion of the Palatinate in\r\nPudsey’s days, when the hitherto scanty materials of Durham history\r\nbegin to swell. We have some of his buildings before us yet--St.\r\nCuthbert’s, Darlington, the Galilee of the cathedral, the rich doorway\r\nin the castle; we have seal and charters and writs of his episcopate;\r\nand, in short, are able to trace in outline the way in which Pudsey\r\ndeveloped the Bishopric on the analogy of a little kingdom, with\r\ninstitutions and officers of its own. Moreover, some notion is gained in\r\nthe famous Boldon Book[4] of the episcopal lands and how they were\r\nheld. There we get a Domesday, as it were, of the Bishop’s holdings, to\r\nwhich those who desire to study the intricate methods of medieval land\r\ntenure on the Bishop’s property must be referred. A little later on we\r\nfind somewhat similar information about the lands of the monastery, so\r\nthat, as the centuries wear on, a fairly detailed picture is gained of\r\nthe conditions of life in the medieval Bishopric. Thus we see the lands\r\ndivided up into a large number of manors, which vary largely in\r\ncharacter, for some are pastoral, others agricultural, others moor-land,\r\nor forest, and others still are connected with townships like Gateshead\r\nor Sunderland. The Bishop’s or Prior’s steward makes a circuit at\r\ndifferent times, visiting all the units in some special locality, and\r\nlooking to his lettings or his rents. The holdings vary very much in\r\nsize and in tenure, and the tenants likewise differ in status and in\r\nservice. There are villeins who are not free, and are bound to render\r\ncertain dues of personal service, mowing, or reaping, or ploughing, or\r\nsowing, for so many days, and receiving perhaps doles of food, a\r\ncottage, and some land, but no money wage. There are farmers who take a\r\nmanor or farm on condition of rendering so much agricultural produce to\r\nthe lord. There are cottiers who work so many days in the week, and have\r\nto give so many eggs, or so many fowls for the table, in return for the\r\nlittle home that they occupy. In Durham itself certain houses were let\r\nto tenants, who had to defend the North Gate, or help act as garrison,\r\nor render herbs and other necessaries for the Bishop’s kitchen. The\r\nconditions of service among the villeins were often onerous, and a tone\r\nof deep discontent is marked in the medieval villages of Durham. In time\r\nof war external service might be demanded of the men, and a rally to\r\njoin the Bishopric troops was no unfamiliar incident of life in those\r\ndays. If it extended beyond the bounds proper of the territory of St.\r\nCuthbert, pay was claimed, though it was not always given. Small\r\nquarrels and differences were probably adjusted by steward or bailiff,\r\nbut more serious cases came before justices of the peace specially\r\nappointed, whilst murder and other grave offences were reserved for\r\njudges whom the Bishop appointed to sit at various centres, of which\r\nDurham was the chief. And this power of appointing judges to try\r\ncriminals and to convict or acquit them is what is meant by the popular\r\nand inexact phrase, \"the power of life and death.\" The Bishop’s revenue\r\nwas managed by special officers of his own appointment, who got returns\r\nfrom the local bailiffs, and then recorded them at Durham, where a\r\nspecial audit was held. A special set of buildings were erected near\r\nDurham Castle, with various adjacent offices, for the management and\r\narrangement of all the mass of business--financial, judicial, and\r\nadministrative--which was entailed by the Bishopric.\r\n\r\nIn this way the conditions of life, and the administration of the\r\nPalatinate, followed roughly the general order of the kingdom outside,\r\nand the Bishopric was, as has already been said, virtually a little\r\nkingdom ruled by a Bishop instead of a King. The Bishops who followed\r\nPudsey maintained and developed his organization, but not without\r\nstrife. The thirteenth century, in particular, presents a long record of\r\nobstinate struggle between the Bishop and those who tried to limit his\r\npower or to gain concessions which he was unwilling to make. Indeed, the\r\nstruggle between the King and the people, which is the great feature of\r\nEnglish history in that century, finds a close parallel on a small scale\r\nin Durham. At one time it is a long feud between the Bishop and the\r\nMonastery over their respective lands, a feud which was at last ended by\r\nan agreement between the contending parties. At another time the Bishop\r\nis trying to curb the independence of the Barons of the Bishopric, who\r\nheld large estates for which they were supposed to yield homage, or to\r\nperform some kind of service. In this way Nevilles and Balliols, two of\r\nthe great Bishopric families, held out against the crusading Bishop Bek,\r\nand in the end they had to give way. And once more there was strife on\r\nmore than one occasion with the King, who now and then attempted to\r\nrestrain the exuberant independence of the Bishop of Durham; and here,\r\nin the main, the Bishop was successful in asserting his rights and\r\npowers as inalienable.\r\n\r\nOver this scene of complex organization and activity dark shadows came\r\nin the fourteenth century. The Scots, who had been quiescent for some\r\ntime, fell upon the Bishopric with great ferocity during the reigns of\r\nthe first three Edwards, and the years were seldom free from the record\r\nof invasion or pillage. It had come to be regarded as a prime duty of\r\nthe Bishop to repress all northern incursions, and, as a contemporary\r\ndocument puts it, to serve as a wall of brass against the Scots. He had\r\nhis fortified castles, Norham in Norhamshire, Durham in its own county,\r\nand Northallerton in Yorkshire. These three lay on one of the chief\r\nroutes by which the invaders entered England, and were kept in\r\nthreatening times well defended and provisioned. In 1312 Bruce pushed\r\nhis forces right through Northumberland, and advanced into the heart of\r\nthe Bishopric, delivering a blow against Durham itself, which must have\r\nbeen severe. Two years later in Scotland the troops of England were\r\nbeaten at Bannockburn, and the humiliation of Edward II. was only\r\neffaced some years later by Edward III. in the victories of Halidon\r\nHill, and more particularly of Neville’s Cross in 1346. The latter\r\nbattle was the great glory of the men of Durham until it was forgotten\r\nin the greater prestige of Flodden nearly 200 years later. The tomb of\r\nRalph Neville, badly battered by Scots in later days, still stands in\r\nDurham Cathedral as a local memorial of Neville’s Cross, in which he led\r\nthe Bishopric troops.\r\n\r\nThe joy caused by these successes was soon dimmed when the terrors of\r\nthe Black Death overwhelmed the district. Perhaps no part of England\r\nsuffered much more severely. The pestilence rolled up towards the North\r\nin the year 1349, and at last made its dreaded appearance in the\r\nsouth-east of the county. From this point it spread with frightful\r\nrapidity, carrying off all orders and conditions of men, for none\r\nescaped. Sometimes a whole household perished, and here and there an\r\nentire village was obliterated. \"No tenants came from West Thickley,\r\nbecause they are all dead,\" is the steward’s entry at one manorial court\r\nor halmote, as the local word is. In the winter that followed there was\r\nno sowing, and when the spring came men had not the heart to go to work\r\non the fields, for the plague was renewed with increasing virulence, and\r\neverything was thrown out of gear. Villeins had run away from sheer\r\nterror; even madness was not unheard of; and whilst there was little to\r\neat famine and misery stalked unchecked.[5] The Bishop’s lands and the\r\nPrior’s lands were going out of cultivation, for it was impossible to\r\nfind labourers, or to bind them down in the old way. Grotesque attempts\r\nwere made to keep up the former conditions of service, until by degrees\r\nstewards and bailiffs found out that they were face to face with the\r\ngreatest economic difficulty which had ever appeared in the Bishopric.\r\nThe Black Death practically brought to an end the rigid system of land\r\ntenure which had been kept up so long, for it gave the death-blow to\r\nserfdom, and the old services in kind, of which mention has been made.\r\nDiscontent had long lurked in the manors of Durham, but from this time\r\nit became active and aggressive, until it pushed the peasants out to\r\nassert themselves and to seek for more congenial conditions of life.\r\nElsewhere the transition was effected by bloodshed; in the territories\r\nof St. Cuthbert it came more peacefully, but to the accompaniment of\r\nmuch mutual mistrust and variance.\r\n\r\nIt is possibly in connection with all this covert rebellion on the part\r\nof the masses that Cardinal Langley built or finished the great gaol in\r\nthe North Gate in Durham. This large building running up to the castle\r\nkeep on one side, and down towards the river on the other, spanned\r\nSaddler Street for four centuries, until it was taken down in 1820. It\r\nwas often filled with criminals who were imprisoned here for various\r\noffences in its gloomy dungeons. There was another gaol at Sadberge, but\r\nit does not seem clear what relation this bore to the more important\r\nbuilding in Durham. But the fifteenth century brought its own special\r\nanxieties. In the dynastic troubles which led to the Wars of the Roses,\r\nthe Palatinate was generally Lancastrian in sympathy. Henry VI. (only\r\none of many English Kings who visited Durham) came to the shrine of St.\r\nCuthbert at a time when his dominions had been cut short upon the\r\nContinent, and were still further menaced by the Scots. In the bitter\r\ndays that followed, when he was driven from his throne, he took refuge\r\nin the Bishopric, whilst his brave wife went to the Continent to seek\r\nfor troops to enable him to regain the crown. Even rectories were\r\nfortified in those days, for men had to take one side or the other, and\r\nto defend their property against bands of marauders. Of religious\r\ntrouble and dispute, Durham had no large share at that particular time,\r\nthough elsewhere the ferment caused by the Lollard Movement was\r\nproducing much unrest. The Bishopric was too much under the control of\r\nthe Church to allow much freedom of thought. Yet there were isolated\r\ninstances of Lollard sympathy, exceptions to prove the rule, which were\r\ninstantly repressed by ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\nDynastic trouble did not end when Henry VII. and his wife, Elizabeth,\r\nunited the Red and White Roses. The Bishopric men, indeed, had no desire\r\nto rise against the strong government which the King set up in England;\r\nbut they were caught in the tide of rebellion which was set going by\r\nSimnel and Warbeck. It was to stem this tide that Henry placed Richard\r\nFox as Bishop of Durham in 1494. This prelate, the King’s tried friend,\r\nfortified afresh the castles of the see, and placed garrisons in them\r\nto check the advance of Warbeck through the northern counties.\r\nFortunately, the invasion followed another line to the Battle of Stoke,\r\nand the men of Durham were spared the anxiety of decision. But Fox,\r\nkeeping vigilant guard in his fortresses, was instrumental in concluding\r\nthat alliance which was destined eventually to unite the English and the\r\nScots as one nation. Henry’s young daughter, Margaret, was affianced to\r\nJames IV. of Scotland, and in 1503 passed right through the Bishopric on\r\nher way to her northern home. Nowhere in all the long progress did the\r\nPrincess receive a warmer welcome than in Durham, from the moment she\r\nentered the Bishopric at the Tees to the moment she crossed Tyne Bridge\r\nfrom Gateshead into Newcastle. A mighty banquet was given in her honour\r\nin Durham Castle, to which all the nobles and important personages of\r\nthe district were invited. Little Margaret’s great-grandson was James\r\nVI. of Scotland and I. of England; and in his days border feuds passed\r\naway for ever. And yet at the moment of the banquet that consummation\r\nwas a long way off. Ten years later the Scots invaded England at a time\r\nof grave national anxiety, when the King and his troops were warring in\r\nFrance. But the Bishopric musters turned out. Bishop Ruthall rushed up\r\nto Durham, and his men at Flodden contributed not a little to the great\r\nEnglish success as they bore the banner of St. Cuthbert into the battle.\r\n\r\nThe century that had so recently dawned was destined to witness great\r\nchanges in the Bishopric. Henry VIII. laid ruthless hands upon the power\r\nof the Church, and the monarch who extorted the submission of the clergy\r\nwas not likely to allow the great power and independence of the Bishop\r\nof Durham to pass unchecked. Accordingly, in 1536, he cut short the\r\njudiciary authority of the prelate. This, as we have seen, was one of\r\nthe most characteristic privileges of the Bishop, and neither Henry II.\r\nnor Edward I. had interfered with it. From this date the King was the\r\nauthority who appointed the judges; and although in practice the old\r\nforms and methods were largely followed, the sanction was royal, and not\r\nepiscopal. And next year, when the Council of the North was set up for\r\nthe purposes of defence, execution of justice, and finance, in the\r\nnorthern counties, a still further blow was aimed at the Bishop’s power,\r\nfor this court could, if it willed, supersede the Palatinate machinery.\r\nAs a matter of fact, its first President was Tunstall, Bishop of Durham,\r\nwho prevented such degradation of the Palatinate for the present. Yet\r\none thing of large importance was carried out under the Council’s\r\nauthority, when the great Abbey of Durham was dissolved in 1539. The\r\nmonastery had stood unassailed for 450 years, but Henry set going the\r\nprocess of destruction which ended in the total suppression of every\r\nreligious house in the land. It had been a wealthy foundation, a kindly\r\nlandlord, an influence for good in the district, with its library, and\r\nits schools, and its varied means of usefulness. Yet every good object\r\nthat it had served was eventually carried on. Prior and convent became\r\nDean and Canons; monastic lands were now capitular estates; its chief\r\nschool and library were maintained with greater efficiency; its solemn\r\noffices soon became the familiar vernacular service of the Church of\r\nEngland. Otherwise there was little monastic destruction in the county\r\nof Durham, for the great monastery had brooked no rivals; and a friary\r\nor two with a single nunnery were scarcely rivals. The dependent cells\r\nof Jarrow, Wearmouth, Finchale, however, shared in the fall of Durham\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nThree or four years before the surrender of the monastery the people of\r\nDurham had taken part in the Pilgrimage of Grace--that exciting\r\ndemonstration in which popular resentment against the fall of the\r\nsmaller houses was exhibited. When Durham Abbey fell, there was no\r\nrepetition of that rising, for severe punishment had been meted out in\r\n1537; whilst in 1540 pestilence was desolating the district, and the\r\ngloom in consequence was depressing. But there was no sympathy with the\r\nchanges which soon began to hurry on, and Durham was probably more\r\nopposed to the Reformation than any other district. Under Edward VI. the\r\nBishopric became the object of the ambitious designs of\r\nNorthumberland--one of the noblemen whom the rapid religious and\r\npolitical revolution of the time placed in power. He cast a longing eye\r\non the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert; and in building up the fortunes of his\r\nupstart family (he was a Dudley, not a Percy, for the true\r\nNorthumberland title was at the moment suspended) he probably intended\r\nto lay hands upon the whole Bishopric, and to arrogate for himself the\r\nPalatinate jurisdiction. He succeeded in getting the Bishop thrown into\r\nprison on false charges of treason, and then forced a Bill through\r\nParliament which abolished the power of the Palatinate, and created two\r\nsees--one at Durham, the other at Newcastle. There can be little doubt\r\nthat he intended to secure the Palatinate power for himself, and to rule\r\nin Durham as Duke of Northumberland; whilst his son, Guildford Dudley,\r\nrecently married to Lady Jane Grey, was to be Prince Consort, and to\r\nshare the throne of England. This most daring scheme fell to the ground\r\nwhen Mary came to the throne, and the recent legislation was at once\r\nabolished, and things went back to the conditions obtaining before the\r\nreign of Edward.\r\n\r\nUnder Elizabeth the Bishopric underwent a process of reconstruction in\r\nvarious ways. It was not a pleasant process. Socially the old system of\r\nland-tenure, which had been breaking up since the Black Death, was\r\nabolished, and a new method of leaseholds was evolved after much\r\nfriction between the tenants on the one side, and the Dean and Chapter,\r\nor the Bishop, on the other. The power of the Bishop was now further\r\nattenuated, for the Queen laid hands upon large estates which were the\r\nundoubted possession of the see, with a history of many centuries’\r\nattachment to the Patrimony of St. Cuthbert. The settlement of religion\r\ncarried out in the early years of the Queen’s reign was largely\r\nunpalatable in Durham. Certainly the majority of the clergy acquiesced,\r\nbut the acquiescence was largely external. So the people at large\r\ntolerated the changes that were wrought in churches and services, when\r\nthe English liturgy took the place of the Latin offices restored by\r\nMary, and when altars were broken down, and the church furniture in\r\ngeneral was destroyed. The great Bishopric families--Nevilles, Lumleys,\r\nand others--scarcely concealed their dislike of the new régime in Church\r\nand in State, and after some years of endurance, they rose at last in\r\n1569. Feeling sure of wide sympathy in Northumberland and Durham, the\r\nEarls of Northumberland and Westmorland gathered retainers together, and\r\nrestored the old order in Durham Cathedral, whilst the people of Durham,\r\nlowly kneeling, were absolved from the guilt of schism. But inferior\r\nleadership caused the rising to collapse outside the Bishopric, and when\r\nthe Queen’s army marched through Durham it swept the undisciplined\r\nforces of the Earls across the Tyne to be dissipated in the rigours of a\r\ncold Northumbrian winter. But, although the rebellion came to nothing,\r\npassive resistance was maintained. As the reign proceeded, this quieter\r\ncondition was roused into greater activity by the seminary priests and\r\nthe Jesuit missionaries who came into the country from institutions\r\nabroad, which sent over into England, and not least into Durham, a long\r\nsuccession of these emissaries. They went up and down the district,\r\nwelcomed and protected by friends who received their ministrations, but\r\nnot seldom hunted down by the vigilance of the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommission, which increased the stringency of its measures as the\r\ncentury drew to its close.\r\n\r\nThe last years of the great Queen witnessed a rather distressing\r\ncondition of things in the county. Pestilence was a frequent visitor in\r\ntimes that were insanitary, and the transition to happier conditions in\r\nreligion and in society was not complete. The villages were frequently\r\nunpopulated, and tillage was decayed, whilst the starving families\r\nwandered into the neighbouring towns in search of food. Probably the\r\ndepressing state of affairs was worse in the Bishopric than in other\r\nparts of England, for it received a special aggravation in the Scottish\r\ninroads, which were renewed towards the end of the reign before their\r\nfinal extinction at the accession of James. When the Elizabethan Poor\r\nLaw began its work, the county of Durham benefited by its operation, for\r\nregular collectors for the poor were appointed, and sometimes rates were\r\nlevied, in place of the very uncertain alms of the \"poor man’s box\" in\r\nthe church, to which parishioners were asked to contribute under the\r\nInjunctions of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe Stuarts showed more regard for the Palatinate of Durham than did the\r\nTudors. No Tudor sovereign, it seems, entered the county, but James I.,\r\nCharles I., and James II. when Duke of York, paid ceremonious visits to\r\nDurham, and in general upheld the prestige of the see, though they never\r\ncompletely restored its independence. One of the most interesting\r\nepisodes of the seventeenth century is the religious revolution carried\r\nout during the first forty years. Bishop Neile is credited with\r\nintroducing to Durham a series of prebendaries who altered the aspect of\r\nthe cathedral and produced great changes in the services. These\r\n\"innovations\" caused much comment, and although Charles in 1633 paid a\r\nspecial visit, and by his presence and countenance sanctioned what had\r\nbeen done, frequent remonstrance was made. The long reign of Elizabethan\r\nChurchmanship had accustomed the people to one uniform type of worship\r\nand ornament, and they were not prepared for the alterations now made in\r\nritual and in the appearance of the churches. When the Scots entered\r\nEngland in 1640, by way of remonstrance against the King’s policy in\r\nChurch and State, the Bishopric was not altogether unsympathetic; but\r\nwhen the armed demonstration proved to be an armed occupation extending\r\nover a year in duration, the royalism of Durham re-asserted itself. At\r\nthe outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 it was warmly royalist. A second\r\nScottish occupation after Marston Moor in 1644 kept this spirit in\r\ncheck, whilst the Long Parliament virtually superseded the Palatinate\r\nand governed the district by committees. Bishop, prebendaries, and other\r\nhigh ecclesiastics had fled when the Scots entered Durham in 1640.\r\nParliament now seized upon the lands of Bishop and Chapter, and sold\r\nthem or let them as opportunity offered. Thus for several years the old\r\necclesiastical constitution of Durham was destroyed, and in the parish\r\nchurches, carefully cleared in 1644 from all \"monuments of idolatry,\" a\r\nPresbyterian system was set up. It was not, however, fully carried out,\r\nand all manner of ministers were in possession when the Protectorate was\r\nset up in 1653. The cathedral services had long been silenced, and in\r\n1650 Cromwell used the buildings as a convenient accommodation for the\r\nScottish prisoners captured at Dunbar. On the petition of the people of\r\nthe county, the Protector undertook to establish a college in Durham and\r\nto devote the cathedral and castle buildings to that purpose. Resentment\r\nand discontent smouldered during these years of tyranny. Indeed, more\r\nthan one Royalist rising had to be repressed. When, at the beginning of\r\n1660, there was talk of restoring the King, no voice of dissent was\r\nheard in the county.\r\n\r\nExuberant loyalty greeted the Restoration. Cosin was made Bishop. He was\r\none of the group of influential men appointed by Neile forty years\r\nbefore, and now for twelve years he repaired the breaches of the city\r\nand diocese, and carried out the principles which he had formed in\r\nearlier life. The Palatinate jurisdiction was revived, with perhaps\r\ngreater lustre than it had exhibited for a century past. In these days\r\nof royalist triumph Nonconformist and Puritan scarcely ventured at first\r\nto show their heads, but in Durham they were only biding their time.\r\nThey found opportunity to promote a formidable rising, which was known\r\nas the Derwentdale Plot, aiming at some kind of overthrow of the\r\nrestored Church and Crown. It was badly managed, and speedily collapsed;\r\nbut Anabaptists, Quakers, and other parties managed to maintain their\r\nexistence despite strenuous measures, and more particularly despite the\r\nvigorous working of the Conventicle Acts which were intended to crush\r\nNonconformity.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the county of Durham accepted the Revolution in\r\n1688, though here and there some reluctance was manifested, and\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts of Bishop Crewe and Dean Granville to\r\npromote allegiance to King James. Jacobitism, indeed, was spasmodic in\r\nthe Bishopric, and it does not appear that in 1715 or in 1745 very wide\r\nsympathy was exhibited in the district when elsewhere the excitement was\r\nconsiderable. The eighteenth century witnessed two events of the\r\ngreatest importance in Durham history. In the first place, after a\r\nperiod of long stagnation, industrial development caught the whole\r\ndistrict and entirely changed its character. The coal trade had been\r\nprosecuted continuously since the thirteenth century at least, and the\r\nmines had proved a considerable source of revenue to the owners. Lead\r\nwas an ancient industry, and the salt-pans of the county have a\r\nconnected history, ranging over many centuries. These and other\r\noperations had increased in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nmore particularly when a great development of shipping at Sunderland and\r\nat Hartlepool took place after the Restoration. A large export trade by\r\nsea spread rapidly. In the early part of the eighteenth century 175,000\r\ntons of coal was the annual output on the Wear, and the history of the\r\ncollier convoys at that time is a large chapter in the general history\r\nof North Country shipping. All this meant a considerable increase of\r\nprosperity, and by degrees the county which had been thinly populated,\r\nfor the most part, became a hive of industry, in which rapid fortunes\r\nwere made. The mines and the shipyards attracted labour from other parts\r\nof England, and the population of the county, returned as 58,860 in the\r\nearly days of Elizabeth, amounted to 149,384 in 1801, a figure which has\r\nbeen multiplied by ten in the last hundred years. The Bishop and the\r\nDean and Chapter largely shared in the vast increase of wealth which the\r\nworking of coal-mines in particular produced. It cannot, however, be\r\nsaid with truth that the Church authorities neglected the cause of\r\ncharity. A list of the benefactions directly due to the various Bishops,\r\nand also to Dean and Chapter, shows how much they did in various ways\r\nfor the cause of education as well as for the spiritual well-being of\r\nthe people. Indeed, subscription lists of the early nineteenth century,\r\nwhich still survive, prove that the clergy gave the chief proportion of\r\nwhat was given when some public call was made. It must not be forgotten\r\nthat Durham University and Durham School were the direct foundations of\r\nthe Church within the Bishopric.\r\n\r\nThe other important event to which allusion has been made was the\r\nappearance of the Wesleyan Movement in Durham. Bishop Butler wrote his\r\nfamous work, the _Analogy_, in the western parts of the county, and\r\npublished it in 1736. It may be doubted whether its local effect was\r\nconsiderable. Within a few years John Wesley passed and repassed through\r\nthe county, and established his societies in Durham, Sunderland,\r\nDarlington, and elsewhere. They prospered exceedingly, and left a\r\npermanent impression upon the district, and this was deepened and\r\nextended when a fresh wave of Methodism travelled over the North of\r\nEngland early in the nineteenth century in connection with the spread of\r\nPrimitive Methodism. There can be no manner of doubt that the Methodist\r\nMovement deeply stirred and influenced some classes of the increasing\r\npopulation which the Church left untouched.\r\n\r\nThe real dividing-line between Old Durham and the present day is to be\r\nfound in the series of changes which took place in the reign of William\r\nIV. The spirit of reform was operating in various directions, and it was\r\nnot likely that Durham could escape. The increasing wealth of the Church\r\nand the still independent powers of the Bishop attracted the attention\r\nof the party of change. The Dean and Chapter rose to their opportunity,\r\nand founded the University of Durham. The newly formed Ecclesiastical\r\nCommission reduced the large staff of the cathedral, and reduced the\r\nstipends of those who were left. The Bishop was henceforth to be no\r\nlonger a great landowner, managing his own revenues and estates, but a\r\nprelate, like any other, drawing a fixed stipend. His officers went, and\r\nthe Palatinate jurisdiction which Dudley had coveted was finally annexed\r\nto the Crown. Thus to-day George V. is, within the confines of the\r\nBishopric, Earl Palatine of Durham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY MISS M. HOPE DODDS\r\n\r\n_Hist. Tripos, Cantab._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great North Road._\r\n\r\nThe Great North Road crosses the Tees by Croft Bridge, on which the\r\nboundary between Yorkshire and Durham is marked by a stone dated 1627.\r\nThis road is the \"Darnton Trod,\" along which criminals from the South\r\nsought refuge all through the Middle Ages. Once across the Tees the\r\nfugitive was safe, for the King’s writ did not run in the Bishopric.\r\nMoreover, this was the road to the great sanctuary of St. Cuthbert at\r\nDurham, where a man was safe from the vengeance of his enemies; and so\r\nit happened that Darlington became a great resort of evil-doers, and in\r\n1311 Bishop Kellaw issued a proclamation threatening with the terrors of\r\nexcommunication all those who molested merchants going to and returning\r\nfrom Darlington market. The ill-name of the neighbourhood was not lost\r\nafter the Bishop had been deprived of his own writs in 1536. The little\r\ninn of Baydale was the resort of the gentlemen of the road in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the rendezvous of Catton’s gang,\r\nthe haunt of Barwick and of Sir William Browne, all noted highwaymen of\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nThe first hamlet in Durham through which the road passes is Oxneyfield,\r\nwhere, in the fields by the wayside, may be seen the Hell Kettles, four\r\ndark, still pools, formed by the natural sinking of the soil over the\r\nsalt measures in the north bank of the Tees. There is a tradition that\r\nan Eastern diver, a black man, plunged into one of the pools, and\r\nreappeared in the Skerne, having discovered a subterranean connection\r\nbetween the two waters. The Black Man in North Country legends is\r\nusually the devil, and this story may be connected with the belief that\r\nthe Hell Kettles sometimes grow boiling hot, and that the devil \"seethes\r\nthe souls of sinful men and women in them,\" at which times the spirits\r\nmay be heard to cry and yell about the pools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARKET-CROSS AT DARLINGTON.]\r\n\r\nPassing by this haunted place the road leads on to Darlington, a borough\r\nfull of historical relics, from the Bulmer Stone in Northgate to the\r\nfirst locomotive at Bank Top Station. The Bulmer Stone is a large\r\nboulder of Shap granite, which was borne down to its present\r\nresting-place on a glacier in the Ice Age. Lying in the midst of the\r\nlevel, marshy plains of the Skerne, it formed a landmark for the men of\r\nthe Bronze Age, and was perhaps the origin of the town. An Anglian\r\nburial-ground, probably pre-Christian, was discovered in the town in\r\n1876. After the conversion of the North a church was built, and two\r\nSaxon crosses from it are preserved in the present Church of St.\r\nCuthbert. The history of this beautiful building does not come within\r\nthe scope of the present section. To the west of the church lies the\r\nmarket-place, where in 1217 Stephen de Cantuaria purchased half a pound\r\nof pepper at the fair on the Feast of All Saints, which he rendered to\r\nRoger Fitzacris as service for this land in Milneflach and elsewhere.\r\nFrom the market-cross in 1312 was read the Bishop’s order that a\r\ntournament which had been proclaimed at Darlington should not be held,\r\nas it was forbidden by the laws of the land. That market-cross is not\r\nstanding now, but its successor may be seen in the modern covered\r\nmarket, a plain column surmounted by a ball, which was erected in 1727\r\nby Dame Dorothy Brown, the last descendant of the family of Barnes,\r\nwhose members had held the office of bailiff of Darlington for over a\r\nhundred years. The old toll-booth, in which the bailiffs held their\r\ncourts, was pulled down in 1806 and replaced by the present Town Hall.\r\nEver since 1197, Darlington enjoyed the title of borough, and yet it\r\npossesses no early charters and had no corporate government; it was not\r\nvisited by the municipal commissioners in 1833, and was only\r\nincorporated in 1868. Until its incorporation the Bishop of Durham\r\nappointed a bailiff, who held the old manorial court of the borough.\r\nDarlington enjoys the distinction of having retained its bailiff until\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century, whereas in the other Durham towns\r\nthe Bishop had ceased to appoint bailiffs by the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The fame of Darlington rests on the fact that the first\r\npassenger railway-line in England was laid between Darlington and\r\nStockton by George Stephenson, who was supported by the capital and\r\ninfluence of Edward Pease of Darlington; the line was opened in 1825.\r\nThis is surely glory enough for any town!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD TITHE-BARN AT DURHAM.]\r\n\r\nGreat Aycliffe, lying five miles north of Darlington on the highroad,\r\nwas once one of the lesser forests of the Bishopric. About four miles\r\nnorth of Aycliffe the road crosses a little stream by the hamlet of\r\nRushyford. This was a desolate spot in 1317, when on September 1 Lewis\r\nBeaumont, Bishop-elect of Durham, and the Cardinals Gaucelin John and\r\nLuke Fieschi, with a numerous train of attendants, travelled towards\r\nDurham, Beaumont to be consecrated in the cathedral, the Cardinals to\r\nnegotiate a truce between England and Scotland. They had been warned at\r\nDarlington that the road was beset, and this warning, which they\r\ndisregarded, proved only too true, for as they crossed the gloomy little\r\nburn at Rushyford, they were set upon by the notorious freebooter, Sir\r\nGilbert Middleton, and his men. The Cardinals and their servants were\r\nstripped of their goods and allowed to continue their journey, but the\r\nborderers carried off the Bishop-elect to their fortress of Mitford\r\nCastle, and there held him to ransom, until the Prior and Convent of\r\nDurham by great sacrifices succeeded in redeeming him.\r\n\r\nThe next place of importance on the road is Ferryhill, a large modern\r\nvillage six and a half miles south of Durham. Few traces of the past\r\nsurvive here, except the fragment of an old stone cross, Cleve’s Cross,\r\nwhich is traditionally held to commemorate the slaying of a great wild\r\nboar, which ravaged Durham once upon a time, by a certain valiant Roger\r\nde Ferry, whose family long dwelt in the neighbourhood in great honour.\r\nAbout a mile to the south-east of Ferryhill is Mainsforth, the estate of\r\nRobert Surtees, the historian of Durham.\r\n\r\nMidway between Ferryhill and Durham the highroad crosses the River Wear\r\nby Sunderland Bridge, and passes through the suburbs into the city of\r\nDurham.\r\n\r\nA bird’s-eye view of the city of Durham even at the present day is\r\nsurprisingly beautiful. In the Middle Ages it would have served as a\r\nmodel for one of those fascinating little Jerusalems or Bethlehems,\r\nwalled, towered, and pinnacled, which the old Italian masters loved to\r\nperch on the craggy hills in the background of some sacred picture. The\r\nriver sweeps round three sides of the crag, which is crowned by the\r\ncathedral and the castle, and the narrow neck of land on the fourth side\r\nwas defended by a moat. The Prior’s borough of Elvet and the merchants’\r\nquarter of Framwellgate lay on the opposite bank of the river, and were\r\nconnected with the citadel itself by their bridges.\r\n\r\nThe monastic chroniclers of the see were chiefly interested in the\r\ndoings of the Bishop in his castle and the Prior in his cathedral, and\r\nthe occasional interventions of the Lord King in the quarrels of these\r\naugust persons; they tell comparatively little of the life and affairs\r\nof the burgesses themselves, the descendants of the men from between\r\nCoquet and Tees, who obeyed the summons of Earl Ucthred in 995, and\r\nhastened to Durham to raise a shrine worthy of St. Cuthbert, who cleared\r\nthe thick forest on the crag of Durham, divided the land by lot, and\r\nbecame the Haliwerfolc, the people of the Saint. Twice during the\r\neleventh century they were besieged by the Scots, and each time the\r\nenemy was routed. The heads of the slaughtered Scots were exposed in the\r\nmarket-place, where the great fair of Durham was held on September 4,\r\nthe Feast of the Translation of St. Cuthbert. There was also a fair on\r\nthe saint’s other festival, March 20; but the September fair was the\r\nmore important. The laws of the special peace of St. Cuthbert, which was\r\nproclaimed by the thanes and drengs before the fair opened, were written\r\nin an ancient Gospel-Book, and a copy of them is still preserved.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1068-69 Robert Cumin, the newly created Norman Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, advanced to Durham with his troops, but as the Normans\r\nlay there they were surprised by a sudden rising of the whole\r\npopulation, and slain almost to a man. A year later news came that\r\nWilliam himself was approaching Durham to avenge the death of Cumin,\r\nwhereupon Bishop Egelwin and the priests took the sacred body of St.\r\nCuthbert and such of the treasures of the church as they could carry and\r\nfled to Lindisfarne, followed by the people of the city, who dared not\r\nremain without the sacred relic. The whole multitude took refuge on the\r\nisland while William devastated Durham and Northumberland. At length\r\npeace was made, and St. Cuthbert and his followers returned to the\r\ndesolate city. In 1072 William visited Durham, and installed the\r\nforeigner, Bishop Walcher, in the see. About this time also the first\r\nNorman castle was built in the city to keep the people in check; but\r\nwhen Bishop Walcher ventured out of his stronghold in 1080 he was\r\nmurdered. Again William ravaged Durham, and the see was filled by Bishop\r\nWilliam de St. Carileph, who began to build the present cathedral, and\r\nwho founded the Benedictine monastery connected with it. To the new\r\nmonastery he gave forty merchants’ houses in Elvet, which formed the\r\nnucleus of the Prior’s borough of Elvet. The troubles of Durham\r\nrecommenced in 1140, when, the see being vacant, Durham Castle was\r\nseized by William Cumin, a nominee of King David of Scotland, who hoped\r\nthrough Cumin to annex the Bishopric. In the course of the struggle\r\nbetween the usurper and the new Bishop, William de St. Barbara, the\r\ngreater part of the city of Durham was reduced to ashes. There were four\r\nyears of desperate warfare before Bishop William entered his cathedral\r\ntown, and at last received the submission of Cumin. Even then there\r\ncould be no true peace while England was torn with civil war, and it was\r\nnot until after the death of Bishop William that a brighter day dawned\r\nwith the election of Bishop Hugh Pudsey. Bishop Hugh rebuilt the ruined\r\ncity, restored the fortifications, and added to the cathedral. He\r\ngranted the burgesses a charter, by which the customs of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne were confirmed to them, besides freedom from merchet,\r\nheriot, and toll. The city of Durham stands first in Bishop Pudsey’s\r\ngreat survey of the Bishopric (Boldon Book, compiled in 1183), when the\r\ncity was at farm for 60 marks. Records which relate to the actual life\r\nof the citizens do not begin until the fourteenth century. The earliest\r\nare various charters of murage, dated 1345, 1377, 1385, which authorized\r\nthe citizens to levy certain tolls, and to devote the proceeds to the\r\nrepair of the walls and streets. The city was governed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISHOP PUDSEY’S CHARTER.]\r\n\r\nby a bailiff, appointed by the Bishop, in the same way as Darlington. It\r\nis not until the fifteenth century that gilds are heard of in Durham. In\r\n1436 Bishop Langley granted a licence to several of the principal\r\ninhabitants to form the religious gild of Corpus Christi in the Church\r\nof St. Nicholas, in the market-place. This gild was closely connected\r\nwith the craft gilds of the town, which must have been in existence at\r\nthe beginning of the century. The first records of the gilds occur in\r\n1447, when the Shoemakers (Cordwainers) and the Fullers each gave\r\nrecognizances to the Bishop that they would forfeit 20s. to him and 20s.\r\nto the light of Corpus Christi if any member took a Scot as an\r\napprentice. The ordinances of the Weavers were enrolled and confirmed by\r\nthe Bishop in 1450, and in them reference is made to the play which was\r\nto be played when they went in procession on Corpus Christi Day. The\r\ngilds were not merely a picturesque feature of town life, they had also\r\na powerful influence on the development of the city. The corporation\r\ngranted by Bishop Pilkington’s charter of 1565--the first charter of\r\nincorporation which the city obtained--was probably modelled on the\r\ngoverning body of the Corpus Christi Gild. The governing charter of the\r\ncity until 1770 was granted by Bishop Toby Matthew in 1602, and by this\r\ncharter the Common Council of the town was to consist of twenty-four\r\npersons, two being chosen from each of the twelve principal companies by\r\nthe mayor and aldermen. When the city of Durham obtained Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation in 1678, the franchise of the borough could only be\r\nobtained by membership in one of the companies, and the procedure of\r\nadmission was therefore carefully regulated by the mayor and\r\ncorporation. But in 1761 Durham experienced two elections within a few\r\nmonths of each other, and the political excitement completely\r\ndemoralized the city. All restraints were thrown to the winds, and\r\nnumbers of new freemen were admitted in a most irregular manner. The\r\nreaction of this exciting time on municipal affairs was such that, in\r\n1770, more than half the number of the twelve aldermen had resigned or\r\nbeen removed, and it was therefore impossible to elect a mayor under the\r\ncharter of 1603, which consequently lapsed. The various feuds having\r\nbeen cooled by an interval of ten years, Bishop Egerton granted a new\r\ncharter in 1780, with provisions closely resembling those of the old\r\none, and under this charter Durham was governed until it was included in\r\nthe Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.\r\n\r\nThe North Road, on leaving Durham, follows the course of one of the\r\nRoman roads which passed through the county. It leads northward over\r\nFramwellgate Moor, and six miles from Durham passes through\r\nChester-le-Street, which lies on the banks of the Cone Burn. As the name\r\nindicates, a Roman camp was situated here, and numerous Roman remains\r\nhave been found. The monks who had fled from Lindisfarne in 876 with the\r\nbody of St. Cuthbert settled at Chester-le-Street after seven years’\r\nwandering, when peace had been confirmed by the agreement between Alfred\r\nand Guthred the Dane. It was the principal city of the see until 995,\r\nwhen Bishop Aldhune fled once more before the renewed invasions of the\r\nDanes. In Chester-le-Street the old custom is still kept up of playing a\r\nfootball-match, in which the whole village takes part, on Shrove\r\nTuesday.\r\n\r\nThe borough of Gateshead lies on the Tyne, eight miles north of\r\nChester-le-Street. The south end of Tyne Bridge was the site of a Roman\r\ncamp, and afterwards, in the seventh century, of a Saxon monastery,\r\nwhich was destroyed by the Danes. A little church which stood there in\r\n1080 was the scene of the murder of Bishop Walcher, who was killed by\r\nthe infuriated populace while he was trying to pacify a feud between his\r\nNorman followers and the Saxon nobles. The church was set on fire, and\r\nthe Bishop was killed as he rushed from the burning building. The traces\r\nof early Norman work in the present building show that it must have soon\r\nbeen rebuilt. The new church is first mentioned in 1256, when a\r\nprisoner who had escaped from the castle of Newcastle took refuge in\r\nGateshead Church. Gateshead’s only charter was granted by Bishop Hugh\r\nPudsey at some time between 1154 and 1183, and confirmed by his\r\nsuccessor, Bishop Philip of Poitou. The little borough lay on the\r\noutskirts of the Bishop’s forest of Gateshead, and the charter freed the\r\nburgesses to some extent from the tyranny of that very great man, the\r\nBishop’s Head Forester. In its form of government the borough was\r\nsimilar to Darlington. Gateshead has always been one of the principal\r\ncommercial centres of the county, and, though there are no signs of\r\ncraft gilds there, trade companies second in importance only to those of\r\nDurham existed from the reign of Elizabeth till the end of the\r\neighteenth century. The prosperity of Gateshead very early excited the\r\nalarm of Newcastle, and the history of the town is studded with the\r\nattempts of its jealous neighbour to suppress its trade. In the\r\nfourteenth century the efforts of the Newcastle Corporation were\r\ndirected against the fisheries and staithes on the south bank of the\r\nTyne, which were frequently destroyed by \"the malice of the men of\r\nNewcastle.\" In 1553 the two towns were united, but the Act was repealed\r\nby Queen Mary, who came to the throne in the same year. It was proposed\r\nto renew the union in 1568, but the anxious petitions of Gateshead, and\r\nthe opposition of several influential persons in the Palatinate,\r\nfrustrated the scheme. There are, however, several cases in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries of the interference of Newcastle\r\nwith the trade of Gateshead. These troubles were the price that\r\nGateshead had to pay for its advantageous position by the side of the\r\ngreater town. Gateshead was given one representative in the House of\r\nCommons by the Reform Act of 1832, and was incorporated by its inclusion\r\nin the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of Durham is now the south bank of the Tyne, but formerly\r\nthe Bishop’s jurisdiction extended over one-third of the river, and was\r\nmarked by a blue stone on Tyne Bridge. The old bridge, which stood where\r\nthe Swing Bridge is now, was built in 1248 to replace the Roman bridge,\r\nPons Ælii, which dated from _circa_ 119. In 1389 the burgesses of\r\nNewcastle carried off the Blue Stone, seized the whole of the bridge,\r\nand built a tower on the south end, which they held against the Bishop.\r\nIt was not until 1415 that Bishop Langley at length obtained judgment\r\nagainst the Corporation of Newcastle, and took possession of the tower\r\nwith all his chivalry. The tower stood until the great flood of 1771,\r\nwhen part of the bridge was swept away. After this catastrophe the whole\r\nwas rebuilt, the new bridge being completed in 1781. The High-Level\r\nBridge was built in 1849, and the present Swing Bridge replaced the old\r\nstone one in 1876. Meanwhile, the conservation of the River Tyne had\r\nbeen placed in the hands of commissioners, and the jurisdiction of the\r\nBishop over the river came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Durham to South Shields._\r\n\r\nThe city of Durham, lying almost in the centre of the county, is an\r\nexcellent point of departure from which to visit the other towns and\r\nplaces of interest in the Bishopric. The road which leads from the city\r\nto the mouth of the Tyne runs north-east from Framwellgate Bridge. The\r\nprincipal village through which it passes is Houghton-le-Spring, six and\r\na half miles from Durham. The place is closely associated with the name\r\nof Bernard Gilpin, the Apostle of the North, who in the reigns of Edward\r\nVI., Mary, and Elizabeth, was Rector of Houghton-le-Spring, and the\r\nchief instrument in spreading Protestant doctrines through the North.\r\nFrom here it is seven miles to the mouth of the Wear, where stands the\r\nflourishing port of Sunderland. In early records the town\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACK CRAWFORD’S BIRTH-PLACE, SUNDERLAND.]\r\n\r\nis usually called Wearmouth. It possesses two very interesting charters,\r\ndated respectively 1180-83 and 1634; nevertheless, it did not rise above\r\nthe level of a manorial borough until 1835, when it was included in the\r\nMunicipal Corporations Act. During the Civil War Sunderland was the\r\nprincipal centre of the Parliamentarians in Durham, which was on the\r\nwhole a Royalist county. The fact that Sunderland was an exception was\r\ndue to the influence of the family of Lilburne in the town, George\r\nLilburne, the uncle of the famous John Lilburne, being the only\r\nmagistrate in the borough during the war. At the same time the siege of\r\nNewcastle diverted the coal trade to Sunderland, and thus laid the\r\nfoundation of its present prosperity. The town is famous in naval and\r\nmilitary history as the birthplace of two heroes--Jack Crawford, who\r\n\"nailed the colours to the mast\" at the Battle of Camperdown, 1797, and\r\nSir Henry Havelock, who relieved Lucknow in 1857. The Sunderland Orphan\r\nAsylum was founded in 1853 by the Freemen and Stallingers of Sunderland,\r\nand endowed with the proceeds of the sale of the Town Moor, which had\r\nbecome exceedingly valuable in consequence of the building of the\r\nrailway. The road crosses the Wear, and enters the parish of\r\nMonkwearmouth.\r\n\r\nThe history of Monkwearmouth goes back to 674, when Benedict Biscop\r\nfounded there the monastery of St. Peter. The early history of the\r\nmonastery was recorded by the Venerable Bede, who relates how Benedict\r\nbrought over foreign masons and glass-workers to build his church, and\r\nbeautified it with sacred pictures brought from Rome. It was destroyed\r\nby the Danes towards the end of the ninth century, refounded by Bishop\r\nWalcher, _circa_ 1075, and finally annexed to the Convent of Durham by\r\nBishop William de St. Carileph in 1083. A cell of the convent was\r\nmaintained there until the Reformation, and Monkwearmouth continued to\r\nbe a manor belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Durham until it was\r\nincorporated with Sunderland.\r\n\r\nFrom Monkwearmouth the road runs parallel with the coast-line to South\r\nShields. Shield Lawe, at the mouth of the Tyne, was occupied in\r\npre-Roman times; an important Roman camp was built there; and later it\r\nwas one of the fortresses of the Saxon Kings of Northumbria, and the\r\nsite of St. Hilda’s first religious house, founded _circa_ 650. The\r\nlittle convent was overshadowed by Benedict Biscop’s great monastery of\r\nSt. Paul at Jarrow, and both fell before the onslaughts of the Danes.\r\nJarrow subsequently became a cell of the Convent of Durham, and the\r\nChapel of St. Hilda at South Shields kept alive the name of the\r\nfoundress. After centuries of struggle with the burgesses of Newcastle,\r\nwho put down the trade of South Shields with a high hand, the borough\r\nobtained Parliamentary representation in 1832, and incorporation in\r\n1850. In the seventeenth century the salt-pans of South Shields were a\r\nflourishing industry, but its chief importance is now its harbour. The\r\nfirst lifeboat was built and used there in 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Durham to Hartlepool._\r\n\r\nThe twenty miles of road between Durham and Hartlepool is of an\r\nuninteresting character; but the town of Hartlepool itself has a long\r\nhistory, which begins in 640, when St. Hieu founded a convent there, of\r\nwhich St. Hilda was afterwards abbess. The house was destroyed by the\r\nDanes, and Hartlepool disappears from history, to reappear at the end of\r\nthe twelfth century as a flourishing port belonging to Robert de Bruce,\r\nLord of Annandale. Hitherto it had not been included in the Bishopric of\r\nDurham, but in 1189 the overlordship of the whole district of Hartness\r\nwas bought by Bishop Hugh Pudsey from Richard I. The succeeding Bishop,\r\nPhilip de Poitou, obtained possession of the town, but not until the\r\nburgesses had bought a charter from King John in 1200, granting to them\r\nthe customs of Newcastle-on-Tyne, while the same King granted to William\r\nde Bruce, Lord of Hartlepool, the right to hold a weekly market and a\r\nfair at the Feast of St. Lawrence (August 10). The burgesses obtained\r\nanother charter from Bishop Richard le Poore in 1230, in which he\r\nconceded to them the right to form a Merchant Gild and to elect a mayor.\r\nFrom this time the burgesses of Hartlepool were able to manage their own\r\naffairs in their own way, and enjoyed more independence than there was\r\nin any of the other towns of Durham. Their chief misfortunes befell them\r\nafter Robert de Bruce became King of Scotland in 1305. Hartlepool\r\nescheated to the King of England, and in consequence the Scots felt a\r\nspecial enmity against it. The town was attacked more than once in the\r\nensuing wars, but the walls and ramparts, which had been built by Robert\r\nde Bruce (1245-95) made it one of the strongest places in the Bishopric.\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century these fortifications were\r\nstill among the finest specimens of Edwardian architecture in the\r\nkingdom, but when the trade of the town revived later in the century,\r\nthe ancient walls were pulled down to make way for the new pier and\r\ndocks, and hardly any trace of them now remains. In 1599, by the good\r\noffices of Lord Lumley, the burgesses of Hartlepool obtained from Queen\r\nElizabeth a charter of incorporation, under which the town was governed\r\nuntil 1834, when the conditions of the charter were not fulfilled, and\r\nit lapsed. The present governing charter of the town was obtained in\r\n1850. The borough of West Hartlepool has grown up in the nineteenth\r\ncentury on the south side of the bay on which Hartlepool stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Durham to Stockton._\r\n\r\nThe Durham and Stockton road passes through Bishop Middleham, where one\r\nof the Bishop’s manor-houses used to stand, and through Sedgefield,\r\nabout eleven miles from Durham, a market-town which received the grant\r\nof a weekly market and fair at the Feast of St. Edmund the Bishop\r\n(November 16) from Bishop Kellaw in 1312.\r\n\r\nThe borough of Stockton lies on the north bank of the Tees, twenty miles\r\nsouth of Durham. It is situated in the district which in early times\r\nformed the wapentake of Sadberg, and comprised all the lands lying along\r\nthe north bank of the river. The wapentake, which was purchased by\r\nBishop Pudsey in 1189, at the same time as Hartlepool, had a separate\r\norganization from the rest of the Bishopric, and its courts were held at\r\nSadberg, which is now a small village about three miles east of\r\nDarlington. Stockton itself, however, seems to have come into the\r\nBishop’s hands before the purchase of the wapentake, as it is included\r\nin the Boldon Book, 1183. The date of the incorporation of the borough\r\nis unknown, but there are grants by several of the Bishops, dated 1310,\r\n1602, and 1666, of a weekly market and a fair at the Feast of St. Thomas\r\nà Becket (December 29). There is also an interesting letter relating to\r\nthe customs practised both at Newcastle and at Stockton, which was sent\r\nby the Mayor of Newcastle\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PALACE, BISHOP AUCKLAND.]\r\n\r\nto the Mayor of Stockton in 1344 in reply to certain questions which the\r\npeople of Stockton had addressed to Newcastle as their mother town. The\r\nmunicipal government of the borough was in the hands of the mayor and\r\nthe borough-holders, seventy-two in number, until Stockton was included\r\nin the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Durham to Barnard Castle._\r\n\r\nThe road to Barnard Castle branches off from the North Road about a mile\r\nsouth of Sunderland Bridge, and travels south-west into Aucklandshire.\r\nThis district included Binchester, Escomb, Newton, and all the\r\nAucklands, Bishop Auckland, St. Andrew’s Auckland, St. Helen’s Auckland,\r\nand South Auckland. Aucklandshire lay on the borders of the Bishop’s\r\ngreat forest of Weardale, and the services of the tenants, as described\r\nin Boldon Book, were closely connected with the Bishop’s great\r\nhunting-parties in the forest. All the tenants had to provide ropes for\r\nsnaring the deer, and to help to build the Bishop’s hall in the forest,\r\nwith a larder, a buttery, a chamber, a chapel, and a fence round the\r\nwhole encampment, when the Bishop went on the great hunt. They also kept\r\neyries of falcons for the Bishop, and attended the roe-hunt when\r\nsummoned. In return for their services at the great hunt they received a\r\ntun of beer, or half a tun if the Bishop did not come, and 2s. \"as a\r\nfavour.\" The little town of Bishop Auckland was called a borough in the\r\nfourteenth century, when the weekly markets and the fairs held on\r\nAscension Day, Corpus Christi Day, and the Thursday before October 10,\r\nformed the chief commercial centre of the neighbourhood, but it has\r\nnever been incorporated, and is now an urban district.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Aucklandshire lies the barony of Evenwood, about a\r\nquarter of a mile west of the road. This was one of the early baronies\r\nof the Bishopric, held by the family of Hansard. Evenwood was bought by\r\nBishop Bek in 1294, and his successors maintained a manor-house and park\r\nthere. After passing by Evenwood, the road leads through Raby Park to\r\nStaindrop.\r\n\r\nStaindrop was one of the vills over which the Bishop and the Convent of\r\nDurham disputed at the beginning of the twelfth century. Bishop Ralph\r\nFlambard restored it to the monks by the charter of restitution which he\r\nexecuted on his death-bed; and they kept it out of the clutches of\r\nsucceeding Bishops by granting it in 1131 at an annual rental of £4 to\r\nDolphin, son of Ughtred, one of the progenitors of the family of\r\nNeville. Henceforward, Staindrop remained part of the Neville estates in\r\nthe Bishopric. In 1378 Bishop Hatfield granted to John Lord Neville the\r\nright to hold a weekly market and a fair there at the Feast of St.\r\nThomas the Martyr (December 21). The whole of the Neville estates were\r\nconfiscated in 1570, after the rebellion of the Earls of Northumberland\r\nand Westmorland in 1569, and Staindrop remained in the hands of the King\r\nuntil 1632, when it was purchased by Sir Henry Vane, from whom the\r\npresent owner, Lord Barnard, is descended.\r\n\r\nBarnard Castle is twenty-five miles from Durham, and lies on the north\r\nbank of the Tees. It did not form part of the Bishopric at the time of\r\nthe Conquest, and was granted by William Rufus to Guy Balliol in 1093.\r\nBarnard Balliol, his son, built the castle _circa_ 1132, and apparently\r\nfounded the borough, for the first extant charter, granted by his son\r\nBarnard to the burgesses of Barnard Castle _circa_ 1167, refers to the\r\nelder Barnard’s concessions to them. By this charter the burgesses were\r\ngranted the customs of Richmond (Yorks). Barnard Castle was a manorial\r\nborough, and is now an urban district. The burgesses obtained charters\r\nfrom Hugh (1212-28), John (_circa_ 1230), and Alexander, third son of\r\nJohn. All the Balliol estates in England were forfeited by John Balliol,\r\nsometime King of Scotland, in 1295. Barnard Castle was claimed by Bishop\r\nBek, but Edward I. granted it to Guy\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARNARD CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nBeauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Bishops of Durham made frequent efforts\r\nto obtain possession of the town, and although they were unsuccessful,\r\nthey obtained Parliamentary recognition of the fact that Barnard Castle\r\nwas part of the Bishopric. Richard III., by his marriage with Lady Anne\r\nof Warwick, became lord of the town, which Lady Anne inherited from her\r\nfather, the King-maker. Barnard Castle escheated to the crown in 1485,\r\nand was finally granted to the Earl of Westmorland. In 1569, on\r\nreceiving the news that the northern Earls had risen against the Queen,\r\nSir George Bowes of Streatlam seized and garrisoned the castle, where he\r\nwas besieged by the rebels; and although he was forced to surrender\r\nafter a ten days’ siege, the delay had given the royal troops time to\r\ncome up, and insured the defeat of the insurgents. After the rebellion\r\nBarnard Castle escheated to the crown again, and was leased to the\r\nvaliant Bowes. It was finally purchased by Sir Henry Vane in 1632 (see\r\nabove).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Durham to Alston._\r\n\r\nThe road from Durham to Alston, in Cumberland, passes by the field of\r\nthe Battle of Neville’s Cross, fought on St. Luke’s Eve, October 17,\r\n1346, in which David of Scotland, who had invaded England while Edward\r\nIII. and all his forces were in France, was defeated by the troops which\r\nhe contemptuously called \"an army of women and priests,\" because they\r\nwere raised by Queen Philippa, and the four divisions were commanded by\r\nthe Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the Bishops of Lincoln and\r\nDurham. The cross which Ralph, Lord Neville, erected on the battle-field\r\nwas destroyed in 1589.\r\n\r\nThe next place of interest on the road is Brancepeth, which lies four\r\nand a half miles south-west of Durham. The family of Bulmer of\r\nBrancepeth held one of the early baronies of the Bishopric (see under\r\nEvenwood); the estate finally descended to an heiress, the first of the\r\nmany noble ladies whose stories lend interest to the place. She married\r\nGeoffry de Neville, _circa_ 1150. Sixty years after, in 1227, there was\r\nagain a sole heiress to Brancepeth; she married Robert FitzMeldred, Lord\r\nof Raby, and her son assumed his mother’s name, becoming the first\r\nNeville of Raby and Brancepeth. When the Neville estates were forfeited\r\nin 1570, the Countess of Westmorland was allowed to remain at the\r\ncastle, and there, though beset by spies, she contrived her husband’s\r\nescape to Flanders. The surveys of the estate that were made in 1597 and\r\n1614 mention that wild cattle were preserved in Brancepeth Park, as they\r\nstill are at Chillingham. The escheated lands passed from one owner to\r\nanother. In 1769 they were again inherited by an heiress, Bridgit, the\r\nonly daughter of William Bellasis. She died five years after coming into\r\nher inheritance. The story goes that she pined away for love of a\r\nneighbouring squire, Robert Shafto, who had wooed and forsaken her; and\r\nthe old Bishopric song of \"Bobby Shafto\" is said to be the record of the\r\nbrief happiness of the lovelorn lady.\r\n\r\nThe market-town of Wolsingham lies sixteen miles west of Durham. It was\r\none of the Bishop’s forest vills, lying on the moors of Weardale; and in\r\nthe entry about it in Boldon Book mention is made of Ralf the Beekeeper,\r\nwho held six acres for his service in keeping the bees, which were sent\r\nout on to the blossoming heather in the twelfth century, as they are to\r\nthis day. Wolsingham lies on the north bank of the Wear, and, after\r\npassing through the village, the road follows the course of the river\r\nwestward to Stanhope, which lies in the lead-mining district of West\r\nDurham. Half-way between Wolsingham and Stanhope lies Frosterley, where\r\nare the quarries of Frosterley marble.\r\n\r\nStanhope itself lay in the heart of the forest of Weardale, and was the\r\nspot to which all those who owed hunting-service must make their way\r\nwhen the Bishop’s great hunt was proclaimed. In 1327 the English and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCEPETH CASTLE IN 1777.]\r\n\r\nScottish armies, commanded on the one side by Edward III., and on the\r\nother by the Earl of Murray and Sir James Douglas, lay encamped for some\r\ndays over against each other on the hills round Stanhope. No battle was\r\nfought, and the Scots withdrew by night, having deceived Edward by false\r\nintelligence. The remains of the earthworks in which the two armies\r\nentrenched themselves may still be seen.\r\n\r\nSt. John’s Chapel, seven miles west of Stanhope, is the last\r\nconsiderable village on the road to Alston before it crosses the\r\nboundary of Durham. The chapel is mentioned in the fifteenth century,\r\nand a market and annual fair were held there, but there were few\r\ninhabitants until the end of the eighteenth century. From St. John’s\r\nChapel the road leads up over the moors, past the sources of the Wear,\r\nand crosses the county boundary on Killhope Moor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLK-LORE OF THE COUNTY OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY MRS. NEWTON W. APPERLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever makes a study of the folk-lore of a county will find that its\r\ncustoms, beliefs, and superstitions, have their origin in immemorial\r\nantiquity. To find out the reason for many a curious and apparently\r\nfrivolous observance it is necessary to go back many centuries, to the\r\ntime when a nature-worship, already immeasurably old, was practised;\r\nwhen the sun and moon, fire, water, and earth, were personified by gods\r\nand goddesses. Festivals were held in honour of each, and stones and\r\ntrees, wells and rivers, had their temples and devotees. These were\r\noverlaid by and mingled with the successive rituals of Roman, Saxon, and\r\nDane, and finally were almost, but not quite, conquered by Christianity.\r\nThe older faiths made a stubborn resistance to the reformer, and though\r\nadapted and altered, many of their usages survive to this day.\r\n\r\nThe four great Fire Festivals of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter were\r\nChristianized and dedicated anew; some of the gods and goddesses were\r\nre-named as saints; and many of the rites belonging to their worship\r\nwere modified into Christian observances.\r\n\r\nBut the people kept their old superstitions, and placed their faith in\r\nthe charms and amulets belonging to the ancient worship. In the North\r\nespecially the old beliefs lingered long, and even now, in the twentieth\r\ncentury, many quaint customs are to be found. Most of the people who\r\npractise them could give no reason for so doing, and have certainly no\r\nknowledge of their origin. It is \"lucky\" to do this, and \"unlucky\" to do\r\nthat, is all they can say.\r\n\r\nThe county of Durham, though the especial patrimony and property of St.\r\nCuthbert, is particularly rich in legends and traditions, in places both\r\nhaunted and hallowed, and in old-world observances of all kinds. Many\r\nare the stories of giants, brownies, fairies, ghosts, witches, and\r\n\"worms\" or dragons, told of and in it.\r\n\r\nThe Gabriel Hounds--those monstrous human-headed dogs, whose pause over\r\na house is said to bring death or misfortune to its inmates--are still\r\nheard traversing the air, though they are seldom seen.\r\n\r\nTales of the Hand of Glory--that unhallowed taper made of the hand of a\r\nhanged man, holding a candle made of the fat of a murderer, whose light\r\nwould send all the inhabitants of a house to sleep, and enable a burglar\r\nto make his easy way throughout it--are still told.\r\n\r\nAnd the Fairy Hills near Castleton, Hetton-le-Hole, Middridge, and other\r\nplaces where fairies used to dance their nightly rounds, are still\r\npointed out. Cattle were often shot by their tiny arrows, and children\r\nfrequently wore necklaces of coral or of peony seeds, as otherwise they\r\nmight have been stolen and taken away to Fairyland.\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson, in his _Folk-lore of the Northern Counties_, is convinced\r\nthat there is firm faith in ghosts and their power of revisiting the\r\nearth throughout the whole county of Durham.\r\n\r\nWitchcraft is to some extent believed in. It is not long since an old\r\nwoman reputed to be a witch died at Aycliffe, and charms against their\r\npower have been, and are still, practised; indeed, they are still\r\n\"crossed-out\" by those who make the sign of the cross on loaves before\r\nthey are put in the oven, and by the butchers who make, or used to make,\r\na cross on the shoulder before selling it. A crooked sixpence, a piece\r\nof rowan-wood, or a four-leaved clover worn in the pocket, will keep\r\nthem away. A self-bored stone or a horseshoe hung over the bed or in the\r\nbyre will prevent their evil influence from harming either person or\r\nproperty; and should you be so unfortunate as to meet a reputed witch,\r\nit is well to close your fingers round your thumb, and repeat the rhyme:\r\n\r\n    \"Witchy, witchy, I defy thee,\r\n     Let me go quietly by thee!\"\r\n\r\nAnd there were wise men, and especially wise women, who knew many spells\r\nof might to be used against them and against fairies.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that a child born into this haunted country, and surrounded\r\nfrom his birth by signs, portents, and auguries, must carry through his\r\nlife a belief in the superstitions of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe day of birth is most important, for it always influences the\r\ncharacter and fortunes of the child.\r\n\r\n    \"Monday’s child is fair of face,\r\n     Tuesday’s child is full of grace,\r\n     Wednesday’s child is full of woe,\r\n     Thursday’s child has far to go,\r\n     Friday’s child is loving and giving,\r\n     Saturday’s child works hard for its living;\r\n     But the child that’s born on Sabbath-day\r\n     Is wise and bonny and good and gay.\"\r\n\r\nChildren born during the hour after midnight see spirits, and this\r\nuncanny gift continues through life. If born with a caul, the child will\r\nalways be lucky. Children born in May are said to be seldom healthy.\r\n\r\nA cake and cheese should always be provided before the birth of an\r\ninfant. These are cut by the doctor, and all present partake of them, on\r\npain of the poor child growing up ugly. The nurse keeps some of this\r\ncake and cheese, and when she takes the child to be christened she gives\r\nthem to the first person whom she meets of opposite sex to that of the\r\nchild. If boys and girls are being christened at the same time, the boys\r\nmust be christened first, as otherwise the girls would have beards, the\r\nboys none!\r\n\r\nBaptism is thought to be good for a child, and it is often said that\r\nchildren never thrive till they are christened. It is well if they cry\r\nduring the ceremony, for it means that \"the devil is going out of them.\"\r\nThere is some warrant for this belief, for until the time of Edward VI.\r\na form of exorcism, in order to expel the evil spirit from the child,\r\nwas still used in the Baptismal Service.\r\n\r\nA child who does not cry at baptism will not live.\r\n\r\nIt is unlucky to call a child by its future name until it has actually\r\nreceived it, and most especially should one avoid naming it after a dead\r\nbrother or sister. The child will probably die also, or, if it lives,\r\nwill never prosper.\r\n\r\nSome nurses will never put a child’s dress over its head until it is\r\nchristened, but always draw it up over the feet. I never could hear why.\r\nAnd the inside of the hands should not be washed during this time. Some\r\ngo so far as to say that the right hand should not be washed for a year,\r\nso as not to \"wash the luck away.\"\r\n\r\nBut before taking a child out of its mother’s room the careful nurse\r\nwill see that it does not go downstairs first, as that would mean a\r\ndescent in life for it. If it is impossible for it to go upstairs, she\r\nmust take it in her arms, and mount a chair or stool with it, thereby\r\nassuring it of a rise in life.\r\n\r\nThe mother should go nowhere till she has been churched, as she would\r\ncarry ill-luck to the house she entered.\r\n\r\nThe baby should receive three, sometimes four, presents when it first\r\nvisits another house. These are its \"almison,\" and consist of an egg,\r\nbread, salt, and sometimes a piece of money. The bread and salt are\r\nthings used in sacrifices; the egg has always been a sacred emblem; the\r\nmoney is for luck, and should be carefully kept.\r\n\r\nNever rock a cradle when empty, or you may rock another baby into it.\r\nAnd this is very likely to be the case if the reigning baby cuts its\r\nteeth very early, for, as the proverb says, \"Soon teeth, soon toes\"\r\n(another set of them). If it tooths first in the upper jaw, that means\r\ndeath in infancy. Later, on losing a tooth, the cavity should be filled\r\nwith salt, and the tooth thrown into the fire with the words:\r\n\r\n    \"Fire, fire, burn bane,\r\n     God send me my tooth again!\"\r\n\r\nIt is an ancient custom, when a family is sold up, to except the cradle,\r\nand leave it in the possession of its original owner.\r\n\r\nThe nails should not be cut for a year, or the child will become a\r\nthief. Bite them off, and all will be well.\r\n\r\nWhen the child grows older, the nails should never be cut on Friday or\r\nSunday. These are unlucky days, but, as the rhyme tells us, other days\r\ndo very well:\r\n\r\n    \"Cut them on Monday, cut them for health;\r\n     Cut them on Tuesday, cut them for wealth;\r\n     Cut them on Wednesday, cut them for news;\r\n     Cut them on Thursday, a pair of new shoes;\r\n     Cut them on Friday, cut them for sorrow;\r\n     Cut them on Saturday, a present to-morrow;\r\n     But he who on Sunday cuts his horn,\r\n     Better that he had ne’er been born!\"\r\n\r\nStill later in life, another verse says:\r\n\r\n    \"Sunday shaven, Sunday shorn,\r\n     Better hadst thou ne’er been born!\"\r\n\r\nThe hair should always be cut when the moon is waxing, and all clippings\r\nand combings should be burnt, or \"the birds will take it for their\r\nnests.\" Probably the original idea, like that attached to the clippings\r\nof the nails, was that they should be destroyed, lest some enemy should\r\nuse them to work an evil spell against the owner.\r\n\r\nIf the hair burn brightly when thrown into the fire, it means long life\r\nto the owner; if it smoulder, it is a sign of death.\r\n\r\nIf you swallow a hair, it will wrap itself round your heart and kill\r\nyou. Howitt tells this seriously as having caused the death of Herbert\r\nSouthey.\r\n\r\nThe mother should be careful to see that no child is allowed to jump\r\nover the head of another, as in that case the overleapt infant would\r\nnever grow. The Kafirs have the same idea, and some tribes will not play\r\nleap-frog for that reason.\r\n\r\nWhen a seventh son is born, it is still said that he ought to be a\r\ndoctor. He was anciently supposed to be able to cure the \"king’s evil\"\r\nby touching; and the seventh son of a seventh son had still higher and\r\nmore Divine attributes. If a seventh daughter appeared without any boy\r\nintervening, she was to be a witch.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy is old enough to put his instilled and inherited beliefs\r\ninto practice, he may charm the butterfly to alight on his hand by\r\nsaying (it must be said often enough!):\r\n\r\n    \"Le, la let, ma bonnie pet!\"\r\n\r\nIf he wishes for fine weather, he may sing:\r\n\r\n    \"Rain, rain, go to Spain!\r\n     Fair weather come again!\"\r\n\r\nThe snail will look out from its shell if he says:\r\n\r\n    \"Snail, snail, come out of your hole,\r\n     Or else I’ll beat you as black as a coal!\"\r\n\r\nAnd when stung by a nettle, dock-leaves are laid on the stung place, and\r\nthis rhyme chanted:\r\n\r\n    \"Nettle in, dock out;\r\n     Dock in, nettle out;\r\n     Nettle in, dock out;\r\n     Dock rub nettle out!\"\r\n\r\nIf he puts a horse-hair into water, it will turn into an eel.\r\n\r\nDurham schoolboys used, when they saw a rainbow, to make a cross of\r\nstraws or twigs upon the ground, in order to send it away, or, as they\r\nsaid, to \"cross out the rainbow.\"\r\n\r\nBorrow tells of \"the gipsy mystery of the trus’hul, how by making a\r\ncross of two sticks the expert in occultism could wipe the rainbow out\r\nof the heavens\"; and the charm might have its roots still farther back\r\nin the cross of Thor, anciently used to dispel rain and thunderstorms.\r\n\r\nIn Confirmation, those who are touched by the Bishop’s left hand will\r\nnever marry.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for marriage comes, it is important to choose a lucky day\r\nand season. The days of the week are thus fated:\r\n\r\n    \"Monday for wealth, Tuesday for health,\r\n       Wednesday the best day of all;\r\n     Thursday for losses, Friday for crosses,\r\n       And Saturday no luck at all.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well to avoid marriage in Lent, for\r\n\r\n    \"If you marry in Lent,\r\n     You’ll live to repent.\"\r\n\r\nAnd May is an unlucky month for weddings, as for births. But the time\r\nbeing happily settled, the bride must not hear the banns given out, or\r\nher children will be deaf and dumb, and neither she nor any of the\r\nguests must wear anything green. She should wear\r\n\r\n    \"Something old, something new,\r\n     Something borrowed, and something blue.\"\r\n\r\nThe day of the marriage should be fine, \"for happy is the bride whom the\r\nsun shines on.\" The bridal party is escorted to church by men armed with\r\nguns, which they continually fire. After the ceremony it is the\r\nclergyman’s privilege to kiss the bride; and outside the church people\r\nare probably waiting with \"hot-pots,\" of which the whole party must\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nAt St. Helen’s Auckland, and other villages, the \"race for the\r\nbride-door\" for a ribbon or kerchief is still customary.\r\n\r\nAnd it was formerly the custom to address complimentary verses to the\r\nbridal couple before they left the church. This was called \"saying the\r\nNominy.\" The verses differed, were of no great poetical merit, and\r\nalways ended with, \"Pray remember the Nominy sayer.\"\r\n\r\nThe word is evidently derived from _nomen_, the bride having received a\r\nnew name.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the wedding-ring means the loss of the husband’s love, and\r\nits breaking forbodes death.\r\n\r\nOf portents of death there are many. The howling of dogs; the flight of\r\njackdaws or swallows down the chimney; \"a winding-sheet\" in the candle;\r\nthe crowing of a cock at the dead of night; the hovering of birds round\r\nthe house, or their resting on the window-sill, or flapping against the\r\npane; and three raps given by an invisible hand, are all auguries of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIf thirteen persons sit down to a meal together, one of them will die\r\nbefore the year is out.\r\n\r\nThe custom of keeping the Vigil of St. Mark is not unknown. They who\r\nwish to know who of their fellow-parishioners will die during the coming\r\nyear must keep watch in the church porch from eleven to one, on St.\r\nMark’s Eve, for three successive years; then the doomed company will\r\npass into the church. But if the watcher fall asleep during his vigil,\r\nhe will himself die during the year.\r\n\r\nAt the time of death the door should be left open to afford free passage\r\nto the departing spirit. It is held that no one can die on a bed or\r\npillow containing the feathers of pigeons or of game of any kind; and\r\nall along the East Coast it is said that people usually die during the\r\nfalling of the tide.\r\n\r\nWhen the corpse is \"laid out,\" the death-chamber is shrouded in white,\r\nthe clock is stopped, and the looking-glass covered, to show that for\r\nthe dead time is no more and earthly vanity departed. There is also the\r\ndread that if the mirror were left uncovered the ghost of the dead man\r\nmight be reflected in it.\r\n\r\nA plate of salt is also placed upon the breast as an emblem of eternity.\r\n\r\nThose who come to see the corpse are expected to touch it, in token that\r\nthey are in peace with the dead. It is often said that if you do not\r\ntouch it you will dream of it. The coffin must be carried to the church\r\nby the old-established \"church-road,\" and the notion still prevails that\r\nthe way over which a body is carried to its burial thereby becomes a\r\nhighroad. Therefore in the case of private roads or bridges (the\r\nPrebend’s Bridge at Durham, certainly) a small toll is levied when a\r\nfuneral procession passes over it. The coffin-bearers are usually chosen\r\nso as to correspond with the deceased in sex, age, and position. In the\r\ncase of children and young girls, white scarves and gloves are worn; and\r\nif the dead person were a young unmarried woman, a \"maiden garland\" used\r\nto be laid on the coffin, and hung up in the church after the funeral.\r\nThere are, or were, some of these garlands hanging in the church of\r\nWitton-Gilbert, near Durham. These have a glove, cut out of white paper,\r\nin the midst.\r\n\r\nWhen arrived at the churchyard, the dead must be carried to the grave\r\nthe way of the sun (east, by south, west, and north, for \"ye wad no hae\r\nthem carry the dead again the sun; the dead maun aye go wi’ the sun.\"\r\nThis is an old British usage, and in the Highlands is called \"making the\r\ndeisul.\" It is practised to bring good luck; to go round in the opposite\r\ndirection (or \"withershins\") is an evil incantation, and brings\r\nill-fortune.\r\n\r\nIt should rain a little during the procession, for \"happy is the corpse\r\nthat the rain rains on!\"\r\n\r\nIt used to be customary for anyone meeting a funeral to stop for a\r\nmoment and take his hat off. This is still occasionally done.\r\n\r\nThe survivors should not grieve too much for the dead, as this hinders\r\ntheir repose.\r\n\r\nWhen the head of a house dies, the bees should be told of their master’s\r\ndeath, and asked to accept the new one, or they will all die.\r\n\r\nIt is said that if a loaf of bread weighted with quicksilver be allowed\r\nto float in the water, it will swim towards, and stand over the place\r\nwhere the body of a drowned person lies.\r\n\r\nThere is a remedy for most diseases in the shape of a spell or charm.\r\n\r\nWhooping-cough may be cured by passing the child under an ass; or by\r\ntaking some milk, giving half to a white ferret, letting the child drink\r\nthe rest. In Sunderland, the crown of the head is shaved and the hair\r\nhung upon a bush, so that the birds, carrying it to their nests, may\r\ntake the cough with it.\r\n\r\nFor epilepsy, a half-crown may be offered at Communion and then asked\r\nfor again, and made into a ring to be worn by the person affected.\r\n\r\nFor cramp, garter the left leg below the knee, or tie an eel’s skin\r\nround it.\r\n\r\nA more unpleasant remedy is that for a wen, for the touch of a corpse’s\r\nhand will cure it. \"Andrew Mills’s stob\" (gibbet) was once thought\r\nsovereign against toothache.\r\n\r\nWarts can be charmed away by taking a piece of raw meat (it ought to be\r\nstolen), rubbing the warts with it, and throwing it away. As the meat\r\ndecays the warts will vanish.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is bitten by a dog, the animal should be destroyed, for,\r\nshould it go mad at any time, the person bitten would be attacked by\r\nhydrophobia.\r\n\r\nSt. Agnes’s Fast (January 21) is thus practised: Two girls, each wishing\r\nto see their future husbands, must fast and be dumb through the whole of\r\nSt. Agnes’s Eve. At night, in the same silence, they must make \"the dumb\r\ncake,\" aided by their friends, then divide it in two parts, one of which\r\neach girl takes, walks backwards upstairs, cuts the cake, and retires to\r\nbed. Then dreams of the future husband should follow.\r\n\r\nAnd girls will stick a candle-end full of pins to bring their lovers to\r\nthem. Or, taking an apple-pip, and naming the lover, will put it in the\r\nfire. If it burst with a noise he loves, but if it burns silently his\r\nlove is nought.\r\n\r\nIf a girl wishes to meet her future husband, she must carry an ash-leaf\r\nhaving an even tip, and say--\r\n\r\n    \"The even ash-leaf in my hand,\r\n     The first I meet shall be my man.\"\r\n\r\nIf it is found difficult to rear calves, the leg of one of the dead\r\nanimals should be hung in the chimney. In Yorkshire, the dead calf is\r\nburied under the threshold of the byre, either practice being\r\n(unconsciously) a sacrifice to Odin.\r\n\r\n\"To work as though one was working for need-fire,\" is a common proverb\r\nin the North, and refers to the practice of producing fire by the\r\nfriction of two pieces of wood. This was done when the murrain prevailed\r\namong cattle, and the diseased animals were made to pass through the\r\nsmoke raised by this holy fire. This was considered a certain cure. When\r\ncattle have foul in the feet, the turf on which the beast treads with\r\nthe affected foot is taken up and hung in the open air. As it crumbles\r\naway, so will the diseased foot recover.\r\n\r\nAnd the water in which Irish and other stones have been steeped has been\r\nused in the Bishopric as a cure for disease for cattle.\r\n\r\nIf you seize the opportunities, which are many, you may have what you\r\nplease by wishing for it. But the condition is in every case the same:\r\nthe nature of the wish must be kept secret. You may journey to Jarrow,\r\nand sitting in Bede’s chair, make your wish; or, nearer at hand, there\r\nis a stone seat at Finchale Priory credited with the same power. If you\r\nsee a horseshoe or a nail, pick it up, throw it over your left shoulder\r\nand wish; and wish also if you see a piebald horse, but you must manage\r\nto do so before you see its tail.\r\n\r\nYou may wish, too, when you first hear the cuckoo, and when you see the\r\nnew moon.\r\n\r\nMuch reverence has in all ages been paid to wells. The Worm Well at\r\nLambton was once in high repute as a wishing-well, and a crooked pin\r\n(the usual tribute of the \"wishers\") may be sometimes still discovered\r\nsparkling among the clear gravel of the bottom of the basin.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1740 children troubled with any infirmity were brought to the\r\nVenerable Bede’s Well, at Monkton, near Jarrow. A crooked pin was put\r\nin, and the well laved dry between each dipping.\r\n\r\nPins may sometimes be seen in Lady Byron’s Well at Seaham. There was a\r\ncustom (which cannot now be practised, as the monument is railed in) of\r\nwalking nine times round Neville’s Cross. \"Then if you stoop down, and\r\nlay your head to the turf, you’ll hear the noise of the battle and the\r\nclash of the armour.\"\r\n\r\nThe weather-wise will tell you that if the leaves remain long upon the\r\ntrees in autumn it is going to be a hard winter, and will bid you notice\r\nhow the wind blows on New Year’s Eve:\r\n\r\n    \"If on New Year’s Eve the night wind blow south,\r\n     It betokeneth warmth and growth;\r\n     If west, much milk and fish in the sea;\r\n     If north, much cold and storms there will be;\r\n     If east, the trees will bear much fruit;\r\n     If north-east, flee it, man and brute.\"\r\n\r\nCandlemas Day (February 2) should also be observed:\r\n\r\n    \"If Candlemas Day be fair and bright,\r\n     Winter will have another flight;\r\n     If Candlemas Day be clouds and rain,\r\n     Winter is gone, and will not come again.\"\r\n\r\nSome pretend to prophesy the coming weather from that of the last three\r\ndays of March. These are called the \"borrowing days.\"\r\n\r\n    \"March borrowed from April\r\n     Three days and they war ill;\r\n     The first o’ them war wind and weet,\r\n     The next o’ them war snaw and sleet,\r\n     The last o’ them war wind and rain,\r\n     Which gar’d the silly puir ewes come hirpling hame.\"\r\n\r\nOf Michaelmas Day it is said: \"So many days old the moon is on\r\nMichaelmas Day, so many floods after.\"\r\n\r\nIf it rains on Friday it is sure to rain on Sunday--“wet Friday, wet\r\nSunday.\"\r\n\r\nWatch the cat as she washes her face, and if she passes her paw over her\r\near it will rain to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe oak and ash-trees are considered to prophesy the weather:\r\n\r\n    \"If the oak bud before the ash,\r\n     We shall be sure to have a splash;\r\n     But if the ash bud before the oak,\r\n     We shall have weather as hard as a rock.\"\r\n\r\nIf you will begin the year auspiciously, be careful that your first foot\r\n\"is a fair man.\" Men still go about to \"bring the New Year in,\" and\r\ntheir guerdon is usually a glass of whisky. On no account should a woman\r\nbe the first foot, for she would bring misfortune. But before this the\r\nNew Year has been ushered in by the ringing of church bells, and\r\nsounding of buzzers from all the collieries.\r\n\r\nNothing should be allowed to go out of the house on this day, for that\r\nwould mean a year of poverty, but as much as possible should be brought\r\nin, as that will insure a year of plenty; and for the same reason a new\r\ndress should be worn with money in its pocket.\r\n\r\nBe careful to avoid seeing the first moon of the year through glass;\r\ncourtesy to her, and wish.\r\n\r\nThe day before Shrove Tuesday is known as Collop Monday, and on it eggs\r\nand bacon should be eaten.\r\n\r\nPancakes, of course, are appropriate to Shrove Tuesday; in fact, it is\r\nbetter known in the North as Pancake Tuesday. Durham children still\r\nbelieve that on this day pancakes fall out of the mouth of the great\r\nmedieval knocker fixed on the north door of the cathedral, and are\r\nsometimes seen bringing plates or baskets to receive the dole, and sugar\r\nwith which to eat it.\r\n\r\nThe Pancake Bell still rings from the cathedral to call the faithful to\r\nconfession, though neither confessional nor pancakes are existent.\r\n\r\nFootball usually begins now and continues till Easter.\r\n\r\nCarlings, or grey peas soaked in water and fried in butter, are eaten on\r\nCarling Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"He who hath not a palm in his hand on Palm Sunday must have his hand\r\ncut off,\" so \"palm crosses\" were always made for Palm Sunday of willow\r\ncatkins, tied up with ribbon, and kept till next year.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday \"hot cross buns,\" a sort of teacake made with spice and\r\nsugar, and marked with a cross, are always made; and fig pudding, or\r\n\"fig sue,\" is eaten, in memory of the fig-tree cursed by our Lord when\r\nHe rode to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nNo blacksmith in the county of Durham would at one time drive a nail on\r\nthis day, in memory of our Lord’s crucifixion.\r\n\r\nGood Friday and Easter Sunday were both thought lucky days on which to\r\ncast the coats and caps of young children, or to short-coat them.\r\n\r\nYou must put on something new on Easter Sunday, or the birds will spoil\r\nyour clothes.\r\n\r\nPaste-eggs boiled hard and dyed with ribbons or wool, whinblossoms or\r\nonion peelings, are rolled on the grass, or \"jauped\" against each other\r\ntill broken, and tansy puddings should be eaten.\r\n\r\nBalls are often given to children and played with by them, this being a\r\nrelic of the custom of playing at \"handball\" at Easter.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday the boys may pull off the girls’ shoes; but on Easter\r\nMonday the girls may retaliate by pulling off the caps of the boys.\r\n\r\n\"All Fools’ Day\" is still kept to some extent, chiefly by schoolboys,\r\nwho send their victims to the chemist for oil of hazel, or \"strap oil,\"\r\nwhich they receive in a dry form from the irate shop-keeper!\r\n\r\nThey also wear oak-leaves on Royal Oak Day; and the choristers of\r\nDurham Cathedral go to the top of the central tower and sing anthems.\r\nThis, though now done in honour of the Restoration, was originally in\r\nthanksgiving for the victory of Neville’s Cross, and used to take place\r\nin October.\r\n\r\nAnd it is schoolboys, too, who keep Guy Fawkes’ Day in remembrance, for\r\nthe noise of crackers and fireworks and the excitement of a bonfire do\r\nvery much appeal to them. Guys are now seldom carried about, but are\r\nsometimes burnt.\r\n\r\nThe \"mell-supper\" in the county of Durham (from the Norse _melr_, corn)\r\nis akin to the Northumbrian \"kirn-feast,\" and is held when the last\r\nsheaf is brought in. When this is done, the farmer’s headman proceeds to\r\n\"shout the mell\":\r\n\r\n    \"Blest be the day that Christ was born.\r\n     We’ve getten mell o’ Mr. ----’s corn.\r\n     Weel won and better shorn.\r\n            Hip, hip, hip, huzza, huzza!\"\r\n\r\nThis last sheaf used to be dressed in finery and crowned with wheatears,\r\nhoisted on a pole, and all the harvesters danced round this \"kern-baby,\"\r\nor harvest-queen, who afterward presided over the supper. Mummers, or\r\n\"guisers,\" used to attend the feast, but all these usages are dying out,\r\nand the master often gives the harvesters money or ale instead of the\r\nsupper. This is the old autumn feast of the ingathering of the corn, and\r\nin Brito-Roman times the image was that of the goddess Ceridwen,\r\nanswering to Ceres. Later, it stood for the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nYou must not gather brambles after October, or the devil will come after\r\nyou! He is evidently about at this time, for when the brambles are\r\nspoilt at the end of the season, it is said that \"the devil has set his\r\nfoot on the bummelkites,\" this being their local name.\r\n\r\nHallow E’en sports are still practised, the mystic apple so often\r\nappearing in Celtic fairy-lore, playing a great part in them. Apples\r\nare ducked for in a tub of water with the mouth, the hands being clasped\r\nbehind the back. A small rod of wood is sometimes suspended from the\r\nceiling, a lighted candle being fixed at one end, and an apple at the\r\nother. The apple has to be caught by the teeth when it passes before\r\nthem, and if it is carefully pared, so that the peel comes off in one\r\nstrip, and this is flung over the left shoulder, it will form the\r\ninitials of the loved one’s name. Or it may be eaten before a mirror,\r\nand the lover’s face will be reflected therein; but on no account must\r\nthe worker of this spell look backwards.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas-tide Yule cakes and \"Yule dollies\" are made, these last\r\nbeing quaint figures made of dough, with currants to mark their features\r\nand the outlines of their dress. Furmety (wheat boiled in milk) is\r\neaten, the Yule log is burnt, and the Christmas stocking is hung up that\r\ngifts may be placed in it. Candles are still given by grocers; the\r\nfruiterer presents a bunch of mistletoe; children come round and sing\r\ncarols, bearing a box containing figures of the Virgin and Child. The\r\nsword-dancers or \"guisers\" come, perform a dance and sing a song, the\r\nwords of which vary considerably.\r\n\r\nFinally, as many mince-pies as you eat at Christmas, so many happy\r\nmonths will you have.\r\n\r\nHere is \"a copious catalogue of things lucky and unlucky,\" at least of\r\nthose considered as such in the Bishopric:\r\n\r\nIf you accidentally put on a stocking, or indeed any garment, inside\r\nout, it is most fortunate, and the mistake should not be rectified, you\r\nwill turn the luck.\r\n\r\nBut if you put a button or hook into the wrong hole while dressing in\r\nthe morning, something unpleasant will happen to you during the day.\r\n\r\n\"Sing before breakfast, cry before supper,\" is an oft-quoted proverb,\r\nperhaps deduced from the common belief that unusually high spirits\r\nportend coming misfortune.\r\n\r\nWhen a child first puts on a dress with a pocket in it, its father\r\nshould put some money into it; this means lifelong riches.\r\n\r\nOn putting on a new dress, a well-wisher will say to the owner, \"I wish\r\nyou health to wear it, strength to tear it, and money to buy another.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when a young tradesman first dons his apron, it is well to\r\nsay to him: \"Weel may ye brook your apron.\" This, if said by a lucky\r\nperson, will insure the young man’s success in life.\r\n\r\nIf a spider is found on the clothes, it means that money is coming to\r\nyou; and if clothes must be mended while being worn, you will lose\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nIf the hem of your dress persistently turns up, a letter is coming to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nIf your apron falls off, someone is thinking of you.\r\n\r\nThose who can always guess the time accurately will never be married.\r\n\r\nIf the nose itches, you will be annoyed; if the foot, you will travel.\r\n\r\nItching of the right hand, money is coming to you; of the left, that you\r\nwill have to pay money; of the ear, hearing sudden news.\r\n\r\nIf the right ear tingles, someone is defaming you.\r\n\r\nIf you shiver, someone is walking over your grave.\r\n\r\nA blessing is still invoked on people when they sneeze.\r\n\r\nMeeting eyebrows are fortunate; so is a mole on the neck, at least, it\r\nmeans health to the owner, but some say that it brings him in danger of\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nAlways enter a house with your right foot first; to enter with the left\r\nfoot brings ill luck to the inhabitants, and you must go back and repair\r\nthe mistake.\r\n\r\nIf you stumble, by accident, in going upstairs, you will be married the\r\nsame year; the same if you snuff out the candle (this omen is becoming\r\nrarer with the decline of tallow candles).\r\n\r\nIf two people wash their hands in the same basin, they are sure to\r\nquarrel before bedtime, but this may be prevented by making the sign of\r\nthe cross over the water.\r\n\r\nIf your eyes are weak, have your ears pierced, it will benefit them.\r\n\r\nIf a loaf be turned upside down after cutting, it is unlucky. Along the\r\ncoast they say that it causes a ship to be wrecked. The same if three\r\ncandles are placed upon the table.\r\n\r\nIf a loaf breaks in the hand while cutting it, you part man and wife.\r\n\r\nAnd spilling the salt is as ominous here as elsewhere, but you may amend\r\nyour luck by throwing a pinch three times over your left shoulder with\r\nyour right hand.\r\n\r\n\"Help me to saut, help me to sorrow,\" would be the answer to the person\r\nwho should offer to place salt on the plate of another.\r\n\r\nTo cross the knife and fork is a sign of bad luck. To give a knife cuts\r\nlove; it should always be paid for. Only last Christmas I gave a knife\r\nto an old friend, and she punctiliously sent a penny to me in payment\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nDo not lend a pin, your friend may take one, but it is unlucky to give\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNever begin anything on Friday, it will not prosper.\r\n\r\nIf you must pass under a ladder, cross your fingers and wish. The\r\nunsophisticated spit; and if you are walking with anyone wait for him to\r\nspeak first, and any ill luck that may be coming will fall on his head.\r\n\r\n\"Spitting for luck\" is still common enough. Hucksters and fish-women\r\nspit on the handsel (the first money they receive), and many\r\nhorsedealers do the same. Colliers, when considering a strike, used to\r\nspit on one stone together, by way of cementing their confederacy, and\r\nschoolboys used to spit their faith when making a challenge to fight.\r\nThis was considered a sacred pledge which it was thought a point of\r\nhonour to fulfil.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to point at the stars, or even to count them; you may be\r\nstruck dead for doing so.\r\n\r\nHawthorn blossoms should not be brought into the house; they are as\r\nunlucky as peacock’s feathers, which also should never be brought\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nAnd evergreens should not be burnt.\r\n\r\n    \"If you burn green,\r\n     Your sorrow’s soon seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe luck of three is much believed in. If you fail twice in trying to do\r\na thing, you will probably succeed in the third trial. \"The third time’s\r\ncatchy time.\"\r\n\r\nServants say that if they break one thing they are sure to break three,\r\na foreboding which not seldom comes true.\r\n\r\nAnd when the minute-bell of the cathedral rings once it is bound to ring\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\nIf you break a looking-glass, you will have no luck for seven years.\r\nSome say that it betokens a death in the house, probably that of its\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nIf a black cat enters the house, it must by no means be turned away, for\r\nit brings good luck.\r\n\r\n    \"Wherever the cat of the house is black,\r\n     The lasses of lovers will have no lack.\"\r\n\r\nKittens born in May are unlucky and useless, never keep them.\r\n\r\nIt is lucky, when you see the first lamb of the year, if its head is\r\nturned towards you; but unlucky, if its tail.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that hedgehogs suck cows as they lie asleep.\r\n\r\nA toad is poisonous; do not touch it.\r\n\r\nIn all ages the flight and behaviour of birds have been thought worthy\r\nof notice.\r\n\r\nWhen setting hens, the number of eggs should be odd (generally eleven or\r\nthirteen); if the number be even, you will have no chickens. A hen that\r\ncrows brings ill luck, just as does a woman who whistles.\r\n\r\nIf the hens come into the house, or if the cock crows on the threshold,\r\na visitor is coming. If you have money in your pocket and turn it when\r\nyou first hear the cuckoo you will be rich all that year; but if your\r\npocket be empty so it will remain. There is a small bird attending on\r\nthe cuckoo, generally a meadow-pipit. It is called in Durham the\r\ncuckoo’s sandy, and is supposed to provide its patron with food.\r\n\r\nWhen the peacock screams, it is going to rain.\r\n\r\nThe magpie is an unlucky bird because it would not go into the ark with\r\nNoah, but sat outside, \"jabbering at the drowned world.\"\r\n\r\n    \"One is sorrow, two mirth,\r\n     Three a wedding, four a birth,\r\n     Five heaven, six hell,\r\n     Seven the de’il’s ain sel’!\"\r\n\r\nBut if you have the misfortune to see one magpie you may nullify the\r\nomen by making the sign of the cross, or, as some do, by waving a hand\r\nat the evil bird, and saying, \"Mag, I defy thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe raven is thought to be an unlucky bird, though here in Durham city\r\nwe should think better of it, for one made the fortune of Sir John Duck\r\nby dropping a gold piece at his feet when he was a poor out-of-work\r\nbutcher-boy. He became a rich coal-owner, and in his memory coals are\r\noften called \"ducks\" in Durham; and the \"Old Duck Main\" still exists at\r\nRainton.\r\n\r\nIf rooks, or crows, as we call them here, desert a rookery, it means the\r\ndownfall of the family on whose property it is. Swallows, once sacred to\r\nthe Penates, and honoured as the heralds of the spring, are lucky, and\r\ntheir nests must never be pulled down, as they bring good fortune to the\r\nplace where they build, and it bodes ill luck if they leave a place they\r\nhave once tenanted.\r\n\r\nNaturally, much local lore has gathered round the cathedral, the great\r\nMother-Church of the diocese. The death superstition relating to the\r\nminute-bell, the ringing of the Pancake Bell, and the legend of the\r\nknocker, have already been mentioned. The Curfew Bell still rings at\r\nnine (the hour of compline), not at eight, as in other places, but\r\nnever on Saturday, because on the night of that day a man, who went\r\nalone to ring, was spirited away, and never seen again.\r\n\r\nWhen, on May 29, the choristers go to the central tower, they sing\r\nanthems on three sides only, and except the western side, because it was\r\nfrom this point that the man leaped whose tombstone is seen below. It is\r\na mutilated effigy of Frosterly marble, and is said to represent Hob of\r\nPelaw, holding the purse of money for which he risked and lost his life,\r\nand the fossils in the marble are said, by schoolboys, to be the coins\r\ncontained in it. Country people come, for some unknown reason, to draw\r\ntheir foot over the purse.\r\n\r\nCuriously, the churchyard here is on the north side of the church. The\r\ncloisters are ceiled with Irish oak, so that they never harbour dust or\r\ncobwebs, and the saying goes that if the Protestants were not always\r\ndoing something to the cathedral the Catholics could take it away from\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nThere is no church at Butterby, and you will often hear a man who is not\r\nin the habit of attending Divine worship spoken of as a \"Butterby\r\nchurchgoer.\"\r\n\r\nThese old-world beliefs and stories are fast fading away before the\r\nadvance of the schoolmaster; but they linger yet in the minds of old\r\npeople, and it will be long before they are quite forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PALACE GREEN, DURHAM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGENDS[6] OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY MISS FLORENCE N. COCKBURN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern counties are all rich in legendary history, and the county\r\nof Durham has its full share.\r\n\r\nCuriously, instead of most of the legends being of an ecclesiastical\r\nnature, as one would naturally expect in a county where the Church has\r\npredominated for many centuries, the contrary is the case. All the\r\nbest-known legends are of deadly war waged with some uncouth or\r\nvenomous monster, in which, without exception, some local hero,\r\nJack-the-Giant-Killer-like, comes off victorious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dun Cow._\r\n\r\nVisitors to Durham rarely leave without having the sculptured panel\r\nrepresenting the famous Dun Cow on the cathedral front pointed out to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe legend runs that the monks, having fled from Chester-le-Street and\r\nrested with the body of the saint for some time at Ripon, were desirous\r\nof returning to Chester. \"Coming with him (St. Cuthbert) on the east\r\nside of Durham to a place called Ward-lawe, they could not with all\r\ntheir force remove his body from thence, which seemed to be fastened to\r\nthe ground, which strange and unexpected accident wrought great\r\nadmiration in the heart of the bishops, monks, and their associates,\r\nand, ergo, they fasted and prayed three days with great reverence and\r\ndevotion, desiring to know by revelation what they should do with the\r\nholy body of St. Cuthbert, which thing was granted unto them, and\r\ntherein they were directed to carry him to Dunholme (Durham). But being\r\ndistressed because they were ignorant where Dunholme was, see their good\r\nfortune. As they were going a woman that lacked her cow did call aloud\r\nto her companion to know if she did not see her, who answered with a\r\nloud voice that her cow was in Dunholme, a happy and heavenly echo to\r\nthe distressed monks, who by that means were at the end of their\r\njourney, where they should find a resting-place for the body of their\r\nhonoured saint.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUN COW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brawn of Brancepeth._\r\n\r\nAt what time the brawn, or boar, ceased to exist as a wild animal in\r\nBritain is uncertain, but it was at one time a common inhabitant of our\r\nBritish forests, and protected by the law in the tenth and eleventh\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe village of Brancepeth (a corruption of Brawn’s path) is said to have\r\nderived its name from a formidable brawn of vast size, which made his\r\nlair on Brandon Hill, and walked the forest in ancient times, and was a\r\nterror to all the inhabitants from the Wear to the Gaunless. The\r\nmarshy, and then woody, vale extending from Croxdale to Ferry Wood was\r\none of the brawn’s favourite haunts. According to tradition, Hodge of\r\nFerry, after carefully marking the boar’s track near Cleves Cross, dug a\r\npitfall, slightly covered with boughs and turf, and then, toiling on his\r\nvictim by some bait to the treacherous spot, stood, armed with his good\r\nsword, across the pitfall--“at once with hope and fear his heart\r\nrebounds.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the gallant brute came trotting on its onward path, and,\r\nseeing the passage barred, rushed headlong on the vile pitfall to meet\r\nits death. It is generally believed that this champion of Cleves sleeps\r\nin Merrington churchyard, beneath a coffin-shaped stone, rudely\r\nsculptured with the instruments of the victory--a sword and spade on\r\neach side of a cross.\r\n\r\nAnother stone, supposed to be the remnant of a cross, stands on the hill\r\nnear the farm of Cleves Cross, and is said to have probably been raised\r\non the same occasion. It was not unusual, in England or abroad, when a\r\nman had slain a boar, wolf, or spotted pard, to bear the animal as an\r\nensign in his shield. We believe that the seal of Roger de Ferry still\r\nremains in the treasury at Durham, exhibiting his old antagonist, a boar\r\npassant. The seal of his daughter Maud, wife of Alan of Merrington,\r\nshows the boar’s head erased.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pollard Boar._\r\n\r\nA family of the name of Pollard was seated at an early period in the\r\nparish of Bishop Auckland; and one of their estates was called Pollard’s\r\nDene, and the ceremony of presenting a falchion to the Bishop soon after\r\nhis entrance into the See was performed by the possessors of Pollard’s\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe legend of how a Pollard gained this land runs as follows:\r\n\r\nThe King offered to anyone who would bring the head of a wild boar,\r\nwhich destroyed man and beast, to his palace \"a princely guerdon,\" and\r\nthe Bishop of Durham, who passed the greater part of the year at\r\nAuckland Castle, having also promised a large reward, a member of the\r\nancient family of Pollard determined to kill the brute, or die in the\r\nattempt. So this courageous knight armed himself, mounted his trusty\r\nsteed, and rode to the lair of the boar, and noted its track. After\r\ntying his horse to a tree, out of its regular course, he climbed a\r\nbeech-tree under which the monster often passed, and shook down a large\r\nquantity of ripe beechmast.\r\n\r\nThere he waited until the boar came, and had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nit make a good meal. In time it showed signs of drowsiness, and\r\ncommenced moving from the place. Pollard, feeling that the time had come\r\nfor action, made an onslaught on the boar. After so hearty a meal, it\r\nwas not in a fighting humour, but nevertheless made a fierce resistance,\r\nand taxed to the utmost the prowess of the knight. The encounter lasted\r\nthe greater part of the night, and the welcome rays of the sun burst\r\nforth as he severed the head from the trunk of the boar. Having cut out\r\nits tongue and placed it in his wallet, he decided to rest for a short\r\ntime under a tree; but a deep sleep overcame him, and led to a serious\r\ndisappointment, for when he awoke he discovered that the head had been\r\ntaken away. He was in great despair, for he had not the trophy to take\r\nto the King to obtain the promised prize; so, mounting his horse, he\r\nrode to the Bishop and told his tale, and, showing the tongue, his\r\nlordship, who was about to dine, rejoiced to hear the good news, and, as\r\na reward, promised the knight as much land as he could ride round during\r\nthe hour of dinner. When he next came before the prelate, he startled\r\nthe latter by intimating that he had ridden round his castle, and\r\nclaimed it and all it contained as his meed. The Bishop was loath to\r\npart with his stronghold, but was bound to admit the validity of the\r\nclaim, and eventually made a compromise by granting him an extensive\r\nfreehold estate known to this day as Pollard’s Land. These broad acres\r\nwere given with the condition attached that the possessor should meet\r\nevery Bishop of Durham on his first coming to Auckland, and present to\r\nhim a falchion with this speech: \"My lord, I, in behalf of myself as\r\nwell as several others, possessors of the Pollard’s lands, do humbly\r\npresent your lordship with this falchion, at your first coming here,\r\nwherewith, as the tradition goeth, he slew of old a mighty boar, which\r\ndid much harm to man and beast; and by performing this service we hold\r\nour lands.\"\r\n\r\nHutchinson, rather curiously, quotes a letter signed \"R. Bowser,\"\r\ncommencing: \"Sir, inclosed you have the speech my brother Pewterer gave\r\nme out of Lord Bishop Cosin’s old Book,\" in which the boar is described\r\nas \"a venomous serpent.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Longley, created Bishop of Durham in the year 1856, was the last\r\nBishop to whom the falchion was presented.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the Pollard family is an arm holding a falchion. As to the\r\nmissing head, it is related that while Pollard slept the head of the\r\nNorthumbrian family of Mitford passed, saw what had occurred, seized the\r\nhead, and rode with all speed to the King, and gained the reward. The\r\nchampion Pollard also sought an interview with His Majesty, and giving\r\nthe facts, showed that the head presented had not a tongue; he was,\r\nhowever, dismissed without any recompense, the King declining to\r\nentertain a second claim.\r\n\r\nThere is in the parish church of St. Andrew’s Auckland an old wooden\r\neffigy representing a knight in a suit of chain armour, cross-legged,\r\nwith his feet resting on a boar, and it is generally believed that this\r\nmonument was erected in memory of our hero.\r\n\r\nIn sequel it should perhaps be added that the Mitfords have for many\r\ncenturies borne as their crest two arms holding a sword pierced through\r\nthe head of a boar; and as a commentary, perhaps, upon the principle\r\nthat fortune\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILTON CASTLE FROM THE NORTH.]\r\n\r\nhelps those who help themselves, they flaunt the pious motto:\r\n\r\n                       GOD + CARYTHE + FOR + US.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cau’d Lad of Hilton._\r\n\r\nThe grey old castle of Hilton has long had the reputation of being\r\nhaunted by a bar-guest, or local spirit, known as the \"cau’d lad of\r\nHilton,\" or \"cowed lad of Hilton.\" His history, however, seems to be\r\nrather mixed, and to partake of the nature of the genuine ghost as well\r\nas that of a brownie. This brownie was seldom seen, but often heard\r\nengaged in playing pranks in the great hall, or in the kitchen after the\r\nservants had retired for the night. If they left the kitchen orderly and\r\nclean, the brownie, angered at having his work taken out of his hands,\r\nwould throw all the crockery and kitchen utensils about the room, so\r\nthat when the servants appeared in the morning a picture of confusion\r\nmet their eyes. Of course, as a rule, they found it worked best not to\r\nattempt to leave things tidy, and then the brownie would exert himself\r\nthrough the night, and all would be straight and clean for the maids\r\nwhen they rose.\r\n\r\nThe servants, however, engaged by the last Baron thought his pranks\r\nrather wearisome, and determined to attempt his banishment by the usual\r\nmeans employed in such cases--that is, by leaving for his express use\r\nsome article of clothing, or some toothsome delicacy to tempt his\r\npalate. They resorted to a green cloak and hood as the best means of\r\ndriving him away. However, the brownie knew what they were after, and\r\nmany a time during the making of the cloak and hood could be heard\r\nsinging in the dead of night--\r\n\r\n    \"Wae’s me, wae’s me!\r\n     The acorn is not yet\r\n     Grown upon the tree,\r\n     That’s to grow the wood,\r\n     That’s to make the cradle,\r\n     That’s to rock the bairn,\r\n     That’s to grow the man,\r\n     That’s to lay me.\"\r\n\r\nThe green cloak and hood were finished at length; the servants laid them\r\ndown before the fire in the great kitchen, and watched at a prudent\r\ndistance. At midnight the \"cau’d lad\" glided in, surveyed the garments,\r\nput them on, frisked about, and when the cock crew disappeared, saying--\r\n\r\n    \"Here’s a cloak and there’s a hood:\r\n     The Cau’d Lad of Hilton will do no more good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so disappeared for ever.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this brownie seems to have been confused with another\r\nghost.\r\n\r\nThe apparition of a boy who was killed by one of the Barons often used\r\nto be seen--sometimes, it is said, with his head under his arm.\r\n\r\nA Baron of Hilton, many years ago, ordered his horse to be got ready. He\r\nwas a passionate man, and a fearsome one to cross. The stable-boy\r\nfoolishly fell asleep. For awhile the lord waited for his horse, and\r\nthen, in a lively temper, went off to the stable and found the sleeping\r\nboy. He struck the boy with a hay-fork and killed him there and then.\r\nHorrified at what he had done, he covered the body with straw till\r\nnight, and then threw it into a pond at the south side of the park,\r\nwhere, many years afterwards, the skeleton of a boy was discovered. So\r\nruns the legend.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that a boy named Roger Skelton was killed by\r\nRobert Hilton, a brother of the then Baron, in July, 1609.[7]\r\n\r\nThere was a haunted room in the castle called the \"cau’d lad’s room,\"\r\nwhich was never used. Here, it is said, the spirit of the murdered boy\r\nmade its residence. For many years there has been no appearance of the\r\nghost, though there are persons who affirm that, if they have not\r\nactually seen it, they have heard it about the castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lambton Worm._\r\n\r\nIn Plantagenet days the Lord of Lambton had a godless son, who\r\ndesecrated the Sabbath by fishing in the Wear, and while so doing he\r\nhooked a strange worm with nine breathing-holes on either side of its\r\nthroat. This queer find he threw into a well near by, since known as\r\n\"the Worm Well,\" and here the worm grew until it was too large for the\r\nwell. It then emerged, and betook itself by day to the river, where it\r\nlay coiled round a rock in the middle of the stream, and by night to a\r\nneighbouring hill, round whose base it would twine itself. Meanwhile it\r\ncontinued to grow so fast that it soon could encircle the hill three\r\ntimes. This hill, which is on the north side of the Wear, and about a\r\nmile and a half from old Lambton Hall, is oval in shape and still called\r\nthe Worm Hill. In the meantime the heir of Lambton had turned over a new\r\nleaf, and departed as a Crusader to the Holy Land. The worm still grew,\r\nand came daily ravaging for food. The milk of nine cows hardly sufficed\r\nit for a meal, and if this were not forthcoming it slayed both man and\r\nbeast. Many knights tried their prowess against the worm, but with no\r\navail, for no sooner was the worm cut in two than the pieces grew\r\ntogether again. The poor Lord of Lambton was in sore trouble when, after\r\nseven long years, the heir of Lambton returned home, a much sadder and\r\nwiser man. Seeing the result of his former evil practices, he determined\r\nto kill the enormous beast. Several attempts he made without success,\r\nbecause the parts would come together whenever he cut it in two. At last\r\nhe consulted a witch of the neighbourhood, and she told him if he came\r\nto the fight clothed in armour studded with razors, and stood in the\r\nswift stream, he would conquer; but that he, like Jephthah, must kill\r\nthe first living creature that met him after the victory. So to meet\r\nthis latter difficulty he told his old father to listen, and when he\r\ngained the victory he would blow three notes upon his bugle, then his\r\nfather was to loosen his favourite greyhound, which would come to the\r\nbugle’s call.\r\n\r\nHaving made all preparations, the heir started on his mission. Standing\r\nin midstream, he waited the onset of the worm. It came, and seeing its\r\nenemy, wound itself about him; but as it tightened its hold, the razors\r\ncut it into many pieces, which, falling into the water, were swept away\r\nby the current, and so were unable to grow together again. Thus the\r\nvictory was won, and the bugle sounded; but the old lord, overjoyed at\r\nthe thought of his son’s victory, forgot to let loose the hound, and ran\r\nhimself to meet the conqueror. Here now arose a difficulty; the son\r\nwould not be a parricide. He went again to the witch, and she told him\r\nthat the only alternative was the doom that none of his family should\r\ndie a peaceful death, to the seventh, or some say the ninth, generation.\r\nTradition sayeth that this alternative was accepted, and that no head of\r\nthe family died on his bed for several centuries after.\r\n\r\nThere are two stone figures of some antiquity preserved at Lambton\r\nCastle. One of these is apparently an effigy of our hero in the middle\r\nof the fray, only the worm has ears, legs, and a pair of wings. The\r\nother figure is a female one, and marked by no very characteristic\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sockburn Worm._\r\n\r\nThe legend of the Sockburn worm is very similar to that of the Pollard\r\nboar. It is recorded in an old manuscript that Sir John Conyers, knight,\r\nslew a monstrous and poisonous wyvern, or worm, which had devoured many\r\npeople in fight, for the scent of the poison was so strong no person\r\ncould stand it. But before making this enterprise,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMBTON CASTLE IN 1835.]\r\n\r\nhaving but one son, he went to the church of Sockburn in complete\r\narmour, and offered up his only son to the Holy Ghost. The place where\r\nthis great serpent lay was called Graystane. The gray stone is still\r\npointed out in a field near the church. For more than six hundred years\r\nthe manor of Sockburn was held by the singular service of presenting a\r\nfalchion to the Bishop of Durham on his first entering the diocese, and\r\nit was the duty of the Lord of the Manor of Sockburn, or his\r\nrepresentative, to meet His Grace at the middle of Sockburn Ford, or on\r\nCroft Bridge, which spans the River Tees, and after hailing him Count\r\nPalatine and Earl of Sadberge, to present him with a falchion, saying:\r\n\"My Lord Bishop, I here present you with the falchion wherewith the\r\nchampion Conyers slew the worm, dragon, or fiery flying serpent which\r\ndestroyed man, woman, and child, in memory of which the King then\r\nreigning gave him the manor of Sockburn, to hold by this tenure, that\r\nupon the first entrance of every Bishop into the county this falchion\r\nshould be presented.\" The Bishop, after receiving the weapon in his\r\nhand, promptly and politely returned it, and at the same time wished the\r\nLord of Sockburn health and a long enjoyment of the manor.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony was last performed in April, 1826, when the steward of Sir\r\nEdward Blackett, the Lord of Sockburn Manor, met, on Croft Bridge, Dr.\r\nVan Mildert, the last Prince-Bishop of Durham. The tenure is mentioned\r\nin the inquisition post-mortem held on the death of Sir John Conyers in\r\nthe year 1396. The falchion was formerly kept at the manor-house of\r\nSockburn: the blade is broad, and 2 feet 5 inches long, and on the\r\npommel of the weapon, which is of bronze, are two shields; on one side\r\nare the three lions of England, as borne by the Plantagenet monarchs\r\nfrom John to Edward III., and the eagle displayed on the other side is\r\nsaid to belong to Morcar, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland. This relic\r\nwas also represented on one of the stained-glass windows of Sockburn\r\nChurch. On a marble monument, placed to the memory of an old member of\r\nthe Conyers family, the serpent and falchion were sculptured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pickled Parson._\r\n\r\nThe present rectory house at Sedgefield, erected by the Rev. George,\r\nViscount Barrington, was preceded by a castellated edifice, which, after\r\nserving the purpose of a rectory house for some years, was burnt down in\r\n1792. During a lengthened period previous to the destruction of the old\r\nhouse the inhabitants of Sedgefield appear to have been greatly\r\ndisturbed by the visits of an apparition known as the \"Pickled Parson,\"\r\nwhich, it was confidently declared, wandered in the neighbourhood of the\r\nrector’s hall, \"making night hideous.\" Whose wandering shade the ghost\r\nwas supposed to have been is explained as follows: A rector’s wife had\r\nthe ill-luck to lose her husband about a week before the farmer’s tithes\r\nfell due. Prompted by avarice, she cunningly concealed his death by\r\nsalting the body of her departed spouse, and retaining it in a private\r\nroom. Her scheme succeeded, she received the emoluments of the living,\r\nand the next day made the decease of the rector public.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Picktree Brag._\r\n\r\nPicktree, near Chester-le-Street, is famous for two reasons--first,\r\nbecause it was the home of the heroine of the popular song, \"Ailsie\r\nMarley,\" and, secondly, because it was the haunt of one of those\r\nmischievous goblins known as the Picktree Brag. Sir Cuthbert Sharp gives\r\nan account of the apparition, as told by an old woman of respectable\r\nappearance, of about ninety years of age, living near the spot, probably\r\nat Pelton. The old woman said: \"I never saw the Brag distinctly, but I\r\nfrequently heard it. It sometimes appeared like a calf with a white\r\nhandkerchief about its neck, and a bushy tail. It came also like a\r\ngalloway, but more often like a coach-horse, and went trotting along the\r\nlonnin, afore folks, settin’ up a great nicker and a whinney every now\r\nand then; and it came frequently like a dickass, and it always stopped\r\nat the pond at the four lonnin ends, and nickered and whinnied. My\r\nbrother saw it like four men holding up a white sheet. I saw then sure\r\nthat some near relation was going to die, which was true. My husband\r\nonce saw it in the image of a naked man without a head. I knew a man of\r\nthe name of Bewick that was so frightened that he hanged himself for\r\nfear on’t. Whenever the midwife was sent for it always came up with her\r\nin the shape of a galloway. Dr. Harrison wouldn’t believe in it, but he\r\nmet it one night as he was going home, and it ’maist killed him; but he\r\nnever would tell what happened, and didn’t like to talk about it, and\r\nwhenever the Brag was mentioned he sat tremblin’ and shakin’ by the\r\nfireside. My husband had a white suit of clothes, and the first time he\r\never put them on he met the Brag, and never had them on afterwards but\r\nhe met with some misfortune; and once when he met the Brag, and he had\r\nhis white suit on (being a bold man), and having been at a christening,\r\nhe was determined to get on the Brag’s back, but when he came to the\r\nfour lonnin ends the Brag joggled him so sore that he could hardly keep\r\nhis seat, and at last it threw him off into the middle of the pond, and\r\nthen ran away, setting up a great nicker and laugh, just for all the\r\nworld like a Christian. But this I know to be true of my own knowledge,\r\nthat when my father was dying the Brag was heard coming up the lonnin\r\nlike a coach and six, and it stood before the house, and the room\r\nshaked, and it gave a terrible yell when my father died, and then it\r\nwent chatterin’ and gallopin’ down the lonnin as if yeben and yerth was\r\ncomin’ together.\"\r\n\r\nThese northern ghosts or goblins have been very well described in the\r\nfollowing verse attributed to Ben Jonson:\r\n\r\n    \"Sometimes I meete them like a man,\r\n       Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound,\r\n     And to a horse I turn me can,\r\n       To trip and trot about them round.\r\n         But if to ride\r\n         My backe they stride,\r\n     More swift than wind away I go;\r\n         O’er hedge and lands,\r\n         Through pools and ponds,\r\n     I whirrey laughing, ho, ho, ho!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAME-PLACES IN THE DURHAM DALES\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM MORLEY EGGLESTONE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Julius Cæsar conquered Britain, he found the island peopled by\r\nCelts--a branch of the great family of nations called the Aryan, or\r\nIndo-European, which spread over the world from Central Asia. The\r\nWestern branches, which rolled in successive waves over Europe, included\r\nthe Celts, who, according to the Greek traveller Pytheas, were in the\r\nfourth century before the Christian era quite at home in Britain, for he\r\nthere saw growing in the fields corn which the farmers took in sheaves\r\nto the barns, in which were threshing-floors.\r\n\r\nIn Weardale, situated in the western and mountainous part of the county\r\nof Durham, and surrounded by brown and heath-clad fells, the ancient\r\nBriton lived in the limestone caves, and hunted in the oaken forests. In\r\nthe Wear Valley, near Hamsterley, and about seven miles east of\r\nStanhope, there is a remarkable relic of the ancient Britons. This\r\nancient fortification--like many other works constructed by the Britons\r\nof old, such as the Dene Holes of Essex and the Cliff Castles--has its\r\nname, and is called The Castles. The treasure of Heatheryburn Cave, at\r\nStanhope, consisted of bone knives and pins, boar tusks, bronze and jet\r\nornaments, spearheads and bronze celts, with prehistoric human skulls,\r\nshowing considerable activity of the natives who manufactured and formed\r\nthe various rude implements. Apart from these landmarks, there have come\r\ndown to us in names of places the Celtic roots the _ray_ and the _tay_,\r\nwhich we find in Lang Tay, the name of a small but long tributary stream\r\nof water in Burnhope; and in Reahope, a tributary hope to Stanhope, and\r\nwhich empties its waters into Stanhope Burn, a tributary of the River\r\nWear.\r\n\r\nThe Roman power seems to have been extended to Weardale, for the two\r\nRoman altars found at Bolihope and Eastgate, and the denarii found at\r\nWestgate, prove that this lead-mining dale was well known to those\r\nruling and wall-building people.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Romans left, the Anglo-Saxons--including the Jutes, the\r\nSaxons, and the English--established themselves along the eastern coast\r\nof Britain, and these tribes of the Teutonic family took a firm grasp of\r\nthe land, and planted the roots of the English nation.\r\n\r\nThough little more in the early Saxon period than a dense forest, in\r\nwhich wild animals and ancient Britons found shelter, Weardale\r\nultimately became an Anglo-Saxon district, influenced by the blending of\r\nthe Scandinavian element in dialect and names of places, owing to its\r\nproximity to the Danelagh on the south, and the Norwegian settlement in\r\nCumberland on the west. The whole of the Palatinate appears to have\r\nremained Saxon through the Danish rule except the northern banks of the\r\nTees. We know little of Weardale at this period. Situated amidst\r\nmountains, and lying next the Strathclyde, it was probably as much\r\nCeltic as Saxon; but the division of counties, however, was made in 953\r\nby the Saxon Edred, or Eadred, and the Weardale people would know their\r\ncounty, for, on the bleak and heather-clad fell of Burnhope, the limits\r\nof the Palatinate is marked by a pile of stones, called \"eade\r\nstones\"--evidently King Eadred’s stones--the boundary established by\r\nthat Saxon monarch. Weardale and Teesdale, however, under the power of\r\nthe Normans, were destined to be turned into desolate wastes; yet, as we\r\nshall see, the Saxon names of places survived the desolation of fire and\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the names of places in the Bishopric of Durham a century\r\nor so after the Danish rule had ceased and the Norman rule had been\r\nestablished, we shall find a large percentage of Saxon suffixes. In the\r\nBoldon Buke, A.D. 1183, there are some 151 names of manors, wards,\r\nvills, etc., in which, with a few other names in charters of about the\r\nsame period, we have 45 endings, or suffixes, in 175 names of places.\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon test-word, _ton_, figures in no less than 34 of these\r\nprincipal names of places: as Darlington, a settlement of the Deorlings;\r\nStockton, the stockaded town; Haughton, the haugh town; Morton, the moor\r\ntown; Norton, the north town; Essington, the home or settlement of the\r\nEssings, as the Herrings gave a name to Herrington. Of the other Saxon\r\nsuffices we have: _ley_ 25, _burn_ 14, _don_ 8, _worth_ 6, _ford_ and\r\n_ham_ 5 each; and the Celtic _hope_, common in the Anglo-Saxon North,\r\noccurs 8 times. Thus, 8 endings take up 105 of the names of places in\r\nBoldon Buke, the remaining 70 names having 37 endings. The Danish\r\ntest-words, _by_ and _thorpe_, only occur once each--Killerby and Thorp.\r\nThese names do not show that the Vikings made permanent settlements\r\nnorth of the Tees. In Teesdale we find in Domesday Book, A.D. 1086,\r\nLontune, Mickleton, Lertinton, and Codrestune, having the Saxon ending\r\n_tun_ or _ton_; but though the names of these places were English, the\r\nplaces themselves were, or had been, belonging to a Dane, for they were\r\nthen in the hands of Bodin, and had formerly been Torfin’s--a person\r\nnamed from the Scandinavian god Thunder, or Thor. Hundredestoft and\r\nRochebi have the Danish _toft_ and _by_, and, like many other names,\r\nsuch as Thorsgill and Balders Dale, point to the influence and power of\r\nthe Scandinavians and their heathen worship in the neighbouring dale of\r\nthe Tees.\r\n\r\nIn the five northern counties, Worsaae returns Danish-Norwegian\r\nplace-names in the following order: Westmorland 158, Cumberland 142,\r\nDurham 23, Northumberland 22, and Yorkshire in its three Ridings 405.\r\nThe ending _by_ occurs 167 times in Yorkshire, and _thorpe_ 95 times;\r\nwhilst 7 of each are ascribed to Durham, and but 1 of the latter only to\r\nNorthumberland. Yorkshire, however, on a closer inquiry, shows over 250\r\nnames of places containing the element _by_, and over 160 of that of\r\n_thorpe_, the former predominating in the North and West, and the latter\r\nin the East and West Ridings. Of the 83 names ending in the Norwegian\r\ntest-word _thwaite_, as mentioned by Worsaae, 80 occur in the northern\r\ndistrict, Yorkshire 9, Lancashire 14, Westmorland 14, and in Norwegian\r\nCumberland 43, whilst there are no _thwaites_ in Durham or\r\nNorthumberland. The evidence adduced from names of places thus goes to\r\nprove that the Angles of Durham and Northumberland, though under the\r\nyoke of the Danes during the ascendancy of the Scandinavian power, have,\r\nfrom their first settlement, continued on their adopted soil through all\r\nthe vicissitudes incident to the descents of the Britons from the\r\nwestern mountains, the inroads of the Picts and Scots, the ravages of\r\nthe Vikings, and the subduing marches of the powerful William of\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\nNorthumbria, as of old, may be divided into two provinces in respect to\r\nits place-names--Deira, the district of the Danes, and Bernicia, the\r\ndistrict of the Angles, the central boundary-line being the River Tees.\r\nThe Norse _beck_ and Anglo-Saxon _burn_ distinctively mark this line\r\nbetween these districts in the upper reaches of the valleys of the Wear\r\nand Tees. The mountain-range from Burnhope Seat, at the western confines\r\nof Durham, eastward to Paw Law Pike, forms the south division between\r\nthe parishes of Stanhope in Weardale and Middleton in Teesdale. The\r\nprincipal tributaries of the Tees, on the south of this ridge, are\r\n_becks_, whilst those on the Wear side are _burns_. In Weardale, at the\r\nnorth-western extremity, Scraith _Burn_ and Langtay _Burn_ contribute to\r\nBurnhope _Burn_. On the Tees side, rising within half a mile or so of\r\nthe above burns, Ashgill _Beck_ contributes its waters to Harewood\r\n_Beck_. Farther eastward we have Harthope _Burn_ on the Weardale side,\r\nand Harthope _Beck_, which runs into Langdon _Beck_, on the Teesdale\r\nside, both streams rising on Harthope Fell, and within a few yards of\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nContinuing eastward, we find several _becks_ on the southern border of\r\nthe county of Durham. In 1672 a Teesdale stream was named Raygill Burn,\r\nhaving the Celtic _ray_, the Norse _gill_, and the Saxon _burn_. In the\r\nadjoining parish of Wolsingham, in the Wear valley, nearly all the\r\ntributaries are named _becks_ in the Ordnance map, but these are, with\r\none or two exceptions, originally all _burns_. In an old document of\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s time we find in this parish, Wascrow _Burn_,\r\nWesterharehope _Burn_, Hadderly Clough _Burn_, Houselop _Burn_, Bradley\r\n_Burn_, Collier _Beck_ and Ells _Beck_. There do not appear to be more\r\nthan two _becks_ in this parish, Ells Beck and Holbeck, the latter a\r\nsmall runner near Holbeck House, the home of the Craggs family, one of\r\nwhom was the Right Hon. James Craggs, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIn the Wolsingham names of streams that of Wascrow is generally now\r\ncalled Waskerley; its real name, however, appears to be Westcrau, from\r\n_crau_, a crag or rock, and _west_; or its adjectival component might be\r\n_wæs_, water. Houselop is Ouselhope, the hope of the _Ousel_ or _Ouse_,\r\nWelsh _wysg_, Erse _uisge_, water. Ouse is a common river name.\r\n\r\nHaving so many Anglo-Saxon names of places in the eastern part of the\r\nBishopric of Durham, it is natural to suppose that the settled families\r\nof the Angles would send offshoots along the banks of the Wear, up into\r\nthe dale where the river had its source. Wolsingham--the Saxon\r\nmetropolis of Weardale, for its ancient manor included the whole of the\r\nWear valley westward--is the _ham_ or home of the sons or descendants of\r\na family of Franks, represented in Kemble’s English settlement names in\r\nWælsingas, and in the German Walasingas, a family who probably settled\r\nin the South of England and sent their sons to the North, for Durham,\r\naccording to Taylor, contained no original Anglo-Saxon settlements.\r\n\r\nEast of Wolsingham but a few miles is Witton, the _ton_, or town of\r\nwitness, Anglo-Saxon _witena-gemot_. North of Weardale lie Hunstanworth\r\nand Edmundbyres, so the dale of the Wear is surrounded by towns having\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon suffixes, _ton_, _ham_, and _worth_, except the Danish\r\n_byre_ of St. Edmund.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks of the Wear, three miles west of Wolsingham, is situated\r\nthe village of Frosterley. Here early settlers appear to have had an\r\nabode on the banks of the river. The present name of the village is\r\nevidently derived from the forest or foresters of the Bishops of Durham,\r\nwho resided here to manage the great forest westward, but the\r\nScandinavian personal name, Frosti, is worthy of consideration. There\r\nappears, however, to have been a far earlier settlement here. A very\r\nsmall enclosure near the river-side is named Bottlingham, but not a\r\nvestige of a settlement remains, and the name of the small plot of\r\nground is all that is now left. Bolihope, a tributary valley to the\r\nWear, and which empties its burn into the river a hundred yards or two\r\nbelow the place under consideration, was called, in Bishop Bec’s time,\r\nBothelinghopp. In these two names we have the _hope_ and the _ham_ of\r\nsome Anglo-Saxon settlers, named Pottel, which by the law of interchange\r\nmight become Bottel. Bodvulf, who died in 655, was canonized, having\r\nfounded the monastery of Ikano. This saint’s relics were dispersed,\r\nhence several churches are dedicated to St. Botolph, and Bottlebridge is\r\nSt. Botolph’s bridge. The old chapel at Frosterley was, according to\r\ntradition, dedicated to St. Botolph, and close to the chapel site there\r\nis Bot’s Well, a name which would appear to confirm the local tradition\r\nin respect to the dedication.\r\n\r\nStanhope, too, with its Anglo-Saxon initial syllable _stan_, a stone,\r\nand Celtic _hope_, had an older settlement in all probability than the\r\npresent town, which takes its name from the adjoining Hope, which is\r\nfull of rocks or stones. At the west end of Stanhope town there is a\r\nsmall stream called Allerton Burn, which gathers its waters near\r\nAllerton Riggs, lying north-west of Stanhope. The stream joins the Hope\r\nBurn, near Stanhope Hall, but where is Allerton? which is, or was, the\r\n_ton_ or town beside the allers or alders, or more probably the enclosed\r\nplace of some Saxon named Alder or Ealder, from Anglo-Saxon _ald_, old,\r\nand _hari_, warrior. The site of this place was most likely near\r\nAllerton Bridge at Stanhope Hall, and this old hall residence--the seat\r\nof the Fetherston-halghs, from the days of King Stephen--probably\r\nrepresents the spot which we are in search of; it occupies a tongue of\r\nland between the confluence of the Allerton and Stanhope Burns.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred years ago, persons bearing the Saxon names of Osbert,\r\nEthelred, Meldred, Goda, Aldred, Collan, and others, held lands at\r\nStanhope, and did service under the Bishops of Durham.\r\n\r\nConsidering the close proximity of the principal Danish settlement in\r\nEngland, that of Yorkshire, it would not be surprising if an inquiry\r\ninto local names of places revealed the fact that the followers of\r\nOdin’s prophetic raven had left a footprint of some value in the Durham\r\ndales. The most remarkable, if not unique, footprint of the adventurous\r\nNorthmen is preserved in the word _thing_, pronounced _ting_, which in\r\nnames of parishes and places points out the localities where the\r\nVikings, in their days of rule, held their outdoor national assemblies,\r\nand promulgated their national laws.\r\n\r\nWhen the daring Northmen touched the shores of England, subdued in the\r\nyear 867 Northumbria, and set up Inguar, the first Danish King, as\r\nruler, they brought with them, and implanted, their traditions and\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nIn Weardale there is a Thimbleby Hill, on the south side of the Wear,\r\nopposite Stanhope, and if the Danes were in this dale for the purpose\r\nof assembling a _thing_ or council, this hill is the one above all\r\nothers which they would have chosen. It has on the top a considerable\r\nflat, and it overlooks Stanhope Town on the north, commands a most\r\nexcellent view down the valley eastward, and up the valley westward,\r\nwhilst to the south lies a rising heath-covered ridge. The position of\r\nthe hill would at once recommend itself to the Danes, who always took\r\ncare to have their national courts held in places which would be free\r\nfrom surprise; and it is possible that Shield Ash represents the\r\nshealings of ash bows, erected for the accommodation of those attending\r\nthe court. Stanhope is in Darlington _Wapentake_, which word is Danish,\r\nand each wapentake had its court or _thing_. Presuming that the Danes\r\nheld a council at Stanhope, they do not appear to have established\r\nthemselves to any extent; but, as we find the Danish _toft_, as in Toft\r\nWell, and a place in Bolihope, named in Hatfield’s Survey Turpenstanes,\r\nthe boundary stones of _Thorfinn_, a Danish personal name, and that in\r\nA.D. 1183 persons holding the Scandinavian names of Russell, Thore,\r\nArkil, and a son of Turkill, held lands at Stanhope, it would not be a\r\nmatter of surprise if a Danish council did take place in Weardale, which\r\nis situated so close to the Danish district, and which was under the\r\nrule of the first Danish King in England.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking instances of the Norwegian element in Weardale,\r\nis what was fifty or sixty years ago the \"national\" winter sport of the\r\ndale. This was _skeeing_, the national sport of Norway. Within the\r\nmemory of a few of the oldest inhabitants no snowy winter passed in\r\nWeardale without this sport being practised to its full extent.\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous district of Weardale, one of the most important North\r\nof England rivers is cradled, and into this isolated highland dale the\r\nCeltic name of the Durham river has penetrated. Almost all the English\r\nrivers have retained the names given to them by the Celts, and _avon_,\r\n_dur_, _esk_, _rhe_, and _don_, are Celtic roots repeated, over and over\r\nagain, in names of streams, not only in England, but on the Continent.\r\nIn the name Nent Water, in Cumberland, we have the simple name \"water,\"\r\nand the Cymric _nant_, a hollow or valley formed by water--a common name\r\nin Wales. Writers mention Nant Lle as+ the vale of Lle; Nant Gwyrfai,\r\nthe vale of fresh water; Nant Frangon, the beavers’ hollow or ravine;\r\nand Pennant, the head of the valley. The little village Nenthead, on the\r\nwestern slope of Killhope, is the head of the valley. From the root\r\n_dwr_, water, and the frequently occurring Celtic _gwent_, an open\r\nregion, comes Derwent, the name of the stream on the north of Weardale,\r\nand of various other rivers in England. The local pronunciation,\r\nhowever, in the district of Derwent is _Darwen_, which suggests _dwr_\r\nand _gwen_, the clear water.\r\n\r\nThe River Wear is formed by the joint streams of Killhope and Burnhope\r\nBurns, which meet at Wearhead village. Its course through the dale is\r\nrapid, receiving many tributaries from the hopes. On reaching Auckland\r\nit takes a north-easterly course. \"And now,\" says Camden, \"the river, as\r\nthough it proposed to make an island, compasseth almost on every side\r\nthe chief city of this province standing on an hill, whence the Saxons\r\ngave it the name _Dunholm_. For as you may gather out of Bede, they call\r\nan hill _dun_, and a river island _holme_.\" The Wear, which enters the\r\nsea at Sunderland, was called _Vedra_ by Ptolemy, _Wirus_ by Bede, and\r\nin Bishop Pudsey’s time (1153-94) the name was written _Were_, the same\r\nas we find in Hatfield, 1380, Holinshed 1577, and Camden 1604. The\r\nlatter form is the proper modern spelling up to about the last century,\r\nwhen _Were_ became _Wear_, the present form of the name of St.\r\nCuthbert’s stream. Ferguson, on the authority of Pott, gives the\r\nSanscrit _ud_, _udon_, water, from which comes the German _wasser_,\r\nEnglish _water_, as the root of Ptolemy’s _Vedra_.[8] _Wirus_ suggests\r\nthe Celtic _gwyrhe_, rapid water. Perhaps _gwy_ or _wy_, water, and\r\n_garw_ or _arw_, rough, form the roots. The former root enters into the\r\nnames of several rivers, as the Wye, Edwy, Elwy, and others. In all the\r\nforms of spelling the river-name of Durham the letter \"r\" is\r\nconspicuous. It is the principal one in _arw_, which enters into the\r\nnames of several streams--the Ayr, Are, Aire, Arre, being variations of\r\nthis widely diffused root. The Welsh _rhe_, rapid, with _gwy_, may show\r\nequal claim to notice as first mentioned--namely, _gwyrhe_. Omitting the\r\ninitial _g_ in the first, and the middle letter in the second, root, we\r\nhave _wyre_.\r\n\r\nA _hope_ is a small opening running up to the mountain ridges as a\r\ntributary to a main stream. From the burns again branch out _grains_,\r\nwhich, fed by springs, issue from _brocs_. The _cleugh_, _gill_, and\r\n_sike_, contribute their waters generally to the burns, whilst a _well_\r\nmay come from a _dene_, and empty into the main stream. The western\r\ndales of Durham are pre-eminently dales of _hopes_. This word is the\r\nCeltic _hwpp_, a slope or hollow between hills--a little dale in which a\r\nstream of water gathers. These openings at the sides of the dale may\r\nvery properly be termed places of refuge, places of shelter for animals,\r\nsuch as the deer, and in these days we find sheep located in the various\r\n_hopes_, where they have their _heft_--a locality to which they become\r\nattached; Anglo-Saxon _hæft_, from the having a holding or place. The\r\nNorse _hop_ is a place of shelter or refuge. An inquiry into the\r\nBishop’s possessions of game in Weardale, nearly three hundred years\r\nago, particularly mentioned forests, parks, _hopes_ and pastures. The\r\nplace-name _hope_ is common throughout the hilly parts of Durham,\r\nNorthumberland, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire. In the neighbouring parish of\r\nWolsingham there are Harehope, Ouselhope, and Thornhope; in Allendale\r\nSwinhope, Sinderhope, Ellershope, and Mohope; the Boldon Buke records in\r\nthe Bishopric, Ayleshope, Rokehope, Cazhope, Refhope, Horsleyhope,\r\nHisteshope, Baldingehope, Burnhop, and Roueleiehope; and in Teesdale we\r\nhave Egleshope and Hudeshope. In Weardale we have the Hope, sometimes\r\ncalled Stanhope Hope, probably to distinguish it from the town of\r\nStanhope.\r\n\r\nIn Weardale there are sixteen _hopes_, distinguished in name by some\r\ncharacteristic feature, as represented in their respective initial\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\nBurnhope and Killhope, with Wellhope, are the three vales which\r\ncontribute their streams to form the Wear at Wearhead. The initial\r\ncomponents _burn_, _kil_ and _wel_, are all Anglo-Saxon, meaning water,\r\nand have been given according to the custom of the early settlers. From\r\nthe head of the River Wear, the hopes, striking into the hills\r\nencircling the head of the dale, are those out of which come water.\r\n_Burn_hope is the hope of the burn, Anglo-Saxon _burne_, a stream;\r\n_Kill_hope is from Anglo-Saxon _keld_, a fountain; we have also\r\nIcelandic _keld_, Danish _kilde_, Norse _kill_, a fountain or brook;\r\n_Well_hope from Anglo-Saxon _wyl_, _wel_, a well or fountain--hence they\r\nare all the hopes of water. _Kil_ is the Scotch and Irish word denoting\r\na church, and if the situation had been favourable, and had there been\r\nany evidence of a St. Godric having been located here, as at Wolsingham,\r\nwe might have had the hope of the _kil_, kirk, or church, but in Camden\r\nwe find _Kelhop_ and _Welhop_. Leland, at an earlier date, gives\r\n_Kelhope_ and _Welhop_, and Holinshed _Kellop_. Brocket says _keld_ is a\r\nword used in Yorkshire, Westmorland, and Cumberland, for a well or\r\nspring. Taylor gives _kell_ and _well_ as synonymous terms for a place\r\nfrom whence water flows. We read in Simeon of Durham of the Scots, in\r\nA.D. 1070, having marched through Cumberland and devastated Teesdale and\r\nthe parts bordering; then they came to the place called in English,\r\nHundredeskelde--that is, \"the hundred springs.\" Barnard Castle\r\nwater-supply comes from a place called Spring Keld.\r\n\r\nOne of the Bishopric knights at the Battle of Lewis was Sir Henry\r\nMerley, of Herkeld, in Witton; and Besanskeldes is a Boldon Buke\r\nplace-name. We thus have, at the western confines of the county of\r\nDurham, the hopes of water, and which pour forth their streams to form\r\nthe main river of the historic county of Durham.\r\n\r\nIreshope, Middlehope, and Westernhope, derive their initial components\r\nfrom their position. _Middle_hope occupies a central position in the\r\nforest. The first tributary burn to the Wear after its formation is, of\r\ncourse, the most western one, _Ire_shope, from Erse _iar_, the west.\r\nSnowhope, sheltered under the southern hills, retains patches of its\r\nwinter covering long enough, no doubt, to have warranted its\r\nname--_Snawhope_, as it was formerly written, Anglo-Saxon _snaw_, Danish\r\n_snee_, German _schnee_, Belgic _sneeuw_--a name given to many mountains\r\nsubject to being covered in winter, as Snafell in Iceland, Sneekoppe in\r\nBohemia, Sneeuw Bergen at the Cape of Good Hope, Snee Hatten in Norway,\r\nSnafell in the Isle of Man, and Snowdon in Wales. In respect to\r\nIreshope, there is the Anglo-Saxon _yrfe_, _erfe_, _irfe_, inheritance,\r\nfrom the root _ar_; Old English _ear_, _earth_, as the _Ar_yan races\r\nwere the tillers of the ground. There is also a root _ar_ applied to\r\nrivers, as the _Ayr_, _Are_, and _Aire_: Welsh _araf_, gentle; Gaelic\r\n_ar_, slow; Celtic _arw_, violent--some of which might apply.\r\n\r\nStanhope and Rookhope are characteristic names in a district of stone\r\nand rock. In the Boldon Buke and Hatfield’s Survey we have Stanhope,\r\nRokhop, and in the times of Bishop Beck, Stanehop, and Stanhop. The\r\nfirst components in these names are from Anglo-Saxon _stan_, German\r\n_stein_, Icelandic _sten_, Danish _steen_, a stone; and Gaelic _roc_, a\r\nmass of stone. The district is full of stones, as the many stone fences\r\nwhich net the whole of the inlands and the higher lands to the moors\r\ntestify. From Boltsburn village the Rookhope stream runs over successive\r\nedges of limestone and freestone, and culminates in a grand display by\r\nleaping over several picturesque linns at Eastgate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KEPIER HOSPITAL.]\r\n\r\nTwo of the place-names, Harthope and Swinhope, carry us back to the wild\r\nbeasts of the forest. One was the lodging-ground or resort of the hart\r\nor stag, Anglo-Saxon _heort_; and the other gets its initial component\r\nfrom Anglo-Saxon _swin_, _swyn_, a swine; Old German _suin_, traceable\r\nback to the Sanskrit _su_. The boar tusks found in Heatheryburn Cave,\r\nand the Roman altar at Stanhope Rectory, testify to Weardale being the\r\nabode of boars. The local word _aswin_, obliquely, Welsh _asswyn_, does\r\nnot apply to this place-name. A far more probable etymology is the\r\nCeltic _swyn_, holy. Charnock is of opinion that the several rivers\r\nnamed \"swine\" or \"swin\" may be from this root.\r\n\r\nBolihope, the name of a considerable subvalley on the south of\r\nFrosterley and Stanhope, is interesting, if not so easily explained. The\r\nname is evidently associated with the district of Frosterley, where the\r\nstream from Bolihope enters the Wear. At this village we have as\r\nplace-names Bottlingham and Bot’s Well, and the ancient chapel is said\r\nto have been dedicated to St. Botolph. Bishop Beck granted to Walter\r\nBerington twenty-seven acres of land in Bothelinghopp. The initial\r\ncomponent would suggest the Anglo-Saxon _botel_, _botl_, _botles_, an\r\nabode, mansion, or dwelling; also Norse _botl_, German _buttel_. Leo,\r\nhowever, says that very few Anglo-Saxon names of places are united with\r\nthis word. Bolton was formerly written Bodeltune. This, however, does\r\nnot appear to be the etymon of the name in question, as _botel_ and\r\n_ham_, both Saxon for a dwelling, would not be found in one name. A\r\nlarge number of names of places have the Saxon patronymic _ing_, which\r\noften forms the medial syllable, such as Wolsingham, Darlington,\r\nEasington, Washington, Heighington, and, if the medial syllable of the\r\nname under consideration be the Saxon patronymic, then it is an\r\nAnglo-Saxon place-name--the home of the sons of some Saxon named Bottel.\r\nBot is a Scandinavian personal name, but we find the Saxon Byttingas and\r\nPotingas, _Liber Vitæ_, Bota, and Frisian Botte. The personal name\r\nPottel--which by the law of interchange of initial letters might become\r\nBottel--would explain that the _hope_ and the _ham_ were belonging to\r\nthe son of some Saxon settler of this name, as elsewhere mentioned.\r\n\r\nBoltshope is a small offshoot from Rookhope. Bolt, as an iron-door bolt,\r\nis from Anglo-Saxon and Danish _bolt_, German _bolgen_, from the root\r\n_bole_, round as the bole of a tree. The Anglo-Saxon _bold_, _bolt_,\r\noriginally _búld_, _búlt_, means a house or dwelling, an abode; Danish\r\n_bolig_; and we have mention made in Hatfield of Bold Shell in Rookhope.\r\nBoltsburn is the village of the Rookhope Valley, and is situated at the\r\nfoot of Boltshopeburn. At the top of the hope is Bolts Law, which is\r\nprobably the place earliest named, and in all probability is from a\r\npersonal name. Bold Shield would not be from the Anglo-Saxon _bold_, an\r\nabode, but is evidently Bold’s shield, the _shield_, or home, of Bold,\r\nas the eminence might be the _law_ of Bold or Bolt.\r\n\r\n_Dene_ is from the Celto-Saxon _den_, a deep, wooded valley; Anglo-Saxon\r\n_den_, _dene_, _denn_. The best specimen of this kind of valley in the\r\ncounty of Durham is probably Castle Eden Dene, a wooded, narrow valley\r\nnear the sea. Its name is interesting, and contains the ancient and\r\nmodern spelling. Its earliest name was evidently Eden, from _ea_ or _e_,\r\nwater, and _den_, a wooded valley; and this becoming a proper name, a\r\nsecond _den_ was added--namely, Eden Dene, which gives us\r\nwater-dene-dene. We have also in the north Hesleden, Deneholm, and\r\nHardwick Dene.\r\n\r\n_Burn_, _grain_, _broc_, are allied. The first of these may be said to\r\nbe as pure Weardale as Saxon. Whilst the Norse _beck_ crowds the banks\r\nof Teesdale, it does not exist in Weardale. _Burn_ spreads from this\r\ndale northward through Durham, Northumberland, and Scotland. _Beck_ is\r\nas foreign to Weardale as the Danish test-word _by_ and the Norwegian\r\n_thwaite_, though all the three names crowd around, close to the very\r\nhills on the south and west of the dale of the Wear. Within the bounds\r\nof Stanhope parish the Wear is fed by several tributary burns. These\r\nstreams receive or are formed at the head by _grains_, and the grains\r\nare fed by springs from the _brocks_. _Brock_ is from Anglo-Saxon\r\n_broc_, _brece_, to break forth--the place where the water first breaks\r\nthrough the earth--hence _brook_, literally water running through the\r\nearth. A _brock_ is a little hollow a few feet wide, formed by water\r\nbreaking through the ground, and washing out a miniature valley. The\r\nmoors of Weardale and surrounding district abound with these broken\r\nplaces, which are mostly known to shepherds and game-shooters. They\r\nexist on the top of the fells, where they are the only natural shelters.\r\nPlatey Brock, on Chapel Fell, receives its name from an exposed plate or\r\nshale bed. To show how numerous these places are, I will mention that on\r\nBurnhope Moor there are also Coldberry Brocks, Limestone Brocks,\r\nHighfield Brocks, Wester Langtayhead Brocks, Todsyke Brocks, Lodgegill\r\nBrocks, Scraith Head Brocks, Browngill Brock, Cocklake Brock,\r\nSally-Grain Brocks, Lang Brock. To the above may be added the\r\nbetter-known names of Black Brocks, or Moss Brocks, in Burnhope, and\r\nWelhope Brocks.\r\n\r\n_Grain_, Icelandic _grein_, is a division, a branch, as the grain of a\r\nfork; Danish _green_, a branch, a bough. Generally the branches at the\r\nhead of a burn are distinguished by north and south, and east and west\r\ngrains; and sometimes by name, as Sally Grain in Burnhope, and Jopla\r\nGrains in Bolihope. \"East Graine under Craggs\" is in Bolihope. At\r\nHarthope Head there are the east and west grains, which meet and form\r\nthe burn. In addition to the sixteen hopes previously mentioned, from\r\ntwelve of which flow the principal tributary burns to the Wear, there\r\nare some thirty secondary streams, named _burn_, Anglo-Saxon _burne_, a\r\n_bourn_, stream, brook, river, and which are distinguished by the names\r\nof the hope, or place, from which they flow, or from some other\r\ncharacteristic feature or condition.\r\n\r\nSowen Burn, near Stanhope, is a very characteristic specimen, the\r\nadjectival component being the Old English _sounen_, sound, the noisy\r\nburn, or, rather, the sounding burn.\r\n\r\nFine Burn, in Bolihope, is so named owing to the stream being a line of\r\nboundary. The words \"fine,\" \"confines,\" \"finish,\" \"finis,\" mark the end,\r\nand the above stream is the boundary between the parishes of Stanhope\r\nand Wolsingham. The Roman camp, _ad fines_ camps, is situated close to\r\nthe border-line between England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn Rookhope Smails Burn implies the small burns--Anglo-Saxon _smala_,\r\nsmall--two little runners rendered somewhat historic in the days of\r\nBorder broils, as we find in the old ballad of Rookhope Ryde. In the\r\nsame district we have Red Burn, and Over Red Burn. _Red_ is from\r\nAnglo-Saxon _read_, _rud_; Danish _röd_, red, the red stream; or the\r\nCeltic _rhyd_, a ford; whilst _over_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _ofer_, a\r\nshore, or _ofer_, over, above or higher--hence High Redburn.\r\n\r\nYeky Burn is from Anglo-Saxon _æc_, _eac_, oak, the stream of the oaks.\r\nThere are two Heathery Burns, one associated with the noted cave at\r\nStanhope. Old spelling hetherie, hetherye, hethery, from heath,\r\nAnglo-Saxon _hæth_, Scotch heather.\r\n\r\nThe name _well_ is given to a large number of tiny streams in Weardale.\r\nDutch _wellen_, Anglo-Saxon _wel_, a fountain of water, and in Saxon\r\nnames of places, _wel_, _wyl_, and _well_ often occur.\r\n\r\nKelhope and Welhope are literally the hopes out of which water _wells_.\r\nThe source of the latter is named Wellheads. At the head of smaller\r\nwells there are _springs_, places where water springs out--Anglo-Saxon\r\n_springan_--hence we have such names as Spring Wells, Whitewell Spring,\r\nWhite Wells, White Springs.\r\n\r\nLudwell is the people’s well, Anglo-Saxon _leod_, people. This water\r\nsprings out of a cave in the great limestone, where, in olden times, the\r\nWeardale folks might have congregated, for the Saxon prefix shows it to\r\nhave been the well of the people, like Ludlaw, the people’s hill,\r\nsuggesting the days of village communities, and the days of superstition\r\nwhen wells were in many cases held sacred. These were generally iron\r\nwells--locally, _haliwells_. There are many wells known as holywells in\r\nthis district, some of which are also termed _spa_-wells. This term is\r\nfrom the bath town, Spa, in Belgium, derived from _espa_.\r\n\r\nOf other wells proper, we might mention Sunderland Well, Hunterley Well,\r\nHuntshield Well, Black Dene Well, Carrbrow Well, Earnwell; Anglo-Saxon\r\n_earn_, _ern_, an eagle--the eagle’s well. Several names of places in\r\nEngland are from the eagle. Toft Well, east of Stanhope, is the well in\r\nthe toft or field, and the initial in Totley Well is probably from toft.\r\nBot’s Well, at Frosterley, is supposed to be that of St. Botolph, to\r\nwhich saint, the old chapel, close by the well, was dedicated. Poppet\r\nWell is a curious name, and is probably \"coppet,\" from _cop_, a head.\r\nThe adjectival component in Duntert Well is evidently the same as in\r\nDunter Linn, at Eastgate. Boutes Well is Bolts Well, as in Boltsburn.\r\nBerry Well is apparently the well of the mountain, Anglo-Saxon _beorg_,\r\n_beorh_, a hill, a mountain. At Newhouse there is a Bank Spring, and at\r\nWestgate a Spring Bank, indicating at each place a bank and a spring of\r\nwater. Cuthbert’s Spring, near Westgate, is in honour of the patron\r\nsaint of Durham, and it is no wonder that we find the name of St.\r\nCuthbert associated with names of places. On Harthope Moor, and close to\r\nthe road, is an excellent spring called Jenny’s Meggie, and at\r\nFrosterley a spring is called Meggie.\r\n\r\n_Cleugh_, _gill_, and _sike_ are associated with water. We have in the\r\nparish of Stanhope, in round numbers, 30 _cleughs_, 10 _gills_, and 70\r\n_sikes_. _Cleugh_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _clough_, a cleft down the\r\nside of a hill; Danish _kloft_; Norwegian _kliufa_, to split--a narrow\r\nravine more like a cleft in the hill than a water-worn valley. Yearn\r\nCleugh, written _earne_ in 1666, is the eagle’s haunt, or that of the\r\nfalcon, the latter being once reared in Weardale for the purpose of the\r\nBishop’s hunt.\r\n\r\nIn 1666 we find mention of Addercleugh, the adder being frequently found\r\nin Weardale. Whick Cleugh--in 1595 written Weekerclough--is probably\r\nfrom the Anglo-Saxon _wic_, a marsh, but more probably from _wice_, the\r\nmountain ash, or rowan-tree, well known in the dale, and also known as\r\nthe wich-elm.\r\n\r\n_Gill_ is from the Norse _gil_, a mountain chasm, a glen or fissure in\r\nthe hillside. For this name we are indebted to the Norwegians, who\r\npeopled the neighbouring county of Cumberland. The best-known places of\r\nthis class are Aller Gill, Lodge Gill, and Dry Gill, as being associated\r\nwith habitations and lead mines. The first is the _gill_ of the alders.\r\nIn Burnhope there is Lodge Gill, a well-known name owing to a once\r\nfamous lead-mine being there situated. The name very probably originated\r\nfrom some forest animal lodging there, as we find Lodge Field,\r\nAnglo-Saxon _logian_, to place, put, lodge--the field where probably\r\ndeer were lodged in the forest-hunting days of the princely Bishops of\r\nDurham.\r\n\r\nIn Burnhope, a lead-mine in 1666 was called Hesley Gill--the hazel gill.\r\nIn Witton Gill we may have a very important place-name, for here may be\r\nthe gill of the witness--the spot where the inhabitants met, similar to\r\nthe meetings held in primitive times at particular stones. Leo says: \"By\r\nthe names Wittan-ig, Wittan-mor, Wittan-mær, and Readan-stan, we are\r\ninformed of those national and provincial meetings for self-government\r\nwhich have always characterized our race.\" Anglo-Saxon _witan_, to know;\r\nIcelandic _vita_; German _wissen_, to know. The _Witena gemot_ Bosworth\r\nexplains as \"the assembly of the wise, the supreme council of the\r\nnation.\" Edred the Saxon King held a witan at Ginge, in the parish of\r\nWest Hendred, Berks, and there is a Witan Dyke at Worthe in Hants,\r\nwhilst in our valley there is the village of Witton-le-Wear. Mirke Gill\r\nin Bolihope is the dark gill from the Anglo-Saxon _myrc_, Icelandic\r\n_myrk_, dark. It is curious to notice how the Danish and Saxon _cleugh_,\r\nthe Norwegian _gill_, and the Anglo-Saxon _burn_, are intermixed in\r\nRogerley-Gill-Burn, Willowgreen-Burn-Gill, and Stock-Gill-Cleugh; but\r\nsuch are many names of places, for if the term _burn_ was not understood\r\nby a Norwegian settler, he would add his own term, _gill_; if this was\r\nnot sufficiently clear to a Saxon, _burn_ would be added to convey his\r\nown meaning of a mountain-stream, and in a similar manner the various\r\nraces of mankind have stratified and built one upon another the various\r\ncomponents of place-names which are ethnological and historical\r\nlandmarks too invaluable not to be closely investigated.\r\n\r\n_Sike_ or _syke_ is a very common local name. It is from Anglo-Saxon\r\n_sic_, _sich_, Icelandic _sikje_, Norse _siki_. Sullivan says a _sike_\r\nis the drainage of a marsh, and that all sikes were once marshes.\r\nNatural productions have given names to several sikes, as the marshy\r\nhollows were the homes of trees, grasses, and animals; hence we have\r\nRowantree Sike, where there is an excellent ironstone mine; Saugh Sike,\r\ntwo Aller Sikes, Rushy Sike, Bents Sike, Moss Sike, and Birk Sike. Where\r\nwe find trees we find birds, so we have Hawk Sike, Hawk Sikes near\r\nStanhope, and Snipe Sike. Todd Sike is where the fox haunted, and Goat\r\nSike wants no explanation. Chisholm Sike, Anglo-Saxon _ceosel_, _ceosl_,\r\ngravel, sand, the sike by the gravelly or sandy holm. In Teesdale there\r\nis a Whey Sike, in Burnhope a Whoe Sike, and in Ireshope a Hoe Sike. In\r\nMiddlehope there is Scar Sike, the sike of the rock. Anglo-Saxon _carr_,\r\nDanish _skær_, Swedish _skar_, a projecting or prominent rock, a\r\ncliff--as Scarborough, Scarthwaite, Scarcliff, and Scarsdale, written in\r\nDoomsday Book, Scarnesdele. At Middleton on the Tees there is a place\r\ncalled Skears, and _scarr_, _skarr_, _skire_, are forms found in\r\nplace-names. Whetstone Sike is where the whetstone sill is exposed.\r\n\r\nA _linn_ is a deep or still pool, from the Celtic _llyn_, water, a lake,\r\nflood; Anglo-Saxon _hlynna_, a brook. In the North of England, however,\r\na _linn_ is understood to be a cascade or cataract, evidently owing to\r\nthe waterfall being a more attractive feature in a river scene than the\r\nlinn or pool, which is always found at the bottom of a fall. In Scotland\r\na _lin_, _lyn_, is described as a cataract, and in a secondary sense the\r\npool below. In Ireland _lin_ is a pool; and the Icelandic form of the\r\nword is _lind_. The most attractive _linns_ in Weardale are Linnkirk, on\r\nShittlehope Burn, near Stanhope--a romantic spot where there is a tiny\r\nwaterfall and a cave close by in the great limestone; the Dunter Linn\r\nand Holm Linn at Eastgate; and the Linny--a waterfall on the Harthope\r\nBurn, near St. John’s Chapel. The Danish _dundre_ is to make a noise\r\nlike thunder, and the Scotch _dunder_ has the same meaning. The Saxon\r\nDonar is the god of thunder, hence Dunter Linn is that which makes a\r\ngreat noise.\r\n\r\n_Kern_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _cyrn_, _cyrin_, _cerene_; Danish\r\n_kjerne_, a churn; Icelandic _kirna_; Scottish _kirn_. The primary\r\nmeaning appears to be to turn, the act of turning, allied to quern, the\r\nancient mills for grinding corn. _Kern-holes_, found in the bed of\r\nrivers, are holes worn out by the churning motion of water mixed with\r\nsand. On Chapel Fell there is a watery hole called Jackson’s Kern, owing\r\nto one Jackson being accidentally drowned in it whilst coming from\r\nMiddleton; but this might be _cairn_, a heap of stones. In Burnhope\r\nBurn, at Six-dargue, a deep hole in the stream is called Kern Pool.\r\n\r\n_Pool_, Anglo-Saxon _pol_, Welsh _pwll_, Icelandic _pollr_. There are in\r\nthe Wear and its tributaries a large number of pools which have names.\r\nHolm Pool is the pool by the holm, and Wash Pool very probably was a\r\nplace where the good wives washed their linen in the days when\r\nspinning, weaving, and various other methods of manufacturing household\r\nrequisites were in full operation. Winn Pool, from the Anglo-Saxon\r\n_winn_, _gewin_, contest, struggle, to win--the pool where the meeting\r\nof the waters cause a fight, and struggle, as it were, to _win_.\r\n\r\nThe _eale_ and _ealand_ are our isle and island, and are the names given\r\nin Weardale to alluvial land on the margins of the main river. In the\r\nriver and place-names Gret_a_, _Ea_, _Ea_mont, Batters-_ea_,\r\nAldern-_ey_, Pont-_eland_, _ea_ or _a_ represents water or a river.\r\nBishop Egelwin, 1069, \"after having, with all his people, passed three\r\nmonths and some days at _Ealande_, returned to the church of Durham,\"\r\naccording to the Saxon writers. In the Boldon Buke we find in a charter\r\nof Bishop Flambard--“R. Biscop greteth well all his thanes and drenghs\r\nof _Ealand_scire and Norhamscire.\" In Wolsingham parish we find in\r\nHatfield’s Survey, Papworth-ell, Small-eys, and in the same record\r\nCatherine of the Ele is mentioned. The names of places containing the\r\nAnglo-Saxon root _ea_, in the parish of Stanhope, are about a dozen.\r\n\r\nIn 1380, according to Hatfield, the parson of Stanhope held the Frith,\r\nand a place _parcellum del Ele_, containing one acre. In 1608, in a list\r\nof lands held by the rector of Stanhope, we find \"one close called ‘The\r\nParson Ele.’\" A few hundreds of yards eastward, just below the Butts, we\r\nhave Bond Eale, a stretch of land subject to be flooded, and formerly\r\nheld by bond tenants, who had to perform services in connection with the\r\nland, such as thatching and carrying the running gear for Stanhope\r\ncorn-mill.\r\n\r\nThomas Morgan, by will dated 1641, left for charitable purposes amongst\r\nother lands: \"One parcel of arable ground in ye said Frosterley lying\r\nand being at ye west end of ye same town in a place there called Hudse\r\nEale, and one acre and a rood of ground lying and being in ye said\r\nFrosterley in a place called ye Mille Eale, and all other my lands and\r\ntenements with ye said appurtenances in Frosterley aforesad--Barnes\r\nEale--excepted.\"\r\n\r\nA mile and a half west of Eastgate we have, between Hunterley Well and\r\nParkhouse Pasture, the interesting Cammock Eale, locally called \"Cammo\r\nKeel,\" for the derivation of which we have the adjectival component from\r\nthe Celtic _cam_, crooked, and the ending _og_, diminutive, Celtic\r\n_ock_--hence the little crooked isle.\r\n\r\n_Holm_ is akin to ealand. Taylor says: \"The suffix in the name Durham is\r\nproperly not the Saxon _ham_, but the Norse _holm_; and Dunelm--the\r\nsignature of the Bishop--reminds us also that the Celtic prefix is\r\n_Dun_, a hill-fort, and not _Dur_, water. In the Saxon Chronicle the\r\nname is correctly written Dunholm.\" _Holm_ is also Anglo-Saxon, and is\r\ndescribed by Bosworth as \"a river island, a green plot of ground\r\nenvironed with water--hence holmes.\"\r\n\r\nHolmside, in the county of Durham, and Midge Holm, Holmwath, and Yallow\r\nHolm, are names of places by the river in Teesdale.\r\n\r\nBy the Wear, at the west end of Rogerley Park, is situated Burry Holm.\r\nIn the year 1583 Thomas Blacket, Esq., of Woodcroft, demised to Peter\r\nMaddison, gent., three closes of land being part of Woodcroft estate;\r\none close was on the west side of the low pasture, and another close of\r\nmeadow was called \"Buiri Holme.\" It might be the holm of the burdock\r\n(_Arctium Lappa_), or the berry holm from Anglo-Saxon _berie_, _berige_,\r\na berry, or the _bere_ holm or place where barley grew, Anglo-Saxon\r\n_bere_, barley. Again, the spear plume-thistle (_Cnicus lanceolatus_),\r\ncalled in Scotland the bur-thrissil, might flourish here, or the\r\nburtree, the common elder (_Sambucus nigra_).\r\n\r\nThe names _flask_, _swang_, _bog_, and _wass_, indicate wet land, and\r\nare kindred terms to a certain extent. Those accustomed to travel on the\r\nhighlands of Weardale will be familiar with lands denominated _boggy_,\r\n_swampy_, _swangy_, _marshy_. The term _wass_ may be considered\r\nobsolete, and that of _flask_ nearly so.\r\n\r\nIn Hatfield’s Survey there were in Bolihope lands called the Wasses and\r\nSeggefeldland. _Wass_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _wæs_, water, and _segg_\r\nfrom the Anglo-Saxon _segg_, _seeg_, a reed or sedge, which commonly\r\ngrows on wet land.\r\n\r\nA pasture in Killhope, between Low Moss and the Rush, was some thirty\r\nyears ago called the Flask. Langtay Flask is in Burnhope, and a\r\nlead-mine here was known by that name 200 years ago. In the bailiffs’\r\nroll under Queryndon, we find in Hatfield, lands called _fennes_,\r\n_flasskes_, and a place called Atthillswang. In Quesshowe there was le\r\n_Flaske_. At Framwelgate, Broom cum le _Flassh_, at Cotam les _flaskes_.\r\n\r\n_Bog_, Gaelic _bog_, Irish _bogach_, marsh, morass, quagmire, needs\r\nlittle explanation. Riggy Bogs, Boghouse, White Bog, and Bog Hole, are\r\namongst names of places in the dales.\r\n\r\n_Den_, from the Celto-Saxon, is a deep wooded valley, and has already\r\nbeen considered under valleys. The most important _denes_ are Easter\r\nBlack Dene and Wester Black Dene.\r\n\r\nHot Hill is no doubt the wooded hill, but Hotts has another derivation,\r\nand appears to be from _hut_, an abode or sheltered place. Another name,\r\n_hurst_, pure German, a thick wood, is confined, as far as Weardale is\r\nconcerned, to Shield Hurst.\r\n\r\nThe termination _shaw_, a thicket or small wood, is frequently met with\r\nin place-names. The Danish _skov_ is a wood or forest, Icelandic\r\n_skogr_; the Anglo-Saxon _scua_, _scuwa_ is a shade, the same as the\r\nSwedish _skugga_. Anglo-Saxon _sceaga_ seems to mean shaggy wood. In the\r\nHatfield’s Survey, a place in Bolihope is called Watteshawe--a wet\r\nwooded place. Near Allergill we have Birkshaw, the place shaded by\r\nbirch-trees. In Shittlehope there are two places on the expanding\r\nmoorlands called Bashaw and Mogshaw. The former was probably the badger\r\nshaw or wood. In the latter we have an important root, the Erse _magh_,\r\nWelsh _maes_, a plain. Taylor gives _magh_ as a Gadhelic test word, and\r\nsays that it is found in more than a hundred Irish names of places.\r\n\r\nThe various place-names embracing _mea_, _may_, are from the same root,\r\nand probably Migg Clos, held by the parson of Stanhope in 1380, is a\r\nkindred name. A place on the south side of Bolihope is named\r\nHarnshaw--written in 1614 _Hornyshawe_, and in 1666 _Harnshaw_--from\r\nAnglo-Saxon _hyrne_, _hirne_, an angle or corner, a resemblance to a\r\nhorn--hence the _hyrne_ shaw would be the horn-shaped wood. Ramshaw,\r\nparticularly known for its well, is evidently the ram wood, Anglo-Saxon\r\n_ram_, _ramm_, a ram; but some authorities derive _ram_ from _raven_.\r\nThese etymological conclusions give us a broad birch, a horn-shaped and\r\na wet wood, a wood on a plain, and a wood frequented by the ram and the\r\nbadger.\r\n\r\n_Wood_, Anglo-Saxon _wudu_, _wode_, woodland, enters into a few local\r\nnames, as Bradwode or Broadwood.\r\n\r\nIn Rookhope there is a Foul Wood, a lead-mine so named over two hundred\r\nyears ago. Its name is evidently from the Anglo-Saxon _ful_, rotten, the\r\nsame as Foul Sike was the impure watercourse. In 1401 Roger Thornton\r\nleased a lead-mine in Weardale at a place called Old Wode Clough.\r\n\r\nIn _field_, _ley_, and _ridding_, we have indications of clearings in\r\nthe forest--places where cattle might feed. In Weardale there are some\r\nthirty _leys_, numerous _fields_ but very few _riddings_. The latter\r\nword is from Anglo-Saxon _hreddan_, to rid; _hredding_ a ridding; Danish\r\n_rydde_, to clear, grub up; _rydning_, clearing. The Weardale people are\r\nfamiliar with _rid-up_, a house; _rid-out_, a quarry; and similar terms.\r\nIt is different from the _riding_, from Anglo-Saxon _thri_, _thry_,\r\nthree; _thridda_, the third; _thrithing_, a third part of a province, as\r\nin the Yorkshire Ridings. Five hundred years ago John Migg held at\r\nStanhope four acres of land in the _Ridding_, Robert Todd held _j\r\nRidding_ over an acre, and Alexander Brancepath held five acres and one\r\nrod in the _Riddying_. In Queen Elizabeth’s time Michael Fetherstonhalgh\r\nof Stanhope Hall purchased of Follinsby a parcel of ground called\r\nPathemairidding. In Path-mairidding we have the ridding on the plain\r\nover which there was a path.\r\n\r\n_Ley_, _lea_, _lee_, _lay_, is an open place, a pasture or field where\r\ncattle may lie; from the Anglo-Saxon _leah_, _leag_, _lege_, _lea_,\r\n_leah_; from _licgan_, _liggan_, to lie. The _lea_ was an opening or\r\nforest clearing where cattle might be depastured, but where a good deal\r\nof woodland might exist. Gray, in the opening lines of his beautiful\r\n\"Elegy,\" sings--\r\n\r\n    \"The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the _lea_.\"\r\n\r\nThis terminal occurs in over twenty names of places in Boldon Buke. In\r\nWeardale there are five names of places having this suffix which are\r\nvery important, as they give names to extensive stretches of land, and\r\nvery probably the adjectival components may all be derived from personal\r\nnames. These are Frosterley, Bishopley, Rogerley, Horsley, and\r\nBrotherlee.\r\n\r\nOn the hill north of Eastgate is situated Bewley, where once a cross\r\nexisted, and in former days a watch for invaders was kept here. This\r\nplace-name is probably more correctly Bewdley. In 1380 and 1590 it was\r\nwritten _Bowdlye_, and may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon _bige_,\r\n_biga_, _bigan_, a turning, corner, bending, angle, the ley, or field,\r\non the bend or bow of the hill, the bowed ley.\r\n\r\nAmongst the highest hills in Weardale are Fendrith Hill, Knoutberry\r\nHill, Noon Hill, St. Cuthbert’s Hill, and Horseshoe Hill. _Hill_, _hyl_,\r\n_hyll_, is Anglo-Saxon, Norse _holl_, a name given to large and small\r\nelevations. One of these hills is named after the patron saint of the\r\nBishopric of St. Cuthbert. Like Outberry Plain on the southern ridge,\r\nKnoutberry Hill on the north, evidently derived its name from the\r\ncloud-berry, _Rubus Chamæmorus_, which grows on the Weardale fells. In\r\n1614, however, it was written Nookhill. Fendrith was written in 1539\r\nFenrake. The word _rake_ is common in Weardale, and means to walk or\r\nrange, or the extent of the walk--hence a sheep-_rake_, Swedish _reka_,\r\nto travel, journey. A _fen_ is land covered with mud, a morass--hence\r\nthe Fenrake was the district covered by a large morass. The hill known\r\nas the Horseshoe might be so shaped, or the suffix may be _shaw_, a\r\nwood--the wood of Horsa.\r\n\r\nAmongst hills of lesser elevations than the five abovementioned are\r\nBilling Hills, where the Scots camped in 1327; Scaud Hill, in Burnhope,\r\nfrom the Anglo-Saxon _sceawian_, _scewian_, to look; Batable Hill,\r\ndebatable land; Scrog Hill, Anglo-Saxon _scrob_, _scrobb_, a shrub, the\r\nhill of shrubs; Dun Hill, Ancient British _dun_, a height or hill fort\r\n(Gaelic _dun_, as Dun Fell, in Teesdale). Dod Hill and Dodder Hill are\r\nmountains with rounded summits, as Dodd Fell, in the Lake District.\r\nCross Hill, in Stanhope, is where an ancient cross stood. We had a Paper\r\nHill and a Poperd Hill, which were the hills where the priests preached.\r\nWe have hills known or distinguished as _hard_, _long_, _windy_,\r\n_slate_, _black_, _green_, _white_, _gold_, _quarrel_ (quarry), _hungry_\r\n(poor), _stony_, _great_, _low_, etc. Animals contribute their names, as\r\nin Hog Hill, Lamb Hill, Plover Hill, Fairhills (Norse _faar_, sheep),\r\nand Cowshill, the hill where cows congregated.\r\n\r\n_Law_, Anglo-Saxon _hlaw_, _hlæw_, rising ground, an elevation, a hill.\r\nIn the south it is _low_, as Ludlow, the people’s hill. Killhope Law is\r\n2,206 feet above sea-level, Collier Law 1,692, Bolts Law 1,772, and Pow\r\nLaw and the Three Laws are the names of other hills in the district.\r\n\r\n_Seat_, Anglo-Saxon _set_, a sitting; _sæta_, settlers, inhabitants. The\r\nroot _sæte_, _set_, or _seta_, enters into several names of places in\r\nEngland, some of which are county towns, as Dorset, Somerset;\r\nOld Norse _setr_, a seat. The Norwegian _seter_ is a pasture or\r\nmountain-side--Burnhope Seat, Dora’s Seat, and Raven’s Seat. One was the\r\nsettlement of a person named Raven, or Rafn; the other that of Dora, or\r\nDore. In 1614 we find Dorry Sette. Bishop’s Seat was the place where the\r\nlords of the Bishopric settled when hunting in Weardale Forest. Another\r\nname is Laverock Seat, evidently Leofric’s Seat, modernized into\r\nLark-seat.\r\n\r\n_Head_, Anglo-Saxon _head_, _heafod_, a head. In a district full of\r\nundulating lands and small valleys there are several places deriving\r\ntheir names from being the top or head, or finished part of something,\r\nas Lanehead, Wearhead, Dalehead, Sidehead, Nag’s Head, Lamb’s Head, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n_Rig_, _rigg_, Anglo-Saxon _rig_, _hrycg_, and various other forms;\r\nDanish _ryg_; Icelandic _hriggr_, a ridge, a back. Stangend Rigg is\r\n2,075 feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\n_Plain_ and _pike_ are sufficiently expressive--the one a broad stretch\r\nof land, and the other a peak or pointed eminence. Five Pikes are near\r\nPaw Law Pike, a south-eastern boundary point on the hills. Ireshope\r\nPlains is a euphonious name; and Bewdley Plain, Sedling Plain, Outberry\r\nPlain, may be mentioned in the list.\r\n\r\n_Moor_, _fell_, _common_, are well-known terms. Anglo-Saxon _mor_ is\r\nwaste-land, a moor, a heath; Danish _mor_ is a moor, or morass; we have\r\nKillhope, Burnhope, and Wellhope Moors. _Fell_ is Old Norse. All the\r\nWeardale moorlands are called fells. Chapel Fell is 2,294 feet above\r\nsea-level; A _common_ is a tract of unenclosed pasture or outside land\r\non which the tenantry of the inlands have a common right, or right of\r\ncommon for their sheep.\r\n\r\n_Bank_, _band_, _brae_, and _brow_, are common in place-names, as Brook\r\nBank, Owsen Bands, Whitfield Brow, etc. _Batts_, low, flat ground near\r\nwater; Anglo-Saxon _bæth_, a bath, land subject to be soaked with water.\r\n_Berry_, as Knoutberry Hill, Bleaberry, and Snodberry, are from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _beorg_, _beorh_, a hill. _Cut_, _cove_, as Cove’s Houses;\r\n_crooks_, as Milncrook, Seggecrok, Crawcrook, are found. Also _end_, as\r\nHill End; and _edge_, as White Edge, Band Edge. _Flat_, _green_, and\r\n_ground_, are also found in several place-names, as Barnflat, Willow\r\nGreen, and Trodden Ground. In the Boldon Buke we have Pelhou, Quesshow,\r\nand Dunhow, from _haw_, Anglo-Saxon _hæge_, a hedge.\r\n\r\n_Haugh_ is a common name in Northumberland for low-lying grounds close\r\nto rivers. It is frequently met with on the Tyne, but it is not so\r\ncommon on the Wear. Worsaae returns _haugh_ in no other county than\r\nNorthumberland, to which he ascribes ten, the _haugh_, or _how_, being\r\ngiven as the Scandinavian _haugh_, a hill; but the _haugh_ of the\r\nBorderland is low-lying and sheltered meadow-land close to the winding\r\nrivers. In 1380, at Stanhope, there was a Castle Hogh, known as the\r\nCastle Haugh until within fifty years ago. There is a _haugh_ at Softly,\r\nand a _haughing-gate_ at Eastgate. There are various _haughs_ in and\r\nabout Blanchland, and it might appear that Weardale, where it is very\r\nrare, formed the southern boundary. But there are, however, three\r\n_haughs_ in the West Riding.\r\n\r\n_Hooks_, _height_, _hole_, and _howl_. We have Fairy Holes--caves in the\r\nlimestone--Foxholes, Brockholes, and Catholes, as names of places; Hole\r\nHouse, Clay Holes, and many others. Cuthbert Heights is from St.\r\nCuthbert. _Knot_, _loc_, _lake_, _land_, as the Knotts, the Locks,\r\nCocklake, and the Lands. _Mea_, Welsh _maes_, Erse _magh_--a plan--is\r\nvery common in the Durham dales. In Teesdale there is Flushy Mea, Sow\r\nMea; and, in Weardale, Broad Mea, Mea Sike, Pitty Mea, Rimea, and\r\nothers. _Mound_, moss, _nook_, _rake_, _pit_, and _pot_, occur in many\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n_Side_, a Saxon word, Icelandic _sida_, the edge, a hillside, enters\r\ninto a number of names of places, as Fell Side, Kirk Side, with\r\n_siders_, as Cuthbert Siders; and also _sedeing_, a sideling or sloping.\r\n_Slack_, _spot_, _wick_, _wham_, _clints_, _crag_, _carr_, _scar_, are\r\namongst other words forming place-names.\r\n\r\nHabitations and enclosures have their special names.\r\n\r\nWhen the Angles and Saxons arrived in our island they planted\r\nsettlements in fertile districts. By the margins of some meandering\r\nriver, which had already been named by the earlier Celtic race, the\r\nSaxon families located themselves and established homes, many of which\r\nare now large towns. The forest growth was cleared, and, with that love\r\nof home characteristic of the Saxons, a portion of the cleared land was\r\nenclosed, guarded, or protected, with the _tines_ of forest growth--the\r\ntines or twigs of the wood; hence _tun_ occurs in 137 Anglo-Saxon names\r\nof places in the 1,200 taken from Kemble’s Charters. This termination\r\nbecame to mean, not the tines or twigs alone, nor yet the hedges of\r\nwhich they were made, but the whole enclosure or estate was the _tun_ or\r\n_ton_ of some person; or the _ton_ otherwise distinguished, as Stockton,\r\nthe stockaded town; Middleton, the middle town; Willington, the town of\r\nthe family of Willing--sons of Will. Other terminations indicate Saxon\r\nhomes, as _ham_, _worth_, _stoke_, _stow_, _fold_, _bury_. In the Boldon\r\nBuke we find the Danish _toft_; and the universal description of small\r\nholdings in Hatfield’s Survey is a _toft_ and a _croft_. We also find in\r\nprimitive days the villagers holding _dales_ of land--land divided into\r\nlong, narrow strips or divisions, each villager knowing his own strip.\r\nWhen Weardale was more under cultivation, it was customary for the\r\ninhabitants to _take in_ land from the moors; hence we find the\r\nplace-name _intake_, locally _intak_. And at a later period still, when\r\nActs of Parliament dealt with the division of moorlands, we got the name\r\n_allotment_, abbreviated to _lotment_ and _lot_--the allotted land.\r\n\r\n_Acre_ is mentioned, as in Farnacres, in the Boldon Buke; and in later\r\nsurveys are Longacre and Etheredacres. _Barn_, _berry_, _beeld_, _byre_,\r\nand _by_, _bower_, _cave_, _castle_, _chesters_, _close_, _croft_,\r\n_dale_, and _darg_--as six darg, from Anglo-Saxon _dæg-weorc_, day’s\r\nwork. _Fold_, _farm_, _faw_, _frith_, _gate_, _garth_, _hot_, _ing_,\r\n_ham_, _kirk_, _lodge_, _park_, _meadow_, _pry_, _shield_, _stead_,\r\n_ton_, and _wall_, are common in the dales of the county of Durham.\r\n\r\nAmongst the names referring to buildings we have _cross_, as Killhope\r\nCross and Edmundbyres Cross. Stone crosses to guide the wayfarer were\r\nonce erected at these places. _Brig_ is from bridge, whether built of\r\nstone or wood. _Currock_, a pile of stones erected on the moors or fells\r\nas a landmark. _Peth_ and _lonnon_ and _way_ are also common names. And\r\nall these have their adjectival component, as Lodge Field, Leases Park,\r\nMill Houses, Pry Hill, Old Faw, Shield Ash, Watch Currock, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDURHAM CATHEDRAL\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. WILLIAM GREENWELL, M.A., D.C.L., F.R.S., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 875 the great Scandinavian invasions were assuming large\r\nproportions, and among other parts of England where the Danes landed and\r\nharried the country was the coast of Northumbria. The monks fled from\r\nLindisfarne, which had been selected by Aidan principally because of its\r\nresemblance to Iona. There was probably another reason for the choice:\r\nits neighbourhood to the stronghold of Bamborough, the seat of the\r\nNorthumbrian Kings. Lindisfarne is very near to it, and naturally would\r\nbe under the protection of the King who lived there.\r\n\r\nBamborough, however, proved no protection against the Danes, who came\r\noversea, and, landing on the coast, overran not only a great part of the\r\nNorth of England, but also a considerable portion of the South of\r\nScotland. The monks, fearing lest they should be deprived of St.\r\nCuthbert’s body and their other treasures, and of their lives as well,\r\nfled from Lindisfarne, carrying with them the body of the saint. Many\r\nchurches dedicated to St. Cuthbert in these parts probably mark the\r\nspots where the monks in their journeying rested for a while.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering from 875 to 883, having remained for a short time at\r\nCrayke, they settled at Chester-le-Street, which was given to them by\r\nGuthred, a Danish King then reigning in Northumbria, and who had become\r\na Christian.\r\n\r\nThere the body rested, and from it the Bernician See was ruled until the\r\nremoval of Bishop Aldhun and the congregation of St. Cuthbert (after a\r\nshort sojourn at Ripon) to Durham in 995. The difficulties of an\r\nadequate defence probably proved to the monks that Chester-le-Street was\r\nnot a suitable place for their protection. The superior position of\r\nDurham was no doubt the reason why it was selected for the site of the\r\nsee. This, then, was the commencement of the church and city of Durham.\r\n\r\nIn 999 Bishop Aldhun, having commenced it three years before, completed\r\nthe building of a stone church, to which the body of St. Cuthbert was\r\ntransferred from a wooden building (_æcclesiola_, Symeon calls it),\r\nwhere it had been at first placed. Of that church no part remains\r\nvisible to the eye, though there are no doubt thousands of the stones\r\nbelonging to it enclosed within the walls of the present church.\r\n\r\nThe first building remained until after the Norman Conquest, a great\r\nchange having taken place in the meantime. The monks who, with the\r\nBishop, had originally constituted the congregation of St. Cuthbert, had\r\nfallen from the rule which was first observed. There was in those days a\r\ngreat tendency among the regular clergy in the Saxon Church to\r\ndegenerate into a kind of secular clergy. Symeon says those at Durham\r\nwere neither monks nor regular canons. At Durham, as at Hexham, some\r\nmembers of the congregation were married and had families, and there was\r\nspringing up at Durham possibly, as there certainly was at Hexham, an\r\nhereditary system, son succeeding father; and had the system gone on,\r\nthere would have arisen a sacerdotal caste, with all the evils attending\r\nsuch a body. The Norman Conquest happily did away with that, as it did\r\nwith other abuses. It is probable that some remains connected with these\r\nmarried members of the congregation were discovered in 1874, when the\r\nfoundations of the east end of the old chapter-house, which was so\r\nruthlessly destroyed in 1796, were laid bare. The graves of Bishops\r\nRanulph Flambard, Galfrid Rufus, and William de St. Barbara were met\r\nwith, each covered with a slab bearing his name--probably not quite\r\ncontemporary--and in them were found three episcopal rings of gold, set\r\nwith sapphires, and in the grave of Flambard, the head, made of iron,\r\nplated with silver, and the iron ferrule of a pastoral staff, all of\r\nwhich are now preserved in the cathedral library. Below the level of the\r\nBishops’ graves there were found a considerable number of skeletons of\r\nmen, women, and children, with one of which was deposited the iron head\r\nof a spear, having the socket plated with gold. There can be little\r\ndoubt that these bodies belonged to the married portion of the\r\ncongregation and their families, who occupied the monastery at Durham\r\nfrom the time of Aldhun to their being dispossessed by Bishop William of\r\nSt. Carileph.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the congregation of St. Cuthbert, but\r\nof that body some further account must be given. The religious\r\ncommunity, the congregation of St. Cuthbert, which ultimately settled at\r\nDurham, included the Bishop and the monks. The two formed one body,\r\nwhose interests were identical, and whose property was in common; and\r\nthe Bishop lived among the monks, over whom he ruled within the\r\ncommunity as he ruled over the diocese without, having no estates or\r\nmeans of subsistence separate from the congregation of which he formed a\r\npart. This unity between the Bishop and the monks was very similar to\r\nthat which prevailed amongst the early religious communities in Ireland\r\nand Scotland. The system went on at Durham until the establishment of\r\nthe Benedictine Order there by Bishop William of St. Carileph, shortly\r\nafter the Norman Conquest. He was the second Bishop appointed by William\r\nI., Walcher, the first Norman Bishop, having been killed, after a short\r\nreign, by his own people at Gateshead, during a rebellion caused by the\r\noppression of his officials. William of St. Carileph, Abbot of St.\r\nVincent, became Bishop in 1081. Originally a secular priest, he\r\nafterwards became a monk in the monastery of St. Calais, and such an\r\nestablishment as that he found at Durham must have been most distasteful\r\nto him. A Benedictine monk himself, he naturally preferred being\r\nsurrounded by religious of his own Order, and not by those of whose\r\nsystem he disapproved. In the time of Bishop Walcher the ancient\r\nmonasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth were to a great extent, though\r\nprobably not altogether, deserted, and had been so since they were laid\r\nwaste by the Danes. When Bishop William determined upon establishing\r\nBenedictine monks at Durham, he found these two monasteries already\r\nexisting at Jarrow and Wearmouth. Thinking there were not sufficient\r\nprovision for the maintenance of more than one monastery, he transferred\r\nthe monks from Jarrow and Wearmouth to Durham in 1083, and founded a\r\nBenedictine house there. He became a party to the rebellion against\r\nWilliam Rufus in 1088, and was driven an exile for three years into\r\nNormandy. It may well be that during his sojourn there he conceived the\r\ndesign of replacing the old church by a new and more magnificent one.\r\nNormandy at that time was full of large and noble churches, many lately\r\nerected, and we can readily understand how the thought may have passed\r\nacross the mind of Carileph that, if he ever returned to Durham, he\r\nwould raise there a more glorious building, and one better adapted to\r\nthe wants of the new community than the church he had left behind him.\r\nAt all events, on his return, he determined to build a new church, and\r\nmay we not suppose that gratitude was among the motives which induced\r\nhim to do this? In the meanwhile, during the time of his exile, as we\r\nlearn from Symeon, the monks had built the refectory as, says he, it now\r\nstands. Symeon was living in the early part of the twelfth century; he\r\ntherefore speaks with authority. The crypt under the refectory, which\r\nstill exists, cannot be later than Symeon’s time, and must therefore be\r\npart of the refectory built during Carileph’s exile (1088-1091), and is\r\ntherefore in either case one of the earliest buildings at Durham in\r\nconnection with the monastery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_W LEIGHTON\r\n1909_\r\n\r\nTHE CRYPT, DURHAM CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nThis very ancient structure lies on the south side of the cloister, and\r\nto the west of a contemporary passage leading from it into the great\r\nenclosure of the monastery, now called the college. The passage itself\r\nhas an arcade of low blind arches on either side, and openings, possibly\r\ncoeval with it, lead into the crypt under the refectory at one side,\r\nand into a smaller one on the other. The refectory crypt is low, being\r\nonly seven and a half feet high, and commences at the east end with a\r\ndivision, which has a plain, barrel-shaped vault. From this an arched\r\nopening leads into the main area of the crypt. It is divided into three\r\naisles by two rows of short, massive square pillars, four in each row,\r\nmaking five bays in the length. The pillars support a plain groined\r\nvault without ribs or transverse arches. This space is again succeeded\r\ntowards the west by three divisions, the westernmost one being not so\r\nlong as the others, all the three having, like the first and easternmost\r\none, plain barrel vaults. Up to this point the whole crypt is of the\r\nsame early date, but beyond, to the west of what appears to be an\r\noriginal wall, are some other structures, the cellar and pantry, of\r\nlater times. The older crypt has been lighted on the south side by at\r\nleast seven, or possibly more, small windows, all round-headed except\r\none, which is circular.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the passage there is, as has already been stated, a\r\nsmaller crypt, which in general corresponds with the architectural\r\ncharacter of that under the refectory. It is now beneath the\r\nentrance-hall of the deanery, once part of the Prior’s hall, and has\r\napparently been curtailed of some of its original length.\r\n\r\nSymeon, a monk of Durham, already mentioned, lived when a great part of\r\nthe work at the church was going on, and therefore his testimony is very\r\nimportant. He wrote a history of the church of Durham, and his history\r\nwas continued after him by an anonymous writer. We next have a further\r\ncontinuation by Geoffrey de Coldingham, Robert de Graystanes, and\r\nWilliam de Chambre, together with a number of indulgences from various\r\nBishops, given towards obtaining means for making additions to and\r\nalterations in the building, and a few, but late, fabric rolls. Besides\r\nthese there is a most important document, \"A Description or Brief\r\nDeclaration of all the Ancient Monuments, Rites, and Customs belonging\r\nor being within the Monastical Church of Durham before the Suppression,\"\r\napparently written towards the end of the sixteenth century by someone\r\nwho had been an inmate of the monastery. These form the series of\r\nhistorical evidences which now exist with regard to the dates of the\r\nvarious parts of the church.\r\n\r\nIn 1093, on August 11, the foundation-stones of the new church were\r\nlaid, the foundations themselves having been dug on the preceding July\r\n29. Aldhun’s church, as Symeon tells us, had been previously destroyed.\r\nThere were then present Bishop William of St. Carileph; Turgot, Prior of\r\nthe monastery, afterwards Bishop at St. Andrews; and, as other writers\r\nsay, Malcolm, King of Scotland. The continuator of Symeon says that, on\r\nthe accession of Flambard, he found the church finished as far as the\r\nnave. This statement does not, of course, imply that the whole of this\r\nwas the work of Carileph, for the monks after his death had carried on\r\nthe building of the church; but it appears on the whole probable that,\r\nwith the exception of the west side of the transepts and the vaulting of\r\nthe choir, all the church up to the point mentioned had been built\r\nbefore the death of Carileph.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to give here a general description of the Norman work,\r\ntaking the nave first, as being the most important feature in the whole\r\ngreat scheme. The nave consists of three double compartments, a single\r\nbay westward of these, and the western bay flanked by the towers. The\r\nprincipal piers consist of triple shafts, placed on each face of a\r\ncentral mass, square in plan; the shafts rest on massive bases of\r\ncruciform plan, having a flat projecting band about the middle and a\r\nnarrow plinth at the bottom. A similar band and plinth are carried\r\nbeneath the wall-arcades of the nave and transepts and entirely round\r\nthe church on the outside. In the choir, however, except on the piers of\r\nthe tower arch, the bases are without a band, but have a plinth of\r\ngreater height, the responds on the aisle walls being similar. The\r\ntriple shafts next the nave or choir rise almost to the top of the\r\ntriforium, and support the great transverse arches of the vault. The\r\nshafts next the aisles receive the diagonal and transverse ribs of the\r\naisle vault, and the shafts on the two remaining faces receive the\r\narches of the great arcade. The intermediate piers, in the centre of\r\neach double compartment, are circular in plan, and stand on square\r\nbases. The western pair of piers, at the corners of the towers, are\r\nclustered like the other main piers, but have two additional shafts\r\n(like the crossing piers), but these shafts on the side next the nave\r\nreceive the diagonal ribs of the vault, whereas the additional shafts on\r\nthe crossing piers support the outer order of the tower arches.\r\n\r\nThe triforium is of eight bays, having a containing arch with two\r\nsub-arches, the tympanum being solid. The clerestory has in each of its\r\neight bays a lofty and wide arch with a smaller and lower one on each\r\nside, the central arch having a window fronting it. It has a wall\r\npassage which connects it with the clerestories on the west side of the\r\ntransepts. The inner arcade in the eastern bays appears to be an\r\ninsertion, possibly made when the vault was put on the nave. The idea of\r\nvaulting the nave was apparently abandoned, when the triforium stage was\r\nreached, and it is probable that the arrangement of the nave clerestory\r\nwas at first not unlike that of the south transept. The resumption of\r\nthe vaulting idea thus necessitated an alteration in the design of the\r\nclerestory.\r\n\r\nThe nave is covered a double quadripartite vault over each double\r\ncompartment, without transverse ribs over the minor piers. The great\r\ntransverse arches, which spring from the major piers, are pointed. The\r\ndiagonal ribs, which rise from corbels inserted in the spandrils of the\r\ntriforium arches, are semicircular. They are all decorated with zigzag.\r\n\r\nThe choir consists of two double compartments, and in its plan as a\r\nwhole agrees with that of the nave. There are, however, some differences\r\nin the details. The piers of the great arcades, although similar in\r\nmotive to those of the nave, are much longer from east to west, and are,\r\nin fact, more like sections of wall than piers. The clerestory is quite\r\nunlike that of the nave, having a plain round-headed arch in each bay,\r\nwith a corresponding window, and is destitute of a wall passage. The\r\ntriforiums on both sides of the choir and on the east side of the\r\ntransepts are all very similar. They are lighted by windows, consisting\r\nof two small round-headed openings, about twenty inches apart, under a\r\ncontaining arch. The buttressing arches, which are opposite the piers,\r\nare semicircular in form, and are contemporaneous with the arcades. Each\r\ntransept has two double bays, with an aisle on the east side. The vault\r\non the north transept has one transverse arch, which is semicircular,\r\nthe double bay to the north having a single quadripartite vault with\r\nsegmental diagonal ribs. All the ribs are moulded with a roll between\r\ntwo hollows. The south transept has a similarly formed vault, but the\r\nribs are enriched with zigzag. The triforium and other upper parts of\r\nthe church are reached by staircases contained in two square internal\r\nprojections which are in the north-west and south-west angles of the\r\ntransept. The end walls of the transepts were probably lighted by three\r\ntiers of windows; the lowest--which still remains--though blocked up, in\r\nthe south transept, is a single round-headed window. It is difficult to\r\nsay what was the arrangement above, but probably there were three\r\nwindows on the triforium level and one on that of the clerestory.\r\nPassages crossed the ends at these levels, but none now remain in their\r\noriginal state.\r\n\r\nThe vaults of the aisles of the choir, transepts, and nave, are\r\nquadripartite and are the same throughout, except that the diagonal ribs\r\nof the nave aisles beyond the two eastern bays have zigzag upon them.\r\n\r\nThe transverse ribs, which rise alike from both piers and columns, are\r\ncomposed of a flat soffit, with a roll and shallow on each edge, the\r\ndiagonal ribs having a large roll between two hollows. The first\r\ncompartment of the nave arcade, which comprises two bays and the east\r\nbay of the triforium arcade, correspond in their mouldings and other\r\nfeatures with those of the choir, whereas in the remainder of the nave,\r\nalthough the elevation in its general design and principal features is\r\nthe same, the mouldings in some essential particulars, especially in the\r\nuse of the zigzag and the course of small sunk squares forming a quasi\r\nhood-moulding round the arches of the great arcade, differ from those of\r\nthe choir. There is a difference also in the way in which the diagonal\r\nribs of the main vault was carried. In the choir the diagonal ribs of\r\nthe original Norman vault are supported on shafts, which still remain\r\nand rise from the level of the triforium floor; on the east side of the\r\ntransept they are supported by similar shafts; in the nave they are\r\nsupported on brackets formed of two grotesque heads, inserted in the\r\nspandrils between the containing arches of the triforium. The eastern\r\ncompartment of the nave arcade, with the triforium arch above it, which,\r\nbefore the nave was completed, acted as an abutment to the tower arches\r\non the west side, as the similar and corresponding arches of the\r\ntransepts did on the north and south, must necessarily have been built\r\nat the same time as the tower arches themselves, and, therefore,\r\nnaturally corresponds with them in the details.\r\n\r\nThe spiral grooving on the piers, a rare feature in Norman work, is seen\r\nin the choir and transepts, but not in the nave, where lozenge and\r\nzigzag patterns and flutings are used instead. The spirals are contrary\r\nto the ordinary direction of those on a screw. The eastern part of\r\nCarileph’s church no longer exists, having been replaced by a very\r\nbeautiful eastern transept. Until some important excavations were made\r\nin 1895, it was generally believed that the choir ended in an apsidal\r\ntermination, with an extension of the aisles forming an ambulatory\r\nround it. The foundations of the east end of the aisles, as well as of\r\nthe choir, together with a small portion of the choir wall itself, were\r\nthen discovered. From what remained it was shown that Carileph’s choir\r\nterminated in three apses, the central one, which extended 27 feet\r\nbeyond the others, being semicircular on the outside as well as within,\r\nwhile those at the end of the aisles had been semicircular only on the\r\ninside, being finished square externally.\r\n\r\nTo Galfrid Rufus may be attributed the present great north and south\r\ndoorways of the nave, themselves, however, replacing earlier ones. The\r\nsculpturing upon these doorways, and that upon the corbels which once\r\nsupported the ribs at the east end of the chapter-house, have apparently\r\nbeen done by the same hand, and there is otherwise much in common\r\nbetween the decoration of these doorways and that of the chapter-house\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSkilfully wrought and probably contemporary ironwork covers the south\r\ndoor, still remaining in a very perfect state.\r\n\r\nOn the north door there are sufficient indications to show what was the\r\npattern of the ironwork once there, and, indeed, with care and under a\r\nfavourable light, the very elaborate design may be made out. The\r\ngrotesque but effective sanctuary knocker of bronze, of the same date as\r\nthe door itself, if it does not invite the unfortunate offender to seek\r\nfor that protection now, happily, under more humane conditions, not\r\nneeded for his safety, will recall to memory how the Church in a ruder\r\nage held out her saving hand, and interposed between the shedder of\r\nblood, sometimes guiltless, and the avenger.\r\n\r\nThe death of Bishop Carileph took place in 1096, and an interval of\r\nthree years elapsed before the election of Bishop Flambard, in 1099, who\r\nis described as great by some, and infamous by other, writers.\r\n\r\nRalph Flambard was William Rufus’s Chancellor, and whether he was\r\ninfamous or not, he was, anyhow, a remarkable man. We are told by the\r\ncontinuator of Symeon, that he carried on the work of the nave up to the\r\nroof--that is, that he completed the nave as far as the vault, including\r\nthe side aisles and their vaults, and probably at the same time building\r\nthat portion of the western towers which attains an equal elevation with\r\nthe walls of the nave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SANCTUARY KNOCKER, DURHAM CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nFlambard probably began to build soon after he became Bishop, and though\r\nthat part of the church which is due to him might not have been finished\r\nuntil near the time of his death, no material alteration seems to have\r\nbeen made in the plan. With regard to the upper part of the western\r\ntowers, and the time when they were built, we are entirely left to the\r\nevidence of the architecture itself, for nothing has been recorded which\r\nhas reference to their erection. The upper stages belong to a time when\r\nthe style called the Early English was being developed, and they may\r\nhave been constructed during the episcopate of Richard de Marisco\r\n(1217-26), or even of Philip de Pictavia (1197-1208). Although the\r\ntowers have suffered much from weathering, and more from the paring\r\nprocess, which, however, to some extent, has been remedied by the late\r\nreparation, they are well designed and very effective additions to the\r\nchurch as originally planned. In combination with the end of the nave\r\nand the bold mouldings of Pudsey’s Galilee, they form a termination\r\nwhich will not suffer even when compared with some of our finest west\r\nfronts. The upper part of both is enriched by four arcades, two open and\r\ntwo blank, of alternately round-headed and pointed arches. The towers\r\nwere, until the time of the Commonwealth, surmounted by spires of wood\r\ncovered with lead. At present they are finished by a parapet with\r\nturrets, placed there at the beginning of the present century, which,\r\nthough faulty in detail, are, nevertheless, by no means unworthy of the\r\ntowers they crown, and add materially to the picturesque outline of the\r\ncathedral when viewed from a distance.\r\n\r\nBishop Cosin, in his articles of inquiry at his first visitation in\r\n1662, asks: \"What is become of the wood and lead of the two great\r\nbroaches that stood upon the square towers at the west end of the\r\nchurch?\" (_Miscellanea_, Surtees Society, vol. xxxvii., p. 257). This\r\ninquiry was repeated in Cosin’s second visitation, July 17, 1665, and\r\nthe reply made in the presentment of the minor canons, etc., was as\r\nfollows: \"And as for the lead and timber of the two great broaches at\r\nthe west end of the church, Mr. Gilbert Marshall can give the best\r\naccount how they were employed\" (Hunter MSS., vol. xi., No. 94). To\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WESTERN TOWERS OF DURHAM CATHEDRAL, FROM THE WINDOW\r\nOF THE MONKS’ LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n_From a Drawing by R. W. Billings._]\r\n\r\nthis reply James Green, minor canon and sacrist, adds: \"Mr. Gilbert\r\nMarshall, Mr. Gilpin, and Mr. Anthony Smith, can best tell what became\r\nof it\" (Hunter MSS., vol. xi., No. 98). Bishop Cosin would remember them\r\nas being on the towers when he was Prebendary before the time of the\r\nCommonwealth. That they were never rebuilt is shown by Buck’s view,\r\npublished in 1732, where the towers are without spires.\r\n\r\nThe most important, as it is not the least striking and beautiful,\r\nobject in the choir is the large and lofty throne, built by Bishop\r\nThomas de Hatfield (1345-81) during his lifetime, for his tomb beneath\r\nand the throne above. It is a structure worthy of the Palatine See of\r\nDurham and of the mighty Prince-Bishop who erected it. The alabaster\r\nfigure of the Bishop still remains, comparatively perfect, clothed in\r\nrichly decorated pontifical vestments, lying on an altar-tomb under a\r\ncanopy whose groining is finely ornamented with bosses of boldly\r\nsculptured foliage. Upon the wall at each end of the arch, and opposite\r\nto the head and feet of the Bishop, are two angels painted in fresco.\r\nThose at the feet hold a blank shield, but at the other end the painting\r\nis too much damaged to allow the object they hold to be made out. The\r\nwhole throne has once been richly gilded and coloured, and contains many\r\nshields with the Bishop’s and other arms upon them. In the construction\r\nof the upper portion of the throne it is not well fitted into the space\r\nit occupies between the pillars, and some of its parts do not quite\r\ncorrespond with each other. The impression given by these incongruities\r\nis that Hatfield used some pieces of stonework already carved before he\r\nplanned the throne, and that it possibly was, like the Galilee, not\r\nintended from the first to occupy the position in which it was\r\nultimately placed.\r\n\r\nAnother beautiful piece of work of about the same period as the throne\r\nis the screen behind the high-altar, commenced to be built in 1372 and\r\nfinished before 1380, when the altar was dedicated. It is commonly\r\ncalled the Neville Screen, on account of a great part of the expense of\r\nerecting it having been defrayed by John, Lord Neville, of Raby, though\r\nPrior Fossor (1341-74), Prior Berrington (1374-91), and others, bore\r\nsome part of the cost. It was brought from London to Newcastle by sea,\r\nand has always been spoken of as made of Caen stone, \"French peere\" as\r\nit is called in the rites of Durham, being really Dorsetshire clunch.\r\n\r\nSt. Cuthbert is said to have had a more than usual monastic dislike to\r\nwomen--though some of his most intimate friends were women--and\r\ntherefore to have built the Lady Chapel at the east end of the choir,\r\nthe ordinary position, which was close to his shrine, would have been\r\nmost distasteful to him. No woman, indeed, was allowed to approach\r\nfarther eastward in the church than as far as a line of dark-coloured\r\nFrosterley marble, forming a cross with two short limbs at the centre,\r\nwhich stretches across the nave between the piers, just west of the\r\nnorth and south doors. The Chapel of the Blessed Virgin,[9] commonly\r\ncalled the Galilee, was therefore placed where we now see it. It rises\r\nalmost directly from the edge of the river-bank, and is built against\r\nthe west front of the church. It is of an oblong form, of five aisles\r\ndivided by four arcades, each of four bays, the aisles being all of the\r\nsame width. The middle aisle is higher than those adjoining, and these\r\nagain are higher than the extreme north and south ones. The arches,\r\nrichly decorated with zigzag, are supported upon columns, originally\r\ncomposed of two slender shafts of Purbeck marble, but now of four\r\nshafts, alternately of marble and sandstone, the latter, added by\r\nCardinal Langley when he repaired the Galilee in which he placed his\r\ntomb in front of the altar, having capitals of plain volutes, which are\r\nvery characteristic of the Transitional period. The chapel was entered\r\nfrom without through a doorway on the north side, which has been\r\nrestored, the old one, however, having been exactly copied to the\r\nminutest parts. The doorway is deeply recessed, the wall being increased\r\nin thickness on both sides in the manner usual at that time, and is a\r\nfine example of the style in use when it was erected. Access to the\r\nchurch from the Galilee was also obtained through the great west door,\r\nwhich was probably not blocked up until Bishop Langley placed the altar\r\nof the Blessed Virgin there, and made two doors, one at the north and\r\nthe other at the south end of the west wall. The chapel was at first\r\nlighted by eight round-headed windows, placed high in the wall above the\r\narches of the outer arcade on the north and south sides, and no doubt\r\nhad other windows at the west end. The three windows in the north wall\r\nand the four in the south, originally inserted about the close of the\r\nthirteenth century, when the walls were raised in height, have all been\r\nrenewed, so far as the mullions and tracery are concerned. It is\r\nprobable that at the same time five similar windows were placed in the\r\nwest wall, of which only two are now left, the others having given place\r\nto three fifteenth-century windows. At the time when these important\r\nalterations were made, the original windows in the wall above the arches\r\nwere probably blocked up. Their outline, however, is still to be traced\r\nquite distinctly.\r\n\r\nIt must not be overlooked that the shrine containing the bones of the\r\nVenerable Bede were ultimately placed in the Galilee in 1370, in front\r\nof his altar. The bones are now placed in a plain tomb, having upon it\r\nthe well-known inscription, which, however, was only engraved on the\r\ncovering slab in 1830:\r\n\r\n    HAC SUNT IN FOSSA BEDÆ VENERABILIS OSSA.\r\n\r\nThere are some beautiful and well-preserved fresco paintings on the east\r\nwall at its north end. They are contemporary with the building, and\r\ncomprise a King and Bishop, probably St. Oswald and St. Cuthbert, and\r\nsome tasteful decoration of conventional leaf forms, very\r\ncharacteristic of the art of the period. The lower part of the back of\r\nthe recess, on the sides of which the figures occur, is filled with a\r\nrepresentation of hangings, the middle of which is now defaced, but\r\nwhere, before the Dissolution, was a picture of our Lady with the dead\r\nChrist. It is not impossible that the principal altar of the Blessed\r\nVirgin originally stood there, and was transferred by Cardinal Langley\r\nto the position it afterwards occupied when he probably built up the\r\ngreat western doorway of the church. The site in question was, up to the\r\ntime of the Reformation, devoted to the altar of Our Lady of Pity, or\r\nPiety, which may have been removed thither by Langley from the recess to\r\nthe north of it, which is surmounted by an arch with the dentel moulding\r\nof a date apparently not later than the commencement of the thirteenth\r\ncentury--a removal necessitated by his making there one of the two new\r\ndoorways into the Galilee. These paintings are not only of great\r\ninterest in themselves, but they possess a further one of being the only\r\nspecimens of fresco decoration in the cathedral which are now anything\r\nmore than mere fragments. The arches and capitals in the Galilee have\r\nalso been enriched by colour, among the designs being a zigzag and\r\nspiral pattern. It does not appear that this kind of decoration had ever\r\nbeen used to any great extent throughout the church, for very few\r\nremains of it were discovered when the modern whitewash was lately\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nIn the aisle, however, of the north transept, where the altars of St.\r\nBenedict and St. Gregory and that of St. Nicholas and St. Giles once\r\nstood, there are some portions of the pictures which adorned the wall\r\nbehind them, including, in connection with St. Gregory’s altar, the\r\nupper part of a figure vested with the pallium. There are also some\r\nscanty remnants of colour left behind the altars of Our Lady of Houghall\r\nand Our Lady of Bolton in the aisle of the south transept. The site of\r\nthe Neville Chantry in the south aisle of the nave still contains\r\nsufficient remains of the delicate and tasteful pattern to enable one\r\nto judge what the design has been, and slight traces of colour are to be\r\nfound upon the arches of the arcade behind the altars in the Chapel of\r\nthe Nine Altars. It is probable, indeed, that the walls behind all the\r\naltars in the church have been more or less decorated with painting,\r\nthough certainly it had not been used generally on the church itself.\r\n\r\nThe point of junction between the Norman choir and the\r\nthirteenth-century work which connects it with the eastern transept may\r\nbe placed at the fourth pier from the eastern tower arch on each side.\r\nThe arch of the triforium next these piers comes close up to them,\r\nwhereas in the corresponding piers to the west there is a space between\r\nthe arch and the pier. The same feature is to be seen in the triforium\r\narch, which is next to the piers of the tower arch, which have five\r\nshafts, the others having only three. It is very probable that the piers\r\nat the entrance of the apse supported a larger transverse arch than the\r\nothers, corresponding in this to the great tower arch, and that the\r\nsupporting piers had, like those at the entrance of the choir, five\r\nshafts. These piers, the body of which forms a part of Carileph’s Norman\r\nwork, untouched where they face into the aisles, have been encased on\r\nthe choir face with very rich and tasteful decoration of about the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century. Above, upon each side of the choir, is\r\na figure of an angel under a canopy, that on the south side holding a\r\ncrown in the left hand, the other having lost the uplifted hand and what\r\nit once held. They are the only two left out of a numerous host of\r\nstatues once decorating the church, and their beauty makes the\r\ndestruction which has befallen the others the more to be regretted.\r\n\r\nAfter the Nine Altars was finished and the connecting part between it\r\nand the choir completed, a new vault was put on to the choir, and the\r\nwhole of the original Norman vault was taken down. The reason for this\r\nwas almost certainly an artistic one: the sumptuously decorated vault of\r\nthe Nine Altars being of a pointed form, while the original plain vault\r\nof the choir was semicircular, it would have been very difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, when the great transverse arch was taken down, to bring\r\nthese two forms into harmonious combination. It was replaced by one\r\nwhich to a great extent in its mouldings and decoration corresponds with\r\nthat of the Nine Altars. This vault is in five compartments, and has\r\nfour richly moulded transverse arches in addition to the eastern arch of\r\nthe crossing. These arches are supported alternately on the main\r\nvaulting-shafts, which rise from the floor, and on triple shafts, which\r\nrise from the level of the triforium floor, and originally received the\r\ndiagonal ribs of the Norman vault. The diagonal ribs spring from the\r\nouter shafts of the three semi-shafts and from the corresponding outer\r\nshafts next to the main vaulting-shafts. The vault is quadripartite, but\r\nin the eastern bay is an additional rib on each side--a quasi ridge-rib,\r\nwhich runs north and south from the spandrils between the clerestory\r\narches, and unites at the intersection of the diagonal ribs. The\r\nadditional rib on the north side springs from a draped male seated\r\nfigure, on each side of which is a lacertine creature with its back to\r\nthe figure, and its head turned so that the mouth touches the hair,\r\nwhile the tail curves towards the feet; that on the south side springs\r\nfrom an angel. The wall ribs spring from shafts of Frosterley marble,\r\nresting on inserted corbels or on the capitals of the Norman\r\nvaulting-shafts. In the eastern angle of the eastern bay the wall rib on\r\neach side springs from the head of a small canopy, which contains a\r\nsculptured figure; that on the north side a demibishop blessing; that on\r\nthe south the upper half of a male figure.\r\n\r\nWhatever difficulty, however, there may have been in collecting the\r\nnecessary funds for the erection of this noble addition to the church of\r\nBishop William of St. Carileph, first projected by Bishop Poore, no\r\nexpense or pains has been spared in its being carried out to perfection,\r\nand the vault of the Nine Altars and choir, the last part of this great\r\nwork, with its enrichment of dog-tooth ornament of various and graceful\r\nforms, and bosses of foliage and figure subjects, fitly completes the\r\nbuilding in a style no less beautiful and effective than the walls which\r\nsupport it. It may be asserted without fear of contradiction that no\r\nmore effective or majestic vault crowns any church in our country.\r\n\r\nThe cloister occupies a considerable space of ground left open at the\r\ncentre, where the lavatory was placed, and was enclosed on the north\r\nside by the church, and on the other sides by those various structures\r\nwhich had relation to the household economy of the monastery and to its\r\ndomestic and political life. Around it, in the dormitory and refectory,\r\nthe monks slept, lived, and ate. They studied in the library and in the\r\nsmall wooden chambers--carells, as they were called--one of which was\r\nplaced in front of each compartment of the windows of the north alley,\r\nwhich, like the east one, was glazed, the latter containing in its\r\nwindows the history of St. Cuthbert. In the west alley the novices had\r\ntheir school, where they were taught by the master of the novices, \"one\r\nof the oldest monks that was learned,\" who had opposite to them \"a\r\npretty seat of wainscot, adjoining to the south side of the treasury\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\nIn the treasury, situated at the north end of the crypt under the\r\ndormitory, and which is still divided by its ancient iron grating, were\r\nkept the title-deeds and other muniments of the church, in themselves no\r\nsmall treasure. At the other end of the same crypt was the common house,\r\nthe only place where there was a fire for ordinary use, and which was\r\nfrequented by the monks as their room for converse and recreation, and\r\nwhich had in connection with it a garden and a bowling alley.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter-house on the east side the monks met the Prior between\r\nfive and six o’clock \"every night there to remain in prayer and\r\ndevotion\" during that time. Here also at other times they assembled in\r\nchapter to regulate all matters connected with the life within the\r\nbody, and to order the many transactions which as a great corporation\r\nthe convent necessarily had with the world without. Close by, on the one\r\nside of the chapter-house, out of which it opened, was the prison, where\r\nfor minor offences a monk was confined; and on the other side was the\r\npassage through which his body was conveyed to his last home in the\r\ncemetery beyond.\r\n\r\nOpening out of the dormitory to the east, at its south end, where a\r\nmodern doorway has replaced the earlier one, is a room which was called\r\nby the monks \"the loft,\" and which forms, in connection with the\r\nrefectory, the south side of the cloister. It was the place where the\r\nmonks, with the Subprior presiding, ordinarily dined, having beneath it\r\nwhat was once the cellar of the convent. Beyond this, to the east, was\r\nthe refectory, or frater-house, standing above the early crypt which has\r\nalready been described, where the Prior and monks dined together on\r\nMarch 20--St. Cuthbert’s Day. Whatever it was before then, though\r\npossibly the original building still remained, in part at least,\r\nunaltered, it was entirely reconstructed by Dean Sudbury (1662-84), who\r\nmade it into the library, transferring the books from the old library\r\nadjoining to the chapter-house, and filling it with the handsome and\r\ncommodious oak cases which now furnish it. Near to it, on the\r\nsouth-west, is the kitchen of the monastery, now attached to the\r\ndeanery, an octagonal building which well deserves examination.\r\n\r\nReturning to the cloister, there may still be seen at the centre of the\r\ngarth what is left above ground of the lavatory. It was originally an\r\noctagonal structure, the upper part being occupied as a dovecote. The\r\nbasin was begun in 1432, and completed the next year. The marble\r\nstones of the basin, which still exists, were brought from\r\nEggleston-on-the-Tees, of the Abbot of which monastery they were bought.\r\nThe basin is not _in situ_, but has at some time been removed from its\r\noriginal situation, \"over against the frater-house door,\" where the\r\nfoundations of a circular, or octagonal, building were discovered in\r\n1903, and with them those of an earlier building, square in form, with\r\nthe substructure of an earlier basin.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding the description of the church, it is necessary that a\r\nfew words should be said about the exterior. It has charms of its own\r\nwhich, in spite of the disasters it has undergone in the shape of paring\r\ndown and refacing, still makes it one of our noblest churches.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that, on account of the removal of some inches from\r\nthe surface of the stone,[10] and the consequent curtailment of\r\nmouldings in their projections and hollows, there is a want of light and\r\nshade which much detracts from its effect when seen near at hand.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the first impression made is perhaps one of disappointment. The\r\neast end is especially flat and bald, and with its ill-designed modern\r\npinnacles forms but a poor clothing to the wondrous beauty which is to\r\nbe seen within the Nine Altars. But with all these drawbacks, when\r\nviewed as a whole, and when distance has lent its compensating power,\r\nthe cathedral, its lofty central tower rising in harmonious combination\r\nwith the two western ones, stands sublime in its grand outline, and\r\nfitly crowns the hill of Durham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINCHALE PRIORY\r\n\r\nBY J. TAVENOR-PERRY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans had completed the subjection of the Brigantes they\r\nconstructed a great military road through the centre of their country\r\nfrom Eburicum, which became the capital of the province, to the Tweed\r\nand the country beyond. This road intersected the county of Durham from\r\nnorth to south, and much of its course can still be traced from its\r\npoint of entry at Pierce Bridge, through Vinovium or Binchester in\r\nAuckland, Epiacum or Lanchester, and Vindomora or Ebchester where it\r\npasses over the Derwent into Northumberland. From Binchester a branch\r\nroad led by way of Chester-le-Street to the Pons Ælii or Newcastle,\r\nwhich was continued by another branch to Jarrow and South Shields\r\npassing along the south bank of the Tyne. This great military road and\r\nthe branch to Newcastle were cut through the dense forest which then\r\ncovered the whole of Durham and which continued through Saxon times to\r\nform an almost impassable boundary, save by these roads, between the\r\nclosely associated provinces of Deira and Bernicia. The considerable\r\nremains of the Roman towns still standing after the conquest of\r\nNorthumbria by the Angles were no doubt occupied by them as settlements;\r\nand we find it stated in the life of St. Cuthbert that when he was\r\ncrossing the wild country of Durham and was like to be starved he found\r\nsuccour from someone residing in the buildings still remaining at\r\nChester-le-Street. Along the sides of the roads, between the towns,\r\nwould be the ruins, not then entirely destroyed, of villas and other\r\nbuildings which may have formed places for rest or refuge to those who\r\nlike the saint traversed these dangerous forest paths, from which may\r\nhave been derived the names of localities still in use although the\r\nruins after which they were called have long since been forgotten. The\r\nmonks who were conveying the body of St. Cuthbert to its final\r\nresting-place were directed to take it to Dunholm, and an accident\r\nrevealed to them the obscure place which then bore that name; and when\r\nSt. Godric was directed to repair to Finchale and there build himself a\r\nhermitage, he only discovered there was a place so called by a chance\r\nconversation he had with a monk at Durham.\r\n\r\nThe name of Finchale must have been well known in the ninth century if\r\nwe accept the common and reasonable belief that it was a place of\r\nmeeting of two or three important councils concerned with the affairs of\r\nNorthumbria. Its position in reference to the great road passing to the\r\nSouth, its accessibility to the neighbouring town of Chester-le-Street\r\nonly three or four miles distant, and its comparative seclusion in the\r\ngreat surrounding forest made it particularly suitable for such\r\nmeetings, which were held, as Bishop Stubbs says in his _Constitutional\r\nHistory_, generally on the confines of states whence those assembled\r\nmight easily retire at nightfall to safer places. The councils held in\r\nNorthumbria during the latter part of the eighth century met at a time\r\nwhen the country was not only disturbed by internal troubles, but\r\nalready threatened by the Danish pirates along the coast; and the forest\r\ndepths of Durham were safer for such meetings than the more open lands\r\nof Northumberland or Yorkshire. The affix of \"hale,\" the Saxon \"hal,\"\r\nsignifies the existence of a hall or some building, perhaps the remains\r\nof a Roman villa, which would have served as a temporary shelter for the\r\nmembers of a council, of which all traces have long since disappeared;\r\nbut, taking all the circumstances together, we may fairly assume that\r\nFinchale was the place in which these Northumbrian councils met, and the\r\nname still lingered in the locality when St. Godric established himself\r\nwithin its glades on the banks of the rushing Wear.\r\n\r\nThis Godric, whose name is indissolubly associated with Finchale Priory,\r\nalthough he was in no sense the founder of it, was as selfish and dirty\r\nan old anchorite as ever attained the brevet rank of sainthood. Born\r\nabout 1065, the first thirty years of his life were spent as a pedlar\r\nand sailor, during which he travelled far and wide, and met with many\r\nadventures; and the remainder he spent in pilgrimages or a hermit-life\r\nof penance and prayer. The _Dictionary of National Biography_ gives a\r\nvery complete history of him, compiled from all available sources, the\r\nmost important being the MS. life by his contemporary Nicholas of\r\nDurham. While he was leading the roving life of a pedlar he was nearly\r\ndrowned in trying to catch a porpoise, and afterwards made a pilgrimage\r\nto Rome, presumably in thankfulness for his rescue. But the time was\r\nunfortunate, for it appears to have been about 1086, when Gregory VII.,\r\nHildebrand, had just died in exile, when the Anti-Pope Clement III. was\r\nin possession of the Vatican, while the newly elected Pope Victor III.\r\nwas afraid to enter Rome, which then lay sunk in the most frightful\r\nanarchy. The spectacle he beheld could scarcely then have induced him to\r\naccept a religious vocation; and we find that for sixteen years\r\nafterwards he led a seafaring life, trading between England, Scotland,\r\nFlanders and Denmark, presently going so far afield as the Holy Land,\r\nwhere the Chronicler’s description of him as \"Gudericus pirata de regno\r\nAngliae\" sufficiently indicates the character of his occupation.\r\nReturning thence, he paid a visit to the shrine of St. James of\r\nCompostella; and when he reached home he accepted a menial position in\r\nthe house of a countryman, which suggests that he had not made much\r\nmoney by his ventures. But with a restless spirit on him he went two\r\nmore pilgrimages to Rome, and the second time he took his mother with\r\nhim carrying her, it is said, on his shoulders where the way was\r\ndifficult. It was on this journey that he was accompanied by a lady of\r\nwondrous beauty, whom he met on his way in London, who left him there\r\nagain on his return, and who nightly washed his feet; a story which\r\nperhaps grew out of the custom of noble ladies, and which became more\r\ncommon later on, of washing the feet of pilgrims in penance for some\r\nspecial sin, in the manner described by Charles Reade in _The Cloister\r\nand the Hearth_. On his return, somewhere about 1104, he settled for a\r\ntime at Carlisle, and then went to share his cell with a hermit named\r\nAelrice, by Wolsingham, and perhaps learn the lessons which were to\r\nguide him in his future life. After a stay here of only seventeen months\r\nthe hermit died, and directed, he believed, by St. Cuthbert, Godric went\r\nagain on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, after which he was instructed to\r\nreturn and take up his residence at Finchale. Not knowing the locality\r\nby name he returned to Durham where he resided for some time until a\r\nchance conversation disclosed the whereabouts of the place.\r\n\r\nWhen he at length retired to Finchale he seems to have found there the\r\nremains of some ancient building, perhaps of a Roman villa, which may\r\nhave given its name to the place, and which may not only have formed a\r\nsufficient residence for the hermit but for the other members of his\r\nfamily who came to reside with him. The site of this dwelling was a\r\nlittle nearer to Durham than is the present Priory, and the lands around\r\nwere a hunting-ground (the villa may have been a hunting-lodge)\r\nbelonging to Bishop Ralph Flambard who gave Godric permission to settle\r\nhere, so that possession must have been taken before 1128, the date of\r\nthe Bishop’s death. Adjoining to this residence he seems to have built\r\na wooden chapel which was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and about\r\ntwenty years after he built another of stone which was consecrated by\r\nBishop William de St. Barbara, dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre and St.\r\nJohn Baptist, and regularly served by a priest from Durham. As well as\r\nthe many self-imposed mortifications he endured, he was much troubled by\r\nthe serpents with which the place abounded, but which, at his command,\r\ndeparted; but if we may believe the equally veracious story of \"the\r\nloathly worm of Lambton,\" a witch as well as a saint had a hand in that\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nGodric, who was bedridden with rheumatism, the result of his senile\r\nexcesses, for eight years before his death, died in 1170, during the\r\nepiscopacy of Bishop Hugh de Puiset, or Pudsey, who appears to have\r\npersonally interested himself in the Finchale oratory; and under his\r\ndirections two monks from the Durham convent, named Henry and Reginald,\r\ntook up their residence in the place. In 1180 Pudsey confirmed the\r\npriory of Durham in their possession of Finchale and added lands and\r\nother benefactions to those already granted by Flambard; and thus no\r\ndoubt the attention of his son Henry was drawn to the place.\r\n\r\nHenry de Pudsey, who may be regarded as the founder of Finchale, was\r\nBishop Pudsey’s eldest illegitimate son, and must have been born some\r\nlong time before his father succeeded to the see as the Bishop had other\r\nchildren younger than Henry. His mother was Adelaide de Percy from whom\r\nhe appears to have inherited a good deal of land in Craven, as well as\r\nthe manors of Wingate and Haswell, with which he afterwards endowed\r\nFinchale. At some period not long before the death of Godric he seems to\r\nhave been engaged in founding a small establishment for Austen Canons at\r\na place called Bakstanford not far from Neville’s Cross to which the\r\nmonks of Durham seem to have objected as an intrusion of a foreign order\r\nwithin their immediate sphere of influence. Whether it was in\r\nconsequence of their protests or at the wish of his father is uncertain,\r\nbut he suspended his operations and transferred his endowments to\r\nFinchale; and there he erected new monastic buildings for the\r\naccommodation of a colony of Benedictines from Durham who, under Thomas\r\nthe Sacrist as Prior, took possession of the convent in 1196, a year\r\nafter the death of Bishop Pudsey. It was apparently the intention also\r\nof Henry to rebuild Godric’s church in a more suitable manner, but in\r\n1198 he became involved in some political troubles and went crusading in\r\n1201 from which he did not return until 1212; and he left the rebuilding\r\nof the church to be carried out by the community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PISCINA IN CHOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe building of a new church seems to have been taken in hand in 1242, a\r\nyear memorable in the annals of Durham Cathedral as the one which saw\r\nthe beginning of the great eastern transept of the \"Nine Altars,\" under\r\nthe auspices of Prior Thomas of Melsamby, of whom Canon Greenwell says:\r\n\"He was one of the greatest men who have sat in the prior’s chair at\r\nDurham.\" The subservient position which Finchale held to the Durham\r\nconvent necessitated the assent of its Prior to so important an\r\nundertaking; and it is not improbable that he may have pointed out the\r\nnecessity of the work and that his architect, Richard de Farnham, was\r\nresponsible for the design. Although of but modest dimensions for a\r\npriory church, and but little longer and wider than the chapel which the\r\nBrus family had recently built near by at Hartlepool, it was still on\r\ntoo ambitious a scale for the limited resources of the convent; and the\r\nwork dragged on for a number of years, and was never completed in its\r\nentirety. Its chief internal dimensions were--total length of nave and\r\nchoir 194 feet and of the transepts 99 feet; the widths of the nave and\r\nchoir were 23 feet and of the transepts 21 feet, while the width across\r\nthe unbuilt aisles would have been 52 feet. But the aisles would seem\r\nnever to have been finished, and though Mackensie Walcot pathetically\r\nsays that \"it was the hand of the monk which pulled down the chapel of\r\nthe transept and the aisles of the choir and nave\" it seems more than\r\nlikely that they were never begun, and that the idea was abandoned for\r\nlack of funds soon after the nave and choir arcades had been completed.\r\nIt is probable that the choir only was roofed in in a temporary manner,\r\nand that the nave and perhaps the transepts as well were not enclosed\r\nuntil the works were seriously resumed in the next century. The wars\r\nwith Scotland caused much trouble within the county of Durham, and\r\ndoubtless affected the revenues of the priory, although there is nothing\r\nto show that the monks were disturbed in any way by the invaders; but\r\ntwice the Scotch armies appeared upon the Wear, first under the Douglas\r\njust before the treaty of Northampton made in 1328, and again in 1346\r\nwhen they were defeated at the Battle of Neville’s Cross within sight of\r\nthe cathedral.\r\n\r\nAll works were suspended at Durham as well as at Finchale for the same\r\nreasons, but with the return of peace and under the energetic sway of\r\nPrior John Fossor they were resumed; and no doubt under his direct\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOIR.]\r\n\r\ninfluence and perhaps with his assistance the completion of the church\r\nat Finchale was undertaken. The account rolls of the priory from 1348\r\nbegin to mention large quantities of material bought for the works and\r\nmoney expended upon labour until 1372 when we may consider the fabric of\r\nthe church was finished. Instead of building the aisles as originally\r\nintended, they filled up the moulded arches of the arcades with walling\r\nin which they inserted traceried windows; and they seemed to have roofed\r\nin the buildings at a level but little above the top of the arches\r\nwithout any clerestory but sufficiently high to clear the great arches\r\nof the crossing. Whether the crossing was vaulted is not quite certain,\r\nbut some stones found among the ruins seem to indicate remains of groin\r\nribs, and it was raised as a low tower, and covered in all probability\r\nwith a squat, leaded spire such as those which once stood on the western\r\ntowers of the cathedral. The windows which had their heads filled in\r\nwith reticulated tracery were, with those of Easington Church and those\r\ninserted in the cathedral by Prior Fossor, among the most important\r\nDecorated work in the county. The east end of the choir had originally\r\nthree lancet windows, but either at this time or later a large traceried\r\nwindow was inserted in their place, the cost of reglazing which appears\r\nin the accounts for 1488. A reredos to the high-altar was erected about\r\n1376 during the period when the great Neville screen was in course of\r\nconstruction in the cathedral. The exact position it occupied in the\r\nchoir is not now evident, as the position of the original double piscina\r\n(see p. 135) and the sedilia left but little room for such an erection,\r\nand it seems to have involved some alteration in the arrangements of the\r\neast end. It is clear from existing remains that it was originally\r\nintended to build a chapel on the east side of the north transept and\r\npossibly a corresponding one to the south transept, the former with an\r\naltar dedicated to St. Godric and the latter to the Blessed Virgin, but\r\nthese chapels were abandoned at the completion; the whole south transept\r\nbecame the Lady Chapel, and it has been suggested that the shrine of St.\r\nGodric was removed to the extreme east end of the choir, from which it\r\nwas cut off by the new reredos, in which case another piscina which has\r\ndisappeared must have been made for the service of the high-altar. The\r\nancient sedilia of which there were three were cut into and reduced to\r\ntwo when the large traceried window was inserted in the south wall of\r\nthe choir, and our illustration (see p. 137) shows not only this\r\nalteration but what is supposed to have been the base of the reredos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCH FROM THE NORTH-WEST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE RUINS OF FINCHALE PRIORY.]\r\n\r\nThe arches, which had been left open on the eastern face of the\r\ntransepts, were filled in in the same manner as the nave arcades but\r\nwith two-light windows in the walling except in the case of the south\r\ntransept where there is a five-light window, with the heads uncusped,\r\nbeneath which was the altar of the Blessed Virgin. In 1469 sixty\r\nshillings was paid for glazing this window. The west walls of the\r\ntransepts contain the only original windows left complete, the south\r\ntransept having a short lancet which looked over the cloister roof, and\r\nthe north transept has two narrow and lofty lancets. The lancets at the\r\nnorth end of the transept were doubtless removed for a traceried window\r\nas in the choir; but the triplets of the west front were left\r\nundisturbed, and their remains and the beautifully simple west front,\r\ntogether with the lancets of the transepts, are shown in our\r\nillustration (see p. 139).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT OF THE CHAPTER HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRYPT UNDER REFECTORY.]\r\n\r\nThe conventual buildings were all placed on the south side of the church\r\nand their arrangement, so far as they exist at the present time, is\r\nshown on the general plan (see p. 140). They were to a great extent\r\nerected at the same time as the church, that is during the thirteenth\r\ncentury, but were far from completed, and the account rolls show that\r\nthey were not finished before the latter half\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRIOR’S LODGING.]\r\n\r\nof the fifteenth century; but it is quite possible that some of the\r\nbuildings erected by Henry de Pudsey continued in use until the new ones\r\nwere ready for occupation. The chapter-house adjoins the south transept\r\nand still retains its front over which one of the dormitory windows can\r\nyet be seen (see p. 141). To the south of the cloister are considerable\r\nremains of the refectory, raised, as at Durham, above a vaulted basement\r\n(see p. 142); it was lighted by a fine range of lancet windows on either\r\nside, and had a fireplace at the west end, and over it was another\r\nchamber the use of which is not apparent. By the west front of the\r\nchurch a guest-house for the poorer travellers was erected about 1464 in\r\ntwo storeys, the lower one containing an oven; but the superior guests\r\nwere entertained in the Prior’s lodging. Although surrounded by earlier\r\nbuildings, the cloister was not completed until the second building\r\nepoch, the north walk occupying the site of the proposed south aisle of\r\nthe nave, and the original doorway which had been built to be the south\r\ndoor of the church now crosses the east walk at the north end.\r\n\r\nThe Prior’s lodgings (see p. 143) form an important and picturesque\r\ngroup of buildings standing by themselves to the south-east of the\r\nchurch, much in the same position as those of Durham. The vaulted\r\nbasement under the Prior’s hall and most of the substructure may be the\r\nearliest part of the conventual buildings remaining, and earlier in date\r\nthan the church, though much of the upper storey which contains the\r\nhall, camera and chapel belong to the subsequent periods. The low\r\nbuilding at the west end containing a fireplace, which has been\r\ndescribed as the Prior’s kitchen, seems to be the building which,\r\naccording to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1836, was the \"spacious\r\nentertainment room\" which Mr. Prebendary Spence erected for the use of\r\nthe picnic parties which have in modern times pervaded the ruins. To the\r\nnorth of the Prior’s lodging, separated from it only in the basement\r\nstory, is the building mentioned in the account rolls for 1460 under the\r\nname of the \"Douglestour.\" How it came by this name is uncertain, but as\r\nthe lower part of the building was standing in 1328 when Douglas and his\r\nScots made their raid across Northumberland to the banks of the Wear,\r\nit may have gained it through some association with him. The upper\r\nstorey of the tower formed the Prior’s camera and had at the north end\r\nan embayed window which commanded a charming prospect of the river and\r\nthe Cocken woods beyond. St. Godric was reputed to be the special patron\r\nof women, and this encorbelled window-base was known by them as the\r\n\"wishing-chair\"; but whatever was its charm, the spell was broken when\r\nthe monks left the convent at the Reformation.\r\n\r\nAt the Dissolution, as its income was less than £200 per annum, the\r\nPriory was treated as one of the lesser monasteries and suppressed in\r\n1536, when the site was granted to the Bishop of Durham, and the\r\nbuildings were left neglected; but their ruin was hastened by being\r\ntreated as a stone-quarry. It does not appear that the Priory was ever\r\npurposely damaged otherwise, and it remains, after three centuries of\r\nneglect, a more perfect and picturesque ruin than many of higher\r\nimportance and more beautiful architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONKWEARMOUTH AND JARROW\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. D. S. BOUTFLOWER, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible for the student of history to dissociate the two\r\nnames. In their earliest origin, in the ups and downs of their long\r\nexistence, and almost, if not quite, in their present conditions, the\r\nsister churches have met with one and the same experience. Their\r\nfoundations were laid within the short period of ten years; they have\r\narisen and decayed and revived (and that more than once) almost\r\nsimultaneously. They have shared together honour and neglect, wealth and\r\npoverty. In all things and at all times the supreme desire of their\r\ngreat founder has been fulfilled, and Monkwearmouth and Jarrow have been\r\none. Planted long ago as outposts of religious culture brought oversea\r\nto the mouths of the Wear and the Tyne, the Churches of St. Peter and\r\nSt. Paul are now the centres of populous districts. Like other churches\r\naround them, they have their own busy church life; but, unlike to and\r\nabove the rest, these two stand as witnesses of the antiquity and\r\ncontinuity of the Christian faith in England. The churches where Bede\r\nworshipped are still, at least in part, the churches of the twentieth\r\ncentury. The Gospels which he expounded are heard at their Communion\r\nservices to-day.\r\n\r\nMuch of their history must be sought for and read in the buildings\r\nthemselves. The first thing they will tell us is that they belong to a\r\nvery early period of Saxon art. We have other evidence to assure us that\r\nthese were\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONKWEARMOUTH CHURCH.]\r\n\r\namong the first stone churches in England, and to tell how masons were\r\nbrought from the Continent to erect them. The singular height of the\r\nchurch at Monkwearmouth would lead us to the same conclusion. They were\r\nthus churches of quite a peculiar type, a type destined to undergo many\r\nmodifications in later times. In Monkwearmouth and Jarrow you are face\r\nto face with the earliest form of English ecclesiastical architecture.\r\n\r\nWe have no need to ask about the builders, or to wrangle over the date\r\nof their foundation. There are darker and lighter periods in any\r\nhistory; Monkwearmouth and Jarrow have, indeed, known much of both. But\r\nthe light shines clearly enough upon their early days. For Monkwearmouth\r\nsaw the birth and Jarrow the death of the patriarch of English\r\nhistorians. Both places claim him as altogether their own. In the united\r\nconvent of St. Peter and St. Paul he spent practically the whole of his\r\nlife. Like all great men, he said little about himself; but he has much\r\nto tell us about his twofold home. We turn gladly enough to the writings\r\nof Bede, and specially to his Lives of the Abbots. We find ourselves at\r\nonce in the presence of one who knew how to observe and to describe, to\r\nadmire but never to condemn; one who loved to dwell upon the beautiful\r\nin the characters and works of men; a conscientious man withal, who\r\nsought out and told the truth. It is he that relates to us how\r\nMonkwearmouth and Jarrow grew.\r\n\r\nIt was not fifty years since the Christian faith had been first taught\r\nto the Northumbrians, and less than forty since its permanent\r\nestablishment by the preaching of the gentle Aidan, when there came back\r\nto his native kingdom of Northumbria a man of noble birth and cultured\r\ntraining, Biscop, called Benedict. He had wealth and interest at his\r\ncommand, and, above all things, a fervent zeal concentrated upon a\r\ndefinite purpose. It was an age that had recently witnessed a revival of\r\nmonasticism; the life of contemplation had led on to study; orthodoxy\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD STONE AT MONKWEARMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nwas the aim of trained thinkers; emotional minds dwelt on the\r\ndevotedness of the saintly life. Biscop himself was a traveller and a\r\nstudent; he desired to found his own monastery, and to bring to it\r\ntreasures from foreign lands. His relative, King Ecgfrid, granted him\r\nfor this purpose an estate at the mouth of the Wear (A.D. 672). There he\r\nbuilt the Church of St. Peter, of which the western wall and porch still\r\nremain. He brought with him (as we have seen) masons, and also glaziers,\r\nwho restored to England a science that had long been lost. The building\r\nwas quite peculiar in its dimensions--some 60 feet long, 30 high, and 20\r\nbroad. The singular proportions of Monkwearmouth Church, which have long\r\npuzzled antiquaries, appear to be explained by a sermon in the now\r\nprinted works of Bede, and possibly preached in the church itself on\r\nsome anniversary of its dedication. They correspond with those of\r\nSolomon’s Temple, the units in this last case being cubits. There was a\r\ntruly mathematical love of numbers in the mind of Bede, and he is\r\nevidently pleased to explain how the three dimensions above mentioned\r\nset forth in allegory the three Christian virtues of faith, hope, and\r\ncharity. The windows were small, and set high in the walls of the\r\nbuilding. You may see two of them, their splays adorned with baluster\r\nshafts, in the western wall of the church. The south wall was adorned\r\nwith paintings representing scenes from the Gospel of St. John; a series\r\nof pictures illustrating the Apocalypse occupied the northern wall. The\r\nroof was adorned with portraits of the Virgin and of the Twelve\r\nApostles; the presumption is that it was in the form of a flat ceiling.\r\nThe whole arrangement of the building thus gave fair scope for light,\r\nshelter, and decoration.\r\n\r\nThere was a second church soon afterwards erected at Monkwearmouth,\r\ndedicated to St. Mary. There were also dining-rooms and porches and\r\nsleeping apartments, in connection with the last of which there was an\r\noratory dedicated to St. Lawrence. Where these other buildings lay is\r\nuncertain. Tradition says that they were to the west of the present\r\nchurch. St. Mary’s Church was probably very much in this direction. In\r\nthe fourteenth century \"the old kirk\" was used as a granary.\r\n\r\nThe house at Monkwearmouth grew and prospered, a home of arts and\r\nscience and religion. There Bede began to acquire his wonderful\r\nknowledge, and John the Chanter founded his great school of music. Seven\r\nyears after its foundation (A.D. 681) expansion became a necessity, and\r\na new grant of land was obtained, this time at Jarrow, on the south bank\r\nof the Tyne. Seventeen persons, clerical and lay, were sent thither,\r\ntheir leader being Ceolfrid, to whose care Bede, already for two years\r\nan inmate of the older monastery, was committed. Soon after this event\r\nBiscop departed on his last visit to Rome, leaving his stalwart kinsman\r\nEosterwini to rule at Monkwearmouth. He was absent for more than three\r\nyears, an eventful time, during which both houses suffered grievously\r\nfrom a visitation of the plague. Eosterwini was its most notable victim,\r\nwhilst at Jarrow nearly the whole convent was stricken down. At that\r\nplace, as an anonymous writer informs us, only Ceolfrid and one boy,\r\nobviously Bede, were left to chant the daily services. The above facts\r\nwill explain the delay in the consecration of the great church at\r\nJarrow, which, according to a contemporary inscription still preserved,\r\nwas not dedicated till the fourth year of Ceolfrid’s presidency.\r\n\r\nOf this church only some stones now remain. A smaller church had,\r\nhowever, been first built and consecrated, and it is this which forms\r\nthe chancel of Jarrow Church to-day. Its dimensions do not suggest any\r\nspecial meaning. Twenty-eight feet to the west of it, and lying\r\nprecisely in the same right line, stood at one time a fabric precisely\r\nsimilar to that of St. Peter’s, Monkwearmouth, the same, apparently, in\r\nlength and breadth and height, and lighted by windows of the same type\r\nand in the same position. Annexed to it on the north and south were a\r\nnumber of apartments, undoubtedly to be identified with the _porches_ in\r\nBede’s account of Monkwearmouth, chambers opening by round-headed arches\r\ninto the church itself. The arches on the north side, and vestiges of\r\nthree rooms on the south, remained as late as the year 1769. Probably\r\none such porch as this stood at the eastern end of the building; this we\r\nknow was the case at Monkwearmouth. These apartments, walled off as they\r\nwere from each other, would be used for prayer and study, and sometimes\r\nas places of sepulture. They were probably constructed in imitation of\r\nthe chambers round Solomon’s temple.\r\n\r\nThis, then, appears to have been the church which it took so long to\r\ncomplete, and in this building was set up the dedication stone above\r\nmentioned. It was erected and consecrated under the auspices of King\r\nAldfrid (brother and successor to Ecgfrid), and the Abbot Ceolfrid.\r\nBiscop himself was still abroad, but soon afterwards returned to\r\nEngland, bringing with him many books and pictures, one series of which,\r\ndepicting the events of our Lord’s life, was ranged as a crown round the\r\nChurch of St. Mary in the greater monastery; another, representing the\r\nGospel story by type and antitype, adorned the monastery and Church of\r\nSt. Paul. Biscop’s last homecoming had its sorrows. He found Eosterwini\r\ndead, and his successor Sigfrid slowly dying of consumption. Then there\r\ncame to himself a stroke of paralysis. Very touching is the story told\r\nus of the last days of the two Abbots. The greater man feels the greater\r\nanxiety. His much-prized library is not to be dispersed, but before all\r\nthings the unity of the double foundation is to be maintained. Before\r\nhis end comes he appoints Ceolfrid to govern the united monastery of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe narrative continues till the year 716, when the aged Ceolfrid\r\nresigned his charge, and departed to die, as he hoped, at Rome. But this\r\nwas not to be. His last moments were spent at Langres, near Lyons. But\r\none great work of Northumbrian art passed on by other hands to\r\nItaly--the splendid manuscript of the Vulgate, now known as the Codex\r\nAmiantinus, and preserved in the Medicean Library at Florence.\r\n\r\nBede himself lived on in his old home till the year 735. The story of\r\nhis end is too well known to need repetition here. Before his death\r\nNorthumbria had fallen from its former glory. A period of darkness\r\nsupervenes, broken here and there by the lurid light of Danish\r\ninvasions. Yet the churches of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow lasted on,\r\nsacked, it might be, burned and desolated, but still saved from total\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe period of depression that followed the golden days of the twin\r\nmonasteries has left us but scanty memorials of their history. We begin\r\nto hear of times of insecurity, of attacks made upon the eastern coast\r\nof England by Danish pirates. The situations of the two churches would,\r\nunder these circumstances, be distinctly against them. Jarrow is to this\r\nday conspicuous; it is probably less well known that Monkwearmouth\r\nChurch stood for centuries upon the top of a hill. This is shown quite\r\nclearly in the engraving of the year 1785. The sea rovers would take\r\ntheir own survey of the coast and its harbours, and would make for any\r\nplace that offered promise of pillage. There is much good and rich land\r\nbetween the Wear and the Tyne, and the monks of early days were\r\nassiduous cultivators. The country of Wilfrid and Biscop and Bede was no\r\nuncivilized or neglected part of the world. To a pagan race there would\r\nbe no impediment in the form of religious scruples. The wealth of the\r\nChurch would but invite the spoilers to their prey.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Danes came first to Northern England, to begin with, somewhat\r\ntentatively, in the year 793, harrying the island of Lindisfarne,\r\nplundering its monastery, and burning the church. The next year their\r\nships put into the Tyne. On the hill overlooking the slake, just where\r\nthat river receives its tributary the Don, stood the monastery of\r\nJarrow, Egfrid’s Port lying immediately below it. Here they landed, and\r\ntook such booty as they found. But the people of the neighbourhood\r\nrallied, and drove back the invaders to their ships. Few of them made\r\ngood their escape, for the wind was against them. The storm came up into\r\nthe river, and the fugitives were driven to the shore, where they and\r\ntheir chieftain, Ragner Lodbrog, met with the vengeance they deserved.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that the lesson thus given was not forgotten. We hear\r\nno more of Danish invasions for well on to sixty years. When they\r\nrecommenced, they were directed elsewhere. In the year 851 the Danes\r\nlanded in Sheppey, and this time they came to stay. The chroniclers have\r\nmuch to say about _the Army_; but it was not till the year 875 that it\r\nmarched into Northern England, and then probably not much beyond York;\r\nit moved south two years later. But meanwhile there had no doubt been\r\nmany a raid upon the settlements on the coast. The year 866 was marked\r\nby one of the most serious of these. At that date Hingvar and Hubba\r\nburned the church of Monkwearmouth. The traces of this conflagration are\r\nstill distinctly perceptible. Again in the year 875 the fleet of Halfdan\r\nwas in the Tyne. Contemporaneously with this event took place the flight\r\nfrom Lindisfarne, and the commencement of the journeyings of the body of\r\nSt. Cuthbert.\r\n\r\nHow the Danish power was driven back by Alfred, how his wise policy\r\nreclaimed the half of his kingdom, is a well-known part of our national\r\nhistory. The final triumph was not so much one of war as of peace. The\r\nwisdom of a very great King effected much; the growing strength of\r\nrecovering Christianity did the rest. Never did any ruler so effectually\r\ncombine the forces of secular and spiritual power, or hold them more\r\ntruly in balance and co-operation. The invaders became settlers, and\r\nhave left this part of their history in the names of their new homes.\r\nThis is especially true of Lincolnshire; then, hardly less decidedly, of\r\nYork. But north of the Tees the English population simply retained lands\r\nwhich they had never ceased to occupy. Danish place-names in the county\r\nof Durham are few and far between.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORNAMENTAL STONEWORK, MONKWEARMOUTH CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nThis is so much evidence--and it is worth something--in favour of the\r\nsupposition that the sister churches of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow were\r\nnot left to permanent ruin. The population of the neighbourhood was, and\r\nremained, English, and would no doubt be warmly attached to the ancient\r\nsanctuaries. Their hearts and minds would be as faithful to the sacred\r\nmemories of the past as were those of the wanderers who guarded the body\r\nof St. Cuthbert. That there was no revolution in the history of this\r\nparticular district may be presumed from the silence which veils this\r\npart of the story of their two great churches. The theory here advocated\r\nappears to be further confirmed by the one incident recorded at this\r\nperiod in connection with the church of Jarrow.\r\n\r\nThe old faith in the potency of the relics of the saints remained\r\nunshaken through all periods of sunshine or of gloom. Respect for the\r\npast and for the good clings to the devoted Churchman of every age; it\r\nmay sometimes even be strong enough to overpower his moral principle. It\r\nwas so undoubtedly in the case of Ælfred, a monk of Durham in the early\r\npart of the eleventh century. This man conceived himself to be divinely\r\ncommissioned to visit the sites of ancient monasteries and to gather\r\ntogether the remains of departed martyrs and confessors. He was very\r\nsuccessful in his quest. Hexham and Melrose were laid under\r\ncontribution, and Jarrow was not likely to be forgotten. To it he paid\r\nan annual visit on the anniversary of the death of Bede. At least once\r\nhe prolonged his stay for several days, fasting and praying in the\r\nchurch. Then one morning he departed at a very early hour, and he\r\nreturned no more. What he had done may be inferred from the assurance\r\nwith which he stated in after-years that the remains of Bede were\r\nresting in the grave of St. Cuthbert. From what we know of the man and\r\nof the age there seems little room for dispute about the matter: it\r\nappears, moreover, to have been corroborated at a later date by visual\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe story is of interest to us mainly as bearing witness to the fact\r\nthat in the year 1022 the church of Jarrow remained a popular centre of\r\nworship. In the case of Monkwearmouth history and legend alike fail us;\r\nwe must judge for ourselves. The tower of the church was evidently built\r\nat two distinct periods. The porch and the parvise over it appear to\r\nbelong to the age of the founder. They also show traces of the fires of\r\nthe Danes. This is not the case with the superstructure. Incontestably\r\nof Saxon work, it belongs to the same period which saw the erection of\r\nat least four church towers in the valley of the Tyne. As it exhibits no\r\ntraces of the burning of the year 866, its date and theirs must be\r\nlooked for somewhere in the next two centuries. The reign of the\r\nNorthumbrian Guthred (A.D. 884-894) has been ascertained to be a period\r\nwhen relations between Church and State were more than ordinarily\r\nfriendly. At this time the tower of Monkwearmouth Church may well have\r\nbeen completed. It can hardly have been built at a much later date, for\r\nthere is other and different work in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JARROW CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nsame church which appears to belong to the age before the Conquest. The\r\nmodern arch between nave and chancel rises on its south side from an\r\nancient substructure, of which one feature is the cushion moulding at\r\nits base. There is something here begun by Anglo-Saxon masons, but\r\ncarried out apparently by Norman builders. It was possibly a work of the\r\nreign of Edward the Confessor, and apparently implies some\r\ncontemporaneous reconstruction of the early porch or chancel.\r\n\r\nSubject, then, to the chances of time and of warfare, the churches of\r\nMonkwearmouth and Jarrow still carried on their existence. The latter\r\nwas certainly in use at the date of the Conquest. This was a period of\r\ntrouble and disaster. Oswulf, the Earl of Northumberland, is displaced,\r\nand soon after murders his successor. Gospatric next buys the earldom,\r\nand forthwith rebels. The Conqueror marches northward in person, and\r\nappoints Robert Cummin to the vacant office. He, too, is assassinated in\r\nthe city of Durham. This event is followed by the King’s return, and the\r\nwholesale devastation of the lands north of York. Ethelwin the Bishop,\r\naccompanied by his canons, flees northward with the body of St.\r\nCuthbert. They rest for a night in the church at Jarrow. Their pursuers\r\nfollow on their track and set the building on fire. Northumbria is\r\ndevastated by Norman and Scottish enemies at once; and for nine years\r\nthe land lies waste. During this period we may well believe that both\r\nour churches stood unroofed and desolate; their walls, on the other\r\nhand, certainly resisted the flames, and were preserved to be ere long\r\nthe home of a new band of settlers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest brought in its train a very distinct revival of\r\nmonasticism. This was part of the general movement in favour of order\r\nand authority which then prevailed. It came, no doubt, originally from\r\nRome. It was, in fact, the characteristic of Rome from very early days.\r\nIt made itself felt in the eleventh century by the growth of the\r\nmilitary spirit, and later on by the gradual development of law. It\r\naffected more immediately the religious side of national life. Clerical\r\ncelibacy began to be enforced, and the foundation of monasteries was\r\nencouraged. The foreigners took the lead in this matter, amongst them\r\nWalcher of Lorraine, Bishop of Durham. Hearing of a small party of\r\nmissionary monks who had just arrived at Monkchester (now Newcastle), he\r\nmade haste to invite them to settle in his own territory at Jarrow. We\r\nare told that he gave them the churches there (the plural number is\r\nsignificant). They were soon joined by others who had followed them from\r\nthe South--the men of the North stood aloof; they had at this time good\r\nreason to be suspicious of Southern visitors. The numbers of the monks\r\ngrew, and their patron enlarged their estate to meet their increased\r\nneeds. Besides a large property in land on both sides of the Tyne, they\r\nreceived a grant of the church of Monkwearmouth. Briers and trees were\r\nstanding within its walls; much the same thing was probably true of\r\nJarrow. But they set to work with energy to repair and to acquire and to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nWhat they did at Monkwearmouth we are not able to say. Probably they\r\nextended the eastern porch into the form of a chancel. Two centuries\r\nlater that chancel attained its present peculiar form--long and\r\nnarrow--as became the custom in this part of England; it is also\r\ndecidedly lofty, being apparently intended thus to correspond with the\r\nancient nave. Undoubtedly respect was from the first shown to those who\r\ndesigned the original church. The same right sentiment may be observed\r\nmuch more evidently in the case of Jarrow, with which as their first and\r\nmore important possession Bishop Walcher’s monks proceeded to deal at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned above the existence of two churches at Jarrow, and\r\nhave observed that there exists written corroboration of this. The\r\nsmaller church which stood to the east is the chancel of the present\r\nbuilding. Twenty-eight feet to the west of it was the termination of\r\nthe nave or main block of the western church, built precisely on the\r\nquite mathematical lines of the elder fabric at Monkwearmouth. We may\r\npresume of this building what we know to have been the case at St.\r\nPeter’s, that there was a porch behind the altar, a building, that is to\r\nsay, with three walls and one open side. Such a building still exists in\r\nthe chancel of the Saxon church at Escomb, near Bishop Auckland.\r\nAssuming that the porch at Jarrow was like that at Escomb, square, and\r\nof proportionately larger dimensions, there would be a space of some\r\nthirteen feet intervening between it and the eastern church. It was here\r\nthat the Norman builders would be disposed to erect their tower, and\r\nhere the tower was accordingly built, not foursquare after the Norman\r\nmodel, but in an oblong form. The site occupies a rectangle of thirteen\r\nby twenty-one feet. The lower stages of this structure are essentially\r\nmassive and very distinctly Norman in character. The highest storey, on\r\nthe other hand, less well executed as some think, has its own\r\nornateness; it was probably erected in the succeeding generation. If so,\r\nwe understand the better the set-back of its northern and southern\r\nsides; the architect employed had, no doubt, his own opinion to the\r\neffect that the tower ought to have been square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH SNAKES, MONKWEARMOUTH CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nThe principle adopted by Bishop Walcher’s monks appears to have been\r\nthat of reverent adaptation to immediate needs. They wished to repair\r\nand to add, but not to destroy. Had their stay at their new home been\r\nprolonged, the case would in time have been altered. Large medieval\r\nbuildings would have taken the place of the more primitive original\r\nstructures. But their sojourn at Jarrow lasted for only eight years. In\r\nthe year 1083 Bishop William of St. Carileph transferred them to his\r\ncathedral. The extruded canons were placed at Auckland and Darlington,\r\nand the Evesham Benedictines occupied the mother-church of the diocese.\r\n\r\nIt was all done in haste. It was repented of, no doubt, at leisure. In\r\nthe enthusiasm of the moment Bishop William founded the one and only\r\nabbey in the Bishopric of Durham. His successors, we may well believe,\r\ndeplored what was politically and ecclesiastically a great mistake. But\r\nwhat was done could not be undone by anything less than a revolution.\r\nThe Abbey of Durham grew and was strong. The magnificence of its\r\nbuildings tells of the wealth of the builders. The Durham Household Book\r\nspeaks of the stir and pomp and cheerfulness of its daily life.\r\nMeanwhile, the two more ancient sanctuaries were reduced to the\r\ninsignificant condition of Cells. They were left with their old estates,\r\neach under the rule of a master, appointed or removed by the Prior of\r\nDurham at his will. Each master had one monk with him for company,\r\nsometimes two, and very rarely three. The masters appear to have taken\r\nbut little interest in the spiritual affairs of their churches. The\r\nnaves of these buildings were considered the property of the\r\nparishioners, who executed repairs at their own cost; an ill-paid\r\nstipendiary, called the chaplain or parish priest, discharged all\r\nparochial duties. The church of Jarrow had its chapels at Wallsend, at\r\nShields, and at Westoe. The first named of these was left very much to\r\nitself; the very altar-fees of the other chapels, as well as those of\r\nthe churches, were the perquisite of the master, while the services of\r\nthe chaplain were remunerated at very much the same rate as those of the\r\nmonastery barber.\r\n\r\nThe result as regards the fabrics was much what might have been\r\nexpected. The nave at Monkwearmouth was left to itself; that at Jarrow\r\nwas at some time extended so as to include the ground occupied by its\r\neastern porch. The other porches or chapels that once flanked this\r\nbuilding may have served for a while as parts of the parish church; then\r\nthey fell one after another by a lingering process of decay. On the\r\nother hand, Monkwearmouth Church was in course of time enlarged; a north\r\naisle was added in the thirteenth century; its very pleasing doorway has\r\nbeen fortunately preserved. About the same time two rather large windows\r\nwere set to lighten the east end of the nave of Jarrow.\r\n\r\nThe case was different with the conventual part of the two churches. At\r\nMonkwearmouth, as we have seen, the choir was made long and lofty. Two\r\nDecorated windows were placed on its southern side; a third, similar to\r\nthe others, stood in the north wall, all traces of which seem to have\r\nbeen destroyed in quite recent times. The date of these windows is fixed\r\nby an entry in the account rolls under the year 1347. A little later an\r\neast window of five lights was erected; it has been reproduced from its\r\nfragments, and is not without merit. The design at Monkwearmouth is,\r\nhowever, far better than the workmanship.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Jarrow it was not necessary to find a new chancel; the\r\nold eastern church was quite sufficiently roomy. What was required was\r\nlight, and this was provided first by a north-east window and an east\r\nwindow, each of three lights, and afterwards by two additional windows\r\nof three lights, one on each side of the western end of the chancel. The\r\nlatest of these was inserted in the year 1350.\r\n\r\nThe two houses conducted their financial affairs in an easy way. They\r\nwanted enough to live upon, but had no further ambitions. They did not\r\ndevelop their estates, and were careless as to their fisheries. Jarrow\r\nwas the richer house, but Monkwearmouth was reckoned the healthier;\r\nthither came the monks of Durham to enjoy the bracing air. Once, at any\r\nrate, Jarrow had to contribute to their maintenance. The usual donations\r\nwere made--subscriptions to subsidies and to the needs of scholars at\r\nOxford. A singular entry is often repeated in the rolls--the cost of\r\nwine for the parishioners’ Communion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch was the uneventful life of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth till the\r\nrevolution of 1536, which brought an end to the existence of the smaller\r\nmonasteries. These two were valued at £38 14s. 4d. and £26 9s. 9d.\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe property of both the cells passed thenceforth into lay hands, and\r\nthe churches became poorer still. To Jarrow was preserved the meagre\r\nendowment of ten marks; to Monkwearmouth two marks less. The former\r\nchurch had, moreover, Easter offerings and a small parsonage. The\r\nincumbents of both had, of course, an uncertain income from fees. No\r\nattempt to mend matters was made till the commencement of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBefore that period had arrived the neglected churches had at last fallen\r\nquite into decay. The parishioners had had to do something; what they\r\ndid was to destroy the nave of Jarrow, and the southern (or Saxon) wall\r\nof Monkwearmouth. These demolitions took place in 1782 and 1806\r\nrespectively. The result of the alterations and rebuildings no doubt\r\ncommended itself to those then concerned with such matters. We find a\r\npicture of the new Monkwearmouth Church accompanied with a note of much\r\nsatisfaction in a contemporary number of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\nRestorations followed in 1861 and 1873, but they could not give back the\r\npast. What was spared has been treated with reverence. The west front of\r\nMonkwearmouth still remains. The church, now apparently sunk into a\r\nhollow, is surrounded by poor and crowded tenements, built upon ballast\r\nbrought from the Thames. The medieval chancel is there, its restored\r\nwindows now filled with Kempe’s beautiful glass. The music of its\r\nservices is worthy of the church of John the Chanter. Only we regret the\r\nloss of the Saxon Church as it once stood upon its hill overlooking\r\nriver and sea. Jarrow has been more fortunate; it still crowns the hill\r\nabove its wide slake--a landmark well known to all those who use the\r\nwaterways of the Tyne. It, too, has its points of interest, its Saxon\r\nchancel and its Norman tower. Much, of course, is missing in both\r\nplaces. But there is still more than enough to attract and to fascinate\r\nthe mind of the Englishman and the Christian, who looks back to the\r\nglories of that good old time that gave to Northumbria and to the world\r\nthe life of the one man that was Venerable--the learning and the labours\r\nof Bede.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH CHURCHES OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY WILFRID LEIGHTON\r\n\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, the parish churches of Durham are best described as of\r\nthe \"homely order,\" and one may search the county in vain for an\r\noft-recurring and distinctive feature, such as the graceful spires of\r\nNorthamptonshire, or the splendid Perpendicular towers, which\r\ndistinguish so many of the churches of Somerset. In the country of\r\nBenedict Biscop and the Venerable Bede it is natural that we should look\r\nfor other matters of interest than striking architecture, and\r\nundoubtedly many of the churches carry evidence of a high antiquity,\r\nthough only perhaps a fragment of dog-tooth moulding breaking through\r\nlath and plaster restoration of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nTwo churches, Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, are no less interesting for the\r\nSaxon remains which they contain than for their association with the\r\nearly Christian Fathers of the North. Both these churches date from the\r\nlatter part of the seventh century. At the time of their erection\r\nTheodore of Tarsus, to whom the division of the country into parishes is\r\ngenerally attributed, was Archbishop of Canterbury; but it would not at\r\nthis early date be correct to describe them as parish churches, for it\r\nwas not until the decay of the brotherhoods to which they were attached\r\nthat they ceased to be other than the chapels of their respective\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this volume full justice has been done to these\r\nearly churches, but some reference must be made here to the church of\r\nEscomb, in the west of the county. It is perhaps of an equally early\r\ndate and a remarkably perfect example of a church of the period. Very\r\nlittle is known of its early history, but after the Dissolution it was\r\nregarded as a chapel-of-ease to St. Andrew’s, Auckland. In 1879 it had\r\nfallen into disuse, a new church having been built at some distance. But\r\nupon the \"re-discovery\" of the nature of the old building, in that year,\r\nfunds were at once raised for its repair.\r\n\r\nThe church consists of a square chancel, a nave, and a porch as a later\r\naddition. The church has undoubtedly been built with stones from the\r\nRoman camp of Binchester, many of which show the diamond broaching.\r\nProfessor Baldwin Brown is of the opinion that the chancel arch, which\r\nis the most striking feature of the interior, was removed bodily from\r\nthe camp and set up in pre-Conquest times in its present position.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the chancel there are two original windows, with\r\nsemicircular heads, cut out of single blocks, and jambs battering\r\ninwards. There are two original windows on the north side with square\r\nheads. The sills of these windows are thirteen feet from the floor\r\nlevel, and another window in the west end is placed still higher. At\r\nlater dates the walls have been pierced with other windows, two in the\r\nsouth wall of the nave, one in the west gable, one in the east end, and\r\none in the south wall of the chancel. Between the two original windows\r\non the south is a \"Saxon\" sundial. The original entrances were in the\r\nnorth and south walls of the nave, and there is a later doorway in the\r\nchancel. A fragment of an early cross is preserved in the church.\r\n\r\nContemporary with these churches there existed at Hartlepool a monastic\r\nhouse said by Bede to have been founded by Heiu, the first Northumbrian\r\nnun, and subsequently extended by St. Hilda, before her transition to\r\nWhitby in 657.\r\n\r\nAlthough continued after this date, its history during the period of the\r\nDanish invasion is lost. The present Church of St. Hilda is mentioned in\r\nthe confirmatory charter to Guisborough Priory of Bishop Pudsey in 1195,\r\nand in those of several of his successors, and was most likely included\r\nin the original grant with the churches of Hart and Stranton, of which\r\nit was a dependent chapel. In 1308 Bishop Bek, as a reward for the\r\ncontinual devotion, charity, and hospitality of the Prior and convent of\r\nGuisborough, granted them the indulgence, that in the church of Hart and\r\nchapel of Hartlepool, service should, after that date, be perpetually\r\nperformed by a canon of Guisborough.\r\n\r\nStatutes for the government of the church were drawn up by the\r\nCorporation of Hartlepool in 1599, and appear in the Corporation\r\nrecords, whence the following extract:\r\n\r\n     \"Ytt ys ordeyned, that whosoever of this town dothe shott att or\r\n     within the churche or churche steple of thys town, with gun,\r\n     crosbowe, or anie other shott for the kyllinge of any dove, pigeon,\r\n     or anie other foule, shall paye, for every suche offence, to the\r\n     use of the town. 12.d.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1600 the number of \"pues or stalls\" was thirty-three.\r\n\r\nThe first church, though much restored, is the one which still remains,\r\nand the finest of the parish churches in the North. Standing on high\r\nground, the impressive landmark formed by its massive tower and\r\ncrocketed pinnacles, over many miles of land and water, has been\r\nreferred to with admiration by every historian of the county.\r\n\r\n     \"The church of Hartlepool differs from most ancient churches in\r\n     being throughout one design, carried out at one time.... It tells,\r\n     as authentically as any written document could, of the rapid growth\r\n     and prosperity which preceded its erection. In the enthusiasm to\r\n     which success gives birth, the merchants of Hartlepool said: ‘We\r\n     will build a church.’ From the first they contemplated a splendid\r\n     design, and this they executed worthily.\"--BOYLE.\r\n\r\nThe church stands to the north-west of the site of St. Hilda’s\r\nFoundation. Its tower is its most striking characteristic. At an early\r\ndate the tower must have shown signs of weakness, and the enormous\r\nbuttresses which increase its picturesqueness so much were added. These\r\nadditions are generally ascribed to the year 1230, and the entrance\r\narch, with a very beautiful but much decayed chevron moulding, cut\r\nthrough the south buttress of the west side, is of the same date. The\r\ntower is of three stages, and the south-west corner forms a turret,\r\nthrough which a staircase leads to the roof. The clerestory windows have\r\nformerly been of three lights each, now built into one, and are very\r\nfine. The original capitals remain, but all the shafts have gone.\r\n\r\nThe west, or main entrance, has been built up. The nave is supported by\r\nfive clustered pillars on each side, with pointed arches. In the wall of\r\nthe south aisle is a piscina. The greater part of the chancel is modern.\r\n\r\nSeveral chantries were attached to the church before the dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries, but the monumental remains are few.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is a large tomb, which was formerly enclosed within\r\nthe walls of the ancient chancel, before the latter was taken down. It\r\nis generally ascribed to the De Bruses, and the armorial shields on the\r\nsides, each charged with a lion rampant, confirm the suggestion.\r\n\r\nDurham possesses another very good example of Early English architecture\r\nin the parish church of Darlington, dedicated to St. Cuthbert. It\r\nconsists of a chancel, north and south transepts, a nave with aisles,\r\nand a central tower crowned by a spire. That it stands on a site of\r\ngreat antiquity is proved by the discovery, in 1866, during restoration,\r\nof fragments of three pre-Conquest crosses, which are now preserved in\r\nthe church. In the charter of Styr, son of Ulf, which is included in a\r\nrecord called by Symeon, the \"Ancient Chartulary of the Church,\" there\r\nis given to St. Cuthbert \"the vill which is called Dearthingtun, with\r\nsac and soc,\" and Symeon again mentions Darlington as one of the places\r\nto which the secularized monks of Durham were removed in 1083 by\r\nWilliam de St. Carileph. On the authority of Geoffry de Coldingham, the\r\nerection of the church has been ascribed to Bishop Pudsey, and the date\r\nto 1190-95.\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance is in the west front, set in a richly moulded\r\narch, with a trefoil-headed niche above. In the second stage of the\r\nfront is an arcade of five arches, and the third stage has three arches,\r\nall with dividing shafts. The arches in the second stage are pierced\r\nalternately with lancet lights. The walls of the aisle were greatly\r\naltered about the middle of the fourteenth century, and all the\r\nsquare-headed windows belong to this period, no features dating from the\r\noriginal erection of the church remaining except the doorways. The north\r\ndoorway has been greatly restored, and the south doorway was originally\r\ncovered by a porch; it has a niche above. The clerestory has an arcade\r\nof twelve arches pierced with four lancet windows on each side. Both\r\ntransepts and the chancel are of two stages, divided by string courses;\r\nbut the south transept is more enriched than the north, both internally\r\nand externally. Buttresses divide the walls of the chancel into three\r\nbays, and the walls and ends of the transepts are similarly divided into\r\ntwo bays each. Those buttresses at the junctions of the transepts and\r\nthe chancel, owing to their great proportion, have much the appearance\r\nof corner turrets. The spire and the higher stage of the tower are of\r\nthe same date as the walls of the aisles. Longstaffe says of the spire:\r\n\"On July 17, 1750, this beautiful spire, considered the highest and\r\nfinest in the North of England, was rent.... The storm occasioned\r\nfifteen yards of the spire to be taken down and rebuilt in 1752....\r\nUnfortunately the mason omitted the moulding at the angles of the new\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally it should be noted that Durham is one of the counties in\r\nwhich spires are comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nThe tower is supported by four arches on clustered shafts, and the nave\r\nis divided from its aisle by four arches on each side. The east wall of\r\nthe chancel is modern. Three sedilia of the Decorated period occupy the\r\nusual position in the chancel. In one of the windows on the east side of\r\nthe south transept occurs the only instance of the dog-tooth ornament in\r\nthe interior of the church, and there is a piscina in both of the side\r\nwalls of the same transept.\r\n\r\nDarlington is the only church in the county which retains a rood-loft.\r\n\r\nOn the south of the chancel is the vestry, which has been greatly\r\nmodernized. The only monumental effigy is that of an unknown lady with a\r\nbook in her hand. It dates from the early thirteenth century, and is\r\nplaced at the west end of the nave.\r\n\r\nAfter the two churches last mentioned, the church at Sedgefield,\r\ndedicated to St. Edmund the Bishop, but formerly dedicated to the\r\nVirgin, is probably the finest in the county. The nave and chancel date\r\nfrom the Early English period. The tower is very fine, of Perpendicular\r\ndate and of three stages, crowned by battlemented parapets and small\r\nspirelets standing on angle buttresses. The Rev. J. F. Hodgson is of the\r\nopinion that it was intended to crown the tower with an open lantern, as\r\nat St. Nicholas’ Cathedral, Newcastle.\r\n\r\nThere are two transepts; the south contains the chapel of St. Thomas,\r\nand in its east wall are two piscinas, one of which is trefoil-headed;\r\nand in the south wall are two pointed recesses occupied by much\r\nmutilated male and female effigies, the latter dating from the later\r\nfourteenth century. The north transept contains the Chapel of St.\r\nKatherine, and is now known as the Hardwick porch. Two of its ancient\r\nwindows still remain, and fix its date as 1328. The east window is\r\nfilled with Late Decorated tracery. The nave is divided from the aisles\r\nby three pointed arches, supported by clustered pillars on moulded\r\nbases. The capitals are richly carved and very interesting.\r\n\r\nThe font is octagonal and of Frosterley marble, dating from the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, and charged on each side with armorial shields,\r\nmost likely carved in the seventeenth century. The stall work of the\r\nchancel is ascribed to the latter part of the seventeenth century, and\r\nthe rich chancel screen to a slightly earlier date.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the chancel is the grave cover of Andrew de\r\nStanley, first master of Greatham Hospital.\r\n\r\nTwo interesting brasses of skeletons in shrouds are preserved in the\r\nvestry, and were originally inlaid in one slab. Another small brass is\r\nin the south transept. It is considered to be one of the earliest in\r\nEngland, and represents a lady in loose robe with tight sleeves and\r\nwimple and hood. There is another brass to the memory of William Hoton,\r\nengraved with a helmet and crest of three trefoils.\r\n\r\nOf the five bells, one is of pre-Reformation date, bearing the\r\ninscription \"✠ TRINITATE SACRA FIAT HEC CAMPANA BEATA,\" and the arms of\r\nRhodes and Thornton.\r\n\r\nThe church at Staindrop, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, was much\r\nmutilated by restorations in 1849, but its sepulchral monuments to\r\nmembers of the Neville family are unrivalled.\r\n\r\nParts of the walls of the nave are of pre-Reformation date, and two of\r\nthe original windows still remain. The north and south aisles were added\r\nto the original structure in the twelfth century, when the nave walls\r\nwere pierced by three arches on each side, supported on cylindrical\r\npillars, with capitals carved in different foliage designs. During the\r\nfollowing century the plan of the church was altered, and an additional\r\nbay added to the west end of the nave, north and south transepts thrown\r\nout, and the tower erected. The tower was of three stages, probably\r\ncrowned by a wooden spire, taken down in 1408, when a fourth stage was\r\nadded. Being built on the original corbel-tables, and overhanging the\r\nsubstructure, it gives the whole a very heavy appearance. About the\r\nsame time the original high-pitched roofs were lowered to the almost\r\nflat roofs which now exist, and the clerestory of the nave built. Before\r\nthe date of the latter alterations extensive changes had been made in\r\nthe church during the fourteenth century, when Ralph, Lord Neville,\r\nunder licence of the Prior and convent of Durham, endowed three\r\nchantries. The original south aisle and transept were removed, and the\r\npresent south aisle, which is much wider than the nave, erected. At the\r\nsouth-east angle of the aisle a small porch or vestry projects, which\r\nwas intended for the use of the priests officiating in the chantries.\r\n\r\nShortly after these alterations, the symmetry of the church being\r\ndestroyed, a new north aisle and transept, of similar dimensions, but\r\nmuch inferior work, were erected. The ancient vestry opening from the\r\nchancel, with _domus inclusa_ above, is very interesting.\r\n\r\nStaindrop is the only church in the county in which the pre-Reformation\r\nchancel screen remains, but the rood-loft which surmounted it has been\r\ndestroyed. The font is octagonal, and of Teesdale marble, decorated with\r\narmorial bearings, and may date from the latter part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe first of the effigies before referred to is that of a lady, and lies\r\nin a recess in the south aisle. It is ascribed to Isabel de Neville,\r\nwife of Robert FitzMeldred, Lord of Raby. \"The costume is an excellent\r\nexample of the dress of a gentlewoman of Western Europe in the second\r\nhalf of the thirteenth century and beginning of the fourteenth.\"\r\nSepulchral effigies of females of this early date are extremely rare.\r\nThe general resemblance of this effigy to that of Aveline, Countess of\r\nLancaster, in Westminster Abbey, who died in 1269, is very striking.\r\n\r\nThe second effigy in point of date is attributed to Euphemia, mother of\r\nRalph, Lord Neville, founder of the chantries and builder of the south\r\naisle, in which it lies in an enriched recess. The third, a female\r\neffigy, is also in the same aisle, and though no doubt representing one\r\nof the Neville family, its exact identity is a matter of some\r\ncontroversy. It dates from the fourteenth century, and the remaining\r\neffigy in the aisle--that of a boy--is of the same date.\r\n\r\nA remarkably fine altar-tomb, with effigies of Ralph Neville, first Earl\r\nof Westmorland, and his wives--Margaret, daughter of Hugh, Earl of\r\nStafford, and Joan, daughter of John of Gaunt--has been described as the\r\nmost splendid in the North of England.\r\n\r\nThe Earl is dressed in a rich suit of full armour, with collar of SS.,\r\nand the ladies in kirtles, with jewelled girdles and sideless surcoats\r\nand mantles. Their arms have been destroyed. The Earl died in 1426.\r\n\r\nThe remaining monument is to the memory of Henry Neville, fifth Earl of\r\nWestmorland, who died in 1564, and his two first wives--Anne, daughter\r\nof Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, and Jane, daughter of Sir Richard\r\nCholmondeley.\r\n\r\nThe monument is of oak, and ornamented with effigies of the Earl’s\r\nchildren and armorial bearings. The Earl is dressed in armour, and an\r\ninscription states that the tomb was made in the year 1560.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the churches already mentioned, the south and south-east\r\ndistricts of the county are rich in churches, worthy, if space availed,\r\nof more than passing notice.\r\n\r\nAt Barnard Castle the church dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin carries\r\nevidence that it was in early times a large and important edifice, and\r\nin the twelfth century consisted of chancel and nave, with north and\r\nsouth aisles. Rebuilding and structural alterations were carried out\r\nfrom time to time until the middle of the fifteenth century, when both\r\ntransepts were rebuilt. The vestry is probably of the same date, and the\r\nchancel arch, which is very fine, slightly earlier. The tower is modern,\r\nand replaced a fifteenth-century structure. The floor of the chancel is\r\nmuch higher than that of the nave, and evidence of a similar difference\r\nin levels is found at Lanchester Church. Two arched recesses, one of\r\nwhich contains an effigy of a priest, are in the north wall of the north\r\ntransept, and a mutilated piscina is in the south wall of the same\r\ntransept. In this church there were four chantry chapels dedicated\r\nrespectively to St. Catherine, St. Helen, St. Margaret, and the Trinity,\r\nand referred to in old records, but their exact position cannot now be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe church at Winston has several sepulchral brasses, but, with the\r\nexception of the walls of the chancel, which contain two remarkable\r\nsingle-light windows, and the arcade and north wall of the nave, is\r\nmodern.\r\n\r\nNearer to Darlington is the Church of St. Andrew at Haughton-le-Skerne.\r\nThe whole of the edifice is of one period, and dates from the second\r\nquarter of the twelfth century. Its most striking feature is a massive\r\ntower, surmounted by a battlemented turret of later date. The richly\r\ncarved woodwork of Restoration date is interesting. In the east wall of\r\nthe nave is a monumental brass, and a stone slab in the floor of the\r\ntower commemorates the death of Elizabeth Naunton, Prioress of Neasham,\r\n1488-89.\r\n\r\nThe only medieval pulpit in the county is in the Church of St. Michael\r\nat Heighington. It is of oak, and carved with the linen pattern design\r\nand flowing tracery, with an inscription on the cornice.\r\n\r\nThe church dates from the twelfth century, and considerable remains of\r\nthat date still exist.\r\n\r\nAt Aycliffe, the Church of St. Andrew is substantially a building of\r\nNorman date. It now consists of a chancel, nave with north and south\r\naisles, south porch, and western tower, the latter and the south aisle\r\ndating from the beginning of the thirteenth century. Remains of several\r\npre-Conquest crosses are in the church and churchyard.\r\n\r\nGainford Church, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, is all of one period,\r\nand with a few exceptions dates from the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. It contains several interesting brasses. The same may be said\r\nof the Church of St. Edwin at Coniscliffe, which has a very interesting\r\ncarved slab above the south door.\r\n\r\nThe Church of All Saints at Hurworth contains several effigies, but was\r\nalmost entirely rebuilt in 1870. The Church of St. Mary at Egglescliffe\r\nhas portions of Early Norman date, but the chancel dates from the later\r\nPerpendicular period, and has a fine east window of five lights. On the\r\nsouth side of the nave is a fourteenth-century chapel, with a sepulchral\r\neffigy of a man in rich armour in a niche in the outer wall.\r\n\r\nSt. Cuthbert at Redmarshall is a modest structure, but contains two\r\ninteresting alabaster effigies of Thomas de Langton and Sybil, his wife,\r\nplaced in a fifteenth-century chantry chapel on the south side of the\r\nnave.\r\n\r\nBoth Norton and Billingham contain churches of great interest. The\r\nformer has portions of pre-Conquest date, and was one of the churches to\r\nwhich William de St. Carileph removed the monks of Durham in 1083. The\r\nchurch, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, contains a nave and side\r\naisles, chancel, north and south porches, and central tower. The latter\r\noriginally rose no higher than the ridges of the main roofs, and formed\r\na chamber, the floor of which has been removed. Beneath the tower is a\r\nvery fine effigy of a knight in chain armour, surmounted by a crocketed\r\ncanopy. The chancel was rebuilt in the thirteenth century, and the upper\r\nstage of the tower is probably of the same period.\r\n\r\nAt Billingham the church is dedicated to St. Cuthbert. The tower is of\r\npre-Conquest date, and has certain points of resemblance to the higher\r\nstage of that at St. Peter’s, Monkwearmouth. Several fragments of\r\npre-Conquest crosses are built into the south wall of the tower, and the\r\nchurch has three memorial brasses.\r\n\r\nIn Durham City, St. Oswald’s, the parish church of Elvet, has a\r\nwell-recorded history, and was the subject of an amusing dispute between\r\nthe Bishop Philip de Pictavia and the Prior and monks of Durham, arising\r\nfrom a charter\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTON CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nof Henry II. confirming to the latter \"Elvet, with the church of the\r\nsame town.\"\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Philip--the last vicar, Richard de Coldingham,\r\nhaving recently died--\r\n\r\n     \"Four of the monks from St. Cuthbert’s held possession of the\r\n     church, and lived constantly in it.\r\n\r\n     \"The Bishop ... issued a command that the monks should quit the\r\n     church. This they refused to do; whereupon the Bishop employed as\r\n     many as thirty watchmen, who guarded all the doors and windows, so\r\n     that no food should reach the monks in the church. After two or\r\n     three days, two of the monks could endure the fast no longer, and\r\n     abandoned their charge. Their example was shortly followed by the\r\n     others.... Four days were occupied by negotiations, at the end of\r\n     which the Bishop confirmed the possession of the church to them\r\n     ‘for their own proper uses.’\"--BOYLE.\r\n\r\nThe church is of various periods, and has a very good clerestory with a\r\nfine open-work parapet, and a tower of more than ordinary interest, with\r\na stone staircase in the thickness of the wall, roofed with thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth century grave-covers.\r\n\r\nSt. Margaret’s and St. Giles’s are two city churches of interest. Both\r\nhave several pre-Reformation bells, and of the latter--\r\n\r\n     \"an interesting fact in the history of this church is that St.\r\n     Godric, during the period he resided in Durham, was an attendant at\r\n     its services, and at length became doorkeeper and\r\n     bellringer.\"--BOYLE.\r\n\r\nPittington Church, dedicated to St. Lawrence, is one of the most\r\ninteresting churches in the central district of the county. Portions of\r\nthe western bays of the nave are of Norman date. In the twelfth century\r\ngreat structural alterations were made to the original church, which had\r\nconsisted of a nave and chancel only. The tower belongs to this period,\r\nand the wonderful north arcade pierced through the original north wall\r\nof the nave. The arcading of the wall forms four bays, and a fifth was\r\nbuilt as an elongation to the east, the original chancel being taken\r\ndown and rebuilt. The pillars are alternately cylindrical, ornamented\r\nwith spiral bands, and octagonal with flutings. The arches are of two\r\norders, ornamented towards the nave with chevron mouldings, and resting\r\non octagonal cushioned capitals. During the thirteenth century the\r\nchurch was enlarged by a south aisle being built. The tower arch is also\r\nof this period. The date of the clerestory is uncertain. In 1846 the\r\nchancel was taken down, and the south aisle entirely, and north aisle\r\npartly, rebuilt, and the nave again lengthened. In the splays of an\r\nearly window in the north wall of the nave are remains of two wall\r\npaintings.\r\n\r\n     \"They are undoubtedly portions of a complete series of paintings\r\n     occupying the whole interior of the first Norman church.... They\r\n     represent two incidents in the life of St. Cuthbert--viz., his\r\n     consecration by Archbishop Theodore, and his vision at the table of\r\n     the Abbess Ælfleda....\"--FOWLER.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting grave-cover in the floor beneath the tower,\r\nbearing an inscription to the memory of Christian the Mason, a\r\ncontemporary of Bishop Pudsey. Also an effigy attributed to the family\r\nof Fitz-Marmaduke, Lords of Horden, and several interesting monumental\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nAll the bells, three in number, are of pre-Reformation date.\r\n\r\nThe important Church of St. Michael at Houghton-le-Spring dates almost\r\nentirely from the thirteenth century, but stands on the site of a much\r\nearlier erection, of which a portion still remains in the north wall of\r\nthe chancel, containing a square-headed doorway and round-headed window.\r\nThe church, as now existing, consists of a chancel with north and south\r\ntransepts, nave with north and south aisles, south porch, and central\r\ntower. In the north wall of the chancel is an arcade of eight lancets,\r\nmuch restored, and opening from the south side is an unusual\r\ntwo-storeyed erection, which, it is presumed, had some connection with\r\nthe ancient Gild of Holy Trinity and St. Mary, established in the church\r\nin 1476.\r\n\r\nThe windows in the gables of the transepts are modern. In the east wall\r\nof the south transept are three tall lancets and two in the\r\ncorresponding wall of the north transept. In a recess in the south wall\r\nof the former is a roughly carved and much-weathered effigy of a man in\r\narmour, dating from the thirteenth century, and a similar effigy of\r\nlater date and superior workmanship lies in the same transept, together\r\nwith the altar-tomb of Bernard Gilpin, \"the apostle of the North,\" and a\r\nbrass to the memory of Margery, wife of Richard Bellasis of Henknoll,\r\ndated 1587. Both the transepts contained chantry chapels before the\r\nReformation, and in both are piscinas in the usual position.\r\n\r\nThe arcading of the nave is very fine, and supported on clustered piers.\r\nThe east and west windows are Decorated insertions and contain good\r\ntracery. The lower stage of the tower and its supporting arches are\r\ncontemporary with the main body of the church, the upper stage is modern\r\nand with the present spire replaced the ancient spire of wood.\r\n\r\nAt Dalton, the Church of St. Andrew, is a very simple structure, but\r\ncontains an unusual sundial, consisting of carved stone figures on the\r\ninside of the north wall of the nave, upon which the time is marked by a\r\nsunbeam passing through a window.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary’s, Easington, has suffered much at the hands of restorers, but\r\nstill remains a most interesting church. The whole of the present\r\nedifice, with the exception of the tower, which is of Norman work, dates\r\nfrom the thirteenth century. The nave is separated from its aisle by\r\nfour pointed arches on either side resting on piers, alternately\r\noctagonal and cylindrical. The clerestory is good and has four lancet\r\nwindows on each side. With the exception of the original round-headed\r\nwindows in the tower, all the windows are restorations. The present\r\nentrance is at the south of the tower, the original entrance to the nave\r\nhaving been built up. The woodwork of the chancel is interesting. There\r\nare two fine male and female effigies of the Fitz-Marmaduke family in\r\nthe chancel, but their identity is uncertain. They date from the latter\r\npart of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the north-eastern quarter of the county there are the churches of\r\nJarrow and Monkwearmouth already referred to, and several other edifices\r\nof ancient foundation, but so much restored and modernized as to retain\r\nfew of their original features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOLDON SPIRE.]\r\n\r\nThis may be said of the church at Whitburn, which contains a peculiar\r\nseventeenth-century monumental effigy in wood. The Church of St.\r\nNicholas at West Boldon occupies a lofty site on the side of a hill, and\r\nis visible for many miles over Jarrow and the low land round Hedworth.\r\nThe oldest portions date from the beginning of the thirteenth century.\r\nIn January, 1906, the nave and chancel roofs were destroyed by fire, and\r\nseveral of the monumental inscriptions badly scorched. The Church of St.\r\nHilda, at South Shields, occupies a site of great antiquity, but was\r\nentirely rebuilt in 1810.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Mary, Gateshead, is of more general interest, but has\r\nbeen greatly restored. The tower was rebuilt in 1740. The roof of the\r\nnave is good, and of Perpendicular date. Several pre-Reformation\r\ngrave-covers are built into the walls, two of special interest being in\r\nthe porch. A number of quaint extracts from the parish books are given\r\nby Surtees:\r\n\r\n     1632. Paid for whipping black Barborie 6d.\r\n\r\n     1649. Paid at Mris Watsons, when the Justices sate to examin the\r\n     witches ¾; for a grave for a witch 6d; for trying the witches £1.\r\n     5. 0.\r\n\r\n     1671. Paid for powder and match when the Keelemen mutinyed 2/-.\r\n\r\n     1684. For carrying 26 Quakers to Durham £2. 17s.\r\n\r\nIn the north-west of the county, Ryton Church (Holy Cross), dates from\r\nthe thirteenth century, and is all of one period. It consists of a\r\nchancel, nave with north and south aisles, western tower with spire, and\r\nsouth porch. In the chancel is a square-headed piscina in the usual\r\nposition, a priest’s doorway, and a low side-window, now built up. In\r\nthe north wall is an ambry. The arcades of the nave are of three arches\r\neach, the easternmost pillars on each side being octagonal, the others\r\ncylindrical. The corbel-table of the tower is of interest, several of\r\nthe corbels being carved in foliage designs. The wooden, lead-covered\r\nspire is contemporary with the tower. Within the altar-rails is a fine\r\nsepulchral effigy in marble of a deacon.\r\n\r\nReturning again to the central districts, the Church of St. Mary and St.\r\nCuthbert at Chester-le-Street is the successor of an early wooden\r\nedifice, which sheltered for the greater part of two centuries the\r\nremains of the latter saint, before the Danish invasion of 995 caused\r\nhis guardians--for better security--to remove their charge to Ripon.\r\nEgelric, fourth Bishop of Durham, decided to rebuild the church of\r\nstone, but it is doubtful if any remains of his church are incorporated\r\nin the present building. The date of the erection of the latter is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe oldest portions of the present church are the north and south walls\r\nof the chancel, and in the south wall are inserted three windows, dating\r\nfrom the thirteenth century, and evidently contemporary with the three\r\neastern bays of the arcade of the nave. The remaining bays of the nave\r\nand the tower are later additions, and the graceful spire still later,\r\ndating from the Early Decorated period.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Reformation there were two chantries in the church,\r\none being in the south aisle, at the east end of which there is a\r\ntrefoil-headed piscina and square ambry. At the west end of the north\r\naisle, partly within and partly without the church, is an interesting\r\ntwo-storied erection, containing four chambers, which must have, at one\r\ntime, been an anchorage. The church is chiefly remarkable for the series\r\nof fourteen monumental effigies of presumed members of the Lumley\r\nfamily. Eleven, however, were the work of sculptors employed by John,\r\nLord Lumley, at the end of the sixteenth century, and two were removed\r\nby him from the graveyard of Durham Abbey, under the mistaken impression\r\nthat they represented two of his ancestors.\r\n\r\n     \"The first effigy, evidently imaginary, represents Liulph in a coat\r\n     of mail.... Above this venerable personage is a long inscription\r\n     commemorating the whole family descent.\r\n\r\n     \"Next to Liulph lies Uchtred, in a suit of chain armour....\r\n\r\n     \"The third effigy, William, son of Uchtred, who first assumed the\r\n     Lumley name, is probably genuine. He appears in a full suit of\r\n     chain armour, over which is a surcoat, with the drapery hanging in\r\n     easy folds below the girdle. The legs are crossed, and rest on a\r\n     lion. A shield on the left arm. The head rests on a cushion.\r\n\r\n     \"The second William de Lumley appears in plate of a much less\r\n     genuine description....\r\n\r\n     \"And the third William is like unto him, save that his legs be\r\n     straight and his hair wantonly crisped.\r\n\r\n     \"And Roger is like William, but sore mutilated.\r\n\r\n     \"Robert de Lumley, extremely like Roger....\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Marmaduke Lumley, in mail....\r\n\r\n     \"Ralph, first Baron Lumley ... one of those removed from the\r\n     cemetery of the Cathedral Church of Durham, a close coat of mail,\r\n     the visor ribbed down the front with two transverse slits for the\r\n     sight, the breast covered with the shield, the sword unsheathed and\r\n     upright, the point resting against the visor, the legs straight,\r\n     resting on a couchant hound.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir John Lumley, almost minutely resembling the last.\r\n\r\n     \"George Lord Lumley. An effigy, recumbent like his predecessors....\r\n     The dress is probably intended for the robes of the baron.\r\n\r\n     \" ... Sir Thomas Lumley, Knight. The figure is in mail....\r\n\r\n     \"Richard, Lord Lumley....\r\n\r\n     \"The last effigy, John, Lord Lumley, in robes....\"--SURTEES.\r\n\r\nIn the church is also a thirteenth-century effigy of a bishop,\r\nrepresenting St. Cuthbert.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary the Virgin, Lanchester, is a very interesting church, and has\r\nportions of Norman date. It consists of a chancel, nave with north and\r\nsouth aisles, and south porch, western tower, and a vestry. The chancel\r\ndates from the thirteenth century, and there is a very fine piscina in\r\nits south wall. The chancel arch dates from the middle of the twelfth\r\ncentury. The vestry opens from the chancel by a very fine doorway, with\r\na cinquefoil arch. The arcades of the nave have four bays on either\r\nside, with cylindrical pillars and pointed arches. The south aisle and\r\nporch date from the beginning, and the north aisle from the end, of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere is a brass in the chancel to the memory of John Rudd, and an\r\neffigy of a priest lies in a recess in the south aisle. During the\r\nepiscopacy of Bishop Bek the church was made collegiate with a Dean and\r\nseven Prebendaries, and portions of the woodwork of their stalls are\r\nstill preserved.\r\n\r\nThe church at Brancepeth (St. Brandon) has parts dating from the\r\nthirteenth century, and is an interesting edifice. The panelling and\r\ngeneral internal fittings of the church are of a most elaborate nature.\r\nOver the chancel arch is some remarkable screen work, carved in oak and\r\npainted white. The chancel screen and stalls date from the time of John\r\nCosin, who was rector of Brancepeth before being raised to the Bishopric\r\nin 1661, but have the appearance, in common with much of his work at\r\nDurham Castle, of belonging to a much earlier period.\r\n\r\nThere are several sepulchral effigies to members of the Neville family\r\nin the church.\r\n\r\nSt. Michael’s, Bishop Middleham, is a thirteenth-century church and all\r\nof one period. Whitworth church was entirely rebuilt in 1850, and is\r\nonly interesting for the remarkable male and female sepulchral effigies\r\nin the churchyard.\r\n\r\nAt Bishop Auckland, St. Helen’s has a chancel arch and two bays of the\r\narcades of the nave of Late Transitional work, a very short period\r\nseparating them from the western bays of the nave. The chancel is of\r\nthirteenth-century date, and the aisles are prolonged to engage the\r\ngreater part of it, forming chantry chapels. The clerestory has three\r\ntwo-light, Late Perpendicular windows on each side, and at the west end\r\nis a round-headed window of earlier date, but evidently an insertion in\r\nits present position. The east window consists of three lancets under\r\none arch, the spandrel spaces being pierced. The south doorway is of\r\nPerpendicular date, and the porch, a later addition, has in common with\r\nSt. Andrew’s, Auckland, a chamber above. There is a brass of\r\nfifteenth-century date in the church.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Andrew’s, Auckland, is a fitting edifice to close this\r\nbrief account of the parish churches of Durham. Its site has from the\r\nearliest times of Christianity in the North been occupied by a church,\r\nand there is strong evidence that it was the home of a collegiate body\r\nformed of monks removed from Durham by Bishop William de St. Carileph.\r\nThis establishment was reorganized by Bishop Bek in 1292, and great\r\nalterations were made in the fabric of the church at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe church consists of a chancel, north and south transepts, nave with\r\nnorth and south aisles, and western tower. It dates from the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and there is evidence that it succeeded a building of Norman\r\ndate, which was itself either an enlargement of, or a successor to, the\r\nfirst building.\r\n\r\nThe church has many points of great interest, and perhaps the most\r\nstriking features of the interior are the arcades of the nave. These are\r\nof five bays each, with richly moulded arches, resting on alternate\r\noctagonal and clustered piers. The north transept was almost entirely\r\nrebuilt during restoration, but the new work is a copy of the old,\r\nwhich, however, did not date from the original church, but was one of\r\nthe alterations of Bishop Bek, before referred to. The east wall of the\r\nchancel is also his work. In 1417 a higher stage was added to the tower,\r\nand the clerestory of the nave is of still later date.\r\n\r\nThe chancel stalls are the work of Cardinal Langley and very effective.\r\nThere are two monumental effigies in the church, one of a Knight in\r\narmour, the other of a lady; both apparently date from the end of the\r\nfourteenth century. There are also three brasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS OF THE COUNTY OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY EDWIN DODDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest-known burial-place in the county of Durham has no\r\nmonumental inscriptions in it. It is a barrow opened at Copt Hill, near\r\nHoughton-le-Spring, which contained Neolithic remains, and it is\r\ninteresting inasmuch as it has also vestiges of burials made again after\r\nthe lapse of many years, when the Bronze Age had superseded the period\r\nin which men warred and worked with weapons of stone only. There is no\r\nmemento known of the Paleolithic Age in the county, and only thirteen\r\nplaces of burial used by Neolithic man have been investigated. Of the\r\nBronze Age about a dozen burial-places have been examined, many of them\r\ncontaining those small rudely fashioned earthenware vessels, from three\r\nto six inches high, roughly ornamented with simple lines and dots, which\r\nare known as \"food-vessels\" and \"incense-cups.\"\r\n\r\nOf the monumental inscriptions left by the Romans, two of the most\r\ninteresting were found near the Roman station in South Shields. One of\r\nthem is an elaborately carved slab, four feet long, which bears the\r\nfigure of a woman seated, with a work-basket at her left hand and a\r\njewel-case at her right; she seems to be occupied in needlework. Below\r\nis the Latin inscription: \"To the Divine Shades of Regina, of the\r\nCatuallaunian Tribe, a freed woman, and the wife of Barates the\r\nPalmyrene. She lived thirty years.\" Below this is a line in Syriac:\r\n\"Regina, the freed woman of Barate. Alas!\" The district of Catuallauna\r\nis said to have extended from Gloucestershire to Lincolnshire. It is\r\nstrange that affinity of souls should have brought together as man and\r\nwife a merchant from Syria and a slave from the centre of England.\r\nAnother Roman gravestone from South Shields, found in 1885, reads: \"To\r\nthe Divine Shades of Victor. He was by nation a Moor: he lived twenty\r\nyears: and was the freed man of Numerianus, a horseman of the first ala\r\nof Asturians, who most affectionately followed [his former servant to\r\nthe grave].\" This stone probably dates from about A.D. 275; it bears the\r\nhalf-recumbent figure of a man on a couch, with a canopy above and the\r\ninscription below. At Binchester, near Bishop Auckland--the Vinovia of\r\nthe Romans--a plain slab with ansated ends was found inscribed: \"Sacred\r\nto the Divine Shades. Nemesius Montanus the Decurion lived forty years.\r\nNemesius Sanctus, his brother, and his coheirs, erected this in\r\naccordance with the provisions of his will.\" This slab was also probably\r\ncarved and set up in the third century. In Roman epitaphs no mention of\r\ndeath is ever made; it is stated that the person commemorated had lived\r\nso many years, but the fact that he died and the date of his death is\r\nnot recorded.\r\n\r\nOf Anglo-Saxon memorial crosses there are a large number in the county\r\nof Durham, all of them of great interest, and some of beautiful\r\nworkmanship. The most notable are those at Aycliffe, Billingham,\r\nChester-le-Street, Coniscliffe, Darlington, Dinsdale, Durham (where, in\r\nthe Dean and Chapter Library, there is a fine collection both of\r\noriginal stones from several places and of facsimile copies), Elwick,\r\nEscomb, Gainford, Great Stainton, Haughton-le-Skerne, Hurworth, Kelloe,\r\nNorton, Sockburn, and Winston-on-the-Tees. None of them are perfect;\r\nmost of them are fragments of monuments which have at some time been\r\nbroken up and used as building stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGLO-SAXON STONE AT CHESTER-LE-STREET.]\r\n\r\nThe cross at Kelloe is made up of pieces now carefully joined together;\r\nit is a very fine example. Most of these crosses have the characteristic\r\nknot-work ornament, and many of them have human figures, crucifixions,\r\nmonsters, warriors, animals, and birds, carved upon them, the sculpture\r\nand design being of the Anglian school. Very few of them have any\r\nlettering. One at Chester-le-Street has EADMUND in mixed Runic and Roman\r\nletters, but this may be an addition by a later hand. The hog-backed\r\nstones of this period, of which some very fine specimens were discovered\r\nat Sockburn in 1900, bear similar knot-work ornaments. In 1833 a\r\nburial-place at Hartlepool, and in 1834 one at Monkwearmouth, were\r\ndiscovered; they both yielded memorial stones, small in size, but of\r\ngreat interest. A stone from the latter place, now in the British\r\nMuseum, bears the name TIDFIRTH in Runic characters. Tidfirth was the\r\nlast Bishop of Hexham, and was deposed about the year 821. The stones\r\nfound at Hartlepool are known as pillow-stones; they are almost square,\r\nand only from 9 to 12 inches across by about 2 inches thick. Only seven\r\nof them have been saved. They all bear a cross, sunk in some stones and\r\nraised on others, and several of them have short inscriptions in Saxon\r\nminuscules. One reads: \"ORATE PRO EDILUINI ORATE PRO UERMUND ET\r\nTORTHSUID.\"\r\n\r\nThose effigies, or early statues, generally recumbent, and made\r\nsometimes of wood, but more often of stone, which were placed in\r\nchurches from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, are to be found in\r\nmany places in the county, sometimes decently and carefully preserved in\r\nthe church, sometimes left to weather and decay in the churchyard, or in\r\nthe rectory garden. Among the more noticeable of them are the following:\r\n\r\nAt the west end of Staindrop Church is the \"altar-tomb of alabaster,\"\r\nwith an effigy of Ralph Neville, first Earl of Westmorland, in plate\r\narmour, and with figures of his two wives, one on either hand. Surtees,\r\nin his _History of Durham_, describes it as \"this noble tomb, which is\r\nin the purest style of the best age of sepulchral monuments.\" Its date\r\nis probably about 1425. There is in the same church another tomb with\r\neffigies, in wood, of the fifth Earl of Westmorland and his two wives;\r\nit is dated 1560.\r\n\r\nBarnard Castle Church has an effigy of a priest attired in chasuble,\r\nstole, dalmatic, alb, and amice. The inscription is in Lombardic\r\nlettering, and reads: \"ORATE PRO AIA ROBERTI DE MORTHAM QNDM VICARII DE\r\nGAYNFORD.\" This Robert de Mortham founded a chantry at Barnard Castle in\r\n1339.\r\n\r\nAt Bishopwearmouth there was formerly the effigy of Thomas Middleton of\r\nChillingham, the founder of the family of Silksworth. It represented\r\nMiddleton in complete armour, with his hands raised. It bore the\r\ninscription: \"Hic jacet Thom’ Middylton Armiger -- -- -- MCCC.\" At one time\r\nthis statue lay on an altar-tomb in the north aisle of the church; later\r\nit was placed upright against the wall of the aisle; later, again, it is\r\nrecorded that it lay, broken into two pieces, in the porch; to-day it\r\ncannot be found.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of St. Giles, in the city of Durham, there is a wooden\r\neffigy in complete armour, which is supposed to represent the first\r\nJohn Heath, of Kepier, who was buried in the chancel of that church in\r\n1590.\r\n\r\nThe Lumley monuments are a collection of fourteen effigies which lie in\r\nthe north aisle of Chester-le-Street Church. They were placed there by a\r\nLord Lumley about 1594. They represent the Lords of Lumley from Liulph,\r\nwho lived in the days of William the Conqueror, down to the John, Lord\r\nLumley, who fought at Flodden Field in 1513. Probably only three of the\r\nfourteen monuments are genuine; the others were either manufactured or,\r\nmore probably, collected from other places.\r\n\r\nThe old chapel at Greatham was pulled down in 1788. In a recess in the\r\nsouth wall of the transept there was a wooden effigy of an ecclesiastic.\r\nDuring the rebuilding of the chapel a stone coffin containing his bones\r\nand a chalice of pewter was found near the foot of the wall.\r\n\r\nIn the Pespoole seats in the south aisle of Easington Church there is an\r\nelegant recumbent figure of a woman, carved in Stanhope marble. On it\r\nare carved the three popinjays which were carried on the coat of arms of\r\nthe ancient owners of Horden. At Heighington Church there are two female\r\neffigies, one of which has been very fine, but they are both much\r\nweathered and decayed; they are probably of fourteenth-century date. In\r\nthe same church there is a medieval pulpit, the only one remaining in\r\nthe county. It is of oak, and on it there is inscribed in black letter:\r\n\"<f>orate p’ aiabz Alexandri flessehar et agnetis uxoris sue</f>.\" To\r\ncommemorate oneself by giving a pulpit to the church seems a practical\r\nand useful form of memorial. As this is the only medieval pulpit the\r\ncounty has left, it seems likely that its preservation is due to the\r\ninscription it bears.\r\n\r\nWhen Neasham Abbey, in the north of Yorkshire, fell into ruin, two of\r\nits effigies were moved over the Tees to the church at Hurworth. One of\r\nthem was a remarkably fine figure of a knight in armour, his head\r\ncovered with a coat of mail, his body clad in a shirt of mail, over\r\nwhich there is a surcoat. His shield has \"barry of eight, three\r\nchaplets of roses.\" The armour is of the style in use in the early part\r\nof the fourteenth century, and the effigy probably represents the Robert\r\nFitzWilliam who was Warden of the Marches in the time of the just King\r\nEdward I., and who died in 1316.\r\n\r\nIn Lanchester Church, under an arch in the wall of the south aisle, lies\r\na recumbent effigy of a canon secular, his raised hands clasping a\r\nchalice. This is believed to represent Stephen Austell, Dean of\r\nLanchester, who died in 1464. In Monkwearmouth Church, under a canopy\r\nwhich bears the shields of the Hiltons and Viponds, there is a very\r\ninteresting effigy of a knight in plate armour of the early part of the\r\nfifteenth century. This is probably the Baron William Hilton, who built\r\nHilton Castle on the Wear, with its wonderful armorial front. He died in\r\n1435. At Norton, near Stockton, there is a magnificent effigy of a\r\nknight in chain armour; over the head there is a rich canopy of\r\ntabernacle-work; the hands are raised and the legs are crossed, the feet\r\nresting on a lion. It is sometimes assumed that this representation of a\r\nknight with his legs crossed one over the other indicates that the\r\nperson portrayed was a Crusader, but there are many cases where the\r\nattitude is used in which it is known that the effigy was that of one\r\nwho could not have taken any part in those Holy Wars. This monument is\r\nfurther noticeable as it is one of the very few which give us even a\r\nslight hint as to the personality of the sculptor; it bears what is\r\nbelieved to be his mark in the shape of a small squiggle, which looks\r\nlike a short length of chain, in front of which is the letter \"I,\" and\r\nit is supposed that this punning rebus means that the effigy is the\r\nhandiwork of one John Cheyne. It would be very interesting to know who\r\ncommissioned Cheyne to carve this monument, for another curious feature\r\nin it is that the shield of the knight bears six coats of\r\narms--Blakeston, Surtees, Bowes, Dalden, Conyers, and Conyers--which\r\nmean that the knight was a Blakeston of Blakeston. But the Blakestons\r\nbore these arms in the sixteenth century, probably not later than the\r\nyear 1587, whereas the armour of the effigy is of the time of Edward I.,\r\n1272-1307. Boyle suggests that probably the monument is to one of the De\r\nParks, and that a Blakeston took it, scraped off the De Park arms, and\r\nput on his own coat. Whatever its vicissitudes may have been, it remains\r\na noble piece of work.\r\n\r\nIn Redmarshall Church, in the Claxton Porch, there are effigies of\r\nThomas Langton de Wynyard and of Sibil Langton, his wife. They are\r\nadmirably carved in a rather soft alabaster, and the delicacy and\r\nclearness of detail in the costumes is very remarkable. The lady’s hair\r\nis dressed in the extraordinary horns which were fashionable in the days\r\nof Henry V. She wears a long, loose kirtle, with a surcoat and mantle;\r\nround her neck is a string of pearls, and round her waist is a jewelled\r\nbelt. The knight wears a suit of plate armour, probably of Italian make,\r\nthe fashion of which suggests that the effigy was carved several years\r\nafter the death of Thomas de Langton in 1440.\r\n\r\nEffigies of men who had devoted themselves to a religious life, but who\r\ndied before attaining the order of priesthood, are very rare. There is\r\none of a deacon within the altar-rails of Ryton Church, carved in green\r\nmarble from Stanhope.\r\n\r\nWhitburn Church holds a singular effigy of comparatively late date.\r\nAttired in the full stiff dress of the time of William and Mary lies a\r\nplump, elderly gentleman. He wears a full periwig, a neckcloth with\r\nsquare ends, a coat with large buckramed skirts and wide sleeves, rolled\r\nbreeches, and square-toed laced shoes ornamented with immense bows of\r\nribbon. His head rests on a pillow, and his right hand holds a book,\r\nwhich is open at the text, \"I shall not lye here, but rise.\" There is a\r\nskull between the feet. On the uprights of the tomb the same figure is\r\ncarved in bas-relief, kneeling, and on each side of him is a lady in\r\nthe dress of the same period. A tablet on the wall states that this is\r\n\"the burial-place of Mr. Michael Mathew of Cleadon, and his wife, who\r\nhad issue three sons and two daughters, of which only Hannah survives.\"\r\n\r\nBRASSES.--In many of the older churches of the county there are\r\nremaining the stone matrices which formerly held monumental brasses, but\r\nin most cases the brasses themselves have disappeared, the sanctity of a\r\nchurch, and the contiguity of a Table of the Ten Commandments not having\r\nprevailed against the temptation to steal a substance so portable and so\r\nreadily saleable as brass.\r\n\r\nIn the floor of the chapel at Greatham Hospital there is a large slab of\r\nstone, 90 by 43 inches in size, with an inscription in brass Lombardic\r\nletters round the edge commemorating William de Middleton, a master of\r\nthe Hospital in 1312. On the wall is another inscription, in raised\r\nblack-letter with chasing, asking for prayers for the souls of Nicholas\r\nHulme, who was master in 1427, of John Kelyng, 1463, and of William\r\nEstfelde, who died in 1497.\r\n\r\nAt Sherburn Hospital there is a small brass let into the chancel steps,\r\nwhich reads: \"THOMAS . LEAVER . PREACHER . TO KING EDWARD . THE . SIXTE.\r\nHE . DIED . iN . iVLY . i577.\"\r\n\r\nIn the church at St. Andrew’s Auckland there is a finely cut brass with\r\nthe figure of a priest, of which the head is, unfortunately, missing.\r\nThere is no inscription, but the date of it is probably about 1400. In\r\nthe same church there is a unique brass, small in size, but about ½ inch\r\nthick; it bears a small Greek cross with a backing of plant decoration,\r\nand it has three lines of inscription across the plate and a legend\r\nround the margin. It is dated April 8, 1581, and was put up to the\r\nmemory of Mrs. Fridesmond Barnes, who was the wife of the second\r\nProtestant Bishop of Durham, Richard Barnes. We know the cost of this\r\nbrass, for in the Bishop’s accounts there is the entry, \"To the\r\ngould-smyth at Yorke for a plate to sett over Mrs. Barnes, 32ˢ.\"\r\n\r\nAt St. Helen’s Auckland there is a brass which portrays the figure of a\r\nman in a long tunic edged with fur; his wife lies by his side, and below\r\nare figures of his sons and daughters. The inscription is lost, but the\r\ndate of it is probably about 1460.\r\n\r\nIn Sedgefield Church there is a curious brass giving the crest of\r\nWilliam Hoton, 1445, with a black-letter inscription below: \"<f>Hic iacet\r\nwill[=m]s Hoton . qui . obijt . xviº die Septebr’ Anno . dni . Mill[=m]o .\r\nECCCº . xlvº . cui’ aie ppicietur de’ ame’</f>.\" In the same church there are\r\ntwo of the objectionable brasses which were not uncommon in the\r\nfifteenth century, which portrayed skeletons in shrouds.\r\n\r\nChester-le-Street Church has a very pleasing brass, giving the\r\nfull-length figure of a woman attired in the costume of the first half\r\nof the fifteenth century. The lines of the composition are simple and\r\nbold, and the effect is very graceful. The brass has no inscription, but\r\nit is known that it was put up to the memory of Alice Salcock of Salcock\r\nin Yorkshire, who married William Lambton, and who died in 1434.\r\n\r\nAt Dinsdale, on the southern margin of the county, close to the River\r\nTees, there is in the church a late, small, but beautifully worked\r\nbrass, only about 11 inches by 8 inches in size. It bears the coat of\r\narms of eight quarterings, and records the merciful benefactions to the\r\npoor of the parish of Dinsdale of Mary, the wife of Thomas Spennithorne.\r\nShe died in 1668, and was buried at Spennithorne.\r\n\r\nIn the magnificent cathedral of Durham most of the sepulchral monuments\r\nwere destroyed either at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the reign\r\nof Henry VIII., or when the cathedral church was used as a prison for\r\nScotch prisoners of war after the Battle of Dunbar in 1650. In 1671\r\nDavies wrote his book on _The Rites and Monuments of the Church of\r\nDurham_, with the motto _Tempora mutantur_--on the title-page, giving a\r\nsad description of the past glories of the church. \"Lodovic de bello\r\nMonte, Bishop of Durham,\" he says, \"lieth buried before the high Altar\r\nin the Quire, under a most curious and sumptuous Marble stone, which he\r\nprepar’d for himself, before he died, being adorned with most excellent\r\nworkmanship of Brass, wherein he was most excellently and lively\r\nPictur’d, as he was accustomed to sing, or say Mass.\" This Bishop de\r\nbello Monte, or Beaumont, died at Brantingham, near Hull, in 1333. His\r\ngravestone, which was said to be the largest in England, still lies\r\nbefore the high-altar in Durham Cathedral, but the \"most excellent\r\nworkmanship of Brass\" has utterly disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn Hartlepool Church there is a brass with the figure of a lady in a\r\nlarge hat, with ruff and farthingale; on another brass below it is the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n    HERE VNDER THiS STONE LYETH BVRiED THE BODiE OF THE\r\n    VERTVOUS GENTELLWOMAN IANE BELL, WHO DEPTED THiS LYFE THE\r\n    . vi. DAYE OF IANVARIE 1593 BEiNGE THE DOWGHTER OF LAVERANCE\r\n    THORNELL OF DARLINGTON GENT & LATE WYFE TO PARSAVAL\r\n    BELL, NOWE MAiRE OF THIS TOWEN OF HARTiNPOOELL. MARCHANT\r\n\r\n         whos vertues if thou wilt beholde\r\n           peruse this tabel hanginge bye\r\n         which will the same to thee vnfold\r\n           by her good lyfe learne thou to die.\r\n\r\nIn Haughton-le-Skerne Church there is a curious figure on a brass,\r\nrepresenting a lady, who holds a baby on each arm. She was Dorothy, the\r\nwife of Robert Perkinson of Whessey, and she died, with her twin sons,\r\nin 1592.\r\n\r\nAt Houghton-le-Spring there is a brass to the memory of Margery, wife of\r\nRichard Bellasis. It pictures the kneeling figure of a woman with her\r\neight sons and three daughters behind her. The Bellasis coat of arms is\r\non the brass: the date is 1587.\r\n\r\nIn Sedgefield Church there is a rudely engraved, early brass, probably\r\ncut about the year 1300. It shows a small female figure, kneeling, and\r\nit has a coat of arms on both sides of the figure. From the shape of\r\nthe two coats of arms, and from the conventional treatment of the\r\nfeatures of the face, which is more carefully executed than the rest of\r\nthe figure, it is believed that this is one of the oldest sepulchral\r\nbrasses now remaining in England.\r\n\r\nThe tombstone to Dean Rudde, which lies in the floor of the chancel of\r\nSedgefield Church, still carries its inscribed brass. The stone is a\r\nvery large one. The black-letter epitaph is so much worn by the tread of\r\nthe feet of many generations that it can only be read with some\r\nuncertainty. It seems to run:\r\n\r\n     <f>Orate p aīa [=m]ri Jo[=h]is Rudde in decretis baccalarii quond[=m]\r\n     decani hui’ loci qui obiit xxix die decēbr’ Anno d[=n]i Mº CCCCº\r\n     lxxxx cui’ āīē ppiciet de’ amen.</f>\r\n\r\nThis John Rudde gave to the church of Esh the only medieval service-book\r\nbelonging to any church in the diocese of Durham which is now known to\r\nexist. It is in the library of the Roman Catholic College of Ushaw, near\r\nDurham.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful memorials to the dead which were known as grave-covers\r\nwere used in England and Ireland from the ninth to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Though they are abundant in the county, Durham cannot boast of\r\nthe possession of specimens equal in merit to those found in some\r\nother parts of England. At Sedgefield Church there is a fine\r\nthirteenth-century grave-cover with a double, eight-rayed cross; it has\r\nthe rare feature of a double row of dog-tooth ornament at the head; and\r\nit is the only stone known in the county which has the whole surface\r\ncovered with a tracery of foliage. It is, unfortunately, much weathered.\r\nBuilt into the tower of the same church, and only partly visible, is\r\nanother richly ornamented cover, dating probably from the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, the foliated ornament being more naturally shown, or\r\nless conventionalized, than in earlier examples. It bears a sword and a\r\ncross moline on a small shield.\r\n\r\nThe symbolism used on grave-covers is not well understood. A key is said\r\nto indicate a woman, a sword a man; shears sometimes represent a woman,\r\nsometimes a wool-stapler; a chalice or a book, or both, are placed on\r\nthe gravestone of a priest or other ecclesiastic. Craftsmen are often\r\nindicated by some sign of their business, as a square for a mason, a\r\nhorseshoe or a hammer for a smith. Sometimes a merchant uses his\r\ntrade-mark much as an armigerous person uses his coat of arms. Built\r\ninto the south porch of St. Mary’s Church in Gateshead there are two\r\nlarge grave-covers bearing incised crosses. One of them, a\r\nfourteenth-century slab, has at one side of the stem of the cross a key,\r\nand at the other side a fish. Most authorities think that the fish is\r\nthe mystic symbol of our Saviour, which was so dear to the early\r\nChristians, and which is frequently found on the gravestones in the\r\ncatacombs at Rome; but other antiquaries consider that the stone is to\r\nbe more literally interpreted, and that it covered the remains of a\r\nfish-wife.\r\n\r\nThe earlier grave-covers were stone lids for stone coffins, but after\r\nthe use of stone coffins was discontinued, and wooden coffins were\r\nsubstituted, the remains of the dead were often covered by these carved\r\nstone slabs. The larger part of them are uninscribed, but grave-covers\r\nwith a few lines cut on them are by no means uncommon. At Gainford there\r\nis a perfect grave-cover of the fourteenth century which bears a chalice\r\nand three floreated crosses, one large and two small. It has been\r\nsuggested that these prove this to have been the burial-place of an\r\necclesiastic and two children, for burial in a monk’s frock or in the\r\ngrave of a priest was long considered by all classes of people to be\r\ndesirable. This stone, though it is of early fourteenth-century period,\r\nbears an inscription to Laurence Brockett, Regius Professor of Modern\r\nHistory at Cambridge, who died in 1768. His executors seem to have\r\nthought that an old gravestone was just as good as a new one.\r\n\r\nOf quaint sepulchral inscriptions there are many in the county. The one\r\nin Monkwearmouth Church to the memory of a Mrs. Lee is on a small marble\r\ntablet on the vestry wall. It reads:\r\n\r\n    HEERE VNDER LYETH Yᴱ BODDYE OF MARY LEE\r\n    DAVGHTER TO PETER DELAVALE LATE OF\r\n    TINMOVTH GENT SHEE DIED IN CHYLDBED\r\n              YE 23 OF MAY 1617\r\n        HAPIE IS Yᵀ SOVLE Yᵀ HEERE\r\n        ON EARTH DID LIVE A HARMLESS LYFE\r\n        & HAPPIE MAYD Yᵀ MADE\r\n        SOE CHAST AN HONNEST WIFE.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that a lawyer \"of ability and integrity\" should not be\r\nable to make himself a sound will. In Greatham Chapel there is an\r\ninscription: \"In memory of Ralph Bradley, Esq. an eminent Councillor at\r\nLaw, born in this parish, who bequeathed a large fortune, acquired in a\r\ngreat measure by his abilities and integrity, to the purchasing of books\r\ncalculated to promote the interests of virtue and religion, and the\r\nhappiness of mankind. He died the 28th day of December 1788, in the 72d\r\nyear of his age....\" Below, on a copper plate, is: \"By a decree of\r\nEdward Lord Thurlow, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, on the 2ᵈ\r\nday of August 1791, the charitable intention mentioned above was set\r\naside in favour of the next of kin.\"\r\n\r\nIn Stockton Church we may read that on \"Wednesday the 19th of May 1773\r\nwas here interred the body of Mrs. Sarah Baker ... aged 59. Do thou\r\nreflect in time; death itself is nothing, but prepare to be you know not\r\nwhat, to go you know not where.\"\r\n\r\nAt Houghton-le-Spring stands the massy altar-tomb of the great Bernard\r\nGilpin, \"the apostle of the North,\" that sweet-natured, fearless, and\r\nhumble-minded man who so narrowly escaped a martyr’s death at the stake.\r\nThe tomb bears his coat of arms and the following:\r\n\r\nBERNERD                                             OBIT QVA\r\nGILPIN RE     [A bear with a crescent on its side,  RTV DIE M\r\nCTOR HV             leaning against a tree.]        ARTII AN.\r\nIVS ECCLIÆ                                          DOM. 1583.\r\n\r\n      See here his Dust shut up whose Generous mind\r\n      No stop before in Honours path could find.\r\n      Truth Faith and Justice, and a Loyall Heart\r\n      In him Showd Nature, which in most is Art.\r\n\r\nIn the same church of Houghton-le-Spring there is the following epitaph:\r\n\"Here Lyes interr’d the Body of Nicolas Conyers Esqʳ. High Sheriff of\r\nthis County Chiefe of yᵉ Family of Conyers of the House of Boulby in\r\nYorkshire. He dyed at South Biddick Mar: 27 A.D. 1689 his age 57.\" Below\r\nis his crest.\r\n\r\nAt Houghton Hall Robert Hutton, a zealous Puritan and a Captain in\r\nCromwell’s army, was buried in his own orchard, where his altar-tomb is\r\ninscribed: \"HIC JACET ROBERTVS HVTTON ARMIGER QVI OBIIT AVG. DIE NONO\r\n1681 ET MORIENDO VIVIT.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Galilee Chapel at the west end of Durham Cathedral there is a\r\nstone on the floor inscribed:\r\n\r\n    JOHN BRIMLEIS BODY HERE DOTH LY,\r\n    WHO PRAY SED GOD WITH HAND AND VOICE;\r\n    BY MUSICKES HEAVENLY HARMONIE\r\n    DULL MINDS HE MAID IN GOD REJOICE.\r\n    HIS SOUL INTO THE HEAVENS IS LYFT\r\n    TO PRAISE HIM STILL THAT GAVE THE GYFT.\r\n\r\nThis Brimley was master of the Song School at Durham Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThat mighty builder, Hugh Pudsey, who was Bishop of Durham from 1153 to\r\n1195, seems to have had a fellow-worker who pleased him in the person of\r\nChristian the Mason, whose grave-cover is at Pittington. One wonders\r\nwhether it was after Christian had built for the Bishop the stout\r\nfortifications of Durham Castle, or whether it was when he had finished\r\nthe beautiful Galilee Chapel of the cathedral, that Pudsey gave him, as\r\nwe know he did, forty acres in the moor at South Sherburn, besides other\r\nlands, \"quit of all rent whilst he should remain in the service of the\r\nbishop.\" Pudsey’s own tomb in Durham Cathedral is broken and dispoiled,\r\nbut Christian the Mason’s grave-cover at Pittington can still be read:\r\n\r\n    ✠NOMEN ABENS CRISTI TVMVLO TVMVLATVR IN ISTO\r\n    ✠QVI TVMVLVM CERNIT COMMENDET CVM PRECE CRISTO,\r\n\r\nwhich may be interpreted: \"One having the name of Christ is buried here.\r\nLet him who beholds the grave commend himself with prayer to Christ.\"\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard of St. Hild’s at Hartlepool, about 6 feet from the\r\neast wall of the modern chancel, there is an old altar-tomb covered with\r\na very large slab of bluish stone. If it has ever been inscribed the\r\nlettering is now utterly weathered off, but it has the lion of Bruce on\r\nthe uprights at the sides still faintly visible. This is the\r\nresting-place of the fathers of Robert Bruce. They owned Hart and\r\nHartlepool for many generations before Robert Bruce claimed the crown of\r\nScotland in 1306. His lands in the county of Durham were then seized and\r\ngiven to the Cliffords. In Easington Church there is an effigy of a lady\r\nin thirteenth-century costume, which probably represents Isabella, first\r\nwife of John Fitz-Marmaduke. She was the daughter of Robert de Brus of\r\nSkelton, and the sister of Robert Bruce, King of Scotland.\r\n\r\nComing last to the ordinary inscriptions on the tombstones and\r\nheadstones of our churchyards, one of the first things that strikes an\r\nobserver is the large number of cases where, though the stone remains,\r\nthe inscription is wholly or partly weathered off and lost; such cases\r\nare an occasion of woe to the genealogist. In looking through a country\r\nchurchyard it will often be found that 10 per cent. of the stones are\r\nunreadable. This is generally because a soft and unsuitable stone has\r\nbeen used. Some slate-stones stand well; limestones and marbles only\r\nlast while they are in a church, rain and slight traces of acid in the\r\natmosphere soon disintegrate them out of doors. Granite will probably\r\nendure very long, but it has been little used in Durham churchyards, and\r\nonly since about 1860. Sandstones are most generally used, and some of\r\nthese, of a close-grain and of a dark colour when old, stand exceedingly\r\nwell. The fell sandstones, or hassells, used in the west of the county,\r\nare almost as hard as granite. They are very difficult to cut, so the\r\nlettering on them is often quite shallow; but stones 200 years old are\r\nquite unaffected by weather. Soft sandstones, which are easily cut,\r\neither crumble and decay gradually, or in some cases they scale off in\r\nflakes and perish very quickly. It is common to see two stones of about\r\nthe same date, standing side by side, one of which is sound and clear,\r\nwhile the other cannot be read. Frequently one finds a stone where,\r\nowing to differences of hardness, one part of the inscription is sharp\r\nand legible, while other parts are completely gone.\r\n\r\nAlong the parishes on the coast of the county the wanderer cannot fail\r\nto be struck with the constant repetition of the words, \"Lost at sea,\"\r\nand if he should turn to the registers of these parishes and read the\r\nmany entries like, \"A woman at ye sea side found drowned,\" \"A man cast\r\nupon our sands by the sea,\" \"Foure Duchmen wth a woman and a childe\r\nbeing drowned by shipwrack were buried in this Churchyard,\" he will\r\nlearn what a heavy tithe the sea takes from the land, and how high is\r\nthe price that man pays for the sovereignty of the sea.\r\n\r\nPunning epitaphs are, fortunately, not numerous in the county. Here is\r\none, from Stockton, to the memory of two masons, \"Ralph Wood, who\r\ndeparted this life Oct. 22, 1730, in the 67th year of his age. Here\r\nlieth the Body of Ralph Wood, aged 67, 1743.\r\n\r\n    \"We that have made tombs for others,\r\n            Now here we lie;\r\n     Once we were two flourishing Woods,\r\n            But now we die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLES AND HALLS OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY HENRY R. LEIGHTON\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the county of Durham is not studded with castles and peels like\r\nits northern neighbour, nor decked with many ancient homes in a still\r\npicturesque and habitable condition, like the moors and valleys of York,\r\nit is still fairly rich in buildings of historic and antiquarian\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Wear alone, if followed from the source to the mouth,\r\nmay be compared to some miniature Rhine in picturesqueness. The\r\nmountainous scenery of Weardale, and the frequent woods and plantations\r\nthat ornament the banks of its lower reaches, the castles of Stanhope,\r\nWitton, Auckland, Brancepeth, Durham, Lumley, Lambton, and Hilton,\r\nrising in a stately succession, to say nothing of the glorious old\r\ncathedral, the monastic ruins of Finchale, and the grey old tower of\r\nWearmouth, make a panorama unrivalled in its way. It may, however, be\r\nremarked in all fairness that almost every English stream can tell a\r\nsimilar story, and for a vision, in homely and familiar buildings, of a\r\nglorious past our England stands unrivalled.\r\n\r\nThe first-named of the above mansions, Stanhope Castle, stands upon the\r\nsite of a fortified house existing in the time of Bishop Anthony Bek.\r\nThe present building is, however, a Georgian structure erected about a\r\ncentury ago by Cuthbert Rippon, M.P. for Gateshead. The old home of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITTON CASTLE IN 1779.]\r\n\r\nthe Fetherstonhaughs, so long associated with this district, Stanhope\r\nHall, is an Elizabethan mansion with several panelled rooms, and is now\r\ndivided amongst a number of tenants.\r\n\r\nWitton Castle, erected by the great baronial house of Eure, stands on\r\nthe south side of the river, not very far from Witton-le-Wear. It was\r\nerected somewhere about 1410, for in that year Bishop Langley granted a\r\npardon to Sir Ralph Eure for having commenced to embattle his\r\nmanor-house at Witton. It originally consisted of a square bailey,\r\nsurrounded by an outer wall, with a projecting keep on the north side.\r\n\r\nThe keep has been considerably altered at various periods. It is oblong\r\nin shape, with corner turrets rising above the roof. The basement\r\nconsists of one barrel-vaulted apartment, with adjoining chambers in the\r\nnorth-west, south-west, and south-east turrets; the entrances to two of\r\nthese were originally fastened on the outer side. The first floor is the\r\ngreat hall, and has doorways leading into chambers in the turrets.\r\nAnother door in the north-east corner leads to a newel staircase\r\nascending to the battlements. The room immediately over the east end of\r\nthe great hall has a doorway opening into a small mural chamber,\r\noriginally a latrine, in the north-east turret. This floor has a passage\r\nin the thickness of the west wall. The parapets are reached by the\r\nstaircase already referred to. The turrets at the north-east and\r\nsouth-east corners project like angle buttresses, and the latter has two\r\nfigures in armour, similar to those at Hilton Castle, standing on the\r\nparapet. The north-west turret is larger, and its sides are parallel\r\nwith the walls of the keep. The south-west turret is still larger, and\r\nit projects beyond the south front, having its west wall continued in\r\nline with that of the main building. All the turrets have crenellated\r\nparapets. The eastern turrets have their alternate sides machicolated on\r\ndouble corbels.\r\n\r\nThe outer wall has two gateways, one on the east, and the other on the\r\nwest side, leading into the courtyard. Both are defended by machicolated\r\ngalleries above, the parapet being carried outwards on double corbels.\r\nThe whole wall is defended by a broad battlement with a high parapet\r\nround the top. There are embrasures at intervals, each originally\r\ndefended by movable shutters; a round socket on one side, and a slot on\r\nthe other, remain to show where the pivots moved. A number of round\r\nholes in the walls were intended to support woodwork on which platforms\r\ncould be erected, thus enabling the garrison to strike at attackers\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nEach angle of this outer or curtain wall was originally strengthened by\r\na bartizan. Three of these were circular, but one, that at the\r\nnorth-west corner, was pulled down in the early days of last century.\r\nThe fourth bartizan, that at the south-west corner of the wall, is\r\nalmost square in shape, with the outer walls projecting and resting on\r\ncorbels. It contains a guardroom, with a fireplace, and two doors\r\nopening on to the adjoining battlements. The south-east bartizan also\r\ncontains a room, circular in shape, with a loopholed wall. About a\r\ncentury ago the castle was unfortunately damaged by fire. It was\r\nafterwards restored by Mr. J. T. H. Hopper, the owner.\r\n\r\nTracing the river eastwards, the ancient home and palace of the Bishops\r\nand Lords Palatine stands close to the river and to the east of Auckland\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nRobert de Graystanes, one of the early chroniclers, states that Bishop\r\nAnthony Bek erected the manor-house at Auckland, but from several\r\nentries in the Boldon Book it is evident that the Bishops had a\r\nresidence there at the time that record was drawn up.\r\n\r\nThe existing buildings are extensive, and are approached from the\r\nmarket-place through a castellated gateway. One of the most prominent\r\nand interesting features is the chapel, which was originally the great\r\nhall. It was adapted for its present purpose and consecrated by Bishop\r\nCosin. Prior to the great Civil War, there were two chapels, variously\r\nreferred to, and as early as 1338, as the major and the minor. One of\r\nthese was over the other, and they stood to the south of the castle\r\nproper, near to a postern which opened on to a road outside the park.\r\nWhen for a while the Episcopal Church was abolished by a Puritan\r\nGovernment, and the old story of spiteful spoliation began, Auckland\r\nPalace was sold to Sir Arthur Heslerigg for £6,102 8s. 11½d. This\r\nredoubtable worthy appears to have dismantled a considerable portion of\r\nthe buildings. He blew up the chapels,[11] and commenced to alter the\r\nplace to suit his own ideas.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that Sir Arthur left his projected buildings in an\r\nunfinished state, for when Bishop Cosin came to his diocese at the\r\nRestoration, he wrote that the castle \"had been pul’d down and ruined.\"\r\nThe Bishop commenced an extensive restoration, and a number of\r\ninteresting letters and agreements have been preserved showing the\r\nprogress made.\r\n\r\nAs it now stands, the chapel is divided into nave and aisles by arcades,\r\neach of four bays. The supporting pillars are clearly those described by\r\nLeland, who, speaking of the great hall, says: \"There be divers pillars\r\nof black marble speckled with white.\" Each pillar consists of four\r\nclustered cylindrical shafts, two being of Weardale marble, and two of\r\nfreestone. The four pillars nearest the west are banded half-way up, and\r\nthe capitals of the two western pillars are carved with foliage, the\r\nnorth-western showing also the spiral scroll or volute. The capitals of\r\nthe other pillars and the bases of all are moulded, the latter resting\r\non square plinths.\r\n\r\nThe arches are richly moulded, and have labels terminating in carved\r\nornaments. They rest at the east end on responds of three clustered\r\nshafts, two of marble, and one of freestone, with moulded capitals and\r\nbases. At the west end the arches rest on highly ornamental corbels.\r\nEach of the latter consists in its lower portion of two carved heads,\r\nthe northernmost being of Bishops wearing mitres, and the southern of\r\ncrowned Kings. From within the mitres and crowns rise dwarfed shafts\r\nwith Late Transitional foliage carved on the bells. Each capital is\r\nsurmounted with a square moulded abacus, on which rest the bases of a\r\ntriplet of dwarfed, clustered shafts corresponding to those in the piers\r\nof the arcades. In the spandrels between the arches, on both sides, are\r\ncarved corbels; those on the inner side carry single cylindrical shafts\r\nsurmounted by moulded capitals, and originally carried the pendant posts\r\nof the roof. The outer corbels supported the rafters of the aisle roofs.\r\nThere is now but little doubt that this portion of the building was\r\nerected by Bishop Pudsey.\r\n\r\nBishop Hatfield made further improvements, inserting the windows still\r\nexisting. At a much later period, as already mentioned, Bishop Cosin\r\naltered and restored the castle, which he appears to have made his\r\nfavourite residence. He certainly took great delight and pride in\r\nimproving his country home. Most of the fine woodwork in the chapel is\r\nhis work--the roof, mouldings, and the great screen at the west end\r\nbeing particularly noteworthy.\r\n\r\nSince his time the chapel has been but little altered. Bishop Van\r\nMildert refloored it, and Bishop Lightfoot erected a new reredos, and\r\nfilled most of the windows with stained glass.\r\n\r\nThe other portions of the castle have been considerably modernized, and\r\nbear but little resemblance to Pennant’s picture of it. The room which\r\nhe describes as \"below stairs,\" and having painted on the old wainscot\r\n\"the arms of a strange assemblage of potentates, from Queen Elizabeth,\r\nwith all the European princes, to the Emperors of Abissinia,\r\nBildelgerid, Carthage, and Tartaria, sixteen peers of the same reign,\r\nknights of the garter, and above\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUMLEY CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nthem the arms of every bishoprick in England,\" is now used as the\r\nhousekeeper’s storeroom.\r\n\r\nThe wing containing the servants’ hall (on the ceiling of which is a\r\nplaster shield of Bishop Tunstall’s arms) and the dining-room was\r\ncommenced by Bishop Ruthall, and completed by the former prelate. The\r\narms of both Bishops appear on the exterior of the building. Adjoining\r\nthis wing to the west is another of some length, still known by the\r\ncurious name of _Scotland_, and undoubtedly erected by Tunstall. No very\r\nsatisfactory reason has been offered for the derivation of its name.\r\n\r\nBrancepeth Castle stands within a mile from the River Wear, a little to\r\nthe south of the village of the same name. There was undoubtedly a\r\ncastle there in the twelfth century, towards the end of which it passed,\r\nby the marriage of Emma, widow of Peter de Valoignes, and only child of\r\nBertram de Bulmer, to Geoffrey de Neville, from the former to the latter\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe present castle is stated by Leland to have been erected by Ralph,\r\nfirst Earl of Westmorland. It was defended north and east by a moat;\r\nsouth and west the walls rise from a rock nearly forty feet in height.\r\nThe original gateway, defended by a portcullis and flanked by square\r\ntowers, stood on the site of the present gate, and was approached from\r\nthe north. It has been destroyed. It opened directly into the courtyard,\r\nsouth-west of which are the residential parts of the castle.\r\n\r\nThere were, when Hutchinson wrote, four towers, closely conjoined. Three\r\nof these remain, containing respectively the dining-room, saloon, and\r\nthe baron’s hall. The destroyed tower stood north of the last mentioned,\r\nbut was not so high. It contained three stories, and was probably, as\r\nMr. Boyle has suggested, the great hall.\r\n\r\nThe projecting angles of the towers are surmounted by small turrets,\r\neight in number, the arrangement consisting of two sides rising directly\r\nfrom the sides of the buttresses on which they are built, whilst the\r\nother two are machicolated, the parapets resting on corbels.\r\n\r\nTwo other towers now standing at either end of the billiard-room are\r\nrespectively used as the chapel and the library. The castle possesses a\r\nnumber of other interesting features.\r\n\r\nAmongst the pictures is one by Hogarth, painted for the first Viscount\r\nBoyne, and representing several members of the _Hell-fire Club_. They\r\nare supposed to have assembled in a wine-cellar, and resolved not to\r\npart until its contents have been consumed. Sir Philip Hoby is depicted\r\nsitting on a cask of claret. Immediately behind him, with his hand held\r\nup, is Mr. De Grey, and below him is Lord John Cavendish, who has drawn\r\na spigot from the cask to let the wine flow into a bowl. Lord Sandwich\r\nis kneeling down, holding a bottle to his mouth. Lord Galway lies\r\nextended on a form, in such a position that the liquor from a cask above\r\nhim is flowing into his mouth. The arrangement of the four central\r\nfigures is a clever imitation of a statue of _Charity_ shown in the\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\nThere is some fine armour in the present and modern great hall, amongst\r\nothers a suit richly inlaid in gold, and traditionally said to have been\r\ntaken from the Scottish King after the Battle of Neville’s Cross,\r\nalthough really it is of Elizabethan date.\r\n\r\nThe existing castle in Durham City, long the principal seat of the\r\nEpiscopal Princes, largely helps, with its frowning walls and grim\r\nbattlements, standing side by side with the cathedral, to make Durham\r\none of the most picturesque cities in this country.\r\n\r\nThe castle is approached from the north-west corner of the Palace Green,\r\na short avenue leading to the gateway, which was modernized by Bishop\r\nBarrington. The iron-bound gates were placed there by Bishop Tunstall,\r\nand one of them contains a wicket which is the subject of one of\r\nSpearman’s amusing anecdotes. He states that Bishop Crewe had been\r\npressing Dr. Grey, Rector of Bishopwearmouth, and Dr. Morton, Rector of\r\nBoldon, to read King James’s declaration for a dispensing power in their\r\nparish churches. Both declined and began to argue against it, when the\r\nBishop appears to have lost his temper. He told Dr. Grey that his age\r\nmade him dote, and that he had forgotten his learning. \"The good old\r\nDoctor briskly replied he had forgott more learning than his Lordship\r\never had. ‘Well,’ said the Bishop, ‘I’ll forgive and reverence you, but\r\ncannot pardon that blockhead Morton, whom I raised from nothing.’ They\r\nthereupon took their leave of the Bishop, who with great civility waited\r\nupon them towards the gate, and ye porter opening ye wikett or posterne\r\nonly, ye Bishop said, ‘Sirrah, why don’t you open ye great gates?’ ‘No,’\r\nsays ye Reverend Dr. Grey, ‘my Lord, wee’le leave _ye broad way_ to your\r\nlordship, _ye strait way_ will serve us.’\"\r\n\r\nThe gateway leads directly into the courtyard. A door and flight of\r\nsteps in the wall to the left leads into the Fellows’ Garden, formerly\r\nthe private garden of the Bishops, through which they could enter Bishop\r\nCosin’s library.\r\n\r\nCrossing the court to the left, the first building approached is partly\r\nof early Norman date, with additions by Bishop Fox, and a later\r\nrestoration by Bishop Cosin, whose arms, impaling the see, are upon the\r\nfront. It is now used entirely as students’ quarters.\r\n\r\nA portico farther along the court leads into the great hall, erected by\r\nBishop Anthony Bek. The hall measures 101 feet long by 35 feet wide, and\r\nwas restored somewhere about 1850.\r\n\r\nThe window at the north end was filled with stained glass in 1882 to\r\ncommemorate the jubilee of the University.\r\n\r\nThe walls are hung with paintings, and include:\r\n\r\n1. A collection of thirteen portraits of English Archbishops and\r\nBishops, said to have been made by Bishop Cosin.\r\n\r\n2. Ten pictures of the Apostles, which were taken at St. Mary’s, in\r\nSpain, in the expedition under the Duke of Ormond, and purchased by the\r\nDean and Chapter in 1753.\r\n\r\n3. A number of portraits of prebendaries and professors.\r\n\r\n4. Portraits of Charles I., Bishop Cosin, and Charles II.\r\n\r\nOn the same wall as the last-mentioned portraits the banners of the\r\nDurham local volunteer companies, raised to defend the country at the\r\ntime of Napoleon’s threatened invasion, are suspended.\r\n\r\nA door at the north end of the hall leads to Bishop Cosin’s great\r\nstaircase, which is most handsomely carved.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the staircase a corridor, the woodwork of which\r\noriginally formed part of the same Bishop’s choir screen in the\r\ncathedral, may be entered.\r\n\r\nThe staircase itself, however, leads more directly to Bishop Tunstall’s\r\nGallery, and to several apartments, from one of which a door opens upon\r\nthe terrace on the north side of the castle.\r\n\r\nTunstall’s Gallery contains several objects of interest, and the walls\r\nare covered with sixteenth-century tapestry.\r\n\r\nHere also is the magnificent Norman doorway erected by Bishop Pudsey as\r\nthe entrance to his lower hall. From its position and the weathering of\r\nthe stonework, it is supposed to have originally been approached by a\r\nstairway from the court; the case at the top must have been roofed with\r\nopen arcades at the sides.\r\n\r\nThe present Senate-room of the University contains some good tapestry,\r\nillustrating the life of Moses, and dating from the sixteenth century.\r\nThis room also contains a handsome carved fireplace, armorially\r\ndecorated, and evidently the work of Bishop James. In the centre are the\r\nRoyal Arms, Garter, and Motto. On either side are the arms of the\r\nPalatinate impaling the Bishop’s dolphin and cross-crosslets, with the\r\nJames’s motto, \"Dei Gratia Sum quod Sum.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILTON CASTLE WEST FRONT.]\r\n\r\nThe adjoining anteroom contains several paintings, including portraits\r\nof King James II. and his Queen, Mary of Modena.\r\n\r\nLeaving the county town behind, the picturesque outlines of Lumley\r\nCastle may be seen for some miles from the train journeying to\r\nNewcastle. It is situated about a mile from Chester-le-Street, but on\r\nthe opposite bank of the Wear. The place is first mentioned by Styr, the\r\nson of Ulf, in a list of gifts made to St. Cuthbert.\r\n\r\nThe castle is supposed to have been erected by Sir Ralph Lumley, who\r\nobtained licences from Richard II. and Bishop Skirlaw to embattle his\r\nhouse of Lumley. It is in arrangement a square courtyard, surrounded by\r\na quadrangle. Two of the fronts, the south and north, measure 65 yards 1\r\nfoot in length, the other two 58 yards and 1 foot. Oblong towers, of\r\ngreater height than the main portions of each front, from which they\r\nproject, strengthen and guard each corner. The most exterior angle of\r\neach tower is capped by a buttress.\r\n\r\nThe west front is the oldest existing portion of the castle, and is\r\nsupposed to have been the Lumley manor-house, before Sir Ralph extended\r\nand added to it.\r\n\r\nOriginally the east side of it, that looking into the courtyard, was the\r\nprincipal front, and in its centre the gateway, flanked by\r\nsemi-octagonal turrets, may still be seen. The front of the gateway is\r\nformed of two arches, the outer segmental headed, and the inner one\r\npointed. Between these is the groove wherein the portcullis ran. The\r\narch leads to a vaulted passage which entered the original courtyard. On\r\nthe north side of the passage is a pointed doorway, leading into a\r\nnarrow corridor, having a latrine at its east end, and connected\r\noriginally with the gatekeeper’s room.\r\n\r\nThe present gateway is in the centre of the east front, and has\r\nincorporated with it an earlier round-headed archway, with\r\nsemi-octagonal jambs and moulded imposts. On either side of it is a\r\nsquare turret, surmounted by octagonal machicolated parapets, the\r\nalternate sides of which are embrasured.\r\n\r\nThe turrets are joined by a machicolated gallery, defended by a\r\nbattlemented parapet. Above the door are six sculptured coats of arms.\r\nBetween the two highest, Neville and Percy, is the royal coat of Richard\r\nII. Below is the Lumley coat, having on the sinister side the arms of\r\nGrey, and on the dexter the coat of Hilton. The shields are all\r\nsurmounted by the respective family crests.\r\n\r\nA room on the south side of the gateway contains in its centre a flag,\r\nwhich on being raised leaves open the entrance to a vaulted chamber\r\nabout 10 feet square and some 16 feet deep. From the existence of a\r\nlatrine, and a little ventilation from a small unglazed loophole looking\r\ninto the courtyard, it seems to have been intended as a safe place for\r\nthe custody of prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the north-east tower are two rooms, divided by a modern partition,\r\nand showing evidence that they originally formed the private chapel of\r\nthe family. The south-east tower contains on its second floor the state\r\nbedroom, in which King James I. is said to have slept when he visited\r\nLumley.\r\n\r\nIn the north-west tower is the famous kitchen, which Howitt described as\r\n\"one of the most stupendous, lofty, and every way remarkable kitchens in\r\nthe kingdom.\" The south-west tower contains the banqueting-hall,\r\ncelebrated for its very fine stuccoed ceiling, part of the work\r\ninitiated by Richard, second Earl of Scarborough.\r\n\r\nBetween the towers on the west side the main building forms the baron’s,\r\nor great, hall, which probably remained unaltered from the time of Sir\r\nRalph to the early days of the century before last. The fireplace is the\r\nwork of John, Lord Lumley, and is decorated with the family arms,\r\nimpaling FitzAlan. Here also is a large equestrian statue, representing\r\nLiulph, a traditional ancestor of the house. There are also a series of\r\ninteresting family portraits.\r\n\r\nNot far from Lumley, Lambton Castle stands on the northern and opposite\r\nbank of the river. The original home of the Lambton family was, however,\r\non the same bank as Lumley. According to an old view, it was a double\r\nhouse of stone, with flanking, gabled wings, and the grounds laid out in\r\nparterres and terraces. It remained the residence of the family, until\r\nit was dismantled in 1797 by William Henry Lambton, who had adopted\r\nHarraton Hall as the family seat.[12]\r\n\r\nThe present Lambton Castle[13] stands on the site and incorporates\r\nportions of the original building of Harraton Hall, a manor-house\r\nerected about the year 1600. Very considerable additions were made to\r\nthis hall by William Henry Lambton, grandfather of the late Lord Durham,\r\nfrom designs by the elder Bonomi, in the Italian style. The first Lord\r\nDurham also made considerable alterations and additions to the building\r\nfrom plans furnished by Bonomi, the general appearance of the mansion\r\nbeing entirely changed. The south front is in the Tudor style and\r\ncastellated, and the north is Norman.\r\n\r\nThe great hall is panelled, and the windows are glazed with richly\r\nstained glass, containing a representation of \"Ye Legend of the Worme of\r\nLambton,\" and also the heraldic emblems of the family. The dimensions of\r\nthe hall are 94 feet by 36 feet, being larger than St. Stephen’s Hall,\r\nWestminster. The principal staircase leading out of the hall,\r\ncommunicating with the upper apartments, is 24 feet wide and 36 feet\r\nhigh. East of the hall is the dining-room and west is the drawing-room,\r\nabutting on the terraces of the west lawn.\r\n\r\nOwing to the subsidence of the hill on which the castle stands, through\r\nsome old colliery workings underneath falling in, the castle had become,\r\nwhen the second Earl succeeded to the estates, insecure. To meet this,\r\nand strengthen the foundations, the workings, two seams deep, round the\r\ncastle, to the extent of 4½ acres, were filled up with débris. Three\r\nseams lower still were bricked up, over 10,000,000 bricks being used,\r\nand in several instances in the fourth seam the brickwork exceeded 30\r\nfeet in height.\r\n\r\nHilton Castle, like Lambton, stands on the north bank of the River Wear,\r\non a gentle slope commanding an extensive view of the valley to the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe present building, a melancholy-looking tower, is only the gatehouse\r\nof the original castle. It is first mentioned in the inquisition\r\npost-mortem of William de Hilton in 1435, when it is described as \"a\r\nhouse constructed of stone, called the Yethouse.\" The intention of the\r\noriginal builder, the William just mentioned, was evidently to erect an\r\nextensive mansion on a similar scale, but there is sufficient evidence\r\nto show that he never completed the work.\r\n\r\nThat there were other buildings probably surrounding a courtyard is\r\nproved by various inventories. In 1559, after the death of Sir Thomas\r\nHilton, an inventory of his effects mentions the great chamber, the\r\ngreen chamber, the middle and new chambers, the gallery, the wardrobe,\r\nthe parlour, the chamber over the hall door, and various out-buildings,\r\nsuch as the brewhouse, buttery, and the barns. The tower is mentioned\r\nseparately, and the term evidently applies to the existing building.\r\n\r\nThese surrounding buildings were probably removed by John Hilton, who\r\nearly in the eighteenth century built\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD TOWER AT RAVENSWORTH CASTLE.]\r\n\r\na large wing in the Italian style against the north end of the\r\ngatehouse. This erection was three stories in height, having pedimented\r\nwindows in the two lower floors, and square-headed windows in the story\r\nabove. John Hilton also, to some extent, spoiled the ancient gatehouse\r\nby inserting a number of similar pedimented windows in it. His son, the\r\nlast of the male line to own Hilton, and also named John, added a\r\nsimilar south wing. Both these wings were castellated--at any rate, on\r\nthe east front.\r\n\r\nThe castle passed by descent to the Musgraves, and afterwards by\r\nsuccessive sales to the Bowes and Briggs families, and again within the\r\nlast year or two to the Monkwearmouth Colliery Company.\r\n\r\nAs it now stands, the tower presents a bold and picturesque outline. It\r\nis divided, on the west front, into three bays by projecting,\r\nsquare-shaped turrets. The main entrance is through the central bay,\r\nover which is a fine array of heraldry. Immediately beneath the arcade,\r\nthe elaborately carved and projecting canopies of which fell in 1882, is\r\na banner and staff of the Royal Arms of France and England _temp._ Henry\r\nV. Beneath the banner are the arms of Neville, Vesci, and Percy, and\r\namongst other coats represented are those of the families of Lumley,\r\nGrey, Eure, Washington, Felton, Heron, Surtees, and Bowes. On the\r\nright-hand turret, close to the entrance, beneath a canopy, is a large\r\nbanner of the Hilton arms. The east front shows a curious sculpture of\r\nthe family badge, _a roebuck collared and chained_. Below is the family\r\ncoat, accompanied with their curious crest--_the head of Moses, horned\r\nwith triple rays_.\r\n\r\nThe battlements are exceedingly picturesque and decorated with numerous\r\nstatued figures, one of which apparently represents the slayer of the\r\nLambton Worm.\r\n\r\nThe ancient family chapel stands in a semi-ruinous condition a little to\r\nthe north of the castle.\r\n\r\nRavensworth Castle was erected towards the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and has belonged successively to the Fitz-Marmadukes, Lumleys,\r\nBoyntons, Gascoignes, and Liddells. It originally consisted of four\r\ntowers, one standing at each angle of a courtyard and joined by curtain\r\nwalls. Two of these towers still stand and form part of the present\r\ncastle, which was erected shortly after 1808, from designs by Nash. It\r\nmay be added that the castle was formerly known as Ravenshelm,\r\nRavensworth being the name of the adjoining village. Not far from the\r\ncastle, and near to the road leading to the north entrance, is an old\r\ncross commonly known as the \"Butter Cross.\" It is stated that the\r\ncountry people left their produce here for the citizens of Newcastle to\r\ntake when that city was infested by the plague in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROSS AT RAVENSWORTH.]\r\n\r\nA few miles to the west, Gibside, a seat of the Earl of Strathmore,\r\nstands in an exceedingly picturesque position. A terrace at the back of\r\nthe house stands above a sheer descent to an exceedingly wild glen. The\r\nolder portions of the building were erected by Sir William Blakiston,\r\nwho had inherited the estate from his grandmother, an heiress of the\r\nMarley family, in the reign of James I. Over the entrance are the Royal\r\nArms, and the arms of Blakiston and Marley quarterly with the initials\r\nW. I. B. for Sir William and his wife Jane Lambton. There is also an\r\ninteresting sundial inscribed with the motto _Ut hora, sic vita_. The\r\nold drawing-room has a large fireplace, with figures of Samson and\r\nHercules at either side, and above a further heraldic display of the\r\nfamily alliances.\r\n\r\nThere are four baronial mansions lying between the Wear and the Tees.\r\n\r\nBarnard Castle, once a residence of the princely house of Baliol, has\r\nfor long years been a ruin.\r\n\r\nOriginally erected by Bernard de Baliol, son of Guy de Baliol, Lord of\r\nBailleul en Vimeu in Picardy, and founder also of Baynard’s Castle in\r\nLondon, it passed on the attainder of his descendant John Baliol,\r\nsometime King of Scotland, in 1296 to Bishop Bek. A few years later\r\nEdward I. severed the Durham fees of Bruce and Baliol from the control\r\nof the Palatinate and granted Barnard Castle to the Beauchamps. By\r\nmarriage the estate passed to the Nevilles, and by marriage again to the\r\nCrown. Later it passed to the Vanes, who hold it still. The castle,\r\nwhich was of some size and great strength, stands in a commanding\r\nposition above the River Tees. A great portion of the remaining\r\nbuildings dates from Norman times. One of the towers is still known as\r\nthe Brackenbury Tower, evidently deriving its name from the family of\r\nthe famous Constable of the Tower of London. The castle is also\r\nassociated with Richard III., whose badge of \"the hog\" occurs in one of\r\nthe rooms.\r\n\r\nNot far from Barnard, Streatlam Castle stands in a valley between that\r\ntown and Raby. It has remained the property of the descendants of the\r\nowners in the twelfth century to this day, although it has passed by\r\nmarriage successively to the Traynes, Boweses, and Lyons. The existing\r\ncastle includes some portions of the structure erected by old Sir\r\nWilliam Bowes. This Sir William is stated on the death of his young wife\r\nJane, daughter of Lord Greystock, under the age of twenty, to have gone\r\nto the wars in France, where for some years he was Chamberlain to the\r\nRegent, the Duke of Bedford. Sometime about 1450 he pulled down the\r\nolder castle at Streatlam, and erected a new one from designs he had\r\nbrought from France. His arms are on the north front of the castle,\r\nwhich has been altered frequently since his time. A good portion of it\r\nwas pulled down by William Blakiston Bowes, who died in 1721, leaving\r\nhis alterations incomplete.\r\n\r\nRaby Castle, one of the finest baronial piles in the North of England,\r\nand for many centuries the great seat of the princely house of Neville,\r\nwould require, to deal with it in justice, more pages than a volume of\r\nlimited space can afford. A few of its leading features must, however,\r\nbe mentioned. Portions of the present building were erected by Ralph,\r\nLord Neville, one of the commanders at Neville’s Cross, who died in\r\n1367. His son John carried on the work, and in 1378 obtained a licence\r\nfrom Bishop Hatfield to embattle and crenellate his manor-house at Raby.\r\nIn aspect the castle consists of buildings forming a rough square, with\r\ntowers projecting from three of the corners, the whole enclosing a\r\ncourtyard. The four outer sides face the cardinal points. Some distance\r\nfrom the main building, a wall 30 feet high with a deep moat on its\r\nouter side entirely enclosed it. The main entrance is guarded by a large\r\ntower thrown forward in a flanking position, rendering the approach\r\nexceedingly difficult to an opposing force. This building is known as\r\nClifford’s Tower. At the south end of a curtain wall running southwards\r\nstands the Watch Tower, which has, however, been considerably\r\nmodernized. Adjoining the great gatehouse,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREATLAM CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nwhich is the work of at least two builders, is the tower which Leland\r\nsays bears the name of Joan, wife of the first Earl of Westmorland. East\r\nof Joan’s Tower is another stretch of curtain wall now containing the\r\ndrawing-rooms, and terminating at Bulmer’s Tower, an interesting\r\nbuilding in shape an irregular pentagon. On the upper story of this\r\ntower is the badge of the builder, a large Old English <f>b</f>, doubtless like\r\nthe bull, their other badge, derived from the Bulmers.\r\n\r\nA block of modern buildings adjoining the Bulmer Tower adjoins a tower,\r\nfrom which a corridor enters the great hall, 90 feet long and 35 feet\r\nwide. Close to the hall is the kitchen, which has been preserved in all\r\nits original quaintness. Over a passage leading from the east side of\r\nthe great hall is the chapel. A short curtain wall connects this portion\r\nof the building with the Mount Raskelf Tower, evidently named after a\r\nmanor owned by the Nevilles in Yorkshire. It is rather curious to\r\nobserve that the Christian names Ralph and Henry, which occur so\r\nfrequently in old northern families, are the predominating names\r\nrespectively of the great houses of Neville and Percy.\r\n\r\nWalworth Castle, a large, picturesque old house, was erected by the\r\nJenisons in or about the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The north front,\r\nflanked by two projecting wings, has a centre three stories high\r\nterminating in a balustraded parapet. The south front has a circular\r\ntower at each end. The windows were originally decorated with fine old\r\npainted glass of heraldic design, which has been almost entirely\r\ndestroyed in modern times. Some fragments have, however, been gathered\r\ntogether and are preserved in a window in the corridor. Here King James\r\nI. was entertained and slept on his progress to the South in 1603.\r\n\r\nInferior to the larger houses, there were in the county several\r\nbuildings of great strength coming under the same head as the\r\n_peel-houses_ or _towers_ on the borders.\r\n\r\nOne of these, now only represented by a few portions of the outer walls,\r\nwas Dalden Tower. The buildings appear to have formed a tower rather\r\nlonger than square, standing on a slight mound. The walls were of\r\nrubble, 5 feet thick. In the east wall there is a square-headed niche,\r\nsurmounted by a pediment within an ogee-headed arch, the space within\r\nwhich is filled with tracery. Two blank shields are upon a cornice over\r\nthe pediment. The niche seems to point to the room once adjoining having\r\nbeen the private chapel. On the inner side of the curtain facing the\r\nwest wall there appears to have been a cell with a loophole.\r\n\r\nA more recent manor-house was built about the reign of James I.,\r\nadjoining the tower on the east, and portions of it are built into the\r\npresent farmhouse. For some generations it was a seat of the Royalist\r\nfamily of Collingwood, and, at an earlier date, of a branch of the great\r\nhouse of Bowes. It was a lady of this family, Maud, wife of Sir William\r\nBowes and heiress of Sir Robert Dalden, who possessed within the old\r\nwalls a curious library. In her will, made in 1420, she left to Matilda\r\nHilton _one Romaunce-boke_, to Dame Eleanor Washington _the boke with\r\nthe knotts_, to Elizabeth de Whitchester a book that is called\r\n_Trystram_, and to her god-daughter Maud, daughter of the Baron of\r\nHilton, _one Romaunce boke is called the Gospells_. Surtees pertinently\r\nwrites: \"Did a romance ever actually exist under this strange title? or\r\nhad the lady of Dalden met with one of Wicliffe’s Bibles, and conceived\r\nthe Gospels to be a series of fabulous adventures, in which our Saviour\r\nand His Apostles were introduced to act and to moralize like the goodly\r\npersonages who figure in the ancient mysteries, or in _Les Jeux du Roi\r\nRené d’Anjou_\"?\r\n\r\nFarther to the south an old tower, oblong in shape stood at Little Eden.\r\nIt was, however, taken down in the early days of last century by Mr.\r\nRowland Burdon, who erected the present castellated house at Castle\r\nEden. At Dinsdale, on the banks of the Tees, the remains of the ancient\r\nhome of the Surtees family were excavated by the late Mr. Scott Surtees,\r\nand showed that a large gatehouse of late twelfth-century work, with\r\nvaulted chambers and a newel stair, had once stood there.\r\n\r\nThe later manor-house of the Place family retains some portions of the\r\nolder building. With thick walls and low rooms with heavy beams and\r\nrafters, and an old oak staircase with a wicket, it still remains a\r\npicturesque fragment of former days. A stone originally fixed over a\r\ngateway destroyed shortly before Hutchinson compiled his history is now\r\nlet into the wall on the left of the farmhouse door, and bears the arms\r\nof Place quarterly with Surtees.\r\n\r\nThe home of the Surtees’s neighbours, the allied and equally noble house\r\nof Conyers, was at Sockburn, situated on the same sweep of the Tees.\r\nTraces of the foundations of gardens and orchards alone point out the\r\nsite of the old house, where Dugdale in 1666 had noted the family\r\nemblazonments in or on the building--the arms of Conyers, Vesci, Scrope,\r\nNeville, Dacre, FitzHugh, Lumley, and of the Royal Family. Surtees\r\nsuggests that seven of the coats seem to have formed a rich armorial\r\nwindow, and that amidst them ran the motto, \"REGI SECVLOR I’ MORTALI I’\r\nVISIBILI SOLI DEO HONOR ET GLORIA I’ SECVLA SECVLOR.\" When the historian\r\nwrote, \"one old decaying Spanish chestnut\" seemed alone to connect the\r\ndeserted spot with some recollection of its ancient owners. Of the old\r\nhouse not one stone remains. A new house was erected about a century ago\r\nby the baronet family of Blackett, who for some generations have owned\r\nthe manor. Here the far-famed Conyers falchion is preserved. The sword\r\ndates from the thirteenth century, and has a blade 2 feet and 5½ inches\r\nlong. The handle is partly covered with ash, and has on the pommel two\r\nshields, the three lions of England, and an eagle displayed. The cross\r\nis engraved with decorative foliage of the period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting specimens of the older fortified residences\r\nwas Ludworth Tower.[14] The building, which consisted of a\r\nthree-storeyed oblong tower of common limestone, stands near a brook, on\r\na low hill, at the head of the valley in which Shadforth village lies. A\r\nlower vaulted room up till recently still contained a large open\r\nfireplace and hearthstone. The only entrance was by a small arched door\r\nleading to a spiral stone staircase, projecting from the north-west\r\nangle of the tower. Remnants of a curtain wall exist to the east, and on\r\nthe west the adjoining ground has apparently been levelled by hand.\r\n\r\nThe whole appearance of the building, which has, unfortunately, in\r\nrecent years[15] been allowed to fall into a ruinous condition, was dark\r\nand gloomy in the extreme. The date of its erection is fixed by the\r\nlicence obtained in 1422 by Sir Thomas Holden to embattle his\r\nmanor-house of Ludworth.\r\n\r\nAt Bellasis, or Belasyse, another old house, with stone walls of great\r\nthickness and moated, is now occupied by a farmer.\r\n\r\nHollinside, an old mansion, associated with the Hardings, of whom Ralph\r\nHarding the chronicler was a noteworthy member, still stands in ruins on\r\na bank above the River Derwent. Originally three stories in height, and\r\nwith two wings forming the three sides of a narrow court. The fourth and\r\neast side is arched over and surmounted by a tower. On the west side a\r\nturret projects in line with the south wall. The interior presents\r\nseveral interesting features, and an outbuilding contains a large\r\nfireplace.\r\n\r\nPassing from the great homes of the county, and the older fortified\r\ntowers, we come to the time when, with the greater security accorded to\r\nthe minor gentry,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RABY CASTLE IN 1783.]\r\n\r\nnumerous manor-houses and country granges began to rise.\r\n\r\nEven at this time, spoiled as the county is for residential purposes, it\r\nrequires no strong effort of the imagination to picture the county as it\r\nwas in later Tudor times. The Bishops, greater than ever through the\r\ncollapse of the Nevilles, still appointed their foresters, and doubtless\r\noften made the dales resound with all the view-halloo of a gay hunt.\r\nDurham City became a stronghold of great ecclesiastical families, the\r\nsons and daughters of the prebendaries intermarrying with one another,\r\nand the descendants of successive Bishops allied themselves by cross\r\nmarriages. In the country better farmsteads became erected, and\r\nthroughout the shire the landowners began to erect more commodious\r\nresidences. It is, with one or two exceptions, from this period that the\r\nolder halls and manor-houses still in existence date. It must not be\r\nforgotten that there were at this time no great landowners in the county\r\nin the sense that we now understand the term, and almost every village\r\nhad its own predominating squire.\r\n\r\nA few houses still remain, not so strongly built as the peel-towers, yet\r\nwell adapted to defence. Holmside Hall is one of these. Once one of the\r\nprincipal seats of the great House of Tempest, it was forfeited by\r\nRobert of that name, who, with his son Michael, had joined the Earls in\r\ntheir rebellion, and therefore appears in Hall and Humberston’s Survey\r\nas a \"capital messuage, with all the housings built of stone and covered\r\nwith slate, with the orchards and gardens, within a park containing\r\nthree acres.\" Now sufficient remains to show that once the buildings\r\nwere ranged round a court and surrounded by a moat. The north side was\r\nfaced by the chapel containing a still perfect west window of two\r\ntrefoil-headed lights under a square label, with the cinquefoil of the\r\nUmphrevilles and two blank shields in the spandrels. Above the window \"a\r\nmutilated figure is fixed to the wall, with a full-moony face, and a\r\nkind of round helmet,\" of which Surtees writes: \"I should almost\r\nconjecture this to be a rude piece of Roman sculpture, removed from the\r\nstation, which may possibly have furnished the coins and squared stones\r\nused in building this chantry.\"\r\n\r\nThe house itself is a curiously confused building of many different\r\nperiods of architecture. The original gables were pulled down and the\r\nhouse enlarged to the south. The windows are mullioned and narrow and\r\nguarded with iron bars.\r\n\r\nAfter the Tempests’ fall the estate became the property of William\r\nWhittingham, the bigoted Calvinist Dean, whose name deserves perpetual\r\nexecration as the destroyer of much that was old and beautiful in Durham\r\nAbbey. It is possible that in the austere gloom that even now pervades\r\nthe old house at Holmeside, he might find something sympathetic with his\r\nown strange faith.\r\n\r\nThe Isle, another Tempest residence, stands on low ground, surrounded by\r\nmarshes caused through risings of the Skerne. It is a picturesque place,\r\nwith projecting gables and narrow mullioned lights. It was the residence\r\nof Colonel John Tempest, first M.P. for Durham County, and still belongs\r\nto the Marquess of Londonderry as representative of his family.\r\n\r\nSledwish Hall, standing lonely and sequestered, is a place of \"ghastly\r\ngrey renown.\" Upwards of a hundred years ago the bones of an infant were\r\nfound interred in a stone coffin in the field adjoining. The house, too,\r\nlike most of these old mansions, is supposed to contain secret passages\r\nand rooms. Portions of the present building, more particularly the south\r\nfront, date back to Plantagenet times, but the house as it now stands is\r\nan interesting specimen of Tudor architecture. It was rebuilt by John\r\nClopton, Queen Elizabeth’s Receiver, his great work being the ceiling in\r\nthe Orchard Chamber. This is divided into compartments by deep\r\nmouldings, ornamented by numerous crowned roses, fleurs-de-lis, and\r\npomegranates. In the centre is a shield bearing his family arms, a\r\nquarterly shield, first and fourth, _paly a lion rampant_, and second\r\nand third _a cross pattee fitchée_, over all a crescent for difference.\r\nThe arms are reversed through the artist having formed his mould without\r\nconsidering that the impression was the final result. Two other shields\r\nimpressed from the same mould bear the initials E. C. (evidently for the\r\nbuilder’s wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Ralph Ashton of Great Lever, in\r\nLancashire), the date 1584, and \"a _tun_ with a rose _clapt on_.\"[16]\r\nAbove this shield is a rose surrounded by three crowns. At the four\r\ncorners of the room are large decorative groups; two are falcons with\r\npomegranates, the third is a swan, and the fourth a boar under an\r\noak-tree devouring an acorn. A deep cornice running round the whole\r\nceiling is decorated with repeated devices of the Royal lion and the\r\nWelsh dragon supporting the crowned rose, the whole evidently symbolic\r\nof Good Queen Bess. There are several other good rooms, and a large\r\nchimney at the south-west is supported outside by three double brackets.\r\n\r\nThere are several other interesting mansions in this district. At\r\nCleatlam the old mansion of the Ewbankes still stands, gable-ended, with\r\nmullioned windows. It was sold by them in the troublous times of the\r\ngreat Civil War to the Somersets of Pauntley in Gloucester, and later\r\nwas a seat of the Wards. Another old home of the Ewbanke family was\r\nStaindrop Hall, at the east end of the village of that name. The family\r\narms, _three chevronels interlaced and on a chief three pellets_, are on\r\none of the ceilings. Still another old house, once belonging to the same\r\nrace, was Snotterton Hall, which stood about a mile to the west of\r\nStaindrop. Here the walls were embattled with crocketed pinnacles at the\r\ncorners, and the windows were triple mullioned lights under square\r\nlabels. Over the entrance the arms and crest of the Bainbridges, who\r\nsold the estate to the Ewbankes in 1607, were sculptured. A portion of\r\nthe house which was pulled down in 1831 is preserved in the present Raby\r\nGrange.\r\n\r\nWestholme Hall is another existing good specimen of Jacobean\r\narchitecture. It consists of a main building, with two gabled wings and\r\nmullioned windows. The date 1606, and the name IOHN DOWTHET on a\r\nchimney-piece in the hall, points to its erection by the Douthwaites,\r\nwho purchased the estate from the Boweses in 1603. Erected about the\r\nsame period, Gainford Hall still stands at the west end of the village.\r\nIt, too, has gable ends and mullioned windows, and several of the rooms\r\nare wainscotted. One of the latter has a stuccoed border of flowers and\r\nfruit. Over the door is the three-garbed chevron of the Cradocks and the\r\ninscription IOHN : CRADOCK 1600.\r\n\r\nAt Bishop Middleham a large old gable-ended house has a doorway with\r\njambs and a pediment of carved freestone. It stands on the west side of\r\nthe road leading to the church, and was originally the property of the\r\nWards, one of whom was Master of Sidney-Sussex College at Cambridge. In\r\n1738 it was the residence of Thomas Brunskill, whose daughter or\r\ngranddaughter married Edward Watson, of Ingleby Greenhow, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nAnother picturesque fragment of the past is the old house now standing\r\nat the western end of Thorpe Thewles village. It is built of brick, with\r\nlow rooms, and is locally stated to have been visited by Queen Anne. The\r\ntradition may possibly be a survival of one of our sovereigns’ passage\r\nthrough the county, but it is impossible that any crowned head can ever\r\nhave rested in this old mansion. A few fields away a wing of the once\r\ngreat house at Blakiston still stands. It alone remains to show where\r\nthe birthplace of one of our great old families once stood, and is the\r\nonly remnant of the later home of the loyal house of Davison, two of\r\nwhom were slain at the storming of Newcastle in 1644.\r\n\r\nCotham Conyers, or Cotham Stob, derives its affix name\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAINFORD HALL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD HALL AT THORPE THEWLES.]\r\n\r\nfrom its erstwhile owners, the Conyers, and is another old gable-ended\r\nmanor-house. It stands, surrounded by elms, near to a brook. The rooms\r\nare wainscotted, and over the fireplace in one of the rooms there was a\r\nhunting scene on the panel, depicting a stag at bay. One of the upper\r\nrooms was hung with tapestry. The estate was forfeited by the Conyers\r\nthrough Ralph Conyers having taken part in the Earls’ rebellion in 1569.\r\nLying almost midway between the two Conyers’ seats of Cotham and\r\nSockburn stands the old home of the Killinghalls and Pembertons, at\r\nMiddleton St. George. The house formerly contained a painting, by\r\nFrancis Place, of \"A Pointer and Pheasants.\" An old cross in the garden\r\nis said to have been brought from Neasham Abbey.\r\n\r\nPassing to the west of Darlington again, near the highroad leading to\r\nStaindrop, stands Thornton Hall, for many years the residence of a\r\nbranch of the baronial family of Tailbois. It is a stone house, with\r\nhigh pitched gables, old-world red tiles, and mullioned windows, and has\r\nlong been used as a farmhouse. Above the window over the main entrance\r\nare two gargoyles. An interesting account of this house, with a number\r\nof good sketches, may be found in Mr. G. A. Fothergill’s _Sketch-book_.\r\n\r\nSeveral miles north of Thornton, a small old mansion with gables and\r\nmullions may be seen at School Aycliffe, and not very far away, in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction, the old grange of Midridge stands within an\r\nold walled garden, with a row of old elms leading along the road from\r\nthe south. The house is a large treble-gable-ended building, and is said\r\nto have been garrisoned by the Loyalist owner, Anthony Byerley, who was\r\na Colonel in the Royal army. His troopers are still locally known as\r\n\"Byerley’s Bull Dogs.\" A little to the south-west, the old house of\r\nNewbiggin stands low, with solid stone walls, and the main staircase of\r\nthe same substantial material. There was formerly a tower on the west\r\nend of the house.\r\n\r\nThe hall at Coxhoe, erected about the year 1725 by John Burdon, has a\r\nrichly decorated interior of contemporary date. In this house Elizabeth\r\nBarrett Browning was born on March 6, 1806.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of the county does not contain so many houses of\r\ninterest as the southern; there are, however, a few interesting\r\nmansions.\r\n\r\nFen Hall, near Lanchester, is an interesting old house,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEN HALL.]\r\n\r\ndating from the Stuart period. It has the Greenwell arms over the\r\nentrance, and is now fast falling into a ruinous condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORNER OF WASHINGTON HALL.]\r\n\r\nWashington Hall, a large, old stone mansion, built in the form of an E,\r\nwith high-pitched roof and gable-ends, stands to the south side of the\r\nlow hill on which the church is built. The lights are divided by stone\r\nmullions and transoms. It was erected by the family of James, possibly\r\nby the Bishop, and was, in Hutchinson’s time, the seat of the\r\nBracks.[17] It is now, like the old hall at Rainton, in a pitiable\r\nstate, and let in tenements.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Sunderland there are several interesting houses.\r\nHigh Barnes, for long the home of the Ettricks, is now a convent, and\r\nhas been considerably altered. Low Barnes, the Pembertons’ old home, is\r\nlet to a laundry company. Ford Hall is a comparatively modern house, but\r\nis interesting as having been the birthplace of General Havelock.\r\nPallion Hall, an old stone mansion, has recently been pulled down.\r\n\r\nThe old hall at West Boldon is more modern, having been erected in 1709\r\nby the Fawcetts. The house has the arms of that family over the main\r\nentrance, and several of the rooms are wainscotted. A quaint record of\r\nanother generation may well be noted in the late Mr. Boyle’s own words:\r\n\"On one of the window-panes in a bedroom, in a neat hand of the early\r\npart of last century, someone has written with a diamond:\r\n\r\n    \"Beautifull Grace Andrew.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next pane, in equally delicate script, another hand has added:\r\n\r\n    \"Fair written Name, yet fairer in my heart,\r\n     No Diamond cutts so deep as Cupid’s Dart.\"\r\n\r\nTravelling by railway from Boldon to Newcastle, the house now known as\r\nthe Mulberry Inn is a familiar object, just outside of Felling station.\r\nIt has been a picturesque building, and for long was the residence of\r\nthe Brandlings. It is now undergoing a serious alteration. A small\r\nstone summer-house, once in the garden, still stands on one of the\r\nstation platforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOORWAY, WEST RAINTON HALL.]\r\n\r\nKibblesworth Hall, a few miles south of Gateshead, is a solid Jacobean\r\nbrick house, with stone-mullioned, square-headed windows. It has a fine\r\noak staircase, and some of the fireplaces and cornices are of\r\ncontemporary date. The house has been let in tenements to the pitmen of\r\nthe adjoining colliery, the stables turned into cottages, and the\r\ngardens into allotments. Another old house that has undergone a similar\r\nfate is West Rainton Hall, erected about 1690 by Sir John Duck, Bart. It\r\nstands on the main street of the village, shorn of the battlements\r\nmentioned by Surtees, but still retaining a fine old doorway,\r\nreminiscent of its better days.\r\n\r\nThere are also in this district several other old houses dismantled and\r\nin tenements, betokening the scattering of their once owners to many far\r\nlands. It is a pleasure to turn from these to a few houses still in good\r\ncondition. The Hall,[18] Houghton-le-Spring, was perhaps erected by\r\nRobert Hutton, Rector of Houghton, between the years 1589 and 1623,\r\nalthough its erection is more popularly attributed to his grandson and\r\nnamesake. This later Robert Hutton was Captain of a troop of horse in\r\nthe Parliamentary army, and, like Dobson of Harlow Hill,\r\n\r\n      \" ... went to Dundee\r\n    And when he came back\r\n      held his head hee.\"\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds of this expedition he is supposed to have built the\r\nhouse in which his descendants dwelt for many generations. To satisfy\r\nsome scruple of his conscience, or, according to another story, to lie\r\nnear a favourite horse, he was buried in his garden under an altar-tomb,\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n     \"Hic Jacet Robertvs Hvtton armiger qvi obiit Avg die nono 1680. Et\r\n     moriendo vivet.\"\r\n\r\nStella Hall, a picturesque Elizabethan structure, situated close to the\r\nRiver Tyne, was erected by the Tempests on the site of a nunnery, and\r\nstill contains some tapestry representing the story of Hero and Leander.\r\n\r\nScattered up and down the dales are many other old homes that a writer\r\ndealing with his homeland would love to touch upon, but space forbids.\r\nEven these short notes are all too short. The old mansions of our\r\ncountryside are a much neglected feature of archæology, and each house\r\nin itself demands photographs and drawings and a chapter quite as long\r\nas this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDURHAM ASSOCIATIONS OF JOHN WESLEY\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. T. CYRIL DALE, B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nA packet of old letters suggests many questions as to the writers, whom\r\nthey have long survived. Nor is this curiosity diminished when one of\r\nthe correspondents has achieved a world-wide fame, so that there is no\r\nportion of the globe where his name is not known. For then one desires\r\nto know who were the people whom he honoured with his friendship, and to\r\nscan the letters closely to see if they throw any new light upon the\r\ncharacter of the writer. There are in existence seventeen letters\r\nwritten by John Wesley to a member of a family once well-known in the\r\ncounty of Durham. Originally there were thirty letters, as appears from\r\nthe numbering of those which remain, but where the other letters are the\r\nwriter does not know.[19] These seventeen letters, two of them being\r\nonly copies of the originals, came into the possession of the Rev.\r\nThomas Dale, Canon of St. Paul’s from 1843-70, and from him passed to\r\nhis eldest son, the Rev. Thomas Pelham Dale (1821-92), at one time\r\nwell-known as the Rector of St. Vedast in the city of London.[20] They\r\nwere written to Miss Margaret Dale, second daughter of Edward Dale[21]\r\nof Tunstall, who, owing to the extinction (as it seems) of the elder\r\nbranch of the family in the male line, was head of the family of Dale,\r\nfirst of Dalton le Dale, and then of Tunstall. This Edward Dale was the\r\nson of Thomas Dale by his wife Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of\r\nGeorge Middleton of Silksworth. Through her Burke, who was far too\r\namiable a genealogist to doubt the assertions of any one respecting his\r\nancestors, however remote, traces the descent of Edward Dale from\r\nGundreda, daughter of William the Conqueror. The curious will find the\r\ndescent set out at length in Burke’s _Royal Family_, Pedigree XVI.\r\nEdward Dale married Eleanor, youngest of the three daughters of the Rev.\r\nJohn Lawrence, Rector of Bishop’s Wearmouth. Mr. Lawrence (1668-1732)\r\nwas in his day a well-known writer on horticulture, and has, as a\r\nconsequence, a niche in that temple of fame--the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_. It is related that when in 1721 he was appointed to the\r\nRectory, he was so obnoxious to the principal inhabitants of his parish,\r\nowing to his Hanoverian proclivities, that when he was \"reading himself\r\nin\" the three chief landowners of the place--John Goodchild of Pallion,\r\nJohn Pemberton of Bainbridge Holme, and Thomas Dale of Tunstall--walked\r\nout of the church as a protest against his appointment.[22] By a kind of\r\npoetic justice, his three daughters married into the families of the\r\nthree protesters. His eldest daughter married the above-named John\r\nGoodchild, his two younger daughters the sons and heirs of John\r\nPemberton and Thomas Dale. Only unfortunately for the completeness of\r\nthe tale, the two last marriages did not take place till after the death\r\nof John Lawrence.\r\n\r\nBy Eleanor Lawrence, Edward Dale had three daughters--Mary, Margaret,\r\nand Anne--and one son, also called Edward. He died when his eldest\r\ndaughter was only eleven and his son still an infant.\r\n\r\nMargaret Dale no doubt made the acquaintance of John Wesley through his\r\ndevoted adherent, Margaret Lewen. Miss Lewen, the only child of Thomas\r\nLewen of Kibblesworth, while still a girl of about twenty-two, was\r\nattracted by the preaching of John Wesley during his visit to the North\r\nin the year 1764. Wesley, in his famous \"Diary,\" speaks of her as being\r\n\"a remarkable monument of Divine mercy. She broke through all\r\nhindrances, and joined heart and hand with the children of God.\" She was\r\n\"a pattern to all young women of fortune in England.\" Margaret Lewen was\r\ncertainly exceedingly liberal. \"In works of benevolence and Christian\r\nzeal, she cheerfully expended an ample income\" (Stamp: Orphan House of\r\nWesley, London, 1863). Wesley says she had about £600 a year \"in her own\r\nhands.\" On one of his visits to the North she gave him a chaise and a\r\npair of horses. Now, Margaret Lewen was very intimate with the Dale\r\ngirls, and it was probably through her influence that they came into\r\ncontact with the great preacher. Whether any letters were written to the\r\nother sisters is not known, but they can hardly have been so numerous or\r\nmore intimate than those written to Margaret Dale.\r\n\r\nThe first letter extant is written from Portpatrick, and is dated June\r\n1, 1765, when Margaret Dale was still two or three months short of\r\ntwenty-one. It begins: \"My Dear Miss Peggy,\" and ends, \"I trust you will\r\nbe happier every day; and that you will not forget, my Dear Sister, your\r\nAffectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\" The letter is occupied with spiritual\r\ncounsels, and questions about her spiritual health. He inquires: \"How\r\nfar do you find Power over your Thoughts? Does not your imagination\r\nsometimes wander? Do those imaginations continue for any time?\" It is\r\nclear, from Wesley’s next letter, written from Kilkenny, dated July 5,\r\n1765, that Miss Peggy had found she was guilty of wandering thoughts,\r\nfor the letter begins: \"My dear Sister,--Altho’ it is certain the kind\r\nof Wandering Thoughts wch you mention, are consistent with pure Love,\r\nyet it is highly desirable to be delivered from yᵐ, because (as you\r\nobserve) they hinder profitable thoughts.\" Miss Lewen is mentioned. \"I\r\nhope Miss Lewen and you speak to each other, not only without Disguise,\r\nbut without Reserve.\" The letter ends, \"My Dear Sister, your\r\naffectionate Brother.\"\r\n\r\nLetters 4 and 5 are missing. The next, numbered 6, is dated from London,\r\nNovember 6, 1765. Peggy has a fixed idea that she will not live beyond\r\nthe age of three and twenty. Wesley, in this letter, asks many questions\r\nabout this conviction. He wants to know when it began, and whether it\r\ncontinues the same, whether her health is better or worse. The subject\r\nis continued in the next letter, written December 31 in the same year.\r\nThis letter begins \"My dear Peggy,\" and ends, \"I cannot tell you how\r\ntenderly I am, my Dear Sister, your affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"\r\n\r\nWesley had evidently a tender paternal regard for the girl. He was in\r\n1765 sixty-two years of age, fifteen years older than her father would\r\nhave been if he had survived. Peggy was mistaken in her conviction. She\r\ndid not actually die till November, 1777, when she had completed her\r\nthirty-third year, so she was just ten years out. Letter 9, written\r\nApril, 1766, from Manchester, contains nothing of interest. Numbers 10\r\nand 11 are unfortunately missing. Number 12 shows that Peggy desired to\r\ngo to Leytonstone, where there was a considerable colony of Wesleyans,\r\nand whither perhaps Margaret Lewen had already gone. Wesley was very\r\nanxious she should not go. \"I am afraid,\" he writes, \"if you go to\r\nLaton-Stone you will give up Perfection. I mean by placing it so high,\r\nas I fear none will ever attain. I know _not one_ in London that has\r\never largely conversed with Sally Ryan, who has not given it up, that\r\nis, with regard to their own Experience. Now this, I think, would do\r\nyou no good at all. Nay, I judge, it wou’d do you much hurt: it would be\r\na substantial Loss. But I do not see how you _cou’d_ possibly avoid that\r\nloss, without a free intercourse with me, both in Writing and Speaking.\r\nOtherwise I know and feel, I can give you up, tho’ you are exceeding\r\nnear and dear to me. But if you was to be moved from your Stedfastness\r\nthat wᵈ give me pain indeed. You will write immediately to, my Dear\r\nPeggy, your Affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"\r\n\r\nThe next two letters are missing, so that we do not know if Peggy obeyed\r\nJohn Wesley or no, though from the tone of the next letter it seems\r\nprobable that she did so. The next letter is dated November 7, 1766.\r\nMargaret Lewen had died at Leytonstone, October 30. By her will, dated\r\nNovember 21, 1764, she left many legacies to various Methodist good\r\nworks, and to John Wesley £1,000, and her residuary estate to be applied\r\nas he should \"think fit for the furtherance of the Gospel.\" She left\r\nMary Dale £1,000, and to her sisters Margaret and Ann Dale, £100 apiece.\r\nHer father threatened to dispute the will, and the matter was\r\ncompromised by the surrender to him of the residuary estate.\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley refers to Margaret Lewen’s death in the fifteenth letter:\r\n\"How happy it is to sit loose to all below! Just now I find a paper on\r\nwch is wrote (in Miss Lewen’s hand), ‘March 24, 1762, Margaret Dale, Ann\r\nDale, Margaret Lewen, wonder in what state of life they will be in the\r\nyear 1766.’ How little did any of you think at that time that she would\r\nthen be in Eternity: But she now wonders at nothing and grieves at\r\nnothing.\" He ends: \"And sure neither Life nor Death shall separate you\r\nfrom, my Dear Sister, your Affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth letter--the sixteenth contains nothing of especial\r\ninterest, the seventeenth is missing--Wesley speaks of his followers at\r\nNewcastle: \"Those you mention are Israelites indeed to whom you will do\r\nwell to speak with all freedom. A few more in Newcastle are of the same\r\nspirit: Altho’ they are but few in whom ye Gold is free from dross. I\r\nwish you could help poor Molly Stralliger. I am often afraid for her\r\nlest she shᵈ be ignorant of Satan’s devices, and lose all that GOD had\r\nwrought in her.\"\r\n\r\nThe twentieth letter we give in full, not because it is more interesting\r\nthan the other letters, but because it has not before appeared in public\r\nprint.[23] The other letters will be found in the _Life and Letters of\r\nThomas Pelham Dale_, by his daughter, Helen Pelham Dale, published by\r\nGeorge Allen, 1894. The whereabouts of this letter was not then known,\r\nbut it has since been unearthed from a collection of autographs made by\r\na connection of the family. Possibly the other missing letters may be in\r\nother collections. The letter is dated from Athlone, June 19, 1767: \"My\r\ndear Peggy, By conversing with you, I should be overpaid for coming two\r\nor three hundred miles round about. But how it will be I know not yet.\r\nIf a ship be ready for Whitehaven, then I shall arrive at Whitehaven or\r\nNewcastle, otherwise I must sail for Holyhead or Chester. I hope you now\r\nagain find the increased witness that you are saved from sin. There is a\r\ndanger in being content without it, into which you may easily reason\r\nyourself. You may easily bring yourself to believe there is no need of\r\nit, especially while you are in an easy and peaceful state. But beware\r\nof this. The Witness of Sanctification as well as of Justification, is\r\nye privilege of God’s Children, and you may have the one always clear as\r\nwell as ye other if you walk humbly and closely with God. In what state\r\ndo you find your mind now? Full of Faith and Love? Praying always? Then\r\nI hope you always remember my Dear Peggy, Your affectionate Brother, J.\r\nWesley.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Wesley wrote again he had been to Newcastle and had seen Peggy.\r\nThe letter is dated from Witney, August 27, and is, as usual, very\r\naffectionate in tone: \"I thought it was hardly possible for me to love\r\nyou better than I did before I came last to Newcastle. But your artless,\r\nsimple, undisguised Affection exceedingly increased mine. At the same\r\ntime it increased my Confidence in you so that I feel you are\r\nunspeakably near and dear to me.\" He adds in a postscript, \"Don’t forget\r\nwhat you have learnt in Music.\" Possibly Peggy had been showing her\r\nfriend her accomplishments. Possibly, too, she had learnt her music from\r\na certain young man, Edward Avison, afterwards organist of St. Nicholas’\r\nChurch, Newcastle. If this were the case, her teacher taught Peggy\r\nsomething else beside music, for she afterwards married him.\r\n\r\nIn the next letter we get glimpses of two people famous in the Methodist\r\nworld of the day, George Whitefield, and Darcy, Lady Maxwell. Of George\r\nWhitefield it is unnecessary to speak. Lady Maxwell was the daughter of\r\nThomas Brisbane of Brisbane in Ayrshire, and the widow of Sir Walter\r\nMaxwell, fourth Baronet, of Pollock. Left a childless widow in 1757, she\r\nbecame a follower of John Wesley, though she did not formally join the\r\nMethodists till many years later. She provided the money for building\r\nthe school at Kingswood.\r\n\r\nWesley writes: \"I hope Mr. Whitefield was an instrument of good at\r\nNewcasle, and a means of stirring up Some. He is very affectionate and\r\nvery lively and his word seldom falls to the ground: tho’ he does not\r\nfrequently speak of the deep things of GOD, or the Height of ye\r\nPromises. But you say not one word of Lady Maxwell? Did she call at\r\nNewcastle going and coming? Did you converse with her alone? And did she\r\nbreak thro’ her Natural and habitual Shyness? How did you find her?\r\nSeeking Heavenly things alone, and all athirst for _God_? It will be a\r\nmiracle of miracles if she stands, considering the thousand snares that\r\nsurround her. I have much satisfaction when I consider in how different\r\na situation you and my Dear Molly Dale are. You have every outward\r\nAdvantage for Holiness wch an indulgent Providence can give.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence now begins to slacken. Peggy has accused him of not\r\nanswering her last letter; in reply Wesley writes from Liverpool, April\r\n1, 1768. \"I do not understand what Letter you mean. I have answer’d (if\r\nI do not forget) every letter which I have receiv’d, and I commonly\r\nanswer either of you within a day or two. In this respect, I do not love\r\nto remain in your debt. In others I must always be so, for I can never\r\npay you the Affection I owe. Accept of what little I have to give.... I\r\nhope to be at Glasgow on Wednesday the 19th instant, at Aberdeen ye\r\n28th, at Edinburgh May 5th, at Newcastle on Friday May 20th.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter dated June 30, 1768, may be described as a very brief\r\ntreatise on Sanctification. Then there is a gap of nearly a year, the\r\nnext letter being dated May 20, 1769. Peggy has had to endure a great\r\ntrial. Her sister Molly married a Mr. John Collinson of London. The\r\n_Newcastle Courant_ of April 29, 1769, thus announces the fact:\r\n\"Thursday, was married at St. Andrew’s, Mr. John Collinson of London to\r\nMiss Dale of Northumberland Street, daughter of the late Mr. Dale of\r\nTunstall, near Sunderland, a most agreeable young lady, endowed with\r\nevery qualification to render the marriage state happy, with a fortune\r\nof £2,000.\" But Peggy felt her sister’s defection much. Wesley was\r\nstrongly in favour of the single life both for men and women. He had\r\npublished a treatise in favour of celibacy, entitled _Thoughts on a\r\nSingle Life_. It is true that he himself afterwards married in the year\r\n1751, but, as his matrimonial experiences were distinctly unfortunate\r\n(he separated from his wife for ever after five years of married life),\r\nhe was not unnaturally more than ever firmly convinced of the advantage\r\nof celibacy.[25] Peggy was as yet quite sure that John Wesley was right\r\nin this as in everything else.\r\n\r\nHe comforts her thus: \"The hearing from my Dear Peggy at this critical\r\ntime gives me a particular satisfaction. I wanted to know, How you bore\r\nsuch a trial, a wound in the tenderest part. You have now a first proof\r\nthat the God whom you serve, is able to deliver you in every trial. You\r\nfeel and yet conquer.... I hope you are delivered not only from\r\n_repining_ with regard to Her, but from _reasoning_ with regard to\r\nyourself. You still see the more excellent way, and are sensible of the\r\nadvantages you enjoy. I allow _some_ single women have fewer Advantages\r\nfor Eternity than they might have in a married State. But, blessed be\r\nGOD you have all the Advantages wch one can well conceive.... O may you\r\nimprove every advantage to the uttermost. And give more and more comfort\r\nto, my Dear Peggy, your Affectionate Brother, J. Wesley.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one more letter from London, November 17, 1769, encouraging\r\nPeggy to persevere in her work for others. Then the letters cease.\r\nPerhaps there were more letters which have been lost, or were perchance\r\ndestroyed by the recipient. Wesley, with his zeal for celibacy, can\r\nhardly have liked the news of his Peggy’s engagement to Edward Avison.\r\nHe was organist of St. Nicholas’, Newcastle, in succession to his\r\nfather, Charles Avison,[26] once a well-known musician in the North of\r\nEngland. He was three years younger than Peggy. Their married life was\r\nshort. They were married March, 1773: Edward Avison died October, 1776,\r\naged twenty-nine; and Peggy in November, 1777, aged thirty-three. They\r\nleft no children. Their monument in the churchyard of St. Andrew’s\r\nChurch, Newcastle, says: \"They were eminent for piety and primitive\r\nsimplicity of manners; having each borne a lingering disease with the\r\nmost exemplary patience and resignation, they rejoiced at the approach\r\nof death.\" Perhaps Wesley visited Newcastle during the last year of his\r\ndear Peggy’s life, and was able to minister spiritual consolation to\r\nher. Let us hope that any breach that Peggy’s marriage may have made\r\nbetween her and one who loved her with so tender and paternal an\r\naffection was cured by the approach of Death, the great Healer.\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be said. Mary Collinson lived to 1812, and left a\r\nfamily of two sons, George Dale and John Collinson, and three daughters,\r\nAnn Collinson, Thermuthis Collinson, and Mary, the wife of Christopher\r\nGodmond. It is not known if any of her descendants are alive to-day; if\r\nthere be any such, they may very likely possess the missing letters. Ann\r\nDale never married, and lived till 1820. Edward, their brother, died in\r\n1826, having seen five of his six sons die before him without issue. His\r\neldest and only surviving son, also Edward, lived till 1862, and then\r\ndied childless. With him died out the senior branch of the family of\r\nDale of Dalton-le-Dale and Tunstall. Since his death there have been no\r\nDales of this family residing in the Bishopric. How the letters written\r\nby John Wesley came into the possession of Canon Dale, or Canon Dale’s\r\nfather, William Dale, is not known. Possibly Anne Dale gave them to\r\nWilliam Dale, or her brother may have given them to his son. It is\r\ncertain that to that son’s careful preservation of them we owe this\r\nintimate revelation of the great revivalist’s affection for a Durham\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD FAMILIES OF DURHAM\r\n\r\nBY HENRY R. LEIGHTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evil fate that has attended the old houses in this county has\r\nfollowed equally relentlessly the families who once dwelled therein.\r\nHere and there, it is true, a family still exists that has weathered the\r\nstorms of long centuries; one or two, perhaps, may be pointed out that\r\nhave increased their acreage as the long years went by; and perhaps\r\nanother two or three whose lands remain with daughters’ heirs.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, almost all the families of importance in feudal\r\ndays have passed away. The great House of Neville,[27] that once\r\nthreatened to overshadow the Lords Palatine themselves, survives only in\r\nseveral southern branches, and their name is almost forgotten in their\r\nnative land. The baronial houses of Eure,[28] Conyers, Hylton, and\r\nFitzMarmaduke have all passed away. So, too, have nearly all the names\r\nrecorded in the Heralds’ Visitations at intervals from 1530 to 1666. Of\r\nthe latter, eight only retain their patrimonial acres. These are the\r\nChaytors, Edens, Lambtons, Liddells, Lumleys, Salvins, Vanes, and\r\nWhartons. To these may be added the Williamsons, who came from\r\nNottinghamshire, and the Shaftos from Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThe Visitations of Durham[29] are, like those of the sister county of\r\nNorthumberland, notoriously incomplete. Of the latter, Surtees wrote:\r\n\"The Northumbrian gentry, many of whom probably never heard of the\r\nVisitation, would scarcely leave their business or amusements to attend\r\nan Officer of Arms for a purpose of which few then saw the utility, and\r\nwhich, it is plain, in many instances was considered an extreme\r\nnuisance.\" In the adjoining county to the south there was a similar\r\nstate of affairs. Of Dugdale’s _Visitation of York_, Mr. Davies wrote:\r\n\"Nearly one-third of the whole number of gentry whom the herald called\r\nupon to appear before him with proofs of their arms and pedigrees\r\ntreated his summonses with neglect.\"\r\n\r\nIn this county both a long and a strong list of families of gentle blood\r\ncan easily be enumerated who, for one reason or another, make no\r\nappearance in the Heralds’ books. No one familiar with the history of\r\nthe county can have helped remarking the absence of families formerly so\r\nwell known, and in many cases still well known, as the Allgoods of\r\nBradley, Blacketts of Hoppyland, Bromleys of Nesbitt, Dales of Dalton,\r\nDouthwaites of Westholme, Emersons of Westgate, Goodchilds of Pallion,\r\nGreenwells of Greenwell and Stobilee, Holmeses of Wearmouth, Hunters of\r\nMedomsley, Ironsides of Houghton, Meaburns of Pontop, and others whose\r\nnames spin out too long a list to give in full. Now, most of these\r\nfamilies had intermarried with families who registered and had written\r\nthemselves as \"gentlemen\" for several generations; and, as an\r\ninteresting sidelight upon the Visitations, we believe it could be shown\r\nthat more than one family who registered was in debt pretty heavily to\r\nothers who didn’t register. So it does not appear to have been\r\naltogether a matter of means.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be as well, before proceeding farther, to notice the\r\nprincipal material we have, in addition to the Visitations, for proving\r\nthe succession to estate in this county.\r\n\r\nDurham, being a separate regality, is not included in the Domesday Book,\r\nand our earliest record is the Boldon Book, dated some years later,\r\nbeing compiled by order of Bishop Pudsey in 1183. Later there is a\r\nsurvey of the county, made by order of Bishop Hatfield, who ruled from\r\n1345 to 1381. From the time of Bishop Beaumont (1318-33) the succession\r\nmay be proved by the inquisitions post-mortem taken upon the death of\r\nevery owner. These documents were formerly kept at Durham, but are now,\r\nwith many other local records, in London.\r\n\r\nWith these must be mentioned the Halmote Rolls, commencing in 1349,\r\ncontaining a record of all holders of the Bishop’s lands and other\r\nrecords of the cursitors. The Durham Chancery Proceedings, also now in\r\nthe Record Office, are full of the most interesting information\r\nrespecting local families.\r\n\r\nThe wills of residents in the Bishopric from the sixteenth century\r\nonwards are of great value. A few also of the parish registers within\r\nthe diocese commence towards the end of the same century, but the\r\nmajority do not date with any regularity until another hundred years had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nLimited space forbids any lengthy account of the families individually,\r\nand a few passing notices must suffice. Amongst the existing\r\n\"indigenous\" families, as Surtees calls them, the Lumleys must bear the\r\npalm, not for length of pedigree, but for the long period they have\r\nranked amongst the greater nobility.\r\n\r\nProbably for some generations before, and certainly from, the days of\r\nUchtred, Lord of Lumley, _temp._ King Stephen, the family has held high\r\nrank. Marmaduke de Lumley, who was in right of his mother one of the\r\ncoheirs of the barony of Thweng, made an interesting change in the\r\nfamily arms. His father had borne a scarlet shield with six silver\r\npopinjays, whilst his mother’s family arms were a golden shield, thereon\r\na fess gules. Marmaduke dispensed with three of the popinjays, and\r\nplaced his mother’s fess between the remaining three, two above it and\r\none below. His son Sir Ralph, the builder of the castle at Lumley, was\r\nsummoned to Parliament as a Baron in the eighth year of Richard II.’s\r\nreign. Yorkist in sympathy, he joined in an unfortunate attempt to\r\noverthrow the fourth Henry in the year that monarch grasped the throne,\r\nand was killed at Cirencester in a skirmish. One of his younger sons,\r\nMarmaduke, was successively Bishop of Carlisle and Lincoln, and Lord\r\nHigh Treasurer of England. John de Lumley, Sir Ralph’s second but eldest\r\nsurviving son, was restored to his father’s estates by King Henry,\r\nbecame a distinguished leader in the French wars, and was slain on the\r\nfield of Baugé in 1421. The successor, his only son Thomas, was summoned\r\nto Parliament in his grandfather’s barony in 1461, the attainder of the\r\nlatter being reversed upon petition.\r\n\r\nThird in descent from the last-named peer, John, the fifth Baron, took\r\npart in the great victory of Flodden. He lived to see his son and heir,\r\nGeorge Lumley, beheaded for high treason, and attainted, for taking part\r\nin the Pilgrimage of Grace.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lumley’s son, John Lumley, was recreated a Peer in 1547, his\r\nfather’s attainder being reversed. This John, Lord Lumley, must have\r\nbeen something of an Oriental in his philosophy. He was strongly imbued\r\nwith the spirit of ancestor-worship. It was he who brought two stone\r\nmonuments from Durham Abbey under the belief that they were of his\r\nforefathers, and set them up with a long line of effigies representing\r\nevery generation of his house from a remote period. The rooms at Lumley\r\nwere also hung with a series of portraits of the same individuals by his\r\ndirection. About the origin of these the late Mr. Planché advanced an\r\ninteresting theory, printed in 1866, in the _Journal of the British\r\nArchæological Association_.\r\n\r\nLord Lumley appears to have impressed his family importance upon William\r\nJames, the contemporary Bishop of Durham, whose repetition of the\r\npedigree so astonished that modern Solomon, King James I., that the\r\nlatter evidently thought the Bishop was taking a rise out of him. \"By my\r\nsaul, I didna ken Adam’s name was Lumley!\" said the Sovereign. Doubtless\r\nthis was a natural exclamation, for it was the King’s first meeting with\r\na pedigree drawn up by an Elizabethan Herald. He would meet others as he\r\ntravelled farther South!\r\n\r\nThe estates passed on the death of this peer to a second cousin, Sir\r\nRichard Lumley. Created in 1628 a Viscount in the Peerage of Ireland,\r\nSir Richard in later years was known as a gallant Royalist, and one of\r\nPrince Rupert’s trusted officers.\r\n\r\nHis son, another Richard, one of the commanders of the Royal army at\r\nSedgemoor, was advanced in 1690 to the Earldom of Scarborough. Little\r\nmore remains to be said, beyond that Lumleys have taken part in almost\r\nevery war since that date (one, Sir William, commanded the cavalry at\r\nAlbuera; and another, a captain in the navy, was killed on the _Isis_ in\r\n1782), and that Lumley Castle is still the seat of the Earls of\r\nScarborough.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the Lumleys by marriage, the Lambtons have owned the\r\nadjoining estate of Lambton from the twelfth century. Their connection\r\nwith the curious legend of the Lambton Worm has made the name widely\r\nknown in the North. From the fifteenth century onwards the family were\r\nperhaps most remarkable for the brilliant series of marriages the\r\nsuccessive owners of the estate made. Matches with Rokeby of Rokeby,\r\nLumley of Ludworth, the Lords Eure, the Tempests of Stella, and the\r\nCurwens of Workington, each either bringing additional lands to the\r\nhouse, or else widening and extending the family influence, came to a\r\nclimax with the marriage of Ralph Lambton, in 1696, with Dorothy\r\nHedworth, heiress to great estates on the north bank of the river. The\r\ngreat-grandson of this marriage was the celebrated Radical Earl of\r\nDurham, whose life has been told in recent years by Mr. Stuart Reid.\r\n\r\nThe Greenwells are the third ancient house in this county who still\r\ndwell on the lands from which they take their name. At the time our\r\nearliest record, the Boldon Book, was compiled, William the Priest[30]\r\nheld lands at Greenwell, in the green valley of Wolsingham, and his\r\nsons, James and Richard de Greenwell, took their surname from their\r\nhome. From their generation through long centuries Greenwell succeeded\r\nGreenwell, until the death of Henry Greenwell in 1890. The estate then\r\npassed to his brother’s daughter, Mrs. Fletcher, who sold Greenwell\r\nwithin the last few years to her kinsman, Sir Walpole Eyre Greenwell,\r\nBart.\r\n\r\nLike other families, as the years passed by, younger sons founded\r\nbranches, some of which flourished and became even more influential than\r\nthe parent stem.\r\n\r\nAnthony Greenwell, a son of Peter Greenwell of Wolsingham, and grandson\r\nof Peter Greenwell of Greenwell, living in the reign of Henry VIII., is\r\nstated to have settled at Corbridge, in the adjoining county of\r\nNorthumberland. His son Ralph became allied by marriage to a number of\r\ninfluential families; the administration issued after the death of his\r\nfather-in-law, Ralph Fenwick of Dilston, in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN LAMBTON.]\r\n\r\n1623, showing that the latter left five daughters, his coheirs. Of\r\nthese, Isabel, the eldest, married Ralph Greenwell, Mary married John\r\nSwinburne, Agnes was wife to John Orde, Margaret to George Tempest of\r\nWinlaton, and Barbara married William Harrison.\r\n\r\nRalph’s grandson Nicholas, so named after his mother’s father Nicholas\r\nLeadbitter of Warden, married, in 1683, Frances Whitfield, and their\r\nson, Whitfield Greenwell, a captain in the army, was killed at the\r\nBattle of Glenshiels in 1719. From his grandson, John Greenwell, of the\r\nIndia House, the present Sir Walpole Greenwell is lineally descended.\r\n\r\nA second branch of the family has long been known as the Greenwells of\r\nGreenwell Ford, thus curiously taking their name from the old home in\r\nWolsingham parish and giving it to the new (though its very newness has\r\nnow grown green with age) home near Lanchester.\r\n\r\nThomas Greenwell, probably a younger son of John Greenwell of Greenwell,\r\nliving _circa_ 1440, took up his abode at Stobilee, in the parish of\r\nSatley (the vill of which had been held in chief in the early days of\r\nthe fourteenth century by Robert de Greenwell), and there his\r\ndescendants resided until the time of the Commonwealth, when the then\r\nhead of the family, William Greenwell, was sequestered as a Royalist,\r\nhis lands being taken from him, and let to Henry Blackett by the\r\nParliamentary Commissioners.\r\n\r\nNicholas Greenwell, a younger brother of the Royalist William, founded\r\nthe house of Ford, purchasing that estate in 1633. He married at\r\nMedomsley, in 1623, Mary Kirkley, probably a near relative of Michael\r\nKirkley of Newcastle, whose daughter married the first Sir William\r\nBlackett. This Michael Kirkley mentions in his will, which he made in\r\n1620, amongst other relatives, his cousin, Mr. William Greenwell the\r\nelder, of London, merchant, to whom William Camden, the Herald, had\r\nconfirmed in 1602 \"the antient armes of the worshipfull family of\r\nGreenwell, of Grenewell Hill, in the County Palatine of Duresme, from\r\nwhich the said William Greenwell is descended.\" This London branch of\r\nthe family ended with an heiress, who married Thomas Legh, of Ridge, in\r\nCheshire.\r\n\r\nReturning to Nicholas Greenwell of Ford, he died in 1640, and was buried\r\namongst his ancestors at Lanchester. His son, another William, added\r\nlands at Kibblesworth to the paternal estate by marriage with an heiress\r\nof the Cole family. He died at an advanced age in 1701, when his eldest\r\nson, Nicholas, succeeded to Greenwell Ford, whilst Kibblesworth passed\r\nto his younger son, Robert. The latter was great-grandfather of the late\r\nMajor-General Sir Leonard Greenwell, K.C.B., who, in 1820, acted as\r\ngodfather to the present venerable head of the family, the author of\r\nGreenwell’s Glory, one of, if not, the best trout flies known.\r\n\r\nOther branches of the family have flourished for awhile and then\r\ndisappeared. In 1697 William Greenwell of Whitworth acquired a moiety,\r\nincluding the mansion-house of Great Chilton, where his descendants\r\nlived for some three generations. One of his daughters married Cuthbert\r\nSmith, whose brother Ralph became his heir. This hunting squire\r\nbequeathed his property, for no other reason but that they had often\r\nridden together\r\n\r\n    \"From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view,\r\n     From the view to the death in the morning,\"\r\n\r\nto Robert Surtees of Milkwellburn.\r\n\r\nAt a much earlier date another William Greenwell owned a fair estate at\r\nNeasham, and dying in 1619 left two daughters, Margaret aged three and\r\nEleanor two years, as his heirs. His widow married Marmaduke Wyville,\r\nand the daughters respectively became the wives of John Taylor of\r\nAppleton, and Ralph Hedworth of Pokerley.\r\n\r\nOne other branch, still surviving, must not be passed over. The estate\r\nof Broomshields near to Satley has belonged to Greenwells from as far\r\nback as 1488, when one of the many Peters lived there. The\r\nrepresentation of the Maddisons of Hole House in the Derwent Valley, a\r\nfamily celebrated in local history and ballad, passed into this family\r\nby marriage in 1774. A later owner of Broomshields, John Greenwell,\r\nmarried Elizabeth, daughter of Alan Greenwell of Ford, and thus\r\nre-united the two families.\r\n\r\nMany years have passed since Robert Surtees wrote: \"_Sic transit._ We\r\nknow not what are become of the descendants of Bulmer, whose ancestors\r\nheld Brancepeth and Middleham Castles. The family of Conyers, which has\r\nhad Parliamentary lords, and once consisted of nine or ten flourishing\r\nbranches (excepting some remains in the South), is reduced to a single\r\nBaronet’s title without a fortune, and the probable descendants of\r\nSurtees of Dinsdale are ignorant of their own origin, whilst the chief\r\nmale line is either extinct or steeped in poverty and oblivion.\"\r\n\r\nThe great house of Surtees derives, as its name implies, its origin from\r\na family resident to a remote period on the banks of the River Tees.\r\nWilliam, the son of Siward, was living there in the reign of Henry II.,\r\nand his son Ralph was the first to style himself Sur Tees, the family\r\nresidence being then, as for many long years afterwards, at Dinsdale,\r\nthe adjoining seat to Sockburn where the Conyers family dwelt.\r\n\r\nOf the dissolution of this head house of the race, Mr. Surtees added: \"I\r\ndiscovered by a remarkable deed at Durham (unknown to Hutchinson) how\r\nthe estates went to Brandling in prejudice of Marmaduke, heir male of\r\nthe half-blood; and that Marmaduke’s grandson Thomas sold most of what\r\nremained in the male line; but I cannot find further as to this Thomas\r\nexcept that his younger brother Richard married and had two sons, Robert\r\nand Richard, who are the last I can trace of this branch, the undoubted\r\ndirect heirs.\"\r\n\r\nThe existing branches of this old family now resident at Redworth Hall,\r\nMainsforth, and Hamsterley, derive their descent from a William Surtees\r\nwho, in the year 1440, acquired lands in Whickham under the Halmote\r\nCourt, his sureties being Robert Boutflower and Thomas Gibson.\r\n\r\nHis descendants for some generations resided within the parishes of\r\nWhickham in this county, and Ovingham in Northumberland.\r\n\r\nEdward Surtees strengthened the family by marrying in 1617 Margaret\r\nCoulson, whose mother was sister and heir of Robert Surtees, Alderman\r\nand twice Mayor of Durham.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of this marriage was ancestor of the famous beauty, Bessy\r\nSurtees, who ran away with and married John Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon\r\nand Chancellor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe second son, Robert Surtees of Ryton, added to his inheritance by\r\nmarrying an heiress of the Hauxley family. He purchased Mainsforth and\r\nfounded the two families now owning that seat and Redworth, and amongst\r\nhis descendants was Robert Surtees the historian, to whom his native\r\ncounty owes an everlasting debt.\r\n\r\nThe Surtees of Hamsterley Hall trace their descent from a Cuthbert\r\nSurtees of Ebchester who died in 1622, and whose relationship to the\r\nOvingham family is not at present clear. His son Anthony, however, held\r\nthe Hollins in Ovingham parish in 1629, and that property in 1586 was in\r\nthe possession of Rowland Surtees, who died the following year, and who\r\nwas brother of William Surtees, ancestor of the families already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nHamsterley descended to Robert Smith Surtees, the author of some\r\nwell-known sporting novels.\r\n\r\nThe Edens are almost certainly an indigenous family, for there can be\r\nbut little doubt that they derive their name from the village of Eden,\r\nnow called Castle Eden. The family for a number of generations resided\r\nat Preston-on-Tees,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOPPYLAND PARK.]\r\n\r\nwhere lands were held by Robert de Eden in 1413. A succession of\r\nThomases and Williams bring the pedigree into the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen John Eden married an heiress of the Lambtons. After the heads of\r\nthe house successively increased the family patrimony by marrying\r\nheiresses of the Hutton, Welbury, and Bee families, John Eden’s\r\ngreat-great-grandson, Robert by name, followed his ancestor’s example by\r\nmarrying another Lambton heiress. He was Member for the county and was\r\ncreated a Baronet in 1672. Sir Robert Eden, the third Baronet, had a\r\nlarge and distinguished family. His second son Robert was Governor of\r\nMaryland, and created a Baronet in 1776. He was ancestor of the present\r\nSir William Eden, who succeeded also to the inheritance of the\r\nfirst-named Sir Robert’s eldest son, and is thus doubly a Baronet. The\r\nGovernor’s next brother, Sir Robert’s third son, was the distinguished\r\nstatesman, William Lord Auckland, and the fifth son, Sir Morton Eden, an\r\neminent diplomatist, was created Baron Henley, and was ancestor of the\r\npresent peer. One of the sisters of this talented trio married John\r\nMoore, Archbishop of Canterbury, and another married the Rev. Richard\r\nRichardson, Chancellor of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nSeveral old families have for many generations dwelt in the Valley of\r\nthe Derwent, and were all more or less intermarried with each other.\r\n\r\nThomas Hunter, about the end of the fourteenth century, married Margaret\r\nLayton, heiress, through her mother, of the family of Alanshields of\r\nAlanshields. A century later quite a small clan of the Hunters were\r\nresident up and down the valley, but principally at Medomsley. Here in\r\n1675 was born Dr. Christopher Hunter, the celebrated antiquary; and here\r\nnearly a century later, in 1757, General Sir Martin Hunter, G.C.M.G.,\r\nfirst saw the light.\r\n\r\nThe Stevensons were another Derwentside family, whose name is best known\r\nthrough John Hall, the _Eugenius_ of Sterne, having taken it when he\r\nmarried the heiress of Ambrose Stevenson of Byerside.\r\n\r\nThe Shaftos have in various branches been closely connected with the\r\ncounty for many centuries. The late Rev. John Hodgson, in an early\r\nvolume of the _Archæologia Æliana_, throws doubt upon the traditional\r\ndescent of the Shaftos in the male line from the Folliots. He\r\noverlooked, however, several important facts that at least render the\r\nassertion possible. The Fenwick of which the Folliots were Lords is not\r\nthe Fenwick in Northumberland as he assumed, but the place of that name\r\nin Yorkshire which passed by the marriage of Margaret Folliot to her\r\nhusband, Sir Hugh Hastings, and long continued in his family.\r\n\r\nCuthbert, son of John Folliot of Fenwick, is said to have acquired lands\r\nat Shafto in Northumberland by marrying one of the heirs of Roger\r\nWelwick of that place, and his descendants took the local name; another\r\ndaughter of Roger is stated in the Visitation of Rutland, 1618, to have\r\nmarried a Bryan Harbottle. A comparison of the arms of the respective\r\nfamilies shows that the Shafto coat is merely the Folliot arms\r\ndifferenced. Jordan Folliot in 1295 bore _gules a bend argent_, and\r\nRobert de Shaftowe, a contemporary, bore _gules on a bend argent, three\r\nmullets azure_.\r\n\r\nThe Shaftos of Tanfield Leigh in this county recorded their pedigree at\r\nthe Visitation of 1615. Le Neve continued the family for several\r\ngenerations. James Shafto, aged eight, in 1615 married a sister of Sir\r\nJohn Jackson of Harraton, and his son was living in 1707, and then\r\ndescribed as very poor. His son, again, a third James, married a\r\ndaughter of Sir Thomas Sandford, and had three sons, after whom the\r\ndescent is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe family now resident at Whitworth Park are an early offshoot of the\r\nShaftos of Bavington in Northumberland. They have several times\r\nintermarried with the Edens, and, like that family, are very rich in\r\nquarterings. Their escutcheon includes the arms of the Cavendishes,\r\nDukes of Newcastle; the Lords Ogle, and many other great houses. Within\r\nthe last century Beamish Park, near Chester-le-Street, has become the\r\nseat of another branch of the same family.\r\n\r\nThe Salvins of Croxdale are another of our old historic families who\r\nhave held the same acres for generations. They have lived at their\r\npresent home from the early days of the fifteenth century. In the time\r\nof King Charles they were gallant Loyalists, and two of them were killed\r\nin the King’s service.\r\n\r\nThe Whartons have also resided near to Durham for a good many centuries.\r\nThey descend from the Whartons of Wharton in Westmorland, and their\r\narmorial insignia is interesting both in its origin and as illustrating\r\nthe close alliance often existing between families bearing similar arms.\r\nAmongst the Normans who settled in this country after the Conquest was a\r\nfamily named Flamanville, often abbreviated into Flamville, who took\r\ntheir name from their lordship of that name in the province of La Manche\r\nin Normandy, and gave it as a suffix to their new Leicester estate of\r\nAston. Their coat of arms was simply _la manche_, the sleeve, and so the\r\nname originally applied to the curious geographical shape of a peninsula\r\ncame to be a familiar term in English heraldry. They intermarried with\r\nthe Conyers and the Hastings, and both these families adopted the\r\n_manche_ as their emblem. An heiress of the latter family married a\r\nWharton, and to this day a silver _manche_ or _maunch_ on a black field\r\nis the Wharton arms.\r\n\r\nDr. Wharton of Old Park, a lineal ancestor of the Dryburn family, is\r\ncelebrated as one of the courageous physicians who continued to visit\r\nthe sick during the Great Plague of London. One of his descendants, Dr.\r\nThomas Wharton, was the friend of the poet Thomas Gray, who visited him\r\nat Old Park.\r\n\r\nThe name of Burdon is an old one in the county, and probably derived\r\nfrom one or other of the local villages of that name. There were Burdons\r\nat Helmdon centuries ago, and for a number of generations Burdens have\r\nowned Castle Eden. The curious articles on the family arms, described by\r\nsome writers as organ-pipes, are said to be in reality palmers’ staffs,\r\nand are so used by the present family.\r\n\r\nOne branch of the Ords, who are a Northumbrian, or more correctly a\r\nNorth Durham, family, must not be passed over. In the reign of James I.\r\nJohn Ord acquired property at Fishburn, and founded the house who have\r\nfor so long dwelt at Sands Hall, beside Sedgefield.\r\n\r\nAnother family of Northumbrian extraction are the Blenkinsopps of\r\nHoppyland, who are, however, in the male line descended from the Leatons\r\nor Leightons of Benfieldside. Hoppyland was purchased from the Blacketts\r\nin 1768 by William Leaton of Gibside, agent to the Bowes family.\r\n\r\nThe Blacketts, who now reside at Wylam in Northumberland, held Hoppyland\r\nfor several generations. Their ancestor, Edward Blackett, of Shildon,\r\nmarried for his second wife a daughter of the famous Lilburne family of\r\nThickley-Puncharden, and a near relative of \"Freeborn John.\" The Baronet\r\nfamily, who now own the old Conyers estate of Sockburn, are also\r\ndescended from this Edward, and are rather curiously derived from the\r\nlatter family. The first baronet’s wife was a daughter of Michael\r\nKirkley of Newcastle, whose wife’s grandmother, Marion Anderson, was a\r\nlineal descendant of William Conyers of Wynyard.[31]\r\n\r\nRavensworth Castle, near Gateshead, has been the home of the Liddell\r\nfamily since 1607. The third owner of the name was created a Baronet by\r\nKing Charles I. in 1642, and was a strong Royalist during the troubled\r\nyears of that King’s reign. Since then the family has twice held\r\npeerages. Sir Henry Liddell was created Baron Ravensworth in 1747, but\r\nas he had no children the title became extinct at his death in 1784.\r\nHis great-nephew, Sir Thomas Henry Liddell, took the same title on his\r\nelevation to the peerage in 1821.\r\n\r\nTwo members of the Ravensworth family have left names well known in the\r\nliterary world. The second Baron, son and namesake of the first, was the\r\nauthor of a translation into English lyric verse of the _Odes of\r\nHorace_, and, in conjunction with Mr. Richards, he published in blank\r\nverse a translation of the last six books of Virgil’s _Æneid_. He was\r\ncreated Earl of Ravensworth, a title that died with his son, when the\r\nBarony passed to a cousin. The Very Rev. Henry George Liddell, Dean of\r\nChrist Church, Oxford, and some time Vice-Chancellor of that University,\r\nwas one of the compilers of the well-known Greek lexicon.\r\n\r\nThe Bowes family was once as widely scattered over Durham as the\r\nConyers. Streatlam Castle and Gibside, Bradley Hall, Biddick, and\r\nThornton Hall, were all residences of the Boweses at one time. One\r\nbranch only in the male line survives, and is now resident at Croft.\r\nStreatlam and Gibside, however, still belong to descendants in the\r\nfemale line--the Earls of Strathmore--who have added the name of their\r\nDurham ancestors to the paternal surname of Lyon.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated members of this family was _Old_ Sir William\r\nBowes, whose devotion to the young wife he lost, when he was about\r\ntwenty-eight years old, has caused him to be celebrated amongst true\r\nlovers. He lived to a great age, and never remarried.\r\n\r\nA descendant of his, Sir George Bowes, is celebrated in local rhyme as--\r\n\r\n    \"Cowardy! cowardy! Barney Castle,\"\r\n\r\na most erroneous term, for he was, in very truth, a loyal and gallant\r\ngentleman, whose brave defence of Barnard Castle in a time of strife and\r\nrebellion perhaps saved England for Queen Elizabeth. But the Boweses\r\nhave always, like most of our real old families, been a brave old race,\r\nand fully up to their motto: _In multis, in magnis, in bonis expertus_.\r\n\r\nThe Chaytors are descended from a certain John Chaytor, of Newcastle,\r\nmerchant, whose widow remarried William Wilkinson, another merchant in\r\nthe same old city.\r\n\r\nThe widow of both made her will on March 23, 1558-59, and in it, after\r\ndesiring to be buried in All Saints’ Church, Newcastle, beside her last\r\nlord, mentions her two sons, Christopher and John, and her daughter,\r\nJane Kirkhouse. John Chaytor the younger married a daughter of James\r\nPerkinson, and left two children, Elizabeth and John, living in 1579.\r\n\r\nChristopher Chaytor became an important public man, and, besides\r\nacquiring the Manor of Butterby, near Durham, gathered into the family\r\nfold the great estate of the noble old house of Clervaux, of Croft, and\r\nfounded the present Baronet Chaytors. His son Thomas married a daughter\r\nof Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bart., of Stella; and his son again, Nicholas\r\nChaytor, was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Army under the famous\r\nfighting Marquess of Newcastle, and by his wife, a Lambton heiress, was\r\nfather of Sir William, created a Baronet in 1671. This baronetcy became\r\nextinct on the death of the first holder in 1720, but was again revived\r\nwhen Sir William Chaytor was created a Baronet in 1801.\r\n\r\nThe Tempests, as already mentioned, were relatives of the Chaytors. They\r\ncame into the county from Yorkshire, when Sir William Tempest, of\r\nStudley, married the heiress of the Washingtons of Washington. His\r\nnatural son, Rowland, acquired a considerable estate by marrying one of\r\nthe many coheirs of the great baronial family of Umphreville, and was\r\nancestor of the various families of the name seated in this county.\r\n\r\nSir Nicholas Tempest, of Stella Hall, in the reign of James I., was\r\ncreated a Baronet, and was buried at Ryton in 1625.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] Portrait of Sir George Bowes\r\n\r\n(_From the painting at Streatlam Castle_)]\r\n\r\nHis younger brother, Rowland Tempest, was ancestor of the Tempests of\r\nthe Isle and Old Durham, whose representative some hundred years later,\r\nJohn Tempest, who was many years M.P. for the city of Durham, left a\r\ndaughter Frances, who became eventually heiress of this branch of the\r\nfamily. She married the Rev. Sir Henry Vane, Bart., Prebendary of Durham\r\nCathedral, a descendant of the famous Sir Henry Vane the elder, and her\r\nson, assuming his mother’s name, became Sir Henry Vane-Tempest. He left\r\nan only daughter, Frances Anne Emily, who married the third Marquess of\r\nLondonderry as his second wife, and was grandmother of the present\r\nMarquess.\r\n\r\nThe Vanes, who descend from a common ancestor with the Earls of\r\nWestmorland, have only been connected with Durham since the reign of\r\nJames I., when Sir Henry Vane, of Hadlo Castle, a Kentish knight,\r\nacquired Raby Castle by grant from the Crown. His youngest son was\r\nancestor of the Marquesses of Londonderry, and his eldest son was\r\nancestor of the late Duke of Cleveland and of the present Lord Barnard.\r\n\r\nThe Williamsons came into this county through a strange decree of fate.\r\nThe estate of Monkwearmouth passed from its purchaser, Colonel George\r\nFenwick, of Brinkburn, the well-known Puritan, to his daughter Dorothy,\r\nwho married Sir Thomas Williamson, of East Markham, in Nottinghamshire.\r\nSir Thomas belonged to a Cavalier family that had lost much in the Royal\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nSir William, the fourth Baronet, married a sister of Mrs. Lambton, of\r\nLambton, and co-heiress of John Hedworth, of Harraton, whose wife was a\r\ndescendant of William James, sometime Bishop of Durham.

The Empire, of course, means\r\nthat great medieval constitution of Central Europe corresponding very\r\nroughly indeed to Germany. The German Empire, as we know it, only dates\r\nfrom 1870.\r\n\r\n[2] This important matter, with its bearing upon the Palatinate Power,\r\nwas first noticed by Mr. K. C. Bayley, _Victoria County History_, ii.\r\n137.\r\n\r\n[3] See Dr. Lapsley’s book, _The County Palatine of Durham_, which\r\nforms a very able survey of the development of the whole system.\r\n\r\n[4] Dr. Lapsley describes Boldon Book in the _Victoria County History\r\nof Durham_, vol. i. See also ii. 179.\r\n\r\n[5] See Dr. Bradshaw’s account of the Black Death and its effect in the\r\n_Victoria County History_, ii. 209-222.\r\n\r\n[6] No account of the legends of Durham would be complete without some\r\nnote upon Robert Surtees’ ballads, several of which he foisted upon the\r\nunsuspecting Walter Scott as genuine antiques. Perhaps the most weird\r\nand effective is the one generally known as the \"Legend of Sir John le\r\nSpring,\" the scene of which is in Houghton, the _alma mater_ of the\r\npoet’s own schoolboy days. One or two of the verses, which are well\r\nknown in the North, run:\r\n\r\n    \"Pray for the sowle of Sir John-le-Spring,\r\n      When the black monks sing--\r\n      And the Vesper bells ring;\r\n    Pray for the sprite of a murdered Knight,\r\n    Pray for the sowle of Sir John-le-Spring.\r\n      He fell not, before the....--♰\r\n      The waning crescent fled,\r\n    When the Martyr’s palm and golden crown\r\n      Reward Christ’s soldier dead.\r\n\r\n    \"He fell not in the battle-field,\r\n    Beneath St. George’s banner bright,\r\n    When the pealing cry of victory--\r\n      Might cheer the sowle of a dying knight;\r\n      But at dead of night, in the soft moonlight,\r\n    In his garden bower--he lay;\r\n      And the dew of sleep, did his eyelids steep\r\n    In the arms of his leman gay.\r\n\r\n    \"And by murderous hand, and bloody brand,\r\n        In that guilty bower--\r\n        With his paramour,\r\n      Did his sowle from his body fleet,\r\n    And through mist and mirk, and moonlight gray,\r\n    Was forc’d away from the bleeding clay,\r\n      To the dreaded judgment seat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] This is proved by an inquest taken at Hilton in that year. _Cf._\r\nBishop Swaby’s _History of the Hiltons of Hilton Castle_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[8] _The River-Names of Europe_, pp. 33, 34.\r\n\r\n[9] Pudsey commenced to build a Lady Chapel at the east end of the\r\nchurch which, as was said, St. Cuthbert shook down.\r\n\r\n[10] About the year 1800 the whole cathedral underwent a process of\r\nchiselling, in order to render the surface uniform. This was done\r\nunder the superintendence of Wyatt, and in some parts four inches in\r\ndepth were removed by the operation. The evidence of this is apparent\r\nin several places on the north side of the choir and nave, where, in\r\nconsequence of the soil having accumulated several feet in height, that\r\npart of the building has escaped being pared down. What has been the\r\nresult is shown there in the nook shafts of the arcade, which have been\r\nreduced from a due proportion to one most inadequate.\r\n\r\n[11] It is possible that Basire, whose words are rather curious, simply\r\nmeans that he destroyed the chapels. He speaks of them as \"being blown\r\nup by Sir Arthur Haslerig in the Gunpowder Plot of the late Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\n[12] Some years before 1834, when Mackenzie wrote, a portion of it had\r\nbeen \"converted into a respectable and substantial house,\" and was then\r\nthe residence of Mr. Henry Morton, Lord Durham’s agent. In or about\r\n1875 the house underwent further changes, and has now for many years\r\nbeen known as Lambton Grange. There is, however, another building in\r\nthe Park, locally known as the old Hall, and at one time used as a\r\nbrewery, which may represent some intermediate residence.\r\n\r\n[13] The above account of Lambton Castle is abridged from an address\r\ngiven by the late Henry Leighton of Lambton Grange, when acting as\r\nchairman at the dinner given to the workmen on the completion of the\r\nrestoration of Lambton Castle, January 18, 1868.\r\n\r\n[14] A somewhat similar building is at Bale Hill, near Wolsingham.\r\n\r\n[15] A considerable portion of the Tower fell in February, 1890,\r\nleaving portions of the west and south walls still standing.\r\n\r\n[16] So Surtees sayeth. _A falcon on a tun_ was the family crest.\r\n\r\n[17] The tablet in the church which Surtees noted to the memory of\r\nWilliam James has disappeared. There is a large marble tablet on the\r\nnorth wall to the memory of James Brack and his three wives, which\r\nreads rather curiously owing to the major portion of the inscriptions\r\nhaving been raised and the panel containing his name inserted last. At\r\nthe foot the family arms have been emblazoned, a scarlet shield, having\r\napparently a passant lion of the same colour on a silver chief, and\r\nimpaling the sable shield with the engrailed fess and silver hands of\r\nthe Bates. The colours are badly rubbed and will not survive many more\r\ncleanings.\r\n\r\n[18] The late Mr. Boyle described the house as \"ugly,\" an opinion we\r\ncannot agree with. If not beautiful, it is certainly a handsome old\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[19] The writer of this chapter would be very grateful if any reader\r\nwho should chance to know where the other letters are would communicate\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n[20] See _Dictionary of National Biography_, for Canon Dale, vol.\r\nxiii.; for Thomas Pelham Dale, _ibid._, supplement, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[21] The descendants of George Dale, the elder brother of Ralph Dale,\r\nthis Edward Dale’s great grandfather, were apparently extinct in\r\nthe male line by 1750, although George Dale, by his marriage with\r\nElizabeth, daughter of John Lively, Vicar of Kelloe, 1625-56, had at\r\nleast three sons alive in March, 1655-56--namely, Edward, John, and\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n[22] See the paper on John Lawrence in vol. iv. of the Proceedings of\r\nthe Sunderland Antiquarian Society.\r\n\r\n[23] The letter has appeared in a privately printed magazine, the\r\n_Family News_. See British Museum catalogue, under \"Periodicals:\r\nNorthwood.\"\r\n\r\n[24] See _A Christian Sketch of Lady Maxwell_, by Robert Bourne.\r\nLondon, 1819.\r\n\r\n[25] When he was in America, he had proposed to and been rejected\r\nby a Miss Hopkey in 1757, and in 1748 he had been engaged to a Miss\r\nMurray, so that his opinion of the advantage of celibacy had known some\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n[26] See _Dictionary of National Biography_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[27] Their early pedigree has been printed in detail by the Rev.\r\nWilliam Greenwell in the seventh volume of the _New History of\r\nNorthumberland_. Their later descents have been fully dealt with, so\r\nfar as Raby and this county are concerned, by Surtees. It therefore\r\nseems needless, in a limited volume like this, to retrace their\r\nfortunes already so well traced. See also an interesting account of the\r\nfamily by another local writer in _The House of Neville in Sunshine and\r\nShade_.\r\n\r\n[28] For an interesting note upon the Eures, rather apt to be\r\noverlooked, see the _Archæological Journal_, 1860, p. 218. The family\r\nmotto was _Vince malum bono_.\r\n\r\n[29] Readers interested in the Visitations should read Mr. George\r\nGrazebrooke’s very interesting introduction to the Harleian Society’s\r\n_Visitation of Shropshire_, 1623 (vol. xxviii.). Commenting upon a\r\nsimilar state of affairs in that county, he says: \"Such names shew that\r\nalthough it is very pleasant to a family to find their descents duly\r\nrecorded, still the absence of their name altogether from the list is\r\nno proof whatever that their social position and heraldic rights were\r\nnot all the time perfectly well assured.\"\r\n\r\n[30] The origin of the Greenwells may be compared with an interesting\r\npaper upon \"Clerical Celibacy in the Diocese of Carlisle,\" by the Rev.\r\nJames Wilson, in _Northern Notes and Queries_, 1906, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[31] Another descent of the Blacketts from the Conyers has been pointed\r\nout by the late Mr. Cadwallader Bates. _Cf._ his Letters, p. 124.\r\n\r\n[32] The Pemberton descent given in Burke’s _Landed Gentry_ needs\r\ncorrection. _Cf._ Foster’s _Visitations of Durham_, p. 251, footnote 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nThe Church from the North-west, Finchale Priory 136=> The Church from\r\nthe North-west, Finchale Priory 139 {pg xii}\r\n\r\nfrequently occuring Celtic=> frequently occurring Celtic {pg 87}\r\n\r\nthe orginal chancel=> the original chancel {pg 173}",
