It is, I venture to say, the\r\nmost complete collection of portraits of the explorers that has yet been\r\npublished in one volume. Some of them of course must needs be\r\nconventional; but many of them, such as the portrait of Oxley when a\r\nyoung man, and of A.C. Gregory, have never been given publicity before;\r\nand in many cases I have selected early portraits, whenever I had the\r\nopportunity, in preference to the oft published portrait of the same\r\nsubject when advanced in years.\r\n\r\nThere are many who assisted me in the collection of these portraits. To\r\nMr. F. Bladen, of the Public Library, Sydney; Mr. Malcolm Fraser, of\r\nPerth, Western Australia; Mr. Thomas Gill, of Adelaide; Sir John Forrest;\r\nThe Reverend J. Milne Curran; Mr. Archibald Meston; and many others my\r\nbest thanks are due. In fact, in such a work as this, one cannot hope for\r\nsuccess unless he seek the assistance of those who remembered the\r\nexplorers in life, or have heard their friends and relatives talk\r\nfamiliarly of them. Let me particularly hope that from these pages our\r\nyouth, who should be interested in the exploration of their native land,\r\nwill form an adequate idea of the character of the men who helped to make\r\nAustralia, and of some of the adverse conditions against which they\r\nstruggled so nobly.\r\n\r\nERNEST FAVENC.\r\n\r\nSydney, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe published Journals of all the Explorers of Australia.\r\nReports of Explorations published in Parliamentary Papers.\r\nHistory of New South Wales, from the Records.

Hitherto we\r\nhave been too close to them rightly to appreciate what was done. This\r\nbook therefore comes at an opportune time, and is a valuable record. The\r\nauthor has already done a great service to Australian explorations by his\r\nwritings, and in the present instance has added to our obligation to him\r\nby condensing the records into a smaller compass, and by that means has\r\nbrought it within convenient limits for use in schools and for general\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nOf the explorers of Australia, eleven have been honoured by being placed\r\non the Golden Roll (Gold Medallists) of the Royal Geographical Society of\r\nLondon; Edward John Eyre being the first to receive the honour in 1843,\r\nand Ernest Giles being the eleventh and last to receive it in 1880. In\r\nthe order of Nature one generation passeth away and another generation\r\ncometh, and so it comes to pass that every one on the Golden Roll except\r\nmyself has gone to the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nThat the Australian people will always remember the deeds of those, who,\r\nin their day and generation, under arduous and difficult conditions\r\ndevoted themselves to the exploration of the Continent goes without\r\nsaying, and I, who in bygone years had the honour of assisting in the\r\ntask, heartily wish that such fruit may be born of those deeds that\r\nAustralia will continue to increase and flourish more and more\r\nabundantly, and thus fulfil her destiny as the great civilising and\r\ndominating power in the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORREST.\r\n\r\nThe Bungalow,\r\nHay Street, Perth,\r\nWestern Australia,\r\nJanuary 7th, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION, by Sir John Forrest.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 1.

ORIGINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1. GOVERNOR PHILLIP.\r\n\r\nArthur Phillip, whose claim to be considered the first inland explorer of\r\nthe south-eastern portion of Australia rests upon his discovery of the\r\nHawkesbury River and a few short excursions to the northward of Port\r\nJackson, had but scant leisure to spare from his official duties for\r\nextended geographical research. For all that, Phillip and a few of his\r\nofficers were sufficiently imbued with the spirit of discovery to find\r\nopportunity to investigate a considerable area of country in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the settlement, and, considering the fact that\r\nall their explorations at the time had to be laboriously conducted on\r\nfoot, they did their work well.\r\n\r\nThe first excursion undertaken by Phillip was on the 2nd of March, 1788,\r\nwhen he went to Broken Bay, whence, after a slight examination, he was\r\nforced to return by the inclemency of the weather. On the 15th of April\r\nhe made another attempt to ascertain the character and features of the\r\nunknown land that he had taken possession of. Landing on the shore of the\r\nharbour, a short distance from the North Head, he started on a tour of\r\nexamination, and, in the course of his march, penetrated to a distance of\r\nfifteen miles from the coast. At this point he caught sight of the\r\ndistant range that was destined to baffle for many years the western\r\nprogress of the early settlers. Phillip, on this his first glimpse of it,\r\nchristened the northern elevations the Caermarthen Hills, and the\r\nsouthern elevations the Lansdowne; and a remarkable hill, destined to\r\nbecome a well-known early landmark, he called Richmond Hill. In the brief\r\nview he had of this range, there was suddenly born in Phillip's mind the\r\nconviction that a large river must have its source therein, and that upon\r\nthe banks of such a river, the soil would be found more arable than about\r\nthe present settlement. He at once made up his mind to try and gain the\r\nrange on a different course.\r\n\r\nA week later he landed at the head of the harbour and directed his march\r\nstraight inland, hoping to reach either the mountains, which he knew to\r\nbe there, or the river in whose existence he firmly believed.\r\nDisappointment dogged his steps; on the first day a belt of dense scrub\r\nforced his party to return and when, on the morrow, they avoided the\r\nscrub by following up a small creek and got into more thinly timbered\r\ncountry, their slow progress enabled them to accomplish only thirty miles\r\nin five days. By that time, they were short of provisions; there was no\r\nriver visible, and the range still looked on them from afar. What cheered\r\nthem was the sight of some land that promised richly to reward the labour\r\nof cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 6th of June, 1789, that Phillip resumed his labours\r\nin the field of exploration. The Sirius had then returned from the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and he could reckon on the assistance of his friend,\r\nCaptain Hunter, to re-investigate Broken Bay with the vessel's boats.\r\nAccordingly, two boats were sent on to Broken Bay with provisions, where\r\nthey were joined by the Governor and his party, who had marched overland.\r\nBesides Phillip, the party consisted of Captain Hunter and two of his\r\nofficers, Captain Collins, Captain Johnston, and Surgeon White.\r\n\r\nFor two days they were engaged in examining the many inlets and openings\r\nof the Bay, and on the third, they chanced upon a branch that had before\r\nescaped their notice. They proceeded to explore it, and found the river\r\nof which Phillip had dreamed. The next day, renewed examination proved\r\nthat it was indeed a noble river, with steep banks and a depth of water\r\nthat promised well for navigation.\r\n\r\nAfter their return to Sydney Cove, preparations were at once made to\r\nfollow up this important discovery. On the 28th of June, Phillip, again\r\naccompanied by Hunter, left the Cove, having made much the same\r\narrangements as before. There was a slight misunderstanding with regard\r\nto meeting the boat; but, after this was cleared away, the party soon\r\nfloated out on to the waters of the new-found river. They rowed up the\r\nriver until they reached the hill that Phillip, at a distance, had\r\nchristened Richmond Hill. On traversing a reach of the stream, the main\r\nrange, that as yet they had only dimly seen in the distance, suddenly\r\nloomed ahead of them, frowning in rugged grandeur close upon them, as it\r\nseemed. Struck with admiration and astonishment at this unexpected\r\nrevelation of the deep ravines and stern and gloomy gorges that scored\r\nits front, over which hung a blue haze, Phillip, almost involuntarily,\r\nnamed them on the moment; the Blue Mountains. Next morning the explorers\r\nascended Richmond Hill, from whose crest they looked across a deep,\r\nwooded valley to the mountains still many miles away. After a hasty\r\nexamination of the country on the banks of the river, Phillip and his\r\nband returned to the settlement, he having now realised his brightest\r\nhopes and anticipations.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of April, 1791, Phillip again started on an expedition, the\r\nobject of which was a closer inspection of the Blue Mountains. He was\r\naccompanied this time by Captain Tench and Lieutenant Dawes; the latter,\r\nin December, 1789, had been sent out with a small party to reach the foot\r\nof the range, but had succeeded in approaching only within eleven miles\r\nof the Mountains, whence he was forced to retire by the rugged and broken\r\nnature of the country. On the present occasion, they reached the river\r\ntwo days after leaving Rose Hill. They followed it for another two days,\r\nbut made no further discoveries, being greatly delayed by the constant\r\ndetours around the heads of small tributary creeks, too deep to cross in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the river.\r\n\r\nThis was the last exploring expedition undertaken by Governor Phillip.\r\nConsidering that his health was not robust, and that the work entailed\r\nwas of a specially arduous nature, his personal share in exploring the\r\ncountry about the little settlement was noteworthy. It proved him to\r\npossess both the foresight and the energy necessary in an explorer.\r\n\r\n1.2. CAPTAIN TENCH.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1789, Captain Watkin Tench, who, during his short\r\nsojourn in the infant colony showed himself as zealous in exploration as\r\nhe was keen in his observations, started from the newly-formed redoubt at\r\nRose Hill, of which he was in command, on a short excursion to examine\r\nthe surrounding country. This trip, inspired by Tench's ardent love of\r\ndiscovery, became a noteworthy one in the annals of New South Wales. It\r\nwas made during the month that witnessed the discovery of the Hawkesbury\r\nRiver. On the second day after his party left Rose Hill, they found\r\nthemselves early in the morning on \"the banks of a river, nearly as broad\r\nas the Thames at Putney, and apparently of great depth, the current\r\nrunning very slowly in a northerly direction.\"\r\n\r\nThis river, at first known as the Tench, was afterwards named the Nepean\r\nby Phillip, when its identity as a tributary of the Hawkesbury had been\r\nconfirmed. Two other slight excursions were made by Tench in company with\r\nLieutenant Dawes, who was in charge of the Observatory, and ex-surgeon\r\nWorgan. In May, 1791, Tench and Dawes started from Rose Hill and\r\nconfirmed the supposition that the Nepean was an affluent of the\r\nHawkesbury, a matter over which there had been some doubt since its first\r\ndiscovery by Tench. Tench returned to England in H.M.S. Gorgon, in\r\nDecember, 1791.\r\n\r\nThe names of Paterson, Johnson, Palmer, and Laing are also connected with\r\nexploration on the upper Hawkesbury.\r\n\r\n1.3. THE BLUE MOUNTAINS: BARALLIER.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of that portion of Australia which was accessible by the\r\nscanty means of the early settlers was for many years impeded by the\r\nstern barrier of the mountains, and most of their efforts in the\r\ndirection of discovery were aimed at surmounting the range that defied\r\ntheir attacks. Among the many whose attempts were signalised only by\r\nfailure were the gallant Bass, whose name, for other reasons, will never\r\nbe forgotten by Australians, the quarrelsome and pragmatic Cayley, and\r\nthe adventurous Hack. Amongst them there was one, however, whose failure,\r\nread by the light of modern knowledge, was probably a geographical\r\nsuccess. This was Francis Barallier, ensign in the New South Wales corps,\r\nwho was encouraged by Governor King to indulge his ardent longing for\r\ndiscovery. By birth a Frenchman, Barallier had received his ensigncy by\r\ncommission on the 13th of February, 1801, having done duty as an ensign\r\nsince July, 1800, by virtue of a government general order issued by\r\nGovernor Hunter. In August, 1801, he had been appointed by Governor King\r\nmilitary engineer, in place of Captain Abbott resigned. In February,\r\n1802, he was succeeded by Lieutenant George Bellasis, an artillery\r\nofficer. Besides his expeditions to the Blue Mountains, he did much\r\nsurveying with Lieutenant James Grant in the Lady Nelson. In 1804, he\r\nwent to England and saw service in several regiments, distinguishing\r\nhimself greatly in military engineering, amongst his works being the\r\nerection of the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square, the designer of which\r\nwas Mr. Railton. Barallier died in 1853.\r\n\r\nPeron, the French naturalist, tells us that when in Sydney in October,\r\n1802, he persuaded Governor King to fit out a party to attempt the\r\npassage of the mountains, and that a young Frenchman, aide-de-camp to the\r\nGovernor, was intrusted with the leadership. He returned, however,\r\nwithout having been able to penetrate further than his English\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nOn the following month, however, Barallier set out from Parramatta, on\r\nhis famous embassy to the King of the Mountains. This fictitious embassy\r\narose from the fact that Colonel Paterson having refused Barallier the\r\nrequired leave, King claimed him as his aide-de-camp, and sent him on\r\nthis embassy. Barallier started with four soldiers, five convicts, and a\r\nwaggon-load of provisions drawn by two bullocks. He crossed the Nepean\r\nand established a depot at a place known as Nattai, whence the waggon was\r\nsent back to Sydney for provisions, Barallier, with the remainder of his\r\nmen and a native, pushing out westwards. After this preliminary\r\nexamination he returned to the depot, and made a fresh departure on the\r\n22nd of November, and, continuing mostly directly westwards, he reached a\r\npoint (according to his chart) about one hundred and five miles due west\r\nfrom Lake Illawarra. If this position is even approximately correct, he\r\nmust have been at the very source of the Lachlan River.\r\n\r\nI give a few extracts from his diary, which was not even translated until\r\nthe Historical Records of New South Wales were collected by Mr. F.M.\r\nBladen. They refer to the crossing of the range.\r\n\r\n\"On the 24th of November, I followed the range of elevated mountains,\r\nwhere I saw several kangaroos. This country is covered with meadows and\r\nsmall hills, where trees grow a great distance apart...I resumed my\r\njourney, following various directions to avoid obstacles, and at 4\r\no'clock I arrived on the top of a hill where I discovered that the\r\ndirection of the chain of mountains extended itself north-westerly to a\r\ndistance which I estimated to be about thirty miles, and which turned\r\nabruptly at right angles. It formed a barrier nearly north and south,\r\nwhich it was necessary to climb over...At 7 o'clock I arrived on the\r\nsummit of another hill, from where I noticed three openings: the first on\r\nthe right towards North 50 West; the other in front of me, and which\r\nappeared very large, was west from me; and the third was South 35 West.\r\n\r\n...This discovery gave me great hope, and the whole of the party appeared\r\nquite pleased, thinking that we had surmounted all difficulties, and that\r\nwe were going to enter a plain, the apparent immensity of which gave\r\nevery promise of our being able to penetrate far into the interior of the\r\ncountry...At six o'clock I found myself at a distance of about two miles\r\nfrom the western passage...I was then only half-a-mile from the passage,\r\nand I sent on two men in order to discover it, instructing them to ascend\r\nthe mountain to the north of this passage...I waited till 7 o'clock for\r\nmy two men, who related to me, that after passing the range which was in\r\nfront of us we would enter an immense plain, that from the height where\r\nthey were on the mountain, they had caught sight of only a few hills\r\nstanding here and there on this plain, and that the country in front of\r\nthem had the appearance of a meadow...At daybreak I left with two men to\r\nverify myself the configuration of the ground, and to ascertain whether\r\nthe passage of the Blue Mountains had really been effected. I climbed the\r\nchain of mountains north of us. When I had reached the middle of this\r\nheight the view of a plain as vast as the eye could reach confirmed to me\r\nthe report of the previous day...I discovered towards the west and at a\r\ndistance which I estimated to be forty miles, a range of mountains higher\r\nthan those we had passed...From where I was, I could not detect any\r\nobstacle to the passage right to the foot of those mountains...After\r\nhaving cut a cross of St. Andrew on a tree to indicate the terminus of my\r\nsecond journey, I returned by the same route I had come.\"\r\n\r\nBarallier concludes his diary by mentioning another projected expedition\r\nover the mountains from Jervis Bay. But no record of such a journey has\r\never come to light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Statue of Gregory Blaxland, Lands Office, Sydney.]\r\n\r\n[Map.

THE BLUE MOUNTAINS: BLAXLAND.\r\n\r\nWhether Barallier succeeded or not in reaching the summit of the\r\nmountains, the verdict accepted at that date was that they had not been\r\npassed; and until the year 1813, they were regarded as impenetrable. The\r\nnarrative of the crossing of these mountains, and the chain of events\r\nthat led up to the successful attempt is widely known, but only in a\r\ngeneral way. It is for this reason that a longer and more detailed\r\naccount is given in these pages; and as the expedition was successful in\r\nopening up a way to the interior of the Continent, it is fitting that its\r\nleader and originator, Gregory Blaxland, should be classed amongst the\r\nmakers of Australasia.\r\n\r\nBlaxland was born in Kent, in 1771, and arrived in the colony in 1806,\r\naccompanied by his wife and three children. He settled down to the\r\ncongenial occupation of stockbreeding, on what was then considered to be\r\na large scale. Finding that his stock did not thrive so well in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the sea coast, and wanting more land for\r\npasturing his increasing herds, he made anxious enquiries in all\r\ndirections as to the possibility of crossing the Blue Mountains inland.\r\nNobody would entertain such a suggestion, the failures had been too many:\r\nevery one to whom he broached the subject declared it to be impossible,\r\nprophesying that the extension of the settlement westward would forever\r\nbe obstructed by their unscalable heights. Blaxland, however, was not\r\nintimidated by these disheartening predictions; and, in 1811, he started\r\nout on a short journey of investigation, in company with three Europeans\r\nand two natives. On this trip he found that by keeping on the crowning\r\nridge or dividing water-shed between the streams running into the Nepean\r\nand those that fed what he then took to be an inland river, he got along\r\nfairly well. Some time afterwards he accompanied the Governor in a boat\r\nexcursion up the Warragamba, a tributary of the Nepean, and though there\r\nwere no noteworthy results, it convinced Blaxland that, could he follow\r\nhis former tactics of adhering to the leading ridge that formed the\r\ndivide between the tributaries of the northern bank of this river and the\r\naffluents of the Grose, a tributary of the Hawkesbury, he would attain\r\nhis object and reach the highlands. It will thus be seen that Blaxland\r\nacted with a definite and well-thought-out mode of procedure; and that\r\nthe ridge he selected for the attempt was chosen with judgment based on\r\nconsiderable knowledge of the locality, which he gained from many talks\r\nwith the men who hunted and frequented the foothills of the range.\r\nFinally, when he had arranged his plan of assault, he confided his\r\nintention to two friends, Lieutenant William Lawson and William Charles\r\nWentworth, whose names are associated with his in the conquest of the\r\nMountains. They both consented to accompany him, and agreed to follow his\r\nidea of stubbornly following one leading spur. Blaxland's former\r\nexpedition had convinced him that the local knowledge of the natives did\r\nnot extend far enough to be of any service, and they therefore did not\r\ntake any aborigines with them. They took pack-horses, however, which\r\nproves that the party started with a well-founded faith in their ultimate\r\nsuccess, and gave no heed to the terrifying descriptions of former\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nThe besetting hindrance to their progress was the low scrub of brushwood\r\nthat greatly delayed the pack-horses. This obstacle was overcome only by\r\npatiently advancing before the horses every afternoon, and cutting a\r\nbridle-track for the succeeding day's stage. Thus literally, the way that\r\nultimately led into the interior was won by foot, and the little\r\npioneering band eventually descended into open grazing country at the\r\nhead of what is now known as the Cox River. The outward and return trip\r\noccupied less than one month's time; which speaks volumes for the wise\r\nchoice of route; but what says more, is the fact that no better natural,\r\nupward pathway has since been found.\r\n\r\nA synopsis of Blaxland's journal is given here, commencing with a few\r\nquoted lines of preamble:--\r\n\r\n\"On Tuesday, May 11th, 1813, Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William Wentworth\r\nand Lieutenant Lawson, attended by four servants, with five dogs and four\r\nhorses laden with provisions and other necessaries, left Mr. Blaxland's\r\nfarm at South Creek for the purpose of endeavouring to affect a passage\r\nover the Blue Mountains, between the Western River* and the River\r\nGrose...The distance travelled on this and subsequent days was computed\r\nby time, the rate being estimated at about two miles per hour.\"\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] The Warragamba.\r\n\r\nThey camped at the foot of the ridge that was to witness the last\r\nstruggle between man and the Mountains. On the first day, they did three\r\nmiles and a half in a direction varying from south-west to\r\nwest-north-west, and that night obtained a little grass for the horses,\r\nand some water in a rocky hole.\r\n\r\nThe heavy dews in the morning retarded any attempts at early departures,\r\nas the thick wet brush rendered it difficult to drive the horses, so\r\nthat, as a rule, it was nine o'clock before they were able to strike\r\ncamp. The ridge, still favouring the direction of west and north-west, on\r\nthe third day they arrived at a tract of land, hilly, but with tolerable\r\ngrass on it. Here they found traces of a former white visitant in the\r\nshape of a marked-tree line. Two miles from this point, they met with a\r\nbelt of brushwood so dense that for the first time they were forced to\r\nalter their course; but the subordinate spurs on either side ending in\r\nrocky precipices, they had to return and again confront the scrub. In\r\nthese circumstances, they made up their minds to rely upon axe and\r\ntomahawk to win a way, and so next morning fell to work cutting a passage\r\nfor the horses. The ascent was also now becoming steep and rough, and on\r\nthis day some of the horses fell while struggling up with their loads.\r\n\r\nThe first day's work gained for them five miles, but at the end of their\r\ntoil they had to retrace their weary way back to the last night's camp.\r\nThe next day they cleared the track for only two miles further ahead; so\r\nmuch time being wasted in walking backwards and forwards to the work.\r\nThere was no grass amongst the scrub that encompassed them, and when, on\r\nMonday, they determined to move the camp equipage forward, they packed\r\nthe horses with as much cut-grass as they could put on them. This\r\namounted to, according to Lawson's diary, about two hundred pounds weight\r\nfor each horse, which, in addition to their ordinary loads, must have\r\nbeen a very weighty packload for uphill work. However, according to\r\nBlaxland, \"they stood it well.\" They obtained no water for their animals\r\nthat night, and what they wanted for their own requirements had to be\r\npainfully carried up a cliff about six hundred feet in height. On the\r\nsucceeding day they suddenly came on what at first appeared to be an\r\nimpassable barrier. The ridge which they had so pertinaciously followed,\r\nhad, for the last mile narrowed and dwindled down into a sharp\r\nrazor-backed spur, flanked with rugged and abrupt gullies on either\r\nslope. Across this narrow way now stretched a perpendicularly-sided mass\r\nof rock, which seemed effectually to bar their path. The removal of a few\r\nlarge boulders however, revealed an aperture which, after some labour,\r\nthey widened sufficiently to allow the pack-horses to squeeze through.\r\n\r\nOnce through they began to ascend what they estimated to be the second\r\ntier of the Mountains. Shortly after they left camp that morning they\r\ncame on a pile of stones, or cairn, evidently the work of some European,\r\nwhich they attributed to Bass. They were much elated at the thought that\r\nthey had now passed beyond the limit of any previous attempt.*\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] This cairn was afterwards named Cayley's Repulse by Governor\r\nMacquarie: but recent research goes to show that Cayley followed the\r\nvalley of the Grose, and was many miles to the north of where the cairn\r\nwas found. According to Flinders, Bass was not on the high ridge\r\ntraversed by Blaxland and party.\r\n\r\nThey could now look round with triumph on the panorama spread beneath\r\ntheir view, and from the superior elevation which they had obtained, they\r\ntook the bearings of several noticeable landmarks that they had seen\r\nbefore only from the flat country. The labour of cutting a path each day\r\nfor the horses for the next day's march had, however, still to be\r\ncontinued; but the crest of the ridge was again wider, though the gullies\r\non each side were as steep as before. That night, in camp, the dogs were\r\nuneasy throughout the night, and several times gave tongue and aroused\r\nthe sleepers, tired with their day's work. From what they found\r\nafterwards, they had good reason to believe that the blacks had been\r\nlurking around meditating an attack.\r\n\r\nThey then passed over the locality known in the present day as\r\nBlackheath, and soon afterwards had their course diverted to the\r\nnorthward by what Blaxland terms \"a stone wall rising perpendicularly out\r\nof the side of the mountain.\" This they tried to descend, but without\r\nsuccess, and so kept on along its brow. Undergrowth still delayed them,\r\nand they still had to spend their energies in hewing a passage, until on\r\nthe 28th of the month, they camped on the edge of the steep descent that\r\nhad lately marched beside them. The decline was, however, not quite so\r\nabrupt, and the face no longer composed of solid rock. They paused to\r\noverlook what lay before them and immediately below, and found the view\r\nmore gratifying than they had anticipated. What they had at first taken\r\nfor sandy barren soil proved now, on nearer inspection, to be forest-land\r\nfairly covered with a good growth of grass. The horses not having tasted\r\nfresh grass for some days, they cut a slanting trench across the sloping\r\nface of the descent in order to afford the horses some sort of foot-hold,\r\nand managed to get them down to a little feed that evening.\r\n\r\nNext morning they were up and away early, and reached the foot of the\r\nmountain (Mount York) at 9 a.m., having had to carry the pack-loads down\r\nmost of the way themselves, as it was too steep for laden horses to\r\npreserve their balance with safety. The actual base of the mountain was\r\nreached through a gap in the rocks, some thirty feet in width.\r\n\r\nThey now found themselves on what was then termed meadow land, drained by\r\nthe upper tributaries of the Warragamba; and this country presenting no\r\nserious obstacle to their further progress, they rightly concluded that\r\nthey had now surmounted every difficulty. They followed the mountain\r\nstream up for some distance and, at the furthest point they reached,\r\nascended a high sugar-loaf hill, which surveyor Evans, who followed in\r\ntheir footsteps, called Mount Blaxland. From the summit they had an\r\nextensive view all around, and Blaxland described the character of the\r\ncountry they saw in the following words: \"Forest and grass land,\r\nsufficient to support the stock of the colony for the next thirty years.\"\r\n\r\nJust here, let us compare this prophecy with a similar one made by Evans\r\na few months afterwards, on the pasture lands of the upper Macquarie:\r\n\"The increase of stock for some hundred years cannot overrun it.\"\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the explorers were now nearly expended; their apparel,\r\nespecially their footgear, was in rags and tatters; on the other hand,\r\nthe work that they had set themselves to do was well done. They had\r\nvanquished the Blue Mountains. Their return was uneventful. After\r\nbreakfast on the 6th of June, they crossed the Nepean, their provisions,\r\nwith the exception of a little flour, being quite consumed. We thus see\r\nhow in the end the impenetrable range, that had so long overawed the\r\ncolonists with its frown, was overcome, with slight difficulty, when\r\nlocal experience combined with method, was arrayed against it. To liken\r\nthe former expeditions to Blaxland's is to compare a few headlong\r\nassaults with a well-conceived and skilfully worked-out attack. The men\r\nthemselves write slightingly of the feat. Blaxland says: \"the passage of\r\nthe Blue Mountains might be easily effected.\" Lawson's opinion of the\r\nmountain is: \"that there would be no difficulty in making a good road\";\r\nand Wentworth's verdict is: \"that the country they reached is easy of\r\naccess.\" Evans, who was hot upon their trail, gives as his opinion: \"that\r\nthere are no hills on the ridge that their ascent or descent is in any\r\nway difficult.\"\r\n\r\nThe tidings brought back by the party of successful pioneers created the\r\ngreatest excitement in the little colony. No longer would the mountainous\r\nbarrier stand defiantly in their western path. For over thirty years it\r\nhad laughed at their puny efforts to cross its rugged crest, but its time\r\nhad come at last; the way to the unknown west was now open, and\r\nrejoicingly the settlers prepared to follow on the explorers' trail. What\r\nthe mysterious interior might hold, they could not imagine; but the gates\r\nthereto being thrown wide at last, its secrets would be soon known to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBlaxland died on the 3rd of January, 1853, having lived long enough to\r\nwitness the wonderful advance in settlement due to his energies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. GEORGE WILLIAM EVANS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. George W. Evans, Discoverer of the Macquarie and Lachlan\r\nRivers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1. FIRST INLAND EXPLORATION.\r\n\r\nGeorge William Evans, Deputy-Surveyor of Lands, came forward at this\r\nstage as the most prominent figure in Australian exploration. To him is\r\ndue the honour, without dispute or cavil, of being the first discoverer\r\nof an Australian river flowing into the interior. For some reason he has\r\nnever received adequate recognition of his important explorations, and he\r\nis well-nigh forgotten by the people of New South Wales, the state that\r\nhas benefited most by his labours. After Oxley's second expedition, his\r\nname appears to have been overshadowed by his official superior's. Yet\r\nhis work was invariably successful, and his labour in the field\r\nunremitting.\r\n\r\nEvans was born in England, at Warwick, in 1778. When a young man he went\r\nto the Cape of Good Hope, where he obtained an appointment in the\r\ndockyard, and while there he married his first wife, Janet Melvill. In\r\n1802 he was appointed Deputy Surveyor-General, and came to Australia in\r\nH.M.S. Buffalo, in order to take up his official duties. It was while he\r\nheld this post that he carried out his work of exploration.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned from these explorations, he resumed his duties as Deputy\r\nSurveyor-General only, until he was permanently settled in Tasmania,\r\nwhere he remained in office until the year 1825, when he resigned in\r\ndisgust at his treatment by his superiors.\r\n\r\nEvans lived at a time when official jealousies were rife, and men in\r\nposition often heedless of the justice or veracity of their statements\r\nwhen influenced by party rancour. The machinations of a cabal led by\r\nGovernor Arthur, and an effort made to deprive him of his well-deserved\r\npension, necessitated Evans's departure for England to defend his claims.\r\nIn this he was only partially successful, for the pension which it was\r\nunderstood was for life, was stopped in 1832. He returned to Tasmania,\r\nand passed the rest of his days at his residence, Warwick Lodge, at the\r\nhead of Newtown Bay. He died at the age of seventy-four, and is buried in\r\nthe old cemetery, Hobart; his second wife, Lucy Parris, rests in the same\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nEvans was a clever draughtsman, and some of his sketches of the country\r\nexplored are reproduced in Oxley's journal. He also published a book\r\nentitled History and Description of the Present State of Van Diemen's\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nIt was on Saturday, the 20th of November, 1813, that Evans, in charge of\r\nfive men, one of whom had been with Blaxland's party, started from the\r\npoint of forest land on the Nepean known as Emu Island. He lost no time\r\nin following the tracks of the late expedition, leaving the measurement\r\nuntil his return. On Friday, the 26th, he reached Blaxland's furthest\r\npoint, and thenceforward passed over new ground. It is somewhat amusing\r\nto note that his opinions of the country when on his outward way and on\r\nhis homeward, are widely divergent. He candidly and ingenuously writes,\r\nafter he has been on the table-land:--\r\n\r\n\"What appeared to me fine country on my first coming to it, looks\r\nmiserable now after returning from so superior and good a country.\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 30th of November, he gained a ridge that he had had in\r\nview for some time, though he had been \"bothered\" by the hills in his\r\nefforts to reach it. From this ridge he caught a tantalising view, a\r\nglimpse of the outskirts of the vast interior.\r\n\r\nThere before him, the first white man to look upon the scene, lay the\r\nopen way to two thousand miles of fair pasture-lands and brooding\r\ndesert-wastes -- of limitless plains and boundless rolling downs -- of\r\nopen grassy forests and barren scrubs -- of solitary mountain peaks and\r\nsluggish rivers; and, though then hidden from even the most brilliant\r\nimagination, the wondrous potentialities latent in that silent and\r\nuntrodden region. If a vision of the future had been vouchsafed\r\nDeputy-Surveyor Evans as he stood and gazed -- a vision of all that would\r\ncover the spacious lands before and beyond him before one hundred years\r\nhad passed away -- the entry he made in his diary would surely have\r\nreflected in its style his flight of imagination. Instead, we have the\r\nprosaic statement:--\r\n\r\n\"I came to a very high mount, when I was much pleased with the sight\r\nwestward. I think I can see 40 miles which had the look of open country.\"\r\n\r\nIn a pleasant valley, he came upon a large \"riverlett,\" and on its banks\r\nthey camped. There they shot ducks and caught \"trout\" -- as he called the\r\nMurray Cod -- the first of the species to tickle the palate of a white\r\nman; fine specimens, too, weighing five and six pounds. As he proceeded\r\nfurther and further, he became enchanted with the scenery: \"The\r\nhandsomest I have yet seen, with gently-rising hills and dales\r\nwell-watered\" -- and he finally notes that language failed him to\r\ndescribe it adequately.\r\n\r\nEvans named the river that led him through this veritable land of promise\r\nthe Fish River, and a river which joined its waters with it from the\r\nsouth he called the Campbell River. The united stream he christened, as\r\nin duty bound, the Macquarie. Unimpeded in his course, he followed the\r\nMacquarie until he was 98 1/2 measured miles -- for they had been\r\nchaining since passing the limit of the first explorers -- from the\r\ntermination of Blaxland's journey. He then decided to return; for he had\r\ngained all the information he had been sent to seek; and though game was\r\nplentiful, his party were without shoes, and the horses were suffering\r\nfrom sore backs.\r\n\r\nThus was concluded in a most satisfactory manner the first journey of\r\nexploration into the interior. Evans constantly saw, during his progress,\r\nunmistakeable traces of the natives; but he interviewed only a small\r\nparty of five. This representative band of the inland aborigines of\r\nAustralia was composed of two lubras and some picaninnies, both the women\r\nbeing blind of the right eye.\r\n\r\nThe party reached the Nepean on their return journey on the 8th of\r\nJanuary, 1814. Mr. Cox was immediately intrusted with the superintendence\r\nof the work of making a public road over the range, following closely the\r\nsame route as that taken by Blaxland's party. This work was completed in\r\nthe year 1815, and on the 26th of April of the same year, Governor\r\nMacquarie and a large staff set out to visit the newly-found territory.\r\nThe Governor arrived at the recently-formed town of Bathurst on the 4th\r\nof May; but before his arrival Evans had been again ordered out on\r\nanother exploring expedition to the south-west.\r\n\r\n2.2. THE LACHLAN RIVER.\r\n\r\nEvans started from Bathurst on the 13th of May, 1815. He commenced his\r\njourney along the fine flat country then known as Queen Charlotte Vale,\r\nmaintaining a southerly course for a day or two; but finding himself\r\nstill amongst the tributaries of the Campbell River, he retraced his\r\nsteps some twelve or fourteen miles in order to avoid a row of rocky\r\nhills. He then struck out more to the westward. On Thursday, the 23rd, he\r\ncame to a chain of ponds bearing nearly north-west, and from a commanding\r\nridge saw before him a prospect as gratifying as some of the scenes\r\nviewed on his former trip.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw a more pleasing-looking country. I cannot express the\r\npleasure I feel in going forward. The hills we have passed are excellent\r\nland, well-wooded. To the south, distant objects are obscured by high\r\nhills, but in the south-west are very distant mountains, under them\r\nappears a mist as tho' rising from a river. It was the like look round to\r\nthe west, but beyond the loom of high hills are very faintly\r\ndistinguished.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first view Evans obtained of the Lachlan valley. The ponds\r\nhe had met with gradually grew into a connected stream: other ponds\r\nunited with them from the north-east, and he writes: \"they have at the\r\nend of the day almost the appearance of a river.\" On the 24th he came to\r\na creek which joined \"the bed of a river rising in a North 30 East\r\ndirection, now dry except in hollow places. It is fully 70 feet wide,\r\nhaving a pebbly bottom; on each side grow large swamp-oaks.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 1st of June, this river holding a definite course to the\r\nwestward, and he being clear of the points of the hills, which hitherto\r\nhad hindered him greatly, he determined to return, as he was running\r\nshort of provisions.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow I am necessitated to return, and shall ascend a very high hill\r\nI left on my right hand this morning. I leave no mark here more than\r\ncutting trees. On one situated in an angle of the river on a wet creek\r\nbearing north I have deeply carved EVANS, 1st JUNE, 1815.\"*\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] This tree, a tall and sturdy gum, flourished for over ninety\r\nyears, and when in its prime was, unfortunately, owing to the spread of\r\nagricultural settlement, inadvertently ring-barked and killed. It must\r\nhave been a fine tree when marked by the explorer, and though dead it is\r\nstill standing at the date of the publication of this book. In 1906, the\r\nshield of wood bearing the inscription, was cut off by Mr. James Marsh,\r\nof Marshdale, and is now preserved in the Australian Museum in Sydney,\r\nNew South Wales. It is the oldest marked-tree in the whole of\r\nAustralasia.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Evans ascended the hill he alluded to, and from the\r\nsummit enjoyed a most extended view of the surrounding country, which he\r\ncompared to a view of the ocean. On his way back to Bathurst, he bestowed\r\nupon the new river the name it now bears. A short passage in his diary,\r\nwritten during his return, is of peculiar interest, as it contains the\r\nfirst mention of snow seen in Australia by white men. On Thursday, the\r\n8th of June, he writes:--\r\n\r\n\"The mountains I observed bearing north-west are covered with snow; I\r\nthought on my way out that their tops looked rather white. To-day it was\r\ndistinguished as plain as ever I saw snow on the mountains in Van\r\nDiemen's Land. I never felt colder weather than it has been some days\r\npast. We have broken ice full two inches thick.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June the party returned to Bathurst, and Evans had by that\r\ntime accomplished two of the most momentous journeys ever made in\r\nAustralia. It was not his actual discoveries alone that brought him fame,\r\nbut the vast field for settlement these discoveries opened up. The\r\nindependent explorations of Surveyor Evans ceased after his discovery of\r\nthe Lachlan; thenceforward he served Australia as second to Lieutenant\r\nOxley.\r\n\r\n2.3. THE UNKNOWN WEST.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of that day took every advantage of the new outlets for\r\ntheir energies, thrown open to them by the recent successful\r\nexplorations. Cattle and sheep were rapidly driven forward on to the\r\nhighlands, and, favoured by a beautiful site, the town of Bathurst soon\r\nassumed an orderly appearance. Private enterprise had also been at work\r\nelsewhere. The pioneer settlers were making their way south; the tide of\r\nsettlement flowed over the intermediate lands to the Shoalhaven River;\r\nand in the north they had commenced the irresistible march of\r\ncivilization up the Hunter River.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Shoalhaven district that young Hamilton Hume, the first\r\nAustralian-born explorer to make his mark in the field, gained his\r\nbushcraft.\r\n\r\nGovernor Macquarie, during his term of office, did his best to foster\r\nexploration; and it was fortunate that the first advance into the\r\ninterior occurred when there was a Governor in Australia who did not look\r\ncoldly upon geographical enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe men who entered first upon the task of solving the geographical\r\nproblems of the interior of the Australian continent were doomed to meet\r\nwith much bitter disappointment. The varying nature of the seasons caused\r\nthe different travellers to form contrary and perplexing ideas, often\r\nwith regard to the same tract of country. What appeared to one man a land\r\nof pleasant gurgling brooks, flowing through rich pastures, appeared to\r\nanother as a pitiless desert, unfit for human foot to venture upon.\r\nOxley, who traversed what is now the cream of the agricultural portion of\r\nthe state of New South Wales, speaks of the main part of it in terms of\r\nthe bitterest condemnation. His error was of course rather a mistake in\r\njudgment than the result of inaccurate observation.\r\n\r\nSome of the colonists nursed far fonder hopes, and the general opinion\r\nseemed to be that these western flowing rivers would gather in\r\ntributaries, and having swollen to a size worthy of so great a continent,\r\nseek the sea on the west coast. W.C. Wentworth, who certainly was capable\r\nof forming an opinion deserving consideration, wrote thus of the then\r\nuntraced Macquarie River:--\r\n\r\n\"If the sanguine hopes to which the discovery of this river (the\r\nMacquarie) has given birth should be realised, and it should be found to\r\nempty itself into the ocean in the north-west coast, which is the only\r\npart of this vast island that has not been accurately surveyed, in what\r\nmighty conceptions of the future power and greatness of this colony may\r\nwe not reasonably indulge? The nearest point at which Mr. Oxley left off\r\nto any part of the western coast is very little short of two thousand\r\nmiles. If this river therefore be already of the size of the Hawkesbury\r\nat Windsor, which is not less than two hundred and fifty yards in\r\nbreadth, and of sufficient depth to float a seventy-four gun ship, it is\r\nnot difficult to imagine what must be its magnitude at its confluence\r\nwith the ocean, before it can arrive at which it has to traverse a\r\ncountry nearly two thousand miles in extent. If it possesses the usual\r\nsinuosities of rivers, its course to the sea cannot be less than from\r\nfive to six thousand miles, and the endless accession of tributary\r\nstreams which it must receive in its passage through so great an extent\r\nof country will, without doubt, enable it to vie in point of magnitude\r\nwith any river in the world.\"\r\n\r\nIt was to realise such ambitious hopes as these that Oxley went forth to\r\npenetrate into the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. JOHN OXLEY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. John Oxley. From a portrait in the possession of Mrs.\r\nOxley, of Bowral. The portrait was presented to Mrs. King, widow of\r\nGovernor King in 1810, and signed by him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1. GENERAL BIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nOxley was born in England in the early part of 1781. In his youth he\r\nentered the navy, saw active service in many parts of the world, and rose\r\nto the rank of Lieutenant. He came to Australia in January, 1812, and was\r\nappointed Surveyor-General.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career in Australia, Oxley would seem to have won the\r\nfriendship and respect of all he came in contact with. Captain Charles\r\nSturt, in the journal of his first expedition, wrote of him as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"A reflection arose to my mind, on examining these decaying vestiges of a\r\nformer expedition, whether I should be more fortunate than the leader of\r\nit, and how far I should be able to penetrate beyond the point which had\r\nconquered his perseverance. Only a week before I left Sydney I had\r\nfollowed Mr. Oxley to the tomb. A man of great quickness and of uncommon\r\nability. The task of following up his discoveries was no less enviable\r\nthan arduous.\"\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were suggested to Sturt when standing at one of Oxley's\r\nold camps, and coming from such a man carry great weight.\r\n\r\nThe following obituary notice of Oxley appeared in the Government Gazette\r\nof May 27th, 1828.\r\n\r\n\"It would be impossible for his Excellency, consistently with his\r\nfeelings, to announce the decease of the late Surveyor-General without\r\nendeavouring to express the sense he entertains of Mr. Oxley's services,\r\nthough he cannot do justice to them.\r\n\r\n\"From the nature of this colony, the office of Surveyor-General is\r\namongst the most important under Government; and to perform its duties in\r\na manner Mr. Oxley has done for a long series of years is as honourable\r\nto his zeal and abilities as it is painful for the Government to be\r\ndeprived of them.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Oxley entered the public service at an early period of his life, and\r\nhas filled the important situation of Surveyor-General for the last\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\n\"His exertions in the public service have been unwearied, as has been\r\nproved by his several expeditions to explore the interior. The public\r\nhave reaped the benefit while it is to be apprehended that the event,\r\nwhich they cannot fail to lament, has been accelerated by the privations\r\nand fatigues of these arduous services. Mr. Oxley eminently assisted in\r\nunfolding the advantages of this highly favoured colony from an early\r\nstage of its existence, and his name will ever be associated with the\r\ndawn of its advancement. It is always gratifying to the Government to\r\nrecord its approbation of the services of meritorious public officers,\r\nand in assigning to Mr. Oxley's name a distinguished place in that class\r\nto which his devotion to the interests of the colony has so justly\r\nentitled him, the Government would do honour to his memory in the same\r\ndegree as it feels the loss it has sustained in his death.\"\r\n\r\nOxley died at Kirkham, his private residence near Sydney, on the 25th of\r\nMay, 1828. Though his judgment was at times at fault, as will be seen\r\nlater on, he was essentially a successful explorer; for, although he did\r\nnot in every case achieve the object aimed at, he always brought back his\r\nmen without loss, and he opened up vast tracts of new country. John\r\nOxley's personality is not very familiar, but the portrait presented to\r\nthe reader in this volume was taken in the prime of his life, before he\r\nsuffered the scars of doubtful battle with the Australian wilderness. It\r\nhas never been published before, and is taken from the original miniature\r\nthat he presented to Mrs. King, widow of Governor King, in 1810.\r\n\r\n3.2. HIS FIRST EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nOn this, Oxley's first journey of exploration, Evans accompanied him as\r\nsecond in command, and another man who has left an immortal name was also\r\nwith him -- Allan Cunningham, officially known as King's Botanist.\r\nCharles Fraser, well-known in connection with the early history both of\r\nNew South Wales and of Western Australia, accompanied Oxley under the\r\ntitle of Colonial Botanist. There were nine other men in the party --\r\nboatmen, horse-tenders, and so forth; they had with them two boats and\r\nfourteen pack and riding-horses. A depot was first formed at the junction\r\nof the small creek whence Evans had turned back, and where he had marked\r\na tree with his initials in 1815. There the boats were launched and\r\npreparations completed for the final start. On the 6th of April, 1817,\r\nOxley left Sydney and joined his party at the depot on the 1st of May.\r\nThence he soon commenced this most momentous journey in Australia's early\r\nannals, eager to penetrate into the unknown, and inspired with hopes of\r\nsolving the mystery of the outlet of this inland river.\r\n\r\nDisappointment marks the tone of Oxley's journal from the start; the\r\nexceeding flatness of the country, the many ana-branches of the river,\r\nthe low altitude of its banks, and the absence of any large tributary\r\nstreams, above all, the dismal impression made by the monotony of the\r\nsurroundings, seem to have depressed Oxley's spirit. He appears to have\r\nformed the idea that the interior tract he was approaching was nothing\r\nmore than a dead and stagnant marsh -- a huge dreary swamp, within whose\r\nbounds the inland rivers lost their individuality and merged into a\r\nlifeless morass. A more melancholy picture could not be imagined, and\r\nwith such an awesome thought constantly haunting his mind there is no\r\nwonder that he became morbid, and that the dominant tone of his journal,\r\nwhilst on the Lachlan, is so hopelessly pessimistic.\r\n\r\n\"These flats,\" he says, \"are certainly not adapted for cattle; the grass\r\nis too swampy, and the bushes, swamps, and lagoons are too thickly\r\nintermingled with the better portion to render it a safe or desirable\r\ngrazing country. The timber is universally bad and small; a few misshapen\r\ngum trees on the immediate banks of the river may be considered an\r\nexception.\"\r\n\r\nThe channel of the river now divided, and Oxley followed the channel on\r\nthe northern side, which they were skirting. But before they had\r\nprogressed a mile beyond the point of divergence, they reached the spot\r\nwhere the river overflowed its banks and its course was lost in the\r\nmarshes. It was on the 12th of May that they received this check to their\r\nas yet uninterrupted progress.\r\n\r\n\"Observing an eminence about half-a-mile from the south side, we crossed\r\nover the horses and baggage at a place where the water was level with the\r\nbanks, and which, when within its usual channel, did not exceed thirty or\r\nforty feet in width.\r\n\r\n\"We ascended the hill, and had the mortification to perceive that the\r\ntermination of our research was reached, at least down this branch of the\r\nriver. The whole country from the west, north-west, round to the north,\r\nwas either a complete marsh or lay under water.\"\r\n\r\nThe country to the south and south-west appearing more elevated. Oxley\r\ndetermined to return to the place where the branches separated, and to\r\ntry his fortune on the other one. This, after a while, proved as\r\nunsatisfactory as the one they had abandoned. Bitterly disappointed,\r\nOxley altered his plans entirely. He resolved to cease trying to follow\r\nthe river through this water-logged country, and determined to strike out\r\non a direct course to the south coast in the neighbourhood of Cape\r\nNorthumberland. In this way he hoped to cross any river that these dreary\r\nmarshes and swamps gave birth to, and that found an outlet into the\r\nSouthern Ocean, between Spencer's Gulf and Cape Otway.\r\n\r\nThis resolve was at once carried out. The boats were hauled up and\r\nsecured together; all unnecessary articles were abandoned to suit the\r\nreduced means of transit; and at nine o'clock on May 18th they said\r\nfarewell to this weary river and started to encounter fresh troubles\r\nunder another guise. Instead of travelling in a superfluity of water they\r\nnow found themselves straitened by drought, and the work began to tell\r\nupon the horses. Scrub, too, that besetting hindrance of so many\r\nAustralian explorers, began to impede their onward path. Eucalyptus brush\r\noverrun with creepers and prickly acacia bushes united to bar the way,\r\nand when, after much toil and suffering, they at last reached the point\r\nof a range, which Oxley named the Peel Range, the leader had reluctantly\r\nagain to change his mind and to abandon the idea of making south-west to\r\nthe coast. Sick at heart of this sequence of disastrous happenings, he\r\nconfided his feeling of sorrow to his journal.\r\n\r\n\"June 4th. Weather as usual fine and clear, which is the greatest comfort\r\nwe enjoy in these deserts abandoned by every living creature capable of\r\ngetting out of them. I was obliged to send back to our former\r\nhalting-place for water, a distance of near eight miles; this is terrible\r\nfor the horses, who are in general extremely reduced; but two in\r\nparticular cannot, I think, endure this miserable existence much longer.\r\n\r\n\"At five o'clock two of the men whom I had sent to explore the country to\r\nthe south-west and see if any water could be found, returned after\r\nproceeding six or seven miles; they found it impossible to go any farther\r\nin that direction, or even south, from the thick bushes that intersected\r\ntheir course on every side; and no water (nor in fact the least sign of\r\nany) was discovered either by them or by those who were sent in search of\r\nit nearer our little camp.\r\n\r\n\"June 5th. From everything I can see of the country to the south-west, it\r\nappears, upon the most mature deliberation, highly imprudent to persevere\r\nlonger in that direction, as the consequences to the horses of want of\r\ngrass and water might be most serious; and we are well assured that\r\nwithin forty miles on that point the country is the same as before passed\r\nover...Our horses are unable to go more than eight or ten miles a day,\r\nbut even they must be assured of finding food of which in these deserts\r\nthe chances are against the existence.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, June 6th, Oxley, having changed his course to the\r\nwest and north-west, made another effort to escape from the surroundings\r\nthat so disheartened him. On the 4th of June, before leaving, Allan\r\nCunningham planted some acorns and peach and apricot stones in honour of\r\nthe King's birthday. Upon this episode Oxley remarks, that they would\r\nserve to commemorate the day and situation, \"should these desolate plains\r\nbe ever again visited by civilised man, of which, however, I think there\r\nis very little probability.\" All this only shows how the lack of\r\nexperience of the paradoxical nature of the Australian interior induced\r\nOxley to form an absurdly erroneous idea of the country in its virgin\r\nstate. His observations read almost like a present-day description of the\r\nsandy spinifex desert of the north-west of Western Australia, and, in\r\nfact, the very same remark was made by Warburton in 1873, when traversing\r\nthat awful desert. He confessed his uncertainty about the longitude of\r\nJoanna Spring, and says that it did not matter, as no white man would\r\never come into the desert again in search of the oasis.\r\n\r\nBut Oxley's troubles were increasing, and on June 8th he wrote: \"The\r\nwhole country in these directions, as far as the eye can reach, was one\r\ncontinued thicket of eucalyptus scrub. It was impossible to proceed that\r\nway, and our situation was too critical to admit of delay: it was\r\ntherefore resolved to return back to our last station on the 6th, under\r\nPeel's Range, if for no other purpose than that of giving the horses\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nForced to return once more, Oxley became thoroughly convinced of the\r\ninhabitability of the country, and it is no wonder that his condemnation\r\nwas so sweeping and hasty. He wrote on June the 21st:--\r\n\r\n\"The farther we proceed westerly, the more convinced I am that for all\r\nthe practical purposes of civilised man the interior of this country\r\nwestward of a certain meridian is uninhabitable, deprived as it is of\r\nwood, water and grass.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his fame, he then relinquished all thoughts and hopes\r\nof a southward course; for had he pushed on, posterity would have hailed\r\nhis memory as the discoverer of the Murrumbidgee. But Fate decided\r\notherwise, and dejected and baffled, he turned to follow the Peel Range\r\nnorth, making for the part he had left, where at least he was sure of a\r\nsupply of water. The expedition suddenly came upon the river again on the\r\n23rd of June, and hoping to find that it had modified its nature, they\r\ncommenced to run it down again. The 7th of July they were forced to halt\r\nonce more, when Oxley gave up all idea of tracing the Lachlan. He began\r\nhis return journey, making this last desponding entry:--\r\n\r\n\"It is with infinite regret and pain that I was forced to come to the\r\nconclusion that the interior of this vast country is a marsh and\r\nuninhabitable...There is a dreary uniformity in the barren desolateness\r\nof this country which wearies one more than I am able to express. One\r\ntree, one soil, one water, and one description of bird, fish, or animal\r\nprevails alike for ten miles and for one hundred. A variety of\r\nwretchedness is at all times preferable to one unvarying cause of pain or\r\ndistress.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration. The Lachlan River at the point where Oxley left it on the\r\n4th August, 1818, and struck North-East to gain the Macquarie River and\r\nfollow that river up to Bathurst. Photo by the Reverend J.M. Curran.]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August, the leader, knowing the repellant nature of the\r\nriver and its swamps and morasses that lay ahead of their returning\r\nfootsteps, determined to quit the Lachlan altogether, and steering a\r\nnorthern course, to abandon the low country, reach the Macquarie River\r\nand follow it up to the settlement at Bathurst.\r\n\r\nThe boats having been long since abandoned, it was necessary to build a\r\nraft of pine-logs wherewith to transport the baggage over the stream.\r\nThey crossed in safety, and we can imagine that it was with no feelings\r\nof regret that they finally lost sight of the stream that had so\r\npersistently baffled them in all their attempts to traverse its banks.\r\n\r\nFor some days they had to struggle against the many obstacles of a new\r\nand untrodden land, but they at last emerged on to the Macquarie country,\r\nwhich made a pleasant and welcome contrast with the detested Lachlan.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that too much stress has been laid upon Oxley's opinion\r\nof the Lachlan, but it was this pessimistic report that dominated the\r\npublic mind for many years in its speculations as to the character of the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nTo Oxley himself, the first glimpse of the Macquarie came like a ray of\r\nsunshine on his harassed feelings. Was he not to reap some reward for his\r\nheroic efforts along the Lachlan, to enjoy the realisation of some of his\r\nambition as geographical discoverer? The Macquarie seemed a favourable\r\nsubject for the exercise of his talents. Would it not lead him westward\r\nto the conquest of that mysterious inland country which had hitherto\r\nguarded its secrets with an invincible obstinacy? Poor Oxley, who can\r\nhelp rejoicing with him in his short-lived joy? Without knowing it, he\r\nwas the first of a long line of brave spirits who were doomed to lose\r\nhealth and life in carving their way into the heart of Australia.\r\n\r\nAs they returned homeward up the bank of the Macquarie, the river seemed\r\nto him to glitter with the bright promise of a crown of success. For\r\nalmost the first time the entry in his journal has a cheery ring of\r\nhope:--\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can afford a stronger contrast than the two rivers -- Lachlan\r\nand Macquarie -- different in their habits, their appearance, and the\r\nsource from which they derive their waters, but, above all, differing in\r\nthe country bordering on them; the one constantly receiving great\r\naccession of water from four streams, and as liberally rendering fertile\r\na great extent of country, whilst the other, from its source to its\r\ntermination is constantly diffusing and diminishing the water it\r\noriginally receives over low and barren deserts, creating only wet flats\r\nand uninhabitable morasses, and during its protracted and sinuous course\r\nis never indebted to a single tributary stream.\"\r\n\r\n3.3. THE LIVERPOOL PLAINS.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment occasioned by Oxley's return to Bathurst and his\r\nfailure to trace the course of the Lachlan was in part atoned for by the\r\nhigh opinion he had formed of the Macquarie. A second expedition was\r\nplanned, and the command again offered to the Surveyor-General.\r\n\r\nEvans was again second, and Dr. Harris, a very able man, accompanied the\r\nparty as a volunteer. Charles Fraser was botanist, but Allan Cunningham\r\ndid not go. The expedition was on a slightly larger scale, there being,\r\nbesides those already mentioned, twelve ordinary members, with eighteen\r\nhorses and provisions for twenty-four weeks. A depot was formed at\r\nWellington Valley, and men sent ahead to build two boats.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, the start was made from the depot, and for the first 125\r\nmiles no obstacles nor impediments were met with. Elated by this, Oxley\r\nsent two men back to Bathurst, in accordance with instructions, bearing a\r\nfavourable despatch to Governor Macquarie. But Fate was again deriding\r\nthe unfortunate explorer. No sooner had the two parties separated, one\r\nwith well-grounded hopes of their ultimate success, the other bearing\r\nback tidings of these confident hopes, than doubt and distrust entered\r\ninto the mind of the leader. Twenty-four hours after the departure of the\r\nmessengers, Oxley wrote in his journal:--\r\n\r\n\"For four or five miles there was no material change in the general\r\nappearance of the country from what it had been on the preceding days,\r\nbut for the last six miles the land was considerably lower, interspersed\r\nwith plains clear of timber and dry. On the banks it was still lower, and\r\nin many places it was evident that the river-floods swept over them,\r\nalthough this did not appear to be universally the case...These\r\nunfavourable appearances threw a damp upon our hopes, and we feared that\r\nour anticipations had been too sanguine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd still, as Oxley went on, he found the country getting flatter and\r\nmore liable to inundation, until at last, with a heart nearly as low as\r\nthe country, he found himself almost hemmed in by water. In fact, it was\r\nnecessary to retrace steps in order to find a place where they could\r\nencamp with safety. Upon this emergency, Oxley held a consultation with\r\nEvans and Harris, and it was decided to send the baggage and horses back\r\nto a small and safe elevation that stood some fifteen miles higher up the\r\nriver, thus making a subsidiary depot camp. Oxley himself, with four\r\nvolunteers in the largest of the two boats, would take a month's\r\nprovisions and follow the stream as long as there was enough water to\r\nfloat their craft. Meanwhile, Evans, during Oxley's absence, was to make\r\nan excursion to the north-east, and return by a more northerly route,\r\nthis being the direction the party intended to take, should the river\r\nfail them as the Lachlan had done on the previous journey.\r\n\r\nIt was a wet and stormy day on which Oxley started on the river voyage.\r\nFor about twenty miles there was, as Oxley expresses it, \"no country.\"\r\nThe main channels being in an overflow state, the flat country which\r\nsurrounded them could be recognised only by the timber growing on the\r\nbanks. The clear spaces whereon no trees grew were now covered with\r\nreeds, which stood at the height of six or seven feet above the surface.\r\nThat night they took refuge on a piece of land which was so nearly\r\nsubmerged that there was scarcely enough space on which to kindle a fire.\r\nIn the morning the violence of the storm had somewhat abated, and as soon\r\nas the grey light was strong enough for them to recognise their way, they\r\nresumed their dreary journey.\r\n\r\nOxley still contrived to keep to what he took to be the main channel,\r\nalthough, as it now pursued its course amid a dense thicket of reeds, it\r\nwas becoming more difficult with every succeeding mile. Oxley's\r\nseamanship, however, stood him in good stead, and although fallen logs\r\nnow began to obstruct their passage, they kept doggedly on for another\r\ntwenty miles. There was no diminution in the volume of the current that\r\nwas now bearing them onward, and Oxley felt confident that he was\r\napproaching that hidden lake, wherein the inland waters mingled their\r\nstreams, and of whose existence he thought he had now every reason to\r\nrest assured. Just as he was buoying his spirits up with these hopes,\r\ndreaming that in future he would be able proudly to say,\r\n\r\nWe were the first that ever burst\r\nInto that silent sea,\r\n\r\nthe river eluded all further pursuit by spreading out in every direction\r\namongst the ocean of reeds that surrounded them.\r\n\r\nWounded to the heart at this unlooked-for disappointment, Oxley, after\r\nvainly seeking for some clue or indication by which he could continue the\r\nsearch, had to 'bout ship and return to the camp of the night before. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"There was no channel whatever amongst these reeds, and the depth varied\r\nfrom five to three feet.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he was still convinced that the \"long sought-for Australian Sea\"\r\nexisted, he recognised the futility of continuing this search to the\r\nwestward, in which direction some malignant genius seemed ever to persist\r\nin thwarting him; and so he regained the shelter of the depot at Mount\r\nHarris, with another tale of frustrated hopes.\r\n\r\nEvans, on his return from his scouting expedition to the north and\r\nnorth-east, had a more cheerful story to tell. The weather had been wet\r\nthroughout, and the impassable nature of the country occasioned thereby\r\nhad hampered him greatly; nevertheless he had struggled across the worst\r\nof the flat country, and in the north-east had come to a new river, which\r\nhe named the Castlereagh. He was absent ten days, and on his return Oxley\r\ndetermined to abandon the Macquarie, which had proved even more deceptive\r\nand elusive than the Lachlan, and to strike out for the higher lands\r\nwhich Evans reported having seen.\r\n\r\nHe left Mount Harris on July 20th, first burying a bottle there\r\ncontaining a written scheme of his intended movements, and some silver\r\ncoin. Ten years afterwards, Captain Sturt made an ineffectual search for\r\nthis bottle. Oxley had also buried a bottle at the point of his departure\r\nfrom the Lachlan. Mitchell search for it without success, and learned\r\nafterwards that it had been broken by the blacks.\r\n\r\nOn July 27th, the party reached the bank of the Castlereagh, after\r\nfighting their way through bog, quagmire, and all the difficulties common\r\nto virgin country during continued wet weather. As the direction they\r\nwere steering was towards a range seen by Evans, and named Arbuthnot\r\nRange, their march was again interrupted by finding the new-found river\r\nthis time running bank-high, having evidently risen immediately after\r\nEvans had crossed it on his return journey. Here, perforce, they had to\r\nstay until the water subsided, and it was not until August 2nd that the\r\nriver had fallen enough to allow them to cross. The ground was still\r\nsoaked and boggy, and the horses having had to carry increased pack-loads\r\nsince the abandonment of the boats, the party suffered great toil and\r\nhardship in their efforts to gain Arbuthnot Range. The Range was reached,\r\nhowever, and rounding one end of it by skirting the base of a prominent\r\nhill which they named Mount Exmouth, the harassed explorers at last\r\nemerged upon splendid pastoral country.\r\n\r\nAs Oxley, from a commanding position, surveyed the magnificent scene\r\nspread out beneath him -- gentle hills separating smiling valleys, which\r\nin their turn merged into undulating plains all ripe for settlement -- he\r\nmust have felt that Fate had at length relented, and granted him a\r\nmeasure of reward as the discoverer of this beautiful land. He called the\r\nlocality Liverpool Plains, and the name has long been synonymous with\r\npastoral prosperity. Their journey to the eastward, which carried them\r\nthrough the heart of this rich and highly-favoured country, was now less\r\narduous; and though the ground was still wet from the late soaking rains,\r\nthe sun shone cheerily overhead, and the horses, revelling in the\r\nabundant rich grass and succulent herbage, began to recover their\r\nstrength. On September 2nd, they came to a river, which Oxley named the\r\nPeel; and here the expedition narrowly escaped the shadow of a fatality,\r\none man being nearly drowned whilst crossing. After leaving the Peel,\r\nOxley still continued easterly, traversing splendid open grazing country.\r\nHe was now approaching the dividing water-shed of the Main Range, to the\r\nnorthward of that portion of it which is known at the present day as the\r\nLiverpool Range. Here the deep glens and gullies with which the seaward\r\nfront is serrated, began to interfere seriously with the direct course of\r\ntravel, and at the heads of many of them there were cataracts and\r\nwaterfalls which compelled the wanderers to turn away to the south; and\r\non one occasion to revert almost to the west. One of these striking\r\nnatural features received the name of Becket's Cataract, and another was\r\nchristened Bathurst's Falls. Once again tempests and storms beset them,\r\nand this wild weather found them wandering amongst the steep ravines and\r\ndizzy descents of the mountainous range, seeking a way leading to the\r\nlowlands.\r\n\r\nIt was on September 23rd that Oxley and Evans, while searching for a\r\npracticable route, climbed a tall peak, and from the summit caught a\r\nglimpse of the sea. It seems to have greatly impressed Oxley, and he\r\nwrites in his journal of his emotions on the occasion:--\r\n\r\n\"Bilboa's ecstacy at the first sight of the South Sea could not have been\r\ngreater than ours when, on gaining the summit of this mountain, we beheld\r\nOld Ocean at our feet. It inspired us with new life; every difficulty\r\nvanished, and in imagination we were already home.\"\r\n\r\nThe descent was attended with many perils: Oxley says that at one period\r\nhe would willingly have compromised for the loss of one-third of the\r\nhorses to ensure the safety of the remainder. But the men with him were\r\ntried and steady, and the thick tufts of grass and the loose soil\r\nafforded them help in securing a surer footing, of every chance of\r\navailing themselves of which the men skilfully took advantage, so that\r\nboth men and horses reached the foot of the mountain -- now called Mount\r\nSeaview -- without mishap.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the head of a river running into the Pacific, and\r\nproceeded to follow its course down with more or less difficulty until\r\nthey reached the mouth, when Oxley, judging the entrance to be navigable,\r\nnamed it Port Macquarie, though one should imagine that he had become\r\ntired of that name. The river was named the Hastings.\r\n\r\nOn October 12th, a toilsome march commenced, following the shore to the\r\nsouthward. The wearisome interruptions of the many inlets and saltwater\r\ncreeks greatly fatigued and distressed his men. But at last they came\r\nupon a boat, half-buried in the sand, which had been lost some time\r\nbefore from a Hawkesbury coaster. This they cleaned and patched, and\r\ncarried with them, utilising it during the latter stages of this weary\r\njourney to facilitate the passage of the many saltwater creeks and\r\nchannels that impeded their progress. It is owing to the possession of\r\nthis derelict boat that Oxley crossed the mouth of the Manning without\r\nidentifying it as a river. The blacks now harassed them greatly, and it\r\nwas during one of the attacks made upon the party that one of the men,\r\nnamed William Black, was dangerously wounded, being speared through the\r\nback and the lower part of the body. The care and conveyance of this\r\ninvalided man was now added to Oxley's other anxieties, and it was with\r\nfeelings of great satisfaction that on November 1st they caught sight of\r\nthe rude buildings of Port Stephens. Through much hardship and privations\r\nhe had brought his party back without loss.\r\n\r\nOxley sent Evans on to Newcastle with despatches to the governor, in\r\nwhich he alluded to his sanguine anticipations at the time he had sent in\r\nhis last report, and their almost immediate collapse. But the discovery\r\nof Liverpool Plains compensated in some degree for the disappointment\r\ncaused by the renewed failure that had attended Oxley's efforts to trace\r\nan inland river.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1819, the Lady Nelson, with the Surveyor-General\r\non board, visited the newly found Port Macquarie and the Hastings River,\r\nto survey the entrance; in which task he was assisted by Lieutenant P.P.\r\nKing in the Mermaid. On his return to Port Jackson, in the same year, he\r\nmade a short excursion to Jarvis Bay with Surveyor Meehan, when they were\r\naccompanied by the explorer who was to win fame as Hamilton Hume. Oxley\r\nreturned by boat, his companions overland.\r\n\r\n3.4. THE BRISBANE RIVER.\r\n\r\nIt was in October, 1823, that Oxley left Sydney on the expedition that\r\nresulted in the finding of the Brisbane River, and the foundation of the\r\nsettlement at Moreton Bay. He was despatched on a mission to examine\r\ncertain openings on the east coast, and report on the suitability of them\r\nas sites for penal establishments. Moreton Bay, Port Curtis, and Port\r\nBowen were selected; and Oxley left in the colonial cutter Mermaid, with\r\nUniacke and Stirling as assistants.\r\n\r\nAs the cutter went up the coast, she called at Port Macquarie, and Oxley\r\nhad the pleasure of noting the rapid growth of the settlement that had\r\nbeen built upon his recommendation. Further along the coast, Oxley\r\ndiscovered and named the Tweed River. The Mermaid reached Port Curtis on\r\nthe 6th of November, and cast anchor for some time, during which Oxley\r\nmade a careful examination of the locality, his opinion of it as a site\r\nfor a settlement being decidedly unfavourable. He however discovered and\r\nnamed the Boyne River.\r\n\r\nIt being considered too late in the season to proceed and examine Port\r\nBowen, the Mermaid went south again, and entering Moreton Bay, anchored\r\noff the river that appeared to Flinders to take its source in the Glass\r\nHouse Peaks, and which he had called the Pumice Stone River.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely anchored when several natives were seen at a distance,\r\nevidently attracted by their arrival, and on examining them with the\r\ntelescope, Uniacke was struck with the appearance of one of a much\r\nlighter colour than that of his companions. The next day Oxley landed and\r\ndiscovered that the man they had noticed was in reality a castaway white\r\nman of the name of Pamphlet. He told a singular tale.\r\n\r\nHe had left Sydney in an open boat with three others, intending to go to\r\nthe Five Islands and bring back cedar. A terrible gale arose, and they\r\nwere blown out to sea and quite out of their reckoning, Pamphlet being\r\nunder the impression that they had come ashore south of Port Jackson.\r\nThey had suffered fearful hardships in the open boat, being at one time,\r\nhe averred, twenty-one days without water, during which time one man died\r\nof thirst. The boat was at last cast up on an island in the bay (Moreton\r\nIsland) where they had joined the blacks, and lived amongst them ever\r\nsince, a matter of seven months. The other survivors were named Finnegan\r\nand Parsons. Pamphlet informed Oxley that not long before the Mermaid\r\narrived, the three of them had started to try and reach Sydney overland,\r\nbut when they had got about fifty miles, he had turned back and the next\r\nday had been rejoined by Finnegan, who stated that he had quarrelled with\r\nParsons. The latter was never heard of again.\r\n\r\nFinnegan put in an appearance the next day, and Oxley naturally took the\r\nopportunity to question them as to the knowledge they had gained of the\r\nsurrounding country during their enforced stay in it. On one important\r\npoint both of them were confident, and this was that, in the southern\r\nportion of the bay, a large river was to be found which appeared\r\nnavigable, having a strong current.\r\n\r\nTaking Finnegan with them, Oxley and Stirling started in the whaleboat\r\nthe following morning to verify this information. They found the river\r\nand pulled up it about fifty miles. Oxley was greatly pleased with such a\r\ndiscovery, and landing, ascended a hill which he named Termination Hill.\r\nFrom the top he obtained a view over a wide extent of country, through\r\nwhich he was able to trace the river for a long distance. Strangely\r\nenough, the hasty glimpse he thus caught of a new and untrodden part of\r\nAustralia seemed to confirm his fixed belief in the final destination of\r\nthe Lachlan and the Macquarie as an inland sea.\r\n\r\n\"The nature of the country and a consideration of all the circumstances\r\nconnected with the appearances of the river, justify me in entertaining a\r\nstrong belief that the source of the river will not be found in\r\nmountainous country, but rather that it flows from some lake, which will\r\nprove to be the receptacle of those inland streams crossed by me during\r\nan expedition of discovery in 1818.\"\r\n\r\nOxley named the river the Brisbane, and, taking aboard the two rescued\r\nmen, the Mermaid set sail for Port Jackson, where she arrived on December\r\n13th. This ended the chapter of Oxley's discoveries in the field of\r\nactive exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. HAMILTON HUME.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Hamilton Hume, in his later life.]\r\n\r\n[Map. Hume and Hovell's Route 1824; Sturt's Route, 1829 and 1830; Major\r\nMitchell's Route 1836.]\r\n\r\n4.1. EARLY ACHIEVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nHamilton Hume was the son of the Reverend Andrew Hume, who came to the\r\ncolony with his wife in the transport Lady Juliana, and held an\r\nappointment in the Commissariat Department. Hamilton was born in\r\nParramatta in the year 1797, on the 18th of June. He seems to have been\r\nspecially marked out by Nature for prominence as an explorer, for, from\r\nhis earliest boyhood he was fond of rambling through the bush, and his\r\nfather encouraged him in his desire for a free country life and his love\r\nof adventure. School facilities were lacking, but fortunately his mother\r\nattended to his education and saw to it that he did not grow up destitute\r\nof that instruction common to youth of those times and of his standing.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen he made his initial effort at exploration in the\r\ncountry around Berrima, in company with his brother Kennedy and a black\r\nboy. They were successful in their endeavours, and found some good\r\npastoral country. In the following year, encouraged by their success, the\r\nbrothers made another excursion. In 1816, a Mr. Throsby bought some of\r\nthe land that young Kennedy and Hamilton had found; and their father sent\r\nthem out with him to show him the country he had purchased. John Oxley,\r\ntoo, held a farm in the Illawarra district, and the Surveyor-General, who\r\nmust have heard of Hamilton's repute for good bushmanship, engaged him to\r\ngo out with his overseer and guide the men on to the locality. Governor\r\nMacquarie also seems to have had his attention drawn to the same\r\nconspicuous quality, for he sent young Hume out with Meehan, a surveyor,\r\nand Throsby to examine the country about the Shoalhaven River. On the\r\nway, however, Throsby disagreed with Meehan about the course they should\r\nadopt, and, taking a black boy with him, left his companions and made the\r\nbest of his way to Port Jervis. Meehan and Hume carried out the work as\r\noriginally decided on, and then forced their way up the range, which had\r\nnow seemingly been deprived of a great many of its original terrors by\r\nthe hardy pioneers of the coast. On the highlands they discovered and\r\nnamed Lake George, a freshwater lake, and a smaller one which they called\r\nLake Bathurst, both, strange to say, seemingly isolated.\r\n\r\nHere we may remark on the tenacity with which the Murrumbidgee River long\r\neluded the eye of the white man. It is scarcely probable that Meehan and\r\nHume, who on this occasion were within comparatively easy reach of the\r\nhead waters, could have seen a new inland river at that time without\r\nmentioning the fact, but there is no record traceable anywhere as to the\r\ndate of its discovery, or the name of its finder. When in 1823 Captain\r\nCurrie and Major Ovens were led along its bank on to the beautiful\r\nManeroo country by Joseph Wild, the stream was then familiar to the early\r\nsettlers and called the Morumbidgee. Even in 1821, when Hume found the\r\nYass Plains, almost on its bank, he makes no special mention of the\r\nriver. From all this we may deduce the extremely probable fact that the\r\nposition of the river was shown to some stockrider by a native, who also\r\nconfided the aboriginal name, and so it gradually worked the knowledge of\r\nits identity into general belief. This theory is the more feasible as the\r\nriver has retained its native name. If a white man of any known position\r\nhad made the discovery, it would at once have received the name of some\r\nperson holding official sway. But this is altogether a purely\r\ngeographical digression.\r\n\r\nIt was while on this expedition that Hume found the Goulburn Plains. On\r\nanother occasion he went with Alexander Berry, a noted south-coast\r\npioneer, up the Shoalhaven River, and accompanied the party when they\r\nlanded and conducted different excursions. By the time he reached\r\nmanhood, Hume was justly classed amongst the finest bushmen in the\r\ncolony. In his after career when he led the famous expedition to the\r\nsouth coast, and again, when as Sturt's right hand he accompanied that\r\nexplorer on the notable expedition that solved the mystery of the outflow\r\nof the inland rivers and gave to settled Australia the mighty Darling, he\r\nfully proved his right to the title.\r\n\r\n4.2. DISCOVERY OF THE HUME OR MURRAY.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps by his fame as leader of the party that crossed from Lake\r\nGeorge to the Southern Ocean that Hume's name is best remembered. At that\r\ntime especially it aroused anew the bright hopes for the future of the\r\ninterior that Oxley's gloomy prognostications had done so much to\r\ndepress. The Surveyor-General having been unable to determine the\r\nquestion as to whether any large river entered the sea between Cape Otway\r\nand Spencer's Gulf, a somewhat hazardous idea entered the head of the\r\nthen Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, to land a party of convicts near\r\nWilson's Promontory, and induce them by the offer of a free pardon and a\r\ngrant of land to find their way back to Sydney overland. It was further\r\nproposed that an experienced bushman should be put in charge of them. The\r\nflattering offer of this responsible, if somewhat precarious position,\r\nwas made to young Hamilton Hume who, on mature consideration declined it.\r\n\r\nHe offered, however, to conduct a party from Lake George to Western Port\r\nif the Government would provide the necessary assistance. This offer the\r\nauthorities accepted, but they forgot the essential condition of\r\nfurnishing assistance. Naturally, much delay and vexation were caused by\r\nthis display of official ineptitude. At this juncture a retired coasting\r\nskipper, Captain William Hilton Hovell, made an offer to join the party,\r\nand find half the necessary cattle and horses. This offer aroused the\r\nGovernment to some sense of its responsibility, and it agreed to do\r\nsomething in the matter. This \"something\" amounted to six pack-saddles\r\nand gear, one tent of Parramatta cloth, two tarpaulins, a suit of slop\r\nclothes a-piece for the men, and an order to Hume to select 1,200 acres\r\nof land for himself. In addition, the Government generously granted the\r\nexplorers two skeleton charts upon which to trace the route of their\r\njourney, some bush utensils, and promised a cash payment for the hire of\r\nthe cattle should an important discovery be made. This cash payment was\r\nrefused on their return, although one would have thought that the\r\ndiscovery of the Hume (Murray) should surely take rank as an important\r\ndiscovery. Hume also stated that he had much difficulty in obtaining\r\ntickets-of-leave for the men, and the confirmation of his own order to\r\nselect land for himself.\r\n\r\nEach of the leaders brought with him three men, so that the strength of\r\nthe party was eight all told. Their outfit of animals consisted of five\r\nbullocks and three horses, and they had two carts with them.\r\n\r\nHovell was born at Yarmouth on the 26th of April, 1786. He arrived in\r\nSydney in 1813, but after being engaged in the coasting trade with\r\noccasional trips to New Zealand, he had relinquished his career as a\r\nsailor and had settled at Narellan, New South Wales. After his exploring\r\nexpedition with Hume, he settled down at Goulburn, and he died at Sydney\r\nin 1876.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October, 1824, Hume and Hovell left Lake George. Reaching\r\nthe Murrumbidgee, they found that river flooded, and after waiting three\r\ndays for the water to fall, they crossed it borne on the body of one of\r\ntheir carts, with the wheels detached, and with the aid of the tarpaulin,\r\nrigged like a punt. South of the Murrumbidgee the country was broken and\r\ndifficult to traverse, but it was well grassed and admirably adapted for\r\ngrazing purposes. As it became too rough for the passage of their carts,\r\nthese were abandoned, and the baggage and rations were packed on the\r\nbullocks for the remainder of their journey.\r\n\r\nAfter following the course of the Murrumbidgee for some days, the\r\ntravellers turned from its bank and pursued a south-westerly direction,\r\nwhich led them through hills and valleys richly grassed and plenteously\r\nendowed with running streams. On the 8th of November they beheld a sight\r\nrarely witnessed before by white men in Australia. Ascending a range in\r\norder to obtain a view of the country ahead of them, they suddenly found\r\nthemselves confronted with snow-capped mountains. There, under the\r\nbrilliant sun of an Australian summer's day, rose the white crests of\r\nlofty peaks that might have found fitting surroundings amidst the\r\nchilling splendours of some far southern clime, robed as they were for\r\nnearly one-fourth of their height in glistening snow.\r\n\r\nSkirting this range, which received the name of the Australian Alps, the\r\nexplorers, after wandering for eight days across its many spurs, came\r\nupon a fine, flowing river, which Hume named after his father, the Hume.\r\nThis river was destined to be re-named the Murray, when its course was\r\neventually followed to the ocean.*\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 6.\r\n\r\nThere being no safe ford, a makeshift boat was constructed with the aid\r\nof the serviceable tarpaulin, and the Hume was crossed, close to the site\r\nof the present town of Albury. Still passing through good pastoral land,\r\nwatered by numerous creeks, they crossed a river which was named the\r\nOvens, and on the 3rd of December they came to another, named by them the\r\nHovell, but now called the Goulburn; and on the 16th of December they\r\nreached their goal, the shore of the Southern Ocean, at the spot where\r\nGeelong now stands.\r\n\r\nThis expedition had a great and immediate influence on the extension of\r\nAustralian settlement. Within a few years after the chief surveyor had\r\ncharacterised the western interior, beyond a certain limit, as unfitted\r\nfor human habitation, and had expressed his opinion that the monotonous\r\nflats across which he vainly looked for any elevation extended to the\r\nsea-coast, snowy mountains, feeding the head tributaries of perennial\r\nrivers had been discovered to the southward of his track.\r\n\r\nHume was exceptionally fitted for the work of exploration at this\r\nparticular juncture in colonial history. Born and reared in the land, he\r\nwas well competent to judge justly of its merits and demerits; his\r\nopinion was not likely to be tainted by the prejudices formed and\r\nnourished in other and different climes. The history of Australian\r\nexploration was then a statement of hasty conclusions, formed perhaps\r\nunder certain climatic circumstances to be falsified on a subsequent\r\nvisit when the conditions were radically different. In Hume's case, there\r\nwas no ill-founded conclusion of the availability of the\r\nfreshly-discovered district. The journey just recorded at once added to\r\nthe British Colonial Empire millions of acres of arable land watered by\r\nnever-failing rivers, with a climate and altitude calculated to foster\r\nthe growth of almost every species of temperate fruit or grain.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the narration of an expedition fraught with so\r\nmuch benefit to the young colony, and executed with so much courage,\r\nendurance, and facility of resource should be marred by any discordant\r\nnote. But friendly and genial relations were endangered by the presence\r\nof two independent leaders. Divided authority here, as it nearly always\r\ndoes, caused petty and undignified squabbles, which were in later days\r\nelaborated into unseemly paper conflict. It is painful if somewhat\r\namusing to read of the acrid disputes as to the course, under the very\r\nshadow of the majestic Australian Alps whose solitude had only then been\r\nfirst disturbed by white men; and how, on agreeing to separate and divide\r\nthe outfit, it was proposed to cut the only tent in two, and how the one\r\nfrying-pan was broken by both men pulling at it. Thomas Boyd, who was the\r\nonly survivor of the party in 1883, and was then eighty-six years old,\r\nsigned a document assigning to Hume the full credit of conducting the\r\nexpedition to safety. Boyd was one of the most active members of the\r\nexpedition, always to the front when there was any trying work to be\r\ndone. He was the first white man to cross the Hume River, swimming over\r\nwith the end of a line in his teeth.\r\n\r\nAfter Hume's return he lived for some time quietly on his farm, until the\r\ncall of the wild drew him forth from his retirement to join Sturt in his\r\nfirst battle with the wilderness. His temporary association with that\r\nexplorer will find its due place in the account of that expedition.* He\r\ndied at Yass, near the scene of one of his early exploits.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Charles Sturt. 6.2. The Darling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Allan Cunningham.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1. COASTAL EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\nAllan Cunningham, the great botanical explorer of Australia, was born at\r\nWimbledon, near London, in 1791. He received a good education, his father\r\nintending him for the law; but he preferred gardening, and obtained a\r\nposition under Mr. Aiton, at Kew. In 1814 he went to Brazil, where he\r\nmade large collections of dried specimens, living plants, and seeds. Here\r\nhe remained two years, collecting in the vicinity of Rio, the Organ\r\nMountains, San Paolo, and other parts of Brazil. Sir Joseph Banks wrote\r\nthat his collections, especially of orchids, bromeliads, and bulbs, \"did\r\ncredit to the expedition and honour to the Royal Gardens.\" He was\r\nnominated for service in New South Wales, and landed at Port Jackson on\r\nthe 21st of December, 1816.* He first started collecting about the\r\npresent suburb of Woolloomooloo in Sydney, which we may infer therefrom\r\npresented a very different appearance from that which it now presents. He\r\nnext went with Oxley on his Lachlan expedition. On his return, he\r\ncommenced the first of his five coastal voyages, in which he accompanied\r\nCaptain P.P. King around most of the continent of Australia. In the tiny\r\ncutter the Mermaid, of 84 tons, they left Port Jackson on the 22nd of\r\nDecember, 1817, and sailed round the south coast of Australia to King\r\nGeorge's Sound, the west coast, the north coast, and finally to Timor.\r\nThe Mermaid returned by the same route and anchored in Port Jackson on\r\nthe 24th of July, 1818. Again on the 24th of December, the Mermaid left\r\nPort Jackson on a short trip to Tasmania, from which they returned in\r\nFebruary, 1819. Once more the busy little Mermaid sailed from Sydney on\r\nthe 8th of May, 1819, to make a running survey of the east coast. On this\r\nvoyage, many ports hitherto unvisited were examined by King, and amongst\r\nother places, Cunningham paid his first visit to the Endeavour River.\r\nContinuing the survey, she rounded Cape York, crossed the mouth of the\r\nCarpentaria Gulf, and kept along the north coast, where King found\r\nCambridge Gulf. At Cassini Island, the Mermaid left for Timor, and\r\neventually returned to Sydney round the west coast of Australia.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] For the accompanying notes of Allan Cunningham's earlier\r\nlifework I am indebted to the Biographical Notes concerning Allan\r\nCunningham, compiled by Mr. J.H. Maiden, Director of the Sydney Botanical\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of June, 1820, the Mermaid was again busy with King and\r\nCunningham on board, and, sailing up the east coast she re-visited the\r\nEndeavour River. During their stay, Cunningham ascended Mount Cook, where\r\nhe made a fine collection of seeds and plants. She coasted north again\r\nand picked up the survey at Cassini Island once more. At Careening Bay,\r\nwhere they had occasion to stay for some time, Cunningham was again very\r\nfortunate in his collections. Returning homeward by way of the west and\r\nsouth coasts, the little cutter was almost wrecked off Botany Bay.\r\n\r\nThe Mermaid was now overhauled and condemned, and in her place H.M.\r\nStoreship Dromedary, re-christened the Bathurst, was placed under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant King. This was Cunningham's fifth voyage as\r\ncollector with the same commander -- a very clear proof of their\r\ncompatibility of tastes and temperament. As before, the Bathurst ran\r\nround the east coast and resumed her work on the north-west of Australia.\r\nWhile thus engaged she was found to be in a dangerous condition, and went\r\nto Port Louis to refit. They sailed from Mauritius on the 15th of\r\nNovember, and reached King George's Sound on the 24th of December. Here\r\nCunningham found that the garden he had been at great pains to form\r\nduring his visit in 1818 had disappeared altogether. The Bathurst stayed\r\nsome weeks on the south-west coast, and then shaped a course to Port\r\nJackson, where they arrived on the 25th of April, 1822. Of the botany of\r\nthese coastal surveys Cunningham published a sketch entitled A Few\r\nGeneral Remarks on the Vegetation of Certain Coasts of Terra Australis,\r\nand more especially of its North-Western Shore.\r\n\r\n5.2. PANDORA'S PASS.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to his record as an inland explorer of Australia.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of March, 1823, Allan Cunningham left Bathurst with two\r\nobjects in view. One was his favourite pursuit of botany; and the other\r\nthe discovery of an available route to Oxley's Liverpool Plains, through\r\nthe range that bounded it on the south; a route which Lawson and Scott\r\nhad vainly sought for the preceding year. On reaching the vicinity of the\r\nrange, he searched in vain to the eastward for any opening that would\r\nenable him to pierce the barrier. He then retraced his steps, and,\r\nexploring more to the eastward, he came upon a pass through a low part of\r\nthe mountain belt which he considered practicable and easy. The valley\r\nleading to the pass he named Hawkesbury Vale, and the pass itself\r\nPandora's Pass, inasmuch as, in spite of the hardships the party had been\r\nput to, they had still hoped to find it. Here Cunningham left a parchment\r\ndocument, stating that the information thereon contained was for the\r\nfirst farmer \"who may venture to advance as far to the northward as this\r\nvale.\" The finding of the bottle which contained this scroll has never\r\nbeen recorded. Bathurst was reached on their return journey, on June\r\n27th.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1824, he botanised about the heads of the Murrumbidgee and the\r\nMonaro and Shoalhaven Gullies, and in September of the same year, went\r\nnorth by sea with Oxley to Moreton Bay, to investigate that locality and\r\npronounce on its suitability as a settlement site. In March, 1825, he\r\nleft Parramatta, threaded the Pandora Pass once more, and ascended to\r\nLiverpool Plains, returning to Parramatta on the 17th of June. In 1826\r\nand the beginning of the following year, he visited New Zealand.\r\n\r\n5.3. THE DARLING DOWNS.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1827 that Cunningham accomplished his most notable\r\njourney of exploration, one which eventually threw open to settlement an\r\nentirely new area of country; country destined to mould the destiny of\r\nthe yet unborn colony of Queensland, and afford homes for thousands of\r\nsettlers. It was mainly by his exertions that the young community at\r\nMoreton Bay was able to stretch its growing limbs to the westward\r\nimmediately after its birth, instead of waiting long weary years and\r\nwasting its strength against an impassable obstacle as had been the fate\r\nof the settlement at Farm Cove.\r\n\r\nCunningham started from Segenhoe, a station on one of the head\r\ntributaries of the Hunter River, whence he ascended the main range\r\nwithout any difficulty beyond having to unload some of the pack-horses\r\nduring the steepest part of the ascent. He had with him six men, eleven\r\nhorses, and provisions for fourteen weeks. He left civilisation, or the\r\noutskirts of it, on the 2nd of May, and on the 11th he crossed the\r\nparallel on which Oxley had crossed the Peel River in 1818, and once\r\nbeyond that point he was traversing unexplored country. The land was\r\nsuffering under a prolonged drought in that district, and most of the\r\nstreams encountered had but detached pools of water in their beds, at one\r\nof which, however, his party caught a good haul of cod, which were such\r\nravenous biters and so heavy that several were lost in the attempt to\r\nland them.\r\n\r\nTravelling through open forest land, which was suffering more or less\r\nfrom the want of rain, Cunningham came on the 19th of May to a valley.\r\nHere, on the bank of a creek he encamped on \"the most luxuriant pasture\r\nwe had met since we had left the Hunter.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were not a little surprised,\" he says, \"to observe at this valley, so\r\nremote from any farming establishment, the traces of horned cattle, only\r\ntwo or three days old, as also the spots on which about eight to a dozen\r\nof these animals had reposed.\r\n\r\n\"From what point of the country these cattle had originally strayed\r\nappeared at first difficult to determine. On consideration, however, it\r\nwas thought by no means impossible that they were stragglers from the\r\nlarge wild herds that are well-known to be occupying plains around\r\nArbuthnot Range.\"\r\n\r\nThis speaks volumes for the wonderful increase and spread of wild cattle\r\nin those days; Arbuthnot Range, first sighted by Evans in 1817, being\r\nalready an acknowledged resort of wild cattle in seven years. Or it\r\nadvertises the negligence of the stockmen who guarded the comparatively\r\ntiny herds of the period.\r\n\r\nThe dry weather had put its mark upon the country. Though the degree of\r\naridity was much less than that afterwards experienced in Australia by\r\nthe explorers of its interior, nevertheless conditions were sufficiently\r\ndry to compel the leader to exercise great forethought, and Cunningham\r\ndetermined to pursue a more easterly course, keeping nearer the crest of\r\nthe range, where he was more likely to find grass and water. The country\r\nhe passed through was inferior, but on the 28th he came to the bank of a\r\nriver \"presenting a handsome reach, half-a-mile in length, thirty yards\r\nwide, and evidently very deep.\" This river he named the Dumaresque, and\r\nit led him to the northward, through what he considered poor land, until\r\nthe new-found river took an easterly direction, when the party left it,\r\nstill keeping north. At the end of the month, after passing through much\r\nscrubby country, they were agreeably surprised to meet with a stream, the\r\nbanks of which presented an appearance of great verdure. \"It was a\r\nsubject of great astonishment to us to meet with so beautiful a sward of\r\ngrass permanently watered by an active stream, after traversing that\r\ntract of desert forest, and penetrating brushes the extremes of sterility\r\nin its immediate vicinity.\"\r\n\r\nThis was named McIntyre's Brook, and Cunningham writes that they had some\r\ndifficulty in fording it on account of its extreme rapidity. The party\r\ncontinued on, now in a north-easterly direction, passing again through\r\ndense thickets such as they had formerly met with.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June, Cunningham, from a small elevation, had a view of\r\nopen country of decidedly favourable appearance: \"A hollow in the forest\r\nridge immediately before us allowed me distinctly to perceive that at a\r\ndistance of eight or nine miles, open plains or downs of great extent\r\nappeared to extend easterly to the base of a lofty range of mountains,\r\nlying south and north, distant by estimation about thirty miles.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Cunningham's first glimpse of the now world-famous Darling\r\nDowns. On reaching the commencement of the great plains, they came to the\r\n\"bank of a small river, about fifteen yards in breadth, having a brisk\r\ncurrent to the North-West.\" As there was deep water in the pools of this\r\nriver, the men anticipated some good fishing, and they were not\r\ndisappointed. Cunningham named this river the Condamine.\r\n\r\nAlthough their provisions were failing them, Cunningham remained for some\r\ntime on the site of his new discovery, fully impressed with the certainty\r\nof its immense importance in the future settlement of Australia. Peel's\r\nPlains and Canning Downs were named by him, and to the north-west \"beyond\r\nPeel's Plains an immeasurable extent of flat country met the eye, on\r\nwhich not the slightest eminence could be observed to interrupt the\r\ncommon level, which, in consequence of the very clear state of the\r\natmosphere, could be discerned to a very distant blue line of horizon.\"\r\n\r\nCunningham's far-seeing mind fathomed the future requirements of such a\r\nvast agricultural and pastoral extent of country, and he at once turned\r\nhis attention to its natural means of communication with its obvious\r\nport, Moreton Bay. A lofty range of mountains to the east and north-east\r\nseemed to offer a difficult barrier, and he determined upon making a\r\ncloser inspection. As his horses were recruiting all the time on the\r\nluxuriant herbage, he did not so much regret their own scarcity of\r\nrations. Finding a beautiful grassy valley which he named Logan Vale,\r\nafter Captain Logan, the well-known commandant of Moreton Bay, leading to\r\nthe base of the principal range, he proceeded to make a nearer\r\ninspection. After much climbing of successive tiers or ridges, he gained\r\nthe loftiest point of a main spur, and through some gaps in the main\r\nrange itself, he was able to overlook portions of the country in the\r\nvicinity of Moreton Bay, and even to recognise the cone of Mount Warning.\r\nHe took particular notice of one gap, and on closer inspection he came to\r\nthe conclusion that a line of road could be constructed without much\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nHaving spent a week on the Downs, and his shortness of provisions and the\r\nweakness of his horses preventing any excursion to the western interior,\r\nas his intention had been, he set out on his homeward journey on the 18th\r\nof June. In order to render his chart of the country traversed as\r\ncomplete as possible, he kept a course about equidistant between the\r\nroute of his outward journey and the coastal watershed. He reached\r\nSegenhoe on the 28th of July, bringing his men and horses back in safety,\r\nafter one of the most successful and important expeditions on the east\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Memorial to Allan Cunningham, Botanical Gardens, Sydney.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, accompanied by his old companion Fraser, who had\r\nbeen one of Oxley's party on his two inland expeditions, Cunningham\r\nproceeded by sea to Moreton Bay, with the intention of starting from the\r\nsettlement, identifying the gap he had taken particular notice of, and\r\nconnecting with his former camp on the Downs. In this attempt he was also\r\naccompanied by Captain Logan, but they were unsuccessful. Then Cunningham\r\nagain went from the outpost of Limestone, with three men and two\r\nbullocks, and was completely satisfied. A road through this gap on to the\r\nDarling Downs was immediately constructed, and used until the\r\nintroduction of railway communication: the opening was known far and wide\r\nas Cunningham's Gap.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1830, Cunningham went to Norfolk Island. While there he crossed\r\nto the little islet adjoining, known as Phillip Island. Having landed\r\nwith three men, he sent the boat back. That night eleven convicts\r\nescaped, seized the boat, and were launching her when they were\r\nchallenged by a sentry. One of them replied that they were going for Mr.\r\nCunningham, and they got away though they were fired upon. They did go\r\nfor Mr. Cunningham, and robbed him of his chronometer, pistols, tent, and\r\nprovisions. Then they sailed away, and were picked up by a whaler, which\r\nthey seized and finally scuttled. The Government refused to compensate\r\nCunningham for his loss, and he had to replace the instruments himself.\r\n\r\nCunningham left Sydney on the 25th of February, 1831, on a visit to\r\nLondon, where he spent nearly two years at Kew, returning to Sydney on\r\nthe 12th of February, 1837. He was appointed Colonial Botanist and\r\nSuperintendent of the Botanic Gardens, but did not retain the position\r\nvery long, being disgusted to find that supplying Government officials\r\nwith vegetables was to be a chief part of his duties. He resigned, and\r\nafter another visit to New Zealand, whence he returned in 1838, so ill\r\nwas he that he was compelled to decline to accompany Captain Wickham on\r\nhis survey of the north-west coast. He died of consumption on the 24th of\r\nJanuary, 1839, at the cottage in the Botanic Gardens, whither he had been\r\nremoved for change of air and scene. He was buried in the Devonshire\r\nStreet cemetery, and on the 25th of May, 1901, his remains were removed\r\nto the obelisk in the Botanic Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. CHARLES STURT.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.1. EARLY LIFE.\r\n\r\nCharles Sturt was born in India at Chunar-Ghur, on April the 28th, 1795.\r\nHis father, Thomas Lennox Napier Sturt, was a puisne Judge in Bengal\r\nunder the East India Company; his mother was Jeanette Wilson. The Sturts\r\nwere an old Dorsetshire family. In 1799, Charles, as was common with most\r\nAnglo-Indian children, was sent home to England, to the care of his\r\naunts, Mrs. Wood and Miss Wilson, at Newton Hall, Middlewich. He went\r\nfirst to a private school at Astbury, and in 1810 was sent to Harrow. On\r\nthe 9th of September, 1813, he was gazetted as Ensign in the 39th\r\nRegiment of Foot. He served with his regiment in the Pyrenees, and in a\r\ndesultory campaign in Canada. When Napoleon escaped from Elba, the 39th\r\nreturned to Europe, but all too late to join in the victory of Waterloo,\r\nand it was stationed with the Army of Occupation in the north of France.\r\nIn 1818, the regiment was sent to Ireland. Here for several years Sturt\r\nremained in most uncongenial surroundings, watching smugglers, seizing\r\nillicit stills, and assisting to quell a rising of the Whiteboys. It was\r\nin Ireland that the devoted John Harris, his soldier-servant, who was\r\nafterwards the companion of his Australian wanderings, was first attached\r\nto him. In 1823, Sturt was gazetted Lieutenant, and his promotion to\r\nCaptain followed in 1825.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1826, he sailed for New South Wales with a detachment of his\r\nregiment, in charge of convicts. The moment he set foot on this vast\r\nunknown land, its chief geographical enigma at once occupied his\r\nattention. Sir Ralph Darling, to whom he acted for some time as private\r\nsecretary, formed a high opinion of his tact and ability, and appointed\r\nhim Major of Brigade and Military Secretary.\r\n\r\n6.2. THE DARLING.\r\n\r\nAs soon as an expedition inland was mooted, Sturt volunteered for the\r\nleadership, and was recommended by Oxley, who was then on his deathbed.\r\nThe recommendation was adopted by Governor Darling, and Sturt embarked on\r\nthe career of exploration that was to render his name immortal.\r\n\r\nIt was ever Sturt's misfortune to be the sport of the seasons; drought\r\nand its attendant desolation dogged his footsteps like an evil genius.\r\nOxley had followed, or attempted to follow, the rivers down when a long\r\nperiod of recurrent wet seasons had saturated the soil, filled the swamps\r\nand marshes, and swollen the river-courses so that they appeared to be\r\nnavigable throughout for boats. Sturt came at a period when the country\r\nlay faint under a prolonged drought and the rivers had dwindled down into\r\ndry channels, with here and there a parched and meagre water-hole. The\r\nfollowing description of his is too often quoted as depicting the usual\r\nstate of the Australian interior:--\r\n\r\n\"In the creeks, weeds had grown and withered, and grown again; and young\r\nsaplings were now rising in their beds, nourished by the moisture that\r\nstill remained; but the large forest trees were drooping, and many were\r\ndead. The emus with outstretched necks, gasping for breath, search the\r\nchannels of the rivers for water in vain; and the native dog, so thin\r\nthat he could hardly walk, seemed to implore some merciful hand to\r\ndespatch him.\"\r\n\r\n[Map. Sturt's Route. Hume and Hovell's Route 1824.]\r\n\r\nTo Sturt and his companions, who were the first white men to face the\r\ninterior during a season of drought, the scene may not have seemed too\r\nhighly-coloured; but, in common with many of Sturt's graphic\r\nword-pictures, his description applies only to special or rare\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, no rain had fallen for two years, and even the dwellers on the\r\ncoastal lands began to despair of copious rainfalls. Whenever their\r\nglance wandered over their own dried-up pastures, men's thoughts\r\nnaturally turned to that widespread and boundless swamp wherein the\r\nMacquarie was lost to Oxley's quest; and many saw in the drought a\r\nfavourable opportunity to discover the ultimate destination of these lost\r\nrivers. An expedition to the west was accordingly prepared in order to\r\nsolve the problem under these very different existing circumstances, and\r\nSturt was selected as leader. To Hamilton Hume was offered the position\r\nof second in command, and, as the dry weather had brought all farming\r\noperations to a standstill, he was able to accept it. Besides Sturt and\r\nHume, the party consisted of two soldiers and eight prisoners, two of the\r\nlatter being taken to return with despatches as soon as they had reached\r\nthe limit of the known country. They also had with them eight riding and\r\nseven pack-horses, and two draught and eight pack-bullocks. A small boat\r\nrigged up on a wheeled carriage was also taken; but like many others\r\ncarried into the interior, it never served any useful purpose.\r\n\r\nThe country was by this time well-known, and partly settled up to and\r\nbelow Wellington Vale; but when Sturt reached Mount Harris, Oxley's\r\nformer depot camp, he had come to the verge of the unknown, and halted in\r\norder to consider as to his immediate movements. He consulted with Hume,\r\nand as there seemed to be no present obstacle to their progress, it was\r\ndetermined, as Sturt writes, \"to close with the marshes.\"\r\n\r\nThis they did much sooner than was expected, for at the end of the first\r\nday's march their camp was set in the very midst of the reeds. A halt for\r\na couple of days was made, whilst Sturt prepared his despatches to the\r\nGovernor. On the 26th, the two messengers were sent off to Bathurst, and\r\nthe progress of the party was resumed. Before the day closed, they found\r\nthemselves on a dreary expanse of flats and of desolate reed beds. The\r\nprogress of the main body was thus suddenly and completely checked, and\r\nSturt decided to launch the boat and with two men endeavour to trace the\r\ncourse of the river, while Hume and two others endeavoured to find an\r\nopening to the northward.\r\n\r\nThe boat voyage soon terminated, for Sturt was as completely baffled as\r\nOxley had been. The channel ceased altogether, and the boat quietly\r\ngrounded. Sturt could do nothing but return to camp and await Hume's\r\nreport. All search for the lost river proved vain.\r\n\r\nHume had found a serpentine sheet of water to the north which he was\r\ninclined to think was the continuation of the elusive Macquarie. He had\r\npushed on past it, but had been checked by another body of reed beds. It\r\nwas decided to shift camp to this lagoon and launch the boat once more;\r\nbut without result, for the boat was hauled ashore again after having\r\nvainly followed the supposed channel in amongst reeds and shallows. Again\r\nthe leader and his second went forward on a scouting trip. Each took with\r\nthem two men; Sturt going to the north-west, and Hume to the north-east.\r\nThey left on the last day of December, 1828.\r\n\r\nSturt toiled on until after sunset he came to a northward-flowing creek,\r\nin which there was a fair supply of water. Next day their course lay\r\nthrough plains intersected with belts of scrub, and they discovered\r\nanother creek, inferior to the last one both in size and the quality of\r\nthe water. They camped for a few hours on its bank, and Sturt called it\r\nNew Year's Creek, but it is now known as the Bogan River. They were about\r\nto pass that night without water on the edge of a dry plain, when one of\r\nthe men had his attention drawn to the flight of a pigeon, and searching,\r\nfound a puddle of rain water which barely satisfied them. An isolated\r\nhill with perpendicular sides, which Sturt had noticed for some time, now\r\nattracted his attention, as being a lofty point of vantage from which to\r\nget an extensive view to the west. They accordingly made for it, over\r\nmore promising country. They reached the hill which Sturt called Oxley's\r\nTableland, but from its summit he saw nothing but a stretch of monotonous\r\nplain, with no sign of the long-sought river. That night they camped at a\r\nsmall swamp, and the next morning turned back, Sturt agreeing with Oxley,\r\nbut without as much reason, that \"the space I traversed is unlikely to\r\nbecome the haunt of civilised man.\" Hume did not return until the day\r\nafter Sturt's arrival. He reported that the Castlereagh River must have\r\nsuddenly turned to the north below where Oxley crossed it, for he had\r\nbeen unable to find it. He had gone westward, but had seen nothing except\r\nfar-stretching plains. After a few aimless and unprofitable ramblings,\r\nthey made their way again to Oxley's Tableland, and Sturt and Hume, with\r\ntwo men, made a journey to the west, with only a negative result. On the\r\n31st of January they commenced to follow down Sturt's New Year's Creek,\r\nand the next day, to their unbounded surprise, came upon the bank of a\r\nnoble river. From its size and width they judged they had struck it at a\r\npoint as far from its source as from its termination; but when the men\r\nrushed tumultuously down the bank to revel in the water and quench their\r\nthirst, they cried out, with disgust and surprise, that the water was\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nPoor Sturt, whose heart was bounding with joy at the realisation of his\r\nfondest hopes in this important discovery of a river which seemed to\r\nanswer all men's dreams and anticipations, felt the sudden revulsion of\r\ndespair. One saving thought he had, and that was that they were close to\r\nits junction with the inland sea. Meantime, although human tracks were to\r\nbe seen everywhere, they saw none of the aborigines. Hume at length found\r\na pool of fresh water, which provided them with water for themselves and\r\ntheir stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. The Darling River, at Sturt's first view point. Photo by\r\nthe Reverend J. Milne Curran.]\r\n\r\nThe long-continued absence of rain having lowered the fresh water so that\r\nthe supply from the brine springs on the banks predominated, was the\r\nexplanation of the saltness of the water; but Sturt did not know this,\r\nand for six days the party moved slowly down the river until the\r\ndiscovery of saline springs in the bank convinced the leader that the\r\nsaltness was of local origin. Still that did not supply them with the\r\nnecessary drinking water, and on the sixth day, leaving the men encamped\r\nat a small supply of fresh water, Sturt and Hume pushed on to look for\r\nmore, but in vain, and Sturt was compelled to order a retreat to Mount\r\nHarris.\r\n\r\nThis shows how the exploration of the continent has ever been conditioned\r\nby the uncertainty of the seasons. Had Sturt found the Darling in a\r\nnormal season, he would probably have followed it down to its junction\r\nwith the Murray, and the geographical system of the east would have been\r\nat once laid bare. But it was not in such a simple manner that the great\r\nriver basin was to become known. Toil, privation, and the sacrifice of\r\nhuman lives, had first to be suffered.\r\n\r\nTo the river which he had found Sturt gave the name Darling, in honour of\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nThe return journey to Mount Harris continued without interruption. At\r\nMount Harris they expected to find fresh supplies; but as they approached\r\nthe place they could not restrain fears with regard to their safety. The\r\nsurrounding reed beds were in flames in all parts. The few natives that\r\nwere met with displayed a guilty timidity, and one was observed wearing a\r\njacket. Fortunately, however, their fears were groundless; the relief\r\nparty had arrived and had been awaiting their return for about three\r\nweeks. An attack by the natives had been made, but it had been easily\r\nrepulsed. While Sturt rested at Mount Harris, Hume struck off to the\r\nwest, beyond the reeds. He reported the country as superior for thirty\r\nmiles to any they had yet seen, but beyond that limit lay brushwood and\r\nmonotonous plains.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of March the party struck camp and departed for the\r\nCastlereagh River. They found that the flooded stream, impassable by\r\nOxley, had totally disappeared. Not a drop of water lay in the bed of the\r\nriver. They commenced to follow its course down, and the old harassing\r\nhunt for water had to be conducted anew. No wonder that Sturt could never\r\nfree himself from the memory of his fiery baptism as Australian explorer,\r\nand that his mental picture of the country was ever shrouded in the haze\r\nof drought and heat.\r\n\r\nAs they descended the Castlereagh into the level lower country, they were\r\ngreatly delayed by the many intricate windings of the river and its\r\nmultiplicity of channels. On the 29th of March they again reached the\r\nDarling, ninety miles above the place where they had first come upon it,\r\nand they observed the same characteristics as before, including the\r\nsaltness. This was a blow to Sturt, who had hoped to find it free from\r\nsalinity. Fortunately they were not distressed for fresh water at the\r\ntime, and knowing what to expect if the river was followed down again,\r\nthe party halted and formed a camp.\r\n\r\nThe next day Sturt, Hume, and two men crossed the river and made a short\r\njourney of investigation to the west, to see what fortune held for them\r\nfurther afield. Not having passed during the day \"a drop of water or a\r\nblade of grass,\" they found themselves by mid-afternoon on a wide plain\r\nthat stretched far away to the horizon. Sturt writes that had there been\r\nthe slightest encouragement afforded by any change in the country, he\r\nwould even then have pushed forward, \"but we had left all traces of the\r\nnatives behind us, and this seemed a desert they never entered -- that\r\nnot even a bird inhabited.\"\r\n\r\nBack to Mount Harris once more, where they arrived on the 7th of April,\r\n1829. On their way they had stopped to follow a depression first noticed\r\nby Hume, and decided that it was the channel of the overflow of the\r\nMacquarie Marshes.\r\n\r\n6.3. THE PASSAGE OF THE MURRAY.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the Macquarie was now, to a certain extent, cleared away,\r\nbut the course and final outlet of the Darling now presented another\r\nriddle, which Sturt too was destined to solve.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of such a large river as the Darling, augmented by the\r\nMacquarie and Castlereagh, and (so people then thought) in all\r\nprobability the Lachlan, naturally inflamed public curiosity as to the\r\nposition of the outlet on the Australian coast. All the rivers that had\r\nbeen tried as guides to the hidden interior having failed to answer the\r\npurpose, the Murrumbidgee -- the beautiful river of the aboriginals --\r\nwas selected as the scene of the next attempt. There were good reasons\r\nfor the choice: it derived its volume from the highest known mountains,\r\nsnow-capped peaks in fact, that reminded the spectator of far northern\r\nlatitudes, and thus it was to a great extent independent of the variable\r\nlocal rainfall.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sturt was naturally selected to be the leader of the Murrumbidgee\r\nexpedition, and with him as second went George MacLeay, the son of the\r\nthen Colonial Secretary. Harris, who had been Sturt's soldier-servant for\r\nnearly eighteen years, and two other men of the 39th, who had been with\r\ntheir Captain on the Macquarie expedition, also accompanied him, with a\r\nvery complete and well-furnished party, including the usual boat rigged\r\nup on a carriage. This time, however, unlike the craft that had\r\naccompanied previous exploring parties, the whaleboat was destined to be\r\nimmortalised in Australian history.\r\n\r\nSettlement had by this time extended well up to and down the banks of the\r\nMurrumbidgee, and Sturt took his departure from the borders of\r\ncivilisation about where the town of Gundagai now stands, almost at the\r\njunction of the Tumut River, at Whaby's station. The course for some time\r\nlay along the rich river-flats of the Murrumbidgee. The blacks, who of\r\ncourse from their position were familiar with the presence of white men,\r\nmaintained a friendly demeanour. One slight excursion to the north was\r\nmade to connect with Oxley's furthest south, made when on his Lachlan\r\nexpedition; but though they did not actually verify the spot, Sturt\r\nreckoned that he went within twenty miles of it, showing how narrowly\r\nthat explorer had missed the discovery of the Murrumbidgee.\r\n\r\nAs they got lower down the river they found themselves travelling through\r\nthe flat desolate country that reminded them only too forcibly of late\r\nexperiences on the Macquarie. Owing to some information gleaned from the\r\nnatives, Sturt and MacLeay rode north to try and again come upon the\r\nLachlan. They struck a dry channel, which Sturt believed was the drainage\r\nfrom the Lachlan into the Murrumbidgee. This proved to be correct, as\r\nnatives afterwards testified that they had seen the two white men\r\nactually on the Lachlan.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, which was an intensely hot day, MacLeay, who was on ahead,\r\nfound himself suddenly confronted with a boundless sea of reeds, and the\r\nriver itself had suddenly vanished. He sent a mounted messenger back to\r\nSturt with these disastrous tidings. Sturt thereupon turned the drays,\r\nwhich were already in difficulties in the loose soil, sharp round to the\r\nright, and finally came to the river again, where they camped to discuss\r\nthe untoward circumstance.\r\n\r\nAt daylight the next morning, Sturt and MacLeay rode along its bank,\r\nwhilst Clayton, the carpenter, was set to work felling a tree and digging\r\na sawpit. Progress along the bank with the whole party was evidently\r\nimpossible. Sturt, however, had faith in the continuity of the river, and\r\nannounced to MacLeay his intention to send back most of the expedition,\r\nand with a picked crew to embark in the whaleboat, committing their\r\ndesperate fortunes to the stream, and trusting to make the coast\r\nsomewhere, and leaving their return in the hands of Providence.\r\n\r\nThe more one regards this heroic venture, the more sublime does it\r\nappear. The whole of the interior was then a sealed book, and the river,\r\nfor aught Sturt knew, might flow throughout the length of the continent.\r\nBut the voyage was commenced with cool and calm confidence.\r\n\r\nIn a week the whaleboat was put together, and a small skiff also built.\r\nSix hands were selected for the crew, and the remainder, after waiting\r\none week in case of accident, were to return to Goulburn Plains and there\r\nawait events. It would be as well to embody here the names of this band.\r\nJohn Harris, Hopkinson, and Fraser were the soldiers chosen, and Clayton,\r\nMulholland, and Macmanee the prisoners. The start was made at seven on\r\nthe morning of January 7th, the whale-boat towing the small skiff. Within\r\nabout fifteen miles of the point of embarkation they passed the junction\r\nof the Lachlan, and that night camped amongst a thicket of reeds. The\r\nnext day the skiff fouled a log and sank, and though it was raised to the\r\nsurface and most of the contents recovered, the bulk of them was much\r\ndamaged. Fallen and sunken logs greatly endangered their progress, but on\r\nthe 14th they \"were hurried into a broad and noble river.\" Such was the\r\nforce with which they were shot out of the Murrumbidgee that they were\r\ncarried nearly to the opposite bank of the new and ample stream. Sturt's\r\nfeelings at that moment were to be envied, and for once in a life\r\nchequered with much disappointment he must have felt that a great reward\r\nwas granted to him in this crowning discovery. He named the new river the\r\nMurray, after Sir George Murray, the head of the Colonial Department. As\r\nsome controversy has of late arisen as to the question of Sturt's right\r\nto confer the name, we here quote his own words, written after surveying\r\nthe Hume in 1838.\r\n\r\n\"When I named the Murray I was in a great measure ignorant of the other\r\nrivers with which it is connected...I want not to usurp an inch of ground\r\nor of water over which I have not passed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the bosom of the Murray they could now make use of their sail, which\r\nthe contracted space in the bed of the Murrumbidgee had before prevented\r\nthem from doing. The aborigines were seen nearly every day, and once when\r\nthe voyagers had to negotiate a very ticklish rapid, some of them\r\napproached quite close, and seemed to take great interest in the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nSturt's thoughts now turned towards the junction of the Darling, and at\r\nlast he sighted a deserted camp on which the huts resembled those he had\r\nseen on that river. On the 23rd of January they came upon the junction at\r\na very critical moment. A line of magnificently-foliaged trees came into\r\nview, among which was perceived a large gathering of blacks, who\r\napparently were inclined to be hostile. Sturt, who was at the helm, was\r\nsteering straight for them and made the customary signs of peace. Just\r\nbefore it was too late to avoid a collision, Sturt marked hostility in\r\ntheir quivering limbs and battle-lusting eyes. He instantly put the helm\r\na-starboard, and the boat sheered down the reach, the baffled natives\r\nrunning and yelling defiantly along the bank. The river, however, was\r\nshoaling rapidly, and from the opposite side there projected a sand-spit;\r\non each side of this narrow passage infuriated blacks had gathered, and\r\nthere was no mistaking their intentions. Sturt gave orders to his men as\r\nto their behaviour, and held himself ready to give the battle-signal by\r\nshooting the most active and forward of their adversaries.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of a small party of blacks who had been interested\r\nin the shooting of a rapid by the boat's crew. Four of these savages had\r\ncamped with the explorers the preceding night, leaving at daylight in the\r\nmorning. Sturt imagined that they had gone ahead as peace delegates, and\r\nhe was thus most anxious to avoid a fight. But the life of the whole\r\nparty depended on prompt action being taken, and Sturt's eye was on the\r\nleader and his finger on the trigger when \"my purpose,\" he says \"was\r\nchecked by MacLeay, who called to me that another party of blacks had\r\nmade their appearance on the left bank of the river. Turning round, I\r\nobserved four men at the top of their speed.\" These were the dusky\r\ndelegates, and the description given by Sturt of the conduct of the man\r\nwho saved the situation is very graphic:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Junction of the Darling and Murray Rivers.]\r\n\r\n\"The foremost of them, as soon as he got ahead of the boat, threw himself\r\nfrom a considerable height into the water. He struggled across the\r\nchannel to the sand-bank, and in an incredibly short space of time stood\r\nin front of the savage against whom my aim had been directed. Seizing him\r\nby the throat, he pushed him backwards, and forcing all who were in the\r\nwater on the bank, he trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation\r\nthat was exceedingly striking. At one moment pointing to the boat, at\r\nanother shaking his clenched hand in the faces of the most forward, and\r\nstamping with passion on the sand, his voice, that was at first distinct,\r\nwas lost in hoarse murmurs.\"\r\n\r\nThis episode, unequalled in the traditions of the Australian aborigines,\r\nremoved the imminent danger; and Sturt's tact, in a few moments changed\r\nthe hundreds of demented demons into a pack of laughing, curious\r\nchildren, an easy and common transition with the savage nature. But for\r\nthe intervention of this noble chief, Sturt and his followers, penned\r\nwithin the boat in shallow water, would have been massacred without a\r\nchance to defend themselves. Surrounded as they were by six hundred\r\nstalwart foes, their fate, save from unreliable native tradition, would\r\nnever have been known to their countrymen.\r\n\r\nDuring the crisis, the boat had drifted untended, and grounded on the\r\nsand. While the men were hastily pushing her off, they caught sight of \"a\r\nnew and beautiful stream coming apparently from the north.\" A crowd of\r\nnatives were assembled on the bank of the new river, and Sturt pulled\r\nacross to them, thus creating a diversion amongst his erstwhile foes, who\r\nswam after, as he says, \"like a parcel of seals.\"\r\n\r\nAfter presenting the friendly native with some acknowledgement and\r\nrefusing presents to the others, the pioneers examined the new river. The\r\nbanks were sloping and well-grassed, crowned with fine trees, and the men\r\ncried out that they had got on to an English river. To Sturt himself the\r\nmoment was supreme. He was convinced \"that we were now sailing on the\r\nbosom of that very stream from whose banks I had been twice forced to\r\nretire.\" They did not pull far up the stream, for a native fishing-net\r\nwas stretched across, and Sturt forbore to break it. The Union Jack was,\r\nhowever, run up to the peak and saluted with three cheers, and then with\r\na favouring wind they bade farewell to the Darling and the now\r\nwonderstruck natives.\r\n\r\nAs they went on, the party landed occasionally to inspect the surrounding\r\ncountry, but on all sides from their low elevation they could see nothing\r\nbut a boundless flat. The skiff being now only a drag upon them, it was\r\nbroken up and burnt for the sake of the ironwork. On account of the\r\ndamage to the salt pork caused by the sinking of this boat, the strictest\r\neconomy of diet had to be exercised, and though an abundance of fish was\r\ncaught, they had become unattractive to their palates. The continuation\r\nof the voyage down the course of the Murray was henceforth a monotonous\r\nrepetition of severe daily toil at the oar. The natives whom they\r\nencountered, though friendly, became a nuisance from the constant\r\nhandling and embracing that the voyagers had, from purposes of policy, to\r\nsuffer unchecked. The tribes met with were more than ordinarily filthy,\r\nand were disfigured by loathsome skin diseases. After twenty-one days on\r\nthe water, Sturt began to look most anxiously for indications of the sea,\r\nfor his men were fagging with the unremitting labour and short rations,\r\nand they had only the strength of their own arms to rely on for their\r\nreturn against the current. Soon, however, an old man amongst the natives\r\ndescribed the roaring of the waves, and showed by other signs that he had\r\nbeen to the sea coast. But more welcome than all were some flocks of\r\nsea-gulls that flew over and welcomed the tired men.\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-third day after leaving the starting-point on the\r\nMurrumbidgee, Sturt, on landing to inspect the country, saw before him\r\nthe lake which was indeed the termination of the Murray, but not the end\r\nthat he had dreamt of. \"For the lake was evidently so little influenced\r\nby tides that I saw at once our probable disappointment of practical\r\ncommunication between it and the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThis foreboding was realised after examination of Lake Alexandrina, as it\r\nis now called. Upon ascertaining their exact position on the southern\r\ncoast, nothing was left but to take up the weary labours of their return;\r\nthe thunder of the surf brought no hopeful message of succour, but rather\r\nwarned the lonely men to hasten back while yet some strength remained to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSturt re-entered the Murray on his homeward journey on the 13th of\r\nFebruary; and the successful accomplishment of this return is Sturt's\r\ngreatest achievement. His crew were indeed picked men, but what other\r\nAustralian leader of exploration could have inspired them with such a\r\ndeep sense of devotion as to carry them through their herculean task\r\nwithout one word of insubordination or reproach. \"I must tell the Captain\r\nto-morrow that I can pull no more,\" was the utmost that Sturt heard once,\r\nwhen they thought him asleep; but when the morrow came the speaker\r\nstubbornly pulled on.\r\n\r\nThree of these men, it must be remembered, were convicts; yet, despite\r\ntheir heroic conduct, one only (Clayton) received a free pardon on their\r\nreturn, though Sturt did his utmost to win fuller recognition of their\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nIn such a work of generalisation as this, space will not permit of a\r\ndetailed account of the return voyage, but on the 20th of March they\r\nreached the camp on the Murrumbidgee from which they had started. The\r\nrelief party were not there, and there was nothing left but to toil on,\r\nthough the men were falling asleep at the oars, and the river itself rose\r\nand raged madly against them. When they reached a point within ninety\r\nmiles of the depot where Sturt expected the relief party to be, they\r\nlanded, and two men -- Hopkinson and Mulholland -- went forward on foot\r\nfor succour. They were now almost utterly without food, and had to wait\r\nsix dragging days before men arrived with drays and stores to their aid.\r\n\r\nOne little item let me add; the boat being no longer serviceable, was\r\nburnt, Sturt giving as a reason that he was reluctant to leave her like a\r\nlog on the water. What a priceless relic that boat would now have become!\r\n\r\nSturt received but scant appreciation on his return from this heroic\r\njourney. His eyesight was impaired and his health was failing; but\r\ninstead of obtaining much-needed rest, he was sent to Norfolk Island,\r\nwith a detachment of his regiment. There the moist climate still further\r\nprejudiced his health, though he was able to quell a mutiny of the\r\nconvicts, and to save Norfolk Island from falling into their hands.\r\nGovernor Darling too proposed that Sturt should be sent as British\r\nResident to New Zealand, but filled with the love of continental\r\nexploration, he would not leave Australia, to the satisfaction of the\r\nfossils of the Colonial Office, who did not know of him, and promptly\r\nappointed Busby. Even Sir G. Murray, after whom the river had been named,\r\nhad never heard of the river.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 or a little later, the temporary loss of the sight of one eye\r\nforced him to go to England on leave, when he also bade adieu to his\r\nregiment, which was ordered to India.\r\n\r\nWhile in England, he published the first of his maps and books, but his\r\neyesight totally failing him, he retired from the army, July, 1833.\r\nSturt's eyesight, although never the same as before, was gradually\r\nrestored to him, and on September the 21st, 1834, he was married at Dover\r\nto Charlotte Greene.\r\n\r\nWe must now take leave of this distinguished man, until he reappears in\r\nthese pages as an explorer of Central Australia.*\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. SIR THOMAS MITCHELL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Sir Thomas Mitchell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7.1. INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nMitchell, whose name both as explorer and Surveyor-General looms large in\r\nour history, was born at Craigend, Stirlingshire, in 1792. He was the son\r\nof John Mitchell of Grangemouth, and his mother was a daughter of\r\nAlexander Milne of Carron Works. When he was but sixteen, young Mitchell\r\njoined the army of the Peninsula as a volunteer. Three years later he\r\nreceived a commission in the 95th Regiment or Rifle Brigade. He was\r\nemployed on the Quartermaster General's staff at military sketching; and\r\nhe was present in the field at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, the\r\nPyrenees, and St. Sebastian. After the close of the war he went to Spain\r\nand Portugal to survey the battlefields. He received promotion to a\r\nLieutenancy in 1813. He served in the 2nd, 54th, and 97th Regiments of\r\nfoot, and was promoted to be Captain in 1822, and Major in 1826. His\r\nappointment as Surveyor-General of New South Wales, as successor to John\r\nOxley, took place in 1827, when he at once assumed office, and started\r\nenergetically to lay out and construct roads, then the urgent need of the\r\nnew colony.\r\n\r\nHis strong personality, and the energy and thoroughness he displayed in\r\nall his undertakings, combined with his many gifts as draughtsman,\r\nsurveyor and organizer, proved to be of peculiar service to the colony at\r\nthat period of its existence. There was a vast unknown country\r\nsurrounding the settled parts, awaiting both discovery and development,\r\nand Mitchell's inclinations and talents being strongly directed towards\r\ngeographical discovery, the office of Surveyor-General that he held for\r\nso long was the most appropriate and advantageous appointment that could\r\nhave been given him in the interests of the colony.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Major Mitchell had faults which have always detracted\r\nfrom the estimation in which he would otherwise be held for his undoubted\r\ncapabilities. His domineering temper led him into acts of injustice, and\r\noften made it impossible for him to allow the judgments of others to\r\ninfluence his opinions. In his view, no other explorer but himself ever\r\nachieved anything worthy of commendation or propounded any credible\r\ntheory regarding the interior of Australia. He always referred\r\nslightingly to Sturt, Cunningham, and Leichhardt, and his perversity on\r\nthe subject of the junction of the Darling and the Murray drew even from\r\nthe gentle Sturt a richly-deserved and unanswerable retort. On his second\r\nexpedition, which was supposed to establish the identity of the Darling\r\nwith the junction seen by Sturt, Mitchell excused himself from further\r\nexploration of the lower Darling as he expressed himself satisfied that\r\nSturt's supposition was justified. But later, when on his expedition to\r\nwhat is now the State of Victoria, he again fell into a doubting mood,\r\nand he was not finally convinced until he had re-visited the junction.\r\nThis constant doubting at last roused Sturt, who speaking in 1848 of\r\nMitchell's work, said: \"In due time he came to the disputed junction\r\nwhich he tells us he recognised from its resemblance to a drawing of it\r\nin my first work. As I have since been on the spot, I am sorry to say\r\nthat it is not at all like the place, because it obliges me to reject the\r\nonly praise Sir Thomas Mitchell ever gave me.\"\r\n\r\nSturt's original sketch of the junction had been lost, and Sturt, who was\r\nnearly blind at the time of publication, obtained the assistance of a\r\nfriend, who drew it from his verbal description.\r\n\r\n7.2. THE UPPER DARLING.\r\n\r\nRumours of a mysterious river called the Kindur, which was said, on no\r\nbetter authority than a runaway convict's, to pursue a north-west course\r\nthrough Australia, now began to be noised about. This convict, whose name\r\nwas Clarke, but who was generally known as the Barber, said that he had\r\ntaken to the bush in the neighbourhood of the Liverpool Plains, and had\r\nfollowed down a river which the natives called the Gnamoi. He crossed it\r\nand came next to the Kindur. This he followed down for four hundred miles\r\nbefore he came upon the junction of the two. The union of the two formed\r\na broad navigable river, which he still followed, although he had lost\r\nhis reckoning, and did not know whether he had travelled five hundred or\r\nfive thousand miles. One thing, however, he was convinced of, and that\r\nwas that he had never travelled south of west. He asserted that he had a\r\ngood view of the sea, from the mouth of this most desirable river, and\r\nhad seen a large island from which, so the natives reported, there came\r\ncopper-coloured men in large canoes to take away scented wood. The Kindur\r\nran through immense plains, and past a burning mountain. As no one had\r\ninvited him to stay in this delectable country, he had returned.\r\n\r\nThe story, which bore every evidence of having been invented to save his\r\nback, received a certain amount of credence, and Sir Patrick Lindesay,\r\nthen Acting-Governor, gave the Surveyor-General instructions to\r\ninvestigate the truth of it. It was in this way that Mitchell's first\r\nexpedition originated.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, 1831, Mitchell left Liverpool Plains and reached\r\nthe Namoi on the 16th December. He crossed it and penetrated some\r\ndistance into a range which he named the Nundawar Range. He then turned\r\nback to the Namoi, and set up some canvas boats which he had brought to\r\nassist him in following the river down. The boats were of no use for the\r\npurpose, one of them getting snagged immediately, and it was clear that\r\nit would be easier to follow the river on land. As the range was not easy\r\nof ascent, he worked his way round the end of it and came on to the lower\r\ncourse of Cunningham's Gwydir, which he followed down for eighty miles.\r\nAt this point he turned north and suddenly came to the largest river he\r\nhad yet seen. Mitchell, ever on the alert to bestow native names on\r\ngeographical features -- a most praiseworthy trait in his character, and\r\nthrough the absence of which in most other explorers, Australian\r\nnomenclature lacks distinction and often euphony -- enquired of the name\r\nfrom the natives, and found it to be called the Karaula. Was this, or was\r\nthis not the nebulous Kindur? The answer could be supplied only by\r\ntracing its course; but its general direction and the discovery and\r\nrecognition of its junction with the Gwydir showed that the Karaula was\r\nbut the upper flow of Sturt's Darling. Much disappointed, for Mitchell\r\nwas intent upon the discovery of a new river system having a northerly\r\noutflow, he prepared to make a bold push into the interior. Before he\r\nstarted, Finch, his assistant-surveyor arrived hurriedly on the scene\r\nwith a tale of death. Finch had been bringing up supplies, and during his\r\ntemporary absence his camp had been attacked by the natives, the cattle\r\ndispersed, the supplies carried off, and two of the teamsters murdered.\r\nAll ideas of further penetration into the new country had to be\r\nabandoned. Mitchell was compelled to hasten back, bury the bodies of the\r\nvictims, and after an ineffective quest for the murderers, return to the\r\nsettled districts.\r\n\r\nThe journey, however, had not been without good results. Knowledge of the\r\nDarling had been considerably extended, and it was now shown to be the\r\nstream receiving the outflow of the rivers whose higher courses\r\nCunningham had discovered. The beginning of the great river system of the\r\nDarling may be said to have been thus placed among proven data. Mitchell\r\nhimself afterwards showed himself an untiring and zealous worker in\r\nsolving the identity of the many ramifications of this system.\r\n\r\n7.3. THE PASSAGE OF THE DARLING.\r\n\r\nHis next journey was undertaken to confirm the fact of the union of the\r\nDarling and the Murray. Sturt himself was fully convinced that he had\r\nseen the junction of the two rivers when on his long boat voyage; but he\r\nhad not converted every one, and Mitchell, with a large party was\r\ndespatched to settle the question and make a systematic survey. Early in\r\nMarch, 1833, the expedition left Parramatta to proceed by easy stages to\r\nthe head of the Bogan River, which had been partly traversed the year\r\nbefore by surveyor Dixon. It was during this expedition that Richard\r\nCunningham, brother of Allan, was murdered by the natives. He had not\r\nbeen long in Australia, and had been appointed botanist to the\r\nexpedition. On the morning of April 17th, he lost sight of the party,\r\nwhilst pursuing some scientific quest, and as the main body were then\r\npushing hurriedly over a dry stage to the Bogan River, he was not\r\nimmediately missed. Not having any bush experience, he lost himself, and\r\nwas never seen again. A long and painful search followed, but owing to\r\nsome mischance, Cunningham's tracks were lost on the third day, and it\r\nwas not until the 23rd of the month that they were again found. Larmer,\r\nthe assistant-surveyor, and three men were sent to follow them up until\r\nthey found the lost man. Three days later they returned, having come\r\nacross only the horse he had ridden, dead, with the saddle and bridle\r\nstill on. Mitchell personally conducted the further search. Cunningham's\r\ntracks were again picked up, and his wandering and erratic footsteps\r\ntraced to the Bogan, where some blacks stated that they had seen the\r\nwhite man's tracks in the bed of the river, and that he had gone west\r\nwith the Myalls, or wild blacks.*\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] Lieutenant Zouch, of the Mounted Police, subsequently found\r\nthe site of his death, and recovered a few bones, a Manilla hat, and\r\nportions of a coat. The account afterwards given by the natives was to\r\nthe effect that the white man came to them and they gave him food, and he\r\ncamped with them: but that during the night he repeatedly got up, and\r\nthis roused their fears and suspicions, so that they determined to\r\ndestroy him. One struck him on the back of the head with a nulla-nulla,\r\nwhen the others rushed in and finished the deadly work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. A Chief of the Bogan River Tribe. Photo by the Reverend\r\nJ.M. Curran.]\r\n\r\nAs is often the case with men lost in the bush, the unfortunate botanist,\r\nby wandering on confusing and contradictory courses, had rendered the\r\nwork of the search party more tedious and difficult, thus sealing his own\r\nfate. A rude stone memorial has since been erected on the spot, and a\r\ntablet put up in the St. Andrew's Scots Church, Sydney. The death of\r\nCunningham, who was a young and ardent man with the promise of a\r\nbrilliant future caused Mitchell much distress of mind. He did all he\r\ncould to find his lost comrade, and jeopardised the success of the\r\nexpedition by the long delay of fourteen days.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his journey by easy stages down the Bogan, and on the 25th of\r\nMay came to the Darling. This river was at once recognised by all who had\r\nbeen with him on his former trip as identical with the Karaula as\r\nMitchell had supposed; but he found the country in a different condition\r\nfrom that presented by it when Sturt and Hume first discovered the river\r\nat nearly the same place. The water was now fresh and sweet to drink, and\r\nthe flats and banks luxuriant with grass and herbage.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a site for a camp, where the town of Bourke now stands,\r\nMitchell erected a stockade of logs, which he named Fort Bourke, after\r\nthe Governor. The country on either side of the Darling was now alive\r\nwith natives, and though a sort of armed truce was kept up, it was at the\r\ncost of constant care and watchfulness, and the tactful submission to\r\nnumerous annoyances, including much petty pilfering. The boats proved to\r\nbe of no service, and after Mitchell with a small party had made a short\r\nexcursion down the river to the farthest limit of Sturt and Hume in 1829,\r\nwhere he saw the tree then marked by Hume, H.H., he had the camp\r\ndismantled, and started with the whole party to follow the river down to\r\nits junction with the Murray.\r\n\r\nBy the 11th of July, one month after leaving Fort Bourke, they had traced\r\nthe river for three hundred miles through a country of level monotony\r\nunbroken by any tributary rivers or creeks of the least importance.\r\nMitchell was now certain from the steadfast direction the river\r\nmaintained, and the short distance that now intervened between the lowest\r\npoint they had reached and Sturt's junction, that Sturt had really been\r\ncorrect in his surmise, and that he had witnessed the meeting of the\r\nrivers on that memorable occasion. He therefore decided that to keep on\r\nwas but needlessly endangering the lives of his men. He was constantly\r\nkept in a state of anxiety for the safety of any member of the party\r\nwhose duty compelled him to separate from the main body, for the natives,\r\nwho had become doubly bold through familiarity, were now persistently\r\nencroaching and rapidly assuming a defiant manner.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that Mitchell had made up his mind to retreat, the long\r\nthreatened rupture took place. Mitchell refers to the blacks of this\r\nregion as the most unfavourable specimens of aborigine that he had yet\r\nseen, barbarously and implacably hostile, and shamelessly dishonest. On\r\nthe morning of July 11th, two of the men were engaged at the river, and\r\nfive of the bullock-drivers were collecting their cattle. One of the\r\nnatives, nick-named King Peter by the men, tried to snatch a kettle from\r\nthe hand of the man who was carrying it, and on this action being\r\nresented, he struck the man with a nulla-nulla, stretching him senseless.\r\nHis companion shot King Peter in the groin, and his majesty tumbled into\r\nthe river and swam across. The swarm of natives who were constantly\r\nloitering around the camp gathered together and advanced in an armed\r\ncrowd, threatening the men, who fired two shots in self-defence, one of\r\nwhich accidentally wounded a woman. Alarmed by the shots, three men from\r\nthe camp came to the assistance of their mates, and one native was shot\r\njust when he was about to spear a man. The blacks now drew back a little,\r\nand the men seized the opportunity to warn the bullock-drivers, whom they\r\nfound occupied in lifting a bullock that had fallen into a bog. Their\r\narrival probably saved their lives, as the bullock drivers were unarmed.\r\nNo further attack took place, but the strictest watch had to be kept\r\nuntil the party was ready to begin the return journey or to beat a\r\nretreat as the natives regarded it. They reached Fort Bourke without\r\nfurther molestation, the aborigines being content with having driven away\r\nthe whites, who retraced their steps from Fort Bourke to Bathurst.\r\n\r\nThe geographical knowledge gained on this journey consisted mainly in the\r\nconfirmation of tentative theories -- the identity of the Karaula with\r\nthe Darling, and the uninterrupted course of the latter river southwards,\r\nas Major Mitchell himself had to confess, into the Murray. Furthermore it\r\nseemed now satisfactorily settled that all the inland rivers as yet\r\ndiscovered found the same common embouchure. Mitchell's experience too\r\nproved that the pastoral country through which the Darling ran was by no\r\nmeans unfit for habitation, nor was the river a salt one; true some of\r\nhis men had noticed that the water was brackish in places, but this\r\nbrackishness, it was seen, had a purely local origin.\r\n\r\nMitchell was a keen observer of the habits and customs of the aborigines.\r\nHe was remarkably quick at detecting tribal differences and distinctions,\r\nand his records of his intercourse with them -- which occupies so much of\r\nhis journals -- were most interesting then, when little had been written\r\non the subject; and are even more valuable now, as a first-hand account\r\nby an intelligent man and a practised observer of the appearance of the\r\nnatives at the time of earliest contact with the white man.\r\n\r\n7.4. AUSTRALIA FELIX.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that the fact of the union of the Darling and the\r\nMurray was now sufficiently well-established; but the official mind\r\ndeemed otherwise. When the Surveyor-General's next expedition started in\r\nMarch, 1836, he was informed that the survey of the Darling was to be\r\ncompleted without any delay; that, having returned to the point where his\r\nlast journey had come to an end, he was to trace the river right into the\r\nMurray -- see the waters of the two mingle in fact -- then to cross over\r\nthe Murray and follow up the southern bank, recrossing, and regaining the\r\nsettled districts at Yass Plains. Although the primary object of the\r\nexpedition was the verification of previous discoveries, the programme\r\nwas largely departed from, and this particular journey of Mitchell's led\r\nto the opening up and speedy settlement of what is now the State of\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nA drought, long-continued and severe, was in full force when Mitchell\r\ncommenced his preparations for departure; consequently bullocks and\r\nhorses in suitable condition were hard to obtain. But as the Government\r\nspared no expense, the necessary animals were at last available. Though\r\nupon reaching Bathurst Mitchell was informed that the Lachlan River was\r\ndry, he started on his third exploring expedition in the best of spirits.\r\nHis mind overflowed with old memories and associations, and he wrote in\r\nhis journal that this was the anniversary of the day \"when he marched\r\ndown the glacis of St. Elvas to the tune of St. Patrick's Day in the\r\nMorning, as the sun rose over the beleaguered towers of Badajoz.\" He had\r\nheard that the aborigines of the lower Murray had been informed of his\r\napproach, and that they had assured the other tribes that they were\r\ngathering murry coolah -- very angry -- to meet him, but this to one of\r\nthe Major's temper, lent but an added zest to the journey; for there were\r\nold scores to settle on both sides. It was the 17th of March, 1836,\r\nbefore he got free of the cattle stations and found himself at the point\r\nwhere Oxley had finally left the river. He noticed that throughout this\r\nroute, in spite of the dry weather, the cattle were all in good\r\ncondition; and he found Oxley's swamps and marshes transmuted into grassy\r\nflats. In fact, so changed was the face of the land, that even the\r\nlandmarks of that explorer could scarcely be recognised.\r\n\r\nAgain his mind began to be troubled with doubts as to whether he had not\r\nacknowledged the veracity of Sturt's judgment too hastily, for we find in\r\nhis journal that he again wavered, after professing that the identity\r\nadmitted of little doubt. Now, on the Lachlan, he reverted to his old\r\nidea that the Darling drained a separate and independent basin of its\r\nown. He wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I considered it necessary to ascertain, if possible, and before the\r\nheavy part of our equipage moved further forward, whether the Lachlan\r\nactually joined the Murrumbidgee near the point where Mr. Oxley saw its\r\nwaters covering the face of the country, or whether it pursued a course\r\nso much more to the westward as to have been mistaken for the Darling by\r\nCaptain Sturt.\"\r\n\r\nImpelled by this doubt he undertook a long excursion to the westward with\r\nno result but the discomfort of several thirsty nights and an unchanging\r\noutlook across a level expanse of country bounded by an unbroken horizon.\r\nHe reached Oxley's furthest on the 5th of May, but did not find that\r\nexplorer's marked tree, though he found others marked by Oxley's party\r\nwith the date 1817.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May, he halted on the bank of the Murrumbidgee, which in\r\nhis opinion surpassed all the other Australian rivers he had yet seen. As\r\nhis orders were simply to clear up the last hazy doubts that wrapped the\r\nMurray and Darling junction, and then to visit the southern bank of the\r\nMurray, he did not take his heavy baggage on to the Darling, but formed a\r\nstationary camp on the Murrumbidgee, and thence went on with a small\r\nparty. When they came to the Murray, they found their old enemies awatch\r\nfor them. It was afterwards ascertained that many of these aborigines had\r\ntravelled as far as two hundred miles to assist in chasing back the white\r\nintruders once more from their violated hunting-grounds. But these braves\r\nof the Darling did not yet understand the nature of the man they sought\r\nto intimidate.\r\n\r\nAt first a nominal peace prevailed, and for two days the blacks followed\r\nthe expedition closely, seeking to cut off any stragglers, and rendered\r\nthe out-roving work of minding and collecting the cattle and horses one\r\nof considerable risk. Mitchell was soon convinced that a sharp lesson was\r\nnecessary to save his men. In the event of losing any of his party, he\r\nwould have had to fight his way back with the warriors of what seemed a\r\nthickly-populated district arrayed against him. One morning, therefore,\r\nthe party was divided, and half of them sent back to an ambush in the\r\nscrub. The natives were allowed to pass on in close pursuit of the\r\nadvance party. The native dogs, however, scented this ambuscade, and,\r\nafter their fashion, warned the blacks of the presence of the hidden\r\nwhites. As they halted, and began handling and poising their spears, one\r\nof the ambushed men fired without orders, and the others followed his\r\nexample. The natives faltered, and those in advance, hearing the firing,\r\nrushed back eager to join in the fray. The conflict was short and\r\ndecisive; the over-confident fighting men of the Darling lost seven of\r\ntheir number and were driven ignominiously back into the Murray scrub and\r\nacross that river. Henceforth the explorers were unmolested. These\r\npugnacious aboriginals were the same that had threatened to bring Sturt's\r\nboat voyage to a tragical conclusion, and soon after Mitchell's\r\nexploration, they waged a determined war against the early overlanders\r\nand their stock.\r\n\r\nMitchell's way to the Darling was now clear, and on the 31st of May he\r\ncame upon that river, a short distance above the confluence. Tracing the\r\nstream upwards, he again convinced himself that it was the same river\r\nthat he had been on before, and, satisfied of this, he turned and\r\nproceeded right down to the junction itself, and finally disposed of one\r\nof the most interesting problems in Australian exploration.\r\n\r\nHe naturally felt much anxiety, after his late skirmish, for the safety\r\nof the stationary camp he had left behind, and having lost no time during\r\nhis return, he was relieved to find his camp in quiet and safety.\r\n\r\nThe Surveyor-General first mapped the exact junction of the Murrumbidgee\r\nand Murray, and then transferred the whole of the expedition in boats to\r\nthe other side of the Murray. Thus was commenced the investigation of the\r\nunexplored side of the Murray, that above its junction with the\r\nMurrumbidgee, in other words the Hume proper. On the 30th of June the\r\nparty camped at Swan Hill, having found the country traversed to exceed\r\nexpectations in every way. This pleasing state of affairs continued and\r\nMitchell journeyed on without check or hindrance. After finding the\r\nLoddon River on the 8th of July, and the Avoca on the 10th, he altered\r\nhis preconceived plan to follow the main river up, and, drawn by the\r\nbeauty and pastoral advantages of this new territory, he struck off to\r\nthe south-west in order to examine it in detail, and trace its\r\ndevelopment southwards.\r\n\r\nMore and more convinced that he had found the garden of Australia -- he\r\nafterwards named this region Australia Felix -- Mitchell kept steadily on\r\nuntil he came to the Wimmera, that deceptive river which afterwards\r\nnearly lured Eyre to a death of thirst. On the last day of July he\r\ndiscovered the beautiful Glenelg, and launched his boat on its waters. At\r\nthe outset he was stopped by a fall, was compelled to take to the land\r\nonce more, and proceeded along the bank, occasionally crossing to examine\r\nthe other side. On the 18th the boats were again used, the river being\r\nmuch broader, and in two days he reached the coast, a little to the east\r\nof Cape Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThe whole expedition then moved homewards, and reached Portland Bay,\r\nwhere they found that the Henty family from Van Diemen's Land had been\r\nestablished on a farm for about two years. From them Mitchell received\r\nsome assistance in the way of necessary supplies, and then resumed his\r\njourney for home. On the 19th the party separated; Mitchell pushed ahead,\r\nleaving Stapylton, his second, to rest the tired animals for a while and\r\nthen to follow slowly. On his homeward way Mitchell ascended Mount\r\nMacedon, and from the summit saw and identified Port Phillip. His return,\r\nwith his glowing report of the splendid country he had discovered --\r\ncountry fitted for the immediate occupation of the grazier and the farmer\r\n-- at once stimulated its settlement, and as the man whose explorations\r\nwere of immediate benefit to the community in general -- Mitchell's name\r\nstands first on the roll of explorers.\r\n\r\n7.5. DISCOVERY OF THE BARCOO.\r\n\r\nSome years elapsed before Mitchell -- now Sir Thomas -- again took to the\r\nfield of active exploration. The settlement of the upper Darling and the\r\nDarling Downs had caused numerous speculations as to the nature of the\r\nunknown territory comprising the northern half of Australia. In 1841,\r\ncommunications had passed between the Governor and Captain Sturt, and in\r\nDecember of the same year Eyre, not long returned from his march round\r\nthe Great Bight, wrote offering his services, provided that no prior\r\nclaim had been advanced by Sturt. Governor Gipps asked for an estimate of\r\nthe expenses, but considered Eyre's estimate of five thousand pounds too\r\nhigh, and nothing further was done. In 1843, Sir Thomas Mitchell\r\nsubmitted a plan of exploration to the Governor, who consulted the\r\nLegislative Council. The Council approved it and voted one thousand\r\npounds towards expenses. The Governor referred the matter to Lord\r\nStanley, whose reply was favourable, but the project still hung fire. In\r\n1844 Eyre again wrote offering to make the journey at a much more\r\nreasonable rate, but his offer was however declined as Mitchell's\r\nproposals held the field. In 1845 the fund was increased to two thousand\r\npounds, and Sir George Gipps ordered the Surveyor-General to make his\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nMitchell favoured the search for a practicable road to the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria, and hoped also that he would at last find his long-sought\r\nnorthern-flowing river. In a letter which he then received from a\r\nwell-known grazier, Walter Bagot, there is mention of an aboriginal\r\ndescription of a large river running northward to the west of the\r\nDarling. But as natives in their descriptions frequently confuse flowing\r\nto and flowing from, they probably had Cooper's Creek in mind.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of the year, Commissioner Mitchell, the son of\r\nSir Thomas, who was afterwards drowned during a passage to Newcastle, had\r\nmade a flying survey towards the Darling, and the discovery of the\r\nNarran, Balonne, and Culgoa rivers has been attributed to him.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December, 1845, Mitchell started from Buree with a very\r\nlarge company, including E.B. Kennedy as second in command, and W.\r\nStephenson as surgeon and collector. He struck the Darling much higher\r\nthan Fort Bourke, and it was not until he was across the river that he\r\npassed the outermost cattle-stations, which had sprung rapidly into\r\nexistence since his last visit to the neighbourhood. The Narran was then\r\nfollowed up until the Balonne was reached. This river, in his superlative\r\nstyle, Mitchell pronounced to be the finest in Australia, with the\r\nexception of the Murray. He then struck and followed the Culgoa upwards\r\nuntil it divided into two branches; he skirted the main one, which\r\nretained the name of the Balonne. On the 12th of April he came to the\r\nnatural bridge of rocks which he called St. George's bridge, and which is\r\nthe site of the present town of St. George. Here a temporary camp was\r\nformed; Kennedy was left in charge to bring the main body on more slowly;\r\nMitchell with a few men went ahead. He followed up the Balonne to the\r\nMaranoa, but as the little he saw of that tributary did not tempt him to\r\nfurther investigation of it, he kept on his course up the main stream\r\nuntil he reached the junction of a stream which he named the Cogoon. This\r\nriverlet led him on into a magnificent pastoral district, in the midst of\r\nwhich stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. It is in his\r\ndescription of this region in his journal that we first find an allusion\r\nto the bottle tree.\r\n\r\nThe party wandered on over a low watershed and came down out on to a\r\nriver which, from its direction and position, he surmised to be the\r\nMaranoa, the stream he had not followed. At this new point it was full of\r\ndeep reaches of water, and drained a tract of most pleasing land. On its\r\nbanks he determined to await Kennedy's arrival.\r\n\r\nKennedy overtook him on the 1st of June, bringing from Sir Thomas's son\r\nRoderick despatches which had reached the party after the leader's\r\ndeparture. Amongst other items of news in the despatches was the report\r\nof Leichhardt's return, and of the hearty reception that he had been\r\naccorded in Sydney. One piece of random information, a mere floating\r\nnewspaper surmise, but enough to arouse Mitchell's suspicious temper,\r\nannoyed him greatly. \"We understand,\" it ran, \"the intrepid Dr.\r\nLeichhardt is about to start another expedition to the Gulf, keeping to\r\nthe westward of the coast ranges.\"\r\n\r\nAs this seemed to indicate an intention of trespassing on Mitchell's\r\npresent field of operations, he naturally felt some resentment not likely\r\nto be allayed by such a paragraph as the following: \"Australia Felix and\r\nthe discoveries of Sir Thomas Mitchell now dwindle into comparative\r\ninsignificance.\"\r\n\r\nAgain leaving Kennedy, he set out to make a very extended excursion.\r\nTraversing the country from the head of the Maranoa, he discovered the\r\nWarrego River. Keeping north, over the watershed, for a time he fondly\r\nimagined that he had reached northward-flowing waters; but the direction\r\nof the rivers that he found, the Claude and the Nogoa, soon convinced him\r\nof his error, and that he was on rivers of the east coast. Even when he\r\nhad reached the Belyando, a river which he named and followed down for a\r\nshort distance, he still deluded himself that he had reached inland\r\nwaters. Intensely mortified at finding that he was on a tributary of the\r\nBurdekin, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he\r\nreturned to the head of the Nogoa, once more subdivided his party, and\r\nformed a stationary camp to await his return from a westward trip.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, he was blessed with the most splendid success. He\r\nfound the Barcoo, a river that seemed to him to promise all he sought\r\nfor. The direction of its upper course easily led him to believe that it\r\nwas an affluent of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and after tracing it for some\r\ndistance he returned to camp. The newly-discovered river he named the\r\nVictoria, thinking it would prove to be the same as that found by Captain\r\nStokes on his survey expedition. It was on the Barcoo, or Victoria, that\r\nMitchell first noticed the now famous grass that bears his name. On their\r\nreturn journey, they followed down the Maranoa, and at the old camp at\r\nSt. George's Bridge, they were told by the natives that white men had\r\nvisited the place during their long absence. It was a singular and\r\nwelcome feature of Mitchell's discoveries that they had always proved to\r\nbe adjacent to civilisation, and to be suitable for immediate occupation.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Barcoo was the last feather in the cap of the\r\nSurveyor-General. He was doomed to learn soon that it was not the river\r\nof his dreams, but only the head waters of that central stream discovered\r\nby Sturt, Cooper's Creek; but meanwhile the delusion must have been very\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Mitchell was sent out to report on the Bathurst goldfields, and\r\non a subsequent visit to England he took with him the first specimen of\r\ngold and the first diamond found in Australia. He was for a short time\r\none of the members for the Port Phillip electorate, but resigned, as he\r\nfound faithful discharge of the duties to be incompatible with his\r\noffice. He patented the boomerang screw propeller, and was the author of\r\nmany educational and other works, including a translation of the Lusiad\r\nof Camoens. Although a strict martinet in his official duties, and\r\nsubject to a choleric temper, he was strenuous in his devotion to the\r\nadvancement of Australia, among whose makers he must always occupy a\r\nproud position. He died on the 5th of October, 1855, at Carthona, his\r\nprivate residence at Darling Point, Sydney, New South Wales. His wife was\r\na daughter of Colonel Blount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. THE EARLY FORTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.1. ANGAS McMILLAN AND GIPPSLAND.\r\n\r\nAngas McMillan, who was the discoverer of what is now so widely-known as\r\nGippsland, in Victoria, was a manager of the Currawang station, in the\r\nManeroo district. On the 20th of May, 1839, he started from the station\r\non a trip to the southward to look for new grazing land. He had with him\r\nbut one black boy, named Jimmy Gibbu, who claimed to be the chief of the\r\nManeroo tribe, so that if the party was small, it was very select. On the\r\nfifth day McMillan got through to the country watered by the Buchan\r\nRiver, and, from the summit of an elevation which he called Mount\r\nHaystack, he obtained a most satisfactory view over the surrounding\r\nregion. The next night, McMillan, awakened by a noise, found Jimmy Gibbu\r\nbending over him with a nulla-nulla in his hand. Fortunately, McMillan's\r\npistol was within easy reach, and, presenting it at Jimmy's head, he\r\ncompelled him to drop the nulla-nulla, and to account for his suspicious\r\nattitude. Jimmy confessed to a fear of the Warrigals, or wild blacks of\r\nthat region, to acute home-sickness, and to a general unwillingness to\r\nproceed further.\r\n\r\nMcMillan examined the country he had found, and having judged it to be\r\nvery desirable pastoral land, he returned home. He then formed a new\r\nstation for Mr. Macalister on some country he had found on the Tambo\r\nRiver, and went himself on another trip of discovery. This time he had\r\nfour companions with him, two friends named Cameron and Matthews, a\r\nstockman, and a black boy. they followed the Tambo River down its course\r\nthrough fine grazing country, both plains and forest, until in due course\r\nit led them to the point of its embouchure in the lakes of the south\r\ncoast. He named Lake Victoria, and then directed his course to the west,\r\nwhere he discovered and named the Nicholson and Mitchell rivers. He was\r\nso deeply impressed with the resemblance of the country he had just been\r\nover to some parts of Scotland, that he called the district by the now\r\nobsolete name of Caledonia Australis. On January the 23rd, 1840, he was\r\nout again and discovered and named the Macalister River, and pushed on as\r\nfar west as the La Trobe River. This addition of rich pastoral regions to\r\nthe already settled districts was altogether due to Angas McMillan's\r\nenergy, and is now known as Gippsland, being named officially after Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps, the Governor who had the amusing eccentricity of insisting\r\nthat all the towns laid out during his term of office should have no\r\npublic squares included within their boundaries, being convinced that\r\npublic squares encouraged the spread of democracy.\r\n\r\n8.2. COUNT STRZELECKI.\r\n\r\nCount Strzelecki's expedition through Gippsland with the discovery of\r\nwhich district he is commonly and wrongly credited, was due to the\r\nliterary and geographical work he had undertaken, as he was gathering\r\nmaterial for his well-known work, The Physical Description of New South\r\nWales, Victoria, and Van Diemen's Land. He ascended the south-east\r\nportion of the main dividing range, and named the highest peak thereof\r\nKosciusko, after a fancied resemblance in its outline to that Polish\r\npatriot's tomb at Cracow.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of March, 1840, he reached the cattle station on the Tambo\r\nwhither McMillan had just returned, and was directed by him on to his\r\nnewly-discovered country. Strzelecki pushed through to Western Port,\r\nmeeting with some scrubby and almost inaccessible country during the last\r\nstages of his journey. His party had to abandon both horses and packs,\r\nand fight its way through a dense undergrowth on a scanty ration of one\r\nbiscuit and a slice of bacon per day, varied with an occasional native\r\nbear. It was here that the Count, who was an athletic man, found that his\r\nhardy constitution stood the party in good stead. So weakened and\r\nexhausted were his companions, that it was only by constant encouragement\r\nthat he urged them along at all. When forcing their way through the\r\nmatted growth of scrub, he often threw himself bodily upon it, breaking a\r\npath for his weary followers by the mere weight of his body. It was in a\r\nwretched condition that they at last reached Western Port.\r\n\r\n8.3. PATRICK LESLIE.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Patrick Leslie, who has always been considered the father of\r\nsettlement on the Darling Downs, started with stock from a New England\r\nstation, then the most northerly settled district in New South Wales, and\r\nformed the first station on the Condamine River, actually before that\r\nriver had been identified as a tributary of the Darling. There was a\r\ngeneral impression that the Condamine flowed north and east, and finally\r\nfound its way through the main range to the Pacific. In 1841, Stuart\r\nRussell, who closely followed Leslie as a pioneer, followed the river\r\ndown for more than a hundred miles to the westward, and in the following\r\nyear it was traced still further, and the Darling generally accepted as\r\nits final destination.\r\n\r\n8.4. LUDWIG LEICHHARDT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Ludwig Leichhardt.]\r\n\r\nLeichhardt is the Franklin of Australia, around whose name has ever clung\r\na tantalising veil of mystery and romance. Truth to tell, his claim as a\r\nleading explorer rests solely on his first and undoubtedly fruitful\r\nexpedition. But for his mysterious fate mention of his name would not\r\nstir the hearts of men as it does. Had he returned from his final venture\r\nbeaten, it must have been to live through the remainder of his life a\r\ndisappointed and embittered man. Far better for one of his temperament to\r\nrest in the wilderness, his grave unknown, but his memory revered.\r\n\r\nLeichhardt was born at Beskow, near Berlin, and studied at Berlin.\r\nThrough an oversight he was omitted from the list of those liable to the\r\none year of military service, and the sweets of exemption tempted him to\r\nevade the three-year military course. The consequence was that he was\r\nprosecuted as a deserter, and sentenced in contumaciam. Afterwards,\r\nAlexander von Humboldt succeeded, by describing his services to science\r\non his first expedition in Australia, in obtaining a pardon from the\r\nKing. By a Cabinet Order, Leichhardt received permission to return to\r\nPrussia unpunished. When the order arrived in Australia, he had already\r\nstarted on his last expedition.\r\n\r\nDr. Leichhardt appears to have been a man whose character, to judge from\r\nhis short career, was largely composed of contradictions and\r\ninconsistencies. Eager for personal distinction, with high and noble\r\naims, he yet lacked that ready sympathy and feeling of comradeship that\r\nattract men. Leichhardt's followers never desired to accompany him on a\r\nsecond expedition. Yet strange to say, he was capable of inspiring firm\r\nfriendship in such men as William Nicholson and Lieutenant Robert Lynd.\r\n\r\nWhen he left on his first exploring expedition, on which he was\r\nsuccessful owing to the luck of the novice, people generally predicted --\r\nand with much reason -- that he would fail. But when he set out on his\r\nsecond and disastrous journey, universally applauded and with his name on\r\neverybody's lips, it was never doubted but that he would succeed.\r\n\r\n[Map. Leichhardt's Route 1844 and 1845, Mitchell's Route 1845 and 1846,\r\nand Kennedy's Route 1847 and 1848]\r\n\r\nOn his first expedition he was insufficiently equipped, had but\r\ninexperienced men with him, and was a bad bushman himself. In fact the\r\njournal of the trip reads to a man accustomed to bush life like the fable\r\nof The Babes in the Wood; yet he managed to blunder through. On his\r\nsecond expedition he was amply provided, and most of his companions were\r\nexperienced men, but it proved a miserable fiasco.\r\n\r\nHis great confidence in himself led him to ignore or undervalue the fact,\r\npatent to others, that he was no bushman either by instinct or training.\r\nAnd he seemed to prefer for companions men like himself, who could not\r\ndetect this failing, as is evident from a letter written by him to W.\r\nHull, of Melbourne, with reference to a young man who was anxious to join\r\nhis party. In this letter he enumerates the qualities that he considers\r\nnecessary in a follower:--\r\n\r\n\"Activity, good humour, sound moral principle, elasticity of mind and\r\nbody, and perfect willingness to obey my orders, even though given\r\nharshly...I have been extremely unfortunate in the choice of my former\r\ncompanions.\"\r\n\r\nThe last remark is an unworthy one, and of course applies to the\r\ncompanions of his second expedition. He does not include a knowledge of\r\nopen-air life amongst his qualifications, nor the needful bushmanship;\r\nand apparently in Leichhardt's opinion, a useless man of good moral\r\nprinciple would be as acceptable to an explorer as a good bushman of\r\ndoubtful morality. It causes one to inquire whether the devoted men who\r\ntoiled for Sturt, private soldiers and prisoners of the Crown, were men\r\nof sound moral principle? This extract affords an insight into\r\nLeichhardt's failures. He wanted only those men who would blindly and\r\nignorantly obey and believe in him. For a man of Leichhardt's\r\ntemperament, such men were not to be found: he had missed the fairy gift\r\nat birth -- all the essentials of good leadership.\r\n\r\nStuart Russell, in his Genesis of Queensland, cites his shrewd old\r\nstockman's opinion of Dr. Leichhardt, as he was just before his first\r\ntrip. The station from which Leichhardt started on that occasion was near\r\nRussell's, so that the man spoke from personal knowledge: \"It's my belief\r\nthat if Dr. Leichhardt do it at all, 'twill be more by good luck than\r\nmanagement. Why, sir, he hasn't got the knack of some of us; why it comes\r\nlike mother's milk to some. I can't tell how or why, but it does. Mark my\r\nwords, sir, Dr. Leichhardt hasn't got it in him, and never will have.\"\r\n\r\nTwo invaluable qualities in an explorer, apart from his scientific\r\nattainments, Leichhardt possessed. These were courage and determination;\r\nnecessary no doubt, but not sufficient in themselves to carry through an\r\nexpedition to success. He lacked tact, and was deficient in practical\r\nknowledge of the bush, and especially in what is known as bushmanship.\r\nOne fixed idea of his was, that in dry country if one can only keep on\r\nfar enough one is bound to come to water: a theory plausible enough if it\r\ncould be carried out to its logical conclusion; but the application of\r\nwhich often involves a physical impossibility. And it must be taken into\r\nconsideration that Leichhardt had never travelled in the dry country of\r\nthe interior, but that what small experience he possessed had been gained\r\non the fairly well-watered coast. He asserts in his journal that cattle\r\nand horses trust entirely to the sense of vision for finding water, and\r\nnot to the sense of smell. The exact reverse is of course the case.\r\n\r\nThe character of the lost explorer will thus be seen to have militated\r\nstrongly against his success when he came to be pitted against the -- to\r\nhim -- unknown dangers of a dry season in the far interior. But his fatal\r\nself-confidence led him to challenge the desert, thinking that he must\r\nsucceed where better men had been denied even the hope of success. When\r\nhis last expedition comes to be reviewed, a more detailed discussion of\r\nthe probabilities of a successful issue to it will be made. Poor\r\nLeichhardt, with all his moods and caprices, it would have been strange\r\nif he had not shown some appreciation of humour. Let us quote his\r\ndescription of his sudden and unexpected arrival in Sydney, after the\r\nPort Essington expedition.\r\n\r\n\"We did come to Sydney, it was quite dark; we did go ashore, and then I\r\nthought to see my dear friend Lynd. So I went up George Street to the\r\nbarracks. And then I went to his quarters to his window. He was dressing\r\nhimself; I did put in my head; he did jump out of the other window and I\r\nstood there wondering. Soon many people did come round, and did look, Oh\r\nso timid. I did not know all. And there was such a greeting. I was dead,\r\nand was alive again. I was lost, and was found.\"\r\n\r\nBut in thus reviewing Leichhardt's aptitude -- or rather inaptitude --\r\nfor the work, and commenting upon his shortcomings, we must do him the\r\nfullest justice by paying homage to the sincerity of his belief in\r\nhimself and his mission. In that belief he was honestly loyal. His\r\nconception of his duty was of the highest, and in its interest he would,\r\nand did, make every sacrifice in his power. If some prescient tongue\r\ncould have told Leichhardt that the end of his quest would be an unknown\r\ndeath, he would have accepted the fate without a murmur, provided his\r\ndeath benefited geographical discovery.\r\n\r\nAs the man of science in a party under a capable leader, Leichhardt would\r\nhave achieved greater success than many men who have filled that\r\nposition; as the leader himself he was, of necessity, an absolute\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nLeichhardt arrived in New South Wales in 1842, and after some botanical\r\nexcursions about the Hunter River district, he travelled overland to\r\nMoreton Bay, and there occupied himself with short expeditions in the\r\nneighbourhood, pursuing his favourite study of physical science. When the\r\nsubject of the exploration of the north was mooted, he was desirous of\r\nsecuring the position of naturalist, but the delay in forming the\r\nprojected expedition disappointed him, and he resolved to try and\r\norganise a private one. In this he received very little encouragement. He\r\npersevered, however, and eking out his own resources by means of private\r\ncontributions, both in money and stock, he managed to get a party\r\ntogether. On the 1st of October, 1844, he left Jimbour station on the\r\nDarling Downs, on the trip that was destined to make his name as an\r\nexplorer. His preparations were on a much smaller scale than Mitchell's.\r\nConsidering the importance of the undertaking, his party was absurdly\r\nsmall. He had with him six white and two black men, seventeen horses,\r\nsixteen head of cattle and four kangaroo dogs; and his supply of\r\nprovisions was equally meagre. His plan of starting from Moreton Bay to\r\nPort Essington differed considerably from Mitchell's proposed journey to\r\nthe Gulf from Fort Bourke, but although longer and more roundabout, it\r\nwould be a safer route for his little party to adopt, as they would keep\r\nto the comparatively well-watered coastal lands. Leaving the Condamine,\r\nhe crossed the northern watershed, and struck the head of one of the main\r\ntributaries of the Fitzroy River, which he named the Dawson. Thence he\r\npassed westward into a region of fine pastoral country, which he named\r\nthe Peak Downs. Here he named the minor waters of the Planet and the\r\nComet, and Zamia Creek. On the 10th of January, 1845, he found the\r\nMackenzie River, and thence crossed on to and named the Isaacs, a\r\ntributary of the Fitzroy coming from the north. This river they followed\r\nup till they crossed the watershed on to the head waters of the Suttor\r\nRiver. They followed this stream down until it brought them to the\r\nBurdekin, Leichhardt's most important discovery.\r\n\r\nUp the valley of this river they travelled, until they reached the head,\r\nwhere, at the Valley of Lagoons, they crossed the watershed on to the\r\nwaters of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Here, for some unknown reason,\r\nLeichhardt went far too much to the north, which necessitated a long\r\ndetour around the south-eastern corner of the Gulf. It was while they\r\nwere retracing a southern course along the eastern shore of the Gulf that\r\nthe naturalist Gilbert met his fate. Up to this time they had been so\r\nlittle troubled with the natives that they had ceased almost to think of\r\na possible hostile encounter with them. This fancied immunity was broken\r\nin a most tragic manner on the night of the 28th of June, 1845. It was a\r\ncalm, quiet evening, and the party were peacefully encamped beside a\r\nchain of shallow lagoons. The doctor was thinking out his plans for the\r\nnext few days, Gilbert was planting a few lilies he had gathered, as was\r\nhis nightly habit when any flowers were available. Roper and the others\r\nwere grouped around the fire warding off the attacks of the mosquitoes.\r\nSuddenly about seven o'clock a shower of spears was thrown among the\r\nunarmed men, and Gilbert was almost instantly killed, Roper and Calvert\r\nbeing seriously wounded. The whites rushed for their guns, but\r\nunfortunately not one weapon was ready capped, and it was some time\r\nbefore any of them could be discharged, when a volley caused the blacks\r\nto scamper off. It is most astonishing that the whole of the members of\r\nthe party were not cut down in one dreadful massacre.\r\n\r\nThe body of the murdered naturalist was buried at the fatal camp, but the\r\ngrave was left unmarked, and a large fire built and consumed above it to\r\nhide all traces of it from the natives. The river where this sad mishap\r\noccurred now bears the name of Gilbert.\r\n\r\nFrom the scene of this tragedy, which ordinary precautions would have\r\navoided, the party proceeded around the southern shore of the Gulf,\r\nkeeping a short distance above tidal waters; but their progress was slow\r\nand painful on account of the two wounded men. Most of Leichhardt's names\r\nare still retained for the rivers of the Gulf which he crossed, the\r\nLeichhardt itself being an exception. This river he mistook for the\r\nAlbert, so named by Captain Stokes during his marine survey of the north\r\ncoast. A.C. Gregory rectified the error in after years, and gave the\r\nriver the name of the lost explorer for whom he was then searching. With\r\nfast-dwindling supplies, lagging footsteps, and depressed spirits, the\r\nexpedition travelled slowly on to the south-west corner of the Gulf\r\nwhere, in crossing a large river, the Roper, four of the horses were\r\ndrowned in consequence of the boggy banks. This misfortune so limited\r\ntheir means of carriage that Leichhardt had to sacrifice the whole of his\r\nbotanical collection. On the 17th of December, 1845, the worn-out\r\ntravellers, nearly destitute of everything, reached the settlement of\r\nVictoria, at Port Essington, and the long journey of fourteen months was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThis expedition, successful as it was in opening up such a large area of\r\nwell-watered country, attracted universal attention both to the\r\ngratifying economic results and to the hitherto untried leader. He was\r\nenthusiastically welcomed back to Sydney, and dubbed by journalists the\r\nprince of explorers. But what captivated public fancy was a certain halo\r\nof romance that clung to the journey on account of the reported death of\r\nLeichhardt, a report that gained general credence. His unexpected return\r\ninvested him with a romance which -- fortunately for his reputation --\r\nthe total and absolute disappearance of himself and company in 1848 has\r\nbut the more richly coloured. Enthusiastic poets gush forth in song, and\r\na more substantial reward was raised by public and private subscriptions\r\nand shared among the expedition in due proportions.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these encomiums on his success, and perhaps a little\r\nintoxicated by the general acclamation, Leichhardt now conceived the\r\nambitious idea of traversing the continent from the eastern to the\r\nwestern shore; keeping as far as possible on the same parallel of\r\nlatitude. This was a bold project, coming as it did so soon after Sturt\r\nhad returned to Adelaide from his excursion into the interior with a\r\nterrible tale of thirst and suffering. But this time the hero of the hour\r\nexperienced no difficulty in obtaining funds and other necessary aids.\r\nThe party, when organised, travelled from the Hunter River to the\r\nCondamine, taking with them their outfit of mules, cattle, and goats.\r\nWhen the expedition departed from Darling Downs, they numbered seven\r\nwhite men and two natives, with 270 goats, 180 sheep, 40 bullocks, 15\r\nhorses, and 13 mules. There were besides an ample outfit and provisions\r\ncalculated to last the explorers on a two years' journey; for it was\r\nestimated that the expedition would be absent from civilisation for that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nInstead of setting out westwards from the initial point in a direction\r\nwhere Leichhardt could reasonably expect fair travelling country for some\r\ndistance, he proceeded along his old track north to the Mackenzie and\r\nIsaacs Rivers. What induced him to adopt this course is uncertain. He\r\nexplained to one of his party that it was to verify some former\r\nobservations; or he may have had some dim notion that by keeping to the\r\ntropical line he would gain some climatic assistance. Whatever the cause,\r\nthe result was disastrous. The wet season and monsoonal rains caught the\r\nparty amongst the sickly acacia scrubs of that region; and hemmed in by\r\nmud and bog they lost their stock, consumed their provisions, and made no\r\nprogress. Henceforth the narrative is one of semi-starvation, varied by\r\ngorging on the days when a beast was killed; and wrangles and quarrels,\r\nin which the leader appeared in no amiable light. Medicine had been\r\nomitted from the stores, and all the covering they had from the\r\ntorrential rains was provided by two miserable calico tents. The 6th day\r\nof July found them back on Chauvel's station on the Condamine; a sad\r\ncontrast to the party which had aspired to cross the continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. John Frederick Mann. Born 1819, died September 7th, 1907,\r\nat Sydney. The last survivor of a Leichhardt expedition.]\r\n\r\nThe onus of this wretched failure Leichhardt tried to cast upon his\r\ncompanions, upon whom he made many unjust aspersions. J.F. Mann, late of\r\nthe Survey Department of New South Wales, was one of the expedition, and\r\nthe last surviving member of any expedition connected with Leichhardt. He\r\nwrote a booklet in which he vigorously defends his comrades and himself\r\nagainst the unworthy slurs cast at them by Leichhardt. Amongst his papers\r\nis a rough sketch from life of Leichhardt in bush costume.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Condamine, Leichhardt was put into possession of the news\r\nof Mitchell's return and of the discovery of the Barcoo. Being anxious to\r\nexamine the country lying between the upper Condamine and Mitchell's\r\nlatest track, he, in company with two or three of his late companions,\r\nleft Cecil Plains for that purpose; he went as far as the Balonne River,\r\ncrossed it and returned. This doubtless was in view of organising another\r\nexpedition, with which he evidently intended to start in another manner,\r\nstraight to the westward.\r\n\r\nStill persisting and believing in his capability of leading an expedition\r\nacross the continent, and fearful that this ambitious project might be\r\nforestalled, he now made strong and strenuous efforts to organise another\r\nparty. He succeeded at length, but the party was neither so well\r\nprovided, nor so large, nor composed of such capable men as the second.\r\n\r\nIn fact, very little is known of the members that composed it; the only\r\nthing certain is that it was not at all adapted for the work that lay\r\nbefore it. A few words of the Reverend W.W.B. Clarke, the well-known\r\ngeologist, have been many times quoted, and they convey about all that is\r\nknown of the personnel of the expedition:--\r\n\r\n\"The parties that accompanied Leichhardt were perhaps little capable of\r\nshifting for themselves in case of any accident to their leader. The\r\nsecond in command, a brother-in-law of Leichhardt, came from Germany to\r\njoin him before starting, and he told me, when I asked him what his\r\nqualifications for the journey were, that he had been at sea and had\r\nsuffered shipwrecks, and was therefore well able to endure hardship. I do\r\nnot know what his other qualifications were.\"\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is very pregnant, and implies that a very poor opinion\r\nof the men as experienced bushmen was entertained by those who saw them.\r\n\r\nThe lost expedition is supposed to have consisted of six whites and two\r\nblacks; the names known being those of the doctor himself, Classen,\r\nHentig, Stuart, and Kelly. He had with him 12 horses, 13 mules, 50\r\nbullocks, and 270 goats; beside the utterly inadequate allowance of 800\r\npounds of flour, 120 pounds of tea, some sugar and salt, 250 pounds of\r\nshot, and 40 pounds of powder. His last letter is dated the 3rd of April,\r\n1848, from McPherson's station on the Cogoon, but in it he speaks only of\r\nthe country he has passed through, and nothing of his intended route.\r\nSince the residents of this then outlying station lost sight of him, no\r\nsure clue as to the fate of him and his companions has ever come to\r\nlight. The total evanishment, not alone of the men, but of the animals --\r\nespecially the mules and the goats -- is one of the strangest mysteries\r\nof our mysterious interior. Thirst probably caused the death of the\r\nanimals, and in that case they would have died singly and apart, and\r\ntheir remains would in after years elude attention. A similar fate\r\nprobably befel the men.\r\n\r\nRumour has always been rife as to the locality of Leichhardt's death, and\r\nsuggestions the most hopelessly unlikely and inconsistent have been put\r\nforward and seriously considered. At the same time, the only two reliable\r\nmarks, undoubtedly genuine and fitting in in every way with Leichhardt's\r\nprojected course of travel, have been neglected.\r\n\r\nLeichhardt started from McPherson's station on the Cogoon, now perhaps\r\nbetter known as Muckadilla Creek. There was a rumour, never\r\nauthenticated, that after he had proceeded nearly one hundred miles he\r\nsent back a man with a report that he had passed through some splendid\r\npastoral land, but this is not at all likely to be true. The first\r\nindication of him is then met with on the Barcoo (Victoria) whereon A.C.\r\nGregory, in charge of the Leichhardt Search Expedition, in 1858, found\r\nhis marked tree and other indications:--\r\n\r\n\"Continuing our route along the river (latitude 24 degrees 35 minutes;\r\nlongitude 36 degrees 6 minutes), we discovered a Moreton Bay ash, about\r\ntwo feet in diameter, marked with the letter L on the east side, cut\r\nthrough the bark about four feet from the ground, and near it the stumps\r\nof some small trees that had been cut with a sharp axe, also a deep notch\r\ncut in the side of a sloping tree, apparently to support the ridge-pole\r\nof a tent, or some similar purpose; all indicating that a camp had been\r\nestablished here by Leichhardt's party. No traces of stock could be\r\nfound; this however is easily accounted for, as the country had been\r\ninundated last season.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt about the authenticity of the trace, and it at\r\nonce does away with the truth of the stories told to Hovenden Hely by the\r\nblacks as to Leichhardt's murder on the Warrego River. Gregory then went\r\nup the Thomson River but found no other mark, and returning followed that\r\nriver and Cooper's Creek down to South Australia. This camp of\r\nLeichhardt's is easily understood. Then follows an account of the other\r\nfound by the same explorer in 1856, during an earlier expedition. This\r\nwas on the upper waters of Elsey Creek, and his description of it runs as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"The smoke of bush fires was visible to the south, east, and north, and\r\nseveral trees cut with iron axes were noticed near the camp. There were\r\nalso the remains of a hut, and the ashes of a large fire, indicating that\r\nthere had been a party encamped there for several weeks; several trees\r\nfrom six to eight inches in diameter had been cut down with iron axes in\r\nfair condition, and the hut built by cutting notches in standing trees\r\nand resting a large pole therein for a ridge. This hut had been burnt\r\napparently by the subsequent bush fires; and only some pieces of the\r\nthickest timber remained unconsumed. Search was made for marked trees,\r\nbut none were found, nor were there any fragments of iron, leather, or\r\nother material of the equipment of an exploring party, or of any bones of\r\nanimals other than those common to Australia. Had an exploring party been\r\ndestroyed there, there would most likely be some indications, and it may\r\ntherefore be inferred that the party proceeded on its journey. It could\r\nnot have been a camp of Leichhardt's in 1845, as it is 100 miles\r\nsouth-west of his route to Port Essington, and it was only six or seven\r\nyears old, judging by the growth of the trees; having subsequently seen\r\nsome of Leichhardt's camps on the Burdekin, Mackenzie, and Barcoo Rivers,\r\na great similarity was observed in the mode of building the hut, and its\r\nrelative position with regard to the fire and water supply, and the\r\nposition with regard to the great features of the country was exactly\r\nwhere a party going westward would first receive a check from the\r\nwaterless tableland between the Roper and Victoria Rivers, and would\r\nprobably camp and reconnoitre before attempting to cross to the\r\nnorth-west coast.\"\r\n\r\nLeichhardt's track, as far as the Elsey, seems tolerably plain and\r\nentirely in accordance with the character of the man and his intentions.\r\nForced to retreat from the dry country west of the Thomson, he probably\r\nfollowed that river to its head, and crossing the main watershed regained\r\nand re-pursued his track of 1845, as far as the Roper, of which river\r\nElsey Creek is a tributary. When he left the camp seen by Gregory, he\r\nwould, going either south-west or west, find himself in the driest of dry\r\ncountry, which is even now but sparsely settled. And there came the end.\r\n\r\nLong before the last water they carried with them had been used, their\r\nbeasts would have all died, left here and there wherever they fell. So\r\ntoo would the men. Differences of opinion would have arisen, and some\r\nwould have been for turning back, and others for keeping on. Some would\r\nhave persisted in changing the direction they were following, and, led on\r\nby some mad delirious fancy in seeing water indications in some rock or\r\nbush, would have separated and staggered on to die alone. Their baggage\r\nwould have been left strewn over the desert where it had been abandoned,\r\nand the men, one by one, would have shared the same fate. Into such a\r\nwaterless and barren region the blacks would seldom penetrate, and what\r\nwith the sun, hot winds, bush fires, and sand-storms, all recognisable\r\ntraces would soon have been effaced.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the notched tree to support a ridge-pole, which feature\r\nwas noticed by Gregory in both camps, J.F. Mann, of whose companionship\r\nwith Leichhardt mention has already been made, often stated that he would\r\nrecognise Leichhardt's camps anywhere by this singular device for\r\nsupporting the ridge of a tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. EDMUND B. KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Edmund B. Kennedy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9.1. THE VICTORIA AND COOPER'S CREEK.\r\n\r\nE.B. Kennedy, whose tragic death ineffaceably branded the Cape York\r\nblacks as remorselessly cruel, came to Australia early in life, and was\r\nappointed a Government surveyor in 1840. His first experience as an\r\nexplorer was gained when as Assistant-Surveyor and second in command he\r\naccompanied his chief on the last expedition that Mitchell led into the\r\ninterior. On this occasion he remained in charge of the camp formed at\r\nSt. George's Bridge, and then conducted part of the expedition on to the\r\nMaranoa, where he rejoined the Major, and remained in charge whilst\r\nMitchell made his exploration westward.\r\n\r\nOn Mitchell's return to Sydney, there being some doubt as to the point of\r\noutflow of the newly-discovered Victoria River, Kennedy was sent out with\r\na small party to follow the river down and ascertain its course and\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, he reached Mitchell's lowest camp on the Victoria\r\nRiver, and started to trace the river down. During the first day's\r\njourney he came across some natives, from one of whom he learnt that the\r\naboriginal name of the river was the Barcoo. Two days afterwards he\r\nobserved with some anxiety that the trend of the valley was inclining\r\nfrom northwards towards the point whence Sturt had turned back from his\r\nupward course on Cooper's Creek. As the second part of his instructions\r\nwas to find a practicable road to the Gulf, he feared that he would not\r\nhave sufficient provisions to fulfil both duties. He therefore made a\r\nstationary camp, and with two men proceeded down the river. But after two\r\ndays' journey, he found that the Barcoo turned to the west, and even\r\nnorth of west. The channel now showed large reaches of water within its\r\nconfines, some of them more than one hundred yards in width. This induced\r\nhim to alter his plan, and he thought he should follow such an important\r\nwatercourse and ascertain its outflow. He therefore turned back for the\r\nremainder of his party. On the 30th of August he discovered a large river\r\ncoming from the North-North-East, and he named it the Thomson. With the\r\nusual inconsistency of Australian inland rivers, the Thomson soon\r\npresented another and different scene. The great pastoral stretches of\r\nthe upper course were left behind, and were succeeded by flat and\r\ninferior country intersected by sand-ridges. The course of the river\r\nitself once more turned to the southward, and was but scantily watered.\r\nStill Kennedy persevered until convinced that further progress must bring\r\nhim to Sturt's furthest on Cooper's Creek. The face of the land answered\r\nto Sturt's description; and grass and feed both beginning to fail him,\r\nKennedy had to consider whether it was worth while risking the lives of\r\nhis men to confirm what was practically a certainty. At last vistas of\r\nthe desert, described by Sturt with such terrible fidelity, appeared\r\nstretching away to the horizon, and Kennedy turned back, satisfied that\r\nthe Victoria River and Cooper's Creek were one and the same stream.\r\n\r\nIt was now Kennedy's intention to make an excursion towards the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria. On his way down, in order to travel lighter, he had buried a\r\nlarge quantity of flour and sugar as well as his drays. When he arrived\r\nat the cache of provisions on his way back, he found that the natives had\r\ndug the rations up, and in mere wantonness had so mixed and scattered\r\nthem as to render them useless. A little further on, he was just in time\r\nto save the carts, for an aboriginal was probing in the ground with a\r\nspear to ascertain their whereabouts. During this excursion Kennedy\r\nnoticed that the blacks were given to \"chewing tobacco in a green state;\"\r\nbut the \"tobacco\" was, of course, the pituri plant, which they are\r\naccustomed to masticate. By the time he reached the head of the Warrego,\r\nKennedy was too short of provisions to attempt his projected Gulf\r\nexpedition, and had to make homeward, but resolved to go down by that\r\nriver and ascertain whether it joined the Darling or flowed westward.\r\n\r\nThe Warrego dividing into many dry channels when they reached its lower\r\ncourses, the party struck eastward to the Culgoa, and reached that river\r\nafter a very distressing stage over dry country on which they lost six\r\nhorses from heat and thirst, whilst bringing the carts across it.\r\n\r\n9.2. A TRAGIC EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nKennedy's first experience of an independent exploring expedition in the\r\nwest was by no means a fitting prelude to the tragic journey he next\r\nundertook. The same impulse that led to Mitchell's and Leichhardt's\r\nnorthern journeys stimulated Kennedy to make his dangerous journey up the\r\neastern coast of the long peninsula that terminates in Cape York -- the\r\ndesire to find a road to the north coast, so that an easy chain of\r\ncommunication should exist between the southern settlements and the far\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of the month of May that Kennedy landed at Rockingham\r\nBay with his party of twelve men. He had started from Sydney in the\r\nbarque Tam o' Shanter, which was convoyed by Captain Owen Stanley in the\r\nAlligator. This was in 1848, the same fateful year that witnessed\r\nLeichhardt's disappearance. A schooner was to meet the party on the\r\nnorth, at Port Albany, where it was proposed to form a settlement should\r\nthe features of the peninsula warrant such an enterprise. In actual point\r\nof distance the task was not great, being a land traverse of from three\r\nto four hundred miles, allowing for deviations. But never were men in\r\nAustralia so dogged by disaster and beset by danger as were Kennedy and\r\nhis followers. Opposed by country as yet unfamiliar to them, they found\r\ntheir onward path hindered by many totally unforeseen conditions. Ranges\r\nand ravines clothed with an almost impenetrable jungle, which was\r\ninfested with the venomous leaves of the stinging tree and the hooked\r\nspikes of the lawyer vine, confronted them. The land was densely\r\npopulated with the most savage and relentless natives on the continent,\r\nwho resented the invasion from the outset. Death tracked them steadily\r\nthroughout, and claimed ten out of the thirteen of the devoted party as\r\nhis victims.\r\n\r\nThe country through which their course lay is now dotted with\r\nmining-fields and townships, and fertile spaces of tilled tropical\r\nplantations. The coast-line rich in harbours is the busy haunt of\r\nsteamers, and the narrow waterway between the mainland and the great\r\nbarrier reef the home of many lightships. But when Kennedy and his party\r\nmade their pioneer journey, the great desolation of the wilderness beset\r\nthem on every side from the land, whilst the sea off-shore held myriad\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nKennedy landed from the Tam o'Shanter at the little point that still\r\nbears the jovial name, and bade farewell to Owen Stanley in good spirits,\r\nand with no dread premonitions. He was fresh from the sun-scorched plains\r\nof the interior, and would confidently confront whatever might lie before\r\nhim. Scrub and swampy country delayed him on his way to the higher land\r\nat the foot of the range, where he had hoped to find better travelling\r\ncountry; but the foothills were serried with ravines and gullies, and the\r\nsides clothed with the ever-present jungle. The horses and sheep,\r\nunaccustomed to the sour grasses of the coast lands of northern\r\nAustralia, pined and rapidly wasted away. Their troubles were augmented\r\nby acts of annoyance, and on one unfortunate occasion, of open hostility\r\non the part of the blacks.\r\n\r\nBy the 18th of July, a little over six weeks after they had left\r\nRockingham Bay, the sheep had been reduced from one hundred to fifty, and\r\nthe horses began to fail so rapidly that they had to abandon the carts,\r\nwhile the men were becoming completely exhausted from the endless cutting\r\nand hacking of the scrub. At length they surmounted the range, the\r\nbackbone of the peninsula, and on the western slope, amid the heads of\r\nthe rivers flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria, made better progress.\r\nKennedy, however, adhered to his instructions to examine the eastern\r\nslope, and recrossed the watershed, where troubles again came thick upon\r\nhim. One after another the horses began to give in, and owing to the\r\nstorekeeper's mismanagement, they were nearly out of provisions. On the\r\n9th of December they reached Weymouth Bay, and Kennedy determined to form\r\na stationary camp, and leaving there the main body of his men, push\r\nforward to Port Albany, whence he would send back the schooner that was\r\nawaiting them with relief. He selected seven men whom he left in charge\r\nof Carron, the naturalist, and with three men and the heroic Jacky-Jacky,\r\nan aboriginal of New South Wales, he pushed on -- to his death.\r\n\r\nBefore the departure the last sheep was slaughtered, and its lean and\r\nmiserable carcase shared between the two parties; and with Carron,\r\nKennedy ascended a hill that commanded a prospect of the country lying to\r\nthe north, but could see nothing but rugged hills and black scrub. He\r\nconfided only to Carron his gloomy foreboding that he would never reach\r\nAlbany, so disheartened were both the men by the prospect. And throughout\r\nthose long weeks of starvation that ensued, Carron refrained from\r\ncrushing all hope in his comrades by communicating to them Kennedy's\r\ndespair of relief.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks Kennedy struggled on, cutting his path through the scrub,\r\nand, with dwindling strength, clambering across the spurs of the range.\r\nFor the story of his struggles and eventual death Australia has had to\r\nrely on the report of the only survivor, the faithful Jacky-Jacky. They\r\nreached Shelburne Bay, where one of the men accidentally shot himself,\r\nand became so weak from loss of blood that it was impossible for him to\r\nmove. As another man, Luff, was sick, Kennedy left the third man, Dunn,\r\nto attend to his two comrades, and pushed on alone with the native boy.\r\nHe had actually gained the Escape River, within sight of Albany Island,\r\nwhen his fate overtook him, and, surrounded by the blood-thirsty foes who\r\nhad so long and persistently hung upon his footsteps, he fell at last\r\nbeneath their spears.\r\n\r\nThe story is best told in Jacky's own words, although it has been often\r\nrepeated. They had come across some natives whom Kennedy was inclined to\r\ntrust, but of whom Jacky was suspicious, and that night they camped in\r\nthe scrub, foodless and fireless.\r\n\r\n\"I and Mr. Kennedy,\" said Jacky, \"watched them that night, taking it in\r\nturns every hour that night. By and by I saw the blackfellows. It was a\r\nmoonlight night, and I walked up to Mr. Kennedy and said: 'There is\r\nplenty of blackfellows now;' this was in the middle of the night. Mr.\r\nKennedy told me to get my gun ready.\r\n\r\n\"The blacks did not know where we slept, as we did not make a fire. We\r\nboth sat up all night. After this daylight came and I fetched the horses\r\nand saddled them. Then we went a good way up the river, and then we sat\r\ndown a little while, and then we saw three blackfellows coming along our\r\ntrack, and then they saw us, and one ran back, as hard as he could run,\r\nand fetched up plenty more, like a flock of sheep almost. I told Mr.\r\nKennedy to put the saddles on the horses and go on, and the blacks came\r\nup and they followed us all day. All along it was raining. I now told him\r\nto leave the horses and come on without them, that horses made too much\r\ntrack. Mr. Kennedy was too weak, and would not leave the horses. We went\r\non this day until the evening; raining hard and the blacks followed us\r\nall day, some behind, some planted before. In fact, blackfellows all\r\nround following us. Now we went into a little bit of scrub, and I told\r\nMr. Kennedy to look behind always. Sometimes he would do so, and\r\nsometimes he would not do so to look out for the blacks. Then a good many\r\nblackfellows came behind in the scrub and threw plenty of spears, and hit\r\nMr. Kennedy in the back first. Mr. Kennedy said to me: 'Oh Jacky! Jacky!\r\nshoot 'em! shoot 'em!' then I pulled out my gun and fired and hit one\r\nfellow all over the face with buck-shot. He tumbled down and got up again\r\nand again, and wheeled right round, and two blacks picked him up and\r\ncarried him away. They went a little way and came back again, throwing\r\nspears all round, more than they did before -- very large spears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Wild Blacks of Cape York signalling.]\r\n\r\n\"I pulled out the spear at once from Mr. Kennedy's back, and cut the jag\r\nwith Mr. Kennedy's knife. Then Mr. Kennedy got his gun and snapped, but\r\nthe gun would not go off. The blacks sneaked all around by the trees, and\r\nspeared Mr. Kennedy again, in the right leg above the knee a little, and\r\nI got speared in the eye, and the blacks were now throwing always, never\r\ngiving over, and shortly again speared Mr. Kennedy again in the right\r\nside. There were large jags in the spears, and I cut them off and put\r\nthem in my pocket. At the same time we got speared the horses got speared\r\ntoo, and jumped and bucked about and got into the swamps. I now told Mr.\r\nKennedy to sit down while I looked after the saddle-bags, which I did,\r\nand when I came back again I saw the blacks along with Mr. Kennedy. I\r\nthen asked him if he saw the blacks with him. He was stupid with the\r\nspear wounds, and said 'No'; I then asked him where was his watch? I saw\r\nthe blacks taking away watch and hat as I was returning to Mr. Kennedy.\r\nThen I carried Mr. Kennedy into the scrub. He said, 'Don't carry me a\r\ngood way.' Then Mr. Kennedy looked this way, very bad (Jacky rolling his\r\neyes). I asked him often, 'are you well now?' and he said -- 'I don't\r\ncare for the spear wound in my leg, Jacky, but for the other two spear\r\nwounds in my side and back, and I am bad inside, Jacky!' I told him\r\nblackfellow always die when he got spear wound in there (the back). He\r\nsaid: 'I am out of wind, Jacky.' I asked him: 'Are you going to leave\r\nme?' And he said, 'Yes, my boy; I am going to leave you; I am very bad,\r\nJacky, you take the books, Jacky, to the Captain, but not the big ones;\r\nthe Governor will give you anything for them.' I then tied up the papers.\r\nHe then said: 'Jacky, give me paper and I will write.' I gave him pencil\r\nand paper, and he tried to write, and he then fell back and died, and I\r\ncaught him in my arms and held him; and I then turned round myself and\r\ncried. I was crying a good while until I got well; that was about an\r\nhour, and then I buried him.\r\n\r\n\"I digged up the ground with a tomahawk, and covered him over with logs\r\nand grass, and my shirt and trousers. That night I left him near dark. I\r\nwould go through the scrub and the blacks threw spears at me; a great\r\nmany; and I went back into the scrub. Then I went down the creek which\r\nruns into Escape River, and I walked along the water in the creek, very\r\neasy, with my head only above the water, to avoid the blacks, and get out\r\nof their way. In this way I went half-a-mile. Then I got out of the\r\ncreek, and got clear of them, and walked all night nearly, and slept in\r\nthe bush without a fire.\"\r\n\r\nAt the southern entrance of Albany Pass, one of the most picturesque\r\nspots of the east coast of Australia, the schooner Ariel lay at anchor,\r\nawaiting, day after day, some signal to indicate the arrival of the\r\nexpected Kennedy. One day the look-out man announced that there was an\r\naboriginal on the mainland making urgent signals to the schooner. There\r\nwas nothing unusual in this, for during the delay and tedious waiting,\r\nthe blacks had constantly been seen making gestures on the shore. An\r\nexamination through the glass, however, showed the people on the Ariel\r\nthat this blackfellow was making such vehement and persistent signals\r\nthat it was thought worth while to send the boat in to investigate\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the poor fellow's signals were urgent and vehement; he was\r\nJacky-Jacky, who, thirteen days after Kennedy's death, by devious\r\ntwistings and windings, occasionally climbing a tree in the hope to catch\r\na glimpse of the schooner, and existing on roots and vermin, had at last\r\nreached the goal. But when he stood prominently on the shore to signal to\r\nthe schooner, his relentless pursuers sighted him, and his frantic signs\r\nwere for rescue from imminent peril. The boat's crew fortunately\r\nrecognised the emergency, and a smart race ensued between them and the\r\nnatives. The rescuers won, and Jacky-Jacky was saved to tell his\r\nmelancholy story.\r\n\r\nThere was no time lost on board the Ariel. There were three men who might\r\nbe still alive at Shelburne Bay, and eight more starving at Weymouth Bay.\r\nKennedy was dead; their duty, and urgent duty it was, lay with the\r\nliving. At once the schooner commenced to beat down the coast, and at\r\nShelburne Bay they landed but failed to find the camp. But they seized a\r\nnative canoe which bore sufficient evidence that the men had been\r\nmurdered. Clearly time must not be wasted in inflicting punishment;\r\naccording to Jacky's account, the men at Weymouth Bay were absolutely\r\nstarving, if they had not already succumbed to famine.\r\n\r\nAfter their leader had left Weymouth, Carron had shifted the camp on to\r\nthe nearest hill, as it was more open and less exposed to the treacherous\r\nattacks of the natives. A flagstaff was erected on the crest, in view of\r\nthe Bay. Then the party had only to sit down and await the coming of the\r\ngrim shadow following them through the jungle to strike them with the\r\ndeath chill. They had two skeletons of horses and two gaunt dogs, and a\r\ntiny remnant of flour. The men gave themselves up to moody despondency.\r\n\"Wearied out by long endurance of trials that would have shaken the\r\ncourage and tried the fortitude of the strongest,\" says Carron in his\r\ndiary, \"a sort of sluggish indifference prevailed that prevented the\r\ndevelopment of those active energies which were necessary to support us\r\nin our present critical position.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the two horses was killed, and its scanty flesh, cut into strips,\r\nwas dried in the sun and smoke. This, the most repellant, sapless food to\r\nbe found in the world, had been their diet for some time. Douglas was the\r\nfirst to die. The survivors were still strong enough to give him burial.\r\nIn a few days Taylor followed him and was interred by his side. The\r\nblacks threatened them continually, though at times they would lay down\r\ntheir arms and bring pieces of fish and turtle into the camp; but this\r\nonly the better to spy out their weakness. Carpenter was the next to\r\nsuccumb, and on the 1st of December they were doomed to drink their\r\nbitterest cup to the dregs. They had killed the remaining horse, but the\r\nmonsoonal rains descended, and in the steamy atmosphere the meat turned\r\nputrid. Torn with anxiety, Carron was dejectedly mounting the look-out to\r\nthe flagstaff when he caught sight of a vessel beating into the Bay. The\r\nsudden change from despair to relief was overwhelming. Kennedy must have\r\nreached Port Albany, and had doubtless sent the Bramble to rescue them.\r\nWith eager, tremulous hands he hoisted a pre-arranged signal to warn them\r\nagainst the blacks. Darkness fell and they kept a fire burning, and fired\r\noff rockets, and when daylight came and a boat was lowered from the\r\nschooner, they felt no misgivings. Time passed, and Carron again ascended\r\nthe look-out. What he saw nearly blasted his eyesight. The schooner was\r\nstanding out to sea; he was just in time to see her round the point and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nThey strove to persuade themselves that it was not the Bramble, a relief\r\nschooner that was supposed to cruise along the coast. But it assuredly\r\nhad been the Bramble, and her men had not seen the signals against the\r\ngloomy background of scrub and hills. They knew nothing of Kennedy's\r\ndeath, nor of Carron's plight. The agony of this disappointment must have\r\nbeen more bitter than death. Mitchell was the next to die, and the\r\nsurvivors were too weak to give him burial. Then Niblett and Wall\r\ndeparted, but on the last day of the year relief came to the remaining\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nSome natives suddenly brought Carron a dirty note, to say that help was\r\ncoming, and he saw by their gestures that there was a vessel in the bay.\r\nHe scribbled a note in reply, but they refused to take it, and began to\r\ncrowd into the camp and handle their weapons. They were not going to be\r\nbaulked of their prey. At the very moment when they were poising their\r\nspears, the relief party arrived. Four brave men -- Captain Dobson of the\r\nAriel, Dr. Vallack, Barrett a sailor, and the eager Jacky-Jacky -- had\r\nforced their way through mangroves and hostile threatening natives to\r\nsnatch them from their doom.\r\n\r\nNothing could be carried away but the two famished men, and they were\r\nhelped down to the boat without coming into active hostilities. Thus\r\nended the most disastrous expedition in Australian annals. Kennedy's body\r\nwas never recovered, nor was the fate of the men at Shelburne Bay\r\nrevealed. The bodies at Weymouth Bay were re-buried on Albany Island, and\r\na tablet was erected in memory of Kennedy, in St. James's Church, Sydney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. LATER EXPLORATION IN THE NORTH-EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1. WALKER IN SEARCH OF BURKE AND WILLS.\r\n\r\nFrederick Walker commenced his bush career as a pioneer squatter in the\r\ndistricts of Southern Queensland, but afterwards made his residence near\r\nthe centre, where he joined the Native Police. He had long bush\r\nexperience, was a firm believer in the training of the natives in\r\nquasi-military duty, and had taken a prominent part in the formation of\r\nthe Queensland Native Police. On this relief expedition, the party was\r\ncomposed almost entirely of Native Police troopers under his leadership.\r\n\r\nOn receiving his commission, he pushed rapidly out to the Barcoo, and,\r\nnear the Thomson River, came upon another tree marked L. This might have\r\nbeen made by Leichhardt. He ascended the main watershed, and crossed it\r\ncoming down on to the head of the Flinders River. Here he experienced\r\nmany hindrances arising from the rough basaltic nature of the country\r\nthat borders the northern head-waters of that river. When he finally\r\ndebouched upon the wide western plains, he crossed the Flinders, without\r\nrecognising it as the main branch, in the search for which he went on\r\nnorthward. Approaching the Gulf of Carpentaria, he had several encounters\r\nwith the aboriginals. As he neared the coast, the bend of the Flinders\r\nbrought that river again across his route, and it was then that he came\r\non some camel tracks, which assured him that the missing party, the\r\nobject of his search, had at any rate reached the Gulf safely. On his\r\noutward way Walker may be said to have pursued a course parallel with\r\nthat of the Flinders, a little further to the northward.\r\n\r\nHe pushed on to the Albert River, to replenish his provisions at the\r\ndepot provided for the use of the various relief parties. He arrived\r\nthere safely, after having had two more skirmishes with the blacks on the\r\nway. He reported the finding of the camel tracks, and having come to the\r\nconclusion that Burke and Wills had probably made for the Queensland\r\nsettlements, he decided to follow them thither. He traced out a tributary\r\nof the Flinders, the Saxby, on his homeward route, but saw no more of the\r\ncamel tracks, and finally crossed the water-shed on to the rough basaltic\r\ncountry at the head of the Burdekin. Here his horses suffered so severely\r\nfrom the rugged nature of the country, that by the time they reached\r\nStrathalbyn, a station on the lower Burdekin, the whole of the party were\r\nwell-nigh horseless, as well as almost out of provisions.\r\n\r\nWalker was afterwards engaged by the Queensland Government to mark out a\r\ncourse for a telegraph line between Rockingham Bay and the mouth of the\r\nNorman River in Carpentaria. This work he carried out successfully; but\r\nwhen at the Gulf, he was attacked by the prevalent malarial fever, and\r\ndied there.\r\n\r\n10.2. BURDEKIN AND CAPE YORK EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of eastern Australia was now fairly well known; it had\r\nbeen crossed from south to north, and from east to west, and it was only\r\nthe elongated spur of the Cape York peninsula that stood in urgent need\r\nof detailed exploration.\r\n\r\nAmongst what may be called the minor pastoral expeditions of that period,\r\nwas one conducted by G.E. Dalrymple, who penetrated the coastal country\r\nnorth of Rockhampton as far north as the Burdekin. In 1859 he followed\r\nthat river down to the sea, and found that the mouth had been located\r\nfurther to the south than was really the case. His party then struck\r\ninland, examined the head of that river, and found the Valley of Lagoons.\r\nThe following year another party, consisting of Messrs. Cunningham,\r\nSomer, and three others, explored the tributaries of the Upper Burdekin,\r\nand opened up several good tracts of pastoral country. The permanent\r\nrunning stream which flows through a rugged wall of basalt into an\r\nana-branch of the Burdekin, was first noticed by this party, and called\r\nFletcher's Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Frank L. Jardine.\r\n\r\nIllustration. Alec W. Jardine.]\r\n\r\nFrank and Alec Jardine jointly led up the Cape York Peninsula an\r\nexpedition that in its hardships and dangers emulated that of Kennedy's,\r\nbut fortunately without a tragic ending. The year 1863 was one of great\r\nactivity in the northern part of eastern Australia. At Cape York, the\r\nImperial Government had, on the recommendation of Sir George Bowen, the\r\nfirst governor of Queensland, decided to form a settlement. John Jardine,\r\nthe police magistrate of the central town of Rockhampton, was selected to\r\ntake charge, and a detachment of marines was sent out to be stationed\r\nthere. Somerset, the new settlement, was formed on the Albany Pass,\r\nopposite to the island of the same name. Jardine was to proceed by sea to\r\nhis new sphere of office, but, anticipating the want of fresh meat at the\r\nproposed station, he entered into an arrangement with the Government\r\nwhereby his two sons were to take a small herd of cattle thither\r\noverland, and on the way make careful observations of the land through\r\nwhich they were to pass. Somerset was situated near the scene of\r\nKennedy's death, and knowing what tremendous difficulties that explorer\r\nhad met with on the eastern shore, it was decided that the expedition\r\nshould attempt to follow the western shore through the unknown country\r\nthat faced the Gulf of Carpentaria. Both the Jardine brothers were quite\r\nyoung men at the time when they started on their exceedingly adventurous\r\ntrip, which combined cattle-droving with exploration: Frank, the accepted\r\nleader, being only twenty-two years old, and his brother Alexander but\r\ntwenty. Their father had come from Applegarth, in Dumfriesshire; they had\r\nboth been born near Sydney, and had been educated by private tutors and\r\nat the Sydney Grammar School.\r\n\r\nThey took with them A.J. Richardson, a surveyor sent by the Government,\r\nScrutton, Binney, Cowderoy, and four natives. The stock consisted of\r\nforty-two horses and two hundred and fifty head of cattle. The cheerful\r\nacceptance of this hazardous enterprise by these youths was a fine\r\nindication of adventurous spirit, and reflects great credit on their\r\ncourage and the courage of the native-born. The fate of the last explorer\r\nwho dared to face the perils of the Peninsula would have deterred any but\r\nthe boldest from taking up his task.\r\n\r\nBefore the final start from Carpentaria Downs, then the furthest station\r\nto the north, supposed to be situated on Leichhardt's Lynd River, Alec\r\nJardine made a trip ahead in order to secure knowledge of an available\r\nroad for the cattle, and save delay in the earlier stages of the main\r\njourney. On this preliminary observational excursion, he followed the\r\npresumed Lynd down for nearly 180 miles, until he was convinced that\r\nneither in appearance, direction, nor position did it correspond with the\r\nriver described by Leichhardt. On the subsequent journey with the cattle,\r\nthis conviction was found to be in accordance with fact, for the stream\r\nwas then proved to be a tributary of the Gilbert, now known as the\r\nEinnesleigh.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of October the final start was made, and the party commenced\r\na journey seldom equalled in Australia for peril and adventure. The head\r\nof the Einnesleigh was amongst rough ranges, and on the 22nd of the month\r\nthey halted the cattle while they conducted another search for the\r\ninvisible Lynd. They found other good-sized creeks, but no Lynd, nor did\r\nthey ever see it. They afterwards found that, owing to an error in the\r\nmap they had with them, the Lynd was placed 30 miles out of position. A\r\nmisfortune happened at the outset of their expedition. In the morning a\r\nlarge number of horses were missing. Leaving some of the party to stay\r\nbehind and look for them, the two brothers and the remainder went on with\r\nthe cattle. On the second day they arrived at a large creek, without\r\nhaving been overtaken by the party with the missing horses and the\r\npack-horses. After an anxious day spent in waiting, Alec Jardine started\r\nback to find out the cause of the delay. He met the missing party, who\r\nwere bringing bad news with them. Through carelessness in allowing the\r\ngrass round the camp to catch fire, half of their rations and nearly the\r\nwhole of their equipment had been burnt. In addition, one of the most\r\nvaluable of their horses had been poisoned. This terrible misfortune,\r\ncoming at such an early stage of their journey when they had all the\r\nunknown country ahead of them, seriously imperilled the success of their\r\nundertaking. But there was nothing to do but to bear it with what\r\nequanimity they could muster.\r\n\r\nThe Cape York natives now seemed to rejoice that they had another party\r\nof white men to dog to death. Once about twenty of them appeared about\r\nsundown and boldly attacked the camp with showers of spears. Two days\r\nafterwards, they surprised the younger Jardine when alone, and he had to\r\nfight hard for his life. The creek they had been following down led them\r\non to the Staaten River, where the blacks succeeded in stampeding their\r\nhorses, and it was days before some of them were recovered.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of December, they left this ill-omened river, and steered due\r\nnorth. Bad luck still haunted them; tortured by flies, mosquitoes, and\r\nsand-flies, their horses scattered and rambled incessantly. While the\r\nbrothers were absent, searching one day for the horses, the party at the\r\ncamp allowed the solitary mule to stray away with its pack on. The mule\r\nwas never found again, and it carried with it, in its pack, some of their\r\nmost necessary articles, reducing them nearly to the same state of\r\ndeprivation as their determined enemies, the aboriginals. Two more horses\r\nwent mad, through drinking salt water; one died, and the other was so ill\r\nthat he had to be abandoned. On the 13th of December they reached the\r\nMitchell River, not without having had another hot battle with the\r\nblacks, who followed them day after day, watching for every opportunity\r\nand displaying the same relentless hostility that they had formerly shown\r\nto Kennedy. Whilst the party were on the Mitchell, the natives mustered\r\nin force and fell upon the explorers with the greatest determination.\r\nAfter a severe contest, in which heavy loss had been inflicted upon the\r\nsavages, they sullenly and reluctantly retired. From what was afterwards\r\ngathered from the semi-civilised natives about Somerset, these tribes\r\nfollowed the Jardines for nearly 400 miles. This perseverance and\r\ninappeasable enmity had been equalled before only by the Darling natives.\r\nIt can be imagined how these incessant attacks, combined with the\r\nharassing nature of the country, gave the party all they could do to hold\r\ntheir own, and but for the prompt and plucky manner in which the attacks\r\nwere met, not one of them would have survived.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Mitchell, steering north, they got into poor country,\r\nthinly-grassed and badly-watered, with the natives still hanging on their\r\nflanks. On the 28th of December, the blacks began to harass the horses,\r\nand another hard struggle took place. Storms of rain now set in, and they\r\nhad to travel through dismal tea-tree flats, with the constant\r\nexpectation of being caught by a flood in the low-lying country.\r\n\r\nIn January, they had a gleam of hope. On the 5th they came to a\r\nwell-grassed valley, with a fine river running through it, which they\r\nnamed the Archer. On the 9th they crossed another river, which they\r\nsupposed to be the one named the Coen on the seaward side. But once\r\nacross this river, troubles gathered thick again; the rain poured down\r\nconstantly, the country became so boggy that they could scarcely travel,\r\nand to crown all their misfortunes, two horses were drowned when crossing\r\nthe Batavia, and six others were poisoned and died there.\r\n\r\nFate seemed now to have done her worst, and the explorers faced the\r\nfuture manfully. Burying all that they could dispense with, they packed\r\nall their remaining horses and started resolutely to finish the journey\r\non foot. On the 14th two more of their horses died, and the blacks once\r\nmore came up behind to reconnoitre. As may be imagined, the whites were\r\nnot in a patient humour, and this last skirmish was brief and severe.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th two more horses died from the effects of the poison plant.\r\nFifteen only were left out of the forty-two with which they had started.\r\nThey were now approaching the narrow point of the Cape, and found\r\nthemselves on a dreary waste of barren country whereon only heath grew,\r\nand which was intersected with boggy creeks.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, they caught a glimpse of the sea from the top of\r\na tree, and on the 20th they were in full view of it. As they went on,\r\nthey were entangled in the same kind of scrub that baffled Kennedy, and\r\nat last on the 29th, after some days of scrub-cutting, it was determined\r\nto halt the cattle, whilst the brothers should push on to Somerset in the\r\nendeavour to find a more practicable track. In the tangled, scrubby\r\ncountry through which they had passed, it had been difficult to form a\r\ntrue conception of the distance, and their estimate of twenty miles for\r\nthe distance separating them from the settlement was much too short.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, the two Jardines and their most trusted black\r\nboy, Eulah, started to find the settlement. For a time they were hemmed\r\nin by a bend of what they took to be the Escape River, but on getting\r\nclear of it, they were surprised to come to another large and swollen\r\nriver, which apparently ran into the Gulf. This forced them to return.\r\nAfter a few days' rest, they made a second vain attempt. Hemmed in by\r\nimpassable morasses and impenetrable thickets, in some places they were\r\ncut off from approaching even the river, by formidable belts of\r\nmangroves. In fact, the Jardine River, as it is now called, heads almost\r\nfrom the eastern shore, from Pudding Pan Hill in fact, Kennedy's fatal\r\ncamp. It overlaps the Escape River, and after many devious windings and\r\ntwistings, flows across the Cape out on to the Gulf shore.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of February that, on the subsidence of some of\r\nthe flooded creeks, the brothers made a successful effort, and got into\r\nsomewhat better travelling country. The next morning they came across\r\nsome blacks who were eager to be on good terms, and hailed them to their\r\nsurprise with shouts of \"Franco; Allico; Tumbacco\". These cries had been\r\ntaught them by Mr. Jardine, who was getting anxious because of his sons'\r\ndelay, and had done all he could think of to help them. He had cut a\r\nmarked tree line, almost from sea to sea; and coached the local natives\r\nup in a few English words, so as to be recognised as friends. This last\r\ndevice succeeded admirably. From these newcomers, they selected three as\r\nguides, and the following day reached the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party and the stock were soon brought into Somerset,\r\nwhere a cattle-station was formed. When we look back at the difficulties\r\nthat beset the path of this expedition, and the unforseen disasters that\r\nbefel them, one cannot help feeling the greatest admiration for the\r\nleaders and their conduct. In spite of the numberless treacherous attacks\r\nof the blacks to which they had been subjected, not a member of the band\r\nhad been lost. They had fought their way through the same species of\r\ndanger that had environed the unfortunate Kennedy, and had all lived to\r\ntell the tale. The Royal Geographical Society rewarded the labours of the\r\ntwo brothers by electing them Fellows of the Society, and by awarding\r\nthem the Murchison medal.\r\n\r\nFrank Jardine was for some period Government Resident at Thursday Island,\r\nwhither the settlement has been removed; but of late he has resided at\r\nhis own station at Somerset, and engaged in pearl-shelling. Alec entered\r\nthe Queensland civil service, as Roads Engineer, and in that capacity did\r\nmuch important work in the construction of the roads of that State. In\r\n1871 and 1872, he designed and constructed the road and railway-bridge\r\nover the Dawson River, and in 1890 he became Engineer-in-Chief for\r\nHarbours and Rivers.\r\n\r\nBut the scrubby and hilly nature of the country on Cape York militated\r\nagainst its speedy settlement, and it needed the lure of gold to induce\r\nmen to risk their lives in a land with such hostile inhabitants. In 1872\r\nthe Queensland Government decided upon another exploration of the neck of\r\nland that forms the northern-most point of Australia. More than eight\r\nyears had elapsed since the Jardines had made their dashing journey; but\r\ntheir report, coupled with Kennedy's fate, did not offer much temptation\r\nto follow up their footsteps. There was, however, a tract of country near\r\nthe base of the Peninsula still comparatively unknown; and a party was\r\norganised and placed under the leadership of William Hann. Hann was a\r\nnative of Wiltshire, who had come out to the south of Victoria with his\r\nparents at an early age. He was afterwards one of the pioneer squatters\r\nof the Burdekin, in which river his father was drowned. The object of the\r\ntrip was to examine the country as far as the 14th parallel South, with a\r\nspecial view to its mineral resources. The discovery of gold having\r\nextended so far north in Queensland had raised a hope that its existence\r\nwould be traced along the promontory. Hann had with him Taylor as\r\ngeologist, and Dr. Tate as botanist, the latter being a survivor of the\r\nmelancholy Maria expedition to New Guinea. Apparently his ardour for\r\nexploration had not been cooled by the narrow escape he had then\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThe party left Fossilbrook station on the creek of the same name, a\r\ntributary of the Lynd, north of the initial point of the Jardine\r\nexpedition. Crossing much rugged and broken country, they found two\r\nrivers running into the Mitchell, and named them the Tate and the Walsh.\r\n\r\nFrom the Walsh, the party proceeded to the upper course of the Mitchell,\r\nand crossing it, struck a creek, marked on Kennedy's map as \"creek ninety\r\nyards wide.\" This was named the Palmer, and here Warner, the surveyor\r\nfound traces of gold. A further examination of the river resulted in\r\nlikely-looking results being obtained; and the discovery is now a matter\r\nof history, the world-wide Palmer rush to north Queensland being the\r\nresult in 1874.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September, Hann reached his northern limit, and the next\r\nday commenced the ascent of the range dividing the eastern and western\r\nwaters. A few days afterwards, he sighted the Pacific at Princess\r\nCharlotte Bay. From this point the party returned south, and came to a\r\nlarge river which he called the Normanby, where a slight skirmish with\r\nthe natives occurred, the blacks having hitherto been on friendly terms.\r\nWhile the men were collecting the horses in the morning, the natives\r\nattempted to cut them off, each native having a bundle of spears. A few\r\nshots at a long distance were sufficient to disperse them, and the affair\r\nended without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, Hann crossed the historical Endeavour River,\r\nand upon a small creek running into this inlet, he lost one of his horses\r\nfrom poison. Below the Endeavour, the party encountered similar\r\ndifficulties to those that dogged poor Kennedy's footsteps --\r\nimpenetrable scrub and steep ravines. This went on for some days, and an\r\nattempt to reach the seashore involved them in a perfect sea of scrub,\r\nand necessitated the final conclusion that advance by white men and\r\nhorses was impossible. Hann had reluctantly to make up his mind to return\r\nby the Gulf Coast, and abandon the unexplored ground to the south of him.\r\n\r\nAfter many entanglements in the ranges, and confusion arising from the\r\ntortuous courses of the rivers, the watershed was at last crossed, and on\r\nthe 28th of October they camped once more on the Palmer, whence they\r\nsafely returned along their outward course.\r\n\r\nThe gold discoveries on the Palmer, and the rush caused thereby, coming\r\nsoon after this expedition, led to a great deal of minor exploration done\r\nunder the guise of prospecting; and it is greatly to the work of\r\nprospectors for gold that much of the knowledge of the petty details of\r\nthe geographical features of Australia is due. To the courage and\r\nendurance of this class of settler, Australia owes a great debt, but\r\ntheir labours are unrecorded and often forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2. CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Statue of John McDouall Stuart, in the Lands Office,\r\nSydney.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. EDWARD JOHN EYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.1. SETTLEMENT OF ADELAIDE AND THE OVERLANDERS.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the centre of the continent was long retarded by the\r\ndifficult nature of the country -- by its aridity, its few\r\ncontinuously-watered rivers, and the supposed horse-shoe shape of Lake\r\nTorrens, which thrust its vast shallow morass across the path of the\r\ndaring explorers making north.\r\n\r\nFor most of us of the present day, to whom Lake Torrens is but a\r\ngeographical feature, it is hard to imagine the sense of awe it inspired\r\nin the breasts of the South Australian settlers, who appeared to be cut\r\noff completely from the north by its gloomy and forbidding environs of\r\nsalt and barrenness.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Colonel Light surveyed the shores of St. Vincent's Gulf, and\r\nselected the site of the city of Adelaide. Governor Hindmarsh and a\r\ncompany of emigrants arrived soon afterwards, and the Province of South\r\nAustralia was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe very promising discoveries made to the south of the Murray by Major\r\nMitchell soon induced an invasion of adventurous pastoralists bringing\r\ntheir stock from the settled parts of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nCharles Bonney led the way across to the Port Phillip settlement in 1837\r\nwith sheep. G.H. Ebden accompanied him, and they were shortly followed by\r\nmany more: Hamilton, Gardiner, Langbourne, and others, whose names are\r\nwell-known in Australian history as the first Overlanders. Very shortly\r\nthis overlanding of stock was extended to the newly-founded city of\r\nAdelaide, Charles Bonney and Joseph Hawdon being the first drovers on\r\nthis long journey. Their Adelaide journey was in fact an exploration\r\ntrip, and an important one, as they followed the bank of the Murray below\r\nits junction with the Darling; this part of the river having been\r\nfollowed down before only by Sturt, and then only by water.\r\n\r\nIt was in January, 1838, that Hawdon and Bonney left Mitchell's crossing\r\nat the Goulburn River with cattle as pioneers on the overland route to\r\nAdelaide. Unknown to them they were closely followed by E.J. Eyre, with\r\nanother mob of cattle. Eyre, as we shall afterwards see, was thrown out\r\nof the race through trying to make a short cut to avoid the sweeping bend\r\nof the river. Bonney and Hawdon crossed the Murray above the junction of\r\nthe Darling, and in places found the bed of the latter river dry. The\r\nnatives, strange to say, were quite friendly; perhaps they had taken to\r\nheart the lesson Mitchell had read them. But their amiable demeanour did\r\nnot last long. Bonney and Hawdon were almost the last overlanding party\r\nto proceed unmolested. Within a comparatively short time afterwards, an\r\nincessant war began to be waged between the blacks and every Overlander\r\nwho passed down the Murray. It ended only with the sanguinary battle of\r\nthe Rufus. More fortunate than Sturt, Hawdon and Bonney were able to cut\r\noff many of the wearisome bends that had so fatigued Sturt's crew. Sturt\r\nhad had to follow every turn and curve, whilst the Overlanders avoided\r\nthe bends of the Murray by following the native paths, which spared them\r\nin some cases a journey of one or two days. It was while following a\r\nnative path that they discovered and named Lake Bonney. At last they\r\nsighted the Mount Lofty ranges, and after some difficulty in getting\r\nthrough some rough mallee-covered country, arrived at Adelaide, and\r\ngladdened the residents with the prospect of roast beef. \"Up to this\r\ntime,\" says Bonney in his diary, \"they had been living almost exclusively\r\non kangaroo flesh.\" Eyre, whose name was afterwards so closely allied\r\nwith a famous story of thirst and hardship, narrowly escaped with his\r\nlife during his overlanding trip.\r\n\r\nIt was owing to a very natural mistake that Eyre was led astray. He\r\nintended to try a straighter and shorter route than the one round the\r\nMurray, and for a time got on very well, but coming across a tract of dry\r\ncountry across which he could not take the cattle, he determined to\r\nfollow Mitchell's Wimmera River to the north, naturally thinking that it\r\nwould lead him easily to the Murray, and would probably prove to be\r\nidentical with the Lindsay, as marked on Sturt's chart. From Mitchell's\r\nfurthest point, he traced it a considerable distance to the north-west,\r\nand at last found its termination in a large swampy lake, which he called\r\nafter the first Governor of South Australia, Lake Hindmarsh. From this\r\nlake he could find no outlet, so taking with him two men, he made an\r\nattempt to push through to the Murray, leaving his cattle to await him.\r\nHe found the country covered with an almost impenetrable mallee scrub,\r\nand as there was neither grass nor water for the horses, he was forced to\r\nretreat. He reached his camp after a weary struggle on foot, the horses\r\nhaving died from thirst. Eyre was then compelled to return and gain the\r\nbank of the Murray by the nearest available route. The bitter\r\ndisappointment of the trip was, that when forced to retreat by the\r\ninhospitable nature of the country, he was but twenty-five miles from the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nBonney, however, on another occasion, took a mob of cattle from the\r\nGoulburn River to Adelaide in almost a direct line. In February 1839, he\r\nleft the Goulburn and steered a course for the Grampian Mountains, where\r\nhe struck the Wannon, and followed it down to the Glenelg. Here he came\r\nupon one of the Henty stations, and was strongly advised not to persist\r\nin his attempt. Captain Hart, who had been examining the country with the\r\nsame purpose in view as Bonney's, stated that it would be impossible to\r\ntake cattle through and turned back with his own to follow the old route\r\nround the Murray bend. But Bonney was not to be daunted, and resolutely\r\npushed on west of the Glenelg. He discovered and named Lake Hawdon, and\r\nalso named two mountains, Mount Muirhead and Mount Benson. But at\r\nLacepede Bay his most serious troubles commenced. The party had pushed on\r\nsteadily to within forty miles of Lake Alexandrina when, in the middle of\r\na sandy desert, the working bullocks failed. Bonney divided his party,\r\nand sending some of the men back to take the workers to a brackish pool\r\nwhich they had passed, he himself with the stockmen and two black boys,\r\nmade a desperate effort to reach the Lake with the main mob. For two days\r\nthey pushed steadily on, travelling day and night, until men and beasts\r\nwere alike at their last gasp. Bonney then tried a desperate expedient:\r\n\"I then determined,\" he says, \"as a last resource, to kill a calf and use\r\nthe blood to assuage our thirst. This was done, and though the blood did\r\nnot allay the pangs of thirst to any great extent, it restored our\r\nstrength very much.\"\r\n\r\nThe exhausted men then lay down to rest; but whilst they slept their\r\nthirsty beasts scented a faint smell of damp earth on a wandering puff of\r\nwind, and stampeded off to windward. Too weak to follow on at once, the\r\nmen, after an hour or two, staggered after them and tracked them to a\r\nhalf-dry swamp, which still maintained a little mud and water. It was\r\nbrackish, but palatable enough for men in their exhausted condition, and\r\nsaved the lives of all. After some trouble in crossing the Murray, they\r\nreached Adelaide in safety with the stock.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of their arrival reached Port Phillip, many other\r\nOverlanders were encouraged by Bonney's example to try the shorter route,\r\nand the trade in shipping cattle across the straits from Tasmania almost\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nBonney had been born at Sandon, near Stafford, and educated at the\r\nGrammar School, Rugby. He had come out to Sydney in 1834, as clerk to Sir\r\nWilliam Westbrooks Burton; but the love of adventure prevailed over his\r\nother inclinations, and in 1837, he joined Ebden in squatting pursuits,\r\nand eventually distinguished himself as one of the leading Overlanders.\r\nHe subsequently settled in South Australia. From 1842 to 1857 he was\r\nCommissioner for Crown Lands, and he afterwards served the State as\r\nmanager for railways, and in other capacities. Subsequently he returned\r\nto Sydney, where he died.\r\n\r\n11.2. EYRE'S CHIEF JOURNEYS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Edward John Eyre.]\r\n\r\nEdward John Eyre was the son of the Reverend Anthony Eyre, vicar of\r\nHornsea and Long Riston, Yorkshire, and was born on August 14th, 1815. He\r\nwas educated at Louth and Sedburgh Grammar Schools. He came to Australia\r\nin 1833, and immediately engaged in squatting pursuits, his enterprising\r\nspirit constantly leading him beyond the pale of civilization, where his\r\nnatural love for exploration rapidly increased. His fortunes as an\r\nOverlander have already been noticed. On the 5th August, 1839, he left\r\nPort Lincoln, on the western shore of Spencer's Gulf, meaning to\r\npenetrate as far as he could to the westward. Some time before he had\r\nmade an expedition to the north of Adelaide as far as Mount Arden, a\r\nstriking elevation to the North-North-East of Spencer's Gulf. He had\r\nascended this mount, and from the summit seen a depression which he took\r\nto be a lake with a dry bed. This lake afterwards played an important\r\npart in the history of South Australian settlement under the name of Lake\r\nTorrens.\r\n\r\nEyre's party on his westward trip consisted of an overseer, three men,\r\nand two natives. Twenty days after leaving Port Lincoln, they arrived at\r\nStreaky Bay, not having crossed a single stream, rivulet, or chain of\r\nponds the whole distance of nearly three hundred miles. Three small\r\nsprings only had been found, and the country was covered with the gloomy\r\nmallee and tea-tree scrub. Westward of Streaky Bay the country was still\r\nfound to be scrubby; so Eyre formed a camp, and taking only a black boy\r\nwith him, he forced a stubborn way onward, until he was within nearly\r\nfifty miles of the western border of South Australia. To all appearance\r\nthe country was slightly more elevated than the level scrubby flats he\r\nhad been traversing, but there was neither grass nor water, and an\r\nimmediate return became necessary. Before he got back to Streaky Bay\r\ncamp, he nearly lost three of his horses.\r\n\r\nLeaving Streaky Bay again, he went east of north to the head of Spencer's\r\nGulf, finding the country on this route a little better, but still devoid\r\nof water, the party getting through, thanks only to a timely rainfall. On\r\nthe 29th of September, he came to his old camp at Mount Arden, where he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that what I had taken on my last journey to be the bed of\r\na dry lake now contained water, and was of considerable size; but as my\r\ntime was very limited, and the lake at a great distance, I had to forego\r\nmy wish to visit it. I have, however, no doubt of its being salt, from\r\nthe nature of the country, and the fact of finding the water very salt in\r\none of the creeks draining into it from the hills. Beyond this lake\r\n(which I distinguished with the name of Colonel Torrens) to the westward\r\nwas a low, flat-topped range, extending north-westerly, as far as I could\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this point Eyre returned, pursuing his former homeward route.\r\n\r\n[Map. Eyre's Explorations, 1840 and 1841.]\r\n\r\nThe main objects that now attracted the attention of the colonists of\r\nSouth Australia were (1) discovery to the northward, regarding both the\r\nextent of Lake Torrens and the nature of the interior; and (2) the\r\npossibility of the existence of a stock route to the Swan River\r\nsettlement. Eyre, however, after his late experience, was convinced that\r\nthe overlanding of stock around the head of the Great Bight was\r\nimpracticable. The country was too sterile, and the absence of\r\nwater-courses rendered the idea hopeless. For immediate practical\r\nresults, beneficial to the growing pastoral industry, Eyre favoured the\r\nextension of discovery to the north. This then was the course adopted,\r\nand subscriptions were raised towards that end. Eyre himself provided\r\none-third of the needful horses and other expenses; and the Government\r\nand colonists found the remainder.\r\n\r\nMeantime it was found that the country in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nPort Lincoln was not altogether of the same wretched nature as that\r\ntraversed by Eyre between Streaky Bay and the head of Spencer's Gulf.\r\nCaptain Hawson, William Smith, and three others had made an excursion for\r\nsome considerable distance, and found well-grassed country and abundance\r\nof water. From the point whence they turned back, they had seen a fine\r\nvalley with a running stream. This valley they named Rossitur Vale, after\r\nCaptain Rossitur of the French whaler Mississippi, the first foreign\r\nvessel to enter Port Lincoln. Rossitur was the man who was destined later\r\nto afford opportune aid to Eyre, without which he would never have\r\nreached Albany.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, 1840, Eyre's preparations were complete, and he left\r\nAdelaide after a farewell breakfast at Government House, where Captain\r\nSturt presented him with a flag -- the Union Jack -- worked by some of\r\nthe ladies of Adelaide.\r\n\r\nHis party was not a large one considering the nature of the undertaking,\r\nconsisting as it did of six white men and two black boys. At Mount Arden\r\nthey formed a stationary camp. A small vessel called the Waterwitch was\r\nsent to the head of Spencer's Gulf with the heaviest portion of their\r\nsupplies, and the party had three horse drays with them. Eyre trusted\r\nthat a range of hills, which he had seen stretching to the north-east,\r\nwould continue far enough to take him clear of the flat and depressed\r\ncountry around Lake Torrens -- would, in fact, as he says, form a\r\nstepping-stone into the interior.\r\n\r\nTaking one black boy with him, Eyre made a short trip to Lake Torrens,\r\nleaving the rest of the party to land the stores from the Waterwitch. He\r\nfound the bed of the lake coated with a crust of salt, pure white, and\r\nglistening brilliantly in the sunshine. It yielded to the footstep, and\r\nbelow was soft mud, which rapidly grew so boggy as to stop their\r\nprogress. In fact they had to return to the shore without being able to\r\nascertain whether there was any water on the surface or not. At this\r\npoint the lake appeared to be about fifteen or twenty miles across,\r\nhaving high land bounding it on the distant west.\r\n\r\nThere seemed no chance of crossing the lake; and following its shore to\r\nthe north was impossible. There was neither grass nor water; the very\r\nrainwater turned salt after lying a short time on the saline soil. The\r\nonly chance of success appeared to be to keep close to the north-eastern\r\nrange, which Eyre named the Flinders Range, trusting to its broken\r\ngullies to supply them with some scanty grass and rainwater.\r\n\r\nIt was a cheerless outlook. On one side was an impassable lake of\r\ncombined mud and salt; on the other a desert of bare and barren plains;\r\nwhilst their onward path was along a range of inhospitable rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The very stones, lying upon the hills,\" says Eyre, \"looked like scorched\r\nand withered scoria of a volcanic region, and even the natives, judging\r\nfrom the specimen I had seen to-day, partook of the general misery and\r\nwretchedness of the place.\"\r\n\r\nHe directed his course to the most distant point of the Flinders Range,\r\nbut when he arrived there, he was obliged to christen it Mount Deception,\r\nas his hope of finding water there was disappointed. Subsisting as well\r\nas they could on rain puddles on the plains, Eyre and his boy searched\r\nabout for some time and at last found a permanent-looking hole in a small\r\ncreek. They then returned to the main party. Having concealed the\r\nsupplies landed from the cutter, Eyre sent the vessel back to Adelaide\r\nwith despatches, and moved the whole of the men out to the pool of water\r\nthat he had just found. From this vantage point he made various scouting\r\ntrips with the black boy, both to the eastward and westward of north. The\r\n2nd of September found him on the summit of an elevation which he\r\nappropriately named Mount Hopeless, gazing at the salt lake that he now\r\nthought hemmed him in on three sides, even to the eastward. There was no\r\nprospect visible of crossing the lake, which seemed persistently to defy\r\nhim, meeting him at every attempt with a barrier of stagnant mud. There\r\nwas nothing for it but to leave the interior unvisited by this route, and\r\nto return to Mount Arden.\r\n\r\nHe divided his party, sending Baxter, the overseer, with most of the men\r\nand stores straight across to Streaky Bay, where he had formerly made a\r\ncamp, while, with the remainder, he made his way to Port Lincoln. Having\r\nabandoned his intention to penetrate to the interior on a northern\r\ncourse, he now determined to push out westward, to King George's Sound,\r\nfinding, perhaps, on the way across, some inducement that would lead him\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nAt Port Lincoln he could not obtain the extra supplies he wanted without\r\nsending to Adelaide; it was therefore the 24th of October when he finally\r\nstarted for Streaky Bay. He found that Baxter had arrived there safely,\r\nand was anxiously awaiting him.\r\n\r\nHe now camped for many weeks at Fowler's Bay, which was as far as the\r\ncutter they now had, the Hero, could act as convoy, her charter not\r\nextending beyond South Australian waters. The Waterwitch having sprung a\r\nleak, the Hero had taken her place. During the time that they remained\r\nthere, Eyre made many journeys ahead to estimate his chances of getting\r\nacross the dry and barren country intervening between him and the Sound,\r\nbut the outlook was disheartening. He met some natives, who all assured\r\nhim that there was no water ahead; nor could he find any but some\r\nbrackish water obtained by digging in some sandhills. Worse than all, he\r\nsacrificed three of his best horses during these fruitless attempts.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January, the Hero arrived with the oats and bran he had\r\nsent back for. So poverty-stricken was the country that Eyre, in the\r\ncircumstances, resolved to send back nearly the whole of his expedition\r\nby the vessel, and then, with only a small party, to push through to King\r\nGeorge's Sound or perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nBaffled successively to the north and to the west, Eyre had been put upon\r\nhis mettle, and he could not endure the thought of returning to Adelaide\r\na beaten man.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January the cutter departed, and Eyre, Baxter, and three\r\nnative boys, one of whom had come by the vessel on her last trip, were\r\nleft alone to face the eight hundred miles of desert solitude before\r\nthem. Some time was spent in making their final preparations, but on the\r\n24th of February they had actually begun their journey when, to their\r\nastonishment, they heard two shots fired at sea. Thinking that a whaler\r\nhad put in to the bay, Eyre turned back, but found the Hero again in port\r\nwith an urgent request from Adelaide to abandon his desperate project,\r\nand return in the vessel. Upon a man of Eyre's temperament, this recall\r\ncould have only one effect, that of strengthening his resolve to proceed\r\nwestward at all hazards. He did not emulate Cortez by burning his ship\r\nbehind him, but he none the less effectually deprived himself of means of\r\nretreat by dismissing the little Hero.\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of a hot summer when Eyre started, and the nature of\r\nthe sandy soil, combined with the low prickly scrub, soon began to hamper\r\ntheir progress and render the lack of water especially severe. On one\r\nside of them, flanking their line of march, were the cliffs of the Great\r\nBight, against which thundered the ever-restless southern rollers; on the\r\nother there stretched a limitless expanse of dark, gloomy scrub. Their\r\nonly hope of relief was the faint chance of striking some native path\r\nwhich might lead them to an infrequent soakage-spring. Even in these\r\ndepressing circumstances, Eyre seems to have found time to express his\r\nadmiration of Nature as she then revealed herself to him:--\r\n\r\n\"Distressing and fatal as the continuance of these cliffs might prove to\r\nus, there was a grandeur and sublimity in their appearance that was most\r\nimposing, and which struck me with admiration. Stretching out before us\r\nin lofty, unbroken outline, they presented the singular and romantic\r\nappearance of massy battlements of masonry, supported by huge buttresses,\r\nglittering in the morning sun which had now risen upon them, and made the\r\nscene beautiful even amidst the dangers and anxieties of our situation.\"\r\n\r\nFive days of slow, dragging toil passed, until, with the horses at their\r\nlast gasp, and the men baked and parched, they found relief in some\r\nnative wells amongst the sandhills, at a point where the cliffs receded\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for some days at this camp, Eyre, misled by a report he had\r\nobtained from the natives, again moved forward, taking with him but a\r\nsmall supply of water. When he had discovered the blunder, he had gone\r\nforty miles, and over this weary distance the horses had to return. It\r\nwas one of those mishaps that helped so much to wear out his unfortunate\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nTrouble after trouble now added itself to the burden of the explorers.\r\nAnother five days had passed without water, and their only hopes rested\r\nupon some sandhills ahead, seen from the sea by Flinders, and marked by\r\nhim upon his chart. Retreat was impossible, and with their horses failing\r\none after another, they toiled on, desperate and well-nigh hopeless.\r\nEyre's anxiety was increased by Baxter's growing despondency and\r\npessimistic view of the issue of their enterprise. They were now\r\ntravelling along the sea beach, firm and hard, and ominously marked with\r\nwreckage. Their last drop of water had been consumed, and that morning\r\nthey had been collecting dew from the bushes with a sponge, as a last\r\nresource. When they reached the sand-dunes, they were almost too weak to\r\nsearch for a likely place to dig for water; but making a final effort,\r\nthey discovered a patch whence, at six feet, they obtained a supply of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIt was now that Eyre approached the grand crisis of his adventurous\r\njourney. According to the chart compiled by Flinders, he had another long\r\nsuccession of cliffs to encounter, and he knew that where these cliffs\r\ncame in and sternly fronted the ocean, he need hope for no relief. Should\r\nthis space be happily surmounted by a desperate effort, he hoped to reach\r\na kindlier country. Disaffection appeared in his small camp. Baxter was\r\nalways suggesting and even urging a return. Perhaps some shadow of his\r\ntragic fate overhung his spirit. The native boys were ripe for desertion,\r\nand two of them did desert, only to return in a few days, starving, and\r\napparently repentant. Better for Eyre had they gone altogether. Amid such\r\ndiscouraging surroundings did Eyre commence his last struggle with the\r\ncliffs of the Great Bight.\r\n\r\nThe party had been tantalised by threatening clouds, which never broke in\r\nrain. When on the third day they gathered once more, black and lowering.\r\nBaxter urged Eyre to camp that night instead of pushing on, as rain\r\nseemed certain, and the rock holes by which they were then passing were\r\nwell adapted to catch the slightest shower. Eyre consented, against his\r\nbetter judgment. It was necessary to watch the horses lest they should\r\nramble too far, and Eyre kept the first watch. The night was cold, the\r\nwind blowing a gale and driving the flying scud across the face of the\r\nmoon. The horses wandered off in different directions in the scrub,\r\ngiving the tired man much trouble to keep them together. About half-past\r\nten he drove them near the camp intending shortly to call the overseer to\r\nrelieve him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the dead stillness of the night and the wilderness was broken by\r\nthe report of a gun. Eyre was not at first alarmed, thinking it was a\r\nsignal of Baxter's to indicate the position of their camp. He called, but\r\nreceived no answer. Hastening in the direction of the shot, he was met by\r\nWylie, the King George's Sound native, running towards him in great alarm\r\ncrying out: \"Oh, massa, massa, come here!\" and then losing speech from\r\nterror. Eyre was soon at the camp, and one glance was enough to see that\r\nhis purpose must now be pursued grimly alone. Baxter, fatally wounded,\r\nwas stretched upon the ground, bleeding and choking in his last agony. As\r\nEyre raised his faithful companion in his arms he expired.\r\n\r\n\"At the dead hour of night, in the wildest and most inhospitable waste of\r\nAustralia, with the fierce wind raging in unison with the scene of\r\nviolence before me, I was left with a single native, whose fidelity I\r\ncould not rely on, and who, for aught I knew might be in league with the\r\nother two, who, perhaps were even now lurking about to take my life, as\r\nthey had done that of the overseer.\"\r\n\r\nOn examining the camp, Eyre found that the two boys had carried off both\r\ndouble-barrelled guns, all the baked bread and other stores, and a keg of\r\nwater. All they had left behind was a rifle, with the barrel choked by a\r\nball jammed in it, four gallons of water, forty pounds of flour, and a\r\nlittle tea and sugar.\r\n\r\nWhen he had time to think the matter over calmly, Eyre judged, from the\r\nposition of the body, that Baxter must have been aroused by the two\r\nnatives plundering the camp, and that, getting up hastily to stop them,\r\nhe was immediately shot. His first care was to put his rifle into\r\nserviceable condition, and then, when morning broke, he hastened to leave\r\nthe ill-omened place. It was impossible to bury the body of his murdered\r\ncompanion; one unbroken sheet of rock covered the surface of the country\r\nfor miles in every direction. Well might Eyre write, many years\r\nafterwards:--\r\n\r\n\"Though years have now passed away since the enactment of this tragedy,\r\nthe dreadful horrors of that time and scene are recalled before me with\r\nfrightful vividness, and make me shudder even now when I think of them. A\r\nlifetime was crowded into those few short hours, and death alone may blot\r\nout the impressions they produced.\"\r\n\r\nThe two murderers followed the white man and boy during the first day,\r\nevading all Eyre's attempts to bring them to close quarters, and calling\r\nto the remaining boy, Wylie, who refused to go to them. They disappeared\r\nthe next morning, and must have died miserably of thirst and starvation.\r\n\r\nSeven days passed without a drop of water for the horses, before they\r\nreached the end of the line of cliffs, and providentially came to a\r\nnative well amid the sand dunes. From this point water was more\r\nfrequently obtained, and what wretched horses they had left showed feeble\r\nsymptoms of renewed life. At last, when their rations were completely\r\nexhausted, they sighted a ship at anchor in Thistle Cove. She proved to\r\nbe the Mississippi, commanded by Captain Rossitur, the whaler already\r\nreferred to as the first foreign vessel to enter Port Lincoln; and once\r\nmore Eyre had to give thanks for relief at a most critical moment.\r\n\r\nFor ten days, in the hospitable cabin of the French whaler, he forgot his\r\nsufferings, and regained some of his lost strength. Then, provided with\r\nfresh clothes and provisions, and with his horses freshly-shod, Eyre\r\nrecommenced his weary pilgrimage, and, in July, 1841, arrived at his\r\nlong-desired goal, King George's Sound.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting upon this painful march of Eyre's round the Great Bight,\r\none feels an exceeding great pity that so much heroic suffering should\r\nhave been spent on the execution of a purpose the fulfilment of which\r\npromised but little of economic value. The maritime surveys had fairly\r\nestablished the fact that no considerable creek or river found its way\r\ninto the Southern Ocean, either in or about the Great Bight. Granted that\r\nthe outflow of some of our large Australian rivers had been overlooked by\r\nthe navigators, the local conditions were such as to render it virtually\r\ncertain that any such omission was not made along this part of the south\r\ncoast. Here there was to be found no fringe of low, mangrove-covered\r\nflats, studded with inlets and saltwater creeks, thus masking the\r\nentrance of a river. In some parts, a bold forefront of lofty precipitous\r\ncliffs, in others a clean-swept sandy shore, alone faced the ocean.\r\nFlinders, constantly on the alert as he was for anything resembling the\r\nformation of a river-mouth, would scarcely have been mistaken in his\r\nreading of such a coast-line. And the journey resulted in no knowledge of\r\nthe interior, even a short distance back from the actual coast-line. The\r\nconjectures of a worn-out, starving man, picking his way painfully along\r\nthe verge of the beach, were, in this respect, of little moment.\r\n\r\nEyre, however, won for himself well-deserved honour for courage and\r\nperseverance, in as exacting circumstances as ever beset a solitary\r\nexplorer. The picture of the lonely man in his plundered camp bending\r\nover his murdered companion, separated from his fellow-men by countless\r\nmiles of unwatered and untrodden waste, appeals resistlessly to our\r\nsympathies. But admiration of Eyre's good qualities has blinded many to\r\nhis errors of judgment.\r\n\r\nHe was accorded a generous public welcome on his return to Adelaide, and\r\nwas subsequently appointed Police Magistrate on the Murray, where his\r\ninland experience and knowledge of native character were of great\r\nservice. When Sturt started on his memorable trip to the centre of\r\nAustralia, Eyre accompanied his old friend some distance. But his\r\nactivities were exercised in other fields than those of Australian\r\nexploration during his after life. He was Lieutenant-Governor of the\r\nProvince of New Munster in New Zealand under Sir George Grey from 1848 to\r\n1853, when that colony was divided into two provinces. He was afterwards\r\nGovernor-General of Jamaica, where the active and energetic measures he\r\ntook to crush the insurrection of 1865 incited a storm of opposition\r\nagainst him in certain quarters, and he played a leading part in the\r\ngreat constitutional cases of Philips v. Eyre, and The Queen v. Eyre. He\r\ndied at Steeple Aston, in Oxfordshire, in 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. ATTEMPTS TO REACH THE CENTRE.\r\n\r\n[Map (Diagram). Supposed Extent and Formation of Lake Torrens in 1846.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12.1. LAKE TORRENS PIONEERS AND HORROCKS.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Eyre, in 1840, reached, after much labour, an\r\nelevation to the north-east, at the termination of the range which he had\r\nfollowed, and had named it Mount Hopeless. From the outlook from its\r\nsummit he came to the conclusion that the lake was of the shape shown in\r\nthe diagram, completely surrounding the northern portion of the new\r\ncolony of South Australia. In fact, he formed a theory that the colony in\r\nfar distant times had been an island, the low-lying flats to the east\r\njoining the plains west of the Darling. It was in 1843 that the\r\nSurveyor-General of South Australia, Captain Frome, undertook an\r\nexpedition to determine the dimensions of this mysterious lake. He\r\nreached Mount Serle, and found the dry bed of a great lake to the\r\neastward, as Eyre had described, but discovered that Eyre had made an\r\nerror of thirty miles in longitude, placing it too far to the east. He\r\ngot no further north. He thus confirmed the existence of a lake eastward\r\nof Lake Torrens (now Lake Frome), but achieved nothing to prove or\r\ndisprove Eyre's theory of their continuity. Prior to this the pioneers\r\nhad spread settlement both east and west of Eyre's track from Adelaide to\r\nthe head of Spencer's Gulf. Amongst these early leaders of civilisation\r\nin the central state are to be found the names of Hawker, Hughes,\r\nCampbell, Robinson, and Heywood. But unfortunately the details of their\r\nexpeditions in search of grazing country have not been preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. John Ainsworth Horrocks.]\r\n\r\nJohn Ainsworth Horrocks is one of those whose accidental death at the\r\nvery outset of his career plunged his name into oblivion. Had he lived to\r\nclimb to the summit of his ambition as an explorer, it would have been\r\nwritten large in Australian history. That he had some premonition of the\r\nconditions necessary to successful exploration to the west is shown by\r\nhis having been the first to employ the camel as an aid to exploration.\r\nHe took one with him on his last and fatal trip, and it is an example of\r\nfate's cruel irony that the presence of this animal was inadvertently the\r\ncause of his death.\r\n\r\nHorrocks was born at Penwortham Hall, Lancashire, on March 22nd, 1818. He\r\nwas very much taken with the South Australian scheme of colonisation, and\r\nleft London for Adelaide, where he arrived in 1839. He at once took up\r\nland, and with his brother started sheep-farming. He was a born explorer,\r\nhowever, and made several excursions into the surrounding untraversed\r\nland, finding several geographical features, which still preserve the\r\nnames he gave them. In 1846 he organised an expedition along more\r\nextended lines, intending to proceed far into the north-west and west.\r\nAfter having over-looked the ground, he would then prepare another party\r\non a large scale to attempt the passage to the Swan River. He started in\r\nJuly, but in September occurred the disaster which cut him off in the\r\nflower of his promise. In his dying letter he describes how he saw a\r\nbeautiful bird, which he was anxious to obtain:--\r\n\r\n\"My gun being loaded with slugs in one barrel and ball in the other, I\r\nstopped the camel to get at the shot belt, which I could not get without\r\nhis lying down.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst Mr. Gill was unfastening it, I was screwing the ramrod into the\r\nwad over the slugs, standing close alongside of the camel. At this moment\r\nthe camel gave a lurch to one side, and caught his pack in the cock of my\r\ngun, which discharged the barrel I was unloading, the contents of which\r\nfirst took off the middle fingers of my right hand between the second and\r\nthird joints, and entered my left cheek by my lower jaw, knocking out a\r\nrow of teeth from my upper jaw.\"\r\n\r\nHis sufferings were agonising, but he was easy between the fearful\r\nconvulsions, and at the end of the third day after he had reached home,\r\nwhither his companions had succeeded in conveying him, he died without a\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n12.2. CAPTAIN STURT.\r\n\r\nCharles Sturt, whose name is so closely bound up with the exploration of\r\nthe Australian interior, had settled in the new colony which the South\r\nAustralians loyally maintain he had created by directing attention to the\r\noutlet of the Murray. After a short re-survey of the river, from the\r\npoint where Hume crossed it to the junction of the Murray and\r\nMurrumbidgee, which had been one of Mitchell's tasks, he re-entered civil\r\nlife under the South Australian Government. He was now married, and\r\nsettled on a small estate which he was farming, not far from Adelaide. In\r\n1839 he became Surveyor-General, but in October of the same year he\r\nexchanged this office for that of Commissioner of Lands, which he held\r\nuntil 1843. In the following year he commenced his most arduous and\r\nbest-known journey, a journey that has made the names of Sturt's Stony\r\nDesert and the Depot Glen known all over the world, and that has,\r\nunhappily for Australia, done much to create the popular fallacy that the\r\nsoil and climate of the interior are such as preclude comfortable\r\nsettlement by whites. Sturt's graphic account is at times somewhat\r\nmisleading, and the lapse of years has proved his denunciatory judgment\r\nof the fitness of the interior for human habitation to have been hasty.\r\nBut if we examine the circumstances in which he received the impressions\r\nhe has recorded, we must grant that he had considerable justification for\r\nhis statements.\r\n\r\nHe was a broken and disappointed man, worn out by disease and frustrated\r\nhopes, and nearly blind. During six months of his long absence, he had\r\nbeen shut up in his weary depot prison, debarred from attempting the\r\ncompletion of his work, and compelled to watch his friend and companion\r\ndie a lingering death from scurvy. And when the kindly rains released\r\nhim, he was doomed to be repulsed by the ever-present desert wastes. No\r\nwonder that he despaired of the country, and viewed all its prospects\r\nthrough the heated, treacherous haze of the desert plains. Yet now, close\r\nto the ranges where Sturt spent the burning summer months of his\r\ndetention, there has sprung up one of the inland townships of New South\r\nWales, where men toil just as laboriously as in a more temperate zone.\r\n\r\n[Map. Sturt's Route 1844, 1845 and 1846.]\r\n\r\nBut, though baffled and unable to win the goal he strove for, never did\r\nman better deserve success. The instructions that he received from the\r\nHome Office were, to reach the centre of the continent, to discover\r\nwhether mountains or sea existed there, and, if the former, to note the\r\nflow and direction of the northern waters, but on no account to follow\r\nthem down to the north coast. Sturt was instructed to proceed by Mount\r\nArden, a route already tried, condemned, and abandoned by Eyre; and he\r\nelected to proceed by way of the Darling. His plan was to follow that\r\nriver up as far as the Williora, a small western tributary of the\r\nDarling, opposite the place whence Mitchell turned back in 1835, after\r\nhis conflict with the natives, an episode which Sturt found that they\r\nbitterly remembered. Poole, Sturt's second in command, resembling\r\nMitchell in figure and appearance, the Darling blacks addressed him as\r\nMajor, and evinced marked hostility towards him. From Williora, or\r\nLaidley's Ponds, Sturt intended to strike north-west, hoping thus to\r\navoid the gloomy environs of Lake Torrens, and the treacherous surface of\r\nits bed. At Moorundi, on the Murray, where Eyre was then stationed as\r\nResident Magistrate, the party was mustered and the start made.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Poole, Sturt was accompanied by Dr. Browne, a thorough\r\nbushman and an excellent surgeon, who went as a volunteer and personal\r\nfriend. With the party as surveyor's draftsman, went McDouall Stuart,\r\nwhose fame as explorer was afterwards destined nearly to equal that of\r\nhis leader. In addition there were twelve men, eleven horses, one\r\nspring-cart, three bullock-drays, thirty bullocks, one horse-dray, two\r\nhundred sheep, four kangaroo dogs, and two sheep dogs.\r\n\r\nEyre accompanied the expedition as far as Lake Victoria, which they\r\nreached on the 10th of September, 1844. On the 11th of October they\r\narrived at Laidley's Ponds. This was the place from which Sturt intended\r\nto leave the Darling for the interior, and where he expected to find,\r\nfrom the account given him by the natives, a fair-sized creek heading\r\nfrom a low range, visible at a distance to the north-west. But he found\r\nthe stream to be a mere surface channel, distributing the flood water of\r\nthe Darling into some shallow lakes about seven or eight miles distant.\r\nSturt despatched Poole and Stuart to this range to see if they could\r\nobtain a glimpse of the country beyond to the north-west.\r\n\r\nThey returned with the rather startling intelligence that, from the top\r\nof a peak of the range, Poole had seen a large lake studded with islands.\r\n\r\nAlthough in his published journal, written some time after his return,\r\nSturt makes light of Poole's fancied lake, which of course was the effect\r\nof a mirage, at that time his ardent fancy, and the extreme likelihood of\r\nthe existence of a lake in that locality, made him believe that he was on\r\nthe eve of an important discovery. In a letter to Mr. Morphett of\r\nAdelaide, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Poole has just returned from the range. I have not time to write over\r\nagain. He says there are high ranges to the North and North-West, and\r\nwater, a sea, extending along the horizon from South-West by South and\r\nthen East of North, in which there are a number of lofty ranges and\r\nislands, as far as the eye can reach. What is all this? To-morrow we\r\nstart for the ranges, and then for the waters, the strange waters, on\r\nwhich boat never swam and over which flag never floated. But both shall\r\nere long. We have the heart of the interior laid open to us, and shall be\r\noff with a flowing sheet in a few days. Poole says that the sea was a\r\ndeep blue, and that in the midst of it was a conical island of great\r\nheight.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Sturt! No boat was ever to float upon that visionary sea, nor flag\r\nto wave over those dream-born waters. To those who know the experiences\r\nthat awaited the expedition, it is pathetic to read of the leader's\r\nsoaring hopes, as delusive as the desert mirage itself.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the party now removed to a small shallow lakelet, the\r\ncommencement of the Williora channel (Laidley's Ponds). After a short\r\nexcursion to the distant ranges reported by Poole, Sturt, accompanied by\r\nBrowne and two men, went ahead for the purpose of finding water of a\r\nsufficient permanency to remove the whole of the party to. At the small\r\nlake where they were then encamped, there was the ever-present likelihood\r\nof a conflict with the pugnacious natives of the Darling. He was\r\nsuccessful in finding what he wanted, and on the 4th of November the main\r\nbody of the expedition, finally leaving the Darling basin, removed to the\r\nnew water depot.\r\n\r\nThe next day Sturt, with Browne and three men and the cart, started on\r\nanother trip in search of water ahead. This was found in small\r\nquantities, but rain coming on, Sturt returned and sent Poole out again\r\nto search while the camp was being moved. On his return, Poole reported\r\nhaving seen some brackish lakes, and also having caught sight of Eyre's\r\nMount Serle. They were now well on the western slope of the Barrier\r\nRange, and, but for the providential discovery of a fine creek to the\r\nnorthward, which was called Flood's creek, after one of the party, they\r\nwould have been unable to maintain their position. To Flood's creek the\r\ncamp was removed, and Sturt congratulated himself on the steady and\r\nsatisfactory progress he was making.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Sturt's Depot Glen. The Glen, eroded in vertical silurian\r\nslate, is less than a mile long. Poole rests by the creek where the gorge\r\nopens quite abruptly on to a vast cretaceous plain. Photo by the Reverend\r\nJ.M. Curran.]\r\n\r\nThe party now left the Barrier Range, and followed a course to another\r\nrange further north, staying for some time at a small lagoon while\r\nengaged in making an examination of the country ahead. On the 27th of\r\nJanuary, 1845, they camped on a creek rising in a small range, and\r\naffording, at its head, a fine supply of permanent water. When upon its\r\nbanks the explorers pitched their tents, they little thought that it\r\nwould be the 17th of the following July before they would strike camp\r\nagain. This was the Depot Glen, and an extract from Sturt's journal\r\ndepicts the situation of the party:--\r\n\r\n\"It was not, however, until after we had run down every creek in the\r\nneighbourhood, and had traversed the country in every direction, that the\r\ntruth flashed across my mind, and it became evident to me that we were\r\nlocked up in the desolate and heated region into which we had penetrated,\r\nas effectually as if we had wintered at the Pole. It was long, indeed,\r\nere I could bring myself to believe that so great a misfortune had\r\novertaken us, but so it was. Providence had, in its all wise purposes,\r\nguided us to the only spot in that wide-spread desert where our wants\r\ncould have been permanently supplied, but had there stayed our further\r\nprogress into a region that almost appears to be forbidden ground.\"\r\n\r\nThis then was Sturt's prison -- a small creek marked by a line of gum\r\ntrees, issuing from a glen in a low range. By a kindly freak of nature,\r\nenough water had been confined in this glen to provide a permanent supply\r\nfor the exploring party and their animals, during the long term of their\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\nOf Sturt's existence and occupation during this dreary period little can\r\nbe said. He tried to find an avenue of escape in every direction, until\r\nconvinced of the futility of the attempt; sometimes encouraged and lured\r\non by the shallow pools in some fragmentary creek, at others, seeing\r\nnothing before him but hopeless aridity. Now, too, he found himself\r\nattacked with what he then thought to be rheumatism, but which proved to\r\nbe scurvy. Poole and Browne were afflicted in the same manner.\r\n\r\nSturt made one desperate attempt to the north during his imprisonment in\r\nthe Depot Glen, and succeeded in reaching a point one mile beyond the\r\n28th parallel, but further north he could not advance, nor did he find\r\nany inducement to risk the safety of his party.\r\n\r\nThere passed weeks of awesome monotony, relieved by one strange episode.\r\nFrom the apparently lifeless wilderness around them there strayed an old\r\naboriginal into their camp. He was hungry and athirst, and in complete\r\nkeeping with the gaunt waste from which he had emerged. The dogs attacked\r\nhim when he approached, but he stood his ground and fought them valiantly\r\nuntil they were called off. His whole demeanour was calm and courageous,\r\nand he showed neither surprise nor timidity. He drank greedily when water\r\nwas given to him, ate voraciously, and accepted every service rendered to\r\nhim as a duty to be discharged by one fellow-being to another when cut\r\noff in the desert from his kin. He stopped at the camp for some time and\r\nrecognised the boat, explaining that it was upside down, as of course it\r\nwas, and pointing to the North-West as the region where they would use\r\nit, thus raising Sturt's hopes once more. Whence he came they could not\r\ndivine, nor could he explain to them. After a fortnight he departed,\r\ngiving them to understand that he would return, but they never saw him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"With him\" writes Sturt pathetically, \"all our hopes vanished, for even\r\nthe presence of this savage was soothing to us, and so long as he\r\nremained we indulged in anticipations for the future. From the time of\r\nhis departure a gloomy silence pervaded the camp; we were indeed placed\r\nunder the most trying circumstances: everything combined to depress our\r\nspirits and exhaust our patience. We had witnessed migration after\r\nmigration of the feathered tribes, to that point to which we were so\r\nanxious to push our way. Flights of cockatoos, of parrots, of pigeons,\r\nand of bitterns; birds also whose notes had cheered us in the wilderness,\r\nall had taken the same road to a better and more hospitable region.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the water began to sink with frightful rapidity, and all thought\r\nthat surely the end must be near. Hoping against hope, Sturt laid his\r\nplans to start as soon as the drought broke up. He himself was to proceed\r\nnorth and west, whilst poor Poole, reduced to a frightful condition by\r\nscurvy, was to be sent carefully back to the Darling, as the only means\r\nof saving his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Poole's Grave and Monument, near Depot Glen, Tibbuburra,\r\nNew South Wales. Photo by the Reverend J.M. Curran.]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th and 13th of June the rain came, and the drought-beleaguered\r\ninvaders of the desert were relieved. But Poole did not live to profit by\r\nthe rain. Every arrangement was made for his comfort that their\r\ncircumstances permitted, but on the first day's journey he died. His body\r\nwas brought back and buried under the elevation which they called the Red\r\nHill, and which is now known as Mount Poole, three and a-half miles from\r\nDepot Camp.\r\n\r\nSturt's way was now open. He again despatched the party selected to\r\nreturn to the Darling, whose departure had been interrupted by Poole's\r\nuntimely death, and, with renewed hope, made his preparations for the\r\nlong-denied north-west.\r\n\r\nHaving first removed the depot to a better grassed locality, he made a\r\nshort trip to the west. On the 4th of August he found himself on the edge\r\nof an immense shallow, sandy basin, in which water was standing in\r\ndetached sheets, \"as blue as indigo, and as salt as brine.\" This he took\r\nto be a part of Lake Torrens. He returned to the new depot, called Fort\r\nGrey, which was sixty or seventy miles to the north-west of the Glen, and\r\narranged matters for his final departure.\r\n\r\nMcDouall Stuart was left in charge of the depot. Dr. Browne accompanied\r\nthe leader, and on the 14th of August a start was made. For some\r\ndistance, owing to the pools of surface water left by the recent rain,\r\nthey had no difficulty in keeping a straightforward course. The country\r\nthey passed over consisted of large, level plains, intersected by\r\nsand-ridges; but they crossed numerous creeks with more or less water in\r\nall of them. To one of these creeks Sturt gave the name of Strzelecki.\r\nFinally they reached a well-grassed region which greatly cheered them\r\nwith the prospect of success it held out. Suddenly they were confronted\r\nwith a wall of sand; and for nearly twenty miles they toiled over\r\nsuccessive ridges. Fortunately they found both water and grass, but the\r\nunexpected check to their brighter anticipations was depressing. Nor did\r\na walk to the extremity of one of the ridges serve to raise their\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nSturt saw before him what he describes as an immense plain, of a dark\r\npurple hue, with a horizon like that of the sea, boundless in the\r\ndirection in which he wished to proceed. This was Sturt's Stony Desert.\r\nThat night they camped within its dreary confines, and during the next\r\nday crossed an earthy plain, with here and there a few bushes of\r\npolygonum growing beside some straggling channel in which they\r\noccasionally found a little muddy rain-water remaining. At night when\r\nthey camped just before dusk, they sighted some hills to the north, and,\r\non examining them through the telescope, they discerned dark shadows on\r\nthe faces, as if produced by cliffs. Next morning they made for these\r\nhills, in the hope of finding a change of country and feed for the\r\nhorses, but they were disappointed. Sand ridges in repulsive array\r\nconfronted them once more. \"Even the animals,\" writes Sturt, \"appeared to\r\nregard them with dismay.\"\r\n\r\nOver plains and sand dunes, the former full of yawning cracks and holes,\r\nthe party pushed on, subsisting on scanty pools of muddy water and\r\nfast-sinking native wells. On the 3rd of September, Flood, the stockman\r\nwho was riding in the lead, lifted his hat and waved it on high, calling\r\nto the others that a large creek was in sight.\r\n\r\nWhen the main party came up, they feasted their eyes on a beautiful\r\nwatercourse, its bed studded with pools of water and its banks clothed\r\nwith grass. This creek Sturt named Eyre's Creek, and it was an important\r\ndiscovery in the drainage system of the region that he was then\r\ntraversing.\r\n\r\nAlong this new-found watercourse, they were enabled to make easy stages\r\nfor five days, when the course of the creek was lost; nor could any\r\ncontinuation be traced. The lagoons, too, that were found a short\r\ndistance from the banks, proved to be intensely salt. Repeated efforts to\r\ncontinue his journey to other points of the compass only led Sturt\r\namongst the terrible sandhills, their parallel rows separated by barren\r\nplains encrusted with salt. Sturt now came to the erroneous conclusion\r\nthat he had reached the head of Eyre's Creek, and that further progress\r\nwas effectually barred by a waterless tract of country. In fact, he was\r\nthen within reach of a well-watered river, along which he could have\r\ntravelled right up to the main dividing range of the northern coast. But\r\nSturt was baffled in the most depressed area on the surface of the\r\ncontinent, where rivers and creeks lost their identity in the numberless\r\nchannels into which they divided before reaching their final home in the\r\nthirsty shallows of the then unknown Lake Eyre. There was neither sign\r\nnor clue afforded him; his men were sick, and any further progress would\r\njeopardise his retreat. There was nothing for it but to fall back once\r\nmore; and, after a toilsome journey, they reached Fort Grey on the 2nd of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nSturt's last effort had been made to the west of north; he now made up\r\nhis mind for a final effort due north. Before starting, however, he\r\nbegged of Browne, who was still suffering, to retreat, while the way was\r\nyet open, to the Darling. This Browne resolutely refused to do; stating\r\nthat it was his intention to share the fate of the expedition. The 9th of\r\nOctober saw Sturt again under way to the seemingly forbidden north,\r\nStuart and two fresh men accompanying him. On the second day they reached\r\nStrzelecki Creek, and on the 13th they came on to the bank of a\r\nmagnificent channel, with fine trees growing on its grassy banks, and\r\nabundance of water in the bed. This was the now well-known Cooper's\r\nCreek, which Sturt, on his late trip, had crossed unnoticed, as it was\r\nthen dry and divided into several channels on their route. This was the\r\nmost important discovery made in connection with the lake system,\r\nCooper's Creek being one of the far-reaching affluents, its tributaries\r\ndraining the inland slopes of the main dividing range.\r\n\r\nSturt, on making this unexpected discovery, was undecided whether to\r\nfollow Cooper's Creek up to the eastward or persevere in his original\r\nintention of pushing to the north. A thunder-storm falling at the time\r\nmade him adhere to his original determination, and defer the examination\r\nof the new river until his return.\r\n\r\nSeven days after crossing Cooper's Creek, he had the negative\r\nsatisfaction of seeing his gloomy forebodings fulfilled. Once more he\r\ngazed over the dreary waste of the stony desert, unchanged and repellant\r\nas ever. They crossed it, but were again turned back by sandhill and salt\r\nplain, and forced to retrace their steps to Cooper's Creek. This creek\r\nSturt followed up for many days, but found that it came from a more\r\neasterly direction than the route he desired to travel along; moreover,\r\nthe one broad channel that they had commenced to follow became divided\r\ninto several ana-branches, running through plains subject to inundation.\r\nThis became so tiring to their now exhausted horses, who were woefully\r\nfootsore, that he reluctantly turned back. He had found the creek peopled\r\nwith well-nurtured natives, and the prospects of advancing were brighter\r\nthan they had ever been; but both Sturt and his men were weak and ill,\r\nand the horses almost incapable of further effort. Moreover, he was not\r\ncertain of his retreat.\r\n\r\nAs they went down Cooper's Creek on their way back, they found that the\r\nwater was drying up so rapidly that grave fears were entertained lest\r\nStrzelecki's Creek, their main resource in getting back to Fort Grey,\r\nshould be dry. Fortunately they were in time to find a little muddy fluid\r\nleft, just enough to serve their needs. Here, though most anxious to get\r\non, they were forced to camp the whole of one day, on account of an\r\nextremely fierce hot wind.\r\n\r\nSturt's vivid account of the day spent during the blast of that\r\nfurnace-like sirocco has been oft quoted. But the reader should remember\r\nwhen reading it that the man who wrote it was in such a weakened\r\ncondition that he had not sufficient energy left to withstand the hot\r\nwind, whilst the shade under which the party sought shelter was of the\r\nscantiest description.\r\n\r\nThey had still a distance of eighty-six miles to cover to get back to\r\nFort Grey, with but little prospect of finding water on the way. After a\r\nlong and weary ride they reached it, only to find the tents struck, the\r\nflag hauled down, and the Fort abandoned. The bad state of the water and\r\nthe steady diminution of supply had forced Browne to fall back to Depot\r\nGlen, riding day and night Sturt reached the old encampment, so exhausted\r\nthat he could hardly stand after dismounting.\r\n\r\nThe problem of their final escape had now to be resolved. The water in\r\nDepot Creek was reduced so low that they feared there would be none left\r\nin Flood's Creek. If this failed, they were once more imprisoned. Browne,\r\nnow much recovered, undertook the long ride of one hundred and eighteen\r\nmiles which would decide the question. Preparations had been made for his\r\njourney by filling a bullock skin with water, and sending a dray with it\r\nas far as possible. On the eighth day he returned.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Browne,\" asked Sturt, who was helpless in his tent, \"what news? Is\r\nit good or bad?\" \"There is still water in the creek,\" replied Browne,\r\n\"but that is all I can say; what there is is as black as ink, and we must\r\nmake haste, for in a week it will be gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat that was to have floated over the inland sea was left to rot at\r\nDepot Glen. All the heaviest of the stores were abandoned, and the\r\nretreat of over two hundred miles commenced.\r\n\r\nMore bullock-skins were fashioned into water-bags, and with their aid and\r\nthat of a scanty but kindly shower of rain, they crossed the dry stage to\r\nFlood's Creek in safety. Here they found the growth of the vegetation\r\nmuch advanced, and with care, and constant activity in searching ahead\r\nfor water, they gradually increased the distance from the scene of their\r\nsufferings, and approached the Darling. Sturt had to be carried on one of\r\nthe drays, and lifted on and off at each stopping-place. On the 21st of\r\nDecember, they arrived at the camp of the relief-party under Piesse, at\r\nWilliorara, and Sturt's last expedition came to an end.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of this explorer, we quote a short extract from his\r\nJournal to show the exalted character of the man whom Australians should\r\never regard with the greatest of pride:--\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances may yet arise to give a value to my recent labours, and my\r\nname may be remembered by after generations in Australia as the first who\r\ntried to penetrate to its centre. If I failed in that great object, I\r\nhave one consolation in the retrospect of my past services. My path among\r\nsavage tribes has been a bloodless one, not but that I have often been\r\nplaced in situations of risk and danger, when I might have been justified\r\nin shedding blood, but I trust I have ever made allowance for human\r\ntimidity, and respected the customs of the rudest people.\"\r\n\r\nSturt's health and eyesight had been greatly impaired by his last trip,\r\nbut although he was for a time almost totally blind, he still managed to\r\ndischarge the duties of Colonial Secretary. He was at last pensioned by\r\nthe South Australian Government, and soon afterwards returned to England.\r\nHe died at his residence at Cheltenham. Though the Home Office had\r\ntreated him disgracefully during his life, and ignored his services, he\r\nlives for ever in the hearts of the Australians as the hero and chief\r\nfigure of the exploration of their country. When he was on his death-bed,\r\nin 1869, the empty title of knighthood was conferred upon him. As he\r\ncould not enjoy the tardy honour, his widow, who lived until 1887, was\r\ngraciously allowed to wear the bauble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. BABBAGE AND STUART.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.1. B. HERSCHEL BABBAGE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. B. Herschel Babbage. Born 1815; died 1878.]\r\n\r\nThe unsolved problem of the extent and other details of that vast region\r\nof salt lakes and flat country then known under the generic name of Lake\r\nTorrens still greatly occupied the attention and excited the imaginations\r\nof the colonists of South Australia. And the accounts brought back by the\r\ndifferent exploring parties were conflicting in the extreme. In 1851, two\r\nsquatters, named Oakden and Hulkes, out run-hunting, pushed westward of\r\nLake Torrens, and found suitable grazing country. They also discovered a\r\nlake of fresh water, and heard from the natives of other lakes to the\r\nnorth-west some fabulous legends of strange animals. Their horses giving\r\nin, Oakden and Hulkes returned, but although they applied for a squatting\r\nlicence for the country they had been over, it was not then settled or\r\nstocked. In 1856, Surveyor Babbage made some explorations in the field\r\npartly traversed by Eyre and Frome. He penetrated through the plains that\r\nwere supposed to occupy the central portion of the horseshoe formation at\r\nthat time associated in the public opinion with Lake Torrens. More\r\nfortunate than his predecessors, he found permanent water in a gum-tree\r\ncreek, and saw some fair-sized sheets of water, one of which he named\r\nBlanche Water, or Lake Blanche. Some further excursions led to the\r\ndiscovery of more fresh water and well-grassed pastoral country. The\r\naboriginals, too, directed him to what they said was a crossing-place in\r\nthat portion of Lake Torrens that had been sighted, in 1845, by Poole and\r\nBrowne of Captain Sturt's party, when Poole thought he saw an inland sea.\r\nTheir directions, however, proved unreliable, or Babbage failed to find\r\nthe place, for he lost his horse in the attempt to cross the lake.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, another excursion to the westward of Lake Torrens was made by a\r\nMr. Campbell, who discovered a creek of fresh water, which he called the\r\nElizabeth. He also visited Lake Torrens, of which he reported in similar\r\nterms to those of previous explorers -- that it was surrounded with\r\nbarren country.\r\n\r\nIn April of the same year, a survey conducted by Deputy Surveyor-General\r\nGoyder, over the same country as that lately explored by Babbage, led to\r\nsome absurd mistakes. A few miles north of Blanche Water he came to many\r\nsurface springs surrounding a fine lagoon. To the north of them was an\r\nisolated hill, which he called Weathered Hill. From the summit of this\r\nhill he had a curious example of the effects of refraction in this region\r\nin a similar illusion to that which suggested Poole's inland sea. To the\r\nnorthward he saw a belt of gigantic gum-trees, and beyond them what\r\nappeared to be a sheet of water with elevated land on the far side. To\r\nthe eastward was another large lake. But all this was but the glamourie\r\nof the desert -- on closer examination the gigantic gums dwindled down to\r\nstunted bushes, and the mountainous ground to broken clods of earth.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest surprise reserved for Goyder was at Lake Torrens, where\r\nhe found the water quite fresh. He described the Lake as stretching from\r\nfifteen to twenty miles to the north-west, with a water horizon, with an\r\nextensive bay forming to the southward; while to the north, a bluff\r\nheadland and perpendicular cliffs were clearly to be discerned with the\r\ntelescope. From the appearance of the flood-marks, Goyder came to the\r\nconclusion that there was little or no rise and fall in the lake, drawing\r\nthe natural conclusion that its size was such as not to be influenced\r\nappreciably by flood waters, but that it absorbed them without showing\r\nany variation in its level.\r\n\r\nAdelaide was overjoyed at the news. The threatening desert that hemmed in\r\ntheir fair province to the north was suddenly converted into a land of\r\nmilk and honey. The Surveyor-General, Colonel Freeling, immediately\r\nstarted out, taking with him both a boat and an iron punt with which to\r\nfloat on these new waters. But there was a sudden fall to their hopes\r\nwhen a letter was received from him stating that the cliffs, the bay, and\r\nthe head-lands were all built up on the airy foundation of a mirage. The\r\nelves and sprites of this desolate region had been playing a hoax upon\r\nGoyder's party. But it is no wonder that Goyder had been so open to\r\ndeception after unexpectedly finding fresh water in the lake that had\r\nbeen so long known as salter than the sea.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the lake, Freeling found the water still almost fresh; but\r\none of Goyder's men who accompanied him, told him that it had already\r\nreceded half-a-mile since the latter's visit. An attempt to float the\r\npunt was made, but after dragging it through mud and a few inches of\r\nwater for a quarter of a mile, the men abandoned the attempt as hopeless.\r\nFreeling and some of the party then started to wade through the slush,\r\nbut after proceeding three miles, and then sounding only six inches of\r\nwater, they returned. Some of the more adventurous extended their muddy\r\nwade, but only met with a similar result. Lake Torrens was re-invested\r\nwith its evil name, only somewhat shrunken in proportions.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1857, Stephen Hack started with a party from Streaky\r\nBay to examine the Gawler Range of Eyre, and investigate the country west\r\nof Lake Torrens. He reached the Gawler Range and examined the country\r\nvery carefully, finding numerous fresh-water springs, and large plains\r\ncovered with both grass and saltbush. He also discovered a large salt\r\nlake, Lake Gairdner. Simultaneously with Hack's expedition, a party under\r\nMajor Warburton was out in the same neighbourhood; in fact, Hack's party\r\ncrossed Warburton's tracks on one or two occasions. Strange to say, the\r\nreports of the two were flatly contradictory. Warburton described the\r\ncountry as dry and arid; but Hack's account was distinctly favourable. Of\r\nthe two men, however, it is most probable that Hack possessed the more\r\nexperience and knowledge of country, and, moreover, Time, the great\r\narbitrator, has endorsed his words.\r\n\r\nThe year 1857 saw much exploration done in South Australia. One party,\r\nconsisting of Swinden, Campbell, Thompson, and Stock, at about seventy\r\nmiles from the head of Spencer's Gulf, found good pastoral country and a\r\npermanent water-hole called by the natives Pernatty. to the north they\r\ncame upon Campbell's former discovery of the Elizabeth, but their\r\nprovisions failing they were forced to return.\r\n\r\nA month afterwards Swinden started again from Pernatty. North of the\r\nGawler Range he found available pastoral country, which became known as\r\nSwinden's country. During this year also, Miller and Dutton explored the\r\ncountry at the back of Fowler's Bay. Forty miles to the north they saw\r\ntreeless, grassy plains stretching far inland, but could find no\r\npermanent water. Warburton afterwards reported in depreciatory terms of\r\nthis region; but Delisser and Hardwicke, who also visited it, stated that\r\nit would make first-class pastoral country if only surface water could be\r\nobtained. During the whole of Warburton's career, his judgment of the\r\npastoral value of country seems to have been lamentably defective. He\r\nmade no allowance for the varying nature of the seasons. A suggestion\r\nthat he made to the South Australian Government to explore the interior,\r\nwhich had turned back such men as Sturt and Gregory, with the aid of the\r\npolice, verges on the ludicrous.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, the South Australian Government voted a sum of money to fit out\r\na party to continue the northern explorations. This party was put under\r\nthe leadership of Babbage; but he was not given a free hand, being\r\nhampered with official instructions, and there being no allowance made\r\nfor unforeseen exigencies. His instructions were to examine the country\r\nbetween Lakes Torrens and Gairdner, and to map the respective western and\r\neastern shores of the two lakes, so as to remove for the future any doubt\r\nas to their actual formation and accurate position. This alone, apart\r\nfrom any extended exploration, meant a work of considerable time; but,\r\nunfortunately for the surveyor in charge, the general public was just\r\nthen eager for fresh discoveries of available pastoral land, and was\r\ninclined to regard survey work as of secondary importance. It took\r\nseveral months to complete the survey work of the two lakes, and when\r\nBabbage returned to Port Augusta he found that Harris, the second in\r\ncommand of his depot camp, had started to return to Adelaide with many of\r\nthe drays and horses. Babbage rode one hundred and sixty miles before he\r\novertook him at Mount Remarkable, and there learned that the South\r\nAustralian Government had changed its official mind with regard to the\r\nconduct of the expedition, and had decided that it should be conducted in\r\nfuture with pack-horses only.\r\n\r\nIt was A.C. Gregory's arrival in Adelaide with pack-horses from his last\r\nexpedition down the Barcoo that had led to this change of tactics.\r\nCharles Gregory, who had accompanied his brother, was now engaged by the\r\nGovernment to overtake Babbage and acquaint him with their intention, but\r\nwhen he reached Port Augusta, Gregory took it upon himself to order the\r\ndrays home, Babbage being away surveying. Babbage overtook them and\r\nordered them back; but pleading Government orders, they refused to\r\nreturn. Babbage wrote to the authorities pointing out the unfairness of\r\ntheir action, and, mustering up a small party, returned to continue his\r\nwork with six months' provisions.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Babbage gave more time to discovery than he had done\r\nbefore. He went out beyond the boundaries of his survey, and pushed on to\r\nChambers Creek, so called by Stuart, who discovered it while Babbage was\r\nbusy at Lake Gairdner. Babbage traced Chambers Creek into Lake Eyre, and\r\nwas thus the first discoverer of this lake, which he called Lake Gregory.\r\nHe found a range which he called Hermit Range, but from its crest\r\ndiscerned no sign of Lake Torrens, thus settling a certain limit to its\r\nextension to the north. He made further explorations to the west of Lake\r\nGregory, now Lake Eyre, and found some hot springs. Meanwhile, during the\r\ntime he was making these researches, the Government had, in a very\r\nhigh-handed manner, appointed Warburton to supersede him. Warburton\r\nstarted out to find Babbage, taking Charles Gregory as his second.\r\nFailing to find him at the Elizabeth, he followed and overtook him at the\r\nnewly-discovered Lake Gregory. Warburton made a few discoveries while\r\nseeking for Babbage, amongst them the Douglas, a creek which was\r\nafterwards of great assistance to Stuart, and the Davenport Range; and he\r\nalso came upon some fair pastoral country.\r\n\r\nBabbage's surveys and explorations had done much to clear up the mystery\r\nand confusion that had hitherto obscured the geography of the salt lake\r\nregion. His discovery of Lake Eyre (Gregory) and of the complete\r\nisolation of Lake Torrens, reduced the component parts of that huge\r\nsaline basin to some sort of method and order. In addition to these\r\nachievements, Surveyor Parry made some further discoveries both of fresh\r\nwater and available pastoral country to the eastward of the Lake.\r\n\r\nB. Herschel Babbage was the eldest son of the well-known inventor of the\r\ncalculating machine. He had been educated as an engineer, and for a\r\nconsiderable time had followed his profession in Europe. He had been\r\nengaged on several main lines in England, and had worked in conjunction\r\nwith the celebrated Brunel. He had also been commissioned by the\r\nGovernment of Piedmont to report on a line across the Alps by way of\r\nMount Cenis. He had remained in Italy some years until his work was\r\ninterrupted by the revolution. He had returned to England, and had\r\nsubsequently come to South Australia in 1851, in the ship Hydaspes. He\r\ndied at his residence, in 1878, at St. Mary's, South Road, where he had a\r\nvineyard.\r\n\r\n13.2. JOHN MCDOUALL STUART.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. John McDouall Stuart.]\r\n\r\nJohn McDouall Stuart, the great explorer of the centre of Australia,\r\narrived in South Australia in 1839. His first experience of Australian\r\nexploration was sufficiently trying, gained as it was when he was acting\r\nas a draughtsman with Captain Sturt on his last arduous expedition. But\r\nit had kindled in him a high ardour for discovery, and fostered a\r\nstubborn resolution to carry through whatever he undertook.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his early explorations when in a position to do so\r\nindependently, to the north-west of Swinden's country, in search of some\r\nlocality called by the natives Wingillpin. Not finding it, he came to the\r\nstrange conclusion that Wingillpin and Cooper's Creek were one and the\r\nsame, although he was now on a different watershed. He also, at that\r\nperiod, seems to have entertained somewhat extensive notions of the\r\ncourse of Cooper's Creek, as in one part of his Journal he remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"My only hope of cutting Cooper's Creek is on the other side of the\r\nrange. The plain we crossed to-day resembles those of the Cooper, also\r\nthe grasses. If it is not there, it must run to the north-west, and form\r\nthe Glenelg of Captain Grey.\"\r\n\r\nNow, although we know that Grey held rather extravagant notions of the\r\nimportance of the Glenelg, even he would not have thought it possible for\r\nthe Glenelg to be the outlet of such a mighty river as Cooper's Creek\r\nwould have become by the time it reached the north-west coast.\r\n\r\nStuart's horses were now too footsore to proceed over the stony country\r\nhe found himself then in, and he had no spare shoes with him. Failing\r\ntherefore to find the promised land of Wingillpin, although he had passed\r\nover much good and well-watered country, he turned to the south-west, and\r\nmade some explorations in the neighbourhood of Lake Gairdner. Before\r\nthis, however, he had found and named Chambers Creek. From Lake Gairdner,\r\nhe steered for Fowler's Bay, and his description of some of the country\r\nhe passed is anything but inviting. From a spur of the high peak that he\r\nnamed Mount Finke, he saw:--\r\n\r\n\"A prospect gloomy in the extreme: I could see a long distance, but\r\nnothing met the eye save a dense scrub, as black and dismal as night.\"\r\n\r\n[Map. Stuart's Routes 1858, 1859, 1860, 1861, 1862; Burke and Wills's\r\nRoute 1860 and 1861.]\r\n\r\nFrom this point the party passed into a sandy spinifex desert, which\r\nStuart says was worse than Sturt's; there had been a little salt-bush\r\nthere, but here there was nothing but spinifex to be found, and the\r\nbarren ground provided no food of any kind for the horses.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs was becoming desperate with the little band, as\r\ntheir provisions were nearly finished; and though the leader was tempted\r\nto persist in the search for good pastoral country, he was at last forced\r\nto abandon the search and beat a hasty retreat. Dense scrub and the same\r\n\"dreary dismal desert,\" as he calls it in his Journal, surrounded them\r\nday after day. Tired out and half-starved they reached the coast, and had\r\nbut two meals left to carry them to Streaky Bay, where they found relief\r\nat Gibson's station. Here the sudden change from starvation to a full\r\ndiet invalided most of them, and Stuart himself was very ill for some\r\ndays. Finally they reached Thompson's station at Mount Arden, and there\r\nStuart's first expedition terminated.\r\n\r\nBut this severe test only whetted Stuart's appetite for further\r\nexploration, and in April, 1859, he made another start. After crossing\r\nover some of the already-traversed country, Hergott, one of his\r\ncompanions, found the now well-known springs that bear his name. Stuart\r\ncrossed his former discovery of Chambers Creek, and made for the\r\nDavenport Range, discovered by Warburton, finding many of the mound\r\nsprings that characterize some parts of the interior. On the 6th of June\r\nhe discovered a large creek, which he called the Neale. It ran through\r\nvery good country, and Stuart followed it down, hoping to find it\r\nincrease in volume and value as he went. In this he was not disappointed,\r\nas large plains covered with salt-bush and grass were found, and the\r\nparty encountered several more springs. After satisfying himself of the\r\nextent and economic value of the country he had found, Stuart was obliged\r\nto return; for his horses' shoes had again worn out, and he had a lively\r\nand painful remembrance of the misery which his horses had suffered\r\nbefore from the lack of them.\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year, he made a third expedition in the vicinity\r\nof Lake Eyre, but there is little of interest attaching to the Journal of\r\nthis trip, as his course was mostly over closely explored country. He\r\nreached the Neale again, and instituted a survey of the promising\r\npastoral country he had traversed during his last trip, approaching at\r\ntimes to within sight of what he calls in his Journal Lake Torrens, but\r\nwhich in reality was what is now known as Lake Eyre. All these minor\r\nexpeditions of Stuart's may be looked upon as preparatory to his great\r\nstruggle to find an available passage through the unknown fastnesses of\r\nthe centre of the continent.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1860 that Stuart made the first of his daring and stubborn\r\nattempts to cross Australia from south to north. The South Australian\r\nGovernment had offered a standing reward of 2,000 pounds for the man who\r\nshould first succeed in this undertaking.\r\n\r\nStuart's party on his first trip was but a very small one: three men in\r\nall, with but thirteen horses. It reads lilliputian compared with the\r\nprincely cavalcade that later on set out with Burke to travel over\r\ncomparatively well-known country, involving only a short excursion\r\nthrough a land without natural difficulties or obstacles; and yet it\r\nactually achieved the greatest part of the task set it.\r\n\r\nStuart started from Chambers Creek, but for part of the journey he was of\r\ncourse travelling over country that was fairly well-known by that time.\r\nAfter passing the Neale, he entered untrodden country, which proved to be\r\ngood available pastoral land. Numerous well-watered creeks were passed,\r\nwhich were named respectively the Frew, the Finke, and the Stevenson, and\r\non the 6th of April they reached a hill of a remarkable shape, which had\r\nfor some time attracted and excited their attention and curiosity. They\r\nfound it to be a column of sandstone, on the apex of a hill. The hill was\r\nbut a low one of a few hundred feet in height, but the sandstone column\r\nthat surmounted it was one hundred and fifty feet in height and twenty\r\nfeet in width. This striking object was named by Stuart Chambers Pillar,\r\nto commemorate a friend who had assisted him greatly in his explorations.\r\nIt stood amongst other elevations of fantastic shapes and grotesque\r\nformations, resembling ruined forts and castles. On the 9th of April they\r\nsighted two remarkable bluffs, and on the 12th reached the range of which\r\nthe bluffs formed the centre. The eastern bluff was called Brinkley Bluff\r\nand the western Hanson Bluff; the range, which is now well-known as a\r\nleading geographical feature of Australia, and on which the most elevated\r\npeaks in the interior have since been found, Stuart named the MacDonnell\r\nRange, after the then Governor of South Australia. The little band\r\ncrossed the range, which was rough but had good grass on its slopes.\r\nThere was, however, a scarcity of water; for they were now approaching\r\nthe tropical line, and on reaching the northern slope of the range found\r\nthemselves amongst spinifex and scrub, and obliged to undergo two nights\r\nwithout water for the horses. At a high peak, which was named Mount\r\nFreeling, they found a small supply; and as it was now evident that there\r\nwas dry country ahead, a more careful search was made before pushing any\r\nfurther forward, in order to ensure certain means of retreat. Fortunately\r\nthey found, amongst some ledges of rock, a large natural reservoir, which\r\npromised to be permanent, and capable of supplying their wants on their\r\nhomeward way.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of April, Stuart camped in the centre of Australia, on the\r\nspot which his former leader, Sturt, had vainly undergone so much\r\nsuffering to reach; and his feeling of elation must have been tempered\r\nwith regret that his old leader was not then with him to share this\r\nsuccess. About two miles and a half to the North-North-East there was a\r\ntolerably high hill which he called in reality Central Mount Sturt. It is\r\nnow, however, erroneously called Stuart, owing to the publishers of his\r\ndiary having misread his manuscript.\r\n\r\nHaving, in company with his tried companion Kekwick, climbed the mount,\r\nhe erected a cairn of stones at the top and hoisted the Union Jack. They\r\nthen recommenced their northern journey. That night they camped without\r\nfinding water, but the next morning were lucky enough to get a permanent\r\nsupply. Then ensued much delay, caused by fruitless attempts to strike\r\neither to the eastward or the westward. Stuart tried on several occasions\r\nto reach the head of the Victoria River, but failed, and sacrificed some\r\nhorses. On a creek he called the Phillips, some natives were encountered\r\nwho, according to Stuart, made and answered a masonic sign.\r\n\r\nTo the north of this spot, the explorers came to a large gum-tree creek,\r\nwith very fair-sized sheets of water in it. As they followed down, they\r\npassed an encampment of natives, but kept steadily on their course\r\nwithout interfering with them. Not finding any water lower down the\r\ncreek, the party had to return, and when close to the creek at the point\r\nwhere they had crossed that morning, they were suddenly surrounded by a\r\nmob of armed and painted savages, who had emerged unexpectedly from\r\nconcealment in a clump of scrub. To all attempts at peaceful parley they\r\nreturned showers of boomerangs and clubs, until the whites were compelled\r\nin self-defence to fire on them. Even then they were not deterred from\r\nfollowing the party, even up to the camp of the night before. This\r\nincident caused Stuart to hesitate. His party was so small that the loss\r\nor even disablement of one man would have crippled the expedition; and\r\nthey had already lost a good many horses. He therefore wisely decided to\r\nfall back, as they had penetrated far enough to prove that the passage of\r\nthe continent could be effected with a few more men. It was on the 27th\r\nof June that he began his homeward march, and on the 26th of August he\r\nreached Brodie's camp at Hamilton Springs, with the strength of all much\r\nreduced, and Stuart himself suffering from scurvy.\r\n\r\nAfter the result of Stuart's journey had been reported in Adelaide, and\r\nit was seen how inadequate means only had led to his defeat, the\r\nGovernment voted 2,500 pounds to equip a better-organized party; of this\r\nhe was to take command.\r\n\r\nStuart judged it best to keep his old track by way of the Finke and the\r\nHugh. On the 12th of April they arrived at the Bonney, and finding it\r\nrunning strong, with abundance of good feed on the banks, they were\r\nbetrayed into following it down; but it soon spread abroad and was lost\r\nin a large plain. Leaving the Bonney, they adhered to the old route, and\r\nreached Tennant's Creek on the 21st of April, and four days afterwards\r\nthey were on the scene of the attack that had been made on them at Attack\r\nCreek. But although the tracks of the natives were numerous, the\r\nexplorers were, at this time, permitted to pass on in peace. Keeping at\r\nthe foot of the low range, which there has an approximate northerly and\r\nsoutherly direction, Stuart crossed many creeks which promised long\r\ncourses where they formed in the range, but which were all alike lost\r\nwhen they reached the level country. On the 4th of May they attained to\r\nthe northern termination of this range, which he called the Ashburton\r\nRange. Here he made several attempts to the north and north-west, but\r\ncould discover neither water nor watercourses in those directions;\r\nnothing indeed but plains, beautifully grassed, but heavy to ride over\r\nand yielding under the horses' feet. Beyond these plains, the country\r\nchanged for the worse, and became sandy and scrubby. On the 16th of May\r\nhe encountered a new description of scrub that grew in a very obstructive\r\nmanner, and is now known as Stuart's Desert Hedgewood.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd he found a magnificent sheet of permanent water which he\r\ncalled the Newcastle Waters, and at first he judged that a clear way\r\nnorth was now assured. But he was deluded, for beyond these waters he\r\ncould not advance his party a mile; north, north-east, and north-west,\r\nthere was the one outlook -- endless grassy plains, terminating in dense\r\nscrubby forest country. He had to give up all hope for the present, and\r\nreturn to Adelaide.\r\n\r\nSuch however was the confidence of the authorities in him, and such his\r\nown energy, that in less than a month after his arrival in Adelaide he\r\nwas on his way to Chambers Creek to make preparations for a fresh\r\ndeparture. His last two journeys had proved the existence of a long line\r\nof good country, fairly well-watered; and although beyond it he had not\r\nbeen able to gain a footing, still there was no knowing what a fresh\r\nendeavour would bring to light.\r\n\r\nHe had brought his party back in safety, with the loss of only a few\r\nhorses, and had actually reached in point of position as low a latitude\r\nas the Victorian explorers had done, and that with a more difficult\r\ncountry to travel through, without camels, and with an inferior equipment\r\nin all other respects.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary again to follow Stuart's horse-tracks over the\r\nnorthern way he was now pursuing for the third time. On the 14th of\r\nApril, 1862, we find him encamped at the northern end of Newcastle\r\nWaters, once more about to force a passage through the forest of\r\nwaterless scrub to the north. On the second day he was partly successful,\r\nfinding an isolated waterhole, surrounded by conglomerate rocks. This he\r\ncalled Frew's Pond; and it is now a well-known camping-place for\r\ntravellers on the overland telegraph line.\r\n\r\nPast this spot he was not able to make any progress. Twice he made\r\nstrenuous but vain efforts to reach some tributary of the Victoria River.\r\nHe then spent many days riding through dense mulga and hedgewood scrub.\r\nAt length, after much hope deferred, finding a few scanty waterholes that\r\ndid not serve the purpose he had in view, he succeeded in striking the\r\nhead of a chain of ponds running in a northerly direction. These being\r\nfollowed down, led him to the head of the creek now called Daly Waters\r\nCreek, and finally to the large waterhole on which the present telegraph\r\nstation bearing the name of Daly Waters, stands. The creek was then lost\r\nin a swamp, and Stuart was unable to find the channel where it reformed,\r\nwhich has since been named the Birdum. Missing this water-guide, Stuart\r\nworked his way to the eastward, to a creek he named the Strangways, which\r\nled him down to the Roper River, a river which he had never striven to\r\nreach, his sole aim being the Victoria. He crossed the Roper, and\r\nfollowed up a northern tributary, which he named after his constant\r\nfriend John Chambers.\r\n\r\nScarcity of water was now a thing of the past, but his stock of spare\r\nhorseshoes had to be most jealously guarded, for his horses were\r\nbeginning to fall lame, the country he was on was very stony, and he was\r\nfar removed from Adelaide. From the Chambers he came to the lower course\r\nof a creek called by Leichhardt Flying-Fox Creek, re-named by Stuart the\r\nKatherine, the name it now bears. Thence he struck across the stony\r\ntableland and descended on the head waters of a river which he christened\r\nthe Adelaide, and on following this river down he found himself in rich\r\ntropical scenery, which told him that at last he was approaching the\r\nsea-shore.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July he turned a little to the north-east, intending to\r\nstrike the sea-beach and travel along it to the mouth of the Adelaide. He\r\ntold only two of the party of the eventful moment awaiting them. As they\r\nrode on, Thring, who was riding ahead, suddenly called out, \"The Sea,\"\r\nwhich so took the majority by surprise that they were some time before\r\nthey understood what was meant, and then three hearty cheers were given.\r\n\r\nAt this, his first point of contact with the ocean, Stuart dipped his\r\nfeet and hands in the sea, as at last he gazed across the water he had so\r\nperseveringly striven for years to reach.\r\n\r\nHe attempted to get to the mouth of the Adelaide River along the beach,\r\nbut found it too boggy for the horses. Wishing to husband the forces at\r\nhis command, Stuart wisely resolved to push no further; he had a space\r\ncleared where they were, and a tall sapling stripped of its boughs to\r\nserve as a flagstaff. On this he hoisted the Union Jack which he had\r\ncarried with him. A record of their arrival, contained in an air-tight\r\ncase, was then buried at the foot of the impromptu staff, and Stuart cut\r\nhis initials on the largest tree he could find. The tree has since been\r\nfound and recognised, but the buried memorial has not been discovered.\r\nMore fortunate than the ill-fated Burke, Stuart surveyed the open sea\r\nfrom his point of contact with the ocean, instead of having to be content\r\nwith some mangrove trees and salt water.\r\n\r\nMcDouall Stuart, whose last expedition we have thus followed out to its\r\nsuccessful end, is rightly considered the man to whom the credit for the\r\nfirst crossing the continent is due. His victory was all his own; he had\r\nfollowed in no other person's footsteps; he had crossed the true centre,\r\nand he had made the coast at a point much further to the north than that\r\nreached by Burke and Wills, their journey having been considerably\r\nshortened by its northern end being placed on the southern shore of the\r\ngreat gulf that bites so deeply into north Australia. Along Stuart's\r\ntrack there is now erected the Overland Telegraph Line, an enduring\r\nmonument to his indomitable perseverance.\r\n\r\nStuart's health was fast failing, and his horses were sadly reduced in\r\nstrength. He therefore started back the day after the consummation of his\r\ndearest ambition. On his way south, after leaving Newcastle Waters, he\r\nfound the water in many of the short creeks heading from the Ashburton\r\nRange to be rapidly diminishing; in some there was none left, in others\r\nit was fast drying. The horses commenced to give in rapidly one after the\r\nother, and more were lost on successive dry stages. Stuart himself\r\nthought that he would never live to see the settled districts. Scurvy had\r\nbrought him down to a lamentable state, and after all his hard-won\r\nsuccess, it seemed as though he would not profit by it. His right hand\r\nhad become useless to him, and his eyes lost power of sight after sunset.\r\nHe could not undergo the pain of riding, and a stretcher had to be slung\r\nbetween two horses to carry him on. With painful slowness they crept\r\nalong until they reached Mount Margaret, the first station. Here the\r\nleader, reduced to a mere skeleton, was furnished with a little relief;\r\nand after resting and gaining a little strength, he rode on to Adelaide.\r\n\r\nThis was Stuart's last expedition; for he never recovered his health nor\r\nformer eyesight. He was rewarded by the government of the colony which he\r\nhad served so well, and was awarded the gold medal of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society. He went to reside in England, where he died in the\r\nyear 1869, on the 16th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. BURKE AND WILLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Robert O'Hara Burke.

From a photo in possession of E.J.\r\nWelch, of the Howitt Relief Expedition.\r\n\r\nIllustration. John King. From a photo in the possession of E.J. Welch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to deal with an exploring expedition of greater notoriety\r\nthan that of any similar enterprise in the annals of Australia, though\r\nits results in the way of actual exploration in the true meaning of the\r\nterm were quite insignificant. The expedition could not reasonably hope\r\nto reveal any new geographical conditions; for the nature of the country\r\nto be traversed was fairly well-known: there was no such expanse of\r\nunknown territory along the suggested course of travel as to justify the\r\nanticipation of any discovery of magnitude. Both Kennedy and Gregory had\r\nfollowed much the same line of route when tracing the course of the\r\nBarcoo and Cooper's Creek, a short distance to the eastward. The only\r\napparent motive for the expedition seems to have been not particularly\r\ncreditable, the desire to outdo Stuart, who after nearly accomplishing\r\nthe task might well have been allowed the honour of completing it. But\r\nTime is after all the great arbitrator: Stuart re-entered Adelaide\r\nsuccessful, on the same day that the bodies of Burke and Wills arrived\r\nfor shipment to Melbourne.\r\n\r\nRobert O'Hara Burke was born in the county of Galway, in Ireland, in\r\n1821. He was the second son of John Hardiman Burke, of St. Clerans, and\r\nwas educated in Belgium. In 1840 he entered the Austrian army, in which\r\nhe rose to the rank of Captain. In 1848 he joined the Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary, but five years later emigrated to Tasmania. Thence he went\r\nto Victoria, where he entered the local police force, and became an\r\nInspector. Such was his position when he was offered the command of the\r\nexpedition which ended in his death.\r\n\r\nWilliam John Wills was born at Totnes, in Devonshire. He was the son of a\r\nmedical man, and after his arrival in Victoria, in 1852, he led for a\r\ntime a bush life on the Edwards River. He was later employed as a\r\nsurveyor in Melbourne, and then became assistant to Professor Neumayer at\r\nthe Melbourne Observatory, a post he quitted in order to act as\r\nassistant-surveyor on the ill-starred journey.\r\n\r\nSentiment, and an hysterical sentiment at that, seems to have dominated\r\nthis expedition throughout. There was no urgent necessity for Victoria to\r\nequip and send forth an exploring expedition. Her rich and compact little\r\nprovince was known from end to end, and she had no surplus territory in\r\nwhich to open up fresh fields of pastoral occupation for her sons. But\r\nher people became possessed with the exploring spirit, and the planning\r\nand execution of the scheme was a signal indication of national\r\npatriotism. And if sense and not sentiment had marked the counsel, the\r\nresults might have conferred rich benefit upon Australia.\r\n\r\nThe necessary funds were made up as follows: 6,000 pounds voted by\r\nGovernment; 1,000 pounds presented by Mr. Ambrose Kyte; and the balance\r\nof the first expenditure of 12,000 pounds made up by public subscription.\r\nBut the final cost of the expedition and of the relief parties amounted\r\nto 57,000 pounds. And the exploratory work done by the different relief\r\nparties far and away exceeded in geographical results the small amount\r\neffected by the original expedition.\r\n\r\nA committee of management was appointed, and to his interest with this\r\ncommittee Burke owed his elevation to the position of leader. He seems to\r\nhave been supported by that sort of general testimony which fits a man to\r\napply for nearly any position; but of special aptitude and training for\r\nthe work to be done he had none. He was frank, openhearted, impetuous,\r\nand endowed with all those qualities which made him a great favourite\r\nwith women; moreover, his service in the Austrian army had given people\r\nan exaggerated notion of his ability to command and organize. It would\r\nappear on the whole that his appointment was due solely to the influence\r\nhe wielded, and to his personal popularity.\r\n\r\nWills appears to have been a man gifted with many of the qualities\r\nessential for efficient discharge of the duties and responsibilities\r\nappertaining to the post he held; but his amiable disposition allowed him\r\nto be influenced too readily in council by the rash and foolish judgment\r\nof his impetuous superior. If, for instance, he had persisted in\r\ncombating Burke's incomprehensible plan of leaving the depot for Mount\r\nHopeless, the last fatality would never have occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen the expedition left Melbourne, it was amid the shouts and hurrahs of\r\nacclaiming thousands, who probably had not the faintest idea of the easy\r\ntask that the explorers with their imposing retinue and outfit had before\r\nthem. In fact, with all the resources at Burke's command, a favourable\r\nseason and good open country, the excursion would have been a mere picnic\r\nto most men of experience. A number of camels had been specially imported\r\nfrom India at a cost of 5,500 pounds. G.J. Landells came to the country\r\nin charge of them, and had been appointed second in command. Long before\r\nthey left the settled districts, Burke quarrelled with him, whereupon he\r\nresigned and returned to Melbourne. There he openly declared that under\r\nBurke's control the expedition would assuredly meet with disaster. Wills\r\nwas then appointed second by Burke, and Wright, who was supposed to be\r\nacquainted with the locality which they were approaching, was engaged as\r\nthird, another most unfortunate selection. Besides those already\r\nmentioned, there were Dr. Hermann Beckler, medical officer and botanist,\r\nand Dr. Ludwig Becker, artist, naturalist, and geologist, ten white\r\nassistants, and three camel-drivers.\r\n\r\nThe expedition in full reached Menindie on the Darling, where Wright\r\njoined them. On the 19th of October, 1860, Burke, Wills, six men, five\r\nhorses and sixteen camels, left Menindie for Cooper's Creek. Wright went\r\nwith them two hundred miles to indicate the best route, and then returned\r\nto take charge of the main body waiting at Menindie. On the 11th of\r\nNovember, Burke with the advance party reached Cooper's Creek, where they\r\ncamped and awaited the arrival of Wright with the rest. Grass and water\r\nwere both plentiful, and the journey had hitherto proved no more arduous\r\nthan an ordinary over-landing trip.\r\n\r\nThe long delay and inaction worked sadly upon Burke's active and\r\nimpatient temperament, and he suddenly announced his intention to\r\nsubdivide his party and, with three men, to start across the belt of\r\nunknown country -- a distance of five hundred miles at the furthest --\r\nthat separated him from Gregory's track round the Gulf. Although his\r\nlavish outfit had been purchased specially to explore this comparatively\r\nsmall extent of land, he thus deliberately left it behind him during the\r\nmost critical part of the journey. He had with him no means of following\r\nup any discoveries he might make, and his botanist and naturalist and\r\ngeologist were also left behind. He killed time for a little while by\r\nmaking short excursions northward, and then, on the 16th of December,\r\nimpatient of further delay, he started with Wills and two men for\r\nCarpentaria. The others were left, with verbal instructions, to wait\r\nthree months for him. Thus, dispersed and neglected, he left the costly\r\nequipment containing within itself all the elements of successful\r\ngeographical research. Certainly this was not the plan that had been\r\nanticipated by the promoters and organisers. We have now, at this stage,\r\nthe spectacle of the main body loitering on the outskirts of the settled\r\ndistricts, four men killing time on the banks of Cooper's Creek, and the\r\nleader and three others scampering across the continent, all four of them\r\nutterly inexperienced in bushcraft.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected the results of the journey are most barren:\r\nWills's diary is sadly uninteresting, and Burke made only a few scanty\r\nnotes, at the end of which he writes: \"28th March. At the conclusion of\r\nreport it would be as well to say that we reached the sea, but we could\r\nnot obtain a view of the open ocean, although we made every endeavour to\r\ndo so.\"\r\n\r\nShortly condensing Wills's diary, we gather the following account of\r\ntheir route. The first point they intended to reach was Eyre's Creek, but\r\nbefore arriving at it, they discovered a fine watercourse coming from the\r\nnorth, which took them a long distance in the direction they desired to\r\nfollow. This watercourse, which McKinlay afterwards called the Mueller,\r\nbegan in time to lead their steps too much to the eastward, in which\r\ndirection lay its source. They therefore quitted it and kept due north,\r\nfollowing a tributary well-supplied with both grass and water. This\r\ntributary led them well on to the northern dividing range, which they\r\ncrossed without difficulty, coming down on to the head of the Cloncurry\r\nRiver. By tracing that river down they reached the Flinders River, which\r\nthey followed down to the mangroves and salt water. They were, however,\r\nconsiderably out in their longitude, for they thought that they were on\r\nthe Albert, over one hundred miles to the westward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Scenes on Cooper's Creek (After Howitt).\r\n1. Burke's Grave.\r\n2. Where King was Found.\r\n3. Grave of Wills.]\r\n\r\nHaving sighted salt water, if not the open sea, they commenced the\r\nretreat. Gray and King were the two men who were with Burke and Wills;\r\nand for equipment they had started with six camels, one horse, and three\r\nmonths' provisions. Short rations and fatiguing marches now began to\r\ntell, and during the struggle back to the Depot, there seems to have been\r\nan absence of that kindly spirit of comradeship that has so often\r\ndistinguished other exploring expeditions fallen on evil days.\r\n\r\nGray became ill, and took some extra flour to make a little gruel with.\r\nFor this infringement of rules, Burke personally chastised him. A few\r\ndays afterwards, Wills wrote in his diary that they had to halt and send\r\nback for Gray, who was \"gammoning\" that he could not walk. Nine days\r\nafterwards the unfortunate man died, an act which is not often\r\nsuccessfully \"gammoned.\"\r\n\r\nBut to bring the miserable story to an end, at last on the evening of the\r\n21st of April, 1861, two months after they had reached the Gulf, they\r\nre-entered the depot camp at Cooper's Creek, where four men had been\r\ninstructed to await their return, only to find it deserted and lifeless.\r\nKeenly disappointed, for though they knew they were behind the appointed\r\ntime, they had still hoped that some one would have waited for them, they\r\nsearched the locality for some sign or message from their friends, and on\r\na tree saw the word DIG carved. Beneath this message of hope they were\r\nsoon busy digging, and before long they unearthed a welcome store of\r\nprovisions and a letter, which ran:--\r\n\r\nDepot, Cooper's Creek, April 21, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe depot party of V.E.E.* leaves this camp to-day to return to the\r\nDarling. I intend to go South-East from Camp 60 to get on our old track\r\nat Bulloo. Two of my companions and myself are quite well; the third --\r\nPatton -- has been unable to walk for the last eighteen days as his leg\r\nhas been severely hurt when thrown by one of the horses. No person has\r\nbeen up here from the Darling. We have six camels and twelve horses in\r\ngood working condition.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BRAHE.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote] Victorian Exploration Expedition.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this was so worded that when Burke found it the same\r\nnight, it gave him the impression that the depot party were all, with one\r\nexception, fairly well; and that, with fresh animals just off a long rest\r\nthey would travel long stages on their homeward march. As a matter of\r\nfact, on the evening of the day that Burke returned, they were camped but\r\nfourteen miles away. But this was only the first of a series of singular\r\nand fatal oversights -- that almost seemed pre-ordained by mocking Fate.\r\n\r\nBurke consulted his companions as to the feasibility of their overtaking\r\nBrahe, and they both agreed that, in their tired and enfeebled condition,\r\nit was hopeless to attempt it. Burke proposed that instead of returning\r\nup the creek along the old route to Menindie, they should follow the\r\ncreek down to Mount Hopeless in South Australia, following the route\r\ntaken by A.C. Gregory.* Wills objected to this, and so did King, but\r\nultimately both gave in, thereby signing their death warrant; for if they\r\nhad remained quietly at the depot, they would have been rescued.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 18.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for five days, and finding their strength much restored by\r\nthe food, they started for Mount Hopeless, ill-omened name. Before they\r\nleft, Burke placed in the cache a paper, stating that they had returned,\r\nand then carefully restored the ground to its former condition. The\r\ncommon and natural thought to mark a tree or to make some other\r\nunmistakable sign of their return, does not seem to have occurred to\r\neither of the leaders. It will be seen further on how this scarcely\r\ncredible omission was a main factor in deciding their fate.\r\n\r\nAs they progressed slowly down the creek, one of the two camels became\r\nbogged, and had to be shot where it lay. The wanderers cut off what meat\r\nthere was on the body, and stayed two or three days to dry it in the sun.\r\nThe one camel had now to carry what they had, except the bundles that the\r\nmen bore, each some twenty-five pounds in weight. They made but little\r\nprogress; the creek split up into many channels that ran out into earthy\r\nplains; and at last, when their one beast of burden gave in, they had to\r\nacknowledge defeat, and commenced to return. After shooting the wretched\r\ncamel and drying his flesh, the men tried to live like the blacks, on\r\nfish and nardoo, the seeds of a small plant of which the natives make\r\nflour. But the struggle for existence was very hard; they were not expert\r\nhunters, and the natives, who were at first friendly and shared their\r\nfood with them, soon out-grew the novelty of their presence, began to\r\nfind them an encumbrance, and constantly shifted camp to avoid the burden\r\nof their support.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May, Wills went forward alone to visit the depot and\r\ndeposit there the journals and a note stating their condition. He reached\r\nthere on the 30th and wrote in his diary that \"No traces of anyone,\r\nexcept blacks have been here since we left.\"\r\n\r\nBut while they were absent down the creek, Brahe and Wright had visited\r\nthe place, and finding no sign of their return, and the cache apparently\r\nuntouched, had ridden away concluding that they had not yet come back.\r\nThis was the note that Wills left:--\r\n\r\nMay 30th, 1861. We have been unable to leave the creek. Both camels are\r\ndead. Burke and King are down on the lower part of the creek. I am about\r\nto return to them, when we shall probably all come up here. We are trying\r\nto live the best way we can, like the blacks, but we find it hard work.\r\nOur clothes are going fast to pieces; send provisions and clothes as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe depot party having left contrary to instructions has put us into this\r\nfix. I have deposited some of my journals here for fear of accidents.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. WILLS.\r\n\r\nHaving done this, and once more carefully concealed all traces of the\r\ncache having been disturbed, Wills rejoined his companions in misfortune.\r\nSome friendly natives fed him on his way back to them.\r\n\r\nDuring the intercourse that of necessity they had with the natives along\r\nCooper's Creek, they had noticed the extensive use made by them of the\r\nseeds of the nardoo plant; but for a long time they had been unable to\r\nfind this plant, nor would the blacks show it to them. At last King\r\naccidentally found it, and by its aid they managed to prolong their\r\nlives. But the seeds had to be gathered, cleaned, pounded and cooked; and\r\nin comparison with all this labour the nourishment afforded by the cakes\r\nwas very slight. An occasional crow or hawk was shot, and a little fish\r\nnow and then begged from the natives. As they were sinking rapidly, it\r\nwas at last decided that Burke and King should go up the creek and\r\nendeavour to find the main camp of the natives and obtain food from them.\r\nWills, who was now so weak as to be unable to move, was left lying under\r\nsome boughs, with an eight days' supply of nardoo and water, the others\r\ntrusting that within that period they would have returned to him.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June the two men started, and poor Wills was left to meet\r\ndeath alone. By the entries in his diary, which he kept written up as\r\nlong as his strength remained, he evidently retained consciousness almost\r\nto the last. So exhausted was he that death must have come to him as a\r\nmerciful release from the pain of living. His last entries, although\r\ngiving evidence of fading faculties, are almost cheerful. He jocularly\r\nalludes to himself as Micawber, waiting for something to turn up. But it\r\nis evident that he had given up hope, and was waiting for death's\r\napproach, calm and resigned, without fear, like a good and gallant man.\r\n\r\nBurke and King did not advance far. On the second day Burke had to give\r\nin from sheer weakness; the next morning when his companion looked at him\r\nhe saw by the breaking light that his leader was dead.\r\n\r\nThe last entries in Burke's pocket-book run thus:--\r\n\r\n\"I hope we shall be done justice to. We have fulfilled our task but have\r\nbeen aban----. We have not been followed up as we expected, and the depot\r\nparty abandoned their post...King has behaved nobly. He has stayed with\r\nme to the last, and placed the pistol in my hand, leaving me lying on the\r\nsurface as I wished.\"\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, King wandered about in search of the natives, and, not\r\nfinding them, the lonely man returned to the spot where they had left\r\nWills, and found that his troubles too were over. He covered up the\r\ncorpse with a little sand, and then left once more in search of the\r\nnatives. This time he found them, and, moved by his solitary condition,\r\nthey helped him to live until rescued by Howitt's party on September\r\n15th.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Edwin J. Welch, second in command of the Howitt Relief\r\nExpedition, and the first man to find King.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the absence of any news from Wright, in charge of the main\r\nbody, was beginning to create a feeling of uneasiness in Melbourne. A\r\nlight party had already been equipped under A.W. Howitt to follow up\r\nBurke's tracks, when suddenly despatches from the Darling arrived from\r\nWright, telling of the non-arrival of the four men. Howitt's party was\r\ndoubled, and he was immediately sent off to Cooper's Creek to commence a\r\nsearch for the missing men. He had not far to go. On the 13th of\r\nSeptember he arrived at the fateful depot camp on Cooper's Creek, with\r\nBrahe. He immediately commenced to follow, or try to follow, Burke's\r\noutward track, but on Sunday the 15th, while still on Cooper's Creek,\r\nKing was found by E.J. Welch, the second in command of the relief party.\r\nWelch's account of the finding of King is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"After travelling about three miles, my attention was attracted by a\r\nnumber of niggers on the opposite bank of the creek, who shouted loudly\r\nas soon as they saw me, and vigorously waved and pointed down the creek.\r\nA feeling of something about to happen excited me somewhat, but I little\r\nexpected what the sequel was to be. Moving cautiously on through the\r\nundergrowth which lined the banks of the creek, the blacks kept pace on\r\nthe opposite side, their cries increasing in volume and intensity; when\r\nsuddenly rounding a bend I was startled to see a large body of them\r\ngathered on a sandy neck in the bed of the creek, between two large\r\nwaterholes. Immediately they saw me, they too commenced to howl and wave\r\ntheir weapons in the air. I at once pulled up, and considered the\r\npropriety of waiting the arrival of the party, for I felt far from\r\nsatisfied with regard to their intentions. But here, for the first time,\r\nmy favourite horse -- a black cob known in the camp as Piggy, a Murray\r\nDowns bred stock-horse of good repute both for foot and temper --\r\nappeared to think that his work was cut out for him, and the time had\r\narrived in which to do it. Pawing and snorting at the noise, he suddenly\r\nslewed round and headed down the steep bank, through the undergrowth,\r\nstraight for the crowd as he had been wont to do after many a mob of\r\nweaners on his native plains. The blacks drew hurriedly back to the top\r\nof the opposite bank, shouting and gesticulating violently, and leaving\r\none solitary figure apparently covered with some scarecrow rags and part\r\nof a hat prominently alone in the sand. Before I could pull up I had\r\npassed it, and as I passed it tottered, threw up its hands in the\r\nattitude of prayer and fell on the sand. The heavy sand helped me to\r\nconquer Piggy on the level, and when I turned back, the figure had\r\npartially risen.\r\n\r\n\"Hastily dismounting, I was soon beside it, excitedly asking: 'Who in the\r\nname of wonder are you?' He answered, 'I am King, sir.' For the moment I\r\ndid not grasp the thought that the object of our search was attained, for\r\nKing being only one of the undistinguished members of the party, his name\r\nwas unfamiliar to me.\r\n\r\n\"'King,' I repeated. 'Yes,' he said; 'the last man of the exploring\r\nexpedition.' 'What! Burke's?' 'Yes,' he said. 'Where is he -- and Wills?'\r\n'Dead, both dead, long ago,' and again he fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Then I knew who stood before me. Jumping into the saddle and riding up\r\nthe bank, I fired two or three revolver shots to attract the attention of\r\nthe party, and on their coming up, sent the other black boy to cut\r\nHowitt's track and bring him back to camp. We then put up a tent to\r\nshelter the rescued man, and by degrees we got from him the sad story of\r\nthe death of his leader. We got it at intervals only, between the long\r\nrests which his exhausted condition compelled him to take.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as King had recovered enough strength to accompany the party,\r\nthey went to the place where Wills had breathed his last; and found his\r\nbody in the gunyah as King had described it. There it was buried. On the\r\n21st Burke's body was found up the creek; he too was at first buried\r\nwhere he died. Howitt, after rewarding the blacks who had cared for King,\r\nstarted back for Melbourne by easy stages. On his arrival there he was\r\nsent back to disinter the remains of the dead; a task which he and Welch\r\nsafely accomplished, bringing the bodies down by way of Adelaide.\r\n\r\nDr. Becker, Stone, Purcell, and Patton were the others whose lives were\r\nsacrificed on this expedition, so marked with disaster. These victims\r\nreceived no token of public recognition of their fate, although a public\r\nfuneral was accorded to Burke and Wills, and a statue has been erected to\r\ntheir memory in Melbourne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. The Burke and Wills Statue, Melbourne.]\r\n\r\nThe foolish and unaccountable oversight of Burke and his companions in\r\nnot marking a tree, or otherwise leaving some recognisable sign of their\r\nreturn at the depot, seems to have led Brahe astray completely. He states\r\nhis side of the case as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Burke's return being so soon after my departure caused the tracks of\r\nhis camels to correspond in the character of age exactly with our own\r\ntracks. The remains of three separate fires led us to suppose that blacks\r\nhad been camped there...The ground above the cache was so perfectly\r\nrestored to the appearance it presented when I left it, that in the\r\nabsence of any fresh sign or mark of any description to be seen near, it\r\nwas impossible to suppose that it had been disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the lost explorers created intense excitement throughout the\r\nother colonies. Queensland, as the colony wherein the explorers were\r\nsupposed to have met with disaster, sent out two search parties. The\r\nVictoria, a steam sloop, was sent up to the mouth of the Albert River in\r\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria, having on board William Landsborough, with\r\nGeorge Bourne as second in command, and a small and efficient party;\r\nanother Queensland expedition, under Fred Walker, left the furthest\r\nstation in the Rockhampton district; and from South Australia John\r\nMcKinlay started to traverse the continent on much the same line of route\r\nas that taken by the unhappy men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. THE RELIEF EXPEDITIONS AND ATTEMPTS TOWARDS PERTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n15.1. JOHN MCKINLAY.\r\n\r\nJohn McKinlay was born at Sandbank, on the Clyde, in 1819. He first came\r\nto the colony of New South Wales in 1836, and joined his uncle, a\r\nprosperous grazier, under whose guidance he soon became a good bushman\r\nwith an ardent love of bush life. He took up several runs near the South\r\nAustralian border, and thenceforth became associated with that province.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 he was appointed leader of the South Australian relief party and\r\nstarted from Adelaide on October 26th. On arriving at Blanche Water, he\r\nheard a vague rumour from the blacks that white men and camels had been\r\nseen at a distant inland water; but put little faith in the story. He\r\ntraversed Lake Torrens, and, striking north, crossed the lower end of\r\nCooper's Creek at a point where the main watercourse is lost in a maze of\r\nchannels. Here he learned definite and particular details respecting the\r\nrumoured white men, and thinking there might be some groundwork of truth\r\nin the report, he now pressed forward to the locality indicated. Having\r\nformed a depot camp, he went ahead with two white men and a native.\r\nPassing through a belt of country with numerous small shallow lakelets,\r\nthey came to a watercourse whereon they found signs of a grave, and they\r\npicked up a battered pint-pot. Next morning, feeling sure that the ground\r\nhad been disturbed with a spade, they opened what proved to be a grave,\r\nand in it found the body of a European, the skull marked, so McKinlay\r\nstates, with two sabre cuts. He noted down the description of the body,\r\nthe locality, and its surroundings; and in view of these particulars, it\r\nhas been stated that the body was that of Gray, who died in the\r\nneighbourhood.*\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 14.\r\n\r\nConsidering the minute and circumstantial accounts that have from time to\r\ntime been related by the blacks concerning Leichhardt, one is not\r\nastonished at the legends told to McKinlay. The native with him told him\r\nthat the whites had been attacked in their camp, and that the whole of\r\nthem had been murdered; the blacks having finished by eating the bodies\r\nof the other men, and burying the journals, saddles, and similar portions\r\nof the equipment beside a lake a short distance away. A further search\r\nrevealed another grave -- empty -- and there were other and slighter\r\nindications that white men had visited the neighbourhood, so that\r\nMcKinlay was led to place some credence in this story.\r\n\r\nNext morning a tribe of blacks appeared; and although they immediately\r\nran away on perceiving the party, one was captured who corroborated the\r\nstatement made by the other native. Both of them bore marks on them like\r\nbullet and shot wounds. The second native said that there was a pistol\r\nconcealed near a neighbouring lake. He was sent to fetch it; but returned\r\nthe next morning at the head of a host of aboriginals, armed, painted,\r\nand evidently bent on mischief. The leader was obliged to order his men\r\nto fire upon them, and it was only after two or three volleys that they\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nMcKinlay was now satisfied that he had discovered all there was to find\r\nof the Victorian expedition, and, after burying a letter for the benefit\r\nof any after-comers, he left Lake Massacre, as it was mistakenly named,\r\nand returned to the depot camp. His letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"S.A.B.R. Expedition,\r\n\r\n\"October 23rd, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"To the leader of any expedition seeking tidings of Burke and party.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I reached this water on the 19th instant, and by means of a native\r\nguide discovered a European camp, one mile north on west side of flat. At\r\nor near this camp, traces of horses, camels, and whites were found. Hair,\r\napparently belonging to Mr. Wills, Charles Gray, Mr. Burke, or King, was\r\npicked up from the surface of a grave dug by a spade, and from the skull\r\nof a European buried by the natives. Other less important traces -- such\r\nas a pannikin, oil-can, saddle-stuffing, etc., have been found. Beware of\r\nthe natives, on whom we have had to fire. We do not intend to return to\r\nAdelaide, but proceed to west of north. From information, all Burke's\r\nparty were killed and eaten.\r\n\r\n\"JNO. MCKINLAY.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. All the party in good health.\r\n\r\n\"If you had any difficulty in reaching this spot, and wish to return to\r\nAdelaide by a more practicable route, you may do so for at least three\r\nmonths to come by driving west eighteen miles, then south of west,\r\ncutting our dray track within thirty miles. Abundance of water and feed\r\nat easy stages.\"\r\n\r\nMcKinlay next sent one of his party -- Hodgkinson -- with men and\r\npack-horses to Blanche Water, to carry down the news of his discovery,\r\nand to bring back rations for a prolonged exploration. Meanwhile he\r\nremained in camp. From one old native with whom he had a long\r\nconversation, he obtained another version of the alleged massacre, in\r\nwhich there was apparently some vestige of truth.\r\n\r\nThe new version was to the effect that the whites, on their return, had\r\nbeen attacked by the natives, but had repulsed them. One white man had\r\nbeen killed, and had been buried after the fight, whilst the other whites\r\nwent south. The natives had then dug up the body and eaten the flesh. The\r\nold fellow also described minutely the different waters passed by Burke,\r\nand the way in which the men subsisted on the seeds of the nardoo plant,\r\nall of which he must have heard from other natives.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a month, Hodgkinson returned, bringing the news of the\r\nrescue of King and the fate of Burke and Wills. This explained McKinlay's\r\ndiscovery as that of Gray's body, the narrative of the fight and massacre\r\nbeing merely ornamental additions by the natives. After an easterly\r\nexcursion, in which he visited the two graves on Cooper's Creek, McKinlay\r\nstarted definitely north. It is difficult to follow without a map the\r\nJournal containing the record of his travel during the first weeks. Not\r\nonly does he give the native name of every small lakelet and waterhole in\r\nfull, but he omits to give the bearing of his daily course.\r\n\r\nA northerly course was however, in the main pursued, and Mckinlay\r\ndescribes the country crossed as first-class pastoral land. As it was\r\nthen the dry season of the year, immediately preceding the rains, it\r\nproves what an abnormally severe season must have been encountered by\r\nSturt when that explorer was turned back on his last trip in much the\r\nsame latitude. On the 27th of February, the wet season of the tropics set\r\nin; but fortunately the party found a refuge among some stony hills and\r\nsand-ridges, in the neighbourhood of which they were camped, though at\r\none time they were completely surrounded by water. On March 10th, the\r\nrain had abated sufficiently to allow them to resume their journey; but\r\nthe main creek which they still continued to follow up north was so boggy\r\nand swollen that they were forced to keep some distance from its banks.\r\nThis river, which McKinlay called the Mueller, is one of the main rivers\r\nof Central Australia, and an important affluent of Lake Eyre, and is now\r\nknown as the Diamantina. McKinlay left it at the point where it comes\r\nfrom the north-west, and following up a tributary, he crossed the\r\ndividing range, there called the McKinlay Range, in about the same\r\nlocality as Burke's crossing. He had christened many of the inland\r\nwatercourses on his way across, but most of his names have been replaced\r\nby others, it having been difficult subsequently to identify them. In\r\nmany cases, the watercourses which he thought to be independent creeks,\r\nare but ana-branches of the Diamantina.\r\n\r\nPassing through good travelling country, and finding ample grass and\r\nwater, he reached the Leichhardt River flowing into the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria, on the 6th of May.\r\n\r\nAs his rations were becoming perilously low, McKinlay was anxious to get\r\nto the mouth of the Albert, it having been understood that Captain\r\nNorman, with the steam-ship Victoria was there to form a depot for the\r\nuse of the Queensland search parties. His attempts to reach it however,\r\nwere fruitless, as he was continually turned back by mangrove creeks both\r\nbroad and deep, and by boggy flats; so that on the 21st of May he started\r\nfor the nearest settled district in North Queensland, in the direction of\r\nPort Denison.\r\n\r\nHe followed much the same route as that taken by A.C. Gregory on his\r\nreturn from the Victoria River.* Crossing on to the head of the Burdekin,\r\nhe followed that river down, trusting to come across some of the flocks\r\nand herds of the advancing settlers. On reaching Mount McConnell, where\r\nthe two former explorers had crossed the Burdekin, he continued to follow\r\nthe river, and descended the coast range where it forces its way through\r\na narrow gorge. Here on the Bowen River, he arrived at a temporary\r\nstation just formed by Phillip Somer, where he received all the\r\naccustomed hospitality. Since leaving the Gulf, the explorers had\r\nsubsisted on little else but horse and camel flesh, and were necessarily\r\nin a weak condition. Had they but camped a day or two when on the upper\r\ncourse of the Burdekin, they would have been relieved much earlier, for\r\nthe pioneer squatters were already there, and the party would have been\r\nspared a rough trip through the Burdekin Gorge. In fact the tracks of the\r\ncamels were seen by one pioneer at least, a few hours after the caravan\r\nhad passed. E. Cunningham, who had just then formed Burdekin Downs\r\nstation, tells with much amusement how McKinlay's tracks puzzled him and\r\nhis black boy. The Burdekin pioneers did not of course, expect McKinlay's\r\nadvent amongst them, although they knew that he was then somewhere out\r\nwest; and such an animal as a camel did not enter into their\r\ncalculations. Cunningham said that the only solution of the problem of\r\nthe footprints that he could think of was that the tracks were those of a\r\nreturn party who had been looking for new country, and that their horses,\r\nhaving lost their shoes and becoming footsore, they had wrapped their\r\nfeet in bandages.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 18.\r\n\r\nFor his services on this expedition which were of great value in opening\r\nup Central Australia, McKinlay was presented with a gold watch by the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society, and was voted 1,000 pounds by the South\r\nAustralian Government.\r\n\r\nDuring the early settlement of the Northern Territory, much\r\ndissatisfaction had arisen concerning the site chosen at Escape Cliffs.\r\nMcKinlay was sent north by the South Australian Government to select a\r\nmore favourable position, and to report generally on the capabilities of\r\nthe new territory. He organized an expedition at Escape Cliffs, and left\r\nwith the intention of making a long excursion to the eastward. But a very\r\nwet season set in, and he had reached only the East Alligator River when\r\nsudden floods cut him off and hemmed him in. The whole party would have\r\nbeen destroyed but for the resourcefulness displayed by the leader, who\r\nmade coracles of horse-hides stretched on frames of saplings, by which\r\nmeans they escaped. On his return, McKinlay examined the mouth of the\r\nDaly River, and recommended Anson Bay as a more suitable site, but his\r\nsuggestion was not adopted. McKinlay, whose health suffered from the\r\neffect of the hardships incident to his journeys, retired to spend his\r\ndays in the congenial atmosphere of pastoral pursuits, and died, in 1874,\r\nat Gawler, South Australia, where a monument is erected to his memory.\r\n\r\n15.2. WILLIAM LANDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nWilliam Landsborough, the son of a Scotch physician, was born in Ayrshire\r\nand educated at Irvine. When he came to Australia, he settled first in\r\nthe New England district of New South Wales, and thence removed to\r\nQueensland. In 1856, his interest in discovery and a desire to find new\r\ncountry led him to undertake much private exploration, principally on the\r\ncoastal parts of Queensland, in the district of Broadsound and the Isaacs\r\nRiver. In 1858 he explored the Comet to its head, and in the following\r\nyear the head waters of the Thomson.\r\n\r\nAn old friend and erstwhile comrade, writing of him, says:\r\n\"Landsborough's enterprise was entirely founded on self-reliance. He had\r\nneither Government aid nor capitalists at his back when he achieved his\r\nfirst success as an explorer. He was the very model of a pioneer --\r\ncourageous, hardy, good-humoured, and kindly. He was an excellent\r\nhorseman, a most entertaining and, at times, eccentric companion, and he\r\ncould starve with greater cheerfulness than any man I ever saw or heard\r\nof. But, excellent fellow though he was, his very independence of\r\ncharacter and success in exploring provoked much ill-will.\"\r\n\r\nLandsborough was recommended for the position of leader by the veteran\r\nA.C. Gregory, and on the 14th of August he left Brisbane in the Firefly,\r\nhaving on board a party of volunteer assistants who had been stirred by\r\nthe widespread sympathy with the missing men to take an active part in\r\nthe relief expedition. Unfortunately, those under Landsborough were, with\r\none exception, unacquainted with bush life. The exception was George\r\nBourne, the second in command, an old squatter who had seen and suffered\r\nmany a long drought, and whose services proved to be of great value.\r\nAfter some mishap the Firefly, convoyed by the Victoria, reached the\r\nmouth of the Albert River, where the party was safely landed.\r\n\r\nAfter starting from the Albert, Landsborough came unexpectedly upon a\r\nriver hitherto unknown. It flowed into the Nicholson, and both Leichhardt\r\nand Gregory had crossed below the confluence. It was a running stream\r\nwith much semi-tropical foliage on its banks, running through\r\nwell-grassed, level country, and he named it the Gregory. As they neared\r\nthe higher reaches of the Gregory, they found the country of a more arid\r\nnature. They ascended the main range, and on the 21st of December,\r\nLandsborough found an inland river flowing south, which he named the\r\nHerbert. The Queensland authorities subsequently re-christened the stream\r\nwith the singularly inappropriate name of Georgina. In this river two\r\nfine sheets of water were found, and called Lake Frances and Lake Mary.\r\nAn ineffectual attempt was then made to go westward, but lack of water\r\ncompelled them to desist.\r\n\r\nLandsborough now returned to the depot by way of the Gregory, and, on\r\narriving there, learnt that Walker had been in and had reported having\r\nseen the tracks of Burke and Wills on the Flinders. Landsborough\r\nthereupon resolved to return by way of the Flinders, instead of going\r\nback by boat. They had very little provisions, but by reducing the number\r\nof the party, they managed to subsist on short allowance. On this second\r\ntrip, he followed the Flinders up, and was rewarded by being the first\r\nwhite man to see the beautiful prairie-like country through which it\r\nflows. He named the remarkable isolated hills visible from the river Fort\r\nBowen, Mount Brown and Mount Little. From the upper Flinders he struck\r\nsouth, hoping to come across a newly-formed station, but was\r\ndisappointed, though he saw numerous horse-tracks showing that settlement\r\nwas near at hand. At last after enduring a long period of\r\nsemi-starvation, they reached the Warrego, and at the station of Neilson\r\nand Williams, first learnt the fate of those whom they had been seeking.\r\n\r\nLandsborough was next appointed Resident at Burketown, and afterwards\r\nInspector of Brands for the district of East Moreton. He died in 1886.\r\n\r\n15.3. P.E. WARBURTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Major Warburton.]\r\n\r\nMajor Warburton was the fourth son of the Reverend Rowland Warburton of\r\nArley Hall, Cheshire, where he was born on the 15th of August, 1813. He\r\nwas first educated in France. He entered the Royal Navy in 1826, and in\r\n1829 proceeded to Addiscombe College, preparatory to entering the East\r\nIndia Company's service, in which he served from 1831 to 1853, when he\r\nretired with the rank of Major. In 1853 he arrived at Albany. From there\r\nhe went on to Adelaide, and at the end of the same year was appointed\r\nCommissioner of Police, an office which he held until he was placed in\r\ncharge of the Imperial Pension Department. On his return from his\r\nexploring expedition he was voted 1,000 pounds for himself, and 500\r\npounds for his party. He was created a C.M.G. in 1875, was awarded the\r\nGold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London, and he died in\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 two prominent South Australian colonists, whose names are\r\nintimately connected with the promotion of exploration in that colony,\r\nThomas Elder and Walter Hughes, fitted out an expedition which it was\r\nhoped would lead to the rapid advancement of geographical knowledge.\r\nUnfortunately the result was not commensurate with the ambitious nature\r\nof the undertaking. The command was given to Major Warburton, who was\r\ninstructed to start from the neighbourhood of Central Mount Stuart, and\r\nto steer a course direct to Perth. In spite of being provided with a long\r\nstring of camels, Warburton incurred so much delay in getting through the\r\nsandhills that his camels were knocked up and his provisions nearly all\r\nconsumed before he had advanced half-way. This compelled him to bear up\r\nnorth to the head waters of the Oakover River. Besides the leader, the\r\nparty consisted of his son Richard; Lewis, a surveyor; one more white\r\nman; two Afghans; and a native. Lewis, the surveyor, showed himself to be\r\na most capable man; in fact, but for his energy and forethought, the\r\nexpedition would have been swallowed up in the sands of the north-west\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of April, 1873, the explorers left Alice Springs and followed\r\nthe overland line until they reached a creek called Burt's Creek, whence\r\nthey struck to the westward. After a vain search for the rivers Hugh and\r\nFinke, which were popularly supposed to rise to the north of the\r\nMcDonnell Ranges, Warburton altered his course to the north-west, meaning\r\nto connect with A.C. Gregory's most southerly point on Sturt's Creek. For\r\nsome distance his way led him through available pastoral country, and in\r\nsome of the minor ranges beautiful glens were discovered with deep pools\r\nof water in their beds. So frightened were the camels by the rocks that\r\nsurrounded them, that they would not approach them to drink. On the 22nd\r\nof May, after travelling for some days in poor sandy country, they came\r\nto a good creek with a full head. The whole flat, on to which the creek\r\nemerged from the hills, was one vast spring. This place, the best camp\r\nthey had yet met with, was named Eva Springs. Leaving the main body\r\nresting at these springs, the leader, with two companions, started ahead,\r\nand was successful in finding some native wells that enabled him to break\r\nup his main camp and advance with all the men and material.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June they crossed the boundary-line between the two\r\ncolonies, and found themselves on the scrubby, sandy tableland common to\r\nthe interior. At some native wells, which were called Waterloo Wells,\r\nthey made an enforced sojourn of about a month; in addition they lost\r\nthree camels, and one of the Afghans nearly died of scurvy. When they\r\nwere at last enabled to leave the Waterloo Wells, they found themselves\r\nplunged into the salt lake country, where the native inhabitants exist on\r\nshallow wells and soakage springs. By their reckoning they were now\r\nwithin ten miles of Gregory's Sturt's Creek; but though Warburton made\r\ntwo separate attempts to find the place, he was unable to recognise any\r\ncountry that at all resembled the description given by Gregory.\r\nRightfully ascribing this disappointment to an error in his longitude, he\r\nproceeded on a westerly course once more. The tale of each day's journey\r\nnow becomes a dreary record of travels across a monotonous barren\r\ncountry, and an incessant search for native wells, their only means of\r\nsustaining life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to other causes for delay, the excessive heat caused by\r\nradiation from the surrounding sandhills during the day compelled the\r\nleader to spare his camels as much as possible by travelling at night.\r\nThis naturally led to a most unsatisfactory inspection of the country\r\ntraversed, and it was impossible to say what clues to water were passed\r\nby unwittingly.\r\n\r\nStarvation now commenced to press close upon them; the constant delays\r\nhad so reduced their store of provisions that they were almost at the end\r\nof their resources, whilst still surrounded by the endless desert of\r\nsand-ridges and spinifex. Sickness, too, befel them, so that almost the\r\nfull brunt of the work of the expedition was placed upon the capable\r\nshoulders of Lewis and the black boy Charley. The time of these two was\r\ntaken up in watching the smoke of the fires of the natives, or in looking\r\nfor their tracks. During the early morning and in the evening they could\r\ntravel a little, but at night the myriad swarms of ants prevented the\r\ntired men from obtaining their natural sleep. If they stopped to rest the\r\ncamels, they only prolonged their own starvation; yet without rest the\r\ncamels could not carry them ahead in the search for water. On the 9th of\r\nOctober, the camels strayed away during the night, but luckily came\r\nacross a small waterhole, and at this welcome spot the party rested for a\r\nwhile; indeed with the exception of Lewis and the native, they were all\r\ntoo weak to do aught else. They slaughtered a camel, and were fortunate\r\nto shoot a few pigeons and galah parrots, the fresh meat restoring a\r\nlittle of their strength. They had long since despaired of carrying out\r\nthe original purpose of the expedition. All that they could hope for was\r\nto struggle on with the last remaining flicker of life to the nearest\r\nsettled country. This was the Oakover River, on the north coast, and to\r\nthe head of the Oakover, therefore, their worn-out camels were directed.\r\nThey could entertain no hope of relief before reaching the Oakover, for\r\nthe discoverer of that river, Frank Gregory, a man always reluctant to\r\nacknowledge defeat, had been turned from the southward attempt by this\r\nvery desert across which they were painfully toiling. On the evening that\r\nthey started for the station, the whole party were about to ride blindly\r\non into waterless country, where, but for the black boy, they would all\r\nhave perished. The boy had left the camp early in the morning, and,\r\nhaving come across the fresh tracks of some natives, followed them up to\r\ntheir camp, where he found a well. He hastened back to the party to tell\r\nthem of his discovery, only to find that they had gone. Fortunately he\r\nhad sharp ears, and hearing the distant receding tinkle of the camel\r\nbell, by dint of energetically pushing on and cooeeing loudly, he managed\r\nto attract their attention, and then led them back to the new source of\r\nrelief. Lewis and the black boy were now the eyes and ears of the party,\r\nand but for them the expedition would never have reached the river.\r\n\r\nA fresh start was made after a welcome halt at this well. Warburton and\r\nhis son could scarcely sit their camels, and followed the weary caravan\r\nalmost with apathy. On the 14th of November Charley found another native\r\nwell; but its discovery nearly cost him his life. When close to the\r\nnative camp, he had gone ahead by himself, as he usually did, so as not\r\nto startle the aboriginals. The blacks received him kindly and gave him\r\nwater, but when he cooeed for his companion, they took sudden alarm and\r\nattacked him. They had speared him in the arm and back, and cut his head\r\nopen with a club when Lewis came up just in time to rescue him. Evidently\r\nthis attack was not premeditated, but caused by the sudden fear aroused\r\nby the sight of the white men and camels. At this well Lewis and one of\r\nthe Afghans went ahead to strike the head of the Oakover, for they\r\nthought they must be drawing near the coast, as the nights were growing\r\ncool and dewy, and they had found traces of white iron work in an old\r\ncamp. In a week Lewis returned, having reached a tributary of the river;\r\nand on the 5th of December the whole party arrived at the rocky creek\r\nthat he had found.\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded slowly down the Oakover, but came across no sign of\r\noccupation. The indefatigable Lewis had therefore again to go ahead for\r\nhelp whilst the others waited for him, living on the flesh of the last\r\ncamel. He had 170 miles to journey over before he reached the cattle\r\nstation belonging to Grant, Harper, and Anderson, where he was\r\nimmediately supplied with horses and provisions to take back to the\r\nstarving men.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 29th of December as Warburton was lying in the shade\r\nthinking moodily that the station must have been abandoned, and that\r\nLewis had surely been compelled to push on to Roebourne, when the black\r\nboy from a tree-top gave a cheerful signal. Starting to their feet, the\r\nastonished men found the pack-horses and the relief party almost in their\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nOf the seventeen camels with which they had started, the two that Lewis\r\nhad taken on to the station were the only survivors; and all their\r\nequipment had been abandoned piecemeal in the desert.\r\n\r\n15.4. WILLIAM CHRISTIE GOSSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. William Christie Gosse, Deputy Surveyor-General of South\r\nAustralia.]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of April, about a week after the departure of Warburton,\r\nWilliam Christie Gosse, Deputy Surveyor-General of South Australia, also\r\nleft Alice Springs on an exploring expedition, having been appointed by\r\nthe South Australian Government to take charge of the Central and Western\r\nExploring Expedition. Like Warburton, he was frustrated by dry country in\r\nhis endeavour to reach Perth. He had with him both white men and Afghan\r\ncamel drivers, and a mixed outfit of horses and camels. He left the\r\ntelegraph line and struck westward, soon finding himself in very dry\r\ncountry, where he lost one horse on a dry stage. He made a depot camp on\r\na creek which he called the Warburton, and while on an excursion from\r\nthis camp he had the singular experience of riding all day through heavy\r\nrain and camping at night without water, the sandy soil having quickly\r\nabsorbed the downpour. On his return he found that the creek at the camp\r\nwas running, and though repeated attempts had been made by the Afghans to\r\ngoad one of the camels over, the animal obstinately refused to cross.\r\nProbably the leader thought that it was fortunate for the progress of the\r\nexpedition that they were not likely to meet with many more running\r\nstreams. After passing both Warburton's tracks and those of Giles, Gosse\r\nreached the extreme western point of the Macdonnell Ranges, where another\r\nstationary camp was pitched. The leader made a long excursion to the\r\nsouth-west, and at 84 miles, after passing over sand-ridges and spinifex\r\ncountry, caught sight of a remarkable hill, that on a nearer approach\r\nproved to be of singular limestone formation.\r\n\r\n\"When I got clear of the sandhills, and was only two miles distant, and\r\nthe hill, for the first time coming fairly in view, what was my\r\nastonishment to find it was one immense rock rising abruptly from the\r\nplain; the holes I had noticed were caused by the water in some places\r\ncausing immense caves.\"\r\n\r\nThis hill, which Gosse made an ineffectual attempt to ascend, he called\r\nAyer's Rock. He returned to his depot camp, crossing an arm of Lake\r\nAmadeus as he did so, and moved the main body on to Ayer's Rock. Rain\r\nhaving set in heavily for some days, he pushed some distance into Western\r\nAustralia, but soon reached the limit of the rainfall. After many\r\nattempts to penetrate the sand-hill region which confronted him, the heat\r\nand aridity compelled him to turn back.\r\n\r\nHis homeward course was by way of the Musgrave Ranges, where he found a\r\ngreater extent of pastoral country than had been thought to exist there.\r\nHe discovered and christened the Marryat, and followed down the Alberga\r\nto within sixty miles of the Overland Line, when he turned north-eastward\r\nto the Charlotte Waters station.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gosse's exploration did not add any important new features, he\r\nfilled in many details in the central map, and was able correctly to lay\r\ndown the position of some of the discoveries of Ernest Giles.\r\n\r\nWilliam Christie Gosse was the son of Dr. Gosse, and was born in 1842 at\r\nHoddesdon in Hertfordshire. He had come to Australia with his father in\r\n1850, and in 1859 had entered the Government service of South Australia.\r\nHe held various positions in the survey department, and, after his return\r\nfrom the exploring expedition, he was made Deputy Surveyor-General. He\r\ndied prematurely on August 12th, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. TRAVERSING THE CENTRE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Ernest Giles.\r\n\r\nIllustration. Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16.1. ERNEST GILES.\r\n\r\nErnest Giles was born at Bristol, a famous birthplace of adventurous\r\nspirits. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, London, and after leaving\r\nschool came out to South Australia to join his parents, who had preceded\r\nhim thither. In 1852 he went to the Victorian goldfields, and\r\nsubsequently became a clerk, first in the Post Office, Melbourne, and\r\nafterwards in the county court.\r\n\r\nHaving resigned his clerkship, he pursued a bush life, and in 1872 made\r\nhis first effort in the field of exploration. His party was a small one,\r\nthe funds being found by contributions from S. Carmichael, one of the\r\nparty, Baron von Mueller, Giles himself, and one of his relatives. The\r\nmembers of the expedition were Giles, Carmichael, and Robinson; 15 horses\r\nand a little dog were included in the equipment. They started from\r\nChambers Pillar, and it was on this journey that Lake Amadeus and Mount\r\nOlga were discovered, the two most enduring physical features whose\r\ndiscovery we owe to Giles. The lake is a long narrow salt-pan of\r\nconsiderable size, but without any important affluents; Mount Olga is a\r\nsingular mountain situated about 50 miles from the lake. On this trip\r\nGiles went over much untrodden country, but the smallness of the party at\r\nlast convinced him that it was beyond their frugal means to force their\r\nway through the desert country to the settlements of West Australia.\r\nGiles was fortunate on this his first trip in having two able and willing\r\nbushmen for his companions; otherwise he would not have progressed as far\r\nas he did and returned in safety. But most untiring endeavours will not\r\ncompensate for the lack of numbers, and Giles was forced to return beaten\r\nfrom his first attempt.\r\n\r\nHis second expedition took place about the same time as that undertaken\r\nby Gosse. In consequence of a stirring appeal by Baron von Mueller, he\r\nhad now the advantage of both substantial private help and a small sum\r\nfrom the South Australian Government. The party numbered four: W.H.\r\nTietkins, who afterwards made an honourable name as an independent\r\nexplorer; the unfortunate Alfred Gibson; and a lad named Andrews, in\r\naddition to the leader.\r\n\r\nGiles left the settled district at the Alberga, and made several\r\ndetermined efforts to push through the sandy spinifex desert that had\r\nbaffled so many. It was during one of these forlorn hopes that Gibson\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAnxious to reach a range which he had sighted in the distance, and where\r\nhe hoped to find a change of country, Giles made up his mind to make a\r\ndetermined effort to reach it, carrying a supply of water with him on\r\npack-horses. As usual, Tietkins was to accompany him, but as Gibson\r\ncomplained of having been always previously left in camp, he was allowed\r\nto go instead. The two kept doggedly on, the horses, as they gave in,\r\nbeing left to find their way back to the main camp. At last, when several\r\ndays out, they had but two horses left. Giles sent Gibson back on one,\r\nwith instructions to push on for the camp, taking what little water he\r\nwanted out of a keg they had buried on their outward way, leaving the\r\nremainder for his use. He himself intended to make a final effort to\r\nreach the range.\r\n\r\nGiles's horse soon gave in after they parted, and he had to start to\r\nreturn on foot. On his weary way back he saw that one of the abandoned\r\nhorses had turned off from the trail, and that Gibson's tracks turned off\r\ntoo, seemingly following it. When he reached the keg, he found that the\r\ncontents were untouched. Fearing greatly that the unfortunate man's fate\r\nwas sealed, Giles dragged himself on to the camp. A search was at once\r\ninstituted, but it was fruitless. Neither man nor horse was ever seen\r\nagain; and the scene of his fate is known as Gibson's Desert.\r\n\r\nDuring his excursions in various directions, Giles discovered and\r\ntraversed four different ranges of hills. The party were much worried by\r\nthe hostility of the blacks, and, what with the uneasiness caused by\r\ntheir attacks, the plague of myriads of ants, the loss of Gibson, and the\r\nfailure of their own hopes, they were forced to return to Adelaide,\r\nbaffled for a time, but not beaten.\r\n\r\nWe thus see how the arid belt of the middle country had defied three\r\ndifferent explorers -- Warburton, Gosse, and Giles -- one equipped with\r\ncamels only, one with camels and horses, and one who had relied on horses\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. A Camel Caravan in an Australian Desert.]\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Giles took the field once more. This time, owing to the\r\ngenerosity of Sir Thomas Elder, of South Australia, he was well-prepared.\r\nHe had a fine caravan of camels, and had his former companion Tietkins\r\nwith him, besides a completely-equipped party.\r\n\r\nThe start was made from Beltana, the next halting-place being Youldeh,\r\nwhere a depot was formed. From this place they shifted north to a native\r\nwell, Oaldabinna. As the water supply here proved but scanty, Giles\r\nstarted off to the westward to search for a better place, sending\r\nTietkins to the north on a similar errand accompanied by Young.\r\n\r\nGiles pushed his way for 150 miles through scrub and past shallow\r\nlakelets of salt water until he came to a native well or dam, containing\r\na small supply of water. Beyond this he went another 30 miles, but\r\nfinding himself amongst saline swamps and scrub, he then returned to the\r\ndepot. Tietkins and his companion were not so successful. At their\r\nfurthest point they had come across a large number of natives, who, after\r\ndecamping in a terrified manner, returned fully armed and painted for\r\nwar. No attempts of the two white men to open friendly communication or\r\nto obtain any information from them had succeeded.\r\n\r\nA slight shower of rain having replenished the well they were camped at,\r\nGiles determined to make a bold push to the west, trusting to the powers\r\nof endurance of his camels to carry him on to water.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the dam that he had formerly visited, he was agreeably\r\nsurprised to find that it had been nearly filled by the late rains. As it\r\nnow contained plenty of water for their wants, and there was good feed\r\nall around, they rested by it until the supply of water began to show\r\nsigns of declining.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of September, 1875, he left the Boundary Dam, as he called\r\nit, and commenced to try conclusions with the desert to the westward. For\r\nthe first six days of their march the caravan passed through scrubs of\r\noak, mulga, and sandalwood; next they entered upon vast plains\r\nwell-grassed, with salt-bush and other edible shrubs growing upon them.\r\nCrossing these, the camel train again passed through scrub, but not so\r\ndense as before.\r\n\r\nWhen 250 miles had been accomplished, Giles distributed amongst the\r\ncamels the water he had carried with him. As they kept on, sand-ridges\r\nbegan to make their appearance, native smoke was often seen, and they\r\nfrequently crossed the tracks of the natives.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day from the Boundary Dam, Tietkins, who judged by the\r\nappearance of the sandhills that there was water in the neighbourhood,\r\nsent the black boy Tommy on to a ridge lying south of their course. It\r\nwas fortunate that he did so, for hidden in a hollow surrounded by\r\nsandhills was a tiny lake which they were passing by unheeded until Tommy\r\narrested their progress with frantic shouts. Giles gave this place of\r\nsuccour, which he should have named after his companion, the commonplace\r\nname of Victoria Spring; and here the caravan rested for nine days.\r\n\r\nRecruited and in good spirits, they soon found themselves amongst the\r\ndistinctive features of the inner slopes of Western Australia -- outcrops\r\nof granite mounds and boulders, salt lakes, and bogs. Their next camp of\r\nrelief was at a native well 200 miles from Victoria Spring.\r\n\r\nThe quietude of their life at this encampment was however rudely broken\r\nby the natives. During their stay they had had friendly intercourse with\r\nthe blacks, but no suspicions of treachery had been aroused. The\r\nexplorers were just concluding their evening meal when Young saw a mob of\r\narmed and painted natives approaching. He caught sight of them in time to\r\ngive the alarm to the others, who stood to their arms. Giles says in his\r\njournal that they were \"a perfectly armed and drilled force,\" though\r\nmilitary discipline was a singular characteristic to find amongst the\r\nblacks of this barren region. A discharge of firearms from the whites\r\nchecked their assailants before any spears had been thrown, and probably\r\nprevented the massacre of the whole party.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this camp the caravan travelled through dense scrub, with\r\noccasional hills and patches of open country intervening. They were\r\nfortunate to find some wells on the way, and on the 4th of November\r\narrived at an outside sheep-station in the settled districts of Western\r\nAustralia, and Giles's long-cherished ambition was at last fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe result of this trip was satisfactory to Giles, who thus saw his many\r\nfruitless, though gallant efforts, at last crowned with success; but the\r\njourney had no substantial geographical or economic results. It resembled\r\nWarburton's in having been a hasty flight with camels through an unknown\r\ncountry, marking only a thin line on the map of Australia. An explorer\r\nwith the means at his command, in the shape of camels, of venturing on\r\nlong dry stages with impunity, is tempted to sacrifice extended\r\nexploration of the country bordering his route and the deeper and more\r\nvaluable knowledge that it brings to rapidity of onward movement. John\r\nForrest, for example, was able, owing to the many minor excursions he was\r\nforced to make because of the nature of his equipment, to gain infinitely\r\nmore knowledge of the geographical details of the country he passed over\r\nthan either Warburton or Giles.\r\n\r\nGiles now retraced his steps to South Australia, following a line to the\r\nnorthward of Forrest's track. He went by way of the Murchison, and\r\ncrossed over the Gascoyne to the Ashburton, which he followed up to its\r\nhead. Then striking to the south of east, he cut his former track of 1873\r\nat the Alfred and Marie Range, the range he had so ardently striven to\r\nreach when the unfortunate man Gibson died. How futile was the vain\r\nattempt that led to Gibson's death he now realised. He finally arrived at\r\nthe Peake telegraph station. Few watercourses were crossed; the country\r\nwas suffering under extreme drought; and no discoveries of importance\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\nGiles published a narrative of his explorations entitled Australia Twice\r\nTraversed. He was a gold medallist of the Royal Geographical Society. He\r\nentered the West Australian Government service on the Coolgardie\r\ngoldfields, and, on the 13th of November, 1897, died at Coolgardie, West\r\nAustralia, where the Western Australian Government erected a monument to\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\n16.2. W.H. TIETKINS AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. W.H. Tietkins, 1878.]\r\n\r\nW.H. Tietkins was born in London on the 30th of August, 1844, and was\r\neducated at Christ's Hospital. He arrived in Adelaide in September, 1859,\r\nand took to bush life and subsequently survey-work. On the conclusion of\r\nhis exploring expeditions with Ernest Giles, he engaged in the survey of\r\nYorke's Peninsula for the South Australian Government, and then paid a\r\nvisit to England. On his return he went to Sydney, and did some survey\r\nwork for the New South Wales Government into whose service he permanently\r\nentered. He is now a Lands Inspector on the South Coast.\r\n\r\nAfter his experiences as second with Ernest Giles, Tietkins took charge,\r\nin 1889, of the Central Australian Exploring Expedition. He left Alice\r\nSprings on the overland line on the 14th of March to examine the hitherto\r\nunknown country to the north and west of Lake Amadeus. Late in the month\r\nof May he discovered and named the Kintore Range, to the north-west of\r\nLake Macdonald, and ascended one of the elevations, Mount Leisler. During\r\nthe beginning of the next month he practically completed the circuit of\r\nLake Macdonald and discovered the Bonython Ranges to the south-east. On\r\nhis return journey, Tietkins corrected the somewhat exaggerated notion\r\nentertained as to the extent of Lake Amadeus, as he passed through sixty\r\nmiles of country supposed to be contained in its area without seeing a\r\nvestige of this natural feature. In after years he surveyed and correctly\r\nfixed its location.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, surveyor Lewis, the gallant and tireless spirit whose\r\nindefatigable efforts had pulled the Warburton Expedition out of the fire\r\ntook charge of an expedition equipped by Sir Thomas Elder to define the\r\nmany affluents of Lake Eyre. Starting from the overland line, Lewis\r\nskirted Lake Eyre to the north, penetrated to Eyre's Creek, traced that\r\nstream and the Diamantina into Lake Eyre, and confirmed the opinion that\r\nthe waters of Cooper's Creek as well as the more westerly streams found\r\ntheir way into that inland sea. J.W. Lewis afterwards died in Broome,\r\nWestern Australia.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Queensland Government decided to send out an expedition to\r\nascertain the amount of pastoral country that existed to the westward of\r\nthe Diamantina River. It was placed in charge of W.O. Hodgkinson, who had\r\noccupied a subordinate position in the Burke and Wills expedition. They\r\nstarted from the upper reaches of the Cloncurry and, crossing the main\r\ndividing range on to the Diamantina, followed that river down to the\r\nsouthern boundary of Queensland, where it had been named the Everard by\r\nLewis. This portion was now well-known, and the tracks of the pioneers'\r\nstock were everywhere visible. From the lower Diamantina, the party went\r\nwestwards, and, beyond Eyre's Creek, in good pastoral country, came upon\r\na watercourse which was named the Mulligan. This creek Hodgkinson\r\nfollowed up to the north; and, not knowing that he had crossed its head\r\nwatershed, went on down the Herbert (Georgina) under the impression that\r\nhe was still on the Mulligan. He was undeceived when he overtook N.\r\nBuchanan with cattle, who was then engaged in re-stocking the stations on\r\nthe Herbert that had been abandoned in the commercial depression of 1872\r\nand 1873. This was the last exploring expedition sent out by the\r\nQueensland authorities, the country within the bounds of that colony\r\nbeing by that time all known.\r\n\r\nBut across the western border, the vacant and unknown country of South\r\nAustralia attracted many private expeditions to examine it in search of\r\npastoral holdings. Amongst those from Queensland were two brothers named\r\nProut, who, with one man, went out to look for new grazing lands, and\r\nnever returned. Many months afterwards a search party, under W.J.H.\r\nCarr-Boyd, found some of the horses, and then the remains of one of the\r\nbrothers. It was evident from the fragments of a diary recovered, that\r\nthey had pushed far into the dry region of South Australia, and had met\r\ntheir deaths from thirst on the return journey. Probably some of the\r\nwaters on which they had relied had unexpectedly failed.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, Nathaniel Buchanan, a veteran pioneer and overlander of\r\nQueensland, made an excursion from the Queensland border to Tennant's\r\nCreek on the overland telegraph line. Starting from the Ranken, a\r\ntributary of the Georgina, Buchanan struck a westerly course, and\r\ndiscovering the head of a well-watered creek running through fine open\r\ndowns, he followed it down to the westward for some days. The creek\r\neventually ran out into dry flats, so Buchanan struck westward to the\r\ntelegraph line, which he reached after some hardship, a little to the\r\nsouth of Tennant's Creek. The creek which he discovered, and to which\r\nFavenc afterwards gave the name of Buchanan's Creek, was a most important\r\ndiscovery, affording a practicable stock route to the great pastoral\r\ndistrict lying between the Queensland border and the overland line.\r\n\r\nFrank Scarr, a Queensland surveyor, was the next to invade this strip of\r\nstill unknown land. He attempted to steer a course south of Buchanan's,\r\nbut was turned back by the dry belt of country. On this excursion he also\r\nfound two of the horses of the ill-fated Prout brothers. Scarr then made\r\nfurther north, and, with the assistance of the creek discovered by\r\nBuchanan, was enabled to reach the line. Owing to the severity of the\r\ndrought, however, he was unable to extend his researches any further, and\r\nreturned safely to Queensland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Ernest Favenc.]\r\n\r\nIn 1878, a project for a railway line on the land-grant principle between\r\nBrisbane and Port Darwin was originated in the former city. The\r\nproprietor of the leading Brisbane newspaper, Gresley Lukin, organized\r\nand equipped a party to explore a suitable line of country, the object\r\nbeing to ascertain the nature and value of the land in the neighbourhood\r\nof the proposed line, and the geographical features of the unexplored\r\nportion. The leader was Ernest Favenc, who was accompanied by surveyor\r\nBriggs, G. Hedley, and a black boy. They left Cork station on the\r\nDiamantina, and kept a north-west course through the untraversed country\r\nbetween that river and the Georgina, or Herbert, as it was then called.\r\nThey then crossed the border into South Australia, and struck the creek\r\nwhich Buchanan had found, and to which the name of Buchanan's Creek was\r\nnow given. Leaving this creek at the lowest water, the party struck\r\nnorth, and, after finding two large but shallow lakes, came, in the midst\r\nof most excellent pastoral country, to a fine lagoon which they named the\r\nCorella Lagoon. The trees on the banks of this lagoon, which was about\r\nfour miles long, were at the time of the visit white with myriads of\r\ncorella parrots; hence the name. Some three hundred natives were\r\nassembled at this lagoon to celebrate their tribal rites; but they showed\r\na friendly disposition.\r\n\r\nFrom the Corella Lagoon the expedition proceeded north and discovered a\r\nlarge creek running from east to west. It proved to be one of the\r\nprincipal creeks of that region, and was named Cresswell Creek; and a\r\npermanent lagoon on it was named the Anthony Lagoon. Cresswell Creek was\r\nfollowed down until, like its fellow creek the Buchanan, it too was\r\nabsorbed in dry, parched flats. The last permanent water on Cresswell\r\nCreek was named the Adder Waterholes, on account of the large number of\r\ndeath-adders that were killed there. A dry stage of ninety miles now\r\nintervened between the party and the telegraph line, and the first\r\nattempt to cross, on a day of terrible heat, resulted in a return to the\r\nAdder Camp, three horses having succumbed to the heat, thirst, and the\r\ncracked and fissured arid plains. It being the height of the summer\r\nseason, and no water within a reasonable distance, it was evidently\r\nuseless to sacrifice any more horses. There was nothing to do, therefore,\r\nbut to await at the last camp the fall of a kindly thundershower, by\r\nmeans of which they might bridge the dry gap between them and the line.\r\n\r\nThe long delay exhausted the supply of rations, but by means of birds --\r\nducks and pigeons -- horseflesh, and the usual edible bush plants --\r\nblue-bush and pigweed -- the party fared sufficiently well.\r\n\r\nDuring their detention at this camp, many short excursions were made, and\r\nthe country traversed was found to be mostly richly grassed downs. Where\r\nflooded country was encroached upon, the dry beds of former lakes were\r\nfound, encircled in all cases with a ring of dead trees.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1879, the thunderstorms set in, and the party reached\r\nPowell's Creek telegraph station in safety.\r\n\r\nThis expedition opened up a good deal of fine pastoral country, which is\r\nnow all stocked and settled.\r\n\r\nWestern Australia was still busy in the field of exploration. In 1876\r\nAdam Johns and Phillip Saunders started from Roebourne and crossed to the\r\noverland line in South Australia. Ostensibly theirs was a prospecting\r\nexpedition; but as the country to the eastward of the Fitzroy River was\r\nthen unknown, it was an important exploration event. They were\r\nunsuccessful in finding gold, but on their arrival at the line they\r\nreported having passed through good pastoral country.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the east and west tracks of the Queensland\r\nexplorers, and of Alexander Forrest,* did more to throw open that part of\r\nAustralia to settlement than did the north and south journey of Stuart,\r\nmore important as that one was from the purely geographical point of\r\nview. Stuart led the way across the centre of the continent, but even\r\nafter the telegraph line was constructed on his route, very little was\r\nknown of the country to the east and the west.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 19.\r\n\r\nThe South Australian Government had several times made slight attempts to\r\nreach the Queensland border, but in 1878, they sent out H.V. Barclay to\r\nmake a trigonometrical survey of most of the untraversed country between\r\nthe line and the Queensland boundary. Barclay left Alice Springs, of\r\nwhich station he first fixed the exact geographical position by a series\r\nof telegraphic exchanges with the observatory in Adelaide. Barclay had\r\nmuch dry country to contend against, but managed to reach a north point\r\nclose to Scarr's furthest south. He did not, however, on that occasion,\r\nactually arrive at the Queensland border, but explored the territory on\r\nthe South Australian side. During the conduct of the survey he discovered\r\nand named the Jervois Ranges, the spurs of the eastern MacDonnell, and\r\nthe following tributaries of Lake Eyre -- the Hale, the Plenty, the\r\nMarshall, and the Arthur Rivers.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Favenc, on a private expedition to report on pastoral country,\r\ntraced the heads of several of the rivers of the Carpentarian Gulf, and\r\nin the following year left the north Newcastle Waters to examine and\r\ntrace the Macarthur River. The river was followed from its source to the\r\nsea, and a large extent of valuable pastoral country and several\r\npermanent springs found in its valley; a large tributary, the Kilgour,\r\nwas also discovered and named. These short excursions, and some\r\nexploratory trips made by MacPhee, east of Daly Waters, may be said to\r\nhave concluded exploration between the line and the Queensland border.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, the South Australian Government despatched an expedition in\r\ncharge of David Lindsay to complete the survey of Arnhem's Land. Lindsay\r\nleft the Katherine station, and proceeded to Blue Mud Bay. On the way the\r\nparty had a narrow escape of massacre at the hands of the blacks, who\r\nspeared four horses, and made an attempt to surprise the camp of the\r\nwhites. Lindsay had trouble with his horses in the stony, broken\r\ntableland that had nearly baffled Leichhardt; and from one misfortune and\r\nanother, lost a great number of them. In fact, at one time, so rough was\r\nthe country that he anticipated having to abandon his horses and make his\r\nway into the telegraph station on foot. On the whole, however, the\r\ncountry was favourably reported on, particularly with regard to tropical\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nAnother journey was undertaken about this time by O'Donnell and\r\nCarr-Boyd, who left the Katherine River and pushed across the border into\r\nWestern Australia. They succeeded in finding a large amount of pastoral\r\ncountry; but no important geographical discoveries were made.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 H. Stockdale, who had had considerable experience in the southern\r\ncolonies, and was an old bushman, made an excursion from Cambridge Gulf\r\nto the south through the Kimberley district. Stockdale found well-grassed\r\ncountry with numerous permanently-watered creeks. When he came to the\r\ncreek which he named Buchanan Creek, he formed a depot. On his return\r\nfrom an expedition to the south with three men, he found that during his\r\nabsence the men left in charge of it had been hunting kangaroos with the\r\nhorses instead of allowing them to rest. There were other irregularities\r\nas well, and Stockdale found his resources too much reduced, both in\r\nhorseflesh and rations, to continue the exploration. They started for the\r\ntelegraph line, but on the way the two men who had been misbehaving\r\nrequested to be left behind. As they persisted in their wish, there was\r\nnothing left but to accede to it. The two men, with as much rations as\r\ncould be spared, arms, and powder and shot, were then left at their own\r\nrequest on a permanent creek in a country where game could be obtained.\r\nStockdale himself had to undergo some hardship before reaching the\r\nOverland Line. Although search was made for the two men, they were never\r\nafterwards found.\r\n\r\nOne little area of country, of no great importance but still untrodden by\r\nman yet remained in Central Australia, as a lure to excite the white\r\nman's curiosity. This unvisited spot was situated north of latitude 26,\r\nand bounded on the west by the Finke River, on the north by the Plenty\r\nand Marshall Rivers and part of the MacDonnell Ranges, and on the west by\r\nthe Hay River and the Queensland border. An expedition to exploit it was\r\nequipped by Ronald MacPherson, and assisted by the South Australian\r\nGovernment with the loan of camels. The leader was Captain V. Barclay, an\r\nold South Australian surveyor, whose name has already been mentioned in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\nBarclay had been born in Lancashire, at Bury, on the 6th of January,\r\n1845. He had entered the Royal Navy in 1860, and had been severely\r\nwounded on board H.M.S. Illustrious by a gun breaking loose when at\r\ntarget practice. He had emigrated to Tasmania in the seventies, and in\r\n1877 had been appointed by the South Australian Government to explore the\r\ncountry lying between the line and the Queensland border, a notice of\r\nwhich occurs in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nThe party, lightly equipped to be more effective, was absent from\r\nOodnadatta from July 24th until December 5th 1904, and in that time\r\naccomplished much useful work in the face of great difficulties. On\r\naccount of the great heat, the expedition had to resort to travelling by\r\nnight and resting by day. The country was principally high sandy ridges,\r\nsome so steep that it was not easy to find crossing-places. They had to\r\nsacrifice a lot of valuable stores, personal effects, and a valuable\r\ncollection of native curios, all chiefly on account of the shortness of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBy this date the whole of the central portion of Australia was known, and\r\nthe greater part of it mapped; while all the permanently-watered country\r\nhad been rapidly utilised by the pastoralists.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 3. THE WEST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. John Septimus Roe, First Surveyor-General of West\r\nAustralia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17. ROE, GREY, AND GREGORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n17.1. ROE AND THE PIONEERS.\r\n\r\nWhilst Sturt and kindred bold spirits had been painfully but surely\r\npiecing together the geographical puzzle of the south-east corner of the\r\nAustralian continent, a similar struggle between man and Nature had\r\ncommenced in the south-west. Here, Nature kept close her secrets with no\r\nless pertinacity than in the east; but, though the struggle was just as\r\narduous, the environment was very different. Instead of rearing an\r\nunscalable barrier of gloomy mountains, Nature here showed a level front\r\nof sullen hostility. Nor did she lure the first explorers inland with a\r\nsmiling face of welcome once the outworks had been forced, as she had\r\ndrawn Evans when he reached the head-waters of the Macquarie and Lachlan.\r\nBeyond the sources of the western coastal streams, she fought silently\r\nfor every eastward mile of vantage ground, spreading before the\r\nadventurous intruder the salt lake and the arid desert.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1791, George Vancouver, a whilom middy of Cook's,\r\ndiscovered and named King George's Sound, when in command of H.M.S.\r\nDiscovery. He formally took possession of the adjacent country, and\r\nremained there some days, making a careful survey of both the inner and\r\nouter harbours.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December, 1826, Sir Ralph Darling, then Governor of New\r\nSouth Wales, sent Major Lockyer, of the 57th, with a detachment of the\r\n39th, a regiment intimately associated with the early settlement of\r\nAustralia, to form a settlement at King George's Sound, where they landed\r\non the 25th of December of the same year. This settlement was established\r\nin order to forestall the French, who, according to rumour, intended to\r\noccupy the harbour and adjacent lands.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, 1827, Captain James Stirling, of H.M.S. Success,\r\nleft Sydney, intending to survey those portions of the west coast\r\nunvisited by Lieutenant King, and also to investigate the nature of the\r\ncountry in the neighbourhood of the Swan River with a view to its\r\nsuitability for settlement. Stirling was accompanied by Charles Fraser,\r\nwho had considerable experience as adviser upon Australian sites for\r\nsettlement. Both Stirling and Fraser reported favourably on the Swan\r\nRiver; and the latter waxing enthusiastic on its eligibility, it was\r\ndecided to found a new colony there.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, Captain Fremantle of H.M.S. Challenger hoisted the British flag\r\nat the mouth of the Swan River, and thenceforth the whole of the\r\nAustralian continent was under British sway. Captain, now\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Stirling arrived a month later in the transport\r\nParmelia, and the free colony of Western Australia was launched on its\r\nvaried career.\r\n\r\nThe names first mentioned in the annals of land exploration in Western\r\nAustralia are those of Alexander Collie and Lieutenant William Preston,\r\nwho together explored the country on the coast between Cockburn Sound and\r\nGeographe Bay. This was in November, 1829, and in the following month Dr.\r\nJ.B. Wilson, who came to the Sound with Captain Barker on the abandonment\r\nof Raffles Bay, made an excursion from the Sound and discovered and named\r\nthe Denmark River.\r\n\r\nIn a passage in a letter written by R.M. Davis, of the medical staff, to\r\nCharles Fraser, the botanist, there is a detailed reference to this\r\ntrip:--\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Wilson, who came here with Captain Barker, started in a direction to\r\nSwan Port (Swan River) with a party of men, and in eleven days went over\r\nat least two hundred miles of ground. He says, without fear of\r\ncontradiction in future, that there is far greater proportion of good\r\nland in this direction than in any other part of Australia that he had\r\nbeen in, and also wood of large growth, with innumerable rivers. He\r\nascended a very high mountain, which he called Mount Lindsay, in honour\r\nof the 39th regiment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of March, 1830, we first hear of the exploring feats of\r\nLieutenant Roe, R.N., the Surveyor-General of the new colony. Captain\r\nJohn Septimus Roe was born in 1797, and entered the navy. He accompanied\r\nCaptain P. King to explore the north and north-west coasts of Australia,\r\nin 1818, and was a member of King's expedition in 1821. He was the first\r\nSurveyor-General of Western Australia, and held that position for\r\nforty-two years. He is commonly styled the father of western exploration.\r\nHe died at Perth on May 28th, 1878. Mrs. Roe, who accompanied her husband\r\nto Western Australia in 1829, pre-deceased him in 1870.\r\n\r\nOn the date mentioned in 1830, Roe was in the field exploring in the\r\nvicinity of Cape Naturaliste. Afterwards he was active in the country\r\nbetween the head-waters of the Kalgan and Hay Rivers. In 1836 he first\r\ntried serious conclusions with the inland country of Western Australia,\r\nwhen he headed an expedition to explore the tableland that lies to the\r\nnorth and east of Perth. The country was dreary and depressing, and,\r\njudging from its configuration and natural properties, he was unable to\r\nrecommend it as a site for settlement or to depict it as the entrance to\r\nmore pleasant lands beyond. He reached Lake Brown, near the western\r\nboundary of the present Yilgarn goldfield; but the only noteworthy\r\nfeatures that he perceived were the salt lakes that are now so well-known\r\nthroughout Western Australia. In 1839, Roe distinguished himself by\r\nrescuing Grey's dismembered party. On the 14th of September, 1848, he\r\nstarted to make an attempt at further discovery to the eastward. He had\r\nwith him six men, twelve horses, and three months' provisions. Upon\r\nleaving the outer settlements, they encountered the same depressing\r\ncountry as before. Having crossed it, they were turned from their course\r\nby scrub of exceeding density, which in turn was succeeded by sandy\r\ndesert plains. Foiled for the time being they made for the south coast,\r\nwhere they recruited their strength at one of the outlying settlements.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th they started again, and followed up the course of the\r\nPallinup River. They ascended a branch coming from the north-east, and\r\nfor a time revelled in the spectacle of well-grassed and promising\r\nvalleys; but they soon again came amongst the scrub and sand plains of\r\nthe inland desert. Sighting a granite range to the eastward, they made\r\ntowards it, but the outlook from its summit brought nothing but exceeding\r\ndisappointment. Fortunately the weather was showery, and the lack of\r\nwater did not induce such keen anxiety as the total absence of grass.\r\nStill pushing to the eastward, they found their difficulties increase at\r\nevery step. To the perils of travel through dense thickets and over\r\nbarren, scorching plains, there was now added the risk of death from\r\nthirst. It was not until after days of extreme privation that they\r\nreached some elevated peaks, where they obtained a little grass and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTheir course lay now to the south-east, towards the range sighted by\r\nEyre, and named the Russell Range, and there commenced a desperate\r\nstruggle with the intervening desert.\r\n\r\nSo weak were the horses and so compact the belts of scrub, that in three\r\ndays they had traversed only fifty miles. After being four days and three\r\nnights without water for the horses, they reached a rugged hill which\r\nthey named Mount Riley, where they were relieved by a scant supply.\r\nThence it was but fifty miles to the Russell Range, but the journey\r\ninvolved a repetition of the worst sufferings they had endured. The scrub\r\ndisputed their passage the whole route, being often so dense as to defy\r\nthe use of the axe, and many long detours had to be made before they\r\nreached their goal.\r\n\r\nEvery hope they had entertained of a change for the better was shattered\r\nby an inspection of the country to which they had so laboriously\r\npenetrated. The range, destined to be associated with so many subsequent\r\nimportant explorations, was a mass of naked rocks, and from the summit\r\nthey could see nothing but the interminable scrub thickets, and in the\r\ndistance the thin blue line of ocean. Fortunately they found a little\r\ngrass and water, which saved the lives of their animals. They had\r\ndiscovered a coal seam at the mouth of the Murchison River, and now, on\r\ntheir return journey, they found another at the Fitzgerald River. This\r\nwas Roe's longest and most important expedition, and it placed him in the\r\nfront rank of Australian explorers.\r\n\r\nAmongst the very early explorers who did as good work as the scanty\r\nopportunities permitted, was Ensign R. Dale, of the 63rd Regiment, who\r\npushed east of the Darling Range. Bannister, Moore, and Bunbury are other\r\nnoteworthy names amongst those of the early discoverers.\r\n\r\n17.2. SIR GEORGE GREY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Sir George Grey.]\r\n\r\nIn 1837 an expedition in charge of Captain George Grey and Lieutenant\r\nLushington was sent out from England to the Cape of Good Hope. It was\r\nunder instructions from Lord Glenelg, and was to procure a small vessel\r\nat the Cape to convey the party and their stores to the most convenient\r\npoint in the vicinity of the Prince Regent's River on the coast. Once\r\nlanded there, the party was to take such a course as would lead them in\r\nthe direction of the great opening behind Dampier's Land, where they were\r\nto make every endeavour to cross to the Swan River.\r\n\r\nThe schooner Lynher was chartered at the Cape, and on the 3rd of\r\nDecember, 1837, the party was landed at Hanover Bay, with large\r\nquantities of livestock, stores, seeds, and plants. Whilst the schooner\r\nproceeded to Timor for ponies, Grey employed the time in forming a\r\ngarden, building sheds for the stores, and in exploring the country in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Hanover Bay. On the 9th of December, he hoisted the\r\nBritish flag and went through the ceremony of taking possession. On the\r\n17th of January the Lynher returned, and nearly a month later Grey and\r\nhis party, which now numbered twelve, started from the coast with\r\ntwenty-six half-broken Timor ponies as baggage-carriers, and some sheep\r\nand goats.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season had now set in, and many of the stock succumbed almost\r\nat the outset, whilst their route proved a veritable tangle of steep\r\nspurs and deep ravines. On the 11th of February they came into collision\r\nwith the natives, and Grey was severely wounded in the hip with a spear.\r\nWhen he had recovered sufficiently to be lifted on to one of the ponies,\r\na fresh start was made, and on the 2nd of March his perseverance was\r\nrewarded by the discovery of a river which he named the Glenelg. He\r\nfollowed the course of this river upwards, and reported the country as\r\ngood, being well-grassed and watered. Sometimes his route lay along the\r\nriver's bank; at other times by keeping to the foot of a sandstone ridge\r\nhe was enabled to avoid detours around many wearisome bends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Rock Painting, North-Western Australia.]\r\n\r\nThe party continued along the Glenelg for many days, until indeed they\r\nwere checked by a large tributary coming from the north. As both the\r\nriver and the tributary were here much swollen, they had to fall back on\r\nthe range. It was among the recesses of this range that Grey discovered\r\nsome curious cave paintings of the blacks, in which the aboriginal\r\nfigures were represented as clothed.\r\n\r\n[*Footnote.] A subsequent photograph of these paintings, by Brockman, is\r\nreproduced in Chapter 20.\r\n\r\nUnable to find a pass through the mountains, and enfeebled by his wound,\r\nGrey determined to retrace his steps. As a last resort he sent Lushington\r\nsome distance ahead, but there was no noticeable change to report in the\r\naspect of the country. Hanover Bay was reached on the 15th of April. The\r\nLynher was waiting there at anchor, and H.M.S. Beagle was lying in Port\r\nGeorge the Fourth, awaiting the return of Captain Stokes, who was away\r\nexploring the coast. The party having embarked, the Lynher sailed for the\r\nIsle of France, where they safely arrived. Thus ended Captain Grey's\r\nfirst expedition, which is interesting chiefly as a proof of the heroic\r\nqualities of its members; for the Glenelg River has never invited\r\nsettlement, and has yet to prove that it possesses any considerable\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\nDuring January, 1839, Grey explored the country between the Williams and\r\nthe Leschenhault, while searching for a settler who had been lost in the\r\nbush.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of February in the same year, Grey, who had been back\r\nendeavouring to persuade Sir James Stirling to assist him in his\r\nexplorations, was enabled to start on another exploring enterprise. The\r\nobject of this, his second important expedition, was to examine the\r\nundiscovered parts of Shark's Bay, and to make excursions as far inland\r\nas circumstances permitted. The party comprised four of the members of\r\nhis first expedition, five other men, and a Western Australian\r\naboriginal, and they left Fremantle in an American whaler, taking three\r\nwhale-boats with them. They were duly landed at Bernier Island, where\r\ntheir troubles commenced at once. The whaler sailed away, taking with her\r\nby mistake the whole of their supply of tobacco. There was no water on\r\nthe island, and, in their first attempt to start, one of the boats was\r\nsmashed and nearly half a ton of stores lost. The next day they succeeded\r\nin making Dorre Island, but that night both the remaining boats were\r\ndriven ashore by a violent storm. Two or three days were spent in making\r\ngood the damage, when they succeeded in making the mainland, and obtained\r\na supply of fresh water. They had landed at or near the mouth of a stream\r\nwhich afterwards proved to be the second longest river in Western\r\nAustralia. Grey named it the Gascoyne, and found that it was then dry\r\nbeyond the limit of tidal influence. They then pulled up the coast, but\r\none night, when effecting a landing, both boats were swamped, and their\r\npreviously-damaged provisions suffered another soaking. This accident\r\nkept them prisoners for a week till the wind and surf had abated. Tired,\r\nhungry, and ill, they were here harassed by frequent threats and one\r\nactual attack by the blacks. A slight break in the weather tempted them\r\nforth once more, and, having succeeded in righting the boats, they made\r\nfor the mouth of the Gascoyne, where they re-filled their water-beakers.\r\nOn March 20th they made a desperate effort in the teeth of foul weather\r\nto fetch their depot on Bernier Island. We may picture their dismay when\r\nthey found that during their absence a hurricane had swept the island,\r\nand scattered their cherished stores to the four winds.\r\n\r\nTheir position was now as desperate as could be imagined: the southerly\r\nwinds had set in, and they had to coast along a surf-beaten shore against\r\na head wind. Their food was scanty, and they were weak with the constant\r\ntoils they had undergone. There was nothing for it, however, but to put\r\nto sea again, and they succeeded in reaching Gantheaume Bay on the 31st\r\nof March. Fate had not yet spent all her wrath on them, and in attempting\r\na landing, Grey's boat was dashed to destruction upon a rock, and the\r\nother received such a buffeting as to place it beyond repair. The only\r\nhope of safety lay in an overland march to Perth, three hundred miles\r\naway, upon their twenty pounds of damaged flour and one pound of salt\r\npork per man; and yet, so wearied were they with the unceasing battle\r\nagainst wind and sea, that they even welcomed this hazardous prospect as\r\na change for the better.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far before differences of opinion arose. Grey\r\nnaturally wished the men to cover the ground as quickly as possible\r\nwhilst their strength lasted, whilst they favoured slow marches, relieved\r\nby frequent rests. Grey, who recognised that in their weakened condition\r\nthey could not replenish their scanty food supplies from the native game,\r\nheld firmly to his opinion, and made strenuous efforts to quicken their\r\nprogress; but the comparative safety of the shore had lulled his\r\nfollowers into a feeling of false security; and after goading them along\r\nfor a hundred miles, bearing the chief burden of the march and sharing\r\nmuch of his scanty food with the black boy, Grey left them to push\r\nonwards, and if possible send them assistance. He took two or three\r\npicked men with him, and after terrible sufferings and privations,\r\nreached Perth, whence a rescue party was immediately despatched. This\r\nparty found only one man, Charles Wood, who by more closely following\r\nGrey's instructions, had made better progress than the others. The\r\nremaining five could not be found, and at the end of a fortnight the\r\nrescuers were forced to return on account of the lack of provisions. Roe\r\nimmediately left with another party, and, after experiencing trouble in\r\ntracking the erratic wanderings of the unfortunates, came upon most of\r\nthem hopelessly regarding a face of rock that stopped their march along\r\nthe beach, unable to muster sufficient strength to climb it. They had\r\nthen been three days without water, having nothing in their canteens but\r\na loathsome substitute.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Smith, a lad of eighteen who had accompanied the expedition\r\nas a volunteer, had died two days before the rescue; his body was\r\nrecovered and buried in the wilderness. Walker, the surgeon and second in\r\ncharge, was still absent; but he had voluntarily left the main body and\r\nhad pushed on for assistance towards Fremantle, which he safely reached.\r\n\r\nDuring these unfortunate expeditions, Grey had shown a generous spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice combined with high courage and a fine enthusiasm for\r\ngeographical discovery. But his lack of experience and his ignorance of\r\nthe local seasonal conditions counterbalanced these, and explained his\r\nfailures. Afterwards he became Acting Government Resident at Albany, on\r\nKing George's Sound, and he was at a critical period Governor of South\r\nAustralia. But Australia proper saw little of him in his after prime, and\r\nhis fame was built up elsewhere, in New Zealand and at the Cape of Good\r\nHope.\r\n\r\nGrey's reports left doubt as to the precise value of the country he\r\ntraversed under such trying circumstances, but he is justly credited with\r\nthe discovery of many rivers on the west coast -- the Grey, the Buller,\r\nthe Chapman, the Greenough, the Arrowsmith, the Hutt, the Bowyer, and\r\nthose important streams, the Murchison and the Gascoyne.\r\n\r\n17.3. AUGUSTUS C. GREGORY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Augustus C. Gregory, 1880. Photo, Freeman, Sydney.]\r\n\r\nIn 1846 we come upon a name destined to become linked with the history of\r\nexploration in most parts of Australia. There were three notable brothers\r\nof the name of Gregory; but as their expeditions, at least those of\r\nAugustus and Frank, were conducted independently, with the exception of\r\nthe first, we shall deal with them separately. H.C. Gregory, it is true,\r\nassociated his work mostly with that of his brother, A.C. Gregory,\r\ngenerally in a subordinate position, but Frank Gregory won nearly equal\r\nfame with his brother Augustus as an independent explorer.\r\n\r\nA.C. Gregory was the son of Lieutenant J. Gregory of the 78th\r\nHighlanders. He was born at Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, in 1819, and\r\ncame to Western Australia with his parents in 1829 in the Lotus, 500\r\ntons, Captain Summerson, the second passenger ship that sailed for\r\nWestern Australia. Lieutenant Gregory had five sons in all: William,\r\nAugustus, Francis, Henry, and James. The Lotus reached Fremantle about\r\nthe 10th of October, 1829. Captain Gregory had been obliged to retire\r\nfrom active service, being incapacitated by serious wounds received at El\r\nHamed, in Egypt, and held a large grant of land from the Imperial\r\nGovernment in lieu of pension. On this grant, situated not far from\r\nPerth, he established a farm, and on that farm Augustus and his brothers\r\nreceived the balance of their education and underwent their course of\r\nbush training. Augustus, after his last expedition, was appointed in 1859\r\nSurveyor-General of Queensland, in which colony he settled down later,\r\nafter retiring from active official life. He had a seat in the\r\nLegislative Council, and was a prominent freemason. He was created C.M.G.\r\nin 1874, and K.C.M.G. in 1903, and had several honours conferred upon him\r\nby the Royal Geographical Society. He died in Brisbane, in 1905.\r\n\r\nIf we except a short excursion down the Blackwood and Kojonup Rivers, his\r\nexpedition of 1846, in which he was accompanied both by F.T. and H.C.\r\nGregory, was the first important enterprise undertaken by him. It was in\r\nAugust that his party left Captain Scully's station at Bolgart's Springs,\r\nabout seventy miles from Perth.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the settled districts they at once found themselves in the\r\nbarren country that was damming back the eastward flow of settlement.\r\nHaving traversed it, they reached a range of granite hills, and turning\r\nmore to the northward, they kept along these for the sake of the\r\nrain-water to be found in the rock holes. On striking again to the east,\r\nthey encountered an extensive salt lake, and in attempting to cross an\r\narm of this marsh, their horses were bogged, and extricated only after\r\ngreat labour. The lake was afterwards proved to be of great size, and to\r\nhem them in completely to the eastward, whilst, owing to its\r\ncrescent-like formation, for five days it baffled all their attempts to\r\nproceed northwards.\r\n\r\nFinally abandoning the lake, which they called Lake Moore, they turned to\r\nthe westward to examine some of the streams crossed by Grey during his\r\nreturn from Shark's Bay. On the head of one of these rivers, the Irwin,\r\nthey found a seam of coal.\r\n\r\n\"Having pitched our tent and tethered our horses, we commenced to collect\r\nspecimens of the various strata, and succeeded in cutting out five or six\r\nhundredweight of coal with the tomahawk, and in a short time had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the first fire of West Australian coal burning\r\ncheerfully in front of the camp, this being the first discovery of coal\r\nin Western Australia.\"\r\n\r\nThe party then returned by way of the Moore River to Bolgart Springs,\r\nwhich they reached on the 22nd of September.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of coal deposits and of country available for settlement\r\nwas seen to be of great importance by the Government, and Lieutenant\r\nHelpman, A.C. Gregory, his brother Henry, and Messrs. Irby and Meekleham,\r\nin the colonial schooner Champion, were despatched to procure a quantity\r\nof coal for testing. They were also instructed to make a further\r\ninspection of the pastoral capabilities of the district, of which there\r\nhad been so many conflicting opinions. A three days' examination of the\r\ncountry convinced them that it was suitable for settlement.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Gregory took charge of an expedition to the north of Perth,\r\norganised by the settlers of the colony, and entitled The Settlers'\r\nExpedition; its object being to proceed to the Gascoyne River, examining\r\nthe intervening country as to its suitability for pastoral purposes.\r\n\r\nGregory was accompanied by one of his brothers, Messrs. Burges, Walcott,\r\nand Bedart, and private King of the 96th Regiment, of whose services he\r\nspeaks very highly. This expedition excited great hopes amongst the\r\nsettlers, who found most of the horses and provisions. The party left\r\nLefroy's station of Welbing on the 9th of September, with ten pack, and\r\ntwo riding-horses, but did not succeed in penetrating any distance beyond\r\nthe Murchison, being turned back at all points, after repeated efforts,\r\nby the belt of impervious scrub between the Murchison and Gascoyne. They\r\ntherefore returned without seeing the latter river, after having attained\r\na distance of 350 miles from Perth; but they succeeded in finding a\r\nconsiderable extent of available country, both pastoral and agricultural,\r\nand in discovering a vein of galena on the Murchison. They re-entered\r\nPerth on the 17th of November.\r\n\r\nThe following month, Gregory, Bland, and three soldiers of the 96th\r\naccompanied Governor Fitzgerald by sea to Champion Bay to examine the new\r\nmineral discoveries. The galena lode was found to be more important than\r\nhad been at first supposed. On their return to the schooner, an affray\r\noccurred with the natives, in which the Governor was wounded.\r\n\r\n\"As the country was covered with dense wattle thickets, the natives took\r\nadvantage of the ground, and having completely surrounded the party,\r\ncommenced first to threaten to throw their spears, then to throw stones,\r\nand finally one man caught hold of Mr. Bland by the arm, threatening to\r\nstrike him with a dowak; another native threw a spear at myself, though\r\nwithout effect; but before I could fire at him, the Governor, perceiving\r\nthat unless some severe example was made, the whole party would be cut\r\noff, fired at one of the most forward of our assailants and killed him;\r\ntwo other shots were fired by the soldiers, but the thickness of the\r\nbushes prevented our seeing with what effect. A shower of spears, stones,\r\nkylies and dowaks followed, and although we moved to a more open spot,\r\nthe natives were only kept off by firing at any that exposed themselves.\r\nAt this moment a spear struck the Governor in the leg, just above the\r\nknee, with such force as to cause it to protrude two feet on the other\r\nside, which was so far fortunate as to enable me to break off the barb\r\nand withdraw the shaft. The Governor, notwithstanding his wound,\r\ncontinued to direct the party, and although the natives made many\r\nattempts to approach close enough to reach us with their spears, we were\r\nable by keeping on the most open ground and checking them by an\r\noccasional shot, to avoid their attacks when crossing the gullies.\"\r\n\r\nThe natives followed them for seven miles, but finally desisted, and the\r\nwhites reached the beach and boarded the Champion without further mishap.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Gregory made his most celebrated journey in the north of central\r\nAustralia. An account of this journey might have been included in Part 2,\r\nbut as the name of Gregory is so intimately connected with Western\r\nAustralia, this section is perhaps the most appropriate place in which to\r\nrecount its incidents. [But its lengthy place in which to recount its\r\nincidents (sic)]. But its numerous details demand another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18. A.C. AND F.T. GREGORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n18.1. A.C. GREGORY ON STURT'S CREEK AND THE BARCOO.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government having long considered the feasibility of further\r\nexploration of the interior of Australia voted 5000 pounds for the\r\npurpose, and offered the command of the expedition to A.C. Gregory. As\r\nthe inexplicable disappearance of Leichhardt was then exciting much\r\ninterest in Australia, search for the lost expedition was to form one of\r\nits chief duties.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August, 1855, Gregory's party left Moreton Bay in the\r\nbarque Monarch, attended by the schooner Tom Tough. There were eighteen\r\nmen in all. H.C. Gregory was second in command, Ferdinand von Mueller was\r\nbotanist, J.S. Wilson geologist, J.R. Elsey surgeon and naturalist, and\r\nJ. Baines artist and storekeeper. They had on board fifty horses, two\r\nhundred sheep, and provisions and stores calculated to last them eighteen\r\nmonths on full rations.\r\n\r\nThey did not reach Point Pearce, at the mouth of the Victoria River,\r\nuntil the 24th of September. There they separated, the schooner taking\r\nthe stores up the river, and the Monarch proceeding on her voyage to\r\nSingapore. The horses had been landed at Point Pearce, whence Gregory,\r\nhis brother, and seven men took them on overland by easy stages. One\r\nnight the horses were attacked by crocodiles, and three of them were\r\nseverely wounded. They followed up the course of the Fitzmaurice River\r\nand then passed over rough country, not reaching the Victoria until the\r\n17th. On the 20th they rejoined the members who had gone round by the\r\nschooner, and learned that she was aground in the river. A large part of\r\ntheir stores was spoiled; and the number of the sheep had also been\r\nreduced to forty, in consequence of their being foolishly kept penned up\r\non board. These losses and accidents considerably weakened Gregory's\r\nresources, and it was not until the 24th of November that any excursion\r\non horseback was undertaken. An attempt had previously been made to\r\nascend the river in the portable boat with which the expedition had been\r\nsupplied, but it was not successful, as the boat could not navigate the\r\nrocky bars in safety.\r\n\r\nGregory left camp accompanied by his brother, Dr. von Mueller, and\r\nWilson, taking seven horses and twenty days' rations, his object being to\r\nexamine the country through which the exploring party would have to\r\ntravel on their route to the interior. On this preliminary trip, he\r\npenetrated as far as latitude 16 1/2 south, whence, finding the\r\ntributaries flowing from fine open plains and level forest country, all\r\nwell-grassed, he returned to the main camp.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, 1856, Gregory started with a much larger party on\r\nan energetic dash into the interior. He had with him six men besides his\r\nbrother, Dr. von Mueller and Baines the artist, and thirty-six horses. He\r\nretraced his steps along his preliminary route, and on the 30th of\r\nJanuary, thinking it wise judging from the rapid evaporation of the\r\nwaterholes, to make his means of retreat secure, he formed a temporary\r\ncamp, leaving there four men and all the horses but eleven to await his\r\nreturn, whilst he, his brother, Dr. Mueller, and a man named Dean, rode\r\nahead to challenge the desert to the south. On the 9th of February,\r\nhaving run the Victoria out, he crossed an almost level watershed, and\r\nfound himself on the confines of the desert. From a slight rise he looked\r\nsouthwards:--\r\n\r\n\"The horizon was unbroken; all appeared one slightly undulating plain,\r\nwith just sufficient triodia and bushes growing on it to hide the red\r\nsand when viewed at a distance.\"\r\n\r\nGregory reviewed the problem from a logical standpoint. He decided to\r\nfollow the northern limit of the desert to the westward, until he should\r\nfind a southern-flowing watercourse which would afford him the\r\nopportunity to make a dash beyond its confines.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of February he came to a small flat which gradually developed\r\ninto a channel and ultimately became a creek, running first west, and\r\nthen south-west. This gave him his desired opening, and he pursued the\r\ncourse of the creek through good open country, finding the water\r\nplentiful, though shallow. On February 20th, however, the channel of the\r\ncreek was lost in an immense grassy plain. The country to the south being\r\nsandy and unpromising, Gregory kept westwards, and succeeded in again\r\npicking up the channel, now finding the water in it to be slightly\r\nbrackish. That day he crossed the boundary of Western Australia. The\r\ncreek now gave promise of continuity, the water-holes taking on a more\r\npermanent appearance. It was now pursuing a general south-west course,\r\nand Gregory, though still rightly anticipating that it would eventually\r\nbe lost in the dry interior, determined to follow it as far south as\r\nshould be compatible with safety. He named the creek Sturt's Creek, after\r\nthe gallant explorer of that name, who was naturally then often in his\r\nmind. The creek maintained its southern course, until, on the 8th of\r\nMarch, it ran out into a mud plain and a salt lake.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, after having followed Sturt's Creek for nearly 300 miles, we have\r\nbeen disappointed in our hope that it would lead to some important outlet\r\nto the waters of the Australian interior; it has, however, enabled us to\r\npenetrate far into the level tract of country which may be termed the\r\nGreat Australian Desert.\"\r\n\r\nGregory, convinced that no useful results could arise from any attempt to\r\npenetrate the inhospitable region to the south, determined to return\r\nbefore the rapidly-evaporating water on which they were dependent should\r\nvanish and cut off all retreat. He therefore retraced his steps up\r\nSturt's Creek, and on the 28th of March arrived at his temporary depot,\r\nwhere he found the men all well and the horses much improved in\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of April, A.C. Gregory, taking his brother Henry, Baines, and\r\none man, started on an excursion to examine the eastern tributaries of\r\nthe Victoria, and was absent a little over a fortnight. On their return,\r\nthe whole of the members started for the landing-place on the Victoria,\r\nwhich they reached on the 9th of May. After all arrangements and\r\npreparations had been completed, Gregory, with most of the party, started\r\non the return journey overland to Moreton Bay. The Tom Tough, now caulked\r\nand repaired, was to make her way to the Albert River in the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria, where they would again probably meet.\r\n\r\nTraversing the tributaries of the Victoria on his homeward way, Gregory\r\nmet with no remarkable incident until his arrival on the Elsey, a\r\ntributary of the Roper River, which he named after the surgeon of the\r\nexpedition. It was here that he came upon the last authentic trace of\r\nLeichhardt. He describes his discovery as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"There was also the remains of a hut and the ashes of a large fire,\r\nindicating that there had been a party camped there for several weeks;\r\nseveral trees from six to eight inches in diameter had been cut down with\r\niron axes in fair condition, and the hut built by cutting notches in\r\nstanding trees and resting a large pole therein for a ridge; this hut had\r\nbeen burnt apparently by the subsequent bush fires, and only some pieces\r\nof the thickest timber remained unconsumed. Search was made for marked\r\ntrees, but none found, nor were there any fragments of leather, iron, or\r\nother equipment of an exploring party, or of any bones of animals other\r\nthan those common to Australia. Had an exploring party been destroyed\r\nhere, there would most likely have been some indications, and it may\r\ntherefore be inferred that the party proceeded on its journey. It could\r\nnot have been a camp of Leichhardt's in 1845, as it is 100 miles south of\r\nhis route to Port Essington; and it was only six or seven years old,\r\njudging by the growth of the trees; having subsequently seen some of\r\nLeichhardt's camps on the Burdekin, Mackenzie and Barcoo Rivers, a great\r\nsimilarity was observed in regard to the manner of building the hut and\r\nits relative position with regard to the fire and water supply, and the\r\nposition in regard to the great features of the country was exactly where\r\na party going westward would first receive a check from the waterless\r\ntableland between the Roper and Victoria Rivers, and would probably camp\r\nand reconnoitre ahead before attempting to cross to the north-west\r\ncoast.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Roper the party travelled around the shore of the Gulf, keeping\r\nrather more inland than Leichhardt had done. On reaching the Albert they\r\nfound that the Tom Tough had not yet arrived at the rendezvous; and\r\nGregory, leaving a marked tree with a message indicating the situation of\r\nsome instructions he had buried, pushed onwards.\r\n\r\nHis route from the Albert lay along much the same line of country as that\r\nfollowed by Leichhardt during his journey to Port Essington. He did not,\r\nhowever, make such a wide sweep to the north, up to the Mitchell, but\r\nstruck away from Carpentaria at the Gilbert River. He corrected the error\r\nLeichhardt had fallen into over the situation of the Albert, and re-named\r\nthe river that he had mistaken the Leichhardt. The exploring party\r\nreached the settled districts at Hay's station, Rannes, south of the\r\nFitzroy; and thence reached Brisbane on the 16th of December, 1856.\r\n\r\nTo advance the search after Leichhardt, the interest in whose fate had\r\nbeen stimulated by the discovery made by Gregory, a public meeting was\r\nheld in September, 1857, at which resolutions were passed requesting\r\nmonetary assistance from the Government, and offering the leadership of a\r\nnew expedition to A.C. Gregory. The appeal was successful, and\r\naccordingly in March, 1858, Gregory left Euroomba station on the Dawson\r\nwith a party of nine in all, one of his brothers going as second. The\r\nexpedition was equipped for light travelling, taking as means of carriage\r\npack-horses only, of which there were thirty-one, as well as nine\r\nsaddle-horses.\r\n\r\nGregory crossed the Nive on to the Barcoo, which he proceeded to run\r\ndown, finding the country in a very different condition from that in\r\nwhich it bloomed when Mitchell rode rejoicingly along what he thought was\r\na Gulf river. A sharp look out was of course kept for any trace of the\r\nmissing party, and on the 21st of April they came across another marked\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n\"We discovered a Moreton Bay ash (Eucalyptus sp.), about two feet in\r\ndiameter marked with the letter L on the east side, cut through the bark\r\nabout four feet from the ground, and near it the stumps of some small\r\ntrees that had been cut with a sharp axe, also a deep notch cut in the\r\nside of a sloping tree, apparently to support the ridge-pole of a tent,\r\nor some similar purpose; all indicating that a camp had been established\r\nhere by Leichhardt's party...No other indications having been found, we\r\ncontinued the search down the river, examining every likely spot for\r\nmarked trees, but without success.\"\r\n\r\nApproaching the Thomson River, they found the country suffering from\r\ndrought although the river was running in consequence of some late rains.\r\nAs winter was now approaching, there was however no spring in the\r\nvegetation, and their horses were suffering great hardship. On the 15th\r\nof May they found themselves beyond the rainfall, and realised that lack\r\nof water was likely to be added to an absence of grass.\r\n\r\n\"We, however, succeeded in reaching latitude 23 degrees 47 minutes, when\r\nthe absence of water and grass -- the rain not having extended so far\r\nnorth, and the channels of the river separating into small gullies and\r\nspreading on to the wide plains -- precluded our progressing further to\r\nthe north or west; and the only chance of saving our horses was to return\r\nsouth as quickly as possible. This was a most severe disappointment, as\r\nwe had just reached that part of the country through which Leichhardt\r\nmost probably travelled if the season was sufficiently wet to render it\r\npracticable. Thus compelled to abandon the principal object of the\r\nexpedition, only two courses remained open -- either to return to the\r\nhead of the Victoria (Barcoo) River and attempt a northern course by the\r\nvalley of the Belyando, or to follow down the river and ascertain whether\r\nit flowed into Cooper's Creek or the Darling.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter alternative was chosen, and they proceeded to retrace their\r\nsteps down the Thomson, and on reaching the junction of the Barcoo they\r\ncontinued south and west. In fact, following Kennedy's route, they soon\r\nfound themselves involved in the same difficulties that had beset that\r\nexplorer. The river -- now Cooper's Creek -- broke up into countless\r\nchannels running through barren, fissured plains. Toiling on through\r\nthese, varied by an interlude of sandhills, Gregory at last reached a\r\nbetter-grassed land, where his famished horses regained a little\r\nstrength. He reached Sturt's furthest point, and continued on to the\r\npoint where Strzelecki's Creek carried off some of the surplus flood\r\nwaters, and finally lost the many channels amongst the sandhills and\r\nflooded plains. He again struck Strzelecki's Creek and traced it as he\r\nthen thought, into Lake Torrens, but in reality into Lake Blanche, for\r\nthe salt lake region had not then been properly delimited. He reached\r\nBaker's recently-formed station, eight miles beyond Mount Hopeless, and\r\nthence he went on to Adelaide.\r\n\r\n18.2. FRANK T. GREGORY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Frank T. Gregory.]\r\n\r\nIt was in Western Australia, in March, 1857, that Frank T. Gregory\r\ncommenced his career as an independent explorer by taking advantage of a\r\nsudden heavy downpour of rain on the upper reaches of the Murchison\r\nRiver, which flooded the dry course of the lower portion where he was\r\nthen engaged on survey work. Gregory at once seized the opportunity thus\r\nafforded of examining the upper reaches of this river, from which former\r\nexplorers had been driven back by the aridity of the country. Accompanied\r\nby his assistant, S. Trigg, he proceeded up the river finding, thanks to\r\nthe wet season that had preceded him, luxuriant grass and ample supplies\r\nof water. In consequence, he had a more pleasing account of the country\r\nto bring back than the report based on the thirsty experiences of Austin.\r\nSo easy did he find the country, that only scarcity of provisions\r\nprevented him from pushing on to the long-sought-for Gascoyne River. As\r\nit was, he returned after an absence of thirteen days, having completed\r\nwhat the Perth Gazette of that time justly described as \"one of the most\r\nunassuming expeditions, yet important in its results.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so far satisfactory, and roused such fresh hopes in the minds of\r\nthe settlers, that they once more formed bright hopes of what the River\r\nGascoyne might have in store for the successful explorer. For a long time\r\nnow they had become resigned to the conclusion that their northern\r\npathway was barred by a dry, scrubby country; but they at once took\r\nadvantage of the promising practical passage along which Frank Gregory\r\nhad led the way. Another expedition was organised to penetrate to the\r\nGascoyne, and the leadership being naturally offered to Frank Gregory,\r\nwas accepted by him.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April, 1858, he left the Geraldine mine with a\r\nlightly-equipped party of six, including J.B. Roe, son of the\r\nSurveyor-General. They had with them six pack and six riding-horses, and\r\nrations for 60 days.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded up the Murchison, and on the 25th of the same month they\r\nreached a tributary called the Impey, which had been the highest point\r\nreached by Gregory the preceding year. This time, however, the party did\r\nnot find such ample pasture as he had described. Still following the\r\nriver up until the 30th April, on that day they struck off on a\r\nnor-north-east course, the course of the Murchison tending too much in an\r\neasterly direction to lead them speedily on to the Gascoyne. On the 3rd\r\nthey reached a gentle stony ascent, which proved to be the watershed\r\nbetween the two rivers. Descending the slope to the northward, they soon\r\ncame to the head of a watercourse flowing northwards. They followed the\r\nnew creek, and on the 6th of May came to a river joining it from the\r\neastward, which at last proved to be the Gascoyne.\r\n\r\nGregory kept down the south bank of the Gascoyne, and on the 12th of May\r\npassed a large tributary coming from the north, which he named the Lyons.\r\nOn the 17th they ascended a sandy ridge about sixty feet in height, and\r\nhad a view of Shark's Bay.\r\n\r\nHe returned along the north bank of the river, and having reached the\r\nLyons, followed that river up. On the 3rd of June he ascended the highest\r\nmountain yet discovered in Western Australia, which he named Mount\r\nAugustus, after his brother. Gregory gives the elevation at 3,480 feet,\r\nbut Mount Bruce in the Hammersley Range, to the north of it, has since\r\nbeen found to be higher.* From the summit, however, he had an extensive\r\nview, and was enabled to sketch in the courses of the various rivers for\r\nover twenty miles.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] 3,800 feet.\r\n\r\nAs they had now been out 51 days, and their supply of provisions was\r\napproaching the end, the party turned back at Mount Augustus, and struck\r\nsouthwards. On the 8th the Gascoyne was re-crossed at a place where its\r\ncourse lay through flats and ana-branches. On the 10th of June they again\r\ncame to the Murchison, and followed it down to the Geraldine mine, and\r\nfinally reached Perth on the 10th of July. This expedition, so fruitful\r\nin its results to the pastoral welfare of the colony, cost the settlers\r\nonly their contributions in horses and rations, and a cash expenditure of\r\nforty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of so much fresh available country on the Gascoyne River,\r\nwith the prospect of a new base for exploration in the tropical regions\r\nbeyond, attracted the attention of English capitalists. The American\r\ncivil war had so depressed the cotton trade that those interested in\r\ncotton manufacture were seeking for fresh fields in which to establish\r\nthe growth of the plant. Frank Gregory was then in London, and advantage\r\nwas taken of his presence to urge upon the Home Government and the Royal\r\nGeographical Society the desirability of fitting out an expedition to\r\nproceed direct to the north-west coast of Australia, accompanied by a\r\nlarge body of Asiatic labourers, and all the necessary appliances for the\r\nestablishment of a colony.\r\n\r\nFortunately this rash and ill-considered scheme was greatly modified\r\nunder wise advice. Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, and\r\nother gentlemen practically acquainted with the subject, suggested that\r\nthe country should be explored before the idea of any actual settlement\r\nshould be entertained. Acting on this advice, the Imperial Government\r\ngave a grant of 2,000 pounds, to be supplemented by an equal subsidy by\r\nthe Colonial Treasury.\r\n\r\nGregory therefore obtained a suitable outfit in London for the party, and\r\nleft for Perth to complete the necessary details. The usual official\r\ndelays occurred, and the expedition did not leave Fremantle, in the\r\nbarque Dolphin, until 23rd April, 1861, nearly two months later than had\r\nbeen arranged. As the rainy season in northern Australia terminates in\r\nMarch, this delay was unfortunate.\r\n\r\nNickol Bay on the north-west coast was the destination, and was safely\r\nreached. The work of disembarkation being completed, the exploring party\r\nstarted on the 25th of May, 1861.\r\n\r\nGregory first pursued a western course, as he wished to cut any\r\nconsiderable river discharging into the sea, and coming from the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Maitland Brown.]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May they struck the river which was subsequently named the\r\nFortescue. As this river seemed likely to answer their expectations of a\r\npassage through the broken range that hemmed them in to the south, they\r\nfollowed it up. A narrow precipitous gorge forced them to leave the\r\nriver, and, after surmounting a table-land, they steered a course due\r\nsouth to a high range, which, however, they found too rough to surmount.\r\nMaking back on to a north-east course, they again struck the Fortescue,\r\nabove the narrow glen which had stopped them. They followed it up once\r\nmore through good country, occasionally hampered by its course lying\r\nbetween rugged hills; but they finally crossed the range, partly by the\r\naid of the river-bed, and partly through a gap. On the 18th June, they\r\nsucceeded in completely surmounting the range, and found that to the\r\nsouth the decline was more gradual. The range was named the Hammersley\r\nRange. Their horses had suffered considerably, and had lost some of their\r\nshoes in the rough hills. From here they kept south meaning to strike the\r\nLyons River, discovered by Frank Gregory during his last trip. On coming\r\nto a small tributary which he named the Hardey, he formed a depot camp.\r\nLeaving some of the party and the most sore-footed of the horses, he\r\npushed on with three men, Brown, Harding, and Brockman, taking three\r\npackhorses and provisions for eight days.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of June they came on a large western-flowing river, which he\r\ncalled the Ashburton, and which has since proved to be the longest river\r\nin Western Australia. Having crossed this river, and still pursuing a\r\nsoutherly course, he arrived at a sandstone tableland, and on the 23rd\r\nhad, as Gregory writes, \"at last the satisfaction of observing the bold\r\noutlines of Mount Augustus.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to the depot camp on the 29th, and though anxious to follow\r\nup the Ashburton to the east, the condition of his horses' feet and the\r\nlack of shoes prevented him. During the return journey to Nickol Bay, he\r\nascended Mount Samson, and from the summit obtained an extensive view\r\nthat embraced every prominent peak within seventy miles, including Mount\r\nBruce to the north, and Mount Augustus to the south, the distance between\r\nthese two elevations being 124 geographical miles. They crossed the\r\nHammersley Range on to the level plains of the Fortescue by means of a\r\nfar easier pass than that used on the outward journey, and arrived at the\r\nBay on the 19th of July.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of July Gregory started on a new expedition to the east. On\r\nthe 9th of August he came to a river which apparently headed from the\r\ndirection they desired to explore -- namely the south-east. Crossing\r\nanother river, which they named the Shaw, the explorers, still keeping\r\neast and south of east, found on the 27th of August, a river of some\r\nimportance running through a large extent of good pastoral and\r\nagricultural land. This river was named the De Grey, but as their present\r\nobject was to push to the south-east, they left its promising banks and\r\nproceeded into a hilly country where they soon became involved in deep\r\nravines. After surmounting a rugged tableland, they camped that night at\r\nsome springs.\r\n\r\nThe next night, the 29th of August, they came, some time after dark, on\r\nto the bank of a wide river lined with the magnificent weeping tea-trees.\r\nAs three of the horses were tired out, Gregory determined to follow this\r\nriver up for a day or two, instead of closing with a range of granite\r\nhills, capped with horizontal sandstones, which loomed threateningly in\r\ntheir path.\r\n\r\nSo for two or three days they continued on the Oakover, as he christened\r\nthe river, and followed its western branch; a tributary of that led them\r\nin amongst the ranges, which were threaded by an easy pass. On the 2nd of\r\nSeptember they got through the ranges and emerged upon open sandy plains\r\nof great extent, with nothing visible across the vast expanse but low\r\nridges of red drift-sand. Here it was Gregory's lot to experience a test\r\nalmost equal to one of the grim tramps that had tried Sturt and Eyre.\r\n\r\nHe camped at a native deserted camp, and the next day failing to find any\r\nwater ahead, had to return and form a depot. Here he left five of the\r\nparty with instructions to remain three days and then fall back upon the\r\nOakover. He himself, with Brown and Harding, and six horses, went on to\r\nfind a passage.\r\n\r\nSo far he had encountered fewer obstacles, and made more encouraging\r\ndiscoveries than had fallen to the lot of any other Western Australian\r\nexplorer; but he was now confronted with the stern presence that had\r\ndaunted the bravest and best in Australia. In front of him lay barren\r\nplains, hills of drifted sand, and the ominous red haze of the desert.\r\nLet Gregory describe the scene in his own words, as the locality has\r\nbecome historic:--\r\n\r\nThe three men started on the 6th of September, \"steering south-south-east\r\nalong the ranges, looking for some stream-bed that might lead us through\r\nthe plains, but I was disappointed to find that they were all lost in the\r\nfirst mile after leaving the hills, and as crossing the numerous ridges\r\nof sand proved very fatiguing to the horses, we determined once more to\r\nattempt to strike to the eastward between the ridges, which we did for\r\nfifteen miles, when our horses again showed signs of failing us, which\r\nleft us the only alternative of either pushing on at all hazards to a\r\ndistant range that was just visible to the eastward, where, from the\r\nnumerous native fires and general depression of the country, there was\r\nevery reason to think a large river would be found to exist, or to make\r\nfor some deep rocky gorges in the granite hills ten miles to the south,\r\nin which there was every prospect of finding water. In the former case\r\nthe travelling would be smoothest, but the distance so great that, in the\r\nevent of our failing to find water, we probably should not succeed in\r\nbringing back one of our horses; while in the latter we should have to\r\nclimb over the sand-ridges which we had already found so fatiguing; this\r\ncourse, however, involved the least amount of risk, and we accordingly\r\nstruck south four miles and halted for the night.\r\n\r\n\"7th September. The horses did not look much refreshed by the night's\r\nrest; we, however, divided three gallons of water amongst them, and\r\nstarted off early, in the hope of reaching the ranges by noon, but we had\r\nnot gone three miles when one of the pack-horses that was carrying less\r\nthan forty pounds weight began to fail, and the load was placed on my\r\nsaddle-horse; it did not, however, enable him to get on more than a\r\ncouple of miles further, when we were compelled to abandon him, leaving\r\nhim under the shade of the only tree we could find, in the hope that we\r\ncould bring back water to his relief. Finding that it would be many hours\r\nbefore the horses could be got on to the ranges, I started ahead on foot,\r\nleaving Brown and Harding to come on gently, while I was to make a signal\r\nby fires if successful in finding water. Two hours' heavy toil through\r\nthe sand, under a broiling sun, brought me to the ranges, where I\r\ncontinued to hunt up one ravine after another until 5 p.m. without\r\nsuccess. Twelve hours' almost incessant walking, on a scanty breakfast\r\nand without water, with the thermometer over a hundred degrees of\r\nFahrenheit, began to tell upon me severely; so much so that by the time I\r\nhad tracked up my companions (who had reached the hills by 1 p.m. and\r\nwere anxiously waiting for me) it was as much as I could do to carry my\r\nrifle and accoutrements. The horses were looking truly wretched, and I\r\nwas convinced that the only chance of saving them, if water was not\r\nfound, would be by abandoning our pack-saddles, provisions, and\r\neverything we could possibly spare, and try and recover them afterwards\r\nif practicable. We therefore encamped for the night on the last plot of\r\ngrass we could find, and proceeded to make arrangements for an early\r\nstart in the morning. There was still a few pints of water in the kegs,\r\nhaving been very sparing in the use of it; this enabled us to have a\r\nlittle tea and make a small quantity of damper, of which we all stood in\r\nmuch need. Camp 77.\r\n\r\n\"8th September. At 4 p.m. we were again up, having disposed of our\r\nequipments and provisions, except our riding-saddles, instruments, and\r\nfirearms, by suspending them in the branches of a low tree. We divided a\r\npint of water for our breakfast, and by the first peep of dawn were\r\ndriving our famished horses at their best speed towards the depot, which\r\nwas now thirty-two miles distant. For the first eight miles they went on\r\npretty well, but the moment the sun began to have power they flagged\r\ngreatly, and it was not long before we were obliged to relinquish another\r\nhorse quite unable to proceed. By 9 a.m. I found that my previous day's\r\nmarch, and the small allowance of food that I had taken was beginning to\r\nhave its effects upon me, and that it was probable that I could not reach\r\nthe depot before the next morning, by which time the party left there\r\nwere to fall back to the Oakover; I therefore directed Brown, who was\r\nsomewhat fresher than myself, to push on to the camp and bring out fresh\r\nhorses and water, while Harding and myself would do our best to bring on\r\nany straggling horses that could not keep up with him. By dark we\r\nsucceeded in reaching to within nine miles of the depot, finding\r\nunmistakable signs towards evening of the condition to which the horses\r\ntaken on by Brown were reduced, by the saddles, guns, hobbles, and even\r\nbridles, scattered along the line of march, which had been taken off to\r\nenable them to get on a few miles further.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning they met Brown within a few miles of the depot coming back\r\nto them with water. All the horses but the two which had been left at the\r\nremotest point were recovered.\r\n\r\nFurther on Gregory remarks upon the painful effects produced on the\r\nhorses by excessive heat and thirst:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot omit to remark the singular effects of excessive thirst upon\r\nthe eyes of the horses; they absolutely sunk into their heads until there\r\nwas a hollow of sufficient depth to bury the thumb in, and there was an\r\nappearance as though the whole of the head had shrunk with them,\r\nproducing a very unpleasant and ghastly expression.\"\r\n\r\nGregory was now convinced that the sandy tract before him was not to be\r\ncrossed with the means at his command, so reluctantly he had to return to\r\nthe Oakover and follow that river down to its junction with the De Grey.\r\nDown the united streams, which now bore the name of the De Grey, the\r\nweary explorers travelled through good fertile land, until the coast was\r\nreached on the 25th of September. The worn-out state of their horses\r\ndelayed them greatly in getting across a piece of dry country between the\r\nYule and the Sherlock, where one animal had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October, they reached Nickol Bay, and were gladly welcomed\r\nby the crew of the Dolphin, who had profitably passed their time in\r\ncollecting several tons of pearl-shell and a few pearls. On the 23rd the\r\nhorses and equipment were shipped, and the Dolphin sailed for Fremantle.\r\n\r\nThis journey ended Frank Gregory's active life as an explorer; and it was\r\na noteworthy career which now closed. For the western colony he had\r\nthrown open to settlement the vast area of the north-western coastal\r\nterritory; and after relieving the Murchison from the stigma of\r\nbarrenness that rested on it, he had discovered and made known all the\r\nrivers to the north and east, until the Oakover was reached.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that Frank Gregory should, like nearly all explorers, have\r\nerred greatly in the deductions he drew. When forced to turn back from\r\nthe country beyond the Oakover, he much laments the fact, because, not\r\nonly had we now attained to within a very few miles of the longitude in\r\nwhich, from various geographical data, there are just grounds for\r\nbelieving that a large river may be found to exist draining central\r\nAustralia; but the character of the country appeared strongly to indicate\r\nthe vicinity of such a feature.\"\r\n\r\nOf course we now know that no such river drains the centre of Australia.\r\nOn the contrary, beyond Gregory's eastern limit there occurs a long\r\nstretch of coastline unmarked by the mouth of any river. Inland, to the\r\nsouthward, the country even in this day is known as the most hostile and\r\nrepellant desert in Australia, markedly deficient in continuous\r\nwatercourses. Providence, then, restrained his footsteps from a land\r\nwherein earth and sun seem to unite in hostility against the white\r\nintruder. It is a pity that Frank Gregory did not give his undoubted\r\npowers of description free scope in his Journal. Now and again he gives\r\nthem rein; but soon calls a halt, as though alarmed that picturesque\r\nlanguage should be found in a scientific, geographical journal. His\r\nbrother Augustus was unfortunately just as correct and precise.\r\n\r\nFrank went to reside in Queensland in 1862, and was nominated to the\r\nLegislative Council of that colony in 1874. Before going to Queensland he\r\nhad acted for some time as Surveyor-General of Western Australia. He was\r\nmarried at Ipswich, Queensland, to the daughter of Alexander Hume. He\r\nheld office for some time in the McIlwraith Ministry, as\r\nPostmaster-General. He was a gold medallist of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, and one of the best of the Australian explorers, as bushman,\r\nnavigator, surveyor, and scientist. He died at Toowoomba, in 1888, on the\r\n24th of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19. FROM WEST TO EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.1. AUSTIN.\r\n\r\nBy 1854 the gold fever was running high in Australia, and each colony was\r\neager to discover new diggings within its borders. Robert Austin,\r\nAssistant Surveyor-General of Western Australia, was instructed to take\r\ncharge of an inland exploring party to search for pastoral country, and\r\nto examine the interior for indications of gold.\r\n\r\nHe started from the head of the Swan River on a north-easterly course,\r\nand on the 16th of July reached a lake, rumours of whose existence had\r\nbeen spread by the blacks, who had called it Cowcowing. The colonists had\r\nhoped that it would prove to be a lake of fresh water in the Gascoyne\r\nvalley, but Cowcowing in reality was a salt marsh, no great distance from\r\nthe starting-point of Austin's expedition.\r\n\r\nThe lake was dry and its bed covered with salt incrustations, showing\r\nthat its waters are undoubtedly saline. Thence Austin made directly\r\nnorth, and passing through repellant country, such as always fell to the\r\nlot of the early western explorers in their initial efforts, he directed\r\nhis course to a distant range of table-topped hills. Here he found both\r\ngrass and water, and named the highest elevation Mount Kenneth, after\r\nKenneth Brown, a member of his party. Thence he kept a north-east course,\r\ntraversing stony plains intersected by the dry beds of sandy\r\nwatercourses. Here the party met with dire misfortune. The horses ate\r\nfrom a patch of poisonous box plant, and nearly all of them were\r\ndisabled. A few escaped, but the greater number never recovered from the\r\neffects of the poison, and fourteen died. Pushing on in the hope of\r\nfinding a safe place in which to recruit, Austin found himself so\r\ncrippled in his means of transit that he had to abandon all but his most\r\nnecessary stores.\r\n\r\nHe now made for Shark's Bay, whither a vessel was to be sent to render\r\nhim assistance or take the party home if required. The course to Shark's\r\nBay led them over country that did not tempt them to linger on the way.\r\nOn the 21st of September a sad accident occurred. They were then camped\r\nat a spring near a cave in the face of a cliff, in which there were some\r\ncurious native rock-paintings. While resting here, a young man named\r\nCharles Farmer accidentally shot himself in the arm, and in spite of the\r\nmost careful attention the poor fellow died of lockjaw in the most\r\nterrible agony. He was buried at the cave-spring camp, and the highest\r\nhill in the neighbourhood was christened Mount Farmer. His death and\r\nburial reminds one of Sturt's friend Poole, who rests in the east of the\r\ncontinent under the shadow of Mount Poole. Thus two lonely graves in the\r\nAustralian wilderness are guarded by mountains whose names perpetuate the\r\nmemory of their occupants. And who could desire a nobler monument than\r\nthe everlasting hills?\r\n\r\nAustin now came to the upper tributaries of the Murchison only to find\r\nthem waterless. Even the deep cut channel of the Murchison itself was\r\ndry. They crossed the river, but beyond it all their efforts to penetrate\r\nwestward were in vain. They had fought their way to within one hundred\r\nmiles of Shark's Bay, but they had then been so long without water that\r\nfurther advance meant certain death. Even during the retreat to the\r\nMurchison, the lives of the horses were saved only by the accidental\r\ndiscovery of a small native well in a most improbable situation, namely,\r\nin the middle of a bare ironstone plain. Their only course now was to\r\nfall back on the Murchison, hoping that they would find water at their\r\ncrossing. Austin pushed on ahead of the main body, and struck the river\r\ntwenty-five miles below their previous crossing, to make the tantalising\r\ndiscovery that the pools of water on which they had fixed their hopes\r\nwere hopelessly salt.\r\n\r\nA desperate and vain search was made to the southward, during a day of\r\nfierce and terrible heat; but on the next day, having made for some small\r\nhills they had sighted, they providentially found both water and grass.\r\nThe whole party rested at this spot, which was gratefully named Mount\r\nWelcome.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted by the sufferings he had undergone, Austin now made\r\nanother attempt to reach Shark's Bay. On the way to the Murchison, they\r\nhad induced an old native to come with them to point out the\r\nwatering-places of the blacks. At first he was able to show them one or\r\ntwo that in all probability they would have missed, but after they had\r\ncrossed the Murchison and proceeded some distance to the westward, the\r\nwater the native had relied on was found to have disappeared, and it was\r\nonly after the most acute sufferings from thirst and the loss of some\r\nmore horses, that they managed to struggle back to Mount Welcome.\r\n\r\nAustin's conduct during these terrible marches seems to have bordered on\r\nthe heroic. Whilst his companions fell away one by one and lay down to\r\ndie, and the one native of the wilds was cowering weeping under a bush,\r\nhe toiled on and managed to reach a little well which the blackfellow had\r\nformerly shown him. Without resting, he tramped back with water to revive\r\nhis exhausted companions.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Welcome they found the water on the point of giving out, and\r\nweak and exhausted though they were, an immediate start had to be made to\r\nthe Geraldine mine, a small settlement having been formed there to work\r\nthe galena lode discovered by Gregory. That they would ever reach the\r\nmine the explorers could not hope; they and their horses were in a state\r\nof extreme weakness, the distance to the mine was one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles, and to the highest point on the Murchison, where Gregory had found\r\nwater, their first stage was ninety miles. They began their journey at\r\nmidnight, and by means of forced marches, travelling day and night, they\r\nreached Gregory's old camp on the river. Fortunately they had found a\r\nsmall supply of water at one place on the way. From this point the worst\r\nof their perils were passed. They followed the river down, obtaining\r\nwater from springs in the banks, and on the 27th of November arrived at\r\nthe mine, where they were warmly entertained. Thence they returned to\r\nPerth, some by sea and some overland.\r\n\r\nAustin's exploration had led to no profitable result. Cowcowing had\r\nproved only a saline marsh similar to Lake Moore, the large lake which\r\nhad haunted Gregory; the upper Murchison was not of a nature to invite\r\nfurther acquaintance or settlement; and the whole of the journey had been\r\na disheartening round of daily struggles with a barren and waterless\r\ndistrict, under the fiery sun of the southern summer.\r\n\r\nAustin thought that eastward of his limit the country would improve; but\r\nsubsequent explorations have not substantiated his supposition. He had\r\nhad singularly hard fortune to contend against. After the serious loss he\r\nsustained by the poisoning of his horses, a risk that cannot be\r\neffectually warded off by the greatest care, he had been pitted against\r\nexceptionally dry country, covered with dense scrub and almost grassless,\r\nin which the men and horses must assuredly have lost their lives but for\r\nhis dauntless and heroic conduct.\r\n\r\nAustin afterwards settled in North Queensland, and followed the\r\nprofession of mining surveyor.\r\n\r\n19.2. SIR JOHN FORREST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. John Forrest in 1874.]\r\n\r\nJohn Forrest, the explorer who ultimately succeeded in crossing the\r\nhitherto impassable desert of the western centre, now made his first\r\nessay. An old rumour that the blacks had slain some white men and their\r\nhorses on a salt lake in the interior was now revived, and gained some\r\ncredence. A black who stated that he had visited the scene of the\r\nincident was interviewed, and Baron von Mueller wrote to the Western\r\nAustralian Government offering to lead a party thither and ascertain if\r\nthere was any truth in the report. The Government favourably considered\r\nthe offer, and made preparations to send out a party. Von Mueller was\r\nprevented from taking charge, and the command was given to John Forrest,\r\nthen a surveyor in the Government service. Forrest was born near Bunbury,\r\nWestern Australia, on the 22nd of August, 1847, and entered the Survey\r\nDepartment of West Australia in December 1865.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of April, 1869, Forrest left Yarraging, then the furthest\r\nstation to the eastward. When camped at a native well, visited by Austin\r\nthirteen years before, he says that he could still distinctly see the\r\ntracks of that explorer's horses. Past this spot he fell in with some\r\nnatives who told him that a large party of men and horses had died in a\r\nlocality away to the north, and that a gun belonging to the party was in\r\npossession of the natives. On closer examination this story was proved to\r\nhave its origin in the death of Austin's horses.\r\n\r\nForrest continued his journey to the east, and on the 18th came to a\r\nlarge dry salt lake, which he named Lake Barlee. An attempt to cross this\r\nlake resulted in the bogging of the horses, and it was only after\r\nstrenuous exertions that the horses and packs were once more brought on\r\nto hard ground. Lake Barlee was afterwards found to be of considerable\r\nsize, extending for more than forty miles to the eastward.\r\n\r\nThe native guide Forrest had with him now began to express doubts as to\r\nhis knowledge of the exact spot at which he saw the remains. After\r\nconsiderable search, Forrest came across a large party of the aborigines\r\nof the district. These men, however, proved to be anything but friendly;\r\nthey threw dowaks at the guide, and advised the whites to go back before\r\nthey were killed. Next morning they had speech with two of them, who said\r\nthat the bones were those of horses, some distance to the north; they\r\nsaid they would come to the camp the next day and lead the whites there,\r\nbut they did not fulfil their promise. No other profitable intercourse\r\nwith the blacks was possible. One old man howled piteously all the time\r\nthey were in his company, and another, who had two children with him,\r\ngave them to understand most emphatically that he had never heard of any\r\nhorses having been killed, though some natives had just killed and eaten\r\nhis own brother.\r\n\r\nAfter vainly searching the district for many days, Forrest determined to\r\nutilise the remainder of the time at his disposal by examining the\r\ncountry as far to the eastward as his resources would permit. It was now\r\nclear that the story of the white men's remains had originated in the\r\nskeletons of the horses that perished during Austin's trip. No matter how\r\ncircumstantial might be a narration of the blacks, they invariably\r\ncontradicted themselves the next time they were interrogated, and it was\r\nevident that no useful purpose would be served by following them on a\r\nfoolish errand from place to place. Forrest therefore penetrated some\r\ndistance east, but was not encouraged by the discovery of any useful\r\ncountry. Nevertheless, he started on a solitary expedition ahead, taking\r\nonly one black boy and provisions for seven days. He reached a point one\r\nhundred miles beyond the camp of the main body, to the eastward of Mount\r\nMargaret on the present goldfields. He ascended the highest tree he could\r\nfind, and found the outlook was dreary and desolate. The country was\r\ncertainly slightly more open than that hitherto traversed, but it was\r\ncovered with spinifex, interspersed with an occasional stunted gum-tree.\r\nRough sandstone cliffs were visible about six miles to the north-east,\r\nand more to the north appeared a narrow line of samphire flats with gum\r\ntrees and cypress growing on their edges. Of surface water there was no\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nOn his homeward route Forrest kept a more northerly and westerly course,\r\nand crossed Lake Barlee and examined the northern shore; but he found\r\nnothing to induce him to modify the unfavourable opinion pronounced on\r\nthe country by other explorers. He returned to Perth on the 6th August.\r\n\r\nForrest was next placed at the head of an expedition which was to cross\r\nto Adelaide by way of the shores of the Great Australian Bight, along the\r\nsame ill-omened route followed by Eyre, and never trodden since his\r\nremarkable journey. This time the historic cliffs were to be traversed\r\nwith but slight privation and no bloodshed. Though the information\r\nsupplied by Eyre was considered to be thoroughly trustworthy, it was\r\nrecognized that with the scanty means of observation at his command and\r\nhis famished condition, a few important facts might have escaped his\r\nnotice, and that if his route were followed by a well-equipped party, the\r\nterrors of the region might assume less gigantic proportions.\r\n\r\nForrest's company was to consist of the leader and his brother Alexander,\r\ntwo white men, and two natives, one of whom had accompanied Forrest on\r\nhis former trip. A coasting schooner, the Adur, of 30 tons, was to\r\naccompany them round the coast, calling at Esperance Bay, Israelite Bay,\r\nand Eucla, supplying them with provisions at these depots.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of March they left Perth. The first part of the journey to\r\nEsperance Bay was through comparatively settled and well-known country,\r\nso that no fresh interest attached to it. They arrived at Dempster's\r\nstation at Esperance a few days before the Adur sailed into the Bay, and\r\non the 9th of May, 1870, they started on their next stage to Israelite\r\nBay.\r\n\r\n[Map. Forest's Route 1869; Forrest's Route 1870; Forrest's Route 1874;\r\nGiles's Route 1873; Grey's Route 1836 and 1837 and 1839.]\r\n\r\nFrom Esperance Bay to Israelite Bay the journey lacked incident, and it\r\nwas not until Forrest again parted from his relief boat that he had to\r\nencounter the most serious part of his undertaking. He had now to face\r\nthe line of cliffs which frowned over the Bight, behind which he had, as\r\nhe knew, little or no chance of finding water for 150 miles. Having made\r\nwhat arrangements he could to carry water, he left the last water on the\r\n5th of April. About a week afterwards he reached the break in the cliffs,\r\nwhere water could be obtained by digging in the sandhills. Luckily they\r\nhad found many small rock-holes filled with water, which had enabled them\r\nto push steadily on. Forrest says that the cliffs, which fell\r\nperpendicularly to the sea, although grand in the extreme, were terrible\r\nto gaze from:--\r\n\r\n\"After looking very cautiously over the precipice, we all ran back, quite\r\nterrified by the dreadful view.\"\r\n\r\nWhile resting and recruiting at the sandhills, he made an excursion to\r\nthe north, and after passing through a fringe of scrub twelve miles deep,\r\nhe came upon most beautifully-grassed downs. At fifty miles from the sea\r\nthere was nothing visible as far as the eye could reach but gentle\r\nundulating plains of grass and saltbush. There being no prospects of\r\nwater, he was forced to turn back, fortunately finding a few surface\r\npools both on his outward and homeward way.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th they started from the sandhills for Eucla, the last\r\nmeeting-place appointed with the Adur. During this stage he kept to the\r\nnorth of the Hampton Range, and through a country well-grassed but\r\ndestitute of surface water. The party reached Eucla on the 2nd of July,\r\nand found the Adur duly awaiting them. Whilst at Eucla, Forrest, in\r\ncompany with his brother, made another excursion to the north; he\r\npenetrated some thirty miles inland, and found as before boundless\r\nplains, beautifully grassed, though destitute of any signs of water.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Eucla, the explorers had a distressing stage to the head of\r\nthe Great Bight, where they finally obtained water by digging in the\r\nsand. On this stage the horses suffered more than on any previous one,\r\nhaving had to travel three days without a drink. From this point they\r\nsoon reached the settled districts of South Australia in safety.\r\n\r\nAlthough this journey of Forrest's cannot strictly be called an exploring\r\nexpedition, inasmuch as he repeated the journey made under such terrible\r\nconditions by Eyre travelling in the opposite direction, yet it is of\r\nfirst-rate importance, inasmuch as, owing to the greater facilities he\r\nenjoyed, he was able to pronounce a more final verdict than Eyre was able\r\nto give. Forrest found that the gloomy thicket was a fringe confined to\r\nthe immediate coast-line. On every occasion that he penetrated it, he\r\ncame on good pastoral land beyond. He writes:--\r\n\r\n\"The country passed over between longitude 126 degrees 24 minutes and 128\r\ndegrees 30 minutes East as a grazing country far surpasses anything I\r\nhave ever seen. There is nothing in the settled portion of Western\r\nAustralia equal to it, either in extent or quality; but the absence of\r\npermanent water is a great drawback...The country is very level, with\r\nscarcely any undulation, and becomes clearer as you proceed north.\"\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Adelaide he received a hearty welcome, and a similar\r\nreception was accorded him on his return to Perth. Unfortunately this\r\nexpedition destroyed all hope of the existence of any river, the mouth of\r\nwhich might have been crossed unwittingly by Eyre.\r\n\r\nWe now come to that exploit which gained for Forrest a place in the\r\nforemost rank of Australian explorers. The western central desert had\r\nlong defied the explorers in their attempts to cross its dread confines.\r\nBut the young West Australian took his men and most of his horses through\r\nthe very heart of the terrible desert. We have seen how three expeditions\r\nhad started from the east for the purpose of making this continental\r\ntraverse, all differently composed -- one with the aid of camels only,\r\none with a composite equipment of both horses and camels, and the third\r\nwith only horses. The successful expedition to be now recorded travelled\r\nfrom west to east, and crossed the desert with horses only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Members of the Exploring Expedition, Geraldton to\r\nAdelaide, 1874.\r\nStanding, left to right: Tommy Pierre, Tommy Windich, James Kennedy,\r\nJames Sweeny.\r\nSeated, left to right: Alexander Forrest (Second in Command), John\r\nForrest (In Command).]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of April, 1874, Forrest left Yuin, then the border of\r\nsettlement on the Murchison, accompanied by his brother Alexander, two\r\nwhite men, and two natives, to endeavour to cross the unknown stretch of\r\ndesert country that separated the colonies of eastern Australia from the\r\nwestern settlements. Their route at first lay along the Murchison River,\r\nfollowing the upper course, which they found to run through well-grassed\r\ncountry, available for either sheep or cattle. From the crest of the head\r\nwatershed they had a view of their future travelling-ground to the\r\neastward. It appeared level, with low elevations, but there was a lack of\r\nconspicuous hills, which did not promise favourably for water-finding,\r\nthough good pasture might be obtainable.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days the party were dependent for water on occasional\r\nsprings and scanty clay-pans. On the 27th, when following down a creek,\r\nthey suddenly came upon a fine spring, apparently permanent, which is\r\ndescribed by Forrest in his journal as one of the best he had ever seen,\r\nboth the grass and other herbage around being of fine quality. This place\r\nhe named Windich Springs, after Tommy Windich, one of the blacks who had\r\nnow been with Forrest on three expeditions. To the north-west was a fine\r\nrange of hills, which he named the Carnarvon Range. On leaving this\r\noasis, the explorers found themselves in less attractive country;\r\nspinifex and sand became more frequent features of the landscape, and the\r\noccasional water-supply became precarious.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of June, Forrest discovered the spring which aided them so\r\ngreatly in their efforts to cross. This he called Weld Springs, and he\r\ndescribes it as unlimited in supply, clear, fresh, and extending down its\r\ngully for over twenty chains. At this relief camp they halted in order to\r\nrest the horses.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th Forrest started on a scouting expedition ahead, taking only a\r\nblack boy with him. He fully anticipated finding water, for as yet they\r\nhad not reached a waterless region, and he left instructions for the rest\r\nto follow in his tracks in a day's time. He was unfortunate in his\r\nselection of a course, for it led them for more than twenty miles over\r\nundulating sand-ridges, without a sight of any indication of the presence\r\nof water. At daybreak, from the top of a low stony rise, he obtained an\r\nextensive outlook. Far as he could see to the north and east, nothing was\r\nvisible but the level unending spinifex; not a watercourse or a hill in\r\nsight. Evidently they were trespassing on the edge of the central desert.\r\n\r\nTurning back they met the remainder of the party about twenty miles from\r\nWeld Springs; and the whole body retreated to their lately deserted camp.\r\nAfter a day's rest, Alexander Forrest and a black boy started to the\r\nsouth-east searching for water. At one o'clock sixty or seventy natives\r\nappeared on the brow of the rise overlooking the camp. They were painted\r\nand dressed in war costume, and evidently planning an attack. After some\r\nconsultation they suddenly descended the slope and dashed at the camp.\r\nFortunately the whites were on the alert, and a well-directed volley sent\r\nthem in head-long retreat to their vantage-point on the brow of the\r\nridge, where they held a fresh council of war. Presently they renewed the\r\nassault, but a rifle-shot from Forrest put an end to the skirmish. That\r\nevening Alexander and the boy returned, and were much surprised to hear\r\nof the adventure with the blacks. They had been over fifty miles from\r\ncamp and had passed over some well-grassed country but had found no\r\nwater. As their detention at Weld Springs promised to be indefinite, the\r\nparty then built a rough shelter of stones in order to ensure themselves\r\nsome measure of protection against night attacks. When this small defence\r\nwork was finished, Forrest again reconnoitred ahead for water accompanied\r\nby one black boy, and found some clay waterholes, of no great extent, but\r\nsufficient for camping purposes. Thither the camp was shifted.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the leader made another search in advance, and in thirty\r\nmiles came to a fine supply of water, in a gully running through a\r\nwell-grassed plain whereon there was abundance of good feed for the\r\nhorses. To the south of this spot there was a small salt lake, which he\r\nnamed Lake Augusta. Another good spring in grassy country was also found.\r\nOn the 30th of June Forrest made a scouting excursion to the eastward,\r\nbut experienced ill fortune; for having penetrated as far as possible\r\ninto the spinifex country, his horses gave out. By the aid of some scanty\r\npools of rainwater trapped in some rocks, he succeeded in getting a short\r\ndistance farther on foot, and in reaching a low range. From its summit he\r\nobtained an extensive but depressing view, such as too often greeted the\r\nexplorer at that time and in that part of Australia. Far away to the\r\nnorth and east, the grey horizon was as level and as uniform as the\r\nplacid sea; spinifex everywhere, unbroken by ranges or elevations within\r\nover thirty miles.\r\n\r\nHe was now worried and perplexed as to the direction of his future\r\nmovements. The main party were following up his tracks; but to plunge\r\nunthinkingly into such a desert as lay in front of them were sheer\r\nmadness. Fate relented, however, and after much toilsome search Forrest\r\nfound a small supply of water, enough for a few days, where he gratefully\r\nawaited the approach of his companions.\r\n\r\nDuring the short respite thus accorded them, a diligent search for water\r\nwas made amongst the low ranges, the only alternative being a retreat of\r\nseventy miles. A little more water was found to the south-east, and, as\r\nthere was coarse rough grass around the well, it helped to prolong their\r\nrest and afforded more time for further search. This time Alexander\r\nForrest went ahead, and twenty-five miles further to the eastward found a\r\nspring, which was named after him, the Alexander Springs.\r\n\r\nAnother scouting excursion to the east was likewise fortunate, as far as\r\nwater was concerned, but the feed for the horses was very poor indeed,\r\nand they were suffering greatly. They were now within one hundred miles\r\nof Gosse's furthest point west, but that hundred miles was one long line\r\nof desert perils. Repeated efforts to traverse it only reduced the little\r\nremaining strength in the horses, leading to no discovery of water. But\r\nat length a kindly shower filled some rock holes to the north-east of\r\ntheir camp, and after much exertion and hardship they reached the old\r\ncamp that Giles had named Fort Mueller, and were able to congratulate\r\nthemselves upon having been the first to bridge the central gap of desert\r\nthat separated the two colonies.\r\n\r\nAs the course of Forrest's party from Fort Mueller to the telegraph line\r\nwas more or less the same as that pursued by Gosse, it is unnecessary to\r\nfollow the journal to its end. It is enough to state that on Sunday, the\r\n27th of September, the telegraph line was reached at a point some\r\ndistance to the north of the Peake station. Thus safely concluded an\r\nexpedition that makes a mark in our geographical history, although it was\r\naccompanied by no notable discovery. Central Australia had now been\r\ncrossed in the same zone that had turned back the explorers from the\r\neast, and the fact that Forrest got through, equipped with only the\r\nordinary outfit of horses stamped him as a leader of unusual foresight\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\nForrest's last expedition was rather a survey than a journey of\r\ndiscovery. In 1883, in company with several other surveyors, he landed at\r\nRoebuck Bay, and examined a large portion of the Kimberley Division. He\r\nproceeded from Roebuck Bay to the Fitzroy River, which his brother had\r\nlately explored, and examined the intermediate country as far as St.\r\nGeorge's Range, reporting that it consisted mainly of rich elevated\r\ngrassy plains with abundance of water. He also investigated Cambridge\r\nGulf and the lowest part of the Ord River.\r\n\r\nAfter quitting the field of exploration, John Forrest entered the wider\r\narena of politics, in which his reputation was enhanced. He held the\r\noffice of Premier of Western Australia continuously for ten years, and he\r\nstill fills a distinguished position among the public men of federated\r\nAustralia. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety in 1876, and is now a G.C.M.G. and a Privy Councillor.\r\n\r\n19.3. ALEXANDER FORREST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Alexander Forrest.]\r\n\r\nAlexander Forrest was born in 1849, and died in 1901. He accompanied\r\nhis brother, as we have already noted, in two important expeditions, and\r\nin 1871 he took charge of a private expedition to the eastward in search\r\nof pastoral country. Owing to a late start, he and his party were\r\ncompelled to make for the coast when they had reached latitude 31 degrees\r\nsouth, longitude 123 degrees east. This course led them to Mount Ragged,\r\nwhence, proceeding westerly, they returned to Perth by way of Esperance,\r\nhaving penetrated inland six hundred miles and found a considerable area\r\nof good country.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Alexander Forrest led an expedition from the De Grey River to\r\nthe now customary goal, the overland telegraph line of South Australia.\r\nHe left the De Grey on the 25th of February, and reached Beagle Bay on\r\nthe 10th of April, the country passed over being like most land in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the coast, poor and indifferent.\r\n\r\nFrom Beagle Bay he followed the coast round to the Fitzroy, and proceeded\r\nup that river until he encountered a range, which was named the King\r\nLeopold Range. Here the party left the Fitzroy, of which river Forrest\r\nspeaks very highly, and struck north, looking for a pass through the\r\nrange. It proved to be very rough and precipitous, and when at last they\r\nreached the sea, they found themselves in an angle, wedged in between the\r\nsea and the range, romantic and picturesque, according to Forrest's\r\ndescription, but quite impassible. Here, too, the natives approached them\r\nin threatening numbers, but through the exercise of tact, peace was\r\npreserved. On the 22nd of June they attacked one tier of the range, and\r\nafter a steep climb, which caused the death of one horse, they reached\r\nthe height of 800 feet and camped. Finding it so hard upon the horses,\r\nForrest left them to rest, and went on foot to discover a road. But he\r\ncame upon endless rugged zigzags, which so involved and baffled him that\r\nhe gave it up in despair, and returned. He had now, most reluctantly, to\r\nabandon the idea of surmounting the range, and to make for the Fitzroy\r\nonce more. Following up the Margaret, a tributary of the Fitzroy, he\r\nmanaged to work round the southern end of the range, which still frowned\r\ndefiance at him, and at last reached the summit, the crest of a\r\ntableland, whence he saw before him good grassy hills and plains. Of this\r\ncountry, which he called Nicholson Plains, Forrest speaks most\r\nenthusiastically, and doubtless, after the late struggle with the range,\r\nit must have appeared a perfect picture of enchantment.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th they reached a fine river, which was then running strong.\r\nThey named it the Ord, and followed its course for a time. Thence he\r\ncontinued his way to the line, and on the 18th of August came to the\r\nVictoria River. From the Victoria, Forrest had a hard struggle to reach\r\nthe telegraph line. The rations being nearly exhausted, and one man being\r\nvery ill, the leader started for Daly Waters station, taking one man with\r\nhim. After much suffering and privation they at last reached the line,\r\nand obtained water at some tanks kept for the use of the line repairers.\r\nThe absence of a map of the line led Forrest to follow it north, away\r\nfrom Daly Waters, and it was four days before they overtook a repairing\r\nparty and obtained food.\r\n\r\nAlexander Forrest was afterwards for many years a member of the\r\nLegislative Council of West Australia, was for six years Mayor of Perth\r\nand a C.M.G. He died on the 20th June, 1901. A bronze statue was\r\nerected to his memory in Perth, Western Australia, by his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20. LATER EXPLORATION IN THE WEST.\r\n\r\n[ Illustration. Carr-Boyd and Camel. Photographed at Laverton, Western\r\nAustralia, October, 1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20.1. CAMBRIDGE GULF AND THE KIMBERLEY DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe futile rush for gold to the Kimberley district had one good result --\r\na better appreciation of its pastoral capabilities, and numerous short\r\nexpeditions were made in search of grazing country.\r\n\r\nAmongst these was one by W.J. O'Donnell and W. Carr-Boyd, who explored an\r\narea extending from the overland line in the direction of Roebourne, and\r\nwere fortunate in finding good country. Later, in 1896, Carr-Boyd,\r\naccompanied by a companion named David Breardon, who was afterwards out\r\nwith David Carnegie, visited the country about the Rawlinson Ranges and\r\npenetrated to Forrest's Alexander Spring. His name is also known in\r\nconnection with exploration in the Northern Territory, and he has made\r\nseveral excursions between the Southern goldfields of West Australia and\r\nthe South Australian border.\r\n\r\nHis experiences were not unlike those of the other explorers; he had to\r\nstruggle on against heat, thirst, and spinifex, and found occasional\r\ntracts of pastoral land destitute of surface water.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Harry Stockdale, an experienced bushman, started from Cambridge\r\nGulf in order to investigate the country to the southward, and explore\r\nthe land in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nFrom the Gulf southward, he traversed well-watered and diversified\r\ncountry till he reached Buchanan's Creek, which must be distinguished\r\nfrom the stream of the same name in the Northern Territory of South\r\nAustralia.* Having formed a depot there, he hoped to make further\r\nexplorations, but owing to certain irregularities which had occurred\r\namong his followers in his absence on a flying trip, he was compelled to\r\nstart immediately for his destination on the overland line. A very\r\nsingular incident happened during this latter part of his journey. Two of\r\nthe men, named Mulcay and Ashton desired, under the plea of sickness, to\r\nbe left behind, and resisted every attempt to turn them from their\r\npurpose. Stockdale reached the line after suffering great hardship, but\r\nthe fate of the two abandoned men eluded all subsequent search.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] See Chapter 16.\r\n\r\n20.2. LINDSAY AND THE ELDER EXPLORING EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Sir Thomas Elder, G.C.M.G. Photo: Duryea, Adelaide.\r\n\r\nIllustration. David Lindsay.]\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Sir Thomas Elder of South Australia, who had already done much in\r\nthe cause of exploration, projected another expedition on a large and\r\nmost ambitious plan. It was called The Elder Exploring Scientific\r\nExpedition, and its main purpose was announced to be the completion of\r\nthe exploration of Australia. A map was prepared on which a huge extent\r\nof the continent was partitioned off into blocks each bearing a\r\ndistinctive letter, A, B, C, D, etc., quite irrespective of the fact that\r\nall these blocks had been partially explored and that some had even been\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe leadership of the party was offered to and accepted by David Lindsay,\r\nwho had already won for himself a name as a capable explorer in South\r\nAustralia. The second in charge was L.A. Wells. As the expedition was in\r\nthe main destitute of any striking results, a short synopsis of the\r\njourney will satisfy our requirements.\r\n\r\nShortly after the expedition crossed the border-line between South\r\nAustralia and West Australia, Mr. Leech, one of the responsible officers,\r\nwas despatched on a fruitless trip northward to search for traces of the\r\nill-fated Gibson, who had perished with Giles some seventeen years\r\npreviously. The expedition then proceeded via Fort Mueller to Mount\r\nSquires, where water was obtainable. Thence a south-west course was taken\r\nto Queen Victoria's Spring. In latitude 29 degrees, 270 miles south of\r\nMount Squires, the eastern end of a patch of good pastoral country was\r\nobserved. On reaching the springs they were found to be dry, and all the\r\nintended exploration which was to be effected from this base had to be\r\nabandoned, the party having to push on to Fraser's Range; and this hasty\r\ntrip through the desert comprised the only useful work done. Lindsay\r\nreported that, when half-way to the Range, they passed some good country\r\nconsisting of rich red soil, producing good stock bushes but all\r\nexceedingly dry. A belt of country deserving the attention of prospectors\r\nwas also noted. Having rested some time at the Range, they set out to\r\nexamine, if possible, the western side of the desert they had just\r\ntraversed, but lack of water compelled them to take an extreme westerly\r\ncourse to the Murchison by way of Mount Monger, passing through a country\r\ncovered with miserable thicket on a sandy soil with granite outcrops. On\r\nthe 1st of January, 1892, they reached their destination, when the\r\nmajority of the members left the party, and the leader was recalled to\r\nAdelaide.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the original expedition, or rather before its\r\nconclusion was absolutely determined on, L.A. Wells made a flying trip\r\ninto the district lying between Giles's track of 1876 and Forrest's route\r\nof 1874. Starting from his depot at Welbundinum, he completed the\r\nexamination of what was practically the whole of the still unexplored\r\nportion in about six weeks, between the 23rd of February and the 4th of\r\nApril. During this expedition he travelled 834 miles, discovered some\r\nfine ranges and hills, a large extent of pastoral country, some\r\napparently auriferous land, but no water of a permanent kind. The results\r\nwere indeed very promising, more valuable than those of the original\r\nElder Expedition, and Wells, whose hopes had risen with the success, was\r\nintensely disappointed to find on his return that the expedition had been\r\ndisbanded. Both Lindsay and Wells were natives of South Australia,\r\nLindsay having been born at Goolwa, and Wells at Yallum station in the\r\nsouth-east, which was owned by his father and uncle. Wells joined the\r\nSurvey Department of South Australia when but eighteen, and at\r\ntwenty-three was appointed assistant-surveyor to the North Territory\r\nBorder expedition. On the settlement of the border question he returned\r\nto Adelaide, and is now engaged on the Victoria River.\r\n\r\n20.3. WELLS AND CARNEGIE IN THE NORTHERN DESERT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. L.A. Wells. Photo: Duryea, Adelaide.]\r\n\r\nBy this time the gold rush to the southern portion of Western Australia\r\nhad set in strong, and the country that had so long repelled the pastoral\r\npioneer by its aridity was now overrun with prospectors, their camps\r\nsupplied with water by condensers at the salt lakes and pools. At first\r\nthe loss of life was very great; for it was not likely that a district\r\nthat could be safely traversed only by the hardiest and most experienced\r\nbushmen would freely yield its secrets to untried men. Of the many deaths\r\nthat occurred from thirst, no complete record will ever be available.\r\nSome unrecognisable and mummified remains may some day be found amid the\r\nuntrodden waste; but few have yet been tempted to break in upon the\r\nsolitude of the dead men of the desert.\r\n\r\nAs the southern goldfields spread and became thickly-populated, the food\r\nsupply was an important question, and men's eyes naturally turned to the\r\nwell-stocked northern stations, from which many cattle were being sent\r\nsouth by steamer. Though the distance overland was not prohibitive, the\r\nbelt of desert country that intervened, upon which Warburton to his\r\nsorrow was the first to venture, forbade the passage of stock. This belt\r\nof Sahara extended, roughly speaking, from the eastern border of the\r\ncolony to the head waters of the western coastal rivers. North and south\r\nit lay between the parallels of 19 degrees and 31 degrees south. As yet\r\nno daring attempt had been made to traverse its barren confines from\r\nsouth to north. But, to the born explorer, difficulty and danger give an\r\nadded zest to geographical research; and in the year 1896 two separate\r\nexpeditions sought to cross this dreadful zone. Both left civilization\r\nwithin a few days of each other. The first to start was known as the\r\nCalvert Expedition, from its originator. It was under L.A. Wells, the\r\nSouth Australian surveyor who had been the energetic second of the former\r\nElder Expedition. The other was equipped and led by the Honourable David\r\nCarnegie.\r\n\r\nWells formed a depot at a spot well provided with camel feed and water,\r\nat some distance to the south-west of Forrest's Lake Augusta, which he\r\nfound, at that time, dry. Here he left the main part of his caravan to\r\nawait his return whilst he made a flying trip to the north. He was away\r\nfrom the 10th of August to the 8th of September, during which he found at\r\nhis furthest point, a distance of two hundred miles, a good native well,\r\nwhich he named Midway Well. On the 14th of September the whole party made\r\na start, and reached Midway Well on the 29th, all well. At Separation\r\nWell, another good well a little farther to the north, the party\r\nseparated, C.F. Wells, a cousin of the leader, and G.L. Jones, intending\r\nto travel for about eighty miles in a north-west direction to examine the\r\ncountry, and then to return on a north-east course and rejoin the caravan\r\nat Joanna Springs, which had relieved Warburton in his extremity. About\r\nthirty miles south of Joanna Springs, where the leader expected the two\r\nmen to cut his tracks, Wells found his camels suffering terribly from the\r\nextreme heat and their labours among the constantly-recurring\r\nsand-ridges, whilst the scanty native wells they found were insufficient\r\nto give their camels water. When at last they reached the latitude of\r\nJoanna Springs they had been obliged to abandon three camels and all\r\ntheir equipment except the actual necessaries.\r\n\r\nIt was also evident that the longitude of the springs given by Warburton\r\nwas wrong, for all the country around was a sandy desert without the\r\nslightest indication of well or spring. To linger in such a spot was to\r\ncourt destruction, and they had to push on to the Fitzroy as fast as\r\ntheir worn-out camels could take them. The reader will remember that\r\nWarburton had failed to find A.C. Gregory's most southerly point on\r\nSturt's Creek when looking for it, and it was afterwards proved that\r\nJoanna Springs had been charted by him about ten miles to the westward of\r\nits true position. On the 7th of November, in the darkness of morning\r\nthey at last reached the Fitzroy, with the camels just at their last\r\ngasp.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of December, Wells, accompanied by that veteran pioneer N.\r\nBuchanan, formerly of Queensland, started back with an Afghan, a native\r\nboy, and eight camels, to look for the two men, who he hoped had\r\nsucceeded in finding Joanna Springs. He was absent until the 10th of\r\nJanuary, 1897, when he was forced to return unsuccessful. At the\r\nbeginning of April, taking with him his former companions of the\r\nexpedition, Wells renewed the search, and on the 9th at last succeeded in\r\nidentifying the Joanna Springs of Warburton. On the 13th some articles\r\nbelonging to the lost men were found amongst the natives, but he did not\r\nat that time find the bodies. He started again with two members of the\r\nWest Australia police force, Sub-Inspector Ord and Trooper Nicholson, and\r\nnative trackers. This time they were successful in inducing some natives\r\nto guide them to the exact spot where the remains lay amongst the\r\nspinifex and sand. The bodies were within six miles of the place where,\r\non the last search expedition, Wells had found articles of equipment with\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\nG.L. Jones had kept a journal which supplied the clue to the cause of\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\n\"He stated in his journal,\" says Wells, \"that they had gone\r\nwest-north-west for five days after separating from the main party, then\r\ntravelling a short distance north-east, and that both he and Charles felt\r\nthe heat terribly and were both unwell. They then returned to the well\r\n(Separation Well) after an absence of nine days, rested at the water five\r\ndays, and then started to follow our tracks northward. Afterwards one of\r\ntheir camels died, which obliged them to walk a great deal, and they\r\nbecame very weak and exhausted by the intense heat. When writing he says\r\nthat two days previously he attempted to follow their camels, which had\r\nstrayed, but after walking half-a-mile he felt too weak to proceed and\r\nreturned with difficulty. There was at that time about two quarts of\r\nwater remaining to them, and he did not think they could last long after\r\nthat was finished.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the above extract from Wells's Journal, it is evident that the\r\nunfortunate men lost their lives through a mistake in judgment in\r\nreturning to Separation Well, the straying away of their camels, and the\r\nmerciless rays of the desert sun.\r\n\r\nThe account of this, the first expedition to cross the great sandy desert\r\nfrom south to north, confirms in every particular Warburton's experiences\r\nof the difficulties of exploration in that region. The intense heat of\r\nthe sun, and its radiation from the red sand-ridges, the heat from both\r\nsky and earth, render it nearly impossible to travel during day, the only\r\ntime when a man can perceive those slight indications which may\r\neventually lead him to water. The traveller is therefore compelled to\r\nmake night-stages, and frequently passes unheeding the very pool or well\r\nthat would have saved his life. During the night not only are the natural\r\nphysical features difficult to discern, but the birds, those water-guides\r\nof the desert, are sleeping.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news that Jones and Wells were missing was wired to Perth,\r\nthe West Australian Government promptly despatched W.P. Rudall in charge\r\nof a search-party, from Braeside station on the Oakover River.\r\n\r\nCrossing into the desert country, Rudall, guided by blacks, came upon a\r\ncamp in which footsteps, supposed to be those of the missing men, were\r\ntraceable. His camels failing him, the tracks were lost, and he was\r\nobliged to return. A second search was likewise fruitless, but rumours\r\nbrought in by the natives of straying camels, caused a third party to be\r\norganised. Rudall this time went south of the head of the Oakover, and\r\npenetrated the dry spinifex country below the Tropic. Here the bodies of\r\ntwo men, supposed to have been murdered by the natives, were found, but\r\non further investigation it was decided that the remains were not those\r\nof the men they were searching for. On his return Rudall started out on a\r\nfinal trip, and penetrated to a point sixty miles south of Joanna Spring\r\nbefore returning. Though these journeys were not successful in attaining\r\nthe initial object of their search, they were of great service in gaining\r\nmuch information concerning the hitherto unknown desert. Running easterly\r\ninto this dry belt, Rudall found a creek, which is now known as the\r\nRudall River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. David Wynford Carnegie.]\r\n\r\nFour days after Wells had started, the Honourable David Carnegie, fourth\r\nson of the ninth Earl of Southesk, born March 23rd, 1871, left an outpost\r\nof civilization called Doyle's Well, some fifty miles south of Lake\r\nDarlot, intending to cross Warburton's Desert on a north-easterly course,\r\nabout two hundred miles to the east of the route pursued by surveyor\r\nWells. The objects of this purely private expedition were (1) extension\r\nof geographical knowledge; (2) the desire to ascertain if any practicable\r\nstock-route existed between Kimberley and Coolgardie; (3) the discovery\r\nof patches of auriferous country within the confines of the desert. In\r\nthe two last objects Carnegie was doomed to disappointment, but as a\r\ngeographical contribution to our scanty knowledge of north-west\r\nAustralia, the outcome of his repeated journey was distinctly valuable.\r\n\r\nCarnegie started with three white men and a native boy, and for many days\r\npassed through country that afforded no water for the camels; of which\r\nthey had nine. A native was induced to lead them to a singular spring\r\nsituated in a cavern twenty-five feet underground. Though the water was\r\nnot easy of access, having to be hauled up by bucket to the surface,\r\nthere was an ample supply for the camels, and, as Carnegie considered the\r\nwell to be permanent, he named it the Empress Spring.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this subterranean spring was indeed a godsend, as when\r\nthey eventually reached Forrest's Alexander Spring they found it dry. A\r\nsimilar experience had befallen W.W. Mills who, after Forrest's\r\nexploration, had attempted to take over a mob of camels in Forrest's\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough a lagoon of fresh water was found at the foot of the\r\ncreek in which the spring was situated, and this satisfied their wants.\r\nFrom this sheet, which was named Woodhouse Lagoon, the party kept a\r\nnearly northerly course across what Carnegie calls in his book \"the great\r\nundulating desert of gravel.\" Over this terrible region of drought and\r\ndesolation the party made their painful way by the aid of miserable\r\nnative wells, found with the greatest difficulty, and a few chance\r\npatches of parakeelia,* until they were relieved by finding, through the\r\ngood offices of an aboriginal guide, a beautiful spring which was named\r\nHelena Spring. They were then seven days out from Woodhouse Lagoon, and\r\nduring the last days of the stage they had been travelling across most\r\ndistressing parallel sand-ridges.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote.] A ground plant which camels eat, and which assuages their\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nFrom Helena Spring Carnegie struggled on, intending to strike the\r\nnorthern settlements at Hall's Creek where there is a small mining\r\ntownship. On the way there, while still in unexplored country, they\r\ndiscovered one more oasis, in a rock hole, which was called Godfrey's\r\nTank, after Godfrey Massie, one of the party. On November 25th, 1896,\r\nthey congratulated themselves that they were at last clear of the desert\r\nand its desolation, having come out on to a well-watered shady river,\r\nrunning towards the northern coast. But a sad accident turned their\r\nrejoicing into mourning. Charles Stansmore accidentally slipped on a rock\r\nwhen out shooting, and his gun going off, he was shot through the heart\r\nand died instantly. His friend Carnegie speaks most highly of him, and\r\nhis sudden death on the threshold of success was a sad blow to the\r\ncompany. Stansmore was the third explorer to lose his life from a gun\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nAt Hall's Creek Carnegie heard of the misfortune that had befallen Wells,\r\nin the loss of two of his party, and he at once volunteered his\r\nassistance; but as search-parties had already started out, his aid was\r\nnot required. He therefore rested for a short time before again trying\r\nconclusions with the desert on the return journey. Sturt's Creek was by\r\nthis time occupied and stocked, and the party followed it down until they\r\narrived at its termination in Gregory's Salt Sea. From this point\r\nCarnegie kept a southerly course to Lake Macdonald near the South\r\nAustralian border, passing on his way a striking range which he named the\r\nStansmore Range, after his unfortunate companion. Lake Macdonald was long\r\nthought to be a continuation of Lake Amadeus, until the exploration of\r\nTietkins in 1889 proved its isolation. From Lake Macdonald, Carnegie, who\r\nhad now three horses in his equipment, kept a more south-westerly course\r\ntowards the Rawlinson Range, the endless sand-dunes still crossing his\r\ntrack in dreary succession. So persistently did they rise across his path\r\nthat, on one day, eighty-six of them were crossed by the caravan during a\r\nprogress of eight hours. From the Rawlinson Range they kept on the same\r\nsouth-west course until they struck their outward track at Alexander\r\nSpring. A fall of rain fortunately replenished the spring shortly after\r\nthe arrival of the party. They reached Lake Darlot on the 15th of July,\r\nand their desert pilgrimage was ended.\r\n\r\nNot only did Carnegie get safely across the dreaded desert, but he\r\nreturned overland to his starting-point by a different route. He wrote a\r\nbook, Spinifex and Sand, which contains a most interesting account of\r\nthis journey, as well as a graphic and picturesque description of the\r\nphysical features of the Great Sandy Desert.\r\n\r\nCarnegie died before he had made more than this one contribution to\r\nAustralian geography. Like the ill-fated Horrocks, he had the explorer's\r\nardent spirit. His restless and adventurous soul ever leading him onward\r\nto the frontiers of settlement and the outskirts of civilised life, he\r\nfell beneath a shower of poisoned arrows at Lokojo in Nigeria, on the\r\nwest coast of Africa, on the 27th of November, 1900.\r\n\r\n20.4. HANN AND BROCKMAN IN THE NORTH-WEST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Frank Hann. Explorer of the North-West, and discoverer of\r\na stock route between South Australia and Western Australia. Photo:\r\nMathewson, Brisbane.]\r\n\r\nThe isolation of that remote corner of the continent in which Grey had\r\nmade his maiden effort at exploration, added to the discouraging and\r\nforbidding report brought back by Alexander Forrest of his repulse by the\r\nKing Leopold Range, had deterred further exploration there. Frank H.\r\nHann, who had been a Queensland pioneer, came over to Derby, and, after\r\none or two tentative excursions into the desert country to the south, had\r\nhis attention drawn to the unknown country to the north of the King\r\nLeopold Range. Hann crossed the range with difficulty; but after\r\nexamining the country to the north and east on the coast side of the\r\nrange, he was so well satisfied with its pastoral capabilities that he\r\nreturned to Derby and applied for a pastoral lease.\r\n\r\nWishing to make a closer examination of the locality, he returned\r\naccompanied by Sub-Inspector Ord. Some of the tributaries of the Fitzroy\r\nwere traced and named, and an extensive river, which Hann called the\r\nPhillips, was afterwards re-named the Hann by the Surveyor-General of\r\nWestern Australia. One very rugged range could not be surmounted, and had\r\nto be skirted to the east, as the only apparent gap was an impassable\r\ngorge with precipitous sides, through which the Fitzroy River forced a\r\npassage. It was named the Sir John Range. After more good pastoral\r\ncountry was found, the party returned to Derby. Hann afterwards, in 1903,\r\nmade the first of several trips from Laverton, Western Australia, to\r\nOodnadatta in South Australia. He reported having found a practicable\r\nstock-route, of which he was chiefly in search, as far as the Warburton\r\nRanges, and some pastoral land north and west of Elder Creek. Since then\r\nhe made another journey with the same object in view, but encountered\r\nextremely dry weather and underwent many hardships. Hann was born in\r\nWiltshire, in 1846, and came to Victoria with his parents at a very early\r\nage. He spent most of his life squatting in North Queensland, where he\r\nheld several station properties.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the present century the Western Australian\r\nGovernment followed up Hann's explorations north of the King Leopold\r\nRange, by a larger and better-equipped party instructed to make a\r\nthorough examination of the region. It was placed in charge of F.S.\r\nBrockman, a Government surveyor, who had with him C. Crossland as second,\r\nF. House as naturalist, and Gibbs Maitland as geologist.\r\n\r\nBrockman was born in Western Australia in 1857, was educated at Bishop's\r\nCollege, and after a spell in the bush on his father's properties, he\r\njoined a Government Survey camp, as cadet. In 1879 he started as surveyor\r\non his own account. From 1882 to 1897 he was employed by the Lands and\r\nSurvey Department in many parts of Western Australia from Cambridge Gulf\r\nin the north to the Great Bight in the south. At the time when he was\r\nselected to lead the Kimberley expedition, he was Controller of the Field\r\nSurvey Staff.\r\n\r\nBrockman was most successful in securing full information of this\r\nlong-secluded region; of its geographical, geological, and botanical\r\ndetails. Many interesting photographs were obtained of the different\r\nphysical features and of the aborigines and their modes of life; amongst\r\nthem being views of rock paintings similar to the mysterious scenes\r\nnoticed by Grey during his first expedition to the Glenelg River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Aboriginal Rock Painting on the Glenelg River. From a\r\nphotograph by F.S. Brockman.]\r\n\r\nThe party left Wyndham on Cambridge Gulf and proceeded first southwards\r\nand then to the westward to the Charnley River, which had been discovered\r\nby Frank Hann. The tributary waters of the Glenelg and Prince Regent\r\nRivers, and the tidal rivers that flow into Collier and Doubtful Bays\r\nwere also visited, and Brockman traced the Roe River from its source to\r\nits outflow in Prince Frederick Harbour. The Moran River was discovered,\r\nand its whole course traced to the mouth in the same inlet. The head\r\nwaters of the King Edward River were discovered at the watershed; and\r\nthis river was again met lower down and its course traced to its exit.\r\nPortions of the shores of Admiralty Gulf, Vansittart, and Napier Broome\r\nBay were closely examined with a view to selecting a suitable port for\r\nthe district. The most important practical result of the expedition was\r\nthe discovery of an area of six million acres of basaltic pastoral\r\ncountry covered with blue grass, Mitchell and kangaroo grasses, and many\r\nvarieties of what is known as top feed. No auriferous country was found,\r\nbut some fine specimens of the baobab tree were seen, some of them\r\naveraging fifty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration. Typical Australian Explorers of the early Twentieth\r\nCentury.]\r\n\r\nWe have now turned the last page of the story of those bold spirits who\r\nplayed no mean part in the making of Australasia by exploring the\r\ncontinent. For nearly a century and a quarter the white man had been\r\nrestlessly searching out and traversing every square mile of the land,\r\nand now, at the beginning of the twentieth century, his work is finished.\r\nAnd throughout the long struggle it had ever been a stubborn conflict\r\nbetween the explorer and the inert forces of Nature. Through the weary\r\ntoilsome years of arduous discovery, Man and Nature had seldom marched\r\nside by side as friends and allies. When Nature posed as the explorer's\r\nfriend and guide, it was often only to lure him on with a smiling face to\r\nhis doom. From the days when the soldier of King George the Third went\r\nforth with his firelock on his shoulder, computing the distance he\r\ncovered by wearily counting the number of paces he trudged, to the day\r\nwhen the modern adventurer aloft on his camel eagerly scans the horizon\r\nof the red desert in search of the distant smoke of a native fire, and\r\nthen patiently tracks the naked denizen of the wilderness to his hoarded\r\nrock-hole or scanty spring, the explorer has ever had to fight the battle\r\nof discovery unaided by Nature. The aborigines generally either feigned\r\nignorance of the nature of the country, or gave only false clues and\r\nmisguiding directions. Even the birds and animals of the untrodden\r\nregions seemed to resent the advance of civilization, and to delight in\r\nleading the footsteps of the white intruder astray. Hence it was by slow\r\ndegrees, by careful study of the work of his predecessors in the field,\r\nand often by heeding the warning conveyed in their unhappy fate, that the\r\nAustralian explorer added to the sum of knowledge of his country, and\r\nstep by step unveiled the hidden mysteries of the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF NAMES OF
