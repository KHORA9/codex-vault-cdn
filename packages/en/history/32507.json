In many an humble home, perhaps in some\r\nEnglish village, or an Ulster farm, or in the Rhine valley, one might\r\nfind a family assembled for the reading of a letter from son, or\r\nbrother, or friend, who had made the great venture of going to the New\r\nWorld. \"Land is abundant here and cheap,\" the letter would state. \"Wages\r\nare high, food is plentiful, farmers live better than lords. If one will\r\nwork only five days a week one can live grandly.\"\r\n\r\nIn pamphlets intended to encourage immigration the opportunities for\r\nadvancement were set forth in glowing colors. In Virginia alone, it was\r\nstated, in 1649, there were \"of kine, oxen, bulls, calves, twenty\r\nthousand, large and good.\" When the traveller Welby came to America he\r\nwas surprised to \"see no misery, no disgusting army of paupers, not even\r\nbeggars;\" while Henry B. Fearson noted that laborers were \"more erect in\r\ntheir posture, less careworn in their countenances\" than those of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, as in other colonies, it was the cheapness of land and the\r\ndearness of labor which gave the newcomer his chance to rise. The rich\r\nman might possess many thousands of acres, but they would profit him\r\nnothing unless he could find the labor to put them under cultivation.\r\nIndentured workers met his needs in part, but they were expensive, hard\r\nto acquire, and served for only four years. If he hired freemen he\r\nwould have to pay wages which in England would have seemed fantastic.\r\n\r\nThus the so-called servants who had completed their terms and men who\r\nhad come over as freemen found it easy to earn enough to buy small\r\nplantations of their own. That thousands did so is shown by the Rent\r\nRoll which is published as an appendix to this book. One has only to\r\nglance at it to see that the large plantations are vastly outnumbered by\r\nthe small farms of the yeomen. It proves that Virginia at the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century was not the land of huge estates, worked by\r\nservants and slaves, but of a numerous, prosperous middle class.\r\n\r\nOwning plantations of from fifty to five hundred acres, cultivating\r\ntheir fields of tobacco, their patches of Indian corn and wheat, their\r\nvegetable gardens and orchards with their own labor or the labor of\r\ntheir sons, the yeomen enjoyed a sense of independence and dignity. It\r\nwas their votes which determined the character of the Assembly, it was\r\nthey who resisted most strongly all assaults upon the liberties of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAs the small farmer, after the day's work was over, sat before his\r\ncottage smoking his long clay pipe, he could reflect that for him the\r\ncountry had fulfilled its promise. The land around him was his own; his\r\ntobacco brought in enough for him to purchase clothes, farm implements,\r\nand household goods.\r\n\r\nBut he frowned as he thought of the slave ship which had come into the\r\nnearby river, and landed a group of Negroes who were all bought by his\r\nwealthy neighbors. If Virginia were flooded with slaves, would it not\r\ncheapen production and lower the price of tobacco? Could he and his\r\nsons, when they hoed their fields with their own hands, compete with\r\nslave labor?\r\n\r\nThe event fully justified these fears. The yeoman class in Virginia was\r\ndoomed. In the face of the oncoming tide they had three alternatives--to\r\nsave enough money to buy a slave or two, to leave the country, or to\r\nsink into poverty.\r\n\r\nIt was the acquiring of a few slaves by the small planter which saved\r\nthe middle class. Before the end of the colonial period a full fifty per\r\ncent. of the slaveholders had from one to five only. Seventy-five per\r\ncent. had less than ten. The small farmer, as he led his newly acquired\r\nslaves from the auction block to his plantation may have regretted that\r\nself-preservation had forced him to depend on their labor rather than\r\nhis own. But he could see all around him the fate of those who had no\r\nslaves, as they became \"poor white trash.\" And he must have looked on\r\nwith pity as a neighbor gathered up his meager belongings and, deserting\r\nhis little plantation, set out for the remote frontier.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the great crimes of history, this undermining of the\r\nyeoman class by the importation of slaves. The wrong done to the Negro\r\nhimself has been universally condemned; the wrong done the white man has\r\nattracted less attention. It effectively deprived him of his American\r\nbirthright--the high return for his labor. It transformed Virginia and\r\nthe South from a land of hard working, self-respecting, independent\r\nyeomen, to a land of slaves and slaveholders.\r\n\r\n  _Princeton, New Jersey_              THOMAS J.

Because of the depletion of\r\nher forests, which constituted perhaps the most important of her natural\r\nresources, she could no longer look for prosperity from the old\r\nindustries that for centuries had been her mainstay. In the days when\r\nthe Norman conquerors first set foot upon English soil the virgin woods,\r\nbroken occasionally by fields and villages, had stretched in dense\r\nformation from the Scottish border to Sussex and Devonshire. But with\r\nthe passage of five centuries a great change had been wrought. The\r\ngrowing population, the expansion of agriculture, the increasing use of\r\nwood for fuel, for shipbuilding, and for the construction of houses, had\r\nby the end of the Tudor period so denuded the forests that they no\r\nlonger sufficed for the most pressing needs of the country.\r\n\r\nEven at the present day it is universally recognized that a certain\r\nproportion of wooded land is essential to the prosperity and\r\nproductivity of any country. And whenever this is lacking, not only do\r\nthe building, furniture, paper and other industries suffer, but the\r\nrainfall proves insufficient, spring floods are frequent and the\r\nfertility of the soil is impaired by washing. These misfortunes are\r\nslight, however, compared with the disastrous results of the gradual\r\nthinning out of the forests of Elizabethan England. The woods were\r\nnecessary for three all-important industries, the industries upon\r\nwhich the prosperity and wealth of the nation were largely\r\ndependent--shipbuilding, for which were needed timber, masts, pitch,\r\ntar, resin; the manufacture of woolens, calling for a large supply of\r\npotash; smelting of all kinds, since three hundred years ago wood and\r\nnot coal was the fuel used in the furnaces. It was with the deepest\r\napprehension, then, that thoughtful Englishmen watched the gradual\r\nreduction of the forest areas, for it seemed to betoken for their\r\ncountry a period of declining prosperity and economic decay. \"When\r\ntherefore our mils of Iron and excesse of building have already turned\r\nour greatest woods into pasture and champion within these few years,\"\r\nsays a writer of this period, \"neither the scattered forests of England,\r\nnor the diminished groves of Ireland will supply the defect of our\r\nnavy.\"[1-1]\r\n\r\nFrom this intolerable situation England sought relief through foreign\r\ncommerce. If she could no longer smelt her own iron, if she could not\r\nproduce ship-stores or burn her own wood ashes, these things might be\r\nprocured from countries where the forests were still extensive,\r\ncountries such as those bordering the Baltic--Germany, Poland, Russia,\r\nSweden. And so the vessels of the Muscovy Company in the second half of\r\nthe Sixteenth century passed through the Cattegat in large numbers to\r\nmake their appearance at Reval and Libau and Danzig, seeking there the\r\nraw materials so vitally necessary to England. \"Muscovia and Polina doe\r\nyeerly receive many thousands for Pitch, Tarre, Sope Ashes, Rosen, Flax,\r\nCordage, Sturgeon, Masts, Yards, Wainscot, Firres, Glasse, and such\r\nlike,\" wrote Captain John Smith, \"also Swethland for Iron and\r\nCopper.\"[1-2]\r\n\r\nBut this solution of her problem was obviously unsatisfactory to\r\nEngland. The northern voyage was long, dangerous and costly; the King of\r\nDenmark, who controlled the entrance to the Baltic, had it within his\r\npower at any moment to exclude the English traders; the Muscovy company\r\nno longer enjoyed exemption from customs in Prussia, Denmark and Russia.\r\nIn case war should break out among the northern nations this trade might\r\nfor a time be cut off entirely, resulting in strangulation for England's\r\nbasic industries. \"The merchant knoweth,\" said the author of _A True\r\nDeclaration_, \"that through the troubles in Poland & Muscovy, (whose\r\neternall warres are like the Antipathy of the Dragon & Elephant) all\r\ntheir traffique for Masts, Deales, Pitch, Tarre, Flax, Hempe, and\r\nCordage, are every day more and more indangered.\"[1-3] Moreover, the\r\ntrade was much impeded by the ice which for several months each year\r\nchoked some of the northern ports.\r\n\r\nThe most alarming aspect of this unfortunate situation was the effect of\r\nthe shortage of shipbuilding material upon the merchant marine. Situated\r\nas it was upon an island, England enjoyed communication with the nations\r\nof the world only by means of the ocean pathways. Whatever goods came to\r\nher doors, whatever goods of her own manufacture she sent to foreign\r\nmarkets, could be transported only by sea. It was a matter of vital\r\nimport to her, then, to build up and maintain a fleet of merchant\r\nvessels second to none. But this was obviously difficult if not\r\nimpossible when \"the furniture of shipping\" such as \"Masts, Cordage,\r\nPitch, Tar, Rossen\" were not produced in quantity by England itself, and\r\ncould be had \"only by the favor of forraigne potency.\"[1-4] Already, it\r\nwas stated, the decay of shipping was manifest, while large numbers of\r\nable mariners were forced to seek employment in other countries. \"You\r\nknow how many men for want of imploiment, betake themselves to Tunis,\r\nSpaine and Florence,\" declared one observer, \"and to serve in courses\r\nnot warrantable, which would better beseeme our own walles and borders\r\nto bee spread with such branches, that their native countrey and not\r\nforreine Princes might reape their fruit, as being both exquisite\r\nNavigators, and resolute men for service, as any the world affords.\"[1-5]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the merchant vessel three hundred years ago\r\nconstituted an important part of the nation's sea defence. The fleet\r\nwhich met the mighty Spanish Armada in the Channel and inflicted upon it\r\nso decisive a defeat, was made up in large part of volunteer ships from\r\nevery English port. And the Britisher knew full well that the merchant\r\nmarine constituted the \"wooden walls\" of his country, knew that its\r\ndecay would leave England almost defenseless. At the moment when one\r\nable writer was pointing out that \"the Realme of England is an Island\r\nimpossible to be otherwise fortified than by stronge shippes,\" another\r\nwas complaining that there were scarce two vessels of 100 tons belonging\r\nto the whole city of Bristol, and few or none along the Severn from\r\nGloucester to Land's End on one side, and to Milford Haven on the\r\nother.[1-6]\r\n\r\nFor this intolerable situation there could be but one remedy--England\r\nmust secure colonial possessions to supply her with the products for\r\nwhich her forests were no longer sufficient. Her bold navigators had\r\nalready crossed the Atlantic, returning with alluring stories of the\r\nlimitless resources of the New World, of mighty forests spreading in\r\nunbroken array for hundreds of miles along the coast and back into the\r\ninterior as far as the eye could see.[1-7] Why, it was asked, should\r\nEnglishmen be forced to make the hazardous journey to the Baltic in\r\norder to procure from other nations what they might easily have for\r\nthemselves by taking possession of some of the limitless unoccupied\r\nareas of America? It was folly to remain in economic bondage while the\r\nroad to independence stretched so invitingly before them.\r\n\r\nLong before the Goodspeed, the Discovery and the Sarah Constant turned\r\ntheir prows into the waters of the James, able English writers were\r\nurging upon the nation the absolute necessity for colonial expansion. In\r\n1584 the farseeing Hakluyt pointed out that the recent voyage of Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert had proved that \"pitche, tarr, rosen, sope ashes\" could\r\nbe produced in America in great plenty, \"yea, as it is thought, ynoughe\r\nto serve the whole realme.\"[1-8] Captain Christopher Carleill had the\r\nprevious year made an effort to persuade the Muscovy Company to divert\r\nits energies toward America. Why remain under the power of the King of\r\nDenmark, he asked, or other princes who \"command our shippes at their\r\npleasure,\" when all the products of the Baltic regions were to be had\r\nfrom unoccupied territories which so easily could be placed under the\r\nEnglish flag?\r\n\r\nIt has often been taken for granted that the statesmen and merchants of\r\nthree centuries ago pursued always a mistaken and shortsighted economic\r\npolicy. John Fiske assures us that even at the close of the Eighteenth\r\ncentury the barbarous superstitions of the Middle Ages concerning trade\r\nbetween nations still flourished with scarcely diminished vitality. Yet\r\nit requires but a cursory study of the theories and arguments of the\r\nElizabethan economists to realize that they were men of ability and\r\nvision, that they knew what was needed and how to procure it, that they\r\nwere nearer right than many have supposed. In fact, they acted upon\r\nsound economic principles a century and a half before Adam Smith\r\nformulated and expounded them.\r\n\r\nThese men realized keenly that England's safety demanded a larger\r\nmeasure of economic independence and they pointed out what seemed to be\r\nthe only available means of securing it. Since her forests upon which\r\nher prosperity in the past had been so largely based, were nearing the\r\npoint of exhaustion, she must expand to embrace new lands where the\r\nvirgin growth of trees stood untouched. If this is barbarous, then the\r\nrecent efforts of Italy to gain an independent coal supply, of Great\r\nBritain to get control of various oil fields, of the United States to\r\nbuild up a dye industry, are all likewise barbarous. In fact the world\r\ntoday in matters of economic policy has by no means gotten away from the\r\nconceptions of the men whose able writings cleared the way for the\r\nbeginning of the British colonial empire.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that England in this matter was concerned\r\nonly for her supply of naval stores, potash and pig iron. There were\r\nother products, not so vital it is true, but still important, which she\r\nwas forced to seek abroad. From the south of Europe came salt, sugar,\r\nwine, silk, fruits; from the Far East saltpetre and dyes, together with\r\nspices for making palatable the winter's stock of food; from Holland\r\ncame fish, from France wine and silk. And as in the Baltic, so elsewhere\r\nthe merchants of London and Bristol and Plymouth found their activities\r\nresented and their efforts blocked and thwarted.\r\n\r\nAll commerce with the dominions of the King of Spain was carried on with\r\nthe greatest difficulty. \"Our necessitie of oiles and colours for our\r\nclothinge trade being so greate,\" pointed out Hakluyt, \"he may arreste\r\nalmoste the one halfe of our navye, our traficque and recourse beinge so\r\ngreate in his dominions.\" The rich trade with the Far East was seriously\r\nhampered by the Turks, through whose territories it had to pass, and\r\noften a heavy tribute was laid upon it by the Sultan and his minions.\r\nEven after the merchants had succeeded in lading their vessels in the\r\neastern Mediterranean with goods from the Orient, they still had to run\r\nthe gauntlet of the hostile Powers who infested that sea. If they\r\nescaped the Knights of Malta, they might be captured by the corsairs of\r\nAlgeria or Tripoli.\r\n\r\nThe trade with France had also declined greatly during the closing years\r\nof the Sixteenth century. Not only had the religious wars proved a\r\ntremendous obstacle, but the government at Paris discriminated against\r\nthe woolens from England by means of custom duties, while the French\r\nworkmen were themselves manufacturing cloth of excellent quality in\r\nlarger amounts than had hitherto been thought possible. In the Low\r\nCountries the long and bitter struggle of the people against the bloody\r\nbands of Alva had wrought such destruction and had so ruined industry\r\nthat all foreign commerce had greatly declined.[1-9]\r\n\r\nThere can be no surprise, then, that many English economists felt that a\r\ncrisis had been reached, that nothing save the immediate establishment\r\nof colonies would prevent disaster. With the woolen industry declining,\r\nwith the shipbuilding centres almost idle, with able mariners deserting\r\nthe service, with the foreign market gradually closing to English wares,\r\nwith the country overrun with idle and starving laborers, with some of\r\nher chief natural resources nearly exhausted and the trade by which her\r\nneeds were replenished in constant danger, England turned to America as\r\nher hope for salvation. Upon securing a foothold in the New World,\r\nhitherto monopolized by Spain and Portugal, depended Albion's future\r\ngreatness and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is this which gave to the London Company its national character, and\r\nmade its efforts to establish a colony across the Atlantic a crusade, a\r\nmovement in which every Englishman was vitally concerned. The great\r\nlords and wealthy merchants who comprised the Company knew well enough\r\nthat there was little hope of immediate returns upon the money they\r\nsubscribed so liberally. They expected to receive their reward in\r\nanother way, in the revival of English industrial life and the\r\nrestoration of English economic independence. It is a singular\r\nperversion of history, an inaccurate interpretation of men and events,\r\nwhich for so many years beclouded our conception of the beginning of the\r\nBritish colonial empire. The settlement at Jamestown was not the product\r\nof a selfish, private venture, but the fruition of long years of thought\r\nand endeavor, long years of pleading with the English public, of the\r\nconscious and deliberate efforts of the nation to expand to the New\r\nWorld, to break the bonds of economic dependence and to restore to\r\nEngland the place in the world which rightfully was hers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to, but closely associated with, the economic causes of\r\nAnglo-Saxon expansion was the realization in England of the need for\r\nprompt action in putting a limit to the growing domains of the King of\r\nSpain. In the century which had elapsed since Columbus opened a new\r\nworld to the peoples of Europe, this monarch had seized the richest part\r\nof the great prize, and was still reaching forward to the north and to\r\nthe south. Unless England took advantage of the present opportunity, the\r\nvast American continents might be closed to her forever. Anglo-Saxon\r\ncivilization in that case might well remain permanently cooped up in the\r\nlittle island that had seen its inception, while the Spanish language\r\nand Spanish institutions expanded to embrace the garden spots of the\r\nworld.[1-10]\r\n\r\nThere were still other motives for this great movement. The English felt\r\nthe prime necessity of discovering and controlling a new route to the\r\nEast, they wished to expand the influence of the Anglican church and\r\nconvert the Indians, they hoped to seize and fortify strategic points in\r\nAmerica which would aid them in their struggles with the Spaniards. But\r\nthese things, important as they were, paled beside the pressing\r\nnecessity of national expansion, of rehabilitating English industrial\r\nlife, restoring the merchant marine and securing economic independence.\r\n\r\nThus, when Captain Newport returned in 1607 to report that the colony of\r\nVirginia had been safely launched, many Englishmen were aroused to a\r\nhigh pitch of hope and expectation. Now at last a province had been\r\nsecured which could supply the raw materials which England so greatly\r\nneeded. The active supporters of the undertaking were lavish in their\r\npromises. Virginia would yield better and cheaper timber for shipping\r\nthan Prussia or Poland, she would furnish potash in abundance, and since\r\nwood could there be had for the cutting, her copper and iron ore could\r\nbe smelted on the spot. Wine could be made there, as excellent as that\r\nof the Canaries, they boasted, while it was hoped soon to manufacture\r\nsilk rivalling in fineness that of Persia or of Turkey. The waters of\r\nthe colony were full of \"Sturgion, Caviare and new land fish of the\r\nbest,\" her fields could produce hemp for cordage and flax for linen. As\r\nfor pitch, tar, turpentine and boards, there was a certainty of a rich\r\nreturn.[1-11] In February 1608, the Council of Virginia wrote to the\r\ncorporation of Plymouth: \"The staple and certain Comodities we have are\r\nSoap-ashes, pitch, tar, dyes of sundry sorts and rich values, timber for\r\nall uses, fishing for sturgeon and divers other sorts ... making of\r\nGlass and Iron, and no improbable hope of richer mines.\"[1-12]\r\n\r\nAnd no sooner had the infant colony been established than the Company\r\nturned with enthusiasm to the production of these highly desired\r\ncommodities. A number of foreigners, Dutchmen and Poles skilled in the\r\nmanufacture of ship-stores, were sent over to make a start with pitch,\r\ntar, turpentine and potash. They were to act as instructors, also, and\r\nit was expected that within a few years the Virginia forests would be\r\nfilled with workers in these trades. Unfortunately their efforts met\r\nwith ill success, and save for a few small samples of pitch and tar\r\nwhich were sent to England, nothing of value was produced.\r\n\r\nFor this failure the reason is apparent. All the able economists and\r\nstatesmen who had predicted that the colony would become an industrial\r\ncenter had overlooked one vitally important factor--the lack of cheap\r\nlabor. No matter how rich in natural resources, Virginia could not hope\r\nto compete with the long-established industries of Europe and Asia,\r\nbecause she lacked the abundant population requisite to success. It had\r\nbeen imagined by Hakluyt and others that the colony could avail herself\r\nof the surplus population of England, could drain off the upper stratum\r\nof the idle and unemployed. What more feasible than to set these men to\r\nwork in the forests of the New World to produce the raw materials the\r\nwant of which was responsible for unemployment in England itself!\r\n\r\nBut the voyage across the Atlantic was so long and costly, that it\r\nproved impossible to transport in any reasonable length of time enough\r\nworkers to Virginia to supply her needs. And the few thousand that came\r\nover in the early years of the Seventeenth century were in such great\r\ndemand that they could secure wages several times higher than those in\r\nvogue throughout Europe. Thus the London Company, from the very outset,\r\nfound itself face to face with a difficulty which it could never\r\nsurmount. Virginia could not compete with the ship-stores of the Baltic\r\nnations because her labor, when indeed it was found possible to secure\r\nlabor at all, was far more expensive than that of Poland or Sweden or\r\nRussia. It mattered not that the Company sent over indentured servants,\r\nbound by their contracts to work for a certain number of years; the\r\neffect was the same. The cost of transportation swallowed up the profits\r\nfrom the servant's labor, when that labor was expended upon industries\r\nwhich had to face the competition of the cheap workers of the Old World.\r\n\r\nIt speaks well for the acumen of Captain John Smith that he seems to\r\nhave been the first to grasp clearly this truth. He wrote that the\r\nworkingmen had made a beginning of \"Pitch and Tarre, Glass, Sope-ashes\r\nand Clapboard,\" but that little had been accomplished. \"If you rightly\r\nconsider what an infinite toyle it is in Russia and Swetland, where the\r\nwoods are proper for naught else, and though there be the helpe both of\r\nman and beast in those ancient Common-wealths, which many a hundred\r\nyears have used it, yet thousands of those poor people can scarce get\r\nnecessaries to live ... you must not expect from us any such\r\nmatter.\"[1-13]\r\n\r\nThe attempt to produce iron in Virginia was pursued even more\r\nvigorously, but with equally poor success. The early settlers, eager to\r\nassure the Company that the venture they had entered upon would soon\r\nyield a rich return, spoke enthusiastically of the numerous indications\r\nof the presence of iron ore. In 1609 Captain Newport brought with him to\r\nEngland a supply of ore from which sixteen or seventeen tons of metal\r\nwere extracted of a quality equal or superior to that obtained from any\r\nEuropean country. The iron was sold to the East India Company at the\r\nrate of £4 a ton.[1-14] Immediately plans were launched for taking\r\nadvantage of what seemed to be a splendid opportunity. In the course of\r\nthe first three years machinery for smelting and manufacturing iron was\r\nsent over and men were set to work to operate it. But the difficulties\r\nproved too great and ere long the attempt had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Company had no idea of relinquishing permanently its quest for\r\nstaple commodities, however, and soon a new and far more ambitious\r\nproject was set on foot for extracting the ore. The spot selected was at\r\nFalling Creek, in the present county of Chesterfield, a few miles below\r\nthe rapids of the James river. George Sandys had noted with satisfaction\r\nsome years before that the place was in every respect suited for iron\r\nsmelting, for in close proximity to the ore was wood in abundance,\r\nstones for the construction of the furnace and deep water for\r\ntransportation. To him it seemed that nature itself had selected the\r\nsite and endowed it with every facility which the enterprise could\r\nrequire.[1-15] Here the London Company spent from £4,000 to £5,000 in a\r\nsupreme effort to make their colony answer in some degree the\r\nexpectations which had been placed in it. A Captain Blewit, with no less\r\nthan 80 men, was sent over to construct the works, upon which, they\r\ndeclared, were fixed the eyes of \"God, Angels and men.\" But Blewit soon\r\nsuccumbed to one of the deadly epidemics which yearly swept over the\r\nlittle colony, and a Mr. John Berkeley, accompanied by 20 experienced\r\nworkers, came over to take his place.\r\n\r\nAt first things seem to have gone well with this ambitious venture. Soon\r\nthe Virginia forests were resounding to the whir of the axe and the\r\ncrash of falling trees, to the exclamations of scores of busy men as\r\nthey extracted the ore, built their furnace and began the work of\r\nsmelting. Operations had progressed so far that it was confidently\r\npredicted that soon large quantities of pig iron would be leaving the\r\nJames for England, when an unexpected disaster put an abrupt end to the\r\nenterprise. In the terrible massacre of 1622, when the implacable\r\nOpechancanough attempted at one stroke to rid the country of its white\r\ninvaders, the little industrial settlement at Falling Creek was\r\ncompletely destroyed. The furnace was ruined, the machinery thrown into\r\nthe river, the workmen butchered. This project, which had absorbed so\r\nmuch of the attention and resources of the Company, is said to have\r\nyielded only a shovel, a pair of tongs and one bar of iron.[1-16]\r\n\r\nThe history of the attempts to establish glass works in Virginia is also\r\na story of wasted energy and money, of final failure. The Dutch and\r\nPolish workers who came in 1608 set up a furnace at Jamestown,[1-17] but\r\nnothing more is heard of them, and it is clear that they met with no\r\nsuccess. Nor did Captain William Norton, who arrived in 1621 with a\r\nnumber of skilled Italian glass workers fare any better.[1-18] In 1623\r\nGeorge Sandys wrote: \"Capt. Norton dyed with all save one of his\r\nservants, the Italians fell extremely sick yet recovered; but I conceave\r\nthey would gladly make the work to appear unfeasable, that they might by\r\nthat means be dismissed for England. The fier hath now been for six\r\nweeks in ye furnace and yet nothing effected. They claim that the sand\r\nwill not run.\" Shortly after this the workmen brought matters to an end\r\nby cracking the furnace with a crowbar.[1-19]\r\n\r\nThus ended in complete failure the efforts of England to reap what she\r\nconsidered the legitimate fruits of this great enterprise. The day of\r\nwhich her farseeing publicists had dreamed had arrived; she had at last\r\nchallenged the right of Spain to all North America, her sons were\r\nactually settled on the banks of the James, a beginning had been made in\r\nthe work of building a colonial empire. But the hope which had so fired\r\nthe mind of Hakluyt, the hope of attaining through Virginia British\r\neconomic independence, was destined never to be fulfilled. However\r\nlavishly nature had endowed the colony with natural resources, however\r\ndense her forests, however rich her mines, however wide and deep her\r\nwaterways, she could not become an industrial community. Fate had\r\ndecreed for her another destiny. But England was reluctant to accept the\r\ninevitable in this matter. Long years after Sir Edwin Sandys and his\r\nfellow workers of the London Company had passed to their rest, we find\r\nthe royal ministers urging upon the colony the necessity of producing\r\npig iron and silk and potash, and promising every possible encouragement\r\nin the work. But the causes which operated to bring failure in 1610 or\r\n1620 prevented success in 1660 and 1680. Virginia had not the abundant\r\nsupply of labor essential to the development of an industrial community\r\nand for many decades, perhaps for centuries, could not hope to attain\r\nit. Her future lay in the discovery and exploitation of one staple\r\ncommodity for which she was so preëminently adapted that she could, even\r\nwith her costly labor, meet the competition of other lands. The future\r\nhistory of Virginia was to be built up around the Indian plant tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER II_\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN WEED\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory is baffling in its complexity. The human mind instinctively\r\nstrives for simplicity, endeavors to reproduce all things to set rules,\r\nto discover the basic principles upon which all action is based. And in\r\nvarious lines of research much success has attended these efforts. We\r\nknow the laws underlying the movements of the planets, of various\r\nchemical reactions, of plant and animal life. It is inevitable, then,\r\nthat attempts should be made to accomplish similar results in history,\r\nto master the vast multitude of facts which crowd its pages, many of\r\nthem seemingly unrelated, and show that after all they obey certain\r\nfundamental laws. Despite the vaunted freedom of the human will, it is\r\nmaintained, mankind like the planets or the chemical agents, cannot\r\nescape the operation of definite forces to which it is subjected. And if\r\nthese forces are studied and understood, to some extent at least, the\r\ncourse of future events may be predicted.\r\n\r\nThus it may be accepted as practically established that in any country\r\nand with any people a condition of continued disorder and anarchy must\r\nbe succeeded by one of despotism. History records, we believe, no\r\nexception to this rule, while there are many instances which tend to\r\nconfirm it. The absolute rule of the Caesars followed the anarchy of the\r\nlater Roman republic, the Oliverian Protectorate succeeded the British\r\ncivil wars, the first French Empire the Reign of Terror, the Bolshevik\r\ndespotism the collapse of the old regime in Russia. Such will always be\r\nthe case, we are told, because mankind turns instinctively to any form\r\nof government in quest of protection from anarchy, and the easiest form\r\nof government to establish and operate is despotism.\r\n\r\nNot content with generalizations of this kind, however, certain\r\nhistorians have undertaken to reduce all human action to some one great\r\nfundamental principle. The Freudian view emphasizes the influence of\r\nsex; Buckle maintains that the effect of climate is all-powerful. In\r\nrecent years many students, while not agreeing that the solution of the\r\nproblem is quite so simple, yet believe that underlying all social\r\ndevelopment will be found economic forces of one kind or another, that\r\nin commerce and industry and agriculture lies the key to every event of\r\nmoment in the history of mankind. Often these forces have been obscured\r\nand misunderstood, but close study will always reveal them. It is folly\r\nto waste time, they say, as writers have so long done, in setting forth\r\nthe adventures of this great man or that, in dwelling upon the details\r\nof political struggles or recounting the horrors of war. All these are\r\nbut surface indications of the deeper movements underneath, movements in\r\nevery case brought about by economic developments.\r\n\r\nBut this interpretation of history is by no means universally accepted.\r\nWhile admitting readily that the conditions surrounding the production\r\nand exchange of useful commodities have affected profoundly the course\r\nof events, many historians deny that they give the key to every\r\nimportant movement. We must study also the progress of human thought, of\r\nreligion, of politics, or our conception of history will be warped and\r\nimperfect. How is it possible to explain the French religious wars of\r\nthe Sixteenth century by the theory of economic causes? In what way does\r\nit account for the rebellion of Virginia and North Carolina and Maryland\r\nagainst the British government in 1775? How can one deny that the\r\nassassination of Abraham Lincoln affected profoundly the course of\r\nAmerican history?\r\n\r\nThese efforts to simplify the meaning of human events have often led to\r\nerror, have stressed certain events too strongly, have minimized others.\r\nThe complexity of history is self-evident; we must for the present at\r\nleast content ourselves with complex interpretations of it. If there be\r\nany great underlying principles which explain all, they have yet to be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThus it would be folly in the study of colonial Virginia to blind\r\nourselves to the importance of various non-economic factors, the love of\r\nfreedom which the settlers brought with them from England, their\r\naffection for the mother country, the influence of the Anglican church.\r\nYet it is obvious that we cannot understand the colony, its social\r\nstructure, its history, its development unless we have a clear insight\r\ninto the economic forces which operated upon it. These Englishmen,\r\nfinding themselves in a new country, surrounded by conditions\r\nfundamentally different from those to which they had been accustomed,\r\nworked out a new and unique society, were themselves moulded into\r\nsomething different.\r\n\r\nAnd in colonial Virginia history there is a key, which though it may not\r\nexplain all, opens the door to much that is fundamental. This key is\r\ntobacco. The old saying that the story of Virginia is but the story of\r\ntobacco is by no means a gross exaggeration. It was this Indian plant,\r\nso despised by many of the best and ablest men of the time, which\r\ndetermined the character of the life of the colony and shaped its\r\ndestinies for two and a half centuries. Tobacco was the chief factor in\r\nbringing final and complete failure to the attempts to produce useful\r\nraw materials, it was largely instrumental in moulding the social\r\nclasses and the political structure of the colony, it was almost\r\nentirely responsible for the system of labor, it even exerted a powerful\r\ninfluence upon religion and morals. In a word, one can understand almost\r\nnothing of Virginia, its infancy, its development, its days of\r\nmisfortune, its era of prosperity, its peculiar civilization, the nature\r\nof its relations to England, unless one knows the history of tobacco.\r\n\r\nAs though they had a prophetic vision of its future importance, the\r\nVirginia Indians revered the plant. To them it was an especial gift\r\ndirect from the Great Spirit, and as such was endowed with unusual\r\nproperties for doing good. When the fields of maize were dried and\r\nparched for lack of rain they powdered the tobacco and cast it to the\r\nwinds that the evil genii might be propitiated; their priests on great\r\noccasions fed it to the sacrificial fires; when the usual catch of fish\r\nfailed it was scattered over the water.[2-1] Smoking was considered a\r\ntoken of friendship and peace. When the white men first visited the\r\nnative villages they soon found that to reject the proffered pipe was to\r\noffend their savage hosts and incur their hostility.\r\n\r\nIt was John Rolfe, celebrated as the husband of Pocahontas, who first\r\nexperimented with the native leaf. This gentleman was himself fond of\r\nsmoking, but he found the Virginia tobacco as it came from the hands of\r\nthe savages, decidedly inferior to that of the West Indies. The leaf\r\nitself was small, and although the flavor was weak it was biting to the\r\ntongue.[2-2] Rolfe's efforts proved entirely successful. In 1614, two\r\nyears after his first attempt, he had obtained a product which Ralph\r\nHamor declared to be as \"strong, sweet and pleasant as any under the\r\nsun.\"[2-3]\r\n\r\nThus, early in its history, Virginia had found a commodity for which she\r\nwas preëminently suited, in the production of which she could compete\r\nsuccessfully with any country in the world. And for her tobacco she had\r\na ready market. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth the habit of smoking\r\nhad spread rapidly among the upper classes of English, until at the end\r\nof the sixteenth century, it was almost universal. When James I\r\nascended the throne, although feeling a strong aversion to tobacco, he\r\nwas forced to take up its use in order not to appear conspicuous among\r\nhis courtiers, for the dictates of custom seem to have been as strong\r\nthree hundred years ago as at present.[2-4] At the time that Rolfe was\r\nmaking his experiments England was spending yearly for the Spanish\r\nproduct many thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the colonists turned eagerly to tobacco\r\nculture. The news that Rolfe's little crop had been pronounced in\r\nEngland to be of excellent quality spread rapidly from settlement to\r\nsettlement, bringing with it new hope and determination. Immediately\r\ntobacco absorbed the thoughts of all, became the one topic of\r\nconversation, and every available patch of land was seized upon for its\r\ncultivation. The fortified areas within the palisades were crowded with\r\ntobacco plants, while even the streets of Jamestown were utilized by the\r\neager planters.[2-5] In 1617 the George set sail for England laden with\r\n20,000 pounds of Virginia leaf, the first of the vast fleet of tobacco\r\nships which for centuries were to pass through the capes of the\r\nChesapeake bound for Europe.[2-6] By 1627, the tobacco exports amounted\r\nto no less than half a million pounds.[2-7]\r\n\r\nThe London Company, together with the host of patriotic Englishmen who\r\nhad placed such great hopes in the colony, were much disappointed at\r\nthis unexpected turn of events. They had sought in the New World those\r\n\"solid commodities\" which they realized were fundamental to the\r\nprosperity of their country, commodities upon which English industrial\r\nlife was founded. And they had found only the Indian weed--tobacco. This\r\nplant not only contributed nothing to the wealth of the kingdom, it was\r\nfelt, but was positively injurious to those who indulged in its use.\r\nSurely, declared one writer, men \"grow mad and crazed in the brain in\r\nthat they would adventure to suck the smoke of a weed.\" James I thought\r\nthere could be no baser and more harmful corruption, while Charles I\r\nexpressed himself with equal emphasis. So late as 1631 the latter\r\nprotested against the growing use of tobacco, which he termed \"an evil\r\nhabit of late tymes.\"[2-8]\r\n\r\nYet England soon learned to welcome the colonial tobacco as far better\r\nthan no product at all. Hitherto the leaf in use had been raised in the\r\nSpanish colonies, and England's annual tobacco bill was becoming larger\r\nand larger. It seemed calamitous that British industry should be drained\r\nof good and useful commodities in exchange for a plant the consumption\r\nof which was harmful rather than beneficial. It was at least some\r\nsatisfaction to know, then, that England could substitute for the\r\nSpanish leaf the growth of their own colonies. Apparently it was only\r\nlater, however, that there came a full realization of the opportunity\r\nafforded for enriching England and building up her merchant marine by\r\nexporting tobacco to foreign countries. For the present they accepted\r\nthis one product of their experiment in colonial expansion, reluctantly\r\nand with keen disappointment, as the best that could be obtained.\r\n\r\nYet it was obvious to the London Company that tobacco held out the only\r\nprospect, not only of securing a profit from their venture, but of\r\nbringing to Virginia some measure of prosperity. The first consignment\r\nof leaf which came from the colony sold for no less than 5s. 3d. a\r\npound, a price which promised a rich return to the planters on the James\r\nand their backers in England.[2-9] And they much preferred to have a\r\nprosperous colony, even when prosperity was founded on tobacco, than a\r\nweak, impoverished settlement, which would be a drain upon their\r\npersonal resources and of no value to the nation. Thus they accepted the\r\ninevitable, gave what encouragement they could to the new product, and\r\nsought to use it as a means for building up the British empire in\r\nAmerica. When once England had established herself firmly in the New\r\nWorld, it would be time enough to return to the attempt to secure from\r\nthe colony ship-stores, potash, iron and silk.\r\n\r\nWith the overthrow of the Company, however, the Crown made repeated\r\nefforts to direct the energies of Virginia away from the all-absorbing\r\ncultivation of tobacco. In 1636 Charles I wrote to the Governor and\r\nCouncil bidding them moderate the excessive quantities of the plant laid\r\nout each year and to endeavor to produce some other staple\r\ncommodities.[2-10] \"The King cannot but take notice,\" he reiterated the\r\nnext year, \"how little that colony hath advanced in Staple commodities\r\nfit for their own subsistence and clothing,\" and he warned the planters\r\nto emulate the Barbados and Caribee Islands, where a beginning had been\r\nmade in cotton, wool and other useful things.[2-11] But the colonists\r\npaid no heed to these repeated warnings. The King's commands were no\r\nmore effective in establishing new industries than had been the first\r\nattempts of the Company. Virginia was not prepared to compete with the\r\nworkers of Europe in their own chosen fields, and persisted, had to\r\npersist, in the production of the one commodity for which she possessed\r\nunsurpassed natural advantages.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how universally the plant was cultivated by all classes\r\nof Virginians throughout the colonial period. It was difficult to find\r\nskilled artisans in any line of work, since those who had pursued in\r\nEngland the various trades usually deserted them, when they landed in\r\nthe colony, in order to turn to the raising of tobacco. And the few who\r\ncontinued to pursue their old vocations usually rented or purchased a\r\nsmall tract of land and devoted a part of their time to its cultivation.\r\nBlacksmiths, carpenters, shipwrights, coopers all raised their little\r\ntobacco crop and sold it to the British merchants,[2-12] while even the\r\npoor minister sought to make ends meet by planting his glebe with\r\nOrinoco or Sweetscented. The Governor himself was not free from the\r\nall-prevailing custom, and frequently was the possessor of a farm where\r\nhis servants and slaves, like those of other gentlemen in the colony,\r\nwere kept busy tending the tobacco crop.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the members of the London Company, even Sir Edwin\r\nSandys himself, ever attempted to visualize the social structure which\r\nwould develop in the Virginia they were planning. If so, they\r\nunquestionably pictured a state of affairs very different from that\r\nwhich the future held in store. They took it for granted that Virginia\r\nwould to a large extent be a duplicate of England. In the forests of the\r\nNew World would grow up towns and villages, centers of industry and\r\ncenters of trade. The population would be divided into various\r\nclasses--well-to-do proprietors boasting of the title of gentleman;\r\nprofessional men, lawyers, physicians, ministers; skilled artisans of\r\nall kinds; day laborers.\r\n\r\nWe catch a glimpse of the Virginia of their minds from a Broadside\r\nissued in 1610, appealing for volunteers for service in the\r\ncolony.[2-13] We can see the shipwrights at work in the busy yards of\r\nthriving ports; the smelters caring for their iron and copper furnaces;\r\nthe \"minerall-men\" digging out the ore; saltmakers evaporating the\r\nbrackish waters for their useful product; vine-dressers tending their\r\nabundant crops of grapes and coopers turning out the hogsheads in which\r\nto store the wine which came from the presses; bricklayers and\r\ncarpenters fashioning substantial houses; fishermen bringing in the\r\nplentiful yield of the day and dressers preparing the fish for foreign\r\nshipment; joiners, smiths, gardeners, bakers, gun-founders,\r\nploughwrights, brewers, sawyers, fowlers, each plying his trade in the\r\nNew Brittania.\r\n\r\nBut how different was the reality. Virginia became, not an industrial,\r\nbut a distinctly agricultural community. For more than a century it\r\ncould boast not a single town worthy of the name.[2-14] It was but a\r\nseries of plantations, not large in extent, but stretching out for miles\r\nalong the banks of the rivers and creeks, all devoted to the raising of\r\ntobacco. The population of the colony was but the aggregate of the\r\npopulation of the plantation--the owner, the wage earners, the\r\nindentured servant, a few slaves. Virginia in the Seventeenth century,\r\ndespite the design of its founders, developed a life of its own, a life\r\nnot only unlike that of England, but unique and distinct.\r\n\r\nImmigration, like everything else in the colony, was shaped by the needs\r\nof tobacco. For its successful production the plant does not require\r\nskilled labor or intensive cultivation. The barbarous natives of Africa,\r\nwho later in the century were imported in such large numbers, eventually\r\nproved quite adequate to the task. But it does require the service of\r\nmany hands. For decades after Rolfe's discovery had opened a new vista\r\nof prosperity for Virginia, fertile land was so cheap that a person even\r\nof moderate means might readily purchase an extensive plantation,[2-15]\r\nbut it would be of little service to him unless he could find hands for\r\nclearing away the forests, breaking the soil, tending and curing the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nOf the three requirements of production--natural resources, capital and\r\nlabor--the fertile soil furnished the first in abundance, the second\r\ncould readily be secured, but the last remained for a full century the\r\none great problem of the planters. From the days of Sir George Yeardley\r\nto those of Nicholson and Andros there was a persistent and eager demand\r\nfor workers. Of this there can be no better evidence than the remarkably\r\nhigh wages which prevailed in the colony, especially in the years prior\r\nto the Restoration. In fact, it is probable that the laborer received\r\nfor his services four or five times the amount he could earn in\r\nEngland. Even during the time of the London Company we find George\r\nSandys writing to a friend in London to procure indentured servants for\r\nthe colony as the wages demanded were intolerable. A day's work brought,\r\nin addition to food, a pound of tobacco valued at one shilling, while in\r\nEngland the unskilled worker considered himself fortunate if he could\r\nearn so much in a week.[2-16]\r\n\r\nIn his efforts to solve this acute problem the planter found little hope\r\nin the aborigines. The Spaniards, it is true, had made use of the\r\nIndians to till their fields or work in the gold and silver mines, but\r\nthe Pamunkey and the Powhatan were cast in a different mold from the\r\nAztec and the Peruvian. To hunt them out of their native lairs and bind\r\nthem to arduous and ignominious servitude was hardly to be thought of.\r\nTheir spirit was too proud to be thus broken, the safe refuge of the\r\nwoods too near at hand. One might as well have attempted to hitch lions\r\nand tigers to the plough shaft, as to place these wild children of the\r\nforest at the handles. At times it proved practicable to make use of\r\nIndian children for servants, and there are numerous instances on record\r\nin which they are found in the homes of the planters.[2-17] But this, of\r\ncourse, could be of little service in solving the pressing labor\r\nproblem, in clearing new ground or tilling the idle fields. The Virginia\r\nlandowner was forced to turn elsewhere for his helpers.\r\n\r\nIn 1619 a Dutch privateer put into the James river and disembarked\r\ntwenty Africans who were sold to the settlers as slaves. This event, so\r\nfull of evil portent for the future of Virginia, might well have\r\nafforded a natural and satisfactory solution of the labor problem.\r\nSlaves had long been used in the Spanish colonies, proving quite\r\ncompetent to do the work of tending the tobacco plants, and bringing\r\nhandsome returns to their masters. But it was impossible at this time\r\nfor England to supply her plantations with this type of labor. The\r\nslave trade was in the hands of the Dutch, who had fortified themselves\r\non the African coast and jealously excluded other nations. Thus while\r\nthe demand for negro slaves remained active in the colony, they\r\nincreased in numbers very slowly. The muster of 1624-25 shows only\r\n22.[2-18] During the following half century there was a small influx of\r\nnegroes, but their numbers were still too small to affect seriously the\r\neconomic life of the colony.[2-19]\r\n\r\nThe settlers were thus forced to look to England itself to supply them\r\nwith hands for their tobacco fields. They knew that in the mother\r\ncountry were many thousands of indigent persons who would welcome an\r\nopportunity to better their lot by migrating to the New World. And the\r\nEnglish statesmen, feeling that there was need for blood letting,\r\nwelcomed an opportunity to divert the surplus population to the new\r\ncolony in America.[2-20] The decline in English foreign trade and the\r\nstagnation of home industry had brought unemployment and suffering to\r\nevery class of workers. Wages were so low that the most industrious\r\ncould not maintain themselves in comfort, while to provide against want\r\nin case of sickness or old age was hardly to be thought of. Every\r\nparish, every town swarmed with persons stricken with abject poverty. In\r\nsome parts of the country no less than 30 per cent of the population\r\nwere dependent in part upon charity for their daily bread, while many\r\nwere driven into vagabondage and crime, becoming an element of danger\r\nrather than of strength to the nation.[2-21] It seemed to the planters\r\nthat the mother country constituted an abundant reservoir of labor, a\r\nreservoir already overflowing and capable of supplying indefinitely\r\ntheir every need.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback was the long and expensive voyage across the Atlantic.\r\nThe fare, even for the poorest and most crowded accommodations, was no\r\nless than six pounds sterling, a sum far beyond the means of the\r\nthriftiest laborer.[2-22] Obviously some scheme had to be evolved to\r\novercome this difficulty before Virginia could make use of English\r\nlabor. And so the planters turned to the simple expedient of advancing\r\nthe passage money to the immigrant and of placing him under strict legal\r\nbonds to work it out after reaching the colony.\r\n\r\nThis system, around which the economic life of Virginia centered for a\r\nfull century, proved satisfactory to all concerned. The credit advanced\r\nto the immigrant made it possible for him to earn his ocean fare, not in\r\nEngland where labor was cheap, but in America where it was dear. In\r\nother words, he was enabled without delay to enjoy the full benefits of\r\nselling his services in the best market. The necessity for placing him\r\nunder a stringent contract or indenture is evident. Had this not been\r\ndone the immigrant, upon finding himself in Virginia, might have refused\r\nto carry out his part of the bargain. But the indenture was in no sense\r\na mark of servitude or slavery. It simply made it obligatory for the\r\nnewcomer, under pain of severe penalties, to work out his passage money,\r\nand until that was accomplished to surrender a part of the personal\r\nliberty so dear to every Englishman.\r\n\r\nIt is erroneous to suppose that most of the servants were degenerates or\r\ncriminals. It is true that the English Government from time to time\r\nsought to lessen the expense of providing for convicted felons by\r\nsending some of them to the colonies, among them on rare occasions a few\r\ndecidedly objectionable characters. More than once the Virginians\r\nprotested vigorously against this policy as dangerous to the peace and\r\nprosperity of the colony.[2-23] By far the larger part of these penal\r\nimmigrants, however, were but harmless paupers, driven perhaps to theft\r\nor some other petty offense by cold and hunger. Often they were\r\nsentenced to deportation by merciful judges in order that they might\r\nnot feel the full weight of the harsh laws of that day.[2-24]\r\n\r\nAnd of the small number of real criminals who came in, few indeed made\r\nany lasting imprint upon the social fabric of the colony. Many served\r\nfor life and so had no opportunity of marrying and rearing families to\r\nperpetuate their degenerate traits. Those who escaped fled from the\r\nconfines of settled Virginia to the mountains or to the backwoods of\r\nNorth Carolina. Many others succumbed to the epidemics which proved so\r\ndeadly to the newcomers from England. In fact the criminal servant was\r\nbut a passing incident in the life and development of England's greatest\r\nand most promising colony.[2-25]\r\n\r\nAn appreciable proportion of the so-called criminal laborers were no\r\nmore than political prisoners taken in the rebellions of the Seventeenth\r\ncentury. These men frequently represented the sturdiest and most\r\npatriotic elements in the kingdom and were a source of strength rather\r\nthan of weakness to the colony. When Drogheda was captured by Cromwell's\r\nstern Puritan troops in 1649, some of the unfortunate rebels escaped the\r\nfiring squad only to be sent to America to serve in the sugar or tobacco\r\nfields. Just how many of these Irishmen fell to the share of Virginia it\r\nis impossible to say, but the number rises well into the hundreds, and\r\nthe patent books of the period are full of headrights of undoubted Irish\r\norigin.[2-26]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 it became the turn of\r\nthe Puritans to suffer, and many non-conformists and former Oliverian\r\nsoldiers were sent to Virginia. In fact so many old Commonwealth men\r\nwere serving in the tobacco fields in 1663 that they felt strong enough\r\nto plot, not only for their own freedom, but for the overthrow of the\r\ncolonial government.[2-27] In 1678, after the suppression of the\r\nScottish Covenanters by the Highland Host, a new batch of prisoners were\r\nsent to the plantations.[2-28] Seven years later many of Monmouth's\r\nfollowers taken at Sedgemour, who were fortunate enough to escape the\r\nfury of Jeffreys and Kirk, were forced to work in the plantations.\r\n\r\nBut the bulk of the servants were neither criminals nor political\r\nprisoners, but poor persons seeking to better their condition in the\r\nland of promise across the Atlantic. They constituted the vanguard of\r\nthat vast stream of immigrants which for three centuries Europe has\r\npoured upon our shores. The indentured servant differed in no essential\r\nfrom the poor Ulsterite or German who followed him in the Eighteenth\r\ncentury, or the Irishman, the Italian or the Slav in the Nineteenth.\r\nLike them he found too severe the struggle for existence at home, like\r\nthem he sought to reach a land where labor, the only commodity he had to\r\nsell, would bring the highest return. The fact that his passage was paid\r\nfor him and that he was bound by contract to work it out after reaching\r\nAmerica, in no wise differentiates him from the newcomers of later days.\r\nIn 1671 Sir William Berkeley reported to the Board of Trade that the\r\ncolony contained \"6,000 Christian servants for a short tyme,\" who had\r\ncome with the \"hope of bettering their condition in a Growing\r\nCountry.\"[2-29]\r\n\r\nVirginia is fortunate in having preserved a record of this, the first\r\ngreat migration to the English colonies, which in some respects is\r\nremarkably complete. In fact, the names of fully three-fourths of all\r\nthe persons who came to the colony, whether as freemen or servants\r\nduring the first century of its existence, are on record at the Land\r\nOffice at Richmond, and at all times available to the student of\r\nhistory. In the early days of the settlement a law was passed designed\r\nto stimulate immigration, by which the Government pledged itself to\r\ngrant fifty acres of land to any person who would pay the passage from\r\nEurope to Virginia of a new settler. Thus if one brought over ten\r\nindentured servants he would be entitled to 500 acres of land, if he\r\nbrought 100, he could demand 5,000 acres. But the headright, as it was\r\ncalled, was not restricted to servants; if one came over as a freeman,\r\npaying his own passage, he was entitled to the fifty acres. Should he\r\nbring also his family, he could demand an additional fifty acres for his\r\nwife and fifty for each child or other member of the household.[2-30]\r\n\r\nWhen the Government issued a grant for land under this law, the planter\r\nwas required to record with the clerk of the county court the names of\r\nall persons for whose transportation the claim was made. Some of these\r\nlists have been lost, especially for the period from 1655 to 1666, but\r\nmost of them remain, constituting an inexhaustible storehouse of\r\ninformation concerning the colony and the people who came to its\r\nshores.[2-31] How the papers escaped destruction during the fire which\r\ndid so much damage in the Secretary's office at the time of Andros, it\r\nis impossible to say. The explanation is to be found perhaps in the fact\r\nthat copies of the records were kept, not only at Williamsburg, but in\r\nthe several counties, so that in case of loss by fire new entries could\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nImmigration to Virginia continued in unabated volume throughout the\r\nSeventeenth century. The needs of the tobacco plantations were\r\nunceasing, and year after year the surplus population of England poured\r\nacross the Atlantic in response. An examination of the list of\r\nheadrights shows that the annual influx was between 1500 and 2000. Even\r\nduring the Civil War and Commonwealth periods this average seems to have\r\nbeen maintained with surprising consistency. Apparently the only limit\r\nwhich could be set upon it was the available space on board the merchant\r\nfleet which each year left England for the Chesapeake bay. Thus in the\r\nyear ending May 1635 we find that 2000 landed in the colony,[2-32] while\r\nin 1674 and again in 1682 the same average was maintained.[2-33] At\r\ntimes the numbers dropped to 1200 or 1300, but this was the exception\r\nrather than the rule. All in all, considerably more than 100,000 persons\r\nmigrated to the colony in the years that elapsed between the first\r\nsettlement at Jamestown and the end of the century.[2-34]\r\n\r\nThis great movement, which far surpassed in magnitude any other English\r\nmigration of the century, fixed for all time the character of the white\r\npopulation of tidewater Virginia. The vast bulk of the settlers were\r\nEnglish. An examination of the headright lists shows here and there an\r\nIrish or a Scotch name, and on very rare occasions one of French or\r\nItalian origin, but in normal periods fully 95 per cent were\r\nunmistakably Anglo-Saxon. In fact, such names as Dixon, Bennett,\r\nAnderson, Adams, Greene, Brooke, Brown, Cooper, Gibson, Hall, Harris,\r\nKing, Jackson, Long, Martin, Miller, Newton, Philips, Richards, Turner,\r\nWhite, appear with monotonous repetition. Except in the years 1655 and\r\n1656, after the Drogheda tragedy when one sees such names as O'Lanny,\r\nO'Leaby, O'Mally, and Machoone, or in 1679 when there was a sprinkling\r\nof Scottish names, the entire list is distinctly English.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that immigration to Virginia in the Seventeenth\r\ncentury was restricted to indentured servants. Some of the settlers were\r\nfreemen, paying their own passage and establishing themselves as\r\nproprietors immediately after arriving in the colony. But the conditions\r\nwhich attracted them were the same as those which brought over the\r\nservants. In both cases it was tobacco, the rich returns which it\r\npromised and the urgent need it had of labor, which impelled them to\r\nleave their homes in England to seek their fortunes in the strange land\r\nbeyond the seas.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the character of the immigration to Virginia, it remains to\r\ndetermine what was the fate of the settler after he reached the colony,\r\nwhat rôle lay before him in its social and economic life. Would he\r\nremain permanently in the status of a servant, entering into a new\r\nagreement with his master after the expiration of the old? Would he\r\neventually become a day laborer, working for wages upon the estates of\r\nthe wealthy? Would he become a tenant? Could he hope to become a\r\nfreeholder, making of Virginia, like Rome in the early days of the\r\nrepublic, the land of the small proprietor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER III_\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGINIA YEOMANRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of indentured labor differed vitally from negro slavery. The\r\nservant usually was bound to his master for a limited period only, and\r\nat the expiration of four or five years was a free man, to go where he\r\nwould and pursue what employment seemed most lucrative. And of\r\ntremendous importance to the future of Virginia was the fact that he was\r\nof the same race and blood as the rest of the population. There was no\r\ninherent reason why he might not take up land, marry and become a part\r\nof the social structure of the colony.\r\n\r\nWhen races of marked physical differences are placed side by side in the\r\nsame territory, assimilation of one or the other becomes difficult, and\r\nan age long repugnance and conflict is apt to result. Perhaps the\r\ngreatest crime against the southern colonies was not the introduction of\r\nslavery, but the introduction of negroes. It was inevitable that\r\neventually slavery would be abolished. But the negro race in America\r\ncannot be abolished, it cannot be shipped back to Africa, it cannot well\r\nbe absorbed into the white population. Today California is struggling to\r\navoid a like problem by excluding the Japanese, while Canada, Australia\r\nand New Zealand are closing their doors to Orientals of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThus Virginia, during its century of white immigration, was storing up\r\nno perplexing difficulties for the future, was developing slowly but\r\nsurely into an industrious, democratic, Anglo-Saxon community. Not until\r\nthe black flood of slaves was turned loose upon her, strangling her\r\npeasantry and revolutionizing her industrial and social life, was her\r\nfuture put in pawn. The white servants, so far as they remained in the\r\ncolony, became bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh, promised her a\r\nhomogeneous race, a sound economic and political development.\r\n\r\nWhen the alien newcomer to the United States sees from the deck of his\r\nsteamer the Statue of Liberty and the ragged sky line of lower\r\nManhattan, he feels that the goal of his ambition has been reached, that\r\nthe land of opportunity lies before him. But to the indentured settler\r\nof the Seventeenth century, his arrival in the James or the York was but\r\nthe beginning of his struggles. Before he could grasp the riches of the\r\nNew World, he must pay the price of his passage, must work out through\r\narduous years the indenture to which he had affixed his signature.\r\n\r\nAnd these years were filled not only with toil, perhaps with hardship,\r\nbut with the greatest peril. He might account himself fortunate indeed\r\nif during the first twelve months he escaped the so-called Virginia\r\nsickness. Tidewater Virginia for the English settlers was a pest-ridden\r\nplace. The low and marshy ground, the swarming mosquitoes, the hot sun,\r\nthe unwholesome drinking water combined to produce an unending epidemic\r\nof dysentery and malaria. And at frequent intervals, especially in the\r\nearly years, yellow fever, scurvy and plague swept over the infant\r\ncolony, leaving behind a ghastly train of suffering and death.[3-1] At\r\none time the mortality among the settlers upon the James ran as high as\r\n75 per cent and for a while it seemed that this attempt of the British\r\nnation to secure a foothold upon the American continent must end in\r\nfailure.[3-2]\r\n\r\nBut as the years wore on better conditions prevailed. Governor Berkeley\r\ntestified in 1671, \"there is not oft seasoned hands (as we term them)\r\nthat die now, whereas heretofore not one of five escaped the first\r\nyear.\"[3-3] This improvement was brought about by the use of Peruvian\r\nbark, a clearer understanding of sanitary matters and the selection of\r\nmore healthful sites for plantations. At the time when Sir William wrote\r\nit is probable that 80 per cent or more of the indentured servants\r\nsurvived the dangers of the tobacco fields, completed their terms of\r\nservice and, if they remained in the colony, became freedmen with the\r\nfull rights of Englishmen and Virginians.\r\n\r\nIn the period from 1660 to 1725 there was, as we shall see, an exodus of\r\npoor whites from Virginia. This, however, was chiefly the result of the\r\ninflux of slaves which marked the end of the century, and it is safe to\r\nassume that prior to the Restoration there was no extensive movement\r\nfrom Virginia to other colonies. The servant, upon attaining his\r\nfreedom, usually remained in the colony and sought to establish himself\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible to determine accurately the average length of\r\nservice required by the indentures, there is reason to believe that it\r\ndid not exceed five years. In cases of controversy between masters and\r\nservants who had come in without written contracts as to when their\r\nterms should expire, it was at first required by law that the period be\r\nfixed at five years if the age was in excess of twenty-one.[3-4] In\r\n1654, however, a new act was passed by the Assembly, making it necessary\r\nfor those who had no indentures, if over sixteen to serve six years, if\r\nless than sixteen until the twenty-fourth year had been reached.[3-5]\r\nThis was found to work to the disadvantage of the colony by discouraging\r\nimmigration, and in 1662 the law was changed so that in all doubtful\r\ncases the legal term should be five years for persons over sixteen.[3-6]\r\nSince the Assembly, which was so largely made up of persons who\r\nthemselves held servants, would certainly not fix the legal term for a\r\nperiod shorter than that normally provided for in the indentures, we\r\nmay assume that usually the servant secured his freedom within four or\r\nfive years after his arrival in the colony.\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that the bulk of the population could not have been,\r\nas is so often supposed, made up of large landed proprietors with their\r\nservants and slaves. Such a conception takes no account of the annual\r\ntranslation of hundreds of men and women from bondsmen into freedmen.\r\nThe short duration of the average term of service, together with the\r\nfact that the servants were usually still young when freed, made it\r\ninevitable that in time the freedmen would outnumber those in service.\r\nThe size of the annual immigration could in no wise alter this\r\nsituation, for the greater the influx of servants, the greater would be\r\nthe resulting graduation into the class of freedmen.\r\n\r\nThe average number of headrights, as we have seen, was probably not less\r\nthan 1750 a year. If it is assumed that 1500 of these were servants,\r\nfive per cent of whom served for life and 20 per cent died before the\r\nexpiration of their terms, no less than 1125 would remain to become\r\nfreedmen. While the number of those under indenture remained practically\r\nstationary, the size of the freedman class grew larger with the passing\r\nof the years.\r\n\r\nPlacing the average term at five years, then, and the average mortality\r\nat twenty per cent, there would be in service at any given time some\r\n6,000 men and women. In fact, Sir William Berkeley, in his famous report\r\nof 1671, estimated the number of servants in the colony at this\r\nfigure.[3-7] On the other hand an annual accession of 1125 to the class\r\nof freedmen would in five years amount to 5,625, in ten years to 11,250,\r\nin fifteen to 16,875, in twenty to 22,500. At the end of half a century\r\nno less than 56,250 persons would have emerged from servitude to become\r\nfree citizens. Although there is every reason to believe that these\r\nfigures are substantially correct,[3-8] their accuracy or lack of\r\naccuracy in no way affect the principle involved. From its very nature\r\nit was impossible that the system of indentured servants should long\r\nremain the chief factor in the industrial life of the colony or supply\r\nmost of the labor.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that the number of those completing their terms\r\nof indenture is not an absolute gauge, at any given date, of the size of\r\nthe freedman class. To determine this it would be necessary to know the\r\naverage span of life of the freedman, a thing certainly not worked out\r\nat the time and impossible of accomplishment now. We may assume,\r\nhowever, that it was relatively long. The newcomer who had lived through\r\nthe first terrible year in the tobacco fields had been thoroughly\r\ntested, \"seasoned\" as the planters called it, and was reasonably certain\r\nof reaching a mature age. Moreover, the servants were almost universally\r\nof very tender years. Seldom indeed would a dealer accept one over\r\ntwenty-eight, and the average seems to have been between seventeen and\r\ntwenty-three. The reasons for this are obvious. Not only were young men\r\nand women more adaptable to changed conditions, more capable of\r\nresisting the Virginia climate, stronger and more vigorous, but they\r\nproved more tractable and entered upon the adventure more eagerly.[3-9]\r\nThese conclusions are fully borne out by an examination of the lists of\r\nservants given in Hotten's _Emigrants to America_. Of the first 159\r\nservants here entered whose ages are attached, the average is\r\ntwenty-three years.[3-10] And as many of these persons were brought over\r\nas skilled artisans to take part in the industrial life which the\r\nCompany had planned for the colony, it is probable that they were much\r\nolder than the average servant of later days who came as an agricultural\r\nlaborer. There is every reason to believe, then, that the average\r\nservant was still in his prime when he completed his term, perhaps not\r\nmore than twenty-six or twenty-seven, with many years of usefulness and\r\nvigor before him.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that the freedman, by a display of energy and\r\ncapability, might acquire property, marry and rear a family. While the\r\nnumber of indentured servants was strictly limited to those who were\r\nbrought in from the outside, the class of poor freemen might and did\r\nenjoy a natural increase within itself. Thus it was inevitable that with\r\nthe passing of the years the servants were more and more outnumbered by\r\nthe growing group of freemen. In 1649, when the population was but\r\n15,000,[3-11] 6,000 servants might well have performed most of the\r\nmanual labor of the tobacco fields, but in 1670, when the inhabitants\r\nnumbered 40,000,[3-12] or in 1697 when they were 70,000,[3-13] they\r\nwould form a comparatively small proportion of the people, so small in\r\nfact that most of the work of necessity had to be done by freemen. In\r\nother words the picture so often presented, even by historians of\r\nestablished reputation, of a Seventeenth century Virginia in which the\r\nland was divided into large plantations owned by rich proprietors and\r\ntilled chiefly by indentured servants is entirely erroneous. Such a\r\nstate of affairs was made impossible by the very nature of the system of\r\nindentures itself.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a matter of prime interest, then, to determine what became of\r\nthe mass of freedmen, what rôle they played in the social and economic\r\nlife of the colony. Because the servant who had completed his term was\r\nfree to follow his own bent, we have no right to assume that he sought\r\nat once to establish himself as an independent proprietor. He might seek\r\nservice with the large planters as a hired laborer, he might become a\r\ntenant. In either case the population would have been divided into two\r\nclasses--the wealthy landowner and those who served him.\r\n\r\nWe know that at all periods of Virginia history there were a certain\r\nnumber of persons employed as wage earners. The colonial laws and the\r\ncounty records contain many references to them. Payment of wages was not\r\nunusual even under the Company, and we are told by George Sandys that\r\nhired laborers received one pound of tobacco a day in addition to their\r\nfood.[3-14] In later years we have from time to time references to wage\r\nrates, and in some cases copies of contracts entered into between\r\nemployer and wage earner. But such cases are comparatively rare, and it\r\nis evident that the use of hired labor throughout the colonial period\r\nwas the exception rather than the rule. In fact it would seem that few\r\nsave servants newly freed and lacking in the funds necessary for\r\npurchasing and equipping little farms of their own ever sought\r\nemployment upon the large plantations. And even in such cases the\r\ncontracts were for comparatively short periods, since it often required\r\nbut a year or two of labor for the freedman to save enough from his\r\nwages to make a beginning as an independent proprietor.\r\n\r\nWhen once established, there was no reason, in the days prior to the\r\nintroduction of slavery, why he should not hold his own in competition\r\nwith his wealthy neighbor. In the production of tobacco the large\r\nplantation, so long as it was cultivated only by expensive white labor,\r\noffered no marked advantage over the small. With the cost of land very\r\nlow, with the means of earning the purchase price so readily in hand,\r\nwith the conditions for an independent career all so favorable, it was\r\nnot to be expected that the freedman should content himself permanently\r\nwith the status of a hired laborer.\r\n\r\nNor was there any reason why he should become a tenant. Had all the\r\nfertile land been preëmpted, as was the case on the banks of the Hudson,\r\nthe poor man might have been compelled to lease the soil upon which he\r\nexpended his efforts or do without entirely. But such was not the case.\r\nIt is true that at the end of the Seventeenth century certain wealthy\r\nmen got possession of large tracts of unsettled land, but their monopoly\r\nwas so far from complete that they gladly sold off their holdings in\r\nlittle parcels to the first purchasers who presented themselves.\r\nApparently they made no attempts to establish themselves in a position\r\nsimilar to that of the great landlords of England.\r\n\r\nThe records afford ample evidence that the leasing of property was by no\r\nmeans unknown in colonial Virginia, but the custom was comparatively\r\nrare. Hugh Jones, writing in 1721, declared that the tenant farmers\r\nconstituted but a small fraction of the population, a fact which he\r\nexplained by the unusual facilities for acquiring property in fee\r\nsimple.[3-15] It would have been folly for the tobacco planter to expend\r\nhis labor upon another man's property, perhaps erecting barns and fences\r\nand otherwise improving it, when he could for so small an outlay secure\r\nland of his own.\r\n\r\nThus we are led to the conclusion that the average Virginia plantation\r\nmust have been comparatively small in extent. The development of large\r\nestates was narrowly limited by the various factors which made it\r\nimpossible to secure an adequate labor supply--the restrictions upon the\r\nslave trade, the insufficient number of indentured servants and the\r\nshortness of their terms, the unwillingness of freedmen and others to\r\nwork for wages. On the other hand, it would be expected that the\r\nservants upon securing their freedom would purchase land of their own,\r\nand cover all tidewater Virginia with little farms.\r\n\r\nTurning to the various records of the time that deal with the\r\ndistribution of land--deeds, wills, transfers, tax lists,\r\ninventories--we find that these conclusions are fully borne out. All\r\nreveal the fact that the average plantation, especially in the\r\nSeventeenth century, so far from vieing with the vast estates in\r\nexistence in certain parts of America, was but a few hundred acres in\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe land transfers of Surry county afford an interesting illustration.\r\nIn thirty-four instances mentioned during the years from 1684 to 1686,\r\nfor which the exact number of acres is given, the largest is 500 acres,\r\nthe smallest twenty. The aggregate of all land which changed hands is\r\n6,355 acres, or an average of 187 for each sale. There are eleven\r\ntransfers of 100 acres or less, twenty-three transfers of 200 or less\r\nand only four of more than 300 acres.[3-16] One can find in this no\r\nevidence of the fabled barons of colonial Virginia, but only of a well\r\nestablished class of small proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe York county books for the years from 1696 to 1701 tell the same\r\nstory. Here we find recorded forty-one transfers and leases. Twenty-two\r\nare for 100 acres or less, 33 for 200 acres or less, and four, one for\r\n1,400, one for 1,210, one for 600 and one for 550, are more than 300\r\nacres in extent. The aggregate is 8,153 acres and the average 199.[3-17]\r\n\r\nIn the Rappahannock county records from 1680 to 1688 of fifteen land\r\ntransfers taken at random from the books, the largest is 400 while the\r\naverage is 168 acres.[3-18] Of the forty-eight transfers mentioned in\r\nthe Essex county books for the years from 1692 to 1695, the largest is\r\n600 acres and the smallest 50. Twenty are for 100 acres or less, 31 for\r\n200 or less and only four for over 300.[3-19]\r\n\r\nThat conditions not fundamentally different prevailed in the early days\r\nof the colony is shown by the census taken of the landowners in 1626. Of\r\nthe holdings listed no less than 25 were for 50 acres or less, 73 for\r\n100 and most of the others for less than 300 acres. The total number of\r\nproprietors listed is 224 and the total acreage 34,472, giving an\r\naverage for each plantation of 154 acres.[3-20]\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed by certain writers that the land grants preserved\r\nin the Registrar's Office in Richmond tend to contradict this evidence.\r\nAlthough the average patent is by no means large, it is much more\r\nextensive than the typical land transfer. In 1638 this average was 423\r\nacres, in 1640 it was 405, in 1642 it was 559, in 1645 it was 333, in\r\n1648 it was 412, in 1650 it was 675. During the entire period from 1634\r\nto 1650 inclusive the size of the average land grant was 446 acres. From\r\n1650 to 1655 the average was 591 acres, from 1655 to 1666 six hundred\r\nand seventy-one, from 1666 to 1679 eight hundred and ninety acres, from\r\n1679 to 1689 six hundred and seven acres, from 1689 to 1695 six hundred\r\nand one acres, from 1695 to 1700 six hundred and eighty-eight\r\nacres.[3-21] In the course of the entire second half of the Seventeenth\r\ncentury the average size of the patent was 674 acres.\r\n\r\nYet these facts have little direct bearing upon the extent of the\r\nplantations themselves. The system of granting land, as we have seen,\r\nwas not based upon the individual needs of the planters, but upon the\r\nnumber of headrights presented to the Government. Obviously it was the\r\nquestion of the most economical method of transporting immigrants which\r\nwould determine the average size of the grant. If it proved best to\r\nbring in servants in small groups, distributed among vessels devoted\r\nchiefly to merchandise, the patents would be small; if they came in on\r\nimmigrant vessels, in numbers ranging from 50 to 200, the patents would\r\nbe large.\r\n\r\nApparently both methods were in vogue. There are grants recorded varying\r\nin size from 50 acres to 10,000 acres.[3-22] Beyond doubt many\r\nmerchants, finding that their vessels on the western voyage were not\r\nfully laden, from time to time took on a few indentured servants. If\r\nthey furnished accommodation for from ten to twenty immigrants, they\r\ncould demand, in addition to the sale of the indentures, 500 to 1,000\r\nacres of land. It was a frequent practice, also, for planters in\r\nVirginia to send orders to their agents in England to procure and ship\r\none or more servants as need for them arose.[3-23] \"Your brother George\r\nhath moved you in his letters to send him over some servants the next\r\nyear,\" wrote Richard Kemp to Robert Read in 1639.[3-24] Undoubtedly in\r\ncases of this kind the servants usually sailed in small parties upon the\r\nregular merchant vessels.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it would appear that large numbers of persons arrived\r\non strictly immigrant vessels, in which they made the chief if not the\r\nonly cargo. Some of the best known men in the colony were dealers in\r\nservants and reaped from the business very large profits. Of these\r\nperhaps the best known in the earlier period was William Claiborne,\r\ncelebrated for his dispute with the Maryland proprietors over the\r\npossession of Kent Island. Peter Ashton was another extensive dealer in\r\nservants, at one time receiving 2,550 acres for his headrights, at\r\nanother 2,000. Isaac Allerton, Lewis Burwell, Giles Brent, Joseph\r\nBridger and many others of like prominence are upon the patent rolls for\r\nlarge grants. The most inveterate dealer in servants, however, was\r\nRobert Beverley. This well known planter, so famous for his part in\r\nBacon's Rebellion and in the political contests which grew out of it, is\r\ncredited with patents aggregating 25,000 or 30,000 acres.[3-25]\r\n\r\nOften partnerships were formed for the importation of servants, in which\r\ncases the patents were made out jointly. Among the more interesting are\r\npatents to Robert Beverley and Henry Hartwell, to Thomas Butt and Thomas\r\nMilner, to William Bassett and James Austin, to Thomas Blunt and Richard\r\nWashington. When associations of three or more persons were formed for\r\nthe importation of servants, a not infrequent occurrence, the number of\r\nheadrights is unusually large and the grants patented in consequence\r\nextensive. Thus Edmund Bibbie and others are credited with 3,350 acres,\r\nRobert Ambrose and others with 6,000, George Archer and others with\r\n4,000.[3-26]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the size of the average patent in the\r\nSeventeenth century is not an indication of the extent of the average\r\nplantation. If economic conditions were such as to encourage large\r\nholdings, extensive farms would appear regardless of the original\r\npatents, for the small proprietors would be driven to the wall by their\r\nmore wealthy rivals and forced to sell out to them. On the other hand,\r\nif the large planters found it difficult to secure adequate labor they\r\nwould of necessity have to break up their estates and dispose of them to\r\nthe small freeholders. That the latter development and not the former\r\nactually took place in Virginia during the Seventeenth century a careful\r\nexamination of the country records makes most apparent.\r\n\r\nOver and over again in the records of various land transfers it is\r\nstated that the property in question had belonged originally to a more\r\nextensive tract, the patent for which was granted under the headright\r\nlaw. A typical case is that of John Dicks who purchased for 8,500 pounds\r\nof tobacco, \"all the remaining part of 900 acres gotten by the\r\ntransporting of 19 persons.\"[3-27] Similarly we find John Johnson in\r\n1653 selling to Robert Roberts half of 900 acres which he had received\r\nby patent.[3-28] In 1693 John Brushood sold to James Grey 200 acres, a\r\npart of 5,100 acres originally granted to Mr. Henry Awbrey.[3-29] Such\r\ncases could be multiplied indefinitely.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most instructive instance left us of this development is the\r\nbreak up of a tract of land known as Button's Ridge, in Essex country.\r\nThis property, comprising 3,650 acres, was granted to Thomas Button in\r\nthe year 1666.[3-30] The original patentee transferred the entire tract\r\nto his brother Robert Button, who in turn sold it to John Baker. The\r\nlatter, finding no doubt that he could not put under cultivation so\r\nmuch land, cut it up into small parcels and sold it off to various\r\nplanters. Of these transactions we have, most fortunately, a fairly\r\ncomplete record. To Captain William Moseley he sold 200 acres, to John\r\nGarnet 600, to Robert Foster 200, to William Smither 200, to William\r\nHowlett 200, to Anthony Samuell 300, to William Williams 200. It is\r\nprobable that he sold also a small holding to Henry Creighton, for we\r\nfind the latter, in 1695, transferring to William Moseley 100 acres,\r\nformerly a part of Button's Ridge.[3-31]\r\n\r\nImportant as are these gleanings from the county records, we have at our\r\ndisposal even better and more conclusive evidence that colonial Virginia\r\nwas divided, not into baronial estates of vast proportions, but into a\r\nlarge number of comparatively small farms. Governor Nicholson's rent\r\nroll, which is published as an appendix to this volume, for the early\r\nyears of the Eighteenth century at least, places the matter beyond\r\ndoubt. Here we have before us an official inventory of all Virginia save\r\nthe Northern Neck, giving the name of every proprietor and the number of\r\nacres in his possession.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the Crown colonies there was a perpetual\r\nobligation imposed upon all land when first granted known as the\r\nquit-rent. In Virginia this duty amounted to one shilling for every\r\nfifty acres, payable in tobacco at the rate of a penny per pound.[3-32]\r\nDespite the fact that some 27 per cent of the returns was consumed by\r\nthe cost of collection, and that there were frequent frauds in disposing\r\nof the tobacco, the revenue derived from this source was of considerable\r\nimportance.[3-33] The amount collected in 1705 was £1,841. 1. 6-3/4.\r\nWhen James Blair, the Virginia Commissary of the Bishop of London,\r\npetitioned William and Mary for a fund from the accumulated quit-rents\r\nfor his proposed college at Williamsburg, some of the British\r\ngovernmental officials objected strenuously. \"This sum is perhaps the\r\nonly ready cash in all the plantations,\" it was declared, \"which happens\r\nto be by good husbandry and is a stock for answering any emergency that\r\nmay happen in Virginia.\"[3-34]\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire Seventeenth century, however, the Governors had\r\nexperienced great difficulty in collecting this tax. Over and over again\r\nthey reported in their letters to the Board of Trade that there were\r\nlarge arrears of quit-rents which it was impossible to make the\r\nlandowners pay.[3-35] The reason for this was obvious enough. In each\r\ncounty the tax collector was the sheriff. Although this officer was\r\nappointed by the Governor, he usually had a wholesome respect for the\r\nlarger proprietors and in consequence was wary of giving offense by\r\nholding them to too strict an account of their estates.[3-36] At times\r\nthe sheriffs themselves were the sufferers by this state of affairs, for\r\nthey were held responsible for the rents upon all land patented in their\r\ncounties, for which returns had not been made.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Governors from time to time made rather feeble attempts to\r\nremedy the prevailing laxness in this matter, nothing of importance was\r\naccomplished before the first administration of Francis Nicholson. The\r\nchief executive himself had much need of the good will of the richer\r\ninhabitants, and he was not over forward in forcing them to bring in\r\naccurate returns. Nicholson, however, who prided himself on his\r\nexecutive ability and who was bent on breaking the power of the clique\r\nwhich centered around the Council of State, exerted himself to the\r\nutmost to secure full payment for every acre.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1690 we find him issuing orders to the sheriffs for the\r\ndrawing up of an accurate rent roll, through an examination of the\r\npatent lists and the records of land transfers.[3-37] May 15, 1691, he\r\ntook up the matter again, warning the sheriffs that he expected more\r\naccurate returns than they had yet made.[3-38] With the appointment of\r\nSir Edmund Andros as Governor, however, interest in the quit-rents\r\nlapsed, and not until his removal and the reappointment of Nicholson was\r\nthe attempt resumed.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1699, Nicholson wrote the Commissioners of Trade and\r\nPlantations that he was doing his best to improve the quit-rents and\r\nthat the auditor had been ordered to draw up a scheme for securing a\r\nmore exact list of land holdings.[3-39] But for a while the matter still\r\nhung fire. The leading men in the Government were ready enough in making\r\nsuggestions, but they were extensive landholders themselves and\r\napparently rendered no real assistance. \"I have considered those papers\r\ngiven me by your Excellency relating to a perfect rent roll,\" the\r\nauditor, William Byrd I wrote Nicholson, Oct. 21, 1703, \"notwithstanding\r\nI have, according to your repeated directions used my utmost diligence\r\nin giving charge to sheriffs and taking their oaths to rolls, I am\r\nsensible there is still very great abuse therein.\"[3-40]\r\n\r\nDespite these discouragements Nicholson persisted and in 1704 succeeded\r\nin obtaining the first really accurate rent roll of the colony. These\r\nlists have long been missing, and perhaps were destroyed in one of the\r\nseveral fires which have wrought so much havoc with the records of\r\ncolonial Virginia, but a true copy was made by the clerk, William\r\nRobertson, and sent to the Board of Trade. Fortunately the British\r\nGovernment has been more careful of its priceless historical manuscripts\r\nthan has Virginia, and this copy today reposes in the Public Record\r\nOffice in London, a veritable treasure trove of information concerning\r\neconomic and social conditions in the colony.[3-41]\r\n\r\nEven a cursory examination of the rent roll is sufficient to dispel the\r\nold belief that Virginia at this time was the land of the large\r\nproprietor. As one glances down the list of plantations he is struck by\r\nthe number of little holdings, the complete absence of huge estates, the\r\ncomparative scarcity even of those that for a newly settled country\r\nmight be termed extensive. Here and there, especially in the frontier\r\ncounties is listed a tract of four or five or even ten thousand acres,\r\nbut such cases are very rare. In Middlesex county there is but one\r\nplantation of more than 2,500 acres, in Charles City county the largest\r\nholding is 3,130, in Nansemond 2,300, in Norfolk county 3,200, in\r\nPrincess Anne 3,100, in Elizabeth City county 2,140, in York 2,750, in\r\nEssex 3,200.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the rolls reveal the existence of thousands of little\r\nproprietors, whose holdings of from 50 to 500 acres embraced the larger\r\npart of the cultivated soil of the colony. Thus we find that in\r\nNansemond, of 376 farms 26 were of 50 acres or less, 66 were between 50\r\nand 100 acres, 110 between 100 and 200 acres, 88 between 200 and 400\r\nacres, 78 between 400 and 1,000 acres, and only eight over 1,000 acres.\r\nIn Middlesex county out of 122 holdings eleven were of 50 acres or less,\r\n33 between 50 and 100 acres, 32 between 100 and 200 acres, 25 between\r\n200 and 500 acres, 19 between 500 and 2,500 acres, one of 4,000 acres\r\nand one of 5,200 acres. Of the 94 plantations in Charles City county 26\r\nwere of 100 acres or less, 21 between 100 and 200 acres, 25 between 200\r\nand 500 acres, 19 between 500 and 2,500 acres and three more than 2,500\r\nacres.[3-42]\r\n\r\nAlthough the average size of the plantations varied considerably in\r\ndifferent counties it was everywhere comparatively small, far smaller\r\nthan the average land grant of the time, far smaller than has been\r\nimagined by some of the closest students of the period. For Nansemond\r\nthe rolls reveal the average holding as 212 acres, for James City county\r\n400, for York 298, for Warwick 308, for Elizabeth City county 255, for\r\nPrincess Anne 459, for Gloucester 395, for Middlesex 406, for Charles\r\nCity county 553.[3-43]\r\n\r\nIn the past few decades much has been written of the social life and\r\ncustoms of the people of colonial Virginia. But except in the able works\r\nof Dr. Philip Alexander Bruce little has been said concerning the small\r\nplanter class, the men who made up the vast bulk of the population, the\r\ntrue Seventeenth century Virginians. We have long and detailed\r\ndescriptions of the residences of the small group of the well-to-do,\r\ntheir libraries, their furniture, their table ware, their portraits,\r\ntheir clothing, their amusements. The genealogy of the leading families\r\nhas been worked out with minute care, their histories recorded, some of\r\ntheir leading members idealized by the writers of fiction. The mention\r\nof colonial Virginia brings instantly to mind a picture of gay\r\ncavaliers, of stately ladies, of baronial estates, of noble manors. And\r\nthe sturdy, independent class of small farmers who made up a full 90 per\r\ncent of the freeholders at the time the rent roll was taken, have been\r\nrelegated into undeserved obscurity.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the roll does not include the names of\r\nproprietors residing in the Northern Neck, as the peninsula between the\r\nPotomac and the Rappahannock is called. This territory, although\r\nacknowledging the jurisdiction of the Government at Williamsburg in most\r\nmatters and sending representatives to the House of Burgesses, paid its\r\nquit-rents, not to the Crown but to a proprietor. Nicholson, therefore,\r\nwas not concerned in their collection and took no steps to list its\r\nlandholders in his new roll. There is no reason to believe, however,\r\nthat conditions in that part of the colony were fundamentally different.\r\n\r\nNor can the accuracy of the rent roll be challenged. There existed\r\nalways the incentive to make false returns, of course, in order to\r\nescape the payment of taxes, and not many sheriffs were so diligent as\r\nthe one in Henrico who unearthed 1,669 acres that had been\r\n\"concealed.\"[3-44] Yet it must be remembered that the Governor brought\r\nto bear all the pressure at his disposal to make this particular roll\r\naccurate, that the sheriffs were his appointees, that they could not\r\nlightly defy him in so important a matter. And even though in isolated\r\ncases they may have winked at false returns from men of wealth and rank,\r\nfrom the mass of small proprietors they must have insisted upon reports\r\nas accurate as the records or actual surveying could make them. No doubt\r\ncertain uncultivated tracts in the frontier counties were omitted, but\r\nwith these we are not immediately concerned. For conditions in the older\r\nparts of the colony, where the slow evolution of economic factors had\r\nbeen at work for a century, the roll presents unimpeachable evidence\r\nthat the bulk of the cultivated land was divided into small plantations.\r\n\r\nBut it still remains to prove that their owners were men of meagre\r\nfortunes, men who tilled the soil with their own hands. After all a farm\r\nof two or three hundred acres might give scope for large activities, the\r\nemployment of many servants and slaves, the acquisition of some degree\r\nof wealth. Might it not be possible that though the acres of the planter\r\nwere limited, his estate after all corresponded somewhat with the\r\npopular conception?\r\n\r\nThis leads us to a study of the distribution of servants and slaves\r\namong the planters. At the outset we are faced with convincing evidence\r\nthat at the end of the Seventeenth century the average number for each\r\nfarm was very small. This is shown by a comparison of the number of\r\nplantations listed in the rent roll of 1704 with the estimated number of\r\nworkers. In the counties for which the sheriffs made returns for\r\nGovernor Nicholson there were some 5,500 landholders. When to these is\r\nadded the proprietors of the Northern Neck the number must have\r\napproximated 6,500. If at this time the servants numbered 4,000, as\r\nseems probable,[3-45] and the slaves 6,000, together they would have\r\naveraged but 1.5 workers for each plantation. A decade earlier, when the\r\nuse of slaves was still comparatively infrequent, the figure must have\r\nbeen still lower.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have even more direct and detailed evidence. Throughout\r\nalmost all of Virginia colonial history one of the chief methods of\r\nraising revenue for the Government was the direct poll tax. This levy\r\nwas laid, however, not only on every freeman over sixteen years of age,\r\nbut upon male servants over 14, female servants who worked in the\r\nfields, and slaves above 16 of either sex, all of whom were officially\r\ntermed tithables.[3-46] The tax rolls in which these persons were\r\nlisted, some of which have been preserved among the county records,\r\nthrow much light upon social and economic conditions in the colony.\r\n\r\nIn one district of Surry county we find in the year 1675 that there were\r\n75 taxpayers and only 126 tithables. In other words only 51 persons in\r\nthis district had this duty paid for them by others, whether parents,\r\nguardians or masters. And of the taxpayers, forty-two were liable for\r\nthemselves alone, having no servants, slaves or dependent sons over 16;\r\nfifteen were liable for one other person, eight for two others, and only\r\none, Lieutenant-Colonel Jordan, for so many as seven.[3-47]\r\n\r\nIn other districts the story is the same. In one there were forty\r\ntaxpayers, 75 tithables and 25 persons who paid for themselves alone; in\r\nanother 28 taxpayers, 62 tithables, fifteen who had no servants or\r\nslaves; in a third 48 taxpayers, 83 tithables, 28 who paid only for\r\nthemselves, eleven who paid for two, five who paid for three; in a\r\nfourth district 29 taxpayers, 63 tithables, fourteen who had no servants\r\nor slaves; in a fifth 25 taxpayers, 45 tithables, 12 who paid only for\r\nthemselves.[3-48] Thus in Surry county in the year 1675 there were in\r\nall 245 taxpayers and 434 tithables. In other words the men who paid\r\ntheir own tax outnumbered all those whose tax was paid for them, whether\r\nservants, slaves or relatives, at the ratio of about 4 to 3.\r\n\r\nA study of the records of the same county ten years later leads to\r\nalmost identical results. At that time Surry seems to have been divided\r\ninto four districts. In the first there were 78 taxpayers, 132\r\ntithables, 30 persons who paid only for themselves; in the second, 63\r\ntaxpayers, 133 tithables, 33 persons who paid for themselves alone; in\r\nthe third there were 38 taxpayers, 74 tithables and 22 persons paying\r\nonly for themselves; in the fourth 125 taxpayers, 201 tithables and 81\r\npersons having no dependents to pay for. Thus there were 540 tithables\r\nin all and 304 taxpayers. In the entire county there were about 122\r\npersons who paid the poll tax for others. The largest holders of\r\nservants or slaves were Mr. Robert Randall with seven, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nWilliam Browne with nine, Mr. Robert Canfield with seven, Mr. Arthur\r\nAllen with six, Mr. William Edwards with six, Mr. Francis Mason with\r\nseven and Mr. Thomas Binns with eight.[3-49]\r\n\r\nHere again is proof that the popular conception of the Virginia\r\nplantation life of the Seventeenth century is erroneous. Instead of the\r\nwealthy planter who surrounded himself with scores of servants and\r\nslaves, investigation reveals hundreds of little farmers, many of them\r\ntrusting entirely to their own exertions for the cultivation of the\r\nsoil, others having but one or two servants, and a bare handful of\r\nwell-to-do men each having from five to ten, or in rare cases twenty or\r\nthirty, servants and slaves.\r\n\r\nA further confirmation of these conclusions is to be had by comparing\r\nthe number of plantations listed in the rent roll of 1704 with the\r\nofficial returns of tithables for 1702.[3-50] Thus in Nansemond there\r\nwere 375 plantations and 1,030 tithables, Henrico with 162 plantations\r\nhad 863 tithables, Middlesex with 122 plantations had 814 tithables,\r\nGloucester with 381 plantations had 2,626, James City with 287\r\nplantations had 1,193, York with 205 plantations had 1,180, Warwick with\r\n122 plantations had 505, Elizabeth City with 116 plantations had 478,\r\nPrincess Anne with 215 plantations had 727, Surry with 273 plantations\r\nhad 739, Isle of Wight with 262 plantations had 896, Norfolk with 303\r\nplantations had 693, New Kent with 497 plantations had 1,245, King\r\nWilliam with 217 plantations had 803, King and Queen with 403\r\nplantations had 1,848, Essex with 376 plantations had 1,034, Accomac\r\nwith 392 plantations had 1,041, Northampton with 258 plantations had\r\n693, Charles City and Prince George together with 420 plantations had\r\n1,327.[3-51]\r\n\r\nIn Nansemond the average number of tithables as compared with the number\r\nof plantations was 2.7, in Henrico 5.1, in Middlesex 6.7, in Gloucester\r\n6.9, in James City 4.2, in York 5.7, in Warwick 4.1, in Elizabeth City\r\n4, in Princess Anne 3.4, in Surry 2.7, in Isle of Wight 3.3, in Norfolk\r\n2.3, in New Kent 2.5, in King William 3.7, in King and Queen 4.6, in\r\nEssex 2.8, in Accomac 2.6, in Northampton 2.3, in Charles City and\r\nPrince George combined 3.1. In all Virginia, with the exclusion of the\r\nNorthern Neck, there were 19,715 tithables and some 5,500 plantations,\r\nan average of 3.6 tithables for each plantation. If we deduct from the\r\ntithables all the male freeholders included in the rent roll, there\r\nremains only some 14,700 persons south of the Rappahannock to make up\r\nthe list, not only of servants and slaves, but of professional men, wage\r\nearners, artisans and dependent sons of landholders over 16 years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAnother invaluable source of information concerning the distribution of\r\nservants and slaves is provided by the numerous inventories, deeds, and\r\nwills which have been preserved in the records. Thus in Surry during the\r\nyears from 1671 to 1686 we find listed the estates of fifty-nine\r\npersons. Of these no less than fifty-two were apparently without\r\nservants or slaves; two, William Rooking and Captain Robert Spencer, had\r\nfive each; one, Mr. William Chambers, had three; and four, Captain\r\nWilliam Corker, John Hoge, Mr. John Goring and Samuel Cornell, had one\r\neach.[3-52]\r\n\r\nIn Elizabeth City of twenty-seven estates recorded during the years from\r\n1684 to 1699 sixteen were without servants or slaves; of twenty-six\r\nrecorded in York during the period from 1694 to 1697 thirteen had no\r\nservants or slaves; of twenty-three recorded in Henrico from 1677 to\r\n1692 fourteen were without servants or slaves.[3-53] It is true that\r\nthese inventories and wills, since they would usually pertain to persons\r\nof advanced age, perhaps do not furnish an absolutely accurate gauge of\r\nthe average number of servants held by each planter. On the other hand,\r\nit is equally probable that a larger proportion of big estates than of\r\nthe small found their way into the records. At all events it is evident\r\nthat a goodly proportion of the landholders, perhaps sixty or sixty-five\r\nper cent possessed no slaves or indentured servants, and trusted solely\r\nto their own exertions for the cultivation of their plantations.\r\n\r\nThus vanishes the fabled picture of Seventeenth century Virginia. In its\r\nplace we see a colony filled with little farms a few hundred acres in\r\nextent, owned and worked by a sturdy class of English farmers. Prior to\r\nthe slave invasion which marked the close of the Seventeenth century and\r\nthe opening of the Eighteenth, the most important factor in the life of\r\nthe Old Dominion was the white yeomanry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IV_\r\n\r\nFREEMEN AND FREEDMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the small planter class had its origin partly in the\r\nimmigration of persons who paid their own passage, partly in the\r\ngraduation into freedmen of large numbers of indentured servants. But to\r\ndetermine accurately the proportion of each is a matter of great\r\ndifficulty. Had all the records of Seventeenth century Virginia been\r\npreserved, it would have been possible, by means of long and laborious\r\ninvestigation, to arrive at strictly accurate conclusions. But with the\r\nmaterial in hand one has to be satisfied with an approximation of the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIt must again be emphasized that the indentured servants were not\r\nslaves, and that at the expiration of their terms there was no barrier,\r\nlegal, racial or social to their advancement. The Lords of Trade and\r\nPlantations, in 1676, expressed their dissatisfaction at the word\r\n\"servitude\" as applied to them, which they felt was a mark of bondage\r\nand slavery, and thought it better \"rather to use the word service,\r\nsince those servants are only apprentices for years.\"[4-1] \"Malitious\r\ntongues have impaired it (Virginia) much,\" Bullock declared in 1649,\r\n\"for it hath been a constant report among the ordinary sort of people\r\nthat all those servants who are sent to Virginia are sold into slavery,\r\nwhereas the truth is that the merchants who send servants and have no\r\nplantations of their own doe not only transferre their time over to\r\nothers, but the servants serve no longer than the time they themselves\r\nagreed for in England, and this is the ordinary course in England, and\r\nno prejudice or hurt to the servant.\"[4-2]\r\n\r\nThe terms of indenture not only took for granted that the servant, upon\r\ncompleting his contract, would establish himself as a proprietor, but\r\nusually made it obligatory for the master to furnish him with the\r\nequipment necessary for his new life. With rare exceptions he received a\r\nquantity of grain sufficient to maintain him for one year; two suits,\r\none of Kersey, the other of cotton; a pair of canvas drawers; two\r\nshirts; and one felt hat.[4-3] The historian Beverley states that to\r\nthis outfit was added a gun worth twenty shillings.[4-4] Another writer\r\ntells us that the freedman received \"a year's provision of corne, double\r\napparel\" and a supply of tools.[4-5]\r\n\r\nThere existed in England a widespread impression that the servant, upon\r\nsecuring his freedom, was entitled by law to fifty acres of land. This\r\nappears to have been a mistake arising from a misapprehension of the\r\nnature of the headright, which belonged not to the servant himself, but\r\nto the person who paid for his transportation. In many cases the\r\nindentures do not state the exact rewards to be received by the new\r\nfreedman, but only that they are to accord with \"the custom of the\r\ncountry,\" a very elastic term which could be construed by the master to\r\nsuit his own interest.[4-6] John Hammond, in his _Leah and Rachel_,\r\nstrongly advised the immigrant before affixing his signature to the\r\nindenture to insist upon the inclusion of a clause specifically\r\nproviding for the payment of the fifty acres.[4-7] But the importance\r\nwhich attaches to this matter lies as much in the servant's expectation\r\nas in its fulfilment. Whether or not he received his little plantation,\r\nhe believed that he was to get a tract of land, a very extensive tract\r\nit must have seemed to him, which would assure him a good living and\r\nmake it possible for him to rise out of the class to which he\r\nbelonged.[4-8]\r\n\r\nIn 1627 the Virginia General Court issued an order which is significant\r\nof the attitude of the colony itself to the freedmen. \"The Court, taking\r\ninto consideration that the next ensueing year there will be many\r\ntenants and servants freed unto whom after their freedom there will be\r\nno land due, whereby they may without some order taken to the contrary\r\nsettle and seat themselves ... have ordered that the Governor and\r\nCouncil may give unto the said servants and tenants leases for terms of\r\nyears such quantities of land as shall be needful.\"[4-9] Thus, at this\r\nperiod at least, not only was it expected in the colony that servants\r\nwould become land holders, but it was felt that for them not to do so\r\nwas a matter of such grave concern as to require the special attention\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the key to the situation must be sought in the\r\nhistory of tobacco culture and the tobacco trade. Tobacco was the\r\nuniversal crop of the colony and upon it every man depended for his\r\nadvancement and prosperity. If the market was good and the price high,\r\nthe planters flourished; if sales fell off and the price was low, they\r\nsuffered accordingly. It is evident, then, that the ability of the\r\nfreedman to secure a position of economic independence hinged upon the\r\nprofit to be derived from his little tobacco crop. It does not matter\r\nwhether he worked as a wage earner, tenant or freeholder, in the end the\r\nresult would be the same. If the returns from his labor greatly exceeded\r\nhis expenses, his savings would make it possible for him to establish\r\nhimself firmly in the class of the colonial yeomanry. On the other hand,\r\nif he could wring from the soil no more than a bare subsistence, he\r\nwould remain always a poor laborer, or perhaps be forced to seek his\r\nfortune in some other colony. Thus if we are to understand the status of\r\nthe freed servant and the hope which he could entertain of advancement,\r\nit is necessary to turn our attention once more to economic conditions\r\nin the colony. First, we must determine the amount of tobacco the\r\nfreedman could produce by his unassisted labor; second, the price he\r\nreceived for it; third, how much he had to give the merchants in\r\nexchange for their wares; and finally, the margin of profit left after\r\nall expenses had been paid.\r\n\r\nDespite a marked divergence of testimony regarding the amount of tobacco\r\none man could cultivate, we are able to determine this matter with some\r\ndegree of exactness. In 1627 the King, in outlining a plan to take into\r\nhis own hands the entire tobacco trade, proposed to limit the imports to\r\n200 pounds for each master of a family and 125 for each servant.[4-10]\r\nTo this, however, the planters entered a vigorous protest, claiming that\r\nthe quantity was \"not sufficient for their maintenance.\" They in turn\r\nsuggested that the King take a total of 500,000 pounds a year, which for\r\na population of 3,000 meant 167 pounds for each inhabitant, or perhaps\r\nabout 500 pounds for each actual laborer.[4-11] Again in 1634 it was\r\nproposed that the Crown purchase yearly 600,000 pounds of Virginia\r\ntobacco.[4-12] As the population of the colony at that date was about\r\n5,000, this would have allowed only 120 pounds for each person, and once\r\nmore the planters protested vigorously.[4-13] It would seem that both of\r\nthese offers were based not so much upon the amount that one man could\r\nraise as upon the quantity which could be sold in England at a certain\r\nprice. In fact it is probable that even so early as 1628 the average\r\noutput of one freedman was not less than 1,000 pounds. It is interesting\r\nto note that in 1640, soon after Governor Francis Wyatt's arrival from\r\nEngland, it was found that the excessive crop of the previous year had\r\nso clogged the market that upon the advice of the merchants the\r\nGovernment was \"forced to a strict way of destroying the bad and halfe\r\nthe goode.\"[4-14]\r\n\r\nThe author of _A New Description of Virginia_, published in 1649, claims\r\nthat one man could plant from 1,600 to 2,000 pounds a year.[4-15] As the\r\npamphlet presents a somewhat optimistic picture of affairs in general in\r\nthe colony, this estimate must be taken with some reserve. More\r\ntrustworthy is the statement of Secretary Thomas Ludwell in 1667 that\r\n1,200 pounds was \"the medium of men's yearly crops.\"[4-16]\r\n\r\nAt all events, it is evident that the planter, even when entirely\r\ndependent upon his own exertions, could produce a goodly crop. It is now\r\nnecessary to ascertain what he got for it. In the second and third\r\ndecades of the Seventeenth century the price of tobacco was very high.\r\nThe first cargo, consisting of 20,000 pounds consigned in the George,\r\nsold for no less than £5,250, or 5s. 3d. a pound.[4-17] No wonder the\r\nleaders of the London Company were pleased, believing that in the Indian\r\nweed they had discovered a veritable gold mine! No wonder the settlers\r\ndeserted their pallisades and their villages to seek out the richest\r\nsoil and the spots best suited for tobacco culture! The man who could\r\nproduce 200 pounds of the plant, after all freight charges had been met,\r\ncould clear some £30 or £35, a very tidy sum indeed for those days. It\r\nwas the discovery that Virginia could produce tobacco of excellent\r\nquality that accounts for the heavy migration in the years from 1618 to\r\n1623. In fact, so rich were the returns that certain persons came to the\r\ncolony, not with the intention of making it their permanent residence,\r\nbut of enriching themselves \"by a cropp of Tobacco,\" and then returning\r\nto England to enjoy the proceeds.[4-18]\r\n\r\nBut this state of affairs was of necessity temporary. Very soon the\r\nincreasing size of the annual crop began to tell upon the price, and in\r\n1623 Sir Nathaniel Rich declared that he had bought large quantities of\r\ntobacco at two shillings a pound.[4-19] This gentleman felt that it\r\nwould be just to the planters were they to receive two shillings and\r\nfour pence for the best varieties, and sixteen pence for the \"second\r\nsort.\" In the same year Governor Wyatt and his Council, in a letter to\r\nthe Virginia Company, placed the valuation of tobacco at eighteen pence\r\na pound.[4-20] Three years later, however, the Governor wrote the Privy\r\nCouncil advising the establishment in Virginia of a \"magazine\" or\r\nentrepot, where the merchants should be compelled to take the tobacco at\r\nthree shillings a pound.[4-21] This proposal did not seem reasonable to\r\nthe King, and when Sir George Yeardley came over as Governor for the\r\nsecond time he was instructed to see to it that \"the merchant be not\r\nconstrained to take tobacco at 3. P. Pound in exchange for his wares,\"\r\nand to permit him to \"make his own bargain.\"[4-22]\r\n\r\nApparently not discouraged by this rebuff, in 1628 the Governor, Council\r\nand Burgesses petitioned the King, who once more was planning to take\r\nthe trade into his own hands, to grant them \"for their tobacco delivered\r\nin the colony three shillings and six pence per pound, and in England,\r\nfour shillings.\"[4-23] This valuation undoubtedly was far in advance of\r\nthe current prices, and King Charles, considering it unreasonable would\r\nnot come to terms with the planters. In fact, it appears that for some\r\nyears the price of tobacco had been declining rapidly. In May, 1630, Sir\r\nJohn Harvey wrote the Privy Council that the merchants had bought the\r\nlast crop with their commodities at less than a penny per pound,[4-24]\r\nand two years later, in a statement sent the Virginia Commissioners, he\r\nclaimed that the price still remained at that figure.[4-25]\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted, however, that this estimate was far below\r\nthe actual price. The planters showed a decided tendency to blow hot or\r\ncold according to the purpose in view, and in these two particular\r\nstatements Sir John was pleading for better treatment from the\r\nmerchants. Yet it is reasonably certain that tobacco was at a low ebb in\r\nthe years from 1629 to 1633, and sold at a small fraction of the figures\r\nof the preceding decade.[4-26] The Governor repeatedly wrote asking for\r\nrelief, while in the Assembly attempts were made to restore the market\r\nby restricting the size of the annual crop.[4-27]\r\n\r\nYet things must have taken a favorable turn soon after, for in 1634 the\r\nplanters informed the King's Commissioners that they would not sell him\r\ntheir tobacco at less than six pence in Virginia and fourteen pence\r\ndelivered in England.[4-28] Later the King wrote to the Governor and\r\nCouncil that the rate had recently \"doubly or trebly advanced.\"[4-29]\r\nThis is substantiated by the fact that the Commissioners, in 1638,\r\nallowed the planters \"4d. a pound clear of all charges,\" despite which\r\nthey complained that in an open market they could do better.[4-30]\r\n\r\nIn 1638 several prominent Virginians estimated that on an average during\r\nthe preceding eleven years they had received not more than two pence for\r\ntheir tobacco, but here again it is probable that there was some\r\nexaggeration.[4-31] In 1649 the author of _A New Description of\r\nVirginia_ stated that tobacco sold in Virginia for three pence a\r\npound.[4-32] All in all it seems that prices in the early years of the\r\nsettlement varied from five shillings to a few pence, that a disastrous\r\nslump occurred at the end of the third decade, followed by a rapid\r\nrecovery which brought the rate to about three pence, at which figure it\r\nremained fairly constant for twenty-five years or more throughout the\r\nCivil War and most of the Commonwealth periods.\r\n\r\nThe return which the Virginia farmer received from his one staple crop\r\nwas determined by a number of factors over which he himself had but\r\nlittle control. Had he been permitted to seek his own market and drive\r\nhis own bargain free from the restraining hand of the British\r\nGovernment, no doubt he would have secured a much better price. But from\r\nthe moment it became apparent that the Virginia tobacco rivalled in\r\nflavor that of the Spanish colonies and could command as ready a sale\r\nthroughout Europe, the trade was subjected to various regulations and\r\nrestrictions which proved most vexatious to the colony and elicited\r\nfrequent and vigorous protests. Neither James nor Charles had any idea\r\nof permitting free trade. In their prolonged struggle with the liberal\r\nparty both saw in tobacco a ready means of aiding the Exchequer, and so\r\nof advancing toward the goal of financial independence. These monarchs\r\nwere by no means hostile to Virginia. In fact, both took great interest\r\nin the tiny settlement upon the James, which they looked upon as the\r\nbeginning of the future British colonial empire. Yet they lent too\r\nwilling an ear to those who argued that tobacco might be made to yield a\r\ngoodly revenue to the Crown without injury to the planters.\r\n\r\nThe policy adopted by the early Stuart kings and adhered to with but\r\nminor changes throughout the colonial period consisted of four essential\r\nfeatures. First, the tobacco raised in the plantations should be sent\r\nonly to England; second, upon entering the mother country it must pay a\r\nduty to the Crown; third, Spanish tobacco should be excluded or its\r\nimportation strictly limited; lastly, the cultivation of the plant in\r\nEngland itself was forbidden.\r\n\r\nIn the years when the colony was still weak and dependent upon the\r\nmother country this program was not unfair. The prohibition of tobacco\r\ngrowing in England, however unnecessary it would have been under\r\nconditions of free trade, was felt by the planters to be a real\r\nconcession, while the restrictions upon foreign importations saved them\r\nfrom dangerous competition at the very time when they were least able to\r\ncombat it. Nor were they seriously injured by the imposition of the\r\ncustoms duties. The planters themselves imagined that the incidence of\r\nthis tax fell upon their own shoulders and that they were impoverished\r\nto the full extent of the revenues derived from it. But in this they\r\nwere mistaken. The duty, in the last resort, was paid not by the\r\nplanters but by the British consumers. The colonists were affected\r\nadversely only in so far as the enhanced price of tobacco in England\r\nrestricted the market.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the prohibition of foreign trade was a very real\r\ngrievance and elicited frequent protests from the planters. Dutch\r\nmerchants paid high prices for the Virginia tobacco and offered their\r\nmanufactured goods in return at figures far below those of the British\r\ntraders. The Virginians could not understand why they should not take\r\nadvantage of this opportunity. \"I humbly desire to be informed from your\r\nhonors,\" wrote Governor Harvey to the Virginia Commissioners in 1632,\r\n\"whether there be any obstacle why we may not have the same freedome of\r\nhis Majesties other subjects to seek our best market.\"[4-33]\r\n\r\nBut Harvey was attacking what already had become a fixed policy of the\r\nCrown, a policy which was to remain the cornerstone of the British\r\ncolonial system for centuries. The Government had, therefore, not the\r\nslightest intention of yielding, and from time to time issued strict\r\norders that all colonial tobacco, whether of Virginia or the West\r\nIndies, be brought only to England or to English colonies. When Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley was appointed Governor in 1642 he was instructed to\r\n\"bee verry careful that no ships or other vessels whatsoever depart from\r\nthence, freighted with tobacco or other commodities which that country\r\nshall afford, before bond with sufficient securities be taken to his\r\nMajesty's use, to bring the same directly into his Majesty's Dominions\r\nand not elsewhere.\"[4-34]\r\n\r\nDespite the insistence of the British Government in this matter, there\r\nis abundant evidence to show that the Virginians continued to indulge in\r\ndirect trade with the continent for many years after the overthrow of\r\nthe Company. In 1632 Governor Harvey wrote that \"our intrudinge\r\nneighbours, the Dutch, doe allow us eighteen peance p. pound\" for\r\ntobacco, while a few months later we find him reporting the attempt of\r\nJohn Constable and others \"to defraud his Majesty of his duties by\r\nunloading in the Netherlands.\"[4-35]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the English Civil War and throughout the Commonwealth\r\nperiod Virginia enjoyed a large degree of independence and found it\r\npossible to trade with the Dutch almost with impunity. Even the strict\r\nBerkeley seems to have felt it no disloyalty for the planters to seek\r\nforeign markets for their staple while the mother country was torn by\r\nthe contending armies of King and Parliament. And so the merchantmen of\r\nFlushing and Amsterdam pushed their prows into every river and creek in\r\nVirginia and Maryland, taking off large quantities of tobacco and giving\r\nin return the celebrated manufactured goods of their own country. At\r\nChristmas 1648, if we may believe the testimony of the author of _A New\r\nDescription of Virginia_, there were trading in the colony ten ships\r\nfrom London, two from Bristol, seven from New England and twelve from\r\nHolland. In 1655 the statement was made that \"there was usually found\r\nintruding upon the plantation divers ships, surruptitiously carrying\r\naway the growth thereof to foreign ports to the prejudice of this\r\nCommonwealth.\"[4-36]\r\n\r\nThus in the years prior to the Restoration Virginia was never fully\r\nsubjected to the operation of the British colonial system. When the\r\nprice of tobacco in the London market fell lower and lower, the planters\r\nmight and often did find relief by defying the King's commands and\r\ntrading directly with the Dutch.[4-37] And this benefitted them doubly,\r\nfor not only did they strike a better bargain with the foreign traders,\r\nbut every cargo of tobacco diverted from England tended to relieve the\r\nmarket there and restore prices. In fact there can be little doubt that\r\nthe frequent violations of the trade restrictions of this period alone\r\nsaved the colony from the poverty and distress of later days and made\r\npossible the prosperity enjoyed by the planters.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted also that of the tobacco sent to England itself, a part\r\nwas reshipped to foreign countries. In 1610 a law was enacted for the\r\nrefunding of all import duties upon articles that were re-exported. This\r\ndrawback applied also to colonial products, but under Charles I an\r\nexception was made in their case and the privilege withdrawn. In\r\nconsequence the importers made a vigorous protest in Parliament, and the\r\nKing, in 1631, modified his policy by ordering that of the nine pence\r\nduty then in operation, six pence should be refunded when the tobacco\r\nwas shipped abroad. In 1632 the drawback was increased to seven pence\r\nleaving the total duty paid by the merchants who traded through England\r\nto foreign countries two pence a pound only.[4-38] Although this\r\nconstituted a most serious obstacle to trade and at times aroused the\r\nmerchants to bitter protest, it by no means completely blocked\r\nre-exportation. So great were the natural qualifications of Virginia for\r\nproducing tobacco, that it was possible to purchase a cargo from the\r\nplanters on the James, proceed with it to London, pay there the two\r\npence a pound duty, reship it to the continent and sell it there at a\r\nprofit.[4-39] Although this trade was not extensive, it must have had an\r\nimportant influence in maintaining prices and in bringing prosperity to\r\nall classes in the colony.\r\n\r\nThus Virginia, contrary to the wishes of the mother country and in\r\ndefiance of her regulations, enjoyed for its staple product in the years\r\nprior to 1660, a world market. Whether by direct trade or by\r\nre-exportation from England a goodly share of the annual crop was\r\nconsumed in foreign countries, a share which had it been left in England\r\nto clog the market, would have reacted disastrously upon all concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, then, that in the first half century of its existence\r\nVirginia was the land of opportunity. The poor man who came to her\r\nshores, whether under terms of indenture or as a freeman, found it quite\r\npossible to establish himself as a person of some property and\r\nconsideration. We may imagine the case of the servant who had completed\r\nhis term and secured his freedom at any time during the third decade of\r\nthe Seventeenth century. As we have seen, it was an easy matter for him\r\nto secure a small patch of land and the tools with which to cultivate\r\nit. By his unassisted efforts, if he applied himself steadily to the\r\ntask, he could produce a good crop of tobacco, consisting perhaps of\r\nsome 400 pounds. This he could sell to the merchants for from two\r\nshillings to six pence a pound, or a total of from £10 to £40.[4-40]\r\n\r\nIn the years from 1630 to 1640, when the price of tobacco seems to have\r\nstabilized itself at from two to three pence, cases of such\r\nextraordinary returns must have been of less frequent occurrence, but to\r\nsome extent lower prices were offset by larger crops. If our freedman in\r\n1635 could raise 800 pounds of leaf and dispose of it for four pence,\r\nhis income would be £13.6.8; in 1649, by producing 1,000 pounds, he\r\ncould sell it at three pence for £12.10.0. In fact, it is not too much\r\nto say that the average annual income from the labor of one able worker\r\nat any time prior to 1660 was not less than £12. When we take into\r\nconsideration the fact that the planter produced his own food, and that\r\nout of the proceeds of his tobacco crop he paid only his taxes and his\r\nbills to the English importers, it is evident that he had a goodly\r\nmargin of profit to lay aside as working capital.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that this margin was greatly reduced\r\nby the high cost of clothing, farm implements and all other articles\r\nbrought from across the ocean. The long and dangerous voyage from London\r\nto the Chesapeake made the freight rates excessive, while the merchants\r\ndid not scruple to drive a hard bargain whenever possible. The letters\r\nof the Governors are filled with complaints against the exactions of\r\nthese men. \"This year the Merchants have bought our tobacco with their\r\ncommodities at less than a penny the pounde,\" Harvey wrote in 1630, \"and\r\nhave not shamed to make the planters pay twelve pounds Sterlinge the\r\ntunn freight home.\"[4-41] Two years later he complained that a certain\r\nCaptain Tucker had just sailed leaving his stores well stocked with\r\ngoods, but with \"instructions to his factors not to sell but at most\r\nexcessive rates.\"[4-42] In 1628, the Governor, Council and Burgesses, in\r\na petition to the King, declared that for years they had \"groaned under\r\nthe oppression of unconscionable and cruel merchants by the excessive\r\nrates of their commodities.\"[4-43] Six years later Governor Harvey\r\nstated that all things which \"come hither\" are sold at \"thrice the value\r\nthey cost in England.\"[4-44]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that after all expenses had been paid, a goodly\r\nmargin of profit was left, a margin perhaps averaging some three or four\r\npounds sterling. The provident and industrious immigrant, a few years\r\nafter the conclusion of his term, might well lay aside enough to make it\r\npossible for him in turn to secure a servant from England. This\r\naccomplished, he at once rose into the class of employers and his future\r\nadvance was limited only by his capabilities and his ambition.\r\n\r\nWe would naturally expect to find, then, that during these years a large\r\npercentage of those who came to the colony under terms of indenture,\r\nsooner or later acquired land, perhaps bought servants, and became\r\npersons of some standing in the colony. Certainly the opportunity was\r\ntheirs. It will be interesting therefore to study the early records in\r\norder to glean what evidence we may concerning this matter. If the\r\nservants graduated in any appreciable numbers into the planter class,\r\nthe patents, wills, inventories, land transfers and muster rolls could\r\nhardly fail to yield some evidence of the fact.\r\n\r\nTurning first to the earliest period, we find that of the laborers who\r\nwere imported by the London Company to cultivate the public lands, a\r\nfair proportion became proprietors and were regarded by later comers\r\nwith especial esteem as \"ancient planters.\" At the termination of their\r\nservice they were granted 100 acres and when this was fully cultivated\r\nreceived another tract of the same extent. To the apprentices bound out\r\nto tenants even more liberal treatment was accorded, for they were\r\nprovided with a year's store of corn, a house, a cow, clothing, armor,\r\nhousehold utensils, farm tools and as much land as they could\r\ntill.[4-45]\r\n\r\nThe guiding hand of the Company was missed by the freedmen after the\r\nrevoking of the charter, for the Governors seem to have left them to\r\nshift for themselves. Yet this fact did not prevent many from forging\r\nahead, acquiring land, and in some cases positions of trust in the\r\nGovernment itself. In Hotten's _Immigrants_ is published a muster roll\r\nfor the year 1624 of all the settlers in Virginia, in which servants are\r\ncarefully distinguished from freemen.[4-46] By following, as well as the\r\nimperfect records of the period permit, the after careers of the former,\r\nit is possible to determine with a fair degree of accuracy to what\r\nextent the small farmer class at this period was recruited from persons\r\ncoming to the colony under terms of indenture.\r\n\r\nOf the forty-four Burgesses who sat in the Assembly of 1629, no less\r\nthan seven--John Harris, William Allen, William Popleton, Anthony\r\nPagett, Richard Townsend, Adam Thoroughgood and Lionell Rowlston--were\r\nlisted as servants in the muster of 1624.[4-47] Thus some sixteen per\r\ncent of this important body, the Virginia House of Commons, at this time\r\nwas made up of men who five years previously had been working out their\r\npassage money. Among the thirty-nine members of the House of 1632, six\r\nappear as servants in the muster--Thomas Barnett, Adam Thoroughgood,\r\nLionell Rowlston, Thomas Crump, Roger Webster and Robert Scotchmon.\r\nWhether there were other members who came over under terms of indenture\r\nbut secured their freedom before 1624, we have no means of determining.\r\n\r\nThe author of _Virginia's Cure_, published in 1662, asserted that the\r\nBurgesses \"were usual such as went over as servants thither; and though\r\nby time, and industry, they may have obtained competent estates, yet by\r\nreason of their poor and mean condition, were unskilful in judging of a\r\ngood estate, either of church or Commonwealth.\"[4-48] This statement is\r\na gross exaggeration both as to the composition of the Burgesses and\r\ntheir abilities. Instances of the election of freedmen to the House,\r\nfairly frequent in the early years of the colony, became rarer as the\r\ncentury advanced and the field of selection widened. Yet in the Assembly\r\nof 1652, of the thirty-five members, eight or nine appear on the patent\r\nrolls as headrights brought over by others.[4-49] It is evident that\r\neven so late as the middle of the century the door of opportunity was\r\nstill open to the freedmen.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a complete census for the decades after 1624, it is\r\nvery difficult to determine what proportion of the servants listed in\r\nthe muster roll of that year subsequently became landowners. Some light\r\nis thrown on the matter by a search through the patent books. Here are\r\nfound a surprisingly large number of persons who in 1624 were servants.\r\nAmong these are Anthony Jones, John Sparkes, John Cooke, Roger Delk,\r\nJohn Trussell, William Woolritch, Pettyplace Cloyse, Edward Sparshott,\r\nWilliam Dawson, Richard Bell, Robert Browne, Nicholas Browne, John\r\nChandler, Lionell Rowlston, Thomas Savadge, Samuel Bennett, Daniel\r\nShurley, James Hatfield, Adam Thoroughgood, John Robinson, John Hill,\r\nJohn Seaward, William Ramshaw, Samuel Weaver, John Upton, John Watson,\r\nThomas Crompe and John Russell.[4-50]\r\n\r\nOf these persons several acquired a fair degree of wealth and became of\r\nimportance in the early life of the colony. It is interesting to note\r\nalso, that some were men of good condition in England, the case of Adam\r\nThoroughgood, whose brother Sir John Thoroughgood was at one time\r\nsecretary to the Earl of Pembroke, is notable in this respect. John\r\nHill, before coming to Virginia, had been a book binder in Oxford\r\nuniversity, and his father had been a fletcher.[4-51] The patents of\r\nThomas Crompe and John Russell state that fifty acres was due in each\r\ncase for the \"personal adventure\" of the patentee, but since they are\r\ndistinctly listed as servants in 1624 it seems probable that\r\nsubsequently each made a visit to England and put in claims for the\r\nheadright for the return voyage.[4-52]\r\n\r\nThus it is evident that a large proportion of the landholders during and\r\nprior to 1635 had come to the colony under terms of indenture, either\r\nunder the Company or with private individuals. Perhaps it would not be\r\nunfair to estimate this proportion at from thirty to forty per cent, but\r\nit must be distinctly understood that the matter cannot be determined\r\nwith any degree of accuracy or finality. Some years later Governor\r\nBerkeley in an address before the Assembly, stated that hundreds of\r\nexamples testified to the fact that no man in Virginia was denied the\r\nopportunity to rise and to acquire both property and honor.[4-53]\r\nCareful research tends to corroborate this assertion but it does not and\r\ncannot show whether the bulk of the early planters came to the colony as\r\nfreemen or as indentured servants.\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1635 to 1660 the process of building up a class of\r\nsmall farmers in large part from freedmen continued unabated. But the\r\ndifficulties of the investigator in studying this period are also very\r\ngreat. Yet it is possible, by examining the names that appear in the\r\nland patents and wills, and comparing them with the list of headrights,\r\nto arrive at fairly satisfactory results. We find that of the 131\r\npersons listed in the York county wills from 1646 to 1659 no less than\r\ntwenty-five appear as headrights for others. Of these the major part\r\nbecame landowners, some of them men of influence in Virginia.[4-54] The\r\nRappahannock wills for the years from 1656 to 1664 show a like result.\r\nThirty-nine persons appear in the records, of whom seven came in as\r\nheadrights.[4-55]\r\n\r\nThere is always the possibility of error in identifying these persons\r\nfor the recurrence of such names as Smith, Jones, Turner, Davis, Hall,\r\nthe monotonous repetition of a few common given names, and the universal\r\nomission of middle names add greatly to our difficulties. Moreover,\r\nmistakes are apt to occur because of the transfer of headrights by sale.\r\nThe free immigrant to whom was due fifty acres for his \"personal\r\nadventure\" might not care to settle on the frontier where alone\r\nunpatented land could usually be found. At times he sold his right and\r\npurchased a plantation in some one of the older and more advanced\r\ncounties. It is not conclusively proved, then, that a certain person\r\ncame as a servant merely because he is listed as a headright. On the\r\nother hand, the fact that it was the custom to set forth such transfers\r\nclearly in the patent itself, justifies the conclusion that in the cases\r\nwhere no statement of the kind is made, the headright for which the land\r\nwas granted usually came in under terms of indenture.\r\n\r\nIn Volume III of the land patents are listed in the years from 1635 to\r\n1653 patents to fifty-seven persons in James City county.[4-56] Of these\r\nno less than thirty-one are found also as headrights belonging to\r\nothers, although a duplication of names in several cases makes\r\nidentification uncertain. One person only claimed the fifty acres for\r\nhaving paid his own passage to Virginia. When all possible allowance is\r\nmade for transfers of rights it is obvious that at this time freedmen\r\nwere still entering freely into the class of landowners.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the James City county patents in Volume IV, covering\r\nthe years from 1653 to 1663, leads to similar results, for of the\r\neighty-five names which appear there, forty-five are listed as\r\nheadrights belonging to others. And although the tracts granted these\r\nmen were usually small in size, in certain cases they were far in excess\r\nof the average plantation. Thus Edward Cole, who appears as a headright\r\nin 1642, patented 900 acres in 1655;[4-57] Thomas Warburton patented\r\n1,664 acres;[4-58] George Gilbert 1,000 acres; Francis Burwell 1,000 and\r\nJohn Underwood 2,000 acres.[4-59] The number of years which elapsed\r\nbetween the listing of the headrights and the granting of the patents\r\nvaried from two to twenty-eight. The average for the thirty-five cases\r\nin which the dates are given is twelve years. As the claims for\r\nheadrights were often made long after the actual arrival of the servant,\r\nit may be assumed that the average was even greater than this. Once\r\nmore, however, it must be remembered that these lists do not record\r\npersonal transfers of land, while it is quite certain that many\r\nfreedmen, instead of patenting unoccupied tracts, secured their little\r\nfarms by purchase. Some probably became proprietors in the very first\r\nyear of their freedom and set to work with hoe and plow to wrest their\r\nliving from the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the patent rolls the bulk of the headrights are alluded to simply as\r\n\"persons,\" leaving it undecided whether those included in the various\r\nlists are freemen or servants. But occasionally the newcomers are\r\nspecifically described as \"servants,\" in which case, of course, there\r\ncan be no doubt whatever as to their status. By selecting at random a\r\nnumber of names from those so termed, avoiding for convenience sake all\r\nSmiths, Joneses and others the frequent recurrence of whose names would\r\nmake identification difficult, it is possible to arrive at definite\r\nconclusions by following, as best we can, their careers in after life.\r\nWith this in view we have made up the following list of servants: Henry\r\nArnetrading, George Archer, Silvester Atkins, Nicholas Atwell, Edward\r\nAmes, John Aram, Robert Arnall, Peter Asheley, William Baldwin, Edward\r\nBurt, Francis Baile, John Bauchees, John Bishop, John Blackstone,\r\nAnthony Box, Michael Brichley, Peter Buck, William Burcher, John Causey,\r\nRobert Chesheire, Thomas Chilcott, Thomas Clayton, Annanias Coplestone,\r\nJames Courtney, Thomas Cropp, Thomas Connagrave, John Day, John Dodman,\r\nJonathan Ellison, Edward Eastwood, James Fletcher, Thomas Foanes, John\r\nFouke, Francis Francklin, Armstrong Foster, Robert Fossett, John Farr,\r\nRobert Garsell, George Gilbert, Henry Giles, Hector Godbear, Francis\r\nGray, Reginald Griffin, Thomas Halcock, Thomas Hand, Henry Hartwell,\r\nHugh Hayes, John Hedler, Richard Huett, John Hodgbins, John Holdin,\r\nWilliam Hankinson, John Hether, Lazarus Manning, Thomas Pattison, John\r\nPullapin, Sampson Robins, George Walton, Francis Withers, Robert Webstie\r\nand Thomas Warden. A search through the patent rolls, wills, tithable\r\nlists and other data found in the records of the period, has led to the\r\nmore or less positive identification of fifteen of these persons.\r\n\r\nJohn Bishop, who was transported by Thomas Gray, became a man of\r\ninfluence and means. He represented Charles City county in the House of\r\nBurgesses in the sessions of 1644, 1652 and 1653, and was variously\r\nknown as Captain Bishop or Mr. Bishop.[4-60] Although he became a\r\nlandowner so early as 1638,[4-61] his family arrived from England only\r\nin 1651. Francis Gray, brought to Virginia at the age of fifteen by\r\nJoseph Johnson, also became prominent, securing a seat in the Assembly\r\nand acquiring a fair estate. In 1653 he took up 750 acres in Charles\r\nCity county, while ten years later he is credited with 374 acres more in\r\nWestmoreland.[4-62] His will was recorded in 1667.[4-63]\r\n\r\nGeorge Archer became an extensive landowner, patenting 250 acres in\r\n1663, 550 acres in 1665, 784 acres in 1671 and 1,395 acres in\r\n1673.[4-64] In 1691 he received, in conjunction with others, title to a\r\ntract of 2,827 acres in Henrico.[4-65] John Holding patented in York\r\ncounty 850 acres in 1649 and 389 acres in 1653.[4-66] William Baldwin,\r\nwho came in the Plaine Joan when he was twenty-four years of age,\r\nreceived three grants of land, one for 600 acres in York county, one for\r\n67 acres in Isle of Wight, and one, in conjunction with Richard\r\nLawrence, for 300 in Rappahannock.[4-67]\r\n\r\nThomas Pattison, transported by Francis Epes in 1635, took up in\r\nLancaster two tracts, one for 200 acres and one for 400.[4-68] He also\r\nbecame part owner of two more tracts, one for 220 acres and the other\r\nfor 504.[4-69] John Dodman secured a patent for 350 acres in\r\nWestmoreland in the year 1662.[4-70] Thomas Warden is mentioned as a\r\nlandowner in James City county in 1643.[4-71] George Gilbert,\r\ntransported in 1635 by Joseph Johnson, took up fifty acres in James City\r\ncounty in 1643.[4-72] In 1663, in partnership with Richard Scruely, he\r\npatented 1,000 acres in the same county north of the Chickahominy\r\nriver.[4-73] John Blackstone acquired two tracts, one for 100 acres and\r\nthe other for 151 acres,[4-74] while William Burcher received a grant\r\nfor 300 acres.[4-75]\r\n\r\nSeveral of these men who came as servants to the Eastern Shore are found\r\nin succeeding years among the yeomanry of Accomac and Northampton. Henry\r\nArnetrading, Armstrong Foster, William Burcher and Sampson Robins were\r\nsigners of the Northampton submission to the Commonwealth in 1652.[4-76]\r\nHenry Arnetrading was the owner of 300 acres of land.[4-77] Armstrong\r\nFoster was the official tobacco viewer for Hungers, a position entailing\r\nno little responsibility.[4-78] Sampson Robins received a patent for a\r\ntract of land in Northampton in 1655.[4-79] Thomas Clayton is listed\r\namong the Northampton tithables of 1666.[4-80]\r\n\r\nIn the case of John Day some uncertainty arises. Apparently there were\r\ntwo men of this name in the colony, one transported by John Slaughter,\r\nand the other not only paying for his own passage, but for that of a\r\nservant as well.[4-81] A John Day later secured 400 acres in Gloucester\r\ncounty,[4-82] but whether it was the one who had come as a servant or\r\nthe one who had entered the colony as a freeman, apparently there is no\r\nway of ascertaining.\r\n\r\nAll in all the story of these men tends to confirm the conclusions\r\nhitherto arrived at. It must be remembered that the mortality among the\r\nservants in the tobacco fields in the early days of the colony was\r\nextremely heavy. It is not improbable that of our sixty-one servants,\r\ntwenty or more succumbed before the completion of their first year. That\r\nof the remaining forty-one, fourteen or fifteen established themselves\r\nas solid farmers, while several became men of influence in the colony,\r\nis a striking proof that at this period many freedmen had the\r\nopportunity to advance. Taking it for granted that the records of some\r\nof the sixty-one have been lost, or that our research has failed to\r\nreveal them, we once more come to the conclusion that a full thirty or\r\nforty per cent of the landowners of the period from 1635 to 1666 came to\r\nthe colony under terms of indenture.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is equally positive that the class of poor\r\nplanters was recruited in part from free immigrants, men who paid their\r\nown passage across the ocean and at once established themselves as\r\nfreeholders. Of this too, the records furnish ample testimony. Thus in\r\n1636 we find that Richard Young was granted 100 acres in Warwick \"due\r\nhim for his personal adventure and for the transportation of his wife\r\nDorothy Young.\"[4-83] A year later Roger Symonds received 100 acres in\r\nCharles City \"due him for the transportation of his wife, Alice, and one\r\nservant, Richard Key.\"[4-84] Similarly in May 1636, Thomas Wray was\r\nallowed 50 acres for his \"personal adventure.\" Such cases could be\r\nmultiplied indefinitely.[4-85]\r\n\r\nA careful analysis of the patent rolls from 1623 to July 14, 1637,\r\npublished in the _Virginia Magazine of History and Biography_ for April,\r\n1901, shows conclusively that the lists contain the names of many\r\npersons who at no time were under terms of indenture. Of the 2,675 names\r\nappearing in the records, the editor states that 336 are positively\r\nknown to have come over as freemen, many of them being heads of\r\nfamilies. \"There are 245 persons whose names do not occur as headrights\r\nand yet of whom it is not positively shown that they were freemen,\r\nthough the probability seems to be that by far the greater number were.\r\nAnd there were 2,094 persons whose transportation charges were paid by\r\nothers. This last number includes some negroes, all those specifically\r\ntermed 'servants' and all others.... It would probably be a fair\r\nestimate to say that of the names represented in the patents cited,\r\nthere were about 675 free men, women and children who came to Virginia\r\nand about 2000 servants and slaves.\"[4-86] Similarly in the issue of the\r\nmagazine for January, 1902, the editor says that \"for some years, about\r\nthis period, it is probable (from the best calculations which can be\r\nmade) that seventy-five per cent of the emigrants to Virginia were\r\nindentured servants.\"[4-87]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no reason to doubt the accuracy of these conclusions.\r\nCertainly any study of immigration to Virginia in the Seventeenth\r\ncentury is woefully incomplete if it fails to take into consideration\r\nthe very considerable proportion of free settlers. On the other hand,\r\nit is probable that a similar study of the lists for a later date would\r\nshow a smaller percentage of freemen. However this may be, it is evident\r\nthat by far the larger part of the newcomers at all periods must have\r\nbeen indentured servants intended for service in the tobacco fields. In\r\n1638 Richard Kemp wrote Secretary Windebanke that \"of hundreds which are\r\nyearly transported, scarce any but are brought in as merchandise to make\r\nsale of.\"[4-88]\r\n\r\nYet it must not be forgotten that any immigration of poor freemen,\r\nhowever small, would have a very marked influence upon the formation of\r\nthe small farmer class. Of the host of servants a certain proportion\r\nonly, a proportion probably less than fifty per cent, could hope even in\r\nthe most favorable times to become freeholders. If they survived the\r\nhardships and dangers of the service with their masters, it still\r\nremained for them to acquire property and win for themselves a place in\r\nthe life of the colony. And to accomplish this they must display\r\ndetermination, intelligence, industry and thrift, qualities by no means\r\nuniversal among the classes in England from which the servants were\r\nchiefly drawn. But for the free immigrant there need be no period of\r\nprobation. He might at once purchase his farm, erect his home, secure\r\nall necessary tools and put out his crop of tobacco. And whereas the\r\nservant usually found it possible to maintain a family only after many\r\nyears of hard work, perhaps not at all, the free settler often married\r\nbefore leaving England and brought his wife and children with him.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be said that in the first fifty years of the\r\ncolony's existence conditions were very favorable for the graduation of\r\nthe servant into the class of small freeholders, that the records amply\r\nprove that many succeeded in doing so, but that at this period a fair\r\nproportion of free immigrants also came to the colony. Before the\r\nexpiration of the Commonwealth period was formed from these two\r\nsources, perhaps in not unequal proportions, a vigorous, intelligent,\r\nindependent yeomanry, comprising fully 90 percent of all the\r\nlandowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER V_\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia hailed the Restoration with unaffected joy. Not\r\nonly did they anticipate that the termination of the long period of\r\ncivil war and unrest in England would react favorably upon their own\r\nprosperity, but they felt that Sir William Berkeley's well known loyalty\r\nand his action in proclaiming Charles II immediately after the execution\r\nof his father, might assure them the King's especial favor now that he\r\nat last had come into undisputed possession of his throne. They were\r\ndoomed to bitter disappointment, however, for the Restoration brought\r\nthem only hardship and suffering, discontent and rebellion.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the royal Government been safely installed than it set to\r\nwork to perfect and to enforce the colonial policy which in principle\r\nhad been accepted from the first. The ties which united the colonies\r\nwith the mother country were strengthened, those which gave them a\r\ncommon interest with foreign nations in so far as possible were snapped.\r\nThe British empire was to become a unit, closely knit by economic bonds\r\nand presenting to all other nations a hostile front. With this in view\r\nParliament passed a series of Navigation Acts, under which the trade of\r\nthe colonies was regulated for many years to come.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for us to enquire, therefore, into the effects of these\r\nlaws upon the tobacco trade, for tobacco, as we have seen, was the key\r\nto the prosperity of the colony, and favorable economic conditions alone\r\ncould make it possible for the newcomer to establish himself as a member\r\nof the Virginia yeomanry. If the strict enforcement of the Navigation\r\nActs should bring low prices for tobacco and wipe out the margin of\r\nprofit for the man who tilled the soil with his own hands, not only\r\nwould the small planter class not expand, but might actually decline in\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThere were three main features of the colonial legislation of Parliament\r\nduring this period, all of them interrelated and all tending toward the\r\none great object of keeping the English plantations for the English. It\r\nwas provided that the chief colonial products such as tobacco and sugar\r\nshould be sent only to England or to English colonies, that the colonies\r\nshould with few exceptions import goods only from British territory,\r\nthat all products taken to or from any colony should be conveyed only in\r\nEnglish vessels manned by crews composed mainly of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nIn committing itself to this policy the royal Government felt that the\r\nplantations would play a useful and necessary part in the great system\r\nwhich was planned, and in so doing would find prosperity. It had been\r\nthe hope of the English people that their colonies would produce the\r\narticles which were so badly needed by the mother country to revive her\r\nwaning industry and permit a greater measure of economic independence.\r\nAlthough more than half a century had passed since the first foothold\r\nhad been gained upon the American continent, this expectation was as far\r\nfrom realization as ever. The colonies, from Massachusetts to Barbados\r\nwere producing, not the articles which England especially needed, but\r\nthose for which they had the greatest natural aptitude, especially\r\ntobacco and sugar. And these staples they sent, not to England alone,\r\nbut to various foreign countries as well.\r\n\r\nIn short the vision of a closely knit, self-sustaining empire, the\r\nvision which had been in men's minds for many decades before the\r\nfounding of Jamestown, seemed to have proved delusive. The colonies\r\nwere developing interests and commercial connections hostile to those of\r\nthe mother country, were nourishing the manufactures and shipping of\r\nforeign nations almost as much as those of England. And this the\r\nGovernment at London would not tolerate. The colonial trade with\r\nstrangers must come to an end. If Virginia and Maryland produced more\r\ntobacco than the English market could absorb, they could find ready\r\nrelief by turning their energies into other channels. Let them furnish\r\nthe old country with pig iron or potash or silk or ship-stores and they\r\nwould find ready and eager purchasers. So reasoned the English, and as\r\ntheir views were backed by the mandates of Crown and Parliament, the\r\ncolonists were forced to submit. If they could fit themselves into the\r\nsystem prescribed for them, all would be well and good; if they found\r\nthis impossible, they would have to suffer without hope of redress.\r\n\r\nAnd suffer Virginia did for a full quarter of a century. The tobacco of\r\nthe Chesapeake bay colonies had long since reached the point where it\r\nrequired a world market. If confined to England alone, only a fraction\r\nof the output could be consumed and disaster was certain. It was well\r\nenough for the Government to restrict the importation of Spanish leaf\r\nand to prohibit the planting of tobacco in England, these regulations\r\ncould do no more than give the colonists undisputed possession of the\r\nhome market, and the home market was not enough. This point seems to\r\nhave been ignored by those writers who have contended that the strict\r\nenforcement of the British colonial system in itself entailed no\r\nhardship upon the tobacco colonies.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that any criticism of England's regulation of the\r\ncolonial tobacco trade, which is based on a laissez-faire social\r\nphilosophy,\" says George Lewis Beer, in _The Old Colonial System_, \"is\r\nequally applicable to the arrangement by means of which the tobacco\r\nplanter secured exclusive privileges in the home market.\"[5-1] Yet it is\r\ncertain that the tobacco growers of England could never have competed\r\nwith Maryland and Virginia had there been free trade. The prohibition of\r\nplanting in the old country was necessary only because of the tariff,\r\nvarying from 200 per cent in 1660 to 600 per cent in 1705, upon the\r\ncolonial product. And though the exclusion of Spanish tobacco was a more\r\nreal benefit, for the Spaniard produced varieties unknown in Virginia,\r\nthere is exaggeration here also. This is clearly shown by the fact that\r\nat the end of the Seventeenth century England was sending millions of\r\npounds of her colonial tobacco to Spain itself.[5-2] The leaf was\r\nbrought from Virginia and Maryland, forced to pay a duty of about fifty\r\nper cent, and re-exported to the Spanish ports, where it found a ready\r\nsale. Had there been free exchange of commodities, the English colonies\r\nwould have sold to Spain more tobacco than the Spanish colonies to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn truth the loss of the foreign market was a terrible disaster. In\r\nframing the Navigation Acts it was not the intention of the Government\r\nto stop entirely the flow of tobacco to the continent of Europe, but to\r\ndivert it from the old channels and make it pass through England. It was\r\ntherefore provided that in case the leaf was shipped out again to\r\nforeign ports, all the duties, except one half of the Old Subsidy,\r\nshould be withdrawn.[5-7] The remaining half penny, however, amounted to\r\nforty or fifty per cent of the original cost of the goods, and proved at\r\nfirst an almost insuperable barrier to the European trade. Moreover, the\r\nshortage of ships which resulted from the exclusion of the Dutch\r\nmerchants, the expense of putting in at the English ports, the long and\r\ntroublesome procedure of reshipping, all tended to discourage the\r\nmerchants and hamper re-exportation.\r\n\r\nWe may take for granted also that the resentment of Holland at the\r\nNavigation Acts, which struck a telling blow at her maritime prestige,\r\nplayed an important part in blocking foreign trade. The Dutch had been\r\nthe chief European distributors of the Virginia and Maryland tobacco,\r\nand if they refused to take it, now that it could be secured only in\r\nEngland, it would pile up uselessly in the London warehouses. They\r\nunderstood well enough that the half penny a pound duty was a tribute\r\nlevied upon them by their most dangerous rival. It is not surprising\r\nthat instead of bowing to the new restrictions, they sought to free\r\ntheir trade entirely from dependence on British tobacco, by fostering\r\nthe cultivation of the plant in their own country.\r\n\r\nThe colonists found an able defender in the merchant John Bland. In a\r\nRemonstrance addressed to the King this man set forth with remarkable\r\nclearness the evils which would result from the Navigation Acts, and\r\npleaded for their repeal. The Hollander was already beginning to plant\r\ntobacco, he said, and would soon be able to supply all his needs at\r\nhome. \"Will he, after accustomed to the tobacco of his own growth,\" he\r\nasked, \"ever regard that which is in Virginia? Will he ever afterwards\r\nbe induced to fetch it thence, when he finds his profit higher at home?\r\nWill he ever buy that of us, when by passing so many hands, and so much\r\ncharge contracted thereon, is made so dear, that he can have it cheaper\r\nin his own territories? (Surely no.) Therefore it clearly appears, that\r\nbeing so, of necessity we must lose that Trade and Commerce.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Hollanders must not trade to Virginia, how shall the Planters\r\ndispose of their Tobacco? The English will not buy it, for what the\r\nHollander carried thence was a sort of tobacco not desired by any other\r\npeople, nor used by us in England but merely to transport for Holland.\r\nWill it not then perish on the Planters hands?... Can it be believed\r\nthat from England more ships will be sent than are able to bring thence\r\nwhat tobacco England will spent? If they do bring more, must they not\r\nlose thereby both stock and Block, principle and charges? The tobacco\r\nwill not vend in England, the Hollanders will not fetch it from England;\r\nwhat must become thereof?... Is not this a destruction to the commerce?\r\nFor if men lose their Estates, certainly trade cannot be\r\nencreased.\"[5-8]\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the trade laws was indirectly the cause of still\r\nanother misfortune to the colonies, for the two wars with Holland which\r\ngrew out of it reacted disastrously upon their trade. In fact, on each\r\noccasion the small stream of tobacco which had trickled over the dam of\r\nrestrictions into foreign countries was for a time almost entirely cut\r\noff. Not only did the tobacco exports to Holland itself come to an end,\r\nbut the Dutch war vessels played havoc with the trade between England\r\nand other countries and even between England and her colonies.\r\n\r\nThe loss of their foreign exports was calamitous to the planters. Had\r\nthe demand for tobacco been more elastic, the consequences might not\r\nhave been so fatal, for declining prices would have stimulated\r\nconsumption and made it possible for England to absorb most of the\r\noutput. But the duty kept up the price and the result was a ruinous glut\r\nin the English market. Tobacco sufficient for a continent poured into\r\nthe kingdom, where since the normal outlet was blocked by the half penny\r\na pound on re-exported leaf, it piled up uselessly.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon prices was immediate. The planters were forced to take\r\nfor their crops half of what they had formerly received and had reason\r\nfor rejoicing if they could dispose of it at all. In 1662 Governor\r\nBerkeley and other leading citizens stated that the price of tobacco had\r\nfallen so low that it would not \"bear the charge of freight and customs,\r\nanswer the adventure, give encouragement to the traders and subsistence\r\nto the inhabitants.\"[5-9] In 1666 Secretary Thomas Ludwell told Lord\r\nArlington that tobacco was \"worth nothing.\"[5-10] Later in the same year\r\nthe planters complained that the price was so low that they were not\r\nable to live by it.[5-11] \"For the merchants, knowing both our\r\nnecessities and the unconsumable quantities of tobacco we had by us,\"\r\nthey said, \"gave us not the twentieth part of what they sold it for in\r\nEngland.\"[5-12] Tobacco had so glutted the markets, it was declared, and\r\nbrought the planter so small a return, that he could \"live but poorly\r\nupon it.\" In fact, the merchants in 1666 had left the greater part of\r\nthe two preceding crops upon their hands.[5-13]\r\n\r\n\"Twelve hundred pounds of tobacco is the medium of men's crops,\" wrote\r\nSecretary Ludwell to Lord John Berkeley in 1667, \"and half a penny per\r\npound is certainly the full medium of the price given for it, which is\r\nfifty shillings out of which when the taxes ... shall be deducted, is\r\nvery little to a poor man who hath perhaps a wife and children to cloath\r\nand other necessities to buy. Truly so much too little that I can\r\nattribute it to nothing but the great mercy of God ... that keeps them\r\nfrom mutiny and confusion.\"[5-14] The following year he wrote in similar\r\nvein. The market was glutted; a third of the planters' tobacco was left\r\non their hands; the rest sold for nothing.[5-15]\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Council declared that the merchant \"allows not much\r\nabove a farthing a pound for that which the planter brings to his door.\r\nAnd if there shall be any amongst us who shall be able to ship his\r\ntobacco on his own account, it will be at such a rate as the tobacco\r\nwill never repay him, since they are inforced to pay from £12 to £17 per\r\nton freight, which usually was but at seven pounds.\"[5-16] \"A large part\r\nof the people are so desperately poor,\" wrote Berkeley in 1673, \"that\r\nthey may reasonably be expected upon any small advantage of the enemy\r\nto revolt to them in hopes of bettering their condition by sharing the\r\nplunder of the colony with them.\"[5-17] That matters had not changed in\r\n1681 is attested by the statement of the Council that the impossibility\r\nof disposing of their tobacco without a heavy loss overwhelmed both\r\nVirginia and Maryland, and brought upon them a \"vast poverty and\r\ninfinite necessity.\"[5-18] \"The low price of tobacco staggers the\r\nimagination,\" Lord Culpeper wrote to Secretary Coventry, \"and the\r\ncontinuance of it will be the speedy and fatal ruin of this noble\r\nColony.\"[5-19]\r\n\r\nThese distressing conditions bore with telling weight upon the small\r\nplanters. The margin of profit which formerly had made it possible for\r\nthe freedman to advance rapidly was now wiped out entirely and the poor\r\nman found it impossible to keep out of debt. In 1668 Secretary Ludwell\r\ndeclared that no one could longer hope to better himself by planting\r\ntobacco.[5-20] Eight years later Nathaniel Bacon, in justifying his\r\nrebellion declared that the small farmers were deeply in debt and that\r\nit was \"not in the power of labor or industry\" to extricate them.[5-21]\r\n\"The poverty of Virginia is such,\" said a certain John Good in 1676,\r\n\"that the major part of the inhabitants can scarce supply their wants\r\nfrom hand to mouth, and many there are besides can hardly shift without\r\nsupply one year.\"[5-22] In 1673 the Governor and Council reported that\r\nof the planters, \"at least one third are single persons (whose labor\r\nwill hardly maintain them) or men much in debt,\" who might reasonably be\r\nexpected to revolt to the Dutch upon any small advantage gained by\r\nthem.[5-23] In 1680 they again reported that \"the indigency of the\r\nInhabitants is such that they are in noe manner capacitated to support\r\nthemselves.\"[5-24] Three years later they wrote that \"the people of\r\nVirginia are generally, some few excepted, extremely poor, not being\r\nable to provide against the pressing necessities of their\r\nfamilies.\"[5-25]\r\n\r\nDespite this repeated and explicit testimony of the misery and poverty\r\nof the colony during this period, which resulted from the stagnation of\r\nthe tobacco market after the passage of the Navigation Acts, the\r\nsurprising statement is made by Mr. George Lewis Beer, in _The Old\r\nColonial System_, that England's trade restrictions had nothing to do\r\nwith Bacon's Rebellion. \"It has been at various times contended,\" he\r\nsays, \"that the uprising was, in part at least, one against the laws of\r\ntrade and navigation. If there had existed in Virginia any widespread\r\nand well defined feeling of antagonism to these laws, it would\r\nunquestionably have found expression in the county grievances. Most of\r\nthese reports were drawn up in a number of articles, and in all there\r\nwere nearly two hundred of such separate subdivisions, yet only three of\r\nthis number refer in any way to these statutes. There is no valid reason\r\nfor assuming that the commercial system played any part whatsoever, or\r\nwas in any degree, an issue, in the upheaval of 1676.\"[5-26]\r\n\r\nIf by this statement it is meant that Bacon and his men did not rebel in\r\norder to force the repeal of the Navigation Acts, or even that they did\r\nnot have the acts in mind at the time, there are many students of\r\nVirginia history who will agree with it. But if Mr. Beer means that\r\nthese laws, with their baleful effect upon the prosperity of Virginia,\r\ndid not produce the conditions fundamental to the rising, he is\r\ncertainly wrong. The evidence is overwhelming.\r\n\r\nSurely no one will deny that misery, poverty and nakedness are breeders\r\nof sedition. Had it not been for the Navigation Acts there would not\r\nhave been so many desperate persons in Virginia ready at any excuse to\r\nfly in the face of the Government. Bacon's men were just the type of\r\nmiserably poor freemen that Berkeley several years before had feared\r\nwould rebel. He himself, in his proclamation of Feb. 10, 1677, spoke of\r\nthem as \"men of mean and desperate fortunes.\"[5-27] William Sherwood\r\ncalled the rebels rude and indigent persons, alluding to them as \"tag,\r\nrag and bobtayle.\"[5-28] Over and over again they are described as the\r\nmultitude, the rabble, the skum.\r\n\r\nException must be taken also to the statement that had there existed in\r\nVirginia any well-defined feeling of antagonism to the Navigation Acts\r\nit would have found expression in the county grievances. It should be\r\nremembered that these reports had been called for by the commissioners\r\nsent over by Charles II to investigate the troubles. The men who drew\r\nthem up occupied the position of defeated rebels, and the grievances\r\nwere primarily a list of excuses for their treason. They all stood\r\ntrembling for their property, if they had any, and for their miserable\r\nlives. The memory of the fate of Drummond and Bland and Arnold and many\r\nothers of their fellow rebels was fresh in their minds. It is not\r\nreasonable to suppose that they would tell the King that they had risen\r\nin arms against his authority in order to secure the overthrow of laws\r\nwhich his Majesty considered of such vital importance, laws which\r\nconcerned intimately the royal revenue. Such a declaration would not\r\nhave seconded successfully their plea for mercy. This is made amply\r\nclear by the reception accorded one of the few complaints which did\r\nactually touch the Navigation Acts. The commissioners report it to the\r\nKing as \"an extravagant request for liberty to transport their tobacco\r\nto any of his Majesty's plantations without paying the imposts, payable\r\nby act of Parliament, etc. This head is wholly mutinous--to desire a\r\nthing contrary to his Majesty's royal pleasure and benefit and also\r\nagainst an act of Parliament.\"[5-29]\r\n\r\nDespite the obviously ruinous effects of the Navigation Acts upon\r\nVirginia, Mr. Beer makes the assertion that there was no very serious\r\nand general opposition to them in Virginia. \"Apart from the criticisms\r\nof Bland and Berkeley,\" he says, \"there was virtually no complaint\r\nagainst the system of trade enjoined by the Navigation Acts. While the\r\nBarbados Assembly and that colony's governors were vociferous in their\r\nprotests, the Virginia legislature remained strangely mute.\"[5-30]\r\n\r\nThis silence on the part of the Virginia Assembly can by no means be\r\ninterpreted as an indication that the people of the colony felt the\r\nNavigation Acts to be equitable and not injurious to their interests. It\r\nmeant only that no Assembly under Sir William Berkeley would dare\r\nprotest against an act which had received the royal sanction. That would\r\nhave seemed the veriest treason to the fiery old loyalist. And the\r\nAssembly was entirely under Sir William's control. The members of both\r\nHouses were his creatures and his henchmen. Over and over again it is\r\ntestified that the Assembly did nothing more than register his\r\nwill.[5-31] If then it did not protest, it was because Sir William did\r\nnot wish it to protest.\r\n\r\nBut this does not prove that the planters were not angered and alarmed\r\nat the stringent acts. That they considered them baleful is amply proved\r\nby their continuous complaints of the economic ruin which had overtaken\r\nthe colony. The method they chose of combatting the trade laws, a method\r\napt to be far more effective than the angry protests of the Barbados\r\nAssembly, was to send the Governor to England to use his influence at\r\nCourt to have the acts modified or repealed. And Berkeley did what he\r\ncould. While in England he wrote a paper called _A Discourse and View of\r\nVirginia_, which he hoped would induce the Government to change its\r\npolicy in regard to the colonies. \"Wee cannot but resent,\" he said,\r\n\"that 40,000 people should be impoverished to enrich little more than 40\r\nmerchants, who being the whole buyers of our tobacco, give us what they\r\nplease for it. And after it is here sell as they please, and indeed have\r\n40,000 servants in us at cheaper rates, than other men have slaves, for\r\nthey find them meat and drink and clothes. We furnish ourselves and\r\ntheir seamen with meat and drink, and all our sweat and labor as they\r\norder us, will hardly procure us coarse clothes to keep us from the\r\nextremities of heat and cold.\"[5-32] That Sir William was but the\r\nmouthpiece of the colony in this protest there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nBut his pleadings were in vain. England would not change the laws which\r\nwere the expression of her settled colonial policy. The planters must\r\nadjust themselves to changed conditions no matter how bitter was the\r\nexperience. Sir William was told to go home to report to the Virginians\r\nthat they need not kick against the pricks, but that England would be\r\nmost pleased could they turn from the all-absorbing culture of tobacco\r\nto the production of the raw materials she so greatly desired. And\r\nBerkeley did return determined to exert every effort to lead the\r\ncolonists into new prosperity by inducing them to devote a part of their\r\nenergies to basic commodities. In fact he promised that in seven years\r\nhe would flood the British market with new Virginia goods.[5-33]\r\n\r\nAlthough he set to work with his accustomed vigor to make good this\r\nboast, he met with but scant success. Lack of efficient and skilled\r\nlabor, high wages, and not very favorable natural conditions, made it\r\nimpossible for him to compete with the long-established industries of\r\nEurope. After a few years all attempts to make silk and potash and naval\r\nstores were abandoned, and the planters continued to put their trust in\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThat Berkeley was never persuaded that the Navigation Acts were just or\r\nbeneficial is shown by his answer to the query of the Lords of Trade in\r\n1671, when they asked him what impediments there were to the colony's\r\ntrade. \"Mighty and destructive,\" he replied, \"by that severe act of\r\nParliament which excludes us from having any commerce with any nation\r\nin Europe but our own, so that we cannot add to our plantation any\r\ncommodity that grows out of it ... for it is not lawful for us to carry\r\na pipe-staff or a bushel of corn to any place in Europe out of the\r\nKing's dominions. If this were for his Majesty's service or the good of\r\nhis subjects we should not repine, whatever our sufferings are for it.\r\nBut on my soul it is the contrary of both.\"[5-35]\r\n\r\nNor is this the only direct testimony that the colonists were filled\r\nwith bitterness against the Navigation Acts. In 1673, during the war\r\nwith Holland, Sir John Knight declared that \"the planters there do\r\ngenerally desire a trade with the Dutch and all other nations, and speak\r\nopenly there that they are in the nature of slaves, so that the hearts\r\nof the greatest part of them are taken away from his Majesty and\r\nconsequently his Majesty's best, greatest and richest plantation is in\r\ndanger, with the planters' consent, to fall into the enemy's hands, if\r\nnot timely prevented.\"[5-36] This is corroborated by the Council itself,\r\nin an official letter to the King. \"For in this very conjuncture had the\r\npeople had a distasteful Governor,\" they wrote, \"they would have\r\nhazarded the loss of this Country, and the rather because they doe\r\nbelieve their Condicon would not be soe bad under the Dutch in Point of\r\nTraffique as it is under the Merchants who now use them hardly, even to\r\nextremity.\"[5-37]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that throughout the entire reign of Charles II the\r\nunhappy effects of the trade restrictions made of Virginia, which\r\nformerly had been the land of opportunity for the poor man, a place of\r\nsuffering, poverty and discontent. The indentured servant who came over\r\nafter 1660 found conditions in the colony hardly more favorable for his\r\nadvancement than in England. The price of tobacco was now so low that it\r\nwas not possible for a man, by his unassisted efforts, to make a profit\r\nby its cultivation. If Thomas Ludewell is correct in estimating the\r\nreturn from the average crop at fifty shillings, the lot of the poor\r\nman must have been hard indeed. Hungry he need not be, for food\r\ncontinued to be abundant and easy to obtain, but of all that the\r\nmerchants gave him in return for his tobacco--clothing, farm implements,\r\nhousehold furnishings--he had to content himself with the scantiest\r\nsupply. And only too often his pressing needs brought him into hopeless\r\ndebt. As for imitating his predecessors of the earlier period in saving\r\nmoney, purchasing land and servants and becoming a substantial citizen,\r\nthe task was well nigh impossible of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIt would be expected, then, that even the most exhaustive investigation\r\ncould reveal but a few indentured servants, coming over after 1660, who\r\nsucceeded in establishing themselves in the Virginia yeomanry. And such,\r\nindeed, is the case. Fortunately we have at hand for the period in\r\nquestion the means of determining this matter with an exactness\r\nimpossible for the first half of the century. Nicholson's rent roll of\r\n1704 supplies a complete list, with the exception of those in the\r\nNorthern Neck, of every landowner in Virginia. At the same time we have\r\nin the Land Office at Richmond, the names of many thousands of persons\r\nlisted as headrights, constituting almost all the immigrants who came in\r\nduring the years from 1666 to the end of the century. Thus by comparing\r\nthe two lists and trying to identify on the rent roll the names found in\r\nthe patents, it is possible to fix the proportion of servants who won\r\nfor themselves at this time places among the landowning class.\r\n\r\nSelecting the year 1672 as typical of the Restoration period, we find\r\nthat an examination of 672 of the names which are listed as headrights,\r\neleven only can be identified with any degree of certainty upon the rent\r\nroll. Of 1116 names examined in the years from 1671 to 1674 inclusive,\r\nonly 26 are positively those of persons listed as landowners in 1704.\r\nAfter making due allowance for the fact that uncertainty exists in a\r\nnumber of other cases, and that some who prospered must have died in the\r\nintervening years, it is safe to say that not more than five or six per\r\ncent of the indentured servants of this period succeeded in establishing\r\nthemselves as independent planters.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are borne out by the slowness with which the\r\npopulation increased during the years following the passage of the\r\nNavigation Acts. In the Commonwealth period the colony had advanced by\r\nleaps and bounds, and the inhabitants, estimated at 15,000 in\r\n1649,[5-38] were placed by Berkeley thirteen years later at\r\n40,000.[5-39] Under the system which existed during these years, when\r\nthe colonists enjoyed a comparatively free trade, the population had\r\ntripled. But after 1660, while the Virginia tobacco was dumped upon the\r\nrestricted English market and prices fell lower and lower, no such rapid\r\ngrowth is noted. In 1671, nine years after his first estimate, Governor\r\nBerkeley still placed the population at 40,000.[5-40] And even if we\r\naccept the statement of the Virginia agents sent to England to secure a\r\ncharter for the colony that in 1675 the number of inhabitants was\r\n50,000, it is evident that some pernicious influence was at work to\r\nretard the development of England's most important American\r\nprovince.[5-41] A drop in the rate of increase from 200 per cent during\r\nthe thirteen years prior to 1662, to 25 per cent in the thirteen years\r\nfollowing, is a clear index to the startling change brought about in the\r\ncolony by the British trade regulations.\r\n\r\nThese figures are the more significant in that there was no appreciable\r\nslackening of the stream of servants. It is probable that in the period\r\nfrom 1662 to 1675, which marked this estimated increase of 10,000\r\npersons, fully 20,000 immigrants had come to the colony.[5-42] The\r\npatent rolls for 1674 alone give the names of 1931 headrights, and this\r\nyear is by no means exceptional. No wonder Edward Randolph was\r\nsurprised at the smallness of the population and wrote to the Board of\r\nTrade that it should be investigated why Virginia had not grown more,\r\n\"considering what vast numbers of servants and others had been\r\ntransported thither.\"[5-43]\r\n\r\nBut Randolph failed to realize that it is not the volume of immigration\r\nbut the number of people a country will support which in the end\r\ndetermines the size of the population. It was not enough to pour into\r\nthe colony tens of thousands of poor settlers; opportunity had also to\r\nbe afforded them for earning an adequate living. And this opportunity,\r\nbecause of the enforcement of the Navigation Acts and the consequent\r\nruin of trade, they did not have in Virginia. Throughout the Restoration\r\nperiod not more than forty or fifty thousand people could exist upon the\r\nreturns from the tobacco crop, and beyond that the population could\r\nhardly rise. If more poured in, they must of necessity live in misery\r\nand rags, or migrate to other colonies where more favorable conditions\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nWe are not at present concerned with what become of this surplus\r\npopulation, but only with the fact that the Navigation Acts brought to a\r\ndead halt the process of moulding freedmen and other poor settlers into\r\na prosperous yeomanry. By the year 1660 this class seems to have reached\r\nits highest development, and had a rent roll of land owners been drawn\r\nup at that date it would doubtless have shown almost as many names as\r\nthat of 1704. In fact it is fortunate that in the bitter years from 1660\r\nto 1685 it did not succumb entirely. With the price of tobacco so low\r\nthat no profit was to be derived from it, with his family in rags, the\r\nsmall planter might well have sold his land to his more wealthy neighbor\r\nand joined the newly freed servants in moving on to western Carolina or\r\nto the northern colonies.\r\n\r\nIn fact it is an indication of the solid character of the Virginia\r\nyeomanry that it survived to enter the Eighteenth century, that under\r\nAndros and Nicholson as well as under Sir William Berkeley it was the\r\nsoundest element in the life of the colony. Had it not been for the\r\ncrowning misfortune of the introduction of great swarms of negro slaves,\r\nsooner or later it would have come once more into its own, would have\r\ncarved out for itself a new prosperity, would have filled Virginia from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VI_\r\n\r\nTHE YEOMAN IN VIRGINIA HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would have been impossible for the Virginia yeoman to survive\r\nthe dark days of the Restoration period had it not been for the fact\r\nthat in the matter of his food supply he was independent of England and\r\nher vexatious trade restrictions. He might be in rags, but there was no\r\nreason why he should ever feel the pangs of hunger. Seldom in any\r\nclimate, in any age has food existed in such extraordinary variety and\r\nin such lavish abundance.\r\n\r\nAlmost every planter, even the poorest, was possessed of cattle. The\r\n_Perfect Discription_ states that in 1649 there were in the colony \"of\r\nKine, Oxen, Bulls, Calves, twenty thousand, large and good.\"[6-1]\r\nFifteen years later the number had increased to 100,000.[6-2] Many a\r\nlittle farmer, too poor to afford the help of a servant or a slave, had\r\ncattle more than sufficient for his every need. John Splitimber, a\r\nplanter of meagre means, died in 1677 owning eight cows and one\r\nbull.[6-3] John Gray, whose entire personal estate was valued only at\r\n9,340 pounds of tobacco, possessed at his death six cows, six calves,\r\ntwo steers and one heifer.[6-4] The inventory of the goods of Richard\r\nAvery, another poor planter, shows three steers, one heifer, three small\r\ncattle and one calf.[6-5] The yeoman not only secured from these animals\r\na goodly supply of beef, but milk in abundance from which he made butter\r\nand cheese. The steers he used as beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nThe meat which most frequently appeared upon the table of the poor man\r\nwas that of swine. The planter marked his hogs and turned them loose in\r\nthe woods to feed upon roots and acorns. On the other hand, sheep did\r\nnot multiply in the colony, for the woods were not suited for their\r\nmaintenance, and those areas which had been cleared of trees could more\r\nprofitably be utilized for agriculture than for pasture lands. Mutton\r\nwas a rare delicacy even with the well-to-do.[6-6]\r\n\r\nPoultry were exceedingly numerous. At the time of the Company it was\r\nstated that the planter who failed to breed one hundred a year was\r\nconsidered a poor manager. The _Perfect Discription_ says that the\r\npoultry--\"Hens, Turkies, Ducks, Geece\"--were without number.[6-7]\r\nMoreover, the wild fowls of the inland waterways were so numerous that\r\neven the least skilful of huntsmen could readily bring down enough for\r\nthe needs of his family, and the mallard, the goose, the canvasback\r\nappeared regularly in season upon every table.[6-8]\r\n\r\nThe planter always devoted a part of his land to the production of the\r\ngrain which was needed for his personal requirements. \"They yearly plow\r\nand sow many hundred acres of Wheat,\" it was said, \"as good and faire as\r\nany in the world.\"[6-9] At the same time maize grew so readily and its\r\ncultivation proved so cheap, that cornbread formed a part of the diet\r\nnot only of the planters themselves, but of their servants and slaves.\r\n\r\nFrom his garden, an inevitable accompaniment of every plantation, the\r\nfarmer secured a large variety of vegetables--potatoes, asparagus,\r\ncarrots, turnips, onions, parsnips, besides such fruits as strawberries,\r\ngooseberries, raspberries; from his orchard he had apples, pears,\r\nquinces, apricots, peaches.[6-10] Honey was abundant, and there were few\r\nhouseholders who did not have hives under the eaves of their\r\noutbuildings. One planter, a Mr. George Pelton, is said to have made a\r\nprofit of £30 from his bees.[6-11] There were also many wild swarms in\r\nthe woods, which yielded a delicious return to the colonial\r\nbee-hunters.[6-12]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, then, why there were no complaints of hunger\r\neven in the days when poverty was almost universal. The Virginia yeoman\r\nspread always an abundant table. \"He that is lazy and will not work,\"\r\nsaid the author of _New Albion_, \"needs not fear starving, but may live\r\nas an Indian, sometimes Oysters, Cockles, Wilkes, Clams, Scollons two\r\nmoneths together; sometimes wilde Pease and Vetches, and Long Oates,\r\nsometimes Tuckaho, Cuttenoman ground, Nuts, Marhonions, sometimes small\r\nnuts, Filbirds, Wallnuts, Pokeberries, ten sorts of Berries, Egs of\r\nFoul, small Fish in Coves at low water will teach him to live idly.\" \"It\r\nmust needs follow then that diet cannot be scarce, since both rivers and\r\nwoods afford it, and that such plenty of Cattle and Hogs are every\r\nwhere, which yield beef, veal, milk, butter, cheese and other made\r\ndishes, porke, bacon and pigs, and that as sweet and savoury meat as the\r\nworld affords, these with the help of Orchards and Gardens, Oysters,\r\nFish, Fowle and Venison, certainly cannot but be sufficient for a good\r\ndiet and wholsom accommodation, considering how plentifully they are,\r\nand how easie with industry to be had.\"[6-13]\r\n\r\nBut the little planter, with the advent of the Navigation Acts, often\r\nsuffered keenly from a lack of adequate clothing. Again and again the\r\nletters of the period state that the poor man was reduced to rags, that\r\nhe could not protect his family from the winter's cold. There was some\r\nmanufacture of cloth in the home, but the planter usually trusted to the\r\nforeign trader to bring him every article of clothing. He had neither\r\nthe implements nor the skill to supply his own needs. During the\r\nRestoration period, and again at the time of the war of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, when the price of tobacco fell so very low, many families\r\nsucceeded in producing enough homespun to supply their most pressing\r\nneeds.[6-14] But with the return of better conditions they laid aside\r\nthe loom and the wheel, and resumed their purchase of English cloth.\r\n\r\nIn normal times the poor planter was comfortably clad. Edward Williams,\r\nin _Virginia Richly Valued_, advised every new immigrant to bring a\r\nmonmouth cap, a waistcoat, a suit of canvas, with bands, shirts,\r\nstockings and shoes.[6-15] The author of _New Albion_ thought that each\r\nadventurer should provide himself with canvas or linen clothes, with\r\nshoes and a hat.[6-16]\r\n\r\nThe houses of the small planters were small but comfortable. \"Pleasant\r\nin their building,\" says John Hammond, \"which although for most part\r\nthey are but one story besides the loft, and built of wood, yet\r\ncontrived so delightfully that your ordinary houses in England are not\r\nso handsome, for usually the rooms are large, daubed and whitelimed,\r\nglazed and flowered, and if not glazed windows, shutters which are made\r\nvery pritty and convenient.\"[6-17] _The New Description of Virginia_,\r\npublished in 1649, says: \"They have Lime in abundance for their houses,\r\nstore of bricks made, and House and Chimnies built of Brick, and some of\r\nWood high and fair, covered with Shingell for Tyle.\"[6-18]\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Company most of the houses seem to have been made of\r\nlogs, and Butler, in his _Virginia Unmasked_, declared that they were\r\nthe \"worst in the world,\" and that the most wretched cottages in England\r\nwere superior to them.[6-19] But the period of which Butler wrote was\r\nexceptional, and before long the growing prosperity of the colony made\r\npossible a great improvement in the dwellings of the people. The rough\r\nlog cabin gave way to the little framed cottage with chimneys at each\r\nend.\r\n\r\nA residence erected in one of the parishes of the Eastern Shore in 1635\r\nto serve as a parsonage may be accepted as typical of the better class\r\nof houses in Virginia at this time. It was made of wood, was forty feet\r\nwide, eighteen deep and had a chimney at each end. On either side was an\r\nadditional apartment, one used as a study, the other as a\r\nbuttery.[6-20] For the poor man this was far too pretentious, and he had\r\nto content himself with a home perhaps thirty by twenty feet, containing\r\nat times two or three apartments, at times only one.\r\n\r\nBut such as it was it gave him ample protection against the heat of\r\nsummer and the cold of winter. Fuel he never lacked. When the frosts of\r\nDecember and January came upon him, he had only to repair to the nearest\r\nforest, axe in hand, to supply himself with wood in abundance. In this\r\nway, not only would he keep a roaring blaze in his open fireplace, but\r\nwould widen the space available for the next summer's tobacco crop.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of the planter's residence were severely plain. In the\r\nyard, which usually was uninclosed, towered a cluster of trees, a\r\nsurvival of the primeval forest. Nearby was the garden, with its flowers\r\nand vegetables, the dove-cote, the barn, the hen house, perhaps a milk\r\nhouse or even a detached kitchen. In some cases wells were sunk, but the\r\nuse of natural springs was more common.[6-21]\r\n\r\nOf the plantation itself, only a fraction was under cultivation at one\r\ntime. Tobacco was exceedingly exhausting to the soil, but the cheapness\r\nof land led the planters to neglect the most ordinary precautions to\r\npreserve its fertility. They sowed year after year upon the same spot,\r\nuntil the diminishing yield warned them of approaching sterility, and\r\nthen would desert it to clear a new field. This system made it necessary\r\nfor them to provide for the future by securing farms far larger in\r\nextent than was dictated by their immediate requirements. They had to\r\nlook forward to the day when their land would become useless, and if\r\nthey were provident, would purchase ten times more than they could\r\ncultivate at any one time. Thomas Whitlock, in his will dated 1659,\r\nsays: \"I give to my son Thomas Whitlock the land I live on, 600 acres,\r\nwhen he is of the age 21, and during his minority to my wife. The land\r\nnot to be further made use of or by planting or seating than the first\r\ndeep branch that is commonly rid over, that my son may have some fresh\r\nland when he attains to age.\"[6-22]\r\n\r\nOne may gain an idea of the condition of the very poorest class of\r\nfreemen by an examination of the inventory of the estate of Walter\r\nDorch, drawn up in 1684. This man possessed two pairs of woollen cards,\r\nand one spinning wheel, valued at 100 pounds of tobacco, one chest at\r\neighty pounds, four old trays at twenty pounds, two runletts at forty\r\npounds, one pail and one skillet at sixty pounds, one bowl at two\r\npounds, one feather bed, two pillows and three old blankets at 120\r\npounds of tobacco, three glass bottles at twenty pounds, one couch frame\r\nat forty pounds, one pair of pot-hooks at forty, 800 tenpenny nails at\r\nforty-five, and one old table and one sifter at twenty pounds. In all\r\nthe estate was valued at 587 pounds of tobacco.[6-23]\r\n\r\nJohn Gray, who died in 1685, left personal property worth 9,340 pounds\r\nof tobacco, consisting in part of six cows and six calves, four\r\nyearlings, two steers, one heifer, one barrel of corn, one bull, ten\r\nhogs and one horse. He had no servants and no slaves.[6-24] In better\r\ncircumstances was Richard Avery, who seems to have been a tanner by\r\nprofession. The inventory of his estate, recorded in 1686, includes one\r\nhorse with bridle and saddle, a cart and a yoke of steers, eight head of\r\ncattle, 25 hogs, 118 hides, various kinds of tools, lumber to the value\r\nof 400 pounds of tobacco, four pieces of earthenware, four beds with\r\nmattresses and covers, poultry to the value of 180 pounds of tobacco,\r\nsome wheat in the ground and a batch of wearing linen. The entire\r\npersonal estate was valued at 14,050 pounds of tobacco. It included no\r\nservants or slaves.[6-25]\r\n\r\nJohn Splitimber, who is entered as a headright to Thomas Harwood in\r\n1635, is typical of the planter who rose from small beginnings to a\r\nstate of comparative prosperity. This man, at his death in 1677,\r\npossessed eight cows, one bull, four yearlings, four mares, 35 hogs, two\r\nhorses, two bolsters, a pillow, two blankets, a mattress, two bedsteads,\r\ntwo guns, fifty-six pounds of pewter, two rugs, a table, three chests,\r\none old couch, two iron pots, two kettles, two stilyards, shovel and\r\ntongs, two smothering irons, two axes, a few carpenter's tools, a saddle\r\nand bridle, four casks, clothing to the value of 1,100 pounds of\r\ntobacco, a frying pan, a butter pat, a jar, a looking glass, two milk\r\npans, one table cloth, nine spoons, a churn, a bible. The appraisers\r\nplaced the total value at 18,277 pounds of tobacco.[6-26] The inventory\r\nrecords no servants or slaves, but it is probable that Splitimber at\r\ntimes made use of indentured labor, as in November 1648 and again in\r\n1652, we find him taking up land due for the transportation of certain\r\npersons to the colony.[6-27]\r\n\r\nOf similar estate was Christopher Pearson, of York county. His personal\r\nproperty included bedding valued at £7, linen at 18 shillings, pewter at\r\n£1.18.0, brass at six shillings, wooden ware at £4.13.6 comprising three\r\nchairs and one table, a couch, four old chests, a cask, two ten gallon\r\nrundletts, a cheese press, a box of drawers, an old table, three pails,\r\na spinning wheel with cards, two sifting trays, a corn barrel, three\r\nbedsteads, four sives, a funnel; iron ware valued at £2.12.0, including\r\nthree pots, two pot-rocks, a pestal, a frying pan, a looking glass;\r\nthree cows appraised at £6.5.0, a yearling at ten shillings, a colt at\r\ntwo pounds sterling. The entire estate was valued at £25.19.6.[6-28]\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined, however, that Virginia, even in the early years\r\nof its settlement, contained no men of wealth or rank. Industry and\r\nintelligence bore their inevitable fruit in the little colony, with the\r\nresult that here and there certain planters acquired an enviable\r\npre-eminence among their fellows. The _New Description_ mentions several\r\nsuch cases. Captain Matthews \"hath a fine house,\" it says, \"and all\r\nthings answerable to it; he sowes yeerly store of Hempe and Flax, and\r\ncauses it to be spun; he keeps Weavers, and hath a Tanhouse, causes\r\nLeather to be dressed, hath eight Shoemakers employed in their trade,\r\nhath forty Negro servants, brings them up to Trades in his house. He\r\nyeerly sowes abundance of Wheat, Barley, &c. The Wheat he selleth at\r\nfour shillings the bushell; kills store of Beeves, and sells them to\r\nvictuall the Ships when they come thither; hath abundance of Kine, a\r\nbrave Dairy, Swine great store, and Poltery; he married a Daughter of\r\nSir Thomas Hinton, and in a word, keeps a good house, lives bravely, and\r\na true lover of Virginia; he is worthy of much honor.\"[6-29]\r\n\r\nThis description is interesting because it shows not only the extent of\r\nthe holdings of certain planters at this early date, but that their\r\nprosperity had the same foundation as that of the more numerous class of\r\nwealthy men of the Eighteenth century. In both cases slavery and\r\nplantation manufacture would seem to have been the open sesame to\r\nsuccess. It is notable that of the very limited number of men in\r\nVirginia prior to 1700 who stand out above their fellows in the\r\nreadiness with which they acquired property, almost all gathered around\r\nthem a goodly number of negroes.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent planters of the first half of the Seventeenth\r\ncentury was George Menefie, famous for his orchard which abounded in\r\napple, pear and cherry trees, and for his garden which yielded all kinds\r\nof fruits, vegetables, and flowers; Richard Bennett, a man of large\r\nproperty who had in one year \"out of his Orchard as many Apples as he\r\nmade 20 Butts of Excellent Cider\"; Richard Kinsman, who for three or\r\nfour years in succession secured \"forty or fifty Butts of Perry made out\r\nof his Orchard, pure and good.\"[6-30]\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the century the class of the well-to-do, although\r\nsomewhat more numerous, was still restricted to a small group of\r\nprominent families, many of them connected by marriage. Among the best\r\nknown men are Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., Thomas Ballard, Robert Severely,\r\nGiles Brent, Joseph Bridger, William Byrd I, John Carter, John Custis I,\r\nDudley Digges, William Fitzhugh, Lewis Burwell, Philip Ludwell I,\r\nWilliam Moseley, Daniel Parke, Ralph Wormeley, Benjamin Harrison, Edward\r\nHill, Edmund Jennings and Matthew Page. But so few were their numbers\r\nthat the Governors more than once complained that they could not find\r\nmen for the Council of State qualified for that post by their wealth and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe depository of power for the Virginia yeomanry was the House of\r\nBurgesses. This important body was elected by the votes of the\r\nfreeholders, and faithfully represented their interests. Here they would\r\nbring their grievances, here express their wishes, here defend\r\nthemselves against injustice, here demand the enactment of legislation\r\nfavorable to their class. The hope of the people lay always in the\r\nBurgesses, Bacon the rebel tells us, \"as their Trusts, and Sanctuary to\r\nfly to.\"[6-31] And though the commons usually elected to this body the\r\nleading men of each county, men of education and wealth if such were to\r\nbe found, they held them to a strict accountability for their every\r\naction.[6-32] Many of the best known members of the Council of State\r\nserved their apprenticeship in the Burgesses. But whatever the social\r\nstatus of the Burgess, he felt always that he was the representative of\r\nthe poor planter, the defender of his interests, and seldom indeed did\r\nhe betray his trust.[6-33] This no doubt was with him in part a matter\r\nof honor, but it also was the result of a consciousness that unless he\r\nobeyed the behests of his constituency he would be defeated if he came\r\nup for re-election.\r\n\r\nThe House of Burgesses, even in the days when the colony was but an\r\ninfant settlement stretching along the banks of the James, did not\r\nhesitate to oppose the wishes of the King himself. In 1627 Charles I\r\nsent instructions for an election of Burgesses that he might gain the\r\nassent of the planters through their representatives to an offer which\r\nhe made to buy their tobacco.[6-34] Although the Assembly must have\r\nrealized that its very existence might depend upon its compliance with\r\nthe King's wishes, it refused to accept his proposal.[6-35] In 1634\r\nCharles again made an offer for the tobacco, but again he encountered\r\nstubborn opposition. The Secretary of the colony forwarded a report in\r\nwhich he frankly told the British Government that in his opinion the\r\nmatter would never go through if it depended upon the yielding of the\r\nAssembly.[6-36]\r\n\r\nIn 1635 the people again showed their independent spirit by ejecting Sir\r\nJohn Harvey from the Government and sending him back to England. It is\r\ntrue that the Council members took the lead in this bold step, but they\r\nwould hardly have gone to such lengths had they not been supported by\r\nthe mass of small planters.[6-37] In fact, one of the chief grievances\r\nagainst the Governor was his refusal to send to the King a petition of\r\nthe Burgesses, which he considered offensive because they had made it \"a\r\npopular business, by subscribing a multitude of hands thereto.\" And some\r\ndays before the actual expulsion Dr. John Pott, Harvey's chief enemy,\r\nwas going from plantation to plantation, inciting the people to\r\nresistance and securing their signatures to a paper demanding a redress\r\nof grievances.[6-38]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the small planters during the English civil war and\r\nCommonwealth period is equally instructive. Certain writers have\r\nmaintained that the people of Virginia were a unit for the King, that\r\nupon the execution of Charles I his son was proclaimed with the\r\nunanimous consent of the planters, that the colony became a refuge for\r\nEnglish cavaliers, that it surrendered to Parliament only when\r\nconquered by an armed expedition and that it restored Charles II as King\r\nof Virginia even before he had regained his power in England.\r\n\r\nAll of this is either misleading or entirely false. It is true that the\r\nAssembly proclaimed Charles II King in 1649 and passed laws making it\r\nhigh treason for any person to uphold the legality of the dethronement\r\nand execution of his father.[6-39] But this was largely the work of Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley and the small group of well-to-do men who were\r\ndependent upon him for their welfare. The very fact that it was felt\r\nnecessary to threaten with dire punishment all who spread abroad reports\r\n\"tending to a change of government,\" shows that there existed a fear\r\nthat such a change might be effected.[6-40] How many of the small\r\nplanters were at heart friendly to Parliament it is impossible to say,\r\nbut the number was large enough to cause Sir William Berkeley such\r\nserious misgivings as to his own personal safety that he obtained from\r\nthe Assembly a guard of ten men to protect him from assassination.[6-41]\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that Virginia was forced into an unwilling submission\r\nto Parliament. It is true that an expedition was sent to conquer the\r\ncolony, which entered the capes, sailed up to the forts at Jamestown and\r\nthere received the formal surrender of the colony.[6-42] But this\r\nsurrender was forced upon the Governor as much by the wishes of the\r\npeople as by the guns of the British fleet. In fact, the expedition had\r\nbeen sent at the request of certain representatives of the Parliamentary\r\nfaction in Virginia, who made it clear to the Commonwealth leaders that\r\nthe colony was by no means unanimous for the King, and that it was held\r\nto its allegiance only by the authority and firm will of the\r\nGovernor.[6-43] That the British Council of State expected to receive\r\nactive assistance from their friends in Virginia is evident, for they\r\ngave directions for raising troops there and for appointing\r\nofficers.[6-44] And there can be no doubt that the imposing military\r\nforce which had been gathered to defend Jamestown was not called into\r\naction chiefly because Berkeley became convinced that it could not be\r\nrelied upon to fight against the Commonwealth soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe new regime which was introduced with the articles of surrender made\r\nof Virginia virtually a little republic. In England the long cherished\r\nhope of the patriots for self-government was disappointed by the\r\nusurpation of Oliver Cromwell. But the commons of Virginia reaped the\r\nreward which was denied their brothers of the old country. For a period\r\nof eight years all power resided in the House of Burgesses. This body,\r\nso truly representative of the small planter class, elected the Governor\r\nand specified his duties. If his administration proved unsatisfactory\r\nthey could remove him from office. The Burgesses also chose the members\r\nof the Council. Even the appointing of officials was largely theirs,\r\nalthough this function they usually felt it wise to delegate to the\r\nGovernor.[6-45] In fact, Virginia was governed during this period, the\r\nhappiest and most prosperous of its early history, by the small\r\nproprietor class which constituted the bulk of the population.\r\n\r\nNor is it true that the people voluntarily surrendered this power by\r\nacknowledging the authority of Charles II before the actual restoration\r\nin England. After the death of Cromwell, when the affairs of the mother\r\ncountry were in chaos and no man knew which faction would secure\r\npossession of the government, the Virginia Assembly asked Sir William\r\nBerkeley to act again as their chief executive. But it was specifically\r\nstipulated that he was to hold his authority, not from Charles, but from\r\nthemselves alone.[6-46] In this step the people were doubtless actuated\r\nby an apprehension that the monarchy might be restored, in which case it\r\nwould be much to their advantage to have as the chief executive of the\r\ncolony the former royal Governor; but they expressly stated that they\r\nheld themselves in readiness to acknowledge the authority of any\r\nGovernment, whatever it might be, which succeeded in establishing itself\r\nin England. So far was Sir William from considering himself a royal\r\nGovernor, that when the King actually regained his throne, he wrote with\r\nno little apprehension, begging forgiveness for having accepted a\r\ncommission from any other source than himself.[6-47]\r\n\r\nIt was the small farmer class which suffered most from the despotic\r\nmethods of Berkeley during the Restoration period--the corrupting of the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, the heavy taxes, the usurpation of power in local\r\ngovernment, the distribution of lucrative offices--and it was this class\r\nwhich rose in insurrection in 1676. It is notable that in the course of\r\nBacon's Rebellion the great mass of the people turned against the\r\nGovernor, either approving passively of his expulsion, or actually\r\naiding his enemies. When Sir William appealed for volunteers in\r\nGloucester county while Bacon was upon the Pamunkey expedition, he could\r\nhardly muster a man.[6-48] And the forces which eventually he gathered\r\naround him seem to have included only a handful of leading citizens,\r\nsuch men as Philip Ludwell, Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., Giles Brent and Robert\r\nBeverley, together with a mass of indentured servants and others who had\r\nbeen forced into service. It is this which explains the apparent\r\ncowardice of the loyal forces, who almost invariably took to their heels\r\nat the first approach of the rebels, for men will not risk their lives\r\nfor a cause in which their hearts are not enlisted.\r\n\r\nAnd though the small farmers lost their desperate fight, though their\r\nleaders died upon the scaffold, though the oppressive Navigation Acts\r\nremained in force, though taxes were heavier than ever, though the\r\ngovernors continued to encroach upon their liberties, they were by no\r\nmeans crushed and they continued in their legislative halls the conflict\r\nthat had gone against them upon the field of battle. But the political\r\nstruggle too was severe. It was in the decade from 1678 to 1688 that the\r\nStuart monarchs made their second attempt to crush Anglo-Saxon liberty,\r\nan attempt fully as dangerous for the colonies as for England. The\r\ndissolving of the three Whig Parliaments, and the acceptance of a\r\npension from Louis XIV were followed not only by the execution of\r\nliberal leaders and the withdrawal of town charters in the mother\r\ncountry, but by a deliberate attempt to suppress popular government in\r\nAmerica. It was not a mere coincidence that the attack upon the\r\nMassachusetts charter, the misrule of Nicholson in New York, the\r\noppressions of the proprietor in Maryland and the tyranny of Culpeper\r\nand Effingham in Virginia occurred simultaneously. They were all part\r\nand parcel of the policy of Charles II and James II.\r\n\r\nThese attempts met with failure in Virginia because of the stubborn\r\nresistance they encountered from the small farmer class and their\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Burgesses. The annulling of statutes by\r\nproclamation they denounced as illegal; they protested bitterly against\r\nthe appointment of their clerk by the Governor; they fought long to\r\nretain their ancient judicial privileges; they defeated all attempts of\r\nthe King and his representatives in Virginia to deprive them of the\r\nright to initiate legislation and to control taxation. And with the\r\nGlorious Revolution of 1688-89, which put an end forever to Stuart\r\naggressions, they could feel that their efforts alone had preserved\r\nliberty in Virginia, that they might now look forward to long years of\r\nhappiness and prosperity. The Virginia yeoman reckoned not with slavery,\r\nhowever, and slavery was to prove, in part at least, his undoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VII_\r\n\r\nWORLD TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1682 the depression which for nearly a quarter of a century had\r\ngripped the tobacco trade, somewhat abruptly came to an end. \"Our only\r\ncommodity, tobacco, having the last winter a pretty quick market, hath\r\nencouraged ye planters,\" wrote Secretary Spencer to the Board of Trade\r\nin May, 1683.[7-1] Apparently the tide had turned. From this time until\r\nthe beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession more than two decades\r\nlater we hear little complaint from Virginia, while there are excellent\r\nreasons to suppose that the colony was experiencing a period of growth\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn truth the tobacco trade, upon which the planters staked their all,\r\nnow expanded with startling rapidity, and each year the merchants were\r\nforced to add more bottoms to the fleet which sailed for England from\r\nthe Chesapeake. During the early years of the Restoration period tobacco\r\nexports from Virginia and Maryland had made but little advance. In 1663\r\nthey amounted to 7,367,140 pounds, six years later they were 9,026,046\r\npounds.[7-2] In 1698, however, the output of Virginia and Maryland was\r\nestimated by the merchant John Linton to be from 70,000 to 80,000\r\nhogsheads.[7-4] Since the hogshead usually contained from 500 to 600\r\npounds, these figures mean that the planters were then raising from\r\n35,000,000 to 48,000,000 pounds of tobacco. And this conclusion is\r\nsupported by the fact that the crop of 1699 is valued at £198,115, which\r\nat a penny a pound would indicate about 47,000,000 pounds.[7-5] In fact,\r\nthe production of tobacco in the ten years from 1689 to 1699 seems to\r\nhave tripled, in the years from 1669 to 1699 to have quadrupled. In 1669\r\nthe planters considered themselves fortunate if their industry yielded\r\nthem a return of £30,000; at the end of the century they could count\r\nwith a fair degree of certainty upon six times that amount.\r\n\r\nFor Virginia this startling development was all-important. During the\r\ndarkest days of the Restoration period her share of the total returns\r\nfrom the tobacco crop could hardly have exceeded £10,000; in 1699 it was\r\nestimated at £100,000. Even if we accept the conservative statement that\r\nthe average number of hogsheads exported from Virginia in the last\r\ndecade of the century varied from 35,000 to 40,000,[7-6] the planters\r\nstill would have received £75,000 or £80,000. From dire poverty and\r\ndistress the colony, almost in the twinkling of an eye, found itself in\r\ncomparative ease and plenty.\r\n\r\nNor is the reason difficult to discover. It had never been the intention\r\nof the British Government to destroy the foreign trade of the colonies,\r\nthe Navigation Acts having been designed only to force that trade\r\nthrough English channels. The planters were still at liberty to send\r\ntheir tobacco where they would, provided it went by way of England and\r\npaid the duty of a half penny a pound. That these restrictions so nearly\r\nput an end to shipments to the continent of Europe was an unfortunate\r\nconsequence which to some extent had been foreseen, but which for the\r\ntime being it was impossible to avoid.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly the hope of the Government that the foreign market\r\nwould eventually be regained and that the colonial tobacco would flow\r\nfrom the colonies into England and from England to all the countries of\r\nEurope. Prior to 1660 Holland had been the distributing centre for the\r\ntobacco of Virginia and Maryland; now England insisted upon taking this\r\nrôle upon herself. But the authorities at London were hardly less\r\nconcerned than the planters themselves at the difficulties encountered\r\nin effecting this change and the unfortunate glut in the home markets\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nNone the less they persisted in the policy they had adopted, even\r\nclinging stubbornly to the half penny a pound re-export duty, and\r\ntrusting that in time they could succeed in conquering for their tobacco\r\nthe lost continental markets. In this they were bitterly opposed by the\r\nDutch with whom it became necessary to fight two wars within the short\r\nspace of seven years. Yet steadily, although at first slowly, they made\r\nheadway. In 1681 the commissioners of the customs refused the request\r\nfor a cessation of tobacco planting in the colonies, on the ground that\r\nto lessen the crop would but stimulate production in foreign countries\r\nand so restrict the sale abroad of the Virginia and Maryland leaf.[7-7]\r\nThis argument has been denounced by some as both specious and selfish,\r\nyet it was fully justified by the situation then existing. After all,\r\nthe only hope for the planters lay in conquering the European market and\r\nthe way to do this was to flood England with tobacco until it overflowed\r\nall artificial barriers and poured across the Channel. And eventually\r\nthis is just what happened. Since tobacco was piling up uselessly in the\r\nwarehouses and much of it could not be disposed of at any price, it was\r\ninevitable that it should be dumped upon the other nations of Europe.\r\nThere is in this development a close parallel with the commercial policy\r\nof Germany in the years prior to the world war, when no effort was\r\nspared to produce a margin of all kinds of wares over the home needs,\r\nwhich was to be exported at excessively low prices. This margin was a\r\nweapon of conquest, a means of ousting the merchants of other nations\r\nfrom this market or that. And when once this conquest had been effected,\r\nthe price could be raised again in order to assure a profit to the\r\nGerman manufacturers.\r\n\r\nIt is improbable that the English economists of the Seventeenth century,\r\nlike those of modern Germany, had foreseen exactly what would happen,\r\nbut the results were none the less similar. When once the English leaf\r\nhad secured a strong hold upon the Baltic and upon France and Spain, it\r\nwas a matter of the greatest difficulty to oust it, especially as the\r\never increasing influx of slaves made it possible for the planters to\r\nmeet the lower prices of foreign competitors and still clear a profit.\r\nThus it was that during the years from 1680 to 1708 the Chesapeake\r\ntobacco succeeded in surmounting all the difficulties placed in its way\r\nby the Navigation Acts, the necessity of the double voyage, the\r\nre-export duty of a half penny a pound, and so gradually flooded the\r\ncontinental market.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that figures for re-exported tobacco during the\r\nearlier years of the Restoration period are lacking. In 1688, however,\r\nit is stated that the duty of a half penny a pound was yielding the\r\nCrown an annual revenue of £15,000, which would indicate that about\r\n7,200,000 pounds were leaving for foreign ports.[7-8] Ten years later,\r\nif we may believe the testimony of John Linton, exports of tobacco\r\ntotalled 50,000 or 60,000 hogsheads, or from 25,000,000 to 30,000,000\r\npounds. Not more than a fourth of the colonial leaf, he tells us, was\r\nconsumed in England itself.[7-9] Once more Virginia and Maryland were\r\nproducing tobacco for all Europe, once more they enjoyed a world market.\r\n\r\nThis trade was extended from one end of the continent to the other.\r\nVessels laden with American tobacco found their way not only to the\r\nports of France and Holland and Spain, but even to the distant cities of\r\nSweden and Russia.[7-10] The Baltic trade alone amounted to from 5,000\r\nto 10,000 hogsheads, and added from £10,000 to £24,000 to the income of\r\nthe planters. The chief Russian port of entry was Narva, which took\r\nannually some 500 hogsheads, but large quantities were shipped also to\r\nRiga and Raval.[7-11] The northern nations bought the cheaper varieties,\r\nfor no tobacco could be too strong for the hardy men of Sweden and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe trade was of great importance to England, as the leaf, after it had\r\ngone through the process of manufacture, sold for about six pence a\r\npound, yielding to the nation in all from £60,000 to £130,000.[7-12] As\r\nthe English were still largely dependent upon the Baltic for potash and\r\nship stores, this constituted a most welcome addition to the balance of\r\ntrade. To the colonies also it was vital, carrying off a large part of\r\nthe annual crop, and so tending to sustain prices.\r\n\r\nFrance, too, proved a good customer for English tobacco, and in the\r\nyears prior to the War of the Spanish Succession took annually from\r\n8,000 to 10,000 hogsheads, or from 4,000,000 to 6,000,000 pounds.[7-13]\r\nMicajah Perry reported to the Lords of Trade that from 6,000 to 10,000\r\nhogsheads went to France from London alone, while a very considerable\r\namount was sent also from other ports.[7-14]\r\n\r\nFar more surprising is the fact that even Spain consumed millions of\r\npounds of English leaf. With her own colonies producing the best tobacco\r\nin the world and in the face of its practical exclusion from the English\r\nmarket, it is strange that the Government at Madrid should have\r\npermitted this commerce to continue. The obvious course for the\r\nSpaniards under the economic theories of the day would have been to\r\nexclude English tobacco, both in order to protect their own planters and\r\nto retaliate for the restrictions upon their product. Yet it is\r\nestimated that from 6,000 to 10,000 hogsheads entered Spain each\r\nyear.[7-15] A pamphlet published in 1708 entitled _The Present State of\r\nTobacco Plantations in America_ stated that before the outbreak of the\r\nwar then raging, France and Spain together had taken annually about\r\n20,000 hogsheads.[7-16]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, too, despite their bitter rivalry with the British, found it\r\nimpossible to do without Virginia tobacco. Purchasing the finest bright\r\nOrinoco, they mixed it with leaf of their own growth in the proportion\r\nof one to four, and sold it to other European nations. In this way they\r\nsought to retain their position as a distributing center for the trade\r\nand to give employment to hundreds of poor workers. In all the Dutch\r\nseem to have purchased from England about 5,000 hogsheads a year.[7-17]\r\n\r\nThe enhanced importance of the tobacco trade is reflected in a steady\r\nincrease of British exports to Virginia and Maryland. The planters, now\r\nthat they found it possible to market their leaf, laid out the proceeds\r\nin the manufactured products of England. At the end of the Seventeenth\r\ncentury the two colonies were importing goods to the value of £200,000\r\nannually. In 1698, which was an exceptionally good year, their purchases\r\nwere no less than £310,133.[7-18]\r\n\r\nIn short the tobacco colonies had at last found their proper place in\r\nthe British colonial system. Both they and the mother country, after\r\nlong years of experimentation, years of misfortune and recrimination,\r\nhad reached a common ground upon which to stand. Although Maryland and\r\nVirginia still fell short of the ideal set for the British colonies,\r\nalthough they failed to furnish the raw stuffs so urgently needed by the\r\nhome industries, at least they yielded a product which added materially\r\nto shipping, weighed heavily in the balance of trade and brought a\r\nwelcome revenue to the royal Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Crown reaped a rich return from tobacco, a return which grew not\r\nonly with the expansion of the trade, but by the imposition from time to\r\ntime of heavier duties. In the period from 1660 to 1685, when the tariff\r\nremained at two pence a pound, the yield must have varied from £75,000\r\nto £100,000. If we assume that the average consumption in England was\r\n9,000,000 pounds and the average exports 3,000,000 the total revenue\r\nwould have been £81,250. In 1685, however, an additional duty of three\r\npence a pound was placed upon tobacco upon its arrival in England, all\r\nof which was refunded when the product was re-exported. In 1688, when\r\nthe tobacco consumed in England was 8,328,800 pounds, the old and new\r\nduties, amounting in all to five pence, must have yielded £173,515. When\r\nto this is added £15,000 from the half penny a pound on the 7,200,000\r\npounds of leaf sent abroad, the total reaches £188,515.\r\n\r\nIn 1698 still another penny a pound was added to the tax, making a grand\r\ntotal of six pence on colonial tobacco disposed of in England. This new\r\nduty, together with the rapid increase in the foreign trade, enriched\r\nthe Exchequer by another £100,000. In 1699, if we assume that 12,000,000\r\npounds were consumed in England, the return would have been £300,000;\r\nwhile half a penny a pound on 36,000,000 pounds of re-exported leaf,\r\nwould have brought the total to £375,000. That this figure was\r\napproximately correct we have evidence in the statement of the author of\r\n_The Present State of the Tobacco Plantations_, written in 1705, that\r\nthe revenue yielded by the tobacco of Virginia and Maryland amounted\r\nannually to £400,000.[7-19] This sum constituted a very appreciable\r\nproportion of the royal income, so appreciable in fact as to make the\r\ntobacco trade a matter of vital importance in the eyes of the King's\r\nministers. They were charged at all times to avoid any contingency which\r\nmight lessen the imports and reduce the customs.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the tobacco trade stimulated industry, not only by\r\nincreasing exports to Virginia and Maryland, but also by creating a new\r\nEnglish industry. For most of the tobacco, before it was sent abroad,\r\nwas subjected to a process of manufacture, by which the leaf was cut and\r\nrolled and otherwise prepared for the consumer. This industry gave\r\nemployment to hundreds of poor persons in England and required a\r\nconsiderable outlay of capital.[7-20]\r\n\r\nTo British navigation the trade was vital. Each year scores of\r\nmerchantmen crossed to the Chesapeake and swarmed in every river and\r\ncreek, delivering their English goods to the planters and taking in\r\nreturn the hogsheads of tobacco. In 1690 the tobacco fleet numbered\r\nabout 100 ships, aggregating 13,715 tons; in 1706 it counted no less\r\nthan 300 sails.[7-21] Nor must it be forgotten that re-exported tobacco\r\nalso added many a goodly merchantman to the navy and gave employment to\r\nmany a seaman. Altogether Virginia and Maryland constituted an\r\ninvaluable asset, an asset which ranked in importance secondly only to\r\nthe sugar plantations.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be supposed that the fortunate turn of events which\r\nrestored to the tobacco colonies their European market would have\r\nreacted favorably upon the small planters of Virginia, not only insuring\r\nplenty to those already established, but adding new recruits from the\r\nranks of the indentured servants; that the process of making prosperous\r\nfreemen from the poor immigrants who flocked to the colony, the process\r\ninterrupted by the passage of the Navigation Acts, would have been\r\nresumed now that these laws no longer prevented the flow of tobacco into\r\nthe continental countries.\r\n\r\nSuch was not the case, however. A comparison of the lists of immigrants\r\nwith the rent roll of 1704 shows that but an insignificant proportion of\r\nthe newcomers succeeded in establishing themselves as landowners. In\r\nfour lists examined for the year 1689, comprising 332 names, but seven\r\npersons can be positively identified upon the rent roll. In 1690, eight\r\nlists of 933 names, reveal but twenty-eight persons who were landowners\r\nin 1704. Of 274 immigrants listed in 1691, six only appear on the Roll.\r\nIn 1695, seven lists comprising 711 names, show but ten who possessed\r\nfarms nine years later. Of 74 headrights appearing in 1696, but two are\r\nlisted on the roll; of 119 in 1697 only nine; of 169 in 1698 one only;\r\nof 454 in 1699, only seven; of 223 in 1700 but six.[7-22] All in all not\r\nmore than five per cent. of the newcomers during this period prospered\r\nand became independent planters. Apparently, then, the restored\r\nprosperity of the colony was not shared by the poorer classes, the\r\nincreased market for tobacco did not better materially the chances of\r\nthe incoming flood of indentured servants.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this state of affairs is found in the fact that\r\ntobacco, despite its widened market, experienced no very pronounced rise\r\nin price. The average return to the planters during the good years seems\r\nto have been one penny a pound.[7-23] This, it is true, constituted an\r\nadvance over the worst days of the Restoration period, but it was far\r\nfrom approaching the prices of the Civil war and Commonwealth periods.\r\nFor the poor freedman, it was not sufficient to provide for his support\r\nand at the same time make it possible to accumulate a working capital.\r\nHe could not, as he had done a half century earlier, lay aside enough to\r\npurchase a farm, stock it with cattle, hogs and poultry, perhaps even\r\nsecure a servant or two. Now, although no longer reduced to misery and\r\nrags as in the years from 1660 to 1682, he could consider himself\r\nfortunate if his labor sufficed to provide wholesome food and warm\r\nclothing. How, it may be asked, could Virginia and Maryland produce the\r\nvast crops now required by the foreign trade, if the price was still so\r\nlow? Prior to and just after Bacon's Rebellion the planters repeatedly\r\nasserted that their labors only served to bring them into debt, that to\r\nproduce an extensive crop was the surest way for one to ruin himself.\r\nWhy was it that twenty years later, although prices were still far below\r\nthe old level, they could flood the markets of the world?\r\n\r\nThe answer can be summed up in one word--slavery. The first cargo of\r\nnegroes arrived in the colony in 1619 upon a Dutch privateer. Presumably\r\nthey were landed at Jamestown, and sold there to the planters.[7-24] The\r\nvessel which won fame for itself by this ill-starred action, was sailing\r\nunder letters of marque from the Prince of Orange and had been scouring\r\nthe seas in search of Spanish prizes. Although the Dutch master could\r\nhave had no information that slaves were wanted in the colony, he seems\r\nto have taken it for granted that he would not be forbidden to dispose\r\nof his human freight.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this handful of negroes--there were but twenty in\r\nall--was not the real beginning of the slave system in the colonies. For\r\nmany years the institution which was to play so sinister a part in\r\nAmerican history did not flourish, and the slaves grew in numbers but\r\nslowly. In the Muster Roll of Settlers in Virginia, taken in 1624, there\r\nwere listed only 22 negroes.[7-25] Sixteen years later the black\r\npopulation probably did not exceed 150.[7-26] In 1649, when Virginia was\r\ngrowing rapidly and the whites numbered 15,000, there were but 300\r\nnegroes in the colony.[7-27] A sporadic importation of slaves continued\r\nduring the Commonwealth period, but still the number was insignificant,\r\nstill the bulk of the labor in the tobacco fields was done by indentured\r\nservants and poor freeholders.\r\n\r\nIn 1670 Governor Berkeley reported to the Board of Trade that out of a\r\ntotal population of 40,000, but five per cent were slaves.[7-28] Eleven\r\nyears later the number of blacks was estimated at 3,000.[7-29] In 1635\r\ntwenty-six negroes were brought in, the largest purchaser being Charles\r\nHarmar.[7-30] In 1636 the importations were but seven, in 1637 they\r\nwere 28, in 1638 thirty, in 1639 forty-six, in 1642 seven only, in 1643\r\neighteen, in 1649 seventeen.[7-31] But with the passage of the years\r\nsomewhat larger cargoes began to arrive. In 1662 Richard Lee claimed\r\namong his headrights no less than 80 negroes, in 1665 the Scarboroughs\r\nimported thirty-nine. In 1670, however, Berkeley declared that \"not\r\nabove two or three ships of Negroes\" had arrived in the province in the\r\nprevious seven years.[7-32]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that during the larger part of the Seventeenth\r\ncentury slavery played but an unimportant rôle in the economic and\r\nsocial life of the colony. The planters were exceedingly anxious to make\r\nuse of slave labor, which they considered the foundation of the\r\nprosperity of their rivals of the Spanish tobacco colonies, but slave\r\nlabor was most difficult to obtain. The trade had for many years been\r\nchiefly in the hands of the Dutch, and these enterprising navigators\r\nsold most of their negroes to the Spanish plantations. Ever since the\r\ndays of Henry VIII the English had made efforts to secure a share of\r\nthis profitable traffic, but with very meagre success.[7-33]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch had established trading stations along the African coast,\r\nguarded by forts and war vessels. Any attempts of outsiders to intrude\r\nupon the commerce was regarded by them as an act of open aggression to\r\nbe resisted by force of arms. To enter the trade with any hope of\r\nsuccess it became necessary for the English to organize a company rich\r\nenough to furnish armed protection to their merchantmen. But no such\r\norganization could be established during the Civil War and Commonwealth\r\nperiods, and it was not until 1660 that the African Company, under the\r\nleadership of the Duke of York entered the field.[7-34]\r\n\r\nThis was but the beginning of the struggle, however. The Dutch resisted\r\nstrenuously, stirring up the native chieftains against the English,\r\nseizing their vessels and breaking up their stations. Not until two wars\r\nhad been fought was England able to wring from the stubborn\r\nNetherlanders an acknowledgment of her right to a share in the trade.\r\nEven then the Virginians were not adequately supplied, for the sugar\r\nislands were clamoring for slaves, and as they occupied so important a\r\nplace in the colonial system they were the first to be served.\r\nThroughout the last quarter of the Seventeenth century negroes in fairly\r\nlarge numbers began to arrive in the Chesapeake, but it was only in the\r\nyears from 1700 to 1720 that they actually accomplished the overthrow of\r\nthe old system of labor and laid the foundations of a new social\r\nstructure. Throughout the Seventeenth century the economic system of the\r\ntobacco colonies depended upon the labor of the poor white man, whether\r\nfree or under terms of indenture; in the Eighteenth century it rested\r\nchiefly upon the black shoulders of the African slave.\r\n\r\nThere could be no manner of doubt as to the desirability of the slaves\r\nfrom an economic standpoint, apparently the only standpoint that\r\nreceived serious consideration. The indentured servant could be held\r\nusually for but a few years. Hardly had he reached his greatest\r\nusefulness for his master than he demanded his freedom. Thus for the man\r\nof large means to keep his fields always in cultivation it was necessary\r\nconstantly to renew his supply of laborers. If he required twenty hands,\r\nhe must import each year some five or six servants, or run the risk of\r\nfinding himself running behind. But the slave served for life. The\r\nplanter who had purchased a full supply of negroes could feel that his\r\nlabor problems were settled once and for all. Not only could he hold the\r\nslaves themselves for life, but their children also became his property\r\nand took their places in the tobacco fields as soon as they approached\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nThus in the end the slave was far cheaper. The price of a servant\r\ndepended largely upon the cost of his passage across the ocean. We find\r\nthat William Matthews, having three years and nine months to serve, was\r\nrated in the inventory of his master, John Thomas, at £12.[7-35] A\r\nservant of Robert Leightenhouse, having two years to serve, was put at\r\n£9;[7-36] while on the other hand we find another listed in the estate\r\nof Colonel Francis Epes, also having two years to serve, at only\r\n£5.[7-37] A white lad under indenture for seven years to Mr. Ralph\r\nGraves was valued at £10.[7-38] On the whole it would seem that the\r\nprice of a sturdy man servant varied from £2 to £4 for each year of his\r\nservice. On the other hand a vigorous slave could be had at from £18 to\r\n£30. Assuming that he gave his master twenty-five years of service, the\r\ncost for each year would be but one pound sterling. There could be no\r\ndoubt, then, that in the mere matter of cost he was much cheaper than\r\nthe indentured white man.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the negro was none too efficient as a laborer. Born in\r\nsavagery, unacquainted with the English tongue, knowing little of\r\nagriculture, it was a matter of some difficulty for him to accustom\r\nhimself to his task in the tobacco fields. Yet when his lesson had been\r\nlearned, when a few years of experience had taught him what his master\r\nexpected him to do, the slave showed himself quite adequate to the\r\nrequirements of the one staple crop. The culture of tobacco is not\r\nessentially difficult, especially when pursued in the unscientific\r\nmanner of the colonial period. It required many, but not skilled hands.\r\nThe slave, untutored and unintelligent, proved inadequate to the\r\nindustrial needs of the northern colonies. The niceties of shipbuilding\r\nwere beyond his capacities, he was not needed as a fisherman, he was not\r\na good sailor, he was useless in the system of intensive agriculture in\r\nvogue north of Maryland. But in the tobacco field he would do. He could\r\nnot at first tend so many plants as his white rival, he could not\r\nproduce tobacco of such fine quality, but what he lacked in efficiency\r\nhe more than made up for in cheapness.\r\n\r\nThe African seems to have withstood remarkably well the diseases\r\nindigenous to eastern Virginia. There are occasional reports of\r\nepidemics among the slaves, but usually they were fairly immune both to\r\nmalaria and dysentery. A census taken in 1714, when there were perhaps\r\n15,000 negroes in the colony, records burials for sixty-two slaves\r\nonly.[7-39] The births of slaves for the same year totalled 253.[7-40]\r\nThese figures indicate not only the excellent physical condition in\r\nwhich these black workers were kept by their masters, but the rapidity\r\nwith which they were multiplying. The low death rate is in part\r\nexplained by the fact that only strong men and women were transported to\r\nthe colonies, but it is none the less clearly indicative of the ease\r\nwith which the African accustomed himself to the climate of tidewater\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the negro was more docile than the white servant, especially\r\nif the latter happened to be from the ruder elements of English society.\r\nHe was not so apt to resist his master or to run away to the mountains.\r\nYet plots among the blacks were not unknown. In 1710 a conspiracy was\r\ndiscovered among the slaves of Surry and James City counties which was\r\nto have been put into execution on Easter day. The negroes planned to\r\nrise simultaneously, destroy any who stood in their way, and make good\r\ntheir escape out of the colony. Among the chief conspirators were Jamy,\r\nbelonging to Mr. John Broadnax, Mr. Samuel Thompson's Peter, Tom and\r\nCato of Mr. William Edwards, Great Jack and Little Jack of Mr. John\r\nEdwards, and Will belonging to Mr. Henry Hart. \"Two or three of these\r\nwere tried this general court,\" wrote Colonel Jennings, \"found guilty\r\nand will be executed. And I hope their fate will strike such a terror\r\nin the other Negroes as will keep them from forming such designs for the\r\nfuture.\"[7-41] The lesson did not prove lasting, however, for in 1730 a\r\nnumber of slaves from Norfolk and Princess Anne counties assembled while\r\nthe whites were at church, and chose officers to command them in a bold\r\nstroke for freedom. As in the previous attempt they were discovered,\r\nmany arrested and several of the ringleaders executed.[7-42]\r\n\r\nNeither the merchants nor the planters seem to have been conscious of\r\nany wrong in the seizure and sale of negroes. They regarded the native\r\nAfricans as hardly human, mere savages that were no more deserving of\r\nconsideration than oxen or horses. And as it was right and proper to\r\nhitch the ox or the horse to the plow, so it was equally legitimate to\r\nput the negro to work in the fields of sugar cane or tobacco. Whatever\r\nhardships he had to endure upon the voyage to America or by reason of\r\nhis enforced labor, they considered amply compensated by his conversion\r\nto Christianity.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the colony of Virginia early in the Eighteenth century\r\nimposed a heavy duty upon the importation of slaves, but it did so\r\nneither from any consciousness of wrong in slavery itself or a\r\nperception of the social problems which were to grow out of it. At the\r\ntime the price of tobacco was declining rapidly and many planters were\r\nlosing money. Feeling that their misfortunes arose from overproduction,\r\nwhich in turn was the result of the recent purchases of negroes, the\r\ncolonial legislators decided to check the trade. \"The great number of\r\nnegroes imported here and solely employed in making tobacco,\" wrote\r\nGovernor Spotswood in 1711, \"hath produced for some years past an\r\nincrease in tobacco far disproportionate to the consumption of it ...\r\nand consequently lowered the price of it.\"[7-43] \"The people of Virginia\r\nwill not now be so fond of purchasing negroes as of late,\" declared\r\nPresident Jennings of the Virginia Council in 1708, \"being sensibly\r\nconvinced of their error, which has in a manner ruined the credit of the\r\ncountry.\"[7-44]\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1680 to 1700 slaves arrived in the colony in\r\nincreasing numbers. In 1681 William Fitzhugh, in a letter to Ralph\r\nWormeley, refers to the fact that several slave ships were expected that\r\nyear in the York river.[7-45] At this period, for the first time in\r\nVirginia history, we find negroes in large numbers entered as headrights\r\nupon the patent rolls. In 1693 Captain John Storey received a grant of\r\nland for the importation of 79 negroes, in 1694 Robert Beverley brought\r\nin seventy, in 1695 William Randolph twenty-five.[7-46] Before the end\r\nof the century it is probable that the slaves in Virginia numbered\r\nnearly 6,000, and had already become more important to the economic life\r\nof the colony than the indentured servants.[7-47]\r\n\r\nThe chief purchasers at this time were men of large estates. The\r\nadvantages of slave labor were manifest to planters of the type of\r\nWilliam Byrd or William Fitzhugh, men who had built up fortunes by their\r\nbusiness ability. It is but natural that they should have turned early\r\nfrom the indentured servant to stock their plantations with the cheaper\r\nand more remunerative African workers.\r\n\r\nAs the English secured a stronger hold upon the African trade slaves\r\narrived in ever increasing numbers. During the years from 1699 to 1708\r\nno less than 6,843 came in, a number perhaps exceeding the entire\r\nimportations of the Seventeenth century.[7-48] In the summer of 1705\r\nalone 1,800 negroes arrived.[7-49] With what rapidity the black man was\r\ntaking the place of the indentured servant and the poor freeman as the\r\nchief laborer of the colony is shown by the fact that in 1708, in a\r\ntotal tithable list of 30,000, no less than 12,000 were slaves.\r\nPresident Jennings at the same time reported that the number of\r\nservants was inconsiderable.[7-50] \"Before the year 1680 what negroes\r\ncame to Virginia were usually from Barbadoes,\" Jennings told the Board\r\nof Trade in 1708. \"Between 1680 and 1698 the negro trade become more\r\nfrequent, tho not in any proportion to what it hath been of late, during\r\nwhich the African Company have sent several ships and others by their\r\nlicence having bought their slaves of the Company brought them here for\r\nsale, among which lately Alderman Jeffreys and Sir Jeffry Jeffreys were\r\nprincipally concerned.\"[7-51]\r\n\r\nThe wars of Charles XII, however, which proved disastrous to the Baltic\r\ntrade, and the War of the Spanish Succession which cut off exports of\r\ntobacco to France and Spain, caused a serious decline in prices and made\r\nit impossible for the planters to continue the large purchases of\r\nslaves. This fact, together with the duty which had been imposed with\r\nthe express purpose of keeping them out, reduced the importations to a\r\nminimum during the years from 1710 to 1718.[7-52] But with the reopening\r\nof the tobacco market and the return of prosperity to Virginia, the\r\nblack stream set in again with redoubled force. In 1730, out of a total\r\npopulation of 114,000, no less than 30,000 were negroes.[7-53] In other\r\nwords the slaves, who in 1670 had constituted but five per cent of the\r\npeople, now comprised twenty-six per cent. Slavery, from being an\r\ninsignificant factor in the economic life of the colony, had become the\r\nvery foundation upon which it was established.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen it was not slavery but the protracted accumulation of\r\nsurplus stocks of tobacco in England which had broken the long continued\r\ndeadlock of the tobacco trade during the Restoration period and caused\r\nthe overflow into continental markets. That the labor of blacks at first\r\nplayed no essential part in the movement is evident from the fact that\r\nin 1682 when it first became pronounced, the slave population of\r\nVirginia and Maryland was still insignificant. But that the trade not\r\nonly continued after the glut in England had been cleared up, but\r\nincreased with startling rapidity, was unquestionably the result of more\r\nuniversal use of negroes in the years immediately preceding the War of\r\nthe Spanish Succession. Slavery so cheapened the cost of production that\r\nit was now quite possible for those who used them to pay the half penny\r\na pound duty on reëxported tobacco in England, and still undersell all\r\nrivals in the European market. Before many years had passed the tobacco\r\ntrade, with all that it meant both to England and to the colonies,\r\nrested almost entirely upon the labor of the savage black man so\r\nrecently brought from the African wilds.\r\n\r\nThat this fact was fully understood at the time is attested by various\r\npersons interested in the colony and the trade. In 1728 Francis Fane, in\r\nprotesting against the imposition of a new tax in Virginia on the\r\nimportation of slaves declared \"that Laying a Duty on Negroes can only\r\ntend to make them scarcer and dearer, the two things that for the good\r\nof our Trade and for the Benefit of Virginia ought chiefly to be guarded\r\nagainst, since it is well known that the cheepness of Virginia tobacco\r\nin European Marketts is the true Cause of the great Consumption thereof\r\nin Europe, and one would have therefore Expected rather to have seen an\r\nAct allowing a premium on the Importation of Negroes to have Encouraged\r\nthe bringing them in, than an Act laying so large a Duty to discourage\r\ntheir Importation.\"[7-54] Similarly Colonel Spencer wrote to the Board\r\nof Trade. \"The low price of tobacco requires it should be made as cheap\r\nas possible. The Blacks can make it cheaper than Whites, so I conceive\r\nit is for his Majesty's interest full as much as the Country's or rather\r\nmuch more, to have Blacks as cheap as possible in Virginia.\"[7-55]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the opening of the European market and the\r\nvast expansion of the tobacco trade, while bringing prosperity to the\r\nlarger planters, was no great boon to the man who tilled his fields with\r\nhis own hands. It assured him a ready sale for his crop, it is true, but\r\nat prices so low as to leave him a very narrow margin of profit. The new\r\nera which was opening, the so-called golden era of Virginia history, was\r\nnot for him. Virginia in the Eighteenth century was to be the land of\r\nthe slave holder, not of the little planter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VIII_\r\n\r\nBENEATH THE BLACK TIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importation of slaves in large numbers reacted almost immediately\r\nupon the migration of whites to Virginia. As we have seen, the stream of\r\nindentured servants that poured across the Atlantic remained remarkably\r\nconstant throughout almost all of the Seventeenth century. The larger\r\nplanters were always in need of laborers, and they looked to the surplus\r\npopulation of England to supply them. But with the coming of the blacks\r\nall was changed. The Virginians saw in the slave ships which now so\r\nfrequently entered their rivers the solution of all their problems. And\r\nso the influx of white men and women from the mother country dwindled\r\nand almost died out, while in its place came a still greater stream from\r\nthe coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Bacon's Rebellion the annual importation of servants was\r\nbetween 1,500 and 2,000. The headrights for 1674 show 1931 names.[8-1]\r\nSeven years later the whites were still arriving in large numbers, the\r\nrolls for 1682 having 1,565 names. As the century drew to a close,\r\nhowever, the effect of the slave trade upon white immigration is\r\nreflected in the dwindling number of headrights. The change that was\r\ntaking place is illustrated by a patent of 13,500 acres to Ralph\r\nWormleley for the transportation of 249 persons, 149 of whom were white\r\nand 100 black.[8-2] Yet so late as 1704 the servants were still coming\r\nin appreciable numbers. In 1708 however, the number of servants at work\r\nin the colony had dwindled away almost entirely.[8-3] In 1715 the names\r\nof white persons listed as headrights was but ninety-one; in 1718 but\r\n101.[8-4] In other words, the first great migration of Englishmen to\r\ncontinental America, a migration extending over a century and comprising\r\nfrom 100,000 to 150,000 men, women and children, had practically come to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nEnglish statesmen at the time looked upon this event as an unalloyed\r\nblessing. The day had passed when they felt that there existed a surplus\r\nof labor at home and that the country was in need of blood letting. The\r\nproper policy was to keep Englishmen in England, to devote their\r\nenergies to local industries and so strengthen the economic and military\r\nsinews of the nation. And if unemployment existed, it was the correct\r\npolicy to bring work to the idle rather than send the idle out of the\r\ncountry in quest of work.[8-5] And the colonies were to be utilized, no\r\nlonger as outlets for the population, but as a means to the upbuilding\r\nof local industry. They were to supply a market for English goods, keep\r\nemployed English mariners and furnish the tobacco and sugar which when\r\nre-exported weighed so heavily in the balance of trade. And since these\r\ngreat staple crops could be produced by the work of slaves, it was\r\nthought highly advantageous for all concerned that the negro should\r\nreplace the white servant in both the tobacco and the sugar fields. The\r\nplanters would profit by the lowered cost of production, English\r\nindustry would gain by the increased volume of traffic, the Crown\r\nrevenues would be enhanced and English laborers would be kept at\r\nhome.[8-6]\r\n\r\nApparently the deeper significance of this great movement was entirely\r\nlost upon the British economists and ministers. They had no conception\r\nof the advantage of having their colonies inhabited by one race alone\r\nand that race their own. From the first their vision was too restricted\r\nto embrace the idea of a new and greater Britain in its fullest sense.\r\nThey could not bring themselves to look upon the soil of Virginia and\r\nMaryland as a part of the soil of an extended England, upon the\r\nVirginians and Marylanders as Englishmen, enjoying privileges equal to\r\ntheir own. They could not realize the strength that would come from such\r\nan empire as this, the mighty future it would insure to the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nTheir conception was different. The British empire must consist of two\r\ndistinct parts--mother country and colonies. And in any clash of\r\ninterest between the two, the former must prevail. It was not their\r\nintent that the colonies should be purposely sacrificed, that they\r\nshould be made to pay tribute to a tyrannical parent. In fact, they\r\nearnestly desired that the plantations should prosper, for when they\r\nlanguished English industry suffered. But in their eyes the colonies\r\nexisted primarily for the benefit of England. England had given them\r\nbirth, had defended them, had nurtured them; she was amply justified,\r\ntherefore, in subordinating them to her own industrial needs.\r\n\r\nThus they viewed the substitution of the importation of slaves to the\r\ntobacco colonies for the importation of white men purely from an\r\nEnglish, not an Anglo-Saxon, point of view. Had it been a question of\r\nbringing thousands of negroes to England itself to drive the white\r\nlaborers from the fields, they would have interposed an emphatic veto.\r\nBut with the structure of colonial life they were not greatly concerned.\r\nIn 1693, when James Blair secured from the King and Queen a gift for his\r\nnew college at Williamsburg, Attorney-General Seymour objected\r\nvigorously, stating that there was not the least occasion for such an\r\ninstitution in Virginia. Blair reminded him that the chief purpose of\r\nthe college was to educate young men for the ministry and begged him to\r\nconsider that the people of the colony had souls to be saved as well as\r\nthe people of England. \"Souls! Damn your souls,\" snapped the\r\nAttorney-General, \"make tobacco.\"[8-7] It would be unfair to say that\r\nthe British Government took just the same view of the colonists as did\r\nSeymour, but there can be no doubt that their chief concern in the\r\nplantations was centered upon the size of their exports to England and\r\nof their purchases of English goods. And as the slaves could make more\r\ntobacco than the indentured servants, it became the settled policy of\r\nthe Crown to encourage the African trade in every possible way.\r\n\r\nThe influx of slaves not only put almost a complete end to the\r\nimportation of white servants, but it reacted disastrously upon the\r\nVirginia yeomanry. In this respect we find a close parallel with the\r\nexperience of ancient Rome with slave labor. In the third and second\r\ncenturies before Christ the glory of the republic lay in its peasantry.\r\nThe self-reliant, sturdy, liberty-loving yeoman formed the backbone of\r\nthe conquering legion and added to the life of the republic that rugged\r\nstrength that made it so irresistible. \"To say that a citizen is a good\r\nfarmer is to reach the extreme limit of praise,\" said Cato. Some of the\r\nablest of the early Roman generals were recruited from the small farmer\r\nclass. Fabius Maximus, the Dictator, in need of money, sent his son to\r\nRome to sell his sole possession, a little farm of seven jugera.\r\nRegulus, while in Africa, asked that he be recalled from his command\r\nbecause the hired man he had left to cultivate his fields had fled with\r\nall his farm implements, and he feared his wife and children would\r\nstarve.[8-8]\r\n\r\nThis vigorous peasantry was destroyed by the importation of hordes of\r\nslaves and the purchase of cheap foreign grain. So long as the wars of\r\nRome were limited to Italy the number of slaves was comparatively small,\r\nbut as her armies swept over the Mediterranean countries one after\r\nanother and even subdued the wild Gauls and Britains, an unending stream\r\nof captives poured into the city and filled to overflowing the slave\r\nmarkets. Cicero, during his short campaign against the Parthians wrote\r\nto Atticus that the sale of his prisoners had netted no less than\r\n12,000,000 sestercias. In Epirus 100,000 men were captured; 60,000\r\nCimbries and 100,000 Germans graced the triumph of Marius; Caesar is\r\nsaid to have taken in Gaul another 100,000 prisoners. Soon the slave\r\nbecame the cheapest of commodities, and he who possessed even the most\r\nextensive lands could readily supply himself with the labor requisite\r\nfor their cultivation.\r\n\r\nThus thrown into competition with slave labor the peasant proprietor\r\nfound it impossible to sustain himself. The grain which he produced with\r\nhis own hands had to compete in the same market with that made by\r\nslaves. It must, therefore, sell for the same price, a price so low that\r\nit did not suffice to feed and clothe him and his family. So he was\r\nforced to give up his little estate, an estate perhaps handed down to\r\nhim by generations of farmers, and migrate to the city of Rome, to swell\r\nthe idle and plebeian population. And once there he demanded bread, a\r\ndemand which the authorities dared not refuse. So the public treasury\r\nlaid out the funds for the purchase of wheat from all parts of the\r\nworld, from Spain, from Africa, from Sicily, wheat which was given away\r\nor sold for a song. This in turn reacted unfavorably upon the peasants\r\nwho still clung to the soil in a desperate effort to wring from it a\r\nbare subsistence, and accelerated the movement to the city.\r\n\r\nThus Italy was transformed from the land of the little farmer into the\r\nland of big estates cultivated by slaves. A sad development surely, a\r\ndevelopment which had much to do with the decay and final overthrow of\r\nthe mighty structure of the Roman Empire. In former times, Titus Livius\r\ntells us, \"there was a multitude of free men in this country where today\r\nwe can hardly find a handful of soldiers, and which would be a\r\nwilderness were it not for our slaves.\" \"The plough is everywhere\r\nbereft of honor,\" wrote Virgil, while Lucian bewailed the departed\r\npeasants whose places were taken by fettered slaves.[8-9]\r\n\r\nThe importation of slaves to Virginia had somewhat similar results.\r\nWhile not destroying entirely the little farmer class, it exerted a\r\nbaleful influence upon it, driving many families out of the colony,\r\nmaking the rich man richer, reducing the poor man to dire poverty.\r\nAgainst this unfortunate development the Virginia yeoman was helpless.\r\nInstinctively he must have felt that the slave was his enemy, and the\r\nhatred and rivalry which even today exists between the negro and the\r\nlowest class of whites, the so-called \"poor white trash,\" dates back to\r\nthe Seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe emigration of poor persons, usually servants just freed, from\r\nVirginia to neighboring colonies was well under way even at the time of\r\nBacon's Rebellion. In 1677 complaint was made of \"the inconvenience\r\nwhich arose from the neighborhood of Maryland and North Carolina,\" in\r\nthat Virginia was daily deprived of its inhabitants by the removal of\r\npoor men hither. Runaway servants were welcomed in both places, it was\r\nasserted, while the debtor was accorded protection against\r\nprosecution.[8-10] This early emigration was caused, of course, not by\r\nthe importation of slaves, for that movement had not yet assumed\r\nimportant proportions, but by the evil consequences of the Navigation\r\nActs. The Virginia yeoman moved on to other colonies because he found it\r\nimpossible to maintain himself at the current price of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of the movement, for it persisted for a full half\r\ncentury, must be ascribed to the competition of negro labor. Like the\r\nRoman peasant, the Virginia yeoman, to an extent at least, found it\r\nimpossible to maintain himself in the face of slave competition. The\r\nservant, upon the expiration of his term, no longer staked off his\r\nlittle farm and settled down to a life of usefulness and industry. The\r\npoor planter who had not yet fully established himself, sold or deserted\r\nhis fields and moved away in search of better opportunities and higher\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nThis migration was not the first of its kind in the English colonies,\r\nfor the movement of Massachusetts congregations into the valley of the\r\nConnecticut antedated it by several decades. Yet it furnishes an\r\ninteresting illustration of the lack of permanency in American life, of\r\nthe facility with which populations urged on by economic pressure of one\r\nkind or another change localities. The great movement westward over the\r\nAppalachian range which followed the War of 1812, the pilgrimages of\r\nhomesteaders to the northwest and the Pacific coast, find their\r\nprecedent in the exodus of these poor families from the tobacco fields\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade of the Seventeenth century the migration assumed such\r\nlarge proportions that the Board of Trade became alarmed and directed\r\nFrancis Nicholson to enquire into its cause in order that steps might be\r\ntaken to stop it. The emigrant stream that directed itself northward did\r\nnot halt in eastern Maryland, for conditions there differed little from\r\nthose in Virginia itself. The settlers went on to the unoccupied lands\r\nin the western part of the colony, or made their way into Delaware or\r\nPennsylvania. \"The reason why inhabitants leave this province,\" wrote\r\nNicholson, while Governor of Maryland, \"is, I think, the encouragement\r\nwhich they receive from the Carolinas, the Jerseys, and above all from\r\nPennsylvania, which is so nigh that it is easy to remove thither. There\r\nhandicraft tradesmen have encouragement when they endeavor to set up\r\nwoolen manufactures.\"[8-11]\r\n\r\nAlthough this explanation does not go to the root of the matter, it was\r\nin part correct. The northern colonies held out far greater\r\nopportunities for the poor man than the slave choked fields of\r\ntidewater Maryland and Virginia. The industries of Pennsylvania and\r\nDelaware and the Jerseys demanded a certain degree of skill and yielded\r\nin return a very fair living. In other words, the poor settlers in\r\nVirginia, finding that tobacco culture was now based upon the cheap\r\nlabor of African slaves, moved away to other localities where\r\nintelligence still brought an adequate reward.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland House of Delegates, when asked to give their opinion in\r\nthis matter, thought that it was a desire to escape the payment of debts\r\nwhich made some of the \"meaner inhabitants\" seek shelter in Delaware Bay\r\nand the Carolinas. They came nearer the real cause when they added that\r\nthe low price paid by the merchants for tobacco obliged many to\r\nleave.[8-12] Nicholson was not satisfied with this answer. \"They will\r\nnot directly own,\" he wrote, \"that setting up manufactures and\r\nhandicraft-trades in Pennsylvania, the large tracts of land held by some\r\npersons here and the encouragement given to illegal traders are the\r\ncauses that make people leave this province. They would have it that\r\nthey wish to avoid the persecution of their creditors, which causes them\r\nto shelter themselves among the inhabitants of the Lower Counties of\r\nDelaware Bay and of Carolina. The low price of tobacco has obliged many\r\nof the planters to try their fortune elsewhere, and the currency of\r\nmoney in Pennsylvania, which here is not, draws them to that province\r\nfrom this.\"[8-13]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the difficulty of securing desirable land because of the\r\nlarge tracts patented by rich planters was usually assigned as the\r\nreason for the migration of poor families. This view of the matter was\r\ntaken by Edward Randolph, the man who had won the undying hatred of the\r\npeople of Massachusetts by his attempts to enforce the Navigation Acts\r\nthere and by his attacks upon their charter. In 1696 Randolph did\r\nVirginia the honor of a visit, and although encountering there none of\r\nthe opposition which had so angered him in New England, he sent to the\r\nBoard of Trade a memorial concerning the colony, criticising the\r\ngovernment severely. \"It should be inquired into,\" he said, \"how it\r\ncomes to pass that the colony (the first English settlement on the\r\ncontinent of America, begun above 80 years ago) is not better inhabited,\r\nconsidering what vast numbers of servants and others have yearly been\r\ntransported thither.... The chief and only reason is the Inhabitants and\r\nPlanters have been and at this time are discouraged and hindered from\r\nplanting tobacco in that colony, and servants are not so willing to go\r\nthere as formerly, because the members of the Council and others, who\r\nmake an interest in the Government, have from time to time procured\r\ngrants of very large Tracts of land, so that there has not for many\r\nyears been any waste land to be taken up by those who bring with them\r\nservants, or by such Servants, who have served their time faithfully\r\nwith their Masters, but it is taken up and ingrossed beforehand, whereby\r\nthey are forced to hyer and pay a yearly rent for some of those Lands,\r\nor go to the utmost bounds of the Colony for Land, exposed to danger and\r\noften times proves the Occasion of Warr with the Indians.\"[8-14]\r\n\r\nFor their large holdings the wealthy men paid not one penny of quit\r\nrents, Randolph said, and failed to comply with the regulations for\r\nseating new lands. The law demanded that upon receipt of a patent one\r\nmust build a house upon the ground, improve and plant the soil and keep\r\na good stock of cattle or hogs. But in their frontier holdings the\r\nwealthy men merely erected a little bark hut and turned two or three\r\nhogs into the woods by it. Or else they would clear one acre of land and\r\nplant a little Indian corn for one year, trusting that this evasion\r\nwould square them with the letter of the law. By such means, Randolph\r\nadds, vast tracts were held, all of which had been procured on easy\r\nterms and much by means of false certificates of rights. \"Which drives\r\naway the inhabitants and servants, brought up only to planting, to seek\r\ntheir fortunes in Carolina or other places.\"[8-15]\r\n\r\nRandolph suggested that the evil might be remedied by requiring a strict\r\nsurvey of lands in every county, by demanding all arrears of quit rents,\r\nby giving strict orders that in the future no grant should exceed 500\r\nacres. These measures, he believed, would cause 100,000 acres to revert\r\nto the Crown, and \"invite home those who for want of Land left\r\nVirginia.\" It would encourage other persons to come from neighboring\r\ncolonies to take up holdings and \"mightily increase the number of\r\nPlanters.\" This would augment the production of tobacco by many\r\nthousands of hogsheads, stimulate trade and industry in England, and aid\r\nhis Majesty's revenue.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade was deeply impressed. They wrote to Governor Andros\r\nexplaining to him the substance of Randolph's report and asking what\r\nsteps should be taken to remedy the evils he had pointed out. \"But this\r\nseeming to us a matter of very great consequence,\" they added, \"we have\r\nnot been willing to meddle in it without your advice, which we now\r\ndesire you to give fully and plainly.\" But Andros knew full well that it\r\nwas no easy matter to make the large landowners disgorge. The thing had\r\nbeen attempted by Nicholson several years earlier, when suit was\r\ninstituted against Colonel Lawrence Smith for arrears of quit rents upon\r\ntracts of land which had never been under cultivation.[8-16] But before\r\nthe case came to trial Nicholson had been recalled and it was afterward\r\ncompounded for a nominal sum. The proceedings had caused great\r\nresentment among the powerful clique which centered around the Council\r\nof State, and Andros was reluctant to reopen the matter. He knew of no\r\nfrauds in granting patents of land, he wrote the Board, and could\r\nsuggest no remedy for what was past, \"being a matter of Property.\" He\r\nagreed, however, that to limit the size of future patents would tend to\r\n\"the more regular planting and thicker seating of the frontier\r\nlands.\"[8-17]\r\n\r\nConsequently when Francis Nicholson was commissioned as Governor in\r\n1698, he received strict instructions to advise with the Council and the\r\nAssembly upon this matter and to report back to the Board.[8-18] That\r\nnothing was accomplished, however, may clearly be inferred from a letter\r\nof a certain George Larkin written December 22, 1701. \"There is no\r\nencouragement for anyone to come to the Plantation,\" he declared, \"most\r\nof the land lying at all convenient being taken up. Some have 20,000,\r\n30,000 or 40,000 acres, the greater part of which is unimployed.\"[8-19]\r\nTwo years later Nicholson himself wrote that certain recent grants were\r\nfor ten or twenty thousand acres each, so that privileged persons had\r\nengrossed all the good land in those parts, by which means they kept\r\nothers from settling it or else made them pay for it.[8-20]\r\n\r\nDespite all the concern which this matter created, it is doubtful\r\nwhether it was to any appreciable extent responsible for the continued\r\nemigration of poor families. The mere granting of patents for large\r\ntracts of land could not of itself fix the economic structure of the\r\ncolony, could not, if all other conditions were favorable, prevent the\r\nestablishment of small freeholds. Rather than have their fields lie idle\r\nwhile the poor men who should have been cultivating them trooped out of\r\nthe colony, the rich would gladly have sold them in small parcels at\r\nnominal prices. In the first half century after the settlement at\r\nJamestown, as we have seen, such a breakup of extensive holdings into\r\nlittle farms actually occurred. Had similar conditions prevailed in the\r\nlater period a like development would have followed. But in 1630 or\r\n1650, when slaves were seldom employed and when tobacco was high, the\r\npoor man's toil yielded a return so large that he could well afford to\r\npurchase a little farm and make himself independent. In 1680 or 1700, in\r\nthe face of the competition of slave labor, he was almost helpless. Even\r\nhad he found a bit of unoccupied ground to which he could secure a\r\ntitle, he could not make it yield enough to sustain him and his\r\nfamily.[8-21]\r\n\r\nIn 1728 Governor Gooch wrote the Board of Trade that the former belief\r\nthat large holdings of frontier land had been an impediment to\r\nsettlement was entirely erroneous. It was his opinion, in fact, that\r\nextensive grants made it to the interest of the owners to bring in\r\nsettlers and so populate the country. In confirmation of this he pointed\r\nto the fact that Spotsylvania country, where many large patents had been\r\nissued, had filled up more rapidly than Brunswick, where they had been\r\nrestricted in size.[8-22]\r\n\r\nIn the first decade of the new century the emigration out of the tobacco\r\ncolonies continued without abatement. With another disastrous decline in\r\nthe price of tobacco following the outbreak of the wars of Charles XII\r\nand Louis XIV, so many families moved over the border that the Board of\r\nTrade, once more becoming seriously alarmed, questioned the Council as\r\nto the causes of the evil and what steps should be taken to remedy it.\r\nIn their reply the Councillors repeated the old arguments, declaring\r\nthat the lack of land in Virginia and the immunity of debtors from\r\nprosecution in the proprietory colonies were responsible for the\r\nmovement. But they touched the heart of the matter in their further\r\nstatement that the great stream of negroes that was pouring into the\r\ncolony had so increased the size of the tobacco crop that prices had\r\ndeclined and the poor found it difficult to subsist. Not only \"servants\r\njust free go to North Carolina,\" they wrote, \"but old planters whose\r\nfarms are worn out.\"[8-23]\r\n\r\nA year later President Jennings stated that the migration was\r\ncontinuing and that during the summer of 1709 \"many entire families\" had\r\nmoved out of the colony.[8-24] In fact, although but few indentured\r\nservants arrived from England after the first decade of the century,\r\npoor whites were still departing for the north or for western Carolina\r\nso late as 1730. William Byrd II tells us that in 1728, when he was\r\nrunning the dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina, he was\r\nentertained by a man who \"was lately removed, Bag and Baggage from\r\nMaryland, thro a strong Antipathy he had to work and paying his Debts.\"\r\nIndeed he thought it a \"thorough Aversion to Labor\" which made \"People\r\nfile off to North Carolina.\"[8-25]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the numbers involved in this movement, but\r\nthey must have run into the thousands. For a full half century a large\r\nproportion of the white immigrants to Virginia seem to have remained\r\nthere for a comparatively short time only, then to pass on to other\r\nsettlements. And the migration to Virginia during these years we know to\r\nhave comprised not less than thirty or thirty-five thousand persons. In\r\nfact, it would seem that this movement out of the older colony must have\r\nbeen a very important factor in the peopling of its neighbors, not only\r\nwestern Carolina and western Maryland, but Delaware and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThough many thus fled before the stream of negroes which poured in from\r\nAfrica, others remained behind to fight for their little plantations.\r\nYet they waged a losing battle. Those who found it possible to purchase\r\nslaves, even one or two, could ride upon the black tide, but the others\r\nslowly sank beneath it.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the Eighteenth century the poor whites sought\r\nto offset the cheapness of slave made tobacco by producing themselves\r\nonly the highest grades. The traders who dealt in the finest Orinoco,\r\nwhich brought the best prices, found it not upon the plantations of the\r\nwealthy, but of those who tended their plants with their own hands. \"I\r\nmust beg you to remember that the common people make the best,\" wrote\r\nGovernor Gooch to the Lords of Trade in 1731.[8-26]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the wealthy planter, with his newly acquired gangs of slaves,\r\nfound it difficult at this time to produce any save the lower grades of\r\ntobacco. The African was yet too savage, too untutored in the ways of\r\ncivilization to be utilized for anything like intensive cultivation.\r\n\"Though they may plant more in quantity,\" wrote Gooch, \"yet it\r\nfrequently proves very mean stuff, different from the Tobacco produced\r\nfrom well improved and well tended Grounds.\" \"Yet the rich Man's trash\r\nwill always damp the Market,\" he adds, \"and spoil the poor Man's good\r\nTobacco which has been carefully managed.\"[8-27] Thus the small farmer\r\nmade one last desperate effort to save himself by pitting his superior\r\nintelligence against the cheapness of slave labor.\r\n\r\nBut his case was hopeless. As slavery became more and more fixed upon\r\nthe colony, the negro gradually increased in efficiency. He learned to\r\nspeak his master's language, brokenly of course, but well enough for all\r\npractical purposes. He was placed under the tutelage of overseers, who\r\ntaught him the details of his work and saw that he did it. He became a\r\ncivilized being, thoroughly drilled in the one task required of him, the\r\ntask of producing tobacco. Thus the rich planter soon found it possible\r\nto cultivate successfully the higher grades, and so to drive from his\r\nlast rampart the white freeholder whose crop was tended by himself\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nPlaced at so great a disadvantage, the poor man, at all times in very\r\ndifficult circumstances, found it almost impossible to exist whenever\r\nconditions in Europe sent the price of tobacco down. In the years from\r\n1706 to 1714, when the tobacco trade was interrupted by the wars of\r\nCharles XII in the Baltic region and the protracted struggle known as\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession, he was reduced to the utmost\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nVirginia and Maryland were learning that a prosperity founded upon one\r\ncrop which commanded a world market was in unsettled times subject to\r\nserious setbacks. It was a long cry from the James and the Potomac to\r\nthe Baltic ports, yet the welfare of the Virginia and Maryland planters\r\nwas in no small degree dependent upon the maintenance of peaceful\r\nconditions in Poland and Sweden and Russia. A war which seriously\r\ncurtailed the exportation of English leaf to the northern countries\r\nwould inevitably react on the price and so bring misfortune to the\r\ncolonial planters. When called before the Board of Trade to testify as\r\nto the decay of the tobacco trade, the manufacturer John Linton declared\r\nthat the Baltic countries, which formerly had purchased thousands of\r\nhogsheads a year, now took comparatively few. \"The Russian trade is\r\nruined,\" he said.[8-28]\r\n\r\nThe war against France and Spain, coming at this unfortunate juncture,\r\nstill further restricted the market, sent prices down to new depths and\r\nfilled to overflowing the planters' cup of misfortune. \"The war has\r\nstopped the trade with Spain, France, Flanders and part of the Baltic,\"\r\nColonel Quary reported in a memorial to the Board of Trade, \"which took\r\noff yearly 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco. Now our best foreign market is\r\nHolland.\"[8-29] The pamphlet entitled _The Present State of the Tobacco\r\nPlantations in America_ stated, in 1708, that France and Spain alone had\r\nimported 20,000 hogsheads, but that both were now otherwise supplied.\r\n\"The troubles in Sweden, Poland, Russia, etc., have prevented the usual\r\nexportation of great quantities to those ports. Virginia and Maryland\r\nhave severely felt the loss of such exportation, having so far reduced\r\nthe planters that for several years past the whole product of their\r\ntobacco would hardly clothe the servants that made it.\"[8-30]\r\n\r\nTheir misfortunes were accentuated by the fact that the Dutch took\r\nadvantage of the European upheavals to gain control of a part of the\r\ntobacco trade. Upon the outbreak of the war with Louis XIV, England\r\nprohibited the exportation of tobacco either to France or to Spain, but\r\nHolland, despite her participation in the struggle, apparently took no\r\nsuch action. On the contrary she strained every nerve to entrench\r\nherself in the markets of her ally before peace should once more open\r\nthe flood gates to Virginia and Maryland tobacco. With this in view the\r\nacreage in Holland devoted to the cultivation of the leaf was rapidly\r\nextended. \"The Dutch are improving and increasing their tobacco\r\nplantations,\" wrote John Linton in 1706. \"In 1701 they produced only\r\n18,000 hogsheads. Last year it was 33,500 hogsheads.\" Plantations at\r\nNimwegen, Rhenen, Amersfoort and Nijkerk turned out 13,400,000 pounds,\r\nwhile great quantities were raised on the Main, in Higher Germany and in\r\nPrussia.[8-31]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch mixed their own leaf with that of Virginia and Maryland in the\r\nproportion of four to one, subjected it to a process of manufacture and\r\nsent it out to all the European markets.[8-32] In 1707 a letter to John\r\nLinton stated that they had from thirty to forty houses for \"making up\r\ntobacco in rolls,\" employing 4,000 men, besides great numbers of women\r\nand girls. Their Baltic exports were estimated at 12,350,000 pounds;\r\n2,500,000 pounds to Norway, 1,500,000 to Jutland and Denmark, 4,000,000\r\nto Sweden, 2,350,000 to Lapland, 2,000,000 to Danzig and\r\nKönigsberg.[8-33]\r\n\r\nWith the continuation of the war on the continent Dutch competition\r\nbecame stronger and stronger. In 1714, when peace was at last in\r\nprospect, they seemed thoroughly entrenched in many of the markets\r\nformerly supplied by the English. \"The planting of tobacco in Holland,\r\nGermany, Etc.,\" it was reported to the Board of Trade, \"is increased to\r\nabove four times what it was 20 years ago, and amounts now to as much as\r\nis made in both Virginia and Maryland.\" The tobacco trade, which had\r\nformerly produced some £250,000 in the balance of trade, had declined to\r\nabout half that figure, exports of manufactured goods to the Chesapeake\r\nwere rapidly dwindling, the number of ships engaged in carrying tobacco\r\nwas greatly reduced, the merchants were impoverished, the planters were\r\nruined.[8-34]\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly possible to imagine a more miserable spectacle than the\r\npoorer sort of inhabitants in this colony,\" the Council wrote in 1713,\r\n\"whose labour in tobacco has not for several years afforded them\r\nclothing to shelter them from the violent colds as well as heats to both\r\nwhich this climate is subject in the several seasons. The importation of\r\nBritish and other European commodities by the merchants, whereby the\r\nplanters were formerly well supplied with clothing, is now in a manner\r\nwholly left off and the small supplies still ventured sold at such\r\nprodigeous rates as they please. Many families formerly well clothed and\r\ntheir houses well furnished are now reduced to rags and all the visible\r\nmarks of poverty.\"[8-35]\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate period was but temporary. With the conclusion of peace\r\nEnglish tobacco was dumped upon the European market at a figure so low\r\nas to defy competition. And when once the hogsheads began to move, the\r\nreaction on Virginia and Maryland was rapid and pronounced. Soon prices\r\nrose again to the old levels, and the colony entered upon a period, for\r\nthe larger planters at least, of unprecedented prosperity.[8-36] But the\r\neight years of hardship and poverty made a lasting imprint upon the\r\npoorest class of whites. Coming as they did upon the heels of the first\r\ngreat wave of negro immigration, they accelerated the movement of the\r\ndisrupting forces already at work. It was not by accident that the\r\nlargest migration of whites to other settlements occurred just at this\r\ntime and that the inquiries as to its cause are most frequent. The\r\nlittle planter class never fully recovered from the blow dealt it by the\r\ntemporary loss of the larger part of the European tobacco trade.\r\n\r\nThe small freeholders who possessed neither servants nor slaves did not\r\ndisappear entirely, but they gradually declined in numbers and sank into\r\nabject poverty. During the period of Spotswood's administration they\r\nstill constituted a large part of the population. The tax list for 1716\r\nin Lancaster, one of the older counties, shows that of 314 persons\r\nlisted as tithables, 202 paid for themselves only.[8-37] Making ample\r\ndeductions for persons not owning land it would appear that more than\r\nhalf the planters at this date still tilled their fields only with their\r\nown labor. At the time of the American Revolution, however, the\r\nsituation had changed materially, and a decided dwindling of the poor\r\nfarmer class is noticeable. In Gloucester county the tax lists for\r\n1782-83 show 490 white families, of which 320 were in possession of\r\nslaves. Of the 170 heads of families who possessed no negroes, since no\r\ndoubt some were overseers, some artisans, some professional men, it is\r\nprobable that not more than eighty or ninety were proprietors.[8-38] In\r\nSpotsylvania county similar conditions are noted. Of 704 tithable whites\r\nlisted in 1783 all save 199 possessed slaves.[8-39] In Dinwiddie county,\r\nin the year 1782, of 843 tithable whites, 210 only were not slave\r\nholders.[8-40] Apparently the Virginia yeoman, the sturdy, independent\r\nfarmer of the Seventeenth century, who tilled his little holding with\r\nhis own hands, had become an insignificant factor in the life of the\r\ncolony. The glorious promises which the country had held out to him in\r\nthe first fifty years of its existence had been belied. The Virginia\r\nwhich had formerly been so largely the land of the little farmer, had\r\nbecome the land of masters and slaves. For aught else there was no\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the Eighteenth century the condition of the poorest\r\nclass had become pitiable. The French philosopher Chastellux who spent\r\nmuch time in Virginia during the American Revolution testifies to their\r\nextreme misery. \"It is there that I saw poor persons for the first time\r\nsince crossing the ocean,\" he says. \"In truth, near these rich\r\nplantations, in which the negro alone is unhappy, are often found\r\nmiserable huts inhabited by whites whose wan faces and ragged garments\r\ngive testimony to their poverty.\"[8-41]\r\n\r\nPhilip Fithian, in his _Journal_, describes the habits of this class and\r\nis vigorous in his condemnation of the brutal fights which were so\r\ncommon among them. \"In my opinion animals which seek after and relish\r\nsuch odius and filthy amusements are not of the human species,\" he says,\r\n\"they are destitute of the remotest pretension of humanity.\"[8-42] Even\r\nthe negroes of the wealthy regarded these persons with contempt, a\r\ncontempt which they were at no pains to conceal.\r\n\r\nThe traveller Smyth thought them \"kind, hospitable and generous,\" but\r\n\"illiberal, noisy and rude,\" and much \"addicted to inebriety and averse\r\nto labor.\" This class, he says, \"who ever compose the bulk of mankind,\r\nare in Virginia more few in numbers, in proportion to the rest of the\r\ninhabitants, than perhaps in any other country in the universe.\"[8-43]\r\n\r\nBut it must not be imagined that slavery drove out or ruined the entire\r\nclass of small farmers, leaving Virginia alone to the wealthy. In fact,\r\nmost of those who were firmly established remained, finding their\r\nsalvation in themselves purchasing slaves. Few indeed had been able to\r\navail themselves of the labor of indentured servants; the cost of\r\ntransportation was too heavy, the term too short, the chances of\r\nsickness or desertion too great. But with the influx of thousands of\r\nnegroes, the more enterprising and industrious of the poor planters\r\nquite frequently made purchases. Although the initial outlay was\r\ngreater, they could secure credit by pledging their farms and their\r\ncrops, and in the end the investment usually paid handsome dividends and\r\nmany who could not raise the money to buy a full grown negro, often\r\nfound it possible to secure a child, which in time would become a\r\nvaluable asset.\r\n\r\nThis movement may readily be traced by an examination of the tax lists\r\nand county records of the Eighteenth century. In Lancaster even so early\r\nas 1716 we find that the bulk of the slaves were in the hands, not of\r\nwealthy proprietors, but of comparatively poor persons. Of the 314\r\ntaxpayers listed, 113 paid for themselves alone, 94 for two only, 37 for\r\nthree, 22 for four, thirteen for five, while thirty-five paid for more\r\nthan five. As there were but few servants in the colony at this time it\r\nmay be taken for granted that the larger part of the tithables paid for\r\nby others were negro slaves. It would seem, then, that of some 200 slave\r\nowners in this country, about 165 possessed from one to four negroes\r\nonly. There were but four persons listed as having more than twenty\r\nslaves, William Ball with 22, Madam Fox with 23, William Fox with 25 and\r\nRobert Carter with 126.[8-44]\r\n\r\nNor did the class of little slave holders melt away as time passed. In\r\nfact they continued to constitute the bulk of the white population of\r\nVirginia for a century and a half, from the beginning of the Eighteenth\r\ncentury until the conquest of the State by Federal troops in 1865. Thus\r\nwe find that of 633 slave owners in Dinwiddie county in 1782, 95 had one\r\nonly, 66 had two, 71 three, 45 four, 50 five, making an aggregate of\r\n327, or more than half of all the slave holders, who possessed from one\r\nto five negroes.[8-45] In Spotsylvania there were, in 1783, 505 slave\r\nowners, of whom 78 possessed one each, 54 two, 44 three, 41 four, and 30\r\nfive each. Thus 247, or nearly 49 per cent of the slave holders, had\r\nfrom one to five slaves only. One hundred and sixteen, or 23 per cent,\r\nhad from six to ten inclusive.[8-46] The Gloucester lists for 1783 show\r\nsimilar conditions. There were in this country 320 slave holders, having\r\n3,314 negroes, an average of about 10-1/3 for each owner. Fifty had one\r\neach, 41 had two each, 9 had three, 30 had four and twenty-six had five.\r\nThus 156, or about half of all the owners, had from one to five\r\nslaves.[8-47] In Princess Anne county, of a total of 388 slave owners,\r\n100 had one each, 56 had two each and forty-five had three each.[8-48]\r\n\r\nRecords of transfers of land tend to substantiate this testimony, by\r\nshowing that the average holdings at all times in the Eighteenth century\r\nwere comparatively small. In the years from 1722 to 1729 Spotsylvania\r\nwas a new county, just opened to settlers, and a large part of its area\r\nhad been granted in large tracts to wealthy patentees. Yet the deed book\r\nfor these years shows that it was actually settled, not by these men\r\nthemselves, but by a large number of poor planters. Of the 197 transfers\r\nof land recorded, 44 were for 100 acres or less and 110 for 300 acres or\r\nless. The average deed was for 487 acres. As some of the transfers were\r\nobviously made for speculative purposes and not with the intent of\r\nputting the land under cultivation, even this figure is misleading. The\r\naverage farm during the period was probably not in excess of 400 acres.\r\nOne of the most extensive dealers in land in Spotsylvania was Larkin\r\nChew who secured a patent for a large tract and later broke it up into\r\nmany small holdings which were sold to new settlers.[8-49]\r\n\r\nThis substitution of the small slave holder for the man who used only\r\nhis own labor in the cultivation of his land unquestionably saved the\r\nclass of small proprietors from destruction. Without it all would have\r\nbeen compelled to give up their holdings in order to seek their fortunes\r\nelsewhere, or sink to the condition of \"poor white trash.\" Yet the\r\nmovement was in many ways unfortunate. It made the poor man less\r\nindustrious and thrifty. Formerly he had known that he could win\r\nnothing except by the sweat of his brow, but now he was inclined to let\r\nthe negro do the work. Slavery cast a stigma upon labor which proved\r\nalmost as harmful to the poor white man as did negro competition. Work\r\nin the tobacco fields was recognized as distinctly the task of an\r\ninferior race, a task not in keeping with the dignity of freemen.\r\n\r\nJefferson states that few indeed of the slave owners were ever seen to\r\nwork. \"For in a warm climate,\" he adds, \"no man will labour for himself\r\nwho can make another labour for him.\"[8-50] Chastellux noted the same\r\ntendency, declaring \"that the indolence and dissipation of the middling\r\nand lower classes of white inhabitants of Virginia is such as to give\r\npain to every reflecting mind.\"[8-51]\r\n\r\nSlavery developed in the small farmers a spirit of pride and haughtiness\r\nthat was unknown to them in the Seventeenth century. Every man, no\r\nmatter how poor, was surrounded by those to whom he felt himself\r\nsuperior, and this gave him a certain self-esteem. Smyth spoke of the\r\nmiddle class as generous, friendly and hospitable in the extreme, but\r\npossessing a rudeness and haughtiness which was the result of their\r\n\"general intercourse with slaves.\"[8-52] Beverley described them as\r\nhaughty and jealous of their liberties, and so impatient of restraint\r\nthat they could hardly bear the thought of being controlled by any\r\nsuperior power. Hugh Jones, Anbury, Fithian and other Eighteenth century\r\nwriters all confirm this testimony.\r\n\r\nDespite the persistence of the small slave holder it is obvious that\r\nthere were certain forces at work tending to increase the number of\r\nwell-to-do and wealthy planters. Now that the labor problem, which in\r\nthe Seventeenth century had proved so perplexing, had finally been\r\nsolved, there was no limit to the riches that might be acquired by\r\nbusiness acumen, industry and good management. And as in the modern\r\nindustrial world the large corporation has many advantages over the\r\nsmaller firms, so in colonial Virginia the most economical way of\r\nproducing tobacco was upon the large plantations.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy man had the advantage of buying and selling in bulk, he\r\nenjoyed excellent credit and could thus often afford to withhold his\r\ncrop from the market when prices were momentarily unfavorable, he could\r\nsecure the best agricultural instruments. Most important of all,\r\nhowever, was the fact that he could utilize the resources of his\r\nplantation for the production of crude manufactured supplies, thus to a\r\ncertain extent freeing himself from dependence upon British imports and\r\nkeeping his slaves at work during all seasons of the year. Before the\r\nEighteenth century had reached its fifth decade every large plantation\r\nhad become to a remarkable degree self-sustaining. Each numbered among\r\nits working force various kinds of mechanics--coopers, blacksmiths,\r\ntanners, carpenters, shoemakers, distillers. These men could be set to\r\nwork whenever the claims of the tobacco crop upon their time were not\r\nimperative producing many of the coarser articles required upon the\r\nplantation, articles which the poor farmer had to import from England.\r\nFor this work white men were at first almost universally made use of,\r\nbut in time their places were taken by slaves. \"Several of them are\r\ntaught to be sawyers, carpenters, smiths, coopers, &c.,\" says the\r\nhistorian Hugh Jones, \"though for the most part they be none of the\r\naptest or nicest.\"[8-53]\r\n\r\nThe carpenter was kept busy constructing barns and servants' quarters,\r\nor repairing stables, fences, gates and wagons. The blacksmith was\r\ncalled upon to shoe horses, to keep in order ploughs, hinges, sickles,\r\nsaws, perhaps even to forge outright such rough iron ware as nails,\r\nchains and hoes. The cooper made casks in which to ship the tobacco\r\ncrop, barrels for flour and vats for brandy and cider. The tanner\r\nprepared leather for the plantation and the cobbler fashioned it into\r\nshoes for the slaves. Sometimes there were spinners, weavers and\r\nknitters who made coarse cloth both for clothing and for bedding. The\r\ndistiller every season made an abundant supply of cider, as well as\r\napple, peach and persimmon brandy.\r\n\r\nAnd the plantation itself provided the materials for this varied\r\nmanufacture. The woods of pine, chestnut and oak yielded timber for\r\nhouses and fuel for the smithy. The herd of cattle supplied hides for\r\nthe tanner. The cloth makers got cotton, flax and hemp from the\r\nplanter's own fields, and wool from his sheep. His orchard furnished\r\napples, grapes, peaches in quantities ample for all the needs of the\r\ndistiller. In other words, the large planter could utilize\r\nadvantageously the resources at hand in a manner impossible for his\r\nneighbor who could boast of but a small farm and half a score of\r\nslaves.[8-54]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, then, that the widespread use of slave labor would\r\nresult in the gradual multiplication of well-to-do and wealthy men. In\r\nthe Seventeenth century not one planter in fifty could be classed as a\r\nman of wealth, and even so late as 1704 the number of the well-to-do was\r\nvery narrowly limited. In a report to the Lords of Trade written in that\r\nyear Colonel Quary stated that upon each of the four great rivers of\r\nVirginia there resided from \"ten to thirty men who by trade and industry\r\nhad gotten very competent estates.\"[8-55] Fifty years later the number\r\nhad multiplied several times over.\r\n\r\nThus in Gloucester county in 1783, of 320 slave holders no less than 57\r\nhad sixteen or more. Of these one possessed 162, one 138, one 93, one\r\n86, one 63, one 58, two 57, one 56, one 43 and one 40.[8-56] In\r\nSpotsylvania, of 505 owners, 76 had sixteen or more. Of these Mann Page,\r\nEsq., had 157, Mrs. Mary Daingerfield had 71, William Daingerfield 61,\r\nAlexander Spotswood 60, William Jackson 49, George Stubblefield 42,\r\nFrances Marewither 40, William Jones 39.[8-57]\r\n\r\nThe Dinwiddie tax lists for 1783 show that of 633 slave holders, no less\r\nthan 60 had twenty-one or more negroes. Among the more important of\r\nthese were Robert Turnbull with 81, Colonel John Banister with 88,\r\nColonel William Diggs with 72, John Jones with 69, Mrs. Mary Bolling\r\nwith 51, Robert Walker with 52, Winfield Mason with 40, John Burwell\r\nwith 42, Gray Briggs with 43, William Yates with 55, Richard Taliaferro\r\nwith 43, Major Thomas Scott with 57, Francis Muir with 47.[8-58] The\r\nwealth of the larger planters is also shown by the large number of\r\ncoaches recorded in these lists, which including phaetons, chariots and\r\nchairs, aggregated 180 wheels.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the doors of opportunity opened wide to the\r\nenterprising and industrious of the middle class, and many availed\r\nthemselves of it to acquire both wealth and influence. Smyth tells us\r\nthat at the close of the colonial period there were many planters whose\r\nfortunes were \"superior to some of the first rank,\" but whose families\r\nwere \"not so ancient nor respectable.\"[8-59] It was the observation of\r\nAnbury that gentlemen of good estates were more numerous in Virginia\r\nthan in any other province of America.[8-60]\r\n\r\nIn fact the Eighteenth century was the golden age of the Virginia slave\r\nholders. It was then that they built the handsome homes once so numerous\r\nin the older counties, many of which still remain as interesting\r\nmonuments of former days; it was then that they surrounded themselves\r\nwith graceful furniture and costly silverware, in large part imported\r\nfrom Great Britain; it was then that they collected paintings and filled\r\ntheir libraries with the works of standard writers; it was then that\r\nthey purchased coaches and berlins; it was then that men and women\r\nalike wore rich and expensive clothing.\r\n\r\nThis movement tended to widen the influence of the aristocracy and at\r\nthe same time to eliminate any sharp line of demarkation between it and\r\nthe small slave holders. There was now only a gradual descent from the\r\nwealthiest to the poor man who had but one slave. The Spotsylvania tax\r\nlists for 1783 show 247 slaveholders owning from one to five negroes,\r\n116 owning from six to ten inclusive, 66 owning from eleven to fifteen\r\ninclusive, and seventy-six owning more than fifteen.[8-61] In Gloucester\r\n156 had from one to five slaves, 66 from five to ten inclusive, 41 from\r\neleven to fifteen inclusive, and fifty-seven over fifteen. Thus in a\r\nvery true sense the old servant holding aristocracy had given way to a\r\nvastly larger slave holding aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIt is this fact which explains the decline in power and influence of the\r\nCouncil in Virginia, which was so notable in the Eighteenth century.\r\nThis body had formerly been representative of a small clique of families\r\nso distinct from the other planters and possessed of such power in the\r\ngovernment as to rival the nobility of England itself. Now, however, as\r\nthis distinction disappeared, the Council sank in prestige because it\r\nrepresented nothing, while the House of Burgesses became the mouthpiece\r\nof the entire slave holding class, and thus the real power in the\r\ncolonial Government.\r\n\r\nHistorians have often expressed surprise at the small number of Tories\r\nin Virginia during the American Revolution. The aristocratic type of\r\nsociety would naturally lead one to suppose that a large proportion of\r\nthe leading families would have remained loyal to the Crown. Yet with\r\nvery few exceptions all supported the cause of freedom and independence,\r\neven though conscious of the fact that by so doing they were\r\njeopardizing not only the tobacco trade which was the basis of their\r\nwealth, but the remnants of their social and political privileges in the\r\ncolony. When the British Ministry tried to wring from the hands of the\r\nAssembly the all-important control over taxation which all knew to be\r\nthe very foundation of colonial self-government, every planter, the\r\nlargest as well as the smallest, felt himself aggrieved, for this body\r\nwas the depository of his power and the guardian of his interests. A\r\nhundred years before, when the commons rose against the oppression and\r\ntyranny of the Government, the wealthy men rallied to the support of Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley and remained loyal to him throughout all his troubles.\r\nIn 1775 there was no such division of the people; the planters were\r\nalmost a unit in the defense of rights which all held in common.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that slavery worked a profound revolution in the\r\nsocial, economic and political life of the colony. It practically\r\ndestroyed the Virginia yeomanry, the class of small planters who used\r\nneither negroes nor servants in the cultivation of their fields, the\r\nclass which produced the bulk of the tobacco during the Seventeenth\r\ncentury and constituted the chief strength of the colony. Some it drove\r\ninto exile, either to the remote frontiers or to other colonies; some it\r\nreduced to extreme poverty; some it caused to purchase slaves and so at\r\none step to enter the exclusive class of those who had others to labor\r\nfor them. Thus it transformed Virginia from a land of hardworking,\r\nindependent peasants, to a land of slaves and slave holders. The small\r\nfreeholder was not destroyed, as was his prototype of ancient Rome, but\r\nhe was subjected to a change which was by no means fortunate or\r\nwholesome. The wealthy class, which had formerly consisted of a narrow\r\nclique closely knit together by family ties, was transformed into a\r\nnumerous body, while all sharp line of demarkation between it and the\r\npoorer slave holders was wiped out. In short, the Virginia of the\r\nEighteenth century, the Virginia of Gooch and Dinwiddie and Washington\r\nand Jefferson, was fundamentally different from the Virginia of the\r\nSeventeenth century, the Virginia of Sir William Berkeley and Nathaniel\r\nBacon. Slavery had wrought within the borders of the Old Dominion a\r\nprofound and far reaching revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n[1-1] Peter Force, Tracts and Other Papers, Vol. III, A True\r\nDeclaration, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[1-2] Purchas, Vol. XVIII, pp. 437-438.\r\n\r\n[1-3] Peter Force, Tracts and Other Papers, Vol. III, A True\r\nDeclaration, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[1-4] Alexander Brown, The Genesis of the United States, Vol. I, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[1-5] Peter Force, Tracts and Other Papers, Vol. I, Nova Brittania, pp.\r\n21-22.\r\n\r\n[1-6] Hakluyt, Discourse, pp. 89-90.\r\n\r\n[1-7] Hakluyt, Discourse, p. 105.\r\n\r\n[1-8] Hakluyt, Discourse, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[1-9] Hakluyt, Discourse, pp. 14-15.\r\n\r\n[1-10] Alexander Brown, The First Republic in America, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[1-11] Alexander Brown, The Genesis of the United States, Vol. I, p.\r\n349; Peter Force, Tracts and Other Papers, Vol. I, Nova Brittania, pp.\r\n16-17.\r\n\r\n[1-12] Alexander Brown, The Genesis of the United States, Vol. I, p.\r\n239.\r\n\r\n[1-13] Alexander Brown, The Genesis of the United States, Vol. I, p.\r\n202.\r\n\r\n[1-14] P.

Dr. Bruce writes: \"No less an\r\nauthority than Robert Beverley, the historian, states that the\r\nNavigation Acts had a sensible influence in precipitating Bacon's\r\nRebellion. In the early life of this writer he must have been closely\r\nassociated with hundreds of people who had been through the uprising,\r\nand knew much, by direct observation, of the currents that governed it.\r\nThe elder Beverley was thoroughly informed and thus, in his own home,\r\nthe son had the best of opportunities of learning the truth. Beverley\r\nhimself declared that the Acts were causing discontent among the people,\r\nlong before the Rebellion actually occurred, and so did John Bland in\r\nhis memorable petition. There is no doubt that the Acts, by keeping\r\nalive a sense of friction, left the people in just the state of mind to\r\nseize with eagerness on the more palpable wrongs which were specifically\r\nbrought forward as the justification for resistance. It was really the\r\ngroundwork of the movement, though if it had been the only cause, might\r\nnot have precipitated open resistance to the Government.\"\r\n\r\n[5-30] G. L.
