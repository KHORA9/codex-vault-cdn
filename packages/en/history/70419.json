The excuse is, chiefly, the attraction that\r\nthe subject has had for me for at least twenty years, from the time when\r\nit was first taken up as matter of amusement. The difficulty of gaining\r\ninformation, and the inconsistencies of such as I did acquire, convinced\r\nme that the ground was almost untrodden; but the further I advanced on\r\nit, the more I perceived that it required a perfect acquaintance with\r\nlanguage, philology, ethnology, hagiology, universal history, and\r\nprovincial antiquities; and to me these were so many dark alleys, up\r\nwhich I only made brief excursions to knock my head against the wall of\r\nmy own ignorance.\r\n\r\nBut the interest of the subject carried me on—often far beyond my depth,\r\nwhen the connection between names and words has lured me into the realms\r\nof philology, or where I have ventured upon deductions of my own. And I\r\nhave ventured to lay the result of my collections before the public, in\r\nthe hope that they may at least show the capabilities of the study of\r\ncomparative nomenclature, and by classifying the subject, may lead to\r\nits being more fully studied, as an illustration of language, national\r\ncharacter, religion, and taste.\r\n\r\nSurnames and local names have been often discussed, but the Christian\r\nname has been usually considered too fortuitous to be worthy of notice.\r\nCamden did indeed review the current ones of his own day, and gave many\r\ncorrect explanations, chiefly from the German author Luther Dasipodius.\r\nVerstegen followed him up, but was more speculative and less correct;\r\nand since that date (as far as I am aware) no English author has given\r\nany real trustworthy information to the subject, as a subject. A few\r\nlists of names and meanings now and then have appeared in magazines and\r\npopular works, but they have generally been copies of Verstegen, with\r\nchildishly shallow and incorrect additions. One paper which long ago\r\nappeared in _Chambers’ Journal_, was the only really correct information\r\non English names _en masse_ that I have met with.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon names had been, however, treated of by Sharon Turner in\r\nhis history, and Mr. Kemble put forth a very interesting lecture on\r\n_Names, Surnames, and Nicknames among the Anglo-Saxons_. Thierry,\r\nmoreover, gives several explanations, both of Saxon and Frank ones, in\r\nthe notes to his _Conquête d’Angleterre_ and _Récits des Rois\r\nMérovingiens_. These were groundwork. Neither Turner nor Thierry is\r\nalways right, for want of having studied the matter comparatively; but\r\nthey threw light on one another, and opened the way to the dissection of\r\nother names, neglected by them, with the aid of an Anglo-Saxon\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptural class of names was studied with less difficulty. Every\r\nHebrew one has been fully discussed and examined by the best scholars;\r\nand the Greek, both biblical and classical, have received the same\r\nattention, and are in fact the most easy of all, as a class. With regard\r\nto Latin, much must be doubtful and inexplicable, but the best\r\ninformation at present attained to was easily accessible.\r\n\r\nThe numerous race of German appellations has received full attention\r\nfrom many ripe German philologists, and I have made much use of their\r\nworks. The Scandinavian class has been most ably treated by Professor\r\nMunch of Christiania, in a series of contributions to the _Norsk\r\nMaanedskrifts_, of which I have been kindly permitted to make free use,\r\nand which has aided me more than any other treatise on Teutonic\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\nOur Keltic class of names has presented far greater difficulties. for\r\nthe Cymric department, I have gathered from many quarters, the safest\r\nbeing Lady Charlotte Guest’s notes to the _Mabinogion_ and M. de\r\nVillemarqué’s elucidations of King Arthur’s romances, Rees’s _Welsh\r\nSaints_, Williams’s _Ecclesiastical Antiquities_, and Chalmers’s\r\n_Caledonia_; the least safe, Davies’s various speculations on British\r\nantiquities and the _Cambro-Briton_. These verified by Dr. Owen Pugh’s\r\n_Welsh Dictionary_, and an occasional light from Diefenbach and Zeuss,\r\ntogether with a list kindly extracted for me from the _Brut_, have been\r\nmy authorities in the Welsh and Breton departments. In the Erse and\r\nGaelic names I was assisted by a very kind letter from the lamented Dr.\r\nO'Donovan, whose death deprived me of his promised revision of this\r\nextremely difficult class, and left me to make it out to the best of my\r\nability from his contributions to the publications of the Archæological\r\nSociety, from the notes to those of the Ossianic Society, Chalmers’s\r\n_Caledonia_, and the Highland Society’s _Gaelic Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, however, I had perceived that the curiosity of the study\r\ndoes not lie merely in the meanings of the sounds by which men in one\r\ncountry are distinguished from one another. The changes through which\r\nthe word passes is one great interest, and for this I had been\r\ncollecting for years, from dictionaries, books of travels, histories,\r\nand popular tales, whenever people were so good as to give the genuine\r\nword, instead of translating it into English. Dr. G. Michaelis'\r\n_Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der Gebrauchlichsten Taufnamen_ left in me\r\nlittle to desire in this respect, especially with regard to German\r\ndialects, and I have used it copiously.\r\n\r\nThe history of names, however, seemed to have been but little examined,\r\nnor why one should be popular and another forgotten—why one should\r\nflourish throughout Europe, another in one country alone, another around\r\nsome petty district. Some of these questions were answered by history,\r\nsome by genealogy, many more by the tracing of patron saints and their\r\nrelics and legends. Here my great aid has been a French edition of Alban\r\nButler’s _Lives of the Saints_, where, in the notes, are many accounts\r\nof the locality and translations of relics; also, Mrs. Jamieson’s\r\n_Sacred and Legendary Art_, together with many a chance notice in\r\nhistories or books of travels. In each case I have tried to find out\r\nwhence the name came, whether it had a patron, and whether the patron\r\ntook it from the myths or heroes of his own country, or from the meaning\r\nof the words. I have then tried to classify the names, having found that\r\nto treat them merely alphabetically utterly destroyed all their interest\r\nand connection. It has been a loose classification, first by language,\r\nthen by meaning or spirit, but always with the endeavour to make them\r\nappear in their connection, and to bring out their interest.\r\n\r\nIn general I have only had recourse to original authorities where their\r\nmodern interpreters have failed me, secure that their conclusions are\r\nmore trustworthy than my own could be with my limited knowledge of the\r\nsubjects, which could never all be sufficiently studied by any one\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWhere I have given a reference it has been at times to the book whence I\r\nhave _verified_ rather than originally obtained my information, and in\r\nmatters of universally known history or mythology, I have not always\r\ngiven an authority, thinking it superfluous. Indeed, the scriptural and\r\nclassical portion is briefer and less detailed than the Teutonic and\r\nKeltic, as being already better known.\r\n\r\nI have many warm thanks to render for questions answered and books\r\nconsulted for me by able and distinguished scholars, and other thanks\r\nequally warm and sincere to kind friends and strangers who have\r\ncollected materials that have been of essential service to me.\r\n\r\nLastly, let me again present my apologies for my presumption, when the\r\nnecessity of tracing out the source and connections of a word has led me\r\nto wander beyond my proper ken; let me hope that apparent affectations\r\nmay be excused by the requirements of the subject, and express my wish\r\nfor such corrections as may in time render the work far more accurate\r\nand complete. Let it be remembered, that it is the popular belief, not\r\nthe fact, that spreads the use of a name, and that if there is besides\r\nmatter that seems irrelevant, it has been rather in the spirit of\r\nMarmion’s palmers,—\r\n\r\n                      ‘To charm a weary hill\r\n                      With song, romance, or lay.\r\n                  Some ancient tale, or glee, or jest,\r\n                  Some lying legend at the least,\r\n                    They bring to cheer the way.’\r\n\r\n_March 9th, 1863._\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\nAfter one-and-twenty years, I have been able to bring out the revised\r\nedition for which I have long wished, having noted corrections as they\r\nwere kindly sent to me, and as I was able to make them. I am sensible\r\nthat the work is entirely incomplete, and as I have not studied\r\nphilology much in the interval, I fear the book has not gained by the\r\ndelay as much as it ought to have done. But at any rate, many errors\r\nhave been taken out, as well as much that was entirely useless and\r\nirrelevant; and as no subsequent publication has taken quite the same\r\nground, I hope that the present form of the History of Christian Names\r\nmay occupy the niche all the better for the cutting off its\r\nexcrescences. With thanks to the many who have aided in the correction,\r\n\r\n                                                        C. M.

In fact,\r\nwe shall find the history, the religion, and the character of a nation\r\nstamped upon the individuals in the names which they bear.\r\n\r\nIt is to Christian names, properly so called, that our attention will\r\nchiefly be directed. Other names, not acknowledged at any time as\r\nbaptismal, or only given so exceptionally as not to deserve notice, are\r\nhere omitted, or only treated of when their analogy is needed to\r\nillustrate the history of a true Christian name.\r\n\r\nThe original proper names of men and women arose—\r\n\r\nFirst, from some circumstance connected with the birth, such as Esau,\r\nhairy; Jacob, taking by the heel; Agrippa, born with the feet foremost.\r\n\r\nSecondly, from the complexion, _e. g._, Edom, red; Flavius and Fulvius,\r\nyellow; Don, brown; Ruadh, red; Boidh, yellow; Blanche, fair.\r\n\r\nThirdly, from the qualities desired for the child, such as David,\r\nmeaning beloved; the Persian Aspamitas and Greek Philippos, both lovers\r\nof horses; the Keltic Eochaidh, a horseman; the Teutonic Eadgifu, happy\r\ngift; the Slavonic Przemyszl, the thoughtful.\r\n\r\nFourthly, from an animal, Deborah, the bee; Jonah, Columba, Golubica,\r\nthe dove; Zeeb, Lycos, Lupus, Ulf, Yuk, all signifying that strangely\r\npopular wild beast the wolf.\r\n\r\nFifthly, from a weapon, as the Teuton Gar, a spear.\r\n\r\nSixthly, from a jewel, Mote Mahal, in Persian, pearl of the harem; the\r\nGreek, Margarite, a pearl in Greek; the Teutonic Stein, a stone or jewel\r\nin Teutonic.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, religious names, dedicating the child to the Divinity, such\r\nas Ishmael, heard of God; Elijah, God the Lord; and among idolaters,\r\nArtemidorus, gift of Artemis; Jovianus, belonging to Jupiter; Brighid,\r\nthe Irish goddess of smiths and poets; Thorgils, Thor’s pledge.\r\n\r\nTo these we may add a few names of flowers, chiefly borne by women, and\r\nalways indicating a poetical nation, such as Susanna, Lilias, Rhoda,\r\nRose, and the Slavonic Smiljana, the amaranth, a description of name\r\nnever found among the unimaginative Romans.\r\n\r\nAlso a few indicating a time of deep sorrow and distress, when the child\r\nwas born, such as Beriah, son of evil, named when it went ill with his\r\nfather Ephraim; Jabez, sorrow; Ichabod, the glory is departed. These\r\nbeing of ill omen, never prevailed among the joyous Greeks; but among\r\nthe quick-feeling Kelts we find Una, famine, and Ita, thirsty, names\r\nrecording, no doubt, times of sorrow. Also Posthumus and Tristan, though\r\nnot originally bearing the meaning since attributed to them, and\r\nDolores, a name of Spanish Roman Catholic growth, have all been applied\r\nto express the mournful circumstances of some “child of misery, baptized\r\nin tears.”\r\n\r\nNatural defects have likewise furnished names, such as Balbus, the\r\nstammerer; the Irish Dorenn, the sullen; and Unchi, the contentious.\r\nThese are most common among the Romans, owing to their habit of\r\ncontinuing a father’s name, however acquired, to the son. And the Romans\r\nlikewise stand almost alone in their strange and uncomplimentary fashion\r\nof giving individual names from numbers, one in which they have not been\r\nimitated, except now and then, where the number of a family has become\r\nso remarkable as to be deemed worthy of commemoration in the names of\r\nthe younger children. There is, however, said to be a family in Michigan\r\nwhere the sons are called One, Two, Three Stickaway, and the daughters\r\nFirst, Second, Third Stickaway.\r\n\r\nThe invention of original names usually takes place in the early stages\r\nof a people’s history, for a preference soon arises for established\r\nnames, already borne by kindred, and as the spoken tongue drifts away,\r\nfrom the primitive form, the proper name becomes a mere appellative,\r\nwith the original meaning forgotten, and often with a new one\r\nincorrectly applied to it. The names in popular use almost always belong\r\nto a more ancient language than that spoken by the owners; or else they\r\nare imported from some other nation, and adapted to the mouths of those\r\nwho use them. Flexibility of speech is only acquired at a very early\r\nage, and persons who have never spoken any other than their mother\r\ntongue, have no power to catch foreign sounds, and either distort them,\r\nor assimilate them to words of their own. The ear catches the word\r\nimperfectly, the lips pronounce it after their own fashion, and the\r\nfirst writer who hears it, sets it down to the best of his ability, to\r\nbe read, as it may chance, by others, ignorant of the sound the letters\r\nwere meant to represent, and thus striking out absolute novelties. Even\r\nwhere it travels by the medium of writing, the letters of one language\r\nare so inadequate to express the sounds of another, that great changes\r\ntake place in pronunciation, even while the spelling remains unaltered,\r\nand these become visible in the popular contractions.\r\n\r\nThus a foreign conquest, or the fusion of one nation into another, while\r\nintroducing two orders of names to the same country, and in breaking up\r\nand intermixing their original forms of speech, yet leaves untouched the\r\nnames belonging to the old language, though the spoken tongue goes on\r\nliving, growing, and altering.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew is an instance of this process. It was a living tongue up to\r\nthe Babylonish captivity, and constantly formed new names from the\r\nordinary speech of the people; but when the Jews returned they spoke the\r\nAramean dialect; the old Hebrew was dead. They still called their\r\nchildren by mangled and contracted Hebraisms, inherited from their\r\nforefathers, but were in general not aware of their meaning, and were\r\nwilling to give them Greek terminations to suit the literary taste of\r\nthe East. That there was no vigour to throw out new names, is attested\r\nby the very scanty number of Aramean derivation. Yet it is these\r\ncorrupted Hebrew names, marred by Aramean pronunciation, by Greek\r\nwriting, and by the speech of every country, that are the most\r\nuniversally loved and honoured in every Christian land.\r\n\r\nGreek may be said to have never died, and it has, from first to last,\r\nbeen the most vigorous of all languages in creating and spreading names,\r\nwhich are almost all easily explicable. Hellas, though frequently\r\nconquered, has by its glorious literature, both pagan and Christian,\r\ngained wide dominion for its language, and even the present vernacular\r\nof the peasant and sailor is not so decayed but that they can comprehend\r\na line of Homer or a verse of St. John. Thus there is a long list of\r\nGreek names ever new, with comparatively few importations from other\r\ntongues, and for the most part conveying their meaning and augury.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, before Latin was born, the dialects that had produced\r\nLatin names were decaying, and those who, by inheritance, bore the\r\nscanty stock that came down to them, were often at a loss for their\r\nmeaning; nor in general is it so much the names actually borne by\r\nancient Romans, as appellations formed out of the Latin language, that\r\nhave been the Latin contribution to Christian nomenclature. The\r\nuniversal victors chiefly spread Roman names by adopting the conquered\r\nas their clients, and conferring their own nomina when they bestowed the\r\nright of citizenship.\r\n\r\nKeltic still lives in its corners of the world, and its old names have\r\nfor the most part continued in use, but usually each with a name by the\r\nside from some more fashionable tongue, supposed to translate it to the\r\ncivilized ear. For instance, Tadhg, which means, in Erse, a poet, is\r\ncalled in English speech, Teague or Thady; and then further transformed\r\ninto the Aramean Thaddeus (praise); or the Greek Timothy (honour God);\r\nwith an utter loss of the true association.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic names are taken from the elder branches of the Teuton\r\nlanguages, before they became commingled in different degrees with the\r\nlater progeny of Latin, and with one another. We here use the word\r\nTeutonic, because it is the most convenient term by which to express the\r\nclass of languages spoken by the great Germanic family, though we are\r\naware that it is not absolutely correct as a class-appellation including\r\nthe whole. Iceland and Scandinavia use their ancient tongue, but\r\nslightly altered, and there may be found the true forms and\r\ninterpretations of the greater number of the appellations in common use.\r\nModern German continues the old High German, but it is no safe guide to\r\nthe meaning of names which belong to a much earlier form than that in\r\nwhich we now see it, and it has only created a few modern ones of its\r\nown. Anglo-Saxon explains most of its own names, but it cannot be safely\r\ntrusted without comparison with the other branches. It was a language\r\ndeteriorated by the Norman conquest, just as the Norse of the invaders\r\nhad been previously smothered by their conquest of Neustria, and the\r\nEnglish which grew up among them used more of the High Dutch names\r\nadopted by the Normans in France, than of its own Anglo-Saxon ones; and\r\nonly after the Reformation was there an attempt, and that not a very\r\nsuccessful one, at the fabrication of native English names. France kept\r\nDutch names, and clipped them, while High Dutch minced Latin. Lombardy,\r\ntoo, used the old heroic names of the fair-haired barbarians, even while\r\nits speech was constant to the flowing Latin; and Spain has much more of\r\nthe nomenclature than of the tongue of her Goths.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonic has corrupted itself, but become Christian, and has sent a\r\nfew names of great leaders into the general stock of nomenclature, which\r\nhas been formed by contributions from these six original branches, with\r\na few chance additions from other quarters.\r\n\r\nEach nation had a stock of its own at first, but as tribes became mixed,\r\ntheir names were interchanged, and varied by the pronunciation of those\r\nwho adopted them; and when Christianity produced real union, making the\r\nsaint of one country the glory and example of the entire Church, the\r\nnames of the holy and the great became a universal link, and a token of\r\nthe brotherhood established from land to land.\r\n\r\nIt was not at first, however, that this fusion of names commenced. The\r\nfirst Christians were Jews, with Hebrew, Aramean, Greek, or Latin names\r\nof their own, and their converts already bore Greek or Latin\r\nappellations, which were seldom altered. In the case of the Romans,\r\nchildren almost necessarily succeeded to family names, and the Greeks\r\nalone could at first exercise any choice, forming words of Christian\r\nmeaning for their children, or adopting those of their revered\r\ninstructors in the faith; and afterwards, persons using the Latin\r\ntongue, but not encumbered with the numerous names of a citizen,\r\nfollowed their example. The Teutons, when converted, were baptized by\r\nthe names they already bore, and gave the like to their children; nor\r\ndoes it seem to have been till the older forms of the languages were\r\nexpiring, that the introduction of old saintly names became by any means\r\nfrequent. When names were mere appellations, not descriptions, a\r\nfavourite character was sought for in the legends of the saints, and the\r\nchild was dedicated to, or placed under the protection of, the patron\r\nwhose name he bore. The theory was, that the festival in the calendar on\r\nwhich the birth took place, established the claim of the infant to the\r\ncare of the patron, and thus fixed the name, an idea which still\r\nprevails in the Greek Church, but it was more usual to select a\r\nfavourite patron, and instead of keeping the child’s birth-day, to feast\r\nhim upon the holy day of the saint, a custom still observed in Roman\r\nCatholic countries.\r\n\r\nThe system of patron saints was greatly established by the veneration of\r\nrelics. It was the presence of a supposed fragment of the body that was\r\nimagined to secure the protection of the saint to country, to city, to\r\nvillage, or family; and often the ‘translation’ of a relic can be traced\r\nas the cause of the nationality of a name, as the Diego of Spain, the\r\nAndreas of Flanders, the Marco of Venice, the Adrianus of Holland, the\r\nRadegonde of Poitiers, the Anne of Prague. Or the prominence of a fresh\r\ndoctrine is shown in nomenclature, as by the outburst of Scripture names\r\nin all Calvinist countries; so that in French pedigrees, Huguenotism may\r\nbe traced by the Isaacs and other patriarchal apparitions in the\r\ngenealogy, and Puritanism has in England produced the quaint Old\r\nTestament appellations to be found in every parish register. On the\r\nother hand, the increasing devotion to the Blessed Virgin is indicated\r\nby the exaggerated use of Mary in Roman Catholic lands, the epithets\r\ncoupled with it showing the peculiar phases of the homage paid to her,\r\nand almost gauging the amount of superstition in the country.\r\n\r\nReligion has thus been in general the primary guide to individual\r\nnomenclature, and next in order must be ranked the family feeling that\r\nrenders Christian names almost hereditary. In many places where\r\nprimitive customs are kept up, it was an almost compulsory token of\r\nrespect to call the eldest son after his paternal grandfather. This has\r\nindeed been almost universal. The ancient Greeks always did so unless\r\nthe grandfather were alive, in which case the child was thought to take\r\nhis place by bearing his name, and thus to bring death upon him.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland and in the north of England, the paternal grandfather and\r\ngrandmother have namesakes in the eldest son and daughter, then comes\r\nthe turn of the grand-parents on the mother’s side, then of the parents\r\nthemselves, after which fancy may step in. In Germany the same practice\r\nprevails as regards the two eldest; and likewise in the south of France,\r\nwhere the child, whatever its sex, bears the grandfather’s name, thus\r\naccounting for various uncouth feminines; but though thus christened,\r\nthe two eldest children are never so called, but always by the\r\ndiminutive of their surname.\r\n\r\nHowever, distinguished, or wealthy, or beloved godparents interfered\r\nwith these regular successions, and in this manner queens have been the\r\ngreat conductors of female names, bestowing them on their nobility, from\r\nwhom they spread to the commonalty.\r\n\r\nLiterature requires considerable cultivation before it spreads many\r\nnames. It gave some in the latter days of Greece, and more after the old\r\nhereditary customs of Rome were broken up; then, during the dark ages,\r\nits influence was lost, except at Byzantium; and only when the\r\nchivalrous romance became fashionable, did a few poetic knights and\r\ndames call their children after the heroes of the Round Table, or the\r\npaladins of Charlemagne, and then it must have been in defiance of the\r\nwhole system of patron saints until the convenient plan of double names,\r\nfirst discovered by the Germans and French, accomplished the union of\r\nfancy and dedication, or compliment.\r\n\r\nThe revival of learning in the fifteenth century, however, filled Italy\r\nwith classical names, some of which spread into France, and a few into\r\nGermany; but as a general rule in modern times, France, England, and\r\nAmerica have been the countries whose nomenclature has been most\r\naffected by literature; France, especially so, the prevalence of\r\ndifferent tastes and favourite novels being visible from the fifteenth\r\ncentury downwards, through its Arcadian, its Augustan, its Infidel, its\r\nRevolutionary periods; while England, since the Reformation, has\r\nslightly partaken of all these tastes in turn, but with her own\r\nhereditary fashions and religious influences mingling with them; and\r\nAmerica exaggerates every variety in her mixed population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I.\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                          HEBREW NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHebrew, the sacred language, and the medium of all our earliest\r\nknowledge of the world and of man, furnishes almost all of the first\r\nnames known to us, which are in general, verbs, substantives, or\r\nadjectives from that tongue, suggested either by inspiration or by some\r\nof the natural motives observed in the former chapter.\r\n\r\nThe minute history of the naming of the twelve patriarchs, furnish the\r\nbest illustrations of the presaging spirit of early nomenclature.\r\n\r\nReuben, “behold a son,” cries the mother in her first pride; Simeon, “He\r\nthat heareth,” because He had heard her prayer; Levi, a joining, in the\r\ntrust that her husband would be joined with her; Judah, praise, in\r\npraise of Him who had given these four sons, and Judah, “thou art he\r\nwhom thy brethren shall _praise_,” is repeated by Jacob; Dan, a judge,\r\nis so called by his adoptive mother because her cause is judged, “and\r\nDan shall _judge_ his people” is his father’s blessing; Naphtali\r\ncommemorates Leah’s wrestling with her sister; Gad is one of the _troop_\r\nround Leah, “and a _troop_ shall overcome him,” saith Jacob; Asher, is\r\n_blessed_, and Moses cries, “let Asher be blessed;” Issachar, is _hire_;\r\nand Zebulon, a _dwelling_, because Leah hoped her husband would dwell\r\nwith her, and his promise from his father is that he shall _dwell_.\r\nRachel cannot name her long-desired first-born without a craving that\r\nGod would add to her another son, and thus Joseph means an _addition_,\r\nand when that second child was given, and she felt that it was at the\r\ncost of her own life, she mourned over him as Benoni, son of my sorrow;\r\nbut his father with more hopeful augury called him (probably at his\r\ncircumcision) Benjamin, son of my right hand.\r\n\r\nThe earlier names were very simple, such as Leah, weary; Adah, ornament.\r\nBut about the time of the going into Egypt compound words were employed,\r\nfamily names began to grow traditional, and several of Egyptian\r\netymology were acquired.\r\n\r\nThe Aramaic became the Jewish vernacular, and so continued after the\r\nreturn from Babylon, nor has it ceased to prevail, under the name of\r\nSyriac, among a considerable portion of the natives of the East.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Greek invasion of the East, and the establishment of the\r\nMacedonian dynasties of Egypt and Syria, rendered the Grecian the\r\nlanguage of foreign relations and of literature, and caused it to be\r\nunderstood by all who pretended to polite education, or meddled with\r\npolitics and commerce. The Septuagint, or Alexandrian version of the\r\nScriptures, was used in private by the Græcised Jews, and was the form\r\nin which their sacred books became known to those of foreign nations who\r\ntook interest in them.\r\n\r\nThe Roman conquest in like manner brought in a certain amount of\r\ninfluence from the Latin language, though not to the same extent, since\r\nall cultivated Romans were by this time instructed in Greek as part of\r\ntheir education, and even those of inferior rank used it as the medium\r\nof communication with the people of the East.\r\n\r\nThus, in the time of the Gospel history, the learned alone entered into\r\nthe full import of the old Hebrew names, nor were new ones invented to\r\nsuit the occasion, with a very few exceptions, and these few were formed\r\nfrom the vernacular Aramean. The custom was to recur to the old family\r\nnames belonging to ancestors or kindred, and in the account of the\r\ncircumcision of St. John the Baptist we see that a deviation from this\r\npractice excited wonder. Tradition and change of language had, however,\r\ngreatly marred these old Hebraisms; Jehoiadah, (_j_ pronounced _y_,)\r\n(known of God,) had after the captivity lost its significance in the\r\nform of Jaddua, then was Græcized, as Ἱωδαέ, (Hiodae,) and was Latinized\r\nas Jaddeus! These corrupted ancient appellations were the favourites,\r\nbut imitation and compliment caused some Greek ones and even some Latin\r\nones to be adopted, some persons using their national name at home, and\r\nbearing another for their external relations, such as John or Mark, Saul\r\nor Paul.\r\n\r\nThe persons most revered by Christians, and who have had the most\r\ninfluence on nomenclature, thus bore either corrupt Hebrew, or else\r\nAramean, Greek, or Latin names, which all have been handed down to us\r\nthrough the medium of Greek authorship, afterwards translated into\r\nLatin, and thence carried by word of mouth into every Christian land,\r\nand taking shape from the prevalent pronunciation there.\r\n\r\nEastern Christians have gone directly to the Greek; but the Western\r\nChurch used nothing but the Vulgate translated from the Septuagint and\r\nfrom the original New Testament. Thus the Old Testament personages, as\r\nwell as those of the Gospel, were known to mediæval Europe, and are so\r\nstill to the greater part of the continent in their Greco-Latin shape.\r\n\r\nBut King James I. caused his translators to go back to the fountainhead,\r\nusing the original Hebrew and Greek—and only applying to the Septuagint\r\nand Vulgate as means of elucidation, not as authorities. In consequence,\r\nmany of the Old Testament names assumed their original shape, as far as\r\nit could be expressed by English letters, but these were mostly those\r\nbut slightly known to the world, not those of the principal characters,\r\nsince the translators were instructed not to make needless alterations\r\nsuch as should make the objects of ancient veneration appear in a form\r\nbeyond recognition. Therefore it is that some English Old Testament\r\nnames are unlike those of other nations.\r\n\r\nThose who were at work on the New Testament, however, left the ancient\r\nnames, there occurring, as they found them in the Greek, and thus arose\r\nthe disparity we remark in the title given to the same individual, Noah\r\nor Noe, Korah or Core, Uzziah or Ozias.\r\n\r\nFor the most part Old Testament names, as such, have had little\r\nprevalence excepting under the influence of Calvinism. The Roman\r\nCatholic Church neglected them because they did not convey patronage,\r\nand Lutherism has not greatly adopted them, but they were almost a badge\r\nof the Huguenot party in France; and in England, about the latter part\r\nof the reign of Elizabeth, a passion for the most extraordinary and\r\nunusual Scripture names prevailed, for which the genealogist must have\r\ncarefully searched. William L'Isle, in 1623, complains of some “devising\r\nnew names with apeish imitation of the Hebrew,” and in effect there are\r\nfew of these that do not give an impression of sectarianism or\r\nPuritanism. In England and America, the more obscure and peculiar ones\r\nare chiefly adopted by the lower classes; in Ireland several prevail for\r\nanother cause, namely, their supposed resemblance to the native Erse\r\nappellations that were long proscribed by the conquerors.\r\n\r\nThose that were borne by the remnant of faithful Jews, who were the\r\nstock on which the Christian Church was grafted, have gone out into all\r\nlands, infinitely modified by the changes they have undergone in their\r\ntransit from one people to another.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                           PATRIARCHAL NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION I.—_Adam._\r\n\r\nThe oldest of all proper names comes from a word signifying red, and\r\nrefers to the red earth (adama) out of which the first man was taken,\r\nreminding us that dust we are, and unto dust shall we return.\r\n\r\nSome say that it should he translated ‘likeness,’ and that it comes from\r\nthe same root as ‘_adama_,’ red earth, because red earth is always\r\nalike, wherever found. In this case, the first man would have been\r\ncalled from his likeness to his Creator, but the other explanation is\r\npreferable, especially as the same adjective, pronounced with a change\r\nin the vowel sound, so as to make it Edom, was the surname of Esau\r\n(hairy), on account both of the ruddiness of his complexion and of the\r\n_red_ lentile pottage for which he sold his birthright.\r\n\r\nNo Israelites or Jews appear to have been called after our first father,\r\nand the first time Adam comes to light again, is among the Keltic\r\nChristians of Ireland and Scotland. It is not improbable that it was\r\nfirst adopted according to a frequent Gaelic fashion, as the\r\necclesiastical name most resembling the native one of Aedh or fire; but\r\nhowever this may be, there was in the seventh century a distinguished\r\nabbot of Iona, called in the dog Latin of the time, Adamnanus or dwarf\r\nAdam, and best known as Adamnan. Though not recognized by the Roman\r\ncalendar, he was regarded as a saint in his own country, but his name\r\nhas been much corrupted. At Skreen in Ireland, where he founded a\r\nchurch, he is styled St. Awnan, at Raphoe he is patron, as St. Ennan, in\r\nLondonderry he is St. Onan; but in Scotland, Adam has become a national\r\nChristian name. The family who most affected it were the ‘gay Gordons.’\r\n_Edie_ is the Scottish contraction. The feminine _Adamina_ has been a\r\nrecent Scottish invention.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and the neighbouring countries there prevails an idea that\r\nAdam is always long-lived, and if the first infant of a family dies, the\r\nlife of its successor is secured by calling it either Adam or Eve. In\r\nconsequence it has various contractions and alterations. In Lower\r\nLusatia it is _Hadamk_ in familiar speech; the Swiss abbreviation is\r\n_Odli_; the Esthonian _Ado_ or _Oado_, the Lettisu was _Adums_. With its\r\ncontraction, _Ade_, it seems to have been very common at Cambrai through\r\nthe middle ages.\r\n\r\n“The mother of all living”—received from the lips of Adam a name\r\nsignifying life, sounding in the original like _Chavva_, as it began\r\nwith a rough aspirate. It was not copied by any of her daughters for a\r\nlong time, and when first the Alexandrian Jews came on it in their\r\ntranslation, they rendered it by _Zoe_ (life), in order to show the\r\nconnection of the name with the prophecy; but afterwards in the course\r\nof the narrative they merely made it Eva, or in Latin the _Heva_ or\r\n_Eva_, which English has changed into Eve.\r\n\r\nThe Eva of Ireland and Scotland, and the Aveline or Eveline of the\r\nNormans, were probably only imitations of the old Keltic names Aoibhiun\r\nand Aoiffe, and will therefore be considered among the Keltic class.\r\n\r\n_Eve_ has been seldom used in England, though old parish registers\r\noccasionally show a pair of twins christened Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\nThe same notion of securing a child’s life that has spread the use of\r\nAdam in Germany and its vicinity has had the same effect upon his wife,\r\nso that Eva is common in both Germany and Scandinavia. Russia has Evva\r\nor Jevva, though not often as a name in use; the Letts as Ewe or\r\nEwusche; the Lithuanians as Jewa or Jewele, the first letter of course\r\npronounced like _Y_; and in Lusatia her namesakes are called Hejba or\r\nHejbka.[5]\r\n\r\nThe murdered son of Adam is called by a Hebrew word meaning breath,\r\nvapour, or transitoriness, and as some think may have been so termed in\r\nremembrance of his short life. The sound of the original word was more\r\nlike Hebel, but through the Greek we receive it as Abel.\r\n\r\nIt is not absolutely a modern Puritan name, for an Abel existed in Essex\r\nin the time of Henry III., and Awel is known in Russia; but it is\r\ngenerally given direct from the Bible, as are also Seth (appointed), and\r\nEnoch (dedicated).\r\n\r\nAdah (ornament), the wife of Lamech, is often supposed to be the origin\r\nof our English Ada, but this last is the hereditary Latinized form of\r\nEed (rich), and is the same as the German Ida. Zillah (or shadow), the\r\nother wife of Lamech, is a Gypsy name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION II.—_Abi._\r\n\r\nCommon to both the Semitic and Indo-European tongues, and traceable\r\nthrough all their branches, is the parental title first uttered by the\r\ninfant; Abba, Abi, Aba; Atta among the Slavonians, and again among the\r\nGoths; Athair among the Irish, the pater of Greece, fondly called at\r\nhome papa, and apphys the _pater_ of Rome, the German Vater, and our own\r\nfather—_il babbo_ in Italy, and daddy in English cottages.\r\n\r\nIn the East a parent is more usually called the father of his son than\r\nby his own name. This, however, is probably a late affectation, not\r\napplying to the time when the greatest of the patriarchs received his\r\noriginal name of Abram (father of height or elevation), which was\r\nchanged by Divine appointment into Abraham (father of a multitude),\r\nforetelling the numerous and enduring offspring that have descended from\r\nhim, and even to the present hour revere his name.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, seems to have presumed to copy it as long as the\r\nIsraelites dwelt in their own land, and the first resuscitations of it\r\nappear to have been among the Christians of the patriarch’s native land,\r\nMesopotamia, towards the end of the fourth century, when a hermit called\r\nAbraham, living near Edessa, obtained a place in the Coptic, Greek, and\r\nRoman calendars; and about the same time another Abraham was among the\r\nmartyrs who were put to death by the fire worshipping zeal of the\r\nSassanid dynasty in Persia. Two other Mesopotamian SS. Abraham lived in\r\nthe next century, and died, one at Constantinople, the other in\r\nAuvergne, whither in some unaccountable manner he had been carried\r\nbetween foul winds and man-stealing barbarians when on a journey to\r\nvisit the solitaries in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs one of the patrons of Clermont, this Abraham must have been the means\r\nof diffusing namesakes in France, especially on the side towards the Low\r\nCountries. Abraham often occurs in the registers of Cambray; and in\r\ncompliance with the fashion of adapting the name of the father to the\r\ndaughter, Abra was there formed, though apparently not earlier than\r\n1644. Indeed the Netherlands and Holland are the only countries where\r\nthis patriarchal name is really national, generally shortened into Abram\r\nand Bram; and the Dutch settlers carried it into America, where it is\r\ngenerally called either Bram or Aby.\r\n\r\nMany other Scripture names bear this prefix, but it would be contrary to\r\nour plan to dwell upon those that have not been in subsequent use or are\r\ndevoid of peculiar interest.\r\n\r\nAbigail (father of joy), strikes us as inappropriate to a woman, till we\r\nremember that the eastern nations use this expression for an abstract\r\nquality, and that the title would stand for joyfulness. Her ready\r\ncourtesy to David seems to have recommended her to the earliest readers\r\nof the English Bible, for Abigail occurs in registers as early as 1573,\r\nand was for many years very frequent. Abigail Masham’s back-stair\r\ninfluence over Queen Anne has been generally supposed to have rendered\r\nit a soubriquet for a lady’s maid; but Mr. Bardsley, in his _Curiosities\r\nof Puritan Nomenclature_, shows it to have been the name of the waiting\r\ngentlewoman in Beaumont’s Comedy, _The Scornful Ladie_, played in 1616.\r\nAnd in a play of Killigrew’s, some thirty years later, the term\r\n‘Abigail’ is used for a waiting-maid, when the back-stair influence and\r\nsupposed arts of Abigail Masham in the bedchamber of Queen Anne gave it\r\na sudden fall. Abigail turned into a cant term for a lady’s maid, and\r\nthenceforth has been seldom heard even in a cottage.\r\n\r\nCounter to his name was the course of the “Father of Peace.” He is\r\nAbishalom, or Absalom in the narrative of his life, a history that one\r\nwould have thought entailed eternal discredit on the name; but it seems\r\nthat in the earlier Christian times of Denmark, as well as in some other\r\ncountries, a fashion prevailed, especially among the clergy, of\r\nsupplementing the native name with one of Scriptural or ecclesiastical\r\nsound, and thus, about the middle of the twelfth century, Absalom was\r\nadopted by a distinguished Danish bishop as the synonym of what\r\nProfessor Munch conjectures to have been his own name of Aslak (reward\r\nof the gods), though Danish tradition has contracted it into Axel. This\r\nlast is a national Danish name, and it seems as if Absalom had been\r\npopularly supposed to be the Latin for Axel; since, in a Latin letter of\r\n1443, Olaf Axelsson is turned into Olaus Absalonis.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this prefix Ab, it seems to be the place to remark upon\r\na name coming to us through the Tartar stock of languages, from the same\r\nsource—Ab. Ata, (father, the source of Atalik, fatherlike or paternal,)\r\nis to the present day a title among the Usbeks of Bokhara. Thence that\r\nregent of the Huns, the scourge of God, who spread terror to the gates\r\nof Rome, would have been called Attalik among his own people, and thus\r\nhistorians have written his name of terror Attila.\r\n\r\nIn the tales of the Nibelungen, the great Hun, whom Kriemhild marries\r\nafter the death of Siegfried, and at whose court the general slaughter\r\ntakes place, is called Etzel in the German poem, Atli in the Northern\r\nsaga, and this has generally been regarded as identifying him with\r\nAttila and fixing the date of the poem; but the monarch of the Huns is\r\nhospitable and civilized, with few features in common with the savage of\r\nRoman history; and if Attalik were a permanent regal title among the\r\nHuns, the chieftain may have been any other of the royal dynasty. His\r\noccurrence in that favourite poem, sung alike by all the Teutonic race,\r\nhas rendered Atli very common from early times in the North as well as\r\nEtzel in Germany. The Lombards took it to Italy, where it turned into\r\nEccelino, and in the person of the fierce mountain-lord, Eccelino di\r\nRomagna, became as fearful as Attila had ever been to the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe verb to fight or to rule furnished both the names of the wife of\r\nAbraham; Sarai (quarrelsome) was thus converted into Sarah (the\r\nprincess). If we may judge from the example of the bride of Tobias, the\r\ndaughters of Sarah were occasionally called by her name, and Zara has\r\nbeen, with what correctness I know not, used as an eastern name.\r\n\r\nSarah now and then occurs in England, as with Sara Beauchamp, (_temp._\r\nEd. I.,) but I suspect that she as well as Sarrota de Multon, who lived\r\nin the former reign, were alterations of some of the derivatives of the\r\nTeutonic prefix _Sig_—victory, as the masculine Saher or Serlo certainly\r\ncame from Sigeheri. Sarah was never commonly used till after the\r\nReformation, when it began to grow very popular, with its contraction\r\nSally; and at the same time it was adopted as the equivalent for no less\r\nthan three Irish names—Sadhbh (pronounced Soyv), Sorcha (bright), and\r\nSaraid (excellent). The two first are still in use; but Highlanders make\r\na still stranger use of Sarah, which they use to translate their native\r\nMore (great), perhaps in consequence of its meaning.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the name is occasionally used without the _h_ that our\r\nbiblical translators gave it. It is not, however, very popular, though\r\nthe French have used it enough to make it Sarotte; in Illyria its\r\ndiminutive is Sarica; in Lithuania it is Zore.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen the first glad tidings of the Child of Promise were announced,\r\nSarah laughed for very joy and wonder, and Laughter (Yizchak) became the\r\nname of her son; known in Greek as Ἰσαὰκ, in Latin and to the European\r\nworld as Isaac.\r\n\r\nIt was not revived among the early Jews; but, like Abraham, it was used\r\nby the eastern Christians, and St. Isaac, bishop of Beth Seleucia, was\r\nput to death with other Christian martyrs by Sapor II. of Persia.\r\nAnother eastern Isaac was a hermit at Spoleto, in the sixth century, and\r\nIsaak has always been a favourite name in the Greek Church. Several of\r\nthe family of Comnenus, both at Constantinople and Trebizond, rendered\r\nIsaak a royal name; and Isaak or Eisaak, whose feast falls on the 30th\r\nof May, is the patron of the cathedral at Petersburg. The name is\r\nfrequently used in Russia and the other Greco-Slavonic countries, though\r\nnot much varied.\r\n\r\nIt had not much favour in the West, though it appears once in Domesday\r\nBook, and occurs in the Cambray registers. Mr. Bardsley thinks that it,\r\nwith some other Patriarchal names, became familiar through Mystery\r\nplays. But its chief popularity was after the Reformation, when it is\r\ncontinually to be found among the Huguenots, and it seems to have passed\r\nfrom them to other French families, since it is sometimes found in\r\npedigrees, and the noted de Sacy, a grandson of the Arnauld family, was\r\nthus christened long after his forefathers had conformed to the Roman\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nWith us Izaak, as our ancestors spelt it, is just so prevalent among us\r\nas to have a recognized contraction, Ike or Ikey.\r\n\r\nIsaac’s wife was called from _rabak_ (to bind). The word Ribkâ meant a\r\ncord with a noose, and probably was given as conveying the firmness of\r\nthe marriage bond. The Septuagint and Latin gave Rebecca; the authorized\r\nversion Rebekah; and both spellings are adopted by those bearing the\r\nname, who are generally called Becky.\r\n\r\nHere too should be mentioned the faithful nurse of Rebekah, who was so\r\nlamented that the tree beneath which she was buried was known as the oak\r\nof weeping. Her name of Deborah came from a verb meaning to hum or buzz,\r\nand signified a bee, or, in after times, eloquent.\r\n\r\nDeborah found no favour as a name except among English Puritans, and has\r\nacquired a certain amount of absurdity from various literary\r\nassociations, which prevent ‘Deb.’ from being used except by the\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\nOf Rebekah’s two daughters-in-law, Rachel signified a ewe.\r\n\r\nDante made _l’antica Rachele_, with her beautiful eyes, the type of\r\nheavenly contemplation, ever gazing at the mirror that reflected\r\nheavenly glory; but her name was not popular, although the Manx\r\nprincess, otherwise called Affrica, assumed it upon her marriage with\r\nSomerled, Lord of the Isles, somewhere about the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nBut Puritan days loved the sound of the word, and “that sweet saint who\r\nsat by Russell’s side” has given it a place in many an English family.\r\nPolish Jews call it Rahel; in which form it was borne by the\r\nmetaphysical lady who became the wife of Varnhagen von Ense.\r\n\r\n             ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐\r\n             │   English.   │   German.    │  Bavarian.   │\r\n             │Matthias      │Matthæus      │Mathies       │\r\n             │Mathies       │Matthew       │Mahe          │\r\n             │Mat           │Matthes       │Hies          │\r\n             │              │Matthis       │Hiesel        │\r\n             │              │              │Mathe         │\r\n             ├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n             │    Swiss.    │Swedish.      │   Danish.    │\r\n             │Mathias       │Mathias       │Mathias       │\r\n             │Thies         │Mats          │Mads          │\r\n             │Thiesli       │              │              │\r\n             ├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n             │  Friesland.  │   French.    │   Italian.   │\r\n             │Matthies      │Matthieu      │Matteo        │\r\n             │Hise          │Macé          │Maffeo        │\r\n             │Hisse         │              │Feo           │\r\n             │              │              │Mattia        │\r\n             ├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n             │   Spanish.   │   Russian.   │   Polish.    │\r\n             │Mateo         │Matfei        │Mateusz       │\r\n             │              │Matvej        │Maciei        │\r\n             │              │              │Maciek        │\r\n             │              │              │Matyas        │\r\n             ├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n             │  Hungarian.  │   Slovak.    │  Esthonian.  │\r\n             │Matyas        │Matevz        │Maddis        │\r\n             │Mate          │Tevz          │Mats          │\r\n             │              │Mattija       │              │\r\n             └──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\nRachel’s less beloved and less favoured sister had a name that came from\r\n_lawah_ (hanging upon, dependence, or, as in her case it is explained,\r\nweariness)—Leah, in French Lea, in Italian Lia, under which title Dante\r\nmakes her the emblem of active and fruitful, as is her sister of\r\nmeditative, love. It was from the same word that she named her third son\r\nLevi, when she hoped that her husband would be more closely united or\r\ndependent on her. Levi’s name was carried on into the Gospel times, and\r\nbelonged to the publican who was called from the receipt of custom to\r\nbecome an Apostle and an Evangelist. His Aramean name was, however, that\r\nby which he calls himself in his own narrative, or more correctly\r\nspeaking, by its Græcized form. The old Hebrew Mattaniah (gift of the\r\nLord) was probably the origin of both the names that we have in the\r\nGreek Testament as Ματθαῖος and Ματθίας, Matthæus and Matthias as the\r\nLatin renders them. Some, however, make the first mean a faithful man;\r\nbut it is not possible to distinguish between the various forms that\r\nhave risen out of the two among persons who, probably, had no idea that\r\nthe Apostle who supplied the place of Judas was a different person from\r\nthe Evangelist. The Emperor Charles V. was born on St. Matthias' day,\r\nand the text “The lot fell on Matthias” was regarded as a good augury,\r\nwhence Matthias came into favour in Austria and its dependencies. The\r\nname has been more popular in Germany and its dependencies. Matteo heads\r\nthe Milanese Visconti, who were mostly named after the Evangelists.\r\n\r\nApostolic names are particularly common in Bavaria, probably from the\r\nonce frequent representations of the Mystery of the Passion. In Germany,\r\nSS. Matthew and Matthias have produced the surnames Matthies, Matys,\r\nThiess, and Thiessen, Latinized after a queer scholarly fashion into\r\nThysius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION III.—_Jacob._\r\n\r\nThe twin sons of Isaac and Rebekah were called from the circumstances of\r\ntheir birth, Esau, the hairy, and Ja’akob, the latter word being derived\r\nfrom _âkêb_, the heel, because in the words of the Prophet “he took his\r\nbrother by the heel in the womb.” This, the action of tripping up,\r\nconfirmed the mother’s faith in the previous prediction that “the elder\r\nshould serve the younger,” and thus that the younger should supplant the\r\nelder. “Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he hath _supplanted_, me\r\nthese two times,” was accordingly the cry of Esau.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the return from Babylon we find two if not three persons\r\nmentioned as bearing the name of Akkub, and that this was meant for\r\nJacob, is shown by its etymology; as it likewise means the supplanter,\r\nby its likeness in sound to Yacoub, the form still current among the\r\nArabs, and by the fact that the Akkub, who in the book of Nehemiah\r\nstands up with Ezra to read the law to the people, is in the book of\r\nEsdras, written originally in Greek, called Ἰάκοβος (Jakobos).\r\n\r\nSo frequent was this Jakobos among the returned Jews that it occurs in\r\nthe royal genealogy in St. Matthew’s Gospel, and was borne by two of the\r\ntwelve apostles, by him called the Great, who was the first to be\r\nmartyred, and by him termed the Less, who ruled the Church at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIt is the Great Apostle, the son of Zebedee, who is the saint, in whose\r\nhonour most of those bearing this name in Europe have been christened. A\r\nbelief arose that he had preached the Gospel in Spain before his\r\nmartyrdom at Jerusalem; and though there was no doubt that the Holy City\r\nwas the place of his death, yet it was declared that his relics were\r\nbrought to Galicia in a marble ship without oar or sail, which arrived\r\nat the port of Aria Flava, since called Patron. A little farther inland\r\narose what was at first termed in Latin the shrine of Sanctus Jacobus\r\nApostolus. Men’s tongues quickly turned this into Sancto Jacobo\r\nApostolo, and thence, confounding the title with the place, arrived at\r\nSanto Jaco de Compostella, or Santiago de Compostella.\r\n\r\nA further legend arose that in the battle of Clavijo with the Moors, the\r\nspirits of the Christian Spaniards were revived by the sight of Santiago\r\nmounted on a white steed, waving a white banner, and leading them on to\r\nvictory. Thenceforth Santiago became their war-cry, and the saint was\r\ninstalled as a champion of Christendom. Subsequently no less than three\r\nSpanish orders of knighthood were instituted in his honour, and his\r\nshrine became one of the most universal places of pilgrimage in Europe,\r\nmore especially as the most marvellous fables of miracles were forged\r\nthereat. His saintly title had become so incorporated with his name that\r\nhis votaries were in some perplexity where to separate them, and in\r\nCastille his votaries were christened Tiago or Diego. Even as early as\r\nthe tenth century the Cid’s father was Don Diego de Bivar, and he\r\nhimself Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar, Diaz being the patronymic.\r\n\r\nIn 1207, Maria, Queen of Aragon, considering her infant son and heir to\r\nhave been granted at the especial intercession of the twelve apostles,\r\nresolved to baptize him after one of their number, and impartially to\r\ndecide between them by naming twelve tapers after the apostles, and\r\ncalling the child after him whose candle burnt longest. Southey has\r\ncomically described the Queen’s agitations until the victorious candle\r\nproved to be that of the great Saint of Galicia, whom Aragonese tongues\r\ncalled Jayme. The child thus christened became the glory of his kingdom,\r\nand was known as El Conquestador, leaving Jayme to be honourably borne\r\nby Kings of Aragon, Majorca, and Sicily as long as his family remained\r\ndistinct. Giacopo Apostolo was the Italian version of the name, whence\r\nthey made their various Giacopo, Jacopo, Giacomo, Como, Iachimo, and\r\nIago according to their various dialects. Germany recurred to the\r\noriginal Jakob; but the French coming home with their own variety talked\r\nof Jiac Apostol, and named their children Jacques, or fondled them as\r\nJacquot and Jacqueminot. The great church of St. Jacques, at Liège,\r\nspread the love of the name in Flanders as is testified by Jacob von\r\nArteveldt, the Brewer of Ghent; and so universal throughout France was\r\nit, that Jacques Bonhomme became the nickname of the peasantry, and was\r\nfearfully commemorated in the Jacquerie, the insurrection of which\r\nEnglish chroniclers supposed James Goodman to have been the leader. It\r\nmust have been when English and French were mingled together in the\r\ncamps of the Black Prince and Henry V. that Jack and Jock became\r\nconfounded together. Henry V. called the wild Jacqueline of Hainault,\r\nDame Jack. She, like his other Flemish sister-in-law, Jacquette of\r\nLuxemburg, must have been named in honour of the saint of Liège. Edward\r\nVI.’s nurse, whom Holbein drew by the soubriquet of Mother Jack, was\r\nperhaps a Jacquette; Iacolyn and Jacomyn are also found in old\r\nregisters, but this feminine never took root anywhere but in France,\r\nwhere Jacobée also occurs. James had found its way to Scotland ere the\r\nbirth of the Black Douglas, and was already a national name before it\r\nwas given to the second son of Robert III., in accordance with a vow of\r\nthe queen. This James was brought to the throne by the murder of his\r\nbrother David, Duke of Rothsay; and thus was the first of the royal\r\nStuarts, by whom it was invariably borne till the sixth of the line\r\nhoped to avert the destiny of his race by choosing for his sons more\r\nauspicious names. James and Jamie thus became great favourites in\r\nScotland, and came to England with the Stuarts. The name had indeed been\r\npreviously used, as by the brave Lord James Audley under Edward III.,\r\nbut not so frequently, and the old English form was actually Jeames.\r\nNorden dedicates his _Survey of Cornwall_ to James I. as Jeames; and\r\nArchbishop Laud so spells the word in his correspondence. In fact, Jemmy\r\nand Jim are the natural offsprings of Jeames, as the word was pronounced\r\nin the best society till the end of the last century. Then the gentry\r\nspoke according to the spelling; Jeames held his ground among the lower\r\nclasses, and finally—thanks to _Jeames’s Diary_—has become one of the\r\nstock terms of conventional wit; and in modern times Jacobina and\r\nJamesina were coined for female wear.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders call the name Hamish; the Irish, Seumuis. In fact, its\r\nvariations are almost beyond enumeration. In Italy the full name has the\r\nthree varieties, Giacomo, Jacopo, Giacobbe, so no wonder the\r\nabbreviations are Coppo and Lapo.\r\n\r\nDue honour is paid in the Greek and Slavonic Church to both the\r\nveritable apostles, but not to the mythical Santiago de Compostella,\r\nwhom we have traced as the root of all the Jameses of the West.\r\n\r\nThe great Jakobos, who appeared at the Council of Nicea, and gloriously\r\ndefended the city of Nisibis, handed on the apostolic name in the East;\r\nand it has almost as many Greek and Slavonian variations as Latin and\r\nTeutonic ones.\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐\r\n │  English.   │   Scotch.   │    Erse.    │   Gaelic.   │   Dutch.    │\r\n │Jacob        │James        │Seumuis      │Hamish       │Jacob        │\r\n │James        │Jamie        │             │             │Jaap         │\r\n │Jem          │             │             │             │             │\r\n │Jemmy        │             │             │             │             │\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤\r\n │   French.   │   German.   │   Swiss.    │  Italian.   │  Spanish.   │\r\n │Jacob        │Jakob        │Jakob        │Jacopo       │Jacobo       │\r\n │Jacques      │Jackel       │Bopp         │Iachimo      │Santiago     │\r\n │Jacquot      │Jockel} Bav. │Jock         │Giakobbe     │Diego        │\r\n │Jacqueminot  │Gaugl }      │Jogg         │Coppo        │Yago         │\r\n │             │             │Jagli        │Lapo         │Jago         │\r\n │             │             │             │Jacobello    │Jayme        │\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤\r\n │ Portuguese. │   Russian.  │   Polish.   │    Lett.    │             │\r\n │Jayme        │Jakov        │Jakob        │Jekups       │             │\r\n │             │Jascha       │Kuba         │Jeka         │             │\r\n │             │Jaschenka    │Kub          │Jezis        │             │\r\n │             │             │             │Kubischu     │             │\r\n └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Russian nameday is the 30th of April, either for the sake of St.\r\nJames the Less, whose eve it is, or for that of a namesake who perished\r\nin Numidia in the time of Valerian, and whose feast falls on that day.\r\nJakov gets called Jascha and Jaschenka, and his feminine Jacovina and\r\nZakelina.

St. James, in his discourse at\r\nJerusalem, called St. Peter ‘Simeon,’ and it would thus seem likely that\r\nthis was used as their true national name, and that Simon was a Græcism\r\nused in intercourse with strangers, or in writing.\r\n\r\nThe anchorite who took that strangest freak of fanaticism, the perching\r\nhimself for life upon a column, is called both Simeon and Simon\r\nStylites, but the latter form has generally been the prevalent one, and\r\nhas belonged to numerous saints in both the Eastern and Western Church.\r\nThe Greek Church has both St. Seeméön on the 3rd of February, and St.\r\nSsimon on the 10th of May, and the Russian contractions are Ssemen and\r\nSsenka. The West, too, had sundry Simons of its own, besides those\r\ncommon to all Christendom. We had a monastic St. Simon Stock, and though\r\nthe Christian name is now uncommon, it has left us many varieties of\r\nsurnames, as Simmonds, Simkins, Simpson, Simcoe, Sykes, etc., the\r\nspelling but slightly varied. It was more used among the French\r\npeasantry, and acquired the feminine Simonette. The Italian Simone was\r\nnot unfrequent, and has made the surname Simoncelli; the Portuguese had\r\nSima; the Spaniards, Ximon; and the Slavonians have the odd varieties of\r\nthe Polish Szymon, the Illyrian Simej, the Lusatian Schymanz.\r\n\r\nIt is the same word Schama that named the first of the prophets of\r\nIsrael. “Asked of God” is the import of Samuel, a name so endeared by\r\nthe beautiful history of the call to the child in the temple, that it\r\ncould not be quite forgotten. A Samuel, native of Palestine, who\r\nperished in the persecution of Maximian, obtained a martyr’s place in\r\nthe calendar, and his name has been a favourite in the Eastern Church,\r\nas Samuil, Samoilo, in Russia; Schombel in Lusatia; Zomelis in\r\nLithuania. The reading of the Holy Scriptures was, however, no doubt,\r\nthe cause of its use here and in Switzerland, since we scarcely find it\r\nbefore the Reformation, though now Samuel is common in Switzerland, and\r\nSam here.[8]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Butler; Lower’s _English Surnames_;\r\n  Michaelis; Piot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION V.—_Judah._\r\n\r\nIn her exultation at having borne so many promising sons, Leah called\r\nher fourth Jehudah (he will be praised); meaning brought forward by her\r\nhusband Jacob when, in his death-bed blessing of his sons, he exclaimed,\r\n“Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise.”\r\n\r\nThus, too, it has been with the individual name of Judah. Unused before\r\nthe captivity, it was revived again after it, and carried to the highest\r\nfame and popularity by the brave Maccabee, who newly founded Judea and\r\nrestored it, for a time, to freedom and honour. His surname is by some\r\nderived from a word meaning the Hammerer, by others from Makkabi, formed\r\nby initial letters of the motto on his standard, “Who among the gods is\r\nlike unto Thee, O Lord?” Judas Maccabeus, early as was his death, and\r\nimperfect as was the deliverance of his country when he was slain, was\r\none of the chief heroes of the world, and occupied a far larger space in\r\nthe imagination of our mediæval ancestors than he does in ours. Not only\r\nwere the books of Maccabees considered as of equal authority with the\r\ncanonical Scriptures, but, before 1240, a French metrical romance had\r\nrecounted his exploits, and by Chaucer’s time Judas Maccabeus was ranked\r\namong the nine worthies—the subject of many a ballad and chap-book.\r\n\r\nBut his name has never occurred! Frequent, indeed, it was among his own\r\ncountrymen after his time, but of them was that man who rendered it for\r\never accursed.\r\n\r\nAnother apostle bore the same name, but this did not suffice to redeem\r\nit, though altered into Jude to mark the distinction. The Saint had,\r\nhowever, two Aramean names, Lebbæus, supposed to mean hearty, or else\r\nfrom the town of Lebba, and Thaddæus, which is satisfactorily explained\r\nas an Aramean form of the same word Praise, Græcized and Latinized of\r\ncourse before it came to us.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, popular. Italy has indeed used it a good deal as\r\nTaddeo, and Spain knows it as Tadeo; but though Ireland swarms with\r\nThadys, who write themselves Thaddeus, this is only as a supposed\r\nEnglish version of their ancient Erse, Tadhg (a poet). The Slavonic\r\nnations use it more than the West; it is a favourite Polish name, and\r\nthe Russians call it Phaddéi; and the Illyrians, Tadia. No name has been\r\nso altered as Judah; it is Hodaiah after the captivity, and Abiud, or\r\nrather Ab-jud, in St. Luke’s genealogy.\r\n\r\nThe feminine form of the name, Jehudith, or Judith, belonged primarily\r\nto the Hittite wife of Esau, who was a grief of heart to Rebekah, but\r\nits fame is owing to the heroine of Bethulia, whose name is, however,\r\nsaid rather to mean a Jewess than to be exactly the feminine of Judah.\r\nIndeed some commentators, bewildered by the difficulties of chronology,\r\nhave supposed the history to be a mere allegory in which she represents\r\nthe Jewish nation. However, on the uncritical mind of the eighth or\r\nninth century, her story made a deep impression, and a poem was in\r\ncirculation in Europe recording her adventurous deed, and mentioning\r\namong the treasures of Holofernes' tent a mosquito net, whence the\r\nlearned argue that the narrative must have been derived from some\r\neastern source independent of the Apocryphal book.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, hers was the first name not belonging to their own language\r\nthat was borne by Teutonic ladies, and long preceded that of any saint.\r\nPerhaps it was supposed to be the equivalent of the German Juthe from\r\nGanthe, war; at any rate Juditha, Jutha, or Jutta was in high favour at\r\nthe court of the Karling Kaisers, and came to England with the\r\nstep-mother, who gave the first impulse to our great Alfred’s love of\r\nlearning. Her subsequent marriage took it to Flanders, and we had it\r\nback again with the niece of William the Conqueror, the wicked wife of\r\nWaltheof, and afterwards of Simon de St. Lis. Her uncle cites her as a\r\nwitness to a charter by the familiar abbreviation of Jugge, which was\r\nlong used as the regular contraction, though Judy has since become more\r\nusual, and is exceedingly common in Ireland.\r\n\r\nEven French families gave their daughters the name of Judith, which\r\nbelonged to the gentle Comtesse de Bonneval. The Breton form is Juzeth;\r\nand the Swiss ruthlessly turn it into Dith, but across the Alps it comes\r\nforth more gracefully as Giuditta; and the Poles make it Jitka; the\r\nHungarians, Juczi or Jutka.\r\n\r\nOn the authority of Eusebius we venture to add a third to those who bore\r\nthe name of Judah in the apostolic college, namely, him whom we know by\r\nthe Aramaic and Greek epithets Thomas and Didymus, both meaning a twin.\r\nTradition declares that his fellow-twin was a sister called Lysia. India\r\nis believed to have been the region of his labours and of his death; the\r\nChristians there were called after him; and when, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the Portuguese attained their object of reaching India by sea,\r\nthey thought they discovered his tomb at Meliapore, transported the\r\nrelics to Goa, and created San Tomàs or Tomè into their patron saint.\r\nLong ere this, however, in every part of Europe had Thomas been revived\r\nwith other apostolic names, but its great prominence was derived from\r\nthe murdered Archbishop Becket, or St. Thomas of Canterbury. His shrine\r\nat Canterbury was the English Compostella, visited by foreign as well as\r\nnative pilgrims, and the greater proportion of churches so termed were\r\nunder the invocation of the archbishop instead of the apostle, although\r\nit is only by charter or by wake-day that the dedication can be traced,\r\nsince Henry VIII. did his utmost to de-canonize and destroy all\r\nmemorials of the bold prelate whom he would most certainly have beheaded\r\ninstead of assassinating. In Italy a martyr for ecclesiastical\r\nprerogatives was certain to be in high repute; carvings, glass,\r\npaintings, and even needlework still bear his history and figure, always\r\ndenoted by the clean cutting off of his scalp above the tonsure, and\r\nTomasso flourishes greatly as a Christian name, the Italians, as usual,\r\nabbreviating by the omission of the first syllable instead of the last,\r\nso that where we say Tom, they say Maso, and thence Masuccio, as we call\r\none of their earliest great painters. Tomasso Agnello was the true name\r\nwhich, contracted into Masaniello, was the wonder of the day at Naples,\r\nand made the Spanish power there totter on its throne.\r\n\r\nThe feminine Thomassine, Tamzine, and Tammie, are comparatively recent\r\ninventions. They were frequent in the 17th century, and then went out of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n    ┌─────────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────────┐\r\n    │      English.       │     Scotch.      │       French.       │\r\n    │           Thomas    │Thomas            │Thomas               │\r\n    │           Tom       │Tam               │Thumas               │\r\n    │   _Fem._{ Thomassine│Tamlane           │                     │\r\n    │         { Tamzine   │                  │                     │\r\n    ├─────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────────┤\r\n    │      Spanish.       │     Italian.     │      Russian.       │\r\n    │           Tomas     │Tomaso            │         Foma        │\r\n    │           Tome      │Maso              │ _Fem._— Fomaida     │\r\n    │   _Fem._— Tomasa    │Masuccio          │                     │\r\n    │                     │Masaccio          │                     │\r\n    ├─────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────────┤\r\n    │       German.       │     Polish.      │   Lower Lusatian.   │\r\n    │           Thoma     │Tomasz            │Domas                │\r\n    │   _Fem._— Thomasia  │                  │Domask               │\r\n    ├─────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────────┤\r\n    │     Lithuanian.     │    Hungarian.    │      Finland.       │\r\n    │Tamkus               │Tamas             │Tuomas               │\r\n    │Tamoszus             │                  │                     │\r\n    │Dummas               │                  │                     │\r\n    └─────────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThomas is the accepted equivalent for the Irish Tomalhaid, Tomaltach,\r\nand Toirdelvach, tall as a tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VI.—_Joseph._\r\n\r\nWhen, after long waiting and hoping, a son was at length granted to\r\nRachel, she called him Joseph from a word signifying an addition,\r\nbecause she hoped that yet another child would be added to her family.\r\n\r\nJoseph, beloved and honoured as he was for his own beautiful character\r\nand eventful history, has perhaps at the present day the greater number\r\nof direct namesakes among the Arabs, who still are frequently called\r\nYussuf.\r\n\r\nOnly two Josephs occur again in the Scripture before the captivity in\r\nBabylon, but afterwards they were exceedingly numerous, and in the\r\nGospel history two remarkable characters are so named, as well as three\r\nothers whom we know by the Græcized form of the name as Joses, _i. e._ a\r\nfourth brother of the royal family of James, Simon, and Jude; he who was\r\nusually called by his surname of Barnabas, and he who was also called\r\nBarsabas, whose lot was cast with that of Matthias. The Latinized form\r\nwe know as the name of the historian Flavius Josephus. Legend loved to\r\nnarrate that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Gospel to England, and that\r\nhis staff was the Christmas-flowering thorn of Glastonbury; nay, that he\r\ncarried thither the Sanegreal and the holy lance, the mystic objects of\r\nthe adventures of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the reputation of this holy man, and of the universal\r\nreverence for ‘the just man’ of Nazareth, Joseph was scarcely used as a\r\nname in Europe till in 1621 a festival day was fixed by the pope in\r\nhonour of St. Joseph, the husband of the Blessed Virgin.\r\n\r\nTherewith an enthusiasm broke forth in Roman Catholic Europe for the\r\nname. All the world in Italy began to call itself Giuseppe or Gioseffo;\r\nor for short, Peppo and Beppo have swarmed ever since in every village.\r\n\r\nSpain delighted in Josef or Jose, and the more devout in Jose Maria,\r\nwith Pepe or Pepito for the contraction; Pepita for the Josefa, who, of\r\ncourse, arose at the same time, these becoming the most common of all\r\nPeninsular names.\r\n\r\nNot to be behindhand in devotion, the Emperor Leopold christened his son\r\nJoseph, and thus recommended it to all his subjects; and, perhaps, the\r\nTyrol is the greatest of all the strongholds of the Josephs, the name\r\nbeing there called by its last syllable in all endearing varieties,\r\nSepp, Sepperl, &c.; while the Swiss, on the other side, have Sipp and\r\nSippli. Maria Josepha was a daughter of Maria Theresa, and these two are\r\nseldom separated in Germany, Italy, or France; but as Maria forms part\r\nof the name of every Roman Catholic woman, and of most men, the second\r\nname is the one for use. Marie Josephe Rose was the Christian name of\r\nher whom we know and pity as the Empress Josephine, and to whom it is\r\nowing that France was once full of young ladies usually called Fifine or\r\nFinette; while the rougher damsels of Lucerne are content to be Boppi in\r\nfamiliar life.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonians use the varieties Josko and Joska; the Letts turn the\r\nname into Jaschis or Jeps. It is in fact broken into as many odd\r\ncontractions as it can possibly undergo. It is Joseef or Oseep in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nEngland having freed herself from Roman Catholic influence before this\r\nmighty crop of Josephs sprang up, merely regarded the name as one of the\r\nScripture names chiefly used by Puritans, although Joseph Addison has\r\ngiven it distinction in literature; and there Joe is of uncertain\r\norigin, as it is as often the contraction of Josiah or Joshua as of\r\nJoseph. In some parts of England, Joseph and Mary are considered\r\nappropriate to twins. Josephine is with us a mere introduction from the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nJoseph, or Joses, as he was called since, coming from Cyprus—he was one\r\nof the Hellenistic Jews—is best known to us under his surname of\r\nBarnabas, which St. Luke explains from the Aramaic as υἱος παρακλησέος\r\n(uios parakleseos), the son of comfort, a word which bears different\r\ninterpretations, since comfort may be either exhortation or consolation;\r\nand it is in the latter sense that St. Chrysostom and our translators\r\nhave understood the word, though there are many who prefer the other\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nBarnabas has not been a very common name, though, with an apostle for\r\nits origin, it could not fail to be everywhere known; but it was never\r\nroyal; and the only historical character so called, Bernabo Visconti,\r\nwas enough to give any name an evil odour. We make it Barnaby when we do\r\nuse it, the Irish call it Barney and confuse it with Brian, and the\r\nRussians call it Varnava. One Barnabas Hutchinson, proctor of the\r\nchapter of Durham, who died in 1633, is thus commemorated in his\r\nepitaph:—\r\n\r\n                       “Under this thorne tree\r\n                       Lies honest Barnabee.”[9]\r\n\r\nJoseph had named his two sons Manasseh (forgetting), because he said,\r\n“God hath made me _forget_ all my toil,” and Ephraim (twofold increase).\r\nThe first was early adopted by the Israelites; we find it belonging to\r\nthe son of Hezekiah, and to the father of Judith, and, to our amazement,\r\nto a mediæval knight, whose friends may perhaps have brought it from the\r\nCrusades. Two early bishops of Cambrai bore the name of Manassès, and\r\nthere is one among the under-tenants in Domesday Book. In Ireland, the\r\nname of Manus, a corruption of Magnus, derived from the Northmen who\r\ninvented it, is turned into Manasses.\r\n\r\nEphraim, like other patriarchal names, lived on in Mesopotamia; and St.\r\nEphrem of Edessa, who lived in the beginning of the fourth century, is\r\nesteemed as a doctor of the Church, and is the name-saint of numerous\r\nRussians, who keep his day on the 28th of January, though the Roman\r\nChurch marks it in July.[10]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Kitto’s _Biblical Cyclopædia_; Trollope’s _Greek Testament_;\r\n  Michaelis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Michaelis; O'Donovan’s _Irish Names_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VII.—_Benjamin._\r\n\r\nWhen the long-desired ‘addition,’ the second son, was given to Rachel,\r\nand in the words of Jacob she “died by him when there was but a little\r\nway to come to Ephrath,” she called the infant who had cost her life\r\nBen-oni (son of my sorrow); but this was changed by his father into\r\nBen-Yamin (son of my right hand, _i. e._ prosperous).\r\n\r\nIn spite of Rare Ben Jonson, Benjamin is an essentially Puritan and\r\nJewish name; such a feminine as Benjamina has even been perpetrated.\r\nOddly enough the Bretons call Benjamin Benoni.\r\n\r\nBenoni, “the child of sorrow,” and Ichabod, “the glory is departed,”\r\nwere so frequent among the Puritans of the time of James I. that Mr.\r\nBardsley thinks that they could not have been so much allusions to\r\nfamily distress as to the afflictions of the Puritan sect. Benoni occurs\r\nin the rate of six to one compared with Benjamin in the registers of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the place of Ben was taken by the Syriac Bar, the earliest\r\ninstance being that of old Barzillai, the Gileadite, whose name\r\nsignified the son of iron. It seems as though under the Herodean kingdom\r\nthe custom was coming in that forms the first surnames, that of calling\r\nthe son by his patronymic almost in preference to his own individual\r\nappellation, and thus arose some of the double titles that confuse us as\r\nto the identity of the earlier saints. Thus, the “Israelite without\r\nguile,” is first introduced as Nathanael, the same as the ancient\r\nNethaneel, captain of the tribe of Issachar, and meaning the gift of\r\nGod, being compounded of the Divine Word and nathan (a gift). Nathan was\r\nthe name of the prophet who rebuked David, and of the son whose\r\ndescendants seem to have taken the place of the royal line. Elnathan\r\noccurs as father to the wife of one of the kings, and Jonathan has\r\nexactly the same meaning, the gift of God. In the list of apostles,\r\nNathanael is called by his patronymic Bartholomaios, as it stands in the\r\nGreek, and Tholomaios is referred to Talmai (furrows), which occurs in\r\nthe list of the sons of Anak, and also as belonging to the King of\r\nGeshur, Absalom’s grandfather.\r\n\r\nIn the uncertainty whether it was really the apostle, Nathanael was left\r\nunused until those English took it up, by whom it was made into Nat.\r\n\r\nThe other form, though not popular, is of all nations, and from its\r\nunwieldy length has endless contractions, perhaps the larger number\r\nbeing German, since it is most common in that central Teutonic land.\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐\r\n │    English.    │    German.     │     Dutch.     │     Swiss.     │\r\n │Bartholomew     │Bartholomaus    │Bartelmês       │Bartleme        │\r\n │Bart            │Bertel          │                │Bartli          │\r\n │Bartley         │Barthol         │                │                │\r\n │Bat             │Mewes           │                │                │\r\n │                │Bartold         │                │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │   Bavarian.    │    French.     │    Danish.     │    Spanish.    │\r\n │Bartlmê         │Bartholomieu    │Bartholomeuis   │Bartolome       │\r\n │Bartl           │Bartolomée      │Bartel          │Bartolo         │\r\n │Wawel           │Tolomieu        │Bardo           │                │\r\n │Wabel           │                │                │                │\r\n │Wabm            │                │                │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │  Portuguese.   │    Italian.    │    Russian.    │    Polish.     │\r\n │Bartolomeu      │Bartolomeo      │Varfolomei      │Bartlomiej      │\r\n │Bartolomeo      │Bortolo         │                │Bartek          │\r\n │Bortolo         │                │                │                │\r\n │Meo             │                │                │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │   Illyrian.    │    Lusatian    │   Esthonian    │   Lithuanian   │\r\n │Bartuo          │Bartolik        │Partel          │Baltras         │\r\n │Barteo          │Barto           │Pert            │Baltramejus     │\r\n │Jernij          │Batram          │                │                │\r\n │Vratolomije     │                │                │                │\r\n └────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION VIII.—_Job._\r\n\r\nWe must not quit the patriarchal names without mentioning that of Job.\r\nThis mysterious person is stated in the margin of the Alexandrian\r\nversion to have originally borne the name of Jobab, which means\r\nshouting; and a tradition of the Jews, adopted by some of the Christian\r\nfathers, makes him the same as the Jobab, prince of Edom, mentioned in\r\nthe genealogy in the 33rd chapter of Genesis, a supposition according\r\nwith his evident position as a great desert sheik, as well as with the\r\nearly date of his history.\r\n\r\nJob, however, as he is called throughout his book, is explained by some\r\nto mean persecuted; by others a penitent; and it is evident from a\r\npassage in the Koran that this was the way that Mahommed understood it.\r\nThe tradition of his sufferings lived on among the Arabs, who have many\r\nstories about Eyub, or Ayoub, as they pronounce the name still common\r\namong them, and their nickname for the patient camel is Abi Ayub, father\r\nof Job.\r\n\r\nJöv, probably from their eastern connections, is a name used by the\r\nRussians, and has belonged to one of their patriarchs. Otherwise it is a\r\nvery infrequent name even in England.\r\n\r\nJob’s three daughters, Jemima, Kezia, and Kerenhappuch, are explained to\r\nmean a dove, cassia, and a horn of stibium. This latter is the paint\r\nwith which eastern ladies were wont to enhance the beauty of their\r\neyelashes, and it is curious to find this little artifice so ancient and\r\nso highly esteemed as to give the very name to the fair daughter of the\r\nrestored patriarch, perhaps because her eyes were too lovely to need any\r\nsuch adornment. Hers has never been a popular name, only being given\r\nsometimes to follow up those of her sisters; Kezia is a good deal used\r\nin England, and belonged to a sister of Wesley, who was called Kissy;\r\nbut Jemima is by far the most general of the three.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew interpretation of Jemima makes it a day, but the Arabic word\r\nfor a dove resembles it more closely, and critics, therefore, prefer to\r\nconsider it as the Arab feminine version of that which the Israelites\r\nhad among them as Jonah (a dove). This belonged to the prophet of\r\nNineveh. It is not usual in Europe, but strangely enough the Lithuanians\r\nuse it as Jonsazus, and the Lapps as Jonka.\r\n\r\nWhat strange fancy can have made Mehetabel, the wife of one of the\r\nprinces of Edom, leave her four syllables to be popular in England? Many\r\nvillage registers all over the country show it. Was it a remnant of the\r\nEast in Cornwall, or did Puritans choose it for its meaning, God is\r\nbeneficent? It was at Jarrow as early as 1578.\r\n\r\nTamar, a palm tree, it may here be mentioned, has continued common among\r\neastern Christians, especially since a distinguished Armenian queen was\r\nso called. Now and then very great lovers of biblical names in England\r\ngive it, and likewise Dinah (judgment).[11]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Smith’s _Dictionary of the Bible_; Kitto’s _Biblical Cycloædia_;\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                            ISRAELITE NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION I.—_Moses and Aaron._\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Exodus, the Israelites had become a nation, and their\r\nnames, though still formed from a living language, were becoming more\r\nhereditary and conventional than those of the patriarchal times.\r\n\r\nThat of Moses himself, interpreted by the Scripture as meaning drawn out\r\nof the water, belongs rather to the Egyptian than to the Hebrew\r\nlanguage. It probably came from the Coptic _mo_, water, and _usha_,\r\nsaved; though the Hebrew, _mâshâh_, also presents a ready derivation:\r\nthe great Law-giver. It has never been forgotten in the East, where the\r\nArabs in the desert point out Gebel Mousa, the rock of Moses, whence\r\nthey say the water flowed, and Wady Mousa, the vale of Moses. Mousa is a\r\nfrequent name among the Arabs to this day, and among the gallant Moors\r\nof Granada, none stands so prominently forward in the noble rivalry of\r\nAbencerrages and Zegris as does the champion Muza.\r\n\r\nMoses was unused by the Jews while they continued a nation, but has been\r\nvery common in their dispersion, and in Poland has come to be pronounced\r\nMojzesz. The frequent Jewish surname Moss is taken from one of these\r\ncontinental corruptions of the name of the great Law-giver. In Ireland\r\nthe name Magsheesh has been adopted by the inhabitants as an imitation\r\nof Moses; but no form of Moses is used elsewhere, except as a direct\r\nScripture name.\r\n\r\nThe name of Thermuthis has been found on a tombstone, given apparently\r\nin honour of Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Josephus thus denominates.\r\n\r\nAaron’s name is in like manner considered to be Egyptian, and the\r\nmeaning is very doubtful, though it is commonly explained as a high\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nAaron seems to have been assumed as a name by some of our old British\r\nChristians, or else it was accepted as an equivalent for something\r\nKeltic, for Aaron and Julius were among our very few British martyrs\r\nunder Diocletian’s persecution, and a later Aaron was an abbot in\r\nBrittany; but it has never been a name in use.[12]\r\n\r\nThe sister of Moses and Aaron, who led the songs of the Israelites when\r\nthey saw their enemies dead upon the sea-shore, was the first owner of\r\nthat name which was to be the most highly honoured among those of women.\r\n\r\nYet it is a name respecting which there is great contention. Gesenius\r\nderives it from _Merî_ (stubbornness), with the addition of the third\r\nperson plural, so as to make it mean their rebellion. Other commentators\r\nrefer it to the word _Marah_ (bitterness), and thence the bitter gum,\r\nmyrrh, the same term that was applied to the brackish springs in the\r\ndesert, and to which the desolate widow of Bethlehem declared her right,\r\nwhen she cried, “Call me not Naomi (pleasant), call me Marah (bitter).”\r\nThis is on the whole the most satisfactory derivation, but in the middle\r\nages it was explained as Myrrh of the Sea, Lady of the Sea, or Star of\r\nthe Sea, the likeness to the Latin, Keltic, and Teutonic _mar_ being\r\nprobably the guide. Star of the Sea is the favourite explanation among\r\nRoman Catholics, as the loftiest and most poetical, and it is referred\r\nto in many of their hymns and other devotional compositions.\r\n\r\nMiriam does not seem to have been repeated until after the captivity,\r\nwhen it took the Greek forms of Mariam and Mariamne, and became very\r\nfrequent among Jewish women, probably in the expectation of the new\r\ndeliverance from the bondage that galled them like that of Egypt of old.\r\nIt was the name of the Asmonean princess in whom the brave Maccabean\r\nline was extinguished by Herod the Great; it belonged to three if not to\r\nfour of the women of the Gospel; and we find it again marking the\r\nmiserable being who is cited as having fulfilled the most terrible of\r\nall the woes denounced by Moses upon the daughters of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe name of Mariam continued in the East, but was very slow in creeping\r\ninto the Western Church, though not only the Blessed Virgin herself had\r\nborne it, but two very popular saints, namely, the Magdalen, and the\r\nPenitent of Egypt, whose legends were both current at a very early\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe first Maria whom I can find of undoubted western birth was a Spanish\r\nmaiden, who was martyred by the Moors at Cordova in 851. Michaelis tells\r\nus that the old Spanish name of Urraca is the same as Maria, but this\r\ncan hardly be true.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the devotion of the Crusaders that first brought\r\nMaria into Europe, for we find the first instances about the middle of\r\nthe twelfth century all at once; Maria of Antioch, a Crusader’s\r\ndaughter, who married the Emperor Manuel Comnenus; her daughter, Maria\r\nComnena, married to the Marquis of Montferrat; Marie, the daughter of\r\nLouis VII. of France, and our Eleanor of Guienne, named probably during\r\ntheir Crusader’s fervour; then Marie, the translator of the Breton\r\nlegends for Henry III.; Marie, the nun daughter of Edward I., and at the\r\nsame time Marie all over the western world.\r\n\r\nProbably the addition of the German diminutive _chen_, in French _on_,\r\nformed the name of\r\n\r\n                  “A bonny fine maid of noble degree,\r\n                    Maid Marion called by name.”\r\n\r\nVery soon had her fame travelled abroad, for in 1332 the play of _Robin\r\net Marion_ was performed by the students of Angers, one of them\r\nappearing as a _fillette déguisée_. The origin of _Marionettes_, puppets\r\ndisguised to play the part of Maid Marion, is thus explained. They may,\r\nhowever, have received their name from the habit of calling small images\r\nof the Blessed Virgin Mariettes, or Marionettes. Several streets of old\r\nParis, in which were such images, were called Rue des Mariettes, or\r\nlater, Rue des Marionettes. All puppets there came to be called\r\nMariettes and Marmousets; and two streets of Paris were down to the last\r\ncentury called Rue des Marmousets. Henri Etienne says: “Never did the\r\nEgyptians take such cruel vengeance for the murder of their cats, as has\r\nbeen wreaked in our days on those who had mutilated some Marmouset or\r\nMarionette.” Even the bauble of a licensed fool was a Marotte, from the\r\nlittle head at its point, and the supernatural dolls of sorcerers, in\r\nthe form of toads or apes, were described as Marionettes in an account\r\nof a trial for witchcraft in 1600. The term Marmoset passed to the\r\ndaintiest and most elegant of the monkey tribe, by which it is now\r\nmonopolized. Marion became a common name in France, and contracted into\r\nManon, and expanded into Marionette, as in a poem of the 13th century\r\nwhere Marion is thus addressed; and in Scotland, where “Maid Marion,\r\nfair as ivory bone,” likewise figured in rustic pageantry, she took a\r\nstronger hold than anywhere else, is in common life yclept Menie, and\r\nhas escaped her usual fate of confusion with Marianne. With us, the\r\nBlessed Virgin’s name, having come through the French, was spelt in\r\ntheir fashion till the translation of the Bible made our national Mary\r\nfamiliar. Mary II. was the first of our queens who dropped the _ie_.

Indeed, the Italian proverb, answering to the\r\nneedle in a bottle of hay, is “_Cercar Maria in Ravenna_,” so numerous\r\nare the Marias there. Even in Ireland there were few Marys till\r\ncomparatively recent times; but now the Môr that in some parts of the\r\nisland was translated by Sarah, is changed into Mary.\r\n\r\nSince Marys have been thus multiplied, the attributes of the first Mary\r\nhave been adopted into the Christian name, and used to distinguish their\r\nbearer. The earliest and best of these was the Italian Maria Annunciata,\r\nor Annunziata, contracted into Nunziata; and followed up in Spain by\r\nMaria Anonciada; and in France, by Marie Annonciade. Soon there followed\r\nMaria Assunta, in honour of her supposed assumption bodily into glory,\r\nbut this never flourished beyond Italy, Spain, and her colonies.\r\n\r\nFrance has Marie des Anges, at least as a conventual appellation; as in\r\nSpain the votaress of the merciful interceding patroness is called Maria\r\nde Mercedes; and she whose parents were mindful of the Seven Sorrows\r\nsupposed to have pierced the heart of the Holy Mother, would choose for\r\ntheir child Maria de Dolores. There was a legend that Santiago had seen\r\na vision of the Blessed Virgin standing on a pillar of jasper and\r\nbidding him found at Zaragoza the church thence called Nuestra Señora\r\ndel Pilar, whence, in Spain at least, Pilar has become a female name, as\r\nGuadalupe has likewise in honour of a miraculous image of St. Mary,\r\npreserved in the church of the mountain once covered with hermitages.\r\nMoreover, a district in Mexico, formerly called Tlaltelolco, contained a\r\ntemple to a favourite goddess of the Aztec race. After the Spanish\r\nconquest, the same site became the scene of a vision of Nuestra Señora,\r\nwho appeared to a Christian Indian, and intimated that a church was\r\nthere to be built in her honour. As a token of the reality of the\r\nvision, roses burst forth on the bare rock of the Tepeyac, and it\r\nfurther appeared impressed with a miraculous painting, which has been\r\nthe great subject of adoration from the Mexicans ever since. Guadalupe,\r\na free translation into Spanish of the native name of Tlaltelolco, has\r\nbeen ever since a favourite name with the damsels of Mexico, and is even\r\nadopted by such of the other sex as regard the shrine with special\r\nveneration. Maria del Incarnaçion is also Spanish. An English gipsy\r\nwoman lately said ‘Carnation’ was her daughter’s name, and had been her\r\ngrandmother’s. Was it from this source?\r\n\r\nAs queen of heaven, Maria has votaries, called in Italy Regina or Reina.\r\nThe latter was frequent in early times at Florence. In France we find\r\nReine and Reinette, and Regina is a favourite in some parts of Germany,\r\nwhere it has been confused with the derivatives of the old Teutonic\r\nRagin, Council.\r\n\r\nSince the promulgation of the new dogma, young ladies in Spain have been\r\ncalled Maria de la Concepcion; in Italy, Concetta. Surely the\r\nsuperstition of these races is recorded in their names. The custom of\r\nadding Maria to a man’s name seems to have begun in Italy about 1360,\r\nand now most individuals in Italy, and probably likewise in Spain, as\r\nwell as in the more devout French families, bear the name of Maria; and\r\nthe old Latin Marius and Virginius, though entirely unconnected except\r\nby the sound, have been pressed into the service, and made to do duty as\r\nMario and Virginio in her honour.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Jews had in some degree adopted the Roman fashion of similar\r\nnames in a family, since the sister of the Blessed Virgin bears the same\r\nas her own, and there is a great similarity between those of the sisters\r\nof Bethany, which both probably come from _mara_ (bitter), although some\r\ndeduce Martha from the Aramean _mar_ (a lord), which we often hear as\r\nthe title of Syrian bishops, as Mar Elias, &c.\r\n\r\nEven the earliest writers on the Gospels were at a loss whether to\r\nidentify the meek contemplative Mary of Bethany, by the woman that was a\r\nsinner, who is recorded as performing the same act of devotion, and with\r\nMary Magdalen, once possessed by seven devils and afterwards first\r\nwitness of the Resurrection. While inquiry was cautious, legend was\r\nbold, and threw the three into one without the slightest doubt, going on\r\nundoubtingly to narrate the vain and sinful career of Mary Magdalen,\r\ndescribing her luxury, her robes, and in especial her embroidered gloves\r\nand flowing hair, and all the efforts of Martha to convert her, until\r\nher final repentance. The story proceeded to relate how the whole family\r\nset out on a mission to Provence, where Martha, by holding up the cross,\r\ndemolished a terrific dragon; and Mary, after having aided in converting\r\nthe country, retired to a frightful desert with a skull for her only\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nIt is this legendary Magdalen, whom painters loved to portray in all her\r\ndishevelled grief.\r\n\r\nThe word itself is believed to be a mere adjective of place, meaning\r\nthat she came from Magdala, which, in its turn, means a tower or castle,\r\nand is represented by the little village of Mejdel, on the lake of\r\nTiberias, so that her proper designation would be Mary of Magdala, _i.\r\ne._ of the tower, probably to distinguish her from Mary of Bethany with\r\nwhom she is confounded.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how infinitely more popular her name has been\r\nthan her sister’s, _i. e._ accepting the mediæval belief that they\r\n_were_ sisters. The Marfa of Russia is of course like the English\r\nMartha, Matty, Patty, the true housewifely Martha, independent of the\r\nlegend of the dragon, and has there been a royal name occurring\r\nfrequently among the daughters of the earlier Tzars; and the Martha used\r\nin Ireland is only as an equivalent for the native Erse Meabhdh, Meave,\r\nor Mab, once a great Irish princess, who has since become the queen of\r\nthe fairies. Martha used also to be used for Mor. But the Marthe and\r\nMarthon of the south of France, and the rarer Marta of Italy and Spain,\r\nwere all from the Provençal dragon-slayer, and as to the popularity of\r\nMagdalen, the contractions in the following table will best prove it:\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐\r\n │    English.    │    German.     │     Swiss.     │    Danish.     │\r\n │Magdalene       │Magdalene       │Magdalene       │Magdelene       │\r\n │Maudlin         │Madlen          │                │Malin           │\r\n │Maun            │Lene            │Leli            │Magli           │\r\n │Madeline        │Lenchen         │                │Mali            │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │    Italian.    │    French.     │    Polish.     │    Servian.    │\r\n │Maddalena       │Magdelaine      │Magdelina       │Mandelina       │\r\n │   ——————————   │Mazaline—_old_  │Magdusia        │Manda           │\r\n │    Spanish.    │Madeleine       │Magdosia        │                │\r\n │Magdalena       │Madelon         │Madde           │                │\r\n │Madelena        │                │                │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │   Lusatian.    │   Esthonian.   │      Ung.      │    Lettish.    │\r\n │Madlena         │Madli           │Magdalena       │Madlene         │\r\n │Marlena         │Mai             │Magdolna        │Maddalene       │\r\n │Marlenka        │Male            │                │Madde           │\r\n │Madlenka        │                │                │                │\r\n └────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe penitent Mary of Egypt has had her special votaresses.

This was the habit of making\r\nthe name contain a dedication to the Deity, by beginning or ending it\r\nwith a word of Divine signification.\r\n\r\nThe Divine title known to man before the special revelation to Moses in\r\nthe burning bush, was the Hebrew word El, in the plural Elohim, which\r\ncorresponds to our term Deity or God-head. It was by a derivative from\r\nthis word that Jacob called the spot where he beheld the angels, Beth El\r\n(the House of God), and again the place where he built an altar, El\r\nElohe Israel (the God of Israel), as indeed his own name of Israel meant\r\nprevailing with God.\r\n\r\nThis termination is to be found in the names of several of his\r\ngrandsons; but we will only in the present section review the class of\r\nnames where it serves as a prefix.\r\n\r\nThe first of all of these is Eliezer (God of help), the name of\r\nAbraham’s steward who went to bring home Rebecca, and again of the\r\nsecond son of Moses. A very slight change, indicated in our version by\r\nthe change of the vowels, made it Eleazar, or God will help, the name of\r\nAaron’s eldest surviving son, the second high priest. Both continued\r\nfrequent among the Jews before the captivity, and after it the\r\ndistinction between them was not observed, though Eleazar was in high\r\nrepute as having belonged to the venerable martyr in the Antiochian\r\npersecution, as well as to the brave Maccabee, who perished under the\r\nweight of the elephant he had stabbed.\r\n\r\nIn the Gospels, Eleazar has become Lazarus, and in this form is bestowed\r\nupon the beggar of the parable, as well as on him who was raised from\r\nthe dead. It is curious to observe the countries where it has been in\r\nuse. The true old form once comes to light in the earlier middle age as\r\nSt. Elzéar, the Comte de St. Sabran, who became a devotee of St.\r\nFrancis, and has had a scanty supply of local namesakes. The beggar’s\r\nname has been frequently adopted in Spain as Lazaro or Lazarillo; Italy\r\nhas many a Lazzaro; Poland, shows Lazarz; Russia, Lasar; Illyria, Lazo\r\nand Laze.\r\n\r\nAaron’s wife was Elischeba, meaning God hath sworn, _i. e._ an appeal to\r\nhis covenant. It recurred again in the priestly family in the Gospel\r\nperiod, and had become, in its Greek form, Ελισαβετ; in Latin,\r\nElisabeth.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the Baptist was not canonized in the West, though, I\r\nbelieve, she was so in the East, for there arose her first historical\r\nnamesake, the Muscovite princess Elisavetta, the daughter of Jaroslav,\r\nand the object of the romantic love of that splendid poet and sea-king,\r\nHarald Hardràda, of Norway, who sung nineteen songs of his own\r\ncomposition in her praise on his way to her from Constantinople, and won\r\nher hand by feats of prowess. Although she soon died, her name remained\r\nin the northern peninsula, and figures in many a popular tale and Danish\r\nballad, as Elsebin, Lisbet, or Helsa. It was the Slavonic nations,\r\nhowever, who first brought it into use, and from them it crept into\r\nGermany, and thence to the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nElisabeth of Hainault, on her marriage with Philippe Auguste, seems to\r\nhave been the first to suffer the transmutation into Isabelle, the\r\nFrench being the nation of all others who delighted to bring everything\r\ninto conformity with their own pronunciation. The royal name thus\r\nintroduced became popular among the crown vassals, and Isabelle of\r\nAngoulême, betrothed to Hugues de Lusignan, but married to King John,\r\nbrought Isabel to England, whence her daughter, the wife of Friedrich\r\nII., conveyed Isabella to Germany and Sicily. Meantime the lovely\r\ncharacter of Elisabeth of Hungary—or Erzsebet as she is called in her\r\nnative country—earned saintly honours, and caused the genuine form to be\r\nextremely popular in all parts of Germany. Her namesake great-niece was,\r\nhowever, in Aragon turned into Isabel, and when married into Portugal,\r\nreceived the surname of De la Paz, because of her gentle, peace-making\r\nnature. She was canonized; and Isabel, or Ysabel, as it is now the\r\nfashion to spell it in Spain, has ever since been the chief feminine\r\nroyal name in the Peninsula, and was rendered especially glorious and\r\nbeloved by Isabel the Catholic.\r\n\r\nIn the French royal family it was much used during the middle ages, and\r\nsent us no fewer than two specimens, namely, the ‘She-Wolf of France,’\r\nand the child-queen of Richard II.; but though used by the Plantagenets\r\nand their nobility, it took no hold of the English taste; and it was\r\nonly across the Scottish border that Isobel or Isbel, probably learned\r\nfrom French allies, became popular, insomuch that its contraction,\r\nTibbie, has been from time immemorial one of the commonest of all\r\npeasant names in the Lowlands. The wicked and selfish wife of Charles\r\nVI. of France was always called Isabeau, probably from some forgotten\r\nBavarian contraction; but she brought her appellation into disrepute,\r\nand it has since her time become much more infrequent in France.\r\n\r\nThe fine old English ballad that makes ‘pretty Bessee’ the granddaughter\r\nof Simon de Montfort is premature in its nomenclature; for the first\r\nBess on record is Elizabeth Woodville, whose mother, Jacquetta of\r\nLuxemburg, no doubt imported it from Flanders. Shakespeare always makes\r\nEdward IV. call her Bess; and her daughter Elizabeth of York is the lady\r\nBessee of the curious verses recording the political courtship of Henry\r\nof Richmond. Thence came the name of Good Queen Bess, the most popular\r\nand homely of all borne by English women, so that, while in the last\r\ncentury a third at least of the court damsels were addressed as ‘Lady\r\nBetty,’ it so abounded in villages that the old riddle arose out of the\r\ncontractions.\r\n\r\nDuring the anti-Spanish alliance between England and France, Edward VI.\r\nwas sponsor to a child of Henri II., who received the Tudor name of\r\nElisabeth, but could not become the wife of Philip II., without turning\r\ninto Isabel; indeed, the Italian Elisabetta Farnese—a determined\r\npersonage—was the only lady who seems to have avoided this\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nPoetry did not improve our Queen Elizabeth by making her into Eliza, a\r\nform which, however, became so prevalent in England during the early\r\npart of the present century, that Eliza and Elizabeth are sometimes to\r\nbe found in the same family. No name has so many varieties of\r\ncontraction, as will be seen by the ensuing list, where, in deference to\r\nmodern usage, Elizabeth is placed separately from Isabella.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │  German.   │ Bavarian.  │   Swiss.   │\r\n   │Elizabeth   │Elizabeth   │Elisabeth   │Lisi        │Elsbeth     │\r\n   │Eliza       │Elspeth     │Elise       │Liserl      │Betha       │\r\n   │Bessy       │Elspie      │Lise        │            │Bebba       │\r\n   │Betsey      │Bessie      │Lischen     │            │Bebbeli     │\r\n   │Betty       │Lizzie      │Elsabet     │            │            │\r\n   │Lizzy       │            │Elsbet      │            │            │\r\n   │Libby       │            │Bettine     │            │            │\r\n   │Lisa        │            │Bette       │            │            │\r\n   │            │            │Ilse        │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Danish.   │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Russian.  │  Polish.   │\r\n   │Elisabeth   │Elisabeth   │Elisabetta  │Jelissaveta │Elzbieta    │\r\n   │Elsebin     │Elise       │Elisa       │Lisa        │Elzbietka   │\r\n   │Helsa       │Babet       │Betta       │Lisenka     │            │\r\n   │            │Babette     │Bettina     │            │            │\r\n   │            │Babichon    │Lisettina   │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Servian.  │  Slovak.   │ Esthonian. │ Hungarian. │ Lusatian.  │\r\n   │Jelisavcta  │Lizbeta     │Ello        │Erzebet     │Hilzbeta    │\r\n   │Jelisavka   │Liza        │Elts        │Erzsi       │Hilza       │\r\n   │Liza        │Lizika      │Liso        │Erszok      │Hilzizka    │\r\n   │            │            │            │Orse        │Lisa        │\r\n   │            │            │            │Orsike      │Liska       │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │Beta        │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nLise and Lisette are sometimes taken as contractions of Elisabeth, but\r\nthey properly belong to Louise.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │  French.   │  Spanish.  │Portuguese. │\r\n   │Isabella    │Isabel      │Isabeau     │Ysabel      │Isabel      │\r\n   │Isabel      │Isbel       │Isabelle    │Bela        │Isabelhina  │\r\n   │Belle       │Tibbie      │            │            │            │\r\n   │Nib         │            │            │            │            │\r\n   │Ibbot       │            │            │            │            │\r\n   │Ib          │            │            │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nScotland and Spain are the countries of Isabel; England and Germany of\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe noblest prophet of the kingdom of Israel was called by two Hebrew\r\nwords, meaning God the Lord, a sound most like what is represented by\r\nthe letters Eliyahu, the same in effect as that of the young man who\r\nreproved Job and his friends, though, in his case, the Hebrew points\r\nhave led to his being called in our Bible Elihu, while we know the\r\nprophet as Elijah, the translators probably intending us to pronounce\r\nthe _j_ like an _i_. The Greek translators had long before formed Ἠλιας,\r\nthe Elias of the New Testament.\r\n\r\nWhen the Empress Helena visited Palestine, she built a church on Mount\r\nCarmel, around which arose a cluster of hermitages, and thus the great\r\nprophet and his miracles became known both to East and West.\r\n\r\nWhen the Crusaders visited the Mount of Carmel frowning above Acre, and\r\nbeheld the church and the hermits around it, marked the spot where the\r\ngreat prophet had prayed, and the brook where he slew the idolaters, no\r\nwonder they became devoted to his name, and Helie became very frequent,\r\nespecially among the Normans. Helie de la Flèche was the protector of\r\nDuke Robert’s young son, William Clito; and Helie and Elie were long in\r\nuse in France, as Ellis must once have been in England, to judge by the\r\nsurnames it has left. Elias is still very common in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe order of Carmelites claimed to have been founded by the prophet\r\nhimself; but when the Latins inundated Palestine, it first came into\r\nnotice, and became known all over the West. It was placed under the\r\ninvocation of St. Mary, who was thus called in Italy the Madonna di\r\nCarmela or di Carmine, and, in consequence, the two names of Carmela and\r\nCarmine took root among the Italian ladies, by whom they are still used.\r\nThe meaning of Carmel, as applied to the mountain, is vineyard or\r\nfruitful field.\r\n\r\nElisha’s name meant God of Salvation. It becomes Eliseus in the New\r\nTestament, but has been very seldom repeated; though it is possible that\r\nthe frequent Ellis of the middle ages may spring from it.\r\n\r\nHere, too, it may be best to mention the prophetic name by which the\r\nHumanity of the Messiah was revealed to Isaiah—Immanuel (God with us),\r\n_Imm_ meaning with; _an_ being the pronoun.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks appear to have been the first to take up this as a Christian\r\nname, and Manuel Komnenos made it known in Europe. The Italians probably\r\ncaught it from them as Manovello; and the Spaniards and Portuguese were\r\nmuch addicted to giving it, especially after the reign of Dom Manoel,\r\none of the best kings of the noble house of Avis. Manuelita is a\r\nfeminine in use in the Peninsula. When used as a masculine, as it is\r\noccasionally in England and France, the first letter is generally\r\nchanged to _E_.[15]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Michaelis; Grimm, _Deutsche Mythologie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION IV.—_Joshua, &c._\r\n\r\nA still more sacred personal Divine Name was revealed to Moses upon\r\nMount Horeb—the name that proclaimed the eternal self-existence of Him\r\nwho gave the mission to the oppressed Israelites.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of that Name we know, in its simple and ineffable majesty;\r\nthe pronunciation we do not know, for the most learned doubt whether\r\nthat the usual substitute for it may not be a mistake. The Jews\r\nthemselves feared to pronounce it commonly in reading their scriptures,\r\nand substituted for it Adonai, that which is indicated by the ‘LORD,’ in\r\ncapital letters in our Bibles, while the French try to give something of\r\nthe original import by using the word _l'Éternel_, and thus the\r\ntradition of the true sound has been hidden from man, and all that is\r\nknown is that the three consonants employed in it were J, or rather Y V\r\nH.\r\n\r\nYet, though this holy name was only indicated in reading, it was very\r\nfrequent in combination in the names of the Israelites, being the\r\ncommencement of almost all those that with us begin with _je_ or _jo_,\r\nthe termination of all those with _iah_. Nay, the use of the name in\r\nthis manner has received the highest sanction, since it was by\r\ninspiration that Moses added to Hoshea, salvation—the syllable that made\r\nit Jehoshea or Joshua, “the Lord my salvation,” fitly marking out the\r\nwarrior, who, by Divine assistance, should save Israel, and place them\r\nsafely in the promised land.\r\n\r\nThat name of the captain of the salvation of Israel seems to have been\r\nuntouched again till the return from the captivity, when probably some\r\nunconscious inspiration directed it to be given to the restorer of the\r\nJews, that typical personage, the high priest, in whom we find it\r\naltered into Jeshua; and the Greek soon made it into the form in which\r\nit appears as belonging to the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus, and\r\nwhich, when owned by the apostate high priest, under Antiochus\r\nEpiphanes, was made by him from Jesus into Jason, to suit the taste of\r\nthe Greek rulers. It had become common among the Jews; it was the\r\ncurrent name for the ancient Joshua, when it was assumed by Him Who\r\nalone had a right to it.\r\n\r\nA feast in honour of that Name “to which every knee shall bow,” has been\r\nmarked by the Western Church, and it is probably in consequence of this\r\nthat the Spanish Americans actually have adopted this as one of their\r\nChristian names—a profanation whence all the rest of Christendom has\r\nshrunk. There too _a_ and _ita_ are added to it to make it feminine.\r\n\r\nIn the unfortunate son and grandson of the good Josiah (yielded to the\r\nLord), we see some curious changes of name. The son was called both\r\nEliakim and Jehoiakim, in which the verb meant “will establish or\r\njudge;” the only difference was in the Divine Name that preceded it.\r\nThis miserable prince died during the first siege of Jerusalem, and his\r\nson Jehoiachin (appointed of the Lord), reigned for three months till\r\nthe city was taken, and he was carried away to Babylon. The\r\nabove-mentioned seems to have been his proper name, but he was commonly\r\ncalled Jeconiah, and Jeremiah denounces his punishment without the\r\nprefix, as “this man Coniah.”\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Nebuchadnezzar, Jehoiachin was brought out of prison,\r\nand lived in some degree of ease and favour at Babylon; and by Greek\r\nauthors a sort of compromise was made between his name and his father’s,\r\nand he becomes sometimes Jeconias, and sometimes Joacim.\r\n\r\nThere was an early tradition that Joachim had been the name of the\r\nfather of the Blessed Virgin, but her private history did not assume any\r\ngreat prominence till about 1500, and in consequence the names of her\r\nparents are far less often used before than after that era. Her mother’s\r\nname, as we shall see, had a history of its own; and was earlier in\r\ngeneral use than that of her father, which scarcely came into England at\r\nall, and was better known to us when Murat ascended the throne of Naples\r\nthan at any other time. Being however found in the apocryphal Gospels,\r\nit was in use in the Greek Church, and is therefore to be found in\r\nRussia. Its forms are,\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐\r\n │    German.     │   Bavarian.    │    Frisjan.    │     Swiss.     │\r\n │Joachim         │Jochum          │Hime            │Jocheli         │\r\n │Jochim          │Jochem          │                │                │\r\n │Achim           │                │                │                │\r\n │Chim            │                │                │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │    Spanish.    │    French.     │    Italian.    │    Danish.     │\r\n │Joaquim         │Joachim         │Gioachimo       │Joachim         │\r\n │Joquim          │                │Gioachino       │Johum           │\r\n │Joa             │                │Giovachino      │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │    Russian.    │    Polish.     │     Lett.      │   Illyrian.    │\r\n │Joachim         │Jachym          │Juzziz          │Accim           │\r\n │Akim            │                │Jukkums         │Jacim           │\r\n └────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Germans, French, and Portuguese have the feminine Joachime,\r\nJoaquima; or, in Illyrian, Acima.[16]\r\n\r\nThe Book of Judges has not furnished many names to collective Europe.\r\nCaleb, the faithful spy, who alone finally accompanied Joshua into the\r\nLand of Promise out of all the 600,000 who had come out of Egypt, had a\r\nname meaning a dog, seldom copied except by the Puritan taste, and only\r\nmeeting in one language a personal name of similar signification,\r\nnamely, the Irish _cu_ (gen.) _con_.\r\n\r\nCaleb’s daughter, Achsah, probably from the shortness and pretty sound\r\nof her name, which means a tinkling ornament for the ancle, has a good\r\nmany namesakes in remote village schools, where it is apt to be spelt\r\nAxah. Tirzah (pleasantness) was one of those five daughters of\r\nZelophehad, whose heiresship occupies two chapters of the Book of\r\nNumbers. She probably was the origin of Thirza, the name of Abel’s wife\r\nin Gessner’s idyll of the _Death of Abel_, a great favourite among the\r\nlower classes in England, whence Thyrza has become rather a favourite in\r\nEnglish cottages.\r\n\r\nGideon (a feller or destroyer) seems by his martial exploits to have\r\nobtained some admirers among the Huguenots of the civil wars of France,\r\nfor Gédéon was in some small use among them.\r\n\r\nThe name of the mighty Nazarene, whose strength was in his hair, is not\r\nclearly explained. Schimschon seems best to represent the Hebrew sound,\r\nbut the Greek had made it Σαμψσων; and our translation, Samson. Some\r\ntranslate it splendid son, others as the diminutive of sun.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church and her British daughter did not forget the mighty man\r\nof valour, and Samson was an early Welsh Bishop and saint, from whom\r\nthis became a monastic appellation, as in the instance of Mr. Carlyle’s\r\nfavourite Abbot Samson. The French still call it Simson, which is\r\nperhaps more like the original; and our Simpson and Simkins may thus be\r\nderived from it, when they do not come from Simon, which was much more\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nThe name of the gentle and faithful Ruth has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. Some make it mean trembling; others derive it from a word\r\nmeaning to join together; and others from Reûth (beauty), which is\r\nperhaps the best account of it. In spite of the touching sweetness of\r\nher history, Ruth’s name has never been in vogue, except under the\r\ninfluence of our English version of the Bible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this may be the fittest place to mention the prevalence of names\r\ntaken from the river Jordan during the period of pilgrimages. The Jordan\r\nitself is named from Jared (to descend), and perhaps no river does\r\ndescend more rapidly throughout its entire course than does this most\r\nnoted stream, from its rise in the range of Libanus to its fall in the\r\nDead Sea, the lowest water in the world. To bathe in the Jordan was one\r\nof the objects of pilgrims, and flasks of its water were brought home to\r\nbe used at baptisms—as was done for the present family of Royal\r\nchildren. It was probably this custom that led to the adoption of Jordan\r\nas a baptismal name, and it is to be supposed that it was a fashion of\r\nthe Normans, since it certainly prevailed in countries that they had\r\noccupied. In Calabria, Count Giordano Lancia was the friend of the\r\nunfortunate Manfred of Sicily, and recognized his corpse. Jourdain was\r\nused in France, though in what districts I do not know, and Jordan was\r\nat one time recognized in England. Jordan de Thornhill died in 1200;\r\nJordan de Dalden was at the battle of Lewes in 1264, and two namesakes\r\nof his are mentioned in the pedigree of his family. Jordan de Exeter was\r\nthe founder of a family in Connaught, who became so thoroughly\r\nHibernicized, that, after a few generations, they adopted the surname\r\nof, Mac Jordan. Galileo dei Gailïlei probably took both his names from\r\nGalilee, which comes from _Galil_, a circle.\r\n\r\nBethlem Gabor will seem to the mind as an instance of Bethlehem (the\r\nplace of bread), having furnished Christian names for the sake of its\r\nassociations, and Nazarene has also been used in Germany.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Pusey’s _Commentary on the Prophets_; Kitto’s _Biblical\r\n  Dictionary_; Jameson’s _Legends of the Madonna_; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION V.—_Names from Chaanach._\r\n\r\nPerhaps no word has given rise to a more curious class of derivatives\r\nthan this from the Hebrew Chaanach, with the aspirate at each end,\r\nsignifying favour, or mercy, or grace.\r\n\r\nTo us it first becomes known in the form of Hannah, the mother of\r\nSamuel, and it was also used with the Divine syllable in the masculine,\r\nas Hananeel, Hanani, Hananiah, or Jehohanan, shortened into Johanan.\r\n\r\nExactly the same names were current among the Phœœœœœœnicians, only we\r\nhave received them through a Greek or Latin medium. Anna, the companion\r\nsister of Dido, was no doubt Hannah, and becoming known to the Romans\r\nthrough the worship paid to her and Elisa by the Carthaginians, was,\r\nfrom similarity of sound, confused by them with their Italian goddess,\r\nAnna Perenna, the presiding deity of the circling year (_Annus_).\r\nVirgil, by-and-by, wove the traditions of the foundation of Carthage,\r\nand the death of Dido, into the adventures of Æneas; and a further fancy\r\narose among the Romans that after the self-destruction of Dido, Anna had\r\nactually pursued the faithless Trojan to Italy, and there drowned\r\nherself in the river Numicius, where she became a presiding nymph as\r\nAnna Perenna! A fine instance of the Romans' habit of spoiling their own\r\nmythology and that of every one else! Oddly enough, an Anna has arisen\r\nin Ireland by somewhat the same process. The river Liffey is there said\r\nto owe its name to Lifé, the daughter of the chief of the Firbolg race\r\nbeing there drowned. In Erse, the word for river was Amhain, the same as\r\nour Avon; but on English tongues Amhain Lifé became Anna Liffey, and was\r\nsupposed to be the lady’s name; another version declared that it was\r\nLifé, the horse of Heremon the Milesian, who there perished.\r\n\r\nHanno, so often occurring in the Punic wars, was another version of the\r\nHebrew Hanan, and the far-famed Hannibal himself answered exactly to the\r\nHananiah or Johanan of the Holy Land, saying that it was the grace of\r\nBaal that unhappily he besought by his very appellation. The Greeks\r\ncalled him Annibas, and the Romans wavered between Annibal and Hannibal\r\nas the designation of their great enemy. In the latter times of Rome,\r\nwhen the hereditary prænomina were discarded, Annibal and Annibalianus\r\nwere given among the grand sounds that mocked their feeble wearers, and\r\nAnnibale lingered on in Italy, so as to be known to us in the person of\r\nAnnibale Caracci.\r\n\r\nIt is a more curious fact, however, that Hannibal has always been a\r\nfavourite with the peasantry of Cornwall. From the first dawn of parish\r\nregisters Hannyball is of constant occurrence, much too early, even in\r\nthat intelligent county, to be a mere gleaning from books; and the west\r\ncountry surname of Honeyball must surely be from the same source. A few\r\nother eastern names, though none of them as frequent or as clearly\r\ntraced as the present, have remained in use in this remote county, and\r\nought to be allowed due weight in favour of the supposed influence of\r\nthe Phœnician traders over the races that supplied them with tin and\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nThe usual changes were at work upon the Jewish names Hannah and\r\nHananiah. Greek had made the first 'Anna, the second Ananias, or Annas.\r\nIndeed Hannah is only known, as such, to the readers of the English\r\nversion of the Bible, from whom the Irish have taken it to represent\r\ntheir native Ainè (joy). All the rest of Europe calls her, as well as\r\nthe aged prophetess in the temple, Anne.\r\n\r\nThe apocryphal Gospels which gave an account of the childhood of the\r\nBlessed Virgin, called her mother Anna, though from what tradition is\r\nnot known. St. Anna was a favourite with the Byzantines from very early\r\ntimes; the Emperor Justinian built a church to her in 550, and in 710\r\nher relics were there enshrined. From that time forward Greek damsels,\r\nand all those of the adjoining nations who looked to Constantinople as\r\ntheir head, were apt to be christened Anna. In 988, a daughter of the\r\nEmperor Basil married and converted Vladimir, Grand Prince of Muscovy,\r\nwhence date all the numerous Russian Annas, with their pretty changes of\r\nendearment. The grand-daughter of this lady, Anne of Muscovy, sister of\r\nHarald Hardrada’s Elisif, carried her name to France, where it grew and\r\nflourished.\r\n\r\nSt. Anne became the patron saint of Prague, where a prodigious festival\r\nis yearly holden in her honour, and great are the rejoicings of all the\r\nfemales who hear her name, and who are not a few. It was from Prague\r\nthat the Bohemian princess, Anne of Luxemburg, brought it to England,\r\nand gave it to her name-child, Anne Mortimer, by whom it was carried to\r\nthe house of York, then to the Howards, from them to Anne Boleyn, and\r\nthereby became an almost party word in England.\r\n\r\nAbroad it had a fresh access of popularity from a supposed appearance of\r\nthe saint to two children at Auray, in Brittany, and not only was the\r\nBretonne heiress, twice Queen of France, so named, but she transferred\r\nthe name to her god-sons, among whom the most notable was the fierce\r\nConstable, Anne de Montmorency. Her Italian god-daughter, Anna d'Este,\r\nbrought it back to the House of Guise, and shortly after a decree from\r\nRome, in 1584, made the name more popular still by rendering the feast\r\nobligatory, and thenceforth arose the fashion of giving the names of the\r\nBlessed Virgin and her mother in combination, as Anne Marie, or\r\nMarianne. This is usually the source of the Marianne, Mariana, or Manna,\r\nso often found on the continent; in England, Marianne is generally only\r\na corruption of Marion, and Anna Maria is in imitation of the Italian.\r\n\r\nHardly susceptible of abbreviation, no name has undergone more varieties\r\nof endearment, some forms almost being treated like independent names,\r\nsuch as the Annot of Scotland, an imitation of the French Annette,\r\nshowing the old connection between France and Scotland; and in the\r\npresent day, there has arisen a fashion of christening Annie, probably\r\nfrom some confusion as to the spelling of Ann or Anne.\r\n\r\nAll these Annes can distinctly be traced from the Byzantine devotion to\r\nthe mother of the Blessed Virgin spreading westwards, and at Rome\r\nmagnified by Mariolatry. There are however what seem like forms of Anne\r\nin the West before the adoption of the name from Russia and Bohemia.\r\nWelsh Angharawd (far from shame), which is treated as Anne’s equivalent.\r\nThe Scottish Annaple and Annabella are likewise too early to come from\r\nSt. Anne, and are probably either from Ainè (joy), a favourite name in\r\nearly Gaelic times, or from the Teutonic Arnhilda—Eagle heroine.\r\n\r\nAnnabella by no means is to be explained to mean fair Anna, as is\r\ngenerally supposed. _Bellus_ did, indeed, signify handsome in Latin, and\r\nbecame the _beau_ and _belle_ of French, but the habit of putting it at\r\nthe end of a name, by way of ornament, was not invented till the late\r\nperiod of seven-leagued names of literature. Annys, or Anisia, is a\r\nseparate name with a saint in the Greek calendar, and was used in\r\nEngland from the Norman Conquest down at least to 1690. Mr. Bardsley\r\nthinks, however, that this was really Agnes; and certainly the\r\nunfortunate Scotchwoman, who was supposed to have raised the tempest\r\nbefore the wedding of James VI., is called indifferently Agnes or Annis\r\nSimpson.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │  French.   │  Spanish.  │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Hannah      │Hannah      │Anne        │Ana         │Anna        │\r\n   │Anna        │Anne        │Annette     │Anita       │Annica      │\r\n   │Anne        │Nannie      │Nanette     │            │Nanna       │\r\n   │Nan         │Annot       │Nanon       │            │Ninetta     │\r\n   │Nancy       │            │Ninon       │            │            │\r\n   │Nanny       │            │Ninette     │            │            │\r\n   │            │            │Nichon      │            │            │\r\n   │            │            │Nillon      │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  German.   │   Dutch.   │  Danish.   │   Swiss.   │ Bavarian.  │\r\n   │Anne        │Anna        │Anna        │Anne        │Anne        │\r\n   │Annchen     │Antje       │Annika      │Annali      │Annerl      │\r\n   │            │Naatje      │            │Nann        │Nannerl     │\r\n   │            │Annechet    │            │Nanneli     │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │ Bohemian.  │  Russian.  │  Servian.  │ Lusatian.  │   Lett.    │\r\n   │Ana         │Anna        │Anna        │Anna        │Anne        │\r\n   │Ancika      │Anninka     │Anuschka    │Hanna       │Annusche    │\r\n   │Anca        │Anjuska     │Aneta       │Hanzyzka    │            │\r\n   │            │Anjutka     │Anica       │Hancicka    │            │\r\n   │            │Annuschka   │Anicsika    │            │            │\r\n   │            │            │Anka        │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┴────────────┼────────────┴────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │       Lithuanian.       │       Hungarian.        │  Polish.   │\r\n   │Ane         │Annze       │Anna        │Panni       │Anna        │\r\n   │Anikke      │            │Nani        │Panna       │Anusia      │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nἸώαννα, or Ἰαννης, for the masculine, Ἰώαννα for the feminine, were\r\nalready frequent among the natives of Judea, though they appear not to\r\nhave been used in the family of Zacharias when he was commanded so to\r\ncall his son.\r\n\r\nThe Evangelist who was surnamed Mark, and Joanna the wife of Herod’s\r\nsteward, both had received their names independently, and thus Joannes\r\nbecame a most universal baptismal name, given from the first in the East\r\nand at Rome. There were many noted bishops so called in the fourth\r\ncentury, the earliest time when men began to be baptized in memory of\r\ndeparted saints, rather than by the old Roman names. The first whose\r\nname is preserved is Joannes of Egypt, one of the hermits of the\r\nThebaïd; the next is the great deacon of Antioch, and patron of\r\nConstantinople, Joannes Chrysostomos (John of the golden mouth), whose\r\nGreek surname, given him for his eloquence, has caused him to be best\r\nknown as St. Chrysostom, and has perpetuated in Italy, Grisostomo; in\r\nSpain, Crisostomo; whilst the Slavonian nations translate the name and\r\nmake it Zlatoust.\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople, the patriarch St. Joannes the Silent, at Rome, the\r\nmartyr Pope St. Johannes I., at Alexandria, the beneficent patriarch St.\r\nJoannes the Almoner, all renewed the popularity of their name. The last\r\nmentioned was originally the patron of the order of Hospitallers, though\r\nwhen these Franks were living at enmity to the Greek Church, they\r\ndiscarded him in favour of the Baptist. Each of the two Scriptural\r\nsaints had two holidays,—the Baptist on the day of his nativity, and of\r\nhis decollation; the Evangelist, on the 27th of December, as well as on\r\nthe 6th of May, in remembrance of his confession in the cauldron of\r\nboiling oil.\r\n\r\nThus the festivals were so numerous that children had an extra chance of\r\nthe name, which the Italians called Giovanni, or for short, Vanni; and\r\nthe French, Jehan.\r\n\r\nIt was still so infrequent at the time of the Norman Conquest, that\r\namong the under-tenants in Domesday Book, to 68 Williams, 48 Roberts,\r\nand 28 Walters, there are only 10 Johns, but it was flourishing in the\r\nEastern Church, where one of the Komneni was called, some say from his\r\nbeauty, others from the reverse, Kaloioannes, or handsome John, a form\r\nwhich was adopted bodily by his descendants, the Komneni of Trebizond.\r\n\r\nIt had come into Ireland at first as Maol-Eoin (shaveling, or disciple\r\nof John), the Baptist sharing with St. Patrick the patronage of the\r\nisland; but Shawn or Seoin soon prevailed in Ireland, as did Ian in\r\nScotland; but not till the Crusades did French or English adopt it to\r\nany great extent, or the English begin to Anglicize it in general by\r\ncontracting the word and writing it John.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of the English Lackland and of the French captive of\r\nPoictiers caused a superstition that theirs was an ill-omened royal\r\nname, and when John Stuart came to the Scottish throne, he termed\r\nhimself Robert III., without, however, averting the doom of his still\r\nmore unhappy surname. It did not fare amiss with any Castilian Juan or\r\nPortuguese Joâo; and in Bohemia a new saint arose called Johanko von\r\nNepomuk, the Empress’s confessor, who was thrown from the bridge of\r\nPrague by the insane Emperor Wenzel for refusing to betray her secrets.\r\n\r\nAs St. Nepomucene, he had a few local namesakes, who get called Mukki or\r\nMukkel. The original word is said to mean helpless.\r\n\r\nDouble names, perhaps, originated in the desire to indicate the\r\nindividual patron, where there were many saints of similar name, and\r\nthus the votaries of the Baptist were christened Gian Battista, or Jean\r\nBaptiste, but only called by the second Greek title—most common in\r\nItaly—least so in England.\r\n\r\n  ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐\r\n  │ English. │ French.  │ Spanish. │ Italian. │  Swiss.  │ Polish.  │\r\n  │Baptist   │Baptiste  │Bautista  │Battista  │Bisch     │Baptysta  │\r\n  │          │Batiste   │          │          │Bischli   │          │\r\n  └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Illyrians, using the word for christianizing instead of that for\r\nbaptizing, make the namesakes of the Baptist Kerstiteli.\r\n\r\nIt was probably in honour of St. John the Evangelist’s guardianship of\r\nthe Blessed Virgin that her name became commonly joined with his.\r\nGiovanni Maria Visconti of Milan, appears in the fifth century, and Juan\r\nMaria and Jean Marie soon followed in Spain and France.\r\n\r\nJohann was the correct German form, usually contracted into Hans; and it\r\nwas the same in Sweden, where Johann I., in 1483, was known as King\r\nHans; and in Norway, Hans and Jens, though both abbreviations of Johan,\r\nare used as distinct names, and have formed the patronymics, Hanson and\r\nJensen, the first of which has become an English surname. Ivan the\r\nTerrible, Tzar of Muscovy, was the first prince there so called, though\r\nthe name is frequent among all ranks, and the sons and daughters are\r\ncalled Ivanovitch and Ivanovna.\r\n\r\nRare as patronymic surnames are in France, this universal name has there\r\nproduced Johannot, while the contraction is Jeannot, answering to the\r\nSpanish Juanito and the patronymic Juanez. Jan is very frequent in\r\nBrittany, where the diminutive is Jannik.\r\n\r\nJock is the recognized Scottish abbreviation, and it would seem to have\r\nbeen the older English one according to the warning to Jockey of\r\nNorfolk, at Bosworth. Jack sounds much as if the French Jacques had been\r\nhis true parent; but “sweet Jack Falstaff, old Jack Falstaff” has made\r\nit alienable from John.\r\n\r\nThough Joanna was a holy woman of the Gospel, her name did not come into\r\nfavour so early as the male form, and it is likely that it was adopted\r\nrather in honour of one of the St. Johns than of herself, since she is\r\nnot canonized; and to the thirty feasts of the St. Johns, in the Roman\r\ncalendar, there are only two in honour of Joannas, and these very late\r\nones, when the name was rather slipping out of fashion. Its use seems to\r\nhave begun all at once, in the twelfth century, in the south of France\r\nand Navarre, whence ladies called Juana in Spanish, Jehanne or Jeanne in\r\nFrance, came forth, and married into all the royal families of the time.\r\nOur first princess so called was daughter to Henry II., and married into\r\nSicily; and almost every king had a daughter Joan, or Jhone, as they\r\npreferred spelling it. Joan Makepeace was the name given to the daughter\r\nof Edward II., when the long war with the Bruces was partly pacified by\r\nher marriage; and Joan Beaufort was the maiden romantically beloved by\r\nthe captive James I. The Scots, however, usually called the name Jean,\r\nand adopted Janet from the French Jeanette, like Annot from Annette.\r\n\r\nThe various forms and contractions are infinite:—\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │   Welsh.   │  Breton.   │  Gaelic.   │\r\n   │John        │John        │Jan         │Jan         │Ian         │\r\n   │Johnny      │Johnnie     │Jenkin      │Jannik      │            │\r\n   │Jack        │Jock        │            │            │            │\r\n   │Jenkin      │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │   Erse.    │  German.   │  Danish.   │   Dutch.   │  Belgian.  │\r\n   │Shawn       │Johannes    │Johan       │Jan         │Jehan       │\r\n   │Eoin        │Hans        │Janne       │Jantje      │Jan         │\r\n   │            │Hanschen    │Jens        │            │Hannes      │\r\n   │            │            │Hans        │            │Hanneken    │\r\n   │            │            │Jantje      │            │Hanka       │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │ Bavarian.  │   Swiss.   │  French.   │  Spanish.  │Portuguese. │\r\n   │Johan       │Johan       │Jean        │Juan        │Joao        │\r\n   │Hansl       │Han         │Jeanno      │Juanito     │Joaninho    │\r\n   │            │Hansli      │Jehan—_old_ │            │Joanico     │\r\n   │            │Hasli       │            │            │Joaozinho   │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Italian.  │Modern Greek│  Russian.  │  Polish.   │ Bohemian.  │\r\n   │Giovanni    │Ιωαννης     │Ivan        │Jan         │Jan         │\r\n   │Gianni      │Jannes      │Vanja       │Janek       │            │\r\n   │Gian        │Giannes     │Vanka       │            │            │\r\n   │Giovanoli   │Giankos     │Ivanjuschka │            │            │\r\n   │Giannino    │Giannakes   │Vanjuschka  │            │            │\r\n   │Vanni       │Joannoulos  │Vanjucha    │            │            │\r\n   │Nanni       │Nannos      │            │            │            │\r\n   │Gianozzo    │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │ Slavonic.  │ Illyrian.  │   Lett.    │Lithuanian. │ Esthonian. │\r\n   │Jovan       │Jovan       │Janis       │Jonas       │Johan       │\r\n   │Ivan        │Jovica      │Janke       │Ancas       │Hannus      │\r\n   │Janez       │Jvo         │Ans         │Jonkus      │Ants        │\r\n   │            │Jveica      │Ansis       │Jonkutti    │            │\r\n   │            │Jvic        │            │Enseliss    │            │\r\n   │            │            │            │Enskis      │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┴────────────┴────────────┤\r\n   │ Hungarian. │   Lapp.    │                                      │\r\n   │Janos       │Jofan       │                                      │\r\n   │Jani        │Jofa        │                                      │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nJessie, though now a separate name, is said to be short for Janet.

It was Δαυὶδ in the Septuagint;\r\nΔαβὶδ and Δαυεὶδ in the New Testament; and the Vulgate made it the name\r\nwell known to us.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Church, in which the ancient Scriptural names were in\r\ngreater honour than in the West, seems to have adopted David among her\r\nnames long before it was revived among the Jews, who never seem to have\r\nused it since the days of their dispersion. It has always been common\r\namong the Armenians and Georgians. Daveed is frequent in Russia, in\r\nhonour of a saint, who has his feast on the 29th of July; and in\r\nSlavonic it is shortened into Dako; in Esthonia it is Taved; in Lusatia,\r\nDabko.\r\n\r\nThe influence of eastern Christianity is traceable in the adoption of\r\nDavid in the Keltic Church. Early in the 6th century, a Welshman of\r\nprincely birth (like almost all Welsh saints), by name David, or\r\nDawfydd, lived in such sanctity at his bishopric of Menevia, that it has\r\never since been known as St. David’s, the principal Welsh see having\r\nbeen there transplanted from Caerleon in his time. Dewi was the\r\nvernacular alteration of his name, and the Church of Llan Dewi Brevi\r\ncommemorates a synod held by him against the Pelagians. Dafod, or Devi,\r\nthus grew popular in Wales, and when ap Devi ceased to be the\r\ndistinction of the sons of David—Davy, Davis, and Davies became the\r\nsurname, Taffy the contraction, and Tafline or Vida the feminine. The\r\nKeltic bishop was revered likewise in Scotland, and his name was\r\nconferred upon the third son of Malcolm Ceanmohr, the best sovereign\r\nwhom Scotland ever possessed, and whom she deservedly canonized,\r\nalthough his Protestant descendant James VI. called him “a sore saint to\r\nthe crown,” because of his large donations of land to the clergy—at that\r\ntime the only orderly subjects in the country. Affection and honour for\r\nthe royal saint filled the Lowlands with Davids, and this has continued\r\na distinctively Scottish name.\r\n\r\nThe Anglicizing Irish took David as the synonym of Dathi (far darting);\r\nand Diarmaid (a freeman); and the Danes made it serve for Dagfinn (day\r\nwhite).[17]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Rees, _Welsh Saints_; Jones, _Welsh\r\n  Sketches_; O'Donovan, _Irish Names_; _Seven Champions of Christendom_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VII.—_Salem._\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable to observe how the longing for peace is expressed in\r\nthe names of almost every nation. The warlike Roman may be an exception,\r\nbut the Greek had his Eireneos; the German, his Friedrich; the Kelt, his\r\nSimaith; the Slave, his Lubomirski; testifying that even in the midst of\r\nwar, there was a longing after peace and rest! And, above all, would\r\nthis be the case with the Hebrew, to whom sitting safely and at peace,\r\nbeneath his own vine and his own fig-tree, was the summit of earthly\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nSchalem (peace)! By the Prophet-King it was bestowed upon the two sons\r\nto whom he looked for the continuance of his throne, and the continuance\r\nof the promises of ‘peace,’—Absalom (father of peace), and afterwards\r\nwith a truer presage, Salomo, or Solomon, (the peaceful)!\r\n\r\nLong before his time, however, Welsh and Breton saints had been called\r\nSolomon, as well as one early Armorican prince; and likewise an idiot\r\nboy, who lived under a tree at Auray, only quitting it when in want of\r\nfood, to wander through the villages muttering “Salaum hungry”—the only\r\nwords, except _Ave Maria_, that he could pronounce. When he died, the\r\nneighbours, thinking him as soulless as a dog, buried him under his\r\ntree; but, according to the legend, their contempt was rebuked by a\r\nbeauteous lily springing from his grave, and bearing on every leaf the\r\nwords _Ave Maria_. Certain it is that an exquisite church was there\r\nerected, containing the shrine of Salaun the Simple, who thus became a\r\npopular saint of Brittany, ensuring tender reverence for those who, if\r\nmindless, were likewise sinless, and obtaining a few namesakes.\r\n\r\nSalomon and Salomone are the French and Italian forms; and Solomon is so\r\nfrequent among the Jews as to have become a surname.\r\n\r\nRussia and Poland both use it, and have given it the feminines,\r\nSsolominija and Salomea; but Schalem had already formed a true feminine\r\nname of its own, well known in Arabic literature as Suleima, Selma, or\r\nSelima.\r\n\r\nBut returning to the high associations whence the names of Christians\r\nshould take their source, we find Salome honoured indeed as one of the\r\nwomen first at the sepulchre; and it is surprising that thus\r\nrecommended, her name should not have been more frequent. It sometimes\r\ndoes occur in England, and Salomée is known in France; but it is nowhere\r\nreally popular except in Switzerland, where, oddly enough, Salomeli is\r\nthe form for the unmarried, and Salome is restricted to the wife.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark, similarity of sound led Solomon to be chosen as the\r\necclesiastical name, so to speak, of persons whose genuine appellation\r\nwas Solmund, or sun’s protection. Perhaps it was in consequence that the\r\nLord Mayor of London, of 1216, obtained the name of Solomon de Basing.\r\nThe county of Cornwall much later shows a Soloma.[18] It is a question\r\nwhether Lemuel be another name for Solomon. It means “to God,” or\r\n“dedicated to God,” and was a favourite at one time with Puritan\r\nmothers. Swift made it famous; but Lemuel Gulliver was by no means an\r\nimprobable north country name, and Lemuel is not wholly disused even\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Souvestre, _Derniers Bretons_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SECTION VIII.—_Later Israelite Names._\r\n\r\nBy the time the kingdom was established most of the Israelite names were\r\nbecoming repetitions of former ones, and comparatively few fresh ones\r\ncome to light, though there are a few sufficiently used to be worth\r\ncursorily noting down.\r\n\r\nHezekiah meant strength of the Lord, and in the Greek became Ezekias.\r\nEzekiel is like it, meaning God will strengthen. The great prophet who\r\nwas the chief glory of Hezekiah’s reign was Isaiah (the salvation of the\r\nLord), made by Greek translators into Esaias, and thence called by old\r\nFrench and English, Esaie, or Esay. The Russians, who have all the old\r\nprophetic names, have Eesaia; but it is not easy to account for the\r\nchoice of Ysaie le Triste as the name of the child of Tristram and\r\nYseulte in the romance that carried on their history to another\r\ngeneration, unless we suppose that Ysaie was supposed to be the\r\nmasculine of Yseulte! the one being Hebrew, and meaning as above, the\r\nother Keltic, and meaning a sight.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Hezekiah, and persecuted by the Assyrian monarch when\r\nhe returned to Nineveh after the miraculous destruction of his host, was\r\nthe blind Israelite of the captivity whose name is explained to have\r\nbeen probably Tobijah (the goodness of the Lord), a name occurring again\r\nin the prophet Zechariah, and belonging afterwards to one of the\r\nSamaritan persecutors. Probably, in Greek, came the variation of the\r\nnames of the father and son; perhaps the latter was once meant for\r\nTobides, the son of Tobias.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous element in the book of Tobit gained for it much\r\npopularity; scenes from it appeared in art. Thus Tobias had a diffusion\r\nin the later middle ages much greater than the names of his\r\ncontemporaries of far more certain history, and in Ireland Toby has\r\nenjoyed the honour, together with Thaddeus and Timothy, of figuring as\r\nan equivalent for Tadgh, a poet.\r\n\r\n ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n │ English. │ French.  │  Swiss.  │ Hamburg. │  Italian.  │  Russian.  │\r\n │Tobias    │Tobie     │Tobies    │Tewes     │Tobia       │Tobija      │\r\n │Tobit     │          │Tebes     │          │            │Tobej       │\r\n │Toby      │          │Tebos     │          │            │            │\r\n │          │          │Beiali    │          │            │            │\r\n └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nHephzibah (my delight is in her), was the wife of Hezekiah, and it may\r\nhave been in allusion to her that Isaiah spoke of the land being called\r\nHephsibah. It has been rather a favourite name in America, where it gets\r\nturned into Hepsy.\r\n\r\nAs Judah sinned more and more and her fate drew on, Jeremiah stood forth\r\nas her leading prophet. His name meant exalted of the Lord, and became\r\nJeremias in the Greek, Jeremy in vernacular English. As the name of some\r\nof the early eastern saints it has had a partial irregular sort of use\r\nin the West, and is adopted direct from the prophet in the\r\nGreco-Slavonic Churches. The French, struck by the mournful strain of\r\nthe prophet, use Jeremiade to express a lamentation; and the English are\r\nrather too ready to follow their example. Jeremy is considered as\r\nanother variety of equivalent for the Gaelic Diarmaid, and this has led\r\nto the frequency of Jerry among families of Irish connection. In\r\nSwitzerland, Jeremias is contracted into Meies or Mies; in Russia it is\r\nJeremija; but nowhere has it been so illustrious in modern times as in\r\nthe person of our own Jeremy Taylor. The king whom Jeremiah saw led into\r\ncaptivity was Zedekiah (justice of the Lord).\r\n\r\nThe prophet of the captivity, Daniel, bore in his name an amplification\r\nof that of Dan (a judge). The termination signified God the judge, and\r\nthe alias Belteshazzar, imposed upon him by the Chaldean monarch, is\r\nconsidered to translate and heathenize the name, making Bel the judge.\r\nIt is observable that Daniel never calls himself thus, though he gives\r\nthese heathen titles to his three companions.\r\n\r\nDaniel has always flourished as a name in the East. Daniel and Verda (a\r\nrose), were martyred by Shapoor in 344; another Daniel was crazy enough\r\nto succeed Simeon Stylites on his pillar; and thus the Armenian,\r\nMontenegrin, and Slavonian races are all much attached to Daniela, or\r\nDaniil, as they call it in Russia; or in Esthonia, Taniel or Tanni. The\r\nWelsh adopted it as Deiniol, the name of the saint who founded the\r\nmonastery of Bangor, the High Choir, in the sixth century, and it was\r\nthus known to the Bretons; and in Ireland it was adopted as the\r\nequivalent to Domnall, Donacha, and other names from Don (or\r\nbrown-haired), thus causing Dan to be one of the most frequent of Irish\r\ncontractions.\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome “transfixed with a dagger”—with his pen—the additional\r\nchapters of the Book of Daniel relating to the story of Susanna, to show\r\nthat he did not regard it as genuine, but, like the story of Judith, it\r\nwas greatly more popular than the narratives in the canonical books, and\r\nwas commemorated in ballad, mystery, tapestry, and painting. The name\r\nwas properly Schuschannah (a lily), though we know it as Susannah. It\r\nbelonged to one of the holy women at the sepulchre, and it was likewise\r\nin the calendar, for two virgin martyrs, named Susanna, had suffered in\r\nthe times of persecution, and though not commemorated in the Western\r\nChurch, Queen Susanna, the “Lily of Tiflis,” had died for the truth in\r\nthe hands of Mahometans. The name has been chiefly popular in France and\r\nSwitzerland, as in England. The Swiss contraction, Züsí-Ketti, for\r\nSusanne-Catherine, is quaint.[19]\r\n\r\n           ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n           │   English.    │    German.    │   Bavarian    │\r\n           │Susannah       │Susanne        │Susanne        │\r\n           │Susan          │Suschen        │Sanrl          │\r\n           │Susie          │Suse           │Sandrl         │\r\n           │Sukey          │               │               │\r\n           │Sue            │               │               │\r\n           ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n           │    Swiss.     │    French.    │  Lithuanian.  │\r\n           │Susanne        │Susanne        │Zuzane         │\r\n           │Zosa           │Suzette        │               │\r\n           │Zosel          │Suzon          │               │\r\n           │Zösel          │               │               │\r\n           └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThis may be the best place to mention the Aramean Tabitha, explained by\r\nSt. Luke as the same as Dorcas (a roe or gazelle), the Greek word being\r\nfrom its full dark eye. Tabitha and Dorcas both have associations\r\nunsuited to the “dear gazelle.” As the charitable disciple raised by St.\r\nPeter, her names were endeared to the Puritans.\r\n\r\nOf the minor prophets, the names have been little employed. Joel meant\r\nstrong-willed; Amos, a burthen; Obadiah, servant of the Lord, has been\r\nslightly more popular, perhaps, in honour of him who hid the prophets in\r\na cave, with whom the mediæval imagination confounded the prophet, so\r\nthat loaves of bread are the emblem of Obadiah in ancient pictures of\r\nthe twelve prophets. Even the Abbacuc, as the Apocrypha calls him, who,\r\nin the story of _Bel and the Dragon_ is carried off by the hair to feed\r\nDaniel in the den of lions, seems to have been likewise supposed to be\r\nthe same person in the strange notions of Scripture history that once\r\nfloated among our forefathers. The name of Abacuck, or Habbakkuk, was\r\nconferred upon a child by one of the last persons one would have\r\nsuspected of such a choice, namely, Mary, Queen of Scots. On her way to\r\nmass, she was waylaid by one of her caterers, who acquainted her that he\r\nhad a child to be baptized, and desired her to give the name. “She said\r\nshe would open the Bible in the chapel, and whatever name she cast up,\r\nthat should be given to the child;” and for the child’s misfortune it\r\nproved to be ‘Abacuck!’ The name comes from the verb to clasp, and means\r\nembracing.\r\n\r\nMicah is a contraction of Micaiah, and means “Who is like unto the\r\nLord.” Nahum—to us connected with “Tate and Brady”—was consolation;\r\nNehemiah expanded it, adding the Divine termination; Zephaniah is,\r\nprotected of the Lord; Haggai (festival of the Lord), called Aggae, when\r\nbrought through a Greek medium, is rather a favourite in Russia.\r\n\r\nZachariah (remembrance of the Lord), has been more in favour. After\r\nbelonging to a king of Israel and to the priest murdered by King\r\nJehoash, it came forth after the captivity as Zechariah with the\r\nprophet; and in the New Testament, as Zacharias, names the father of the\r\nBaptist; and the mysterious martyr who was to fill up the measure of the\r\niniquity of the Jews; and again appears as Zaccheus, the publican of\r\nJericho. It was rather frequent among Eastern Christians, and belonged\r\nto the pope who first invited the Franks into Italy to protect him from\r\nthe Lombards; nor has it ever quite died away in the West, although\r\nnowhere popular.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Zacharias      │Zacharie       │Zaccaria       │Sakerl         │\r\n   │Zachary        │               │               │               │\r\n   │Zach           │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Bavarian.   │   Russian.    │   Slavonic.   │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Zachereis      │Sacharija      │               │Sakarie        │\r\n   │Zacherl        │Sachar         │Charija        │Zaro           │\r\n   │Zacher         │               │               │Zako           │\r\n   │Zaches         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Zach           │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nOf those to whom these later prophets were sent, Ezra’s name is thought\r\nto be the same as that of Zerah, son of Judah, the rising of light, from\r\nwhom likewise Heman, the writer of the 88th Psalm, is termed the\r\nEzrahite. The name of Ezra is hardly to be recognized in that of Esdras,\r\nas the Greek translators rendered it.[20] The house of Aphrah, mentioned\r\nin the Prophet Micah, means the house of dust, or ashes, and the\r\nPuritans, with their love of piteous names, adopted Aphra as a name. As\r\nwell it appears as ‘Dust’ and ‘Ashes’ in actual English.[21]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Jones, _Welsh Sketches_; Michaelis;\r\n  O'Donovan; Butler.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  _Proper Names of the Bible_; Michaelis; Chambers, _Records of\r\n  Scotland_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Bardsley, _Puritan Nomenclature_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION IX.—_Angelic Names._\r\n\r\nWe have thrown these together, because, though our common term for those\r\nspiritual messengers is Greek, yet all the other words for them, as well\r\nas the three individual angelic designations that have come into use as\r\nbaptismal names, are derived from the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the first of these belonged to the last of the prophets,\r\nMalach-jah, the angel or messenger of God. It has even been thought by\r\nsome commentators that this title of the prophet was the quotation of\r\nhis own words, “Behold, I send my messenger (or Malachi) before my\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nMalachi would never have been a modern name, but for the Irish fancy\r\nthat made it the equivalent of Maelseachlain, the disciple of St.\r\nSechnall, or Secundus, a companion of St. Patrick; and as the era of him\r\nwho is now called King Malachi with the collar of gold, was particularly\r\nprosperous, the name has come into some amount of popularity.\r\n\r\nThe Septuagint always translated Malach by Ἀγγελος, even in that first\r\nsentence of the prophet, which in our version bears his name. Angelos\r\nhad simply meant a messenger in Greek, as it still does; but it acquired\r\nthe especial signification of a heavenly messenger, both in its own\r\ntongue, and in the Latin, whither Angelus was transplanted with this and\r\nno other sense.\r\n\r\nAngelos first became a name in the Byzantine Empire. It probably began\r\nas an epithet, since it comes to light in the person of Konstantinos\r\nAngelos, a young man of a noble family of Philadelphia, whose personal\r\nbeauty caused him, about the year 1100, to become the choice of the\r\nPrincess Theodora Komnena. It is thus highly probable that Angelos was\r\nfirst bestowed as a surname, on account of the beauty of the family.\r\nThey were on the throne in 1185, and Angelos continued imperial till the\r\nmiserable end of the unhappy Isaac, and his son, Alexios, during the\r\nmisdirected crusade of the Venetians. Angelos thus became known among\r\nthe Greeks; and somewhere about 1217, there came a monastic saint, so\r\ncalled, to Sicily, who preached at Palermo, and was murdered by a wicked\r\ncount, whose evil doings he had rebuked. The Carmelites claimed St.\r\nAngelo as a saint of their order, and his name, both masculine and\r\nfeminine, took hold of the fancy of Italy, varied by the Neapolitan\r\ndialect into Agnolo or Aniello—_e. g._, the wonderful fisherman,\r\nMasaniello, was, in fact, Tomasso Angelo; by the Venetian into Anziolo,\r\nAnzioleto, Anzioleta; and by the Florentine, into Angiolo, Angioletto,\r\nand thence into the ever-renowned contraction Giotto, unless indeed this\r\nbe from Gotofredo. It passed to other nations, but was of more rare\r\noccurrence there, except in the feminine. The fashion of complimenting\r\nwomen as angels, left the masculine Ange to be scantily used in France,\r\nand Angel now and then in England; but in Italy alone did Angiolo, and\r\nits derivative Angelico, thrive. All the other countries adopted the\r\nfeminine, either in the simple form or the diminutive, or most commonly,\r\nthe derivative, Angelica (angelical), noted in romance as the faithless\r\nlady, for whose sake Orlando lost his heart, and his senses. She was a\r\ngratuitous invention of Boiardo and Ariosto; whose character for\r\nsurpassing beauty made her name popular, and thus Angelica and Angelique\r\nhave always been favourites.\r\n\r\n           ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n           │   English.    │    German.    │    French.    │\r\n           │Angela         │Engel          │Angele         │\r\n           │Angelot        │Engelchen      │Angeline       │\r\n           │Angelina       │Angelina       │Angelique      │\r\n           │Angelica       │Angelica       │               │\r\n           ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n           │   Italian.    │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │\r\n           │Angiola        │Ancela         │Anjela         │\r\n           │Angioletta     │               │Anjelina       │\r\n           │Angelica       │               │Anjelika       │\r\n           │Agnola         │               │               │\r\n           │Anzioleta      │               │               │\r\n           └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nAngel was most often a man’s name in England. We find it at Hadleigh,\r\nSuffolk, in 1591, and sometimes likewise in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nArchangel has even been used as an English name.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious creatures that are first mentioned as “keeping the way of\r\nthe tree of life,” then were represented in the tabernacle overshadowing\r\nthe ark, and afterwards were revealed in vision to the Prophet Ezekiel\r\nand to the Apostle St. John, combined in their forms the symbols of all\r\nthat was wisest, bravest, strongest, and loftiest in creation—the man,\r\nthe lion, the ox, and eagle.\r\n\r\nIn the lands where Art made the Cherub a mere head with wings, Cherubino\r\narose as a Christian name, for it is hardly ever to be met with out of\r\nSpain and Italy.\r\n\r\nEqually misused is Seraph—now a lady’s name, as Seraphine in France;\r\nSerafina, in Spain and Italy. The word seraph, or saraph, signifies\r\nburning, or fiery, and would apply to that intensity of glory that\r\nEzekiel struggles to express in the cherubim by comparisons to amber and\r\nto glowing embers, or to their intense fervour of love.\r\n\r\nThree individual angels have been revealed to us by name as of the seven\r\nthat stand in the presence of God, and foremost of these is Michael (who\r\nis like unto God), he who was made known to Daniel as the protector of\r\nthe Jewish people; to Zechariah, as defending them from Satan; to St.\r\nJude, as disputing with Satan for the body of Moses; and to St. John, as\r\nleading the hosts of Heaven to battle with the adversary and prevailing\r\nover him.\r\n\r\nHis name would have seemed in itself fit only for an archangel, yet\r\nbefore apparently he had been made known, it had been borne by the\r\nfather of one of David’s captains, and by a son of Jehoshaphat, and it\r\nwas almost the same as Micaiah, the name of him who foretold the\r\ndestruction of Ahab.\r\n\r\nConstantine the Great dedicated a church in his new city in honour of\r\nSt. Michael, the archangel, and thenceforth Mickaelion, or Mikael, have\r\nbeen favourites with all branches of the Eastern Church.\r\n\r\nAn appearance of the archangel in Colosse led the way to another legend\r\nof his descent upon Monte Galgano in Apulia, somewhere about 493. Then\r\ncame a more notable vision, seen by Gregory the Great himself, of the\r\nangel standing with outstretched sword on the tomb of Adrian, which has\r\never since been called the castle of St. Angelo. In 706, St. Michael was\r\nagain seen to take his stand upon the isolated rock on the Norman coast,\r\nso noted as the fortress and convent of Mont St. Michel. Moreover\r\ntradition placed him upon the Cornish rock,—\r\n\r\n              “When the great vision of the guarded mount\r\n              Looked towards Namancos and Bayona’s hold.”\r\n\r\nHe was above all others the patron of the Christian warrior; his\r\narmour-clad effigy was seen in almost every church; the young knight was\r\ndubbed in his name, as well as that of the national saint; and since the\r\nprevalence of saintly names, his name has been frequently bestowed. It\r\nis, perhaps, most common in the Greek and Slavonic countries; but\r\nIreland makes great use of it; and Italy has united it with the epithet\r\nangel, in the one distinguished instance of Michelangelo Buonarotti.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Michael        │Michel         │Miguel         │Michele        │\r\n   │Mick           │Michon         │               │               │\r\n   │Mike           │Michau         │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Dutch.     │   Swedish.    │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Michael        │Michiel        │Mikael         │Michail        │\r\n   │Micha          │Micheltje      │Mikel          │Michaila       │\r\n   │Micha          │               │Mikas          │Misha          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Mischenka      │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Slavonic.   │   Servian.    │     Lett.     │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Miha           │Miljo          │Mikkelis       │Mihaly         │\r\n   │Mihal          │Miho           │               │Mihal          │\r\n   │Mihaljo        │Misa           │               │Miska          │\r\n   │               │Mijailo        │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThere is some confusion in the German mind between it and the old\r\n_michel_ (mickle, large), which, as a name, it has quite absorbed.

Kuru is a name said to be older than\r\nthe Sanscrit and of unknown signification; although some derive it from\r\nKhur, one name for the sun. Kureish was the original form; Koreish to\r\nthe Hebrews; Kyros to the Greeks, whence the Romans took the Cyrus by\r\nwhich he is known to Europe. His only namesake in his own line was he\r\nwho invited the 10,000 from Greece and perished at Cunaxa, and of whom\r\nis told the story of his willing acceptance of the water of the river\r\nKur or Cyrus, whose name sounded like his own. When the Sassanids\r\nrevived the old Achæmenid names they pronounced the royal word as\r\nKhoosroo, and the Byzantines recorded it as Chosröes, when Chosröes\r\nNushirvan, or the magnanimous, almost rivalled the glory of his\r\nancestor—Kai Khoosroo, as the _Shahnameh_ called him.\r\n\r\nNot only had the fire-worshippers revived the name, but it had been\r\nborne by various Christians in the East, one of whom, a physician of\r\nAlexandria, suffered in one of the persecutions, having been detected in\r\nvisiting a Christian prisoner. He was buried at Canope, in Egypt, and\r\nwas called in the Coptic calendar Abba Cher, or Father Cyrus; in the\r\nGreek, Abba Cyrus. His relics were afterwards transported to Rome, where\r\nthe Church built over them was called, by the Italians, Saint Appassara.\r\nLike a fixed star, the original Cyrus had shone through adjacent\r\ndarkness, evident by his lustre, but his lineaments lost in distance,\r\nand thus Ferdosi makes him a mere mythical hero. Herodotus copied some\r\ndistorted tradition; Xenophon pourtrayed imaginary perfection in his\r\n_Cyropædia_; and moderns have taken even greater liberties with him.\r\n_Artaban, ou le grand Cyrus_, the ponderous romance of Mlle. de Scudery,\r\nwas a stately French tale of love and war, containing a long amorous\r\ncorrespondence between Cyrus and his beloved, the model and admiration\r\nof the _précieuses_ in their glory, and absolutely not without effect\r\nupon nomenclature. In one village in Picardy there still exist living\r\nspecimens of Oriane, Philoxène, Célamire, Arsinoe, Calvandre, all\r\nderived from vassals named by their enthusiastic seigneurs in honour of\r\nthe heroines of the fashionable romances, and still inherited by their\r\nposterity long after the seigneurs and the heroines are alike forgotten.\r\n\r\nEither from his being mentioned in the Bible, or from the _Cyropædia_,\r\nCyrus has had some currency as an English baptismal name.[23]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Esther._\r\n\r\nKhshayarsha, from _Kshaya_ (a king), and _arsha_ (venerable), was the\r\nword that was converted in Hebrew into Achashverosh, and in our Bible\r\ninto Ahasuerus, while the Greeks called it Xerxes. In Illyria people are\r\nchristened from him Kserksas, and called Sersa, and a few seekers of\r\nScripture names, chiefly in America, have called their sons Ahasuerus,\r\nin common life Hazzy.\r\n\r\nThe reigning wife of Xerxes is known to have been Amestris, the daughter\r\nof an Achæmenian noble, and she might well have been Vashti, set aside\r\nonly for a time when the address of the nobles gained a victory over\r\nher. The fair daughter of the tribe of Benjamin, whose royalty ensured\r\nher people’s safety, was in her own tongue Hadassah, or the Myrtle; some\r\nsay, Atossa; but the Persian epithet by which we know her may have been\r\ntaken from _satarah_, a word showing the ancient union of the languages,\r\nsince Aster is Arab and Greek; and from thence and the Latin _stella_\r\nhave sprung the modern _étoile_, _estrella_, star, _stern_, _stjorna_,\r\nwhich the Septuagint gave as Ἑστὴρ, the Romans as Esthera and Hestera;\r\nwhence the occasional variations in English of Esther or Essie, and\r\nHester or Hetty.\r\n\r\nNot till the days of Racine was Esther much in vogue. The tragedian,\r\nbeing requested to write a sacred drama to be acted by the young ladies\r\nof St. Cyr, chose this subject in compliment to Madame de Maintenon, as\r\nthe faultless Esther preferred before the discarded Vashti, namely,\r\nMadame de Montespan! Esther thereupon became a favourite lady’s name in\r\nFrance, and vied in popularity with the cumbrous splendours taken from\r\nthe Scudery cycle of romance. At the same time it was borne by the two\r\nladies who had the misfortune to be the object of Dean Swift’s\r\naffection, Esther Johnson and Esther Vanhomrigh, whom he called, one by\r\nthe Latin name Stella; the other, by the generic title of our finest\r\nEnglish butterflies, Vanessa. Estrella was the heroine of a Spanish\r\npastoral, whence the Abbé Florian borrowed his theatrical shepherdess\r\nEstelle, which thus became a French name, though chiefly on the stage,\r\nand both Estelle and Stella are sometimes used as Epiphany names for\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nRoschana, as it is now pronounced, is still common in Persia, and means\r\nthe dawn of day. Roxane and Statire, as rival heroines of Racine, became\r\nproverbs in France for the stately or the languishing form of tragedy\r\ndame. Roxana, or Roxy, is one of the favourite American grandiloquent\r\nstyle of names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                         NAMES PROM THE GREEK.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing from Persian to Greek names, we feel at once that we are nearer\r\nhome, and that we claim a nearer kindred in thoughts and habits, if not\r\nin blood, with the sons of Javan, than with the fire-worshippers. The\r\nnational names are thus almost always explicable by the language itself,\r\nwith a few exceptions, either when the name was an importation from\r\nEgypt or Phœnicia, whence many of the earlier arts had been brought.\r\n\r\nEach Greek had but one name, which was given to him by his father either\r\non or before the tenth day of his life, when a sacrifice and banquet was\r\nheld. Genealogies were exceedingly interesting to the Greeks, as the\r\nmutual connection of city with city, race with race, was thus kept up,\r\nand community of ancestry was regarded as a bond of alliance, attaching\r\nthe Athenians, for instance, to the Asiatic Ionians as both sons of Ion,\r\nor the Spartans to the Syracusans, as likewise descended from Doros.\r\nEach individual state had its deified ancestor, and each family of note\r\na hero parent, to whom worship was offered at every feast, and who was\r\nsupposed still to exert active protection over his votaries. The\r\npolitical rights of the citizens, and the place they occupied in the\r\narmy, depended on their power of tracing their line from the forefather\r\nof a recognized tribe, after whose name the whole were termed with the\r\npatronymic termination _ides_ (the son of). This was only, however, a\r\ndistinction, for surnames were unknown, and each man possessed merely\r\nthe individual personal appellation by which he was always called,\r\nwithout any title, be his station what it might. Families used, however,\r\nto mark themselves by recurring constantly to the same name. It was the\r\ncorrect thing to give the eldest son that of his paternal grandfather,\r\nas Kimon, Miltiades, then Kimon again, if the old man were dead, for if\r\nhe were living it would have been putting another in his place, a bad\r\nomen, and therefore a father’s name was hardly ever given to a son.\r\nSometimes, however, the prefix was preserved, and the termination\r\nvaried, so as to mark the family without destroying the individual\r\nidentity. Thus, Leonidas, the third son of Anaxandridas, repeated with\r\nan augmentative his grandfather’s name of Leo (a lion), as his father,\r\nAnaxandridas, did that of _his_ own great grandfather, Anaxandras (king\r\nof man), whose son Eurycratidas was named from his grandfather\r\nEurycrates. A like custom prevailed among the old English.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans had subdued Greece and extended the powers of becoming\r\ncitizens, the name of the adopting patron would be taken by his client,\r\nand thus Latin and Greek titles became mixed together. Later, Greek\r\nsecond names became coined, either from patronymics, places, or events,\r\nand finally ran into the ordinary European system of surnames.\r\n\r\nAmong the names here ensuing will only be found those that concern the\r\nhistory of Christian names. Many a great heart-thrilling sound connected\r\nwith the brightest lights of the ancient world must be passed by,\r\nbecause it has not pleased the capricious will of after-generations to\r\nperpetuate it, or so exceptionally as not to be worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nSome of the female Greek names were appropriate words and epithets; but\r\nothers, perhaps the greater number, were merely men’s names with the\r\nfeminine termination in _a_ or _e_, often irrespective of their meaning.\r\nSome of these have entirely perished from the lips of men, others have\r\nbeen revived by some enterprising writer in search of a fresh title for\r\na heroine. Such is Corinna (probably from Persephone’s title Κόρη\r\n(Koré), a maiden), the Bœotian poetess, who won a wreath of victory at\r\nThebes, and was therefore the example from whom Mdme. de Staël named her\r\nbrilliant Corinne, followed in her turn by numerous French damsels; and\r\nin an Italian chronicle of the early middle ages, the lady whom we have\r\nbeen used to call Rowena, daughter of Henghist, has turned into Corinna;\r\nwhilst Cora, probably through Lord Byron’s poem, is a favourite in\r\nAmerica. Such too is Aspasia (welcome), from the literary fame of its\r\nfirst owner chosen by the taste of the seventeenth century as the title\r\nunder which to praise the virtues of Lady Elizabeth Hastings. In the\r\n_Rambler_ and _Spectator_ days, real or fictitious characters were\r\nusually introduced under some classical or pastoral appellation, and\r\nladies corresponded with each other under the soubriquets of nymph,\r\ngoddess, or heroine, and in virtue of its sound Aspasia was adopted\r\namong these. It has even been heard as a Christian name in a cottage.\r\n“Her name’s Aspasia, but us calls her Spash.”[24]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Rawlinson, _Herodotus_; Malcolm, _Persia_; Le Beau, _Bas Empire_;\r\n  Rollin, _Ancient History_; Butler, _Lives of the Saints_; Dunlop,\r\n  _History of Fiction_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Bishop Thirlwall, _Greece_; Smith, _Dictionary of Greek and Roman\r\n  Antiquities_; Lappenberg, _Anglo-Saxons_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                      NAMES FROM GREEK MYTHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I.\r\n\r\nGreek appellations may be divided into various classes; the first, those\r\nof the gods and early heroes are derived from languages inexplicable\r\neven by the classical Greeks. These were seldom or never given to human\r\nbeings, though derivatives from them often were.\r\n\r\nThe second class is of those formed from epithets in the spoken\r\nlanguage. These belonged to the Greeks of the historical age, and such\r\nas were borne by the Macedonian conquerors became spread throughout the\r\nEast, thus sometimes falling to the lot of early saints of the Church,\r\nand becoming universally popular in Christendom. Of others of merely\r\nclassic association a few survived among the native Greeks, while others\r\nwere resuscitated at intervals; first, by the vanity of decaying Rome;\r\nnext, by the revival of ancient literature in the Cinque-cento; then, by\r\nthe magniloquent taste of the Scudery romances in France; again, in\r\nFrance, by the republican mania; and, in the present time, by the same\r\ntaste in America, and by the reminiscences of the modern Greeks.\r\n\r\nAfter the preaching of the Gospel, Greece had vigour enough to compose\r\nappropriate baptismal names for the converts; and it is curious to\r\nobserve that no other country could have ever been so free from the\r\ntrammels of hereditary nomenclature, for no other has so complete a set\r\nof names directly bearing upon Christianity. So graceful are they in\r\nsound as well as meaning, and so honoured for those who bore them, that\r\nmany have spread throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nLastly, even modern Greek has thrown out many names of graceful sound,\r\nwhich are, however, chiefly confined to the Romaic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION II.—_Names from Zeus._\r\n\r\nAt the head of the whole Greek system stands the mighty Zeus (Ζεύς), a\r\nword that has been erected into a proper name for the thundering father\r\nof gods and men, whilst the cognate θεὸς (theos) passed into a generic\r\nterm; just as at Rome the Deus Pater (God-Father), or Jupiter, from the\r\nsame source, became the single god, and _deus_ the general designation.\r\n\r\nAll come from the same source as the Sanscrit Deva, and are connected\r\nwith the open sky, and the idea of light that has produced our word day.\r\nWe shall come upon them again and again; but for the present we will\r\nconfine ourselves to the personal names produced by Zeus, in his\r\nindividual character, leaving those from Theos to the Christian era, to\r\nwhich most of them belong.\r\n\r\nTheir regular declension of Zeus made _Dios_ the genitive case; and thus\r\nDiodorus, Diogenes, &c., ought, perhaps, to be referred to him; but the\r\nmore poetical, and, therefore, most probably the older, form, was\r\n_Zenos_ in the genitive; and as Dios also meant heaven, the above names\r\nseem to be better explained as heaven-gift and heaven-born, leaving to\r\nZeus only those that retain the same commencement.\r\n\r\nΖηνὼν, or, as it is commonly called, Zeno, was a good deal used in\r\nGreece throughout the classical times, and descending to Christian\r\ntimes, named a saint martyred under Gallienus, also a bishop of Verona,\r\nwho left ninety-three sermons, at the beginning of the fourth century,\r\nand thus made it a canonical name, although the rules of the Church had\r\nforbidden christening children after heathen gods. Except for the\r\nIsaurian Emperor Zeno, and an occasional Russian Sinon, there has not,\r\nhowever, been much disposition to use the name.\r\n\r\nZenobios, life from Zeus, is by far the easiest way of explaining the\r\nname of the brilliant Queen of Palmyra; but, on the other hand, she was\r\nof Arabian birth, the daughter of Amrou, King of Arabia, and it is\r\nhighly probable that she originally bore the true Arabic name of Zeenab\r\n(ornament of the father); and that when she and her husband entered on\r\nintercourse with the Romans, the name Zenobia was bestowed upon her as\r\nan equivalent, together with the genuine Latin Septima as a mark of\r\ncitizenship. When her glory waned, and she was brought as a prisoner to\r\nRome, she and her family were allowed to settle in Italy; and her\r\ndaughters left descendants there. Zenobius, the Bishop of Milan, who\r\nsucceeded St. Ambrose, bore her name, and claimed her blood; and thus\r\nZenobio and Zenobia still linger among the inhabitants of the city.\r\n\r\nThe romance of her story caught the French fancy, and Zénobie has been\r\nrather in fashion among modern French damsels.\r\n\r\nA Cilician brother and sister, called Zenobius and Zenobia, the former a\r\nphysician and afterwards Bishop of Ægæ, were put to death together\r\nduring the persecution of Diocletian, and thus became saints of the\r\nEastern Church, making Sinovij, Sinovija, or for short, Zizi, very\r\nfashionable among the Russians.\r\n\r\nIt is much more difficult to account for the prevalence of Zenobia in\r\nCornwall. Yet many parish registers show it as of an early date: and\r\ndear to the West is the story of a sturdy dame called Zenobia\r\nBrengwenna, (Mrs. Piozzi makes the surname Stevens,) who, on her\r\nninety-ninth birthday, rode seventeen miles on a young colt to restore\r\nto the landlord a 99 years' lease that had been granted to her father,\r\nin her name, at her birth.\r\n\r\nProbably Zenaïda means daughter of Zeus. Although not belonging to any\r\npatron saint, it is extensively popular among Russian ladies; and either\r\nfrom them, or from the modern Greek, the French have recently become\r\nfond of Zenaïde.[25]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Smith, _Dictionary_; Butler, _Lives_; Gibbon, _Rome_; Miss Beaufort,\r\n  _Egyptian Sepulchres and Syrian Shrines_; Hayward, _Mrs. Piozzi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION III.—Ἡρα—Hera.\r\n\r\nThe name of the white-armed, ox-eyed queen of heaven, Ἡρα or Ἡρη (Hera\r\nor Heré), is derived by philologists from the same root as the familiar\r\nGerman _herr_ and _herrinn_, and thus signifies the lady or mistress.\r\nIndeed the masculine form ἥρως, whence we take our hero, originally\r\nmeant a free or noble man, just as _herr_ does in ancient German, and\r\ncame gradually to mean a person distinguished on any account,\r\nprincipally in arms; and thence it became technically applied to the\r\nnoble ancestors who occupied an intermediate place between the gods and\r\nexisting men. The Latin _herus_ and _hera_ are cognate, and never rose\r\nout of their plain original sense of master and mistress, though the\r\n_heros_ was imported in his grander sense from the Greek, and has passed\r\non to us.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that whereas the wife of Zeus was simply the lady, it was\r\nexactly the same with Frigga, who, as we shall by-and-by see, was merely\r\nthe Frau—the free woman or lady.\r\n\r\nHera herself does not seem to have had many persons directly named after\r\nher, though there was plenty from the root of her name. The feminine\r\nHero was probably thus derived,—belonging first to one of the Danaïdes,\r\nthen to a daughter of Priam, then to the maiden whose light led Leander\r\nto his perilous breasting of the Hellespont, and from whom Shakespeare\r\nprobably took it for the lady apparently “done to death by slanderous\r\ntongues.”\r\n\r\nIt is usual to explain as Ἡρα-κλῆς (fame of Hera) the name of the son of\r\nZeus and Alcmena, whose bitterest foe Hera was, according to the current\r\nlegends of Greece; but noble fame is a far more probable origin for\r\nHerakles, compound as he is of the oft-repeated Sun-myth mixed with the\r\nveritable Samson, and the horrible Phœnician Melkarth or Moloch, with\r\nwhom the Tyrians themselves identified Herakles.\r\n\r\nA few compounds, such as Heraclius, Heraclidas, Heracleonas, have been\r\nformed from Herakles, the hero ancestor of the Spartan kings, and\r\ntherefore specially venerated in Lacedæmon. The Latins called the name\r\nHercules; and it was revived in the Cinque-cento, in Italy, as Ercole.\r\nThus Hercule was originally the baptismal name of Catherine de Medici’s\r\nyoungest son; but he changed it to François at his confirmation, when\r\nhoping to mount a throne. Exceptionally, Hercules occurs in England; and\r\nwe have known of more than one old villager called Arkles, respecting\r\nwhom there was always a doubt whether he were Hercules or Archelaus.\r\n\r\nHence, too, the name of the father of history, Herodotus (noble gift);\r\nhence, likewise, that of Herodes. Some derive this last from the Arab\r\n_hareth_ (a farmer); but it certainly was a Greek name long before the\r\nIdumean family raised themselves to the throne of Judea, since a poet\r\nwas so called who lived about the time of Cyrus. If the Herods were real\r\nEdomites, they may have Græcized Hareth into Herodes; but it is further\r\nalleged that the first Herod, grandfather of the first king, was a\r\nslave, attached to the temple of Apollo at Ascalon, taken captive by\r\nIdumean robbers. Hateful as is the name in its associations, its\r\nfeminine, Herodias, became doubly hateful as the murderess of John the\r\nBaptist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IV.—_Athene._\r\n\r\nThe noble goddess of wisdom, pure and thoughtful, armed against evil,\r\nand ever the protector of all that was thoughtfully brave and resolute,\r\nwas called Αθήνη (Athene), too anciently for the etymology to be\r\ndiscernible, or even whether her city of Athens was called from her, or\r\nshe from the city.\r\n\r\nMany an ancient Greek was called in honour of her, but the only one of\r\nthese names that has to any degree survived is Athenaïs.\r\n\r\nThere were some Cappadocian queens, so called; and so likewise was the\r\ndaughter of a heathen philosopher in the fourth century, whom the able\r\nPrincess Pulcheria selected as the wife of her brother Theodosius,\r\naltering her name, however, to Eudocia at her baptism.\r\n\r\nIt must have been the Scudery cycle of romance that occasioned Athenaïs\r\nto have been given to that Demoiselle de Mortémar, who was afterwards\r\nbetter known as Madame de Montespan.\r\n\r\nAthenaios (Athenian), Athenagoras (assembly of Athene), Athenadgoros\r\n(gift of Athene), were all common among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nAthene’s surname of Pallas is derived by Plato from πάλλειν, to\r\nbrandish, because of her brandished spear; but it is more likely to be\r\nfrom πάλλαξ (a virgin), which would answer to her other surname of\r\nπαρθένος, likewise a virgin, familiar to us for the sake of the most\r\nbeautiful of all heathen remains, the Parthenon, as well as the ancient\r\nname of Naples, Parthenope. This, however, was a female name in Greece,\r\nand numerous instances of persons called Parthenios and Palladios attest\r\nthe general devotion to this goddess, perhaps the grandest of all the\r\nimaginings of the Indo-European.\r\n\r\nThere is something absolutely satisfactory in seeing how much more the\r\nloftier and purer deities, Athene, Apollo, Artemis, reigned over Greek\r\nnomenclature than the embodiments of brute force and sensual pleasure,\r\nAres and Aphrodite, both probably introductions from the passionate\r\nAsiatics, and as we see in Homer, entirely on the Trojan side. An\r\noccasional Aretas and Arete are the chief recorded namesakes of Ares,\r\npresiding god of the Areopagus as he was; and thence may have come the\r\nItalian Aretino, and an Areta, who appears in Cornwall. Aphrodite seems\r\nto have hardly one derived from her name, which is explained as the Foam\r\nSprung.[26]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Smith, _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Mythology_; Le Beau, _Bas\r\n  Empire_; Gladstone, _Homer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION V.—_Apollo and Artemis._\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister deities, twin children of Zeus and Leto, are,\r\nwith the exception of Athene, the purest and brightest creations of\r\nGreek mythology.\r\n\r\nThe sister’s name, Artemis, certainly meant the sound, whole, or\r\nvigorous; that of the brother, Apollōn, is not so certainly explained;\r\nthough Æschylus considered it to come from ἀπόλλυμι, to destroy.\r\n\r\nThey both of them had many votaries in Greece; such names as Apollodorus\r\n(gift of Apollo), Apollonius, and the like, arising in plenty, but none\r\nof them have continued into Christian times, though Apollos was a\r\ncompanion of St. Paul. The sole exception is Apollonia, an Alexandrian\r\nmaiden, whose martyrdom began by the extraction of all her teeth, thus\r\nestablishing St. Apolline, as the French call her, as the favourite\r\nsubject of invocation in the toothache. Abellona, the Danish form of\r\nthis name, is a great favourite in Jutland and the isles, probably from\r\nsome relic of the toothless maiden. The Slovaks use it as Polonija or\r\nPolona.\r\n\r\nThe votaries of Artemis did not leave a saint to perpetuate them; but\r\nArtemisia, the brave queen of Halicarnassus, had a name of sufficient\r\nstateliness to delight the _précieuses_. Thus Artémise was almost as\r\nuseful in French romances as the still more magnificent Artémidore, the\r\nFrench version of Artemidorus (gift of Artemis).\r\n\r\nIt was a late fancy of mythology, when all was becoming confused, that\r\nmade Apollo and Artemis into the sun and moon deities, partly in\r\nconsequence of their epithets Phœbus, Phœbe, from φάω (to shine). The\r\noriginal Phœbe seems to have belonged to some elder myth, for she is\r\nsaid to have been daughter of Heaven and Earth, and to have been the\r\noriginal owner of the Delphic oracle. Afterwards she was said to have\r\nbeen the mother of Leto (the obscure), and thus grandmother of Apollo\r\nand Artemis, who thence took their epithet. This was probably a myth of\r\nthe alternation of light and darkness; but as we have received our\r\nnotions of Greek mythology through the dull Roman medium, it is almost\r\nimpossible to disentangle our idea of Phœbus from the sun, or of Phœbe\r\nfrom the crescent moon. In like manner the exclusively modern Greek\r\nφωτεινή (bright), Photinee, comes from φώς phos (light), as does\r\nPhotius, used in Russia as Fotie.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, we find Phœbus among the mediæval Counts of Foix, who,\r\non the French side of their little Pyrenean county were Gaston Phœbus;\r\non the Spanish, Gastone Febo. Some say that Phœbus was originally a\r\nsoubriquet applied to one of the family on account of his personal\r\nbeauty, though it certainly was afterwards given at baptism; others,\r\nthat it was an imitation of an old Basque name.\r\n\r\nPhœbe was a good deal in use among the women of Greek birth in the early\r\nRoman empire; and “Phœbe, our sister,” the deaconess of Cenchrea, is\r\ncommended by St. Paul to the Romans; but she has had few namesakes,\r\nexcept in England; the Italian Febe only being used as a synonym for the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nCynthia was a title belonging to Artemis, from Mount Cynthus, and has\r\nthence become a title of the moon, and a name of girls in America.\r\n\r\nDelia, another title coming from Delos, the place of her nativity, has\r\nbeen preferred by the Arcadian taste, and flourished in shepherdess\r\npoems, so as to be occasionally used as a name in England, but more\r\noften as a contraction for Cordelia.\r\n\r\nDelphinios and Delphinia were both of them epithets of Apollo and\r\nArtemis, of course from the shrine at Delphi. Some say that shrine and\r\ngod were so called because the serpent Python was named Delphinè;\r\nothers, that the epithet was derived from his having metamorphosed\r\nhimself into a dolphin, or else ridden upon one, when showing the Cretan\r\ncolonists the way to Delphi.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of _Delphys adelphus_ is the womb; and thus the Greeks\r\nbelieved Delphi to be the centre of the earth, just as the mediæval\r\nChristians thought Jerusalem was. It is from this word that delphis (a\r\nbrother) is derived, and from one no doubt of the same root, that was\r\nfirst a mass, and afterwards a dolphin, the similarity of sound\r\naccounting for the confusion of derivatives from the temple and the\r\nfish. Again, the dolphin is said to be so called as being the fish of\r\nthe Dolphièm god.\r\n\r\nIt was probably as an attribute of the god that Delphinos was used as a\r\nname by the Greeks; and it makes its first appearance in Christian times\r\nin two regions under Greek influence, namely, Venice and Southern\r\nFrance, which latter place was much beholden for civilization to the\r\nGreek colony of Massilia. Dolfino has always prevailed in the Republic\r\nof St. Mark; and Delphinus was a sainted bishop of Bourdeaux, in the\r\nfourth century, from whom many, both male and female, took the name,\r\nwhich to them was connected with the fish of Jonah, the emblem of the\r\nResurrection.\r\n\r\nIn 1125, Delfine, heiress of Albon, married Guiges, Count of Viennois.\r\nShe was his third wife; and to distinguish her son from the rest of the\r\nfamily, he was either called or christened, Guiges Delphin, and assumed\r\nthe dolphin as his badge, whence badge and title passed to his\r\ndescendants, the Counts Dauphins de Viennois. The last of these left his\r\ncountry and title to Charles, son of King Jean of France; and thence the\r\nheir-apparent was called the Dauphin.\r\n\r\nDalphin appears at Cambrai before 1200; and Delphine de Glandèves,\r\nsharing the saintly honours of her husband, Count Elzéar de St. Sabran,\r\nbecame the patroness of the many young ladies in compliment to _la\r\ndauphine_.\r\n\r\nIt is startling to meet with ‘Dolphin’ as a daughter of the unfortunate\r\nWaltheof, Earl of Mercia; but unless her mother, Judith, imported the\r\nFrench Delphine, it is probable that it is a mistake for one of the many\r\nforms of the Frank, Adel, which was displacing its congener the native\r\nÆthel. Indeed, Dolfine, which is very common among German girls now, is\r\navowedly the contraction of Adolfine, their feminine for Adolf (noble\r\nwolf).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION VI.—_Hele._\r\n\r\nThe sun-god who drove his flaming chariot around the heavenly vault day\r\nby day, and whose eye beheld everything throughout the earth, was in\r\nHomer’s time an entirely different personage from the “far darting\r\nApollo,” with whom, thanks to the Romans, we confound him.\r\n\r\nHelios was his name, a word from the root _elé_ (light), the same that\r\nhas furnished the Teutonic adjective _hell_ (bright or clear), and that\r\nis met again in the Keltic _heol_ (the sun).\r\n\r\nThis root ele (heat or light) is found again in the Greek name of the\r\nmoon, Sēēlēnē once a separate goddess from Artemis. One of the\r\nCleopatras was called Selene; but it does not appear that this was used\r\nagain as a name till in the last century, when Selina was adopted in\r\nEngland, probably by mistake, for the French Céline, and belonged to the\r\nWesleyan Countess of Huntingdon.\r\n\r\nFrom ēlē again sprang the name most of all noted among Greeks, the fatal\r\nname of Ἑλένε, Helene, the feminine of Helenos (the light or bright),\r\nthough Æschylus, playing on the word, made it ἑλένας (the\r\nship-destroying).\r\n\r\n               “Wherefore else this fatal name,\r\n               That Helen and destruction are the same.”\r\n\r\nA woman may be a proverb for any amount of evil or misfortune, but as\r\nlong as she is also a proverb for beauty, her name will be copied, and\r\nHelena never died away in Greece, and latterly was copied by Roman\r\nladies when they first became capable of a little variety.\r\n\r\nAt last it was borne by the lady who was the wife of Constantius\r\nChlorus, the mother of Constantine, and the restorer of the shrines at\r\nJerusalem. St. Helena, holding the true cross, was thenceforth revered\r\nby East and West. Bithynia on the one hand, Britain on the other, laid\r\nclaim to have been her birth-place, and though it is unfortunately most\r\nlikely that the former country is right, and that she can hardly be the\r\ndaughter of “Old King Cole,” yet it is certain that the ancient Britons\r\nheld her in high honour. Eglwys Ilan, the Church of Helen, still exists\r\nin Wales, and the insular Kelts have always made great use of her name.\r\nEllin recurs in old Welsh pedigrees from the Empress’s time. Elayne is\r\nreally the old Cambrian form occurring in registers from early times,\r\nand thus explaining the gentle lady Elayne, the mother of Sir Galahad,\r\nwhom Tennyson has lately identified with his own spinning Lady of\r\nShalott. Helen, unfortunately generally pronounced Ellen, was used from\r\nthe first in Scotland; Eileen or Aileen in Ireland.\r\n\r\nNor are these Keltic Ellens the only offspring of the name. Elena in\r\nItaly, it assumed the form of Aliénor among the Romanesque populations\r\nof Provence, who, though speaking a Latin tongue, greatly altered and\r\ndisguised the words. Indeed there are some who derive this name from\r\nέλεος (pity), but there is much greater reason to suppose it another\r\nvariety of Helena, not more changed than many other Provençal names.\r\nAliénor in the land of troubadours received all the homage that the\r\nLanguedoc could pay, and one Aliénor at least was entirely spoilt by it,\r\nnamely, she who was called Eléonore by the French king who had the\r\nmisfortune to marry her, and who became in time on English lips our grim\r\nEleanor of the dagger and the bowl, the hateful Aquitainian grandmother,\r\nwho bandies words with Constance of Brittany in _King John_. Her\r\ndaughter, a person of far different nature, carried her name to\r\nCastille, where, the language being always disposed to cut off a\r\ncommencing _e_, she was known as Leonor, and left hosts of namesakes.\r\nHer descendant, the daughter of San Fernando, brought the name back to\r\nEngland, and, as our “good Queen Eleanor,” did much to redeem its\r\nhonour, which the levity of her mother-in-law, the Provençal Aliénor of\r\nHenry III., had greatly prejudiced. Eleanor continued to be a royal name\r\nas long as the Plantagenets were on the throne, and thus was widely used\r\namong the nobility, and afterwards by all ranks, when of course it lost\r\nits proper spelling and was turned into Ellinor and Elinor, still,\r\nhowever, owning its place in song and story. Annora, frequent in\r\nNorthern England, was the contraction of Eleanora, and was further\r\ncontracted into Annot. Also Ellen was Lina, or Linot.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    Greek.     │    Latin.     │   English.    │    Scotch.    │\r\n   │Ἑλένη          │Helena         │Helena         │Helen          │\r\n   │               │               │Helen          │Ellen          │\r\n   │               │               │Elaine         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Ellen          │               │\r\n   │Ἑλένἰσκη       │               │Eleanor        │               │\r\n   │               │               │Elinor         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Nelly          │               │\r\n   │Ἑλεναιαι       │               │Leonora        │               │\r\n   │               │               │Annora         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Annot          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Lina           │               │\r\n   │               │               │Linot          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Irish.     │    German.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Helena         │Helène         │Elena          │Helena         │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   │Eileen         │Eleonore       │Eleonora       │               │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   │Nelly          │Lenore         │Leonora        │Leon           │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Slavonic.   │   Servian.    │\r\n   │Jelena         │Helena         │Jelena         │Jelena         │\r\n   │               │Helenka        │Jela           │Jela           │\r\n   │               │               │Jelena         │Jelika         │\r\n   │               │               │Jela           │               │\r\n   │               │               │Jelika         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Lenka          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Lencica        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │     Ung.      │   Albanian.   │\r\n   │Lena           │Leno           │Ilona          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Ljena          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Lenia          │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nMeantime the Arragonese conquests in Italy had brought Leonora thither\r\nas a new name independent of Elena, and it took strong root there, still\r\npreserving its poetic fame in the person of the lovely Leonora d'Este,\r\nthe object of Tasso’s hopeless affection. To France again it came with\r\nthe Galigai, the Maréchale d'Ancre, the author of the famous saying\r\nabout the power of a strong mind over a weak one; and unpopular as she\r\nwas, Léonore has ever since been recognized in French nomenclature, and\r\nit went to Germany as Lenore.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church was constant to the memory of the Empress, mother of\r\nthe founder of Constantinople, and Helena has always been frequent\r\nthere. And when the royal widow Olga came from Muscovy to seek\r\ninstruction and baptism, she was called Helena, which has thus become\r\none of the popular Russian names. It is sometimes supposed to be a\r\ntranslation of Olga, but this is a mistake founded on the fact that this\r\nlady, and another royal saint, were called by both names. Olga is, in\r\nfact, the feminine of Oleg (the Russian form of Helgi), which the race\r\nof Rurik had derived from their Norse ancestor, and it thus means holy.\r\n\r\nSweden also has a Saint Helene, who made a pilgrimage to Rome, and was\r\nput to death on her return by her cruel relations in 1160. Her relics\r\nwere preserved in Zealand, near Copenhagen, making Ellin a favourite\r\nname among Danish damsels.\r\n\r\nHelena has a perplexing double pronunciation in English, the central\r\nsyllable being made long or short according to the tradition of the\r\nfamilies where it is used. The Greek letter was certainly the short _e_,\r\nbut it is believed that though the quantity of the syllable was short,\r\nthe accent was upon it, and that the traditional sound of it survives in\r\nthe name of the island which we learnt from the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VII.—_Demeter._\r\n\r\nAmong the elder deities in whom the primitive notion of homage to the\r\nGiver of all Good was lost and dispersed, was the beneficent mother\r\nDemeter (Δημητήρ). Some derive the first syllable of this name from γῆ\r\n(the earth), others from the Cretan δήαι (barley), making it either\r\nearth mother, or barley mother; but the idea of motherhood is always an\r\nessential part of this bounteous goddess, the materializing of the\r\nproductive power of the earth, “filling our hearts with food and\r\ngladness.”\r\n\r\nFormerly Demeter had numerous votaries, especially among the\r\nMacedonians, who were the greatest name-spreaders among the Greeks, and\r\nused it in all the “four horns” of their divided empire. It occurs in\r\nthe Acts, as the silversmith of Ephesus, who stirred up the tumult\r\nagainst St. Paul, and another Demetrius is commended by St. John. The\r\nLatin Church has no saint so called; but the Greek had a Cretan monk of\r\nthe fourteenth century, who was a great ecclesiastical author; and a\r\nDemetrios, who is reckoned as the second great saint of Thessalonika.\r\nHence Demetrios is one of the most popular of names in all the Eastern\r\nChurch, and the countries that have ever been influenced by it; among\r\nwhom must be reckoned the Venetian dominions which considered themselves\r\nto belong to the old Byzantine empire till they were able to stand\r\nalone. Dimitri has always been a great name in Russia. The Slavonian\r\nnations give it the contraction Mitar, and the feminine Dimitra or\r\nMitra. The modern Greek contraction is Demos.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Greece, Demeter was worshipped primarily as the gloomy\r\nwinterly earth, latterly as the humanized goddess clad in black, in\r\nmourning for her daughter, whence she was adored as Melaina. Whether\r\nfrom this title of the goddess or simply a dark complexion, there arose\r\nthe female name of Melania, which belonged to two Roman ladies,\r\ngrandmother and granddaughter, who were among the many who were devoted\r\nto the monastic Saint Jerome, and derived an odour of sanctity from his\r\nrecord of their piety. Though not placed in the Roman calendar, they are\r\nconsidered as saints, and the French Mélanie and the old Cornish Melony\r\nare derived from them.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, her summer epithet was Chloe, the verdant, as\r\nprotectress of green fields, and Chloe seems to have been used by the\r\nGreeks, as a Corinthian woman so called is mentioned by St. Paul, and\r\nhas furnished a few scriptural Chloes in England. In general, however,\r\nChloe has been a property of pastoral poetry, and has thence descended\r\nto negroes and spaniels.[27]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Smith, _Dictionary_; Keightley’s _Mythology_; Montalembert, _Monks of\r\n  the West_; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VIII.—_Dionysos._\r\n\r\nThe god of wine and revelry appears to have been adopted into Greek\r\nworship at a later period than the higher divinities embodying loftier\r\nideas. So wild and discordant are the legends respecting him, that it is\r\nprobable that in the Bacchus, or Dionysos, whom the historical Greeks\r\nadored, several myths are united; the leading ones being, on the one\r\nhand, the naturalistic deity of the vine; on the other, some dimly\r\nremembered conqueror.\r\n\r\nDionysos has never been satisfactorily explained, though the most\r\nobvious conclusion is that it means the god of Nysa—a mountain where he\r\nwas nursed by nymphs in a cave. Others make his mother Dione one of the\r\noriginal mythic ideas of a divine creature, the daughter of Heaven and\r\nEarth, and afterwards supposed to be the mother of Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nNames given in honour of Dionysos were very common in Greece, and\r\nespecially in the colony of Sicily, where Dion was also in use.\r\nDionysios, the tyrant, seemed only to make the name more universally\r\nknown, and most of the tales of tyranny clustered round him—such as the\r\nstory of his ear, of the sword of Damocles, and the devotion of Damon\r\nand Pythias.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Apostles, Dionysius was very frequent, and gave the\r\nname of the Areopagite mentioned by St. Paul, of several more early\r\nsaints, and of a bishop who, in 272, was sent to convert the Gauls, and\r\nwas martyred near Paris. The Abbey erected on the spot where he died was\r\nplaced under the special protection of the Counts of Paris; and when\r\nthey dethroned the sons of Charlemagne and became kings of France, St.\r\nDenys, as they called their saint, became the patron of the country; the\r\nbanner of the convent, the Oriflamme, was unfurled in their national\r\nwars, and _Mont joie St. Denys_ was their war-cry. St. Denys of France\r\nwas invoked, together with St. Michael, in knighting their young men;\r\nand St. Denys of France was received as one of the Seven Champions of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nThe Sicilians, having a certain confusion in their minds between the\r\nchampion and the tyrant of Syracuse, have taken San Dionigi for their\r\npatron; he is also in high favour in Portugal as Diniz, and in Spain as\r\nDionis. Denis is a very frequent Irish name, as a substitute for Donogh;\r\nand, to judge by the number of the surnames, Dennis, Denison, and\r\nTennyson or Tenison, it would seem to have been more common in England\r\nthan at present. The Russians have Dionissij; the Bohemians, Diwis; the\r\nSlavonians, Tennis; the Hungarians, Dienes. The feminine is the French\r\nDenise; English, Dionisia, Donnet, Dennet or Diot, which seem to have\r\nbeen at one time very common in England.[28]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott, Keightley, Michaelis, Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IX.—_Hermes._\r\n\r\nThe origin is lost of the name of Hermes, the swift, eloquent, and\r\ncunning messenger of Zeus; but it is supposed to come from hĕra (the\r\nearth), and was called Hermas, Hermes, or Hermeias.\r\n\r\nA long catalogue of Greeks might be given bearing names derived from\r\nhim; and it was correctly that Shakespeare called his Athenian maiden\r\nHermia.\r\n\r\nHermas is mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans, and is thought to be\r\nthe same with the very early Christian author of the allegory of _The\r\nShepherd_, but his name has not been followed.\r\n\r\nHermione was, in ancient legend, the wife of Cadmus, the founder of\r\nThebes, and shared his metamorphosis into a serpent. Afterwards, another\r\nHermione was the daughter of Helen and Menelaus, and, at first, wife of\r\nNeoptolemus, though afterwards of Orestes, the heroine of a tragedy of\r\nEuripides, where she appears in the unpleasant light of the jealous\r\npersecutor of the enslaved Andromache.\r\n\r\nHermione is generally supposed to be the same as the Italian Erminia and\r\nthe French Hermine; but these are both remains of the Herminian gens,\r\nand are therefore Latin.\r\n\r\nHermocrates, Hermagoras, Hermogenes, every compound of this god’s name\r\nprevailed in Greece; but the only one that has passed on to Christianity\r\nis Hermolaos (people of Hermes), a name that gave a saint to the Greek\r\nChurch, and is perpetuated in Russia as Ermolaï.[29]\r\n\r\nDescending from the greater deities of Olympus, we must touch upon the\r\nMuses, though not many instances occur of the use of their names. Μοῦσαι\r\n(Mousai), their collective title, is supposed to come from μάω (mao), to\r\ninvent; it furnished the term mousikos, for songs and poetry, whence the\r\nLatin _musa_, _musicus_, and all the forms in modern language in which\r\nwe speak of music and its professors.\r\n\r\nMusidora (gift of the Muses) was one of the fashionable poetical\r\nsoubriquets of the last century, and as such figures in Thomson’s\r\n_Seasons_.\r\n\r\nAs to the individual names, they have scarcely any owners except\r\nPolymnia, she of many hymns, whose modern representative, Polyhymnia,\r\nlies buried in a churchyard on Dartmoor, and startles us by her\r\nheadstone. The West Indian negresses, sporting the titles of the ships\r\nof war, however, come out occasionally as Miss Calliope, Miss Euterpe,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe only Muse who has left namesakes is hardly a fair specimen; for\r\nUrania (the heavenly), her epithet, as the presiding genius of\r\nastronomers, is itself formed from one of the pristine divinities of\r\nGreece, himself probably named from heaven itself, of which he was the\r\npersonification. Οὐρανός (Ouranos), Uranus, is in Greek both the sky and\r\nthe first father of all. The word is probably derived from the root\r\n_or_, which we find in ὄρος (a mountain), and ὄρνυμι (to raise), just as\r\nour heaven comes from to heave.\r\n\r\nUranius was not uncommon among the later Greeks, especially in Christian\r\nnames; a Gaulish author was so called, and it was left by the Romans as\r\na legacy to the British. It makes its appearance among the Welsh as\r\nUrien, a somewhat common name at one time. “Brave Urien sleeps upon his\r\ncraggy bed;” but Camden, or some one else before him, thought proper to\r\nidentify it with George, which has led to its decay and oblivion.\r\n\r\nUrania was revived in the days of euphuistic taste, when Sir Philip\r\nSidney called himself Sidrophel, and the object of his admiration,\r\nUrania; it became a favourite poetic title both in England and France,\r\nand in process of time, a family name.\r\n\r\nΘάλεια (Thaleia), though both Muse of Comedy, and one of the Three\r\nGraces, and signifying bloom, has not obtained any namesakes, though\r\nboth her sister Graces have.\r\n\r\nThese nymphs were the multiplied personifications of Χάρις (Charis)\r\ngrace, beauty, or charity. The Greeks were not unanimous as to the names\r\nor numbers of the Charites; the Athenians and Spartans adored only two,\r\nand the three usually recognized were defined by Hesiod. Thalia (bloom),\r\nAglaia (brightness), Euphrosyne (mirth, cheerfulness, or festivity).\r\n\r\nIt has been almost exclusively by Greeks that the name has been borne;\r\nit was a great favourite among the Romaic Greeks, figuring again and\r\nagain amongst the Porphyrogenitai, and to this present day it is common\r\namong the damsels of the Ionian Isles. I have seen it marked on a\r\nschool-child’s sampler in its own Greek letters. In common life it is\r\ncalled Phroso. In Russia it is Jefronissa.\r\n\r\nThe other Grace, Aglaia, comes to light in Christian legend, as the name\r\nof a rich and abandoned lady at Rome, who, hearing of the value that was\r\nset on the relics of saints, fancied them as a kind of roc’s egg to\r\ncomplete the curiosities of her establishment, and sent Boniface, both\r\nher steward and her lover, to the East to procure some for her. He asked\r\nin jest whether, if his bones came home to her, she would accept them as\r\nrelics; and she replied in the same spirit, little dreaming that at\r\nTarsus he would indeed become a Christian and a martyr, and his bones be\r\ntruly sent back to Rome, where Aglaia received them, became a penitent,\r\ntook the veil, and earned the saintly honours that have ever since been\r\npaid to her. It is unfortunate for the credibility of this story that\r\nthe date assigned to it is between 209 and 305, a wide space indeed, but\r\none in which relic worship had not begun, and even if it had, the bones\r\nof martyrs must have been only too plentiful much nearer home. However,\r\nthe French have taken up the name of Aglaë, and make great use of it.\r\n\r\nA few ancient Greeks had names compounded of Charis, such as Charinus,\r\nand Charilaus, the nephew of Lycurgus; but it was reserved for\r\nChristianity to give the word its higher sense. Charis, through the\r\nLatin caritas, grew to be the Christian’s Charity, the highest of the\r\nthree Graces: Faith, Hope, Love, that had taken the place of Bloom,\r\nMirth, and Brightness. And thus it was that, after the Reformation,\r\nCharity, contracted into Cherry, became an English Christian name,\r\nperhaps in remembrance of the fair and goodly Charity of the House\r\nBeautiful, herself a reflex of the lovely and motherly Charissa, to whom\r\nUna conducted the Red Cross Knight. Chariton, Kharitoon, in Russian, is\r\na name in the Greek Church, from a confessor of Sirmium, who under\r\nAurelius was flogged with ox-hides and imprisoned, but was liberated on\r\nthe Emperor’s death, and made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is the place, among these minor mythological personages, to\r\nmention that Zephyr (the West wind) has absolutely a whole family of\r\nname-children in France, where Zephirine has been greatly the fashion of\r\nlate years.[30]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Keightley’s _Mythology_; Cave’s _Lives of the Fathers_; Smith,\r\n  _Dictionary_; Potter’s _Euripides_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Smith, _Dictionary_; Keightley, _Mythology_; Montalembert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION X.—_Heroic Names._\r\n\r\nNot very many of the heroic names—glorious in poetry—have passed on; but\r\nwe will select a few of those connected with the siege of Troy, and\r\nhanded on upon that account. Mostly they were not easy of comprehension\r\neven to the Greeks themselves, and were not much copied among them,\r\nperhaps from a sense of reverence. It was only in the times of decay,\r\nand when the recollection of the fitness of things was lost, that men\r\ntried to cover their own littleness with the high-sounding names of\r\ntheir ancestors. Moreover, by that time, Greek associations were at a\r\ndiscount. Rome professed to descend from Troy, not from Greece; and,\r\nafter her example, modern nations have tried to trace themselves back to\r\nthe Trojan fugitives—the Britons to Brut, the French to Francus, &c.—and\r\nthus Trojan names have been more in vogue than Greek. However, be it\r\nobserved that the Trojan names are Greek in origin. The Trojans were of\r\nPelasgic blood, as well as most of their opponents; but they were\r\nenervated by residence in Asia, while the superior race of Hellenes had\r\nrenovated their Greek relatives; making just the difference that the\r\nNorman Conquest did to the English Saxon in opposition to his Frisian\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nOne of these inexplicable names was borne by Ἀχιλλεύς (Achilleus), the\r\nprime glory of Homer and of the Trojan war. The late Greek traditions\r\nsaid that his first name had been Ligyron, or the whining, but that he\r\nwas afterwards called Achilles, from Α privative and χέιλη (cheile),\r\nlip; because he was fed in his infancy on nothing but lions' hearts and\r\nbears' marrow. This legend, however, looks much as if the true meaning\r\nof the word had been forgotten, and this was a forgery to account for\r\nit. However this may be, modern Greece and France alone repeat the name,\r\nand it is much disguised by the French pronunciation of Achille. A\r\nmartyr in Dauphiné was called Achilles; and an Achilla appears, as a\r\nlady, early in the Visconti pedigree.\r\n\r\nGallant Hector, who, perhaps, is the most endearing of all the Trojan\r\nheroes, from the perfection of his character in tenderness, devotion,\r\nand courage, and the beautiful poetry of his parting with his wife and\r\nson, bore a name that is an attribute of Zeus, Ἕκτωρ (holding fast), _i.\r\ne._, defending, from Ἕχω (hecho), to have or to hold—a word\r\nwell-befitting the resolute mainstay of a falling cause.\r\n\r\nItaly, where the descent from the Trojans was early credited and not,\r\nperhaps, impossible, is the only country where his name has been\r\ngenuinely imitated, under the form of Ettore. The Hector of Norway is\r\nbut an imitation of the old Norse Hagtar (hawk of Thor), and the very\r\nfrequent Hector of Scotland is the travestie of the Gaelic Eachan (a\r\nhorseman). In like manner the Gaelic Aonghas (excellent valour) and the\r\nWelsh Einiawn (the just), are both translated into Æneas; indeed it is\r\npossible that the early Welsh Saint, Einiawn, may indeed have been an\r\nÆneas; for, in compliment to the supposed descent of the Julii from\r\nÆneas, this name is very common in the latter times of the empire: it\r\nappears in the book of Acts, and belonged to several writers. Latterly,\r\nin the beginning of the classical taste of Italy, the name of Enea\r\nSilvio was given to that Piccolomini who afterwards became a pope. This\r\nform is in honour of that son of Æneas and Lavinia who was said to have\r\nbeen born in a wood after his father’s death. A son of the Earl of\r\nHereford was called Æneas (temp. Ed. III).\r\n\r\nThe pious Æneas owes his modern fame to Virgil. In the time of Homer,\r\neven his goddess-mother had not raised him into anything like the first\r\nrank of the heroes who fought before Troy. His name in the original is\r\nΑἰνείας (Aineias), and probably comes from αἰυέο (aineo), to praise.\r\n\r\nThe poem that no doubt suggested the _Æneid_, the Homeric story of the\r\nGreek wanderer, contains some of those elements that so wonderfully show\r\nthe kindred of far distant nations. We are content to call this\r\nwonderful poem by something approaching to its Greek title, though we\r\nare pleased to term the hero by the Latin travestie of his name—Ulysses,\r\nthe consequence, it is supposed, of some transcriber having mistaken\r\nbetween the letters Δ and Λ. The Romans, likewise, sometimes called him\r\nUlixes; the Greek σσ and ξ being, by some, considered as the same\r\nletter. Οδυσσεύς (Odysseus), his true name, is traced to the root δυς\r\n(dys), hate, the Sanscrit _dvish_, and from the same source as the Latin\r\n_odio_. Italians talked of Uliseo, and Fenelon taught the French to\r\nhonour his favourite hero as _le fils du grand Ulisse_; but the only\r\nplace where the name is now used is Ireland, probably as a classicalism\r\nfor the Danish legacy of Ulick—Hugleik, or mind reward. The Irish\r\nFinnghuala (white shoulders) was not content with the gentle native\r\nsoftenings of her name into Fenella and Nuala, but must needs translate\r\nherself into Penelope; and it is to this that we owe the numerous\r\nPenelopes of England, down from the Irish Penelope Devereux, with whom\r\nis connected the one shade on Sidney’s character, to the Pen and Penny\r\nso frequent in many families.\r\n\r\nThe faithful queen of Ithaca was probably named Πηνελόπη, or Πηνελόπεια,\r\nfrom her diligence over the loom, since πήνη (pēnē) is thread on the\r\nbobbin, πηνίζομαι is to wind it off; but a later legend declared that\r\nshe had been exposed as an infant, and owed her life to being fed by a\r\nkind of duck called πηνέλοψ (penelops), after which she was therefore\r\ncalled. This has since been made the scientific name of the turkey, and\r\ntranslators of Christian names have generally set Penelope down as a\r\nturkey-hen, in oblivion that this bird, the D'Inde of France, the\r\n_Wälsche Hahn_ of Germany, always in its name attesting its foreign\r\norigin, came from America 3000 years after the queen of Ithaca wove and\r\nunwove beneath her midnight lamp.\r\n\r\nHer son Telemachus (distant battle) had one notable namesake in the\r\ndevoted hermit who for ever ended the savage fights of the amphitheatre;\r\nbut, though Télémaque was a triumph of genius and tender religious\r\nfeeling in spite of bad pseudo-classical taste, has not been again\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nCassandra appears in Essex in 1560, and named the sister of Jane Austen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                        NAMES FROM ANIMALS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION I.—_The Lion._\r\n\r\nMuch of the spirit of the nation is to be traced in the animals whence\r\ntheir names are derived. The Jew, whose temper, except when thoroughly\r\nroused, was peaceful and gentle, had hardly any save the names of the\r\nmilder and more useful creatures: the ewe, the lamb, the bee, the fawn,\r\n&c. The Indo-European races, on the other hand, have the more brave and\r\nspirited animals, many of them running through the entire family of\r\nnations thus derived, and very possibly connected with that ‘beast\r\nepic,’ as Mr. Dasent calls it, which crops out everywhere; in the East,\r\nin apologues and fables; and towards the West, in ‘_mahrchen_,’\r\naccording to the expressive German term. It is just as if in the infancy\r\nof the world, there was the same living sympathy with the animal\r\ncreation that we see in a young child, and that the creatures had at one\r\ntime appeared to man to have an individual character, rank, and history\r\nof their own, explained by myths, in which these beings are the actors\r\nand speakers, and assumed a meaning divine, symbolic, didactic, or\r\nsimply grotesque, according to the subsequent development of the peoples\r\nby whom they were handed down.\r\n\r\nThe lion is one of these universal animals, testifying how long dim\r\nmemories of the home in Asia must have clung to the distant wanderers.\r\n\r\nLeon, or Leo, was early a favourite name among the Greeks; and Herodotus\r\nthinks, on account of its meaning, that the captive Leo was the first\r\nvictim of the Persians. It passed on in unceasing succession through\r\nGreeks of all ranks till it came to Byzantine emperors and Roman\r\nbishops. Two popes, to whom Rome owed the deepest debt of gratitude—to\r\nthe one, for interceding with Attila; to the other, for turning away the\r\nwrath of the Saracens—were both called Leo, and it thus became a\r\nfavourite on the papal throne, and was considered to allude to the Lion\r\nof the Tribe of Judah, which was therefore sculptured on St. Peter’s, in\r\nthe time of the Medicean Leo X.\r\n\r\nLeone, and Léon, and Léonie have continued in use in France and Italy.\r\nThe word has been much compounded from the earlier Greek times,\r\nLeontius, Leontia, whence the modern French Léonce. The name Leonidas,\r\nthe glorious self-devoted Spartan, after entire desuetude, has been\r\nrevived in Greece and America.\r\n\r\nThe Romanized Britons adopted the Lion name, which amongst them became\r\nLlew, the Lot of the romances of the Round Table. Here likewise figured\r\nthe gallant Sir Lionel, from whom Edward III., in chivalrous mood, named\r\nhis third son, the ancestor of the House of York. An unfortunate young\r\nDane, to whom the Dutch republic stood sponsor, received the name of Leo\r\nBelgicus. The Slavonic forms are Lev, Lav, and Lew, which, among the\r\nswarms of Jews in Poland, have become a good deal confounded with their\r\nhereditary Levi.\r\n\r\nLeandros, Leander, as we call it, means lion-man. Besides the\r\nunfortunate swimming lover whose exploit Byron imitated and Turner\r\npainted, it belonged to a sainted bishop of Seville, who, in 590,\r\neffected the transition of the Spanish Visigoths from Arianism to\r\northodoxy. Very likely his name was only a classicalizing of one of the\r\nmany Gothic names from _leut_ (the people), which are often confused\r\nwith those from the lion; but Leandro passed on as a Christian name in\r\nSpain and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe name Leocadia, a Spanish maiden martyred by the Moors, had probably\r\nsome connection with a lion; but it cannot be traced in the corrupted\r\nstate of the language. Léocadie has travelled into France.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonians have Lavoslav (lion-glory), which they make the\r\nequivalent of the Teutonic Liutpold or Leopold, really meaning the\r\npeople’s prince.\r\n\r\nLöwenhard (the stern lion, or lion strong), was a Frank noble, who was\r\nconverted at the same time as his sovereign, Clovis, and became a hermit\r\nnear Limoges. Many miracles were imputed to him, and St. Leonard became\r\na peculiarly popular saint both in France and England. Leonard is a\r\nfavourite name in France; and has some popularity in England, chiefly,\r\nit is said, in the north, and in the Isle of Wight. Lionardo is Italian,\r\nwitness Lionardo da Vinci; and, according to Gil Blas, Leonarda is a\r\nSpanish feminine; Germany has in surnames Lenhardt, Lehnart, Leinhardt,\r\nLowen; Italy invented the formidable Christian name, Brancalleone\r\n(Brachium leonis), or arm of a lion; and Bavaria has Lowenclo\r\n(lion-claw).\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  German.   │   Swiss.   │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Leonard     │Léonard     │Leonhard    │Liert       │Lionardo    │\r\n   │            │Leunairs    │Lienhard    │Liertli     │            │\r\n   │            │Launart     │Lienl       │Lienzel     │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION II.—_The Horse._\r\n\r\nThe horse is as great a favourite as the lion, and is prominent in many\r\na myth from the Caspian to the Frozen Ocean. His name in Sanscrit\r\n_açva_, in Zendish _esp_ or _asp_, comes forth in the Greek ἵππος or\r\nἵkkoς, showing its identity with the Latin _equus_, the Gaelic _each_,\r\nand it may be with the Teutonic _hengst_.\r\n\r\nAmong these various races it is the Persian, the Greek, and the Gael who\r\nhave chiefly used the term for this noble animal in their nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThe Persian feminine Damaspia is said exactly to answer to the Greek\r\nHippodameia, the female of Hippodamus (horse-tamer), and Hippos forms\r\npart of far too many Greek names to be here enumerated, except where\r\nthey have become popular elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOne would have imagined that Hippos and λύω (to destroy) must have\r\nsuggested the name of Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, who was destroyed\r\nby his own horse, terrified by a sea monster; but, on the other hand, he\r\nappears to have been named after his mother Hippolita, the beautiful\r\nqueen of the Amazons, whom Shakespeare has shown us hunting in his\r\nwondrous Attic forest. However this may be, Hippolytus has many\r\nnamesakes; among them an early Christian writer, and also a priest at\r\nRome, who in the year 252 was condemned by the persecuting judge to die\r\nthe death his name suggested. The Christians buried him in a catacomb,\r\nwhich bears his name. Sant’Ippolito became a parish church at Rome, and\r\nof course gave a title to one of the cardinals, and Ippolito and\r\nIppolita have always been fashionable Italian names. He was also the\r\npatron of horsemen and horses, and the latter were solemnly blessed in\r\nhis name. Xanthippe’s name is feminine of Xanthippus (a yellow horse!)\r\nWhat a pity it was not a grey one!\r\n\r\nThe Persian Aspamitras (horse-lover) exactly corresponds to the Greek\r\nΦίλιππoς (loving horses). Thus were named many obscure kings of Macedon,\r\nbefore that sagacious prince who prepared the future glories of his son\r\nby disciplining his army, and crushing Greece in spite of those\r\nindignant orations of Demosthenes, which have made Philippics the\r\ngeneric term for vehement individual censure.\r\n\r\nMacedon, by colonizing the East, spread Philippos over it, and thus was\r\nnamed the apostle of Bethsaida, and likewise one of the deacons, chosen\r\nfor his ‘Grecian’ connections.\r\n\r\nThe apostle was martyred at Hierapolis; nevertheless an arm of his,\r\naccording to the Bollandists, was brought to Florence from\r\nConstantinople, in 1205, and made Filippo, Filippa, Lippo, Pippo, Pippa,\r\ngreat favourites in Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nGreece and her dependent churches always used the name of Philip, or\r\nFeeleep, as they call it in Russia; and it was the eldest son of the\r\nMuscovite Anne, Queen of Henri I., who was the first Philippe to wear\r\nthe crown of France. He transmitted his name to five more kings, and to\r\nprinces innumerable, of whom one became Duke of Burgundy. His\r\ndescendant, the half Flemish, half Austrian Philippe the handsome,\r\nmarried Juana la Loca of Castille and Aragon, and their grandson was\r\nknown as Felipe II. in Spain. During his brief and ill-omened stay in\r\nEngland, he was godfather to Philip Sidney, whose name commemorated the\r\ngratitude of his mother to the King Consort for having interceded for\r\nthe life of his father the Duke of Northumberland.\r\n\r\nPhilip, in both genders, was, however, already common in England. Queen\r\nPhilippe, as she called herself, our admirable Hainaulter, was the\r\ngod-daughter of Philippe de Valois, her husband’s rival; and many a\r\nyoung noble and maiden bore her honoured name, which one female\r\ndescendant carried to Portugal, and another to Sweden, where both alike\r\nworthily sustained the honour of Plantagenet.\r\n\r\nThe name of Philippe is particularly common in the Isle of Jersey, so\r\nthat it has become a joke with sailors to torment the inhabitants by\r\ncalling them Philip as they would term an Irishman Paddy.\r\n\r\nFilippo is additionally popular in Italy at present from the favourite\r\nmodern Saint Filippo Neri.[31]\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │  French.   │  German.   │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Philip      │Phillipp    │Philippe    │Philipp     │Filippo     │\r\n   │Phil        │            │Philipot    │Lipp        │Pippo       │\r\n   │Phip        │            │            │Lipperl     │Lippo       │\r\n   │Philipp     │            │            │            │            │\r\n   │Lipp        │            │            │            │            │\r\n   │Lipperl     │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │Portuguese. │  Spanish.  │  Russian.  │   Lett.    │ Hungarian  │\r\n   │Felippe     │Felipe      │Feeleep     │Wilips      │Fülip       │\r\n   │Felipinho   │            │            │Lipsts      │            │\r\n   │Felipe      │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┤\r\n   │                            FEMININE                            │\r\n   ├────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┤\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │Portuguese. │   Dutch.   │  Italian   │\r\n   │Philippa    │Philippine  │Felipa      │Pine        │Filippa     │\r\n   │            │Flipote     │            │            │Pippa       │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Rawlinson’s _Herodotus_; Keightley’s _Mythology_; Butler; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION III.—_The Goat._\r\n\r\nThe goat (αἴξ) stands out prominently in northern mythology, though\r\nthere scarcely, if at all, used in nomenclature. In Greek mythology he\r\nappears, though not distinctly, and the names derived from him are\r\nmanifold.\r\n\r\nThe goat was the standard of Macedon (the rough goat was the King of\r\nGrecia), as Daniel had announced while Greece was yet in her infancy,\r\nand Macedon in barbarism, not even owned as of the Hellenic confederacy.\r\nThe unfortunate posthumous son of Alexander was therefore called Aigos,\r\nor Ægos, in addition to his father’s name.\r\n\r\nThe aigis, ægis, or shield of Pallas Athene, though said to bear the\r\ngorgon’s head, was probably at first a goat skin. From it is formed\r\nAigidios, Ægidius. In 475, there was an Ægidius, a Roman commander in\r\nGaul, who was for a time an independent sovereign, ruling over both\r\nRomans and Franks. About two centuries later, an Athenian, as it is\r\nsaid, by name Ægidius, having worked a miraculous cure by laying his\r\ncloak over the sick man, fled to France to avoid the veneration of the\r\npeople, and dwelt on the banks of the Rhone, living on the milk of a\r\nhind. The creature was chased by the king of France, and, flying wounded\r\nto her master, discovered him to the hunters. Thenceforth he has been\r\nrevered as St. Giles, and considered as the patron of numbers thus\r\ncalled. Now, is Giles a contraction of Ægidius, or is it the corruption\r\nof the Latin Julius; or, again, is it the Keltic Giolla, a servant, or\r\nthe Teutonic Gils, a pledge? Every one of these sounds more like it than\r\nthe Greek word, and it does seem probable that the Athenian, if Athenian\r\nhe were, was seized upon as patron by aliens to his name, and then cut\r\ndown to suit them. However, Ægidius continued to be treated as the Latin\r\nfor Giles; Egidio became an Italian name; and as St. Giles was patron of\r\nEdinburgh, Egidia was used by Scottish ladies; one of the sisters of\r\nKing Robert II. was so called, and even now it is not quite extinct.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IV.—_The Bee._\r\n\r\nThe word μείλα (soothing things) gave the verb μειλίσσω, or μελίσσω\r\n(melisso), to soothe or sweeten, whence the name of honey, and of the\r\nhoney-bee. Melissa was sometimes said to have been the name of the nymph\r\nwho first taught the use of honey, and bees, perhaps from their\r\nclustering round their queen, became the symbol of nymphs. Thence\r\nMelissa grew to be the title of a priestess as well as a lady’s name in\r\nclassic times.\r\n\r\nMelissa was invented by the Italian poets as the beneficent fairy who\r\nprotected Bradamante, and directed Ruggero to escape from Atlante, and\r\nafterwards from Alcina, upon the hippogriff. Thus she entered the domain\r\nof romance, and became confounded with the Melusine and Melisende, who\r\nhad risen out of the Teutonic Amalaswinth; and Melisse and Melite were\r\nadopted into French nomenclature.\r\n\r\nAkin to Melissa is Γλυκηρά (Glykera), the sweet. This was not a feminine\r\nin good repute in ancient Athens, but it has since belonged to a saint\r\nof the Greek Churches, namely, the daughter of Macarius, thrice consul,\r\nwho in the time of Antoninus suffered torments for a long time at\r\nTrajanopolis; and Gloukera is prevalent in Russia; and Glykera, or\r\nGlycère, in France.[33]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Keightley’s _Fairy Mythology_; Croker’s _Fairy Legends_; Tooke’s\r\n  _History of Russia_; Butler.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Professor Munch; Junius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION V.—_Names from Flowers._\r\n\r\nIt was not common in Greece to name persons from flowers, but two names\r\nin occasional use are connected with legends of transformation, though\r\nin each case it is evident that the name belonged originally to the\r\nflower, and then was transferred to the man.\r\n\r\nThus the Narcissus, named undoubtedly from ναρκάω (narkao), to put to\r\nsleep, has become the object of a graceful legend of the cold-hearted\r\nyouth, for whose sake the nymph Echo pined away into a mere voice, and\r\nin retribution was made to see his own beauty in the water and waste\r\nfrom hopeless love for his own image, until his corpse became the\r\ndrooping golden blossom, that loves to hang above still pools of water,\r\nlike the “dancing daffodils” of Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nNarcissus seems to have been a name among the Greek slaves of the\r\nRomans, for we twice find it belonging to freedmen of the Emperor. St.\r\nNarcissus was Bishop of Jerusalem in 195, and presided at the council\r\nthat fixed the great festival of the Resurrection on a Sunday instead of\r\non the day fixed by the full moon like the Jews. The Russians call it\r\nNarkiss; the Romans, Narcisso; and it has even been found belonging to\r\nan English peasant.\r\n\r\nHyacinthus (Ὑάκινθος) was a beautiful Spartan youth, who, being\r\naccidentally killed by Apollo in a game with the discus, was caused by\r\nthe sorrowing divinity to propagate from his blood a flower bearing on\r\nits petals either his initial Υ or the αί (alas), the cry of\r\nlamentation. A yearly feast was held at Sparta in honour of Hyacinthus,\r\nand his name was perpetuated till Christian times, when a martyr bore it\r\nat Rome, and thus brought it into favour in Italy as Giacinto; also a\r\nPolish Dominican Jacinthus in the thirteenth century, is commemorated as\r\nthe Apostle of the North, because he preached Christianity in great part\r\nof Russia and Tartary; but curiously enough it is in Ireland alone that\r\nHyacinth has ever flourished as a man’s name, probably as a supposed\r\nequivalent to some native Erse name. There it is very common among the\r\npeasantry, and is in common use as Sinty, while in France, Italy, and\r\nSpain, though apparently without a saintly example of their own sex,\r\nJacinthe, Giacinta, and Jacinta are always feminine, and rather popular\r\npeasant names.\r\n\r\nῬόδος (Rhodos), the rose, is a word connected in its source with the\r\norigin of the Teuton _roth_, Keltic _ruadh_, and Latin _rufus_. Roses\r\nare the same in almost every tongue, and they almost always suggest\r\nfemale names; of which the most interesting to us is Rhoda, “the\r\nhousehold maid, of her own joy afraid,” who “opened not the gate for\r\ngladness” when she knew the voice of St. Peter as he stood without the\r\ndoor after his release from prison and death. Her name, as a Scripture\r\none, has had some use in England, though, in general, the Roses of each\r\ncountry have grown upon their own national grafts from the one great\r\nstock, or, more strangely, are changed from horses.\r\n\r\nΦύλλις (Phyllis), a green leaf or bough, has another story of\r\ntransformation. She was a Thalian damsel who hung herself because her\r\nlover did not keep his promise of returning to marry her, and was\r\naccordingly changed into an almond tree. Phyllis was the name of\r\nDomitian’s nurse, and in process of time found her way among the\r\ndramatis personæ of Arcadian poetry; and arrived at being somewhat\r\npopular as a name in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n             HISTORICAL GREEK NAMES CONSISTING OF EPITHETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION I.—_Agathos._\r\n\r\nAfter passing from the fascinating but confused tales and songs that\r\ngroup around the ship Argo, the doomed family of Œdipus, and the siege\r\nof Troy, the Greeks are well-nigh lost for a time, but emerge again in\r\nthe full and distinct brilliancy of the narratives of Herodotus and his\r\nfollowers, who have rendered their small aggregate of fragmentary states\r\nand their gallant resistance to Asiatic invasion the great nucleus of\r\ninterest in the ancient world.\r\n\r\nIn the days of these wise and brave men, the nomenclature was, for the\r\nmost part, expressive and appropriate, consisting of compounds of words\r\nof good augury from the spoken language, and, usually, as has been\r\nbefore shown, with a sort of recurring resemblance, from generation to\r\ngeneration, so as to make the enumeration of a pedigree significant and\r\nharmonious.\r\n\r\nOf these was ἀγαθός (the good), precisely the same word as our own\r\n_good_ and the German _guth_, only with the commencing α and a Greek\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nClassical times showed many an Agathon, and Agathias, and numerous\r\ncompounds, such as Agathocles (good fame), to be repeated in the\r\nTeutonic Gudred, and other varieties; but the abiding use of the word as\r\nan European name was owing to a Sicilian girl, called Agatha, who in the\r\nDecian persecution was tortured to death at Rome. Sicily considered her\r\nas one of its guardian saints. Thus, the festival day of this martyred\r\nvirgin is observed by both the Eastern and Western Churches, and her\r\nname is found among all the nations that ever possessed her native\r\nisland. Greece has transmitted it to Russia, where the _th_ not being\r\npronounceable, it is called Agafia; and the masculine, which is there\r\nused, Agafon; and the Slavonian nations derive it from the same quarter.\r\nThe Normans adopted it and sent it home to their sisters in Neustria,\r\nwhere it was borne by that daughter of William the Conqueror who was\r\nbetrothed to the unfortunate Earl Edwin, and afterwards died on her way\r\nto a state marriage in Castille. In her probably met the Teutonic Gytha\r\nand the Greek Agatha, identical in meaning and root, and almost in\r\nsound, though they had travelled to her birth-place in Rouen by two such\r\ndifferent routes from their Eastern starting-place. Agatha was once much\r\nmore common as a name than at present in England, and seems still to\r\nprevail more in the northern than the southern counties. Haggy, or\r\nAgatha, is the maid-servant’s name in Southey’s _Doctor_, attesting its\r\nprevalence in that class before hereditary or peculiar names were\r\ndiscarded as at present.\r\n\r\nFrance did not fail to take up Agatha. Spain had her Agatha like that of\r\nthe Italians, both alike omitting the _h_ of θ. Portugal makes it\r\nAgneda; and the only other change worth noting is that the Letts cut it\r\nshort into Apka.\r\n\r\nAristos (best) was a favourite commencement with the Greeks. Aristides,\r\nmost just of men, was thus called the son of the best. He has reappeared\r\nin his proper form in modern Greece; as Aristide in republican France;\r\nas Aristides in America.\r\n\r\nAristobulus (best counsel) came originally from an epithet of Artemis,\r\nto whom Themistocles built a temple at Athens, as Aristoboulè, the best\r\nadviser. It was very common in the various branches of the Macedonian\r\nempire, and was thus adopted in the Asmonean family, from whom it came\r\nto the Herodian race, and thence spread among the Jews. In the Epistle\r\nto the Romans, St. Paul sends his greetings to the household of\r\nAristobulus; and Welsh ecclesiastical antiquaries endeavour to prove\r\nthat Arwystli, whom the Triads say was brought by Bran the blessed to\r\npreach the Gospel in Britain, was the same with this person.\r\n\r\nAristarchus (best judge) is also a Scriptural name; and besides these we\r\nhave Aristocles (best fame), Aristippos (best horse), Aristagoras (best\r\nassembly), and all the other usual Greek compounds among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is the fittest place to mention that Arethusa is in use\r\namong the modern Greeks, and interpreted by them to mean the virtuous,\r\nas coming from this source. Aretino has been used in Italy.[34]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Jameson; Rees, _Welsh Saints_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION II.—_Alexander, &c._\r\n\r\nConquering Macedon was the portion of Greece, if Greece it could be\r\ncalled, that spread its names most widely and permanently; and as was\r\nbut right, no name was more universally diffused than that of the great\r\nvictor, he who in history is as prominent as Achilles in poetry.\r\nἈλέξανδρος (Alexandros), from ἀλέξω (alexo), to help, and ἄνδρες\r\n(andres), men, was said to have been the title given to Paris by the\r\nshepherds among whom he grew up, from his courage in repelling robbers\r\nfrom the flocks. It was afterwards a regular family name among the kings\r\nof Macedon, he who gave it fame being the third who bore it. So much\r\nrevered as well as feared was this mighty conqueror, that his name still\r\nlives in proverb and song throughout the East. The Persians absolutely\r\nadopted him into their own line, and invented a romance by which\r\n‘Secunder’ was made the son of a native monarch. Among the eastern\r\nnations, Iskander became such a by-word for prowess, that even in the\r\nsixteenth century the Turks would find no greater title of fear for\r\ntheir foe, the gallant Albanian, Georgios Kastriotes, than Skander Beg,\r\nor Lord Alexander.\r\n\r\nNot only did the great conqueror possess many namesakes,—as indeed,\r\nthere is a story that all the children born the year of his conquest of\r\nIndia were called after him,—but Alexandros was already frequent in\r\nGreece; and among the kingdoms formed out of the fragments of his\r\nempire, it recurred so as to become usual all over the Græcized East.\r\nEven the Maccabean Jews used it, and it was common in Judea, as well as\r\nelsewhere, in the time of the Gospels, so that a large proportion of\r\nsaints and martyrs bore it and handed it on, especially in Greece and\r\nItaly. A pope, martyred in the second century, rendered it a papal\r\nassumed name; and the Italians used it frequently as Alessandro,\r\nshortened into Sandro. Nowhere, however, is it so thoroughly national as\r\nin Scotland, imported thither, apparently, with other Greek names, by\r\nMargaret Ætheling, who learnt them in the Hungarian court where she was\r\nborn and brought up. Her third son was the first of the three Scottish\r\nAlexanders, under whom the country spent her most prosperous days.\r\n\r\nNo wonder his namesakes were numerous. In the Highlands they came to be\r\nAlaster, and formed the surname MacAlister; in the south, the\r\ncontractions were Alick, Saunders, or Sandy, and the feminine Alexa,\r\nAlexandrina, and Alexandra, are chiefly German and Russian, though now\r\nand then occurring in France.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this name, Alexios, a defender, was in use in ancient\r\nGreece, where it belonged to a noted sculptor. Its saintly honours did\r\nnot begin till the fifth century, when a young Roman noble, called\r\nAllexius or Alexis, is said to have been so much bent on a monastic\r\nlife, that being compelled by his parents to marry, he fled away on his\r\nwedding day, and lived seventeen years in a convent in Syria; but,\r\nfinding his reputation for sanctity too much for his humility, he came\r\nhome in guise of a poor pilgrim, and spent another seventeen years as a\r\nbeggar maintained on the scraps of his father’s kitchen, and constantly\r\nmocked and misused by the servants, until in his dying moments, he made\r\nhimself known to his parents. His church at Rome, called St. Alessio,\r\ngives a title to a cardinal; and his day, July 17th, is observed by the\r\nGreeks as well as the Romans; and yet so strange is his history that it\r\nalmost seems as if it might have been one of those instances in which an\r\nallegory acquired the name of a real saint, and attached itself to him\r\nas a legend. Alessio has in consequence always been an Italian name, and\r\nwith the family of the Komnenoi, Alexios came into use among the\r\nByzantine Greeks, with whom it was very frequent. Alexia is often found\r\nas a lady’s name in old records and accounts of the middle ages; but it\r\nis apparently intended merely as the Latin equivalent for Alice, which\r\nwe shall show by-and-by to have had an entirely different origin.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │  French.   │  Italian.  │Spanish.    │\r\n   │Alexander   │Alexander   │Alexandre   │Alessandro  │Alejandro   │\r\n   │Alex        │Alick       │            │            │            │\r\n   │            │Sanders     │            │            │            │\r\n   │            │Sandy       │            │            │            │\r\n   │            │Sawny       │            │            │            │\r\n   │            │Elshender   │            │            │            │\r\n   │            │Elshie      │            │            │            │\r\n   │            │Alaster     │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Russian.  │  Polish.   │ Slavonic.  │    Ung.    │            │\r\n   │Aleksander  │Aleksander  │Aleksander  │Sandor      │            │\r\n   │Ssachka     │Leszek      │Skender     │            │            │\r\n   │Ssaschinka  │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┤\r\n   │                            FEMININE                            │\r\n   ├────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┤\r\n   │  English.  │  Italian.  │Portuguese. │  Spanish.  │            │\r\n   │Alexis      │Alessio     │Aleixo      │Alejo       │            │\r\n   │Alexis      │            │            │            │            │\r\n   │Alexe       │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Russian.  │ Slavonic.  │  Servian.  │ Lusatian.  │ Hungarian. │\r\n   │Alexei      │Ales        │Aleksa      │Alex        │Elek        │\r\n   │Alescha     │Leks        │            │Halex       │            │\r\n   │            │            │            │Holex       │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION III.—_Anēr, Andros._\r\n\r\nWe come to the names derived from ἀνήρ, gen. ἀνδρός (anēr, andros), a\r\nman. The word itself has connections in the Sanscrit _nara_, and Zend\r\n_ner_; but its compounds are all from its oblique cases.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of these is formed by the corrupt Greek dialect\r\nused in Syria, namely, that which fell to Ανδρέας (Andreas), the\r\nGalilean fisherman, whom the Church Universal reveres as one of the\r\nforemost in the Glorious Company of the Apostles. The saint was martyred\r\nat Patras in Achaia, whence some of his relics were carried in the\r\nfourth century to Scotland, and were thus the occasion of St. Andrew’s\r\nbecoming the Metropolitan see. Shortly after, the vision of Hungus, King\r\nof the Picts, of St. Andrew’s Cross, promising him victory, rendered the\r\nwhite saltire the national ensign, and St. Andrew became not only the\r\npatron saint, but in due time the knightly champion of Scotland, and\r\nmade Andrew one of the most universal of names, and the patronymic\r\nAnderson very common. The other relics went first to Constantinople, and\r\nafter the taking of that city, were dispersed through Europe. Philip the\r\nGood, of Burgundy, obtained some of them, and made St. Andrew the patron\r\nof the order of the Golden Fleece, and Andreas became a frequent Flemish\r\nand Dutch name.

The Russians\r\nuse Andrean as an equivalent for Henry!\r\n\r\nAndronicus, man’s victory, was a great favourite, and occurs in St.\r\nPaul’s Epistle to the Romans, probably having belonged to a Corinthian\r\nwho had gone from the busy city of traffic on the Isthmus to the great\r\nCapital of the world. The name continued among the Greeks, and belonged\r\nto numerous emperors, but has not been subsequently in much favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION IV.—_Eu._\r\n\r\nThe word εὖ (well or happily) was the commencement of many a name of\r\ngood augury from the earliest times, and mingles as much among Christian\r\nas among classical associations.\r\n\r\nThus in company with ἄγγελος, angelos (a messenger), it formed\r\nevangelus, happy messenger, or bearer of good tidings, the first time\r\napplied to a shepherd, who brought to Ephesus the tidings of a quarry of\r\nbeautiful marble for the building of the temple that was the glory of\r\nthe city and of all Asia. Adored with heroic honours as he was, the\r\ntitle must have seemed to the Ephesian Christians, above all, to befit\r\nthose spiritual shepherds who brought the best of tidings, and\r\nEvangelista became the term for a preacher, as Evangelium of his\r\ndoctrine, both becoming in time restricted to the four-writers of the\r\npersonal history of our Lord, and their narrative, as being the very\r\ncore and centre of the Good Tidings. Evangelista was an old Italian\r\nname; and Longfellow appears to have invented Evangeline for the heroine\r\nof his poem, whence many of the name have sprung up in America.\r\n\r\nΕὔχειρ (Eucheir), dexterous hand, was no doubt at first a mere epithet\r\nof a sculptor, but afterwards considered as a name, and belonging to no\r\nless than four distinguished sculptors of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nThence the Latinized Eucherius, which belonged to a Bishop of Lyons, a\r\ngreat author of ecclesiastical works, who died about A.D. 450; from him\r\ncomes the Portuguese Euchario, the Italian Eucario, the French Euchaire,\r\nthe Russian Jevcharij, the Polish Euckary.\r\n\r\nΕὐδώρη (Eudora), happy gift, was one of the Nereids, and afterwards did\r\nduty as Eudore in French romance.\r\n\r\nEudocia and Eudoxia are so much alike as to be often confused, but have\r\ndifferent significations. The first is Εὐδοκία (approval), the second\r\nΕὐδοξία (good fame of glory). Both were great favourites with the Greek\r\nempresses, and were assumed by imperial brides possessed of some\r\nappellation not supposed to befit the purple. Saints of the Greek Church\r\nhanded Eudokhia on into Russia, where it has been worn upon the throne,\r\nand becomes in common parlance Jevdoksija.\r\n\r\nΕὐγενή (Eugenes), well born, was a very old Greek author; but Eugenios\r\nwas the more usual form in classical times, and was carried on as\r\nEugenius by the Romans. St. Eugenius was an African Confessor, and\r\nanother Eugenius was Bishop of Toledo in 646. Both these gave much\r\npopularity to their name; the first in the East, the second in Italy,\r\nwhere Eugênio came to that high-spirited Savoyard who, growing weary of\r\nlingering at the court of Louis XIV., and hearing himself called _le\r\npetit Abbé du Roi_, rendered the sound of Prince Eugène dear to Austria\r\nand England; terrible to France and Turkey. Foe as he was, it is to his\r\nfame that the great popularity of Eugène in France is owing, whilst even\r\nin the country for which he fought Eugen is far less common. The\r\nRussians have it as Jevgenij; and the Servians as Djoulija; indeed, well\r\nmay these last remember the gallant prince who turned back the wave of\r\nTurkish invasion.\r\n\r\nEugenius stands forth again and again in the early roll of Scottish\r\nkings, but whether these sovereigns ever lived or not, their appellation\r\nwas certainly not Eugenius, nor any corruption from it; but the Keltic\r\nEoghan, Ewan, or Evan, still extremely common in the Highlands, and\r\nmeaning a young warrior, though, after the favourite custom of the Gael,\r\nAnglicized and Latinized by names of similar sound. The Welsh Owain or\r\nYwain appears to have had the same fate, as the first means a lamb; but\r\nthis is not equally certain, as the British had many Latin and Greek\r\nnames current among them, and this _may_ be a corruption of Eugenius.\r\n\r\nEugenia was a virgin Roman martyr, of whom very little is known; but\r\nthis convenient feminine for Eugène has been in favour in the countries\r\nwhere the masculine was popular, and the Empress Eugénie rendered it the\r\nreigning name in France.\r\n\r\nThe names beginning with this favourite adverb are almost beyond\r\nenumeration, and it is only possible to select those of any modern\r\ninterest. Εὐνίκη (Eunike), Eunice, happy victory, was one of the fifty\r\nNereids, from whom the name passed to Greek women, and thus to Eunice,\r\nthe Jewish mother of Timothy, whence this has become a favourite with\r\nEnglish lovers of Bible names.\r\n\r\nJohn Bunyan would have been reminded of his town of _Fair Speech_ by the\r\nnumber of Greeks called by words of this signification: Eulalius,\r\nEulogius, Euphemius, all with their feminines, besides Euphrasia.\r\n\r\nThe feminines were more enduring than the masculines. Eulalia was a\r\nchild of ten or twelve years old, who, with that peculiar exaggeration\r\nof feeling that distinguishes Spanish piety, made her escape from the\r\nplace of safety where her parents had taken refuge, entered Merida, and\r\nproclaiming herself a Christian, was martyred with the utmost extremity\r\nof torture in the persecution of Diocletian, and was sung by the great\r\nChristian poet Prudentius, himself a Spaniard. His verses spread her\r\nfame into the East, where the Russians carry on her name as Jevlalija;\r\nthe Servians, as Evlalija or Lelica. Another virgin martyr of the same\r\nname, under the same persecution, died at Barcelona, whence her relics\r\nspread into Guienne and Languedoc, and thus named the villages of Ste.\r\nOlaille, Ste. Aulazie, and Ste. Aulaire, the last a familiar seignoral\r\ntitle! Eulalia and Eulalie have been often used in Spain and France, and\r\nthe former is found in the register of Ottery St. Mary, Devon—also\r\nfrequently in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nEuphemia originally meant at once fair speech and abstinence from the\r\nreverse, so that almost in irony it signified silence, and was applied\r\nto the stillness that prevailed during religious rites, or to the\r\nproclamation of silence. The Euphemia who was the parent of the\r\nwide-spread name, was a virgin-martyr of Bithynia, whose legend of\r\nconstancy, unshaken and invulnerable, alike by lion and flame, strongly\r\nimpressed both the East and the West. Jevfimija, in Russia; Jeva, in\r\nServia; Bema, in Lusatia; and Pimmie, in Lithuania. Then she is almost\r\nas much changed as by the Effie and Phemie of Scotland, which together\r\nwith Euphame have prevailed since very early times. It is a question\r\nwhether this Scottish Euphame were really one of the Greek names brought\r\nfrom Hungary by Queen Margaret, or if it be only another attempt to\r\ntranslate the Keltic Aoiffe. In the Highlands, however, the name is\r\ncalled Oighrigh; which, to English eyes and ears, seems equally distant\r\nfrom either Aoiffe or Euphemia. The church of Santa Eufemia at Rome\r\ngives title to a cardinal, and has spread the name in Italy and France.\r\n\r\nIt remains somewhat doubtful whether Eustace should be referred to\r\nΕὐστᾶθηος (steadfast), or to Εὔσταχος (happy in harvest). The Eostafie,\r\nor Eustathius, of the Greco-Slavonic Church, certainly has the same\r\nfestival-day (September 20th) as the Eustachius of the Latin; but the\r\nLatin Church has _likewise_ a St. Eustachius, a different personage with\r\na different day. He of September 20th was a Roman soldier, who lived and\r\nsuffered under the Emperor Adrian, but his wild poetical legend is\r\naltogether a work of the Western mind. It begins like that of St.\r\nHubert, with his conversion by the apparition of a crucifix planted\r\nbetween the horns of a stag, and a voice telling him that he should\r\nsuffer great things. A soldier saint was sure to be a great favourite in\r\nthe middle ages, and the supposed transport of St. Eustace’s relics to\r\nSt. Denis, in very early times, filled France with Eustache, and thence\r\nEustace, Wistace, or Huistace, as English tongues were pleased to call\r\nit, came over in plenty at the Norman Conquest. Eustace ‘Comes,’ who\r\nholds land in Domesday Book before the Conquest, must have been he of\r\nBoulogne who had such a desperate quarrel with the Godwin sons. There\r\nwere six householders of this name after the Conquest, and they, or\r\ntheir descendants, sometimes called their daughters Eustachie, or\r\nEustachia. Eustachia, a kinswoman of Henry II., married Geoffrey de\r\nMandeville; and Eustacie was once in favour in France; but all these\r\nhave a good deal lost their popularity, though we sometimes hear of\r\nEustace in these days. The Bavarian contraction is Staches. Eusebius and\r\nEusebia mean gentle or holy, and have not been frequent.[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION V.—_Hieros._\r\n\r\nThe word ἵερος (hieros), sacred, gave the term for a priest, or any\r\nother person or thing set apart, and thus formed several names in the\r\nfamily of the kings of Syracuse, Hieron, Hieracles (holy fame),\r\nHieronymus, _i. e._ Ἱερώνυμος (with a holy name). These continued in use\r\namong the Greeks, and came at length to that Dalmatian scholar and\r\nhermit, Eusebius Hieronymus Sophronius, who is reckoned as one of the\r\ngreatest of the Latin fathers. As a saint of high reputation, his name\r\nunderwent the Italian process of changing its aspirate into a _G_, and\r\nhe became San Geronimo, or even Girolamo, whence the French took their\r\nfrequent Jerome, and we followed their example. The Germans did indeed\r\nhold fast to Hieronymus; and the old English reformers would quote St.\r\nHierom; but Jerome is the abiding name by which the saint, his\r\nnamesakes, and the friars who took his rule are called.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, Jerome, like Jeremiah and Edward, has been forced into\r\nrepresenting the good old Keltic Diarmaid.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │  Portuguese.  │   Spanish.    │    Italian    │\r\n   │Hierom         │Jeromino       │Jeromo         │Geronimo       │\r\n   │               │Hieronimo      │Jeromino       │Girolamo       │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    French.    │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │    Servian    │\r\n   │Jerôme         │Jeronim        │Hieronim       │Jerolim        │\r\n   │               │               │Hirus          │Jerko          │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nIn Cambrai, Hieronome was the form, with the Hieronomette for a\r\nfeminine; and among the Swinburnes of Yorkshire, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Jeronima thrice occurs.[36]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Smith; Jameson; Sir Isumbras; Ellis, _Domesday\r\n  Book_; Michaelis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Smith; Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION VI.—_Pan._\r\n\r\nA few words beginning with πᾶς (all) must here be mentioned, such as\r\nPankratios (all ruling). A boy thus called is said to have suffered at\r\nRome, in his 14th year, in 304, under Diocletian. Even in the time of\r\nGregory of Tours, it was supposed that certain vengeance followed false\r\noaths made at his shrine, and his relics were therefore very valuable. A\r\npresent of some from Pope Vitalian to our King Oswy brought St. Pancras\r\ninto fashion in England, and Pancrace and Pancragio have also named many\r\nchurches in France and Italy. The lily called _pancratium_ claims by its\r\nname to excel all others.\r\n\r\nΠανταλέων, Pantaleon (altogether a lion), was one of the numerous\r\nChristian physicians who suffered martyrdom. He died at Nicodemia, but\r\nhis relics were brought to Constantinople, and thence to France, where\r\nhe is the chief saint of the largest church at Lyons, and he is the\r\npatron of doctors next after St. Luke. His name was in use in France and\r\nItaly before. As a peasant name, he fell, with Arlechino and Colombina,\r\ninto comedy. His dress was on the stage made to fit tight to his body,\r\nas if all in one piece, and he was always a feeble old man, whence\r\nShakespeare speaks of the lean and slippered pantaloon. Thence again,\r\nwhen the entire leg was covered by the trousers instead of by stockings\r\nand breeches meeting at the knee, the name of pantaloon was applied to\r\nthe new garment.\r\n\r\nΝίκη (victory) was an auspicious word, which, being of feminine gender,\r\nas befitted a goddess, was a favourite close for women’s names; such as\r\nStratonike (army victory), Φερενίκη, Pherenike (bringing victory).\r\nBerenike was the Macedonian pronunciation of this last, and was in\r\nconstant use among princesses of the two Greek kingdoms of Syria and\r\nEgypt. From these ladies, those of the Herod family took the name, and\r\nthus it was borne by that Bernice who heard St. Paul’s defence. Oddly\r\nenough, the peasants of Normandy are fond of calling their daughters\r\nBerenice. Veronica is sometimes said likewise to be a corrupt form.\r\n\r\nIn men’s names Nike was the prefix, as in Nikon, Niklias, Nikodemos\r\n(conquering people), Nikolaos (Νίκολαος), a word of like meaning. This\r\nlast, after belonging to one of the seven first deacons, and to the\r\nfounder of a heresy doomed in the Apocalypse, came to the Bishop of\r\nMyra, from whom it acquired a curious legendary fame that made it\r\nuniversal. St. Nicholas is said to have supplied three destitute maidens\r\nwith marriage portions by secretly leaving money at their window, and as\r\nhis day occurred just before Christmas, he thus was made the purveyor of\r\nthe gifts of the season to all children in Flanders and Holland, who put\r\nout their shoe or stocking in the confidence that Santa Klaus or Knecht\r\nClobes, as they call him, will put in a prize for good conduct before\r\nthe morning. The Dutch element in New England has introduced Santa Klaus\r\nto many a young American who knows nothing of St. Nicholas or of any\r\nsaint’s day. Another legend described the saint as having brought three\r\nmurdered children to life again, and this rendered him the patron of\r\nboys, especially school-boys.\r\n\r\nA saint of both the East and West, with a history so endearing, and\r\nlegends still more homely and domestic, Nicholas was certain of many\r\nfollowers throughout Christendom, and his name came into use in Europe\r\namong the first of the sainted ones. To us it came with the Norman\r\nConquest, though not in great abundance, for only one Nicolas figures in\r\nDomesday Book, but his namesakes multiplied. The only English pope was\r\nNicolas Breakspear; and Nicole or Nicola de Camville was the brave lady\r\nwho defeated the French invaders at Lincoln, and secured his troublesome\r\ncrown to Henry III. She deserves to have had more ladies called after\r\nher in her own country, but the feminines are chiefly confined to\r\nFrance, where, in the fifteenth century, its contraction was beatified\r\nin the person of a shoemaker’s daughter, Collette Boilet, who reformed\r\nthe nuns of St. Clara, and died in the odour of sanctity. The southern\r\nnations almost always contract their names by the omission of the first\r\nsyllables, as the northern ones do by leaving out the latter ones; and\r\nthus, while the English have Nick, the Italians speak of Cola, a\r\ncontraction that became historical when the strange fortunes of “Cola di\r\nRienzi, the tribune of the people,” raised him to his giddy height of\r\nhonour, and then dashed him down so suddenly and violently, that “You\r\nunfortunate Rienzi” has ever since been a proverbial expression of pity\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nThe French language generally has both varieties of contractions,\r\nperhaps according as it was influenced by the Provençal or the Frank\r\npronunciation, and thus its Nicolas becomes Nicole or Colas, sometimes\r\nColin. Thence it has been suggested that Colin Maillard, or\r\nblind-man’s-buff, may be Colin seeking Maillard, the diminutive of\r\nMarie, which would drolly correspond to the conjecture that the “N or M”\r\nof our catechism and marriage service, instead of being merely the\r\nconsonants of _nomen_, stand for Nicholas and Mary as the most probable\r\nnames. The French Colin is probably Nicolas, and is the parent of all\r\nthe Arcadian Colins who piped to their shepherdesses either in the rural\r\ntheatricals of the ancient regime, in Chelsea china, or in pastoral\r\npoetry. The Scottish Colin may, perhaps, have been slightly influenced\r\nby French taste, but he bears no relation to Nicolas, being, in fact,\r\nformed from the Irish missionary, Saint Columba. The true Scottish\r\ndescendant of the patron of scholars is to be found in that quaint\r\nportrait, Baillie Nicol Jarvie. The _h_ with which Nicolas is usually\r\nspelt in English was probably introduced in the seventeenth century,\r\nwhich seemed to think good spelling consisted in the insertion of\r\nsuperfluous letters.\r\n\r\nNiel, a pure Keltic word, which was adopted by the Northmen, and became\r\nnaturalized in Scandinavia and Normandy, has also been translated by\r\nNicolas, but quite incorrectly. Nils is the only _real_ Nicolaus except\r\nKlaus used in the North, though Niel, and even Nigel, are sometimes\r\nconfounded with it. Denmark has had a King Klaus; otherwise this popular\r\nname has only been on the throne in the instance of that great Tzar whom\r\nwe had respected till the last year of his life, when his aggression\r\nforced us into war.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    French.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Nicholas       │Nicol          │Nicolas        │Nikolaus       │\r\n   │Nick           │               │Nicole         │Niklaas        │\r\n   │Nicol          │Colas          │Colin          │Klaus          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Nils           │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Dutch.     │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │               │\r\n   │Niklaas        │Nikolaus       │Niklau         │Swiss.         │\r\n   │Klasse         │Niklas         │Nickel         │Chlaus         │\r\n   │               │Klaus          │Likelas        │               │\r\n   │               │Nikolaus       │Klasl          │               │\r\n   │               │Niklas         │               │               │\r\n   │               │Klaus          │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │  Portuguese.  │   Russian.    │   Slavonic.   │\r\n   │Nicola         │Nicolaio       │Nikolaj        │Nikola         │\r\n   │Nicolo         │               │Nikolascha     │Miklaoz        │\r\n   │Cola           │               │Kolinka        │               │\r\n   │               │               │Kolja          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │     Lett.     │   Finland.    │      Ung.     │\r\n   │Mikolej        │Klavinsh       │Laus           │Mikos          │\r\n   │               │Klassis        │Nilo           │   Lapland.    │\r\n   │               │               │Niku           │Nikka          │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe German Sieg answers exactly to the Greek Nike.\r\n\r\nWith the _a_ before it, which in Greek contradicts the ensuing word,\r\nlike the Latin _in_, and Teutonic _un_, we have Ἀνίκητoς, Aniketos,\r\nAnicetus, unconquered, the name of a pope, a friend of St. Polycarp, and\r\nan opponent of heresy, whence he is a saint both of East and West, and\r\nis called Aniceto at Rome, Anicet in France, and Anikita in Russia.[37]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Rollin; Jameson; Butler; Michaelis; Ellis,\r\n  _Domesday Book_; Warton, _English Poetry_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VII.—_Polys._\r\n\r\nΠoλύς (Polys), much, very, or many, was a frequent opening for Greek\r\nnames. Polydoros (Πoλύδωρος), many-gifted, was the youngest and last\r\nsurvivor of the sons of Priam; and as mediæval Europe had a strong\r\nfeeling for the fate of Troy, and the woes of ‘Polydore’ had an especial\r\nattraction for them, so Polidoro was revived in Italy, and has never\r\nquite died away.\r\n\r\nHis sister Polyxena, the feminine of very hospitable, had an equally\r\npiteous fate, being slain by the Greeks at the tomb of Achilles.\r\nAccording to the legends of the Eastern Church, a lady named Eusebia\r\n(gentle), who had been born at Rome, fled from an enforced marriage with\r\na king, and took refuge, first at Alexandria, and then in the Isle of\r\nCos, where she was called Xena, or the stranger. She founded a monastery\r\nat Mylassa in Caria, and there died in the 5th century. Kseenia, as she\r\nis called in Russia, has many namesakes, and probably was made\r\nornamental by being lengthened into Poliksenja, which is likewise in\r\nuse, with the contraction Polinka; and Polixene has also been used from\r\nan early period in Germany.\r\n\r\nΠολύευκτος (Polyeuctos), much longed for, answering to the Desiderio of\r\nItaly, and Desirée of France, was an old classic name, and an officer\r\nwho was martyred in Lesser Armenia about the middle of the third\r\ncentury, was placed in the martyrology of both East and West; but only\r\nhas namesakes in Russia, where he is called Polieukt.\r\n\r\nΠολύκαρπος (Polycarpos), that glorious Bishop of Smyrna, “faithful unto\r\ndeath,” and “receiving a crown of life when he played the man in the\r\nfire,” has had still fewer imitators of his suitable Christian name,\r\nmuch-fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VIII.—_Phile, &c._\r\n\r\nΦίλος (Philos) was a most obvious and natural opening for names. It\r\nstood alone as that of several Macedonian ladies, and again with\r\nnumerous men called Philon.\r\n\r\nPhilemon (loving thought) was the good old Phrygian who, with his wife\r\nBaucis, entertained Zeus and Hermes, and were rewarded with safety when\r\ntheir churlish neighbours were destroyed. Philemon was very common among\r\nthe Greeks, and the Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossian master of the\r\nrunaway Onesimus, has made it one of the Scriptural names of the\r\nEnglish. The Maories call it Pirimona.\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemys of Egypt were particularly fond of surnaming themselves\r\nafter their love to their relations, though they generally contrived so\r\nto treat them as to make the epithet sound ironical: Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphos (love brother), _because_ he murdered his brother; Ptolemy\r\nPhilopater, _because_ he poisoned his father; though at least Philometer\r\ndoes seem to have had a good mother, and to have loved her. Such\r\nsurnames were imitated by the Greek kings of Pergamus, all of whom were\r\nnamed Attalus, and it was from Attalus Philadelphus, the second of them,\r\nthat the city of Philadelphia, mentioned in the Apocalypse, took its\r\ntitle. This perished city of brotherly love seemed to William Penn to\r\nafford a suitable precedent for the title of the capital of his Quaker\r\ncolony, which has ever since been Philadelphia. Less happily,\r\nPhiladelphia has even been used among English women, apparently desirous\r\nof a large mouthful of a name.\r\n\r\nWhether Philadelphia set the fashion, or whether the length of name is\r\nthe allurement, Americans have a decided turn for all these\r\ncommencements with ‘Phile’; and Philetus, Philander, &c., are to be\r\nfound continually among the roughest inhabitants of the backwoods and\r\nfar-west. With us they are at a discount, probably owing to the fashion\r\nof the last century of naming imaginary characters from the qualities\r\nthey possessed.\r\n\r\nPhilaret, fond of virtue, is however popular in Russia, for the sake of\r\nsome Eastern saint, who no doubt derived it from Philaretos, a Greek\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nThe verb πράσσω (prasso), to do or act, and the substantives πρᾶγμα\r\n(pragma), πρᾶξις (praxis), business, were fertile in derivatives.\r\n\r\nThe Christian interest of the words from this source is through\r\nPraxedes, who, according to the legend, was the daughter of the house in\r\nwhich St. Peter lodged at Rome, and devoted herself, together with her\r\nsister, to attending on Christians in prison, and burying them when they\r\nwere put to death; a course of life that resulted in a glorious\r\nmartyrdom. In honour of these two faithful women was built one of the\r\nfirst churches of Rome, consecrated, it is said, as early as 141, and\r\nstill existing in all the glory of its ancient mosaics. Santa Prassede,\r\nas modern Rome terms it, gives title to a cardinal; and the admirable\r\nCarlo Borromeo was thus distinguished, deserving, perhaps, more than any\r\nother known ‘hinge-priest’ of Rome to be called after the saint of holy\r\nactivity. Prassede has continued in vogue among Italian women, who\r\nfrequently learn their names from Roman churches. I have found Plaxy in\r\nCornwall, possibly from this source. Here, too, we should place Anysia\r\n(Ἀνύσια), from ἀνύω (anuo), to accomplish or complete. She was a maiden\r\nof Thessalonica, put to death there under Maximian. Her day is the 30th\r\nof October, in the Greek calendar, and Annusia is a Russian name, but\r\nshe is not in the Roman calendar; and how the Normans heard of her it is\r\nhard to guess, unless it was either from the Sicilian Greeks, or in the\r\nCrusades; nevertheless, we are often met by Annys, Anisia, Annice, or\r\nAnnes, in older pedigrees. The latter form occurs down to 1597 in the\r\nregisters of the county of Durham. In later times the form was absorbed\r\nby Anne.\r\n\r\nΤροφή, Trophe (food or nourishment), formed Τρόφιμος, Trophimos (the\r\nfruitful or nourishing), the name of an old Greek sculptor, and\r\nafterwards of the Ephesian companion of St. Paul who was left sick at\r\nMiletus. The people at Arles consider that he afterwards preached the\r\nGospel in their city, and have made him the patron of their cathedral;\r\nbut it is Russia that continues the use of his name as Trofeem.[38]\r\n\r\nEven among the heathen Greeks, Τρυφή, Tryphe (daintiness, softness, or\r\ndelicacy), had not a respectable signification. Yet Τρύφον, or Tryphon,\r\nwas a favourite with persons of inferior rank—artists, architects, and\r\nphysicians; and in the Decian persecution, a martyr so called was put to\r\nthe extremity of torture in Bithynia, and has remained highly honoured\r\nin the calendar of the Greek Church; Trypho continuing in use as a\r\nRussian name.\r\n\r\nThe feminine form, Τρυφαίνα (Tryphæna), was given to two of the\r\ndaughters of the Ptolemys in Egypt, where it was far from inappropriate;\r\nbut, probably, the two women whom St. Paul greets so honourably at Rome\r\nas Tryphæna and Tryphosa, were either Alexandrian Jewesses whom he had\r\nmet at Corinth on their way to Rome, or else merely so called as being\r\nthe daughters of some Tryphon. They were not canonized, and the dainty\r\nTryphæna has only been revived in England by the Puritan taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SECTION IX.—_Names connected with the Constitution.—Laos, &c._\r\n\r\nThe democratic Greeks delighted in names connected with their public\r\ninstitutions—ἀγορά (agora), the assembly, δῆμος (dêmos), the public,\r\nλαός, also the people, gave them numerous names, with which were closely\r\nconnected the formations from δίκη (dike), justice, and κλέος (kleos),\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nΛαοδάμας (Laodamas), people-tamer, had a feminine Λαοδάμεια (Laodameia),\r\nprincipally noted for the beautiful legend of her bitter grief for her\r\nhusband, the first to fall at Troy, having recalled him to earth for\r\nthree hours under the charge of Hermes. Probably Florence must have had\r\na local saint named Laodamia, for it has continued in vogue there.\r\n\r\nThe demos better answered to the commons; they expressed less the\r\ngeneral populace than the whole voting class of free citizens, and were\r\nmore select. We find them often at the beginning or end of Greek names,\r\nlike the Theut of the Teutons: Demodokos, people’s teacher; Demoleon,\r\npeople’s lion; Nikodemos, conquering people, etc.\r\n\r\nΚλέος (Kleos), fame, from κλείω (kleio), to call, had as many\r\nderivatives as the Frank _hlod_, or loud, for renowned, but most of them\r\nhave passed out of use, though Κλεάνθης (Kleanthes), famous bloom, the\r\nname of a celebrated sculptor, so struck the fancy of the French that\r\nCleanthe—their epicene form—was one of the favourite soubriquets for\r\ntheir portraits of living characters. Even Cleopatra (Κλεοπάτρα), fame\r\nof her father, with all her beauty and fame, did not hand on the name\r\nwhich she had received in common with a long course of daughters of\r\nEgypto-Greek kings. Russia alone accepts it as a frequent Christian\r\nname, and it is occasionally to be found in England and America.\r\n\r\nThe wreath of the conqueror was an appropriate allusion to those games\r\nwhere the Greek youth delighted to contend, and very probably the first\r\nStephanos (Στέφανος) was so called by an exulting family whose father\r\nhad returned with the parsley, or pine-leaf, crown upon his brow, and\r\nnamed the infant in honour of the victory. For Stephanos was an old\r\nGreek name, which had belonged among others to a son of Thucydides,\r\nbefore it came to that Hellenist deacon who first of all achieved the\r\ngreatest of all the victories, and won the crown.\r\n\r\nBesides St. Stephen’s own day, another on the 3rd of August for “the\r\ninvention of St. Stephen’s relics,” which were pointed out in a dream to\r\na priest of Caphargamala in the year 415, by no less a person than the\r\nJewish doctor, Gamaliel, in a white robe, covered with plates of gold.\r\nThe bones were carried to the church on Mount Sion, and thence dispersed\r\ninto all quarters; even St. Augustin rejoiced in receiving a portion at\r\nHippo, other fragments were taken to the Balearic Isles, while Ancona\r\nlaid claim to the possession of a bone, carried off at the time of the\r\nsaint’s martyrdom!\r\n\r\nNo wonder the name is common. Seven saints bore it besides the\r\nproto-martyr, and among them, that admirable King of Hungary, who\r\nendeared it to his people, and left the crown so highly honoured at\r\nPrague. Our name of Stephen is probably due to the acquaintance of the\r\nNormans with Ancona, whence William the Conqueror obtained such interest\r\nin St. Stephen as to dedicate to him the Abbey built at Caen. There is\r\nno instance of the name in Domesday Book, and our king of turbulent\r\nmemory derived it from his father, the Count de Blois. In the roll of\r\nWinchester householders in Stephen’s reign we find, however, already\r\nStephen de Crickeled and “Stephen the Saracen.” Could this last have\r\nbeen a convert brought home from the East, and baptized in honour of the\r\npious Count de Blois, father of the king—perhaps an adherent of the\r\nfamily? It is everywhere in use, varied according to the manner in which\r\nthe tongue treated the double consonant. The feminine began at Cambrai\r\nat least as early as the thirteenth century, and it is frequent in Caen,\r\nprobably in honour of St. Stephen’s Abbey at Caen.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    German.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Stephen        │Stephan        │Etienne        │Stefano        │\r\n   │               │Steffel        │Tiennon        │Steffano       │\r\n   │               │               │Tiennot        │               │\r\n   │               │               │Estevennes     │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │    Dutch.     │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Estevan        │Estevao        │Steven         │Stefan         │\r\n   │Esteban        │               │               │Stepan         │\r\n   │               │               │               │Stenka         │\r\n   │               │               │               │Stepka         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Illyrian.   │  Esthonian.   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Sscezepan      │Stepan         │Tewa           │Istvan         │\r\n   │   —————————   │Stepo          │               │               │\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │Stepko         │               │               │\r\n   │Scezpan        │Stepika        │               │               │\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Portuguese.  │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Stephan        │Estephanie     │Estephania     │Stefanida      │\r\n   │               │Stefanie       │               │————————       │\r\n   │               │Etiennette     │               │    German.    │\r\n   │               │Tiennette      │               │Stephanine     │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nI venture here to include the numerous names of which the leading word\r\nis Ὀλυμπ. They are generally derived from Mount Olympos, the habitation\r\nof the gods; but I cannot help thinking them more likely to be connected\r\nwith the Olympian games, and to have been first invented for children\r\nborn in the year of an Olympiad.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous varieties, but none have survived except the\r\nfeminine Olympias, belonging to the proud but much beloved mother of\r\nAlexander, and, like all other Macedonian names, spreading through the\r\nEast. A Byzantine widow, of great piety and charity, who stood faithful\r\nto St. Chrysostom during his persecution by the empress, was canonized,\r\nand sent Olympias on to be a favourite with the Greeks, so that it\r\nflourishes among all ranks in the Ionian Islands. Italy had her Olimpia,\r\nprobably through the Greek connections of Venice; and the noble and\r\nlearned Olimpia Morata rendered it famous. It was brought to France by\r\nthe niece of Mazarin, the Comtesse de Soissons, of evil fame as a\r\npoisoner, and yet the mother of Prince Eugène. From her, apparently,\r\nOlympe spread among French ladies and long continued fashionable, and\r\nSurtee’s _History of the County Palatine of Durham_ mentions an Olympia\r\nWray, married in 1660.\r\n\r\nHere, too, must be mentioned Milone, though its connection with the\r\nsubject is only through Milon, the famous Greek wrestler of Crotona, who\r\ncarried a heifer through the Stadium at Olympia, and afterwards ate her\r\nup in a single meal; killed a bull with one stroke of his fist; and\r\nfinally, was caught by the hands in the recoil of a riven oak, and there\r\nimprisoned till eaten by the wolves. Michaelis thinks the root of the\r\nword is the same with that of the old German verb _milan_, to beat or\r\ncrush, the relation of our _mills_. Thence may likewise have come the\r\nLatin _Miles_, and the Keltic _Milidh_, both meaning a warrior.\r\n\r\nMilo belonged to the realms of romance. In the story of the Golden Ass\r\nof Apuleius, Milon is the master of the house where the unfortunate hero\r\nundergoes his transformation; and having thus entered the world of\r\nimagination, Milon, or Milone as Italian poets call him, became a\r\npaladin of Charlemagne; Milan was a Welsh knight in one of Marie of\r\nBretagne’s lays; and in a curious old French romance, Miles is the\r\nfather of two children, one of whom is brought up by a lion, and\r\ndefended by an ape as his champion. These stories, or their germs, must\r\nhave struck the Norman fancy, for a Milo appears among the newly\r\ninstalled landholders in Domesday Book, and Milo Fitzwilliam stands\r\nearly in the Essex pedigrees, but very soon the vernacular form became\r\nMiles. Among the Norman settlers in Ireland, Miles was a frequent name;\r\nand in the Stanton family, when it had become so thoroughly Hibernicized\r\nas to dislike the Norman appellation, one branch assumed the surname of\r\nMacAveely, son of Milo, according to the change of pronunciation\r\nundergone by Erse consonants in the genitive. Miles or Myles itself was\r\nadopted as an English equivalent for the native Erse Maelmordha, or\r\nmajestic chief, and has now become almost an exclusively Irish name,\r\nthough sometimes used in England by inheritance from Norman ancestors,\r\nand generally incorrectly derived from the Latin _Miles_, whereas its\r\nimmediate parent is certainly the Greek Milo.[39]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Surius; Sir Cuthbert Sharpe, _Extracts from Parish Registers_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Butler; Neale, _Hymns of the Greek Church_; Smith;\r\n  Dunlop, _History of Fiction_; Hanmer, _Chronicle of Ireland_;\r\n  _Publications of Irish and Ossianic Societies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTIAN GREEK NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I.\r\n\r\nThe names that we place in this class are such as arose under the\r\nChristian dispensation. Some, indeed, are older, and many more may be\r\nso, and may have been in use among slaves, peasants, and persons of whom\r\nhistory took no cognizance; but the great mass, even if previously\r\ninvented, were given with a religious meaning and adaptation, and many\r\nembodied ideas that no heathen could have devised. Greek, above all\r\nothers the ecclesiastical tongue, has sent forth more widely diffused\r\nnames of truly Christian meaning than any other language; the formations\r\nof Latin, German, and English, in imitation of these are, in comparison,\r\ninharmonious and ungainly, carrying their meaning too openly displayed.\r\n\r\nAmong these are here mixed, when they belong evidently to the same race,\r\nthe exclusively modern Greek names, which have arisen since Greece and\r\nher dependencies ceased to be the great store-house of martyrs and\r\nsaints, and the dispenser of sacred thought to the Christian world.\r\nMany, indeed, of these names may be of equally ancient date, only not\r\nbelonging to any individual of sufficient renown to have transmitted\r\nthem to other countries.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no land has been less beholden to others in her nomenclature\r\nthan modern Greece. Hebrew names have, indeed, come in through her\r\nreligion; a very few were accepted from the Latin in the days when\r\nConstantinople was the seat of the Roman empire, and when the churches\r\nwere one; but scarcely one of the wide-spread ‘Frank’ names has ever\r\nbeen adopted by the Greeks. Even in Slavonic Russia the nomenclature\r\nremains almost exclusively Byzantine; the native Slave names are\r\ncomparatively few, and those that come in from other nations are\r\ndiscarded, as at Constantinople, for some supposed Greek equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION II.—_Names from Theos._\r\n\r\nAlready in speaking of Zeus it has been explained that this and Θεός\r\n(Theos) are but differing forms of the same term for Divinity, although\r\none became restricted to the individual Deity; the other was a generic\r\nterm in heathen days, retaining, however, so much of spiritual majesty\r\nthat it was employed in the Septuagint to express the true Creator, and\r\nthus Christians embraced it as the designation of the supreme object of\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nThe word Theos itself had been assumed as a surname by one of the worst\r\nof the line of the Syrian Antiochus, and Theon had never been infrequent\r\namong the Greeks. Θεόφιλος (Theophilos), God-beloved, to whom is\r\ndedicated the Gospel of St. Luke, must have been so called before his\r\nChristianity. Thenceforward Theophilus became a name in the Church; but\r\nit has been less used on the Continent than in England. There, probably\r\nfrom its occurrence in Holy Scripture, and also from being generally the\r\ntitle of the favourite speaker in religious dialogues, it has been in\r\nsome use. The feminine, Theophila, was the name of the mother of Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Italian and  │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │               │               │   Spanish.    │               │\r\n   │Theophilus     │Théophile      │Teofilo        │Theophilo      │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nTheokles (Θέοκλής), divine fame, was an ancient heathen name, and it is\r\nmost probable that Θεκλα (Thekla) is the contraction of the feminine.\r\nSt. Thekla was said to have been a disciple of St. Paul, at Inconium,\r\nand to have been exposed to lions at Antioch. Though they crouched at\r\nher feet instead of tearing her, she is considered as the first virgin\r\nmartyr, and it was deemed that the highest possible praise for a woman\r\nwas to compare her to St. Thekla. Another Thekla of Alexandria is\r\nbelieved to have been the scribe of that precious copy of the Gospels\r\ngiven by Cyril Lucar to Charles I., and now in the British Museum; and\r\nthus Thekla has always had high reputation in the East, though less\r\nknown in the West, except that ‘Tecla’ is the patroness of Tarragona.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    German.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    Russian    │\r\n   │Thekla         │Técla          │Tecla          │Tjokle         │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nΘεόδορος (Theodoros), and Θεόδορα (Theodora), divine gift, are the most\r\nusual of these names; the first universal in the East and West, the\r\nsecond prevalent in the Eastern Church, but less common in the Western\r\nthan the incorrect feminine Dorothea.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous saints called Theodorus; the favourite of the West\r\nbeing he of Heraclea, a young soldier, who burnt the temple of Cybele,\r\nand was martyred in consequence. The Venetians brought home his legend,\r\nand made him their champion and one of their patron saints, whence\r\nTeodoro has prevailed in the city of the Doge; and from a church\r\ndedicated to him at Rome the Spaniards must have taken their Teodor, the\r\nFrench their Théodore, and the Germans the similar Theodor, which has\r\nalways been frequent there.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Britons must have known and used this name; for among their\r\nhost of obscure saints of princely birth appears Tewdwr; and the Welsh\r\nmade so much use of this form that when the handsome Owen ap Tewdwr won\r\nthe heart of the widow of Harry of Monmouth, Tudor was an acknowledged\r\nsurname, and in two generations more it became a royal one.\r\n\r\nHere, however, the Theodores are a recent introduction. They seem only\r\nto have been really hereditary in Wales, Greece, and Venice. By Greece\r\nis also meant all those Greco-Slavonic countries that received their\r\nnomenclature from Constantinople, in especial Russia, where the _th_ is\r\nexchanged for _ph_, so as to produce the word Feodor; and the Germans,\r\nreceiving it again, spell it Pheodor.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    Welsh.     │    French.    │  Portuguese.  │    Spanish    │\r\n   │Tewdwr         │Théodore       │Theodoro       │  and Italian. │\r\n   │    ———————    │               │               │Teodoro        │\r\n   │   English.    │               │               │               │\r\n   │Theodore       │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Hamburg.    │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Theodor        │Tedor          │Feodor         │Feodor         │\r\n   │Pheodor        │Tetje          │Fedor          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Slavonic.   │   Illyrian.   │     Lett.     │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Todor          │Todor          │Kodders        │Twador         │\r\n   │               │Toso           │Kwedders       │   —————————   │\r\n   │               │               │               │   Finland.    │\r\n   │               │               │               │Theotari       │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe feminine Theodora has two independent saints, a martyr and a Greek\r\nempress. It suffers no alterations except the Russian _F_ at the\r\ncommencement, and is not common except in the East. The West prefers the\r\nname reversed, and rendered incorrect. Dorotheus and Theodorus may\r\nindeed be exact equivalents; but the invention of Theodora makes the\r\ngiver feminine instead of the gift. It is the beauty of the legend of\r\nSt. Dorothea that has made her name so great a favourite. Never did\r\npious fancy form a more beautiful dream than the story of the\r\nCappadocian maiden, who sent the roses of paradise by angelic hands as a\r\nconvincing testimony of the joy that she was reaping. The tale is of\r\nwestern growth, and the chief centre of St. Dorothea’s popularity as a\r\npatroness was in Germany; but the name was likewise in great favour in\r\nEngland, where Massinger composed a drama on her story. Dorothy was once\r\none of the most usual of English names; and ‘Dolly’ was so constantly\r\nheard in every household, that it finally became the generic term for\r\nthe wooden children that at least as late as the infancy of Elizabeth\r\nStuart, were called babies or puppets. In the days of affectation, under\r\nthe House of Hanover, Dorothy fell into disuse, but was regarded as of\r\nthe same old Puritan character as Abigail or Tabitha. Probably from the\r\ninfluence of German literature, the German contraction Dora, or more\r\nproperly Dore, has come in as almost an independent name, which,\r\nperhaps, ought to be translated as simply a gift, though often used as a\r\ncontraction for Dorothea. The fashion has again come round, and Dorothy\r\nhas become the favourite name. In the last century, Dorinda was a\r\nfashionable English fancy embellishment, Doralice a French one—perhaps\r\nfrom the German Dorlisa—Dorothea Elisa. The Russian Darija is reckoned\r\nas a translation; but it does not seem probable, for the patroness of\r\nthis latter was an Athenian lady, martyred with her husband,\r\nChrysanthus, at Rome, and buried in a catacomb, which was opened in the\r\ndays of Constantine the Great. The modern Greeks call the name,\r\nThorothea.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │\r\n   │Dorothea       │Dorothée       │Dorothea       │Derede         │\r\n   │Dorothy        │Dorette        │Dore           │Duredel        │\r\n   │Dolly          │Doralice       │Dorlisa        │Durl           │\r\n   │Dora           │Dorothea       │               │               │\r\n   │Dorinda        │Dore           │               │               │\r\n   │               │Dorlisa        │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Swiss.     │    Dutch.     │    Danish.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Torli          │Dört           │Daarte         │Dorotea        │\r\n   │               │Dortchen       │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │   Italian.    │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Dorothe        │Dorotea        │Dorofei        │Dorota         │\r\n   │               │               │Darija         │Dorosia        │\r\n   │               │               │Darha          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Daschenka      │               │\r\n   │               │               │Dorka          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Illyrian.   │   Lusatian.   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │\r\n   │Doroteja       │Dora           │Darte          │Tigo           │\r\n   │Dora           │Horta          │Tike           │Tio            │\r\n   │Rotija         │Horteja        │Tiga           │               │\r\n   │Horta          │Vortija        │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Lithuanian.  │     Ung.      │               │               │\r\n   │Urte           │Doroltya       │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the word _doros_, we may mention the name Isidoros, a\r\nvery old and frequent one among the ancient Greeks, and explained by\r\nsome to mean Gift of Isis; but this Egyptian deity is an improbable\r\norigin for a name certainly in use before the Greek kingdom in Egypt was\r\nestablished, and it seems more satisfactory to refer the first syllable\r\nto ἰς (strength), a word which when it had its digamma was Γις, exactly\r\nanswering to the Latin _vis_ (force or strength). It commenced many old\r\nGreek names, but none that have passed on to Christian times except\r\nIsidorus, which was first borne by one of the grim hermits of Egypt,\r\nthen by an Alexandrian author, and then by three Spanish bishops of\r\nCordova, Seville, and Badajos. They probably received it as a\r\nresemblance of the Gothic names beginning with _eisen_ (iron). In\r\nconsequence, Isidoro and the feminine Isidora have continued national in\r\nSpain, and Isodoros in Greece, whence Russia has taken Eesidor.\r\n\r\nTheodotos (God-given) was in common use among the Greeks of the early\r\nempire, and apparently in Spain was corrupted into Theodosius, since\r\nSpain was the native land of him who rendered this form illustrious.\r\nTheodosia has been in favour in many parts of Europe, copied probably\r\nfrom some of the Byzantine princesses. The canonized personages of the\r\nmasculine and feminine forms are, however, by no means imperial; the one\r\nbeing a hermit, the other a virgin martyr. Theone is also a German\r\nfeminine.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │               │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Theodosius     │               │Théodose       │Teodosia       │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │   Italian.    │   Russian.    │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Theodosia      │Teodosia       │Feodosia       │Desse          │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe entire race of Greek words thus derived must be carefully\r\ndistinguished from the Gothic ones, which at first sight appear to\r\nresemble them: such as Theodoric, Theudebert, &c., but are all, in fact,\r\ntaken from the Teuton word _Theut_ (the people).\r\n\r\nOf Theophanos we shall speak among the names taken from sacred\r\nfestivals, but we must not leave these titles of pious signification\r\nwithout mentioning Τιμόθεος (honour God), from τιμὴ (honour or worship),\r\nthe noun formed from τίω (to honour or esteem), connected of course with\r\nthe Latin _timor_ (fear).\r\n\r\nTimotheus had been in use even in heathen times, as in the case of\r\nAlexander’s musician.\r\n\r\nBut probably it was with a full religious meaning that the good Eunice\r\nchose it for that son who was to be the disciple of St. Paul and the\r\nfirst bishop of Ephesus. From him, and from several subsequent Saints,\r\nthe East and West both learnt it, but at the present day it flourishes\r\nchiefly in Russia as Teemofe. In Ireland, it was taken as one of the\r\nequivalents of the native Tadgh (a bard), and the absurdities of Irish\r\nTims have cast a ridiculous air over it, mingled with the Puritan odour\r\nof the Cromwellian days, such as to lower it from the estimation its\r\nassociations deserve. Mr. Timothy Davison, in 1670, named his daughter\r\nTimothea, but happily his example does not seem to have been\r\nfollowed.[40]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Timothy        │Timothée       │Timoteo        │Timofei        │\r\n   │Tim            │               │               │Timoscha       │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Slavonic.   │     Lett.     │               │\r\n   │Tymotensz      │Timoty         │Tots           │               │\r\n   │Timoty         │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Jameson; Butler; Liddell and Scott; Hartwell Horne,\r\n  _Introduction to the Bible_; Le Beau, _Bas Empire_; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION III.—_Names from Christos._\r\n\r\nThe Greek verb χρίω (chrio), to touch, rub, or anoint, formed the term\r\nΧριστός, which translated the old Hebrew prophetic Messiah (the\r\nAnointed), and thence became the title of the Saviour, the very\r\ntouch-stone of faith.\r\n\r\nTherefore it was that at Antioch the disciples came to be called\r\nΧρίστιανοι (Christianoi), a Greek word with a Latin termination, the\r\ntitle that they accepted as their highest glory, and which has ever\r\nsince been the universal and precious designation of a believer. The\r\nfirst person who is known to have been baptized after this title, was\r\nSt. Christina, a Roman virgin of patrician birth, who was martyred in\r\n295. Her marvellous legend declares that she was thrown into lake\r\nBolsena, with a mill-stone round her neck, but that she floated to the\r\nsurface, supported by angels, and that she was at last shot to death\r\nwith arrows. She is therefore, of course, patroness of Bolsena and of\r\nthe Venetian States, where Cristina is frequent; and her fame travelled\r\nto Greece, Bohemia, and Hungary, from which last place the Atheling\r\nfamily brought it to England and Scotland in the person of Christina,\r\nAbbess of Romsey. Christian, like the other Greek names of this\r\nimportation, took deep root in Scotland, where Kirstin is its\r\nabbreviation among the peasantry; and Christina, or Stine, and Tine, is\r\ncommon in Germany. John Bunyan’s Christiana, as the feminine of his\r\nallegorical Christian, has made this form the most common in England.\r\nChristine, either through Germany or Scotland, found its way to\r\nScandinavia, where the contraction is Kirste, or Kirstine. Being\r\nvigorous name-makers at the time of their conversion, the Northmen were\r\nnot content to leave this as a mere lady’s name inherited from the\r\nsaint, but invented for themselves a masculine Christian, or Christiern\r\nas they call it in Denmark, which has belonged to many a sovereign in\r\nthat kingdom, where it is especially national, and contracts into\r\nKirsten.\r\n\r\nChristabel was already a name before Coleridge’s time. It is to be found\r\nin Cornwall, in 1727, and in the North of England. It occurs at Crayke,\r\nin Yorkshire, between 1538 and 1652.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    German.    │    French.    │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Christian      │Christian      │Chrestien      │Kristian       │\r\n   │               │               │Chrétien       │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Danish.    │ Netherlands.  │   Dantzig.    │   Frisian.    │\r\n   │Christian      │Kerstan        │Zan            │Tsassen        │\r\n   │               │Karston        │    ——————     │Tziasso        │\r\n   │               │Krischân       │    Dutch.     │Zasso          │\r\n   │               │Kruschan       │Korstiaan      │Sasze          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Swiss.     │    Polish.    │   Slavonic.   │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Krista         │Krystyan       │Kristijan      │Kristian       │\r\n   │Chresta        │               │               │Kersto         │\r\n   │Chresteli      │               │               │Hristo         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │  Bulgarian.   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │\r\n   │Khrystjan      │Krustjo        │Kristo         │Kersti         │\r\n   │Kristo         │               │Skersto        │    ——————     │\r\n   │Kito           │               │               │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │               │               │               │Kerestel       │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │  Bulgarian.   │\r\n   │Christiana     │Christine      │Christiane     │Khrustina      │\r\n   │Christian      │               │Christine      │    ——————     │\r\n   │Christina      │               │Stine          │  Lithuanian.  │\r\n   │Chrissie       │               │Tine           │Krikszte       │\r\n   │Xina           │               │Kristel        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Christinha     │Cristine       │Cristina       │Karstin        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Slavonic.   │   Lusatian.   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │\r\n   │Kristina       │Krystla        │Kristine       │Kirstin        │\r\n   │Kina           │Kita           │Kersti         │Kirste         │\r\n   │               │Kitka          │Skersten       │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nFrom the same holy title was derived that of Χριστοφόρος\r\n(Christ-bearer), claimed by many an early Christian as an expression of\r\nhis membership, as St. Ignatius on his trial spoke of himself as\r\nΘεοφορος. To this title was attached the beautiful allegory of the giant\r\never in search of the strongest master, whom he found at last in the\r\nlittle child that he bore on his shoulders over the river. Simplicity\r\nsoon turned the parable into credited fact, and St. Christopher became\r\nthe object of the most eager veneration, especially as there had been a\r\nreal martyr so called, and mentioned in the Mozarabic service-book. He\r\nwas put to death in Lycia, and his relics were supposed to have been at\r\nfirst at Toledo and afterwards at St. Denis. The sight of St.\r\nChristopher’s image was thought to be a protection from sickness,\r\nearthquake, fire, or flood, for the rest of the day, and it was\r\ntherefore carved out and painted in huge proportions outside churches\r\nand houses, especially in Italy, Spain, and Germany. The cumbrous length\r\nis cut down in England into Kit, Kester, and Chris. The modern Greeks\r\nshorten Christophoros into Christachi. The two feminine are the German\r\nChristophine and English Christophera.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    French.    │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Christopher    │Christopher    │Christophe     │Kristofer      │\r\n   │Kester         │Christal       │               │Kristofel      │\r\n   │Kit            │               │               │               │\r\n   │Chris          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │ Netherlands.  │    German.    │    Swiss.     │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Toffel         │Christoph      │Chrestoffel    │Cristoforo     │\r\n   │Toff           │Stoffel        │Stoffel        │Cristovano     │\r\n   │               │Stoppel        │               │Gristovalo     │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │   Spanish.    │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Christovao     │Cristoval      │Christofer     │Kristof        │\r\n   │               │               │Christof       │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │     Lett.     │  Lithuanian.  │               │\r\n   │Kitto          │Kristoppis     │Kristuppas     │               │\r\n   │               │Kristagis      │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nChristopher was once far more common in England than it is at present.\r\nIn the list of voters at Durham in the year 1500, there were thirteen\r\nChristophers, and in 1813 there were as many as ten.

It was called,\r\nand it has borne the title through its four hundred years of bondage to\r\nIslam, Sta. Sophia (the holy wisdom of God), that figurative wisdom whom\r\nChristians considered the Book of Proverbs to point out as the Word of\r\nGod. Moreover, the words of the ‘Preacher,’ in the Book of\r\nEcclesiasticus, “Wisdom (Σοφία) is the mother of fair Love and Hope and\r\nholy Fear,” suggested an allegory of a holy woman with three daughters\r\nso called, and thus, in compliment, no doubt, to the glorious\r\nnewly-built church, the niece of Justinian’s empress, afterwards wife to\r\nhis nephew and successor, was called Sophia, a name which thenceforward\r\nbecame the fashion among the purple-born daughters, and spread from them\r\namong the Slavonian nations, who regarded Constantinople as the centre\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nThrough these Slavonians Sophia spread to Germany. A Hungarian princess\r\nwas so called in 999; another, the daughter of King Geysa, married\r\nMagnus of Saxony, in 1074, and Saxony scattered its Sophias in the next\r\ncenturies all over the neighbouring states and into Denmark, where it\r\nhas always been a royal name. Very nearly had the Electress Sophia\r\nbrought it to our throne, and though the unhappy Sophia Dorothea of\r\nZelle never took her place in the English Court, her grand-daughters\r\nmade it one of the most fashionable ladies' names under the House of\r\nHanover; and though its reign has passed with the taste for ornamental\r\nnomenclature, yet the soft and easy sound of Sophy still makes her hold\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  German.   │  Danish.   │  Frisian.  │\r\n   │Sophia      │Sophie      │Sophia      │Saffi       │Vye         │\r\n   │Sophy       │            │Fieke       │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Italian.  │  Russian.  │  Polish.   │   Lett.    │ Hungarian. │\r\n   │Sofia       │Ssofija     │Zofia       │Sappe       │Zsofia      │\r\n   │            │Ssonia      │Zosia       │Wike        │Zsofe       │\r\n   │            │Ssoniuska   │            │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION V.—_Petros._\r\n\r\nGreat is the controversy that hangs on the form of Πέτρος, the surname\r\ndivinely bestowed upon the faithful disciple Simon Barjona, when he made\r\nhis great confession of faith in the Godhead and Messiahship of his\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\n“Thou art _Petros_ (a stone), and on this _Petra_ (a rock) I will build\r\nmy Church,” are the words.\r\n\r\nThe apostle was sometimes called in his own lifetime by the Hebrew or\r\nSyriac equivalent Κηφᾶς, or Cephas; but Petros, or Petrus, being both\r\nGreek and Latin words, he went down to posterity thus distinguished.\r\nMany a Pietro was called after him in Italy, to be cut down into Piero\r\nor Pier, and amplified into Pietruccio, or Petruccio and Petraccio. The\r\ndevout Spaniards caught up the name, and had many a Pedro, nay, three\r\nPedros at once were reigning at a time in three Peninsular kingdoms, and\r\nthe frequency of Perez as a surname shows how full Spain is of the sons\r\nof Pedro. France had many a Pierre, Pierrot, or, in Brittany, Perronnik.\r\nPerrault, a common surname, may be a derivation from it, as is St.\r\nPierre, one of the territorial designations. Before the Revolution, La\r\nPierre and La France were the unvarying designations of the two lackeys\r\nthat every family of any pretension always kept in those days of\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nEngland had Peter, which Peter-pence, perhaps, hindered from being a\r\nfavourite, and borrowed from the French, Piers and Pierce. Feories is\r\nthe Irish version of Pierce. Pedder or Peer are both much used in the\r\nNorth, and Peter in Germany; while the great Muscovite made Petr notable\r\nin his empire. The Irish, regardless of the true history of Patricius,\r\nwant to make St. Patrick a namesake of St. Peter, and therefore the\r\nPaddys own not only their national apostle, but the prince of apostles,\r\nfor their patrons. The feminines of Peter are Petronilla, said to have\r\nbeen his daughter, and whence has come Petronilla in Spanish, Petronille\r\nshortened into Nille in Norway, Pernel or Parnel, once exceeding common,\r\nthough now forgotten, in England; but other female names have been made\r\ndirect from that of the saint, Peronetta in Italy, Perretta in France,\r\nand even Petrina in Scotland and Sweden.\r\n\r\n  ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────────┐\r\n  │   English.    │    French.    │   Swedish.    │     Danish.     │\r\n  │Peter          │Pierre         │Per            │Peder            │\r\n  │Piers          │Pierrot        │               │                 │\r\n  │Pierce         │Perrin         │               │                 │\r\n  │               │Peire          │               │                 │\r\n  ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n  │    Dutch.     │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │   Portuguese.   │\r\n  │Pieter         │Pietro         │Pedro          │Pedro            │\r\n  │Piet           │Piero          │               │Pedrinho         │\r\n  │               │Pier           │               │                 │\r\n  │               │Pietruccio     │               │                 │\r\n  ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n  │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Illyrian.   │    Lusatian.    │\r\n  │Petr           │Picti          │Petai          │Pjeti            │\r\n  │Petruscha      │Pies           │Pero           │Petsch           │\r\n  │Petrinka       │               │Petrica        │Peto             │\r\n  │               │               │Pejo           │                 │\r\n  ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n  │  Bulgarian.   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │      Kelt.      │\r\n  │Petur          │Peteris        │Pedo           │Pétar  } _Erse_  │\r\n  │Petko          │               │Pet            │Feoris }         │\r\n  │               │               │               │                 │\r\n  │               │               │               │Per    } _Breton_│\r\n  │               │               │               │Petrik }         │\r\n  ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────┤\r\n  │                            FEMININE.                            │\r\n  ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────────┤\r\n  │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Portuguese.   │\r\n  │Petrina        │Perette        │Petronilla     │Petronilha       │\r\n  │Petronella     │Petronelle     │ ————————————  │  ————————————   │\r\n  │Pernel         │Petrine        │    German.    │    llyrian.     │\r\n  │               │               │Petronille     │Petra            │\r\n  │               │               │Nelle          │Petrija          │\r\n  │               │               │Nillel         │Petrusa          │\r\n  └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION VI.—_Names of Immortality._\r\n\r\nRejoicing that “life and immortality had been brought to light” quickly\r\nbroke out in the very names given to Christians at their baptism, and\r\nfull of import were the appellations invented in these early ages of the\r\nChurch, to express the joyful hope of everlasting life.\r\n\r\nEven in the Sanscrit, _a-mrita_ expresses the elixir of life, “the\r\namreeta cup of immortality,” which terminates the woes of Kailyal in the\r\n_Curse of Kehama_, and according to Hindoo myth was produced by the\r\ncelebrated churning of the ocean. The name is traced to _a_ privative\r\nand _mri_, a word to be met with again in _mors_, _murder_, &c., and the\r\nnotion of a water of life continued to pervade all the Indo-European\r\nraces. Among the Greeks this life-giving elixir was ἀμβροσία (ambrosia),\r\nimmediately derived from ἄμβροτος (immortal), a word from the same\r\nsource. In various legends this ambrosia served to express the human\r\ncraving for heavenly and immortal food, until at length, in later times,\r\nambrosia came to be regarded as the substantial meat of the gods, as\r\nnectar was their drink.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Christianity to proclaim the true ambrosia, the\r\nveritable food of Paradise, and thus it was that Ambrosios became a\r\nchosen name, borne in especial by that great Archbishop of Milan, who\r\nspent one of the most illustrious lives recorded in Church history. The\r\nChurch has never forgotten this great saint; and Milan, where his own\r\nliturgy has never been discontinued, is especially devoted to her Sant'\r\nAmbrogio, but his history is perhaps a little too much in the clear\r\nlight of day to afford the convenient shadow requisite for\r\nname-spreading legend, and his name has but moderate popularity.\r\nAlready, as we may suppose, his fame had spread to Britain when Aurelius\r\nAmbrosius, the brave champion who so long withstood the Saxon invaders,\r\nbore it and left it to the Welsh as Emrys.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Spanish.  │  Russian.  │\r\n   │Ambrose     │Ambroise    │Ambrogio    │Ambrosio    │Amvrossij   │\r\n   │Brush       │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Polish.   │ Bohemian.  │ Lusatian.  │ Hungarian. │   Welsh.   │\r\n   │Ambrozij    │Ambroz      │’Bros       │Ambrus      │Emrys       │\r\n   │            │            │Mros        │            │            │\r\n   │            │            │Brosk       │            │            │\r\n   │            │            │Mrosk       │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit was formed Ἀθανασίος (Athanasios), from the word\r\nθάνατος (death). The Undying was in itself a name of good hope for a\r\nChristian, and it became dear to the Church at large through the great\r\nAlexandrian patriarch, the bulwark of the faith. It is in the East that\r\nhis name has been kept up; the West, though of course knowing it and\r\nusing it for him individually, shows few namesakes except in Italy,\r\nwhere it is probably a remnant of the Greek influence upon Venice and\r\nNaples. The feminine Atanasia is, I believe, solely Italian.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Russian.    │   Servian.    │\r\n   │Athanase       │Atanasio       │Afanassij      │Atanacko       │\r\n   │               │Atanagio       │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nSo again the new Christians took the old word ἀνάστασις (meaning an\r\nawakening or raising), from ἀνίστημι (to make to stand up), and used it\r\nto signify the Resurrection; then formed from Ἀναστάσιος (Anastasios),\r\nof the Resurrection,—having the elements of the Resurrection within him\r\nor her, for the feminine Anastasia was as early and as frequent as the\r\nmasculine. Indeed the strange caprices of fate have decreed that, though\r\nthe masculine form is exceedingly common all over the Eastern Church, it\r\nshould, in spite of three saints in the calendar, one of papal dignity,\r\nbe almost unused in the West, except in Bavaria, whilst the feminine,\r\nborne by two virgin martyrs, is prevalent everywhere, and chiefly in\r\nIreland. England once used the name more than at present, and then\r\nAnglicized it into Anstace. Anstiss, Anstish, Anstyce, all occur\r\nfrequently as _female_ names in the elder pages of a Devonshire parish\r\nregister, where Anstice is now a surname. Anstis Squire is in the\r\nFroxfield register in 1587, and the name must once have been much more\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    French.    │   Italian.    │    Polish.    │   Bavarian.   │\r\n   │Anastase       │Anastagio      │Anastazij      │Anastasl       │\r\n   │               │               │               │Stas           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Stasl          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Stasi          │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    Irish.     │    French.    │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Anastasia      │Anastasia      │Anastasie      │Anastasia      │\r\n   │Anstace        │Anty           │               │Nastassja      │\r\n   │               │Stacy          │               │Nastenka       │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nAmongst these well-chosen baptismal titles may be mentioned Ζωή (Life),\r\nno doubt given as meaning that the principle of Eternal Life was then\r\nimplanted. It is strange that neither the Eastern nor Western calendar\r\nshows a Zoë, though a woman thus entitled was said to have been cured of\r\ndumbness by a miracle of St. Sebastian, and afterwards to have been the\r\nfirst of the martyrs in the persecution in which he died, about the year\r\n286. After this, Zoë became frequent among the women of the Greek\r\nChurch, belonging to many of the royal ladies of the Blachernal, among\r\nothers to her who endeavoured to shake the constancy of the sea-king,\r\nHarald Hardrada, to his Muscovite Elisif. From the lower empire it\r\ntravelled to Russia, where Zoia is at present very common, and in the\r\ntime of romantic interest in the new Greek kingdom, Zoé became\r\nfashionable in France, and still is much used there.[42]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Southey, Notes to _Curse of Kehama_; Snorre,\r\n  Sturleson, _Heimskringla_; Le Beau, _Bas Empire_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VII.—_Royal Names._\r\n\r\nΣέβας (Sebas), awe or veneration, was compounded into the word Σεβαστός\r\n(Sebastos), as a translation for Augustus, the imperial title coined by\r\nOctavianus to express his own peculiar sacred majesty.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, apparently used for the original Augustus; at least\r\nSt. Luke calls him Αὔγουστος; and its technical use probably did not\r\nbegin till the division of the empire by Diocletian, and his designation\r\nof two emperors as Augusti or Sebastoi, with their heirs as Cæsars.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to this arrangement no one would have dared to assume the\r\nname so intimately connected with the jealous wearers of the purple;\r\nand, accordingly, it was a contemporary of the joint emperors, who is\r\nthe martyr-saint of this name—Sebastianus, a soldier at Rome, who, when\r\nother Christians fled, remained there to encourage the flock in the\r\nfirst outburst of the last persecution. He endured a double martyrdom;\r\nfirst, by the well-known shower of arrows directed against him; and\r\nnext, after his recovery under the care of a pious widow, who had\r\ncarried away his supposed corpse to bury it, he defied the emperor\r\nagain, and was beaten to death in the arena by clubs.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   │Sebastian      │Sebastien      │Sebastiano     │Sebastian      │\r\n   │               │Bastien        │Bastiano       │               │\r\n   │               │               │Basto          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │    German.    │    Norse.     │   Bavarian.   │\r\n   │Sebastião      │Sebastian      │Sebastian      │Bastian        │\r\n   │Bastiao        │Bastian        │Baste          │Basti          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Swiss.     │   Russian.    │   Slavonic.   │   Hungarian   │\r\n   │Bastia         │Ssevastjan     │Bostjan        │Sebestyen      │\r\n   │Bastiali       │               │Bostej         │               │\r\n   │Bascho         │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    French.    │   Russian.    │   Bohemian.   │\r\n   │Sebastiane     │Sebastienne    │Ssevastjana    │Sebesta        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nDevout women buried him in the catacombs, and his name slept for at\r\nleast a hundred years till Pope Damasus built a church over his\r\ncatacomb, which has ever since been called after him, and subsequent\r\npopes made presents of his relics to Tuscany, France, and other\r\ncountries. A notion arose, Mrs. Jameson thinks, from his arrows\r\nreminding the classical world of the darts of Apollo, that he was\r\nconnected with pestilence. His name is thus found all over Europe,\r\nthough less commonly in England and the Protestant parts of Germany than\r\nfarther south. Indeed its especial home is Portugal, where it must have\r\nbeen specially cherished in memory of the rash Don Sebastião, the last\r\nof the glorious House of Avis, for whose return from the fatal African\r\ncampaign his country so long looked and longed.\r\n\r\nMore ancient was the term βασιλεύς (basileus), a king or prince,\r\nproperly answering to the Latin _rex_, as did Sebastos to Augustus, but\r\nusually applied in the Greek-speaking countries to the emperor. Thence\r\ncame many interesting words, such as the term used in the empire for\r\ncourts of royal judgment, Basilica, whence upon their conversion into\r\nplaces of Christian worship, the title Basilicon became synonymous with\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nSo, too, that royal-looking serpent who was supposed to wear a crown on\r\nhis head, and to kill with a look, was the basilisk; and the familiar\r\nbasilicon ointment was so termed as being fit for a king.\r\n\r\nΒασίλειος (kingly) was not infrequent among the early Christians, and\r\ngained popularity through that great father of the Church, the Bishop of\r\nNeo-Cæsarea, as well as other more obscure saints. It is extremely\r\ncommon in the Eastern Church, and especially in Russia, where the first\r\nletter suffers the usual change into _V_. The feminine, Basilia, is\r\nstill in use among the modern Greeks, and once even seems to have been\r\nknown among English ladies, since the sister of Earl Strongbow is thus\r\nrecorded in history, but its use has died away amongst us.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Russian.  │  Polish.   │\r\n   │Basil       │Basile      │Basilio     │Vassilij    │Bazyli      │\r\n   │            │Basine      │            │Vasska      │  ————————  │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │ Illyrian.  │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │Vassilij    │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │Vaso        │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VIII.—_Irene._\r\n\r\nIn heathen days Εἰρήνη (Eirene), peace, was personified and adored as a\r\ngoddess; in Christian times, when peace on earth was preached, it was\r\nformed into a name—that which we know as Irene. Irene was the pious\r\nwidow, whose care revived St. Sebastian after his first martyrdom, and\r\nin 303, three sisters, Agape (love), Irene, and Chionia underwent\r\nmartyrdom at Thessalonica, but Irene seems to have absorbed almost all\r\nthe subsequent honour, although Agapè is occasionally to be found in\r\nmodern Greece, and formed the masculine surname Agapetus, once the\r\nproperty of a pope, and still used in Russia.\r\n\r\nIrene was extremely frequent among the Greek empresses, and belonged to\r\nthe lady who would fain have added herself to the list of Charlemagne’s\r\nmany wives. Thence the Russians have it as Eereena, and in that ancient\r\nGreek colony at Sorrento, where the women’s features so strongly recall\r\ntheir Hellenic descent, Irene is continued as one of their baptismal\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThence was derived the name of the great father of the Church, Εἰρηναῖος\r\n(Eirenaios), Irenæus; but few of the fathers had popular names, and\r\nIrenæus has been little copied, except in Eastern Europe, where the\r\nRussians call it Irinej, and the Hungarians, Ernijó.\r\n\r\nThe Teuton _fried_ and Slavonic _mir_ have been infinitely more fruitful\r\nin names than the Greek Irene, and as to the Roman _pax_, its\r\ncontributions to nomenclature are all posthumous.\r\n\r\nErasmus comes from ἰράω (íráo), to love, and is related to Eros. The\r\nfirst Erasmus was tortured to death in Diocletian’s persecution, at\r\nFormici, whence his relics were transferred to Gaeta, and he there\r\nbecame the patron of the Mediterranean sailors, who used to invoke him\r\nas St. Ermo or St. Elmo, at the approach of a storm, and he thus was\r\nthought to send the pale pure electric light that shimmers on the\r\ntopmast, warning the sailor of the impending storm. The name of Erasmus\r\nwas assumed by the learned Dutchman, under the belief that it translated\r\nhis name of Gerhard (_really_ spearhard), and from him Rasmus and Asmus\r\nare common in Holland, and Rasl has somehow found its way to Bavaria.\r\nRussia, too, has Jerassom, but this name lies in doubt between Erasmus\r\nand Gerasimus (the venerable), one of the early ascetics of Palestine.\r\n\r\nGelasius, the laugher, was the name of a pope, and for that reason was\r\nconsidered as appropriate and ecclesiastical. It has had the strange lot\r\nof being used in Ireland as the substitute for their native name of\r\nGiolla Iosa, or servant of Jesus, and was actually so used by the\r\nPrimate reigning at the time of the English annexation of Ireland.[43]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Le Beau; Smith; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION IX.—_Gregorios._\r\n\r\nΓρηγόριος (Gregorios), came from γρηγορέω, a late and corrupt form of\r\nthe verb ἐγείρω (to wake or watch). A watchman was a highly appropriate\r\nterm for a shepherd of the Church, and accordingly Gregorios was\r\nfrequent among early bishops. Gregorios Nazianzen the friend of St.\r\nBasil, Gregorios Thaumaturgos or the wonder-worker, and others of the\r\nsame high fame, contributed to render it highly popular in the East, and\r\nin the West it was borne by the great pope, for whose sake it became a\r\nfavourite papal title, so that it has been borne by no less than sixteen\r\noccupants of the chair of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been far less popular among those who own their sway\r\nthan among the Eastern Christians who are free from it, and though we\r\nfind it in Scandinavia, this is only as a modernization of the Norse\r\nGrjotgard, while the Macgregors of Scotland draw their descent not from\r\nGregory, but from Grig or Gairig, a Keltic word meaning the fierce.[44]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Gregory        │Gregoire       │Gregorio       │Gregos         │\r\n   │               │  ——————————   │               │Gregus         │\r\n   │               │    German.    │               │  ——————————   │\r\n   │               │Gregor         │               │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │               │Gregus         │               │Greis          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │   Slavonic.   │\r\n   │Grigorij       │Grzegorz       │Rehor          │Gregor         │\r\n   │Grischa        │               │               │Grega          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gorej          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Illyrian.   │     Lett.     │  Lithuanian.  │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Gregorije      │Grigg          │Greszkus       │Gergelj        │\r\n   │Gerga          │               │Grygallis      │Gero           │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Michaelis; Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION X.—_Georgos._\r\n\r\nThe Maronite Christians have a tradition that Georgos was a Christian\r\nsentinel at Damascus, who connived at the escape of St. Paul, when he\r\nwas let down in the basket, and was therefore put to death; but whether\r\nthis be true or false, among what may be called the allegorical saints\r\nof the Greek Church, one of the most noted is our own patron Γῆ (Ge),\r\nearth, and ἔργω (ergo), anciently Γέργω (fergo), descended from the same\r\nsource as our own verbs to work and to urge, formed Γεωργός (earthworker\r\nor husbandman). A Cappadocian saint and martyr, of whom nothing was\r\nknown but that he had been a soldier and died in the last persecution,\r\nbore the name of Georgios, and was deeply reverenced in the East, where\r\nConstantine erected a church in his honour at Byzantium. As in the case\r\nof St. Christopher, and probably of St. Alexis, this honoured name\r\nbecame the nucleus of the allegory, of the warrior saint contending with\r\nthe dragon, and delivering the oppressed Church, and of course the\r\nlovers of marvel turned the parable into substance. In 494, Pope\r\nGelasius tried to separate the true Georgius from the legend, which he\r\nomitted from the offices of the Church, but popular fancy was too strong\r\nfor the pope, and the story was carried on till the imaginations of the\r\nCrusaders before Jerusalem fixed upon St. George as the miraculous\r\nchampion whom they beheld fighting in their cause, as Santiago had done\r\nfor Galicia. Thereby Burgundy and Aquitaine adopted him as their patron\r\nsaint; and the Burgundian Henry carried him to Portugal, and put that\r\nrealm under his protection; as a hundred years later Richard I. did by\r\nEngland, making “St. George for merry England” the most renowned of\r\nbattle-cries. From Burgundy he was taken by the Germans as a patron; and\r\nVenice, always connected with Greece, already glorified him as her\r\npatron, so that “In the name of St. George and St. Michael I dub thee\r\nknight,” was the formulary throughout half Europe, and no saint had so\r\nmany chivalrous orders instituted in his honour.\r\n\r\nStill the name was less early used in the West than might have been\r\nexpected, perhaps from the difficulty of pronunciation. Georgios always\r\nprevailed in the East, and came to Scotland in the grand Hungarian\r\nimportation, with the ancestor of the House of Drummond, who bear three\r\nwavy lines on their shield in memory of a great battle fought by the\r\nside of a river in Hungary, before the Atheling family were brought back\r\nto England, attended by this Hungarian noble. On the usurpation of\r\nHarold, he fled with them to Scotland, and there founded a family where\r\nthe Eastern Christian name of George has always been an heir-loom. It\r\nwas probably from the same Hungarian source that Germany first adopted\r\nGeorg, or Jürgen, as it is differently spelt, and thence sent it to\r\nEngland with the House of Brunswick; for, in spite of George of\r\nClarence, brother of Edward IV., and a few other exceptions, it had been\r\nan unusual name previously, and scarcely a single George appears in our\r\nparish registers before 1700, although afterwards it multiplied to such\r\nan extent as to make it doubtful whether George, John, or Charles be the\r\nmost common designation of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe feminine is quite a modernism. The first English lady on record, so\r\ncalled, was a godchild of Anne of Denmark, who caused her to be\r\nchristened Georgia Anna. The name had, however, previously existed on\r\nthe Continent.\r\n\r\nVenice took its Giorgio direct from Greece, but the name was not popular\r\nelsewhere in Italy; and at Cambrai, an isolated instance occurs in the\r\nyear 1300, nor has it ever been common in France. The Welsh Urien\r\n(Uranius) descends from heaven to earth by considering George as his\r\nequivalent. The Irish translate the name into Keltic as Seoirgi.[45]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   │George         │George         │Georges        │Giorgio        │\r\n   │Georgy         │Geordie        │Georget        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │  Wallachian.  │   Provençal   │\r\n   │Jorge          │Jorge          │Georgie        │Jortz          │\r\n   │               │Jorgezinho     │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Frisian.    │   Bavarian.   │    Swiss.     │\r\n   │Georg          │Jurgen         │Görgel         │Jörg           │\r\n   │Jurgen         │Jurn           │Gergel         │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Swedish.    │    Danish.    │    Dutch.     │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Göran          │Georg          │Georgius       │Gayeirgee      │\r\n   │               │Jorgen         │Joris          │Georgij        │\r\n   │               │               │Jurriaan       │Jurgi          │\r\n   │               │               │Jurria         │Egor           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Egorka         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │   Slavonic.   │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Jerzy          │Jiri           │Jurg           │Giuraj         │\r\n   │               │               │Jurck          │Giuro          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Giuko          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Djuradj        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Djurica        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Juro           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Jurica         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │     Lett.     │  Lithuanian.  │  Esthonian.   │\r\n   │Juro           │Jorrgis        │Jurgis         │Jurn           │\r\n   │Jurko          │Jurrusch       │Jurguttis      │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │Georgiana      │Georgine       │Georgine       │Georgeta       │\r\n   │Georgina       │Georgette      │               │  ——————————   │\r\n   │               │               │               │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gjurjija       │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gjurgjinka     │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Jameson; Butler; Michaelis; O'Donovan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XI.—_Barbara._\r\n\r\nOf the four great virgin saints, revered with almost passionate\r\naffection in the Roman Catholic Church, each has been made the\r\nrepresentative of an idea. Probably Agnes, Barbara, Katharine, and\r\nMargaret were veritable maidens who perished in the early persecutions,\r\nand whose lives, save for some horrible incident in their tortures, were\r\nunknown; but around them crystallized the floating allegories of the\r\nChurch, until Agnes became the representative of the triumph of\r\ninnocence, Margaret of the victory through faith, Katharine of\r\nintellectual, and Barbara of artistic devotion. There was a speedy lapse\r\nfrom the allegory to the legend, just as of old, from the figure to the\r\nmyth; and the virgins' popularity in all countries depended, not on\r\ntheir shadowy names in the calendar, but on the implicitly credited\r\ntales of wonder connected with them.\r\n\r\nBarbara was said to be a maiden of Heliopolis, whose Christianity was\r\nrevealed by her insisting that a bath-chamber should be built with three\r\nwindows instead of two, in honour of the chief mystery of the Creed. Her\r\ncruel father beheaded her with his own hands, and was immediately\r\ndestroyed by thunder and lightning. Here, of course, was symbolized the\r\nconsecration of architecture and the fine arts to express religious\r\nideas, and St. Barbara became the patroness of architects, and thence of\r\nengineers, and the protectress from thunder and its mimic, artillery.\r\nThe powder room in a French ship is still known as _la sainte Barbe_.\r\nHer name has thus been widely spread, though chiefly among the daughters\r\nof artificers and soldiers, seldom rising to princely rank. Barbara is\r\nthe feminine of βάρβαρος (a stranger), the term applied by the Greeks to\r\nall who did not speak their own tongue. Horne Tooke derives it from the\r\nroot _bar_ (strong), and thinks it a repetition of the savage people’s\r\nown reduplicated bar-bar (very strong); but it is far more probably an\r\nimitation of the incomprehensible speech of the strangers; as, in fact,\r\nthe Greeks seem rather to have applied it first to the polished Asiatic,\r\nwho would have given them less the idea of strength than the Scyth or\r\nthe Goth, to whose language _bar_ belonged in the sense of force or\r\nopposition. It is curious to observe how, in modern languages, the\r\nprogeny of the Latin _barbarus_ vary between the sense of wild cruelty\r\nand mere rude ignorance, or ill-adapted splendour.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Barbara        │Babie          │Barbe          │Barbara        │\r\n   │Bab            │               │               │               │\r\n   │Barbary        │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Danish.    │    German.    │    Swiss.     │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Barbraa        │Barbara        │Baba           │Varvara        │\r\n   │               │Barbeli        │Babali         │Varinka        │\r\n   │               │Barbechen      │Babeli         │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Slavonic.   │   Illyrian.   │   Bohemian.   │   Lusatian.   │\r\n   │Barbara        │Barbara        │Barbora        │Baba           │\r\n   │Barba          │Varvara        │               │Babuscha       │\r\n   │Barbica        │Bara           │               │               │\r\n   │               │Vara           │               │               │\r\n   │               │Barica         │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │     Lett.     │  Lithuanian.  │  Hungarian.   │               │\r\n   │Barbule        │Barbe          │Borbola        │               │\r\n   │Barbe          │Barbutte       │Boris          │               │\r\n   │Babbe          │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe true old English form is Barbary. It appears thus in all the\r\nunlatinized pedigrees and registers; and the peasantry still call it so,\r\nthough unluckily it is generally turned into Barbara in writing.[46]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Jameson; Horne Tooke; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XII.—_Agnes._\r\n\r\nThe word ἄγος (agos), a thing to which religious awe attaches, gave the\r\nadjective ἄγνος (agnos), sacred or pure, whence was named the tree whose\r\ntwigs the Greek matrons strewed on their beds during the festival of\r\nDemeter, and which the Romans called by a reduplication of its title in\r\nboth languages, the Agnus Castus. Agnus, the Latin for a lamb, is said\r\nto have come from the consecration of those creatures to sacred\r\npurposes; and thence, too, came Agnes, the name of the gentle Roman\r\nmaiden, the place of whose martyrdom named the church of Sant' Agnese.\r\nIt is said to have been built by Constantine the Great only a few years\r\nafter her death, on the spot where she was put to the utmost proof; and\r\nit retains an old mosaic, representing her veiled only by her long hair,\r\nand driven along by two fierce soldiers.\r\n\r\nAnother very ancient church of Sant' Agnese covers the catacomb where\r\nshe was interred, and she has always been a most popular saint both in\r\nthe East and West, but most especially at her native city. There a\r\nlegend became current, probably from her name, that as her parents and\r\nother Christians were weeping over her grave in the catacomb, she\r\nsuddenly stood before them all radiant in glory, and beside her a lamb\r\nof spotless whiteness. She assured them of her perfect bliss, encouraged\r\nthem, and bade them weep no more; and thus in all later representations\r\nof her, a lamb has always been her emblem, though it does not appear in\r\nthe numerous very early figures of her that are still preserved.\r\n\r\nA saint who was the object of so many legends could not fail of numerous\r\nvotaries, and Agnes was common in England and Scotland, and was a royal\r\nname in France and Germany. The Welsh form is Nest. A Welsh Nest was the\r\nmother of Earl Robert of Gloucester. Iñes, as the Spaniards make it,\r\nindicating the liquid sound of the _gn_ by the cedilla, gained a\r\nmournful fame in Portugal by the fate of Iñez de Castro, and Iñesila has\r\nbeen derived from it, while the former English taste for stately\r\nterminations to simple old names made the word Agneta. It is more common\r\nin Devonshire than in other counties. In Durham, there is a curious\r\ncustom of calling any female of weak intellect, “a Silly Agnes.” Italy\r\nhas invented the masculine Agnolo and Agnello, often confounded with\r\nAngelo, and used as its contraction.[47]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Welsh.     │     Manx.     │    French.    │\r\n   │Agnes          │Nest           │Nessie         │Agnes          │\r\n   │Aggie          │               │               │Agnies         │\r\n   │Agneta         │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │   Portugues   │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Agnese         │Ines           │Inez           │Agnes          │\r\n   │Agnete         │Inesila        │               │Agneta         │\r\n   │Agnesca        │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Danish.    │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Slavonic.   │\r\n   │Agnes          │Agnessa        │Agnizka        │Neza           │\r\n   │Agnete         │Agnessija      │   —————————   │Nezika         │\r\n   │               │               │   Bohemian.   │               │\r\n   │               │               │Anezka         │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Servian.    │     Lett.     │   Esthonian   │  Lithuanian.  │\r\n   │Janja          │Agnese         │Neto           │Agnyta         │\r\n   │   —————————   │Nese           │               │               │\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │               │               │               │\r\n   │Hanza          │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Jameson; Brand, _Popular Antiquities_; Liddell and Scott; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION XIII.—_Margaret._\r\n\r\nNo name has been the occasion of more pretty fancies than Μαργαρίτης (a\r\npearl), itself taken from the Persian term for the jewel, Murvarid\r\n(child of light), in accordance with the beauteous notion that the\r\noysters rising to the surface of the water at night and opening their\r\nshells in adoration, received into their mouths drops of dew congealed\r\nby the moon-beams into the pure and exquisite gem, resembling in its\r\npure pale lustre nothing so much as the moon herself, “_la gran\r\nMargherita_,” as Dante calls her. The thought of the pearl of great\r\nprice, and of the pearl gates of the celestial city, no doubt inspired\r\nthe Christian choice of Margarite for that child of light of the city of\r\nAntioch in Pisidia, whose name as virgin martyr standing in the Liturgy\r\nwithout any authentic history, became, before the fifth century, the\r\nrecipient of the allegory of feminine innocence and faith overcoming the\r\ndragon, even as St. George embodied the victory of the Christian\r\nwarrior. Greek though the legend were, as well as the name, neither\r\nflourished in the Eastern Church; but Cremona laid claim to the maiden’s\r\nrelics, and Hungary in its first Christianity eagerly adopted her name,\r\nand reckons two saints so called in the eleventh century, besides having\r\nsent forth the sweet Margaret Ætheling, the wife of Malcolm Ceanmohr,\r\nthe gentle royal saint of the Grace Cup, who has made hers the national\r\nScottish female name. From Scotland it went to Norway with the daughter\r\nof Alexander III., whose bridal cost the life of Sir Patrick Spens; and\r\nit had nearly come back again from thence with her child, the Maid of\r\nNorway; but the Maid died on the voyage, and Margaret remained in\r\nScandinavia to be the dreaded name of the Semiramis of the North, and\r\nwas taken as the equivalent of Astrid and of Grjotgard. From Cremona\r\nGermany learnt to know the child-like Margarethe, one of the saints and\r\nnames most frequently occurring there; and Provence, then an integral\r\npart of the Holy Roman Empire, likewise adopted her. From her was called\r\nthe eldest of the four heiresses of Provence, who married St. Louis,\r\nleaving Marguérite to numerous French princesses. Her niece, the\r\ndaughter of Henry III., was the first English Margaret; but the name was\r\nre-imported from France in the second wife of Edward I., and again in\r\nMargaret of Anjou, from whom was called Margaret Beaufort, mother of\r\nHenry VII., and founder of the Lady Margaret professorship.\r\n\r\nIn her grand-daughter, Margaret Tudor, it ceased to be royal in England,\r\nthough it had taken root among the northern part of the population,\r\nwhile, strangely enough, it hardly ever occurs among the southern\r\npeasantry. The Italian reverence for Margherita, or Malgherita, as they\r\ncalled her, was increased by the penitence of Margherita of Cortona,\r\nwhose repentance became so famed that she was canonized. Many are the\r\ncontractions of this favourite name, since it is too long for the\r\npopular mouth. The oldest is probably the Scottish Marjorie, as Bruce’s\r\ndaughter was called, and which cut down into Maisie, the “proud Maisie”\r\nof the ballad, and later into Mysie, and was treated as a separate name.\r\nMr. Lower tells us that the surname of Marjoribanks is derived from the\r\nbarony of Raltio, granted to Marjorie Bruce on her marriage with the\r\nHigh Steward of Scotland. Margaret turned into Meg before the time of\r\n“Muckle-moued Meg of the Border,” and this as well as Maggie was shared\r\nwith England, which likewise had Margery and Marget, as well as the more\r\nvulgar Peggy and Gritty, and likewise Madge.\r\n\r\nThe French contraction was in the sixteenth century Margot, according to\r\nthe epitaph, self-composed, of the Austrian, Flemish, or French damsel,\r\nwho was so nearly Queen of Spain:\r\n\r\n                “Ci gît Margot, la gentille demoiselle,\r\n                Qui a deux maris et encore est pucelle.”\r\n\r\nBut Gogo is not an improvement. Marcharit is the Breton form.\r\n\r\nIn Germany Grethel figures in various ‘_Mahrchen_,’ but Gretchen is now\r\nmost common, and is rendered classical by Goethe. Mete in the time of\r\nKlopstock’s sway over the lovers of religious poetry was very\r\nfashionable; and Meta almost took up her abode in England, though the\r\ntaste for simplicity has routed her of late.\r\n\r\nDenmark, where the Semiramis of the North has domesticated the name,\r\ncalls it Mette and Maret, and places it in many a popular tale and\r\nballad as Metelill, or little Margaret.\r\n\r\nEven the modern German Jews use it and call it Marialit; and the\r\nVernacular Gaelic contraction used in Ireland is Vread, though Mairgreg\r\nis the proper form.[48]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Margaret       │Margaret       │Marguérite     │Margherita     │\r\n   │Margaretta     │Marjorie       │Margot         │Malgherita     │\r\n   │Margery        │Maisie         │Margoton       │Ghita          │\r\n   │Maggy          │Maidie         │Goton          │Rita           │\r\n   │Meggy          │Maggie         │Gogo           │               │\r\n   │Madge          │Meg            │               │               │\r\n   │Marget         │May            │               │               │\r\n   │Peggy          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Gritty         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Meta           │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │    German.    │    Swiss.     │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Margarita      │Margarethe     │Margarete      │Margarete      │\r\n   │   —————————   │Grete          │Gretli         │Mette          │\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │Gretchen       │               │Maret          │\r\n   │Margarida      │Grethe         │               │Melletel       │\r\n   │               │Grethel        │               │               │\r\n   │               │Grel           │               │               │\r\n   │               │Marghet        │               │               │\r\n   │               │Mete           │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │   Slavonic.   │   Finland.    │\r\n   │Margareta      │Markota        │Marjarita      │Reta           │\r\n   │Malgorzata     │               │Marjeta        │               │\r\n   │Malgosia       │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │  Lithuanian.  │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Margrete       │Maret          │Magryta        │Margarta       │\r\n   │Greta          │Kret           │Gryta          │Margit         │\r\n   │Maije          │Krot           │Greta          │               │\r\n   │Madsche        │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Reeves, _Conchology_; Liddell and Scott; Butler; Michaelis; Grimm;\r\n  Weber, _Northern Romance_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION XIV.—_Katharine._\r\n\r\nThe maiden martyr, whose name was chosen as the centre of the allegory\r\nof intellectual religion, was Καθαρινή (Kathariné), Catharina in Latin,\r\nfrom a virgin martyr of Alexandria, whose history being unknown, became\r\nanother recipient of a half-allegorical legend. It is not found recorded\r\nearlier than the eighth century, and, indeed, the complete ignorance of\r\nthe state of the Roman empire, shown by making her the daughter of a\r\nking of Egypt, argues its development at a very late period. Her\r\nexceeding wisdom, her heavenly espousals, her rejection of the suit of\r\nMaximus, the destruction of the wheels that were to have torn her in\r\npieces, her martyrdom by the sword, and the translation of her body by\r\nangels to Mount Sinai, are all familiar through the numerous artistic\r\nworks that have celebrated her. The legend is thought to have grown up\r\nto its full height among the monks of the convent that bears her name at\r\nthe foot of Mount Sinai. And the many pilgrims thither had the zest of a\r\nnew and miraculous legend, such as seems always to have been more\r\npopular than the awful truth beside which it grew up; but it never\r\nobtained credit enough in the East to make Katharina come into use as a\r\nname in the Greek Church, and it was only when the Crusaders brought\r\nhome the story that it spread in ballad and mystery throughout the West.\r\nIndeed, the name did not prevail till it had been borne by the Italian\r\ndevotee, Santa Caterina of Sienna, who tried to imagine the original\r\nKatharina’s history renewed in herself, and whose influence is one of\r\nthe marvels of the middle ages. Before this, however, the fair\r\nKatharine, Countess of Salisbury, had been the heroine of the Garter,\r\nand John of Gaunt had named the daughter, who, as Queen of Castille,\r\nmade Catalina a Spanish name, whence it returned to us again with\r\nKatharine of Aragon; but in the mean time Catherine de Valois, the Queen\r\nof Henry V., had brought it again from France.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the various ways of spelling this word would appear to be\r\nthat the more ancient English made no use of the letter _K_, which only\r\ncame in with printing and the types imported from Germany. Miss\r\nCatherine Fanshaw wrote a playful poem in defence of the commencement\r\nwith _C_, avouching _K_ to be no Saxon letter, and referring to the\r\nshrewish Katharina and the Russian empress as examples of the bad repute\r\nof the _K_; but her argument breaks down, since the faithful Spanish\r\nCatalina, as English queen, wrote herself Katharine, while the ‘Shrew’\r\nin Italy could only have been Caterina, and the Russian empress is on\r\nher coins Ekaterina. On the whole, Katherine would seem properly to be a\r\nnamesake of the Alexandrian princess, Catherine, the Votaress of Sienna.\r\nNo name is more universal in all countries and in all ranks, partly from\r\nits own beauty of sound, partly from association, and none has more\r\nvaried contractions. Our truest old English ones are Kate and Kitty—the\r\nlatter was almost universal in the last century, though now supplanted\r\nby the Scottish Katie and the graceful Irish Kathleen.\r\n\r\nCatherine has even produced a masculine name. Perhaps Anne and Mary are\r\nthe only others which have been thus honoured; but the sole instance is\r\nCaterino or Catherin Davila, the historian, who had the misfortune to\r\nhave Catherine de Medici for his godmother.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    Irish.     │    Welsh.     │\r\n   │Katharine      │Catharine      │Kathleen       │Cathwg         │\r\n   │Catherine      │Katie          │Katty          │               │\r\n   │Catharina      │  ——————————   │               │  ——————————   │\r\n   │Kate           │    Dutch.     │               │     Bret.     │\r\n   │Kitty          │Kaat           │               │Katel          │\r\n   │Katrine        │Kaatje         │               │Katelik        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    French.    │  Portuguese.  │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Cathérine      │Catharine      │Catalina       │Caterina       │\r\n   │Catant         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Caton          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Gaton          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Trinette       │               │               │               │\r\n   │Cataut         │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Swedish.    │    Danish.    │    German.    │   Dantzic.    │\r\n   │Katarina       │Kathrina       │Katharine      │Trien          │\r\n   │Kajsa          │Karina         │Kathchen       │Kasche         │\r\n   │Kolina         │Karen          │Kathe          │               │\r\n   │               │Kasen          │Thrine         │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Bavarian.   │    Swiss.     │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Katrine        │Kathri         │Ekaterina      │Katarnyna      │\r\n   │Kadreinl       │Kathrili       │Katinka        │Kasia          │\r\n   │Treinel        │Tri            │Katinsha       │               │\r\n   │Kadl           │Trili          │Katja          │               │\r\n   │Kattel         │Trine          │               │               │\r\n   │Ketterle       │Hati           │               │               │\r\n   │               │Hatili         │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Slovak.    │   Illyrian.   │  Esthonian.   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Katrina        │Katarina       │Katri          │Katalin        │\r\n   │Katra          │Katica         │Kaddo          │Kati           │\r\n   │Katrej         │               │Kats           │Katicza        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION XV.—_Harvest Names._\r\n\r\nFrom θέρω (to heat) was derived θέρος (summer), which, in sunny Greece,\r\ncame likewise to mean the summer crop, just as in Germany _Herbst_\r\nserves for both autumn and harvest. θερίζω (to reap or gather in the\r\ncrop), and from this verb comes the pretty feminine Theresa, the reaper.\r\n“The first to bear the predestined name of Theresa,” as Montalembert\r\nsays, was a Spanish lady, the wife of a Roman noble called Paulinus,\r\nboth devotees under the guidance of St. Jerome, whose writings most\r\nremarkably stamped the memory of his friends upon posterity; and this\r\noriginal Theresa was copied again and again by her own countrywomen,\r\ntill we find Teresa on the throne of Leon in the tenth century. The name\r\nwas confined to the Peninsula until the sixteenth century, when that\r\nremarkable woman, Saint Teresa, made the Roman Catholic Church resound\r\nwith the fame of her enthusiastic devotion. The Spanish connection of\r\nthe House of Austria rendered it a favourite with the princesses both of\r\nSpain and Germany. The Queen of Louis XIV. promoted it in France as\r\nThérèse, and it is specially common in Provence as Térézon, for short,\r\nZon. The empress-queen greatly added to its fame; and it is known\r\neverywhere, though more in Roman Catholic countries and families than\r\nelsewhere.

And\r\nto these may be added that of the old Cypriot shepherd hermit Σπυρίδων\r\n(Spiridōn), from σπυρίς (a round basket). He was afterwards a bishop,\r\nand one of the fathers of Nicea, then going home, died at a great age,\r\nasleep in his corn field; in honour of whom Spiridione, or Spiro, as the\r\nItalianized Greeks call it, is one of the most popular of all names in\r\nthe Ionian Islands, and has the feminine Spira.[49]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Montalembert; Surius; Anderson, _Genealogies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION XVI.—_Names from Jewels._\r\n\r\nMargaret, which has been spoken of elsewhere, is the most noted of jewel\r\nnames, and it probably suggested the few others that have prevailed.\r\n\r\nΣμάραγδος (Smaragdos) is supposed to have been named from μαίρω or\r\nμαρμαίρω (to twinkle or sparkle), whence the dog-star was called Μαῖρα\r\n(Maira). This beauteous precious stone, bearing the colour of hope, was\r\nfurther recommended to Christians because the rainbow of St. John’s\r\nvision was “in sight like unto an emerald.” Thus, Smaragdos was one of\r\nthe early martyrs; and the same occurs occasionally in early times, once\r\nas an exarch of Ravenna; but it was never frequent enough to be a\r\nrecognized name, except in two very remote quarters, namely, as the\r\nSpanish Esmeralda and the Cornish Meraud, the last nearly, if not quite,\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThe Sapphire was erased for ever from the nomenclature of Christians by\r\nthe fate of the unhappy Sapphira, except that Σαπφήρω (Sapphēro), a name\r\nthus derived, is used among the modern Greeks of the Ionian Islands; and\r\nso also is Διαμάντω (Diamanto).\r\n\r\nFor want of a better place, the Italian name Gemma must here be\r\nmentioned, though purely Latin, and coming from a word meaning the young\r\ncrimson bud of a tree, though since used for a gem or jewel. In Erse\r\nGemlorg, gem-like, is almost exactly the same in sound and spirit.\r\n\r\nMoreover, both precious metals are used as female names in modern\r\nGreece, Ἀργύρω (Argyro), silver, connecting itself with the Arianwen, or\r\nsilver lady, of Wales; and Χρυσωῦχα (Chrysoucha) from Χρυσός (Chrysós),\r\ngold. This latter word has formed many other names, beginning from\r\nChryses and his daughter Chryseis, whose ransom was the original cause\r\nof “Achilles' wrath of mighty woes the spring.” In the soubriquet of\r\nChrysostomos, or Golden Mouth, we have already seen it, and it is found\r\nalso in Χρύσανθος (Chrysanthos), golden flower, the husband of Saint\r\nDaria, in whose honour prevails the Bavarian Chrysanth or Santerl.\r\n\r\nMuriel, an old English name, comes from μύρον (myrrh). Both it and\r\nMeriel were once common, and have lately been revived.[50]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Smith, _Life of Chaucer_; Butler; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION XVII.—_Kosmos and Damianos._\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of the relics of saints had already begun even in the fourth\r\ncentury. No church was thought thoroughly consecrated save by the bones\r\nof some sainted Christian, and it was during the first fervour that led\r\nmen to seek the bodies of the martyrs in their hiding-places, that St.\r\nAmbrose discovered the bodies of two persons at Milan, whom a dream\r\npronounced to be Kosmos and Damianos, two martyred Christians.\r\n\r\nThey, of course, were placed among the patrons of Milan, and their names\r\nbecame favourites in Italy. Kosmos originally meant order; but, having\r\nbeen applied to the order of nature, has in our day come usually to mean\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nCosimo, or Cosmo, as the Italians called it, was used at Milan and\r\nFlorence, where it gained renown in the person of the great man who made\r\nthe family of Medici eminent, and who prepared the way for their\r\naspirations to the elevation that proved their bane and corruption.\r\nFrance calls the word Côme without using it as a name, and Russia adopts\r\nit as Kauzma.\r\n\r\nDamianos was from the verb δαμάω, identical with our own tame, which we\r\nhave already seen in composition. He had a good many chivalrous\r\nnamesakes, as Damiano, Damiao, Damien, and the Russians call him Demjan.\r\nThe old Welsh Dyfan is another form strangely changed by pronunciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION XVIII.—_Alethea, &c._\r\n\r\nἈλήθεια (Aletheia), truth, came from α and λήθω (to hide), and thus\r\nmeans openness and sincerity.\r\n\r\nWhen it first came to be used as a name is not clear. Aletha, of Padua,\r\nappears in 1411; and the princess, on whose account Charles I., when\r\nPrince of Wales, made his journey to Spain, was Doña Maria Aletea. About\r\nthat time Alethea made her appearance in the noble family of Saville,\r\nand either to a real or imaginary Alethea were addressed the famous\r\nlines of the captive cavalier:—\r\n\r\n                   “Stone walls do not a prison make,\r\n                     Nor iron bars a cage.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, in 1669, Alethea Brandling, at the age of nine, was married to\r\none Henry Hitch, esq., and the name occurs several times in Durham\r\npedigrees.\r\n\r\nAs far as the English Alethea is concerned, she is probably the\r\nalteration of an Irish name, for she chiefly belongs to the other\r\nisland, and is there called Letty. What feminine it was meant to\r\ntranslate must be uncertain, perhaps Tuathflaith (the noble lady). Tom\r\nMoore called his Egyptian heroine Atethe, from the adjective, and this\r\nhas been in consequence sometimes used as a name.\r\n\r\nThe name Althea must not be confounded with it. This last is Ἄλθεια\r\n(wholesome). It belonged of old to the unfortunate mother of Meleager,\r\nand now designates a genus of mallows, in allusion to their healing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nWe find the prefix πρό, forming part of the word προκοπή (progress),\r\nwhence the name Προκόπιος (Prokopios); in Latin, Procopius, progressive.\r\nIt was the name of a martyr under Diocletian, in Palestine, and is a\r\nfavourite in the Greek Church. The short-lived successor of Jovian was\r\nso called; also the great Byzantine historian; and now Prokopij is very\r\ncommon among the Russian clergy; and Prokop or Prokupek has found its\r\nway into Bohemia. Russia, likewise, uses in the form of Prokhor, the\r\nname of Próchorus (Πρόχορας), one of the seven deacons, and much\r\nGræcized indeed must the imaginations of his Jewish parents have been\r\nwhen they gave him such an appellation, signifying the leader of the\r\nchoral dances in the Greek theatres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                          LATIN NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have had to deal with names at once explained by the\r\nlanguage of those who originally bore them. With a very few exceptions,\r\nchiefly in the case of traditional deities, the word has only to be\r\ndivided into its component parts, and its meaning is evident, and there\r\nwas a constant fabrication of fresh appellations in analogy with the\r\nelder ones, and suited to the spirit of the times in which they were\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nBut on passing the Gulf of Adria we come upon a nation of mingled blood,\r\nand even more mingled language, constantly in a condition of change;\r\ntheir elder history disguised by legends, their ancient songs\r\nunintelligible to the very persons who sang them, their very deities and\r\nrites confused with those of Greece, till they were not fully understood\r\neven by their most cultivated men; and their names, which were not\r\nindividual but hereditary, belonging to forgotten languages, and often\r\nconveying no signification to their owner.\r\n\r\nThe oldest inhabitants of Italy are thought to have been Pelasgi, which\r\nis argued, among other causes, from the structure of the language\r\nresembling the Greek, and from the simple homely terms common to both;\r\nbut while the Pelasgi of the Eastern Peninsula became refined and\r\nbrought to perfection by the Hellenes, the purest tribe of their own\r\nrace, those of the Western Peninsula were subjected to the influence of\r\nvarious other nations. In the centre of Italy the Pelasgians appear to\r\nhave been overrun by a race called Oscans, Priscans, or Cascans, who\r\nbecame fused with them, and called themselves Prisci Latini, and their\r\ncountry Latium or Lavinium. Their tongue was the elder Latin, and the\r\nOscan is believed to have supplied the element which is not Greek, but\r\nhas something in common both with Kelt and Teuton. These Latins were,\r\nthere can be no doubt, the direct ancestors of the Romans, whose\r\npolitical constitution, manners, and language, were the same, only in an\r\nadvanced condition.\r\n\r\nRoman legend and poetry brought the fugitive Æneas from Troy to conquer\r\nLatium, and found Alba Longa; and after the long line of Alban kings,\r\nthe twins, Romulus and Remus, founded the City of the Seven Hills, and\r\nfilled it with Latins, _i. e._ the mixed Pelasgic and Oscan race of\r\nLatium. The first tribe of pure Oscans who came in contact with the\r\nRomans were the Sabines, who, after the war begun by the seizure of the\r\nSabine women, made common cause with Rome, and thus contributed a fresh\r\nOscan element to both blood and language. The Oscan race extended to the\r\nSouth, divided into many tribes, and their language was spoken in a pure\r\nstate by the southern peasantry far on into Roman history. The numerous\r\nGreek colonies which caused the South to be termed Magna Græcia, became\r\nin time mingled with the Oscans, and gave the whole of Apulia, Bruttium,\r\nand Calabria, a very different character from that of central Italy.\r\n\r\nNorthward of Latium was the powerful and mysterious race calling\r\nthemselves the Raseni, and known to the Romans as Tusci. They are\r\nusually called Etruscans, and their name still survives in that of\r\nTuscany. They are thought by some to have been Keltic, but their tongue\r\nis not sufficiently construed to afford proof, and their whole history\r\nis lost. Their religion and habits were unlike those of their Roman\r\nneighbours, and they were in a far more advanced state of civilization.\r\nIn the time of Tarquinius Priscus they obtained considerable influence\r\nover Rome, many of whose noblest works were Etruscan; and though this\r\npower was lost in the time of Tarquinius Superbus, and long wars were\r\nwaged between Rome and Etruria, the effects of their intercourse lasted,\r\nand many institutions were traceable to the Etruscan element. Of the\r\nRoman families, some considered themselves descended from different\r\nLatin tribes, others from Sabines, others from Etruscans; and their\r\ngenealogy was carefully observed, as their political position depended\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nTheir nomenclature was, in fact, the immediate parent of our own.\r\n\r\nEvery Roman citizen had necessarily two names. The second of these was\r\nthe important one which marked his hereditary position in the state, and\r\nanswered to our surname. It was called the _nomen_, or name, _par\r\nexcellence_, and was inherited from his father, belonging also to the\r\nentire _gens_, or tribe, who considered themselves to have a common\r\nancestor, and who, all alike, whether wealthy or otherwise, took the\r\nrank of their gens, whether patrician, equitial, or plebeian. The\r\ndaughters of the gens were called by the feminine of its name, and\r\nsometimes took that of the gens of their husband, but this was not\r\nalways the custom.\r\n\r\nBesides these large tribes, there were lesser ones of families. If an\r\nancestor had acquired an additional appellation, whether honourable or\r\nludicrous, it passed to all his male descendants, thus distinguishing\r\nthem from the rest of their gens, and was called the cognomen. For\r\ninstance, after Marcus Manlius had saved the capitol, Capitolinus would\r\nbe the cognomen not merely of himself but of his posterity.\r\n\r\nClients and freedmen took the gentile name of their patron, and when the\r\nfreedom of Rome was granted to a stranger, he took the gentile name of\r\nhim from whom it was received, thus infinitely spreading the more\r\ndistinguished nomina of the later republic and early empire, and in the\r\nRomanized countries gradually becoming the modern hereditary surname,\r\nthe convenience of the family distinction causing it to be gradually\r\nadopted by the rest of the world. When the last of a gens adopted the\r\nson of another clan to continue his line, the youth received the nomen\r\nand one or more cognomina of his new gens, but brought in that of his\r\nold one with the augmentative _anus_. As for instance, Publius Æmilius\r\nPaullus being adopted by Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, became\r\nPublius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Æmilianus, and his daughter was\r\nsimply Cornelia. Again, Caius Octavius, as adopted into the Julian gens,\r\nbecame Caius Julius Cæsar Octavius; and the emperors being all adopted,\r\narrived at such a multitude of names that the accumulation was entirely\r\nuseless, and they were called by a single one.\r\n\r\nAdded to all these family names, each man had his own individual name,\r\nwhich was bestowed in later times, or more properly registered when, at\r\nthe age of fourteen, he laid aside the childish tunic and bulla, or\r\ngolden ball, which he had worn from infancy, put off the toga\r\nprætextala, and assumed the _toga virilis_, or manly gown, white edged\r\nwith purple, which was the regular official Roman dress. In the latter\r\ndays, the prænomen was given on the eighth day, with a lustratio or\r\nwashing of the infant. There was a very small choice of Roman prænomina,\r\nnot above seventeen; an initial was sufficient to indicate which might\r\nbe intended, nor did ladies receive their feminines in the earlier\r\ntimes. By which name a man might be called was arbitrary; the gentile\r\nname was the distinction of rank, and perhaps the most commonly used by\r\nhis acquaintance, unless the tribe were very large, when the cognomen\r\nwould be used; and among brothers the prænomen was brought in first as\r\nthe Christian name is with us. The great Marcus Tullius Cicero was\r\ncalled Cicero by those who only knew him politically, while to his\r\ncorrespondents he was Tullius; his son, of the same name, was termed\r\nMarcus Cicero; his brother, Quintus Cicero; and Caius Julius Cæsar\r\nfigures in contemporary correspondence as C. Cæsar.\r\n\r\nIn Christian times, the lustratio at the giving of the prænomen became\r\nHoly Baptism, thus making our distinction between baptismal and\r\nhereditary names. The strict adherence to the old prænomina had been\r\nalready broken into, especially in favour of women, who had found the\r\nuniversal gentile name rather confusing, and had added to it feminine\r\nprænomina or agnomina, had changed it by diminution or augmentation, or\r\nhad taken varieties from the other gentes to which they were related.\r\nChristianity had given individuality to woman, and she was no longer No.\r\n1, or No. 2, the property of the gens. Significant names, Greek names,\r\nor saintly ones were chosen as prænomina, and the true Christian name\r\ngrew up from the old Roman seventeen. Besides these, the numerous\r\nslaves, who formed a large part of the Roman population, had each a\r\nsingle name. Some of these were in their own language, disguised by\r\nLatin pronunciation; others were called by Greek or Latin words; others\r\nbore their masters' names. Many of these slaves were among the martyrs\r\nof the Church, and their names were bestowed on many an infant\r\nChristian. Others were afterwards formed from significant Latin words,\r\nbut far fewer than from Greek words, the rigid hereditary customs of\r\nLatin nomencloture long interfering with the vagaries of invention, and\r\nmost of these later not being far removed from classical Latinity.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the original Latin word, especially if\r\ndescriptive or adjectival, usually ends in _us_, representing the Greek\r\nος, and in the oblique cases becoming _i_ and _o_—in the vocative _e_.\r\nWhen it was meant to signify one of or belonging to this first, the\r\ntermination was _ius_—thus from Tullus comes one belonging to\r\nTullus—Tullius, in the vocative _i_; and again, one of the gens adopted\r\ninto another, would become Tullianus,—Tullus, Tullius, Tullianus. The\r\ndiminutive would be _illus_, or _iolus_, and in time became a separate\r\nname: Marcus, Marcius, Marcianus, Marcellus. In the adoption of Latin by\r\nthe barbarous nations, the language was spoken without the least\r\nattention to declension; the Italians and Spanish used only the dative\r\ntermination, making all their words end in _o_; but the former\r\npreserving the nominative plural _i_, and the latter the accusative\r\nplural _os_, while the French stopped short at the simple elementary\r\nword, and while finishing it in writing with an _e_, discarded all\r\npronunciation of its termination. The vocative was their favourite case\r\nin pronunciation, and has passed to us in our usual terminal _y_. The\r\n_a_ of feminine names was retained by Italy and Spain; cut off by\r\nFrance, Germany, and England.[51]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Niebuhr, _Rome_; Arnold, _Rome_; Smith, _Dictionary of Greek and Roman\r\n  Antiquities_; Max Müller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                            LATIN PRÆNOMINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SECTION I.—_Aulus, Caius, Cnæus, Cæso._\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenient classification, it may be best to begin the\r\nLatin names with the original prænomina and their derivatives, few in\r\nnumber as they are, and their origin involved in the dark antiquity of\r\nthe Roman pre-historic times. The chief light thrown upon them is in a\r\nwork entitled _De Factis Dictisque Memorabilibus_, compiled by one\r\nMarcus Valerius Maximus, in the Augustan age, to which is appended a\r\ndissertation on Roman prænomina of doubtful authorship; but whether this\r\nbe by Valerius himself, or by his abridger and imitator, it is the\r\nearliest information we possess as to these home appellations of the\r\nstern conquerors of the world.\r\n\r\nCaius, or Caiius as the elders spelt it, was one of the most common of\r\nall Roman prænomina, and was pronounced Gaius, as it is written in St.\r\nPaul’s mention of “Gaius mine host.” Men indicated it by the initial C;\r\nwomen who bore it, used the same C reversed (ↄ) on coins or\r\ninscriptions. Valerius, or his imitator, deduces it from _gaudium\r\nparentum_, the parents' joy, but it is more probably from the root-word\r\n_gai_. When a Roman marriage took place with the full ceremonies such as\r\nrendered divorce impossible, the names Caius and Caia always stood for\r\nthose of the married pair in the formulary of prayer uttered over them\r\nwhile they sat on two chairs with the skin of the sheep newly sacrificed\r\nspread over their heads; and when the bride was conducted to her\r\nhusband’s house, spindle and distaff in hand, she was demanded who she\r\nwas, and replied, “Where thou art Caius, I am Caia;” and having owned\r\nherself his feminine, she was carried over his threshold, to prevent the\r\nill omen of touching it with her foot, and set down on a sheepskin\r\nwithin. From this rite all brides were called Caiæ. It is said that it\r\nwas in honour of Tanaquil, whose Roman name was Caia Cæcilia, and who\r\nwas supposed to be the model Roman woman, fulfilling the epitome of\r\nduties expressed in the pithy saying, _Domum mansit, lanam fecit_ (she\r\nstaid at home and spun wool), and was therefore worshipped by Roman\r\nmaids and matrons. The Romans introduced Caius into Britain, and the Sir\r\nKay, seneschal of Arthur’s court, who appears in the romances of the\r\nRound Table, was probably taken from a British Caius; but the Highland\r\nclan, Mackay, are not sons of Caius, but of Ey.\r\n\r\nIt was probably from a word of the same source, that the Italian town\r\nand promontory of Caieta were so called, though the Romans believed the\r\nname to be taken from Caieta, the nurse of Æneas, a dame who only\r\nappears among Latin authors. The city has become Gaeta in modern\r\npronunciation, and from it has arisen the present Italian Gaetano. Who\r\nfirst was thus christened does not appear, but the popularity of the\r\nname began on the canonization of Gaetano di Thienna, a Vicentine noble\r\nand monk, who, in 1524, instituted the Theatine order of monks. He\r\nhimself had been called after an uncle, a canon of Padua, learned in the\r\nlaw; but I cannot trace Gaetano back any further. It is in right of this\r\nsaint, however, that it has become a great favourite in Italy. The\r\nPortuguese call it Caetano, the Spaniards, Cajetano; the Slavonians (who\r\nmust have it through Venice), Kajetan or Gajo. It was a family name in\r\nDante’s time, and his contemporary, Pope Boniface VIII., of whom he\r\nspeaks with some scorn, had been Benedetto Gaëtano.[52]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Welsh.     │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Lucy           │Lleulu         │Lucie          │Lucia          │\r\n   │Luce           │               │Luce           │Luzia          │\r\n   │Lucinda        │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │  Hungarian.   │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Luzija         │Lucya          │Lucza          │Lucia          │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Diefenbach, _Celtica_; Butler; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Lucius._\r\n\r\n_Lux_ (light) gave the very favourite prænomen Lucius, one born at\r\ndaylight, or, as some say, with a fair complexion. Many an L at the\r\nopening of a Roman inscription attests the frequency of this name, which\r\nseems first to have come into Rome with the semi-mythical Lucius\r\nTarquinius Priscus, and was derived from his family by the first Brutus.\r\nThe feminine Lucia belonged to a virgin martyr of Syracuse, whose name\r\nof light being indicated by early painters by a lamp or by an eye, led\r\nto the legend that her beautiful eyes had been put out.\r\n\r\nThe Sicilian saints were, as has been already said, particularly\r\npopular, and Santa Lucia is not only the patroness of the Italian\r\nfishermen, and the namesake of their daughters, but she was early\r\nadopted by the Normans; and even in the time of Edward the Confessor,\r\nthe daughter of the Earl of Mercia had been thus baptized, unless indeed\r\nher husband, Ivo Taillebois, translated something English into Lucia.\r\nThe house of Blois were importers of saintly names, and Lucie, a sister\r\nof Stephen, was among those lost in the White Ship. The name has ever\r\nsince flourished, both in England and France, but was most popular in\r\nthe former during the seventeenth century, when many noble ladies were\r\ncalled Lucy, but poetry chose to celebrate them as Lucinda, or by some\r\nother fashionable variety of this sweet and simple word.\r\n\r\nThe lady has here had the precedence, because of her far greater\r\npopularity, but the masculine is also interesting to us. The root _luc_\r\n(light) is common to all the Indo-European languages; and ancient\r\nBritain is said to have had a king called Lleurwg ap Coel ap Cyllin, or\r\nLlewfer Mawr (the Great Light), who was the first to invite teachers of\r\nthe Gospel to his country. He is Latinized into Lucius, and this word\r\nhas again furnished the Welsh Lles. Nothing can be more apocryphal than\r\nthe whole story, but it probably accounts for the use of Lucius amongst\r\nEnglishmen just after the Reformation, when there was a strong desire\r\namong them to prove the conversion of their country to be anterior to\r\nthe mission of Augustine. Named at this time, Lucius Cary, Viscount\r\nFalkland, rendered the sound honourable, though it has not become\r\ncommon. Lucio, or Luzio, is hereditary in Italy. The Irish Lucius is the\r\nequivalent of the native Lachtna and Loiseach.\r\n\r\nThe Lucillian gens of the plebeian order was formed from Lucius, and\r\nthence arose Lucilla, borne by several Roman empresses, and by a local\r\nsaint at Florence; and in later times considered as another diminutive\r\nof Lucy.\r\n\r\nLucianus, on the other hand, was a derivative, and having belonged to\r\nseveral saints, continued in use in Italy as Luciano or Luziano, whence\r\nLucien the Buonaparte derived the appellation, so plainly marking him,\r\nlike his brother, as an Italian Frenchified.\r\n\r\nLuciana has continued likewise in Italy, and was anciently Lucienne in\r\nFrance. Perhaps the English Lucy Anne may be an imitation of it.\r\n\r\nLucianus contracted into Lucanus as a cognomen, and thus was named the\r\nSpanish poet, Marcus Annæus Lucanus, usually called in English Lucan;\r\nbut it has a far nearer interest to us. Cognomina in _anus_, contracted\r\ninto the Greek ας, were frequently bestowed on slaves or freed-men,\r\nespecially of Greek extraction. These were often highly educated, and\r\nwere the librarians, secretaries, artists, and physicians of their\r\nmasters, persons of Jewish birth being especially employed in the\r\nlast-mentioned capacity. Thus does the third Evangelist, the beloved\r\nphysician and reputed painter, bear in his name evidence of being a\r\nGreek-speaking protégé of a Roman house, Λουκας (Lukas) being the Greek\r\ncontraction of Lucanus or Lucianus. “His sound hath gone out into all\r\nlands,” and each pronounces his name in its own fashion; but he is less\r\npopular as a patron than his brethren, though more so in Italy than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │               │               │               │  Spanish and  │\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │Luke           │Luc            │Luca           │Lucas          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Russian.    │  Wallachian.  │   Bohemian.   │\r\n   │Lukas          │Luka           │Luka           │Lukas          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Slavonic.   │   Lusatian.   │  Hungarian.   │               │\r\n   │Lukash         │Lukash         │Lukacz         │               │\r\n   │               │Lukaschk       │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nLucretius, the name of a noted old gens, is probably from the same\r\nsource, though some take it from _lucrum_ (gain). “Lucrece, combing the\r\nfleece under the midnight lamp,” that fine characteristic Roman tale,\r\nfurnished Shakespeare with an early poem; and Lucrezia was one of the\r\nfirst classic names revived by the Italians; and though borne by the\r\nnotorious daughter of the Borgia, has continued fashionable with them\r\nand with the French, who make it Lucrèce; while we have now and then a\r\nLucretia, learnt probably from the fanciful designations of the taste of\r\nthe eighteenth century.[53]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Butler; Kitto; Jameson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION III.—_Marcus._\r\n\r\nThe origin of Marcus, represented by the _M_, so often a Roman initial,\r\nis involved in great doubt. It has been deduced from the Greek μαλακὸς\r\n(soft or tender), a very uncongenial epithet for one of the race of\r\niron. Others derive it from _mas_ (a male), as implying manly qualities;\r\nand others, from Mars, or more correctly, Mavers or Mamers, one of the\r\nchief of the old Latin deities. Diefenbach thinks also that it may be\r\nconnected with the Keltic Marc (a horse), and with the verb to march.\r\n\r\nIt extended into all the provinces, and was that by which John, sister’s\r\nson to Barnabas, was known to the Romans. Tradition identifies him with\r\nthe Evangelist, who, under St. Peter’s direction, wrote the Gospel\r\nespecially intended for “strangers of Rome,” and who afterwards founded\r\nthe Church of Alexandria, and gave it a liturgy. In consequence, Markos\r\nhas ever since been a favourite Greek name, especially among those\r\nconnected with the Alexandrian patriarchate. In the days, however, when\r\nrelic-hunting had become a passion, some adventurous Venetians stole the\r\nremains of the Evangelist from the pillar in the Alexandrian church, in\r\nwhich they had been built up, and transferred them to Venice.\r\n\r\nPopular imagination does not seem to have supposed the saints to have\r\nbeen one whit displeased at any sacrilegious robberies, for San Marco\r\nimmediately was constituted the prime patron of the city; and, having\r\nbeen supposed to give his almost visible protection in perils by fire\r\nand flood, the Republic itself and its territory were known as his\r\nproperty, and the special emblem of the state was that shape among the\r\nCherubim which had been appropriated as the token suited to his Gospel,\r\nnamely, the lion with eagle’s wings, the Marzocco, as the populace\r\ntermed it, and another such Marzocco figures at Florence.\r\n\r\nMarco was the name of every fifth man at Venice, and the winged lion\r\nbeing the stamp on the coinage of the great merchant city, which was\r\nbanker to half the world, a marc became the universal title of the piece\r\nof money which, though long disused in England, has left traces of its\r\nvalue in the legal fee of six-and-eightpence.\r\n\r\nThe chief popularity of the Evangelist’s name is in Italy, especially\r\nLombardy; though the Greek Church, as in duty bound, has many a Markos,\r\nand no country has ceased to make use of it. Some, such as Niebuhr for\r\nhis Roman-born son, and a few classically inclined English, have revived\r\nthe ancient Marcus; but, in general, the word follows the national\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │  Spanish and  │\r\n   │               │               │               │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │Mark           │Marc           │Marco          │Marcos         │\r\n   │Marcus         │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │ Esthonian and │  Polish and   │   Lusatian.   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │    Russian    │   Bohemian    │               │               │\r\n   │Mark           │Marek          │Markusch       │Markus         │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nFrom Marcus sprang the nomen Martius, or, as it was later written,\r\nMarcius, belonging to a very noble gens of Sabine origin, which gave a\r\nking to Rome, and afterwards was famous in the high-spirited and\r\ngentle-hearted Cnæus Marcius Coriolanus.\r\n\r\nThe daughters of this gens were called Marcia, and this as Marzia,\r\nMarcie, Marcia, has since been used as the feminine of Mark. From\r\nMartius again came Martinus, the name of the Roman soldier who divided\r\nhis cloak with the beggar, and afterwards became Bishop of Tours, and\r\ncompleted the conversion of the Gauls. He might well be one of the\r\nfavourite saints of France, and St. Martin of Tours rivalled St. Denys\r\nin the allegiance of the French, when kings and counts esteemed it an\r\nhonour to belong to his chapter; and yet Martin occurs less frequently\r\nin French history than might have been expected, though it is to be\r\nfound a good deal among the peasants, and is a surname. Dante speaks of\r\nSer Martino as typical of the male gossips of Florence; and from the\r\ngreat prevalence of the surname of Martin in England, it would seem to\r\nhave been more often given as a baptismal name. Martin was a notable\r\nking of Aragon; but zealous Romanist countries have perhaps disused\r\nMartin for the very reason that Germans love it, namely, that it\r\nbelonged to “Dr. Martinus Luther,” as the learned would call the\r\nAugustinian monk, whose preachings opened the eyes of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Italian and  │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │               │               │   Spanish.    │               │\r\n   │Martyn         │Martin         │Martino        │Martin         │\r\n   │               │Mertin         │               │Martinho       │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Swiss.     │    Dutch.     │     Lett.     │\r\n   │Martin         │Märti          │Martijn        │Martschis      │\r\n   │Mertil         │Martili        │Marten         │   —————————   │\r\n   │               │               │   —————————   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │               │               │   Swedish.    │Martoni        │\r\n   │               │               │Marten         │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nMartina was one of the young Roman girls who endured the fiery trial of\r\nmartyrdom under the Emperor Decius. Her plant is the maidenhair fern, so\r\ngreat an ornament to the Roman fountains; and her name, whether in her\r\nhonour, or as the feminine of Martin, is occasionally found in Italy,\r\nFrance, and England.\r\n\r\nMarcianus was an augmentative of Marcus, whence Marciano or Marcian were\r\nformed. Marcellus is the diminutive, and became the cognomen of the\r\ngreat Claudian gens. Marcus Claudius Marcellus was the conqueror of\r\nSyracuse, and the last of his direct descendants is that son of Octavia\r\nand nephew of Augustus, the prediction of whose untimely death is placed\r\nby Virgil in the mouth of his forefather, Anchises, in the Elysian\r\nFields. St. Marcellus was a young Roman soldier who figures among the\r\nwarrior saints of Venice, and now and then has a French namesake called\r\nMarcel.\r\n\r\nMarcella was a pious widow, whose name becoming known through her\r\nfriendship with St. Jerome, took the fancy of the French; and Marcelle\r\nhas never been uncommon among them, nor Marcella in Ireland.\r\n\r\nMarcellianus, another derivative from Marcellus, was the name of an\r\nearly pope, whence Marcellin is common in France.\r\n\r\nFrom Mars again came Marius, the fierce old warrior of terrible memory;\r\nbut who, in the form of Mario, is supposed by the Italians to be the\r\nmasculine of Maria, and used accordingly.[54]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Diefenbach; Roscoe, _History of Venice_; Grimm; _Transactions\r\n  of Philological Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION IV.—_Posthumus, &c._\r\n\r\nPosthumus is generally explained as meaning a posthumous son, from\r\n_post_ (after) and _humus_ (ground); born after his father was\r\nunderground; but there is reason to think that it is, in fact, Postumus,\r\na superlative adjective, formed from _post_, and merely signifying\r\nlatest; so that it originally belonged to the son of old age, the last\r\nborn of the family. It became a frequent prænomen by imitation, and in\r\nseveral Roman families was taken as a cognomen.\r\n\r\nThe pseudo Valerius Maximus derives Titus from the Sabine Titurius;\r\nothers make it come from the Greek τίω (to honour), others from _tutus_\r\n(safe), the participle of _tueor_ (to defend). It was one of the most\r\ncommon prænomina from the earliest times, and belonged to both father\r\nand son of the two emperors connected with the fall of Jerusalem. Both\r\nwere Titus Flavius Sabinus Vespasianus, but the elder is known to us by\r\nhis cognomen, the younger by his prænomen. Titus should have been a more\r\nusual Christian name in honour of the first Bishop of Crete, but it has\r\nhardly survived, except in an occasional Italian Tito; and here Dr.\r\nTitus Oates gave it an unenviable celebrity. Tita is also sometimes used\r\nin Italy. The historian, Titus Livius, has been famous enough to have\r\nhis name much maltreated, we calling him Livy, the French Tite Live.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION V.—_Numeral Names._\r\n\r\nThus far and no farther went Latin invention for at least seven hundred\r\nyears in the way of individual domestic names. Beyond these ten, the\r\nRomans had, with a very few exceptions, peculiar to certain families,\r\nnothing but numerals for their sons; some of which became names of note\r\nfrom various circumstances. The words, though not often the names, have\r\ndescended into almost all our modern tongues.\r\n\r\nPrimus, the superlative of _præ_ (before), _præ_, _prior_, _primus_, was\r\nonly used as a slave’s name, or to distinguish some person of an elder\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n_Sequor_ (to follow) gave Secundus; the feminine of which fell sometimes\r\nto the share of daughter No. 2, to distinguish her from the elder\r\nsister, who was called by the family name. Men only had it as a\r\ncognomen, and that only in the later times. It has passed into our own\r\ntongue as well as into the more direct progeny of Latin, but Germany\r\nholds out against it. Rome likewise used Secundus in the sense of\r\nfavourable, much as we speak of seconding in parliamentary language. St.\r\nSecundinus was a companion of St. Patrick, called by the Irish St.\r\nSeachnall. His disciples were christened Maol Seachlain, pupils of St.\r\nSecundinus, a name since turned into Malachi. King Malachi with the\r\ncollar of gold, is truly the shaveling of the lesser follower.\r\n\r\nTertius barely occurs as a Roman name; but Tertia was rather more common\r\nthan Secunda, and by way of endearment was called Tertulla. From this\r\ndiminutive arose Tertullus and Tertullianus.\r\n\r\nThe next number is identical in all the tongues, though a most curious\r\ninstance of varied pronunciation. The _quadra_, or four equal-sided\r\nQuartus, only occurs once in St. Paul’s writings, and so far as we know,\r\nnowhere else. Quadratus and Quartinus were late nomina.\r\n\r\nWhy Quintus should have been so much more prevalent with the Romans than\r\nthe earlier numerals does not appear, but it was one of the commonest\r\nprænomina, and was always indicated by the initial _Q_; while the Greeks\r\ncalled it Κοίντος. Thence came the Quintian, or Quinctian, gens, an\r\nAlban family removed by Tullus Hostilius to Rome, so plain and stern in\r\nmanners that even their women wore no gold, and principally illustrious\r\nin the person of Cæso Quinctius Cincinnatus. An obscure family named\r\nQuintianus sprung again from this gens, and in time gave its name to one\r\nof the missionary martyrs of Gaul, who, in 287, was put to death at\r\nAugusta Veromanduorum on the Somme. His corpse being discovered in 641,\r\nthe great goldsmith bishop of Noyon, St. Eloi, made for it a magnificent\r\nshrine, and built over it a church, whence the town took the name of St.\r\nQuentin, and Quentin became prevalent in the neighbourhood. It was also\r\npopular in Scotland and Ireland, but it is there intended to represent\r\nCu-mhaighe (hound of the plain), pronounced Cooey. From the diminutive\r\nof the Quinctian gens came Quintilius, and thence again Quintilianus,\r\nthe most noted Roman rhetorician. Pontius is thought to be the Samnite\r\nor Oscan word for fifth, related to the Greek _pente_, and Keltic\r\n_pump_, five. It was an old nomen among those fierce Italians, and\r\nbelonged to the sage who gave the wise advice against either sparing or\r\ninjuring by halves, the Romans at the Caudine Forks. Pontius Pilatus\r\nshould, it would seem, have brought it into universal hatred, but it\r\nprobably had previously become hereditary in Spain as Ponce, whence\r\nsprang the noble family of Ponce de Leon; the French had Pons; and the\r\nItalians, Ponzio, and our _Punch_ is by some said to be another form. It\r\nmay, perhaps, come from _pons_ (a bridge).\r\n\r\nSextus was the prænomen of the hateful son of Tarquinius Superbus, but\r\nafter him it was disused, although thence arose the Sextian, Sestian,\r\nand Sextilian gentes. In later times it came again into use, and a\r\nbishop of Rome, martyred under Valerian, was named Sixtus, whence this\r\nhas grown to be one of the papal adopted names, and is called by the\r\nItalians Sisto, whence the Sistine chapel takes its name, and the\r\nDresden Madonna of Raffaelle is called di San Sisto, from the\r\nintroduction of one of the three sainted popes so termed. The French\r\nused to call these saints Xiste.\r\n\r\nThe Latin _septem_ gave Septimus, a name exceptionally used among them,\r\nas it is among us, for a seventh son.\r\n\r\nSome unknown Octavus (the eighth) probably founded the Octavian gens,\r\nwhich had only been of note in Rome for 200 years before Caius Octavius\r\nRufus married Julia, the sister of Cæsar, and their son Caius, being\r\nadopted as heir of the Julian line, became C. Julius Cæsar Octavianus,\r\nthough he afterwards merged this unwieldy title in that of Augustus.\r\nOctavius gained a certain renown through him, and Ottavio has passed on\r\nin Italy, while eighth sons are perhaps most usually named Octavius. The\r\ngentle Octavia, his sister, the most loveable of matrons, has made\r\nOttavia an Italian name, and Octavie is one adopted by modern French\r\ntaste. October is the eighth month in all modern tongues.\r\n\r\nNonnus, from _nonus_, the ninth, is not known as a name till very late,\r\nwhen Latin and Greek names were intermixed. Then it belonged to a poet,\r\nat first heathen, afterwards Christian. Nonna was the name to that\r\nfemale slave who wrought the conversion of Georgia to Christianity, and\r\n(we believe) has there been continued; and in Rome Nonnius and Nonianus\r\noccur in later times as gentile appellations. Nona has been bestowed in\r\nEngland upon that rare personage a ninth daughter. November again bears\r\ntraces of its having been the ninth month of the Romans, as does\r\nDecember of the tenth.\r\n\r\nDecimus was a prænomen in the family of Junius Brutus, inherited mayhap\r\nfrom a tenth son, and it was at Decimus Brutus that Cæsar’s dying\r\nreproach, _Et tu Brute_, is thought to have been levelled. Decimus and\r\nDecima are now and then to be found among us in unusually large families\r\nof one sex. Decius was the name of a great plebeian gens, one of the\r\noldest in Rome, and illustrated by the self-devotion of Decius Mus.[55]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  Clark, _Handbook of Comparative Grammar_; Liddell and Scott;\r\n  Facciolati; Junius; Smith; _Publications of the Irish Society_;\r\n  Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                                NOMINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION I.—_Attius._\r\n\r\nThe Latin nomina were those that came by inheritance, and denoted the\r\nposition of the gens in the state, its antiquity, and sometimes its\r\norigin. Their derivation is often, however, more difficult to trace than\r\nthat of any other names, being lost in the darkness of the Oscan and\r\nLatin dialects; and in the latter times they were very wide-spread,\r\nbeing adopted by wholesale by persons who received the franchise, as\r\nRoman citizens, from the individual who conferred it; and after the time\r\nof Caracalla, A.D. 212, when all the free inhabitants of the empire\r\nbecame alike Roman citizens, any person might adopt whatever name he\r\nchose, or even change his own if he disliked it. The feminine of this\r\ngentile name, as it was called, was the inheritance of the daughters;\r\nand on marriage, the feminine of the husband’s nomen was sometimes,\r\nthough not uniformly, assumed.\r\n\r\nThese names are here placed in alphabetical order, as there seems to be\r\nnothing else to determine their position, and it is in accordance with\r\nthe rigid Roman fashion of regularity.\r\n\r\nThus we begin with the Accian, Attian, or Actian gens; one of no great\r\nrank, but interesting as having been fixed on by tradition as the\r\nancestry of the great mountain lords of Este, who were the parents of\r\nthe house of Ferarra in Italy, and of the house of Brunswick, which has\r\ngiven six sovereigns to Britain. Accius is probably derived from Acca,\r\nthe mother of the Lares, an old Italian goddess, afterwards turned into\r\nthe nurse of Romulus. Valerius, however, deduces both it and Appius from\r\na forgotten Sabine prænomen Attus. The Appian gens was not a creditable\r\none; but Appia was sometimes the name of mediæval Roman dames.\r\n\r\nThe genealogists of the house of Este say that Marcus Actius married\r\nJulia, sister of the great Cæsar, and trace their line downwards till\r\nmodernized pronunciation had made the sound Azzo.\r\n\r\nHim whom they count as Azo I. of Este was born in 450, and from him and\r\nhis descendants Azzo and Azzolino were long common in Italy, though now\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Æmilius._\r\n\r\nAlmost inextricable confusion attends the development of the title of\r\none of the oldest and most respectable of the plebeian gentes, namely\r\nthe Æmilian, anciently written Aimilian. The family was Sabine, and the\r\nword is, therefore, probably Oscan; but the bearers were by no means\r\nagreed upon its origin, some declaring that it was αἵμυλος (flattering\r\nor witty), and called it a surname of their founder, Mamercus, whom some\r\ncalled the son of Pythagoras, others of Numa. The later Æmilii, again,\r\nclaimed to descend from Aemylos, a son of Ascanius; and others of them,\r\nless aspiring, contented themselves with Amulius, the granduncle of\r\nRomulus. Can this most intangible Amulius be, after all, a remnant of\r\nthe Teutonic element in the Roman race, and be the same with the\r\nmythical Amal, whence the Gothic Amaler traced their descent? It is\r\ncurious that _maal_ or _âmal_ means _work_ in Hebrew, while _aml_ is\r\nwork, likewise, in old Norse, as our _moil_ is in English, though in\r\nSanscrit _amala_ is spotless. Altogether, it seems most probable that\r\nthe word _mal_ (a spot or stroke) may underlie all these forms, just as\r\nit does the German _mal_ (time); that Amal was, in truth, the dimly\r\nremembered forefather; and that thus the proud Æmilii of Rome, and the\r\nwild Amaler of the forests, bore in their designations the tokens of a\r\ncommon stock.\r\n\r\nSeveral obscure saints bore the name of Æmilius or Æmilianus; and Emilij\r\nhas always been a prevailing masculine name in Russia. In Spain, a\r\nhermit, Saint Æmilianus, is always known as St. Milhan. Emilio was of\r\nold-standing in Italy; but the great prevalence in France of Émile, of\r\nlate, was owing to Rousseau’s educational work, the hero of which had\r\nnumerous namesakes among the children born in the years preceding the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe feminine had been forgotten until Boccaccio wrote his _Teseide_, and\r\ncalled the heroine Emilia. It was at once translated or imitated in all\r\nlanguages, and became mixed up with the Amalie already existing in\r\nGermany. Amalie of Mansfeld lived in 1493; Amalie of Wurtemburg, in\r\n1550; and thence the name spread throughout Germany, whence the daughter\r\nof George II. brought it to England, and though she wrote herself\r\nAmelia, was called Princess Emily. Both forms are recognized in most\r\nEuropean countries, though often confounded together, and still worse,\r\nwith Amy and Emma.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Slovak.   │ Lusatian.  │\r\n   │Emily       │Émilie      │Emilia      │Emilija     │Mila        │\r\n   │Emilia      │            │            │Milica      │Milka       │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION III.—_Antonius._\r\n\r\nTwo gentes were called Antonius, a word that is not easy to trace. Some\r\nexplain it as inestimable, but the Triumvir himself chose to deduce it\r\nfrom Antius, a son of Hercules. One of these clans was patrician, with\r\nthe cognomen Merenda; the other plebeian, without any third name, and it\r\nwas to the latter that the avenger of Cæsar and lover of Cleopatra\r\nbelonged—Mark Anthony, Marc Antoine, or Marcantonio, as modern tongues\r\nhave clipped his Marcus Antonius. The clipping had, however, been\r\nalready performed before the resuscitation of his evil fame in the\r\nfifteenth century, for both his names had become separately saintly, and\r\ntherefore mutilated; Mark in the person of the Evangelist, Antonius in\r\nthat of the great hermit of the fourth century—the first to practise the\r\nasceticism which resulted in the monastic system. Of Egyptian birth, his\r\ndevotions, his privations, and his conflicts with Satan, were equally\r\nadmired in the Eastern and Western Churches, and Antonios has been as\r\ncommon among the Greeks as Antonius among the Latin Christians.\r\n\r\nSt. Antony was already very popular when St. Antonio of Padua further\r\nincreased the Italian devotion to the name, and Antonio has ever since\r\nbeen exceedingly common in Italy and Spain. Classical pedantry made\r\nAntonio Paleario turn it into Aonio in honour of the Aonian choir; but\r\nwhatever he chose to call himself he made glorious by his life and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch seem to have needlessly added the silent _h_, and we probably\r\nlearnt it from them. The popularity of Antony has much diminished since\r\nthe Reformation in England, where perhaps it is less used than in any\r\nother country.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Antony         │Antoine        │Antoni         │Antonio        │\r\n   │Anthony        │               │               │Tonio          │\r\n   │Tony           │               │               │Tonetto        │\r\n   │Antholin       │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Frisian.    │    Dutch.     │    Swiss.     │\r\n   │Antonius       │Tönnes         │Anthonius      │Antoni         │\r\n   │Tenton         │Tonjes         │Theunis        │Toni           │\r\n   │Tony           │               │Toontje        │               │\r\n   │               │               │Tool           │               │\r\n   │               │               │Antoonije      │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │    Slovak.    │   Servian.    │\r\n   │Antonij        │Antoni         │Anton          │Antun          │\r\n   │Anton          │Antek          │Tone           │Antonija       │\r\n   │               │Antos          │Tonek          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Anto           │Antons         │Tönnis         │Antal          │\r\n   │Hanto          │Tennis         │Tonnio         │               │\r\n   │Tonisch        │Tanne          │               │               │\r\n   │Tonk           │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe feminine form, Antonia, is very common in Italy and Spain.

The\r\nAurelian gens was old and noble, and an Aurelia was the mother of Julius\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION IV.—_Cæcilius._\r\n\r\nThe most obvious origin of the nomen of the great Cæcilian gens would be\r\n_cæcus_ (blind); in fact _Cæcilia_ means a slow-worm, as that reptile\r\nwas supposed to be blind; but the Cæcilii would by no means condescend\r\nto the blind or small-eyed ancestor; and while some of them declared\r\nthat they were the sons of Cæcas, a companion of Æneas, others traced\r\ntheir source to the founder of Præneste, the son of Vulcan, Cæculus, who\r\nwas found beside a hearth, and called from _caleo_ (to heat), the same\r\nwith καίω (to burn). There was a large gens of this name, famous and\r\nhonourable, though plebeian; but rather remarkably, the feminine form\r\nhas always been of more note than the masculine. As has been before\r\nsaid, Caia Cæcilia is said to have been the real name of Tanaquil, the\r\nmodel Roman matron, patroness of all other married dames; and who has\r\nnot heard of the tomb of Cæcilia Metella? But the love and honour of the\r\nRoman ladies has passed on to another Cæcilia, a Christian of the days\r\nof Alexander Severus, a wife, though vowed to virginity, and a martyr\r\nsinging hymns to the last. Her corpse was disinterred in a perfect state\r\ntwo hundred years after, when it was enshrined in a church built over\r\nher own house, which gives a title to a cardinal. A thousand years\r\nsubsequently, in 1599, her sarcophagus was again opened, and a statue\r\nmade exactly imitating the lovely, easy, and graceful position in which\r\nthe limbs remained.\r\n\r\nThis second visit to her remains was not, however, needed to establish\r\nher popularity. She is as favourite a saint with the Roman matrons as is\r\nSt. Agnes with their daughters; and the fact of her having sung till her\r\nlast breath, established her connection with music. An instrument became\r\nher distinguishing mark; and as this was generally a small organ, she\r\ngot the credit of having invented it, and became the patroness of music\r\nand poetry, as St. Katharine of eloquence and literature, and St.\r\nBarbara of architecture and art. Her day was celebrated by especial\r\nmusical performances; even in the eighteenth century an ode on St.\r\nCecilia’s day was a special occasion for the laudation of music; and\r\nDryden and Pope have fixed it in our minds, by their praises, not so\r\nmuch of Cecilia, as of Timotheus and Orpheus. Already, in the eleventh\r\ncentury, the musical saint had been given as a patroness; and the\r\ncontemporaries, Philip I. of France, and William I. of England, had each\r\na daughter Cécile.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, Cécile in France was only less popular than the English\r\nCicely was with all ranks before the Reformation. Cicely Neville, the\r\nRose of Raby, afterwards Duchess of York, called “Proud Cis,” gave it\r\nthe chief note in England; but her princess grandchild, Cicely\r\nPlantagenet, was a nun, and thus did not transmit it to any noble\r\nfamily. After the Reformation, Cicely sank to the level of “stammel\r\nwaistcoat,” and was the milkmaid’s generic name. And so the gentlewomen\r\nwho had inherited Cicely from their grandmothers, were ashamed of it;\r\nand it became Cecilia, until the present reaction against fine names\r\nsetting in, brought them back to Cecil and Cecily. In Ireland, the\r\nNorman settlers introduced it, and it became Sighile.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Cecilia        │Cécile         │Cecilia        │Cacilia        │\r\n   │Cecily         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Cicely         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Cecil          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Sisley         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Sis            │               │               │               │\r\n   │Sissot         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Cis            │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Hamburg.    │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Cile           │Zezilija       │Cecylia        │Cecilia        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Cecilija       │\r\n   │               │               │               │Cila           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Cilika         │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nSessylt, the British form of the masculine, lasted on long in Wales; and\r\nthe Italians kept up Cecilio.

He preached in Germany, and was martyred at Wurtzburg; and\r\nhis name has never quite ceased to be used in the adjacent lands.[56]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Facciolati; Smith; Valerius Maximus; Butler; Jameson; Michaelis; Pott.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION V.—_Cœlius._\r\n\r\nCœles Vivenna, an Etruscan general, named the Cœlian hill, and the\r\nCœlian gens, whence the Italians have continued Celio and Celia. In\r\nVenice the latter becomes Zilia and Ziliola, and is often to be found\r\nbelonging to noble ladies and the wives of doges. At Naples it was\r\nLiliola, and it seems to be the true origin of Lilian and Lilias. The\r\nIrish, too, have adopted it as Sile, or Sheelah, and Célie and Celia\r\nhave been occasionally adopted by both French and English, under some\r\nmisty notion of a connection with _cœlum_ (heaven). The prevalence of\r\nCelia among the lower classes in English towns is partly owing to the\r\nIrish Sheelah, partly to some confusion with Cecilia.\r\n\r\nCœlina was a virgin of Meaux, converted to a holy life by St. Geneviève.\r\nShe is the origin of the French Céline, who probably suggested the\r\nEnglish Selina, though, as we spell this last, we refer it to the Greek\r\nSelene (the moon).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VI.—_Claudius._\r\n\r\nAnother personal defect, namely lameness, probably was the source of the\r\nappellation of the Claudian gens, although by some the adjective\r\n_claudus_ is rejected in favour of the old verb _clueo_, from the same\r\nroot as the Greek _kleo_, I hear, and _kluo_, I am called, or I am\r\nfamous, meaning to be called, _i. e._, famed. The Claudii were a family\r\nof evil fame, with all the darker characteristics of the Roman, and they\r\nfigure in most of the tragedies of the city. They were especially proud\r\nand stern, and never adopted any one into their family till the Emperor\r\nClaudius adopted Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who did not improve the\r\nfame of the Claudian surname of Nero. But the reign of the Emperor\r\nClaudius and the number of his freedmen, and new citizens, gave his\r\ngentile name an extensive vogue, and from his conquests in Britain was\r\nthere much adopted. Besides, the Claudia who sends her greeting to St.\r\nTimothy in St. Paul’s Epistle, is believed to have been the daughter of\r\na British prince and wife of Pudens, whose name is preserved in\r\ninscriptions at Colchester.\r\n\r\nThe epigrams of Martial speak of a British lady of the same name, and\r\nthus Claudia is marked by the concurrence of two very dissimilar\r\nauthorities as one of the first British Christians, while the hereditary\r\nWelsh name of Gladys, the Cornish Gladuse, corroborate the Christian\r\nreverence for Claudia. The masculine form, Gladus, is likewise used, and\r\nin Scotland Glaud, recently softened into Claud, is not uncommon.\r\nClaudie is very common in Provence. Louis XII., who gave both his\r\ndaughters male names, called the eldest Claude, and when she was the\r\nwife of François I., la Reine Claude plums were so termed in her honour.\r\nHer daughter carried Claude into the House of Lorraine, where it again\r\nbecame masculine, and was frequent in the family of Guise. The painter\r\nGelée assumed the name of Claude de Lorraine in honour of his patrons,\r\nand thus arose all the picturesque associations conveyed by the word\r\nClaude.\r\n\r\nClaudine is a favourite female Swiss form.[57]\r\n\r\n  ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐\r\n  │ English. │ Scotch.  │ French.  │ Italian. │ Russian. │ Slovak.  │\r\n  │Claud     │Glaud     │Claude    │Claudio   │Klavdij   │Klavdi    │\r\n  │          │          │Godon     │          │  ——————  │          │\r\n  │          │          │          │          │Illyrian. │          │\r\n  │          │          │          │          │Klavdij   │          │\r\n  ├──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┤\r\n  │                            FEMININE.                            │\r\n  ├─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┤\r\n  │       French.       │       Welsh.        │      Italian.       │\r\n  │Claude               │Gladys               │Claudia              │\r\n  │Claudine             │                     │                     │\r\n  │Claudie              │                     │                     │\r\n  └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Facciolati; Smith; Rees, _Welsh Saints_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION VII.—_Cornelius, &c._\r\n\r\nThe far more honourably distinguished clan of Cornelius has no traceable\r\norigin, unless from _cornu belli_ (a war horn), but this is a suggestion\r\nof the least well-informed etymologists, and deserves no attention.\r\nScipio and Sylla were the most noted families of this gens, both\r\nmemorable for very dissimilar qualities; and Cornelia, the mother of the\r\nGracchi, inherited her name from her father, Publius Cornelius Scipio\r\nAfricanus I. The centurion of the _Italian_ band was probably a\r\nhereditary Roman Cornelius; but earliest gentile Christian though he\r\nwere, he was not canonized, and the saint of the Western Church is a\r\nmartyred Pope Cornelius of the third century, whose relics were brought\r\nto Compiègne by Charles the Bald, and placed in the Abbey of St.\r\nCorneille, whence again a portion was carried to the Chapter of Rosnay,\r\nin Flanders. This translation accounts for the popularity of both the\r\nmasculine and feminine forms in the Low Countries, in both kingdoms of\r\nwhich they constantly are found, and where Cornelius gets shortened into\r\nKees, Knelis, Nöll, or Nelle, and Cornelia into Keetje, or Kee. As an\r\nattempt to translate the native Keltic names beginning with _cu_, or\r\n_con_, Cornelius, or Corney, is one of the most frequent Irish\r\ndesignations. Nelleson is the Dutch surname, and Nelson is as likely to\r\nbe thus derived as from the northern Nielson. The Dantzic contraction is\r\nKnelz, and the Illyrians call the feminine Drenka!\r\n\r\nThe great Fabian gens was old Latin, and was said by Pliny to be so\r\ncalled from their having been the first to cultivate the bean, _faba_,\r\nwhile others say the true form was _fodius_, or _fovius_, from their\r\nhaving invented the digging of pits, _foveæ_, for wolves, a proceeding\r\nrather in character with the wary patient disposition displayed by the\r\ngreatest man of the race, Quintus Fabius Maximus, whose agnomen of\r\nCunctator so well describes the policy that wasted away the forces of\r\nthe Carthaginian invader. Fabio has been occasionally a modern Italian\r\nname; Fabiola is the diminutive of Fabia; Fabianus the adoptive\r\naugmentation, whence the occasional French Fabien, and, more strange to\r\nrecord, the Lithuanian Pobjus.\r\n\r\nFabricius is probably from _Faber_ (a workman), but there was no person\r\nof note of the family except Caius Fabricius Luscinus, whose interview\r\nwith Pyrrhus and his elephant has caused him to be for ever remembered.\r\nFabrizio Colonna, however, seems to be his only namesake.\r\n\r\n_Flavus_ and _Fulvus_ both mean shades of yellow, and there were both a\r\nFlavian and a Fulvian gens, no doubt from the complexion of an early\r\nancestor, Flavius being probably a yellow-haired mountaineer with\r\nnorthern blood; Fulvius a tawny Italian. It is in favour of this\r\nsupposition that Constantius, who brought the Flavian gens to the\r\nimperial throne, had the agnomen Chlorus, also expressing a light\r\ncomplexion. Out of compliment to his family the derivatives of Flavius\r\nbecame common, as Flavianus, Flavia, and Flavilla. Flavio is now and\r\nthen found in modern Italy, and Flavia figured in the poetry and essays\r\nof the last century. Fulvia, “the married woman,” as her rival Cleopatra\r\ncalls her, was the wife of Antony, and gave her name an evil fame by her\r\nusage of the head of the murdered Cicero.[58]\r\n\r\nThe Herminian gens is believed to be of Sabine origin, and its first\r\nsyllable, that lordly _herr_, which we traced in the Greek Hera and\r\nHercules, and shall find again in the German Herman. There is little\r\ndoubt that the Roman Herminius and the brave Cheruscan chief, whom he\r\ncalled Arminius, were in the same relationship as were the Emilii and\r\nAmaler.\r\n\r\nHerminius is the word that left to Italy the graceful legacy of Erminia,\r\nwhich was in vogue, by inheritance, among Italian ladies when Tasso\r\nbestowed it upon the Saracen damsel who was captured by Tancred, and\r\nfascinated by the graces of her captor. Thence the French adopted it as\r\nHermine, and it has since been incorrectly supposed to be the Italian\r\nfor Hermione; indeed, Scott indiscriminately calls the mysterious lady\r\nin George Heriot’s house Erminia or Hermione. The Welsh have obtained it\r\nlikewise, by inheritance, in the form of Ermin, which, however, they now\r\nmurder by translating it into Emma.\r\n\r\nHortensius (a gardener), from _hortus_, a garden, belonged to an\r\nhonourable old plebeian gens, and has been continued in Italy, both in\r\nthe masculine Ortensio, and feminine Ortensia, whence the French\r\nobtained their Hortense, probably from Ortensia Mancini, the niece of\r\nMazarin.\r\n\r\nThe Horatian gens was a very old and noble one, memorable for the battle\r\nof the Horatii, in the mythic times of early Rome. Some explain their\r\nnomen by _hora_ (an hour), and make it mean the punctual, but this is a\r\ntriviality suggested by the sound, and the family themselves derived it\r\nfrom the hero ancestor, Horatus, to whom an oak wood was dedicated. The\r\npoet Horace bore it as an adoptive name, being of a freedman’s family.\r\nExcept for Orazio, in Italy, the name of Titian’s son, it slept till\r\nCorneille’s tragedy of _Les Horaces_ brought it forward, and the\r\ninfluence of Orazio made it Horatio in England. Thus the brother and son\r\nof Sir Robert Walpole bore it, and the literary note of the younger\r\nHorace Walpole made it fashionable. Then came our naval hero to give it\r\nfull glory, and that last mention of his daughter Horatia seems to have\r\nbrought the feminine forward of late years. The name is not popular\r\nelsewhere, but is called by the Russians, Goratij, by the Slovaks,\r\nOrac.[59]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Butler; Facciolati; _Irish Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VIII.—_Julius._\r\n\r\n             “At puer Ascanius, cui nunc cognomen Iulo,\r\n             Additur Ilus erat dum res stetit Ilia regno.”\r\n\r\n             “The boy Ascanius, now Iulus named—\r\n             Ilus he was while Ilium’s realm still stood,”\r\n\r\nquoth Jupiter, in the first book of the _Æneid_, whence Virgil’s\r\ncommentators aver that Ascanius was at first called after Ilus, the\r\nriver that gave Troy the additional title of Ilium; but that during the\r\nconquest of Italy he was termed Iulus, from ιουλος (the first down on\r\nthe chin), because he was still beardless when he killed Mezentius. The\r\nfather of gods and men continues:\r\n\r\n          “Nascetur pulchrâ Trojanus origine Cæsar,\r\n          (Imperium Oceano, famam qui terminet astris,)\r\n          Julius, a magno nomen Iulo.”\r\n\r\n      “A Trojan, by high lineage shall arise—\r\n      Cæsar (whose conquering fame the sea and stars shall bound),\r\n      Called Julius, from Iulus, mighty name.”\r\n\r\nThe Julian gens certainly exceeded Rome in antiquity, and one of their\r\ndistinguished families bore the cognomen of Iulus; but in spite of\r\nJupiter and Virgil, Livy makes Iulus, or Ascanius, not the Trojan son of\r\nÆneas and the deserted Creusa, but the Latin son of Æneas and Lavinia,\r\nand modern etymologists hazard the conjecture that Julus may be only a\r\ndiminutive of dius (divine), since the derivation of Jupiter from Deus\r\npater (father of gods) proves that such is the tendency of the language.\r\n\r\nThe family resided at Alba Longa till the destruction of the city by\r\nTullus Hostilius, and then came to Rome, where, though of very high\r\nrank, they did not become distinguished till, once for all, their star\r\nculminated in the great Caius Julius Cæsar, after whom the Julii were\r\nonly adoptive, though Julia was the favourite name of the emperors'\r\ndaughters, and their freedmen and newly-made citizens multiplied Julius\r\nand Julianus throughout the empire.\r\n\r\nJulius was hereditary throughout the empire, and lingered on long in\r\nWales, Wallachia, and Italy. It is the most obvious source for the\r\nFrench Gilles; though, as has been already said, that word claims to be\r\nthe Greek Aigidios, and is like both the Keltic Giolla and Teutonic Gil.\r\nThe modern French Jules and English Julius were the produce of the\r\nrevived classical taste. The latter belonged to a knight whose family\r\nname was Cæsar; and Clarendon tells a story of a serious alarm being\r\nexcited in a statesman by finding a note in his pocket with the ominous\r\nwords “Remember Julius Cæsar,” which left him in dread of the ides of\r\nMarch, until he recollected that it was a friendly reminder of the\r\nhumble petition of Sir Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │English.       │Welsh.         │Breton.        │French.        │\r\n   │Julius         │Iolo           │Sulio          │Jules          │\r\n   │               │               │Iola           │Julot          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │  Spanish and  │    German.    │  Wallachian.  │\r\n   │               │  Portuguese.  │               │               │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   │Giulio         │Julio          │Julius         │Julie          │\r\n   │               │               │               │  ——————————   │\r\n   │               │               │               │   Slavonic.   │\r\n   │               │               │               │Julij          │\r\n\r\nThe feminine shared the same fate, being hereditary in Italy, and\r\nadopted as ornamental when classical names came into fashion in other\r\ncountries.

She is\r\nsaid to have been especially honoured in the Low Countries, and must\r\nlikewise have been in high favour in Normandy, perhaps through the\r\nFlemish Duchess Matilda. Julienne was in vogue among the Norman\r\nfamilies, and belonged to that illegitimate daughter of Henry I. whose\r\nchildren he so terribly maltreated in revenge for their father’s\r\nrebellion; and it long prevailed in England as Julyan: witness the\r\nheraldic and hunting prioress, Dame Julyan Berners; and, indeed, it\r\nbecame so common as Gillian, that Jill was the regular companion of\r\nJack, as still appears in nursery rhyme; though now this good old form\r\nhas almost entirely disappeared, except in the occasional un-English\r\nform of Juliana.

Jolitte was\r\nused among the French peasantry, and Giulietta in Italy, whence\r\nGiulietta Capellet appears to have been a veritable lady, whose mournful\r\nstory told in Da Porta’s novel, was adopted by Shakespeare, and rendered\r\nher name so much the property of poetry and romance, that subsequently\r\nJuliet, Juliette, and Giulietta, have been far more often christened in\r\nmemory of the impassioned girl, than of the resolute Christian\r\nmother.[60]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Michaelis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Facciolati; Michaelis; Pott; Butler; Arrowsmith, _Geography_;\r\n  Rees; Jameson; _Gesta Romanorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION IX.—_Lælius, &c._\r\n\r\nLælius, an unexplained gentile name, left to the Italians, Lelio, which\r\nwas borne by one of the heresiarchs Socini; also Lelia, in French Lélie,\r\nand sometimes confused with the names from Cœlius.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the city of Pompeii was so called from _pompa_, the\r\nsplendour or pomp with which Hercules founded it. However this might be,\r\nit is likely that from it came the nomen of the Pompeian gens, which did\r\nnot appear in Rome till a late period, and which its enemies declared\r\nwas founded by Aulus Pompeius, a flute-player. The gallant Cnæus\r\nPompeius won for himself the surname of Magnus, and made sufficient\r\nimpression on the world to have his name adapted to modern pronunciation\r\nby the Pompée of the French, and the English Pompey. When a little negro\r\nboy was the favourite appendage of fine ladies of the early seventeenth\r\ncentury, the habit of calling slaves by classical titles, made Pompey\r\nthe usual designation of these poor little fellows; from whom it\r\ndescended to little dogs, and though now out of fashion, even for them,\r\nit has obtained a set of associations that is likely to prevent that\r\nfine old Roman Pompey, surnamed the big, from obtaining any future\r\nnamesakes, except in Italy, where Pompeio has always flourished,\r\nprobably from hereditary associations.\r\n\r\nOn Roman authority, the Porcii were the breeders of _porcus_ (a pig),\r\naccording to the homely, rural, and agricultural designations of old\r\nLatinity, which to modern ears have so dignified a sound. It was the\r\nclan of the two Catones, but the masculine has not prevailed; though\r\nthat “woman well reputed, Cato’s daughter” Porcia, or, as the Italians\r\nspelt it, Porzia, caused her name to be handed on in her native land,\r\nwhere Shakespeare took it, not only for her, but for his other heroine—\r\n\r\n                                “Nothing undervalued\r\n                  To Cato’s daughter, Brutus' Portia;”\r\n\r\nfrom whom Portia, as after his example we make it, has become an\r\nexceptional fancy name. The Romans thought no scorn of the title of the\r\nunclean beast, and three families in other clans likewise bore its name,\r\nVerres, Scrofa, and Aper; the last, it is just possible, being the\r\norigin of the Sir Bors of the Round Table; in Welsh, Baez.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Sulpicius is not known. It may possibly be connected with\r\nthe obsolete word that named Sulla, from a red spotted visage; but this\r\nis uncertain. There were three saints of the name: Severus Sulpicius, a\r\nfriend of St. Martin; Sulpicius (called the severe), Bishop of Bourges,\r\nin the sixth century; and Sulpicius (called the gentle), also Bishop of\r\nBourges, in the seventh. It is an arm of this last of the three that has\r\nled to the consecration of the celebrated church at Paris, in the name\r\nof St. Sulpice. In Germany, it is Sulpiz.\r\n\r\nTerenus (soft or tender) was the origin given by the Romans to the\r\nTerentian gens, which produced Terentia, wife of Cicero, called in\r\naffection Terentilla, and likewise gave birth to the comic poet, Publius\r\nTerentius Afer, known to us as Terence, and to the Germans as Terenz. As\r\na supposed rendering of Turlough, Terence is a very favourite name in\r\nIreland, and is there called Terry, but it prevails nowhere else.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the name of Sergius is not known, but the Sergian gens\r\nwas very ancient, and believed itself to spring from the Trojans. From\r\nthem Cataline descended, and from another branch the deputy Sergius\r\nPaullus, from whom some suppose St. Paul to have taken his name.\r\n\r\nOne saint called Sergius was martyred at the city of Rasapha, in Syria;\r\nand was honoured by the change of the name of the place to Sergiopolis,\r\nin Justinian’s time. His relics are at Rome and at Prague; but a far\r\ngreater favourite as a namesake is the Russian Ssergie, who founded a\r\nmonastery near Moscow, and died there in 1292, in the highest esteem for\r\nsanctity, so that his monastery is a place of devotional pilgrimage, and\r\nSsergij or Sserezka are favourite names in Russia.[61]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Michaelis; Smith; Facciolati; Courson, _Peuples Bretons_;\r\n  Pott; Valerius Maximus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION X.—_Valerius._\r\n\r\nDeep among the roots of Indo-European tongues lies the source of our\r\nadverb _well_, the German _wohl_, Saxon _wel_, Gothic _waila_, an\r\nevidently close connection of the Latin verb _valeo_ (to be well); and\r\nwhich the Keltic _gwall_ links again with the Greek καλός (well, or\r\nbeautiful), related to the Sanscrit _kalya_ (healthy, able, or well).\r\n\r\n_Valeo_ was both to be sound and to be worth, and to the old Roman a\r\nsound man was necessarily _valiant_, worth something in the battle; and\r\n_valor_, which to them and the Italians is still value, is to the\r\nchivalrous French and English _valour_.\r\n\r\nThis word of well-being named the old Sabine Valerian gens, one of the\r\nmost noble and oldest in Rome, who had a little throne to themselves in\r\nthe Circus, and were allowed to bury their dead within the walls of the\r\ncity. The simple masculine form of the name had but two saints, and they\r\nwere too obscure to be much followed, though Valère and Valerot as\r\nsurnames have risen from it in France. The feminine of it was in honour\r\nat Rome for the sake of Valeria, the public-spirited lady who took the\r\nlead in persuading the mother of Coriolanus to intercede with her son to\r\nlay his vengeance aside and spare his mother-city; Valérie is a\r\nfavourite French name, but the compounds of this word have had far\r\ngreater note. Valerianus, the adoptive name, was borne by Publius\r\nSicinius Valerianus, that unhappy persecuting emperor who ended his\r\ncareer as a stepping-stone to Shahpoor. Saint Valerianus was Bishop of\r\nAuxerre, and though properly Valérien in French, Valerian in English,\r\nwas probably the patron of the Waleran, or Galeran, occurring in the\r\nmiddle ages, chiefly among the Luxembourgs, Counts of St. Pol.\r\n\r\nValentinianus has been continued by the Welsh in the form of Balawn.\r\n\r\nValentinus was a Roman priest, who is said to have endeavoured to give a\r\nChristian signification to the old custom of drawing lots in honour of\r\nJuno Februata, and thus fixed his own name and festival to the curious\r\nfashion prevailing all over England and France, of either the choice of\r\na “true Valentine,” or of receiving as such the first person of the\r\nopposite sex encountered on that morning.\r\n\r\nThese customs increased the popularity of Valentine and Valentina, the\r\nlatter being more probably used as the feminine of the former, than as\r\nthe name of an obscure martyr who died under Diocletian.\r\n\r\nValentina Visconti was the wife of the Duke of Orleans, brother of\r\nCharles VI. of France, and as one of the bright lights in a corrupt\r\ncourt, merited that her name should have become more permanent than it\r\nhas been.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonic contractions of the masculine are curious. Lower Lusatia\r\nmakes it Batyn, Tyno, Bal, and Balk; Lithuanian, Wallinsch; and Hungary,\r\nBalint.[62]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to separate the idea of Virginia from _virgo_ (a virgin),\r\nespecially since Sir Walter Raleigh gave that name to his American\r\ncolony in honour of the Virgin Queen, and it was probably under this\r\nimpression that Virginie was made by Bernardin de St. Pierre, the\r\nheroine of his tropical Arcadian romance, which reigned supreme over\r\nFrench, English, and German imaginations of a certain calibre, and\r\nrendered Virginie triumphant in France, and a name of sentiment in\r\nEngland. Nay, had the true Virginia lived and died a couple of centuries\r\nearlier, her story would have passed for a myth expressed in her\r\nappellation; but the fact is, that she derived it from a good old\r\nplebeian gens, who formerly spelt themselves Verginius, thus connecting\r\nthemselves with _ver_ (the spring), Persian _behar_, Eolic Βεαρ, the old\r\nGreek Γέαρ, and with all its kindred of _virga_ (a rod, or green bough),\r\n_vireo_ (to flourish), _viridis_ (green); and again with the more remote\r\ndescendants of these words in modern Europe—_vert_, _verdure_, _il\r\nvero_, &c. Virginio was a name in the Orsini family, but otherwise it\r\nhas not been kept up.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  Liddell and Scott; Pott; Facciolati; Smith; Arnold; Jones, _Welsh\r\n  Sketches_; Brand, _Popular Antiquities_; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                               COGNOMINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I.\r\n\r\nRoman cognomina were originally neither more nor less than nick-names,\r\nsometimes far from complimentary, but for the sake of convenience, or of\r\nhonourable association, continued in the family.\r\n\r\nSometimes they were adjectives, such as Asper (the rough), Cæcus (the\r\nblind), Brutus (the stupid). Sometimes they were suggested by the\r\nappearance, such as Naso (the nose), or Scævola (the left-handed), the\r\nsoubriquet earned by that Mutius who seared his right hand in the fire\r\nto prove to Porsenna what Roman constancy was. Sura (the calf of the\r\nleg), Sulla (the red-pimpled), Barbatus (the bearded), Dentatus (the\r\ntoothed), Balbus (the stammerer), and even Bibulus and Bibacula (the\r\ndrunkard).\r\n\r\nSometimes, like some of the gentle nomina previously mentioned, they\r\ncame from animal or vegetable, connected in some way with the ancestor,\r\neither by augury, chase, or culture, such as Corvinus, from _corvus_ (a\r\nraven), Buteo (a buzzard), Lentulus (a bean), Piso, from _pisum_ (a\r\npea), Cicero (a vetch), Cæpio, from _cæpe_ (an onion). Others were from\r\nthe birthplace of the forefather, such as Hadrianus, Albinus; others\r\nwere the ablative case of the name of the tribe to which the gens\r\nbelonged, as Romilia, or Palatina. Sometimes a _cognomen secundus_, or\r\nagnomen, was superadded in the case of distinguished personages, in\r\nmemory of their services, such as Coriolanus, Capitolinus, Africanus,\r\nAsiaticus. The latest example of an agnomen of victory was\r\nPeloponnesiacus, which was conferred in 1688 by the Venetian Republic\r\nupon Francesco Morosini, the conqueror of the Morea.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cognomen,—fortuitous, derisive, or honourable,—it remained\r\nattached for ever to the family, and served to designate that section of\r\nthe gens, but did not naturally descend to females; though in the latter\r\nand more irregular periods, when the gentes were so extensive that the\r\nfeminine was no distinction, they were usually assumed by the daughters\r\nof the house, and altered to suit their construction.\r\n\r\n_Ater_, black, was the source of the name of Adria in Picenum, whence\r\nwas called Adriatic Sea. A family of Ælii, migrating through Spain, were\r\nknown by the cognomen of Adrianus, or Hadrianus, both place and name\r\nbeing usually spelt with the aspirate. The Emperor Publius Ælius\r\nHadrianus built our famous northern wall, still called after him, as is\r\nthe city of Adrianople; but he failed in imposing his gentile name of\r\nÆlia upon Jerusalem. The Italian surname of Adriani is probably derived\r\nfrom the original city. An Adrianus was the first abbot of St.\r\nAugustin’s, Canterbury, and another was first bishop of Aberdeen; but\r\nthe most popular St. Adrianus was an officer in the imperial army who\r\nwas converted by the sight of the martyrdoms under Galerius, and was\r\nmartyred himself at Nicomedia, whence his relics were taken to\r\nConstantinople and to Rome, and thence again to Flanders, where they\r\nwere transported from one abbey to another, and supposed to work such\r\nmiracles that Adrianus has ever since been a universal name in the Low\r\nCountries, where it gets contracted into Arje, or Janus, while the more\r\nnortherly nations call it, in common use, Arrian, or Arne. The French\r\nmake it Adrien, and have given it the feminine Adrienne; and the\r\nItalians have not unfrequently Adriano and Adriana. In Russia it is\r\nAndreïän.\r\n\r\nAquila (an eagle) was a cognomen in several Roman families, either from\r\naugury or from the national feature. It reminds us of the Greek _Aias_,\r\nand of many of the Teuton names beginning with _ar_.\r\n\r\nAquila was a companion of St. Paul; and another Aquila, under Hadrian,\r\nwavered long between Judaism and Christianity, and translated the Old\r\nTestament into Greek; but Aquila has not been followed save here and\r\nthere in England and America as a Scripture name.\r\n\r\nAgrippa was not well understood by the Romans themselves, though they\r\nsettled that it meant one born with his feet foremost. The explanation\r\nwe quote from Professor Aufrecht: “He (Gellius) ascribes to that\r\npreposterous birth all the calamities which befell the world through\r\nAgrippa’s ill-starred descendants. ‘To fall on one’s feet’ was therefore\r\nno auspicious event in Italy. But how can we possibly reconcile that\r\nsignification with the etymology? I think the legs peep out of the _pp_,\r\nand that _ppa_ is probably a contraction of _peda_. In Greek Ἀκρόπους\r\nmeans only ‘the beginning or tip of the foot;’ but it might as well have\r\nsignified an individual, who, on entering this shaky world of ours,\r\nphilosophically chose to take a firm ‘stand-point,’ rather than begin by\r\na foolish act, and plunge into it headlong.” It was at first a prænomen,\r\nbut became a cognomen in the clan of Menenius and of many others. Marcus\r\nVipsanius Agrippa was the friend and son-in-law of Augustus. From him\r\nthe Herods called themselves Agrippa; and his daughter was the first of\r\nthose ladies named Agrippina, whose tragic stories mark the early years\r\nof the Roman empire. Cornelius Agrippa was probably assumed by the\r\nlearned man of Cologne, who has connected it in the popular mind with\r\nalchemy and necromancy. St. Agrippina was martyred at Rome under\r\nValerian, and her remains being transferred to Girgenti in Sicily, she\r\nbecame known to the Greeks. Her name is used in Russia in the softened\r\nform of Agrafina, and the rude contraction Gruscha or Grunja. Some\r\nsuggest that Agrippa may be the Greek ἀργίπους (swift-footed).\r\n\r\nThe city of Alba Longa doubtless took its first name from that universal\r\nword that named the Alps, the Elbe, Elves, Albion, and Albin from their\r\nwhiteness, and left _albus_ still the adjective in Rome. Legend declared\r\nthat the city was called from the white sow with fifty piglings, who\r\ndirected Æneas to its site; but, however this might be, it was the\r\nsource of the family of Albinus in the Postumian gens, whence, slightly\r\naltered, came the name of the soldier Albanus, the British martyr, whose\r\ndeath led to the change from Verulamium to St. Albans, and from whom we\r\ntake the English Christian name of Alban. Another St. Albanus, or Abban,\r\nwas an Irish bishop, consecrated by St. Patrick, and probably the source\r\nof the Scottish Christian name Albany, which was often used as a\r\nrendering of the Keltic Finn, also meaning white. Another Albanus, or\r\nAlbinus, of a British family, established in Armorica, was a monastic\r\nsaint and bishop of Angers, naming the family of St. Aubin; and perhaps\r\nWilliam de Albini, the ancestor of the Howards. The modern English\r\nfeminine Albina, or Albinia, must have been formed as a name of romance\r\nfrom some of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION II.—_Augustus._\r\n\r\nAugustus is the agnomen conferred by the senate upon the second Cæsar,\r\nmeaning reverend or set apart, and was selected as hedging him with\r\nmajesty, though not offending the citizens with the word king. It is\r\nclosely related to _avigur_ or _augur_, which the Romans said was “_ob\r\navium garritus_” because the augur divined by the chatter of birds;\r\nwhile others make it come from _augeo_ (to increase); but it is not\r\nimpossible that it may be related to the Teuton _æge_ (awe). At Rome,\r\nafter Diocletian, the Augustus was always the reigning emperor, the\r\nAugusta was his wife; and no one presumed to take the name till the\r\nunfortunate Romulus Augustus, called Augustulus in contempt, who ended\r\nboth the independence of Rome and the empire with the names of their\r\nfounders.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │     Lett.     │\r\n   │Augustus       │Auguste        │August         │Aujusts        │\r\n   │Gussy          │               │               │Justs          │\r\n   │               │               │   ————————    │   ————————    │\r\n   │               │               │   Russian.    │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │               │               │Avgust         │Agoston        │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    German     │   Italian.    │   Lusatian.   │\r\n   │Augusta        │Auguste        │Augusta        │Avgusta        │\r\n   │Gussie         │Asta           │               │Gusta          │\r\n   │               │Guste          │               │Gustylka       │\r\n   │               │Gustel         │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Welsh formed the name of Awst from Augustus; but it does not seem to\r\nhave been elsewhere used, except as an epithet which the flattering\r\nchroniclers bestowed upon Philippe III. of France, until about the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, a fancy seized the small German princes\r\nof christening their children by this imperial title. August of Anhalt\r\nPlotzgau appears in 1575—seven years earlier, August of Braunsweig\r\nLuneburg. Then August of Wolfenbüttel names his daughter Anne Augusta;\r\nand we all recollect the Elector Johann August of Saxony, memorable as\r\nthe prisoner of Charles V. Thenceforth these names flourished in\r\nGermany, and took up their abode in England with the Hanoverian race.\r\n\r\nThe diminutive had, however, been adopted under the Roman empire in\r\nlater times, and was borne by the great Father Augustinus of Hippo, and\r\nhis namesake, the missionary of the Saxons. This was chosen by a Danish\r\nbishop as a Latinization of his proper name of Eystein (island stone);\r\nand it has always been somewhat popular, probably owing to the order of\r\nAugustin or Austin Friars, instituted in honour of the first St.\r\nAugustin, and once the greatest sheep owners in England.

In\r\nthe time of the Crusades, his relics were imported from the East, he\r\nbecame patron of the republic of Ragusa; and from a tradition that he\r\nhad been combed to death with iron combs, such an implement was his\r\nmark, and he was the favourite saint of the English wool-staplers. The\r\nonly vestige of this as a name in England is, however, in Goldsmith’s\r\n_Madam Blase_; but in Spanish Blas is used, as no reader of _Gil Blas_\r\ncan forget.

Some derived it, like Cæso, from _cædo_ (to cut); others\r\nsaid that the eyes of the first owner of it were unusually blue\r\n(_cæsius_), or that his hair (_cæsaries_) was wonderfully profuse; and a\r\nfourth explanation declared that it was the Moorish word for an\r\nelephant, which one of the Julii had slain with his own hand in Africa.\r\nHowever this might be, adoption into the family of Cæsar was the means\r\nof obtaining that accumulation of magisterial offices that placed the\r\nsuccessor of Julius at the head of affairs, civil and military; and\r\nwhilst habits of republican equality were still retained by the\r\nemperors, Cæsar was merely used as their designation. After the first\r\ntwelve, adoption could no longer be strained into any fiction of the\r\ncontinuance of the Julian clan, and Cæsar became more properly a title.\r\nAfter the new arrangement of the empire under Diocletian, Augustus was\r\nthe title of the emperor who had become an actual monarch, and Cæsar of\r\nthe heir to the empire with considerable delegated power. In\r\nconsequence, when Charlemagne relieved Rome from the attacks of the\r\nLombards, the pope, as the representative of the S.P.Q.R., created him\r\nCæsar, and the title has been carried on among his German\r\nrepresentatives as Kaiser, though no elected “King of the Romans” might\r\nassume this sacred title until he had been crowned by the pope’s own\r\nhand. As a Christian name it has seldom occurred. Cesare Borgia was\r\nnamed, like many Italians of his date, in the classical style, but no\r\none wished to inherit it from him, and it is seldom found except in\r\nFrance as Cesar; though in some counties of England the peasantry give\r\nit in baptism, having taken it, perhaps, from the surname Cæsar. The\r\nonly feminine I can find is Cesarina Grimaldi, in 1585. Kaiser occurs in\r\nthe same manner in Germany.\r\n\r\nCamilla was a warlike Volscian nymph, dedicated to the service of Diana,\r\nand celebrated in the _Æneid_. Her name is said to have been Casmilla,\r\nand to have been given as meaning that she was a votaress of Diana. It\r\nis believed to be an Etruscan word, and the youth of both sexes were\r\ntermed Camilli and Camillæ when employed in any solemn office; and thus\r\nCamillus became a name in the gens of Furius, and was noted in him who\r\nsaved the capitol. Nymphs always had an attraction for the French, and a\r\nCamille figures in Florian’s romance of _Numa Pompilius_, while Camilla\r\nwas adopted in the rage for classical names which actuated the English\r\nafter the Reformation, and in some few families it has been handed on to\r\nthe present day. Camillo was revived with classical names in Italy; and\r\nat the time of the Revolution, Camille was very fashionable in France.\r\nCamilla is still very common in the Abruzzi, its old classic ground.\r\n\r\nClemens came in so late that it hardly deserves to be called a cognomen,\r\nbut we find it as the third name of Titus Flavius Clemens, Vespasian’s\r\nnephew, who was put to death by Domitian, on a charge of atheism, like\r\nothers who went over to the Jewish superstition, _i. e._ to\r\nChristianity. A very early church at Rome is dedicated to him, and he is\r\nthought by some to be the same as the Clemens mentioned by St. Paul\r\n(Phil. iv. 3), author of two epistles, and first of nine bishops of Rome\r\nso called. Another great Father, St. Clemens of Alexandria, was likewise\r\nof the same name; besides a martyr of Ancyra, all called from the\r\nadjective _clemens_, which has much the same meaning as its derivative\r\nclement in all modern tongues. Its origin is uncertain: some saying it\r\nmeant of clear mind, others of inclining mind; but the substantive\r\nClementia was a personified idea, worshipped at Rome as a goddess,\r\nbearing a cup in one hand and a lance in the other. “Your Clemency”\r\nbecame a title of the emperors, and we find the orator Tertullus even\r\naddressing it to Felix. It is possible that it was thus that Clemens\r\nfirst passed to the emperor’s kinsman. There is a pretty legend that St.\r\nClement was martyred by being beheaded, and thrown into the sea, where a\r\nshrine (I think of coral) was formed round his head, and he thus became\r\nthe patron of sailors, above all, of Danes and Dutchmen. In Germany\r\nClemens has preserved its Latin form, but cuts down into Klenim, Mente,\r\nMenz, Mentzel; as in Denmark into Klemet and Mens. The English surname,\r\nMence, may perhaps be from this source; and Clement and Clementi are\r\nFrench and Italian surnames, as Clement and Clemente are the Christian\r\nones. Italy probably first modernized the abstract goddess into\r\nClemenza, whence France took up Clémence, while Germany invented\r\nClementine for the feminine, whence our Clementina, rendered popular for\r\na time in honour of the Italian lady in _Sir C. Grandison_. The Russians\r\nhave Kliment, the Hungarians Kelemen, and the Esthonians contract the\r\nname into Lemet. It must have been from the Dutch connections of eastern\r\nEngland, that Clement and Clemency were both at one time frequent.[64]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Cave; Marryat, _Jutland_; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION V.—_Constantius._\r\n\r\nConstantius arose likewise as late as any cognomen deserving to be\r\nreckoned. It comes from _constans_ (constant), a word meaning holding\r\ntogether firmly, and compounded of _con_ (together), and _stans_, the\r\nparticiple of the verb _sto_ (I am, or I stand).\r\n\r\nSo late, indeed, did Constantius become prominent in history in the\r\nperson of Flavius Valerius Constantius, that he does not even seem to\r\nhave had a prænomen, and his sons and grandsons varied the cognomen by\r\nway of distinction into Constans and Constantinus. Of these the first\r\nChristian emperor rendered the diminutive glorious, and though it has\r\nnot been much copied in the West, Κονστάντινος is one of the very few\r\nLatin names that have been Latinized among the Greeks, as well it might\r\nbe, in memory of the emperor who transported the seat of empire to a\r\nGreek city, and changed its appellation from Byzantium to\r\nConstantinopolis.\r\n\r\nConstantius Chlorus was very popular in Britain, and—as has been said\r\nbefore—the belief that his wife Helena was of British birth, held the\r\nisland firm in its allegiance till the death of the last emperor who\r\nclaimed kindred with him. And then Constantius and Constantinus were\r\nnames assumed by the rebels who first began to break the bonds of union\r\nwith the empire, as if the sound were sure to win British hearts.\r\nIndeed, Cystenian has never entirely disappeared from the Welsh\r\nnomenclature, nor Kusteninn from Brittany.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one charm of the name to a Kelt was its first syllable, which\r\nresembles the _con_ or _cu_ (wisdom or _hound_), which was one of their\r\nfavourite beginnings. The Constantines of Hector Boece’s line of\r\nScottish kings are ornamental Congals and Conchobars; and, in like\r\nmanner, Ireland has turned many a Connal and Connor into Constantine in\r\nmore modern times, accounting for the prevalence of the trisyllabled\r\nRoman as a surname.\r\n\r\nIn Russia Konstantin has been carried on, especially since the days of\r\nCatharine II., as a witness to the continuation of the Byzantine empire\r\nin that of Muscovy; and here and in the other Slavonian countries alone\r\ndoes it really prevail as a popular name, frequent enough for vernacular\r\ncontractions, such as Kostja, Kosto, Kostadin.\r\n\r\nThe feminine of both names was used by the daughters of the imperial\r\nfamily, and Constantia continued among the Provençal ladies, so as to be\r\nbrought to the throne of France by the termagant Constance of Provence,\r\nwife to that meek sovereign, Robert the Pious. She is said to have\r\ninsisted on his composing a Latin hymn in her honour, when he, not being\r\nin a mood for flattery, began to sing “_O constantia martyrum_” which\r\nshe took as a personal compliment. Constance has ever since been a royal\r\nand noble name in France, but the unfortunate Breton duchess, mother of\r\nArthur, probably received it as a supposed feminine to Conan, the name\r\nof her father. Italy made it Gostanza, and the Sicilian mother of\r\nFrederick II. transmitted it to Germany as Constanz, or Stanze. Her\r\ngreat granddaughter, the heiress of Manfred’s wrongs, took it to Spain\r\nas Constanza, the traces of which we see in the Custance, by which\r\nChaucer calls that excellent daughter of Pedro the Cruel, who was the\r\nwife of John of Gaunt. After her time it was common in England, and it\r\nis startling to find a real Constance de Beverley in disgrace in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., not, however, for forging Marmion’s letters, but\r\nfor the much more excusable misdemeanour of attending the Marchioness of\r\nExeter in a stolen visit to the Nun of Kent. In the times immediately\r\nafter the Reformation, Constance died away, then came forth as\r\nConstantia in the Minerva press, and at present reigns among the\r\nfavourite fancy names.\r\n\r\nKostancia, Kotka, Stanca are used in the Slavonian countries, but far\r\nless commonly than the masculine Constantine, which is almost entirely\r\ndisregarded by the Teuton side of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VI.—_Crispus, &c._\r\n\r\nCrispus (curled, or wrinkled), the same word which has produced our\r\ncrisp; and the French _crépé_ (applied to hair), became a cognomen, and\r\nin late times produced Crispinus and Crispinianus, two brothers who\r\naccompanied St. Quentin when he preached the Gospel in France. They\r\nsettled at Soissons, and there, while pursuing their mission, supported\r\nthemselves by making shoes until their martyrdom, A.D. 287. Shoemakers,\r\nof course, adopted them as their patrons, and theirs was a universal\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\n                        “Oh! that we now had here\r\n              But one ten thousand of those men in England\r\n              Who do no work to-day.”\r\n\r\nThat day being the 25th of October, that of the battle of Agincourt, of\r\nwhich King Henry augurs—\r\n\r\n               “And Crispin, Crispian, shall ne’er go by,\r\n               From this day to the ending of the world,\r\n               But we in it shall be remembered.”\r\n\r\nCrispin has never been a frequent Christian name, but it has become a\r\nsurname with us, and the French have Crêpin, Crêpet, and the Italians\r\nCrispino. _Crispin_ is still the French for a shoemaker’s last. Crêpin\r\nmeans a little stool which the Irish call a creepeen.\r\n\r\nDrusus, a cognomen in the Livian gens, was only accounted for among the\r\nRomans by a story that its first owner took it from having killed a\r\nchieftain in Gaul named Drausus. This word is explained by comparative\r\nphilologists as firm or rigid in Keltic, _Drud_, strong, in Welsh,\r\n_droth_ in Erse. Either the Gaul was the real cause of the surname, or\r\nit is an instance of the Keltic element in old Italian. It is hardly\r\nworthy of notice, except that, in imitation of the sister and daughter\r\nof his patron Caligula, Herod Agrippa called his daughter by the\r\nfeminine diminutive Drusilla, by which she appears by the side of Felix,\r\nhearing but little regarding the discourse of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe name of Felix himself was an agnomen frequently assumed by\r\npeculiarly fortunate individuals. It meant happy, and has given rise to\r\nall manner of words of good augury in the modern languages. No less than\r\neleven saints so called are numbered in the Roman calendar, and yet it\r\nhas never been a popular name, though sometimes occurring in Spain and\r\nFrance in the original form, and as Felice in Italy. The feminines,\r\nFelicia and Félise, in England and France, have been constructed from\r\nit, and Felicia was Queen of Navarre in 1067; but the abstract idea,\r\nFelicitas (happiness), once worshipped as a goddess at Rome, named the\r\nslave-martyr of Carthage, who suffered with St. Perpetua. There was\r\nanother Felicitas who, with her seven sons, under Antoninus Pius,\r\npresented a Christian parallel to the mother in the Maccabees. Felicità\r\nin Italy, and Félicité in France, are the votaries of one or others of\r\nthese. Felix is adopted in Ireland as a substitute for Feidlim or Phelim\r\n(ever good).\r\n\r\nFaustus and Faustina are formed exactly in the same spirit of good\r\naugury, and Fausto is sometimes an Italian name.[65]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Facciolati; Diefenbach; Smith; Butler; Anderson: _Irish Society_;\r\n  Grimm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VII.—_Galerius, &c._\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic _helm_ (protection), turned in the Latin pronunciation into\r\n_galea_ (helmet), named the persecuting Emperor Galerius, and continued\r\nin Lombardy till it formed that of Galeazzo, which became notable among\r\nthe Visconti of Milan, and was called by the French Galeas. Old Camden\r\naugured that the first Galearono was so called from all the cocks in\r\nMilan crowing at the time of his birth, and certainly, unless the\r\nfrequent Roman cognomen Gallus indicates a partly Gallic extraction, it\r\nwould either be one of the farming names, and show that the owner was\r\nnotable for his poultry, or be a differently spelt variety from Galea or\r\nhelmet. Galileo, Galilei, and Galeotti are all Italian continuations of\r\nthis old Latin name—that is, if the great astronomer’s name be not in\r\nhonour of Galilee. It is also possible that it may be connected with the\r\nKeltic _Gal_ (courage, or a stranger), which occurs again as the Irish\r\nsaint who founded an abbey in Switzerland; but more of this in Keltic\r\nregions of names.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr considers the Prisci to have been the original Latin tribe,\r\nwhose name acquired its sense of age from their antiquity, just as\r\nGothic was at one time a French and English synonym for antiquated.\r\nPriscus was the Porcian cognomen, probably denoting the descent of the\r\ngens from the Prisci; and he whom we are accustomed to call Cato the\r\nelder, as a translation of Marcus Porcius Priscus Cato, was the first to\r\nadd the second cognomen, the meaning of which is wary, from Catus,\r\nprobably a contraction from Cautus (cautious). Priscus and Prisca are\r\nboth found in the Roman martyrology; but to us the most interesting\r\nperson thus named is Priscilla, the fellow-worker of St. Paul, in honour\r\nof whom this diminutive has had some prevalence in England, though\r\nsomewhat of a puritan kind.\r\n\r\nSabinus, of course indicating a Sabine family, occurs among the Flavii,\r\nand many other gentes. Sabina was the second name of that Poppæa, Nero’s\r\nwife, whose extravagances have become a proverb, who bathed in asses'\r\nmilk, and shod her mules with gold. As a frequent cognomen, this was the\r\nname of many other women, and specially of a widow who was converted by\r\nher maid, Seraphia, to the Christian faith, and was martyred in\r\nHadrian’s persecution. There is a church at Rome dedicated to her, which\r\nwas formerly the first “Lent station,” a fact which commended her to the\r\nnotice of the Germans, and has made Sabine frequent among them. Sabina\r\nis often found among the peasantry about Gloucester, but it is possible\r\nthat this may be a corruption of Sabrina (the Severn).\r\n\r\nSerenus (serene, or good-tempered) was an old cognomen, and two saints\r\nwere so called. Serena was the niece of Theodosius, and wife of\r\nStilicho. Her appellation was chosen by Hayley for the heroine of his\r\n_Triumphs of Temper_; but it is more often imaginary than real. In\r\nNorway, however, it has been revived as an ornamental form of Siri, the\r\ncontraction of Sigrid.\r\n\r\nScipio means nothing but a staff; but it is a highly honourable title,\r\nsince it was given to one of the Cornelii, who served as the staff of\r\nhis old blind father; and the same filial piety distinguished the great\r\nAfricanus when, at seventeen, he saved the life of his father in the\r\nbattle of the Ticinus. Distinguished as is the cognomen it has not often\r\nbeen followed, though Scipione has occasionally occurred in Italy, and\r\nif Gil Blas may be trusted, in Spain.\r\n\r\nTraherne, an old Welsh name, is formed from Trajanus, which belonged to\r\nothers besides the emperor, whose noble qualities had made such an\r\nimpression on the Italian mind as to have led to the remarkable\r\ntradition that St. Gregory the Great had obtained permission to recall\r\nhim from the grave, and convert him to the true faith.\r\n\r\nTorques (a neck-chain) gave the cognomen Torquatus to the fierce Lucius\r\nManlius, who, having slain a gigantic Gaul in single combat, took the\r\ngold chain from about his neck, and hung it on his own; and who\r\nafterwards put his son, Titus Manlius Torquatus, to death for the breach\r\nof discipline in accepting a like challenge from a Tusculan noble.\r\nTorquato Tasso is the sole modern instance of the recurrence of the\r\nsurname of this “Roman Father,” the northern Torquil being from an\r\nentirely different source, _i.e._ Thorgils (Thor’s pledge).[66]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Pott; Michaelis; Camden; Diefenbach; _Philological Society_; Niebuhr;\r\n  Butler; Dante; Arnold.\r\n\r\n\r\n         SECTION VIII.—_Paullus and Magnus [small and large]._\r\n\r\nThe precedence must be given to the _less_ on account of its far greater\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the cognomen Paullus, or Paulus, the\r\ncontraction of Pauxillus, originated with one of the Æmilian gens, who\r\nwas small in stature. It was common in other gentes, though chiefly\r\ndistinguished among the Æmilii, and was most probably the name by which\r\n“Saul of Tarsus” would have been enrolled as a citizen, either from its\r\nresemblance to his Jewish name, or from the person who had conferred\r\nliberty upon his parents.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │Pawl           │Pol            │Paolo          │Paulo          │\r\n   │Paul           │Paul           │               │               │\r\n   │               │Paulot         │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │  Wallachian.  │    German.    │   Russian.    │\r\n   │Pablo          │Pawel          │Paul           │Pavel          │\r\n   │               │               │    ———————    │Pavlenka       │\r\n   │               │               │    Dutch.     │Pavluscha      │\r\n   │               │               │Paultje        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Illyrian.   │     Lett.     │  Hungarian.   │     Lapp.     │\r\n   │Pavl           │Pavils         │Pal            │Pava           │\r\n   │Pavle          │               │Palko          │Pavek          │\r\n   │Pavo           │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │   Russian.    │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Paola          │Pala           │Paola          │Pava           │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                          DIMINUTIVE.                          │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │    Welsh.     │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │   Slavonic.   │\r\n   │Peulan         │Paolino        │Paulino        │Pavlin         │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Paulina        │Pauline        │Paolina        │Pauline        │\r\n   │               │Paulette       │Paoletta       │    ———————    │\r\n   │               │               │               │   Slavonic.   │\r\n   │               │               │               │Pavlina        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nSome, however, imagine that he assumed it out of compliment to the\r\ndeputy, Sergius Paulus; others, that it was an allusion to his\r\n“weakness” of “bodily presence,” or that he took it in his humility,\r\nmeaning that he was “less than the least of the Apostles.” Be that as it\r\nmay, he has given it an honour entirely outshining that which is won\r\nfrom the Æmilii, and has spread Paul throughout Europe. The strong\r\npresumption that St. Paul preached the Gospel in Spain has rendered\r\nPablo very common there; but, in fact, the name is everywhere more usual\r\nthan in England, in spite of the tradition that the great Apostle\r\nlikewise landed here, and the dedication of our great cathedral. Perhaps\r\nthis may be owing to the fact that twelve other SS. Paul divide the\r\nallegiance of the Continent with the Apostle. Paula is not only honoured\r\nas his feminine, but as the name of the friend and correspondent of St.\r\nJerome, the mother of Eustochium; and Paola is in consequence found in\r\nItaly. Paulinus (the lengthened form) became in Welsh, Pewlin, and also\r\nnamed three saints—among them our first Northumbria, bishop of York; but\r\nit has not been followed, except in Italy, by Paolina, and _there_ is,\r\nperhaps, a mere diminutive of Paulus. Yet the feminine is far more\r\nfashionable; and Paulina, Pauline, Paolina, are the favourite forms\r\neverywhere occurring. Perhaps Pauline became the more popular in France\r\nfor the sake of that favourite grandchild whose Christian name is almost\r\nthe only one mentioned in Madame de Sévigné’s letters. It was the only\r\nform commonly recognized in France; but it seems that the sister of\r\nNapoleon was commonly called Paulette in her own family. The direct\r\nItalian diminutive always seems to be a greater favourite with the\r\nsouthern blood than its relative from the northern _chen_.\r\n\r\nThe adjective of size is another word of universal kindred, though not\r\nalways with the same meaning. The Sanscrit _mahat_, and Persian _mi_ or\r\n_meah_, are close connections of the Gothic _mikils_ (which survives in\r\nmickle and muckle, and has furnished our much), and of the Greek μεγαλος\r\nor μεγας, and Roman _magnus_ and Slavonic _magi_. All these possibly may\r\nbe remotely connected with the verb _magan_ (may), which is the source\r\nof _macht_ (might) in all Teutonic tongues.\r\n\r\nMagnus was an agnomen added as a personal distinction, as in the case of\r\nPompey. It was never a name till long after the Roman empire was over,\r\nwhen Karl der Grösse, as his Franks called him, had been Latinized into\r\nCarolus Magnus, and honoured by the French as Charlemagne. St. Olaf of\r\nNorway was known to be a great admirer of Charlemagne, whose example he\r\nwould fain have imitated, and his followers, by way of a pleasant\r\nsurprise and compliment to him, before they woke him to announce to him\r\nthe birth of his first son, christened the child, as they thought, after\r\nthe latter half of the great Emperor Carolus Magnus. That child became a\r\nmuch-beloved monarch, under the denomination of King Magnus Barefoot,\r\nfrom his having established his identity on his return from Ireland, by\r\nthe ordeal of walking unshod over red-hot ploughshares. In honour of his\r\nmany excellencies, as King of Norway, the entire North uses his name of\r\nMagnus, and transplanted it to Ireland, where it flourished under the\r\nform of Manus, until it became the fashion to ‘Anglicize’ it into\r\nManasses. The Scottish islands, where the population is Norse, likewise\r\nuse Magnus as a baptismal name; and the Lapps have turned it into Manna,\r\nor Mannas.\r\n\r\nMaximus was likewise properly an individual agnomen of size, or of\r\nvictory, as with Fabius Maximus; but it came to be a proper name, and\r\nwas borne by Maximus the Monk, a great Greek ecclesiastic of the sixth\r\ncentury, as well as by many other obscure saints, from whom the Italians\r\nderive their Massimo, and the French Maxime, and the Welsh their old\r\nMacsen.\r\n\r\nMaxentius and Maximinus, both named not only persecuting emperors, but\r\nChristian martyrs, whence Maxime and Maximien. Maximilianus was one of\r\nthe Seven Sleepers, but he is not the origin of the German imperial\r\nname. According to Camden, this was a compound invented by the Emperor\r\nFrederick VII., and bestowed on his son in his great admiration of\r\nFabius Maximus and Scipio Æmilianus. “The Last of the Knights,” with his\r\nwild effrontery and spirited chamois-hunting might be despised by the\r\nItalians, as _Massimiliano Pochi Danari_; but he was beloved by the\r\nAustrians as “Our Max.” His great grandson, Maximilian II., contributed\r\nto the popularity of his unwieldy name, and Max continues to be one of\r\nthe favourite German appellations, from the archduke to the peasant, to\r\nthe present day; and has even thrown out the feminine Maximiliane. The\r\nPoles and Illyrians use _ks_ instead of _x_ in spelling it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION IX.—_Rufus, &c._\r\n\r\nRufus, the red or ruddy, was a cognomen of various families, and was, in\r\nfact, one of the adjectives occurring in the nomenclature of almost\r\nevery nation; and chiefly of those where a touch of Keltic blood has\r\nmade the hair vary between red and black. Flavius, Fulvius, Rufus, and\r\nan occasional Niger, were the Roman names of complexion; and it is\r\ncurious to find the single instances of Chlorus (the yellow), occurring\r\nin the Flavian family. The Biondi of Italy claim to be the Flavii, and\r\nthence the Blound, Count de Guisnes, companion of William the Conqueror,\r\ntook the name now Blount!\r\n\r\nRufus is, indeed, the Latin member of the large family of which we spoke\r\nin mentioning the Greek Rhoda; and the Kelts had, in plenty, their own\r\nRuadh or Roy; nevertheless, such as fell under Roman dominion adopted\r\nthe Roman Rufus or Rufinus; and it passed on by tradition in Wales, as\r\nGruffin, Gruffydd, or as the English caught it and spelt it, correctly\r\nrepresenting the sound of _dd_, Griffith. It was the name of many Welsh\r\nprinces, and has passed into a frequent surname.\r\n\r\nIn its Gruffin stage, it passed into the commonwealth of romance. Among\r\nthe British names that had worked through the lost world of minstrelsy,\r\nto reappear in the cycle with which Italian poets graced the camp and\r\ncourt of Charlemagne, is Grifone, a descendant of Bevis of Hampton. By\r\nthis time, no doubt, his name was supposed to be connected with the\r\nGriffin, that creature with _griffes_, or claws; that after having\r\nserved in earlier times, as with Dante, to represent the Italian idea of\r\nthe vision of the cherubim, had been gradually degraded to a brilliant\r\nportion of the machinery of romance.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Italians who bore the name of Grifone, thought more of the\r\n“right Griffin” and the true knight, than of the ruddy Roman whose\r\nRuffino or Ruffo was still left lingering among them; together with\r\nRufina, the name of a virgin martyr.\r\n\r\nRufus is, for some reason or other, rather a favourite at present with\r\nour American neighbours.\r\n\r\nNiger (the black) was a cognomen of various Romans of no great note, and\r\ndistinguished a teacher from Antioch, mentioned in the Acts. The\r\ndiminutive Nigellus seems to have been adopted in France, by the\r\nNormans, as a translation of the Nial which they had brought from\r\nNorway, after having learned it of the Gael, in whose tongue it means\r\nthe noble. In Domesday Book, twelve proprietors are recorded as Nigel,\r\nboth before and after the Conquest, being probably Danish Nials thus\r\nreduced to the Neustrian French Latin. Of these was Nigel de Albini\r\n(_temp._ William I.), and Nigel de Mowbray (_temp._ Henry II.). The\r\ninflux of Anglo-Normans into Scotland introduced this new-fashioned\r\nNigel, and it was adopted as the English form of Niel, and has since\r\nbecome almost exclusively confined to Scotland, where it is a national\r\nname, partly perhaps in memory of the untimely fate of Niel or Nigel\r\nBruce; and among the covenanters, for the sake of the fierce Nigel\r\nLeslie, Master of Rothes. It has shared the fate of Colin and of the\r\ntrue Nial, and has been taken for Nicolas. The French used a like name,\r\nwhich Froissart spells Nesle; but this is probably from the inference\r\nthat a lengthened sound of _e_ infers a silent _s_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                       NAMES FROM ROMAN DEITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I.\r\n\r\nA short chapter must be given to the modern names that, in spite of the\r\ncanon prohibiting the giving of names of heathen gods in baptism, are\r\neither those of Latin divinities, or are derived from them. These,\r\nthough few in number, are more than are to be found in the Greek class,\r\nfrom the fact that where a Roman deity had become identified with a\r\nGreek one, the Latin name was used throughout Western Europe in all\r\ntranslations, and only modern criticism has attempted to distinguish\r\nbetween the distinct myths of the two races. Most of these are, or have\r\nbeen, in use either in France or England, the modern countries most\r\nunder the dominion of fancy with regard to names.\r\n\r\nAurora (the dawn), so called, it is said, from _aurum_ (gold), because\r\nof the golden light she sheds before her, assumed all the legends\r\nattached by the Greeks to their Eos, whose rosy fingers unbarred the\r\ngates of day. When the Cinque-cento made classic lore the fashion,\r\nAurore came into favour with the fair dames of France, and has ever\r\nsince there continued in vogue, occasionally passing into Germany. In\r\nIllyria, the dawn and the lady are both called Zora, and she in\r\nendearment Zorana.[67]\r\n\r\nBellona was not a goddess whose name one would have expected to find\r\nrenewed in Christian times, yet instances have been found of it in\r\nEngland among those who probably had some idea that it was connected\r\nwith beauty instead of with _bellum_ (war). In effect, hers is not quite\r\na proper name, being really an adjective, with the noun understood,\r\n_Bellona Dea_ (the war goddess). An infant born in the streets of Weimar\r\nduring the sack that followed the battle of Jena was named Angelina\r\nBellona, as having been an angel of comfort to her parents in the\r\nmiseries of war. She became a great musician, and won renown for her\r\nname in her own land.[68]\r\n\r\nThe old Latin deities were often in pairs, masculine and feminine.\r\nDivus, that part of their title that is still recognized as belonging to\r\nthe supernatural, is from the same source as the Sanscrit _deva_,\r\nPersian _dev_, Greek δῖος, 0εός, Zeus, and was applied to all. Divus\r\nJanus and Diva Jana were one of these pairs, who presided over day and\r\nnight, as the sun and moon. Divajana became Diana; and as groves were\r\nsacred to her, and she was as pure a goddess as Vesta, there was every\r\nreason for identifying her with the Greek Artemis, and giving her\r\npossession of the temple of Ephesus, and the black stone image that\r\n“fell down from Jupiter,” or the sky; she had Apollo given as her fellow\r\ninstead of Janus, and thenceforth was the goddess of the silver bow,\r\ndaughter of Jupiter and Latona, as Artemis had been of Zeus and Leto.\r\nHer name slept as a mere pagan device till the sixteenth century, when\r\nromances of chivalry gave place to the semi-classical pastoral, of which\r\nGreece was usually the scene. Jorge de Montemayor, the Spanish gentleman\r\nwho led the way in this flowery path, named his heroine, Diana, and she\r\nwas quickly copied by the sponsors of Diane de Poitiers, the fair widow\r\nwhose colours of black and white were worn by Henry II. of France even\r\nto his last fatal tournament. Diane thus became so fashionable in\r\nFrance, that when the Cavalier court was there residing, the English\r\ncaught the fashion, and thenceforth Lady Dye at times appeared among the\r\nLadies Betty and Fanny of the court. In the lower classes, Diana seems\r\nto be at times confused with the Scriptural Dinah, though it may\r\nsometimes be adopted as a Bible name, since a peasant has been known to\r\npronounce that he well knew who was “greatest ‘Diana of the\r\nEphesians,’—a great lady of those parts, and very charitable to the\r\npoor.” At Rome Jewesses now alone bear it, and Italian Christians\r\nconsequently despise it, and only give it to dogs. However, in the\r\neighteenth century, a Monna Diana existed at Florence, who is recorded\r\nas an example of the benefits of a heavy head wrapper, for a large stone\r\nfell upon her head from a building, and she took it for a small pebble!\r\n\r\nDiana’s fellow, Divus Janus, had a very different career. He was\r\nsometimes called Dianus, but much more commonly Janus, and from being\r\nmerely the sun, he became allegorical of the entire year, and had a\r\nstatue with four faces for the seasons, and hands pointing the one to\r\n300, the other to 55, thus making up the amount of days then given to\r\nthe year; and before him were twelve altars, one for each month. He thus\r\npresided over the beginning of everything, and the first month of the\r\nyear was from him called Januarius, as were all gates _jani_, and doors\r\n_januæ_; and above all, that gate between the Sabines and the Romans,\r\nwhich was open when they were friends, shut when they were foes. When\r\nthe two nations had become thoroughly fused together, the gate grew to a\r\ntemple; but the ceremony of shutting the doors was still followed on the\r\nrare occasions when Rome was at peace, and of opening them when at war\r\nto let the god go out, as it was now said, to help the Romans. This idea\r\nof peace, however, turned Janus into a legendary peaceful monarch, who\r\nonly wore two heads that he might look both ways to see either side of a\r\nquestion, and keys were put into his hand as the guardian of each man’s\r\ngate. His own special gate continued to be called Janicula, and his name\r\npassed from the door, _janua_, to the porter, _janitor_; and thence in\r\nmodern times to St. Peter, who, bearing the keys, was called by the\r\nItalians, _il Janitore di Cielo_, and thence the fish, which was thought\r\nto bear the mark of St. Peter’s thumb, was _il janitore_, or, as we call\r\nit, the John Dory, if not from its gilded scales, _dorée_ or _dorado_.\r\nIts Spanish name of San Pedro would favour the janitor theory. The month\r\nof Janus, Janvier, January, Gennaro, Januar, has kept its name, like all\r\nthe other months of the Roman calendar, in spite of the French attempt\r\nto displace them with Glacial, Pluvial, &c. Birth in the month of\r\nJanuary occasioned the name of Januarius to be given to various persons\r\nin the time of the Roman empire, to one of the seven sons of St.\r\nFelicitas, to a martyr whose day is the 13th of October, and especially\r\nto St. Januarius, of Beneventum, who in the persecution of Diocletian\r\nwas thrown to wild beasts at Pozzuoli, and on their refusal to hurt him,\r\nwas beheaded. His blood was already a religious curiosity before the\r\neighth century, when it was thought to have delivered Naples from an\r\neruption of Mount Vesuvius, and it furnishes one of the most\r\nquestionable and most hotly-defended miracles of the Church of Rome.\r\nAfter this Gennaro cannot fail to be a very frequent Neapolitan\r\nChristian name.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION II.—_Florentius._\r\n\r\nThe goddess of flowers was called from their Latin name _flos_, the same\r\nthat has passed into all European languages except the German. In late\r\ntimes the name of Florus was formed from that of the goddess, and is\r\nmemorable as that of the procurator, whose harshness drove the Jews to\r\ntheir last rebellion. Flora was probably first used merely as the\r\nfeminine of Florus. There is a church at Florence to SS. Fiore and\r\nLucilla, otherwise the first occurrence of any variety of Flora is in\r\nRoman-Gothic Spain, where the unhappy daughter of Count Julian was\r\ncalled by the Spanish diminutive Florinda, and thus caused the name to\r\nbe so much detested, that while Spanish ballads called her _la Cava_,\r\nthe wicked, her Christian name was only bestowed upon dogs, and\r\ncuriously enough it was the little spaniel (a Spanish breed), for which\r\nFlora was considered in England as an appropriate name. A Spanish\r\nmaiden, however, who was martyred by the Moors in 851, brought Flora\r\ninto better repute; and Flore became known to the French, though\r\nprobably first adopted as a romantic epithet; and through the close\r\nconnection between France and Scotland, it passed to the latter country,\r\nthe especial land of floral names, and there became frequent as the\r\nEnglish equivalent to the Gaelic Finghin. It was spelt as Florie by the\r\nisland heroine of the '45. Florentius was the natural product of the\r\ngoddess Flora, and named a female saint, Florentia, martyred with two\r\nothers, both men, in Diocletian’s persecution in Gaul, and commemorated\r\nby a monastery built over the spot. St. Florentius was likewise a Gaul,\r\nand was sent by St. Martin to preach in Poitou. His relics were at first\r\nat Saumur, but in the eleventh century were taken to Roye, and in the\r\ntime of Louis XI., were divided between the two cities. As an Angevin\r\nsaint, he quite accounts for the prevalence of Florence in the masculine\r\ngender among the Anglo-Norman nobles of the middle ages; but it soon\r\ndied away. The recent revival is chiefly owing to the name having been\r\ngiven to English girls born at the Italian city so called, and it has\r\nsince acquired a deeper and dearer honour in the person of Florence\r\nNightingale. From the city, or else as a diminutive of Florentius, arose\r\nFlorentinus, a name borne by various distinguished persons in the latter\r\ndays of the empire, and saintly in the person of a martyr of Burgundy.\r\nFlorentina was one of the daughters of St. Leander, of Spain, and the\r\nrelics of these saints scattered the names of Florentin and Florentine\r\nover a wide extent in France. Besides these, should be mentioned the\r\nromantic name, Blanchefleur. It is given to Sir Trystan’s mother, and\r\nprobably translates some Keltic name analogous to the Erse Blathnaid,\r\nFinbil, and Finscoth, all of which mean white flower.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Florence, or Flory, so common among the peasantry, is intended\r\nfor Finghin, or Fineen (fair offspring); also for Flann, Fithil, and\r\nFlaithri.[70]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Keightley; Michaelis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Keightley; Smith; Key, _Latin Grammar_; Madame Scopenhauer, _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Keightley; Smith; Bouterwek; _Istoria de Firenze_; Brand; Butler;\r\n  _Spanish Literature_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Butler; _Irish Society_; Pott.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION III.—_Laurentius._\r\n\r\nIt appears natural to refer Laurentius direct to _laurus_ (the bay or\r\nlaurel); but there is reason to think that it, as well as the tree, must\r\ngo farther back to the dim vestiges of early Roman mythology. From the\r\nEtruscans the Romans learnt the beautiful idea of guardian spirits\r\naround their hearths, whom they called by the Etruscan word _lar_ or\r\n_lars_; meaning lord or master. The spirits of great statesmen or heroes\r\nbecame public _lares_, and watched over the welfare of the city; those\r\nof good men, or of innocent infants under forty days old, were the\r\n_lares_ of their home and family. Their images, covered with dogskins,\r\nand with the figure of a dog beside them, were placed beside every\r\nhearth; and, curiously enough, are the origin of the name dogs, still\r\napplied to the supports on either side of a wood fire-place. They were\r\nmade to partake in every household festival; cups were set apart, in\r\nwhich a portion of every meal was poured out to them; the young bride,\r\non being carried across her husband’s threshold, made her first\r\nobeisance to these household spirits of his family; and on the nones,\r\nides, and calends of each month, when the master returned from the war,\r\nor on any other occasion of joy, the lares were crowned with wreaths and\r\ngarlands. Pairs of lares stood in niches at the entrance of the streets;\r\nother lares guarded districts in the country; and the lares of all Rome\r\nhad a temple to themselves, where stood twin human figures with a dog\r\nbetween them. All these wore green crowns on festival days, especially\r\non those of triumph; and thus there can be little doubt that the\r\nevergreen whose leaves were specially appropriated to the purpose was\r\nthence called _laurus_, as the poplar was from forming people’s crowns.\r\nThe special feast of the lares was on the 22nd of December, and it was\r\nimmediately followed by that of a female deity called Lara, Larunda,\r\nLarentia, Laurentia, or Acca Laurentia, who was termed in old Latin\r\n_genita mana_ (good mother), received the sacrifice of a dog, and was\r\nentreated that no good domestic slave might depart. Thus much custom had\r\npreserved to the Romans; but when Greek mythology came in, flooding and\r\ncorrupting all their own, poor Laurentia was turned into a nymph, so\r\ngiven to chattering (λαλιά) that Jupiter punished her by cutting out her\r\ntongue and sending her, in charge of Mercury, to the lower world; and\r\nthe lares, now allowed to be only two, were made into her children and\r\nthose of Mercury. Another story, wishing to account for all traditions\r\nin one, made her into the woman who nursed Romulus and Remus, and thus\r\ndisposed of her and of the she-wolf at once, and made the twelve rural\r\nLares her sons; whilst a third version degraded her, like Flora, and\r\nmade her leave all her property to the state, in the time of Ancus\r\nMartius.\r\n\r\nLaurentius does not occur in early history; but it belonged to the\r\ngentle Roman deacon who, on the 10th of August, 258, showed the “poor\r\nand the maimed, the halt and the blind,” as the treasures of the Church,\r\nand was martyred, by being roasted over a fire on bars of iron.\r\nConstantine built a church on his tomb, and seven other Churches at Rome\r\nare likewise dedicated to him. Pope Adrian gave some of his relics to\r\nCharlemagne, who took them to Strasburg, and thus rendered him one of\r\nthe regnant saints in Germany, where the prevalence of shooting stars on\r\nthe night of his feast has occasioned those meteors to be called St.\r\nLorenz’s sparks. In fact, his gentle nature, his peculiar martyrdom, and\r\nhis church at Rome, caused him to be a saint of universal popularity;\r\nand a fresh interest was conferred on him, in Spanish eyes, by Philip\r\nII.’s belief that the battle of St. Quentin, fought on his day, was won\r\nby his intercession, and the consequent dedication of the\r\ngridiron-palace convent of the Escurial to him.\r\n\r\nBesides the original saint, England owns St. Laurentius among the band\r\nof Roman missionaries who accompanied St. Augustine, and, in succession,\r\nbecame archbishops of Canterbury. When England, in her turn, sent forth\r\nmissionaries, another Laurence preached the Word in the North, with such\r\neffect as to compel the Trollds themselves to become church builders,\r\nmuch against their will, and to leave his name, cut down into Lars, its\r\nprimitive form, as a favourite in all Scandinavia. In Ireland, Laurence,\r\nwhose name I strongly suspect to have been Laghair, a son of Maurice\r\nO'Tuathail, of Leinster, was archbishop of Dublin at the time of the\r\nconquest by the Norman adventurers, and was thus brought into close\r\nconnection with Canterbury and with Rome, knitting the first of the\r\nlinks that have made the Irish so abject in their devotion to the Papal\r\nSee. It was probably on this account that he was canonized, but he was\r\nalso memorable as one of the builders of St. Patrick’s cathedral at\r\nDublin, and for his charities during a terrible famine, when he\r\nsupported as many as 300 destitute children. It is he who has rendered\r\nLanty and Larry so common among the Irish peasantry. Besides all these,\r\nthe modern Venetian saint, Lorenzo Justiniani, worthily maintained the\r\nhonour of the Christian name already so illustrious in excellence, and\r\nit has continued in high esteem everywhere, though, perhaps, less common\r\nin England than on the Continent. Germany is the place of its special\r\nreign; and in the Harz mountains, to bow awkwardly is called _krummer\r\nLorenz machen_.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    Irish.     │    French.    │\r\n   │Lawrence       │Lawrence       │Laurenc        │Laurent        │\r\n   │Laurence       │Laurie         │Lanty          │               │\r\n   │Larkin         │               │Larry          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │    Swiss.     │\r\n   │Lorenzo        │Lorenzo        │Laurençho      │Lori           │\r\n   │Renzo          │               │               │Lenz           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Enz            │\r\n   │               │               │               │Enzali         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │  Wallachian.  │   Swedish.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Lorenz         │Lavrentia      │Laurentius     │Lorenz         │\r\n   │               │               │Lars           │Lars           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Lauritz        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Norse.     │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │\r\n   │Laurans        │Lavrentij      │Vavrzynec      │Vavrinec       │\r\n   │Jörens         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Larse          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Slovak.    │  Lithuanian.  │     Lapp.     │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Lovre          │Labrenzis      │Laur           │Lörencz        │\r\n   │               │Brenzis        │Laures         │               │\r\n   │               │Lauris         │Laura          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Raulus         │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nSome languages have the feminine, but it is not frequent anywhere. The\r\nItalian Lorenza is, perhaps, the most frequent.\r\n\r\nThe name of Laura is a great perplexity. It _may_ be taken from Laurus,\r\nand ladies so called consider St. Laurence as their patron; but it may\r\nalso be from the word Laura, the Greek Λαβρα, or Λαυρα, meaning an\r\navenue, the same as labyrinth, and applied to the clusters of hermitages\r\nwhich were the germ of monasteries. Or again, a plausible derivation is\r\nthat Lauretta might have commemorated the laurel-grove, or Loreto,\r\nwhither Italian superstition declared that the angels transported the\r\nholy house of Nazareth away from the Turkish power on the conquest of\r\nPalestine. Those who call the milky-way the Santa Strada di Loretto,\r\nmight well have used this as one of their varied forms of seeking the\r\npatronage of the Blessed Virgin. The chief objection that I can find to\r\nthis theory is, that the first Lauretta that I have met with was a\r\nFlemish lady, in 1162; the next was a daughter of William de Braose,\r\nLord of Bramber, in the time of King John, a period antecedent to the\r\nsupposed migration of the holy house, which did not set out on its\r\ntravels till 1294. Others think it the same with Eleonora, which I\r\ncannot believe; but, at any rate, it was the Provençal Lora de Sades, so\r\nlong beloved of Petrarch, who made this one of the favourite romantic\r\nand poetical names, above all, in France, where it is Laure, Lauretta,\r\nLoulou.[71]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Smith; Keightley; Loudon, _Arboretum_; Butler; Jameson; Grimm; Pott;\r\n  Michaelis; Dugdale; Hanmer, _Chronicle of Ireland_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IV.—_Sancus._\r\n\r\nSancus, or Sanco-Sancus, was the divinity who presided over oaths, and\r\nguarded the marriage vow and treaties between nations. He was afterwards\r\nmixed up with Hercules, and so entirely forgotten that his altar was\r\nlong supposed to have been an early Christian erection bearing the word\r\nsanctus.\r\n\r\nThis word is the past participle of the verb _sancire_ (to decree). It\r\nwas equivalent to instituted, and was gradually applied to mark the\r\ninstitutions of religion. That “all the congregation are holy,” all\r\nunder sanctification, all once at least saints, was a faith strong in\r\nthe Church, and prompted the name of Sanctus among the first Christians.\r\n\r\nOne Sanctus was a deacon of the band of martyrs at Lyons, and another\r\nSanctus was a Christian physician of Otriculum, a city of central Italy,\r\nand was put to death under the Antonines. There is some doubt whether he\r\nis the same physician of Otriculum who is also called St. Medicus.\r\n\r\nSanctus was the favourite patron in Provence, Biscay, and Navarre; and\r\nSancho and Sancha were constantly in royal use in the early kingdoms of\r\nthe struggling Christians of Spain; though as royalty and nobility\r\nbecame weary of what was national and peculiar, they were left to the\r\npeasantry, and would have been entirely forgotten, but for that\r\nwonderful personification of the shrewd, prosaic, selfish, yet faithful\r\nelement in human nature, Sancho Panza, whom Cervantes has made one of\r\nthe most typical yet individual characters of literature.\r\n\r\nThe Provençals had both the masculine and feminine forms in frequent\r\nuse; and the co-heiress of Provence, who married our Richard, Earl of\r\nCornwall, king of the Romans, was Sancia, or Sancie; but the name did\r\nnot take root in England, and sorely puzzled some of our old\r\ngenealogists, who record the lady as Cynthia, Scientia, or Science. This\r\nlast name actually occurs several times in the seventeenth century, both\r\nin Latin and English, in the register of a small Hampshire parish; but\r\nwhether meant for Sancha, or chosen in love for abstract knowledge,\r\nthose who named ‘Science Dear’ alone could tell.\r\n\r\nItaly, as in duty bound, remembered her saintly physician as Sancto at\r\nRome, and Sanzio with the ‘lingua Toscana,’ where it came as a family\r\nname to the greatest of painters.[72]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION V.—_Old Italian Deities._\r\n\r\nFebruus was the old Italian god both of the dead and of fertility, to\r\nwhom February was sacred. The word is thought to mean purification, but\r\nafter the Etruscan deities were forgotten, Juno, who had also a share in\r\nthe month, absorbed it all, and was called Juno Februata. Thence,\r\nprobably, arose the name of Febronia, a nun of Sibapolis on the borders\r\nof Assyria, who suffered horrid torments under her persecutors, and was\r\nat last beheaded. She is venerated by the Greek Church on the 25th of\r\nJune, and suggested to Russia the names Fevronia, or Khevronia.\r\n\r\nThough not divine, the name of Lavinia should be mentioned here as that\r\nof a mythical personage imitated by the moderns, though not by the\r\nRomans themselves. In Livy and in Virgil, she is the daughter of King\r\nLatinus, and the last wife of Æneas, in whose right he obtained a\r\nfooting in Italy. Niebuhr and his followers deny her existence, and make\r\nher a mere personification of the Latin territory, and whether this be\r\nthe case or not, hers is certainly a feminine form of Latinus, the _t_\r\nchanged to _v_, as happened in other instances. The classical Italians\r\nof the Cinque-cento revived Lavinia for their daughters; and by way of\r\nrecommending the story of the Book of Ruth to the taste of the\r\neighteenth century, Thomson had the audacity to translate the Moabitess\r\ninto “the lovely young Lavinia,” whence it has happened that this has\r\nbecome rather a favourite with those classes in England who have a taste\r\nfor many syllables ending in _ia_.\r\n\r\nPicus was another old Italian deity who used to be represented with a\r\nwoodpecker on his head. Whether he or the woodpecker first had the name\r\nof Picus does not appear; but in English that term passed to the pyot or\r\nmagpie, and some recurrence to old tradition caused Pico to be revived\r\nin Italy in the person of the famous Pico de Mirandola and his\r\nnamesakes.\r\n\r\nFrom _fors_ (chance) came Fortuna, the goddess of prosperity and\r\nsuccess. She was said on entering Rome to have thrown away her globe,\r\nand shed her wings like a queen-ant, to denote that here she took up her\r\npermanent abode. She was adored at Rome as early as the reign of Ancus\r\nMartius, and to her was ascribed the success of the women’s entreaty in\r\nturning away the wrath of Coriolanus.\r\n\r\nHer name does not appear to have been used in the heathen times, but in\r\n212 SS. Felix and Fortunatus were martyred at Valence in Dauphiné, and\r\nit was probably from the latter that Fortunio became a name among the\r\nearly Asturian and Navarrese sovereigns.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we think of the augury of names when we find in the parish\r\nregister of St. John’s, Newcastle, on the 20th of June, 1599, the\r\nmarriage of Umphraye Hairope, husbandman, to Fortune Shafto,\r\ngentlewoman?\r\n\r\nA pair of twins, girls, of the Wycliffe family, born in 1710, were\r\nchristened Favour and Fortune; and Fortune is a surname in Scotland.[73]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Keightley; Smith.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Niebuhr; Arnold; Surius; Keightley; Sir O. Sharpe, _Extracts from\r\n  Parish Registers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VI.—_Quirinus._\r\n\r\nQuirinus, one of the oldest of the war-gods, was called from the Oscan\r\n_quiris_ (a spear), which likewise was the source of the old Roman name\r\nof Quirites, and of that of the Quirinal Hill. Spearmen alike were the\r\nQuirites and their unconquerable foes; the Gjermanner, the Germans, nay,\r\nprobably _gher_ and _quiris_ are the very same word, equally related to\r\nthe Keltic _coir_.\r\n\r\nOthers, however, call Quirinus the mere personified god of the town of\r\nCures. When all had become confusion in the Roman mind as to their old\r\nobjects of worship, and they had mingled them with “gods whom their\r\nfathers knew not,” they took it into their heads that Quirinus was the\r\ndeified Romulus who had been transported to the skies by his father,\r\nMars, in the middle of a muster of his warriors in the Campus Martius;\r\nand when a still later age distrusted this apotheosis, some rationalist\r\nRoman suggested that, weary of Romulus' tyranny, the senators had\r\nsecretly assassinated him during the review, and to prevent detection\r\nhad cut his body to pieces, each carried a portion home under his toga,\r\nand professed to have beheld the translation to the skies. Quirinus had\r\nbecome a cognomen at the Christian era, but first occurs as a Christian\r\nname in 304, when St. Quirinus was Bishop of Siscia on the Save, and\r\nafter a good confession before the tyrant Maximus, was dragged in chains\r\nthrough the cities on the banks of the Danube, and then drowned at\r\nSabaria, now Sarwar. His relics were afterwards taken to Rome, but are\r\nnow said to be in Bavaria; and in his honour Cyran has become a French\r\nname. As a saint connected with Germany, various chapters arose in\r\ncommemoration of him; and Mrs. Elizabeth Carter describes her meeting\r\nwith a pretty little _chanoinesse_ at Spa, who wore her medal of St.\r\nQuirinus, but was able to give so little account of him that Mrs.\r\nCarter, better read in Roman history than in hagiology, concluded him to\r\nbe the “Saint who built Rome and killed his brother.”\r\n\r\nQuirinius was the name of the Roman governor whom St. Luke called in\r\nGreek Κυρήνιος, and our translators render Cyrenius.\r\n\r\nThe name of Romulus is thought by many to have been a mere myth made out\r\nof that of his city Roma, a word that probably signified strength, and\r\nwas no inappropriate title for that empire of iron. Ῥώμη is the Greek\r\nword for strength; the same root is found in the Latin _robur_, and it\r\nmay be in the Teutonic _ruhm_ (fame). Others say that _groma_ (a\r\ncross-road) was the origin of this most famous of all local titles.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, after Romulus Augustulus had seen the twelve\r\ncenturies of Rome fulfilled, Romolo still lingered on as a name in\r\nItaly; the first bishop of Fiesole was thus named, and was so popular at\r\nFlorence, that Catherine dei Medici was actually christened Romola.\r\n\r\nWhen to be a Roman citizen was the highest benefit a man of a subject\r\nnation could enjoy, Romanus was treated as a cognomen. Pliny had two\r\nfriends so called. There are seven saints thus named, and three\r\nByzantine emperors. But when Teuton sway had made a Roman the meanest\r\nand most abject epithet, Romain or Romano died away in popularity, and\r\nonly occurs now and then in French genealogy, though it is still used in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThey must not be confounded with Romeo and Romuald, which are genuine\r\nTeutonic.[74]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Diefenbach; Arnold; Livy; Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VII.—_Sibylla._\r\n\r\nThe Sibyls were beings peculiar to Roman mythology, prophetesses half\r\nhuman, half divine, living to a great age, but not immortal.\r\nEtymologists used to interpret their name as coming from the Greek Ζεύς\r\nand βουλή (Zeus' councils), but it is far more satisfactorily explained\r\nas coming from _sabius_, or _sabus_, an old Italian, but not a Latin\r\nword, which lives still in the vernacular _Sabio_, thus making Sibulla\r\nsignify a wise old woman.\r\n\r\nOld, indeed! for the Cumean Sibyl, who guided Æneas to the infernal\r\nregions, was likewise said to be the same who brought the prophetic\r\nbooks for sale to Tarquinius Priscus, and on each refusal of the sum\r\nthat she demanded for them, carried them off, destroyed one, and brought\r\nthe rest back rated at a higher price. The single remaining roll bought\r\nby the king was said to contain all the mysterious prophecies that were\r\nafterwards verified by the course of events, and above all, that\r\nprediction of the coming rule of peace, which Virgil, following\r\nTheocritus, embodied in his eclogue as fulfilled in Augustus. That\r\neclogue, flattery though it were, won for Virgil his semi-Christian\r\nfame, and caused the learned men of Italy to erect the Sibyls into the\r\npersonifications of heathen presages of Gospel truth—\r\n\r\n                       “Teste David cum Sibylla,”\r\n\r\nas says the glorious hymn uniting the voices of Hebrew and Gentile\r\nprophecy; and in this character do Michel Angelo’s magnificent Sibyls\r\nadorn the Sistine Chapel; though later painters, such as Guido and\r\nDomenichino, made them mere models of female intellectual beauty.\r\n\r\nSibilla, probably through the influence of Campania upon nomenclature,\r\nearly spread as a Christian name. Possibly the word was the more\r\nacceptable to Northern ears from its resemblance to the Gothic _sibja_\r\n(peace, or friendship), the word familiar to us as the Scottish _sib_\r\n(related), forming with us the last syllable of gossip, in its old sense\r\nof god-parent. Thence came Sippia, Sib, or Sif, the lovely wife of Thor,\r\nwhose hair was cut off by Lok, and its place supplied by golden tresses,\r\nwhich some consider to mean the golden harvest.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this connection that recommended the Italian Sibila to\r\nthe Norman chivalry. At any rate, Sibila of Conversana was the wife of\r\nRobert of Normandy, and Sibille soon travelled into France, and belonged\r\nto that Angevin Queen of Jerusalem, whose many marriages gave so much\r\ntrouble to the Crusaders. It was very frequent among English ladies of\r\nNorman blood; and in Spain, Sevilla, or Sebilla, is frequent in the\r\nearlier ballads. Sibella, Sibyl, or Sibbie, is most frequent of all in\r\nIreland and Scotland; but I believe that this is really as the\r\nequivalent for the ancient Gaelic Selbhflaith (lady of possessions).\r\n\r\nRussia has the name as Ssivilla; the Lithuanians call it Bille; and the\r\nEsthonians, Pil. Sibilley is the form in which it appears in a Cornish\r\nregister in 1692; in 1651 it is Sibella.[75]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VIII.—_Saturn, &c._\r\n\r\nSaturnus was a mythical king of ancient Italy, peaceful, and given to\r\nagriculture, indeed, his name is thought to come from _satus_ (sown). It\r\nis very odd that he should have become the owner of all the fame of the\r\nGreek Kronos, infanticide, planet rings, and all; but so completely has\r\nhe seized upon them that we never think of him as the god of seed-time,\r\nbut only as the discarded king of heaven and father of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nWe should have little to do with him were it not that the later Romans\r\nformed from him the name of Saturninus, which belonged to sundry early\r\nsaints, and furnished the old Welsh Sadwrn.\r\n\r\nSylvanus was a deity called from _sylva_ (a wood), the protector of\r\nhusbandmen and their crops, in the shape of an old man with a\r\ncypress-tree in his hand. His had become a Roman name just before the\r\nChristian era, and belonged to the companion of St. Paul, who is called\r\nSylvanus in the Epistles, and, by the contraction, Silas in the Acts.\r\nThis contracted form, Silas, has been revived in England as a Scripture\r\nname.\r\n\r\nSt. Sylvanus, or Silverius, was a pope whom his Church esteems a martyr,\r\nas he died in the hands of Belisarius; but sylvan, or salvage, was\r\nchiefly used in the middle ages to express a dweller in a forest, rude\r\nand hardly human. Silvano, Selvaggio, or Silvestro, was generally the\r\nname of monsters with shaggy locks, clubs, and girdles of ivy leaves,\r\nwho appeared in romance; and Guidon Selvaggio was the rustic knight of\r\nBoiardo and Ariosto. Occasionally these words became names, and about\r\nthe year 1200, Sylvestro Gozzolini, of Osimo, founded an order of monks,\r\nwho, probably, are the cause that Sylvester became known in Ireland as a\r\nChristian name, and has come to us as a surname, while the French have\r\nit as Sylvestre.\r\n\r\nThe son of Æneas and Lavinia was said to have been born in a wood, and\r\ntherefore called Æneas Silvius, and his name was given to one of the\r\nPiccolomini family, Enea Silvio, afterwards pope; and also belonged to\r\nan historian. Sylvain, Sylvan, Sylvius, Sylvia became favourite names\r\nfor shepherds and shepherdesses in the time of the pastoral romance;\r\nSylvia turned into a poetical name for a country maid, and has since\r\nbeen used as a village Christian name, having been perhaps first chosen\r\nby some fanciful Lady Bountiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                      MODERN NAMES FROM THE LATIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere still remain a class of names derived from the Latin, being\r\nchiefly Latin words formed into names. Some of them answer to the class\r\nthat we have called Christian Greek, being compound words assumed as\r\nbefitting names by early Roman Christians, such as Deusvult.\r\n\r\nThere are fewer of these than of the like Greek designations, both from\r\nthe hereditary system of nomenclature, and from the language being less\r\nsuitable for such formations than the Greek, which was so well known to\r\nall educated Romans that a Greek appellation would convey as much\r\nmeaning as a Latin one, and in that partially veiled form that always\r\nseems to have been preferred in nomenclature in the later ages of\r\nnations. Some, however, either from sound, sense, or association, have\r\nbecome permanent Christian names in one or more nations; and with these,\r\nfor the sake of convenience, have been classed those formed from Latin\r\nroots, and which, though coined when their ancestral language was not\r\nonly dead but corrupt, are too universal to be classed as belonging to\r\nany single country of modern Europe, though sometimes the product of a\r\nRomance tongue rather than of genuine Latin, or appearing in cognate\r\nlanguages in different forms; cousins, in fact, not brethren, and\r\nsometimes related to uncles sprung from the elder tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION I.—_From Amo._\r\n\r\nOf these are all the large class of names sprung from _amo_, which has\r\ndescended into all the Southern languages of Western Europe nearly\r\nunaltered. The Gallic Christians seem to have had a particular delight\r\nin calling their children by derivatives of this word; for in their\r\nearly times there occur in the calendar, Amabilis (loveable), Amator (a\r\nlover), Amandus (about to be loved), and Amatus and Amata (loved);\r\nAmadeus (loving God) seems to have been still older. Out of this\r\ncollection, St. Amand has survived as a territorial surname; whilst\r\nAmanda, from its meaning, was one of the complimentary _noms de plume_\r\nof the eighteenth century; and Amandine is sometimes found in France.\r\nAmabilis was a male saint of Riom, known to France as St. Amable;\r\nnevertheless, his name passed to Aimable, the Norman heiress of\r\nGloucester, who so strongly protested against accepting even a king’s\r\nson without a surname. Her name became on English lips Amabel, which has\r\nbeen handed down unchanged in a few old English families, though country\r\nlips have altered it into Mabel, in which form it is still used among\r\nthe northern peasantry. Ignorant etymologists have tried to make it come\r\nfrom _ma belle_ (my fair one), and lovers of false ornament turn it into\r\nMabella.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the female saint, Amata, or Aimée, but that the\r\npeople of Northern France used to honour her, and she had namesakes in\r\nold French pedigrees, so that there can be little doubt that Norman\r\nfamilies brought in the pretty simple Amy that has never been entirely\r\ndisused, and has been a frequent peasant name in the West of England.\r\nSt. Amatus, or Amé, was about the end of the seventh century a hermit in\r\nthe Valais, and afterwards became Bishop of Sion, and was persecuted by\r\none of the Merovingian kings. He thus became the patron saint of Savoy,\r\nand for a long succession the Counts were called Amé; but after a time,\r\nthey altered the name to Amadeus, Amadée, or Amadeo, as it was\r\ndifferently called on the two sides of the mountain principality, and as\r\nit has continued to the present time. Amyot and Amyas in England, and in\r\nRomance the champion Amadis de Gaul, drew their names from this Savoyard\r\nsource. This notable knight is believed to have been invented in Spain,\r\nand the Italians call him Amadigi. It is possible, however, that he may\r\ncome from the Kymry, for Amaethon, son of Don, appears in the\r\n_Mabinogion_, and was a mystic personage in Welsh mythology. His name\r\nmeant the husbandman, another offshoot from the universal Amal. He must\r\nhave been the Sir Amadas of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nThe old English Amicia, so often found in old pedigrees, is probably a\r\nLatinizing of Aimée. The most notable instance of it is Amicia, the\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Leicester, who brought her county to the fierce\r\nold persecutor, Simon de Montfort, and left it to the warlike earl, who\r\nimprisoned Henry III. His sister carried Amicie into the Flemish family\r\nof De Roye, where it continued in use, and it descended again into Amice\r\nin England. Amadore was in use in Florence, cut into Dore.[76]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Max Müller, _Science of Language_; Keightley; Ruskin; Grimm;\r\n  Michaelis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Pott; Dugdale; _Mabinogion_; Lady C. Guest; Dunlop, _Fiction_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION II.—_Names from Beo._\r\n\r\nThe old verb _beo_ (to make happy or bless) formed the participle\r\n_beatus_ (happy or blessed), which was applied by the Church to her\r\ndeparted members, and in time was bestowed on the living. Indeed, in\r\nFrance, _béate_ was so often applied to persons who lived in the\r\nprofession of great sanctity, that _une vieille béate_ has now come to\r\nbe used in the sense of a hypocritical pretender.\r\n\r\nSt. Beatus, or Béat, was an anchorite near Vendôme, in the fifth\r\ncentury; but we do not find instances of his patronage having been\r\nsought for men, though in England Beata is a prevailing female name in\r\nold registers and on tombstones up to the seventeenth century, when it\r\ndies away, having, I strongly suspect, been basely confounded with\r\nBetty. Beata and Bettrys are however still used in Wales. This last\r\nstands for Beatrice (a blesser), which seems to have been first brought\r\ninto this island as a substitute for the Gaelic Bethoc (life), of which\r\nmore in its place.\r\n\r\nThe original Beatrix, the feminine of Beator (a blesser), is said to\r\nhave been first borne by a Christian maiden, who, in Diocletian’s\r\npersecution, drew the bodies of her martyred brothers from the Tiber,\r\nand buried them: afterwards she shared their fate, and her relics were\r\nenshrined in a church at Rome, whence her fame spread to all adjacent\r\ncountries; and her name was already frequent when Dante made the love of\r\nhis youth, Beatrice Portinari, the theme of his _Vita Nuova_, and his\r\nguide through Paradise. Thus it was a truly national name at Florence;\r\nand Shakespeare used the Italian spelling for his high-spirited heroine,\r\nthus leading us to discard the old Latin _x_. It has been a queenly name\r\nin Spain, but less common here than it deserves.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │   Welsh.   │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Spanish.  │\r\n   │Beatrix     │Bettrys     │Béatrix     │Beatrice    │Beatriz     │\r\n   │Trix        │            │            │Bice        │            │\r\n   │Beatrice    │            │            │            │            │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │Portuguese. │  German.   │  Russian.  │ Slavonic.  │            │\r\n   │Beatrix     │Beatrix     │Beatriks    │Beatrica    │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThis same _beo_ is said to be the source of _benus_, the old form of\r\n_bonus_, which survives in the adverb _benè_. Both adjective and adverb\r\nare familiar in their many derivatives in the southern tongues, as well\r\nas in the _bonnie_ and _bien_ that testify to the close connection of\r\nFrance and Scotland when both alike were the foes of England.\r\n\r\nThe feminine Bona, or Bonne, was probably first invented as a\r\ntranslation of the old German Gutha; for we find a lady, in 1315,\r\ndesignated as Bona, or Gutha, of Göttingen. Bona was used by the\r\ndaughters of the Counts of Savoy, and in the House of Luxemburg, and\r\ncame to the crown of France with the daughter of the chivalrous Johann\r\nof Luxemburg, the blind King of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nSt. Benignus, whose name is from the same source, was a disciple of St.\r\nPolycarp, and is reckoned as the apostle of Burgundy, where he was\r\nmartyred, and has been since commemorated by the splendid abbey of St.\r\nBenigne, at Dijon, whence it happens that Benin has been common among\r\nthe peasantry in that part of France, and Benigne is to be found among\r\nthe string of Christian names borne by the French gentry of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Servia has the feminine form,\r\nBenyma, shortening it into Bine.\r\n\r\n_Benedico_ (to speak well) came to have the technical sense of to bless;\r\nand the patriarch of the Western monks rendered Benedictus (blessed) so\r\nuniversally known that different forms of it prevail in all countries,\r\nlesser luminaries adding to its saintly lustre.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    Breton.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Benedict       │Benoît         │Bennéad        │Benedetto      │\r\n   │Bennet         │               │Bennéged       │Betto          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Bettino        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │    German.    │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Benedicto      │Benedicto      │Benedikt       │Bengt          │\r\n   │Benito         │Bento          │Dix            │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Norse.     │    Swiss.     │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Benedik        │Benzel         │Venedict       │Benedykt       │\r\n   │Benike         │Benzli         │               │               │\r\n   │Bent           │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │ Slavonic  and │   Lusatian.   │  Lithuanian.  │     Lapp.     │\r\n   │   Illyrian.   │               │               │               │\r\n   │Benedikt       │Beniesch       │Bendzus        │Pent           │\r\n   │Benedit        │               │Bendikkas      │Penta          │\r\n   │Benko          │   ————————    │   ————————    │Pint           │\r\n   │               │Lett.          │Hungarian.     │Pinna          │\r\n   │               │Bindus         │Benedik        │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThere was a Visigothic nun in Spain canonized as Benedicta, but most of\r\nthe feminines were meant in devotion to the original founder of the\r\nBenedictine rule.

Benvenuto Cellini may perhaps be reckoned as one, unless\r\nhis name be intended to mean welcome without reference to the saint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION III.—_From Clarus._\r\n\r\nClarus (bright or clear) was used by the Romans in the sense of famous,\r\nand St. Clarus is revered as the first bishop of Nantes in Brittany, in\r\nA.D. 280. Another Clarus, said to have been a native of Rochester, was a\r\nhermit, near Rouen, where he was murdered at the instigation of a wicked\r\nwoman who had vainly paid her addresses to him. Two villages of St.\r\nClair, one on the Epte, the other near Coutance, are interesting as\r\nhaving (one or the other of them) named two of the most noted families\r\nin the history of Great Britain, besides the various De St. Clairs of\r\nFrance, who came either from thence or from a third St. Clair in\r\nAquitaine.\r\n\r\nA Norman family, called from one of these villages, became the De\r\nClares. ‘Red De Clare,’ stout Glo’ster’s earl, the foe of Henry III.,\r\nwas one of them; and his son marrying into the house of Geraldin, in\r\nIreland, received from Edward I. a grant of lands in Thomond, now known\r\nfrom his lordship as County Clare. His heiress carried the county to the\r\nDe Burghs, and their heiress again marrying Lionel, son of Edward III.,\r\nthe county becoming a dukedom and royal appanage, was amplified into\r\nClarence, and gave title to Clarencieux—king-at-arms, when Thomas,\r\nbrother of Henry V., was Duke of Clarence—unless this be from Clare, in\r\nSuffolk. Clarence as a male Christian name did not solely arise when\r\nWilliam IV. was Duke of Clarence, but began as early as 1595, when\r\nClarence Babbington was christened at Hartlepool.\r\n\r\nSpanish ballad lore gives a daughter, Clara, to Charlemagne, and a son,\r\nDon Claros de Montablan, to Rinaldo, and of course marries them; but it\r\nis to Italy that the feminine name, so much more universal, is owing.\r\nThe first Chiara on record was the devoted disciple of St. Francis, who,\r\nunder his direction, established the order of women following his rule,\r\nand called, poor Clares, or sisters of St. Clara. From them the name of\r\nClara spread into the adjoining countries, little varied except that the\r\nFrench used to call it Claire, until recently, when they have added the\r\nterminal _a_, just as the English on the other hand are dropping it, and\r\nmaking the word Clare. The Bretons use both masculine and feminine as\r\nSklear, Skleara; and the Finns have the feminine as Lara.\r\n\r\nThe old Latin feminine of words ending in _or_, meaning the doer, was\r\n_ix_—_nutor_, _nutrix_—and this became _ice_ in modern Italian. Thus\r\nClarice was probably intended to mean making famous. A lady thus named\r\nwas the wife of Lorenzo de Medici, and France learnt it probably from\r\nher, but made the _c_ silent; and England, picking it up by ear,\r\nobtained Clarissa, which, when Richardson had so named the heroine of\r\nhis novel, was re-imported into France as Clarisse. Clarinda was another\r\ninvention of the same date.\r\n\r\nEsclairmonde, a magnificent name of romance, the heroine of _Huon de\r\nBourdeaux_, walked into real life with a noble damsel of the house of\r\nFoix, in the year 1229, and was borne by various maidens of that family;\r\nbut who would have thought of two ladies called Clarimond, in\r\nDevonshire, in 1613 and 1630?\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IV.—_Columba._\r\n\r\nColumba is one of the sweetest and most gentle of all words in sound and\r\nsense, yet it has not been in such universal use as might have been\r\nexpected from its reference to the dove of peace.\r\n\r\nA virgin martyr in Gaul, and another in Spain, were both called Columba;\r\nand Columbina must at one time have prevailed in Italy, as a peasant\r\nname, since from the waiting damsel in the impromptu comedies that the\r\npoetical Italians loved to act, it passed to the light-footed maiden of\r\nmodern farce, and now is seldom used save for her and the columbine, the\r\ndove-flower, so called from the resemblance of the curled spurs of its\r\nfour purple petals to doves drinking.\r\n\r\nIt was from his gentle character that Crimthan, the great and admirable\r\nson of the House of Neill, was called Columba, a fitting name for him\r\nwho was truly a dove of peace to the wild Hebrides. In Ireland this good\r\nman is generally called St. Columkill, St. Columb of the cell, or\r\nmonastery, because of the numbers of these centres of Christian\r\ninstruction founded by him, and he is thus distinguished from a second\r\nColumb, called after him. He has, indeed, left strong traces on the\r\nnomenclature of the country that he evangelized. Colin, so frequent\r\namong the Scots of all ranks, is the direct descendant of Columba,\r\nthough it is often confounded with the French Colin, from Nicolas, who\r\nis the chief Colin of modern Arcadia, and perhaps has the best right to\r\nthe feminine invention of Colinette. Besides this, it was the frequent\r\ncustom to be called Gillie-colum and Maol-colm, the disciple, or\r\nshaveling, of Columb, from whence arose Malcolm, one of the most\r\nnational of Scottish names. Colan, probably called after the patron\r\nsaint of the place, was married at St. Columb Magna, in Cornwall, in\r\n1752; but earlier it was Columb for men, Columba for women, both now\r\ndisused.\r\n\r\nColumbanus, another great Irish missionary saint, was probably called,\r\nafter old Latin custom, by the adoptive formed from Columba. His\r\ninfluence on the Continent, newly broken and almost heathenized by the\r\nTeutonic invasions, was so extensive, reaching as it did from Brittany\r\nto Switzerland, and still marked by the relics of Irish art in the books\r\nof the monasteries of his foundation, that we wonder not to find more\r\ntraces of his name. His day, November 1st, is called by the Germans St.\r\nColman’s, and it is thought that the surnames Kohl and Kohlmann are\r\nremains of his name, as well as the French Coulon. So, too, the Genoese\r\nColon was by historians identified with Columbus, when they Latinized\r\nthe mariner who “gave a new world to Spain.” Two spots in that new world\r\nbear his name, that in Terra Firma, where he landed on his third voyage,\r\nand the bishopric newly founded in Vancouver’s Isle.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonian dove is Golubica, a cognate word to this and sometimes\r\nused as a name.[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION V.—_Durans._\r\n\r\nDurans (enduring, or lasting) formed the name which no reader of _Don\r\nQuixote_ can forget as that of the enduring hero, lying on his back on\r\nthe marble tomb, in the cave of Montesinos, who uttered that admirable\r\nsentiment, “Patience, cousin, and shuffle the cards!”\r\n\r\nThe name of Durandus prevailed in other countries; and Durand, to our\r\nsurprise, figures constantly in Domesday Book, probably having belonged\r\nto French immigrants. A Durand and Marta, who jointly owned a house at\r\nWinchester in the reign of Stephen, were almost certainly Provençal,\r\nsince St. Martha was hardly known except in the scene of her exploit\r\nwith the dragon. Durand Grimbald is a specimen of a French Christian and\r\nEnglish surname then prevailing. Durandus is the Latinized surname of\r\nthe great French lawyer of the middle ages; and Durandus again is\r\nfamiliar to the lover of mediæval symbolism; but none of these can\r\napproach in honour the great Florentine Durante Alighieri, whose glory,\r\n_lasting_ like that of Homer and Shakespeare, has made his contracted\r\nappellation of Dante stand alone and singly.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Hanmer, _Ireland_; Chalmer, _Caledonia_; Montalembert;\r\n  _Ossianic Society_; Pott; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION VI.—_Names of Thankfulness._\r\n\r\nA great race of Christian names were fabricated, in Latin, after the\r\npattern of the Greek Theophilus, Theophorus, &c., though hardly with\r\nequal felicity, and chiefly in the remoter provinces of the West, where\r\nLatin was, probably, a matter of scholarship. Thus, in the province of\r\nAfrica, we find, just before the Vandal invasion, Quodvultdeus (what God\r\nwills) and Deogratias (thank God), neither of which had much chance of\r\nsurviving. Deusvult (God wills), Deusdedit (God gave), and Adeodatus,\r\nlived nearer to Italy; indeed, Deusdedit was a pope. Adeodatus or\r\nDeodatus (God given) was a Gallic saint, called, commonly, St. Die, and\r\nwith the other form, Donum Dei, continued in use for children whose\r\nbirth was hailed with special joy. When Louis VII. of France at length\r\nhad a son, after being “afflicted with a multitude of daughters,” he\r\ncalled him Philippe Dieudonné; but this grateful name was discarded in\r\nfavour of the imperial Auguste, by which he is distinguished. Deodati di\r\nGozo, the Knight of Rhodes who slew the dragon, better kept his\r\nbaptismal name, and it often occurs in Italian history, and is an\r\nItalian surname. Deodatus is an occasional name only found in England.\r\nThe old French knightly name, Dudon, called in Italian romantic poetry\r\nDudone, is, probably, a contraction of Dieudonné, as the surnames\r\nDonnedieu, Dondey, Dieudé, can hardly fail to be. Deicola (a worshipper\r\nof God) was invented for a pupil of St. Columbanus, who followed his\r\nmaster to France, lived as a hermit, and became the patron-saint of\r\nFranche Comté, where boys are still called, after him, Diel or Diez, and\r\ngirls, Dielle. There is likewise an Italian name Diotisalvi, or God save\r\nthee, only to be paralleled by some of our Puritan devices.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added Donatus (given), which evidently was bestowed in\r\nthe same spirit, though not mentioning the giver. It occurs, like most\r\nof this class, in the African province, and belonged to the bishop of\r\nNumidia, whose rigour against the penitent lapsed made him the founder\r\nof the exclusive schismatical church named after him. Another Donatus\r\nwas St. Jerome’s tutor; and, before his time, several martyrs had been\r\ncanonized by his name, and it seems to have prevailed in Gaul and\r\nBritain. In Wales it was pronounced Dynawd; and, by the time St.\r\nAugustine came to England and disputed with the Cymric clergy, the\r\nhistory of the word had been so far forgotten that Dynawd, abbot of\r\nBangor-Iscoed, was Latinized into Dionothius. Donat, or Donath, is found\r\nin Ireland, but it was probably there adopted for the sake of its\r\nresemblance to the native Gaelic Don, meaning brown-haired. Donato,\r\nlikewise, at one time prevailed in Italy, and produced the frequent\r\nsurname, Donati. Donnet was a feminine in Cornwall in 1755.\r\n\r\nDesiderius, or Desideratus, was of the same date, and given, in like\r\nmanner, to express the longing desire or love of the parents towards the\r\nchild. In fact the word _desiderium_, in Latin, more properly means\r\naffection than wish, as we explain its derivatives in modern languages.\r\nThe Desiderius of history was a brother of Magnentius, the opponent of\r\nConstantine, and the Desiderius of the calendar was a bishop of Bourges,\r\nin the seventh century; but, in the mean time, the last Lombard king of\r\nItaly either had become so Italianized as to adopt it, or else used it\r\nas a translation of one of the many Teuton forms of Leofric, Leofwin,\r\n&c., for he was known to Italy as Desiderio, to France as Didier; and\r\nhis daughter, whom Charlemagne treated so shamefully, was Desiderata,\r\nDesirata, or Desirée. The latter has continued in use in France, as well\r\nas Didier and Didiere; and the masculine likewise appears in the\r\nSlavonic countries as Zljeko, and among the Lithuanians as Didders or\r\nSidders.\r\n\r\nThe most learned men were not perfect philologists in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when they played the most curious tricks with their names.\r\nErasmus began life as Gerhard Gerhardson, signifying, in fact, firm\r\nspear, a meaning little suited to his gentle, timid nature. He was\r\nbetter pleased to imagine _ger_ to be the German all, and _ard_ to be\r\n_erd_ (earth or nature); of this all-nature he made out that affection\r\nembraced all, therefore he called himself Desiderius, and then, wanting\r\nanother equally sounding epithet, he borrowed Erasmus from the Greek,\r\nwhere it had named an ancient bishop. It came from ἐράω (to love); and\r\nthus Desiderius Erasmus, the appellation by which he has come down to\r\nposterity, was an ingenious manufacture out of the simple Gerard.[78]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Pott; Butler; Sismondi; _Life of Erasmus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VII.—_Crescens, &c._\r\n\r\nThe verb _cresco_ (to increase or grow) has descended into all our\r\nmodern languages. It has formed the French _croître_ (to grow), our\r\n_increase_ and _decrease_, and our _crescent_. Its participle was\r\nalready adopted as a name in St. Paul’s time, at least it is thus that\r\nhis companion, Κρήσκης, is rendered, who had departed to Dalmatia; and a\r\nlater Crescens is said to have brought about the death of Justin Martyr,\r\nin the second century. The occasion, however, of the modern name was one\r\nof the many holy women of Sicily—Crescentia, a Christian nurse, who\r\nbred-up her charge, the infant Vitus, in her own faith, fled with him to\r\nItaly, and was there seized and martyred, under Diocletian. Crescenzia,\r\nand the masculine, Crescenzio, prevail in both Naples and Sicily; and\r\nthe election of the Angevin-Sicilian Carobert, to the throne of Hungary,\r\ncarried the former thither as Czenzi; whence Bavaria took it as Cresenz,\r\nZenz, Zenzl.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION VIII.—_Military Names._\r\n\r\nIn the slender thread of connection with which we try to unite names\r\ngiven in the same spirit, we put together those that seem to have\r\naccorded with the tastes of the Roman army.\r\n\r\nThus _eligo_ (to choose), which originally caused the title of Legion,\r\nwas in the participle _electus_, and thus led to words most familiar to\r\nus in the state as political terms, to the theological term elect or\r\nchosen for salvation.\r\n\r\nThere is some doubt whether St. John’s third epistle be indeed to a lady\r\ncalled Electa, or to an elect lady, as it is in our version; but when a\r\nname from this source next appears, it is among the cultivated\r\nGallo-Romans, when they had gradually worked their way to consideration\r\namong the rude Franks, who had nearly trodden out civilization in the\r\nconquered country. Eligius was the great goldsmith bishop who designed\r\nKing Dagobert’s throne, made shrines for almost all the distinguished\r\nrelics in France, and doubtless enjoyed the fame of having made many\r\nmore than could have come from his hand. He is popularly called St.\r\nEloy, and some derive from him the Provençal Aloys; but this is far more\r\nprobably a southern form of Hlodweh, or Louis.\r\n\r\nThe Roman veterans were termed _emeriti_ (having deserved) from _mereor_\r\n(to deserve). From these old soldiers must have come the name\r\nEmerentius, which is to be found as Emerenz in Germany, and Emérence in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nSt. Emerentiana was said to have been a catechumen, who was killed by\r\nsoldiers who found her praying on the tomb of St. Agnes. Her name\r\n(probably her relics) passed to Denmark, and to Lithuania, where it is\r\ncalled Marenze, and Embrance is the old English feminine.\r\n\r\nThe very contrary, Pacifico (peaceful), is a modern Italian and Spanish\r\nname—as Peace is Puritan.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we place that which the soldier most esteems—_honos_, or\r\n_honor_. Honor was a deity in later Rome, but no old classical names\r\nwere made from him, and Honorius first appears as one of the\r\nappellations of the Spanish father of the great Theodosius; then again\r\ninherited by that imbecile being, his grandson, the last genuine Roman\r\nemperor; also by a niece, called Justa Grata Honoria, who dishonoured\r\nall her three honourable names. Yet some lingering sense of allegiance\r\nto the last great family that gave rulers to the empire perpetuated\r\ntheir names in the countries where they had reigned; and the Welsh Ynyr\r\nlong remained as a relic of Honorius, in Wales. Honorine was a Neustrian\r\nmaiden, slain in a Danish invasion, and regarded as a martyr; so that\r\nHonorine prevails in France and Germany, and one of the favourite modern\r\nIrish names, is Onora, Honor, or in common usage, Norah.\r\n\r\nRussia has the masculine as Gonorij; Lithuania, the feminine cut down\r\ninto Arri. There were two Gallic bishops named Honoratus, whence the\r\nFrench Honoré, which has named a suburb of Paris, and we had one early\r\narchbishop of Canterbury so called, from whom we have derived no names,\r\nthough Honor was revived in England in the days of names of abstract\r\nqualities, and Honoria was rather in fashion in the last century,\r\nprobably as an ornamental form of the Irish Norah.[79]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Smith, _Antiquities_; Le Beau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION IX.—_Names of Gladness._\r\n\r\nA large class of names of joy belonging to the later growth of the Latin\r\ntongue may be thrown together; and first those connected with the word\r\n_jocus_, which seems to have arisen from the inarticulate shout of\r\necstasy that all know, but none can spell, ἰουας (in Greek), and with us\r\njoy, the French _joie_, and Italian _gioia_.\r\n\r\nThe original cry is preserved in the Swiss _jodel_, or shout of the\r\nmountaineers, and this indeed seems to be the sound naturally rising\r\nfrom the cries that peal from one hill to another, for here the Eastern\r\nmeets the Western tongue. The sound at which the walls of Jericho fell,\r\nwas called the Yobêl; and the fifty years' festival of release,\r\ninaugurated with trumpet sounds, was the Yobêl (the jubilee). _Jubilo_\r\n(to call aloud), already a Latin word, also from the sound of the shout\r\nand exultation, had been connected with it even before the _annum\r\njubileum_ had come in from the Hebrews.\r\n\r\n_Giubilare_ and _Giubileo_ made themselves at home in Italian, while\r\nGerman, either from the Latin or its own resources, took its own word\r\n_jubel_. Giubileo was probably born in the year of a jubilee.\r\n\r\nFrom _jocus_ came Jodocus, an Armorican prince, belonging to a family\r\nwhich migrated from Wales. He refused the sovereignty of Brittany, to\r\nlive as a hermit in Ponthieu, where he is still remembered as St. Josse,\r\nand named at least three villages, perhaps also forming Josselin; but in\r\nhis native Brittany, Judicael, an old princely name, seems to have been\r\nthe form of his commemoration. In _Domesday Book_ we find Judicael\r\n_Venator_ already a settler in England before the conquest, probably\r\nbrought by the Confessor. Germany accepted this as a common peasant\r\nname, as Jost, or Jobs; Bavaria, as Jobst, or Jodel; Italy, as Giodoco;\r\nand the feminine, Jodoca, is not yet extinct in Wales.\r\n\r\nNeither is the very similar Jocosa, once not uncommon among English\r\nladies, by whom it was called Joyce. The contractions of this name are,\r\nhowever, almost inextricably confused with those of Justus. Joy stands\r\nalone as one of our abstract virtue names.\r\n\r\nAnother word very nearly related to our own glad, is _gaudium_ (joy),\r\nstill preserved in the adjective gaudy, and in gaudy (the festival day)\r\nof a college. It named St. Gaudentius, whence the Italian Gaudenzio, and\r\nthe old German name of Geila.\r\n\r\n_Hilaris_ (cheerful) formed Hilarius, whence was called the great doctor\r\nof the Gallican Church, known to us as St. Hilary, of Poitiers; and to\r\nFrance, as St. Hilaire. A namesake was the Neustrian hermit who made\r\nJersey his abode, and thus named St. Helier; and moreover the Welsh\r\ncalled those who traditionally had been named Hilarius, first Ilar, then\r\nElian; and then thought they had found their patron in the Greek\r\nÆlianus.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Russian.  │  Frisian.  │\r\n   │Hilary      │Hilaire     │Ilario      │Gilarij     │Laris       │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nPortugal likewise has Hilariāo, and Russia Hilarion; and the feminine,\r\nHilaria, was once used in England, and is still the Russian Ilaria, and\r\nSlovak Milari.\r\n\r\n_Lætus_ (glad) formed the substantive _lætitia_, which was turned into a\r\nname by the Italians as Letizia, probably during the thirst for novelty\r\nthat prevailed in the Cinque-cento; and then, likewise, Lettice seems to\r\nhave arisen in England, and must have become known in Ireland when\r\nLettice Knollys was the wife of the Earl of Essex. Thence Letitia, or\r\nLetty, have been common among Irishwomen.\r\n\r\nProsperus, from the Latin _prosper_, formed of _pro_ and _spero_, so as\r\nto mean favourable hope, formed the mediæval Roman Prospero, of which\r\nShakespeare must have heard through the famous condottiere, Prospero\r\nColonna, when he bestowed it upon his wondrous magician Duke of\r\nMilan.[80]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  Kitto, _Bible Cyclopædia_; Butler; Pott; Michaelis; Dugdale; Petre\r\n  Chevalier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION X.—_Jus._\r\n\r\n_Jus_ (right), and _juro_ (to swear), are intimately connected, and have\r\nderivatives in all languages, testifying to the strong impression made\r\nby the grand system of Roman law.\r\n\r\n_Justus_, the adjective which we render as just, named the Gallic St.\r\nJustus, or St. Juste, of Lyons; also the Dutch Jost; Italian Giusto; and\r\nPortuguese Justo.\r\n\r\nJusta was a virgin martyr, but her fame was far exceeded by that of\r\nJustina, who suffered at Padua, and became the patron saint of that\r\ncity, whose university made its peculiarities everywhere known. The\r\npurity of St. Justina caused her emblem to be the unicorn, since that\r\ncreature is said to brook no rule but that of a spotless maiden; and\r\npoison always became manifest at the touch of its horn, for which the\r\ntwisted weapon of the narwhal did duty in collections. The great battle\r\nof Lepanto was fought on St. Justina’s day, and the victory was by the\r\nVenetians attributed to her intercession; so that Giustina at Venice,\r\nJustine in France, came for the time into the foremost ranks of\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nThe noted Justinus, whom we call Justin Martyr, was one of the greatest\r\nof the early writers of the Church, meeting the heathen philosophers\r\nupon their own ground in argument, and bequeathing to us our first\r\npositive knowledge of Christian observances. From him the name was\r\nwidely spread in the Church; and Yestin was one of the many old Roman\r\nnames that lingered on long among the Welsh. Justin was frequent in\r\nFrance and Germany, and has become confused in its contractions with\r\nJodocus. Josse and Josselin seem to have been used for both in France;\r\nand from the latter we obtained the Joscelin, or Joycelin, once far more\r\ncommon in England than at present. The Swiss Jost and Jostli are\r\nlikewise doubtful between the two names.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, the name of Justin has been adopted in the M'Carthy family,\r\nas a translation of the native Saerbrethach (the noble judge).[81]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Cave, _Lives of the Fathers_; Jameson; _Irish Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION XI.—_Names of Holiness._\r\n\r\nThe infants whom Herod massacred at Bethlehem were termed in Latin\r\n_innocentes_, from _in_ (not), and _noceo_ (to hurt). These harmless\r\nones were revered by the Church from the first, and honoured on the\r\nthird day after Christmas as martyrs in deed. The relics of the Holy\r\nInnocents were great favourites in the middle ages, and are to be found\r\nas frequently as griffins' eggs in the list of treasures at Durham; but\r\nnames taken from them are almost exclusively Roman. A lawyer of the time\r\nof Constantine was called Innocentius, and a Pope contemporary with St.\r\nChrysostom handed it on to his successors, many of whom have\r\nsubsequently assumed this title, and are called by their subjects\r\nInnocenzio.\r\n\r\nPius, applied at first to faithful filial love, as in the case of Æneas,\r\nassumed a higher sense with Christianity, and from being an occasional\r\nagnomen, became the name of a martyr Pope, under Antoninus Pius, and\r\nthus passed on to be one of the papal appellations most often in use,\r\ncalled Pio at Rome, and generally left to the pontiffs, though the\r\nfeminine Pia is occasionally used in Italy. The Puritans indulged in\r\nPiety, and it still sometimes occurs in England, as well as Patience and\r\nPrudence, though the givers are little aware that there were saints long\r\nago thus called, St. Patiens, of Lyons, and St. Prudentius, the great\r\nChristian poet of primitive times.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we have Modesty, or Moddy, as a Puritan name in England,\r\ntaken from the abstract virtue, while the peasant women of Southern\r\nFrance are christened Modestine, probably in honour of a Roman martyr\r\ncalled Modestus, who was put to death at Bezières. Indeed, Modestinus\r\nand Modestus were both in use even in the earlier Roman times, and were\r\nunderstood by those who first bore them not in the sense of\r\n‘shamefastness,’ but of moderation or discretion, the word coming from\r\n_modus_ (a measure).\r\n\r\nTo these, perhaps, should be added that which Italy and Spain have\r\npresumed to form from that title of the Blessed Saviour, Salvatore, or\r\nSalvador, the latter more common in South America than in the Old World.\r\n\r\n_Cœlum_ (heaven) formed, in late Latin, _Cœlestinus_, the name of one of\r\nthe popes who was martyred, and afterwards canonized, and imitated by\r\nseveral successors, whence the French learned the two modern feminines,\r\nCeleste and Celestine.\r\n\r\n_Restitutus_ (restored), from _re_ and _sisto_, seems as if it could be\r\ngiven only in a Christian sense, as to one restored to a new life; yet\r\nits first owner known to us was a friend of Pliny, and an orator under\r\nTrajan. It came to Britain, and is found in Wales as Restyn.\r\n\r\nMelior (better), is a Cornish female name, probably an imitation of some\r\nold Keltic one. It is found as early as 1574.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION XII.—_Ignatius._\r\n\r\nIgnatius is a difficult name to explain. Its associations are with the\r\nEastern Church; but it occurs at a time when Latin names prevailed as\r\nmuch as Greek ones in the Asiatic portions of the Roman empire, and thus\r\nthe Latin _ignis_ (fire) is, perhaps, the most satisfactory derivation,\r\nthough it is not unlikely that the word may come from the source both of\r\nthis and of the Greek ἁγνός, purity and flame being always linked\r\ntogether in Indo-European ideas.\r\n\r\nThe birth-place of the great St. Ignatius is unknown, but tradition has\r\nmarked him as the child whom our Lord set in the midst of His disciples,\r\nand he is known to have been the pupil of St. John, ordained by St.\r\nPeter, and at the end of his long episcopate at Antioch, he was martyred\r\nat Rome by command of Trajan, writing on his last journey the Epistles\r\nthat are among the earliest treasures of the Church. So much is his\r\nmemory revered in his own city, that to the present day the schismatic\r\npatriarchs of Antioch of the Monophysite sect uniformly assume the name\r\nof Ignatius on their election to their see.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church has continued to make much use of this name, called in\r\nRussia Ignatij, Eegnatie, or Ignascha; and in the Slovak dialect cut\r\nshort into Nace. The Spanish Church likewise adopted it in early times,\r\nand among the Navarrese counts and lords of Biscay, as far back as 750,\r\nwe encounter both men and women called Iñigo and Iñiga, or more commonly\r\nEneco and Eneca, used indifferently with the other form, and then\r\nLatinized into Ennicus and Ennica.\r\n\r\nNavarre preserved the name, and it was a Navarrese gentleman, Don Iñigo\r\nLoyola, who, while recovering from his wounds, after the siege of\r\nPampeluna, so read the lives of the saints as to become penetrated with\r\nenthusiasm as fiery as his name. Where the Jesuits have had their will\r\nmay be read in the frequency of this renewed Iñigo, or Ignace, as it was\r\nin France, Ignaz in Roman Catholic Germany. It is Bohemia, where the\r\nonce strong spirit of Protestantism was trodden out in blood and flame,\r\nthat Ignaz is common enough to have turned into Hynek, and in Bavaria\r\nthat it becomes Nazi and Nazrl.\r\n\r\nOur English architect, whose name is associated with the unhappy medley\r\nof Greek and Gothic which was the Stuart imitation of the Cinque-cento\r\nstyle, was a Roman Catholic, and was no doubt christened in honour of\r\nLoyola. The few stray specimens of Inigo to be found occasionally in\r\nEngland are generally traceable to him; one occurs at St. Columb Major,\r\nin 1740.[82]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  Michaelis; Cave; Stanley, _Lectures on the Eastern Church_; Mariana,\r\n  _Istoria de España_; Anderson, _Royal Genealogies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XIII.—_Pater._\r\n\r\nThe word _pater_, which, as we have already shown, is one of those that\r\nmake the whole world kin, was the source of _patria_ (the father-land),\r\nand of far too many words in all tongues to recount. _Patres Conscripti_\r\nwas the title of the senators, and the _patricii_, the privileged class\r\nof old Rome, were so called as descendants from the original thirty\r\n_patres_. _Patricius_ (the noble) was as a title given half in jest to\r\nthe young Roman-British Calpurnius, who was stolen by Irish pirates in\r\nhis youth, and when ransomed, returned again to be the apostle of his\r\ncaptors, and left a name passionately revered in that warm-hearted land.\r\nThe earlier Irish, however, were far too respectful to their apostle to\r\ncall themselves by his name, but were all Mael-Patraic, the shaveling,\r\nor pupil of Patrick, or Giolla-Patraic, the servant of Patrick. This\r\nlatter, passing to Scotland with the mission of St. Columba, turned into\r\nthe Gospatric, or Cospatrick, the boy (gossoon or _garçon_) of Patrick,\r\nEarls of Galloway; and in both countries the surname Gilpatrick, or\r\nKilpatrick, has arisen from it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards these nations left off the humble prefix, and came to calling\r\nthemselves Phadrig in Ireland, Patrick in Scotland; the former so\r\nuniversally as to render Pat and Paddy the national soubriquet. Latterly\r\na bold attempt has been made in Ireland to unite Patrick and Peter as\r\nthe same, so as to have both patron saints at once, but the Irish will\r\nhardly persuade any one to accept it but themselves. The Scotch Pate, or\r\nPatie, is frequent, though less national; and the feminine, Patricia,\r\nseems to be a Scottish invention. The fame of the curious cave, called\r\nSt. Patrick’s Purgatory, brought pilgrims from all quarters, and\r\nPatrice, Patrizio, and Patricio, all are known in France, Italy, and\r\nSpain, the latter the most frequently. Even Russia has Patrikij.\r\n\r\nPaternus (the fatherly) was the Latin name of two Keltic saints, one\r\nArmorican, the other of Avranches, where he is popularly called Saint\r\nPari.[83]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION XIV.—_Grace, &c._\r\n\r\nThe history of the word _grace_ is curious. We are apt to confuse it\r\nwith the Latin _gracilis_ (slender), with which it has no connection,\r\nand which only in later times acquired the sense of elegant, whereas it\r\noriginally meant lean, or wasted, and came from a kindred word to the\r\nGreek γράω (grao), to consume.\r\n\r\n_Grates_, on the contrary, were thanks, whence what was done _gratiis_,\r\nor _gratis_, was for thanks and nothing else, according to our present\r\nuse of the word—whence our gratuitous. So again _gratus_ applied to him\r\nwho was thankful, and to what inspired thanks; and _gratia_ was favour,\r\nor bounty, and was used to render the Greek χάρις; and thus have the\r\nGreek Charities come down to us as Graces. Then, too, he was _gratiosus_\r\nwho possessed the free spirit of bounty and friendliness, exactly\r\nexpressed by our gracious; but, in Italy, it was degraded into mere\r\nlively good-nature, till _un grazioso_ is little better than a buffoon;\r\nand _gracieux_ in France means scarcely more than engaging.\r\n\r\n_Gratia_ was used by early Latin writers for divine favour, whence the\r\ntheological meaning of grace. And from _grates_ (thanks) comes our\r\nexpression of “saying grace before meat.”\r\n\r\nThe English name of Grace is intended as the abstract theological term,\r\nand was adopted with many others of like nature at the Reformation. Its\r\ncontinuation after the dying away of most of its congeners is owing to\r\nthe Irish, who thought it resembled their native _Grainé_ (love), and\r\nthereupon adopted it so plentifully that Grace or Gracie is generally to\r\nbe found wherever there is an Irish connection.\r\n\r\nSpain likewise has Engracia in honour of a maiden cruelly tortured to\r\ndeath at Zaragoza, in 304; and Italy, at least in Lamartine’s pretty\r\nromance, knows Graziella.\r\n\r\nGratianus (favourable) rose among the later Romans, and belonged to the\r\nfather and to the son of the Emperor Valens, and it left the Italians\r\nGraziano for the benefit of Nerissa’s merry husband.\r\n\r\n_Pulcher_ (fair) turned into a name in late days, and came as Pulcheria\r\nto that noble lady on whom alone the spirit of her grandfather\r\nTheodosius in all his family descended. She was canonized, and Pulcheria\r\nthus was a recognized Greek name; but it has been little followed except\r\nin France, where Chérie is the favourite contraction.\r\n\r\n_Spes_ (hope) is the only one of the Christian graces in Latin who has\r\nformed any modern names; and these are the Italian Sperata (hoped for),\r\nand Speranza (hope). Esperanza in Spain, and Espérance in France, have\r\nbeen made Christian names.\r\n\r\n_Delicia_ (delightful) is an English name used in numerous families, and\r\nLanguedoc has the corresponding Mesdelices, shortened into Médé, so that\r\nMademoiselle Mesdélices is apt to be called Misé Médé in her own\r\ncountry. In Italy, Delizia is used.\r\n\r\n_Dulcis_ (sweet, or mild) is explained by Spanish authors to have been\r\nthe origin of their names of Dulcia, Aldoncia, Aldonça, Adoncia, all\r\nfrequent among the Navarrese and Catalonian princesses from 900 to 1200,\r\nso that it was most correct of Don Quixote to translate his Aldonça\r\nLorenço into the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso. Probably the Moorish\r\narticle was added by popular pronunciation in Spain, while Dulcia\r\nlingered in the South of France, became Douce, and came to England as\r\nDucia in the time of the Conqueror, then turned into Dulce, and\r\nby-and-by embellished into Dulcibella, and then by Henry VIII.’s time\r\nfell into Dowsabel, a name borne by living women, as well as by the wife\r\nof Dromio. Dousie Moor, widow, was buried in 1658, at Newcastle.[84]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  Arnold; Hanmer; _Irish Society_; Lower.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Facciolati; Butler; Bowles, _Don Quixote con Annotaciones_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION XV.—_Vinco._\r\n\r\nThe verb _vinco_ (to conquer), the first syllable the same as our _win_,\r\nformed the present participle _vincens_, whence the name Vincentius\r\n(conquering), which was borne by two martyrs of the tenth persecution,\r\none at Zaragoza, the other at Agen; and later by one of the great\r\necclesiastical authors at Lerius, in Provence. Thus Vincent, Vincente,\r\nVincenzio, were national in France, Spain, and Italy, before the more\r\nmodern saints, Vincente Ferrer, and Vincent de St. Paul, had enhanced\r\nits honours.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Spanish.  │  Italian.  │  German.   │\r\n   │Vincent     │Vincent     │Vincente    │Vincenzio   │Vincenz     │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │ Bavarian.  │  Russian.  │  Polish.   │ Bohemian.  │ Hungarian. │\r\n   │Zenz        │Vikentij    │Vincentij   │Vincenc     │Vincze      │\r\n   │Zenzel      │            │            │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nEven the modern Greeks have it as Binkentios.\r\n\r\nConquest is a word found in all classes of names,—the Sieg of the\r\nTeuton, the Nikos of the Greek.\r\n\r\nThe past participle is _victus_; whence the conqueror is Victor—a name\r\nof triumph congenial to the spirit of early Christianity, and borne by\r\nan early pope as well as by more than one martyr, from whom Vittore\r\ndescended as rather a favourite Italian name, though not much used\r\nelsewhere till the French Revolution, when Victor came into fashion in\r\nFrance. Tollo is the Roman contraction, as is Tolla of the feminine.\r\n\r\nThe original Victoria was a Roman virgin, martyred in the Decian\r\npersecution; whence the Italian Vittoria, borne by the admirable\r\ndaughter of the Colonne, from whom France and Germany seem to have\r\nlearned it, since after her time Victoire and Victorine became very\r\ncommon in France; and it was from Germany that we learnt the Victoria\r\nthat will, probably, sound hereafter like one of our most national\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION XVI.—_Vita._\r\n\r\n_Vita_ (life) was used by the Roman Christians to express their hopes of\r\neternity; and an Italian martyr was called Vitalis, whence the modern\r\nItalian Vitale and German Veitel.\r\n\r\nVitalianus, a name formed out of this, is hardly to be recognized in the\r\nWelsh form of Gwethalyn.\r\n\r\nVivia, from _vivus_ (alive), was the first name of Vivia Perpetua, the\r\nnoble young matron of Carthage, whose martyrdom, so circumstantially\r\ntold, is one of the most grand and most affecting histories in the\r\nannals of the early Church. Her other name of Perpetua has, however,\r\nbeen chosen by her votaresses.\r\n\r\nVivianus and Viviana were names of later Roman days, often, in the West,\r\npronounced with a _B_, and we find a Christian maiden, named Bibiana,\r\nput to death by a Roman governor, under Julian the Apostate, under\r\npretence of her having destroyed one of his eyes by magic, a common\r\nexcuse for persecution in the days of pretended toleration. A church was\r\nbuilt over her remains as early as 465, and, considering the accusation\r\nagainst her, it is curious to find Vyvyan or Viviana the enchantress of\r\nKing Arthur’s court.\r\n\r\nVivian has been a name for both sexes, and a Scottish Vivian Wemyss,\r\nbishop of Fife in 615, was canonized, and known to Rome as St. Bibianus.\r\n\r\nVitus was the child whom St. Crescentia bred up a Christian, and who\r\ndied in Lucania with her. His day was the 15th of June, and had the\r\nreputation of entailing thirty days of similar weather to its own.\r\n\r\nVitus is Vita, in Bohemia; Vida, in Hungary; Veicht and Veidl, in\r\nBavaria; and is used to Latinize Guy; but it is probable that this last\r\nis truly Celtic, and it shall be treated of hereafter.[85]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Fleury, _Histoire Ecclesiastique_; Butler; Villemarque, _Romans de la\r\n  Table Ronde_; Roscoe, _Boiardo_; Brand, _Popular Antiquities_; Grimm;\r\n  Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION XVII.—_Wolves and Bears._\r\n\r\nThe Roman _lupus_ had truly a right to stand high in Roman estimation,\r\nconsidering the good offices of the she-wolf to the founder, and the\r\nwolf and the twins will continue an emblem as long as Rome stands, in\r\nspite of the explanation that declared that the nurse was either named\r\nLupa, or so called, because the Roman word applied to a woman of bad\r\ncharacter, and in spite of the later relegation of the entire tale to\r\nthe realms of mythology. Lupus was accordingly a surname in the Rutilian\r\ngens, and was borne by many other Romans, thus descending to the three\r\nRomanized countries. St. Lupus, or Loup of Troyes, curiously enough\r\nsucceeded St. Ursus, or Ours, and was notable both for his confutation\r\nof the Pelagian heresy, and for having saved his diocese by his\r\nintercession with Attila. Another sainted Lupus, or Loup, was Bishop of\r\nLyons. Italy has the Christian name of Lupo; Portugal, Lobo; Spain,\r\nLope. The great poet, Lope de Vega, might be translated, the wolf of the\r\nmeadow.\r\n\r\nThe bear was not in any remarkable favour at Rome; but the semi-Romans\r\nadopted Ursus as rather a favourite among their names. Ursus and Ursinus\r\nwere early Gallic bishops; whence the Italian Orso and Orsino, the\r\nlatter becoming the surname of the celebrated Roman family of Orsini.\r\nOurs is very common in Switzerland, in compliment to the bears of Berne.\r\n\r\nAn old myth of the little bear and the stars seems to have been turned\r\ninto the legend of Cologne, of Ursula, the Breton maiden who, on her way\r\nto her betrothed British husband, was shipwrecked on the German coast,\r\nand slain by Attila, King of the Huns, with 11,000 virgin companions.\r\nSome say that the whole 11,000 rose out of the V. M. for virgin martyr;\r\nothers give her one companion, named Undecimilla, and suppose that this\r\nwas translated into the 11,000. Skulls and bones, apparently from an old\r\ncemetery, are shown at Cologne, and their princess’s name has been\r\nfollowed by various ladies.\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐\r\n │        French.        │       Swiss.        │       Italian.        │\r\n │Ours                   │Ours                 │Orso                   │\r\n │                       │Orsvch               │Ursilo                 │\r\n │                       │                     │Ursello                │\r\n ├───────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴───────────────────────┤\r\n │                              FEMININE                               │\r\n ├────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┤\r\n │    English.    │     French.     │    Spanish.     │  Portuguese.   │\r\n │Ursula          │Ursule           │Ursola           │Ursula          │\r\n │Ursel           │   ——————————    │                 │                │\r\n │Ursley          │     Dutch.      │                 │                │\r\n │Nullie          │Orseline         │                 │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │    Italian.    │     German.     │     Swiss.      │    Russian.    │\r\n │Orsola          │Ursel            │Orscheli         │Urssula         │\r\n │                │Urschel          │Urschel          │                │\r\n │                │                 │Urschla          │                │\r\n ├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────┤\r\n │    Polish.     │    Slavonic.    │    Lusatian.    │   Hungarian.   │\r\n │Urszula         │Ursa             │Wursla           │Orsolya         │\r\n │   ——————————   │                 │Hoscha           │                │\r\n │   Bohemian.    │                 │Oscha            │                │\r\n │Worsula         │                 │                 │                │\r\n ├────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┤\r\n │                             DIMINUTIVE.                             │\r\n ├───────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────────────┤\r\n │        Roman.         │       French.       │        Polish.        │\r\n │Ursino                 │Ursin                │Ursyn                  │\r\n └───────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n            SECTION XVIII.—_Names from Places and Nations._\r\n\r\nThe fashion of forming names from the original birthplace was\r\nessentially Roman. Many cognomina had thus risen; but a few more must be\r\nadded of too late a date to fall under the usual denominations of the\r\nearlier classical names.\r\n\r\nThe island of Cyprus must at some time have named the family of Thascius\r\nCyprianus, that great father of African birth, who was so noted as\r\nBishop of Carthage; but though Cyprian is everywhere known, it is\r\nnowhere common, and is barely used at Rome as Cipriano. In 1811, Ciprian\r\nwas baptized in Durham cathedral; but then he was the son of the\r\ndivinity lecturer, which accounts for the choice.\r\n\r\nNeapolis, from the universal Greek word for _new_, and the Greek πόλις\r\n(a city), was the term bestowed as frequently by the Greeks as Newtown\r\nis by Keltic influence, or Newby and Newburgh by Teutonic. One Neapolis\r\nwas the ancient Sychar, and another was that which is still known as\r\nNapoli or Naples.\r\n\r\nFrom some of these ‘new cities’ was called an Alexandrian martyr, whose\r\ncanonized fame caused him to be adopted as patron by one of the Roman\r\nfamily of Orsini, in the course of the twelfth century. Neapolion,\r\nNeapolio, or Napoleone, continued to be used in that noble house, and\r\nspread from them to other parts of Italy, and thence to Corsica, where\r\nhe received it who was to raise it to become a word of terror to all\r\nEurope, and of passionate enthusiasm to France, long after, in\r\nschool-boy fashion, at Brienne, its owner had been discontented with its\r\nsingularity.\r\n\r\nThe city of Sidon formed the name Sidonius, which was borne by Caius\r\nSollius Apollinaris Sidonius, one of the most curious characters of the\r\ndark ages, a literary and married bishop of Clermont, in the fifth\r\ncentury, an honest and earnest man, but so little according to the\r\nordinary type of ecclesiastical sanctity, that nothing is more\r\nsurprising than to find him canonized, and in possession of the 23rd of\r\nAugust for a feast day. It is curious, too, that his namesakes should be\r\nladies. Sidonie is not uncommon in France; and, in 1449, Sidonia, or\r\nZedena, is mentioned as daughter to George Podiebrand, of Silesia; and\r\nSidonia, of Bavaria, appears in 1488.\r\n\r\nFrom the city of Lydia was named the seller of purple who hearkened to\r\nSt. Paul at Thyatira, and to her is owing the prevalence of Lydia among\r\nEnglish women delighting in Scriptural names.\r\n\r\nTo these should be added, as belonging to the same class, though the\r\nword is Greek, Anatolius, meaning a native of Anatolia, the term applied\r\nin later times by the Greeks to Asia Minor, and meaning the sunrise. St.\r\nAnatolius, of Constantinople, was one of the sacred poets of the Greek\r\nChurch; and after his death, in 458, his name and its feminine,\r\nAnatolia, became frequent in the countries where his hymns were used.\r\n\r\nA Phocian is the most probable explanation of the name of Φοκας\r\n(Phocas), though much older in Greece than the date of most of those\r\nthat have been here given. To us it is associated with the monster who\r\nusurped the imperial throne, and murdered Maurice and his sons; but it\r\nhad previously belonged to a martyred gardener, under Diocletian, whose\r\nresidence in Pontus made him well known to the Byzantine Church; and\r\nthus Phokas is still found among Greeks, and Foka in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Romans called their enemies in North Africa Mauri, from the Greek\r\nἀμαυρός, which at first was twilight or dim, but came afterwards to\r\nsignify dark, or black.\r\n\r\nMaura was a Gallican maiden of the ninth century, whose name, it would\r\nseem highly probable, might have been the Keltic Mohr (great), still\r\ncurrent in Ireland and the Highlands. She led a life of great\r\nmortification, died at twenty-three, was canonized, and becoming known\r\nto the Venetians, a church in her honour named the Ionian island of\r\nSanta Maura, which had formerly been Leucadia. There was, however, a\r\ngenuine Greek St. Maura, the wife of Timothy, a priest, with whom she\r\nwas crucified in the Thebaid, under Maximian. She is honoured by the\r\nEastern Church on the 3rd of May, and is the subject of a poem of Mr.\r\nKingsley’s. From her, many Greek girls bear the name of Maura, and\r\nRussian ones of Mavra and Mavruscha.\r\n\r\nMauritius was naturally a term with the Romans for a man of Moorish\r\nlineage. The first saint of this name was the Tribune of the Theban\r\nlegion, all Christians, who perished to a man under the blows of their\r\nfellow-soldiers, near the foot of the great St. Bernard. To this brave\r\nman is due the great frequency of Maurits, in Switzerland, passing into\r\nMaurizio on the Italian border, and Moritz on the German. The old French\r\nwas Meurisse, the old English, Morris; but both, though still extant as\r\nsurnames, have as Christian names been assimilated to the Latin\r\nspelling, and become Maurice. The frequent Irish Morris, and the once\r\ncommon Scottish Morris, are the imitation of the Gaelic Moriertagh, or\r\nsea warrior.\r\n\r\nMeuriz is in use in Wales, and appears to be the genuine produce of\r\nMaurice; but it is very difficult to disentangle the derivations from\r\nthe Moor, from ἀμαυρός, and from the Keltic _mohr_ (large) and _mör_\r\n(the sea).\r\n\r\nThe Saxon Moritz, who played a double game between Charles V. and the\r\nProtestant League, was brother-in-law to the great William the Silent,\r\nand thus his name was transmitted to his nephew, the gallant champion of\r\nthe United Provinces, Maurice of Nassau, in whose honour the Dutch\r\nbestowed the name of Mauritius upon their island settlement in the\r\nIndian Ocean, and this title has finally gained the victory over the\r\nnative one of Cerine, and the French one of the Isle of Bourbon.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Welsh.     │    Breton.    │    French.    │\r\n   │Morris         │Meuriz         │Noris          │Meurisse       │\r\n   │Maurice        │               │               │Maurice        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │     Italian.  │   Spanish.    │    German.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Maurizio       │Mauricio       │Moritz         │Maurids        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Morets         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Moriz          │Maurycij       │Moric          │Moricz         │\r\n   │Mavrizij       │               │               │               │\r\n   │Mavritij       │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nGermanus cannot be reckoned otherwise than as one of the varieties of\r\nnames from countries given by the Romans. It does indeed come from the\r\ntwo Teutonic words _gher_ (spear) and _mann_; but it cannot be classed\r\namong the names compounded of _gher_, since the Romans were far from\r\nthus understanding it, when, like Mauritius, it must have been inherited\r\nby some ‘young barbarian’ whose father served in the Roman legions.\r\n\r\nSt. Germanus was greatly distinguished in Kelto-Roman Church history, as\r\nhaving refuted Pelagius, and won the Hallelujah victory, to say nothing\r\nof certain unsatisfactory miracles. We have various places named after\r\nhim, but it was the French who chiefly kept up his name, and gave it the\r\nfeminine Germaine, which was borne by that lady of the family of Foix,\r\nwho became the second wife of Fernando the Catholic by the name of\r\nGermana. Jermyn has at times been used in England, and became a\r\nsurname.[86]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  Cave; Butler; _Revue des deux Mondes_; Le Beau, _Bas Empire_; Liddell\r\n  and Scott; Lower; _Les Vies des Saints_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION XIX.—_Town and Country._\r\n\r\nUrbanus is one who dwells in _urbs_ (a city), a person whose courtesy\r\nand statesmanship are assumed, as is shown by the words civil, from\r\n_civis_ (a city), and polite, politic, polish, from the Greek πὸλις of\r\nthe same meaning; and thus Urbane conveys something of grace and\r\naffability in contrast to rustic rudeness.\r\n\r\nUrbanus is greeted by St. Paul; and another Urbanus was an early pope,\r\nfrom whom it travelled into other tongues as Urbano, Urbani, and Urban.\r\n\r\n  ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐\r\n  │ English. │ French.  │  Roman.  │ Russian. │ Slovak.  │Hungarian.│\r\n  │Urban     │Urbain    │Urbano    │Urvan     │Verban    │Orban     │\r\n  │          │          │          │          │Banej     │          │\r\n  └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this word comes that for the rustic, _Pagus_,\r\nsignifying the country; the word that in Italian becomes _paese_, in\r\nSpanish _pais_, in French _pays_. The Gospel was first preached in the\r\nbusy haunts of men, so that the earlier Christians were towns-folk, and\r\nthe rustics long continued heathen; whence Paganus, once simply a\r\ncountryman, became an idolater, a Pagan, and poetized into Paynim, was\r\nabsolutely bestowed upon the Turks and Saracens in the middle ages. In\r\nthe mean time, however, the rustic had come to be called _paesano_,\r\n_pays_, _paysan_, and _peasant_, independently of his religion; and\r\nSpain, in addition to her _payo_ (the countryman), had _paisano_ (the\r\nlover of his country); and either in the sense of habitation or\r\npatriotism, Pagano was erected into a Christian name in Italy, and Payen\r\nin France; whence England took Payne or Pain, still one of the most\r\nfrequent surnames.\r\n\r\nThe two Latin words, _per_ (through) and _ager_ (a field), were the\r\nsource of _peregrinus_ (a traveller or wanderer), also the inhabitant of\r\nthe country as opposed to the Roman colonist. The same word in time came\r\nto mean both a stranger, and above all, one on a journey to a holy\r\nplace, when such pilgrimages had become special acts of devotion, and\r\nwere growing into living allegories of the Christian life. This became a\r\nChristian name in Italy, because a hermit, said to have been a prince of\r\nIrish blood, settled himself in a lonely hut on one of the Apennines,\r\nnear Modena, and was known there as _il pellegrin_, as the Latin word\r\nhad become softened. He died in 643, and was canonized as St.\r\nPeregrinus, or San Pellegrino; became one of the patrons of Modena and\r\nLucca, and had all the neighbouring spur of the Apennines called after\r\nhim. Pellegrino Pelligrini is a name that we find occurring in Italian\r\nhistory; and when a son was born at Wesel, to Sir Richard Bertie and his\r\nwife, the Duchess of Suffolk, while they were fleeing from Queen Mary’s\r\npersecution, they named him Peregrine, “for that he was given by the\r\nLord to his pious parents in a strange land for the consolation of their\r\nexile,” as says his baptismal register, and Peregrine in consequence\r\ncame into favour in the Bertie family; but in an old register the names\r\nPhilgram, Pilgerlam, and Pilggerlam, occur about 1603.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Peregrine      │Pérégrin       │Pellegrino     │Piligrim       │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nTo these may perhaps be added the Italian Marino and Marina, given\r\nperhaps casually to sea-side dwellers; and their Greek equivalents,\r\nPelagios and Pelagia, both of which are still used by the modern Greeks.\r\nPelagius was used by the Irish, or more properly Scottish, Morgan, as a\r\ntranslation of his own name, and thus became tainted with the connection\r\nof the Pelagian heresy; but it did not become extinct; and Pelayo was\r\nthe Spanish prince who first began the brave resistance that rendered\r\nthe mountains of the Asturias a nucleus for the new kingdom of Spain.\r\n\r\nSome see in his name a sign that the Arian opinions of the Visigoths had\r\nsome hereditary influence, at least, in nomenclature; and, indeed, Ario\r\noccurs long after as a Christian name; others consider Pelago’s\r\nclassical name to be a sign that the old Celto-Roman blood was coming to\r\nthe surface above the Gothic.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland likewise has this name cut down to Pelei, or Poli.[87]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  Butler; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION XX.—_Flower Names._\r\n\r\nFlower names seem to have been entirely unknown to the ancient Romans,\r\nbut the Latin language, in the mouths of more poetical races, has given\r\nseveral graceful floral names, though none perhaps are quite free from\r\nthe imputation of being originally something far less elegant.\r\n\r\nThus, _oliva_ (the olive), the sign of peace and joy, is closely\r\nconnected with the Italian Oliviero; but it is much to be suspected that\r\nit would never have blossomed into use, but for the Teutonic Olaf\r\n(forefather’s relic). Oliviero, or Ulivieri, the paladin of Charlemagne,\r\nmay be considered as almost certainly a transmogrified Anlaf, or Olaf\r\n(ancestor’s relic); and perhaps it is for this reason that his name is\r\none of the most frequently in use among all those of the circle of\r\npaladins. He was a favourite hero of Pulci, and seems to have so nearly\r\napproached Orlando in fame, as at least to be worthy of figuring in the\r\nproverb of giving a Rowland for an Oliver. The middle ages made great\r\nuse of his name in France and England. Olier, as it was called at home\r\nby the Breton knights, whom the French called Olivier, was the name of\r\nthe favourite brother of Du Guesclin, as well as of the terrible\r\nConstable de Clisson. Oliver was frequent with English knights, and of\r\nhigh and chivalrous repute, until the eminence of the Protector rendered\r\n‘old Noll’ a word of hate and would-be scorn to the Cavaliers—an\r\nassociation which it has never entirely overcome. The feminine was\r\nprobably first invented in Italy, but the Italian literature that flowed\r\nin on us in the Tudor reigns brought it to us, and we were wise enough\r\nto naturalize Olivia as Olive, a form that still survives in some parts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nWhether it is true that the “rose by any other name would smell as\r\nsweet,” never appears to have been tried, for all countries seem to\r\nexpress both the flower and its blushing tint by the same sound; and\r\neven the Syriac name for the oleander (the rose-laurel), “the blossoms\r\nred and bright” of the Lake of Tiberias, is _rodyon_.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had their Rhoda, but the Romans never attained such a flight\r\nof poetry as a floral name, and the rose-wreath would hardly deserve to\r\nbe relegated to a Latin root, were it not that the branches spread so\r\nwidely, that it is more convenient to start from this common stem, to\r\nwhich all are bound by mutual resemblance; besides which, both the\r\nsaints of this name were of Romance nations. Still, I believe, that\r\nthough _their_ names were meant for roses when given to them, that the\r\nfirst use of _hrôs_ among the Teutons was a meaning sometimes fame,\r\nsometimes a horse—not the flower.\r\n\r\nRohais, or Roesia, most probably the French and Latin of _hrôs_ (fame),\r\nor else from _hros_ (horse), is the first form in which the simple word\r\nappears in England. Rohais, wife of Gilbert de Gaunt, died in 1156;\r\nRoese de Lucy was wife of Fulbert de Dover, in the time of Henry II.;\r\nRoesia was found at the same time among the De Bohuns and De Veres; and\r\nsome of these old Norman families must have carried it to Ireland, where\r\nRose is one of the most common of the peasant names. Rosel and Rosette\r\nboth occur at Cambrai between 900 and 1200.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelfth century, probably among the Normans of Sicily, lived\r\nRosalia, “the darling of each heart and eye,” who, in her youth,\r\ndedicated herself to a hermit life in a mountain grotto, and won a\r\nsaintly reputation for her name, which is frequent in her island, as is\r\nRosalie in France, and at the German town of Duderstadt, where it is\r\nvilely tortured into Sahlke.\r\n\r\nSt. Dominic arranged a series of devotions, consisting of the\r\nmeditations, while rehearsing the recurring _aves_ and _paters_ marked\r\nby the larger and smaller nuts, or berries, on a string. These, which we\r\ncall beads from _beden_ (to pray), formed the _rosarium_, or rose\r\ngarden, meaning originally the delights of devotion. This _rosarium_ has\r\na day to itself in the Roman calendar, and possibly may have named the\r\nTransatlantic saint, Rosa di Lima, the whole of which appellation is\r\nborne by Peruvian señoras, and practically called Rosita.\r\n\r\nRosa is found in all kinds of ornamental forms in different countries,\r\nand the contractions, or diminutives, of one become the names of\r\nanother. Thus Rosalia, herself, probably sprang from the endearment\r\nRosel, which together with Rosi is common in Switzerland and the Tyrol;\r\nthe German diminutive Roschen is met again in the Italian Rosina, French\r\nRosine, English Rosanne; the Rasine, or Rasche, of Lithuania; and\r\nRosetta, the true Italian diminutive, is followed by the French Rosette.\r\n\r\nThese may be considered as the true and natural forms of Rose. Others\r\nwere added by fancy and romance after the Teuton signification of fame\r\nhad been forgotten, and the Latin one of the flower adopted.\r\n\r\nOf these, are Rosaura, Rosaclara; in English, Roseclear, Rosalba (a\r\nwhite rose), Rosabella, or Rosabel, all arrant fancy names.\r\n\r\nRosamond has a far more ancient history, but the rose connection must be\r\nentirely renounced for her. The first Hrosmond (famous protection, or\r\nhorse protection) was the fierce chieftainess of the Gepidæ, who was\r\ncompelled by her Lombard husband to drink to his health in a ghastly\r\ngoblet formed of the skull of her slaughtered father, and who avenged\r\nthis crowning insult by a midnight murder.\r\n\r\nEven from the fifth century, the period of this tragedy, hers has\r\nremained a favourite name among the peasantry of the Jura, the land of\r\nthe Gepidæ, but it does not appear how it came from them to the Norman\r\nCliffords, by whom it was bestowed upon Fair Rosamond, whose fate has\r\nbeen so strangely altered by ballad lore, and still more strangely by\r\nCervantes, who makes his Persiles and Sigismunda encounter her in the\r\nArctic regions, undergoing a dreary penance among the wehr wolves. Her\r\nname, in its supposed interpretation, gave rise to the Latin epigram,\r\n_Rosa mundi, sed non Rosa munda_ (the rose of the world, but not a pure\r\nrose). The sound of the word, and the popular interest of the ballad,\r\nhave continued her name in England.\r\n\r\nHroswith, the poetical Frank nun, is certainly famous strength, or\r\nfamous height, though when softened into Roswitha, she has been taken\r\nfor a white rose, or a sweet rose.\r\n\r\nRosalind makes her first appearance in _As You Like It_, whether\r\ninvented by Shakespeare cannot be guessed. If the word be really old,\r\nthe first syllable is certainly _hrôs_, the last is our English _lithe_,\r\nthe German _lind_, the Northern _lindre_, the term that has caused the\r\nGermans to call the snake the _lindwurm_, or supple worm. The Visigoths\r\nconsidered this litheness as beauty, and thus the word survives in\r\nSpanish as _lindo_, _linda_, meaning, indeed, a fair woman, but a soft\r\neffeminate man. Yet, the _linda_, meaning fair in Spanish, was reason\r\nenough in the sixteenth century for attaching it to many a name by way\r\nof ornament, and it is to be apprehended that thus it was that Rosalind\r\ncame by her name, and possibly Rosaline, whom Romeo deserted for the\r\nsake of Juliet. However she began, she has ever since been one of the\r\nEnglish roses.\r\n\r\nRosilde, or Roshilda, a German form, is in like manner either really the\r\nfame-battle, or else merely _ilda_ tacked by way of ornament to the end\r\nof the rose.\r\n\r\nViolante is a name occurring in the South of France and the North of\r\nItaly and Spain. Whence it originally came is almost impossible to\r\ndiscover. It may very probably be a corruption of some old Latin name\r\nsuch as Valentinus, or, which would be a prettier derivation, it may be\r\nfrom the golden violet, the prize of the troubadours in the courts of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nThe name of the flower is universal; it is _viola_, in Latin, _vas_ in\r\nSanscrit; and in Greek anciently Γιον, but afterwards ἴον, whence later\r\nGreeks supposed it to have been named from having formed a garland round\r\nthe head of Ion, the father of the Ionians.\r\n\r\nThat _V_ is easily changed to _Y_, was plain in the treatment received\r\nby Violante, who was left to that dignified sound only in Spain; but in\r\nFrance was called Yolande, or for affection, Yolette; and in the\r\nconfusion between _y_ and _j_, figures in our own English histories in\r\nthe queer-looking form of Joletta. The Scots, with much better taste,\r\nimported Yolette as Violet, learning it probably through the connections\r\nof the Archers of the Royal Guard, or it may be through Queen Mary’s\r\nfriends, as Violet Forbes appears in 1571, and I have not found an\r\nearlier instance. At any rate, the Scottish love of floral names took\r\nhold of it, and the Violets have flourished there ever since. Fialka is\r\nboth the flower and a family name in Bohemia; as is Veigel in the\r\nViennese dialect. Eva Maria Veigel was the young _danseuse_, called by\r\nMaria Theresa, la Violetta, under which designation she came to England,\r\nand finally became the excellent wife of Garrick. Whether Viola has ever\r\nbeen a real Italian name I cannot learn, or whether it is only part of\r\nthe stage property endeared to us by Shakespeare. The masculine Yoland\r\nwas common at Cambrai in the thirteenth century; Yolante was there used\r\ndown to the sixteenth.\r\n\r\nViridis (green, or flourishing) was not uncommon among Italian ladies in\r\nthe fourteenth century, probably in allusion to some romance.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be feared that the lily, is as little traceable as the\r\nrose. There was a Liliola Gonzaga in Italy in 1340, but she was probably\r\na softened Ziliola, or Cecilia. Lilias Ruthven, who occurs in Scotland,\r\nin 1557, was probably called from the old romantic poem of _Roswal and\r\nLillian_, which for many years was a great favourite in Scotland. The\r\nLillian of this ballad is Queen of Naples, and thus the name appears\r\nclearly traceable to the Cecilias of modern Italy, though it is now\r\nusually given in the _sense_ of Lily; the English using Lillian; the\r\nScots, Lillias. Indeed, it is quite possible that these, like Lilla, may\r\nsometimes have risen out of contractions of Elizabeth. Leila is a\r\nMoorish name, and Lelia is only the feminine of Lælius. On the whole, it\r\nmay be said that only the Hebrew and Slavonic tongues present us with\r\nnames _really_ taken from individual flowers.[88]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  Michaelis; Munch; Pott; Roscoe, _Boiardo_; Anderson, _Genealogies_;\r\n  Douglas, _Peerage of Scotland_; Ellis, _Specimens of Early English\r\n  Poetry_; Butler, _Cervantes_; Sismondi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION XXI.—_Roman Catholic Names._\r\n\r\nThe two names that follow are as thorough evidences of the teachings of\r\nthe Roman Church as are the epithets of the Blessed Virgin, before\r\nmentioned, and can, therefore, only be classed together, though it is\r\nrather hard upon good Latin to be saddled with them, compounded as they\r\nare of Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\nThe Latin _verus_ (true), and the Greek εἰκών (an image), were strangely\r\njumbled together by the popular tongue in the name of a crucifix at\r\nLucca, which was called the _Veraiconica_, or Veronica; and was that\r\nHoly Face of Lucca by which William Rufus, having probably heard of it\r\nfrom the Lombard Lanfranc, his tutor, was wont to swear. Another\r\nVeronica is the same countenance upon a piece of linen, shown at St.\r\nPeter’s. Superstition, forgetting the meaning of the name, called the\r\nrelic St. Veronica’s handkerchief, accounted for it by inventing a woman\r\nwho had lent our Blessed Saviour a handkerchief to wipe His Face during\r\nthe passage of the _Via dolorosa_, and had found the likeness imprinted\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nIn an old English poem on the life of Pilate, written before 1305, it\r\nappears that the Emperor of Rome learnt that a woman at Jerusalem named\r\n‘Veronike’ possessed this handkerchief, which could heal him of his\r\nsickness. He sent for her, and\r\n\r\n       “Anon tho the ymage iseth, he was whole, anon,\r\n       He honoured wel Veronike, heo ne moste fram him gon;\r\n       The ymage he athuld that hit ne com nevereft out of Rome,\r\n       In Seint Peteres Church it is.”\r\n\r\nThence Veronica became a patron saint; and in the fifteenth century a\r\nreal monastic Saint Veronica lived near Milan.\r\n\r\nVéronique is rather a favourite name among French peasant women, and\r\nVreneli in Suabia. Pott and Michaelis suggest that Veronica may be the\r\nLatin form of Berenice, or Pherenike (victory-bringer); but the history\r\nof the relic is too clear to admit of this idea. The flower, Veronica,\r\nappears to have won its name from its exquisite blue reflecting a true\r\nimage of the heavens; and the Scots, who have a peculiar turn for floral\r\nnames, thus seem to have obtained it.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 an inscription, with the first and last letters destroyed, was\r\nfound in the catacombs standing thus, _lumena pax tecum fi_. A priest\r\nsuggested that _Fi_ should be put at the beginning of the sentence\r\ninstead of the end, and by this remarkable trick, produced _Filumena_.\r\nThere was a real Greek name Philomena, which had fallen into disuse, and\r\nof course was derived from Love, but to please the ears of the Italians,\r\nthe barbarous Latin Filumen was invented.\r\n\r\nThereupon a devout artisan, a priest, and a nun, were all severally\r\nfavoured by visions of a virgin martyr, who told them the story of\r\nDiocletian’s love for her, of her refusal, and subsequent martyrdom; and\r\nexplained that, having once been called Lumena, she was baptized\r\nFilumena, which she explained as daughter of light! Some, human remains\r\nnear the stone being dignified as relics of St. Filomena, she was\r\npresented to Mugnano; and, on the way, not only worked many miracles on\r\nher adorers, but actually repaired her own skeleton, and made her hair\r\ngrow. So many wonders are said to have been worked by this phantom\r\nsaint, the mere produce of a blundered inscription, that a book, printed\r\nat Paris in the year 1847, calls her “_La Thaumaturge du 19me Siècle_”\r\nand she is by far the most fashionable patroness in the Romish Church.\r\nFilomena abounds in Rome, encouraged by the example of a little\r\nFilomena, whose mosquito net was every night removed by the saint, who\r\nherself kept off the gnats. She is making her way in Spain; and it will\r\nnot be the fault of the author of _La Thaumaturge_ if Philomene is not\r\ncommon in France. The likeness to Philomela farther inspired Longfellow\r\nwith the fancy of writing a poem on Florence Nightingale, as St.\r\nPhilomena, whence it is possible that the antiquaries of New Zealand, in\r\nthe twenty-ninth century, will imagine St. Philomena, or Philomela, to\r\nbe the heroine of the Crimean war.[89]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Butler; _Philological Society_; Merriman, _Church in Spain_; _La\r\n  Thaumaturge du 19me Siècle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                         NAMES FROM HOLY DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I.\r\n\r\nThe great festivals of religion have supplied names which are here\r\nclassed together for convenience of arrangement, though they are of all\r\nlanguages. Most, indeed, are taken from the tongue that first proclaimed\r\nthe glory of the days in question; but in several instances they have\r\nbeen translated into the vernacular of the country celebrating them.\r\nPerhaps the use of most of these as Christian names arose from the habit\r\nof calling children after the patron of their birthday, and when this\r\nfell upon a holiday that was not a saint’s day, transferring the title\r\nof the day to the child. Indeed, among the French peasantry, Marcel and\r\nMarcelle are given to persons born in March, Jules and Julie to July\r\nchildren, and Auguste and Augustine to August children.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION II.—_Christmas._\r\n\r\nThe birthday of our Lord bears in general its Latin title of _Dies\r\nNatalis_; the latter word from _nascor_ (to be born). The _g_, which old\r\nLatin places at the commencement of the verb and its participle,\r\n_gnatus_, shows its connection with the Greek γίγνομαι (to come into\r\nexistence), with γένεσις (origin), and the Anglo-Saxon _beginning_.\r\n\r\nThis word Natalis has furnished the title of the feast to all the\r\nRomance portion of Europe, and to Wales. There all call it the Natal\r\nday; _Nadolig_ in Welsh. France has cut the word down into Noël, a word\r\nthat at Angers was sung fifteen times at the conclusion of lauds, during\r\nthe eight days before the feast, and which thus passed even into an\r\nEnglish carol, still sung in Cornwall, where the popular tongue has\r\nturned the chorus into\r\n\r\n                    “Now well! now well! now well!”\r\n\r\nThis cry of Noël became a mere burst of joy; and in Monstrelet’s time\r\nwas shouted quite independently of Christmas. Noel is a Christian name\r\nin France; Natale, in Italy; Natal, in the Peninsula. Indeed, the\r\nPortuguese called Port Natal by that title in honour of the time of its\r\ndiscovery, but the Spanish Natal must be distinguished from Natividad,\r\nwhich belongs to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, a feast established\r\nby Pope Sergius in 688, on the 8th of September.\r\n\r\nThat same 8th of September was chosen by the Greek Church as the\r\nfestival day of St. Natalia, the devoted wife who attended her husband,\r\nSt. Adrian, in his martyrdom, with heroism like that of Gertrude von der\r\nWart. He is the same Adrian whose relics filled the Netherlands, and who\r\nnamed so many Dutchmen; but while the West was devoted to the husband\r\nand neglected the wife, the East celebrated the wife and forgot the\r\nhusband. Natalia is one of the favourite Greek Christian names;\r\nLithuania calls her Nastusche and Naste; Russia, Natalija, Nataschenka,\r\nand Natascha; and France has learned the word as Natalie from her\r\nRussian visitors. Natalie, however, occurs at Cambrai as early as 1212.\r\n\r\nOur own name for the feast agrees with one German provincial term\r\nChristfest. Christmas now and then occurs in old registers as a\r\nChristian name, as at Froxfield, Hants, in 1574, and is also used as a\r\nsurname; but Noel is more usual for Christmas-born children.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Church did not originally observe the Nativity at all,\r\ncontenting itself with the day when the great birth was manifested to\r\nthe Gentiles, and for this reason there is no genuine Greek name for\r\nChristmas-day, and Natalia, though now used as a Greek woman’s name, is\r\nof Latin origin.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonic nations have translated Christmas into Bozieni, and their\r\nChristmas children, among the Slovak part of the race, are the boys,\r\nBozo, Bozko, Bozicko; the girls, Bozena.[90]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  _Church Festivals and their Household Words (Christian Remembrancer)_;\r\n  Michaelis; Butler; Jameson; Grimm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION III.—_The Epiphany._\r\n\r\nThe twelfth day after Christmas was the great day with the Eastern\r\nChurch, by whom it was called Θεοφανεία, from Θεός and φαίνω (to make\r\nknown, _i.e._, God’s manifestation), or Ἐπιφάνεια (forth showing).\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek Church celebrated on the 6th of January the birth of\r\nChrist, His manifestation to the Gentiles, and the baptism in the\r\nJordan. Their titles, Theophania and Epiphania, were adopted by the\r\nLatins, and when the Latin feast of the Nativity was accepted by the\r\nGreek Church, _this_ latter was frequently called Epiphania, while the\r\ntrue manifestation-day was called by a name meaning the lights, from the\r\nmultitude of candles in the churches in honour of the Light of the World\r\nand the Light of Baptism.\r\n\r\nBut in the West, it was the visit of the Magi that gave the strongest\r\nimpress to the festival. Early did tradition fix their number at three,\r\nprobably in allusion to the three races of man descended from the sons\r\nof Noah, and soon they were said to be descendants of the Mesopotamian\r\nprophet Balaam, from whom they derived the expectation of the Star of\r\nJacob, and they were promoted to be kings of Tarsus, Saba, and Nubia,\r\nalso to have been baptized by St. Thomas, and afterwards martyred. Their\r\ncorpses were supposed to be at that store-house of relics,\r\nConstantinople, whence the Empress Helena caused them to be transported\r\nto Milan by an Italian, from whom a noble family at Florence obtained\r\nthe surname of Epiphania. Frederick Barbarossa carried them to Cologne.\r\n\r\nBy the eleventh century, these three kings had received names, for they\r\nare found written over against their figures in a painting of that date,\r\nand occur in the breviary of Mersburg. Though their original donor is\r\nunknown, their Oriental sound makes it probable that he was a\r\npilgrim-gatherer of Eastern legends. Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar,\r\nare not according to European fancy, and are not easy to explain. The\r\nfirst may either be the Persian, _gendshber_ (treasure master), or else\r\nbe taken from the red or green stone called _yashpah_ in the East,\r\nἵασπις in Greek, _jasper_ in Latin. This was the only one of these names\r\never used in England, where it was once common. Gasparde is the French\r\nfeminine; in English the masculine is Jasper. It is extremely common in\r\nGermany; and has suffered the penalty of popularity, for Black Kaspar is\r\na name of the devil, and Kaspar is a Jack Pudding.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Jasper         │Gaspard        │Gaspar         │Gaspare        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gaspardo       │\r\n   │               │               │               │Casparo        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │   Illyrian.   │     Lett.     │\r\n   │Kaspar         │Kaspe          │Gaso           │Kaspers        │\r\n   │    ———————    │Kasperl        │    ———————    │Jespers        │\r\n   │   Frisjan.    │Gaspe          │   Lusatian.   │               │\r\n   │Jaspar         │Gappe          │Kaspor         │               │\r\n   │               │Kapp           │Kapo           │               │\r\n   │               │Kass           │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nMelchior is evidently the universal Eastern Malek, or Melchi (a king);\r\nbut he is in much less favour than his companion; though sometimes found\r\nin Italy as Melchiorre, as well as in Germany and Switzerland in his\r\nproper form, and in Esthonia contracted to Malk.\r\n\r\nBalthasar may be an imitation of Daniel’s Chaldean name of Belteshazzar\r\n(Bel’s prince).

Besides, when the carnival was\r\nover, there was a sudden immolation of the remaining weeks of the\r\nEpiphany; and whether from thus personifying the season, or from\r\nwhatever other cause, a figure was suspended outside the doors of houses\r\nat the beginning of Lent, and called la Beffana. It is now a frightful\r\nblack doll, with an orange at her feet, and seven skewers thrust through\r\nher, one of which is pulled out at the end of each week in Lent; at\r\nleast, this is the case in Apulia, where she is considered as a token\r\nthat those who exhibit her, mean to observe a rigorous fast.\r\n\r\nSome parts of Italy account for the gibbeting of the unfortunate\r\nBeffana, by saying she was the daughter of Herod, _i.e._ Herodias; and\r\nBerni (as quoted by Grimm) says in his rhymes:\r\n\r\n           “Il di Befania, vo porla per Befana alla finestra,\r\n           Perchè qualcun le dia d’una ballestra.”\r\n\r\nAt Florence, however, the story was told in an entirely different way.\r\nThere it is said that Beffana was the Christian name of a damsel of the\r\nEpifania family before-mentioned: that she offended the fairies, and was\r\nby them tempted to eat a sausage in Lent, for which transgression she\r\nwas sawn asunder in the piazza, and has ever since been hung in effigy\r\nat the end of the carnival, as a warning to all beholders.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Beffana is the Italian bugbear of naughty children; and it is\r\nno wonder that this strange embodiment of the gift-bringing day should\r\nnot be followed as a Christian name, though the masculine form,\r\nEpiphanius, once belonged to a Father, born near Mount Olympus, in whose\r\nhonour is named Capa Pifani, a headland on that coast, and from whom\r\nEpifanio sometimes is found at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe other form of the name of the day, Theophania, has been much more in\r\nfavour; indeed, in the days of Christine de Pisane, the feast-day was\r\ncalled la Tiphaïne.\r\n\r\nTheophano was a name in common use among the Byzantine ladies, and we\r\nhear of many princesses so called—one of whom married the German\r\nEmperor, Otho II., in 962, and was then called Théophania. Probably she\r\nmade the name known in Western Europe, but it is curious that its chief\r\nhome in the form of Tiphaïne, was in Armorica, whence, as the grumbling\r\nrhyme of the Englishman, after the Conquest, declared,\r\n\r\n                        “William de Coningsby,\r\n                        Came out of Brittany,\r\n                        With his wife Tiffany,\r\n                        And his maid Manfas,\r\n                        And his dog Hardigras.”\r\n\r\nTiffany took up her abode in England, and left her progeny. The name\r\noccurs in an old Devon register, within the last two hundred years, but\r\nseems now extinct.\r\n\r\nThe high-spirited wife of Bertrand du Guesclin, was either Theophanie,\r\nor Epiphanie Ragueuel, but was commonly called Tiphaïne la Fée, on\r\naccount of the mysterious wisdom by which she was able to predict to her\r\nhusband his lucky and unlucky days—only he never studied her tablets\r\ntill the disaster had happened. Could she have first acquired her\r\ncurious title through some report of her namesake, the Fairy Beffana? In\r\na Cornish register I find Epiphany in 1672; Tiffany in 1682.\r\n\r\nIn an old German dictionary, the feast Theophania is translated\r\n“Giperahta naht” (the brightened night), a curious accordance with its\r\nGreek title. Indeed, before the relic-worship of the Three Kings of\r\nCologne had stifled the recollection of the real signification of the\r\nday of the Manifestation, the festival was commonly termed Perchten tac,\r\nPerchten naht (bright day, or bright night). Then went on in Germany\r\nmuch what had befallen Beffana in Italy. By the analogy of saints' days,\r\nPerahta, or Bertha, was erected into an individual character, called in\r\nan Alsatian poem, the mild Berchte; in whose honour all the young\r\nfarming men in the Salzburg mountains go dancing about, ringing cattle\r\nbells, and blowing whistles all night. Sometimes she is a gentle white\r\nlady, who steals softly to neglected cradles, and rocks them in the\r\nabsence of careless nurses; but she is also the terror of naughty\r\nchildren, who are threatened with Frau Precht with the long nose; and\r\nshe is likewise the avenger of the idle spinners, working woe to those\r\nwho have not spun off their hank on the last day of the year. Can this\r\nhave anything to do with distaff day—the English name for the 7th of\r\nJanuary, when work was resumed after the holidays? Herrings and\r\noat-bread are put outside the door for her on her festival—a token of\r\nits Christian origin; but there is something of heathenism connected\r\nwith her, for if the bread and fish are not duly put out for her,\r\nterrible vengeance is inflicted, with a plough-share, or an iron chain.\r\n\r\nThat Frau Bertha is an impersonation of the Epiphany there seems little\r\ndoubt, but it appears that there was an original mythical Bertha, who\r\nabsorbed the brightened night, or if the bright night gave a new title\r\nto the old mythical Holda, Holla, Hulla, Huldr (the faithful, or the\r\nmuffled), a white spinning lady, who is making her feather-bed when it\r\nsnows. She, too, brings presents at the year’s end; rewards good\r\nspinners, punishes idle ones, has a long nose, wears a blue gown and\r\nwhite veil, and drives through the fields in a car with golden wheels.\r\nScandinavia calls her Hulla, or Huldr the propitious; Northern Germany,\r\nHolda, probably by adaptation to _hold_ (mild). Franconia and Thuringia\r\nrecognized both Holda and Berchta; in Alsatia, Swabia, Switzerland,\r\nBavaria, and Austria, Berchta alone prevails.\r\n\r\nSome have even tried to identify Holda with Huldah, the prophetess, in\r\nthe Old Testament, but this is manifestly a blunder. And, on the other\r\nhand, Bertha is supposed to be a name of the goddess Freya, the wife of\r\nOdin; but it appears that though Huldr may possibly have been originally\r\na beneficent form of this goddess, yet that there is no evidence of\r\nBertha’s prevailing in heathen times, and therefore the most probable\r\nconclusion is that she is really the impersonation of the Epiphany, with\r\nthe attributes of Holda.\r\n\r\nTradition made her into an ancestress, and she must have absorbed some\r\nof the legends of the swan maidens, for she is goose-footed in some of\r\nher legends; and she is sometimes, as in Franconia and Swabia, called\r\nHildaberta or Bildaberta, either from the Valkyr, or as a union of both\r\nHilda and Bertha. The goose-foot has been almost softened away by the\r\ntime she appears as _Berthe aux grands pieds_ (wife of Pepin, and mother\r\nof Charlemagne); and the connection with the distaff is again traceable\r\nin the story of Charlemagne’s sister Bertha, mother of Orlando, who,\r\nwhen cast off on account of her marriage, and left a widow, maintained\r\nherself by spinning, till her son, in his parti-coloured raiment, won\r\nhis uncle’s notice by his bold demeanour.\r\n\r\nProverbs of a golden age when Bertha spun, are current both in France\r\nand Italy, and in Switzerland they are connected with the real Queen\r\nBertha.\r\n\r\nBe it observed that Bertha is altogether a Frank notion, not prevailing\r\namong the Saxons, either English or Continental, nor among the Northern\r\nraces. It is therefore quite a mistake to use Bertha, as is often done,\r\nas a name for an English lady, before the Conquest. One only historical\r\nperson so called was Bertha, daughter of Chilperic, King of Paris, and\r\nwife of Ethelbert, of Kent, the same who smoothed the way for St.\r\nAugustine’s mission. She was probably called after the imaginary\r\nspinning ancestress, the visitor of Christmas night, but though bright\r\nwas a common Saxon commencement or conclusion, we had no more Berthas\r\ntill the Norman conquest brought an influx of Frank names.\r\n\r\nThe name was, indeed, very common in France and Germany; and in Dante’s\r\ntime it was so frequent at Florence, that he places Monna Berta with Ser\r\nMartino, as the chief of the gossips. Since those days it has died away,\r\nbut has been revived of late years in the taste for old names; and\r\nperhaps, likewise, because Southey mentioned it as one of the most\r\neuphonious of female appellations. One of the early German princesses,\r\ncalled Bertha, marrying a Greek emperor, was translated into Eudoxia,\r\nlittle thinking that she ought to have been Theophano.[91]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  _Church Festivals and Household Words_; Maury-Essaisin; _Les Légendes\r\n  Picuses du Moyen Age_; _Die Stern du Weisen_; Routh; _Reliquia Sacra_;\r\n  Grimm; Brand; Stanhope, _Belisarius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION IV.—_Easter Names._\r\n\r\nThe next day of the Christian year that has given a name is that which\r\nwe emphatically call Good Friday, but which the Eastern Church knows by\r\nthe title that it bears in the New Testament, the Day of Preparation,\r\nΠαρασκευή (Paraskewe), from πάρα (beyond), and σκεύη (gear or\r\nimplements). Thence, a daughter born on that holy day, was christened\r\namong the Russians Paraskeva; and the name that has been corrupted by\r\nthe French into Prascovie, and which is called for short Pascha, is very\r\nfrequent in the great empire, and belonged to the brave maiden,\r\nParaskeva Loupouloff, whose devotion to her parents suggested Madame\r\nCottin’s tale of _Elizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia_, where the\r\nadventures, as well as the name, are deprived of their national\r\nindividuality in the fashion of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe Passover was known from the first to the Israelites as Pasach, or\r\nPesach, a word exactly rendered by our Passover, and which has furnished\r\nthe Jews with a name not occurring in the Scripture—Pesachiah, the\r\nPassover of God.\r\n\r\nThe Greek translators represented the word by Πάσχα. It is Pascha\r\nlikewise in Latin; whence all modern languages have at least taken some\r\nof their terms for the great feast of the Resurrection that finally\r\ncrowned and explained the Jewish Passover.\r\n\r\nItaly inherits Pasqua; Spain, Pascua; Portugal, Pascoa, terms that these\r\ntwo nations pass on to other festal Sundays. Illyria has Paska; Wales,\r\nPasg; Denmark, Paaske; France, Pâques; and we ourselves once used\r\nPasque, as is shown by the name of the anemone or pasque flower.\r\n\r\nAbout 844, Radbert, Abbot of Corbie, put forth a book upon the holy\r\nEucharist, in honour of which he was surnamed Paschasius; and, perhaps,\r\nthis suggested the use of words thence derived for children born at that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nCambrai has Pasqua, Pasquina, Pasquette, from 1400 to 1500. Pasquale,\r\nPaschino, Paschina, Pasquier, Pascal, all flourished in Italy and\r\nFrance; and in Spain a Franciscan monk, named Pascual, was canonized.\r\nPascoe was married in St. Columb Major, in 1452; Paschal is there the\r\nfeminine; and many other instances can be easily found to the further\r\nhonour of the name. There lived, however, a cobbler at Rome, the butt of\r\nhis friends, who gave his name of Paschino to a statue of an ancient\r\ngladiator that had been newly disinterred, and set up in front of the\r\nOrsini palace, exciting the waggery of the idle Romans by his likeness\r\nto the cobbler. Paschino, the gladiator, proved a convenient block for\r\nposting of lampoons and satires, insomuch that the generic term at Rome\r\nfor such squibs became paschinado, whence our English word pasquinade.\r\n\r\nI have seen Easter as a Christian name upon a tombstone in Ripon\r\nCathedral, bearing the date 1813; but as I have also seen it in a Prayer\r\nBook belonging to a woman who calls herself Esther, it is possible that\r\nthis may be a blunder of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, soon after the Reformation, an inclination in\r\nEngland to name children after the vernacular titles of holy days. In\r\n1675, Passion occurs at Bovey Tracey, in Devon; another in 1712, at\r\nHemiock; and Pentecost is far from uncommon in old registers. At Madron,\r\nin Cornwall, in 1632, appear the masculine, Pentecost, and feminine,\r\nPentecoste; and in Essex, an aunt and niece appear, both called by this\r\nsingular festal name, in honour of Whit Sunday. In 1643, I find it again\r\nat St. Columb Major. It means, of course, fifty, and is Greek.\r\n\r\nEaster is called Λάμπα (the bright day) in Greek, because of the\r\nlighting of candles that takes place at midnight in every church. Can it\r\nbe from this that the Eastern saint of the 10th of February, who\r\nsuffered at Antioch in Pisidia, was called Charalampios, Χαραλάμπιος, a\r\nname which is still used in the Ionian Islands, and is imitated in\r\nRussia as Kharalampia, or Kharalamm. Its component parts are καρα (joy),\r\nand a derivative from λαμπάς (a torch); and we might explain it either\r\nglad-light, or the joy of Easter.[92]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  Kitto, _Bible Cyclopædia_; _Church Festivals and their Household\r\n  Words_; Grimm, _Acta Sanctorum_; Pott; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION V.—_Sunday Names._\r\n\r\nSabbath (rest), in Hebrew, distinguished the seventh day, set apart from\r\nthe service of the world in memory, first, of the cessation of the work\r\nof creation, and next, of the repose of the Israelites after their\r\nlabours in Egypt.\r\n\r\nWhile the Sabbath was still the sacred day, it does not appear to have\r\nsuggested any historical name, except that of the father of Joses\r\nBarsabas, whose father must have been Sabas. In 532, however, was born\r\nin Cappadocia, Sabas, who became one of the most distinguished\r\npatriarchs of the monks in Palestine; and in 372, one of the first\r\nconverts to Christianity among the Goths, then stationed in Wallachia,\r\nwho had taken the name of Sabas, was martyred by being thrown into the\r\nriver Musæus, now Mussovi. The locality attached the Slavonians to his\r\nname, and Sava is still common among them, as is Ssava in Russia.\r\n\r\nWhether Sabea or Sabra, the king of Egypt’s daughter, whom St. George\r\nsaved from the dragon, was named with any view to St. Sabas, cannot be\r\nguessed. I have seen the name in an old English register, no doubt in\r\nhonour of the exploit of our patron saint.\r\n\r\nThe day of rest gave place to the day of Resurrection, the Lord’s day,\r\nas we still emphatically call it, after the example of the Apostles.\r\n\r\nSt. John called it Κυριακή ἡμέρα (the Lord’s day), and in this he has\r\nbeen followed by the entire Greek Church, with whom Sundays are still\r\nKyriakoi.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the translators of the Septuagint that first gave\r\nits highest sense to Κύριος (Kyrios), a lord or master, from the verb\r\nκυρέω (kyreo), to find, obtain, or possess.\r\n\r\nSt. Kyriakos, or, as Rome spelt him, Cyriacus, was martyred under\r\nDiocletian, had his relics dug up afterwards, and his arm given to the\r\nabbey of Altdorff, in Alsace. From him came the Roman Ciriaco and the\r\nFrench Cyriac, all of which may mean either “the Lord’s,” or “the Sunday\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time a little Kyriakos of Iconium, a child of three years\r\nold, fell, with his mother, Julitta, into the hands of the persecutors\r\nof Seleucia. The prefect tried to save the child, but he answered all\r\nthe promises and threats alike with “I am a Christian,” till, in a rage,\r\nthe magistrate dashed his head on the steps of the tribunal, and his\r\nmother, in her tortures, thanked Heaven for her child’s glorious\r\nmartyrdom. Their touching story made a deep impression, perhaps the more\r\nfrom the wide dispersion of their supposed relics, which were said to\r\nhave been brought from Antioch by St. Amator, to Auxerre, about the year\r\n400, and thence were dispersed through many French towns, and villages,\r\nin which he was called St. Quiric or St. Cyr.\r\n\r\nThe ancient British Church became acquainted with the mother and child\r\nthrough the Gallic. Welsh hagiology owns them as “Gwyl Gwric ac Elidan;”\r\nand Cwrig has been continued as a name in Wales, whilst, on the other\r\nhand, the child is equally honoured in his native East—by Russia,\r\nArmenia, Abyssinia, and even the Nestorian Christians. He is probably\r\nthe source of the Illyrian names Cirjar and Cirko.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Portuguese.  │    Spanish.   │\r\n   │Cyril          │Cyrille        │Cyrillo        │Cirilo         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │    German.    │   Russian.    │   Illyrian.   │\r\n   │Cirillo        │Cyrill         │Keereel        │Cirilo         │\r\n   │               │               │               │Ciril          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Ciro           │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nKyrillos (Κύριλλος) fell to the lot of two great doctors of the\r\nChurch—patriarchs, the one of Alexandria, the other of Jerusalem; also\r\nto two martyrs, one a young boy, and thus it became widely known. The\r\nWelsh had it as Girioel, which really is nearer the pronunciation than\r\nour own Cyril, with a soft _C_. It is a name known everywhere, but more\r\nin favour in the East than the West, and of honourable memory to us for\r\nthe sake of Kyrillos Lucar, the Byzantine patriarch, the correspondent\r\nof Laud, and afterwards a martyr. Latterly fashion has somewhat revived\r\nit in England; and the feminine, Cyrilla, is known in Germany.\r\n\r\nProbably, however, this is only the diminutive of kyrios (a master), and\r\ndid not begin with a religious import.\r\n\r\nThe Latin equivalent for the Greek, Kyriake, was Dies Emera Dominica.\r\nThe immediate derivation of this word is in some doubt. It certainly is\r\nfrom Dominus; but there is some question whether this word be from\r\n_domo_ (to rule), a congener of the Greek δαμάω, and of our own _tame_;\r\nor if it be from _domus_ (a house), a word apparently direct from the\r\nGreek δόμος, from δέμω (to build); another branch from that same root,\r\nmeaning to rule or govern.\r\n\r\nDominicus, the adjective formed from this word, is found in the French\r\nterm for the Lord’s prayer, _l'Oraison Dominicale_, and it likewise\r\nnamed the Lord’s Day, Dies Dominica; Domenica, in Italy; Domingo, in\r\nSpain; Dimanche, in France. The first saint, who was probably so called\r\nfrom being born on a Sunday, was San Dominico of the Cuirass, a recluse\r\nof the Italian Alps, whose mortification consisted in wearing an iron\r\ncuirass, which he never took off except to scourge himself. He died in\r\n1024; and a still sterner disciplinarian afterwards bore the same name,\r\nthat Dominico whom the pope beheld in a vision upbearing the Church as a\r\npillar, and who did his utmost to extirpate the Albigenses; whose name\r\nis connected with the foundation of the Inquisition, and whose\r\nbrotherhood spread wherever Rome’s dominion was owned. He is saint for\r\nnamesakes out of Romanist lands, but in these it occurs, and has an\r\nItalian feminine, Domenica; for short, Menica. Perhaps this likewise\r\naccounts for the Spanish Mendez and Mencia. This last may, however, be\r\nfrom Monica, the mother of St. Augustine, whose name has never been\r\naccounted for. It may be from some unknown language; but is sometimes\r\nsupposed to be from _moneo_, to advise. Monique is rather a favourite\r\nwith French peasants, and Moncha was Irish, but it has not been as\r\ncommon as it deserves.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    Irish.     │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Domnech        │Dominique      │Domenico       │Domingo        │\r\n   │Dominic        │               │Domenichino    │Mendez         │\r\n   │               │               │Menico         │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │   Slavonic.   │  Hungarian.   │   Servian.    │\r\n   │Domingos       │Dominik        │Domokos        │Dominic        │\r\n   │               │Domogoj        │               │Menz           │\r\n   │               │Dinko          │               │Menzel         │\r\n   │               │Dunko          │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Slavonians have, however, a name for their Sunday in their own\r\ntongue—Nedele; and have formed from it the Nedelco of the Bulgarians;\r\nthe Nedeljko, Nedan, Nedo, and the feminine, Nedelijka and Neda, of the\r\nIllyrians.\r\n\r\nI am aware of no other names from the days of the week, except the\r\n‘Thursday October Christian’ of Pitcairn’s Island, who was probably so\r\ncalled in recollection of the Man Friday.\r\n\r\nAll Saints' Day has furnished Spain with Santos; and France, or rather\r\nSan Domingo, with Toussaint, unless this last be a corruption, or,\r\nperhaps, a pious adaptation, of Thorstein—Thor’s stone, turned into All\r\nSaints.[93]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; _Church Festivals and Household Words_; Butler; Rees, _Welsh\r\n  Saints_; Facciolati; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION I.—_The Keltic Race._\r\n\r\nWe now pass to a class of names whose associations belong almost\r\nentirely to the modern world, yet whose history is far more obscure than\r\nthat of those on which we have previously dwelt.\r\n\r\nFrom the Hebrew, the European family have derived their religion; from\r\nthe Greek, their ideas; from the Roman, their laws; from the Teuton,\r\ntheir blood and their energy; but from the Kelt they have taken little\r\nbut their fanciful romance. In only one country has the Kelt been\r\ndominant, and then with a Latinized speech, and a Teutonic name,\r\ntestifying to the large modifications that he must have undergone.\r\n\r\nAmong the rugged moors and cliffs which fence Western Europe from the\r\nAtlantic waves, he did indeed preserve his freedom, but without\r\namalgamation with other nations; and in lands where he fell under\r\nsubjection, he was so lost among the conquerors as to be untraceable in\r\nlanguage or feature, and with the exception of the Gaul, has bequeathed\r\nnothing of his character to the fused race upon his soil.\r\n\r\nWe trace the Hebrew nation with certainty from its majestic source; the\r\nGreek shines on us in a dazzling sunrise of brilliant myth; the Roman,\r\nin a grave, stern dawn of characteristic legend; but of the earlier\r\nprogress of the wild, impulsive Kelt we have but the faintest\r\nindications.\r\n\r\nMuch as he loved his forefathers, keen as was his delight in celebrating\r\nthe glories of his race, oral tradition contented him, and very strong\r\nwas the pressure from the neighbouring nations before his bards recorded\r\nanything in writing, even the long genealogies hitherto preserved in\r\neach man’s accumulated names. The beauty of their legends did indeed\r\nrecommend them to the general store-house of European fancy, but though\r\nthe spirit may be Keltic, the body through which it comes is almost\r\nalways Teutonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION II.—_The Keltic Languages._\r\n\r\nThe Keltic nations used languages which showed that they came from the\r\nIndo-European root, and which are still spoken in the provinces where\r\nthey remain. They have no really ancient literature, and were left at\r\nthe mercy of wild tongues, so that their losses have been very great,\r\nand the divergence of dialects considerable.\r\n\r\nThe great and distinguishing feature of the entire class is their\r\npeculiar inflections, which, among other puzzling features, insert an\r\naspirate after the primary consonant, so as entirely to change its\r\nsound, as for instance in an oblique case, _mor_, great, would become\r\n_mhor_, and be pronounced _vor_, to the eternal confusion of people of\r\nother nations, who, however the vowel or the end of a word might alter,\r\nalways trusted to know it by the main syllable. A large number of\r\nguttural sounds distinguished these languages, and some of these were\r\nannihilated by the ensuing aspiration; but when spelling began, the\r\ncorpses of the two internecine letters were still left in the middle of\r\nthe word, to cumber the writer and puzzle the reader, so that the very\r\nenunciation of a written sentence requires a knowledge of grammar.\r\n\r\nThe vowels likewise sometimes change in the body of the word when it\r\nbecomes plural, and the identification of plurals and of cases with\r\ntheir parent word is so difficult that few persons ever succeed in the\r\nstudy of Keltic, except those who have learnt it from their mothers or\r\nnurses, and even they are not always agreed how to write it\r\ngrammatically.\r\n\r\nThe Keltic splits into two chief branches, so different that Cæsar\r\nhimself remarked that the Gauls and Cimbrians did not use the same\r\nlanguage. For the sake of convenience these two branches are called by\r\nphilologists the Gaelic and the Cymric. The first is the stock which has\r\nsince divided into the Gaelic of the Highlands, the Irish of Ireland,\r\nand the Manx of the little intermediate isle. In fact they are nearly\r\none; old Gaelic and old Irish are extremely alike when they can be found\r\nwritten, and though they have since diverged, the general rules continue\r\nto be the same; and some of the chief differences may be owing to the\r\nfact, that while the Highlanders have adopted the Roman alphabet, the\r\nnative Irish still adhere to the Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nThe Cymric is still spoken in Wales and Brittany, and only died out a\r\ncentury ago in Cornwall. Welsh and Breton agree in so many points that\r\nthe natives of either country are said to be able to understand one\r\nanother, though they would be entirely unintelligible to an Irishman or\r\nHighlander. Indeed it may be doubted whether Greek and Latin are not\r\nmore nearly akin than the two shoots of the Keltic tree. One great\r\ndifference is that the _p_ of the Kymric always becomes _k_ or _c_ hard\r\nin the Gadhaelic: thus _plant_ or children in Wales, are the well-known\r\nGaelic _clan_; _Paisg_, Easter, is _Cisg_; _pen_, a head, is _caen_; and\r\nthe Cornish word _Pentyr_, the head of the land, or promontory, is the\r\nsame as the Scottish _Cantyre_.[94]\r\n\r\nThe Gauls had been completely Romanized in the South before they heard\r\nof Christianity. They gave up Greek and Roman idols rather than Druidism\r\nwhen they listened to the Gospel. It is thought that the first seeds\r\nwere sown by St. Paul, and that afterwards the Eastern Church at\r\nEphesus, under St. John, had much communication with them. Britain\r\nprobably owed her first gleams of light to the imprisonment of\r\nCaractacus and his family at Rome; but however this might be, Gaul\r\nfurnished hosts of martyrs in the persecution, and Britain did her part\r\nin testifying to the truth. Many districts long remained unconverted,\r\nhowever, in both countries. St. Martin is said to have completed the\r\nconversion of Gaul in the end of the third century, and in Wales St.\r\nGermain still found a host to baptize in the fifth century. Indeed, the\r\npredominance of heathen remains over Christian, have made antiquaries\r\nvery doubtful whether Britain could have been by any means universally\r\nconverted at the time of the fall of the Roman empire. It had, however,\r\nsent forth one great missionary, namely, St. Patrick, from the northern\r\nprovince of Valentia. He found a feeble Church in Ireland, but so\r\nenlarged its borders and won all hearts, that from his time that island\r\nwas Christian in name, and filled with such clusters of hermitages and\r\nconvents as to win its title of the Isle of Saints.\r\n\r\nThis Keltic Church, with its eastern traditions, was the special\r\nmissionary Church of these little heeded times. From Ireland, St.\r\nColumba went forth to Iona, whence he and his disciples gradually\r\nconverted the Picts; and though St. Gregory’s mission laid the\r\nfoundations of the polity of the Anglo-Saxon Church in Britain, there\r\nwere the Scottish Aidan, the Welsh Chad, and Gallic Birinus doing the\r\nwork quietly, in which the Roman monks had been less successful. From\r\nIreland again, St. Columbanus, St. Gall, and many others set forth to\r\ncomplete the work of conversion in France and Switzerland, and many\r\nchurches and convents regard as their founders and patrons, obscure\r\nIrish hermits forgotten in their own country. These have been the chief\r\ndiffusers of Keltic names, being called after some hereditary native\r\nword, which their saintliness was to raise to high honour.[95]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  Max Müller; _Encyclopædia Britannica_; Villemarqué, _Legoindec’s\r\n  Dictionary_; Hanmer, _Chronicle_; Clark, _Student’s Handbook of Comp.\r\n  Grammar_; Prichard, _Celtic Nations_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  Knight, _Pictorial History_; Mazzaroth; Knight, _Celt, Roman, and\r\n  Saxon_; Grimm, _Deutsche Mythologie_; Jones, _Welsh Sketches_; _Irish\r\n  Poems_; Montalembert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION III.—_Keltic Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nThe Kelts were highly poetical and romantic in their nomenclature. In\r\ngeneral their names were descriptive; many referred to complexion, and\r\nmany more described either masculine courage or feminine grace and\r\nsweetness. But, unfortunately, the language is so uncertain, and its\r\ncommentators are so much at war, that in dealing with these, after the\r\nwell-criticized ancient tongues, is like passing from firm ground to a\r\nquaking bog, and in many cases there is but a choice of conjectures to\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\nThe names to be examined are of various kinds. First, the historical\r\nones that have come through Latin writers, terribly disguised, but the\r\nowners of them certain to have existed. These are usually more Cymric\r\nthan Gaelic, and Welsh and Breton writers find explanations for them. A\r\nfew truly mythological ones will be considered with these, and placed\r\naccording to the order—if order it can be called—assigned to their\r\nsupposed owners in the pedigree of Brut, in which England used to\r\nbelieve on the word of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the Welsh on that of\r\ntheir native chronicle of Brut. Then follow a most controverted\r\ncollection, chiefly of the two Gaelic nations. They were the property of\r\na set of heroes called the Feen, who are the great ancestry of the\r\nchiefs of the Scottish race in both islands, and who are said to have\r\nperformed fabulous exploits at some distant period, which gains some\r\nsort of date from the poem representing Ossian, the last survivor of the\r\nband, as extremely miserable under the teaching of St. Patrick. The fact\r\nwas probably that the floating myths of the Gael attached themselves to\r\nsome real adventurous band, and the date is no more to be depended on\r\nthan those of Geoffrey of Monmouth; but it gives a point by which to\r\narrange the names still in great part surviving both in Ireland and\r\nScotland, though often confused with those imported from other\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nAfter this follows the cycle of names made popular by the romances of\r\nKing Arthur’s court, which naturally find their place at the time of the\r\nfall of the Roman power in England. These, as far as they can be\r\nunderstood or interpreted at all, are Cymric, and some have become\r\ntolerably well known throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe different classes connected with one or other of these will nearly\r\ndispose of all the Keltic names worth notice. The remaining will chiefly\r\nbelong to the saints, in which Wales, Brittany, and Ireland were\r\nparticularly prolific. The odd thing is that all the Welsh saints were\r\nin some way or other of royal birth, so that the royalty of Wales must\r\nhave been peculiarly pious. Brittany, likewise, had sundry hermits; and\r\nIreland deserved its title of the Isle of Saints, though, as will be\r\nseen, some of them were of a strangely Irish order, and regarded as\r\nstrong cursing powers.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic race had the remarkable custom of calling their children the\r\nservant, the disciple, or the votaress of the patron saint, and it is\r\nnot till recent times that the prefixes Giolla, Maol, and Cailleach have\r\nbeen entirely dropped, and their traces are often remaining in\r\nappellations in Ireland and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe name was entirely personal, not hereditary; but the pride of\r\nancestry caused the father’s, grandfather’s, forefather’s names, to the\r\nremotest generation, to be heaped upon one head, connected in Welsh by\r\n_Mab_, or, as it was contracted, _Ap_.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh, about the fifteenth century, found these pedigree names\r\nunmanageable in contact with ordinary society, and contented themselves\r\neach with one ancestral surname for good. Some incorporated their Ap, as\r\nPryce, Ap Rhys, Pugh, or Ap Hugh; some, in English fashion, adding the\r\npossessive _s_ to the end of the father’s name, like the hosts of\r\nJoneses and Williamses; others took some favourite name from the roll of\r\nancestry, or called themselves after their estates.\r\n\r\nIn Gaelic the word Mac, the son, or O, or _ua_, the grandson, connected\r\nthe person with the ancestor whose name was chosen.\r\n\r\nThe Keltic taste in names was of the grand order, generally in many\r\nsyllables, and lofty in sense and sound, much in the style of the Red\r\nIndian. Thus we find Brithomar, the great Briton; Bathanat, son of the\r\nboar; Louarn, the fox; Carvilius, friend of power, among the Kymric\r\nnations of England and the Continent: and in less complimentary style,\r\nMandubrath, man of black treason. This man of black treason was, in\r\nBritain, Avarddwy Bras, also called one of the three disgraceful men of\r\nBritain. It is said that Caswallon had murdered Avarddwy’s father, and\r\nafterwards set out on what the _Triads_ call one of the three unwise\r\narmaments, which weakened the force of the country. The cause is\r\nromantically described by the _Triads_ to have been, that his lady-love,\r\nFlur, had been carried away by a Prince of Gascony to be presented to\r\nJulius Cæsar; moreover, the _Mabinogion_ says, he and his two friends\r\nwent as far as Rome to recover her, disguised as shoemakers, whence they\r\nare called the three bold shoemakers of the Isle of Britain. The aid\r\nthat he gave the Gauls does, in fact, seem to have attracted the notice\r\nof Cæsar, and the black treason was Avarddwy’s invitation to the Romans.\r\nHe was the father of Aregwydd Voeddog, whose second name, derived from\r\nvictory, was certainly the same as Boadicea, though her deed identifies\r\nher with Cartismandua. Caswallon, or Cassivellaunus, as the Romans\r\ncalled him, is sometimes explained as Cas-gwall-lawn, chief of great\r\nhatred, sometimes as lord of the Cassi. The Gaels have many grand men’s\r\nnames, but, perhaps, have used the most poetry in those of their women.\r\nFeithfailge, honeysuckle ringlets; Lassairfhina or Lassarina, flame or\r\nblush of the wine; Lassair, or flame, the same in effect as the Italian\r\nFiamma; Alma, all good, a real old Erse name, before the babes of\r\nSeptember 1854, were called Alma, after the Crimean river, which\r\nprobably bore a Keltic name; Bebhirn, or, as Macpherson writes it,\r\nVevina, the sweet woman; Essa, the nurse; Gelges, white swan; Luanmaisi,\r\nmoon fairness; Ligach, pearly.\r\n\r\nYet thirst had her namesake, Ita; Diédrè was fear; Dorvenn, sullen;\r\nUailsi, pride; Unchi, contention.\r\n\r\nAll of these, and many besides, have entirely fallen into desuetude, and\r\nall the Keltic countries have a practice of adopting names from their\r\nneighbours, supposed to answer to their own, but often without the\r\nslightest affinity thereto.\r\n\r\nThus Anmcha, courageous, is supposed to be translated by Ambrose;\r\nAneslis is rendered by Stanislaus; Fachtna, is Festus; Baothgalach, or\r\nrashly courageous, Boethius.\r\n\r\nCorruptions must be permitted to our English tongues and throats, which\r\nbreak down at a guttural, so it is no wonder that Dorchaidha, or\r\npatronymic O'Dorchaidhe, should be sometimes turned into D'Arcy,\r\nsometimes D'Orsay, and sometimes into Darkey, which really translates\r\nthe word; and sometimes Darcy; but it is rather hard when we have to\r\nread Archibald for Gillespie, and Edward for Diarmaid.[96]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  Villemarqué; O'Donovan; _Highland Society’s Gaelic Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                         ANCIENT KELTIC NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION I.—_Welsh Mythic Names._\r\n\r\nWelsh myths we say advisedly, for whether these were really Druidical\r\nmyths or not, they have become so much disguised by Welsh bards, down to\r\nChristian times, that there is no knowing what was the original\r\nframework. Our concern is with the names connected with these\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nThe primary personages of semi-divine rank in these traditions are Hu\r\nGadarn, or the Mighty, the sun god, and his wife Ceridwen. It is\r\nbelieved that the two sacred islands of Iona and Mona were both\r\noriginally Ynysgwaw Hu, the island of the worship of Hu. Others,\r\nhowever, say, that Iona was only I-thon, or isle of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe word Hu is not explained; but it has passed into a name in Wales and\r\nBrittany. Old French has the name inflected as Hue, Hues, Huon, and the\r\nfeminine Huette; and the true Anglicized Welsh form is Hu or Hew, though\r\nit is now universally confounded with the Teutonic Hugh, from _hugur_,\r\nthought, with which it may be cognate, and the Welsh patronymic Ap Hu is\r\nalways spelt Pugh.\r\n\r\nThe _Triads_ speak of Aed Mawr, or Aedd, as father of Pridain, but he\r\nmay have been either a title of Hu, or else the god himself. Aodh is, in\r\nfact, in sound and sense, closely related to the Greek αίθω (aitho), and\r\nour heat is of the same kin.\r\n\r\nDr. Meyer thinks this Aed Mawr of the _Triads_ was the forefather from\r\nwhom the Ædui mentioned by Cæsar were called, and further derives from\r\nhim Cæer Aeddon, or Dun Aeddon, Dun Edin, or Edinburgh. Yet, on the\r\nother hand, it is a part of our English faith that Auld Reekie is our\r\nNorthumbrian Edwin’s burgh.\r\n\r\nAed, Aeddon, Aodh, Aedhan, were far more popular names than those\r\nderived from Hu. Aeddan is lamented by Aneurin as a British warrior\r\nslain among the victims of Henghist’s treachery; and two Aoidhs reigned,\r\nthe one in Connaught, the other in Scotland, in 570; and to the latter\r\nof these, called by Scottish historians Aidan, or Edan, they ascribe the\r\nfoundation of their capital; but it was at that time in the possession\r\nof the Angles, and if called after any Aodh, it must have been after an\r\nearlier one. The Irish Aodh is said to have been about to expel the\r\nbards, but to have been prevented by the intercession of St. Columb.\r\n\r\nAt one time Ireland was afflicted with thirteen contemporary Aodhs; and\r\nat least two so called reigned in Scotland—Aodhfin, or the white, the\r\nEthfine of historians, and Aoidh, or Eth, the swift-footed. So common\r\nwas the name among the Irish that one hundred Aodhs and one hundred\r\nAidans or Oédans were killed in the battle of Maghrath. The MacAodhas of\r\nIreland were once many in number; and became MacHugh or Magee; in\r\nScotland, Mackay; or were sometimes translated into Hughson or Hewson.\r\nBut the most interesting person so called is known to us as Aidan. He\r\nvisited Wales and Scotland, became a monk of Iona, and then went forth\r\nas a missionary to the North of England. He was the friend of the\r\nadmirable Oswald, free of hand, king of Deira, who used to interpret his\r\nKeltic speech to the Angle population; and his gentle teaching won to\r\nthe Church multitudes whom the harshness of former missionaries had\r\nrepelled. He is reckoned as first bishop of Lindisfarn, and has left his\r\nname to sundry churches of St. Aidan. Aoidhne, or Eithne, was the Irish\r\nfeminine once distinguished, but now disused.\r\n\r\nAidan is still a female name among some Welsh families.\r\n\r\nAnother Irish St. Aeddan, who was bishop of Ferns about the year 632,\r\nhas a most curious variety of namesakes—some from his baptismal name,\r\nothers from his pet appellation Móedóg, that is M'Óedóg, namely Ma\r\nOtdóg, my little Aodh. This strange custom of prefixing the possessive\r\npronoun, first person singular, to the proper name of a saint was very\r\ngeneral. Maodhòg, as it has since become, is still common in Wexford,\r\nwhere the Irish language has disappeared. It is pronounced and written\r\nMogne, and is perpetuated in honour of the Saint of Ferns. Madog, or\r\nMadawc, was the usual form in Wales, where it has always been in great\r\nfavour. Madawc, prince of Powysland, who died in 1158, in great favour\r\nwith Henry II. The Latin translation of Aidan, Aideus, or Aidanus, has\r\nadhered to him in Basse Bretagne, but has there been cut down into Dé,\r\nSt. Dé being the appellation of a village there, the church of which is\r\ndedicated to Mogne, is by Irish Protestants often Anglicized as Aidan,\r\nby the Roman Catholics as Moses.\r\n\r\nThe leek is said to have been used by the Welsh in the worship of\r\nCeridwen, the wife of Hu. Afterwards a story rose that, in one of\r\nCadwallawn’s battles, his Welshmen marked themselves with leeks from a\r\ngarden hard by, and the story was later transferred to the Welsh troops\r\nof the Black Prince in France.\r\n\r\nCed, or Cyridwen, shows no namesakes; but _buadh_, or _budd_, victory,\r\nfurnished for her the epithet of Buddug, or Buddud; and, perhaps, she is\r\nthe Boundonica mentioned by Dion Cassius as a Keltic goddess. Probably\r\nit was either as a victorious omen, or else in honour of her, that the\r\nname of Buddug was given to that fierce chieftainess of the Iceni, whose\r\nsavage vengeance for her wrongs has won for her a very disproportionate\r\nfame, as much changed as her name, when we call it Bonduca, or, more\r\nusually, Boadicea. It has not met with much repetition, yet we have\r\nheard of a family so patriotic as to contain both Caractacus and\r\nBoadicea. Buadhach was, however, long a man’s name in Ireland, and\r\nBudhic was one of the early Armorican princes.\r\n\r\nGwion, an unlucky dwarf, destroyed by Ceridwen, seems to have left his\r\nname behind him, whether it be as M. Pitre Chevalier explains it,\r\n_esprit_, sense, or be connected with the Welsh _gwyth_, and Cornish\r\n_gwg_, anger.\r\n\r\nAneurin mentions a knight named Gwiawn as having been slain in the\r\nbattle of Cattraeth; and Gwion is a knight of Arthur’s court, figuring\r\nas Sir Guy among the knights of the Round Table, and furnishing Spenser\r\nwith his Sir Guyon, the hero of the second ‘Book of Courtesie’ in his\r\n_Faerie Queen_.\r\n\r\nGuy has since been a favourite name, but it has become so entangled with\r\nthe Latin Vitus that it is almost impossible to distinguish the Keltic\r\nfrom the Roman name. It appears to have prevailed in France very early\r\nas Guy, Guies, Guyon, in the feminine Guiette; and besides the Sicilian\r\ninfant martyr, Vitus, obtained two patrons, St. Guy, the Poor Man of\r\nAnderlecht, a pilgrim to Jerusalem, who died in 1014; and the Italian,\r\nSt. Guido, abbot of Pomposa, in Ferrara, who died in 1042. Both lived\r\nlong after their name had become so popular, that it could not have\r\ndepended upon them. Queen Matilda, in her Bayeux tapestry, labels as\r\nWido, the Count Guy of Ponthieu, who captured Harold on his ill-starred\r\nexpedition to Normandy, and thus she evidently does not consider him as\r\nVitus.\r\n\r\nGuy and Guido were both fairly frequent with us, until ‘Gunpowder\r\nTreason’ gave a sinister association to the sound of Guido Fawkes, and\r\nthe perpetual celebrations of the 5th of November, with the burning of\r\nGuy Fawkes in effigy, have given a meaning to the term of Guy, that will\r\nprobably continue long after the last tar-barrel has flamed and the last\r\ncracker exploded over his doom.\r\n\r\nGuido and Guidone were the proper Italian forms, much used in the whole\r\nPeninsula, and appearing in Ariosto’s poem in the person of Guidon\r\nSelvaggio, a rustic, uncivilized knight. From the sound it was long\r\nimagined that the names came either from _guide_ or from _guidon_, a\r\nbanner or ensign; but there can be no doubt that either the Keltic Gwion\r\nor the Latin Vitus was their true origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SECTION II.—_Lear and his Daughters._\r\n\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth made the eleventh of his kings, descended from\r\nBrute, to be called Leir, and live at Leircester, or Leicester, on the\r\nriver Sore, somewhere about the time of the prophet Elisha.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the earliest authorities for the story of Lear and the\r\nungrateful daughters, whom he calls Gonorilla and Regan. He gives the\r\nname of Cordeilla to the reserved but faithful daughter who could not\r\npay lip service, but redeemed her father’s kingdom when he was exiled\r\nand misused by her flattering sisters. It was a very remarkable\r\nconception of character, even thus barely narrated, without the lovely\r\nendowments with which we have since learnt to invest the good daughter.\r\nThe sequel in Geoffrey’s chronicle related, that after his kingdom was\r\nrestored, old Leir died in peace at Leicester, and was buried by\r\nCordeilla “in a certain vault which she ordered to be made for him under\r\nthe river Sore, at Leicester, and which had been built originally under\r\nthe ground to the honour of the god Janus; and here all the workmen of\r\nthe city, upon the anniversary solemnity of that festival, used to begin\r\ntheir yearly labours.”\r\n\r\nHe further narrates that Cordeilla was dethroned by her nephews, and\r\ncommitted suicide in despair. To this story adhered both the old\r\nballad-monger and Spenser, in the history studied by Sir Guyon; but\r\nShakespeare loved his sweet Cordelia too well to stain her with\r\nself-murder, and, though omitting all allusion to Christianity, made her\r\nin all her ways and actions a true Christian, and never perhaps showed\r\nmore consummate art than in producing so perfect an effect with a person\r\nso chary of her words.\r\n\r\nWhence did Geoffrey get the story which has produced such fruits?\r\n\r\nLear (_gen._), Lir, is the sea. He is also a mythological personage, a\r\ngod in the elder Irish belief, and father of Mănănnán, the Erse Neptune.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, later ballads humanized Lear, and made him the father of\r\nMănănnán, one of the Tuath De Danan, or early conquerors of Ireland, and\r\nLord of the Isle of Man, which is said to be called after him. There is\r\na tradition in Londonderry that his spirit lives in an enchanted castle\r\nin the waves of Magilligan, and that his magic ship appears every\r\nseventh year. Moreover, the daughters of Mănănnán, granddaughters of\r\nLear, were called Ainè and Aoiffè, and had a desperate quarrel about\r\ntheir husbands' excellence in hunting.\r\n\r\nWales, on its side, shows in the Isle of Anglesea a cromlech, called the\r\ntomb of Bronwen, daughter of King Llyr or Leirus. The tomb was opened in\r\n1813, and an ancient urn, once probably containing ashes, was found\r\nthere. It seems that a somewhat more substantial Llyr lived about the\r\ntime of the Roman conquest, and was the father of Bronwen, who married\r\nthe king of Ireland, was ill-treated by him, and received a box on the\r\near, which was one of the three fatal insults of the Isle of Britain.\r\nThis lady is very probably the Bronwen of the cromlech; but the\r\nconjecture of the Rev. Edward Davies is, that in the story of King Lear,\r\nwe may have the remains of an ancient myth.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly remarkable that the notion of Lyr, in connection with\r\nturbulent daughters or granddaughters, should be common to both Britain\r\nand Ireland. Mr. Davies explains Cordelia to have been originally\r\nCreirdyddlydd, the token of the overflowing, also called Creirwy, or the\r\ntoken of the egg. _Creir_ is a token, the sacred article on which a man\r\nmakes oath, whence it came to mean either a relic or a jewel.\r\nCreirdyddlydd might thus be the jewel of the sea, or the token of the\r\nflood. At any rate, Creirdyddlydd or Creirwy is a creation of ancient\r\nWelsh poetry, once mythical, the daughter of the sea, Llyr or Llud, on\r\nwhich Geoffrey seized for his history. Bronwen, or white bosom, is\r\neither another daughter of Lyr, or else Creirdyddlydd under another\r\nname, and is supposed to have been the British Proserpine. Both Bronwen\r\nand Creirwy are called Gwrvorwyn, man-maid, or virago, and it does not\r\nseem impossible that here we see the origin of Cordelia, Regan, and\r\nGoneril, as they have been adapted to English pronunciation, the token\r\nof the overflowing, the fair bosom, and the virago. Surely these are the\r\ndaughters of the ocean, rebellious and peaceful. Dynwen, too, is the\r\nwhite wave, the patroness of lovers; and as we shall find by-and-by wave\r\nnames are remarkably common among the Welsh.\r\n\r\nLear is also called Llwyd, the grey, or the extended, a fitting title\r\nfor the sea, and which has passed on to form Lloyd, so common as a Welsh\r\nChristian and surname, and adopted in England as Floyd.\r\n\r\nCreirdyddlydd has due justice done her in the _Mabinogion_, where we\r\nfurther learn that she remains with her father till the day of doom, and\r\nthat in the mean time two kings, Gwyn ab Nudd and Gwythir mab Graidiawn,\r\nhave a battle for her hand on every May-day.\r\n\r\nCordula is set down in Welsh and German calendars on the 22nd of October\r\nas one of the 11,000 virgins, her feast following that of St. Ursula. It\r\nmay be remembered that St. Ursula was said to be Cornish; and that her\r\nonly recorded companion should bear a Cymric name, is in favour of some\r\nshade of foundation for her story. Kordula is in consequence a German\r\nname. Kordula was a princess of Lingen in 1473; and Michel and Kordel\r\nare two children in German household tradition so constantly falling\r\ninto mishaps as to have become a proverb for folly.\r\n\r\nThe Germans fancy Cordula is a diminutive of the Latin _cor_, a heart;\r\nothers have wildly made it the feminine of _Cordeleo_, lion heart, and\r\nit has been confused with Delia, the epithet of Diana, from Delos, her\r\nbirthplace; but Creirdyddlydd is certainly its origin, and remembering\r\nthat in Welsh _d_ is softened and aspirated by being doubled, is not far\r\nfrom it in sound. Cordelia is hereditary in some Irish families; but is\r\nchiefly used for love of Shakespeare’s heroine of filial love.\r\n\r\nBronwen makes her appearance again in the romance of _Sir Tristram_,\r\nunder the name of Brengwain, the maid of Yseulte. When the Lady Yseulte\r\nwas sent from her home in Ireland, under the escort of Tristram, to be\r\nmarried to King Mark, of Cornwall, her mother entrusted a love potion to\r\nBrengwain to be given on the wedding night.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a tempest arose on the voyage, and, in the consequent\r\nexhaustion, “Swete Ysonde, the fre, asked Brengwain a drink.” And\r\nBrengwain, bringing the magic cup by mistake, caused the fatal passion\r\nbetween Yseulte and the knight.\r\n\r\nEven the “hound that was there biside, yclept Hodain,” who licked up the\r\ndrops that were spilt of the philtre, became attached to the knight and\r\nlady with the same magic love.\r\n\r\nBronwen or Brengwain has since been in use as a Welsh female Christian\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe names of the granddaughters of the Irish King Lear were Aine and\r\nAoidheal, a spark, and their dispute was whose husband was the best\r\nhunter. Aine means joy or praise, and also fasting. Friday is\r\nDiah-Aoine, or fasting day in Irish. Aine, the daughter of Eogah-hal,\r\nwas looked on as queen of the fairies of South Munster, and her abode\r\nwas said to be Cnoc Aine or Knockany, the Hill of Aine, in county\r\nLimerick; Aoibhinn was queen of the fairies in Thomond or North Munster;\r\nUna, of those in Ormond.\r\n\r\nAine continued to be a favourite name in Ireland for many centuries; but\r\nin later times it has become the practice to Anglicize it as Anna and\r\nHannah, and possibly Anastasia, though this may have come more directly\r\nfrom the Greek. In 705 reigned a Scottish king called Ainbhceallach the\r\nGood. He is turned by different authors into Arinchellar, Armkelleth,\r\nAmberkelletus, etc., and his right one is either joyful war, or agile\r\nwar, or if with the _b_, ferocious war. He was too good for his savage\r\npeople, and was dethroned at the end of a year, and is usually mentioned\r\nby the few historians, who name him, as Amberkelleth.\r\n\r\nIt is evident then that Aine had come to Scotland with other Gaelic\r\nnames, and it is probable that this is the word that had come forth as\r\nAnaple or Annabell in Scotland long before the period of devotion to St.\r\nAnne. In 1158 Annabel Fitz Duncan, daughter to Duncan, Earl of Moray,\r\ncarried the name into the Lucie family; Annabella of Strathern appears\r\nin 1244; Annaple Drummond was wife to King Robert III. of Scotland,\r\nabout 1390; and thenceforth Anaple has been somewhat common in Scotland,\r\nwhile Anabla and Anabella are equally frequent in Ireland, and Annabella\r\nis occasionally used in England as Anna made a little finer.\r\n\r\nAoiffe was more generally used than Aine, but most likely is the origin\r\nof the Effie of Scotland, now always used as short for Euphemia, though\r\nthe Highland version of this name is now Aoirig, or Oighrigh. In other\r\nplaces Aoiffe seems to have been turned into Affrica. In the beginning\r\nof the twelfth century ‘Affrica,’ daughter of Fergus of Galway, married\r\n‘Olaus’ the Swarthy, King of Man, and her daughter ‘Effrica’ married\r\nSomerled, Thane of Argyle and Lord of the Isles, by whose genealogists\r\nshe seems to have been translated into Rachel. Africa is still used as a\r\nfemale name in the Isle of Man and in Ireland. Aoiffe was the wife of\r\nCuchullin in the Ossianic poetry, and Evir Allin and Evir Coma, properly\r\nAoibhir Aluin and Aoibhir Caomha, the pleasantly excellent and\r\npleasantly amiable, both appear there.\r\n\r\nThe recognized equivalent for Aoiffe was, however, Eva, beginning almost\r\nfrom the first Christian times, so that, until I found Aoiffe in such\r\nunquestionably heathen company as Lear and Mănănnán, I had made up my\r\nmind that she was the Gadhaelic pronunciation of our first mother.\r\n\r\nEva is found in the oldest documents extant in Scotland, and high in\r\ntheir genealogies: Eva O'Dwhine carried the blood of Diarmaid to the\r\nAnglo-Norman Campbells; Eva of Menteith married one of the first Earls\r\nof Lennox; and Alan, the first High Steward of Scotland, married Eve of\r\nTippermuir, and made her the ancestress of the Stuarts; about the same\r\ntime that the Irish Aoiffe or Eva, for she at least is known to have\r\nborne both names, was being wedded to stout Earl Strongbow.\r\n\r\nAevin, or Evin, is occasionally found in the house of Kennedy, but\r\nEveleen is by far the most common form of both names in Ireland, and has\r\nheld its ground unchanged. Eibhlin in Irish.\r\n\r\nTo our surprise, however, Aveline or Eveline make their appearance among\r\nthe Normans long before the marriage of the Earl of Pembroke. Aveline\r\nwas the name of the sister of Gunnar, the great-grandmother of William\r\nthe Conqueror; and Aveline or Eveline was so favourite a Norman name\r\nthat it well suits the Lady of the Garde Douloureuse in the _Betrothed_.\r\nAvelina de Longo-Campo, as the name is Latinized in old chronicles,\r\nmarried the last Earl of Lancaster, and was the mother of that heiress\r\nAvelina or Eveline, who, though short-lived and childless herself,\r\ncarried to her husband, Edmund Crouchback, and the sons of his\r\nsubsequent marriage, the great county of Lancaster, which made the power\r\nof the Red Rose formidable.\r\n\r\nEveline has never been frequent, but was never entirely forgotten in\r\nEngland, (for instance, an Eveline Elstove was baptized in 1539,) and\r\nwas revived as an ornamental name by Miss Burney’s _Evelina_. At present\r\nit is one of those most in vogue, but it ought not to be spelt with a\r\n_y_, unless it be intended to imitate the surname Evelyn, the old French\r\nform of the Latin _avellana_, a hazel. It was well that the tree-loving\r\nauthor of the _Sylva_ should bear such a surname, and from him and his\r\nfamily, men have frequently been christened by it; but ladies do not\r\nfollow the old Eveline of song and romance unless they use the true\r\nfeminine termination.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that several Keltic names should have come to us with the\r\nNormans. They may either have been of the set interchanged with the\r\nNorthmen at some pre-historical time, or old Keltic ones picked up from\r\nthe Gallic inhabitants of Neustria, or from the Bretons on the border.\r\nIn the present case, the latter supposition is the most likely, as the\r\nScandinavians do not seem to have used Eveline. It may of course be\r\nafter all a diminutive of Eve, but the alternate use of the initial _A_\r\nand _E_ seems to contradict this, and identify it with Aoiffe, daughter\r\nof the Irish King Lear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION III.—_Bri._\r\n\r\nThe root _brig_, meaning force or strength, is found in many branches of\r\nthe Indo-European tongues. It is considered to be akin to the Sanscrit\r\n_virja_, strength, and is found in the Greek verb βρίθω (_britho_), to\r\nbe heavy, or to outweigh, and the adjective βριαρός (_briaros_), strong.\r\nAnd thus it named the hundred-handed Titan, whom gods called Briareus,\r\nand men Ægeon, and who, in the Titanic revolution, was disposed of\r\neither in the Ægean Sea, or under Mount Ætna. Briennios, the surname of\r\nsome of the eastern emperors, must have come from this root.\r\n\r\nIn the Keltic tongues it again appears in Irish as _bri_ or _brigh_,\r\nforce or valour, and Bryn, height, answering to the Roman _virtus_ (a\r\nnear connection, as we shall presently see), and the old French word\r\n_brie_, peculiarly expressive of the gay, light Gallic courage, was a\r\nnow forgotten legacy from the ancient population. Thence came Brenhin,\r\nBren, or Bran, or, as the Romans made it, Brennus, a king or chief—well\r\nknown for the forays on Italy, and capture of Rome.\r\n\r\nAnother Brennus was the leader of a division of the great host of Gauls,\r\nthat, about B.C. 279, came out of Pannonia, and made a backward rush\r\ntowards the East. One of their bands settled in Asia Minor, and were the\r\nparents of the Galatians; but Brennus was less successful. He marched\r\nupon Delphi, promising his followers the plunder of the Temple; but was\r\ntotally defeated by the Delphians; and finding his army destroyed, and\r\nhimself severely wounded, put an end to his own life.\r\n\r\nNext time Bran comes to light, it is altogether in Welsh setting. The\r\n_Triads_ and the prolific _Genealogy of Welsh Saints_, are the\r\nauthorities for the existence of a prince of that name. Bran the\r\nBlessed, the son of Llyr Lledaith, and father of Caradwg, is, we are\r\ntold, one of the three blessed princes of Britain, having brought home\r\nthe faith of Christ from Rome, where he had been seven years as a\r\nhostage for his son Caradwg, whom the Romans put in prison after being\r\nbetrayed through the enticement, deceit, and plotting of Cartismandua,\r\nor by her Welsh name, Avegwydo Foeddog, the daughter of Avarwy, who\r\nbetrayed Caswallon. Her act is called by the _Triads_ one of the three\r\nsecret treasons of Britain.\r\n\r\nNow Caradwg is, without a doubt, the Caractacus of Roman history, and\r\nthe captivity of his family exactly coincides with the time of St.\r\nPaul’s first journey to Rome. Moreover, as has been already shown under\r\nthe head of Aristobulus, there is great reason to consider that\r\nAristobulus, the friend of St. Paul, was the same as the Arwystli, whom\r\nthe _Triads_ commemorate as among their first missionaries. A farm-house\r\nin Glamorganshire, called Trevran, house of Bran, is pointed out as the\r\nplace where Bran used to reside, and it is near Llanilid, which is\r\nconsidered as the oldest church in Britain.\r\n\r\nSuch is the British account of the father of Caradwg. The Roman account\r\nis, that Cunobelinus was king of the Silures, and husband of\r\nCartismandua, queen of the Brigantes, and was a prosperous and powerful\r\nprince in league with the Romans.\r\n\r\nCunobelinus is in like manner a title, though not of man. Cûn is, as\r\nwill be shown in due time, a chief or lord. Bel or Belin was the Keltic\r\ngod of light and of war, in whose honour British coins were struck in\r\nthe heathen days of Bran, whose own name the Romans thought they were\r\nreading on his coins. Beli also meant war, and more than one king was\r\ncalled from him.\r\n\r\nBran the Blessed may thus be our old friend Cymbeline, a name repeated\r\nin Cornwall, but from literature, not tradition. Cartismandua, or\r\nAregwydd, is the wicked queen, and Caradwg one of the sons.\r\n\r\nAs to Imogen, the real charm of the play, no British lady either\r\naccounts for or explains her name; but in German genealogies we fall\r\nupon Imagina of Limburg, in 1400; and there are various other instances\r\nof the like, so that Shakespeare may be supposed to have heard of one of\r\nthem, and adopted her as the heroine of the old story of the deserted\r\nand betrayed wife, which he so strangely placed at the court of the last\r\nindependent British prince. Or Imogen may be a Shakespearian version of\r\nYgnoge, daughter of Pandrasus, emperor of Greece, and wife of Brutus,\r\naccording to Geoffrey of Monmouth. In Anne of Brittany’s funeral\r\noration, in 1514, her birth was deduced from this last.\r\n\r\nCaradwg’s own proper name comes from the same root as the Greek χάρις,\r\ngrace, and the Latin _carus_, dear. It means beloved, and has the Breton\r\nform Keridak. Caer Caradoc, in Shropshire, retains the name of his camp.\r\nHe had a worthy namesake in Caradawc Vreichfras, or strong armed, called\r\nthe pillar of the Kymry, and one of the three battle knights of Britain.\r\nVreichfras means the strong arm, but the French trouveurs rendered it\r\nBrise-bras, the wasted arm; and told of an enchanter who fixed a serpent\r\non the knight’s arm, from whose torture nothing could relieve him but\r\nthat she whom he loved best should undergo it in his stead. His faithful\r\nwife offered herself; the serpent was just about to seize on her, when\r\nher brother smote off its head with his sword; but her husband thus\r\nnever recovered the strength of his arm! Others, however, read\r\nVreich-fras as _Fer-a-bras_, iron arm; and thus, perhaps, from some\r\nBreton romance, was one of the Hauteville brothers called William\r\nFerabras. Hence, again, did the French and Italian romancers name their\r\nfierce Moorish champion Ferraù, or Ferragus, the same who lost his\r\nhelmet, and possessed the healing salve, valued by Don Quixote as the\r\nbalsam of Fierabras!\r\n\r\nCaradwg’s wife, Tegan Euvron, or golden beauty, was mentioned by the\r\n_Triads_ as one of the three fair ladies and chaste damsels of Arthur’s\r\ncourt, possessing three precious things, of which she alone was\r\nworthy,—the mantle, the goblet, and the knife. Later romance and ballad\r\nhave expanded these into the story of the three tests of the faithful\r\nwife; and Sir Caradoc and his lady remain among the prime worthies of\r\nthe Round Table.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century a saint named Caradwg retired from the world in\r\ndisgust at the violence shown to him by his master, Rhys, prince of\r\nSouth Wales, on learning the loss of two greyhounds that had been in\r\nCaradwg’s charge. He lived in various hermitages in Wales and left a\r\nwell in the parish of Haroldstone, called by his name. Moreover, soon\r\nafter his death, he was said to have suddenly closed his hand, in\r\nfrustration of the designs of the historian, William of Malmsbury, who\r\nwanted to cut off his little finger for a relic. Our insular saints were\r\ndecidedly of Shakespeare’s opinion, and had no desire to have their\r\n‘bones moved’ or be made relics of.\r\n\r\nCaradwg, Caradoc, and Keriadek continue to be used in Wales, Scotland,\r\nand Brittany.\r\n\r\n_Cara_, friend, was sometimes prefixed to a saint’s name by the\r\nChristian Gael, as Cara Michil, friend of St. Michael, as the name of\r\nhis devout client, and thus arose such surnames as Carmichael.\r\n\r\nThis pursuit of Cymbeline and his family has carried us far from Bran\r\nthe Blessed. Under this, his proper name, he stands forth in old Welsh,\r\nromance as the original importer of the Sanc-greal. One very old and\r\nwild version says that King Bran brought from Ireland a magic vessel,\r\ngiven him by a great black man in Ireland, which healed wounds and\r\nraised the dead.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century the Sanc-greal had assumed its Christian\r\ncharacter, and Bran the Blessed, as the first Christian prince of\r\nBritain, was said to have received it from St. Joseph of Arimathea, and\r\nguarded it to the end of his life. No wonder, therefore, that Brittany\r\nloved and honoured his name.\r\n\r\nBran was a Pictish prince, killed in 839, in battle with the Danes, and\r\nit is highly probable that St. Birinus, the Keltic apostle of Wessex,\r\nwas another form of Bran.\r\n\r\nBrian has been from very old times a favourite Christian name in both\r\nBrittany and Ireland, the first no doubt from the Christian honours of\r\nthe blessed Bran, the second from the source whence he was named.\r\n\r\nThe great glory of Brian in Ireland was in the renowned Brian Boromhe,\r\nKing of Leinster, or of the tribute, so called from the tribute, once\r\nshaken off by Ulster, but which he re-imposed. He defeated the Danes in\r\ntwenty-five battles, and finally was slain in the great battle of\r\nClontarf, on the Good Friday of 1014. Around that battle has centered a\r\nwonderful amount of fine legendary poetry on both sides.\r\n\r\nBrian, or Bryan, is a very frequent Christian name, but according to the\r\nusual lot of its congeners, has an equivalent, _i. e._ Bernard, chiefly\r\nin Ulster, with which it has not the most distant connection.\r\n\r\nBrien was always a favourite in Brittany, and is very common as a\r\nsurname with the peasantry there. The Bretons, who joined in the Norman\r\nconquest, imported it to England. Two landholders, so called, are\r\nrecorded in Domesday Book; and during the first century of Norman rule\r\nit was far more common than at present, when it is considered as almost\r\nexclusively Irish. Some of our older etymologists have been beguiled\r\ninto deriving it from the French _bruyant_, noisy.\r\n\r\nThe feminine Brennone is given in German dictionaries, but it, as well\r\nas Brennus, are there derived from old German, and explained as\r\nprotection, which is clearly a mistake.\r\n\r\nBrieuc was a Breton saint; Breasal was once common in Ireland, and\r\nsurvives in a few families, but is generally turned into Basil, and\r\nsometimes to Brazil, in which shape the Manxmen frequently bore it.\r\n\r\n_Brîgh_ or strength, is the most satisfactory explanation of Brighid,\r\nthe daughter of the fire-god, and the goddess of wisdom and song, skill\r\nand poetry.\r\n\r\nCormac, king and bishop of Cashel, explains the word as a ‘fiery dart;’\r\nbut this looks like one of the many late and untrustworthy\r\ninterpretations of Keltic names.\r\n\r\nBrighid was always a favourite female name in Ireland, and has become\r\none of the very few Keltic ones of European popularity. This was owing\r\nto a maiden who was brought up by a bard, and afterwards became a pupil\r\nof St. Patrick; and from a solitary recluse at Kildare, rose to be the\r\nhead of five hundred nuns, and was consulted by the synod of bishops.\r\nShe died in 510, and after her death, a copy of the Gospels was found in\r\nher cell, too beautiful to have been written by mortal hand, “with\r\nmystical pictures in the margent, whose colours and workmanship were, at\r\nfirst blush, dark and unpleasant, but in the view marvellously lively\r\nand artificiall.”\r\n\r\nIt was long kept at Kildare, and a little hand-bell, such as was much\r\nused by the Irish missionaries, and which had belonged to her, and was,\r\ntherefore, called Clogg Brighde, or Bridget’s Bell, was exhibited to the\r\ndevout, in both England and Ireland, until it was suppressed by a\r\nprohibition from Henry V., perhaps, because it tended to keep up a\r\nnational spirit.\r\n\r\nShe was one of the patron saints of Ireland, and was regarded with such\r\ndevotion, both there and in Scotland, that children were baptized as her\r\nservants, Maol Brighde, Giollabrid; and to the present day, hers is the\r\nfavourite name in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSt. Bride’s churches are common, both in England and Scotland, and the\r\nvillage of Llanaffraid, in Wales, records her in her Welsh form of\r\nFfraid. Bridewell was once the palace of St. Bride, and after its\r\nconversion into a prison, spread its sinister name to other like\r\nbuildings. The Portuguese believe themselves to possess the head of St.\r\nBridget at Lisbon, and have accordingly more than one Doña Brites among\r\ntheir historical ladies.\r\n\r\nSweden has also a St. Bridget, or rather Brigitta; but her name is in\r\nher own tongue Bergljot, shortened to Berglit, and then confounded with\r\nthe Irish Bridget. It unfortunately means mountain-fright, or guardian\r\ndefect, though German antiquaries have twisted both Bridgets into\r\n_Beraht Gifu_, bright gift. Be that as it may, the Swedish Brigitta was\r\na lady of very high birth, who, in her widowhood, founded an order of\r\nBrigittin nuns, somewhere about 1363, made a pilgrimage to Rome, and was\r\ngreatly revered for her sanctity. She named the very large class of\r\nNorwegian, German, and Swedish Bridgets or Berets, who are almost as\r\nnumerous as the Irish.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Irish.     │    Scotch.    │    French.    │\r\n   │Bridget        │Brighid        │     Bride     │Brigitta       │\r\n   │Bride          │Biddy          │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │  Portuguese.  │   Swedish.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Brigida        │Brites         │Brigitta       │Brigitta       │\r\n   │Brigita        │               │Brita          │  ——————————   │\r\n   │               │               │Begga          │     Esth.     │\r\n   │               │               │Bergliot       │Pirrit         │\r\n   │               │               │Beret          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │   Lettish.    │     Lith.     │     Lapp.     │\r\n   │Brischia       │Britte         │Berge          │Pirket         │\r\n   │Brischa        │Birte          │Berzske        │Pikka          │\r\n   │               │Pirre          │               │Pikke          │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION IV.—_Fear, Gwr, Vir._\r\n\r\nThe free days of the Kelt were fast ending. He fell before Roman\r\ndiscipline, though not without a worthy struggle.\r\n\r\nIn Cisalpine Gaul, Marcellus and Scipio themselves found Britomartus, or\r\nViridomarus, king of the Boii, so worthy an antagonist that Marcellus,\r\nhaving slain him in single fight, dedicated his _spolia opima_ in the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Feretrius. In Spain, a Lusitanian hunter or shepherd,\r\nnamed Viriathus, carried on a guerilla warfare with the Roman legions\r\nfor fourteen years. In Gaul, Cæsar mentions Virdumarus among his allies\r\nthe Æduans, and says that their chief magistrate was termed\r\n_vergobretus_, and among his enemies, the Unelli and Arverni, he records\r\nViridovix, Vergosillanus, and Vercingetorix.\r\n\r\nThe last chieftain was one of the most gallant men who struggled in vain\r\nagainst the eagles.\r\n\r\nHowever, our concern is chiefly with his name. In fact, these _Virs_ of\r\nCæsar might have been placed in our preceding division, for they are\r\nfrom the same root, _bri_, or force, and still more resemble the\r\nSanscrit _virja_, as well as the Latin _virtus_ and _vir_. Exactly\r\nanswering to _vir_, though coming in an independent stream from the same\r\nsource, the Gaelic man is _fear_, plural _fir_; the Cymric is _gwr_,\r\ngen. _gyr_, plural _wyr_. Again, valour or virtue is in Welsh _gwyrth_,\r\nand _gwr_ is the adjective for excelling.\r\n\r\nThus there can be no reasonable doubt, that the _ver_ or _vir_ of the\r\nLatin version of these Keltic heroes was a rendering of the _fear_ of\r\nthe Gael, or of the _gwr_ of the Cymry, both not infrequent\r\ncommencements; and the double name of the hero of Cisalpine Gaul,\r\nViridomarus, or Britomartus, brings us back to the original root. It may\r\nbe that Britomartus referred to his great strength.\r\n\r\nVergobretus, the magistrate of the Ædui, is explained either as\r\n_Fear-co-breith_, man who judges, or _War-cy-fraith_, man placed over\r\nthe laws; or, taking _gwr_ as excelling, and _brawd_, as justice, he\r\nwould be excelling in justice.\r\n\r\nViriathus must be referred to _fear_, man, and, perhaps, to _aodh_,\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nVercingetorix himself may be translated into _Fear-cuin-cedo-righ_, man\r\nwho is chief of a hundred heads; and his cousin, Vergosillanus, is the\r\nman either of the banner or the spear, according as _sillanus_ is\r\nreferred to _saighean_, a banner, or to _saelan_, a spear.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are the tokens of kindred between the Gauls of the continent\r\nand the Gael of our islands, for _Fear_, the frequent commencement in\r\nboth Ireland and Scotland, is assuredly the word that Cæsar rendered by\r\n_Vir_, more correctly both in sense and sound than he knew.\r\n\r\nFearghus, man-deed, from _gus_, a deed, is the rendering of one of the\r\nmost national of Gaelic names, though Macpherson makes it Fearguth, man\r\nof the word.\r\n\r\nBold genealogists place Feargus at the head of the line of Scottish\r\nkings, and make him contemporary with Alexander the Great. Another\r\nFergus was son of Finn, and considered as even a greater bard than his\r\nnephew, Oisean. Poems said to be by him are still extant, in one of\r\nwhich he describes his rescue of his brother, Oisean, who had been\r\nbeguiled into a fairy cave, and there imprisoned, till he discovered\r\nhimself to his brother by cutting splinters from his spear, and letting\r\nthem float down the stream that flowed out of the place of his\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nFearghus, the son of Erc, a Dalriad prince, was, in 493, blessed by St.\r\nPatrick, and led the great migration of Scots to Albin, together with\r\nhis brothers Loarn and Aonnghus, who each named their own district,\r\nwhile he reigned over the whole region of the Scots,—that around Argyle;\r\nwhither he had transported the stone of dominion, that sooner or later\r\nbrought conquest to the race who possessed it. From these Fearghus or\r\nFarghy in Ireland, Fergus in Scotland, and the feminine Fergusiana still\r\ncontinue in use.\r\n\r\nFearachar is another Scottish form. Ferquard is given as prince of the\r\nScots in Ireland, at some incalculable time; and Fearchur or Ferchar was\r\nthe king of the Scots just after St. Columbus' death. He is Latinized as\r\nFerquardus; and this was the name of an Earl of Ross in 1231; and as\r\nFarquhar has continued in favour in the Highlands. Feardorcha is the\r\nblind man. Fardorougha is an incorrect modernism, and Ferdinand and\r\nFrederick the supposed equivalent.\r\n\r\n_Gwr_, or _Wr_, is the Cymric form of the same word, and the parallel to\r\nFergus among the Picts was Wrguist, or Urguist, a prince who lived about\r\n800, and whose daughter was called after him, married the Scottish Eacha\r\nor Fergusiana, and thus led to the union of the two races under her\r\ndescendant, Kenneth MacAlpin.\r\n\r\nGwrtigearn, excelling king, is a Silurian prince of doubtful fame.\r\nThrough Latinism we know him as Vortigern. It would seem that when the\r\nusurpation of Maximus had involved the Roman empire in confusion, and\r\nleft Britain without any legions to defend it against the robber nations\r\nround, that he made some attempt at a partial revival of national\r\nspirit; but, failing this, entered into a treaty with the Anglo-Saxon\r\ninvaders, and was thought to have betrayed the cause of his country.\r\n\r\nWhat these doings were is another matter. We all know the romantic\r\nhistory of Vortigern’s letter to Henghist and Horsa; of his visit to the\r\nSaxon camp; of Rowena and her cup; of the Isle of Thanet marked out by\r\nstrips of cow-hide; and of the treachery of the Saxons at Stonehenge.\r\nThere is nothing morally impossible in the story as it was dished up for\r\nmodern history, and it used to satisfy our ancestors before they had\r\nfound out that a small king on the Welsh border could hardly have dealt\r\nwith Thanet, and, moreover, that the Teutonic immigration had been going\r\non for many years past on the eastern coast.\r\n\r\nAs to the cow-hide and the massacre, they are said to be old Thuringian\r\ntraditions; and the Welsh seem to have either invented or preserved the\r\nstory of the fascinations of Rowena. At any rate, they named her; for,\r\nalas for Saxon Rowena, there is nothing Teutonic in the word, and the\r\nKymric form _Rhonwen_, white skirt, betrays its origin. Rhonwen, or\r\nBradwen, is the name by which she is called in the _Gododin_, a poem\r\nascribed to the bard Aneurin, and, perhaps, containing some germs of\r\ntruth, though its connection with the Stonehenge massacre is hotly\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                             GAELIC NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION I.—_Scottish Colonists._\r\n\r\nThe strange and wild beliefs that prevailed regarding the original\r\nsettlement of ancient Ireland, have left strong traces on the names\r\nstill borne by the population, both there and in Scotland.\r\n\r\nWe need not go back quite to Adam’s great-grandson, and the wicked race\r\nthat sprang from him, and all perished, except one giant, who took up\r\nhis abode in a cave, and there lived till he was baptized by St.\r\nPatrick; nor to Fintan, who was changed into a salmon during the time\r\nthat the flood prevailed, and afterwards gave rise to the proverb, “I\r\ncould tell you many things were I as old as Fintan.” A bard, so called,\r\nwas said to have existed, and a poem is attributed to him, which gives a\r\nvery queer account of the first settlers, though he does not there claim\r\nquite such a startling experience.\r\n\r\nFomorians, Fir Bolg, men dwelling in caves, or, more probably, ravaging\r\nmen, and Tuath De Danan, _i.e._ chiefs, priests, and bards, are all\r\nconducted in turn to Erin by tradition and poetry; but none equal in\r\nfame or interest the tribe called Milesian, from whom the purest Irish\r\nblood is supposed to descend.\r\n\r\nThe favourite legends start this famous colony from the East, where\r\nPhenius, the head of the family, was supposed to have taught the\r\nPhœnicians letters, and left them his name! His son, Niul, not to be\r\nbehindhand with him, named the Nile, having been sent on an embassy to\r\nEgypt, where he married Pharaoh’s daughter! Whether her name was Scota\r\nor not, authorities are not agreed; but all declare that it was her\r\nfather who was drowned in the Red Sea, and that a subsequent dispute\r\nwith the Egyptians caused either Niul or his son to migrate to Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is this Niul, or Niale, to whom the whole legion of Niales are to be\r\nreferred. The name, from _niadh_, means a champion, and was probably\r\ncarried backwards to the ancestor from the various Neills, who thought\r\nthey might as well claim the Nile as their namesake.\r\n\r\nNeill of the Nine Hostages, was one of the greatest of the ancient\r\nheroes; he was the last but one of the pagan kings of Ireland, and\r\nhimself most unconsciously imported the seed of the Gospel, for it was\r\nhis men who, in a piratical descent on the Roman colony of Valentia,\r\ncarried off the boy who, in after days, was to become the Apostle of\r\nIreland,—one of the many slaves by whom the Gospel has been extended.\r\nNeill of the Nine Hostages was killed by an assassin about the year 405;\r\nbut his family, the Hy Neill, or children of Neill, became one of the\r\nleading septs in the North of Ireland. Of them the story is told, that\r\non going to settle on the Ulster coast, one of them resolved to take\r\nseisin of the new country by touching the shore before any one else, and\r\nfinding his boat outstripped, he tore out his dagger, cut off his right\r\nhand at the wist, and threw it on the beach, so that his fingers were\r\nthe first laid on the domain. Such, at least, is the tale that accounts\r\nfor the O'Neill’s war-cry, _Lamhdearg Aboo_ (Red hand set on), and for\r\nthe red hand on the shield of the O'Neills and of Ulster, afterwards\r\ngiven by James I. to the knights baronets, whom he created as\r\n‘undertakers’ of the new colony of English, which he wished to found in\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nIreland thus frequently used Neill, or Niall, and Scotland Niel, as it\r\nis there spelt, but it is far more surprising to meet with it among the\r\nScandinavian races. It is evidence that there must have been some\r\nconsiderable intercourse between Ireland and the North before the days\r\nof the piracies of the historical ages. The old Irish legends constantly\r\nspeak of Norway as Lochlinn, or the land of lakes, and show visits\r\ntaking place between the inhabitants; and there are names to be found in\r\nboth countries, borrowed from one another, too far back to be ascribed\r\nto the Norse invasions.\r\n\r\nIn the _Landnama Bok_, the Domesday Book of Iceland, no less than three\r\nNjals appear, and the Njalssaga, the history of the noble-spirited yet\r\npeaceful Icelander, who, even in the tenth century, had never shed\r\nblood, and preferred rather to die with his sons than to live to avenge\r\nthem, is one of the finest histories that have come down to us from any\r\nage. Njal’s likeness to the contraction Nils, has caused many to suppose\r\nthat it also is a form of Nicolas, but the existence of Nial both in\r\nIreland and Iceland before the conversion of either country contradicts\r\nthis. Nielsen is a frequent Northern patronymic, and our renowned name\r\nof Nelson probably came to us through Danish settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Northmen apparently took their Njal to France with them, and it\r\nthere was called Nesle or Nêle. Chroniclers Latinized it as Nigellus,\r\nsupposing it to mean black; and in Domesday book, twelve landholders\r\ncalled Nigellus appear, both before and after the Conquest, so that they\r\nmay be supposed to be Danish Niels, left undisturbed in their\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nNigel de Albini, brother to him who married the widow of Henry I., must\r\nhave been a genuine Norman Niel; and through the numerous Anglo-Norman\r\nnobles who were adopted into the Scottish peerage, this form was adopted\r\nin addition to the old Gaelic Nial, or as a translation of it, for the\r\nyoung brother of Robert Bruce is called by both names, Nigel and Nial.\r\nAt present this Latinized Normanism of the old Keltic word is considered\r\nas peculiarly Scottish, chiefly because it has been kept up in that form\r\nin old Scotch families.\r\n\r\nFergus, Loarn, and Aonghus are said to have been the three brothers who\r\nled the migration from Erin to Caledonia, and transferred the name of\r\nScotland from one isle to the other in 503, and Loarn and Angus gave\r\ntheir names to two districts in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAnguss was indeed a popular name both in Scotland and Ireland. It comes\r\nfrom the numeral _aon_, one; it also conveys the sense of pre-eminence,\r\nmeans excellent strength, and it is generally pronounced Haoonish in\r\nGaelic. Irish genealogists make Aongus Turimheach king two hundred and\r\nthirty-three years before the Christian era; and we are afterwards told\r\nof another Aongas, king of Munster, who had a family of forty-eight sons\r\nand daughters, of whom he gave half to St. Patrick to be monks and nuns.\r\nIn Hanmer’s _Chronicle_, King Arthur visits Ireland and converses with\r\nKing Anguish, which painful title is precisely that which Henry VIII.,\r\nin his correspondence, gives his brother-in-law, the Earl of Angus.\r\n\r\nAngus is specially at home in Scotland, but there it has been called\r\nHungus and Ungus, likewise Enos, and is now generally translated into\r\nÆneas, the christened name of many a Scot who ought to be Angus; and the\r\nIrish are too apt to change it in the same way.[97]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  Hanmer, _Chronicle_; _Ossianic Society’s Transactions_; Taylor, _Hist.\r\n  of Ireland_; Dasent, _Nialsaga_; _Highland Society’s Dictionary_;\r\n  Ellis, _Domesday Book_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION II.—_The Feen._\r\n\r\nA remarkable cycle of traditions are cherished by the Gaelic race\r\nregarding a band of heroes, whom they call the Fiann, or Fenians, and\r\nwhose exploits are to them what those of Jason, or Theseus, were to the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nScotland and Ireland claim them both alike, and point to places named\r\nafter them and their deeds; but the balance of probability is in favour\r\nof Ireland, as their chief scene of adventure, although they may also\r\nhave spent some time in Morven, as their legends call the West of\r\nScotland, since the Gaelic race was resident in both countries, and kept\r\ntogether in comparative union by its hatred to the Cymry in both. This\r\nsupposition is confirmed by the semblance of a date that is supplied\r\nthrough the conversion of the last survivor of the band by St. Patrick,\r\nwhich would place their era in the end of the fourth century, just when\r\nthe migrations of the Scots were taking place, supposing these to have\r\nlasted from about A.D. 250 to 500. Still, the Fian may be only one of\r\nthe ancient imaginations of the Gael, and either never have had any\r\ncorporeal existence at all, or else, genuine ancient myths may have\r\nfixed themselves upon some forefathers, who under their influence have\r\nbeen magnified into heroic—not to say gigantic—proportions.\r\n\r\nThese tales, songs, and poems lived among the story-telling Highlanders\r\nand Irish, unnoticed, until the eighteenth century, when the Scottish\r\nauthor, James Macpherson, perceived that they contained a mine of wild\r\nbeauty and heroic deeds, and were, in fact, the genuine national poetry\r\nof his race.\r\n\r\nHe put his fragments together into the books of an epic, and wrought up\r\nthe measured metre of the Gaelic into a sort of stilted English prose,\r\nrhythmical, and not without a certain grandeur of cadence and\r\nexpression; moreover, he left out a good deal of savagery, triviality,\r\nrepetition, and absurdity; and produced an exceedingly striking book, by\r\nexpanding the really grand imagery of the ancient bards, and, perhaps,\r\nunconsciously imparting Christian heroism to his characters.\r\n\r\nThere had been some unscrupulousness from the first. Either from\r\nnationality or ignorance, Macpherson had entirely ignored the connection\r\nwith St. Patrick, and made his heroes altogether Scottish, though\r\npassing into Ireland; and when a swarm of critics arose, some\r\nquestioning, some mocking, he did not make a candid statement of what\r\nwere his materials, but left the world to divide itself between the\r\nbeliefs that the whole was Ossian’s, or the whole Macpherson’s. Had he\r\nbeen truthful, he would have gained high credit, both as poet and\r\nantiquary; but he brought on himself the reputation of an impostor, his\r\nliterary talents have been forgotten, and the poems themselves are far\r\nless regarded than they deserve.\r\n\r\nBe the truth what it may, the names of the Fianna were in constant use\r\nlong before Macpherson was heard of.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland and West Scotland, the early poems represent Finn and his\r\nfriends performing high feats of prowess.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Feen either invaded Ireland, or became obnoxious to the\r\nnatives, and were set upon at the battle of Garristown, or Gabhra,\r\npronounced Gavra, loud shouting. The last survivor of them was the poet\r\nOisean, or Ossian, as he is now called, who was said to have lived till\r\nthe coming of St. Patrick, and to have been taken into his monastery,\r\nwhere old Irish poems show him in most piteous case, complaining much of\r\nfasts, and of the “drowsy sound of a bell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION III.—_Finn._\r\n\r\nLeader of the Fianna, and bestowing on them their very title, stands the\r\ngreat Fion, the grand centre of ancient Gaelic giant lore; his full\r\ntitle being Fionn Mac Cumhail, pronounced Coul. Fingal, the name the\r\nScots have known him by ever since the time of Barbour, is really a\r\nconfusion of Faingall, the toilers of the Gaul.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt of the meaning of _fion_. It is the same with the\r\nCymric Gwynn, or Wynn, and like them signifies white, fair, or clear, as\r\nin the name of Lough Fyne.\r\n\r\nOne very remarkable feature in the history of Finn is that the same\r\nmeaning of white attaches to it in ancient or poetical Scandinavian,\r\nthough not in the other Teutonic languages; nor is the name found in any\r\nTeuton nation but the northern ones, except that in the Saxon chronicle,\r\nFinn is Odin’s fourth forefather, whereas he is his grandfather in the\r\n_Edda_.\r\n\r\nIn the great Anglian poem of _Beowolf_, Finn is king of the Frisians,\r\nbut is conquered by the Danes, strangely enough, under Henghist; another\r\npoem, called the _Battle of Finnsburh_, records the strife—Finn lost\r\nhalf his kingdom, but the next year he killed Henghist; then being set\r\nupon by the other Danes, lost his crown and life. It is likely that, old\r\nas the poem is, it has been much altered, and that it really existed\r\nbefore the Anglian colonization of our island; indeed, there is reason\r\nto suppose that it was in memory of the burgh of this Frisian Finn, that\r\nFinsbury manor in the city of London acquired its name.\r\n\r\nFinn is a giant in Norway, compelled by the good Bishop Laurence to\r\nerect the church at Lund, after which he was turned into stone by way of\r\npayment, wife, child, and all, as may still be seen. Again in Denmark as\r\na trolld, he did the same service for Esbern Snare, building Kallundborg\r\nchurch, on condition that if his name was not guessed by the time the\r\nchurch was finished, his employer should become his property. As in the\r\nGerman tale of _Rumpel Stitzchen_, the danger was averted by the victim,\r\njust in time, overhearing this amiable lullaby in the hole of a rock—\r\n\r\n           “Be still, my babe, be still,\r\n           To-morrow comes thy father Finn,\r\n           Esbern’s heart and eyes for a toy thou shalt win.”\r\n\r\nNext morning Esbern saluted Finn by his name, as he was bringing the\r\nlast half-pillar, whereupon he flew away, pillar and all, wherefore the\r\nchurch only stands to this day on three pillars and a half!\r\n\r\nFinn alone, and in combination, is rather a favourite in the North. The\r\n_Landnama-bok_, which gives the Icelandic genealogies from the\r\nsettlements there in the ninth century down to the middle of the\r\nthirteenth, has five men named Finnr, two, Finni, and three ladies\r\ncalled Finna; and in the three countries in the, mainland it has been\r\nequally common, even to comparatively recent times, when Finn Magnusson\r\nwas one of the chief authorities for Scandinavian antiquities. Among the\r\ncompounds of the name, the Swedes have Finngaard, which their\r\npronunciation contrives to make sound like Fingal, with what is called\r\nthe “thick _l_;” and in modern times it is so spelt in allusion to\r\nMacpherson’s hero. The name Finnketyl, or Finnkjell, with the feminine\r\nFinnkatla, is explained as the cauldron or vessel of some semi-divine\r\nFinn. Kettles are rather common in the North, but almost always belong\r\nto some divinity of high rank. Finn has his weapons, as Finnbogi, or\r\nFinbo, a white bow; Finngeir, a white spear; his sport, as Finleik,\r\nwhite game or reward; his forest, as Finnvidr, or white wood; as well as\r\nhis guardianship, as Finn-vardr, or white ward, all represented in\r\nnorthern nomenclature, in a manner analogous to those of the national\r\ndeities.\r\n\r\nAll this makes it highly probable that Finn was an idea borrowed from\r\nthe Gael by the Norsemen, especially as the hammer of Thor is sometimes\r\nto be heard in Scottish legend resounding in the hand of Finn. Fionn is\r\nstill a name in Ireland, but in English is translated into Albany; and\r\nin Scotland Fionnlaoch, white soldier, has become Finlay.\r\n\r\nThere are many other Keltic names connected with Finn in the sense of\r\nwhite, such as Finghin, or the fair offspring, which became Finian or\r\nFineen; and as such was the name of two saints, one a friend of St.\r\nPatrick, and that teacher of St. Columb, who, when Columb had written\r\nout the Psalms from a book lent by him, claimed the copy on the plea\r\nthat it was the offspring of his manuscript. Nevertheless, St. Columb\r\ntook care that St. Finan should be duly revered in Scotland, where he\r\nhas various churches, and one royal namesake, for probably he was the\r\nreal original of the Finnan, whose reign is placed B.C. 134. Another St.\r\nFinghin is patron of Ulster, and left his name to be a favourite in the\r\nfamilies of M'Carthy, O'Sullivan, and O'Driscoll, until Finghin M'Carthy\r\nAnglicized himself as Florence, in which he has ever since been imitated\r\nby his countrymen, though the change did not bring him much good\r\nfortune, as his enemies represented that his alias showed sinister\r\nintentions; and for other more definite misdeeds, he was thirty-six\r\nyears imprisoned in the Tower of London. It was a mistake in Lady Morgan\r\nto make Florence M'Carthy a woman, for Florence and Flory in Ireland\r\nwere always men. We do find a Florence mentioned as contemporary with\r\nSt. Patrick; but this is doubtless meant as a translation of Finghin.\r\n\r\nThe ladies, however, have not been behindhand in spoiling their\r\nderivative from Fionn. Fionn-ghuala, or white shoulder, was a\r\ntough-looking name enough, though no one need complain of it as\r\nFinnuala, as it actually is spoken, still less as Fenella. Early Keltic\r\nmaidens used it frequently, and it is found in all manner of shapes in\r\ngenealogies. In the clouds at the opening of Scottish history, we find\r\nFynbella, or Finella, recorded as the cruel Lady of Fettercairn, who, in\r\n994, killed King Kenneth III.\r\n\r\nAnother Fynbella was Lady of the Mearns in 1174; Finvola is found in the\r\nM'Leod pedigree twice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The\r\nMacdonnells called her Finwald in 1497. Finvola and Finola thickly stud\r\nthe Irish pedigrees; and it was perfectly correct in Scott to make\r\nFenella the name of the little wild dumb sprite, whom he placed in the\r\nIsle of Man as a daughter of the house of Christian. In almost all its\r\noriginal homes, however, Fenella has been discarded, having been ousted\r\nby its supposed equivalent, Penelope (a weaver), and only in a few Irish\r\nfamilies is it still retained, and then in the form of Nuala. In\r\nScotland it has turned into the well-known Flora or Florie.\r\n\r\nThe other feminine forms of Finn have entirely passed away. They were\r\nFinbil and Finscoth, white blossom and white flower, answering to the\r\nBlanche-fleur of Romance, which it is possible was really meant as a\r\ntranslation; Findelvh, fair countenance; Finnabhor, of the fair eyelids;\r\nFinni, the fair; and Findath, fair colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION IV.—_Cu, Cun, Gal._\r\n\r\nWe have treated the name of Fionn alone, because that is, comparatively,\r\nplain sailing, while the second syllable of the name by which we call\r\nhim is beset with interminable perplexities.\r\n\r\nIf he was only Fingal, it would be easy enough to translate him by\r\n‘white courage;’ but unluckily we know that this was a Lowland\r\ncontraction, used indeed in Barbour’s _Bruce_, in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, but not the original form. He was Finn Mac Cumhail; or,\r\naccording to Hector Boece, in 1526, Finn, _filius Cœli_, Finn, the son\r\nof Heaven; thus making him—as every mythic worthy from Hercules to\r\nArthur has been made—an astronomical parable.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it may be observed that Cumhail is in pronunciation\r\nnothing but Coul, or Coyl. That murderous letter _h_ has destroyed the\r\n_m_, and itself into the bargain, and their only use is to testify to\r\nwhat the etymology of the word has been.\r\n\r\nHere we unite with the other branch of the language in a most curious\r\nmanner, for Col, Coel, or Coll, was a highly mythic personage in Kymric\r\nlegend, connected with the original population of Britain.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the three great swineherds of Britain, in the _Triads_, the\r\nother two being Pwll and Tristram; also, he is one of those who\r\nconferred benefits upon Britain, and appears in company with Hu Gadarn.\r\n\r\nThe title of the swineherd is accounted for in the Welsh tale of a sow\r\ncalled Henwen, the old lady, who was placed under his charge, and came\r\nswimming straight for Britain, with Coll holding by her bristles,\r\nwherever she swam. There were predictions that Britain would suffer harm\r\nfrom her progeny, and Arthur therefore collected his forces to oppose\r\nher landing; but at Aber Tarrogi she came to the shore, and at\r\nWheatfield in Gwent she laid three grains of wheat and three bees,\r\nwhence corn and honey are the great pride of the district. At Dyved she\r\nproduced a barleycorn and a pig, to the subsequent benefit of Dyved beer\r\nand bacon. She favoured Lleyn with rye, but on Snowdon she bestowed the\r\nwolf and the eagle, and on Mona a kitten.\r\n\r\nWithout going back, like Mr. Davies, to make the sow either into the\r\nark, or a Phœnician ship, it is worth observing that there are traces in\r\nIreland of some pig myth. There is a famous poem called _The Hunting of\r\nthe Pig_, resulting in its being slain at Muckamore; and _muc_, a pig,\r\nand _torc_, a boar, are constantly found in old names of places, as if\r\nthe swine cult had been of a higher kind than that at present received\r\nby the species.\r\n\r\nNot wholly substantial is the next British Coel-ap-Cyllin, who with Bran\r\nthe Blessed, and his own son Lleurig, makes up a triad of promoters of\r\nChristianity in Britain.\r\n\r\nWe are scarcely sure of more than his existence; not quite that he left\r\nhis name to Colchester, and far less that he is the father of the\r\nEmpress Helena, the mother of Constantine.\r\n\r\nCol or Gall was the name of a companion of St. Columbanus, and, like\r\nhim, one of the great missionary saints of Ireland, who finished the\r\nimperfect work of conversion of the Kelts, scattered in the borders of\r\nFrance, Germany, and Switzerland. His name of St. Gall is still attached\r\nto the great monastery near the Lake of Constance.\r\n\r\nThe prefix _cu_ is, in its primary meaning, a dog, and is thus declined:\r\n_cu_ (nom.), _con_ (gen.), _coin_ (dat.); thus showing its kindred with\r\nthe Sanscrit _çvan_, Greek κυων (cyon), and Latin _canis_, the _chien_\r\nof France, and _cane_ of Italy; _hund_ and _hound_ elsewhere. Only the\r\nland of the magnificent wolf-hound would have made his designation\r\n(elsewhere a term of scorn) into the title of the brave warrior, and\r\nthence into that of a chieftain. And so again it is the Kelts of Britain\r\nthat transmuted the mungoose and snake of the Indian legend into the\r\nfaithful dog and wild wolf of Bedgelert, the grave of the hound. Caleb,\r\nand an occasional Danish Hund, have alone elsewhere endured the name of\r\nthe most faithful of animals; but in Gaelic it is a most favourite\r\nprefix. By the author of the _Annals of Ulster_, it is literally\r\ntranslated _Canis_, making us wonder whether, in the Scala family, Cane,\r\nso famous in Dante’s time, could have been a rendering of some ancient\r\nCeltic Cu.\r\n\r\nConn, when standing alone, as in the case of Conn of the Hundred\r\nBattles, means wisdom.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the most distinguished Fenians have this prefix, and have\r\nhanded it on to a great number of successors. Conghal would seem to have\r\nbeen the proper name of Finn’s father; and, in Macpherson’s poem, a\r\nCongal reigns over Ulster, as many a Congal assuredly did both before\r\nand after his time.\r\n\r\nConnal, or Connel, a name sometimes said to mean friendship, is given to\r\none of the Ossianic heroes, who makes a great figure in Macpherson’s\r\nepic, and is said to have named Tirconnel. The name continued in great\r\nfavour, and the popular tales of the Highlands describe a certain\r\ningenious Conall, whose adventures are a most curious mixture of those\r\nof Ulysses and Sindbad the Sailor, and are related in the same way as\r\nthose of the Three Calenders and other worthies in the _Arabian Nights_.\r\nHistory says that Congal Claen, king of Ulster, slew Suibne, king of\r\nIreland, but was then attacked and defeated by Domnall II., Suibne’s\r\nsuccessor; that he then fled to Donald-brec, or the Freckled, king of\r\nthe Scots, and brought him to Ireland to be defeated at Magrath, in 637.\r\nAn Irish saint, called Congal, founded the Great Abbey of Ben-chor, in\r\nUlster, answering to Ban-chor, in Wales, and thus formed the nursery of\r\nthe great missions of the Irish Church in the sixth century.\r\n\r\nConan of small renown, as Macpherson calls him, was an unfortunate\r\nFenian, who always served as the butt of the rest, and is called in\r\nother legends Conan Maol, the bald. He is in character a good deal like\r\nthe Sir Kay of Arthur’s court. The M'Connans now have borrowed the\r\nEnglish names of Kenyon and Canning. His name comes to light in the\r\nCymric branch, in the person of the British Conan, or Kynan Meriadech,\r\nwho is said to have led a migration of Britons to Armorica, and to be\r\nthe patriarch of the Dukes of Brittany. Of him is told the pretty tale\r\nof the spotless ermine, that took refuge under his shield, and was\r\nspared by him, its skin thenceforth forming the cognizance of Brittany,\r\nwith the motto, _Malò mori quàm fœdari_.\r\n\r\nHe is also said to have been the intended husband of St. Ursula; and, at\r\nany rate, suggested the name of many a Conan among the Breton princes,\r\nuntil the father of the unfortunate Constance, a name very possibly\r\ngiven as a supposed feminine to Conan, since Constantine has devoured\r\nall manner of varieties of _cu_ and _con_, and thus occasions the\r\nnumerous occurrences of this imperial designation as labels to the grim\r\nportraits in the hall at Holyrood, who, after all, look more like Roman\r\nConstantines than Caledonian Congals, Conaires, or Conchobars.\r\n\r\nConnchobhar is also translated as Cornelius and Charles. Here _conn_\r\nmeans strength, and _cobhair_, aid, or if the spelling ought to be\r\nConchobhar, it would be wolf-dog aid, and it is a word as variously\r\nrendered by those who wish to retain its native form as by those who try\r\nto change it into an ordinary name. Macpherson calls it Conachar, and\r\nthence we have the assumed name of the unfortunate young chieftain whom\r\nSir Walter Scott placed in the deadly fight between Clan Chattan and\r\nClan Kay, to exemplify the struggle between constitutional timidity and\r\nfear of shame. Conchabhar, who reigned in Scotland in 847, and Cunechat\r\nor Conquhare, who was Maormar of Angus in the tenth century, are both\r\nforms of Connchobhar, which in the North-East of Ireland is vulgarly\r\ncalled Crogher and Crohoore. The last is said to be the best\r\nrepresentation of the spoken word; but Connor is the usual version, and\r\nmuch the most euphonious to English ears; but then it is said also to\r\nrepresent Connaire, one endowed with strength, _aire_ being a word added\r\nto form an adjective, and Conmor, also in use in the days of the\r\nFenians. Indeed, Ireland had many royal Connors, one dignified as the\r\nGreat; but Conchobar. Conmor, and Connaire, are all confused in them.\r\n\r\nConstantine is used in the Maguire family as a rendering of Cú Connacht,\r\nthe hound of Connaught; Munster’s hound is Cú Mumhan; Cashel’s, Cú\r\nChaisil. The river Shannon has Cú Sionnan; the mountain has Cú-sleibhe;\r\nand, strangest of all, there is Cugan-mathair, hound without a mother.\r\nCú-Mhidhe, hound of Meath, is simply pronounced Cooey; but in the O'Kane\r\nfamily has been turned into Quentin, and it may be concluded that a\r\nsimilar process in Scotland changed the hound of Meath into the Latin\r\nfifth, and accounts for the various Quentins.\r\n\r\nMeath Cuchullin is the name of the hero with which Macpherson’s epic\r\nopens: “Cuchullin sat by Tara’s wall, by the tree of the rustling leaf.”\r\nHis name is explained in the note, to mean, the voice of Ullin or\r\nUlster; Gath Ullin, voice of Ulster; but Ullin does not mean Ulster at\r\nall. It was not the hero’s original name; but when young he killed a\r\nwolf-hound belonging to Culain, the smith of Ulster. He answered the\r\nowner’s complaints by saying, “I will be your hound,” and thus obtained\r\nthe nickname of Cú Culain, Culain’s dog. Cuchullin was a great hero, and\r\na Gaelic proverb, “as strong as Cuchullin,” is still in use. To\r\nCuchullin belongs the Keltic version of the story of the single combat\r\nbetween the unknown father and son, only recognized too late by the\r\ntokens left with the mother. In Persia and Ireland the son is killed; in\r\nGreece, the father; in Germany alone the conclusion is happy!\r\n\r\nAs to the MacCuinns, they have dignified themselves as MacQueen in\r\nScotland, while their cousins in Ireland from O'Cuinn have become Quin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION V.—_Diarmaid and Graine._\r\n\r\nOf all the heroes of the Feen, Diarmaid, whose name means free man, was\r\none of the most distinguished, and though not brought in by Macpherson,\r\nhis legend bears the same sort of relation to the main cycle, as does\r\nthe story of Orlando to the Court of Charlemagne, or that of Lancelot to\r\nthe Round Table.\r\n\r\nGrainne was the daughter of Cormac MacArt, king of the fifth part of\r\nUlster, who built at Tara for her the Grianan of one pillar, or royal\r\npalace. She was a lady of extremely quick wit, and gained the heart of\r\nFionn by her answers to a series of questions, which tradition still\r\npreserves.\r\n\r\nFionn met with the usual fate of uncles in romance, for his nephew,\r\nDiarmaid, fell in love with her too, and was the more irresistible, as\r\nhe had a beauty spot, which made every woman who saw it fall in love\r\nwith him. The young pair fled away together, and there is an extremely\r\nlong poem on their adventures and mutual affection, but fate at length\r\novertook Diarmaid. A great hunting took place, at which all the Feen\r\nwere present; in the course of which they came on the track of a\r\nvenomous boar, whose back was sixteen feet long, and soon after they\r\nfound some shavings of wood made by Diarmaid in cutting out dishes with\r\nhis knife. Having thus discovered his retreat, Fionn summoned his rival,\r\nand commanded him to join in the hunt, in hopes that he would thus meet\r\nhis death; but Diarmaid killed the animal without receiving damage.\r\nFionn then remembered that Diarmaid, like Achilles and Siegfried, had a\r\nfatal spot in his foot, and desired him to measure the boar by pacing it\r\nagainst the hair. One of the bristles went into the fatal spot, and\r\nDiarmaid fell dying; he asked for some water, and Fionn was bringing him\r\nsome from the stream between his hands, when he thought on Grainne, and\r\nlet it run through. Diarmaid died, and his corpse was brought home to\r\nhis wife, whose lamentation is given as a separate poem. Diarmaid was\r\nalso called Doun, the brown, and the clan descended from him were the\r\nO'Duine. The heiress of this line, Aoiffe or Eva, married Gillaspick\r\nCampbell, of an Anglo-Norman family, and Campbell has ever since been\r\nthe Lowland surname of the great clan; but in the North they are still\r\nthe sons of Diarmid; and their crest, the boar’s head, is in memory of\r\nthe fatal hunting.\r\n\r\nDiarmaid continued in use both in Scotland and Ireland; and in\r\nhistorical times it was Diarmaid, king of Leinster, who acted the part\r\nof Paris, and ruined his country by the abduction of Dervorgil of Meath;\r\nand then, when forced by the superior king to give up the lady, revenged\r\nhimself by calling in Earl Strongbow and the English.\r\n\r\nDiarmid, or, as it is commonly called, Dermot or Darby, is still common\r\namong the Irish. Where the saying about Darby and Joan arose, I cannot\r\ndiscover. Darby is the form of Diarmid in Limerick and Tipperary;\r\nJeremiah, strange to say, is used for it in Cork and Kerry. Napoleon, in\r\nhis enthusiasm for the Ossianic poems of Macpherson, named two of his\r\nheroes therefrom, but Diarmaid Murat died in childhood.\r\n\r\nGrainne’s name has been equally popular with that of her lover. Ancient\r\nIrish ladies constantly use it; the most celebrated being Grainne\r\nO'Maille, a notable sailor chieftainess of the south-western coast,\r\nwhence she once sallied forth to pay a friendly visit to Queen\r\nElizabeth; and when the two high-spirited women were together, the\r\nsemi-barbarian was more than a match for the civilized queen.\r\n\r\nGraine was soon after translated into Grace; indeed, the piratess was\r\nalso called Grace O'Malley; and ever since, Grace has been a favourite\r\nnational name in Scotland and Ireland, wherever Graine has been used; it\r\nhas been accepted for its English meaning and pleasant sound, and is now\r\nvery frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VI.—_Cormac._\r\n\r\nCormac is a name that makes a great figure in the Ossianic poems, and\r\nperhaps the son of _Corb_, _i. e._, a chariot, that is, a charioteer.\r\nCormac, king of Ulster, was the young ward of Cuchullin; and another\r\nCormac, called Cairbar, or the strong, was the father of a lady called\r\nMorna, or more properly, Muirne, who when one lover returned from\r\nbattle, announcing that he had slain his rival, demanded his sword\r\nstained with the blood, and then took revenge by plunging it into his\r\nbreast, and finally killed herself with it. A still more misty Cormac\r\nfigures in ancient pedigrees, as having been choked by the bone of an\r\nenchanted salmon; and Cormac Cas is a more remote ancestor of the\r\nO'Briens than the great Brien Boromhe himself.\r\n\r\nAnother Cormac is named in Irish calendars, as an abbot of eminent\r\nsanctity in the days of St. Columba. He is further thought to have\r\nvisited Iona, and at home enjoys the credit of having endowed the sept\r\nof the Hy Muireadach with “prosperity of cattle, the gift of eloquence,\r\nsuccess in fosterage, the gift of good counsel, and the headship of\r\npeace and protection.” His name has since been common in Ireland.\r\n\r\nCormac used to be barbarously spelt Cormick and Cormuck, and the\r\nMacCarthy family have substituted Charles for it. There is a long\r\nIcelandic poem on a hero named Kormak, who, though his parents and\r\nbrothers have Norse names, evidently had Milesian blood as well as name,\r\nfor he is described as having dark eyes and hair, with a fair skin. He\r\nwas an admirable warrior and poet, but was the victim of hopeless love\r\nfor a lady named Steingerda.\r\n\r\nCairbre, strong man, is likewise one of the Ossianic names, as well as a\r\nsoubriquet of Cormac. Cairbre again is reckoned as the first of the\r\nMilesians to settle in Ulster; and another Cairbre, son of Niall of the\r\nNine Hostages, bequeathed his name to the district now called Carbury.\r\n\r\nCairbre appears as the Irish sovereign who was the greatest foe of the\r\nFenians, and commanded at the battle of Gabhra, in which their force was\r\nbroken; and the son of Oisean, the grandson of Fionn, the beloved Osgar,\r\nwas treacherously slain, by a thrust in the side, by Cairbre himself.\r\nThe tears shed by the great Fionn were for his grandson Osgar, and for\r\nhis faithful dog Bran; and a great quantity of poetry has clustered\r\nround the death of this young hero. Oscar Bernadotte, another of\r\nNapoleon’s Ossianic godsons, recently sat upon the Swedish throne,\r\nthough amongst us, this, like others of the Fenian names, has descended\r\nto dogs. It is explained as the bounding warrior, and the MacOscars, in\r\nIreland, have been turned into Cosgrove and Costello.\r\n\r\nThe like fate has befallen the object of Osgar’s love, Malvina, as\r\nMacpherson calls her. The name is a mere invention of his own, formed\r\nperhaps from Maol, a handmaid. It has been adopted by French women to\r\nsuch an extent, that Malvine is one of the regular Parisienne’s names,\r\nand it has further travelled to Germany. Thus Osgar and Malvina, though\r\nwith few namesakes in their own country, are the only Fenians who have\r\nbeen commemorated in continental nomenclature.\r\n\r\nMúirne means affection, and when Anglicized as Morna, is considered as a\r\nHighland name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION VII.—_Cath._\r\n\r\nUniversal among the Kelts is Cath or Cad, a battle or defence, such a\r\nprefix that is sure to flourish in every war-like nation.\r\n\r\nCathuil, a derivative of Cath, is a great chieftain attended by three\r\nhundred followers; and Cathal, as the name became, continued in use\r\namong the O'Connors, who translate it as Charles. The favourite hero\r\nthere was Cathal Crobhdearg, red-handed, who fought hard against the\r\nEnglish invaders; and, therefore, was described by them as a\r\nblood-thirsty ruffian, and by native historians as pious and amiable,\r\nprobably being both characters in turn. His name was probably the parent\r\nof the Scottish surname, Cadell; but a Welsh saint, named Cadell, a\r\nbattle-defence or shield, lived in the twelfth century. He had been a\r\nfierce warrior, and a great enemy to the English; but during his\r\nrecovery from some severe wounds, he repented, went to the Holy Land as\r\na penitent, and finally became a monk, and the patron of many a Cadell\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nCathbarr means tumult of battle. Cathbarr was so renowned a chief, that\r\nto strike his shield with a spear was the summons to his clan to arm.\r\nThe Welsh made great use of the same prefix. Cadwallon, apparently from\r\n_cadw_, to defend, has always been common among them. Cadwallon was the\r\nbrother of the Madoc of Southey, and a much earlier Cadwallon was the\r\nfather of Cadwaladyr, or battle-arranger, regarded by the two parties\r\nmuch as Cathal was; for by the Saxons, Ceadwalla, as they call him, the\r\nslayer of the good Edwin and Oswald, is regarded with unmixed horror,\r\nwhile his own Cymric countrymen revere him as a glorious patriotic\r\nprince, second only to Arthur, and worthy of saintly honours; indeed he\r\nwas canonized by Pope Sergius in 688, and is surnamed the Blessed.\r\nCadwaldr in Breton, and Cadwalladyr in Welsh, continue to the present\r\nday. Cadwallader is also used in the Highlands, though, perhaps, this\r\nmay be a blunder for some Gaelic Cath.\r\n\r\nSaints of this name were numerous. Among them was Cedd, as his adopted\r\npeople called him, the Good Bishop, whose Keltic ecclesiastical habits\r\nwere so distasteful to the fiery Wilfred of York, and who finally is\r\nrevered at Lichfield as “good St. Chad,” a form in which his appellation\r\nlingered among the midland peasantry. The grandfather of Cadwalladyr was\r\nCadvan, whose Latin epitaph calls him “Catamarus, _rex sapientissimus_,”\r\nand whose name means battlehorn. Another Caduan, or Cadvan, was a hermit\r\nwho migrated from Brittany to live on the coast of Caernarvonshire, on\r\nthe isle called Bardsey by the English, and Ynis Eolli, Isle of the\r\nCurrent, by the Welsh. It was reputed a place of so much sanctity, that\r\nit was called the Rome of Britain; and so many saints were buried there,\r\nthat it was a saying of the bards—\r\n\r\n                    “Twenty thousand saints of yore,\r\n                    Came to lie on Bardsey’s shore.”\r\n\r\nCattwg, or Cadoc, was of princely blood, founded a monastery, and\r\ntrained the veritable bard, Taliessin.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Adelphios was translated by the Welsh into Cadffrawd. Sir\r\nCados is one of gentle Enid’s enemies, in the French romance of her\r\nconstancy; but Cado, her son, in Welsh pedigree, swells the roll of\r\nsaints. Cadfar, or stout in battle, is almost certainly one of the\r\nArmorican contributions to the Paladins of Charlemagne, in the shape of\r\nSir Gadifer, the Don Gayferos of Spanish ballad and of _Don Quixote_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VIII.—_Fiachra_.\r\n\r\nFiachra, or Fiaghra, is, as the Fiach is in Irish, a raven. Fiachere\r\nMacFhinn is a son of Fingal, who does his part among the traditions of\r\nthe Fenians; and another Fiachra was the father of the last pagan king\r\nof Ireland, who, as Erse lore relates, reigned over Erin, Albin, and\r\nBritain, and as far as the mountains of the Alps. He succeeded his uncle\r\nNiall of the Nine Hostages, in 405, and went to the Alps to revenge his\r\ndeath. Being still a pagan, he demolished a tower of sods and stones\r\nsixty feet high, in which lived a saint, eleven feet from the light, and\r\nwas accordingly cursed by the saint, and killed by a flash of lightning;\r\nbut his servants put a lighted sponge in his mouth to imitate his\r\nbreath, by way of concealing his death for some time.\r\n\r\nFiachra was the name of a hermit who left home to seek for solitude in\r\nFrance, and lived at Brenil, about two leagues from Meaux. He\r\nparticularly applied himself to the cultivation of his little garden,\r\nand has ever since been considered as the patron of gardeners; and his\r\nausterity was such, that no woman was allowed to come within his\r\nprecincts. He died about 670, and his relics began to obtain a\r\nmiraculous reputation, which increased so much, that, though little\r\nknown in his own country, France is full of churches dedicated to him.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria was particularly devoted to him; she thought the\r\nrecovery of her husband, and the birth of the great Louis XIV. himself,\r\nwere due to his intercessions; and she made a pilgrimage to his shrine,\r\nremembering so well his objections to womankind, that she never\r\nattempted to cross his threshold, but knelt before the door.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, however, that the name of Fiacre was adopted by any\r\none in deference to this devotion, except, perhaps, the Fiak of\r\nBrittany. All it did was to pass to the first hackney-coaches of Paris,\r\nwhich, from being used as a commodious mode of going on pilgrimage to\r\nthe shrine of St. Fiacre, received the appellation they have had ever\r\nsince. It is a whimsical concatenation that has named the _fiacres_ of\r\nParis after the misty raven of the race of Fingal.\r\n\r\nRín means a seal or sea-calf in Gaelic. Ronan is the derivative. He is a\r\nhero whose death is lamented in the Ossianic poetry, and his name was\r\nafterwards borne by a large number of Irish and Scottish saints, from\r\nwhom came Ronan in Scotland, Ronayne in Ireland, once with the feminine\r\nRonat.[98]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  O'Donovan; Macpherson; Maitland, _History of Scotland_; Cosmo Innes;\r\n  _Saturday Review_; Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION IX.—_Names of Complexion._\r\n\r\nNames of complexion were very frequent among the various branches of\r\nKelts, often as mere affixed soubriquets, but growing from thence into\r\nabsolute individual names. _Dhu_ and _ciar_, the black; _dorchaid_, the\r\ndark; _dearg_ and _ruadh_, red; _don_, brown; _boid_, yellow; _finn_,\r\nwhite; _odhar_, pale; _flann_ and _corcair_, ruddy; _lachtna_ and\r\n_uaithne_, green; _glas_, which is blue in Wales, green in Ireland, and\r\ngrey in the Highlands; _gorm_, blue; _liath_, grey; _riabhach_, greyish,\r\nhave all furnished their share of names and epithets.\r\n\r\nDougall and Dugald have been from time immemorial Highland names, and,\r\ntogether with Donald, serve as the national nickname of the Gael among\r\nthe Lowlanders. Dowal is used in Ireland. Donald is the Anglicism of\r\nDonghal, brown stranger, an early Scottish and Irish name, and likewise\r\nof Domhnall, which is probably really the same, though the Irish\r\nglossographers translated it a proud chieftain, and now have turned it\r\ninto Donat and Daniel, or Dan.\r\n\r\nDonald is reckoned as the first Christian king of Scotland.\r\n\r\nTo Beath, life, may be referred Betha, an old hereditary English name,\r\nand the Latinism of Bega or Begga, for a saint, called otherwise Hien or\r\nHayne. She was of Irish birth; but about 620, was imported by some of\r\nthe Keltic missionaries of the North of England, and St. Aidan\r\nconsecrated her at Whitby as the first nun in Northumbria. Leaving St.\r\nHilda to govern there in her stead, she founded the abbey, known by her\r\nEnglish name of St. Bees, and at present serving as a university. A\r\nFrench St. Begga, whose mother was Northumbrian, was wife to a man whose\r\nstrange destiny was to be, first, Maire du Palais, then, Bishop of Metz,\r\nand lastly to be killed in the chace. After his death, she founded a\r\nmonastery, which is considered by some to have been the germ of the\r\nadmirable institution of _béguines_, who did the work of sisters of\r\ncharity in the Netherlands long before the French order was established\r\nby St. Vincent de Paul. Some, however, deduce them from a priest at\r\nLiege, called Lambert le _bégue_, or the stammerer. Begga was probably\r\nimported by the Danes to Scandinavia, where it is still in use, though\r\nthere it may be a contraction for either Bergljot or Brigitta. The\r\nVenerable Bede himself, the father of English history, called Beda in\r\nLatin, is referred to the Welsh Bedaws, another form of the word _life_;\r\nbut it has been more usual to explain his name by reference to the\r\nTeuton verbs, meaning to bid or to pray. However, that several Keltic\r\nforms did prevail is certain, especially among the churchmen of the\r\nnorthern counties.\r\n\r\nMacduff no doubt was so called from Dubhoda, Maormar of Fife. Another\r\nDuff had exchanged the Gaelic Maormar for the English Earl, in 1115, and\r\nDubican was Maormar of Angus, in 939.\r\n\r\nAmong ladies the Irish had Dubhdeasa, dark beauty, Dubhchoblaith\r\n(pronounced Duvcovla), or black victory, and Dubhessa, or black nurse.\r\nDuvessa O'Farrell died in 1301; and this same appellation Spenser must\r\nafterwards have heard in Ireland, when, struck, no doubt, by the _du_ at\r\nthe commencement sounding like _two_, as did the other Irish name Una\r\nresemble _one_, he called his emblem of falsehood, or perhaps of the\r\nChurch of Rome, the false Duessa, while he gave the title of Una to his\r\nlovely personation of the one truth, the one true undivided Church, the\r\nguide of the Red Cross Knight. Irish antiquaries assure us that Una\r\nmeans dearth or famine; but it hardly suits this etymology. Una is queen\r\nof the fairies in the county of Ormond, in which character she appears\r\nin one version of the story of the soldier billeted on a miser. The man\r\nwas amazed at his hospitable reception and entertainment, as he thought,\r\nby the avaricious squire in question, until morning disclosed that the\r\nfairy queen Una had raised the mansion and provided the supper, but from\r\nthe prime cow in the miser’s herd.\r\n\r\nUna has continued in use among the Irish peasantry, though much\r\ncorrupted, being often pronounced Oonagh, and Anglicized as Winny, the\r\ncontraction of Winifred, the English version of the Welsh Gwenfrewi.\r\n\r\nThe female Christian name of Douglas, which belonged to one of the\r\nunfortunate wives of Queen Elizabeth’s Earl of Leicester, was either a\r\nfree version of one of those varieties of ‘dark ladyes,’ or else was one\r\nof the first specimens of a surname converted into a Christian name,\r\nperhaps in compliment to Lady Margaret Douglas, the niece of Henry VIII.\r\nand mother of Lord Darnley. Douglas was, without doubt, a territorial\r\ndesignation from the dark vale and stream of Douglas; but the heralds\r\nand genealogists of the gallant lineage of the bleeding heart made out\r\nan ancestor, ‘Sholto Dhu Glas’ (see the dark grey man), and then Sholto\r\nwas adopted as a name in the Douglas family, and crept from thence to\r\nothers. I have found no instance of it before the seventeenth century in\r\nlooking through the peerage of Scotland, and the probable derivation of\r\nthe word would be _sioltaich_, a sower.\r\n\r\nDuncan was either Donnachu, brown chief, or Donngal, brown stranger,\r\nboth which names were rife among the Scots, and Duncan has so continued\r\never since. Duncan and Donald both occur as Keltic slaves in Iceland, in\r\nthe Saga of Burnt Njal; and, perhaps, not only the Irish, but even the\r\nsaintly Scottish David, may have been at first an Anglicized Domnhall.\r\n\r\nDon stands alone as a name in Hanmer’s list of Finn’s warriors; Donnan\r\nwas an Irish name, and Donchada became Donoghoe, sometimes even now\r\nbaptismal, but best known as the O'Donoghoe, the great visionary\r\nhorseman of Killarney.\r\n\r\nThe word is really the same as our _dun_, though that has now come to\r\nexpress a misty dark grey, while _don_ evidently means brown-haired, as\r\nin the feminine Duinsech. Don, as it stands at the end of the name of\r\n‘The O'Connor,’ simply shows that he is the head of the brown branch of\r\nthat sept, which anciently split into brown and red—O'Connor Don and\r\nO'Connor Roe, like the black and red Douglases of Scotland.\r\n\r\nRoe is the Anglicism for _ruadh_, the colour that goes by the same title\r\nin all our cognate tongues, from the Greek ροδος to the Gadhaelic\r\n_ruadh_, and Cymric _rud_, _rhud_. It plays the chief part in\r\nnomenclature in Ireland and Scotland, where the true undiluted Gaels are\r\ndivided between the black and the red.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Ruadri, Ruadhan, Ruadhaic, the Scottish Ruaridh, and Welsh\r\nRhydderch, have all alike disguised themselves as Roderick, which is in\r\neach case supposed to be the full name of those who in ordinary parlance\r\ncall themselves Rory or Roy.\r\n\r\nIn Welsh myths we meet with Rhwddlwan Gawr, the red bony giant, and in\r\nMerddhyn’s time we come upon Rhydderch Hoel, or the liberal, the\r\nchampion of the Christian faith, who was the friend of St. Columba,\r\nrestored St. Kentigern to Glasgow, and was promised by the former that\r\nhe should never fall into the hands of his enemies, but should die with\r\nhis head on his pillow—a promise that a Saxon long after would have\r\nscorned. He was a discourager of Druidism, and is reviled by Merlin. His\r\nname may come from _rhydez_, the exalted.\r\n\r\nSeveral less shadowy kings reigned in Wales, the most distinguished of\r\nwhom united all the three principalities till the year 877, and was\r\ncalled Rydderch Mawr, or, as it is barbarously called in our histories,\r\nRoderick Maur; much resembling what has been done with Roderick Dhu.\r\n\r\nDearbhforgail, or Derforgal, is translated by the Four Masters, ‘purely\r\nfair daughter;’ but later critics make it ‘the true oath,’ from\r\n_dearbh_, an oath, and _fior-glan_, true.\r\n\r\nDearbhforghal was a very tough name for the genealogists, and they had a\r\ngood deal of it, for it was very fashionable in the twelfth century both\r\nin Scotland and Ireland, and was turned into Dervorgilla and Dornadilla\r\nby the much tormented chroniclers.\r\n\r\nLachtnan, from the Erse _lachtna_, green, is less easily accountable,\r\nunless it meant fresh and flourishing. It is now turned, in Ireland,\r\ninto Loughnan, and more often into Lucius. The Scottish name so like in\r\nsound Lachlan or Loughlan, is however more probably from _laochail_,\r\nwarlike.\r\n\r\n_Glas_, grey, blue, or green, changes its meaning wherever it goes; but\r\nGlasan, in Irish, is its only Christian name, though it was a great\r\nepithet in all its countries, and has resulted in many a surname of\r\nGlass, besides the Highland Maglashan.\r\n\r\nCearan, or Ceirin, from _ciar_, black, was the name of one of the twelve\r\nIrish bishops whom St. Patrick consecrated. He betook himself to\r\nsolitude in a place surrounded with bogs in Ireland, called from him\r\nSaiger, or Sier Kieran; but a tribe of disciples followed him, and a\r\nmonastery arose; so, in search of loneliness, he fled to Cornwall, where\r\nhe lived in a cell, and taught the inhabitants so much, that they\r\nascribed to him even their knowledge of mining; and the 5th of March,\r\nhis day, was considered as the tinners' holiday, in honour of their\r\npatron saint. His name, however, following the rule of the Cymric _p_\r\nfor a Gaelic _k_, has turned into Pirin, or Perran, and is, in this\r\nform, not yet lost among the Cornish miners. His cell had a church built\r\nover it, called St. Pierans in Sabulo, or in the sand, and now\r\nPeranzabuloe. And in the sand it is, for it was absolutely choked by\r\ndrifting sands, and abandoned in favour of a new one. In 1835 it was\r\ndisinterred, and found to be a very curious specimen of ancient\r\narchitecture. Another Ceiran was the patron of the Scots who first came\r\nfrom Ireland; and left his name to many a Kilkeran on the west coast. He\r\nis sometimes called St. Queran.\r\n\r\nCear is the soubriquet of Caoinnach I. of Scotland, who was killed in\r\n621, after a reign of three months. The meaning of the epithet is\r\nquestioned in his case, some calling it _ciar_, black; others, _cearr_,\r\nleft-handed. The king himself rejoices in many varieties of\r\nname,—Caoinnach, in Irish, Coinadh; then, again, Conchad, Connadh,\r\nKinat, and Cinead; till, finally, it has settled into the national\r\nScottish Christian name of Kenneth in the Lowlands, Caioneach, in the\r\nGaelic, denoting a fair and comely, or mild-tempered or peaceable man.\r\n\r\nCaoin and Caomh are closely related, and both mean kind or fair.\r\nCaoimghin was that Irish saint who is commonly known as Kevin, and owns\r\none of the seven churches of Glendalough, as well as the cave, whence a\r\nvery modern legend, versified by Moore, shows him rejecting Kathleen’s\r\nvisit by hurling her into the lake.[99]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  O'Donovan; Macpherson; Maitland, _History of Scotland_; Cosmo Innes;\r\n  _Scottish Surnames_; _Saturday Review_; Butler; _Highland Society’s\r\n  Dictionary_; Pugh; Crofton Croker; _Irish Legends_; Chalmers; Hayes,\r\n  _Irish Ballads_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION X.—_Feidlim, &c._\r\n\r\nFeidlim was a very early Irish name, meaning the ever good, and Feidhlim\r\nReachtmar, or the lawgiver, gained himself high reputation early in the\r\nsecond century, from which time Feidlim flourished in Ireland as Felimy\r\nor Felim, until a fashion arose of spelling it like a Greek word,\r\nPhelim, and then one Sir Phelim O'Neill, who was deeply implicated in\r\nthe great Popish massacre of 1641, changed his name to Felix. He was\r\nseized by the English army and condemned, but was offered his life by\r\nCromwell if he would inculpate King Charles, and on his gallant refusal,\r\nwas executed. His new name caused the Irish poet M’Gee to exclaim—\r\n\r\n                  “Why when that hero age you deify,\r\n                  Why do you pass _infelix Felix_ by?”\r\n\r\nA later Phelim O'Neill, in the last century, who made the same change,\r\nand called himself Felix Neele, was indignantly addressed in a Latin\r\nepigram:—-\r\n\r\n               “Poor paltry skulker from thy noble race,\r\n               _Infelix Felix_, blush for thy disgrace.”\r\n\r\nFelim once had a feminine Fedlimi, now either forgotten or transmuted\r\ninto Felicia.\r\n\r\nTadhg is translated a poet, and was always a favourite in Ireland, where\r\nit has degenerated into Teague, Teige, or Thady, and then has been\r\ntranslated into Timothy, Thaddeus, Theodore, Theodosius, according to\r\nthe fancy of the owner, though Tim is perhaps the most usual.\r\n\r\nMathew is in like manner the Anglicism of Mathghamhain, pronounced\r\nMahoone, or Mahon, and meaning a bear.\r\n\r\nHere again we meet with that universal Amal, as in the Roman Æmilii and\r\nTeutonic Amaler, and probably like them originally meaning work, though\r\nthe direct meaning of _Amuil_ in Gaelic is now, a hindrance, possibly as\r\nincreasing labour. Amalgaid was a good deal in use in the elder times.\r\nThe seven sons of Amalgith are said by Nennius to have been baptized by\r\nSt. Patrick, and the race formed a sept called the Ui Amalghaid, who\r\nleft their designation to the barony of Tir Awlay, in Ireland; while\r\ntheir Scottish cousins became the memorable clan Macaulay, the sons of\r\nlabour. Awlay is the genuine Anglicism, not entirely disused in\r\nScotland; but in Ireland, intercourse with the Danish conquerors led to\r\nthe substitution of Amlaidh, as the Erse spelt the Danish Anlaff,\r\nancestor’s relic, the same name as Olaf, and now this is likewise called\r\nAuley.[100]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  O'Donovan; Macpherson; Nennius; Munch; _Highland Society’s\r\n  Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION XI.—_Names of Majesty._\r\n\r\nForemost among these names of greatness must stand _tighearn_, a king, a\r\nword of most ancient lineage, recurring in the Greek _tyrannos_.\r\n\r\nTighearnach was an Irish saint, who flourished at the end of the fifth\r\ncentury, and whose dish is still preserved at Rappa Castle, in Tirawley,\r\nby the name of Mior Tigearnan, or the dish of St. Tiernan. Tigearnach\r\nbecame common among Irish princes, and even appears in English history,\r\nwhen Tigearnach O'Rourke was robbed of his wife. It was long in dying\r\nout among the Erse population, and remains as a surname in the form of\r\nTiernay.\r\n\r\nTigern was also used by the Cymry. Vortigern, as has already been shown,\r\nwas Gwrthigern, the excelling king, and his far braver and better son\r\nwas Kentigern, head chief; whence he is sometimes called Categern, in\r\nmodern Welsh, Cyndeyrn.\r\n\r\nKentigern in the North, Cyndeyrn in Wales, was the name of an early\r\nPictish saint, who recalled his countrymen from Pelagianism, and is\r\nregarded as the apostle and patron of Glasgow. Persecution obliged him\r\nto take refuge in Wales, where he founded the church of Llandwy, being\r\nguided, as saith the legend, to the spot by a milk-white boar, which ran\r\nbefore him, and on arriving at the spot began to stamp and root up the\r\nground with his tusks. Returning to Glasgow, the saint thence sent\r\nmissionaries to Iceland, who no doubt were the teachers of the few\r\ninhabitants whose descendants were long after found there by the Norse\r\nsettlers, and called by them _Papa_, from the title of their priests, a\r\ntitle still lingering in many a bay and islet of the Hebrides, attesting\r\nthat there the Culdee clergy had been owned as the fathers of their\r\nflocks. After a custom that does not seem to have been uncommon among\r\nthe Keltic saints, Kentigern used every night to sing through the whole\r\nBook of Psalms, standing up to his neck in water. He obtained for\r\nhimself the epithet, Mwyngu, or Munghu, the amiable, by which he is best\r\nknown in his own city, and which has named both it and a large number of\r\nthe inhabitants and of his other countrymen, one of whom, namely, Mungo\r\nPark, has made it memorable.\r\n\r\nWales had a feminine St. Kentigern, perhaps named after him; perhaps\r\nderived from the Irish Caintigern, or fair lady.\r\n\r\nCean, head, the first syllable of the saint’s name, is found in all the\r\nKeltic tongues, forming many geographical terms, generally in the form\r\nof _can_ or _ken_.\r\n\r\nEither this or _cian_, vast, was the Irish name Cian or Kean, hereditary\r\nin the O'Hara family, but often supposed to be short for Cornelius. So\r\ncommon was it once that fifty Cians were killed in the battle of Magh\r\nRath.\r\n\r\nTuathal, lordly, turned into Toole and O'Toole, are his descendants, and\r\nthe feminine, Tuathflaith, is entirely lost. The ladies had several of\r\nthese majestic names; Uallach, the proud; So-Domina, good lady, which\r\nmust have had a Latin origin; Dunflaith, lady of the fort; besides Mor,\r\nwhich the Scots are pleased to translate by Sarah, and the Irish by Mary\r\nand Martha, though it really means a large woman. Morrigu had been the\r\ngoddess of battle among the Tuath de Danan.\r\n\r\nMartha, Maud, and Mabel, are employed to distinguish Meadhbh, Meave, or\r\nMab, one of the very oldest and most famous of Irish names. It would be\r\nmost satisfactory to take it from _meadhail_, joy; but this is far from\r\ncertain, and it may come from an old comparative of _mor_, great. But\r\nMirth is analogous with the meaning of Ainè, the other fairy queen; and\r\n_mear_, or merry, has furnished another Irish name, namely, the\r\nmasculine Meaghar or Meara. Meadhbh was the daughter of Eochaid\r\nFreidhleach, king of Erin, as it is said, A.M. 3922, and was so\r\nbrilliant a heroine of Irish romance, that Congal Claen bids the men of\r\nConnaught, her husband’s kingdom, to “Remember Meave in the battle.”\r\nAfterwards, like other favourite Irish heroines, she became queen of the\r\nfairies; and some of the Irish settlers must have carried tidings of her\r\nto England, when Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson made Queen Mab our\r\nown peculiar possession, if knowing how to make the best use of her\r\nestablishes a claim. Meave, or Mab, has not entirely lost ground among\r\nthe Irish peasantry, though generally it has an equivalent.\r\n\r\nToirdelvach, tall as a tower, or, more properly, tower-like, must have\r\nbeen taken from those riddles of Ireland, the mysterious towers,\r\nscattered throughout the island, and generally supposed to have been\r\nerected in the earliest period of Christian art, if art it may be\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nToirdelvach was king of Connaught at the time that Dermot M'Morough\r\ncarried off Devorgoil, and as supreme king of Ireland he punished the\r\noffender; nor was it till after his death that the invitation to Earl\r\nStrongbow was given. In English history, he is usually called Turlough,\r\nthe later form of the name, which is still in some use, though more\r\noften turned into Terence, which has been oddly borrowed from the Latin\r\ndramatist to translate the tall Irishman.\r\n\r\n_Sealbh_, cattle or possessions (for in Gaelic they are the same; just\r\nlike _pecus_ and _pecunia_, _vieh_ and _fee_, cattel and chattels), is\r\nthe origin of Sealbhach, pronounced Selvach, owned by two kings of the\r\nScots, and of the feminine Sealbhflaith, lady of possessions, now become\r\nSally.[101]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Diefenbach; O'Donovan; Davies; Jones, _Welsh Sketches_; Rees, _Welsh\r\n  Saints_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION XII.—_Devotional Names._\r\n\r\nThe early Gadhaelic Christians were too reverent to call themselves by\r\nthe same name as the objects of their devotion, whether Divine or human.\r\nThey were the servants, or at most the friends, of those to whom they\r\nthus looked up. They used in this manner the prefixes, _Ceile_, the\r\ncompanion or vassal; _Cear_, the friend; _Cailleach_, the handmaid; and\r\nfar more frequently _Giolla_ and _Maol_.\r\n\r\nGiolla is the very same word as the Scottish vernacular _gillie_, a\r\nservant; and in Ireland, the _giolla eachaid_, or horse servant,\r\nresulted in the term gallowglass, which is so constantly used in English\r\nnarratives of Irish wars.\r\n\r\nThe primary meaning of Maol, or Mael, is bald; thus it came to mean one\r\nwho has received the tonsure, or a student of theology, and was given in\r\nthe sense of a disciple.\r\n\r\nCealleach originally meant a devotee, one living in a cell, and was once\r\nperhaps a Druidess, but she afterwards was a female disciple, or nun,\r\nand finally in Scotland has become only an old woman.\r\n\r\nIt will be endless work to go through all the list of servants and\r\ndisciples, and yet some of these present some of the most whimsical\r\nfacts in the history of names.\r\n\r\nGilla is sometimes used alone, and not only in the two Gaelic languages,\r\nfor we have it Latinized as Gildas, the doleful Welsh historian who\r\nrates all the contemporary princes so soundly. Culdee, the term for the\r\nfirst missionaries of Scotland, is also explained as Giolla De. This was\r\nin use, with Cealleach De, the handmaid of God, but are both now\r\nextinct; but not so either the servant or disciple of JESUS. Giolla Iosa\r\nwas used in both countries, but sank in Scotland into the homely surname\r\nof Gillies, whilst in Ireland it was wildly transformed, in the person\r\nof the primate of Armagh, at the time of the conquest, into the Greek\r\nGelasius, laughter; a curious specimen of the consequences of supposing\r\nthat Greek must be better than their natural tongue. Maol Ioso grew into\r\nthe Scottish Christian name of Malise, by which we know the Earl of\r\nStrathern at the battle of the Standard, and again, the bearer of the\r\nFiery Cross in the _Lady of the Lake_. Nor has it ever become disused in\r\nthe Highlands. Giolla Christ was a Christian name in many Scottish\r\nfamilies of the old Keltic blood. In 1174, one Gilchrist was Earl of\r\nAngus, and another, Earl of Mar; it has not, even to the present day,\r\nfallen into disuse at baptism, and is a not uncommon surname. This may\r\nperhaps have been the origin of some of the Christians, and others may\r\nonce have been Cealleach Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Archangel St. Michael was the subject of much devotion: Cara Michael\r\nhas now become Carmichael; but Gilliemichael was more common, and turned\r\ninto Gilmichal. The influence of the great Keltic mission at Lindisfarn,\r\non the North of England, is visible as late as the Norman Conquest; for\r\nDomesday Book shows four northern proprietors, called respectively,\r\nGhilemicel, Ghilander, Ghillepetair, and Ghilebrid.\r\n\r\nVotaries of the Twelve Apostles are not, however, very common. Ireland\r\nshows Ceile Petair, and also, Mail Eoin; but what is remarkable, it has\r\nno servant, male or female, to the Blessed Virgin. In Scotland only was\r\nthere Gilmory and Gilmour; both masculine, and now surnames. Maolmhuire\r\nwas the daughter of King Kenneth M'Alpin of Scotland, and marrying into\r\nIreland, was the mother of many kings.\r\n\r\nSome persons were servants of all the saints, collectively; as\r\nGiolla-na-naomh, very frequent in Irish genealogies. In the Highlands it\r\nbecomes Gille-ne-ohm, and thence has occasioned the modern surnames\r\nNiven and Macniven. They are, probably, all connected with the Welsh\r\n_nen_, sky.\r\n\r\nThis word, in Cymric, leads us to the name of Ninius, prince of\r\nCumberland, who there established Christianity, and of Nennius the\r\nBritish historian; though these are too much disguised by the Latin to\r\nbe easily recognized. St. Ninidh, the pious, was one of the Twelve\r\nApostles of Ireland, and left a hand bell, which is still preserved in\r\nthe county of Fermanagh. Another bell, kept as a tenure of land, is\r\nstill extant in Galloway, and is said to have belonged to St. Ninian,\r\nwho is called by the Irish, Ringan, a prince of Cumbrian birth, who\r\nbecame a monk, in 412 built the first stone church between the Forth and\r\nClyde, earned the title of Apostle of the Picts, and died in 432;\r\nleaving Ninian and Ringan both to be Christian names in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe great object of Keltic veneration was, however, St. Patrick. Nobody\r\nventured to be Patrick alone, but many were Giolla Phadraig, or Mael\r\nPhadraig, and the descendants were Mag Giolla Phadraig, whence arises\r\nthe surname Fitzpatrick, translating the Mac, and omitting the Gillie.\r\nOthers, again, were Killpatrick; but it is not easy to tell whether this\r\nKil is the contraction of Gillie, or territorial, from the Cell or\r\nChurch of St. Patrick. The first syllable of Cospatric, or Gospatrick,\r\nthe Christian name of the Earls of Northumberland in the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries, is less easily explained; but I believe (on Mr.\r\nLower’s authority) it is the Gossoon, the boy of St. Patrick.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick’s pupil, Bridget, had her votaries in large numbers, Giolla\r\nBrighde, Gilbrid, Maelbridh, all now lost but for the occasional\r\nsurnames of Macbride and Kilbride, which last is sometimes the Church of\r\nBride. Possibly, too, the Scottish Gilbert may have been taken up as an\r\nequivalent to Gilbrid.\r\n\r\nThe great St. Columba, who established the centre of his civilizing and\r\nChristianizing efforts at Iona, had many a grateful disciple, as\r\nGillecolumb, or Maelcolum. The latter form rose to the throne of\r\nScotland in 936, when the father, who had thus dedicated his son to the\r\nmissionary saint, retired into a convent. The second Malcolm was the\r\npersecutor of Lady Macbeth’s family, the third was Duncan’s grandson, he\r\nof the Great Head, who, by the help of his sweet wife, St. Margaret, was\r\nthe first to lift Scotland out of her barbarism, and begin that\r\nassimilation with the English which was in full progress at the time of\r\nthe death of his great grandson, Malcolm the Maiden, and perhaps was the\r\nreason why no more kings were called by this Keltic name, so puzzling to\r\nLatinizers, that in utter oblivion of St. Columb, they call it\r\nMilcolumbus. However, the people of Scotland have kept it up, and in\r\n1385, Sir Malcolm Drummond received 400 francs from France, and is\r\ndesignated in the conveyance as Matorme Dromod! Callum is considered in\r\nthe Highlands as the form of Malcolm, and Cailein of Colin. Probably\r\nKilian, one of the Keltic missionary saints, popular in Germany, is\r\nanother pronunciation of the word.\r\n\r\nSecundinus was another pupil of St. Patrick, whom the Irish first made\r\ninto Seachnall, and then termed their children Mael-seachlain, as his\r\npupils. The great Irish king, Malachy with the collar of gold, was thus\r\nrendered to suit the weak Saxon capacity.\r\n\r\nCailleach-Coeimlighin and Gilla Coeimghin are the votaries of St. Kevin,\r\na very unpromising object of hero-worship, if we were to believe the\r\nlegend with which Moore and other moderns have quite gratuitously\r\nfavoured Glendalough. Cœimghin itself means fair offspring.\r\n\r\nGiolla Cheallaigh was common in honour of Ceallach, a very local saint,\r\nof royal birth, who was educated by St. Kieran. On his father’s death,\r\nhe was about to ascend the throne, when his tutor interfered, probably\r\nconsidering this an infraction of his vows, and on his persisting, laid\r\nhim under a curse, after the usual fashion of Irish saints. He lost his\r\nkingdom, and became a bishop, but resigned his see for fear of his\r\nenemies, and retired to a hermitage on Lough Con, where, however, he was\r\nmurdered by four ecclesiastical students, whose names all began with\r\nMaol. His corpse was hidden in a tree, where for once it did not show\r\nthe incorruptibility supposed to be the property of sanctity. The\r\nmurderers were all put to death on an eminence, called from them\r\nArdna-maol, or hill of the shavelings, and his admirers have resulted in\r\nthe surname O'Killy-kelly, or, for short, Kelly.\r\n\r\nScotland had several instances of bishop’s servant, Gillaspick in\r\nScotland, or in Northern Ireland, Giolla Easbuig, the Keltic form of\r\n_episcopus_. Gillaspich Campbell, already Scotticized enough to have\r\nbeen christened by this Gaelic term, married Aioffe O'Duinne, the\r\ndaughter of the line of Diarmid; and thenceforth Gillaspick, or\r\nGillespie, was the hereditary Christian name in the family, till, in the\r\ntwelfth century, his fourth descendant called himself Archibald, and\r\nthenceforth the heads of the house of Campbell have been Archibald to\r\nthe Lowlands, to their own clan, Gillespik. It is a curious fact that\r\nGillespie Grumach and his son, the two Covenanting Argyles, should thus\r\nhave proclaimed themselves ‘Bishop’s gillies.’ Gillespie has become a\r\nfrequent surname in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMaelgwn, or Maelgwas, was his successor in Powys and Gwynned, and is\r\ndesperately abused by the indignant Gildas for all manner of crimes;\r\nwhile even Taliessin, who praises his beauty, rebukes his\r\nlicentiousness. Three centuries later, a bard alleges that he hid\r\nhimself in a wood, waylaid and carried off the wife of King Arthur. In\r\nthe twelfth century, Caradoc, abbot of Llancarven, adds that Arthur\r\nbesieged him in his castle, and had challenged him to single combat,\r\nwhen the sage Gildas and the abbot of Glastonbury interposed, and\r\nobtained the lady’s restoration. Walter of Oxford adds that this Maelgwn\r\nreigned after King Arthur, and finally died of terror in a convent,\r\nhaving seen the Yellow Spectre, namely the plague, through the chinks of\r\nthe church door. Dr. Owen Pugh further tells us, that Jack-in-the-Green,\r\non May-day, was once a pageant representing Melva, or Melvas, king of\r\nthe country now called Somersetshire, disguised in green boughs, as he\r\nlay in ambush to steal King Arthur’s wife as she went out hunting.\r\n\r\nMaél-was, a servant boy, was translated into old Romance French as the\r\nformer, by the word Ancel, or Ancelot, otherwise L'Ancelot; Villemarqué\r\nquotes a mention of the ‘_fable Ancelot et Tristan_,’ from the romance\r\nof Ogier, to show that in earlier days Mael, or Ancelot, was mentioned\r\nwithout the article, which has since become incorporated with it, so\r\nthat Lancelot has grown to be the accepted name, and so universally\r\nsupposed to mean a lance, that the Welsh themselves, re-importing his\r\nhistory, called him Palladr, a shivered lance. Ancelot and Ancelin were\r\ncertainly early chivalrous names, the latter perhaps confused with the\r\nAnsir or Æsir of the Teutons. Ancilée and Anselote are feminine names in\r\nthe register of Cambrai, of the dates of 1169 and 1304; and as there\r\nmost of the feminines are changed from those of men, it is evident that\r\nAncil and Anselot must once have existed there, either named from the\r\nhero of romance, or translated from some Walloon Mael; and thence no\r\ndoubt the Asselin, Ascelin of our old Norman barons, and the Atscelina\r\nFossard, mentioned in a curious old tract on female names, as having\r\nlived in the North of England. It is curious that even romance does not\r\nprofess that Launcelot was the true name of the knight, thus formed from\r\nthe Cambrian chieftain, though Galahad is there said to have been his\r\nproper name, afterwards given to his worthier son. Launcelot was\r\nbestowed on him by Vivian, the Lady of the Lake, who stole him in\r\ninfancy from his father, King Ban, and brought him up under her crystal\r\nwaves, till he was eighteen, when, as Sir Lancelot du Lac, he appeared\r\nat King Arthur’s court, and became the principal figure there, foremost\r\nin every feat of chivalry, the flower of knighthood; but in the noble\r\nseverity of the English romance, he was withheld from counsels of\r\nperfection, by his guilty love for Gwenever, and lying spell-bound in a\r\ndull trance when the holy vision of the Sanc-greal past by. Finally, he\r\nbroke with King Arthur, and opened the way to Mordred’s fatal rebellion\r\nby his defection, too late repenting, and after Arthur’s fall becoming a\r\nhermit and a penitent.\r\n\r\nHis story was told with deep warning in England, but in Italy it was\r\n‘Lancilotto’ that Francesca di Rimini looked back to as the tale that\r\nhad been the spark to awaken fatal passion.\r\n\r\nHe has ever since been regarded as the type of penitence for misdirected\r\nlove and chivalrous prowess, and in consequence Lancelot, and its\r\ncontraction Lance, have never been entirely out of use in England,\r\nthough not universal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                        NAMES OF CYMRIC ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION I.—_The Round Table._\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable fact, that the grand cycle of our national\r\nromance and poetry, has been made to centre round the hero of a people\r\nwhom we have subdued, and were holding in our power with difficulty, at\r\nthe very time that minstrels were singing the adventures of the leader\r\nwho had for the longest time kept our forces in check.\r\n\r\nMany a patriot has fought as boldly as Arthur, many a nation has held\r\nout as bravely as the remains of the Britons; but as the “battle is not\r\nto the strong,” so renown is not to the most able; and it was to a very\r\npeculiar concatenation of circumstances that the Britons owed it that\r\ntheir struggles in Somerset, Cornwall, and Strathclyde should have been\r\nmagnified into victories over Rome and half Europe, and themselves\r\nmetamorphosed from wild Cymry, with a little Roman polish and\r\ndiscipline, into ideal models of chivalry.\r\n\r\nThat they did fight there can be no doubt. If the dismal groans of the\r\nBritons were ever sent at all, it was but a small number who groaned. As\r\nto the Anglo-Saxons, they had been coming even before the Romans, and\r\nCarausius and his fleet held them in check for awhile; but there can be\r\nno doubt that they came in much greater numbers, and with more intent to\r\nsettle, than in former times, in the decay of the empire. Moreover, the\r\nresistance evidently became more resolute and valid, as the tide flowed\r\nwestward over the diagonally arranged strata of the island; the alluvial\r\nlands to the east have no traditions of battles, but at the chalk downs,\r\nthe rounded hills have names and dim legends of fights and of camps, and\r\ncities begin to claim to be the scene of Arthur’s court.\r\n\r\nWestward again, with the sandstone hill and smiling valley, the tales\r\nmultiply spots where the court was held in perplexing multitude; river\r\nupon river puts forth its old Keltic name of Cam, the crooked, and calls\r\nitself the place of the last decisive fight. And when the moorland and\r\nmountain are actually reached, and the heather stretches wide over the\r\ngranite moor, with the igneous peak of stone crowning the lofty crag,\r\nthere the Briton is still free, and points to his rocky summits as his\r\nhero’s home.\r\n\r\nTo those fastnesses were the Cymry finally limited, if they would enjoy\r\ntheir native government; and though many remained as serfs, and some as\r\nclergy, in the open country, the national spirit was confined to those\r\nwho dwelt in the strongholds of the West. There did their bards sing and\r\ntell tales, and compose _Triads_ on the past glories of their race, with\r\na natural tendency to magnify the exploits of their most able defender.\r\nAt the same time, the Armoricans on the other side of the water, some of\r\nwhom had, probably, according to their tradition, migrated from Britain,\r\ntold their own legends, and sung their songs on the chief who had\r\nmaintained the cause of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Normans settled in Neustria, their lively fancy caught up all\r\nthat was imaginative among those around them. It is from their arrival\r\nthat the first dawn of French literature dates, and it seems to have\r\nbeen they who first listened to the Breton lays, and brought them\r\nforward in the French tongue. At the central court of France, the Norman\r\ntrouvère met the Provençal troubadour, and their repertory of tales was\r\nexchanged, the one giving his native Norse myths, tinctured with Keltic\r\nheroic tales, the other the Greco-Roman and Arabic stories that had\r\ntravelled to him. And there, both sets of stories were steeped in that\r\nmysterious atmosphere of chivalry, which could dream of no court that\r\nwas not based on the model of feudal France, no warrior without a horse\r\nand an esquire, a cone-shaped helmet, and kite-shaped shield.\r\n\r\nThat true knights were all equal, was a maxim held, though hardly\r\ncarried out, in the eleventh century, and the floating notion of a\r\ntable, where all were on an equality, was ready to fix itself on the\r\ngolden age of chivalry. And when the Normans themselves became the\r\nowners of Britain, and brought with them a fair sprinkling of Bretons,\r\nno wonder they decided that the heroes, who, at least, were not Saxon,\r\nshould be their own property. Siegfried and Brynhild had fallen into\r\noblivion, and the British chiefs did veritably flourish on their native\r\nsoil. Geoffrey of Monmouth pretended to hunt up their history in Wales\r\nand Brittany; Marie of France more faithfully reproduced her native lays\r\nin Norman-French; and as fresh tales were discovered or invented,\r\nmetrical romances spread them far and wide, and began all to place their\r\nscene at the court of Arthur. Most noted among these, was the story of\r\nthe San-grail, the cup of healing and lance of wounding, that may have\r\nbeen a shadow of a mighty truth, but which became myth in many\r\ncountries, until, in the hands of the Cymry, they assumed to be the\r\nveritable original Cup of Blessing of the Last Supper, and the lance of\r\nthe soldier at the Cross.\r\n\r\nA relic-adoring age willingly believed, that to find these treasures was\r\nthe great task of the knights it had invented. Thenceforth, English\r\nimagination beheld the glorious past as a feudal court, where all the\r\ngood Knights of the Round Table, now an order of chivalry, had bound\r\nthemselves to seek the holy relics, that could only be revealed to the\r\nperfectly pure and worthy. Mallory’s beautiful book preserves the main\r\nline of the allegory, though it is full of episodes, and it is the\r\nveritable prose epic of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nFrance and Lombardy likewise believed in the Round Table, but not with\r\nthe same national faith. As was natural, their poems centered about the\r\ngreat Frank emperor, and what they wrote or told of the British knights\r\nrather dealt in the less creditable adventures of individuals, than in\r\nthe ennobling religious drift of the main story.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is these Round Table names that are the most widely known\r\nand used of all the Keltic nomenclature, with a reputation almost\r\nentirely romantic, and very seldom saintly. Among the Arthurian names\r\nthere is not one that is Teutonic; all are either genuine Cymric, or\r\nelse such modifications of Latin nomina as citizenship was sure to leave\r\nto the Britons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Arthur._\r\n\r\nNo Keltic name approaches in renown to that of the central figure of the\r\nRound Table; yet, in the very dazzle of his brightness, his person has\r\nbeen so much lost, that, as the author of _Welsh Sketches_ observes,\r\n“Whereas Peter Schlemihl lost his shadow, Arthur has lost his\r\nsubstance.”\r\n\r\nTo begin with his name. He may have been a Romanized Briton named from\r\nArctus, “Arthur’s slow wain rolling his course round the pole,” and\r\nArcturus, the bear’s-tail, far behind him in Boötes; and Arth, perhaps\r\nfrom them, does indeed mean a bear in British.\r\n\r\nArd, the consonant softening into _th_ in composition, means high or\r\nnoble, in all the Keltic tongues but Welsh, and had been a name from\r\ntime immemorial in Ireland, as Scott knew when he made the Bertram\r\nfamily tree bear fruit of Arths in fabulous ages. Art, a Milesian, is\r\nsaid to have lived B.C. 233; Art MacCormac appears in the Ossianic\r\nlegends, “Art Oge MacMorne kept Dundorme;” according to Hanmer’s\r\ncatalogue of Finn MacCoul’s comrades, Art and Arth recur for ever in\r\nErse Highland pedigree; and in the end of the fourteenth century, Art\r\nMacMorough was the great hero of Ireland, who slew Roger Mortimer, and\r\nsorely puzzled Richard II., reigned in Leinster for forty years, and\r\ncost the English treasury twelve million marcs; so that when he died,\r\n\r\n                     “Since Brien’s death in Erin\r\n                     Such a mourning had not been.”\r\n\r\nArthmael, bear’s servant or worshipper, was a Welsh prince, but here, as\r\nin Ireland, all the Arths are now merged in Arthur.\r\n\r\nArdghal, or Ardal, of high valour, is an Erse name, and was long used,\r\nthough it has now been suppressed by the supposed Anglicism Arnold,\r\neagle-power. It explains the name of Arthgallo, who, in Geoffrey of\r\nMonmouth’s legendary history, is the persecuting brother, whom Elidure’s\r\nuntiring love and generosity finally won from his cruel courses to\r\njustice and mercy. _Artegal and Elidure_ was one of the best\r\nante-Shakesperian dramas; and Artegal was selected by Spenser as one of\r\nthe best and noblest of his knights-errant, representing Arthur Lord\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\nArdrigh was an Erse term for the supreme monarch over their five lesser\r\nrealms, and is still applied by the native Irish to the king of\r\nFrance,—much as the Greeks were wont to style the Persian monarch the\r\nGreat King. This most probably accounts for the term Arviragus, which we\r\npicked up by the Romans, and applied to that son of Cymbeline who was\r\nreally the brave Caradwg. Ardheer is another form of this same title of\r\nthe highest chief, and the later critics tell us to consider this as the\r\norigin of our hero.\r\n\r\nHe is not, indeed, mentioned by Gildas, unless he be the “dragon of the\r\nisland;” but his omission from that letter is only to his credit, and\r\nthe individuality of Arthur stands on the testimony of Welsh bards up to\r\nhis own date, and of universal tradition.\r\n\r\nArthur, or Arthwys, seems to have been the son of Uthyr, and Emrys, whom\r\nhe succeeded, bearing the title of Pendragon in his own tongue, and of\r\nImperator in Latin, which was the language of politics to the Britons. A\r\nSilurian like Caradwg, his spirit was the same, and his hereditary\r\npossessions would seem to have been on the Welsh border, with Caerleon\r\non Uske for their capital; but he was born at Tintagel in Cornwall, and\r\nhe was prompt in flying to the aid of the British cause in all quarters.\r\nThe West Saxons were his chief enemies, and his battles, twelve in\r\nnumber, are almost all in the kingdom of Wessex; but he must also have\r\nbeen acknowledged by the northern Britons of the old province of\r\nValentia, and have ruled over “fair Strathclyde and Reged wide” from his\r\nfortress at Carlisle. After a brave reign of forty years, he at length\r\nperished through the treachery of his nephew; but whether his last fatal\r\nbattle was fought in Strathclyde, Cornwall, or in Somerset, it seems\r\nimpossible to determine.\r\n\r\nThe Cymry mourned passionately. The Welsh bards made _Triads_, and the\r\nArmoricans sang songs.\r\n\r\nNennius mentions Arthur in the sixth century.\r\n\r\nIn 720, a person called Eremita Britannus, or the British hermit, is\r\nsaid to have written about King Arthur; the Welsh _Mabinogion_, or\r\nchildren’s tales, were all centering on him; and when, in the early part\r\nof the twelfth century, Geoffrey of Monmouth brought out his chronicle,\r\nit was translated all over Europe, even into Greek, and furnished\r\nmyriads of romances, metrical and otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe outline of the Arthur of romance scarcely needs to be here traced;\r\nthe prince, brought up in concealment, establishing his claim by pulling\r\nthe sword out of the stone whence no one else could detach it; the\r\nChristian warrior, conquering all around, and extending his victories to\r\nRome; the band of Knights; the vow and quest of the Holy Grail that\r\nbreaks the earthly league; the fall and defection of the two most\r\naccomplished knights through unhallowed love, the death of one, and the\r\nrebellion of the other, the lover of Arthur’s own faithless wife,—all\r\nopening the way to the fatal treason of the nephew; and the last battle,\r\nwhen the wounded king causes his sword to be thrown into the river, as a\r\nsignal to the fairies, who bear him away to their hidden isle. All this\r\nis our own peculiar insular heritage of romance, ennobled as it has been\r\nby old Mallory’s prose in the fifteenth century, and in the nineteenth\r\nby Tennyson’s poetry, the best of all the interpretations of the import\r\nof Arthur himself.\r\n\r\nAs to his name, it was not very common even in Wales. It only came forth\r\nas a matter of romance, and was given occasionally either from fancy or\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nConstance of Brittany gave her little son this popular name, perhaps in\r\nthe hope that in time British Arthur would be restored to England, and\r\nthenceforth Arzur, as the Bretons call it, was occasionally used in the\r\nduchy.\r\n\r\nAn old prophecy of Merlin was said to have declared that Richmond should\r\ncome from Brittany to conquer England, and this prediction caused Henry\r\nV. to refuse all requests to allow Arthur, Comte de Richemont, son of\r\nthe Duke of Brittany, to be ransomed when taken prisoner at Agincourt.\r\nHis name of Arthur no doubt added to the danger, and Henry’s keen\r\neyesight might have likewise detected in him the military skill which\r\nmade him so formidable an enemy to the English on his own soil, not\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nWhen Richmond really came out of Brittany and conquered England, he\r\nnamed his first son Arthur, but that son never wore the British crown,\r\nnor did the infant Arthur of Scotland, so named by James V., survive to\r\nbe known in history. Arthur, however, had become an occasional name; but\r\nit was reserved for the great Arthur Wellesley, whose name had perhaps\r\nmore to do with the old Art of Erse times than with the king of the\r\nRound Table, to make it, as it is at present, one of the most\r\nuniversally popular of English names. Even the French use it, for its\r\nsound, it may be presumed, rather than for its recent distinction, and\r\nthey have ceased to spell it in the old form, Artus, and adopted our\r\nown. The Italians know, but do not use, Arturo; however, the name\r\nchanges so little that Madame Schopenhauer’s husband was justified in\r\nchoosing it for his son as a useful name for a merchant, because it does\r\nnot alter in being translated.\r\n\r\nThe English feminine Arthurine is occasionally used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION III.—_Gwenever._\r\n\r\nThe staunchest supporters of Arthur’s existence give him three wives.\r\nOne of them was she who was stolen by Maelwas, the origin of Lancelot,\r\nand she it is who is the dame of romance.\r\n\r\nGwen, the commencement of her name, is used in Welsh, in the double\r\nsense of the colour, white, and of a woman, perhaps for the same reason\r\nthat ‘the fair’ so often stands for a lady in poetry. The word is\r\nclosely related to the _finn_ and _ban_, both meaning white in the other\r\nbranch of the Keltic tongue, and, save for the fulness of interest\r\nbelonging to both, all might have been treated of together. Gwen, the\r\nfeminine of Gwyn, white, becomes _wen_ in composition, and as such we\r\nhave already met it at the end of words.\r\n\r\nGwendolen is made by the Brut, and by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the daughter\r\nof Corineus, Duke of Cornwall, and wife of Locrine, son of the original\r\nBrutus. He deserted her for the sake of Estrild, a fair German captive,\r\nand she made war upon him, in the course of which he was killed, and\r\nEstrild and her daughter Sabrina, or Avern, made prisoners; whereupon,\r\nthe jealous and revengeful queen caused both to be drowned in the river,\r\nthenceforth called Sabrina or Severn; in Welsh, Hafreu, where we may\r\nhope that the damsel became the lovely nymph who “listened and saved”\r\nthe lady from Comus and his crew. Estrild is Essylt (or Iseulte) in the\r\nWelsh which Geoffrey copied.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh saints give us St. Gwendolen or Gwen as the mother of Caradog\r\nVreichfras, the excellent Sir Cradocke of the Round Table. In the\r\n_Triads_ and the _Mabinogion_, Gwendolen is a beauty of Arthur’s court,\r\nand in the bardic enumeration of the thirteen wonders of Britain appears\r\nthe gold chess-board of Gwendolen, on which, when the silver men were\r\nplaced, they would play of themselves. Gwendolen, Gwen, and Gwyn have\r\nnever been disused in Wales. The first was the daughter of the last\r\nnative prince, and her name is increasingly in favour with the lovers of\r\narchaisms.\r\n\r\nGwenhwyfar is the swelling white wave; but the ocean names of the\r\nBritons are worth noting, when we remember that they also had Llyr, with\r\nBronwen and Creirdydlydd, all certainly mythical.\r\n\r\nWithout consigning Queen Gwenhwyfar to the regions of Regan, it is\r\nlikely that hers was a hereditary name descended from some part of the\r\nancient faith. A Welsh couplet describes her as—\r\n\r\n              “Gwenhwyfar, daughter of Gogyrfan the Great,\r\n              Bad when little, worse when great.”\r\n\r\nAnd the various early tales in the _Mabinogion_, as well as the metrical\r\nromances, always give the same character of the beautiful queen of light\r\nconduct. In the _Morte d'Arthur_, guilty love for her paralyzes\r\nLancelot’s eyes when the San-grail passes before him, the same passion\r\ndrives him to his rebellion, and finally the repentant queen takes\r\nrefuge in the convent at Ambresbury, where Tennyson has described the\r\nparting between her and Arthur in the most noble and beautiful of all\r\nhis poetry.\r\n\r\nGuenever was her full English name, contracted into Ganivre, or Ganore,\r\na form that occurs in old Welsh registers. Jennifer, as they have it in\r\nCornwall, is still frequent there; but nowhere else in our island has\r\nthe name been followed. Scotland has a tradition of her crimes that\r\ncalls her Queen Wanders, or Vanora, and Boece actually imprisons her in\r\nthe great old fort on Barra Hill, in Perthshire; but abroad she met with\r\nmore favour, as Génièvre in France, and in Italy as Ginevra, or Zinevra.\r\n\r\nObserving that the French call Gwenhwyfar, Génièvre, we can hardly doubt\r\nthat either this, or Gwenfrewi, holy calm or fair peace, must have been\r\nthe origin of their own Généviève, though the German etymologists try to\r\nconstrue her as _gan_, magic, _vaips_, a crown. But Généviève was a\r\nGaul, born at Nanterre in 422, and could hardly have borne anything but\r\neither a Keltic or a Roman name; and the whole family of Gwens were, as\r\nhas been shown, dear to the Cymric race, whose religion was the same in\r\nGaul and Britain. A shepherd-maid, like Joan of Arc, Généviève\r\nanticipated her deeds of patriotism, though she wore no armour and\r\ncarried no sword. When Paris was besieged by the Franks, she, unarmed,\r\nand strong only in her pious confidence, walked forth as the escort of\r\nthe citizens in search of provisions, and when the city was taken, her\r\nheroic holiness so impressed the heathen Franks, Hlodwig and Hilderik,\r\nthat her entreaties in behalf of their prisoners were always granted.\r\nWhen she died, in her 90th year, she was erected into the primary patron\r\nsaint of Paris, and has so continued ever since, leaving Généviève in\r\nhigh esteem among Parisiennes of all degrees down from Anne Généviève de\r\nBourbon, the sister of Condé. The numerous contractions testify to the\r\npopularity of the gentle patriot. Some of the German forms may, however,\r\nbe ascribed to the apocryphal Saint Genovefa, of Brabant, to whom has\r\nattached the story, of suspicious universality, of the wife who was\r\ndriven by malicious accusations to the woods, there to give birth to an\r\ninfant, and to be nourished by a white doe until the final discovery of\r\nher innocence.

But unlike other such wells, it is intermitting,\r\nand sufficiently impregnated with mineral substances to support its high\r\ncharacter to miraculous powers, and, in addition, the stones are marked\r\nwith red veins, which represent the blood of St. Wenefred, as our\r\nAnglo-Saxon tongues have long since made her. Such undoubted wonders\r\nmade Winifred a most flourishing name in Wales, and it is occasionally\r\nfound in England, though usually through a Welsh connection, and so\r\nspelt as to confuse it with the true Saxon masculine Winfrith, or friend\r\nof peace. The Irish take Winny as the equivalent of Una.\r\n\r\nIn Breton, Guennolé, also called Wingallok, in Cornish, Gunwallo, was a\r\ncelebrated saint, and was the counsellor who saved King Gradlon in the\r\ninundation. Guennola is the feminine, and is used, very correctly, to\r\ntranslate the French Candide, as is Guennéan, the white spirit, for\r\nangel, both the being and the name.\r\n\r\nDwynwen, or the white wave, was invoked as the patroness of lovers, and\r\nbecame a Welsh name. It is just possible that an echo of this, on the\r\nother side of the water, may be Damhnait, or Devnet, Latinized as\r\nDymphna, or Dympna, though the more obvious likeness in sound is\r\n_damhna_, a reason. An Irish princess, so called, was obliged, about the\r\nyear 600, to fly from the persecutions of her father, protected by a\r\npriest, a jester, and his wife, until near Antwerp her father overtook\r\nher and cut off her head. Hanmer adds, “the Irish in the county of Lowth\r\ndo honour her; belike her father dwelt there:” and Dympna, or Demmy, is\r\nnot wholly extinct as a name.\r\n\r\nThis same _wen_, the poetical form of a woman, or fair one, enters into\r\nthe composition of two other saintly Keltic names. The first, St.\r\nMawdwen, or Modwen, was one of St. Patrick’s Irish nuns; and another\r\nlater Modwen, also Irish, came to England in 840, educated Edith,\r\ndaughter of King Ethelwolf, and founded an abbey at Polsworth. She was\r\nrather a favourite saint; her name is traceable in various places; and\r\nModwenna continued in Cornwall. Perhaps it comes from _modh_, manners.\r\n\r\nCainwen is said to be Cain, the virgin. The first half means splendid or\r\nbeautiful things or jewels, and is connected with the Latin Candalus.\r\nThe Welsh declare that she was of princely birth; but being determined\r\nto live a holy life, she travelled on foot beyond the Severn, and there\r\nfound a solitary place where no one had ever lived, because it was\r\ninfested with snakes and vipers, which she forthwith, by her prayers,\r\nturned to stone, and they may still be picked up in a petrified state in\r\nthe fields. Keynsham, in Somersetshire, is, in fact, famous for\r\nammonites, which thus have given rise to another legend like those of\r\nSt. Cuthbert and St. Hilda. Camden himself saw one of these stones, and\r\nwas somewhat perplexed thereby.\r\n\r\nShe afterwards repaired to St. Michael’s Mount, in Cornwall, where she\r\nmet her nephew, St. Cadoc, and there her name became attached to a well,\r\nin the parish of St. Neots, arched over by four trees—oak, ash, elm, and\r\nwithy, all apparently growing from one root. The water was further\r\nsupposed to endow whichever of a married pair first tasted it with the\r\nmastery for life. No one can forget that best of all Southey’s humorous\r\nballads, where the Cornishman confesses,—\r\n\r\n             “I hastened, as soon as the wedding was done,\r\n               And left my wife in the porch;\r\n             But, i' faith, she had been wiser than I,\r\n               For she took a bottle to church.”\r\n\r\nCornishmen, apparently, never forgave St. Keyne for the properties of\r\nher well; for Carew, in his _Survey of Cornwall_, terms her “no over\r\nholy saint;” and Norden thus vituperates her: “this Kayne is sayde to be\r\na woman saynte, of whom it (the well) taketh name; but it better\r\nresembleth Kayne, the devil, who had the shape of a man, the name of an\r\napostle, and the qualitie of a traitor.” Gwenllian, white linen, is\r\nstill sometimes used.\r\n\r\nGwyn also signifies blessed or happy, and this _gwynnedd_ is an epithet\r\nof some of the favourite kings. Gwynaeth, a state of bliss, is a female\r\nname still in use, and often written Gyneth, though it gets translated\r\ninto Venetia, and, in the latter form, named the lady whom Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby rendered famous.\r\n\r\n\r\n           SECTION IV.—_Gwalchmai, Sir Gawain, and Sir Owen._\r\n\r\nNo knight is more distinguished, either in the _Triads_ or in romance,\r\nthan Gwalchmai, perhaps from Gwalch, a hawk, and maedd, a blow.\r\n\r\nIn Welsh pedigrees, he is Arthur’s nephew, son of his sister Ernnos and\r\nof Llew, king of Lothian and Orkney. He probably had a real existence,\r\nfor the _Triads_ celebrate him as one of the three golden-tongued\r\nknights of Britain, one of the three learned ones of Britain, and one of\r\nthe three most courteous men towards strangers. In a Welsh poem, he is\r\nrepresented as using his courteous tongue in behalf of his friend\r\nTrystan; and in the _Mabinogion_, in the ‘Lady of the Fountain,’ he\r\ntakes such a prominent part, that the French romance is called that of\r\nSir Yvaine and Sir Gawaine. Walganus and Walwyn had Latinized the Hawk\r\nof Battle, and have caused it to be confounded with the Teutonic\r\nWalwine, slaughter-lover; but the Gwalchmai of Wales can be identified\r\nwith the Gawain, or Wawyn, of romance by his friendship with Trystan,\r\nhis relationship to Arthur, and his title in the romances of the _Flower\r\nof Courtesy_.\r\n\r\nIt was Sir Gawaine who in the ballad boldly adventured himself to wed\r\nthe “Loathly Lady,” and was rewarded by breaking the spell, and\r\ndiscovering her loveliness. Gawaine was the hero of the great battle\r\nwith the giant Rhyence, and, though unsuccessful, was one of the\r\nforemost in the quest of the San-grail, until warned by a dream how the\r\nenterprise was to result. Finally, Sir Gawaine took his uncle’s side\r\nfirst in the war with Lancelot, then with Mordred, and died of the\r\nrenewal of a wound received in battle with the former, writing on his\r\ndeath-bed a letter that brought Lancelot to repentance.\r\n\r\nHis name, whether as Walwyn, Gawain, or Gavin, was popular in England\r\nand Scotland in the middle ages; and in the last-mentioned shape named\r\nthe high-spirited bishop of Dunkeld, the one son of old Bell the Cat,\r\nwho could “pen a line,” and who did so to such good purpose when “he\r\ngave rude Scotland Virgil’s page.” Nor is Gavin by any means extinct in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nSir Gawain is coupled in English romance with his intimate friend, Sir\r\nYwaine, as in French with Sir Yvaine; and in the Welsh story, in the\r\n_Mabinogion_, he is Sir Owain. He there sets forth from court in search\r\nof adventures, and falls in with a knight in black armour, whom he\r\nconquers, and thereupon is conducted to a castle, where he becomes\r\nguardian of an enchanted fountain, and husband of a lady in yellow\r\nsatin, with long yellow hair, and a hundred maids always embroidering\r\nsatin. Of course, when Sir Gawain came in quest of him, and he was\r\nallowed to go back to King Arthur’s court, he forgot the whole affair,\r\nuntil at the end of three years, he was recalled by his lady’s\r\nconfidential handmaid, Luned, and proceeded to atone for his\r\nunfaithfulness by another severe course of adventures, during which he\r\ndelivered a black lion from a serpent, thus binding the faithful beast\r\nto his service for ever, and after a due slaughter of giants, rejoined\r\nhis wife, and lived happy ever after. The French of the thirteenth\r\ncentury knew him as Sir Yueins, le Chevalier du Lion; and even the\r\nScandinavians had his story in their _Ivent Saga_. In the _Morte\r\nd'Arthur_, he is Sir Gareth, and brother to Gawain; but he must have\r\nbeen his cousin, as he was the son of Urien, and of Arthur’s sister,\r\nMorgwen. In the _Morte d'Arthur_, Luned is Linet, and in the French\r\nromances she is Lunette. Her name seems to be derivable from _llun_, a\r\nshape or form, and if so, would mean the shapely; but the hagiologists\r\nidentify it with that Elined, the daughter of Brychan, who suffered\r\nmartyrdom on the hill of Penginger, and was canonized as St. Almedha, a\r\nname still to be seen on the sign of an inn at Knaresborough.\r\n\r\nOwain, Oen in Brittany, continued popular in Wales, though, perhaps,\r\nrather more usual at a late than an early period. The notable Owen\r\nGlendower, as Shakespeare has taught us to call him, was really Owain ap\r\nGruffydd of Glendfrdwy, his estate in Merionethshire, where he kept a\r\ngrand household.\r\n\r\nIt was he who made Owen the most common of Welsh names, in honour of the\r\nlast Welshman who lived and died free of the English yoke.\r\n\r\nOwain is so like the word _oen_ that in Welsh stands for a sheep or\r\nlamb, that it is generally so translated; but it is most likely that\r\nthis is a case of an adaptation of a derivative from an obsolete word to\r\na familiar one, and that Owen ought to be carried much further back to\r\nthe same source as the Erse Eoghan, which comes from _êoghunn_, youth,\r\nfrom _og_, young, and is translated, young warrior. It has the feminine\r\nEoghania, of course turned into Eugenia.\r\n\r\nThere were many Eoghans in Ireland. One of them, a king of Connaught,\r\nwhen dying of his wounds, commanded himself to be buried upright, with\r\nhis red javelin in his hand, and his face turned towards Ulster, as\r\nthough still fighting with his foes. As long as he thus remained,\r\nConnaught prevailed and Ulster lost; but the Ultonians discovered the\r\nspell, and re-buried him in an opposite direction, thereby changing the\r\ntide of success.\r\n\r\nEoghan, in Scotland, is pronounced Yō-hăn, and indiscriminately\r\ntranslated by Evan, Ewan, and Hugh. Several of the early kings, who are\r\nall numbered together in Scotland as Eugenius, were properly Eoghan, and\r\nEvan or Ewan is certainly the right Anglicism, though Hugh is made to do\r\nduty for these as well as for Aodh.\r\n\r\nThe same Eoghan seems in ăanother form to have supplied the Welsh Evan,\r\nor Evan _may_ be intended for John. A certain Evan of Wales, claiming\r\nthe blood of the Welsh princes, who became a mercenary under Charles V.\r\nof France, made a bold descent upon Guernsey, and was killed at the\r\nsiege of Mortain-sur-mer, by what Froissart calls a short Spanish\r\ndagger, but his illuminator has made to look much more like a very large\r\narrow. Welsh history takes no cognizance of him, but he is thought to be\r\ntraceable in the national songs as Jevan Dovy.\r\n\r\nAnother translation of Owain is “apt to serve.” A British prince of\r\nStrathcluyd was called Uen or Hoen.[102]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  _Mabinogion_; _Morte d'Arthur_; _Tracts on Antiquities of the Northern\r\n  Counties_, by R. D. D.; Cambro-Briton; Jones, _Welsh Sketches_;\r\n  Chalmers; Percy, _Relics_; Rees, _Welsh Saints_; O'Donovan; Hy\r\n  Fiachrach; Owen Pugh; _Highland Society’s Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION V.—_Trystan and Ysolt._\r\n\r\nThe episode of _Trystan_ is one of the most celebrated incidents of\r\nArthur’s court, and has not failed to be treated by Davies as a\r\nmagnificent emblematic myth.\r\n\r\nThe _Triads_ begin by declaring that the three mighty swineherds of the\r\nIsle of Britain were Pryderi, Coll, and Trystan.\r\n\r\nAnother adds,—\r\n\r\nThe third swineherd was Trystan, son of Tallwch, who kept the swine of\r\nMarch, the son of Meirchion, while the swineherd was conveying a message\r\nto Essylt, to appoint an assignation with her.\r\n\r\nAgain, he is one of the three heralds of Britain, also one of the three\r\ndiademed chiefs, also one of the three knights who had the conducting of\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\nBesides, the three unchaste matrons of Britain are Penarwen, Bun, and\r\nEsyllt Fingwen.\r\n\r\nAnd the tale told by the Cymric race in Cambria and Armorica has\r\nresounded throughout southern Europe. There the mighty swineherd is the\r\nson of Roland and Blanchefleur, sister of Mark, king of Cornwall. Almost\r\nat the moment of his birth, she hears the tidings of his father’s death,\r\nand expires from the shock, calling her babe Tristan, or the sad. He\r\ngrows up to be an accomplished knight, and after various adventures, is\r\nsent by his uncle, King Mark, to Ireland, to bring home the promised\r\nbride Ysolt the fair.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Ysolt gives her maid, Brengwain, a magic draught, which\r\nwas to be administered to the pair on their bridal day, to secure their\r\nmutual affection. A storm rises on the voyage, and, intending to refresh\r\nher lady and the knight after his exertions and her alarm, Brengwain, in\r\nher confusion, gives them the fatal draught, and their passion for one\r\nanother became the theme of the storytellers who preferred guilty love\r\nto high aspirations. Tristrem was married to another Ysolt called of the\r\nwhite hands, or of Brittany; he was dangerously wounded, and lay sick in\r\nher castle in Brittany. Nothing could cure him but the presence of Ysolt\r\nof Cornwall, and to her he sent his squire, with his ring, entreating,\r\nlike the father of Theseus, that if she came to him the sails of the\r\nship might be white, if she refused, the squire should hoist a black\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nShe came, but the wife, Ysolt of the white hands, falsely told the sick\r\nman that the sails were black; he sank back in despair and died, and\r\nYsolt died of grief beside him.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story told by Thomas of Ercildoune, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, as well as by hosts of romances.\r\n\r\nTrust was really a Cymric name, and was called among the Picts Drust, or\r\nDrest. There is a Trust or Drust, MacTallaghi among the Pictish kings,\r\nwho possibly may be the origin of Tristan, since many of the legends are\r\ncommon to Strath Clyde, Wales, and Cornwall. The Pictish Pendragon, who\r\nwas elected at the time the Romans quitted Britain, was called by his\r\ncountrymen Drust of the Hundred Battles, and many of his successors bore\r\nthe same name, which means din, tumult, or loud noise, and thus may\r\npoetically be translated as a proclaimer or herald. Trwst ap Taran\r\n(tumult the son of thunder) was the poetical name of another of the\r\nline. The influence of Latin upon Welsh, however, made _trist_ really\r\nmean sad, so that it was there accepted as suited to the melancholy\r\ncircumstance of the hero’s birth; and Tristram, or sad face, became\r\nidentified with the notion of sorrow; so that the child of St. Louis,\r\nborn while his father was in captivity on the Nile, and his mother in\r\ndanger at Damietta, was named Jean Tristan. Never would the cheerful\r\nGreeks have accepted such a name as Tristrem, Tristan, Tristano; but in\r\nEurope it regularly entered the ranks of the names of sorrow, and it\r\nwas, no doubt, in allusion to it that Don Quixote accepted the\r\nsoubriquet of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance. The earliest form of\r\nthe name was Adsalutta, a Keltic goddess, whose name occurs in two\r\ninscriptions, one at Laybach and the other at Ratschöck in Istria. It is\r\nidentified by the learned with Esyltt, and connected with _Suraya_, the\r\nSungod of the Vedas.\r\n\r\nEsyltt was the French Yseulte, or Ysoude, the Italian Isolta, and\r\nEnglish Ysolte, Isolda, or Izolta, and in all these shapes was frequent\r\nin the families of the middle ages; recurring again and again in\r\nregisters, down to the seventeenth century: indeed, within the last\r\nfifty years a person was alive who bore this romantic name in the form\r\nof Izod.\r\n\r\nTallwch is the torrent, and seems to have been translated into Roland,\r\nfrom the sound of rolling, when the Armorican bards laid claim to the\r\ngreat Paladin of Charlemagne’s court, on the score of his having been\r\nWarden of the Marches of Brittany, and wanted to make out that Roland\r\nwas a name of their own. They had thus caused Rowland to be considered\r\nas a regular Cymric name.\r\n\r\nKing Mark himself was most probably a compromise between the Roman\r\n_Marcus_ and the native _march_, which belongs to all the Kelts—nay,\r\nPausanias tells us, meant a horse, in the dialect of the tribe who tried\r\nto take Delphi. Its fellow, _mar_, passed into Teutonic; named\r\nMarshalls, as Marskalk, or horse servant; and lives among us as our\r\n_mare_, in the feminine. Indeed, Marcus may itself be another instance\r\nof the Keltic element in Latin.\r\n\r\nMarchell was the daughter of Tewdrig, king of North Wales, and, in 382,\r\nmarried Brychan, son of Cormac Mac Cairbre, one of the kings of Ireland.\r\nHer name was, no doubt, a mixture of the Keltic March and the Latin\r\nMarcella; and it was she who must have rendered the name of Marcella so\r\ncommon in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe more common Gadhaelic word is, however, _each_, first cousin to\r\n_equus_, _aspa_, and many another word for the gallant animal.\r\n\r\nEach was the saint who spent his life in Boyne Water, and was said to\r\nhave uttered the curse that caused the battle of Magh Rath, a libel\r\ndisproved by his previous death.\r\n\r\nEach, in combination, has formed sundry names,—Eachmarchach, a sort of\r\nreduplication; Eachmilidh, horse-warrior; Eachaid, horseman, the most\r\nfamous of them belonging to many kings, and rendered into\r\nLatin—Eochodius, or Equitius, the last not so incorrect. Auhy, or Atty,\r\nwere the usual ways of rendering it; but these have been confounded with\r\nArthur, and the name is lost.\r\n\r\nSeveral other Eochaids were kings of Scotland, but they are grievously\r\nconfused by Latinity, and, with the owners of the following name, turned\r\ninto Eugenius; Eochaidbuidhe, or the fair-haired, appearing as Eugenius\r\nFlavus; and Eochoid Rinne Mhail as Eugenius Crooked Nose!\r\n\r\nAnother Eochaid has, by the capricious fancy of Scotland, been\r\ntransmitted to us as Achaius. He is said to have been an ally of\r\nCharlemagne, and begun the custom of lending auxiliaries to the French,\r\nnumerous Scotsmen coming to honour and dignity for their assistance in\r\ntheir conquest of Saxony. Achaius is also said to have married the\r\nsister of the king of the Picts, and formed an alliance with him against\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons. While marching against the English forces, the cross\r\nof St. Andrew suddenly appeared in the sky giving assurance of victory,\r\nand, in consequence, was adopted as the ensign of the Picts, and\r\nafterwards of the Scots.\r\n\r\nThe “double tressure, flory and counterflory,” that surrounds the field\r\nwhere “the ruddy lion ramps in gold,” is also said to have been “first\r\nby Achaius worn,” though he was probably innocent of all armorial\r\nbearings, as he died in 819.\r\n\r\nEachan is the most usual form of the Highland name, and has for many\r\nyears been, by general consent, converted into Hector.\r\n\r\nThe feminine Eacha is an old Irish name.[103]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  Chalmers; Villemarque; _Mabinogion_; O'Donovan; Pugh; Pitre;\r\n  Chevalier; Sir W. Scott, Ed. of _Sir Trestram_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION VI.—_Hoel and Ryence._\r\n\r\nThe romances of Arthur give him, among his many nephews, one named Hoel,\r\nDuke of Brittany, whose niece Helena was seized upon by the horrible\r\ngiant Ritho, and devoured upon the top of Tombelaine.\r\n\r\nThis Hoel does not seem to have been a real character. His name Higuel,\r\nthe lordly or conspicuous, was a common one in Wales and Brittany; and a\r\nprince so called seems really to have fled to Arthur for aid against the\r\nFranks, and to have returned with a fresh colony of Britons, by whose\r\naid he became king of Armorica.\r\n\r\nHe reigned for thirty years, and died in 545, Other Hoels reigned after\r\nhim, the third of whom is said to have been killed at Roncevalles.\r\n\r\nIn Wales, Hywel continued in favour, and Hywel-Dha, or the Good, who\r\nreigned in the tenth century, is famous for having gone to Rome to study\r\nlaw, by which he so profited as afterwards to draw up the famous code\r\nthat has thrown so much light on the manners of the Cambrian\r\nmountaineers, the order of precedence in the king’s household, and even\r\nthe price of animals. He signs King Athelstan’s charter as\r\nHoel-Subregulus, or under king.\r\n\r\nHywel was a name in frequent use among the Welsh princes, and ‘highborn\r\nHoel’s harp’ was frequently sounded, for various bards were so called.\r\n\r\nAnother Hoel was that unfortunate relative of Owen Glendower whom he was\r\nsaid to have killed and hidden in the blasted tree.\r\n\r\nThe giant Ritho is evidently a relation of Rhitta Gawr, who, in the\r\nWelsh stories, interfered to put a stop to a furious battle between two\r\nkings named Nynniaw and Peibiaw, who had quarrelled about the moon and\r\nstars. Rhitta Gawr defeated them both, and cut off their beards, and\r\nafterwards the beards of seventy-eight more kings who collected to\r\navenge them. Of these eighty beards he made a mantle that reached from\r\nhis head to his heels, for he was the largest man in Britain, and wore\r\nit as a warning to all to maintain law and order.\r\n\r\nThe romances of Arthur turned Rhitta Gawr into a fierce monarch called\r\nRhyence, king of North Wales, an aggressor instead of a defender of\r\njustice, who, however, had his scarlet mantle purfled with the moderate\r\nnumber of eleven royal beards, and politely demanded that of King Arthur\r\nto complete the trimming, with what consequences no one acquainted with\r\nKing Arthur can doubt.\r\n\r\nWhence come the names of Ryence and Rhittar? They connect themselves\r\nclosely with the universal words for ruler, the Gadhaelic _righ_, Teuton\r\n_rik_, Latin _rex_, and the _rajah_ of India. _Rhys_ is, in Welsh, a\r\nrushing man or warrior, and most likely comes from the same source; and\r\nRhesus, the chieftain, slain by Ulysses and Diomed, on the night of his\r\narrival before Troy, probably was called from some extinct word of the\r\nsame origin.\r\n\r\nAt any rate Rhys has ever since been a Welsh name, sometimes spelt in\r\nEnglish according to its pronunciation as Reece, and sometimes as Rice.\r\nIt has furnished the surnames of Rice, Rees.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany we meet a saint called by the diminutive of Rhys, Riok, or\r\nRieuk. His legend begins with one of the allegories that arose from the\r\nprophecy, that the weaned child should put his hand on the cockatrice’s\r\nden, for when he was almost an infant he was employed by the holy knight\r\nDerrien, to lead away in a scarf a terrible basilisk, whom the saint had\r\ntamed by making the sign of the cross over him. His parents were\r\nheathens, but were convinced by this miracle; and he became, in after\r\nyears, a great saint, living for forty-one years on a rock on the\r\nsea-coast, eating nothing but herbs and little fish, and wearing a plain\r\ngarment which when it wore out was supplied by a certain ruddy moss\r\ngrowing all over his body. His name has continued in use in\r\nBrittany.[104]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  _Mabinogion_; Pitre Chevalier, _Bretagne_; Mallory, _Morte d'Arthur_;\r\n  Jones, _Welsh Sketches_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VII.—_Percival._\r\n\r\nNo name has had more derivations suggested for it than this. The Norman\r\nfamily so called came from Perche-val, the valley of the Perche; but as\r\nto the knight of romance, he was at first supposed to be Perce-val,\r\npierce the valley, on the principle on which Percy was hatched out of\r\nPierce-eye, and the story invented of the Piercie who thrust his spear\r\nwith the keys dangling on it into the eye of Malcolm Ceanômor at Alnwick\r\nCastle. The romance of Perceforest was even named on the principle that\r\nit was as suitable to pierce the forest as the valley. Mr. Keightley\r\nderives the name from the Arabic _Parse_, or _Parschfal_, poor dummling,\r\nwho appears to have been the hero of an Eastern tale of a wonderful cup,\r\nwhence arose the mysterious allegory of the Holy Greal. A Provençal\r\nTroubadour, named Kyot, or Guiot, professes to have found at Toledo a\r\nbook written in heathen characters by a magician, Saracen on the\r\nfather’s side, but descended by his mother from Solomon. His book is\r\nlost, but two founded on it survive,—the German romance of Parzifal, by\r\nWolfram von Eschenbach, and the Norman French, Sir Perceval, of Walter\r\nMapes, Archdeacon of Oxford under Henry II.\r\n\r\nEqually old, however, is a Welsh legend of Peredur, who is perhaps\r\nPair-kedor, the warrior of the cauldron; Pair-cyfaill would then be\r\nchampion of the cauldron, or bowl; Peredur was certainly a historical\r\nperson, and may perhaps be the same as Perceval. Chrétien de Troyes has\r\na long poem on the story of Perceval, and his adventures are almost\r\nidentical with those of the Peredur of the _Mabinogion_.\r\n\r\nThe story of the orphan, stirred up to chivalry by the sight of the\r\nknight whom he took for an angel, the same as that of Mervyn les Breiz,\r\nhere appears, and Perceval or Peredur shows some kindred with the\r\ndummling of Persia by his ignorance and dulness till he comes to the\r\ncastle, where he sees the wounded king, the bleeding lance, and the\r\nGreal or bowl of pure gold, that are the great features in his history.\r\nProbably, the magic bowl was an Indo-European idea, but there seems to\r\nhave been Druidic traditions about a magic bowl, which Bran the Blessed\r\nobtained from a great black man in Ireland, and which cured mortal\r\nwounds and raised the dead. It was one of the thirteen wonders of the\r\nIsle of Britain, and disappeared with Merddin in his glass vessel.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the twelfth century, the ideas of this vessel had assumed a\r\nChristian form. It was the bowl used at the institution of the Holy\r\nEucharist, and the lance was that of Longinus the centurion, brought to\r\nBran by Joseph of Arimathea, and thenceforth its quest became the emblem\r\nof the Christian search for holiness through the world, only gratified\r\nby gleams here, but with full fruition hereafter. Perceval, once the\r\ncompanion and guard of the sacred Grail, gradually descended from his\r\nhigh estate, and became only a knight of the Round Table, high and pure\r\nof faith and spotless of life, but only on the same terms as the rest,\r\nand though not failing in the quest, still inferior to Galahad.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that his other name, Peredur, has by the sound been turned\r\ninto Peter. One Robert de Barron tells, that from Bran, the Grail\r\ndescended to Alan, and thence to Petrus his nephew; and a story of the\r\nBreton peasantry still gives the adventures of Perronik, like the\r\noriginal Peredur, an idiot at first, but sent to the Castle of Caerglas\r\nto fetch a diamond lance and golden cup, which would raise the dead by a\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nThe later French romances spoilt the nobleness and purity of Perceval’s\r\ncharacter, but he is always one of the best of the knights, and succeeds\r\nin finding the Sanc-greal. But Galahad, the pure and virgin knight, son\r\nof Lancelot, and predestined to occupy the Siége Perilous at the Round\r\nTable, resist all temptation, conquer all peril, and finally obtain full\r\nfruition of the Greal, then, at his own desire, pass out of the world of\r\nsin and care, has, in England, taken the place once the right of Peredur\r\nor Perceval, though Wagner’s splendid ‘Parcifal’ has restored to him the\r\nchief place. I suspect him, as before said, to have been the separate\r\nproduce of the story of Cattwg, first warrior, and afterwards hermit and\r\nsaint, and that Galahad may have been an epithet from his starry purity.\r\n\r\nIn the _Mabinogion_, Perceval has a ladye love, whom, however, he only\r\nloves with distant chivalrous devotion, and who answers to his sister,\r\nwho in Mallory’s beautiful story gave the blood from her own veins to\r\nheal a lady who could only be cured with the life-blood of a pure\r\nvirgin.\r\n\r\nIn the _Mabinogion_ her name is Angharad Law-eurag, or with the hand of\r\ngold, and Angharad, or the free from shame, the undisgraced (from\r\n_angharz_), was continued in Wales, but it is now generally considered\r\nas the equivalent of Anne, and thus accounts for Anna being universally\r\ncalled in romance the sister of Arthur, and mother of the traitor nephew\r\nMedrawd.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh Angharawd, probably the source of Ankaret, which occurs in the\r\nfamily of Le Strange in 1344, is generally supposed to mean an\r\nanchorite; but as it has no parallel on the Continent, it is much more\r\nlikely to be the Welsh Angharad. Annan was, however, a separate name—for\r\nthe three sprightly ladies of Britain are Annan, Angharad, and Perwyr.\r\n\r\nMyfanwy is one of the unaccountable feminine Welsh names, not yet\r\nextinct among families of strong national feeling, though in general\r\nFanny has been substituted for it. It may possibly be Mabanwy, child of\r\nthe water, or else it may be My-manwy, my fine (or rare one).\r\n\r\nThe three primary bards of Britain were Plenydd, Alawn, and Gwron, whom\r\nMr. Davies explains as light, harmony, and virtue. Plenydd, it is\r\nthought, is related to Belenus; and Alawn is erected by ardent Cymrians\r\ninto the mythic Greek Olen, who is said to have been the first writer of\r\nhymns in hexameter, and whom the Delphic poetess, Boeo, calls a\r\nHyperborean; this name is said to mean the flute-player. At any rate, I\r\nhave found Alwn Aulerv in Welsh genealogies as brother of Bran the\r\nBlessed, and this must be the real origin of the Breton Alan. Elian and\r\nHilarius were both used as its Latinisms.[105]\r\n\r\nIt is first found in early Breton history, then it came to England with\r\nAlan Fergéant, Count of Brittany, the companion of William the\r\nConqueror, and first holder of the earldom of Richmond, in Yorkshire;\r\nand, indeed, one Alan, partly Breton, partly Norman, seems to have taken\r\nup his abode in our island before the Conquest, and four besides the\r\ncount came after it. In the time of Henry I., one of these gentlemen, or\r\nhis son, held Oswestry; and as these were the times when Anglo-Norman\r\nbarons were fast flowing into Scotland, his son Walter married a lady,\r\nwhom Douglas’s _Peerage of Scotland_ calls Eschina, the heiress of Molla\r\nand Huntlaw, in Roxburghshire; and their son, another Alan, secured\r\nanother heiress, Eva, the daughter of the Lord of Tippermuir; and,\r\nbecoming high steward of Scotland, was both the progenitor of the race\r\nof Stuart, and the original of the hosts of Alans and Allens, who have\r\never since filled Scotland. That country has taken much more kindly to\r\nthis Breton name than has England, in spite of Allen-a-dale, and of a\r\nfew families where Allen has been kept up; but as a surname, spelt\r\nvarious ways, it is still common.\r\n\r\nLike _mare_ in Latin, and _meer_ in Teuton, the Gaelic _muir_, Welsh\r\n_môr_, and Breton _mor_, are close kindred, and watery names derived\r\nfrom them abound.\r\n\r\nKing Arthur’s sister, Morgana, or Morgaine, Morgue la Fée, or La Fata\r\nMorgana, as she is variously termed in different tongues, was Morgan\r\nMaritime—the derivative from sea. From her, or from some lingering old\r\nKeltic notion in ancient Italy, the Sicilian fisherman connects the\r\ntowers and palaces painted on the surface of the Mediterranean with La\r\nFata Morgana, the lady of the sea.\r\n\r\nMorgwn was the native name of the heresiarch, who called himself by the\r\nGreek equivalent Pelagius, and thus named the Pelagian heresy. Some\r\nwriters say that sundry heretic names lingered about the Spanish\r\nVisigoths after their union with the Church, and instance both Ario, a\r\ndistinguished author, and Pelayo, the Asturian Robert Bruce, as\r\ninstances of names so borne. However this may be, Morgan has continued,\r\neven to the present day, to be very common in Wales.\r\n\r\nMorvryn may be sea-king. “Morolt with the iron mace,” as romance calls\r\nhim, the brother of Yseulte, who was killed by Sir Trystan, is called\r\nMorogh by his own countrymen in Ireland. It is the contraction of\r\nMuireadhach, or sea protector, a favourite Irish name, though, after\r\ndegenerating into Morogh, it was usually rendered into Morgan, and so\r\ncontinues in modern Ireland. It is perhaps the same with Meriadek, or\r\nMeiriadwg, the title of Conan, the chieftain who is said to have\r\ncolonized Brittany, and also with the Welsh Meredith, both as a\r\nChristian and a surname. In Ireland, the sons of Morogh became\r\nO'Muireadaig, and then contracted into Murray. Muredach is said to have\r\nreigned over the Scots from 733 to 736, and is transformed into Murdach,\r\nMurochat, Muirtec, Mordacus. It must have become mixed with\r\nMuircheartach, from _ceart_ (a right), which has produced Moriertagh,\r\nMurtagh, or Morty, as a Christian name in Ireland; but it is now made\r\ninto Mortimer. It is Murdoch in Scotland, once very common, and not yet\r\nextinct, and the North, adopting it with other Keltic names, calls it\r\nKjartan.\r\n\r\nMuirgis, once common in Ireland, is rendered by Maurice, or Morris, and\r\nMurchada has become Murphy.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a name, still very common in the North of England, that I\r\ncannot help connecting with some of these, namely Marmaduke, which\r\nappeared among the chivalry of England about the thirteenth century, and\r\nhas never become extinct. It is most likely a corruption of one or other\r\nof the _sea_ names, in fact, it is not far from Muireadach; or it may be\r\nthe offspring of the Scottish title, Maormar, from _maor_, a steward or\r\nofficer, and _mor_, great, thus meaning the great officer of the crown,\r\nthe term which prevailed before the Saxon Thegn or Danish Earl displaced\r\nit.[106]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Villemarqué; Cambro-Britain; _Mabinogion_; Mallory, _Morte d'Arthur_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Villemarque; Davies; Ellis; Cambro-Briton; Geoffrey of Monmouth;\r\n  O'Donovan; Chalmers; Munch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VIII.—_Llew._\r\n\r\nWe find Llew, lion, naming Lleurwg ab Coel ab Cyllyn, also called\r\nLlewfer Mawr, the great light, and correctly translated by the Latin\r\nLucius, the king who is said to have sent messengers to Rome to bring\r\nhome Christianity, though some think Lucius a mere figment of Roman\r\nwriters accepted by the bards.\r\n\r\nLlew is the name given in Welsh genealogies to the king of the Orkneys,\r\nwho married King Arthur’s sister, and was the father of Gwalchmai.\r\n\r\nLlewel, lion-like, formed Llewelyn, which is not very early in Wales,\r\nunless the Sir Lionel of romance be intended to represent it. A Welsh\r\nLlewelyn seems to have come over to Ireland with Richard Strongbow, and\r\nhis descendants, after passing through the stage of MacUighilins, are\r\nnow the Quillinans.\r\n\r\nThe English have broken it down into Leoline. Llewelyn the Great of\r\nWales was a contemporary of King John, and from this time the name has\r\nbeen much in use, partly from affection to the last native prince,\r\nLlewelyn ap Gruffyd, who perished at Piercefield. It is now usually\r\nAnglicized as Lewis for a Christian, Lewin for a family, name.\r\n\r\nThe old records of Brittany give a most graceful story of the saint who\r\nmade Hervé a favourite in the duchy.\r\n\r\nHyvernion, a British bard, was warned by an angel in a dream to come to\r\nArmorica in quest of his wife. Near the fountain of Rivannon, he met a\r\nbeautiful maiden drawing water, who, when he accosted her, sang “Though\r\nI am but a poor flower by the wayside, men call me the little queen of\r\nthe fountain.” Perceiving that she was the damsel of his vision, he\r\nmarried her, and they had one child, who was born blind, and was named\r\nby his parents in their sorrow, _Houerf_, or bitter. His worm-eaten\r\noaken cradle is still shown in the parish of Treflaouenan, as a relic,\r\nfor the blind child became both monk and poet, and according to his\r\nmaxim, ‘It is better to instruct a child than to gather wealth for him,’\r\nhe composed numerous simple and religious poems, which have been sung by\r\nthe Breton peasantry through the twelve hundred years that have passed\r\nsince the death of the blind bard; one of them, on the duties of a\r\nChristian child, is exceedingly beautiful. Arianwen, Silver woman, was\r\nanother Welsh saint, whose name has continued in use.\r\n\r\nHouerv, or Hervé, is not accepted in the _Roman Calendar_, but he was\r\nenthusiastically beloved in the country for which he had “made ballads,”\r\nand Hervé has been the name of peer and peasant there ever since his\r\ntime. Hervé came over to us among the many adventurers who “came out of\r\nBrittany.” Two landowners so called are mentioned in Domesday Book, and\r\nthe widely-spread surname of Harvey can hardly be taken from anything\r\nelse, though some derive it from Heriwig, army war, a Teutonic word.\r\n\r\nHere let us mention a Breton name, Tanneguy. There was a saint so called\r\nwho founded an abbey at Finisterre, and who is claimed as a relation by\r\nthe family of Du Chastel. It is curious to find Sir Tanneguy Du Chastel\r\nfiguring among the heroes of Froissart, and making his old Christian\r\nname renowned.\r\n\r\nBut the local saints of the Kelts are far past enumeration, such as St.\r\nMonacella, or Melangell, whose Welsh name perhaps means honey-coloured\r\nor yellow. She was a little nun, who saved a hare hunted by Brocmael,\r\nprince of Powys, and is buried at Pennant Melangle. Also there was St.\r\nSativola, or Sidwell, as she is called at Exeter, whose head was cut off\r\nby a mower with a scythe, and who had a well marking the spot, till the\r\nrailway made away with it; but at least she appears in her own church,\r\nwith her head in one hand and a scythe in the other, and she has a\r\nwindow in the cathedral. Once she had namesakes, but they are all gone\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nEinion is said to signify an anvil, in Welsh, though the word most like\r\nit in Dr. Owen Pugh’s dictionary is _einioes_, life. St. Einion was one\r\nof the early saints of the Cymry, after whom is named a spring at\r\nLlanvareth in Radnorshire. Another Einion was grandson of Howell Dha.\r\nThe name is sometimes rendered by Æneas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART VI.\r\n\r\n                            TEUTONIC NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                            THE TEUTON RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SECTION I.—_Ground occupied by the Teutons._\r\n\r\nThe great mass of modern European nomenclature springs from the class of\r\nlanguages which it is convenient collectively to call Teutonic.\r\n\r\nNothing shows the identity of the entire Teutonic race more than the\r\nresemblance of the names in each of the branches. Many are found in each\r\nof the stems—Gothic, Scandinavian, and High and Low German—the same in\r\nsense, and with mere dialectic changes in sound, proving themselves to\r\nhave sprung from a name, or from words, current in the original tribe\r\nbefore the various families parted from it. Others are found in some\r\nbranches and not in others; but there are comparatively very few\r\nbelonging to a single tongue, and the analyzation of one into its\r\ncomponent words is never safe till the same name has been sought for in\r\nthe cognate languages. All the more popular of these personal names have\r\ngone on a little in the rear of the spoken language of the country,\r\nundergoing changes, though somewhat more slowly. Then, perhaps, some\r\nfamous character has, as it were, crystallized his name for ever in the\r\nform in which he bore it, and it has been so continued, ever after, in\r\nhis own country, as well as imitated by others, who often have adopted\r\nit in addition to their own original national form of the very same.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic names were almost all compounds of two words. Sometimes a\r\nsingle word was used, but this was comparatively rare. For the most\r\npart, families were distinguished by each person bearing the same first\r\nsyllable, with other words added to it to mark the individual, much in\r\nthe same way as we have seen was the custom of the Greeks. Some\r\nfamilies, like the royal line of Wessex, would alternate between Æthel\r\nand Ead; others between Os and Sieg and the like. The original compounds\r\nforming names were expressive and well chosen; but it seems as if when\r\nonce certain words had come into use as component parts of names, they\r\nwere apt to be put together without much heed to their appropriateness\r\nor signification, sometimes with rather droll results. Their names were\r\nindividual, but every man was also called the son, every woman the\r\ndaughter, of the father; a custom that has not passed away from some\r\nparts of Norway, the Hebrides, or even the remoter parts of Lancashire,\r\nwhere, practically, the people use no surnames. A family was further\r\ncollectively spoken of by the ancestor’s or father’s name, with the\r\naddition of _ing_, the derivative or patronymic; as, in France, the sons\r\nof Meervig were the Meerwingen; the sons of Karl, the Karlingen; not\r\nMerovingians and Carlovingians, as Latinization has barbarously made\r\nthem. Remarkable features, or distinguished actions, often attached\r\nsoubriquets to individuals, and these passed on, marking off families in\r\nthe genealogical songs of the Scallds; and from these derivations, as\r\nwell as from the fertile source of territorial terms, have most of our\r\nmodern surnames arisen.\r\n\r\nThe words whence names were compounded were usually the names of deities\r\nand those of animals, together with epithets, or terms of office,\r\ngenerally conveying good auguries. They were usually connected with some\r\ngreat hero belonging to the various cycles of myth, in which the Teuton\r\nimagination revelled, and which, for the most part, under Christian\r\ninfluence, descended from the divine to the heroic, and then to the\r\nfairy tale.\r\n\r\nThese Teutonic centres of legend may be considered as threefold. There\r\nis the great Scandinavian mythological system, as elaborate and as\r\npoetical as that of the Greeks, and which belonged in part, at least, to\r\nthe Goths, Franks, and Saxons, though their early conversion deprived it\r\nof five hundred years of development; and Louis le Debonnaire\r\nunfortunately destroyed the poetry that would have shown us what it had\r\nbeen among them.\r\n\r\nNext, there is the cycle of Romance, represented in Scandinavia by the\r\nlatter part of the elder Edda and by the Volsunga Saga, in Denmark by\r\nthe Vilkina Saga, and in the centre of Europe by the Nibelungenlied,\r\nwhere old myths have become heroic tales that have hung themselves round\r\nthe names of Attila the Hun and Theodoric of Verona, who in Germany is\r\nthe centre of a great number of ancient legends, once doubtless of\r\ndeified ancestors.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we have the grand poetical world, in which Charlemagne has been\r\nadopted as the sovereign, and Roland as the hero—the world of French\r\nromance, Spanish ballad, and Italian poetry, which is to continental\r\nchivalry what the Round Table is to our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                      NAMES FROM TEUTON MYTHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION I.—_Guth._\r\n\r\nIt is hard to class this first class of names under those of mythology,\r\nfor they bear in them our own honoured word for the Deity; and though\r\nsome arose when the race were worshippers of false divinities, yet under\r\nthe same head are included many given in a Christian spirit.\r\n\r\nSome philologists tell us, though they are not unanimous in the\r\nexplanation, that this name is from the same source as the Sanscrit\r\n_Svadáta_, self-given or uncreate, and as the Zend _Quadata_, Persian\r\n_Khoda_, and our own Teuton term for Deity—the Northern _Gud_ and Gothic\r\n_Guth_, whence the High German _Cot_ and low German _God_. Others\r\nexplain it as the creating or all-pervading. Others, again, derive it\r\nfrom _od_, possession, and in early Christian times there was a\r\ndistinction between _God_ (mas.) and the neuter _god_, an idol. It is\r\nequally doubtful whether this divine word be the origin of the\r\nadjective, _guth_, _gut_, _cuot_, _gode_. Whether they are only cognate,\r\nor whether they are absolutely alien, and the adjective be related to\r\nthe Greek ἀγαθός—wherever they come from, the names derived from either\r\nGod or good are so much alike, as to be inextricably mixed, so that they\r\nmust be treated of together.\r\n\r\nThe North is the great region of these names; but they are not very easy\r\nto distinguish from the very large class beginning with _gund_, war, as\r\nin pronunciation, and latterly in spelling, the distinctive letters, _n_\r\nand _u_, get confounded or dropped.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that among those from _Gud_ we may place\r\n_Gudhr_, which was owned by one of the Valkyrier, the battle maids of\r\nnorthern belief, and must, with her, have meant the brave, or the\r\ngoddess; Guda was known in Scandinavia; and Germany used the name, till\r\nit was translated into Bona or Bonne, and thus passed away.\r\n\r\nIn the northern version of the _Nibelungen_, the second heroine is\r\nGudruna. The last syllable means wisdom, or counsel; it is the same as\r\n_rune_, the old northern writing, and alludes to the wisdom that Odin\r\nwon at so dear a rate. Gudruna may then be translated divine wisdom, a\r\nname well suited to the inspired priestesses, so highly regarded by the\r\nTeutons. It was very common in the North; eighteen ladies so called\r\nappear in the Icelandic _Landnama_; and it was so universal there, that\r\nJohann and Gudruna there stand for man and woman, like our _N._ or _M._\r\nIn Norway, likewise, Gudruna is common; and, near Trondjem, is\r\ncontracted into Guru; about Bergen, into Gern or Gero. High German\r\ntongues rendered it Kutrun.\r\n\r\nThe _Landnama-bok_, which gives all the pedigrees of the free\r\ninhabitants of Iceland for about four hundred years, namely, from the\r\nmigration to the twelfth century, gives us Gudbrand, divine staff, now\r\ncommonly called Gulbrand; Gudbiorg, divine protection; Gudiskalkr, God’s\r\nservant, or scholar, which is the very same as Godeskalk, the name\r\nassumed by the first Christian prince of the Wends of Mecklenburg, who\r\nwas martyred by his heathen subjects, and thus rendered Gottschalk a\r\nGerman Christian name; in Illyrian, Gocalak; and known even in Italy as\r\nGodiscalco, just like Gildas or Theodoulos. Gudleif is feminine,\r\nGudleifr masculine, for a divine relic; and this last coming to England\r\nwith the Danes, turned into a surname as Gulleiv, then shortened into\r\nGulley, and lengthened into Gulliver—a veritable though quaint surname\r\nfor the Lemuel Gulliver whom Swift conducts through Laputa and\r\nBrobdignag, with coolness worthy of northern forefathers.\r\n\r\nGudleik, divine service, is, perhaps, repeated by our St. Guthlac; but\r\nboth these may come from _gund_. Gudmund contracts into Gulmund, divine\r\nprotection. Five ladies called Gudny appear, which latter termination is\r\na common feminine form, and comes from the same word as our _new_. If an\r\nadjective, it would mean young and pretty; if a noun, it stands for the\r\nnew moon, a very graceful name for a woman. Guni is the contraction used\r\nin the North.\r\n\r\nGudfinn and Gudfinna must be reminiscences of Finn, whom we shall often\r\nmeet in the North. Gudrid and Gudridur mean the divine shock or passion,\r\nfrom the word _hrid_ or _hrith_, one that is constantly to be met with\r\nas a termination in northern names, and which has sometimes been taken\r\nfor the same as _frid_, with the aspirate instead of the _f_. Guri is\r\nthe contraction.\r\n\r\nGudveig’s latter syllable would naturally connect itself with the _wig_,\r\nwar, that is found in all the Gothic tongues; but Professor Munch\r\ntranslates it as liquid—divine liquor—the same meaning as Gudlaug and\r\nthe masculine Gudlaugr; _laug_, from _la_, liquor, or the sea. Divine\r\nsea, would be a noble meaning for the Gulla or Gollaa to which Gudlaug\r\nis commonly reduced in Norway.\r\n\r\nGudvar is divine prudence or caution, the last part being our word\r\n_ware_; in fact, every combination of the more dignified words was used\r\nwith this prefix in the North, and it was probably the Danes who\r\nintroduced this commencement into England, for we do not find such in\r\npedigrees before the great irruption in Ethelred I.’s time.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the romantic story of Earl Godwine’s rise into honour from\r\nacting as a guide to a Danish chief, it is certain that he was of an\r\nhonourable family, of Danish connection, and thus he probably obtained\r\nhis name, which would mean God’s beloved, and thus translate Theophilos.\r\nFew are recorded in history as bearing the same; but there must have\r\nbeen some to transmit the frequent surname of Godwin and Goodwin, the\r\nlatter connected to our minds with the Goodwin Sands, which were really\r\nonce the estate of the ambitious earl. Godin is the remains of the same\r\nin French. It is found at Cambrai, in 1065, belonging to the “Echanson\r\nd'Ostrevant.” The old French word _godeau_ meant a cup, and, as Godin\r\nsoon became a surname of a family which carried a cup in their arms,\r\nthere might have been a double allusion to the office of the ancestor\r\nand to the sound of the name. Godine and Godinette were also in use\r\nthere, but were considered as feminines to Goderic—a very old word,\r\nwhich, strange to say, was, at Cambrai, equivalent to _fainéant_, or\r\n‘ne’er do weel,’ it must be supposed in allusion to some particularly\r\ndiscreditable Goderic, as everywhere else it signifies divine ruler. Our\r\nown St. Goderic was an Anglo-Saxon abbot, and the name, which means\r\ndivine rule, grew so common among the English, that the Norman nobles\r\ncalled Henry I. and his Queen, Godric and Godiva, in derision of the\r\nlady’s English blood. Goderic does, indeed, swarm in Domesday Book, and\r\nhas left the surname Goodrich.\r\n\r\n                “The woman of a thousand summers back,\r\n                Godiva, wife to that grim Earl who ruled\r\n                At Coventry,”\r\n\r\nreally existed, and was probably Godgifu, the gift of God, like\r\nDorothea, as _ive_ or _eva_ was the Norman rendering of _gifu_. Her\r\nnamesakes are in multitudes in Domesday, and, in 1070, one lived in\r\nTerouenne, a pious lady, tormented, and at last murdered, by her\r\nhusband, on which account she was canonized as St. Godeleva.\r\n\r\nThe High Germans, however, made far more use of this commencement, and\r\nwon for it the chief honour. The elder forms are according to the harsh\r\nold German sounds—_Cotahelm_, divine helmet, _Cotahramn_, divine raven,\r\n_Cotalint_, divine serpent! But the more universal spelling prevailed,\r\nas Frankish or Allemannic saints came into honour. Gotthard, bishop of\r\nHildesheim, was one of these. His name, which may be rendered divine\r\nresolution, or, perhaps, firm through God, was also borne by Godard,\r\nabbot of Rouen, and has adhered to the great mountain-pass of the Alps,\r\nas well as to families of Godard in France, Goddard in England. In\r\nGermany it is still used as a Christian name; and in Lithuania is\r\nGattinsch, Gedderts, or Kodders.\r\n\r\nGottfrid, divine peace, was abbot of St. Quentin early in the eleventh\r\ncentury, and named two godsons, the canonized bishop of Amiens, and the\r\nfar more famous Gottfried of Lorraine, who might well, as leader of the\r\ncrusading camp, bequeath his name to all the nations whose\r\nrepresentatives fought under him, and thus we find it everywhere. In\r\nFlorence it has become Giotto, to distinguish the artist who gave us\r\nDante’s face; in Germany, cut down into Goetz, it distinguished the\r\nterrible, though simple-hearted, champion with the iron hand, then,\r\nfalling into a surname, belonged to Göthe. We received our Godfrey from\r\nthe conqueror of Jerusalem, but previously the Gottfried had been taken\r\nup by the French, and was much used by the Angevin counts in the\r\nGallicized form of Geoffroi. In alternation with Foulques, the name\r\ncontinued among the Angevins till they came to the English throne; and\r\nthen Jaffrez, as the Bretons called the young husband of their duchess\r\nConstance, was excited to rebellion by the Provençals as Jaffré.\r\nGeoffrey spread among the English, and the Latinizers made it into\r\nGaldfridus, which misled Camden into translating it into Glad-peace.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Breton.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Godfrey        │Jaffrez        │Godefroi       │Goffredo       │\r\n   │Geoffrey       │               │Godafrey       │Godofredo      │\r\n   │Jeffrey        │               │Geoffroi       │Giotto         │\r\n   │Jeff           │               │Jeoffroi       │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │    German.    │    Polish.    │   Lusatian.   │\r\n   │Godofredo      │Gottfried      │Godfrid        │Frido          │\r\n   │Gofredo        │Götz           │    ——————     │Fridko         │\r\n   │               │Gödel          │    Dutch.     │               │\r\n   │               │               │Govert         │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nBesides these, Germany has Godegisel, divine pledge; Godebert and\r\nGodeberta, divine brightness; and Gottwald, divine power: repeated in\r\nProvence by Jaubert.\r\n\r\nGermany also has a Gottleip, the same with the old Anglo-Saxon Guthlaf,\r\nmeaning the leavings of God, or remains of Divinity, but which has been\r\nmade in modern German into Gottlieb, or love, and contracted in Lower\r\nLusatia into Lipo; in Dantzic, into Lipp. There are several of these\r\nmodern devotional German names, such as Gottlob, the very same in\r\nmeaning as belonged to the Speaker of the Rump, Praise God Barebones,\r\nbut has been continued as Lopo, or Lopko, in Lusatia. In fact, the\r\nMoravians use these appellations, and thus we have the modern coinage of\r\nGottgetreu, Gotthilf, and Gotthilfe, and even of Gottsei-mit-dir, much\r\nlike the Diotisalvi of Italy, and not without parallel among the early\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Goths left behind them Guzman, once either divine might\r\n(_magen_), or Man of God. Guzman el Bueno was an admirable early\r\nSpaniard, who beheld his own son beheaded rather than surrender the town\r\ncommitted to his keeping. It became a surname, and it may be remembered\r\nhow Queen Elizabeth played with that of Philip II.’s envoy, when she\r\ndeclared that if the king of Spain had sent her a gooseman, she had sent\r\nhim a man-goose.\r\n\r\nAnother old form taken by this word was Geata, or Gautr. It was used as\r\nan epithet of Odin, and has been explained by some to mean the keeper,\r\nand be derived from _geata_, to keep; but it is far more likely that it\r\nis only another pronunciation of the same term for the All-pervader or\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nGautr is sometimes a forefather, sometimes a son of Odin; and there is a\r\nsupposed name-father, Gaut, for the Goths of Sweden, whether they are\r\nthe same as the Goths of Italy and Spain or not.\r\n\r\nIn this form, Gaut had its own brood of derivatives, chiefly in Sweden,\r\nbut with a few straying into Germany; such as Gosswin, divine friend,\r\nand Gossbert, in Provençal Joubert, Gossfried, which may be the right\r\nsource of Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nThe most noted of all is, however, Gotzstaf, or Gozstaf, meaning either\r\nthe divine staff, or the staff of the Goths. Twice has it been endeared\r\nto the Swedes; first by Gustaf Vasa, the brave man who delivered the\r\ncountry from the bondage of the union of Calmar, and whose adventures in\r\nDalecarlia, like those of Bruce in Scotland, were more endearing than\r\neven his success. Him the country calls affectionately “_Gamle Kong\r\nGosta_” and no less was its love and pride in his noble descendant,\r\nGustaf Adolf, “the Lion of the North, the bulwark of the Protestant\r\nfaith,” who casts the only gleam of brightness over the dull waste of\r\nthe Thirty Years' War. Thus it is no wonder that so many bear his name,\r\nGustav, Gosta, Gjosta, that it is considered in the North as the\r\nnational nickname of a Swede; and it has the feminine Gustava.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Gustavus       │Gustave        │Gustavo        │Gozstav        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gustav         │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gosta          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gjosta         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │     Lett.     │  Esthonian.   │               │\r\n   │Gustaf         │Gustavs        │Kustav         │               │\r\n   │               │Gusts          │Kustas         │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION II.—_The Aasir._\r\n\r\nTacitus tells us that the supreme god of the Germans was called Esus or\r\nHesus, and though some have thought he meant the Keltic Hu, it is far\r\nmore likely that he had heard the word _As_ or _Æs_, the favourite\r\nTeutonic term for their divinities.\r\n\r\nThe word is known in all the Teutonic languages: it is _As_, _Aasir_ in\r\nthe North, _Os_, _Es_ in Anglo-Saxon, and _Anseis_ or _Ensi_ in Gothic\r\nand High German. Jornandes tells us that the Goths called their deified\r\nancestors _anses_, but it is only in the North that the literature of\r\nthe Pantheon of the race was so developed that we can follow it out.\r\n\r\nThe Aasir are in northern myth a family like the Olympian gods of\r\nGreece; they inhabit Valhalla, and there receive the spirits of the\r\nworthy dead, to feast and hunt with them till the general battle and\r\nfinal ruin of all things, when a new and perfect world shall arise.\r\n\r\nBlended with this notion there is a grand allegory of the contention\r\nbetween the seasons. The Aasir, or summer gods, are always struggling\r\nwith the Hrimthusir, or frost powers, and winning the victory over them.\r\n\r\nAnd further, the tradition of a migration from the warmer East, and of\r\nthe battles with the northern aborigines, is mixed up in the legends,\r\nand the Aasir are a band of heroic settlers from Asgard or Asia, who fix\r\nthemselves in Europe, and become the ancestors of all the various races\r\nof Teutons.\r\n\r\nSo speak the _Edda_ and the various sagas of the North; and though the\r\npoetry and legends of the other nations have not come down to us, their\r\nuse of the names formed from _as_, _os_, _ans_, testifies to their\r\nregard for the term as conveying the idea of deity.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the North, where the pronunciation is the purest, the word\r\nin the singular is _aas_, in the plural, _aasir_ or _æsir_, and the\r\nolder form of these names began with the _aa_, though usually spelt with\r\na single _a_ in Norsk and Icelandic, with an _e_ in Danish. And let it\r\nbe remembered throughout, that the Northern _aa_ is pronounced like our\r\n_o_.\r\n\r\nThe Low Germans change the _aas_ into _os_, and in this way most of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon and continental German names commence.\r\n\r\n_Ans_, the High German and Gothic form, occurs in the Frank, Lombardic,\r\nand Gothic names. Asgaut or, as the Saxons call it, Osgod, and Asgrim,\r\nare both reduplications of divinity.\r\n\r\nAsa appears in the _Landnama-bok_, and Aasir, the collective term for\r\nthe gods, is used in Norway as a name corrupted into Asser, or Ozer. It\r\nis probably the same with Esa, the ancestor of the Bernician kings, who\r\nmay have used ‘Os’ in compliment to him. Aasketyl is the divine kettle\r\nor cauldron, probably connected with creation. It was usually called in\r\nthe North Askjell, and has the feminine Askatla. Oscetyl, as the\r\nAnglo-Saxons spelt it, was used by them in Danish times, when a\r\nso-called marauder terribly tormented them; but Frank pronunciation so\r\naffected the Normans, that they brought in the name as Ansketil; and a\r\nperson so called was settled at Winchester in 1148.\r\n\r\nAasbjorn, divine bear, is a queer compound, and so is Aasolfr, or divine\r\nwolf; but as will be shown when we come to the beasts themselves, a\r\ncertain divinity did hedge about these formidable animals in the days of\r\nname-coining in the North. The first Asolfr with whom I have met was a\r\nChristian, who, with twelve companions, was wrecked upon the shores of\r\nIceland in the interval between its settlement and conversion. They\r\nerected buildings, resolutely refused all commerce with the heathen, and\r\nlived solely on the produce of their fishing. A church has since been\r\nbuilt where they settled. The name has fallen into Asulf in the North,\r\nand was paralleled by Osulf in England. As to the divine bear, he had a\r\nwider fame, for Asbiorn came among the Northmen to Neustria, and was\r\nthere Frenchified. An Osborn was the seneschal who was murdered in the\r\nsleeping chamber of William in the stormy days of the minority of the\r\nfuture conqueror; and his son, William Fitzosborn, was the chief friend\r\nand confidant of the stern victor of Hastings. Osborn figures in\r\nDomesday, and has now become a common English surname, which used to be\r\ntranslated house-born, before comparison with the other tongues had\r\nshown the true relations of the word. Asbera is the northern feminine.\r\n\r\nEsbern Snare, or the swift, the Danish noble, whose heart and eyes were\r\nto have furnished Finn’s child with amusement, was really a powerful\r\nearl at the end of the twelfth century, and his still more celebrated\r\ntwin brother, Bishop Absalom, was a great statesman and warrior, and\r\nprompted Saxo Grammaticus to write his chronicle of Norway. Bishop\r\nAbsalom is believed to have, like his brother, received at baptism one\r\nof the derivatives from the old gods of Denmark, namely, Aslak, the\r\ndivine sport or reward, a name which in Denmark and Sweden is always\r\ncalled Axel, in which shape it belonged to Oxenstjerna, the beloved\r\nminister of Gustavus Adolphus, and has ever since been a favourite\r\nnational name. Aslak is in the North pronounced Atlak, and sometimes\r\ntaken for the original Atli in the Volsunga Saga; but this is far more\r\nprobably the Tartar Attalik. We had a Bernician Aslak of the like\r\nmeaning. Never were there a more noted pair of twins than these\r\nbrothers, of the _bear_ and the _sport_. Well might their birth be first\r\nannounced to their absent father, on his return to the isle of Soro, by\r\ntwin church steeples, built by the mother to greet his eyes over the\r\nsea. His name, Askar, or Ansgjerr, divine spear, was so common that\r\nsixteen appear in the Iceland roll, and the word Osgar gets confused\r\nwith the Keltic Oscar, son of Ossian; nay, it may perhaps have been his\r\nproper name. A Frank Ansgar, born in Picardy about the year 800, was the\r\napostle of Denmark, and afterwards bishop of Hamburgh and Bremen; he was\r\ncanonized as Anscharius, and is popularly called in his bishopric St.\r\nScharies, by which title the collegiate church of Bremen is called. It\r\nis curious to find the Ansbrando of ancient Lombardy reflected by the\r\nAsbrandr, divine sword, of Iceland. Lombardy had likewise Anshelm, the\r\ndivine helmet, softened down into Anselmo or Antelmo, the name of that\r\nmild-natured Lombardic Archbishop of ours, whose constancy cost him so\r\ndear in his contention with the furious Rufus and politic Beauclerc.\r\nThat firmness, however, together with his deep theological writings, won\r\nhim the honours of sanctity, though it is only on the Continent that his\r\nname took root: England had no national love for her Anselm; and he\r\nchiefly appears in Italy, France, and Germany, where he has been cut\r\nshort as Anso, endeared as Ensilo, has a feminine Ansa, and is called by\r\nthe Jews Anschel.\r\n\r\nOf other terms which, like _helm_, give the idea of protection, there\r\nare many; the feminine Asbjorg or Asburg, divine fort, is reflected by\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon Asburgha. Asgardr, divine guard, may be most probably an\r\nallusion to the abode of the gods, Asgard, the abode to which the\r\nrainbow-arch Bifrost was the access, trod, according to the grand death\r\nsong of Eirikr Blodaxe, by the spirits of the courageous dead on their\r\nway to feast in the hall of Odin. As men’s names appear the Norwegian\r\nAsgard, and Ansgard, a Winchester householder in Stephen’s time; but the\r\nNorthern feminine Asgerdur is the divine maiden, in honour of the\r\ngoddess Gerda. Asmundr is the northern form of a favourite name, giving\r\nthe idea of protecting with the hand. It is called Ansmunt in old\r\nGerman, Osmund in Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French, and in this form was\r\nmost popular, at first perhaps, from Osmond de Centeville, the brave\r\nNorman, who fled from Laon with the young Richard Sans Peur, but\r\nafterwards for the sake of a Norman Osmond, who was canonized as Bishop\r\nof Salisbury, whence this form in England and Osmont in France have\r\ncontinued. Aasvalldr, divine power, was in Germany Ansvalt, and has\r\nmodernized as Asvald; but the Anglo-Saxon Oswald was the glory of the\r\nname in the Northumbrian monarch, “free of hand,” as even his Welsh foes\r\ncalled him, who has left Oswald to be an English name. Asvor and Asvora\r\nexpress divine prudence.\r\n\r\n“Aslaug, dottur Sigurdur Fafnisbana,” is recorded in the _Landnama-bok_\r\nin sober earnest as having married Ragnar Lodbrog.\r\n\r\nDivine legacy, or relic, appears in Asleif, the English Oslaf. The\r\nnorthern Aasny, with Ashildur, has always been a favourite. Osthryth,\r\ndivine threatener, came out of the house of Bernicia into Mercia, where\r\nshe was murdered by the Danes, and revered as St. Osyth with a priory in\r\nher honour.\r\n\r\nThoroughly English are likewise Osmod, divine mood or wrath; Osfrith,\r\ndivine peace; Osred, divine council; Osgifu, divine gift; Oswine, divine\r\nfriend, the third of the admirable but short-lived kings of Bernicia;\r\nOswiu, who overthrew him, was probably named from a word meaning sacred,\r\nof which more in its place. Osbeorht we share with Germany, which calls\r\nit Osbert, and has the feminine Osberta. In fact, most of these names\r\nwere in use there, beginning with _os_ or _ans_, according to the\r\ndialect in which they were used. Ansgisel was one of the Frankish forms,\r\nthat section of the race always making much use of _gisel_, a\r\npledge.[107]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Turner; Munch; Lappenberg; Mallet; _Landnama-bok_; _Domesday_;\r\n  Michaelis; Hermann Luning, _Edda_; _Hist. of Scandinavia_; Marryat,\r\n  _Jutland_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION III.—_Odin, or Grîmr._\r\n\r\nThe head of the Aasir was Odin, as we have learned to call him from the\r\nNorth, which worshipped him long after we had forgotten our Wuotan,\r\nexcept in the title of his day of the week. There are various opinions\r\nas to the meaning of his name, some making it come from the word for\r\nrage in the North, _odhr_; in A. S., _wod_; and still _wuth_ in German;\r\nand the adjective _wud_ in Scottish. It thus may allude to Odin being\r\nthe god of storm and tempest. Others take the name from O. G., _watan_,\r\nN., _vatha_, to pervade, the title of the Divinity, as being _through_\r\nall things. This is, in fact, the same as God.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, Odin, in the higher myths, is the All-father,\r\nstanding at the head of Asgard, as Zeus does of Olympus. He governs all\r\nthings, and knows all things. He obtained this mighty influence, says\r\nthe _Edda_, by hanging for nine nights on the world-tree, Yggdrasil,\r\nwithout food or drink, transfixed with a spear, as a self-sacrifice.\r\nThen he looked down into the depth, and sank from the tree into it; but\r\nin the abyss beneath he drank the costly poet-mead, and learnt powerful\r\nsongs, obtaining the Runes, the beginning of wisdom, by which he could\r\ncompel to his will all nature: wind, sea, and fire, hate and love!\r\n\r\nCoupled with this entirely divine Odin, there was the abiding notion of\r\nancestry beginning with a god; and no one, of any nobility, was content\r\nwithout having Odin for his forefather. Even when Christianity dethroned\r\nOdin from his place in Heaven, he was still retained as a heroic\r\nancestor; and somewhat grotesquely, the old chroniclers, after carrying\r\nup their kings to him, brought him down from Noah, and he became reduced\r\nto be the leader of the great migration from Asia, while the gods were\r\nmade his human sons.\r\n\r\nWe do not find Odin itself forming part of any personal name; it seems\r\nto have been avoided as Zeus was in Greece, and, to a greater degree,\r\nJupiter in Rome. But he had no less than forty-nine epithets, all of\r\nwhich are rehearsed in the prose _Edda_, and his votaries were called by\r\none or other of these.\r\n\r\nFinn has been spoken of already as one of these; also Gautr, as one of\r\nthe forms of divinity. Grîmr is another, coming from the old Norse word\r\n_grîma_, a mask or helmet. Odin was called Grimr, meaning the concealed,\r\nor possibly the helmeted; and the names beginning with Grim may\r\ngenerally be referred to the hidden god.\r\n\r\nGrîmhild, or in High German, Krimhild, was originally one of the\r\nValkyrier, or choosers of the slain, who was so called, as being endowed\r\nwith a helmet of terror. Hidden battle-maid, or helmeted battle-maid,\r\nwould be her fittest translation. In the northern version of the\r\n_Nibelungenlied_, Grimhild is the witch-mother of Sigurd’s wife, Gudrun,\r\nand performs a part like that of the Oda, or Uta, in the German and\r\nDanish versions, in which the heroine herself is called Kriemhild, or\r\nChriemhild, and does her fatal part in wreaking revenge for the murder\r\nof her husband. Grimhhildur was somewhat used in the North, but nothing\r\nwas so fashionable as Grim, who occurs twenty-nine times in the\r\n_Landnama-bok_, and with equal frequency in Domesday; besides that one\r\nof these Danish settlers left his name to Grimsby, in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nGrim has, of course, his kettle, in the North, Grimketyl, or Grimkjell;\r\nin Domesday, Grimchel; an allusion, probably, to creation, quaint as is\r\nthe sound to our ears. Grimperaht, or helmeted splendour, first was\r\nturned into Grimbert, then into the common German surname of Grimmert.\r\nGrimar in the North was Grimheri in Germany. Grim was in greater favour\r\nas a prefix in the High German dialects than in the North, and chiefly\r\nin the Frankish regions.\r\n\r\nGrimbald, helmeted prince, was a monk of St. Omer, transplanted by King\r\nAlfred to Oxford, in the hope of promoting learning, and he thus became\r\na Saxon saint. Grimvald, helmeted ruler, was a _maire du palais_ in the\r\nFaineant times of the Franks; and in Spanish balled el Conde Grimaltos,\r\na knight at the court of Charlemagne, was slandered and driven away with\r\nhis wife to the mountains, where the lady gives birth to a son, who was\r\nbaptized Montesinos, from the place of his birth, and educated in all\r\nchivalry till he was old enough to go to Charlemagne’s court, refute the\r\nslander by the ordeal of battle, and restore his family to favour.\r\nGrimaldo was a name borne by the Lombard kings, and left remains in the\r\ngreat Grimaldi family of Genoa.\r\n\r\nMost of our English Grims were importations, and there are few of them,\r\nthough we have Grimulf in Domesday, probably a Dane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION IV.—_Frey._\r\n\r\nEvery false religion preserves in some form or other the perception of a\r\nDivine Trinity, and the Teutonic Triad consisted of Odin, Frey, and\r\nThor, whose images always occupied the place of honour in the temples,\r\nand who owned the three midmost days of the week.\r\n\r\nThe history of the word _freyr_ is very curious. The root is found in\r\n_pri_, Skt., to love or rejoice, the Zend _frî_, the Greek φίλος. To be\r\nglad was also to be free; so _freon_ or _frigon_ means to free and to\r\nlove, and thence _free_ in all its forms (N. _fri_; Goth, _frige_; H. G.\r\n_frei_; L. G. _freoh_). Thus, again, the Germans came by _froh_, and we\r\nby _fresh_. _Fro_ was both glad and dear; and as in Gothic _frowida_ was\r\njoy, so is _freude_ in modern German; and we exult in _frolics_ and\r\n_freaks_. He who loved was known by the present participle, _frigonds_,\r\nthe _friend_ of modern English, the same in all our Teutonic tongues;\r\nand as the effect of love is peace, the term was _fred_ or _fried_, our\r\nSaxon _frith_, which we have lost in the French-Latin word. To be free\r\nwas to be noble, so the free noble was _Frauja_, the name by which\r\nUlfilas always translates Κύριος, in the New Testament, by a beautiful\r\nanalogy, showing, indeed, that our Lord is our Friend and our Redeemer,\r\nloving us, and setting us free.\r\n\r\n_Frauja_, or free, was the lord and master, so his wife was likewise\r\n_frea_, both the beloved and the free woman; the northern _frue_, German\r\n_frau_, and Dutch _vrowe_, all, as _donna_ had done in Italy, becoming\r\nthe generic term for woman.\r\n\r\nOut of all the derivatives of this fertile and beautiful term, there\r\nwere large contributions to mythology, and a great number of names.\r\n\r\nFreyr, lord, lover, was once a god of very high rank, lord of sun and\r\nmoon, hermaphrodite, and regulating the seasons, blessing marriage, and\r\nguarding purity: and this was probably a universal idea brought from\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nAs old notions formed into mythic tales, and the gods grew human, the\r\nwife of Odin was invented, and what could she be but the _frau_, the\r\nlady of Asgard, Frigga? Again, Freyr was brought down from his\r\nmysterious vagueness, and turned into a nephew of Odin, with the moon to\r\ntake care of, and, moreover, was disintegrated into a brother and\r\nsister, called Freyr and Freya.\r\n\r\nThe sixth day of the week had probably originally belonged to Freyr, but\r\nFrigga got possession of it; and, in right of her presiding over love\r\nand marriage, she was considered to be Venus; and in France and Italy\r\nher day is still Vendredi and Venerdì, while we have it as Friday, the\r\nGermans as Freitag, the North as Fredag.\r\n\r\nFreya is also a goddess of love, and drives over every battle-field with\r\nher car drawn by cats (once, perhaps, panthers, like those of Bacchus,\r\nwhom her brother is thought to resemble), and chooses half the slain,\r\nwhom she marshals to their seats at the banquet of Valhalla. Her\r\nhusband, Othur or Odhr, curiously repeats Odin’s name, as she does\r\nFrigga’s. She weeps continually drops of gold when he is absent, and the\r\nmetal is poetically called Freya’s tears.\r\n\r\nHer brother, Freyr, was always a chaste, dignified, beneficent\r\npersonage, a sort of severe Bacchus, or grave Apollo. In the great final\r\nbattle, he is to be destroyed by Surti. He is the tutelary god of\r\nSweden, as was Odin of the Saxons.\r\n\r\nThere are hosts of names connected with these deities, or the words\r\nsprung from their source. _Frith_ in Saxon, _frey_ or _freya_ in the\r\nNorth, _fried_ in German, falling in France into _froi_, was a favourite\r\ntermination generally masculine, and so probably in honour of Freyr; and\r\nthough it is safe to translate it peace, it probably also meant freedom.\r\n\r\nOld Spanish has Froila, or Fruela, among the kings of the Asturias, and\r\nthis may be translated lord, and compared with the Freavine, or Frowin,\r\nfree darling, now become Frewen. Franta, too, was a king of the Spanish\r\nSuevi.\r\n\r\nFritigern, king of the Visigoths, who first fixed himself on the Danube,\r\nbore the name afterwards Frideger (spear of peace), in Germany, a\r\ncompound much resembling that borne by that Jezebel of the Meerwings,\r\nFredegunt, or Frédégonde, as she is called by French historians.\r\nFreygerdur of the North, as found in the _Landnama-bok_, serving four\r\nmen and two women, is there explained either as freedom-preserver, or\r\npeace-keeper.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be said of Fridthjof, or Frithjof, the renowned hero of\r\nthe Frithjofsaga, being no better than peace-thief? Northern pirates\r\nthought no scorn of being thieves, and we shall fall on plenty more of\r\nthem; but the compound is certainly startling.\r\n\r\nFridulf, or Fridolf, peace wolf, is nearly as bad; but it seems to have\r\ncontracted into Friedel in Germany, and expanded into Fridolin, probably\r\nin imitation of Fedlim, or some such Erse name, since the saint thus\r\nrecorded in the calendar is one of the many Scottish missionaries of the\r\nfifth century, who preached to the Burgundians. He is the titular patron\r\nof the Swiss canton of Glarus, whose shield bears his figure in the\r\nBenedictine dress he never wore. Thence Schiller took the name of the\r\nyouth in his ballad on the strange adventure of Isabel de la Paz of\r\nPortugal, which is best known through Retzch’s illustrations. The German\r\nFriedel must be short for this, as Frider is for Fridheri,\r\npeace-warrior. In fact, Germany is the great land of this commencement,\r\nand has fostered the best known of the whole. There was indeed a\r\nFridrikr in the _Landnama-bok_, and a Fredreg, or Frederic, in Domesday,\r\nbut these would have been forgotten but for an old Frisian bishop,\r\nFreodhoric, who, in the time of Louis le Debonnaire, had been murdered\r\nwhile praying in his chapel, and being canonized, was a patron saint of\r\nthe Swabian house. Friedrich with the red beard, or Barbarossa, a\r\nGhibelline hero, caused Federigo to be popular among that party in\r\nItaly; and when his Neapolitan grandson’s claims to the kingdom of the\r\nTwo Sicilies had been transmitted, through Manfred’s daughter, to the\r\nAragonese monarchs, Fadrique became usual in Spain. Friedrich had grown\r\nnational in Germany, and not a king of Prussia till the present has\r\nreigned without being so called, in compliment to their hero, who, while\r\nthe soldiers called him Old Fritz, thought it graceful to write himself\r\nFrédéric, having with his French tastes, taken a dislike to the sound of\r\nhis own name, even in the softened spelling of his adopted language. It\r\nwas from the father of this monarch that the son of George II. was\r\ncalled Frederick, a name we have twice had next in succession to the\r\ncrown. The Danes obtained the name from their German connections, and\r\nmake it alternate on the throne with Christiern. The feminine is a late\r\ninvention in Germany, very common there but barely recognized elsewhere.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    Breton.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Frederick      │Frédéric       │Fêidrik        │Fadrique       │\r\n   │Fred           │Ferry          │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │   Italian.    │    German.    │    Dutch.     │\r\n   │               │               │               │               │\r\n   │Frederico      │Federigo       │Fridrich       │Frederik       │\r\n   │Federico       │               │Fritz          │Freerik        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Frisian.    │   Swedish.    │    Danish.    │    Swiss.     │\r\n   │Frerk          │Fredrik        │Frederik       │Fredli         │\r\n   │Frek           │               │               │Fridli         │\r\n   │Friko          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Russian.    │    Polish.    │    Slovak.    │   Bohemia.    │\r\n   │Fridrich       │Fryderyk       │Friderik       │Bedrich        │\r\n   │               │Fryc           │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │   Lettish.    │  Lithuanian.  │     Finn.     │\r\n   │Fidrich        │Sprizzis       │Prydas         │Rietu          │\r\n   │Bedrich        │Prizzis        │Prydikis       │Wettrikki      │\r\n   │   ————————    │Wrizzis        │Priczus        │Wetu           │\r\n   │  Hungarian.   │Wridriks       │   ————————    │Wetukka        │\r\n   │Fridrik        │Pridriks       │    Greek.     │               │\r\n   │               │               │Φρεσδερικος    │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Portuguese   │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Frederica      │Frédérigue     │Frederica      │Federica       │\r\n   │Freddie        │               │               │Feriga         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Swiss.     │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │\r\n   │Fridrike       │Fredrika       │Frydryka       │Bedriska       │\r\n   │Fritze         │   ————————    │               │               │\r\n   │Fritzinn       │    Greek.     │               │               │\r\n   │Rike           │Φρεδερική      │               │               │\r\n   │Rikchen        │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nProbably this popular Frederick has devoured all the other forms with\r\nthe same commencement; for after the middle ages had fairly begun, we\r\nhardly ever hear of the German Fridrad, Fridrada, Fridhelm, Fridrun,\r\nFridbald, Fridbert, Fridburg, Fridgard, Fridilind. Fridmund, peace\r\nprotection, Fridwald, peace-power, has been preserved in Friesland as\r\nFredewolt, Fredo, or Freddo. Fridleifr in the North has fallen into\r\nFriedlieb in Germany: it is the same as the Frithlaf whom our Saxon\r\nchroniclers bestowed on Wuotan by way of ancestor.\r\n\r\nOur own Saxon saint, Frithswith, strong in peace, was the daughter of\r\nthe Lord of Oxford, in the eighth century. She lived in a little cell at\r\nThornbury, had various legendary adventures, which may be seen portrayed\r\nin a modern window of the cathedral at Oxford, and became the saintly\r\npatroness of the University and Cathedral, where, by the name of St.\r\nFridiswid, she reigned over Alma Mater, till Wolsey laid hold of the\r\nchurch and its chapter for his own splendid foundation of Christchurch.\r\nFrethesantha Paynell was wife of Geoffrey Lutterell, about the\r\nfourteenth century; and Fridiswid is by no means uncommon in the old\r\ngenealogies of Essex and the northern counties. Alban Butler gives\r\nFrewissa as the contraction; but in Ireland, according to Mr. Britton’s\r\ncapital story of _The Election_, it is Fiddy.\r\n\r\nFrom _frei_, free, modern Germany has taken Freimund, by which they mean\r\nFreemouth, though it ought to be free protection, Freimuth, free\r\ncourage, Freidank, free thought. But the older word for free plays a far\r\nmore important part in modern nomenclature, namely, _Frang_, the High\r\nGerman form of free lord.\r\n\r\nThe nation called Cherusci by Tacitus denominated themselves Frangen\r\nwhen they warred on northern Gaul, overspread it, and termed it for\r\nthemselves Frankreich. As their primary energy decayed their dominion\r\ndivided; Frankenland, under the Latinism of Franconia, became leagued\r\nwith the lands of the Swabians, Allemanni, and Saxons, and thus became\r\npart of Deutschland and of the Holy Roman Empire, while Frankreich was\r\nleavened by the Gallo-Romans, who worked up through their Frank lords,\r\nand made their clipped Latin, or _Langue d’oui_[108] (the tongue of\r\naye), the national language, and yet called themselves _Les Français_,\r\nand the country France. And as the most enthusiastic and versatile of\r\nthe European commonwealth, they so contrived to lead other nations, and\r\nimpress their fashions on them, that the Eastern races regarded all\r\nEuropeans as Franks, called their country Franghistan, and the patois\r\nspoken by them in the Levant became Lingua Franca.\r\n\r\nFranc, or Franco, was the archbishop of Rouen who made terms with Rollo;\r\nbut the name of real fame arose otherwise.\r\n\r\nLong before the emperor Charles V. had pronounced French to be the\r\nlanguage for men, an Italian merchant of Assisi caused his son,\r\nGiovanni, to be instructed in it as a preparation for commerce. The\r\nboy’s proficiency caused him to be called ‘il Francesco,’ the Frenchman,\r\nuntil the baptismal Giovanni was absolutely forgotten; and as Francesco\r\nhe lived his ascetic, enthusiastic life; as Franciscus was canonized;\r\nand the mendicant order, humbly termed by him _fratres minores_, lesser\r\nbrethren, were known as Franciscans throughout the Western Church.\r\n\r\nMany a little Italian of either sex was christened by his soubriquet,\r\nand though one of the first feminines on record was the unhappy lady\r\nwhose fall and doom Dante made famous, yet the sweet renown of the\r\ndevout housewife, Santa Francesca di Roma, assisted its popularity;\r\nthere was a Françoise at Cambrai even in 1300, and Cecarella is the\r\npeasant mother of a damsel in the Pentamerone.\r\n\r\nSan Francesco di Nola reformed the Franciscans into a new order, called\r\nthe Minimi, or least, as the former ones were the Minores. It is to him\r\nthat the spread of the name beyond the Alps is chiefly owing, for Louise\r\nof Savoy was so devoted to him, that she made him sponsor and\r\nname-father to her passionately loved son, and sewed his winding-sheet\r\nwith her own hands.\r\n\r\nThe name was not absolutely new to France, for that of the grandson of\r\nthe first Montfort, Duke of Brittany, had been Fransez, and so had been\r\nthat of the father of the Duchess Anne, who carried her old Keltic\r\ninheritance to the crown of France; but it was her daughter’s husband,\r\nFrançois I., the godson of the saint of Nola, who was the representative\r\nFrenchman, the type of showy and degenerate chivalry; and thus spread\r\nFrançois and Françoise universally among the French nobility, where they\r\nheld sway almost exclusively till the memories of the House of Valois\r\nhad become detestable; but by that time the populace were making great\r\nuse of it, and at the present time it is considered as so vulgar that a\r\nFrench servant in England was scandalized that a child of the family\r\nshould be called Francis.\r\n\r\nFranz von Sickingen is an instance that already Germany knew the name;\r\nbut it did not take root there at once. The grandchildren of François\r\nI., intermarrying with the house of Lorraine, rendered his namesakes\r\nplentiful, both in the blood-stained younger branch of Guise, and in the\r\ndull direct stem, the continuation of the Karlingen, who at length, by\r\nthe marriage with Maria Theresa, were restored to the throne of\r\nCharlemagne, in the person of him whom the classicalizing Germans termed\r\nFranciskus I. This cumbrous form is still official, but Franz is the\r\nreal name in universal use in the German parts of the Austrian Empire,\r\nthough the Slavonic portions generally use the other end of the word, as\r\nZesk.\r\n\r\nIt was the same gay French monarch who sent us our forms of the name.\r\nMary Tudor, either in gratitude for his kindness, or in memory of her\r\nbrief queenship of France, christened her first child Frances—that Lady\r\nFrances Brandon whose royal blood was so sore a misfortune to her\r\ndaughters, and who had numerous namesakes among the maidens of the Tudor\r\ncourt; but they do not seem to have then made the distinction of letter\r\nthat now marks the feminine, and they used what is now the masculine\r\ncontraction. “Frank, Frank, how long is it since thou wast married to\r\nPrannel?” was the rebuke of the Duke of Richmond to his Howard lady when\r\nhe was pleased to take down her inordinate pride, by reminding her of\r\nher youthful elopement with a vintner.\r\n\r\nThe modern Fanny is apparently of the days of Anne, coming into notice\r\nwith the beautiful Lady Fanny Shirley, who made it a great favourite,\r\nand almost a proverb for prettiness and simplicity, so that the wits of\r\nGeorge II.’s time called John, Lord Hervey, ‘Lord Fanny,’ for his\r\neffeminacy. Fanny, like Frank, is often given at baptism instead of the\r\nfull word; and, by an odd caprice, it has lately been adopted in both\r\nFrance and Germany instead of their national contractions.\r\n\r\nThe masculine came in at the same time, and burst into eminence in the\r\nElizabethan cluster of worthies—Drake, Walsingham, Bacon; but it did not\r\ntake a thorough hold of the nation, and was much left to the Roman\r\nCatholics. It was not till Frank had been restricted to men that it took\r\nhold of the popular mind, so as to become prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe original saint of Assisi made devout Spaniards use Francisco and\r\nFrancisca, before the fresh honour won for the first by two early\r\nJesuits—the Duke of Gandia, the friend and guide of Charles V., and\r\nXavier, the self-devoted apostle of the Indies. His surname has thrown\r\nout another stock. It is in itself Moorish, coming from the Arabic\r\nGa’afar, splendid, the same as that of our old friend, the Giaffar of\r\nthe _Arabian Nights_, the Jaffier of old historians. Wherever Jesuits\r\nhave been, there it is; Savero in Italy, Xavier in France, Xaverie in\r\nWallachia, Xavery in Poland, Saverij in Illyria; Xaveria for the\r\nfeminine in Roman Catholic Germany, marking the course of the\r\ncounter-Reformation. Even Ireland deals in Saverius, or Savy, though\r\nwhen English sailors meet a Spanish negro called Xaver, they call him\r\nShaver! Savary de Bohnn, whom Dugdale places under Henry I., was\r\nprobably a form of Sigeheri, or Saher, which may have been absorbed by\r\nXaver in Roman Catholic lands.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │     Erse.     │    Breton.    │    French.    │\r\n   │Francis        │Fromsais       │Franse         │François       │\r\n   │Frank          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │   Italian.    │  Wallachian.  │\r\n   │Francisco      │Francisco      │Francesco      │Francisk       │\r\n   │Francilo       │Francisquinho  │Franco         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Cecco          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Dutch.     │    Scotch.    │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Franciskus     │Frenz          │Francie        │Frans          │\r\n   │Franz          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Frank          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │    Slovak.    │   Lettish.    │\r\n   │Franciszek     │Frantisek      │Francisek      │Spranzis       │\r\n   │Franck         │               │Franc          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Franjo         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Zesk           │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Lithuanian.  │     Finn.     │  Hungarian.   │    Greek.     │\r\n   │Prancas        │Ranssu         │Ferencz        │Φραγκίσκος     │\r\n   │               │               │Ferko          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    Breton.    │    French.    │Span. and Por. │\r\n   │Frances        │Franseza       │Françoise      │Francisca      │\r\n   │Fanny          │Fantik         │Francisque     │               │\r\n   │               │               │Fanchette      │               │\r\n   │               │               │Fanchon        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │    German.    │    Dutch.     │    Polish     │\r\n   │Francesca      │Franziske      │Francyntje     │Franciszka     │\r\n   │Cecca          │Franze         │Francina       │Franulka       │\r\n   │Ceccina        │Sprinzchen     │Fransje        │Franusia       │\r\n   │Ceccarella     │(Lower German.)│               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Bohemian.   │    Slovak.    │  Hungarian.   │    Greek.     │\r\n   │Frantiska      │Franciska      │Francziska     │Φραγκίσκη[109] │\r\n   │               │Franika        │               │               │\r\n   │               │Franja         │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  ‘We-we’ is the name now given by the South Sea Islanders to the\r\n  French.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Munch; Munter; Michaelis; Alban Butler; Mrs. Rusk, _German\r\n  Empire_; Dugdale; Ellis, _Domesday_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION V.—_Thor._\r\n\r\nThe third in the Teutonic Triad is the mighty Thor, whose image stood on\r\nthe other side of that of Odin, in the northern temples, whose day\r\nfollowed Odin’s, and who was the special deity of the Norsemen, as\r\nWuotan was of the Saxons, and Freyr of the Swedes.\r\n\r\nThe most awful phenomenon to which, in Northern Europe, human ears are\r\naccustomed—the great electric sound from heaven, could not fail to be\r\nconnected with divinity, by nature, as well as by the lingering\r\nreminiscence of the revelations, when it accompanied the Voice of the\r\nMost High.\r\n\r\nIf the classic nations knew the mighty roll as the bolts of Zeus or\r\nJupiter, they called it βροντή (_brontè_) and _tonitru_, names\r\ncorresponding to those divinities wherewith the other Aryans connected\r\nthe sound—the Perun of the Slavonians, the Taran of the Cymry, the\r\nThunnr, Donnar, or Thor of the Teuton. The Indra of the Hindu, came from\r\n_udra_ or _eidan_, water, as god of the waters of the sky, while the\r\nTeutonic title was probably an imitation of the deep rolling sound, and\r\nthe god must have been called after it.\r\n\r\nIn the northern myths Thor is the eldest son of Odin, mightiest of all\r\nthe Aasir, partly in right of his belt of strength, which doubles his\r\nforce, and of the iron gauntlets which he wields whenever he throws his\r\nmighty hammer—Mjolner, the crusher (from the word that named Milo, also\r\nmills and meal)—which, like a boomerang, always returns to him when he\r\nhas hurled it. He has a palace called Thrudheim, or Thrudvangr, the\r\nabode of courage, resting on five hundred and forty pillars, which seems\r\nlike a tradition of some many-columned Indian edifice. It was he who was\r\nforemost in the fight with the powers of evil; he bound Lok, the\r\ndestroyer, and banished him to Utgard, where the famous visit was made\r\nthat so curiously reflects Indian and Persian myths, and has dwindled\r\ninto the tricks of our Giant-killer and the German _schneiderlein_. He\r\nhas more adventures than any other single deity in northern story, and\r\ncontinues champion of the gods till the final consummation, when, after\r\nhaving destroyed many of the enemies, he is finally stifled by the flood\r\nof poison emitted by the Midgard snake.\r\n\r\nThord seems to have been a contraction of the old Low German Donarad,\r\nwhich has vanished; but in fact Thor, though regnant in the North, was\r\nnot very popular elsewhere, and almost all the names he commences are\r\nScandinavian; though the old Spanish Goths had a king Thorismundo,\r\nThor’s protection, the same as our Norman Tormund. They had also an\r\nAsturian bishop, Toribio, who long after was followed by a sainted\r\nnamesake in Spanish South America.\r\n\r\nEvery possible change that could be rung on Thor seems to have been in\r\nuse among the Northmen. The simplest masculine, Thordr, comes seventy\r\ntimes in the _Landnama-bok_, Thorer forty-seven times, after the early\r\nsettler Thorer the silent, and the feminine Thora twenty-two, and she\r\nstill flourishes in Iceland and Norway.\r\n\r\nThor had his elf, Thoralfr, his household spirit Thordis, his bear and\r\nhis wolf. His bear, Thorbjorn, is fifty-one times in the Iceland roll,\r\nand was not without a she-bear, Thorbera; and the ‘Torbern,’ in\r\nDomesday, was doubtless the father of the family of Thorburn. Indeed,\r\nthough Thor’s hammer was not an artistic one, he has had other artist\r\nnamesakes by inheritance, namely, the Flemish Terburg, an offshoot from\r\nthe northern Thorbergr, with its feminine Thorbjorg, or Thorberga, and\r\nthe great Danish Thorwaldsen, the son of Thorvalldr, Thor’s power, or\r\nmaybe of thunder-welder, the Thorwald of Germany, and Thorold or Turold\r\nof the Norman Conquest. Readers of Andersen may remember his story of\r\nthe boy-sculptor mortified by the consequential little girl declaring\r\nthat no one whose name ended in _sen_ was worth speaking to. Thorwald,\r\ntoo, was one of the old Icelandic discoverers of America.\r\n\r\nAs to Thor’s wolf, Thorolf, it is contracted into Tolv in Norway, and\r\nthus may be the origin of that curious Danish superstition that at\r\nnoon-day (twelve being _tolv_ in Danish) Kong Tolv, a terrific and\r\nmysterious personage, drives by in his chariot, invisible except to\r\nmaidens inadvertently left in solitude, when they are borne off by him\r\nto his domains for seven years, which pass like a single day.\r\n\r\nForty-two Thorarinns, as well as a Thorarna for a feminine, assisted to\r\npeople Iceland, and of course Thor’s sword, spear, and kettle were there\r\ntoo; Thorbrandr six times over. The spear and kettle figure again in the\r\nstory of Croyland Abbey, as told by Ingulf. Turgar, the little child who\r\nescaped the destruction, is no doubt Thorgeir, and it may be feared thus\r\nbetrays a Norman invention; but Turcetyl, the good man who re-built it,\r\nwas really Ethelstane’s chancellor, and no doubt took his name from some\r\nof the invading Danes, who called the Thorketyl or Thorkjell of the\r\nNorth, Thurkil or Trukill, of which we have some traces remaining in the\r\nname Thurkell. Thorkatla was the Icelandic feminine.\r\n\r\nIt is an evidence how greatly our population was leavened by the Danes,\r\nthat though Thor names are very rare in Anglo-Saxon history, we have\r\nmany among our surnames, such as Thurlow from Thorleik, Thor’s sport,\r\nTunstall and Tunstan from Thurstan, the Danish Thorstein, the proper\r\nform of Thor’s stone, who is thus the ‘stainless Tunstall,’ whose\r\n‘banner white’ waved in Flodden Field, just as long before Tostain the\r\nwhite had been the foremost knight at Hastings, and left his name to the\r\nnorthern peasantry to be confounded with Toussaint, the popular reading\r\nof All Saints' day, and thus to pass to the negro champion of Hayti,\r\nToussaint L'Ouverture.\r\n\r\nThorgils, Thor’s pledge, also runs into Thurkil or Trokil, and cuts down\r\nto Troels; but coming to the Western Isles has there continued in the\r\nform of Torquil, and has been mixed up with the idea of the Latin\r\n_torques_, a neck chain. The Swedes call it Thyrgils, and the feminine\r\nis Thorgisla. It is Torchil in Domesday.\r\n\r\nWhite Thors were Thorfinn and Thorfinna; Thorvid, or Thor’s wood, is in\r\nDenmark Truvid, Truid, Trudt, probably our Truefit. Besides these were\r\nused—\r\n\r\n  Thorbert, Thor’s splendour (Torbertus in Domesday).\r\n  Thorgautr, Thor the good (or Goth).\r\n  Thorgerdur, Thor’s protection (thirty-seven in _Landnama-bok_).\r\n  Thorgestur, Thor’s guest.\r\n  Thorgrim, Thor the helmeted.\r\n  Thorgunna, Thor’s war.\r\n  Thorhildr, Thor’s battle-maid.\r\n  Thorleif, Thor’s relic.\r\n  Thormod, Thor’s mood.\r\n  Thorhalla, Thor’s stone.\r\n  Thorlaug, Thor’s liquor.[110]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  _Landnama-bok_; Thierry, _Conquête d'Angleterre_; Ellis, _Domesday_;\r\n  Munch; Mallet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION VI.—_Baldur and Hodur._\r\n\r\nMost beautiful of all the gods was Baldur, the fair white god, mild,\r\nbeautiful, and eloquent,—beloved but fore-doomed to death. His story is\r\nwell known. His mother, Frigga, vainly took an oath of all created\r\nthings not to be the instrument of his fate,—she omitted the mistletoe;\r\nand Lok, the destroyer, having, in the guise of a sympathetic old woman,\r\nbeguiled her into betraying her omission, placed a shaft of the magic\r\nplant in the hands of the blind god, Hodr, when all the Aasir were in\r\nsport directing their harmless weapons against the breast of their\r\nfavourite. Baldur was slain, and his beautiful wife, Nanna, died of\r\ngrief for his loss. Even then Hela would have relented, and have given\r\nhim back, provided every living thing would have wept for him; but one\r\nstern giantess among the rocks refused her tears, and Baldur remains in\r\nthe realms of death, until after all his brethren shall have perished in\r\nthe last great conflict, when with them he shall be revivified in the\r\ntimes of the restitution of all things, so remarkably promised in these\r\nancient myths.\r\n\r\nAs to the source of his name, authorities are not agreed. Baldr is a\r\nprince in several Teutonic languages, and the royal family of the\r\nVisigoths were the Balten. Balths, bald, bold, is also a word among\r\nthem; but Grimm deduces the god’s title from _bjel_, or _baltas_, the\r\nword that is the first syllable of the Slavonic Belisarius, and thus\r\nwould make the Anglian Baldœg mean bright as day. It is the word that\r\nlies at the root of _bellus_, pretty, whose derivations are now so\r\nuniversal in Romanized Europe. Others turn the name over to the Bel, or\r\nBeli, of the Kelts, or the Eastern Belus; but on the whole, the\r\nderivation Baldr, a prince, is the least unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe legend seems to have been unknown to the German races, or, at least,\r\nno trace of it has been found, and the names that constantly occur\r\nbeginning and ending with _bald_ or _pald_, are supposed merely to mean\r\nprince, and not to refer to the god. As an end it is more common than as\r\na beginning, and it is peculiar to the Anglian races, our own\r\nAnglo-Saxons, the inhabitants of the Low Countries, and continental\r\nSaxons. The names that have become universal all emanated from one or\r\nother of these sources.\r\n\r\nBaldric, or prince ruler, was Anglo-Saxon; but the Swedes learned it as\r\nBalderik, the Poles as Balderyk, the French as Baudri. Baldred, an\r\nEnglish-named saint, was bishop of Glasgow; thence, too, the early\r\nFrench took Baldramn, prince raven, which they made Baudrand, and\r\nconfused with Baldrand, prince of the house, also Baldemar, famous\r\nprince, unless this is a confusion with Waldemar.\r\n\r\nThe most general of these was, however, Baldwine, princely friend, who\r\nwas very early a feudatory of the empire in Flanders, and the name\r\ncontinued in his family, so as to take strong hold of the population,\r\nand to spread into the adjoining lands. Baldwin was the father of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror’s Matilda, and the one Baldwinus before the\r\nConquest has very considerably multiplied after it, so that to us\r\nBaldwin has all the associations of a Norman name. Its European\r\ncelebrity was owing to the two knights of Lorraine and Bourg, who\r\nreigned successively at Jerusalem after the first Crusade, and left this\r\nto be considered as the appropriate Christian name in their short-lived\r\ndynasty; and again, it was borne by the unfortunate count who was thrust\r\ninto the old Byzantine throne only to be demolished by the Bulgarians,\r\nor if indeed he ever returned, to be disowned as an impostor by his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  German.   │   Dutch.   │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Baldwin     │Baudouin    │Balduin     │Boudewijn   │Baldovino   │\r\n   │            │Baudoin     │            │            │Balduino    │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Germans have Baldo, the French Baud, both contractions from either\r\nBaldwin or Balderich, and there are a good many surnames therefrom in\r\nEngland, France, and Germany.\r\n\r\nExamples of Baldegisel, prince pledge, Baldbrecht, Baldemund,\r\nBaldeflede, Baldetrude, have also been found, but nowhere are any such\r\nforms prevalent.\r\n\r\nBaldur’s wife, Nanna, probably comes from _nanthjan_, in Gothic, to be\r\ncourageous. There are a few Frisians called Nanno, Nanne, Nonne; but it\r\nis very probable that this old goddess may have contributed to furnish\r\nsome of the inherited names now all absorbed in Anne.\r\n\r\nBaldur’s unfortunate murderer has, strange to say, many more namesakes.\r\nHe was Nanna’s brother, blind, and of amazing strength, and is supposed\r\nto typify unheeding rashness and violence, in opposition to prudent\r\nvalour. His name is in Gothic Hathus, in old German Hadu, and in\r\nAnglo-Saxon Headho, and is said to come from _headho_, an attack or\r\nfight, so that the right way to translate it in the compounds would be\r\nby fierce when it begins the name—war when it forms the conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt has a great many different forms. The old northern Hedinn is believed\r\nto be one, belonging first to a semi-fabulous sea-king of the mythic\r\nages, who tried to elope with the Valkyr Hildur. From him the sea was\r\npoetically called, in the strange affected versification of the North,\r\nthe road of Hedinn’s horses. There were eight Hedinns in the\r\n_Landnama-bok_, and the word sometimes occurred at the end of the name,\r\nas with Skarphedinn, the fierce but generous son of Njal, who dies\r\nsinging to the last in the flame, with his faithful axe driven deep into\r\nthe wall that the fire might not spoil its edge.\r\n\r\nTacitus mentions two chiefs whom he calls Catumer and Catualda, and who\r\nare supposed to be by interpretation Hadumar, or fierce fame, and\r\nHadupald, or Haduwald, each of which would be fierce prince. Hadumar has\r\nlingered in southern France, where it has become Azimar, or Adhémar, the\r\nlast, the well-known surname of the Grignan family. Hadubrand, fierce\r\nsword, is one of the heroes of the most ancient existing poem in Low\r\nGerman. Heddo is to be found as a name of some Frisians, contracted\r\neither from this, or from Hadubert, or one of the other compounds. Even\r\nladies were named by this affix, as Haduburg, war protection; Hadulint,\r\nwar serpent; Haduwig, which the old German name-writer, Luther, makes\r\nwar refuge.\r\n\r\nThis last is the only usual form, owing to the saintly fame of a\r\ndaughter of the Markgraf of Meranie. While one daughter, Agnes, was the\r\nvictim of Philippe Auguste’s irregular marriage, the happier Haduwig\r\nmarried a duke of Silesia, and shared his elevation to the throne of\r\nPoland, where she evinced such piety as to be canonized; and the name\r\nshe left was borne by a Polish lady in the next century, who converted\r\nher husband, the Duke of Lithuania. Thus doubly sainted, all eastern\r\nGermany delighted in it, and the French sent it to us; they calling it\r\nHedvige; we took it as Hawoyse, and, descending into Avice, or Avis, it\r\nwas at one time very common here, and is to be found in almost every old\r\nregister.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Havoise        │Hedvige        │Hedwig         │Jadviga        │\r\n   │Hawoyse        │   —————————   │Hedda          │               │\r\n   │Havoisia       │   Italian.    │               │               │\r\n   │Avice          │Edvige         │               │               │\r\n   │Avicia         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Avis           │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Lusatian.   │     Esth.     │     Lett.     │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Hada           │Eddo           │Edde           │Hedviga        │\r\n   │               │Edo            │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Goths, too, had their compounds of Hadu. The Lady Adosinda,\r\nwhom Southey has placed collecting the corpses of her family in the\r\nruins of the city destroyed by the Moors, is Haduswinth, or fierce\r\nstrength; and the Portuguese Affonso is from Hadufuns. This last\r\nsyllable, namely _funs_, means vehemence, and is, in fact, no other than\r\nour own undignified _fuss_; Affonso, Afonso, thus mean fierce fuss,\r\nthough for more euphony, this lofty name of kings may be made into\r\nwarlike impetuosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION VII.—_Tyr._\r\n\r\nIn Northern mythology Tyr is another son of Odin, and god of strength\r\nand victory. When, in the great fight with the powers of evil, the\r\nterrible Fenris, the wolf of the abyss, was to be bound with a fetter,\r\nslender, but which no power could break, he was only induced to stand\r\nstill by Tyr’s volunteering to put his right hand into the monster’s\r\nmouth, as a pledge of the good faith of Asgard. Finding himself chained,\r\nthe wolf at once closed his jaws, and bit off Tyr’s hand; nevertheless,\r\nthe Runic letter Λ (_thorn_, the sound of _dh_), which was left-handed,\r\nlike the god, and therefore his sign, was esteemed the mark of truth and\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nTyr has few namesakes. Tyre and Thyra, in the North, are the only direct\r\nones; but it sometimes finishes a word, as in the case of Angantyr,\r\nfavourite of Tyr, the warrior who obtained the terrible sword, Tyrfing,\r\nforged by the dwarfs, which did, indeed, always give victory, but which\r\nwould never go back into its scabbard till it had been fed with, at\r\nleast, one human life. The _dio_, or _thius_, of the old Gothic and\r\nGerman names thus arose, such as Alathius, the Latinized Halltyr, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nNiörd was god of the sea, almost equal in rank to Odin himself. He was a\r\nvery ancient deity, known to the German nations as Nairthus, and\r\nprobably, like Freyr, male and female. The goddess Nerthus, mentioned by\r\nTacitus, has been supposed by Grimm to mean Niörd; but Hermann Luning\r\nmakes it Törd, a wife of Odin, and one of the three titles of the earth:\r\nat any rate, out of this mention has been made a goddess—Hertha, who has\r\nnot been without namesakes.\r\n\r\nMany derivations have been suggested for his name. Finn Magnusson\r\nthought it might be cognate with the Greek νηρὸς (neros), wet; Grimm,\r\nthat it might be connected with the _North_, though he declines to speak\r\npositively; and Hermann Luning deduces it from _nairan_, to join,\r\nbecause the sea joins the land together.\r\n\r\nNiörd’s direct derivatives seem to be Nordhilda and Nordbert; the last\r\nfashionable in Germany, from a youth of imperial family, who was, at the\r\nend of the eleventh century, brought to serious thoughts by having his\r\nhorse struck by lightning under him, when, like St. Paul, he cried out\r\n“What wouldst Thou have me to do?” He became a monk, and was afterwards\r\narchbishop of Magdeburg, and founder of the Præmonstratensian Order; and\r\nNorbert became known and used after he was canonized.\r\n\r\nNiörd is used in the North; and thence too, perhaps, comes Norman, which\r\nwas in use, both in France and England, at the time of the Conquest. It\r\nis puzzling to find in Domesday Book sixteen Normans possessing land in\r\nEngland before the Conquest, and only eight after it—one of whom, Norman\r\nd'Arcie, at least, was a Norman born. Afterwards, during the friendly\r\nthirteenth century, English nobles carried Norman to Scotland, where it\r\nwas adopted in the Leslie family, and, like Nigel, became exclusively\r\nScottish. The Highlanders called it Tormaid, which is considered to be\r\nreally its Gaelic form, not an equivalent. The last Englishman I have\r\nfound so called was Norman de Verdun, under Edward I.\r\n\r\nThe story of Niörd’s marriage is one of the wildest tales of later Norse\r\nmythology. Iduna, the wife of Bragi, god of poetry, kept the apples of\r\ngold which renewed the youth of the gods. However, Loki, having fallen\r\ninto the clutches of the great frost giant, Thiassi, in the form of an\r\neagle, only effected his release by promising to bring Iduna and her\r\napples to Jotunheim. He beguiled her into a forest, under pretence that\r\nhe had found finer apples than her own, and there Thiassi flew away with\r\nher. The gods began to grow old without their apples, and insisted that\r\nLoki should bring her back. He arrayed himself as a falcon, and, flying\r\nto Jotunheim, turned Iduna into a sparrow and flew home with her,\r\npursued by Thiassi. The Aasir, seeing her danger, lighted a fire with\r\nchips on the walls of Asgard, which flamed up and singed Thiassi’s\r\nwings, so that he fell down among them and was slain. Afterwards, his\r\ndaughter, Skadi, came to avenge his death, but was mollified by being\r\nallowed to choose a husband from the Aasir, however was only allowed the\r\nsight of the feet to select from; and thus, hoping she had taken Baldur,\r\nshe obtained Niörd. Thiassi’s eyes are said to have become stars; but,\r\nas usual, the northern astronomy has been ruined by the classical, and\r\nno one knows which they are.\r\n\r\nBragi was followed as an Icelandic name. Its etymology is uncertain;\r\nsome make it cognate with Brahma; others with _braga_, to shine; others\r\nwith _brain_. Braga was poetry, and thence, from the manner of recital,\r\nnoun, has formed the uncomplimentary verb, to _brag_, and the\r\n_braggart_.\r\n\r\nIduna, or more properly, Idhuna, Ithuna, is a myth of spring reft away\r\nby winter, who dies of the warmth of the flame of the summer gods. Her\r\nname does not seem to have been adopted in the North; but it is almost\r\ncertainly the origin of Idonea, which is very common in old English\r\npedigrees. Idonea de Camville lived under Henry III.; Idonea de\r\nVetriponte, Vieuxpont, or Oldbridge, is cited in the curious tracts on\r\nNorthern curiosities, put forth some years back in Durham, which say the\r\nname is very common; and though it might be the feminine of the Latin\r\n_idoneus_ (fit), its absence in the Romance countries may be taken as an\r\nindication that it was a mere classicalizing of the northern goddess of\r\nthe apples of youth.\r\n\r\nThe word itself is translated by Luning in the most satisfactory manner\r\nas ‘she who works incessantly,’ and by Munch, as ‘she who renovates\r\nincessantly.’ _Idja_ is to work, _unna_, love, so that others make her\r\none who loves work. The word _unna_, however, though derived from the\r\nverb _an unna_, to love, has come to mean only a woman, and as such is\r\nfrequently used as a termination, as well as now and then standing alone\r\nas a female name, Unna, of whom there are three in the _Landnama-bok_,\r\nand several in the Saga of _Burnt Njal_.\r\n\r\nUna is likewise used in both Ireland and the North; but in the former it\r\nis said to mean famine; in the North it is most probably from that word\r\n_vin_, _win_, or _wine_, a friend, which we shall often meet with again,\r\nand which lies most likely at the root of _unna_.\r\n\r\nThe word _idja_, to work, the first syllable of Iduna’s name, formed\r\n_deisi_, activity, and thence the person who ought to be active, the old\r\nGerman _itis_, and Anglo-Saxon _ides_, a woman, in the North, _deis_ or\r\n_dis_. The idea of the active sprite was divided between womankind and\r\ncertain household spirits, like the Roman genii, only feminine and\r\npossibly another name for the Nornir, as each man had his own, and they\r\nwere sometimes visible as animals suiting with the character of their\r\nprotégés: powerful chiefs had bears or bulls, crafty ones foxes; and\r\neven on the introduction of Christianity, faith in the Disir was not\r\nabandoned, though there were no more sacrifices at their _Disir salen_,\r\nor temples. Sometimes a family would have various _disir_ at war with\r\none another, some for the old faith, some for the new. While Iceland was\r\nstill in suspense between heathenism and Christianity, a young chieftain\r\none night heard three knocks at his door, and despite the warnings of a\r\nseer, went forth to see the cause. He beheld nine women in black riding\r\nfrom the North, and nine from the South, the _disir_ of his family, the\r\nblack for heathendom, the white for Christianity. The black ones,\r\nknowing that they must vanish from the land, seized his life as their\r\nlast tribute, and wounded him so that he returned a dying man to tell\r\nhis tale. Probably these _disir_ are either the cause or the effect of\r\nthose strange phantoms which, whether of doves, dogs, heads, children,\r\nor women, portend death in certain families. They may likewise account\r\nfor some of the family bearings in the form of animals.\r\n\r\nDisa is a Norwegian and Icelandic name, now nearly disused: it is also a\r\nvery frequent termination, such as in Thordis, Alfdis, Freydis, &c., and\r\nit may be most fitly translated as the sprite giving the idea of the\r\nguardian protecting spirit that woman should be. In the German names it\r\nappears as the termination _itis_ or _idis_, as Adelidis, one that\r\nappears at first sight like a mere Latinism.[111]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Luning; Munter; Munch; Blackwell, Mallet; Ellis, _Domesday_;\r\n  Dugdale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VIII.—_Heimdall._\r\n\r\nThe porter of Valhall is Heimdall, the son of nine sisters, who watches\r\nat the further end of the rainbow-bridge Bifrost to guard the Æsir from\r\nthe giants. He sleeps more lightly than a bird, can see a hundred\r\nleagues by day or night, and can hear the grass growing in the fields,\r\nand the wool on the sheep’s backs. He bears in one hand a sword, in the\r\nother a trumpet, the sound of which resounds throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen the powers of evil break loose, Heimdall will rouse the gods to\r\ntheir last conflict by a blast of his trumpet, and in the struggle will\r\nkill and be killed by Loki.\r\n\r\nHis name is explained by _heim_, home, and _dallr_, powerful. The latter\r\nhalf is in Anglo-Saxon _deall_, in old High German _tello_, and in the\r\nold Norse _dallr_, whence Dalla is found as a name in the\r\n_Landnama-bok_.\r\n\r\n_Heim_ is in Ulfilas both a field and a village, and the Anglo-Saxons\r\nuse the word _dhăm_ for an enclosure, and _hām_ for a village; _ham_ in\r\na similar manner, as is still shown in the diminutive, hamlet, for a\r\nsmall village, as well as in the _ham_ that concludes many local names.\r\nAt the same time, the word, slightly altered, assumed that closer,\r\ndearer, warmer sense which is expressed by the terms, _heim_, _hiemme_,\r\n_hjem_, _hame_, and _home_, in all the faithful-hearted Teutonic race,\r\nyet which is so little comprehended by our southern relatives, that they\r\nabsolutely have no power of expressing such an idea as “It’s hame, and\r\nit’s hame, and it’s hame.”\r\n\r\nEven in their heathenism “true to the kindred points of heaven and\r\nhome,” the guardian of the dwelling of the brave spirits of the dead was\r\nmade by the Northmen no grim Cerberus nor gloomy Charon, but the _Home_\r\nruler.\r\n\r\nAnd though Heimdall nowhere occurs as a name, yet the old German\r\nHeimirich is almost identical with it; though it should be observed that\r\n_heim_ is a commencement peculiar to the Germans; we never find a name\r\nwith this first syllable originating either with the Northmen or the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nWhere Heimirich first began does not appear, but it sprung into fame\r\nwith the Saxon emperor called the Fowler, and his descendant won the\r\nhonours of a saint, whence this became a special favourite in Germany,\r\nwhere it was borne by six emperors, by princes innumerable, and by so\r\nmany others that the contraction Heintz had already passed to cats when\r\n_Reinecke Fuchs_ was written.\r\n\r\nIt is from the endearment, Heinz, that, the handsome and unfortunate son\r\nof Frederick II, who, after his brief royalty in Sardinia, spent the\r\nrest of his life in a Genoese prison, was known to Italy as Enzio, and\r\nto history as Enzius.\r\n\r\nFrom the Kaisers, the third Capetian king of France was christened\r\nHenri, a form always frequent there, though only four times on the\r\nthrone. Its popularity culminated during the religious wars, when Henri\r\nde Valois, Henri de Bourbon, and Henri de Guise were fighting the war of\r\nthe three Henris; but in spite of the French love and pride in _le grand\r\nmonarque_, the growing devotion to St. Louis, from whom the Bourbon\r\nrights to the throne were derived, set Henri aside from being the royal\r\nname, until the birth of him whom legitimists still call Henri V.\r\n\r\nThere are but three instances of ‘Henricus,’ even after the Conquest, in\r\nDomesday; and it must have been from the reigning French monarch that\r\nWilliam the Conqueror took Henry for his youngest son, from whom the\r\nfirst Plantagenet King received and transmitted it to his ungracious\r\nson, his feeble grandson, and through him to the elder House of\r\nLancaster, then to the younger, who for three generations wore it on the\r\nthrone, and for whose sake it was revived in the House of Tudor. Its\r\nright native shape is Harry; the other form is only an imitation of\r\nFrench spelling. It was ‘Harry of Winchester’ who cried out for help at\r\nEvesham; Harry of Bolingbroke who rode triumphant into London, and who\r\ndied worn out in the Jerusalem chamber; Harry Hotspur whose spur was\r\ncold at Shrewsbury; Harry of Monmouth who was Hal in his haunts at\r\nEastcheap, and jested with Fluellen on the eve of Agincourt; Harry of\r\nWindsor who foretold the exaltation of Harry Tudor when “Richmond was a\r\nlittle peevish boy,” and Harry VIII., or bluff King Hal, who lives in\r\nthe popular mind as an English Blue Beard; perhaps connected in some\r\ncases with the popular soubriquet of the devil.\r\n\r\nAn early Swedish bishop bore the name, and so did a bishop of Iceland\r\nbefore the twelfth century; but these must have been foreigners, for\r\nthere are no other instances in the North in early times, though the\r\ngeneral fusion of European names brought in Hendrik, to the loss of the\r\nnative Heidrick, just as Heinrich seems to have in Germany destroyed an\r\nindependent Haginrich.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Henry          │Henri          │Enrique        │Enrico         │\r\n   │Harry          │Henriot        │               │Arrigo         │\r\n   │Hal            │   ————————    │   ————————    │Enzio          │\r\n   │Halkin         │    Breton.    │  Portuguese.  │Arriguccio     │\r\n   │Hawkin         │Hery           │Enrique        │Arrigozzo      │\r\n   │               │               │               │Guccio         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Dutch.     │    Danish.    │   Frisian.    │\r\n   │Heimirich      │Hendrik        │Hendrik        │Enrik          │\r\n   │Heinrich       │Hendricus      │   ————————    │   ————————    │\r\n   │Hein           │Heintje        │   Swedish.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Heine          │               │Henrik         │Henryk         │\r\n   │Heinz          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Heinecke       │               │               │               │\r\n   │Henke          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Henning        │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Bohemian.   │     Lett.     │  Lithuanian.  │               │\r\n   │Jindrich       │Indrikis       │Endrikis       │               │\r\n   │               │Indes          │Endruttis      │               │\r\n   │               │Induls         │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Henrietta      │Henriette      │Enriqueta      │Henrika        │\r\n   │Harriet        │   ————————    │   ————————    │   ————————    │\r\n   │Harriot        │   Italian.    │  Portuguese.  │    German.    │\r\n   │Harty          │Enrichetta     │Henriqueta     │Henriette      │\r\n   │Hatty          │               │               │Jette          │\r\n   │Etta           │               │               │               │\r\n   │Hetty          │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Portuguese kingdom was a Henri from Burgundy; but the\r\nname did not greatly flourish in the Peninsula till Enrique of\r\nTrastamare climbed to the Castilian throne, and his namesakes,\r\nalternating with Juan, threw out the old national Alfonso and Fernando.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this is one of the most universal of Teutonic names, and\r\none of the most English in use, although not Anglian in origin. The\r\nfeminine seems to have been invented in the sixteenth century, probably\r\nin France, for Henriet Stuart appears in the House of Stuart d'Aubigné\r\nin 1588, and there were some Henriettes to match the Henris at the court\r\nof Catherine de Medicis. England received the name from the daughter of\r\nHenri IV., Henriette Marie, whom the Prayer Book called Queen Mary,\r\nthough her godchildren were always Henrietta, so Latinized by their\r\npedigrees, though in real life they went by the queen’s French\r\nappellation, as well as English lips could frame it, so that Hawyot was\r\nformerly the universal pronunciation of Harriet, and is still\r\noccasionally used.\r\n\r\nHeimo, or Hamo, is another old German form, becoming in French Hamon,\r\nHaymon, Aymon; and Amone in Italian. _Les Quatre Filz Aymon_ were\r\nnotable freebooters in Karling romance, and in Italy were _i Quattro\r\nFigli d'Amone_. Early Norman times gave us Hamo, Hamelin, and Fitzaymon;\r\nbut except for an occasional Hamlyn in an old pedigree, they have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nGermany had Heimrod, Heimbert, and Heimfred; but these are not easy to\r\ndisentangle from the derivatives of the word _hun_, which are much more\r\nin use.[112]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  Michaelis; Pott; _Edda_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION IX.—_Will._\r\n\r\nThis section has thus been headed because the Will was one of the ideas\r\nmost strongly expressed in various forms in the religion of the\r\nhigh-spirited North.\r\n\r\nThe word _to will_ is of all tongues; the Greek βουλή, Latin _velle_ or\r\n_volo_, Gothic _viljan_, Keltic _iouli_, all show a common origin, and\r\nevery Teuton language has the derivatives of _will_, just as the Romance\r\nhave of _volo_.\r\n\r\nBut it is the Teuton who brings the Will into his mythology. When the\r\ncreation began, the cow Audumbla licked out of the stones a man named\r\nBur, who was the grandfather of the three primeval gods, Odin, Wili, and\r\nVê, the All-pervading, the Will, the Holy; and it was these who together\r\nanimated the first human pair. We hear no more of Vili or Hœmir, as he\r\nis also called after he thus infused feeling and will into the first\r\nman; but we meet the word _will_ again forming _valjan_, to choose,\r\n_velja_ in the North.\r\n\r\nThence the home where Odin welcomed his brave descendants was Valhall,\r\nthe hall of the chosen; and the maidens who chose the happy who were\r\nthere to dwell, were the Valkyrier, or Walcyrge, the last syllable from\r\n_kjöra_, or _curen_, to choose, the word whence an electoral prince is\r\ncalled in German, Kürfurst. But the passport to the hall of the chosen\r\nwas a glorious death on the battle-field; and thus it was that _val_,\r\n_vali_, _wali_, belonged to the carnage of the fight, since slaughter\r\ndid but seal the marks of the Valkyr upon the brave, whose spirits were\r\npassing over the rainbow-arch, while the comets marked the course of the\r\nchariot which glanced across the sky with weapons forged for their sport\r\nin battle and chase.\r\n\r\nSo the Hall of the Chosen became the Hall of Carnage, the abode of the\r\nslain; and it is remarkable that no Christian writer transfers the term\r\nto Paradise, although the epithet Schildburg, the castle of shields, is\r\nonce applied to Heaven as the home of the victors. Indeed, Valhall was\r\nnot eternal; the warrior there admitted had yet to fight his last fight\r\nby Odin’s side, perish with him and his sons, and share with them the\r\nrenovation of the universe. So deeply interwoven in the ideas of the\r\nNorth was a violent death with the hope of bliss, that crags in Norway\r\naffording scope for a desperate leap, were called the vestibule of\r\nValhall, and the preference for a death on the battle-field lingered\r\ninto Christian days, so that not only did fierce Earl Siward bemoan his\r\nfate in dying of sickness, albeit he rose upon his feet to draw his last\r\nbreath, but even the Chevalier Bayard mourned angrily over the fever\r\nthat had nearly caused him to pass away like a sick girl in his bed.\r\n\r\nWell then might the Valkyrier be the favoured messengers of Odin, sent\r\nforth to select the champions who should become the guests of their\r\nmighty forefather, himself called Valfreyr, or Slaughter Lord. They\r\nhovered over the camp in armour with swan wings, marked those who were\r\nto fall, and wove the web of slaughter ere the battle began. Their\r\nnumber varies in different sagas, and so do their names, although Hildur\r\nis always the chief. Their last appearance was when the islander of\r\nCaithness beheld the twelve weaving their grisly web in a loom of\r\nlances, the weights of men’s heads, on the eve of the Good Friday of the\r\nbattle of Clontarf, between King Sigtrygg and Brian Boromhe, singing the\r\nweird song that Gray translated long before Teutonic antiquities were\r\nrevived:\r\n\r\n                  “Horror covers all the heath,\r\n                    Clouds of carnage blot the sun:\r\n                  Sisters, weave the web of death;\r\n                    Sisters, cease, the work is done.”\r\n\r\nThe work done, the web was torn in sunder, and divided between the\r\nValkyrier, who flew off, half to the North, half to the South, denoting\r\nthe rending of the ancient faith.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in later sagas, the _Valkyrier_ lose their wild mystery and\r\ndivinity, and fall into mere magic maidens, sometimes with extraordinary\r\nstrength, sometimes with swan wings, and, at the very last gasp of the\r\nsupernatural, with goose feet, which at their next step become merely\r\nlarge feet. The mother of Charlemagne absolutely makes the transition\r\nfrom Bertha the goose-footed, to Berthe _aux grands pieds_.\r\n\r\nTo this source probably may be referred Wala or wise woman, the inspired\r\npriestess, also called in ancient German the Velleda. Cæsar tells us\r\nthat the matrons among the Germans cast lots, and prophesied the issue\r\nof battle, and thus Wala may have been the wise or inspired woman. The\r\ngreat prophetic song of the fate of the Aasir is _Voluspa_, either the\r\nwise woman’s spae, or the inspired spae or prophecy; for _vola_ or\r\n_volur_ means inspired in ancient German (no doubt from the _wala_ or\r\nprophetess), and by a very small transition, mad. Probably the Kelts\r\nborrowed it, for _fol_ was inspired or mad; and Folia of Ariminium is\r\nmentioned by Horace as a magician. Our fool is thus traceable to _vola_,\r\ninspired, but probably through the Keltic and French medium.\r\n\r\nVili, though his myths have been forgotten, still stands as a great\r\nancestor. From him in Germany, either directly or through a renewal of\r\nhim as a forefather, must have been named the great race of the\r\nBillingen, the first dynasty of the continental Sachsen, who gave\r\nemperors to Germany.\r\n\r\nBilling is the son of Wili, or Will; and so again is, in the North,\r\nVilkin, the father of the famous smith Volundr, whose name is probably\r\nfrom this original root, will or mind, though its immediate source is\r\nthought to be _vel_, art or cunning, cognate with our own guile, and\r\nprobably the participle of a lost verb, to devise. Some connect it with\r\nVulcan, from the name and character of Volundr. He was the son of a sea\r\nmaiden, and of Vidja the Vilkin; and he and his two brothers each\r\nmarried a Valkyr, who, at the end of a stated period, had to be absent\r\nfor nine years, giving to each husband magic gifts and precious stones\r\nthat dimmed when disaster was about to befall them. Volundr was the\r\nfortunate brother of the three, and was the mighty smith to whom all\r\ngood weapons are ascribed. From him the early part of the Norse poem\r\nending with the slaying of Fafner is called the Volsunga Saga, as, from\r\nhis father, the Danish version is the Wilkina Saga; for the hero himself\r\nis his descendant, a Wælsing, or Vilking, and fights with his redoubted\r\nweapons. Weland again makes the impenetrable corslet of Beowulf, “the\r\ntwisted breastnet which protected his life against point and edge;” he\r\nis the Wiolent, Velint, or Wieland of Germany, and Galando of Italy, the\r\nGalant of France, who forged their Joyeuse, the sword of Charlemagne,\r\nand Cortana, that of Ogier. A skilful Weland is mentioned in an old\r\nAnglo-Saxon MS. found at Exeter, and in King Alfred’s translation of\r\nBoëthius he renders the line,\r\n\r\n                “Ubi nunc fidelis ossa Fabricii jacent?”\r\n\r\n(meaning, of course, an artificer, the sense of the name,) “Where are\r\nnow the bones of the wise Weland, the goldsmith who was most famed?” A\r\nworkman is still called in Iceland, _Völundrinjarn_, and a labyrinth is\r\n_Volundrhus_. This famous armourer took possession of a Druidical\r\ncromlech in the midst of the battle-grounds between the Danes and Saxons\r\non the Berkshire downs, and there drove his shadowy trade as Wayland\r\nSmith, close to King Alfred’s own birthplace, Wantage. He was spared\r\nfrom oblivion by being embalmed in _Kenilworth_, where the only blunder\r\nis in making Lancelot Wayland the real name of the estimable mountebank,\r\nwho personated the mythical smith. Though Wieland is a German surname,\r\nthe coincidence of an English Wayland was too much for probability; and,\r\nin fact, Scott does not seem to have known how very ancient Wayland\r\nSmith had really been.\r\n\r\nNames in Wal are chiefly Northern, those in Wil mostly Saxon. Ullr, or\r\nUll, another Northern form, has been much used in Iceland; and among the\r\nNorthern isles of Scotland, where it may be remembered that Ulla Troil\r\nwas the real name of Norna. Ullr was the stepson of Thor, son of Sif,\r\nand renowned as a great bow-bearer.\r\n\r\nWil is almost always a commencement. The Frank queen Bilichilde was, of\r\ncourse, Willihilda, resolute battle. Our earnest but turbulent Wilfrith,\r\nthe Yorkshire bishop, hardly deserved to be called resolute peace; but\r\nas patron of Ripon, his name has continued in the North, Wilfroy being\r\nvery frequent in older registers in the neighbourhood of Ripon, though\r\nof late fashion has adopted it in the form of Wilfred.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh century, we sent Germany two missionaries with this\r\nprefix, Willibrord and Willihold; also Willibald, resolute prince, went\r\non pilgrimage with his father, St. Richard of Wessex, in 721, and\r\nfinished his career as bishop of Aichstadt, leaving his name to take\r\nroot in various forms.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │Portuguese. │   Dutch.   │ Bavarian.\r\n   │Willibald   │Guillibaud  │Guilbaldo   │Willebald   │Willibald\r\n   │Wibald      │            │Vilibaldo   │            │Waldl\r\n   │            │            │            │            │Waltl\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\nNative to Germany is Williburg, which has a northern fac-simile\r\nVilbjorg, and Vilgerd, the same in meaning, resolute protection;\r\nWillrich, resolute ruler; Willehad, resolute violence; Willeram,\r\nresolute raven; Willihard, reduplicating firmness; Willigis, willing\r\npledge, or pledge of the will; Willimar, resolute fame, making our\r\nsurname Wilmer. Williheri, resolute warrior, is the source of the German\r\nWiller, the English Weller, the French Villiers and Villars, which, with\r\ntheir aristocratic sound, betray little of their kindred to Sam Weller.\r\n\r\nWhere the most popular of all the Wills was invented it is not easy to\r\ndiscover, but Germany is its most likely region, since _helm_ is a\r\nspecially Germanic termination, and the Billings favoured the\r\ncommencement; besides which the pronunciation in that language leaves\r\nthe words their natural meanings, Will-helm, resolute helmet, or,\r\nperhaps, helmet of resolution. The native northern name would be\r\nVilhjalm, but this is never used, it being only imported bodily as\r\nWilhelm into Denmark from Germany, just as our Ethelbert is superseded\r\nby Albert.\r\n\r\nThe cause of its adoption in Normandy cannot have been one of the eight\r\nsaints in the Roman calendar who bear it; for not one is anterior to the\r\nson of Rollo, the second Duke of Normandy, from whom William descended\r\nto the Conqueror, and became one of the most national of English names.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Welsh.     │    Breton.    │    French.    │\r\n   │William        │Guillim        │Guillern       │Guillaume      │\r\n   │Will           │               │Guillarn       │Guillemot      │\r\n   │Willie         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Bill           │               │               │               │\r\n   │Wilkin         │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Old French.  │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Willelme       │Guillermo      │Guilhermo      │Guglielmo      │\r\n   │Willeaulme     │Guillen        │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Dutch.     │    Swiss.     │   Frisian.    │\r\n   │Wilhelm        │Willem         │Wilhelm        │Willo          │\r\n   │Wilm           │Wim            │Wille          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │     Lett.     │    Greek.     │\r\n   │Vilhelm        │Vilem          │Willums        │Goulielmos     │\r\n   │               │               │Wille          │Bilelmos       │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Wilhelmina     │Guillerume     │Guillemma      │Guglielma      │\r\n   │Wilmett        │Guillemette    │   —————————   │   —————————   │\r\n   │Wilmot         │Minette        │  Portuguese.  │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Mina           │Mimi           │Guilhermma     │Vilhelmine     │\r\n   │Minella        │Guillette      │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Swiss.     │  Lithuanian.  │    Dutch.     │\r\n   │Wilhelmine     │Mimmoli        │Myne           │Willemyn       │\r\n   │Helmine        │Mimmeli        │Mynette        │Willempje      │\r\n   │Mine           │   —————————   │               │               │\r\n   │Minchen        │    Polish.    │               │               │\r\n   │Minna          │Minka          │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nOld Camden’s account of it is too quaint not to be here inserted:\r\n“William, _gerne_. For sweeter sound drawn from Wilhelm, which is\r\ninterpreted by Luther much defence, or defence to many; as Wiliwald,\r\nruling many; Wildred, much reverent fear, or awful; Wilfred, much peace;\r\nWilibert, much brightness. So the French, that cannot pronounce _W_,\r\nhave turned it into Philli, as Philibert for Wilibert, much brightnesse.\r\nMany names wherein we have Will seem translated from the Greek names\r\ncomposed of πολύς; as Polydamas, Polybius, Polyxenes, &c. Helm yet\r\nremained with us, and Villi, Willi, and Billi yet with the German for\r\nmany. Others term William willing defender, and so it answereth the\r\nRoman Titus, if it come from _tuendo_, as some learned will have it. The\r\nItalians that liked the name but could not pronounce the _W_, if we may\r\nbelieve Gesner, turned it into Galeazzo, retaining the sense in part for\r\nhelm; but the Italians report that Galeazzo, the first viscount of\r\nMillain, was so called for the many cocks that krew lustily at his\r\nbirth. This name hath been most common in England since William the\r\nConqueror, insomuch that on a festival day in the court of King Henry\r\nII., when Sir William St. John and Sir William Fitzhamon, especial\r\nofficers, had commanded that none but the name of William should dine\r\nwith them in the great chamber, they were accompanied with one hundred\r\nand twenty Williams, all knights, as Robert Montensis recordeth, anno\r\n1173.”\r\n\r\nCamden’s authority is not Martin Luther, but one Mr. Luther Dasipodius,\r\nby whom he sets great store, and whose ‘German villi or billi, many,’\r\nmust have been the word now called _viel_. Verstegan’s history of\r\nWilliam is still droller, namely, that any German who killed a Roman\r\nassumed the golden head-piece of the slain, and was thence called\r\nGildhelm, which would of course be inconsistent with the old German form\r\nof Wilihelm. Be it observed that our _sur_name Wilmot descends from a\r\nname to be found in German as Wilmod, resolute mood; but the feminine\r\nWilmett, which is to be found continually in old Devon and Cornwall\r\nregisters, is no doubt the same as the old French Guillemette, and it is\r\na pity it has been discarded for the cumbrous German Wilhelmina, or the\r\nWilliamina that is of no language at all.\r\n\r\nCamden is probably right in taking Filiberto from Wiliberaht, or\r\nWilibert, resolute splendour, though Germans refer it to _viel_, the\r\nsame as our full, and the Greek _polys_. The founder of the name in the\r\nsixth century was a Frank Willibert, who founded the abbey of Jumièges,\r\nwhich the Normans first desolated and then restored, their Frenchified\r\ntongues bringing the patron’s name to England as Fulbert, which is still\r\noccasionally found in old families. The ninth grand master of St. John\r\nmeantime bore the French form, which historians wrote as Philibert; and\r\nthe old counts of Savoy alternated Filiberto with Amê, until they\r\nblossomed out into double names, as Vittore Amadeo or Filiberto\r\nEmanuele.\r\n\r\nThe _Val_ of choice, or slaughter, is not, Professor Munch tells us, to\r\nbe confounded with another _Val_, taken from the word _waleh_, or\r\n_waalh_, a stranger, which, as has been already said, named Wales. Our\r\nown Waltheof, being spelt in his native tongue Wealtheof, thus removes\r\nhimself and an Icelandic Valtheof from being slaughter-thieves to being\r\nforeign-thieves; a change not much for the better. There were fierce\r\nDanish ancestors, however, to account for this predatory appellation\r\nlighting upon the earl, whom the Conqueror executed at Winchester, and\r\nthe English revered as a saint; then from him it descended to his\r\ngrandson, Waltheof de St. Lys, the stepson of St. David of Scotland,\r\ncompanion of the excellent prince Henry, and, finally, abbot of Melross,\r\nwhere he was canonized as St. Walthenius, or Walen, and thus accounts\r\nfor the surname of Wathen.\r\n\r\nWalmer is, in old German, Walahmar, and thus shows itself to be foreign\r\nfame; Walager is also foreign war, and became Valgeir in the North,\r\nGaucher in France; and thence, too, by corruption, Valgard, the evil\r\ngenius of the Njal Saga.\r\n\r\nWalaraban, or Walram, seems appropriate as slaughter-raven, but is\r\nuncertain. The French made it Gauteran; and in the form of Waleran it\r\nwas used in the House of Luxembourg, Counts of St. Pol; it is Galerano\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nWalabert, a monk who died at Luxen, in 625, is the same as the northern\r\nValbjart; and another Valbert, or Vaubert, as he is called in France,\r\nhad a daughter Valtrud, canonized as St. Vautrude, or Vaudru. From\r\nWalamund, the French take Valmont; and Walarik, an Auvergne hermit, was\r\nLatinized as Valaricus, and Frenchified into St. Valery, a territorial\r\nsurname.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic king Wallia is left in possession of the battle-field; and so\r\nare the northern Valdis and Valbiorg, both thorough Valkyr names, not\r\nyet disused. Valtrude, an early saint, must certainly be named from a\r\nslaughter-maiden. So probably was Walburh, slaughter-pledge, one of the\r\nEnglish missionary ladies employed by St. Boniface in Mainz. She was a\r\nvery popular saint, and is called Valpurgis, Vaubone, Vaubourg. Her\r\nEnglish church is Wembury, in Devon. Part of her relics were translated\r\nfrom Eichstadt to Furnes, near Ostend, in 1109, on the 1st of May, when\r\none of her festivals is kept. Then is supposed to follow the Valpurgis\r\nNacht, the Witches' Sabbath, on the Brocken. Surely this strange\r\nconnection with the saintly abbess must be due to some old observance in\r\nhonour of a Valkyr Valburg. Valasquita, an old name found among the\r\nladies of the Asturias, Navarre, and Biscay, was probably from this\r\nsource.[113]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  Junius; Grimm; Luning; Blackwell, Mallet; Lappenberg; Dasent; Munter;\r\n  Alban Butler; Camden; Verstegann; Pott; Köppen; Michaelis; Howitt,\r\n  _Literature of the North_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION X.—_Hilda._\r\n\r\nChief among the Valkyrier was Hildur, Hild, or Hiltia, who is never\r\nwanting in any enumeration of these warlike spirits. The word, in its\r\noriginal sense, means battle, and has thus attached itself to the\r\nprincipal war-maiden; nay, it has passed from her to be a poetical term\r\nfor any maiden, and is one of the very commonest terminations to\r\nfeminine names throughout the Teutonic world, and is likewise often\r\nfound at the beginning of men’s names, predominating perhaps in Germany.\r\n\r\nAlone, it was only used in the North and in England, where the Deiran\r\nprincess Hildur became the holy abbess Hilda of Whitby, succeeding St.\r\nBegga, and leaving a reputation for sanctity enhanced, by the sight of\r\n\r\n                     “The very form of Hilda fair\r\n                     Hovering upon the sunny air;”\r\n\r\na vision which, though Clara de Clare could not see it, is to be beheld\r\nunder certain conditions of light, in the windows of Whitby church to\r\nthe present day; as well as the ammonites, believed, as usual, to have\r\nbeen serpents turned to stone at the prayer of the saint. In honour of\r\nher, Hilda is still used as a name about Whitby.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Rolf Gangr, progenitress of our royalty, who vainly\r\nbesought Harald Harfagre not to banish her sons from Norway, was named\r\nHildr; and the name still survives in Scandinavia and Iceland, where the\r\n_Landnama-bok_ shows it to have been very plentiful, seventeen ladies\r\nbeing recorded as bearing it. There, too, occurs Hildiridur, battle\r\nhastener, a thorough Valkyr name, but not very suitable to Fouqué’s\r\nsweet Lady Minnetröst, of the moonlight brown eyes.\r\n\r\nHildelildis, Battle Spirit, is an Anglo-Norman lady’s name.\r\n\r\nThe true Frank form of the aspirate was, however, exceedingly harsh,\r\namounting to the Greek χ, and therefore, usually set down in its\r\ntransitions through Latin and French as a _ch_. So we meet, among the\r\nMeerwings, with Childebert, who by translation is Hildebert,\r\nbattle-splendour, and Childebrand, or battle-sword.\r\n\r\nThese two last names, in their Low German form of Hiltibrant and\r\nHiltibraht, occur again in the old poem, already referred to, of\r\n_Hiltibrant and Hadubrant_, both meaning battle-swords, which goes\r\nthrough a dispute about Hadubrand’s father, and, finally, leaves them in\r\nthe middle of a single combat.\r\n\r\nHildebrand is, as we know from old German and Danish poems, the\r\ncompanion and friend of Dietrich of Bern. He had, like some hero in\r\nevery cycle of story, married and deserted a young wife; and after\r\nassisting his master in many adventures, and much dragon killing, and\r\nbeing the sole survivor of all Dietrich’s men in the great massacre of\r\nthe _Nibelung_, he encountered, without knowing him, his young son,\r\nAlebrand. In a single combat, where both do their devoir, the old knight\r\nis wounded, the younger overthrown. Then they discover each other, by\r\nthe tokens that Hildebrand had left with the mother, and\r\n\r\n                  “Up rose the youthful Alebrand,\r\n                    And into Bern they ride;\r\n                  What bears he on his helmet?\r\n                    A little cross of gold.\r\n                  And what on his right hand bears he?\r\n                    His dearest father old.”\r\n\r\nSo, recommended by fame, Hildebrand continued a knightly name in England\r\nand Germany for many ages, and belonged to that battle-sword of the\r\nChurch, who, on his election to the papacy, was called Gregory VII.,\r\nthough we still continue to think of him as Pope Hildebrand; and the\r\neccentric Dr. Wolff tells us that one of the dreams of his youth was to\r\nwear the tiara by the name of Hildebrand! In Italy, pronunciation turned\r\nit into Aldobrando, then into Aldrovando, and then Latin made\r\nAldrovandus.\r\n\r\nHildegunnr, battle-maid of war, was another northern name, and is the\r\nsame as the German Hildegund, which was rather a favourite. It is\r\nAldegonde in the Cambrai register, and the territorial surname of St.\r\nAldegonde is memorable in the revolt of the Low Countries. Hildegard, in\r\nhonour of an abbess in the Palatinate, who died in 1004, is still a very\r\ncommon name among German ladies, and going to Denmark, has been\r\ncorrupted into Ollegaard. It is exactly the same in meaning with the\r\nnorthern Hildebjorg. So again are Hildewig and Hildegar, and among the\r\nGothic queens of Spain is found Hilduara, or battle prudence.\r\n\r\nSt. Hiltrude of Liessies, revered in Poitou and Hainault, unites two\r\nValkyr titles—Hildur and Thrudr; for Thrûdr is generally enumerated\r\namong the Valkyr. The word once meant, in the North, fortitude, or\r\nfirmness, and is possibly connected with truth; but in all the Teuton\r\nlanguages it signifies maiden, or virgin. Perhaps, in connection with\r\nthe Valkyrer, Hildur might have been the patroness of courage, and\r\nThrudr of fortitude; but, unfortunately, perhaps from the spells used by\r\nthe women in soothsaying before a battle, Thrudr sank down from its high\r\nestate, and _drude_, or _drut_, means a witch, and in German, also, an\r\nevil spirit. Thrudvangr, or Constancy’s abode, was one of the names of\r\nValhall. _Thrud_, _trud_, _tru_, is, in Scandinavia and Germany, as\r\nfavourite a feminine termination as Hilda, and, no doubt, with the same\r\nmeaning, though its owners would fain translate it by truth; but it\r\ncannot be brought nearer than constancy, or fortitude. Sometimes it\r\nstands alone. Drot, as it has become by pronunciation, figures in the\r\n_Heimskringla_; and the Danes must have brought it to England, for in\r\nBishop-Middleham, in the county of Durham, we meet, in 1683, with Troth\r\nBradshau, who is again Trouth, or Troath, in the old spelling. Trott\r\nalso several times occurs; and we are thus led to the conclusion that\r\nthe dear old Dame Trot of the nursery bears the respected name of the\r\nValkyr of fortitude. _Truth_ is, perhaps, the same, originally coaxed by\r\nPuritan invention.\r\n\r\nCyndrida, or Quendrida, as the histories call her, the wife of Offa, is\r\nsuspected by Mr. Kemble to have been mixed up with her namesake, Thrudr,\r\nthe Valkyr. She was said to be a Frankish princess, who came floating\r\nover the waters, having been exposed in a boat for some unknown crime.\r\nHer beauty fascinated Offa, king of Mercia; he married her, and she was\r\nthe only old English queen who caused her image to be stamped on her\r\ncoins. She treacherously murdered her son-in-law, and was put to death\r\nby being thrown down a well. Some part of this is history; other parts\r\nare thought to be taken from an Anglian myth of an elder fabulous Offa,\r\nwhose wife was almost certainly a Valkyr, and, on her marriage, lost her\r\nsupernatural strength. Cyne, or Cwen, a woman, only appears again with\r\nCwenburh, another Saxon queen, and may have been merely an affix.\r\n\r\nOther German masculine forms are Hildeman, or Hilman; Hildemund, or\r\nHilmund; Hildewart—in Friesland, Hilwert; Hildefrid, or Hilfrid;\r\nHildebold; Hilding; Hildrad, the Hildert, or Hillert, of Friesland;\r\nHilram, the contraction of Hilda’s raven.\r\n\r\nGothic Spain coined, however, the most noted form of the name when\r\nHildefuns, or battle vehemence, came on the Latin lips of her people to\r\nbe Ildefonso, or Illefonso, as the great bishop of Toledo, of the\r\nseventh century, was called. Then, shortening into Alfonso, and again\r\ninto Alonzo, the same came to the second gallant king of the Asturias,\r\nhusband of Pelayo’s daughter, and became the most national of all the\r\nPeninsular names, belonging to eleven Castillian kings and nine\r\nAragonese, and to the present king of Spain; but never passing beyond\r\nthe Peninsula as a royal name, save to the Aragonese dynasty in Sicily\r\nand Naples. In England we nearly had it, for one of the sons of Edward\r\nI. and the Castillian Eleanor was so baptized; but his early death saved\r\nour lips from the necessity of framing themselves to its southern flow.\r\nAlphonse has been a favourite French name. The Portuguese Affonso,\r\nthough often used as its equivalent, is Hadufuns, very similar in\r\nmeaning, but rather meaning war vehemence than battle vehemence. The\r\nfeminine is the Spanish Alfonsina, and the French Alphonsine.[114]\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  German.   │  French.   │  Spanish.  │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Alphonso    │Alfons      │Alphonse    │Ildefonso   │Alfonso     │\r\n   │Alonzo      │            │            │Alfonso     │            │\r\n   │            │            │            │Alonso      │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Luning; Munter; Blackwell, Mallet; Munch; _Landnama-bok_;\r\n  White, _Walking Tour_; Roscoe, _Int. to Boiardo_; Thierry, _Récits des\r\n  Temps Merovingiens_; Weber and Jamieson, _Northern Romance_;\r\n  Michaelis; Pott; Surtees; Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION XI.—_Ve._\r\n\r\nThe third deity who, with Odin and Wili, gave life to man, was Ve, who\r\nbestowed blood and colour.\r\n\r\nVe is thought to be connected with the Persian word _veh_, pure, and to\r\nlie at the root of _veihan_, to consecrate, in Mæso-Gothic; _weihan_, in\r\nGerman; whence Christmas is Weihnacht, holy night.\r\n\r\n_Ve_ was the god in ancient German, _vear_ the plural for gods; but,\r\nmoreover, _ve_, as a plural, meant sacred regions, and these, among the\r\nTeutons, were groves; _wih_, a grove in old German, a temple in old\r\nSaxon. Thence the northern _vid_, German _wald_, English _wood_, all\r\npassing from the sense of the consecrated forest to be merely the trees,\r\nand, in our language, the actual timber of which they are composed.\r\n\r\nVe appears no more; but Vidar (Vithar), a son of Odin, explained by\r\nLuning to signify the inexhaustible force of nature, is, in the final\r\nconflict, to set his foot on the Fenris wolf, and rend him asunder, and\r\nwith Vali, the chosen, to pass unscathed through fire and flood, and\r\nbehold the renovation of all things.\r\n\r\nVe and Vid do their part in names. Vadi, Wade, or Wato, is a giant\r\nancestor in the Vilkinga Saga; and the father of Volundr is, in the\r\nNorth, Vidja or Vudga; in Germany, Wittege or Wittich, a name mentioned\r\nby Jornandes as Vidigoja. The son of Volundr also bears the same name,\r\nVedja or Wilken, and kills the giant Etgeir, called in the Danish\r\nballad, Langbeen Riser, or long-legged giant. The grave and the oven of\r\nthe giant are still shown in Zeeland.\r\n\r\nIt is the Vitiges whom the Byzantine writers mention among their Gothic\r\nfoes in Italy, and the Vitiza of the latter Visigoths in Spain, and may\r\nfairly be rendered a dweller in a wood, though, in effect, it conveyed\r\nthe sense of consecration.\r\n\r\nThence, too, the Widukind, or Witukind, of Saxony, the fierce old\r\nchieftain subdued by Charlemagne, whose name Scott gave to old\r\n‘Witikind, the waster,’ but erroneously, for a Dane would have begun his\r\nname with Ved. Before comparison had cleared up the history of names,\r\nWitikind used, however, to be translated white child.\r\n\r\nGermany has many of such grove names, the forest wolf and raven, as\r\nWitolf and Witram; the forest prince, as Witrich, and his fame as\r\nWitmar; also Witpald, Witperaht, and Witheri, the like of which last is\r\nfound in Domesday Book before the Conquest, as Wither, in company with\r\nWitlac, Witgar, and Wit, and Witgils is high up in the Anglo-Saxon\r\ngenealogy.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to refer such names as these to _wit_ and _wise_, both\r\nfrom _vidjan_, to know, and to think of the _vedas_; but the wood and\r\nits spirit of consecration is the real source of all these, as of\r\nVebiorn, Vebrandr, Vedis, Vedornn, Vegeir, Velaug, Vemundr, Vedny,\r\nVedhelm, Vedhild, Vestan, all names of the North. Verena, the gentle\r\nmother of Sintram, may, perhaps, be meant for Vedrun, which would mean\r\nsacred wisdom, or for Vedrid, sacred eagerness; just as Sigrid has\r\nformed Siri and Serena.\r\n\r\nThe only cases where _wise_ or _vit_ has produced a name, were Vitgeir\r\nof Iceland, who received that prefix for his magic powers, and Robert\r\nd'Hauteville, surnamed Guiscard, wise heart, or wizard, the Norman\r\nconqueror of Apulia, from whose soubriquet Guiscard was afterwards used\r\nas a name in France, whence Sir Guiscard d'Angle appears in Froissart.\r\n\r\n_Ve_, or _verr_, is common at the end of northern names, as in Raadve or\r\nRandverr, and stood as _vih_ at the end of the old Frankish names, where\r\nit is apt to get confused with _wig_, war. _Vid_, the forest or tree, is\r\na favourate Norsk termination, apt to be taken for _hvit_, white.[115]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  Blackwell; Grimm; Munch; _Domesday Book_; _Landnama-bok_; Le Beau;\r\n  Mariane; Weber and Jamieson, _Northern Romance_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XII.—_Gerda._\r\n\r\nFreyr’s beautiful wife, whose loveliness was reflected by land and sea,\r\nwas Gerda, a word coming from _gerdhi_ or _gerthi_, to gird round, and\r\nthus denoting the enclosed cornfield, the emblem of peace and blessing.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the other hand, _gerd_ was sometimes poetically used for the\r\nentire girding or harness of a warrior prepared for battle, and in both\r\nthese senses, as well as of the dedication to the goddess, Gerdur was a\r\nfavourite feminine in the North; and Gerda has still continued in use in\r\nNorway and Iceland, besides supplying a great many terminations, chiefly\r\nto Germany, in Ermengard, Hildegard, &c.\r\n\r\nIts original source is exceedingly old, and conveys the idea of turning\r\nround, as in γῦρος (gyros), _curvus_, &c., and all their derivatives in\r\nthe classical languages.\r\n\r\nIn the northern tongues arose gjorde (Nor.), gyrden (A. S.), whence all\r\nthe varieties of girth and gird. Thence came the Danish Gyrthr, which,\r\nwhen borne by the best and most faithful of the sons of Earl Godwin, was\r\nrendered into modern English as Gurth, and thus was bestowed by Scott\r\nupon the honest thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood. This name, then,\r\nproperly means the warrior girt for battle.\r\n\r\n_Gard_ is part of a man’s name in the North; _e.g._, Gardar, who was the\r\nSwede who first sailed round Iceland, came from Gardhar, house-warrior,\r\nor perhaps patriot; Gardmund and Gardbrand, one the hand, another the\r\nsword of the country, are also found; but, in general, this is a\r\ntermination, as with Finngard, Thorgard, Valgard.\r\n\r\nOther names of men ending with _gerd_ are generally corruptions of words\r\nfrom _geir_.[116]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XIII.—_Œgir._\r\n\r\nWhen the Aasir took up their abode in Asgard, they there found the\r\nJotun, or giants, of whom the chief was Fornioti, a word meaning the\r\naged. He had three sons, Hler, Logi, and Kari, ruling sea, flame, and\r\nwind. After a long contest they seem to have been promoted to the\r\nprivileges of Aasir, and remained allies, if not friends, till the\r\ntreason of Logi or Loki brought about the death of Baldur, after which\r\nthe destroyer Loki and his children, the Fenris wolf (the wolf of the\r\nfen or abyss), Hel, or death, and the Midgard serpent, were bound till\r\nthe last outbreak shall take place.\r\n\r\nKari and Hler appear to have retained their privileges as gods or\r\ndemi-gods of wind and wave. Kari is called Fasolt in Germany, but his\r\nname of Kaari or Kari has continued in use in Norway and Iceland, and\r\nbelonged to the generous avenger of Burnt Njal and his sons.\r\n\r\nHler is evidently the Keltic Lyr, but on his promotion to rank with the\r\nAasir, he took the northern name of Agir, Ygg, or Œgir. He was on very\r\nfriendly terms with the Aasir, gave them banquets, visited them at\r\nAsgard, and heard Bragi tell stories of their deeds; but his usual\r\noccupation was to raise his hoary head above the water when he meant\r\nevil to vessels; and when he raised storms, his wife Ran (from _rœina_,\r\nto spoil,) sat fishing for sailors, whose spirits she imprisoned like a\r\nwater Hela, so that drowned men were said to be gone to Ran, before Davy\r\nJones superseded her in nautical language. His daughter, Unna, was the\r\nwave rising as in human shape. All these images evidently arose from the\r\nwild, heaped, confused masses of waves in the North Sea, which, instead\r\nof forming the even sweep of ridge and furrow of the Atlantic, are in\r\ntumbling masses, suggesting the human form. Unna is said to come from\r\nthe same root as _unda_, the Latin wave; but the word also means love,\r\nand thence a woman, and there is a curious similitude in it to Aine, the\r\ngranddaughter of Lyr, in Irish legend. In Germany, Œgir was Ecke, but\r\nwas reduced to fresh water and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe root of the name of Œgir is, in fact, _og_ or _uok_, the same as our\r\n_awe_. Thence come many words, such as the Frank _ega_, cunning; the\r\nSaxon _ege_, fear; also the verb _eggan_, to incite, still common in the\r\nNorth; while we have _to egg on_.\r\n\r\nIt has been extremely fertile in names, in many different forms, the\r\nsimplest being the Frank Ega, a _maire du palais_. Our own two kings,\r\nEcgfrith and Ecgberht, are probably thus derived, though some explain\r\ntheir first syllable by _edge_; but they are far more probably the same\r\nwith the _awe_ of the North. Egbert continues in Friesland as Ebbert.\r\n\r\n_Aug_ is the oldest form in the North, as in Augmund, which, however,\r\nwas soon turned into Ogmund, Agmund, and Amund, a shape in which it is\r\ncommon in the North, while in the Low Countries it gave the title of\r\nEgmont to the victim of Alva. Ogwald has run something the same course\r\nin the North, and become Avald; Œgunn and Œgulv are also there; and in\r\nGermany Egiheri once existed, and gave us the surnames of Agar and\r\nEggar; Eggerich makes the Frisian Eggert, Iggerick, and Eggo.\r\n\r\nThe most famous German hero connected with the name is _der treue\r\nEckhardt_, who is well named awful firmness, warns travellers from the\r\ntempting mountain of fatal delights, the Venusberg, once belonging to\r\nHela herself. Eckhard is chiefly Frisian in the present day, and there\r\nit forms into Eggo, Ike, and Edzard.\r\n\r\nIt is identically the same name as Eginhard, the contemporary chronicler\r\nof Charlemagne. The _n_ being used in declining the leading noun, is\r\nretained in the pronunciation of the name. Friesland, however, separates\r\nthe two, and shortens Eginhard into Eino, Aynnert, Aynt.\r\n\r\nThus again is formed the original northern Aginhar, awful warrior, who\r\nfell down into Agnar and Agne. Einar, of which there were twenty-two in\r\nthe _Landnama-bok_, looks very much like another contraction of Aginhar;\r\nbut analogy is against it; and Professor Munch decides that the first\r\nsyllable, both of Einar and Eindride, a rather popular old Norsk\r\nfeminine, is _ein_, one, in the sense of chief or superior; so that\r\nEinar would be chief warrior, Eindride, Endride, or Indride, as it is\r\nalso used, superior rider.\r\n\r\nThe dative form of Ag is Agli, whence Egils, or Eigils, has come to be a\r\nfavourite northern name, and in this shape it is a very frequent prefix.\r\nEgilona was the unfortunate wife of Rodrigo, the last of the Goths, and\r\nafterwards of the Moorish prince, his conqueror, whom she forced to do\r\nhomage to the Cross, by having the door of her room opposite to it made\r\nso low that he could not enter without stooping. Agilo was a Frank\r\nnobleman, and in Domesday we fall upon an undoubted Agilward and\r\nEgelmar, and on what are probably their contractions, Aylward and\r\nAylmer, afterwards Aymar; but both these are contractions of other\r\nnames, and cannot always be referred to the awful god of the sea.\r\nAgilard, Agilulf, and Agilbert were Frank forms, the last Eilbert in\r\nGerman; Egilhart is Eilert, or Eilo, in German; Eilert, Ayelt, or Ayldo,\r\nin Frisian. And the Spanish Gothic Egica is another of the progeny of\r\nthe old sea giant. Oht is a word also meaning terror.[117]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  Luning; Munch; Grimm; Tooke; Liddell and Scott; _Landnama-bok_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Munch; Blackwell; Luning; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION XIV.—_Ing—Seaxnot._\r\n\r\nLeaving the comparatively clear and consistent regions of Scandinavian\r\nmythology, we pass to the divinities and forefathers of whom we know far\r\nless, those of our own Anglian ancestors; some accepted by them in\r\ncommon with the High Germans, others exclusively their own, and some\r\napparently known to the North, though not admitted into the system of\r\nthe _Edda_.\r\n\r\nThe northern cosmogony tells us of the first man, Buri, whom the cow\r\nAudumbla licked out of the stone, and whose grandson Odin was. It also\r\ntells us of the primeval man and woman, Ask and Embla, whom Odin, Vili,\r\nand Ve, animated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Tacitus, writing of the ancient Germans, makes them\r\nstart from an earth-born god, Tuisco, whose son was Mannus; and again,\r\nMannus’s three sons were Ingus, Iscus, and Hermius, Ing, Esc, and Ed,\r\nfrom whom descended the Ingævones, Iscævones, and Hermiones.\r\n\r\nTuisco is Tiu, or, more properly, the divine word in another form. He\r\nrepresents the original stock of Teutonism, and also the human sense of\r\na divine origin, for Mannus, of course, is man.\r\n\r\nEsk, or Ask, has scarcely formed any names, but Ing, or Yngve, was\r\nlooked on as the ancestor of the Swedish kings, who thence were called\r\nthe Ynglinga; and the history which rationalizes Odin is thence termed\r\nthe Ynglinga Saga, as it makes Yngve his son, and deduces the line from\r\nhim. Ing, the son of Tuisco, is, however, a far more universal\r\nforefather, being almost without a doubt the name-father of that great\r\nrace that we have called Angeln, Anglo-Saxons, and English.\r\n\r\nSeaxnot, or Sahsnot, was probably another name for Ing. The word means\r\nstone comrade, and he was supposed to be the ancestor of the Sachsen, or\r\nSaxons, but he has not numerous namesakes. In the East Saxon pedigree,\r\nwe find Seaxbeohrt and Seaxbald, and in the East Anglian Seaxburh or\r\nSexburga; and in Scandinavia Sakse remained as a name; and the historian\r\nof the twelfth century, who enlightened us so much on Danish history, is\r\nLatinized as Saxo Grammaticus.\r\n\r\nIng was a great deal more popular, though not among the Angles, either\r\ninsular or continental. The only trace of him in Germany is in the old\r\nname of Hinkmar, or Hinko; and our Anglo-Saxon kings enumerated Ingvi,\r\nIngebrand, and Ingegeat as connecting links between themselves and\r\nWuotan. The Goths, Burgundians, and Vandals also claimed descent from\r\nIngvja, and their princes were called Ingvineones.\r\n\r\nIngve, or Ingvar, was a royal name in Scandinavia, and so travelled with\r\nthe sons of Rurik to Russia; where Igor, as he was there called, led an\r\narmy to strike terror into Constantinople, and the name has since become\r\nconfused with Egor, or George. Ingulf was the secretary of William the\r\nConqueror, and we would fain believe in the history of Croyland that\r\ngoes by his name. Ingebjorg found her way into an old Saga as a\r\ndemi-goddess directing wind and rain; but her historical interest is\r\nconnected with the unfortunate Danish princess, whom Philippe Auguste\r\nmarried only to repudiate, and whom French historians translate into\r\nIngeberge, English ones into Ingoberga. Hers is the most common female\r\nname in Norway.\r\n\r\nThe North has likewise Ingegerdur, Ingeleif, Ingemundr, Ingeridur,\r\nIngiallur, Ingvilldur, Ingjard, and Ingrim. Ingvilhild has become\r\nEngelke, or Engel, and is, in fact, now merged in the idea of the Greek\r\nAngel. The same fate has befallen other names in Germany and France,\r\nwhere that best of all puns, as far as results were concerned, that of\r\nSt. Gregory between Angeli and Angli, has been constantly repeated in\r\nnomenclature. The Eng, Ing, or Engel, named from a forgotten tradition\r\nafter Ing, was well pleased to be dedicated to an angel; Ingram, once\r\nIng’s raven, became Engelram, and thought he was of angelic purity, in\r\nname if not in nature; and either he or Engelhard passed into France as\r\nEnguerraud, the chief Christian name of the brave house whose proud\r\nsaying was—\r\n\r\n                    “Je suis ni roi, ni comte aussi,\r\n                    Je suis le Sire de Coucy;”\r\n\r\nand the English called it Ingeltram, when Isabel, the daughter of Edward\r\nIII., made her love match with the brave Lord de Coucy, whose loyalty\r\nwas so sorely perplexed by his connection with her family.\r\n\r\nEngelfrid, Engelschalk, Engelberga, and Engelbert, are probably\r\noriginally German angels in connection with peace, discipleship,\r\nprotection, and splendour; and Professor Munch thinks the northern\r\nIngobert an instinctive attempt to nationalize the last. On the other\r\nhand, he leaves to Ing, Angilbald, Angiltrud, Angelrich; as, in fact,\r\nmay be always done with every name of the kind that can be traced to an\r\nowner prior to the time when angels were popular ideas among our\r\nnorthern ancestors.\r\n\r\nIngvar was a terrible name to our Saxon ancestors, when the Danish\r\nviking, so called, carried terror to our coasts; but Ivar is not the\r\nshort for it, but is from _yr_; German, _eibe_; Dutch, _ibe_; English,\r\n_yew_; and _har_, a warrior, so that Ivar is the Yew warrior, the\r\nbow-bearer, or archer. He is Iver in Danish, and in Scotland and Ireland\r\nMacIvor has been adopted as a rendering of one of the old hereditary\r\nKeltic names. Ivbald and Ivbert have also been used and cut down to\r\nIbald and Ibert. Ireland had a St. Ivor, or Ivory, who was considered to\r\nhave prayed away from Fernegenall the _mures maiores qui vulgariter Rati\r\nvocantur_ so completely that none survived; but whether he was named by\r\nDane or Kelt does not appear. At any rate, St. Ivory was deemed good to\r\ninvoke against rats.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Ivhar is the real origin of Ives, the saint who\r\nnamed the town in Huntingdonshire; but legend strangely makes him a\r\nPersian bishop, who chose that locality for a hermitage, in the seventh\r\ncentury, and whose body was discovered uncorrupt in the year 1001, thus\r\nproviding a patron for many an Ivar of Danish or Norman extraction, who\r\nbecame Yvon, or Ivone, in France; and Ivo in the chroniclers. Ivo de\r\nTaillebois is the villain of the story of _Hereward_ and his camp of\r\nrefuge; and the name is common with the Normans and Bretons, all the\r\nmore for the sake of St. Ivo de Chartres, who was imprisoned for his\r\nresistance to the adultery of Philip I. and Bertrade of Anjou, and St.\r\nIves of Brittany, the good lawyer, called the advocate of the poor.\r\nThese Breton Ivons may, however, be from Sir Ywain, or Owen, the same as\r\nEoghan.[118]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Munch; Luning; Kemble; O'Donovan; Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XV.—_Eormen._\r\n\r\nThe third son of Mannus was said to be Er, a word, perhaps, connected\r\nwith Tyr on one side, and Ares on the other; for Ertag is the Tuesday of\r\nSouthern Germany, and Eresburg, now Mersburg, was the centre of the\r\nworship of the continental Saxons. The day was, however, also called, in\r\nBavaria and Austria, Ermintag, or Irminstag; and the deity worshipped at\r\nEresburg was Irman, or Ermin; and perhaps the word should be considered\r\nas Er-man in conjunction. From him the Herminiones of Tacitus are said\r\nto be descended, being chiefly the old Germans and the Franks.\r\n\r\nAt Eresburg, even up to the eighth century, there stood a great central\r\ntemple, containing a marble column on which stood an armed warrior,\r\nholding, in one hand, a banner bearing a rose, in the other a balance.\r\nThe crest on the helmet was a cock, on the breastplate was a bear, on\r\nthe shield that hung from the shoulders was a lion in a field of\r\nflowers. Around lived a college of priests, who exercised judgment and\r\nmade biennial offerings. Before going out to war, the host, in full\r\narmour, galloped round the figure, brandishing their spears and praying\r\nfor victory. Lesser images were carried with the army, and, on its\r\nreturn, captives and cowards were slain, as offerings to the great idol.\r\n\r\nThis temple was destroyed by Charlemagne, who buried the idol where\r\nafterwards stood the abbey of Corbye. In his son’s reign it was dug up,\r\nand carried off by the French as a trophy, when the Saxons rose to\r\nrescue it and a battle took place, after which it was thrown into the\r\nriver Innen, but was fished out, exorcised, purified, and made to serve\r\nas a candelabrum in the church of Hillesheim.\r\n\r\nThe battle was called Armansula, and the image Irmansul; whence many\r\nhave fancied that Irmansul was the chief German god.\r\n\r\n_Sul_, or _saul_, is, however, a pillar; and it is a very curious fact\r\nthat two sacred columns were the penates of every Teuton’s hearth and\r\ncity. When a migration was decided on by the Scandinavians, a solemn\r\nfeast was held, the master of the house seated between his two _sulur_,\r\nor columns, which he uprooted and carried with him, and, on his approach\r\nto his intended home, he threw them overboard, and followed them with\r\nhis ship, landing wherever they were cast up. It was thus that the\r\nsituation of Reijkjavik, in Iceland, was determined. Such columns, down\r\nto a very late period, stood at the gates of the elder towns in Germany,\r\nand were called Ermensaulen, or, sometimes, one the Rolandsaul, the\r\nother the Ermensaul.\r\n\r\nEormon, in the Anglian of Beowulf, means universal; _eormoncyn_, the\r\nwhole of mankind; in old Norse, _jormün_ is the world, and _Jormungandr_\r\nis another name of the Midgard snake which encircles the world. Most\r\nlikely, the Irmansul thus signified the universal column, the pillar\r\nadored by all men; just as the Anglo-Saxons called the great Roman road\r\nEormenstreot, or Ermingstreet, the public road. _Er_, then, would be the\r\ndivinity, _man_ the human word, and Erman would thus express something\r\nrevered by all; and thence, the name of the tribes of the Hermiones and\r\nHermunduri, both meaning all the people. Later, the word _jormün_, or\r\n_eorman_, came to mean only very large; and, probably, the Saxons of\r\nThuringia had forgotten the original signification of their columns when\r\nthey gave the single one of Irmansul such an exclusive prominence. Some\r\nhave tried to explain one pillar as Heermansaul, pillar of the army man,\r\nand the other as Raginholdsaul, pillar of firm judgment, as emblems of\r\nmilitary and civil power; but though this meaning may have later been\r\nbestowed on them, the signification of Eormon is decidedly adverse to\r\nthis explanation, and it is safest to translate it, when it occurs in\r\nnames, as public, or general.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Armyn          │Armand         │Armando        │Arminio        │\r\n   │Armine         │               │               │Armanno        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Swedish.    │    Dutch.     │     Swiss.    │\r\n   │Hermann        │Hermann        │Hermanus       │Herma          │\r\n   │               │               │Herman         │Hermeli        │\r\n   │               │               │Manus          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Slovak.    │   Lettish.    │     Esth.     │  Lithuanian.  │\r\n   │Jerman         │Ermannis       │Herm           │Ermas          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Ermonas        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nWhen the Cheruschi, themselves Herminiones, broke the heart of Augustus\r\nby cutting off the legions of Quinctilius Varus, their leader was\r\nArminius, probably Irman or Eorman, though after-generations explained\r\nit as Heerman or Armyman. So that the hosts of Hermans, named when\r\nnational feeling was roused by French invasion, are in his honour;\r\npreviously, the Dutch Jacob Hermannsen had rendered himself into Latin\r\nas Arminius. From Holland the Norfolk name of Armyn must have been\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nThe Germans use, as the feminine, Hermine and Herminie, which properly\r\nbelong to the Latin Herminius; and the French have made their own form\r\nof Armand into Armantine. A Burgundian hermit, Ermin, too, gave St. Ermo\r\nto Italy, a name inextricably mixed with Elmo, the contraction of\r\nErasmus; it is the St. Erme of France.\r\n\r\nVery early, so as to be almost mythical, was the Thuringian Irmanfrit,\r\nor Irnvrit, who hardly conduced to ‘public peace’ by calling in the\r\nSaxons; but Hermanfred continued in use in Germany, and was known to the\r\nFrench as Hermanfroi.\r\n\r\nThe Burgundian version of the great world-girding snake was Ermelind, a\r\nname that came to a saintly virgin of the sixth century from whom\r\nErmelinda flourished as an Italian name, being probably common to both\r\nLombards and Burgundians, as both Vandals.\r\n\r\nBut these Irmins are most frequent in ancient Spain. The Suevi had\r\nHermanrik, or Hermanarico, public ruler, and the Goths, Hermanegar and\r\nHermangildo; the last being the prince who is revered as having been\r\nconverted from Arianism by his orthodox Frank wife, and whose death, by\r\nhis father’s persecution, sealed the triumph of Catholicism in Spain.\r\nHermenburga was a princess, offered to, but refused by, a Frank king;\r\nand Ermesinda, or, as Southey’s poem calls her, Hermesind, the daughter\r\nof Pelayo, carried the blue blood of the Balten to the line of Alfonso.\r\nHer name meant public dignity.\r\n\r\nParallel to these the Anglo-Saxons enumerate Eormenric, Eormenburh,\r\nEormenburg, Eormengyth, Eormengild; and after the Conquest there still\r\ncontinue the forms of Eremburga, Ermentrude, and Ermengarde; the last by\r\nfar the most frequent, and not yet disused in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION XVI.—_Erce._\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons were accustomed to perform an incantation to restore\r\nthe fruitfulness of their fields. It began by the cry _Erce_, _Erce_,\r\n_Erce_, _Eordhan Môder_, as if it were not earth itself, but her mother\r\nthat was called upon.\r\n\r\nThe same word _erce_ is used for ark, chest, or ship, in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nNew Testament. And Erce does not seem to have been entirely forgotten;\r\nfor Erche, or Herkja, is a famous lady in old German hero songs.\r\n\r\nFrom thence, too, may have sprung the Old German adjective _ërchan_,\r\nmeaning holy, genuine, or simple, which is thought to have named the\r\nfamous Hercynian forest of ancient Germany, which would thus be the\r\nsacred wood.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the East Saxon kingdom in England is called both Escwine\r\nand Ercenwine, the darling of Ese, or of Erce. In the Kentish genealogy\r\nwe find Eorconberht, sacred brightness, answering to the Lombardo-Italic\r\nErchimperto; and also Eorcongot, sacred divinity.\r\n\r\nSt. Eorconwald, holy power, was a bishop of London, about 678, and may\r\nalmost be reckoned as the second founder of St. Paul’s, where his shrine\r\nwas greatly revered; and about the same time Erkenoald was a _maire du\r\npalais_ in France; and Erchenold, or Herchenhold, was an old German\r\nname, meaning probably firm in truth.\r\n\r\nIn old knightly times, we find the German Erchanbald, meaning a sacred\r\nprince, from which the French took many a Sire Archambault, and the\r\nItalians Arcibaldo.\r\n\r\nThe Scots, by some strange fancy, adopted Archibald as the Lowland\r\nequivalent of Gillespie, the bishop’s servant. So frequent was it in the\r\nhouses of Campbell and Douglas, that, with its contractions of Archie\r\nand Baldie, it has become one of the most commonly used in Scotland,\r\nrecalling many a fierce worthy, from old Archibald Bell-the-Cat\r\ndownwards, and always translating the Gillespie of the Campbells to\r\nLowland ears.[119]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Grimm, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION XVII.—_Amal._\r\n\r\nAmal is a very remarkable word. We have had it in Greek, as Αἰμύλος; in\r\nLatin, as Æmilius; in the Keltic as Amalgaidh; and in all it would seem\r\nas if one notion could be detected—that of work. Even in Hebrew Amal\r\nmeans to work; _aml_ is work in old Norse; and we have still our verb to\r\n_moil_, taken therefrom. _Mahl_, be it remembered, is in German a time;\r\n_mahl_, a stroke; _mahlen_, to paint or make strokes; and so in the\r\nNorth, _maal_ is a measure, or an end, a goal. Probably there is a\r\nnotion of repetition of marks, stroke upon stroke, in all cases, and the\r\nSanscrit meaning of Amal, or spotless, without mark, is in favour of the\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nIt is safest, however, to translate the Teutonic Amal by work, the\r\nthought most familiar to the sturdy northern nations who used it, and\r\nloved work for its own sake.\r\n\r\nIn the Vilkina Saga, the mighty smith Velint’s first great trial of\r\nskill was with Amilias, an armourer at the court of King Nielung. Velint\r\nstruck him with his sword Mimung; he said he felt as if a drop of water\r\nhad flowed down him. “Shake yourself,” said Velint, and the unfortunate\r\nsmith fell down cloven painlessly from head to heel, an example of\r\nlabour _versus_ skill.\r\n\r\nAumlung, the strong, is mentioned in the _Book of Heroes_, as feasting\r\nat the Nibelung court; and it was at Duke Amelung’s court that,\r\naccording to the Danish ballad, old Sir Hildibrand had been staying for\r\ntwenty-two years, before, going back to Bern, he met his unknown son\r\nAlebrand.\r\n\r\nAmala was a favourite Lombardic commencement, and was likewise much in\r\nfavour with German ladies; it became first Amalie, and then, when Italy\r\nand France had taken up the Latin Æmilia, this old Teutonic form was\r\nmixed up with it; and Amelia in England, Amélie in France, are scarcely\r\nconsidered to differ from it; and though historically Emily is the\r\ndescendant of the Æmilii, Amelia of the Amaler, yet both alike come from\r\nthe original Amal.\r\n\r\nAmalaswinth, which would bear the translation, dignity of labour, though\r\nprobably it was only given in the sense of dignity of the Amaler, was\r\nthe unfortunate Lombardic queen, whom the Romans could not protect from\r\nthe treachery of her favourites. Amalasontha is what historians call\r\nher; but on Burgundian lips it came to be Melisenda, Melicerte,\r\nMelusine.\r\n\r\nMelisenda is in Spanish ballad lore the wife of Don Gayferos, and, being\r\ntaken captive by the Moors, was the occasion of the feats that were\r\nrepresented by the puppet show in which Don Quixote took an\r\nunfortunately lively interest. Melisende again was the princess who\r\ncarried the uneasy crown of Jerusalem to the House of Anjou; and,\r\nperhaps, from the Provençal connections of the English court, Lady\r\nMelisent Stafford bore the name in the time of Henry II., whence\r\nMelicent has become known in England, and never quite disused, though\r\noften confounded with Melissa, a bee, and sometimes spelt Millicent.\r\n\r\nMelusine was a nymph who became the wife of the Lord de Leezignan, or\r\nLusignan, on condition that he should never intrude upon her on a\r\nSaturday; of course, after a long time, his curiosity was excited, and\r\nstealing a glance at his lady in her solitude, he beheld her a serpent\r\nfrom the waist downward! With a terrible shriek, she was lost to him for\r\never; but she left three sons, all bearing some deformity, of whom\r\n_Geoffroi au grand dent_ was the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nMelusina continued in use in the south of France, Holland, and Germany,\r\nand is occasionally used in England. We find Melicerte in old French\r\nchronicles.\r\n\r\nThe very ancient queens of Navarre and the Asturias have a wonderful set\r\nof aliases, and one, the oddest, is “Amelina, or Simena, or Ximena,” the\r\nsister of Sancho I., of Navarre, who married Alfonso the Great. Could\r\nthe Spaniards, by any possibility, have contracted the soft _Amal_ into\r\nthe harsh guttural _Xi_, which sounds as if it came from a Moorish\r\nthroat. Yet, Goths as they were, they show no Amal, though their Ximen\r\nand Ximena reach up to 700, and Ximena survived long as a name among\r\ntheir ladies, and was the wife of the Cid, whence the French turned her\r\ninto Chimène. Emmeline, as it is now generally spelt, came from France\r\nas Emeline, and is frequent in old ballad poetry, and in northern\r\nregisters, as Emyln. It is probably another form of this same Amaline,\r\nor _lind_, Amal’s serpent.\r\n\r\nThe northern races have the one much reduced name of Malfrid, from\r\nAmalafrida, of peace.\r\n\r\nThe ladies have certainly been the chief owners of Amal, as a\r\ncommencement; but it has had a brilliant part to play in the form of\r\nAmalrich, Almerich, or Emmerich, on the German side; Almerigo in Spain;\r\nAmalric, or Amaury, in France; Almerick in England. Amaury was an\r\nAngevin king of Jerusalem; and our own Sir Almerick St. Lawrence was\r\nbrother-in-arms to Sir John de Courcy, and founded the House of Howth in\r\nIreland. The House of Lusignan, Melusina’s descendants, called it Aymar;\r\nand in this form it came to England with Henry III.’s half-brother, whom\r\nhe promoted to the see of Winchester, but who episcopally called himself\r\nEthelmarus; though his nephew, Aymar de Valence, kept his proper name.\r\nEmmery is a surviving English surname, and Merica occurs in old\r\nYorkshire genealogies.\r\n\r\nBut it is the Italian form, Amerigo, which was destined to the most\r\nnoted use,—when the adventurer, Amerigo Vespucci, gave his name to the\r\ntract of land that Columbus saw for the first time in his company;\r\nlittle knowing that it was no island, but a mighty continent, which\r\nshould hold fast that almost fortuitous title, whence thousands of\r\nmiles, and millions of men, bear the appellation of the forgotten\r\nforefather of a tribe of the Goths—Amalrich, the work ruler; a curiously\r\nappropriate title for the new world of labour and of progress, on the\r\nother side the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAmalberge is an old Cambrai name; Malburg a Danish one; Amalgund,\r\nAmalbert, Amalbertine, and Amalhild, have also been known. The French\r\nAmelot must be the contraction of one of the masculine forms.[120]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Kemble; _Int. to Beowulf_; Weber; Dugdale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION XVIII.—_Forefathers._\r\n\r\nThe deification of forefathers, or the claim to divine origin, whichever\r\nit might be, led to the employment, as a prefix, of the very word that\r\nexpressed them—that word which we use still at the beginning of\r\n_ancestors_, and that the Germans call _ahnen_. In old German the\r\nsingular was _ano_, and it signified a remote forefather. The\r\n_Rigsmaal_, an old Icelandic poem which explains the origin of the\r\nvarious castes which the northern races acknowledged, represents\r\nHeimdall, the porter of heaven, as wandering to the earth, and being\r\nentertained by Ai and Edda, or great-grandfather and great-grandmother,\r\nwho lived in a lowly hut; then by Avi and Amma (Lat. Avus), or\r\ngrandfather and grandmother, who had a comfortable dwelling-house; and\r\nlastly by Fadher and Modher, whose abode was a splendid mansion. The son\r\nof Edda was Thrall; the son of Amma was Karl; the son of Modher was\r\nJarl; and from these descended the three castes of the North—the\r\nthralls, or slaves; the churls, bondr, or farmers; and the jarls, or\r\nnobles.\r\n\r\nThis is an absolute mythic allegory by way of explanation of existing\r\ncircumstances; but the names therewith connected mostly survived, though\r\nthey refer to these mere embodiments of abstract ideas.\r\n\r\n_Ai_, or _ani_, enters into the composition of the Icelandic Anar,\r\nancestral warrior, and thus, no doubt, contributed to form our surname\r\nof Anson, which, like almost all our great naval names, thus traces back\r\nto some ancient viking, who has done us at least as much good as evil,\r\nby leaving us his sons to keep all other invaders from our shores.\r\n\r\nThe old Saxon histories call some of these enemies by the name of\r\nAnlaff, in particular the chief who visited King Æthelstan’s tent in a\r\nminstrel’s disguise, and betrayed himself by burying the guerdon that he\r\nwas too proud to keep. The same persons whom England called Anlaff, and\r\nIreland Amlaidh, were, in the North, Alafr, or Olafr, according to the\r\ncustom of pronouncing the diphthong _a_ like an _o_, and then so\r\nspelling it, _e.g._, Aasbiorn, Osbiorn. The latter syllable is _laf_ or\r\n_leif_, from the verb _lev_, the Anglo-Saxon _leafan_, our own _leave_.\r\nIt is a word that never is used as a commencement, and but rarely stands\r\nalone, though the North sometimes has a Leifr, and it is used in the\r\nsense of what is remaining. Anlaff, or Olaf, is thus what is left of his\r\nforefathers, his ancestor’s relic, and a very notable relic was the\r\ngallant king Olaf Trygveson, the prime hero of the _Heimskringla_, whose\r\nlast battle is so nobly described there. Scarcely less noble is his\r\nrelative, Olaf the saint, the ally of England, who fought her battles\r\nnear London-bridge, and has left his name to the church of St. Olave,\r\nnear the site of the battle, though, unluckily, English tongues made him\r\nSt. Toly. St. Olaf was over-harsh in his endeavours to introduce\r\nChristianity to his subjects, and perished in a war with the rebels,\r\nassisted by Knut of Denmark and England; but his name continued\r\nglorious, and another royal St. Olaf, in Sweden, assisted to make it one\r\nof the most national of Scandinavian names, even to the present day.\r\n\r\nIts Latinism is Oläus, and its contraction Ole, or, rather, this answers\r\nto the very old Aale, which, in its turn, answers to the Analo, Anilo,\r\nAnelo, of the old Germans.\r\n\r\n_Leif_, or _laf_, we shall often meet as a termination, both in the\r\nNorth and in Germany, where it generally becomes _leib_ or _lip_, and\r\nthen the modern Germans take it for _love_, and thus have changed the\r\nold Gottleip into Gottleib. In the North it has scarcely fared better,\r\nespecially in the case of Thorleif, or Thor’s relic, who changed from\r\nTholleiv to Thoddeiv, or Tadeiv, on the one hand, and on the other, to\r\nTellev, which, thanks to some classically-disposed clergyman, has been\r\nwritten Teleph, and referred to the Greek Telephus.\r\n\r\nOf the other names connected with the _Rigsmaal_, we find Edda, the\r\ngreat-grandmother, giving title to the ancient poem on cosmogony and\r\nmythology that may be regarded as the parent of all the northern songs.\r\nThrall was likewise, in spite of its meaning, used as a name.\r\n\r\nThe next generation, Avi, Amma, and the son Karl, are the prominent\r\nones. The equivalent of Karl, Bondr, a farmer, is now and then a\r\nnorthern name; but it is the great Frank Karling line whose names so\r\ncuriously answer to these.\r\n\r\nWere they of the middle class of landholders, and were they proud of it,\r\nand anxious to trace their connection back to the grandfather,\r\ngrandmother, and churl? Whether there were a Frank version of the\r\n_Rigsmaal_ we do not know, but the leading name of the family was Karl,\r\nthe churl (of which more in its relation to the cycle of Romance), and\r\nit is found in constant company with Amma, or Emma, and alternates with\r\none that almost certainly represented Avi, or grandfather.\r\n\r\nCharles, Pepin l'Heristal, Charles Martel, Pepin le Bref, Charles the\r\nGreat, is the succession till the alternation was broken by the death of\r\nPepin, the eldest son of Charles the Great. Now this most undignified\r\nPepin is traced by the best authorities to be one of the many forms of\r\nthe primitive and universal _abba_, father, papa, and to answer to the\r\nold German names of Bobo, Bobbo, and Poppo. And it is not, therefore,\r\nprobable that Pepin and Emma stood for the northern Avi and Amma, both\r\nalike with the son Karl?\r\n\r\nAmme, or Emma, no doubt formed by the first lispings of a child, is\r\n_amme_, a nurse, in Germany, and _ama_, a housekeeper, in Spain. As a\r\nname, it was at first exclusively Frank, and used by the Karling\r\ndaughters. The first Emma mentioned was the daughter of Charlemagne; and\r\nthe sister of Hugh Capet, who married Richard the Fearless, of Normandy,\r\nwas likewise so called. Her granddaughter was the wife, first of\r\nEthelred the Unready, then of Knut, and the supposed heroine of the\r\nordeal of the ploughshares. Emma was considered as so un-English that\r\nher name was translated into Ælfgifu. However, we find ‘Emme’ among the\r\ndaughters of Dru de Baladon, who came over with the Conqueror, and thus\r\n‘Emm’ and ‘Emr’ are by no means uncommon in the registers of Yorkshire\r\nand Durham, even down to the seventeenth century. Then Prior, when\r\nmodernizing and sentimentalizing the beautiful ballad of the _Nut Browne\r\nMaid_, supposed to be on the history of the shepherd Lord Clifford,\r\ncalled it Henry and Emma, whence it became rather a favourite romantic\r\nname of literature. Clergymen were apt to use it, in Latin registers, as\r\na translation of Amy, as well as of its own Em. It is also confounded\r\nwith Emily, and at the present day recurs extremely often in England,\r\nwhile it is almost disused in France, its native home. The Welsh use it\r\nas a translation of Ermin, probably a legacy of the Roman Herminii.\r\nEmmott is another old name of northern England, probably amplified from\r\nEm; but Emeline, as has been already said, is far more probably Amalina\r\nthan any relation to Emma.\r\n\r\nJarl, as might be expected, was a very favourite eponym; but not in the\r\nsame pronunciation; for it first became Irl, then Erl, in nomenclature.\r\nErling, a name much used by the Norsemen, and often corrupted into\r\nElling, is the son of the earl; and the Swedish once had a Jarlar, or\r\nearl-warrior, who changed into Erlher, Erlo, Erlebald, Erlebrecht,\r\nErlhild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n              NAMES FROM OBJECTS CONNECTED WITH MYTHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION I.—_Day._\r\n\r\nThe rich imagination of the North could not fail to preserve the Eastern\r\nmyths of natural appearances and animals with their myths, and these\r\nideas are as usual reflected in the names of the race.\r\n\r\nIn the _Edda_, Nôtt, or night, the dark, one of the Jotun, is the wife\r\nof Dellingr, the brilliant and beautiful, one of the Æsir, and their son\r\nis Dag or Day. Mother and son each have a chariot in which they career\r\nround the sky, in pursuit of one another. The horse of Day is Shinfaxi,\r\nof shining mane; the horse of Night is Hrimfaxi, rime or frost mane.\r\n\r\nDay had many namesakes, though more often at the end than the beginning\r\nof a word.\r\n\r\nDago, Tago, or Tajo, was a Gothic bishop of Zaragoza, whom King\r\nChindaswintha sent to Rome about 640, to bring home a copy of St.\r\nGregory’s _Comment on the Book of Job_, which had been dedicated to a\r\nKing of Spain, one of the Suevi, but had been lost in the irruption of\r\nthe Arian Goths. The Roman clergy had been equally careless. Pope\r\nTheodorus could not lay his hands upon the manuscript; and the search\r\nbecame so tedious, that finally Bishop Tajo betook himself to prayer,\r\nand obtained a special vision of the holy Pope Gregory himself, who\r\ndirected him to the depository of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThis same Dagr figures in the _Landnama-bok_; and the North has Dagfinn,\r\nperhaps once an allusion to the resplendent glory of Odin, but usually\r\ntranslated white as day. Dagulf, or Daulf, day-wolf, was no doubt in\r\nallusion to the wolf Sköll, who hunts the sun daily round the sky, and\r\nwill eat her up at last; whence to this day a parhelion is called in\r\nSweden a sun-wolf, Sololf. Eclipses are caused when the wolf gains on\r\nthe sun, who has no namesakes in Teuton nomenclature, the few that sound\r\nlike it being from another source, namely, _Salv_ or _sölv_, anointing\r\nor healing. The feminine _ny_, though meaning the new moon when standing\r\nalone, is only the adjective new, and means fresh and fair, so that the\r\nnorthern Dagny is, fair as day. The Norse ladies also have Dagheid or\r\nDageid, cheerful as day.\r\n\r\nDagobert, or bright as day, was that long-haired king who, next to\r\nClovis, impressed the French imagination. He was the employer of the\r\ngreat goldsmith St. Eloi, and the throne or chair of King Dagobert,\r\nascribed to that great artificer, is still in existence. A successor in\r\nthe _fainéant_ times was canonized, and together the two Dagoberts,\r\nmaking one, have become the theme first of heroic and then of burlesque\r\nin France. It was Takaperaht in Old German; and there, too, Tagarat, or\r\nDagrad, is to be found; but in general, _dag_ or _tac_ comes at the end\r\nof words.\r\n\r\nDagmar—the favourite queen of the Danes, whose only fault was lacing her\r\nsleeves on a Sunday—is called only by her epithet, Danes' joy. Her true\r\nname was Margaret of Bohemia, and the Danish princess Dagmar, who was\r\nchristened after her, was on her Russian marriage called Marie.[121]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  Blackwell, Mallet; Munch; Butler; Grimm; Thierry; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION II.—_The Wolf._\r\n\r\nIt is for the place that he occupies in the Teutonic imagination, rather\r\nthan for his own merits, that the wolf stands foremost among the\r\ncreatures that have supplied Teutonic names.\r\n\r\nHe is also the most universal. Zeeb, Lycos, and Lupus, have been already\r\nmentioned; and the midnight prowler, as the most terrible animal of\r\nEurope, held his place in imaginations, whence the lion and tiger faded\r\nfor want of personal acquaintance. The French have no less than\r\nforty-nine proverbs about wolves, many no doubt remains of the beast\r\nepic.\r\n\r\nWolves called Geri and Freki sat on either side of Odin’s throne, and\r\ndevoured his share of the bears' flesh of Valhalla, a banquet he was too\r\nethereal to require. Wolves chase the sun and moon round their daily\r\ncourses; and a terrible wolf called Mangarmr, or moon-gorger, is to\r\ndevour the moon at the coming of the wolf-age, which, in the _Voluspa_,\r\nshadows the last days of the world. Fenris, the wolf of the abyss, is\r\nthe son of Loki; and though bound by the Æsir at the cost of Tyr’s right\r\nhand, will finally break loose, destroy Odin himself, and only be rent\r\nasunder by Vidur in his resistless shoes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, _ulf_, _vulf_, _wolf_ was highly popular as a name-root;\r\nperhaps more common at the end than the beginning of a word, but often\r\nstanding alone. It was the diminutive Vulfila that was the right name of\r\nthat good bishop whose Mæso-Gothic version of the Gospels goes by his\r\nLatinism of Ulphilas.\r\n\r\nUlf was twenty-three times in the _Landnama-bok_; and _ulf_ in every\r\npossible form ravaged the coasts of Europe. _Wolf_ was again the\r\nhereditary prefix in the House of Bavaria, where the dukes varied\r\nbetween Wolf and Wolfart, till Wolfen became the designation of the\r\nfamily, and a legend was invented to account for it. An ancestress had,\r\nit was said, given birth to twelve infants all at once, and in the\r\nspirit of the child who, being shown his twin brothers, asked “Which\r\nshall we keep,” sent her maid to dispose of the eleven unnecessary ones\r\nin the river. The father met her, and asked what she had in her apron.\r\n“Only whelps,” she answered; but he was not to be thus put off, made an\r\ninspection, saved the children’s lives, and called them the Wolfen, or\r\nwolf-whelps! The _Book of Heroes_, however, makes the Wolfings descend\r\nfrom the brave Sir Hildebrand, and be so called from a wolf on their\r\nshield granted them by the Emperor Wolfdietrich, in remembrance of an\r\nadventure of his own infancy, when he had been carried off by a she-wolf\r\nto her den, and remained there unhurt—whence his name of Wolfdietrich.\r\nThe male line of the Wolfen, however, in time became extinct, and the\r\nheiress married one of the Italian House of Este, which adopted the\r\nGerman Wolf in the Italianized form of Guelfo, and constantly used it as\r\na name. Thence when the popes set up Otto d'Este, one of the Wolfen of\r\nBavaria, as anti-emperor in opposition to the House of Hohenstaufen, his\r\npartisans were called Welfen; those of the Fredericks, Waiblingen, from\r\nthe Swabian castle of Waibling. The Italian cities rang with the fierce\r\ncries of Guelfo and Zibelino, for the pope or the emperor, and Europe\r\nlearnt to identify the Guelph with the cause of the Church; the\r\nGhibelline with that of the State, when the origin of the words had long\r\nbeen forgotten.\r\n\r\nOne of the Bavarian Wolfen d'Este became Duke of Brunswick Luneburg, and\r\nfrom him descended the Hanoverian line of English sovereigns, who in the\r\ntime of Revolution thence were said to be properly sumamed Guelf, or\r\neven Whelps, with about as much correctness as when Louis XVI. was\r\nstyled Louis Capet.\r\n\r\nWe had a wolf among our sovereigns in the days of the Heptarchy, in\r\nVulfhere, king of Mercia, the same as the northern Ulfar, and German\r\nWolfer, meaning wolf-warrior. Also Vulfhilda was a sainted abbess in\r\nEngland, while Ulvhildur colonized Iceland. We had also Vulfred,\r\nVulfnoth, Vulfstein, better known as St. Wulstan, the admirable bishop\r\nof Worcester. These English wolves of ours have a great inclination to\r\nlapse into sheep’s clothing and become wool, in which form we use them\r\nin the harmless surnames of Woolgar, Woolstone, Woolmer, Wolsey.\r\n\r\nUlfketill, or Ulfkjell, as odd a compound as can well be found, was one\r\nof the pirates who invested England, but is a peaceable inhabitant in\r\nDomesday, where Ulf swarms, as Ulfac, Ulfeg, Ulfert, Ulfener, Ulfric;\r\njust as he does in the Iceland Domesday, as Ulfhedinn, Ulfherdur,\r\nUfliotr.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Wolfgang, perhaps best rendered as Wolf-progress, was a\r\nsainted bishop of Ratisbon, in the tenth century, whence this strange\r\nname flourished, and, coming to Göthe, became prized by all his\r\nadmirers. There, too, is Wolfram, the wolf-raven, Wolfrad, and Wolfert.\r\n\r\nSome have translated _ulf_, or _wolf_, at the end of a word by help; but\r\nthis is impossible, as though _hulf_ is help in German, the _f_ is the\r\nproperty of that language alone.\r\n\r\nA few of the Danes seem to have learnt to respect the qualities of the\r\nmagnificent Irish wolf-hound, whose qualities are highly praised in the\r\n_Heimskringla_. Then they took to calling themselves Hunde; and a son of\r\nSigurd, Earl of Orkney, is called both Hvalp and Hund. The name of\r\nHundolf is, however, supposed to be either hardened from Hun, or else to\r\nbe from a word meaning booty or plunder, so as to mean the wolf of\r\nplunder.[122]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Turner, _Anglo-Saxons_; Blackwell, Mallet; _Dictionnaire des\r\n  Proverbes Français_; Sismondi, _Republiques Italianes_; Anderson,\r\n  _Genealogies_; Lappenburn, _Anglo-Saxons_; Alban Butler; Marryat,\r\n  _Jutland_; Pott.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION III.—_Eber, the Boar._\r\n\r\nThe boar, whom we found so popular in Roman nomenclature, is equally so\r\namong the southern Teutons, among whom the tusky boar was one of the\r\nprime beasts of chase. The Romans apparently viewed him and his titles\r\nin their domestic aspect; but the Teutons honoured the fierce _Eber_ of\r\ntheir forests as their highest and most dangerous prey, and gave him a\r\nplace among their mythology.\r\n\r\nFreyr had a boar with golden bristles, called Gullenbörsti, and when the\r\ncorn waved in the wind, the saying was, “Freyr’s boar is passing by.”\r\nEpurhelm, an old German name, was thus an appeal to the protection of\r\nFreyr.\r\n\r\nThe boar Sehrimnar was likewise the future feast of the brave in\r\nValhall, daily hunted and eaten, and as often resuscitated for the next\r\nday’s sport and banquet. Scandinavia lay too far north for his porcine\r\nmajesty; and the Norsemen had no personal acquaintance with him in their\r\ndaily life, whatever they might look forward to; and thus _Eber_, the\r\nwild boar, does not figure in their nomenclature, and scarcely among our\r\nown insular Saxons, though he is said to have ranged our forests.\r\n\r\nBut turning to the Goths, we fall at once upon Ebroinus, an evident\r\nclassicalism of Eberwine, not so much the boar’s friend, as Freyr’s\r\nfriend. Ebrimuth, another early Goth, is wild boar’s mood or wrath, and\r\nin Visigothic Spain we find Eborico, namely, Eberik, boar ruler.\r\n\r\nFrankland produced the formidable compound of boarwolf, Eberulf; but its\r\ntwo owners grew up monastic saints in the sixth and seventh centuries,\r\nand were honoured by the French as SS. Evrault, Evrols, Evrou, or\r\nEvraud. The second of these saints was a native of Normandy, and is\r\npatron of the abbey of Fontévraud, the burial-place of Henry II. and\r\nRichard Cœur de Lion, and the noblest nunnery in France.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, however, to distinguish between the forms of the French\r\nEberulf, and the German Eberhard, who was abbot of Einsiedlen in 934;\r\nindeed, it is highly probable that the Norman St. Evrhault, though\r\nderived from a saint Latinized as Eberulfus, and in German called Erulf,\r\nwas supposed to be the same as Eberhard, and that this accounts for the\r\nEnglish form of Everard, which sprung up from the four Evrards of the\r\nDomesday roll after the Conquest. Eberhard hardly reaches the rank of\r\nsaint in the Roman calendar; but his exertions in a great famine that\r\nravaged Alsace, Burgundy, and Upper Germany, in 942, account for the\r\nnationality of his name in all that region.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │   Italian.    │   Frisian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Everard        │Everardo       │Evart          │Eberhard       │\r\n   │Ewart          │Eberardo       │Evert          │Ebert          │\r\n   │               │Ebbo           │               │Ewart          │\r\n   │    ——————     │     —————     │    ——————     │Eppo           │\r\n   │    French.    │    Dutch.     │     Lett.     │Ebbo           │\r\n   │Evraud         │               │               │Ebo            │\r\n   │Ebles          │Everhard       │Ewarts         │Ebilo          │\r\n   │               │Evert          │Ebbo           │Ebin           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Etto           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Uffo           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Uppo           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Appo           │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Germans likewise have a feminine from this ‘boarfirm’ word\r\nEberbardine, contracted into Ebertine, or Ebba, and in Frisian, Ebbe or\r\nJebbe. I am afraid these German forms do not certainly account for the\r\nSaxon Ebba, or Æbbe, sister of St. Oswald, and foundress of the famous\r\npriory of Coldingham. However, England had one St. Eberhilda, who was a\r\npupil of St. Wilfrid, and foundress of a monastery called Everidisham,\r\nthe locality of which cannot be discovered; but the abbess must have\r\nleft an impression on the ladies of the North, to judge by the frequency\r\nof the occurrence of Everilda, which, with the contractions of Averilla\r\nand Averil, is not yet extinct.\r\n\r\nOffa, the Low German legendary hero—is very probably called by a\r\ncontraction of the wild boar. His name is repeated by the king of\r\nMercia, who seems to have borrowed somewhat of the legend in his story,\r\nand Offa was not extinct even in Domesday.\r\n\r\nEbermund, a Neustrian Frank of Meerwing days, was founder of Fontenoy\r\nAbbey, and was honoured as St. Evrémond, whence the territorial surname\r\nfamiliar to readers of French memoirs.\r\n\r\nSt. Evre, who is frankly Latinized into Sanctus Aper, was the seventh\r\nbishop of Toul, where the register of bishops presents a curious\r\nsuccession of wild beasts, and some of the Ebbos and Affos of Germany\r\nmay be his rightful property, though they are now all turned over to the\r\ncharitable Eberhard of Einsiedlen. Eburbero, or Boar-bear, seems to have\r\nbeen a German invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION IV.—_The Bear._\r\n\r\nThe bear does not enter into the legends of the _Edda_, but he enjoyed\r\nimmense regard in the North, and was looked on as a sort of ancestor, to\r\nwhom, when he was killed, polite apologies were always made, and who is\r\nstill called by the pet name of the Wise Man, rather than by his own\r\nproper term. Even in France he was mysteriously alluded to as le _vieux_\r\nor le _grand père_; and probably the Swiss veneration for the bears of\r\nBerne partly originated in the general devotion to the deliberate and\r\nalmost human-looking plantigrade.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons made Beorn the great-grandson of Wuotan, and the\r\nancestor of the kings of Beornland; in Latin Bernicia, or Beornia,\r\nafterwards the earldom that gave title to Richard, son of William I.\r\nLegend again declared that the stout old Earl Siward Bìorn was actually\r\nthe offspring of a bear, and that the ears of his parent might have been\r\nfound concealed beneath his matted locks.\r\n\r\nNorway and Iceland are, as in duty bound, the land of bears, but the\r\nPyrenees had their share likewise; and if the North has Bjornulf, the\r\nsame bear-wolf reigned over Gothic Spain in the form of Vernulfo; and in\r\nthe Asturias and Navarre, the bear’s mood was dreaded as Bermudo, or\r\nVermudo, and his protecting hand sought as Veremundo.\r\n\r\nIn the Pyrenees, too, flourished the bear-spear, the same with the\r\nnorthern Bjorngjer, though southern tongues made Berenger and\r\nBerengario, in which forms it was owned by many a mountain king of\r\nNavarre and count of Roussillon, Barcelona, or Toulouse. There, too, it\r\nformed the feminine Berenguela, and this, as princesses' names always\r\ndo, travelled farther; for Berenguela was queen of Castille, and mother\r\nof St. Fernando; another Berenguela, or Berangère, as French tongues\r\ncalled her, is familiar to us under that most incorrect historical title\r\nof Berengaria, the bride of Richard Cœur de Lion. Another Berenguela,\r\nwho from Portugal married the king of Denmark, so misconducted herself\r\nthat Bjorngard or Berngard, the Danish version of her name, stands for\r\nan abandoned woman.\r\n\r\nBiorn of the fiery eyes was appropriately named by Fouqué; for the\r\n_Landnama-bok_ shows forty-two Biorns, and the name is still common in\r\nNorway and Iceland, where also are found still, as man’s names, Bersi\r\nand Besse, also titles of the bear, and Bera by way of feminine.\r\nBjornhedinn is also northern, and there are numerous varieties of\r\ncompounds, one of them rather of late date being Bjornstern, bear-star,\r\nprobably in reference to the Pole-star. One of the present authors in\r\nNorway bears the fierce name of Bjornsternja Bjornsen.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all the bears is, however, of Frank growth. Some have\r\ntried to resolve it into Bairn-heart, child-hearted; but though _barn_\r\nis of most ancient lineage, found even in Ulfilas’s Gospels, all analogy\r\nis against the interpretation; and there can be no doubt that when the\r\nfirst historical Biornhard was named, his parents would much have\r\npreferred his having the resolution of a bear rather than the heart of a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThat first was an uncle of Charlemagne, and from him it was that the\r\nmountain, erst of Jupiter, was termed of Bernard, even before a second\r\nBernard, surnamed De Menthon, fled from his home for love of a monastic\r\nlife, and erected his noble hospice for the reception of travellers.\r\nThen came further glory to the name through the Cistercian monk, whose\r\npure character was revered by all in the thirteenth century, until his\r\nbecame a universal name throughout Europe; in Ireland absorbing the\r\nnative Brian. In Spain, too, Bernardo del Carpio is a great legendary\r\nchampion, nephew to king Alfonso II. of Leon, and who, in the battle of\r\nRoncevalles, was said to have squeezed Roland the paladin to death in\r\nhis arms. Bernal Diaz is the simple-hearted chronicler of Cortes.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Bernard        │Bernard        │Bernardo       │Bernardo       │\r\n   │Barnard        │Bernadin       │Bernadino      │Bernal         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │  Wallachian   │    German.    │    Dutch.     │\r\n   │Bernaldo       │Bernardu       │Bernhard       │Bernhart       │\r\n   │Bernadim       │               │Berend         │Barend         │\r\n   │               │               │Benno          │Barndt         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Frisian.    │   Lusatian.   │   Lettish.    │     Esth.     │\r\n   │Bernd          │Bernat         │Berents        │Pero           │\r\n   │   ————————    │   ————————    │Berns          │Perent         │\r\n   │    Slovak.    │  Hungarian.   │               │               │\r\n   │Bernardek      │Bernät         │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nIt has the German feminine Bernhardine.

Berwart, abbot of Hildesheim; Bernclo, the\r\nBavarian bear’s claw; Berner, and many others where _bern_ or _pern_\r\nends the word.\r\n\r\nBahrend, Berndt, Behr, Behring, all are surnames from the bear in\r\nGermany, and the last very appropriately named Behring’s Straits. It is\r\nthe same that came to England as Baring.[123]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Lappenburg; Pott; Michaelis; Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION V.—_The Horse._\r\n\r\nNo sacred animal was in more request than the horse. The gods had their\r\nwonderful horses. Sleipner (the Slider) was the eight-footed steed of\r\nOdin; Gullfaxi, or gold mane, belonged to the giant Hrimgrim; and the\r\nshining-maned and hoary-maned coursers of day and night have been\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe eastern origin of the Teutons was never more shown than by their\r\nhomage to horses. Beautiful and choice white steeds were reserved for\r\nthe gods, drawing the waggons that conveyed the images, when the army\r\nwent out to battle, or a colony migrated; and omens were derived from\r\ntheir neighings when alive, and from their heads when killed in\r\nsacrifice. Great sacrifices of horses were made on solemn occasions, and\r\nfeasts were made upon their flesh as a religious rite, so that the\r\nabstaining from horse-flesh became absolutely a test of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe horse was the national emblem of the Saxons; and Henghist and Horsa\r\nare both old Teuton names for the animal, the first surviving in the\r\nGerman _hengst_ and northern _hest_, the last in our ordinary word\r\n_horse_: while the High German _hross_ has fallen into the modern\r\n_ross_. White horses cut out in the chalky hill-sides of southern\r\nEngland from time immemorial, attest the antiquity of the symbol still\r\nclaimed by the county of Kent, and by the Anglian-Continental kingdom of\r\nHanover.\r\n\r\nIn the old poem of _Beowulf_, however, Hengist is a Dane, invading and\r\noppressing Finn of Friesland, and afterwards slain. It is possible,\r\nthen, that Hengist may after all be a mere mythic name erected into an\r\nancestor by the Kentish monarchs. Some have tried to derive _hross_ from\r\n_horen_, to hear or obey, in honour of the noble creature’s obedience;\r\nbut it is in fact only another form of the _ashva_ of India, to which\r\nἵππος, _equus_, and the Keltic _each_ have been traced; and it is\r\ncurious to find that Brittany preserves the word _ronse_, as does Spain\r\n_ronzin_, the term that Don Quixote magnified into the magnificent\r\ndesignation of Rosinante.\r\n\r\nThe nation that sat round their cauldrons and feasted solemnly on\r\nhorse-flesh might well call their sons Rossketyl, or Rosskjell. Three\r\nare to be found in the _Landnama-bok_, and Roskil is not extinct in\r\nDenmark. The agreeable title of Hrossbiorn, or horse-bear, is there to\r\nbe found likewise, and Saxo-Grammaticus dignifies as Rostiophus, a\r\ngentleman who was properly called by the term of Hrossthiof, or\r\nhorse-thief.\r\n\r\nHrossbert formed into Rospert, Hroshelm into Roselm, Hrosmod into\r\nRosmund, Hrosswald, or horse-power, into Roswal, who was the hero of a\r\nScottish poem called _Roswal and Lilian_. He is the disinherited heir of\r\nNaples; and, after a series of troubles, fights his way back to honour\r\nand the hand of Lilian, the fair princess of Bealn.\r\n\r\nThe feminines Hrossmund, Hroswith, Hroshild, Hrosa, have by general\r\nconsent been changed from horses to roses, giving up the old idea of the\r\nValkyr on her tall shadowy horse, weaving her web of victory, and have\r\nbeen treated of under the head of Latin flowers.\r\n\r\nHengst seems to have been used for the male, horse for the female; but\r\n_jor_ in the North, _ehu_ in Old German, _ehvus_ in Gothic, meant both\r\nhorse and mare; and this _jor_, or sometimes only the _jo_, is not\r\nuncommon in Norsk names, as Jogeir, Jofred, Jogrim, Jostein, or flower\r\nof chivalry, Johar or Joar, horse warrior, Joketyll, or Jokell. The\r\nwomen were, Jora, Jodis, Jofrid, Joreid, Jorunna, all, be it remembered,\r\nbeing pronounced as with a _y_.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Justin devoured Jostein, and George probably consumed some of\r\nthe others; indeed, some of the early specimens of Jordan among the\r\nNormans, probably accommodated their names to the river in their\r\ncrusading fervour; but, _en revanche_, the great Gothic historian,\r\nJornandes, is supposed to have been so called by corruption from his\r\nstate name of Jordanes.\r\n\r\nJorund, which looks very like one of this race, is referable to another\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nProbably in honour of Thor’s he-goats we find the goat figuring in\r\nnames, as Geitwald, Geithilt, and the wife of Robert Guiscard,\r\nSichelgaita.[124]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Munter; Munch; Dasent; Cambro-Briton; Blackwell, Mallet; Weber\r\n  and Jamieson, _Northern Romance_; Sturleson, _Heimskringla_; Kemble\r\n  _Beowulf_; Ellis, _Specimens of Early English Poetry_; Pott, _Personen\r\n  Namen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VI.—_The Eagle._\r\n\r\n‘There is an eagle sitting on the ash Yggdrasil who knows many things.’\r\n\r\nHe is, in the North, _aar_, in Germany _ar_, in Scotland _erne_: though\r\nwe and the modern Germans use, in _eagle_ and _adler_, mere contractions\r\nof the Latin _aquila_. Places named from the king of birds are found\r\nwherever there are mountains.\r\n\r\nHis influence on nomenclature was exercised from the Dovrefeld and from\r\nthe Alps, for the eagle-names are chiefly either Scandinavian or High\r\nGerman; we do not seem to have any native English ones.\r\n\r\nThe most noted of these southern ones are Arnwald, eagle power, and\r\nArnulf, or eagle-wolf, and it is very difficult to distinguish their\r\nderivatives from one another. The saint of the Roman calendar was\r\ncertainly Arnulf, a prince of the long-haired line, who in 614 retired\r\ninto a convent at Metz, and became its bishop, when alive, and its\r\npatron, when dead. Another previous Arnulf, after whom he was probably\r\nchristened, for their day is the same, was martyred by the heathen\r\nFranks, about the time of the conversion of Clovis; and a subsequent one\r\nwas bishop of Soissons, under Pope Hildebrand. Arnoul was common as a\r\nname among the Burgundian kings, and was known in Italy as Arnolfo; but\r\nit has been swallowed up by Arnwald, or Arnvalldr, as he is in the\r\nNorth, perhaps because this latter was made famous in Provence by\r\nArnaldo di Maraviglia, the troubadour; in Italy by the unfortunate\r\nArnoldo of Brescia, and later in Switzerland by the patriot Arnold von\r\nMelchthal, and thus it has become popular enough to have the feminines\r\nArnolde and Arnoldine.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Arnold         │Arnaud         │Arnoldo        │Arnoldo        │\r\n   │               │Arnaut         │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Dutch.     │    North.     │               │\r\n   │Arnold         │Arnoldus       │Arnvalld       │               │\r\n   │Arno           │Arnoud         │Arnalldr       │               │\r\n   │Ahrent         │Arend          │               │               │\r\n   │Ahrens         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Arold          │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Arnolds and Arnoldines keep their feast upon St. Arnulf’s day, thus\r\nconfessing that they have no patron of their own. Ernulf is an old form\r\nfound in Domesday Book, and not yet quite extinct.\r\n\r\nThe northern eagles are much confused by _arin_, a hearth, the same\r\nwhich is found at the end of Thorarin. It contracts into _arn_ at the\r\nbeginning of a word, so that, except when we meet with it in full, as in\r\nthe case of the brave old sea-king, Arinbiorn, the hearth-bear, it is\r\ndifficult to tell to which to send the owner, to the _eyrie_ or the\r\n_fire-side_. And further, _arn_ and _arin_ both contract\r\nindiscriminately into _ar_ and _an_, so that the list of Northern names\r\nis given rather in the dark. They are both masculine and feminine, for\r\nArna was both used standing alone and as a termination.\r\n\r\nArnridur or Arneidur, eagle haste, one of these eagle ladies, had a\r\ncurious history told in the _Landnama-bok_. She was the daughter of\r\nAsbiorn, a jarl in the Hebrides, and was taken captive by Holmfast\r\nVedormson, who sold her to an Icelander named Ketell Thrymr. He was so\r\nmuch smitten with her as to pay for her twice the sum demanded by old\r\nVedorm; but before the departure for Iceland, she found a quantity of\r\nsilver beneath the roots of a tree, sufficient for her ransom. Instead\r\nof claiming it, her new master generously gave her the choice of\r\npurchasing her freedom or remaining his wife; she chose the latter\r\nalternative, and stands as honourable women do in the _Landnama-bok_, as\r\nthe mother of a house in Iceland.\r\n\r\nArnthor, and his feminine Arnthora, contract into Arnor and Arnora, and\r\nthis latter explains Annora, to be found in Norman pedigrees. Annora was\r\nwife of Bernard de St. Valery; and was carried into the family of Braose\r\nby king John’s victim, Maude de St. Valery, who called one of her\r\ndaughters Annora. It is also said that Anora is only the contraction of\r\nEleanora.\r\n\r\nAri was an adventurer who sailed to Greenland in fourteen days, fifteen\r\nyears before the preaching of Christianity in Iceland.\r\n\r\nThe other old Icelandic and Norsk forms are:—\r\n\r\n    Arnbiorg, eagle defence;\r\n    Arndis, eagle sprite;\r\n    Arnfinn, white eagle;\r\n    Arnfridur, eagle fair one;\r\n    Arngeir, eagle war;\r\n    Arngrimm, } or Angrim,\r\n    Arngrimur, } eagle mask;\r\n    Arnkatla, } eagle cauldron;\r\n    Arnkjell, }\r\n    Arnlaug, eagle liquor;\r\n    Arnleif, eagle relic;\r\n    Arnliotr, eagle wanderer;\r\n    Arnmodur  } eagle wrath;\r\n    or Armodr,}}\r\n    Arnstein, eagle stone;\r\n    Arnthrudr, eagle maiden.\r\n\r\nThis Ari, be he eagle or hearth, seems to conduct us to the source of\r\nthe first syllable of Arabella. The first lady so called, whom I can\r\ndetect, was Arabella, the granddaughter of William the Lion, of\r\nScotland, who married Robert de Quinci. Another Arabella, with her\r\nhusband John de Montpynçon, held the manor of Magdalen Laver in the\r\nthirty-ninth of Henry III., and thus it was evidently a Norman name. The\r\nNormans made wild work with all that did not sound like French, and\r\ntheir Latin secretaries made the matter worse, so that I am much tempted\r\nto believe that both Arabella and that other perplexing name, Annabella,\r\nmay once have been Arnhilda, cut down into Arbell, or Anable, and then\r\namplified. “My Lady Arbell” was certainly what the lady was called, in\r\nher own time, whose misfortunes are so well known to us, under the name\r\nof Arabella Stuart, and from whom Arabella has been adopted in various\r\nfamilies, and is usually contracted by Belle. Some have made it\r\nArabella, or fair altar, others the diminutive of Arab, both equally\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nThe most common form of Arn at present used in Scandinavia is Arnvid,\r\nthe eagle of the wood, often contracted into Arve.\r\n\r\nWith much doubt I question whether the name of Ernest should not be\r\nadded to this catalogue. It is obvious to take its native German form,\r\nErnst, from _ernst_, earnest, grave, or serious, but this is quite\r\nunlike the usual analogy of such names. Arnust was the older German form\r\nof the name, and some even think that this was the proper name of\r\nAriovistus, the German chief who fought with Cæsar, though others\r\nconsider this to be Cæsar’s version of Heerfurst, or general, and others\r\nthink they detect the universal root _ar_, husbandry.\r\n\r\nThe more certain form of the name begins in Lombardy, where Ernesto,\r\nlord of Este, was killed in battle by kinFg Astolfo, in 752. Is not\r\nErnesto just what Italy would make of Arnstein, after fancying that\r\nArnstino was a diminutive? Then, over the mountains, comes Arnust I.,\r\nduke of Swabia, in right of his wife, in 1012, and Arnust the Strenuous,\r\nMarkgraff of Austria, from whom Ernst spread all over Germany,\r\nespecially after the Reformation, when Ernst, Duke of Brunswick, had\r\nstriven so hard to spread Lutheranism among his subjects that\r\nProtestants called him the Confessor.\r\n\r\nThis is now one of the most national of German names, and it is working\r\nits way into England, though not yet with a naturalized sound. Its\r\nGerman feminine, Ernestine, is one of the many contracted by Stine and\r\nTine, or by Erna.

Hauk Habrok was a noted pirate; and\r\nthere are two Haukrs in the _Landnama-bok_. The bird is now called _hog_\r\nin Denmark, and most of our families named Hogg are supposed to rejoice\r\nin Hawk as an ancestor.\r\n\r\nAs to Folco and his kin, though it is often attributed to the falcon, it\r\nhas, as we shall see, quite another source.[125]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Munch; Pott; Michaelis; Butler; _Landnama-bok_; Chalmers;\r\n  _Essex Pedigrees_; Dugdale; Anderson, _Genealogies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VII.—_The Raven._\r\n\r\nFerocious and predatory nations love and admire even the raven that\r\nscents slaughter from afar, and is the comrade and emblem of the\r\nbattle-field. So as Oreb and Zeeb were among the Bedouin desolators of\r\nIsrael, Hraben and Ulf were among the wasters of Christendom.\r\n\r\nTwo ravens, Mind and Memory, go forth throughout the world, then\r\nreturning and perching on Odin’s shoulders, reveal to him all that\r\npasses on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe raven seems to have been the special mark of Odin, and sometimes\r\nused for Thor; for amulets have been found in Sweden and Denmark, where\r\na raven flies before the mounted figure of Odin, and again is seen in\r\ncompany with the hammer of Thor. And who does not know the raven banner\r\nof the sons of Ragnar, denoting probably their family _dis_, which\r\nflapped its wings before victory and drooped them before defeat?\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that the raven has left traces in the nomenclature of\r\nTeutonic Europe, though it is not always easy to distinguish its progeny\r\nfrom those of _ragn_, judgment, and _rand_, a house.\r\n\r\nThe raven, in his harshest croak, entitled the Frank sovereign Chramne,\r\nwho is hard to recognize as the near kinsman of the sixteen Rafns of the\r\n_Landnama-bok_, and Rabanus Maurus, the Latinism of the learned\r\narchbishop of Mainz of the ninth century.\r\n\r\nHrafenhilldur, a suitable title for a Valkyr, and Hrafenkell also figure\r\nin the _Landnama-bok_, and in Domesday stand Ravengar and Ravenswar,\r\nshowing the transition from the _gjer_, or spear, down to our word war.\r\n\r\nRafnulf is northern, but has been mixed up with the derivatives of\r\nRandolf. Rambert, successor of St. Ansgar, in Holstein, was a bright\r\nraven, Rampold a raven prince, and the Italian form Ramusio may be\r\nanother variety; but in general the raven comes at the end of words as\r\nin Wolfram, Valdraban, Bertram, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VIII.—_The Swan._\r\n\r\nThe swan might well figure prominently in the northern mythology,\r\nfamiliar as she was, as the fair creature of the autumn, when huge\r\nsquadrons of the whistling swan fly southwards, athwart the darkened\r\nheavens and pine forests, making the air resound with the solemn beat of\r\ntheir heavy wings, and their deep peculiar cry.\r\n\r\nTwo swans, parents of all those who dwell on earth, had their home in\r\nthe holy spring of Urd, beneath the world-tree, Yggdrasil; and the power\r\nand fierceness of these magnificent, pure, calm-looking birds connected\r\nthem with the Valkyrer, who were supposed to have swan wings, and to be\r\nable to change themselves into swans. When the Valkyrier began to pass\r\ninto mere magic ladies, they preserved their power of changing into\r\nswans, and by-and-by had swan garments, which they put off when they\r\nwished to assume human shapes, and which were now and then captured by\r\nsome happy mortal, who thus won the owner for his bride. Swanhvit, or\r\nSwan white, was thus the suitable name of one of the three Valkyrier who\r\nmarried the sons of Vidja in the Vilkina Saga.\r\n\r\nThe swan transformations appear again in the beautiful tale, common to\r\nall Teutonic countries, of the twelve princes transformed into swans,\r\nand of the faithful sister who redeemed them by the nettle shirts that\r\nshe wove, ever in silence, through every vicissitude of life even to the\r\nverge of death.\r\n\r\nSvana is an Icelandic name, also Svanlaug, a swan ocean, which has\r\ncontracted to Svallaug. Svanhild was used both by Norway and Germany,\r\nbeing Swanahilda in the latter, and Svanaburg and Swangarde were also\r\nthere; but it is strange that so pretty a word for a white-skinned\r\nmaiden should not have been more frequent. The Erse Gelges imitates the\r\nsense, but we have no English swan ladies, for Swanhals was only the\r\nepithet of the often commemorated lady, who is said to have discovered\r\nthe corpse of Harold of Hastings.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the swans were left to womankind; but the Germans had\r\na Swanbrecht and Swanahold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION IX.—_The Serpent._\r\n\r\nEither from terror, or from a shadowy remembrance of the original\r\ntemptation, the implanted enmity between the serpent and man has often\r\nresulted in a species of worship.\r\n\r\nThe North believed in the Jörmungandr, or Midgardsorm, the serpent that\r\nencircled the world and was one of the monstrous progeny of Loki.\r\n\r\nAnd even till late in the seventh century the Lombards had a golden\r\nimage of an enormous viper to which they sacrificed, until St. Barbatus\r\nrecovered them from the heathenism into which they had relapsed.\r\n\r\nOne species of ship among the Northmen was called serpent. It was long\r\nand low, with the gilded head of a dragon at the prow, a long tail\r\nraised and curling over the stern, while with coloured shields ranged\r\nalong the sides, and thirty oars on either side propelling it, besides\r\nthe winged sails, it must have been more like a water-dragon than any\r\ncreature that has ploughed the waves since the Plesiosaurus, and this\r\nprobably accounts for the prevalence of the name of Orm among the\r\nnorthern nations.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two Ormrs appear in the _Landnama-bok_; Orm and Ormar (_Ger._\r\nWurmhar) are both in Domesday. Orm was the founder of the Scottish house\r\nof Abernethy. Homer was considered, by the Danes of the middle ages, as\r\nthe translation into Latin of the name of Ormr.\r\n\r\nOrmilda is likewise a northern name, and it is not quite impossible that\r\nOphelia may have been a translation of one of these serpent-names by the\r\nGreek ὄφις (ophis); at any rate the fair Ophelia shows no precedents for\r\nher name, and no other derivation for it occurs. The gentle maiden, with\r\nher most touching fate, is altogether an invention of Shakespeare, for\r\nthough a woman appears in the old story of Amleth, she is of far other\r\nmould, and Ophelia may have been merely devised by himself. If so it is\r\ncurious that he should have placed her in the chief land of serpentine\r\nnames. A few lovers of its sound have used it in England and America.\r\n\r\n_Lind_ is another term for a serpent. The German dragons are always\r\ncalled _lindwurmer_, and the word is, in fact, the same as that which we\r\nstill use as _lithe_, expressing supple grace; the adjective _linths_\r\nbecoming, on the one side _lind_, on the other _lithe_. The Spaniards\r\nuse _lindo_, _linda_, for pretty, with about the same difference of\r\nsense, in the masculine or feminine, as we do when we speak of a pretty\r\nwoman, or a pretty man. Norse poetry considered it a compliment to\r\ncompare a gaily dressed lady to a glistening serpent, and thus the idea\r\nseems to have passed from the reptile to the woman, so that, though the\r\nGerman Lintrude is the only instance of a commencing _lind_, the word is\r\none of the most common of all terminations among German and Italian\r\nnames, and dropping its _d_, so as to become _linn_, was made to serve\r\nas a favourite feminine diminutive, its relation to the Spanish _linda_,\r\nfair, keeping up its reputation. Thus we have Rosalind, or Rosaline,\r\nEthelind, and many more of the same kind.[126]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Mallet; Grimm; Chalmers; Laing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION X.—_Kettle._\r\n\r\nAmong mythological objects the kettle or cauldron can hardly be omitted;\r\ncertainly the very quaintest of human names, but perhaps referring\r\noriginally to the cauldron of creation, and afterwards to the\r\nsacrificial cauldrons that boiled the flesh of the victims at the great\r\n_blots_ or sacrifices.\r\n\r\nIn the North, the vessel is _ketil_; in old German, _chezil_; in\r\nEnglish, _cytel_; but the names from it seem to be almost entirely\r\nnorthern, though the cauldron is certainly the _olla_, so common a\r\nbearing in Spanish heraldry, and there at present regarded as the token\r\nof a large following, beneficently fed, somewhat in the same spirit as\r\nthat in which the Janissaries used a camp kettle as their ensign.\r\n\r\nKetyl was the Norwegian conqueror of the Hebrides, and founder of the\r\nline of Jarls, of the Western Isles; and the family of Ketyl was very\r\nfamous in Iceland, holding in honour an ancestor called Ketyl Hæng, from\r\n_hæng_, a bull trout; because when his father asked what he had been\r\ndoing, he answered, “I am not going to make a long story of every fish I\r\nsee leap; but true it is, that I chopped a bull trout asunder in the\r\nmiddle,” which trout turned out to be a great dragon.\r\n\r\nKatla was Ketyl’s feminine, and not uncommon. The Eyrbiggia Saga tells\r\nwonderful stories of a sorceress so called, who, when her son was in\r\ndanger from his enemies, made him appear first like a distaff, then like\r\na tame kid, and, lastly, like a hog, but all in vain, for her spells\r\nwere disconcerted by a rival sorceress, and she herself stoned to death.\r\n\r\nKetel does not often stand at the beginning of a word; but Ketelbiorn\r\nand Ketelridur are both Iceland names, and both the masculine and\r\nfeminine are very common terminations; the masculine being, however,\r\ngenerally contracted into Kjel, and then into _kill_ or _kel_.[127]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION XI.—_Weapon Names._\r\n\r\nWeapons were so nearly divine, so full of the warlike temper of their\r\nowners, and so often endowed with powers of their own, that it seemed as\r\nif they themselves were living agents in the deeds wrought with them.\r\n\r\nThe sword forged by supernatural smiths, the terrific helmet, the\r\nheavenly shield, are dreams of every warlike nation, either endowing the\r\nDeity with the symbols of protection or wrath or of might, or carrying\r\non the tradition of some weapon which, either its own intrinsic\r\nsuperiority or the prowess of its owner, had made an object of\r\nenthusiasm or of terror.\r\n\r\nSome of these tales of magic weapons are perhaps, as Mr. Campbell\r\nsuggests, remnants of the days when the iron age was coming in, and the\r\nmass of arms being of brass, one iron sword, “a sword of light,” as\r\nGaelic tales call it, would have given irresistible superiority to its\r\nwielder, and even, perhaps, earned the worship that was paid by Attila’s\r\nHuns to the naked sword.\r\n\r\nIt accords with this theory that Iron appears as a component part of\r\nnumerous names in Germany, and probably likewise in Scandinavia, though\r\nthere the similarity of the sound to _Iis_, ice, occasions a doubt\r\nwhether the word was intended for ice, or for iron. The North has,\r\nindeed, the cold but not inappropriate Snæulf and Snæbiorn, Snæfrid,\r\nsnow peace, and even the uncomfortable Snælaug; and when their language\r\nhad dropped the form _eisarn_ for the metal, and called it _jern_, as we\r\ndo iron, they probably transferred to ice the meaning of the names that\r\nonce meant iron.\r\n\r\nIsa is an old German feminine. Isambart, or iron splendour, is the best\r\nknown of all the varieties, having been used in France as Ysambar, and\r\ntravelled to England as the suitable baptismal name of the two\r\nengineers, to whom so much of our ‘iron splendour’ is due. Its German\r\ncontractions are Isabert and Isbert.\r\n\r\n      ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n      │ Nor. Isgeir; Ger. Isegar, Isgar—Iron spear │\r\n      │   Nor. Isbrand; Ger.

To say nothing of the Seax, whether stone or stone knife of\r\nour ancestral Seaxnot, we find the North using the word Stein, both\r\nalone and as a prefix and suffix; while in England, though it is not\r\nvery frequent, we have it in the honoured names of Athelstan and\r\nWulstan.\r\n\r\n          Norwegian\r\n\r\n          Stein,       }\r\n          Sten (_Dan._), } stone.\r\n          Steinarna, stone eagle.\r\n          Steinbjorn, stone bear.\r\n          Steinfinn, white stone.\r\n          Steingrimm, stone helmet.\r\n          Steinhar, } stone warrior.\r\n          Steinar,  }\r\n          Steinthor, } stone of Thor.\r\n          Steindor,  }\r\n\r\n          Steinulf, stone wolf. Steinvar, stone prudence.\r\n\r\nAnother old word for stone is _hall_, much used in the North; and in a\r\nfew cases, such as that of the Scottish Halbert, or Hobbie, creeping to\r\nour island with its Danish invaders; but except in this, and a few\r\nsurnames, unknown away from the North, save for the Hallar, or stone\r\nwarrior, of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe northern varieties, however, had much reputation in their own\r\ncountry. Hallgerda is in the Njal Saga the haughty wife of Gunnar, of\r\nLithend, the dame whose virulence is the cause of all the vengeance and\r\ncounter-vengeance of the story.\r\n\r\n    Hallbiorg, stone protection.\r\n    Halldis, stone spirit.\r\n    Hallfrid, stone fair.\r\n    Hallgerd, stone fence.\r\n    Hallgeir, stone spear.\r\n    Hallgrim, }stone helmet.\r\n    Hallgrima,}\r\n    Hallkell, }stone kettle.\r\n    Halkatla, }\r\n    Hallmund, stone protection.\r\n    Hallthor, }\r\n    Haldor, }stone of Thor.\r\n    Haldora, }\r\n    Hallvard, }stone guard.\r\n    Halvor, }\r\n\r\n_Grjot_, in German _gries_, is another word for a stone. It was not so\r\ncommon as the others; but there was both a masculine and feminine\r\nGrjotgard, who in Denmark were rendered, the one into Gregorius, the\r\nother into Margarethe. The English lady, Græsia de Bruere (_temp._ Henry\r\nIII.), must have been named from _gries_, a stone.\r\n\r\nSo too was Gries-hilda—Stone battle maid. Griselda was the perfectly\r\npatient wife whose tale was told by Boccaccio, and narrated by Petrarch\r\nto Chaucer, who told it in his own way. The Scots seem to have been\r\npeculiarly delighted with the lady Griselidis—and Grizell or Grisell\r\nacquired fresh honour with Lady Grisell Baillie. Grizzie or Girzie are\r\nthe contractions, and there is a Grisley in the register of Madran,\r\nCornwall, dated 1662.\r\n\r\nThough in general Borg, or Bjorg, is used to mean protection, yet\r\nBergstein is most probably a mountain stone, and it curiously answers to\r\ntwo names of noted ecclesiastics from Somersetshire, whose first\r\nsyllable Dun is a hill; the same with our present word _down_, and the\r\n_dunes_ on the other side of the Channel, where Dunkirk answers to our\r\nDunchurch. The word is probably the Keltic _don_, dark brown, grey, or\r\ndun, used as the epithet of a hill, and lasting on like other Keltic\r\nlocal titles in the _dunum_ of the Romans and the _dun_ of the Teutons.\r\n\r\nThe two Somerset Duns are the hill-wolf, Dunulf, who is said by one of\r\nthe traditions that ought to be true, to have been the swineherd whose\r\ncakes King Alfred burnt, and to have been afterwards made by him bishop\r\nof Winchester, which a Dunulf certainly was. The other was Dunstan, the\r\nmighty ascetic Abbot of Glastonbury and Archbishop of Canterbury, whose\r\ncareer, between wisdom and devotion, frenzy and sternness, is one of the\r\nleast explicable studies of history.\r\n\r\nHis place in the calendar has given this rugged mountain stone a few\r\nnamesakes.\r\n\r\nThere is a race of names, chiefly German, beginning with _hun_, that it\r\nwould seem natural to ascribe to the Huns of Attila; but the original\r\nterm for this race seems to have been in their own language Hiognu, and\r\nwas retained in the pronunciation by other nations before writing and\r\nLatin had made the word Hun. In old Germanic poems, the Huns figure as\r\ngiants or Titans, so that some translate, _huni_, or _hiune_, as a\r\ngiant. The word _hun_, however, also means a stake, and it is most\r\naccording to the ordinary analogy of nomenclature to suppose the names\r\nthus commencing were used in the sense of a stake, meaning either the\r\nweapon or that the bearer was strong and straight as a stake or a\r\nsupport, like the staff in Gustav.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Humfrey        │Onfroi         │Onufrio        │Humfrid        │\r\n   │Humphrey       │               │Onofredo       │               │\r\n   │Humps          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Numps          │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe names of this commencement are Huno, Hunnerich, latterly lost in\r\nHeinrich, Hunold, the French Hunaud, Hunibert, which was corrupted in\r\nFrance into Humbert, and belonged to various counts of Savoy and\r\ndauphins of Auvergne, Hunigar, in Hungeir and Hunifred, which the French\r\nmuch affected in the form of Onfroi, which belonged to one of the\r\nshort-lived kings of Jerusalem, and was Latinized as Onuphrius. In the\r\nform of Humfrey it was much used by the great house of Bohun; and\r\nthrough his mother, their heiress, descended to the ill-fated son of\r\nHenry IV., who has left it an open question whether dining with Duke\r\nHumfrey alludes to the report that he was starved to death, or to the\r\nElizabethan habit for poor gentility to beguile the dinner-hour by a\r\npromenade near the tomb of Duke Humfrey Stafford in old St. Paul’s. From\r\nbeing a noble and knightly name, Humphrey, as we barbarously spell it,\r\ncame to be a peasant’s appellation, and now is almost disused.\r\n\r\nThe northern Hundolf, or Hunnolf, and Hungerdur, are in some doubt\r\nbetween the dog and the stake.\r\n\r\nThe helmet is the most popular piece of armour in Germany. It comes from\r\nthe word meaning to cover, the very same that furnished _hol_, whole,\r\nhale, and holy. To _heal_ a wound is to cover it, and health is\r\nsoundness. The Teutonic languages teem with derivatives from _hulyan_\r\nand _helan_, of which all that shall be here mentioned are our own;\r\nheel, the covered part of the foot, the hold of a ship, its hull, and\r\nthe provincial hulls (chaff), and hillier (a slater).\r\n\r\nThe Latin _galea_ was nearly related to the _helm_ of the German, and\r\nmay be from the same source. Indeed, it is, as has been said before,\r\ndoubtful whether Galeazzo Visconti was the offspring of a classical or\r\nof a Gothic helmet. The only popular northern helmet is Hjalmar, the\r\nhelmed warrior, apparently in honour of one of the heroes of the Orvarod\r\nSaga; but Germany has Helmar, Helmerich, in Friesland Elmark, the helmed\r\nking, Helmund, or helmet protection, Helmbold, Helmut, Helmich, Helmtac;\r\nbesides numerous _helms_ at the end of words, of which Wilhelm is the\r\nmost notable.\r\n\r\nThe sword figures in northern and German nomenclature as Brand; but not\r\nfrom the verb _to burn_, but from _brandr_, an elastic staff,\r\ntransferred to the blade of a sword. It would also mean the staff of a\r\nbow, and a short straight stripe of colour, whence a cow so marked is\r\n_brandet_ in the north, branded with us. The Brands are many, with\r\nGerman and Frank commencements, such as Hildeprant, Liutprant, &c., but\r\nseldom common; though Brand sometimes stands alone in the North, and\r\nBrandolf, or sword wolf, is an old name. Perhaps the Zetland Brenda may\r\nbe the feminine.\r\n\r\nDegen, a blade, is another sword name of rarer use, and exclusively\r\nGerman. It also is compounded into Degenhard, then contracted into\r\nDeinhard; but the primary meaning is the hero, as it comes from the same\r\nword as _tugend_, virtue or valour.\r\n\r\nAnother very old term for a sword was _hjøru_, or _hiru_, in the North;\r\n_hairu_, _heru_, in the Gothic; _heoru_, in Anglo-Saxon. Here we see\r\nthat the Heruli and Cheruschi, as the Romans called them, were both\r\nsword men. Heoruvard, or Hereward the Saxon, was the sword guardian;\r\nHeorugar answered to the northern Hjørgeir; there was a Gothic\r\nHairuwolf, or Heruwolf; in the North, Hiørulf, Hiørleif, and Hiørdis\r\nalso occur; but the syllable gets contracted into Her, and the names are\r\nnot easily distinguished from those beginning with _her_, a warrior.\r\nHjaraande is another northern form.\r\n\r\nBoge, the bow, is sparsely found alone, and as Bauggisel in Iceland, and\r\nnow and then in Norway at the end of a name. Bogo was Old German, and\r\nthe surnames in Denmark Bugge, in England Bogue. But its English fame\r\nrests upon a champion called Bogo, who was supposed by our ancestors to\r\nhave been Earl of Southampton at the time of the Norman Conquest; to\r\nhave fought a battle with the invaders at Cardiff, and to have left his\r\nsword as a relic at Arundel Castle. Whether this ever occurred or not,\r\nBoge was rendered by Norman tongues into Bevis, or Beavois, and was the\r\nsubject of an old metrical romance, where his great exploit is killing\r\nthe tremendous giant Ascapart, who had carried off his wife, the\r\nconverted Saracen princess Josyan. He lives to a good old age, sees his\r\ntwin sons kings, and dies happily on the same day as his wife and his\r\ngood horse Arundel, once doubtless Hirondelle, or the swallow.\r\n\r\nHis fame travelled to Italy, where Buovo d'Antona is accepted as one of\r\nthe heroes of romance, though he stands alone, not fitting into any of\r\nthe cycles. The etymologists of Elizabeth’s time were led by the form\r\nBeavois, in which they spelt the word, to imagine that it was\r\nBellovisus, beautiful to behold. But if ‘Bevis of Hampton’ was anybody,\r\nhe was an Anglo-Danish ‘Bow,’ or Boge, a word which, like bay, bough,\r\nand boughsome or buxom, comes from _bygan_, to bend.\r\n\r\nThe spear and the breastplate, Geir and Brune, will be mentioned in the\r\nnext chapter. The shield is now and then found in the North, as Skialde,\r\nSkioldbjorn, Skiolulf, and Skioldvar, shield bear, wolf, and, more\r\nappropriately, shield caution. The shield wolf is capable of being\r\ncontracted into Schelluf.\r\n\r\n_Saro_, _saru_, _searu_, is the entire equipment or suit of armour;\r\nSørle is a Norwegian name for it, contracted into Solle; and among the\r\nNormans was called Serlo, and considered to be the same with Saher.\r\n\r\nIf there were plenty of weapons, there was also balsam to heal their\r\nwounds; that is, if the northern names beginning with _Sölv_ are rightly\r\nreferred to salve, the same word in the North as with us. The _v_ has\r\nfor the most part been left out by pronunciation, but the dotted _o_\r\nremains to testify that Sölmund, or Saamund, has no connection with Sol,\r\nthe sun, as little as with Solomon, by which the Danish bishops rendered\r\nit. Solveig, healing drink, is now Solva, and Sölvar is Sölvi.[128]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  Grimm; Munch; Dasent; _Int. to Nial Saga_; Weber and Jamieson; Spanish\r\n  Heraldry (_Quarterly Review_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Michaelis; Ellis; Campbell; Montalembert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION XII.—_Thought._\r\n\r\nMind or thought amounts to a mythical character in northern fancy. The\r\nword is _hugr_, the same with _hu_, still the Scandinavian word for\r\nthought, as _heuge_ is in Holland, all coming from old verbs represented\r\nby the Mæso-Gothic _gahugan_, and Anglo-Saxon _gehygan_.\r\n\r\nThe two ravens who sat on Odin’s shoulders, and revealed to him all that\r\npassed in the world, were Huginn and Munninn, thought and memory; and\r\nwhen Thor made his famous visit to Utgard, it was Hugi, or thought,\r\nalone that was swift enough to outstrip him in the race. At Tours, the\r\nNorthern Lights are _le carrosse du roi Hugues_, perhaps originally from\r\nsome connection with speed of thought, though latterly mixed up with\r\nHugues Capet.\r\n\r\nThe name has been much used by all the Teutons, and it was not\r\ninappropriately chosen by Fouqué, as that of the old knight in the\r\n_Magic ring_, whose character he has sacrificed for the sake of making\r\nhim the representative parent of all the chivalry of Europe, except the\r\nEnglish, which he considers as independently typified by Richard Cœur de\r\nLion. This roving knight appears at home as Hugo; Hugur in the North;\r\nHugues, in France; Uguccione, in Italy; and even as Hygies, in Greece,\r\nwhich last is, however, only a resemblance, not a translation.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │   Scottish.   │    Gaelic.    │    French.    │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │Hugh           │Hugh           │Uisdean.       │Hugues         │\r\n   │Hugo           │Hughie         │               │Hues           │\r\n   │Hutchin        │Hutcheon       │               │Huon           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Huet           │\r\n   │               │               │               │Hugolin        │\r\n   │               │               │               │Huguenin       │\r\n   │               │               │               │Ugues          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │    German.    │  Norwegian.   │\r\n   │Oc             │Ugo            │Hugo           │Hugr           │\r\n   │               │Ugolino        │               │Hugi           │\r\n   │               │Ugone          │               │               │\r\n   │               │Ugotto         │               │               │\r\n   │               │Uguccione      │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nPart of the popularity of the name was, no doubt, owing to the Cymric\r\ncountries having adopted it as the nearest resemblance to the mighty Hu\r\nGadarn, from whom the national Hugh of Wales almost certainly sprung. A\r\nFrank saint, Archbishop of Rouen, and one of the many canonized cousins\r\nof Pepin, first made Hugo current among his own race; but the only\r\nperson who wore it on the throne was the Gallican Count of Paris, who\r\nmay have had it as a compromise between the Cymric Hu and Frank Hugr; at\r\nany rate, it was long spelt without the _g_ in France, and declined as\r\nHues, Huon. The old Cambrai form was Huet, with the feminine Huette.\r\n\r\nHugo is very frequent in Domesday Book, and the name was much more\r\ncommon in earlier times than at present. In Scotland and Ireland it has\r\nbeen pressed into the service of Anglicizing the native Aodh, or fire;\r\nbut the Gaelic name Uisdean, pronounced something like ocean, is most\r\nlikely intended as a rendering of Hutcheon, the form in which the Scots\r\ncaught the Hugon of their Anglo-Norman neighbours, who revered the name\r\ndoubly for the sake of the good bishop of Lincoln, and for another St.\r\nHugh of Lincoln, _i.e._ the child murdered by the Jews, as in the\r\n_Prioress’s Tale_ in Chaucer. St. Hugh of Lincoln is revered in the\r\nnorth of Italy as well as at home; and Ugo is common there in all manner\r\nof varieties, the most memorable, perhaps, being that of the terrible\r\nGenoese, Ugolino de Gherardesca, whose fearful fate has been rendered\r\nfamous by Dante. In Dutch, it is Huig. Huig Groot was the home name of\r\nthe author whom the world hailed as Hugo Grotius, and the Walloons use\r\nthe contraction Hosch.\r\n\r\nHyge was the Low German form, and Hygelac is the sea-king of the Geats,\r\nthe friend and lord in the poem of _Beowulf_. The latter syllable _lac_\r\nis the northern _leik_, and Gothic _laiks_, signifying both reward and\r\nsport, the same word that in some parts of England has become _lake_,\r\nmeaning to play or to be idle, and in slang, to _lark_. It is rather a\r\nfavourite termination, but only a commencement in the Norse feminine\r\nLeikny, fresh sport.\r\n\r\nHygelac is thus the sport of thought, or it may be, the reward of\r\nthought. Hugoleik was thus not an inappropriate name for an old Frank\r\nchronicler, who has had the misfortune to descend to the world by the\r\nhorrible Latinism of Chochilaicus. Hugleik was current in Norway, was\r\ntransformed by the Danes into Hauleik and Hovleik, and in Ireland seems\r\nto have turned into Ulic, a favourite name, but latterly transmogrified\r\ninto Ulysses.\r\n\r\nHugibert, or bright mind, belonged to the bishop of Liege, to whom\r\nattached the Teutonic story of the hunter’s conversion by the\r\ncross-bearing stag, making him the patron of hunters, and his name very\r\npopular in France, Flanders, northern Italy, and probably once in\r\nEngland, since it has left us the two surnames of Hubbard and Hobart.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │Portuguese. │  German.   │\r\n   │Hubert      │Hubert      │Uberto      │Huberto     │Hucpraht    │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │Hugibert    │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │Hubert      │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nIt used to be wrongly translated bright of hue.\r\n\r\nHugibald became the German Hugbold and the Italian Ubaldo, the prince of\r\nthought; Hugihard, or firm in mind, is the French Huard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                     HEROIC NAMES OF THE NIBELUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION I.—_The Nibelung._\r\n\r\nAs the Greeks believed in the exploits of semi-divine heroes, a sort of\r\nborderers between Olympus and the human race, so the Teutonic race had\r\nits grand universal legends of beings rising above human nature, and\r\noften embodying beliefs that once had attached to the gods themselves.\r\n\r\nThe great Teutonic legend, holding the same place as the deeds of\r\nHercules, Theseus, and the Argonauts did in Greece, or those of Fionn\r\nwith the Gael, is the story of the _Nibelung_. How old it may be is past\r\ncomputation, but it was apparently common to the whole Gothic race,\r\nsince names connected with it come from Spain, Lombardy, and France:\r\nfragments of the story are traceable in England and the Faroe Islands,\r\nand the whole is told at length in Germany, Norway, and Denmark. Each of\r\nthese three latter countries claim vehemently to have originated the\r\nromance, but there is little doubt that it was one of the original\r\nimaginations of the entire race, and that each division moulded the\r\nframework their own way, though with a general likeness.\r\n\r\nNames of historical personages, probably called from its heroes, have\r\nled many to suppose it exaggerated history; but each attempt to fit it\r\non to a real person has resulted in confusion, and led to the perception\r\nthat the actors are really mythical, and the localities, which chiefly\r\nlie in Burgundian Germany, were only connected with it by that general\r\nlaw which always finds a home for every heroic adventure.\r\n\r\nThe tale is begun by the Norwegian Volsunga Saga, and, about half way\r\nthrough, it is taken up by the Danish Vilkina and Niflung Saga, and by\r\nthe German Nibelungenlied, and it is finished by numerous Danish ballads\r\nand German tales, songs, and poems, with the sort of inconsistencies\r\nalways to be found in popular versions of ancient myths, but with the\r\nsame main incidents.\r\n\r\nNifelheim, the supposed abode of these heroes, is interpreted to be\r\n_nebelwelt_, the world of mist, or cloudland, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that the heroes said to be descended from the mythic Vili, Vidga,\r\nand Velint, are, in fact, fallen deities. Germany, however, turned\r\nNifelheim into the Netherlands, and placed the realm of Brynhild in\r\nIceland, and the scene of Aldrian’s and Gunter’s court at Wurms, the\r\ncentre of the Burgundians.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the story is another form of the original\r\nmyth, with the same idea, carried through, of the early death of the\r\nglorious victor, and of the revenge for his death, but only through a\r\nuniversal slaughter in which all perish. But the whole has become\r\nhumanized, and the actors are men and not deities; and thus the allegory\r\nis far less traceable.\r\n\r\nThe story, as it begins in the Volsunga Saga, relates that there were\r\nthree brothers, Fafner, Reginn, and Audvar, or Ottur, whose name is from\r\nthe same source as _øg_, awe, so that he may be another form of Œgir.\r\nTransforming himself into the beast that bears his name, for the\r\nconvenience of catching himself a fish dinner, Ottur was killed, in this\r\nshape, by Loki. The father and the other brothers insisted that, by way\r\nof compensation, in the Teutonic fashion, Loki should fill the dead\r\notter’s skin with treasure, which he accomplished, but laid the treasure\r\nunder the curse, that it should do no good to its owner. Accordingly,\r\nthe amount excited the avarice of Fafner, and after murdering his\r\nfather, he transformed himself into a dragon, and kept watch over the\r\ntreasure, to prevent Reginn from obtaining it.[129]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  Lettsom, _Niebelung_; Weber and Jamieson; Koepper; Howitt, _Northern\r\n  Romance_; Grimm, _Deutsche Heldensagen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Sigurd._\r\n\r\n_Sig_, or _siga_, means, in all Teutonic tongues, conquest; and the\r\nVictor seems to have been a very old epithet for the Divinity. St.\r\nAugustin speaks of a Gothic exclamation _Sihora armen_, which he\r\ntranslates as Κύριε ἐλεήσον, and the first word of which evidently\r\nanswers to Ceadmon’s epithets for the Almighty, _Sigorafrea_,\r\n_Sigorugod_, _Sigoracyning_.\r\n\r\nOdin was called Sigfadir, or conquering father, and this accounts for\r\nthe later notion that the adventurer was called Sigge, and assumed the\r\ndivine appellation of Odin.\r\n\r\nThence the victorious god, conquering the serpent, yet afterwards dying,\r\nwhether he were originally meant for Odin himself, or for another form\r\nof Baldur, sank into a human serpent-slayer, bearing the name of\r\nvictory—Sigward, perhaps originally, but varied into Sigufrit,\r\nSiegfried, and Sigurd.\r\n\r\nThe main points in Siegfried’s story are that he was the son of Siegmund\r\nthe Volsung, and of Queen Sigelind; born, according to the _Book of\r\nHeroes_, under the same circumstances as Perdita, in the _Winter’s\r\nTale_; put, by way of cradle, into a drinking-glass, and accidentally\r\nthrown into the river, where he was picked up by the smith Mimir, and\r\neducated by him. In the _Book of Heroes_ he is so strong that he caught\r\nthe lions in the woods and hung them over his castle wall by their\r\ntails. Reginn incited him to fight with and slay the dragon, Fafner, and\r\nobtain the treasure, including the tarn-cap of invisibility. Also, on\r\nroasting and eating the heart of Fafner, he became able to understand\r\nthe language of the birds. And by a bath in the blood he was made\r\ninvulnerable, except where a leaf had unfortunately adhered to his skin,\r\nbetween his shoulders, and given him, like Achilles and Diarmaid, a\r\nmortal spot. His first discovery from the song of a bird was that Reginn\r\nmeant to murder him at once; he therefore forestalled his intentions,\r\nand took possession of the fatal gift, thus incurring the curse. The\r\n_Book of Heroes_ calls him Siegfried the horny, and introduces him at\r\nthe court of the German favourite, Theodoric, and the _Nibelungenlied_\r\nseparates the dragon from the treasure, and omits most of the marvellous\r\nin the obtaining it.\r\n\r\nHis next exploit was the rescue and awakening of Brynhild; but he fell\r\ninto a magic state of oblivion as to all that had passed with her, when\r\nhe presented himself at the court of Wurms, and became the husband of\r\nGudrun, or Chriemhild, as a recompense for having, by means of his\r\ntarn-cap, enabled Gunnar to overcome the resistance of Brynhilda\r\nherself, and obliged her to become his submissive bride. Revelations\r\nmade by the two ladies, when in a passion, led to vengeance being\r\ntreacherously wreaked upon Siegfried, who was pierced in his vulnerable\r\nspot while he was lying down on his face to drink from a fountain during\r\na hunting party in the forest. The remainder of the history is the\r\nvengeance taken for his death; and the North further holds that his\r\nchild, Aslaug, was left the sole survivor of the race, and finally\r\nmarried Ragner Lodbrog, whence her descendants always trace their\r\npedigree from Sigurdr Fafner’s bane.\r\n\r\nHis namesakes are well-nigh innumerable. There are nineteen in the\r\n_Landnama-bok_; and Sigurdr swarms in the earlier Scandinavian royal\r\nlines, being, perhaps, most remarkable in the person of King Sigurd the\r\nCrusader of Norway.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │\r\n   │Sigefrid       │Sigefroi       │Sigefrid       │Sigl           │\r\n   │Siward         │Siffroi        │Siegfried      │   —————————   │\r\n   │Seaward        │   —————————   │Sigfrid        │  Norwegian.   │\r\n   │Seaforth       │   Italian.    │Seifrid        │Sigvard        │\r\n   │Seyferth       │Sigefredo      │Sikko          │Sigurdhr       │\r\n   │               │Siffredo       │Sicco          │Siurd          │\r\n   │               │               │Sigo           │Sjul           │\r\n   │               │               │   —————————   │Syvert         │\r\n   │               │               │    Polish.    │Syver          │\r\n   │               │               │Sygfryd        │Siewers        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nAt the instance of the king of Sweden, our Edred had sent a missionary\r\nnamed Sigefried, who is esteemed the apostle of Sweden, and gave a\r\nChristian sanction to the serpent-slayer’s name, whence it has continued\r\nextremely common there. The stout old Danish Earl Siward, the conqueror\r\nof Macbeth, the same who had the bear’s ears and would only die upon his\r\nfeet, is an English version of the northern Sigurdr, and bore the name\r\nthat is now Seaward. Indeed Sæward is found among the kings of Essex in\r\n616, and, in fact, that line have so many prefixes of _Sige_, that it is\r\nlikely that they thought themselves connected with Fafner’s bane. There\r\nis a Sigefugel, or Sigewolf, in their descent from Odin, who may be\r\nanother form of Sigurd. Germany has made the feminine Sigfrida.\r\n\r\nSome have considered the story to be chiefly Burgundian; and Sigmund,\r\nconquering protection, the name of Sigurdr’s father, was that of the\r\nfirst Catholic king of Burgundy, who was canonized both for the recovery\r\nof his kingdom from Arianism, and for the severity of his penance, after\r\nhaving killed his son, Sigeric, on a false stepdame’s calumny. His\r\nrelics were carried to Prague in the fourteenth century, and the effect\r\nof the translation appeared at once in the name of the Bohemian-born\r\nEmperor Sigismund, from whom this became European, and formed the\r\nfeminine Sigismunda. Gismonda is thus an old Lombardic feminine.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Sigismund      │Sigismond      │Sigismondo     │Sigmund        │\r\n   │Sæmund         │   —————————   │Sismondo       │Sigismund      │\r\n   │               │Portuguese.    │               │               │\r\n   │               │Sigismundo     │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Norwegian.   │    Polish.    │   Illyrian.   │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Sigmund        │Zygmunt        │Sisman         │Zsigmond       │\r\n   │Sæmund         │   ————————    │               │Zsiga          │\r\n   │               │   Bohemian.   │               │               │\r\n   │               │Zikmund        │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nSome have imagined that the curious correspondence of names, when\r\nSigebert, the Frank, married Brynhild, the Goth, is a sign that the\r\n_Nibelung_ referred to the Austrasian court; but the Frank Sigebert\r\nwould have been a very poor serpent-slayer, and, no doubt, only bore the\r\nname as a remembrance of him, as did our East Saxon monarch Sæbert, and\r\nthe Spanish bishop Siseberto. It has lasted on in Germany and Friesland,\r\nto be called Sizo, Sitto, Sibert, and Sidde, and is the English surname\r\nSebright.

This is the\r\nnorthern version, the evident origin of our fairy tale of the _Sleeping\r\nBeauty_, pricked not by the thorn of Odin, but by the distaff, perhaps,\r\nof one of the Nornir. The _Book of Heroes_ reduces the circle of flame\r\nto a mere strong castle, with seven gates; and the _Nibelungenlied_ only\r\ntakes up the story at the time of Sigfried’s appearance at the court of\r\nBurgundy, and courtship of Brynhild’s rival, Chriemhild.\r\n\r\nBrynhild had retained her matchless strength, and, like the Greek\r\nAtalanta, was only to be won by a champion who could excel her in games\r\nof strength, and her conquered suitors were all put to death. Gunther,\r\nthe brother of Chriemhild, being willing to obtain her on these\r\nconditions, Siegfried, by means of his tarn-cap, invisibly vanquished\r\nthe Valkyr, while Gunther appeared to be her conqueror; and when she\r\nthus had been compelled to give her hand, it was Siegfried who, again\r\nunseen, broke down her violent resistance, and compelled her to become a\r\nsubmissive wife, on which she lost all her supernatural strength.\r\nSiegfried was rewarded by the hand of Chriemhild, Gunther’s sister.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the two sisters-in-law had a desperate quarrel about\r\nprecedence; in the old northern version, which should wade farthest into\r\nthe Rhine when bathing; in the half-civilized German song, which should\r\nfirst enter the cathedral of Wurms; and in the course of it Brynhild was\r\nroundly informed that she had not given way to her husband, but to\r\nSiegfried. Valkyr nature could not stand such an affront, so Brynhild\r\nset on Hagen to assassinate Siegfried. The northern story makes her slay\r\nherself, and be burnt with his corpse on a funeral pile, in Suttee\r\nfashion; the German tames her into being merely brought to repentance\r\ntoo late by the death of her husband.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Brynhild was commemorated by the name of the Gothic princess,\r\ndaughter of King Athanagild, who, for her misfortune, was married to the\r\nFrank Sigebert, and through the whole of her long life continued a\r\nfierce and dauntless resistance to her savage rival Fredegund, until,\r\nwhen both were aged women, Brenhilda fell into her rival’s power, and\r\nwas implacably sentenced to be dragged to death by wild horses. French\r\nhistorians aver that her name was at first only Bruna, and that hilda\r\nwas added to make it royal; but this is very unlikely, since Spanish\r\nhistorians call her Brenhilda. The Latinism is Brunechildis, in French\r\nBrunehault, but the name has not been followed, except by the northern\r\nrace, whose existence was hardly developed at the time of the\r\nmisfortunes of the Austrasian queen, and who therefore take it from her\r\noriginal. Among these it has been contracted to Brunilla and Brynil.\r\n\r\nThe meaning is the Valkyr of the Breastplate, the _byrni_ of old\r\nScottish, _bryne_ of the North, _bruniga_ of the German, _broigne_ in\r\nOld French, _bronha_ in Provençal. A near connection of this name is the\r\nnorthern Bryngerd, placing the gentle Gerda in this cuirass; and the\r\nNorth has likewise Brynjar, properly _hari_, the Cuirassier, and\r\nBrynjolfr, which wolf in a breastplate was a great Icelandic ancestor,\r\nand has been cut short into Brynjuv and Brynjo.\r\n\r\nThe Chriemhild, or Helmet Valkyr of the _Nibelung_, is the Gudrun of the\r\nnorthern version; and Gudrun, as before said, would be either good\r\nwisdom, or, far more probably, war wisdom. In the _Nibelungenlied_, the\r\naction of the story begins with Chriemhild telling her mother her dream\r\nof her favourite falcon being torn to pieces by two eagles; and when it\r\nis explained to mean her future husband, vowing that she will never\r\nmarry. However, Siegfried’s arrival, and his successful exertions in\r\nwinning Brunhild for Gunther, overcame all the lady’s scruples.\r\n\r\nShe had lived happily ten years in the Netherlands with Siegfried\r\nbefore, on a visit to Wurms, she was so ill-advised as to reproach\r\nBrynhild with his victory over her; and afterwards was deluded into\r\nsewing a mark upon his garments to show where was his vulnerable spot.\r\nAfter his death, she found out the murderer by the ordeal of touch, and\r\ntreasured up a deadly and enduring spirit of revenge; perhaps the most\r\nterrible of all the many forms in which legend has proclaimed the old\r\nrule of blood for blood.\r\n\r\nShe was left the heiress of all Siegfried’s treasure, as well as of his\r\n_Nibelungen_ or Netherlandian troops, but it was taken from her by her\r\nhusband’s murderer, and sunk beneath the Rhine. After thirteen years of\r\nwidowhood, she was induced to marry Etzel, or Atli, king of the Huns, by\r\nthe promise that he would avenge all her injuries; but still she bided\r\nher time for thirteen more years, at the end of which space she invited\r\nher brothers and all their champions to visit her in Hungary at\r\nEtzelenburg. They had not long been there before she stirred up a most\r\ntremendous battle, in which mutual destruction took place, as is\r\nminutely related in the ancient lays. Finally her brother Gunther was\r\ncaptured and slain at her savage command, and she herself slew the\r\nmurderer Hagen with Siegfried’s own sword. Immediately after, however,\r\nshe was put to death as an act of justice by old Sir Hildebrand; at\r\nleast so says the _Nibelungenlied_; but in the _Kœmpe Viser_ there is a\r\nstill further revenge, for the secret of the deposit of the treasure is\r\nleft with the son of Hagen, who beguiles Grimhild into the cave with the\r\nhope of its restoration, and there locks her in and starves her to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe historical Attila is really said to have had a German wife named\r\nKremheilch. The Gudrun of the North is a far more amiable personage. She\r\nforgives her brother, and is with difficulty persuaded to marry Atli,\r\nwho is, in this version, Brynhild’s brother, and lays the plot against\r\nGunther, in order to avenge his sister’s death. She does all in her\r\npower to warn them, but in vain; and when all had been slain, her senses\r\nfailed her, and in her frenzy she slew her two children by Atli, and\r\nmade him drink their blood; he died of horror, and she cast herself into\r\nthe sea, but was carried alive to the land of King Jonakr, whom she\r\nmarried, and then underwent other misfortunes which extinguished the\r\nlast remains of her family. Her name of Gudrun has already been treated\r\nof.[131]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  _Nibelungenlied_; Weber and Jamieson; Thierry; Mariana; Munch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IV.—_Gunther._\r\n\r\n_Gunth_ (Goth.), _guth_ (A.G.S.), _gunnr_ (North), _gond_ or _gonz_\r\n(High German), all meant war or battle, and have an immense number of\r\nderivative names, inextricably mixed up with those from God and Gut; and\r\nit is even thought that there may be a close connection between them, so\r\nmuch did the Teutons believe their deities to be gods of battle, and\r\ngoodness to be courage. The word _gunth_ has lived on even in Lombardy\r\nin the Gonfalon, the war banner, solemnly carried out to battle in a car\r\nas the images of the gods had formerly been, in charge of the official\r\nknown as the _gonfaloniere_ in the republics of northern Italy.\r\nGundahari, warrior, was really an old name among the kings of Burgundy,\r\nwho were, no doubt, called in honour of Gunther or Gunnar, the eldest\r\nbrother of Kriemhild, and husband of Brynhild. He seems to have been\r\nbrave but weak, led first by Sigurd, then by Hagen, but at last fighting\r\nwith great spirit.\r\n\r\nGunthar, or Gunnar, at full length Gundahari, continued in favour with\r\nthe Burgundians; and an abbot in Brittany being canonized, left Gonthier\r\nto France, and Gontiere to Italy.\r\n\r\nThis masculine Gunnar was very common in the North, and so was likewise\r\nthe feminine Gunnr, war, or Gundvar, war prudence, both confounded in\r\nGunnar, which historians generally render as Gunnora.\r\n\r\nGunnhildur was in high favour in the North. One most celebrated owner\r\nwas the wicked queen of Eric Blodaxe. She was said to be a native of the\r\nOrkneys, and to have filled Scandinavia with her crimes, upon the\r\ndetails of which, however, Norse and Danish histories are not quite\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nGunhild again was the Danish princess whose murder on St. Brice’s night\r\nbrought her brother Sweyn down in fury upon England; and her nephew Knud\r\nlikewise had a daughter so called, but who was Anglicized into\r\nÆthelthryth; and each generation of the Godwine family records a lady\r\nGunhild. After the Conquest, however, Gunhild died away in England; but\r\nit has never been discarded in the North, where it is now called\r\nGunnilda, or Gunula.\r\n\r\nThat daughter of William the Conqueror, or sister of Gherbod the\r\nFleming, whichever she was, who was the ancestress of the Warrennes, and\r\nis buried at Lewes, has a name so much disguised as to be as doubtful as\r\nher birth. It maybe Gunatrud, a Valkyr title, or Gundridur, war haste,\r\nor Gundrada, war council, the same as the Spanish Gontrado; at any rate\r\nit has had few followers.\r\n\r\nGunnr and Göndol were both Valkyr titles, and the Valkyr Göndol’s most\r\nnoted namesake was a maiden of the Karling race, who was bred up by St.\r\nGertrude, at Nivelle; and on her return to her father’s castle at\r\nMorzelle, used to go to her early devotions at a church half a league\r\ndistant from home. On winter mornings she was lighted by a lantern,\r\nwhich the legend avers to have been blown out by the wind, but rekindled\r\nby her prayers. Thence comes the name of St. Gundula’s lamp, applied to\r\nthe _Tremella_, an orange-coloured jelly-like fungus that grows on dead\r\nbranches of trees in the winter. She is the patroness of Brussels, where\r\nthe church of St. Gudule is the place used for coronations; but her\r\ncommon title in Flanders is Ste. Goëlan, while the convent built in her\r\nhonour at Morzelle, in Brabant, is Ste. Goule.\r\n\r\nWar could not fail to have her wolf, the Gundulf of Norman England, the\r\nGunnolfr of Iceland, the Gundolf of Germany, and, far more notable than\r\neither, the Gonsalvo or Gonzalo of Spain, always frequent among the\r\nVisigothic families, and becoming especially glorious in the person of\r\nthe great captain, the brave and honourable conqueror of Naples, and the\r\ntrainer of the infantry that gave the predominance to Spain for a\r\nhundred years, until they fell as one man at Rocroy.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  French.   │ Provençal. │  Spanish.  │Portuguese. │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Gonsalve    │Guossalvo   │Gonzalo     │Gonçalo     │Consalvo    │\r\n   │Gonzalve    │            │            │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe war raven, Gunthram, figures in French history as Gontran, and the\r\nwar serpent is the German Gundlin, or Gondoline, when a lady; when a\r\nman, the terrible Guthorm, whom, as King Alfred’s foe, godson, and\r\ntributary, our histories call Guthrum. In Denmark, the name was very\r\nearly contracted into Gorm; but it has been so often spelt Gudthorm,\r\nthat a doubt has arisen whether the latter half of the word may not be\r\n_thorm_ or _thyrma_.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to distinguish between the derivatives of _God_ and\r\n_Gund_, both being very apt to eliminate the distinctive letters. On the\r\nwhole, however, it seems as if these warlike names had been some of the\r\nmost universal throughout the continent, though in England they were\r\nvery scarce, and do not occur in royal pedigree, nor in hagiology,\r\nexcept in the case of St. Guthlac, the first founder of the original\r\nCroyland Abbey, whose name in the North would be Gudleik or Gulleik, war\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nHosts of northern Frankish and Visigothic names thus commence, and many\r\nfeminines end with this word.

In the Danish version he is the half-brother of Grimhild\r\nand Gunther, with an elf-father; in the German, he is their wise and\r\nfar-travelled uncle, who first related the adventures of the\r\nnewly-arrived stranger, Siegfried, but always seems to have disliked\r\nhim, and readily undertook to revenge Brynhild’s injuries upon him. As\r\nLoki deceived Frigga, he persuaded his niece to mark where was the\r\nmortal spot on her husband’s skin, and contrived that no wine should be\r\ntaken into the forest, so that Siegfried might be reduced to lie down to\r\ndrink at the stream, and thus expose the fatal place.\r\n\r\nThe body bled at his touch, and he was the chief object of Chriemhilt’s\r\nvengeance, more especially after he had taken the treasure away from\r\nher, placed it in a cave beneath the Rhine, and jealously guarded the\r\nsecret of the spot. When she invited the brothers to Hungary he was much\r\naverse to the journey, till he found that his disclination was imputed\r\nto fear, when he became vehemently set upon going, in spite of the omens\r\nagainst it. Taunts and injuries passed between him and Chriemhilt, and\r\nthe next day the fierce and furious battle began, which raged till\r\nGunther and Haghen alone were left. After Gunther had been killed,\r\nChriemhilt offered Haghen his life, on condition that he would disclose\r\nthe place where the treasure was, but he refused, and died by her hand.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious poem, called the _Duke of Aquitaine_, which is\r\nevidently another version of the same notion of Haghen. Hagano, a\r\ndescendant of the Trojans, is there sent to deprecate the invasion of\r\nAttila, and afterwards assists the Burgundian king Gunther of Wurms in\r\nan attack on Duke Walther of Aquitaine, and Hildegunna, sister to\r\nGunther, in order to recover a treasure that they had carried off from\r\nAttila’s court, where they had been hostages. This version of the great\r\ncentral story of Europe named Hagen, Count of Aquitaine, the uncle of\r\nCharles the Bald; but the North has used it more, in the form of Hogen.\r\n\r\nThe name is either from _hagr_, deft or handy, or else from _hagi_, a\r\nhook; most probably the latter, perhaps in connection with the other\r\nmeaning, a thorn or prickle, so that here we may find a personification\r\nof the thorn destroying the victor. The word _hag_ is seldom found in\r\nnames, and is probably imitated from Hagen, without much regard to the\r\nmeaning. It occurs only in the Danish, as Hagbrand, Hagbart, contracted\r\nas Habaar, or Habor; Hagthor, which is incorrectly modernized as Hector;\r\nand Hagny. The more usual form in Denmark is Hogne, probably from the\r\nGerman Hagano.\r\n\r\nBut there has been a confusion between this Hagan, or Hogni, and Haagan,\r\nproperly Haakvin, from _haa_, high, and _kyn_, meaning of high kin, the\r\nwell-known Norwegian and Danish name of many a fierce viking; sometimes\r\nLatinized as Haquinus, Frenchified as Haquin, and called in the North\r\nHaaken, or Hakon. Domesday has it as Kaco, Hacon, Hacun, and Hakena; and\r\nHacon still lingers among the fishermen of the Orkneys. Other northern\r\nnames, with the same opening, _haa_ (pronounced _ho_), are Haamund, no\r\ndoubt the parent of our Hammond, and Haavard, whence our Hayward, both\r\nalike meaning high protection.[133]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Lettsom; _Nibelungenlied_; Weber and Jamieson; Munch; Anderson, _Royal\r\n  and Noble Genealogies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VI.—_Ghiseler._\r\n\r\nGhiseler is one of the brothers of Gunther, an inoffensive personage,\r\nand the only one of the party of whom Chriemhild took any civil notice,\r\nwhen she had decoyed them to her court to their destruction.\r\nNevertheless he did not escape, but died in combat with Wolfhart, of\r\nBern, when the champions of Dietrich could not be withheld from the\r\nfray.\r\n\r\nHis name is tolerably clear—Giselhar, the pledged warrior. The first\r\nsyllable is from _gildan_, _geldan_, _keltan_, to owe, or to pay what\r\nwas due. The terms ran through all the Gothic tongues, and caused the\r\nAnglo-Saxons to call all the offerings due to the gods _gield_ and\r\n_ghëlstar_.\r\n\r\nA pledge of mutual obligation was, in Anglo-Saxon, _gisel_, and is still\r\n_gidsel_ in the North; in the German, _geissel_. Thence, far more\r\nprobably than from the older word _geisli_, a beam, or nimbus, was\r\nderived the Frank Gisel, as a maiden’s name. A daughter of Pepin, so\r\ncalled, was offered to Leo X. of Constantinople; and afterwards the\r\ndaughter of Charles the Simple, who became the pledge of amity between\r\nthe Karlingen and Northmen, by her marriage with Rollo. She was called\r\nby the French Gisèle, by the Normans Gisla, in which same form it has\r\nlived on in Friesland and in Norway. The commencement is not, however, a\r\nvery common one in the North, though Giselher is repeated in Gissur\r\nIsleifson, Bishop of Iceland, in the eleventh century. Gislaug, the\r\npledge drink, is likewise northern, but though _gils_ is an extremely\r\ncommon termination, almost all the names where it is a commencement are\r\nFrankish, or German, and thus probably Giselfrid came to the North as\r\nGisrod.\r\n\r\nGiselhilda, and Giselberge, were German, also Gisalhart, and Giselof;\r\nand Gisalrico is found among the Spanish Goths. Geltfried and Giltimir\r\nare also German forms, and the latter explains Gelimer, the Vandal king\r\nin Africa, conquered by Belisarius.\r\n\r\nGils is a common Norwegian name, and no doubt contributed to the English\r\nGiles, French Gilles, and Spanish Gil, though all these look to the\r\nGreek hermit in France, Aigidios, as their patron. In the North, Ægidius\r\nis rendered by Ilian, Yljan, Yrjan, Orjan, but not by Giles: and it\r\nwould seem as if Julius had been confounded with the name, as well as,\r\nperhaps, Giolla, a servant.\r\n\r\nGiolla Brigde, or Bridget’s disciple, is thought to have contributed the\r\nScottish examples of Gilbert, which is incorrectly explained by some as\r\nGelb-bert, or yellow bright; but is clearly traceable to the old Frank\r\nGiselbert. There were four saints so called, namely, an abbot of\r\nFontenelle, a great friend of William the Conqueror, an Auvergnat knight\r\nin the second Crusade, the English founder of the order of Gilbertine\r\nmonks, and a bishop of Caithness; and it has been a prevalent name in\r\nEngland, Scotland, and the Low Countries, with many contractions,\r\nespecially in the latter.[134]\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Gilbert        │Guilbert       │Gilberto       │Giselbert      │\r\n   │Gilpin         │Gisebert       │   ————————    │Gilbert        │\r\n   │Gil            │Gileber        │Dutch.         │Gisbert        │\r\n   │Gibbon         │Gilbert        │Gysbert        │Gispert        │\r\n   │Gipp           │Ghiliber       │   ————————    │Giseprecht     │\r\n   │               │               │Flemish.       │               │\r\n   │               │               │Gilli          │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Munter; Munch; Michaelis; Grimm; Took.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VII.—_Ghernot._\r\n\r\nGhernot was Gunther’s second brother, who was free from the guilt of the\r\nmurder of Siegfried, and greatly displeased with Haghen for depriving\r\nChriemhilt of the treasure; but he shared the fate of his brothers,\r\nbeing killed early in the encounter by the Markgraf Rudiger.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, necessity of war, or spear compulsion, would be the best\r\nsounding translations of this remarkable name.\r\n\r\nGhere, the same as the northern Gejr and German Kero, is the messenger\r\nsent to invite Siegfried and Chriemhild to Wurms, when they paid the\r\nvisit that had such fatal consequences; and _gher_ or _gjer_ is one of\r\nthe most frequent of the component parts of names. Its right and\r\noriginal meaning is a spear, the same as that of the Latin _quiris_ and\r\nKeltic _coir_. Thence the Anglo-Saxons called all other weapons _waren_,\r\nand the battle _war_, a word we still use, just as the French do\r\n_guerre_, and the Spaniards _guerra_.\r\n\r\n_Gar_ is _quite_ in modern German, and _gher_ has dropped out of the\r\nlanguage, and thus most of the German names commencing with it have been\r\nmisinterpreted to mean _all_, but it is impossible to compare them with\r\ntheir northern cousins without tracing the same spear in both.\r\n\r\nThe chief favourite amongst these spear titles seems to have been once a\r\nValkyr name Gêrdrûd, or Geirthrud, the spear maid; for, alas! the pretty\r\ninterpretation that has caused so many damsels of late to bear it, as\r\nmeaning _all truth_, is utterly untenable, unless they will regard\r\nthemselves as allegorically constant battle-maids, armed with the spear\r\nof Ithuriel.\r\n\r\nThe ancient popularity of this name was owing to a daughter of one of\r\nthe great Pepins, in their _maire du palais_ days. She founded the abbey\r\nof Nivelle, and was intensely revered by the Franks and Germans, chiefly\r\non account of the miracles imputed to her. At old heathen feasts, the\r\ncups quaffed in honour of gods or demi-gods were prefaced by the words\r\n“_Wuotansminne, Thorsminne_,” meaning in Woden’s or Thor’s memory; but\r\nthe Christian teachers changed these toasts to be in the memory of the\r\nsaints, such as Michelsminne for the guardian angel. _Johannisminne_ was\r\nthe special favourite, and was supposed to be a charm against poison,\r\nbecause the Evangelist was thought to have experienced the fulfilment of\r\nthe promise, “If ye drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt you,” as\r\ntypified by the dragon in his cup. The royal nun, Gertrude, was almost\r\nas great a favourite as the Apostle with the Germans, and the regular\r\ntoasts at their banquets came to be _Johannisminne_ and _Gerdrutsminne_,\r\ntill drinking to St. John and St. Gertrude were almost a proverb for\r\nrevelry.\r\n\r\nLet us observe, _en passant_, that _minne_, lately in honour of Minna\r\nTroil erected into a lady’s name, is from the Gothic _munan_, to\r\nremember, from the Saxon form of which we take our _mind_. Minnie has\r\nlately become a favourite name, and must be referred to this source.\r\n\r\nA second St. Gertrude, of noble blood in Saxony, was abbess of Heldelfs,\r\nhad an exceedingly high reputation for sanctity, and died in 1334,\r\nleaving her name doubly popular.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │Gertrude       │Gertrude       │Gertrude       │Gertrudes      │\r\n   │Gatty          │               │Geltruda       │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │ Netherlands.  │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Gertraud       │Traudl         │Drutje         │Gertrud        │\r\n   │Trudchen       │Traul          │Trudje         │Jartrud        │\r\n   │               │               │Trudel         │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Slovak.    │   Lettish.    │     Esth.     │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Jera           │Gêrde          │Kert           │Giertruda      │\r\n   │Jerica         │Gerte          │Truto          │   ————————    │\r\n   │Jedert         │Gedde          │Truta          │  Lithuanian.  │\r\n   │Jra            │               │               │Trude          │\r\n   │               │               │               │   ————————    │\r\n   │               │               │               │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │               │               │               │Gertrud        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThere is great confusion between Gerwald and Gerhard; the one meaning\r\nspear power, the other firm spear.\r\n\r\nThough _gar_ was not a common English prefix, the first Saint Gerhold\r\nwas Anglo-Saxon. He migrated to Ireland, received the cowl in the\r\nmonastery of Mayo, founded that of Tempul Gerald, died in 732, and\r\nbecame the subject of one of the Irish legends of saints. It declared\r\nthat the wife of Caomhan, king of Connaught, turned him out of the fort\r\nof Cathair Mhor, with his 300 saints, who thereupon joined him in one of\r\nthe peculiar prayers of Irish saints, that there never should be another\r\nking of the same race for ever. However, he afterwards relented, and\r\nonly cut off from the throne the offspring of the lady herself, while to\r\nthose of the king’s former wife he granted the right of sitting first in\r\nthe drinking house and of arraying the battle. The Irish call him\r\nGaralt, and have confused his name with the Keltic Gareth, one of the\r\nknights of the Round Table, so that Garrett and Gerald are regarded as\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThe great prevalence of the name in Ireland is, however, chiefly owing\r\nto the Normans. There had been two Frank saints thus called in the\r\ntwelfth century, Gerard of Toul, and Girroald of Fontenelle; but it was\r\nalso a Lombardic name, and the old Florentine family of the Gherardi\r\nclaims the parentage of one of the many Gerolds who accompanied William\r\nthe Conqueror, the same whose descendant, Maurice Fitzgerald, was one of\r\nthe companions of Earl Strongbow, the parent of the Fitzgeralds, or\r\nGeraldins, of Kildare, the turbulent race, who disputed with the Butlers\r\nof Ormond the supremacy of the island. Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, a\r\ndaughter of this house, was the lady who, in imitation of Beatrice and\r\nof Laura, was erected by Surrey into the heroine of his poetry, under\r\nthe title of the Fair Geraldine, thus leading to the adoption of this\r\nlatter as one of the class of romantic Christian names. Gerald Barry,\r\nthe Welsh chronicler who Latinizes himself as Giraldus Cambrensis, may\r\nhave been rightly Gareth, and the provincial form Jarrett, still common\r\nin the North, is probably rather a remnant of the Gareth of Strathclyde,\r\nthan a version of the Norman Gerald.\r\n\r\nAnother St. Gerald, bishop of Namur, left his name to be very common in\r\nthe Low Countries, where we have already shown how curiously the\r\ntransformation was effected of Gerhard Gerhardson into Desiderius\r\nErasmus. Lastly, a St. Gerhard went on a mission to convert the\r\nHungarians, and the name, or rather the two names, for there is no\r\ndistinguishing between them, have become universal.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Gerard         │Gerard         │Girart         │Gherardo       │\r\n   │Garrett        │Giraud         │Guerart        │Gerardo        │\r\n   │Jarett         │Girairs        │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │ Netherlands.  │    Dutch.     │   Frisian.    │\r\n   │Gerhard        │Gerard         │Gerhardus      │Geerd          │\r\n   │               │Gerrit         │Gerrit         │               │\r\n   │               │Geert          │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Danish.    │    Polish.    │   Lettish.    │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Gerhard        │Gieraud        │Gerkis         │Geller         │\r\n   │Geert          │               │Gêrts          │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  German.   │  Frisian.  │\r\n   │Gerald      │Giraud      │Giraldo     │Gerold      │Gerold      │\r\n   │            │Guirauld    │            │            │Gerelt      │\r\n   │            │Girault     │            │            │Gerel       │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nGerhardine in German, and Giralda in Italian, are the feminines, besides\r\nour own Geraldine. Possibly Giralda may once have been the Valkyr name\r\nGeirhilda, which has survived in the North in the form of Jerilla, _jer_\r\nbeing the northern corruption of _geir_. Jerlau is thus Geirlaug, and\r\nJeruf, or Jerul, Geirolf.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, though with different pronunciation, we make Jervis out\r\nof the old Norman Gervais, which was probably Geirfuss, or warlike\r\neagerness. It used to be explained as _gerfast_, all firm, but this is,\r\nof course, wrong; though, as I have not found Geirfuss in the roll of\r\nnorthern names, and it would have been Gerfuns in Germany, where Gerwas\r\nis common, as is Gervais in France, and Gervaso in Italy, this must be\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThe Gerberge of French history, the queen of Louis l'Outremer, was the\r\nsame as the Geirbjorg of the North: Gerwin, or spear friend, made the\r\nGuarin of France, whence the Waryn of a few English families, and\r\nGuarino of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe old Spanish-Gothic feminine Garsendis was certainly Garswinth, or\r\nspear strength, and the equally ancient Garsias, or Garcia, so common in\r\nGalicia and Navarre, must have its commencement from the same source,\r\nthough the last syllable has lost its individuality on the soft Spanish\r\ntongues. It was long a royal name, but was dropped about the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and makes its last public appearance in the person of the\r\nPeruvian prince and author Garcilasso de la Vega.\r\n\r\nThe spear raven, Gerramn, is the old English Jerram, that has become\r\nlost in Jerome; and the spear prince, Gerbold, has furnished the family\r\nname of Garibaldi. _Gar_ is very rare in native Anglo-Saxon names,\r\nwhether as a beginning or end, but most frequent in all the other\r\nbranches of the Teuton stock; and its other form, _gais_, is the most\r\nreasonable explanation of the beginning of the name of Geisserich, the\r\nking of the Vandals, who has been made into Genserich, and then\r\ntranslated into the Gander king!

If the _Nibelungenlied_\r\nbe really another form of the Eddaic myth, Folker may answer to Bragi,\r\nthe god of poetry, but he has his own individual character of blithe\r\nundaunted courage. Even when the terrible battle has begun, and the\r\nheroes find themselves hemmed in by Chriemhild’s warriors, Folker\r\nfiddles on, until he dies by the hand of Hildebram.\r\n\r\nFolker’s name is from our own word _folk_, the near relation of the\r\nLatin _vulgus_, whose progeny are found all over Europe in _vulgar_,\r\n_vulgo_, _foule_, &c. Most likely Folkvard is really the right version,\r\nand would mean people’s guard, and Folker is rather its corruption than\r\nindependently the people’s warrior, and the same with Folko; they are,\r\ntherefore, all thrown together in the following table.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │English.       │German.        │Frisian.       │Nor.           │\r\n   │Fulk           │Volquard       │Folkert        │Folkvard       │\r\n   │   ————————    │Volkvart       │Foke           │Folke          │\r\n   │    French.    │Folkward       │Fokko          │Fokke          │\r\n   │Fulcher        │Folquhard      │               │               │\r\n   │Feuquiers      │Folkhard       │               │               │\r\n   │Foulques       │Folker         │               │               │\r\n   │Fouques        │Folko          │               │               │\r\n   │               │Fulko          │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nIn the Foulques stage, this name was home, alternately with Geoffroi, by\r\nthe counts of Anjou, and with the strange soubriquets of _Nerra_ and\r\n_Réchin_. One of these counts, the grandfather of our Henry II., became\r\nking of Jerusalem; but our English Angevins did not perpetuate the name;\r\nand though six Fulcos are recorded in Domesday, Fulk never took root in\r\nEngland, and is chiefly remembered because it belonged to Fulk Greville,\r\nthe friend of Sydney. It was, in fact, with all its varieties, chiefly\r\nBurgundian.\r\n\r\nGermany shows a few other forms: Folkwin, or Volquin, which exactly\r\nanswers to Demophilos, or Publicola; Folkrad, Folkrich, and Folkmar;\r\nalso Folkbert, which some prefer to Wilibert, as the origin of the\r\nSavoyard Filiberto, and our Fulbert.[135]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  _Nibelungenlied_; Weber and Jamieson; Munch; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION IX.—_Dankwart._\r\n\r\nIn the _Nibelungenlied_ the father of Chriemhilt, who dwelt at Wurms,\r\nwas ‘hight Dankrat,’ and the marshal at the court was Dankwart the\r\nswift, Hagen’s brother. Innocent as he was of a share in his brother’s\r\ncrime, he was the first to be assailed while he was dining with Etzel’s\r\nknights, and he had to fight his way through Chriemhild’s warriors\r\nbefore he could return to his comrades in the hall, when he kept the\r\ndoor until, like all the rest, he perished in the massacre.\r\n\r\nThe first syllable of the name is the same as our word _thank_, and the\r\nname means thankful or grateful. The father of Chriemhild was thus\r\nThank-rede, or grateful speech, and from him the Northmen seem to have\r\ntaken their Thakraad, which in Normandy became Tancred, the knight of\r\nHauteville, whose twelve gallant sons chased the Saracens from Apulia,\r\nand were the founders of the only brave dynasty that ever ruled in the\r\nenervating realms of the Two Sicilies. The son of one of these gallant\r\nknights, Tancredi di Puglia, was the foremost in the first crusade, and\r\nthe favourite hero of Tasso, in whose epic he is a Christian Achilles;\r\nand Tancredi again was the last Sicilian king of the true Norman line,\r\nthe same whose bickerings with Cœur de Lion make so unpleasant an\r\nepisode in the third Crusade.\r\n\r\nDankwart, thankful guardian, lingered in Germany; and in 1668, a\r\nYorkshire register records the baptism of Tankard, the son of a ‘Turkey\r\nmerchant,’ who had probably learnt the name from some of his foreign\r\nconnections. Dankheri, thankful warrior, was in Normandy Tancar. Dankker\r\nis the German surname, and has even come to Tanzen; so that our surname\r\nDance may have the same origin. Thangbrand was the German priest whom\r\nKing Olaf Tryggvesen of Norway sent to convert Iceland, but whose\r\nseverity led to his expulsion; and Germany also mentions Dankmar; but\r\nthe prefix is almost exclusively German.[136]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  _Nibelungenlied_; Munch; Pott.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION X.—_Theodoric._\r\n\r\nTheodoric of Bern is hardly a genuine hero of the _Nibelung_, being\r\nreally the main figure in a cycle of Germanic romances of his own; but\r\nas he, under the abbreviation Dietrich, is brought in to play a\r\nconsiderable part in the final action of the tale, this seems the\r\nfittest place for treating of him and the names in connection with him.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have been brought into the _Nibelungenlied_ because the\r\nGermanic mind could conceive of nothing considerable passing without\r\nhim. He is represented as one of the four-and-twenty princes in King\r\nEtzel’s train, and as anxious to prevent mischief to the visitors from\r\nBurgundy, warning them of Chriemhilt’s enmity, and refusing to attack\r\nthem at her request. When the great slaughter began, it was Dietrich who\r\nconveyed the king and queen safely out of the _mêlée_, and withheld his\r\nmen from engaging in it, until almost at the end, when they could no\r\nlonger be restrained, and rushing into the fray were all slain except\r\nold Sir Hildebrand, though on the other hand, Gunther and Haghen alone\r\nremained alive of the Burgundians. Dietrich then armed himself, and\r\nafter a fierce combat, made them both prisoners, and delivered them up\r\nto Chriemhilt, fully intending that she should spare their lives; but\r\nwhen her relentless fury had fallen on them, he assisted King Etzel to\r\nbury the dead, and to return the horses and armour of their fallen\r\nchampions to their respective countries.\r\n\r\nOther German romances, however, elevate this prince to a much higher\r\nrank. The _Book of Heroes_, written by Wolfram of Eschenbach and\r\nHeinrich of Ofterdingen, makes Dietrich of Bern, in Lombardy, son of\r\nKing Dietmar. Hearing of Chriemhilt’s rose garden, which measured seven\r\nmiles round, and was guarded by twelve champions, he was seized with a\r\ndesire to do battle with them, for love of battle, not of ladies, though\r\nthe victor was to receive a chaplet of roses and a kiss from the young\r\nlady. The wise old Sir Hildebrand, of the Wolfing line, conducted him\r\nand his eleven companion champions to Wurms, where the single combats\r\ntook place. Dietrich’s knights were successful, and for the most part\r\ntook the Chaplets, but refused the kisses, because they disdained\r\nChriemhild as a faithless maiden.\r\n\r\nA Danish ballad describes ‘Kong Tidrich’s’ tremendous battle with a\r\nLindwurm, the progeny of one that had escaped his great-grandfather\r\nWolfdietrich. He was led to enter on the battle by entreaties for help\r\nfrom a lion whom the dragon had seized; but at first he came by the\r\nworst, for his sword broke, and\r\n\r\n                  ‘The Lindwurm took him on her back,\r\n                    His steed beneath her tongue,\r\n                  Bore them into the hollow hill\r\n                    To her eleven young.’\r\n\r\nShe bade them eat the horse to pass away the time while she rested,\r\npromising that on her awakening they should devour the knight. In the\r\ncave, however, Tidrich found the magic sword of Siegfried and two\r\nknives; and in spite of the threats of the young dragons, and the\r\npromises of the old one, he killed them all; but the old worm fell so as\r\nto choke the mouth of the cave, whereupon the friendly lion dug him out,\r\nand supplied the place of the slain steed by carrying him to Bern on his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nSo much for romance. History mentions a real Theodoric, son of\r\nTheudemir, and king of the Ostrogoths in Italy, from 475 to 527. He had\r\nbeen sent as a hostage to Constantinople, and there educated; and though\r\nhe could not write his name, and had a stamp perforated with the letters\r\nTheod to enable him to sign his edicts, he was exceeding able, wise, and\r\nskilful, and Arian as he was, conciliated the love of the Catholics.\r\nVerona was his chief city, and is evidently the Bern of the romances. He\r\nlived too late for the historical Attila, who had died in 453; and\r\nthough there is a report of a previous Theodoric, who meddled in a\r\ndissension between Attila’s sons, and took part in a great slaughter\r\nthat lasted fifteen days, it is most likely that the original Theuderik\r\nwas a mythical personage, after whom these historical princes were\r\ncalled, and who afterwards received the credit of some of their deeds,\r\nand was localized in the places of their dominion. It is in favour of\r\nthis notion that Dietrich of Berne is one of the many titles of the wild\r\nhuntsman, though the Lusatians corrupt him into Dietrich Bernhard, and\r\nthe Low Countries into Dirk-mit-den-Beer, or with the beard. Indeed,\r\nDirk, the Dutch form of Theodoric, was a half-mythical king of Holland.\r\n\r\nIt was a most universal name, Anglo-Saxon and Visigothic, as well as\r\nFrank and German; and two saints made it everywhere popular in the\r\nmiddle ages, though the Dutch at present chiefly use it.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │Span. and Port.│\r\n   │Theodric       │Theodoric      │Teodorico      │Theodorico     │\r\n   │Theodoric      │Thierry        │Dieterico      │               │\r\n   │Derrick        │Thian          │               │               │\r\n   │Terry          │Thean          │               │               │\r\n   │Tedric         │               │               │               │\r\n   │  (_Domesday_) │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │   Frisian.    │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Diotrich       │Dietl          │Tiaderik       │Tjodrckr       │\r\n   │Dietrich       │   ————————    │Tiarik         │Didhrikr       │\r\n   │Diez           │    Dutch.     │Tiark          │Theodrckr      │\r\n   │Diether        │Diederik       │Tiado          │Tidrich        │\r\n   │               │Dierk          │Tiaddo         │Didrik         │\r\n   │               │Dirk           │Todo           │   ————————    │\r\n   │               │               │Tade           │    Slovak.    │\r\n   │               │               │Tido           │Todorik        │\r\n   │               │               │Tide           │               │\r\n   │               │               │Dudde          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │   Lettish.    │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Dytrych        │Detrich        │Diriks         │               │\r\n   │               │               │Didschis       │Ditrik         │\r\n   │               │               │Tiz            │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe name of Dietmar, the father of Theodoric, is to be found in many\r\nforms; in Theudemir, a Frank, who faithfully served Constantius; in an\r\nOstrogothic Theodomir; Spanish, Theodomiro; and the modern Frisian,\r\nThiadmar, Tiedmer, Tyeddemer, Tidmer.

Ortwin, of Metz, was\r\n_truchsess_, or carver, and was the nephew of Hagan and Dankwart,\r\nsharing, of course, their fate.\r\n\r\nThey are not very interesting personages, but it is curious that they\r\nbear the only names, among all the Nibelungen, which have any genuine\r\nAnglo-Saxon likenesses; that is, if Uote is, indeed, from the word in\r\nAnglo-Saxon, _ead_, in the North _aud_, in Mæso-Gothic _audr_, in High\r\nGerman _od_, everywhere meaning wealth. Some ascribe it to the same root\r\nas _good_ and as _Woden_, including them with _adel_, noble; but its\r\nderivatives are more easy to follow than its forefathers.\r\n\r\nIn the North, _odel_ is the term for property to which an entire family\r\nretains an equal right, _all-od_, or allodial property. But when the\r\nwarriors made incursions on their neighbours, they obtained, in\r\naddition, their share of spoil, originally cattle, _feh_, or _feo_, i.\r\ne., their _fee_. So _feh-od_ came to be the word for possessions gained\r\nby the individual by personal service to his lord, and thus passed from\r\ncattle to land itself, when held of the chief on condition of following\r\nhim in war; and thus we have the _feudal_ system, with its _feoffs_ and,\r\ntoo often, its _feuds_.\r\n\r\nThe feminine of this word probably named Uta. It was popular everywhere.\r\nAudur-diupaudga, or Audur the deeply rich, was a female viking, one of\r\nthe first Icelandic settlers, who called a promontory Kambness, because\r\nshe dropped her comb upon it; nor has her name passed from her own\r\ncountry, while, in Norman-England, it appears first as Auda and then as\r\nAlda, answering to Alda the wife of Orlando the Paladin, and Alda queen\r\nof Italy in 926, also to another Alda, a lady of the house of Este, in\r\n1393. These are from the Gothic and Scandinavian _aud_; but the High\r\nGerman form was also represented by Oda and the Low German by the old\r\nSaxon Ead, which was soon translated into Ide, the most common of all\r\nthe early feminines in the Cambrai register, together with its\r\ndiminutive Idette. Ida was the name of King Stephen’s granddaughter, the\r\nCountess of Boulogne, was always used in Germany, and has of late been\r\nrevived in England, from its sounding like the title of a poetical\r\nmountain of the Troad.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear whether Othilie, the Alsatian virgin of the\r\nseventh century, who was said to have been born blind, but to have\r\nobtained sight at her baptism, is a form of Odel, noble, or a diminutive\r\nof Oda, or whether she is Otthild, answering to our Eadhild, one of the\r\nmany sisters of Æthelstane: and there is the same doubt with Odilo and\r\nOdilon, the masculines.\r\n\r\nThe masculine form of _aud_ was extremely common. We had it in the\r\nperson of Ida, king of Bernicia; the North owned many an Audr; the\r\nGermans used Odde, Orto, and Otto, and when the gallant Saxon counts won\r\nthe imperial crown, they took the old Latin Otho for the rendering of\r\ntheir name. France, meantime, had called her Burgundian prince Eudon,\r\nbut when a relay of Norman Audrs appeared, they were Odons; and in the\r\nneedlework with which Queen Matilda adorned Bayeux cathedral, her\r\nhusband’s doughty episcopal half-brother is always labelled ‘Odo Eps.’\r\nBut though we had previously had a grim Danish archbishop Odo, and\r\nthough Domesday shows plenty of Eudos and Odos, neither form took root,\r\nand both are entirely continental.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  French.   │ Provençal. │  Italian.  │  German.   │    Nor.    │\r\n   │Odon        │Orzil       │Otto        │Odo         │Audr        │\r\n   │Eudon       │  ————————  │Ottone      │Otto        │Odo         │\r\n   │Eudes       │  Lettish.  │Ottorino    │Orto        │Oddr        │\r\n   │Othes       │Atte        │            │Otho        │            │\r\n   │            │Attinsch    │            │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nOrtvin the truchsess, had his namesake in the Lombard Audoin father to\r\nAlboin, also, in the Frank Audwine, blessed by St. Columbanus, beloved\r\nby St. Eligius, and bishop of Rouen, whose loveliest church is that of\r\nSt. Audoenus, now transformed by French lips into St. Ouen. And, at\r\nhome, we hail the same ‘rich friend’ in Eadwine, the first Christian\r\nking of Northumbria, whose conversion is the most striking portion of\r\nBede’s history. His dominion extended over the Lothians, and he disputes\r\nwith Aodh and the Ædui the naming of Edinburgh. Beloved as he was, his\r\nname of Edwin never entirely died away, and became in modern times\r\ndiffused by the popularity of Goldsmith’s ballad, and of Beattie’s\r\n_Minstrel_. It is just known upon the Continent. Ortwin, or Audoenius,\r\nis very possibly the Don Ordoño of the early Spanish kingdoms; but\r\nGermany has chiefly dealt in the independent Odvin. Edwin, in spite of\r\nMr. Taylor’s tragedy of _Edwin the Fair_, is not the same as Edwy,\r\nnamely Eadwig, rich war, a name well remembered for the unhappy fate of\r\nthe owner.\r\n\r\nOdoacer, as the Romans called him, who was put to death by Theodoric,\r\nwas properly Audvakr, treasure watcher; not quite the same as the\r\nGermanic Ottokar, or Ortgar, happy spear, which is identical with our\r\nfamiliar Eadgar, or Edgar. This name, after being laid to rest with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon monarchy, came to life again with the taste for antiques;\r\nand Edgar Ravenswood, in his operatic character, has brought Edgar and\r\nEdgardo.\r\n\r\nEadmund, or happy protection, is one of our most English names,\r\nbelonging to the king of East Anglia, who, as the first victim of the\r\nDanes, became the patron saint of Bury St. Edmund’s, and the subject of\r\nvarious legends. The sudden deaths of Sweyn, and afterwards of Eustace\r\nde Blois, when engaged in ravaging his shrine, made him be regarded as\r\nan efficient protector; and Henry III., when he had the good taste to\r\nmake his sons Englishmen, christened the second after this national\r\nsaint, so that Edmunds were always to be found in the House of\r\nPlantagenet, and thence among the nobility and the whole nation. The\r\nIrish called it Emmon, the Danes adopted it as Jatmund, in addition to\r\ntheir own Oddmund, the French occasionally use it as Edmond, and Italy\r\nknows it as Edmondo.\r\n\r\nThe most really noted of all our own genuine appellations is, however,\r\nEadvard, the rich guardian. It comes to light in our royal line with the\r\nson of Alfred, and won the popular love for the sake of the young king\r\nwhom St. Dunstan and the English called the martyr, in their pity for\r\nhis untimely fate. And again, little as ‘the Confessor’ had been loved\r\nin his feeble lifetime, enthusiastic affection attached to him as the\r\nlast native sovereign; while, on the one hand, it was the policy of the\r\nNorman kings to regard him as their natural predecessor, and of the\r\nbarons to appeal to the laws that had prevailed in his time. All parties\r\nthus were ready to elect St. Edward to be the patron saint of England,\r\nand, in the ardour of embellishing his foundation of Westminster Abbey,\r\nit was natural to give his name to the heir of the crown, afterwards\r\n‘the greatest of the Plantagenets.’ The deaths of his three children\r\nbearing Norman or Spanish names confirmed this as the royal name, and\r\nthe third king so called spread it far and wide. It was carried by his\r\ngranddaughter to Portugal, and there had its honour so well sustained by\r\nher noble son, as there to find another home; and with us it has\r\nrecurred continually in every rank.\r\n\r\nThe contraction Neddy, common to all of these, is one of the titles of a\r\ndonkey.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Welsh.     │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Edward         │Jorwarth       │Edouard        │Odoardo        │\r\n   │Neddy          │    Irish.     │               │               │\r\n   │Teddy          │Eudbaird       │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │    German.    │     Nor.      │ Netherlands.  │\r\n   │Duarte         │Eduard         │Jaward         │Ede            │\r\n   │               │Oddward        │Audvard        │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe other less celebrated parallel varieties are:—\r\n\r\n     ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n     │                Eng.

Eadgyth was undoubtedly the name of Earl Godwin’s daughter, of\r\nwhom Ingulf said, ‘_Sicut spina rosam, genuit Godwinus Egitham_;’ but in\r\nthe roll of her lands in Domesday, she is Eddeva, Eddid, and Edeva, and\r\nfor some little time Edeva seems to have been used among the Normans,\r\nthough the queen of Henry I. was not allowed to retain anything so\r\nSaxon. Aline and Edith were used in a few families, but Edith survived\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n_Giav_ or _give_ is not a very common commencement; but in the Vilkina\r\nSaga, King Gjuko is the father of Gunnar and Gudrun, and the whole\r\nfamily are called Giukungr. In German, in the _Book of Heroes_, he is\r\nGibicho, and there was really a historical Burgundian King Gibica,\r\nmentioned as a law-giver; but in the _Nibelungen-nôt_, Gibich is only a\r\nvassal king of Etzel’s. The North had Gjaflaug, liquor giver, no doubt\r\nthe Hebe of the Norse banquets, Gjavvald, in German, Gevald, and perhaps\r\nGabilo and Gavele, the Gebelius of Latinists. Germany had likewise\r\nGebahard, a firm or perhaps a strong giver, which still survives under\r\nthe unpromising sound of Gebhard.\r\n\r\nGyda, or Gytha, that most difficult name, sometimes sounds like Gith,\r\nthe contraction of Eadgyth; but it was evidently northern, having\r\nbelonged to the proud damsel of Hordaland, who refused to marry Harald\r\nHarfagre, unless he was sole king of all Norway. Afterwards it was borne\r\nby the semi-Danish ladies of Earl Godwin’s family, and melted into\r\nGjutha, then became confounded with Jutta, which was considered as short\r\nfor Juditha.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION XII.—_Sintram._\r\n\r\nSindolt was the _schenke_, or butler, at the court of Wurms, in the\r\n_Niebelungenlied_; and in the Vilkina Saga, Sintram is one of the heroes\r\nof Thidrek’s following. The derivation of the first syllable is\r\nuncertain. Michaelis takes it from the old High German _sinths_, a\r\njourney. Professor Munch refers Sindre to a word meaning sparkling or\r\nspark, and mentions a mythological dwarf who was a famous smith, and was\r\nyclept Sindre; also a poet in Harald Harfagre’s time, whose appellation\r\nwas Guthorm Sindre, or the sparkling. Sundre or Sondre is, the same\r\nauthority tells us, more used in the Thellmarken in Norway than\r\nelsewhere; and another possible derivation for it is from ‘_sondra_,’ to\r\nsunder. The forms Sunrir and Sunris are there found; and Germany had a\r\nfew others, such as Sindwald, or Sindolt, Sindbald, the Sinibaldo of\r\nItaly, Sindbert, Sindolf, and the above-mentioned Sindhram, chiefly\r\ninteresting to us as chosen by Fouqué for the name of his masterpiece,\r\nthe wonderful allegory spun out of Albert Durer’s more wonderful\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION XIII.—_Elberich._\r\n\r\nThe elf king Elberich here brings in his own fairy kindred. In the\r\n_Nibelung_, he is watching over the fatal treasure when Siegfried comes\r\nto claim it, and, dwarf as he is, does such fierce battle over it that\r\nSiegfried was ‘in bitter jeopardy;’ but he is at length overcome sworn\r\nto Siegfried’s service, and brought by him to Wurms, where he has no\r\nmore to do but to lament when Haghen makes away with the treasure.\r\n\r\nHe is called very ancient, and well he may be, for he had appeared in\r\nthe _Book of Heroes_ long before the time of even Hughdietrich, when\r\nKing Otnit of Lombardy had set forth to win the daughter of the king of\r\nSyria, and Elberich showed himself under a linden tree in the guise of a\r\nbeautiful child. Otnit was about to pick him up, but received from him a\r\ntremendous blow, and after a sharp fight came to terms, and thenceforth\r\nhe assisted him in his enterprise, gave him magic armour, and assisted\r\nhim to gain the lady. Much of this story is repeated in the French\r\nromance of _Huon de Bourdeaux_, where Auberon, as he is there called,\r\ngives the knight an ivory horn wherewith to summon him to his aid in an\r\nemergency, and thus arose the English Oberon, the elf-rik or king, the\r\ngraceful but petulant fairy whom Drayton marries to the Irish Mab, and\r\nShakespeare to the Greek Titania. He had his human namesakes, too;\r\nAlberich was in fashion as a Frank name, as Ælfric was as a Saxon; and\r\nthe Domesday Book shows that while we had plenty of the latter native\r\nform, Edward the Confessor had already imported two specimens of\r\n‘Albericus comes,’ and these or their sons contracted into Aubrey, which\r\nwas known to fame as almost hereditary among the De Veres, earls of\r\nOxford. France, too, had her Aubri; and Alberico was used in Lombardy,\r\nwhere likewise the notable and terrible monarch Alboin, whose name as\r\nAlboino is still common among the peasantry, bore the name that\r\nAnglo-Saxons called Ælfwine, or elf-friend, perhaps likewise an allusion\r\nto the aid and friendship of ‘Oberon the faëry,’ whose first protégé was\r\na Lombard. Alwine is the feminine used in Germany, and _perhaps_ may be\r\nour Albinia.\r\n\r\nThe elf of England and Germany, the _alfr_ of the North, was a being\r\ndear to the imagination of the people. His name means the _white_, the\r\nsame word already mentioned as forming the Latin _albus_, and\r\ndesignating the Elbe and the Alps, as well as appearing in the Elphin of\r\nCymric legend. The elves, or white spirits, were supposed to be\r\nbeautiful shadowy gifted beings, often strangely influencing the life of\r\nmortals, so that in old Germany the Alfr were the genii of man’s life,\r\nlike the Disir of the North; and Elberich probably originally attended\r\nOtnit in this capacity. Christianity did not destroy the faith in the\r\nelf-world, but the existence of these beings was accounted for by\r\nsupposing them children of Eve, whom she had hidden from the face of her\r\nMaker, and He had therefore condemned to be hidden from the face of man.\r\nThey were thought to mourn for their exclusion from Redemption, and to\r\nseek baptism for their infants; but in process of time their higher\r\nattributes dropped off from them, and they were mixed up with the\r\nmalicious black dwarfs. They took to stealing young maidens, as the\r\nScottish Burd Ellen, and to exchanging infants in the cradle; and\r\nScotland created an Elfinland, which was a striking element of worldly\r\nvanity. In England, the traditions of the Keltic spirits, pucks and\r\npixies, were mixed up with them, and our Elizabethan poets treated them\r\nas the males of the French fairies; and what comes to us so recommended,\r\nsurely we must accept.\r\n\r\nThese elves, in their more dignified days, played a considerable part in\r\nour native nomenclature; nay, the most honoured of all our English\r\nsovereigns wrote himself upon his jewel Ælfred, _i.e._, Elf in council,\r\nwise as a supernatural being. Some have tried to read the word Alfried,\r\nall peace; but there is no doubt that the Elf is the right prefix. The\r\nEnglish loved to continue his name, but it was Latinized as Aluredus,\r\nand thus Alured is the form in which it is borne by many persons\r\nrecorded in Domesday, and is still kept up and regarded as a separate\r\nname, though Alfred has been within the last century resumed in England;\r\nit is much used about the good king’s birth-place at Wantage in\r\nBerkshire, and has of late been adopted in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nÆlfhæg was as high as an elf; whether given to a very small infant, or\r\nsupposed to refer to a being of unearthly stature, does not appear. It\r\nwas the very inappropriate name of the archbishop who, under Ethelred\r\nthe Unready, was pelted to death at a Danish banquet because he would\r\nnot oppress his flock to obtain a ransom. The offence given by Lanfranc\r\nin refusing to regard him as a true martyr may be judged by the large\r\nnumbers called after him in Domesday. In Sussex they are set down as\r\nÆlfech; in Hants as Ælfec; in Nottingham as Ælfag; and thanks to the\r\nLatinism of Alphegius, our calendar calls him Alphege.\r\n\r\nÆlfgifu, or the elf gift, was the unfortunate Elgiva of history, a not\r\nunsuitable name for one whose beauty was like a fatal fairy gift,\r\nbringing ruin on her and on her husband; but it was also used to\r\ntranslate into Saxon that of the Norman Emma, which was regarded as too\r\nforeign for the Saxons. Knut’s first wife, Ælfwine (elf darling), the\r\ndaughter of Ælfhelm, Earl of Southampton, is recorded by Dugdale as\r\nAilive; and Aileve, Ælveva, or Alveva, is very common in Domesday.\r\nAileve indeed continued in use for many years.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was England that made by far the most use of elf names. The\r\nNorth was perhaps the next in the use of them, having an immense number\r\nof instances of Alfr in the _Landnama-bok_, but there the elf at the end\r\nof a word has such an unfortunate tendency to transform himself into a\r\nwolf, that it is impossible to tell which was the original, the same\r\nperson being sometimes written Thoralf, and sometimes Thorulf. There are\r\nfew instances preserved from the other Teutonic branches, except as we\r\nhave seen the two Lombardic names, that seem direct from Elberich.\r\n\r\nEnglish names in Æthel often contract into El, and when followed by an\r\n_f_, appear to be _elves_; but they must be pursued to their original\r\nform before being so rendered.\r\n\r\n          ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n          │           Nor.

Otherwise these would be referred to the word in\r\nGothic, _aljan_, meaning battle, found in the Old German Ellanheri and\r\nEllanperaht.\r\n\r\nSome of our commencing _els_ are no doubt from the fairy source; but\r\nthere are others very difficult to account for, beginning in Anglo-Saxon\r\nwith _ealh_, which is either a hall, or without the final _h_, the\r\nadjective _all_, by which in fact they are generally translated. The\r\nmost noted of them is Ealhwine, the tutor of Charlemagne’s sons,\r\ngenerally called Alcuin, though his name has remained at home as Aylwin.\r\nSome Aylwins, are, however, certainly from Ægilwine, or awful friend;\r\nEalhfrith, Ealhmund, and Ealhred, are also found, and one of these must\r\nhave formed the modern Eldred. Among ladies are Ealhfled, and Ealhswyth,\r\nor Alswitha. On the whole it seems to us that the _hall_ is the more\r\nprobable derivation; the _h_ so carefully used in the Saxon Chronicle is\r\nunlike a contraction.[138]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Weber and Jamieson; St. Pelaye, _Huon de Bourdeaux_; Grimm;\r\n  Keightley; Lappenburg; _Landnama-bok_; _Domesday_; Scott, _Minstrelsy\r\n  of Scottish Border_; Sharon Turner; Kemble, _Names of the\r\n  Anglo-Saxons_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                         THE KARLING ROMANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION I.—_The Paladins._\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable cycle of romantic fable connected itself with a\r\nprince, not lost in the dim light of heroic legend, but described by a\r\ncontemporary chronicler, and revealed in the full light of history.\r\nHowever, in reality, the records of Eginhard were, no doubt, as unread\r\nand unknown as if they had never existed, and with the notion that a\r\nmagnificent prince had reigned over half Europe, there was ample scope\r\nfor tradition to connect with him and his followers all the floating\r\nadventures that Teutonic, Keltic, or Latin invention had framed; and,\r\nby-and-by, literature recorded them, using them as her own world of\r\nbeauty and of wonder, until nothing but the names were left in common\r\nwith their originals.\r\n\r\nFrance, Germany, Lombardy, and Spain, all looked back to the same\r\nemperor, and hung their traditions around him, with a far more national\r\nsentiment than it was possible for them to possess for the British\r\nArthur. In the Charles who bore the surname of the Great, all the\r\nlegends centred. He was at once emperor, and, like his grandfather,\r\nchampion of Europe against the Saracens, with whom in popular fancy,\r\nboth his own Saxons and his grandson’s Northmen were fused together; he\r\nwas besieged, like his grandson, in Paris, and lost all his best\r\nfollowers in the pass of Roncesvalles, by the treachery of the\r\nNavarrese.\r\n\r\nThese were the materials that fancy had to work upon. The existing\r\nfeudal system supplied the machinery, and not with utter incorrectness,\r\nsince it had actually then existed in its infancy, and the chiefs of the\r\nFrank court were veritably obliged to pay martial service to their head\r\nfor the lands that they had received from him on the conquest of the\r\ncountry. _Pfalz_, the same word which we now call _palace_, the central\r\ncourt, furnished the title for the feudatories employed at the court;\r\n_Pfalzen_, a word that continued in use in its proper region, Germany,\r\nnaming the Pfalzgraf of the Rhine, whence we have learnt to speak of the\r\nCount Palatine and the Palatinate.\r\n\r\nPfalzen, then, on French tongues, became Paladins, and Paladins were\r\nsupposed to have been not so much political as military, so that we\r\nregard the term as meaning a champion of high prowess. There was an idea\r\nlikewise of a council of these Paladins as the twelve peers of France in\r\nthe golden age of her constitution; and the Docipairs, as the Douzepairs\r\nwere sometimes run together, stood on a level in romantic imaginations\r\nwith the Seven Champions of Christendom, or the Knights of the Round\r\nTable.\r\n\r\nSpanish ballads, German lays, and Provençal songs, had been working up\r\nthe stories of the Paladins, when somewhere about the year 1100, there\r\ncame forth a French translation of the supposed chronicle of Turpin, who\r\nhad really been archbishop of Rheims in the reign of Charlemagne. The\r\nchronicle was confirmed in 1122 by the infallible authority of the Pope,\r\nand was translated again and again, amplified and referred to by every\r\none who wrote or sung of the Paladins, for the events they celebrated,\r\nwhether it contained them or not.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Karlingen upon our subject has been great. First,\r\nsome of the genuine historical characters left hereditary Christian\r\nnames; next, several were adopted in romantic and chivalrous families,\r\nand in the poetical ages of literary Italy, they became absolutely\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nPaladins, however, connect themselves with hardly any genuine female\r\nnames of the same period. The Ossianic Fenians have their wives and\r\nbeloved maidens, the knights of the Round Table are united with ladies\r\nof Cymric title, like their own, and evidently as traditionary as\r\nthemselves; the dames of the _Nibelungenlied_ are intimately connected\r\nwith the whole structure of the legend; but the knights of Charlemagne\r\nhave brought with them few genuine ladye loves. Orlando once had a wife,\r\nthe Alda, or Belinda, of the old traditions; but even the Clarice of\r\nRenaud in the _Quatre Fils Aymon_, betrays a late French, or rather\r\nRomanesque, influence; and far more do the Doña Clara, Belerma, and\r\nSebilla of the Spanish ballads, show how late they must have arisen;\r\nwhilst Angelica, Marfisa, Bradamante, Fiordespina, and Fiordiligi, and\r\nthe like, are absolute Italian inventions.\r\n\r\nThe Frankish ladies seem, in fact, to have been held in little\r\nestimation. Chivalry had not blossomed into respect for womanhood, and\r\nthey had probably been left behind by their lords in the march of\r\ncivilization. The female names from time to time cast up in the surging\r\ntide of affairs seldom appear except for disgrace or misfortune, so that\r\nwe come to the conclusion that womanhood in the Frank empire was seldom\r\nhappy or honourable except in the cloister. Thus, no traditional names\r\nof woman came down with the Paladins; and when love became an essential\r\npart of the machinery of the Italian poets, they had to invent, and\r\nentitle, the heroines for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Charles._\r\n\r\nMost heroes gain by becoming the subjects of romance, but this has been\r\nby no means the case with the great Karl of the Franks, for though ‘il\r\nRè Carlo’ be three rolled into one, he has lost the heroism of him of\r\nthe hammer, and the large-minded statesmanship of the first emperor,\r\nobtaining instead the dulness and weak credulity of him who was called\r\nthe Bald.\r\n\r\nThe three Charleses are matter of history, and the Carlo Magno of\r\nromance and ballad is little more than a lay figure, always persuaded to\r\nbelieve traitorous stories of his best friends, and meeting with\r\nundignified adventures, as in the case of the enchanted ring that bound\r\nhis affections to lady, bishop, and lake. We therefore pass on at once\r\nto this name, which a foolish old story thus accounts for. As an infant\r\nhe was put out to nurse, and when brought home, much grown, his mother\r\nexclaimed, ‘What great carle is this?’ whence he continued to be so\r\ncalled, instead of by his baptismal name of David. This tale may have\r\nbeen suggested by the fact, that the veritable Charles the Great, when\r\nlaying aside his state he became a scholar in his palace hall, under the\r\nteaching of the English Alcuin, assumed the appropriate title of David.\r\n\r\nKarl was in fact, as we have shown in the chapter on ancestral names,\r\nthe regular family name of the line, used in regular alternation from\r\nits first appearance with the grandfather of the hammering Charles, who\r\nperhaps took his soubriquet from Thor, and gradually acquiring more and\r\nmore ignominious epithets till it sunk into obscurity in Lorraine,\r\nwhence it only emerged again when the Karlings intermarried with\r\nPhilippe Auguste, and brought the old imperial name into the French\r\nroyal family, where five more kings bore it. They sent it to Naples with\r\nCharles of Anjou; and his son, Charles Robert, or Caroberto, being\r\nelected to Hungary, had so many namesakes that Camden was led to suppose\r\nthat all Hungarian kings were called Carl. It went to Germany when the\r\nson of the blind king of Bohemia received it from his father’s\r\nconnection with the French court, and afterwards reigned as the 4th Karl\r\nof Germany, taking up his reckoning from the old Karlingen. Again, the\r\nsecond ducal house of Burgundy was an off-shoot from the line of Valois,\r\nand it was from Charles the Bold that the name was transmitted to his\r\ngreat grandson of Ghent, soon known to Europe as Carlos I. of Spain,\r\nKarl V. of Germany, Carolus Quintus of the Holy Roman Empire. He was the\r\nreal name spreader from whom this became national in Spain, Denmark, and\r\neven in Britain, for his renown impressed James I. with the idea that\r\nthis must be a fortunate name; when, in the hope of averting the unhappy\r\ndoom that had pursued five James Stuarts in succession, he called his\r\nsons Henry and Charles. The destiny of the Stuart was not averted, but\r\nthe fate of the ‘royal martyr’ made Charles the most popular of all\r\nappellations among the loyalists, and afterwards with the Jacobites, in\r\nboth England and Scotland, so that rare as it formerly was, it now\r\ndisputes the ground with John, George, and William, as the most common\r\nof English names.\r\n\r\nAnother namesake of Charlemagne must not be forgotten, namely, the son\r\nof St. Olaf, of Norway, whom his followers, intending an agreeable\r\nsurprise to the father, baptized after the great emperor by the name of\r\nMagnus, whence the very frequent Magnus, of Scandinavia, and Manus of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Keltic.    │    French.    │Span. and Port.│\r\n   │Charles        │     GAEL.     │Charles        │Carlos         │\r\n   │Charlie        │Tearlach       │Charlot        │    German.    │\r\n   │               │     ERSE.     │               │Karl           │\r\n   │               │Searlus        │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Italian.    │   Swedish.    │    Danish.    │    Dutch.     │\r\n   │Carlo          │Karl           │Karl           │Carolus        │\r\n   │Carolo         │Kalle          │Karel          │Carel          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Karel          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │   Illyrian.   │   Lusatian.   │\r\n   │Karol          │Karel          │Karlo          │Karlo          │\r\n   │Karolek        │   —————————   │Karlica        │Karlko         │\r\n   │               │    Slovak.    │Karlic         │               │\r\n   │               │Karol          │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │Lettish.       │  Esthonian.   │  Hungarian.   │   Dantzig.    │\r\n   │Karls          │Karl           │Karoly         │Kasch          │\r\n   │               │Karel          │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe two feminines are of late invention. The first I have been able to\r\nfind was Carlota or Charlotte, of Savoy, who married Louis XI., and thus\r\nintroduced this form to French royalty. Charlotte d'Albret had the\r\nmisfortune to be given in marriage to Cesare Borgia, and had one\r\ndaughter, who married into the house of La Tremouille, whence the brave\r\nLady Derby carried it into England, and our registers of the seventeenth\r\ncentury first acknowledge Charlet. The Huguenotism of the house of La\r\nTremouille connected it with that of Bouillon, where the heiress Carola,\r\nor Charlotte, was married in 1588. The house of Orange probably thence\r\nderived it, and it became known in Germany, whence it was brought to us\r\nin full popularity by the good queen of George III. A sentimental fame\r\nwas also bestowed on it, as the name of Göthe’s heroine in _Werther_.\r\n\r\nCarolina, the other form, seems to have been at first Italian, and\r\nthence to have spread to Southern Germany, and all over that country,\r\nwhence we received it with the wife of George II., by whom it was much\r\nspread among the nobility, and is now very common among the peasantry.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │    Italian    │\r\n   │Charlotte      │Charlotte      │Carlota        │Carlotta       │\r\n   │Lotty          │Lolotte        │Lola           │Carlota        │\r\n   │Chatty         │Caroline       │               │Carolina       │\r\n   │Caroline       │               │               │               │\r\n   │Carry          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Swedish.    │    Slovak.    │   Lettish.    │\r\n   │Charlotte      │Lotta          │Karolina       │Latte          │\r\n   │Lottchen       │               │Karolinka      │   —————————   │\r\n   │Caroline       │               │Karla          │   Dantzig.    │\r\n   │Lina           │               │               │Linuschca      │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nCeorl was the name of an early king of Mercia, and of a thane of\r\nAlfred’s, who defeated the Danes, and Carloman was almost as common as\r\nCarl in the old Karling family.[139]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  Sismondi; Roscoe; Michaelis; Pott; Anderson, _Genealogies_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION III.—_Roland, &c._\r\n\r\nWhen the army of Charles the Great was marching back from Spain, the\r\nGascons, Navarrese, and Goths, who were afraid of being swallowed up by\r\nhis empire, if they exchanged his protection for that of the Arabs,\r\nplotted together, fell on the rear of his columns as they were passing\r\nthrough the defile of Roncesvalles, close to the little town of Fuente\r\nArabia, and slaughtered the whole division that were guarding the\r\nbaggage. ‘There was slain Rotlandus, prefect of the Armorican border.’\r\n\r\nSo says Eginhard, the contemporary chronicler, and as he mentions only\r\ntwo other nobles as having been killed, it is natural to conclude that\r\nthis Rotlandus was a man of mark. Who was he? Certainly Warden of the\r\nMarches of Brittany, but was he a Frank Hruodland (the country’s glory),\r\nthe repressor of the Kelts, or was he a Breton in the Frankish service?\r\nThe Cymry have laid claim to him; they say that the rolling word is\r\nintended to render Tallwch, a rolling or overwhelming torrent, the name\r\nof the father of Tristrem; and in the later romances, this knight has\r\nactually been turned into Rowland, which thus has become a favourite\r\nnational Welsh name.\r\n\r\nIt is far more likely that ‘Rotlandus’ was Frank, but the next question\r\nis, what were the deeds that made his birth worth contending for, and\r\nthe war song of Rou be the chant of the gallant minstrel Taillefer, to\r\ncheer the Normans on to their victory at Hastings?\r\n\r\nEginhard is utterly silent. Turpin tells us that Rolandus was the\r\nemperor’s nephew, the son of his sister Bertha, and of Milo de Anglars.\r\nWith Turpin, the expedition to Spain is the prominent feature of the\r\nreign, and he gives us an account of a mingled battle and controversy\r\nbetween Roland and Ferragus, a giant of the race of Goliath, and only\r\nvulnerable in one point, where, however, Roland managed to pierce him.\r\nVery soon after follows the ambush of Roncesvalles, the enemy being\r\nSaracens, not Christians, but conducted by the traitor Ganelon. After a\r\nterrible battle, Roland, sorely wounded, lay down under a tree, and\r\napostrophizing his good sword Durenda, in the most tender manner, thrice\r\nstruck it upon a block of marble, and shattered it in twain, lest it\r\nshould fall into the Saracen hands. Then he blew upon his horn, which\r\nhad such wondrous tones that all other horns split at the sound, and\r\nthis blast was with such effort that he burst all the veins in his neck,\r\nand the sound reached the king, eight miles off! He then commended his\r\nsoul to heaven, and made a most pious and beautiful end.\r\n\r\nThat block of marble is magnified by popular fame into the mountain\r\nitself, and la Brèche de Roland is supposed to be the cleft made by his\r\nsword! The Northern Lights, too, are said to be King Charles riding by,\r\nand Roland bearing the banner. The Spaniards, so far as they were\r\nChristians and Teutons, felt with the Franks; so far as they were\r\nCeltiberians, against them, and the result was a collection of admirable\r\npopular ballads, all prime authorities with Don Quixote, in which _il\r\nrey Carlos_ and his peers are treated as national heroes. Nevertheless\r\nthey are proud of his defeat at Roncesvalles, declare that the emperor\r\nbroke his word to Don Alfonso of Leon, and that the attack was therefore\r\nmade in which Don Alfonso’s nephew, Bernardo de Carpio, was leader, and\r\ndemolished the invulnerable Conde Roldan, by squeezing him to death in\r\nhis arms.\r\n\r\nIt is the Spaniards alone who have transferred to Roldan the\r\ninvulnerability of Achilles, Siegfried, and Diarmaid; the French and\r\nItalians bestow it only on Ferragus, who is, as already mentioned, an\r\nevident Keltic importation through the Breton poets, being either the\r\nIrish Fergus, or the Welsh Vreichfras, though he has since become a\r\nMoorish giant.\r\n\r\nThe English, having their own Arthur to engage their attention, did\r\nlittle more than versify Turpin, but allowed Roland’s sword to be\r\ncarried away by his friend Sir Baldwin, and took vengeance for his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut it was the Italians who did the most for their Orlando. Some\r\nfloating Valkyr notion had attached itself in German fancy to his\r\nmother, who was at first Bertha the goose-footed, and then the\r\nlarge-footed, and romance further related that she was the emperor’s\r\nsister, who had secretly married the knight Milone di Anglante, and\r\ntherefore was driven out of the court, and forced to take refuge in a\r\ncave, where the hero was born, and was called Rotolando, from his\r\nrolling himself on the ground. His father went to the wars, and Berta\r\nbecame the diligent spinner before alluded to, but she was still so poor\r\nthat his young companions each gave her boy a square of cloth to cover\r\nhim, two white, and two red, whence he always bore those colours\r\nquartered on his shield. Afterwards he was taken into favour, and became\r\nthe chief Paladin.\r\n\r\nHere Luigi Pulci took him up, and made him the hero of a poem called the\r\n_Morgante Maggiore_, from a giant whom Orlando converted, and who\r\nfollowed him faithfully about through all his adventures. Orlando is\r\nhere a high-spirited Christian knight, brave, pious, and faithfully\r\nattached to his wife Alda. When slain at Roncesvalles, he mentions her\r\nin his last and very beautiful prayer, and his sorrow for his comrades,\r\nand parting with his horse and sword, are very touching.\r\n\r\nIt was Bojardo who deprived Orlando of his old traditional character of\r\nthe high-minded champion, that crusading days had dwelt upon. Led,\r\nperhaps, by the idea of the frenzy of Amadis de Gaul, he made Orlando\r\nfall desperately in love with the fair and false Angelica, princess of\r\nCatay, and leave the court and all his duties just as the Saracen king\r\nGradasso was invading France, to obtain possession of Durindana,\r\nOrlando’s sword. The action of the poem is taken up with the adventures\r\nimposed upon Orlando by the mischievous beauty, and the pursuit of him\r\nby the other Paladins, and finally it leaves off with the whole chivalry\r\nof Charlemagne besieged in Paris by the Saracens.\r\n\r\nOrlando was only _innamorato_ according to Bojardo; Ariosto took him up\r\nand made him _furioso_. Continuing the poem where it had dropped from\r\nBojardo’s hands, Ariosto made Angelica fall in love with an obscure\r\nyouth, and marry him, whereupon Orlando, after the example of Amadis de\r\nGaul, went into the state of frenzy that Don Quixote tried to imitate;\r\nand the Christians suffered as much as the Greeks did without Achilles,\r\ntill the champion’s senses were brought back from the moon; when he\r\nreturned to his duty, restored fortune to the Christians, and saved\r\nFrance from becoming tributary to the infidel.\r\n\r\nCharles VIII. of France, in his romantic youth, named one of his\r\nshort-lived children, Charles Roland, by the way of union of the two\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │English.       │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Roland         │Roland         │Orlando        │Roldan         │\r\n   │Rowland        │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │Portuguese.    │    German.    │ Netherlands.  │               │\r\n   │Rolando        │Roland         │Roeland        │               │\r\n   │Roldao         │Ruland         │               │               │\r\n   │               │Rudland        │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the first syllable is the word _hruod_ in Frank,\r\n_hrothr_ in the North, and in modern German _ruhm_, meaning fame or\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n_Hruod_ is a most prolific word. As Hruodgar, famous spear, it figures\r\nin the _Nibelungenlied_, where the Markgraf Rudiger is the special\r\nfriend of Dietrich, and for a long time, like him, refrains from the\r\nfray, though at last he plunges into it and is killed.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a veritable Hruodgar living in the time of\r\nPepin, who married a lady whose father’s name was Hector, whence it was\r\ntaken for granted that she descended from Hector of Troy. Therefore the\r\nHouse of Este bore the white eagle in their coat of arms, because it was\r\nsaid he of Troy had a shield azure with a silver eagle! Roger, Olivier,\r\nand Roland are mentioned together as subjects of minstrel songs. In the\r\nold romances there is a Ruggieri de Risa, or Reggio, who marries an\r\nAmazon, called Galaciella, but is soon after murdered, and she is\r\ncarried off by sea by her enemies, whom, however, she manages to\r\noverpower and destroy on the voyage, but only to be driven to a desert\r\nisland, where she dies at the birth of her twins, Ruggiero and Marfisa.\r\nThis Ruggiero is the prime favourite of the Italian poets. Bojardo tells\r\nhow he was bred up on lion’s marrow by the enchanter Atlante, in Africa,\r\nand when his education was finished, was sent to France with the\r\nwonderful hippogriff, or winged horse. And Ariosto, probably in\r\ncompliment to the House of Este, made his adventures the main plot of\r\nthe _Orlando Furioso_, and completed it by converting him to\r\nChristianity, and marrying him to the brave and amiable Amazon,\r\nBradamante.\r\n\r\nBojardo probably adopted Ruggiero because his country was Reggio, a\r\ncountry with which the name had become connected, when Roger de\r\nHauteville had founded the kingdom of Sicily, and Ruggero, the son of\r\nhis elder brother, Robert Guiscard, had been count of Apulia. These were\r\nboth, of course, direct from the northern Hruodgeir, as was the\r\nturbulent Roger de Montgomery, who gave so much trouble in Normandy. It\r\nwas once a famous knightly name, but is now too much discarded. Roger\r\nmust once have been very frequent in England, since Hodge is still\r\nproverbial for a rustic,—whereas as a rule he is never so called, though\r\nthe Registrar-General noted an extraordinary number of Roger Tichbornes\r\nin the year of the claimant’s trial!\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Spanish.  │  German.   │\r\n   │Roger       │Roger       │Ruggiero    │Rogerio     │Rüdiger     │\r\n   │Hodge       │            │Rogero      │            │Roger       │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │    Nor.    │Netherlands.│  Russian.  │  Polish.   │  Lettish.  │\r\n   │Hrodgjer    │Rogier      │Rozer       │Rydygier    │Rekkerts    │\r\n   │Raadgjer    │Rutger      │            │            │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nHrothgar was also a famed name among the Angles. It appears in Beowulf,\r\nas the chief of the Scyldings, the son of Healfdane. There, too, are\r\nfound Hrothmund and Hrothwulf; and the northern names of Hroar and\r\nHrolfr are contractions of these, though the characters they belong to\r\nare not the same as those in Beowulf. Hrolf Krake was the subject of a\r\nnorthern Saga; and the father of our Norman kings, whom we are wont to\r\ncall by his Latinism of Rollo, formed from the French stammer of Rou,\r\nwas in fact Hrolf Gangr, or at full length, Hrothulf, Fame-Wolf. A name\r\nof fame and terror it was, when the mighty man, too weighty for steed to\r\ncarry him, was expelled from his own land, and fought for a home, not\r\nfor plunder, among the fertile orchards of Neustria, when his followers'\r\nrude homage overthrew the degenerate Karling, and ‘the grisly old\r\nproselyte,’ in his baptism, assumed, without perhaps knowing of the\r\nsimilarity, the French Robert. This change prevented his original name\r\nfrom being very prevalent among the Normans; and the German form,\r\nRudolf, is chiefly from a sainted Karling prince, who was bishop of\r\nBourges, and from whom Rudolf of Hapsburg must have derived it. From him\r\nit became imperial, and other countries received it, without knowing it\r\nfor their old friend.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Rodolph        │Rodolphe       │Rodulfo        │Rodolfo        │\r\n   │Rolf           │Raoul          │   —————————   │Ridolfo        │\r\n   │               │Roul           │  Portuguese.  │               │\r\n   │               │Rou            │Rodolpho       │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │   Frisian.    │    Swiss.     │\r\n   │Rudolf         │Ruedolf        │Rulef          │Ruedi          │\r\n   │               │               │Rulves         │Ruedeli        │\r\n   │               │               │Rotholf        │Rudi           │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n   │   Swedish.    │     Nor.      │   Lettish.    │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Rudolf         │Hruodulf       │Rohlops        │Rudolf         │\r\n   │Rolf           │Hrolfr         │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nRobert, the name assumed by Rolf Gauge at his baptism was Frank, rather\r\nthan Northern, inasmuch as _bjart_ is an uncommon conclusion among his\r\nnative race. Hruadperaht, or bright fame, was the original form, the\r\nproperty of a bishop, who somewhere about the year 700 founded the first\r\nChristian church at Wurms. Honoured alike in France and Germany, he\r\nbecame Ruprecht in the latter, and Robert in the former. Like St.\r\nNicolas, he is in Germany supposed to exercise a secret supervision over\r\nchildren; in some places _Knecht Ruprecht_ dispenses Christmas gifts,\r\nbut he more often keeps watch over naughty children, and thus answers to\r\nthe English Robin Goodfellow, or Hob Goblin. _Red_ was long supposed to\r\nbe the origin of the name, which some made Redbert, or bright speech,\r\nothers Redbeard! The German form, however, disproves both of these, and\r\nRuprecht continued in honour in its own country, naming in especial that\r\nwise Pfalzgraf of the Rhine, who in 346 founded the university of\r\nHeidelberg; and on the deposition of the crazy Bohemian Kaisar Wenzel,\r\nwas elected Emperor of Germany, and reigned for nine years with great\r\nsuccess and glory. It was after him that the infant, born at Prague,\r\nduring the brief greatness of the Winter King, received that name of\r\nRupert, which was so terrible to the Roundheads, but which for the most\r\npart they translated by their native Robert—native, because thoroughly\r\nAnglicized, for it was of French growth, had belonged to two or three\r\nsaints, and to the hymn-writing and much persecuted king called the\r\npious, the second of the Capet or Parisian dynasty; but after the son of\r\nSt. Louis carried it off to the House of Bourbon, it scantily appeared\r\namong the royal family. Normandy, however, cultivated it after it had\r\nbeen chosen at the baptism of her first duke, and sent it to Apulia with\r\nthe astute Robert Guiscard, whence Roberto became national in the\r\nNeapolitan realms, and was adopted by the Angevin line, among others by\r\nthe king who patronized Petrarch. The next Duke of Normandy who bore it\r\nwas that wild pilgrim, whose soubriquet varies between the Devil and the\r\nMagnificent. The disinheritance of his equally wild, but more\r\nunfortunate grandson, Robert Courthose, diverted it from the English\r\nthrone, but a flood of knights and nobles had poured in and established\r\nit so completely, that in a few generations more Hob was one of the\r\nestablished peasant names in England. Robin was its more gracious\r\ncontraction—let our dearly beloved archer be who he will—either as\r\nballad tells, the outlawed Earl of Huntingdon, or as late critics would\r\nhave us believe, only another manifestation of Robin Goodfellow, or of\r\nthe wild huntsman. Robin was the epithet by which Queen Elizabeth was\r\nwont to address the two earls, step-father and stepson, who so long\r\nsunned themselves in her favour; and though it has now acquired a homely\r\nsound, and the popularity of the full name has somewhat waned, it is\r\nstill frequent. To Scotland it was brought by the Anglo-Norman barons,\r\nand when the English Bruces had made their distant drop of Royal\r\nScottish blood float them to the throne, Robert the Bruce became a\r\npassionately beloved national hero, and his name one of the most\r\nfavoured in the Lowlands. In Ireland it is called Roibin, a gentleman\r\ncalled in English Robin Lawless being in Irish, Roibin Laighleis.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Scotch.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Robert         │Robert         │Robert         │Roberto        │\r\n   │Robin          │Robin          │Robers         │Ruberto        │\r\n   │Hob            │Robbie         │Robi           │Ruperto        │\r\n   │Bob            │Rab            │Robinet        │               │\r\n   │Rupert         │               │Rupert         │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n   │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │    Slovak.    │   Lusatian.   │\r\n   │Hruodebert     │Ruprecht       │Ruprat         │Huprecht       │\r\n   │Ruprecht       │Prechtl        │               │               │\r\n   │Rupert         │               │               │               │\r\n   │Rudbert        │               │               │               │\r\n   │Robert         │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nNot behindhand in glory is the northern Hrothrekr, or Germanic\r\nHruoderich, famous ruler. In Gothic Spain, it was indeed Rodrigo, who\r\nlost his country to the Moors, but became in his people’s minds the\r\ncentre for pity as much as for blame, and the subject of the beautiful\r\nlegends that Southey has embodied in the finest of his poems. And it was\r\nRodrigo Diaz de Bivar,‘Ruy mi Cid Campeador,’ in whom ballad lore\r\ndelighted. This became one of the most frequent of all the\r\ngrand-sounding names prefaced by Don, and Rodriguez and Ruiz to be very\r\ncommon surnames.\r\n\r\nThe northern Hrothrekr was not long in being shortened to Hrorekr, and\r\nthence came the name of that Norseman, who, according to Russian\r\nhistorians, was invited by the Slaves to be their protector, and founded\r\nthe Norman dynasty of Ruric, which continued on the throne during the\r\ntroubled days of Tatar supremacy. Roric and Godwald were the first\r\nNorthmen to obtain fiefs in France. In Wales, Scotland, and Ireland,\r\nRoderick has a sort of false honour, being adopted as the equivalent of\r\nthe native Keltic names, the Welsh Rhydderc, and the Gadhaelic Ruadh;\r\nfor Roy and Rorie, though rightly and traditionally so called by their\r\nfriends, would now all make Teutons of themselves, and use the signature\r\nof Roderick.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Roderick       │Rodrigue       │Rodrigo        │Rodrigo        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │     Nor.      │   Russian.    │               │\r\n   │Roderich       │Rothrekr       │Rurik          │               │\r\n   │               │Hrorek         │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other forms from this prolific source.

King Ordoño of Gallicia married, about the year 910, a\r\nlady recorded as Radegonda, or Arragonda, or Urraca, so that the\r\nperplexing Urraca may possibly be a contraction of this name. In the\r\nSpanish vernacular a magpie is called _urraca_, but probably from the\r\nlikeness of the word to the note of the bird.\r\n\r\nRadegist or Radelchis, and Radegar, were princes of Beneventum. Radbad,\r\nthe Frisian Rabbo, and Radbert, seem to be Old German forms, but it is a\r\nword liable to be confused with _hramn_, and with _rand_, and though a\r\ncommon masculine termination in England, in the North it is only a\r\ncorruption of _fred_, peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION IV.—_Renaud._\r\n\r\nTo the French, Renaud de Montauban was a far more popular and national\r\nhero than even Roland.\r\n\r\nHis name, Raginwald, was common among the Franks, and his origin is\r\nsuspected to be an Aquitanian Rainaldus, who in 843 was killed in\r\nfighting with the Bretons, when in the miserable days of Charles the\r\nBald, they invaded France under Nominoë, and were joined by the\r\ntraitorous Count Lambert.\r\n\r\nCharles the Bald, as has been said, seems to have sat for the picture of\r\nhis grandfather, the Bretons turned into the Saracens, Count Lambert’s\r\ntreachery went to swell the account of Gano, and Rinaldus could fall at\r\nRoncevaux quite as well as at Mans!\r\n\r\nHe is just mentioned by Turpin as among the knights who accompanied\r\nCharlemagne, and were killed at Roncesvalles; and the Spanish ballads\r\ndwelt much upon the exploits of Don Reynaldos; indeed it appears that he\r\nenjoyed Don Quixote’s special admiration for having carried off, in\r\nspite of forty Moors, a golden image of Mahomet, which he wanted to melt\r\nup for the payment of his men!\r\n\r\nSuch an exploit was decidedly in the line of the French hero Renaud, or\r\nRegnault, who is in romance a sort of prince of freebooters. He and his\r\nthree brothers go by the title of the Quatre Fils Aymon, and he is a\r\nsort of chivalrous Robin Hood to the French mind, insomuch that country\r\ninns may still be found with the sign of the _Quatre Fils Aymon_. In the\r\nold French tale, the outlawry of Renaud is accounted for by his having\r\nbeen insulted by the emperor’s nephew Berthelot, while playing at chess,\r\nand replying with a blow of the golden board that struck out the\r\noffender’s brains. He and his brothers then were banished, lived a\r\nfreebooting life, built the castle of Montalban in Gascony, the king of\r\nwhich country bestowed on him in marriage his daughter Clarice, and\r\nfinally went on pilgrimage, made his peace with the emperor, turned his\r\nhand to the building of Cologne Cathedral, and was killed there by his\r\njealous fellow-workmen.\r\n\r\nIn Italy Rinaldo became a wild, high-spirited Paladin, always fighting\r\nand falling in love, and retaining little in common with his French\r\noriginal, except the possession of his matchless horse Bayard, or\r\nBajardo, which fought as well as his master, and on his loss ran wild in\r\nthe woods. In the _Morgante_, Rinaldo mistrusts Gano, and avoids the\r\nambush of Roncesvalles, but is afterwards carried with his brother\r\nRicciardetto by two devils, to revenge the slaughter, which they do most\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nIn the _Orlando Innamorato_, Rinaldo is at first ensnared by Angelica’s\r\nbeauty, but is cured by drinking unwittingly of the fountain of hate,\r\nwhile she drank of the fountain of love, and was enamoured of him. He is\r\ncarried off by Malagigi to an enchanted island of delight, but returns\r\nduring the great siege of Paris, takes a counter-draught of the fountain\r\nof love, fights in single combat with Ferrau, but is interrupted by\r\nBajardo straying into a wood, whither he pursues the animal, and is\r\nthere deserted by Boiardo, to be taken up by Ariosto, and after many\r\nadventures brought to relieve the Christian army in the utmost danger,\r\nand to give his sister Bradamante in marriage to Ruggiero.\r\n\r\nSome have thought that Tasso’s one fictitious hero, Rinaldo, was partly\r\nborrowed from the Paladin, going as he does to the enchanted gardens of\r\nArmida, and being only brought back when the crusading host was in the\r\nutmost jeopardy. The chief mission of this latter Rinaldo was, however,\r\nit may be suspected, to be a compliment to the House of Este.\r\n\r\nSome even think Roland himself only another version of Ragenwald, but\r\nthe one Paladin is undoubtedly traceable to Hruoland, as is the other to\r\nRagenwald, though I am inclined to think that the Rolandsaulen, that\r\naccompany the Irminsaulen at the gates of old cities, may perhaps be\r\nrightly from Raginwald, judgment-power.\r\n\r\nThe Normans received this name from two sources, the French Regnault or\r\nRenaud, generally from the Paladin, and from their own northern Ragnwold\r\nor Rognwald. So Domesday has it in various forms, as Ragenald, Reynald,\r\nand Rainald, the latter fourteen times after the Conquest; and amongst\r\nthem all we have derived our Christian name of Reginald, and the surname\r\nof Reynolds. The Scots took their form from the northern Rognvald,\r\nbelonging to a great Jarl of the Orkneys, a noted skald, and thus\r\nobtained Ronald, which is in Gaelic Raonmill.\r\n\r\n_Ragn_, or judgment, the leading word in this class of names, is\r\nconnected with the Latin _rego_, to rule, and as _rectus_ sprang from\r\nthe one, so the Gothic _raihts_ and our _right_ arose from the Teutonic\r\nforms, as well as to _wreak_, and the German _rache_, vengeance, both\r\nfrom the old idea of justice. _Ragn_, though primarily meaning justice,\r\nis also used, as judgment is, in the sense of wisdom. Reginald Pole was\r\nin his own time known as Reynold. We get the longer name from his\r\nLatinism as Reginaldus.\r\n\r\nSome of Renaud’s freebooting fame may have come from a person whose name\r\nso closely resembles his own, that it is by no means easy to distinguish\r\ntheir progeny; namely, Raginhard, or firm judge. A nobleman of this name\r\nwas Count of the Palace, or Pfalzgraf, to Louis de Debonnaire, and\r\nengaged in a conspiracy against him, with Bernard, king of Italy. They\r\nwere made prisoners, and condemned; the emperor commuted the sentence to\r\nthe loss of their sight; but his wife, who wanted Bernard’s inheritance,\r\ntook care that so savage a person was sent to perform the operation that\r\nthey both died in consequence.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │   Scottish.   │    Gaelic.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Reginald       │Ronald         │Raonmill       │Rinaldo        │\r\n   │Reynold        │Ranald         │               │               │\r\n   │Rex            │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Spanish.    │    French.    │    German.    │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Reynaldos      │Regnauld       │Reinwald       │Raynold        │\r\n   │               │Renaud         │Reinald        │               │\r\n   │               │Regnault       │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Esthonian.   │   Lettish.    │   Frisian.    │               │\r\n   │Rein           │Reinis         │Reinold        │               │\r\n   │Reino          │               │Rennold        │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nAnother Reginard is said by Le Grand to have been a cunning politician,\r\nwho lived in Austrasia in the ninth century, and much troubled his lord\r\nby sometimes taking part with the Germans, sometimes with the French, by\r\nwhich means he became so much detested that he was the subject of many\r\nsongs in which he was called the Little Fox. At any rate, in the great\r\nanimal epic, the fox has taken the name of Reinart, or Reinecke Fuchs,\r\nand as early as 1313, when the sons of the wily Philippe le Bel were\r\nknighted, the edifying spectacle was represented before them of the life\r\nof Renard the Fox, who became successively physician, clerk, bishop,\r\narchbishop, and pope, eating however hens and chickens all the while,\r\nmuch after the fashion of their father’s unhappy tool at Avignon.

Once we\r\nhad it peacefully in East Anglia, as Raginhere, the warrior of judgment,\r\nbut in that same East Anglia it was to have a deadly fame. The\r\nhistorical Ragnar seems to have been decorated with a few mythical\r\nexploits of some more ancient hero, for he is one of the dragon killers.\r\nHis first wife, Thyra, had her bower encircled by a deadly poisonous\r\nserpent, the ravager of the whole country, until he won her hand by the\r\nslaughter of the serpent, having guarded himself from its venom by a\r\nsuit of hairy garments covered with pitch, whence he obtained the\r\nsoubriquet of Lodbrog. Afterwards he married a poor but beautiful maiden\r\ncalled Krake, who, after she had borne him four sons, disclosed that she\r\nwas the last of the Wolsungen, the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild. Nay,\r\nIcelandic families connect themselves through her with the heroes of\r\nWurms! And after this it is strange to find Jarl Ragnar sailing up the\r\nSeine, and ravaging Paris, in the days of Charles the Bald, being in\r\nfact the Agramante of the poets. Again he was the cause of bitter woe to\r\nEngland, falling into the hands of King Ælle of Northumbria, and being\r\nput to death by being thrown into a pit filled with vipers, where, till\r\nhis last breath, he chanted the grand death song that is worthy to stand\r\nbeside the dirge of King Eric Blödaxe. It was revenge for his death that\r\nbrought his fierce sons with that dire armament which ravaged\r\nEngland—the invasion that was fatal to Edmund of East Anglia, ruined the\r\ngreat abbeys of the fens, and though finally mastered by Alfred, made\r\nthe North of England Danish. This name of dread was brought to Normandy\r\nby his kindred, and figures in Domesday as Raynar, a frequent surname in\r\nEngland. In France it was cut down to René, a name that crept into the\r\nHouse of Anjou, and was bestowed on the prince—too much of a troubadour\r\nand knight-errant for a king—who vainly tried on so many crowns, and was\r\nhated in England because ‘Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.’\r\nWhy the feminine of this name, Renée, was chosen for the younger\r\ndaughter of Louis XII., does not appear, but when she married into the\r\nHouse of Este, it was translated into Renata, and the Italians, in their\r\nrevived classicalism, seem to have fancied it had some connection with\r\nregeneration. Renira is the Dutch feminine form.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Provençal.   │    German.    │\r\n   │Rayner         │Reignier       │Raynier        │Reiner         │\r\n   │Rainer         │Renier         │   ————————    │   ————————    │\r\n   │               │René           │   Italian.    │     Nor.      │\r\n   │               │               │Renato         │Ragnar         │\r\n   │               │               │Ranieri        │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nRaginmar, great judgment, still exists in Germany, as Reinmar, or\r\nReimar, and is the most probable origin of the Ramiro, so frequent among\r\nthe early kings of the small struggling Pyrenean realms.\r\n\r\nRagnhild, a favourite with old Norwegian dames, has become in Lapp,\r\nRanna.\r\n\r\nThe German contraction _rein_ has been often translated into pure, but\r\nthis is an error, as these names can almost uniformly be traced back to\r\n_ragn_.\r\n\r\nThe remaining forms are—\r\n\r\n    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n    │    German.

He is not a very interesting\r\npersonage, being rather the attendant knight than the prime hero, the\r\nrescued, not the rescuer; but under his Italian name of Ricciardetto, he\r\nhas a whole poem to himself, a mere scurrilous satire upon friars, and\r\nwas the lowest depth to which romantic poetry fell.\r\n\r\nIt was not to this Paladin that his name owed its frequency, but to\r\nRicehard, or stern king, an Anglo-Saxon monarch of Kent, who left his\r\nthrone to become a monk at Lucca, and was there said to have wrought\r\nmany miracles. The third Norman duke bore the name, and transmitted it\r\nto two successors, whence we obtained as many as twenty Richards at the\r\nConquest, and have used it as a favourite national name ever since. Two\r\nmore saints bore it, the excellent bishop of Chichester, and a hermit,\r\nwho was made bishop of Andria, in Apulia. Three times has it been on the\r\nthrone, though finally discarded by royalty after the enormities imputed\r\nto the last Plantagenet; and latterly it has lost a little of its\r\npopularity, though it has never been entirely disused.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │ Netherlands.  │\r\n   │Richard        │Richard        │Riccardo       │Rijkert        │\r\n   │Ritchie        │  ———————————  │Ricciardo      │Riikard        │\r\n   │   (_Scot._)   │  Portuguese.  │Ricciardetto   │Riik           │\r\n   │Diccon         │Ricardo        │               │               │\r\n   │Dick           │  ———————————  │               │               │\r\n   │               │    Polish.    │               │               │\r\n   │               │Ryszard        │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe leading syllable is from the same source as _ragn_; it is he who\r\nexecutes judgment, the ruler or king, the same word as the Indian\r\n_rajah_, and the Latin _rex_. It was _reiks_ in Gothic, _rich_ in old\r\nGerman, _ryce_ in Anglo-Saxon; and its derivative _reich_ was the origin\r\nof the Neustria and Austrasia, the _oster reich_ and _ne oster reich_,\r\neastern and not eastern, realms, of the Franks, and of the present\r\nAustria or eastern kingdom. _Reich_ is the home term for the German\r\nempire at the present day. Our adjective _rich_ is its sordid offspring,\r\nand in France a wealthy peasant is _un richart_.\r\n\r\n_Rik_ is more in vogue as a Gothic and Frank commencement than among\r\nmost of the other Teutons, though all use it as a conclusion. Richard is\r\nits only universal name; but among the first foes of the Romans, we find\r\namong the Suevi, Rechiarius, who is the same with the German Richer, or\r\nkingly warrior, and the French saint, Riquier. Ricimar, the name of the\r\nterrible Goth who for a short time held Rome, is the great king, and was\r\nthe maker and dethroner of the four last Augusti; and his namesakes,\r\nRicimer and Rechimiro, appear in Spain, and may, perhaps, be the right\r\nsource of Ramiro. Recared, Richila, Riciburga, are also Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe Franks show Rigonthe, or royal war, a daughter of Fredegonda;\r\nRictrude, a saint, as well as Richilde, also a queenly name, which\r\ncontinued for some time in use, and is better than the Richenza and\r\nRicharda, sometimes used in England as the feminines of Richard. Richolf\r\nendures in Friesland as Rycolf, Ryklof, or Rickel, and Germany once had\r\nRicbert.\r\n\r\nOne great name of this derivation is the northern Eirik. The first\r\nsyllable is that which we call _aye_ to the present day, the word that\r\nlies at the root of the Latin _œvum_, the German _ewig_, and our own\r\n_ever_. Ei-rik is thus _Ever King_. An ancient Erik was said to have\r\nbeen admitted among the gods, and Earic was the second name of Æsc, the\r\nson of Henghist; but it was the northern people who really used Eirik,\r\nwhich comes over and over in the line of succession of all the Northern\r\nsovereignties, figures in their ballads, and, in the person of King\r\nEirik Blödaxe, is connected with their finest poetry. In the present day\r\nit is scarcely less popular than in old times, and has the feminine\r\nEirika.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  German.   │    Nor.    │  Swedish.  │\r\n   │Eric        │Eric        │Erich       │Eirik       │Erik        │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Polish.   │  Slovak.   │  Lettish.  │   Esth.    │   Lapp.    │\r\n   │Eryk        │Erih        │Erik        │Erik        │Keira       │\r\n   │            │Areh        │            │Eers        │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nTwo other names of the North have the same commencement, Eimund, ever\r\nprotecting, or eternal guard, commonly called Emund, and Eilif, the\r\never-living, answering to the Greek Ambrosios. Eilif is also written\r\nEiliv, Elliv, Ellef, and even Elof, and Latinized in Elavus.[141]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  Roscoe; Munch; Butler; Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VI.—_Astolfo._\r\n\r\nAstolfo is to the Paladins what Conan is to the Feen, the butt or\r\n_grazioso_. In his full-blown perfection he is first cousin to Orlando,\r\nbeing the son of Milone’s brother Ottone, and was also related to\r\nRinaldo, according to the quaint genealogies of the chivalrous heroes\r\nthat exact heraldry loved to draw up. He joined the four sons of Aymon,\r\nwhen they left the court after the quarrel at chess, and shared in their\r\nwild exploits; but apparently permitted no meaner interlopers in the\r\ntrade, for when he caught a party of robbers, he insisted on some\r\nunfortunate hermits being their executioners, declaring such an office\r\nwas quite as pleasing to Heaven, ‘_che dire il Pater nostro_,’ and\r\nfinally pummelling them into compliance. In Bojardo, Astolfo gained\r\npossession of a magic lance, brought by Angelica from Catay, which\r\nunhorsed all its antagonists, and secure in its aid, refused when he was\r\nrequired to deliver up to Gradasso, Bajardo and Durindana, which had\r\nbeen left in his charge while their masters were wandering after\r\nAngelica, but challenged Gradasso to single combat, defeated him, and\r\nthen went in search of his cousins. Ariosto conducts him into the\r\nenchanted palace, where every one was pursuing something lost; Rinaldo,\r\nhis horse, Bradamante, Ruggero, Ruggero, Bradamante.\r\n\r\nOne blast of Astolfo’s horn, also magical, destroyed the enchantment,\r\nand he became possessed for the time of the Hippogriff, upon whom he\r\nsoared to the terrestrial paradise, and was conducted by St. John to the\r\nmoon, where he obtained possession of Orlando’s senses, and restored\r\nthem to him. The later writers, who added to the burlesque element and\r\ndiminished the chivalrous, made more and more of Astolfo’s boastfulness,\r\ntill he is quite the buffoon of their poems. He was finally killed at\r\nRoncesvalles; and the Spaniards call him Don Estolfo.\r\n\r\nThe person killed at the same time as Rotlandus is called, by Eginhard,\r\nAnselmus, and he, no doubt, contributed in the idea of the Astolfus,\r\nCount of Champagne, whose burial after the battle is recorded by\r\nArchbishop Turpin. But the real bearer of the name of Astolfo was one of\r\nthe enemies of the Karlings, namely, Astolfo, king of the Lombards, who\r\nheld his court at Pavia, and whose encroachments on the Roman territory\r\nwere the first cause of the interference of the Franks in Italy. He was\r\nbesieged by Pepin at Pavia in 755, and forced to come to terms; but he\r\nwas evidently a very considerable sovereign; and Ernesto, Marchese\r\nd'Este, was killed in battle with him in 745. His promotion to be a\r\nPaladin is accounted for by his having been a Christian, and the\r\ncharacter he bears, by the possibility of there having been satirical\r\nsongs and poems upon him, especially at the time when Charlemagne\r\nill-treated his granddaughter, Desirata. Astolfo is still a current name\r\nin Lombardy, though we do not find it anywhere else, and its congeners\r\nonly in Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the last syllable is, of course, wolf; the first is\r\n_aast_ or _ast_, love or wishes, or if the sense of hot impetuosity be\r\nallowed, Astolf is the swift wolf. Aasta was rather a favourite name\r\nwith the maidens of the North, and Asta is not disused, though too often\r\ntreated as the short for Augusta.\r\n\r\nAstridur is from _hridhur_, an impulse, and thus would mean swift\r\nimpulse, or the impulse of love. It was greatly used by the royal ladies\r\nof the North, among whom may be specified the mother of St. Olaf, and a\r\ndaughter of Knut, called by Danish pronunciation, Estridh, but\r\ntransmuted into Margaret.\r\n\r\nThe diminutive of Ast, under various mispronunciations, named that most\r\nterrible of vikings, Hasting, whose ravages, though kept from England by\r\nthe policy originated by Alfred, were fearful all along the French\r\ncoast, and even extended to Italy. It is he who is said to have many\r\ntimes submitted to baptism, and then returned to his fury again; and\r\nthere is a curious report, that Rollo’s Normans found him settled in\r\nFrance, and reproached him with the tameness of his old age, so that he\r\ndashed away again, and returned to his ships and his piracy. Hastinc\r\noccurs in Domesday, and Warren Hastings' family claimed descent from the\r\nold Sea King.[142]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  Roscoe; Sismondi; Munch; Michaelis; _Histoire de Normandie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SECTION VII.—_Ogier le Danois._\r\n\r\nOne of the Paladins was, undoubtedly, the legacy of a much more ancient\r\nmyth, namely, Ogier le Danois. He does not play a very prominent part in\r\nthe poems of the Italians, but as Ogier the Dacian he is one of Turpin’s\r\ncatalogue of knights, and a ballad especially dear to Don Quixote thus\r\ncommences:—\r\n\r\n                      ‘De Mantua sale el Marques,\r\n                      Danes Urgel el leal.’\r\n\r\nIt proceeds to tell how he found Valdovinos, his nephew, dying under a\r\ntree, having been assassinated by the emperor’s son, Carloto. The ballad\r\nfurther relates how the Marques proceeds to court, gets Carloto tried by\r\nhis peers and doomed to death, and though el Rey Carlo banishes them all\r\nfor uttering the condemnation, the sentence is carried out.\r\n\r\nThis Italian marquis is an exceedingly droll development of the old\r\nTeutonic hero, Holger Danske. In Italy he is Oggieri, Oggero, or Uggieri\r\nil Danese; in French, Ogier le Danois; and, at times, _le damné_, or _il\r\ndannato_, which title is further accounted for by the story that he was\r\na Saracen who became a Christian, and that his friends wrote from home\r\n‘_tu es damné_,’ whence he chose to be thus christened. In the _Reali de\r\nFrancia_, Charlemagne cuts off, with his own hand, the head of an\r\nunfortunate Oldrigi, whose blood was too noble to be shed by any one\r\nelse. Now this Oggier was without doubt a contribution from the stores\r\nof Norman tradition; for Holger, or Olger, Danske is the grandest\r\nnational hero of Denmark. There is a ballad, given by Weber, where he\r\nand Tidrek the Strong have a tremendous battle, and he comes off victor.\r\nMoreover, he has eaten of the fruit of the trees of the sun and moon,\r\nand has become immortal, and there he sits with his fellows in the\r\nvaults of the Castle of Kronberg, near which are two ponds, called his\r\nspectacles. A peasant, with a plough-share on his shoulders, once lost\r\nhis way, and wandered in; he found a circle of tall old men in armour,\r\nall asleep round a stone table, with their heads resting on their\r\ncrossed arms. Holger Danske, who sat at the head of the table, raised\r\nhis head and the stone broke asunder, for his beard had grown into the\r\nstone. He asked his guest some questions about the upper world and\r\ndismissed him, offering his hand. The peasant, dreading the gigantic\r\ngrip of the old champion, gave his ploughshare. ‘Ha! ha!’ said Holger,\r\nas he felt its firmness, ‘it is well. There are still men in Denmark.\r\nTell them that we shall come back when there are no more men left than\r\ncan stand round one tun!’ But the ploughshare had been twisted round by\r\nhis fingers. Can this return of Holger be the Roger Bon Temps of the\r\nFrench peasantry?\r\n\r\nBut Holger, though I have placed him among the Paladins, might have gone\r\neven farther back than the days of Dietrich. He is a mythical king, well\r\nnigh a god, originally called Haaloge, and owing, as his sacred island,\r\nHaalogaland, or Heligoland.\r\n\r\nHis name itself is _holy_, our very word _holy_—the _halig_ of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, the _hellig_ of the North, the _heilig_ of Germany, and\r\nthese words sprang from those denoting health; as the Latin _salve_,\r\nhail, _salvus_, safe, and _salvatio_, safety, are all related to\r\nsoundness.\r\n\r\nLeaving this, as not belonging to our main subject, we find that Helgi,\r\nthe Norse form of the word for this holy old mythic king, was\r\nexceedingly popular in the North. Helgi has a poem to himself in the\r\nelder _Edda_. A son of Burnt Njal was called Helgi, and forty-two cases\r\nare found of the name in the _Landnama-bok_, and thirty-four of its\r\nfeminine, Helga. In Domesday there are five called Helgi, besides\r\nfourteen Algars, very possibly meant for Holger; and it may be suspected\r\nthat the Helie of the early Norman barons may have been as much due to\r\nthe Helgi of their forefathers as to the prophet whom they learnt to\r\nknow on Mount Carmel. Perhaps, too, Helga was the source of Ala, or Ela,\r\nby which name a good many Norman ladies are recorded, the best known of\r\nwhom was Ela, heiress of Salisbury, the wife of one William Longsword\r\nand mother of the other, one of the founders of Salisbury Cathedral, and\r\nthe witness of a vision of her son’s death in Egypt.\r\n\r\nHelgi’s descendants towards the East are far more certain matters.\r\nHelgi, called Oleg by the Russian historians, was the son of Rurik, the\r\nfirst Norman grand prince of Kief, and his daughter, Olga, visited\r\nConstantinople, and was there baptized by the name of Helena, which\r\nmakes the Russians suppose her two names to translate one another; but\r\nthey have fortunately not discarded either Oleg or Olga, which thus\r\nremain mementoes of the northern dynasty among the very scanty number of\r\nRussian names that are neither Greek nor Slavonic.\r\n\r\nIn its own country Helgi gets contracted into Helle, and Helga into\r\nHæge.[143]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Roscoe; Keightley; Marryat, _Jutland_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION VIII.—_Louis._\r\n\r\nWith the throne of the Franks, the Karlingen took their favourite prefix\r\nof the old Salic line, _hlod_.\r\n\r\nThis word, the same in root as the Sanscrit _çru_, Greek κλύω (kluo),\r\nLatin _cluo_, Anglo-Saxon _hlowan_, may possibly have been originated by\r\nthe cow, to whose voice, in our own language, the verb _to low_ is now\r\nrestricted. All mean to make a noise; and the dignity of that noise\r\nincreased, for κλυτός (klutos) was Greek for renowned, κλέος, fame, as\r\nwe saw when dealing with Cleomenes, Cleopatra, &c.; and in Latin,\r\n_clueo_, was to be famous, _clientes_ or _callers_ beset the honoured\r\nman, and _laus_ was praise or fame; and so not only have we _loud_ in\r\nEnglish, _lyde_ in the North, for the ordinary adjective, but _hlod_ or\r\n_hlud_ was the old German term for renown, and _los_ for which French\r\nknights afterwards fought and bled, and a score of other words, less\r\nrelevant to our purpose, will easily suggest themselves as current in\r\nevery European tongue, first cousin words from _laus_ or from _hlod_.\r\n\r\nThe rough aspirate at the beginning was once an essential portion of the\r\nword, and among the Franks it must have been especially harsh, since\r\ntheir contemporary Latinists always render it by _ch_.\r\n\r\nChlodio, as they call him, is numbered as the second of the long-haired\r\nSalians, the father of ‘Meroveus,’ and leader of the incursions of the\r\nFranks about 428. His grandson married the Burgundian maiden, called by\r\nthe Valkyr title of Hlodhild, or Chlodechilda, as the Latin civilization\r\nof her day called her, when it hailed her with delight as the converter\r\nof her husband to Christianity. Although canonized, her name was not in\r\ngreat use for a good many generations, and to this she probably owes it\r\nthat, when it was revived as belonging to a royal saint, for the benefit\r\nof the daughter of the good dauphin, son of Louis XV., it had not been\r\nshorn of its aspirate like all the cognate ones. It has since become a\r\nfavourite with French ladies.\r\n\r\n           ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n           │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n           │Clotilde       │Clotilda       │Klothilde      │\r\n           └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe husband of Clotilda was known to his own fierce Franks as Hluodowig,\r\nor famous war, or consecration; but when his success after his prayer to\r\nthe God of Hluodhild had brought him to abjure his Teuton gods, and\r\nreceive baptism from St. Remi, the pope accepted the only orthodox\r\nsovereign of Europe as most Christian king and eldest son of the Church\r\nby the appellation of Chlodovisus, or Clovis, the retranslation into\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nAmong his successors was found many a _fainéant_ who had nothing of him\r\nbut his prefix and his long hair, and one who is counted as Clovis II.\r\nWhen these had passed away, Charles the Great gave the name of the great\r\nfounder of the former line to one of his younger sons, the only one who\r\nlived to succeed him.\r\n\r\nWhat Hlodwig Haman’s War was called in his own day may be seen by the\r\ncurious barbaric Latin poem sung by his soldiers in honour of their\r\nexploit in setting him at liberty, when he had been treacherously made\r\nprisoner by Adelgis, Duke of Beneventum, a song that shows Latin in its\r\nfirst step towards the tongues of southern Europe.\r\n\r\n            ‘Audite omnes fines terre errore cum tristitia,\r\n            Quale scelas fuit factum in civitas Beneventum\r\n            Lluduicum comprenderunt, sancto pio Augusto.’\r\n\r\n‘Lluduicus’ is now known to the French as Louis le Debonnaire, a title\r\nthat some ascribe to his piety, others to his weakness. The Germans took\r\nhim as Ludwig, and thenceforth these two varieties held a double course,\r\nwhile the softer Provençals made him Aloys, which is now regarded, owing\r\nto a saint of its own, as a separate name. Three monarchs of the Karling\r\nline bore this favourite name, and the fifth descendant of Hugh Capet\r\nbrought it in again, to come to its especial honour with the saintly\r\nCrusader, ninth king so called, from whom it became so essentially\r\nconnected with French royalty, that after the succession of the\r\nBourbons, no member of the royal family was christened without it.\r\nIndeed, hardly any one of rank or birth failed to have it among their\r\nmany names, till its once-beloved sound became a peril to the owners'\r\nheads in the Revolution, and it has in the present day arrived at\r\nsharing the unpopularity of François.\r\n\r\nElsewhere it is chiefly a French importation; the Welsh use Lewis as an\r\nAnglicism of Llewellyn, and the Irish of Lachtna; and the Scots make\r\nrather more use of it from their old alliances and connection through\r\nthe Scottish guard. The Scottish Lodowick is probably taken from the\r\nnorthern form of the original word; just as with the Italians, Luigi is\r\nthe mere Italian version of Louis, Lodovico the inheritance from the\r\nLombards or Germans, and in this shape was long current in northern\r\nItaly, belonging in particular to the unfortunate Sforza, of Milan, who\r\nperished in the first shock between France and Italy.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Breton.    │   Scottish.   │    French.    │\r\n   │Ludovick       │Loiz           │Lodowick       │Clovis         │\r\n   │Lewis          │Loizik         │               │Louis          │\r\n   │Louis          │               │               │Looys          │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │   Spanish.    │  Portuguese.  │\r\n   │Aloys          │Lodovico       │Clodoveo       │Luiz           │\r\n   │Chlodobeu      │Luigi          │Luis           │               │\r\n   │Lozoic         │Aloïsio        │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Swiss.     │   Swedish.    │    Dutch.     │\r\n   │Ludwig         │Ludi           │Ludwig         │Lodewick       │\r\n   │Luz            │    ——————     │               │Lood           │\r\n   │Lotze          │   Bavarian.   │               │               │\r\n   │               │Wickl          │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │    Slovak.    │  Hungarian.   │\r\n   │Ludvik         │Ludvik         │Ludvick        │Lajos          │\r\n   │Ludvis         │               │Ljudevit       │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe Provençal Aloys apparently was the first shape that threw out a\r\nfeminine, the Aloyse or Heloïse, whose correspondence with Abelard was\r\nthe theme of so much sentiment, and whose fame, brought by the archers\r\nto Scotland, no doubt was the origin of the numerous specimens of Alison\r\nfound in that romantic nation.

Another St. Chlodvald, of Metz, is commonly\r\ncalled St. Clou.\r\n\r\nOne of the uncles who killed the poor boys was Hlodhari, or Chlotachari,\r\nfamous warrior, a terrible savage, but the last survivor of the\r\nbrothers, and counted in the Frank history as Chlother, or Clotaire.\r\nOthers of his race likewise were so baptized, and when the name passed\r\nto the Karlingen it was as Lothar. So was called the son of Louis le\r\nDebonnaire, whose portion, known at first as Lotharingen, came to be in\r\nLatin Lotharingia, and still remains Lorraine. Lothar did not pass away\r\nfrom Germany; one emperor, after the separation, was so called; and it\r\nfell into many forms of surnames, in especial into Luther; and when\r\nMartin Luther had rendered this almost saintly to his countrymen, they\r\nover-hastily explained it by _lother_, pure; while the Bohemians found a\r\nsimilar word in their own tongue, meaning a swan. Oddly enough, Huss\r\nsignified a goose, and the saying arose that the Bohemian goose had let\r\nfall a quill, which had been picked up by a swan of far more distant\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nLuther has a few namesakes in his own country on his own account, but,\r\nin general, Chloter has died out of Christian nomenclature.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │    German.    │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Lothario       │Clotaire       │Lothar         │Clotario       │\r\n   │Lowther        │Lothaire       │Luther         │   —————————   │\r\n   │               │               │   ————————    │   Lettish.    │\r\n   │               │               │   Italian.    │Lutters        │\r\n   │               │               │Lotario        │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nChlodoswintha, or famous height, was a Frank princess, without namesakes\r\nbeyond her own race; in fact, the use of this prefix seems to have been\r\nexclusively Frank.[144]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Sismondi, _Histoire des François_, _Littérature du Midi de l'Europe_;\r\n  Friedrich Pott; Michaelis; Thierry, _Récits des Temps Mérovingiens_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                           DESCRIPTIVE NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION I.—_Nobility._\r\n\r\nThe names connected with any great cycle of interest have been nearly\r\nexhausted, and only those remain that seem to have been chosen more for\r\nsense than connection, though afterwards continued for the sake of their\r\nowners. Several of our own truly English or Anglo-Saxon names are among\r\nthese, and in especial those with the prefix meaning noble, Æthel,\r\nAthel, Adel, Edel, or in High German, Adal. It is thought to come from\r\nthe universal word _atta_, a father, and thus to convey that the owner\r\nhas forefathers, the essence of nobility, as with the _pater_ and\r\npatrician of Rome, and the _hidalgo_, the son of something, of Spain.\r\nAdel, or Æthel, is a favourite prefix in all the Teutonic branches\r\nexcept the Scandinavian, where it does not occur at all. It is\r\nessentially Gothic,—witness Athalaric, the formidable but gentle\r\nconqueror of Rome, who well deserved his name of Noble-King. He is\r\ngenerally, however, called Alaric, and his name has been deduced from\r\n_al_, all; but the right reading seems to be that which identifies his\r\nappellation with our own English Æthelric, and the Uadalrich of Germany.\r\n\r\nUdalrich, archbishop of Augsburg till the year 973, is notable as the\r\nfirst person canonized by the pope according to the present forms, which\r\ncould not, however, have included the half-century of posthumous\r\nprobation, as he was placed in the calendar only twenty years after his\r\ndeath. Contracting his name to Ulrich, Germany made him a favourite\r\nnational saint; and we find him and his feminine spread throughout the\r\ncountries influenced by the empire, and the feminine particularly\r\nprevalent in Denmark, whither it was carried by German queens. Though\r\nthe ensuing table places all the forms of Athalaric together, it should\r\nbe kept in mind that the forms beginning with _A_ are the modern\r\nnamesakes of the great Goth, those with _U_ and _O_ the votaries of that\r\nsaint, and Adelrich is considered as a different name from Ulrich.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Italian.    │    German.    │\r\n   │Æthelric       │Alaric         │Alarico        │Adelrich       │\r\n   │Alaric         │Ulric          │Ulrico         │Alarich        │\r\n   │Ulrick         │Olery          │               │Uadalrich      │\r\n   │               │               │               │Ulrich         │\r\n   │               │               │               │Alerk          │\r\n   │               │               │               │Oelric         │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │   Bavarian.   │   Swedish.    │   Frisian.    │    Swiss.     │\r\n   │Rickel         │Alarik         │Ulrik          │Uoli           │\r\n   │               │Ulrik          │Olrick         │Ueli           │\r\n   │               │               │Ulerk          │Uerech         │\r\n   │               │               │Ulk            │               │\r\n   │               │               │Ucko           │               │\r\n   │               │               │Ocko           │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │    Slovak.    │   Lettish.    │\r\n   │Ulryk          │Ulric          │Ureh           │Uldriks        │\r\n   │               │Oldrich        │Ulrih          │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┤\r\n   │                           FEMININE.                           │\r\n   ├───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    French.    │    Roman.     │    Polish.    │\r\n   │Ulrike         │Ulrique        │Ulrica         │Ulryka         │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe successor of Alaric, who laid him in his river-grave, is known to us\r\nas Ataulfus.

The duke of\r\nBeneventum, who made Louis le Debonnaire prisoner, was Adelgis; but it\r\nis curious to find the soldiers in the dog-latin poem above alluded to,\r\nterming him Adalfieri. Odelgis was old High German.\r\n\r\nÆthel was so much used by the royal families of Kent and Wessex, that\r\nthe diminutive, Ætheling, was latterly applied to designate the heir to\r\nthe crown, and was thus continued even after the Conquest to the son of\r\nHenry I., who perished in the white ship.\r\n\r\nÆthelbryht, or Noble Splendour, named our first Christian king of Kent,\r\nalso a brother of King Alfred’s, and a missionary of the royal blood of\r\nNorthumbria, who preached in southern Germany, and died about the year\r\n700, at Egmond, where, as St. Adelbrecht, he became patron. His name was\r\ntaken at baptism by one who became archbishop of Magdeburg, who, in his\r\nturn, bestowed it on his pupil, the Bohemian Woyteich, Army-Help. This\r\nconvert was afterwards bishop of Prague, and was martyred near Dantzic\r\nwhile preaching to the heathen Prussians in 997. Adelbrecht could not\r\nfail to become national wherever the saint had set his foot; and when\r\nshortened to Albrecht, was adopted by Italy, and thence sent to\r\nJerusalem with a Latin patriarch, who, being beatified, rendered Alberto\r\nfreshly popular in the South. Albrecht, and the feminines Alberta and\r\nAlbertine, were, however, almost entirely German, until the late Prince\r\nConsort brought the name to England, where it bids fair to become one of\r\nthe most frequent of national names. Some fancy it comes from Allbright;\r\nbut the German saints, whence it was taken, are evidently direct from\r\nour English Æthelbryht, though in Germany Adelbert and Albrecht are now\r\ntreated as two separate names. Bela, which belonged to an excellent\r\nblind king of Hungary, is believed to be the Magyar form of the name.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Ethelbert      │Albert         │Azalbert       │Albert         │\r\n   │Albert         │Aubert         │               │Albertino      │\r\n   │               │Albret         │               │               │\r\n   │               │Aubertin       │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │  Wallachian.  │     Finn.     │    Danish.    │\r\n   │Adalbert       │Averkie        │               │Albert         │\r\n   │Albrecht       │   —————————   │Alpu           │Bertel         │\r\n   │Ulbricht       │    Polish.    │               │               │\r\n   │               │Albert         │               │               │\r\n   │               │Olbracht       │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nÆthelred, Noble-speech or counsel, the brother of Alfred, was almost\r\ncanonized by his subjects, and is sometimes called Ethered, whence the\r\nScottish Ethert. The nickname of our last Ethelred was a play on his\r\nname “onreade,” not meaning so much tardy as without counsel—Noble-rede\r\nthe Un-reedy. Ethelred must not be confused with Etheldred, the feminine\r\nname, properly Æthelthryth, meaning in Anglo-Saxon the Noble-threatener,\r\nconnected with the German Ediltrud, or noble maiden. Most likely names\r\nending in _trut_ had been brought to England, and as the Valkyr sense\r\nwas forgotten, the native meaning of _threat_ was attached to the word,\r\nand the spelling adapted to it. St. Æthelthryth was a queen who must\r\nhave been a very uncomfortable wife, and who, finally, retired into a\r\nmonastery, getting canonized as St. Etheldreda, and revered as St.\r\nAudry. From the gewgaws sold at her fairs some derive the term tawdry;\r\nand, at any rate, Awdry has never been extinct as a name among the\r\npeasantry, and has of late been revived, though with less popularity\r\nthan the other more modern contraction, Ethel, which is sometimes in\r\nmodern times set to stand alone as an independent name. Addy is the\r\ncommon Devonian short for Audrey.\r\n\r\nGermans do, however, seem to have used the word without another\r\nsyllable, for Adilo, or Odilo, was an old name, and Ado and Addo are\r\nstill current in Friesland, no doubt, the same as the Ade of the\r\nCambrian registers. Adela and Adèle, too, occur very early; indeed,\r\nthere is reason to think that just as in England the son was the\r\nÆtheling, in Frankland the daughter was the Adalheit, or the Adelchen.\r\nThis word _heit_ is translated as the root of the present German\r\n_heiter_, cheerful, and thus would mean noble cheer; but I suspect it is\r\nrather _heid_, condition, answering to the _hood_ or _head_ at the end\r\nof our abstract nouns, _e. g._ hardihood, and that the princess royal of\r\neach little Frankish duchy or county was thus the ‘Nobleness’ thereof.\r\n\r\nAll the feudal princes of the tenth and eleventh centuries seem to have\r\nhad an Adelheid to offer in marriage, and to have Latinized her in all\r\nmanner of ways, while practically they called her Alix (or Alisa in\r\nLombardy), a name that was naturalized in England, when _Alix la Belle_\r\nmarried Henry I. Alice is our true English form, though it has been\r\ntwisted into Alicia, and then referred for derivation to the Greek\r\nAlexios, so as often to appear in Latin documents of the later middle\r\nages in the form of Alexia; whereas in earlier times, before its origin\r\nwas forgotten, it is translated by Adelicia, Adelisa, or Adelidis.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Adelaide       │Adelaide       │Azalaïs        │Adelaïda       │\r\n   │Adeline        │Adeline        │               │Alisa          │\r\n   │Adeliza        │Adelais        │               │               │\r\n   │Adela          │Adèle          │               │               │\r\n   │Alice          │Alix           │               │               │\r\n   │Alicia         │Aline          │               │               │\r\n   │Elsie          │               │               │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │ Netherlands.  │    Slovak.    │   Lettish.    │\r\n   │Adelheid       │Adelheid       │Adelajda       │Audule         │\r\n   │Adeline        │Adelais        │               │Addala         │\r\n   │Adele          │               │               │               │\r\n   │Else           │               │               │               │\r\n   │Ilse           │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe French made great use of all the forms of the name; the Germans, in\r\nhonour, perhaps, of the Italian Queen Adelaide—whose adventures before\r\nher marriage with the Emperor Otho were so curious—preferred that\r\nvariety, and from them we received it again with our good Queen\r\nAdelaide, from whom it is becoming frequent amongst us. The German Alice\r\nis Else, a favourite old peasant word. This same contraction is common\r\nin northern England, but gets confused with Elizabeth, as in Scotland,\r\nwith Alison; and in Ireland, the prevalent Alicia is, perhaps, meant for\r\nAileen, or Helen.\r\n\r\nThe Adeleve of early Norman times is probably meant for Æthelgifu,\r\nNoble-gift, a frequent Saxon lady’s name, which we generally call\r\nEthelgiva.\r\n\r\nÆthelwold, the Saxon historian of royal blood, is Noble-power.\r\nÆthelheard, or noble resolution, answers to Adelhard, a cousin of\r\nCharlemagne, and abbot of Corbie, whom his contemporaries glorified as\r\nat once the Augustin, the Antony, and the Jeremiah of his day, and who,\r\nbeing canonized, left Alard and Alert to Friesland, and Aleardo, Alearda\r\nto Provence.\r\n\r\nÆthelstan, the Noble-stone or jewel, was second only to Alfred in\r\nability and glory, and his name lived on to the Conquest, when it is set\r\ndown as Adestan and Adstan.\r\n\r\nAdelhelm, the Noble-helmet, named the excellent and poetical Aldhelm,\r\nbishop of Sherborn, from whom the headland on the Dorset coast was once\r\ncalled St. Aldhelm’s head, but is now corrupted into St. Alban’s head.\r\n\r\nAdelgar, or Noble-spear, was chiefly continental, first figuring in the\r\nbeautiful Scottish ballad of _Sir Aldingar_, but better known in\r\nLombardy, where Allighero sprang from it, and gave his patronymic to\r\nDante Alighieri. Algarotti was another Italian derivative; and in\r\nFrance, Augier and Augereau; in Germany, Oehlkar, show that it once must\r\nhave been much in use. It is not always easy, however, to separate\r\nbetween the words from Adel and from Hilda.

When these entreaties were devotional, the Germans made\r\nthe verb _beten_, and our term for prayer, _bede_, passed on to the\r\nmechanical appliance for counting beads—the _beads_ of the rosary, while\r\nthe pensioner bound to pray for his benefactor was his _bedesman_.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether this, or the Welsh _bedaws_, life, gave his name\r\nto the Venerable Bæda, but no doubt to himself and his contemporaries it\r\nsuggested the idea of prayer. There is no doubt, however, in the case of\r\nBaudhildur, or Bathilda (the commanding heroine), the daughter of king\r\nNidudr, the lady whom Volundr carried off with him when he fled from her\r\nmother’s cruelty. After her was called Bathilda, an Anglo-Saxon slave,\r\nwho was elevated to be the wife of the second Hluodwig, and lived so\r\nholy a life, and exerted herself so much to obtain the redemption of\r\nslaves, that she was canonized, and, as _la reine Bathilde_, was greatly\r\nvenerated in the believing days of France. Denmark also used this name,\r\nhaving probably taken it from England. There ‘Dronning Bothild,’ the\r\nwife of king Ejegod, spread the name among the maidens, so that it\r\npassed to Norway as Bodild, Bodil, and even to the contraction Boel.\r\n\r\nOf English birth, too, was the Commanding-wolf—Bedvuolf, or Bodvulf—who,\r\nwith his brother, St. Adolf, went, about the end of the sixth century,\r\nto seek religious instruction in Gallia-Belgica. Adolf became bishop of\r\nMaestricht, and eponym to the Adolphuses. Bodvulf came home, and founded\r\nthe monastery of Ikano, where he died in 655, and was canonized. The\r\nmonastery was destroyed by the Danes, and the situation forgotten, but\r\nthe saint’s relics were carried away by the fugitive monks, and\r\ndispersed into various quarters, giving title to four churches in\r\nLondon, besides St. Botolf’s bridge, commonly called Bottlebridge, in\r\nHuntingdonshire, and St. Botolf’s town, in Lincolnshire, usually known\r\nas Boston, whence was called its American cousin Boston, with little\r\nrelation to the saint. The tower of the church of St. Botolf, looking\r\nforth over the Wash, was a valued landmark, and thence the saint was\r\napparently viewed as a friend of travellers, and connected with the\r\nentrances to cities, much as St. Christopher is elsewhere. Camden even\r\nsupposed him to be Boathulf, or boat helper, and his day, the 17th June,\r\nis a market day in Christiania, under the term of Botolsok, or Botsok.\r\nIn Jutland there is a church of St. Botolv; and in the North the names\r\nof Botol and Bottel are kept up; while, in England, there only remain to\r\nus the surnames of Bottle and Biddulph. The Old German forms of the two\r\nnames above-mentioned are Botzhild, Botzulf; and Botzo, or Boso, a\r\nCommander, was now and then used as a name with them, as in the instance\r\nof the troublesome duke of Burgundy, whom French historians generally\r\ncall Boson, and who is apt to be translated by _böse_, wicked.\r\n\r\nBoto, Botho, Poto, are also found in Germany, and the very earliest\r\nspecimen of this class of name is to be found in Botheric, commanding\r\nking, the name of the governor whose murder in the hippodrome caused\r\nTheodosius to give his bitterly repented command for the massacre of\r\nThessalonica. Now and then _bot_ occurs at the end of a word, as in the\r\nSpanish prince Sisebuto, the messenger of victory, or victorious\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nThese are not the same with some that look much like them, derived from\r\nthe Northern _bød_, German _badu_, A.G.S. _beado_, war. Beadwig, in the\r\nWodenic ancestry, is thus battle war, and the Gothic king of Italy,\r\nTotila, is probably made by the Romans from Bødvhar, battle pleader, a\r\nname still used in the North as Bødvar. Bødmod, Bødulf, and Bødhild, or\r\nBødvild, have also been in use.[146]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Michaelis; Pott; Sismondi; Butler; Camden; Le Beau; Kemble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION III.—_Brightness._\r\n\r\nThe root _brâj_ furnished the Greek φλέγεεν, Latin _flagrare_, and\r\nGothic _bairht_, the Anglo-Saxon _beohrt_, or _byrht_, the Old German\r\n_percht_, and Northern _bjart_.\r\n\r\nIt is a component of Frank, German, and Anglo-Saxon nomenclature, but is\r\nrarely found in genuine Norsk; the only instance in the _Landnama-bok_\r\nis Biartmar, who is noted as of Irish birth, so may have brought an\r\nAnglo-Saxon name.\r\n\r\nBertha, the most obvious of all the progeny of _biart_, has been treated\r\nof in her character as a personification of the bright Epiphany night,\r\nmixed up with an old epithet of Frigga and with the spinning Holda. So,\r\nin Swabia, these legends have formed a masculine, Berchthold, who has\r\nbecome the wild huntsman in that quarter. Berchtvold was really an\r\nEnglish prince of the Heptarchy, and Brichtold is in Domesday.\r\nPerahtholt is a veritable Old German name, making the modern\r\nBartold—Niebuhr’s name,—the Italian Bertaldo, and French Bertould.\r\nBertalda is not so likely to be the feminine of this word as to come\r\nfrom Berchthilda, like the name of Bertille, a sainted abbess of\r\nChelles.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to discover whether the most popular of all thus\r\ncommencing should be regarded as a single corrupted name, or the produce\r\nof two, of which one has the second syllable _hramn_, a raven, the other\r\n_rand_, a house. The patron saint of all alike is Bertichramnus, bishop\r\nof Mans till 623, and his Latinism leaves no doubt that he was\r\nBright-raven. It was chiefly popular in France, whence we must have\r\nobtained it, although there is no instance of it in Domesday, and it was\r\nespecially glorious in the fourteenth century, for the sake of gallant\r\nConstable du Guesclin, ‘the eagle of Brittany,’ whom Spanish\r\nchroniclers, by a droll perversion of his appellation, called ‘Mosen\r\nBeltran Claquin,’ when he came to fight their battles.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  Scotch.   │  French.   │ Provençal. │  Italian.  │\r\n   │Bertram     │Barthram    │Bertrand    │Bertran     │Bertrando   │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │  Spanish.  │Portuguese. │  German.   │ Lusatian.  │ Hungarian. │\r\n   │Beltran     │Bertrao     │Bertram     │Batram      │Bertok      │\r\n   │            │            │Berdrand    │Batramusch  │            │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe wolf was sure to accompany the raven; so Perahtolf, or Bertulf, was\r\ncanonized as an abbot in Artois, and left the German Bertulf, and our\r\nown Bardolph, the flaming comrade of Falstaff.\r\n\r\nBertwine, or Bright friend, was the St. Bertin of France, and the\r\nBertuccio of Italy, often found in the old Lombardic towns.\r\n\r\nBrihtric was the English earl who so gallantly died in defending England\r\nfrom the Danes in the unhappy days of Ethelred the Unready, and another\r\nBrihtric was the unsuccessful suitor of Matilda of Flanders, on whom she\r\nwreaked an unworthy vengeance after the Conquest.

Iring, or Irinc, is a semi-mythological\r\nperson. Old German tradition declared him to have been the counsellor of\r\nIrnvrit of Thuringia, and that when both had been taken by the Franks,\r\nhe was deceived into slaying his sovereign, after which, in his rage, he\r\nkilled the victorious Frank, laid him under his master’s body, and then\r\ncut his way through the enemy, and returned home.\r\n\r\nHe appears again in the _Nibelungen-noth_ as the Markgraf Irinch of\r\nTenemarche, or Denmark, in company with Irnvrit of Düringen, i.e.\r\nThuringia: he wounds Hagen, but is slain by him, and lamented over by\r\nKriemhild. His name was sometimes subsequently used, and is, perhaps,\r\nwhat French histories call Harenc.\r\n\r\nJørund is a northern name with a similar prefix, and means a brilliant\r\nor glittering man; but it gets called Jøren, and mixed up with Jorgen,\r\nor George.[147]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Grimm, _Deutcher Mythologie_, _Deutche Heldensage_; Munch; Alban\r\n  Butler; Sismondi; _Ayale-y-z-urita_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION IV.—_War._\r\n\r\nIn Ulfilas' Bible, ‘the multitude of the heavenly host’ is translated\r\n‘_Haryis hunniakundis managei_.’ In Anglo-Saxon, an army is _here_, in\r\nold German _heri_, in the North _her_, all perhaps coming from the ear,\r\nand _to hear_, as having been summoned, like the legion from being\r\nchosen. Thence the leader was the English Heretoga, and German Herzog,\r\nfinally translated into the Latin _dux_, and becoming political and\r\nterritorial. The doings of the _herr_ were expressed by various old\r\nwords, of which the Scottish _to harry_ is the direct descendant.\r\n_Heerfurst_, or army leader, may be the Ariovistus of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe single warrior was _har_ in the North, _hari_ in Germany, and as\r\n_ar_ is often found at the end of names. Many German critics translate\r\nthe word by the army, instead of the warrior; but Professor Munch\r\nconsiders that the warrior, _hari_, was the original meaning, and that\r\n_herjar_, his plural, afterwards came to mean the army.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and most famous of all the family is introduced to us by\r\nTacitus as Chariovalda, a Batavian prince. It is the hardened sound of\r\nHarivald, Warrior power, or ‘Army wielder,’ a name that the Germans soon\r\ncalled Heriold, and the North Harald. This soon became one of the most\r\nrenowned northern names. Harald Harfagre, or the fair-haired, was he who\r\nvowed never to trim his locks till he was sole king of Norway, and thus\r\nsent Thorer the Silent to Iceland, and Rolf-ganger to Normandy. Harald\r\nKrake, king of Sleswig, was baptized in the presence of Louis le\r\nDebonnaire, and used the already mentioned vow to forsake Thunner,\r\nScaxnot, and all their works. He afterwards introduced St. Anschar to\r\nDenmark, but like all the first Christian kings of Scandinavia, was\r\nhimself expelled from his realm by his subjects. Harald Hardrada, or the\r\nresolute, was the very crown of the poetic sea-kings of Norway, meeting\r\nwith romantic adventures in Constantinople, singing the praises of his\r\nRussian bride all across the sea, exchanging gallant messages with his\r\nnamesake Harold Godwinson at Stamford Bridge, and dying as poetically as\r\nhe had lived at the foot of his banner Landwaster. It was from the Danes\r\nthat Harold came to England with the son of Knut, and to the son of Earl\r\nGodwin, the usurper, more than half a Dane in blood and temper, who,\r\nbecause he died in battle with the Normans, is regarded by the popular\r\nmind as an English patriot, and has in very modern times had a good many\r\nnamesakes. Harald, or, as the Frisians call it, Herold, is only properly\r\nnational in Scandinavia and the islands from Iceland to Man.\r\n\r\nNext in note is what the Franks called Charibert, when it belonged to\r\nthe king of Paris, whose daughter brought Christian doctrine to Kent,\r\nand prepared the way for St. Augustine. St. Haribert was archbishop of\r\nCologne about the year 1000, and at that time the name became extremely\r\ncommon among the French nobility. A Norman settler had brought it to\r\nEngland even in the time of Edward the Confessor; and one of the many\r\nHerberts founded a family in Wales, which, in the time of Henry V., was\r\none of the first to follow the advice to use one patronymic instead of\r\nthe whole pedigree of names. It is probably owing to the honours in\r\nvarious kinds of the branches of this family that Herbert has of late\r\nyears become an exceedingly prevalent Christian name in England. Except\r\nthat the Frisians call it Harber and Hero, and Italy puts an _o_ at the\r\nend, it has no variations. Herman is confused with Eormen; and the other\r\nforms are—\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │                 Ger.

Leid (if it do not mean a\r\nroad) was the same with the word in modern German, meaning hurt or\r\nmischief, and expressed spite or violence. The North had Liedulf,\r\nafterw—ards contracted into Leiul, and no doubt the Scottish Lyulf, and\r\nGerman Lethard, Lethild, Laidrad, Laidwald, Laidwig.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit we have _neid_ or _nöt_, meaning violence or\r\ncompulsion, though it has resulted in the German _neid_, envy, and our\r\n_need_, want. We have it in the name of St. Neot, the relative and\r\nrebuker of King Alfred in his haughty days, and the hero of a legend of\r\nlittle fishes daily renewed for his food. Also Nidhard was a great\r\nchronicler of Frank history, and left a name surviving as Nyddert, in\r\nFriesland, and cut into Nitz, in Germany. There, too, were Notburg and\r\nNotger, Nidbert in France, and in the North, Notulf, afterwards written\r\nNotto. The terminal _nôt_ is, however, more common.\r\n\r\nWig or Vig is war itself, and is found in the genealogy of Odin. Wægdæg,\r\nor War day, is an ancestor of the Deiran kings.\r\n\r\nVigleîk still subsists in the North, and so does Viglaf, relic of war,\r\nthe same as that of Wiglaf, the chronicler.\r\n\r\nThe other forms are—\r\n\r\n          ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n          │      Ger.

The terminations in _wig_ are often owing\r\nto German pronunciation of the word _veh_, or _vieh_, consecration, and\r\nsometimes of the northern _veig_, liquor.\r\n\r\nThe strange northern name of Snorre, famous for the sake of that\r\nFroissart of the North, Snorre Sturleson, comes from _snerra_, strife.\r\n\r\n_Styrke_ is the strong, the same word as that in which the old\r\nchroniclers describe William the Conqueror, as ‘so very stark.’ Sterkulv\r\nand a few other forms have been found in the North.\r\n\r\nToke is a very curious old name. It seems to mean the mad or raging,\r\nand, growing into Tyke or Tyge in Denmark, was the name that was\r\nLatinized into Tycho by the celebrated astronomer Brahe, who did not\r\nleave his madness behind him with his name. The famous Jomsburg\r\nsea-rover, a sort of northern Lycurgus of the tenth century, was\r\nPalnatoke, supposed to be properly Toke, the son of Palne. Palne is an\r\nunexplained name used by the Danes, and perhaps borrowed from the Wends;\r\nbut there are a few other instances of it, among them the Anglicized\r\nEarl Pallig, the husband of Sweyn’s sister Gunhild, who was killed by\r\nEthelred the Unready.\r\n\r\n_Thiostr_ means hardness or harshness, and was in use in the North as\r\nTriostulf, since contracted into Kjostol, Thiostvald, Thiostar; and\r\nprobably Tostig, the ungracious son of Godwine, who brought Harald\r\nHardrada to invade England, took his name from thence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION V.—_Protection._\r\n\r\n_Bar_—the word for strength—has been most fertile in produce. Its\r\nprogeny are far too numerous to describe; but the most notable at\r\npresent in use are the Berg, the strength of the hills, a mountain, and\r\nBurg, a fortress.\r\n\r\nThe names derived from it are, in combination, the _bjorg_ of the North,\r\nin the masculine, meaning protector, and _borg_, the feminine, meaning,\r\nperhaps, protection,—the _berge_ of the Germans and _burg_ of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons answering to the same. The Anglo-Saxon ladies also bear\r\nnames ending with _burh_, also from the same root, and meaning a pledge,\r\nthe strength of an engagement, and the origin of our verb, _to borrow_.\r\nBurrhed, king of Mercia, bore this name; but instances of it are not\r\nvery common.\r\n\r\nBirger, Byrger, Birge, are the masculines much used in Scandinavia; and\r\nthe combinations were Biorgulv, Bergthor, Bergthora, the faithful wife\r\nof Njal, and Bergliot, the daughter of Thorer the Silent,—the same name\r\nthat has been already mentioned as the northern one that has been mixed\r\nwith the Irish Brighid, and which would mean protecting ugliness. Other\r\nforms are Bergswain, protecting youth, Berghild, answering to our\r\nMercian princess Burgenhild, and Borgny, apt to be cut down to Borny.\r\n\r\nThis is the word to which the Burgundians owed their title, as dwellers\r\nin burghs, instead of wanderers on the open plain.\r\n\r\nAnother large race of names comes from the Gothic _warjan_, Anglo-Saxon\r\n_warian_,—the ‘_ware_’ of rustic shouts in England like the ‘_gare_’ of\r\nFrance, the latter syllable of beware and aware, and the _wehrer_ of\r\nGermany. The quality of precaution furnished the North with its\r\nfavourite terminations _var_ and _vara_, indicating the possession of\r\nthe prudent virtue that makes a man _wary_. It does not begin names, but\r\nit often ends them, both in the North and Germany, as Geirvar, Hervar,\r\nAmalvara, Hildiwara, &c.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitant was the natural defender, and in Anglo-Saxon and Norsk\r\n_ware_ became synonymous with the dweller, as Cantwara, the defenders of\r\nKent, for the Kentishmen; Burgwara, the burghers; and in the North,\r\nVikvarjar, bay defender. _Ware_, a defender, is thus a commencement in\r\nthe German Warimunt, Guarding protection, the Vœrmund of the Mercian\r\ngenealogy, and Vermund of the North, while its surviving representatives\r\nin France are Guiremond and Vermont.\r\n\r\nWarenheri, or Protecting-warrior, is the Guarniero of Tasso, the Garnier\r\nof France, whence this form came to England as a surname after the Edict\r\nof Nantes, whilst Warner had been the legitimate descendant of the\r\nnative Vœrnhare.\r\n\r\nWarand, the German participle name, may have assisted in forming Guérin\r\nand Warren, unless there was a Warewine to account for it. Warnfrid or\r\nWarno, Werinhold and Warnebold, are also German.\r\n\r\nThe defender was with us the _Weard_, guard-warden, and _weardian_ was\r\nto ward or guard; as in French _garde_ and _garder_, in the North\r\n_vördhr_, in Germany _wart_, _warten_. This is the favourite\r\ntermination, the _ward_ of England passing the _wart_ of Germany, the\r\n_vard_ of the North; but of rare appearance as a commencement, though\r\nthere is an instance of a German Wartgar, or guardian-spear.\r\n\r\nThese are extremely like the words taken from _to gird_, like _gerda_,\r\n_gaard_, &c., but they are essentially different: watching is here the\r\nidea of safety, as enclosure is there.\r\n\r\nThe termination _mund_, so common among all the Teuton nations, has been\r\na very great difficulty. Some regard it as the German _mund_ or\r\n_munths_, a mouth. The fact, however, appears to be that _mund_ means a\r\nhand in the elder languages, and from a hand was early transferred to\r\nhim who used his hand in protection.\r\n\r\nAll the best authorities agree in translating _mund_ as protection; but\r\nas _mund_, a hand, is a feminine noun, the derivation from this source\r\nis a little doubtful, as the only lady’s name thus terminated is\r\nRosamond. It is never a prefix.\r\n\r\nNames ending in _mund_, hand, are often confused with those finishing in\r\n_mod_ or _muth_, meaning courage or wrath, the _mood_ of England and\r\n_muth_ of Germany. Even in very early times, Thurismund, or Thurismod,\r\nwould be indifferently written; but _mod_ is not very common, and is apt\r\nto shorten into _mo_, as Thormod, Tormo.\r\n\r\nThe Germans used to imagine that all their names ending in _hulf_ meant\r\nhelp; but this pleasant faith was destroyed by the northern wolf, and\r\nonly one real _help_ name is extant, the Helfrich of modern Germany, and\r\nHialfrek of the North, which own an ancient precedent in the old Frank\r\nHialperik or Chilperic.\r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of _ward_ runs so naturally into _hard_, that many\r\nnames, which when traced to their roots, turn out to terminate with\r\n_ward_, are spelt in German and French as if they were _hard_. The word\r\n_hard_ does, however, really enter into the composition of a few names,\r\nchiefly German. There is, however, a semi-mythical northern lady called\r\nby the amiable name of Harthgrepa, Firm-grip or Hard-claw; and\r\nHartheKnad, or, as we call him, Hardicanute, seems to have had this\r\ndistinguishing epithet added to his father’s name. The most noted of the\r\nother forms was Hardwine, Firm friend, the Hardouin of old French\r\nchroniclers, called in Italy Ardoino.\r\n\r\n    Harding, firm\r\n    Hartrich, firm king\r\n    Hartwig, firm war\r\n    Hartmund, firm protection\r\n    Hartmod, firm spirit.\r\n\r\nThe names in _rand_ have likewise been a difficulty; but the word is\r\nbest referred to the Gothic _razn_, a house, and likewise a shield, from\r\nthe protection both afford.\r\n\r\nRand is a northern prefix, and its derivatives are not easy to\r\ndistinguish from those of Regin and Raven. Röndolfr, or House wolf, was\r\ncertainly a northern name, and the same seems to have belonged to St.\r\nRadulphus, bishop of Bourges in 888, and to thirty-eight Radulfs in\r\nDomesday Book, then to the good justiciary, Ranulf de Glanville, under\r\nHenry II., to the crusading Earl Randle of Chester, and subsequently to\r\nmany a Randal, Randolf, and Ralf, or, as we foolishly spell the word,\r\nRalph.\r\n\r\nThe North had Rannveig, House-liquor, by way of a lady, and have\r\nshortened her into Rannog and Ronnau, also Rannmod, Randvid, Randve, or\r\nRandverr, house consecration.\r\n\r\nFast—in the sense of firm, not of quick—is found in the northern\r\nFastolf, in the Frank queen, Fastrade, Firm council, in Fastburg,\r\nFastmann, Fastmund. Lidvard, an old Norse name, that with us has run\r\ninto Ledyard, in its own country into Levor, is the gate ward.\r\n\r\nTryggve, a favourite old northern name, is the true or trusty. The same\r\nword sometimes serves as a termination, as in Sigtryg or Sihtric.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION VI.—_Power._\r\n\r\n_Magan_ is the Gothic and Saxon to be able, whence our defective _may_,\r\nand a number of other words in all the various northern tongues, in\r\nespecial _main_ or _chief_. The names from it are chiefly of German\r\norigin. Maginfred, or Powerful-peace, was a fine Old German name, which,\r\nby the time it came to the brave but unfortunate Sicilian, son of\r\nFrederick II., had been worn down to Manfred, whence he was called by\r\nhis subjects Manfredi, by his French foes Mainfroi, and by his English\r\ncontemporaries Mainfroy.\r\n\r\nMeginhard, main power, was a chronicler of the early ages, and in 1130\r\nappears in the Cambrai registers. The Germans used it as Mainhart, and\r\nthe English surname Maynard is from it. Meginrat made Meinrad, or\r\npowerful council, and Maginhild is still in use in the North as Magnild.\r\n\r\nThe _main_ land is, in fact, the chief land, the _main_, the chief sheet\r\nof water, or sea, and _might_ and _main_ are so closely connected\r\ntogether, that Maginhild is the most natural step to Mahthild, Main\r\nheroine to Might heroine; for _maht_ is really the modern German\r\n_macht_, and our own _might_, and both these mighty names were in early\r\nuse in Germany. Mahthild was the wife of the emperor Henry the Fowler,\r\nand afterwards became the sainted abbess of Quedlingburg. Another\r\nSwabian Mechtild was canonized after being abbess of Adilstetten; and so\r\nfashionable did the name become, that all the French maidens, who were\r\nnot Alix, seem to have been Mahthild; and in Italy it was borne by the\r\nCountess Matilda, the friend of Gregory VII., whose bequest was one of\r\nthe pope’s first steps to the temporal power, and who is introduced by\r\nDante in the flowery fields of Paradise. The Flemings call it Mahault,\r\nand thus term the lady, who, as the wife of William the Conqueror,\r\nbrought it to England. Molde, as the Normans were pleased to term it,\r\nwas regarded as so decidedly a Norman name, that the Scottish-Saxon\r\nEadgyth was made to assume it, and it continued the regnant royal name\r\nuntil it sunk beneath the influences of the Provençal Alienor. It seems\r\nas if Matilde had been freshly introduced in Flanders when Count Philip\r\nmarried Matilda of Portugal; and this, and the old traditional Mehaut,\r\nwent on side by side, just as in England did the full name Matilda, and\r\nthe Anglicized Norman contraction Maude. Of late years Maude has been\r\nfashionable, though not so near the original, nor so really graceful in\r\nsound as Matilda. The earlier Mall and Moll were from Matilda, not Mary,\r\nwhich came much later into use.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │English.       │French.        │Italian.       │Bavarian.      │\r\n   │Matilda        │Mathilde       │Matilda        │Mechtild       │\r\n   │Molde          │Mahaud         │   —————————   │Mechel         │\r\n   │Mall           │Mehaut         │German.        │Melchel        │\r\n   │Maud           │               │Mathilde       │               │\r\n   │Tilda          │               │   —————————   │               │\r\n   │Tilly          │               │Hamb.          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Tilde          │               │\r\n   │               │               │Tille          │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nMaatfred and Maatulf were old masculines.\r\n\r\nFrom _may_ and _might_ we pass to our other defective auxiliary _can_.\r\n‘Knowledge is power,’ is an idea deeply rooted in our languages, for the\r\ndifference between _I ken_ and _I can_ is well-nigh imperceptible. The\r\nSanscrit _gna_, forming the Greek verb γιγνώσκω (gignosco), reappears in\r\nthe Latin _nosco_, and the Anglo-Saxon _cnawan_. Another Anglo-Saxon\r\nform is _cunnan_, answering to the Danish _kjende_, Iceland _kunna_,\r\nGerman _kennan_. Thence our word _cunning_, knowing, and _cuth_, the\r\npast participle, known, noted, or dexterous, whence came several\r\nNorth-Anglian names, Cutha, Cuthwealh, Noted power; Cuthred, Noted\r\ncouncil; Cuthwine, Noted friend; Cuthburh, Noted pledge; and chief of\r\nall Cuthbryht, the great saint of Lindisfarn in his lifetime, of Durham\r\nafter his death, when the wanderings of his relics rendered his fame so\r\ngreat that Cuthbert is still national among the peasantry of Northumbria\r\nand the Lothians.\r\n\r\n_Kann_ seems to have been originally a past tense of _ken_, and the\r\nTeutonic mind concluded that to have learnt is to be able, for all\r\nadopted the word _can_ without an infinitive, and varied it into past\r\ntenses. To be able was likewise to dare, whence the old Teuton _kuoni_,\r\nFrank _chuon_, Saxon _cene_, German _kuhn_, bold.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, a large class of names has arisen from these words of\r\nknowledge and action, earliest of the bearers of which should stand\r\nKunimund, king of the Gepidæ, and Chunimund, king of the Suevi, both\r\nmeaning Able protection. Chuonrath, Able council, or Bold-speech, was\r\nalso Suevic, and in the form of Konrad, afterwards a world-wide name in\r\nthe Swabian house of Hohenstaufen, till the last of their generous\r\nthough impetuous blood was shed on the scaffold of Corradino, as Naples\r\nfondly termed its unfortunate young heir, the Conradin of history. Pity\r\nfor his untimely fate assisted to spread the name through all the German\r\ndependencies, and it has become so common that, like Vasili, Tom, and\r\nHeinz, Künz has descended to cats. It has the feminine Cunzila; and our\r\nold Mercian King Cenred represented it in England.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │  Provençal.   │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Conrad         │Conrade        │Cohat          │Corrado        │\r\n   │Cenred         │Quenes         │               │Currado        │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │   Bavarian.   │    Swiss.     │   Swedish.    │\r\n   │Konrad         │Kadl           │Chuedli        │Konrad         │\r\n   │Kunz           │Kuenl          │Kudli          │   —————————   │\r\n   │Kurt           │Kuenz          │Chuedler       │ Netherlands.  │\r\n   │Kuno           │Kunl           │Kored          │Koenraad       │\r\n   │               │               │Koredli        │Court          │\r\n   │               │               │Chuered        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    Danish.    │   Russian.    │   Bohemian.   │    Slovak.    │\r\n   │Cort           │Konrad         │Kunad          │Kunsch         │\r\n   │               │Kunrat         │   —————————   │               │\r\n   │               │Kondratij      │   Lusatian.   │               │\r\n   │               │               │Kunat          │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nKunigund, or Bold war, was the name of a daughter of the counts of\r\nLuxemburg, who was wife to Henry of Bavaria, the sainted emperor, and\r\nshared in his canonization, rendering her name national in Bavaria.\r\nAnother royal saint reigning in Hungary added to its honours, nor has it\r\never sunk into disuse.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  French.   │  Italian.  │Portuguese. │  German.   │ Bavarian.  │\r\n   │Cunigonde   │Cunegonda   │Cunegundis  │Kunigunde   │Kunl        │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe West Saxon Cenbyrht is the same with the German Kunibert; and Wessex\r\nlikewise reckoned among her kings Cenfyrth, or able peace, Cenfus, bold\r\nimpetuosity; while Mercia has Cenhelm and Cenwulf.\r\n\r\nAlternating with these are Cynric, Cynebald, Cynewald, Cyneburh,\r\nCynethryth, whose first syllable is _cyn_, _kin_, or _kind_, meaning, of\r\ncourse, kindred or lineage. Some refer Kunibert and Kunigund to this\r\nsame _kin_ instead of _kuhn_. This word _cyn_ is one of those regarded\r\nas the root of king, _cyning_, the son of his race or kindred.\r\n\r\nAnother word seems to have had the same double meaning of ability being\r\nstrength; for _svinn_, which is wise in the northern tongues, is in\r\nthose of central Europe, strong; the English _swith_, Gothic _swinths_,\r\nGerman _swind_; whence the present _geschwind_, and swift; moreover,\r\n_swindig_ is much, or many, in vulgar Dutch, and to _swindle_ is\r\nprobably to be too much for the victim.\r\n\r\nSuintila was an old Gothic king of Spain, Swithbert, one of the early\r\nAnglo-Saxon missionaries, especially honoured as the converter of the\r\nkindred land of Friesland, where he was revered as St. Swibert. Swithelm\r\nwas another Saxon form; but the most noted amongst us was Swithun, the\r\nbishop of Winchester, tutor to King Alfred, and endowed with many\r\nsupposed miracles, the best known of which was the forty days' rain, by\r\nwhich, like other honest English saints, he testified his displeasure at\r\nhaving his bones meddled with. The Germans have had Swidburg,\r\nSwintfried, Swidger; but in general this has served as a feminine\r\ntermination, as in Melicent, Frediswid, and in all the many _swiths_ and\r\n_swinds_ of the Franks and Goths.\r\n\r\nWhether this be the root or not, Svein is in the North a strong youth,\r\ngenerally a servant, but in the form of Svend becoming the favourite\r\nname of the kings of Denmark, belonging to him whom Ethelred’s treachery\r\nbrought down on England, where it was called Swayn, and translated into\r\nLatin as Sueno, while Tasso calls the crusading Swend, Sveno. Svinbjorn\r\noccurs in Iceland, and is our Swinburn. Svenke, again, is the active or\r\nslender youth. It is amusing to see how, from a strong man, the swain\r\nbecame a young man, then a bachelor, then a lover, and, finally, a\r\nshepherd.\r\n\r\nAnother of the mighty words that have been formed into names is _vald_,\r\nthe near relative of the Latin _valeo_. Our verb _to wield_ continues\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon _wealdan_, which named the wealds of Kent, nay, and the\r\nworld itself.\r\n\r\nVald still stands alone in the North, and once was the name of a Frank\r\nabbot of Evreux; St. Valdus, in Latin, St. Gaud, in French.\r\n\r\nThe leading name is, however, Waldheri, Powerful-Warrior appearing as\r\nthe young prince of Aquitaine, who, in the curious Latin poem which\r\nseems to represent the Frankish _Nibelungenlied_ in the south of France,\r\nflies from Attila’s court with his fellow-hostage, the Burgundian\r\nHildegunna, and her treasure, and repulses the pursuing Gunther and\r\nHagano. This same Walther was said to have afterwards reigned thirty\r\nyears in Aquitaine, and, no doubt, the name was already common there,\r\nwhen, about 990, it came to saintly glory, through a monastic saint of\r\nthat dukedom, who, being followed by two others, caused it to be spread\r\nfar and wide. Indeed, there are twenty-eight Walters in Domesday, and\r\nCambrai made plentiful use of it in the same form, till, about 1300, the\r\nspelling was altered to the French Gautier. Walther von Vogelwied, the\r\nMinnesinger, who bequeathed a perpetual dole to the birds of the air at\r\nhis tomb, well deserved that the memory of his name should be kept up in\r\nGermany, and it has always been very popular. Wat, as a contraction, is\r\nas old as Rufus’s time, and Water was in use, at least, in Shakespeare’s\r\ntime, when he shows the prophecy of Suffolk’s death by water fulfilled\r\nby the name of his assassin.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    Irish.     │    French.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Walter         │Thaiter        │Waltier        │Gualtiero      │\r\n   │Water          │               │Gualtier       │   ————————    │\r\n   │Wat            │               │Wautier        │   Spanish.    │\r\n   │Watty          │               │Gatier         │Guttierre      │\r\n   │Wattles        │               │Gautier        │               │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │  Portuguese.  │ Netherlands.  │   Lettish.    │    Dutch.     │\r\n   │Gualter        │Gualterus      │Waters         │Wolder         │\r\n   │Gualterio      │Walter         │   ————————    │               │\r\n   │               │Wouter         │    Swiss.     │               │\r\n   │               │Wout           │Watli          │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nWaldemar is an old German form imported by the Normans to England, and\r\nsometimes supposed to have been carried to Russia, and to have turned\r\ninto Vladimir; but this has been traced to a genuine Slavonic source,\r\nthough it is used by the Russians to represent Walter.\r\n\r\nThis commencement is almost exclusively German; its other varieties are\r\nWaldobert, or Walbert, the Gualberto of Italy, Waldrich, and, perhaps,\r\nWalpurg, though she is more probably from _val_, slaughter.\r\n\r\nFrodhr, Wise or learned, is sometimes an epithet, but is also used for a\r\nname, and Latinized into Frotho. The Germans have it in combination as\r\nFrodwin, wise friend, Frodbert and Frodberta, whence the French make\r\nFlobert and Floberte.\r\n\r\nThe root _mah_, which made the Sanscrit _mahat_, Zend _maz_, Greek\r\n_megas_, Latin _magnus_, Kelt _mawr_, comes forth again in Teutonic,\r\nwith _mære_, or _mara_, in Anglo-Saxon, with its comparatives _mœrre_\r\nand _mœriste_, whence our _more_ and _most_. This same sense of\r\ngreatness formed the word _maara_, fame, and _maren_, to celebrate, both\r\nold German, and it is the commencement of the Frank chieftain’s name\r\nfrom whom all the princes of the earlier race were called Meerwings,\r\nMerowig, or Famed men, the Meerwig of German writers and Meroveus of\r\nLatinity, whence the Merovée of French history.\r\n\r\nOur own Anglian Mercians had among their royal line Merowald, Merehelm,\r\nand Merewine; but, in general, _mer_, or _mar_, is used as a termination\r\nrather than a commencement, and then is always masculine. Merohelm is\r\nalso called Merchelm, so the French saint, ‘Marculphe,’ _may_ have been\r\nMerowulf, though he now looks more like Markulf, a border wolf.[148]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Munch; Sismondi; Butler; Junius; Kemble; Michaelis; Lappenburg;\r\n  Mariana; Weber and Jamieson; Donovan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SECTION VII.—_Affection._\r\n\r\nThe Teutons had a few names denoting affection. Dyre is the same in\r\nNorse as our own word _dear_, or _dyr_ in Anglo-Saxon. An inlet on the\r\nnorth-west corner of Iceland is still termed Dyrefiord, from one of the\r\nfirst settlers, and Dyre was the hero of a ballad in the _Kæmpeviser_,\r\nanswering to the Scottish Katharine Janfarie, the original of young\r\nLochinvar. The old Germans had Dioro and Diura, and the Anglo-Saxons\r\naffectionately called the young sons of their nobility Dyrling, or\r\ndarling.\r\n\r\n_Leof_, the German _lieb_, beloved, is much used by the Anglo-Saxons.\r\nTwo bishops, one of Wells, and afterwards primate, the other of\r\nCrediton, were called Leofing, or Lyfing. The first was certainly\r\nproperly Ælfstan, so it is probable that in both instances Leofing was\r\nmerely an endearing name that grew up with them, and displaced the\r\nbaptismal one; but its Latin translation, Livingus, shows the origin of\r\nthe surname of Livingstone.\r\n\r\nEngland also had Leofwine, Beloved friend, the only native name borne by\r\nany of the sons of Earl Godwin. An earlier Leofwine was a member of St.\r\nBoniface’s mission, and converted many of the heathens on the banks of\r\nthe Weser; and as St. Lebwin is patron of Deventer, probably occasioned\r\nthe name of Lubin, which, from being borne by French peasants, crept\r\ninto pastoral poetry.\r\n\r\nAnother of the same mission party was Leobgytha, or Dear gift, called\r\nalso Liuba and Liebe, who was sent for from her convent at Wimborne to\r\nfound one of the earliest nunneries in Germany. It is probably from her\r\nthat Lievine became an old Cambrecis name.\r\n\r\nLeof seems to have been the special prefix of the earls of Mercia, for\r\nwe find among them, besides Leofwine, Leofstan and Leofric, the last the\r\nbest known for the sake of his wife and of Coventry.\r\n\r\nThe continental instances of the prefix are among the Spanish Goths,\r\nLiuva, Leovigildo, and Liuvigotona; and among the Franks, Leobhard, or\r\nLiebhard, a saint of Touraine.\r\n\r\nThe only present survivor of all the varieties is probably, if we\r\nexclude the occasional Puritan Love, the Cornish and Devon feminine\r\nLovedy.\r\n\r\nFar more universal are the names derived from the old word _vinr_, or\r\n_wine_, meaning friend or object of love, the same which has left a\r\ndescendant in the German _wonne_, affection, and the Scottish adjective\r\n_winsome_. It is a continual termination, as must have been already\r\nobserved, and we had it as a commencement in our great English\r\nmissionary Winfrith, or Friend of peace, the Devonian bishop who spread\r\nChristianity over Germany, but who is far better known by the Latin\r\nsurname which he assumed, namely, Bonifacius. Winibald was another of\r\nour missionary saints, and Germany has also had Winrad, Winrich, and\r\nWinmar, but the Welsh Wenefred must not be confused with it.\r\n\r\n_Mild_, or _mild_, is exclusively Saxon; nay, almost exclusively\r\nMercian, for it only occurs in one family; that of King Merowald, who\r\nnamed his three daughters Mildgyth, Mildburh, and Mildthryth. All became\r\nnuns, the two latter abbesses, one in Shropshire, the other in the isle\r\nof Thanet, and they were canonized as Milburga and Mildreda. Milborough,\r\nas the first became Anglicized, was found within the last century in\r\nShropshire, and Mildred was never entirely disused; it belonged to the\r\ndaughter of Burleigh, and has lately been much revived, under the notion\r\nthat it means mild speech; but _red_ is always masculine, and, as has\r\nbeen before said, _thryth_ commands or threatens, so that Mildthryth is\r\nthe gently strict.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VIII.—_Appearance._\r\n\r\nMiss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs was verily named after a beard.\r\nSkegg means neither more nor less than a beard, and strange to say,\r\nBardr and Skegg were both fashionable names in the North; indeed, one\r\nIcelandic gentleman rejoiced in the euphonious title of Bardr Bla-skegg,\r\nor Beard Blue-beard.\r\n\r\nBut we have an independent name of this class. William de Albini, the\r\nsecond husband of Henry I.’s widow, Alix of Louvaine, wore moustachios,\r\nwhich the Normans called _gernons_, and thus his usual title was William\r\n_als Gernons_; and as the common ancestor of the Howards and Percys, he\r\nleft this epithet to them as a baptismal name, one of the most whimsical\r\nof the entire roll. From the Percys it came to Algernon Sidney; and\r\npartly through his admirers, partly through inheritance, and partly\r\nthrough the love of trisyllables, has become diffused in England.\r\n\r\n_Faxe_ meant the hair or tresses, as may be seen in the names of the\r\nhorses of day and night, Skinfaxi and Hrinfaxi. Two instances of it are\r\nfound in the _Landnama-bok_, Faxi, a colonist from the Hebrides, and\r\nFaxabrandr, most likely an epithet due to some peculiarity of hair,\r\nprobably whiteness, or perhaps fieriness; but it was not common, though\r\nit came to England to be the surname of Sir Thomas Fairfax.\r\n\r\nThe name of our excellent friend Wamba in _Ivanhoe_ must probably have\r\nbeen taken from one of the Visigothic kings of Spain, with whom it was\r\nmost likely a nickname, like that of Louis de Gros in France, for it\r\nmeans nothing but the belly. Epithets like this were not uncommon, and\r\nsometimes were treated as names, such as Mucel, or the big, the\r\nsobriquet of the earl of the Gevini; or Budde, the pudding, the person\r\nwho showed Knut the way over the ice. Many of those used in England were\r\nKeltic, showing that the undercurrent of Cymric population must still\r\nhave been strong.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how very few are the Teuton names taken from the\r\ncomplexion—in comparison with the many used by the Kelts, and even by\r\nthe Romans—either because the Teutons were all alike fair, or because\r\nthey thought these casual titles unworthy to be names. Bruno was\r\nexclusively German, and may perhaps be only a nickname, but it came to\r\nhonour with the monk of Cologne, who founded the Carthusian order, and\r\nhas been used ever since; and the North has Sverke, Sverkir, swarthy or\r\ndark, a famous name among the vikings.\r\n\r\nFar more modern is the name of Blanche. The absence of colour is in all\r\ntongues of Western Europe denoted by forms of _blec_. In Anglo-Saxon,\r\n_blœc_ or _blac_ is the colour black, but _blœca_ is a _bleak_, empty\r\nplace, and _blœcan_ is to bleach or whiten; _blœco_, like the German\r\n_bleich_, stands for paleness. It is the same with German and Norse, in\r\nthe latter of which _blakke hund_ is not a black dog but a white one.\r\nAll these, however, used their own _weiss_ or _white_ for the pure\r\nuncoloured snow; while the negative _blœc_, or colourless, was adopted\r\nby the Romance languages, all abandoning the Latin _albus_ in its\r\nfavour. It is literally true that our _black_ is the French _white_;\r\n_black_ and _blanc_ are only the absence of colour in its two opposite\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nBlach, Blacheman, Blancus, and Blancard, all appear in Domesday; but\r\nBlanchefleur and Blanche, seem to have been the produce of romance. The\r\nmother of Sir Tristrem was Blanchefleur, a possible translation of some\r\nof the Keltic Gwenns or Finns, and it probably crept from romance to\r\nreality among the poetical people of southern France. The first\r\nhistorical character so called was Blanca of Navarre, the queen of\r\nSancho IV. of Castille, from whom it was bestowed on her granddaughter,\r\nthat child of Eleanor Plantagenet, whom her uncle, King John, employed\r\nas the lure by which to detach Philippe Auguste from the support of\r\nArthur of Brittany. The treaty only bore that the son of Philippe should\r\nwed the daughter of Alfonso of Castille; the choice among the sisters\r\nwas entrusted to ambassadors, and they were guided solely, by the sound\r\nof the name borne by the younger, that of the elder sister, Urraca,\r\nbeing considered by them hateful to French ears, and unpronounceable to\r\nFrench lips. John was punished for his policy, for Blanche’s royal\r\nEnglish blood was the pretext of the pope in directing against him her\r\nhusband, Louis the Lion, but no choice could have been a happier one for\r\nFrance, since Blanche of Castille was the first and best of her many\r\nqueen-regents.\r\n\r\nFrom her the name became very common in France. One of the daughters of\r\nEdward I. was so called, probably from her, in honour of his friendship\r\nfor her son; it became usual among the English nobility, and is most\r\ncommon in Italy, though it is somewhat forgotten in Spain.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  Spanish.  │Portuguese. │\r\n   │Blanch      │Blanche     │Bianca      │Blanca      │Branca      │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nA Swedish heroine called Blenda made this name, from _blenden_, to\r\ndazzle, common in her own country, but it is not known elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Koll_, with a double _l_, meaning head, is sometimes used in northern\r\nnames, but far less commonly than _kol_, cool, or rather in the act of\r\ncooling after great heat. The great blast-bellows with which the gods\r\ncharitably refreshed the horses of the sun, are called in the Eddaic\r\npoetry, _isarnkol_, or iron coolers, and there may have been some\r\nallusion to this in the names of Kol and Kale, which alternated in one\r\nof the old northern families. But as the cooling of iron involved its\r\nturning black, _kolbrünn_ meant a black breastplate, and was thus used\r\nas a by-name; and it may be in this sense of black that _kol_ enters\r\ninto the composition of Kolbjorn, black bear, Kolgrim, Kolgrima;\r\nKolskegg would thus be black-beard; but Kolbein can hardly be black-leg,\r\nso, perhaps, it may refer to the bones being strong as wrought iron; and\r\nKolfinn and its feminine are either cool-white or refer to Finn’s\r\nstrength. Colbrand is in English romance the name of the Danish giant\r\nkilled by Guy of Warwick, at Winchester; but the Heptarchy displays a\r\nvery perplexing set of Cols, as they have been modernized, though they\r\nused to be spelt Ceol. There were three Ceolwulfs in Bernicia, Mercia,\r\nand Wessex; Ceolred in Mercia, Ceolwald in Wessex, Ceolnoth on the\r\nthrone of Canterbury. Are these the relatives of the northern _kol_,\r\ncool, or are they _ceol_, keel, meaning rather a ship than merely the\r\nkeel, as it does now? Or, on the other hand, are both these, and the\r\nnorthern _col_, adaptations of the Keltic _col_ or _gall_, like those\r\nalready mentioned of Finn? Their exclusive prevalence among the\r\nScandinavians and Anglo-Saxons would somewhat favour the notion.\r\n\r\nThe northern feminine terminal, _frid_, belongs to this class, and means\r\nthe fair, or pretty, from the old northern _fridhr_, though it is most\r\ndeceitfully like _fred_, or _frey_, peace, and is probably from the same\r\nroot.\r\n\r\nTeitr is a northern man’s name, meaning cheerful: _Zeiz_ answers to it\r\nin old German; and though the analogue in Anglo-Saxon does not otherwise\r\noccur in any Anglo-Saxon work, yet we find from Bede that Æthelburh, the\r\ndaughter of Æthelbeorht and Bertha, of Kent, who carried her\r\nChristianity to her husband, Eadwine, was also called Tâte, by which we\r\nmay gather that she was particularly lively and cheerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION IX.—_Locality._\r\n\r\nA large and interesting class of names relate to country, and express\r\nthe birthplace or the wandering habits of the original bearers.\r\n\r\nThe word _land_ was one of these. Its primary meaning seems to be the\r\nabode of the people. Long ago we spoke of the Greek λαος, prominent in\r\nLaodamia, and many other of the like commencement. An almost similar\r\nterm runs through the Teutonic tongues; the Saxon _leod_, German\r\n_leute_, Frank _liade_, Northern _lydhr_. The _leod_, or _leute_, seem\r\nto have been the free inhabitants, including all ranks, and thence we\r\nhave the _laity_, for the general people, and the _lewd_, which has sunk\r\nfrom the free to the ignorant, and then to the dissipated.\r\n\r\nThe great region of these names taken from the people is Germany.\r\nLeutpold, the people’s prince, was a canonized Markgraf of Austria, in\r\nthe days when that family had hardly yet begun its course of marrying\r\ninto greatness, and making Leutpold better known at every stage, and by\r\neach new dialect differently pronounced, till it turned into Leopold,\r\nand was confounded with the old lion names. Indeed, in the old Swiss\r\nballad on the battle of Sempach, translated by Scott, Leopold the\r\nHandsome is called the Austrian Lion. The recurrence of the name in the\r\nmodern imperial line has made it European, and the close connection of\r\nour own royal family with the wise king of the Belgians has brought it\r\nto England. Of course, it has not escaped a modern German Leopoldine.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  German.   │   Slav.    │\r\n   │Leopold     │Léopold     │Leopoldo    │Luitpold    │Leopoldo    │\r\n   │            │            │            │Leupold     │Poldo       │\r\n   │            │            │            │Leopo       │Poldi       │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nLeutgar, the people’s spear, was a good bishop of Antrim, who was\r\nspeared by the people, or, at least, murdered by them, in the furious\r\nwars of the long-haired kings, and was revered as a martyr under the\r\nLatin form of Leodigarius. A priest of Chalons was canonized by the same\r\nname, which is in France Leguire, and was brought as a territorial\r\nsurname to England as St. Leger.\r\n\r\nLiutgarde seems to have been a Frank saint, but there is no account of\r\nher in Alban Butler; but hers is one of the favourite old names at\r\nCambrai. Liutprand, the people’s sword, is one of the chief chroniclers\r\nof early French history, and the other forms are Liuther, the only one\r\naccepted by the North, and that in the form of Lyder.\r\n\r\n    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n    │     Ger.

Lantperaht, or the country’s brightness, is the most noted of\r\nthese, having been borne by three saints of Maestricht, Lyons, and\r\nVenice, and having thus become national in all the countries around; but\r\nit is universally corrupted into Lambert, and has been generally derived\r\nfrom a lamb.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  English.  │  French.   │  Italian.  │  German.   │   Dutch.   │\r\n   │Lambert     │Lambert     │Lamberto    │Landbert    │Lambert     │\r\n   │            │Lanbert     │            │Lambert     │Lammert     │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nLanderich, or country’s ruler, was an early Frank saint, who has left\r\nLandry to be still frequent among the Flemish and French peasantry.\r\n\r\nLandfrang, lord of the country, was the Lombardic Lanfranco, whence the\r\nLanfranc of the archbishop of Canterbury, whom William the Conqueror\r\nimposed on the English Church, but who brought in fresh vigour and\r\nlearning. Landfrid has left the surname Laffert to France; its\r\ncontraction Lando belonged to a saint, and has the feminines Landine and\r\nLandoline. There are also recorded Landolf, Landrad, Landrada, and\r\nLandinn.\r\n\r\nIf Germany and Italy talked of dwellers in the land, the North, with its\r\nseas and numerous islets, distinguished the islanders with the word Ey,\r\nor Øi, the word that we use to this very day in speaking of Guerns_ey_\r\nJers_ey_, &c., of an _eyot_ in a river; and even in Sodor, that puzzling\r\ncompanion to the Isle of Man, which once was the Sudeyas, or South\r\nIsles, the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nThe most famous northern island name is Eystein, or Øistein, much in use\r\namong the early kings, and especially honoured for the sake of the good\r\nbrother of Sigurd the Crusader, who stayed at home and worked for his\r\npeople’s good, while Sigurd was killing blue men in the land of the\r\nSaracens. The Danish Eystein was turned into Austin, or Augustin, to be\r\nmore ecclesiastical, and this may be the origin of some of our Austins.\r\nEyulf, or the island wolf, has become, in the course of time, Øiel and\r\nØiuf. Eyvind, who appears in the _Landnama-bok_ with the unpleasant\r\nsobriquet of Skalldur Spiller, or the poet spoiler, is supposed to have\r\nbeen the Island Wend, a reminiscence of the Wends on the shores of the\r\nBaltic. It was a very common name, and became Øvind and Even, while\r\nEymund, in like manner, was turned into Emund. An island thief was not\r\nwanting, as Eythiof; nor an island warrior, as Eyar; also Eyfrey,\r\nEylang; and the ladies Eygerd, Eydis, Eyny, and Eyvar, or, as Saxo calls\r\nher, Ofura.\r\n\r\nAn island is also sometimes _holm_, whence the northern Holmstein and\r\nHolmfrid, with Holmgeir, which gets mixed with Holger.\r\n\r\nPersons of mixed birth were drolly called by the actual fractional word\r\n_half_, in Germany Halbwalah, half a foreigner, or half a Wallachian,\r\nand Halbtüring or half a Thuringian; and in the North, generally,\r\nHalfdan, half a Dane. So early was this in use that there was a mythical\r\nking, Halfdan, from whom the name was adopted by many a true-born Dane\r\nand Northman, and has been Latinized as Haldanus.\r\n\r\nTravellers had their epithets, which probably came to be family names.\r\n_Lide_, Wanderer, was compounded in Haflide, sea wanderer; Vestlide,\r\nwest wanderer; Vetilide, winter wanderer; and Sumalide, or summer\r\nwanderer, which last was current among the lords of the Isles, and kings\r\nof Man, in the shape of Somerled, or, in Gaelic, Somhle; but ‘the heirs\r\nof mighty Somerled’ did not long keep up his name.\r\n\r\nTravellers again had their name from _fara_, the modern German _fahren_,\r\nand the scarcely disused English _to fare_, meaning to journey. The most\r\nnoted instance is Faramund, who, in the guise of Pharamond, is placed at\r\nthe head of the long-haired Frankish dynasty, far travelled it may be,\r\nfrom the river Yssel whence the Salic stock took the title that was to\r\npass to one peculiar law of succession; also Farabert, Farulf, and\r\nFarthegn, contracted into Farten, and Faltin, and then supposed to be a\r\ncontraction of Falentin, or Valentine. _Thegn_ did, in fact, originally\r\nmean a servant, so that Farthegn was either the travelled servant, or\r\nthe travelled thane. Fargrim appears in Domesday; but these names are\r\nnot easy to divide from those taken from _waren_, to beware.\r\n\r\nEven the exile had his sorrows commemorated in his children’s names. No\r\ndoubt if we could meet with the story of the original Erland, we should\r\nfind that he was born under the same circumstances as Peregrine Bertie,\r\nfor the name is from the old northern _er_, out, or away from, and\r\n_land_. Erland is the Outland, the banished man, and he must have been\r\nbeloved, or celebrated, for Erlendr, as the Icelanders had it, occurs\r\nplentifully, with its diminutive Erling, and perhaps the corruption\r\nElling.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Bishop Hatto’s name was anciently Hazzo, and is\r\ntranslated a Hessian.\r\n\r\nViking has been used as a Christian name in Norway in comparatively\r\nmodern days, in memory of the deeds of the terrible Vikingr of old; but,\r\nin spite of the resemblance in sound, it must not be suspected of any\r\nrelation to sea-kings, being only the inhabitant of a vik, or bay, of\r\ncourse the most convenient abode for a sea-rover.\r\n\r\nThe sea, _haf_, or _hav_, as it was called in the North, named Haflide,\r\nHafthor, and Hafgrim, as well as the mythic hero, Haflok, the Dane,\r\nwhose life, according to his legend, was saved by his faithful servant\r\nGrim, the founder of Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, the native place of our\r\nown Sir Henry Havelock, who was bewailed by the Danish school-children\r\nas their own ballad hero. The two feminine terminations _laug_ and\r\n_veig_ may have been in its honour, but it is much to be feared that\r\nthey only meant liquor, and at the best were allusions to the costly\r\nmead of the gods, the drink of inspiration, or the magic bowls that\r\ninflamed the Berserks. Nay, men rejoiced in the name of Ølver or Ølve,\r\nmeaning neither more nor less than Ale, _øl_, which acquires a _v_ in\r\nthe oblique cases and plural. Ø1ver and Olaf have, no doubt, been\r\nconfounded into the modern Oliver.\r\n\r\nKnud, or Knut, a very common northern name, is a very puzzling one. Its\r\norigin and nationality are Danish, and it only came to Norway by\r\nintermarriages, nor does it appear at all in the _Landnamabok_. The\r\ngreat Dane who brought it here is called by the chroniclers Canutus,\r\nfrom some notion of making it the Latin _hoary_, and thus we know him as\r\nCanute; but even in Domesday, one landholder in Yorkshire, and another\r\nin Derbyshire, are entered as Cnud. The whole North, and the inhabitants\r\nof the Hebrides, use the name, which comes from the same root as our\r\n_knot_, and properly means a protuberance, a hill, or barrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SECTION X.—_Life._\r\n\r\nLife played its part among Teutonic names. One old word conveying this\r\nsense was the Gothic _ferchvus_, Saxon _feorh_, and Northern _fiorh_.\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon _feorh_ also meant youth, and thus passed on to mean a\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nThere are not many names from thence, but one of the few has been a\r\ngreat perplexity, and has been explained in many ways, _i. e._ the\r\nGothic Ferhonanths, the last syllable being _nanth_, daring, so that its\r\nsense would be, ‘adventuring his life.’ It was the Spanish Goths who\r\nused this gallant name, and made it with their Romance tongues into\r\nFernan and Fernando. San Fernando, king of Castille, and father of our\r\nown Eleanor, made it a favourite for his royal line; and a younger son\r\nof Castille so called, being heir of Aragon, carried it thither, and\r\nthence it passed to southern France, where the grandson of old King René\r\nwas Ferrand or Ferry. Aragon again bestowed it upon Naples; but it was\r\nthere prolonged into Ferdinando, whilst Spanish elisions had at home\r\nturned it to Hernan, as the conqueror of Mexico termed himself. It was\r\nbestowed upon the second son of Juana la Loca, who was born in Spain,\r\nand long preferred there to his brother, though it was to the imperial\r\nthrone that he was destined to succeed, and to render his Spanish name\r\nnational through Germany, where Ferdinand has long been a sore puzzle;\r\nsometimes explained by _fart_, a journey, and sometimes by _fried_,\r\npeace, but never satisfactorily. The contraction Nandel was the shout of\r\nthe mob in the ears of Ferdinand, the obstinate, narrow-minded man who\r\nwon his cause by mere force of undivided aim. It is so popular in Spain\r\nand Germany as in each to have a feminine, Fernanda and Ferdinandine.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │   English.    │    French.    │   Spanish.    │   Italian.    │\r\n   │Ferdinand      │Ferdinand      │Fernando       │Ferdinando     │\r\n   │               │Ferrand        │Hernando       │Fernando       │\r\n   │               │Ferry          │Hernan         │Ferrante       │\r\n   ├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n   │    German.    │    Polish.    │   Lettish.    │               │\r\n   │Ferdinand      │Ferdynand      │Werlands       │               │\r\n   │Nandl          │               │               │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nFerahbald and Ferahmund were forgotten old German forms, and Fjorleif\r\nwas known in the North.\r\n\r\nThis is, probably, relic of life, as otherwise the word would be a\r\nreduplication; but the termination _leif_ or _lif_ is sometimes used,\r\nbeing our very word life.\r\n\r\nThere are two words which may be said to form names of progress, the\r\nGerman _gang_, from to go, sometimes commencing as in Gangolf, but more\r\nusual at the end of a word; and the Northern _stig_, from the universal\r\nroot _stig_, found in the Greek ἔστιχον, and in our step and stile, also\r\nstairs, for the usual sense of the word implies mounting upwards; and\r\nthe name of the semi-Danish archbishop of Canterbury who crowned Harold,\r\nand was one of the Conqueror’s lifelong captives, was the participle\r\nStigand, mounting, and was long extant in the North, as well as the\r\nDanish Styge and Stygge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART VII.\r\n\r\n                        NAMES FROM THE SLAVONIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION I.—_Slavonic Races._\r\n\r\nThe last class of names that have had any influence upon European\r\nnomenclature are those borne by the Slavonic race dwelling to the\r\neastward of the Teutons, and scarcely coming into notice before the\r\nperiod of modern history.\r\n\r\nNor, indeed, have they been ever very prominent. Slipping into the\r\nregions left empty by the Teutons, or depopulated by the forays of the\r\nTatars, these nations have carried on a life for the most part obscure\r\nand industrious, though now and then drawn, either by Mongol fury on the\r\none hand, or by Teuton ambition on the other, into gallant exertions;\r\nbut a genuine Slavonian has seldom or never extended his power far\r\nbeyond his own country. Imaginative and poetical, they have nevertheless\r\nfew ancestral traditions, they have no history previously to coming\r\nunder the influence of other countries, and their migrations are even\r\nless known than those of the early Kelts and Teutons.\r\n\r\nAll that we do know is that by the time the ten horns of modern empire\r\nwere developing themselves, there was a long strip of Slavonians, or\r\nWends, extending from the White and Baltic seas down to the Black and\r\nAdriatic, making a division between the Teutons and the Tatars, but\r\nutterly unable to oppose a barrier when periodical fits of fury and\r\ninvasion seized upon the wild hordes to the eastward of them.\r\n\r\nWends, or Venedi, seems to have been one universal national term;\r\n_Slava_ furnished another. The word, like the Greek κλύα and Teuton\r\n_hlod_, is from the root _çru_, and denotes fame or glory; and it is\r\nconstantly employed in the personal names, commencing Slavoljub,\r\nglorious love, Slavomir, glorious peace, Slavomil, friend of glory, and\r\nterminating Siroslav, far-famed, and many others, usually rendered as\r\n_slas_ and _slaus_.\r\n\r\nBut just as Geta, the Goth, stood for a bondsman in classical\r\nliterature, so when the Slav became the captive of the German, his once\r\nglorious epithet became the generic term of the thrall, bought and sold,\r\nwhile the derivatives of the Latin _servus_ were reserved for the free\r\nhired domestic. Glory had literally turned to slavery, perhaps the more\r\nreadily because it is the Slav who, of all the Indo-European race, most\r\nreadily bows beneath the yoke, so that to this day, his forms of\r\ncourtesy are the most servile, his respectful address the most\r\nextravagant, used in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt our first glimpse of the Slavonic nations, the Danube flowed through\r\nthe midst of a considerable settlement of them, known to classical\r\nwriters as Bulgarians, and most savage foes to the Eastern empire, who\r\nlost army after army in expeditions against these barbarians.\r\n\r\nIn the North, two great merchant republics at Kief and Novgorod were\r\nconducting the trade of the North, and apparently living an honourable\r\nlife of industry and self-government.\r\n\r\nAll around the east and south of the Baltic were other large territories\r\noccupied by Slavonians, from Finland to Jutland; and, with few\r\nexceptions, most of these lands still own a Slavonian population, though\r\nonly one has a native government.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols have, perhaps, chiefly influenced the changes undergone by\r\nthe Slaves. The great and terrible Tatar invasion of Attila trod them\r\ndown, but by ruining the Roman empire, established homes for them,\r\nespecially round the Danube. In the kingdom now called Hungary, there is\r\na large Slavonian population, called Slovak, from the term _slov_, a\r\nword, living mixed with the remains of the Huns, but keeping a separate\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe mountain-girt lozenge of Bohemia was also a separate kingdom, with\r\nits own language, not the same, though nearly related, and more\r\nresembling that of the fierce elective kingdom of Poland.\r\n\r\nThe migrations of the Teutons drove most of the Wends out of Denmark\r\ninto the marshy and sandy lands at the mouth of the Vistula; and,\r\nsomewhat later, home quarrels, and fears of the Tatars, impelled the\r\nrepublics of Russia to call in the aid of the Northmen, who quickly put\r\nan end to the freedom of the cities, and set up the principality that\r\nwas the germ of the Russian empire.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church converted the Bulgarians about the year 870, and the\r\ntranslations of the liturgy and Scriptures, made for their benefit, have\r\nbeen the authorized version of the Slavonians ever since. The same\r\nmissionaries, Cyrillus and Methodius, likewise baptized the first\r\nChristian king of Bohemia; and in the next century, a Bohemian bishop,\r\nAdalbert of Prague, converted Hungary and Poland. But these three realms\r\ngave their allegiance to the Western, not the Eastern Church; and though\r\nHungary received much of her civilization from Constantinople, her faith\r\nwas with Rome. The Norse Grand Princes of Muscovy themselves sought\r\nChristianity from Byzantium, and the Russian Church has ever since been\r\nthe most earnest and conservative of the Eastern Churches.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic Slavonians held out longest against the Gospel. Missionaries\r\npreached to them, and orders of knighthood crusaded against them on far\r\ninto modern history, and the final period of their conversion and\r\nsettlement into small duchies or realms, held by the conquering knights,\r\nis hardly worth tracing out.\r\n\r\nThe next step in general Slavonic history is the great Turkish outbreak,\r\nwhich almost crushed Muscovy, and infused a strong Tatar element into\r\nthe Russian population; and, finally, conquered the Greek empire, and\r\nwith it the Bulgarian lands, which, though never Mahometanized, have\r\never since remained under Turkish dominion.\r\n\r\nThe kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, with the other western Slavonic\r\nprovinces, were one by one absorbed into the German empire, or by the\r\nHouse of Austria—it made little difference which was the original\r\ntenure—all are ‘Austrian’ now, whether willingly or not.\r\n\r\nWith the same skill, the House of Brandenburg obtained the domains of\r\nthe Baltic Slaves, and formed the kingdom of Prussia, very Teutonic to\r\nthe west, and very Slavonic to the east.\r\n\r\nMeantime, after a long period of exhaustion, almost of extinction, the\r\nMuscovites came forth from the Tatar oppression stronger than ever; and\r\nby gradual conquests from their former enemies, at length formed their\r\nhuge empire of the east.\r\n\r\nAnd Poland, after many a turbulent election, many a summons to German\r\nprinces to hold the reins of its restless multitude, was finally and\r\nunrighteously dismembered and divided, and the cry of its wrongs has\r\never since rent the ears of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe existing Slavonian languages are the Russian, the literary language\r\nof the great empire; the Livonian, or the language spoken by the persons\r\nwho are not of Finnish blood in the elbow beneath the Gulf of Finland;\r\nthe Lettish and Lusatian, used by the old Prussian subjects and their\r\nneighbours in Russia; the Polish; the Slovak, spoken in Hungary; the\r\nServian, Illyrian, and Croatian, all representing the old Bulgarian.\r\n\r\nOf all these, it is perhaps the Polish that has contributed the most\r\nnames to the European stock, and they are but few; but there were\r\nintermarriages, and friendly intercourse, besides occasional elections\r\nto the Polish throne; and, latterly, the dispersion and exile of the\r\nPolish nobility carried their names into distant parts of Europe, and\r\ngave them a romantic interest.\r\n\r\nBohemia and Hungary sent a few names into the Austrian line, but they\r\nsoon died out; and Russia uses comparatively few native Slavonic names,\r\nbut makes chief use of those of the saints of the Greek Church.\r\n\r\nSlavonian languages are said to be soft in their own speech, but our\r\nletters clumsily render their sounds, and make them of cumbrous length;\r\nand the few names that have been adopted have been severely mangled.\r\n\r\nThey are, for the most part, grand and poetical compounds, often exactly\r\ncorresponding to Greek or Teutonic names, and with others more poetical\r\nthan those in either of these other languages, such as Danica, the\r\nMorning star; Zwezdana, or in Russian, Swetlana, a Star; Zora, Zorana,\r\nZorica, the Slovak Aurora; and Zorislava, the Dawn of glory; Golubica,\r\nthe Dove; Lala, the Tulip. The Slaves use likewise the amaranth, or\r\neverlasting flower, as a name both for men and women, namely, Smiljan\r\nand Smiljana; and while a man may be called Dubislav, or Oak fame, the\r\nServians and Illyrians call their daughters after fruits,—Grozdana, Rich\r\nin grapes; Jagoda, the Strawberry; and Kupina, or Kupiena, the\r\nGooseberry.[149]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  Kombst, (in Johnson’s) _Physical Atlas_; Max Muller, _Lectures_; Le\r\n  Beau, _Bas Empire_; Schleicher, _Sprachen Europen_; Zeuss, _Deutschen\r\n  und die Nachbar Stamme_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION II.—_Slavonian Mythology._\r\n\r\nThe Slavonians had a polytheistic religion, answering, in spirit, to\r\nthat of the other Indo-European nations; but as they had no mythic\r\nliterature, like Greece and Scandinavia, we are dependent for\r\ninformation upon popular ballads and superstitions, eked out by the\r\nnotices of missionaries and statements of conquerors; and it is not easy\r\nto perceive whether their myths were an independent branch of the\r\ngeneral stock, or only the Teutonic religion under another dress.\r\n\r\nThe divine word, in all the various nations, is Bog. It was used for\r\nGod, both in the old heathen times, and afterwards in its full sense,\r\nwhen Christianity became known to them. It enters into numerous names,\r\nboth before and after Christianity. The most noted is Bogislav, or God’s\r\nglory, which was borne by many a Pole and old Prussian; and, in 1627, it\r\nfinished off the old Slavonic line of dukes of Pomerania, from whom that\r\nstate came to the acquisitive house of Brandenburg. The historical\r\nLatinism of the name is Bogislaus; and it is still current in Illyria as\r\nBogosav.\r\n\r\nTheophilus is literally translated by Bogoljub or Bogoje in Illyria, and\r\nBohumil in Bohemia. This makes it probable that Robert Guiscard thence\r\ntook the name of his eldest son, Bohemond, giving it a Norman\r\ntermination. The mother is called Alvareda, and she is said to have been\r\ndivorced on the score of consanguinity; but it is not improbable that\r\nthis was a mere excuse of the wily duke of Calabria for ridding himself\r\nof an Illyrian wife. Bohemond is said to have been called after a giant\r\nof romance; but the giant has not as yet transpired, and may have been,\r\nafter all, a Slavonic divinity. Bohemond, or Boemondo, as Tasso calls\r\nhim, was the Ulysses of the first Crusade, and left a grandson namesake.\r\n\r\nTheodorus and Theodora are answered by Bogdan and Bogdana, both spelt\r\nwith _h_ in Bohemia—Bohdan, Bohdana, and in Illyria Bozidar, Bozidara;\r\nand, as has been already said, the Divine birth-night, Christmas, is\r\ncommemorated by Slovak children being called Bozo. Bogohval is Thank\r\nGod, Bogoboj, God’s battle, all names in use in Poland and the kindred\r\nnations before the general names of Europe displaced the native growth.\r\n\r\nThe word does not answer to either Deus or God, but is related to the\r\nSanscrit _bhagas_, destiny.\r\n\r\nThe word _ljube_, Love, is rather a favourite in the affectionate\r\nSlavonic nomenclature. At the outset of Bohemian history we come on the\r\nbeautiful legend of Queen Libussa, or the darling. She succeeded her\r\nfather in 618, governed alone for fourteen years, then, finding her\r\npeople discontented, sought the wisest man in her domains for a husband,\r\nand found him, like Cincinnatus, at the plough, when he not only\r\nretained his homely cloak, iron table, and bark sandals, as marks of his\r\norigin, but bade them be produced at all future royal elections. His\r\nname, Przemysl, or the thoughtful, was continued in his line, though\r\nchroniclers cut its dreadful knot of consonants by calling it Premislaus\r\nand the next ensuing namesake Germanized himself as Ottokar. He was\r\nafterwards elected king of Poland, where the name was used, with the\r\nfeminine Przemyslava.\r\n\r\nRussia has the feminine Ljubov, Love, fondly termed Lubuika, and, in\r\nfamilies where French is spoken, called Aimée, though this more properly\r\ntranslates Ljubka and Ljubnia. The Slovaks have Ljuboslav and its\r\nfeminine, and the Polish Lubomirsky is Peace-loving. The Russian Ljubov\r\nis chiefly used in allusion to the Christian grace of love; and Faith,\r\nor Vjera, and Hope, Nadezna, are both, likewise, very popular at the\r\npresent day, the latter usually Frenchified into Nadine; while the Serbs\r\nhave Nada, or Nadan.\r\n\r\nThe Slaves of Rugen had a terrible deity called Sviatovid, or the\r\nluminous, who was considered to answer to Mars, or Tyr, and had a temple\r\nat Acron, and an image with seven heads, which must have much resembled\r\nIndian idols. A white horse was sacred to him, and was supposed to be\r\nridden by him during the night, and to communicate auguries by the\r\nmanner in which it leaped over lances that were arranged in its path.\r\nHuman sacrifices were offered to this deity both in Rugen and Bohemia;\r\nand when his image was at length overthrown, St. Vitus, from the\r\nresemblance of sound, was confounded with him by the populace, and\r\nSvantovit, as they called both alike, was still the tutelary genius of\r\nthe place. Svetozor, Dawn of light, and Svetlana, a Russian lady’s name\r\nstill in use, are connected with light, the first syllable of his name.\r\n\r\nConjoined with Sviatovid, and lying on a purple bed in the temple in\r\nRugen, was the seven-headed Rugevid, or Ranovid (whose name is explained\r\nby reference to the Sanscrit _rana_, blood-thirsty); and likewise\r\nRadegost, the god of hospitality, from _rad_, prosperous, and _gose_, a\r\nguest, the word so often encountered. Several names began with the first\r\nsyllable—Rada, Radak, Radan, Radinko, Radmir, Radivoj, Radko, Radman,\r\nRadmil, Radoje, Radoslav; and the Illyrians have the hospitable name of\r\nGostomil, or Guest love: indeed, _gost_ forms the end of many Slavonic\r\nnames, in accordance with the ready and courteous welcome always offered\r\nby this people.\r\n\r\nDavor is another war god, whose name seems of very near kindred to\r\nMavors, or Mars, and who left Davorinn, Davroslav, and Davroslava, as\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nTikla was the old Slavonic goddess of good luck, and, being confounded\r\nwith St. Thekla, made this latter name popular in Poland, Russia, and\r\nHungary; and, in like manner, Zenovia, the huntress goddess, conduced to\r\nmake Zenobia, and Zizi, its contraction, common in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe fire god was Znitch; and though he does not show any direct\r\nnamesakes, yet there are sundry fire-names in his honour, such as the\r\nSlovak Vatroslav and Illyrian Ognoslav, both signifying fire glory.\r\nPossibly, too, the Russian Mitrofan may be connected with the old\r\nPersian _mithras_, or sacred fire; though in history it figures in Greek\r\necclesiastical guise, as the Patriarch Metrophanes.[150]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  Tooke, _Russia_; Eichioff, _Tableau de la Littérature du Nord au Moyen\r\n  Age_; Zeuss, _Deutschen und die Nachbar Stamme_; _Universal History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION III.—_Warlike Names._\r\n\r\nFew more Slavonic names remain to be mentioned, and these more for their\r\ncorrespondence with those of other races than for much intrinsic\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nVery few are known beyond their own limits. Stanislav, or Camp glory, is\r\nthe most universal, and is one of the very few found in the Roman\r\ncalendar, which has two Polish saints thus named. The first, Stanislav\r\nSczepanowski, Bishop of Cracow, was one of the many prelates of the\r\neleventh century who had to fight the battle of Church against king, and\r\nhe was happy in that his cause was that of morality as well as\r\ndiscipline. Having excommunicated King Boleslav for carrying off the\r\nwife of one of the nobles, he was murdered by the king in his own\r\ncathedral; and Gregory VII. being the reigning Pope, his martyrdom was\r\nan effectual seed of submission to the Church. The wretched king died by\r\nhis own hand, and the bishop became a Slavonian Becket, was enshrined at\r\nCracow, and thought to work miracles. His name was, of course, national,\r\nand was again canonized in the person of Stanislav Kostka, one of the\r\nearly Jesuits who guided the reaction of Roman Catholicism in Poland.\r\nThe name has even been used in France, chiefly for the sake of the\r\nfather of the Polish queen of Louis XV., and afterwards from the influx\r\nof Poles after the partition of their kingdom.\r\n\r\n     ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐\r\n     │   English.   │    French.   │ Portuguese.  │   Italian.   │\r\n     │Stanislaus    │Stanislas     │Estanislau    │Stanislao     │\r\n     ├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤\r\n     │   German.    │  Bavarian.   │   Polish.    │  Illyrian.   │\r\n     │Stanislav     │Stanes        │Stanislav     │Stanisav      │\r\n     │   ————————   │Stanisl       │Stach         │Stanko        │\r\n     │   Lettish.   │Stanel        │Stas          │              │\r\n     │Stanislavs    │Stanerl       │              │              │\r\n     │Stachis       │              │              │              │\r\n     └──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\nMuch in the same spirit is the Russian Boris, from the old Slavonian\r\n_borotj_, to fight. It has never been uncommon in Muscovy, and belonged\r\nto the brother-in-law of Ivan the Terrible, Boris Goudenoff, who was\r\nregent for his imbecile nephew Feodor; and, after assassinating the\r\nhopeful younger brother, Dmitri, reigned as czar, till dethroned by a\r\ncounterfeit Dmitri. Borka and Borinka are the contractions, and Borivor\r\nwas the first Christian duke of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBron, a weapon, forms Bronislav and Bronislava. Voj is the general\r\nSlavonic term for war, and is a very frequent termination. Vojtach, the\r\nPolish Vojciech, and Lithuanian Waitkus, all mean warrior.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious feature in nomenclature how strongly glory and fame are\r\nthe leading notion of the entire race, whose national title of glory has\r\nhad such a fall. _Slav_ is an inevitable termination; _voj_ almost as\r\nconstantly used; and even the tenderest commencements are forced to love\r\nwar, and to love fame. The old Russian Mstisslav glories in vengeance\r\n(_mest_), but is usually recorded as Mistislaus; Rostislav increases\r\nglory; Vratislav, Glowing glory, names not only the Wratislaus of\r\nhistory, but the city of Breslaw. The Slovak Vekoslav, and Vekoslava,\r\nare Eternal fame.\r\n\r\nThe two animals used in Slavonic names are warlike; Vuk, the wolf, and\r\nBravac, the wild boar; but both these are very possibly adopted from the\r\nGerman Wulf and Eber.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION IV.—_Names of Might._\r\n\r\n_Boleje_, strong or great, answers to the Teuton _mer_, and Boleslav is\r\ngreat glory. Boleslav Chrobry, the second Christian prince of Poland,\r\nwas a devout savage and great conqueror, both in Russia and Bohemia. He\r\nwas the first Pole to assume the title of king; and after his death, in\r\n1025, there are many instances of his name in both Poland and Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIn this latter country it had, however, a far more sinister fame.\r\nBorivor and Ludmilla, the first Christian prince and princess of that\r\nduchy, had two grandsons, Boleslav and Vesteslav, or Venceslav, the\r\nfirst a heathen, the latter a Christian. Boleslav stirred up the pagan\r\npopulation against his brother, and murdered him while praying in church\r\nat Prague, on the 28th of September, 644, thus conferring on him the\r\nhonour of a patron saint and centre of legends. The House of Luxemburg\r\nobtained the kingdom of Bohemia by marriage, and Venceslav was\r\nintroduced among their appellations in the form of Wenzel; and the crazy\r\nand furious Bohemian king of that name sat for a few unhappy years on\r\nthe imperial throne; but in spite of the odium of that memory, the name\r\nof good King Wenceslas, as we call it, held its ground, and contracts\r\ninto Vacslav and Vaclav. Some say that it is crown glory, from\r\n_vienice_; others deduce the prefix from _vest_, the superlative of\r\n_veliku_, great, which furnished the Bulgarian Velika, Veleslav,\r\nVelimir.\r\n\r\nThe familiar root that has been so often encountered in _valeo_,\r\n_wield_, &c., in the sense of power, gives the prefix _vlad_ to various\r\nfavourite Slavonic names. The Russian Vladimir, being of the race of\r\nRurik, is sometimes seized upon as Waldemar; and, in fact, there is\r\nlittle difference in the sense of the first syllable. He is a great\r\nnational saint, since it was his marriage with the Greek Princess Anna\r\nthat obtained for the Byzantine Church her mighty Muscovite daughter;\r\nand in honour of him, Vladimir has been perpetually used in Russia,\r\nshortened into Volodia, and expanded into Volodinka by way of\r\nendearment.\r\n\r\nThe national saint of Hungary was Vladislav, who was the restorer of the\r\nfaith that had almost faded away after the death of the sainted King\r\nStephen, and was chosen as leader of a crusade, which was prevented by\r\nhis death in 1095. His name, and that of his many votaries, have sorely\r\npuzzled Latin and Teutonic tongues; when not content, like the French,\r\nto term him St. Lancelot, his countrymen call themselves after him\r\nLaszlo, or Laczko, the Illyrians Lako, the Letts Wendis; but chroniclers\r\nvary between Uladislaus and Ladislaus in Hungary and Poland; and when\r\nthe Angevin connection brought down a king from Hungary to revenge the\r\ndeath of his brother upon Giovanni of Naples, the Italians called him\r\nLadislao; and as Ladislas we recognize the last native Hungarian king,\r\nbrother-in-law to Charles V. Vladislavka is a feminine, contracting into\r\nValeska, which is still borne by Polish young ladies. Vladivoj is\r\nanother of the same class, and _sve_, all, with the verb _vladati_, to\r\nrule, has formed Vsevolad and Svevlad, All ruler, and Vseslav, All fame.\r\n\r\nPossibly there may be some connection here with the deity Volos, Weles,\r\nor Veless, invoked under these names by the Slaves, Bohemians, and\r\nRussians, as witness of their oaths, and likewise as guardian of flocks.\r\nPossibly the Roman Pales may be the same deity under another form; but\r\nthe name of Volos is still applied to shepherds, and comes, no doubt,\r\nfrom the Slavonic _vlas_, or Russian _volos_, the same word as wool.\r\n\r\nThe word _mir_ at the end of Vladimir is somewhat doubtful. It may mean\r\npeace, or it may mean the world; and in like manner the Slovak Miroslav\r\nstands in doubt between world-fame or peaceful-fame.\r\n\r\nPurvan, Purvançe, is the Bulgarian _first_, whether used in the sense of\r\nchief or of first-born does not appear; but, at any rate, bearing a most\r\neastern sound with it.\r\n\r\nWe are familiar with the Russian _ukase_, from _ukasat_, to show forth;\r\nand _kaze_ in Polish has the same sense of command. Kazimir is thus\r\nCommand of peace, a noble title for a prince, and essentially national\r\nin Poland, where it was endeared by the fame of three of the best of the\r\nearlier sovereigns. It has the feminine Kasimira, and is one of the very\r\nfew Slavonic names used by Teutons. Intermarriages introduced it among\r\nthe German princes; and Johann Kasimir, a son of the Pfalzgraf of the\r\nRhine, was a noted commander in the war of the Revolt of the\r\nNetherlands, and received the Garter from Queen Elizabeth. He was\r\ncommonly called Prince Kasimir, and his namesakes spread in Germany; and\r\neither for the sake of the sound, or Polish sympathies, Casimir was\r\nsomewhat fashionable in France.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    French.    │    Polish.    │   Bohemian.   │   Lettish.    │\r\n   │Casimir        │Kazimir        │Kazimir        │Kasimirs       │\r\n   │    ——————     │Kazimierz      │               │Kasche         │\r\n   │    German.    │               │               │Kaschis        │\r\n   │Kasimir        │               │               │Kaschuk        │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n_Kol_, council, formed Koloman, somewhat noted in early Slavonic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n_Jar_, pronounced as beginning with _y_, means strength or firmness.\r\nJaromir, Firm peace, was prince of Bohemia in 999. Jaropolk, firm\r\ngovernment, was the last heathen grand prince of Muscovy; and this name,\r\nwith Jaroslav, is very frequent in the early annals of the House of\r\nRurik.\r\n\r\nFrom _lid_, the people, (our old friends _hleute_ and λαος,) came\r\nLjudomir and Ludmilla, who was the first Christian duchess in Bohemia,\r\nand was strangled by her heathen daughter-in-law, Dragotina, the mother\r\nof Boleslav and Venceslav, leaving a sainted name much used among all\r\nSlavonian women, and called at home Lida and Lidiska; in Russia,\r\nLjudmila. Lidvina was likewise Bohemian, from Vina, an old goddess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SECTION V.—_Names of Virtue._\r\n\r\nWords signifying goodness are far from uncommon in this class of\r\nnomenclature. _Dobry_, good, has a worthy family. Dobrija, sometimes\r\ncalled Dobrowka, was the Bohemian princess whose marriage, like those of\r\nClotilda, Bertha, and Anna, brought religion into her new country. Her\r\nhusband, Miczslav, of Poland, had been born blind, but recovered his\r\nsight at seven years old. He had seven wives while still a heathen, but\r\nwas told that he would have no children unless he began afresh with a\r\nChristian lady. He demanded the Czech princess. She brought St.\r\nAdalbert, of Prague, with her; and Mistislaus, as he is generally called\r\nin history, is counted as the first Polish Christian king, in the year\r\n970. So national was the name, that the Poles altered Maria of Muscovy\r\nto Dobrija, on her marriage with Kasimir, their king. The other names of\r\nthis commencement are Illyrian—Dobrogast, Dobroljub, Dobroslav, and its\r\nfeminine Dobrovoj, Dobrvok, Dobrutin, and Dobrotina, Good guest, Good\r\nlove, Good glory, Good war, Good wolf, and Beneficent.\r\n\r\n_Ssvätyj_, holy, and _polk_, government, are the component parts of the\r\nold Russian Sviatopolk, often found among the early race of Rurik. Holy\r\nglory, Sviatoslav, was the inappropriate name of the son of the\r\nChristian princess Olga, the same who refused baptism, believing that\r\nall the converts were cowards, and that he should lose the support of\r\nthe war gods and of his followers.\r\n\r\nThe Illyrian _blag_, good, makes Blagorod, Good birth, also, as usual,\r\nBlagovoj, Blagoslav, Blagodvor, Blagogost, and the contraction Blagoje.\r\n\r\n_Prav_ is upright, a connection, it may be, of _probus_, and it has\r\nformed the Slavonic Upravda, and the Illyrian Pravdoslav, Pravdoslava,\r\nPravoje. It is, perhaps, the same with the Wend _prib_, which formed the\r\nname Pribislava. The Danes amalgamated the Wend _pred_ into their own\r\nnames as Predbiorn, or Preban.\r\n\r\n_Çast_, or _cest_, is honour. The first letter, _ç_, should be\r\npronounced _z_; it is rather a favourite with Poland and Bohemia.\r\nÇastibog exactly answers to the Greek Timotheus, as does Çastimir to the\r\nmodern German Ehrenfried, very possibly a translation from it. Çastislav\r\nis the most popular form, like all else ending in _slav_, and has\r\nshortened into Çaslav, Çaislav, Cestislav, Ceslav.\r\n\r\nOf the same sound is the first letter of _çist_, pure, whence Çistav and\r\nÇistislav. From _tverd_, firm, we have Tverdko, Tverdimir, Tverdislav.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SECTION VI.—_Names of Affection._\r\n\r\nThe Slavonian nature has much in common with the Irish, and there is\r\nmuch of caressing and personal affection. _Ljub_, as has been seen, is a\r\nfavourite element in names, and _dragi_, dear, does a considerable part.\r\nDragomira, or Dear peace, was the name of the heathen mother of Boleslav\r\nand Venceslav. Dragoslav, or dear glory, is Russian, and Poland and\r\nBohemia have used Dragan, Draganka, Dragoj, Dragojila, Dragioila,\r\nDragnja, Dragotin, Dragotinka, Dragilika, Dragija.\r\n\r\n_Duschinka_ is the tender epithet which, in Russia, a serf applies to\r\nher lady in addressing her. It is properly the diminutive of Duscha,\r\nhappy, which is sometimes a Christian name in Russia, as well as in\r\nIllyria, where it is called Dusa and Dusica. _Stastny_ is the Bohemian\r\nword for happy, and is sometimes used as a name. Blazena, meaning happy,\r\nin these tongues, is used as the South Slavonic equivalent for Beatrice.\r\n\r\nAnother word for love is _mil_. Mila and Milica are the feminines,\r\nmeaning lovely, or amiable, Milan the masculine; but all these are now\r\nconfounded with the numerous progeny of the Latin Æmilius. _Mil_ is a\r\nfavourite termination, and is found loving war and glory—Milovoj and\r\nMiloslav.\r\n\r\nCedoljub and Cedomil are both most loving names, the first half of the\r\nname signifying a child, so that they signify ‘child-love,’ or ‘filial\r\naffection.’\r\n\r\nBrotherly love is likewise honoured as nowhere else, save in the Greek\r\nPhiladelphus, which exactly renders Bratoljub, from _brata_, a word of\r\nthe universal family likeness whence ἀδελφός and _hermano_ are the only\r\nnoted variations. Brajan and Bragican also belong to brotherhood.\r\n\r\n_Deva_ is a maiden, whence Devoslav and Devoslava, probably formed, or\r\nat least used, in honour of the Blessed Virgin.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SECTION VII.—_Names from the Appearance._\r\n\r\nA few names of extremely personal application exist, such as the Servian\r\nMrena, white in the eyes, and Mladen, young, and the highly\r\nuncomplimentary Illyrian Smoljan and Smoljana, from _smoljo_, an\r\noverhanging nose, probably a continuation of the nickname of some\r\nfavoured individual.\r\n\r\n_Krasan_, beautiful, however, was used in names, as Krasimir, Krasislav,\r\nKrasomil, &c.; and _zlata_, golden, though once used in Zlatoust, as a\r\nliteral translation of Chrysostomos, in other names may, it is hoped, be\r\nemployed to denote beauty; or else Zlatoljub, with its contractions\r\nZlatoje and Zlatko, would be a most avaricious name. Zlata, Zlatana,\r\nZlatibor, and Zlatislav, are also used.\r\n\r\n_Tiho_, silent, is a curious prefix. Tihomil, Silent love, and Tihomir,\r\nSilent peace, are clear enough; but Tihoslav, Silent glory, is a\r\npuzzling compound, probably only arising from the habit of ending\r\neverything with _slav_.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, however, that there is an entire absence of the names\r\nof complexion so common among the Kelts and Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n                          MODERN NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt still remains to cast a passing glance over the countries of the\r\nEuropean commonwealth, and observe the various classes of names that\r\nhave prevailed in them. It is only possible to do this, with my present\r\ninformation, very broadly and generally. In fact, every province has its\r\nown peculiar nomenclature; and the more remote the place the more\r\ncharacteristic the names, and, therefore, the most curious are the least\r\naccessible. It is the tendency of diffused civilization to diminish\r\nvariations, and up to a certain point, at least, to assimilate all to\r\none model, and this process for many years affected the educated and\r\naristocratic community, although latterly a desire for distinctiveness\r\nand pride in the individual peculiarities of race and family, have\r\narisen; but, on the other hand, the class below, which used to be full\r\nof individualities, has now reached the imitative stage, and is rapidly\r\nlaying aside all national and provincial characteristics, The European\r\nnobility, except where some old family name has been preserved as an\r\nheirloom, thus cease, about the sixteenth century, to bear national\r\nnames; but all are on one level of John, Henry, Frederick, Charles,\r\nLouisa, &c., while the native names come to light among citizens and\r\npeasants; but now, while the gentleman looks back for the most\r\ndistinctive name in his remote ancestry, and proudly bestows it on his\r\nchild, the mechanic or labourer shrinks from the remark and\r\nmisunderstanding that have followed his old traditional baptismal name,\r\nand calls his son by the least remarkable one he can find, or by one\r\nculled from literature. These remarks apply chiefly to England, but\r\nalso, in great measure, to the town population of France, and to all\r\nother places which are much affected by the universal fusion of national\r\nideas and general intercourse of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION I.—_Greece._\r\n\r\nModern Greece has the most direct inheritance from the ancient,\r\nclassical, and old Christian names. True, her population has undergone\r\nchanges which leave but little of the proud old Ionian or Dorian blood;\r\nbut her language has been victorious over the barbarous speech of her\r\nconquerors, and Latins and Bulgarians became Greek beneath her\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of her peninsulas and islands are, then, with few\r\nexceptions, called by Greek names. The exceptions are, in the first\r\nplace, in favour of the Hebrew names that are in universal use, not only\r\nthe never-failing Joannes and Maria, but Isaakos, David, Elias, and\r\nothers, for whom the Greek Church has inculcated more constant\r\nveneration than has the Latin. Next there are the few Latin names that\r\nwere accepted by the Greeks during the existence of the Byzantine\r\nempire, and either through martyrs or by favourite sovereigns,\r\nrecommended themselves to the love of posterity; but these are few in\r\nnumber, and Konstantinos is the only distinguished one. And, lastly, an\r\nextremely small proportion have been picked up by intercourse with the\r\nWestern nations, but without taking root.\r\n\r\nThe mass of Greek names belongs to the class that I have called ‘Greek\r\nChristian,’ being those that were chiefly current in the years of\r\npersecution and martyrdom—some old hereditary ones from ancient time,\r\nothers coined with the stamp of the Faith. These, with others expressive\r\nof favourite ideas, such as Macharios, Blessed, Sophia, Wisdom, Zoe,\r\nLife, were the staple of the Greeks until the modern revival brought\r\nforward the old heroic and historical names; and Achilles, Alkibiades,\r\nThemistokles, &c., are again in familiar use.\r\n\r\nIn a list of names used at the present day in the Ionian Islands, I find\r\nseventeen men and four women of the old historical and heroic class; the\r\nfour ladies being Kalliope, Arethusa, Euphrosyne, and Aspasia; and,\r\nperhaps, Psyche and Olympias ought to be added to these: twenty-three\r\nmale and nineteen female of the Christian Greek class: two Hebrew, _i.\r\ne._ Joannes and Jakobos, of men; three of women, Maria, Anna, and\r\nMartha. Paulos and Konstantinos, and perhaps Maura, alone represent the\r\nLatin, and Artorioos the Kelt, probably borrowed from some Englishman.\r\n\r\nSurnames are inherited from the Latin nomina, and began earlier in\r\nConstantinople than anywhere else. They are divided between the\r\npatronymic, ending, as of old, in _ides_, the local, and the permanent\r\nnickname.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION II.—_Russia._\r\n\r\nThe European portion of the vast empire of Russia is nationally\r\nSlavonic, but much mixed with Tatar; and the high nobility is descended,\r\nat least according to tradition, from the Norsemen. The royal line is,\r\nthrough intermarriages, almost Germanized. The Church continues the\r\nfaith, practice, and ritual of the Greek Church, but in the old Slavonic\r\ntongue, from which the spoken language has much deviated.\r\n\r\nThe Greek element greatly predominates in the nomenclature: native\r\nsaints have contributed a few Slavonic specimens, and a very few\r\ninherited from the Norsemen occur; but the race of Rurik seem very\r\nquickly to have adopted Russian names. The Tatar population hardly\r\ncontributes a Christian name to history, and the Germans almost always,\r\non their marriage with the Russian imperial family, assumed native, _i.\r\ne._ Greek or Roman-Greek, names. The present fashions in nomenclature\r\nare, however, best explained in the following letter from an English\r\nlady residing in Russia:—\r\n\r\n'Children (and grown-up persons in their own family) are, I may say,\r\nuniversally called by their diminutives. In society the Christian name\r\nand patronymic are made use of, and you seldom hear a person _addressed_\r\nby his family name, though he may be spoken of in the third person as\r\n“Romanoff,” or “Romanova” (surnames take the gender and number of their\r\nbearers), except by his superiors, such as a general to his young\r\nofficers, &c.\r\n\r\n'The patronymic is formed by the addition of _vitch_, or _evitch_, to\r\nthe Christian name of a person’s father; as Constantine Petrovitch,\r\nAlexander Andréevitch, in the masculine; and of _ovna_, or _evna_, in\r\nthe feminine, Olga Petrovna, Elizavetta Andréovna.\r\n\r\n'I would call your attention to the error that is generally made in the\r\nnewspapers, where these patronymics are spelt with a _W_, whereas they\r\nreally are spelt and pronounced with a _V_.\r\n\r\n'The diminutives can always be traced to the root, being derived from\r\nthe first, or the accented syllable, of the full name, with the\r\ntermination of a little fond syllable, _sha_, _ia_, _inka_, _otchka_,\r\n_oushka_; for instance, Mária, Másha, Mashinka—Olga, Olinka, Olitchka:\r\nIan, John, Vanoushka, Vanka—Alexandre, Alexandra, Sasha, Sashinka. Not\r\nin one diminutive are there such glaring differences of spelling and\r\nsound, as Dick for Richard, Polly for Mary, Patty for Martha.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it is not superfluous to mention, that there are diminutives of\r\nreproach as well as of affection; if you scold Olga, she becomes Olka;\r\nIvan, Vanka; and so on. This form, however, is seldom made use of by\r\nwell-educated people, except in fun; though there are some who do not\r\nhesitate to make free use of it in their kitchens and nurseries, in a\r\nprivate sort of a manner. Among the lower orders, and especially in the\r\ncountry, it is not considered reproachful, but is the general form of\r\nappellation. You observe, that this is formed by the addition of _ka_ to\r\nthe principal syllable.\r\n\r\n'I find, on attentive search in the “_Monument of Faith_,” a sort of\r\ndevotional book of prayer and meditations applied to every day of the\r\nyear, and with the names and a short-biography of each saint, that there\r\nare 822 men’s names and 204 women’s in the Russian calendar. Of these,\r\nyou will be surprised to hear twelve only are really Slavonic.\r\nUnfortunately I am unable to inform you of their meanings,\r\nnotwithstanding every inquiry among the few educated inhabitants of this\r\nlittle out-of-the-way town; but if ever I have an opportunity of seeing\r\na real “Sclavonophile,” as searchers into Russian antiquities are\r\ncalled, I will not fail to ask about it. The names are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  ‘1 Boris (_m._), grand duke; murdered in 1015.\r\n  ‘2 Gleb (_m._), brother to Boris; murdered in 1016.\r\n  ‘3 Vetcheslav (_m._), Duke Chetsky.\r\n  ‘4 Vladimir (_m._), grand duke; baptized in 988 (1st Christian grand\r\n  duke).\r\n  ‘5 Vsévolod (_m._), duke; he changed his name to Gabriel when\r\n  baptized; died in 1138.\r\n  ‘6 Igor (_m._), grand duke of Tchernigoff, 1147. (Norse.)\r\n  ‘7 Razóomnik (_m._); this name is taken from _rázoom_, which means\r\n  sense, wisdom, and signifies a wise, sensible person.\r\n  ‘8 Olga (_f._), grand duchess, god-mother to Vladimir. She was the\r\n  first Christian duchess. (Norse.)\r\n  ‘9 Ludmilla (_f._), god-mother to Vsevold, and martyred in the cause\r\n  of Christianity.\r\n  ‘10 Véra (_f._), means faith.\r\n  ‘11 Nadéjda (_f._), hope.\r\n  ‘12 Lubov, charity, love.\r\n\r\n‘All the other names are of Greek, Latin, or Hebrew origin (with a very\r\nfew exceptions, of which I will speak afterwards), and though they\r\ngenerally differ in termination, yet they are to be recognized\r\ninstantly. I observe that in Greek names _K_ is used, and not the sound\r\nof _S_, as in Kiril, Kiprian (Cyril, Cyprian). Also that _Th_ takes the\r\nsound of _F_, as Féodore, Fomá (Theodore, Thomas). But the _Th_ is\r\nrepresented by a letter distinct from that by which _Ph_ or _F_ are\r\nrepresented, the former being written Θ and the latter Ø, but both have\r\nexactly the same sound. _U_ sometimes becomes _V_ when used in the\r\nmiddle of names, as Evgenia (Eugenia), Evstafi (Eustace). _B_ in many\r\ninstances becomes _V_, as in Vasili (Basil), Varvara (Barbara),\r\nVarfolomey (Bartholomew).\r\n\r\n‘The names of other origin are very few, viz.:—\r\n\r\n                           'Avenir—Indian;\r\n                           Arisa—Arabian;\r\n                           Daria—Persian;\r\n                           Sadof—Persian;\r\n                           Erminigeld—Gothic.\r\n\r\n‘German names, I may say, are not to be found in the Russo-Greek\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\n‘When I say that there are 1026 Christian names in the calendar, I must\r\nexplain that the number of saints is infinitely greater; there being\r\nfrom two or three to twenty or thirty every day of the year, the 29th of\r\nFebruary included. There are sixty-one St. John’s days, thirty St.\r\nPeter’s, twenty-seven St. Féodor’s, twenty-four St. Alexandre’s,\r\neighteen St. Gregory’s, sixteen St. Vasili’s, twelve St. André’s, ten\r\nSt. Constantine’s, &c.\r\n\r\n‘Sometimes the same saint is fêted two or three times in the year, but\r\nthe different saints of the same name are very many. The female saints\r\nare in less number. Maria and Anna each occur ten times in the year,\r\nEuphrosinia six times, Féodora eight, and so on. In proportion to the\r\nnumber of saints so are the names of the population; so that Ivan is the\r\nmost common; next, I think, comes Vasili, André, Pëtre, Nicolas\r\n(Nikolâï), Alexandre.\r\n\r\n‘The lower orders have no idea of dates; they always reckon by the\r\nsaints’ days. Ask a woman the age of her baby, she will say, “Well, I\r\nsuppose it is about thirty weeks old.” “What is its name?” “Ivan.”\r\n“Which Ivan?” you ask, your calculations being defeated by the sixty-one\r\nSt. Johns. “Why, the Ivan that ‘lives’ four days after dirty Prascóvia.”\r\nYou then understand that the child must have been born about the 10th or\r\n12th October, as the blessed saint is irreverently called “dirty\r\nPrascóvia” from falling on the 14th October, a very muddy time of the\r\nyear in holy Russia.\r\n\r\n‘One name only can be given at baptism, and it must be taken from the\r\northodox calendar. German, French, and English names not to be found\r\nthere cannot be bestowed, nor can a surname, as in England.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECTION III.—_Italy._\r\n\r\nItaly, like Greece, has her classical inheritance. Her Lucio, Marco,\r\nTito, Giulio, bear appellations borne by their Oscan or Sabine\r\nforefathers, even before Rome was a city; but mingled with this ancient\r\nstream there have been such an infinite number of other currents, that\r\nno land has undergone more influences, or has a more remarkable variety\r\nof personal names.\r\n\r\nIn the decay of the Roman Empire, and the growth of the Church, the old\r\nprænomina were a good deal set aside, by the heathen in his search for\r\nheroic-sounding titles, by the Christian in his veneration for the\r\nmartyrs and saints of his Church. So the prosaic matter-of-fact\r\nthree-storied name of the Roman was varied by importations, generally of\r\nChristian Greek, but now and then of heroic Greek; and as the Christian\r\nelement predominated, the Hebrew apostle or prophet suggested the name\r\nof the young Roman. Barbarians, acquiring rights of citizenship, ceased\r\nto adopt the nomen of their patron, retaining appellations that a Scipio\r\nor Cato would have thought only fit to be led in a triumph, but still\r\nputting on a Latin finish and regarding them as Roman. But\r\nthese—disgraceful as they are now regarded—were the days that stamped\r\nthe Roman impress on the world, and marked the whole South of Europe\r\nwith an indelible. print of Latin civilization and language.\r\n\r\nGoths, Vandals, Gepidæ, and Lombards came on northern Italy one after\r\nthe other; and the Lombards established a permanent kingdom that deeply\r\ninfluenced the north of the peninsula and Teutonized its nobility. The\r\ntowns were less open to their influence; and Venice remained the Roman\r\nand partly Byzantine city she was from her source—using a language where\r\nher _g_ is still the Greek ζ, and christening her children by the names\r\nof later Rome in its Christian days, only with the predominance of the\r\nnational saint, Marco, the guardian of the city ever since his bones\r\nwere stolen from Alexandria. The recurring _ano_, or _ani_, of Venetian\r\nsurnames is the adoptive _anus_ of Rome—republican Rome—whose truest\r\nrepresentative the merchant city was till her shameful degradation and\r\nfinal ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Italian element in the population of Cisalpine Gaul continued far\r\ntoo strong for the Lombardic conquerors, and ere long had taught them\r\nits own language. If they wrote, it was in their best approach to\r\nclassical Latin; when they spoke, it was in the dialectic Latin of the\r\nprovinces farther broken by the inability of the victors to learn the\r\ncase terminations, which were settled by making, in the first\r\ndeclensions, all the singular masculines end in _o_, and plurals in _i_,\r\nall the feminines in _a_ and _e_; in the others, striking a balance and\r\ncalling all _ite_. But though the speech was Latin, the Lombard kept his\r\nold Teutonic name—Adelgiso, Astolfo, or the like, and handed it on to\r\nhis son, softened, indeed, but with its northern form clearly traceable.\r\nTime went on, and the Lombardic kingdom was fused into the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire. The towns remained self-governing, self-protecting old Roman\r\nmunicipalities; the Lombardic nobles, if they had a strong mountain\r\nfastness, lived like eagles in their nests and were the terror of all;\r\nif they had but a small home on the plains, were forced to make terms\r\nwith the citizens and accept their privileges as a favour. Thus came the\r\nTeuton element into the cities, and old Lombardic names were borne by\r\nFlorentine and Milanese citizens. The Roman nomina so far were preserved\r\nthat a whole family would be called after its founder, whether by his\r\nname or nickname. The noted man might be originally Giacopo, but called\r\nLapo for short. His children were, collectively, Lapi; a single one\r\nwould be either Bindo Lapo, or, latterly, _dei Lapi_, one of the Lapi.\r\nSometimes office gave a surname, as Cancelliero, when the family became\r\nCancellieri. One of these Cancellieri was twice married; and one of the\r\nwives being yclept Bianca, her children were called Bianchi; their\r\nhalf-brothers Neri, merely as the reverse; and thence arose the two\r\nfamous party words of the Guelfs of Florence. Latterly, when these names\r\nin _i_ were recognized as surnames, it was usual to christen a boy by\r\nthe singular, and thus we have Pellegrino Pellegrini, Cavaliere\r\nCavalieri, and many other like instances, familiar to the readers of\r\nDante and of old Italian history. Dante’s own names—the first contracted\r\nfrom a Latin participle, the second the direct patronymic from his\r\nfather—Alighiero, the Teutonic noble spear, form a fit instance of the\r\nmixed tongue, which he first reduced to the dignity of a written\r\nlanguage. Those were its days of vigour and originality; of fresh\r\nname-coining from its own resources,—Gemma, Fiamma, Brancaleone,\r\nVinciguerra, Cacciaguido—words not merely of commonplace tradition, but\r\noriginal invention.\r\n\r\nMeantime southern Italy had been under other influences. Long remaining\r\na province of the Eastern empire, Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily were the\r\nmarauding ground of the Saracens, till the gallant Norman race of\r\nHauteville came to their deliverance, and imposed on them a\r\nNorman-French royalty and nobility, with their strange compound of\r\nFrench and Northern names—Robert and Roger, Tancred and William,\r\nFerabras and Drogo, the latter certainly Frank, as it belonged to an\r\nillegitimate son of Charlemagne. It was brought to England by Dru de\r\nBaladon, a follower of the Conqueror; and we find it again in Sir Drew\r\nDrury, the keeper of Mary of Scotland. It may be related to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _dry_, a sorcerer, and _dreist_, the German skilful, but its\r\nderivation is uncertain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Norman influence waned, the Swabian power gave a few German\r\nnames to the Two Sicilies, but was less influential than either the\r\nFrench in Naples or the Aragonese in Sicily, where the one strewed\r\nCarlo, the other Fernando and Alfonso.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Christian name was the prominent one, more used and\r\nesteemed than titles throughout all ranks. Men and women would be simply\r\nspoken of as Giovanni or Beatrice, or more often, by contractions, Vanni\r\nor Bice, Massuccio, or Cecca, now and then with Ser or Monna (signor or\r\nmadonna) added as titles of respect.\r\n\r\nAll the time, what may be called the Roman Catholic influence on\r\nnomenclature was growing in its great centre. The city of martyrs was\r\nfilled with churches where the remains of the saint gave the title, and\r\nwas thought to give the sanctity, and these suggested names to natives\r\nand pilgrims alike. Cecilia, Sebastiano, Lucia, &c., and more than can\r\nbe enumerated, won their popularity from owning a church that served as\r\na station in the pilgrimages, and thus influenced the world. Relics\r\nbrought to Rome, and then bestowed as a gift upon princes, carried their\r\nsaints' epithets far and wide; and when Constantinople was in her decay,\r\nand purchased the aid of Western sovereigns by gifts of her sacred\r\nstores, the Greek and Eastern saints had their names widely diffused, as\r\nAnna, Adriano, &c. Moreover, the feasts of different events in the life\r\nof the Blessed Virgin Mary began to tell on Italian names, and\r\nAnnunciata, and later, Assunta, were the produce.\r\n\r\nFrancesco is the most universal name of native Italian fabrication. It\r\nis one of what may be called the names spread by religious orders, all\r\nof which originate in Italy; Benedetto, oldest of all and universal in\r\nRomanist lands; Augustino, never very popular; Domenico, not uncommon in\r\nItaly, but most used in gloomy Spain; Francesco and Clara, both really\r\nuniversal in Protestant as well as Roman Catholic lands.\r\n\r\nThe revival of classical literature, produced partly by the influx of\r\nGreek scholars after the fall of Constantinople, partly by the vigour of\r\nBoccaccio and Petrarch, brought a classical influence to bear on Italy,\r\nof which her names are more redolent than those elsewhere. Emilia,\r\nVirgilio, Olimpia, Ercole, Fabrizio, all arose and flourished in Italy,\r\nand have never since been dropped, though the Romanist influence has\r\ngone on growing, and others have affected parts of the country.\r\n\r\nRomance had some influence—Orlando, Oliviero, Rinaldo, Ruggiero—and the\r\nmore remote Lancilotto, Ginevra, Isolda, Tristano, all became popular\r\nthrough literature; and the great manufacture of Italian novels, no\r\ndoubt, tended to keep others in vogue.\r\n\r\nThe French and German wars in Italy, the erection of the Lombardic\r\nrepublics into little tyrannical duchies, and the Spanish conquest of\r\nNaples, all tended to destroy much of the individuality of Italian\r\nnomenclature, and reduce that of the historical characters to the\r\ngeneral European level. And this tendency has increased rather than\r\ndiminished, as Spain devoured the North, and ‘balance of power’\r\nstruggled for Austrian interests, and established Bourbon kingdoms and\r\nduchies. The old national names were not utterly discarded; there was\r\nstill a Lombardic flavour in the North, a classical one in the old\r\ncities, a Norman one in Sicily; but the favourite commonplace names\r\npredominated in the noblesse, and titles began to conceal them.\r\nMoreover, the women were all Maria, and many of the men likewise; and\r\nthe same rule at present holds good, though of late the favourites have\r\nbecome Filomena and Concetta—in honour, the one of the new saint, the\r\nother of the new dogma of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe House of Savoy, which is just now the hope of Italy, always had its\r\nown peculiar class of names—Humbert, Amé, Filiberto, Emanuele, Vittore,\r\nand these are likely to become the most popular in liberal Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION IV.—_Spain._\r\n\r\nSpain has many peculiarities of her own, to which I would fain do\r\ngreater justice than is in my power. Celtiberian at first, she seems to\r\nhave become entirely Latin, except in those perplexing Basque provinces,\r\nwhere the language remains a riddle to philologists. One Spanish name is\r\nclaimed by Zamacola as Basque, _i. e._ Muño, with its feminine Muña, or\r\nMunila; and for want of a more satisfactory history, one is inclined to\r\nsuppose that Gaston, or Gastone, must be likewise Basque. It first comes\r\nto light as Gascon among the counts of Foix and Béarn, from whom the son\r\nof Henri IV. derived it, and made it French.\r\n\r\nRome Latinized the Spanish speech for ever, and left many an old Latin\r\nname, which, however, went on chiefly among the lower orders, while the\r\nSuevi and the Goths ruled as nobles and kings, bringing with them their\r\nTeutonic names, to be softened down to the dignified Romance tongue,\r\nwhich took the Latin accusative for its stately plurals in _os_ and\r\n_es_. It is likely that the Latin element was working upwards at the\r\ntime of the Mahometan conquest, since the traitor Julian, his daughter\r\nFlorinda, the first patriot king, Pelayo, all have classically derived\r\nnames; and some of these occur in the early royal pedigrees of the\r\nAsturias and Navarre, and the lords of Biscay, as these small mountain\r\nterritories proclaimed their freedom and Christianity. Here we find\r\nSancho (Sanctus), Eneco (Ignatius), Lope, Manse, Fortunio, Adoncia,\r\nTeresa, Felicia, all undoubtedly Latin and Greek; and curiously, too,\r\nhere are the first instances of double Christian names, probably the\r\nremnant of the Latin style. Eneco Aristo, Inigo Sancho, Garcias Sancho,\r\nand the like, are frequent before the year 1000; and the Cid’s enemy,\r\nLain Calvo, is supposed to be Flavius Calvus. The Goths, however, left a\r\nfar stronger impression on the nomenclature than on the language.\r\nAlfonso, Fernando, Rodrigo, Berengario, Fruela, Ramiro, Ermesinda, are\r\nundoubtedly theirs; but other very early names continue extremely\r\ndoubtful, such as Ximen and Ximena, Urraca, Elvira, or Gelvira, Alvaro,\r\nBermudo, Ordoño, Velasquita, all appearing in the earliest days of the\r\nlittle Christian kingdoms, though not in the palmy times of the Gothic\r\nmonarchy. These names have been already mentioned, with the derivations\r\nto which they may possibly belong; but they are far from being\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for. The simple patronymic _ez_ was in constant\r\nuse, and formed many surnames.\r\n\r\nAs the five kingdoms expanded and came into greater intercourse with\r\nEurope, the more remarkable names gradually were discarded; but Alfonso,\r\nFernando, Rodrigo, Alvar, Gonzalo, were still national, and the two\r\nfirst constantly royal, till the House of Trastamare brought Enrique and\r\nJuan into fashion in Castille. The favourite saint was James the Great,\r\nor, more truly, Santiago de Compostella, in honour of whom Diego and his\r\nson Diaz are to be found in very early times. Maria, too, seems to have\r\nbeen in use in Spain sooner than elsewhere, and Pedro was in high favour\r\nin the fourteenth century, as it has continued ever since.\r\n\r\nAragon and Portugal had variations from the Castillian standard of\r\nlanguage; and Portugal now claims to have a distinct tongue, chiefly\r\ndistinguished by the absence of the Moorish guttural; and in\r\nnomenclature, by the close adherence to classic spelling, and by the\r\nterminations which would in Spanish be in _on_, or _un_, being in _aŏ_,\r\nthe contraction of _nho_. Aragonese has been absorbed in Castillian, and\r\nCatalan is only considered as a dialect.\r\n\r\nAfter Aragon and Castille had become united, and, crushing the Moors and\r\ndevouring Navarre, were a grand European power, their sovereigns lost\r\nall their nationality. French, or rather Flemish, Charles, and Greek\r\nPhilip, translated as Carlo and Felipe, reigned on their throne as the\r\nHouse of Austria, while the native Fernando went off to be the German\r\nFerdinand. Isabel, the Spanish version of either Jezebel, or Elizabeth,\r\ndid retain her popularity, but hardly in equal measure with the\r\nuniversal Maria; and as the Inquisition Romanized the national mind more\r\nand more, the attribute names of Mercedes and Dolores, and even the\r\nidolatrous Pilar, and Guadalupe, from a famous shrine, were invented.\r\nThese were given in conjunction with Maria, and used for convenience'\r\nsake. Literary names seem to have been few or none, and the saint, or\r\nrather the Romanist, nomenclature, was more unmitigated in Spain and her\r\ngreat western colonies than anywhere else; even in Italy, where the\r\nclassics and romance always exerted their power. In the Spanish\r\ncolonies, even divine names are used, without an idea of profanity.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Christian name in speech has, however, never been\r\ndropped, even under the French influence of the Bourbon monarchy; and\r\nDon Martin, Doña Luisa, &c., would still be the proper title of every\r\nSpanish gentleman or lady.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish names that have spread most extensively have been Fernando\r\nin Germany, Iñigo and Teresa throughout all Roman Catholic countries,\r\nfor the sake of the two Spanish saints who revived their old\r\nhalf-forgotten sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECTION V.—_France._\r\n\r\nFrance, the most influential of European countries for evil or for good,\r\ncan hardly be properly spoken of as _one_, in nation or language. Yet\r\nthat one dialect of hers that has contrived to be the most universal\r\ntongue of Europe, that character, which by its vivacity and earnestness,\r\nand, perhaps, above all, by its hard, rigid consistency, has impressed\r\nits ideas on all other nations, and too often dragged them in its wake,\r\nthough both only belonging to a fraction of the population, are still,\r\nin general estimation, _the_ French, and their importance undeniable.\r\nDislike, despise, struggle as we will, we are still influenced, through\r\nimitation and vanity, and the deference of the weaker majority, in\r\nmatters of conventional taste.\r\n\r\nOld Gaul had its brave Keltic inhabitants, and its race in Brittany,\r\nunsubdued by even Rome, were only united to the rest of the country by\r\nthe marriage of their heiress, only subdued by gradual legalized\r\ntampering with their privileges. Even in the Keltic province, however,\r\ngenuine Keltic names are nearly gone; though Hervé, Guennolé, Yvain,\r\nArzur, are still found in their catalogues; and in France, Généviève, by\r\nher protection of Paris, left her ancient name for perpetual honour and\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nThe Roman overflow came early and lasted long; it left a language and\r\nmanners strongly impressed, and the names seem to have been according to\r\nLatin forms and rules. Dionysius, Pothinus, Martinus, Hilarius, are all\r\nfound among the Gauls in the end of the Roman sway; and when the Franks\r\nhad burst over the country and held the north of the Loire, whenever a\r\nGaul comes to the surface, he is called by a Roman name—Gregorius,\r\nSidonius Apollinaris, Germanus, Eligius.\r\n\r\nSouthern Gaul was, indeed, never Frank. The cities were Roman\r\nmunicipalities, shut their gates, and took what care of themselves they\r\ncould; while the Hlodvehs and Meervehs, the Hilperics, and Hildeberts\r\nravaged over the stony country, which still called itself Provincia. And\r\nthere, though Burgundians on the east, and Goths from the Pyrenees,\r\ngradually contrived to erect little dukedoms and counties, and hold them\r\nunder the empire established by Charlemagne, the country was still\r\npeopled by the Romanized Gaul, and the _Langue d’oc_ was spoken and\r\nsung. This was the centre of the softened classic names, Yolande and\r\nConstance, Alienor and Delphine, while the legends of St. Marthe and of\r\nthe Martyrs of Lyons supplied provincial saints. The rich literature,\r\nchiefly of amatory songs, died away, and the current remains of the\r\nlanguage are now unwritten, falling further and further into patois, and\r\nvarying more from one another. One of its curious peculiarities is to\r\nmake _o_ a feminine termination; Dido is there short for Marguerite,\r\nZino for Theresine, &c.\r\n\r\nA great number of French surnames are still Roman, such as Chauvin\r\n(Calvinus), Godon (Claudius), Marat, Salvin, and many more, showing that\r\nLatin nomenclature must long have been prevalent among the mass of the\r\npeople, though as history is only concerned with the court, we hear\r\nchiefly of the Franks around the unsteady thrones of Neustria and\r\nAustrasia. The High German of these kingdoms, as used by the Meerwings,\r\nwas extremely harsh; Hlodveh and Hlodhild, Hlother and Hlodvald, were\r\ntheir rough legacies; but, despised as was the name and cheap the blood\r\nof the Roman among them, his civilization was conquering his victors;\r\nand when the Karlings, with their middle class cultivation, subdued the\r\neffete line of Meerveh, they spoke Latin as freely as Frankish, and the\r\nnames they bore had softened; Ludovicus and Lotharius, Carolus and Emma\r\nin Latin, or in German, Ludwe and Lothar, Karl and Emme. And now, among\r\nthe many saints that were fostered by the religious government and\r\nmissionary spirit of Frankland, arose the founders of the chief stock\r\nnames of Europe—Robert, Richard, Henry, Williaume, Walther, Bernard,\r\nBertram, Eberhard, and the like.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the next generation, Germany, Lorraine, and France fell apart,\r\nthe latter country was beginning to speak the _Langue d’oui_, retaining\r\nthe Latin spelling, but disregarding it in speech, as though the scholar\r\nhad written correctly, but the speaker had disregarded the declension,\r\nand dropped the case endings alike of Latin and Teutonic. And so Karl\r\nwas Charles, and Lodwe Louis, long before the counts of Paris, with\r\ntheir assimilation of the Cymric Hu to the Teuton Hugur, had thrust the\r\nKarlings down into Lorraine, and commenced the true French dynasty in\r\ntheir small territory between the Seine and Loire.\r\n\r\nAlready had the Northmen settled themselves in Neustria, and, taking the\r\nbroken Frank names and mangled Latin speech for badges of civilization\r\nand Christianity, had made them their own, and infused such vigour into\r\nthe French people, that from that moment their national character and\r\nliterature begin to develop.\r\n\r\nThen it was that France exercised a genuine and honourable leadership of\r\nEurope. Her language being the briefest form of Latin, was, perhaps, the\r\nmost readily understood of the broken Romance dialects; and though Rome\r\nhad the headship of the Church, and Germany the nominal empire of the\r\nWest, France had the moral chieftainship.\r\n\r\nThe Pope did but sanction the Crusades; it was France that planned them.\r\nFrenchmen were the connecting link between the Lorrainer Godfrey, the\r\nNorman Robert, the Sicilian Tancred, the Provençal Raymond, the Flemish\r\nBaldwin. The kingdom of Jerusalem, though founded by the Lorrainer, was\r\nessentially French; the religious orders of knighthood were chiefly\r\nFrench; the whole idea and language of chivalry were French; and perhaps\r\nrightly, for France has at times shown that rare and noble spirit that\r\ncan exalt a man for his personal qualities, instead of his rank, even in\r\nhis own lifetime. The nation that could appreciate its St. Bernard, its\r\nDu Guesclin, its Bayard, deserved, while that temper was in it, to be a\r\nleader of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nEngland was in these earlier days regarded as a foreign and\r\nsemi-barbarous realm held by a French duke or count, while southern\r\nFrance was divided into independent fiefs of the empire. The names began\r\nto be affected by reverence for saints, and fast included more and more\r\nof the specially popular patrons, such as Jean, Jaques, Simon, Philippe.\r\nThey became common to all the lands that felt the central crusading\r\nimpulse, and the daughters of French princes, Alix, Matilde, the\r\nProvençal Constance, Alienor, Isabel, Marguérite, were married into all\r\nparts of Europe, and introduced their names into their new countries,\r\noften backed up by legends of their patrons.\r\n\r\nNormandy lapsed to France through King John’s crime and weakness, and\r\nthe persecution of the Albigenses, and the narrower views of the popes,\r\nchanged the Crusades to a mere conquest of the _Langue d’oc_ by the\r\n_Langue d’oui_, completed by the marriages of the brothers of St. Louis;\r\nand though Provence continued a fief of the empire, and the property of\r\nthe Angevin kings of Naples, yet their French royal blood united it more\r\nclosely to the central kingdom, and the transplanting of the papal court\r\nto Avignon, gave a French tinge to the cardinalate which it only\r\nrecovered from at the expense of the Great Schism.\r\n\r\nPhilippe le Bel was the last able sovereign of France of the vigorous\r\nearly middle ages; but the brilliant character of the nobility still\r\ncarried men’s minds captive, and influenced the English even through the\r\ncentury of deadly wars that followed the accession of the House of\r\nValois, and ended by leaving Louis XI. king of the entire French soil.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing century was that when the influence of France on other\r\nnations was at the lowest ebb. Exhausting herself first by attacks on\r\nItaly, and then by her savage civil wars, she required all the ability\r\nof Henri IV. and of Richelieu to rouse her from her depression, and make\r\nher be respected among the nations. Meantime, her nomenclature had\r\nvaried little from the original set of names in use in the tenth\r\ncentury; dropping a few obsolete ones, taking up a few saintly ones,\r\nrecommended by fresh relics, and occasionally choosing a romantic one,\r\nbut very scantily; François was her only notable adoption. The habit of\r\nmaking feminines to male names seems to have spread in France about the\r\neighteenth century, rather narrowing than widening the choice. Jeanne\r\nseems to have been the first to undergo this treatment; Philippine was\r\nnot long after, then Jacqueline, and, indeed, it may have been the\r\nhabit—as it is still among the peasantry of the South—always to give the\r\nfather’s name to the eldest child, putting a feminine to it for a girl.\r\n\r\nWith the cinque-cento came a few names of literature, of which Diane was\r\nthe most permanent; and the Huguenots made extensive use of Scripture\r\nnames—Isaac, Gédéon, Benjamin, and many more; but the Christian name was\r\nquickly falling out of fashion. People were, of course, christened, but\r\nit is often difficult to discover their names. The old habit of\r\naddressing the knight as Sire Jehan, or Sire Pierre, and speaking of him\r\nas _le Beau Sieur_, had been entirely dropped. Even his surname was\r\noften out of sight, and he was called after some estate—as le Sieur\r\nPierre Terrail was to the whole world Chevalier Bayard. Nay, even in the\r\nsignature, the Christian name was omitted, unless from some very urgent\r\nneed of distinction. Henri de Lorraine, eldest son of the duke of Guise,\r\nsigns himself Le Guisard in a letter to the Dauphin Henri, son of\r\nFrançois I. Married ladies wrote themselves by their maiden joined to\r\ntheir married title, and scarcely were even little children in the\r\nhigher orders called by one of the many names that it had become the\r\ncustom to bestow on them, in hopes of conciliating as many saints and as\r\nmany sponsors as possible,—sometimes a whole city, as when the\r\nFronde-born son of Madame de Longueville had all Paris for his\r\ngodmother, and was baptized Charles Paris.\r\n\r\nNow and then, however, literature, chiefly that of the ponderous\r\nromances of the Scudéry school, influenced a name, as Athenaïs or\r\nSylvie; but, in general, these magnificent appellations were more used\r\nas sobriquets under which to draw up characters of acquaintances than\r\nreally given to children. Esther is, however, said to have been much\r\npromoted by the tragedy of Racine.\r\n\r\nThe Bourbons, with their many faults, have had two true kings of men\r\namong them—Henri IV. and Louis XIV.—men with greatness enough to stamp\r\nthe Bourbon defects where their greatness left no likeness.\r\n\r\nThere is something very significant in the fact, that these were the\r\ndays when it was fashionable to forget the simple baptismal name. There\r\nwas little distinction in it, if it had been remembered; Louis or Marie\r\nalways formed part of it, with half-a-dozen others besides. As to the\r\npopulace, nobody knows anything of them under Louis XIV.: they were\r\nground down to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe lower depth, under Louis XV., brought a reaction of simplicity; but\r\nit was the simplicity of casting off all trammels—the classicalism of\r\nthe Encyclopædists. Christian names are mentioned again, and were chosen\r\nmuch for literary association. Emile and Julie, for the sake of\r\nRousseau; and, from Roman history, Jules and Camille, and many another,\r\nclipped down to that shortened form by which France always appropriated\r\nthe words of other nations, and often taught us the same practice.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution stripped every one down to their genuine two names, and\r\nwoe to the owners of those which bore an aristocratic sound, or even\r\nmeaning. Thenceforth French nomenclature, among the educated classes and\r\nthose whom they influence, has been pretty much a matter of taste.\r\nDevotion, where it exists, is satisfied by the insertion of Marie, and\r\nanything that happens to be in vogue is added to it. Josephine\r\nflourished much in the first Bonaparté days; but Napoléon was too\r\nimperial, too peculiar, to be given without special warrant from its\r\nowner; nor are politically-given names numerous: there are more taken\r\nfrom popular novels or dramas, or merely from their sound. Zephyrine,\r\nCoralie, Zaidée, Zénobie, Malvine, Séraphine, prevail not only among the\r\nladies, but among the maid-servants of Paris; and men have, latterly,\r\nbeen fancifully named by appellations brought in from other countries,\r\nnever native to France—Gustave, Alfred, Ernest, Oswald, &c. Moreover,\r\nthe tendency to denude words of their final syllable is being given up.\r\nThe names in _us_ and in _a_ are let alone, in spelling, at least; and\r\nsome of our feminine English contractions, such as Fanny, have been\r\nabsolutely admitted.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, very little affects the peasantry, or the provinces.\r\nPatron saints and hereditary family names, contracted to the utmost, are\r\nstill used there; and a rich harvest might be gathered by comparison of\r\nthe forms in Keltic, Latin, Gascon, or German, in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VI.—_Great Britain._\r\n\r\nThe waning space demands brevity; otherwise, the appellations of our own\r\ncountrymen and women are a study in themselves; but they must here be\r\ntreated of in general terms, rather than in detail.\r\n\r\nThe Keltic inhabitants of the two islands bore names that their\r\ndescendants have, in many instances, never ceased to bear and to\r\ncherish. The Gael of Ireland and Scotland have always had their Niel and\r\nBrighd, their Fergus and Angus; Aodh, Ardh, and Bryan, Eachan, Conan,\r\nthe most ancient of all traditional names, continuing without interval\r\non the same soil, excepting a few of the more favoured Greek and old\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\nThe Cymry, in their western mountains, have a few equally permanent.\r\nCaradoc, Bronwen, Arianwen, Llud, and the many forms of Gwen, are\r\nextremely ancient, and have never dropped into disuse. In both branches\r\nof the race there was a large mass of poetical and heroic myth to endear\r\nthese appellations to the people; and it is one of the peculiar features\r\nof our islands to be more susceptible than any other nation to these\r\ninfluences on nomenclature. Is it from the under-current of the\r\nimaginative Kelt that this tendency has been derived?\r\n\r\nRome held England for four hundred years; and though Welsh survived her\r\ngrasp and retained its Keltic character, instead of becoming a Romance\r\ntongue, it was considerably imbued with Latin phraseology; and the\r\nassumption of Latin names by the British princes, with the assimilation\r\nof their own, has left a peculiar class of Welsh classic names not to be\r\nparalleled elsewhere, except, perhaps, in Wallachia. Cystenian, Elin,\r\nEmrys, Iolo, Aneurin, Ermin, Gruffydd, Kay, are of these; and there are\r\nmany more, such as March, Tristrem, Einiawn, Geraint, which lie in doubt\r\nbetween the classic and the Cymric, and are, probably, originally the\r\nlatter, but assimilated to those of their Latin models and masters. It\r\nwas these Romanized Kelts who supplied the few martyrs and many saints\r\nof Britain; whose Albanus, Aaron, and Julius left their foreign names to\r\nBritish love, and whose Patricius founded the glorious missionary Church\r\nof Ireland, and made his name the national one. His pupils, Brighde and\r\nColumba, made theirs almost equally venerated, though none of these\r\nsaintly titles were, at first, adopted in the Gadhaelic Churches without\r\nthe reverent prefix _Gille_, or _Mael_, which are compounded with all\r\nthe favourite saintly names of the Keltic calendar.\r\n\r\nAgain, the semi-Roman Kelts were the origin of the Knights of the Round\r\nTable. Arthur’s own name, though thorough Keltic, is claimed by Greek.\r\nLancelot is probably a French version of the Latin translation of\r\nMaelgwn; and the traces of Latin are here and there visible in the\r\nnomenclature of the brave men who, no doubt, aimed rather at being Roman\r\ncitizens than mediæval knights.\r\n\r\nThe great Low German influx made our island English, and brought our\r\nveritable national names. An immense variety existed among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, consisting of different combinations, generally with some\r\nfavourite prefix, in each family—_Sige_, _Æthel_, _Ead_, _Hilde_,\r\n_Cuth_, _Ælf_, and the terminations, generally, _beorht_, _red_, _volf_,\r\n_veald_, _frith_, or, for women, _thrythe_, _hilde_, _gifu_, or _burh_.\r\nThe like were in use in the Low German settlements on the Continent,\r\nespecially in Holland and Friesland.\r\n\r\nChristianity, slowly spreading through the agency of the Roman Church on\r\nthe one hand and the Keltic on the other, did not set aside the old\r\nnames. It set its seal of sanctity on a few which have become our\r\ngenuine national and native ones. Eadward, Eadmund, Eadwine, Wilfrith,\r\nÆadgifu, Æthelthryth, Mildthryth, Osveald, and Osmund, have been the\r\nmost enduring of these; and Æthelbyrht we sent out to Germany, to come\r\nback to us as Albert.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Danish invasions are traceable rather in surnames\r\nthan Christian names. The permanent ones left by them were chiefly in\r\ninsular Scotland and Ireland. Torquil, Somerled, Ivor, Ronald, Halbert,\r\nare Scottish relics of the invaders; and in Ireland, Amlaidh, Redmond,\r\nUlick.\r\n\r\nBut it was the Normans, Norsemen in a French dress, that brought us the\r\nFrench rather than Frank names that are most common with us. Among the\r\nthirty kings who have reigned since the Conquest, there have been ten\r\nChristian names, and of these but two are Saxon English, three are\r\nNorman Frank, two French Hebrew, one French Greek, one French, one\r\nAnglicized German Greek. Strictly speaking, Richard is Saxon, and began\r\nwith a native English saint; but it was its adoption by Normans that\r\nmade it popular after the Conquest; and it came in company with William,\r\nHenry, Robert, Walter, Gilbert, all in perpetual use ever since.\r\nAlberic, Bertram, Baldwin, Randolf, Roger, Herbert, Hubert, Reginald,\r\nHugh, Norman, Nigel, and many others less universally kept up, came at\r\nthe same time; and Adelheid and Mathilda were imported by the ladies;\r\nbut, in general, there were more men’s names than women’s then planted,\r\nprobably on account of William’s policy of marrying Normans to English\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nScripture names were very few. There are only two Johns in Domesday\r\nBook, and one is a Dane; but the saints were beginning to be somewhat\r\nfollowed; Eustace was predominant; Cecily, Lucy, Agnes, Constance, were\r\nalready in use; and in the migration, Brittany contributed Tiffany, in\r\nhonour of the Epiphany. At the same time she sent us her native Alan,\r\nBrian, and Aveline; and vernacular French gave Aimée and afterwards\r\nAlgernon.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of contractions. Between English and French, names were\r\noddly twisted; Alberic into Aubrey, Randolf into Ralph, Ethelthryth into\r\nAwdry, Eadgifu into Edith, Mathilda into Maude, Adelheid into Alice.\r\n\r\nSaint and Scripture names seem to have been promoted by the crusading\r\nimpulse, but proceeded slowly. The Angevins brought us the French\r\nGeoffrey and Fulk, and their Provençal marriages bestowed on us the\r\nProvençal version of Helena—Eleanor, as we have learnt to call their\r\nAlienor, in addition to the old Cymric form Elayne. Thence, too, came\r\nIsabel, together with Blanche, Beatrice, and other soft names current in\r\npoetical Provence. Jehan, as it was called when Lackland bore it, and\r\nits feminine Jehanne, seem to have been likewise introductions of our\r\nAquitanian queen.\r\n\r\nThe Lowland Scots had been much influenced by the Anglo-Saxons, whose\r\ntongue prevailed throughout the Lothians; and after the fall of Macbeth,\r\nand the marriage of Malcolm Ceanmore, English names were much adopted in\r\nScotland. Cuthbert has been the most lasting of the old Northumbrian\r\nclass. The good Queen Margaret, and her sister Christian, owed their\r\nGreek names, without a doubt, to their foreign birth and Hungarian\r\nmother, and these, with Alexander, Euphemia, and George, forthwith took\r\nroot in Scotland, and became national. Probably Margaret likewise\r\nbrought the habit, then more eastern than western, of using saintly\r\nnames, for her son was David; and from this time seems to have begun the\r\nfashion of using an equivalent for the Keltic name. David itself,\r\nbeloved for the sake of the good king, is the equivalent of Dathi, a\r\nname borne by an Irish king before the Scottish migration. David I.,\r\nnearly related to the Empress Maude, and owning the earldom of\r\nNorthumbria in right of his wife, was almost an English baron; and the\r\nintercourse with England during his reign and those of his five\r\nsuccessors, made the Lowland nobles almost one with the Northumbrian\r\nbarons, and carried sundry Norman names across the border, where they\r\nbecame more at home than even in England; such as Alan, Walter, Norman,\r\nNigel, and Robert.\r\n\r\nHenry II. was taking advantage of the earl of Pembroke’s expedition to\r\nIreland, and the English Pale was established, bringing with it to Erin\r\nthe favourite Norman names, to be worn by the newly-implanted nobles,\r\nand Iricized gradually with their owners. Cicely became Sheelah;\r\nMargaret, Mairgreg; Edward, Eudbaird; and, on the other hand, the Irish\r\ndressed themselves for civilization by taking English names. Finghin\r\nturned to Florence, and Ruadh to Roderick, &c.\r\n\r\nHenry III. had been made something like an Englishman by his father’s\r\nloss of Normandy; and in his veneration for English saints, he called\r\nhis sons after the two royal saints most beloved in England, Edward and\r\nEdmund; and the death of the elder children of Edward I. having brought\r\nthe latter a second time to the throne, it was thenceforth in honour.\r\nThomas owed its popularity to Becket, who was so christened from his\r\nbirth on the feast of the Apostle, St. Thomas, and, in effect, saintly\r\nnames were becoming more and more the fashion. Mary was beginning to be\r\nesteemed as the most honourable one a woman could bear; and legends in\r\nquaint metrical English rendered Agnes, Barbara, Katharine, Margaret,\r\nand Cecily well known and in constant use.\r\n\r\nThe romances of chivalry began to have their influence. Lionel and\r\nRoland, Tristram, Ysolda, Lancelot, and Guenever, were all the produce\r\nof the revival of the tales of Arthur’s court, arrayed in their feudal\r\nand chivalrous dress, and other romances contributed a few. Diggory is a\r\nhighly romantic name, derived from an old metrical tale of a knight,\r\nproperly called D'Egaré, the wanderer, or the almost lost, one of the\r\nmany versions of the story of the father and unknown son. Esclairmonde\r\ncame out of _Huon de Bourdeaux_; Lillias, such a favourite in Scotland,\r\ncame out of the tale of Sir Eger, Sir Graham, and Sir Graysteel; Lillian\r\nout of the story of Roswal and Lillian; and Grizel began to flourish\r\nfrom the time Chaucer made her patience known.\r\n\r\nThe Scots, by their alliance with France, were led to import French\r\nterminations, such as the diminutives Janet and Annot; also the foreign\r\nCosmo, and perhaps likewise Esmé.\r\n\r\nMeantime we obtained fresh importations from abroad. Anne came with the\r\nQueen of Richard II.; Elizabeth from the German connections of Elizabeth\r\nWoodville’s mother, Jaquetta of Luxemburg; Gertrude was taken from\r\nGermany; Francis and Frances caught from France; and Arthur was revived\r\nfor his eldest son by the first Tudor; Jane instead of Joan began, too,\r\nin the Tudor times.\r\n\r\nBut when the Reformation came, the whole system of nomenclature received\r\na sudden shock. Patron saints were thrown to the winds; and though many\r\nfamilies adhered to the hereditary habits, others took entirely new\r\nfashions. Then, Camden says, began the fashion of giving surnames as\r\nChristian names; as with Guildford Dudley, Egremont Ratcliffe, Douglas\r\nSheffield; and in Ireland, Sidney, as a girl’s name, in honour of the\r\nlord deputy, Sir Henry, the father of Sir Philip, from whom, on the\r\nother hand, Sydney became a common English boy’s name.\r\n\r\nThen, likewise, the classical taste came forth, and bestowed all manner\r\nof fanciful varieties; Homer, Virgil, Horatius, Lalage, Cassandra,\r\nDiana, Virginia, Julius, &c., &c., all are found from this time forward;\r\nand here and there, owing to some ancestor of high worth, specimens have\r\nbeen handed on in families.\r\n\r\nThe more pious betook themselves to abstract qualities; Faith, Hope,\r\nCharity, Prudence and Patience, Modesty, Love, Gift, Temperance, Mercy,\r\nall of which, even to the present day, sometimes are used, but chiefly\r\nby the peasantry, or in old Nonconformist families.\r\n\r\nBetween the dates 1500 and 1600 began the full employment of Scripture\r\nnames, chosen often by opening the Bible at haphazard, and taking the\r\nfirst name that presented itself, sometimes, however, by juster\r\nadmiration of the character. Thus began our use of Abraham and Sarah,\r\nIsaac and Rebecca, Rachel, Joseph, Benjamin, Josiah, Gershom, Gamaliel,\r\n&c.; and others more quaint and peculiar. The Puritan clergy absolutely\r\nobjected to giving unedifying names. A minister was cited before\r\nArchbishop Whitgift for refusing to christen a child Richard. The Bible\r\nwas ransacked for uncommon names only found in the genealogies, and\r\nparish registers show the strangest varieties, such as Hope still, Dust\r\nand Ashes, Thankful, Repent, Accepted, Hold-the-Truth, &c. These were\r\nchiefly given at the baptisms in the latter days of Elizabeth and the\r\nreign of James I. They were the real, not assumed, names of the\r\nIronsides, but they were not perpetuated. A man called Fight-against-Sin\r\nwould have too much pity for his son to transmit such a name to him.\r\nOriginal is, however, a family name still handed on in Lincolnshire.\r\nProbably it was at first Original Sin. The most curious varieties of\r\nnames were certainly used in the 17th century. The register of the\r\nscholars admitted to Merchant Taylors' school between 1562 and 1699\r\nshows Isebrand, Jasper, Jermyn, Polydore, Cæsar, Olyffe, Erasmus, Esme,\r\nUrsein, Innocent, Praise, Polycarpe, Tryamour, and a Sacheverell,\r\nFilgate, admitted in 1673.\r\n\r\nComparatively few of these Puritan names were used in Scotland; but\r\nseveral were for sound’s sake adopted in Ireland as equivalents;\r\nJeremiah for Diarmaid; Timothy for Tadhgh; Grace for Graine.\r\n\r\nCharles was first made popular through loyalty to King Charles I., who\r\nhad received it in the vain hope that it would be more fortunate than\r\nthe hereditary James, itself brought into Scotland seven generations\r\nback by a vow of Annaple Drummond, mother of the first unfortunate\r\nJames. English registers very scantily show either Charles or James\r\nbefore the Stuart days, but they have ever since been extremely popular.\r\nHenrietta, brought by the French queen, speedily became popular, and\r\nwith Frances, Lucy, Mary, Anne, Catherine, and Elizabeth, seem to have\r\nbeen predominant among the ladies; but all were contracted, as Harriet,\r\nFanny, Molly, Nanny, Kitty, Betty. The French suppression of the\r\nChristian name considerably affected the taste of the Restoration;\r\nnoblemen dropped it out of their signature; the knight’s wife discarded\r\nit with the prefix Dame; married daughters and sisters were mentioned by\r\nthe surname only; young spinsters foolishly adopted Miss with the\r\nsurname instead of Mistress with the Christian; but the loss was not so\r\nuniversal as in France, for custom still retained the old titles of\r\nknights and of the daughters and younger sons of the higher ranks of the\r\nnobility. The usual fashion was, in imitation of the French, for ladies\r\nto call themselves and be addressed in poetry by some of the Arcadian or\r\nromantic terms, a few of which have crept into nomenclature; Amanda,\r\nOphelia, Aspasia, Cordelia, Phyllis, Chloe, Sylvia, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe love of a finish in _a_ was coming in with Queen Anne’s Augustan\r\nage. The soft _e_, affectionate _ie_ or _y_, that had been natural to\r\nour tongues ever since they had been smoothed by Norman-French, was\r\ntwisted up into an Italian _ia_: Alice must needs be Alicia; Lettice,\r\nLetitia; Cecily, Cecilia; Olive, Olivia; Lucy, Lucinda; and no heroine\r\ncould be deemed worthy of figuring in narrative without a flourish at\r\nthe end of her name. Good Queen Anne herself had an _a_ tacked on to\r\nmake her ‘Great Anna’; Queen Bess must needs be Great Eliza; and Mary\r\nwas erected into Maria; Nassau had lately been invented for William\r\nIII.’s godchildren of both sexes; and Anne, after French precedent, made\r\nmasculine for his successor’s godsons. Belinda, originally the property\r\nof the wife of Orlando, was chosen by Pope for his heroine of _Rape of\r\nthe Lock_; Clarissa was fabricated out of the Italian Clarice by\r\nRichardson; and Pamela was adopted by him out of Sir Philip Sidney’s\r\n_Arcadia_, as a recommendation to the maid-servant whom he made his\r\nheroine; and these, as names of literature, all took a certain hold.\r\nPamela is still not uncommon among the lower classes.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the House of Brunswick had brought in the regnant names\r\nof German taste—George, of which, thanks to our national patron, we had\r\nalready made an English word, Frederick, Ernest, Adolphus—a horrible\r\nEnglish Latinism of good old German, Augustus, an adoption of German\r\nclassic taste; and, among the ladies, generally clumsy feminines of\r\nessentially masculine names—Caroline, Charlotte, Wilhelmina, Frederica,\r\nLouisa, together with the less incorrectly formed Augusta, Sophia, and\r\nAmelia.\r\n\r\nThis ornamental taste flourished, among the higher classes, up to the\r\nsecond decade of the nineteenth century, when the affectations, of which\r\nit was one sample, were on the decline, under the growing influence of\r\nthe chivalrous school of Scott, and of the simplicity upheld by\r\nWordsworth. The fine names began to grow vulgar, and people either\r\nbetook themselves to the hereditary ones of their families, or picked\r\nand chose from the literature then in fashion.\r\n\r\nTwo names, for the sake of our heroes by sea and land, came into\r\nprominence—Horatio and Arthur, the latter transcending the former in\r\npopularity in proportion to the longer career and more varied\r\nexcellences of its owner. Womankind had come back to their Ellen, Mary,\r\nand Lucy; and it was not till the archaic influence had gone on much\r\nlonger that the present crop sprang up, of Alice and Edith, Gertrude,\r\nFlorence, and Constance, copied again and again, in fact and in fiction,\r\nand with them the Herbert and Reginald, Wilfrid and Maurice, formerly\r\nonly kept up in a few old families. It is an improvement, but in most\r\ncases at the expense of nothing but imitation, the sound and the fashion\r\nbeing the only guides. After all, nomenclature cannot be otherwise than\r\nimitative, but the results are most curious and interesting, when it is\r\neither the continuation of old hereditary names, like the Algernon of\r\nthe Howards or the Aubrey of the de Veres, or else the record of some\r\ndeeply felt event, like the Giustina of Venice, in honour of the battle\r\nof Lepanto, or our own Arthur, in memory of the deeds of our great duke.\r\n\r\nNames are often an index to family habits and temper. Unpretending\r\nhouseholds go on for generations with the same set, sometimes adopting\r\none brought in by marriage, but soon dropping it out if it is too fine.\r\nRomantic people reflect the impressions of popular literature in their\r\nchildren’s names; enthusiastic ones mark popular incidents,—Navarino,\r\nMaida, Alma, have all been inflicted in honour of battles. Another class\r\nalways have an assortment of the fashionable type—Augusta, Amelia, and\r\nMatilda, of old; Edith and Kate at present.\r\n\r\nNonconformity leaves its mark in its virtue names and its Scripture\r\nnames, the latter sometimes of the wildest kind. Talithacumi was the\r\ndaughter of a Baptist. A clergyman has been desired to christen a boy\r\n‘Alas,’ the parents supposing that ‘Alas! my brother,’ was a call on the\r\nname of the disobedient prophet. There is a floating tradition of ‘Acts’\r\nbeing chosen for a fifth son, whose elder brothers had been called after\r\nthe four Evangelists; and even of Beelzebub being uttered by a godfather\r\nat the font.\r\n\r\nAmong other such names may be mentioned ‘Elibris,’ which some people\r\npersisted belonged to their family, for it was in their grandfather’s\r\nbooks: and so it was, being _e libris_ (from the books), the old Latin\r\nmanner of commencing an inscription in a book. Sarsaparilla was called\r\nfrom a scrap of newspaper. ‘Valuable and serviceable’ is also said to\r\nhave been intended for a child, on the authority of an engraving in an\r\nold watch; and an unfortunate pair of twins were presented for the\r\nimposition of Jupiter and Orion, because their parents thought them\r\npretty names, and ‘had heard on them.’\r\n\r\nDouble names came gradually in from the Stuart days, but only grew\r\nreally frequent in the present century; and the habit of calling girls\r\nby both, now so common among the lower classes in towns, is very recent.\r\n\r\nWith many families it is a convenient custom to christen the sons by the\r\nmother’s maiden name in addition to their first individual name; but the\r\nwhole conversion of surnames into Christian names is exclusively\r\nEnglish, and is impossible on the Continent, as state and church both\r\nrefuse to register what is not recognized as in use. Of English surnames\r\nwe need say nothing; they have been fully treated of in other works, and\r\nas any one may be used in baptism, at any time, the mention of them\r\nwould be endless.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of England we include not only our colonies but America.\r\nThere our habits are exaggerated. There is much less of the hereditary;\r\nmuch more of the Puritan and literary vein. Scripture names, here\r\nconspicuous, such as Hephzibah, Noah, Obadiah, Hiram, are there\r\ncommon-place. Virtues of all kinds flourish, and coinages are sometimes\r\nto be found, even such as ‘Happen to be,’ because the parents happened\r\nto be in Canada at the time of the birth.\r\n\r\n           ‘Peabody Duty perhaps keeps a store,\r\n           With washing tubs, and wigs, and wafers stocked;\r\n           And Dr. Quackenbox proclaims the cure\r\n           Of such as are with any illness docked:\r\n           Dish Alcibiades holds out a lure\r\n           Of sundry articles, all nicely cooked;\r\n           And Phocion Aristides Franklin Tibbs,\r\n           Sells ribbons, laces, caps, and slobbering-bibs.’\r\n\r\nThe Roman and Greek influence has been strong, producing Cato, Scipio,\r\nLeonidas, &c.; but the habit of calling negroes by such euphonious\r\nepithets has rather discouraged them among the other classes, and the\r\nromantic, perhaps, predominates with women, the Scriptural with men. The\r\nFrench origin of many in the Southern States, and the Dutch in New\r\nEngland, can sometimes be traced in names.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SECTION VII.—_Germany._\r\n\r\nWhat was said of Frankish applies equally to old High German, of which\r\nFrankish was a dialect, scarcely distinguishable with our scanty sources\r\nof information.\r\n\r\nWe have seen Frankish extinguished in Latin in the West; but in the East\r\nwe find it developing and triumphing. The great central lands of Europe\r\nwere held by the Franks and Suevi, with the half civilized Lombards to\r\ntheir south, and a long slip of Burgundians on the Rhine and the Alps,\r\nall speakers of the harsh High German, all Christians by the seventh\r\ncentury, but using the traditional nomenclature, often that of the\r\n_Nibelungenlied_. The Low Germans, speaking what is best represented by\r\nAnglo-Saxon literature, were in the northerly flats and marshes, and\r\nwere still heathens when the Franks, under Charlemagne conquered them,\r\nand the Anglo-Saxon mission of Boniface began their conversion.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of Charles by the pope was intended to establish the\r\nheadship of a confederacy of sovereigns, one of them to be the Kaisar,\r\nand that one to be appointed by the choice of the superior ones among\r\nthe rest. This chieftainship remained at first with the Karlingen; but\r\nafter they had become feeble it remained, during four reigns, with the\r\nhouse of Saxony, those princes who established the strange power of the\r\nempire over Italy, and held the papal elections in their hands. It was\r\nunder them that Germany became a confederation, absolutely separate from\r\nher old companion France.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to say of German nomenclature. She little varied her\r\nold traditional names. Otto, Heinrich, and Konrad, constantly appeared\r\nfrom the first; and the High German, as the literary tongue, has had the\r\nmoulding of all the recognized forms.\r\n\r\nThe Low German continued to be spoken, and became, in time, Dutch and\r\nFrisian, as well as the popular dialect of Saxony and West Prussia. The\r\nFrisian names are, indeed, much what English ones would be now if there\r\nhad been no external influences.\r\n\r\nIn spite of being the central empire, the German people long resisted\r\nimprovement and amalgamation. The merchant cities were, indeed, far in\r\nadvance, and the emperors were, of necessity, cultivated men, up to the\r\nordinary mark of their contemporary sovereigns; but the nobility\r\ncontinued surly and boorish, little accessible to chivalrous ideas, and\r\ntheir unchanging names—Ulrich, Adelbert, Eberhard, marking how little\r\nthey were affected by the general impressions of Europe. A few names,\r\nlike Wenceslav, or Boleslav, came in by marriage with their Polish,\r\nBohemian, and Hungarian neighbours; and Hungary, now and then, was the\r\nmedium of the introduction of one used at Constantinople, such as\r\nSophia, Anne, Elisabeth, which, for the sake of the sainted Landgraffinn\r\nof Thuringia, became a universal favourite. Friedrich came in with the\r\nSwabian dynasty; Rudolf and Leopold, with the house of Hapsburg.\r\n\r\nHolland and the cluster of surrounding fiefs meanwhile had a fluctuating\r\nsuccession, with lines of counts continually coming to an end, and\r\nothers acceding who were connected with the French or English courts.\r\nThe consequence was, that the gentlemen of these territories gained a\r\nstrong French tinge of civilization, especially in Flanders, where the\r\nWalloons were a still remaining island of Belgæ. The Flemish chivalry\r\nbecame highly celebrated, and, under the French counts of Hainault and\r\nFlanders, and dukes of Burgundy, acquired a tone, which made their names\r\nand language chiefly those of France, and tinctured that of the\r\npeasantry and artisans, so as to distinguish them from the Hollanders.\r\nAndreas, Adrianus, Cornelius, saints imported by the French dukes, were\r\nboth in Holland and the Netherlands, however, the leading names,\r\ntogether with Philip, which was derived from the French royal family.\r\nThe Dutch artificers and merchants had their own sturdy, precise,\r\nbusiness-like character—their German or saintly names, several of which\r\nare to be found among our eastern English, in consequence of the\r\nintercourse which the wool trade established, and the various\r\nsettlements of Dutch and Flemish manufacturers in England.\r\n\r\nThe revival of classical scholarship in the fifteenth century was\r\nconsiderably felt in the great universities of the Netherlands and of\r\nGermany, and its chief influence on nomenclature is shown in the\r\nintroduction of classical names; namely, Julius and Augustus, and the\r\nEmperior Friedrich’s notable compound of Maximus Æmilianus into\r\nMaximilian, but far more in finishing every other name off with the\r\nLatin _us_. Some were restorations to the original form; Adrianus,\r\nPaulus, and the ever memorable Martinus; but others were adaptations of\r\nvery un-Latin sounds. Poppo turned to Poppius; Wolf to Wolfius; Ernst to\r\nErnestus; Jobst, instead of going back to Justinus, made himself\r\nJobstius; Franz, Franciscus. The surnames were even more unmanageable,\r\nbeing often either nicknames or local; but they underwent the same fate;\r\nPott was Pottus; Bernau, Bernavius; while others translated them, as in\r\nthe already-mentioned instance of Erasmus, from Gerhardson, and the\r\nwell-known transformation of Schwarzerd into Melancthon. The Danish\r\nantiquary Broby (bridge town), figures as Pontoppidan; Och became Bos;\r\nHeilman, Severtus; Goldmann, Chrysander; Neumann, Neander; and as to the\r\ntrades, Schmidt was Faber; Müller, Molitor; Schneider, Sartorius;\r\nSchuster, Sutorius; Kellner, Cellarius.\r\n\r\nThe German Christian names did not permanently retain this affectation;\r\nbut the Netherlanders, owing probably to the great resort to their\r\nuniversities, retained it long and in popular speech, so that in many\r\nDutch contractions, the _us_ is still used, as in Janus for Adrianus;\r\nRasmus for Erasmus; and almost always the full baptismal name includes\r\nthe classical suffix. The surnames, of course, adhered, and are many of\r\nthem constantly heard in Germany and Holland, while others have come to\r\nEngland chiefly with the fugitives from the persecution that caused the\r\nrevolt of the Netherlands. The Latin left in Dacia and long spoken in\r\nHungary must have assisted to classicalize the Germans even on their\r\nSlavonic side.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation did not so much alter German as English nomenclature.\r\nThe Lutherans, following their master’s principle of altering only what\r\nwas absolutely necessary, long retained their hereditary allegiance to\r\ntheir saints, and did not break out into unaccustomed names, though they\r\nmodified the old Gottleip into Gottlieb. Some of their sects of Germany\r\nhowever, invented various religious names; Gottseimitdir, Gottlob,\r\nTraugott, Treuhold, Lebrecht, Tugendreich, and probably such others as\r\nErdmuth and Ehrenpreis were results of this revival of native\r\nmanufacture. A few Scriptural names came up among the Calvinists, but do\r\nnot seem to have taken a firm hold.\r\n\r\nThis was the land of the double Christian name. It was common among the\r\nprinces of Germany, before the close of the fifteenth century, long\r\nbefore France and Italy showed more than an occasional specimen. It was\r\nprobably necessitated, by way of distinction, by the large families all\r\nof the same rank in the little German states. They seem to have set the\r\nfashion which has gradually prevailed more and more in Europe; indeed,\r\nthere are some double names that have so grown together as to be\r\nrecognized companions, such as Annstine for Anne Christine, Anngrethe\r\nfor Anne Margarethe. At present it is the custom in almost all royal\r\nfamilies to give the most preposterous number of Christian names, of\r\nwhich one, or at most two, is retained as serviceable, &c.\r\n\r\nA few Slavonic names crept in; chiefly Wenzel from Bohemia; Kasimir from\r\nthe Prussian Wends; Stanislas from Poland; and the house of Austria,\r\nwhen gaining permanent hold of the empire, spread the names derived from\r\ntheir various connections; the Spanish Ferdinand, and Flemish Karl and\r\nPhilipp, besides their hereditary Leopold and Rudolf, and invented\r\nMaximilian.\r\n\r\nThe counter-reformation brought the Jesuit Ignaz and Franz into the\r\nlands where the Reformation was extinguished, and canonized Stanislav.\r\nUnder the horrors of the Thirty Years' War, Germany retrograded in every\r\nrespect; and when she began to emerge from her state of depression, the\r\nbrilliance of the French court rendered it her model, which she followed\r\nwith almost abject submission. Every one who could talked French, and\r\nwas called by as French a name as might be; the royal Fritz became\r\nFédéric, and little Hanne, Jeannette, the French _ine_ and _ette_ were\r\nliberally tacked to men’s names to make them feminine, and whatever\r\npolish the country possessed was French.\r\n\r\nThis lasted till the horrors of the Revolution, and the aggressions that\r\nfollowed it, awoke Germany to a sense of her own powers and duties as a\r\nnation. Her poets and great men were thoroughly national in spirit; and\r\nthough, after the long and destructive contest, she emerged with her\r\ngrand Holy Roman Empire torn to shreds, her electoral princes turned\r\ninto petty kings, her noble Hanse towns mostly crushed and absorbed in\r\nthe new states, her Kaisar merely the Markgraf of Austria, enriched by\r\nthe spoils of Lombardy and the Slavonic kingdoms, yet she had recovered\r\nthe true loyalty to the fatherland and its institutions, cared again for\r\nher literature and her language, and had an enthusiasm for her own\r\nantiquities, a desire to develop her own powers.\r\n\r\nGerman names, to a degree, reflect this. They have ceased to ape Latin\r\nor French. So far as any are literary, they come from their own national\r\nliterature; but as in most of the states only ordinary names are\r\nregistered, the variety is not great. More and more German names pass to\r\nEngland in each generation, and become naturalized there; but the same\r\nproportion of English do not seem to be returned.\r\n\r\nBavaria, having been always Roman Catholic, has more saintly names than\r\nmost other parts of Germany, and, in particular, uses those of some of\r\nthe less popular apostles, who probably have been kept under her notice\r\nby the great miracle plays.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, once part of the empire, though free for five hundred years\r\nback, is a cluster of varying tongues, races, languages, and\r\nreligions,—Kelt and Roman, Swabian and Burgundian, Romanist, Lutheran,\r\nCalvinist, German, French, Italian. Names and contractions must vary\r\nhere; but only those on the German side have fallen in my way, those\r\nabout Berne, which are chiefly remarkable for the Ours and Ursel, in\r\nhonour of the bears, and Salome among the women; the diminutive always\r\nin _li_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SECTION VIII.—_Scandinavia._\r\n\r\nGrand old Northmen! They had their own character, and never lost it;\r\nthey had their own nomenclature, and kept it with the purity of an\r\nunconquered race.\r\n\r\nThe few influences that affected their nomenclature were, in the first\r\nplace, in some pre-historic time, the Gaelic. Thence, when Albin and\r\nLochlinn seem to have been on friendly terms, they derived Njal, Kormak,\r\nKylan, Kjartan, Mælkoln, and, perhaps, Brigitte. Next, in Denmark, a few\r\nWend names were picked up; and, in fact, Denmark being partly peopled by\r\nAngles, and always more exposed, first to Slavonic, and then to German\r\ninfluences, than the North, has been less entirely national in names.\r\n\r\nIn the great piratical days the Northmen and Danes left their names and\r\npatronymics to the northern isles, from Iceland to Man, and even in part\r\nto Neustria and Italy. Oggiero and Tancredi, in the choicest Italian\r\npoems, are specimens of the wideness of their fame. Our own population,\r\nin the north-east of England, is far more Scandinavian than Anglian, and\r\nbears the impress in dialect in manners, and in surnames, though the\r\nbaptismal ones that led to them are, in general, gone out of use.\r\n\r\nChristianity did not greatly alter the old northern names, though it\r\nintroduced those of the universally honoured saints. But the clergy\r\nthought it desirable—and chiefly in Denmark—to take more ecclesiastical\r\nnames to answer to their own; so Dagfinn was David; Sölmund, Solomon;\r\nSigmund, Simon; and several ladies seem to have followed their example,\r\nso that Astrida and Griotgard both became Margarethe, and Bergliot\r\nBrigitte.\r\n\r\nThe popular nomenclature has included all the favourite saints with the\r\nindividual contractions of the country. The royal lines have been\r\ninfluenced by the dynasties that have reigned. Gustaf grew national in\r\nSweden after the disruption of the union of Calmar, and Denmark\r\nalternated between Christiern and Friedrich; but the main body of the\r\npeople are constant to Olaf and Eirik, Ingeborg and Gudrun; and in the\r\nNorwegian valleys the old immediate patronymic of the father is still in\r\nuse. Linnea as a feminine from Linnæus, the Latinism of their great\r\nnatural historian’s surname is a modern invention. Linne itself means a\r\nlime tree.\r\n\r\nThe Northmen have hitherto been the most impressing, and least impressed\r\nfrom without, of all the European nations; and thus their names are the\r\ngreat key to those of the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SECTION IX.—_Comparative Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nBefore entirely quitting our subject, it may be interesting to make a\r\nrapid comparison of the spirit of nomenclature, and the significative\r\nappellations that have prevailed most in each branch of the civilized\r\nfamily which we have been considering.\r\n\r\nFor instance—of religious names, the Hebrew race alone, and that at a\r\ncomparatively late period, assumed such directly Divine appellations, as\r\nEli, Elijah, Adonijah, Joel. The most analogous to these in spirit would\r\nbe the heathen Teutonic ones, Osgod, Asthor, Aasir; but these were,\r\nprobably, rather assertions of descent than direct proclamations of\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nThe very obvious and appropriate Gift of God is in all branches save the\r\nKeltic.\r\n\r\n   ┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n   │    Hebrew.    │    Greek.     │   Teutonic.   │   Persian.    │\r\n   │Jonathan       │Theodoros      │Godgifu        │Megabyzus      │\r\n   │Elnathan       │Dorotheus      │Gottgabe       │   _i.e._      │\r\n   │Nathanael      │  ——————————   │    (late)     │Bagabukhsha    │\r\n   │Mattaniah      │    Latin.     │  ——————————   │               │\r\n   │Nethaniah      │  Adeodatus    │   Slavonic.   │               │\r\n   │               │    (late)     │Bogdan         │               │\r\n   └───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\nServant of God is everywhere but among Latins and the Slaves.\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │  Hebrew.   │   Greek.   │ Teutonic.  │  Keltic.   │ Sanscrit.  │\r\n   │Obadiah     │Theodoulas  │Gottschalk  │Giolla-De   │Devadasa    │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nGreek and Gaelic likewise own the Service of Christ, by Christopheros\r\n(Christbearer), Gilchrist, and Malise; and the Arabic has Abd-Allah, and\r\nAbd-el-Kadir, servant of the Almighty.

The Gaelic devotion was almost all\r\nexpressed in the Giolla and Mael prefix.\r\n\r\nIdol names are of course numerous, but comparison between them is not\r\neasy, as they vary with different mythologies. One point is remarkable,\r\nthat the Supreme God, whether Zeus, Jupiter, Divas, or Woden, never has\r\nso many votaries as his vassal gods. Zeno, Jovius, and, perhaps, the\r\nGrim of the North, are almost exceptions. The Phœnician Baal had,\r\nindeed, many namesakes, and the Persian Ormuzd, giver of life, had\r\nseveral, of whom the pope, called Hormisdas, was one. In general, Ares,\r\nMars, Thor, and Ranovit, the warlike gods, or the friendly Demeter and\r\nGerda, the beneficent Athene, the brilliant Artemis, and Irish Brighde,\r\nthe queens of heaven, Hera, Juno, Frigga, are chosen for namesakes.\r\nMithras in Persia, and Apollo in Greece, have their share; but, in\r\ngeneral, the sun is not very popular, though Aurora and Zora honour the\r\ndawn; and the North has various Dags.\r\n\r\nOf animals the choice is much smaller than would have been expected. The\r\nlion’s home is, of course, the East, and _Sinha_, his Sanscrit title, is\r\nrepresented by the Singh, so familiar in the names of Hindu chiefs. The\r\nArabs have Arslan in many combinations; the Greeks introduced Leo, which\r\nhas been followed by the Romans, and come into the rest of Europe; but\r\nmany as were the lion names of Greece and later Rome, Leonard, and,\r\nperhaps, Lionel, alone are of European growth.\r\n\r\nThe elephant is utterly unrepresented, unless we accept the tradition,\r\nthat the cognomen of Cæsar arose from his African name. Persia has a few\r\nleopards, such as Chitratachna.\r\n\r\nThe bear does not show himself in favourable colours in the South, and\r\nUrsus and Ursula are more likely to be translations of the northern\r\nBiorn—so extremely common—than original Latin names. The Erse, however,\r\nowns him as Mahon.\r\n\r\nThe wolf is the really popular animal. Even the Hebrews knew Zeeb\r\nthrough the Midianites, the Greeks used Lycos in all sorts of forms, the\r\nRomans had many a Lupus, the Teutons have Wolf in every possible\r\ncombination, the Slaves Vuk; the Kelts alone avoid the great enemy of\r\nthe fold, whose frequency is almost inexplicable. The Kelts are,\r\nhowever, the namesakes of the dog, the Cu and Con, so much loathed in\r\nother lands, that only a stray Danish Hund, Italian Cane, and the one\r\nHebrew Caleb, unite in bearing his name in honour of his faithful\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThe horse is, of course, neglected in Judea, where his use was\r\nforbidden; but in Sanscrit was found Vradaçva, owning great horses; and\r\nthe horse flourished all over Persia. Aspamithras, horse’s friend,\r\nAspachava, rich in horses, Vishtaspa, and many more, commemorate the\r\nanimal; and in Greece, Hippolytus, Hippodamos, Hippomedon, Hipparchus,\r\nand many more, showed that riding was the glory of the Hellenes. Rome\r\nhas no representative of her _equus_, except in Equitius, a doubtful\r\nname, more likely to be named in honour of the equestrian order, than\r\ndirect from the animal. Marcus may, however, be from the word that\r\nformed the Keltic March, which, with Eachan and Eochaid, and many more,\r\nrepresent the love of horses among the Kelts, answering to the\r\nEporedorix, mentioned by Cæsar. The Slaves have apparently no horse\r\nnames; but many of our modern Roses are properly horses, and Jostein,\r\nRosmund, and various other forms, keep up the horse’s fame in northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nRome dealt, to a curious degree, in the most homely domestic names; Mus,\r\nthe surname of the devoted Decius, was, probably, really a mouse; for\r\nwhile the swine of other nations never descend below the savage wild\r\nboar of the forest—Eber, Baezan, Bravac, the Romans have indeed one\r\nAper, but their others are but domestic pigs, Verres, Porcius, Scrofa.\r\n\r\nGoats flourished in Greece in honour of the Ægis, and of Zeus goats, and\r\nÆgidios, with others, there arose; but Sichelgaita, and a few northern\r\nGeits, alone reflect them. The chamois, or mountain goat, named Tabitha\r\nor Dorcas, and is paralleled by an occasional masculine Hirsch, or stag,\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nThe sheep appears to be solely represented by Rachael, for though the\r\nlamb has laid claim to both Agnes and Lambert, it is only through a\r\ndelusion of sound.\r\n\r\nSerpents, as Orm and Lind, are peculiar to the North.\r\n\r\nThe eagle figures in Aias, Ajax, Aquila, the Russian Orlof, and many an\r\nArn of the Teutons. It is rather surprising not to find him among the\r\nGael; but the raven, like the wolf, is the fashionable creature, as an\r\nattendant upon slaughter—Oreb, Corvus, Morvren, Fiachra, Rafn, he croaks\r\nhis name over the plunderer everywhere but among the Greeks and Slaves.\r\n\r\nThe swan has Gelges in Ireland, Svanwhit in the North; the dove named\r\nJonah, Jemima in Palestine, Columba in Christian Latinity, Golubica in\r\nIllyria; but gentle birds are, in general, entirely neglected, unless\r\nthe Greek Philomela, which properly means loving honey, were named after\r\nthe nightingale. The Latin Gallus may possibly be a cock; but Genserich\r\nis not the gander king, as he was so long supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThe bee had Deborah in Hebrew, and Melissa in Greek; but, in general,\r\ninsects are not popular, though Vespasian is said to come from a wasp;\r\nand among fishes, the dolphin has the only namesakes in Romance tongues,\r\nprobably blunders from Delphi.\r\n\r\nPlants were now and then commemorated; Tamar, a palm tree, Hadassah, a\r\nmyrtle, are among the scanty eastern examples. Rome had a Robur, and\r\nIllyria Dobruslav, in honour of the oak; but the Slaves have almost the\r\nonly genuine flower names. Rhoda is, indeed, a true Greek Rose, but the\r\nmodern ones are mistakes for _hross_, a horse. Violet, probably, rose\r\nout of Valens, and Lilias from Cæcilius, Oliver from Olaf. Primrose,\r\nIvy, Eglantine, &c., have been invented in modern books at least, and so\r\nhas Amaranth.\r\n\r\nPassing to qualities, goodness is found in many an Agathos of the\r\nGreeks, with his superlative Aristos, but early Rome chiefly dealt in\r\nValens, leaving Bonus and Melior for her later inventors to use. The\r\n_goods_ of the Teutons are rather doubtful between the names of the\r\nDeity and of war, but in passing them, the relation between Gustaf and\r\nScipio should be observed. The Slaves have many compounds of both Dobry\r\nand Blago, and the Irish, Alma.\r\n\r\nLove is everywhere. David represents it in Hebrew, Agape and Phile in\r\nGreek; but the grim Roman never used the compounds of his _amo_, only\r\nleft them to form many a gentle modern name—Amabel, Aimée, Amy. Caradoc\r\nwas the old Cymric, and Aiffe the Gadhaelic, beloved; and Wine and Leof\r\nin the German races, Ljubov, Libusa, Milica in the Slavonic, proved the\r\nwarm hearts of the people. Indeed, the Slavonic names are the tenderest\r\nof all, owning Bratoljub and Çedomil, fraternal and parental love,\r\nunparalleled except by the satirical surnames of the Alexandrian kings.\r\n\r\nPurity—a Christian idea—is found in Agnes and Katherine, both Greek;\r\nperhaps, too, Devoslava, or maiden glory, with the Slaves. Holiness is\r\nin the Hieronymus and Hagios of heathen Greece, meaning a holy name, and\r\nin the northern Ercen and Vieh, at the beginning and end of names, the\r\nSviato of the Slavonians.\r\n\r\nPeace, always lovely and longed-for, names both Absalom and Solomon, and\r\nafter them many an eastern Selim and Selima. Greece had Irene and\r\nIrenæus, but not till Christian days, and the Roman Pacificus was a very\r\nmodern invention; but the Friedrich, &c., of the North, and Miroslav of\r\nthe Slav, were much more ancient.\r\n\r\nThe soul is to be found in Greece, as Psyche, and nowhere else but in\r\nthe Welsh Enid. Life, however, figured at Rome, as Vitalis, and in the\r\nTeutonic nations as the prefix _fjor_; and the Greek Zoë kept it up in\r\nhonour of the oldest of all female names, Eve.\r\n\r\nGrace is the Hebrew Hannah or Anna, and the _charis_ in Greek compounds.\r\nEucharis would not answer amiss to the Adelheid, or noble cheer, of\r\nTeuton damsels. Abigail, or father’s joy, Zenobia, father’s ornament,\r\nare in the same spirit.\r\n\r\n_Eu_, meaning both happy and rich, wealthy in its best sense, is exactly\r\nfollowed by the Northern _ad_ and Anglo-Saxon _ead_. Eulalia and\r\nEulogios are the same as Edred, Euphrasia would answer to Odny, Eucharis\r\nand Aine likewise have the same sense of gladness. Eugenois is, perhaps,\r\nrather in the sense of Olaf, or of the host of Adels and Ethels.\r\nPatrocles and Cleopatra, both meaning the father’s fame, have nothing\r\nexactly analogous to them in the Teuton and Keltic world.\r\n\r\nRoyalty is found in the Syriac Malchus, the Persian Kshahtra, or Xerxes,\r\nthe Malek of the Arab, the early Archos, Basileus, and Tyrannos of the\r\nlate Greek; even the Roman Regulus, with Tigearnach among the Kelts, and\r\nRik in its compounds in the Teutonic world. The loftiness and strength\r\nof the royal power is expressed in the Persian prefix _arta_, first\r\ncousin to our Keltic Art and Arthur, akin to the root that forms Ares,\r\nArius, Arteinus, and many more familiar names from the superlative\r\nAristos. It is the idea of strength and manhood, perhaps akin to the\r\nLatin _vir_ and Keltic _fear_. Boleslav is the Wendic name, filling up\r\nthe cycle of strength and manly virtue.\r\n\r\nMajesty and greatness are commemorated by closely resembling words—the\r\nPersian Mathista or Masistes, Megas and Megalos in their Greek\r\ncompounds, Latin Magnus and Maximus, Keltic Mor, Teutonic Mer; it is\r\nonly the Velika of the Slav that does not follow the same root. The\r\ncrown names Stephanas and Venceslas, or crown glory.\r\n\r\nJustice and judgment are the prevalent ideas in the Hebrew Dan and\r\nShaphat, Greek Archos, Dike, and Krite, Latin Justinus, Northern Ragn;\r\nperhaps, too, in the Irish Phelim and Slavonic Upravda. _Damo_, to tame,\r\nis in many Greek names; and _ward_, or protection, answers to the Latin\r\nTitus.\r\n\r\nVenerable is the Persian Arsaces, with Augustus and Sebastian. Power\r\nfigures in Vladimir and Waldemar, and the many forms of _wald_; and, on\r\nthe other hand, the people assert themselves in the Laos and Demos of\r\nGreece, the _leutfolk_ and _theod_ of the Teuton, and even the _ljud_ of\r\nthe Slave. The lover of his people may be found under the various titles\r\nof Demophilos, Publicola, Theodwine, and the Slavonic feminine Ludmila;\r\ntheir ruler, as Democritus, or Archilaus, or Theodoric; their tamer, as\r\nLaodamos; their justice, as Laodike.\r\n\r\nBoulos, council, finds a parallel in the Teuton _raad_; but Sophia,\r\nwisdom, is far too cultivated for an analogy among the name-makers of\r\nthe rude North.\r\n\r\nBut fame and glory were more popular than wisdom and justice. _Slava_\r\nrings through the names of the Wends, and _klas_ through the Greeks;\r\nwhile _hluod_ and _hruod_ form half the leading names of Germanized\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nClara is the late Latin name best implying fame, but answering best to\r\nBertha, bright, like the Phlegon of Greece, and Barsines of Persia,\r\nwhich are all from one root. Lucius, light, translates some of these.\r\n\r\nConquest, that most desired of events to a warlike nation, is the Nike\r\nof the Greeks. Nikias, Victor, Sige, Cobhflaith, are all identical in\r\nmeaning; and the Greek and Teuton have again and again curiously similar\r\ncompounds. Nicephorous and Sigebot, Nikoboulous and Sigfred, Stratonice\r\nwould perhaps be paralleled by Sighilda. Nicolas has not an exact\r\nlikeness, because the Teutons never place either _sige_ or _theod_ at\r\nthe end of a word.\r\n\r\nWar itself has absorbed the Teuton _spear_, and is _ger_ in our Teuton\r\nlands. But the Greek _mache_, and Teuton _hadu_, the Kelt _cath_, and\r\nthe Slav _boj_ or _voj_, all are in common use. Telemachus, or distant\r\nbattle, is best represented by Siroslav, or distant glory. Stratos,\r\nmeaning both army and camp, Kleostralos and Stratokles, answer to\r\nStanislav; and Cadwaladyr, in sound as well as sense, to Haduvald.\r\n\r\nCathair, the Irish battle-slaughter, has likeness in the Teutonic\r\nderivatives of Val, but the North stands alone in honouring the Thiof\r\nwith namesakes.\r\n\r\nThe hero, the warrior himself, the _Hero_ as he really is of Greece, the\r\n_Landnama-bok_ of our Teutons, the _Landnama-bok_ and _Landnama-bok_ and\r\n_Landnama-bok_ of Ireland, the _Landnama-bok_ of the Roman, has\r\nnamesakes in hosts. Herakles himself was not far removed from Herbert,\r\nRobert, or Lothaire, in meaning; and Sigeher is the conquering warrior,\r\nas Nikostratos is the victorious army.\r\n\r\nIn fact, warlike names are exhausting in similarity and multitude, and\r\nour readers will discover many more for themselves. The peaceful ones\r\nare far more characteristic.\r\n\r\nSee how the ocean figures in Pelagios, in Morvan, Muircheartash,\r\nHaflide,—all the formation of maritime nations, while the Slaves have no\r\nsea names at all, and the Latin Marina is mere late coinage. It is the\r\nWelsh, however, who have the most sea names: Guenever, Bronwen, Dwynwen,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe earth makes Georgos and Agricola, and its cultivators have in Greece\r\ncommemorated their harvest with Eustaches and Theresa; in Illyria, their\r\nvintage with Grozdana; but though the old farmer citizens of Rome were\r\ncalled Faber, Lentulus, Cicero, and the like, produce of their fields,\r\nthese were much too homely for our fierce Teuton ancestry.\r\n\r\nGold is not in much favour; Chryseis, Aurelia, Orflath, and Zlata, just\r\nrepresent it; and silver is to be found in Argyro, Argentine, and\r\nArianwen; but iron nowhere but with the Germanic races, Eisambart, &c.,\r\nin accordance with the weapon names in which they alone delight. Nor are\r\njewels many,—Esmeralda, Jasper (perhaps), Margaret, Ligach, are almost\r\ntheir only representatives. Spices we have as Kezia, Muriel, and\r\nstrangest of all, Kerenhappuch, a box of stibium for the eyes. Whether\r\nthe Stein of the North is to be regarded as a jewel does not seem clear,\r\nbut it is more according to the temper of the owners to regard it as\r\nanswering to Petros, a rock. Veig, Laug, and Øl, represent liquors, and\r\nare one of the peculiarities of the North.\r\n\r\nBeauty is less common than might have been expected. Kallista is the\r\nleading owner of the word in Greece, but the Latin _bella_ must not be\r\nclaimed for it, and, in spite of the _ny_ and _fridhr_ of the North, it\r\nis the Kelts who deal most in names of beauty,—Findelbh, Graine, and\r\nmore than can here be specified.\r\n\r\nIndeed, complexion names are chiefly found among the Kelts and Romans.\r\nThe white, Albanus and Finn, (which last Finn passed to the North,) with\r\nGwenn in Wales and Brittany; the light-haired, Flavius, Rufus, Ruadh,\r\nand Dearg. Fulvius, Niger, and Dubh, with the answering Swerker,\r\nparalleled only by the late Greek Melania have very few answering names\r\nin other lands, though the Bruno of Germany corresponds to Don, and the\r\nBlond, now Blount, of England is said to be meant to translate Fulvius.\r\n\r\nOn exceptional names, from the circumstances of the birth, we have not\r\nhere dwelt. They were accidental, and never became national, except from\r\nthe fame of some bearer of one. The names derived from places are almost\r\nall Latin, at first cognomina, then taken at baptism by converts. The\r\nnumber names are likewise Latin. Those of high Christian ideas, like\r\nAnastasius, Ambrosius, Alethea, are generally Greek; and when Latins as\r\nBenedictus, the blessed, and Beatrix, the blesser, are apt to be\r\nrenderings of the Greek. The early Latin names are the least explicable,\r\nand the least resembling those of other nations; the Keltic are the most\r\npoetical; the Slavonic either tender or warlike; the Greek and the\r\nTeutonic are the most analogous to one another in sense, and are the\r\nmost in use, except the more endeared and wide-spread of the\r\nHebrew,—John and Mary deservedly have the pre-eminence in the Christian\r\nworld above all others.\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n       ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n         LONDON: R.

Missing page references may or may not indicate\r\n   that they do or do not appear in the text.\r\n ● Some entries include a question mark, indicating some uncertainty in\r\n   the author or editor’s mind.\r\n\r\nEach entry is given as printed, save where there are obvious\r\ndiscrepancies between the Glossary and the referenced text. These are\r\nresolved based on the context, as noted below.\r\n\r\n                                 Notes\r\n\r\n xxv.45     As an example, ‘Anuerin’, which has no page reference, is\r\n              mentioned multiple times as a Welsh bard, and the name\r\n              appears once in a list of Welsh names, but is not\r\n              otherwise remarked upon.\r\n\r\n xliii.5    The entry for ‘Coralie’ ends with a comma, without a page\r\n              reference. The name appears on p. 456.\r\n\r\n xlv.27     In the Glossary, ‘Darius’ includes a page number (followed\r\n              by a question mark) which refers to a section on Persian\r\n              names, where only ‘Cyrus’ is discussed.\r\n\r\n lxii.6     There are two entries for ‘Gandolf’, once as a ‘primary\r\n              form’ (capitalized) and once in ‘Roman type’ as a form\r\n              ‘since assumed’.\r\n\r\n lxxxiii.31 The Lusatian name ‘Jjewa’ is not on p. 11 of the text, which\r\n              mentions only ‘Hejba or Hejbka’.\r\n\r\n xciii.15   _Loiseach_ appears only on p. 133, and not on p. 405, as\r\n              printed. The page reference was corrected.\r\n\r\n cxviii.23  An out-of-order entry for ‘Marl’ is duplicated in the proper\r\n              order.\r\n\r\n 78.50      The reference to ‘his’ father seems incorrect, since his\r\n              wife would be grateful to Phillip II of Spain (husband of\r\n              Queen Mary, and hence ‘King Consort’)for interceding in\r\n              the life of _her_ father.\r\n\r\n 100.19     The epsilon in Θεκλα (Thekla) on p. 100 was printed with an\r\n              invalid circumflex (~).\r\n\r\n 290.26     The Anglo-Saxon O character in ‘Ocscetyl’ is printed,\r\n              seemingly intentionally, with an interior triangular mark\r\n              [Odd Anglo-Saxon O].\r\n\r\n 305.43     The author gives a rune as ‘thorn’ resembling a  capital\r\n              Greek lambda (Λ). The thorn rune is actually [thorn].\r\n\r\nOther errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected,\r\nand are noted here. The references are to the page and line, or\r\nindicates that the issue appears in a footnote in the original.\r\n\r\n                              Corrections\r\n\r\n vi.32      far greater difficulties[.] for                Removed.\r\n xxi.1      Teu[,/.] elf ruler,                            Replaced.\r\n xxiii.4    _Sl[o/a]v._ Gr. helper                         Replaced.\r\n xxiii.52   Fr. with w[h]iskers                            Inserted.\r\n xxiv.5     Ama[ oe/deo],                                  Corrupted.\r\n xxv.35     Andreze[k/j]                                   Replaced\r\n                                                           (probable).\r\n xxxi.14    BALDETRUD, _[m/f]._                            Replaced.\r\n xxxiv.19   Bérang[erè/ère]                                Replaced.\r\n lx.32      _Fra[ncy/cyn]tje_                              Transposed.\r\n lx.44      _Fran[z/s]je_                                  Replaced.\r\n lxxiii.2   _Netherland[s]_                                Added.\r\n lxxiv.15   H[e/é]lène                                     Replaced.\r\n lxxix.22   I[ñ]igo                                        Restored.\r\n lxxxiii.9  Jo[a]qui[n/m]a                                 From p. 37.\r\n xci.47     Le[a/o]nhardine                                Replaced.\r\n cxiii.12   RADEG[U/O]NDA                                  Replaced.\r\n cxxvi.18   SWANH[WITE/VIT]                                Replaced.\r\n cxxxii.7   _Tone[e]k_                                     Removed.\r\n cxlii      remembrance of the [Lord]                      Restored.\r\n cxliii.8   ZLATI[D/B]OR                                   Replaced.\r\n cxliii.11  ZLATOLJU[D/B]                                  Replaced.\r\n 13.12      Atalik, [(]fatherlike or paternal,)            Removed.\r\n 14.42      Rebekah’s two daughters-in-law[s]              Removed.\r\n 27.23      is used els[e]where                            Inserted.\r\n 29.34      are men[it/ti]oned in the pedigree             Transposed.\r\n 30.35      N[eu/ue]stra Señora del Pilar                  Transposed.\r\n 30.41      a vision of N[eu/ue]stra Señora                Transposed.\r\n 36.note    _Deutsch[a/e] Mythologie_                      Replaced.\r\n 43.9       pa[rt/tr]iarch St. Joannes the Silent          Transposed.\r\n 60.23      a maiden[)]                                    Added.\r\n 65.17      still more magnific[i]ent                      Removed.\r\n 65.40      the deacon[n]ess                               Removed.\r\n 67.46      the hateful A[c]quitanian grandmother          Removed.\r\n 72.19      and ὄρνυμ[υ/ι] (to raise)                      Replaced.\r\n 86.14      Andreje[e]k                                    Removed\r\n                                                           (probable).\r\n 88.14      [Feminine]                                     Presumed.\r\n 88.44      Ε[ὔ/ὐ]στᾶθηος (steadfast)                      Diacritic\r\n                                                           removed.\r\n 93.41      Attalus Phila[l]dephus                         Inserted.\r\n 95.14      feminine Λα[ό/ο]δ[α/ά]μεία                     Misplaced\r\n                                                           diacritics.\r\n 95.31      Κλ[έ/ε]οπ[α/ά]τρα                              Misplaced\r\n                                                           diacritics.\r\n 138.36     merged this unwield[l]y title                  Removed.\r\n 167.48     that[.] after having served                    Removed.\r\n 187.note   Michaelis[,/.]                                 Replaced.\r\n 191.40     and to France, a[t/s] St. Hilaire.
