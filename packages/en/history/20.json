Him the Almighty Power\r\nHurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie\r\nWith hideous ruine and combustion down\r\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell\r\nIn Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,\r\nWho durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.\r\nNine times the Space that measures Day and Night\r\nTo mortal men, he with his horrid crew\r\nLay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe\r\nConfounded though immortal: But his doom\r\nReserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought\r\nBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain\r\nTorments him; round he throws his baleful eyes\r\nThat witness’d huge affliction and dismay\r\nMixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:\r\nAt once as far as Angels kenn he views\r\nThe dismal Situation waste and wilde,\r\nA Dungeon horrible, on all sides round\r\nAs one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames\r\nNo light, but rather darkness visible\r\nServ’d only to discover sights of woe,\r\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\r\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes\r\nThat comes to all; but torture without end\r\nStill urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed\r\nWith ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:\r\nSuch place Eternal Justice had prepar’d\r\nFor those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d\r\nIn utter darkness, and their portion set\r\nAs far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n\r\nAs from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.\r\nO how unlike the place from whence they fell!\r\nThere the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d\r\nWith Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,\r\nHe soon discerns, and weltring by his side\r\nOne next himself in power, and next in crime,\r\nLong after known in _Palestine_, and nam’d\r\n_Beelzebub_.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,\r\nAnd thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words\r\nBreaking the horrid silence thus began.\r\n\r\nIf thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d\r\nFrom him, who in the happy Realms of Light\r\nCloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine\r\nMyriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,\r\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope,\r\nAnd hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,\r\nJoynd with me once, now misery hath joynd\r\nIn equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest\r\nFrom what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd\r\nHe with his Thunder: and till then who knew\r\nThe force of those dire Arms? yet not for those\r\nNor what the Potent Victor in his rage\r\nCan else inflict do I repent or change,\r\nThough chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind\r\nAnd high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,\r\nThat with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,\r\nAnd to the fierce contention brought along\r\nInnumerable force of Spirits arm’d\r\nThat durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,\r\nHis utmost power with adverse power oppos’d\r\nIn dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,\r\nAnd shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?\r\nAll is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\r\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\r\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\r\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\r\nThat Glory never shall his wrath or might\r\nExtort from me.  To bow and sue for grace\r\nWith suppliant knee, and deifie his power\r\nWho from the terrour of this Arm so late\r\nDoubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\r\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath\r\nThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\r\nAnd this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\r\nSince through experience of this great event\r\nIn Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,\r\nWe may with more successful hope resolve\r\nTo wage by force or guile eternal Warr\r\nIrreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\r\nWho now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy\r\nSole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.\r\n\r\nSo spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,\r\nVaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:\r\nAnd him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.\r\n\r\nO Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\r\nThat led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\r\nUnder thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\r\nFearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;\r\nAnd put to proof his high Supremacy,\r\nWhether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\r\nToo well I see and rue the dire event,\r\nThat with sad overthrow and foul defeat\r\nHath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host\r\nIn horrible destruction laid thus low,\r\nAs far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences\r\nCan Perish: for the mind and spirit remains\r\nInvincible, and vigour soon returns,\r\nThough all our Glory extinct, and happy state\r\nHere swallow’d up in endless misery.\r\nBut what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\r\nOf force believe Almighty, since no less\r\nThen such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)\r\nHave left us this our spirit and strength intire\r\nStrongly to suffer and support our pains,\r\nThat we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\r\nOr do him mightier service as his thralls\r\nBy right of Warr, what e’re his business be\r\nHere in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\r\nOr do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\r\nWhat can it then avail though yet we feel\r\nStrength undiminisht, or eternal being\r\nTo undergo eternal punishment?\r\nWhereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.\r\n\r\nFall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable\r\nDoing or Suffering: but of this be sure,\r\nTo do ought good never will be our task,\r\nBut ever to do ill our sole delight,\r\nAs being the contrary to his high will\r\nWhom we resist.  If then his Providence\r\nOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,\r\nOur labour must be to pervert that end,\r\nAnd out of good still to find means of evil;\r\nWhich oft times may succeed, so as perhaps\r\nShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb\r\nHis inmost counsels from their destind aim.\r\nBut see the angry Victor hath recall’d\r\nHis Ministers of vengeance and pursuit\r\nBack to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail\r\nShot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid\r\nThe fiery Surge, that from the Precipice\r\nOf Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,\r\nWing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,\r\nPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now\r\nTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\r\nLet us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,\r\nOr satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\r\nSeest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,\r\nThe seat of desolation, voyd of light,\r\nSave what the glimmering of these livid flames\r\nCasts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend\r\nFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,\r\nThere rest, if any rest can harbour there,\r\nAnd reassembling our afflicted Powers,\r\nConsult how we may henceforth most offend\r\nOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,\r\nHow overcome this dire Calamity,\r\nWhat reinforcement we may gain from Hope,\r\nIf not what resolution from despare.\r\n\r\nThus Satan talking to his neerest Mate\r\nWith Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\r\nThat sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides\r\nProne on the Flood, extended long and large\r\nLay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\r\nAs whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\r\n_Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warr’d on _Jove_,\r\n_Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den\r\nBy ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast\r\n_Leviathan_, which God of all his works\r\nCreated hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:\r\nHim haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam\r\nThe Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,\r\nDeeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,\r\nWith fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\r\nMoors by his side under the Lee, while Night\r\nInvests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\r\nSo stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\r\nChain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence\r\nHad ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will\r\nAnd high permission of all-ruling Heaven\r\nLeft him at large to his own dark designs,\r\nThat with reiterated crimes he might\r\nHeap on himself damnation, while he sought\r\nEvil to others, and enrag’d might see\r\nHow all his malice serv’d but to bring forth\r\nInfinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\r\nOn Man by him seduc’t, but on himself\r\nTreble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.\r\nForthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\r\nHis mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\r\nDrivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld\r\nIn billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.\r\nThen with expanded wings he stears his flight\r\nAloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\r\nThat felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\r\nHe lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d\r\nWith solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\r\nAnd such appear’d in hue, as when the force\r\nOf subterranean wind transports a Hill\r\nTorn from _Pelorus_, or the shatter’d side\r\nOf thundring _Aetna_, whose combustible\r\nAnd fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,\r\nSublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,\r\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involv’d\r\nWith stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\r\nOf unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,\r\nBoth glorying to have scap’t the _Stygian_ flood\r\nAs Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,\r\nNot by the sufferance of supernal Power.\r\n\r\nIs this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,\r\nSaid then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat\r\nThat we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom\r\nFor that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee\r\nWho now is Sovran can dispose and bid\r\nWhat shall be right: fardest from him is best\r\nWhom reason hath equald, force hath made supream\r\nAbove his equals.  Farewel happy Fields\r\nWhere Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail\r\nInfernal world, and thou profoundest Hell\r\nReceive thy new Possessor: One who brings\r\nA mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.\r\nThe mind is its own place, and in it self\r\nCan make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.\r\nWhat matter where, if I be still the same,\r\nAnd what I should be, all but less then hee\r\nWhom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least\r\nWe shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built\r\nHere for his envy, will not drive us hence:\r\nHere we may reign secure, and in my choyce\r\nTo reign is worth ambition though in Hell:\r\nBetter to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.\r\nBut wherefore let we then our faithful friends,\r\nTh’ associates and copartners of our loss\r\nLye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,\r\nAnd call them not to share with us their part\r\nIn this unhappy Mansion, or once more\r\nWith rallied Arms to try what may be yet\r\nRegaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?\r\n\r\nSo _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_\r\nThus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,\r\nWhich but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,\r\nIf once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge\r\nOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft\r\nIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edge\r\nOf battel when it rag’d, in all assaults\r\nTheir surest signal, they will soon resume\r\nNew courage and revive, though now they lye\r\nGroveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,\r\nAs we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,\r\nNo wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.\r\n\r\nHe scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend\r\nWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield\r\nEthereal temper, massy, large and round,\r\nBehind him cast; the broad circumference\r\nHung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb\r\nThrough Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views\r\nAt Ev’ning from the top of _Fesole_,\r\nOr in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands,\r\nRivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.\r\nHis Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine\r\nHewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast\r\nOf some great Ammiral, were but a wand,\r\nHe walkt with to support uneasie steps\r\nOver the burning Marle, not like those steps\r\nOn Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime\r\nSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;\r\nNathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach\r\nOf that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d\r\nHis Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t\r\nThick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks\r\nIn _Vallombrosa_, where th’ _Etrurian_ shades\r\nHigh overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge\r\nAfloat, when with fierce Winds _Orion_ arm’d\r\nHath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew\r\n_Busiris_ and his _Memphian_ Chivalrie,\r\nVVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d\r\nThe Sojourners of _Goshen_, who beheld\r\nFrom the safe shore their floating Carkases\r\nAnd broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown\r\nAbject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,\r\nUnder amazement of their hideous change.\r\nHe call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep\r\nOf Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,\r\nWarriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,\r\nIf such astonishment as this can sieze\r\nEternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place\r\nAfter the toyl of Battel to repose\r\nYour wearied vertue, for the ease you find\r\nTo slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?\r\nOr in this abject posture have ye sworn\r\nTo adore the Conquerour? who now beholds\r\nCherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood\r\nWith scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon\r\nHis swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern\r\nTh’ advantage, and descending tread us down\r\nThus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts\r\nTransfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.\r\nAwake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.\r\n\r\nThey heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\r\nUpon the wing, as when men wont to watch\r\nOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\r\nRouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\r\nNor did they not perceave the evil plight\r\nIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\r\nYet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\r\nInnumerable.  As when the potent Rod\r\nOf _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day\r\nWav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud\r\nOf _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind,\r\nThat ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung\r\nLike Night, and darken’d all the Land of _Nile_:\r\nSo numberless were those bad Angels seen\r\nHovering on wing under the Cope of Hell\r\n’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\r\nTill, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear\r\nOf their great Sultan waving to direct\r\nThir course, in even ballance down they light\r\nOn the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;\r\nA multitude, like which the populous North\r\nPour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass\r\n_Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons\r\nCame like a Deluge on the South, and spread\r\nBeneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands.\r\nForthwith from every Squadron and each Band\r\nThe Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\r\nTheir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms\r\nExcelling human, Princely Dignities,\r\nAnd Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;\r\nThough of their Names in heav’nly Records now\r\nBe no memorial, blotted out and ras’d\r\nBy thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\r\nNor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_\r\nGot them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,\r\nThrough Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\r\nBy falsities and lyes the greatest part\r\nOf Mankind they corrupted to forsake\r\nGod their Creator, and th’ invisible\r\nGlory of him, that made them, to transform\r\nOft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d\r\nWith gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\r\nAnd Devils to adore for Deities:\r\nThen were they known to men by various Names,\r\nAnd various Idols through the Heathen World.\r\nSay, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,\r\nRous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\r\nAt thir great Emperors call, as next in worth\r\nCame singly where he stood on the bare strand,\r\nWhile the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?\r\nThe chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\r\nRoaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix\r\nTheir Seats long after next the Seat of God,\r\nTheir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d\r\nAmong the Nations round, and durst abide\r\n_Jehovah_ thundring out of _Sion_, thron’d\r\nBetween the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d\r\nWithin his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,\r\nAbominations; and with cursed things\r\nHis holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,\r\nAnd with their darkness durst affront his light.\r\nFirst _Moloch_, horrid King besmear’d with blood\r\nOf human sacrifice, and parents tears,\r\nThough for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\r\nTheir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\r\nTo his grim Idol.  Him the _Ammonite_\r\nWorshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain,\r\nIn _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream\r\nOf utmost _Arnon_.  Nor content with such\r\nAudacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\r\nOf _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build\r\nHis Temple right against the Temple of God\r\nOn that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\r\nThe pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence\r\nAnd black _Gehenna_ call’d, the Type of Hell.\r\nNext _Chemos_, th’ obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons,\r\nFrom _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild\r\nOf Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_\r\nAnd _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond\r\nThe flowry Dale of _Sibma_ clad with Vines,\r\nAnd _Eleale_ to th’ _Asphaltick_ Pool.\r\n_Peor_ his other Name, when he entic’d\r\n_Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_\r\nTo do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\r\nYet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d\r\nEven to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove\r\nOf _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate;\r\nTill good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell.\r\nWith these came they, who from the bordring flood\r\nOf old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts\r\n_Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names\r\nOf _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male,\r\nThese Feminine.  For Spirits when they please\r\nCan either Sex assume, or both; so soft\r\nAnd uncompounded is their Essence pure,\r\nNot ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,\r\nNor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\r\nLike cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\r\nDilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,\r\nCan execute their aerie purposes,\r\nAnd works of love or enmity fulfill.\r\nFor those the Race of _Israel_ oft forsook\r\nTheir living strength, and unfrequented left\r\nHis righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\r\nTo bestial Gods; for which their heads as low\r\nBow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\r\nOf despicable foes.  With these in troop\r\nCame _Astoreth_, whom the _Phoenicians_ call’d\r\n_Astarte_, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;\r\nTo whose bright Image nightly by the Moon\r\n_Sidonian_ Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,\r\nIn _Sion_ also not unsung, where stood\r\nHer Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built\r\nBy that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\r\nBeguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell\r\nTo Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind,\r\nWhose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allur’d\r\nThe _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate\r\nIn amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\r\nWhile smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock\r\nRan purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood\r\nOf _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale\r\nInfected _Sions_ daughters with like heat,\r\nWhose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\r\n_Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led\r\nHis eye survay’d the dark Idolatries\r\nOf alienated _Judah_.  Next came one\r\nWho mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark\r\nMaim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off\r\nIn his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,\r\nWhere he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:\r\n_Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\r\nAnd downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\r\nRear’d in _Azotus_, dreaded through the Coast\r\nOf _Palestine_, in _Gath_ and _Ascalon_,\r\nAnd _Accaron_ and _Gaza’s_ frontier bounds.\r\nHim follow’d _Rimmon_, whose delightful Seat\r\nWas fair _Damscus_, on the fertil Banks\r\nOf _Abbana_ and _Pharphar_, lucid streams.\r\nHe also against the house of God was bold:\r\nA Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,\r\n_Ahaz_ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\r\nGods Altar to disparage and displace\r\nFor one of _Syrian_ mode, whereon to burn\r\nHis odious offrings, and adore the Gods\r\nWhom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d\r\nA crew who under Names of old Renown,\r\n_Osiris_, _Isis_, _Orus_ and their Train\r\nWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d\r\nFanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek\r\nThir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms\r\nRather then human.  Nor did _Israel_ scape\r\nTh’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d\r\nThe Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King\r\nDoubl’d that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_,\r\nLik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\r\n_Jehovah_, who in one Night when he pass’d\r\nFrom _Egypt_ marching, equal’d with one stroke\r\nBoth her first born and all her bleating Gods.\r\n_Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\r\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\r\nVice for it self: To him no Temple stood\r\nOr Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee\r\nIn Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\r\nTurns Atheist, as did _Ely’s_ Sons, who fill’d\r\nWith lust and violence the house of God.\r\nIn Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\r\nAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\r\nOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\r\nAnd injury and outrage: And when Night\r\nDarkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\r\nOf _Belial_, flown with insolence and wine.\r\nWitness the Streets of _Sodom_, and that night\r\nIn _Gibeah_, when hospitable Dores\r\nYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\r\nThese were the prime in order and in might;\r\nThe rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,\r\nTh’ _Ionian_ Gods, of _Javans_ Issue held\r\nGods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth\r\nThir boasted Parents; _Titan_ Heav’ns first born\r\nWith his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d\r\nBy younger _Saturn_, he from mightier _Jove_\r\nHis own and _Rhea’s_ Son like measure found;\r\nSo _Jove_ usurping reign’d: these first in _Creet_\r\nAnd _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top\r\nOf cold _Olympus_ rul’d the middle Air\r\nThir highest Heav’n; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff,\r\nOr in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds\r\nOf _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old\r\nFled over _Adria_ to th’ _Hesperian_ Fields,\r\nAnd ore the _Celtic_ roam’d the utmost Isles.\r\nAll these and more came flocking; but with looks\r\nDown cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d\r\nObscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\r\nNot in despair, to have found themselves not lost\r\nIn loss it self; which on his count’nance cast\r\nLike doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\r\nSoon recollecting, with high words, that bore\r\nSemblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d\r\nTheir fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.\r\nThen strait commands that at the warlike sound\r\nOf Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\r\nHis mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d\r\n_Azazel_ as his right, a Cherube tall:\r\nWho forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\r\nTh’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t\r\nShon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\r\nWith Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,\r\nSeraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\r\nSonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\r\nAt which the universal Host upsent\r\nA shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\r\nFrighted the Reign of _Chaos_ and old Night.\r\nAll in a moment through the gloom were seen\r\nTen thousand Banners rise into the Air\r\nWith Orient Colours waving: with them rose\r\nA Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\r\nAppear’d, and serried Shields in thick array\r\nOf depth immeasurable: Anon they move\r\nIn perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood\r\nOf Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d\r\nTo highth of noblest temper Hero’s old\r\nArming to Battel, and in stead of rage\r\nDeliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d\r\nWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\r\nNor wanting power to mitigate and swage\r\nWith solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase\r\nAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\r\nFrom mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they\r\nBreathing united force with fixed thought\r\nMov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d\r\nThir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now\r\nAdvanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front\r\nOf dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\r\nOf Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,\r\nAwaiting what command thir mighty Chief\r\nHad to impose: He through the armed Files\r\nDarts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse\r\nThe whole Battalion views, thir order due,\r\nThir visages and stature as of Gods,\r\nThir number last he summs.  And now his heart\r\nDistends with pride, and hardning in his strength\r\nGlories: For never since created man,\r\nMet such imbodied force, as nam’d with these\r\nCould merit more then that small infantry\r\nWarr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\r\nOf _Phlegra_ with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d\r\nThat fought at _Theb’s_ and _Ilium_, on each side\r\nMixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\r\nIn Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son\r\nBegirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights;\r\nAnd all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel\r\nJousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_,\r\n_Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_,\r\nOr whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore\r\nWhen _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell\r\nBy _Fontarabbia_.  Thus far these beyond\r\nCompare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d\r\nThir dread Commander: he above the rest\r\nIn shape and gesture proudly eminent\r\nStood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\r\nAll her Original brightness, nor appear’d\r\nLess then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess\r\nOf Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n\r\nLooks through the Horizontal misty Air\r\nShorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\r\nIn dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\r\nOn half the Nations, and with fear of change\r\nPerplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon\r\nAbove them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face\r\nDeep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\r\nSat on his faded cheek, but under Browes\r\nOf dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\r\nWaiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast\r\nSigns of remorse and passion to behold\r\nThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather\r\n(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d\r\nFor ever now to have their lot in pain,\r\nMillions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t\r\nOf Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung\r\nFor his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\r\nThir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire\r\nHath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,\r\nWith singed top their stately growth though bare\r\nStands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d\r\nTo speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend\r\nFrom Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round\r\nWith all his Peers: attention held them mute.\r\nThrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,\r\nTears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last\r\nWords interwove with sighs found out their way.\r\n\r\nO Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers\r\nMatchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife\r\nWas not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,\r\nAs this place testifies, and this dire change\r\nHateful to utter: but what power of mind\r\nForeseeing or presaging, from the Depth\r\nOf knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,\r\nHow such united force of Gods, how such\r\nAs stood like these, could ever know repulse?\r\nFor who can yet beleeve, though after loss,\r\nThat all these puissant Legions, whose exile\r\nHath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend\r\nSelf-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.\r\nFor me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,\r\nIf counsels different, or danger shun’d\r\nBy me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns\r\nMonarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure\r\nSat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,\r\nConsent or custome, and his Regal State\r\nPut forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,\r\nWhich tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.\r\nHenceforth his might we know, and know our own\r\nSo as not either to provoke, or dread\r\nNew warr, provok’t; our better part remains\r\nTo work in close design, by fraud or guile\r\nWhat force effected not: that he no less\r\nAt length from us may find, who overcomes\r\nBy force, hath overcome but half his foe.\r\nSpace may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife\r\nThere went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long\r\nIntended to create, and therein plant\r\nA generation, whom his choice regard\r\nShould favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:\r\nThither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps\r\nOur first eruption, thither or elsewhere:\r\nFor this Infernal Pit shall never hold\r\nCaelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse\r\nLong under darkness cover.  But these thoughts\r\nFull Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,\r\nFor who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr\r\nOpen or understood must be resolv’d.\r\n\r\nHe spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew\r\nMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\r\nOf mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze\r\nFar round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d\r\nAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s\r\nClash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,\r\nHurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.\r\n\r\nThere stood a Hill not far whose griesly top\r\nBelch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire\r\nShon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign\r\nThat in his womb was hid metallic Ore,\r\nThe work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed\r\nA numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands\r\nOf Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d\r\nForerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,\r\nOr cast a Rampart.  _Mammon_ led them on,\r\n_Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell\r\nFrom heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks & thoughts\r\nWere always downward bent, admiring more\r\nThe riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,\r\nThen aught divine or holy else enjoy’d\r\nIn vision beatific: by him first\r\nMen also, and by his suggestion taught,\r\nRansack’d the Center, and with impious hands\r\nRifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth\r\nFor Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew\r\nOp’nd into the Hill a spacious wound\r\nAnd dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire\r\nThat riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best\r\nDeserve the pretious bane.  And here let those\r\nWho boast in mortal things, and wondring tell\r\nOf _Babel_, and the works of _Memphian_ Kings,\r\nLearn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,\r\nAnd Strength and Art are easily outdone\r\nBy Spirits reprobate, and in an hour\r\nWhat in an age they with incessant toyle\r\nAnd hands innumerable scarce perform\r\nNigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,\r\nThat underneath had veins of liquid fire\r\nSluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude\r\nWith wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,\r\nSevering each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:\r\nA third as soon had form’d within the ground\r\nA various mould, and from the boyling cells\r\nBy strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,\r\nAs in an Organ from one blast of wind\r\nTo many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.\r\nAnon out of the earth a Fabrick huge\r\nRose like an Exhalation, with the sound\r\nOf Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,\r\nBuilt like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round\r\nWere set, and Doric pillars overlaid\r\nWith Golden Architrave; nor did there want\r\nCornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,\r\nThe Roof was fretted Gold.  Not _Babilon_,\r\nNor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence\r\nEqual’d in all thir glories, to inshrine\r\n_Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat\r\nThir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove\r\nIn wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile\r\nStood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores\r\nOp’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide\r\nWithin, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth\r\nAnd level pavement: from the arched roof\r\nPendant by suttle Magic many a row\r\nOf Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed\r\nWith Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light\r\nAs from a sky.  The hasty multitude\r\nAdmiring enter’d, and the work some praise\r\nAnd some the Architect: his hand was known\r\nIn Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,\r\nWhere Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,\r\nAnd sat as Princes, whom the supreme King\r\nExalted to such power, and gave to rule,\r\nEach in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.\r\nNor was his name unheard or unador’d\r\nIn ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land\r\nMen call’d him _Mulciber_; and how he fell\r\nFrom Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry _Jove_\r\nSheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn\r\nTo Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,\r\nA Summers day; and with the setting Sun\r\nDropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,\r\nOn _Lemnos_ th’ _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate,\r\nErring; for he with this rebellious rout\r\nFell long before; nor aught avail’d him now\r\nTo have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape\r\nBy all his Engins, but was headlong sent\r\nWith his industrious crew to build in hell.\r\nMean while the winged Haralds by command\r\nOf Sovran power, with awful Ceremony\r\nAnd Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim\r\nA solemn Councel forthwith to be held\r\nAt _Pandaemonium_, the high Capital\r\nOf Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d\r\nFrom every and Band squared Regiment\r\nBy place or choice the worthiest; they anon\r\nWith hundreds and with thousands trooping came\r\nAttended: all access was throng’d, the Gates\r\nAnd Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall\r\n(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold\r\nWont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair\r\nDefi’d the best of Panim chivalry\r\nTo mortal combat or carreer with Lance)\r\nThick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,\r\nBrusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees\r\nIn spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,\r\nPoure forth thir populous youth about the Hive\r\nIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\r\nFlie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,\r\nThe suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,\r\nNew rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer\r\nThir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd\r\nSwarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,\r\nBehold a wonder! they but now who seemd\r\nIn bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons\r\nNow less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room\r\nThrong numberless, like that Pigmean Race\r\nBeyond the _Indian_ Mount, or Faerie Elves,\r\nWhose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side\r\nOr Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,\r\nOr dreams he sees, while over head the Moon\r\nSits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth\r\nWheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance\r\nIntent, with jocond Music charm his ear;\r\nAt once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.\r\nThus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms\r\nReduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,\r\nThough without number still amidst the Hall\r\nOf that infernal Court.  But far within\r\nAnd in thir own dimensions like themselves\r\nThe great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim\r\nIn close recess and secret conclave sat\r\nA thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,\r\nFrequent and full.  After short silence then\r\nAnd summons read, the great consult began.\r\n\r\n      THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK II.\r\n\r\nHigh on a Throne of Royal State, which far\r\nOutshon the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_,\r\nOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand\r\nShowrs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl & Gold,\r\nSatan exalted sat, by merit rais’d\r\nTo that bad eminence; and from despair\r\nThus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires\r\nBeyond thus high, insatiate to pursue\r\nVain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught\r\nHis proud imaginations thus displaid.\r\n\r\nPowers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,\r\nFor since no deep within her gulf can hold\r\nImmortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,\r\nI give not Heav’n for lost.  From this descent\r\nCelestial vertues rising, will appear\r\nMore glorious and more dread then from no fall,\r\nAnd trust themselves to fear no second fate:\r\nMee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n\r\nDid first create your Leader, next, free choice,\r\nWith what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,\r\nHath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss\r\nThus farr at least recover’d, hath much more\r\nEstablisht in a safe unenvied Throne\r\nYeilded with full consent.  The happier state\r\nIn Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw\r\nEnvy from each inferior; but who here\r\nWill envy whom the highest place exposes\r\nFormost to stand against the Thunderers aime\r\nYour bulwark, and condemns to greatest share\r\nOf endless pain? where there is then no good\r\nFor which to strive, no strife can grow up there\r\nFrom Faction; for none sure will claim in hell\r\nPrecedence, none, whose portion is so small\r\nOf present pain, that with ambitious mind\r\nWill covet more.  With this advantage then\r\nTo union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,\r\nMore then can be in Heav’n, we now return\r\nTo claim our just inheritance of old,\r\nSurer to prosper then prosperity\r\nCould have assur’d us; and by what best way,\r\nWhether of open Warr or covert guile,\r\nWe now debate; who can advise, may speak.\r\n\r\nHe ceas’d, and next him _Moloc_, Scepter’d King\r\nStood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit\r\nThat fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair:\r\nHis trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d\r\nEqual in strength, and rather then be less\r\nCar’d not to be at all; with that care lost\r\nWent all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse\r\nHe reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.\r\n\r\nMy sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,\r\nMore unexpert, I boast not: them let those\r\nContrive who need, or when they need, not now.\r\nFor while they sit contriving, shall the rest,\r\nMillions that stand in Arms, and longing wait\r\nThe Signal to ascend, sit lingring here\r\nHeav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place\r\nAccept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,\r\nThe Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns\r\nBy our delay? no, let us rather choose\r\nArm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once\r\nO’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way,\r\nTurning our Tortures into horrid Arms\r\nAgainst the Torturer; when to meet the noise\r\nOf his Almighty Engin he shall hear\r\nInfernal Thunder, and for Lightning see\r\nBlack fire and horror shot with equal rage\r\nAmong his Angels; and his Throne it self\r\nMixt with _Tartarean_ Sulphur, and strange fire,\r\nHis own invented Torments.  But perhaps\r\nThe way seems difficult and steep to scale\r\nWith upright wing against a higher foe.\r\nLet such bethink them, if the sleepy drench\r\nOf that forgetful Lake benumme not still,\r\nThat in our proper motion we ascend\r\nUp to our native seat: descent and fall\r\nTo us is adverse.  Who but felt of late\r\nWhen the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear\r\nInsulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,\r\nWith what compulsion and laborious flight\r\nWe sunk thus low?  Th’ ascent is easie then;\r\nTh’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke\r\nOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may find\r\nTo our destruction: if there be in Hell\r\nFear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse\r\nThen to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d\r\nIn this abhorred deep to utter woe;\r\nWhere pain of unextinguishable fire\r\nMust exercise us without hope of end\r\nThe Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge\r\nInexorably, and the torturing houre\r\nCalls us to Penance?  More destroy’d then thus\r\nWe should be quite abolisht and expire.\r\nWhat fear we then? what doubt we to incense\r\nHis utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d,\r\nWill either quite consume us, and reduce\r\nTo nothing this essential, happier farr\r\nThen miserable to have eternal being:\r\nOr if our substance be indeed Divine,\r\nAnd cannot cease to be, we are at worst\r\nOn this side nothing; and by proof we feel\r\nOur power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,\r\nAnd with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,\r\nThough inaccessible, his fatal Throne:\r\nWhich if not Victory is yet Revenge.\r\n\r\nHe ended frowning, and his look denounc’d\r\nDesperate revenge, and Battel dangerous\r\nTo less then Gods.  On th’ other side up rose\r\n_Belial_, in act more graceful and humane;\r\nA fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd\r\nFor dignity compos’d and high exploit:\r\nBut all was false and hollow; though his Tongue\r\nDropt Manna, and could make the worse appear\r\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\r\nMaturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;\r\nTo vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds\r\nTimorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the eare,\r\nAnd with perswasive accent thus began.\r\n\r\nI should be much for open Warr, O Peers,\r\nAs not behind in hate; if what was urg’d\r\nMain reason to perswade immediate Warr,\r\nDid not disswade me most, and seem to cast\r\nOminous conjecture on the whole success:\r\nWhen he who most excels in fact of Arms,\r\nIn what he counsels and in what excels\r\nMistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\r\nAnd utter dissolution, as the scope\r\nOf all his aim, after some dire revenge.\r\nFirst, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d\r\nWith Armed watch, that render all access\r\nImpregnable; oft on the bordering Deep\r\nEncamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing\r\nScout farr and wide into the Realm of night,\r\nScorning surprize.  Or could we break our way\r\nBy force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\r\nWith blackest Insurrection, to confound\r\nHeav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie\r\nAll incorruptible would on his Throne\r\nSit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould\r\nIncapable of stain would soon expel\r\nHer mischief, and purge off the baser fire\r\nVictorious.  Thus repuls’d, our final hope\r\nIs flat despair: we must exasperate\r\nTh’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\r\nAnd that must end us, that must be our cure,\r\nTo be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\r\nThough full of pain, this intellectual being,\r\nThose thoughts that wander through Eternity,\r\nTo perish rather, swallowd up and lost\r\nIn the wide womb of uncreated night,\r\nDevoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\r\nLet this be good, whether our angry Foe\r\nCan give it, or will ever? how he can\r\nIs doubtful; that he never will is sure.\r\nWill he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\r\nBelike through impotence, or unaware,\r\nTo give his Enemies thir wish, and end\r\nThem in his anger, whom his anger saves\r\nTo punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\r\nSay they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,\r\nReserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe;\r\nWhatever doing, what can we suffer more,\r\nWhat can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\r\nThus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\r\nWhat when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook\r\nWith Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought\r\nThe Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d\r\nA refuge from those wounds: or when we lay\r\nChain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\r\nWhat if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires\r\nAwak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage\r\nAnd plunge us in the Flames? or from above\r\nShould intermitted vengeance Arme again\r\nHis red right hand to plague us? what if all\r\nHer stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament\r\nOf Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\r\nImpendent horrors, threatning hideous fall\r\nOne day upon our heads; while we perhaps\r\nDesigning or exhorting glorious Warr,\r\nCaught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d\r\nEach on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey\r\nOf racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\r\nUnder yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;\r\nThere to converse with everlasting groans,\r\nUnrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,\r\nAges of hopeless end; this would be worse.\r\nWarr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike\r\nMy voice disswades; for what can force or guile\r\nWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\r\nViews all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth\r\nAll these our motions vain, sees and derides;\r\nNot more Almighty to resist our might\r\nThen wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\r\nShall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n\r\nThus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here\r\nChains & these Torments? better these then worse\r\nBy my advice; since fate inevitable\r\nSubdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,\r\nThe Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,\r\nOur strength is equal, nor the Law unjust\r\nThat so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,\r\nIf we were wise, against so great a foe\r\nContending, and so doubtful what might fall.\r\nI laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\r\nAnd vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear\r\nWhat yet they know must follow, to endure\r\nExile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\r\nThe sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now\r\nOur doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\r\nOur Supream Foe in time may much remit\r\nHis anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d\r\nNot mind us not offending, satisfi’d\r\nWith what is punish’t; whence these raging fires\r\nWill slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames.\r\nOur purer essence then will overcome\r\nThir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,\r\nOr chang’d at length, and to the place conformd\r\nIn temper and in nature, will receive\r\nFamiliar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\r\nThis horror will grow milde, this darkness light,\r\nBesides what hope the never-ending flight\r\nOf future days may bring, what chance, what change\r\nWorth waiting, since our present lot appeers\r\nFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\r\nIf we procure not to our selves more woe.\r\n\r\nThus _Belial_ with words cloath’d in reasons garb\r\nCounsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,\r\nNot peace: and after him thus _Mammon_ spake.\r\n\r\nEither to disinthrone the King of Heav’n\r\nWe warr, if warr be best, or to regain\r\nOur own right lost: him to unthrone we then\r\nMay hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild\r\nTo fickle Chance, and _Chaos_ judge the strife:\r\nThe former vain to hope argues as vain\r\nThe latter: for what place can be for us\r\nWithin Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream\r\nWe overpower?  Suppose he should relent\r\nAnd publish Grace to all, on promise made\r\nOf new Subjection; with what eyes could we\r\nStand in his presence humble, and receive\r\nStrict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne\r\nWith warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\r\nForc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits\r\nOur envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes\r\nAmbrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,\r\nOur servile offerings.  This must be our task\r\nIn Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom\r\nEternity so spent in worship paid\r\nTo whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue\r\nBy force impossible, by leave obtain’d\r\nUnacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state\r\nOf splendid vassalage, but rather seek\r\nOur own good from our selves, and from our own\r\nLive to our selves, though in this vast recess,\r\nFree, and to none accountable, preferring\r\nHard liberty before the easie yoke\r\nOf servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear\r\nThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,\r\nUseful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\r\nWe can create, and in what place so e’re\r\nThrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\r\nThrough labour and endurance.  This deep world\r\nOf darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst\r\nThick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire\r\nChoose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d,\r\nAnd with the Majesty of darkness round\r\nCovers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar\r\nMust’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?\r\nAs he our Darkness, cannot we his Light\r\nImitate when we please?  This Desart soile\r\nWants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;\r\nNor want we skill or art, from whence to raise\r\nMagnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?\r\nOur torments also may in length of time\r\nBecome our Elements, these piercing Fires\r\nAs soft as now severe, our temper chang’d\r\nInto their temper; which must needs remove\r\nThe sensible of pain.  All things invite\r\nTo peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State\r\nOf order, how in safety best we may\r\nCompose our present evils, with regard\r\nOf what we are and where, dismissing quite\r\nAll thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.\r\n\r\nHe scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\r\nTh’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\r\nThe sound of blustring winds, which all night long\r\nHad rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\r\nSea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\r\nOr Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\r\nAfter the Tempest: Such applause was heard\r\nAs _Mammon_ ended, and his Sentence pleas’d,\r\nAdvising peace: for such another Field\r\nThey dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\r\nOf Thunder and the Sword of _Michael_\r\nWrought still within them; and no less desire\r\nTo found this nether Empire, which might rise\r\nBy pollicy, and long process of time,\r\nIn emulation opposite to Heav’n.\r\nWhich when _Beelzebub_ perceiv’d, then whom,\r\n_Satan_ except, none higher sat, with grave\r\nAspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d\r\nA Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\r\nDeliberation sat and publick care;\r\nAnd Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\r\nMajestick though in ruin: sage he stood\r\nWith _Atlantean_ shoulders fit to bear\r\nThe weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\r\nDrew audience and attention still as Night\r\nOr Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\r\n\r\nThrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n,\r\nEthereal Vertues; or these Titles now\r\nMust we renounce, and changing stile be call’d\r\nPrinces of Hell? for so the popular vote\r\nInclines, here to continue, and build up here\r\nA growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,\r\nAnd know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d\r\nThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\r\nBeyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\r\nFrom Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League\r\nBanded against his Throne, but to remaine\r\nIn strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d,\r\nUnder th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d\r\nHis captive multitude: For he, be sure,\r\nIn highth or depth, still first and last will Reign\r\nSole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part\r\nBy our revolt, but over Hell extend\r\nHis Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule\r\nUs here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n.\r\nWhat sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?\r\nWarr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss\r\nIrreparable; tearms of peace yet none\r\nVoutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n\r\nTo us enslav’d, but custody severe,\r\nAnd stripes, and arbitrary punishment\r\nInflicted? and what peace can we return,\r\nBut to our power hostility and hate,\r\nUntam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow,\r\nYet ever plotting how the Conquerour least\r\nMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce\r\nIn doing what we most in suffering feel?\r\nNor will occasion want, nor shall we need\r\nWith dangerous expedition to invade\r\nHeav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\r\nOr ambush from the Deep.  What if we find\r\nSome easier enterprize?  There is a place\r\n(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n\r\nErr not) another World, the happy seat\r\nOf som new Race call’d _Man_, about this time\r\nTo be created like to us, though less\r\nIn power and excellence, but favour’d more\r\nOf him who rules above; so was his will\r\nPronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,\r\nThat shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.\r\nThither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\r\nWhat creatures there inhabit, of what mould,\r\nOr substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,\r\nAnd where thir weakness, how attempted best,\r\nBy force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,\r\nAnd Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure\r\nIn his own strength, this place may lye expos’d\r\nThe utmost border of his Kingdom, left\r\nTo their defence who hold it: here perhaps\r\nSom advantagious act may be achiev’d\r\nBy sudden onset, either with Hell fire\r\nTo waste his whole Creation, or possess\r\nAll as our own, and drive as we were driven,\r\nThe punie habitants, or if not drive,\r\nSeduce them to our Party, that thir God\r\nMay prove thir foe, and with repenting hand\r\nAbolish his own works.  This would surpass\r\nCommon revenge, and interrupt his joy\r\nIn our Confusion, and our Joy upraise\r\nIn his disturbance; when his darling Sons\r\nHurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse\r\nThir frail Originals, and faded bliss,\r\nFaded so soon.  Advise if this be worth\r\nAttempting, or to sit in darkness here\r\nHatching vain Empires.  Thus _Beelzebub_\r\nPleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d\r\nBy _Satan_, and in part propos’d: for whence,\r\nBut from the Author of all ill could Spring\r\nSo deep a malice, to confound the race\r\nOf mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\r\nTo mingle and involve, done all to spite\r\nThe great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves\r\nHis glory to augment.  The bold design\r\nPleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy\r\nSparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent\r\nThey vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\r\n\r\nWell have ye judg’d, well ended long debate,\r\nSynod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\r\nGreat things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep\r\nWill once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\r\nNeerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\r\nOf those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\r\nAnd opportune excursion we may chance\r\nRe-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone\r\nDwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light\r\nSecure, and at the brightning Orient beam\r\nPurge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\r\nTo heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\r\nShall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send\r\nIn search of this new world, whom shall we find\r\nSufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\r\nThe dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss\r\nAnd through the palpable obscure find out\r\nHis uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\r\nUpborn with indefatigable wings\r\nOver the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\r\nThe happy Ile; what strength, what art can then\r\nSuffice, or what evasion bear him safe\r\nThrough the strict Senteries and Stations thick\r\nOf Angels watching round?  Here he had need\r\nAll circumspection, and we now no less\r\nChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\r\nThe weight of all and our last hope relies.\r\n\r\nThis said, he sat; and expectation held\r\nHis look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d\r\nTo second, or oppose, or undertake\r\nThe perilous attempt: but all sat mute,\r\nPondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each\r\nIn others count’nance red his own dismay\r\nAstonisht: none among the choice and prime\r\nOf those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found\r\nSo hardie as to proffer or accept\r\nAlone the dreadful voyage; till at last\r\n_Satan_, whom now transcendent glory rais’d\r\nAbove his fellows, with Monarchal pride\r\nConscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.\r\n\r\nO Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones,\r\nWith reason hath deep silence and demurr\r\nSeis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way\r\nAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;\r\nOur prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,\r\nOutrageous to devour, immures us round\r\nNinefold, and gates of burning Adamant\r\nBarr’d over us prohibit all egress.\r\nThese past, if any pass, the void profound\r\nOf unessential Night receives him next\r\nWide gaping, and with utter loss of being\r\nThreatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.\r\nIf thence he scape into what ever world,\r\nOr unknown Region, what remains him less\r\nThen unknown dangers and as hard escape.\r\nBut I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,\r\nAnd this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d\r\nWith splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d\r\nAnd judg’d of public moment, in the shape\r\nOf difficulty or danger could deterre\r\nMe from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume\r\nThese Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,\r\nRefusing to accept as great a share\r\nOf hazard as of honour, due alike\r\nTo him who Reigns, and so much to him due\r\nOf hazard more, as he above the rest\r\nHigh honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,\r\nTerror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,\r\nWhile here shall be our home, what best may ease\r\nThe present misery, and render Hell\r\nMore tollerable; if there be cure or charm\r\nTo respite or deceive, or slack the pain\r\nOf this ill Mansion: intermit no watch\r\nAgainst a wakeful Foe, while I abroad\r\nThrough all the coasts of dark destruction seek\r\nDeliverance for us all: this enterprize\r\nNone shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose\r\nThe Monarch, and prevented all reply,\r\nPrudent, least from his resolution rais’d\r\nOthers among the chief might offer now\r\n(Certain to be refus’d) what erst they feard;\r\nAnd so refus’d might in opinion stand\r\nHis rivals, winning cheap the high repute\r\nWhich he through hazard huge must earn.  But they\r\nDreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice\r\nForbidding; and at once with him they rose;\r\nThir rising all at once was as the sound\r\nOf Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend\r\nWith awful reverence prone; and as a God\r\nExtoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:\r\nNor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d,\r\nThat for the general safety he despis’d\r\nHis own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d\r\nLoose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast\r\nThir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,\r\nOr close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal.\r\nThus they thir doubtful consultations dark\r\nEnded rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:\r\nAs when from mountain tops the dusky clouds\r\nAscending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread\r\nHeav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element\r\nScowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;\r\nIf chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet\r\nExtend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,\r\nThe birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds\r\nAttest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.\r\nO shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn’d\r\nFirm concord holds, men onely disagree\r\nOf Creatures rational, though under hope\r\nOf heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,\r\nYet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife\r\nAmong themselves, and levie cruel warres,\r\nWasting the Earth, each other to destroy:\r\nAs if (which might induce us to accord)\r\nMan had not hellish foes anow besides,\r\nThat day and night for his destruction waite.\r\n\r\nThe _Stygian_ Councel thus dissolv’d; and forth\r\nIn order came the grand infernal Peers,\r\nMidst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd\r\nAlone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less\r\nThen Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,\r\nAnd God-like imitated State; him round\r\nA Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d\r\nWith bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.\r\nThen of thir Session ended they bid cry\r\nWith Trumpets regal sound the great result:\r\nToward the four winds four speedy Cherubim\r\nPut to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie\r\nBy Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss\r\nHeard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell\r\nWith deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim.\r\nThence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d\r\nBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers\r\nDisband, and wandring, each his several way\r\nPursues, as inclination or sad choice\r\nLeads him perplext, where he may likeliest find\r\nTruce to his restless thoughts, and entertain\r\nThe irksome hours, till his great Chief return.\r\nPart on the Plain, or in the Air sublime\r\nUpon the wing, or in swift race contend,\r\nAs at th’ Olympian Games or _Pythian_ fields;\r\nPart curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal\r\nWith rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.\r\nAs when to warn proud Cities warr appears\r\nWag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush\r\nTo Battel in the Clouds, before each Van\r\nPric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears\r\nTill thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms\r\nFrom either end of Heav’n the welkin burns.\r\nOthers with vast _Typhoean_ rage more fell\r\nRend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air\r\nIn whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.\r\nAs when _Alcides_ from _Oealia_ Crown’d\r\nWith conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore\r\nThrough pain up by the roots _Thessalian_ Pines,\r\nAnd _Lichas_ from the top of _Oeta_ threw\r\nInto th’ _Euboic_ Sea.  Others more milde,\r\nRetreated in a silent valley, sing\r\nWith notes Angelical to many a Harp\r\nThir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall\r\nBy doom of Battel; and complain that Fate\r\nFree Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.\r\nThir song was partial, but the harmony\r\n(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)\r\nSuspended Hell, and took with ravishment\r\nThe thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet\r\n(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)\r\nOthers apart sat on a Hill retir’d,\r\nIn thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high\r\nOf Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,\r\nFixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\r\nAnd found no end, in wandring mazes lost.\r\nOf good and evil much they argu’d then,\r\nOf happiness and final misery,\r\nPassion and Apathie, and glory and shame,\r\nVain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:\r\nYet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm\r\nPain for a while or anguish, and excite\r\nFallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest\r\nWith stubborn patience as with triple steel.\r\nAnother part in Squadrons and gross Bands,\r\nOn bold adventure to discover wide\r\nThat dismal world, if any Clime perhaps\r\nMight yeild them easier habitation, bend\r\nFour ways thir flying March, along the Banks\r\nOf four infernal Rivers that disgorge\r\nInto the burning Lake thir baleful streams;\r\nAbhorred _Styx_ the flood of deadly hate,\r\nSad _Acheron_ of sorrow, black and deep;\r\n_Cocytus_, nam’d of lamentation loud\r\nHeard on the ruful stream; fierce _Phlegeton_\r\nWhose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\r\nFarr off from these a slow and silent stream,\r\n_Lethe_ the River of Oblivion roules\r\nHer watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,\r\nForthwith his former state and being forgets,\r\nForgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.\r\nBeyond this flood a frozen Continent\r\nLies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms\r\nOf Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land\r\nThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems\r\nOf ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,\r\nA gulf profound as that _Serbonian_ Bog\r\nBetwixt _Damiata_ and mount _Casius_ old,\r\nWhere Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air\r\nBurns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire.\r\nThither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d,\r\nAt certain revolutions all the damn’d\r\nAre brought: and feel by turns the bitter change\r\nOf fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,\r\nFrom Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice\r\nThir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine\r\nImmovable, infixt, and frozen round,\r\nPeriods of time, thence hurried back to fire.\r\nThey ferry over this _Lethean_ Sound\r\nBoth to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,\r\nAnd wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach\r\nThe tempting stream, with one small drop to loose\r\nIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,\r\nAll in one moment, and so neer the brink;\r\nBut fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt\r\n_Medusa_ with _Gorgonian_ terror guards\r\nThe Ford, and of it self the water flies\r\nAll taste of living wight, as once it fled\r\nThe lip of _Tantalus_.  Thus roving on\r\nIn confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands\r\nWith shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast\r\nView’d first thir lamentable lot, and found\r\nNo rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile\r\nThey pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,\r\nO’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,\r\nRocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,\r\nA Universe of death, which God by curse\r\nCreated evil, for evil only good,\r\nWhere all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,\r\nPerverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,\r\nAbominable, inutterable, and worse\r\nThen Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,\r\n_Gorgons_ and _Hydra’s_, and _Chimera’s_ dire.\r\n\r\nMean while the Adversary of God and Man,\r\n_Satan_ with thoughts inflam’d of highest design,\r\nPuts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell\r\nExplores his solitary flight; som times\r\nHe scours the right hand coast, som times the left,\r\nNow shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares\r\nUp to the fiery concave touring high.\r\nAs when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d\r\nHangs in the Clouds, by _Aequinoctial_ Winds\r\nClose sailing from _Bengala_, or the Iles\r\nOf _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring\r\nThir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood\r\nThrough the wide _Ethiopian_ to the Cape\r\nPly stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem’d\r\nFarr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer\r\nHell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,\r\nAnd thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass\r\nThree Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,\r\nImpenitrable, impal’d with circling fire,\r\nYet unconsum’d.  Before the Gates there sat\r\nOn either side a formidable shape;\r\nThe one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair,\r\nBut ended foul in many a scaly fould\r\nVoluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d\r\nWith mortal sting: about her middle round\r\nA cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d\r\nWith wide _Cerberean_ mouths full loud, and rung\r\nA hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\r\nIf aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb,\r\nAnd kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d\r\nWithin unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these\r\nVex’d _Scylla_ bathing in the Sea that parts\r\n_Calabria_ from the hoarce _Trinacrian_ shore:\r\nNor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d\r\nIn secret, riding through the Air she comes\r\nLur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance\r\nWith _Lapland_ Witches, while the labouring Moon\r\nEclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,\r\nIf shape it might be call’d that shape had none\r\nDistinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,\r\nOr substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,\r\nFor each seem’d either; black it stood as Night,\r\nFierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\r\nAnd shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head\r\nThe likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.\r\n_Satan_ was now at hand, and from his seat\r\nThe Monster moving onward came as fast,\r\nWith horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.\r\nTh’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,\r\nAdmir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except,\r\nCreated thing naught vallu’d he nor shun’d;\r\nAnd with disdainful look thus first began.\r\n\r\nWhence and what art thou, execrable shape,\r\nThat dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance\r\nThy miscreated Front athwart my way\r\nTo yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\r\nThat be assur’d, without leave askt of thee:\r\nRetire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\r\nHell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav’n.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d,\r\nArt thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,\r\nWho first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then\r\nUnbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms\r\nDrew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons\r\nConjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou\r\nAnd they outcast from God, are here condemn’d\r\nTo waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?\r\nAnd reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,\r\nHell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn,\r\nWhere I reign King, and to enrage thee more,\r\nThy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,\r\nFalse fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,\r\nLeast with a whip of Scorpions I pursue\r\nThy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart\r\nStrange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.\r\n\r\nSo spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,\r\nSo speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold\r\nMore dreadful and deform: on th’ other side\r\nIncenc’t with indignation _Satan_ stood\r\nUnterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,\r\nThat fires the length of _Ophiucus_ huge\r\nIn th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair\r\nShakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head\r\nLevel’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands\r\nNo second stroke intend, and such a frown\r\nEach cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds\r\nWith Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on\r\nOver the _Caspian_, then stand front to front\r\nHov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow\r\nTo joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:\r\nSo frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell\r\nGrew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;\r\nFor never but once more was either like\r\nTo meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\r\nHad been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,\r\nHad not the Snakie Sorceress that sat\r\nFast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,\r\nRis’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.\r\n\r\nO Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,\r\nAgainst thy only Son?  What fury O Son,\r\nPossesses thee to bend that mortal Dart\r\nAgainst thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom;\r\nFor him who sits above and laughs the while\r\nAt thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute\r\nWhat e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,\r\nHis wrath which one day will destroy ye both.\r\n\r\nShe spake, and at her words the hellish Pest\r\nForbore, then these to her _Satan_ return’d:\r\n\r\nSo strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\r\nThou interposest, that my sudden hand\r\nPrevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds\r\nWhat it intends; till first I know of thee,\r\nWhat thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why\r\nIn this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st\r\nMe Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son?\r\nI know thee not, nor ever saw till now\r\nSight more detestable then him and thee.\r\n\r\nT’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;\r\nHast thou forgot me then, and do I seem\r\nNow in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair\r\nIn Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight\r\nOf all the Seraphim with thee combin’d\r\nIn bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,\r\nAll on a sudden miserable pain\r\nSurpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm\r\nIn darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast\r\nThrew forth, till on the left side op’ning wide,\r\nLikest to thee in shape and count’nance bright,\r\nThen shining heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d\r\nOut of thy head I sprung: amazement seis’d\r\nAll th’ Host of Heav’n; back they recoild affraid\r\nAt first, and call’d me _Sin_, and for a Sign\r\nPortentous held me; but familiar grown,\r\nI pleas’d, and with attractive graces won\r\nThe most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft\r\nThy self in me thy perfect image viewing\r\nBecam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st\r\nWith me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d\r\nA growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,\r\nAnd fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind\r\n(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe\r\nCleer Victory, to our part loss and rout\r\nThrough all the Empyrean: down they fell\r\nDriv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down\r\nInto this Deep, and in the general fall\r\nI also; at which time this powerful Key\r\nInto my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep\r\nThese Gates for ever shut, which none can pass\r\nWithout my op’ning.  Pensive here I sat\r\nAlone, but long I sat not, till my womb\r\nPregnant by thee, and now excessive grown\r\nProdigious motion felt and rueful throes.\r\nAt last this odious offspring whom thou seest\r\nThine own begotten, breaking violent way\r\nTore through my entrails, that with fear and pain\r\nDistorted, all my nether shape thus grew\r\nTransform’d: but he my inbred enemie\r\nForth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart\r\nMade to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out _Death_;\r\nHell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d\r\nFrom all her Caves, and back resounded _Death_.\r\nI fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems,\r\nInflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far,\r\nMe overtook his mother all dismaid,\r\nAnd in embraces forcible and foule\r\nIngendring with me, of that rape begot\r\nThese yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry\r\nSurround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d\r\nAnd hourly born, with sorrow infinite\r\nTo me, for when they list into the womb\r\nThat bred them they return, and howle and gnaw\r\nMy Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth\r\nAfresh with conscious terrours vex me round,\r\nThat rest or intermission none I find.\r\nBefore mine eyes in opposition sits\r\nGrim _Death_ my Son and foe, who sets them on,\r\nAnd me his Parent would full soon devour\r\nFor want of other prey, but that he knows\r\nHis end with mine involvd; and knows that I\r\nShould prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,\r\nWhen ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.\r\nBut thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun\r\nHis deadly arrow; neither vainly hope\r\nTo be invulnerable in those bright Arms,\r\nThough temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,\r\nSave he who reigns above, none can resist.\r\n\r\nShe finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore\r\nSoon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.\r\nDear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,\r\nAnd my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge\r\nOf dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys\r\nThen sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change\r\nBefalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know\r\nI come no enemie, but to set free\r\nFrom out this dark and dismal house of pain,\r\nBoth him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host\r\nOf Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d\r\nFell with us from on high: from them I go\r\nThis uncouth errand sole, and one for all\r\nMy self expose, with lonely steps to tread\r\nTh’ unfounded deep, & through the void immense\r\nTo search with wandring quest a place foretold\r\nShould be, and, by concurring signs, ere now\r\nCreated vast and round, a place of bliss\r\nIn the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t\r\nA race of upstart Creatures, to supply\r\nPerhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d,\r\nLeast Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude\r\nMight hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught\r\nThen this more secret now design’d, I haste\r\nTo know, and this once known, shall soon return,\r\nAnd bring ye to the place where Thou and Death\r\nShall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\r\nWing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d\r\nWith odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d\r\nImmeasurably, all things shall be your prey.\r\nHe ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death\r\nGrinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear\r\nHis famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe\r\nDestin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d\r\nHis mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.\r\n\r\nThe key of this infernal Pit by due,\r\nAnd by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King\r\nI keep, by him forbidden to unlock\r\nThese Adamantine Gates; against all force\r\nDeath ready stands to interpose his dart,\r\nFearless to be o’rematcht by living might.\r\nBut what ow I to his commands above\r\nWho hates me, and hath hither thrust me down\r\nInto this gloom of _Tartarus_ profound,\r\nTo sit in hateful Office here confin’d,\r\nInhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born,\r\nHere in perpetual agonie and pain,\r\nWith terrors and with clamors compasst round\r\nOf mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:\r\nThou art my Father, thou my Author, thou\r\nMy being gav’st me; whom should I obey\r\nBut thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon\r\nTo that new world of light and bliss, among\r\nThe Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign\r\nAt thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems\r\nThy daughter and thy darling, without end.\r\n\r\nThus saying, from her side the fatal Key,\r\nSad instrument of all our woe, she took;\r\nAnd towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,\r\nForthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,\r\nWhich but her self not all the _Stygian_ powers\r\nCould once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns\r\nTh’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar\r\nOf massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease\r\nUnfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie\r\nWith impetuous recoile and jarring sound\r\nTh’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great\r\nHarsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\r\nOf _Erebus_.  She op’nd, but to shut\r\nExcel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood,\r\nThat with extended wings a Bannerd Host\r\nUnder spread Ensigns marching might pass through\r\nWith Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;\r\nSo wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth\r\nCast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.\r\nBefore thir eyes in sudden view appear\r\nThe secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark\r\nIllimitable Ocean without bound,\r\nWithout dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,\r\nAnd time and place are lost; where eldest Night\r\nAnd _Chaos_, Ancestors of Nature, hold\r\nEternal _Anarchie_, amidst the noise\r\nOf endless warrs and by confusion stand.\r\nFor hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce\r\nStrive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring\r\nThir embryon Atoms; they around the flag\r\nOf each his faction, in thir several Clanns,\r\nLight-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,\r\nSwarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands\r\nOf _Barca_ or _Cyrene’s_ torrid soil,\r\nLevied to side with warring Winds, and poise\r\nThir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,\r\nHee rules a moment; _Chaos_ Umpire sits,\r\nAnd by decision more imbroiles the fray\r\nBy which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter\r\n_Chance_ governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,\r\nThe Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,\r\nOf neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,\r\nBut all these in thir pregnant causes mixt\r\nConfus’dly, and which thus must ever fight,\r\nUnless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain\r\nHis dark materials to create more Worlds,\r\nInto this wilde Abyss the warie fiend\r\nStood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while,\r\nPondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith\r\nHe had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal’d\r\nWith noises loud and ruinous (to compare\r\nGreat things with small) then when _Bellona_ storms,\r\nWith all her battering Engines bent to rase\r\nSom Capital City, or less then if this frame\r\nOf Heav’n were falling, and these Elements\r\nIn mutinie had from her Axle torn\r\nThe stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes\r\nHe spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak\r\nUplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League\r\nAs in a cloudy Chair ascending rides\r\nAudacious, but that seat soon failing, meets\r\nA vast vacuitie: all unawares\r\nFluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops\r\nTen thousand fadom deep, and to this hour\r\nDown had been falling, had not by ill chance\r\nThe strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud\r\nInstinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him\r\nAs many miles aloft: that furie stay’d,\r\nQuencht in a Boggie _Syrtris_, neither Sea,\r\nNor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,\r\nTreading the crude consistence, half on foot,\r\nHalf flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.\r\nAs when a Gryfon through the Wilderness\r\nWith winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,\r\nPursues the _Arimaspian_, who by stelth\r\nHad from his wakeful custody purloind\r\nThe guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend\r\nOre bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\r\nWith head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,\r\nAnd swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:\r\nAt length a universal hubbub wilde\r\nOf stunning sounds and voices all confus’d\r\nBorn through the hollow dark assaults his eare\r\nWith loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,\r\nUndaunted to meet there what ever power\r\nOr Spirit of the nethermost Abyss\r\nMight in that noise reside, of whom to ask\r\nWhich way the neerest coast of darkness lyes\r\nBordering on light; when strait behold the Throne\r\nOf _Chaos_, and his dark Pavilion spread\r\nWide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d\r\nSat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,\r\nThe consort of his Reign; and by them stood\r\n_Orcus_ and _Ades_, and the dreaded name\r\nOf _Demogorgon_; Rumor next and Chance,\r\nAnd Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,\r\nAnd Discord with a thousand various mouths.\r\n\r\nT’ whom _Satan_ turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers\r\nAnd Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,\r\n_Chaos_ and _Ancient Night_, I come no Spie,\r\nWith purpose to explore or to disturb\r\nThe secrets of your Realm, but by constraint\r\nWandring this darksome desart, as my way\r\nLies through your spacious Empire up to light,\r\nAlone, and without guide, half lost, I seek\r\nWhat readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds\r\nConfine with Heav’n; or if som other place\r\nFrom your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King\r\nPossesses lately, thither to arrive\r\nI travel this profound, direct my course;\r\nDirected, no mean recompence it brings\r\nTo your behoof, if I that Region lost,\r\nAll usurpation thence expell’d, reduce\r\nTo her original darkness and your sway\r\n(Which is my present journey) and once more\r\nErect the Standerd there of _Ancient Night_;\r\nYours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.\r\n\r\nThus _Satan_; and him thus the Anarch old\r\nWith faultring speech and visage incompos’d\r\nAnswer’d.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art,\r\nThat mighty leading Angel, who of late\r\nMade head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown.\r\nI saw and heard, for such a numerous host\r\nFled not in silence through the frighted deep\r\nWith ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,\r\nConfusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates\r\nPourd out by millions her victorious Bands\r\nPursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here\r\nKeep residence; if all I can will serve,\r\nThat little which is left so to defend\r\nEncroacht on still through our intestine broiles\r\nWeakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell\r\nYour dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;\r\nNow lately Heaven and Earth, another World\r\nHung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain\r\nTo that side Heav’n from whence your Legions fell:\r\nIf that way be your walk, you have not farr;\r\nSo much the neerer danger; goe and speed;\r\nHavock and spoil and ruin are my gain.\r\n\r\nHe ceas’d; and _Satan_ staid not to reply,\r\nBut glad that now his Sea should find a shore,\r\nWith fresh alacritie and force renew’d\r\nSprings upward like a Pyramid of fire\r\nInto the wilde expanse, and through the shock\r\nOf fighting Elements, on all sides round\r\nEnviron’d wins his way; harder beset\r\nAnd more endanger’d, then when _Argo_ pass’d\r\nThrough _Bosporus_ betwixt the justling Rocks:\r\nOr when _Ulysses_ on the Larbord shunnd\r\n_Charybdis_, and by th’ other whirlpool steard.\r\nSo he with difficulty and labour hard\r\nMov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee;\r\nBut hee once past, soon after when man fell,\r\nStrange alteration!  Sin and Death amain\r\nFollowing his track, such was the will of Heav’n,\r\nPav’d after him a broad and beat’n way\r\nOver the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf\r\nTamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length\r\nFrom Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe\r\nOf this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse\r\nWith easie intercourse pass to and fro\r\nTo tempt or punish mortals, except whom\r\nGod and good Angels guard by special grace.\r\nBut now at last the sacred influence\r\nOf light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n\r\nShoots farr into the bosom of dim Night\r\nA glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins\r\nHer fardest verge, and _Chaos_ to retire\r\nAs from her outmost works a brok’n foe\r\nWith tumult less and with less hostile din,\r\nThat _Satan_ with less toil, and now with ease\r\nWafts on the calmer wave by dubious light\r\nAnd like a weather-beaten Vessel holds\r\nGladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;\r\nOr in the emptier waste, resembling Air,\r\nWeighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold\r\nFarr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide\r\nIn circuit, undetermind square or round,\r\nWith Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d\r\nOf living Saphire, once his native Seat;\r\nAnd fast by hanging in a golden Chain\r\nThis pendant world, in bigness as a Starr\r\nOf smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.\r\nThither full fraught with mischievous revenge,\r\nAccurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.\r\n\r\n      THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK III.\r\n\r\nHail holy light, ofspring of Heav’n first-born,\r\nOr of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam\r\nMay I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,\r\nAnd never but in unapproached light\r\nDwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,\r\nBright effluence of bright essence increate.\r\nOr hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,\r\nWhose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,\r\nBefore the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice\r\nOf God, as with a Mantle didst invest\r\nThe rising world of waters dark and deep,\r\nWon from the void and formless infinite.\r\nThee I re-visit now with bolder wing,\r\nEscap’t the _Stygian_ Pool, though long detain’d\r\nIn that obscure sojourn, while in my flight\r\nThrough utter and through middle darkness borne\r\nWith other notes then to th’ _Orphean_ Lyre\r\nI sung of _Chaos_ and _Eternal Night_,\r\nTaught by the heav’nly Muse to venture down\r\nThe dark descent, and up to reascend,\r\nThough hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,\r\nAnd feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou\r\nRevisit’st not these eyes, that rowle in vain\r\nTo find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;\r\nSo thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,\r\nOr dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more\r\nCease I to wander where the Muses haunt\r\nCleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,\r\nSmit with the love of sacred song; but chief\r\nThee _Sion_ and the flowrie Brooks beneath\r\nThat wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,\r\nNightly I visit: nor somtimes forget\r\nThose other two equal’d with me in Fate,\r\nSo were I equal’d with them in renown,\r\nBlind _Thamyris_ and blind _Maeonides_,\r\nAnd _Tiresias_ and _Phineus_ Prophets old.\r\nThen feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move\r\nHarmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird\r\nSings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid\r\nTunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year\r\nSeasons return, but not to me returns\r\nDay, or the sweet approach of Ev’n or Morn,\r\nOr sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,\r\nOr flocks, or herds, or human face divine;\r\nBut cloud in stead, and ever-during dark\r\nSurrounds me, from the chearful waies of men\r\nCut off, and for the book of knowledg fair\r\nPresented with a Universal blanc\r\nOf Natures works to mee expung’d and ras’d,\r\nAnd wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.\r\nSo much the rather thou Celestial light\r\nShine inward, and the mind through all her powers\r\nIrradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence\r\nPurge and disperse, that I may see and tell\r\nOf things invisible to mortal sight.\r\n\r\nNow had the Almighty Father from above,\r\nFrom the pure Empyrean where he sits\r\nHigh Thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye,\r\nHis own works and their works at once to view:\r\nAbout him all the Sanctities of Heaven\r\nStood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv’d\r\nBeatitude past utterance; on his right\r\nThe radiant image of his Glory sat,\r\nHis onely Son; On Earth he first beheld\r\nOur two first Parents, yet the onely two\r\nOf mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t,\r\nReaping immortal fruits of joy and love,\r\nUninterrupted joy, unrivald love\r\nIn blissful solitude; he then survey’d\r\nHell and the Gulf between, and _Satan_ there\r\nCoasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night\r\nIn the dun Air sublime, and ready now\r\nTo stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet\r\nOn the bare outside of this World, that seem’d\r\nFirm land imbosom’d without Firmament,\r\nUncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.\r\nHim God beholding from his prospect high,\r\nWherein past, present, future he beholds,\r\nThus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.\r\n\r\nOnely begotten Son, seest thou what rage\r\nTransports our adversarie, whom no bounds\r\nPrescrib’d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains\r\nHeapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss\r\nWide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems\r\nOn desperat revenge, that shall redound\r\nUpon his own rebellious head.  And now\r\nThrough all restraint broke loose he wings his way\r\nNot farr off Heav’n, in the Precincts of light,\r\nDirectly towards the new created World,\r\nAnd Man there plac’t, with purpose to assay\r\nIf him by force he can destroy, or worse,\r\nBy som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;\r\nFor man will heark’n to his glozing lyes,\r\nAnd easily transgress the sole Command,\r\nSole pledge of his obedience: So will fall\r\nHee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?\r\nWhose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee\r\nAll he could have; I made him just and right,\r\nSufficient to have stood, though free to fall.\r\nSuch I created all th’ Ethereal Powers\r\nAnd Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild;\r\nFreely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.\r\nNot free, what proof could they have givn sincere\r\nOf true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,\r\nWhere onely what they needs must do, appeard,\r\nNot what they would? what praise could they receive?\r\nWhat pleasure I from such obedience paid,\r\nWhen Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)\r\nUseless and vain, of freedom both despoild,\r\nMade passive both, had servd necessitie,\r\nNot mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,\r\nSo were created, nor can justly accuse\r\nThir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;\r\nAs if Predestination over-rul’d\r\nThir will, dispos’d by absolute Decree\r\nOr high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed\r\nThir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,\r\nForeknowledge had no influence on their fault,\r\nWhich had no less prov’d certain unforeknown.\r\nSo without least impulse or shadow of Fate,\r\nOr aught by me immutablie foreseen,\r\nThey trespass, Authors to themselves in all\r\nBoth what they judge and what they choose; for so\r\nI formd them free, and free they must remain,\r\nTill they enthrall themselves: I else must change\r\nThir nature, and revoke the high Decree\r\nUnchangeable, Eternal, which ordain’d\r\nThir freedom, they themselves ordain’d thir fall.\r\nThe first sort by thir own suggestion fell,\r\nSelf-tempted, self-deprav’d: Man falls deceiv’d\r\nBy the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,\r\nThe other none: in Mercy and Justice both,\r\nThrough Heav’n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,\r\nBut Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.\r\n\r\nThus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d\r\nAll Heav’n, and in the blessed Spirits elect\r\nSense of new joy ineffable diffus’d:\r\nBeyond compare the Son of God was seen\r\nMost glorious, in him all his Father shon\r\nSubstantially express’d, and in his face\r\nDivine compassion visibly appeerd,\r\nLove without end, and without measure Grace,\r\nWhich uttering thus he to his Father spake.\r\n\r\nO Father, gracious was that word which clos’d\r\nThy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;\r\nFor which both Heav’n and Earth shall high extoll\r\nThy praises, with th’ innumerable sound\r\nOf Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne\r\nEncompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.\r\nFor should Man finally be lost, should Man\r\nThy creature late so lov’d, thy youngest Son\r\nFall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd\r\nWith his own folly? that be from thee farr,\r\nThat farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge\r\nOf all things made, and judgest onely right.\r\nOr shall the Adversarie thus obtain\r\nHis end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill\r\nHis malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,\r\nOr proud return though to his heavier doom,\r\nYet with revenge accomplish’t and to Hell\r\nDraw after him the whole Race of mankind,\r\nBy him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self\r\nAbolish thy Creation, and unmake,\r\nFor him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?\r\nSo should thy goodness and thy greatness both\r\nBe questiond and blaspheam’d without defence.\r\n\r\nTo whom the great Creatour thus reply’d.\r\nO Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,\r\nSon of my bosom, Son who art alone\r\nMy word, my wisdom, and effectual might,\r\nAll hast thou spok’n as my thoughts are, all\r\nAs my Eternal purpose hath decreed:\r\nMan shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will,\r\nYet not of will in him, but grace in me\r\nFreely voutsaft; once more I will renew\r\nHis lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall’d\r\nBy sin to foul exorbitant desires;\r\nUpheld by me, yet once more he shall stand\r\nOn even ground against his mortal foe,\r\nBy me upheld, that he may know how frail\r\nHis fall’n condition is, and to me ow\r\nAll his deliv’rance, and to none but me.\r\nSome I have chosen of peculiar grace\r\nElect above the rest; so is my will:\r\nThe rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd\r\nThir sinful state, and to appease betimes\r\nTh’ incensed Deitie, while offerd grace\r\nInvites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,\r\nWhat may suffice, and soft’n stonie hearts\r\nTo pray, repent, and bring obedience due.\r\nTo prayer, repentance, and obedience due,\r\nThough but endevord with sincere intent,\r\nMine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.\r\nAnd I will place within them as a guide\r\nMy Umpire _Conscience_, whom if they will hear,\r\nLight after light well us’d they shall attain,\r\nAnd to the end persisting, safe arrive.\r\nThis my long sufferance and my day of grace\r\nThey who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;\r\nBut hard be hard’nd, blind be blinded more,\r\nThat they may stumble on, and deeper fall;\r\nAnd none but such from mercy I exclude.\r\nBut yet all is not don; Man disobeying,\r\nDisloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns\r\nAgainst the high Supremacie of Heav’n,\r\nAffecting God-head, and so loosing all,\r\nTo expiate his Treason hath naught left,\r\nBut to destruction sacred and devote,\r\nHe with his whole posteritie must die,\r\nDie hee or Justice must; unless for him\r\nSom other able, and as willing, pay\r\nThe rigid satisfaction, death for death.\r\nSay Heav’nly Powers, where shall we find such love,\r\nWhich of ye will be mortal to redeem\r\nMans mortal crime, and just th’ unjust to save,\r\nDwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?\r\n\r\nHe ask’d, but all the Heav’nly Quire stood mute,\r\nAnd silence was in Heav’n: on mans behalf\r\nPatron or Intercessor none appeerd,\r\nMuch less that durst upon his own head draw\r\nThe deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.\r\nAnd now without redemption all mankind\r\nMust have bin lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell\r\nBy doom severe, had not the Son of God,\r\nIn whom the fulness dwels of love divine,\r\nHis dearest mediation thus renewd.\r\n\r\nFather, thy word is past, man shall find grace;\r\nAnd shall grace not find means, that finds her way,\r\nThe speediest of thy winged messengers,\r\nTo visit all thy creatures, and to all\r\nComes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought,\r\nHappie for man, so coming; he her aide\r\nCan never seek, once dead in sins and lost;\r\nAttonement for himself or offering meet,\r\nIndebted and undon, hath none to bring:\r\nBehold mee then, mee for him, life for life\r\nI offer, on mee let thine anger fall;\r\nAccount mee man; I for his sake will leave\r\nThy bosom, and this glorie next to thee\r\nFreely put off, and for him lastly die\r\nWell pleas’d, on me let Death wreck all his rage;\r\nUnder his gloomie power I shall not long\r\nLie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess\r\nLife in my self for ever, by thee I live,\r\nThough now to Death I yeild, and am his due\r\nAll that of me can die, yet that debt paid,\r\nThou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave\r\nHis prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule\r\nFor ever with corruption there to dwell;\r\nBut I shall rise Victorious, and subdue\r\nMy Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;\r\nDeath his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop\r\nInglorious, of his mortall sting disarm’d.\r\nI through the ample Air in Triumph high\r\nShall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show\r\nThe powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight\r\nPleas’d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,\r\nWhile by thee rais’d I ruin all my Foes,\r\nDeath last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:\r\nThen with the multitude of my redeemd\r\nShall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,\r\nFather, to see thy face, wherein no cloud\r\nOf anger shall remain, but peace assur’d,\r\nAnd reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more\r\nThenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.\r\n\r\nHis words here ended, but his meek aspect\r\nSilent yet spake, and breath’d immortal love\r\nTo mortal men, above which only shon\r\nFilial obedience: as a sacrifice\r\nGlad to be offer’d, he attends the will\r\nOf his great Father.  Admiration seis’d\r\nAll Heav’n, what this might mean, & whither tend\r\nWondring; but soon th’ Almighty thus reply’d:\r\n\r\nO thou in Heav’n and Earth the only peace\r\nFound out for mankind under wrauth, O thou\r\nMy sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear,\r\nTo me are all my works, nor Man the least\r\nThough last created, that for him I spare\r\nThee from my bosom and right hand, to save,\r\nBy loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.\r\nThou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,\r\nThir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;\r\nAnd be thy self Man among men on Earth,\r\nMade flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,\r\nBy wondrous birth: Be thou in _Adams_ room\r\nThe Head of all mankind, though _Adams_ Son.\r\nAs in him perish all men, so in thee\r\nAs from a second root shall be restor’d,\r\nAs many as are restor’d, without thee none.\r\nHis crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit\r\nImputed shall absolve them who renounce\r\nThir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,\r\nAnd live in thee transplanted, and from thee\r\nReceive new life.  So Man, as is most just,\r\nShall satisfie for Man, be judg’d and die,\r\nAnd dying rise, and rising with him raise\r\nHis Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.\r\nSo Heav’nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,\r\nGiving to death, and dying to redeeme,\r\nSo dearly to redeem what Hellish hate\r\nSo easily destroy’d, and still destroyes\r\nIn those who, when they may, accept not grace.\r\nNor shalt thou by descending to assume\r\nMans Nature, less’n or degrade thine owne.\r\nBecause thou hast, though Thron’d in highest bliss\r\nEqual to God, and equally enjoying\r\nGod-like fruition, quitted all to save\r\nA World from utter loss, and hast been found\r\nBy Merit more then Birthright Son of God,\r\nFound worthiest to be so by being Good,\r\nFarr more then Great or High; because in thee\r\nLove hath abounded more then Glory abounds,\r\nTherefore thy Humiliation shall exalt\r\nWith thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;\r\nHere shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne\r\nBoth God and Man, Son both of God and Man,\r\nAnointed universal King; all Power\r\nI give thee, reign for ever, and assume\r\nThy Merits; under thee as Head Supream\r\nThrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:\r\nAll knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide\r\nIn Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;\r\nWhen thou attended gloriously from Heav’n\r\nShalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send\r\nThe summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime\r\nThy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes\r\nThe living, and forthwith the cited dead\r\nOf all past Ages to the general Doom\r\nShall hast’n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.\r\nThen all thy Saints assembl’d, thou shalt judge\r\nBad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink\r\nBeneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,\r\nThenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while\r\nThe World shall burn, and from her ashes spring\r\nNew Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell\r\nAnd after all thir tribulations long\r\nSee golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,\r\nWith Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.\r\nThen thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,\r\nFor regal Scepter then no more shall need,\r\nGod shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,\r\nAdore him, who to compass all this dies,\r\nAdore the Son, and honour him as mee.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had th’ Almighty ceas’t, but all\r\nThe multitude of Angels with a shout\r\nLoud as from numbers without number, sweet\r\nAs from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav’n rung\r\nWith Jubilee, and loud Hosanna’s fill’d\r\nTh’ eternal Regions: lowly reverent\r\nTowards either Throne they bow, & to the ground\r\nWith solemn adoration down they cast\r\nThir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,\r\nImmortal Amarant, a Flour which once\r\nIn Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life\r\nBegan to bloom, but soon for mans offence\r\nTo Heav’n remov’d where first it grew, there grows,\r\nAnd flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,\r\nAnd where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn\r\nRowls o’re _Elisian_ Flours her Amber stream;\r\nWith these that never fade the Spirits Elect\r\nBind thir resplendent locks inwreath’d with beams,\r\nNow in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright\r\nPavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon\r\nImpurpl’d with Celestial Roses smil’d.\r\nThen Crown’d again thir gold’n Harps they took,\r\nHarps ever tun’d, that glittering by their side\r\nLike Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet\r\nOf charming symphonie they introduce\r\nThir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;\r\nNo voice exempt, no voice but well could joine\r\nMelodious part, such concord is in Heav’n.\r\n\r\nThee Father first they sung Omnipotent,\r\nImmutable, Immortal, Infinite,\r\nEternal King; thee Author of all being,\r\nFountain of Light, thy self invisible\r\nAmidst the glorious brightness where thou sit’st\r\nThron’d inaccessible, but when thou shad’st\r\nThe full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud\r\nDrawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,\r\nDark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,\r\nYet dazle Heav’n, that brightest Seraphim\r\nApproach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.\r\nThee next they sang of all Creation first,\r\nBegotten Son, Divine Similitude,\r\nIn whose conspicuous count’nance, without cloud\r\nMade visible, th’ Almighty Father shines,\r\nWhom else no Creature can behold; on thee\r\nImpresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,\r\nTransfus’d on thee his ample Spirit rests.\r\nHee Heav’n of Heavens and all the Powers therein\r\nBy thee created, and by thee threw down\r\nTh’ aspiring Dominations: thou that day\r\nThy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,\r\nNor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook\r\nHeav’ns everlasting Frame, while o’re the necks\r\nThou drov’st of warring Angels disarraid.\r\nBack from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime\r\nThee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,\r\nTo execute fierce vengeance on his foes,\r\nNot so on Man; him through their malice fall’n,\r\nFather of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome\r\nSo strictly, but much more to pitie encline:\r\nNo sooner did thy dear and onely Son\r\nPerceive thee purpos’d not to doom frail Man\r\nSo strictly, but much more to pitie enclin’d,\r\nHe to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife\r\nOf Mercy and Justice in thy face discern’d,\r\nRegardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat\r\nSecond to thee, offerd himself to die\r\nFor mans offence.  O unexampl’d love,\r\nLove no where to be found less then Divine!\r\nHail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name\r\nShall be the copious matter of my Song\r\nHenceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise\r\nForget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.\r\n\r\nThus they in Heav’n, above the starry Sphear,\r\nThir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.\r\nMean while upon the firm opacous Globe\r\nOf this round World, whose first convex divides\r\nThe luminous inferior Orbs, enclos’d\r\nFrom _Chaos_ and th’ inroad of Darkness old,\r\n_Satan_ alighted walks: a Globe farr off\r\nIt seem’d, now seems a boundless Continent\r\nDark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night\r\nStarless expos’d, and ever-threatning storms\r\nOf _Chaos_ blustring round, inclement skie;\r\nSave on that side which from the wall of Heav’n\r\nThough distant farr som small reflection gaines\r\nOf glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:\r\nHere walk’d the Fiend at large in spacious field.\r\nAs when a Vultur on _Imaus_ bred,\r\nWhose snowie ridge the roving _Tartar_ bounds,\r\nDislodging from a Region scarce of prey\r\nTo gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids\r\nOn Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs\r\nOf _Ganges_ or _Hydaspes, Indian_ streams;\r\nBut in his way lights on the barren plaines\r\nOf _Sericana_, where _Chineses_ drive\r\nWith Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:\r\nSo on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend\r\nWalk’d up and down alone bent on his prey,\r\nAlone, for other Creature in this place\r\nLiving or liveless to be found was none,\r\nNone yet, but store hereafter from the earth\r\nUp hither like Aereal vapours flew\r\nOf all things transitorie and vain, when Sin\r\nWith vanity had filld the works of men:\r\nBoth all things vain, and all who in vain things\r\nBuilt thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,\r\nOr happiness in this or th’ other life;\r\nAll who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits\r\nOf painful Superstition and blind Zeal,\r\nNaught seeking but the praise of men, here find\r\nFit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;\r\nAll th’ unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,\r\nAbortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,\r\nDissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,\r\nTill final dissolution, wander here,\r\nNot in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;\r\nThose argent Fields more likely habitants,\r\nTranslated Saints, or middle Spirits hold\r\nBetwixt th’ Angelical and Human kinde:\r\nHither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born\r\nFirst from the ancient World those Giants came\r\nWith many a vain exploit, though then renownd:\r\nThe builders next of _Babel_ on the Plain\r\nOf _Sennaar_, and still with vain designe\r\nNew _Babels_, had they wherewithall, would build:\r\nOthers came single; hee who to be deemd\r\nA God, leap’d fondly into _Aetna_ flames,\r\n_Empedocles_, and hee who to enjoy\r\n_Plato’s Elysium_, leap’d into the Sea,\r\n_Cleombrotus_, and many more too long,\r\nEmbryo’s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers\r\nWhite, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.\r\nHere Pilgrims roam, that stray’d so farr to seek\r\nIn _Golgotha_ him dead, who lives in Heav’n;\r\nAnd they who to be sure of Paradise\r\nDying put on the weeds of _Dominic_,\r\nOr in _Franciscan_ think to pass disguis’d;\r\nThey pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,\r\nAnd that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs\r\nThe Trepidation talkt, and that first mov’d;\r\nAnd now Saint _Peter_ at Heav’ns Wicket seems\r\nTo wait them with his Keys, and now at foot\r\nOf Heav’ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe\r\nA violent cross wind from either Coast\r\nBlows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry\r\nInto the devious Air; then might ye see\r\nCowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost\r\nAnd flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,\r\nIndulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,\r\nThe sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft\r\nFly o’re the backside of the World farr off\r\nInto a _Limbo_ large and broad, since calld\r\nThe Paradise of Fools, to few unknown\r\nLong after, now unpeopl’d, and untrod;\r\nAll this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass’d,\r\nAnd long he wanderd, till at last a gleame\r\nOf dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste\r\nHis travell’d steps; farr distant hee descries\r\nAscending by degrees magnificent\r\nUp to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,\r\nAt top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd\r\nThe work as of a Kingly Palace Gate\r\nWith Frontispice of Diamond and Gold\r\nImbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes\r\nThe Portal shon, inimitable on Earth\r\nBy Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.\r\nThe Stairs were such as whereon _Jacob_ saw\r\nAngels ascending and descending, bands\r\nOf Guardians bright, when he from _Esau_ fled\r\nTo _Padan-Aram_ in the field of _Luz_,\r\nDreaming by night under the open Skie,\r\nAnd waking cri’d, This is the Gate of Heav’n.\r\nEach Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood\r\nThere alwaies, but drawn up to Heav’n somtimes\r\nViewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow’d\r\nOf Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon\r\nWho after came from Earth, sayling arriv’d,\r\nWafted by Angels, or flew o’re the Lake\r\nRapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.\r\nThe Stairs were then let down, whether to dare\r\nThe Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate\r\nHis sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.\r\nDirect against which op’nd from beneath,\r\nJust o’re the blissful seat of Paradise,\r\nA passage down to th’ Earth, a passage wide,\r\nWider by farr then that of after-times\r\nOver Mount _Sion_, and, though that were large,\r\nOver the _Promis’d Land_ to God so dear,\r\nBy which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,\r\nOn high behests his Angels to and fro\r\nPass’d frequent, and his eye with choice regard\r\nFrom _Paneas_ the fount of _Jordans_ flood\r\nTo _Beersaba_, where the _Holy Land_\r\nBorders on _Aegypt_ and the _Arabian_ shoare;\r\nSo wide the op’ning seemd, where bounds were set\r\nTo darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.\r\n_Satan_ from hence now on the lower stair\r\nThat scal’d by steps of Gold to Heav’n Gate\r\nLooks down with wonder at the sudden view\r\nOf all this World at once.  As when a Scout\r\nThrough dark and desart wayes with peril gone\r\nAll night; at last by break of chearful dawne\r\nObtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,\r\nWhich to his eye discovers unaware\r\nThe goodly prospect of some forein land\r\nFirst-seen, or some renownd Metropolis\r\nWith glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,\r\nWhich now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.\r\nSuch wonder seis’d, though after Heaven seen,\r\nThe Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis’d\r\nAt sight of all this World beheld so faire.\r\nRound he surveys, and well might, where he stood\r\nSo high above the circling Canopie\r\nOf Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point\r\nOf _Libra_ to the fleecie Starr that bears\r\n_Andromeda_ farr off _Atlantick_ Seas\r\nBeyond th’ _Horizon_; then from Pole to Pole\r\nHe views in bredth, and without longer pause\r\nDown right into the Worlds first Region throws\r\nHis flight precipitant, and windes with ease\r\nThrough the pure marble Air his oblique way\r\nAmongst innumerable Starrs, that shon\r\nStars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,\r\nOr other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,\r\nLike those _Hesperian_ Gardens fam’d of old,\r\nFortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,\r\nThrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there\r\nHe stayd not to enquire: above them all\r\nThe golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven\r\nAllur’d his eye: Thither his course he bends\r\nThrough the calm Firmament; but up or downe\r\nBy center, or eccentric, hard to tell,\r\nOr Longitude, where the great Luminarie\r\nAlooff the vulgar Constellations thick,\r\nThat from his Lordly eye keep distance due,\r\nDispenses Light from farr; they as they move\r\nThir Starry dance in numbers that compute\r\nDays, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp\r\nTurn swift their various motions, or are turnd\r\nBy his Magnetic beam, that gently warms\r\nThe Univers, and to each inward part\r\nWith gentle penetration, though unseen,\r\nShoots invisible vertue even to the deep:\r\nSo wondrously was set his Station bright.\r\nThere lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps\r\nAstronomer in the Sun’s lucent Orbe\r\nThrough his glaz’d Optic Tube yet never saw.\r\nThe place he found beyond expression bright,\r\nCompar’d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;\r\nNot all parts like, but all alike informd\r\nWith radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;\r\nIf mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;\r\nIf stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,\r\nRubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon\r\nIn _Aarons_ Brest-plate, and a stone besides\r\nImagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,\r\nThat stone, or like to that which here below\r\nPhilosophers in vain so long have sought,\r\nIn vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde\r\nVolatil _Hermes_, and call up unbound\r\nIn various shapes old _Proteus_ from the Sea,\r\nDraind through a Limbec to his Native forme.\r\nWhat wonder then if fields and regions here\r\nBreathe forth _Elixir_ pure, and Rivers run\r\nPotable Gold, when with one vertuous touch\r\nTh’ Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote\r\nProduces with Terrestrial Humor mixt\r\nHere in the dark so many precious things\r\nOf colour glorious and effect so rare?\r\nHere matter new to gaze the Devil met\r\nUndazl’d, farr and wide his eye commands,\r\nFor sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,\r\nBut all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon\r\nCulminate from th’ _Aequator_, as they now\r\nShot upward still direct, whence no way round\r\nShadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,\r\nNo where so cleer, sharp’nd his visual ray\r\nTo objects distant farr, whereby he soon\r\nSaw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,\r\nThe same whom _John_ saw also in the Sun:\r\nHis back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;\r\nOf beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar\r\nCircl’d his Head, nor less his Locks behind\r\nIllustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings\r\nLay waving round; on som great charge imploy’d\r\nHee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.\r\nGlad was the Spirit impure as now in hope\r\nTo find who might direct his wandring flight\r\nTo Paradise the happie seat of Man,\r\nHis journies end and our beginning woe.\r\nBut first he casts to change his proper shape,\r\nWhich else might work him danger or delay:\r\nAnd now a stripling Cherube he appeers,\r\nNot of the prime, yet such as in his face\r\nYouth smil’d Celestial, and to every Limb\r\nSutable grace diffus’d, so well he feignd;\r\nUnder a Coronet his flowing haire\r\nIn curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore\r\nOf many a colourd plume sprinkl’d with Gold,\r\nHis habit fit for speed succinct, and held\r\nBefore his decent steps a Silver wand.\r\nHe drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,\r\nEre he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,\r\nAdmonisht by his eare, and strait was known\r\nTh’ Arch-Angel _Uriel_, one of the seav’n\r\nWho in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne\r\nStand ready at command, and are his Eyes\r\nThat run through all the Heav’ns, or down to th’ Earth\r\nBear his swift errands over moist and dry,\r\nO’re Sea and Land: him _Satan_ thus accostes;\r\n\r\n_Uriel_, for thou of those seav’n Spirits that stand\r\nIn sight of God’s high Throne, gloriously bright,\r\nThe first art wont his great authentic will\r\nInterpreter through highest Heav’n to bring,\r\nWhere all his Sons thy Embassie attend;\r\nAnd here art likeliest by supream decree\r\nLike honour to obtain, and as his Eye\r\nTo visit oft this new Creation round;\r\nUnspeakable desire to see, and know\r\nAll these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,\r\nHis chief delight and favour, him for whom\r\nAll these his works so wondrous he ordaind,\r\nHath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim\r\nAlone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell\r\nIn which of all these shining Orbes hath Man\r\nHis fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,\r\nBut all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;\r\nThat I may find him, and with secret gaze,\r\nOr open admiration him behold\r\nOn whom the great Creator hath bestowd\r\nWorlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;\r\nThat both in him and all things, as is meet,\r\nThe Universal Maker we may praise;\r\nWho justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes\r\nTo deepest Hell, and to repair that loss\r\nCreated this new happie Race of Men\r\nTo serve him better: wise are all his wayes.\r\n\r\nSo spake the false dissembler unperceivd;\r\nFor neither Man nor Angel can discern\r\nHypocrisie, the only evil that walks\r\nInvisible, except to God alone,\r\nBy his permissive will, through Heav’n and Earth:\r\nAnd oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps\r\nAt wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie\r\nResigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill\r\nWhere no ill seems: Which now for once beguil’d\r\n_Uriel_, though Regent of the Sun, and held\r\nThe sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav’n;\r\nWho to the fraudulent Impostor foule\r\nIn his uprightness answer thus returnd.\r\nFaire Angel, thy desire which tends to know\r\nThe works of God, thereby to glorifie\r\nThe great Work-Maister, leads to no excess\r\nThat reaches blame, but rather merits praise\r\nThe more it seems excess, that led thee hither\r\nFrom thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,\r\nTo witness with thine eyes what some perhaps\r\nContented with report heare onely in heav’n:\r\nFor wonderful indeed are all his works,\r\nPleasant to know, and worthiest to be all\r\nHad in remembrance alwayes with delight;\r\nBut what created mind can comprehend\r\nThir number, or the wisdom infinite\r\nThat brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.\r\nI saw when at his Word the formless Mass,\r\nThis worlds material mould, came to a heap:\r\nConfusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar\r\nStood rul’d, stood vast infinitude confin’d;\r\nTill at his second bidding darkness fled,\r\nLight shon, and order from disorder sprung:\r\nSwift to thir several Quarters hasted then\r\nThe cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,\r\nAnd this Ethereal quintessence of Heav’n\r\nFlew upward, spirited with various forms,\r\nThat rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs\r\nNumberless, as thou seest, and how they move;\r\nEach had his place appointed, each his course,\r\nThe rest in circuit walles this Universe.\r\nLook downward on that Globe whose hither side\r\nWith light from hence, though but reflected, shines;\r\nThat place is Earth the seat of Man, that light\r\nHis day, which else as th’ other Hemisphere\r\nNight would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon\r\n(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide\r\nTimely interposes, and her monthly round\r\nStill ending, still renewing, through mid Heav’n;\r\nWith borrowd light her countenance triform\r\nHence fills and empties to enlighten th’ Earth,\r\nAnd in her pale dominion checks the night.\r\nThat spot to which I point is _Paradise_,\r\n_Adams_ abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.\r\nThy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.\r\n\r\nThus said, he turnd, and _Satan_ bowing low,\r\nAs to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,\r\nWhere honour due and reverence none neglects,\r\nTook leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,\r\nDown from th’ Ecliptic, sped with hop’d success,\r\nThrows his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,\r\nNor staid, till on _Niphates_ top he lights.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK IV.\r\n\r\nO For that warning voice, which he who saw\r\nTh’ _Apocalyps_, heard cry in Heaven aloud,\r\nThen when the Dragon, put to second rout,\r\nCame furious down to be reveng’d on men,\r\n_Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth!_ that now,\r\nWhile time was, our first Parents had bin warnd\r\nThe coming of thir secret foe, and scap’d\r\nHaply so scap’d his mortal snare; for now\r\n_Satan_, now first inflam’d with rage, came down,\r\nThe Tempter ere th’ Accuser of man-kind,\r\nTo wreck on innocent frail man his loss\r\nOf that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:\r\nYet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,\r\nFar off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,\r\nBegins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth\r\nNow rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,\r\nAnd like a devillish Engine back recoiles\r\nUpon himself; horror and doubt distract\r\nHis troubl’d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr\r\nThe Hell within him, for within him Hell\r\nHe brings, and round about him, nor from Hell\r\nOne step no more then from himself can fly\r\nBy change of place: Now conscience wakes despair\r\nThat slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie\r\nOf what he was, what is, and what must be\r\nWorse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.\r\nSometimes towards _Eden_ which now in his view\r\nLay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,\r\nSometimes towards Heav’n and the full-blazing Sun,\r\nWhich now sat high in his Meridian Towre:\r\nThen much revolving, thus in sighs began.\r\n\r\nO thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,\r\nLook’st from thy sole Dominion like the God\r\nOf this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs\r\nHide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,\r\nBut with no friendly voice, and add thy name\r\nO Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams\r\nThat bring to my remembrance from what state\r\nI fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;\r\nTill Pride and worse Ambition threw me down\r\nWarring in Heav’n against Heav’ns matchless King:\r\nAh wherefore! he deservd no such return\r\nFrom me, whom he created what I was\r\nIn that bright eminence, and with his good\r\nUpbraided none; nor was his service hard.\r\nWhat could be less then to afford him praise,\r\nThe easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,\r\nHow due! yet all his good prov’d ill in me,\r\nAnd wrought but malice; lifted up so high\r\nI sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher\r\nWould set me highest, and in a moment quit\r\nThe debt immense of endless gratitude,\r\nSo burthensome, still paying, still to ow;\r\nForgetful what from him I still receivd,\r\nAnd understood not that a grateful mind\r\nBy owing owes not, but still pays, at once\r\nIndebted and dischargd; what burden then?\r\nO had his powerful Destiny ordaind\r\nMe some inferiour Angel, I had stood\r\nThen happie; no unbounded hope had rais’d\r\nAmbition.  Yet why not? som other Power\r\nAs great might have aspir’d, and me though mean\r\nDrawn to his part; but other Powers as great\r\nFell not, but stand unshak’n, from within\r\nOr from without, to all temptations arm’d.\r\nHadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?\r\nThou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,\r\nBut Heav’ns free Love dealt equally to all?\r\nBe then his Love accurst, since love or hate,\r\nTo me alike, it deals eternal woe.\r\nNay curs’d be thou; since against his thy will\r\nChose freely what it now so justly rues.\r\nMe miserable! which way shall I flie\r\nInfinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?\r\nWhich way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;\r\nAnd in the lowest deep a lower deep\r\nStill threatning to devour me opens wide,\r\nTo which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav’n.\r\nO then at last relent: is there no place\r\nLeft for Repentance, none for Pardon left?\r\nNone left but by submission; and that word\r\n_Disdain_ forbids me, and my dread of shame\r\nAmong the spirits beneath, whom I seduc’d\r\nWith other promises and other vaunts\r\nThen to submit, boasting I could subdue\r\nTh’ Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know\r\nHow dearly I abide that boast so vaine,\r\nUnder what torments inwardly I groane;\r\nWhile they adore me on the Throne of Hell,\r\nWith Diadem and Scepter high advanc’d\r\nThe lower still I fall, onely Supream\r\nIn miserie; such joy Ambition findes.\r\nBut say I could repent and could obtaine\r\nBy Act of Grace my former state; how soon\r\nWould highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay\r\nWhat feign’d submission swore: ease would recant\r\nVows made in pain, as violent and void.\r\nFor never can true reconcilement grow\r\nWhere wounds of deadly hate have peirc’d so deep:\r\nWhich would but lead me to a worse relapse\r\nAnd heavier fall: so should I purchase deare\r\nShort intermission bought with double smart.\r\nThis knows my punisher; therefore as farr\r\nFrom granting hee, as I from begging peace:\r\nAll hope excluded thus, behold in stead\r\nOf us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,\r\nMankind created, and for him this World.\r\nSo farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,\r\nFarwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;\r\nEvil be thou my Good; by thee at least\r\nDivided Empire with Heav’ns King I hold\r\nBy thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;\r\nAs Man ere long, and this new World shall know.\r\n\r\nThus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face\r\nThrice chang’d with pale, ire, envie and despair,\r\nWhich marrd his borrow’d visage, and betraid\r\nHim counterfet, if any eye beheld.\r\nFor heav’nly mindes from such distempers foule\r\nAre ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware,\r\nEach perturbation smooth’d with outward calme,\r\nArtificer of fraud; and was the first\r\nThat practisd falshood under saintly shew,\r\nDeep malice to conceale, couch’t with revenge:\r\nYet not anough had practisd to deceive\r\n_Uriel_ once warnd; whose eye pursu’d him down\r\nThe way he went, and on th’ _Assyrian_ mount\r\nSaw him disfigur’d, more then could befall\r\nSpirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce\r\nHe markd and mad demeanour, then alone,\r\nAs he suppos’d, all unobserv’d, unseen.\r\nSo on he fares, and to the border comes\r\nOf _Eden_, where delicious Paradise,\r\nNow nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,\r\nAs with a rural mound the champain head\r\nOf a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides\r\nWith thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,\r\nAccess deni’d; and over head up grew\r\nInsuperable highth of loftiest shade,\r\nCedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,\r\nA Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend\r\nShade above shade, a woodie Theatre\r\nOf stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops\r\nThe verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:\r\nWhich to our general Sire gave prospect large\r\nInto his neather Empire neighbouring round.\r\nAnd higher then that Wall a circling row\r\nOf goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,\r\nBlossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue\r\nAppeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:\r\nOn which the Sun more glad impress’d his beams\r\nThen in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,\r\nWhen God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd\r\nThat Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire\r\nMeets his approach, and to the heart inspires\r\nVernal delight and joy, able to drive\r\nAll sadness but despair: now gentle gales\r\nFanning thir odoriferous wings dispense\r\nNative perfumes, and whisper whence they stole\r\nThose balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile\r\nBeyond the _Cape of Hope_, and now are past\r\n_Mozambic_, off at Sea North-East windes blow\r\n_Sabean_ Odours from the spicie shoare\r\nOf _Arabie_ the blest, with such delay\r\nWell pleas’d they slack thir course, and many a League\r\nCheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.\r\nSo entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend\r\nWho came thir bane, though with them better pleas’d\r\nThen _Asmodeus_ with the fishie fume,\r\nThat drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse\r\nOf _Tobits_ Son, and with a vengeance sent\r\nFrom _Media_ post to _Aegypt_, there fast bound.\r\n\r\nNow to th’ ascent of that steep savage Hill\r\n_Satan_ had journied on, pensive and slow;\r\nBut further way found none, so thick entwin’d,\r\nAs one continu’d brake, the undergrowth\r\nOf shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext\r\nAll path of Man or Beast that past that way:\r\nOne Gate there onely was, and that look’d East\r\nOn th’ other side: which when th’ arch-fellon saw\r\nDue entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,\r\nAt one slight bound high overleap’d all bound\r\nOf Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within\r\nLights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe,\r\nWhom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,\r\nWatching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve\r\nIn hurdl’d Cotes amid the field secure,\r\nLeaps o’re the fence with ease into the Fould:\r\nOr as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash\r\nOf some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,\r\nCross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,\r\nIn at the window climbes, or o’re the tiles;\r\nSo clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:\r\nSo since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.\r\nThence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,\r\nThe middle Tree and highest there that grew,\r\nSat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life\r\nThereby regaind, but sat devising Death\r\nTo them who liv’d; nor on the vertue thought\r\nOf that life-giving Plant, but only us’d\r\nFor prospect, what well us’d had bin the pledge\r\nOf immortalitie.  So little knows\r\nAny, but God alone, to value right\r\nThe good before him, but perverts best things\r\nTo worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.\r\nBeneath him with new wonder now he views\r\nTo all delight of human sense expos’d\r\nIn narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,\r\nA Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise\r\nOf God the Garden was, by him in the East\r\nOf _Eden_ planted; _Eden_ stretchd her Line\r\nFrom _Auran_ Eastward to the Royal Towrs\r\nOf great _Seleucia_, built by _Grecian_ Kings,\r\nOr where the Sons of _Eden_ long before\r\nDwelt in _Telassar:_ in this pleasant soile\r\nHis farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;\r\nOut of the fertil ground he caus’d to grow\r\nAll Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;\r\nAnd all amid them stood the Tree of Life,\r\nHigh eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit\r\nOf vegetable Gold; and next to Life\r\nOur Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,\r\nKnowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.\r\nSouthward through _Eden_ went a River large,\r\nNor chang’d his course, but through the shaggie hill\r\nPass’d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown\r\nThat Mountain as his Garden mould high rais’d\r\nUpon the rapid current, which through veins\r\nOf porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,\r\nRose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill\r\nWaterd the Garden; thence united fell\r\nDown the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,\r\nWhich from his darksom passage now appeers,\r\nAnd now divided into four main Streams,\r\nRuns divers, wandring many a famous Realme\r\nAnd Country whereof here needs no account,\r\nBut rather to tell how, if Art could tell,\r\nHow from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,\r\nRowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,\r\nWith mazie error under pendant shades\r\nRan Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed\r\nFlours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art\r\nIn Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon\r\nPowrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,\r\nBoth where the morning Sun first warmly smote\r\nThe open field, and where the unpierc’t shade\r\nImbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,\r\nA happy rural seat of various view;\r\nGroves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,\r\nOthers whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde\r\nHung amiable, _Hesperian_ Fables true,\r\nIf true, here onely, and of delicious taste:\r\nBetwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks\r\nGrasing the tender herb, were interpos’d,\r\nOr palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap\r\nOf som irriguous Valley spread her store,\r\nFlours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:\r\nAnother side, umbrageous Grots and Caves\r\nOf coole recess, o’re which the mantling Vine\r\nLayes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps\r\nLuxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall\r\nDown the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,\r\nThat to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,\r\nHer chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.\r\nThe Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,\r\nBreathing the smell of field and grove, attune\r\nThe trembling leaves, while Universal _Pan_\r\nKnit with the _Graces_ and the _Hours_ in dance\r\nLed on th’ Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field\r\nOf _Enna_, where _Proserpin_ gathring flours\r\nHer self a fairer Floure by gloomie _Dis_\r\nWas gatherd, which cost _Ceres_ all that pain\r\nTo seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove\r\nOf _Daphne_ by _Orontes_, and th’ inspir’d\r\n_Castalian_ Spring might with this Paradise\r\nOf _Eden_ strive; nor that _Nyseian_ Ile\r\nGirt with the River _Triton_, where old _Cham_,\r\nWhom Gentiles _Ammon_ call and _Libyan Jove_,\r\nHid _Amalthea_ and her Florid Son\r\nYoung _Bacchus_ from his Stepdame _Rhea’s_ eye;\r\nNor where _Abassin_ Kings thir issue Guard,\r\nMount _Amara_, though this by som suppos’d\r\nTrue Paradise under the _Ethiop_ Line\r\nBy _Nilus_ head, enclos’d with shining Rock,\r\nA whole dayes journey high, but wide remote\r\nFrom this _Assyrian_ Garden, where the Fiend\r\nSaw undelighted all delight, all kind\r\nOf living Creatures new to sight and strange:\r\nTwo of far nobler shape erect and tall,\r\nGodlike erect, with native Honour clad\r\nIn naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,\r\nAnd worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine\r\nThe image of thir glorious Maker shon,\r\nTruth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,\r\nSevere, but in true filial freedom plac’t;\r\nWhence true autoritie in men; though both\r\nNot equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;\r\nFor contemplation hee and valour formd,\r\nFor softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,\r\nHee for God only, shee for God in him:\r\nHis fair large Front and Eye sublime declar’d\r\nAbsolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks\r\nRound from his parted forelock manly hung\r\nClustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:\r\nShee as a vail down to the slender waste\r\nHer unadorned golden tresses wore\r\nDissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav’d\r\nAs the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli’d\r\nSubjection, but requir’d with gentle sway,\r\nAnd by her yeilded, by him best receivd,\r\nYeilded with coy submission, modest pride,\r\nAnd sweet reluctant amorous delay.\r\nNor those mysterious parts were then conceald,\r\nThen was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame\r\nOf natures works, honor dishonorable,\r\nSin-bred, how have ye troubl’d all mankind\r\nWith shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,\r\nAnd banisht from mans life his happiest life,\r\nSimplicitie and spotless innocence.\r\nSo passd they naked on, nor shund the sight\r\nOf God or Angel, for they thought no ill:\r\nSo hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair\r\nThat ever since in loves imbraces met,\r\n_Adam_ the goodliest man of men since borne\r\nHis Sons, the fairest of her Daughters _Eve_.\r\nUnder a tuft of shade that on a green\r\nStood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side\r\nThey sat them down, and after no more toil\r\nOf thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic’d\r\nTo recommend coole _Zephyr_, and made ease\r\nMore easie, wholsom thirst and appetite\r\nMore grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,\r\nNectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes\r\nYeilded them, side-long as they sat recline\r\nOn the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:\r\nThe savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde\r\nStill as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;\r\nNor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles\r\nWanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems\r\nFair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,\r\nAlone as they.  About them frisking playd\r\nAll Beasts of th’ Earth, since wilde, and of all chase\r\nIn Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;\r\nSporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw\r\nDandl’d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards\r\nGambold before them, th’ unwieldy Elephant\r\nTo make them mirth us’d all his might, & wreathd\r\nHis Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly\r\nInsinuating, wove with Gordian twine\r\nHis breaded train, and of his fatal guile\r\nGave proof unheeded; others on the grass\r\nCoucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,\r\nOr Bedward ruminating: for the Sun\r\nDeclin’d was hasting now with prone carreer\r\nTo th’ Ocean Iles, and in th’ ascending Scale\r\nOf Heav’n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:\r\nWhen _Satan_ still in gaze, as first he stood,\r\nScarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.\r\n\r\nO Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,\r\nInto our room of bliss thus high advanc’t\r\nCreatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,\r\nNot Spirits, yet to heav’nly Spirits bright\r\nLittle inferior; whom my thoughts pursue\r\nWith wonder, and could love, so lively shines\r\nIn them Divine resemblance, and such grace\r\nThe hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.\r\nAh gentle pair, yee little think how nigh\r\nYour change approaches, when all these delights\r\nWill vanish and deliver ye to woe,\r\nMore woe, the more your taste is now of joy;\r\nHappie, but for so happie ill secur’d\r\nLong to continue, and this high seat your Heav’n\r\nIll fenc’t for Heav’n to keep out such a foe\r\nAs now is enterd; yet no purpos’d foe\r\nTo you whom I could pittie thus forlorne\r\nThough I unpittied: League with you I seek,\r\nAnd mutual amitie so streight, so close,\r\nThat I with you must dwell, or you with me\r\nHenceforth; my dwelling haply may not please\r\nLike this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such\r\nAccept your Makers work; he gave it me,\r\nWhich I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,\r\nTo entertain you two, her widest Gates,\r\nAnd send forth all her Kings; there will be room,\r\nNot like these narrow limits, to receive\r\nYour numerous ofspring; if no better place,\r\nThank him who puts me loath to this revenge\r\nOn you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.\r\nAnd should I at your harmless innocence\r\nMelt, as I doe, yet public reason just,\r\nHonour and Empire with revenge enlarg’d,\r\nBy conquering this new World, compels me now\r\nTo do what else though damnd I should abhorre.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,\r\nThe Tyrants plea, excus’d his devilish deeds.\r\nThen from his loftie stand on that high Tree\r\nDown he alights among the sportful Herd\r\nOf those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,\r\nNow other, as thir shape servd best his end\r\nNeerer to view his prey, and unespi’d\r\nTo mark what of thir state he more might learn\r\nBy word or action markt: about them round\r\nA Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,\r\nThen as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi’d\r\nIn some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,\r\nStrait couches close, then rising changes oft\r\nHis couchant watch, as one who chose his ground\r\nWhence rushing he might surest seise them both\r\nGrip’t in each paw: when _Adam_ first of men\r\nTo first of women _Eve_ thus moving speech,\r\nTurnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.\r\n\r\nSole partner and sole part of all these joyes,\r\nDearer thy self then all; needs must the Power\r\nThat made us, and for us this ample World\r\nBe infinitly good, and of his good\r\nAs liberal and free as infinite,\r\nThat rais’d us from the dust and plac’t us here\r\nIn all this happiness, who at his hand\r\nHave nothing merited, nor can performe\r\nAught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires\r\nFrom us no other service then to keep\r\nThis one, this easie charge, of all the Trees\r\nIn Paradise that beare delicious fruit\r\nSo various, not to taste that onely Tree\r\nOf knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,\r\nSo neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,\r\nSom dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst\r\nGod hath pronounc’t it death to taste that Tree,\r\nThe only sign of our obedience left\r\nAmong so many signes of power and rule\r\nConferrd upon us, and Dominion giv’n\r\nOver all other Creatures that possesse\r\nEarth, Aire, and Sea.  Then let us not think hard\r\nOne easie prohibition, who enjoy\r\nFree leave so large to all things else, and choice\r\nUnlimited of manifold delights:\r\nBut let us ever praise him, and extoll\r\nHis bountie, following our delightful task\r\nTo prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours,\r\nWhich were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus Eve repli’d.  O thou for whom\r\nAnd from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,\r\nAnd without whom am to no end, my Guide\r\nAnd Head, what thou hast said is just and right.\r\nFor wee to him indeed all praises owe,\r\nAnd daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy\r\nSo farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee\r\nPreeminent by so much odds, while thou\r\nLike consort to thy self canst no where find.\r\nThat day I oft remember, when from sleep\r\nI first awak’t, and found my self repos’d\r\nUnder a shade on flours, much wondring where\r\nAnd what I was, whence thither brought, and how.\r\nNot distant far from thence a murmuring sound\r\nOf waters issu’d from a Cave and spread\r\nInto a liquid Plain, then stood unmov’d\r\nPure as th’ expanse of Heav’n; I thither went\r\nWith unexperienc’t thought, and laid me downe\r\nOn the green bank, to look into the cleer\r\nSmooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.\r\nAs I bent down to look, just opposite,\r\nA Shape within the watry gleam appeerd\r\nBending to look on me, I started back,\r\nIt started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,\r\nPleas’d it returnd as soon with answering looks\r\nOf sympathie and love, there I had fixt\r\nMine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desire,\r\nHad not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,\r\nWhat there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,\r\nWith thee it came and goes: but follow me,\r\nAnd I will bring thee where no shadow staies\r\nThy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee\r\nWhose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy\r\nInseparablie thine, to him shalt beare\r\nMultitudes like thy self, and thence be call’d\r\nMother of human Race: what could I doe,\r\nBut follow strait, invisibly thus led?\r\nTill I espi’d thee, fair indeed and tall,\r\nUnder a Platan, yet methought less faire,\r\nLess winning soft, less amiablie milde,\r\nThen that smooth watry image; back I turnd,\r\nThou following cryd’st aloud, Return fair _Eve_,\r\nWhom fli’st thou? whom thou fli’st, of him thou art,\r\nHis flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent\r\nOut of my side to thee, neerest my heart\r\nSubstantial Life, to have thee by my side\r\nHenceforth an individual solace dear;\r\nPart of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim\r\nMy other half: with that thy gentle hand\r\nSeisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see\r\nHow beauty is excelld by manly grace\r\nAnd wisdom, which alone is truly fair.\r\n\r\nSo spake our general Mother, and with eyes\r\nOf conjugal attraction unreprov’d,\r\nAnd meek surrender, half imbracing leand\r\nOn our first Father, half her swelling Breast\r\nNaked met his under the flowing Gold\r\nOf her loose tresses hid: he in delight\r\nBoth of her Beauty and submissive Charms\r\nSmil’d with superior Love, as _Jupiter_\r\nOn _Juno_ smiles, when he impregns the Clouds\r\nThat shed _May_ Flowers; and press’d her Matron lip\r\nWith kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd\r\nFor envie, yet with jealous leer maligne\r\nEy’d them askance, and to himself thus plaind.\r\n\r\nSight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two\r\nImparadis’t in one anothers arms\r\nThe happier _Eden_, shall enjoy thir fill\r\nOf bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,\r\nWhere neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,\r\nAmong our other torments not the least,\r\nStill unfulfill’d with pain of longing pines;\r\nYet let me not forget what I have gain’d\r\nFrom thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:\r\nOne fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call’d,\r\nForbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd’n?\r\nSuspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord\r\nEnvie them that? can it be sin to know,\r\nCan it be death? and do they onely stand\r\nBy Ignorance, is that thir happie state,\r\nThe proof of thir obedience and thir faith?\r\nO fair foundation laid whereon to build\r\nThir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds\r\nWith more desire to know, and to reject\r\nEnvious commands, invented with designe\r\nTo keep them low whom knowledge might exalt\r\nEqual with Gods; aspiring to be such,\r\nThey taste and die: what likelier can ensue?\r\nBut first with narrow search I must walk round\r\nThis Garden, and no corner leave unspi’d;\r\nA chance but chance may lead where I may meet\r\nSome wandring Spirit of Heav’n, by Fountain side,\r\nOr in thick shade retir’d, from him to draw\r\nWhat further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,\r\nYet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,\r\nShort pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.\r\n\r\nSo saying, his proud step he scornful turn’d,\r\nBut with sly circumspection, and began\r\nThrough wood, through waste, o’re hil, o’re dale his roam.\r\nMean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav’n\r\nWith Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun\r\nSlowly descended, and with right aspect\r\nAgainst the eastern Gate of Paradise\r\nLeveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock\r\nOf Alablaster, pil’d up to the Clouds,\r\nConspicuous farr, winding with one ascent\r\nAccessible from Earth, one entrance high;\r\nThe rest was craggie cliff, that overhung\r\nStill as it rose, impossible to climbe.\r\nBetwixt these rockie Pillars _Gabriel_ sat\r\nChief of th’ Angelic Guards, awaiting night;\r\nAbout him exercis’d Heroic Games\r\nTh’ unarmed Youth of Heav’n, but nigh at hand\r\nCelestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares\r\nHung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.\r\nThither came _Uriel_, gliding through the Eeven\r\nOn a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr\r\nIn _Autumn_ thwarts the night, when vapors fir’d\r\nImpress the Air, and shews the Mariner\r\nFrom what point of his Compass to beware\r\nImpetuous winds: he thus began in haste.\r\n\r\n_Gabriel_, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv’n\r\nCharge and strict watch that to this happie place\r\nNo evil thing approach or enter in;\r\nThis day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare\r\nA Spirit, zealous, as he seem’d, to know\r\nMore of th’ Almighties works, and chiefly Man\r\nGods latest Image: I describ’d his way\r\nBent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;\r\nBut in the Mount that lies from _Eden_ North,\r\nWhere he first lighted, soon discernd his looks\r\nAlien from Heav’n, with passions foul obscur’d:\r\nMine eye pursu’d him still, but under shade\r\nLost sight of him; one of the banisht crew\r\nI fear, hath ventur’d from the deep, to raise\r\nNew troubles; him thy care must be to find.\r\n\r\nTo whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:\r\n_Uriel_, no wonder if thy perfet sight,\r\nAmid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,\r\nSee farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass\r\nThe vigilance here plac’t, but such as come\r\nWell known from Heav’n; and since Meridian hour\r\nNo Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,\r\nSo minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds\r\nOn purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude\r\nSpiritual substance with corporeal barr.\r\nBut if within the circuit of these walks\r\nIn whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom\r\nThou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.\r\n\r\nSo promis’d hee, and _Uriel_ to his charge\r\nReturnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd\r\nBore him slope downward to the Sun now fall’n\r\nBeneath th’ _Azores_; whither the prime Orb,\r\nIncredible how swift, had thither rowl’d\r\nDiurnal, or this less volubil Earth\r\nBy shorter flight to th’ East, had left him there\r\nArraying with reflected Purple and Gold\r\nThe Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:\r\nNow came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray\r\nHad in her sober Liverie all things clad;\r\nSilence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,\r\nThey to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests\r\nWere slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;\r\nShe all night long her amorous descant sung;\r\nSilence was pleas’d: now glow’d the Firmament\r\nWith living Saphirs: _Hesperus_ that led\r\nThe starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon\r\nRising in clouded Majestie, at length\r\nApparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,\r\nAnd o’re the dark her Silver Mantle threw.\r\n\r\nWhen _Adam_ thus to _Eve_: Fair Consort, th’ hour\r\nOf night, and all things now retir’d to rest\r\nMind us of like repose, since God hath set\r\nLabour and rest, as day and night to men\r\nSuccessive, and the timely dew of sleep\r\nNow falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines\r\nOur eye-lids; other Creatures all day long\r\nRove idle unimploid, and less need rest;\r\nMan hath his daily work of body or mind\r\nAppointed, which declares his Dignitie,\r\nAnd the regard of Heav’n on all his waies;\r\nWhile other Animals unactive range,\r\nAnd of thir doings God takes no account.\r\nTomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East\r\nWith first approach of light, we must be ris’n,\r\nAnd at our pleasant labour, to reform\r\nYon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,\r\nOur walks at noon, with branches overgrown,\r\nThat mock our scant manuring, and require\r\nMore hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:\r\nThose Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,\r\nThat lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,\r\nAsk riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;\r\nMean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Eve_ with perfet beauty adornd.\r\nMy Author and Disposer, what thou bidst\r\nUnargu’d I obey; so God ordains,\r\nGod is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more\r\nIs womans happiest knowledge and her praise.\r\nWith thee conversing I forget all time,\r\nAll seasons and thir change, all please alike.\r\nSweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,\r\nWith charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun\r\nWhen first on this delightful Land he spreads\r\nHis orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,\r\nGlistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth\r\nAfter soft showers; and sweet the coming on\r\nOf grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night\r\nWith this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,\r\nAnd these the Gemms of Heav’n, her starrie train:\r\nBut neither breath of Morn when she ascends\r\nWith charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun\r\nOn this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,\r\nGlistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,\r\nNor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night\r\nWith this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,\r\nOr glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.\r\nBut wherfore all night long shine these, for whom\r\nThis glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?\r\n\r\nTo whom our general Ancestor repli’d.\r\nDaughter of God and Man, accomplisht _Eve_,\r\nThose have thir course to finish, round the Earth,\r\nBy morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land\r\nIn order, though to Nations yet unborn,\r\nMinistring light prepar’d, they set and rise;\r\nLeast total darkness should by Night regaine\r\nHer old possession, and extinguish life\r\nIn Nature and all things, which these soft fires\r\nNot only enlighten, but with kindly heate\r\nOf various influence foment and warme,\r\nTemper or nourish, or in part shed down\r\nThir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow\r\nOn Earth, made hereby apter to receive\r\nPerfection from the Suns more potent Ray.\r\nThese then, though unbeheld in deep of night,\r\nShine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,\r\nThat heav’n would want spectators, God want praise;\r\nMillions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth\r\nUnseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:\r\nAll these with ceasless praise his works behold\r\nBoth day and night: how often from the steep\r\nOf echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard\r\nCelestial voices to the midnight air,\r\nSole, or responsive each to others note\r\nSinging thir great Creator: oft in bands\r\nWhile they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk\r\nWith Heav’nly touch of instrumental sounds\r\nIn full harmonic number joind, thir songs\r\nDivide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThus talking hand in hand alone they pass’d\r\nOn to thir blissful Bower; it was a place\r\nChos’n by the sovran Planter, when he fram’d\r\nAll things to mans delightful use; the roofe\r\nOf thickest covert was inwoven shade\r\nLaurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew\r\nOf firm and fragrant leaf; on either side\r\n_Acanthus_, and each odorous bushie shrub\r\nFenc’d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,\r\n_Iris_ all hues, Roses, and Gessamin\r\nRear’d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought\r\nMosaic; underfoot the Violet,\r\nCrocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay\r\nBroiderd the ground, more colour’d then with stone\r\nOf costliest Emblem: other Creature here\r\nBeast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;\r\nSuch was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower\r\nMore sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,\r\n_Pan_ or _Silvanus_ never slept, nor Nymph,\r\nNor _Faunus_ haunted.  Here in close recess\r\nWith Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs\r\nEspoused _Eve_ deckt first her Nuptial Bed,\r\nAnd heav’nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,\r\nWhat day the genial Angel to our Sire\r\nBrought her in naked beauty more adorn’d,\r\nMore lovely then _Pandora_, whom the Gods\r\nEndowd with all thir gifts, and O too like\r\nIn sad event, when to the unwiser Son\r\nOf _Japhet_ brought by _Hermes_, she ensnar’d\r\nMankind with her faire looks, to be aveng’d\r\nOn him who had stole _Joves_ authentic fire.\r\n\r\nThus at thir shadie Lodge arriv’d, both stood,\r\nBoth turnd, and under op’n Skie ador’d\r\nThe God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav’n\r\nWhich they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe\r\nAnd starrie Pole: Thou also mad’st the Night,\r\nMaker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,\r\nWhich we in our appointed work imployd\r\nHave finisht happie in our mutual help\r\nAnd mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss\r\nOrdain’d by thee, and this delicious place\r\nFor us too large, where thy abundance wants\r\nPartakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.\r\nBut thou hast promis’d from us two a Race\r\nTo fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll\r\nThy goodness infinite, both when we wake,\r\nAnd when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.\r\n\r\nThis said unanimous, and other Rites\r\nObserving none, but adoration pure\r\nWhich God likes best, into thir inmost bower\r\nHanded they went; and eas’d the putting off\r\nThese troublesom disguises which wee wear,\r\nStrait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene\r\n_Adam_ from his fair Spouse, nor _Eve_ the Rites\r\nMysterious of connubial Love refus’d:\r\nWhatever Hypocrites austerely talk\r\nOf puritie and place and innocence,\r\nDefaming as impure what God declares\r\nPure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.\r\nOur Maker bids increase, who bids abstain\r\nBut our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?\r\nHaile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source\r\nOf human ofspring, sole proprietie,\r\nIn Paradise of all things common else.\r\nBy thee adulterous lust was driv’n from men\r\nAmong the bestial herds to raunge, by thee\r\nFounded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,\r\nRelations dear, and all the Charities\r\nOf Father, Son, and Brother first were known.\r\nFarr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,\r\nOr think thee unbefitting holiest place,\r\nPerpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,\r\nWhose Bed is undefil’d and chast pronounc’t,\r\nPresent, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us’d.\r\nHere Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights\r\nHis constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,\r\nReigns here and revels; not in the bought smile\r\nOf Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,\r\nCasual fruition, nor in Court Amours\r\nMixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,\r\nOr Serenate, which the starv’d Lover sings\r\nTo his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.\r\nThese lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,\r\nAnd on thir naked limbs the flourie roof\r\nShowrd Roses, which the Morn repair’d.  Sleep on,\r\nBlest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek\r\nNo happier state, and know to know no more.\r\n\r\nNow had night measur’d with her shaddowie Cone\r\nHalf way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,\r\nAnd from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim\r\nForth issuing at th’ accustomd hour stood armd\r\nTo thir night watches in warlike Parade,\r\nWhen _Gabriel_ to his next in power thus spake.\r\n\r\n_Uzziel_, half these draw off, and coast the South\r\nWith strictest watch; these other wheel the North,\r\nOur circuit meets full West.  As flame they part\r\nHalf wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.\r\nFrom these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld\r\nThat neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.\r\n\r\n_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_, with wingd speed\r\nSearch through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook,\r\nBut chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,\r\nNow laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.\r\nThis Eevning from the Sun’s decline arriv’d\r\nWho tells of som infernal Spirit seen\r\nHitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap’d\r\nThe barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:\r\nSuch where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.\r\n\r\nSo saying, on he led his radiant Files,\r\nDaz’ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct\r\nIn search of whom they sought: him there they found\r\nSquat like a Toad, close at the eare of _Eve_;\r\nAssaying by his Devilish art to reach\r\nThe Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge\r\nIllusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,\r\nOr if, inspiring venom, he might taint\r\nTh’ animal Spirits that from pure blood arise\r\nLike gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise\r\nAt least distemperd, discontented thoughts,\r\nVain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires\r\nBlown up with high conceits ingendring pride.\r\nHim thus intent _Ithuriel_ with his Spear\r\nTouch’d lightly; for no falshood can endure\r\nTouch of Celestial temper, but returns\r\nOf force to its own likeness: up he starts\r\nDiscoverd and surpriz’d.  As when a spark\r\nLights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid\r\nFit for the Tun som Magazin to store\r\nAgainst a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine\r\nWith sudden blaze diffus’d, inflames the Aire:\r\nSo started up in his own shape the Fiend.\r\nBack stept those two fair Angels half amaz’d\r\nSo sudden to behold the grieslie King;\r\nYet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.\r\n\r\nWhich of those rebell Spirits adjudg’d to Hell\r\nCom’st thou, escap’d thy prison, and transform’d,\r\nWhy satst thou like an enemie in waite\r\nHere watching at the head of these that sleep?\r\n\r\nKnow ye not then said _Satan_, filld with scorn,\r\nKnow ye not me? ye knew me once no mate\r\nFor you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;\r\nNot to know mee argues your selves unknown,\r\nThe lowest of your throng; or if ye know,\r\nWhy ask ye, and superfluous begin\r\nYour message, like to end as much in vain?\r\nTo whom thus _Zephon_, answering scorn with scorn.\r\nThink not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,\r\nOr undiminisht brightness, to be known\r\nAs when thou stoodst in Heav’n upright and pure;\r\nThat Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,\r\nDeparted from thee, and thou resembl’st now\r\nThy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.\r\nBut come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account\r\nTo him who sent us, whose charge is to keep\r\nThis place inviolable, and these from harm.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke\r\nSevere in youthful beautie, added grace\r\nInvincible: abasht the Devil stood,\r\nAnd felt how awful goodness is, and saw\r\nVertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin’d\r\nHis loss; but chiefly to find here observd\r\nHis lustre visibly impar’d; yet seemd\r\nUndaunted.  If I must contend, said he,\r\nBest with the best, the Sender not the sent,\r\nOr all at once; more glorie will be wonn,\r\nOr less be lost.  Thy fear, said _Zephon_ bold,\r\nWill save us trial what the least can doe\r\nSingle against thee wicked, and thence weak.\r\n\r\nThe Fiend repli’d not, overcome with rage;\r\nBut like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,\r\nChaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie\r\nHe held it vain; awe from above had quelld\r\nHis heart, not else dismai’d.  Now drew they nigh\r\nThe western point, where those half-rounding guards\r\nJust met, & closing stood in squadron joind\r\nAwaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief\r\n_Gabriel_ from the Front thus calld aloud.\r\n\r\nO friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet\r\nHasting this way, and now by glimps discerne\r\n_Ithuriel_ and _Zephon_ through the shade,\r\nAnd with them comes a third of Regal port,\r\nBut faded splendor wan; who by his gate\r\nAnd fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,\r\nNot likely to part hence without contest;\r\nStand firm, for in his look defiance lours.\r\n\r\nHe scarce had ended, when those two approachd\r\nAnd brief related whom they brought, wher found,\r\nHow busied, in what form and posture coucht.\r\n\r\nTo whom with stern regard thus _Gabriel_ spake.\r\nWhy hast thou, _Satan_, broke the bounds prescrib’d\r\nTo thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge\r\nOf others, who approve not to transgress\r\nBy thy example, but have power and right\r\nTo question thy bold entrance on this place;\r\nImploi’d it seems to violate sleep, and those\r\nWhose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Satan_ with contemptuous brow.\r\n_Gabriel_, thou hadst in Heav’n th’ esteem of wise,\r\nAnd such I held thee; but this question askt\r\nPuts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?\r\nWho would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,\r\nThough thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,\r\nAnd boldly venture to whatever place\r\nFarthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change\r\nTorment with ease, & soonest recompence\r\nDole with delight, which in this place I sought;\r\nTo thee no reason; who knowst only good,\r\nBut evil hast not tri’d: and wilt object\r\nHis will who bound us? let him surer barr\r\nHis Iron Gates, if he intends our stay\r\nIn that dark durance: thus much what was askt.\r\nThe rest is true, they found me where they say;\r\nBut that implies not violence or harme.\r\n\r\nThus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov’d,\r\nDisdainfully half smiling thus repli’d.\r\nO loss of one in Heav’n to judge of wise,\r\nSince _Satan_ fell, whom follie overthrew,\r\nAnd now returns him from his prison scap’t,\r\nGravely in doubt whether to hold them wise\r\nOr not, who ask what boldness brought him hither\r\nUnlicenc’t from his bounds in Hell prescrib’d;\r\nSo wise he judges it to fly from pain\r\nHowever, and to scape his punishment.\r\nSo judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,\r\nWhich thou incurr’st by flying, meet thy flight\r\nSeavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,\r\nWhich taught thee yet no better, that no pain\r\nCan equal anger infinite provok’t.\r\nBut wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee\r\nCame not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them\r\nLess pain, less to be fled, or thou then they\r\nLess hardie to endure? courageous Chief,\r\nThe first in flight from pain, had’st thou alleg’d\r\nTo thy deserted host this cause of flight,\r\nThou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.\r\n\r\nTo which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.\r\nNot that I less endure, or shrink from pain,\r\nInsulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood\r\nThy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide\r\nThe blasting volied Thunder made all speed\r\nAnd seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.\r\nBut still thy words at random, as before,\r\nArgue thy inexperience what behooves\r\nFrom hard assaies and ill successes past\r\nA faithful Leader, not to hazard all\r\nThrough wayes of danger by himself untri’d.\r\nI therefore, I alone first undertook\r\nTo wing the desolate Abyss, and spie\r\nThis new created World, whereof in Hell\r\nFame is not silent, here in hope to find\r\nBetter abode, and my afflicted Powers\r\nTo settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;\r\nThough for possession put to try once more\r\nWhat thou and thy gay Legions dare against;\r\nWhose easier business were to serve thir Lord\r\nHigh up in Heav’n, with songs to hymne his Throne,\r\nAnd practis’d distances to cringe, not fight.\r\n\r\nTo whom the warriour Angel soon repli’d.\r\nTo say and strait unsay, pretending first\r\nWise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,\r\nArgues no Leader, but a lyar trac’t,\r\n_Satan_, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,\r\nO sacred name of faithfulness profan’d!\r\nFaithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?\r\nArmie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;\r\nWas this your discipline and faith ingag’d,\r\nYour military obedience, to dissolve\r\nAllegeance to th’ acknowledg’d Power supream?\r\nAnd thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem\r\nPatron of liberty, who more then thou\r\nOnce fawn’d, and cring’d, and servilly ador’d\r\nHeav’ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope\r\nTo dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?\r\nBut mark what I arreede thee now, avant;\r\nFlie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre\r\nWithin these hallowd limits thou appeer,\r\nBack to th’ infernal pit I drag thee chaind,\r\nAnd Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne\r\nThe facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.\r\n\r\nSo threatn’d hee, but _Satan_ to no threats\r\nGave heed, but waxing more in rage repli’d.\r\n\r\nThen when I am thy captive talk of chaines,\r\nProud limitarie Cherube, but ere then\r\nFarr heavier load thy self expect to feel\r\nFrom my prevailing arme, though Heavens King\r\nRide on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,\r\nUs’d to the yoak, draw’st his triumphant wheels\r\nIn progress through the rode of Heav’n Star-pav’d.\r\n\r\nWhile thus he spake, th’ Angelic Squadron bright\r\nTurnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes\r\nThir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round\r\nWith ported Spears, as thick as when a field\r\nOf _Ceres_ ripe for harvest waving bends\r\nHer bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind\r\nSwayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands\r\nLeast on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves\r\nProve chaff.  On th’ other side _Satan_ allarm’d\r\nCollecting all his might dilated stood,\r\nLike _Teneriff_ or _Atlas_ unremov’d:\r\nHis stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest\r\nSat horror Plum’d; nor wanted in his graspe\r\nWhat seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds\r\nMight have ensu’d, nor onely Paradise\r\nIn this commotion, but the Starrie Cope\r\nOf Heav’n perhaps, or all the Elements\r\nAt least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne\r\nWith violence of this conflict, had not soon\r\nTh’ Eternal to prevent such horrid fray\r\nHung forth in Heav’n his golden Scales, yet seen\r\nBetwixt _Astrea_ and the _Scorpion_ signe,\r\nWherein all things created first he weighd,\r\nThe pendulous round Earth with ballanc’t Aire\r\nIn counterpoise, now ponders all events,\r\nBattels and Realms: in these he put two weights\r\nThe sequel each of parting and of fight;\r\nThe latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;\r\nWhich _Gabriel_ spying, thus bespake the Fiend.\r\n\r\n_Satan_, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,\r\nNeither our own but giv’n; what follie then\r\nTo boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more\r\nThen Heav’n permits, nor mine, though doubld now\r\nTo trample thee as mire: for proof look up,\r\nAnd read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign\r\nWhere thou art weigh’d, & shown how light, how weak,\r\nIf thou resist.  The Fiend lookt up and knew\r\nHis mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled\r\nMurmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK V.\r\n\r\nNow Morn her rosie steps in th’ Eastern Clime\r\nAdvancing, sow’d the Earth with Orient Pearle,\r\nWhen _Adam_ wak’t, so customd, for his sleep\r\nWas Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,\r\nAnd temperat vapors bland, which th’ only sound\r\nOf leaves and fuming rills, _Aurora’s_ fan,\r\nLightly dispers’d, and the shrill Matin Song\r\nOf Birds on every bough; so much the more\r\nHis wonder was to find unwak’nd _Eve_\r\nWith Tresses discompos’d, and glowing Cheek,\r\nAs through unquiet rest: he on his side\r\nLeaning half-rais’d, with looks of cordial Love\r\nHung over her enamour’d, and beheld\r\nBeautie, which whether waking or asleep,\r\nShot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice\r\nMilde, as when _Zephyrus_ on _Flora_ breathes,\r\nHer hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake\r\nMy fairest, my espous’d, my latest found,\r\nHeav’ns last best gift, my ever new delight,\r\nAwake, the morning shines, and the fresh field\r\nCalls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring\r\nOur tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,\r\nWhat drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed,\r\nHow Nature paints her colours, how the Bee\r\nSits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.\r\n\r\nSuch whispering wak’d her, but with startl’d eye\r\nOn _Adam_, whom imbracing, thus she spake.\r\n\r\nO Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,\r\nMy Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see\r\nThy face, and Morn return’d, for I this Night,\r\nSuch night till this I never pass’d, have dream’d,\r\nIf dream’d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,\r\nWorks of day pass’t, or morrows next designe,\r\nBut of offence and trouble, which my mind\r\nKnew never till this irksom night; methought\r\nClose at mine ear one call’d me forth to walk\r\nWith gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,\r\nWhy sleepst thou _Eve_? now is the pleasant time,\r\nThe cool, the silent, save where silence yields\r\nTo the night-warbling Bird, that now awake\r\nTunes sweetest his love-labor’d song; now reignes\r\nFull Orb’d the Moon, and with more pleasing light\r\nShadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,\r\nIf none regard; Heav’n wakes with all his eyes,\r\nWhom to behold but thee, Natures desire,\r\nIn whose sight all things joy, with ravishment\r\nAttracted by thy beauty still to gaze.\r\nI rose as at thy call, but found thee not;\r\nTo find thee I directed then my walk;\r\nAnd on, methought, alone I pass’d through ways\r\nThat brought me on a sudden to the Tree\r\nOf interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem’d,\r\nMuch fairer to my Fancie then by day:\r\nAnd as I wondring lookt, beside it stood\r\nOne shap’d & wing’d like one of those from Heav’n\r\nBy us oft seen; his dewie locks distill’d\r\nAmbrosia; on that Tree he also gaz’d;\r\nAnd O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg’d,\r\nDeigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,\r\nNor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis’d?\r\nOr envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?\r\nForbid who will, none shall from me withhold\r\nLonger thy offerd good, why else set here?\r\nThis said he paus’d not, but with ventrous Arme\r\nHe pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil’d\r\nAt such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:\r\nBut he thus overjoy’d, O Fruit Divine,\r\nSweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,\r\nForbidd’n here, it seems, as onely fit\r\nFor Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:\r\nAnd why not Gods of Men, since good, the more\r\nCommunicated, more abundant growes,\r\nThe Author not impair’d, but honourd more?\r\nHere, happie Creature, fair Angelic _Eve_,\r\nPartake thou also; happie though thou art,\r\nHappier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:\r\nTaste this, and be henceforth among the Gods\r\nThy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,\r\nBut somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes\r\nAscend to Heav’n, by merit thine, and see\r\nWhat life the Gods live there, and such live thou.\r\nSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,\r\nEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part\r\nWhich he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell\r\nSo quick’nd appetite, that I, methought,\r\nCould not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds\r\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\r\nThe Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide\r\nAnd various: wondring at my flight and change\r\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\r\nMy Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,\r\nAnd fell asleep; but O how glad I wak’d\r\nTo find this but a dream!  Thus _Eve_ her Night\r\nRelated, and thus _Adam_ answerd sad.\r\n\r\nBest Image of my self and dearer half,\r\nThe trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep\r\nAffects me equally; nor can I like\r\nThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;\r\nYet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,\r\nCreated pure.  But know that in the Soule\r\nAre many lesser Faculties that serve\r\nReason as chief; among these Fansie next\r\nHer office holds; of all external things,\r\nWhich the five watchful Senses represent,\r\nShe forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,\r\nWhich Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames\r\nAll what we affirm or what deny, and call\r\nOur knowledge or opinion; then retires\r\nInto her private Cell when Nature rests.\r\nOft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes\r\nTo imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,\r\nWilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,\r\nIll matching words and deeds long past or late.\r\nSom such resemblances methinks I find\r\nOf our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,\r\nBut with addition strange; yet be not sad.\r\nEvil into the mind of God or Man\r\nMay come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave\r\nNo spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope\r\nThat what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,\r\nWaking thou never wilt consent to do.\r\nBe not disheart’nd then, nor cloud those looks\r\nThat wont to be more chearful and serene\r\nThen when fair Morning first smiles on the World,\r\nAnd let us to our fresh imployments rise\r\nAmong the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours\r\nThat open now thir choicest bosom’d smells\r\nReservd from night, and kept for thee in store.\r\n\r\nSo cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,\r\nBut silently a gentle tear let fall\r\nFrom either eye, and wip’d them with her haire;\r\nTwo other precious drops that ready stood,\r\nEach in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell\r\nKiss’d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse\r\nAnd pious awe, that feard to have offended.\r\n\r\nSo all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.\r\nBut first from under shadie arborous roof,\r\nSoon as they forth were come to open sight\r\nOf day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen\r\nWith wheels yet hov’ring o’re the Ocean brim,\r\nShot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,\r\nDiscovering in wide Lantskip all the East\r\nOf Paradise and _Edens_ happie Plains,\r\nLowly they bow’d adoring, and began\r\nThir Orisons, each Morning duly paid\r\nIn various style, for neither various style\r\nNor holy rapture wanted they to praise\r\nThir Maker, in fit strains pronounc’t or sung\r\nUnmeditated, such prompt eloquence\r\nFlowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,\r\nMore tuneable then needed Lute or Harp\r\nTo add more sweetness, and they thus began.\r\n\r\nThese are thy glorious works, Parent of good,\r\nAlmightie, thine this universal Frame,\r\nThus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!\r\nUnspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens\r\nTo us invisible or dimly seen\r\nIn these thy lowest works, yet these declare\r\nThy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:\r\nSpeak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,\r\nAngels, for yee behold him, and with songs\r\nAnd choral symphonies, Day without Night,\r\nCircle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav’n,\r\nOn Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll\r\nHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.\r\nFairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,\r\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn,\r\nSure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn\r\nWith thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare\r\nWhile day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.\r\nThou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,\r\nAcknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise\r\nIn thy eternal course, both when thou climb’st,\r\nAnd when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst.\r\nMoon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli’st\r\nWith the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,\r\nAnd yee five other wandring Fires that move\r\nIn mystic Dance not without Song, resound\r\nHis praise, who out of Darkness call’d up Light.\r\nAire, and ye Elements the eldest birth\r\nOf Natures Womb, that in quaternion run\r\nPerpetual Circle, multiform; and mix\r\nAnd nourish all things, let your ceasless change\r\nVarie to our great Maker still new praise.\r\nYe Mists and Exhalations that now rise\r\nFrom Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,\r\nTill the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,\r\nIn honour to the Worlds great Author rise,\r\nWhether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,\r\nOr wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,\r\nRising or falling still advance his praise.\r\nHis praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,\r\nBreath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,\r\nWith every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.\r\nFountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,\r\nMelodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.\r\nJoyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,\r\nThat singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,\r\nBear on your wings and in your notes his praise;\r\nYee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk\r\nThe Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;\r\nWitness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,\r\nTo Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade\r\nMade vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.\r\nHail universal Lord, be bounteous still\r\nTo give us onely good; and if the night\r\nHave gathered aught of evil or conceald,\r\nDisperse it, as now light dispels the dark.\r\n\r\nSo pray’d they innocent, and to thir thoughts\r\nFirm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.\r\nOn to thir mornings rural work they haste\r\nAmong sweet dewes and flours; where any row\r\nOf Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr\r\nThir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check\r\nFruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine\r\nTo wed her Elm; she spous’d about him twines\r\nHer mariageable arms, and with her brings\r\nHer dowr th’ adopted Clusters, to adorn\r\nHis barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld\r\nWith pittie Heav’ns high King, and to him call’d\r\n_Raphael_, the sociable Spirit, that deign’d\r\nTo travel with _Tobias_, and secur’d\r\nHis marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.\r\n\r\n_Raphael_, said hee, thou hear’st what stir on Earth\r\n_Satan_ from Hell scap’t through the darksom Gulf\r\nHath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd\r\nThis night the human pair, how he designes\r\nIn them at once to ruin all mankind.\r\nGo therefore, half this day as friend with friend\r\nConverse with _Adam_, in what Bowre or shade\r\nThou find’st him from the heat of Noon retir’d,\r\nTo respit his day-labour with repast,\r\nOr with repose; and such discourse bring on,\r\nAs may advise him of his happie state,\r\nHappiness in his power left free to will,\r\nLeft to his own free Will, his Will though free,\r\nYet mutable; whence warne him to beware\r\nHe swerve not too secure: tell him withall\r\nHis danger, and from whom, what enemie\r\nLate falln himself from Heav’n, is plotting now\r\nThe fall of others from like state of bliss;\r\nBy violence, no, for that shall be withstood,\r\nBut by deceit and lies; this let him know,\r\nLeast wilfully transgressing he pretend\r\nSurprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.\r\n\r\nSo spake th’ Eternal Father, and fulfilld\r\nAll Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint\r\nAfter his charge receivd, but from among\r\nThousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood\r\nVaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light\r\nFlew through the midst of Heav’n; th’ angelic Quires\r\nOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way\r\nThrough all th’ Empyreal road; till at the Gate\r\nOf Heav’n arriv’d, the gate self-opend wide\r\nOn golden Hinges turning, as by work\r\nDivine the sov’ran Architect had fram’d.\r\nFrom hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,\r\nStarr interpos’d, however small he sees,\r\nNot unconform to other shining Globes,\r\nEarth and the Gard’n of God, with Cedars crownd\r\nAbove all Hills.  As when by night the Glass\r\nOf _Galileo_, less assur’d, observes\r\nImagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:\r\nOr Pilot from amidst the _Cyclades_\r\n_Delos_ or _Samos_ first appeering kenns\r\nA cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight\r\nHe speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie\r\nSailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing\r\nNow on the polar windes, then with quick Fann\r\nWinnows the buxom Air; till within soare\r\nOf Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems\r\nA _Phoenix_, gaz’d by all, as that sole Bird\r\nWhen to enshrine his reliques in the Sun’s\r\nBright Temple, to _Aegyptian Theb’s_ he flies.\r\nAt once on th’ Eastern cliff of Paradise\r\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\r\nA Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade\r\nHis lineaments Divine; the pair that clad\r\nEach shoulder broad, came mantling o’re his brest\r\nWith regal Ornament; the middle pair\r\nGirt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round\r\nSkirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold\r\nAnd colours dipt in Heav’n; the third his feet\r\nShaddowd from either heele with featherd maile\r\nSkie-tinctur’d grain.  Like _Maia’s_ son he stood,\r\nAnd shook his Plumes, that Heav’nly fragrance filld\r\nThe circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands\r\nOf Angels under watch; and to his state,\r\nAnd to his message high in honour rise;\r\nFor on som message high they guessd him bound.\r\nThir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come\r\nInto the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,\r\nAnd flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;\r\nA Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here\r\nWantond as in her prime, and plaid at will\r\nHer Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,\r\nWilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.\r\nHim through the spicie Forrest onward com\r\n_Adam_ discernd, as in the dore he sat\r\nOf his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun\r\nShot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme\r\nEarths inmost womb, more warmth then _Adam_ need;\r\nAnd _Eve_ within, due at her hour prepar’d\r\nFor dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please\r\nTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst\r\nOf nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,\r\nBerrie or Grape: to whom thus _Adam_ call’d.\r\n\r\nHaste hither _Eve_, and worth thy sight behold\r\nEastward among those Trees, what glorious shape\r\nComes this way moving; seems another Morn\r\nRis’n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav’n\r\nTo us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe\r\nThis day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed,\r\nAnd what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure\r\nAbundance, fit to honour and receive\r\nOur Heav’nly stranger; well we may afford\r\nOur givers thir own gifts, and large bestow\r\nFrom large bestowd, where Nature multiplies\r\nHer fertil growth, and by disburd’ning grows\r\nMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Eve_. _Adam_, earths hallowd mould,\r\nOf God inspir’d, small store will serve, where store,\r\nAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;\r\nSave what by frugal storing firmness gains\r\nTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:\r\nBut I will haste and from each bough and break,\r\nEach Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice\r\nTo entertain our Angel guest, as hee\r\nBeholding shall confess that here on Earth\r\nGod hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav’n.\r\n\r\nSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste\r\nShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intent\r\nWhat choice to chuse for delicacie best,\r\nWhat order, so contriv’d as not to mix\r\nTastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring\r\nTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change,\r\nBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk\r\nWhatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds\r\nIn _India_ East or West, or middle shoare\r\nIn _Pontus_ or the _Punic_ Coast, or where\r\n_Alcinous_ reign’d, fruit of all kindes, in coate,\r\nRough, or smooth rin’d, or bearded husk, or shell\r\nShe gathers, Tribute large, and on the board\r\nHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape\r\nShe crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes\r\nFrom many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest\r\nShe tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold\r\nWants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground\r\nWith Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum’d.\r\nMean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet\r\nHis god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train\r\nAccompani’d then with his own compleat\r\nPerfections, in himself was all his state,\r\nMore solemn then the tedious pomp that waits\r\nOn Princes, when thir rich Retinue long\r\nOf Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold\r\nDazles the croud, and sets them all agape.\r\nNeerer his presence _Adam_ though not awd,\r\nYet with submiss approach and reverence meek,\r\nAs to a superior Nature, bowing low,\r\n\r\nThus said.  Native of Heav’n, for other place\r\nNone can then Heav’n such glorious shape contain;\r\nSince by descending from the Thrones above,\r\nThose happie places thou hast deignd a while\r\nTo want, and honour these, voutsafe with us\r\nTwo onely, who yet by sov’ran gift possess\r\nThis spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre\r\nTo rest, and what the Garden choicest bears\r\nTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat\r\nBe over, and the Sun more coole decline.\r\n\r\nWhom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.\r\n_Adam_, I therefore came, nor art thou such\r\nCreated, or such place hast here to dwell,\r\nAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav’n\r\nTo visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre\r\nOreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise\r\nI have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge\r\nThey came, that like _Pomona’s_ Arbour smil’d\r\nWith flourets deck’t and fragrant smells; but _Eve_\r\nUndeckt, save with her self more lovely fair\r\nThen Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign’d\r\nOf three that in Mount _Ida_ naked strove,\r\nStood to entertain her guest from Heav’n; no vaile\r\nShee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme\r\nAlterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel _Haile_\r\nBestowd, the holy salutation us’d\r\nLong after to blest _Marie_, second _Eve_.\r\n\r\nHaile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb\r\nShall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons\r\nThen with these various fruits the Trees of God\r\nHave heap’d this Table.  Rais’d of grassie terf\r\nThir Table was, and mossie seats had round,\r\nAnd on her ample Square from side to side\r\nAll _Autumn_ pil’d, though _Spring_ and _Autumn_ here\r\nDanc’d hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;\r\nNo fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began\r\nOur Authour.  Heav’nly stranger, please to taste\r\nThese bounties which our Nourisher, from whom\r\nAll perfet good unmeasur’d out, descends,\r\nTo us for food and for delight hath caus’d\r\nThe Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps\r\nTo spiritual Natures; only this I know,\r\nThat one Celestial Father gives to all.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives\r\n(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part\r\nSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found\r\nNo ingrateful food: and food alike those pure\r\nIntelligential substances require\r\nAs doth your Rational; and both contain\r\nWithin them every lower facultie\r\nOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,\r\nTasting concoct, digest, assimilate,\r\nAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn.\r\nFor know, whatever was created, needs\r\nTo be sustaind and fed; of Elements\r\nThe grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,\r\nEarth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires\r\nEthereal, and as lowest first the Moon;\r\nWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurg’d\r\nVapours not yet into her substance turnd.\r\nNor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale\r\nFrom her moist Continent to higher Orbes.\r\nThe Sun that light imparts to all, receives\r\nFrom all his alimental recompence\r\nIn humid exhalations, and at Even\r\nSups with the Ocean: though in Heav’n the Trees\r\nOf life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines\r\nYeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn\r\nWe brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground\r\nCover’d with pearly grain: yet God hath here\r\nVaried his bounty so with new delights,\r\nAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste\r\nThink not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,\r\nAnd to thir viands fell, nor seemingly\r\nThe Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss\r\nOf Theologians, but with keen dispatch\r\nOf real hunger, and concoctive heate\r\nTo transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires\r\nThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire\r\nOf sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist\r\nCan turn, or holds it possible to turn\r\nMetals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold\r\nAs from the Mine.  Mean while at Table _Eve_\r\nMinisterd naked, and thir flowing cups\r\nWith pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence\r\nDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,\r\nThen had the Sons of God excuse to have bin\r\nEnamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts\r\nLove unlibidinous reign’d, nor jealousie\r\nWas understood, the injur’d Lovers Hell.\r\n\r\nThus when with meats & drinks they had suffic’d,\r\nNot burd’nd Nature, sudden mind arose\r\nIn _Adam_, not to let th’ occasion pass\r\nGiven him by this great Conference to know\r\nOf things above his World, and of thir being\r\nWho dwell in Heav’n, whose excellence he saw\r\nTranscend his own so farr, whose radiant forms\r\nDivine effulgence, whose high Power so far\r\nExceeded human, and his wary speech\r\nThus to th’ Empyreal Minister he fram’d.\r\n\r\nInhabitant with God, now know I well\r\nThy favour, in this honour done to man,\r\nUnder whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf’t\r\nTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,\r\nFood not of Angels, yet accepted so,\r\nAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem\r\nAt Heav’ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?\r\n\r\n To whom the winged Hierarch repli’d.\r\nO _Adam_, one Almightie is, from whom\r\nAll things proceed, and up to him return,\r\nIf not deprav’d from good, created all\r\nSuch to perfection, one first matter all,\r\nIndu’d with various forms, various degrees\r\nOf substance, and in things that live, of life;\r\nBut more refin’d, more spiritous, and pure,\r\nAs neerer to him plac’t or neerer tending\r\nEach in thir several active Sphears assignd,\r\nTill body up to spirit work, in bounds\r\nProportiond to each kind.  So from the root\r\nSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves\r\nMore aerie, last the bright consummate floure\r\nSpirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit\r\nMans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim’d\r\nTo vital Spirits aspire, to animal,\r\nTo intellectual, give both life and sense,\r\nFansie and understanding, whence the soule\r\nReason receives, and reason is her being,\r\nDiscursive, or Intuitive; discourse\r\nIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,\r\nDiffering but in degree, of kind the same.\r\nWonder not then, what God for you saw good\r\nIf I refuse not, but convert, as you,\r\nTo proper substance; time may come when men\r\nWith Angels may participate, and find\r\nNo inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:\r\nAnd from these corporal nutriments perhaps\r\nYour bodies may at last turn all to Spirit\r\nImprov’d by tract of time, and wingd ascend\r\nEthereal, as wee, or may at choice\r\nHere or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell;\r\nIf ye be found obedient, and retain\r\nUnalterably firm his love entire\r\nWhose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy\r\nYour fill what happiness this happie state\r\nCan comprehend, incapable of more.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Patriarch of mankind repli’d.\r\nO favourable spirit, propitious guest,\r\nWell hast thou taught the way that might direct\r\nOur knowledge, and the scale of Nature set\r\nFrom center to circumference, whereon\r\nIn contemplation of created things\r\nBy steps we may ascend to God.  But say,\r\nWhat meant that caution joind, _If ye be found\r\nobedient?_ can wee want obedience then\r\nTo him, or possibly his love desert\r\nWho formd us from the dust, and plac’d us here\r\nFull to the utmost measure of what bliss\r\nHuman desires can seek or apprehend?\r\n\r\nTo whom the Angel.  Son of Heav’n and Earth,\r\nAttend: That thou art happie, owe to God;\r\nThat thou continu’st such, owe to thy self,\r\nThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand.\r\nThis was that caution giv’n thee; be advis’d.\r\nGod made thee perfet, not immutable;\r\nAnd good he made thee, but to persevere\r\nHe left it in thy power, ordaind thy will\r\nBy nature free, not over-rul’d by Fate\r\nInextricable, or strict necessity;\r\nOur voluntarie service he requires,\r\nNot our necessitated, such with him\r\nFindes no acceptance, nor can find, for how\r\nCan hearts, not free, be tri’d whether they serve\r\nWilling or no, who will but what they must\r\nBy Destinie, and can no other choose?\r\nMy self and all th’ Angelic Host that stand\r\nIn sight of God enthron’d, our happie state\r\nHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;\r\nOn other surety none; freely we serve.\r\nBecause wee freely love, as in our will\r\nTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:\r\nAnd som are fall’n, to disobedience fall’n,\r\nAnd so from Heav’n to deepest Hell; O fall\r\nFrom what high state of bliss into what woe!\r\n\r\nTo whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words\r\nAttentive, and with more delighted eare\r\nDivine instructer, I have heard, then when\r\nCherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills\r\nAereal Music send: nor knew I not\r\nTo be both will and deed created free;\r\nYet that we never shall forget to love\r\nOur maker, and obey him whose command\r\nSingle, is yet so just, my constant thoughts\r\nAssur’d me and still assure: though what thou tellst\r\nHath past in Heav’n, som doubt within me move,\r\nBut more desire to hear, if thou consent,\r\nThe full relation, which must needs be strange,\r\nWorthy of Sacred silence to be heard;\r\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun\r\nHath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins\r\nHis other half in the great Zone of Heav’n.\r\n\r\nThus _Adam_ made request, and _Raphael_\r\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began.\r\n\r\nHigh matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,\r\nSad task and hard, for how shall I relate\r\nTo human sense th’ invisible exploits\r\nOf warring Spirits; how without remorse\r\nThe ruin of so many glorious once\r\nAnd perfet while they stood; how last unfould\r\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps\r\nNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy good\r\nThis is dispenc’t, and what surmounts the reach\r\nOf human sense, I shall delineate so,\r\nBy lik’ning spiritual to corporal forms,\r\nAs may express them best, though what if Earth\r\nBe but the shaddow of Heav’n, and things therein\r\nEach to other like, more then on earth is thought?\r\n\r\nAs yet this world was not, and _Chaos_ wilde\r\nReignd where these Heav’ns now rowl, where Earth now rests\r\nUpon her Center pois’d, when on a day\r\n(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli’d\r\nTo motion, measures all things durable\r\nBy present, past, and future) on such day\r\nAs Heav’ns great Year brings forth, th’ Empyreal Host\r\nOf Angels by Imperial summons call’d,\r\nInnumerable before th’ Almighties Throne\r\nForthwith from all the ends of Heav’n appeerd\r\nUnder thir Hierarchs in orders bright\r\nTen thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc’d,\r\nStandards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare\r\nStreame in the Aire, and for distinction serve\r\nOf Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;\r\nOr in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz’d\r\nHoly Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love\r\nRecorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes\r\nOf circuit inexpressible they stood,\r\nOrb within Orb, the Father infinite,\r\nBy whom in bliss imbosom’d sat the Son,\r\nAmidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop\r\nBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.\r\n\r\nHear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,\r\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\r\nHear my Decree, which unrevok’t shall stand.\r\nThis day I have begot whom I declare\r\nMy onely Son, and on this holy Hill\r\nHim have anointed, whom ye now behold\r\nAt my right hand; your Head I him appoint;\r\nAnd by my Self have sworn to him shall bow\r\nAll knees in Heav’n, and shall confess him Lord:\r\nUnder his great Vice-gerent Reign abide\r\nUnited as one individual Soule\r\nFor ever happie: him who disobeyes\r\nMee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day\r\nCast out from God and blessed vision, falls\r\nInto utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place\r\nOrdaind without redemption, without end.\r\n\r\nSo spake th’ Omnipotent, and with his words\r\nAll seemd well pleas’d, all seem’d, but were not all.\r\nThat day, as other solem dayes, they spent\r\nIn song and dance about the sacred Hill,\r\nMystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare\r\nOf Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles\r\nResembles nearest, mazes intricate,\r\nEccentric, intervolv’d, yet regular\r\nThen most, when most irregular they seem:\r\nAnd in thir motions harmonie Divine\r\nSo smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear\r\nListens delighted.  Eevning approachd\r\n(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,\r\nWe ours for change delectable, not need)\r\nForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn\r\nDesirous, all in Circles as they stood,\r\nTables are set, and on a sudden pil’d\r\nWith Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:\r\nIn Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,\r\nFruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav’n.\r\nThey eat, they drink, and with refection sweet\r\nAre fill’d, before th’ all bounteous King, who showrd\r\nWith copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.\r\nNow when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal’d\r\nFrom that high mount of God, whence light & shade\r\nSpring both, the face of brightest Heav’n had changd\r\nTo grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there\r\nIn darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos’d\r\nAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,\r\nWide over all the Plain, and wider farr\r\nThen all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,\r\n(Such are the Courts of God) Th’ Angelic throng\r\nDisperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend\r\nBy living Streams among the Trees of Life,\r\nPavilions numberless, and sudden reard,\r\nCelestial Tabernacles, where they slept\r\nFannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course\r\nMelodious Hymns about the sovran Throne\r\nAlternate all night long: but not so wak’d\r\n_Satan_, so call him now, his former name\r\nIs heard no more Heav’n; he of the first,\r\nIf not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,\r\nIn favour and praeeminence, yet fraught\r\nWith envie against the Son of God, that day\r\nHonourd by his great Father, and proclaimd\r\n_Messiah_ King anointed, could not beare\r\nThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.\r\nDeep malice thence conceiving & disdain,\r\nSoon as midnight brought on the duskie houre\r\nFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv’d\r\nWith all his Legions to dislodge, and leave\r\nUnworshipt, unobey’d the Throne supream\r\nContemptuous, and his next subordinate\r\nAwak’ning, thus to him in secret spake.\r\n\r\nSleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close\r\nThy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree\r\nOf yesterday, so late hath past the lips\r\nOf Heav’ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts\r\nWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;\r\nBoth waking we were one; how then can now\r\nThy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos’d;\r\nNew Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise\r\nIn us who serve, new Counsels, to debate\r\nWhat doubtful may ensue, more in this place\r\nTo utter is not safe.  Assemble thou\r\nOf all those Myriads which we lead the chief;\r\nTell them that by command, ere yet dim Night\r\nHer shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,\r\nAnd all who under me thir Banners wave,\r\nHomeward with flying march where we possess\r\nThe Quarters of the North, there to prepare\r\nFit entertainment to receive our King\r\nThe great _Messiah_, and his new commands,\r\nWho speedily through all the Hierarchies\r\nIntends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.\r\n\r\nSo spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus’d\r\nBad influence into th’ unwarie brest\r\nOf his Associate; hee together calls,\r\nOr several one by one, the Regent Powers,\r\nUnder him Regent, tells, as he was taught,\r\nThat the most High commanding, now ere Night,\r\nNow ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav’n,\r\nThe great Hierarchal Standard was to move;\r\nTells the suggested cause, and casts between\r\nAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound\r\nOr taint integritie; but all obey’d\r\nThe wonted signal, and superior voice\r\nOf thir great Potentate; for great indeed\r\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heav’n;\r\nHis count’nance, as the Morning Starr that guides\r\nThe starrie flock, allur’d them, and with lyes\r\nDrew after him the third part of Heav’ns Host:\r\nMean while th’ Eternal eye, whose sight discernes\r\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount\r\nAnd from within the golden Lamps that burne\r\nNightly before him, saw without thir light\r\nRebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred\r\nAmong the sons of Morn, what multitudes\r\nWere banded to oppose his high Decree;\r\nAnd smiling to his onely Son thus said.\r\n\r\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold\r\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,\r\nNeerly it now concernes us to be sure\r\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what Arms\r\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim\r\nOf Deitie or Empire, such a foe\r\nIs rising, who intends to erect his Throne\r\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious North;\r\nNor so content, hath in his thought to trie\r\nIn battel, what our Power is, or our right.\r\nLet us advise, and to this hazard draw\r\nWith speed what force is left, and all imploy\r\nIn our defence, lest unawares we lose\r\nThis our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer\r\nLight’ning Divine, ineffable, serene,\r\nMade answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes\r\nJustly hast in derision, and secure\r\nLaugh’st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,\r\nMatter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate\r\nIllustrates, when they see all Regal Power\r\nGiv’n me to quell thir pride, and in event\r\nKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue\r\nThy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav’n.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Son, but _Satan_ with his Powers\r\nFarr was advanc’t on winged speed, an Host\r\nInnumerable as the Starrs of Night,\r\nOr Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun\r\nImpearls on every leaf and every flouer.\r\nRegions they pass’d, the mightie Regencies\r\nOf Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones\r\nIn thir triple Degrees, Regions to which\r\nAll thy Dominion, _Adam_, is no more\r\nThen what this Garden is to all the Earth,\r\nAnd all the Sea, from one entire globose\r\nStretcht into Longitude; which having pass’d\r\nAt length into the limits of the North\r\nThey came, and _Satan_ to his Royal seat\r\nHigh on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount\r\nRais’d on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs\r\nFrom Diamond Quarries hew’n, & Rocks of Gold,\r\nThe Palace of great _Lucifer_, (so call\r\nThat Structure in the Dialect of men\r\nInterpreted) which not long after, hee\r\nAffecting all equality with God,\r\nIn imitation of that Mount whereon\r\n_Messiah_ was declar’d in sight of Heav’n,\r\nThe Mountain of the Congregation call’d;\r\nFor thither he assembl’d all his Train,\r\nPretending so commanded to consult\r\nAbout the great reception of thir King,\r\nThither to come, and with calumnious Art\r\nOf counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.\r\n\r\nThrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,\r\nIf these magnific Titles yet remain\r\nNot meerly titular, since by Decree\r\nAnother now hath to himself ingross’t\r\nAll Power, and us eclipst under the name\r\nOf King anointed, for whom all this haste\r\nOf midnight march, and hurried meeting here,\r\nThis onely to consult how we may best\r\nWith what may be devis’d of honours new\r\nReceive him coming to receive from us\r\nKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,\r\nToo much to one, but double how endur’d,\r\nTo one and to his image now proclaim’d?\r\nBut what if better counsels might erect\r\nOur minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?\r\nWill ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend\r\nThe supple knee? ye will not, if I trust\r\nTo know ye right, or if ye know your selves\r\nNatives and Sons of Heav’n possest before\r\nBy none, and if not equal all, yet free,\r\nEqually free; for Orders and Degrees\r\nJarr not with liberty, but well consist.\r\nWho can in reason then or right assume\r\nMonarchie over such as live by right\r\nHis equals, if in power and splendor less,\r\nIn freedome equal? or can introduce\r\nLaw and Edict on us, who without law\r\nErre not, much less for this to be our Lord,\r\nAnd look for adoration to th’ abuse\r\nOf those Imperial Titles which assert\r\nOur being ordain’d to govern, not to serve?\r\n\r\nThus farr his bold discourse without controule\r\nHad audience, when among the Seraphim\r\n_Abdiel_, then whom none with more zeale ador’d\r\nThe Deitie, and divine commands obei’d,\r\nStood up, and in a flame of zeale severe\r\nThe current of his fury thus oppos’d.\r\n\r\nO argument blasphemous, false and proud!\r\nWords which no eare ever to hear in Heav’n\r\nExpected, least of all from thee, ingrate\r\nIn place thy self so high above thy Peeres.\r\nCanst thou with impious obloquie condemne\r\nThe just Decree of God, pronounc’t and sworn,\r\nThat to his only Son by right endu’d\r\nWith Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav’n\r\nShall bend the knee, and in that honour due\r\nConfess him rightful King? unjust thou saist\r\nFlatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,\r\nAnd equal over equals to let Reigne,\r\nOne over all with unsucceeded power.\r\nShalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute\r\nWith him the points of libertie, who made\r\nThee what thou art, & formd the Pow’rs of Heav’n\r\nSuch as he pleasd, and circumscrib’d thir being?\r\nYet by experience taught we know how good,\r\nAnd of our good, and of our dignitie\r\nHow provident he is, how farr from thought\r\nTo make us less, bent rather to exalt\r\nOur happie state under one Head more neer\r\nUnited.  But to grant it thee unjust,\r\nThat equal over equals Monarch Reigne:\r\nThy self though great & glorious dost thou count,\r\nOr all Angelic Nature joind in one,\r\nEqual to him begotten Son, by whom\r\nAs by his Word the mighty Father made\r\nAll things, ev’n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav’n\r\nBy him created in thir bright degrees,\r\nCrownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam’d\r\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers\r\nEssential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur’d,\r\nBut more illustrious made, since he the Head\r\nOne of our number thus reduc’t becomes,\r\nHis Laws our Laws, all honour to him done\r\nReturns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,\r\nAnd tempt not these; but hast’n to appease\r\nTh’ incensed Father, and th’ incensed Son,\r\nWhile Pardon may be found in time besought.\r\n\r\nSo spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale\r\nNone seconded, as out of season judg’d,\r\nOr singular and rash, whereat rejoic’d\r\nTh’ Apostat, and more haughty thus repli’d.\r\nThat we were formd then saist thou? & the work\r\nOf secondarie hands, by task transferd\r\nFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!\r\nDoctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw\r\nWhen this creation was? rememberst thou\r\nThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?\r\nWe know no time when we were not as now;\r\nKnow none before us, self-begot, self-rais’d\r\nBy our own quick’ning power, when fatal course\r\nHad circl’d his full Orbe, the birth mature\r\nOf this our native Heav’n, Ethereal Sons.\r\nOur puissance is our own, our own right hand\r\nShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try\r\nWho is our equal: then thou shalt behold\r\nWhether by supplication we intend\r\nAddress, and to begirt th’ Almighty Throne\r\nBeseeching or besieging.  This report,\r\nThese tidings carrie to th’ anointed King;\r\nAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\r\n\r\nHe said, and as the sound of waters deep\r\nHoarce murmur echo’d to his words applause\r\nThrough the infinite Host, nor less for that\r\nThe flaming Seraph fearless, though alone\r\nEncompass’d round with foes, thus answerd bold.\r\n\r\nO alienate from God, O spirit accurst,\r\nForsak’n of all good; I see thy fall\r\nDetermind, and thy hapless crew involv’d\r\nIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spred\r\nBoth of thy crime and punishment: henceforth\r\nNo more be troubl’d how to quit the yoke\r\nOf Gods _Messiah_; those indulgent Laws\r\nWill not be now voutsaf’t, other Decrees\r\nAgainst thee are gon forth without recall;\r\nThat Golden Scepter which thou didst reject\r\nIs now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake\r\nThy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise,\r\nYet not for thy advise or threats I fly\r\nThese wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth\r\nImpendent, raging into sudden flame\r\nDistinguish not: for soon expect to feel\r\nHis Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.\r\nThen who created thee lamenting learne,\r\nWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Seraph _Abdiel_ faithful found,\r\nAmong the faithless, faithful only hee;\r\nAmong innumerable false, unmov’d,\r\nUnshak’n, unseduc’d, unterrifi’d\r\nHis Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;\r\nNor number, nor example with him wrought\r\nTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind\r\nThough single.  From amidst them forth he passd,\r\nLong way through hostile scorn, which he susteind\r\nSuperior, nor of violence fear’d aught;\r\nAnd with retorted scorn his back he turn’d\r\nOn those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom’d.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK VI.\r\n\r\nAll night the dreadless Angel unpursu’d\r\nThrough Heav’ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,\r\nWak’t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand\r\nUnbarr’d the gates of Light.  There is a Cave\r\nWithin the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,\r\nWhere light and darkness in perpetual round\r\nLodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav’n\r\nGrateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;\r\nLight issues forth, and at the other dore\r\nObsequious darkness enters, till her houre\r\nTo veile the Heav’n, though darkness there might well\r\nSeem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn\r\nSuch as in highest Heav’n, arrayd in Gold\r\nEmpyreal, from before her vanisht Night,\r\nShot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain\r\nCoverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,\r\nChariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds\r\nReflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:\r\nWarr he perceav’d, warr in procinct, and found\r\nAlready known what he for news had thought\r\nTo have reported: gladly then he mixt\r\nAmong those friendly Powers who him receav’d\r\nWith joy and acclamations loud, that one\r\nThat of so many Myriads fall’n, yet one\r\nReturnd not lost: On to the sacred hill\r\nThey led him high applauded, and present\r\nBefore the seat supream; from whence a voice\r\nFrom midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.\r\n\r\nServant of God, well done, well hast thou fought\r\nThe better fight, who single hast maintaind\r\nAgainst revolted multitudes the Cause\r\nOf Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;\r\nAnd for the testimonie of Truth hast born\r\nUniversal reproach, far worse to beare\r\nThen violence: for this was all thy care\r\nTo stand approv’d in sight of God, though Worlds\r\nJudg’d thee perverse: the easier conquest now\r\nRemains thee, aided by this host of friends,\r\nBack on thy foes more glorious to return\r\nThen scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue\r\nBy force, who reason for thir Law refuse,\r\nRight reason for thir Law, and for thir King\r\n_Messiah_, who by right of merit Reigns.\r\nGoe _Michael_ of Celestial Armies Prince,\r\nAnd thou in Military prowess next\r\n_Gabriel_, lead forth to Battel these my Sons\r\nInvincible, lead forth my armed Saints\r\nBy Thousands and by Millions rang’d for fight;\r\nEqual in number to that Godless crew\r\nRebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms\r\nFearless assault, and to the brow of Heav’n\r\nPursuing drive them out from God and bliss,\r\nInto thir place of punishment, the Gulf\r\nOf _Tartarus_, which ready opens wide\r\nHis fiery _Chaos_ to receave thir fall.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began\r\nTo darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl\r\nIn duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe\r\nOf wrauth awak’t: nor with less dread the loud\r\nEthereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:\r\nAt which command the Powers Militant,\r\nThat stood for Heav’n, in mighty Quadrate joyn’d\r\nOf Union irresistible, mov’d on\r\nIn silence thir bright Legions, to the sound\r\nOf instrumental Harmonie that breath’d\r\nHeroic Ardor to advent’rous deeds\r\nUnder thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause\r\nOf God and his _Messiah_.  On they move\r\nIndissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,\r\nNor streit’ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides\r\nThir perfet ranks; for high above the ground\r\nThir march was, and the passive Air upbore\r\nThir nimble tread; as when the total kind\r\nOf Birds in orderly array on wing\r\nCame summond over _Eden_ to receive\r\nThir names of thee; so over many a tract\r\nOf Heav’n they march’d, and many a Province wide\r\nTenfold the length of this terrene: at last\r\nFarr in th’ Horizon to the North appeer’d\r\nFrom skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht\r\nIn battailous aspect, and neerer view\r\nBristl’d with upright beams innumerable\r\nOf rigid Spears, and Helmets throng’d, and Shields\r\nVarious, with boastful Argument portraid,\r\nThe banded Powers of _Satan_ hasting on\r\nWith furious expedition; for they weend\r\nThat self same day by fight, or by surprize\r\nTo win the Mount of God, and on his Throne\r\nTo set the envier of his State, the proud\r\nAspirer, but thir thoughts prov’d fond and vain\r\nIn the mid way: though strange to us it seemd\r\nAt first, that Angel should with Angel warr,\r\nAnd in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet\r\nSo oft in Festivals of joy and love\r\nUnanimous, as sons of one great Sire\r\nHymning th’ Eternal Father: but the shout\r\nOf Battel now began, and rushing sound\r\nOf onset ended soon each milder thought.\r\nHigh in the midst exalted as a God\r\nTh’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate\r\nIdol of Majestie Divine, enclos’d\r\nWith Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;\r\nThen lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now\r\n’Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,\r\nA dreadful interval, and Front to Front\r\nPresented stood in terrible array\r\nOf hideous length: before the cloudie Van,\r\nOn the rough edge of battel ere it joyn’d,\r\n_Satan_ with vast and haughtie strides advanc’t,\r\nCame towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;\r\n_Abdiel_ that sight endur’d not, where he stood\r\nAmong the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,\r\nAnd thus his own undaunted heart explores.\r\n\r\nO Heav’n! that such resemblance of the Highest\r\nShould yet remain, where faith and realtie\r\nRemain not; wherfore should not strength & might\r\nThere fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove\r\nWhere boldest; though to sight unconquerable?\r\nHis puissance, trusting in th’ Almightie’s aide,\r\nI mean to try, whose Reason I have tri’d\r\nUnsound and false; nor is it aught but just,\r\nThat he who in debate of Truth hath won,\r\nShould win in Arms, in both disputes alike\r\nVictor; though brutish that contest and foule,\r\nWhen Reason hath to deal with force, yet so\r\nMost reason is that Reason overcome.\r\n\r\nSo pondering, and from his armed Peers\r\nForth stepping opposite, half way he met\r\nHis daring foe, at this prevention more\r\nIncens’t, and thus securely him defi’d.\r\n\r\nProud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht\r\nThe highth of thy aspiring unoppos’d,\r\nThe Throne of God unguarded, and his side\r\nAbandond at the terror of thy Power\r\nOr potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain\r\nAgainst th’ Omnipotent to rise in Arms;\r\nWho out of smallest things could without end\r\nHave rais’d incessant Armies to defeat\r\nThy folly; or with solitarie hand\r\nReaching beyond all limit, at one blow\r\nUnaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd\r\nThy Legions under darkness; but thou seest\r\nAll are not of thy Train; there be who Faith\r\nPrefer, and Pietie to God, though then\r\nTo thee not visible, when I alone\r\nSeemd in thy World erroneous to dissent\r\nFrom all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late\r\nHow few somtimes may know, when thousands err.\r\n\r\n  Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance\r\nThus answerd.  Ill for thee, but in wisht houre\r\nOf my revenge, first sought for thou returnst\r\nFrom flight, seditious Angel, to receave\r\nThy merited reward, the first assay\r\nOf this right hand provok’t, since first that tongue\r\nInspir’d with contradiction durst oppose\r\nA third part of the Gods, in Synod met\r\nThir Deities to assert, who while they feel\r\nVigour Divine within them, can allow\r\nOmnipotence to none.  But well thou comst\r\nBefore thy fellows, ambitious to win\r\nFrom me som Plume, that thy success may show\r\nDestruction to the rest: this pause between\r\n(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;\r\nAt first I thought that Libertie and Heav’n\r\nTo heav’nly Soules had bin all one; but now\r\nI see that most through sloth had rather serve,\r\nMinistring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;\r\nSuch hast thou arm’d, the Minstrelsie of Heav’n,\r\nServilitie with freedom to contend,\r\nAs both thir deeds compar’d this day shall prove.\r\n\r\nTo whom in brief thus _Abdiel_ stern repli’d.\r\nApostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find\r\nOf erring, from the path of truth remote:\r\nUnjustly thou deprav’st it with the name\r\nOf _Servitude_ to serve whom God ordains,\r\nOr Nature; God and Nature bid the same,\r\nWhen he who rules is worthiest, and excells\r\nThem whom he governs.  This is servitude,\r\nTo serve th’ unwise, or him who hath rebelld\r\nAgainst his worthier, as thine now serve thee,\r\nThy self not free, but to thy self enthrall’d;\r\nYet leudly dar’st our ministring upbraid.\r\nReign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve\r\nIn Heav’n God ever blessed, and his Divine\r\nBehests obey, worthiest to be obey’d,\r\nYet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while\r\nFrom mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,\r\nThis greeting on thy impious Crest receive.\r\n\r\nSo saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,\r\nWhich hung not, but so swift with tempest fell\r\nOn the proud Crest of _Satan_, that no sight,\r\nNor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield\r\nSuch ruin intercept: ten paces huge\r\nHe back recoild; the tenth on bended knee\r\nHis massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth\r\nWinds under ground or waters forcing way\r\nSidelong, had push’t a Mountain from his seat\r\nHalf sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis’d\r\nThe Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see\r\nThus foil’d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,\r\nPresage of Victorie and fierce desire\r\nOf Battel: whereat _Michael_ bid sound\r\nTh’ Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav’n\r\nIt sounded, and the faithful Armies rung\r\n_Hosanna_ to the Highest: nor stood at gaze\r\nThe adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn’d\r\nThe horrid shock: now storming furie rose,\r\nAnd clamour such as heard in Heav’n till now\r\nWas never, Arms on Armour clashing bray’d\r\nHorrible discord, and the madding Wheeles\r\nOf brazen Chariots rag’d; dire was the noise\r\nOf conflict; over head the dismal hiss\r\nOf fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,\r\nAnd flying vaulted either Host with fire.\r\nSounder fierie Cope together rush’d\r\nBoth Battels maine, with ruinous assault\r\nAnd inextinguishable rage; all Heav’n\r\nResounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth\r\nHad to her Center shook.  What wonder? when\r\nMillions of fierce encountring Angels fought\r\nOn either side, the least of whom could weild\r\nThese Elements, and arm him with the force\r\nOf all thir Regions: how much more of Power\r\nArmie against Armie numberless to raise\r\nDreadful combustion warring, and disturb,\r\nThough not destroy, thir happie Native seat;\r\nHad not th’ Eternal King Omnipotent\r\nFrom his strong hold of Heav’n high over-rul’d\r\nAnd limited thir might; though numberd such\r\nAs each divided Legion might have seemd\r\nA numerous Host, in strength each armed hand\r\nA Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd\r\nEach Warriour single as in Chief, expert\r\nWhen to advance, or stand, or turn the sway\r\nOf Battel, open when, and when to close\r\nThe ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,\r\nNone of retreat, no unbecoming deed\r\nThat argu’d fear; each on himself reli’d,\r\nAs onely in his arm the moment lay\r\nOf victorie; deeds of eternal fame\r\nWere don, but infinite: for wide was spred\r\nThat Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground\r\nA standing fight, then soaring on main wing\r\nTormented all the Air; all Air seemd then\r\nConflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale\r\nThe Battel hung; till _Satan_, who that day\r\nProdigious power had shewn, and met in Armes\r\nNo equal, raunging through the dire attack\r\nOf fighting Seraphim confus’d, at length\r\nSaw where the Sword of _Michael_ smote, and fell’d\r\nSquadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway\r\nBrandisht aloft the horrid edge came down\r\nWide wasting; such destruction to withstand\r\nHe hasted, and oppos’d the rockie Orb\r\nOf tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield\r\nA vast circumference: At his approach\r\nThe great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile\r\nSurceas’d, and glad as hoping here to end\r\nIntestine War in Heav’n, the arch foe subdu’d\r\nOr Captive drag’d in Chains, with hostile frown\r\nAnd visage all enflam’d first thus began.\r\n\r\nAuthor of evil, unknown till thy revolt,\r\nUnnam’d in Heav’n, now plenteous, as thou seest\r\nThese Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,\r\nThough heaviest by just measure on thy self\r\nAnd thy adherents: how hast thou disturb’d\r\nHeav’ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought\r\nMiserie, uncreated till the crime\r\nOf thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill’d\r\nThy malice into thousands, once upright\r\nAnd faithful, now prov’d false.  But think not here\r\nTo trouble Holy Rest; Heav’n casts thee out\r\nFrom all her Confines.  Heav’n the seat of bliss\r\nBrooks not the works of violence and Warr.\r\nHence then, and evil go with thee along\r\nThy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,\r\nThou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,\r\nEre this avenging Sword begin thy doome,\r\nOr som more sudden vengeance wing’d from God\r\nPrecipitate thee with augmented paine.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus\r\nThe Adversarie.  Nor think thou with wind\r\nOf airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds\r\nThou canst not.  Hast thou turnd the least of these\r\nTo flight, or if to fall, but that they rise\r\nUnvanquisht, easier to transact with mee\r\nThat thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats\r\nTo chase me hence? erre not that so shall end\r\nThe strife which thou call’st evil, but wee style\r\nThe strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,\r\nOr turn this Heav’n it self into the Hell\r\nThou fablest, here however to dwell free,\r\nIf not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,\r\nAnd join him nam’d _Almightie_ to thy aid,\r\nI flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.\r\n\r\nThey ended parle, and both addrest for fight\r\nUnspeakable; for who, though with the tongue\r\nOf Angels, can relate, or to what things\r\nLiken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift\r\nHuman imagination to such highth\r\nOf Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,\r\nStood they or mov’d, in stature, motion, arms\r\nFit to decide the Empire of great Heav’n.\r\nNow wav’d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire\r\nMade horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields\r\nBlaz’d opposite, while expectation stood\r\nIn horror; from each hand with speed retir’d\r\nWhere erst was thickest fight, th’ Angelic throng,\r\nAnd left large field, unsafe within the wind\r\nOf such commotion, such as to set forth\r\nGreat things by small, If Natures concord broke,\r\nAmong the Constellations warr were sprung,\r\nTwo Planets rushing from aspect maligne\r\nOf fiercest opposition in mid Skie,\r\nShould combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.\r\nTogether both with next to Almightie Arme,\r\nUplifted imminent one stroke they aim’d\r\nThat might determine, and not need repeate,\r\nAs not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd\r\nIn might or swift prevention; but the sword\r\nOf _Michael_ from the Armorie of God\r\nWas giv’n him temperd so, that neither keen\r\nNor solid might resist that edge: it met\r\nThe sword of _Satan_ with steep force to smite\r\nDescending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,\r\nBut with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar’d\r\nAll his right side; then _Satan_ first knew pain,\r\nAnd writh’d him to and fro convolv’d; so sore\r\nThe griding sword with discontinuous wound\r\nPass’d through him, but th’ Ethereal substance clos’d\r\nNot long divisible, and from the gash\r\nA stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow’d\r\nSanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,\r\nAnd all his Armour staind ere while so bright.\r\nForthwith on all sides to his aide was run\r\nBy Angels many and strong, who interpos’d\r\nDefence, while others bore him on thir Shields\r\nBack to his Chariot; where it stood retir’d\r\nFrom off the files of warr; there they him laid\r\nGnashing for anguish and despite and shame\r\nTo find himself not matchless, and his pride\r\nHumbl’d by such rebuke, so farr beneath\r\nHis confidence to equal God in power.\r\nYet soon he heal’d; for Spirits that live throughout\r\nVital in every part, not as frail man\r\nIn Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,\r\nCannot but by annihilating die;\r\nNor in thir liquid texture mortal wound\r\nReceive, no more then can the fluid Aire:\r\nAll Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,\r\nAll Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,\r\nThey Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size\r\nAssume, as likes them best, condense or rare.\r\n\r\nMean while in other parts like deeds deservd\r\nMemorial, where the might of _Gabriel_ fought,\r\nAnd with fierce Ensignes pierc’d the deep array\r\nOf _Moloc_ furious King, who him defi’d,\r\nAnd at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound\r\nThreatn’d, nor from the Holie One of Heav’n\r\nRefrein’d his tongue blasphemous; but anon\r\nDown clov’n to the waste, with shatterd Armes\r\nAnd uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing\r\n_Uriel_ and _Raphael_ his vaunting foe,\r\nThough huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,\r\nVanquish’d _Adramelec_, and _Asmadai_,\r\nTwo potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods\r\nDisdain’d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,\r\nMangl’d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.\r\nNor stood unmindful _Abdiel_ to annoy\r\nThe Atheist crew, but with redoubl’d blow\r\n_Ariel_ and _Arioc_, and the violence\r\nOf _Ramiel_ scorcht and blasted overthrew.\r\nI might relate of thousands, and thir names\r\nEternize here on Earth; but those elect\r\nAngels contented with thir fame in Heav’n\r\nSeek not the praise of men: the other sort\r\nIn might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,\r\nNor of Renown less eager, yet by doome\r\nCanceld from Heav’n and sacred memorie,\r\nNameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.\r\nFor strength from Truth divided and from Just,\r\nIllaudable, naught merits but dispraise\r\nAnd ignominie, yet to glorie aspires\r\nVain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:\r\nTherfore Eternal silence be thir doome.\r\n\r\nAnd now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv’d,\r\nWith many an inrode gor’d; deformed rout\r\nEnter’d, and foul disorder; all the ground\r\nWith shiverd armour strow’n, and on a heap\r\nChariot and Charioter lay overturnd\r\nAnd fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld\r\nOrewearied, through the faint Satanic Host\r\nDefensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris’d,\r\nThen first with fear surpris’d and sense of paine\r\nFled ignominious, to such evil brought\r\nBy sinne of disobedience, till that hour\r\nNot liable to fear or flight or paine.\r\nFar otherwise th’ inviolable Saints\r\nIn Cubic Phalanx firm advanc’t entire,\r\nInvulnerable, impenitrably arm’d:\r\nSuch high advantages thir innocence\r\nGave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,\r\nNot to have disobei’d; in fight they stood\r\nUnwearied, unobnoxious to be pain’d\r\nBy wound, though from thir place by violence mov’d.\r\n\r\nNow Night her course began, and over Heav’n\r\nInducing darkness, grateful truce impos’d,\r\nAnd silence on the odious dinn of Warr:\r\nUnder her Cloudie covert both retir’d,\r\nVictor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field\r\n_Michael_ and his Angels prevalent\r\nEncamping, plac’d in Guard thir Watches round,\r\nCherubic waving fires: on th’ other part\r\n_Satan_ with his rebellious disappeerd,\r\nFar in the dark dislodg’d, and void of rest,\r\nHis Potentates to Councel call’d by night;\r\nAnd in the midst thus undismai’d began.\r\n\r\nO now in danger tri’d, now known in Armes\r\nNot to be overpowerd, Companions deare,\r\nFound worthy not of Libertie alone,\r\nToo mean pretense, but what we more affect,\r\nHonour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,\r\nWho have sustaind one day in doubtful fight,\r\n(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)\r\nWhat Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send\r\nAgainst us from about his Throne, and judg’d\r\nSufficient to subdue us to his will,\r\nBut proves not so: then fallible, it seems,\r\nOf future we may deem him, though till now\r\nOmniscient thought.  True is, less firmly arm’d,\r\nSome disadvantage we endur’d and paine,\r\nTill now not known, but known as soon contemnd,\r\nSince now we find this our Empyreal forme\r\nIncapable of mortal injurie\r\nImperishable, and though peirc’d with wound,\r\nSoon closing, and by native vigour heal’d.\r\nOf evil then so small as easie think\r\nThe remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,\r\nWeapons more violent, when next we meet,\r\nMay serve to better us, and worse our foes,\r\nOr equal what between us made the odds,\r\nIn Nature none: if other hidden cause\r\nLeft them Superiour, while we can preserve\r\nUnhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,\r\nDue search and consultation will disclose.\r\n\r\nHe sat; and in th’ assembly next upstood\r\n_Nisroc_, of Principalities the prime;\r\nAs one he stood escap’t from cruel fight,\r\nSore toild, his riv’n Armes to havoc hewn,\r\nAnd cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.\r\nDeliverer from new Lords, leader to free\r\nEnjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard\r\nFor Gods, and too unequal work we find\r\nAgainst unequal armes to fight in paine,\r\nAgainst unpaind, impassive; from which evil\r\nRuin must needs ensue; for what availes\r\nValour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain\r\nWhich all subdues, and makes remiss the hands\r\nOf Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well\r\nSpare out of life perhaps, and not repine,\r\nBut live content, which is the calmest life:\r\nBut pain is perfet miserie, the worst\r\nOf evils, and excessive, overturnes\r\nAll patience.  He who therefore can invent\r\nWith what more forcible we may offend\r\nOur yet unwounded Enemies, or arme\r\nOur selves with like defence, to mee deserves\r\nNo less then for deliverance what we owe.\r\n\r\nWhereto with look compos’d _Satan_ repli’d.\r\nNot uninvented that, which thou aright\r\nBeleivst so main to our success, I bring;\r\nWhich of us who beholds the bright surface\r\nOf this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,\r\nThis continent of spacious Heav’n, adornd\r\nWith Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold,\r\nWhose Eye so superficially surveyes\r\nThese things, as not to mind from whence they grow\r\nDeep under ground, materials dark and crude,\r\nOf spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht\r\nWith Heav’ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth\r\nSo beauteous, op’ning to the ambient light.\r\nThese in thir dark Nativitie the Deep\r\nShall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame,\r\nWhich into hallow Engins long and round\r\nThick-rammd, at th’ other bore with touch of fire\r\nDilated and infuriate shall send forth\r\nFrom far with thundring noise among our foes\r\nSuch implements of mischief as shall dash\r\nTo pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands\r\nAdverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd\r\nThe Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.\r\nNor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,\r\nEffect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;\r\nAbandon fear; to strength and counsel joind\r\nThink nothing hard, much less to be despaird.\r\nHe ended, and his words thir drooping chere\r\nEnlightn’d, and thir languisht hope reviv’d.\r\nTh’ invention all admir’d, and each, how hee\r\nTo be th’ inventer miss’d, so easie it seemd\r\nOnce found, which yet unfound most would have thought\r\nImpossible: yet haply of thy Race\r\nIn future dayes, if Malice should abound,\r\nSome one intent on mischief, or inspir’d\r\nWith dev’lish machination might devise\r\nLike instrument to plague the Sons of men\r\nFor sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.\r\nForthwith from Councel to the work they flew,\r\nNone arguing stood, innumerable hands\r\nWere ready, in a moment up they turnd\r\nWide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath\r\nTh’ originals of Nature in thir crude\r\nConception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame\r\nThey found, they mingl’d, and with suttle Art,\r\nConcocted and adusted they reduc’d\r\nTo blackest grain, and into store conveyd:\r\nPart hidd’n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth\r\nEntrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,\r\nWhereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls\r\nOf missive ruin; part incentive reed\r\nProvide, pernicious with one touch to fire.\r\nSo all ere day spring, under conscious Night\r\nSecret they finish’d, and in order set,\r\nWith silent circumspection unespi’d.\r\nNow when fair Morn Orient in Heav’n appeerd\r\nUp rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms\r\nThe matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood\r\nOf Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,\r\nSoon banded; others from the dawning Hills\r\nLookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,\r\nEach quarter, to descrie the distant foe,\r\nWhere lodg’d, or whither fled, or if for fight,\r\nIn motion or in alt: him soon they met\r\nUnder spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow\r\nBut firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail\r\n_Zephiel_, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,\r\nCame flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri’d.\r\n\r\nArme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,\r\nWhom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit\r\nThis day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud\r\nHe comes, and settl’d in his face I see\r\nSad resolution and secure: let each\r\nHis Adamantine coat gird well, and each\r\nFit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,\r\nBorn eevn or high, for this day will pour down,\r\nIf I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,\r\nBut ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.\r\nSo warnd he them aware themselves, and soon\r\nIn order, quit of all impediment;\r\nInstant without disturb they took Allarm,\r\nAnd onward move Embattelld; when behold\r\nNot distant far with heavie pace the Foe\r\nApproaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube\r\nTraining his devilish Enginrie, impal’d\r\nOn every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,\r\nTo hide the fraud.  At interview both stood\r\nA while, but suddenly at head appeerd\r\n_Satan_: And thus was heard Commanding loud.\r\n\r\nVangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;\r\nThat all may see who hate us, how we seek\r\nPeace and composure, and with open brest\r\nStand readie to receive them, if they like\r\nOur overture, and turn not back perverse;\r\nBut that I doubt, however witness Heaven,\r\nHeav’n witness thou anon, while we discharge\r\nFreely our part: yee who appointed stand\r\nDo as you have in charge, and briefly touch\r\nWhat we propound, and loud that all may hear.\r\n\r\nSo scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce\r\nHad ended; when to Right and Left the Front\r\nDivided, and to either Flank retir’d.\r\nWhich to our eyes discoverd new and strange,\r\nA triple-mounted row of Pillars laid\r\nOn Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem’d\r\nOr hollow’d bodies made of Oak or Firr\r\nWith branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell’d)\r\nBrass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes\r\nWith hideous orifice gap’t on us wide,\r\nPortending hollow truce; at each behind\r\nA Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed\r\nStood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,\r\nCollected stood within our thoughts amus’d,\r\nNot long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds\r\nPut forth, and to a narrow vent appli’d\r\nWith nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,\r\nBut soon obscur’d with smoak, all Heav’n appeerd,\r\nFrom those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar\r\nEmboweld with outragious noise the Air,\r\nAnd all her entrails tore, disgorging foule\r\nThir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail\r\nOf Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host\r\nLevel’d, with such impetuous furie smote,\r\nThat whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,\r\nThough standing else as Rocks, but down they fell\r\nBy thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl’d;\r\nThe sooner for thir Arms, unarm’d they might\r\nHave easily as Spirits evaded swift\r\nBy quick contraction or remove; but now\r\nFoule dissipation follow’d and forc’t rout;\r\nNor serv’d it to relax thir serried files.\r\nWhat should they do? if on they rusht, repulse\r\nRepeated, and indecent overthrow\r\nDoubl’d, would render them yet more despis’d,\r\nAnd to thir foes a laughter; for in view\r\nStood rankt of Seraphim another row\r\nIn posture to displode thir second tire\r\nOf Thunder: back defeated to return\r\nThey worse abhorr’d.  _Satan_ beheld thir plight,\r\nAnd to his Mates thus in derision call’d.\r\n\r\nO Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?\r\nEre while they fierce were coming, and when wee,\r\nTo entertain them fair with open Front\r\nAnd Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms\r\nOf composition, strait they chang’d thir minds,\r\nFlew off, and into strange vagaries fell,\r\nAs they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd\r\nSomwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps\r\nFor joy of offerd peace: but I suppose\r\nIf our proposals once again were heard\r\nWe should compel them to a quick result.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Belial_ in like gamesom mood.\r\nLeader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,\r\nOf hard contents, and full of force urg’d home,\r\nSuch as we might perceive amus’d them all,\r\nAnd stumbl’d many, who receives them right,\r\nHad need from head to foot well understand;\r\nNot understood, this gift they have besides,\r\nThey shew us when our foes walk not upright.\r\n\r\nSo they among themselves in pleasant veine\r\nStood scoffing, highthn’d in thir thoughts beyond\r\nAll doubt of Victorie, eternal might\r\nTo match with thir inventions they presum’d\r\nSo easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,\r\nAnd all his Host derided, while they stood\r\nA while in trouble; but they stood not long,\r\nRage prompted them at length, & found them arms\r\nAgainst such hellish mischief fit to oppose.\r\nForthwith (behold the excellence, the power\r\nWhich God hath in his mighty Angels plac’d)\r\nThir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills\r\n(For Earth hath this variety from Heav’n\r\nOf pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)\r\nLight as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,\r\nFrom thir foundations loosning to and fro\r\nThey pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,\r\nRocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops\r\nUp lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,\r\nBe sure, and terrour seis’d the rebel Host,\r\nWhen coming towards them so dread they saw\r\nThe bottom of the Mountains upward turn’d,\r\nTill on those cursed Engins triple-row\r\nThey saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence\r\nUnder the weight of Mountains buried deep,\r\nThemselves invaded next, and on thir heads\r\nMain Promontories flung, which in the Air\r\nCame shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm’d,\r\nThir armor help’d thir harm, crush’t in and brus’d\r\nInto thir substance pent, which wrought them pain\r\nImplacable, and many a dolorous groan,\r\nLong strugling underneath, ere they could wind\r\nOut of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,\r\nPurest at first, now gross by sinning grown.\r\nThe rest in imitation to like Armes\r\nBetook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;\r\nSo Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills\r\nHurl’d to and fro with jaculation dire,\r\nThat under ground they fought in dismal shade;\r\nInfernal noise; Warr seem’d a civil Game\r\nTo this uproar; horrid confusion heapt\r\nUpon confusion rose: and now all Heav’n\r\nHad gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,\r\nHad not th’ Almightie Father where he sits\r\nShrin’d in his Sanctuarie of Heav’n secure,\r\nConsulting on the sum of things, foreseen\r\nThis tumult, and permitted all, advis’d:\r\nThat his great purpose he might so fulfill,\r\nTo honour his Anointed Son aveng’d\r\nUpon his enemies, and to declare\r\nAll power on him transferr’d: whence to his Son\r\nTh’ Assessor of his Throne he thus began.\r\n\r\nEffulgence of my Glorie, Son belov’d,\r\nSon in whose face invisible is beheld\r\nVisibly, what by Deitie I am,\r\nAnd in whose hand what by Decree I doe,\r\nSecond Omnipotence, two dayes are past,\r\nTwo dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,\r\nSince _Michael_ and his Powers went forth to tame\r\nThese disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,\r\nAs likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;\r\nFor to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,\r\nEqual in their Creation they were form’d,\r\nSave what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought\r\nInsensibly, for I suspend thir doom;\r\nWhence in perpetual fight they needs must last\r\nEndless, and no solution will be found:\r\nWarr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,\r\nAnd to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,\r\nWith Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makes\r\nWild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.\r\nTwo dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;\r\nFor thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farr\r\nHave sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine\r\nOf ending this great Warr, since none but Thou\r\nCan end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace\r\nImmense I have transfus’d, that all may know\r\nIn Heav’n and Hell thy Power above compare,\r\nAnd this perverse Commotion governd thus,\r\nTo manifest thee worthiest to be Heir\r\nOf all things, to be Heir and to be King\r\nBy Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.\r\nGo then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,\r\nAscend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles\r\nThat shake Heav’ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,\r\nMy Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms\r\nGird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;\r\nPursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out\r\nFrom all Heav’ns bounds into the utter Deep:\r\nThere let them learn, as likes them, to despise\r\nGod and _Messiah_ his anointed King.\r\n\r\nHe said, and on his Son with Rayes direct\r\nShon full, he all his Father full exprest\r\nIneffably into his face receiv’d,\r\nAnd thus the filial Godhead answering spake.\r\n\r\nO Father, O Supream of heav’nly Thrones,\r\nFirst, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst\r\nTo glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,\r\nAs is most just; this I my Glorie account,\r\nMy exaltation, and my whole delight,\r\nThat thou in me well pleas’d, declarst thy will\r\nFulfill’d, which to fulfil is all my bliss.\r\nScepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,\r\nAnd gladlier shall resign, when in the end\r\nThou shalt be All in All, and I in thee\r\nFor ever, and in mee all whom thou lov’st:\r\nBut whom thou hat’st, I hate, and can put on\r\nThy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,\r\nImage of thee in all things; and shall soon,\r\nArmd with thy might, rid heav’n of these rebell’d,\r\nTo thir prepar’d ill Mansion driven down\r\nTo chains of Darkness, and th’ undying Worm,\r\nThat from thy just obedience could revolt,\r\nWhom to obey is happiness entire.\r\nThen shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th’ impure\r\nFarr separate, circling thy holy Mount\r\nUnfained _Halleluiahs_ to thee sing,\r\nHymns of high praise, and I among them chief.\r\nSo said, he o’re his Scepter bowing, rose\r\nFrom the right hand of Glorie where he sate,\r\nAnd the third sacred Morn began to shine\r\nDawning through Heav’n: forth rush’d with whirlwind sound\r\nThe Chariot of Paternal Deitie,\r\nFlashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,\r\nIt self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd\r\nBy four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each\r\nHad wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all\r\nAnd Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels\r\nOf Beril, and careering Fires between;\r\nOver thir heads a chrystal Firmament,\r\nWhereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure\r\nAmber, and colours of the showrie Arch.\r\nHee in Celestial Panoplie all armd\r\nOf radiant _Urim_, work divinely wrought,\r\nAscended, at his right hand Victorie\r\nSate Eagle-wing’d, beside him hung his Bow\r\nAnd Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor’d,\r\nAnd from about him fierce Effusion rowld\r\nOf smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;\r\nAttended with ten thousand thousand Saints,\r\nHe onward came, farr off his coming shon,\r\nAnd twentie thousand (I thir number heard)\r\nChariots of God, half on each hand were seen:\r\nHee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime\r\nOn the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron’d.\r\nIllustrious farr and wide, but by his own\r\nFirst seen, them unexpected joy surpriz’d,\r\nWhen the great Ensign of _Messiah_ blaz’d\r\nAloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav’n:\r\nUnder whose Conduct _Michael_ soon reduc’d\r\nHis Armie, circumfus’d on either Wing,\r\nUnder thir Head imbodied all in one.\r\nBefore him Power Divine his way prepar’d;\r\nAt his command the uprooted Hills retir’d\r\nEach to his place, they heard his voice and went\r\nObsequious, Heav’n his wonted face renewd,\r\nAnd with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil’d.\r\nThis saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur’d,\r\nAnd to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers\r\nInsensate, hope conceiving from despair.\r\nIn heav’nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?\r\nBut to convince the proud what Signs availe,\r\nOr Wonders move th’ obdurate to relent?\r\nThey hard’nd more by what might most reclame,\r\nGrieving to see his Glorie, at the sight\r\nTook envie, and aspiring to his highth,\r\nStood reimbattell’d fierce, by force or fraud\r\nWeening to prosper, and at length prevaile\r\nAgainst God and _Messiah_, or to fall\r\nIn universal ruin last, and now\r\nTo final Battel drew, disdaining flight,\r\nOr faint retreat; when the great Son of God\r\nTo all his Host on either hand thus spake.\r\n\r\nStand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand\r\nYe Angels arm’d, this day from Battel rest;\r\nFaithful hath been your Warfare, and of God\r\nAccepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,\r\nAnd as ye have receivd, so have ye don\r\nInvincibly; but of this cursed crew\r\nThe punishment to other hand belongs,\r\nVengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;\r\nNumber to this dayes work is not ordain’d\r\nNor multitude, stand onely and behold\r\nGods indignation on these Godless pourd\r\nBy mee; not you but mee they have despis’d,\r\nYet envied; against mee is all thir rage,\r\nBecause the Father, t’ whom in Heav’n supream\r\nKingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,\r\nHath honourd me according to his will.\r\nTherefore to mee thir doom he hath assig’n’d;\r\nThat they may have thir wish, to trie with mee\r\nIn Battel which the stronger proves, they all,\r\nOr I alone against them, since by strength\r\nThey measure all, of other excellence\r\nNot emulous, nor care who them excells;\r\nNor other strife with them do I voutsafe.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Son, and into terrour chang’d\r\nHis count’nance too severe to be beheld\r\nAnd full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.\r\nAt once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings\r\nWith dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes\r\nOf his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound\r\nOf torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.\r\nHee on his impious Foes right onward drove,\r\nGloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles\r\nThe stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,\r\nAll but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon\r\nAmong them he arriv’d; in his right hand\r\nGrasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent\r\nBefore him, such as in thir Soules infix’d\r\nPlagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,\r\nAll courage; down thir idle weapons drop’d;\r\nO’re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode\r\nOf Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,\r\nThat wish’d the Mountains now might be again\r\nThrown on them as a shelter from his ire.\r\nNor less on either side tempestuous fell\r\nHis arrows, from the fourfold-visag’d Foure,\r\nDistinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,\r\nDistinct alike with multitude of eyes,\r\nOne Spirit in them rul’d, and every eye\r\nGlar’d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire\r\nAmong th’ accurst, that witherd all thir strength,\r\nAnd of thir wonted vigour left them draind,\r\nExhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall’n.\r\nYet half his strength he put not forth, but check’d\r\nHis Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant\r\nNot to destroy, but root them out of Heav’n:\r\nThe overthrown he rais’d, and as a Heard\r\nOf Goats or timerous flock together throngd\r\nDrove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu’d\r\nWith terrors and with furies to the bounds\r\nAnd Chrystall wall of Heav’n, which op’ning wide,\r\nRowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos’d\r\nInto the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight\r\nStrook them with horror backward, but far worse\r\nUrg’d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw\r\nDown from the verge of Heav’n, Eternal wrauth\r\nBurnt after them to the bottomless pit.\r\n\r\nHell heard th’ unsufferable noise, Hell saw\r\nHeav’n ruining from Heav’n and would have fled\r\nAffrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep\r\nHer dark foundations, and too fast had bound.\r\nNine dayes they fell; confounded _Chaos_ roard,\r\nAnd felt tenfold confusion in thir fall\r\nThrough his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout\r\nIncumberd him with ruin: Hell at last\r\nYawning receavd them whole, and on them clos’d,\r\nHell thir fit habitation fraught with fire\r\nUnquenchable, the house of woe and paine.\r\nDisburd’nd Heav’n rejoic’d, and soon repaird\r\nHer mural breach, returning whence it rowld.\r\nSole Victor from th’ expulsion of his Foes\r\n_Messiah_ his triumphal Chariot turnd:\r\nTo meet him all his Saints, who silent stood\r\nEye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,\r\nWith Jubilie advanc’d; and as they went,\r\nShaded with branching Palme, each order bright,\r\nSung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,\r\nSon, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv’n,\r\nWorthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode\r\nTriumphant through mid Heav’n, into the Courts\r\nAnd Temple of his mightie Father Thron’d\r\nOn high; who into Glorie him receav’d,\r\nWhere now he sits at the right hand of bliss.\r\n\r\nThus measuring things in Heav’n by things on Earth\r\nAt thy request, and that thou maist beware\r\nBy what is past, to thee I have reveal’d\r\nWhat might have else to human Race bin hid;\r\nThe discord which befel, and Warr in Heav’n\r\nAmong th’ Angelic Powers, and the deep fall\r\nOf those too high aspiring, who rebelld\r\nWith _Satan_, hee who envies now thy state,\r\nWho now is plotting how he may seduce\r\nThee also from obedience, that with him\r\nBereavd of happiness thou maist partake\r\nHis punishment, Eternal miserie;\r\nWhich would be all his solace and revenge,\r\nAs a despite don against the most High,\r\nThee once to gaine Companion of his woe.\r\nBut list’n not to his Temptations, warne\r\nThy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard\r\nBy terrible Example the reward\r\nOf disobedience; firm they might have stood,\r\nYet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE SIXTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK VII.\r\n\r\nDescend from Heav’n _Urania_, by that name\r\nIf rightly thou art call’d, whose Voice divine\r\nFollowing, above th’ _Olympian_ Hill I soare,\r\nAbove the flight of _Pegasean_ wing.\r\nThe meaning, not the Name I call: for thou\r\nNor of the Muses nine, nor on the top\r\nOf old _Olympus_ dwell’st, but Heav’nlie borne,\r\nBefore the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow’d,\r\nThou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,\r\nWisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play\r\nIn presence of th’ Almightie Father, pleas’d\r\nWith thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee\r\nInto the Heav’n of Heav’ns I have presum’d,\r\nAn Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,\r\nThy tempring; with like safetie guided down\r\nReturn me to my Native Element:\r\nLeast from this flying Steed unrein’d, (as once\r\n_Bellerophon_, though from a lower Clime)\r\nDismounted, on th’ _Aleian_ Field I fall\r\nErroneous, there to wander and forlorne.\r\nHalf yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound\r\nWithin the visible Diurnal Spheare;\r\nStanding on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,\r\nMore safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang’d\r\nTo hoarce or mute, though fall’n on evil dayes,\r\nOn evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;\r\nIn darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,\r\nAnd solitude; yet not alone, while thou\r\nVisit’st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn\r\nPurples the East: still govern thou my Song,\r\n_Urania_, and fit audience find, though few.\r\nBut drive farr off the barbarous dissonance\r\nOf _Bacchus_ and his Revellers, the Race\r\nOf that wilde Rout that tore the _Thracian_ Bard\r\nIn _Rhodope_, where Woods and Rocks had Eares\r\nTo rapture, till the savage clamor dround\r\nBoth Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend\r\nHer Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:\r\nFor thou art Heav’nlie, shee an empty dreame.\r\n\r\nSay Goddess, what ensu’d when _Raphael_,\r\nThe affable Arch-angel, had forewarn’d\r\n_Adam_ by dire example to beware\r\nApostasie, by what befell in Heaven\r\nTo those Apostates, least the like befall\r\nIn Paradise to _Adam_ or his Race,\r\nCharg’d not to touch the interdicted Tree,\r\nIf they transgress, and slight that sole command,\r\nSo easily obeyd amid the choice\r\nOf all tasts else to please thir appetite,\r\nThough wandring.  He with his consorted _Eve_\r\nThe storie heard attentive, and was fill’d\r\nWith admiration, and deep Muse to heare\r\nOf things so high and strange, things to thir thought\r\nSo unimaginable as hate in Heav’n,\r\nAnd Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss\r\nWith such confusion: but the evil soon\r\nDriv’n back redounded as a flood on those\r\nFrom whom it sprung, impossible to mix\r\nWith Blessedness.  Whence _Adam_ soon repeal’d\r\nThe doubts that in his heart arose: and now\r\nLed on, yet sinless, with desire to know\r\nWhat neerer might concern him, how this World\r\nOf Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,\r\nWhen, and whereof created, for what cause,\r\nWhat within _Eden_ or without was done\r\nBefore his memorie, as one whose drouth\r\nYet scarce allay’d still eyes the current streame,\r\nWhose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,\r\nProceeded thus to ask his Heav’nly Guest.\r\n\r\nGreat things, and full of wonder in our eares,\r\nFarr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d\r\nDivine Interpreter, by favour sent\r\nDown from the Empyrean to forewarne\r\nUs timely of what might else have bin our loss,\r\nUnknown, which human knowledg could not reach:\r\nFor which to the infinitly Good we owe\r\nImmortal thanks, and his admonishment\r\nReceave with solemne purpose to observe\r\nImmutably his sovran will, the end\r\nOf what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf’t\r\nGently for our instruction to impart\r\nThings above Earthly thought, which yet concernd\r\nOur knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,\r\nDeign to descend now lower, and relate\r\nWhat may no less perhaps availe us known,\r\nHow first began this Heav’n which we behold\r\nDistant so high, with moving Fires adornd\r\nInnumerable, and this which yeelds or fills\r\nAll space, the ambient Aire wide interfus’d\r\nImbracing round this florid Earth, what cause\r\nMov’d the Creator in his holy Rest\r\nThrough all Eternitie so late to build\r\nIn _Chaos_, and the work begun, how soon\r\nAbsolv’d, if unforbid thou maist unfould\r\nWhat wee, not to explore the secrets aske\r\nOf his Eternal Empire, but the more\r\nTo magnifie his works, the more we know.\r\nAnd the great Light of Day yet wants to run\r\nMuch of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav’n\r\nHeld by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,\r\nAnd longer will delay to heare thee tell\r\nHis Generation, and the rising Birth\r\nOf Nature from the unapparent Deep:\r\nOr if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon\r\nHaste to thy audience, Night with her will bring\r\nSilence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,\r\nOr we can bid his absence, till thy Song\r\nEnd, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.\r\n\r\nThus _Adam_ his illustrous Guest besought:\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.\r\nThis also thy request with caution askt\r\nObtaine: though to recount Almightie works\r\nWhat words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,\r\nOr heart of man suffice to comprehend?\r\nYet what thou canst attain, which best may serve\r\nTo glorifie the Maker, and inferr\r\nThee also happier, shall not be withheld\r\nThy hearing, such Commission from above\r\nI have receav’d, to answer thy desire\r\nOf knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain\r\nTo ask, nor let thine own inventions hope\r\nThings not reveal’d, which th’ invisible King,\r\nOnely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,\r\nTo none communicable in Earth or Heaven:\r\nAnough is left besides to search and know.\r\nBut Knowledge is as food, and needs no less\r\nHer Temperance over Appetite, to know\r\nIn measure what the mind may well contain,\r\nOppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns\r\nWisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.\r\n\r\nKnow then, that after _Lucifer_ from Heav’n\r\n(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host\r\nOf Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)\r\nFell with his flaming Legions through the Deep\r\nInto his place, and the great Son returnd\r\nVictorious with his Saints, th’ Omnipotent\r\nEternal Father from his Throne beheld\r\nThir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.\r\n\r\nAt least our envious Foe hath fail’d, who thought\r\nAll like himself rebellious, by whose aid\r\nThis inaccessible high strength, the seat\r\nOf Deitie supream, us dispossest,\r\nHe trusted to have seis’d, and into fraud\r\nDrew many, whom thir place knows here no more;\r\nYet farr the greater part have kept, I see,\r\nThir station, Heav’n yet populous retaines\r\nNumber sufficient to possess her Realmes\r\nThough wide, and this high Temple to frequent\r\nWith Ministeries due and solemn Rites:\r\nBut least his heart exalt him in the harme\r\nAlready done, to have dispeopl’d Heav’n,\r\nMy damage fondly deem’d, I can repaire\r\nThat detriment, if such it be to lose\r\nSelf-lost, and in a moment will create\r\nAnother World, out of one man a Race\r\nOf men innumerable, there to dwell,\r\nNot here, till by degrees of merit rais’d\r\nThey open to themselves at length the way\r\nUp hither, under long obedience tri’d,\r\nAnd Earth be chang’d to Heavn, & Heav’n to Earth,\r\nOne Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.\r\nMean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav’n,\r\nAnd thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee\r\nThis I perform, speak thou, and be it don:\r\nMy overshadowing Spirit and might with thee\r\nI send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep\r\nWithin appointed bounds be Heav’n and Earth,\r\nBoundless the Deep, because I am who fill\r\nInfinitude, nor vacuous the space.\r\nThough I uncircumscrib’d my self retire,\r\nAnd put not forth my goodness, which is free\r\nTo act or not, Necessitie and Chance\r\nApproach not mee, and what I will is Fate.\r\n\r\nSo spake th’ Almightie, and to what he spake\r\nHis Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.\r\nImmediate are the Acts of God, more swift\r\nThen time or motion, but to human ears\r\nCannot without process of speech be told,\r\nSo told as earthly notion can receave.\r\nGreat triumph and rejoycing was in Heav’n\r\nWhen such was heard declar’d the Almightie’s will;\r\nGlorie they sung to the most High, good will\r\nTo future men, and in thir dwellings peace:\r\nGlorie to him whose just avenging ire\r\nHad driven out th’ ungodly from his sight\r\nAnd th’ habitations of the just; to him\r\nGlorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain’d\r\nGood out of evil to create, in stead\r\nOf Spirits maligne a better Race to bring\r\nInto thir vacant room, and thence diffuse\r\nHis good to Worlds and Ages infinite.\r\nSo sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son\r\nOn his great Expedition now appeer’d,\r\nGirt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown’d\r\nOf Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love\r\nImmense, and all his Father in him shon.\r\nAbout his Chariot numberless were pour’d\r\nCherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,\r\nAnd Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing’d,\r\nFrom the Armoury of God, where stand of old\r\nMyriads between two brazen Mountains lodg’d\r\nAgainst a solemn day, harnest at hand,\r\nCelestial Equipage; and now came forth\r\nSpontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,\r\nAttendant on thir Lord: Heav’n op’nd wide\r\nHer ever during Gates, Harmonious sound\r\nOn golden Hinges moving, to let forth\r\nThe King of Glorie in his powerful Word\r\nAnd Spirit coming to create new Worlds.\r\nOn heav’nly ground they stood, and from the shore\r\nThey view’d the vast immeasurable Abyss\r\nOutrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,\r\nUp from the bottom turn’d by furious windes\r\nAnd surging waves, as Mountains to assault\r\nHeav’ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.\r\n\r\nSilence, ye troubl’d waves, and thou Deep, peace,\r\nSaid then th’ Omnific Word, your discord end:\r\n\r\nNor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim\r\nUplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode\r\nFarr into _Chaos_, and the World unborn;\r\nFor _Chaos_ heard his voice: him all his Traine\r\nFollow’d in bright procession to behold\r\nCreation, and the wonders of his might.\r\nThen staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand\r\nHe took the golden Compasses, prepar’d\r\nIn Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe\r\nThis Universe, and all created things:\r\nOne foot he center’d, and the other turn’d\r\nRound through the vast profunditie obscure,\r\nAnd said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,\r\nThis be thy just Circumference, O World.\r\nThus God the Heav’n created, thus the Earth,\r\nMatter unform’d and void: Darkness profound\r\nCover’d th’ Abyss: but on the watrie calme\r\nHis brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,\r\nAnd vital vertue infus’d, and vital warmth\r\nThroughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg’d\r\nThe black tartareous cold infernal dregs\r\nAdverse to life: then founded, then conglob’d\r\nLike things to like, the rest to several place\r\nDisparted, and between spun out the Air,\r\nAnd Earth self-ballanc’t on her Center hung.\r\n\r\nLet ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light\r\nEthereal, first of things, quintessence pure\r\nSprung from the Deep, and from her Native East\r\nTo journie through the airie gloom began,\r\nSphear’d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun\r\nWas not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle\r\nSojourn’d the while.  God saw the Light was good;\r\nAnd light from darkness by the Hemisphere\r\nDivided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night\r\nHe nam’d.  Thus was the first Day Eev’n and Morn:\r\nNor past uncelebrated, nor unsung\r\nBy the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light\r\nExhaling first from Darkness they beheld;\r\nBirth-day of Heav’n and Earth; with joy and shout\r\nThe hollow Universal Orb they fill’d,\r\nAnd touch’t thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais’d\r\nGod and his works, Creatour him they sung,\r\nBoth when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.\r\n\r\nAgain, God said, let ther be Firmament\r\nAmid the Waters, and let it divide\r\nThe Waters from the Waters: and God made\r\nThe Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,\r\nTransparent, Elemental Air, diffus’d\r\nIn circuit to the uttermost convex\r\nOf this great Round: partition firm and sure,\r\nThe Waters underneath from those above\r\nDividing: for as Earth, so hee the World\r\nBuilt on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide\r\nCrystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule\r\nOf _Chaos_ farr remov’d, least fierce extreames\r\nContiguous might distemper the whole frame:\r\nAnd Heav’n he nam’d the Firmament: So Eev’n\r\nAnd Morning _Chorus_ sung the second Day.\r\n\r\nThe Earth was form’d, but in the Womb as yet\r\nOf Waters, Embryon immature involv’d,\r\nAppeer’d not: over all the face of Earth\r\nMain Ocean flow’d, not idle, but with warme\r\nProlific humour soft’ning all her Globe,\r\nFermented the great Mother to conceave,\r\nSatiate with genial moisture, when God said\r\nBe gather’d now ye Waters under Heav’n\r\nInto one place, and let dry Land appeer.\r\nImmediately the Mountains huge appeer\r\nEmergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave\r\nInto the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:\r\nSo high as heav’d the tumid Hills, so low\r\nDown sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,\r\nCapacious bed of Waters: thither they\r\nHasted with glad precipitance, uprowld\r\nAs drops on dust conglobing from the drie;\r\nPart rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,\r\nFor haste; such flight the great command impress’d\r\nOn the swift flouds: as Armies at the call\r\nOf Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)\r\nTroop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,\r\nWave rowling after Wave, where way they found,\r\nIf steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,\r\nSoft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,\r\nBut they, or under ground, or circuit wide\r\nWith Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,\r\nAnd on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;\r\nEasie, e’re God had bid the ground be drie,\r\nAll but within those banks, where Rivers now\r\nStream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.\r\nThe dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle\r\nOf congregated Waters he call’d Seas:\r\nAnd saw that it was good, and said, Let th’ Earth\r\nPut forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,\r\nAnd Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;\r\nWhose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.\r\nHe scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then\r\nDesert and bare, unsightly, unadorn’d,\r\nBrought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad\r\nHer Universal Face with pleasant green,\r\nThen Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour’d\r\nOp’ning thir various colours, and made gay\r\nHer bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,\r\nForth flourish’t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept\r\nThe smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed\r\nEmbattell’d in her field: add the humble Shrub,\r\nAnd Bush with frizl’d hair implicit: last\r\nRose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred\r\nThir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm’d\r\nThir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,\r\nWith tufts the vallies & each fountain side,\r\nWith borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now\r\nSeemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,\r\nOr wander with delight, and love to haunt\r\nHer sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d\r\nUpon the Earth, and man to till the ground\r\nNone was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist\r\nWent up and waterd all the ground, and each\r\nPlant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth\r\nGod made, and every Herb, before it grew\r\nOn the green stemm; God saw that it was good:\r\nSo Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.\r\n\r\nAgain th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights\r\nHigh in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide\r\nThe Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,\r\nFor Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,\r\nAnd let them be for Lights as I ordaine\r\nThir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n\r\nTo give Light on the Earth; and it was so.\r\nAnd God made two great Lights, great for thir use\r\nTo Man, the greater to have rule by Day,\r\nThe less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,\r\nAnd set them in the Firmament of Heav’n\r\nTo illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day\r\nIn thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,\r\nAnd Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,\r\nSurveying his great Work, that it was good:\r\nFor of Celestial Bodies first the Sun\r\nA mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,\r\nThough of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon\r\nGlobose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,\r\nAnd sowd with Starrs the Heav’n thick as a field:\r\nOf Light by farr the greater part he took,\r\nTransplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac’d\r\nIn the Suns Orb, made porous to receive\r\nAnd drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine\r\nHer gather’d beams, great Palace now of Light.\r\nHither as to thir Fountain other Starrs\r\nRepairing, in thir gold’n Urns draw Light,\r\nAnd hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;\r\nBy tincture or reflection they augment\r\nThir small peculiar, though from human sight\r\nSo farr remote, with diminution seen.\r\nFirst in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,\r\nRegent of Day, and all th’ Horizon round\r\nInvested with bright Rayes, jocond to run\r\nHis Longitude through Heav’ns high rode: the gray\r\nDawn, and the _Pleiades_ before him danc’d\r\nShedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,\r\nBut opposite in leveld West was set\r\nHis mirror, with full face borrowing her Light\r\nFrom him, for other light she needed none\r\nIn that aspect, and still that distance keepes\r\nTill night, then in the East her turn she shines,\r\nRevolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign\r\nWith thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,\r\nWith thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d\r\nSpangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd\r\nWith thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,\r\nGlad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day.\r\n\r\nAnd God said, let the Waters generate\r\nReptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:\r\nAnd let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings\r\nDisplayd on the op’n Firmament of Heav’n.\r\nAnd God created the great Whales, and each\r\nSoul living, each that crept, which plenteously\r\nThe waters generated by thir kindes,\r\nAnd every Bird of wing after his kinde;\r\nAnd saw that it was good, and bless’d them, saying,\r\nBe fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas\r\nAnd Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;\r\nAnd let the Fowle be multiply’d on the Earth.\r\nForthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay\r\nWith Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales\r\nOf Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales\r\nGlide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft\r\nBank the mid Sea: part single or with mate\r\nGraze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves\r\nOf Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance\r\nShow to the Sun thir wav’d coats dropt with Gold,\r\nOr in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend\r\nMoist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food\r\nIn jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,\r\nAnd bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk\r\nWallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate\r\nTempest the Ocean: there Leviathan\r\nHugest of living Creatures, on the Deep\r\nStretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,\r\nAnd seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles\r\nDraws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.\r\nMean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares\r\nThir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon\r\nBursting with kindly rupture forth disclos’d\r\nThir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge\r\nThey summ’d thir Penns, and soaring th’ air sublime\r\nWith clang despis’d the ground, under a cloud\r\nIn prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork\r\nOn Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:\r\nPart loosly wing the Region, part more wise\r\nIn common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,\r\nIntelligent of seasons, and set forth\r\nThir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s\r\nFlying, and over Lands with mutual wing\r\nEasing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane\r\nHer annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire\r\nFloats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:\r\nFrom Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song\r\nSolac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings\r\nTill Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal\r\nCeas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:\r\nOthers on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d\r\nThir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck\r\nBetween her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes\r\nHer state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit\r\nThe Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre\r\nThe mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground\r\nWalk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds\r\nThe silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine\r\nAdorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue\r\nOf Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus\r\nWith Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,\r\nEv’ning and Morn solemniz’d the Fift day.\r\n\r\nThe Sixt, and of Creation last arose\r\nWith Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,\r\nLet th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,\r\nCattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,\r\nEach in their kinde.  The Earth obey’d, and strait\r\nOp’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth\r\nInnumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,\r\nLimb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose\r\nAs from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns\r\nIn Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;\r\nAmong the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:\r\nThe Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:\r\nThose rare and solitarie, these in flocks\r\nPasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:\r\nThe grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d\r\nThe Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free\r\nHis hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,\r\nAnd Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,\r\nThe Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale\r\nRising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw\r\nIn Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground\r\nBore up his branching head: scarse from his mould\r\n_Behemoth_ biggest born of Earth upheav’d\r\nHis vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,\r\nAs Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land\r\nThe River Horse and scalie Crocodile.\r\nAt once came forth whatever creeps the ground,\r\nInsect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans\r\nFor wings, and smallest Lineaments exact\r\nIn all the Liveries dect of Summers pride\r\nWith spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:\r\nThese as a line thir long dimension drew,\r\nStreaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all\r\nMinims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde\r\nWondrous in length and corpulence involv’d\r\nThir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept\r\nThe Parsimonious Emmet, provident\r\nOf future, in small room large heart enclos’d,\r\nPattern of just equalitie perhaps\r\nHereafter, join’d in her popular Tribes\r\nOf Commonaltie: swarming next appeer’d\r\nThe Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone\r\nDeliciously, and builds her waxen Cells\r\nWith Honey stor’d: the rest are numberless,\r\nAnd thou thir Natures know’st, and gav’st them Names,\r\nNeedlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown\r\nThe Serpent suttl’st Beast of all the field,\r\nOf huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes\r\nAnd hairie Main terrific, though to thee\r\nNot noxious, but obedient at thy call.\r\nNow Heav’n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld\r\nHer motions, as the great first-Movers hand\r\nFirst wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire\r\nConsummate lovly smil’d; Aire, Water, Earth,\r\nBy Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt\r\nFrequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain’d;\r\nThere wanted yet the Master work, the end\r\nOf all yet don; a Creature who not prone\r\nAnd Brute as other Creatures, but endu’d\r\nWith Sanctitie of Reason, might erect\r\nHis Stature, and upright with Front serene\r\nGovern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence\r\nMagnanimous to correspond with Heav’n,\r\nBut grateful to acknowledge whence his good\r\nDescends, thither with heart and voice and eyes\r\nDirected in Devotion, to adore\r\nAnd worship God Supream, who made him chief\r\nOf all his works: therefore the Omnipotent\r\nEternal Father (For where is not hee\r\nPresent) thus to his Son audibly spake.\r\n\r\nLet us make now Man in our image, Man\r\nIn our similitude, and let them rule\r\nOver the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,\r\nBeast of the Field, and over all the Earth,\r\nAnd every creeping thing that creeps the ground.\r\nThis said, he formd thee, _Adam_, thee O Man\r\nDust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath’d\r\nThe breath of Life; in his own Image hee\r\nCreated thee, in the Image of God\r\nExpress, and thou becam’st a living Soul.\r\nMale he created thee, but thy consort\r\nFemal for Race; then bless’d Mankinde, and said,\r\nBe fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,\r\nSubdue it, and throughout Dominion hold\r\nOver Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,\r\nAnd every living thing that moves on the Earth.\r\nWherever thus created, for no place\r\nIs yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know’st\r\nHe brought thee into this delicious Grove,\r\nThis Garden, planted with the Trees of God,\r\nDelectable both to behold and taste;\r\nAnd freely all thir pleasant fruit for food\r\nGave thee, all sorts are here that all th’ Earth yeelds,\r\nVarietie without end; but of the Tree\r\nWhich tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,\r\nThou mai’st not; in the day thou eat’st, thou di’st;\r\nDeath is the penaltie impos’d, beware,\r\nAnd govern well thy appetite, least sin\r\nSurprise thee, and her black attendant Death.\r\nHere finish’d hee, and all that he had made\r\nView’d, and behold all was entirely good;\r\nSo Ev’n and Morn accomplish’d the Sixt day:\r\nYet not till the Creator from his work\r\nDesisting, though unwearied, up returnd\r\nUp to the Heav’n of Heav’ns his high abode,\r\nThence to behold this new created World\r\nTh’ addition of his Empire, how it shew’d\r\nIn prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,\r\nAnswering his great Idea.  Up he rode\r\nFollowd with acclamation and the sound\r\nSymphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun’d\r\nAngelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire\r\nResounded, (thou remember’st, for thou heardst)\r\nThe Heav’ns and all the Constellations rung,\r\nThe Planets in thir stations list’ning stood,\r\nWhile the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.\r\nOpen, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,\r\nOpen, ye Heav’ns, your living dores; let in\r\nThe great Creator from his work returnd\r\nMagnificent, his Six days work, a World;\r\nOpen, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne\r\nTo visit oft the dwellings of just Men\r\nDelighted, and with frequent intercourse\r\nThither will send his winged Messengers\r\nOn errands of supernal Grace.  So sung\r\nThe glorious Train ascending: He through Heav’n,\r\nThat open’d wide her blazing Portals, led\r\nTo Gods Eternal house direct the way,\r\nA broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold\r\nAnd pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,\r\nSeen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way\r\nWhich nightly as a circling Zone thou seest\r\nPouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh\r\nEev’ning arose in _Eden_, for the Sun\r\nWas set, and twilight from the East came on,\r\nForerunning Night; when at the holy mount\r\nOf Heav’ns high-seated top, th’ Impereal Throne\r\nOf Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,\r\nThe Filial Power arriv’d, and sate him down\r\nWith his great Father (for he also went\r\nInvisible, yet staid (such priviledge\r\nHath Omnipresence) and the work ordain’d,\r\nAuthor and end of all things, and from work\r\nNow resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,\r\nAs resting on that day from all his work,\r\nBut not in silence holy kept; the Harp\r\nHad work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,\r\nAnd Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,\r\nAll sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire\r\nTemper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice\r\nChoral or Unison: of incense Clouds\r\nFuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.\r\nCreation and the Six dayes acts they sung,\r\nGreat are thy works, _Jehovah_, infinite\r\nThy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue\r\nRelate thee; greater now in thy return\r\nThen from the Giant Angels; thee that day\r\nThy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create\r\nIs greater then created to destroy.\r\nWho can impair thee, mighty King, or bound\r\nThy Empire? easily the proud attempt\r\nOf Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine\r\nThou hast repeld, while impiously they thought\r\nThee to diminish, and from thee withdraw\r\nThe number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes\r\nTo lessen thee, against his purpose serves\r\nTo manifest the more thy might: his evil\r\nThou usest, and from thence creat’st more good.\r\nWitness this new-made World, another Heav’n\r\nFrom Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view\r\nOn the cleer _Hyaline_, the Glassie Sea;\r\nOf amplitude almost immense, with Starr’s\r\nNumerous, and every Starr perhaps a World\r\nOf destind habitation; but thou know’st\r\nThir seasons: among these the seat of men,\r\nEarth with her nether Ocean circumfus’d,\r\nThir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,\r\nAnd sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc’t,\r\nCreated in his Image, there to dwell\r\nAnd worship him, and in reward to rule\r\nOver his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,\r\nAnd multiply a Race of Worshippers\r\nHoly and just: thrice happie if they know\r\nThir happiness, and persevere upright.\r\n\r\nSo sung they, and the Empyrean rung,\r\nWith _Halleluiahs_: Thus was Sabbath kept.\r\nAnd thy request think now fulfill’d, that ask’d\r\nHow first this World and face of things began,\r\nAnd what before thy memorie was don\r\nFrom the beginning, that posteritie\r\nInformd by thee might know; if else thou seekst\r\nAught, not surpassing human measure, say.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Adam_ gratefully repli’d.\r\nWhat thanks sufficient, or what recompence\r\nEqual have I to render thee, Divine\r\nHystorian, who thus largely hast allayd\r\nThe thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf’t\r\nThis friendly condescention to relate\r\nThings else by me unsearchable, now heard\r\nVVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,\r\nWith glorie attributed to the high\r\nCreator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,\r\nVVhich onely thy solution can resolve.\r\nVVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld\r\nOf Heav’n and Earth consisting, and compute,\r\nThir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,\r\nAn Atom, with the Firmament compar’d\r\nAnd all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle\r\nSpaces incomprehensible (for such\r\nThir distance argues and thir swift return\r\nDiurnal) meerly to officiate light\r\nRound this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,\r\nOne day and night; in all thir vast survey\r\nUseless besides, reasoning I oft admire,\r\nHow Nature wise and frugal could commit\r\nSuch disproportions, with superfluous hand\r\nSo many nobler Bodies to create,\r\nGreater so manifold to this one use,\r\nFor aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose\r\nSuch restless revolution day by day\r\nRepeated, while the sedentarie Earth,\r\nThat better might with farr less compass move,\r\nServ’d by more noble then her self, attaines\r\nHer end without least motion, and receaves,\r\nAs Tribute such a sumless journey brought\r\nOf incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;\r\nSpeed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.\r\n\r\nSo spake our Sire, and by his count’nance seemd\r\nEntring on studious thoughts abstruse, which _Eve_\r\nPerceaving where she sat retir’d in sight,\r\nWith lowliness Majestic from her seat,\r\nAnd Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,\r\nRose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,\r\nTo visit how they prosper’d, bud and bloom,\r\nHer Nurserie; they at her coming sprung\r\nAnd toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.\r\nYet went she not, as not with such discourse\r\nDelighted, or not capable her eare\r\nOf what was high: such pleasure she reserv’d,\r\n_Adam_ relating, she sole Auditress;\r\nHer Husband the Relater she preferr’d\r\nBefore the Angel, and of him to ask\r\nChose rather; hee, she knew would intermix\r\nGrateful digressions, and solve high dispute\r\nWith conjugal Caresses, from his Lip\r\nNot Words alone pleas’d her.  O when meet now\r\nSuch pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn’d?\r\nWith Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;\r\nNot unattended, for on her as Queen\r\nA pomp of winning Graces waited still,\r\nAnd from about her shot Darts of desire\r\nInto all Eyes to wish her still in sight.\r\nAnd _Raphael_ now to _Adam_’s doubt propos’d\r\nBenevolent and facil thus repli’d.\r\n\r\nTo ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav’n\r\nIs as the Book of God before thee set,\r\nWherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne\r\nHis Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:\r\nThis to attain, whether Heav’n move or Earth,\r\nImports not, if thou reck’n right, the rest\r\nFrom Man or Angel the great Architect\r\nDid wisely to conceal, and not divulge\r\nHis secrets to be scann’d by them who ought\r\nRather admire; or if they list to try\r\nConjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav’ns\r\nHath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move\r\nHis laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide\r\nHereafter, when they come to model Heav’n\r\nAnd calculate the Starrs, how they will weild\r\nThe mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive\r\nTo save appeerances, how gird the Sphear\r\nWith Centric and Eccentric scribl’d o’re,\r\nCycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:\r\nAlreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,\r\nWho art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest\r\nThat Bodies bright and greater should not serve\r\nThe less not bright, nor Heav’n such journies run,\r\nEarth sitting still, when she alone receaves\r\nThe benefit: consider first, that Great\r\nOr Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth\r\nThough, in comparison of Heav’n, so small,\r\nNor glistering, may of solid good containe\r\nMore plenty then the Sun that barren shines,\r\nWhose vertue on it self workes no effect,\r\nBut in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd\r\nHis beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.\r\nYet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries\r\nOfficious, but to thee Earths habitant.\r\nAnd for the Heav’ns wide Circuit, let it speak\r\nThe Makers high magnificence, who built\r\nSo spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;\r\nThat Man may know he dwells not in his own;\r\nAn Edifice too large for him to fill,\r\nLodg’d in a small partition, and the rest\r\nOrdain’d for uses to his Lord best known.\r\nThe swiftness of those Circles attribute,\r\nThough numberless, to his Omnipotence,\r\nThat to corporeal substances could adde\r\nSpeed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,\r\nWho since the Morning hour set out from Heav’n\r\nWhere God resides, and ere mid-day arriv’d\r\nIn _Eden_, distance inexpressible\r\nBy Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,\r\nAdmitting Motion in the Heav’ns, to shew\r\nInvalid that which thee to doubt it mov’d;\r\nNot that I so affirm, though so it seem\r\nTo thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.\r\nGod to remove his wayes from human sense,\r\nPlac’d Heav’n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,\r\nIf it presume, might erre in things too high,\r\nAnd no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun\r\nBe Center to the World, and other Starrs\r\nBy his attractive vertue and thir own\r\nIncited, dance about him various rounds?\r\nThir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,\r\nProgressive, retrograde, or standing still,\r\nIn six thou seest, and what if sev’nth to these\r\nThe Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,\r\nInsensibly three different Motions move?\r\nWhich else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,\r\nMov’d contrarie with thwart obliquities,\r\nOr save the Sun his labour, and that swift\r\nNocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos’d,\r\nInvisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele\r\nOf Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,\r\nIf Earth industrious of her self fetch Day\r\nTravelling East, and with her part averse\r\nFrom the Suns beam meet Night, her other part\r\nStill luminous by his ray.  What if that light\r\nSent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,\r\nTo the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr\r\nEnlightning her by Day, as she by Night\r\nThis Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,\r\nFeilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest\r\nAs Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce\r\nFruits in her soft’nd Soile, for some to eate\r\nAllotted there; and other Suns perhaps\r\nWith thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie\r\nCommunicating Male and Femal Light,\r\nWhich two great Sexes animate the World,\r\nStor’d in each Orb perhaps with some that live.\r\nFor such vast room in Nature unpossest\r\nBy living Soule, desert and desolate,\r\nOnely to shine, yet scarce to contribute\r\nEach Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr\r\nDown to this habitable, which returnes\r\nLight back to them, is obvious to dispute.\r\nBut whether thus these things, or whether not,\r\nWhether the Sun predominant in Heav’n\r\nRise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,\r\nHee from the East his flaming rode begin,\r\nOr Shee from West her silent course advance\r\nWith inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps\r\nOn her soft Axle, while she paces Eev’n,\r\nAnd bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,\r\nSollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,\r\nLeave them to God above, him serve and feare;\r\nOf other Creatures, as him pleases best,\r\nWherever plac’t, let him dispose: joy thou\r\nIn what he gives to thee, this Paradise\r\nAnd thy faire _Eve_; Heav’n is for thee too high\r\nTo know what passes there; be lowlie wise:\r\nThink onely what concernes thee and thy being;\r\nDream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there\r\nLive, in what state, condition or degree,\r\nContented that thus farr hath been reveal’d\r\nNot of Earth onely but of highest Heav’n.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Adam_ cleerd of doubt, repli’d.\r\nHow fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure\r\nIntelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,\r\nAnd freed from intricacies, taught to live,\r\nThe easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts\r\nTo interrupt the sweet of Life, from which\r\nGod hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,\r\nAnd not molest us, unless we our selves\r\nSeek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.\r\nBut apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave\r\nUncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;\r\nTill warn’d, or by experience taught, she learne,\r\nThat not to know at large of things remote\r\nFrom use, obscure and suttle, but to know\r\nThat which before us lies in daily life,\r\nIs the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,\r\nOr emptiness, or fond impertinence,\r\nAnd renders us in things that most concerne\r\nUnpractis’d, unprepar’d, and still to seek.\r\nTherefore from this high pitch let us descend\r\nA lower flight, and speak of things at hand\r\nUseful, whence haply mention may arise\r\nOf somthing not unseasonable to ask\r\nBy sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign’d.\r\nThee I have heard relating what was don\r\nEre my remembrance: now hear mee relate\r\nMy Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;\r\nAnd Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest\r\nHow suttly to detaine thee I devise,\r\nInviting thee to hear while I relate,\r\nFond, were it not in hope of thy reply:\r\nFor while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav’n,\r\nAnd sweeter thy discourse is to my eare\r\nThen Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst\r\nAnd hunger both, from labour, at the houre\r\nOf sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,\r\nThough pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine\r\nImbu’d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Raphael_ answer’d heav’nly meek.\r\nNor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,\r\nNor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee\r\nAbundantly his gifts hath also pour’d,\r\nInward and outward both, his image faire:\r\nSpeaking or mute all comliness and grace\r\nAttends thee, and each word, each motion formes.\r\nNor less think wee in Heav’n of thee on Earth\r\nThen of our fellow servant, and inquire\r\nGladly into the wayes of God with Man:\r\nFor God we see hath honour’d thee, and set\r\nOn Man his equal Love: say therefore on;\r\nFor I that Day was absent, as befell,\r\nBound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,\r\nFarr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;\r\nSquar’d in full Legion (such command we had)\r\nTo see that none thence issu’d forth a spie,\r\nOr enemie, while God was in his work,\r\nLeast hee incenst at such eruption bold,\r\nDestruction with Creation might have mixt.\r\nNot that they durst without his leave attempt,\r\nBut us he sends upon his high behests\r\nFor state, as Sovran King, and to enure\r\nOur prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut\r\nThe dismal Gates, and barricado’d strong;\r\nBut long ere our approaching heard within\r\nNoise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,\r\nTorment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.\r\nGlad we return’d up to the coasts of Light\r\nEre Sabbath Eev’ning: so we had in charge.\r\nBut thy relation now; for I attend,\r\nPleas’d with thy words no less then thou with mine.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.\r\nFor Man to tell how human Life began\r\nIs hard; for who himself beginning knew?\r\nDesire with thee still longer to converse\r\nInduc’d me.  As new wak’t from soundest sleep\r\nSoft on the flourie herb I found me laid\r\nIn Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun\r\nSoon dri’d, and on the reaking moisture fed.\r\nStrait toward Heav’n my wondring Eyes I turnd,\r\nAnd gaz’d a while the ample Skie, till rais’d\r\nBy quick instinctive motion up I sprung,\r\nAs thitherward endevoring, and upright\r\nStood on my feet; about me round I saw\r\nHill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,\r\nAnd liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,\r\nCreatures that livd, and movd, and walk’d, or flew,\r\nBirds on the branches warbling; all things smil’d,\r\nWith fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow’d.\r\nMy self I then perus’d, and Limb by Limb\r\nSurvey’d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran\r\nWith supple joints, as lively vigour led:\r\nBut who I was, or where, or from what cause,\r\nKnew not; to speak I tri’d, and forthwith spake,\r\nMy Tongue obey’d and readily could name\r\nWhat e’re I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,\r\nAnd thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,\r\nYe Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,\r\nAnd ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,\r\nTell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?\r\nNot of my self; by some great Maker then,\r\nIn goodness and in power praeeminent;\r\nTell me, how may I know him, how adore,\r\nFrom whom I have that thus I move and live,\r\nAnd feel that I am happier then I know.\r\nWhile thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,\r\nFrom where I first drew Aire, and first beheld\r\nThis happie Light, when answer none return’d,\r\nOn a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours\r\nPensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep\r\nFirst found me, and with soft oppression seis’d\r\nMy droused sense, untroubl’d, though I thought\r\nI then was passing to my former state\r\nInsensible, and forthwith to dissolve:\r\nWhen suddenly stood at my Head a dream,\r\nWhose inward apparition gently mov’d\r\nMy Fancy to believe I yet had being,\r\nAnd livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,\r\nAnd said, thy Mansion wants thee, _Adam_, rise,\r\nFirst Man, of Men innumerable ordain’d\r\nFirst Father, call’d by thee I come thy Guide\r\nTo the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar’d.\r\nSo saying, by the hand he took me rais’d,\r\nAnd over Fields and Waters, as in Aire\r\nSmooth sliding without step, last led me up\r\nA woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,\r\nA Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees\r\nPlanted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw\r\nOf Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree\r\nLoad’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye\r\nTempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite\r\nTo pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found\r\nBefore mine Eyes all real, as the dream\r\nHad lively shadowd: Here had new begun\r\nMy wandring, had not hee who was my Guide\r\nUp hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,\r\nPresence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw\r\nIn adoration at his feet I fell\r\nSubmiss: he rear’d me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,\r\nSaid mildely, Author of all this thou seest\r\nAbove, or round about thee or beneath.\r\nThis Paradise I give thee, count it thine\r\nTo Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:\r\nOf every Tree that in the Garden growes\r\nEate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:\r\nBut of the Tree whose operation brings\r\nKnowledg of good and ill, which I have set\r\nThe Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,\r\nAmid the Garden by the Tree of Life,\r\nRemember what I warne thee, shun to taste,\r\nAnd shun the bitter consequence: for know,\r\nThe day thou eat’st thereof, my sole command\r\nTransgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;\r\nFrom that day mortal, and this happie State\r\nShalt loose, expell’d from hence into a World\r\nOf woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc’d\r\nThe rigid interdiction, which resounds\r\nYet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice\r\nNot to incur; but soon his cleer aspect\r\nReturn’d and gratious purpose thus renew’d.\r\nNot onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth\r\nTo thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords\r\nPossess it, and all things that therein live,\r\nOr live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.\r\nIn signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold\r\nAfter thir kindes; I bring them to receave\r\nFrom thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie\r\nWith low subjection; understand the same\r\nOf Fish within thir watry residence,\r\nNot hither summond, since they cannot change\r\nThir Element to draw the thinner Aire.\r\nAs thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold\r\nApproaching two and two, These cowring low\r\nWith blandishment, each Bird stoop’d on his wing.\r\nI nam’d them, as they pass’d, and understood\r\nThir Nature, with such knowledg God endu’d\r\nMy sudden apprehension: but in these\r\nI found not what me thought I wanted still;\r\nAnd to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.\r\n\r\nO by what Name, for thou above all these,\r\nAbove mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,\r\nSurpassest farr my naming, how may I\r\nAdore thee, Author of this Universe,\r\nAnd all this good to man, for whose well being\r\nSo amply, and with hands so liberal\r\nThou hast provided all things: but with mee\r\nI see not who partakes.  In solitude\r\nWhat happiness, who can enjoy alone,\r\nOr all enjoying, what contentment find?\r\nThus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,\r\nAs with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.\r\n\r\nWhat call’st thou solitude, is not the Earth\r\nWith various living creatures, and the Aire\r\nReplenisht, and all these at thy command\r\nTo come and play before thee, know’st thou not\r\nThir language and thir wayes, they also know,\r\nAnd reason not contemptibly; with these\r\nFind pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.\r\nSo spake the Universal Lord, and seem’d\r\nSo ordering.  I with leave of speech implor’d,\r\nAnd humble deprecation thus repli’d.\r\n\r\nLet not my words offend thee, Heav’nly Power,\r\nMy Maker, be propitious while I speak.\r\nHast thou not made me here thy substitute,\r\nAnd these inferiour farr beneath me set?\r\nAmong unequals what societie\r\nCan sort, what harmonie or true delight?\r\nWhich must be mutual, in proportion due\r\nGiv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie\r\nThe one intense, the other still remiss\r\nCannot well suite with either, but soon prove\r\nTedious alike: Of fellowship I speak\r\nSuch as I seek, fit to participate\r\nAll rational delight, wherein the brute\r\nCannot be human consort; they rejoyce\r\nEach with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;\r\nSo fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;\r\nMuch less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle\r\nSo well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;\r\nWors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.\r\n\r\nWhereto th’ Almighty answer’d, not displeas’d.\r\nA nice and suttle happiness I see\r\nThou to thy self proposest, in the choice\r\nOf thy Associates, _Adam_, and wilt taste\r\nNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.\r\nWhat thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,\r\nSeem I to thee sufficiently possest\r\nOf happiness, or not? who am alone\r\nFrom all Eternitie, for none I know\r\nSecond to mee or like, equal much less.\r\nHow have I then with whom to hold converse\r\nSave with the Creatures which I made, and those\r\nTo me inferiour, infinite descents\r\nBeneath what other Creatures are to thee?\r\n\r\nHe ceas’d, I lowly answer’d.  To attaine\r\nThe highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes\r\nAll human thoughts come short, Supream of things;\r\nThou in thy self art perfet, and in thee\r\nIs no deficience found; not so is Man,\r\nBut in degree, the cause of his desire\r\nBy conversation with his like to help,\r\nOr solace his defects.  No need that thou\r\nShouldst propagat, already infinite;\r\nAnd through all numbers absolute, though One;\r\nBut Man by number is to manifest\r\nHis single imperfection, and beget\r\nLike of his like, his Image multipli’d,\r\nIn unitie defective, which requires\r\nCollateral love, and deerest amitie.\r\nThou in thy secresie although alone,\r\nBest with thy self accompanied, seek’st not\r\nSocial communication, yet so pleas’d,\r\nCanst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt\r\nOf Union or Communion, deifi’d;\r\nI by conversing cannot these erect\r\nFrom prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.\r\nThus I embold’nd spake, and freedom us’d\r\nPermissive, and acceptance found, which gain’d\r\nThis answer from the gratious voice Divine.\r\n\r\nThus farr to try thee, _Adam_, I was pleas’d,\r\nAnd finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,\r\nWhich thou hast rightly nam’d, but of thy self,\r\nExpressing well the spirit within thee free,\r\nMy Image, not imparted to the Brute,\r\nWhose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee\r\nGood reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,\r\nAnd be so minded still; I, ere thou spak’st,\r\nKnew it not good for Man to be alone,\r\nAnd no such companie as then thou saw’st\r\nIntended thee, for trial onely brought,\r\nTo see how thou could’st judge of fit and meet:\r\nWhat next I bring shall please thee, be assur’d,\r\nThy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,\r\nThy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.\r\n\r\nHee ended, or I heard no more, for now\r\nMy earthly by his Heav’nly overpowerd,\r\nWhich it had long stood under, streind to the highth\r\nIn that celestial Colloquie sublime,\r\nAs with an object that excels the sense,\r\nDazl’d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair\r\nOf sleep, which instantly fell on me, call’d\r\nBy Nature as in aide, and clos’d mine eyes.\r\nMine eyes he clos’d, but op’n left the Cell\r\nOf Fancie my internal sight, by which\r\nAbstract as in a transe methought I saw,\r\nThough sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape\r\nStill glorious before whom awake I stood;\r\nWho stooping op’nd my left side, and took\r\nFrom thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,\r\nAnd Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,\r\nBut suddenly with flesh fill’d up & heal’d:\r\nThe Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;\r\nUnder his forming hands a Creature grew,\r\nManlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,\r\nThat what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now\r\nMean, or in her summd up, in her containd\r\nAnd in her looks, which from that time infus’d\r\nSweetness into my heart, unfelt before,\r\nAnd into all things from her Aire inspir’d\r\nThe spirit of love and amorous delight.\r\nShe disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak’d\r\nTo find her, or for ever to deplore\r\nHer loss, and other pleasures all abjure:\r\nWhen out of hope, behold her, not farr off,\r\nSuch as I saw her in my dream, adornd\r\nWith what all Earth or Heaven could bestow\r\nTo make her amiable: On she came,\r\nLed by her Heav’nly Maker, though unseen,\r\nAnd guided by his voice, nor uninformd\r\nOf nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:\r\nGrace was in all her steps, Heav’n in her Eye,\r\nIn every gesture dignitie and love.\r\nI overjoyd could not forbear aloud.\r\n\r\nThis turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill’d\r\nThy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,\r\nGiver of all things faire, but fairest this\r\nOf all thy gifts, nor enviest.  I now see\r\nBone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self\r\nBefore me; Woman is her Name, of Man\r\nExtracted; for this cause he shall forgoe\r\nFather and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;\r\nAnd they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.\r\n\r\nShe heard me thus, and though divinely brought,\r\nYet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,\r\nHer vertue and the conscience of her worth,\r\nThat would be woo’d, and not unsought be won,\r\nNot obvious, not obtrusive, but retir’d,\r\nThe more desirable, or to say all,\r\nNature her self, though pure of sinful thought,\r\nWrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn’d;\r\nI follow’d her, she what was Honour knew,\r\nAnd with obsequious Majestie approv’d\r\nMy pleaded reason.  To the Nuptial Bowre\r\nI led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav’n,\r\nAnd happie Constellations on that houre\r\nShed thir selectest influence; the Earth\r\nGave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;\r\nJoyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires\r\nWhisper’d it to the Woods, and from thir wings\r\nFlung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,\r\nDisporting, till the amorous Bird of Night\r\nSung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr\r\nOn his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.\r\nThus I have told thee all my State, and brought\r\nMy Storie to the sum of earthly bliss\r\nWhich I enjoy, and must confess to find\r\nIn all things else delight indeed, but such\r\nAs us’d or not, works in the mind no change,\r\nNor vehement desire, these delicacies\r\nI mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours,\r\nWalks, and the melodie of Birds; but here\r\nFarr otherwise, transported I behold,\r\nTransported touch; here passion first I felt,\r\nCommotion strange, in all enjoyments else\r\nSuperiour and unmov’d, here onely weake\r\nAgainst the charm of Beauties powerful glance.\r\nOr Nature faild in mee, and left some part\r\nNot proof enough such Object to sustain,\r\nOr from my side subducting, took perhaps\r\nMore then enough; at least on her bestow’d\r\nToo much of Ornament, in outward shew\r\nElaborate, of inward less exact.\r\nFor well I understand in the prime end\r\nOf Nature her th’ inferiour, in the mind\r\nAnd inward Faculties, which most excell,\r\nIn outward also her resembling less\r\nHis Image who made both, and less expressing\r\nThe character of that Dominion giv’n\r\nO’re other Creatures; yet when I approach\r\nHer loveliness, so absolute she seems\r\nAnd in her self compleat, so well to know\r\nHer own, that what she wills to do or say,\r\nSeems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;\r\nAll higher knowledge in her presence falls\r\nDegraded, Wisdom in discourse with her\r\nLooses discount’nanc’t, and like folly shewes;\r\nAuthoritie and Reason on her waite,\r\nAs one intended first, not after made\r\nOccasionally; and to consummate all,\r\nGreatness of mind and nobleness thir seat\r\nBuild in her loveliest, and create an awe\r\nAbout her, as a guard Angelic plac’t.\r\nTo whom the Angel with contracted brow.\r\n\r\nAccuse not Nature, she hath don her part;\r\nDo thou but thine, and be not diffident\r\nOf Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou\r\nDismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,\r\nBy attributing overmuch to things\r\nLess excellent, as thou thy self perceav’st.\r\nFor what admir’st thou, what transports thee so,\r\nAn outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well\r\nThy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,\r\nNot thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;\r\nThen value: Oft times nothing profits more\r\nThen self-esteem, grounded on just and right\r\nWell manag’d; of that skill the more thou know’st,\r\nThe more she will acknowledge thee her Head,\r\nAnd to realities yeild all her shows;\r\nMade so adorn for thy delight the more,\r\nSo awful, that with honour thou maist love\r\nThy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.\r\nBut if the sense of touch whereby mankind\r\nIs propagated seem such dear delight\r\nBeyond all other, think the same voutsaf’t\r\nTo Cattel and each Beast; which would not be\r\nTo them made common & divulg’d, if aught\r\nTherein enjoy’d were worthy to subdue\r\nThe Soule of Man, or passion in him move.\r\nWhat higher in her societie thou findst\r\nAttractive, human, rational, love still;\r\nIn loving thou dost well, in passion not,\r\nWherein true Love consists not; love refines\r\nThe thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat\r\nIn Reason, and is judicious, is the scale\r\nBy which to heav’nly Love thou maist ascend,\r\nNot sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause\r\nAmong the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus half abash’t _Adam_ repli’d.\r\nNeither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught\r\nIn procreation common to all kindes\r\n(Though higher of the genial Bed by far,\r\nAnd with mysterious reverence I deem)\r\nSo much delights me, as those graceful acts,\r\nThose thousand decencies that daily flow\r\nFrom all her words and actions, mixt with Love\r\nAnd sweet compliance, which declare unfeign’d\r\nUnion of Mind, or in us both one Soule;\r\nHarmonie to behold in wedded pair\r\nMore grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.\r\nYet these subject not; I to thee disclose\r\nWhat inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,\r\nWho meet with various objects, from the sense\r\nVariously representing; yet still free\r\nApprove the best, and follow what I approve.\r\nTo love thou blam’st me not, for love thou saist\r\nLeads up to Heav’n, is both the way and guide;\r\nBear with me then, if lawful what I ask;\r\nLove not the heav’nly Spirits, and how thir Love\r\nExpress they, by looks onely, or do they mix\r\nIrradiance, virtual or immediate touch?\r\n\r\nTo whom the Angel with a smile that glow’d\r\nCelestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,\r\nAnswer’d.  Let it suffice thee that thou know’st\r\nUs happie, and without Love no happiness.\r\nWhatever pure thou in the body enjoy’st\r\n(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy\r\nIn eminence, and obstacle find none\r\nOf membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:\r\nEasier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,\r\nTotal they mix, Union of Pure with Pure\r\nDesiring; nor restrain’d conveyance need\r\nAs Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.\r\nBut I can now no more; the parting Sun\r\nBeyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles\r\n_Hesperean_ sets, my Signal to depart.\r\nBe strong, live happie, and love, but first of all\r\nHim whom to love is to obey, and keep\r\nHis great command; take heed least Passion sway\r\nThy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will\r\nWould not admit; thine and of all thy Sons\r\nThe weal or woe in thee is plac’t; beware.\r\nI in thy persevering shall rejoyce,\r\nAnd all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall\r\nFree in thine own Arbitrement it lies.\r\nPerfet within, no outward aid require;\r\nAnd all temptation to transgress repel.\r\n\r\nSo saying, he arose; whom _Adam_ thus\r\nFollow’d with benediction.  Since to part,\r\nGo heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,\r\nSent from whose sovran goodness I adore.\r\nGentle to me and affable hath been\r\nThy condescension, and shall be honour’d ever\r\nWith grateful Memorie: thou to mankind\r\nBe good and friendly still, and oft return.\r\n\r\nSo parted they, the Angel up to Heav’n\r\nFrom the thick shade, and _Adam_ to his Bowre.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nNo more of talk where God or Angel Guest\r\nWith Man, as with his Friend, familiar us’d\r\nTo sit indulgent, and with him partake\r\nRural repast, permitting him the while\r\nVenial discourse unblam’d: I now must change\r\nThose Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach\r\nDisloyal on the part of Man, revolt\r\nAnd disobedience: On the part of Heav’n\r\nNow alienated, distance and distaste,\r\nAnger and just rebuke, and judgement giv’n,\r\nThat brought into this World a world of woe,\r\nSinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie\r\nDeaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument\r\nNot less but more Heroic then the wrauth\r\nOf stern _Achilles_ on his Foe pursu’d\r\nThrice Fugitive about _Troy_ Wall; or rage\r\nOf _Turnus_ for _Lavinia_ disespous’d,\r\nOr _Neptun’s_ ire or _Juno’s_, that so long\r\nPerplex’d the _Greek_ and _Cytherea’s_ Son;\r\nIf answerable style I can obtaine\r\nOf my Celestial Patroness, who deignes\r\nHer nightly visitation unimplor’d,\r\nAnd dictates to me slumbring, or inspires\r\nEasie my unpremeditated Verse:\r\nSince first this subject for Heroic Song\r\nPleas’d me long choosing, and beginning late;\r\nNot sedulous by Nature to indite\r\nWarrs, hitherto the onely Argument\r\nHeroic deem’d, chief maistrie to dissect\r\nWith long and tedious havoc fabl’d Knights\r\nIn Battels feign’d; the better fortitude\r\nOf Patience and Heroic Martyrdom\r\nUnsung; or to describe Races and Games,\r\nOr tilting Furniture, emblazon’d Shields,\r\nImpreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;\r\nBases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights\r\nAt Joust and Torneament; then marshal’d Feast\r\nServ’d up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;\r\nThe skill of Artifice or Office mean,\r\nNot that which justly gives Heroic name\r\nTo Person or to Poem.  Mee of these\r\nNor skilld nor studious, higher Argument\r\nRemaines, sufficient of it self to raise\r\nThat name, unless an age too late, or cold\r\nClimat, or Years damp my intended wing\r\nDeprest, and much they may, if all be mine,\r\nNot Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.\r\n\r\nThe Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr\r\nOf _Hesperus_, whose Office is to bring\r\nTwilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter\r\nTwixt Day and Night, and now from end to end\r\nNights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:\r\nWhen _Satan_ who late fled before the threats\r\nOf _Gabriel_ out of _Eden_, now improv’d\r\nIn meditated fraud and malice, bent\r\nOn mans destruction, maugre what might hap\r\nOf heavier on himself, fearless return’d.\r\nBy Night he fled, and at Midnight return’d\r\nFrom compassing the Earth, cautious of day,\r\nSince _Uriel_ Regent of the Sun descri’d\r\nHis entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim\r\nThat kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv’n,\r\nThe space of seven continu’d Nights he rode\r\nWith darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line\r\nHe circl’d, four times cross’d the Carr of Night\r\nFrom Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;\r\nOn the eighth return’d, and on the Coast averse\r\nFrom entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth\r\nFound unsuspected way.  There was a place,\r\nNow not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\r\nWhere _Tigris_ at the foot of Paradise\r\nInto a Gulf shot under ground, till part\r\nRose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\r\nIn with the River sunk, and with it rose\r\nSatan involv’d in rising Mist, then sought\r\nWhere to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\r\nFrom _Eden_ over _Pontus_, and the Poole\r\n_Maeotis_, up beyond the River _Ob_;\r\nDownward as farr Antartic; and in length\r\nWest from _Orantes_ to the Ocean barr’d\r\nAt _Darien_, thence to the Land where flowes\r\n_Ganges_ and _Indus:_ thus the Orb he roam’d\r\nWith narrow search; and with inspection deep\r\nConsider’d every Creature, which of all\r\nMost opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\r\nThe Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\r\nHim after long debate, irresolute\r\nOf thoughts revolv’d, his final sentence chose\r\nFit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\r\nTo enter, and his dark suggestions hide\r\nFrom sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\r\nWhatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\r\nAs from his wit and native suttletie\r\nProceeding, which in other Beasts observ’d\r\nDoubt might beget of Diabolic pow’r\r\nActive within beyond the sense of brute.\r\nThus he resolv’d, but first from inward griefe\r\nHis bursting passion into plaints thus pour’d:\r\n\r\nO Earth, how like to Heav’n, if not preferrd\r\nMore justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\r\nWith second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\nFor what God after better worse would build?\r\nTerrestrial Heav’n, danc’t round by other Heav’ns\r\nThat shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\r\nLight above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\nIn thee concentring all thir precious beams\r\nOf sacred influence: As God in Heav’n\r\nIs Center, yet extends to all, so thou\r\nCentring receav’st from all those Orbs; in thee,\r\nNot in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\r\nProductive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\r\nOf Creatures animate with gradual life\r\nOf Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ’d up in Man.\r\nWith what delight could I have walkt thee round\r\nIf I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\r\nOf Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\r\nNow Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\r\nRocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\r\nFind place or refuge; and the more I see\r\nPleasures about me, so much more I feel\r\nTorment within me, as from the hateful siege\r\nOf contraries; all good to me becomes\r\nBane, and in Heav’n much worse would be my state.\r\nBut neither here seek I, no nor in Heav’n\r\nTo dwell, unless by maistring Heav’ns Supreame;\r\nNor hope to be my self less miserable\r\nBy what I seek, but others to make such\r\nAs I though thereby worse to me redound:\r\nFor onely in destroying I finde ease\r\nTo my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\r\nOr won to what may work his utter loss,\r\nFor whom all this was made, all this will soon\r\nFollow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\r\nIn wo then; that destruction wide may range:\r\nTo mee shall be the glorie sole among\r\nThe infernal Powers, in one day to have marr’d\r\nWhat he _Almightie_ styl’d, six Nights and Days\r\nContinu’d making, and who knows how long\r\nBefore had bin contriving, though perhaps\r\nNot longer then since I in one Night freed\r\nFrom servitude inglorious welnigh half\r\nTh’ Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\r\nOf his adorers: hee to be aveng’d,\r\nAnd to repaire his numbers thus impair’d,\r\nWhether such vertue spent of old now faild\r\nMore Angels to Create, if they at least\r\nAre his Created or to spite us more,\r\nDetermin’d to advance into our room\r\nA Creature form’d of Earth, and him endow,\r\nExalted from so base original,\r\nWith Heav’nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\r\nHe effected; Man he made, and for him built\r\nMagnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\r\nHim Lord pronounc’d, and, O indignitie!\r\nSubjected to his service Angel wings,\r\nAnd flaming Ministers to watch and tend\r\nThir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\r\nI dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\r\nOf midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\r\nIn every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\r\nThe Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\r\nTo hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\r\nO foul descent! that I who erst contended\r\nWith Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\r\nInto a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\r\nThis essence to incarnate and imbrute,\r\nThat to the hight of Deitie aspir’d;\r\nBut what will not Ambition and Revenge\r\nDescend to? who aspires must down as low\r\nAs high he soard, obnoxious first or last\r\nTo basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\r\nBitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\r\nLet it; I reck not, so it light well aim’d,\r\nSince higher I fall short, on him who next\r\nProvokes my envie, this new Favorite\r\nOf Heav’n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\r\nWhom us the more to spite his Maker rais’d\r\nFrom dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\r\n\r\nSo saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\r\nLike a black mist low creeping, he held on\r\nHis midnight search, where soonest he might finde\r\nThe Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\r\nIn Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl’d,\r\nHis head the midst, well stor’d with suttle wiles:\r\nNot yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\r\nNot nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\r\nFearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\r\nThe Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\r\nIn heart or head, possessing soon inspir’d\r\nWith act intelligential; but his sleep\r\nDisturbd not, waiting close th’ approach of Morn.\r\nNow whenas sacred Light began to dawne\r\nIn _Eden_ on the humid Flours, that breathd\r\nThir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\r\nFrom th’ Earths great Altar send up silent praise\r\nTo the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\r\nWith gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\r\nAnd joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\r\nOf Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\r\nThe season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\r\nThen commune how that day they best may ply\r\nThir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\r\nThe hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\r\nAnd _Eve_ first to her Husband thus began.\r\n\r\n_Adam_, well may we labour still to dress\r\nThis Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\r\nOur pleasant task enjoyn’d, but till more hands\r\nAid us, the work under our labour grows,\r\nLuxurious by restraint; what we by day\r\nLop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\r\nOne night or two with wanton growth derides\r\nTending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\r\nOr hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\r\nLet us divide our labours, thou where choice\r\nLeads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\r\nThe Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\r\nThe clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\r\nIn yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\r\nWith Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\r\nFor while so near each other thus all day\r\nOur task we choose, what wonder if no near\r\nLooks intervene and smiles, or object new\r\nCasual discourse draw on, which intermits\r\nOur dayes work brought to little, though begun\r\nEarly, and th’ hour of Supper comes unearn’d.\r\n\r\nTo whom mild answer _Adam_ thus return’d.\r\nSole _Eve_, Associate sole, to me beyond\r\nCompare above all living Creatures deare,\r\nWell hast thou motion’d, wel thy thoughts imployd\r\nHow we might best fulfill the work which here\r\nGod hath assign’d us, nor of me shalt pass\r\nUnprais’d: for nothing lovelier can be found\r\nIn woman, then to studie houshold good,\r\nAnd good workes in her Husband to promote.\r\nYet not so strictly hath our Lord impos’d\r\nLabour, as to debarr us when we need\r\nRefreshment, whether food, or talk between,\r\nFood of the mind, or this sweet intercourse\r\nOf looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,\r\nTo brute deni’d, and are of Love the food,\r\nLove not the lowest end of human life.\r\nFor not to irksom toile, but to delight\r\nHe made us, and delight to Reason joyn’d.\r\nThese paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt\r\nWill keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide\r\nAs we need walk, till younger hands ere long\r\nAssist us: But if much converse perhaps\r\nThee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.\r\nFor solitude somtimes is best societie,\r\nAnd short retirement urges sweet returne.\r\nBut other doubt possesses me, least harm\r\nBefall thee sever’d from me; for thou knowst\r\nWhat hath bin warn’d us, what malicious Foe\r\nEnvying our happiness, and of his own\r\nDespairing, seeks to work us woe and shame\r\nBy sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand\r\nWatches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find\r\nHis wish and best advantage, us asunder,\r\nHopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each\r\nTo other speedie aide might lend at need;\r\nWhether his first design be to withdraw\r\nOur fealtie from God, or to disturb\r\nConjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss\r\nEnjoy’d by us excites his envie more;\r\nOr this, or worse, leave not the faithful side\r\nThat gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.\r\nThe Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\r\nSafest and seemliest by her Husband staies,\r\nWho guards her, or with her the worst endures.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Virgin Majestie of _Eve_,\r\nAs one who loves, and some unkindness meets,\r\nWith sweet austeer composure thus reply’d.\r\n\r\nOfspring of Heav’n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,\r\nThat such an enemie we have, who seeks\r\nOur ruin, both by thee informd I learne,\r\nAnd from the parting Angel over-heard\r\nAs in a shadie nook I stood behind,\r\nJust then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.\r\nBut that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt\r\nTo God or thee, because we have a foe\r\nMay tempt it, I expected not to hear.\r\nHis violence thou fearst not, being such,\r\nAs wee, not capable of death or paine,\r\nCan either not receave, or can repell.\r\nHis fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs\r\nThy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love\r\nCan by his fraud be shak’n or seduc’t;\r\nThoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,\r\n_Adam_, misthought of her to thee so dear?\r\n\r\nTo whom with healing words _Adam_ reply’d.\r\nDaughter of God and Man, immortal _Eve_,\r\nFor such thou art, from sin and blame entire:\r\nNot diffident of thee do I dissuade\r\nThy absence from my sight, but to avoid\r\nTh’ attempt it self, intended by our Foe.\r\nFor hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses\r\nThe tempted with dishonour foul, suppos’d\r\nNot incorruptible of Faith, not prooff\r\nAgainst temptation: thou thy self with scorne\r\nAnd anger wouldst resent the offer’d wrong,\r\nThough ineffectual found: misdeem not then,\r\nIf such affront I labour to avert\r\nFrom thee alone, which on us both at once\r\nThe Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,\r\nOr daring, first on mee th’ assault shall light.\r\nNor thou his malice and false guile contemn;\r\nSuttle he needs must be, who could seduce\r\nAngels, nor think superfluous others aid.\r\nI from the influence of thy looks receave\r\nAccess in every Vertue, in thy sight\r\nMore wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were\r\nOf outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,\r\nShame to be overcome or over-reacht\r\nWould utmost vigor raise, and rais’d unite.\r\nWhy shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel\r\nWhen I am present, and thy trial choose\r\nWith me, best witness of thy Vertue tri’d.\r\n\r\nSo spake domestick _Adam_ in his care\r\nAnd Matrimonial Love, but _Eve_, who thought\r\nLess attributed to her Faith sincere,\r\nThus her reply with accent sweet renewd.\r\n\r\nIf this be our condition, thus to dwell\r\nIn narrow circuit strait’nd by a Foe,\r\nSuttle or violent, we not endu’d\r\nSingle with like defence, wherever met,\r\nHow are we happie, still in fear of harm?\r\nBut harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe\r\nTempting affronts us with his foul esteem\r\nOf our integritie: his foul esteeme\r\nSticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns\r\nFoul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard\r\nBy us? who rather double honour gaine\r\nFrom his surmise prov’d false, finde peace within,\r\nFavour from Heav’n, our witness from th’ event.\r\nAnd what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid\r\nAlone, without exterior help sustaind?\r\nLet us not then suspect our happie State\r\nLeft so imperfet by the Maker wise,\r\nAs not secure to single or combin’d.\r\nFraile is our happiness, if this be so,\r\nAnd _Eden_ were no _Eden_ thus expos’d.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Adam_ fervently repli’d.\r\nO Woman, best are all things as the will\r\nOf God ordaind them, his creating hand\r\nNothing imperfet or deficient left\r\nOf all that he Created, much less Man,\r\nOr ought that might his happie State secure,\r\nSecure from outward force; within himself\r\nThe danger lies, yet lies within his power:\r\nAgainst his will he can receave no harme.\r\nBut God left free the Will, for what obeyes\r\nReason, is free, and Reason he made right,\r\nBut bid her well beware, and still erect,\r\nLeast by some faire appeering good surpris’d\r\nShe dictate false, and missinforme the Will\r\nTo do what God expresly hath forbid.\r\nNot then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,\r\nThat I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.\r\nFirm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,\r\nSince Reason not impossibly may meet\r\nSome specious object by the Foe subornd,\r\nAnd fall into deception unaware,\r\nNot keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.\r\nSeek not temptation then, which to avoide\r\nWere better, and most likelie if from mee\r\nThou sever not; Trial will come unsought.\r\nWouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve\r\nFirst thy obedience; th’ other who can know,\r\nNot seeing thee attempted, who attest?\r\nBut if thou think, trial unsought may finde\r\nUs both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,\r\nGo; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;\r\nGo in thy native innocence, relie\r\nOn what thou hast of vertue, summon all,\r\nFor God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but _Eve_\r\nPersisted, yet submiss, though last, repli’d.\r\n\r\nWith thy permission then, and thus forewarnd\r\nChiefly by what thy own last reasoning words\r\nTouchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,\r\nMay finde us both perhaps farr less prepar’d,\r\nThe willinger I goe, nor much expect\r\nA Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;\r\nSo bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.\r\nThus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand\r\nSoft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light\r\n_Oread_ or _Dryad_, or of _Delia’s_ Traine,\r\nBetook her to the Groves, but _Delia’s_ self\r\nIn gate surpass’d and Goddess-like deport,\r\nThough not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,\r\nBut with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,\r\nGuiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,\r\nTo _Pales_, or _Pomona_, thus adornd,\r\nLikest she seemd, _Pomona_ when she fled\r\n_Vertumnus_, or to _Ceres_ in her Prime,\r\nYet Virgin of _Proserpina_ from _Jove_.\r\nHer long with ardent look his _Eye_ pursu’d\r\nDelighted, but desiring more her stay.\r\nOft he to her his charge of quick returne,\r\nRepeated, shee to him as oft engag’d\r\nTo be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,\r\nAnd all things in best order to invite\r\nNoontide repast, or Afternoons repose.\r\nO much deceav’d, much failing, hapless _Eve_,\r\nOf thy presum’d return! event perverse!\r\nThou never from that houre in Paradise\r\nFoundst either sweet repast, or found repose;\r\nSuch ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades\r\nWaited with hellish rancor imminent\r\nTo intercept thy way, or send thee back\r\nDespoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.\r\nFor now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,\r\nMeer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,\r\nAnd on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde\r\nThe onely two of Mankinde, but in them\r\nThe whole included Race, his purposd prey.\r\nIn Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft\r\nOf Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,\r\nThir tendance or Plantation for delight,\r\nBy Fountain or by shadie Rivulet\r\nHe sought them both, but wish’d his hap might find\r\n_Eve_ separate, he wish’d, but not with hope\r\nOf what so seldom chanc’d, when to his wish,\r\nBeyond his hope, _Eve_ separate he spies,\r\nVeild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,\r\nHalf spi’d, so thick the Roses bushing round\r\nAbout her glowd, oft stooping to support\r\nEach Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay\r\nCarnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,\r\nHung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies\r\nGently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,\r\nHer self, though fairest unsupported Flour,\r\nFrom her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.\r\nNeererhe drew, and many a walk travers’d\r\nOf stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,\r\nThen voluble and bold, now hid, now seen\r\nAmong thick-wov’n Arborets and Flours\r\nImborderd on each Bank, the hand of _Eve_:\r\nSpot more delicious then those Gardens feign’d\r\nOr of reviv’d _Adonis_, or renownd\r\n_Alcinous_, host of old _Laertes_ Son,\r\nOr that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King\r\nHeld dalliance with his faire _Egyptian_ Spouse.\r\nMuch hee the Place admir’d, the Person more.\r\nAs one who long in populous City pent,\r\nWhere Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,\r\nForth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe\r\nAmong the pleasant Villages and Farmes\r\nAdjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,\r\nThe smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,\r\nOr Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;\r\nIf chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,\r\nWhat pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,\r\nShe most, and in her look summs all Delight.\r\nSuch Pleasure took the Serpent to behold\r\nThis Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of _Eve_\r\nThus earlie, thus alone; her Heav’nly forme\r\nAngelic, but more soft, and Feminine,\r\nHer graceful Innocence, her every Aire\r\nOf gesture or lest action overawd\r\nHis Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav’d\r\nHis fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:\r\nThat space the Evil one abstracted stood\r\nFrom his own evil, and for the time remaind\r\nStupidly good, of enmitie disarm’d,\r\nOf guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;\r\nBut the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,\r\nThough in mid Heav’n, soon ended his delight,\r\nAnd tortures him now more, the more he sees\r\nOf pleasure not for him ordain’d: then soon\r\nFierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts\r\nOf mischief, gratulating, thus excites.\r\n\r\nThoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet\r\nCompulsion thus transported to forget\r\nWhat hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope\r\nOf Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste\r\nOf pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,\r\nSave what is in destroying, other joy\r\nTo me is lost.  Then let me not let pass\r\nOccasion which now smiles, behold alone\r\nThe Woman, opportune to all attempts,\r\nHer Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,\r\nWhose higher intellectual more I shun,\r\nAnd strength, of courage hautie, and of limb\r\nHeroic built, though of terrestrial mould,\r\nFoe not informidable, exempt from wound,\r\nI not; so much hath Hell debas’d, and paine\r\nInfeebl’d me, to what I was in Heav’n.\r\nShee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,\r\nNot terrible, though terrour be in Love\r\nAnd beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,\r\nHate stronger, under shew of Love well feign’d,\r\nThe way which to her ruin now I tend.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos’d\r\nIn Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward _Eve_\r\nAddress’d his way, not with indented wave,\r\nProne on the ground, as since, but on his reare,\r\nCircular base of rising foulds, that tour’d\r\nFould above fould a surging Maze, his Head\r\nCrested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;\r\nWith burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect\r\nAmidst his circling Spires, that on the grass\r\nFloted redundant: pleasing was his shape,\r\nAnd lovely, never since of Serpent kind\r\nLovelier, not those that in _Illyria_ chang’d\r\n_Hermione_ and _Cadmus_, or the God\r\nIn _Epidaurus_; nor to which transformd\r\n_Ammonian Jove_, or _Capitoline_ was seen,\r\nHee with _Olympias_, this with her who bore\r\n_Scipio_ the highth of _Rome_.  With tract oblique\r\nAt first, as one who sought access, but feard\r\nTo interrupt, side-long he works his way.\r\nAs when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought\r\nNigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind\r\nVeres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;\r\nSo varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine\r\nCurld many a wanton wreath in sight of _Eve_,\r\nTo lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound\r\nOf rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us’d\r\nTo such disport before her through the Field,\r\nFrom every Beast, more duteous at her call,\r\nThen at _Circean_ call the Herd disguis’d.\r\nHee boulder now, uncall’d before her stood;\r\nBut as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd\r\nHis turret Crest, and sleek enamel’d Neck,\r\nFawning, and lick’d the ground whereon she trod.\r\nHis gentle dumb expression turnd at length\r\nThe Eye of _Eve_ to mark his play; he glad\r\nOf her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue\r\nOrganic, or impulse of vocal Air,\r\nHis fraudulent temptation thus began.\r\n\r\nWonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps\r\nThou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm\r\nThy looks, the Heav’n of mildness, with disdain,\r\nDispleas’d that I approach thee thus, and gaze\r\nInsatiate, I thus single; nor have feard\r\nThy awful brow, more awful thus retir’d.\r\nFairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,\r\nThee all living things gaze on, all things thine\r\nBy gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore\r\nWith ravishment beheld, there best beheld\r\nWhere universally admir’d; but here\r\nIn this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,\r\nBeholders rude, and shallow to discerne\r\nHalf what in thee is fair, one man except,\r\nWho sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen\r\nA Goddess among Gods, ador’d and serv’d\r\nBy Angels numberless, thy daily Train.\r\n\r\nSo gloz’d the Tempter, and his Proem tun’d;\r\nInto the Heart of _Eve_ his words made way,\r\nThough at the voice much marveling; at length\r\nNot unamaz’d she thus in answer spake.\r\nWhat may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc’t\r\nBy Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?\r\nThe first at lest of these I thought deni’d\r\nTo Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day\r\nCreated mute to all articulat sound;\r\nThe latter I demurre, for in thir looks\r\nMuch reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.\r\nThee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field\r\nI knew, but not with human voice endu’d;\r\nRedouble then this miracle, and say,\r\nHow cam’st thou speakable of mute, and how\r\nTo me so friendly grown above the rest\r\nOf brutal kind, that daily are in sight?\r\nSay, for such wonder claims attention due.\r\n\r\nTo whom the guileful Tempter thus reply’d.\r\nEmpress of this fair World, resplendent _Eve_,\r\nEasie to mee it is to tell thee all\r\nWhat thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:\r\nI was at first as other Beasts that graze\r\nThe trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,\r\nAs was my food, nor aught but food discern’d\r\nOr Sex, and apprehended nothing high:\r\nTill on a day roaving the field, I chanc’d\r\nA goodly Tree farr distant to behold\r\nLoaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,\r\nRuddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;\r\nWhen from the boughes a savorie odour blow’n,\r\nGrateful to appetite, more pleas’d my sense\r\nThen smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats\r\nOf Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,\r\nUnsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.\r\nTo satisfie the sharp desire I had\r\nOf tasting those fair Apples, I resolv’d\r\nNot to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,\r\nPowerful perswaders, quick’nd at the scent\r\nOf that alluring fruit, urg’d me so keene.\r\nAbout the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,\r\nFor high from ground the branches would require\r\nThy utmost reach or _Adams_: Round the Tree\r\nAll other Beasts that saw, with like desire\r\nLonging and envying stood, but could not reach.\r\nAmid the Tree now got, where plentie hung\r\nTempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill\r\nI spar’d not, for such pleasure till that hour\r\nAt Feed or Fountain never had I found.\r\nSated at length, ere long I might perceave\r\nStrange alteration in me, to degree\r\nOf Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech\r\nWanted not long, though to this shape retaind.\r\nThenceforth to Speculations high or deep\r\nI turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind\r\nConsiderd all things visible in Heav’n,\r\nOr Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;\r\nBut all that fair and good in thy Divine\r\nSemblance, and in thy Beauties heav’nly Ray\r\nUnited I beheld; no Fair to thine\r\nEquivalent or second, which compel’d\r\nMee thus, though importune perhaps, to come\r\nAnd gaze, and worship thee of right declar’d\r\nSovran of Creatures, universal Dame.\r\n\r\nSo talk’d the spirited sly Snake; and _Eve_\r\nYet more amaz’d unwarie thus reply’d.\r\n\r\nSerpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt\r\nThe vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov’d:\r\nBut say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?\r\nFor many are the Trees of God that grow\r\nIn Paradise, and various, yet unknown\r\nTo us, in such abundance lies our choice,\r\nAs leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,\r\nStill hanging incorruptible, till men\r\nGrow up to thir provision, and more hands\r\nHelp to disburden Nature of her Bearth.\r\n\r\nTo whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.\r\nEmpress, the way is readie, and not long,\r\nBeyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,\r\nFast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past\r\nOf blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept\r\nMy conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.\r\n\r\nLead then, said _Eve_.  Hee leading swiftly rowld\r\nIn tangles, and make intricate seem strait,\r\nTo mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy\r\nBright’ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire\r\nCompact of unctuous vapor, which the Night\r\nCondenses, and the cold invirons round,\r\nKindl’d through agitation to a Flame,\r\nWhich oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,\r\nHovering and blazing with delusive Light,\r\nMisleads th’ amaz’d Night-wanderer from his way\r\nTo Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole,\r\nThere swallow’d up and lost, from succour farr.\r\nSo glister’d the dire Snake and into fraud\r\nLed _Eve_ our credulous Mother, to the Tree\r\nOf prohibition, root of all our woe;\r\nWhich when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.\r\n\r\nSerpent, we might have spar’d our coming hither,\r\nFruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,\r\nThe credit of whose vertue rest with thee,\r\nWondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.\r\nBut of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;\r\nGod so commanded, and left that Command\r\nSole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live\r\nLaw to our selves, our Reason is our Law.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Tempter guilefully repli’d.\r\nIndeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit\r\nOf all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,\r\nYet Lords declar’d of all in Earth or Aire?\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Eve_ yet sinless.  Of the Fruit\r\nOf each Tree in the Garden we may eate,\r\nBut of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst\r\nThe Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate\r\nThereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.\r\n\r\nShe scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold\r\nThe Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love\r\nTo Man, and indignation at his wrong,\r\nNew part puts on, and as to passion mov’d,\r\nFluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act\r\nRais’d, as of som great matter to begin.\r\nAs when of old som Orator renound\r\nIn _Athens_ or free _Rome_, where Eloquence\r\nFlourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,\r\nStood in himself collected, while each part,\r\nMotion, each act won audience ere the tongue,\r\nSomtimes in highth began, as no delay\r\nOf Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.\r\nSo standing, moving, or to highth upgrown\r\nThe Tempter all impassiond thus began.\r\n\r\nO Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,\r\nMother of Science, Now I feel thy Power\r\nWithin me cleere, not onely to discerne\r\nThings in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes\r\nOf highest Agents, deemd however wise.\r\nQueen of this Universe, doe not believe\r\nThose rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:\r\nHow should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life\r\nTo Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,\r\nMee who have touch’d and tasted, yet both live,\r\nAnd life more perfet have attaind then Fate\r\nMeant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.\r\nShall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast\r\nIs open? or will God incense his ire\r\nFor such a pretty Trespass, and not praise\r\nRather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain\r\nOf Death denounc’t, whatever thing Death be,\r\nDeterrd not from atchieving what might leade\r\nTo happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;\r\nOf good, how just? of evil, if what is evil\r\nBe real, why not known, since easier shunnd?\r\nGod therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;\r\nNot just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:\r\nYour feare it self of Death removes the feare.\r\nWhy then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,\r\nWhy but to keep ye low and ignorant,\r\nHis worshippers; he knows that in the day\r\nYe Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,\r\nYet are but dim, shall perfetly be then\r\nOp’nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,\r\nKnowing both Good and Evil as they know.\r\nThat ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,\r\nInternal Man, is but proportion meet,\r\nI of brute human, yee of human Gods.\r\nSo ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off\r\nHuman, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,\r\nThough threat’nd, which no worse then this can bring\r\nAnd what are Gods that Man may not become\r\nAs they, participating God-like food?\r\nThe Gods are first, and that advantage use\r\nOn our belief, that all from them proceeds,\r\nI question it, for this fair Earth I see,\r\nWarm’d by the Sun, producing every kind,\r\nThem nothing: If they all things, who enclos’d\r\nKnowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,\r\nThat whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains\r\nWisdom without their leave? and wherein lies\r\nTh’ offence, that Man should thus attain to know?\r\nWhat can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree\r\nImpart against his will if all be his?\r\nOr is it envie, and can envie dwell\r\nIn heav’nly brests? these, these and many more\r\nCauses import your need of this fair Fruit.\r\nGoddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.\r\n\r\nHe ended, and his words replete with guile\r\nInto her heart too easie entrance won:\r\nFixt on the Fruit she gaz’d, which to behold\r\nMight tempt alone, and in her ears the sound\r\nYet rung of his perswasive words, impregn’d\r\nWith Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;\r\nMeanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak’d\r\nAn eager appetite, rais’d by the smell\r\nSo savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,\r\nInclinable now grown to touch or taste,\r\nSollicited her longing eye; yet first\r\nPausing a while, thus to her self she mus’d.\r\n\r\nGreat are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,\r\nThough kept from Man, & worthy to be admir’d,\r\nWhose taste, too long forborn, at first assay\r\nGave elocution to the mute, and taught\r\nThe Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:\r\nThy praise hee also who forbids thy use,\r\nConceales not from us, naming thee the Tree\r\nOf Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;\r\nForbids us then to taste, but his forbidding\r\nCommends thee more, while it inferrs the good\r\nBy thee communicated, and our want:\r\nFor good unknown, sure is not had, or had\r\nAnd yet unknown, is as not had at all.\r\nIn plain then, what forbids he but to know,\r\nForbids us good, forbids us to be wise?\r\nSuch prohibitions binde not.  But if Death\r\nBind us with after-bands, what profits then\r\nOur inward freedom?  In the day we eate\r\nOf this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.\r\nHow dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,\r\nAnd knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,\r\nIrrational till then.  For us alone\r\nWas death invented? or to us deni’d\r\nThis intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?\r\nFor Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first\r\nHath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy\r\nThe good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,\r\nFriendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.\r\nWhat fear I then, rather what know to feare\r\nUnder this ignorance of Good and Evil,\r\nOf God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?\r\nHere grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,\r\nFair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,\r\nOf vertue to make wise: what hinders then\r\nTo reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?\r\n\r\nSo saying, her rash hand in evil hour\r\nForth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:\r\nEarth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat\r\nSighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,\r\nThat all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk\r\nThe guiltie Serpent, and well might, for _Eve_\r\nIntent now wholly on her taste, naught else\r\nRegarded, such delight till then, as seemd,\r\nIn Fruit she never tasted, whether true\r\nOr fansied so, through expectation high\r\nOf knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.\r\nGreedily she ingorg’d without restraint,\r\nAnd knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,\r\nAnd hight’nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,\r\nThus to her self she pleasingly began.\r\n\r\nO Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\r\nIn Paradise, of operation blest\r\nTo Sapience, hitherto obscur’d, infam’d,\r\nAnd thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\r\nCreated; but henceforth my early care,\r\nNot without Song, each Morning, and due praise\r\nShall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\r\nOf thy full branches offer’d free to all;\r\nTill dieted by thee I grow mature\r\nIn knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\r\nThough others envie what they cannot give;\r\nFor had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\r\nThus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\r\nBest guide; not following thee, I had remaind\r\nIn ignorance, thou op’nst Wisdoms way,\r\nAnd giv’st access, though secret she retire.\r\nAnd I perhaps am secret; Heav’n is high,\r\nHigh and remote to see from thence distinct\r\nEach thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\r\nMay have diverted from continual watch\r\nOur great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\r\nAbout him.  But to _Adam_ in what sort\r\nShall I appeer? shall I to him make known\r\nAs yet my change, and give him to partake\r\nFull happiness with mee, or rather not,\r\nBut keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\r\nWithout Copartner? so to add what wants\r\nIn Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\r\nAnd render me more equal, and perhaps\r\nA thing not undesireable, somtime\r\nSuperior; for inferior who is free?\r\nThis may be well: but what if God have seen,\r\nAnd Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\r\nAnd _Adam_ wedded to another _Eve_,\r\nShall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\r\nA death to think.  Confirm’d then I resolve,\r\n_Adam_ shall share with me in bliss or woe:\r\nSo dear I love him, that with him all deaths\r\nI could endure; without him live no life.\r\n\r\nSo saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\r\nBut first low Reverence don, as to the power\r\nThat dwelt within, whose presence had infus’d\r\nInto the plant sciential sap, deriv’d\r\nFrom Nectar, drink of Gods.  _Adam_ the while\r\nWaiting desirous her return, had wove\r\nOf choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\r\nHer Tresses, and her rural labours crown\r\nAs Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\r\nGreat joy he promis’d to his thoughts, and new\r\nSolace in her return, so long delay’d;\r\nYet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\r\nMisgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\r\nAnd forth to meet her went, the way she took\r\nThat Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\r\nOf Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\r\nScarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\r\nA bough of fairest fruit that downie smil’d,\r\nNew gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus’d.\r\nTo him she hasted, in her face excuse\r\nCame Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\r\nWhich with bland words at will she thus addrest.\r\n\r\nHast thou not wonderd, _Adam_, at my stay?\r\nThee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv’d\r\nThy presence, agonie of love till now\r\nNot felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\r\nMean I to trie, what rash untri’d I sought,\r\nThe paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\r\nHath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\r\nThis Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\r\nOf danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\r\nOp’ning the way, but of Divine effect\r\nTo open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\r\nAnd hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\r\nOr not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\r\nHath eat’n of the fruit, and is become,\r\nNot dead, as we are threatn’d, but thenceforth\r\nEndu’d with human voice and human sense,\r\nReasoning to admiration, and with mee\r\nPerswasively hath so prevaild, that I\r\nHave also tasted, and have also found\r\nTh’ effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\r\nDimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\r\nAnd growing up to Godhead; which for thee\r\nChiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\r\nFor bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\r\nTedious, unshar’d with thee, and odious soon.\r\nThou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\r\nMay joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\r\nLeast thou not tasting, different degree\r\nDisjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\r\nDeitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\r\n\r\nThus _Eve_ with Countnance blithe her storie told;\r\nBut in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\r\nOn th’ other side, _Adam_, soon as he heard\r\nThe fatal Trespass don by _Eve_, amaz’d,\r\nAstonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\r\nRan through his veins, and all his joynts relax’d;\r\nFrom his slack hand the Garland wreath’d for _Eve_\r\nDown drop’d, and all the faded Roses shed:\r\nSpeechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\r\nFirst to himself he inward silence broke.\r\n\r\nO fairest of Creation, last and best\r\nOf all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell’d\r\nWhatever can to fight or thought be found,\r\nHoly, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!\r\nHow art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,\r\nDefac’t, deflourd, and now to Death devote?\r\nRather how hast thou yeelded to transgress\r\nThe strict forbiddance, how to violate\r\nThe sacred Fruit forbidd’n! som cursed fraud\r\nOf Enemie hath beguil’d thee, yet unknown,\r\nAnd mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee\r\nCertain my resolution is to Die;\r\nHow can I live without thee, how forgoe\r\nThy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn’d,\r\nTo live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?\r\nShould God create another _Eve_, and I\r\nAnother Rib afford, yet loss of thee\r\nWould never from my heart; no no, I feel\r\nThe Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,\r\nBone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State\r\nMine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.\r\n\r\nSo having said, as one from sad dismay\r\nRecomforted, and after thoughts disturbd\r\nSubmitting to what seemd remediless,\r\nThus in calme mood his Words to _Eve_ he turnd.\r\n\r\nBold deed thou hast presum’d, adventrous _Eve_,\r\nAnd peril great provok’t, who thus hast dar’d\r\nHad it bin onely coveting to Eye\r\nThat sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,\r\nMuch more to taste it under banne to touch.\r\nBut past who can recall, or don undoe?\r\nNot God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so\r\nPerhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact\r\nIs not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,\r\nProfan’d first by the Serpent, by him first\r\nMade common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;\r\nNor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,\r\nLives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man\r\nHigher degree of Life, inducement strong\r\nTo us, as likely tasting to attaine\r\nProportional ascent, which cannot be\r\nBut to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.\r\nNor can I think that God, Creator wise,\r\nThough threatning, will in earnest so destroy\r\nUs his prime Creatures, dignifi’d so high,\r\nSet over all his Works, which in our Fall,\r\nFor us created, needs with us must faile,\r\nDependent made; so God shall uncreate,\r\nBe frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,\r\nNot well conceav’d of God, who though his Power\r\nCreation could repeate, yet would be loath\r\nUs to abolish, least the Adversary\r\nTriumph and say; Fickle their State whom God\r\nMost Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first\r\nHe ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?\r\nMatter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.\r\nHowever I with thee have fixt my Lot,\r\nCertain to undergoe like doom, if Death\r\nConsort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;\r\nSo forcible within my heart I feel\r\nThe Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,\r\nMy own in thee, for what thou art is mine;\r\nOur State cannot be severd, we are one,\r\nOne Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.\r\n\r\nSo _Adam_, and thus _Eve_ to him repli’d.\r\nO glorious trial of exceeding Love,\r\nIllustrious evidence, example high!\r\nIngaging me to emulate, but short\r\nOf thy perfection, how shall I attaine,\r\n_Adam_, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,\r\nAnd gladly of our Union heare thee speak,\r\nOne Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff\r\nThis day affords, declaring thee resolvd,\r\nRather then Death or aught then Death more dread\r\nShall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,\r\nTo undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,\r\nIf any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,\r\nWhose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,\r\nDirect, or by occasion hath presented\r\nThis happie trial of thy Love, which else\r\nSo eminently never had bin known.\r\nWere it I thought Death menac’t would ensue\r\nThis my attempt, I would sustain alone\r\nThe worst, and not perswade thee, rather die\r\nDeserted, then oblige thee with a fact\r\nPernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur’d\r\nRemarkably so late of thy so true,\r\nSo faithful Love unequald; but I feel\r\nFarr otherwise th’ event, not Death, but Life\r\nAugmented, op’nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,\r\nTaste so Divine, that what of sweet before\r\nHath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.\r\nOn my experience, _Adam_, freely taste,\r\nAnd fear of Death deliver to the Windes.\r\n\r\nSo saying, she embrac’d him, and for joy\r\nTenderly wept, much won that he his Love\r\nHad so enobl’d, as of choice to incurr\r\nDivine displeasure for her sake, or Death.\r\nIn recompence (for such compliance bad\r\nSuch recompence best merits) from the bough\r\nShe gave him of that fair enticing Fruit\r\nWith liberal hand: he scrupl’d not to eat\r\nAgainst his better knowledge, not deceav’d,\r\nBut fondly overcome with Femal charm.\r\nEarth trembl’d from her entrails, as again\r\nIn pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,\r\nSkie lowr’d, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops\r\nWept at compleating of the mortal Sin\r\nOriginal; while _Adam_ took no thought,\r\nEating his fill, nor _Eve_ to iterate\r\nHer former trespass fear’d, the more to soothe\r\nHim with her lov’d societie, that now\r\nAs with new Wine intoxicated both\r\nThey swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel\r\nDivinitie within them breeding wings\r\nWherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit\r\nFarr other operation first displaid,\r\nCarnal desire enflaming, hee on _Eve_\r\nBegan to cast lascivious Eyes, she him\r\nAs wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:\r\nTill _Adam_ thus ’gan _Eve_ to dalliance move.\r\n\r\n_Eve_, now I see thou art exact of taste,\r\nAnd elegant, of Sapience no small part,\r\nSince to each meaning savour we apply,\r\nAnd Palate call judicious; I the praise\r\nYeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey’d.\r\nMuch pleasure we have lost, while we abstain’d\r\nFrom this delightful Fruit, nor known till now\r\nTrue relish, tasting; if such pleasure be\r\nIn things to us forbidden, it might be wish’d,\r\nFor this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.\r\nBut come, so well refresh’t, now let us play,\r\nAs meet is, after such delicious Fare;\r\nFor never did thy Beautie since the day\r\nI saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn’d\r\nWith all perfections, so enflame my sense\r\nWith ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now\r\nThen ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.\r\n\r\nSo said he, and forbore not glance or toy\r\nOf amorous intent, well understood\r\nOf _Eve_, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.\r\nHer hand he seis’d, and to a shadie bank,\r\nThick overhead with verdant roof imbowr’d\r\nHe led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,\r\nPansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,\r\nAnd Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.\r\nThere they thir fill of Love and Loves disport\r\nTook largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,\r\nThe solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep\r\nOppress’d them, wearied with thir amorous play.\r\nSoon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,\r\nThat with exhilerating vapour bland\r\nAbout thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers\r\nMade erre, was now exhal’d, and grosser sleep\r\nBred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams\r\nEncumberd, now had left them, up they rose\r\nAs from unrest, and each the other viewing,\r\nSoon found thir Eyes how op’nd, and thir minds\r\nHow dark’nd; innocence, that as a veile\r\nHad shadow’d them from knowing ill, was gon,\r\nJust confidence, and native righteousness,\r\nAnd honour from about them, naked left\r\nTo guiltie shame hee cover’d, but his Robe\r\nUncover’d more.  So rose the _Danite_ strong\r\n_Herculean Samson_ from the Harlot-lap\r\nOf _Philistean Dalilah_, and wak’d\r\nShorn of his strength, They destitute and bare\r\nOf all thir vertue: silent, and in face\r\nConfounded long they sate, as struck’n mute,\r\nTill _Adam_, though not less then _Eve_ abasht,\r\nAt length gave utterance to these words constraind.\r\n\r\nO _Eve_, in evil hour thou didst give care\r\nTo that false Worm, of whomsoever taught\r\nTo counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,\r\nFalse in our promis’d Rising; since our Eyes\r\nOp’nd we find indeed, and find we know\r\nBoth Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,\r\nBad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,\r\nWhich leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,\r\nOf Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,\r\nOur wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,\r\nAnd in our Faces evident the signes\r\nOf foul concupiscence; whence evil store;\r\nEven shame, the last of evils; of the first\r\nBe sure then.  How shall I behold the face\r\nHenceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy\r\nAnd rapture so oft beheld? those heav’nly shapes\r\nWill dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze\r\nInsufferably bright.  O might I here\r\nIn solitude live savage, in some glad\r\nObscur’d, where highest Woods impenetrable\r\nTo Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,\r\nAnd brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,\r\nYe Cedars, with innumerable boughs\r\nHide me, where I may never see them more.\r\nBut let us now, as in bad plight, devise\r\nWhat best may for the present serve to hide\r\nThe Parts of each from other, that seem most\r\nTo shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,\r\nSome Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,\r\nAnd girded on our loyns, may cover round\r\nThose middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,\r\nThere sit not, and reproach us as unclean.\r\n\r\nSo counsel’d hee, and both together went\r\nInto the thickest Wood, there soon they chose\r\nThe Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown’d,\r\nBut such as at this day to _Indians_ known\r\nIn _Malabar_ or _Decan_ spreds her Armes\r\nBraunching so broad and long, that in the ground\r\nThe bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow\r\nAbout the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade\r\nHigh overarch’t, and echoing Walks between;\r\nThere oft the _Indian_ Herdsman shunning heate\r\nShelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds\r\nAt Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves\r\nThey gatherd, broad as _Amazonian_ Targe,\r\nAnd with what skill they had, together sowd,\r\nTo gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide\r\nThir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike\r\nTo that first naked Glorie.  Such of late\r\n_Columbus_ found th’ _American_ to girt\r\nWith featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde\r\nAmong the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.\r\nThus fenc’t, and as they thought, thir shame in part\r\nCoverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,\r\nThey sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares\r\nRaind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within\r\nBegan to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,\r\nMistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore\r\nThir inward State of Mind, calme Region once\r\nAnd full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:\r\nFor Understanding rul’d not, and the Will\r\nHeard not her lore, both in subjection now\r\nTo sensual Appetite, who from beneathe\r\nUsurping over sovran Reason claimd\r\nSuperior sway: From thus distemperd brest,\r\n_Adam_, estrang’d in look and alterd stile,\r\nSpeech intermitted thus to _Eve_ renewd.\r\n\r\nWould thou hadst heark’nd to my words, & stai’d\r\nWith me, as I besought thee, when that strange\r\nDesire of wandring this unhappie Morn,\r\nI know not whence possessd thee; we had then\r\nRemaind still happie, not as now, despoild\r\nOf all our good, sham’d, naked, miserable.\r\nLet none henceforth seek needless cause to approve\r\nThe Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek\r\nSuch proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.\r\n\r\nTo whom soon mov’d with touch of blame thus _Eve_.\r\nWhat words have past thy Lips, _Adam_ severe,\r\nImput’st thou that to my default, or will\r\nOf wandering, as thou call’st it, which who knows\r\nBut might as ill have happ’nd thou being by,\r\nOr to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,\r\nOr bere th’ attempt, thou couldst not have discernd\r\nFraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;\r\nNo ground of enmitie between us known,\r\nWhy hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.\r\nWas I to have never parted from thy side?\r\nAs good have grown there still a liveless Rib.\r\nBeing as I am, why didst not thou the Head\r\nCommand me absolutely not to go,\r\nGoing into such danger as thou saidst?\r\nToo facil then thou didst not much gainsay,\r\nNay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.\r\nHadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,\r\nNeither had I transgress’d, nor thou with mee.\r\n\r\nTo whom then first incenst _Adam_ repli’d.\r\nIs this the Love, is the recompence\r\nOf mine to thee, ingrateful _Eve_, exprest\r\nImmutable when thou wert lost, not I,\r\nWho might have liv’d and joyd immortal bliss,\r\nYet willingly chose rather Death with thee:\r\nAnd am I now upbraided, as the cause\r\nOf thy transgressing? not enough severe,\r\nIt seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?\r\nI warn’d thee, I admonish’d thee, foretold\r\nThe danger, and the lurking Enemie\r\nThat lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,\r\nAnd force upon free Will hath here no place.\r\nBut confidence then bore thee on, secure\r\nEither to meet no danger, or to finde\r\nMatter of glorious trial; and perhaps\r\nI also err’d in overmuch admiring\r\nWhat seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought\r\nNo evil durst attempt thee, but I rue\r\nThat errour now, which is become my crime,\r\nAnd thou th’ accuser.  Thus it shall befall\r\nHim who to worth in Women overtrusting\r\nLets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,\r\nAnd left to her self, if evil thence ensue,\r\nShee first his weak indulgence will accuse.\r\n\r\nThus they in mutual accusation spent\r\nThe fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning\r\nAnd of thir vain contest appeer’d no end.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK IX.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hainous and despightfull act\r\nOf _Satan_ done in Paradise, and how\r\nHee in the Serpent had perverted _Eve_,\r\nHer Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,\r\nWas known in Heav’n; for what can scape the Eye\r\nOf God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart\r\nOmniscient, who in all things wise and just,\r\nHinder’d not _Satan_ to attempt the minde\r\nOf Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm’d,\r\nComplete to have discover’d and repulst\r\nWhatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.\r\nFor still they knew, and ought to have still remember’d\r\nThe high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,\r\nWhoever tempted; which they not obeying,\r\nIncurr’d, what could they less, the penaltie,\r\nAnd manifold in sin, deserv’d to fall.\r\nUp into Heav’n from Paradise in hast\r\nTh’ Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad\r\nFor Man, for of his state by this they knew,\r\nMuch wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln\r\nEntrance unseen.  Soon as th’ unwelcome news\r\nFrom Earth arriv’d at Heaven Gate, displeas’d\r\nAll were who heard, dim sadness did not spare\r\nThat time Celestial visages, yet mixt\r\nWith pitie, violated not thir bliss.\r\nAbout the new-arriv’d, in multitudes\r\nTh’ ethereal People ran, to hear and know\r\nHow all befell: they towards the Throne Supream\r\nAccountable made haste to make appear\r\nWith righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,\r\nAnd easily approv’d; when the most High\r\nEternal Father from his secret Cloud,\r\nAmidst in Thunder utter’d thus his voice.\r\n\r\nAssembl’d Angels, and ye Powers return’d\r\nFrom unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,\r\nNor troubl’d at these tidings from the Earth,\r\nWhich your sincerest care could not prevent,\r\nForetold so lately what would come to pass,\r\nWhen first this Tempter cross’d the Gulf from Hell.\r\nI told ye then he should prevail and speed\r\nOn his bad Errand, Man should be seduc’t\r\nAnd flatter’d out of all, believing lies\r\nAgainst his Maker; no Decree of mine\r\nConcurring to necessitate his Fall,\r\nOr touch with lightest moment of impulse\r\nHis free Will, to her own inclining left\r\nIn eevn scale.  But fall’n he is, and now\r\nWhat rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass\r\nOn his transgression, Death denounc’t that day,\r\nWhich he presumes already vain and void,\r\nBecause not yet inflicted, as he fear’d,\r\nBy some immediate stroak; but soon shall find\r\nForbearance no acquittance ere day end.\r\nJustice shall not return as bountie scorn’d.\r\nBut whom send I to judge them? whom but thee\r\nVicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr’d\r\nAll Judgement, whether in Heav’n, or Earth; or Hell.\r\nEasie it may be seen that I intend\r\nMercie collegue with Justice, sending thee\r\nMans Friend, his Mediator, his design’d\r\nBoth Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,\r\nAnd destin’d Man himself to judge Man fall’n.\r\n\r\nSo spake the Father, and unfoulding bright\r\nToward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son\r\nBlaz’d forth unclouded Deitie; he full\r\nResplendent all his Father manifest\r\nExpress’d, and thus divinely answer’d milde.\r\n\r\nFather Eternal, thine is to decree,\r\nMine both in Heav’n and Earth to do thy will\r\nSupream, that thou in mee thy Son belov’d\r\nMayst ever rest well pleas’d.  I go to judge\r\nOn Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,\r\nWhoever judg’d, the worst on mee must light,\r\nWhen time shall be, for so I undertook\r\nBefore thee; and not repenting, this obtaine\r\nOf right, that I may mitigate thir doom\r\nOn me deriv’d, yet I shall temper so\r\nJustice with Mercie, as may illustrate most\r\nThem fully satisfied, and thee appease.\r\nAttendance none shall need, nor Train, where none\r\nAre to behold the Judgement, but the judg’d,\r\nThose two; the third best absent is condemn’d,\r\nConvict by flight, and Rebel to all Law\r\nConviction to the Serpent none belongs.\r\n\r\nThus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose\r\nOf high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,\r\nPrincedoms, and Dominations ministrant\r\nAccompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence\r\n_Eden_ and all the Coast in prospect lay.\r\nDown he descended strait; the speed of Gods\r\nTime counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing’d.\r\nNow was the Sun in Western cadence low\r\nFrom Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour\r\nTo fan the Earth now wak’d, and usher in\r\nThe Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole\r\nCame the mild Judge and Intercessor both\r\nTo sentence Man: the voice of God they heard\r\nNow walking in the Garden, by soft windes\r\nBrought to thir Ears, while day declin’d, they heard\r\nAnd from his presence hid themselves among\r\nThe thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God\r\nApproaching, thus to _Adam_ call’d aloud.\r\n\r\nWhere art thou _Adam_, wont with joy to meet\r\nMy coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,\r\nNot pleas’d, thus entertaind with solitude,\r\nWhere obvious dutie erewhile appear’d unsaught:\r\nOr come I less conspicuous, or what change\r\nAbsents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.\r\nHe came, and with him _Eve_, more loth, though first\r\nTo offend, discount’nanc’t both, and discompos’d;\r\nLove was not in thir looks, either to God\r\nOr to each other, but apparent guilt,\r\nAnd shame, and perturbation, and despaire,\r\nAnger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.\r\nWhence _Adam_ faultring long, thus answer’d brief.\r\n\r\nI heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice\r\nAffraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom\r\nThe gracious Judge without revile repli’d.\r\n\r\nMy voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear’d,\r\nBut still rejoyc’t, how is it now become\r\nSo dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who\r\nHath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree\r\nWhereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Adam_ sore beset repli’d.\r\nO Heav’n! in evil strait this day I stand\r\nBefore my Judge, either to undergoe\r\nMy self the total Crime, or to accuse\r\nMy other self, the partner of my life;\r\nWhose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,\r\nI should conceal, and not expose to blame\r\nBy my complaint; but strict necessitie\r\nSubdues me, and calamitous constraint,\r\nLeast on my head both sin and punishment,\r\nHowever insupportable, be all\r\nDevolv’d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou\r\nWouldst easily detect what I conceale.\r\nThis Woman whom thou mad’st to be my help,\r\nAnd gav’st me as thy perfet gift, so good,\r\nSo fit, so acceptable, so Divine,\r\nThat from her hand I could suspect no ill,\r\nAnd what she did, whatever in it self,\r\nHer doing seem’d to justifie the deed;\r\nShee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.\r\n\r\nTo whom the sovran Presence thus repli’d.\r\nWas shee thy God, that her thou didst obey\r\nBefore his voice, or was shee made thy guide,\r\nSuperior, or but equal, that to her\r\nThou did’st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place\r\nWherein God set thee above her made of thee,\r\nAnd for thee, whose perfection farr excell’d\r\nHers in all real dignitie: Adornd\r\nShe was indeed, and lovely to attract\r\nThy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts\r\nWere such as under Government well seem’d,\r\nUnseemly to beare rule, which was thy part\r\nAnd person, had’st thou known thy self aright.\r\n\r\nSo having said, he thus to _Eve_ in few:\r\nSay Woman, what is this which thou hast done?\r\n\r\nTo whom sad _Eve_ with shame nigh overwhelm’d,\r\nConfessing soon, yet not before her Judge\r\nBold or loquacious, thus abasht repli’d.\r\n\r\nThe Serpent me beguil’d and I did eate.\r\n\r\nWhich when the Lord God heard, without delay\r\nTo Judgement he proceeded on th’ accus’d\r\nSerpent though brute, unable to transferre\r\nThe Guilt on him who made him instrument\r\nOf mischief, and polluted from the end\r\nOf his Creation; justly then accurst,\r\nAs vitiated in Nature: more to know\r\nConcern’d not Man (since he no further knew)\r\nNor alter’d his offence; yet God at last\r\nTo Satan first in sin his doom apply’d,\r\nThough in mysterious terms, judg’d as then best:\r\nAnd on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.\r\n\r\nBecause thou hast done this, thou art accurst\r\nAbove all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;\r\nUpon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,\r\nAnd dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.\r\nBetween Thee and the Woman I will put\r\nEnmitie, and between thine and her Seed;\r\nHer Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.\r\n\r\nSo spake this Oracle, then verifi’d\r\nWhen _Jesus_ son of _Mary_ second _Eve_,\r\nSaw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav’n,\r\nPrince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave\r\nSpoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht\r\nIn open shew, and with ascention bright\r\nCaptivity led captive through the Aire,\r\nThe Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,\r\nWhom he shall tread at last under our feet;\r\nEevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,\r\nAnd to the Woman thus his Sentence turn’d.\r\n\r\nThy sorrow I will greatly multiplie\r\nBy thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring\r\nIn sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will\r\nThine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.\r\n\r\nOn _Adam_ last thus judgement he pronounc’d.\r\nBecause thou hast heark’nd to the voice of thy Wife,\r\nAnd eaten of the Tree concerning which\r\nI charg’d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,\r\nCurs’d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow\r\nShalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;\r\nThornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth\r\nUnbid, and thou shalt eate th’ Herb of th’ Field,\r\nIn the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,\r\nTill thou return unto the ground, for thou\r\nOut of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,\r\nFor dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.\r\n\r\n So judg’d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,\r\nAnd th’ instant stroke of Death denounc’t that day\r\nRemov’d farr off; then pittying how they stood\r\nBefore him naked to the aire, that now\r\nMust suffer change, disdain’d not to begin\r\nThenceforth the forme of servant to assume,\r\nAs when he wash’d his servants feet, so now\r\nAs Father of his Familie he clad\r\nThir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,\r\nOr as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;\r\nAnd thought not much to cloath his Enemies:\r\nNor hee thir outward onely with the Skins\r\nOf Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more\r\nOpprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,\r\nAraying cover’d from his Fathers sight.\r\nTo him with swift ascent he up returnd,\r\nInto his blissful bosom reassum’d\r\nIn glory as of old, to him appeas’d\r\nAll, though all-knowing, what had past with Man\r\nRecounted, mixing intercession sweet.\r\nMeanwhile ere thus was sin’d and judg’d on Earth,\r\nWithin the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,\r\nIn counterview within the Gates, that now\r\nStood open wide, belching outrageous flame\r\nFarr into _Chaos_, since the Fiend pass’d through,\r\nSin opening, who thus now to Death began.\r\n\r\nO Son, why sit we here each other viewing\r\nIdlely, while Satan our great Author thrives\r\nIn other Worlds, and happier Seat provides\r\nFor us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be\r\nBut that success attends him; if mishap,\r\nEre this he had return’d, with fury driv’n\r\nBy his Avenger, since no place like this\r\nCan fit his punishment, or their revenge.\r\nMethinks I feel new strength within me rise,\r\nWings growing, and Dominion giv’n me large\r\nBeyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,\r\nOr sympathie, or som connatural force\r\nPowerful at greatest distance to unite\r\nWith secret amity things of like kinde\r\nBy secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade\r\nInseparable must with mee along:\r\nFor Death from Sin no power can separate.\r\nBut least the difficultie of passing back\r\nStay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe\r\nImpassable, impervious, let us try\r\nAdventrous work, yet to thy power and mine\r\nNot unagreeable, to found a path\r\nOver this Maine from Hell to that new World\r\nWhere Satan now prevailes, a Monument\r\nOf merit high to all th’ infernal Host,\r\nEasing thir passage hence, for intercourse,\r\nOr transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.\r\nNor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn\r\nBy this new felt attraction and instinct.\r\n\r\nWhom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.\r\nGoe whither Fate and inclination strong\r\nLeads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre\r\nThe way, thou leading, such a sent I draw\r\nOf carnage, prey innumerable, and taste\r\nThe savour of Death from all things there that live:\r\nNor shall I to the work thou enterprisest\r\nBe wanting, but afford thee equal aid.\r\n\r\nSo saying, with delight he snuff’d the smell\r\nOf mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock\r\nOf ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,\r\nAgainst the day of Battel, to a Field,\r\nWhere Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur’d\r\nWith sent of living Carcasses design’d\r\nFor death, the following day, in bloodie fight.\r\nSo sented the grim Feature, and upturn’d\r\nHis Nostril wide into the murkie Air,\r\nSagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.\r\nThen Both from out Hell Gates into the waste\r\nWide Anarchie of _Chaos_ damp and dark\r\nFlew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)\r\nHovering upon the Waters; what they met\r\nSolid or slimie, as in raging Sea\r\nTost up and down, together crowded drove\r\nFrom each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.\r\nAs when two Polar Winds blowing adverse\r\nUpon the _Cronian_ Sea, together drive\r\nMountains of Ice, that stop th’ imagin’d way\r\nBeyond _Petsora_ Eastward, to the rich\r\n_Cathaian_ Coast.  The aggregated Soyle\r\nDeath with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,\r\nAs with a Trident smote, and fix’t as firm\r\nAs _Delos_ floating once; the rest his look\r\nBound with _Gorgonian_ rigor not to move,\r\nAnd with _Asphaltic_ slime; broad as the Gate,\r\nDeep to the Roots of Hell the gather’d beach\r\nThey fasten’d, and the Mole immense wraught on\r\nOver the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge\r\nOf length prodigious joyning to the Wall\r\nImmoveable of this now fenceless world\r\nForfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,\r\nSmooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.\r\nSo, if great things to small may be compar’d,\r\n_Xerxes_, the Libertie of _Greece_ to yoke,\r\nFrom _Susa_ his _Memnonian_ Palace high\r\nCame to the Sea, and over _Hellespont_\r\nBridging his way, _Europe_ with _Asia_ joyn’d,\r\nAnd scourg’d with many a stroak th’ indignant waves.\r\nNow had they brought the work by wondrous Art\r\nPontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock\r\nOver the vext Abyss, following the track\r\nOf _Satan_, to the selfsame place where hee\r\nFirst lighted from his Wing, and landed safe\r\nFrom out of _Chaos_ to the outside bare\r\nOf this round World: with Pinns of Adamant\r\nAnd Chains they made all fast, too fast they made\r\nAnd durable; and now in little space\r\nThe Confines met of Empyrean Heav’n\r\nAnd of this World, and on the left hand Hell\r\nWith long reach interpos’d; three sev’ral wayes\r\nIn sight, to each of these three places led.\r\nAnd now thir way to Earth they had descri’d,\r\nTo Paradise first tending, when behold\r\n_Satan_ in likeness of an Angel bright\r\nBetwixt the _Centaure_ and the _Scorpion_ stearing\r\nHis _Zenith_, while the Sun in _Aries_ rose:\r\nDisguis’d he came, but those his Children dear\r\nThir Parent soon discern’d, though in disguise.\r\nHee, after _Eve_ seduc’t, unminded slunk\r\nInto the Wood fast by, and changing shape\r\nTo observe the sequel, saw his guileful act\r\nBy _Eve_, though all unweeting, seconded\r\nUpon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought\r\nVain covertures; but when he saw descend\r\nThe Son of God to judge them, terrifi’d\r\nHee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun\r\nThe present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth\r\nMight suddenly inflict; that past, return’d\r\nBy Night, and listning where the hapless Paire\r\nSate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,\r\nThence gatherd his own doom, which understood\r\nNot instant, but of future time.  With joy\r\nAnd tidings fraught, to Hell he now return’d,\r\nAnd at the brink of _Chaos_, neer the foot\r\nOf this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop’t\r\nMet who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.\r\nGreat joy was at thir meeting, and at sight\r\nOf that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas’d.\r\nLong hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire\r\nInchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.\r\n\r\nO Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,\r\nThy Trophies, which thou view’st as not thine own,\r\nThou art thir Author and prime Architect:\r\nFor I no sooner in my Heart divin’d,\r\nMy Heart, which by a secret harmonie\r\nStill moves with thine, joyn’d in connexion sweet,\r\nThat thou on Earth hadst prosper’d, which thy looks\r\nNow also evidence, but straight I felt\r\nThough distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt\r\nThat I must after thee with this thy Son;\r\nSuch fatal consequence unites us three:\r\nHell could no longer hold us in her bounds,\r\nNor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure\r\nDetain from following thy illustrious track.\r\nThou hast atchiev’d our libertie, confin’d\r\nWithin Hell Gates till now, thou us impow’rd\r\nTo fortifie thus farr, and overlay\r\nWith this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.\r\nThine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won\r\nWhat thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain’d\r\nWith odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng’d\r\nOur foile in Heav’n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,\r\nThere didst not; there let him still Victor sway,\r\nAs Battel hath adjudg’d, from this new World\r\nRetiring, by his own doom alienated,\r\nAnd henceforth Monarchie with thee divide\r\nOf all things, parted by th’ Empyreal bounds,\r\nHis Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,\r\nOr trie thee now more dang’rous to his Throne.\r\n\r\nWhom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.\r\nFair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,\r\nHigh proof ye now have giv’n to be the Race\r\nOf _Satan_ (for I glorie in the name,\r\nAntagonist of Heav’ns Almightie King)\r\nAmply have merited of me, of all\r\nTh’ Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav’ns dore\r\nTriumphal with triumphal act have met,\r\nMine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm\r\nHell and this World, one Realm, one Continent\r\nOf easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I\r\nDescend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease\r\nTo my associate Powers, them to acquaint\r\nWith these successes, and with them rejoyce,\r\nYou two this way, among those numerous Orbs\r\nAll yours, right down to Paradise descend;\r\nThere dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth\r\nDominion exercise and in the Aire,\r\nChiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar’d,\r\nHim first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.\r\nMy Substitutes I send ye, and Create\r\nPlenipotent on Earth, of matchless might\r\nIssuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now\r\nMy hold of this new Kingdom all depends,\r\nThrough Sin to Death expos’d by my exploit.\r\nIf your joynt power prevaile, th’ affaires of Hell\r\nNo detriment need feare, goe and be strong.\r\n\r\nSo saying he dismiss’d them, they with speed\r\nThir course through thickest Constellations held\r\nSpreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,\r\nAnd Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips\r\nThen sufferd.  Th’ other way _Satan_ went down\r\nThe Causey to Hell Gate; on either side\r\nDisparted _Chaos_ over built exclaimd,\r\nAnd with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,\r\nThat scorn’d his indignation: through the Gate,\r\nWide open and unguarded, _Satan_ pass’d,\r\nAnd all about found desolate; for those\r\nAppointed to sit there, had left thir charge,\r\nFlown to the upper World; the rest were all\r\nFarr to the inland retir’d, about the walls\r\nOf _Pandemonium_, Citie and proud seate\r\nOf _Lucifer_, so by allusion calld,\r\nOf that bright Starr to _Satan_ paragond.\r\nThere kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand\r\nIn Council sate, sollicitous what chance\r\nMight intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee\r\nDeparting gave command, and they observ’d.\r\nAs when the _Tartar_ from his _Russian_ Foe\r\nBy _Astracan_ over the Snowie Plaines\r\nRetires, or _Bactrian_ Sophi from the hornes\r\nOf _Turkish_ Crescent, leaves all waste beyond\r\nThe Realme of _Aladule_, in his retreate\r\nTo _Tauris_ or _Casbeen_.  So these the late\r\nHeav’n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell\r\nMany a dark League, reduc’t in careful Watch\r\nRound thir Metropolis, and now expecting\r\nEach hour their great adventurer from the search\r\nOf Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,\r\nIn shew plebeian Angel militant\r\nOf lowest order, past; and from the dore\r\nOf that _Plutonian_ Hall, invisible\r\nAscended his high Throne, which under state\r\nOf richest texture spred, at th’ upper end\r\nWas plac’t in regal lustre.  Down a while\r\nHe sate, and round about him saw unseen:\r\nAt last as from a Cloud his fulgent head\r\nAnd shape Starr bright appeer’d, or brighter, clad\r\nWith what permissive glory since his fall\r\nWas left him, or false glitter: All amaz’d\r\nAt that so sudden blaze the _Stygian_ throng\r\nBent thir aspect, and whom they wish’d beheld,\r\nThir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th’ acclaime:\r\nForth rush’d in haste the great consulting Peers,\r\nRais’d from thir dark _Divan_, and with like joy\r\nCongratulant approach’d him, who with hand\r\nSilence, and with these words attention won.\r\n\r\nThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\r\nFor in possession such, not onely of right,\r\nI call ye and declare ye now, returnd\r\nSuccessful beyond hope, to lead ye forth\r\nTriumphant out of this infernal Pit\r\nAbominable, accurst, the house of woe,\r\nAnd Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,\r\nAs Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven\r\nLittle inferiour, by my adventure hard\r\nWith peril great atchiev’d.  Long were to tell\r\nWhat I have don, what sufferd, with what paine\r\nVoyag’d the unreal, vast, unbounded deep\r\nOf horrible confusion, over which\r\nBy Sin and Death a broad way now is pav’d\r\nTo expedite your glorious march; but I\r\nToild out my uncouth passage, forc’t to ride\r\nTh’ untractable Abysse, plung’d in the womb\r\nOf unoriginal _Night_ and _Chaos_ wilde,\r\nThat jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos’d\r\nMy journey strange, with clamorous uproare\r\nProtesting Fate supreame; thence how I found\r\nThe new created World, which fame in Heav’n\r\nLong had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful\r\nOf absolute perfection, therein Man\r\nPlac’t in a Paradise, by our exile\r\nMade happie: Him by fraud I have seduc’d\r\nFrom his Creator, and the more to increase\r\nYour wonder, with an Apple; he thereat\r\nOffended, worth your laughter, hath giv’n up\r\nBoth his beloved Man and all his World,\r\nTo Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,\r\nWithout our hazard, labour or allarme,\r\nTo range in, and to dwell, and over Man\r\nTo rule, as over all he should have rul’d.\r\nTrue is, mee also he hath judg’d, or rather\r\nMee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape\r\nMan I deceav’d: that which to mee belongs,\r\nIs enmity, which he will put between\r\nMee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;\r\nHis Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:\r\nA World who would not purchase with a bruise,\r\nOr much more grievous pain?  Ye have th’ account\r\nOf my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,\r\nBut up and enter now into full bliss.\r\n\r\nSo having said, a while he stood, expecting\r\nThir universal shout and high applause\r\nTo fill his eare, when contrary he hears\r\nOn all sides, from innumerable tongues\r\nA dismal universal hiss, the sound\r\nOf public scorn; he wonderd, but not long\r\nHad leasure, wondring at himself now more;\r\nHis Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,\r\nHis Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining\r\nEach other, till supplanted down he fell\r\nA monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,\r\nReluctant, but in vaine, a greater power\r\nNow rul’d him, punisht in the shape he sin’d,\r\nAccording to his doom: he would have spoke,\r\nBut hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue\r\nTo forked tongue, for now were all transform’d\r\nAlike, to Serpents all as accessories\r\nTo his bold Riot: dreadful was the din\r\nOf hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now\r\nWith complicated monsters, head and taile,\r\nScorpion and Asp, and _Amphisbaena_ dire,\r\n_Cerastes_ hornd, _Hydrus_, and _Ellops_ drear,\r\nAnd _Dipsas_ (Not so thick swarm’d once the Soil\r\nBedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle\r\n_Ophiusa_) but still greatest hee the midst,\r\nNow Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun\r\nIngenderd in the _Pythian_ Vale on slime,\r\nHuge _Python_, and his Power no less he seem’d\r\nAbove the rest still to retain; they all\r\nHim follow’d issuing forth to th’ open Field,\r\nWhere all yet left of that revolted Rout\r\nHeav’n-fall’n, in station stood or just array,\r\nSublime with expectation when to see\r\nIn Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;\r\nThey saw, but other sight instead, a crowd\r\nOf ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,\r\nAnd horrid sympathie; for what they saw,\r\nThey felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,\r\nDown fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,\r\nAnd the dire hiss renew’d, and the dire form\r\nCatcht by Contagion, like in punishment,\r\nAs in thir crime.  Thus was th’ applause they meant,\r\nTurnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame\r\nCast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood\r\nA Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,\r\nHis will who reigns above, to aggravate\r\nThir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that\r\nVVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of _Eve_\r\nUs’d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange\r\nThir earnest eyes they fix’d, imagining\r\nFor one forbidden Tree a multitude\r\nNow ris’n, to work them furder woe or shame;\r\nYet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,\r\nThough to delude them sent, could not abstain,\r\nBut on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees\r\nClimbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks\r\nThat curld _Megaera_: greedily they pluck’d\r\nThe Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew\r\nNeer that bituminous Lake where _Sodom_ flam’d;\r\nThis more delusive, not the touch, but taste\r\nDeceav’d; they fondly thinking to allay\r\nThir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit\r\nChewd bitter Ashes, which th’ offended taste\r\nVVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,\r\nHunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,\r\nVVith hatefullest disrelish writh’d thir jaws\r\nVVith foot and cinders fill’d; so oft they fell\r\nInto the same illusion, not as Man\r\nWhom they triumph’d once lapst.  Thus were they plagu’d\r\nAnd worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,\r\nTill thir lost shape, permitted, they resum’d,\r\nYearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo\r\nThis annual humbling certain number’d days,\r\nTo dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc’t.\r\nHowever some tradition they dispers’d\r\nAmong the Heathen of thir purchase got,\r\nAnd Fabl’d how the Serpent, whom they calld\r\n_Ophion_ with _Eurynome_, the wide-\r\nEncroaching _Eve_ perhaps, had first the rule\r\nOf high _Olympus_, thence by _Saturn_ driv’n\r\nAnd _Ops_, ere yet _Dictaean_ _Jove_ was born.\r\nMean while in Paradise the hellish pair\r\nToo soon arriv’d, _Sin_ there in power before,\r\nOnce actual, now in body, and to dwell\r\nHabitual habitant; behind her _Death_\r\nClose following pace for pace, not mounted yet\r\nOn his pale Horse: to whom _Sin_ thus began.\r\n\r\nSecond of _Satan_ sprung, all conquering Death,\r\nWhat thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd\r\nWith travail difficult, not better farr\r\nThen stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,\r\nUnnam’d, undreaded, and thy self half starv’d?\r\n\r\nWhom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.\r\nTo mee, who with eternal Famin pine,\r\nAlike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,\r\nThere best, where most with ravin I may meet;\r\nWhich here, though plenteous, all too little seems\r\nTo stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.\r\n\r\nTo whom th’ incestuous Mother thus repli’d.\r\nThou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours\r\nFeed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,\r\nNo homely morsels, and whatever thing\r\nThe Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar’d,\r\nTill I in Man residing through the Race,\r\nHis thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,\r\nAnd season him thy last and sweetest prey.\r\n\r\nThis said, they both betook them several wayes,\r\nBoth to destroy, or unimmortal make\r\nAll kinds, and for destruction to mature\r\nSooner or later; which th’ Almightie seeing,\r\nFrom his transcendent Seat the Saints among,\r\nTo those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.\r\n\r\nSee with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance\r\nTo waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I\r\nSo fair and good created, and had still\r\nKept in that state, had not the folly of Man\r\nLet in these wastful Furies, who impute\r\nFolly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell\r\nAnd his Adherents, that with so much ease\r\nI suffer them to enter and possess\r\nA place so heav’nly, and conniving seem\r\nTo gratifie my scornful Enemies,\r\nThat laugh, as if transported with some fit\r\nOf Passion, I to them had quitted all,\r\nAt random yeilded up to their misrule;\r\nAnd know not that I call’d and drew them thither\r\nMy Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth\r\nWhich mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed\r\nOn what was pure, till cramm’d and gorg’d, nigh burst\r\nWith suckt and glutted offal, at one fling\r\nOf thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,\r\nBoth _Sin_, and _Death_, and yawning _Grave_ at last\r\nThrough _Chaos_ hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell\r\nFor ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.\r\nThen Heav’n and Earth renewd shall be made pure\r\nTo sanctitie that shall receive no staine:\r\nTill then the Curse pronounc’t on both precedes.\r\n\r\nHee ended, and the heav’nly Audience loud\r\nSung _Halleluia_, as the sound of Seas,\r\nThrough multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\r\nRighteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\r\nWho can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\r\nDestin’d restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\nNew Heav’n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\nOr down from Heav’n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\nWhile the Creator calling forth by name\r\nHis mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\nAs sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\nHad first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\nAs might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\nScarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\nDecrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\nSolstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\r\nHer office they prescrib’d, to th’ other five\r\nThir planetarie motions and aspects\r\nIn _Sextile_, _Square_, and _Trine_, and _Opposite_,\r\nOf noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\r\nIn Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\r\nThir influence malignant when to showre,\r\nWhich of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\r\nShould prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\r\nThir corners, when with bluster to confound\r\nSea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\r\nWith terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\r\nSome say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\r\nThe Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\nFrom the Suns Axle; they with labour push’d\r\nOblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\r\nWas bid turn Reines from th’ Equinoctial Rode\r\nLike distant breadth to _Taurus_ with the Seav’n\r\n_Atlantick_ Sisters, and the _Spartan_ Twins\r\nUp to the _Tropic_ Crab; thence down amaine\r\nBy _Leo_ and the _Virgin_ and the _Scales_,\r\nAs deep as _Capricorne_, to bring in change\r\nOf Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\r\nPerpetual smil’d on Earth with vernant Flours,\r\nEqual in Days and Nights, except to those\r\nBeyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\r\nHad unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\r\nTo recompence his distance, in thir sight\r\nHad rounded still th’ _Horizon_, and not known\r\nOr East or West, which had forbid the Snow\r\nFrom cold _Estotiland_, and South as farr\r\nBeneath _Magellan_.  At that tasted Fruit\r\nThe Sun, as from _Thyestean_ Banquet, turn’d\r\nHis course intended; else how had the World\r\nInhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\nAvoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\nThese changes in the Heav’ns, though slow, produc’d\r\nLike change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\nVapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\nCorrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\nOf _Norumbega_, and the _Samoed_ shoar\r\nBursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\nAnd snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n_Boreas_ and _Caecias_ and _Argestes_ loud\r\nAnd _Thrascias_ rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\nWith adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n_Notus_ and _Afer_ black with thundrous Clouds\r\nFrom _Serraliona_; thwart of these as fierce\r\nForth rush the _Levant_ and the _Ponent_ VVindes\r\n_Eurus_ and _Zephir_ with thir lateral noise,\r\n_Sirocco_, and _Libecchio_. Thus began\r\nOutrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\nDaughter of Sin, among th’ irrational,\r\nDeath introduc’d through fierce antipathie:\r\nBeast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\nAnd Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\nDevourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\nOf Man, but fled him, or with count’nance grim\r\nGlar’d on him passing: these were from without\r\nThe growing miseries, which _Adam_ saw\r\nAlreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\nTo sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\nAnd in a troubl’d Sea of passion tost,\r\nThus to disburd’n sought with sad complaint.\r\n\r\nO miserable of happie! is this the end\r\nOf this new glorious World, and mee so late\r\nThe Glory of that Glory, who now becom\r\nAccurst of blessed, hide me from the face\r\nOf God, whom to behold was then my highth\r\nOf happiness: yet well, if here would end\r\nThe miserie, I deserv’d it, and would beare\r\nMy own deservings; but this will not serve;\r\nAll that I eate or drink, or shall beget,\r\nIs propagated curse.  O voice once heard\r\nDelightfully, _Encrease and Multiply_,\r\nNow death to heare! for what can I encrease\r\nOr multiplie, but curses on my head?\r\nWho of all Ages to succeed, but feeling\r\nThe evil on him brought by me, will curse\r\nMy Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,\r\nFor this we may thank _Adam_; but his thanks\r\nShall be the execration; so besides\r\nMine own that bide upon me, all from mee\r\nShall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,\r\nOn mee as on thir natural center light\r\nHeavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes\r\nOf Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!\r\nDid I request thee, Maker, from my Clay\r\nTo mould me Man, did I sollicite thee\r\nFrom darkness to promote me, or here place\r\nIn this delicious Garden? as my Will\r\nConcurd not to my being, it were but right\r\nAnd equal to reduce me to my dust,\r\nDesirous to resigne, and render back\r\nAll I receav’d, unable to performe\r\nThy terms too hard, by which I was to hold\r\nThe good I sought not.  To the loss of that,\r\nSufficient penaltie, why hast thou added\r\nThe sense of endless woes? inexplicable\r\nThy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,\r\nI thus contest; then should have been refusd\r\nThose terms whatever, when they were propos’d:\r\nThou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,\r\nThen cavil the conditions? and though God\r\nMade thee without thy leave, what if thy Son\r\nProve disobedient, and reprov’d, retort,\r\nWherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:\r\nWouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee\r\nThat proud excuse? yet him not thy election,\r\nBut Natural necessity begot.\r\nGod made thee of choice his own, and of his own\r\nTo serve him, thy reward was of his grace,\r\nThy punishment then justly is at his Will.\r\nBe it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,\r\nThat dust I am, and shall to dust returne:\r\nO welcom hour whenever! why delayes\r\nHis hand to execute what his Decree\r\nFixd on this day? why do I overlive,\r\nWhy am I mockt with death, and length’nd out\r\nTo deathless pain? how gladly would I meet\r\nMortalitie my sentence, and be Earth\r\nInsensible, how glad would lay me down\r\nAs in my Mothers lap? there I should rest\r\nAnd sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more\r\nWould Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse\r\nTo mee and to my ofspring would torment me\r\nWith cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt\r\nPursues me still, least all I cannot die,\r\nLeast that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man\r\nWhich God inspir’d, cannot together perish\r\nWith this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,\r\nOr in some other dismal place, who knows\r\nBut I shall die a living Death?  O thought\r\nHorrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath\r\nOf Life that sinn’d; what dies but what had life\r\nAnd sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.\r\nAll of me then shall die: let this appease\r\nThe doubt, since humane reach no further knows.\r\nFor though the Lord of all be infinite,\r\nIs his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,\r\nBut mortal doom’d.  How can he exercise\r\nWrath without end on Man whom Death must end?\r\nCan he make deathless Death? that were to make\r\nStrange contradiction, which to God himself\r\nImpossible is held, as Argument\r\nOf weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,\r\nFor angers sake, finite to infinite\r\nIn punisht man, to satisfie his rigour\r\nSatisfi’d never; that were to extend\r\nHis Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,\r\nBy which all Causes else according still\r\nTo the reception of thir matter act,\r\nNot to th’ extent of thir own Spheare.  But say\r\nThat Death be not one stroak, as I suppos’d,\r\nBereaving sense, but endless miserie\r\nFrom this day onward, which I feel begun\r\nBoth in me, and without me, and so last\r\nTo perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear\r\nComes thundring back with dreadful revolution\r\nOn my defensless head; both Death and I\r\nAm found Eternal, and incorporate both,\r\nNor I on my part single, in mee all\r\nPosteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie\r\nThat I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able\r\nTo waste it all my self, and leave ye none!\r\nSo disinherited how would ye bless\r\nMe now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind\r\nFor one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn’d,\r\nIf guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,\r\nBut all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d,\r\nNot to do onely, but to will the same\r\nWith me? how can they acquitted stand\r\nIn sight of God?  Him after all Disputes\r\nForc’t I absolve: all my evasions vain\r\nAnd reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still\r\nBut to my own conviction: first and last\r\nOn mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring\r\nOf all corruption, all the blame lights due;\r\nSo might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support\r\nThat burden heavier then the Earth to bear,\r\nThen all the world much heavier, though divided\r\nWith that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir’st,\r\nAnd what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope\r\nOf refuge, and concludes thee miserable\r\nBeyond all past example and future,\r\nTo _Satan_ onely like both crime and doom.\r\nO Conscience, into what Abyss of fears\r\nAnd horrors hast thou driv’n me; out of which\r\nI find no way, from deep to deeper plung’d!\r\n\r\nThus _Adam_ to himself lamented loud\r\nThrough the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,\r\nWholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air\r\nAccompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,\r\nWhich to his evil Conscience represented\r\nAll things with double terror: On the ground\r\nOutstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft\r\nCurs’d his Creation, Death as oft accus’d\r\nOf tardie execution, since denounc’t\r\nThe day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,\r\nSaid hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke\r\nTo end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,\r\nJustice Divine not hast’n to be just?\r\nBut Death comes not at call, Justice Divine\r\nMends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.\r\nO Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,\r\nVVith other echo farr I taught your Shades\r\nTo answer, and resound farr other Song.\r\nVVhom thus afflicted when sad _Eve_ beheld,\r\nDesolate where she sate, approaching nigh,\r\nSoft words to his fierce passion she assay’d:\r\nBut her with stern regard he thus repell’d.\r\n\r\nOut of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best\r\nBefits thee with him leagu’d, thy self as false\r\nAnd hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,\r\nLike his, and colour Serpentine may shew\r\nThy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee\r\nHenceforth; least that too heav’nly form, pretended\r\nTo hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee\r\nI had persisted happie, had not thy pride\r\nAnd wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,\r\nRejected my forewarning, and disdain’d\r\nNot to be trusted, longing to be seen\r\nThough by the Devil himself, him overweening\r\nTo over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting\r\nFool’d and beguil’d, by him thou, I by thee,\r\nTo trust thee from my side, imagin’d wise,\r\nConstant, mature, proof against all assaults,\r\nAnd understood not all was but a shew\r\nRather then solid vertu, all but a Rib\r\nCrooked by nature, bent, as now appears,\r\nMore to the part sinister from me drawn,\r\nWell if thrown out, as supernumerarie\r\nTo my just number found.  O why did God,\r\nCreator wise, that peopl’d highest Heav’n\r\nWith Spirits Masculine, create at last\r\nThis noveltie on Earth, this fair defect\r\nOf Nature, and not fill the World at once\r\nWith Men as Angels without Feminine,\r\nOr find some other way to generate\r\nMankind? this mischief had not then befall’n,\r\nAnd more that shall befall, innumerable\r\nDisturbances on Earth through Femal snares,\r\nAnd straight conjunction with this Sex: for either\r\nHe never shall find out fit Mate, but such\r\nAs some misfortune brings him, or mistake,\r\nOr whom he wishes most shall seldom gain\r\nThrough her perverseness, but shall see her gaind\r\nBy a farr worse, or if she love, withheld\r\nBy Parents, or his happiest choice too late\r\nShall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound\r\nTo a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:\r\nWhich infinite calamitie shall cause\r\nTo humane life, and houshold peace confound.\r\n\r\nHe added not, and from her turn’d, but _Eve_\r\nNot so repulst, with Tears that ceas’d not flowing,\r\nAnd tresses all disorderd, at his feet\r\nFell humble, and imbracing them, besaught\r\nHis peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.\r\n\r\nForsake me not thus, _Adam_, witness Heav’n\r\nWhat love sincere, and reverence in my heart\r\nI beare thee, and unweeting have offended,\r\nUnhappilie deceav’d; thy suppliant\r\nI beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,\r\nWhereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,\r\nThy counsel in this uttermost distress,\r\nMy onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,\r\nWhither shall I betake me, where subsist?\r\nWhile yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,\r\nBetween us two let there be peace, both joyning,\r\nAs joyn’d in injuries, one enmitie\r\nAgainst a Foe by doom express assign’d us,\r\nThat cruel Serpent: On me exercise not\r\nThy hatred for this miserie befall’n,\r\nOn me already lost, mee then thy self\r\nMore miserable; both have sin’d, but thou\r\nAgainst God onely, I against God and thee,\r\nAnd to the place of judgement will return,\r\nThere with my cries importune Heaven, that all\r\nThe sentence from thy head remov’d may light\r\nOn me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,\r\nMee mee onely just object of his ire.\r\n\r\nShe ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,\r\nImmoveable till peace obtain’d from fault\r\nAcknowledg’d and deplor’d, in _Adam_ wraught\r\nCommiseration; soon his heart relented\r\nTowards her, his life so late and sole delight,\r\nNow at his feet submissive in distress,\r\nCreature so faire his reconcilement seeking,\r\nHis counsel whom she had displeas’d, his aide;\r\nAs one disarm’d, his anger all he lost,\r\nAnd thus with peaceful words uprais’d her soon.\r\n\r\nUnwarie, and too desirous, as before,\r\nSo now of what thou knowst not, who desir’st\r\nThe punishment all on thy self; alas,\r\nBeare thine own first, ill able to sustaine\r\nHis full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,\r\nAnd my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers\r\nCould alter high Decrees, I to that place\r\nWould speed before thee, and be louder heard,\r\nThat on my head all might be visited,\r\nThy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv’n,\r\nTo me committed and by me expos’d.\r\nBut rise, let us no more contend, nor blame\r\nEach other, blam’d enough elsewhere, but strive\r\nIn offices of Love, how we may light’n\r\nEach others burden in our share of woe;\r\nSince this days Death denounc’t, if ought I see,\r\nWill prove no sudden, but a slow-pac’t evill,\r\nA long days dying to augment our paine,\r\nAnd to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv’d.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Eve_, recovering heart, repli’d.\r\n_Adam_, by sad experiment I know\r\nHow little weight my words with thee can finde,\r\nFound so erroneous, thence by just event\r\nFound so unfortunate; nevertheless,\r\nRestor’d by thee, vile as I am, to place\r\nOf new acceptance, hopeful to regaine\r\nThy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,\r\nLiving or dying from thee I will not hide\r\nWhat thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris’n,\r\nTending to som relief of our extremes,\r\nOr end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,\r\nAs in our evils, and of easier choice.\r\nIf care of our descent perplex us most,\r\nWhich must be born to certain woe, devourd\r\nBy Death at last, and miserable it is\r\nTo be to others cause of misery,\r\nOur own begotten, and of our Loines to bring\r\nInto this cursed World a woful Race,\r\nThat after wretched Life must be at last\r\nFood for so foule a Monster, in thy power\r\nIt lies, yet ere Conception to prevent\r\nThe Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.\r\nChildless thou art, Childless remaine:\r\nSo Death shall be deceav’d his glut, and with us two\r\nBe forc’d to satisfie his Rav’nous Maw.\r\nBut if thou judge it hard and difficult,\r\nConversing, looking, loving, to abstain\r\nFrom Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,\r\nAnd with desire to languish without hope,\r\nBefore the present object languishing\r\nWith like desire, which would be miserie\r\nAnd torment less then none of what we dread,\r\nThen both our selves and Seed at once to free\r\nFrom what we fear for both, let us make short,\r\nLet us seek Death, or hee not found, supply\r\nWith our own hands his Office on our selves;\r\nWhy stand we longer shivering under feares,\r\nThat shew no end but Death, and have the power,\r\nOf many wayes to die the shortest choosing,\r\nDestruction with destruction to destroy.\r\n\r\nShe ended heer, or vehement despaire\r\nBroke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts\r\nHad entertaind, as di’d her Cheeks with pale.\r\nBut _Adam_ with such counsel nothing sway’d,\r\nTo better hopes his more attentive minde\r\nLabouring had rais’d, and thus to _Eve_ repli’d.\r\n\r\n_Eve_, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems\r\nTo argue in thee somthing more sublime\r\nAnd excellent then what thy minde contemnes;\r\nBut self-destruction therefore saught, refutes\r\nThat excellence thought in thee, and implies,\r\nNot thy contempt, but anguish and regret\r\nFor loss of life and pleasure overlov’d.\r\nOr if thou covet death, as utmost end\r\nOf miserie, so thinking to evade\r\nThe penaltie pronounc’t, doubt not but God\r\nHath wiselier arm’d his vengeful ire then so\r\nTo be forestall’d; much more I fear least Death\r\nSo snatcht will not exempt us from the paine\r\nWe are by doom to pay; rather such acts\r\nOf contumacie will provoke the highest\r\nTo make death in us live: Then let us seek\r\nSom safer resolution, which methinks\r\nI have in view, calling to minde with heed\r\nPart of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise\r\nThe Serpents head; piteous amends, unless\r\nBe meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe\r\n_Satan_, who in the Serpent hath contriv’d\r\nAgainst us this deceit: to crush his head\r\nWould be revenge indeed; which will be lost\r\nBy death brought on our selves, or childless days\r\nResolv’d, as thou proposest; so our Foe\r\nShall scape his punishment ordain’d, and wee\r\nInstead shall double ours upon our heads.\r\nNo more be mention’d then of violence\r\nAgainst our selves, and wilful barrenness,\r\nThat cuts us off from hope, and savours onely\r\nRancor and pride, impatience and despite,\r\nReluctance against God and his just yoke\r\nLaid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild\r\nAnd gracious temper he both heard and judg’d\r\nWithout wrauth or reviling; wee expected\r\nImmediate dissolution, which we thought\r\nWas meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee\r\nPains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,\r\nAnd bringing forth, soon recompenc’t with joy,\r\nFruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope\r\nGlanc’d on the ground, with labour I must earne\r\nMy bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;\r\nMy labour will sustain me; and least Cold\r\nOr Heat should injure us, his timely care\r\nHath unbesaught provided, and his hands\r\nCloath’d us unworthie, pitying while he judg’d;\r\nHow much more, if we pray him, will his ear\r\nBe open, and his heart to pitie incline,\r\nAnd teach us further by what means to shun\r\nTh’ inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,\r\nWhich now the Skie with various Face begins\r\nTo shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds\r\nBlow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks\r\nOf these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek\r\nSom better shroud, som better warmth to cherish\r\nOur Limbs benumm’d, ere this diurnal Starr\r\nLeave cold the Night, how we his gather’d beams\r\nReflected, may with matter sere foment,\r\nOr by collision of two bodies grinde\r\nThe Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds\r\nJustling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock\r\nTine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv’n down\r\nKindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,\r\nAnd sends a comfortable heat from farr,\r\nWhich might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,\r\nAnd what may else be remedie or cure\r\nTo evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,\r\nHee will instruct us praying, and of Grace\r\nBeseeching him, so as we need not fear\r\nTo pass commodiously this life, sustain’d\r\nBy him with many comforts, till we end\r\nIn dust, our final rest and native home.\r\nWhat better can we do, then to the place\r\nRepairing where he judg’d us, prostrate fall\r\nBefore him reverent, and there confess\r\nHumbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears\r\nVVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air\r\nFrequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\r\nOf sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.\r\nUndoubtedly he will relent and turn\r\nFrom his displeasure; in whose look serene,\r\nVVhen angry most he seem’d and most severe,\r\nVVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?\r\n\r\nSo spake our Father penitent, nor _Eve_\r\nFelt less remorse: they forthwith to the place\r\nRepairing where he judg’d them prostrate fell\r\nBefore him reverent, and both confess’d\r\nHumbly thir faults, and pardon beg’d, with tears\r\nVVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air\r\nFrequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\r\nOf sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK X.\r\n\r\nThus they in lowliest plight repentant stood\r\nPraying, for from the Mercie-seat above\r\nPrevenient Grace descending had remov’d\r\nThe stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh\r\nRegenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath’d\r\nUnutterable, which the Spirit of prayer\r\nInspir’d, and wing’d for Heav’n with speedier flight\r\nThen loudest Oratorie: yet thir port\r\nNot of mean suiters, nor important less\r\nSeem’d thir Petition, then when th’ ancient Pair\r\nIn Fables old, less ancient yet then these,\r\n_Deucalion_ and chaste _Pyrrha_ to restore\r\nThe Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine\r\nOf _Themis_ stood devout.  To Heav’n thir prayers\r\nFlew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes\r\nBlow’n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd\r\nDimentionless through Heav’nly dores; then clad\r\nWith incense, where the Golden Altar fum’d,\r\nBy thir great Intercessor, came in sight\r\nBefore the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son\r\nPresenting, thus to intercede began.\r\n\r\nSee Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung\r\nFrom thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs\r\nAnd Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt\r\nWith Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,\r\nFruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed\r\nSow’n with contrition in his heart, then those\r\nWhich his own hand manuring all the Trees\r\nOf Paradise could have produc’t, ere fall’n\r\nFrom innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare\r\nTo supplication, heare his sighs though mute;\r\nUnskilful with what words to pray, let mee\r\nInterpret for him, mee his Advocate\r\nAnd propitiation, all his works on mee\r\nGood or not good ingraft, my Merit those\r\nShall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.\r\nAccept me, and in mee from these receave\r\nThe smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live\r\nBefore thee reconcil’d, at least his days\r\nNumberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I\r\nTo mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)\r\nTo better life shall yeeld him, where with mee\r\nAll my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,\r\nMade one with me as I with thee am one.\r\n\r\nTo whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.\r\nAll thy request for Man, accepted Son,\r\nObtain, all thy request was my Decree:\r\nBut longer in that Paradise to dwell,\r\nThe Law I gave to Nature him forbids:\r\nThose pure immortal Elements that know\r\nNo gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,\r\nEject him tainted now, and purge him off\r\nAs a distemper, gross to aire as gross,\r\nAnd mortal food, as may dispose him best\r\nFor dissolution wrought by Sin, that first\r\nDistemperd all things, and of incorrupt\r\nCorrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts\r\nCreated him endowd, with Happiness\r\nAnd Immortalitie: that fondly lost,\r\nThis other serv’d but to eternize woe;\r\nTill I provided Death; so Death becomes\r\nHis final remedie, and after Life\r\nTri’d in sharp tribulation, and refin’d\r\nBy Faith and faithful works, to second Life,\r\nWak’t in the renovation of the just,\r\nResignes him up with Heav’n and Earth renewd.\r\nBut let us call to Synod all the Blest\r\nThrough Heav’ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide\r\nMy judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,\r\nAs how with peccant Angels late they saw;\r\nAnd in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.\r\n\r\nHe ended, and the Son gave signal high\r\nTo the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew\r\nHis Trumpet, heard in _Oreb_ since perhaps\r\nWhen God descended, and perhaps once more\r\nTo sound at general Doom.  Th’ Angelic blast\r\nFilld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs\r\nOf _Amarantin_ Shade, Fountain or Spring,\r\nBy the waters of Life, where ere they sate\r\nIn fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light\r\nHasted, resorting to the Summons high,\r\nAnd took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream\r\nTh’ Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.\r\n\r\nO Sons, like one of us Man is become\r\nTo know both Good and Evil, since his taste\r\nOf that defended Fruit; but let him boast\r\nHis knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,\r\nHappier, had it suffic’d him to have known\r\nGood by it self, and Evil not at all.\r\nHe sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,\r\nMy motions in him, longer then they move,\r\nHis heart I know, how variable and vain\r\nSelf-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand\r\nReach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,\r\nAnd live for ever, dream at least to live\r\nForever, to remove him I decree,\r\nAnd send him from the Garden forth to Till\r\nThe Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.\r\n\r\n_Michael_, this my behest have thou in charge,\r\nTake to thee from among the Cherubim\r\nThy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend\r\nOr in behalf of Man, or to invade\r\nVacant possession som new trouble raise:\r\nHast thee, and from the Paradise of God\r\nWithout remorse drive out the sinful Pair,\r\nFrom hallowd ground th’ unholie, and denounce\r\nTo them and to thir Progenie from thence\r\nPerpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint\r\nAt the sad Sentence rigorously urg’d,\r\nFor I behold them soft’nd and with tears\r\nBewailing thir excess, all terror hide.\r\nIf patiently thy bidding they obey,\r\nDismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\r\nTo _Adam_ what shall come in future dayes,\r\nAs I shall thee enlighten, intermix\r\nMy Cov’nant in the Womans seed renewd;\r\nSo send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:\r\nAnd on the East side of the Garden place,\r\nWhere entrance up from _Eden_ easiest climbes,\r\nCherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame\r\nWide waving, all approach farr off to fright,\r\nAnd guard all passage to the Tree of Life:\r\nLeast Paradise a receptacle prove\r\nTo Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,\r\nWith whose stol’n Fruit Man once more to delude.\r\n\r\nHe ceas’d; and th’ Archangelic Power prepar’d\r\nFor swift descent, with him the Cohort bright\r\nOf watchful Cherubim; four faces each\r\nHad, like a double _Janus_, all thir shape\r\nSpangl’d with eyes more numerous then those\r\nOf _Argus_, and more wakeful then to drouze,\r\nCharm’d with _Arcadian_ Pipe, the Pastoral Reed\r\nOf _Hermes_, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile\r\nTo resalute the World with sacred Light\r\n_Leucothea_ wak’d, and with fresh dews imbalmd\r\nThe Earth, when _Adam_ and first Matron _Eve_\r\nHad ended now thir Orisons, and found,\r\nStrength added from above, new hope to spring\r\nOut of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;\r\nWhich thus to _Eve_ his welcome words renewd.\r\n\r\n_Eve_, easily may Faith admit, that all\r\nThe good which we enjoy, from Heav’n descends\r\nBut that from us ought should ascend to Heav’n\r\nSo prevalent as to concerne the mind\r\nOf God high blest, or to incline his will,\r\nHard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,\r\nOr one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne\r\nEv’n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught\r\nBy Prayer th’ offended Deitie to appease,\r\nKneel’d and before him humbl’d all my heart,\r\nMethought I saw him placable and mild,\r\nBending his eare; perswasion in me grew\r\nThat I was heard with favour; peace returnd\r\nHome to my brest, and to my memorie\r\nHis promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;\r\nWhich then not minded in dismay, yet now\r\nAssures me that the bitterness of death\r\nIs past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,\r\n_Eve_ rightly call’d, Mother of all Mankind,\r\nMother of all things living, since by thee\r\nMan is to live, and all things live for Man.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Eve_ with sad demeanour meek.\r\nIll worthie I such title should belong\r\nTo me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\r\nA help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\r\nRather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\r\nBut infinite in pardon was my Judge,\r\nThat I who first brought Death on all, am grac’t\r\nThe sourse of life; next favourable thou,\r\nWho highly thus to entitle me voutsaf’t,\r\nFarr other name deserving.  But the Field\r\nTo labour calls us now with sweat impos’d,\r\nThough after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\r\nAll unconcern’d with our unrest, begins\r\nHer rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\r\nI never from thy side henceforth to stray,\r\nWherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\r\nLaborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\r\nWhat can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\r\nHere let us live, though in fall’n state, content.\r\n\r\nSo spake, so wish’d much-humbl’d _Eve_, but Fate\r\nSubscrib’d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest\r\nOn Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips’d\r\nAfter short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight\r\nThe Bird of _Jove_, stoopt from his aerie tour,\r\nTwo Birds of gayest plume before him drove:\r\nDown from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,\r\nFirst Hunter then, pursu’d a gentle brace,\r\nGoodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;\r\nDirect to th’ Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.\r\n_Adam_ observ’d, and with his Eye the chase\r\nPursuing, not unmov’d to _Eve_ thus spake.\r\n\r\nO _Eve_, some furder change awaits us nigh,\r\nWhich Heav’n by these mute signs in Nature shews\r\nForerunners of his purpose, or to warn\r\nUs haply too secure of our discharge\r\nFrom penaltie, because from death releast\r\nSome days; how long, and what till then our life,\r\nWho knows, or more then this, that we are dust,\r\nAnd thither must return and be no more.\r\nVVhy else this double object in our sight\r\nOf flight pursu’d in th’ Air and ore the ground\r\nOne way the self-same hour? why in the East\r\nDarkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light\r\nMore orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws\r\nO’re the blew Firmament a radiant white,\r\nAnd slow descends, with somthing heav’nly fraught.\r\n\r\nHe err’d not, for by this the heav’nly Bands\r\nDown from a Skie of Jasper lighted now\r\nIn Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,\r\nA glorious Apparition, had not doubt\r\nAnd carnal fear that day dimm’d _Adams_ eye.\r\nNot that more glorious, when the Angels met\r\n_Jacob_ in _Mahanaim_, where he saw\r\nThe field Pavilion’d with his Guardians bright;\r\nNor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd\r\nIn _Dothan_, cover’d with a Camp of Fire,\r\nAgainst the _Syrian_ King, who to surprize\r\nOne man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,\r\nWarr unproclam’d.  The Princely Hierarch\r\nIn thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise\r\nPossession of the Garden; hee alone,\r\nTo finde where _Adam_ shelterd, took his way,\r\nNot unperceav’d of _Adam_, who to _Eve_,\r\nWhile the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.\r\n\r\n_Eve_, now expect great tidings, which perhaps\r\nOf us will soon determin, or impose\r\nNew Laws to be observ’d; for I descrie\r\nFrom yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill\r\nOne of the heav’nly Host, and by his Gate\r\nNone of the meanest, some great Potentate\r\nOr of the Thrones above, such Majestie\r\nInvests him coming; yet not terrible,\r\nThat I should fear, nor sociably mild,\r\nAs _Raphael_, that I should much confide,\r\nBut solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,\r\nWith reverence I must meet, and thou retire.\r\nHe ended; and th’ Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,\r\nNot in his shape Celestial, but as Man\r\nClad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes\r\nA militarie Vest of purple flowd\r\nLivelier then _Meliboean_, or the graine\r\nOf _Sarra_, worn by Kings and Hero’s old\r\nIn time of Truce; _Iris_ had dipt the wooff;\r\nHis starrie Helme unbuckl’d shew’d him prime\r\nIn Manhood where Youth ended; by his side\r\nAs in a glistering _Zodiac_ hung the Sword,\r\nSatans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.\r\n_Adam_ bowd low, hee Kingly from his State\r\nInclin’d not, but his coming thus declar’d.\r\n\r\n_Adam_, Heav’ns high behest no Preface needs:\r\nSufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,\r\nThen due by sentence when thou didst transgress,\r\nDefeated of his seisure many dayes\r\nGiv’n thee of Grace, wherein thou may’st repent,\r\nAnd one bad act with many deeds well done\r\nMayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas’d\r\nRedeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;\r\nBut longer in this Paradise to dwell\r\nPermits not; to remove thee I am come,\r\nAnd send thee from the Garden forth to till\r\nThe ground whence thou wast tak’n, fitter Soile.\r\n\r\nHe added not, for _Adam_ at the newes\r\nHeart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,\r\nThat all his senses bound; _Eve_, who unseen\r\nYet all had heard, with audible lament\r\nDiscover’d soon the place of her retire.\r\n\r\nO unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!\r\nMust I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave\r\nThee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,\r\nFit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,\r\nQuiet though sad, the respit of that day\r\nThat must be mortal to us both.  O flours,\r\nThat never will in other Climate grow,\r\nMy early visitation, and my last\r\nAt Eev’n, which I bred up with tender hand\r\nFrom the first op’ning bud, and gave ye Names,\r\nWho now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke\r\nYour Tribes, and water from th’ ambrosial Fount?\r\nThee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd\r\nWith what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee\r\nHow shall I part, and whither wander down\r\nInto a lower World, to this obscure\r\nAnd wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire\r\nLess pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?\r\n\r\nWhom thus the Angel interrupted milde.\r\nLament not _Eve_, but patiently resigne\r\nWhat justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,\r\nThus over fond, on that which is not thine;\r\nThy going is not lonely, with thee goes\r\nThy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;\r\nWhere he abides, think there thy native soile.\r\n\r\n_Adam_ by this from the cold sudden damp\r\nRecovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,\r\nTo _Michael_ thus his humble words addressd.\r\n\r\nCelestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam’d\r\nOf them the Highest, for such of shape may seem\r\nPrince above Princes, gently hast thou tould\r\nThy message, which might else in telling wound,\r\nAnd in performing end us; what besides\r\nOf sorrow and dejection and despair\r\nOur frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,\r\nDeparture from this happy place, our sweet\r\nRecess, and onely consolation left\r\nFamiliar to our eyes, all places else\r\nInhospitable appeer and desolate,\r\nNor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer\r\nIncessant I could hope to change the will\r\nOf him who all things can, I would not cease\r\nTo wearie him with my assiduous cries:\r\nBut prayer against his absolute Decree\r\nNo more availes then breath against the winde,\r\nBlown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:\r\nTherefore to his great bidding I submit.\r\nThis most afflicts me, that departing hence,\r\nAs from his face I shall be hid, deprivd\r\nHis blessed count’nance; here I could frequent,\r\nWith worship, place by place where he voutsaf’d\r\nPresence Divine, and to my Sons relate;\r\nOn this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree\r\nStood visible, among these Pines his voice\r\nI heard, here with him at this Fountain talk’d:\r\nSo many grateful Altars I would reare\r\nOf grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone\r\nOf lustre from the brook, in memorie,\r\nOr monument to Ages, and thereon\r\nOffer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:\r\nIn yonder nether World where shall I seek\r\nHis bright appearances, or footstep trace?\r\nFor though I fled him angrie, yet recall’d\r\nTo life prolongd and promisd Race, I now\r\nGladly behold though but his utmost skirts\r\nOf glory, and farr off his steps adore.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_ with regard benigne.\r\n_Adam_, thou know’st Heav’n his, and all the Earth\r\nNot this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills\r\nLand, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,\r\nFomented by his virtual power and warmd:\r\nAll th’ Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,\r\nNo despicable gift; surmise not then\r\nHis presence to these narrow bounds confin’d\r\nOf Paradise or _Eden_: this had been\r\nPerhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred\r\nAll generations, and had hither come\r\nFrom all the ends of th’ Earth, to celebrate\r\nAnd reverence thee thir great Progenitor.\r\nBut this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down\r\nTo dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:\r\nYet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine\r\nGod is as here, and will be found alike\r\nPresent, and of his presence many a signe\r\nStill following thee, still compassing thee round\r\nWith goodness and paternal Love, his Face\r\nExpress, and of his steps the track Divine.\r\nWhich that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,\r\nEre thou from hence depart, know I am sent\r\nTo shew thee what shall come in future dayes\r\nTo thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad\r\nExpect to hear, supernal Grace contending\r\nWith sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn\r\nTrue patience, and to temper joy with fear\r\nAnd pious sorrow, equally enur’d\r\nBy moderation either state to beare,\r\nProsperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead\r\nSafest thy life, and best prepar’d endure\r\nThy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend\r\nThis Hill; let _Eve_ (for I have drencht her eyes)\r\nHere sleep below while thou to foresight wak’st,\r\nAs once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Adam_ gratefully repli’d.\r\nAscend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path\r\nThou lead’st me, and to the hand of Heav’n submit,\r\nHowever chast’ning, to the evil turne\r\nMy obvious breast, arming to overcom\r\nBy suffering, and earne rest from labour won,\r\nIf so I may attain.  So both ascend\r\nIn the Visions of God:  It was a Hill\r\nOf Paradise the highest, from whose top\r\nThe Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken\r\nStretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.\r\nNot higher that Hill nor wider looking round,\r\nWhereon for different cause the Tempter set\r\nOur second _Adam_ in the Wilderness,\r\nTo shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.\r\nHis Eye might there command wherever stood\r\nCity of old or modern Fame, the Seat\r\nOf mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls\r\nOf _Cambalu_, seat of _Cathaian Can_\r\nAnd _Samarchand_ by _Oxus_, _Temirs_ Throne,\r\nTo _Paquin_ of _Sinaean_ Kings, and thence\r\nTo _Agra_ and _Lahor_ of great _Mogul_\r\nDown to the golden _Chersones_, or where\r\nThe _Persian_ in _Ecbatan_ sate, or since\r\nIn _Hispahan_, or where the _Russian Ksar_\r\nIn _Mosco_, or the Sultan in _Bizance_,\r\n_Turchestan_-born; nor could his eye not ken\r\nTh’ Empire of _Negus_ to his utmost Port\r\n_Ercoco_ and the less Maritine Kings\r\n_Mombaza_, and _Quiloa_, and _Melind_,\r\nAnd _Sofala_ thought _Ophir_, to the Realme\r\nOf _Congo_, and _Angola_ fardest South;\r\nOr thence from _Niger_ Flood to _Atlas_ Mount\r\nThe Kingdoms of _Almansor_, _Fez_, and _Sus_,\r\n_Marocco_ and _Algiers_, and _Tremisen_;\r\nOn _Europe_ thence, and where _Rome_ was to sway\r\nThe VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw\r\nRich _Mexico_ the seat of _Motezume_,\r\nAnd _Cusco_ in _Peru_, the richer seat\r\nOf _Atabalipa_, and yet unspoil’d\r\n_Guiana_, whose great Citie _Geryons_ Sons\r\nCall _El Dorado:_ but to nobler sights\r\n_Michael_ from _Adams_ eyes the Filme remov’d\r\nVVhich that false Fruit that promis’d clearer sight\r\nHad bred; then purg’d with Euphrasie and Rue\r\nThe visual Nerve, for he had much to see;\r\nAnd from the VVell of Life three drops instill’d.\r\nSo deep the power of these Ingredients pierc’d,\r\nEevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,\r\nThat _Adam_ now enforc’t to close his eyes,\r\nSunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:\r\nBut him the gentle Angel by the hand\r\nSoon rais’d, and his attention thus recall’d.\r\n\r\n_Adam_, now ope thine eyes, and first behold\r\nTh’ effects which thy original crime hath wrought\r\nIn some to spring from thee, who never touch’d\r\nTh’ excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir’d,\r\nNor sinn’d thy sin, yet from that sin derive\r\nCorruption to bring forth more violent deeds.\r\n\r\nHis eyes he op’nd, and beheld a field,\r\nPart arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves\r\nNew reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;\r\nIth’ midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood\r\nRustic, of grassie sord; thither anon\r\nA sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought\r\nFirst Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,\r\nUncull’d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next\r\nMore meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock\r\nChoicest and best; then sacrificing, laid\r\nThe Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew’d,\r\nOn the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform’d.\r\nHis Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav’n\r\nConsum’d with nimble glance, and grateful steame;\r\nThe others not, for his was not sincere;\r\nWhereat hee inlie rag’d, and as they talk’d,\r\nSmote him into the Midriff with a stone\r\nThat beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale\r\nGroand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus’d.\r\nMuch at that sight was _Adam_ in his heart\r\nDismai’d, and thus in haste to th’ Angel cri’d.\r\n\r\nO Teacher, some great mischief hath befall’n\r\nTo that meek man, who well had sacrific’d;\r\nIs Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?\r\n\r\nT’ whom _Michael_ thus, hee also mov’d, repli’d.\r\nThese two are Brethren, _Adam_, and to come\r\nOut of thy loyns; th’ unjust the just hath slain,\r\nFor envie that his Brothers Offering found\r\nFrom Heav’n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact\r\nWill be aveng’d, and th’ others Faith approv’d\r\nLoose no reward, though here thou see him die,\r\nRowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire.\r\n\r\nAlas, both for the deed and for the cause!\r\nBut have I now seen Death?  Is this the way\r\nI must return to native dust?  O sight\r\nOf terrour, foul and ugly to behold,\r\nHorrid to think, how horrible to feel!\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Death thou hast seen\r\nIn his first shape on man; but many shapes\r\nOf Death, and many are the wayes that lead\r\nTo his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\r\nMore terrible at th’ entrance then within.\r\nSome, as thou saw’st, by violent stroke shall die,\r\nBy Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\r\nIn Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring\r\nDiseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\r\nBefore thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\r\nWhat miserie th’ inabstinence of _Eve_\r\nShall bring on men.  Immediately a place\r\nBefore his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\r\nA Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\r\nNumbers of all diseas’d, all maladies\r\nOf gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\r\nOf heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\r\nConvulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\r\nIntestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\r\nDropsies, and Asthma’s, and Joint-racking Rheums.\r\nDire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\r\nTended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\r\nAnd over them triumphant Death his Dart\r\nShook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok’t\r\nWith vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\r\nSight so deform what heart of Rock could long\r\nDrie-ey’d behold?  _Adam_ could not, but wept,\r\nThough not of Woman born; compassion quell’d\r\nHis best of Man, and gave him up to tears\r\nA space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\r\nAnd scarce recovering words his plaint renew’d.\r\n\r\nO miserable Mankind, to what fall\r\nDegraded, to what wretched state reserv’d?\r\nBetter end heer unborn.  Why is life giv’n\r\nTo be thus wrested from us? rather why\r\nObtruded on us thus? who if we knew\r\nWhat we receive, would either not accept\r\nLife offer’d, or soon beg to lay it down,\r\nGlad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus\r\nTh’ Image of God in man created once\r\nSo goodly and erect, though faultie since,\r\nTo such unsightly sufferings be debas’t\r\nUnder inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,\r\nRetaining still Divine similitude\r\nIn part, from such deformities be free,\r\nAnd for his Makers Image sake exempt?\r\n\r\nThir Makers Image, answerd _Michael_, then\r\nForsook them, when themselves they villifi’d\r\nTo serve ungovern’d appetite, and took\r\nHis Image whom they serv’d, a brutish vice,\r\nInductive mainly to the sin of _Eve_.\r\nTherefore so abject is thir punishment,\r\nDisfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,\r\nOr if his likeness, by themselves defac’t\r\nWhile they pervert pure Natures healthful rules\r\nTo loathsom sickness, worthily, since they\r\nGods Image did not reverence in themselves.\r\n\r\nI yeild it just, said _Adam_, and submit.\r\nBut is there yet no other way, besides\r\nThese painful passages, how we may come\r\nTo Death, and mix with our connatural dust?\r\n\r\nThere is, said _Michael_, if thou well observe\r\nThe rule of not too much, by temperance taught\r\nIn what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence\r\nDue nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\r\nTill many years over thy head return:\r\nSo maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop\r\nInto thy Mothers lap, or be with ease\r\nGatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:\r\nThis is old age; but then thou must outlive\r\nThy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change\r\nTo witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then\r\nObtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,\r\nTo what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth\r\nHopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne\r\nA melancholly damp of cold and dry\r\nTo waigh thy spirits down, and last consume\r\nThe Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.\r\n\r\nHenceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong\r\nLife much, bent rather how I may be quit\r\nFairest and easiest of this combrous charge,\r\nWhich I must keep till my appointed day\r\nOf rendring up.  _Michael_ to him repli’d.\r\n\r\nNor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst\r\nLive well, how long or short permit to Heav’n:\r\nAnd now prepare thee for another sight.\r\n\r\nHe lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon\r\nWere Tents of various hue; by some were herds\r\nOf Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound\r\nOf Instruments that made melodious chime\r\nWas heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd\r\nThir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch\r\nInstinct through all proportions low and high\r\nFled and pursu’d transverse the resonant fugue.\r\nIn other part stood one who at the Forge\r\nLabouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass\r\nHad melted (whether found where casual fire\r\nHad wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,\r\nDown to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot\r\nTo som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream\r\nFrom underground) the liquid Ore he dreind\r\nInto fit moulds prepar’d; from which he formd\r\nFirst his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought\r\nFulfil or grav’n in mettle.  After these,\r\nBut on the hether side a different sort\r\nFrom the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,\r\nDown to the Plain descended: by thir guise\r\nJust men they seemd, and all thir study bent\r\nTo worship God aright, and know his works\r\nNot hid, nor those things lost which might preserve\r\nFreedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain\r\nLong had not walkt, when from the Tents behold\r\nA Beavie of fair Women, richly gay\r\nIn Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung\r\nSoft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:\r\nThe Men though grave, ey’d them, and let thir eyes\r\nRove without rein, till in the amorous Net\r\nFast caught, they lik’d, and each his liking chose;\r\nAnd now of love they treat till th’ Eevning Star\r\nLoves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat\r\nThey light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke\r\nHymen, then first to marriage Rites invok’t;\r\nWith Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.\r\nSuch happy interview and fair event\r\nOf love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,\r\nAnd charming Symphonies attach’d the heart\r\nOf _Adam_, soon enclin’d to admit delight,\r\nThe bent of Nature; which he thus express’d.\r\n\r\nTrue opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,\r\nMuch better seems this Vision, and more hope\r\nOf peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;\r\nThose were of hate and death, or pain much worse,\r\nHere Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Judg not what is best\r\nBy pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\r\nCreated, as thou art, to nobler end\r\nHolie and pure, conformitie divine.\r\nThose Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\r\nOf wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\r\nWho slew his Brother; studious they appere\r\nOf Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\r\nUnmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\r\nTaught them, but they his gifts acknowledg’d none.\r\nYet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\r\nFor that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\r\nOf Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\r\nYet empty of all good wherein consists\r\nWomans domestic honour and chief praise;\r\nBred onely and completed to the taste\r\nOf lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,\r\nTo dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\r\nTo these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\r\nReligious titl’d them the Sons of God,\r\nShall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame\r\nIgnobly, to the trains and to the smiles\r\nOf these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\r\n(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which\r\nThe world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Adam_ of short joy bereft.\r\nO pittie and shame, that they who to live well\r\nEnterd so faire, should turn aside to tread\r\nPaths indirect, or in the mid way faint!\r\nBut still I see the tenor of Mans woe\r\nHolds on the same, from Woman to begin.\r\n\r\nFrom Mans effeminate slackness it begins,\r\nSaid th’ Angel, who should better hold his place\r\nBy wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.\r\nBut now prepare thee for another Scene.\r\n\r\nHe lookd and saw wide Territorie spred\r\nBefore him, Towns, and rural works between,\r\nCities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,\r\nConcours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,\r\nGiants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;\r\nPart wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,\r\nSingle or in Array of Battel rang’d\r\nBoth Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;\r\nOne way a Band select from forage drives\r\nA herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine\r\nFrom a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,\r\nEwes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,\r\nThir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,\r\nBut call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;\r\nWith cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;\r\nWhere Cattel pastur’d late, now scatterd lies\r\nWith Carcasses and Arms th’ ensanguind Field\r\nDeserted: Others to a Citie strong\r\nLay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,\r\nAssaulting; others from the Wall defend\r\nWith Dart and Jav’lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;\r\nOn each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.\r\nIn other part the scepter’d Haralds call\r\nTo Council in the Citie Gates: anon\r\nGrey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,\r\nAssemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon\r\nIn factious opposition, till at last\r\nOf middle Age one rising, eminent\r\nIn wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,\r\nOf Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,\r\nAnd Judgement from above: him old and young\r\nExploded, and had seiz’d with violent hands,\r\nHad not a Cloud descending snatch’d him thence\r\nUnseen amid the throng: so violence\r\nProceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law\r\nThrough all the Plain, and refuge none was found.\r\n_Adam_ was all in tears, and to his guide\r\nLamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,\r\nDeaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death\r\nInhumanly to men, and multiply\r\nTen thousand fould the sin of him who slew\r\nHis Brother; for of whom such massacher\r\nMake they but of thir Brethren, men of men?\r\nBut who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav’n\r\nRescu’d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_; These are the product\r\nOf those ill-mated Marriages thou saw’st;\r\nWhere good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\r\nAbhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\r\nProduce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\r\nSuch were these Giants, men of high renown;\r\nFor in those dayes Might onely shall be admir’d,\r\nAnd Valour and Heroic Vertu call’d;\r\nTo overcome in Battel, and subdue\r\nNations, and bring home spoils with infinite\r\nMan-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\r\nOf human Glorie, and for Glorie done\r\nOf triumph, to be styl’d great Conquerours,\r\nPatrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\r\nDestroyers rightlier call’d and Plagues of men.\r\nThus Fame shall be achiev’d, renown on Earth,\r\nAnd what most merits fame in silence hid.\r\nBut hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\r\nThe onely righteous in a World perverse,\r\nAnd therefore hated, therefore so beset\r\nWith Foes for daring single to be just,\r\nAnd utter odious Truth, that God would come\r\nTo judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\r\nRapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\r\nDid, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\r\nHigh in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\r\nExempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\r\nAwaits the good, the rest what punishment;\r\nWhich now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\r\n\r\nHe look’d, & saw the face of things quite chang’d;\r\nThe brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,\r\nAll now was turn’d to jollitie and game,\r\nTo luxurie and riot, feast and dance,\r\nMarrying or prostituting, as befell,\r\nRape or Adulterie, where passing faire\r\nAllurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.\r\nAt length a Reverend Sire among them came,\r\nAnd of thir doings great dislike declar’d,\r\nAnd testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft\r\nFrequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,\r\nTriumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd\r\nConversion and Repentance, as to Souls\r\nIn prison under Judgements imminent:\r\nBut all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas’d\r\nContending, and remov’d his Tents farr off;\r\nThen from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,\r\nBegan to build a Vessel of huge bulk,\r\nMeasur’d by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,\r\nSmeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore\r\nContriv’d, and of provisions laid in large\r\nFor Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!\r\nOf everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small\r\nCame seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught\r\nThir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons\r\nWith thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.\r\nMeanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings\r\nWide hovering, all the Clouds together drove\r\nFrom under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie\r\nVapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,\r\nSent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie\r\nLike a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain\r\nImpetuous, and continu’d till the Earth\r\nNo more was seen; the floating Vessel swum\r\nUplifted; and secure with beaked prow\r\nRode tilting o’re the Waves, all dwellings else\r\nFlood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp\r\nDeep under water rould; Sea cover’d Sea,\r\nSea without shoar; and in thir Palaces\r\nWhere luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d\r\nAnd stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,\r\nAll left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t.\r\nHow didst thou grieve then, _Adam_, to behold\r\nThe end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,\r\nDepopulation; thee another Floud,\r\nOf tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,\r\nAnd sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard\r\nBy th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,\r\nThough comfortless, as when a Father mourns\r\nHis Childern, all in view destroyd at once;\r\nAnd scarce to th’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.\r\n\r\nO Visions ill foreseen! better had I\r\nLiv’d ignorant of future, so had borne\r\nMy part of evil onely, each dayes lot\r\nAnough to bear; those now, that were dispenst\r\nThe burd’n of many Ages, on me light\r\nAt once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth\r\nAbortive, to torment me ere thir being,\r\nWith thought that they must be.  Let no man seek\r\nHenceforth to be foretold what shall befall\r\nHim or his Childern, evil he may be sure,\r\nWhich neither his foreknowing can prevent,\r\nAnd hee the future evil shall no less\r\nIn apprehension then in substance feel\r\nGrievous to bear: but that care now is past,\r\nMan is not whom to warne: those few escap’t\r\nFamin and anguish will at last consume\r\nWandring that watrie Desert: I had hope\r\nWhen violence was ceas’t, and Warr on Earth,\r\nAll would have then gon well, peace would have crownd\r\nWith length of happy days the race of man;\r\nBut I was farr deceav’d; for now I see\r\nPeace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.\r\nHow comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,\r\nAnd whether here the Race of man will end.\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Those whom last thou sawst\r\nIn triumph and luxurious wealth, are they\r\nFirst seen in acts of prowess eminent\r\nAnd great exploits, but of true vertu void;\r\nWho having spilt much blood, and don much waste\r\nSubduing Nations, and achievd thereby\r\nFame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,\r\nShall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,\r\nSurfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride\r\nRaise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.\r\nThe conquerd also, and enslav’d by Warr\r\nShall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose\r\nAnd feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign’d\r\nIn sharp contest of Battel found no aide\r\nAgainst invaders; therefore coold in zeale\r\nThenceforth shall practice how to live secure,\r\nWorldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords\r\nShall leave them to enjoy; for th’ Earth shall bear\r\nMore then anough, that temperance may be tri’d:\r\nSo all shall turn degenerate, all deprav’d,\r\nJustice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;\r\nOne Man except, the onely Son of light\r\nIn a dark Age, against example good,\r\nAgainst allurement, custom, and a World\r\nOffended; fearless of reproach and scorn,\r\nOr violence, hee of thir wicked wayes\r\nShall them admonish, and before them set\r\nThe paths of righteousness, how much more safe,\r\nAnd full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come\r\nOn thir impenitence; and shall returne\r\nOf them derided, but of God observd\r\nThe one just Man alive; by his command\r\nShall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,\r\nTo save himself and houshold from amidst\r\nA World devote to universal rack.\r\nNo sooner hee with them of Man and Beast\r\nSelect for life shall in the Ark be lodg’d,\r\nAnd shelterd round, but all the Cataracts\r\nOf Heav’n set open on the Earth shall powre\r\nRaine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep\r\nBroke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp\r\nBeyond all bounds, till inundation rise\r\nAbove the highest Hills: then shall this Mount\r\nOf Paradise by might of Waves be moovd\r\nOut of his place, pushd by the horned floud,\r\nWith all his verdure spoil’d, and Trees adrift\r\nDown the great River to the op’ning Gulf,\r\nAnd there take root an Iland salt and bare,\r\nThe haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.\r\nTo teach thee that God attributes to place\r\nNo sanctitie, if none be thither brought\r\nBy Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.\r\nAnd now what further shall ensue, behold.\r\n\r\nHe lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,\r\nWhich now abated, for the Clouds were fled,\r\nDrivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie\r\nWrinkl’d the face of Deluge, as decai’d;\r\nAnd the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass\r\nGaz’d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,\r\nAs after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink\r\nFrom standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole\r\nWith soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt\r\nHis Sluces, as the Heav’n his windows shut.\r\nThe Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground\r\nFast on the top of som high mountain fixt.\r\nAnd now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;\r\nWith clamor thence the rapid Currents drive\r\nTowards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.\r\nForthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,\r\nAnd after him, the surer messenger,\r\nA Dove sent forth once and agen to spie\r\nGreen Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;\r\nThe second time returning, in his Bill\r\nAn Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:\r\nAnon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke\r\nThe ancient Sire descends with all his Train;\r\nThen with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,\r\nGrateful to Heav’n, over his head beholds\r\nA dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow\r\nConspicuous with three lifted colours gay,\r\nBetok’ning peace from God, and Cov’nant new.\r\nWhereat the heart of _Adam_ erst so sad\r\nGreatly rejoyc’d, and thus his joy broke forth.\r\n\r\nO thou that future things canst represent\r\nAs present, Heav’nly instructer, I revive\r\nAt this last sight, assur’d that Man shall live\r\nWith all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.\r\nFarr less I now lament for one whole World\r\nOf wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce\r\nFor one Man found so perfet and so just,\r\nThat God voutsafes to raise another World\r\nFrom him, and all his anger to forget.\r\nBut say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,\r\nDistended as the Brow of God appeas’d,\r\nOr serve they as a flourie verge to binde\r\nThe fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,\r\nLeast it again dissolve and showr the Earth?\r\n\r\nTo whom th’ Archangel.  Dextrously thou aim’st;\r\nSo willingly doth God remit his Ire,\r\nThough late repenting him of Man deprav’d,\r\nGriev’d at his heart, when looking down he saw\r\nThe whole Earth fill’d with violence, and all flesh\r\nCorrupting each thir way; yet those remoov’d,\r\nSuch grace shall one just Man find in his sight,\r\nThat he relents, not to blot out mankind,\r\nAnd makes a Covenant never to destroy\r\nThe Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea\r\nSurpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World\r\nWith Man therein or Beast; but when he brings\r\nOver the Earth a Cloud, will therein set\r\nHis triple-colour’d Bow, whereon to look\r\nAnd call to mind his Cov’nant: Day and Night,\r\nSeed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost\r\nShall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,\r\nBoth Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.\r\nThus thou hast seen one World begin and end;\r\nAnd Man as from a second stock proceed.\r\nMuch thou hast yet to see, but I perceave\r\nThy mortal sight to faile; objects divine\r\nMust needs impaire and wearie human sense:\r\nHenceforth what is to com I will relate,\r\nThou therefore give due audience, and attend.\r\nThis second sours of Men, while yet but few,\r\nAnd while the dread of judgement past remains\r\nFresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,\r\nWith some regard to what is just and right\r\nShall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,\r\nLabouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,\r\nCorn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,\r\nOft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,\r\nWith large Wine-offerings pour’d, and sacred Feast\r\nShal spend thir dayes in joy unblam’d, and dwell\r\nLong time in peace by Families and Tribes\r\nUnder paternal rule; till one shall rise\r\nOf proud ambitious heart, who not content\r\nWith fair equalitie, fraternal state,\r\nWill arrogate Dominion undeserv’d\r\nOver his brethren, and quite dispossess\r\nConcord and law of Nature from the Earth;\r\nHunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)\r\nWith Warr and hostile snare such as refuse\r\nSubjection to his Empire tyrannous:\r\nA mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl’d\r\nBefore the Lord, as in despite of Heav’n,\r\nOr from Heav’n claming second Sovrantie;\r\nAnd from Rebellion shall derive his name,\r\nThough of Rebellion others he accuse.\r\nHee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns\r\nWith him or under him to tyrannize,\r\nMarching from _Eden_ towards the West, shall finde\r\nThe Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge\r\nBoiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;\r\nOf Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build\r\nA Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav’n;\r\nAnd get themselves a name, least far disperst\r\nIn foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,\r\nRegardless whether good or evil fame.\r\nBut God who oft descends to visit men\r\nUnseen, and through thir habitations walks\r\nTo mark thir doings, them beholding soon,\r\nComes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower\r\nObstruct Heav’n Towrs, and in derision sets\r\nUpon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase\r\nQuite out thir Native Language, and instead\r\nTo sow a jangling noise of words unknown:\r\nForthwith a hideous gabble rises loud\r\nAmong the Builders; each to other calls\r\nNot understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,\r\nAs mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav’n\r\nAnd looking down, to see the hubbub strange\r\nAnd hear the din; thus was the building left\r\nRidiculous, and the work Confusion nam’d.\r\n\r\nWhereto thus _Adam_ fatherly displeas’d.\r\nO execrable Son so to aspire\r\nAbove his Brethren, to himself affirming\r\nAuthoritie usurpt, from God not giv’n:\r\nHe gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl\r\nDominion absolute; that right we hold\r\nBy his donation; but Man over men\r\nHe made not Lord; such title to himself\r\nReserving, human left from human free.\r\nBut this Usurper his encroachment proud\r\nStayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends\r\nSiege and defiance: Wretched man! what food\r\nWill he convey up thither to sustain\r\nHimself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire\r\nAbove the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,\r\nAnd famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Justly thou abhorr’st\r\nThat Son, who on the quiet state of men\r\nSuch trouble brought, affecting to subdue\r\nRational Libertie; yet know withall,\r\nSince thy original lapse, true Libertie\r\nIs lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells\r\nTwinn’d, and from her hath no dividual being:\r\nReason in man obscur’d, or not obeyd,\r\nImmediately inordinate desires\r\nAnd upstart Passions catch the Government\r\nFrom Reason, and to servitude reduce\r\nMan till then free.  Therefore since hee permits\r\nWithin himself unworthie Powers to reign\r\nOver free Reason, God in Judgement just\r\nSubjects him from without to violent Lords;\r\nWho oft as undeservedly enthrall\r\nHis outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\r\nThough to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\r\nYet somtimes Nations will decline so low\r\nFrom vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\r\nBut Justice, and some fatal curse annext\r\nDeprives them of thir outward libertie,\r\nThir inward lost: Witness th’ irreverent Son\r\nOf him who built the Ark, who for the shame\r\nDon to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\r\n_Servant of Servants_, on his vitious Race.\r\nThus will this latter, as the former World,\r\nStill tend from bad to worse, till God at last\r\nWearied with their iniquities, withdraw\r\nHis presence from among them, and avert\r\nHis holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\r\nTo leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\r\nAnd one peculiar Nation to select\r\nFrom all the rest, of whom to be invok’d,\r\nA Nation from one faithful man to spring:\r\nHim on this side _Euphrates_ yet residing,\r\nBred up in Idol-worship; O that men\r\n(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\r\nWhile yet the Patriark liv’d, who scap’d the Flood,\r\nAs to forsake the living God, and fall\r\nTo-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\r\nFor Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\r\nTo call by Vision from his Fathers house,\r\nHis kindred and false Gods, into a Land\r\nWhich he will shew him, and from him will raise\r\nA mightie Nation, and upon him showre\r\nHis benediction so, that in his Seed\r\nAll Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\r\nNot knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\r\nI see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\r\nHe leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\r\n_Ur_ of _Chaldaea_, passing now the Ford\r\nTo _Haran_, after him a cumbrous Train\r\nOf Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\r\nNot wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\r\nWith God, who call’d him, in a land unknown.\r\n_Canaan_ he now attains, I see his Tents\r\nPitcht about _Sechem_, and the neighbouring Plaine\r\nOf _Moreb_ there by promise he receaves\r\nGift to his Progenie of all that Land;\r\nFrom _Hamath_ Northward to the Desert South\r\n(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam’d)\r\nFrom _Hermon_ East to the great Western Sea,\r\nMount _Hermon_, yonder Sea, each place behold\r\nIn prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\r\nMount _Carmel_; here the double-founted stream\r\n_Jordan_, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\r\nShall dwell to _Senir_, that long ridge of Hills.\r\nThis ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\r\nShall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\r\nIs meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\r\nThe Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\r\nPlainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,\r\nWhom _Faithful Abraham_ due time shall call,\r\nA Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\r\nLike him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\r\nThe Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\r\nFrom _Canaan_, to a Land hereafter call’d\r\n_Egypt_, divided by the River _Nile_;\r\nSee where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\r\nInto the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\r\nHe comes invited by a yonger Son\r\nIn time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\r\nRaise him to be the second in that Realme\r\nOf _Pharao_: there he dies, and leaves his Race\r\nGrowing into a Nation, and now grown\r\nSuspected to a sequent King, who seeks\r\nTo stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests\r\nToo numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\r\nInhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\r\nTill by two brethren (those two brethren call\r\n_Moses_ and _Aaron_) sent from God to claime\r\nHis people from enthralment, they return\r\nWith glory and spoile back to thir promis’d Land.\r\nBut first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\r\nTo know thir God, or message to regard,\r\nMust be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\r\nTo blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\r\nFrogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\r\nWith loath’d intrusion, and fill all the land;\r\nHis Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\r\nBotches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\r\nAnd all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\r\nHaile mixt with fire must rend th’ _Egyptian_ Skie\r\nAnd wheel on th’ Earth, devouring where it rouls;\r\nWhat it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\r\nA darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\r\nMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\r\nDarkness must overshadow all his bounds,\r\nPalpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\r\nLast with one midnight stroke all the first-born\r\nOf _Egypt_ must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\r\nThis River-dragon tam’d at length submits\r\nTo let his sojourners depart, and oft\r\nHumbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\r\nMore hard’nd after thaw, till in his rage\r\nPursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\r\nSwallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\r\nAs on drie land between two christal walls,\r\nAw’d by the rod of _Moses_ so to stand\r\nDivided, till his rescu’d gain thir shoar:\r\nSuch wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\r\nThough present in his Angel, who shall goe\r\nBefore them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\r\nTo guide them in thir journey, and remove\r\nBehinde them, while th’ obdurat King pursues:\r\nAll night he will pursue, but his approach\r\nDarkness defends between till morning Watch;\r\nThen through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\r\nGod looking forth will trouble all his Host\r\nAnd craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\r\n_Moses_ once more his potent Rod extends\r\nOver the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\r\nOn thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\r\nAnd overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\r\nSafe towards _Canaan_ from the shoar advance\r\nThrough the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\r\nLeast entring on the _Canaanite_ allarmd\r\nWarr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\r\nReturn them back to _Egypt_, choosing rather\r\nInglorious life with servitude; for life\r\nTo noble and ignoble is more sweet\r\nUntraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\r\nThis also shall they gain by thir delay\r\nIn the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\r\nThir government, and thir great Senate choose\r\nThrough the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\r\nGod from the Mount of _Sinai_, whose gray top\r\nShall tremble, he descending, will himself\r\nIn Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\r\nOrdaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\r\nTo civil Justice, part religious Rites\r\nOf sacrifice, informing them, by types\r\nAnd shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\r\nThe Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\r\nMankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God\r\nTo mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\r\nThat _Moses_ might report to them his will,\r\nAnd terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\r\nInstructed that to God is no access\r\nWithout Mediator, whose high Office now\r\n_Moses_ in figure beares, to introduce\r\nOne greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\r\nAnd all the Prophets in thir Age the times\r\nOf great _Messiah_ shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites\r\nEstablisht, such delight hath God in Men\r\nObedient to his will, that he voutsafes\r\nAmong them to set up his Tabernacle,\r\nThe holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\r\nBy his prescript a Sanctuary is fram’d\r\nOf Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\r\nAn Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\r\nThe Records of his Cov’nant, over these\r\nA Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\r\nOf two bright Cherubim, before him burn\r\nSeaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\r\nThe Heav’nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\r\nShall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\r\nSave when they journie, and at length they come,\r\nConducted by his Angel to the Land\r\nPromisd to _Abraham_ and his Seed: the rest\r\nWere long to tell, how many Battels fought,\r\nHow many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\r\nOr how the Sun shall in mid Heav’n stand still\r\nA day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\r\nMans voice commanding, Sun in _Gibeon_ stand,\r\nAnd thou Moon in the vale of _Aialon_,\r\nTill _Israel_ overcome; so call the third\r\nFrom _Abraham_, Son of _Isaac_, and from him\r\nHis whole descent, who thus shall _Canaan_ win.\r\n\r\nHere _Adam_ interpos’d.  O sent from Heav’n,\r\nEnlightner of my darkness, gracious things\r\nThou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne\r\nJust _Abraham_ and his Seed: now first I finde\r\nMine eyes true op’ning, and my heart much eas’d,\r\nErwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom\r\nOf mee and all Mankind; but now I see\r\nHis day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,\r\nFavour unmerited by me, who sought\r\nForbidd’n knowledge by forbidd’n means.\r\nThis yet I apprehend not, why to those\r\nAmong whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth\r\nSo many and so various Laws are giv’n;\r\nSo many Laws argue so many sins\r\nAmong them; how can God with such reside?\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Doubt not but that sin\r\nWill reign among them, as of thee begot;\r\nAnd therefore was Law given them to evince\r\nThir natural pravitie, by stirring up\r\nSin against Law to fight; that when they see\r\nLaw can discover sin, but not remove,\r\nSave by those shadowie expiations weak,\r\nThe bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude\r\nSome bloud more precious must be paid for Man,\r\nJust for unjust, that in such righteousness\r\nTo them by Faith imputed, they may finde\r\nJustification towards God, and peace\r\nOf Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies\r\nCannot appease, nor Man the moral part\r\nPerform, and not performing cannot live.\r\nSo Law appears imperfet, and but giv’n\r\nWith purpose to resign them in full time\r\nUp to a better Cov’nant, disciplin’d\r\nFrom shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,\r\nFrom imposition of strict Laws, to free\r\nAcceptance of large Grace, from servil fear\r\nTo filial, works of Law to works of Faith.\r\nAnd therefore shall not _Moses_, though of God\r\nHighly belov’d, being but the Minister\r\nOf Law, his people into _Canaan_ lead;\r\nBut _Joshua_ whom the Gentiles _Jesus_ call,\r\nHis Name and Office bearing, who shall quell\r\nThe adversarie Serpent, and bring back\r\nThrough the worlds wilderness long wanderd man\r\nSafe to eternal Paradise of rest.\r\nMeanwhile they in thir earthly _Canaan_ plac’t\r\nLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins\r\nNational interrupt thir public peace,\r\nProvoking God to raise them enemies:\r\nFrom whom as oft he saves them penitent\r\nBy Judges first, then under Kings; of whom\r\nThe second, both for pietie renownd\r\nAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receive\r\nIrrevocable, that his Regal Throne\r\nFor ever shall endure; the like shall sing\r\nAll Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock\r\nOf _David_ (so I name this King) shall rise\r\nA Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,\r\nForetold to _Abraham_, as in whom shall trust\r\nAll Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings\r\nThe last, for of his Reign shall be no end.\r\nBut first a long succession must ensue,\r\nAnd his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam’d,\r\nThe clouded Ark of God till then in Tents\r\nWandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.\r\nSuch follow him, as shall be registerd\r\nPart good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,\r\nWhose foul Idolatries, and other faults\r\nHeapt to the popular summe, will so incense\r\nGod, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,\r\nThir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark\r\nWith all his sacred things, a scorn and prey\r\nTo that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw’st\r\nLeft in confusion, _Babylon_ thence call’d.\r\nThere in captivitie he lets them dwell\r\nThe space of seventie years, then brings them back,\r\nRemembring mercie, and his Cov’nant sworn\r\nTo _David_, stablisht as the dayes of Heav’n.\r\nReturnd from _Babylon_ by leave of Kings\r\nThir Lords, whom God dispos’d, the house of God\r\nThey first re-edifie, and for a while\r\nIn mean estate live moderate, till grown\r\nIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow;\r\nBut first among the Priests dissension springs,\r\nMen who attend the Altar, and should most\r\nEndeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings\r\nUpon the Temple it self: at last they seise\r\nThe Scepter, and regard not _Davids_ Sons,\r\nThen loose it to a stranger, that the true\r\nAnointed King _Messiah_ might be born\r\nBarr’d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr\r\nUnseen before in Heav’n proclaims him com,\r\nAnd guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire\r\nHis place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;\r\nHis place of birth a solemn Angel tells\r\nTo simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;\r\nThey gladly thither haste, and by a Quire\r\nOf squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.\r\nA Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire\r\nThe Power of the most High; he shall ascend\r\nThe Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign\r\nWith earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav’ns.\r\n\r\nHe ceas’d, discerning _Adam_ with such joy\r\nSurcharg’d, as had like grief bin dew’d in tears,\r\nWithout the vent of words, which these he breathd.\r\n\r\nO Prophet of glad tidings, finisher\r\nOf utmost hope! now clear I understand\r\nWhat oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,\r\nWhy our great expectation should be call’d\r\nThe seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,\r\nHigh in the love of Heav’n, yet from my Loynes\r\nThou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son\r\nOf God most High; So God with man unites.\r\nNeeds must the Serpent now his capital bruise\r\nExpect with mortal paine: say where and when\r\nThir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus _Michael_.  Dream not of thir fight,\r\nAs of a Duel, or the local wounds\r\nOf head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son\r\nManhood to God-head, with more strength to foil\r\nThy enemie; nor so is overcome\r\n_Satan_, whose fall from Heav’n, a deadlier bruise,\r\nDisabl’d not to give thee thy deaths wound:\r\nWhich hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,\r\nNot by destroying _Satan_, but his works\r\nIn thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,\r\nBut by fulfilling that which thou didst want,\r\nObedience to the Law of God, impos’d\r\nOn penaltie of death, and suffering death,\r\nThe penaltie to thy transgression due,\r\nAnd due to theirs which out of thine will grow:\r\nSo onely can high Justice rest appaid.\r\nThe Law of God exact he shall fulfill\r\nBoth by obedience and by love, though love\r\nAlone fulfill the Law; thy punishment\r\nHe shall endure by coming in the Flesh\r\nTo a reproachful life and cursed death,\r\nProclaiming Life to all who shall believe\r\nIn his redemption, and that his obedience\r\nImputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits\r\nTo save them, not thir own, though legal works.\r\nFor this he shall live hated, be blasphem’d,\r\nSeis’d on by force, judg’d, and to death condemnd\r\nA shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross\r\nBy his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;\r\nBut to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,\r\nThe Law that is against thee, and the sins\r\nOf all mankinde, with him there crucifi’d,\r\nNever to hurt them more who rightly trust\r\nIn this his satisfaction; so he dies,\r\nBut soon revives, Death over him no power\r\nShall long usurp; ere the third dawning light\r\nReturne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise\r\nOut of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,\r\nThy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,\r\nHis death for Man, as many as offerd Life\r\nNeglect not, and the benefit imbrace\r\nBy Faith not void of works: this God-like act\r\nAnnuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy’d,\r\nIn sin for ever lost from life; this act\r\nShall bruise the head of _Satan_, crush his strength\r\nDefeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,\r\nAnd fix farr deeper in his head thir stings\r\nThen temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,\r\nOr theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,\r\nA gentle wafting to immortal Life.\r\nNor after resurrection shall he stay\r\nLonger on Earth then certaine times to appeer\r\nTo his Disciples, Men who in his Life\r\nStill follow’d him; to them shall leave in charge\r\nTo teach all nations what of him they learn’d\r\nAnd his Salvation, them who shall beleeve\r\nBaptizing in the profluent streame, the signe\r\nOf washing them from guilt of sin to Life\r\nPure, and in mind prepar’d, if so befall,\r\nFor death, like that which the redeemer dy’d.\r\nAll Nations they shall teach; for from that day\r\nNot onely to the Sons of _Abrahams_ Loines\r\nSalvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons\r\nOf _Abrahams_ Faith wherever through the world;\r\nSo in his seed all Nations shall be blest.\r\nThen to the Heav’n of Heav’ns he shall ascend\r\nWith victory, triumphing through the aire\r\nOver his foes and thine; there shall surprise\r\nThe Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines\r\nThrough all his realme, & there confounded leave;\r\nThen enter into glory, and resume\r\nHis Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high\r\nAbove all names in Heav’n; and thence shall come,\r\nWhen this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,\r\nWith glory and power to judge both quick & dead,\r\nTo judge th’ unfaithful dead, but to reward\r\nHis faithful, and receave them into bliss,\r\nWhether in Heav’n or Earth, for then the Earth\r\nShall all be Paradise, far happier place\r\nThen this of _Eden_, and far happier daies.\r\n\r\nSo spake th’ Archangel _Michael_, then paus’d,\r\nAs at the Worlds great period; and our Sire\r\nReplete with joy and wonder thus repli’d.\r\n\r\nO goodness infinite, goodness immense!\r\nThat all this good of evil shall produce,\r\nAnd evil turn to good; more wonderful\r\nThen that which by creation first brought forth\r\nLight out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,\r\nWhether I should repent me now of sin\r\nBy mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce\r\nMuch more, that much more good thereof shall spring,\r\nTo God more glory, more good will to Men\r\nFrom God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.\r\nBut say, if our deliverer up to Heav’n\r\nMust reascend, what will betide the few\r\nHis faithful, left among th’ unfaithful herd,\r\nThe enemies of truth; who then shall guide\r\nHis people, who defend? will they not deale\r\nWors with his followers then with him they dealt?\r\n\r\nBe sure they will, said th’ Angel; but from Heav’n\r\nHee to his own a Comforter will send,\r\nThe promise of the Father, who shall dwell\r\nHis Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith\r\nWorking through love, upon thir hearts shall write,\r\nTo guide them in all truth, and also arme\r\nWith spiritual Armour, able to resist\r\n_Satans_ assaults, and quench his fierie darts\r\nWhat Man can do against them, not affraid,\r\nThough to the death, against such cruelties\r\nWith inward consolations recompenc’t,\r\nAnd oft supported so as shall amaze\r\nThir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit\r\nPowrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends\r\nTo evangelize the Nations, then on all\r\nBaptiz’d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue\r\nTo speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,\r\nAs did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win\r\nGreat numbers of each Nation to receave\r\nWith joy the tidings brought from Heav’n: at length\r\nThir Ministry perform’d, and race well run,\r\nThir doctrine and thir story written left,\r\nThey die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,\r\nWolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,\r\nWho all the sacred mysteries of Heav’n\r\nTo thir own vile advantages shall turne\r\nOf lucre and ambition, and the truth\r\nWith superstitions and traditions taint,\r\nLeft onely in those written Records pure,\r\nThough not but by the Spirit understood.\r\nThen shall they seek to avail themselves of names,\r\nPlaces and titles, and with these to joine\r\nSecular power, though feigning still to act\r\nBy spiritual, to themselves appropriating\r\nThe Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv’n\r\nTo all Beleevers; and from that pretense,\r\nSpiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force\r\nOn every conscience; Laws which none shall finde\r\nLeft them inrould, or what the Spirit within\r\nShall on the heart engrave.  What will they then\r\nBut force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde\r\nHis consort Libertie; what, but unbuild\r\nHis living Temples, built by Faith to stand,\r\nThir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth\r\nWho against Faith and Conscience can be heard\r\nInfallible? yet many will presume:\r\nWhence heavie persecution shall arise\r\nOn all who in the worship persevere\r\nOf Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,\r\nWill deem in outward Rites and specious formes\r\nReligion satisfi’d; Truth shall retire\r\nBestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith\r\nRarely be found: so shall the World goe on,\r\nTo good malignant, to bad men benigne,\r\nUnder her own waight groaning, till the day\r\nAppeer of respiration to the just,\r\nAnd vengeance to the wicked, at return\r\nOf him so lately promis’d to thy aid,\r\nThe Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,\r\nNow amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,\r\nLast in the Clouds from Heav’n to be reveald\r\nIn glory of the Father, to dissolve\r\n_Satan_ with his perverted World, then raise\r\nFrom the conflagrant mass, purg’d and refin’d,\r\nNew Heav’ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date\r\nFounded in righteousness and peace and love,\r\nTo bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.\r\n\r\nHe ended; and thus _Adam_ last reply’d.\r\nHow soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,\r\nMeasur’d this transient World, the Race of time,\r\nTill time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,\r\nEternitie, whose end no eye can reach.\r\nGreatly instructed I shall hence depart,\r\nGreatly in peace of thought, and have my fill\r\nOf knowledge, what this vessel can containe;\r\nBeyond which was my folly to aspire.\r\nHenceforth I learne, that to obey is best,\r\nAnd love with feare the onely God, to walk\r\nAs in his presence, ever to observe\r\nHis providence, and on him sole depend,\r\nMerciful over all his works, with good\r\nStill overcoming evil, and by small\r\nAccomplishing great things, by things deemd weak\r\nSubverting worldly strong, and worldly wise\r\nBy simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake\r\nIs fortitude to highest victorie,\r\nAnd to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;\r\nTaught this by his example whom I now\r\nAcknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus also th’ Angel last repli’d:\r\nThis having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe\r\nOf wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs\r\nThou knewst by name, and all th’ ethereal Powers,\r\nAll secrets of the deep, all Natures works,\r\nOr works of God in Heav’n, Air, Earth, or Sea,\r\nAnd all the riches of this World enjoydst,\r\nAnd all the rule, one Empire; onely add\r\nDeeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,\r\nAdd Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,\r\nBy name to come call’d Charitie, the soul\r\nOf all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath\r\nTo leave this Paradise, but shalt possess\r\nA Paradise within thee, happier farr.\r\nLet us descend now therefore from this top\r\nOf Speculation; for the hour precise\r\nExacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,\r\nBy mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect\r\nThir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,\r\nIn signal of remove, waves fiercely round;\r\nWe may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;\r\nHer also I with gentle Dreams have calm’d\r\nPortending good, and all her spirits compos’d\r\nTo meek submission: thou at season fit\r\nLet her with thee partake what thou hast heard,\r\nChiefly what may concern her Faith to know,\r\nThe great deliverance by her Seed to come\r\n(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.\r\nThat ye may live, which will be many dayes,\r\nBoth in one Faith unanimous though sad,\r\nWith cause for evils past, yet much more cheer’d\r\nWith meditation on the happie end.\r\n\r\nHe ended, and they both descend the Hill;\r\nDescended, _Adam_ to the Bowre where _Eve_\r\nLay sleeping ran before, but found her wak’t;\r\nAnd thus with words not sad she him receav’d.\r\n\r\nWhence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;\r\nFor God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,\r\nWhich he hath sent propitious, some great good\r\nPresaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress\r\nVVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;\r\nIn mee is no delay; with thee to goe,\r\nIs to stay here; without thee here to stay,\r\nIs to go hence unwilling; thou to mee\r\nArt all things under Heav’n, all places thou,\r\nVVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.\r\nThis further consolation yet secure\r\nI carry hence; though all by mee is lost,\r\nSuch favour I unworthie am voutsaft,\r\nBy mee the Promis’d Seed shall all restore.\r\n\r\nSo spake our Mother _Eve_, and _Adam_ heard\r\nVVell pleas’d, but answer’d not; for now too nigh\r\nTh’ Archangel stood, and from the other Hill\r\nTo thir fixt Station, all in bright array\r\nThe Cherubim descended; on the ground\r\nGliding meteorous, as Ev’ning Mist\r\nRis’n from a River o’re the marish glides,\r\nAnd gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel\r\nHomeward returning.  High in Front advanc’t,\r\nThe brandisht Sword of God before them blaz’d\r\nFierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,\r\nAnd vapour as the _Libyan_ Air adust,\r\nBegan to parch that temperate Clime; whereat\r\nIn either hand the hastning Angel caught\r\nOur lingring Parents, and to th’ Eastern Gate\r\nLet them direct, and down the Cliff as fast\r\nTo the subjected Plaine; then disappeer’d.\r\nThey looking back, all th’ Eastern side beheld\r\nOf Paradise, so late thir happie seat,\r\nWav’d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate\r\nWith dreadful Faces throng’d and fierie Armes:\r\nSom natural tears they drop’d, but wip’d them soon;\r\nThe World was all before them, where to choose\r\nThir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:\r\nThey hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,\r\nThrough _Eden_ took thir solitarie way.\r\n\r\n  THE END.",
