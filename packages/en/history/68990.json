This assertion savors of truism,\r\nbut, since the achievement of these four masters in the enlargement\r\nof harmonic idiom, in diversity of formal evolution, and in intrinsic\r\nnovelty and profundity of musical sentiment and emotion remains so\r\nunalterably the point of departure in modern music, reiteration\r\nis unavoidable and essential. It were idle to deny that various\r\nfigures in musical history have shown prophetic glimpses of the\r\nfuture. Monteverdi's taste for unprepared dissonance and instinct\r\nfor graphic instrumental effect; the extraordinary anticipation of\r\nLiszt's treatment of the diminished seventh chord, and the enharmonic\r\nmodulations to be found in the music of Sebastian Bach, the presages\r\nof later German romanticism discoverable in the works of his ill-fated\r\nson Wilhelm Friedemann, constitute convincing details. The romantic\r\nambitions of Lesueur as to program-music found their reflection in\r\nthe superheated imagination of Berlioz, and the music-drama of Wagner\r\nderives as conclusively from _Fidelio_ as from the more conclusively\r\nromantic antecedents of _Euryanthe_. But, despite their illuminating\r\nquality, these casual outcroppings of modernity do not reverse the\r\naxiomatic statement made above.\r\n\r\nThe trend of modern music, then, may be traced first along the path of\r\nthe pervasive domination of Wagner; second, the lesser but no less\r\ntenacious influence of Liszt; it includes the rise of nationalistic\r\nschools, the gradual infiltration of eclecticism leading at last to\r\nrecent quasi-anarchic efforts to expand the technical elements of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nIf the critics of the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries\r\nhave successfully exposed not only the æsthetic flaws in Wagner's\r\ntheory of the music-drama, but also his own obvious departures in\r\npractice from pre-conceived convictions, as well as the futility of\r\nmuch of his polemic and philosophical writings, European composers\r\nof opera, almost without exception, save in Russia, have frankly\r\nadopted his methods in whole or in part. Bruckner, Bungert, d'Albert,\r\nSchillings, Pfitzner, Goldmark, Humperdinck, Weingartner, and Richard\r\nStrauss in Germany; Saint-Saëns (in varying degree), Chabrier, Lalo,\r\nMassenet (temporarily), Bruneau and Charpentier (slightly), d'Indy,\r\nChausson, and Dukas in France; Verdi (more remotely), Puccini, and\r\npossibly Wolf-Ferrari in Italy; Holbrooke in England, are among the\r\nmore conspicuous whose obligation to Wagner is frankly perceptible.\r\nIn Germany the most prominent contributors to dramatic literature,\r\naside from Cornelius, with _Der Barbier von Bagdad_, and Goetz with\r\n_Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung_, have been Goldmark, Humperdinck,\r\nand Richard Strauss. The latter, with an incredibly complex system\r\nof leading motives, an elaborately contrapuntal connotation of\r\ndramatic situations, aided by an intensely psychological orchestral\r\ndescriptiveness, has reached the summit of post-Wagnerian drama.\r\nHis later dramatic experiments--a ruthless adaptation of Molière's\r\n_Bourgeois gentilhomme_, containing the one-act opera _Ariadne auf\r\nNaxos_, and the ballet 'The Legend of Joseph'--are distinctly less\r\nrepresentative examples of his dramatic resourcefulness. In France,\r\nthe Wagnerian influence is typified in such works as Chabrier's\r\n_Gwendoline_, d'Indy's _Fervaal_, and to a lesser extent Chausson's\r\n_Le Roi Arthus_. Bruneau's realistic operas and Charpentier's\r\nsociological _Louise_ belong, first of all, to the characteristically\r\nFrench lyric drama in which the Wagnerian element is relatively\r\nunimportant. In Debussy's _Pelléas et Mélisande_, Dukas' _Ariane et\r\nBarbe-bleue_, Ravel's _L'Heure espagnole_, and Fauré's _Pénélope_,\r\nwe find a virtually independent conception of opera which may be\r\nalmost described as anti-Wagnerian. In Italy, the later Verdi shows\r\nan independent solution of dramatic problems, although conscious of\r\nthe work of Wagner. Puccini is the successor of Verdi, rather than\r\nthe follower of Wagner, although his use of motives and treatment of\r\nthe orchestra shows at least an unconscious assimilation of Wagnerian\r\npractice, Mascagni and Leoncavallo are virtually negligible except for\r\ntheir early successes, and one or two other works. Younger composers\r\nlike Montemezzi and Zadonai are beginning to claim attention, but\r\nWolf-Ferrari, combining Italian instinct with German training, seems\r\non the way to attain a renascence of the _opera buffa_, provided that\r\nhe is not again tempted by the sensational type represented by 'The\r\nJewels of the Madonna.' Opera in England has remained an exotic, save\r\nfor the operettas of Sullivan, despite the efforts of British composers\r\nto vitalize it. Holbrooke's attempt to produce an English trilogy seems\r\nfated to join previous failures, notwithstanding his virtuosity and his\r\ndramatic earnestness. Russian composers for the stage have steadily\r\nresisted the invasion of Wagnerian methods. Adhering, first of all, to\r\nthe tenets of Dargomijsky, individuals have gradually adopted their own\r\nstandpoint. The most characteristic works are Borodine's _Prince Igor_,\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff's _Sniégourutchka_, _Sadko_, _Mlada_, _Le Coq d'Or_,\r\nand Moussorgsky's _Boris Godounoff_ and _Khovanshchina_.\r\n\r\nIn the field of orchestral composition, the acceptance of Wagner's\r\nprocedure in orchestration is even more universal than his dramatic\r\nfollowing. If his system follows logically from the adoption of valve\r\nhorns and valve trumpets, the enlargement of wind instrument groups\r\nand the subdivision of the strings, its far-reaching application is\r\nstill a matter of amazement to the analyst. Even if it be granted that\r\nWagner himself predaciously absorbed individual methods of treatment\r\nfrom Weber, Meyerbeer, Berlioz, and Liszt, the ultimate originality of\r\nhis idiom justified his manifold obligations. German composers, except\r\namong the followers of Brahms, appropriated his extension of orchestral\r\neffect as a matter of course, the most notable being Bruckner,\r\nGoldmark, Humperdinck, Mahler, and Strauss. If the two latter in turn\r\ncan claim original idioms of their own, the antecedents of their\r\nstyles are none the less evident. French composers from Saint-Saëns\r\nto Dukas have made varying concessions to his persuasive sonorities;\r\neven the stanch Rimsky-Korsakoff fell before the seduction of Wagnerian\r\namplitude and variety of color. Glazounoff, Taneieff, Scriabine, and\r\nother Russians followed suit. Among English composers, Elgar and\r\nBantock fell instinctively into line, followed in some degree by\r\nWilliam Wallace and Frederick Delius. If Holbrooke is more directly a\r\ndisciple of Richard Strauss, that fact in itself denotes an unconscious\r\nacknowledgment to Wagner.\r\n\r\nIf Liszt has had a less all-embracing reaction upon modern composers,\r\nhis sphere of influence has been marked and widely extended. To begin\r\nwith, his harmonic style has been the subject of imitation second\r\nonly to Wagner up to the advent of Richard Strauss and Debussy. His\r\ninvention of the structurally elastic symphonic poem remains the\r\nsole original contribution in point of form which the nineteenth\r\ncentury can claim. For even the cyclic sonata form of Franck is\r\nbut a modification of the academic type, and was foreshadowed by\r\nBeethoven and Schumann. The vast evolution of structural freedom,\r\nthe infinite ramifications of subtle and dramatic program-music, and\r\nthe resultant additions of the most stimulating character to modern\r\nmusical literature rest upon the courageous initiative of Liszt. In\r\nFrance, Saint-Saëns' pioneer examples, though somewhat slight in\r\nsubstance, prepared the way for César Franck's _Les Éolides_ and _Le\r\nChasseur maudit_, Duparc's _Lénore_, d'Indy's _La forêt enchantée_,\r\nthe programmistic _Istar_ variations, _Jour d'été à la Montagne_,\r\nDukas' _L'Apprenti-sorcier_, Debussy's _Prélude à l'Après-midi d'un\r\nfaune_ and the Nocturnes (programmistic if impressionistic), Florent\r\nSchmitts' _Tragédie de Salomé_, and Roussel's _Evocations_. In\r\nGermany, Richard Strauss' epoch-making series of tone-poems, from\r\n_Macbeth_ to _Also sprach Zarathustra_, combine descriptive aptitude\r\nand orchestral brilliance with a masterly manipulation of formal\r\nelements. Weingartner's _Die Gefilde der Seligen_ and Reger's Böcklin\r\nsymphonic poems may be added to the list. In Russia, Balakireff's\r\n_Thamar_, Borodine's 'Sketch from Central Asia,' Rimsky-Korsakoff's\r\n_Scheherezade_ (although a suite), Glazounoff's _Stenka Razine_ and\r\nother less vital works, Rachmaninoff's 'Isle of the Dead,' Scriabine's\r\n'Poem of Ecstasy' and 'Poem of Fire' mark the path of evolution.\r\nSmetana's series of six symphonic poems entitled 'My Home' result\r\ndirectly from the stimulus of Liszt. In Finland, Sibelius' tone-poems\r\non national legendary subjects take a high rank for their poetic and\r\ndramatic qualities. If in England, Bantock's 'Dante and Beatrice,'\r\n'Fifine at the Fair' and other works, Holbrooke's 'Queen Mab,'\r\nWallace's 'François Villon,' Delius' 'Paris' and Elgar's 'Falstaff'\r\nexhibit differing degrees of merit, the example of Liszt is still\r\ninspiriting. Moreover, the Lisztian treatment of the orchestra,\r\nemphasizing as it does a felicitous employment of instruments of\r\npercussion, has proved a remarkable liberating force, especially in\r\nRussia and France. Liszt's piano idiom has been assimilated even more\r\nwidely than in the case of the symphonic poem and orchestral style.\r\nSmetana, Saint-Saëns, Balakireff, and Liapounoff occur at once as\r\nsalient instances.\r\n\r\nThe contributory reaction of Berlioz and Chopin upon modern music has\r\nbeen relatively less direct, if still apparent. It was exerted first in\r\nfertile suggestions to Wagner and Liszt at a susceptible and formative\r\nstage in their careers. Both have played some part in the awakening\r\nof Russian musical consciousness, Berlioz through his revolutionary\r\norchestral style and programmistic audacity, Chopin through his\r\ninsinuating pianistic idiom, which we find strongly reflected in the\r\nearlier works of Scriabine. Some heritage of Berlioz can undoubtedly be\r\ntraced in the music of Gustav Mahler, although expressed in a speech\r\nquite alien to that of the French pioneer of realism.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked in passing that the influence of Brahms has been\r\nintensive rather than expansive. This statement is entirely compatible\r\nwith a just appraisal of the worth and profundity of his music, nor\r\ncan it in any way be interpreted as a detraction of his unassailable\r\nposition. But in consideration of the absence of the coloristic and\r\nextreme subjective elements in Brahms' style, and in view of its\r\nconserving and reactionary force, the great symphonist cannot be\r\nregarded as specifically modernistic. Still, with his extraordinary\r\ncohesiveness of form and vital rhythmic progress, both in symphonic\r\nwriting, chamber music and piano pieces, Brahms has affected\r\nReger, Weingartner and Max Bruch in Germany, but also Glazounoff,\r\nRachmaninoff, Medtner, Parry, and others outside of it.\r\n\r\nWith the four symphonies of Brahms the long evolution of the classic\r\nform in Germany has apparently come to an end with an involuntary\r\nrecognition that little more could be attained upon conventional lines.\r\nThe symphonies of Bruckner emphasize this realization. Following in\r\nWagner's orchestral footsteps, both their structure and their ideas are\r\nof unequal value, in which separate movements not infrequently rise to\r\nsublimity of expression and dramatic fervor. While opinion is still\r\ndivided as to the merit of Mahler's ten symphonies, they represent\r\nisolated instances of powerfully conceived and tenaciously executed\r\nworks whose orchestral eloquence is in singularly apt conformity with\r\ntheir substance. After a precocious and conservative symphony, composed\r\nat the age of nineteen, which pleased Brahms, Richard Strauss waited\r\ntwenty years before attempting in the _Symphonia Domestica_ so elastic\r\na form as almost to escape classification in this type. Despite much\r\nfoolish controversy over the programmistic features of this work, its\r\nbrilliant musical substance, its fundamental and logical coherence,\r\nand the remarkable plastic coördination of its themes constitute it a\r\nunique experiment in free symphonic structure. In France, the symphony\r\nhas evolved a type somewhat apart from the Teutonic example, although\r\nan outcome of it, namely, the cyclical, in which its themes are\r\nderived from generative phrases. After three innocuous specimens (one\r\nunpublished) Saint-Saëns' third symphony shows many of the attributes\r\nof classicality. César Franck's symphony in D minor embodies most of\r\nhis best qualities, together with much structural originality. Lalo's\r\nmore fragile work in G minor displays a workmanship and individuality\r\nwhich entitles it to record. Chausson's Symphony in B-flat, despite its\r\nkinship with Franck, possesses a significance quite beyond its actual\r\nrecognition. D'Indy, after composing an excellent cyclic work upon a\r\nFrench folk-song, produced his instrumental masterpiece with a second\r\nin B-flat, which for logical structure and fusion of classic elements\r\nwith modernistic sentiment deserves to be classed as one of the finest\r\nof its time. If Russian symphony composers have not as a whole reached\r\nas high a mark as in the freer and more imaginative forms, nevertheless\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff, Borodine, Balakireff, Glazounoff, Rachmaninoff, and\r\nTaneieff have displayed sympathy with classic ideals, and have achieved\r\nexcellent if not surpassing results within these limits. The symphonies\r\nof Parry, Cowen and others in England have enlarged little upon the\r\nconventional scope. Elgar raised high hopes with his first symphony\r\nin A-flat, but speedily dismissed them with his second in E-flat.\r\nSibelius, in Finland, having given proof of his uncommon creative force\r\nand delineative imagination in his tone-poems, has also exhibited\r\nunusual originality and vitality in his four symphonies. The last of\r\nthese virtually departs from a genuine symphonic form, but its novelty\r\nalike in ideas and treatment suggests that he, too, demands greater\r\nelasticity of resource. For the problem of combining the native style\r\nand technical requirements of the symphony with modern sentiment is one\r\nof increasing difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe field of piano music, chamber works, songs and choral works is of\r\ntoo wide a range for detailed indication of achievement. The piano\r\nmusic of Balakireff, Liapounoff, Rachmaninoff, Scriabine, of Grieg, of\r\nFranck, Debussy, Dukas, and Ravel, of Cyril Scott and others merits a\r\nhigh place. The chamber music of Smetana, Dvořák, Grieg (despite its\r\nshortcomings), Franck, d'Indy, Fauré, Ravel, of Wolf, Strauss and Reger\r\ndeserves an equal record. The songs of Wolf and Strauss, of Duparc,\r\nFauré and Debussy, of Moussorgsky, of Sibelius; the choral works of\r\nFranck, d'Indy, Pierné, Schmitt, of Delius, Bantock, Elgar and other\r\nEnglishmen are conspicuous for technical and expressive mastery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              II\r\n\r\nApart from the general assimilation of the innovating features due\r\nto Wagner and Liszt, the most striking factor in musical evolution\r\nof the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been the rise\r\nof nationalistic schools of composition. These have deliberately\r\ncultivated the use of native folk-song and dance-rhythms, and in the\r\ncase of operas and symphonic poems have frequently drawn upon national\r\nlegend for subjects. One of the earliest of these groups was the\r\nBohemian, whose leader, Smetana, already mentioned in connection with\r\nthe symphonic poem, chamber and piano music, also won a distinguished\r\nplace by his vivacious comic opera 'The Bartered Bride,' known abroad\r\nchiefly by its inimitable overture. If Dvořák promised to be a worthy\r\ndisciple of a greatly talented pioneer, his abilities were diffused by\r\nfalling a victim to commissions from English choral societies, and in\r\nendeavoring to emulate Brahms. In reality he was most significant when\r\nunconscious, as in the Slavic Dances and his naïve and charming Suite,\r\nop. 39, although his symphony 'From the New World' and certain chamber\r\nworks based upon negro themes are as enduring as anything he composed.\r\nHampered by a truly Schubertian lack of self-criticism, his path toward\r\noblivion has been hastened by this fatal defect, although his national\r\nflavor and piquant orchestral color deserve a juster fate.\r\n\r\nIn the Scandinavian countries Grieg, and, to a lesser degree, Nordraak,\r\nas well as Svendsen and Sinding tempered nationality with German\r\nculture. Grieg, the more dominant personality, was a born poet, and\r\nimparted a truly national fervor to his songs and piano pieces. In the\r\nsonata form he was pathetically inept, despite the former popularity of\r\nhis chamber works and piano concerto. Certain mannerisms in abuse of\r\nsequence, and a too persistent cultivation of small forms, have caused\r\nhis works to lose ground rapidly; nevertheless Grieg has given a poetic\r\nand nationalistic savor to his best music that makes it impossible to\r\noverlook its value.\r\n\r\nA coterie of accomplished and versatile musicians which yields to none\r\nfor intrinsic charm, vitality, and poetic spontaneity is that of the\r\nso-called Neo-Russians, self-styled 'the Invincible Band.' Resenting\r\nRubinstein's almost total surrender to Teutonic standards, and scorning\r\nTschaikowsky as representing a pitiable compromise between Russian and\r\nGerman standpoints, they revolted against conventional technique with\r\nas great pertinacity as did Galileo, Peri, Caccini, and Monteverdi in\r\nthe late sixteenth century. Their æsthetic foster-father, Balakireff,\r\nfor a time dominated the studies and even supervised the composition\r\nof the members--Borodine, Cui, Moussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakoff.\r\nUltimately, each followed his own path, though not without a certain\r\ncommunity of ideal. Aiming to continue the work of Glinka and\r\nDargomijsky, both in opera and instrumental music, they wished to\r\nuse folk-songs for themes and to utilize national legends or fairy\r\nstories. But they could not resist the alien form of the symphonic\r\npoem, and with it the orchestra of Liszt, and, while they opposed the\r\nWagnerian dramatic forms, one at least, Rimsky-Korsakoff, could not\r\nwithstand the palpable advantages of the Wagnerian orchestra. Their\r\nworks combined the elements of western and oriental Russia, adhered\r\nlargely to folk-song or elements of its style, and in the opera\r\nembodied folk-dances, semi-Pagan worship and ceremonial with striking\r\nnationalistic effect. Many of their orchestral pieces have taken place\r\nin the international repertory of orchestras; of the operas a smaller\r\nnumber have penetrated to European theatres. While the nationalistic\r\noperas of Rimsky-Korsakoff are little known beyond Russia, they show\r\nhis talent in a broadly humanistic and epic standpoint, hardly hinted\r\nat in his orchestral works. Moussorgsky's _Boris Godounoff_, one of\r\nthe finest operas since Wagner, claims attention from the fact that it\r\nattains dramatic vitality from a standpoint diametrically opposed to\r\nWagner. The influence of _Boris Godounoff_ is palpable as forming the\r\nsubtle dramatic idiom of _Pelléas et Mélisande_.\r\n\r\nGlazounoff, Taneieff, and Glière represent the cosmopolitan element\r\namong Russian composers of to-day. Of these Glazounoff is the most\r\nnotable. His early symphonic poem, _Stenka Razine_, gave promise of\r\nan original and brilliant career, but instead he has become steadily\r\nmore reactionary. Among his eight symphonies there is scarcely one that\r\nis preëminent from beginning to end. His ballets, _Raymonda_, 'The\r\nSeasons,' and 'Love's Ruses,' have been surpassed by younger men. His\r\nviolin concerto is among his most able works. A master of technique and\r\nstructure and a remarkably erudite figure, his lack of progressiveness\r\nhas been against him. A younger composer, Tcherepnine, is known for\r\nhis skillful ballets, 'Narcissus,' 'Pan and Echo,' and 'The Pavilion\r\nof Armida,' which incline, nevertheless, towards the conventional.\r\nRachmaninoff is also of reactionary tendencies, although his piano\r\nconcertos and his fine symphonic poem, 'The Isle of the Dead,' have\r\nshown his distinction.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the modern French school, largely owing to a patriotic\r\nreaction after the Franco-Prussian war and the liberal policies of the\r\nNational Society, has brought about one of the most fertile movements\r\nin modern music. The transition from the operas of Gounod, Thomas,\r\nBizet, and the early Massenet to those of Chabrier, Lalo, d'Indy,\r\nBruneau, Charpentier, Debussy, Dukas, Ravel, and Fauré is remarkable\r\nfor its concentrated progress in dramatic truthfulness. Similarly,\r\nbeginning with the eclectic and facile Saint-Saëns, the more romantic\r\nand fearless Lalo, and the mystic Franck, through the audacious\r\nChabrier and the suave and poetic Fauré, including the serious and\r\ndevoted followers of Franck, d'Indy, Duparc, de Castillon, Chausson,\r\nand Lekeu, the versatile Dukas, to the epoch-making Debussy with the\r\nyounger men like Ravel, Schmitt and Roussel, French instrumental music\r\nhas developed, on the one hand, a fervently classic spirit despite its\r\nmodernism and, on the other, an impressionistic exoticism which is\r\nwithout parallel in modern music. Aside from a vitally new harmonic\r\nidiom, which in Debussy reaches its greatest originality despite\r\nd'Indy, Fauré, and the later developments of Ravel, the attainment of\r\nracially distinct dramatic style in such works as Debussy's _Pelléas\r\net Mélisande_, Dukas' _Ariane et Barbe-bleue_, Ravel's _L'Heure\r\nespagnole_, and Fauré's _Pénélope_ is one of the crowning achievements\r\nof this group. Furthermore, following the examples of the younger\r\nRussians, the ballets of _Jeux_ and _Khamma_ by Debussy, _La Péri_\r\nby Dukas, _La Tragédie de Salomé_ by Florent Schmitt, _Le Festin\r\nde l'Arraignée_ by Roussel, _Orphée_ by Roger-Ducasse, and, most\r\nsignificant of all, _Daphnis et Chloé_ by Maurice Ravel, have given a\r\nremarkable impetus to a genuine choreographic revival.\r\n\r\nThere has been no nationalistic development in England comparable to\r\nthat in other countries, although there has been no lack of serious and\r\nsustained effort to be both modern and individual. The most important\r\nof British composers is undoubtedly Elgar, who has attained something\r\nlike independence with his brilliant and well-made orchestral works,\r\nand more especially for his oratorio 'The Dream of Gerontius.' If\r\nElgar only carried on further a systematized use of the leading motive\r\nas suggested by Liszt in his oratorios, it was done with a dramatic\r\nresource and eloquence which made the method his own. Bantock, gifted\r\nwith an orchestral perception above the average, showing a natural\r\naptitude for exoticism, achieved a successful fusion of eclectic\r\nelements with individuality in his three-part setting of the Rubaîyat\r\nof Omar Khayyám. Other choral works and orchestral pieces have met\r\nwith a more uncertain reception. William Wallace has been conspicuous\r\nfor his imaginative symphonic poems, and the insight of his essays on\r\nmusic. Frederick Delius, partly German, has maintained a personal and\r\nsomewhat detached individuality in orchestral, choral and dramatic\r\nworks of distinctive value. Josef Holbrooke has been mentioned already\r\nfor his unusual mastery of orchestral technique, and his courageous\r\nand ambitious attempts in opera. Many younger composers are striving\r\nto be personal and independent, though involuntarily affected by one\r\nor another of existent currents in modern music. Of these Cyril Scott\r\nattempts a praiseworthy modernistic and impressionistic sentiment, in\r\nwhich he leans heavily on Debussy's harmonic innovations. Thus, while\r\nEnglish composers have been active, they have fallen to the ready\r\ntemptations of eclecticism, a growing force in music of to-day, and in\r\nconsequence their art has not the same measure of nationalistic import\r\nas in Russia, France, and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as the musical world has moved forward in respect\r\nto structure from the symphony to the symphonic poem, followed by\r\nits logical sequence the tone-poem, in which the elements of various\r\nforms have been incorporated, so has there been progress and even\r\nrevolution in the technical material of music itself. Dargomijsky was\r\nprobably the pioneer in using the whole-tone scale, as may be seen\r\nin the third act of his opera 'The Stone Guest,' composed in 1869.\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff elaborated on his foundation as early as 1880 in\r\nhis opera _Sniégourutchka_. Moussorgsky showed unusually individual\r\nharmonic tendencies, as the first edition of _Boris Godounoff_ before\r\nthe revisions and alterations by Rimsky-Korsakoff clearly demonstrate.\r\nAfter casual experiments by Chabrier, d'Indy, and Fauré, Debussy\r\nfounded an original harmonic system, in which modified modal harmony,\r\na remarkable extension of whole-tone scale chords, the free use of\r\nninths, elevenths and thirteenths are the chief ingredients. Dukas\r\nhas imitated Debussy to some extent, Ravel owes much to him; both\r\nhave developed independently, Ravel in particular has approached if\r\nnot crossed the boundaries of poly-harmony. Scriabine, following the\r\nnatural harmonic heritage of the Russians, has evolved an idiom of\r\nhis own possessing considerable novelty but disfigured by monotony,\r\nin that it consists chiefly of transpositions of the thirteenth-chord\r\nwith the alteration of various constituent intervals. What he might not\r\nhave accomplished can only be conjectured, since his career has been\r\nterminated by his sudden death. Although Richard Strauss has greatly\r\nenlarged modern harmonic resource, his results must be regarded on the\r\nwhole as a by-product of his contrapuntal virtuosity. In his treatise\r\non harmony Schönberg refers to his 'discovery' of the whole-tone scale\r\nlong after both Russians and French had used it, but it is noteworthy\r\nthat Schönberg arrived at the conception of this scale and its chords\r\nwith an absolute and unplagiaristic independence.\r\n\r\nThe most recent developments affecting the technical character of music\r\nare poly-harmony, or simultaneous use of chords in different keys, and\r\nfree dissonant counterpoint. Striking instances of the former type\r\nof anarchic experiment may be found in the music of Igor Stravinsky,\r\nwhose reputation has been made by the fantastic imagination and the\r\ndramatic sincerity of his ballets 'The Bird of Fire,' _Petrouchka_,\r\n'The Ceremonial of Spring,' and 'The Nightingale.' In these he has\r\nmingled Russian and French elements, fusing them into a highly personal\r\nand extremely dissonant style, which in its pungent freedom and\r\ningenious mosaic of tonalities is both highly diverting and poignantly\r\nexpressive. Stravinsky is one of the most daring innovators of to-day,\r\nand both his dramatic vitality and the audacity of his musical\r\nconceptions mark him as a notable figure from whom much may be expected.\r\n\r\nIf Maurice Ravel, as shown in his ballet _Daphnis et Chloé_, was a\r\npioneer in poly-harmony, Alfred Casella, of Italian parentage but of\r\nFrench education, has gone considerably further. Similar tendencies may\r\nbe found in the music of Bartók, Kodály and other Hungarians.\r\n\r\nIt seemed formerly that Strauss had pushed the dissonant contrapuntal\r\nstyle as far as it could go, but his style is virtually conventional\r\nbeside that of the later Schönberg. Schönberg has already passed\r\nthrough several evolutionary stages, but his mature idiom abjures\r\ntonality to an incredible extent, and he forces the procedures of free\r\ncounterpoint to such audacious disregard of even unconventional euphony\r\nthat few can compass his musical message. Time may prove, however, that\r\ntonality is a needless convention, and it is possible to declare that\r\nthere is nothing illogical in his contrapuntal system. It lies in the\r\nextravagant extension of principles of dissonance which have already\r\nbeen accepted. It is indubitable that Schönberg succeeds in expressing\r\nmoods previously unknown to musical literature, and it is conceivable\r\nthat music may encompass unheard-of developments in this direction,\r\njust as poly-harmony has already proved extremely fruitful.\r\n\r\nThe developments of poly-harmony and dissonant contrapuntal style\r\nprophesy the near inadequacy of our present musical scale. Busoni and\r\nothers have long since advocated a piano in which the sharps and\r\nflats should have separate keys. As music advanced from the modes to\r\nthe major and minor keys, and finally to the chromatic scale, so the\r\nnecessity for a new scale may constitute logically the next momentous\r\nproblem in musical art.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, the barriers of nationalism have become relaxed.\r\nAn almost involuntary interchange of idioms has caused music to\r\ntake on an international character despite a certain maintenance of\r\nracial traits. Eclecticism is becoming to a certain extent universal.\r\nAchievement is too easily communicable from one country to another. In\r\nsome respects music was more interesting when it was more parochial.\r\nTo prophesy that music is near to anarchy is to convict one's self of\r\napproaching senility, for the ferment of the revolutionary element has\r\nalways existed in art. Since the time of Wagner and Liszt, however,\r\nmusical development has proceeded with such extreme rapidity as to\r\nendanger the endurance of our traditional material. Poly-harmony,\r\ndissonant counterpoint and the agitation for a new scale are suspicious\r\nindications. Disregarding the future, however, let us realize that the\r\ndiversity and complexity of modern music is enthralling, and that most\r\nof us can readily endure it as it now is for a little longer.\r\n\r\n                                                 EDWARD BURLINGAME HILL.\r\n\r\nMay, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CONTENTS OF VOLUME THREE\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  Introduction by Edward Burlingame Hill                             vii\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n    I.

Just as in the preceding volume we\r\nwere obliged to qualify our use of the words 'classic' and 'romantic,'\r\npartly because all such nomenclature is more or less arbitrary, partly\r\nbecause of the fusion of styles and dove-tailing of periods which may\r\nbe observed in the history of any art, so it now becomes necessary to\r\ndefine the word 'modern' in its present application.\r\n\r\nNow 'modern' may mean merely _new_ or _up-to-date_. And in that\r\nsense it may indicate any degree of newness: it may include the last\r\ntwenty-five years or the last century, or it may be made to apply\r\nto contemporaneous works only. But in another sense--that generally\r\naccepted in connection with music--it means 'advanced,' progressive, or\r\nunprecedented in any other period. Here, too, we may understand varying\r\ndegrees of modernity. The devotees of the most recent development,\r\nimpatient of the usual broad application of the term, have dubbed their\r\nschool the 'futurist.' In fact, any of these characterizations, whether\r\nin a time sense or a quality sense, are merely relative. Wagner's\r\ndisciples, disdainful of the romanticists, called his music the 'music\r\nof the future.' Now, alas, critics classify him as a romantic composer!\r\nBach, on the other hand, long popularly regarded as an archaic bugaboo,\r\nis now frequently characterized as a veritable modern. 'How modern that\r\nis!' we exclaim time and again, while listening to an organ toccata or\r\nfugue arranged by Busoni! Beethoven, the great classic, is in his later\r\nperiod certainly more 'modern' than many a romanticist--Mendelssohn,\r\nfor instance, or even Berlioz--though only in a harmonic sense, for he\r\nhad not the command of orchestral color that the great and turbulent\r\nFrenchmen made accessible to the world.\r\n\r\nThe newness of the music is thus seen to have little to do with its\r\nmodernity. Even the word 'contemporary' gives us no definite clue, for\r\nthere are men living to-day--like Saint-Saëns--whose music is hardly\r\nmodern when compared to that of a Wolf, dead these twelve years, or his\r\nown late countrymen Chabrier and Fauré--not to speak of the recently\r\ndeparted Scriabine with his _clavier à lumière_.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite impossible to include in such a volume as this only\r\nthe true moderns--in the æsthetic sense. We should have to go back to\r\nBeethoven with his famous chord comprising every degree of the diatonic\r\nscale (in the Ninth Symphony), or at least to Chopin, according to\r\none interpretation. According to another we should have to exclude\r\nBrahms and all his neo-classical followers who content themselves\r\nwith composing in the time-honored forms. (Since there will always\r\nbe composers who prefer to devote themselves to the preservation and\r\ncontinuation of formal tradition, this 'classical' drift will, as\r\nWalter Niemann remarks, be a 'modernism' of all times.) Brahms has, as\r\na matter of fact, been disposed of in the preceding volume, but the\r\ninclusion in the present volume of men like Volkmann, Lachner, etc.,\r\nsome of whom were born long before Brahms, calls for an apology. It\r\nis merely a matter of convenience, just as the treatment of men like\r\nGlinka and Gade in connection with the nationalistic developments of\r\nthe later nineteenth century is merely an expedient. Such chronological\r\nliberties are the historian's license. We have, to conclude, simply\r\ntaken the word modern in its widest and loosest sense, both as regards\r\ntime and quality, and we shall let the text explain to what degree\r\na composer justifies his position in the volume. We may say at the\r\noutset that all the men reviewed in the present chapter would have been\r\nincluded in Volume II but for lack of space.\r\n\r\nIn Volume II the two great movements known as the classic and the\r\nromantic have been fairly brought to a close. Brahms and Franck on the\r\none side, Wagner and Liszt on the other, may be considered to have\r\nconcluded the romantic period as definitely as Beethoven concluded\r\nthe classic. Like him, too, they not only surveyed but staked out the\r\npath of the future. But no great art movement is ever fully concluded.\r\n(It has been said by æsthetic philosophers that we are still in the\r\nera of the Renaissance.) Just as in the days of Beethoven there lived\r\nthe Cherubinis, the Clementis, the Schuberts (as regards the symphony\r\nat least) who trod in the great man's footsteps or explored important\r\nby-paths, in some respects supplemented and completed his work; so\r\nthere are by- and after-currents of the Romantic Movement which also\r\ncannot be ignored. They are represented by men like Lachner, Ferdinand\r\nHiller, Reinecke and Volkmann in Germany; by Saint-Saëns, Massenet\r\nand Lalo in France; Gade in Denmark.[1] Some of their analogous\r\npredecessors have all but passed from memory, perhaps their own works\r\nwill soon disappear from the current répertoire. Especially in the\r\ncase of the Germans (whose country has certainly suffered the strain\r\nof over-cultivation and over-production, and which has produced in\r\nthis age the particular brand known as 'kapellmeister music') is this\r\nlikely. But it must be borne in mind that these composers had command\r\nof technical resources far beyond the ken of their elder brothers; also\r\nthat, by virtue of the more subjective qualities characteristic of the\r\nmusic of their period, as well as the vastly broadened musical culture\r\nof this later day, they were able to appeal more readily to a very wide\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe historical value of these men lies in their exploitation of\r\nthese same technical resources. They thoroughly grasped the formulæ\r\nof their models; what the pioneers had to hew out by force, these\r\nfollowers acquired with ease. They worked diligently within these\r\nlimits, exhausting the possibilities of the prescribed area and proving\r\nthe ground, so to speak, so that newcomers might tread upon it with\r\nconfidence. They were not as uncompromising, perhaps, as the pioneers\r\nand high-priests themselves and therefore fused styles that others\r\nthought irreconcilable. What seemed iconoclastic became commonplace\r\nin their hands. Thus their eclecticism opened the way for new\r\noriginalities; their very conservatism induced progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nGermany, it will be remembered, was, during Wagner's lifetime, divided\r\ninto two camps: the classic-romantic Mendelssohn-Schumann school\r\nwhich later rallied about the person of Brahms, on the one hand, and\r\nthe Wagner-Liszt, sometimes called the late-romantic or 'New German'\r\nschool, on the other. The adherents of the former are those whom\r\nwe have called the poets, the latter the painters, in music; terms\r\napplying rather to the manner than to the matter, since the 'painters,'\r\nfor another reason--namely, because they believed that a poetic idea\r\nshould form the basis of the music and determine its forms--might with\r\nequal rights call themselves 'poets.' And, indeed, their followers, the\r\n'New Germans,' among whom we reckon Mahler and Strauss, constitute what\r\nin a later chapter we have called the 'poetic' school of contemporary\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nFew musicians accepted Wagner's gospel in his lifetime. Raff and other\r\nLiszt disciples, the Weimar group, in other words, were virtually the\r\nonly ones. A host, however, worshipped the names of Mendelssohn and\r\nSchumann. They gathered in Leipzig, their citadel, where Mendelssohn\r\nreorganized the Gewandhaus concerts in 1835,[2] and founded the Royal\r\nConservatory in 1843, and in the Rhine cities, where Schumann's\r\ninfluence was greatest. These men flourished during the very time that\r\nWagner was the great question of the day. While preaching the gospel of\r\nromanticism, they also upheld the great classic traditions. The advent\r\nof Brahms, indeed, brought a revival of pure classic feeling. This\r\npersists even to-day in the works of men whose romantic inspirations,\r\nakin to Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Chopin, find expression in forms of\r\nclassic cast.\r\n\r\nBoth Schumann and Wagner were reformers interested in the broadening\r\nof musical culture, the improvement of taste, and the establishment of\r\na standard of artistic propriety--Wagner on the stage, Schumann in the\r\nconcert room. The former was successful, the latter only partially so.\r\nFor, while the standards of the concert room are much higher to-day\r\nthan they were in Schumann's day, musical taste in the home, which\r\nshould be guided by these standards, has, if anything, deteriorated.\r\nThe reason for this lies primarily in one of the inevitable\r\ndevelopments of musical romanticism itself--the _genre_ tendency;\r\nsecondarily, in the fact that, while the Wagnerians were propagandists,\r\nwriters of copious polemics and agitators, the classic romanticists\r\nwere purely professional musicians who disdained to write, preferring\r\ndeeds to words (and incidentally doing far too much), or else, like\r\nHiller, were _feuilletonists_, pleasant gossips about their art and\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nThe development of the small forms, the miniature, the _genre_ in\r\nshort, and the corresponding decay of the larger forms was perhaps\r\nthe most outstanding result of the romantic movement. Wagner alone,\r\nthe dramatic romanticist, continued to paint large canvases, frescoes\r\nin vivid colors. The 'poetic' romanticists were of a lyric turn, and\r\nrequired compact and intimate forms of expression. They had created the\r\nsong, they had built up a new piano literature out of small pieces,\r\nminiatures like Schubert's 'Musical Moments,' Schumann's 'Fantasy\r\nPieces,' Mendelssohn's 'Songs without Words,' Field's 'Nocturnes,'\r\nChopin's Dances, Preludes, and Études. Franz, Jensen, Lassen, and\r\nothers continued the song; Brahms, with his _Intermezzi_; Henselt,\r\nHeller, and Kirchner, with his piano miniatures, the piano piece. The\r\nfirst degenerated into Abt, Curschmann, and worse, the second into the\r\ntype of thing of which 'The Last Hope' and 'The Maiden's Prayer' were\r\nthe ultimate manifestations. Sentiment ran over in small gushes and\r\ndrippings, even the piano study was made the vehicle for a sigh. The\r\nsonata of a former day became a sonatina or an 'impromptu' of one kind\r\nor another.\r\n\r\nThe parallel thing now happened in other fields. The concert overture\r\nof Mendelssohn had in a measure displaced the symphony. What has been\r\ncalled the '_genre_ symphony' of Mendelssohn, Schumann, _et al._ was\r\nalso in the direction of minimization. Even Brahms in his gigantic\r\nworks emphasizes the tendency by the intermezzo character of his slow\r\nmovements, by the orchestral filigree partaking of the chamber music\r\nstyle. Now came the revival of the orchestral suite by Lachner and\r\nRaff, the sinfonietta, and the serenade for small orchestra. Again we\r\nsense the same trend in the appearance of the choral ballad and in the\r\ntremendous output of small dramatic cantatas for mixed or men's voices.\r\n\r\nIn France, instrumental literature during the nineteenth century had\r\nbeen largely tributary to that of Germany, just as its opera earlier in\r\nthe century was of Italian stock. But the development of the 'grand'\r\nopera of Meyerbeer, on the one hand, and the _opéra comique_, on the\r\nother, had produced a truly Gallic form of expression, of which the\r\nromanticism of the century made use. Gounod and his colleagues of the\r\nlyric drama; Bizet, the genius of his generation, with his sparkling\r\nrhythms, his fine tunes and his orchestral freshness; Délibes and David\r\nwith their oriental color, compounded a new French idiom which already\r\nfound a quasi-symphonic expression in the _L'Arlésienne_ suites of\r\nBizet. Berlioz stands as a colossus among his generation and to this\r\nday has perhaps not been quite assimilated by his countrymen. The\r\nGermans have profited from his orchestral reforms at least as much\r\nas the French. But he gave the one tremendous impetus to symphonic\r\ncomposition, stimulated interest in Beethoven and Weber and so pointed\r\nthe way for his younger compatriots. Already _he_ speaks of Saint-Saëns\r\nas an accomplished musician.\r\n\r\nSaint-Saëns is, indeed, the next great exponent of the classic\r\ntradition as well as the earliest disciple of the late romantic school\r\nof Liszt and Wagner in France. Beside him, Massenet, no less great as\r\ntechnician, forms the transition to modernism on the operatic side,\r\nwhile Lalo and Godard devote themselves to both departments. César\r\nFranck, the Belgian, stands aloof in his ascetic isolation as the real\r\ncreator of the modern French idiom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider some of these 'transition' composers in detail;\r\nfirst the Germans, then the French.\r\n\r\nCertain attributes they all have in common. Most of them lived long\r\nand prospered, enjoying a wide influence or popularity in their\r\nday; Lachner and Reinecke both came near to ninety; Volkmann near\r\neighty; Saint-Saëns is still hale at eighty. All of them were highly\r\nproductive: Hiller, Reinecke, Raff, and Lachner surpassed 200 in their\r\nopus-numbers; Saint-Saëns has gone well over a hundred; and Massenet\r\nhas written no less than twenty-three operas alone. Nearly all of them\r\nwere either virtuosos or conductors: Hiller, Reinecke, Saint-Saëns,\r\nBülow, Henselt, Heller were brilliant pianists; Lachner, Saint-Saëns,\r\nand Widor also organists; Godard a violinist. The first four of these\r\nwere eminent conductors. Most of them were pedagogues besides; some,\r\nsuch as Reinecke, Hiller, Jadassohn, Rietz, and Massenet, among the\r\nmost eminent of their generation.\r\n\r\nFranz Lachner is the oldest of them. He was born, 1803, in Rain (Upper\r\nBavaria), and died, 1890, in Munich. Thus he came near filling out\r\nfour-score and ten, antedating Wagner by ten years and surviving him by\r\nseven. His career came into actual collision with that of the Bayreuth\r\nmaster too, since the latter's coming to Munich as the favorite of\r\nthe newly ascended King Ludwig II forced Lachner from his autocratic\r\nposition as general musical director.\r\n\r\nMany forces must have reacted upon an artist whose life thus spans\r\nthe ages. He was a friend of Schubert in Vienna, where he became\r\norganist in 1824, and is said to have found favor even with Beethoven.\r\nSechter and Abbé Stadler gave him the benefit of their learning.\r\nAfter holding various conductor's posts in Vienna and in Mannheim\r\nhe finally found his way to Munich, where he had already brought\r\nout his D minor symphony with success. As court kapellmeister he\r\nconducted the opera, the church performances of the royal chapel\r\nchoir and the concerts of the Academy, meanwhile creating a long\r\nseries of successful works, nearly all of which exhibit his astounding\r\ncontrapuntal skill. His seven orchestral suites, a form which he and\r\nRaff revived, occupy a special place in orchestral literature, as a\r\nsort of direct continuation of Bach's and Händel's instrumental works.\r\nThey are veritable treasure stores of contrapuntal art. Perhaps another\r\ngeneration will appreciate them better; to-day they have fallen into\r\nneglect. This is even more true of his eight symphonies, four operas,\r\ntwo oratorios, etc. Of his chamber music (piano quartets, string\r\nquartets, quintets, sextets, nonet for wind, etc.), his piano pieces\r\nand songs, influenced by Schubert, some few numbers have survived.\r\n\r\nMost prominent in Mendelssohn's immediate train is Ferdinand Hiller.\r\nHis junior only by two years (he was born Oct. 24, 1811, in Frankfurt),\r\nhe followed closely in the footsteps of that master. Like him, he came\r\nof Jewish and well-to-do parents; like him, he had the advantage of\r\nan early training, a broad culture and wide travel. A pupil of Hummel\r\nand a brilliant pianist, he was presented to Beethoven in Vienna; in\r\nParis he hobnobbed with Cherubini, Rossini, Chopin, Liszt, Meyerbeer\r\nand Berlioz, taught and concertized; in Milan he produced an opera\r\n(_Romilda_) by the aid of Rossini. Mendelssohn, already his friend,\r\nbrought out his oratorio 'Jerusalem Destroyed' at the Gewandhaus in\r\n1840, and in 1843-44 (after a sojourn in Rome) he himself directed\r\nthe Gewandhaus concerts made famous by Mendelssohn. Shortly after,\r\nhe inaugurated a series of subscription concerts in Dresden, also\r\nconducting a chorus, and there brought out two operas (_Traum in der\r\nChristnacht_, 1845, and _Konradin_, 1847). Finally he did for Cologne\r\nwhat Mendelssohn had done for Leipzig by organizing the conservatory\r\nand the Gewandhaus concerts: he established the Cologne conservatory\r\n(1850) and became conductor of the _Konzertgesellschaft_ and the\r\n_Konzertchor_, both of which participated in the famous Gürzenich\r\nconcerts and the Rhenish music festivals. The eminence of his position\r\nmay be deduced from the fact that in 1851-52 he was asked to direct the\r\nItalian opera in Paris. As teacher and pianist he was no less renowned.\r\nFor that reason alone history cannot ignore him.\r\n\r\nAs a composer Hiller illustrates what we have said of the degeneration\r\nof the early romantic school into musical _genre_, though as a\r\ncontemporary of Mendelssohn he must be reckoned as a by-rather than a\r\npost-romantic. He commanded only the small forms, in which, however,\r\nhe displayed great technical finish, polished grace and a 'clever\r\npedantry.' In short piano pieces, _Rêveries_ (of which he wrote four\r\nseries), impromptus, rondos, marches, waltzes, variations, and études\r\nhe was especially happy. An F-sharp major piano concerto, sonatas\r\nand suites, as well as his chamber works (violin and 'cello sonatas,\r\ntrios, quartets, etc.), are grateful and pleasing in their impeccable\r\nsmoothness. But his six operas, two oratorios, three symphonies\r\nand other large works have gone the way of oblivion. His numerous\r\novertures, cantatas, choral ballads, vocal quartets, duets and songs\r\nstamp him as a real, miniature-loving romantic. In productivity, too,\r\nhe remains true to the breed; his opus numbers exceed two hundred.\r\nHiller died in Cologne in 1885.\r\n\r\nAnother friend of Mendelssohn was Julius Rietz (1812-77), whose\r\nbrother Eduard, the violinist, had been the friend of the greater\r\nmaster's youth. He, too, after conducting in Düsseldorf, came to the\r\nLeipzig Gewandhaus as Gade's successor in 1848, took Mendelssohn's\r\nplace as municipal musical director and taught at the conservatory\r\nuntil he became court kapellmeister and head of the conservatory in\r\nDresden. His editorial work, the complete editions of the works of\r\nBach, Händel, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Mozart, published by the\r\nhouse of Breitkopf and Härtel, are important. His compositions are\r\nwholly influenced by Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nAmong the few who actually had the benefit of Mendelssohn's personal\r\ntuition is Richard Wüerst (1824-81), whose activities were, however,\r\ncentred in Berlin, where he was musical director from 1874, royal\r\nprofessor from 1877, and a member of the Academy. His second\r\nsymphony (op. 21) was prize-crowned in Cologne and his cantata, _Der\r\nWasserneck_, is a grateful composition for mixed chorus. Several of his\r\nsongs also have become popular.\r\n\r\nKarl Reinecke is less exclusive in his influence. He divides his\r\nallegiance at least equally between Mendelssohn and Schumann. He is\r\nthe example _par excellence_ of the professional musician, the cobbler\r\nwho sticks to his last. He did not, like Hiller, indulge in literary\r\nchit-chat about his art, confining himself to writings of pedagogical\r\nimport. He learned his craft from his father, an excellent musician\r\nand drill-master, and never had to go outside his home for direct\r\ninstruction. Thus he became an accomplished pianist (unrivalled at\r\nleast in one department--Mozart), at nineteen appeared as virtuoso in\r\nSweden and Denmark, and in 1846-48 was court pianist to King Christian\r\nVIII. After spending some time in Paris he joined Hiller's teaching\r\nstaff in Cologne conservatory, then held conductor's posts in Barmen\r\nand Breslau, and finally (1860) occupied Mendelssohn's place at the\r\nGewandhaus in Leipzig. There, when the new building was dedicated\r\nin 1884, his bust in marble was placed beside those of Mendelssohn\r\nand Schumann, and not till 1885 was he dethroned from his seat of\r\nauthority--with the advent of Nikisch. At the conservatory, too, his\r\nactivity was continuous from 1860 on--as instructor in piano and free\r\ncomposition. From 1897 to his retirement in 1902 he was director of\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nReinecke was born in 1824 at Altona, near Hamburg, and enjoyed the\r\ncharacteristic longevity of the 'transition' composers, living well\r\ninto the neighborhood of ninety. In fecundity he surpasses even Hiller,\r\nfor his works number well-nigh three hundred. Besides Mendelssohnian\r\nperfection, well-rounded classic form and fine organization in\r\nworkmanship, flavored with a touch of Schumannesque subjectivity,\r\nReinecke shows traces of more advanced influences. The idioms of Brahms\r\nand even the 'New Germans' crept into his work as time went on. Of\r\ncourse, since Reinecke was a famous pedagogue, his piano compositions\r\n(sonatas for two and four hands, sonatinas, fantasy pieces, caprices,\r\nand many other small forms) enjoyed a great reputation as teaching\r\nmaterial, which somewhat overshadowed their undoubted intrinsic value\r\nas music. His four piano concertos are no longer heard, nor are those\r\nfor violin, for 'cello, and for harp. But his chamber music--the\r\ndepartment where thorough musicianship counts for most--is no doubt\r\nthe most staple item in his catalogue. There are a quintet, a quartet,\r\nseven trios, besides three 'cello sonatas, four violin sonatas, and\r\na fantasy for violin and piano, also a sonata for flute. His most\r\npopular and perhaps his best work are the _Kinderlieder_, 'of classic\r\nimportance in every sense, easily understood by children and not\r\nwithout interest for adults.'[3] Again it is the miniature form that\r\nprevails. Similarly in the orchestral field, the overtures (_Dame\r\nKobold_, _Aladin_, _Friedensfeier_, _Festouvertüre_, _In memoriam_) and\r\nthe serenade for string orchestra have outlasted the three symphonies,\r\nwhile the operas ('King Manfred,' 1867, three others, and the\r\n_singspiel_ 'An Adventure of Händel'), as well as an oratorio, masses,\r\netc., have already faded from memory, though the smaller choral works,\r\nwith orchestra and otherwise (including the Fairy Poems for women's\r\nvoices and the cycle _Von der Wiege bis zum Grabe_), still maintain\r\nthemselves in the repertoire of German societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalomon Jadassohn (1831-1902) was still more of a pedagogue and less\r\nof a composer. Yet he wrote copiously, over one hundred works being\r\npublished. It is to be noted that he was a pupil of Liszt as well as\r\nMoritz Hauptmann, but he gravitated to Leipzig and lived there from\r\n1852 on. He has a particular fondness for the canon form and makes his\r\nchief mark in orchestral and chamber music. But his teaching manuals on\r\nharmony and counterpoint are his real monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most important contemporary of Brahms, following in\r\ntracks of Schumann, was Robert Volkmann. His acquaintance with Schumann\r\nwas the predominating stimulus of his artistic career, and, since\r\nBrahms is too big and independent a genius to deserve the epithet,\r\nVolkmann may count as the Düsseldorf master's chief epigone. He was\r\nbut five years younger than Schumann, being born April 6, 1815, at\r\nLommatzsch in Saxony, the son of a cantor, who instructed him in piano\r\nand organ playing. He studied theory with Anacker in Freiberg and K.\r\nF. Becker in Leipzig. He taught in Prague (1839) and Budapest (1842),\r\nlived in Vienna 1854-58, and again in Prague, where he was professor\r\nof harmony and counterpoint at the National Academy of Music, and died\r\nin 1893.\r\n\r\nHis first published work, the 'Fantasy Pictures' for piano, appeared in\r\n1839 in Leipzig. Unlike most other composers of this group, he managed\r\nto give his larger forms a permanent value; his two symphonies, in B\r\nmajor (op. 44) and D minor (op. 53) respectively, are still frequently\r\nplayed. Especially the last contains matter that is imbued with real\r\nfeeling and effectively handled. His three serenades for string\r\norchestra (opera 62, 63, and 69, the last with 'cello obbligato) are\r\nno less pleasing, and, in spite of the tribute which Volkmann pays to\r\nSchumann in all his works, even original. Of other instrumental music\r\nthere are two overtures, the piano trio in B minor, which first made\r\nVolkmann's name more widely known, together with two string quartets\r\nin A minor and G minor, one other trio and four more quartets, a\r\n'cello concerto, a romance each for 'cello and violin (with piano),\r\na _Konzertstück_ for piano and a number of small works for piano as\r\nwell as for violin and piano. Among his vocal compositions two masses\r\nfor men's voices and a number of secular pieces for solo voice with\r\norchestral accompaniment are the most important.\r\n\r\nWoldemar Bargiel (1828-97), Theodor Kirchner (1824-1903), Karl\r\nGrädener (1812-83), and Albert Dietrich (b. 1829) are all disciples\r\nof Schumann. The first, a stepbrother of Clara Schumann, is perhaps\r\nthe most important. He worked chiefly with the orchestra and chamber\r\ncombinations, his overture to 'Medea' and his trios being most\r\nnoteworthy, but he contributed to choral and solo song literature as\r\nwell. Kirchner is known for his finely emotional piano miniatures (some\r\naccompanied by string instruments) as well as for chamber music and\r\nsongs. Grädener, too, composed in all these forms, and Dietrich, who\r\nwas court kapellmeister in Oldenburg and was in close personal touch\r\nwith Schumann in Düsseldorf, left symphonies, overtures, chamber music\r\nand songs altogether in the spirit of the great arch-romantic.\r\n\r\nThe composers so far discussed constitute what is sometimes called\r\nthe Leipzig circle. While they can not in any sense be considered\r\nas radicals, and, indeed, were frequently attacked as conservative\r\nor academic by the followers of the more radical wing which made\r\nits headquarters at Weimar, they appear distinctly progressive when\r\ncompared with the ultra-conservative group of composers centred in\r\nBerlin, who made it their particular duty to uphold tradition and to\r\napply their energies to the creation of choral music of rather antique\r\ntype. 'It may be that the attitude of certain Berlin masters,' says\r\nPratt,[4] 'like Grell, Dehn, and Kiel, serve a useful purpose as a\r\ncounterpoise to the impulsive swing of style away from the traditions\r\nof the old vocal counterpoint. They certainly helped to keep musical\r\neducation from forgetting solid structure in composition amid its\r\ndesires to exploit impressionistic and sensational devices. Probably\r\nthis reactionary influence did good in the end, though its intolerant\r\nnarrowness exasperated the many who were eagerly searching out new\r\npaths. It at least resulted in making Berlin a centre for choral music\r\nof a severe type, for able teachers of the art of singing, for musical\r\ntheory and for scholarly investigators of musical history.' It may be\r\nadded that the Royal Academy was the stronghold of this extreme 'right\r\nwing,' and that the chief institutions which helped to uphold old\r\nvocal traditions were the _Singakademie_, the _Domchor_, the _Institut\r\nfür Kirchenmusik_ (later merged into the _Hochschule für Musik_). The\r\nConservatory, founded in 1850 by Marx, Kullak, and Stern, and the _Neue\r\nAkademie der Tonkunst_, established in 1855 by Theodor Kullak, also\r\nacquired considerable importance.\r\n\r\nEduard August Grell (1800-86) gave proof of his contrapuntal genius in\r\na series of sacred works including a sixteen-part mass, an oratorio,\r\nand a Te Deum, besides many songs and motets. He assisted Rungenhagen\r\nin conducting the _Singakademie_ from 1832, becoming sole conductor and\r\nteacher of composition at the Academy in 1851, and was a musician of\r\nvery wide influence. Siegfried Dehn (1799-1858) is chiefly important\r\nas teacher of a number of the composers mentioned in this chapter and\r\nas the author of treatises. Friedrich Kiel (1821-85), whose requiem in\r\nF minor has been called among all later works of this class the most\r\nworthy successor of those of Mozart and Cherubini, has also written\r\na _Missa Solemnis_, an oratorio _Christus_, and another Requiem (A\r\nminor)--works which attest above all the writer's polyphonic skill,\r\nand which prove the appropriateness of applying such a style to modern\r\nworks of devotional character. Kiel's _Stabat mater_, _Te Deum_, 130th\r\nPsalm and two-part motets for women's voices, as well as his chamber\r\nmusic and piano pieces, are all worthy of consideration. Karl Friedrich\r\nRungenhagen (d. 1851) and August Wilhelm Bach (d. 1869), both noted\r\nas composers of choral music, may complete our review of the 'Berlin\r\ncircle.'\r\n\r\nThere remain to be mentioned those specialists who are concerned almost\r\nexclusively with the two most characteristic mediums of the romantic\r\n_genre_--the piano piece and the song. Schumann and Chopin had brought\r\nthe miniature piano composition to its highest plane of expression\r\nand the most advanced technical standard, which even the dramatic\r\nimagination and the virtuoso brilliance of Liszt could not surpass.\r\nThey and such milder romanticists as Mendelssohn and John Field had\r\nbrought this class of music within the reach of amateurs, Schumann even\r\nwithin that of the child. Brahms, with no thought of the dilettante,\r\nhad intensified this form of expression, making a corresponding\r\ndemand upon technical ability. It remained for men like Adolf Henselt,\r\nStephen Heller, and Theodor Kullak to popularize the new pianistic\r\nidiom, as Clementi, Hummel, and Moscheles had popularized that of the\r\nclassics. These are the real workers in _genre_, monochrome genre, with\r\ntheir pictorial description, their somewhat bourgeois romanticism and\r\nsometimes maudlin sentimentality. Even their études are cast in an easy\r\nlyrical vein which was made to convey the pretty sentiment.\r\n\r\nHenselt (1814-89) was an eminent pianist, born in Silesia, pupil of\r\nHummel and Sechter in Vienna. After 1838 he lived in St. Petersburg.\r\nPieces like the _Poème d'amour_ and the 'Spring Song' are comparable\r\nto Mendelssohn's 'Songs without Words,' but they are more richly\r\nembroidered and of a fuller sonority. His F minor concerto is justly\r\nfamous. Stephen Heller (1814-88) was also famous as a concert pianist.\r\nOf his compositions, to the number of 150, all for his own instrument,\r\nmany are truly and warmly poetic in content. Though lacking Schumann's\r\npassion and Chopin's harmonic genius, he surpasses Mendelssohn in\r\nthe originality and individuality of his ideas. In a number of his\r\nthings, probably pot-boilers, he leans dangerously to the salon type\r\nof composition, with which many of his immediate followers flooded\r\nthe market. We are all familiar with the album-leaf, fly-leaf,\r\nmood-picture, fairy and flower piece variety of piano literature, as\r\nwell as the pseudo-nature study, the travel picture in which the Rhine\r\nand its castles and Loreley, the Alps and its cowbells, Venice with its\r\nbarcarolles and Naples with its tarantellas figure so conspicuously.\r\n\r\nKullak (1818-82), already mentioned as the founder of the _Neue\r\nAkademie_ of Berlin and famous both as pianist and teacher, wrote some\r\n130 works, most of which is in the _salon_ type or in the form of\r\nbrilliant fantasias and paraphrases, less important, perhaps, than\r\nhis études ('School of Octave Playing,' etc.). The piano technicians\r\nHenri Hertz (1803-88), Sigismund Thalberg (1812-71), Karl Klindworth\r\n(b. 1830), Karl Tausig (1841-71), Nicolai Rubinstein (1835-81), brother\r\nof Anton and founder of the Moscow conservatory, and Hans von Bülow, of\r\nwhom we shall speak later, might all be mentioned in this connection,\r\nthough their work as virtuosi, teachers, and editors is of greater\r\nmoment than their efforts as original composers.\r\n\r\nThe song engaged the exclusive activity of numberless composers of this\r\nperiod, and perhaps to a great extent with as untoward results as the\r\npiano piece. But there are, on the other hand, men like Eduard Lassen\r\n(1830-1904), Adolf Jensen (1837-79), and Wilhelm Taubert (1811-91)\r\nwhose work, in part at least, will take a place beside that of the\r\ngreat romantics. Robert Franz, by far the most important of these, has\r\nbeen treated in Volume II (p. 289). Taubert is to-day chiefly known for\r\nhis 'Children's Songs,' full of ingenuous charm and sincere feeling.\r\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that their composer wrote a half\r\ndozen operas, incidental music for Euripides' 'Medea' and Shakespeare's\r\n'Tempest,' as well as symphonies, overtures, chamber, piano and choral\r\nworks. Berlin, his birthplace, remained his headquarters. Here he\r\nconducted the court concerts, the opera and the _Singakademie_, and was\r\nthe president of the musical section in the Senate of the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\nAdolf Jensen, in Hugo Riemann's judgment, is much more than Franz\r\nentitled to the lyric mantle of Schumann. His songs, appearing in\r\nmodest series bearing no special title, have in them much real poetic\r\nimagination. They are unmistakably influenced by Wagner. Books 4, 6,\r\nand 22, as well as the two cycles _Dolorosa_ and _Erotikon_, are picked\r\nby Naumann as especially noteworthy. The popular _Lehn' deine Wang_ is\r\nmost frequently sung, but is one of the less meritorious of Jensen's\r\nsongs. The composer has also been successful with pianoforte works,\r\nhis sonata op. 25 and the pieces of opera 37, 38, and 42 being worthy\r\nessays along the lines of Schumann. An eminently aristocratic character\r\nand a profound subjective expression are their distinguishing features,\r\ntogether with the soft beauty of their melodic line. Jensen was a\r\nnative of Königsberg (1837), and spent some years in Russia in order\r\nto earn sufficient money to live near Schumann in Düsseldorf, but the\r\ntragic end of the latter frustrated this plan. Hence he followed a call\r\nto conduct the theatre orchestra in Posen, later going to Copenhagen,\r\nKönigsberg, Berlin, Dresden, and Graz. He died in Baden-Baden in 1879.\r\n\r\nLassen, another song-writer of distinction, came more definitely\r\nunder the Liszt influence and will therefore be treated with the 'New\r\nGermans' in another section.\r\n\r\nThe degeneration of the song, corresponding to that of the small\r\npiano forms, is to be noted in the productions of such men as Franz\r\nAbt (1819-85) and Karl Friedrich Curschmann (1804-41). Abt is among\r\nsong-writers the typical _Spiessbürger_, the middle-class Philistine\r\ndear to the _Männerchor_ member's heart. His songs are of that popular\r\nmelodiousness which at its best flavors of the folk-song and at its\r\nworst of the music hall. Of the former variety are '_Wenn die Schwalben\r\nheimwärts ziehn_' and '_Gute Nacht, mein herziges Kind_.' All of\r\nAbt's songs and vocal quartets are of the more or less saccharine\r\nsentimentality which for a time was such an appealing factor in\r\nAmerican popular music. Indeed, when Abt visited the United States in\r\n1872 he was received with extraordinary acclaim.\r\n\r\nCurschmann's songs are perhaps slightly superior in musical value, and\r\nat one time were equally popular, but they are not as near to becoming\r\nfolk-songs as are some of Abt's. Many others might be mentioned among\r\nthe purveyors of this sentimental stuff. If, as Naumann says, Taubert\r\nand his kind are the musical bourgeoisie, these are the small middle\r\nclass. Arno Kleffel (b. 1840), Louis Ehlert (1825-84), Heinrich Hofmann\r\n(1842-1902), Alexander von Fielitz (b. 1860) may be regarded as\r\nstanding on the border line of the two provinces.\r\n\r\nMuch more worthy, from a purely musical standpoint, are the frank\r\nexpressions of good humor and hilarity, the light rhythmic sing-song\r\nof the comic opera and the operetta represented by Lortzing and Johann\r\nStrauss (Jr.), respectively. Albert Lortzing (1801-51) revived or\r\nperpetuated in a new (and more engaging) form the singspiel of J. A.\r\nHiller and Dittersdorf, the _genre_ which, as we remember, had its\r\norigin in the ballad operas of eighteenth-century England. For all\r\nhis lightheartedness and ingenuousness, and despite his indebtedness\r\nto Italy and the _opéra comique_, Lortzing belongs to the Romantic\r\nmovement. Bie is of that opinion and says of him: 'He was at bottom\r\na tender and lightly sentimental nature running over with music and\r\nwinning his popularity in the _genre_ of the bourgeois song and\r\nthe heart-quality chorus.' Born as the son of an actor, travelling\r\naround from theatre to theatre, learning to play various instruments,\r\nappearing in juvenile rôles, becoming actor, singer and conductor by\r\nturns, Lortzing fairly absorbed the ingredients that go to make the\r\nsuccessful provider of light amusement. Successful he was only in\r\nan artistic sense--economically always 'down on his luck.' He began\r\nto compose early and turned out operas by the dozen, all dialogue\r\noperas or _singspiele_, writing (or adapting) both words and music.\r\nNot till 1835 did he make a hit--with _Die beiden Schützen_. _Zar und\r\nZimmermann_, _Der Wildschütz_, _Undine_ (a romantic fairy opera), and\r\n_Der Waffenschmied_ are the most successful of his works, and still\r\nlive as vigorous an existence in Germany as the Gilbert and Sullivan\r\noperas do in England. He became more and more popular as time went on,\r\nfor he had no successful imitator. No one after him managed to write\r\nsuch dear old songs, such funny ensembles, and such touching scenes of\r\nevery-day life. No one, in short, could make people laugh and cry by\r\nturns with such perfect musical art. He is a classic, as classic in his\r\nform as Dittersdorf; but, as Bie says, Mozart, Schubert, and Weber had\r\nlived, and, for Lortzing, not in vain.\r\n\r\nIn this department, too, we must record a degeneration. It was\r\naccomplished notably by Victor Nessler (1841-90), whose _Trompeter von\r\nSäkkingen_ still haunts the German opera houses, while its most popular\r\nnumber, _Behüt dich Gott_, is still a leading 'cornet solo,' zither\r\nselection, and hurdy-gurdy favorite.\r\n\r\nJohann Strauss (1825-1899)[5] might be denied a place in many a serious\r\nhistory. But let us not forget that a large part of the public, when\r\nyou say 'Strauss,' still think of him instead of Richard! And neither\r\nlet us forget Brahms' remark about the 'Blue Danube' waltz--that he\r\nwished he might have written so beautiful a melody--was quite sincere.\r\nThe 'Blue Danube' has become the second Austrian national anthem--or\r\nat least the leading Viennese folk-song. 'Artist's Life,' 'Viennese\r\nBlood,' '_Bei uns z'Haus_,' '_Man lebt nur einmal_' (out of which\r\nTaussig made one of the most brilliant of concert pieces)--these\r\nwaltzes are hardly less beloved of the popular heart--and feet\r\nunspoiled by one-step or tango. In his operettas, too, whose style is\r\nsimilar to that of Offenbach and Lecocq (see II, p. 392 ff.), Strauss\r\nremains the 'waltz king': the pages of _Die Fledermaus_ ('The Bat'),\r\n'The Gypsy Baron,' and 'The Queen's Lace Handkerchief' teem with\r\nfascinating waltz rhythms. Strauss is as inimitable in his way as\r\nLortzing was in his--to date he has no serious rival, unless it be the\r\ncomposer of _Rosenkavalier_ himself. Karl Millöcker[6] (1842-99) with\r\nthe 'Beggar Student' and Franz von Suppé (1819-1895) with _Das Mädchen\r\nvom Lande_, _Flotte Bursche_, etc., come nearest to him in reputation.\r\nThe latter should be remembered for more serious work as well, and the\r\nstill popular 'Poet and Peasant' overture. He was the teacher of the\r\nAmerican Reginald de Koven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nIf Leipzig represents the centre, and Berlin the right wing, the group\r\nof Liszt disciples gathered together in Weimar must be taken as the\r\n'left' of the romantic schools. Out of this wing has grown the new\r\nGerman school which is still in the heyday of its glory and among whose\r\nadherents may be reckoned most of the contemporary German composers.\r\nWe have mentioned in this chapter only two of the older disciples of\r\nthis branch, namely Raff (who has already been noticed in Vol. II), and\r\nLassen, who is most widely known as a song-writer. The rest we defer to\r\na later chapter.\r\n\r\nJoseph Joachim Raff was born at Lachen, on Zürich lake, in 1822.\r\nThe son of an organist, he first became an elementary teacher. His\r\nfirst encouragement came from Mendelssohn, but his hope to be able\r\nto study with that master was never realized. Bülow and Liszt were\r\nalso helpful to him, but many disappointments beset his path. He\r\nfollowed Liszt to Weimar in 1850, became a collaborator on the _Neue\r\nZeitschrift für Musik_, and championed Wagner in a brochure entitled\r\n'The Wagner Question' (1854). In the course of his sixty years (he\r\ndied in Frankfurt in 1882) he turned out what is perhaps the largest\r\nnumber of works on record. His opus numbers go far beyond 200--even\r\nthe indefatigable Riemann does not attempt a complete summary of\r\nthem. There are 11 symphonies, 3 orchestral suites, 5 overtures and\r\norchestral works; concertos, sonatas, etc., for various instruments; 8\r\nstring quartets, a string sextet and an octet, piano trios, quartets,\r\nand every kind of smaller form imaginable. The piano pieces flavor in\r\nmany cases of the salon. The songs, duets, vocal quartets and choruses\r\nare chiefly remarkable for their great number. His opera 'King Alfred'\r\nnever got beyond Weimar, while some of his six others (comic, lyric,\r\nand grand) were not even performed. Out of all this mass only the\r\n_Wald_ and _Leonore_ symphonies have stood the test of time, and even\r\nthese are rapidly fading.\r\n\r\nYet Raff was in some ways an important man. His extraordinary and\r\nextremely fruitful talent was subjected to the changing influences of\r\nthe neo-classic and the late romantic school. If the Mendelssohnian\r\nmodel led him to emphasize the formalistic elements in his work, he\r\nsoon realized that perfect form was only a means and not an end.\r\nThat emotion, mood, and expression were not to be subordinated to it\r\nhe learned from Liszt. Hence his works, descriptive in character as\r\ntheir titles imply, show the conflict between form and content which\r\nhad already become a problem with Berlioz. His symphonies, now purely\r\ndescriptive (a development starting with the pastoral symphony of\r\nBeethoven), now dramatic (with Berlioz's _Fantastique_ as the model),\r\nare mildly programmistic and colorful, but have neither the sweep of\r\nimagination of Berlioz nor the daring brilliance of Liszt.\r\n\r\nAt any rate Raff had considerable influence upon others--Edward\r\nMacDowell among them. He 'proved,' as it were, the methods of the new\r\nGerman school along mediocre lines. He was a pioneer and not a mere\r\ncamp follower as most of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nHans von Bülow's (1830-94) importance as pianist, conductor, and\r\neditor overshadows his claim as a creative musician. As such he has\r\nleft music for Shakespeare's 'Julius Cæsar,' a symphonic mood-picture\r\n'Nirvana,' an orchestral ballad 'The Singer's Curse,' and copious\r\npiano works. Their style is what may be expected from their creator's\r\nclose associations with Liszt and Wagner, which are too well known for\r\ncomment. He became Liszt's pupil in 1853 (marrying his daughter Cosima\r\nin 1857)[7] and was Wagner's staunchest champion as early as 1849. In\r\nhis later years he gave evidence of a broad catholicity and progressive\r\nspirit by making propaganda for Brahms and propitiating the youthful\r\nRichard Strauss. In his various executive activities he accomplished\r\nmiracles for the cause of musical culture, and as conductor of the\r\nMeiningen and the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra laid the foundation of\r\nthe contemporary conductor's art.\r\n\r\nEduard Lassen (1830-1904), who, through Liszt's influence, was made\r\nmusical director at the Weimar court in 1858, becoming Hofkapellmeister\r\nin 1861, is chiefly known for his pleasing songs. His early training\r\nwas received at the Conservatory, where he won the _prix de Rome_ in\r\n1851. The fact that his songs betray at times an almost Gallic grace is\r\ntherefore not surprising. He wrote, besides two operas (_Frauenlob_ and\r\n_Le Captif_), music for Hebbel's _Nibelungen_ (11 'character pieces'\r\nfor orchestra), for Sophokles' 'Œdipus Colonos,' and for Goethe's\r\n'Faust'; also symphonies, overtures, cantatas, etc.\r\n\r\n                                                           C. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nTurning to France, we have as the leading 'transition' composers\r\nMassenet, Saint-Saëns, and Lalo, three musicians strangely difficult\r\nto classify. They remain on the margin of all the turbulent movements\r\nin modern musical evolution. Each pursued his own way and the only\r\npoint of contact between the three, outside of their uniformly friendly\r\nrelations, is their individual isolation. Each might have turned\r\nto the other for sympathy in his loneliness. No doubt the spoiled\r\nand successful Massenet, the skeptical and mocking Saint-Saëns, and\r\nthe noble and sensitive Lalo must have felt alone in the attacks or\r\nindifference of their fellow artists. Yet, aloof as they were, each\r\nin his way has been an important influence on French music. Massenet\r\nby the essentially French character of his melody, Saint-Saëns by his\r\neminently Latin sense of form, and Lalo by the picturesque fondness\r\nfor piquant rhythms, have each woven themselves into the very texture\r\nof modern French music, Saint-Saëns and Lalo in particular being\r\npropagandists for the new and vital growth of the symphonic forms\r\nin Paris during the last three decades. If there is less of the\r\nspectacular and the intense in their productions, there are qualities\r\nthat make for a certain recognition and popularity over a relatively\r\nlonger space of time. There is nothing enigmatic or revolutionary with\r\neither. Each expressed himself with varying degrees of sincerity in an\r\nidiom which, without pointing to the future, is nevertheless of the\r\ntime in which it was written. If there are retrogressive qualities in\r\nSaint-Saëns, it must not be forgotten that he is one of the significant\r\nexponents of the symphonic poem. If Massenet attempted no revolutionary\r\nharmonic procedure, he nevertheless made a certain type of lyric opera\r\nall his own. If Lalo was content to compose in the conventional form\r\nknown as symphony, concerto, quartet, etc., he none the less endowed\r\nthem with a quality immediately personal and not present heretofore in\r\nthese forms. They are all intimately related to French music as it has\r\nbeen and as it will be.\r\n\r\n'I was born,' wrote Jules-Émile-Frédéric Massenet (1842-1912) in an\r\narticle appearing in 'Scribner's Magazine,' 'to the sound of hammers\r\nof bronze.' With this stentorian statement, which would have better\r\nserved to inaugurate the biography of a Berlioz or a Benvenuto Cellini,\r\nMassenet tells us the bare facts of a more or less colorless life. With\r\nthe exception of a few hard years during his apprenticeship at the\r\nConservatoire, Massenet remains for well over a quarter of a century\r\nthe idol, or rather the spoiled child, of the Parisian public. His\r\nreputation abroad is considerably less, the rôle of his elegant or\r\nsuperficial art being taken in Germany and America by Sig. Puccini.\r\nNevertheless, even to the American public, little interested in the\r\nrefined neuroticism of this child of the Second Empire, Massenet is not\r\ndevoid of a certain charm.\r\n\r\nTo obtain an adequate idea of his importance among the group of\r\ncomposers of the late nineteenth century it is necessary to close\r\none's ears against the railing of the snobbish élite. There is much\r\nin Massenet to criticize. If one thinks merely of the spirit which\r\nactuates his productions, one is very apt to be condemnatory. When one\r\nconsiders, however, a fluid and elegant technique such as was his,\r\nan amazing power of production that recalls the prolific masters of\r\nthe Renaissance, and a power not only to please but even to dictate\r\nto the fickle operatic tastes of a quarter-century, one must stop\r\none's criticism to murmur one's admiration. Massenet has probably\r\nnever been justly appraised. Among his compatriots the critics allied\r\nwith the young school are so vituperative as to render their opinions\r\nvalueless. His admirers show an equal lack of proportion, being\r\nofttimes friends rather than well equipped critics. Any just observer\r\nof musical history, however, must stop to consider the qualities of a\r\nman that could retain his hold upon the sympathies of a public rather\r\ndistinguished for the fickleness and injustice of its tastes. To find\r\nthe work that best exemplifies the Massenetian qualities among an opus\r\nthat includes twenty-four operas, seven orchestral suites, innumerable\r\nsongs, some chamber music, and some incidental music for various\r\npopular productions, is not easy.\r\n\r\nLet us pass his operas in rapid review. The first dramatic work of\r\nany importance is _Le Roi de Lahore_, given for the first time in\r\nApril, 1877. In this opera, as in _Hérodiade_, which followed it four\r\nyears later, there is much that has become permanently fixed in the\r\nconcert répertoire. It is doubtful whether either will ever regain\r\nits place in the theatre. With _Manon_, however, an opéra comique in\r\nfive acts, Massenet inaugurates a success that was to be undimmed\r\nuntil his death in 1912. _Manon_, since its production in 1884, has\r\nenjoyed a remarkable career of more than 1,200 productions in Paris.\r\nIt is typical, as regards the text, of the successful libretto that\r\nthe composer of _Werther_, of _Le Jongleur de Nôtre Dame_, and _Thaïs_\r\nwas to employ. Massenet in his attitude toward adaptable literary\r\nmaterial may be said to have had his ear to the ground. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that the passionate novelette of the Abbé\r\nPrévost should have attracted him, and in _Manon_ one may observe\r\nthe characteristics of the Massenetian heroine that were to make him\r\nso popular among the sensitive, subtle, spoiled, and restless women\r\nof our time. One enthusiastic biographer asserts that Massenet has\r\ntaken one masterpiece to make another. Although one must acknowledge\r\nthe undoubted charm of this fragile little opera, one cannot consider\r\nit on the same intellectual plane as that sincere epic of a young\r\nsentimentalist of the late eighteenth century. Throughout the five\r\nacts are scenes or parts of scenes that show Massenet at his best.\r\nTechnically speaking, however, the work is often inferior to the one\r\nor two little masterpieces composed later on. In it a certain crudity\r\nand hesitation of technique are often apparent. The casual mingling of\r\nmusical declamation with spoken dialogue is often unsatisfactory if\r\nnot absolutely distasteful. It is in the splendid love-scene of Saint\r\nSulpice that the composer first gives a revelation of his remarkable\r\npowers as a musico-dramatic artist.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 at Vienna was presented a work that Massenet was never to\r\nsurpass: _Werther_. This work has never attained the popularity\r\nof _Manon_, but it is infinitely superior in every detail. In it\r\nMassenet has achieved an elastic musical declamation that is almost\r\nunique in the history of opera. Throughout, with absolute deference\r\nto the principles of diction, the solo voice sings a sort of melodic\r\nrecitative skillfully accompanied by a transparent yet marvellously\r\ncolored orchestra. The comparative lack of success of _Werther_ is\r\nno doubt due to the sentimentalization of a tale already morbid\r\nwhen fresh from the pen of Goethe. Naturally in adapting it to the\r\nstage, and especially to the French stage, the idyllic charm of\r\nGoethe's extraordinary tale has been lost. Also, the glamour of its\r\nquasi-autobiographical connection with a great poet has entirely\r\nvanished. With all these qualifications, one must nevertheless--if his\r\nopinion be not too influenced by musical snobbishness--acknowledge\r\n_Werther_ to be a lyric work of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other work that could add to Massenet's reputation\r\nor show another facet of his genius, _Le Jongleur de Nôtre Dame_. This\r\nwork, founded upon a legend of the Middle Ages adapted with taste and\r\ndiscretion by Maurice Lena of the University of Paris, is a treasure\r\namong short operas. The skeptical box-holder of the theatre rejoices\r\nin the fact that there is no woman's rôle. The three brief acts centre\r\nabout the routine of a monastery and the apparition of the Virgin.\r\nMassenet has treated this innocent historiette with a tenderness and\r\ncare that belie the casual overproduction that characterized his career.\r\n\r\nAfter _Le Jongleur_ one is face to face with a sad succession of\r\nhastily composed, often mediocre, stage pieces. Upon the occasion of\r\nthe presentation of the posthumous opera _Cleopatra_ at Monte Carlo\r\nin 1914, friendly critics pointed to the renewal of Massenet's genius.\r\nAn examination of _Cleopatra_, however, reveals a deplorable use of\r\nconventional procedures with certain disagreeable mannerisms of the\r\ncomposer at their worst. _Panurge_, presented in 1913, is a better\r\nwork. No doubt in composing it Massenet wished to achieve a French\r\n_Meistersinger_. He has fallen far short of this and one is forced to\r\nconfess that the Gallic cock crows in a shrill and fragile falsetto.\r\n\r\nAmong Massenet's orchestral suites, it would be unjust to omit mention\r\nof the _Scènes Alsaciennes_. Also one can separate from the quantity\r\nof stage music composed for various dramatic pieces _Les Erynnies_,\r\ncomposed for the drama of Leconte de Lisle. An examination of the\r\ncantatas, 'Eve' in particular, is interesting as evidence of Massenet's\r\nextraordinary virtuosity.\r\n\r\nSo much for the actual works. When one considers the influence of\r\nMassenet upon the new musical school that sprang up in France after\r\nFranck, one can hardly exaggerate it. Among his pupils are many of the\r\ndistinguished young musical Nihilists of to-day, for, if we admit the\r\nmeretricious aims of Massenet in contemporary music, it is impossible\r\nnot to admit, too, that he possessed one of the most certain techniques\r\nfor the stage since Rameau. Absolutely conversant with the exactions of\r\ndramatic composition, one might say that in each bar of music he was\r\nhaunted by the foot-lights. Musically speaking, the modelling of the\r\nMassenetian melody is characterized by an elegance that is sickly and\r\ncloying. Towards the end of his career there was no need to subject\r\nhis music to the polishing that other composers find necessary. His\r\nmannerisms resolved themselves into tricks. The effect of these tricks\r\nwas so certain as to enable this skillful juggler to intersperse pages\r\nof absolutely meaningless filling. In one department of technique,\r\nhowever, one can think of little but praise--that is Massenet's clear\r\nand sonorous orchestration. He is one of the shining examples of that\r\neconomy of resources to be observed in present-day French composers.\r\nHis orchestra is that of the classics, and yet he seems to endow it\r\nwith possibilities for color and dramatic expression unknown in France,\r\nat least in the domain of theatrical composition, before his appearance.\r\n\r\nHis dominant fault is a nervous and ever-present desire to please at\r\nall costs. He had an uncanny power of estimating the receptivity of\r\naudiences and was careful not to go beyond well-defined limits. In\r\n_Esclarmonde_ there is a timid attempt to acclimate the procedures of\r\nRichard Wagner to the stage of the Opéra Comique. We cannot share the\r\nenthusiasm of some of Massenet's critics for this empty and inflated\r\nimitation. It is not good Massenet, and it is poor Wagnerism, for the\r\nreal Massenet, say what you will, is the Massenet of a few scenes\r\nof _Manon_, of the delicate moonlight reverie of _Werther_, and the\r\ncloying Meditation from _Thaïs_. The mistake of critics in appraising a\r\ncomposer like Massenet is that they assume that there is a platinum bar\r\nto standardize musical ideals. Massenet set himself to do something. He\r\nwanted to please. Haunted by the sufferings of his student life at the\r\nConservatoire, he wanted to be successful; he was eminently so. If his\r\nmeans of obtaining this success seem questionable to those of us who\r\nbelieve in a continuous evolution of art, when we are confronted with\r\nthe industry, the achievement, and the mastery of technical resources\r\nthat are to be observed in Massenet, we must unwillingly acclaim him a\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to Massenet's prodigious output. Besides\r\nhis 23 operas his works include 4 oratorios and biblical dramas,\r\nhis incidental music to any number of plays, his suites, overtures,\r\nchamber music, piano pieces and four volumes of songs, as well as _a\r\ncapella_ choruses. Massenet was a native of Montaud, near St.\r\nÉtienne (Loire), studied at the Conservatoire with Laurent (piano),\r\nReber (harmony), and Ambroise Thomas (composition). He captured the\r\nprix de Rome in 1863 with the cantata _David Rizzio_.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           French Eclectics:\r\n\r\n                      Édouard Lalo     Benjamin Godard\r\n                  Camille Saint-Saëns   Jules Massenet\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VI\r\n\r\nCharles-Camille Saint-Saëns was born October 9th, 1835, in Paris.\r\nHe lives to-day (1915) in possession of all his powers as an artist\r\nand a witty pamphleteer. In some respects Saint-Saëns may be dubbed\r\na musical Voltaire. A master of all the forms peculiar to symphonic\r\nmusic, he has never succeeded in endowing his work with any quality\r\nsave clarity and brilliance. One would almost think at times that\r\nhe deliberately stifled emotional elements in himself of which he\r\ndisapproved. There is scarcely any department of music for which he has\r\nnot written. Symphonies, chamber music, songs, operas and a ballet, and\r\nall this in quantity. Saint-Saëns, too, has undeniably lofty musical\r\nstandards. Prolific, like Massenet, too prolific, in fact, for the\r\nsubtle, sensitive taste of our time, Saint-Saëns seems rather to defy\r\nthe public than to make any effort to please. His skill as a technician\r\nand his extraordinary abilities as a virtuoso have won him immediate\r\nrecognition with musicians. In examining the whole of his work, there\r\nare only four orchestral pieces which have enduring qualities. These\r\nare the four symphonic poems in which Saint-Saëns pays an eloquent\r\ntribute to the form espoused by his friend Franz Liszt. Of these, the\r\nfinest is _Phaëton_. Strange to say, the best known of this tetralogy\r\nof masterpieces is not the best. Beside the magnificently picturesque\r\n_Phaëton_ the _Danse macabre_ seems a drab and inelegant humoresque.\r\nAfter _Phaëton_, _Le Rouet d'Omphale_ must be given the place of\r\ndistinction in the long list of Saint-Saëns's compositions. In it the\r\ncomposer has given us a witty delineation of the irresistible powers of\r\nseduction of a truly feminine woman. The delicate orchestral texture\r\nentirely made up of crystalline timbres marks Saint-Saëns as one of the\r\nsurest and most skillful manipulators of the modern orchestra since\r\nWagner. As is characteristic of many French composers, there is a\r\nremarkable economy of means. Small aggregations of instruments achieve\r\nbrilliant and compelling sonorities.\r\n\r\nIn the operatic field, Saint-Saëns is not happy. Here all of his\r\nreactionary neo-classicism found its full vent, and we are shocked to\r\nsee a musician of Saint-Saëns's taste and intelligence employing the\r\npompous conventionalities of the opera of 1850. 'Samson and Delilah,'\r\nhowever, has found its way into the répertoire no doubt on account of\r\nits fluent melodic structure and its agreeable exoticism. No matter\r\nwhat his technical excellences, one is conscious, with Saint-Saëns,\r\nof a certain sterility. Sometimes his music is so imitative of the\r\nclassics as to be absolutely devoid of any reason for being. Bach and\r\nMendelssohn are his great influences and Liszt and Berlioz have had\r\na great part in the formation of his orchestral technique. M. Schuré\r\nremarks aptly: 'One notices with him a subtle and lively imagination,\r\na constant aspiration to strength, to nobility, to majesty. From his\r\nquartets and his symphonies are to be detached grandiose moments\r\nand rockets of emotion which disappear too quickly. But it would be\r\nimpossible to find the individuality which asserts itself in the\r\nensemble of his works. One does not feel there the torment of a soul or\r\nthe pursuit of an ideal. It is the Proteus, multiform and polyphonic,\r\nof music. Try to seize him, and he changes into a siren. Are you under\r\nthe charm? He undergoes a change into a mocking bird. You believe\r\nthat you have got him at last, then he climbs into the clouds like a\r\nhypogriff. His own nature is best discerned in certain witty fantasies\r\nof a skeptical and mordant character, like the _Danse macabre_ and the\r\n_Rouet d'Omphale_.' When one considers that Saint-Saëns has been before\r\nthe public ever since the sixties, a period in which musical evolution\r\nhas undergone the most rapid and surprising changes, it is not strange\r\nthat he eludes characterization. He is a musician who has, as Mr.\r\nSchuré so aptly says, refused to set himself the narrow and rocky\r\npath of an ideal. He has consistently avoided extremes. Side by side\r\nwith Saint-Saëns the modernist, the champion of the symphonic poem,\r\nis Saint-Saëns the anti-Wagnerian. He is one of the great pillars,\r\nhowever, in the remarkable edifice of French symphonic music.\r\n\r\nWith Romain Bussine, in 1872, Saint-Saëns founded the Société\r\nNationale, an organization which was to have the most far-reaching\r\ninfluence on the development of French music. Like Lalo, Saint-Saëns\r\nworked for a sort of protective tariff to keep French symphonic music\r\nfrom being overwhelmed by the more experienced Teuton neighbors. As a\r\npamphleteer and propagandist, Saint-Saëns is full of verve and always\r\nhas the last word. He was one of the first to appreciate Wagner,\r\nbut later, feeling that the popularity of the master of Bayreuth\r\nmight overwhelm young French composers, he withdrew his sympathetic\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nÉdouard-Victor-Antoine Lalo was born in Lille in 1822. This modest,\r\naristocratic, and noble-minded musician has scarcely enjoyed his just\r\ndue even in this late day. He died, exhausted, in 1892. His whole\r\nartistic career was ill-fated. His opera, _Le Roi d'Ys_, and his ballet\r\n_Namouna_ were both indifferently successful if not absolute failures.\r\nIt is doubtful if Lalo ever recovered from the disappointment and\r\noverwork that attended the composition and production of _Namouna_.\r\nWithout hesitation we should characterize these two works as his most\r\nimportant. There is an excellent symphony in G minor, a concerto for\r\n'cello, the _Symphonie Espagnole_ for violin and orchestra, and a\r\nconcerto for piano, all of an equally lofty musical texture. It is\r\ndifficult to class Lalo with any group of musicians. He was mildly\r\ninfluenced by Wagner, as were all young musicians of his time, and yet\r\n_Le Roi d'Ys_ is absolutely his own. Lalo came of Spanish parentage.\r\nIt is probable that a certain sort of atavism is responsible for the\r\nconstant suggestion of the subtle monotony of Spanish rhythms in his\r\nmusic. He is too distinct a Latin to be overwhelmed by Wagner.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that Lalo will never be genuinely popular. The\r\n_Symphonie Espagnole_ is in the répertoire of every virtuoso violinist.\r\nThe same may be said of the concerto for 'cello, and yet it is doubtful\r\nif the layman of symphonic concerts would complain were he never\r\nagain to hear anything of Lalo. This is due to a certain aristocratic\r\naloofness, and emotional reserve, and an ever-present sense of\r\nproportion dear only to the élite.\r\n\r\nLalo's influence was not in itself far-reaching. A sincere, splendidly\r\ndeveloped artist, he had none of the qualities that make disciples. As\r\none of a group of musicians, however, that were to play an important\r\nrôle in saving French music from foreign domination and in finding an\r\nidiom characteristic and worthy of a country possessed of the artistic\r\ntraditions of France, Lalo cannot be overestimated. As a member of\r\nthe Armingaud quartet he worked fervently to create a taste for\r\nsymphonic music. His own dignified symphonic productions supplemented\r\nthis necessary work of propaganda, for it must not be forgotten that\r\nfor almost a century before the advent of César Franck there was no\r\nFrench symphonic music. The French genius, insofar as it expressed\r\nitself in music at all, turned rather to the historical opera so\r\npompously fashioned, or the witty and amusing opéra comique. Lalo must\r\nbe considered with Saint-Saëns and Franck as one of the pioneers in\r\nmaking a regenerate Parisian taste. His life is colorless and offers\r\nlittle to the critic in interpretation of his musical ideals. Lalo\r\ncomposed silently, with conviction, and without self-consciousness. He\r\nwas singularly without theories. Concrete technical problems absorbed\r\nhim, and in the refinement and nobility of his music is to be found\r\nthe most eloquent essay upon the rôle of an artist who seeks sincere\r\nself-expression rather than general recognition.\r\n\r\nAs a leaven to the frivolous musical tastes prevalent in the French\r\ncapital before the last three decades Lalo has played his part nobly.\r\nHe will always be admired by all sincere musicians. His art is\r\ncomplete, devoid of mannerisms, plastically perfect, and yet without\r\nthe semblance of dryness. In his symphony one will observe an unerring\r\nsense of form, an exquisite clarity of orchestration, and a happy\r\nchoice of ideas suitable for development, _Le Roi d'Ys_ is scarcely\r\na masterpiece. The text is constructed from a pretty folk-story,\r\nis not very dramatic and occasionally gives one the impression of\r\namateurishness and puerility. The music is exquisite and makes\r\none regret that Lalo could not have found other and more suitable\r\nvehicles for his dramatic genius. _Namouna_ is a sparkling, colorful\r\nballet. When it was revived some years ago, a more propitious public\r\nenthusiastically revised the adverse verdict of 1882.\r\n\r\nLittle may be said of Benjamin Godard (1849-95) except that he\r\nwrote much, too much perhaps, in nearly all forms: symphonies (with\r\ncharacteristic titles, such as the 'Gothic,' 'Oriental,' _Symphonie\r\nlégendaire_), concertos for violin and for piano, orchestral\r\nsuites, dramatic overture, symphony, a lyric scene, chamber music,\r\npiano pieces, over a hundred songs, etc. Few of these are heard\r\nnowadays, even in France perhaps. Neither are his operas, _Pédro de\r\nZalaméa_ (1884), _Jocelyn_ (1888), _Dante et Béatrice_ (1890), _Ruy\r\nBlas_ (1891), _La Vivandière_ (1895), and _Les Guelfes_ (1902).\r\n_Jocelyn_--and, indeed, its composer--are perpetuated by the charmingly\r\nsentimental _Berceuse_, beloved of amateur violinists. Godard studied\r\ncomposition with Reber and violin with Vieuxtemps at the Conservatoire.\r\nHe won the _grand prix_ for composition awarded by the city of\r\nParis with the dramatic symphony 'Tasso.' This, like the _Symphonie\r\nlégendaire_, employs a chorus and solo voices in combination with the\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\nTwo composers, noted especially for their organ works, should\r\nbe mentioned in conclusion: Alexandre Guilmant (born 1837) and\r\nCharles-Marie Widor (born 1845). Both made world-wide reputations as\r\nvirtuosos upon the organ, the former in the _Trinité_, the latter in\r\n_St. Sulpice_ in Paris. Guilmant has travelled over the world and\r\nreceived the world's plaudits; Widor has remained in Paris while droves\r\nof pupils from all over the globe have gone back to their homes and\r\nhave spread his fame. Both have composed copiously for the organ,\r\nGuilmant more exclusively so, also editing and arranging a great deal\r\nfor his instrument. Widor has written two symphonies, choral works,\r\nchamber music, and piano pieces, songs, etc., even a ballet, _La\r\nKorrigane_, two grand operas, _Nerto_ and _Les Pêcheurs de St. Jean_,\r\na comic opera and a pantomime, _Jeanne d'Arc_. He is César Franck's\r\nsuccessor as professor of organ at the Conservatoire, and since 1891\r\nhas taken Dubois' place in the chair of composition.\r\n\r\n                                                         C.

One can almost see\r\nin its turbulent-lugubrious or buoyant-hilarious chords the rich colors\r\nof the Byzantine style, the half Oriental atmosphere that surrounds\r\neverything with a romantic halo--gloomy prisons, wild mountains, wide\r\nsteppes, luxurious palaces and churches, idyllic villages and the\r\nlonely penal colonies of Siberia. It really visualizes the life of the\r\nempire of the Czar with a marvellous power. With its short history and\r\nthe unique position that it occupies among the world's classics, it\r\ndepicts the true type of a Slav, the melancholy, simple and hospitable\r\n_moujik_, with more fullness of color and virility than, for instance,\r\nthe German or Italian compositions depict the representative types\r\nof those nations. In order to understand the reason of this peculiar\r\ndifference between Russian and West European music it is necessary to\r\nunderstand the social and psychological elements upon which it is built.\r\n\r\nWhile the West European composers founded their creations upon the\r\ntraditions of the masters, Russian music grew out of the very heart,\r\nthe joys and the sorrows of the common people. All the Russian\r\ncomposers of the early nationalistic era were men of active life, who\r\nbecame musicians only on the urgency of their inspiration. Glinka, for\r\ninstance, was a functionary in the Ministry of Finance, Dargomijsky was\r\na clerk in the Treasury Department, Moussorgsky was an army officer,\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff an officer of the navy, Borodine was a celebrated\r\ninventor and scholar. Academic musicians are wont to find the stamp of\r\namateurishness on most of the Russian classic music. To this Stassoff,\r\nthe celebrated Russian critic, replied: 'If that is the case, our\r\ncomposers are only to be congratulated, for they have not considered\r\nthe form, the objective issues, but the spirit, the subjective value of\r\ntheir inspirations. We may be uneven and amateurish as nature and human\r\nlife are, but, thank Heaven, we are not artificial and sophisticated!'\r\n\r\nBe it a song, instrumental composition, or opera, everything in Russian\r\nmusic breathes the ethnographic and social-psychologic peculiarities\r\nof the race, which is semi-Oriental in its foundations. Nationalism in\r\nmusic has been the watchword of most of the Russian composers since\r\nthe very start. But, besides, there has been a strong tendency to\r\nsubjective individualism, that often expresses itself in a wealth of\r\nsad nuances. This has been to a great extent the reason that foreigners\r\nconsider melancholy the predominant racial quality, a view not just\r\nto Russian music as a whole, which is far too vigorous and healthy\r\na growth to remain continuously under the sway of one emotional\r\ninfluence. To a foreign, especially an Anglo-Saxon ear Russian\r\nmusic may sound sometimes too realistic, sometimes too monotonous\r\nand sad without any obvious reason. It has been declared by foreign\r\nacademicians lacking in cohesion, technique, and convincing unity.\r\nHowever, this is not a defect of Russian art, but a characteristic\r\ntrait of its racial soul. Every Russian artist, be he a composer,\r\nwriter, or painter, in avoiding artificiality puts into his creation\r\nall the idiomatic peculiarities of his race without polishing out of it\r\nthe vigor of 'naturalness.' Russian music, more than any other Russian\r\nart, expresses in all its archaic lines, soft shades, and polyphonic\r\nharmonies the peculiar temperament of the nation, which is just as\r\nrestless and unbalanced as its life.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental purpose of the pathfinders of Russian music was to\r\ncreate beauties that emanated, not from a certain class or school,\r\nbut directly from the soul of the masses. Their ideal was to create\r\nlife from life. In order to accomplish their tasks they went back to\r\nmelodic traditions of early mediæval music, to the folk-songs, the\r\nmythological chants and the folk dances. Since the Russian people are\r\nextremely musical, folk-song is a great factor in the nation's life and\r\nevolution. Music accompanies _moujiks_ from the cradle to the grave\r\nand plays a leading rôle in their social ceremonies. Though profound\r\nmelancholy seems to be the dominant note, yet along with the gloom are\r\nalso reckless hilarity and boisterous humor, which often whirl one off\r\none's feet, as, notably, in Glinka's _Kamarinskaya_. The phenomenon is\r\nstartling, for music of the deepest melancholy swings unexpectedly to\r\nbuoyant humor and exultant joy. This is explained by the fact that the\r\naverage Russian is extremely emotional and consequently dramatic in his\r\nartistic expression. Very characteristic is a passage of Leo Tolstoy on\r\nRussian folk-song in which he writes:\r\n\r\n'It is both sad and joyous, on a quiet summer evening, to hear the\r\nsweeping song of the peasants. In it is yearning without end, without\r\nhope, also power invisible, the fateful stamp of destiny, and the faith\r\nin preordination, one of the fundamental principles of our race, which\r\nexplains much that in Russian life seems incomprehensible.'\r\n\r\nThe early Russian composers thus became creators in touch with the\r\ncommon people, the very opposite of the composers of German and Latin\r\nraces, who created only for the salons of aristocracy. The latter\r\nwere and remained strangers to the people among whom they lived.\r\nEverything they composed was strictly academic and expressed all the\r\nsentimentality and stateliness of the nobility. Although geniuses of\r\ngreat technique, in racial color, emotional quickness and spontaneity\r\nthey remain behind the Russians.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that all the early Russian composers were\r\ndescendants of aristocracy, they remained in their feelings and in\r\ntheir themes, like Gogol, Dostoievsky, and Turgenieff in fiction,\r\ntrue portrayers of the common people's life. There has never been an\r\naristocratic opera, a nobility music and salon influence noticeable\r\nin Russian musical development. This may be due to the fact that\r\nthe Russian aristocracy is not a privileged superior class of the\r\nautocratic régime, as is that of Germany, Austria, Italy, and England,\r\nbut merely an intellectual, more advanced element of the country.\r\nThanks to Czar Feodor, the father of Peter the Great, who destroyed\r\nall the pedigrees, patents and papers of the nobility, saying that he\r\ndid not want to see their snobbery and intrigue in his empire, there\r\nare no family documents in Russia which go back beyond the reign of\r\nCzar Feodor. There is no doubt that this autocratic proceeding has been\r\nbeneficial to Russian art, particularly to music, in having made it\r\ndemocratic in its very foundations.\r\n\r\nThough music has been cultivated in Russia since the time of Peter\r\nthe Great, the origin of the true nationalistic school belongs to the\r\nNapoleonic era, the reigns of Alexander I and Nicholas I. Cosmopolitan\r\nthat he was, Peter the Great disliked everything national, and invited\r\nItalian musicians to form a school of systematic musical education in\r\nhis empire. But Catherine II became deeply interested in encouraging\r\nnative music and herself took an active part in the work. Between\r\nher political schemings and romantic affairs, she took time to write\r\nlibrettos, to invite musicians to her palace and to instruct them how\r\nto use the themes of the folk plays, fairy tales, and choral dances\r\nfor a new Russian stage music. It is said that sixty new operas were\r\nwritten during her reign and produced on the stage of the newly-founded\r\nmunicipal opera house. One of them, 'Annette,' is quoted as the first\r\nwholly Russian opera, in librettist, theme, and composer.\r\n\r\nA very conspicuous figure of the pre-nationalistic period of Russian\r\nmusical history is C. Cavos (1776-1840), an Italian by birth, but a\r\nSlav in his work. He wrote songs, instrumental music and operas, more\r\nor less in Italian style but employing both Russian text and theme. His\r\nopera, 'Ivan Sussanin,' was considered a sensational novelty and the\r\ncomposer was hailed as a great genius of the country. But his works\r\ndied as soon as they had loomed up under the protection of the court\r\nand nothing of his compositions has survived.\r\n\r\nClose upon Cavos followed Verstovsky, whose operas 'Tomb of Askold' and\r\n'Pan Tvardovsky' were produced in Moscow when Napoleon invaded Russia\r\nin 1812. The first was built upon an old Slavic saga in which _Askold_,\r\nthe hero, and his brother, _Dir_, play the same rôles as do Hengist and\r\nHorsa in Saxon chronicles. The other was founded upon an old Polish\r\nstory of adventure somewhat resembling the Faust legend. Besides the\r\noperas Verstovsky composed a large number of songs, ballads, and\r\ndances. By birth a Pole and by education an Italian, his compositions\r\nresemble in many ways those of Rubinstein.\r\n\r\nRussian musical conditions in the first half of the past century\r\nwere very much like those in America at present. Besides Cavos\r\nand Verstovsky there had been and were a number of more or less\r\nconspicuous imitators of the Italian school. Their works were as\r\nlittle Russian in character as Puccini's 'Girl of the Golden West'\r\nis American. But the advent of Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert in\r\nGermany made a deep impression upon the music-loving Russians. The\r\nmen upon whom the romantic German music made the strongest impression\r\nwere Glinka and Dargomijsky, both inclined toward romantic ideals and\r\nthemes. Their first striking move was to rebel against the Italian\r\ninfluences. 'Russia, like Germany, shall have its own music independent\r\nof all academic schools and foreign flavors, and it shall be a music\r\nof the masses. Music is more vigorous and more individual when it is\r\nnational. We like individuality in life and literature, as in all arts\r\nand politics. Why should the world not cling more to the racial than to\r\nthe cosmopolitan ideal? The tendency of Italian music is cosmopolitan.\r\nI believe that the tempo of music must correspond to the tempo of life.\r\nOur duty is to speak for all the nation.' Thus Glinka wrote at the\r\ncritical moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nNaturally Glinka's first attempts were ridiculed by contemporary salon\r\ncritics and concert habitués, who looked at him as a 'moujik-maniac'\r\nand naïve dilettante. His attempt at something truly national in\r\ncharacter was considered plebeian and undignified for a nobleman. But,\r\nencouraged by Shukovsky, the famous poet of that time and the tutor of\r\nthe heir-apparent, later Czar Alexander II, Glinka published in 1833\r\nthe first volume of his songs and ballads, based purely on themes of\r\nfolk-songs. As he was merely a functionary of the Ministry of Finance,\r\nwithout any systematic musical training and had no professional\r\nprestige, his work was ignored by the press, while society merely made\r\nfun of him and his songs. It was evident that he could not get any\r\nhearing in this way.\r\n\r\nShukovsky, whose apartment at the palace was a rendezvous of artists\r\nand reformers of that time, suggested to Glinka that he compose an\r\nopera out of the rich material in his unpublished ballads, songs, and\r\ninstrumental sketches, and he on his part would take care that it\r\nshould be produced on the imperial stage. Shukovsky even outlined a\r\nlibretto on an historical subject similar to that used by Cavos and\r\nsuggested to name it 'A Death for the Czar.' Baron Rosen, the poetic\r\nprivate secretary of the Czarevitch, wrote the libretto under the\r\nsupervision of Shukovsky and Glinka named it 'A Life for the Czar.'\r\nThis was the first distinctly national Russian opera that stands\r\napart from the Italian and German style. Instead of effective airs\r\nand elaborate orchestration Glinka emphasized the use of choruses and\r\nspectacular scenic methods, which are more natural to Russian life than\r\nthe former. When the opera was produced in 1837 for the first time in\r\nSt. Petersburg the people went wild about it and the young composer was\r\nhailed as a great æsthetic reformer. The czar appointed him to act as\r\na conductor of the court choir, the famous _pridvornaya kapella_. The\r\nphenomenal success embittered the professional musicians of Russia and\r\nthey began to fight the composer with redoubled vigor.\r\n\r\nFortunately the czar, and especially Shukovsky, were on the side of\r\nGlinka, so that all the intrigues of his enemies failed. Meanwhile he\r\nhad composed several songs and a large number of ballads and orchestral\r\npieces, of which _Kamarinskaya_ and the 'Spanish Overture' are the most\r\nknown. Glinka's songs and instrumental pieces are full of melody and\r\ncolor, and they are still sung and played in Russia, but the best he\r\nhas created are his two operas. In 1842 he finished his second opera,\r\n'Russlan and Liudmilla,' which, though more poetic and melodious\r\nthan 'A Life for the Czar', failed to arouse the enthusiasm which had\r\ngreeted his first opera. The reason for that may have been that it was\r\ndistinctly democratic and not historical, and historical pieces were a\r\nfad of that time.\r\n\r\nMikhail Ivanovich Glinka was born in 1804, in the province of\r\nSmolensk, and his father, a wealthy nobleman, sent him at the age of\r\nthirteen to be educated in an aristocratic college in St. Petersburg.\r\nThe young man was intended for the civil service of the government,\r\nbut he loved music so passionately that he neglected his other studies\r\nand took lessons in piano and the theory of composition from various\r\nteachers of the capital until he was about to be expelled from the\r\nschool. Graduated in 1824, he tried to get a position in the treasury\r\ndepartment, but, failing in this, continued to study music till he\r\nsecured it. Beethoven, Weber, and Schubert made a lasting impression\r\nupon his mind and he never ceased to worship them, though he never\r\nimitated them. Byron, Goethe, and Pushkin were the poets that inspired\r\nhim most of all, and he used to say if he could be in his native music\r\nwhat those men had been in their native poetry he would die a happy man.\r\n\r\nWith all his lack of technical skill, Glinka remains the founder of\r\nthe nationalistic school of music of his native land. In spite of his\r\nmany shortcomings he is natural and superior to the opera composers\r\nof his time in Italy and Germany. As all Russians have inborn love of\r\nsong and as that is expressed in manifold ways in their actual life\r\nmore than in the life of any other nation, Glinka's main idea was to\r\nfound the Russian opera on combined passages of realistic musical life,\r\ngiving them a dramatic character. To emphasize this he made use of\r\npicturesque stage glitter and spectacular scenic effects. This betrays\r\nitself forcibly in the vivid colors that outline the semi-Oriental\r\narchitecture of a cathedral, palace, public building or cottage, or in\r\nthe picturesque costumes for marriage, for burial and for the various\r\nother social and official ceremonies characteristic of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn his private life Glinka was just as unfortunate as Tschaikowsky. The\r\ngirl he had begun to love passionately married a man of more promising\r\nsocial career. He married a woman whom he did not love and they were\r\ndivorced after some scandal and difficulty. Then the woman whom he had\r\nfirst loved and who was married to a prominent army officer changed her\r\nmind and eloped with Glinka. In order to avoid a public scandal the\r\nczar forced the composer to relinquish the woman of his choice. Glinka\r\nobeyed and fell into a mood of melancholy which undermined his health\r\nlittle by little until he died in Berlin in 1857. But, strange to say,\r\nthe private life of Glinka did not affect his compositions, for there\r\nis nothing extremely melancholy or sentimentally sad in his music. An\r\nair of sentimental romanticism emanates from his numerous ballads,\r\nsongs, and instrumental works. Like the rest of his contemporaries he\r\nis lyric, full of color and sentiment in his minor works. One and all\r\nare distinctly national.\r\n\r\nTogether with Glinka, Dargomijsky undertook to carry the idea of\r\nnationalism in music into practice, in spite of all the objections of\r\ncontemporaries. They met frequently and became close friends. Their\r\naspirations were the same, though Glinka was socially prominent by\r\nreason of his official position, and Dargomijsky was a mere clerk in\r\nthe treasury department and composed chiefly for his own pleasure.\r\nIt was much more difficult for him than for Glinka to obtain social\r\nrecognition, though the majority of his works are far more national\r\nand artistic than Glinka's. His songs stand close to the heart of the\r\n_moujik_. 'Glinka is an artist of the nobility, I am of the peasants,'\r\nwas the way Dargomijsky defined the difference between Glinka and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBorn on February 2, 1813, in the province of Tula, Alexander\r\nSergeyevitch Dargomijsky was the son of a postal official, who lost his\r\nposition and property in Moscow when Napoleon occupied that city. The\r\nboy grew up in great poverty and the only education he received was\r\nthat given by his parents. At the age of twenty he made a trip to St.\r\nPetersburg and managed to get the position of clerk in the treasury\r\ndepartment. Here he continued his studies in music, which had been\r\nnear his heart since early childhood. After a few years of strenuous\r\nwork he realized that it was more important for him to collect and\r\nstudy folk-music than to acquire the technique and theory of the art of\r\nmusic, and with this in view he undertook excursions to the villages\r\nduring the summer vacation, collecting folk-songs, attending festivals\r\nand social ceremonies of the peasants. In this way he stored up a huge\r\nmaterial and knowledge for his individual work. His first attempt was a\r\nseries of songs and ballads. In 1842 Dargomijsky resigned his official\r\nposition to devote his time exclusively to music. His first opera,\r\n'Esmeralda,' had a great success in Moscow and gave him some prestige\r\nand courage to undertake the composition of his second opera, 'The\r\nTriumph of Bacchus,' which, however, was a failure.\r\n\r\nDargomijsky's masterpiece is and remains his opera _Russalka_ ('The\r\nNymph'), which is composed to a libretto based upon a poem of Pushkin.\r\nIt takes a listener to the picturesque and romantic banks of the\r\nDnieper River, where the heroine, Natasha, the daughter of a miller, is\r\ndeserted by a princely lover. In despair she flings herself into the\r\nriver and is at once surrounded by a throng of the _russalkas_--the\r\nnymphs, with whom Russian imagination has populated every brook, lake,\r\nand river. She herself becomes a nymph and eventually succeeds in\r\nenticing her false lover to her arms beneath the water.\r\n\r\nDargomijsky's last opera, 'The Marble Guest,' for the libretto of which\r\nhe used the poetic drama of Pushkin, based on the legend of Don Juan,\r\nwas produced only after his death in 1872. It differs from his previous\r\noperas by the predominance of recitative, concerted pieces being almost\r\nbanished. Like Glinka, he was not over-prolific in his compositions.\r\nBesides the four operas he wrote only five or six orchestral pieces,\r\nsome thirty songs and ballads and a few dances. Tschaikowsky complained\r\nbitterly that he was too lazy, although he admitted that Dargomijsky\r\nwas greatly hampered by lack of systematic musical education.\r\n\r\nLike Glinka, Dargomijsky was unhappy in his private life. The woman\r\nwhom he loved so deeply was the wife of another man, and the one who\r\nloved him found no response on his part. He was relieved of his worries\r\nfor daily bread after his _Russalka_ made a success on the stage.\r\nHis apartment was the real rendezvous of the group of young Russian\r\nnationalistic composers who surpassed him by far in their works, such\r\nas Borodine, Moussorgsky, Balakireff, César Cui, Rimsky-Korsakoff, and\r\nSeroff. Dargomijsky died in 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the Balakireff group of Russian nationalists\r\nbegan its work in St. Petersburg a romantic temple was founded\r\nby Rubinstein. Among the masters of Russian music he occupies an\r\ninteresting place, being, as it were, a link between the lyric\r\nOriental and the nationalistic Slav. In many ways he was a phenomenal\r\nfigure. Though he laid the corner-stone of the modern Russian musical\r\npedagogic system and was a dominant authority of his time, he never\r\ncaught the true national spirit of Russia and by no means all his\r\ntalented pupils became his followers. He died a man disappointed in\r\nhis ideals and ambitions. 'All I care about after my death is that men\r\nshall remember me by this conservatory; let them say, this was Anton\r\nRubinstein's work,' he said, pointing to the Imperial Conservatory in\r\nSt. Petersburg,[8] of which he had been not only the founder but the\r\ndirector for many years.\r\n\r\nDuring all his influential life Rubinstein was bitterly opposed to\r\nthe Russian nationalistic school of music, at the head of which\r\nstood Balakireff, Moussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakoff. He referred to\r\nthem as to dabblers and eccentric amateurs. Even toward his pupil,\r\nTschaikowsky, he assumed a condescending attitude. His veneration of\r\nthe classics was almost fanatical. In the genius of his contemporaries\r\nhe had no faith. He truly believed that music ended with Chopin. Even\r\nWagner and Liszt were small figures in his eyes. To the realistic style\r\ninitiated by Berlioz and the music dramas of Wagner he was indifferent.\r\nHis aspirations were for the highest type of pure music, but he lacked\r\nthe ability to transform his own ideals into something real. Lyric\r\nromanticism was all he cared for. The slightest innovation in form,\r\nall attempts at realism in music, upset his æsthetic measuring scale.\r\nBut, despite his deficiencies and faults, he deserves more credit from\r\nposterity than it seems willing to accede to him. Saint-Saëns has said:\r\nI have heard Rubinstein's music reproached for its structure, its large\r\nplan, its vast stretches, its carelessness in detail. The public taste\r\nto-day calls for complications without end, arabesques, and incessant\r\nmodulations; but this is a fashion and nothing more. It seems to me\r\nthat his fruitfulness, grand character and personality suffice to class\r\nRubinstein among the greatest musicians of all times.'\r\n\r\nThe outspoken romanticism of Rubinstein's works is in a sense akin to\r\nthe spirit of Byron's poems. There is a passionate sweetness in\r\nhis melodies that one finds rarely in composers of his type. But in\r\ngiving overmuch attention to objective form, he often missed subjective\r\nwarmth, especially in his operas and his larger instrumental works. He\r\nachieved the greatest success in his songs of Oriental character, from\r\nwhich there breathes the spirit of a heavy tropic night. But in these\r\nhis best moments he remains exotic and inexplicable to our Occidental\r\nears.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         Russian Romanticists:\r\n\r\n              Mikhail Glinka         Alexander Dargomijsky\r\n        Peter Ilyitch Tschaikowsky     Anton Rubinstein\r\n\r\nRomantic as his music was the course of Rubinstein's life. He himself,\r\naccording to Rimsky-Korsakoff, blamed the romantic incidents of his\r\nlife for his shortcomings. 'I was spoiled by the flattery of high\r\nsociety, which I received during my first concert tour as a boy of\r\nthirteen,' Rubinstein told his brother composer. 'It made me conceited\r\nand fanatical. The misery that I endured later wasted the best creative\r\nyears of my life, and the sudden success which followed my acquaintance\r\nwith the Grand Duchess Helen [the sister of the Czar, who loved him]\r\nkilled my aspirations for the higher work by making me unexpectedly\r\nthe dictator of Russian musical education. If I had worked up step by\r\nstep by my own efforts I would have reached the goal of my ambition.'\r\nAt any rate the unusual career of Rubinstein explains the psychological\r\nside of his achievements and disappointments. Born in 1829 in the\r\nvillage of Vichvatinetz, in the Province of Podolia, in southwestern\r\nRussia, he began to study the piano at the age of eight in Moscow.\r\nHis teacher, Alexander Villoing, at once realized that his pupil was\r\na genius and for five years spent his best efforts upon him. When\r\nthe boy was thirteen his teacher undertook a concert tour with him,\r\nfirst through Russia, later abroad. Rubinstein was a pianistic marvel\r\nand was received everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm. Chopin and\r\nLiszt declared him a 'wonder child.' After three years of touring he\r\nsettled in Paris, lived in princely style and spent all the money he\r\nhad earned. Feeling the pinch of poverty, he went to Vienna to secure\r\nthe influence of Liszt, who advised him to go to Berlin and gave\r\nhim letters of introduction. There he found the city in a state of\r\nrevolution and abandoned by society. In despair and almost starving,\r\nRubinstein pushed on to St. Petersburg, where the once celebrated\r\nprodigy began to earn his living with piano lessons at fifty cents\r\nuntil by a mere chance he secured the position of pianist in the court\r\nchoir. At this time he composed his first opera, _Dimitry Donskoi_,\r\nwhich was performed with some success.\r\n\r\nRubinstein now undertook another trip to Liszt, at Weimar, and there he\r\nmet the Grand Duchess Helen, who at once invited the young pianist to\r\nbe her guest in Italy. This was the beginning of his career. In 1856\r\nRubinstein composed some of his songs and piano pieces and soon after\r\nthis the Imperial Conservatory of Music was founded in St. Petersburg\r\nand Moscow with the Grand Duchess as patroness. In 1862 Rubinstein\r\nbecame the director of the conservatory in St. Petersburg and held the\r\nposition until 1867 and later from 1887 to 1891. In 1865 he married\r\nand made his residence at Peterhof, where he lived in close touch with\r\nRussian society. During this period of power and comfort Rubinstein\r\ncomposed his sonatas, symphonies, operas, and piano pieces, few of\r\nwhich are ever performed nowadays.\r\n\r\nRubinstein's orchestral and operatic works occupy a place between\r\nSchumann and Meyerbeer. His most popular orchestral compositions are\r\n'Faust,' 'Ivan IV,' 'Don Quixote,' and his Second Symphony, 'Ocean.'\r\nThe other five symphonies are rather stately, cold tone pictures\r\nwithout any definite foundation. More known, and even frequently\r\nperformed, are his chamber music pieces, the 'cello sonata in D major,\r\nand the trio in B major. Of his operas and oratorios only one work,\r\n'The Demon,' has survived in the classic Russian répertoire. The rest\r\nare long forgotten. Of longer life than Rubinstein's orchestral and\r\noperatic compositions are his piano pieces, especially his barcarolles,\r\npreludes, études, and dances. All of his larger piano pieces are,\r\nlike his orchestral works, prolix, diffuse and full of unassimilated\r\nideas. Through all his compositions there blows a breath of Oriental\r\nromanticism, something that reminds one of the 'Thousand and One\r\nNights.' A peculiar sweetness and brilliancy of harmony distinguish\r\nhis style, but these particular qualities make Rubinstein unpopular\r\nin our realistic age. It is true that his piano pieces have little\r\nthat is individual, but they are graceful and aristocratic. To an ear\r\nattuned to modern impressionism they are nothing but graceful, warmly\r\ncolored salon pieces devoid of arresting features. But whatever may\r\nbe the fate of Rubinstein's instrumental music, he was a composer of\r\nexcellent songs, which will be sung as long as man lives. They are the\r\nvery crown of his creations. From among his numerous ballads and songs\r\n'The Asra,' 'The Dream,' 'Night,' etc., are especially enchanting. In\r\nthem he stands unmatched by any composer of his time. The number of\r\nhis works surpasses one hundred; there are ten string quartets, three\r\nquintets, five concertos, three sonatas for violin and piano, two for\r\n'cello and piano, two for violin and orchestra. According to Russian\r\ncritical opinion he was an imitator of Mendelssohn and Schumann. But\r\nthe fact is he suffered from the overwhelming influence of the German\r\nclassics, whom he did not assimilate thoroughly, and from being one of\r\nthe greatest of piano virtuosi of his age, which absorbed most of his\r\nattention and time. It is not unnatural that a great executive artist\r\nshould acquire the forms of those composers whose works he performs\r\nmost. In following these models Rubinstein simply demonstrated a\r\npsychological rule.\r\n\r\nRubinstein's main importance in Russian music resides in the fact\r\nthat he laid the foundation of a nation-wide musical education, so\r\nthat now the national and local governments are back of a serious\r\næsthetic culture. Besides having been twice a director of the Imperial\r\nConservatory of Music in St. Petersburg, he was from time to time a\r\ndirector of the Imperial Musical Society and conductor of the St.\r\nPetersburg symphony concerts. He died in 1894 in Peterhof and is buried\r\nin the graveyard of Alexandro-Nevsky monastery, near to his rivals,\r\nBalakireff, Borodine, and Moussorgsky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nAn artist of the same school as Rubinstein, yet entirely different in\r\nworks and spirit, was Peter Ilyitch Tschaikowsky. Rubinstein was a\r\ncreative virtuoso, Tschaikowsky was a creative genius. They took the\r\nsame general direction in form and themes, but otherwise a wide abyss\r\nseparated these two unique spirits of Russian music. Tschaikowsky\r\nhad Rubinstein's passion and technical skill, the same lyric style,\r\nand, like him, adhered to West European form, but in his essentials\r\nhe remains a Russian of the most classic tendencies; his language is\r\nthat of an emotional Slav. His music glows with the peculiar fire that\r\nburned in his soul; rapture and agony, gloom and gayety seem in a\r\nperpetual struggle for expression. With all its nationalistic riches\r\nthere is nothing in Tschaikowsky's tonal structures that resembles\r\nthose of his contemporaries. He is a romantic poet of classic pattern,\r\nyet wholly a Russian. He is altogether introspective, sentimentally\r\nsubjective, and ecclesiastically fanatic. With all his Slavic pathos\r\nand subjective vigor Tschaikowsky builds his tone-temples in Gothic\r\nstyle, which he never leaves. That is very largely the reason why his\r\nmusic is so phenomenally popular abroad, while his contemporaries have,\r\ndespite their originality and greatness, remained in his shadow.\r\n\r\nTschaikowsky's compositions are as strange as his inner self. His\r\nlikening his artistic expressions to a violent contest between a\r\nbeast and a god no doubt had its psychological reason. That there is\r\nmuch mystery in his life and its relation to his art is apparent from\r\nthe following passage with which Kashkin, his biographer, closes his\r\nbook,[9] 'I have finished my reminiscences. Of course, they might be\r\nsupplemented by accounts of a few more events, but I shall add nothing\r\nat present, and perhaps I shall never do so. One document I shall leave\r\nin a sealed packet, and if thirty years hence it still has interest for\r\nthe world the seal may be broken; this packet I shall leave in the care\r\nof Moscow University. It will contain the history of one episode in\r\nTschaikowsky's life upon which I have barely touched in my book.'\r\n\r\nThat seal is still unbroken. All we can guess of the nature of the\r\nsecret is that it involves a tragedy of romantic character. We shall\r\nget a closer idea of the great composer when we consider a few\r\ncharacteristic episodes of his private life in connection with his\r\ncareer as a musician. Peter Ilyitch Tschaikowsky was born in 1840,\r\nin the province of Viatka, where his father was the general manager\r\nof Kamsko-Botkin's Mills. He showed already in his early youth a\r\ngreat liking for music and poetry, but the wish of his parents was\r\nthat he should make his career as an official of the government. With\r\nthis in view he was educated in the aristocratic law school in St.\r\nPetersburg. Graduated in 1859, he became an officer in the department\r\nof the Ministry of Justice. While he was a student in the law school\r\nhe kept up his studies of music by taking lessons from F. D. Becker\r\nand K. I. Karel and did not give them up even when he became an\r\nactive functionary with less leisure than before. The desire for a\r\nthorough musical education gave him no peace until he entered the newly\r\nfounded Conservatory of Music, where Rubinstein and Zarembi became\r\nhis teachers. Though regularly the course was longer, Tschaikowsky\r\nwas graduated after three years of study, in 1866, and at once was\r\ninvited to become a professor of harmony in the Imperial Conservatory\r\nof Music in Moscow. During the first years of his life as a teacher\r\nTschaikowsky composed some smaller instrumental and vocal pieces, which\r\nwere performed with marked success, partly by his pupils, partly by\r\ntouring musical artists. His first large compositions were the First\r\nSymphony, which he composed in 1868, and his opera _Voyevoda_, which he\r\nwrote a year later. Both these compositions were less successful than\r\nhis earlier ones. Nevertheless the disappointment did not discourage\r\nthe young composer, for he proceeded to compose new operas, 'Undine,'\r\n_Opritchnik_, and 'Vakula the Smith,' besides some music for orchestra.\r\nIn 1873 he composed the ballet 'Snow Maiden,' and then followed in\r\nsuccession his Second, Third, and Fourth Symphonies.\r\n\r\nAssured of a pension of three thousand rubles ($1,500) a year and an\r\nextra income from the royalty of his published music, Tschaikowsky\r\nresigned his teaching post and devoted all his time to composition.\r\nHis Fourth Symphony had to some extent satisfied his ambition as a\r\nsymphonic composer, since it had been received enthusiastically by the\r\npublic in both Moscow and St. Petersburg; he now threw all his efforts\r\ninto opera. In 1878 he finished his _Evgheny Onegin_, his greatest\r\nopera, besides his two ballets.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his stormy private life and various romantic conflicts\r\nTschaikowsky was a prolific worker. Besides the above-mentioned operas\r\nhe wrote six symphonies, of which the last two have gained world-wide\r\nfame, three ballets, the overtures 'Romeo and Juliet,' 'The Tempest,'\r\n'Hamlet,' and '1812,' the 'Italian Caprice,' and the symphonic\r\npoem 'Manfred.' Besides these he wrote two concertos for piano and\r\norchestra, one concerto for violin, three quartets, one trio, over a\r\nhundred songs, some thirty smaller instrumental pieces and a series\r\nof excellent church music. They vary in their character and quality.\r\nSome of them are truly great and majestic, while others are of mediocre\r\nmerit. _Opritchnik_, _Mazeppa_, _Tcharodeiki_, and _Jeanne d'Arc_ are\r\ndramatic operas, while _Evgheny Onegin_, _Pique Dame_, and _Yolanta_\r\nare of outspoken lyric type. _Tscherevitschki_ and 'Vakula the Smith'\r\nare his two comic operas.\r\n\r\nThough Tschaikowsky's ambition was to excel in opera, his symphonic\r\ncompositions represent the best he has written, especially his Fourth,\r\nFifth, and Sixth Symphonies, 'The Tempest,' the _Marche Slav_,\r\n'Manfred,' his piano concerto in B-flat minor, and his three ballets,\r\n'Snow Maiden,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' and 'Swan Lake.' He is a perfect\r\nmaster of counterpoint and graceful melodies. How well he mastered his\r\ntechnique is proven by the careful modelling of his themes and figures.\r\nBut in opera his grasp is behind those of his rivals. There is too much\r\nof the West European polish and sentimentality, and too little of the\r\nelemental vigor and grandeur of a Russian dramatist.\r\n\r\nTo the period of Tschaikowsky's last years as a teacher in Moscow,\r\nespecially from 1875 to 1885, belong the mysterious romantic troubles\r\nwhich presumably became the foundation of his creative despair, the\r\npessimism which has made him the Schopenhauer of sound. Here may lie\r\nthe secret of all the turbulent emotionalism from which emanated those\r\ntragic chords, all the wild musical images, that incessant melancholy\r\nstrain which characterize his works. In 1877 he married Antony\r\nIvanovna Millukova, but their married life was of short duration. There\r\nare many strange stories as to his despair on account of an unhappy\r\nlove. Tschaikowsky was an affectionate friend of a Mme. von Meck, with\r\nwhom he was in perpetual correspondence and who gave him material aid\r\nin carrying out his artistic ambitions, though he had never met her.\r\nWhy he did not is a mystery. It is said that he contemplated suicide\r\nupon many occasions. He told his friend Kashkin that twice he had gone\r\nup to his knees in the Moscow River with the idea of drowning himself,\r\nbut that the effect of the cold water sobered him. When his wildest\r\nemotions seized him he would rush out and sit in the snow, if it was\r\nwinter, or stand in the river until numb with the cold. This cured him\r\ntemporarily, but he insisted that he remained a soul-sick man. 'I am\r\nputting all my virtue and wickedness, passion and agony into the piece\r\nI am writing,' he wrote to a friend while composing his _Symphonie\r\nPathétique_.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Tschaikowsky celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his\r\nmusical activity and was honored with the degree of Doctor of Music\r\nby Cambridge University. He made a tour of America, of which he spoke\r\nin high terms as a country of new beauties and new life. One of his\r\nremarks is characteristic. 'The rush and roar of that wild freedom\r\nof America still haunts me. It is like fifty orchestras combined.\r\nAlthough you do not see any Indians running about the streets of New\r\nYork, yet their spirit has put a stamp on its whole life. It is in the\r\neverlasting activity and the stoic attitude toward what we call fate.'\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiar traits of Tschaikowsky was his indifference to\r\nhis creations after they had been produced. He even disliked to hear\r\nthem and always found fault with his early compositions, especially\r\nwith his operas; yet he did not know how he could have improved them.\r\nExceptions, however, were his Fourth and Sixth Symphonies, his 'Eugen\r\nOnegin,' _Sérénade Mélancholique_, his Concerto in D, and a few other\r\ncompositions. While working upon his favorite opera he was also engaged\r\nupon his Fourth Symphony. When 'Eugen Onegin' was first performed in\r\nMoscow, Tschaikowsky whispered to Rubinstein, who was next to him in\r\nthe audience: 'This and the Fourth Symphony are the decisive works of\r\nmy career. If they fail I am a failure.'\r\n\r\nTschaikowsky died suddenly, October 25, 1893, in St. Petersburg--of\r\ncholera, as it was said officially. But according to men who knew him\r\nintimately he poisoned himself. This, we may be sure, is one of the\r\nsecrets sealed by Kashkin.\r\n\r\nTschaikowsky was one of the greatest masters of the orchestra the\r\nworld has seen. In effects of striking brilliance and of sombreness\r\nhe is equally successful, and it is no doubt in a great measure on\r\naccount of this Slavic splendor that his orchestral works have won\r\nthe public. Yet he is far more than a colorist. His mastery over\r\norchestral polyphony is supreme. There is always movement in his music,\r\na rising and falling of all the parts, a complicated interweaving,\r\nnever with the loss of sonority and richness. He is a great harmonist\r\nas well and an irresistible melodist. His rhythms are full of life,\r\nwhether they are march, waltz or barbarous wild dances. The movement\r\nin five-four time in the Sixth Symphony is in itself a masterpiece and\r\nhas stimulated countless efforts in the directions to which it pointed.\r\nIt must be admitted that melody, harmony, and rhythm, all bear the\r\nstamp of the Slavic temperament, and, in so far as they are Slavic or\r\nracial, they are vigorous and healthy; but often Tschaikowsky becomes\r\nmorbidly subjective, is obviously not master of his mood, but slave\r\nto it. Hence, after frequent hearings, there comes a weight upon the\r\nlistener, an intangible oppression which he would be glad to avoid,\r\nbut which cannot be shaken off. One detects the line of the individual\r\nand forgets the splendor of the race.\r\n\r\nYet through Tschaikowsky the glories of Russian music were revealed to\r\nthe general public. He occupies a double position, as a Russian and\r\nas a strange individuality, whose influence has been pronounced upon\r\nmodern music. The Russian composers unquestionably hold a conspicuous\r\nplace among those composers who have been specially gifted to hear\r\nnew possibilities of orchestral sound and to add to the splendor of\r\norchestral music. Many of them denied Wagner. The question of how\r\nfar the peculiar powers of the orchestra have been developed by them\r\nindependently of Wagner, with results in many ways similar, may become\r\nthe source of much speculation. It is quite possible that, thanks\r\nto their own racial sensitiveness, they have devised a brilliant\r\norchestration similar but unrelated to Wagner.\r\n\r\n                                                         I. N.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Established by the Imperial Musical Society in 1862.\r\n\r\n[9] Kashkin: 'Life of Tschaikowsky' (in Russian).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                    THE MUSIC OF MODERN SCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\n    The Rise of national schools in the nineteenth century--Growth\r\n    of national expression in Scandinavian lands--Music in modern\r\n    Denmark--Sweden and her Music--The Norwegian composers; Edvard\r\n    Grieg--Sinding and other Norwegians--The Finnish Renaissance:\r\n    Sibelius and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most striking characteristic of the music of the nineteenth century\r\nhas doubtless been its astonishing enrichment in technical means. Its\r\nnext most striking characteristic is easily its growth in national\r\nexpression. National art-music in the modern sense was almost unknown\r\nbefore the nineteenth century. The nearest thing to it was a 'Turkish\r\nmarch' in a Mozart operetta or sonata, or an 'allemand' or 'schottisch'\r\nin a French suite. The national differences in eighteenth century music\r\nwere differences of school, not of nationality. It is true that Italian\r\nmusic usually tended to lyricism, French to dexterity of form, and\r\nGerman to technical solidity; it is true further that these qualities\r\ncorresponded in a rough way to the characteristics of the respective\r\nnations. But all three used one and the same musical system; they\r\ndiffered not so much in their music as in the way they treated their\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century the national feeling found expression as\r\nit never had before. The causes of this were numerous, but the most\r\nimportant were two of a political nature: First, the spread of the\r\nprinciples of the French Revolution made democracy a far more general\r\nfact than it had ever been before; political authority and moral\r\ninfluence shifted more and more from the rulers to the people and\r\nthe character of the ordinary men and women became more and more\r\nthe character of the nation. Second, the resistance called forth\r\nby Napoleon's wars of aggression aroused national consciousness as\r\nit had never been aroused before. Napoleon, with a solid national\r\nconsciousness behind him, was invincible until he found a national\r\nconsciousness opposed to him--in Spain in 1809, in Russia in 1812, and\r\nin Germany in 1813. Only the sense of nationality had been able to\r\npreserve nations; and it was the sense of nationality that thereafter\r\ncontinued to maintain them.\r\n\r\nTo these two political causes we may perhaps add a third cause--one\r\nof a technical-musical character. With the early Beethoven the old\r\nclassical system of music had reached its apogee. When this was once\r\ncomplete and firmly implanted in people's consciousness contrasting\r\nsorts of music could be clearly apperceived. Once the logical course\r\nof classical development was finished, men's minds were free to look\r\nelsewhere for beauties of another sort. So when a political interest\r\nin the common people led men to investigate the people's folk-songs,\r\nmusical consciousness was at the same time prepared to appreciate the\r\nstriking differences between art-music and folk-music.\r\n\r\nNow all the national music of the nineteenth century is based in a very\r\nreal sense on the folk-music of the people. The music of the eighteenth\r\ncentury could not be truly national, because it was supported chiefly\r\nby the aristocracy, and an art will inevitably tend to express the\r\ncharacter of the people who pay its bills. The differences between the\r\naristocracy of one nation and that of another are largely superficial.\r\nThe court of Louis XV was distinguished from that of Frederick the\r\nGreat chiefly by the cut of the courtiers' clothes. But the France of\r\n1813 was distinguished from the Germany of 1813 by the mould of the\r\nnational soul. And the national soul can be seen very imperfectly in\r\nthe official art of a nation; it must be sought for in the popular\r\nart--in the myths, the fairy tales, the ballads, and the folk-songs. So\r\nwhen the newly awakened national consciousness began to demand musical\r\nexpression, it inevitably sought its materials in the music of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century this popular music was thought too crude to\r\nbe of artistic value. The snobbishness of political life was reflected\r\nin the prevailing attitude toward art. Because the people's melodies\r\nwere different from the accepted music they were held to be wrong. Or\r\nrather, one may say that cultivated people hardly dreamed of their\r\nexistence. Gradually, in the latter half of the eighteenth century,\r\nscholars became aware of the value of popular art. Herder was the first\r\nimportant man to discover it in Germany, and he passed his appreciation\r\nof it on to Goethe. By the opening of the nineteenth century the\r\nappreciation of folk-art was well under way. Collections of folk-songs\r\nand folk-poetry were appearing, and their high artistic value was being\r\nrecognized. With the first decade of the century the impulse reached\r\nthe Scandinavian lands, and their national existence in art began.\r\n\r\nThese countries had of course been free from the immediate turmoil of\r\nthe Napoleonic wars. They had suffered, as all Europe had suffered,\r\nbut they had not been obliged to defend their nationality with their\r\nblood. Denmark and Norway-Sweden had been for centuries substantially\r\nindependent, and Finland, which had been in loose subjugation\r\nalternately to Sweden and Russia, was practically independent for some\r\ntime until a political pact between Napoleon and the Czar Alexander\r\nmade her a grand duchy of Russia; but even as a part of the Russian\r\nEmpire she suffered no violation of her national individuality\r\nuntil late in the nineteenth century. Political independence and\r\ngeographical isolation had left the northern nations somewhat turgid\r\nand provincial. Their artistic life had been largely borrowed. The\r\nvarious courts had their choirs and kapellmeisters, usually imported\r\nfrom Germany. Native composers were infrequent; composition was largely\r\nin the hands of second-rate musicians from Germany who had migrated\r\nthat they might be larger fish in a smaller puddle. And the composition\r\nwas, of course, entirely in the foreign style. Stockholm and Copenhagen\r\nhad their opera in the latter half of the eighteenth century, but\r\nthe works performed were chiefly French and Italian. These imported\r\nworks set the standard for most of the native musical composition.\r\nToward the end of the eighteenth century German influence began to\r\npredominate, especially in Denmark, where the German _Singspiel_ took\r\nroot and enjoyed a long and prosperous career. The German influence\r\nwas much more proper to the Scandinavian lands than that of France\r\nor Italy, but it had not the slightest relation to a national art.\r\nDanish stories occasionally appeared in the subject matter, but the\r\nmusic was substantially that of Reichardt and Zelter in Germany.\r\nIn Sweden the course of events was the same. Occasionally national\r\nsubject matter appeared in operatic librettos, but in the music never.\r\nSweden, which up to the beginning of the nineteenth century continued\r\nto be a force in European political affairs, had naturally enjoyed a\r\nconsiderable degree of intercourse with other nations, and was all\r\nthe more influenced by them in her art. Norway and Finland, however,\r\nwere completely isolated, and received their musical ministrations\r\nnot at second hand but at third. In all these countries there was a\r\nconsiderable degree of musical life (choirs, orchestras, and dramatic\r\nworks), but this was almost wholly confined to the large cities. Yet\r\nall these nations had the possibilities of a rich artistic life--in\r\nnational traditions, in folk-song, and in a common sensitiveness of the\r\nracial soul. All four nations are distinctly musical, and in Denmark\r\nand Finland especially the solo or four-part song was cultivated\r\nlovingly in the home and in the smaller communities.\r\n\r\nFrom their isolation and provincialism the Scandinavian countries were\r\nawakened, not by direct, but by reflex impulse. The vigorous national\r\nlife of other European lands gradually stimulated a sympathetic\r\nmovement in the two Scandinavian peninsulas. Denmark saw its first good\r\ncollection of folk-songs in 1812-14, Sweden in 1814-16. In 1842 came A.\r\nP. Berggreen's famous collection of Danish songs, and about the same\r\ntime the 540 Norse folk-songs and dances gathered and edited by Ludwig\r\nLindeman. Doubtless this interest had some political significance.\r\nBut far more important than these was the appearance in 1835 of the\r\nfirst portion of the _Kalevala_, the Finnish national epic, which has\r\nsince taken its place beside the Iliad and the _Nibelungenlied_ as\r\none of the greatest epics of all time. This remarkable poem seems to\r\nhave been genuinely popular in origin. It remained in the mouths and\r\nhearts of the people throughout the centuries, almost unknown to the\r\nscholars. A Finnish physician, Elias Lönnrot, made it his life work to\r\ncollect and piece together the fragments of the great poem. In 1835\r\nhe published thirty-five runes, and in 1849 a new edition containing\r\nfifty--all taken down directly from the peasants' lips. This work had\r\na decided political significance. It intensified and solidified the\r\nnational consciousness, tending to counterbalance the influence of the\r\nSwedish language, which until then had been unquestionedly that of the\r\ncultivated classes; later it formed a buffer to the Russian language\r\nwhich the Czar attempted to force upon the Finns by imperial edict. It\r\nserved to arouse the national feeling to such a pitch that Finland has\r\nin recent years been the chief thorn in the Czar's side. And this fact,\r\nas we shall see, helped to give the Finnish music of the last three\r\ndecades its intense national character.\r\n\r\nThe distinctly national movement in Scandinavian countries began, as we\r\nhave said, in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Its growth\r\nthereafter was steady and uninterrupted and was aided by the generous\r\nspread of choral and symphonic music. In the first stage the music\r\nwritten was based chiefly on German models, but it was written more\r\nand more by native Scandinavians. In the second stage (roughly the\r\nsecond third of the century) the native composers wrote music that was\r\nbased on the national folk-music, but timidly and vaguely. In the third\r\nstage, the folk-tunes were frankly utilized, the national scales and\r\nrhythms were deliberately and continuously called into service, and the\r\nwhole musical output given a character homogeneously and distinctively\r\nnational. It was in this stage that the Scandinavian music became\r\nknown to the world at large. Grieg, a man of the highest talent,\r\npossibly of genius, made himself one of the best loved composers of the\r\nnineteenth century, and awakened a widespread taste for the exotic.\r\nTogether with Tschaikowsky the Russian he made nationalism in music a\r\nworld-wide triumph. After his success it was no longer counted against\r\na composer that he spoke in a strange tongue. The very strangeness\r\nof the tongue became a source of interest; and if there was added\r\nthereto a strong and beautiful musical message the new composer usually\r\nhad easy sailing. The outward success of Grieg doubtless stimulated\r\nmusical endeavor in Scandinavian lands, and enabled the world at large\r\nto become familiar with many minor talents whose reputations could\r\notherwise not have passed beyond their national borders. Finally,\r\nthere has arisen in Finland the greatest and most individual of all\r\nScandinavian composers, and one of the most powerful writers of music\r\nin the modern world--Jean Sibelius. In him the most intense nationalism\r\nspeaks with a universal voice.\r\n\r\nThe folk-music which made this Scandinavian nationalism possible is\r\nrich and extensive. Apparently it is of rather recent growth, but this\r\nfact is offset by the isolation of the countries in which it developed.\r\nIt is of pure Germanic stock (with the exception of certain Eastern\r\ninfluences in the music of Finland). Yet it has a marked individuality,\r\na perfume of its own. This is the more remarkable as we discover\r\nthat in external qualities it exhibits only slight differences from\r\nthe German folk-song. The individuality is not obvious, as with the\r\nRussian or Hungarian folk-music, but subtly resident in a multitude\r\nof details which escape analysis. Not only is the Scandinavian music\r\nclearly distinct from that of the other Germanic lands, but the music\r\nof each of the four countries is subtly distinguished from that of all\r\nthe others. The Danish is most like the ordinary German folk-song with\r\nwhich we are familiar. It is not rich in extent or variety of mood. Its\r\nchief qualities are a discreet playfulness and a gentle melancholy. In\r\nformal structure it is good but not distinguished. It is predominantly\r\nvocal; in old and characteristic dances Denmark is lacking. The\r\nSwedish folk-music is in every way richer. It does not attain to the\r\nextremes of animal and spiritual expression, like the Russian, but\r\nwithin its fairly broad limits it can show every variety of feeling.\r\nEven in its liveliest moments it reveals something of the predominant\r\nnorthern melancholy, but the dances, which are numerous and spirited,\r\nreveal a buoyant health. The thin veil of melancholy which has been\r\nso often noticed is not nearly so prominent as a certain refined\r\nsensuality. Sweden, more than any of the other Scandinavian lands, has\r\nknown periods of cosmopolitan luxury. She has become a citizen of the\r\nworld, with something of the man-of-the-world's self-indulgence and\r\nself-consciousness. So her folk-songs frequently reveal an exquisite\r\nsense of form which seems French rather than Germanic.\r\n\r\nThe Norse folk-song naturally shows a close relationship with that\r\nof Sweden, but in every point of difference it tends straight away\r\nfrom the German. Norway has for centuries been a primitive country in\r\nits material conditions; a country of tiny villages, of valleys for\r\nmonths isolated one from the other; a country of pioneer virtues and\r\nindividualistic values. Large cities are few; the ordinary machinery\r\nof civilization is even yet limited. The economic activities are still\r\nin great measure primitive, and much of the work is out of doors, as\r\nin shipping, fishing and pasturing. The scenery is among the grandest\r\nin the world. So it is not surprising that the Norwegian folk-music is\r\nvigorous and sometimes a little crude, and that it reveals an intense\r\nfeeling for nature. The people are deeply religious and filled with\r\nthe stern Protestant sense of a personal relation with God. The tender\r\nand mystic aspects of the music are less easy to account for; many of\r\nthe songs are an intimate revelation of subtle mood, and others show\r\na tonal vagueness which in modern times is called 'impressionistic.'\r\nMore than the Swedish songs they are spontaneous and poetic. If they\r\nreflect nature it is in her personal aspect. They show not so much the\r\nNorwegian mountains as the fog which covers the mountains. They sing\r\nnot so much the old Vikings as the quiet people who have settled down\r\nto fishing and trading when their wanderings are over. They reveal not\r\nthe face of nature, but her bosom on which lonely men may rest.\r\n\r\nThe Finnish music is of a mixed stock. Primarily it is an adaptation\r\nof the Swedish, and the greater number of Finnish songs are externally\r\nof Swedish mould. But Lapland has also contributed her child-like\r\nmelodies. The true Finnish music, however, is that drawn from the\r\nlegendary sources of the original race. The melodies of the old runes\r\nretain their primitive aspects, and are unlike those of any other\r\nnation. They are doubtless the very melodies to which the _Kalevala_\r\nwas originally sung. Externally monotonous and heavy, they reveal\r\nstrange beauties on closer examination. They are distinguished by many\r\nrepetitions of the same note, by irregular or ill-defined metre, and by\r\na long and sinuous melodic line. Another typical sort of melody is the\r\n'horn-call,' developed from the original blasts of the hunting-horn.\r\nThe theme of the trio of the scherzo of Sibelius' second symphony\r\nis typical of the rune melody. Finally the Russian influence may be\r\nfelt in many of the older Finnish tunes--in uncertain tonality and a\r\npeculiar use of the minor. This mixture of musical forces is indicative\r\nof the ethnological and social mixture which is the Finnish race. The\r\nFinns are primarily a Mongolian people. From the Laplanders to the\r\nnorth they received what that simple people had to give. For centuries\r\nthey were under the domination of Sweden; Swedish was the language\r\nof their literature and their cultured conversation, and Swedish was\r\ntheir official civilization. A considerable accession of Swedish\r\nimmigrants and infusion of Swedish blood left their affairs in the\r\ncontrol of Germanic influences. (It is on this account that the Finnish\r\nis included in a chapter on Scandinavian music.) Finally, a nearness\r\nto Russia and an intermittent subjugation to the Czardom brought into\r\ntheir midst Russian influences which were assimilated flexibly but\r\nincompletely. In the late nineteenth century Finland experienced a\r\nrenaissance of national feeling. The genuine Finnish language gained\r\nthe uppermost, and provided a rallying point for the resistance to\r\nthe Czar's attempted Russianization of his duchy. Finnish traditions\r\ndisplaced those of the Vikings. And Finland began to stand forth as\r\nan oriental nation with a heroic background. Therefore, though her\r\nmusic developed largely out of Germanic materials, it has become, under\r\nSibelius (himself of Teutonic blood), a thing apart.\r\n\r\nThe use of folk-music on the part of the Scandinavian composers seems\r\nto have been less deliberate and conscious than in the case of the\r\n'neo-Russian' nationalists.[10] In the earliest composers who can be\r\nregarded as national it is scarcely to be noticed. For some years after\r\nDanish music began to have a national character the actual presence\r\nof folk-elements was to be detected only on close examination. Such\r\na careful writer as Mr. Finck indignantly denies that Grieg made\r\nany deliberate use of folk-music. In his view the melodies of the\r\npeople are so inferior to those of Grieg that to suggest the latter's\r\nindebtedness is something in the nature of blasphemy. Nevertheless, in\r\nthe process of nationalizing the northern music the patriotic composers\r\nintroduced the spirit and the technical materials of the folk-music\r\ninto conscious works of art. Just what the process was is hardly to\r\nbe known, even by the composers themselves. We know that Grieg was an\r\nardent nationalist and studied and admired the folk-songs. To what\r\nextent he imitated or borrowed folk-melodies for his compositions is\r\nnot of first importance. Probably, with the best of the nationalists,\r\nthe process was one of saturating themselves in the music of their\r\nnative land and then composing personally, and from the heart. At all\r\nevents, it is certain that the influence of any folk-music, deeply\r\nstudied, is too pervasive for a sensitive composer to escape.\r\n\r\nSince the first third of the nineteenth century the Scandinavian\r\ncomposers have been heavily influenced by the prevailing German musical\r\nforces. German musicians were frequent visitors or sojourners in\r\nScandinavian cities, and the musicians of the northern lands sought\r\ntheir education almost exclusively in Germany. Hence Scandinavian music\r\nhas reflected closely the changes of fashion that prevailed to the\r\nsouth. Mendelssohn and Schumann (through the work of Gade) were the\r\nfirst dominating influences. Chopin influenced their style of pianistic\r\nwriting, and Wagner and Liszt in due time influenced their harmonic\r\nprocedure. Music dramas were written quite in the Wagnerian style, and\r\na minor impulse toward programme music came from Berlioz and Liszt.\r\nIn the art of instrumentation Wagner and Strauss received instant\r\nrecognition and imitation--an imitation which soon became a schooling\r\nand developed into a pronounced native art. Even Brahms had his share\r\nin the work, primarily in the shorter piano pieces which have been so\r\ndistinctive a part of the Scandinavian musical output, and latterly in\r\nthe 'absolute' polyphonic work of Alfvén, Stenhammar and Norman.\r\n\r\nBut though all these strands are distinctly discernible, that which\r\ngives the Scandinavian tonal art a right to a separate existence is a\r\ncontribution of its own. In the larger and more ambitious forms the\r\nScandinavian composers have usually not been at their best or most\r\ndistinctive. It is the smaller forms--songs, piano pieces, orchestral\r\npictures, etc.--which have carried the music of the Northland\r\nthroughout Europe and America. In these we best see the distinguishing\r\nScandinavian traits. First there is an impressionism, a dexterity in\r\nthe creation of specific mood or atmosphere, which preceded the recent\r\ncraze for these qualities. The music of Grieg, simple as it seems to\r\nus now, was in its time a sort of gospel of what could be done with\r\nmusic on the intimate or pictorial sides. Vagueness, mystery, poetry\r\nspoke to us out of this music of the north. Next there was a feeling\r\nfor nature, for pictorial values, for delineative music in its more\r\nromantic terms, which had not been found in the more strenuous program\r\nmusic of the Germans. The 'Sunrise' of Grieg's 'Peer Gynt Suite'\r\nattuned many thousands of ears to the beauty of natural scenery as\r\ndepicted in music. Finally there was a feeling for tonal qualities\r\nas such, which the modern French school has developed to an almost\r\nunbelievable extent. The tone of the piano became an intimate part\r\nof the poetry of northern piano pieces. Further, the school of Grieg\r\nhas shown an astonishing talent in the handling of orchestral color.\r\nBrilliant and poetic instrumentation has been one of the chief glories\r\nof the northern school. It was the romantic impulse that was behind\r\nall the best work, and accordingly the formal element does not bulk\r\nlarge in Scandinavian music. But there is often a wonderful finesse,\r\npolish and dexterity which reveals an exquisite sense of structure and\r\nworkmanship, especially in the smaller forms. Vocal music, especially\r\nbefore the opening of the twentieth century, flourished, and the songs\r\nof certain northern composers have taken their place beside the best\r\nbeloved lyric works of Germany. Finally, there are brilliant exceptions\r\nto the statement that the best northern work has been achieved in the\r\nsmaller forms; the concertos of Grieg, the symphonic pieces of Sinding,\r\nand the symphonies and tone-poems of Sibelius, strike an epic note in\r\nmodern music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThe early history of Danish music is that of any royal court of\r\npost-Renaissance times. Foreign composers and performers were invited\r\nto the capital, and when the lower classes had been unusually well\r\ndrained of their earnings history recorded a 'brilliant musical age.'\r\nIn the eighteenth century there was a royal opera, performing French\r\nand Italian pieces. From time to time various choral or instrumental\r\nsocieties were founded. In the conventional sense the musical life\r\nof Copenhagen was flourishing. But in all this there was no trace of\r\nnational Danish music.\r\n\r\nThe first composer who may be called truly national began working\r\nafter a thorough Germanizing of the country's musical taste had taken\r\nplace. This man was Johann Peter Emilius Hartmann (1805-1900). His\r\nextensive work was hardly known outside the limits of his native\r\nland. The few examples which were played in Germany were speedily\r\nforgotten. But he gradually came to be recognized as the great national\r\ncomposer of Denmark. Though a large part of his student years was\r\nspent in his native land, he was at first under the influence of\r\nthe fashionable composers of the time, such as Marschner, Spontini,\r\nSpohr and Auber. But, though not a student of Danish folk-songs, he\r\ngradually came to feel the individuality of the national music, and\r\nin 1832 made himself a national spokesman with his _melodrame_ 'The\r\nGolden Horns,' to Oehlenschlager's text. His opera, 'Little Christine,'\r\nto Andersen's story, performed in 1846, was thoroughly national and\r\npopular in spirit. His output was astonishingly large and varied.\r\nHe wrote for nearly every established form, symphonies, overtures,\r\nsongs, choral pieces, religious and secular, sonatas as well as short\r\nromantic pieces for the piano, works for organ and violin, ballets,\r\nand picturesque orchestral poems. His nationalism does not appear\r\nconsistently in his work; he seems to have made it no creed; perhaps\r\nhe only imitated it from Weber and Chopin. But when he chose to work\r\nwith national materials he came nearer to the popular spirit than any\r\nother composer of the time, barring the two or three great ones of\r\nwhom Weber is the type. His facility was great, his themes pregnant\r\nand arresting. He revealed an energetic structural power, and together\r\nwith fine polyphonic ability a mastery of romantic suggestion in the\r\nstyle of Mendelssohn. But it is chiefly by his native feeling for\r\nthe folk-style that he established himself as the first Scandinavian\r\nnationalist in music. Grieg wrote of him: 'The dreams of our younger\r\ngeneration of northern men were his from the time he reached maturity.\r\nThe best and deepest thoughts which moved a later generation of more or\r\nless important spirits were spoken first in him, and found their first\r\necho in us.'\r\n\r\nBut it was Niels W. Gade (1817-1890) who represented the Danish\r\nschool in the eyes of the outside world. This was due chiefly to his\r\nstrategic position as friend of Mendelssohn and, after Mendelssohn's\r\ndeath, director of the Gewandhaus orchestra in Leipzig. At bottom\r\nhe was thoroughly a German of the conservative romantic school. His\r\nexcellence in the eyes of the time consisted in his ability at writing\r\nMendelssohn's style of music with almost Mendelssohn's charm and\r\nfinish. But he was also the Dane, and in subtle wise he managed to\r\nimpregnate his music with Danish musical feeling. His eight symphonies\r\nhad a high standing in his day, the first and last being typically\r\nnational in character, serving, in fact, as a sort of propaganda for\r\nthe national school that was to come. But Gade was more thoroughly\r\nnational in some of his choral ballads and dramatic cantatas, such as\r\n'Calamus,' 'The Erlking's Daughter,' 'The Stream,' and others; and\r\nespecially in his orchestral suite, 'A Summer Day in the Country,' and\r\nhis suite for string orchestra, _Holbergiana_. His personality was not\r\nso vigorous as that of Hartmann; his culture was more conservative and\r\nclassical; the shadow of Mendelssohn prevented the more aggressive\r\nnational utterance that might have been desired. But what he did he did\r\nwell, and his immense influence on the future of Scandinavian music was\r\nestablished through his masterful fusing of the best German classic\r\nmanner of the time with popular national materials.\r\n\r\nAmong the Danish composers of the same time we may mention Emil\r\nHartmann (1836-1898), son of the great Hartmann, prolific composer of\r\norchestral pieces, chamber music, and operas of professedly national\r\ncharacter; Peter A. Heise (1830-1870), composer of songs to some of the\r\nbest national lyric poetry of the time; and August Winding (1835-1899),\r\ncomposer of piano, orchestral and chamber music in which national color\r\nand folk humor were discreetly brought to the foreground.\r\n\r\nIn recent times the Danish school, of the four Scandinavian branches,\r\nhas been least national in intent. Foreign gods have exercised their\r\nsway in one fashion or another. Nor can we say that the absolute value\r\nof the more recent works is distinguished. Among the half dozen Danish\r\ncomposers who have attained to eminence there is none who can be\r\nconsidered the equal of either Gade or Hartmann in personal ability.\r\nMuch of the best efforts of the younger men has gone to larger forms,\r\nin which either their creative inspiration or their formal mastery\r\nhas proved insufficient. Among them there are four of marked ability:\r\nAugust Enna, in opera; Asger Hamerik, in symphonic music; P. E.\r\nLange-Müller, in lyric and piano works; and Carl Nielsen, in chamber\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAugust Enna (born 1860) is the most prolific and successful of\r\nDenmark's opera composers. Chiefly self-taught, but mainly German in\r\nhis influences, he has written some ten operas in which one influence\r\nor style after another is evident. 'Cleopatra,' after Rider Haggard's\r\nstory, is ambitious and theatric, but it reveals, alongside of\r\nfrank Wagnerism, the ghost of Meyerbeer and of Italian opera of the\r\n'transition period' of the 'eighties. 'Aucassin and Nicolette' attempts\r\nthe quaint and naïve style which is supposed to comport with the late\r\nMiddle Ages; it has a distinction of its own, but too often it is mere\r\nconventional romantic opera. The fairy operas after Andersen--'The\r\nLittle Match Girl' and 'The Princess of the Peapod'--are in more\r\ncongenial style, but lack the necessary consistent manner of light\r\nfantasy. The truth is that Enna, with marked abilities, is limited to\r\nthe expression of tender sentiment, gentle melancholy, and personal,\r\nintimate moods. His invention is happy, though uneven; his use of\r\nthe orchestra colorful but not always in taste. He lacks the ability\r\nto conceive and carry out a large work in a consistent and elevated\r\nmanner. He fails in that ultimate test of the thorough workman--the\r\nability to execute a whole work in a consistent and homogeneous style.\r\nThe trouble is not with his operatic instinct, which is sufficiently\r\nvivid; nor with his melodic invention as such, for this is often fresh\r\nand charming. But his musicianship and his inspiration have not proven\r\nequal to the task he has set himself.\r\n\r\nAsger Hamerik (born 1843) has undertaken an equally big task in the\r\nfield of symphonic music. He plans on a large scale, but it can hardly\r\nbe said that he thinks likewise. We may note a 'Poetic' symphony, a\r\n'Tragic' symphony, a 'Lyric' symphony, a 'Majestic' symphony, and a\r\nchoral symphony, among several others. Of his two operas, one, 'The\r\nVendetta,' received a performance in Milan. There is considerable\r\nchoral and chamber music, and in particular a 'Northern' orchestral\r\nsuite by which his artistic personality may be best known. But he has\r\nat bottom little of the national feeling. He is facilely eclectic,\r\nbut with no individual or consistent binding principle. He has a\r\nromanticism that recalls Dvořák's--graceful, mildly sensuous, pleasing\r\nrather than inspiring; he has further a marked gift as an instrumental\r\ncolorist. But his harmony is conventional, and his thematic ideas\r\nare usually undistinguished. Finally, his structural power is not\r\nsufficient to raise his musical material to a high artistic plane.\r\nHamerik is out of the main line of Scandinavian national music, but\r\nhas not been able to make a place for himself in music universal.\r\n\r\nMuch more to the purpose in intent and achievement is P. E.\r\nLange-Müller (born 1850). He reveals a graceful sense of form and a\r\nsincere emotional feeling in his smaller works for piano and voice.\r\nHis harmony is conservative and sometimes disappointing; but whenever\r\nhe strikes the tender mood of folk-music he saves himself with a touch\r\nof poetry. But he is rather a follower of the old school of German\r\nromanticism than of Scandinavian nationalism. The four-act opera, _Frau\r\nJeanna_, is content with an unobtrusive lyric style, but the lyricism\r\nis not exalted enough to sustain such a large-scale work. The melodrama\r\n_Middelalderlig_, of more recent date, shows much poetic color but a\r\nfundamental lack of invention. In the larger works he is at his best\r\nin the fairy-comedy, 'Once upon a Time.' His symphony 'In Autumn,' his\r\norchestral suite, 'Alhambra,' and 'Niels Ebbesen' for chorus, have met\r\nwith indifferent success. Lange-Müller is primarily a lyric composer\r\nfor voice and piano, and in this field he shows a sort of grace and\r\ntenderness which we shall meet with frequently in recent Swedish music.\r\n\r\nA sincere and able, yet austere, composer is Carl Nielsen (born 1865).\r\nHis music is, with that of the Swede Alfvén, less programmistic and\r\nmore 'absolute' than we shall meet with in any other distinguished\r\nScandinavian musician of modern times. The national element in his work\r\nis almost _nil_. A master of counterpoint, and a vigorous innovator in\r\nthe modern Russian style, he commands respect rather than love. His\r\noutput includes more than half a dozen symphonies, a number of works\r\nfor string quartet and violin, some large compositions for chorus and\r\norchestra, and a four-act opera, 'Saul and David.' It is by this that\r\nhe is best known. This is a work to command respectful attention from\r\nmusicians, but hardly enthusiastic applause from ordinary audiences.\r\nThe writing shows great musical knowledge, careful and ample ability in\r\ncounterpoint and in modulation of the complex modern sort, a certain\r\nunity of style, and a command of special emotional color. But the work\r\nis perhaps rather that of the symphonist than of the operatic poet. His\r\ninstrumentation, unlike his harmony, is conservative. His workmanship\r\nis thorough, and his musicianship wide and soundly based.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor names there are several who deserve mention for one\r\nreason or another. Ludolf Nielsen (born 1876) is a thorough classicist\r\nat heart, though he has become known in Germany through his symphonic\r\npoems 'In Memoriam,' _Fra Bjaergene_, and 'Summer Night Moods.' He\r\nis more than usually talented, but very conservative in his style.\r\nHis themes are interesting though not striking, and his product is\r\nsufficiently inspired with human feeling to be preserved from pedantry.\r\nHakon Börresen (born 1876) has distinguished himself with many songs\r\nwhich preserve the national tradition established for Norway by Grieg\r\nand Sinding. His chamber music has revealed harmonic invention and\r\ntender coloring which show him to be one of the chosen of the younger\r\nDanish composers. Finally, we may mention Otto Malling (born 1848), an\r\nable writer for organ and string quartet; Victor Bendix (born 1851),\r\nwell known in Denmark for a number of symphonies which combine delicate\r\npoetry with structural beauty; Ludvig Schytte (born 1848), prolific\r\nwriter of piano pieces, and Cornelius Rübner, who commands respect for\r\nsolidly classic workmanship. These latter men are of the old school. Of\r\nthe younger generation in Denmark we are hardly justified in hoping for\r\nworks of great distinction, unless a possible exception may be made in\r\nthe case of Börresen. For, speaking broadly, the national impulse has\r\ndeparted from Danish composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nThough Scandinavian art was first brought to the attention of the\r\nworld at large through the Norwegians (Grieg in music and Ibsen\r\nin literature), Sweden has in more recent years held her share of\r\ninternational attention. After Ibsen the Swede Strindberg was perhaps\r\nthe most talked-of dramatist in Europe. Still more recently the novels\r\nof Selma Lagerlöf and the sociological writings of Ellen Key have been\r\nwidely translated and read, not only in European lands, but in America\r\nalso. Strindberg was a supreme artist, a personality of an intensity\r\nequalling Nietzsche and of a spiritual variety suggesting that of\r\nGoethe. The strain of violent morbidity in his _Weltanschauung_ was a\r\npurely personal and not at all a national matter. As executive artist\r\nhe showed an almost classic balance and control. Selma Lagerlöf is\r\nsane and finely poised, and Ellen Key has by her moderation and her\r\nclearness of intellectual vision made herself a leader in a department\r\nof modern sociological study which more than any other is apt to be\r\ntreated sentimentally and hysterically. Poise and artistic control are,\r\nin fact, to be noticed generally in modern Swedish art, and especially\r\nin music. The cosmopolitan character of Swedish political history is\r\nhere seen in its results. Someone has called Stockholm 'the Paris of\r\nthe north.' The epithet is just: grace, conscious artistry, sensuous\r\nself-indulgence, are to be found in Swedish music in a degree that\r\ncontrasts markedly with the militant self-expression of the Norwegian\r\nschool. Without losing its national qualities the art of modern Sweden\r\nhas spoken the easy language of the European capitals.\r\n\r\nSweden's story is like Denmark's: first a thorough Germanization of\r\nher music, then a gradual growth of the national tone. This tone\r\ngrew in every case out of the early German romanticism. The first\r\ngreat Swedish composer and the earliest romanticist was Franz Berwald\r\n(1796-1868). His position in Sweden is somewhat analogous to that held\r\nin Denmark by Hartmann. His output was large, and in the largest forms.\r\nHe undertook symphonic works which until his time had been neglected\r\nin his native land. Without being known much outside Sweden he gained\r\na place in the hearts of his countrymen which he has held ever since.\r\nHis most popular work was his _Symphonie Sérieuse_ in G minor, composed\r\nin 1843, sincere, poetic and musicianly. The influence of Schumann is\r\npredominant. A considerable quantity of symphonic and chamber music,\r\nreflecting chiefly Beethoven and Mendelssohn, gained him a position as\r\nthe foremost symphonic writer of his time. An early violin concerto,\r\ncomposed in 1820, reveals him as a sincere student of Beethoven,\r\nyouthful, romantic and progressive. Out of half a dozen operas we may\r\nmention _Estrella de Soria_, a romantic work of large proportions,\r\nbuilt on the Parisian model (though showing the homely influence of\r\nWeber)--with hunting chorus, grand ballet, and all. That he was not\r\nunconscious of his nationality is proved by the names of some of\r\nhis choral compositions, such as _Gustav Adolph bei Lützen_, 'The\r\nVictory of Karl XII at Narwa,' and the _Nordische Phantasiebilder_. A\r\n'symphonic poem,' _En landtlig Bröllopfest_, makes extensive use of\r\nSwedish melodies, but the style is not a national one, and the themes\r\nare merely utilized without being developed. As a highly trained and\r\nspontaneous worker in the early romantic style Berwald performed a\r\ngreat service in awakening musical consciousness in his native land.\r\nBut here ends his national significance.\r\n\r\nBerwald's tendency was represented in the following generation by\r\nAlbert Rubenson (1826-1901), a less talented but very able composer.\r\nHe came from the Leipzig school and was thoroughly Germanized, but\r\nlike Berwald devoted some attention to Swedish subjects. Ludwig\r\nNormann (1831-1885) anticipated the modern Swedish composers in his\r\npreference for the smaller forms. In his piano music he is tender and\r\nidyllic, delighting in detail and suggestive device, something of a\r\npoet and tone-painter. Mendelssohn is the chief influence in his piano\r\nwork. Though this is thin in style, it is rich in charming melody and\r\nis carried out with a fine polish. In his larger works, such as the\r\nsymphony in E-flat major (1840), he is still the melodist; his writing\r\nis fresh and even original, but his scoring is without distinction.\r\nHis romantic overtures are in the Mendelssohnian manner, with romantic\r\ncolor in the fashion of the time.\r\n\r\nOne of the most talented of the early Swedish composers was Ivan\r\nHallström (1826-1901), who may be said to have been the first\r\ntruly national composer of his land. He appreciated the artistic\r\npossibilities of the national folk-song and made its use in his music\r\na chief tenet in his artistic creed. This was preëminently true in\r\nhis operas--such as _Den Bergtagna_, _Die Gnomenbraut_, _Der Viking_,\r\nand _Neaga_. The last-named is a romantic work teeming with color and\r\npoetry, with traces of Wagnerian influence, but with much vigor, beauty\r\nand depth. Some of these works have been favorably received in Germany,\r\nbut they are not sufficiently personal and dramatic to justify a long\r\nlife. The Swedish folk-song was carried into symphonic and chamber\r\nmusic by J. Adolph Hägg (born 1850), a disciple of Gade and an able and\r\nfruitful composer of symphonies and sonatas, and romantic pieces for\r\npiano, which are filled with romantic and local color.\r\n\r\nBut the early musical generation, of which Hallström may be considered\r\none of the last, was more distinctive and national in its songs than\r\nin its instrumental works. The first half of the nineteenth century\r\nmay be called the golden age of the Swedish _Lied_. It was a time of\r\nchoral societies, some of which became famous throughout the continent.\r\nOtto Lindblad (1809-1864) was a leader and prolific composer for such\r\nsocieties. It is to his credit to have composed the official national\r\nsong of Sweden. But the great lyric genius of Sweden was Adolph Fr.\r\nLindblad (1801-1879), who is commonly called 'the Swedish Schubert.'\r\nHis genius was tender and elegiac, responding sensitively to the colors\r\nof nature, and, thanks to the art of Jenny Lind, it became familiar to\r\nconcert-goers in many lands.\r\n\r\nSwedish music of modern times has maintained a wide variety of forms\r\nand styles. The national feeling is still strong, though some of\r\nthe ablest work is being done in an 'absolute' idiom. On the whole\r\nthe recent Swedish school is best represented to the outside world\r\nby Petersen-Berger with his short and graceful piano pieces, and by\r\nSjögren with his songs. In opera Sweden has approached an international\r\nstanding, but has not quite attained it. Her opera is represented at\r\nits best by Andreas Hallén (born 1846), who used national tone-material\r\nwith Wagnerian technique. Like most other northern musicians of his\r\ntime he went to Leipzig for his training and sought in Germany for\r\nhis beacon lights. After returning to his native land he became\r\nindispensable in its musical life, serving as director of the Stockholm\r\nPhilharmonic Society and of the Stockholm opera. Besides songs and\r\nchoral works he wrote a number of symphonic pieces of a high order,\r\nfilled with Swedish melody and Swedish color. The Swedish Rhapsodies\r\nopus 23, based entirely upon well-known national songs, are of a\r\nsolid technique and agreeable variety; the themes themselves are\r\nlittle developed, but by their scoring and their juxtaposition they\r\nbecome fused into an admirable whole. The _Sommersaga_, opus 36,\r\nlacks specific Swedish color, but is an attractive and able work in\r\nthe older romantic style. The _Toteninsel_, opus 45, is an ambitious\r\nsymphonic poem. The themes are arresting, the development powerful,\r\nand the harmony energetic, but the work lacks the dithyrambic quality\r\ndemanded of tone-poems in recent times, and hence seems outmoded. In\r\n'The Music of the Spheres,' dating from 1909, we discover an admirable\r\nadaptation and fusion of modern harmonic technique, but the ideas and\r\nthe construction speak of a bygone age. In all these works Hallén\r\nwas mainly under the influence of Liszt. In the operas, on which his\r\nreputation chiefly rests, he was at first wholly Wagnerian. His first\r\nwork for the stage, 'Harald the Viking,' though presumably Swedish, is\r\nutterly Wagnerian in treatment. Were it not that Wagnerian imitation\r\ncannot be truly creative, this work would surely take a high rank,\r\nfor it is powerful, dramatic, and admirably scored. The national\r\ntone becomes more marked in the later operas--_Hexfällen_ (1896),\r\n_Waldemarskatten_ (1899) and _Waldborgsmässa_ (1901). The Wagnerian\r\nleit-motif and Wagnerian harmony are still present, but the Swedish\r\nmaterial has suitably modified the general style. In _Waldemarskatten_,\r\nwhich is of a light romantic tone, one even feels that the composer\r\nhas despaired of being successful in the highest musical forms and\r\nhas made a compromise in the direction of easy popularity. But the\r\nwork is filled with beautiful passages. In the spots where Hallén\r\nimitates folk-song or folk-dance, he is fresh and inspiring. His\r\nmusical treatment is never highly personal; on the other hand he shows\r\nmost valuable qualities--vigor, passion, folk-feeling, and above all\r\ndramatic sense. His scoring, too, is rich and colorful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best known and most typical of the modern Swedes is Emil\r\nSjögren (born 1853), the undisputed master of the modern Swedish\r\nart-song. No other composer of his land is so individual as he. No\r\nother is more specifically Swedish, in perfumed grace and sensuous\r\ntenderness. Yet he is by no means a salon composer. His work is\r\nenergetic, showing at times even a touch of the noble and heroic. His\r\nnationalism does not consist so much in his use of actual Swedish\r\nmaterial as in his finely racial manner of treatment. In his short\r\npiano pieces--cycles, novelettes, landscape pictures, etc.--he has\r\nimpregnated the salon manner of a Mendelssohn with something of the\r\ncolor and personal feeling of a Grieg. His choral works are highly\r\nprized in Sweden. His work in the classical forms, chiefly for violin\r\nand piano, are conservative in form and (until recently) in harmony.\r\nBut it is in his songs that Sjögren has expressed himself most\r\nperfectly. These are very numerous and show a wide range of emotional\r\nexpression. Beyond a doubt they are thoroughly successful only in\r\nthe tenderer and intimate moods. They reveal a psychological power\r\nrecalling that of Schumann, and an impressionistic harmonic perfume\r\nsimilar to that in Grieg's best work. In the brief strophe form Sjögren\r\nshows himself master of the exquisite form which distinguishes the\r\nSwedish folk-song. In his early period his accompaniment followed\r\nclosely the regular voice-part, and his harmony, while always\r\npersonal, was simple. A middle period shows a perfect blending of\r\nvoice and piano, with freedom and variety in each, much pianistic\r\nresourcefulness, and a remarkable melodic gift. Since this period his\r\nharmony has undergone a striking change. He has evidently sat at the\r\nfeet of the modern French masters, and has adopted an idiom which is\r\ncomplex and difficult. He has managed to keep it original and personal,\r\nbut it is to be doubted whether the recent songs will ever hold a\r\npermanent place beside the lovely ones of the middle period.\r\n\r\nOf almost equal personal distinction and importance is Wilhelm\r\nPetersen-Berger (born 1867), a master of romantic piano music in the\r\nsmaller forms, and a national voice to his native land. His work is\r\nvaried. There is chamber music such as the E minor violin sonata. There\r\nis a 'Banner Symphony' (1904) and one entitled _Sonnenfärd_ (1910).\r\nThere are male choruses, such as _En Fjällfärd_, and orchestral works\r\nsuch as the 'May Carnival in Stockholm,' together with at least four\r\noperas--_Sveagaldrar_ (1897), _Das Glück_ (1902), _Ran_ (1903) and\r\n_Arnljot_ (1907). Finally there are the piano pieces, a rich and varied\r\nlist ranging all the way from the simplest of 'parlor melodies' to\r\nlarge tone poems and concert works. Some of the piano pieces bear such\r\ntitles as 'To the Roses,' 'Summer Song,' and 'Lawn Tennis.' Others are\r\nambitiously named 'Northern Rhapsody' (with orchestra) and 'Swedish\r\nSummer.' With some of these works Petersen-Berger takes a place\r\nbeside the ablest and most poetic modern writers for the pianoforte.\r\nLandscape, story and mood are here expressed, with a technique ranging\r\nfrom that of Schumann's 'Children's Pieces' all the way to the modern\r\nidiom of Ravel. If some of the pieces seem cheap and sentimental let\r\nit be remembered that they are replacing much less attractive things\r\nwritten by third rate men, and are helping to raise the taste of the\r\n'ordinary music-lover' as Mendelssohn's 'Songs without Words' did half\r\na century before. His melody is truly lyric and his harmony truly\r\nimpressionistic. His genius for the piano is proved by his ability to\r\nget full and colorful effects out of a style of writing which on paper\r\nlooks thin. Though sentimentality abounds, the spirit is fundamentally\r\nvigorous and healthy and at times approaches something like tragic\r\ndignity. The 'Northern Rhapsody' is a wholly admirable treatment of\r\nfolk-tunes on a large scale and with the idiom of pianistic virtuosity.\r\nThe songs are often charming, though on the whole less satisfactory\r\nthan the piano pieces. When he writes simply he shows almost flawless\r\ntaste and artistic selection. When he aims at the mood of high\r\ntragedy, as in the songs from Nietzsche, he is sometimes unexpectedly\r\nsuccessful. The Nietzsche songs, radical in technique, are moving and\r\nimpressive. In his large works Petersen-Berger is not so successful.\r\nHis _Sonnenfärd_ symphony is lyric, rather than orchestral. It is\r\nlacking in structural power, and in the broad spiritual sweep which\r\nsuch a large-scale work must have. But here again his charming melody\r\nalmost saves the day. The opera _Arnljot_ can hardly be called a\r\nsuccess; it is long and ambitious, but thinly written, undramatic, and\r\nnot very pleasing.\r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to Petersen-Berger is Hugo Alfvén (born 1872),\r\nSweden's most important contrapuntist. In him the national influence\r\nis reduced to a minimum, though it is sometimes to be noticed in a\r\ncertain manner of forming themes and moulding cadences. Swedish color\r\nis, however, noticeable in certain works specifically national. The\r\n_Midsommarvaka_ is built upon Swedish tunes, organized and developed in\r\nthe spirit of the classic composers. The whole spirit is intellectual\r\nand technical, but this has its agreeable side in the composer's\r\nability to build up long sustained passages. The 'Upsala Rhapsody,'\r\nopus 24, is merely an excuse for the technical manipulation of a\r\ncollection of rather cheap melodies. The symphonies are more able and\r\neven less interesting. The solidity and complexity of the polyphonic\r\nstyle excite admiration, but the themes are without distinction and\r\nthe total effect is pedantic. In his songs, however, Alfvén gives us a\r\nsurprise. His power of development here becomes something like poetic\r\ngreatness, especially where the form is free enough to give the work a\r\nsymphonic character. The voice part is unconventional, declamatory and\r\nimpressive, and the accompaniment varied and impressive. Altogether,\r\nthese songs are among the most admirable which modern Scandinavian has\r\ngiven us.\r\n\r\nAmong the other able composers of modern Sweden we should mention Tor\r\nAulin (born 1866), who has consecrated his lyric and poetic talent\r\nchiefly to the violin; Erik Akerberg (born 1860), whose classical\r\npredilections have led him to choral and symphonic work; and Wilhelm\r\nStenhammar (born 1871). The last is one of the ablest of modern Swedish\r\ncomposers, a man whose talents have by no means been adequately\r\nrecognized, and a genius, perhaps, who is destined to out-strip his\r\nbetter-known contemporaries. The list of his works includes two\r\noperas, _Tirfing_ (1898) and 'The Feast at Solhaug' (the libretto\r\nfrom Ibsen's play); string quartets, sonatas and concertos for piano\r\nand violin; large choral works, songs, and ballads with orchestral\r\naccompaniment. The piano concerto, opus 23, ranks with Grieg's finest\r\norchestral works. The themes, not always remarkable, are lifted into\r\nthe extraordinary by Stenhammar's brilliant handling of them. The A\r\nminor quartet, opus 25, shows great beauty of simple material, and an\r\nintellectual and technical dominance which lift it quite above the\r\nusual Swedish chamber music. The sonata for violin and piano, opus 19,\r\nis a fine work, simple, fresh, original and charming. In much of the\r\ninstrumental music the idiom is advanced, with the emphasis thrown on\r\nthe voice leading rather than on the harmony; but it cannot easily be\r\nreferred to a single school, for it is always personal and individually\r\nexpressive. When we come to a work like _Midvinter_, opus 24, a tone\r\npoem for large orchestra, we are at the summit of modern Scandinavian\r\nromantic writing. This work is a masterpiece. The themes, says the\r\ncomposer in a note, were taken down by ear from the fiddler Hinns\r\nAndersen, except for one, a traditional Christmas hymn which is sung\r\nby a chorus obbligato. The counterpoint in this work is masterly, the\r\nanimal vigor overwhelming. At no point is the composer found wanting\r\nin structural power or invention. On the whole, no modern Scandinavian\r\ncomposer, unless it be Sinding, approaches Stenhammar in the fusing of\r\nfresh poetry with strong intellectual and technical control. But not\r\nonly has he written some of Scandinavia's finest chamber and symphonic\r\nmusic; he has written also at least one opera which stands out from\r\namong its contemporaries as genius stands out from imitation. This is\r\n'The Feast at Solhaug,' opus 6, dated 1896, and performed at the Berlin\r\nRoyal Opera House in 1905. This work is utterly lyrical and utterly\r\nnational; it is doubtful if there is a more thoroughly Swedish work in\r\nthe whole list of modern Scandinavian music. In the vulgar sense it\r\nis not dramatic; it has little concern for square-cornered emotions\r\nand startling confrontations. Its melody, which is astonishingly\r\nabundant, is always spontaneous and always expressive. The discreetly\r\nmanaged accompaniment is unfailingly resourceful in supplying color and\r\nemotional expression. We can say without hesitation that there has been\r\nno more beautiful dramatic work in the whole history of Scandinavian\r\nopera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nNorway, as it seems, has always been a nation of great individuals.\r\nIn her early history she was as isolated socially as she was\r\ngeographically. Though nominally a part of the Swedish Empire, she\r\nalways maintained a large measure of independence, and strengthened\r\nthe barrier of high mountains with a more impassable barrier of\r\nneighborhood jealousy. Life was difficult among the mountains and\r\nfjords, and each man was obliged to depend upon his own courage and\r\nenergy. Luxury was unknown. Even civilization was primitive. Hence,\r\nwhen Norway began to attain artistic expression in the nineteenth\r\ncentury she was as provincial as a little village in the middle west of\r\nAmerica. But her life, while simple, was intense, and the narrowness\r\nof the spiritual environment fostered a broad culture of the soul.\r\nNorway became a nation of laborers, of poets, of thinkers, and of\r\nreligious seers. The very friction that opposed the current made it\r\ngive out more light.\r\n\r\nIbsen, the first supreme genius of Norway in the arts, wrote equally\r\nfrom Norway's traditional past and from Norway's circumscribed present.\r\nOut of the combination of the two he created 'Brand,' one of the\r\nnoblest poetic tragedies of modern times. His later social dramas,\r\nas we know, altered the theatre of the whole world. Beside Ibsen was\r\nBjörnson, only second to him in poetry and drama. And it was during\r\nIbsen's early years that Norway began to attain self-expression in\r\nmusic. The first composer of national significance was Waldemar Thrane\r\n(1790-1828), composer of overtures, cantatas, and dances, and of the\r\nmusic to Bjerragaard's 'Adventure in the Mountains.' But the fame of\r\nNorway was first carried outside the peninsula by Ole Bull (1810-1880),\r\nthe virtuoso violinist who, after touring through all the capitals of\r\nEurope, settled down in Pennsylvania as the founder of a Norwegian\r\ncolony. His compositions for the violin had an influence out of all\r\nproportion to their inherent value. He was a romantic voice out of the\r\nnorth to thousands who had never thought of music except in terms of\r\nMendelssohn and Händel. His Fantasies and Caprices for the violin were\r\nfilled with national melodies and national color. He was an ardent\r\npatriot, and through his national theatre in Bergen, no less than\r\nthrough his music and playing, awakened his countrymen to artistic\r\nself-consciousness.\r\n\r\nOf far wider power as a composer was Halfdan Kjerulf (1815-1863),\r\na composer of songs which stand among the best in spontaneity and\r\ndelicate charm. His charming piano pieces in the small forms were\r\nfilled with romantic color. In his many songs, simple, yet varied and\r\noriginal, he showed a power of evoking emotional response that forces\r\none to compare his talent with that of Schubert. With him we should\r\nmention E. Neupert (1842-1888), who carried the romanticism of Weber\r\nand Mendelssohn into Norway, in a long and varied list of chamber and\r\norchestral music; M. A. Udbye (1820-1889), composer of Norway's first\r\nopera _Fredkulla_; and O. Winter-Hjelm (born 1837), who was a generous\r\ncomposer of songs, choral and orchestral pieces in the conservative\r\nromantic style of Germany. Johann D. Behrens (1820-1890) proved himself\r\na valuable conductor and composer for Norway's unbelievably numerous\r\nmale singing societies.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest composer of the older romantic period was Johan\r\nSvendsen (born 1840). He was solidly grounded in the methods and\r\nideals of Schumann, Mendelssohn, Gade and even Brahms, and remained\r\nalways true to their vision. A specific national composer he was not,\r\nbut with discreet coloring he treated national subjects in such works\r\nas the 'Norwegian Rhapsody,' the 'Northern Carnival,' the legend for\r\norchestra _Zorahayde_, and the prelude to Björnson's _Sigurd Slembe_.\r\nIn the classical forms he wrote two symphonies and a number of string\r\nquartets of marked value. As a colorist he must be highly ranked. But\r\nhis color is not so much that of nationality as that of romanticism\r\nin the conventional sense. His virtues were the romantic virtues of\r\nsensuous beauty, discreet eloquence, and somewhat self-conscious\r\nemotion. But Norway found her true national propagandist in Richard\r\nNordraak (1842-1866). This man, who died at the age of twenty-four,\r\nwas a remarkably talented musician, and an unrestrained enthusiast\r\nfor the integrity of his native land, both in politics and in art. It\r\nis said that his meeting with Grieg in Copenhagen in 1864, and their\r\nlater friendly intercourse, determined the latter to the strenuously\r\nnational aspirations which he later carried to such brilliant\r\nfruition. The funeral march which Grieg inscribed to him after his\r\ndeath is one of his deepest and most moving works. Nordraak's few\r\ncompositions--incidental music to two of Björnson's plays, piano pieces\r\nand songs--show his effort after purely national coloring, but have\r\notherwise no very high value.\r\n\r\nThe great apostle of Norwegian nationalism was of course Grieg. His\r\nplace among the composers of whom we are now speaking was partly that\r\nof good angel and partly that of press agent. The other Scandinavian\r\ncomposers have basked to a great extent in the light which he shed,\r\nhave taken their inspiration from him, and have learned invaluable\r\nlessons in the art of musical picture painting. He was by no means\r\nmerely a nationalist. Besides acquainting the world with the beautiful\r\npeculiarities of Norwegian folk-song and with the fancied beauties of\r\nnorthern scenery, he showed composers in every part of the world how\r\nto use the melodic peculiarities of these songs to build up a strange\r\nand enchanting harmony, capable of calling forth mysterious pictures\r\nof the earth and sea and their superhuman inhabitants. Grieg was the\r\nfirst popular impressionist. He helped to shift the emphasis from the\r\ntechnical and emotional aspects of music to its specific pictorial\r\nand sensuous aspects. And he prepared the world at large for the idea\r\nof musical nationalism, which has become one of the two most striking\r\nfacts of present-day music.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that Grieg was the first popular impressionist we do not\r\nmean that he was more able or original than certain others who were\r\nworking with the same tendencies at the same time. His popularity\r\nresulted to a great extent from the form and manner in which he worked.\r\nHis piano music was admirably suited to making a popular appeal. It was\r\noften short and easy; it was nearly always melodious and clear. Its\r\npicturesque titles suggested a reason for its unusual turns of harmony\r\nand phrase. It was never so radical in its originality as to leave the\r\nmind bewildered. Hence Grieg became extremely popular among amateurs\r\nand casual music-lovers. His piano pieces became _Hausmusik_ as those\r\nof Mendelssohn had been a generation before. The 'impressionistic'\r\neffect was usually produced by simple means--a slight alteration of\r\nthe familiar form of cadence, a gentle blurring of the major and\r\nminor modes, an extended use of secondary sevenths and other orthodox\r\ndissonances. These interested the musical amateur without repelling\r\nhim, and, when listened to in association with the picturesque titles,\r\nsuggested all sorts of delightful sensuous things, such as the mist\r\non the mountains, the sunlight over the fjords, or the heavy green of\r\nthe seaside pines. This musical style of Grieg's was expertly managed;\r\nit was unquestionably individual and was matured to a point where it\r\nshowed no relapses to the style out of which it had developed. As\r\nan orchestral colorist Grieg was talented and original, but by no\r\nmeans revolutionary. He chose _timbres_ with a nice sense of their\r\npicturesque values, but in orchestration he is not a long step ahead of\r\nthe Mendelssohn of the overtures.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: Edvard Grieg at the Piano]\r\n                    _After a photograph from life_\r\n\r\nEdvard Hagerup Grieg, the son of Alexander Grieg, was born in Bergen,\r\nNorway, in 1843. He was descended from Alexander Greig (the spelling of\r\nthe name was changed later to accommodate the Norwegian pronunciation),\r\na merchant of Aberdeen, who emigrated from Scotland to Norway soon\r\nafter the battle of Culloden, in 1746. His father and his grandfather\r\nbefore him served as British consul at Bergen. His mother was a\r\ndaughter of Edvard Hagerup, for many years the mayor of Bergen, the\r\nsecond city of Norway. It was from her that Grieg inherited both his\r\npredisposition for music and his intensely patriotic nature. She was\r\na loyal daughter of Norway and was possessed of no small musical\r\ntalent, which her family was glad to cultivate, sending her to Hamburg\r\nin her girlhood for lessons in singing and pianoforte playing. These\r\nshe supplemented later by further musical studies in London, and she\r\nacquired sufficient skill to enable her to appear acceptably as a\r\nsoloist at orchestral concerts in Bergen. It was a home surcharged with\r\na musical atmosphere into which Edvard Grieg was born; and his mother\r\nmust have dreamed of making him a musician, for she began to give him\r\npianoforte lessons when he was only six years old.\r\n\r\nThough he disliked school (he appears to have been a typical youngster\r\nin his predilection for truancy), the boy made commendable progress\r\nin his music and even tried his hand at little compositions of his\r\nown; but before his fifteenth year there was no serious thought of\r\na musical career for him. In that year Ole Bull, the celebrated\r\nviolinist, visited his father's house, and, having heard the lad play\r\nsome of his youthful pieces, prevailed upon his parents to send him\r\nto Leipzig that he might become a professional musician. It was all\r\narranged very quickly one summer afternoon; the fond parents needed\r\nlittle coaxing, and to the boy 'it seemed the most natural thing in\r\nthe world.' Matriculated at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1858, young\r\nGrieg at first made slow progress. He studied harmony and counterpoint\r\nunder Hauptmann and Richter, composition under Rietz and Reinecke, and\r\npianoforte playing under Wenzel and Moscheles. At the conservatory at\r\nthat time were five English students, among them Arthur Sullivan, J.\r\nF. Barnett, and Edward Dannreuther, who subsequently became leaders\r\nin the musical life of London; and their unstinting toil and patience\r\nin drudgery inspired the young Norwegian to greater concentration of\r\neffort than his frail physique could stand. Under the strain he broke\r\ndown completely. An attack of pleurisy destroyed his left lung and thus\r\nhis health was permanently impaired. He was taken home to Norway,\r\nwhere it was necessary for him to remain the greater part of a year to\r\nrecuperate. But as soon as he was able he returned to Leipzig; he was\r\ngraduated with honors in 1862.\r\n\r\nAt Leipzig Grieg came strongly under the sway of Mendelssohn and\r\nSchumann. He did not escape from that influence when he went to\r\nCopenhagen in 1863 to study composition informally with Niels Gade.\r\nWhile Grieg always held Gade in high esteem, the two musicians really\r\nhad little in common, and the slight influence of the Dane was speedily\r\nsuperseded by that of Nordraak, with whom Grieg now came in contact.\r\nNordraak was ambitious to produce a genuinely national Norwegian\r\nmusic, and, brief as their friendship was, it served to set Grieg,\r\nwhose talents lay in the same direction, on the right path. Now fairly\r\nlaunched upon the career of a piano virtuoso and composer, he became\r\na 'determined adversary of the effeminate Scandinavianism which was a\r\nmixture of Gade and Mendelssohn,' and with enthusiasm entered upon the\r\nwork of developing independently in artistic forms the musical idioms\r\nof his people. In 1867 Grieg was married to Nina Hagerup, his cousin,\r\nwho had inspired and who continued to inspire many of his best songs,\r\nand whose singing of them helped to spread her husband's fame in many\r\nEuropean cities. In 1867 also he founded in Christiania a musical union\r\nof the followers of the new Norse school, which he continued to conduct\r\nfor thirteen years.\r\n\r\nBesides the giving of concerts in the chief Scandinavian and German\r\ncities and making an artistic pilgrimage to Italy Grieg at this period\r\nwas increasingly industrious in composition. He was remarkably active\r\nfor a semi-invalid. He had found himself; and he continued to develop\r\nhis creative powers in the production of music that was not only\r\nnationally idiomatic, but thoroughly suffused with the real spirit\r\nof his land and his people. In 1868 Liszt happened upon his first\r\nviolin sonata (opus 8) and forthwith sent him a cordial letter of\r\ncommendation and encouragement, inviting him to Weimar. This letter\r\nwas instrumental in inducing the Norwegian government to grant him a\r\nsum of money that enabled him to go again to Rome in 1870. There he\r\nmet Liszt and the two musicians at once became firm friends. At their\r\nsecond meeting Liszt played from the manuscript Grieg's piano concerto\r\n(opus 16), and when he had finished said: 'Keep steadily on; I tell you\r\nyou have the capability, and--do not let them intimidate you!' The big,\r\ngreat-hearted Liszt feared that the frail little man from the far north\r\nmight be in danger of intimidation; but his spirit was brave enough at\r\nall times--though he wrote to his parents: 'This final admonition was\r\nof tremendous importance to me; there was something in it that seemed\r\nto give it an air of sanctification.' Thenceforward the recognition of\r\nhis genius steadily increased. In 1872 he was appointed a member of\r\nthe Swedish Academy of Music; in 1883 a corresponding member of the\r\nMusical Academy at Leyden; in 1890 of the French Academy of Fine Arts.\r\nIn 1893 the University of Cambridge conferred on him the doctorate\r\nin music, at the same time that it honored by the bestowal of this\r\ndegree Tschaikowsky, Saint-Saëns, Boito, and Max Bruch. Except when\r\non concert tours his later years were spent chiefly at his beautiful\r\ncountry home, the villa Troldhaugen near Bergen, and there he died on\r\nSeptember 4, 1907, after an almost constant fight with death for more\r\nthan forty-five years.\r\n\r\nHans von Bülow called Grieg the Chopin of the North, and the\r\nconvenience of the sobriquet helped to give it a wider popular\r\nacceptance than it deserved, for in truth the basis for such a\r\ncomparison is rather slight. Undoubtedly Chopin's bold new harmony was\r\none of the sub-conscious forces that helped to shape Grieg's musical\r\ngenius. His mother had appreciated and delighted in Chopin's music at\r\na time when it was little understood and much underrated; and from\r\nchildhood Chopin was Grieg's best-loved composer. In his student days\r\nhe was deeply moved by the 'intense minor mood of the Slavic folk-music\r\nin Chopin's harmonies and the sadness over the unhappy fate of his\r\nnative land in his melodies.' It is certain that there is a certain\r\nkinship in the musical styles of the two men, in their refinement,\r\nin the kind and even the degree of originality with which each has\r\nenriched his art, in many of their aims and methods. While Grieg never\r\nattained to the heights of Chopin in his pianoforte music, he surpassed\r\nhis Polish predecessor in the ability to handle other instruments as\r\nwell as in his songs, of which he published no fewer than one hundred\r\nand twenty-five.\r\n\r\nThese songs we hold to constitute Grieg's loftiest achievement; and\r\nin all his music he is first of all the singer--amazingly fertile\r\nin easily comprehensible and alluring melodies. He patterned these\r\noriginal melodies after the folk-songs of that Northland he loved so\r\nardently, just as he often employed the rhythms of its folk-dances;\r\nand by these means he imparted to his work a fascinating touch of\r\nstrangeness and succeeded in evoking as if by magic the moods of the\r\nland and the people from which he sprang. On the wings of his music we\r\nare carried to the land of the fjords; we breathe its inspiriting air,\r\nand our blood dances and sings with its lusty yet often melancholy sons\r\nand daughters. Much as there is of Norway in his compositions, there is\r\nstill more of Grieg. His melodies are his own and more enchanting than\r\nthe folk-songs which provided their patterns; and as a harmonist he is\r\nboth bold and skillful.\r\n\r\nGrieg's place, as may be gathered from what has already been said,\r\nis in the small group of the world's greatest lyricists. He wrote no\r\noperas and he composed no great symphonies. His physical infirmity\r\nmilitated against the sustained effort necessary for the creation of\r\nworks in these kinds; but it is also plain from the work he did when\r\nat his best that his inclination and his powers led him into other\r\nfields. He possessed the dramatic qualities and ability only slightly,\r\nthe epic still less, though it cannot be denied that in moments of rare\r\nexaltation he was 'a poet of the tragic, of the largely passionate and\r\nelemental.' His nearest approach to symphonic breadth is to be found\r\nin his pianoforte concerto, which Dr. Niemann pronounces the most\r\nbeautiful work of its kind since Schumann, his sonatas for violin and\r\npianoforte, his string quartet and his 'Peer Gynt' music. Yet these\r\nbeautiful and stirring compositions are, after all, only lyrics of a\r\nlarger growth. Grieg himself knew well his powers and his limitations,\r\nand he was as modest as he was candid when he wrote: 'Artists like Bach\r\nand Beethoven erected churches and temples on the heights. I wanted, as\r\nIbsen expresses it in one of his last dramas, to build dwellings for\r\nmen in which they might feel at home and happy. In other words, I have\r\nrecorded the folk-music of my land. In style and form I have remained a\r\nGerman romanticist of the Schumann school; but at the same time I have\r\ndipped from the rich treasures of native folk-song and sought to create\r\na national art out of this hitherto unexploited expression of the\r\nfolk-soul of Norway.' The spirit of the man recalls the pretty little\r\nquatrain of Thomas Bailey Aldrich:\r\n\r\n    'I would be the lyric,\r\n      Ever on the lip,\r\n    Rather than the epic\r\n      Memory lets slip.'\r\n\r\nAnd this is not to disparage pure and simple song. It is enough for\r\nEdvard Grieg's lasting fame that he did have in rare abundance the pure\r\nlyric quality--that close and delicate touch upon the heart strings\r\nwhich makes them vibrate in sympathy with all the little importances\r\nand importunities of individual human life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nThe one Norwegian composer, besides Grieg, who has attained an\r\ninternational position, is Christian Sinding (born 1856). He is\r\nconsciously and genuinely national, but in almost every other way is a\r\ncomplement and contrast to the other northern master. Where Grieg is\r\nbest in the idyllic, Sinding is best in the heroic. Sinding is apt to\r\nbe trivial where Grieg is at his best--namely, in the smaller forms.\r\nOn the other hand, Sinding is noble and inspiring in works too long\r\nfor Grieg to sustain. In Sinding the Wagnerian influence is marked\r\nand inescapable. He, like Grieg, is most at home when working with\r\nnative material--the sharp rhythms, short periods and angular line of\r\nthe Norwegian folk-song--but he develops it objectively where Grieg\r\ndeveloped it intensively. Sinding need not work from the pictorial;\r\nGrieg was obliged to. Sinding's speech is much more cosmopolitan,\r\nhis harmony less pronounced, his form more conventional. At times he\r\nattains a high level of emotional expression. On the other hand, he\r\nhas written much, and his reputation has suffered thereby. Frequently\r\nhe is uninspired. But the sustained magnificence of his orchestral and\r\nchamber music has done much to offset the prevailing idea that the\r\nnorthern composers could work only in the parlor or _genre_ style. He\r\nsounds the epic and heroic note too often and with too much inspiration\r\nto permit us to question the greatness of his art.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in most of the established forms. His D minor symphony,\r\nopus 21, is one of the noblest in all Scandinavian music. His symphonic\r\npoem, 'Perpetual Motion,' with its inexhaustible energy and its\r\nglittering orchestral color, takes a high rank in modern orchestral\r\nmusic. His chamber music--quartets, quintets, trios, violin sonatas,\r\netc.--is distinguished by melodic inspiration, vigorous counterpoint,\r\nand sustained structural power. His piano concerto and two violin\r\nconcertos, and his grandiose E-flat minor variations for two pianos,\r\nhave taken a firm place in concert programmes. As a piano composer in\r\nthe smaller forms he is of course less personal, less distinguished,\r\nthan Grieg. But every piano student knows his _Frühlingsrauschen_\r\nand _Marche Grotesque_. As a song composer he may justly be ranked\r\nsecond to Grieg in all the Scandinavian lands. His power and sincerity\r\nin the shorter strophic song is astonishing; his strophes have the\r\ncogency and finish of the Swedish folk-song combined with the intensity\r\nand sincerity of the Norwegian. In his longer songs he is noble and\r\ndramatic; he is a master of poignant emotional expression and of\r\nsustained and mounting energy. Two of his familiar songs--'The Mother'\r\nand 'A Bird Cried'--are masterpieces of the first rank. Sinding's\r\nharmony is vigorous. An 'impressionist' in the modern sense of the\r\nterm he is not. He loves the use of marked dissonance for specific\r\neffect; his harmonic style is broad, solidly based, square-cornered.\r\nIt is regrettable, perhaps, that he did not work more in opera; his\r\nonly dramatic work, 'The Holy Mountain,' was performed in Germany early\r\nin 1914. But this fact doubtless furnishes us the reason, for Norway\r\ndoes not offer a career for an opera composer, who must depend for his\r\nsuccess on great wealth and large cities. As it is, Sinding has made a\r\nhigh, perhaps a permanent, place for himself in chamber and orchestral\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nJohan Selmer (born 1844) has taken a place as the most radical of\r\nthe 'new romanticists' in Norway. His work is extensive and varied,\r\nand is most impressive in the larger forms. He has written a series\r\nof symphonic poems, several large choral works, many part songs and\r\nballads, and the usual quota of _Lieder_. His chief influences were\r\nWagner, Liszt, and Berlioz. He can hardly be called a nationalist in\r\nmusic, for his work shows little northern feeling except where he\r\nmakes use of specific Norwegian tunes; indeed he seems equally willing\r\nto get his local color from Turkey or Italy. His work is thoroughly\r\ndisappointing; modelling himself on the giants, he has been obliged to\r\nmake himself a gigantic mask of paper. Neither his melodic inspiration,\r\nhis structural power, nor his technical learning was equal to the task\r\nhe set himself. His chief orchestral work, 'Prometheus,' opus 50, is\r\nridiculously inadequate to its grandiose subject. His _Finnländischer\r\nFestklang_ is the most ordinary sort of rhapsody on borrowed material.\r\nOf his other works we need only say that they reveal abundantly\r\nthe effect of large ambitions on a little man. Along with Selmer\r\nwe may mention three opera composers of Norway, none sufficiently\r\ndistinguished to carry his name beyond the national border: Johannes\r\nHaarklou (born 1847), Cath. Elling (born 1858) and Ole Olsen (born\r\n1850). The last, though yet 'unproduced' as a dramatic composer,\r\ndeserves to be better known than he is. His symphonic and piano music\r\nis pleasing without being distinguished; but the operas _Lajla_ and\r\n_Hans Unversagt_ are charmingly colorful and melodic, revealing musical\r\nscholarship and fine emotional expression. Finally we may mention\r\nJohann Halvorsen (born 1864), a follower of Grieg and an able composer\r\nfor violin and male chorus.\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising of the younger Norwegians was Sigurd Lie\r\n(1871-1904), whose early death cut off a career which bade fair to\r\nbe internationally distinguished. Surely he would have been one of\r\nthe most national of Norwegian composers. His list of works, brief\r\nbecause of ill health, includes a symphony in A minor, a symphonic\r\nmarch, an oriental suite for orchestra, a piano quintet, a goodly list\r\nof short piano pieces, and many songs and choral works. He used the\r\nNorwegian folk-song intensively, combining its spirit with that of the\r\nold ecclesiastical tone. He was a true poet of music; his moods were\r\nusually mystic, gray and religious, and his effects, even in simple\r\npiano pieces, were obtained with astonishing sureness. His harmony,\r\nthough not radical, was personal and highly expressive. His songs,\r\nmuch sung in his native land, reveal a genius for precise and poignant\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular of Norway's living composers for the piano is\r\nHalfdan Cleve (born 1879), writer of numerous works of which those in\r\nthe large forms are most important. Cleve is cosmopolitan, enamored\r\nof large effects, and of dazzling virtuosity. His technique is varied\r\nand exceedingly sure, but he lacks the appealing loveliness which has\r\nbrought reputation to the works of so many of his countrymen. More\r\npopular is Agathe Backer-Gröndahl (born 1847), industrious writer of\r\npiano pieces in the smaller forms. Outwardly a classicist, she has\r\ndrunk of the lore of Grieg and has achieved charming and able works,\r\ndistinguished by delicate feeling and care for detail. Her children's\r\nsongs are altogether delightful. But when she attempts longer works her\r\ninspiration is apt to fail her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most original and personal composer after Grieg and Sinding\r\nis Gerhard Schjelderup (born 1859), a tone poet of much technical\r\nability and genuine national feeling. His songs and ballads are very\r\nfine, striking the heroic note with sincerity and conviction. In his\r\nsimple songs and piano pieces, Schjelderup's innate feeling for the\r\nfolk-tone makes him utterly successful. In his operas, 'Norwegian\r\nWedding,' 'Beyond Sun and Moon,' 'A People in Distress,' and his\r\nincidental music, he lacks the dramatic and structural power for long\r\nsustained passages; but his genius for expressive simplicity has filled\r\nthese works with beauties. Schjelderup's symphonies and chamber music\r\nhave made a place for themselves in European concert halls equally by\r\ntheir freshness of feeling and by their excellence of technique.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VI\r\n\r\nFinland's music, centred in its capital Helsingfors, was from the first\r\nunder German domination. The national spirit, as we have seen, grew\r\nup under the inspiration of the _Kalevala_, then newly made known to\r\nliterature. The first national composer of note was Frederick Pacius\r\n(1809-1891), born in Hamburg, but regarded as the founder of the\r\nnational Finnish school. He was under the Mendelssohnian domination,\r\nbut gave no little national color to his music and helped to centre the\r\ngrowing national consciousness. Besides symphonies, a violin concerto\r\nand male choruses, he wrote an opera 'King Karl's Hunt,' and several\r\n_Singspiele_ which contained national flavor without any specific\r\nnational material. To Pacius Finland owes her official national\r\nanthem. Other Finnish composers of note were Karl Collan (1828-1871),\r\nF. von Schantz (1835-1865) and C. G. Wasenus. The Wagnerian influence\r\nfirst penetrated the land of lakes in the works of Martin Wegelius\r\n(1846-1906), able composer of operas, piano and orchestral music, and\r\nchoral works. But the first specific national tendency in Finnish music\r\nis due to Robert Kajanus (born 1856), who achieved the freshness and\r\nprimitive force of the national folk-song in works of Wagnerian power\r\nand scope. Besides his piano and lyric pieces we possess several\r\nsymphonic poems of his--including _Aino_ and _Kullervo_--all markedly\r\nnational in feeling.\r\n\r\nAmong the modern Finnish composers of second rank Armas Järnefelt (born\r\n1869) is distinguished. In orchestral suites, symphonic poems (for\r\nexample, the _Heimatklang_), overtures, choral works, piano pieces,\r\nand songs, he has shown spontaneity and technical learning. Poetic\r\nfeeling and sensitive coloring are marked in his work. Much the same\r\ncan be said of Erik Melartin (born 1875), except that his genius is\r\nmore specifically lyric. His songs reflect the energy and freshness\r\nof a race just coming to consciousness. His smaller piano pieces show\r\nsomewhat the salon influence of Sweden, but in all we feel that the\r\nartist is speaking. Ernst Mielck (1877-1899) had made a place for\r\nhimself with his symphony and other orchestral works when death cut\r\nshort his career. Oscar Merikanto (born 1868) has written, besides\r\none opera, many songs and piano pieces, most of them conventional and\r\nundistinguished, and Selim Palmgren (born 1878) has already attained a\r\nwide reputation.\r\n\r\nIn Sibelius we meet one of the most powerful composers in modern\r\nmusic. Masterpiece after masterpiece has come from his pen, and the\r\nworks which fall short of distinction are few indeed. He is at once\r\nthe most national and the most personal composer in the whole history\r\nof Scandinavian music. His style is like no one else's; his themes,\r\nhis mode of development, his harmonic 'atmosphere,' and his orchestral\r\ncoloring are quite his own. But his materials are, with hardly an\r\nexception, drawn from the literature and folk-lore of the Finnish\r\nnation; his melodies, when not closely allied to the folk-melodies of\r\nhis land, are so true to their spirit that they evoke instant response\r\nin his countrymen's hearts; and the moods and emotions which he\r\nexpresses are those that are rooted deepest in the Finnish character.\r\nThis powerful national tradition and feeling of which he is the\r\nspokesman he has vitalized with a creative energy which is equalled\r\nonly by the few greatest composers of the world to-day. He has touched\r\nno department of music which he has not enriched with powerful and\r\noriginal works. As an innovator, pure and simple, he seems likely to\r\nprove one of the most productive forces in modern music. No deeper,\r\nmore moving voice has ever come out of the north; only in modern Russia\r\ncan anything so distinctly national and so supremely beautiful be found.\r\n\r\nJean Sibelius was born in Finland in 1865 and at first studied for the\r\nlaw. Shifting to music, he entered the conservatory at Helsingfors\r\nand worked under Wegelius. Later he studied in Berlin and thereafter\r\nwent to Vienna. Here, under Goldmark, he developed his taste for\r\npowerful instrumental color, and under Robert Fuchs his concern for\r\nfinely wrought detail. But even in his early works there was little\r\nof the German influence to be traced beyond thorough workmanship.\r\nWith his symphonic poem, _En Saga_, opus 9, he became recognized as\r\na national composer. The Finns, longing for self-expression, looked\r\nto him eagerly. They had, as Dr. Niemann[11] has put it, been made\r\nsilent heroes by their struggles with forest, plain, cataract and\r\nsea, and by the bitter recent political conflict with Russia. And,\r\nas always happens in such cases, they sought to give expression to\r\ntheir suppressed national ideals in art. Sibelius's symphonic poem,\r\n_Finlandia_, is a thinly veiled revolutionary document and his great\r\nmale chorus, 'The Song of the Athenians' (words by the Finnish poet\r\nRydberg), gave verbal expression to the thoughts of the patriots of\r\nthe nation. The former piece has explicitly been banned in Finland by\r\nRussian edict because of its inflammatory influence on the people.\r\nBut all this has not made Sibelius a political figure such as Wagner\r\nbecame in 1848. He has worked industriously and copiously at his music,\r\nwatching it go round the civilized world, keeping himself aloof the\r\nwhile from outward turmoil, though his personal sympathies are known to\r\nbe strongly nationalistic.\r\n\r\nIt was the symphonic poems which first made Sibelius a world-figure.\r\nThese include a tetralogy, _Lemminkäinen_, consisting of 'Lemminkäinen\r\nand the Village Maidens,' 'The River of Tuonela,' 'The Swan of\r\nTuonela,' and 'Lemminkäinen's Home-faring'; _Finlandia_, _En Saga_,\r\n'Spring Song,' and the more recent 'Spirits of the Ocean' and\r\n'Pohjola's Daughter.' The _Lemminkäinen_ series is based on the\r\nKalevala tale, which narrates the adventures of the hero Lemminkäinen,\r\nhis departure to the river of death (Tuonela), his death there, and\r\nthe magic by which his mother charmed his dismembered limbs to come\r\ntogether and the man to come to life. Of the four separate works which\r\nmake up the series 'The Swan of Tuonela' is the most popular. It was\r\nin this that Sibelius's original mastery of orchestral tone was first\r\nmade known to foreign audiences. With its enchanting theme sung by\r\nthe English horn it weaves a long, slow spell of the utmost beauty.\r\n_Finlandia_ tells of the struggles of a submerged nation; the early\r\nparts of the work are filled with passionate excitement and military\r\nbustle; then there emerges the motive of all this struggle--a majestic\r\nchorale melody, scored with the strings in all their resonance, a\r\nsong at once of battle and of devotion, a melody for whose equal we\r\nmust go to Beethoven and Wagner. _En Saga_, the earliest of the great\r\nnationalistic works, is without a definite program, but is dramatic in\r\nthe highest degree. It is a masterpiece of free form, with its long,\r\nswelling climaxes and passionate adagios, surrounded by a haze of\r\nshimmering tone-color, as though the bard were singing his story among\r\nthe fogs of the northern cliffs. The national character of these works\r\nis quite as marked in their themes as in their subject-matter. Sibelius\r\nis fond of the strange rhythms of the old times--3/4, 7/4, 2/2, or 3/2\r\ntime. His accent is almost crudely exaggerated. His original themes are\r\nso true to the national character that they seem made of one piece with\r\nthe folk-tunes. The mood of these works is rarely gay; the animation\r\nis primitive and savage. The prevailing spirit is one of loneliness\r\nand gloom. In the symphonic poems, which grow increasingly free in\r\nharmony, we see in all its glory the orchestral scoring which is one of\r\nSibelius's chief claims to fame. It is no mere virtuoso brilliancy, as\r\nis often the case with Rimsky-Korsakoff. It is always an accentuation\r\nof the character of the music with the character of the tone of the\r\ninstrument chosen. It is color from a heavy palette, chosen chiefly\r\nfrom the deeper shades, showing its contrast in modulation of tones\r\nrather than high lights, yet kept always free of the turgid and muddy.\r\n\r\nThe same qualities are shown in the four symphonies. Of these the last\r\nis a thing of revolutionary import--a daring work whose full meaning\r\nto the future of music has not begun to be appreciated. The other\r\nthree are perhaps less symphonies than symphonic rhapsodies. They seem\r\nto imply a program, being filled with episodes, dramatic, epic, and\r\nlyrical, interspersed with recitative and legend-like passages. But,\r\nhowever free the form, the architecture is cogent. In his development\r\nwork Sibelius is always masterly. Some of the passages, like the main\r\ntheme of the first movement of the first symphony, or the slow movement\r\nfrom the same, are amazing in their imaginative power and beauty. The\r\nfourth symphony is a work apart. In the first and second movements the\r\nharmony is quite as radical as anything in modern German or French\r\nmusic. It is, in fact, hardly harmony at all, but the free interplay of\r\nmonophonic voices.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Jean Sibelius]\r\n                   _After a photo from life (1913)_\r\n\r\nFrom this method, which at the present moment is almost Sibelius's\r\nprivate property, the composer extracts a quality of poetry which is\r\nimpressive in its suggestions of great things beyond.\r\n\r\nSome of Sibelius's best music has been written to accompany dramatic\r\nperformances. That for Adolph Paul's play, 'King Christian II,'\r\nhas been widely played as an orchestral suite. The introduction is\r\nespecially fine. The warm and sweetly melancholy nocturne, the 'Elegy'\r\nfor strings, and the profoundly moving Dance of Death are all movements\r\nof rare beauty. The lovely _Valse Triste_, a mimic drama in itself,\r\nwritten for Järnefelt's play, _Kuolema_, has carried his reputation\r\nfar and wide, as the C sharp minor prelude carried Rachmaninoff's, or\r\nthe 'Melody in F' Rubinstein's. There are, further, two orchestral\r\nsuites from the accompanying music to Maeterlinck's 'Pelléas and\r\nMélisande,' and Procopé's 'Belshazzar's Feast.' For orchestra we may\r\nfurther mention the _Karelia_ Overture, the _Scènes historiques_, the\r\nDance-Intermezzo, 'Pan and Echo,' the melancholy waltzes to accompany\r\nStrindberg's 'Snowwhite,' the two canzonettas for small orchestras, the\r\nRomance in C major for string orchestra, the short symphonic poem, 'The\r\nDryads,' and the Funeral march.\r\n\r\nThe violin concerto, one of the most difficult of the kind in\r\nexistence, has already gained its place among the standard concert\r\npieces for the instrument. It shows deep feeling and national color,\r\nespecially in the rhythmically vigorous finale. The string quartet,\r\n_Voces Intimæ_, opus 56, is a masterly work in a reserved style. The\r\nfirst three movements are said to have as a sort of program certain\r\nchapters from Swedenborg. The piano music is generally on a lower\r\nplane. To a great extent it recalls Schumann and Tschaikowsky; in\r\nsuch works as the _Characterstücke_, opera 5, 24, 41, and 58, in the\r\nsonatina, opus 67, and in the rondinos, opus 68, we find little that\r\ncan be called original. But we must remember that in these pieces\r\nSibelius was writing music to appeal to the people, and has succeeded\r\nto a remarkable degree in raising the general standard of taste in\r\nhis native land. For his most personal piano work we must look to\r\nhis transcriptions of Finnish tunes, especially 'The Fratricide' and\r\n'Evening Comes.'\r\n\r\nIn his songs for solo voice Sibelius has achieved remarkable things.\r\nThe remarkable 'Autumn Evening' is a sort of free recitative, always\r\nverging on melody, accompanied by suggestive descriptive figures in the\r\npiano part. Here we see in germ one of his most important contributions\r\nto modern music--an emphasis on expressive monody. The ballad, _Des\r\nFahrmanns Braut_, which has been arranged for orchestral accompaniment,\r\nis weaker musically, but shows the same genius for expressive melodic\r\nrecitative. And not the least important and characteristic part of\r\nSibelius's work has been in the form of male choruses. Of these we may\r\nmention 'The Origin of Fire' and 'The Imprisoned Queen,' both with\r\norchestral accompaniment, and, above all, the magnificent 'Song of the\r\nAthenians,' which has come to have a national significance among the\r\nFinns. As we look over this remarkable list of works, from the great\r\nsymphonic forms down to brief songs, and note the quantity of germinal\r\noriginality they contain, their high poetry, their universal beauty and\r\nintense national expression, we must adjudge Sibelius to be a master\r\nwith a creative vitality which cannot be matched by more than half a\r\ndozen composers writing to-day.\r\n\r\n                                                           H.

This belongs to the middle\r\nof the past century, when the seed sown by Glinka, Dargomijsky and\r\npartly by Bortniansky began to bear its first fruits. Up to that time\r\nthe question of Russian national music had not been aroused. The\r\ncountry was dominated either by German or the Italian musical ideals.\r\nArt, particularly music, was in every direction aristocratic, academic,\r\nand pedantically ecclesiastic. The ruling class was foreign to the core\r\nand followed literally the timely æsthetic fads of other countries. The\r\nidea that there could be any art in the life of a moujik was ridiculed\r\nand flatly denied. _O, Bóje sohraní!_ a patron of music would exclaim\r\nat any attempts at a national music.\r\n\r\nTo the middle class and the common people the admission to high-class\r\nmusical performances and the opera was legally denied. The concerts\r\nof the Imperial Musical Society and the performances of the Imperial\r\nOpera were meant only for the _élite_, and the direction of those\r\ninstitutions was in the hands of bureaucratic foreigners. It was at\r\na critical moment that Balakireff, who had come as a young lawyer\r\nfrom Nijny Novgorod to St. Petersburg, laid the foundation of the Free\r\nSchool of Music. This institution was meant to train young Russians,\r\nto arouse in them an enthusiasm for the possibilities latent in their\r\nnative music, and at the same time to arrange free concerts for the\r\npeople and perform the works of those native composers who were\r\nturned away by the existing organizations. Founded by Balakireff,\r\nthe composer, Lomakin, the talented choirmaster, and Stassoff, the\r\ncelebrated critic, the free school became the institution of Borodine,\r\nMoussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakoff. Balakireff, Borodine and Moussorgsky\r\ncan be considered as the real founders of the Russian 'realistic'\r\nschool of music, if not the pioneers of a new musical art movement\r\naltogether. Upon their principles and examples rest the original vigor\r\nand the subjective glamour of all subsequent Russian music. The vague\r\ninitiative given by Glinka and Dargomijsky underwent a thorough process\r\nof reconstruction at the hands of these three reformers; the stamp\r\nset by them upon the Russian music is as unique and as lasting as the\r\nsemi-oriental spirit that permeates Russian life and character with its\r\nexotic magic.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of building up an art out of national material seemed to\r\nhang in the air, for this was the time of a great national awakening\r\nin Russia. Gogol, Lermontov, Pushkin, Dostoievsky, and Turgenieff in\r\npoetry and fiction, Griboiedoff and Ostrovsky in the drama, Stassoff,\r\nHertzen, and Mihailovsky in critical literature, and the revolutionary\r\nmovement of the so-called _narodno-volts_ in politics were all symptoms\r\nof a vigorous reform period. It should be noted that in this great\r\nand far-reaching movement the Russian church, with all its seeming\r\nsupremacy, exercised but little influence over matters of art and\r\nliterature. While the church in Western Europe was aristocratic in\r\nits institutions, in Russia it remained throughout the centuries\r\ndemocratic. A Russian clergyman has remained nothing but a more or\r\nless refined moujik, a man who lives the life of the common people and\r\nassociates with the people. As such he has never been antagonistic to\r\nthe spirit of the common people, as far as their æsthetic tendencies\r\nand traditions are concerned. He has never tried to make art an issue\r\nof the church. Music, less than any other of the arts, has never been\r\ninfluenced in any way by ecclesiastical interests. No instrumental\r\nmusic of any kind has ever been performed in Russian churches. Hence,\r\nunlike those of Western Europe, Russian composers never came under the\r\nsway of the church. The western church was, as we have seen, originally\r\nopposed to the influence of folk music. In Russia, on the other hand,\r\nit favored any assertion of the people's individuality. It was,\r\ntherefore, unlike the aristocratic classes, sympathetic to such a work\r\nas that which the Free School of Music made the object of its existence.\r\n\r\nBefore treating the works of the three great Russian reformers\r\nindividually we may remark that none of them made music his sole\r\nprofession. Balakireff was sufficiently well off to devote himself to\r\nhis art without thought of material gain. Borodine earned his living\r\nas a scholar and pedagogue, and so maintained his independence as a\r\ncomposer. Moussorgsky alone felt the pinch of poverty; his official\r\nduties were strenuous and left him little leisure for composition. Yet,\r\nlike his colleagues, he never compromised with public taste.\r\n\r\nThe real initiator of this new movement, Mily Alekseyevitch Balakireff,\r\nwas born at Nijny Novgorod in 1837. He studied law at the University\r\nof Kazan, though music was his hobby from early childhood on. His\r\nmusical ideals were Mozart, Beethoven, and Berlioz. During one of his\r\nsummer vacations Balakireff met in the country near Nijny Novogorod a\r\ncertain Mr. Oulibitcheff, a retired diplomat and friend of Glinka, an\r\naccomplished musician himself and thoroughly familiar with the classic\r\ncomposers of every country. It was he who converted Balakireff to the\r\nidea that Russia should have its own music, and that the lines to be\r\nfollowed should be those indicated by Glinka. With an introduction to\r\nthat apostle of nationalism Balakireff journeyed to St. Petersburg in\r\n1855. He found the city under the spell of German and Italian music,\r\nand the masses limited to the musical enjoyment to be derived from\r\nmilitary bands and boulevard artists. With all the youthful energy at\r\nhis command Balakireff set himself to combat the foreign influence and\r\nadvance nationalistic ideas of music.\r\n\r\nBalakireff was an artist such as perhaps only Russia can produce.\r\nWithout really systematic study he was an accomplished musician\r\ntheoretically and practically. No existing method could measure up\r\nto his ideas of musical study. He had mastered the classics and\r\nmade their technique his own; his contemporaries he approached in a\r\ncritical spirit, appropriating what was good and rejecting what he\r\nconsidered wrong. His watchword was individual liberty. 'I believe in\r\nthe subjective, not in the objective power of music,' he said to his\r\npupils. 'Objective music may strike us with its brilliancy, but its\r\nachievement remains the handiwork of a mediocre talent. Mediocre or\r\nmerely talented musicians are eager to produce _effects_, but the ideal\r\nof a genius is to reproduce his very self, in unison with the object\r\nof his art. There is no doubt that art requires technique, but it must\r\nbe absolutely unconscious and individual.... Often the greatest pieces\r\nof art are rather rude technically, but they grip the soul and command\r\nattention for intrinsic values. This is apparent in the works of\r\nMichelangelo, of Shakespeare, of Turgenieff, and of Mozart. The beauty\r\nthat fascinates us most is that which is most individual. I regard\r\ntechnique as a necessary but subservient element. It may, however,\r\nbecome dangerous and kill individuality as it has done with those\r\nfavorites of our public, whose virtuosity I despise more than mere\r\ncrudities.'\r\n\r\nThe man who launched such a theory at a time when the rest of the world\r\nwas merged in admiration of Wagner and his technique was an interesting\r\ncombination of a scholar, poet, revolutionist, and agitator.\r\nWagner, Rubinstein, and Tschaikowsky were technicians in his eyes,\r\nwhose creative power moved merely in the old-fashioned channels of\r\nclassicism. Of the rest of his contemporaries Liszt was the only genius\r\nworthy of attention. Between Balakireff, Rubinstein, and Tschaikowsky\r\nthere was continual strife.[12] Rubinstein headed the newly founded\r\nImperial Conservatory, Balakireff his Free School of Music. On\r\nRubinstein's side were the members of high society, the music critics\r\nand the bureaucratic power. Balakireff and his group of young composers\r\nwere outcasts. Music critics and public opinion stamped him a conceited\r\ndilettante, only a handful of intellectuals subscribed to his creed.\r\n\r\nBalakireff's first composition was a fantasia on Russian themes for\r\npiano and orchestra, which he afterward rearranged for an orchestral\r\noverture. In 1861 he composed the music to 'King Lear,' which is his\r\nonly work of a dramatic character. An opera, 'The Golden Bird,' which\r\nhe commenced some years later, was never completed. One of the most\r\nsignificant of Balakireff's early works is the symphonic poem 'Russia,'\r\ncommemorating the thousandth anniversary of the inauguration of the\r\nRussian empire by Rurik. That his own works are rather limited in\r\nnumber is explained by the fact that he spent most of his best years\r\nin organizing his campaign and in criticising the compositions of his\r\nfollowers. The symphonic poem 'Tamara,' some twenty songs and ballades,\r\n'Islamey,' an oriental fantasy for piano, which was one of the most\r\ncherished numbers in Liszt's repertoire, and his symphonic poem\r\n'Bohemia' represent the best fruits of his genius. His First and Second\r\nSymphonies are very beautiful, original and Russian in feeling, but\r\nthey have somehow remained behind his above-mentioned works. Very fiery\r\nand popular are his two concertos, the Spanish Overture and a number of\r\ndances. 'Tamara' is a real gem of oriental wickedness and fascination.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Balakireff was appointed conductor of the Imperial Musical\r\nSociety and later of the court choir. In 1874 he retired from the\r\ndirectorship of the Free School of Music and the post was taken over\r\nby Rimsky-Korsakoff. From this time until his death Balakireff lived\r\nin seclusion in his comfortable home in St. Petersburg and avoided\r\nsociety. He died in 1910, having outlived all his contemporaries and\r\nmany of his pupils. The last period of his life was overshadowed by\r\na strange mystic obsession which caused him to destroy many of his\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nAn artist of wholly different cast was Alexander Porphyrievitch\r\nBorodine. While Balakireff was the positive type of an active man, a\r\nborn organizer and agitator, Borodine was a dreamer and tender-souled\r\npoet, the true Bohemian of his time. He was a most remarkable\r\ncombination of very unusual abilities: Borodine the surgeon and\r\ndoctor enjoyed a nation-wide reputation; Borodine the chemist made\r\nmany valuable discoveries and wrote treatises which were recognized\r\nuniversally as remarkable contributions to science; Borodine the\r\nphilanthropist and educator was tireless from early morning till night;\r\nBorodine the flutist, violinist, and pianist rivalled the best virtuosi\r\nof his time; and Borodine the composer was, according to Liszt, one of\r\nthe most gifted orchestral masters of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nHere is what Borodine writes of his visit to the hero of Weimar in\r\n1877: 'Scarcely had I sent my card in when there arose before me, as\r\nthough out of the ground, a long black frock-coat, and long white hair.\r\n\"You have written a fine symphony,\" he began in a resonant voice. \"I\r\nam delighted to see you. Only two days ago I played your symphony to\r\nthe grand duke, who was wholly charmed with it. The first movement is\r\nperfect. Your andante is a masterpiece. The scherzo is enchanting, and\r\nthen, this passage is wonderful--great!\"' This was his Second Symphony,\r\nwhich Felix Weingartner has called one of the most beautiful orchestral\r\nworks ever written.\r\n\r\nUnder what circumstances he produced his enchanting beauties is best\r\nevidenced from one of his letters to his wife in 1873: 'Thursday I\r\ngave two lectures for women [on surgery], received clothes sent from\r\nthe institution, had a letter from Butleroff to take dinner with him\r\nand then to attend the meeting of the chemists. I brought there all my\r\nmaterial and gave an account of my experiments. Then, Mendeleyev [the\r\nfamous chemist] took me to his house. I worked this morning as usual,\r\ntook dinner with Miety at Sorokina. Then Raida and Kleopatra called on\r\nme to request space for a sick man in the hospital.'\r\n\r\nWho would believe that a man of such a versatile nature was at the\r\nsame time one of the finest composers and musicians of his generation?\r\nIn another letter to his wife he writes how he rushes madly from his\r\nlaboratory to his musical study, sits furiously at the piano and starts\r\nto pour out the musical ideas that have haunted him day and night. His\r\nfriends thought he would never be able to continue such a triple life\r\nfor any length of time and urged him to devote himself merely to music.\r\nBut to him this change of thought and work seemed a recreation and he\r\nlived in this very turmoil until he died.\r\n\r\nBorodine was born in St. Petersburg in 1834. His father was Prince\r\nGedeanoff, a descendant of the hereditary rulers of the kingdom of\r\nImeretia in the Caucasus, and his mother, Mme. Kleineke, the widow of\r\nan army doctor in Narva. Borodine's oriental tendency can be traced\r\nback through his family. His nationalism was truly spontaneous and\r\ngenuine, in spite of the fact that, unlike his colleagues, Balakireff\r\nand Moussorgsky, he never had an opportunity to come in contact with\r\nthe peasantry. Borodine's nationalism is a product of heredity and owes\r\nnothing to environment.\r\n\r\nHaving studied medicine in the famous Military Surgery School in St.\r\nPetersburg, Borodine became a professor in the same institution after\r\na short practice as a surgeon in various hospitals of the capital.\r\nHe was, even as a student in college, an accomplished virtuoso in\r\nmusic. At the age of eighteen he had composed a concerto for violin\r\nand piano. But his real musical creative activity started when he met\r\nBalakireff and the members of his circle, to whom he was introduced\r\nby Moussorgsky, then a young officer of the guard in the military\r\nhospital. Though filled with Balakireff's ideals, Borodine was not\r\nclose to his teacher. Balakireff's ideas were grand in outline, but\r\nrather rough in detail; Borodine's preferences were toward refinement\r\nin detail and melodic form. Though the opera 'Prince Igor' may be\r\nconsidered Borodine's masterpiece, he has enriched Russian musical\r\nliterature by exquisite examples of orchestral composition--of which\r\nhis Second Symphony and the symphonic poem 'In Steppes of Central Asia'\r\nare the best--chamber music, songs and dances. Borodine's orchestral\r\ncompositions excel in richness of coloring and in the dramatic vigor of\r\nhis melodies. Withal he has an almost mathematical mastery of form and\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nFrom all his works emanates a distinctly lyric Slavic-Oriental glow of\r\nsound--brilliant, passionate, gay, and painful in turns. In the words\r\nof a modern Russian composer, 'it is individually descriptive and\r\nextremely modern--so modern that the audiences of to-day will not be\r\nable to grasp all its intrinsic beauties.'\r\n\r\nIn 'Prince Igor' Borodine has produced a work that has nothing in\r\ncommon with either Italian or German operas. He employs a libretto\r\nof legendary character, such as Wagner used for his operas, but in\r\nconstruction and style he follows the very opposite direction of the\r\nGerman master. The dramatic plot is almost lacking in the conventional\r\nsense, but the interest of the audience is kept in suspense by means of\r\na unique musical beauty, by stage effects and the dramatic truth that\r\nshows itself in every detail of the action.\r\n\r\nAs compared with Balakireff and Moussorgsky, Borodine was an\r\naristocratic figure in thought and inclination. He was more chivalrous\r\nand lyric in his style and more imaginative in his form, therefore less\r\ndramatic and less elemental. Borodine's great significance for Russian\r\nmusic lies in his individual form of melodic thought and the relation\r\nof that thought to human life. His realism verged on the point of\r\nimpressionistic symbolism, in which he surpassed both Balakireff and\r\nMoussorgsky. He gave to Russian music new forms of romantic realism,\r\nforms that have been used and perfected by the composers who have\r\nfollowed him. Unlike Balakireff and Moussorgsky, Borodine was married\r\nand lived a happy family life. He died suddenly at a costume-ball in\r\nSt. Petersburg in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nOf all artists one of the most fought and ridiculed, the least\r\nrecognized and a figure almost ignored, yet doubtless the greatest\r\npersonality in Russian musical history, was Modest Petrovitch\r\nMoussorgsky. It has remained for the present generation, especially\r\nfor men like Rimsky-Korsakoff, Claude Debussy, Richard Strauss, and\r\nHugo Wolf, to appreciate this most original musical genius of the\r\nlast century. Rubinstein and Tschaikowsky spoke of Moussorgsky as of\r\na talented musical heretic, regarding his compositions as the result\r\nof accidental inspiration, crude in their workmanship and primitive in\r\ntheir form. Though his name was known through Russia to some extent,\r\nespecially after Rimsky-Korsakoff had secured for him some professional\r\nsuccess, he remained always a minor character. This lasted until the\r\nbeginning of this century, when a celebrated foreign composer came out\r\npublicly and said: 'What Shakespeare did in dramatic poetry Moussorgsky\r\naccomplished in vocal music. The Shakespearian breadth and power of\r\nhis compositions are so original that he is still too great to be\r\nappreciated, even in this generation. A century may pass before he\r\nwill be fully understood by composers and music lovers generally. His\r\nmisfortune was that he composed music two hundred years ahead of his\r\ntime.' After this the whole atmosphere changed. A cult of Moussorgsky\r\nwas started at home and abroad. The public began to dig out the tragic\r\nchapters of his life little by little and the neglected genius of\r\nMoussorgsky loomed up to an extraordinary height, as is usually the\r\ncase when the sentiments of the public are stirred. However, this cult\r\nof Moussorgsky is merely a timely fad and adds nothing to his real\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nAfter the composer had met bitter opposition where he had expected\r\nenthusiastic appreciation he wrote to Balakireff: 'I do not consider\r\nmusic an abstract element of our æsthetic emotions, but a living art,\r\nwhich, going hand in hand with poetry and drama, shall express the very\r\nsoul of human life and feeling. The academic composers and the people\r\nwho have grown to love the musical classics take my works for eccentric\r\nand amateurish. This is all because I lack the high academic air and do\r\nnot follow the conventional way. But why should I imitate others when\r\nthere is so much within myself that is my own? My idea is that every\r\ntone should express a word. Music to me is speech without words.'\r\n\r\nMoussorgsky's music reminds us so much of the poetry of Walt Whitman\r\nthat we cannot but regard these two geniuses of two different worlds as\r\nintimately related to each other.\r\n\r\n    'Composers! mighty maestros!\r\n    And you sweet singers of old lands, Soprani, tenori, bassi!\r\n    To you a new bard caroling in the west\r\n    Obeissant sends his love.'\r\n\r\nLike Whitman, Moussorgsky broke loose from the conventional rhythm and\r\nverse. Most of his compositions are set to his own words and librettos,\r\nin a kind of poetic prose. He said plainly that he never cared for\r\nverse for his compositions, but merely for a dramatic story to carry a\r\ncertain thought. 'Thoughts and words fascinate me more than rhythm and\r\npoetic technique,' he used to say. Every piece of his work bears the\r\nstamp of his individuality; every chord of his music breathes power\r\nand inspiration. It was not a notion to be original that actuated him,\r\nbut the irresistible necessity to pour out what came to life in his\r\ncreative soul and temperament. In his autobiography Moussorgsky writes\r\ncharacteristically:\r\n\r\n'By virtue of his views and music and of the nature of his compositions\r\nMoussorgsky stands apart from all existing types of musicians. The\r\ncreed of his artistic faith is as follows: Art is a means of human\r\nintercourse and not in itself an end. The whole of his creative\r\nactivity was dictated by this guiding principle. Convinced that human\r\nspeech is strictly governed by musical laws, Moussorgsky considered\r\nthat the musical reproductions, not of isolated manifestations of\r\nsensibility, but of articulate humanity as a whole, is the function\r\nof his art. He holds that in the domain of the musical art reformers\r\nsuch as Palestrina, Bach, Berlioz, Gluck, Beethoven, and Liszt have\r\ncreated certain artistic laws; but he does not consider these laws\r\nas immutable, holding them to be strictly subject to conditions of\r\nevolution and progress no less than the whole world of thought.'\r\n\r\nMoussorgsky's life was no less unique than his thoughts and works. He\r\nwas born in 1831 in the village of Kareva in the province of Pskoff,\r\nthe son of a retired judicial functionary. He inherited the gift of\r\nmusic from his mother and from his father the gift of poetry. At the\r\nage of ten he was sent to a military school in St. Petersburg, where\r\nhe remained until 1856, when he became an officer of the Preobrajensky\r\nGuard Regiment in St. Petersburg. A handsome young man of chivalrous\r\nmanners, he became the romantic hero of the _beau monde_ of St.\r\nPetersburg. His musical studies, begun in the college, were taken up\r\nmore systematically and energetically after he became an officer. As\r\na sentinel in the military hospital he met Borodine, the surgeon, and\r\nthe two passionate lovers of music soon grew to be intimate friends. It\r\nwas through Borodine that he heard of Balakireff, in whose Free School\r\nof Music he at once became a student. Already in 1858 he composed his\r\nfirst orchestral work, 'Scherzo,' which was performed two years later\r\nby Balakireff's orchestra.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Moussorgsky resigned from the army with the idea of living for\r\nhis music alone, but, lacking a systematic musical education, he found\r\nhimself an outcast. He was treated as a dilettante by the professional\r\nmusicians and the patrons of music, and this closed the way to\r\nearning a living by his art and getting his compositions published or\r\nproduced. The situation made him desperate and he was glad to accept a\r\nclerkship, first in the Department of Finance, later in the office of\r\nthe Imperial Comptroller. The salary was small and the work hard; he\r\ncould only compose during the evenings and on festival days. This made\r\nhim bitter about his future. It is rather strange that even Balakireff\r\ndid not wholly understand Moussorgsky's genius when he joined the\r\ncircle, for Rimsky-Korsakoff writes in his memoirs that Moussorgsky\r\nwas always treated as the least talented of all. This was on account\r\nof the peculiarly passive frame of mind into which the composer had\r\nfallen after leaving the army. He even changed in his appearance and\r\nmanners. The once handsome, chivalrous young social hero was suddenly\r\ntransformed into a dreamy vagabond, who cared nothing for manners and\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nMoussorgsky's masterpieces are his three song cycles of about twenty\r\nnumbers each, his few orchestral compositions and his two operas,\r\n_Boris Godounoff_ and _Khovanshchina_. There is hardly a work by\r\nanother composer which has upon the listener such a ghastly, hypnotic\r\neffect as some of these works of Moussorgsky. Every chord of them is\r\nlike a gripping, invisible finger. His cycle of 'Death Dances,' of\r\nwhich _Trepak_ is the most popular, are knocks at the very gates of\r\ndeath, written in the weird rhythms of old Russian peasant dances. In\r\nthis work he makes the listener realize the indifference of nature to\r\nhuman fate. 'Snow fields in silence--so cold is the night! And the icy\r\nnorth wind is wailing, brokenly sobbing, as though a ghastly dirge.\r\nOver the graves it is chanting. Lo! O behold. Through the night a\r\nstrange pair approaches; death holds an old peasant in his clutches.'\r\nThus sings the composer in the epilogue. The starved peasant is frozen\r\nunder the snow. But then the sun shines warmer; spring comes into the\r\nland. The icy fields change into flourishing meadows, the lark soars\r\nto the sky and nature continues its everlasting alternate play as if\r\nindividual joys and sorrows never existed.\r\n\r\nThe descriptive power of Moussorgsky's vocal compositions is\r\nmarvellously realistic, and of this his songs of the second and third\r\nactive period of his life, such as 'Peasant Cradle Song,' 'Children\r\nSongs,' 'Serenade,' and _Polkovodets_, give the best illustration. In\r\nthe first named composition not only does he visualize the rocking of\r\nthe cradle, accompanied by a sweet melody, but he also draws, with a\r\nremarkable power, the interior of a peasant's hut, the mother bending\r\nwith tenderness over her child; her sigh and dreaming of his future;\r\nthe child's breathing and the ticking of a primitive old watch on the\r\nwall. One can almost see the details of an idyllic lonely Russian\r\nvillage. But Moussorgsky is not only powerful in his gloomy and\r\nmelancholy tone pictures, in which he depicts the hopeless situation\r\nof the Russian people in their struggle for freedom; he is also great\r\nin his humorous, gay songs. _Hopak_, _Pirushki_, _Po Griby_, and the\r\n'Children Songs' are full of exultant humor, naughtiness or joy. How\r\nwell he could make music a satire is proved by 'Classic,' 'Raek,' and\r\nothers, in which pedantic academicism is caricatured in ironic chords.\r\nMoussorgsky's musical activity may be divided into three periods:\r\nFirst, from 1858 until 1865, when, more or less under the influence\r\nof Dargomijsky, he composed 'Edip,' 'Saul,' _Salâmmbo_, 'Intermezzo,'\r\n'Prelude,' and 'Menuette'; second, from 1865 until 1875, when he was\r\nindependent and wrote the 'Death Dances,' 'Children Songs,' _Boris\r\nGodounoff_, _Khovanshchina_, etc.; and the third, during which he\r\ncomposed the 'Song of Mephisto.' The works of his second period are\r\noverwhelming in their elemental power and boldness of treatment. In\r\nthem he surpasses all Russian composers up to his time.\r\n\r\n_Boris Godounoff_, finished in 1870, was performed four years later\r\nin the Imperial Opera House. The libretto of this opera he took from\r\nthe poetic drama of Pushkin, but he changed it, eliminating much and\r\nadding new scenes here and there, so that as a whole it is his own\r\ncreation. In this work Moussorgsky went against the foreign classic\r\nopera in conception as well as in construction. It is a typically\r\nRussian musical drama, with all the richness of Slavic colors, true\r\nByzantine atmosphere and characters of the medieval ages. Based on\r\nRussian history of about the middle of the seventeenth century, when\r\nan adventurous regent ascends the throne and when the court is full of\r\nintrigues, its theme stands apart from all other operas. The music is\r\nmore or less, like many of Moussorgsky's songs, written in imitation\r\nof the old folk-songs, folk dances, ceremonial chants, and festival\r\ntunes. Foreign critics have considered the opera as a piece constructed\r\nof folk melodies. But this is not the case. There is not a single folk\r\nmelody in _Boris Godounoff_, every phrase is the original creation of\r\nMoussorgsky.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is nothing in the symphonic development of _Boris\r\nGodounoff_ which approaches the complexities of Wagnerian music drama,\r\nthe leading motives are quite definitely associated with the characters\r\nand emotions of the drama. Noteworthy features in the realm of musical\r\nsuggestion are those of the music accompanying the hallucinations of\r\nBoris, where Moussorgsky forsakes the conventional custom of employing\r\nthe heavy brass and reproduces the frenzy in musical terms by means of\r\ndownward chromatic passage played tremolo by strings--an effect which\r\nsucceeds because it has a far more direct appeal to the nerves of the\r\nlistener than the more abstract commentary of the German operatic\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nMoussorgsky's second opera, _Khovanshchina_, which was finished by\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff after the death of the composer, is in its subject and\r\nbroad style far superior to 'Boris,' especially because of its more\r\npowerful symbolism and exalted pathos. But the music, particularly in\r\nthe last unfinished acts, lacks the originality and grip of his early\r\nopera. If he had been able to work out this opera under more favorable\r\ncircumstances it would have caught more faithfully the psychology of a\r\nnation's life and history in a nutshell of music than anything written\r\nbefore or later for the stage. Moussorgsky also wrote a comic opera,\r\n'The Fair at Sorotchinsk,' which was partly orchestrated and finished\r\nby Sahnovsky and Liadoff and performed for the first time in the Spring\r\nof 1914.\r\n\r\nMoussorgsky's perpetual misery, overwork, and the thought that his\r\ncompositions would be hardly understood and recognized during his\r\nlifetime made him so gloomy and desperate that he drifted away from\r\nBalakireff's circle. For some time he lived at the country place of his\r\nbrother, and when he returned to St. Petersburg he tried to overcome\r\nthe haunting thoughts, but in vain. He began to avoid all society and\r\neverything conventional. In the meanwhile his _Boris Godounoff_ had\r\nbeen given with great success on the stage. Yet the academic circles\r\nwould not recognize him in spite of this public success. The man's\r\npride was touched and he felt unhappy about everything he had done.\r\nHis only contentment he found in playing his works for himself and in\r\nassociating with the common people in dram shops, which he visited\r\nwith dire results. Shunning every intelligent circle and society, he\r\ngrew melancholy, and his mental and physical health was seriously\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         Russian Nationalists:\r\n\r\n        Modest Moussorgsky           Mily Balakireff\r\n        Alexander Borodine      Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakoff\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Moussorgsky began to write an opera to the libretto of Gogol's\r\ndrama 'Marriage.' This, however, he never finished. He wrote quite\r\na number of powerful orchestral works of which his 'Intermezzo,'\r\n'Prelude,' and _Menuette Monstre_ are the most typical of all. Having\r\ncomposed several piano pieces and orchestral works with little\r\nsatisfaction to himself, he decided to devote himself only to vocal\r\nmusic. The period from 1865 to 1875 was the most productive part of his\r\nlife. During these ten years he composed his 'Hamlet' songs, ballads,\r\nromances, and operas, every one of which is more or less original and\r\nhypnotizing in its own way.\r\n\r\nMoussorgsky's letters to his brother throw a remarkable light on his\r\nunique nature and the change that took place in his mind in regard to\r\nhis social environment. They are partly ironic, bitter expressions upon\r\nmodern civilization and its wrong standards. Moussorgsky died in 1881\r\nin the Nicholaevsky Military Hospital at the age of forty-two and asked\r\nthe nurse that instead of a mass in church his 'Death Dance' be played\r\nfor him by a few of his admirers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nThe most widely known of the 'neo-Russian' group, outside of Russia,\r\nwas Nicholas Andreievich Rimsky-Korsakoff. This man, the most prolific\r\nand the most expert of the group, proved himself in some ways one\r\nof the supreme masters of modern music. His command over harmonic\r\ncolor-painting and his astonishing mastery over all details of modern\r\norchestration have made him a teacher to the composers of all nations.\r\n\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff was born March 18, 1844, at Tikvin in the department\r\nof Novgorod. On his father's estate he received all the advantages\r\nof a childhood in the open air, and of the best education available.\r\nFrom the four musicians who furnished music for the family dances he\r\nreceived his first initiation into the art of his later years. When\r\nhe was six he received his first piano lessons, and when he was nine\r\nhe was already composing pieces of his own. But it was in the family\r\ntradition that the sons should enter the navy, so when he was but\r\ntwelve years of age the boy went to the St. Petersburg Naval School\r\nand entered the long required course. He did not, however, give up\r\nhis music during this period; he worked hard at the piano and the\r\n'cello, also receiving lessons in composition from Kanillé. But music\r\nwas comparatively meaningless in his life until, in 1861, he met\r\nBalakireff, who had recently come to the capital to undertake the\r\nmusical spiritualization of his country. Under Balakireff he worked\r\nfor about a year, and during this time came into close contact with\r\nthe other members of the famous circle. The contact was profoundly\r\nstimulating. 'They aired their opinions and criticized the giants of\r\nthe past,' says Mrs. Newmarch,[13] 'with a frankness and freedom that\r\nwas probably very naïve, and certainly scandalized their academic\r\nelders. They adored Glinka; regarded Haydn and Mozart as old-fashioned;\r\nadmired Beethoven's latest quartets; thought Bach--of whom they could\r\nhave known little beyond the \"Well Tempered Clavier\"--a mathematician\r\nrather than a musician; they were enthusiastic over Berlioz, while,\r\nas yet, Liszt had not begun to influence them very greatly.' Of\r\nthese days the composer has written, 'I drank in all these ideas,\r\nalthough I really had no grounds for accepting them, for I had only\r\nheard fragments of many of the foreign works under discussion, and\r\nafterwards I retailed them to my comrades at the naval school who were\r\ninterested in music as being my own convictions.'[14]\r\n\r\nThen, while Rimsky-Korsakoff's technique was still being molded,\r\nwhile his ideals were unprecise and his appreciations fluid, he was\r\ncalled away on a long cruise on the ship _Almaz_--a cruise which was\r\nto last for three years and take him around the world. But with the\r\nhuge energy for which Russians are so notable, he decided to add music\r\nto his regular official duties. He arranged that he was to send to\r\nBalakireff from time to time the things he would write on shipboard,\r\nand was to receive extended criticisms in return, to be picked up at\r\nthe harbors at which his ship should stop. Thus he would maintain\r\nhis active pupilship. The work which he managed to accomplish on\r\nshipboard is astonishing. But Rimsky-Korsakoff was endowed with a\r\ncapacity for orderly and methodical work which enabled him in later\r\nlife to discharge all sorts of onerous artistic burdens and keep his\r\ncreative output undiminished in quantity. When he returned from the\r\ncruise in 1865 he brought with him his Symphony No. 1, in E minor,\r\nthe first symphony to be written by a Russian. It was performed\r\nunder Balakireff's direction at one of the concerts of the Free\r\nSchool of Music and made a favorable impression. For the next few\r\nyears the composer's life was chiefly centred in St. Petersburg, and\r\nhis association with the Balakireff group was once more resumed. In\r\nthis period, too, began his close friendship with Moussorgsky, which\r\ncontinued until the latter's death. After composing the first Russian\r\nsymphony he produced the first Russian symphonic poem in _Sadko_,\r\nopus 5, which revealed his marked power of musical narration and\r\nscene-painting. Directly he followed with the 'Fantasy on Serbian\r\nTunes,' opus 6, which gave the first signs of his later brilliancy in\r\norchestration. This work attracted the attention of Tschaikowsky, who\r\nbecame his ardent supporter and continued as a personal friend in spite\r\nof the fact that the ideals of the two composers were so disparate that\r\nclose association was impossible. In 1870 Rimsky-Korsakoff began his\r\nfirst opera, _Pskovitianka_ ('The Maid of Pskoff'), which was performed\r\nearly in 1873 and was well received. Soon afterwards he completed his\r\n'Second Symphony,' which is in reality rather a symphonic poem--the\r\n_Antar_, op. 9.\r\n\r\nThis may be taken as closing one period of his creative activity. He\r\nhad entered music with all the lively nationalistic ideals of the\r\nBalakireff group, and with its naïveté as to musical technique. Like\r\nhis associates, he had written chiefly in an intuitional fashion.\r\nBut in 1871 he accepted an invitation to teach at the St. Petersburg\r\nConservatory of Music. And he has recorded that in attempting to teach\r\nthe theory of music he became convinced that it was first necessary for\r\nhim to learn it. He became profoundly dissatisfied with his musical\r\nachievement and set out deliberately to acquire an exhaustive knowledge\r\nof musical technique by means of hard work. During one summer he wrote\r\ninnumerable exercises in counterpoint and sixty-four fugues, ten of\r\nwhich he sent to Tschaikowsky for inspection. From this severe period\r\nof self-tuition he emerged with a command of conventional musical\r\nmeans unsurpassed in Russia, but without any essential loss either to\r\nhis individuality or to his nationalism. By some, Rimsky-Korsakoff's\r\nrecognition of his need for further technical learning has been\r\naccepted as a recantation of his nationalistic principles. But it was\r\nnot this in reality, for his later operas are all drawn from national\r\nsources and the folk-song continues to occupy a prominent place among\r\nthem. The enthusiasm for classical learning may have changed his\r\nstandards somewhat; many critics feel that the revision to which he\r\nlater submitted the Moussorgsky opera scores reveals a pedantic cast of\r\nmind, a failure to appreciate the original genius of his friend. But,\r\non the other hand, his severe training gave him that fluent technique\r\nwhich enabled him to accomplish such a great amount of work on such a\r\nhigh plane of workmanship.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Rimsky-Korsakoff 'recanted' nothing. His ideals and\r\nhis fundamental musical method had been formed in his early youth.\r\nBalakireff's enthusiasm for folk-song never left him. The influence\r\nof the early ocean cruise was in his work to the end. Among all\r\nmusicians Rimsky-Korsakoff is perhaps the greatest describer of the\r\nsea. The effect of lonely days and nights out in the midst of the\r\nswelling ocean, at a time when his adolescent senses were still deeply\r\nimpressionable--this we can trace again and again in his later music.\r\n'What a thing to be thankful for is the naval profession!' he wrote\r\nin a letter to Cui during the first voyage.[15] 'How glorious, how\r\nagreeable, how elevating! Picture yourself sailing across the North\r\nSea. The sky is gray, murky, and colorless; the wind screeches through\r\nthe rigging; the ship pitches so that you can hardly keep your legs;\r\nyou are constantly besprinkled with spray and sometimes washed from\r\nhead to foot by a wave; you feel chilly and rather sick. Oh, a sailor's\r\nlife is really jolly!' We see here the effect of the out-of-door\r\nactivity on the young artist--that awakening of sensibilities to the\r\nexternal life of nature, rather than the introspection of the thinker\r\nwho spends his time solely in the study of his art. It was this voyage,\r\nsurely, that chiefly helped to make Rimsky-Korsakoff so objective in\r\nhis music. He loves to describe the form and color of nature rather\r\nthan the experiences of the soul. He paints for us the life of the\r\nsenses. We recall the young naval officer in the mighty swell of the\r\nocean in _Scheherezade_. We cannot doubt the effect of this early\r\ninfluence toward making Rimsky-Korsakoff the great story-teller of\r\nmodern music.\r\n\r\nHis later life was an extremely active one. He retained his position\r\nat the conservatory for many years, and numbered among his pupils some\r\nof the most talented composers in modern Russian music--among them\r\nLiadoff, Arensky, Ippolitoff-Ivanoff, Gretchaninoff, Tcherepnine, and\r\nStravinsky. He was an enthusiastic collector of national folk-tunes.\r\nHe revised, completed, arranged, or orchestrated many large works,\r\nincluding operas by Moussorgsky, Borodine, and Glinka. He served for\r\nmany years as conductor of the concerts of the Free School, succeeding\r\nBalakireff, and for a time was assistant director of the music at the\r\nImperial Chapel. A perquisite post as inspector of naval bands, given\r\nhim in 1873, enabled him to devote his time to music; for many years he\r\nremained officially a servant of the government. After 1889 and up to\r\nthe time of his death in 1908 he wrote twelve operas, and at one period\r\nwas looked to to provide one dramatic work each year for one or another\r\nof the great lyric theatres of Russia. Once or twice he was publicly\r\nat odds with officialdom, at one time going so far as to resign his\r\nprofessorship in the conservatory. But on the whole he was a figure of\r\nwhom Russia, both popular and official, was proud. His books on theory\r\nand orchestration have long been standard.\r\n\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff's works, in addition to the fifteen operas already\r\nmentioned, include three symphonies (one of them the _Antar_), a\r\n'Sinfonietta on Russian Themes,' several symphonic poems, including\r\nthe 'symphony' _Scheherezade_, the _Sadko_, and the 'Symphonic Tale'\r\nfounded on the prologue to Pushkin's 'Russlan and Ludmilla'; several\r\nlarge orchestral works, including the famous 'Spanish Caprice,' the\r\n'Fantasia on Serbian Themes,' and the 'Easter Overture'; a fine piano\r\nconcerto and a violin fantasia; some church music, a limited amount of\r\npiano music and many songs.\r\n\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff's operas are the staple of the Russian opera houses.\r\nThey are not works of such genius as those of Moussorgsky and Borodine,\r\nbut, taken together, they reveal a creative genius of a high order.\r\nIn general their style is lyric rather than declamatory, but in this\r\nrespect Rimsky-Korsakoff applied a wide variety of means to his\r\nspecial problems. Some, like his first, 'The Maid of Pskoff,' follow\r\nloosely the principles laid down by Dargomijsky in 'The Stone Guest,'\r\nin which the libretto is regarded as a spoken text to be followed\r\nwith great literalness by the music. Others, like _Snegourotchka_,\r\nare almost purely lyric in character. Yet another, 'Mozart and\r\nSalieri,' is written in the style of the eighteenth century. But\r\nin one way or another the national feeling is in all of them, and\r\nfolk-tunes are introduced freely with more or less literalness.\r\nThough Rimsky-Korsakoff could occasionally reach heights of emotional\r\nintensity (as in the last scene of 'The Maid of Pskoff'), his genius\r\nis more properly lyrical and picturesque. The songs and pictures of\r\n_Snegourotchka_ and _Sadko_, in which a huge variety of resource is\r\nbrought to achieve vividness and brilliancy of effect, are the work\r\nof a rich imagination. The melody is supple and varied, the harmony\r\nextremely expressive and colorful, but neither is so original as with\r\nMoussorgsky. The orchestration, however, never fails to be masterful in\r\nthe highest degree. This suits admirably the legendary and picturesque\r\nsubjects which Rimsky-Korsakoff invariably chose. With only one or two\r\nexceptions, his operas have held the stage steadily in Russia, and two\r\nor three of them have become familiar, by frequent performances, to\r\nforeign audiences.\r\n\r\nAmong Rimsky-Korsakoff's other works the 'Spanish Caprice' and the\r\n_Scheherezade_ symphony have become classics of the concert room.\r\nThe former is a virtuoso piece in brilliantly colored orchestration.\r\nThe other is one of the most successful musical stories ever told.\r\nIn these pieces he is working in his own field, that of national or\r\noriental color, made vivid by every device of the modern musician. When\r\nhe is composing in the more 'absolute' or classical forms, as in the\r\n'Belaieff Quartet,' or the piano concerto, his inspiration seems to\r\nwane. Mention should be made of the songs, which include some of the\r\nmost perfect in Russian literature, though in many the slender melody\r\nis weighted down by the richness of the accompaniment. Finally, we\r\nshould not forget Rimsky-Korsakoff's great service to Russian church\r\nmusic, which will be referred to later.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief outline we can see how great was the variety of his\r\nactivities. Very little that he did was undistinguished. When he was at\r\nhis best, in the exploitation of the resources of the modern orchestra,\r\nin painting natural scenery, the sea or the woods, in narrating a story\r\nof fairies or heroes, he was in the very front rank of composers of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with Moussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakoff was a conservative.\r\nHe inclined toward the sensuous and regular melody of Borodine, which\r\nwas always somewhat Italian. His harmony was far from revolutionary.\r\nHe can show us no pages like that wonderful page of Moussorgsky's,\r\nintroducing the Kremlin scene in _Boris Godounoff_, where the light\r\nof the rising sun is painted striking the towers of the ancient\r\nchurches--a page which has become historic in connection with modern\r\nFrench impressionism. On the whole, indeed, he seems rather timid\r\nabout venturing off the beaten path. His harmonic heterodoxies,\r\nwhere they occur, are introduced discreetly, obtaining their\r\neffect rather by their appropriateness than by their originality.\r\nNor was Rimsky-Korsakoff so instinctive a nationalist as either\r\nBalakireff or Moussorgsky. In a great quantity of his music we find\r\nnothing to mark it as Russian. But when we _listen_ to the music of\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff we feel that it is daring, novel, and exotic. The\r\nstriking difference between this music _seen_ and _heard_ is due\r\nchiefly to the orchestration, which so glitters with strange colors\r\nthat we forget how orthodox the musical writing generally is. By tone\r\ncoloring the composer gives it qualities of pictorial suggestiveness\r\nand Oriental strangeness which is quite lacking in the piano score.\r\nSometimes he even covers up musical poverty by his magnificent scoring;\r\nthe 'Spanish Rhapsody,' for instance, is a work of little inherent\r\noriginality, but is maintained on our concert programs because of its\r\ninexpressible brilliancy of orchestration. If, on the whole, we find\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff's music thin, we must give due credit to the style\r\nwhich enabled the composer to write a great quantity of music with easy\r\nfacility, while his taste kept him almost always above the level of\r\nbanality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last member of the nationalist group was César Cui,\r\nthe least distinctive and least important of the five. He occupied a\r\nsomewhat anomalous position in the movement. The son of a Frenchman,\r\nhe became an enthusiastic nationalist, being the first of Balakireff's\r\nimportant converts. As a teacher in the Government Engineering School\r\nin St. Petersburg he had little time for active composition, but\r\nexerted great energy in defending the nationalist group in the press\r\nand in pamphlets. In all Russia, with the single exception of Vladimir\r\nStassoff, there was no more vigorous and overbearing apologist of the\r\nRussian school of composition. Yet his own music is hardly tinged with\r\nRussian elements, being a compound of Schumann and of some of the\r\nmost superficial of the French composers, notably Auber. Though he was\r\nundoubtedly a musician of considerable learning and much talent, he has\r\nleft nothing of much creative vigor.\r\n\r\nHis father came to Russia with Napoleon's army, was wounded at\r\nSmolensk, and later became a teacher of French in a private school\r\nat Vilna, near Poland. Here, on January 18, 1835, César Antonovich\r\nCui was born. He received fairly good instruction in piano and violin\r\nin his early years, and at the age of fifteen was sent to the School\r\nof Military Engineering at St. Petersburg. Here, in a seven years'\r\ncourse, he distinguished himself so that he was made sub-professor in\r\nthe school, and later became a specialist in military fortifications.\r\n(The present czar was at one time his pupil.) All his life he gave\r\ndistinguished service in this capacity, and during the war that is\r\ngoing on at this writing, though he is past eighty years of age, he is\r\ntaking a prominent part in the military defense of Russia.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1856, when he was twenty-one years old, that he was\r\nintroduced to Balakireff. He immediately became fired with the latter's\r\nenthusiasm for a Russian school of music. But his first works show\r\nno signs of it. Some early piano pieces are written entirely in the\r\nstyle of Schumann, and his first dramatic work, an operetta called\r\n'The Mandarin's Son,' is a weak piece in the manner of Auber. His\r\nfirst important opera, 'The Prisoner of the Caucasus,' finished about\r\nthis time though not performed until twenty years later, shows some\r\noriginality and an attempt at local color. Early in the 'sixties Cui\r\nwas at work on his opera 'William Ratcliff,' which established his\r\nreputation. It was performed in the year 1869 at the Imperial Theatre,\r\nSt. Petersburg, and though coldly received at the time was revived\r\nwith considerable success many years later in Moscow. But Cui's chief\r\ninfluence on the music of his time was exerted through his newspaper\r\narticles, which stoutly championed the 'Big Five.' In these he showed\r\nhimself an able, but a somewhat dogmatic, commentator. He held his\r\nground successfully until the music of the new school had ceased to\r\ndepend on the written word for its prestige. His pamphlet, 'Music\r\nin Russia,' was the chief source of knowledge of Russian composers\r\nto the outside world for many years. Cui further helped the cause\r\namong foreign lands through the performances of his operas in Belgium\r\nand Paris. In fact, two of his later operas, 'The Filibusterer' and\r\n_M'selle Fifi_, were composed to French texts. The opera 'Angelo,'\r\nperformed in 1876 and in some ways his strongest work, was also drawn\r\nfrom a French source--a play by Victor Hugo. When we have mentioned\r\n'The Saracen,' founded upon a work of Dumas, and 'The Feast in Plague\r\nTime,' based on Pushkin, we have named all his works for the stage. In\r\nthese the dramatic element is always subordinate to the lyrical. The\r\nharmony, though often meticulous, is rarely strong or original, and in\r\ngeneral the style is thin and conventional. But Cui had a rich fund of\r\nmelody, and in a few scenes, as in the love episodes in 'The Saracen,'\r\nhe succeeded to a notable degree in the expression of emotion. But it\r\nis in Cui's songs and small pieces for violin and piano that he shows\r\nhis talent most markedly. Here his French feeling for nicety of form\r\nand delicacy of effect revealed itself at its best. We feel that the\r\npieces were written by some lesser Schumann, but we admire the taste\r\nand judgment displayed in their execution. Further, we must admire\r\nCui's confining himself to his own style of music. His enthusiasm for\r\nand appreciation of the neo-Russian composers is unquestionable, and\r\nhe might have produced much flamboyant nonsense in trying to make\r\ntheir style his own. As it is he has played an important part in the\r\ndevelopment of Russian music, and displayed abilities which are by no\r\nmeans to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Russian nationalists we should mention several\r\ncomposers of their generation who were not definitely allied with\r\nthem or with their school, but still demand mention in any history\r\nof Russian music. Edward Franzovitch Napravnik was born August 12,\r\n1839, in Bohemia, and moved to St. Petersburg in 1861. He had received\r\nhis musical education in his native country and in Paris, where he\r\nstudied organ and piano, and later taught. In St. Petersburg he took\r\ncharge of Prince Youssipoff's private orchestra, and thereafter became\r\nintimately associated with the musical life of his adoptive country\r\nand worked indefatigably for its improvement and independence. In 1863\r\nhe was appointed organist to the Imperial theatres, and assistant to\r\nthe conductor. At the time of the latter's illness in 1869 he was\r\nappointed conductor, and this post he held for nearly half a century.\r\nHe found Russian operatic life under the complete dominance of the\r\nItalian influence and made every effort to shift the centre of gravity\r\ntoward native work. His productions of Glinka's, Tschaikowsky's, and\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff's operas were notable. He was always distinctly\r\nhospitable to native work, and the subsequent triumph of Russian\r\nmusical expression was due in no small degree to his faith and energy.\r\nHe further built up the opera orchestra in St. Petersburg until it\r\nbecame one of the best in all Europe, and restored to the opera house\r\nits old brilliancy of performance. He was also an able and frequent\r\nconductor of orchestral concerts in the capital. His compositions,\r\nthough many and varied, show chiefly French and Wagnerian influence,\r\nand are not highly important. He has written four symphonies, among\r\nthem one with a program taken from Lermontov; several symphonic poems,\r\nof which 'The Orient' is most important; three string quartets and a\r\nquintet, two piano trios, a piano quartet, a sonata for violin and\r\npiano, two suites for 'cello and piano, a piano concerto; fantasias on\r\nRussian themes for piano and violin, all with orchestral accompaniment;\r\na suite for violin and numerous vocal and instrumental pieces in the\r\nsmaller forms.\r\n\r\nHis operas, though they were never very popular, are perhaps the\r\nmost important part of his work. The first, 'The Citizens of\r\nNijny-Novgorod,' was produced at the Imperial Opera House in 1868.\r\nIt is somewhat in the style of Glinka, but is generally thin and\r\nuninspired except in the choral parts, which make effective use of the\r\nold church modes. 'Harold,' produced in 1886, is more Wagnerian in\r\nform and dispenses with the effects which helped the former work to\r\nits popularity. _Doubrovsky_, produced in 1895, is Napravnik's most\r\npopular work; in it the lyric quality is again most prominent, and the\r\nparts are written with expert skill for the singers. His last opera,\r\n_Francesca da Rimini_, founded on Stephen Phillips' play, was first\r\npresented in 1902. It is musically the most able of his works, though\r\nhighly reminiscent of the later Wagner. The music of the love scenes is\r\ntouching and expressive. On the whole, we find Napravnik's influence on\r\nRussian music to be notable and salutary, and his original composition,\r\nthough not inspired, sincere and workmanlike.\r\n\r\nPaul Ivanovich Blaramberg (b. 1841), the son of a distinguished general\r\nof French extraction, came early under the influence of the Balakireff\r\ncircle. But a number of years spent in foreign countries impressed\r\nother influences on his style, so that his music vacillated from one\r\nmanner to another without striking any distinctive note. Blaramberg was\r\nlong active as a teacher of theory in the school of the Philharmonic\r\nSociety in Moscow. His works include a fantasia, 'The Dragon Flies,'\r\nfor solo, chorus, and orchestra; a musical sketch, 'On the Volga,'\r\nfor male chorus and orchestra; 'The Dying Gladiator,' a symphonic\r\npoem; a symphony in B minor; a sinfonietta; a number of songs; and\r\nfive operas. His first opera, 'The Mummers,' founded on a comedy by\r\nOstrovsky, is a mingling of many styles, from the dramatic declamation\r\nof Dargomijsky to the musical patter of opera buffa. 'The Roussalka\r\nMaiden' contains many pages of marked lyric beauty, and 'Mary of\r\nBurgundy' attains some musical force in the 'grand manner.' The last\r\nopera, 'The Wave,' contains a number of pleasing melodies and not a\r\nlittle effective 'oriental color.'\r\n\r\nJ. N. Melgounoff (1846-1893) was a theorist rather than a composer\r\nand had some part in the nationalistic movement through his close and\r\nscientific study of folk-songs at a time when the cult of folk-song was\r\nchiefly sentimental. A. Alpheraky (born 1846) was also a specialist\r\nin folk-song, particularly those of the Ukrane, where he was born.\r\nHe composed a number of songs, as well as piano pieces, in which the\r\nnational feeling is evident. N. V. Lissenko (born 1842) was the author\r\nof a number of operas popular in the Malo-Russian provinces. He was a\r\npupil of Rimsky-Korsakoff and set music to several texts drawn from\r\nGogol.\r\n\r\n                                                           I. N.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] It is rather interesting that, in spite of Balakireff's opposition to\r\nTschaikowsky's music, they remained good friends throughout their life.\r\nTschaikowsky even tried to follow Balakireff's method in his symphonic\r\npoem 'Fatum,' which he dedicated to his friend. As the composition did\r\nnot please Balakireff, though he performed it for the first time, Tschaikowsky\r\ndestroyed it later and it was never published or performed again.\r\nThis is what Balakireff wrote to Tschaikowsky after his attempt at modern\r\ncomposition: 'You are too little acquainted with modern music. You\r\nwill never learn freedom of form from the classic composers. They can\r\nonly give you what you already knew when you sat at the student's\r\nbenches.' As irritable as Tschaikowsky was in such critical matters, he\r\nnever took the expression of Balakireff in an offended spirit. How highly\r\nTschaikowsky appreciated Balakireff is evident from his letter to Mme.\r\nvon Meck: 'Balakireff's songs are actually little masterpieces and I am\r\npassionately fond of them. There was a time when I could not listen to\r\nhis \"Selim's Song\" without tears in my eyes.']\r\n\r\n[13] 'The Russian Opera.'\r\n\r\n[14] 'Reminiscences.'\r\n\r\n[15] Quoted by Mrs. Newmarch, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V\r\n                   THE MUSIC OF CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA\r\n\r\n    The border nationalists: Alexander Glazounoff, Liadoff,\r\n    Liapounoff, etc.--The renaissance of Russian church music:\r\n    Kastalsky and Gretchaninoff--The new eclectics: Arensky,\r\n    Taneieff, Ippolitoff-Ivanoff, Glière, Rachmaninoff and\r\n    others--Scriabine and the radical foreign influence; Igor\r\n    Stravinsky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe influence of the 'neo-Russian' group did not continue in any\r\ndirect line. There is to-day no one representing the tendency in all\r\nits purity. But there are a number of composers, originally pupils or\r\nsatellites of the Balakireff circle, who have carried something of\r\nthe nationalistic tendency into their style. Chief of these, perhaps,\r\nis Alexander Constantinovich Glazounoff, one of the most facile and\r\nbrilliant of contemporary Russian writers for the orchestra. His early\r\ncareer was brilliant in the extreme. He was born in St. Petersburg on\r\nAugust 10, 1865, of an old and well-known family of publishers. In his\r\nchildhood he received excellent musical education and showed precocious\r\ntalents. At the age of fifteen he attracted the notice and received\r\nthe advice of Balakireff, who urged further study, and two years later\r\nhis first symphony was performed at a concert of the Free School. In\r\nthe following year he entered the university, continuing the lessons\r\nhe had begun under Rimsky-Korsakoff. The first symphony attracted the\r\nattention of Liszt, who conducted it in 1884 at Weimar, and to whom a\r\nsecond symphony, finished in 1886, was dedicated. Smaller works written\r\nat this time show vivid pictorial and national tendencies. In 1889\r\nGlazounoff conducted a concert of Russian works, including his own,\r\nat the Paris exposition, and was honored by the performance of a new\r\nsymphonic poem of his--_Stenka Razin_--in Berlin. The following years\r\nbrought more narrative or pictorial works--the orchestral fantasias\r\n'The Forest' and 'The Sea,' the symphonic sketch 'A Slavonic Festival,'\r\nan 'Oriental Rhapsody,' a symphonic tableau, 'The Kremlin,' and the\r\nballet 'Raymonda.'\r\n\r\nThe last, which was finished in 1897, may be taken as marking the end\r\nof Glazounoff's period of youthful romanticism. His work thereafter\r\nwas less bound to story or picture, more self-contained and notable\r\nfor architectural development. There are seven symphonies already to\r\nbe recorded, together with a violin concerto of the utmost brilliancy,\r\nthough of classical design. Among the other works of the later period\r\nshould be mentioned the Symphonic Prologue 'In Memory of Gogol,' a\r\nFinnish fantasia, performed at Helsingfors in 1910; the symphonic\r\nsuite, 'The Middle Ages'; and another ballet, 'The Seasons.' There is\r\nalso not a little chamber music distinguished in form and execution,\r\nand a quantity of songs of facile and graceful quality. Glazounoff is\r\nnow director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory.\r\n\r\nObviously his early ideals were much influenced by Rimsky-Korsakoff\r\nand by Balakireff, from whom he gained his first distinguished\r\nencouragement. He responded to the romantic appeal of mediæval and\r\nnational fairy stories. He felt the grandeur of the sea and the poetry\r\nof heroic legends. Thus in _Stenka Razin_ he tells of the Cossack\r\nbrigand whose death was foretold by his captive Persian princess and\r\nwho sacrificed her in expiation of his sins to the river Volga. But\r\nit is evident that this romantic influence was not lasting. What he\r\nchiefly learned from Rimsky-Korsakoff was not the picturing of nature\r\nor of legendary beings, but the manipulation of the orchestra with the\r\nutmost of brilliancy. In his later works this becomes only technical\r\nvirtuosity, dazzling but somewhat empty. His travels in foreign lands\r\nimpressed foreign ideals upon him. When we have given due credit to his\r\nthoroughness of workmanship, his sensitive regard for form and balance,\r\nthe pregnant beauty of many of his themes, we still feel that he is\r\nonly a sublimated salon composer.\r\n\r\nAnatol Constantinovich Liadoff is another of Rimsky-Korsakoff's pupils\r\nwho has shown little enthusiasm for a distinctly nationalistic music.\r\nHe was born in St. Petersburg on April 29, 1855, of a musical family,\r\nboth his father and his uncle being members of the artistic staff of\r\nthe opera. He entered the violin class of the conservatory and was\r\nchosen for Rimsky-Korsakoff's class in composition. His graduation\r\ncantata was so fine that he was invited to become a teacher, and has\r\nremained with the institution ever since. In 1893 he was appointed with\r\nLiapounoff to undertake the collection of Russian folk-songs initiated\r\nby the Imperial Geographical Society. His genius has shown itself\r\nchiefly in the smaller forms, in which he has produced pieces for the\r\npiano distinguished for perfection of form. His songs, especially those\r\nfor children, have had a wide popularity. There are a certain number\r\nof genre pieces for the piano (e. g., 'In the Steppes,' opus 23) and\r\nnumerous pieces in the well known smaller forms, such as preludes,\r\nétudes, and dances. The symphonic scherzo, _Baba Yaga_, telling of the\r\npranks of an old witch of children's folk-lore, is one of his ablest\r\nworks. We should also mention the orchestral legend, entitled 'The\r\nEnchanted Lake,' opus 62; the 'Amazon's Dance,' opus 65; and the 'Last\r\nScene from Schiller's \"Bride of Messina,\"' opus 28, for mixed chorus\r\nand orchestra.\r\n\r\nSergei Mikhailovich Liapounoff was born on November 18, 1859, at\r\nYaroslav, and studied at the Imperial School of Music at Nijny-Novgorod\r\nand at the Moscow Conservatory. Later he came under the influence\r\nof Balakireff, who conducted the first performance of his 'Concert\r\nOverture.' For some years he was assistant conductor at the Imperial\r\nChapel at St. Petersburg. He is best known by his piano pieces, chiefly\r\nthe fine Concerto in E flat minor, and the tremendously difficult\r\nÉtudes. His numerous lighter pieces for piano, among which are the\r\n_Divertissements_, opus 35, have become exceedingly popular. His\r\nsongs show a strong national or oriental influence. His orchestral\r\ncompositions include a symphony, opus 12, the 'Solemn Overture on a\r\nRussian Theme,' opus 7, and a symphonic poem, opus 37. Mention should\r\nalso be made of his rhapsody on Ukranian airs for piano and orchestra,\r\nwhich is a further proof of his sensitive feeling for folk-song.\r\n\r\nVasili Sergeievich Kallinikoff, born in 1866 in the department of\r\nOrloff, was at the time of his death in 1900 one of the most promising\r\nof the then younger Russian composers. He studied for eight years in\r\nthe school of the Moscow Philharmonic Society, and upon his graduation\r\nbecame assistant conductor of the Moscow Private Opera. The oncoming\r\nof consumption, however, forced him to take up his residence in the\r\nCaucasus. His most extraordinary work was the first symphony, in\r\nthe key of G minor, which was finished in 1895 and went begging for\r\nperformance until it was given several years later in Kieff. Since\r\nthen it has figured as one of the most popular of Russian orchestral\r\nworks. The second symphony, in A major, is less distinguished. His\r\nother orchestral works, showing great talent and considerable national\r\nfeeling, include two 'symphonic scenes,' 'The Nymphs' and 'The Cedars,'\r\nand the incidental music to Alexander Tolstoy's play, 'Czar Boris,'\r\nwritten for its performance at the Moscow Art Theatre in 1899. There\r\nis also a cantata, _Ivan Damaskin_, and a ballad, _Roussalka_, for\r\nsolo, chorus and orchestra. Kallinikoff also left some songs, chamber\r\nmusic and piano pieces. A marked originality is revealed in his best\r\nwork, but it was still immature when his final illness put an end to\r\ncreative activity.\r\n\r\nA. Spendiaroff is loosely associated with the neo-nationalists and\r\nhas acquired some little popularity with his orchestral works, 'The\r\nThree Palms' and the 'Caucasian Sketches.' He shows a marked talent\r\nof a pictorial order, and felicity in the invention of expressive\r\nmelody. But his technique is that of an age past, his method rings\r\nalways true to the conventional, and his musical content sounds all too\r\nreminiscent. Ossip Ivanovich Wihtol, born in 1863 at Volnar, near the\r\nBaltic Sea, has gained a distinctive position for himself as a worker\r\nwith Lettish themes. He was educated at the St. Petersburg Conservatory\r\nand studied composition under Rimsky-Korsakoff. Until 1908 he was a\r\nteacher of theory in this institution. His best works are those which\r\nare connected with Lettish folk-music, notably the Symphonic Tableau,\r\nopus 4; the Orchestral Suite, opus 29; and the Fantasia for violin,\r\nopus 42. We should also mention the 'Dramatic Overture' and the\r\n_Spriditis_ overture, the piano sonata, a string quartet, and a number\r\nof songs and choruses--some _a cappella_ and some with orchestral\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nWe have spoken several times of the absence of a true 'national\r\nschool' of Russian composition in present times. But this statement\r\nmust be amended. There is one school which represents in great purity\r\nthe cult of the national and has achieved notable results in its\r\nwork. This is the school of musicians who have undertaken to build\r\nup a pure ritual music for the Russian church. This group is purely\r\nnational in character. It is the most intense contemporary expression\r\nof the 'Slavophile' ideal in recent times. The neo-Russian group of\r\nBalakireff was, it is true, only loosely connected with the Slavophile\r\nor nationalistic political movement of its time, but its relation to\r\nthe 'Western' tendency of Tschaikowsky and Rubinstein is analogous\r\nwith that of the novelist Dostoievsky to Turgenieff. The renaissance\r\nof Russian church music probably has a certain political significance,\r\nfor church and state have been traditionally close to one another\r\nin the land of the czar. The Eastern church, like that of Rome,\r\nsuffered from the musical sentimentalism of the nineteenth century\r\nand received a vast accretion of 'sacred' music which was flowery,\r\nthin, and utterly unsacred in spirit. And like the Roman church it\r\nmade strenuous efforts to effect a reform, choosing as its basis the\r\ntraditional ecclesiastical modes. These, in the Eastern church, are\r\nas rich and impressive as the Gregorian modes of Rome. The first\r\ndefinite step was the establishment, in 1889, of the Synodical School\r\nof Church Singing in Moscow, under the direction of C. V. Smolenski.\r\nIt was only a preparatory step, for, under the advice of Tschaikowsky\r\nand Taneieff, it concentrated first upon the education of a number of\r\nsingers thoroughly grounded in musical art and theory. In 1898 the\r\nschool was enlarged and reformed, becoming a regular academy with a\r\nnine-year course and offering a thorough training in every branch\r\nof musical art, from sight reading up to composition. New methods\r\nof teaching, introduced in 1897, brought the choral work up to an\r\nunprecedented pitch of excellence, and a visit of the school choir to\r\nVienna in 1899 left a profound impression upon the outside world. The\r\nschool instituted, in addition to its regular theoretical studies, a\r\ncourse in the history of church music and its use in contrapuntal\r\nforms, and thus began the training of its own line of church composers,\r\nof whom the most able is to-day P. G. Chesnikoff. V. C. Orloff, who\r\nnotably raised the standard of singing in the Metropolitan choir in\r\nSt. Petersburg, is now director of the school, and with the help of\r\nthe choral director, A. D. Kastalsky, has brought it to astonishing\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nKastalsky and Gretchaninoff have attained their eminence as composers\r\nchiefly through their work in the renaissance of church music. The\r\nformer was born in 1856, received a regular preparatory school course,\r\nand studied music in the Moscow Conservatory. In 1887 he became\r\nteacher of piano at the Synodical school, and later of theory. He\r\nhas composed much for the ritual, basing his work on the old church\r\nmelodies and developing a style which is personal, yet in the highest\r\ndegree religious and impressive. His position in Russian ecclesiastical\r\nmusic is now supreme. But in praising his work we should not forget to\r\nmention that of his predecessors, who did much to preserve a decent\r\nappropriateness for Russian church music in the dark days. Following\r\nthe great Bortniansky came G. F. Lyvovsky (1830-1894), who was educated\r\nin the imperial choir and was later director of the Metropolitan choir\r\nin St. Petersburg. He was a man of much talent, and, feeling the\r\napproach of the new attitude toward sacred music, showed in his work\r\nthe transition from the old to the new. Other notable church composers,\r\nboth in the old and the new style, were A. A. Archangelsky (born 1846),\r\nTaneieff, Arensky, and Rimsky-Korsakoff.\r\n\r\nBut Gretchaninoff, though he has by no means given himself solely to\r\nthe composition of sacred music, has brought the greatest genius to\r\nbear on it. He is no mere routineer and theorist. Some of his works for\r\nthe ritual will stand as among the most perfect specimens of sacred\r\nmusic the world over. Combined with the greatest simplicity of method\r\nis an exhaustive technical knowledge and a poetical feeling for the\r\nnoble and profound. It is he who has put into tones the supreme poetry\r\nof worship. The profound impressiveness of this new sacred music in\r\nperformance is in part due to the traditional Eastern practice of\r\nsinging the ritual unaccompanied. This _a cappella_ tradition has\r\ndisciplined a generation of choirs to an accuracy of intonation which\r\nis impossible where singers can depend upon the support of an organ.\r\nFurther, there is the marvellous Russian bass voice, sometimes going\r\nas low as B-flat or A, which furnishes a 'pedal' support to the choir\r\nand makes an accompanying instrument quite superfluous. The newer\r\nchurch composers have not been slow in taking advantage of the striking\r\nmusical opportunities offered by this peculiar Slavic voice. As a\r\nresult of all these influences, the musical renaissance of the Eastern\r\nchurch has been far more successful than the parallel awakening in\r\nthe Roman, and has produced a music and a tradition of church singing\r\nincomparable in the world to-day for nobility and purity.\r\n\r\nAlexander Tikhonovich Gretchaninoff was born on October 13, 1864, in\r\nMoscow, studied piano in the Moscow conservatory and went in 1890 to\r\nSt. Petersburg to enjoy the advantages of Rimsky-Korsakoff's teaching.\r\nHe early gained a prize with a string quartet, and became known in\r\nforeign countries by his songs and chamber music. His style, outside\r\nof his church music, is not especially national. He is inclined to\r\nthe lyrical, preferring Borodine to Moussorgsky, and throughout his\r\nsecular work shows German influence. His symphony in G minor, op. 6,\r\ngained for him general recognition in Russia, and the symphony op.\r\n27 justified the great hope felt for his talent. Gretchaninoff has\r\nbeen active in dramatic music. He has written incidental music to\r\nOstrovsky's 'The Snow Maiden' and to two of the plays which go to form\r\nAlexander Tolstoy's trilogy on the times of Boris Godounoff. His two\r\noperas, _Dobrinya Nikitich_ and 'Sister Beatrice,' are distinguished by\r\ngreat melodic impressiveness and in general by a lyrical style which\r\nderives from Rimsky-Korsakoff and Borodine. The latter opera, founded\r\non Maeterlinck's play, met with disfavor at the hands of the Russian\r\nclergy, because of its representation of the Virgin on the stage, and\r\nwas withdrawn after four performances.\r\n\r\nA number of minor composers may also be grouped under the general head\r\nof nationalists. Most prominent of these is Nikolai Alexandrovich\r\nSokoloff, who was born in St. Petersburg in 1859 and studied\r\ncomposition in the St. Petersburg Conservatory under Rimsky-Korsakoff.\r\nHis chamber music comprises three quartets, a string quintet,\r\nand a serenade. For orchestra he has written incidental music to\r\nShakespeare's 'A Winter's Tale' for performance at the Alexandrinsky\r\nTheatre in St. Petersburg; a dramatic poem after Tolstoy's 'Don Juan';\r\na ballet, 'The Wild Swans'; and an elegy and serenade for strings.\r\nThere are numerous small pieces for piano and violin, and choruses both\r\nfor mixed voices and for men's voices alone. A. Amani (1875-1904) was\r\nalso a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakoff and in his piano and chamber music\r\ntook for his inspiration the poetry of the Orient and the melody of\r\nfolk-song. F. Blumenfeld (born 1863) has distinguished himself as\r\nconductor at the Imperial Opera, St. Petersburg, and has written,\r\nbesides the 'Allegro Concerto' for piano and orchestra and the symphony\r\nin C, many songs and smaller piano pieces which place him with the\r\nnewer 'nationalists.' A. A. Iljinsky (born 1859) has composed an opera\r\non Pushkin's 'Fountain of the Baktchisserai,' a symphonic scherzo,\r\nand an overture to Tolstoy's _Tsar Feodor_, besides much chamber and\r\npiano music. G. A. Kazachenko (born 1858) has written an opera, 'Prince\r\nSerebreny,' which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1892, and is\r\nnow chorus-master at the Imperial Opera. A. Kopyloff (born 1854) has\r\nwritten much orchestral music, including a symphony in C major, a\r\nscherzo for orchestra, and a concert overture, also chamber music,\r\nincluding an effective quartet in G major, op. 15. N. V. Stcherbacheff\r\n(born 1853) is associated with the younger nationalists and has\r\ncomposed much for piano and voice, in addition to a serenade and two\r\n'Idylls' for orchestra. Finally, B. Zolotareff has distinguished\r\nhimself in chamber music and in song-writing, and has shown great\r\nability in his _Fête Villageoise_, op. 24, his 'Hebrew Rhapsody,' op.\r\n7, and his Symphony, op. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nWe now come to a group of composers who have been little influenced by\r\nthe Russian folk-song. They all trace their artistic paternity in one\r\nway or another to Tschaikowsky. They are men who have used their native\r\ntalent in a scholarly and sincere way, and have attained to great\r\npopularity in their native land and even outside of it, but they seem\r\nlikely not to retain this popularity long. (This judgment may, however,\r\nbe premature in the case of Glière.) It is not, of course, their denial\r\nof nationalism which has placed them in the second class. But their\r\nloyalty to the past does not seem to be coupled with a sufficiently\r\npowerful creative faculty to make secure their hold upon the public.\r\n\r\nAnton Stephanovich Arensky was one of the most popular composers in\r\nRussia. This reputation was gained in part by his piano pieces, which\r\nmade rather too great an effort toward the superficially pleasing\r\nand have now almost passed out of sight. His ambitious operas, too,\r\nhave failed to hold the stage, but his chamber music shows him at his\r\nbest. He was the son of a physician and was born at Nijny-Novgorod\r\non July 31, 1861. His early evinced musical talent was carefully\r\nnurtured in his home, and when he was still young he was sent to St.\r\nPetersburg to study under Zikke. Later he worked under Rimsky-Korsakoff\r\nat the Conservatory, and gained that institution's gold medal for\r\ncomposition. His first symphony and his piano concerto were both given\r\npublic performance soon after his graduation in 1882, and Arensky\r\nwas appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the Moscow\r\nConservatory. In 1888 he became conductor of the concerts of the\r\nRussian Choral Society in Moscow, and in 1895 moved to St. Petersburg\r\nto accept the position of director of the Imperial Chapel choir, to\r\nwhich he had been appointed on the recommendation of Balakireff. He\r\ndied in 1906 and it was generally felt that the death had prevented the\r\ncomposition of what would have been his best works. Early in his career\r\nhe gained the active sympathy and encouragement of Tschaikowsky, who\r\ninfluenced him strongly in a personal way. His talent was essentially\r\nconservative, and his scholarly cast of mind is shown in his published\r\n'method,' which he illustrated with 1,000 musical examples, and in his\r\nbook on musical forms.\r\n\r\nHis best works date from the Moscow period, since bad health decreased\r\nhis creative vigor in his later years. Some of his smaller works may\r\nbe placed beside the best of Tschaikowsky. Most popular outside of\r\nRussia have been the two string quartets, his trio in D minor, and his\r\npiano quintet in D major, op. 51. Of his two symphonies, the first,\r\nwritten in his boyhood, is quite the best. The piano fantasia on\r\nRussian themes, the violin concerto, and the cantata, 'The Fountain of\r\nBaktchissarai,' are among his best known works. His first opera, 'The\r\nDream on the River Volga,' was written to a libretto which Tschaikowsky\r\nhad abandoned and passed on to him 'with his blessing.' He aimed at\r\ndramatic force and truthfulness, but his talent was essentially\r\nlyrical, and he proved to be at his best in his clear and graceful\r\nariosos. His later operas, 'Raphael' and 'Nal and Damayanti' (each in\r\none act), show an advance in musical power, though the method still\r\ncontinues conservative. Arensky's ballet, 'A Night in Egypt,' was\r\nproduced in 1899. His last work, composed on his deathbed, was the\r\nincidental music composed for the performance of 'The Tempest' at the\r\nMoscow Art Theatre. Some of these numbers are among the best things he\r\never wrote.\r\n\r\nSergei Ivanovich Taneieff is a conservative both in mind and in heart,\r\nand may be considered the only real pupil of Tschaikowsky. He was born\r\nof a rich and noble family in Vladimir on November 13, 1856, and at the\r\nage of ten entered the then newly opened Moscow Conservatory, where\r\nhe studied the piano under Nicholas Rubinstein. Under Tschaikowsky he\r\nworked at theory and composition. In 1875 he graduated with highest\r\nhonors and with a gold medal for his playing, which was characterized\r\nby purity and strength of touch, grace and ease of execution,\r\nmaturity of intellect, self-control, and a calm objective style of\r\ninterpretation. These qualities may well be considered typical of his\r\ncompositions. After a long Russian tour with Auer, the violinist,\r\nTaneieff succeeded Tschaikowsky as professor of orchestration at the\r\nMoscow Conservatory. In 1885 he became director of the institution, but\r\nsoon retired to devote himself wholly to composition. Though he is an\r\nadmirable pianist, he seldom appears in public.\r\n\r\nHis compositions, though not numerous, are all marked by sincerity\r\nand thoroughness of workmanship. Some of them have been compared to\r\nthose of Brahms. His work is essentially that of a scholar, and makes\r\nlittle appeal to the emotions. His mastery, of form is marked. The most\r\nambitious of his works is the 'trilogy' (in reality a three-act opera)\r\nbased on the Æschylus 'Oresteia.' This, though never popular in Russia\r\nbecause of its severity of style, compels admiration for its nobleness\r\nof concept and its scholarly execution. The overture and last entr'acte\r\nare still frequently performed in Russia. In general the style is\r\nWagnerian, and the leit-motif is used freely, though not to excess.\r\nA cantata for solo, chorus, and orchestra--the _Ivan Damaskin_--is\r\none of the finest works of its kind in Russian music. Taneieff has\r\nalso written three symphonies and an overture on Russian themes. But\r\nhis most distinctive work is perhaps to be found in his eight string\r\nquartets (of which the third is the most popular), in his two string\r\nquintets, and his quartet with piano. There are also a number of male\r\nchoruses and smaller piano works.\r\n\r\nA much more likable, though no less conservative, figure is Michael\r\nMikhaelovich Ippolitoff-Ivanoff. He was born of a working class family\r\nnear St. Petersburg on November 15, 1859, and managed to get to the\r\nSt. Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied for six years under\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff. In 1882 he went to Tiflis, where he remained a number\r\nof years as director of the local music school, as conductor of the\r\nconcerts of the Imperial Musical Society, and for a time as director\r\nof the government theatre. In 1893 he came to Moscow to teach harmony,\r\ninstrumentation and free composition at the Conservatory, to the\r\ndirectorship of which he succeeded in 1906. But perhaps his greatest\r\ninfluence on Russian musical life was exerted by him in his position\r\nas director of the Moscow Private Opera, which he assumed in 1899,\r\nand which he helped to build up to its high artistic standard. His\r\nreputation in foreign lands rests chiefly on his string quartet, opus\r\n13, and his orchestral suite, 'Caucasian Sketches,' opus 10. (A second\r\nCaucasian suite appeared in 1906 and has had much success.) The list\r\nof his works also includes notably a Sinfonietta and a piano quartet;\r\nthree cantatas; _Iberia_, for orchestra; and the 'Armenian Rhapsody,'\r\nop. 48. In many of these works, as in his songs, he is frequently\r\ndisplaying his penchant for Oriental, Hebrew, and Caucasian music,\r\nwhich he has studied with a poet's love and appreciation. In his two\r\noperas, 'Ruth' and 'Assya,' these qualities are also apparent. The\r\nnotable qualities of his music are its freedom from artificiality, its\r\nwarmth of expression, and its consistent thoroughness of workmanship.\r\nBut it is perhaps as an organizer and director that he has performed\r\nhis chief service to Russian music.\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising of the younger conservative Russians is\r\nReinhold Glière, who is now director of the Conservatory at Kieff\r\nand conductor of the Kieff Symphony concerts. He has in these\r\npositions been a dominant factor in the provincial, as opposed to\r\nthe metropolitan, musical life of Russia, and has by his energy and\r\nprogressiveness raised Kieff to a position in some ways rivalling the\r\ncapital. He was born at Kieff on January 11, 1875, and was educated at\r\nMoscow, where he studied with Taneieff and Ippolitoff-Ivanoff. Though\r\nhe was thus under conservative influences, he showed in his earliest\r\ncompositions a feeling for the national musical sources which forbade\r\ncritics to classify him as a cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nHis first string quartet, in A (op. 2), showed national material\r\ntreated with something of western softness, and his many small pieces\r\nfor string or wind instruments often make use of folk-like melodies.\r\nIt is in his piano pieces that he shows himself weakest, and these\r\nhave contributed to an under-appreciation of him in his own as well\r\nas in foreign lands. Some of his works (especially the later ones)\r\nare thoroughly national in character. Thus his recently finished\r\nopera 'Awakened' is built entirely on folk-material, and comes with\r\nrevolutionary directness straight from the heart of the people. His\r\nsymphonic poem, 'The Sirens,' showed French influence, but was\r\nhardly a successful synthesis. His first symphony, in E flat, op.\r\n8, revealed great promise, and his string quartets have drawn the\r\nattention of music-lovers in foreign lands.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                    Contemporary Russian Composers:\r\n\r\n            Alexander Glazounoff      Reinhold Glière\r\n             Vladimir Rebikoff      Sergei Rachmaninoff\r\n\r\nIt is in his symphonic work that Glière shows his greatest ability. His\r\norchestral writing burns with the heat that is traditional in Russian\r\nmusic, and his handling of his themes, in development and contrapuntal\r\ntreatment, is sometimes masterly. By far his greatest work is his third\r\nsymphony, _Ilia Mourometz_, which is in reality a long and extremely\r\nambitious symphonic poem. It tells the tale of the great hero, Ilia,\r\nof the Novgorod cycle of legends, who sat motionless in his chair for\r\nthirty years until some holy pilgrims came and urged him to arise and\r\nbecome a hero. Then he went forth, conquering giants and pagans, until\r\nhe was finally turned to stone in the Holy Mountains. In this work the\r\nthemes, most of which are national in character, and some of which seem\r\ntaken directly from the people, are in the highest degree pregnant\r\nand expressive. They are used cyclically in all four movements, and\r\nare developed at great length and with great complexity. The harmonic\r\nidiom is chromatic, not exactly radical but yet personal and creative.\r\nIf we except certain _cliché_ passages which are unworthy of so fine a\r\nwork, we must adjudge the symphony from beginning to end a masterpiece.\r\nSomething of this mastery of the heroic mood is also to be seen in\r\nGlière's numerous songs. Though most of them are conventional in their\r\nharmonic scheme, they reveal great poetry and expressive power. With\r\nbut one exception Glière seems to be the greatest of the conservatives\r\nof modern Russia.\r\n\r\nThis exception is Sergei Vassilievich Rachmaninoff, whose reputation,\r\nnow extended to all parts of the civilized world, is by no means beyond\r\nhis deserts. He was born on March 20, 1873, in the department of\r\nNovgorod, of a landed family of prominence. At the age of nine he went\r\nto St. Petersburg to study music, but three years later transferred\r\nto Moscow, where he worked under Taneieff and Arensky. He graduated\r\nfrom the Moscow Conservatory in 1892 with high honors, and his one-act\r\nopera, _Aleko_, written for graduation, was promptly performed at the\r\nGrand Theatre and made a deep impression. Two short periods of his\r\nlater life were spent in the conducting of opera in Moscow, but the\r\nmost of his time he has spent in composition. He is a pianist of rare\r\nabilities, and has played his own music much on tours. For some years\r\nhe resided in Dresden.\r\n\r\nRachmaninoff's early fame is due to the sensational popularity of his\r\nC-sharp minor prelude for piano, a fine work of heroic import, holding\r\nimmense promise for the future. While much of his later composition\r\nhas been somewhat conventional in style, Rachmaninoff at his best has\r\njustified the promise. The magnificent E minor symphony ranks among the\r\nbest works of its kind in all modern music. Scarcely inferior to it\r\nis the symphonic poem, 'The Island of the Dead,' suggested by Arnold\r\nBöcklin's picture. Two later operas have proved very impressive. The\r\nfirst, 'The Covetous Knight,' is founded on a tale of Pushkin, and\r\nfollows the complete original text with literal exactness, achieving\r\nan impressive dramatic declamation which seems always on the verge of\r\nmelody, and entwines itself with the masterly psychological music of\r\nthe orchestra. _Francesca da Rimini_ is more lyrical, and shows much\r\npassion and power in its love scenes.\r\n\r\nRachmaninoff's only chamber music is an 'elegiac trio' in memory of\r\nTschaikowsky and a couple of sonatas. A large choral work, 'Spring,'\r\nhas attained great popularity in Russia, and a recent one, founded\r\non Edgar Allan Poe's poem, 'The Bells,' is said to reveal abilities\r\nof the highest order. For piano there are many pieces--notably the\r\nvarious groups of preludes, some hardly inferior to the famous one in\r\nC-sharp minor; a set of variations on a theme of Chopin; six pieces\r\nfor four hands, op. 11; two suites for two pianos, op. 5 and op. 17;\r\nand two superb concertos for piano and orchestra, of which the second,\r\nop. 18, is the more popular. His minor piano pieces are among the most\r\nvigorous and finely executed in modern piano literature. His songs are\r\nof wide variety, especially in regard to national feeling; in some,\r\nas, for instance, 'The Harvest Fields,' he is almost on a plane with\r\nMoussorgsky. We should mention also two works for orchestra, a 'Gypsy\r\nCaprice' and a fantasia, 'The Cliff.'\r\n\r\nRachmaninoff's music is justly to be called conservative and even\r\nacademic in its later phase. But this must not be taken to imply\r\nthat it is cold or unpoetic. No modern Russian composer can better\r\nstrike the tone of high and heroic poetry. Rachmaninoff has taken the\r\ntechnique of the West, especially of modern Germany, and the spirit\r\nif not the letter of the tunes of his own lands and fused them into a\r\nmusic of his own, which, at once complex and direct, stirs the heart\r\nand inflames the blood. His orchestral palette is powerful and inclined\r\nto be heavy. His contrapuntal style is complex and masterful. His\r\nmelody is free and impressive. He is by all odds the greatest of the\r\nmodern Russian eclectics.\r\n\r\nA number of other composers, loosely connected with the 'Western'\r\ntradition of Tschaikowsky, should here be mentioned. Some of these\r\nare young men who may as yet have given no adequate evidence of\r\ntheir real ability. But all of them are able musicians with some\r\nsolid achievement to their credit. A. N. Korestschenko (born 1870)\r\nwon the gold medal at the Moscow Conservatory for piano and theory\r\nafter studying under Taneieff and Arensky, and is now professor of\r\nharmony at that institution. His most important work includes three\r\noperas, a ballet 'The Magic Mirror,' and a number of orchestral works,\r\nnotably the 'Lyric Symphony,' a 'Festival Prologue,' the Georgian and\r\nArmenian Songs with orchestra, and the usual proportion of songs and\r\npiano pieces. Nicholas Nikolaevich Tcherepnine was born in 1873 and\r\nstudied for the law, but changed to the St. Petersburg Conservatory,\r\nwhere he energetically studied composition under Rimsky-Korsakoff. His\r\nstyle is eclectic and flexible. His name is best known through his\r\ntwo ballets, _Narcisse_ and _Le Pavilon d'Armide_, but his overture\r\nto Rostand's _Princesse Lointaine_, his 'Dramatic Fantasia,' op. 17,\r\nand his orchestral sketch from 'Macbeth,' give further evidence of\r\nmarked powers. His songs and duets have had great popularity, and his\r\npianoforte concerto is frequently played. He has also been active as a\r\ncomposer of choral music, accompanied and _a cappella_.\r\n\r\nMaximilian Steinberg, born in 1883 and trained under Rimsky-Korsakoff\r\nand Glazounoff, has worked chiefly in an academic way and has shown\r\nmarked technical mastery, especially in his quartet, op. 5, and\r\nhis second symphony in B minor. Nicholas Medtner, who is of German\r\nparentage, shows the same respect for classical procedure, together\r\nwith an abundance of inspiration and enthusiasm. He was born in\r\nMoscow on December 24, 1879, and carried off the gold medal at the\r\nConservatory in 1900. Since then he has been active chiefly as a\r\ncomposer, and has to his credit a number of very fine piano sonatas,\r\nas well as considerable chamber music. Attention has recently been\r\nattracted to his songs, which combine great technical resource with\r\na fresh poetical feeling for the texts. There is nothing of the\r\nnationalistic about his work. The same, however, cannot quite be\r\nsaid for George Catoire (born Moscow, 1861), who, though educated in\r\nBerlin, has shown a feeling for things Slavic in his symphonic poem,\r\n_Mzyri_, and in his cantata, _Russalka_. Among his other large works\r\nare a symphony in C minor, a piano concerto, and considerable chamber\r\nmusic. J. Krysjanowsky is another modern eclectic, known chiefly by his\r\nsonata for piano and violin, which, though able, shows little poetical\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nLet us complete this section of the history with a passing mention\r\nof certain minor composers of local importance. A. von Borchmann has\r\nshown a solid musical ability and a strong classical tendency in his\r\nstring quartet, op. 3. J. I. Bleichmann (1868-1909) was the composer\r\nof many popular piano and violin pieces, of an orchestral work,\r\nseveral sonatas, and a sacred choral work, 'Sebastian the Martyr.' A.\r\nGoedicke has composed two symphonies, a dramatic overture, a piano\r\ntrio, a sonata for piano and violin and another for piano alone, and\r\nnumerous smaller pieces. W. Malichevsky is an able composer of great\r\npromise and has written three symphonies, three quartets and a violin\r\nsonata. M. Ostroglazoff is an 'eclectic' whose true powers are as\r\nyet undetermined. W. Pogojeff is fairly well known because of his\r\nable chamber music and piano pieces. S. Prokofieff (born 1891) is an\r\nable and classically minded pupil of Glière and Liadoff, and Selinoff\r\n(born 1875) has carried his early German training into the writing of\r\nsymphonic poems. We should also make mention of E. Esposito, an able\r\nand charming composer of operetta.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nOf radical Russian composers two have in recent years become\r\ninternationally famous. Alexander Scriabine is notable for his highly\r\ndeveloped harmonic method, which makes sensible subjective states of\r\nemotion hardly possible to music hitherto. And Igor Stravinsky has in\r\nhis ballets carried free counterpoint and a resultant revolutionary\r\nharmony to an extreme almost undreamed of in the whole world of\r\nmusic. How much there is of mere sensation in these two musicians is\r\nat this time hard to determine. The question will be determined in\r\npart not only by the extent to which they retain a hold over their\r\naudiences, but also by the extent to which the new paths which they\r\nare opening prove fruitful to later followers. If one may judge by\r\nappearances at this writing, it would seem that Scriabine, who was\r\nessentially a theorist and a mystic, had little to give the world\r\nbeyond a reworking of the chromatic style of Wagner's 'Tristan'--a\r\nstyle seemingly inadequate to the intimate subjective message he would\r\nhave it bear. Stravinsky, on the other hand, though still crude, seems\r\nto be at the threshold of a new and remarkable musical development. In\r\naddition to these new men we find in Russia a number who may justly\r\nbe called radicals, being influenced by the radicals of other lands,\r\nchiefly France. No creative ability of the first order has as yet been\r\ndiscovered among these minor men.\r\n\r\nAlexander Scriabine was born in Moscow on December 25, 1871. He was\r\ndestined by his family for a career in the army, but his leaning toward\r\nmusic determined him to quit the cadet corps and become a student\r\nin the Moscow Conservatory. Here he studied piano with Safonoff and\r\ncomposition with Taneieff. He graduated in 1892, taking a gold medal\r\nand setting out to conquer Europe as a concert performer. In 1898 he\r\nreturned to the Moscow Conservatory to teach, but in 1903 resigned,\r\ndetermining to devote all his time to composition. Since then he has\r\nlived in Paris, Budapest, Berlin, and Switzerland. In 1906-07 he made\r\na brief visit to the United States, appearing as a pianist. He died,\r\ndreaming great dreams for the future, in 1915. His compositions have\r\nbeen numerous and have shown a steady advance from the melodious and\r\nconventional style of his early piano works to the intense harmonic\r\nsensualism of his later orchestral pieces. The first piano works were\r\ncharacterized by Cui as 'stolen from Chopin's trousseau.' This is\r\nnot unjust, although the works show a certain technical originality\r\nin the invention of figures. The first symphony is written in solid\r\nand conservative style, with a due element of Wagnerian influence,\r\nand a choral finale in praise of art speaking for its composer's good\r\nintentions. The second symphony shows a development of technical\r\nskill and an enlarging of emotional range, but gives few hints of the\r\nlater style. The smaller music of this period--as, for instance, the\r\nMazurkas, op. 25, the Fantasia, and the Preludes, op. 35--also show\r\nprogress chiefly on the technical side. The 'Satanic Poem' for piano,\r\nop. 34, points to Liszt as its source.\r\n\r\nIt is the third symphony in C, entitled 'The Divine Poem,' which\r\nfirst gives distinct evidence of change. This work, composed in 1905,\r\nundertakes to depict the inner struggles of the artist in his process\r\nof creation, and reveals the subjective trend of its composer's\r\ngrowing imagination. Its three movements are entitled respectively,\r\n'Struggles,' 'Sensual Pleasures,' and 'Divine Activity.' Here the\r\nemotional element is well to the fore. The first movement is stirring\r\nand dramatic, the second languorous and rich, the third bold and\r\nbrilliant. The orchestra employed is large and the technique complex.\r\nOther ambitious works of the earlier period are the concerto in F-sharp\r\nminor, op. 20, a work of no outstanding importance, and the 'Reverie'\r\nfor orchestra, op. 24, which is distinctly weak. But by the time we\r\nhave reached the 'Poem of Ecstasy,' composed in 1908, we have the\r\ncomposer in all his long-sought individuality. The harmonic system is\r\nvague to the ear, and weighs terribly on the senses. There is evidence\r\nof some esoteric striving. One feels that 'more is meant than meets\r\nthe ear.' It is in a single movement, but in three sections, and these\r\nare entitled, respectively, 'His Soul in the Orgy of Love,' 'The\r\nRealization of a Fantastic Dream,' and 'The Glory of His Own Art.'\r\nThe orchestration is rich in the extreme and the development of the\r\nmotives shows a mature musical power. The effect on the nerves and\r\nsenses is undeniably powerful. But withal it remains vague as a work of\r\nart; it is obviously meant to convey an impression, but the definite\r\nimpression, like the 'program,' is withheld, and perhaps it is as well\r\nso.\r\n\r\nBut it is the 'Prometheus,' subtitled 'Poem of Fire' (composed 1911,\r\nop. 60), which shows Scriabine at his most ambitious. The work is\r\nwritten in the general style of the 'Poem of Ecstasy,' but the style,\r\nlike the themes, is more highly developed. And there is super-added\r\nthe color-symbolism which has helped to give the work something of\r\nits sensational fame. The music is meant to tell of the coming of\r\n'fire'--that is, of the creative principle--to man, and the orchestra\r\ndescribes (one might better say 'experiences') the various forces\r\nbearing upon incomplete man (represented by the piano, which serves as\r\na member of the orchestral body), until the creative principle comes\r\nand makes complete him who accepts it. But in addition to the _tones_\r\nScriabine has devised a parallel manipulation of _colors_, on a color\r\nmachine partly of his own invention, and has 'scored' the 'chords'\r\nas he imagines them to suit the music. 'The light keyboard,' says a\r\ncommentator, 'traverses one octave with all the chromatic intervals,\r\nand each key projects electrically a given color. These are used in\r\ncombination, and a \"part\" for this instrument stands at the head of the\r\nscore. The arrangement of colors is as follows: C, red; G, rosy-orange;\r\nD, yellow; A, green; E and B, pearly blue and the shimmer of moonshine;\r\nF sharp, bright blue; D-flat, violet; A-flat, purple; E-flat and\r\nB-flat, steely with the glint of metal; F, dark red.' The first\r\nperformance of the work, with the color machine used as the composer\r\nplanned, was that of the Russian Symphony Orchestra of New York, in\r\nMarch, 1915. It can hardly be said that the experiment was convincing\r\nto many in the audience, but it seems altogether possible that some\r\nsort of union of the arts of pure color and pure tone in an expressive\r\nmission may be fruitful for the future.\r\n\r\nIn a posthumous work entitled 'Mystery,' Scriabine intended to use\r\nevery means possible, including perfume and the dance, to produce a\r\nsupreme emotional effect on the audience. We should also mention the\r\nten piano sonatas, of which the seventh and ninth are the best, which\r\nshow their composer's musical development with great completeness, but\r\nsuffer in the later examples from a harmonic monotony. This seemed to\r\nbe Scriabine's besetting sin. It seems doubtful whether his harmonic\r\nmethod, as he developed it, is flexible enough for the continued strain\r\nto which he put it. For in truth it is not a daring or extremely\r\noriginal system, however impressive it may sound in the commentator's\r\nnotes. If we may sum the matter up in a slang phrase we might say that\r\nScriabine's harmony 'listens' better than it sounds.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the French 'impressionists' on Russian composers is\r\nrepresented at its best in the work of such men as Vassilenko and\r\nRebikoff. The Russians have ever been citizens of the world and have\r\nbeen quick to imitate and learn from their western neighbors. But\r\nin the past century they have also been quick to assimilate and to\r\ngive back something new from their own individuality. This may be the\r\ndestined course of the French influence on Slavic musicians.\r\n\r\nSergius Vassilenko was born in Moscow in 1872, entered the Conservatory\r\nin 1896, and was awarded the gold medal for a cantata written after\r\nfive years' work under Taneieff and Ippolitoff-Ivanoff. His early\r\nwork was much under the influence of the Russian nationalists, and\r\nhis epic poem for orchestra, op. 4, illustrates a taste for mediæval\r\npoetry which he supported out of his profound knowledge of modal and\r\nchurch music. But his larger works after this were chiefly French in\r\nstyle. These include the two 'poems' for bass voice and orchestra, 'The\r\nWhirlpool' and 'The Widow'; a symphonic poem, 'The Garden of Death,'\r\nbased on Oscar Wilde, and the orchestral suite _Au Soleil_, by which he\r\nis chiefly known in foreign lands.\r\n\r\nFeodor Akimenko, though less wholly French in his manner, may be ranked\r\namong those who chiefly speak of Paris in their music. He was born at\r\nKharkoff on February 8, 1876, was educated in the Imperial Chapel in\r\nSt. Petersburg, and later was instructed in one or another branch of\r\nmusic by Liadoff, Balakireff, and Rimsky-Korsakoff. The influence of\r\nthese masters is evident in his work, however much he may have absorbed\r\na French idiom. His is 'a fundamentally Slavonic personality,' says one\r\ncommentator,[16] 'which inclines toward dreaminess more than toward\r\nsensuality or the picturesque. His music resembles the French only\r\nin suppleness of rhythms and elaborateness of harmonies.' His early\r\nworks, which are more thoroughly Russian in method, include many songs\r\nand piano pieces, three choruses for mixed voices, a 'lyric poem' for\r\norchestra, a string trio and a piano and violin sonata. After his\r\njourney to Paris his style changed notably. From this later period\r\nwe may mention such works for the piano as the _Recits d'une âme\r\nrêveuse_, _Uranie_, _Pages d'une poésie fantastique_, etc. His latest\r\ncompositions include a _Sonata Fantastique_ and an opera, 'The Queen of\r\nthe Alps.'\r\n\r\nAnother composer of much originality and of subjective tendencies\r\nis Vladimir Rebikoff, who was born on May 16, 1866, at Krasnoyarsk,\r\nin Siberia. Even in his piano pieces he has attempted to mirror\r\npsychological states. But this attempt is carried much further in his\r\noperas. 'The Christmas Tree,' in one act, attempts to contrast the\r\nfeelings of the rich and the poor, and it was successful enough in\r\nits artistic purpose to gain much popularity with its Moscow public.\r\nRebikoff has written two other 'psychological' operas--'Thea,' op. 34,\r\nand 'The Woman and the Dagger,' op. 41--not to mention his early 'The\r\nStorm,' produced in 1894. In his 'melo-mimics,' or pantomimic scenes\r\nwith closely allied musical accompaniment, Rebikoff has created a small\r\nart form all his own.\r\n\r\nM. Gniessin is one of the most talented of the younger Russians\r\nwho have shown marked foreign influence--in this case German. His\r\nimportant works include a 'Symphonic Fragment' after Shelley, op. 4; a\r\nSonata-ballad in C-sharp minor for piano and 'cello, op. 7; a symphonic\r\npoem, _Vrubel_; and a number of admirable songs. W. G. Karatigin is\r\nknown as the editor of Moussorgsky's posthumous works and composer of\r\nsome carefully developed music. Among the remaining young composers of\r\nthis group we need only mention the names of Kousmin, Yanowsky, Olenin\r\nand Tchesnikoff.\r\n\r\nThere remains Igor Stravinsky, perhaps the greatest of all the\r\nyounger Russian composers in the pregnancy of his musical style. He\r\nis regarded as a true representative of nationalism in its 'second\r\nstage,' for, though his work bears little external resemblance to\r\nthat of Moussorgsky, for instance, its style is indigenous to Russia\r\nand its thematic material is closely connected with the Russian\r\nfolk-song. Stravinsky was born at Oranienbaum on June 5, 1882, the son\r\nof Feodor Stravinsky, a celebrated singer of the Imperial Theatre in\r\nSt. Petersburg. Though his precocious talent for music was recognized\r\nand was fostered in piano lessons under Rubinstein, he received a\r\nclassical education and was destined for the law. It was not until\r\nhe met Rimsky-Korsakoff at Heidelberg in 1902--that is, at the age\r\nof twenty--that he turned definitely and finally to music. He began\r\nwork with Rimsky-Korsakoff and learned something about brilliancy in\r\norchestration. But his ideals were too radical always to suit his\r\nmaster. The latter is said to have exclaimed on hearing his pupil play\r\n'The Fire Bird': 'Stop playing that horrible stuff or I shall begin to\r\nlike it.'\r\n\r\nStravinsky's first important work was his symphony in E-flat major,\r\ncomposed in 1906, and still in manuscript. Then came 'Faun and\r\nShepherdess,' a suite for voice and piano, and, in 1908, the _Scherzo\r\nFantastique_ for orchestra. His elegy on the death of Rimsky-Korsakoff,\r\nhis four piano studies, and a few of his songs, written about this\r\ntime, hold a hint of the changed style that was to come.\r\n\r\nHere begins the list of Stravinsky's important compositions.\r\n'Fireworks,' for orchestra, was written purely as a technical _tour de\r\nforce_. Music in the higher sense it is not, but it reveals immense\r\ntechnical resource in scoring and in the invention of suggestive\r\ndevices. Pin wheels, sky rockets and exploding bombs among other things\r\nare 'pictured' in this orchestral riot of tone. In 1909 came the ballet\r\n'The Nightingale,' which has recently been rewritten, partly in the\r\ncomposer's later style, and arranged as an opera. This led him to his\r\nfirst successful ballet. But before entering considering the three\r\nworks which have chiefly brought him his fame let us refer to some of\r\nthe later songs, e. g., 'The Cloister' and 'The Song of the Dew,' which\r\nare masterful pieces in the ultra-modern manner, and to the 'Astral\r\nCantata,' which has not yet been published at this writing.\r\n\r\nStravinsky's fame in foreign lands (which is doubtless almost equal\r\nto that in his own, a strange thing in Russian music) rests almost\r\nentirely on the three ballets which were mounted and danced by\r\nDiaghileff's company of dancers, drawn largely from the Imperial Opera\r\nHouse, in St. Petersburg, who for several seasons made wonderfully\r\nsuccessful tours in the European capitals. It must be understood that\r\nthis institution, the so-called 'Russian ballet,' was in no wise\r\nofficial. It represented the 'extreme left wing' of Russian art in\r\nregard to music, dancing, and scene painting. It was altogether too\r\nradical to be received hospitably in the official opera house. But it\r\nproved to be one of the most brilliant artistic achievements of recent\r\ntimes, and on it floated the fame of Igor Stravinsky.\r\n\r\nHis first ballet, 'The Fire Bird,' was produced in Paris in 1910. It\r\ntells a long and richly colored story of the rescue of a beautiful\r\nmaiden from the snares of a wicked magician. The music is by no\r\nmeans 'radical,' but it shows immense talent in expressive melody,\r\ncolorful harmony, in precise expression of mood, in the suggestion of\r\npictures, and in a certain elaborate and free polyphony which is one\r\nof Stravinsky's chief glories. It is a work irresistible alike to the\r\ncasual listener and to the technical musician. The next ballet was\r\n'Petrouchka,' produced in 1911. This is a fanciful tale of Petrouchka,\r\nthe Russian Pierrot, and his unhappy love for another doll. The little\r\nman finds a rival in a terrible blackamoor, and in the end is most\r\nfoully murdered, spilling 'his vital sawdust' upon the toy-shop floor.\r\nThe characters are richly varied, and the carnival music is telling\r\nin the extreme. Stravinsky's musical characterization and picturing\r\nhere is masterly. But his greatest achievement is his preservation of\r\nthe tone of burlesque throughout--bouncing and joyous, yet kindly and\r\nrefined.\r\n\r\nIn this work we notice much of the harmonic daring which is so\r\nstartling in his third ballet, 'The Consecration of Spring.' Here is\r\nan elaborate dance in two scenes, setting forth presumably the mystic\r\nrites by which the pre-historic Slavic peoples lured spring, with its\r\nfruitful blessings, into their midst. The character of the music and\r\nof the libretto is determined by the peculiar theory of the dance\r\non which the ballet is founded. We cannot here go into this matter.\r\nSuffice it to say that the dancing does not pretend to be 'primitive'\r\nin an ethnological sense, though its angular movements continually\r\nrecall the crudities of pre-historic art. The music is quite terrifying\r\nat first hearing. But a second hearing, or a hasty examination of the\r\nscore, will convince one that it is executed with profound musicianship\r\nand a sure understanding of the effects to be obtained. Briefly, we may\r\ndescribe the musical style as a free use of telling themes, largely\r\nnational in character, contrapuntally combined with such freedom\r\nthat harmony, in the classical sense, quite ceases to exist. Because\r\nof the musical mastership displayed in the writing we can be sure\r\nthat this is not a 'freak' or a blind alley experiment. Whether the\r\ntendency represents a complete denial of harmonic relations, with the\r\nattention centred wholly on the polyphonic interweaving, or whether it\r\nis preparing the way for a new harmony in which the second (major or\r\nminor) will be regarded as a consonant interval, we cannot at this time\r\nsay. But Stravinsky's well-proved ability, and his evident knowledge of\r\nwhat he is about, are at least presumptive evidence that our enjoyment\r\nof this new style will increase with our understanding of it.\r\n\r\nCertainly men like Scriabine and Stravinsky prove that Russian music\r\nhas not been a mere burst of genius, destined to become embalmed in\r\nacademicism or wafted on lyrical breezes into the salons. Probably no\r\nnation in Europe to-day possesses a greater number of thoroughly able\r\ncomposers than Russia. The Slav seems to be no whit behind his brothers\r\neither in poetic inspiration or in technical progress. Perhaps it is a\r\nnew generation, that has just begun its work--a generation destined to\r\nachievements as fine as those of the glorious 'Big Five.'\r\n\r\n                                                         H.

As Louis XIV said that he was the\r\nstate, so it may almost be said that, musically speaking, these two men\r\nare Bohemia. And yet, paradoxical as it may seem, they can be really\r\nunderstood only when studied in relation to their national background,\r\nwhen considered the spokesmen of an otherwise voiceless but richly\r\nendowed race. This is the paradox, indeed, of all so-called 'national'\r\ncomposers. From one point of view they are personally unimportant;\r\ntheir eloquence is that of the race that speaks through them; and we\r\nlisten to them less as men of a general humanity than as a special\r\nsort of men from a particular spot of earth. Thus Mr. W. H. Hadow, in\r\nhis admirable essay on Dvořák,[17] does not hesitate to say of the\r\neighteenth century Bohemian musicians, Mysliveczek, Reicha, and Dussek,\r\nall of whom lived abroad: 'We may find in their denial of their country\r\na conclusive reason for their ultimate failure.' Shift the standpoint\r\na little, however, and it is obvious that something more is necessary\r\nfor a Bohemian musician than to live at home and to incorporate the\r\nnational melodies, or even express the national temperament, in his\r\ncompositions. He must, that is, have gone to school to the best masters\r\nof the music of the whole world--not literally, of course, but by\r\nstudy of their works; he must thus have become a past master of his\r\ncraft; above all, he must be a great individual, whatever his country,\r\na man of broad sympathy, warm heart, and keen intelligence. 'Theme,'\r\nwrote one who realized this on the occasion of Dvořák's death,[18] 'is\r\nnot the main thing in any art; the part that counts is the manner of\r\nhandling the theme. When books are good enough they are literature,\r\nand when music is good enough it is music. Whether it be \"national\" or\r\nnot matters not a jot.' Both of the truths that oppose each other to\r\nform this paradox are repeatedly exemplified in the history of music in\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\nThe Czechs, or Bohemians, like other Slavic peoples, are extremely\r\ngifted in music by nature; but, while their cousins, the Russians,\r\nexemplify this gift largely in songs of a melancholy cast, they are,\r\non the contrary, gay and sociable, and rejoice above all in dancing.\r\nThey are said to have no less than forty native dances. Of these the\r\nmost famous is the polka, improvised in 1830 by a Bohemian farm girl,\r\nand quickly disseminated over the whole world. The wild 'furiant'\r\nand the meditative poetic 'dumka' have been happily used by Smetana,\r\nDvořák, and others. Still other dances bear such unpronounceable names\r\nas the _beseda_, the _dudik_, the _hulan_, the _kozak_, the _sedlák_,\r\nthe _trinozka_. They are accompanied by the national instrument, the\r\n'dudy,' a sort of bagpipe. 'On the whole,' says Mr. Waldo S. Pratt,[19]\r\n'Bohemian ... music shows a fondness for noisy and hilarious forms\r\nwhose origin is in ardent social merrymaking, or for somewhat grandiose\r\nand sumptuous effects, such as imply a half-barbaric notion of\r\nsplendor. In these respects the eastern music stands in contrast with\r\nthe much more personal and subjective musical poesy to which northern\r\ncomposers have tended.' This characterization, it is interesting to\r\nnote, would apply as well to the music of Smetana and Dvořák, in\r\nwhich the kind of thoughtfulness we find in Schumann is almost always\r\nwanting, as to the folk-music of their country.\r\n\r\nThe songs, if naturally less boisterous than the dances, are animated,\r\nforthright, and cheerful, rather than profound. They are usually in\r\nmajor rather than in minor, and vigorous though graceful in rhythm. As\r\nin the spoken language the accent is almost always put on the first\r\nword or syllable, the music usually begins, too, with an accented\r\nnote. Another peculiarity that may be traceable to the language is\r\nthat the phrases are very apt to have an uneven number of accents,\r\nsuch as three or five, instead of the two or four to which we are\r\naccustomed. This gives them, for our ears, an indescribable piquant\r\ncharm. On the other hand, as Bohemia is the most western of Slav\r\ncountries, and consequently the nearest to the seats of musical culture\r\nin Germany, its songs show in the regularity of their structure and\r\nsometimes in considerably extended development of the musical thought,\r\na superiority over those of more remote and inaccessible lands. Music\r\nhas been taught, too, for many generations in the Bohemian schools as\r\ncarefully as 'the three R's,' and it is usual for the village school\r\nteachers to act also as organists, choir- and bandmasters. The Bohemian\r\ncommon people seem really to love music. It has been truly said: 'If a\r\nBohemian school of music can now be said to exist, it is as much due to\r\nthe peasant as to the conscious efforts of Bendl, Smetana, Fibich, A.\r\nStradal, and Dvořák.'[20]\r\n\r\nAs in Poland, Russia, Italy, and other countries, however, music\r\nsuffered long in Bohemia from political oppressions and from lack\r\nof leadership. In the seventeenth century, after the Thirty Years'\r\nWar, Bohemia, in spite of her proud past, found herself enslaved,\r\nintellectually as well as politically. Her music was overlaid and\r\nsmothered by fashions imported from Germany, France, and Italy, and her\r\ngifted musicians, as Mr. Hadow points out, emigrated thither. During\r\nthe eighteenth century her Germanization was almost complete, and\r\neven the Czech language seemed in danger of dying out. George Benda\r\n(1721-1795) wrote fourteen operas for the German stage; Anton Reicha\r\n(1770-1836) settled in Paris as a teacher; J. L. Dussek (1761-1812),\r\nbest known of all, was a cosmopolitan musician, more German than Czech.\r\n\r\nThen, early in the nineteenth century, began a gradual reassertion,\r\ntimid and halting at first, of the national individuality. Kalliwoda,\r\nKittl, Dionys Weber, and others tried to restore the prestige of the\r\nfolk-songs; Tomášek founded instrumental works upon them; Skroup\r\nmade in 1826 a collection of them. This Frantisek Skroup (1801-1862)\r\ndeserves as much as any single musician to be considered the pioneer\r\nof the Czech renaissanace. Conductor of the Bohemian Theatre at\r\nPrague, he composed the first typically national operas, performed\r\nin 1825 and later, and the most universally loved of Bohemian songs,\r\n'Where is My Home?' His life spans the whole period of gestation\r\nof the movement, for it was in 1862, the year of his death, that\r\nit reached tangible fruition in the founding of the national opera\r\nhouse, the 'Interimstheater,' at Prague. Two years before this, in\r\nOctober, 1860, the gift of political liberty had been granted Bohemia\r\nby Austrian imperial diploma. In May, 1861, Smetana, most gifted of\r\nnative musicians, had returned from a long sojourn in Sweden. Thus the\r\nnational music now found itself for the first time with an abiding\r\nplace, liberty, and a great leader.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Smetana, born at Leitomischl, Bohemia, March 2, 1824, showed\r\npronounced musical talent from the first, and was highly successful\r\nas a boy pianist. His father, however, averse to his becoming a\r\nprofessional musician, refused to support him when in his nineteenth\r\nyear he went to Prague to study. The severe struggle with poverty\r\nand even hunger which he had at this time, together with his close\r\napplication to the theory of music, may have had something to do with\r\nthe nervous and mental troubles which later overtook him. His need of\r\nstudy was great, for his musical experience had hitherto been chiefly\r\nof the national dances and other popular pieces. In 1848, looking over\r\na manuscript composition of six years before, he noted on its title\r\npage that it had been 'written in the utter darkness of mental musical\r\neducation,' and was preserved as 'a curiosity of natural composition'\r\nonly at the request of 'the owner'--that is, his friend Katharina\r\nKolář, who in 1849 became his wife. He settled for a time in Prague as\r\na teacher, and even opened a school of his own; but musical conditions\r\nin Bohemia were at that time so primitive that in 1857 he accepted\r\nan appointment as director of a choral and orchestral society at\r\nGothenburg in Sweden.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence abroad he composed, in addition to many piano\r\npieces and small works, three symphonic poems in which are to be found\r\nmuch of the spontaneity and buoyancy of thought and the brilliancy of\r\norchestral coloring of his later works of this type. These are 'Richard\r\nIII' (1858), 'Wallensteins Lager' (1859), and 'Hakon Jarl' (1861).\r\nNevertheless he had not yet really found his place. In 1859 his wife\r\ndied, and the following year he married Barbara Ferdinandi, a Bohemian.\r\nIt was partly due to her homesickness, partly to the projected erection\r\nof the Interimstheater, that he decided to return to Prague in 1861.\r\nHe was then nearly forty, but his lifework was still ahead of him. He\r\nentered with enthusiasm into the national movement. He established with\r\nFerdinand Heller a music school, through which he secured an ample\r\nliving. He was one of the founders of a singing society, and also of\r\na general society for the development of Bohemian arts. Above all, he\r\nbegan the long series of operas written for the new national opera\r\nhouse with 'The Brandenbergers in Bohemia,' composed in 1863, and 'The\r\nBartered Bride' (1866). Later came _Dalibor_ (1868), _Libusa_, composed\r\nin 1872 but not performed until 1881, _Die beiden Witwen_ (1873-74),\r\n_Der Kuss_ (1876), _Das Geheimnis_ (1878), and _Die Teufelsmauer_\r\n(1882).\r\n\r\nThe most famous of Smetana's operas, 'The Bartered Bride,' performed\r\nfor the first time at Prague, in 1866, became only gradually known\r\noutside Bohemia, but is now a favorite all over the world. It is a\r\nstory of village life, full of intrigue, love, and drollery. To this\r\nspirited and amusing story Smetana has set equally amusing and spirited\r\nmusic. From the whirling violin figures of the overture to the final\r\nchord the good humor remains unquenchable. In the polka closing Act\r\nI and the furiant opening Act II is village merriment of the most\r\ncontagious kind; in the march of the showman and his troupe, in the\r\nthird act, orchestrated for drums, cymbals, trumpet, and piccolo, is\r\nhumor of the broadest; and in Wenzel's stammering song, opening the\r\nsame act, is characterization of a more subtle kind, in which humor and\r\nreal feeling are blended as only a master can blend them. There are,\r\ntoo, many passages of simple tenderness, notably Marie's air and the\r\nduet of the lovers in the first scene, and their terzet with Kezal\r\nin the last, in which is revealed the composer's unfailing fund of\r\nlyrical melody. 'This opera,' says Mr. Philip Hale,[21] 'was a step\r\nin a new direction, for it united the richness of melody, as seen in\r\nMozart's operas, with a new and modern comprehension of the purpose\r\nof operatic composition, the accuracy of characterization, the wish\r\nto be realistic.' We may note, furthermore, how free is this realism\r\nof Smetana's from the brutality of some more modern operas on similar\r\nsubjects, such as those of Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and Puccini. The\r\nvillage life depicted in 'The Bartered Bride' is never repulsive; it is\r\nnot even tragic; it is simply pathetic, comic, and endlessly appealing.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the musical idiom is notable. Not only does the\r\ncomposer incorporate folk-tunes bodily when it suits his purpose,\r\nas in the case of the polka and furiant already mentioned, but the\r\nmelodies he invents himself are often equally simple, even naïve, and\r\nharmonized with a similar artlessness. The haunting refrain of the\r\nlove duet might be sung by village serenaders. Yet this simplicity is\r\nthe simplicity of distinction, not that of commonplaceness. There is a\r\npurity, a chivalric tenderness about it that can never be counterfeited\r\nby mediocrity, and that is in many of Smetana's tunes, as it is in\r\nSchubert's and in Mozart's. It is a very cheap form of snobbism that\r\ncriticises such art as this for its lack of the complexities of the\r\nGerman music-drama or symphony. Smetana himself said: 'As Wagner\r\nwrites, we cannot compose'--he might have added 'and would not.' 'To\r\nus,' says Mr. Hadow, speaking of the Bohemian composers in general, 'to\r\nus, who look upon Prague from the standpoints of Dresden or Vienna, the\r\nmusic of these men may seem unduly artless and immature: with Wagner on\r\nthe one side, with Brahms on the other, we have little time to bestow\r\non tentative efforts and incomplete production. Some day we shall learn\r\nthat we are in error. The \"Bartered Bride\" is an achievement that would\r\ndo credit to any nation in Europe.'\r\n\r\nOne effect of the great success of his opera was that Smetana was\r\nappointed conductor of the opera house. A few years later, in 1873,\r\nhe also became director of the opera school connected with it, and\r\none of the two conductors of the concerts of the Philharmonic Society\r\nat Prague. All these promising new activities, however, were suddenly\r\narrested by a terrible affliction, perhaps the worst that can happen to\r\na musician--deafness. On the score of the _Vyšehrad_, composed in 1874,\r\nthe first of the series of six symphonic poems which bears the general\r\ntitle 'My Country' and constitutes his masterpiece in pure orchestral\r\nmusic, is the note, 'In a condition of ear-suffering.' The second,\r\n_Vltava_, composed later in the same year, bears the inscription, 'In\r\ncomplete deafness.' It was indeed in 1874 that he was obliged to give\r\nup all conducting. Part of a letter which he wrote some years later is\r\nworth quoting, both for the particulars it gives as to his trouble, and\r\nfor the fine spirit of manly endurance it reveals, recalling vividly\r\nthe similar spirit displayed by Beethoven in his famous letter to his\r\nbrothers. 'The loud buzzing and roaring in the head,' he says, 'as\r\nthough I were standing under a great waterfall, remains to-day, and\r\ncontinues day and night without any interruption, louder when my mind\r\nis employed actively, and weaker when I am in a calmer condition of\r\nmind. When I compose the buzzing is noisier. I hear absolutely nothing,\r\nnot even my own voice. Shrill tones, as the cry of a child or the\r\nbarking of a dog, I hear very well, just as I do loud whistling, and\r\nyet, I cannot determine what the noise is, or where it comes from.\r\nConversation with me is impossible. I hear my own piano playing only in\r\nfancy, not in reality. I cannot hear the playing of anybody else, not\r\neven the performance of a full orchestra in opera or in concert. I do\r\nnot think that it is possible for me to improve. I have no pain in the\r\near, and the physicians agree that my disease is none of the familiar\r\ndiseases of the ear, but something else, perhaps a paralysis of the\r\nnerves and the labyrinth. And so I am completely determined to endure\r\nmy sad fate in a manly and calm way as long as I live.'\r\n\r\nAside from its deep musical beauty, a peculiar interest attaches to\r\nthe string quartet entitled by Smetana _Aus meinen Leben_ ('From\r\nMy Life') because of the account it gives in tones of his great\r\naffliction. The autobiographical character is maintained throughout.\r\nThe first movement, in E minor, _allegro vivo appassionato_, with its\r\nconstant turbulence and restless aspiration, depicts, according to the\r\ncomposer, his 'predisposition toward romanticism.' The second, _quasi\r\npolka_, 'bears me,' he says, 'back to the joyance of my youth, when as\r\ncomposer I overwhelmed the world with dance tunes and was known as a\r\npassionate dancer.' The _largo sostenuto_, the third movement, perhaps\r\nmusically the finest of all, is built on two exceedingly earnest and\r\nnoble melodies which are worked out with elaborate and most felicitous\r\nembroidering detail. They tell of the composer's love for his wife\r\nand his happy marriage. Of all the movements the finale is the most\r\ndramatic. Indeed, it is one of the most dramatic pieces in all chamber\r\nmusic. It opens in E major, _Vivace, fortissimo_--an indescribable\r\nbustle of happy folk themes jostling each other. A buoyant secondary\r\nmelody is a little quieter but still full of childlike joy. These two\r\nthemes alternate in rondo fashion, are developed with never-flagging\r\nenergy, and suggest the composer's joy in his native folk-music and its\r\nuse in his art. At the height of the jollity there is a sudden pause, a\r\nsinister tremolo of the middle strings, and the first violin sounds a\r\nlong high E, shrill, piercing, insistent. 'It is,' says Smetana, 'the\r\nharmful piping of the highest tone in my ear that in 1878 announced\r\nmy deafness.'[22] All the bustle dies away, we hear reminiscences,\r\nfull now of a tragic meaning, of the themes of the first movement, and\r\nthe music dies out with a mournful murmuring of the viola and a few\r\npizzicato chords.\r\n\r\nIf the string quartet is thus intimately personal in a high degree, the\r\nseries of orchestral tone-poems, 'My Country,' dedicated to the city of\r\nPrague, is national in scope. Number I, _Vyšehrad_, depicts the ancient\r\nfortress, once a scene of glory, and its melancholy decline into ruin\r\nand decay. In Number II, _Vltava_ or 'The Moldau,' the most popular\r\nof all, we hear the two tiny rivulets which, rising in the mountain,\r\nflow down and unite to form the mighty river Moldau. 'Sárka,' the\r\nthird (1875), refers to a valley north of the capital, which was named\r\nfor the noblest of mythical Bohemian amazons. 'From Bohemia's Fields\r\nand Groves,' Number IV (1875), is built on several intensely Czechic\r\ntunes, and reaches a dizzying climax on a most delightful polka theme.\r\nIn 'Tabor,' Number V (1878), is introduced the favorite war-chorale of\r\nthe Taborites. The last of the series, _Blaník_ (1879), pictures the\r\nmountain on which the Hussite warriors sleep until they shall have to\r\nfight again for their country. The orchestration of the whole series is\r\nas brilliant as the themes are spirited and attractive, and they are\r\nuniversal favorites in the concert hall.\r\n\r\nSmetana wrote a good deal of choral and piano music, as well as other\r\norchestral works; but it is by 'My Country,' the quartet, and 'The\r\nBartered Bride' that he will continue to be known. Fortunately for\r\nhim, his greatness was recognized during his lifetime; he was idolized\r\nby his countrymen; and he knew the pleasure of public triumphs at the\r\nfiftieth anniversary, in 1880, of his first appearance as a pianist,\r\nat the opening of the new national theatre in 1881, and on other\r\noccasions. But when his sixtieth birthday, March 2, 1884, was honored\r\nby a national festival, he was unable to be present for a tragic\r\nreason. His nerves had been troubling him for some time. When _Die\r\nTeufelsmauer_ was coldly received in 1882 he said, 'I am, then, at\r\nlast too old, and I ought not to write anything more, because nobody\r\nwishes to hear from me.' Later he complained, 'I feel myself tired out,\r\nsleepy, and I fear that the quickness of musical thoughts has gone from\r\nme.' Gradually he lost his memory and his power to read. He was not\r\npermitted by the doctors to compose or even to think music. Only a few\r\nweeks before his sixtieth birthday he had to be put in an asylum, and\r\nthere, without regaining his mind, he died, May 12, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nUntoward as was Smetana's personal fate, he was fortunate artistically\r\nin having at hand a younger contemporary of genius equal and similar\r\nto his to whom he could pass on the torch he had lighted. His friend\r\nand protégé, Antonin Dvořák, at this time forty-two years old, had not\r\nonly felt his direct influence during formative years, but resembled\r\nhim in temperament and in artistic ideals to a degree remarkable\r\neven for fellow citizens of a small country like Bohemia. Both were\r\nimpulsive, impressionable, unreflective in temper; both found in the\r\nstrong dance rhythms and the simple yet poignant melodies of the people\r\ntheir natural expression; in both the classic qualities--reticence,\r\nrestraint, balance--were acquired rather than instinctive. In Dvořák,\r\nhowever, there was an even greater richness and sensuous warmth than\r\nin the older man, and his music is thus, in the memorable phrase of\r\nMr. Hadow, 'more Corinthian than, Doric,' has 'a certain opulence, a\r\ncertain splendor and luxury to which few other musicians have attained.'\r\n\r\nAntonin Dvořák, born in 1841, eldest of eight children of the village\r\nbutcher in Nelahozeves on the Moldau, knew poverty and music from\r\nhis earliest days. At fourteen he could sing and play the violin,\r\nthe piano, and the organ. A year later came his first appearance as\r\nan orchestral composer. Planning to persuade his reluctant father\r\nby practical demonstration that he was destined to write music, he\r\nprepared for the village band an original polka, with infinite pains,\r\nbut alas! in ignorance that the brass instruments do not play the exact\r\nnotes written. He wrote what he wanted to hear, but what he heard might\r\nwell have induced him to resign himself to butchery. That it did not,\r\nthat he still held out against parental opposition and was finally\r\nallowed to go to Prague, is an evidence of that tenacity which was in\r\nthe essence of his character. At Prague he entered the Organ School,\r\nplayed in churches and restaurants, and earned about nine dollars a\r\nmonth, on which he lived. An occasional concert he managed to hear by\r\nhiding behind the kettledrums of a friendly player, but classical music\r\nhe met for the first time when, already twenty-one, he borrowed some\r\nscores of Beethoven and Mendelssohn from Smetana. Symphonic composition\r\nhe acquired laboriously and with surprising skill; the polka and the\r\nfuriant were in his blood.\r\n\r\nHe now spent about ten years composing industriously, in poverty and\r\ncomplete obscurity. In 1871 came the long-awaited chance to emerge,\r\nin the shape of an invitation to write an opera for the national\r\ntheatre. In writing this his first opera, 'The King and the Collier'\r\n(Prague, 1874), he allowed himself to be misled by his curious facility\r\nin imitating other styles than his own. Mr. Hadow tells the story\r\nat length. The point of it is that Dvořák, acting on a momentary\r\nenthusiasm for Wagner, which his music shows that he afterwards\r\noutgrew, committed the surprising folly of giving his countrymen, at\r\nthe very moment when they were initiating a successful campaign for\r\nnative art, a Wagnerian music-drama under the guise of Czech operetta!\r\nIt was only a momentary aberration, but it is worth mentioning because\r\nit illustrates a child-like uncriticalness which was as much a part\r\nof Dvořák as his freshness of feeling, his love of color, and his\r\npersistence. Soon realizing his error he rewrote the music in a more\r\nappropriate style. It then appeared that the libretto, too, was wrong.\r\nAnyone else would have given the matter up in disgust; but Dvořák had\r\nthe book also rewritten, and in this third version his work won him his\r\nfirst operatic success.[23]\r\n\r\nSoon he began to be known outside Bohemia. In 1875 he received a\r\ngrant from the Austrian Ministry of Education, on the strength of a\r\nsymphony and an opera submitted. Two years later, offering to the same\r\nbody his Moravian duets and some of his recent chamber music, he was\r\nfortunate enough to have them examined by Brahms, one of the committee.\r\nBrahms cordially recommended his work to Simrock, the great Berlin\r\nmusic publishing house, with the result that his compositions began\r\nto be widely disseminated and he was commissioned to write a set of\r\ncharacteristic national dances. The result of this commission was the\r\nfirst set of Slavonic Dances, opus 46, later supplemented by eight\r\nmore, opus 72. These dances are as characteristic as any of Dvořák's\r\nworks. Their melodic and rhythmic animation is indescribable; while the\r\nbasis is national folk-song the themes are imaginatively treated and\r\nled through many distant keys with the happy inconsequence peculiar\r\nto Dvořák; and the whole is orchestrated with the richness, variety,\r\nand delicacy that make him one of the greatest orchestral masters\r\nof all time. The same qualities are found in the beautiful Slavonic\r\nRhapsodies, the overtures _Mein Heim_ and _Husitska_, both based on\r\nCzechish melodies, and, mixed with more classic elements, in the two\r\nsets of symphonic variations and the five symphonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the choral field Dvořák is best known by his admirable _Stabat\r\nMater_ (1883), written in a pure classical style, as if based on the\r\nbest Italian models, and of large inspiration. There are also an\r\noratorio 'St. Ludmila' (1886), more conventional, a requiem mass, and\r\nseveral cantatas. Of many sets of beautiful solo songs, special mention\r\nmay be made of the Gypsy Songs, opus 55, _Im Volkston_, opus 73, and\r\nthe 'Love Songs,' opus 83. The duets, 'Echos of Moravia,' are fine.\r\nThere is much piano music, too, but charming as are the 'Humoresques,'\r\nopus 101, the 'Poetic Mood-Pictures,' opus 85, and some others, it may\r\nbe said that Dvořák is less at home with the piano than with other\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one might with reason place his chamber music even\r\nhigher than his orchestral work, for it is as admirably suited to its\r\nmedium, and its soberer palette restrains his almost barbaric love of\r\ncolor. His pianoforte quintet in A major, opus 81, with its broadly\r\nconceived allegro, its tender andante, founded on the elegiac dumka of\r\nhis country, and its immensely spirited scherzo and finale, is surely\r\none of the finest quintets written since Schumann immortalized the\r\ncombination. As for his string quartets, they must equally take their\r\nplace in the front rank of modern chamber music, beside the quartets of\r\nBrahms, Franck, Tschaikowsky, and d'Indy. The last two, opera 105 and\r\n106, are perhaps the best. Those who charge Dvořák with 'lack of depth'\r\nwould do well to penetrate a little more deeply themselves into such\r\nthings as the _Lento e molto cantabile_ of the former.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Bohemian Composers:\r\n\r\n             Antonin Dvořák          Friedrich Smetana\r\n             Zdenko Fibich              Joseph Suk\r\n\r\nA special niche among the works of this wondrously fertile mind must\r\nbe reserved for the so-called American works, written during his\r\nsojourn in New York in the early nineties. These are the Quartet,\r\nopus 96, the Quintet, opus 97, and the famous symphony, 'From the New\r\nWorld,' opus 95. The importance of the negro element in these works has\r\nperhaps been exaggerated. It is true that we find in them the rhythmic\r\nsnap of rag-time, the melancholy crooning cadences of the 'spirituals,'\r\nand even the scale of five notes ('pentatonic scale'). It is even true\r\nthat there is a more or less close resemblance between some of their\r\nthemes and certain well-known songs, as, for instance, between the\r\nsecond theme of the first movement of the symphony and 'Swing Low,\r\nSweet Chariot,' or between the scherzo of the Quintet and 'Old Man\r\nMoses, He Sells Roses.' But, after all, the treatment is more important\r\nthan the theme; and it is because Dvořák is a great musician that the\r\npathos of the largo in the symphony moves us as it does, and that he\r\ncan make us as merry with a bit of rag-time as with a furiant. He was\r\none of the musicians most richly endowed by nature, and one who knew\r\nnothing of national boundaries; he was, indeed, a veritable Schubert\r\nin fertility and spontaneity. And, as it was said of Schubert that\r\nhe 'could set a wall-advertisement to music,' so it might be said of\r\nDvořák that he could have made even Indian tunes interesting--had he\r\ntried. It is pleasant to add that he got universal love in response to\r\nthis more than Midas-like transmuting power of his, and that the poor\r\nBohemian boy, after becoming rich and famous, died full of honors, but\r\nas simple at heart as ever, in 1904. He was described in an obituary\r\nnotice as 'Pan Antonin of the sturdy little figure, the jovial smile,\r\nthe kindly heart, and the school-girl modesty.'\r\n\r\nOf other Bohemian composers contemporary with or earlier than Dvořák\r\nnone are of sufficient importance to require more than briefest\r\nmention. These are: Joseph Nesvadba (1824-1876), who wrote Bohemian\r\nsongs and choral works; Franz Skuherský (1830-1892), who wrote Czech\r\noperas, chamber music, and theoretical works; Menzel Theodor Bradský\r\n(1833-1881), who wrote both German and Czech operas; Joseph Rozkosny\r\n(born 1833), who wrote Czech operas, masses, songs, and instrumental\r\nmusic; and Wilhelm Blodek (1834-1874), who wrote Czech operas and\r\ninstrumental music. A somewhat more important figure is that of Karl\r\nBendl (1838-1897), composer of Czech operas and ballets, who was\r\nconductor of the chief choral society in Prague, influential in the\r\n_Interimstheater_, and who 'jointly with Smetana and Dvořák enjoys the\r\ndistinction of winning general recognition for Czech musical art.' His\r\noperas _Lejla_, _Bretislav and Jitka_, _Cernahoreí_, _Karel Streta_,\r\nand _Dite Tabora_ are all on the standing repertory of the National\r\nTheatre at Prague.\r\n\r\nAdalbert Hřimalý (1842-1908), who wrote Czech operas, and whose\r\n'Enchanted Prince' (1870) has proved a lasting success, deserves\r\nmention in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nBetween Smetana and Dvořák and the contemporary Bohemians stands\r\nZdenko Fibich, a most prolific composer, well known in Bohemia but\r\nlittle heard of outside it. Fibich was born at Leborschitz in Bohemia,\r\nDecember 21, 1850. Studying at Prague and later at the Leipzig\r\nConservatory, he became in 1876 assistant conductor of the National\r\nTheatre in Prague, and in 1878 director of the Russian Church choir.\r\nHe is said to have written over seven hundred works, but they are more\r\nfacile than profound. Of his many Czechish operas the most successful\r\nwas 'Sárka' (1898). He was much interested in the musical form known\r\nas 'melodrama' (not to be confused with the stage melodrama). It is a\r\nrecited action accompanied by music; classic examples are Schumann's\r\n'Manfred' and Bizet's _L'Arlésienne_. Fibich wrote six melodramas,\r\nthree 'scenic melodramas,' and a melodramatic trilogy, _Hippodamia_\r\n(text by Brchliky, 1891). His orchestral works include several\r\nsymphonic poems, two symphonies, and several overtures, of which 'A\r\nNight on Karlstein' is well known. He also wrote chamber music, songs\r\nand choruses, piano pieces, and a method for pianoforte. He died in\r\n1900.\r\n\r\nA number of minor composers, contemporaries of Fibich, are only of\r\nlocal importance for their Czechish operas, produced in Prague. Such\r\nare Heinrich von Káan-Albést (born 1852), director of the Prague\r\nConservatory in 1907; Vása Suk (born 1861), composer of the opera _Der\r\nWaldkönig_ (1900); Karl Navrátil (born 1867), who writes symphonic\r\npoems and chamber music; and Karl Kovařovic (born 1862), conductor of\r\nthe Royal Bohemian _Landes und National-Theater_. This theatre was\r\nerected in 1883, by subscription from Czechs in Bohemia, Moravia,\r\nSilesia, northern Hungary, even the colony in America. The Austrian\r\ngovernment is said to be not very favorable to it, vetoing the posting\r\nof placards announcing performances in Austrian watering places. The\r\nsubsidy is raised by the country of Bohemia, not by the government.\r\nIn August, 1903, a cycle of operas was given here, including Fibich's\r\n'The Fall of Arcana,' Kovařovic's _Têtes de chien_, Nedbal's _Le Gros\r\nJean_,[24] Dvořák's _Roussalka_ and several operas of Smetana.\r\n\r\nA better known composer of Czechish operas is Emil Nikolaus von\r\nReznicek, who was, however, born not in Bohemia but at Vienna, May 4,\r\n1861. His comic opera _Donna Diana_, produced in 1894 at Prague, made\r\nso great a success that in a short time it was heard in forty-three\r\nEuropean opera-houses. Other operas by him are _Die Jungfrau von\r\nOrleans_ (1887), _Satanella_ (1888), _Emmerich Fortunat_ (1889), and\r\n_Till Eulenspiegel_ (1901), on the subject made famous by Strauss's\r\nwitty symphonic poem. For orchestra he has written a 'Tragic Symphony,'\r\nan 'Ironic Symphony,' an 'Idyllic Overture,' a 'Comedy Overture,' two\r\nsymphonic suites, etc., while a string quartet was played by the Dessau\r\nQuartet at Berlin in 1906.\r\n\r\nFibich's pupil O. Ostřcil, whose contrapuntal skill and brilliant\r\norchestration testify to his ability, has written the operas 'Kunal's\r\nEyes,' 'The Fall of Wlasta,' and 'Buds' (_Knospen_), also an Impromptu\r\nand a Suite for orchestra. Of the pupils of Dvořák Rudolf Karel has\r\nwritten a symphony in E-flat minor and _Jugend_, a symphonic poem\r\nin which he pictures the struggles of a youth of genius; and Alois\r\nReiser is known as the composer of an opera, _Gobi_, showing melodic\r\nand harmonic originality without exaggeration, and of a trio, a\r\n'cello concerto, and solo pieces for violin in which his nationality\r\nis reflected. Other contemporaries are Ottokar Jeremiaš (symphonies,\r\novertures, and chamber music) and his brother Jaroslav Jeremiaš, a\r\nfollower in his two operas of modern French tendencies; K. Krǐcka, W.\r\nStepán, J. Maxner, B. Novotny, and others.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the two most important living Bohemian composers are\r\nJoseph Suk and Vitešlav Novák. Suk, who was born at Křecovic, January\r\n4, 1874, became a pupil of Dvořák at the Prague Conservatory in 1888,\r\nand later married his daughter. He is second violin of the Bohemian\r\nQuartet. Among his works may be mentioned a 'Dramatic Overture,' an\r\noverture to 'A Winter's Tale,' a Symphony in E, a suite entitled 'A\r\nFairy Tale,' a piano quartet, a piano quintet, and two string quartets.\r\nThe symphony (in E major, op. 14, published in Berlin) has charm and is\r\nmost skillfully written, especially for the strings, like everything\r\nby this violinist-composer, but is somewhat prolix and student-like,\r\nrevealing Dvořák in many places, and in the finale containing a theme\r\ntoo obviously suggested by the overture to Smetana's 'The Bartered\r\nBride.' 'A Fairy Tale,' op. 16, sonorously and brilliantly scored, is\r\nof programmistic character, especially the fourth movement. Both of\r\nthese orchestral works introduce a number of folk-themes. This is also\r\nthe case in an early string quartet, op. 11 (1896), in B-flat major,\r\nthe finale of which is built on a polka tune in six-bar phrases.\r\n\r\nIf one were to judge him by these things one would say that Suk was\r\na skillful violinist who thoroughly understood how to write for\r\nhis instrument, that he had caught much of the charm of Bohemian\r\nfolk-melody and especially of Dvořák's way of treating it, but that his\r\nmusical expression was neither very far-reaching nor very original.\r\nHe may have felt this himself, for in his second quartet, op. 31,\r\npublished in 1911, he has thrown over his earlier style completely,\r\nand adopted a so-called 'modern idiom.' The work is played in one\r\nmovement, without pauses. It is full of changes of tempo and of key,\r\nextremely complicated in harmony, frightfully difficult for the players\r\nas regards intonation, and difficult for the listeners, too, from its\r\nspasmodic and constantly changing character. So far as one can tell\r\nabout such a work from reading the score, it would seem as if the\r\ncomposer had abandoned his natural speech here without gaining real\r\neloquence in exchange. Whether he be misguided or not, however, there\r\ncan be no doubt of his marked natural talent for the same kind of\r\nimpulsive, fresh musical expression we find in Smetana and Dvořák.\r\n\r\nThe music of Novák, on the other hand, if less immediately\r\ningratiating, is much more thoughtful. The influence of Dvořák is less\r\nfelt in it than those of Schumann and Brahms. Although the Bohemian\r\nand also the allied Moravian and Hungarian-Slovak folk-melodies are to\r\nsome extent drawn upon for material, the treatment is more intellectual\r\nthan popular, rhythmic subtleties abound, and the types of construction\r\nare often highly complex and ingenious, there being considerable use\r\nof those cyclic transformations of a single theme throughout a long\r\ncomposition to which César Franck and his school attribute so high a\r\nvalue. It is worth noting that Novák, who was born December 5, 1870, at\r\nKamenitz, Bohemia, is a man of general as well as technical education,\r\nhaving attended the Bohemian University and the Conservatory of Music\r\nat Prague. He has continued to live in Prague as a music teacher,\r\nseveral times receiving a state grant for composition. Among his works\r\nare an Overture to a Moravian Popular Drama, op. 18, the symphonic\r\npoems 'On the Lofty Tatra,' op. 26, and 'Eternal Longing,' op. 33, a\r\n'Slovak Suite,' op. 32, two piano trios, two string quartets, a piano\r\nquartet, a piano quintet, and a piano sonata.\r\n\r\nIn his early compositions Novák shows the influence of the German\r\nromantic school, as in the trio, op. 1, with its somewhat pompous main\r\ntheme and its contrasting theme for 'cello solo, verging dangerously\r\nupon the sentimental. The piano quartet, op. 7 (1900), on a striking\r\nand even noble theme, suffers from Brahmsian mannerisms of style\r\nand a treatment at times drily academic. On the other hand, the\r\npiano quintet, op. 12 (published in 1904, but doubtless written much\r\nearlier), on a plaintively poetic folk-theme in A minor, and the first\r\nstring quartet, op. 22 (1902), show clearly the more native influence\r\nof his master Dvořák. He thus shows the impressionability of all really\r\nhighly-endowed minds, and in his mature works writes with as much\r\nflexibility as authority. The _Trio quasi una Ballata_, op. 27 (1903),\r\nand the second string quartet, op. 35 (1906), are masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThe trio is dramatic and powerful in expression, original in style\r\nand structure. It begins, _andante tragico_, with a fine bold melody,\r\nof folk character, in D minor, given out by the violin, and later\r\npowerfully developed by the piano. A secondary section in D-flat,\r\nalso somewhat 'folkish,' immediately follows, without break. Next,\r\nagain without pause, comes a 'quasi scherzo, allegro burlesca' in G\r\nminor, the 'trio' of which is ingeniously derived from the main theme\r\nof the work. Recitative-like passages in the strings and cadenzas for\r\nthe piano then lead back to the original andante theme, worked out\r\nin combination with subsidiary matter and bringing the whole to an\r\nimpressive soft close.\r\n\r\nThe string quartet in D major is equally original, though different\r\nin mood. Dramatic declamation here gives place to a meditative\r\nthoughtfulness especially suited to the four strings. There are but two\r\nmovements. The first is a fugue, _largo misterioso_, on a deliberate,\r\nimpressive theme, in the mood of the later Beethoven--a fugue admirably\r\nfresh and spontaneous, with the accepted 'inversions' of the theme and\r\nso on, to be sure, but coming less as academic prescriptions than as\r\nnatural flowerings of the thought. The second movement, _Fantasia_,\r\nis composite, containing first suggestions of the root theme (of the\r\nfugue), introducing a sort of sonata-exposition in which the same fugue\r\nthen figures as first subject and a new melody as second; then, instead\r\nof a development, a scherzo section, derived again from the root theme;\r\nthen the recapitulation of the two themes, completing the suggested\r\nsonata; and finally, a literal repetition of the last three pages of\r\nthe fugue movement, thus binding the two parts into unity. The scheme\r\nof construction is thus as original as the music itself is impressive\r\nand beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf Novák can avoid the pitfall of over-intellectualism peculiar to his\r\ntemperament, he may easily become one of the most vital forces in\r\ncontemporary European music.\r\n\r\n    D. G. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nIt may appear surprising at first that Hungary, a thousand-year-old\r\nnation, has not until our own day achieved an independent cultural\r\nexistence, and more especially an individual musical art. For we know\r\nthat the Magyar race is inherently musical and recent researches\r\nhave unearthed unsuspected treasures of folk-song as ancient as they\r\nare characteristic. There has indeed been for some time a recognized\r\nHungarian 'flavor' utilized in the manner of an exotic by various\r\ncomposers, notably Brahms and Liszt, and the dance rhythms so utilized\r\nhave proved no less fascinating than those of the Slavs, for instance.\r\nBut native Hungarian composers have not until recently developed these\r\nartistic germs with sufficient ability to arouse the attention of the\r\nmusical world.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the political condition of Hungary during its long\r\nhistory, however, we no longer wonder at the dearth of national\r\nculture. Twice the country was utterly desolated, for ages the people\r\npossessed no political independence, no constitution, and did not use\r\ntheir own language--indeed their native tongue was suppressed by a\r\ntyrannical government until late in the nineteenth century. With the\r\nrecrudescence of national independence there came, as elsewhere, a\r\nrevival of nationalistic culture, and it is nothing short of remarkable\r\nthat within hardly more than a generation Hungary has raised itself,\r\nin music especially, to a point where its own sons are capable of\r\nbrilliant and characteristically native achievement. At any rate it\r\nargues eloquently for the profound musical and poetic instincts which\r\nwere latent in the race.\r\n\r\nA brief historical review of early musical endeavor in Hungary may\r\nnot be without value as an introduction to our treatment of its modern\r\ncomposers. When the Hungarians first occupied their present country (A.\r\nD. 896) they found no music whatever in their new home. The musical\r\ninstinct born in them, however, was very strong, for they sang when\r\npraying, when preparing for war, at burials and festivals, and their\r\nfirst Christian king, Stephan I (997-1038), founded a school where\r\nsinging was taught. In fact, the power of music was respected so much\r\nthat early musicians were called _hegedös_, a word not derived from\r\nthe Hungarian _hegedü_ (violin), but from _heged_--'having healed the\r\nwounds.' In the fourteenth century, when the first gypsies migrated to\r\nHungary, they found there a people whose music was already so highly\r\ndeveloped that the newcomers themselves learned their melodies from\r\nthem. It was through the songs of the Hungarians that the gypsies\r\nbecame famous, and we have to bear in mind that the great merit of the\r\ngypsies was not in creating melodies, but in making them popularly\r\nknown from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of the great national king, Mathias I (1458-1490),\r\nmusic flourished and was even highly cherished. The king, who made\r\nHungary one of the greatest powers of Europe in that period, possessed\r\nan organ with silver pipes, and an orchestra. He also had in his\r\nservice numerous court singers, who sang of the heroic deeds of\r\nnational heroes. That musicians were highly esteemed there we infer\r\nfrom the fact that such musicians as Adrian Willaert and Thomas Stolzer\r\nwere in the service of King Louis II (1516-1526). After the battle\r\nof Mohács (1526) the whole country was brought under the yoke of the\r\nTurks, and almost every trace of the high culture of the Hungarians\r\nwas destroyed, so that we possess nothing of the musical treasures\r\nof this period. Collections of religious chants (from the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries) show that sacred music exerted a notable\r\ninfluence upon Hungarian folk-music. The folk element, however, was\r\nalready very strong at the time of Sebastian Tinody (1510-1554), whose\r\nhistorical songs displayed genuine and pure Hungarian qualities.\r\nNot before the middle of the sixteenth century was the character of\r\nHungarian music reflected outside of Hungary--at first in pieces called\r\n_Passamezzo_ and _Ongaro_, published in various German and Italian\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the further development of Hungarian music we find that\r\nin the latter part of the seventeenth century some stage productions\r\nincluded songs. At about the same time the Rákóczyan era of national\r\nstruggles brought forth many beautiful and impressive melodies. These\r\ntreasures were of no small influence upon the evolution of national\r\nmusic, brought into still greater prominence by musicians whom we may\r\ncall the real originators of the Hungarian idiom. They were Lavotta\r\n(1764-1820), Csermák (1771-1822), and Bihari (1769-1827). Lavotta's\r\ncompositions were genuinely characteristic Hungarian products, showing\r\nmastery of invention and skill in handling the national rhythms. He\r\npossessed a vivid fancy and a wealth of ideas, but no technique. While\r\nhis most important work had the promising title of 'The Siege of\r\nSzigetvár,'[25] it was composed for a solo violin without accompaniment\r\nand its musical ideas were not over eight to sixteen measures in\r\nlength. Lavotta's other compositions, such as his 'Serenade,'[26] in\r\nmodern arrangements are extremely effective. Some of his 'folk-songs'\r\nwill live forever.\r\n\r\nLavotta's pupil, the Bohemian Csermák, produced some characteristic\r\ndances. He, too, lacked solidity of structure. The compositions of the\r\nbrilliant gypsy violinist, Bihari (some of which are preserved in\r\nvarious transcriptions), are the most valuable examples of old national\r\nHungarian music. The famous Rákoczy march, as we know it through the\r\ntranscriptions of Liszt and Berlioz, is his work, being a remodelled\r\nversion of the original, plaintive Rákoczy song composed about 1675 by\r\nM. Barna.\r\n\r\nSumming up, we may distinguish the following six periods in the\r\nhistory of Hungarian music from its beginning: the age of the Pagan\r\nHungarians, those whose songs were so persistent that three centuries\r\nafter the introduction of Christianity the Councils found it necessary\r\nto suppress them; the period from the rise of Christianity to the\r\nfifteenth century, when as elsewhere music was wholly in the service\r\nof the church, while secular music was cultivated only by wandering\r\nminstrels; the three centuries following, when the growing influence\r\nof the gypsies is most powerfully felt, when Lutheran and Calvinistic\r\nchurches spread among the people, and when the folk-songs alive in\r\nthe mouths of the people to-day were born; the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen Hungarian national music became more independent and individual,\r\nHungarian rhythms especially became strongly pronounced, and the\r\nfundamental principles of absolute music were laid down; and the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century, which produced the first masters. The\r\nlast of the six periods is that of the contemporary composers and of\r\n'young Hungary.'\r\n\r\nIn a few words we have endeavored to give a sketch of the first\r\nfour divisions. The transition to the next--the period of the first\r\nmasters--may be marked by the first opera with a Hungarian libretto.\r\nThis was 'Duke Pikko and Tuttka Perzsi,' performed in 1793 under\r\nLavotta. The work was without any significance whatsoever. The first\r\nnoteworthy attempt in the direction of national grand opera was 'Béla's\r\nFlight' by Ruzicska (1833). That composer preferred the forms of the\r\nlight and popular Hungarian folk-songs to a more serious vein. He\r\nshould be given credit for his ambitious attempt to create a truly\r\nnational historical opera, Hungarian both in music and in text. He\r\nwas followed by Franz Erkel (1810-1893), whose operas, with subjects\r\ntaken from Hungarian history, are still played to-day. His music was\r\ngenuinely Hungarian in character and had absolute value. The overture\r\nto his _Hunyady László_, with its classical form and poetic content,\r\nwas made popular in Europe through the efforts of Liszt. Erkel was\r\ncareful in selecting his dramatic subjects, drawing freely upon\r\nHungarian history. The subject of his most successful work, _Bánk-Bán_,\r\nhas also inspired the mediæval German poet Hans Sachs, the eminent\r\nAustrian dramatist Grillparzer, and the Hungarian Josef Katona, whose\r\ntragedy of the same title represents the best in Hungarian dramatic\r\nliterature. Contemporary with Erkel but of much less significance was\r\nM. Mosonyi (1814-1870), who preserved the Hungarian character in his\r\noperas and orchestral compositions as well as in his piano pieces. His\r\n'Studies' were highly esteemed by Wagner.\r\n\r\nThe further development of Hungarian culture and music in the\r\nnineteenth century closely reflects the influence of the French,\r\nGermans, and Italians, although the national ambition of the Hungarians\r\nto remodel the foreign examples according to their own genius is\r\nevident. It is upon this principle that Hungary to-day produces musical\r\nworks of absolute merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nThe most significant representatives of modern Hungarian music are\r\nÖdön Mihálovich, Count Géza Zichy, and Jenö Hubay. The compositions\r\nof these men should be considered first as works of absolute merit,\r\nregardless of their nationality; second, for the Hungarian national\r\nelements which they unconsciously display; and, finally, as noble,\r\nthough not completely successful, attempts to apply these elements\r\nand characteristics to serious modern forms. Though much preoccupied\r\nwith this problem, they cannot be criticized for the lack of strong\r\nindividuality, since their personalities almost always overshadow\r\nthe Hungarian qualities in their works, which, however, are still\r\nsufficiently prominent to typify them as Hungarian composers. Each of\r\nthe three received his training under the most eminent foreign masters,\r\nby which fact they were peculiarly fitted to become the teachers of\r\n'young Hungary,' and incidentally the real founders of the modern\r\nHungarian school.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the three, Mihálovich, was born in 1842. He studied with\r\nHauptmann in Leipzig, with Bülow in Munich, and was in personal touch\r\nwith Liszt and Wagner. In his position as the director of the Hungarian\r\nRoyal National Academy of Music in Budapest he exercises a strong and\r\nsalutary influence upon present Hungarian musical life. It is due\r\nto his efforts that this unique school maintains an extraordinarily\r\nhigh standard. As a composer he is versatile and prolific. He has\r\nsuccessfully applied his talent to every form from song to grand\r\nopera ('Hagbart and Signe,' 'Toldi's Love,' 'Eliana,' and _Wieland\r\nder Schmied_, upon the libretto planned by Wagner). He has written a\r\nSymphony in D and several symphonic poems ('Sellö,' 'Pan's Death,' 'The\r\nShip of Ghosts,' 'Hero and Leander,' _Ronde du Sabbat_, etc.). He is a\r\nmaster of orchestration and displays superior craftsmanship in working\r\nout his thematic material. His style shows a fusion of Wagnerian\r\nelements and of the principles of nineteenth-century program music with\r\nHungarian national characteristics. His musical ideas are usually lofty\r\nand of refined taste.\r\n\r\nCount Géza Zichy (born 1849) is an aristocrat in the best sense of\r\nthe word. The qualities of the man of noble birth and high rank (he\r\nis a privy councillor to the king, a member of the House of Lords,\r\nthe president of the National Music Conservatory, etc.), the fine\r\nsensibility of a man endowed with talent and trained under the best\r\nmasters (he studied with and was a friend of Liszt and Volkmann)\r\nare reflected in his works as a poet, an author, a virtuoso, and a\r\ncomposer. A man of wealth, he employs his means in the realization\r\nof high artistic ideals. When as a lad of fourteen he lost his right\r\narm he experienced the lesson of physical and spiritual suffering\r\nand grew up to be a man of unusually intense energy.[27] Instead of\r\ngiving up his favorite art of piano playing he developed himself into\r\nthe greatest of left-arm virtuosos. His remarkable playing, besides\r\ndisplaying an almost incredible technique, reflects the feelings of a\r\ntruly poetic soul. 'His playing is remarkable in every respect, since\r\nit is gentle and full of soul, of enthusiasm, and of incomparable\r\n_bravour_,' wrote Fétis,[28] and Hanslick remarked 'there are many who\r\ncan play, a few who can charm, but only Zichy can bewitch with his\r\nplaying.' It is characteristic of him as a man and as an artist that\r\nhe never accepts any fee for playing; he plays only for charity. 'I am\r\nhappy,' he wrote to a critic, 'to be in the service of the poor and of\r\nthe unfortunate and to earn bread for them through my hard work.'\r\n\r\nCount Zichy's compositions for the piano--for the left hand alone\r\n(études, a sonata, a serenade, arrangements of Bach, Beethoven, Chopin,\r\nLiszt, Wagner, etc.)--are unique in pianoforte literature. The climax\r\nof his achievement in this field is his Concerto in E-flat. It is\r\ndistinguished by an energetic first movement, by a deeply felt\r\nsecond movement cast in a Hungarian folk-mood, by the brilliancy of the\r\nfinale, and, above all, by its terrific technical demands upon the left\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         Hungarian Composers:\r\n\r\n                  Count Géza Zichy      Jenö Hubay\r\n                 Ernst von Dohnányi    Emanuel Moór\r\n\r\nIn dramatic music Count Zichy began his activity with the opera _Alár_,\r\nupon a Hungarian subject. This was followed by the more successful\r\n'Master Roland,' in which he makes use of a radically modern idiom.\r\nThe work lacks the usual characteristics of Hungarian music. All his\r\nlibretti were written by himself. Stimulated by Wagner's idea that\r\n'through music dance and poetry are reconciled,' he undertook to write\r\na poetic 'dance-poem' (ballet) or melodrama entitled _Gemma_. In this\r\ndramatic (speaking) actors played the chief rôles, while the action was\r\nsupported by recitation, mimicry, dance and symphonic music. This novel\r\nundertaking proved a failure and Zichy later rewrote the whole piece as\r\na regular pantomime.\r\n\r\nThe most ambitious work is his trilogy comprising _Franz Rákoczy II_,\r\n_Nemo_, and _Rodosto_, and dealing with the life of the historical\r\nFranz Rákoczy (1676-1735), 'the great hero and great character, the\r\nloyal, the most chivalrous, the noblest son of Hungary.' Zichy made\r\na deep study of the Rákoczyan era and the librettos themselves as\r\npure dramas are of considerable literary value. With respect to their\r\nhistorical truth the author remarked: 'After two years' study of this\r\nage the figure of the great hero became more and more vivid before my\r\neyes and so I wrote the libretto of my trilogy--or rather I copied it,\r\nsince the life of Rákoczy was itself induced by fate.'\r\n\r\nInto the music of the trilogy there are woven numerous themes dating\r\nfrom the Rákoczyan period. The problem of applying the stylistic\r\nelements of national Hungarian music to modern forms, rhythms and\r\nharmony, however, proved a difficult one; Zichy's solution is a\r\nworthy attempt, but nevertheless only partially successful. Aside\r\nfrom this special purpose the work fascinates by its melodic warmth,\r\nits rhythmic energy, and its masterful workmanship. It is safe to say\r\nthat Zichy's Rákoczy trilogy represents a new phase in the history of\r\nnational Hungarian grand opera.\r\n\r\nOf the three contemporary Hungarian composers Hubay's name is the best\r\nknown internationally.[29] His career as a brilliant violinist (he\r\nfrequently played with Liszt); the fact that he was Wieniawsky's and\r\nVieuxtemps's successor at the Brussels Conservatory; the success of\r\nhis quartet (with Servais as 'cellist), all helped to direct general\r\nattention to him. Both Massenet and Saint-Saëns were much interested\r\nin him. When as a young man of twenty-seven he was called home by the\r\nHungarian government, his fame was already well established. Later he\r\ncontinued playing in the musical centres of Europe and added to his\r\nfame, and when he began to publish (and play) his violin compositions\r\nhe achieved such a sweeping success that he is still popularly regarded\r\nas a composer of well-known violin pieces, to the detriment of the\r\nreputation of his other works.\r\n\r\nThis very attitude of the general public is the highest praise for\r\nHubay's violin compositions. Indeed, their poetic charm, their\r\neffectiveness and singularly idiomatic style stamp him as a genuinely\r\ninspired poet of the instrument. In violin literature he occupies\r\nperhaps the most nearly analogous place to that of Chopin in piano\r\nmusic. His deeply-felt tone-pictures, his 'Csárda (tavern) Scenes,'\r\nin which he preserved many a treasure of Hungarian folk-song, those\r\nmagnificent illustrations of _Sirva vigad a magyar_, those rapturous\r\nHungarian rhapsodies for the violin, are surely not of less value than\r\nmany of Liszt's finest piano compositions.\r\n\r\nThe facts that Hubay's name is chiefly associated with his standard\r\nviolin compositions and that his reputation is mainly that of a great\r\nviolin pedagogue were obstacles to the popularity of his other works.\r\nYet his creative activity has been most varied: he has written songs,\r\nsonatas, concertos, symphonies, and seven operas. One of these operas,\r\n'The Violin Maker of Cremona' (libretto by Coppée), was successfully\r\nperformed in seventy European theatres. The music of the 'Violin\r\nMaker' is characterized by refined elegance, genuine passion, and the\r\nnobility of its ideas. The remark of a Hungarian critic that Hubay's\r\nmusic impresses one 'as if he had composed it with silk gloves on his\r\nhands' may be accepted as real praise, for Hubay's technical mastery\r\nis applied with uniformly exquisite taste. He especially shows his\r\nsuperior musicianship in the operas _Alienor_, 'Two Little Wooden\r\nShoes,' 'A Night of Love,' 'Venus of Milo,' and in the two Hungarian\r\noperas, 'The Village Rover' and 'Lavotta's Love,' the first based on a\r\nHungarian peasant play, the second on the life of the composer Lavotta.\r\n\r\nHubay's two essays in the field of national grand opera are sincere\r\nproducts of his artistic conviction--conscious manifestations of a\r\nnational ambition; he can, therefore, not be accused of trying to hide\r\na lack of original invention behind a cloak of folk-music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VI\r\n\r\nBetween Mihálovich, Zichy, Hubay, and the representatives of 'young\r\nHungary' there are composers of note who are not young enough to be\r\nclassified as such nor old enough to be called masters, if we apply\r\nthe term to artistic stature rather than actual age. This applies\r\nespecially to Ernst von Dohnányi (born 1877), a former pupil of the\r\nHungarian Academy and of d'Albert and at present a professor at the\r\nroyal _Hochschule_ in Berlin. Virility, vehement pathos, enthusiasm,\r\nand brilliant sonority are the outstanding qualities of Dohnányi's\r\nmusic. His best works are perhaps in the field of chamber music: the\r\nbeautiful string quartet in D-flat, the 'Trio Serenade,' full of\r\ncaprice and coquetry, the violin sonata in C-sharp minor, a work of\r\nfine inspiration, are of solid merit. His four 'Rhapsodies'--well\r\nknown to pianists--are interesting. One of them reveals the author's\r\nnationality, while another one re-echoes his honored ideal, Brahms. His\r\neffective and brilliant piano concerto, too, speaks here and there in\r\nBrahmsian phraseology. Although he reflects slight special influences\r\nin places (as that of Mahler in his Suite), his style is eclectic\r\nand expresses at the same time a strong individuality. In works of\r\nlarger form he has tried his hand at a symphony (D minor), excelling\r\nin beautiful harmonies, and a comic opera, _Tante Simonia_, containing\r\na characteristic overture in which the jovial character of the comedy\r\nis successfully reflected. This, like his pantomime, 'The Veil of the\r\nPierette,' reveals him as a musical dramatist, with a special gift for\r\neffective orchestration. Dohnányi's substantial accomplishments already\r\nmake it unnecessary to predict for him a place in musical history.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the hyper-critical and unreceptive attitude of modern\r\ncritics is responsible for the lack of popularity of certain composers.\r\nIt would seem that Emanuel Moór is one of these. Moór is a tremendously\r\nprolific composer. He has written no less than five hundred songs,\r\nseven symphonies, three operas, six concertos, and a mass of chamber\r\nmusic. Many of these have real merit; also, they do not lack exponents\r\nand interpreters (witness Marteau, Ysaye, Casals, Bauer, the\r\nFlonzalay Quartet). Still, they have not been able to gain a general\r\nappreciation. Time only will assign a proper place to their creator.\r\nHere, also, should be mentioned the name of J. Bloch, a successful\r\ncomposer of numerous violin pieces.\r\n\r\nNational qualities are displayed to telling advantage in the 'Aphorisms\r\non Hungarian Folk-songs,' by the brilliant Liszt pupil A. Szendi.\r\nIn fact, the 'Aphorisms' (difficult piano pieces) have perhaps more\r\nHungarian color than the Rhapsodies of Liszt. Szendi is also the author\r\nof some good chamber music and of an opera, 'Maria,' which he wrote\r\ntogether with Szabados. 'Maria' is built upon Wagnerian principles.\r\nThe subject of this ambitious opera is the struggle between the\r\nChristian and Pagan Hungarians in the twelfth century. The music, in\r\nwhich Hungarian elements also have a prominent place, is of exquisite\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nWhile Dohnányi and Moór are not living in Hungary, Szendi, Bloch,\r\nand the brilliant group referred to as 'young Hungary' develop their\r\ngrowing talents within the borders of their native land.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the characteristics of the present products of the young\r\nHungarian school are above all individual; but there is also a strong\r\ntendency toward ultra-modernism, and, finally, a certain fragrance of\r\nthe Hungarian soil, a quality that one may feel but can not analyze.\r\nThe aim of the school is no less than the creation of a new national\r\nstyle, which they endeavor to reach by different ways. Brilliance and\r\nrobust individualism characterize every one of these disciples, mostly\r\nof Hungarian education. This is especially true of Leo Weiner (born\r\n1885), whose very first attempt in the field of composition attested\r\na considerable technique. If Weiner's first composition took his\r\nmaster (Hans Koessler[30]) by surprise, a later one, which he wrote\r\nfor the final student's concert of his class, fell little short of\r\nbeing a sensation for musical Europe. This, his last student work--a\r\n'Serenade'--spread his fame through the continent. It was performed in\r\nalmost every musical centre of Europe. In it the composer displays\r\na really individual style of his own. It is full of ideas garbed in\r\nbrilliant orchestration and glows with the fire of enthusiasm. Weiner's\r\ningenious harmonic sense and ability is as astonishing for his age\r\nas his fine architectural sense. In his other works--a quartet in E,\r\na trio in G minor, a sonata for violin and piano in D (a valuable\r\naddition to the list of modern sonatas)--the harmony, while sonorous\r\nand pure, is quite simple, though his modulations often act as\r\nsurprises. In form he never abandons logical progression and artistic\r\nunity, since he never loses the general outline of his movements. It is\r\ntrue that one may find dull moments in Weiner, yet of what composer is\r\nthat not true? Weiner is less successful where he attempts to produce\r\nHungarian color, but as dignified examples of music produced for its\r\nown sake his works are likely to persist.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chief representatives of musical ultra-modernism in Hungary\r\nis Béla Bartók, a remarkable individuality whose modernism has probably\r\nreached its own limits. According to his principles, applied in his\r\ncompositions, every kind of key-relationship is possible. Thus he\r\ncombines a melody E major with a motive A-flat major. His waltz, 'My\r\nSweetheart is Dancing,' is astonishingly grotesque and novel in its\r\npianistic effects. It will hardly fail to make a listener smile or\r\nlaugh--perhaps by direct intention of the composer. Bartók's colleague\r\nin the field of grotesque but effective dissonances is Z. Kodály, with\r\nwhom he undertook the notable task of collecting Hungarian folk-songs\r\nin their genuine natural form. With these true and unalloyed Hungarian\r\nmelodies the two 'futurists' proved that the genuine Hungarian\r\nfolk-song differed essentially from those known generally under\r\nthat name. Bartók's and Kodály's folk-melodies are not built on the\r\nHungarian scale, which is of gypsy invention. They display primitive\r\nqualities and preserve even the influence of the ancient church modes.\r\nThey have a great variety of constantly changing rhythm and metre, and\r\na distinct feature is the frequent return of characteristic formulas,\r\nalso the employment of a peculiar pentatonic scale. Whatever may be\r\nhis merits as a composer, Béla Bartók's work as a scholar in Hungarian\r\nmusic is of unquestioned historical importance.\r\n\r\nAnother young composer whose works are frequently played in foreign\r\ncountries (also in America) is E. Lendway, likewise a pupil of\r\nKoessler. His Symphony has sterling qualities. He has, however,\r\nproduced works of greater significance in chamber music, in piano\r\nmusic, and songs. Especially worthy of mention is a 'Suite' for female\r\nvoices _a cappella_. Old Japanese poems supply the text. These he\r\nhas set to music of genuine poetic _finesse_, delicate and finely\r\nemotional. The whole gives a series of impressive tone-pictures,\r\nreflecting a fascinating exotic atmosphere. As a testimony of Lendway's\r\ntechnical skill it has been pointed out that he has produced Japanese\r\n'color' without using the Japanese scale. True to his modernist\r\npropensities, he makes free use of the whole-tone scale, but with\r\na more specific effect than is usually done. His latest and most\r\nambitious work is an opera, 'Elga,' after Gerhart Hauptmann's drama.\r\n\r\nOther young Hungarians have attracted international attention in the\r\nfield of opera. E. Ábrányi's 'Paolo and Francesca' and 'Monna Vanna'\r\n(after Maeterlinck) have a dramatic power that is promising. He is\r\nat his best in fantastic tone-painting, and remarkable for harmonic\r\ninvention and skill in orchestration. A charming children's opera,\r\n'Cinderella,' is by Á. Buttykay, whose more ambitious symphonic works\r\nmake him an estimable member of the young Hungarian group. Some chamber\r\nmusic works of ultra-modern tendencies and a Symphonic Suite of\r\ningenious orchestration by Radnai raise expectations of still better\r\nthings to come.\r\n\r\nJustice can hardly be done by merely mentioning the names of such men\r\nas Chovan, Gobbi, Farkas, Rékai, Koenig, Siklós, etc., all of whom are\r\nengaged in meritorious creative work. Of no less importance are those\r\nwho work in the field of musicography and criticism. 'The Theory of\r\nHungarian Music,' by Géza Molnár, and 'The Evolution of the Hungarian\r\nFolk-song,' by Fabo, as well as shorter essays by A. Kern, P. Kacsoh,\r\netc., are of especially high value. In conclusion we may say that even\r\na slight study of contemporary Hungarian music will convince one that\r\nthe musical life of the Hungary of to-day adequately reflects the\r\ntendency of the age, and that the country has definitely entered the\r\nrank of the truly musical nations.\r\n\r\n                                                            E.

The reason is that\r\nthe Germans were the only race that, by the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, had beaten out a musical language that was capable of\r\nalmost every kind of expression. Within the ample limits of that\r\nlanguage there was room for the realization of any spirit and any\r\nform--post-classical or progressive, or a union of these two; poetic\r\nor abstract; vocal or instrumental; symphonic or operatic. And in each\r\nsphere the Germans developed both form and spirit to a point attained\r\nby no other nation--in the opera of Wagner, the post-Beethovenian\r\nsymphony of Brahms and Bruckner, the symphonic poem of Strauss, the\r\nsong of Hugo Wolf; while within the separate orbit of each of these\r\nleaders there moved a crowd of lesser but still goodly luminaries.\r\nIt is remarkable, too, that each period that seemed a climax of\r\ndevelopment in this form or that proved to be only the starting-point\r\nfor a new departure. Beethoven's spirit realized itself afresh in\r\nWagner and Brahms, and in remoter but still easily traceable ways in\r\nLiszt and Strauss; in the best of Strauss, again, we can see coursing\r\nthe sap of Wagner, but with a vitality that throws out unexpected,\r\nnew and individual shoots; Schubert and Schumann, each seemingly\r\nso perfect, so complete in himself, blossom into a new and richer\r\nlyrical life in the songs of Hugo Wolf. To make clear the nature and\r\nthe meaning of the modern German developments it will be necessary to\r\nsurvey rapidly the conditions that led up to them.\r\n\r\nBeethoven, especially in his later symphonies, sonatas and quartets,\r\nhad carried music to an intellectual and emotional height for a\r\nparallel to which we have to go back a century, to the colossal work\r\nof Bach. Beethoven bequeathed to music an enormous fund of expression\r\nand a perfected instrument of expression. Both of these were waiting\r\nfor the new composers who could use them for the fertilization of\r\nmodern music. Wagner seized upon the fund rather than the instrument.\r\nIn place of the latter, though, indeed, with its assistance, he forged\r\na new instrument of his own; but the impulse to the forging of it,\r\nand the strength for the forging of it, came to him in large measure\r\nfrom the deep draughts he had drunk of Beethoven's spirit. Schumann\r\n(the symphonic Schumann) and Brahms, on the other hand, were more\r\ncontent with the instrument as Beethoven had left it; or, to vary the\r\nillustration, they were satisfied, speaking broadly, to fill with more\r\nor less derivative pictures of their own the frame that Beethoven had\r\nbequeathed to them. But it was inevitable that a procedure of this kind\r\nshould lead here and there to the petrification of form into formalism,\r\nboth of idea and of design. For it is an error to suppose, as the\r\nwriters of text-books too often do, that 'form' is something that can\r\nbe conveyed by tuition or achieved by imitation. There is no such thing\r\nas form apart from the idea; the form _is_ simply the idea made\r\nvisible and coherent. It is not the form that shapes the thought in the\r\ntruly great masters; rather is the form simply the expression of the\r\nthought, as the form of a tree is the expression of the idea of a tree,\r\nor the form of the human body the expression of the idea of man. The\r\npost-classicists too often forgot that Beethoven's form and Beethoven's\r\nthought are inseparable--that they are, in truth, in the profoundest\r\nsense, merely different names for the same thing, the one totality\r\nviewed from different standpoints, as we may speak for convenience\r\nsake of the bodily man and the spiritual man, though, in truth, the\r\nliving man is one and indivisible; and the post-classicists, indeed,\r\nfrom Brahms downwards, founded themselves upon the early or middle\r\nBeethoven, or even his eighteenth-century predecessors, rather than\r\nupon the Beethoven of the last works, with their incessant, titanic\r\nstruggle to open new roads into art and life. With all his greatness,\r\nBrahms was not great enough to be to the symphony of his own day what\r\nBeethoven was to the symphony of his. Brahms raises an excellent crop\r\nfrom the delta fertilized by the waters of the great river as it\r\ndebouched into the unknown sea; but that was all. He himself added\r\nnothing to the soil that could make it fertile enough to support yet\r\nanother generation. All the technical mastery of Brahms--and it is very\r\ngreat indeed--cannot give to his symphonic music the thoroughly organic\r\nair of Beethoven's, the same sense of the perfect, unanalyzable fusion\r\nof form and matter.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Modern German Symphonists and Lyricists:]\r\n\r\n                 Anton Bruckner    Felix Draeseke\r\n                   Hugo Wolf        Gustav Mahler\r\n\r\nWhile Brahms was developing the classical heritage in his own way,\r\nLiszt and Wagner were boldly staking out claims on the future. With\r\neach of these composers the aim was the same--to find a form and an\r\nexpression that, by their elasticity, would make music more equal to\r\nthe painting of human life in all its manifold variety. This effort\r\ntook two lines: the instrumental and the dramatic. Liszt, anticipated\r\nto some extent by Berlioz, tried to adapt the essence of the symphonic\r\nform to the new spirit. The problems he set himself have rarely been\r\nsuccessfully solved, even to the present day; they block the path\r\nof every modern writer of symphonic poems, and of every writer of\r\nsymphonies the impulse behind which is more or less definitely poetic.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact of the incessant fluctuation of modern composers between\r\nthe two forms--the one-movement form of Liszt and the symphonic poem\r\nin general, and the four-movement form of the poetic or partly poetic\r\nsymphony--shows that neither of them is of itself completely adequate.\r\nFor against each of them strict logic can urge some pointed objection.\r\nThe four-movement form, growing as it does out of the suite, is\r\nand will always be more appropriate to what may be roughly called\r\n'pattern-music' rather than to poetic music; for the mere number of the\r\nmovements, and the practically invariable order of their succession,\r\nimplies the forcing of the thought into a preconceived frame, rather\r\nthan the determining of the frame by the nature of the picture. The\r\none-movement form is in itself more logical, but it is always faced\r\nby the problem of conciliating the natural evolution of a poetic idea\r\nand the decorative evolution of a musical pattern; and the symphonic\r\npoems in which this problem is satisfactorily solved might perhaps be\r\ncounted on the fingers of one hand. There is a point in Strauss's _Till\r\nEulenspiegel_, for example,\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: music score]\r\n\r\nin which we feel acutely that the poetic--or shall we say the\r\nnovelistic?--scheme that has so far been followed line by line is being\r\nput aside for the moment in order that the composer, having stated\r\nhis thematic material, may subject it, for purely musical reasons, to\r\nsomething in the nature of the ordinary 'working-out.'\r\n\r\nThe four-movement form obviously allows greater scope to a composer\r\nwho has a great deal to say upon a fruitful subject, but it labors\r\nunder an equally obvious disability. The modern sense of psychological\r\nunity demands that the symphony of to-day shall justify, in its own\r\nbeing, the casting of it into this or that number of movements. Every\r\nwork of art must, if challenged, be able to give an answer to what\r\nWagner used to call the question 'Why?' 'Why,' we have a right to say\r\nto the composer, 'have you chosen to give your work just this form\r\nand these dimensions and no other?' It is because modern composers\r\ncannot quite silence the voice that whispers to them that the\r\nfour-movement form is the form of the suite, in which the charm of\r\nthe music comes mainly from the delight of the purely musical faculty\r\nwith itself, rather than a form suited to a music that aims first of\r\nall at expressing more definite feelings about life, that they try to\r\nvivify the merely formal unity of the suite form with a psychological\r\nunity--mainly by means of quasi-leit-motifs that reappear in each of\r\nthe movements.\r\n\r\nBut, though this system has given us some of our finest modern works of\r\nthe symphonic type, it has its limitations. If the composer does not\r\ntell us the poetic meaning of his themes and all their reappearances,\r\nthese reappearances frequently puzzle rather than enlighten us: this is\r\nnotably the case with César Franck. If the composer works upon a single\r\nleit-motif, it is, as a rule, of the 'Fate-and-humanity' type of the\r\nTschaikowsky symphony--a type that in the end becomes rather painfully\r\nconventional. This simplicity of plan, however, has the advantage of\r\nleaving the composer free to develop his musical material with the\r\nminimum of disturbance from the poetic idea. On the other hand, if his\r\npoetic scheme is at all copious or extensive, and he allows himself to\r\nfollow all the vicissitudes of it, he must either give us a written\r\nclue to every page of his music--which he is generally unwilling\r\nand frequently unable to do--or pay the penalty of our failing to\r\nsee in his music precisely what he intended to put there; for it is\r\nas true now as when Wagner wrote, three-quarters of a century ago,\r\nthat purely instrumental music cannot permit itself such sudden and\r\nfrequent changes as dramatic music without running the risk of becoming\r\nunintelligible. Always there arises within us, when the composer's\r\nthought branches off at an angle that does not seem to us justified\r\nby the inner logic of the music _quâ_ music, that awkward question,\r\n\"Why?\" and to that question only the stage action, as Wagner says, or\r\na program, as most of us would say to-day, can supply a satisfactory\r\nanswer. This conflict between form and matter can be seen running\r\nthrough almost all modern German instrumental music of the poetic\r\norder; only the genius of Strauss has been able to resolve the antinomy\r\nwith some success. None of Beethoven's successors has been able, as he\r\nwas, to fill every bar of a symphonic composition with equal meaning,\r\nor to convey, as he did in the third symphony, the fifth and the ninth,\r\nthe sense of a drama that is implicit in the music itself, and so\r\ncoherent, so perspicuous, that words cannot add anything to it in the\r\nway of definiteness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThe symphonic work of Brahms (by which one means not merely the\r\nsymphonies but the overtures, the concertos, the chamber music and\r\nthe piano music) does, indeed, as we have seen, found itself on the\r\nmiddle rather than the later Beethoven (whereas it was from the latest\r\nBeethoven that Wagner drew _his_ chief nourishment); but in spite of\r\na certain timidity and a certain rigidity of form, Brahms's profound\r\nnature and his consummate workmanship give his work an individuality\r\nthat enables him to stand by the side of Beethoven, though he never\r\nreaches quite to Beethoven's height. The other exploiters of the\r\nclassical heritage have less individuality. They aim at breaking no new\r\nground; they are content to till afresh the soil that the classical\r\nmasters have fertilized for them.\r\n\r\nMax Bruch may be taken as the type of a whole crowd of these\r\npost-classical writers. Their virtues are those that are always\r\ncharacteristic of the epigone. There is in art, as in the animal world,\r\na protective mimicry that enables certain weaker species to assume\r\nat any rate the external markings of more vigorous organisms than\r\nthemselves. In music, minds of this order clothe themselves with the\r\nqualities that lie on the surface of the great men's work. Their own\r\nart is parasitic (one uses that term, of course, without any offensive\r\nintention, with a biological, not a moral, implication). The parasitic\r\norganism lives easily in virtue of the fact that the parent organism\r\nundertakes all the labor of the chief vital functions. The epigone\r\nmanipulates again and again the forms of his great predecessors. The\r\nsubstance he pours into these molds is hardly more his own. Yet work of\r\nthis kind can have undeniable charm; after all, it is better for a man\r\nwhose strength is not of the first order to live contentedly upon the\r\nside of the great mountain than to court destruction by trying to scale\r\nits dizziest peaks. The work of these epigones always has the balance\r\nand the clarity that come from the complete absence of any sense of a\r\nnew problem to beat their heads against.\r\n\r\nMax Bruch was born in 1838 and evinced the early precocity of genius;\r\nhe had a symphony performed in his native Cologne at the age of\r\nfourteen. As a beneficiary of the Mozart Foundation he became a pupil\r\nof Ferdinand Hiller in composition and of Carl Reinecke and Ferdinand\r\nBreuning in piano. As executive musician he has had a brilliant career.\r\nAfter teaching in Cologne he became successively musical director in\r\nCoblentz, court kapellmeister in Sondershausen, chorus conductor in\r\nBerlin (_Sternscher Gesangverein_), conductor of the Philharmonic\r\nSociety of Liverpool, England, and the _Orchesterverein_ of Breslau.\r\nIn 1891 he became head of the 'master school' of composition in the\r\nBerlin Academy, was given the title of professor, received in 1893\r\nthe honorary degree of Doc. Mus. from Cambridge, and in 1898 became a\r\ncorresponding member of the French Academy of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nHis most important creative work is unquestionably represented by\r\nhis large choral works with orchestra. Together with Georg Vierling\r\n(1820-1901) he may be credited with the modern revival of the secular\r\ncantata. _Frithjof_, op. 23 (1864), written during his stay in Mannheim\r\n(1862-64), was the foundation-stone of his reputation, followed soon\r\nafter by the universally known 'Fair Ellen,' op. 25, and later by\r\n_Odysseus_, op. 41 (1873), _Arminius_, op. 43, 'The Song of the Bell,'\r\nop. 45, 'The Cross of Fire,' op. 52, all for mixed chorus. There\r\nis a sacred oratorio, 'Moses,' op. 52, and a secular one 'Gustavus\r\nAdolphus,' op. 73, and a large number of other choral works for mixed,\r\nmale and female chorus. His operas, 'Lorelei' (1863) and 'Hermione'\r\nop. 40, had only a _succès d'estime_. The first violin concerto, in\r\nG minor, op. 26, is perhaps Bruch's most famous composition, and a\r\ngrateful constituent of every violinist's repertoire. There are two\r\nother violin concertos (both in D minor), opera 44 and 45, a Romance, a\r\nFantasia and other violin pieces with orchestra, also works for 'cello\r\nand orchestra, including the well-known setting of _Kol Nidrei_.\r\nThree symphonies (E-flat minor, F minor and E major), op. 28, 36 and\r\n51; a few chamber music and piano pieces complete the catalogue of his\r\nworks. Bruch's idiom is frankly melodic, though his harmonic texture\r\nis quite rich and his counterpoint varied. Formally he is conservative\r\nand, all in all, he imposes no strain upon the listener's power of\r\ncomprehension. His music is solid and grateful, but not of striking\r\noriginality. Through his masters, Reinecke and Hiller, he represents\r\nthe Schumann-Mendelssohn tradition in a vigorous though inoffensive\r\neclecticism.\r\n\r\nThe leading members of this order of composers in the Germany of the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century besides Bruch, were Hermann Goetz\r\n(1840-1876; symphony in F major), Friedrich Gernsheim (born 1839;\r\nfour symphonies and much chamber music), Heinrich von Herzogenberg\r\n(1843-1900; chamber music, church music, symphonies, etc.), Joseph\r\nRheinberger (1839-1901); Wilhelm Berger (1861-1911; works for choir and\r\norchestra, chamber music, two symphonies, etc.); and Georg Schumann\r\n(1866; orchestral and choral works, chamber music, etc).\r\n\r\nGoetz is best known for his work in the operatic field and may be more\r\nappropriately treated in that connection (see p. 245). Gernsheim,\r\na native of Worms, was a student in the Leipzig conservatory and\r\nbroadened his education by a sojourn in Paris (from 1855). The\r\nposts of musical director in Saarbrücken (1861), teacher of piano\r\nand composition at the Cologne conservatory (1865), conductor of\r\nthe Maatschappig concerts in Rotterdam (1874) successively engaged\r\nhis activities. From 1890-97 he taught at the Stern conservatory in\r\nBerlin and conducted the _Sternsche Gesangverein_ till 1904, besides\r\nthe _Eruditio musica_ of Rotterdam. In 1901 he became principal of\r\na master-school for composition. Since 1897 Gernsheim has been a\r\nmember of the senate of the Royal Academy. Similar to Bruch in his\r\ntendencies, Gernsheim has composed, aside from the instrumental works\r\nmentioned above, a number of choral works of which _Salamis_, _Odin's\r\nMeeresritt_ (both for men's chorus, baritone and orchestra) and _Das\r\nGrab im Busento_ (men's chorus and orchestra) are especially notable.\r\nOvertures and a concerto each for piano, for violin, and for 'cello\r\nmust be added to complete the list of his works.\r\n\r\nHeinrich von Herzogenberg, too, is chiefly identified with the revival\r\nof choral song, especially of ecclesiastical character (a Requiem, op.\r\n72; a mass, op. 87; _Totenfeier_, op. 80; 'The Birth of Christ,' op.\r\n90; a Passion, op. 93, etc.). In this department Herzogenberg is the\r\nsuccessor to Friedrich Kiel.\r\n\r\nRheinberger occupies a peculiar position. He is a stanch adherent\r\nto classical traditions and generally considered as an academic\r\ncomposer. That his classicism was not inconsistent with a hankering\r\nafter the methods of the New German School, however, is shown in his\r\nWallenstein symphony (op. 10) and his 'Christophorus' (oratorio).\r\nHaving received his early training upon the organ, he has shown a\r\npreponderant tendency toward organ music and ecclesiastical composition\r\nin general. Nevertheless he has written, besides the works already\r\nnamed, a symphonic fantasy, three overtures, and considerable piano and\r\nchamber works. Eugen Schmitz[31] calls him a South German Raff, for\r\n'as many-sided as Raff, he, in contrast to this master of North German\r\ntraining, received his musical education in South Germany.' (Born in\r\nVaduz, in Lichtenstein, he continued his training in Feldkirch and\r\nduring 1851-54 at the Royal School of Music in Munich). In Munich he\r\nbecame the centre of a veritable school of young composers, exerting\r\na very broad influence, first as teacher of theory and later royal\r\nprofessor and inspector of the Royal School. Rheinberger also conducted\r\nthe performances of the Royal Chapel choir. He received the honorary\r\ndegree of Ph.D. from the University of Munich and became a member of\r\nthe Berlin Academy.\r\n\r\nRiemann's judgment of his merit, voiced in the following sentences, may\r\nbe taken as just on the whole. He says: 'Rheinberger enjoyed a high\r\nreputation as composer, in the vocal as well as in the instrumental\r\nfield. However, the contrapuntal mastery and the æsthetic instinct\r\nevident in his workmanship cannot permanently hide his lack of really\r\nwarm-blooded emotion.' His organ works, of classic perfection, will\r\nprobably last the longest. His _Requiem_, _Stabat Mater_, and a\r\ndouble-choir Mass stand at the head of his church compositions. He\r\nalso wrote an opera, _Die Sieben Raben_. Like Bruch's, his style is\r\neclectic, being a fusion of neo-classical and post-romantic influences.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Berger is a native of America (Boston, 1861), but was educated\r\nin Berlin, where he was a pupil of Fr. Kiel at the Royal _Hochschule_.\r\nLater he became teacher at the Klindworth-Scharwenka conservatory and\r\nin 1903 succeeded Fritz Steinbach as conductor of the famous Meiningen\r\ncourt orchestra. Some of his songs are widely known, but his choral\r\ncompositions (_Totentanz_, _Euphorin_, etc.) constitute his most\r\nimportant work. Berger is a Brahms disciple without reserve, and so\r\nare Hans Kössler (b. 1853, symphonic variations for orchestra, etc.),\r\nFriedrich E. Koch (b. 1862, symphonic fugue in C minor, oratorio\r\n_Von den Tageszeiten_, etc.), Gustav Schreck (b. 1849), and Max\r\nZenger (b. 1837). Georg Schumann, the last on our list of important\r\nepigones, has had more hearings abroad than most of his contemporary\r\nbrothers-in-faith, especially with his oratorio 'Ruth' (1908), several\r\ntimes performed by the New York Oratorio Society. As conductor of the\r\nBerlin _Singakademie_ (since 1900), he has not lacked incentive to\r\nchoral writing, hence 'Amor and Psyche,' _Preis und Danklied_, etc. A\r\nsymphony in B, a serenade, op. 32, and other orchestral pieces as well\r\nas chamber works have come from his pen, all in the Brahms idiom.\r\n\r\nThe names of the still smaller men are legion. Let us mention but a few\r\nof them: Robert Radecke (1830-1911) wrote a symphony, overtures, and\r\nchoral songs; Johann Herbeck (1831-77), symphonies, etc.; Joseph Abert\r\n(b. 1832), besides operas a symphony, a symphonic poem, 'Columbus,' and\r\novertures; Albert Becker (1834-99), a Mass in B minor, a prize-crowned\r\nsymphony, choral and chamber works; Franz Wüllner (1832-1902), chiefly\r\nchoral works; Heinrich Hofmann (1842-1902), besides the operas _Armin_\r\nand _Ännchen von Tharau_, a symphony, orchestral suites, cantatas,\r\nchamber music and piano music, much of it for four hands; and Franz\r\nRies (b. 1846), suites for violin and piano, string quartets, etc.\r\nGeorg Henschel is especially noted for his songs (see Vol. V); Hans\r\nHuber, a German Swiss, for his 'Böcklin Symphony' and chamber music;\r\nwhile the Germanized Poles Maurice Moszkowski (b. 1854) and the\r\nbrothers Scharwenka (Philipp and Xaver, b. 1850) claim attention with\r\npleasing and popular piano pieces. Needless to say, such a list as this\r\ncan never be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nSide by side with the neo-classical school, but always steadily\r\nencroaching upon it, is the 'poetic' school that derives from Liszt and\r\nWagner. It is a truism of criticism that in musical history the big\r\nmen end periods rather than begin them. The composer who inaugurates\r\na movement appears to posterity as a fumbler rather than a master,\r\nand even in his own day his methods and his ideals fail to command\r\ngeneral respect, so wide a gulf is there in them between intention and\r\nachievement. It was so, for example, with Liszt and his immediate\r\nschool. But in the end there comes a man who, with a greater natural\r\ngenius than his predecessors, assimilates all they have to teach him\r\neither imaginatively or formally, and brings to fulfillment what in\r\nthem was at its best never more than promise. The tentative work of\r\nLiszt comes to full fruition in the work of Strauss. He has a richer\r\nmusical endowment than any of his predecessors in his own special\r\nline, and a technical skill to which none of them could ever pretend.\r\nLiszt had imagination, but he never succeeded in making a thoroughly\r\nserviceable technique for himself, no doubt because his early career as\r\na pianist made it impossible for him to work seriously at composition\r\nuntil comparatively late in life. Strauss is of the type of musician\r\nwho readily learns all that the pedagogues can teach him, and utilizes\r\nthe knowledge thus acquired as the basis for a new technique of his own.\r\n\r\nRichard Strauss was born June 11, 1864, in Munich, the son of Franz\r\nStrauss, a noted Waldhorn player (royal chamber musician). He studied\r\ncomposition with the local court kapellmeister, W. Meyer, and as early\r\nas 1881 gave striking evidence of his talent in a string quartet in\r\nA minor (op. 2), which was played by the Walter quartet. A Symphony\r\nin D minor, an overture in C minor and a suite for thirteen wind\r\ninstruments, op. 7, all performed in public, the last by the famous\r\n'Meininger' orchestra, quickly spread his name among musicians and in\r\n1885 he was engaged by Hans von Bülow as musical director to the ducal\r\ncourt at Meiningen. Here Alexander Ritter is said to have influenced\r\nhim in the direction of ultra-modernity. After another year Strauss\r\nreturned to Munich as third royal kapellmeister; three years later\r\n(1889) he became Lassen's associate as court conductor in Weimar; from\r\n1894 to 1898 he was again in Munich, this time as court conductor,\r\nand at the end of that period went to Berlin to occupy a similar\r\npost at the Royal Prussian court. In 1904 he became general musical\r\ndirector (_Generalmusikdirektor_). Since the appearance of his first\r\nworks mentioned above he has been almost incessantly occupied with\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThese early works and those immediately following give little hint\r\nof the later Strauss, except for the characteristically hard-hitting\r\nstrength of it almost from the first. Works like the B minor piano\r\nsonata (op. 5) and the 'cello sonata (op. 6), for example, have a\r\ncurious, cubbish demonstrativeness about them; but it is plain enough\r\nalready that the cub is of the great breed. With the exception of a\r\nfew songs, and a setting of Goethe's _Wanderers Sturmlied_ for chorus\r\nand orchestra (op. 14), all his music until his twenty-second year was\r\nin the traditional instrumental forms; it includes, besides the works\r\nalready mentioned, a string quartet (op. 2), a violin concerto (op.\r\n8), a symphony (op. 12), a quartet for piano and strings (op. 13), a\r\n_Burleske_ for piano and orchestra, and sundry smaller works for piano\r\nsolo, etc. According to his own account, he was first set upon the path\r\nof poetic music by Alexander Ritter--a man of no great account as a\r\ncomposer, but restlessly alive to the newest musical currents of his\r\ntime, and with the literary gift of rousing enthusiasm in others for\r\nhis own ideas. He was an ardent partisan of the 'New German' school of\r\nLiszt and Wagner. Of his own essays in the operatic field only two saw\r\ncompletion: _Der faule Hans_ (1885) and _Wem die Krone?_ (1890). They\r\nwere mildly successful in Munich and Weimar. Besides these he wrote\r\nsymphonic poems that at least partially bridge the gap between Liszt\r\nand Strauss; 'Seraphic Phantasy,' 'Erotic Legend,' 'Olaf's Wedding\r\nProcession,' and 'Emperor Rudolph's Ride to the Grave' are some of the\r\ntitles. Ritter was of Russian birth (Narva), but lived in Germany from\r\nchildhood (Dresden, Leipzig, Weimar, Würzberg, etc). He was a close\r\nfriend of Bülow and married Wagner's niece, Franziska Wagner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Richard Strauss]\r\n                   _After a crayon by Faragò (1905)_\r\n\r\nThe first-fruits of Ritter's influence upon Strauss were the symphonic\r\nfantasia _Aus Italien_ (1886). The young revolutionary as yet moves\r\nwith a certain amount of circumspection. The new work is poetic,\r\nprogrammatic, but it is cast in the conventional four-movement form,\r\nthe separate movements corresponding roughly to those of the ordinary\r\nsymphony. It is obviously a 'prentice work,’ but it is of significance\r\nin Strauss's history for a warmth of emotion that had been only rarely\r\nperceptible in his earlier music. Here and there it has the rude,\r\nknockabout sort of energy that was noticeable in some of the earlier\r\nworks, and that in the later works was to degenerate into a mere noisy\r\nslamming about of commonplaces; but it also shows much poetic feeling,\r\nand in particular an ardent romantic appreciation of nature.\r\n\r\n_Aus Italien_ was followed by a series of remarkable tone-poems--_Don\r\nJuan_ (op. 20, 1888), _Macbeth_ (op. 23, written 1886-7 but not\r\npublished until after the _Don Juan_), _Till Eulenspiegels lustige\r\nStreiche_ (op. 28, 1894-95), _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (op. 30,\r\n1894-95), _Don Quixote_ (op. 39, 1897), _Ein Heldenleben_ (op.\r\n40, 1898), and the _Symphonia Domestica_ (op. 53, 1903). With the\r\nlast-named work Strauss bade farewell to the concert room for many\r\nyears, the next stage of his development being worked out in the opera\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe forms, no less than the titles, of the orchestral works, reveal\r\nthe many-sidedness of Strauss's mind, the keenness of his interest in\r\nlife and literary art, the individuality of the point of view from\r\nwhich he regards each of his subjects, and the peculiarly logical\r\nmedium he adopts for the expression of each of them. Bound up with this\r\nadaptability are a certain restlessness that drives him on to abandon\r\nevery field in turn before he has developed all the possibilities of\r\nit, and a certain anxiety to 'hit the public between the eyes' each\r\ntime that gives him now and then the appearance of exploiting new\r\nsensations for new sensations' sake. It is perhaps not doing him any\r\ninjustice, for instance, to suppose that a very keen finger upon the\r\npublic pulse warned him that it would be unwise to bombard it with\r\nanother blood-and-lust drama of the type of _Salome_ and _Elektra_;\r\nso, with an admirably sure instinct, he relaxes into the broad comedy\r\nof _Der Rosenkavalier_. Feeling after this that the public wanted\r\nsomething newer still, he tried, in _Ariadne auf Naxos_, to combine\r\ndrama and opera in the one work. Then, realizing from the Western\r\nEuropean successes of the Russians that ballet is likely to become the\r\norder of the day, he tries his hand at a modified form of this in 'The\r\nLegend of Joseph.'\r\n\r\nWhat in the later works has become, however, almost as much a\r\ncommercial as an artistic impulse, was in the early years the genuine\r\nquick-change of a very fertile, eager spirit, with extraordinary powers\r\nof poetic and graphic expression in music. Strauss, like Wagner, is a\r\nmusical architect by instinct; he can plan big edifices and realize\r\nthem. The sureness of this instinct is incidentally shown by the varied\r\nforms of these early and middle-period orchestral works of his. As we\r\nhave seen, the writer of symphonic poems is always confronted by the\r\nserious problem of harmonizing a poetic with a musical development;\r\nand in practice we find that, as a rule, either the following of the\r\nliterary idea destroys the purely musical logic of the work, or, in\r\nhis anxiety to preserve a formal logic in his music, the composer has\r\nto impair the simplicity or the continuity of the poetic scheme, as\r\nStrauss has had to do in the passage in _Till Eulenspiegel_, already\r\ncited. But, on the whole, Strauss has come much nearer than any\r\nother composer to solving the problem of combined poetic and musical\r\nform in instrumental music. In _Macbeth_ he has 'internalized' the\r\ndramatic action in a very remarkable way--a procedure he might have\r\nadopted with advantage on other occasions. Here, where there was every\r\ntemptation to the superficially effective painting of externalities,\r\nhe has dissolved the pictorial and episodical into the psychological,\r\nmaking Macbeth's own soul the centre of all the dramatic storm and\r\nstress, and so allowing full scope for the purely expressive power of\r\nmusic. In _Don Juan_ the form is rightly quasi-symphonic--a group of\r\nworkable main themes representing the hero, with a group of subsidiary\r\nthemes suggestive of the minor characters that cross his path and\r\nthe circumstances under which he meets with them. The tissue is not\r\nwoven throughout with absolute continuity, but the form as a whole is\r\nlucid and coherent. The episodical adventures of _Till Eulenspiegel_\r\ncould find no better musical frame than the rondo form that Strauss\r\nhas chosen for them; while the variation form is most suited to the\r\nfigures, the adventures, and the psychology of Don Quixote and Sancho\r\nPanza. In the _Symphonia Domestica_ the number and relationship of\r\nthe characters, and the incidents that make up the domestic day, are\r\nbest treated in a form that is virtually that of the ordinary symphony\r\ncompressed into a single movement. A similar congruity between form and\r\nmatter will be found in _Also sprach Zarathustra_ and _Ein Heldenleben_.\r\n\r\nThis fertility of form was only the outward and visible sign of an\r\nextraordinary fertility of conception. No other composer, before or\r\nsince, has poured such a wealth of thinking into program music, created\r\nso many poetic-musical types, or depicted their _milieu_ with such\r\ngraphic power. Each new work, dealing as it did with new characters\r\nand new scenes, spontaneously found for itself a new idiom, melodic,\r\nharmonic and rhythmic; in this unconscious transformation of his speech\r\nin accordance with the inward vision Strauss resembles Wagner and Hugo\r\nWolf. The immense energy of the mind is shown not only in the range\r\nand variety of its psychology, but physically, as it were, in the wide\r\ntrajectory of the melodies, the powerful gestures of the rhythms that\r\nsometimes, indeed, become almost convulsive--and the long-breathed\r\nphraseology of passages like the opening section of _Ein Heldenleben_.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps inevitable that this extraordinary energy should\r\noccasionally get out of hand and degenerate into a sort of\r\n_Unbändigkeit_. Strauss is at once a man of genius and an irresponsible\r\nstreet urchin. With all his gifts, something that goes to the making\r\nof the artist of the very greatest kind is lacking in him. He has a\r\ngiant span of conception that is rare in music; but he seems to take a\r\npleasure in constructing gigantic edifices only to spoil them for the\r\nadmiring spectator by scrawling a fatuity or an obscenity across the\r\nfront of them. He can be, at times, unaccountably perverse, malicious,\r\nchildish towards his own creations. This element in him, or rather\r\nthe seeds from which it has developed, first become clearly visible\r\nin _Till Eulenspiegel_. There, however, it remains pure _gaminerie_;\r\nit does not clash with the nature of the subject, and the jovial,\r\nyouthful spirits and the happy inventiveness of the composer carry it\r\noff. But afterwards it often assumes an unpleasant form. There are one\r\nor two things in _Don Quixote_ that amuse us a little at first but\r\nafterwards become rather tiresome, as over-insistence on the purely\r\nphysical grotesque always does in time. In _Ein Heldenleben_ a drama\r\nthat is mostly worked out on a high spiritual plane is vulgarized by\r\nthe crude physical horror of the brutal battle scene, and by the now\r\nwell-nigh pointless humor of the ugly 'Adversaries' section. There\r\nare pettinesses and sillinesses in the _Symphonia Domestica_ that one\r\ncan hardly understand a man of Strauss's eminence troubling to put on\r\npaper. Altogether, we may say of the Strauss of the instrumental works\r\nalone--we can certainly say it of the later Strauss of the operas--that\r\nhe is, in Romain Rolland's phrase, a curious compound of 'mud, débris,\r\nand genius.' Always he is a spirit at war with itself; sometimes he\r\nseems cursed, like an obverse of Goethe's Mephistopheles, to will the\r\ngood and work the ill. But he has enriched program music with a large\r\nfund of new ideas, and given it a new direction and a new technique. He\r\nhas established, more thoroughly than any other composer, the right of\r\npoetic instrumental music to a place by the side of abstract music. He\r\nhas attempted things that were thought impossible in music, sometimes\r\nfailing, but more often than not succeeding extraordinarily.\r\n\r\nHis workmanship is equal to his invention; of him at any rate the\r\npost-classicists can never say, as they said half a century ago of\r\nLiszt and his school, that he writes literary music because he lacks\r\nthe self-discipline and the skill necessary for success in the abstract\r\nforms. If anything his technique, especially his orchestral technique,\r\nis too astounding; it tempts him to do amazing but unnecessary things\r\nfor the mere sake of doing them. But with all his faults he is a\r\ncolossus of sorts; he bestrides modern German music as Wagner did that\r\nof half a century ago. In wealth and variety of emotion and in power of\r\ngraphic utterance his work as a whole is beyond comparison with that of\r\nany other contemporary composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nThe life of Strauss overlaps that of his great post-classical\r\nantithesis Brahms by thirty-three years, and by thirty-six years that\r\nof Anton Bruckner (1824-1896), a symphonist who is still little known,\r\nand that for two reasons. In the first place, his works are as a rule\r\nexcessively long; in the second place, he had the misfortune to live\r\nin Vienna, where the Brahms partisans were at one time all-powerful.\r\nSome of them resented the pretensions of another symphonist to\r\ncomparison with their own idol, and by innuendo and neglect, rather\r\nthan by direct attack, they contrived to diffuse a legend that has\r\nmaintained itself almost down to our own day, that Bruckner was merely\r\nan amiable old gentleman with a passion for writing symphonies, but\r\none who need not be taken too seriously. As a matter of fact, he was\r\na good deal more than that. There is no necessity to flaunt a defiant\r\nBrucknerian banner in the face of the Brahmsians, but there is every\r\nnecessity to say that great as Brahms was he by no means exhausted\r\nthe possibilities of the modern symphony, and that several of the\r\npossibilities that he left untouched were turned to excellent use by\r\nBruckner.\r\n\r\nBruckner's life was remarkably circumscribed and offers practically\r\nno interest to a biographer. The son of a country schoolmaster in\r\nAnsfelden, Upper Austria (where he was born Sept. 4, 1824), he\r\nspent his early life following in his father's footsteps, first at\r\nWindhag (near Freistadt), later at St. Florian, where he also filled\r\na temporary post as organist. By his own efforts he became highly\r\nproficient on that instrument and in counterpoint. This fact and his\r\nconstant connection with the church influenced his creative work\r\nstrongly. In 1855 he became cathedral organist at Linz, meantime\r\nstudying counterpoint with Sechter in Vienna, where he later (1867)\r\nbecame his master's successor as court organist. He also studied\r\ncomposition with Otto Kitzler in 1861-63. Aside from his activities\r\nas professor of organ, counterpoint and composition at the Vienna\r\nConservatory and as lecturer on music at the Vienna University, this\r\nconstitutes the outward record of his career. He died in Vienna, Oct.\r\n11, 1896.\r\n\r\nSimilarly devoid of variety in their classification are his\r\ncompositions--besides his nine symphonies, upon which his reputation\r\nrests, there are only three masses (D minor, 1864; E minor, 1869; F\r\nminor, 1872) and a few more sacred works (including the '150th Psalm');\r\nfour compositions for men's chorus accompanied (_Germanenzug_ and\r\n_Helgoland_, with orchestra; _Das hohe Lied_ and _Mitternacht_, with\r\npiano); some others _a cappella_, and one string quartet. Mostly works\r\nof large calibre and commensurately broad in conception.\r\n\r\nThe error is still frequently made--it was an error that did him\r\nmuch harm in anti-Wagnerian Vienna during his lifetime--of regarding\r\nBruckner as one who tried to translate Wagner into terms of the\r\nsymphony. For Wagner, indeed, he had a passionate admiration; but his\r\nown affinities as a composer with Wagner are so trifling as to be\r\nnegligible. The real heirs of Wagner are the men who, like Strauss,\r\naim at making purely instrumental music a vehicle for the expression\r\nof definite poetic ideas--whose symphonic poems are really operas\r\nwithout words, with the orchestra as the actors. Bruckner, even with\r\nLiszt's example before him, passed the symphonic poem by on the other\r\nside. His nine symphonies are almost as purely 'abstract' music as\r\nthose of Brahms; if one qualifies the comparison with an 'almost' it\r\nis not because Bruckner worked upon anything even remotely resembling\r\na program, but because the rather sudden transitions here and there\r\nin the symphonies, lacking as they do a strictly logical musical\r\nconnection, are apt to suggest that the composer had in his mind some\r\nmore or less definite extra-musical symbol. But this explanation of\r\nthe undeniable fact that there is more than one hiatus in the Bruckner\r\nmovements, though it is not an impossible one, is not the most probable\r\none in every case.\r\n\r\nA certain disconnectedness was almost inevitable in such a symphonic\r\nmethod as that of Bruckner. He had no appetite for the merely formal\r\n'working-out' that Brahms could manipulate with such facility, but\r\nfrequently without convincing us that he is saying anything very\r\ngermane to his main topic. For a frank recognition of Brahms' general\r\nmastery of form is not incompatible with an equally frank recognition\r\nthat too often formalism was master of him. The danger of a transmitted\r\nclassical technique in any art is that now and then it tempts its\r\npractitioners to talk--and allows them to talk quite fluently--when\r\nthey have really nothing of vital importance to say. Take, as an\r\nexample, bars 58-73 of the first movement of Brahms' fourth symphony.\r\nThis passage is not merely dull; it is absolutely meaningless. It\r\ncarries the immediately preceding thought no further; it is no manner\r\nof necessary preparation for the thought that comes immediately after.\r\nIt is 'padding' pure and simple; a mechanical manipulation of the clay\r\nwithout any clear idea on the part of the potter as to what he wishes\r\nto model. Brahms, in fact, knows, or half-knows, that he has travelled\r\nas far as he can go along one road, and has a little time to wait\r\nbefore etiquette permits him to proceed up another: so he marks time\r\nwith the best grace he can--or, to vary the illustration, having said\r\nall he can think of in connection with A, and not being due just yet to\r\ndiscuss B, he simply goes on talking until he can think of something to\r\nsay. Such a passage as this would have been impossible for Beethoven:\r\nhis rigorously logical mind would have rejected it as being a mere\r\ninorganic patch upon the flesh of a living organism: he would never\r\nhave rested until he had re-established the momentarily interrupted\r\nflow of vital blood between the severed parts.\r\n\r\nFor a mechanical technique such as Brahms uses here, Bruckner had no\r\nliking, nor would it have been of much use in connection with ideas\r\nlike his. In his general attitude towards the symphony he reminds us\r\nsomewhat of Schubert. He does not start, as Brahms does, with a subject\r\nthat, however admirable it may be in itself, and however excellently\r\nit may be adapted for the germination of fresh matter from it, has\r\nobviously been chosen in some degree because of its 'workableness.'\r\nWith Bruckner, as with Schubert, the subject sings out at once simply\r\nbecause it must. The composer is too full of the immediate warmth of\r\nthe idea to premeditate 'development' of it. So it inevitably comes\r\nabout that, with both Bruckner and Schubert, repetition takes, in some\r\ndegree, the place of development. Symphonic development, speaking\r\nbroadly, becomes technically easier in proportion as the thematic\r\nmatter to be manipulated is shorter; looking at the music for the\r\nmoment as a mere piece of tissue-weaving, it is evident that more\r\npermutations and combinations can easily be made out of a theme like\r\nthat of the first subject of Beethoven's fifth symphony than out of the\r\nmain theme of Liszt's _Tasso_, or the Francesca theme in Tschaikowsky's\r\n_Francesca da Rimini_. Wagner, with his keen symphonic sense, gradually\r\nrealized this; whereas the leit-motifs of his early works are, as\r\na rule, fairly lengthy melodies, those of his later works are of a\r\npregnant brevity. The reason for this change of style was that, as he\r\ncame to see more and more clearly the possibilities of a symphonic\r\ndevelopment of the orchestral voice in opera, he saw also that the\r\ninterweaving of themes would be at once closer and more elastic if the\r\nmotifs themselves were made shorter.\r\n\r\nThis generic musical fact is the explanation of much of the formal\r\nunsatisfactoriness of the average symphonic poem. If the object of the\r\npoetic musician is to depict a character, he will need a fairly wide\r\nsweep of melodic outline. We could not, for example, suggest Hamlet or\r\nFaust in a theme so short and simple as that of the first subject of\r\nthe _Eroica_, or the first subject of the Second Symphony of Brahms--to\r\nsay nothing of the 'Fate' theme of Beethoven's Fifth. But the\r\nwide-stretching poetic theme pays for its psychological suggestiveness\r\nby sacrificing, in most cases, its 'workableness.' And composers have\r\nonly latterly learned how to overcome this disability by constructing\r\nthe big, character-drawing theme on a sort of fishing-rod principle,\r\nwith detachable parts. It takes Strauss nearly one hundred and twenty\r\nbars in which to draw the full portrait of his hero in the splendid\r\nopening section of _Ein Heldenleben_; but various pieces of the chief\r\ntheme can be used at will later so as to suggest some transformation\r\nof mood in the hero, or some change in his circumstances. The curious\r\nfalling figure in the third bar of the work, for example, that at\r\nfirst conveys an idea of headlong energy, afterwards becomes a roar of\r\npain and rage (full score, pp. 118 ff, and elsewhere). Had Liszt had\r\nthe imagination to hit upon such a device as this, and the technique\r\nto manipulate it, he might have given to the 'development' of his\r\nsymphonic poems something of the organic life that Strauss has infused\r\ninto his.\r\n\r\nBruckner also lacked, in the main, this knowledge of how to work upon\r\nsweeping ideas that were conceived primarily for purely expressive\r\nrather than 'developmental' purposes, and at the same time to make\r\neither the whole theme or various fragments of it plastic factors in\r\nthe evolution of an organically-knit texture. If Brahms would have been\r\nnone the worse for a little of that quality in Bruckner that made it\r\nimpossible for him to talk unless he had something to say, Bruckner\r\nwould have been all the better for a little of Brahms' gift of making\r\nthe most of whatever fragment of material he was using at the moment.\r\nWhen Bruckner attempts 'development' in the scholastic sense, as in\r\nbars 300 ff of the first movement of the third symphony, he is almost\r\nalways awkward and unconvincing. His logic--and a logic of his own he\r\ncertainly had--was less formal than poetic; as one gets to know the\r\nsymphonies better one is surprised to find emotional continuity coming\r\ninto many a passage that had previously appeared a trifle incoherent.\r\nHis musical logic is just the logic of any true and spontaneous thing\r\nsaid simply, naturally and feelingly.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true in one sense that Bruckner's methods and outlook\r\nremained the same in each of his nine published symphonies (the ninth,\r\nby the way, was left uncompleted at his death), in another sense it\r\nputs a false complexion on the truth. We do not find in him any such\r\ngrowth--discernible in the texture not less than in the manner--as\r\nwe do from the First Symphony to the Ninth of Beethoven, or from\r\nthe _Rienzi_ to the _Parsifal_ of Wagner. In externals, and to some\r\nextent in essentials also, Bruckner's method and manner are the\r\nsame throughout his life--the wide-spun imaginative first movement,\r\nthe thoughtful _adagio_, the wild or merry _scherzo_, the rather\r\nsprawling _finale_. But there was a real evolution of the intensive\r\nkind; and in the last three symphonies in particular everything has\r\nbecome enormously _vertieft_. In the ninth, Bruckner often attains to\r\na Beethovenian profundity and pregnancy. His greatest fault is his\r\ninability to concentrate: his material is almost invariably excellent,\r\nbut he is too prodigal with it. He is not content with two or three\r\nmain ideas, that in themselves would constitute material enough for\r\na movement; to these he needs to add episodes of all kinds, until\r\nthe movement expands to a size that makes listening to it a physical\r\nstrain, and renders it difficult for the mind to grasp the true\r\nproportions of it. This is generally the case with his first and last\r\nmovements; not even the titanic power of conception in movements like\r\nthe finale of his fifth and eighth symphonies, nor the extraordinary\r\ntechnical mastery they show, can quite reconcile us to their length\r\nand apparent diffuseness. His most expressive work is frequently to\r\nbe found in his adagios, though there, too, his method is at times so\r\nleisurely that in spite of the fine quality of the material and the\r\ndepth of feeling in the music, it is sometimes hard to maintain one's\r\ninterest in it to the end. In his _scherzi_ he is more conciliatory to\r\nthe average listener. Here he is incontestably nearer to Beethoven than\r\nBrahms ever came in movements of this type. In place of the charming\r\nbut rather irrelevant quasi-pastorals with which Brahms is content for\r\nthe scherzi of his symphonies, Bruckner writes movements overflowing\r\nwith vitality, a veritable riot of rhythmic energy. He will never be\r\npopular in the concert room; his excessive length and his frequent\r\ndiffuseness are against that. But to musicians he will always be one of\r\nthe most interesting figures in nineteenth-century music--a composer\r\nfertile in ideas of a noble kind, an imaginative artist with the power\r\nof evoking moods of a refined and moving poetry. And certainly there\r\nis no contrast more remarkable in the whole history of music than that\r\nbetween the quiet, embarrassed, unlettered recluse that was the man\r\nBruckner, and the volcano of passion that was the musician. Undoubtedly\r\nhe has the great hand, and at times he can shake the world with it as\r\nBeethoven did with his. His place is between Beethoven and Schubert:\r\nwith each of his hands he holds a hand of theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nThe third big figure among the representatives of the modern 'poetic'\r\nschool is Gustav Mahler. Like the other two, he is of the 'southern\r\nwing'; like Bruckner's, his training was Viennese. Born in Kalischt\r\n(Bohemia), he went to the capital as a student in the university and\r\nthe conservatory. Already at twenty he began that brilliant career\r\nas conductor which during his lifetime somewhat overshadowed his\r\nrecognition as a creative artist. His first post was at Hall (Upper\r\nAustria), where he conducted a theatre orchestra; thence he\r\nwent to Laibach, Olmütz, Kassel (as _Vereinsdirigent_); thence to\r\nPrague as conductor of the German National Theatre (1885). In 1886 he\r\nsubstituted for Nikisch at the Leipzig opera; two years later he became\r\nopera conductor in Budapest, 1891 in Hamburg, and 1897 returned to\r\nVienna, first as conductor, soon after to become director of the Royal\r\nOpera, where he remained till 1907. During 1898-1900 he conducted the\r\nPhilharmonic concerts as well. In 1909 he came to New York as conductor\r\nof the Philharmonic Society and remained till 1911, when failing\r\nhealth, perhaps aggravated by uncongenial conditions, forced him to\r\nresign. He died shortly after his return to Vienna, in the same year.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: Max Reger]\r\n                    _After a photograph from life_\r\n\r\nWhile still in his youth Mahler wrote an opera, 'The Argonauts,'\r\nbesides songs and chamber music. A musical 'fairy play,' _Rübezahl_,\r\nwith text by himself, the _Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen_, and nine\r\nsymphonies, designed on a gigantic scale, constitute the bulk of his\r\nmature works. Other songs, a choral work with orchestra (_Das klagende\r\nLied_), and the 'Humoresques' for orchestra nearly complete the list.\r\n\r\nBruckner left the problem of modern symphonic form unsolved. Brahms\r\npartly solved it in one way, by following the classical tradition on\r\nits more 'abstract' side; Strauss has partially solved it in another\r\nway, by making the 'moments' of the musical evolution of a work tally\r\nwith those of a program. Mahler, on the other hand, aimed at a course\r\nwhich was a sort of compromise between all the others. His nine\r\nsymphonies are neither abstract music nor program music in the ordinary\r\nsense of the latter word; yet they are 'programmatic' in the broad\r\nsense that in whole and in detail they are motived more or less by\r\ndefinite concepts of man and his life in the world. Mahler faced more\r\nclear-sightedly and consistently than any other composer of his day the\r\nproblem of the combination of the vocal and the symphonic form. That\r\nthis combination is full of as yet unrealized possibilities will be\r\ndoubted by no one familiar with the history of music since Beethoven.\r\nIn one shape or another the problem has confronted probably nine-tenths\r\nof our modern composers. Wagner found one partial solution of it in his\r\nsymphonic dramas, in which the orchestra pours out an incessant flood\r\nof eloquent music, the vague emotions of which are made definite for us\r\nby the words and the stage action. The ordinary symphonic poem attempts\r\nmuch the same thing by means of a printed program that is intended to\r\nhelp the hearer to read into the generalized expression of the music a\r\ncertain particular application of each emotion; we may put it either\r\nthat the symphonic poem is the Wagnerian music drama without the stage\r\nand the characters, or that the Wagnerian music drama is the symphonic\r\npoem translated into visible action. But for the best part of a century\r\nthe imagination of composers has been haunted by the experiment made\r\nby Beethoven in his Ninth Symphony, of combining actual voices with\r\nthe ordinary symphonic form; it has always been felt that instrumental\r\nmusic at its highest tension and utmost expression almost of necessity\r\ncalls out for completion in the human cry. Words are often necessary in\r\norder at once to intensify and to elucidate the vague emotions to which\r\nalone the instruments can give expression. It was the consciousness\r\nof this that impelled Liszt to introduce the chorus at the end of his\r\n'Dante' and 'Faust' symphonies.\r\n\r\nTo a mind like Mahler's, full of striving, of aspiration, of conscious\r\nreflection upon the world, it was even more necessary that some\r\nmeans should be found of giving definite direction to the indefinite\r\nsequences of emotion of instrumental music. Almost from the beginning\r\nhe adopted the device of introducing a vocal element into his\r\nsymphonies. In the Second, a solo contralto sings, in the fourth\r\nmovement, some lines from the _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_--'O rosebud red!\r\nMankind lies in sorest need, in sorest pain! In heaven would I rather\r\nbe!... I am from God, and back to God again will go; God in His mercy\r\nwill grant me a light, will lighten me to eternal, blessed life'--while\r\nthe idea of resurrection that is the theme of the music of the fifth\r\nmovement is _precisé_ by a chorus singing Klopstock's ode, 'After brief\r\nrepose thou shalt arise from the dead, my dust; immortal life shall\r\nbe thine.' In the fourth movement of the third symphony--the 'Nature'\r\nsymphony--a contralto solo sings the moving lines, '_O Mensch, gieb\r\nAcht!_' from Nietzsche's _Also sprach Zarathustra_; and in the sixth\r\nmovement the contralto and a female choir dialogue with each other in\r\nsome verses from _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_. Five stanzas from the same\r\npoem are set as a soprano solo in the finale of the Fourth Symphony.\r\nAnd in the First Symphony, though the voices are not actually used, the\r\ncomposer, in the first and third movements, draws upon the themes of\r\ncertain of his own songs (_Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen_). In the\r\nEighth Symphony the intermixture of orchestra and voices is so close\r\nthat the title of 'symphonic cantata' would fit the work perhaps as\r\nwell as that of 'symphony with voices'; here the kernel of the music is\r\nformed by the old Latin hymn _Veni, creator spiritus_ and some words\r\nfrom the final scene of the second part of Goethe's _Faust_.\r\n\r\nMahler's use of the voice in the orchestra is, as will be seen,\r\nsomething quite different from merely singing the 'program' of the\r\nwork instead of printing it. His aim is the suggestion of symbols\r\nrather than the painting of realities. Even where, on the face of the\r\ncase, it looks at first as if his object had been a realistic one,\r\nhis intention was often less realistic than mystical. In the Seventh\r\nSymphony, for instance, he introduces cowbells; we have it from his own\r\nmouth that here his aim was not simply a piece of pastoral painting,\r\nbut the suggestion of 'the last distant greeting from earth that\r\nreaches the wanderer on the loftiest heights.' 'When I conceive a big\r\nmusical painting,' he said once, 'I always come to a point at which I\r\nmust bring in speech as the bearer of my musical idea. So must it have\r\nbeen with Beethoven when writing his Ninth Symphony, only that his\r\nepoch could not provide him with the suitable materials--for at bottom\r\nSchiller's poem is not capable of giving expression to the \"unheard\"\r\nthat was within the composer.' In this Mahler is no doubt right; the\r\nmodern composer has a wider range of poetry to draw upon for the\r\nequivalent of his musical thought.\r\n\r\nMahler's form is in itself a beautiful and a rational one; and, as\r\nwith all other forms, the question is not so much the 'How' as the\r\n'What' of the music. Mahler, perhaps, never fully realized the best\r\nthere was in him; fine as his music often is, it as often suggests\r\na mind that had not yet arrived at a true inner harmony. His mind\r\nwas always an arena in which dim, vast dreams of music of his own\r\nstruggled with impressions from other men's music that incessantly\r\nthronged his brain as they must that of every busy conductor, and with\r\nmore or less vague, poetic, philosophical and humanitarian visions.\r\nHe never quite succeeded in making for himself an idiom unmistakably\r\nand exclusively his own; all sorts of composers, from Beethoven and\r\nBruckner to Johann Strauss, seem to nod to each other across his\r\npages. As the Germans would say, his _Können_ was not always equal to\r\nhis _Wollen_. His feverish energy, his excitable imagination, and his\r\nlack of concentration continually drove him to the writing of works\r\nof excessive length, demanding unusually large forces; the Eighth\r\nSymphony, for example, with its large orchestra, seven soloists, boys'\r\nchoir and two mixed choirs, calls for a _personnel_ of something like\r\none thousand. Yet he could be amazingly simple and direct at times, as\r\nis shown by his lovely songs and by many a passage in the symphonies\r\nthat have a folk-song flavor. His individuality as a symphonist is\r\nincontestable, and it is probable that as time goes on his reputation\r\nwill increase. Alone among modern German composers he is comparable to\r\nStrauss for general vitality, ardor of conception, ambition of purpose,\r\nand pregnancy of theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VI\r\n\r\nIn abstract music the biggest figure in the Germany of to-day is Max\r\nReger (born 1873)[32]--almost the only composer of our time who has\r\nremained unaffected by the changes everywhere going on in European\r\nmusic, though in his _Romantische Suite_ he coquets a little with\r\nFrench impressionism. His output is enormous, and almost suggests\r\nspawning rather than composition in the ordinary sense of the word. His\r\ngeneral idiom is founded mainly on Bach, with a slight indebtedness\r\nto Brahms; for anything in the nature of program music he appears\r\nto have no sympathy. The bulk of his work consists of organ music,\r\nsongs, and piano and chamber music. His facility is incredible. He\r\nspeaks a harmonic and contrapuntal language of exceptional richness;\r\nbut it must be said that very often his facility and the copiousness\r\nof his vocabulary tempt him to over-write his subject; sometimes the\r\ncontrapuntal web is woven so thickly that no music can get through.\r\nBut every now and then this rather heavy-limbed genius achieves\r\na curious limpidity and grace, and a moving tenderness. If it be\r\nundeniable that had Bach never lived a large part of Reger's music\r\nwould not have been written, it is equally undeniable that some of his\r\norgan works are worthy to be signed by Bach himself.\r\n\r\nIt may be a significant fact, as well as helpful in assaying the value\r\nof modern theoretical pedagogy, that Reger, super-technician that he\r\nis, was taught composition, as Riemann's _Lexikon_ boasts, 'entirely\r\nafter the text-books and editions of H. Riemann.' 'And,' it goes on to\r\nsay, 'in addition, he studied for five years under Riemann's personal\r\ndirection.' Riemann, it must be borne in mind, is not a composer, but\r\na theoretician of extraordinary capacity. How little to the liking of\r\nhis master Reger's subsequent development has been may be seen from the\r\nfollowing quotation from the same article: 'Reger evinced already in\r\nhis (unpublished) first compositions a tendency to extreme complication\r\nof facture and to an overloading of the technical apparatus, so that\r\nhis development ought to have been the opposite to that of Wagner, for\r\ninstance, i.e. a restriction of the imagination aiming at progressive\r\nsimplification. Instead of this he has allowed himself to be\r\ninfluenced by those currents in an opposite direction, regarding which\r\ncontemporary criticism has lost all judgment. With full consciousness\r\nhe heaps up daring harmonies and arbitrary feats of modulation in a\r\nmanner which is positively intolerant to the listener[!]. Reger's\r\nvery strong melodic gifts could not under such conditions arrive at\r\na healthy development. Only when a definite form forces him into\r\nparticular tracks (variations, fugue, chorale transcription) are his\r\nworks unobjectionable; the wealth of his inventive power and his\r\neminently polyphonic nature enable him to be sufficiently original\r\nand surprising even within such bounds. On the other hand, in simple\r\npieces of small dimensions, and in songs, his intentional avoidance of\r\nnatural simplicity is actually repugnant. His continuous prodigality of\r\nthe strongest means of expression soon surfeit one, and in the end this\r\nexcessive richness becomes a mere stereotyped mannerism.'\r\n\r\nNo doubt the learned doctor is somewhat pedantic, but curiously enough\r\nthe opinion of less conservative critics is not dissimilar. Dr. Walter\r\nNiemann refers to Reger's condensed, harmonically overladen style\r\nas a 'modern _barock_,' a 'degeneration of Brahmsian classicism.'\r\n'Universally admired is Reger's astounding contrapuntal routine,'\r\nhe says, 'the routine that is most evident in the (now schematic,\r\nstereotyped) construction of his fugues and double fugues; one also\r\ngenerally admires his enormous constructive ability (_satztechnisches\r\nKönnen_), the finished art of subtle detail which he exhibits most\r\ncharmingly in his smallest forms, the Sonatinas, the _Schlichte\r\nWeisen_. But, leaving out all the hypocrisy of fashion, the\r\nall-too-willing, unintelligent deification of the great name, all\r\nmusical cliquism and modernistic partisanship, the hearing of Reger's\r\nmusic either leaves us inwardly unconcerned and even bores us, or it\r\nstrikes us as more or less repulsive. Details may well please us,\r\nand we are often honestly prepared to praise a delicate mood, the\r\natmospheric coloring, the masterful construction. But, impartially, no\r\none will ever remark that Reger's art exerts heartfelt, profound or\r\nethical influences upon the listener.'[33]\r\n\r\nThe particular partisanship to which Niemann refers is one of the\r\noutstanding features of contemporary German musical life. Reger has\r\nenjoyed a truly extraordinary vogue in his own country. For that\r\nreason we are devoting somewhat more space to him than we otherwise\r\nshould, for we do not acknowledge his right to contend with Strauss\r\nfor the mastery of his craft. We certainly do not share the opinion\r\nof his partisans, who have pronounced him a reincarnated Bach, the\r\ncompleter of Beethoven, the heir to Brahms' mantle and what not. Great\r\nas is his ability, we share Niemann's view that 'his great power\r\nlies not in invention but in transformation and after-creation' (_Um\r\nund Nachschaffen_). Give him a good melody and he will embroider it,\r\nmetamorphose it, combine it with innumerable other elements in an\r\nerudite--we had almost said inspired--manner; give him a cast-iron\r\nform as a frame and he will fill it with the most richly colored,\r\ntumultuously crowded canvas, but the style of his broideries will be\r\ncuriously similar and all too fiercely pondered, the colors of his\r\ncanvas will suggest the studio instead of the open air, the figures\r\nwill be abnormal, fantastic or pathetic to the point of morbidity--they\r\nwill not be images of nature.\r\n\r\nBrahms is the prevailing influence in Reger, though in manner rather\r\nthan in spirit, the Bach polyphony and structure, the Liszt-Wagnerian\r\nharmonic color, and the acute German romanticism notwithstanding. As\r\nregards his symphonic and chamber works this is generally conceded and\r\nneeds no further comment.\r\n\r\nLike Brahms, by the way, Reger approached the orchestra reluctantly;\r\nsonatas for various instruments, chamber works in various combinations\r\npreceded his first orchestral essay. The _Sinfonietta_ (op. 90), the\r\nSerenade in G major (op. 95), the Hiller Variations (op. 100), the\r\nSymphonic Prologue to a Tragedy (op. 108), were presumably harbingers\r\nof a real symphony. Instead, however, there followed a _Konzert im\r\nalten Stil_ (op. 123), a 'Romantic Suite' (op. 125) and a 'Ballet\r\nSuite' (op. 130), again showing Reger's prediliction for the antique\r\nforms; and a series of 'Tone Poems after Pictures by Böcklin' (op.\r\n128),[34] which would indicate a turn toward the impressionistic\r\nmood-painting of the ultra-modern wing of the 'poetic' school. His\r\nviolin concerto, in A minor (op. 101), and the piano concerto, in\r\nF minor (op. 114), are, however, in effect symphonies with solo\r\ninstrument--again following Brahms' precept, but by a hopelessly thick\r\nand involved orchestration, he precludes anything like the interesting\r\nBrahmsian dialogue or discussion between the two elements.\r\n\r\nOf the mass of Reger's chamber music we should mention the five sonatas\r\nfor violin and piano, besides four for violin alone (in the manner of\r\nJ. S. Bach), in which he shows his contrapuntal skill to particular\r\nadvantage; the three clarinet sonatas, notable for beautiful slow\r\nmovements and characteristic Reger scherzos (which are usually either\r\ngrotesque, boisterous or spookish); two trios, three string quartets,\r\na string quintet, 'cello sonatas, two suites for piano and violin (of\r\nwhich the first, _Im alten Stil_, op. 93, is widely favored), and\r\nnumerous other pieces for violin, piano, etc. Reger has essayed choral\r\nwriting extensively, the _Gesang der Verklärten_ for five-part chorus\r\nand large orchestra (op. 71), _Die Nonnen_ (op. 112), and several\r\nseries of 'Folk Songs' being but part of the output. The much-favored\r\norgan compositions, chorale fantasias, preludes and fugues and in\r\nvarious other forms sanctified by the great Bach, are too numerous\r\nto mention and the songs (over 200 in number) will receive notice in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nOf the minor composers who owe allegiance to the New German School\r\nof Wagner and Liszt we may name first those of the immediate circle\r\nat Weimar--Peter Cornelius, Hans von Bülow, Eduard Lassen, and Felix\r\nDraeseke. Of these Bülow and Lassen have been mentioned in Chapter I.\r\nCornelius has already been remembered in connection with the later\r\nromantic opera as having successfully applied Wagner's principles to\r\nthe lighter dramatic genre ('Barber of Bagdad'), and has received\r\nfurther mention as a song-writer (see Vol. V, pp. 302ff). Here we may\r\npay him a brief tribute as the composer of beautiful choruses, in\r\nwhich he shows the influence of the older masters of choral art. Thus\r\n_Der Tod das ist die kühle Nacht_ recalls the gorgeous color of the\r\nRenaissance Venetians. From 1852 on, when Cornelius joined the Liszt\r\ncircle, he was one of the chief standard-bearers of the New German\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nFelix Draeseke's (born 1835) association with this group must be\r\nqualified, for, though originally drawn to Weimar by his enthusiasm\r\nfor Liszt, he later deserted the ranks of the New Germans and devoted\r\nhimself to the cultivation of the classic forms. This reversion seems\r\nto have been in the nature of a reform, for his early essays in\r\nthe freer modernistic manner are somewhat bizarre. In his harmonic\r\nand orchestral style, however, he continued to adhere to the 'New\r\nGerman' principles. In fact, he swung like a pendulum between the two\r\nopposite poles of modern German music. His compositions include three\r\nsymphonies--G major, F major, and C minor ('Tragica')--an orchestral\r\nserenade (op. 49); two symphonic preludes, a _Jubel-Overtüre_; three\r\nstring quartets and a number of other chamber works, a sonata and\r\nother pieces for piano, as well as a number of large choral works (a\r\nMass, op. 60; a Requiem, op. 30; 'Song of Advent,' op. 60; a mystery,\r\n_Christus_, consisting of a prelude and three oratorios; cantatas,\r\netc.); also several operas. Draeseke was a friend of Bülow. He taught\r\nat the Lausanne conservatory in 1868-69 and later at the Dresden\r\nconservatory. He is a royal Saxon professor, privy councillor, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother grand-ducal musical director at Weimar was August Klughardt\r\n(1847-1902), who wrote five symphonies, a number of overtures,\r\norchestral suites, etc. Like Draeseke, he was influenced both by the\r\nneo-classics and the 'New Germans.' Heinrich Porges (1837-1900), also\r\ndistinguished as a writer and conductor; Leopold Damrosch (1832-85),\r\nwho carried the Wagner-Liszt banner to America; Hans von Bronsart (b.\r\n1828) and his wife Ingeborg, both pupils of Liszt and distinguished in\r\npiano music (the former also for an orchestral fantasy and a choral\r\nsymphony, _In den Alpen_), should be mentioned as belonging to the same\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThere are other names of real importance in absolute music; there are\r\nPfitzner, Thuille, Schillings, Klose and Kaskel, there are Bungert,\r\nWeingartner, Goldmark and less significant names, but since these\r\nhave exercised their talents chiefly in the dramatic field we shall\r\ndefer our treatment of them to the following chapter. And, finally,\r\nthere is a host of followers of these, too numerous to be treated\r\nas individuals and if individually distinguished too recent to have\r\njudgment pronounced upon them. The most recent currents, too, shall\r\nhave attention in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n                                                         E.

In\r\naddition to this he received instruction from the organist Lindner\r\nin Weiden (where his father settled during Reger's infancy). After\r\nhis studies under Dr. Riemann (1890-95), he taught at the Wiesbaden\r\nconservatory, and (after some years' residence in his home town and\r\nin Munich) at the Royal Academy of Munich. In 1907 he became musical\r\ndirector at the Leipzig University and teacher of composition in the\r\nconservatory there, and in 1908 was made 'Royal Professor.' In 1908\r\nhe resigned his university post and in the same year was given the\r\nhonorary degree of doctor of philosophy by the University of Jena.\r\nLater, until 1915, he conducted the Meiningen orchestra.\r\n\r\n[33] Walter Niemann: _Die Musik seit Richard Wagner_, 1914.\r\n\r\n[34] These include _Der geigende Eremit_; _Spiel der Wellen_; _Die\r\nToteninsel_ and _Bacchanal_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n           GERMAN OPERA AFTER WAGNER AND MODERN GERMAN SONG\r\n\r\n    The Wagnerian after-current: Cyrill Kistler; August Bungert,\r\n    Goldmark, etc.; Max Schillings, Eugen d'Albert--The successful\r\n    post-Wagnerians in the lighter genre: Götz, Cornelius, and\r\n    Wolf; Engelbert Humperdinck's fairy opera; Ludwig Thuille;\r\n    Hans Pfitzner; the _Volksoper_--Richard Strauss as musical\r\n    dramatist--Hugo Wolf and the modern song; other contemporary\r\n    German lyricists--The younger men: Klose, Hausegger, Schönberg,\r\n    Korngold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nIt was only to be expected that the titanic personality of Wagner\r\nshould drag a number of smaller men after it, both in his own day and\r\nlater, by the sheer force of attraction of a great body for small\r\nones. In one of his essays Matthew Arnold characterizes the test of\r\nthe quality of a critic as the power 'to ascertain the master current\r\nin the literature of an epoch, and to distinguish this from all the\r\nminor currents.' This sensitiveness to master currents, however,\r\nthat is so essential to criticism, is generally a source of danger\r\nto the secondary creative minds; it is apt to tempt them to follow\r\nblindly in the wake of the master spirit, instead of trying to\r\nfind salvation on a road of their own. In the third quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century it was indubitably true that the master current in\r\nmusic was that set going by Wagner; but it was equally true that any\r\nother mariner who should venture upon that stream was pretty certain\r\nto be swamped by Wagner's backwash. So it has proved: with the sole\r\nexception of Humperdinck's _Hänsel und Gretel_, no operatic work of the\r\nlate nineteenth century that openly claimed kinship with Wagner has\r\nexhibited any staying power, while the more durable success has been\r\nreserved for works like Cornelius' _Barbier von Bagdad_ and Götz's _Der\r\nWiderspenstigen Zähmung_, that frankly recognized the impossibility of\r\nany smaller man than Wagner continuing Wagner's work.\r\n\r\nAs was inevitable, the more self-conscious of the post-Wagnerians\r\nfastened for imitation upon what they thought to be the essential\r\nWagner, but that a later day can see was the inessential. To them\r\nWagner was the re-creator of the world of the German saga. Posterity\r\nhas learned that with Wagner, as with all great creators, the matter\r\nis of much less account than his way of dealing with the matter. It\r\nis not the body of religious and cosmological beliefs underlying the\r\nGreek drama that makes the Greek dramatists what they are to us to-day.\r\nTheir very conception of the governance of the universe is a thing\r\nthat we find it hard to enter into even by an effort of the historical\r\nimagination; nevertheless these men are more vital to us than many of\r\nthe problem-play writers of our own epoch, simply because the emotional\r\nstuff in which they deal is of the eternal kind, and they have dealt\r\nwith it along lines that are independent of the mere thought of their\r\nown age. Similarly, what is most vital for us in Wagner now is not his\r\nmyths, his problems of the will, his conception of love, of redemption,\r\nof renunciation, or the verse forms into which he threw his ideas, but\r\nthe depth of his passion, the truth of his portraiture, the beauty and\r\neloquence of his speech. The real Wagner, in truth, was the Wagner\r\nthat no one could hope to imitate. But the generation that grew up in\r\nhis mighty shadow imagined that all it had to do was to re-exploit the\r\nmere externalities of his work. Like him, it would delve into German\r\nmyths or German folk-lore for its subjects; like him, it would adopt an\r\nalliterative mode of poetic diction; like him, it would treat the less\r\nintense moments of drama in a quasi-recitative that was supposed to be\r\nan intensification of the intervals and accents of ordinary speech. But\r\nall these things in themselves were merely the clothes without the man;\r\nand not one of Wagner's immediate successors showed himself big enough\r\nto wear his mantle. Many of these works written in a conspicuously\r\nWagnerian spirit have still considerable interest for the student of\r\nmusical history--the _Kunihild_ (1848), for example, of Cyrill Kistler\r\n(1848-1907)--but not enough vitality to preserve for them a permanent\r\nplace in the theatre repertory. (The same composer's _Baldur's Tod_,\r\nwritten in the 'eighties, was not performed till 1905 in Düsseldorf.)\r\nThe big Homeric tetralogy of August Bungert, _Odysseus Heimkehr_\r\n(1896), _Kirke_ (1898), _Nausikaa_ (1900-01), and _Odysseus Tod_\r\n(1903), is an attempt to do for the Greek myths what Wagner did for the\r\nTeutonic. (The composer is said to be engaged upon a second tetralogy\r\nof the same order, bearing the general title of 'Ilias.') How seriously\r\none section of the German musical public took these colossal plans was\r\nshown by the proposal to erect a 'Festspielhaus' on the Rhine that\r\nshould be to Bungert music-drama what Bayreuth is to the Wagnerian.\r\nAfter a fair amount of success in the years immediately following their\r\nproduction, however, Bungert's operas have fallen out of the repertory.\r\nHis talent is indeed lyrical rather than dramatic. Bungert was born in\r\nMülheim (Ruhr) in 1846 and studied at the Cologne Conservatory and in\r\nParis. He became musical director in Kreuznach (1869) and has since\r\nlived chiefly in Karlsruhe and Berlin. Besides the 'tetralogy' he wrote\r\na comic opera, _Die Studenten von Salamanka_ (1884), and some symphonic\r\nand chamber works. His songs (including Carmen Sylva's 'Songs of a\r\nQueen') have probably more permanent value than the rest of his work.\r\n\r\nThe opera has in fact tempted many of the German lyricists to try to\r\nexceed their powers. Hans Sommer (born 1837), who has produced a\r\nnumber of songs of fine feeling and perspicuous workmanship, attempted\r\na Wagnerian flight in his opera _Loreley_ (1891), in which the\r\ntreatment is a little too heavy for the subject. Like so many of his\r\ncontemporaries, he frequently suffers for the sins of his librettists.\r\nFelix Draeseke (b. 1835) has hovered uncertainly between Schumannesque\r\nand Wagnerian ideals; his most successful opera is _Herrat_ (1892).[35]\r\nAdalbert von Goldschmidt (1848-1906) aimed, as others of his kind did,\r\nat continuing the Wagner tradition not only in the musical but in\r\nthe poetic line. He was his own librettist in the opera _Helianthus_\r\n(1884); but in the music of both this and the later opera _Gaea_ (1889)\r\nthe Wagnerian influence is obvious. Carl Goldmark (1830-1915) brought\r\nthe best musical qualities of a mind that was eclectic both by heredity\r\nand environment to bear upon the very successful operas _Die Königin\r\nvon Saba_ (1875), _Merlin_ (1886), and _Das Heimchen am Herd_ (1896),\r\nfounded on Dickens's 'Cricket on the Hearth.'\r\n\r\nThough a native of Hungary (Keszthely, 1830), Goldmark received a\r\nthoroughly German training in Vienna, where he studied the violin with\r\nJansa. He entered the conservatory in 1847 and, since that institution\r\nwas closed the following year, he continued his studies by himself.\r\nIn 1865 he aroused attention with his overture _Sakuntala_, which is\r\nstill in the orchestral répertoire. Happily guided by an artistic\r\ninstinct, he hit upon a vein which his talent especially fitted him to\r\nexploit, namely, the painting of vivid oriental color. His first opera,\r\n'The Queen of Sheba,' produced in Vienna in 1875, following the same\r\ntendency with equal success, has preserved its popularity till to-day.\r\nThe chronological order of his other operas is as follows:\r\n\r\n_Merlin_ (Vienna, 1886, and revised for Frankfort, 1904); 'The\r\nCricket on the Hearth' (1896); 'The Prisoner of War' (1899); _Götz\r\nvon Berlichingen_ (1902); and 'A Winter's Tale' (1908). His symphonic\r\nworks include, besides the _Sakuntala_ overture, an orchestral suite\r\n(symphony) 'The Rustic Wedding,' a symphony in E-flat, the overtures\r\n'Penthesilea,' 'In Spring,' 'Prometheus Bound,' 'Sappho,' and 'In\r\nItaly'; a symphonic poem 'Zrínyi' (1903), two violin concertos, a piano\r\nquintet, a string quartet, a suite for piano and violin, pianoforte and\r\nchoral works.\r\n\r\nAn apt criticism of Goldmark's style is given by Eugen Schmitz in the\r\nrevision of Naumann's _Musikgeschichte_: 'In any case, we know of\r\nno second composer of the present time who can paint the exoticism\r\nand _fata morgana_ of the Orient and the tropics, the sultriness and\r\nthe effects of a climate that arouses devouring passions, as well\r\nas the peculiarity and special nature of the inhabitants, in such\r\ncharacteristic and glowing tone-colors as Goldmark has succeeded\r\nin doing. Herein, however, lies not only his strength but also his\r\nweakness; for he is exclusively a musical colorist, a colorist _à la_\r\nMakart, who sacrifices drawing and perspective for the sake of color.\r\nWhich means, translated into musical terms: a composer whose melodic\r\ninvention and thematic development does not stand in a proportionate\r\nrelationship to the intoxicating magic of tone-color combinations that\r\nhe employs. Moreover, his coloring is already beginning to fade beside\r\nthe corresponding achievements of the most modern composers of to-day.'\r\n\r\nA number of minor talents have from time to time obtained a momentary\r\nor a local success, without in the end doing anything to sustain the\r\nhope that something really vital might be expected of them; of works\r\nof this order we may mention the _Urvasi_ (1886), _Der Evangelimann_\r\n(1894), _Don Quixote_ (1898), and _Kuhreigen_ (1911) of Wilhelm\r\nKienzl (1857);[36] _Die Versunkene Glocke_ and _Faust_ of Heinrich\r\nZöllner (1854); the _Ingwelde_ (1894), _Der Pfeifertag_ (1899), and\r\n_Moloch_ (1906) of Max Schillings (born 1868); the _Sakuntala_ (1884),\r\n_Malawika_ (1886), _Genesius_ (1893), and _Orestes_[37] (1902) of\r\nFelix Weingartner (born 1863). In these and some dozen or two of other\r\nmodern Germans, composition is an act of the will rather than of the\r\nimagination. The generous eclecticism and superficial effectiveness of\r\nthe _Tiefland_ (1903) of Eugen d'Albert (born 1864) have won for it\r\nexceptional popularity.\r\n\r\nThe classification of Schillings as a 'minor talent' would probably not\r\nmeet with the approval of many critics and musicians in Germany, where\r\nhis influence is considerable. Schillings is one of the ramparts of the\r\nprogressive musical citadel of Munich, the centre from which the Reger,\r\nPfitzner and Thuille strands radiate. If aristocracy and nobility\r\nare the outstanding characteristics of his highly individual muse,\r\na corresponding exclusiveness, coldness and artificiality accompany\r\nthem. His perfection is that of the marble, finely chiselled, hard and\r\npolished. His music is a personal expression, but his personality is\r\none that never experienced the depths of human suffering. Schillings\r\nwas born in the Rhineland (Düren) in 1868 and finished his studies in\r\nMunich. There he became 'royal professor' in 1903 and later he went\r\nto Stuttgart as general musical director in connection with the court\r\ntheatre. Besides his operas he wrote the symphonic prologue 'Œdipus'\r\n(1900), music for the 'Orestes' of Æschylus (1900) and for Goethe's\r\n'Faust' (Part I). Of non-dramatic works there are two 'fantasies,'\r\n_Meergruss_ and _Seemorgen_; _Ein Zwiegespräch_ for small orchestra,\r\nsolo violin and solo 'cello, a hymn-rhapsody, _Dem Verklärten_ (after\r\nSchiller) for mixed chorus, baritone and orchestra (op. 21, 1905),\r\n_Glockenlieder_ for tenor and orchestra, some chamber music and about\r\nforty songs. Especially successful are his three 'melodramatic'\r\nworks, i.e. music to accompany recitation, of which the setting of\r\nWildenbruch's _Hexenlied_ is best known.\r\n\r\nWeingartner and d'Albert, too, are considerable figures in contemporary\r\nGerman music, though their records as executive artists may outlive\r\ntheir reputations as composers, the first being a brilliant and\r\nauthoritative conductor, the latter a pianist of extraordinary\r\ncalibre. Besides the operas mentioned above Weingartner has written\r\nthe symphonic poems 'King Lear' and 'The Regions of the Blest,' two\r\nsymphonies, three string quartets and a piano sextet (op. 20), songs\r\nand piano pieces. He has also distinguished himself as a critic\r\nand author of valuable books of a practical and æsthetic nature.\r\nD'Albert's evolution from pianist to composer was accomplished in the\r\nusual manner, by way of the piano concerto. He wrote two of them (op.\r\n2 and 12), then a 'cello concerto (op. 20), and promptly embarked\r\nupon a symphonic career with two overtures ('Esther' and 'Hyperion')\r\nand the symphony in F. Then came chamber music, songs and various\r\nother forms. His piano arrangements of Bach's organ works are justly\r\npopular. His first opera was _Der Rubin_ (1893), then came _Ghismonda_\r\n(1895), _Gernot_ (1897), _Die Abreise_ (1898), all of good Wagnerian\r\nextraction; then _Kain_ and _Der Improvisator_ (1900), showing\r\nevidences of an individual style, and, finally, _Tiefland_ (1903),\r\nthe one really successful opera of d'Albert, which seems to have\r\nbecome permanent in the German répertoire. _Flauto solo_ (1905) and\r\n_Tragaldabas_ (1907) have not made a great stir. D'Albert is of Scotch\r\nbirth (Glasgow, 1864), though his father was a native of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nOn the whole, German opera of the more ambitious kind cannot be said\r\nto have produced much that is likely to be durable between Wagner and\r\nStrauss. The indubitable master works have been for the most part\r\nin the lighter genres--the delightful _Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung_\r\n(1874) of Hermann Götz (1840-1876), the _Barbier von Bagdad_ (1858)\r\nof Peter Cornelius (1824-1874) (a gem of grace and humor), and the\r\n_Hänsel und Gretel_ (1893) of Engelbert Humperdinck, in which the\r\nWagnerian polyphony is applied with the happiest effect to a style that\r\nis the purest distillation of the German folk-spirit. Of Cornelius's\r\nwork we have spoken elsewhere (Vol. II, pp. 380f), of Humperdinck we\r\nshall have something to say presently. Here let us dwell for a moment\r\non Götz. His one finished opera (a second, _Francesca da Rimini_, he\r\ndid not live to finish) has been called a 'little _Meistersinger_.'\r\nWhether applied with justice or not, this epithet indicates the work's\r\nspiritual relationship. Yet, Wagnerian that he is, this classification\r\nmust be made with reserve. A close friend of Brahms, he was certainly\r\ninfluenced by that master--in a measure he combines the rich and varied\r\ntexture of Brahms' chamber music with the symphonic style of the\r\n_Meistersinger_. Niemann points out other influences. 'He takes Jensen\r\nby the left hand, Cornelius by the right; like both of these, he is\r\nlyrist and worker in detail without a real dramatic vein and a model of\r\nthe idealistic German master of an older time.' _Der Widerspenstigen\r\nZähmung_ was first heard in 1874 in Mannheim and achieved wide\r\npopularity. It is based on Shakespeare ('Taming of the Shrew'), and\r\nan English text was used in England. Götz was born in Königsberg and\r\ndied near Zürich. He was a pupil of Köhler, Stern, Bülow and Ulrich,\r\nand was organist in Winterthur from 1867 to 1870, when failing health\r\nforced him into retirement.\r\n\r\nHugo Wolf's[38] _Der Corregidor_ (1896) is, in its endless flow of\r\nmelody and its sustained vitality of characterization, perhaps the\r\nnearest approach in modern music to the _Meistersinger_; for some\r\nreason or other, however, a work that is a pure delight in the home\r\ndoes not seem able to maintain itself on the stage. A second opera of\r\nWolf's, _Manuel Venegas_, in which we can trace the same extraordinary\r\nsimplification and clarification of style that is evident in his\r\nlatest songs, remained only a fragment at his death. The successes,\r\nnot less than the failures, of these and other men showed clearly that\r\nthe further they got from the main Wagnerian stream the safer they\r\nwere. Cornelius, though living in Wagner's immediate environment and\r\ncherishing a passionate admiration for the great man, knew well that\r\nhis own salvation lay in trying to write as if Wagner had never lived.\r\nThe _Barbier von Bagdad_ was written some years before the composition\r\nof the _Meistersinger_ had begun; if Cornelius went anywhere for a\r\nmodel for his own work it was to the _Benvenuto Cellini_ of Berlioz. He\r\nknew the danger he was in during the composition of his second opera,\r\n_Der Cid_, and strove desperately to shut out Wagner from his mind at\r\nthat time; he did not want, as he put it, simply to hatch Wagnerian\r\neggs. If _Der Cid_ (1865) fails, it is not because of any Wagnerian\r\ninfluence, but because Cornelius's genius was of too light a tissue for\r\nso big a stage subject. Nevertheless, if he does not wholly fill the\r\ndramatic frame, he comes very near doing so; it is no small dramatic\r\ngift that is shown in such passages as the _Trauermarsch_ in the second\r\nscene of the first act and the subsequent monologue of Chimene, in\r\nChimene's scena in the second scene of the second act, and in most\r\nof the choral writing. A third opera, _Gunlöd_, was orchestrated by\r\nLassen and Hoffbauer and produced seventeen years after Cornelius's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Modern German Musical Dramatists:]\r\n\r\n                  Ludwig Thuille         Hans Pfitzner\r\n               Engelbert Humperdinck     Karl Goldmark\r\n\r\nHumperdinck seems destined to go down to posterity as the composer of\r\none work. His _Hänsel und Gretel_ owes its incomparable charm not to\r\nthe Wagnerianisms of it, which lie only on the surface, but to its\r\nexpressing once for all the very soul of a certain order of German\r\nfolk-song and German _Kindlichkeit_. His later works--_Die sieben\r\nGeislein_ (1897), _Dornröschen_ (1902), and the comic opera _Die\r\nHeirat wider Willen_ (1905), though containing much beautiful music,\r\nhave on the whole failed to convince the world that Humperdinck has\r\nany new chapter to add to German opera. For this his librettists must\r\nperhaps share the blame with him. _Die Königskinder_ (1898), which\r\nwas originally a melodrama, was recast as an opera in 1908 and, at\r\nleast in America, was more successful. Besides these Humperdinck wrote\r\nincidental music for Aristophanes' _Lysistrata_, Shakespeare's 'A\r\nWinter's Tale' and 'Tempest.' Two choral ballads preceded the operas\r\nand a 'Moorish Rhapsody' (1898) was composed for the Leeds Festival.\r\nHumperdinck was born in Siegburg (Rhineland), studied at the Cologne\r\nConservatory, also in Munich and in Italy. He taught for a time in\r\nBarcelona (Spain) and in Frankfort (Hoch Conservatory), and in 1900\r\nbecame head of a master school of composition in Berlin with the title\r\nof royal professor and member of the senate of the Academy of Arts.\r\n\r\nA worthy companion to _Hänsel und Gretel_ is the _Lobetanz_ (1898)\r\nof Ludwig Thuille (1861-1907). Thuille's touch is lighter than\r\nHumperdinck's. Thuille was a highly esteemed artist, especially among\r\nthe Munich circle of musicians. He is the only one of the group of\r\nimportant composers settled there since Rheinberger's demise that may\r\nbe said to have founded a 'school.' He is the heir and successor of\r\nRheinberger and by virtue of his pedagogic talent the master of all\r\nthe younger South German moderns. Though _Lobetanz_ (which was preceded\r\nby _Theuerdank_, 1897, and _Gugeline_, 1901) is the best known of his\r\nworks, the chamber music of his later period has probably the most\r\npermanent value.[39] Thuille was born in Bozen (Tyrol) and died in\r\nMunich, where he was professor at the Royal Academy of Music.\r\n\r\nSome success has been won by the _Donna Anna_ (1895) of E. N. von\r\nReznicek (born 1860), a showy work compact of many styles--grand\r\nopera, operetta, the early Verdi, _Tannhäuser_, and the Spanish\r\n'national' idiom all jostling each other's elbows. There is little\r\nreal differentiation of character; such differentiation as there is is\r\nonly in musical externals--in costume rather than in psychology. In\r\nGermany a certain following is much devoted to Hans Pfitzner, whose\r\nopera _Der arme Heinrich_ was produced in 1895, and his _Die Rose vom\r\nLiebesgarten_ in 1901. Pfitzner is a musician of more earnestness than\r\ninspiration. He is technically well equipped, and all that he does\r\nindicates refinement and intelligence; but he lacks the imagination\r\nthat fuses into new life whatever material it touches. (He has also\r\nwritten some fairly expressive songs and a small amount of chamber\r\nmusic.) Pfitzner, like Alex. Ritter, is of Russian birth, being\r\nborn (of German parents) in Moscow in 1869. His father and the Hoch\r\nConservatory in Frankfurt were the sources of his musical education.\r\nSince 1892 he has taught and conducted in various places (Coblentz,\r\nMainz, Berlin, Munich). In 1908 he became municipal musical director\r\nand director of the conservatory at Strassburg. Besides the two operas\r\nhe has written music for Ibsen's play, 'The Festival of Solhaug'\r\n(1889), also for Kleist's _Kätchen von Heilbronn_ (1908) and Ilse von\r\nStach's _Christelflein_. An orchestral Scherzo (1888), several choral\r\nworks and vocal works with orchestra complete the list of his works\r\nbesides those mentioned above.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of completeness, brief mention must here be made of the\r\nGerman _Volksoper_, a comparatively unambitious genre in which much\r\ngood work has been done. Among its best products in recent years are\r\nthe quick-witted _Versiegelt_ (1908) of Leo Blech (born 1871), and the\r\n_Barbarina_ of Otto Neitzel (born 1852).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nThe biggest figure in modern German operatic music, as in instrumental\r\nmusic, is Richard Strauss. It was perhaps inevitable that this should\r\nbe so. The more massive German opera after Wagner was almost bound\r\nto find what further development was possible to it in the Wagnerian\r\nsemi-symphonic form; the difficulty was to find a composer capable\r\nof handling it. This form was simply the expression of a spirit that\r\nhad come down to German music from Beethoven, and that had to work\r\nitself out to the full before the next great development--whatever\r\nthat may prove to be--could be possible; it is the same spirit that\r\nis visible, in different but still related shapes, in the symphonic\r\ntissue of the Wagnerian orchestra, the symphonic poems of Liszt, the\r\nsymphonies of Brahms, the pianoforte accompaniments of Wolf and Marx\r\nand their fellows, and the copious and vivid orchestral speech of\r\nStrauss. It is a method that is perhaps only thoroughly efficacious for\r\ncomposers whose heredity and environment make the further working out\r\nof the German tradition their most natural form of musical thinking.\r\nThat it is not the form best suited to peoples to whom this tradition\r\nis not part of their blood and being is shown by the dramatic\r\npoignancy attained by such widely different dramatic methods as those\r\nof Moussorgsky, Puccini, and Debussy. But when a race has, in the\r\ncourse of generations, made for itself an instrument so magnificent\r\nin its power and scope, and one so peculiarly its own, as the German\r\nquasi-symphonic form, it is the most natural thing in the world that\r\nvirtually all the best of its thinking should be done by its aid. It\r\nwas therefore perhaps not an accident, but the logical outcome of the\r\nwhole previous development of German music, that the mind that was to\r\ndominate the German opera of our own day should be the mind that had\r\nalready proved itself to be the most fertile, original, and audacious\r\nin the field of instrumental music. But it was a law for Strauss,\r\nno less than for his smaller contemporaries, that if he was to be\r\nsomething more than a mere _nach-Wagnerianer_ he must do his work\r\noutside not only the ground Wagner had occupied, but outside the ground\r\nstill covered by his gigantic shadow.\r\n\r\nIt was well within that shadow, however, that Strauss's first\r\ndramatic attempt was made. It is not so much that the musical style\r\nof _Guntram_ (1892-93) is now and then reminiscent of _Tannhäuser_,\r\nof _Lohengrin_ or of _Parsifal_, while one of the themes has actually\r\nstepped straight out of the pages of _Tristan_. A composer can often\r\nindicate unmistakably his musical paternity and yet give us the clear\r\nimpression that he has a genuine personality and style of his own. As\r\na matter of fact, the general style of _Guntram_ is unquestionably\r\nStrauss, and no one else. Where the Wagnerian influence is most evident\r\nis in the mental world in which the opera is set. The story, it is\r\ntrue--the text, by the way, is Strauss's own--is not drawn from the\r\nworld of saga; but the general conception of an order of knights, the\r\nobject of whose brotherhood is to bind all humanity in bonds of love,\r\nis obviously a last watering-down of that doctrine of redemption by\r\nlove that played so large a part in the intellectual life of Wagner.\r\nIt is possible that this peculiar mentality of _Guntram_ was the\r\naftermath of a breakdown in Strauss's health in 1892. The work has\r\na high-mindedness, a spiritual fervor, an ethos that has never been\r\nparticularly prominent in Strauss's work as a whole, and that has\r\nbecome more and more infrequent in it as he has grown older. _Guntram_\r\nis a convalescent's work, written in the mood of exalted idealism that\r\nconvalescence so often brings with it in men of complex nature. But\r\nwhatever be the physical or psychological explanation of the origin\r\nof _Guntram_, there is no doubt that the music lives in a finer,\r\npurer atmosphere than that of Strauss's work as a whole; and for this\r\nreason alone it will perhaps inspire respect even when its purely\r\nmusical qualities may have become outmoded. The musical method of it\r\ncontains in embryo all the later Strauss. The orchestral tissue has\r\nnot, of course, the extraordinary exuberance of diction and of color\r\nof his subsequent operas, but the affiliation with Wagner is quite\r\nevident. There is a certain melodic angularity here and there, and a\r\ntendency to get harmonic point by mere audacious and self-conscious\r\nsingularity--both defects being characteristic of a powerful and\r\neager young brain possessed with ideals of expression that it is not\r\nyet capable of realizing. The general idiom is in the main that of\r\n_Tod und Verklärung_ and _Don Juan_. It is worth noting that already\r\nin Strauss's first opera we perceive that failure to vivify all the\r\ncharacters equally that is so pronounced in the later works. It is one\r\nof the signs that, great as he is, he is not of the same great breed as\r\nWagner.\r\n\r\nBy the time he came to write his second opera, _Feuersnot_ (1900-01),\r\nStrauss had passed through all the main stages of his development\r\nas an orchestral composer; in _Till Eulenspiegel_, _Also sprach\r\nZarathustra, Don Quixote_, and _Ein Heldenleben_ he had come to\r\nthorough consciousness of himself, and attained an extraordinary\r\nfacility of technique. Under these circumstances one would have\r\nexpected _Feuersnot_ to be a rather better work than it actually is.\r\nOne's early enthusiasm for it becomes dissipated somewhat in the course\r\nof years--no doubt because as we look back upon it each of its faults\r\nhas to bear not only its own burden, but the burden of all the faults\r\nof the same kind that have been piled up by Strauss in his later\r\nworks. The passion of the love music, for instance, has more than a\r\ntouch of commonplace in it now--as of a Teutonic Leoncavallo--our eyes\r\nhaving been opened by _Elektra_ and 'The Legend of Joseph' to the\r\npit of banality that always yawns at Strauss's elbow, and into which\r\nhe finds it harder and harder to keep from slipping. We see Strauss\r\nexperimenting here with the dance rhythms that he has so successfully\r\nexploited in _Der Rosenkavalier_; but to some of these also time has\r\ngiven a slightly vulgar air. But a great deal of the opera still\r\nretains its charm; some portions of it are a very happy distillation\r\nfrom the spirit of German popular music, and the music of the children\r\nwill probably never lose its freshness. On the whole, the opera is the\r\nleast significant of all Strauss's work of this class. It is clear that\r\nhis long association with the concert room had made an instrumental\r\nrather than a vocal composer of him; much of the writing for the voice\r\nis awkward and inexpressive.\r\n\r\nIn the _Symphonia Domestica_ (1903) were to be distinguished the first\r\nunmistakable signs of a certain falling off in Strauss's inspiration,\r\na certain coarsening of the thought and a tendency to be too easily\r\nsatisfied with the first idea that came into his head. These symptoms\r\nhave become more and more evident in all the operas that have followed\r\nthis last of the big instrumental works, though it has to be admitted\r\nthat Strauss shows an extraordinary dexterity in covering up his weak\r\nplaces. Wagner's enemies, adapting an old gibe to him, used to say\r\nthat his music consisted of some fine moments and some bad quarters of\r\nan hour. That was not true of Wagner, but it is becoming increasingly\r\ntrue of the later Strauss. For a while the quality of the really\r\ninspired moments was so superb as to more than compensate us for the\r\ndisappointment of the moments that were obviously less inspired; but as\r\ntime has gone on the inspired moments have become extremely rare and\r\nthe others regrettably plentiful. We are probably not yet in a position\r\nto estimate justly the ultimate place of Strauss in the history of the\r\nopera. No composer has ever presented us with a problem precisely like\r\nhis. The magnificent things in his work are of a kind that make us at\r\nfirst believe they will succeed in saving the weaker portions from the\r\nshipwreck that, on the merits of these alone, would seem to be their\r\nfate. Then, as each new work deepens the conviction that Strauss is the\r\nmost sadly-flawed genius in the history of music, as he passes from\r\nbanality to banality, each of them worse than any of its predecessors,\r\nwe find ourselves, when we turn back to the earlier works, less\r\ndisposed than before to look tolerantly on what is weakest in them.\r\nWhat will be the final outcome of it all--whether the halo round his\r\nhead will ultimately blind us to the mud about his feet, or whether the\r\nmud will end by submerging the halo, no one can at present say. The\r\nRichard Strauss of to-day is an insoluble mystery.\r\n\r\nSomething excessive or unruly appears to be inseparable from everything\r\nhe does. A consistent development is impossible for him; he oscillates\r\nviolently like some sensitive electrical instrument in a storm.\r\nBut, while only partisanship could blind anyone to the too palpable\r\nevidences of degeneration that his genius shows at many points, it is\r\nbeyond question that in the best of his later stage works he dwarfs\r\nevery other composer of his day. We may like or dislike the subject of\r\n_Salome_, according to our temperament; how far the question of ethics\r\nought to be allowed to determine our attitude to an art work is a point\r\non which it is perhaps hopeless to expect agreement. For the present\r\nwriter the point is one of no importance, because the whole discussion\r\nseems to him to arise out of a confusion of the distinctive spheres of\r\nlife and art. A Salome in life would be a dangerous and objectionable\r\nperson, but then so would an Iago; and, as no one calls Shakespeare a\r\nmonster of iniquity because he has drawn Iago with zest, one can see\r\nno particular justice in calling Strauss's mind a morbid one because\r\nit has been interested in the psychology of a pervert like Salome.\r\nOne is driven to the conclusion that the root of the whole outcry is\r\nto be found in the prejudice many people have against too close an\r\nanalysis of the psychology of sex, especially in its more perverted\r\nmanifestations. One can respect that prejudice without sharing it; but\r\none is bound to say it unfits the victim of it for appreciation of\r\n_Salome_ as a work of art. The opera as a whole is not a masterpiece.\r\nIt lives only in virtue of its great moments; and Strauss has not been\r\nmore successful here than elsewhere in breathing life into every one of\r\nhis characters. Herod and Herodias have no real musical physiognomy;\r\nwe could not, that is to say, visualize them from their music alone\r\nas we can visualize a Hagen, a Mime, or even a David. But Salome\r\nis characterized with extraordinary subtlety. Music is here put to\r\npsychological uses undreamt of even by Wagner. The strange thing is\r\nthat, in spite of himself, the artist in Strauss has risen above the\r\nsubject. Wilde's Salome is a lifeless thing, a mere figure in some\r\nstiffly-woven tapestry. Strauss pours so full a flood of emotion over\r\nher that the music leaves us a final sensation, not of cold horror but\r\nof sadness and pity.\r\n\r\nHe similarly humanizes the central character of his next opera,\r\n_Elektra_ (1907), making of her one of the great tragic figures of the\r\nstage; and he throws an antique dignity round the gloomy figure of the\r\nfate-bearing Orestes. But, as with _Salome_, the opera as a whole is\r\nnot a great work. It contains a good deal of merely sham music, such as\r\nthat of the opening scene--music in which Strauss simply talks volubly\r\nand noisily to hide the fact that he has nothing to say; and there is\r\nmuch commonplace music, such as that of the outburst of Chrysothemis to\r\nElektra, and most of that of the final duet of the pair. One is left\r\nin the end with a feeling of blank amazement that the mind that could\r\nproduce such great music as that of the opening invocation of Agamemnon\r\nby Elektra, that of the entry of Orestes, and that of the recognition\r\nof brother and sister, could be so lacking in self-criticism as to\r\nplace side by side with these such banalities as are to be met with\r\nelsewhere in the opera. The only conclusion the close student of\r\nStrauss could come to after _Elektra_ was that the commonplace that\r\nwas not far from some of his finest conceptions from the first was now\r\nbecoming fatally easy to him.\r\n\r\n_Der Rosenkavalier_ (1913) confirmed this impression. Its waltzes\r\nhave earned for it a world-wide popularity. They are charming\r\nenough, but there are no doubt a hundred men in Europe who could\r\nhave written these. What no other living composer could have written\r\nis the music--so wise, so human--of the scene between Octavian and\r\nthe Marschallin at the end of the first act, the music of the entry\r\nof the Rosenkavalier in the second act, and the great trio in the\r\nthird, that can look the _Meistersinger_ quintet in the face and not\r\nbe ashamed. But again and again in the _Rosenkavalier_ we meet with\r\nmusic that is the merest mechanical product of an energetic brain\r\nworking without inspiration--the bulk of the music of the third act,\r\nfor instance, as far as the trio. And once more Strauss shows, by his\r\nquite indefinite portraiture of Faninal and Sophia, that his powers of\r\nmusical characterization are limited to the leading personages of his\r\nworks. Since _Der Rosenkavalier_ the general quality of his thinking\r\nhas obviously deteriorated. There are very few pages of _Ariadne auf\r\nNaxos_ that are above the level of the ordinary German kapellmeister,\r\nwhile that of the mimodrama, 'The Legend of Joseph,' is the most\r\npretentiously commonplace that Strauss has ever produced. If his\r\ncareer were to end now, the best epitaph we could find for him would\r\nbe Bülow's remark _à propos_ of Mendelssohn: 'He began as a genius and\r\nended as a talent.' Strauss's ten years in the theatre have undoubtedly\r\ndone him much harm; they have especially made him careless as to the\r\nquality of much of his music, knowing as he does that the excitement\r\nof the action and the general illusion of the theatre may be trusted\r\nto keep the spectator occupied. But one may perhaps venture to predict\r\nthat unless he returns to the concert room for a while, and forgets\r\nthere a great deal of what he has learned in the theatre, he will not\r\neasily recover the position he has latterly lost.\r\n\r\nLess well-known names in contemporary German opera, some of which,\r\nhowever, are too important to be omitted, are Ignaz Brüll (1846-1907),\r\na Viennese whose dialogue opera _Das goldene Kreuz_ (1875) is still\r\nin the German répertoire;[40] Edmund Kretschmer (b. 1830) with _Die\r\nFolkunger_ (1874), on a Scandinavian subject treated in the earlier\r\nWagnerian style, and _Heinrich der Löwe_ (1877); and Franz von Holstein\r\n(b. 1826) with _Die Heideschacht_, etc. Karl Reinthaler (1822-96) and\r\nKarl Grammann (1842-97) also wrote operas successful in their time,\r\nas did also Hiller, Wüerst, Reinecke, Dietrich, Abert, Rheinberger,\r\nand H. Hofmann, who are mentioned elsewhere. Siegfried Wagner (b.\r\n1869), son of the great master and a pupil of Humperdinck, should\r\nnot be overlooked. His talent is unpretentious, with a decided bent\r\nfor 'folkish' melody, and an excellent technical equipment. In _Der\r\nBärenhäuter_ (1899) he follows the fashion for fairy-opera; his four\r\nother operas (from _Der Kobold_ to _Sternengebot_, 1904) lean toward\r\nthe popular _Spieloper_, with a tinge of romanticism.\r\n\r\nKlose's 'dramatic symphony' _Ilsebill_ (1903) really belongs to the\r\ngenus fairy-opera. While Karl von Kaskel's (b. 1860) two charming\r\nworks, _Die Bettlerin vom Pont des Arts_ and _Dusle und Babell_, are to\r\nbe classified as _Spielopern_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nAs in the case of most other musical genres, Germany in the second half\r\nof the nineteenth century seemed to have made the province of the song\r\npeculiarly its own. For well over a hundred years it has never been\r\nwithout a great lyrist. Schubert gave the German lyric wings. Schumann\r\npoured into it the full, rich flood of German romanticism in its\r\nsincerest days. Robert Franz cultivated a relatively simple song-form,\r\nthe texture of which is not always as elastic as one could wish it\r\nto be; but he, too, was a man of pure and honest spirit, who sang of\r\nnothing that he had not deeply felt. Liszt first brought the song into\r\nsome sort of relation with the new ideals of operatic and instrumental\r\nmusic associated with his name and that of Wagner; and in spite of his\r\neffusiveness of sentiment and his diffusiveness of style he produced\r\nsome notable lyrics. In a song like _Es war ein König in Thule_, for\r\nexample, a new principle of unification can be seen at work, one\r\ngerminal theme being used for the construction of the whole song, which\r\nmight almost be an excerpt from a later Wagnerian opera. But the\r\nlyrical history of the latter half of the nineteenth century is really\r\nsummed up in the achievements of two men--Brahms and Hugo Wolf.[41]\r\n\r\nHugo Wolf, the foremost master of modern song, was born in\r\nWindischgrätz (Lower Styria), Austria, March 13, 1860, and died in\r\nan insane asylum in Vienna, February 22, 1903, the victim of a fatal\r\nbrain disease, which afflicted him during the last six years of his\r\ntragic existence. Thus his effective life was practically reduced\r\nto thirty-seven years--not much longer a span than that other great\r\nlyricist, Franz Schubert. Little can be said of this brief career,\r\nimpeded as it was by untoward circumstances and jealous opposition.\r\nTo these conditions Wolf opposed a heroic fortitude and a passionate\r\ndevotion to his art, which he practiced with uncompromising sincerity\r\nand religious assiduity. During long periods of work he remained in\r\nseclusion, maintaining a feverish activity and shutting himself off\r\nfrom outside influences. From 1875 on he lived almost continually in\r\nVienna, where he studied for a short time in the conservatory. His\r\nonly considerable absence he spent as conductor in Salzburg (1881).\r\nIn Vienna he taught and for some years (till 1887) wrote criticisms\r\nfor the _Salonblatt_. These articles have recently been collected and\r\npublished. They reflect the writer's high idealism; his intolerance\r\nof all artistic inferiority and mediocrity show him to have been as\r\nvaliant as an upholder of standards as he was discriminating in the\r\njudgment of æsthetic values, though his attack upon Brahms placed him\r\ninto a somewhat ridiculous light with a large part of the musical\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThus he eked out an existence; any considerable recognition as a\r\ncomposer he did not achieve during his lifetime. None of his works was\r\npublished till 1888, when his fifty-three Möricke songs (written within\r\nthree months) appeared. The Eichendorff cycle (twenty songs) came next,\r\nand then the _Spanisches Liederbuch_ (consisting of thirty-four secular\r\nand ten sacred songs), all written during 1889-90. Six songs for female\r\nvoice after poems by Gottfried Keller, the _Italienisches Liederbuch_\r\n(forty-six poems by Paul Heyse, published in two parts) were composed\r\nduring 1890-91 and in 1896 and the three poems by Michelangelo were set\r\nin 1897. Meantime there also came from his pen a hymn, _Christnacht_,\r\nfor soli, chorus and orchestra (1891), incidental music for Ibsen's\r\n'Festival of Solhaug' (1892), and in 1895 he wrote his _Corregidor_\r\n(already mentioned) within a few months. Other songs, some dating\r\nfrom his youth, were also published, as well as several choruses and\r\nchorus arrangements of songs. A string quartet in D minor (1879-80);\r\na symphonic poem for full orchestra, _Penthesilea_ (1883); and the\r\ncharming 'Italian Serenade' for small orchestra (also arranged for\r\nstring quartet by the composer) constitute his instrumental works--a\r\nsmall but choice aggregation.\r\n\r\nWolf was to the smaller field of the song what Wagner was to the\r\nlarger field of opera. That characterization of him must not be\r\nmisunderstood, as is often done, to mean that he simply took over\r\nthe methods of Wagnerian musical drama--especially the principle of\r\nthe leit-motif--and applied them to the song. He benefited by those\r\nmethods, as virtually every modern composer has done; but he never\r\napplied them in the merely conscious and imitative way that the\r\n'post-Wagnerians' did, for instance, in the opera. Wolf would have\r\nbeen a great lyrist had he been born in the eighteenth century, the\r\nsixteenth, or the twelfth; but it was his rare good fortune--the\r\nfortune that was denied to Schubert--to live in an epoch that could\r\nprovide him with a lyrical instrument capable of responding to every\r\nimpulse of his imagination. His was a truly exceptional brain, that\r\ncould probably never have come to its full fruition in any age but the\r\none he happened to be born into. He had not only the vision of new\r\nthings to be done in music, as Liszt and Berlioz and others have had\r\nbefore and since, but the power, which Liszt and Berlioz had not, to\r\nmake for himself a vocabulary that was copious enough, and a technique\r\nthat was strong and elastic enough, to permit the easy expression\r\nof everything he felt. It is another of the many points in which he\r\nresembles Wagner; with the minimum of school training in his earliest\r\ndays he made for himself a technical instrument that was purely his\r\nown--one that, when he had thoroughly mastered it, never failed\r\nhim, and that was capable of steady growth and infinitely delicate\r\nadaptation to the work of the moment.\r\n\r\nHe draws, as Wagner did, a line of demarcation between an old world\r\nof feeling and a new one. As Wagner peopled the stage with more types\r\nthan Weber, and saw more profoundly into the psychology of characters\r\nof every kind, so Wolf enlarged the world of previous and contemporary\r\nlyrists and intensified the whole mental and emotional life of the\r\nlyrical form. Too much stress need not be laid on the mere fact that\r\nhe insisted on better 'declamation' than was generally regarded as\r\nsufficient in the song--on a shaping of the melody that would permit\r\nof the just accentuation of every word and syllable. This in itself\r\ncould be done, and indeed has been done, by many composers who have not\r\nthereby succeeded in persuading the world that they are of the breed\r\nof Wolf. The extraordinary thing with him was that this respect for\r\nverbal values was consistent with the unimpeded flow of an expressive\r\nvocal line and an equally expressive pianoforte tissue. The basis of\r\nhis manner is the utilizing of a quasi-symphonic form for the song. He\r\nmarks the end of monody in the lyric as Wagner marks the end of monody\r\nin the opera. With Wagner the orchestra was not a mere accompanying\r\ninstrument, a 'big guitar,' but a many-voiced protagonist in the drama\r\nitself. When the simple-minded hearer of half a century ago complained\r\nthat there was no melody in Wagner, he only meant that the melody was\r\nnot where he could distinguish it most easily--at the top. As a matter\r\nof fact, Wagner was giving him at least three times as much melody as\r\nthe best of the Italian opera writers, for in the _Meistersinger_ or\r\n_Tristan_ it is not only the actors who are singing but the orchestra,\r\nand not only the orchestra as a whole but the separate instruments of\r\nit. When the average man complained that Wagner was starving him of\r\nmelody, it was like a man drowning in a pond fifty feet deep crying out\r\nthat there was not water enough in the neighborhood for him to wash in.\r\n\r\nWolf, too, fills the instrumental part of his songs with as rich a life\r\nas the vocal part. But he does even more amazing feats in the way of\r\nco-operation between the two factors than Wagner did. Independent as\r\nthe piano part seemingly is, developing as if it had nothing to think\r\nof but its own symphonic course, it never distracts Wolf's attention\r\nfrom the vocal melody, which is handled with astonishing ease and\r\nfreedom. Not only does each phase of the poem enter just where the most\r\npoint can be given to it both poetically and declamatorily, without any\r\nregard for the mere four-square of the ordinary line or bar-divisions,\r\nbut each significant word receives its appropriate accent, melodic rise\r\nor fall, or fleck of color. In the _Die ihr schwebet um diese Palmen_,\r\nfor example, the expressive minor sixth of the voice part on the word\r\n_Qual_, seems to be there by a special dispensation of Providence.\r\nWe know that the interval is one that is characteristic of the main\r\naccompaniment-figure of the song--it has appeared, indeed, as early\r\nas the second bar, and has been frequently repeated since--that it is\r\nalmost inevitable that now and then it should occur in the voice, and,\r\nas a matter of fact, it has already occurred more than once there--at\r\nthe _schwebet_ and _Palmen_ of the first line, for example, and later\r\nat the first syllable of _Himmel_ in the line _Der Himmelsknabe duldet\r\nBeschwerde_. Yet we know very well that it is not a musical accident,\r\nbut a stroke of psychological genius, that brings just this interval\r\nin on the word _Qual_ in the lines _Ach nur im Schlaf ihm leise\r\ngesänftigt die Qual zerrinnt_, the interval indeed being in essence\r\njust what it has been all along, but receiving now a new and more\r\npoignant meaning by the way it is approached. We know very well that\r\nno other song-writer but Wolf would have had the instinct to perceive,\r\nin the midst of the flow of the accompaniment to what seems its own\r\npredestined goal, the expressive psychological possibilities of that\r\nparticular note at that particular moment in that particular line. His\r\nsongs teem with felicities of this kind; they represent the employment\r\nof one of Wagner's most characteristic instruments for uses more subtle\r\neven than he ever dreamt of.\r\n\r\nYet--and the point needs insisting upon, as it is still the subject of\r\nsome misunderstanding--this quick and delicate adaptation of melodic\r\nand harmonic and rhythmic values to the necessities of the poem are not\r\nthe result of a mere calculated policy of 'follow the words.' The song\r\nhas not been shaped simply to permit of this coincidence of verbal and\r\nmusical values, nor have these been consciously worked into the general\r\ntissue of the song after this has been developed on other lines. They\r\nrepresent the spontaneous utterance of a mind to which all the factors\r\nof the song were present in equal proportions from the first bar to the\r\nlast. Wolf made no sketches for his songs; the great majority of them\r\nwere written at a single sitting; the subject possessed him and made\r\nits own language.\r\n\r\nHis independence, his originality, his seminal force for the future\r\nof music, are all best shown by comparing him with Brahms. No one,\r\nof course, will question the greatness of Brahms as a lyrist. But a\r\ncomparison with Wolf at once throws the former's limitations into a\r\nvery strong light. Wolf was much more the man of the new time than his\r\ngreat contemporary. Brahms was the continuer and completer of Schumann,\r\nthe last voice that the older romantic movement found for itself.\r\nBy nature, training, and personal associations he was ill fitted to\r\nassimilate the new life that Wagner was pouring into the music of his\r\nday. Wolf from the first made a clean departure from both the matter\r\nand the manner of Brahms--a cleaner departure, indeed, than Wagner at\r\nfirst made from the romanticism of his contemporaries, for the kinship\r\nbetween the early Wagner and the Schumann of the songs is unmistakable.\r\nWolf's thinking left the mental world of Brahms completely on one side;\r\nhis music is free, for instance, from those touches of sugariness and\r\nof the _larmoyant_ that can be so frequently detected even in the\r\nrugged Brahms, as in all the lyrists who took their stimulus from\r\nromanticism. Brahms' lyric types--his maidens, his students, his\r\nphilosophers, his nature-lovers--are those of Germany in a particular\r\nhistorical phase of her art, literature, and life. With Wolf the lyric\r\nsteps into a wider field. His psychological range is much broader than\r\nthat of Brahms. He creates more types of character and sets them in\r\na more varied _milieu_. With Brahms the same personages recur time\r\nafter time in his songs, expressing themselves in much the same way.\r\nEven an unsympathetic student of Wolf would have to admit that no two\r\nof the personages he draws are the same. The characters of Brahms are\r\nmostly of the same household, with the same heredity, the same physical\r\nappearance, the same mental characteristics, even the same gait. The\r\nman who lies brooding in the summer fields in _Feldeinsamkeit_ is\r\nbrother of the man who loves the maiden of _Wir wandelten_, and first\r\ncousin of the girl who dies to the strains of _Immer leise wird mein\r\nSchlummer_. They all feel deeply but a little sentimentally; they are\r\nall extremely introspective; all speak with a certain slow seriousness\r\nand move about with a certain cumbersomeness. Wolf's men and women are\r\ninfinitely varied, both in the mass and in detail; that is to say, not\r\nonly is his crowd made up of many diverse types, but each type--the\r\nlovers, the thinkers, the penitents, and so on--is full of an inner\r\ndiversity.\r\n\r\nWolf surpasses Brahms again in everything that pertains to the\r\ntechnical handling of the songs. Without wishing to make out that\r\nBrahms was anything but the great singer he undoubtedly was, it must be\r\nsaid frankly that he is too content to work within a frame that he has\r\nfound to be of convenient size, shape, and color, instead of letting\r\nhis picture determine the frame. The quaint accusation is sometimes\r\nbrought against Wolf that he is more of an instrumental writer than\r\na singer, the pianoforte parts of his songs being self-subsistent\r\ncompositions. A devil's advocate might argue with much more force\r\nthat it was Brahms who, in his songs, thought primarily in terms of\r\ninstrumental phrases even for his voices. It is his intentness upon the\r\nbeauty of an abstract melodic line that makes him pause illogically as\r\nhe does after me _Königin_ in the first line of _Wie bist du, meine\r\nKönigin_, thus making a bad break in the poetical sense of the words,\r\nwhich is not really complete until the second line is heard, the _Wie\r\nbist du_ not referring, as many thousands of people imagine, to the\r\n_Königin_, but to the _durch sanfte Güte wonnevoll_ in the next line.\r\nIn other songs, such as _An die Nachtigall_, Brahms yields at the very\r\nbeginning to the fascination of what is unquestionably in itself a\r\nbeautiful phrase, without regard to the fact that it will get him into\r\ndifficulties both of psychology and of 'declamation' as the song goes\r\non, owing to his applying the same kind of musical line-ending to\r\npoetical line-endings that vary in meaning each time. Wolf never makes\r\na primitive blunder of this kind. He sees the poem as a whole before he\r\nbegins to set it; if he adopts at the commencement a figure that is to\r\nrun through the whole song, it is a figure that can readily be applied\r\nto each phase of it without doing psychological violence to any. If at\r\nany point its application involves a falsity, it would be temporarily\r\ndiscarded. Brahms, again, is almost as much addicted to _clichés_\r\nas Schubert, and with less excuse--the _cliché_ of syncopation for\r\nsyncopation's sake; for example, the _cliché_ of a harmonic darkening\r\nof the second or third stanza of a poem, and so on. From limitations\r\nof this sort Wolf is free; his harmonic and rhythmic idioms are as\r\nvaried as his melodic. The great variety of his songs makes it almost\r\nimpossible to cite a few of them as representative of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nFor Wolf the song was the supreme form of expression. In the case of\r\nStrauss the song is only an overflow from the concert and operatic\r\nworks. In spite of the great beauty of some of his songs, such as the\r\n_Ständchen_ and _Seitdem dein Aug_, we are probably justified in saying\r\nthat is not a lyrist _pur sang_. A large number of his songs have\r\nobviously been turned out for pot-boiling purposes. Certain undoubted\r\nsuccesses in the smaller forms notwithstanding, it remains true that he\r\nis at his best when he has plenty of space to work in, and, above all,\r\nwhen he can rely on the backing of the orchestra, as in the splendid\r\n_Pilgers Morgenlied_, and the 'Hymnus.' As a rule, he fails to achieve\r\nWolf's happy balance between the vocal part and the accompaniment; very\r\noften his songs are simply piano pieces with a voice part added as\r\nskillfully as may be, which means sometimes not skillfully at all.\r\n\r\nAmong Max Reger's numerous songs are some of great beauty. He is\r\nsometimes rather too copious to be a thoroughly successful lyrist;\r\nboth the piano and the vocal ideas are now and then in danger of being\r\ndrowned in the flood of notes he pours about them. But when he has\r\nseen his picture clearly and expressed it simply and directly, his\r\nsongs--the _Wiegenlied_ and _Allein_, for example, to mention two of\r\nwidely differing genres--are among the richest and most beautiful of\r\nour time. Mahler poured some of the very best, because the simplest\r\nand truest, of himself into such songs as the _Kindertodtenlieder_,\r\nthe four _Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen_, _Ich atmet einen linden\r\nDuft_, and _Mitternacht_ (from the four Rückert lyrics), and certain\r\nof the settings of the songs from _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_. But the\r\nlist of good, and even very good, song-composers in the Germany of the\r\nlatter half of the nineteenth century is almost endless; it seems,\r\nindeed, as if there were at least one good song in the blood of every\r\nmodern German, just as there was at least one good lyric or sonnet in\r\nthe blood of every Elizabethan poet. From Cornelius to Erich Wolff the\r\nstream has never stopped.\r\n\r\nIn virtually all these men except Erich Wolff, however, the stream has\r\nbeen, as with Strauss, a side branch of their main activity. It was\r\nonly to be expected that the next powerful impulse after Hugo Wolf\r\nwould come from a composer who, like him, gave to the songs the best of\r\nhis mental energies. Joseph Marx resembles Wolf superficially in just\r\nthe way that Wolf superficially resembles Wagner--in the elaboration\r\nand expressiveness of what must still be called, for convenience\r\nsake, the accompaniment to his voice parts. But, while it would be\r\npremature as yet to see in Marx another Wolf, it is certain that we\r\nhave in him a lyrist of considerable individuality. He has managed to\r\nutilize the Wolfian technique and the Wolfian heritage of emotion,\r\nas Wolf utilized those of Wagner, without copying them; they have\r\nbecome new things in his hands. He has also drawn, as Wolf did, upon\r\nquite a new range of poetic theme. He is not so keenly interested as\r\nWolf in the outer world. Wolf, like Goethe, had the eye of a painter\r\nas well as the intuition of a poet, and his music is peculiarly rich\r\nnot only in more or less avowed pictorialism, but in a sort of veiled\r\npictorialism--a pictorialism at one remove, as it were--that conveys\r\na subtle suggestion of the movement or color of some concrete thing\r\nwithout forcing the symbol for it too obtrusively upon our ear.\r\n(Excellent examples are the suggestion of gently drooping boughs and\r\nsoftly falling leaves in _Anakreons Grab_, and, in another style,\r\nthe unbroken thirds from first to last of _Nun wandre, Maria_, so\r\ncharmingly suggestive of the side-by-side journeying of Joseph and\r\nMary.) Marx's music offers us hardly a recognizable example of this\r\npictorialism; his most ambitious effort has been in the _Regen_ (a\r\nGerman version of Verlaine's _Il pleure dans mon cœur_), which is one\r\nof the least successful of his lyrics. Like Wolf, he has called in a\r\nnew harmonic idiom to express new poetic conceptions or new shades of\r\nold ones; but he is apt to become the slave of his own manner, which\r\nWolf never did. His intellectual range, though not equal to that of his\r\ngreat predecessor, is still a fairly wide one--from the luxuriance of\r\nthe splendid _Barcarolle_ to the philosophical warmth of _Der Rauch_,\r\nfrom the bizarrerie of the _Valse de Chopin_ to the humor of _Warnung_,\r\nfrom the earnest introspectiveness of _Wie einst, Hat dich die Liebe\r\nberührt_, the _Japanesisches Regenlied_ and _Ein junger Dichter_ to the\r\nsunny vigor of the _Sommerlied_.\r\n\r\nAmong the rest of the numerous composers--Humperdinck, Henning von\r\nKoss, Hans Sommer (a personality of much charm and some power), Eugen\r\nd'Albert, Weingartner, Bungert, Jean Louis Nicodé (b. 1853), and\r\nothers--each of whom has enriched German music with some delightful\r\nsongs--a special word may be said with regard to two of them--Theodor\r\nStreicher (born 1814) and Erich W. Wolff (died 1913). Streicher follows\r\ntoo faithfully at times in the footprints of the poet--which is only\r\nanother way of saying that the musician in him is not always strong\r\nenough to assert his rights. His work varies greatly in quality. Some\r\nof it is finely imaginative and organically shaped; the rest of it is\r\na rather formless and expressionless series of quasi-illustrations of\r\na poetic idea line by line. He frequently aims at the humorous, the\r\nrealistic or the sententious in a way that a composer with more of the\r\nreal root of music in him would see to be a mere temptation to the art\r\nto overstrain itself. But, though he is perhaps not more than half a\r\nmusician--the other half being poet, prosist, moralist, or what we\r\nwill--that half has produced some good songs, such as the _Fonte des\r\nAmores_, _Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam_, the _Lied des jungen Reiters_,\r\n_Maria sass am Wege_, the _Nachtlied des Zarathustra_, and the\r\n_Weinschröterlied_. Erich Wolff was never more than a minor composer,\r\nbut that he had the genuine lyrical gift is shown by such songs as _Du\r\nbist so jung_, _Sieh, wo du bist ist Frühling_, _Einen Sommer lang_,\r\nand others. He is particularly charming when, as in _Fitzebue_, _Frisch\r\nvom Storch_ and _Christkindleins Wiegenlied_, he exploits the childlike\r\nvein that comes so easily to most Germans, and that has found its most\r\ndelightful modern expression in _Hänsel and Gretel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VI\r\n\r\nA survey of German music at the present day leads to the conclusion\r\nthat, for the moment at any rate, it has come to the end of its\r\nresources. All the great traditions have exhausted themselves. Strauss\r\nhas apparently said all he has to say of value (though, of course, he\r\nmay yet recover himself). Of this he himself seems uneasily conscious.\r\nHis later works exhibit both a tendency to revert to a Mozartian\r\nsimplicity (as in the final stages of _Ariadne auf Naxos_, the duet\r\n_Ist ein Traum, kann nicht wirklich sein_ in _Der Rosenkavalier_,\r\nand elsewhere), and here and there, as in 'The Legend of Joseph,' a\r\ndesire to coquet with the exoticisms of France and the East. All these\r\nlater works suggest that Strauss has partly lost faith in the German\r\ntradition, without having yet found a new faith to take its place. Max\r\nReger is content to sit in the centre of his own web, spinning for\r\never the same music out of the depths of his Teutonic consciousness.\r\nIn opera, in the song, in the symphony, in program music, in chamber\r\nmusic, Germany is apparently doing little more at present than mark\r\ntime. Nevertheless there are undoubtedly germinating forces which will\r\ncome to fruition before long. Perhaps the men now creating will be the\r\ninstruments of the new voice, perhaps their pupils. One or two of the\r\nyounger generation, at any rate, have done things that may justly claim\r\nour attention. One fact may be noticed in this connection: that the\r\nsupremacy seems to have shifted definitely from the North to the South.\r\nMunich and Vienna are, indeed, the new centres, in place of Leipzig and\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nThuille's successor as teacher of composition in the Munich Academy\r\nof Tonal Art, Friedrich Klose (b. 1862), is, as a pupil of Bruckner,\r\nparticularly qualified to represent the South-German branch of the New\r\nGerman school. His single dramatic work, _Ilsebill_, did not succeed\r\nin establishing him among the successful post-Wagnerians. Walter\r\nNiemann[42] speaks of it as showing that his real strength lies in the\r\ndirection of symphonic composition and music for the Catholic Church,\r\nand continues: 'His three-movement symphonic poem _Das Leben ein Traum_\r\n(1899), with organ, women's chorus, declamation and wind instruments,\r\nand in a less degree his _Elfenreigen_, already proved this. Through\r\nhim Hector Berlioz enters modern Munich by the hand of Liszt, Wagner,\r\nand Bruckner, and particularly Berlioz the forest romanticist of the\r\n\"Dance of the Sylphs\" and \"Queen Mab.\" Again and again Klose returns\r\nto church music--with the D minor Mass, the prelude and double fugue\r\nfor organ, lastly, with _Die Wallfahrt nach Kevlaar_. * * * If his\r\nstriving after new forms, the searching in other directions after the\r\ndramatic element which was denied him in the ordinary sense, savors of\r\na strongly experimental character, his music itself is all the less\r\nproblematic. It is honest through and through, warm-blooded, felt and\r\nnatural.' The quiet breadth of his themes, the deep glow of his color\r\nreveals the pupil of Bruckner. His manner of development in sequences,\r\napproaching the 'endless melody,' betrays the disciple of Wagner. A\r\n_Festzug_ for orchestra, _Vidi aquam_ for chorus, orchestra, and organ,\r\nand an 'Elegy' for violin and piano are also among his works.\r\n\r\nSiegmund von Hausegger (b. 1872), son of the distinguished critic\r\nand conductor Friedrich von Hausegger, though he began his creative\r\nactivity in the dramatic field (with _Helfrid_, performed in 1893\r\nin Graz, and _Zinnober_, 1888, in Munich), has earned his chief\r\ndistinction with the symphonic poems _Barbarossa_ (1902) and _Wieland\r\nder Schmied_ (1904). In these he remains true to the Wagnerian\r\nformula, while in his songs he upholds the gospel of Hugo Wolf. A\r\nyouthful _Dyonysische Phantasie_ (1899), which preceded these works,\r\nis characterized by Niemann as 'showing the line of development in\r\nthe direction of a \"kapellmeister music\" in Strauss' style.' Since\r\nthen there have come from his pen a number of fine choruses with\r\norchestra, some for men's voices, others mixed. Hausegger was a pupil\r\nof his father, of Degner, and of Pohlig (in piano) and has achieved\r\na high standing as conductor, first at the Graz opera, 1896-97, then\r\nof the Kaim concerts in Munich (from 1899) and the Museum concerts in\r\nFrankfort.\r\n\r\nA new impulse may one day be given to German music by the remarkable\r\nboy, Erich Korngold (born 1897), who, while quite a child, showed an\r\namazing mastery of harmonic expression and of general technique, and a\r\nnot less amazing depth of thought. It remains to be seen whether, as he\r\ngrows to manhood, he will develop a personality wholly his own (there\r\nare many signs of this already), or whether he will merely relapse into\r\na skilled manipulator of the great traditions of his race. But it is\r\nvain to try to forecast the future of music in Germany or in any other\r\ncountry. Much music will continue to be written that owes whatever\r\nvirtues it may possess merely to a competent exploitation of the racial\r\nheritage. Of this type a fair sample is the _Deutsche Messe_ of Otto\r\nTaubmann (born 1859). On the other hand, something may come of the\r\nrevolt against tradition that is now being led by Arnold Schönberg (b.\r\n1874).\r\n\r\nThis composer seemed destined, in his earlier works, to carry still\r\na stage further the great line of German music; the mind that could\r\nproduce the beautiful sextet _Verklärte Nacht_ and the splendid\r\n_Gurrelieder_ at the age of twenty-five or so seemed certain of a\r\nharmonious development, bringing more and more of its own to build with\r\nupon the permanent German foundation.\r\n\r\nThanks to this complete change of manner, he has become one of the\r\n'sensations' of modern music. And it is still an open question whether\r\nthese later works have a real musical value, or whether they are only\r\nfruitless experiments with the impossible. There are many who say\r\nthat this later Schönberg is a deliberate 'freak.' He found himself\r\noverwhelmed, they say, with the competition in modern music, unable\r\nto make his name known outside of Vienna among the mass of first- and\r\nsecond-rate talents that were flooding the concert halls; he found\r\nalso a public somewhat weary with surplus music and ready to respond\r\nto novelty in any form. What more natural, then, than that he should\r\ndevise works different from anything existing, and gain preëminence by\r\nthe ugliness of his music when he could not by its beauty? This theory\r\nmight be more tenable if Schönberg were a third-rate talent. But there\r\ncan be no question of his great ability as shown in his 'early manner.'\r\nThis manner, based on Wagner and Strauss, was one of great energy\r\nand complexity. It combined the resounding crash of great Wagnerian\r\nharmonies with the sensuous beauty that has always been associated\r\nwith the music of Vienna. The score of the _Gurrelieder_ is one of the\r\nmost complex in existence. But the complexity does not extend to the\r\nharmonic idiom. In this Schönberg was traditional, though by no means\r\nconventional.\r\n\r\nBut there came a time in his development when he began restlessly\r\nsearching for new forms of expression. This he found in a type of\r\nwriting which completely rejects the old harmonic system consecrated\r\nby Bach. The composer concentrates his attention on the interweaving\r\nof the polyphonic voices, unconcerned, apparently, whether or not\r\nthey 'make harmony.' Considered purely as a polyphonic writer in\r\nthis manner he must be allowed to be masterly. His power of logical\r\ntheme-development in a purely abstract way is second only to that of\r\nReger among the moderns. But when this mode of writing is turned to\r\nimpressionistic purposes the result is far more questionable. Up to the\r\npresent time the musical world has by no means decided whether or not\r\nthis is 'music' at all. It is at least probable that its value lies\r\nchiefly in its experimental fruitfulness. Music since Wagner has been\r\ntending steadily toward a negation of the harmonic principles of the\r\nclassics, and there was apparently needed someone who--for the sake of\r\nexperiment at least--would overturn these principles altogether and see\r\nwhat could be developed out of a purely empirical system.\r\n\r\nThe music of the early Schönberg--the Schönberg who literally lived and\r\nstarved in a Viennese cellar--is stimulating in the highest degree.\r\nThe early songs[43] strike a heroic note; they sing with a declamatory\r\nmelody, sometimes rising into inspired lyricism, which seems to say\r\nthat Olympus is speaking. The accompaniment is invariably pregnant\r\nwith energetic comment. But the _Gurrelieder_ is the work on which\r\nSchönberg spent most of his early years. These 'songs' are in reality\r\na long cantata for soli, chorus and orchestra. The text, taken from\r\nthe Danish, tells of King Waldemar, who journeyed to Gurre and there\r\nfound his bride Tove. They lived in bliss for a time, but then Tove\r\ndied and Waldemar cursed God. Tove's voice called to him from the\r\nsong of a bird, and he gathered his warriors together and as armed\r\nskeletons they dashed every night among the woods of Gurre, pursuing\r\ntheir deathly, accursed chase. Tired out with his immense labor, and\r\ndespairing of ever securing production for his work, Schönberg laid\r\naside the _Gurrelieder_ before it was finished. Some years later, when\r\nhe had begun to make a little reputation by his later compositions, his\r\npublisher urged him to finish the work, promising a public performance\r\nwith all the paraphernalia required by the score. This included a\r\nhuge chorus and an orchestra probably larger than any other that a\r\nmusician has ever demanded. The performance was given in Vienna and\r\nestablished Schönberg's European fame. The unity of the work is marred\r\nby the fact that the last quarter of it is written in the composer's\r\n'second manner.' But the great portions of the _Gurrelieder_ must\r\ncertainly rank among the noblest products of modern music. The end of\r\nthe first part, in which Waldemar chides God for being a bad king, in\r\nthat he takes the last penny from a poor subject--this scene throbs\r\nwith a Shakespearean dignity and power. Tove's funeral march and the\r\nscene in which the dead queen speaks from the song of the bird, are\r\nno less inspired. Finally, the work has a text as beautiful as any\r\nwhich a modern composer has found. The other great work of the early\r\nperiod is the sextet, _Verklärte Nacht_, performed in America by the\r\nKneisel Quartet. This takes as a 'scenario' a poem by Richard Dehmel,\r\ntelling how the night was 'transfigured' by the sacrifice of a husband\r\nin allowing his wife freedom in her love. The spiritual story of the\r\npoem is closely followed by the music, though there is no pretense of\r\na close 'argument' or 'program.' The voices of the various characters\r\nare represented by the various solo instruments. Yet this is no mere\r\nprogram music. Judged for itself alone it proves a work of the highest\r\nbeauty, one of the finest things in modern chamber music.\r\n\r\nThe 'Pelléas and Mélisande' is one of the transition works, but\r\npartakes rather of the character of the 'second manner.' The greatest\r\nwork of this period, however, is the first string quartet, performed\r\nin America by the Flonzaley Quartet in the winter of 1913-14. This is\r\n'absolute' music of the purest kind. It does not follow the sonata\r\nform, and its various movements are intermingled (split up, as it\r\nwere, and shaken together), but it shows a strict cogency of structure\r\nand firm sustaining of the mood. The 'second manner' is marked by\r\na mingling, but not a fusing, of the early and later styles. In the\r\nfirst quartet the first fifty bars or so are in the severe later\r\nstyle, in which the polyphony is complexly carried out without regard\r\nto the harmonic implications. In these measures Schönberg shows his\r\ngreat technical skill in the interweaving of voices and the economic\r\ndevelopment of themes. The largo which comes towards the end of the\r\nwork is a passage of magical beauty.\r\n\r\nIn the last period come the _Kammersymphonie_, the second quartet, the\r\ntwo sets of 'Short Piano Pieces,' the 'Five Orchestral Pieces,' and\r\nthe _Pierrot_ melodrame. The _Kammersymphonie_ is in one movement. The\r\nmusic is lively and the counterpoint complex but clear. The quartet\r\ncarries out consistently the absolute non-harmonic polyphony attempted\r\nin the first, but, lacking the poetical passages of the early work,\r\nit has found a stony road to recognition. _Pierrot_ has been heard in\r\ntwo or three European cities and has been voted 'incomprehensible.'\r\nThe 'Five Orchestral Pieces,' performed in America by the Chicago\r\nOrchestra, carry to the extreme Schönberg's unamiable impressionism.\r\nIn them one seeks in vain for any unity or meaning (beauty, in the\r\nold sense, being here quite out of the question). They have, however,\r\na certain unity in the type of materials used and developed in each,\r\nthough their architecture remains a mystery. The 'Short Piano Pieces'\r\n(the earlier ones come, in point of time, in the middle period) have\r\nbeen much admired by the pianist Busoni, who has made a 'concert\r\narrangement' of them, and published them with a preface of his own.\r\nBusoni claims that they have discovered new timbres of the piano, and\r\nevoke in the ear a subtle response of a sort too delicate to have been\r\ncalled forth by the old type of harmony. In general they are like the\r\nOrchestral Pieces in character, seeming always to seek the _outré_\r\nat the expense of the beautiful. Many profess to find a deep and\r\nsubtle beauty in these pieces. But if the empirical harmony which they\r\ncultivate has any validity it must attain that validity by empirical\r\nmeans. It is certain that our ears do not enjoy this music, as they are\r\nat present constituted. But it is possible that as they hear more of\r\nit they may discover in it new values not to be explained by the old\r\nprinciples. But this leads us into the physics of musical æsthetics,\r\nwhich is beyond the scope of this chapter. It should be noted, however,\r\nthat one of the by-products of such a crisis as this in which Schönberg\r\nis playing such an important part, is the stimulation it gives to\r\nmusical theory. If Schönberg succeeds in gaining a permanent place\r\nin music with his 'third manner,' it is certain that all our musical\r\næsthetics hitherto must be reconstructed.\r\n\r\nIn closing our cursory review, we may admit that German music can\r\nafford to shed--may, indeed, be compelled in its own interest to\r\nshed--many of the mental characteristics and the technical processes\r\nthat have made it what it is. There is an end to all things; and there\r\ncomes a time in the history of an art when it is the part of wisdom\r\nto recognize that, as Nietzsche says, only where there are graves are\r\nthere resurrections. The time is ripe for the next great man.\r\n\r\n                                                            E.

Emerging from a generation hampered\r\nby over-regard for convention, vacillating and tentative in technical\r\nmethod in almost all respects save the theatre, and too often\r\nartificial there, a renascence of French music has been assured\r\ncomparable in lucidity of style and markedly racial qualities to the\r\ngolden days of a Couperin or a Rameau, while fearing no contemporary\r\nrival in emotional discrimination and delicate psychological analysis,\r\nand not infrequently attaining a masterly and fundamental vigor. The\r\nFrench composers of to-day have virtually freed dramatic procedures\r\nfrom Italian traditions, and even gradually distanced the Wagnerian\r\nincubus. They have re-asserted a nationalistic spirit in music, with or\r\nwithout dependence on folk-song material, with a potent individuality\r\nof idiom which has not been so persistent since the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. Finally, French critical activity, scholarship,\r\nresearch, educational institutions, standards of performance have risen\r\nto a pitch of excellence formerly denied to all save the Germans.\r\n\r\nWhile the roots of this attainment go back half a century and more,\r\nthe flower of achievement is still so recent as to pique inquiry. It\r\nmust be acknowledged that on the surface no causes are discoverable\r\nwhich are proportionate to the results attained, but closer examination\r\ndiscloses an unmistakable drift. During almost three-quarters of the\r\nnineteenth century, despite the epoch-making work of Berlioz, the\r\nefforts of French composers were centred in one or another of the\r\nforms of opera. Auber, Boieldieu, Meyerbeer and others were succeeded\r\nby Gounod, Thomas and Délibes, leading insensibly to Massenet and\r\nBizet. Gounod's _Faust_ (1859) and _Roméo et Juliette_ (1867), Thomas'\r\n_Mignon_ (1866), Délibes' ballet _Coppélia_ (1870), Massenet's early\r\nwork _Don César de Bazan_ (1872), and Bizet's _Carmen_ (1875), unjustly\r\npilloried as 'Wagnerian,' were typical of the characteristic tendencies\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\nYet it was precisely at a time when Parisians were seemingly engrossed\r\nin the theatre, that signs of radical departure were apparent, and\r\nthese may be fittingly considered the forerunners of the later\r\nstandpoint. Up to nearly the middle of the nineteenth century the\r\n_Concerts du Conservatoire_, themselves the successors to somewhat\r\nanomalous organizations, were the only regular orchestral concerts\r\nin Paris. In 1849 Antoine Seghers reorganized the _Société de Sainte\r\nCécile_, at which works by Gounod, Gouvy, and Saint-Saëns were\r\noccasionally in evidence. In 1851 Jules Pasdeloup founded the _Société\r\ndes Jeunes Artistes du Conservatoire_, merged ten years later into\r\nthe _Concerts Populaires_, which afforded a definite opportunity, if\r\nsomewhat grudgingly accorded, to young French composers. In 1855\r\nJules Armingaud formed a string quartet, later augmented by wind\r\ninstruments, for the popularization of chamber music. He persisted\r\nagainst the obstacles of popular indifference, and ultimately became\r\neven fashionable. About this time also came an awakening in the\r\nstudy of plain-chant and the religious music of the sixteenth and\r\npreceding centuries. In 1853 Niedermeyer founded the _École de Musique\r\nReligieuse_, a significant institution which eventually broadened\r\nits educative scope into a fairly wide survey of musical literature.\r\nOther instrumental organizations of later date, and one particularly\r\nsignificant attempt at educational enfranchisement, will receive\r\nmention at the proper place. The foregoing instances serve to point out\r\nthe seeming paradox of the rise of instrumental music at an apparently\r\nunpropitious time.\r\n\r\nWithout minimizing the genuine impetus given to instrumental music\r\nby the establishment of the foregoing organizations, the trend of\r\nultra-modern French tendencies would have been dubious were it not\r\nfor the preparatory foundation laid by Camille Saint-Saëns, Edouard\r\nLalo and César Franck. Since the work of these men has already been\r\nestimated in previous chapters, it will suffice to indicate the precise\r\nnature of the influence exerted by each.\r\n\r\nSaint-Saëns, possessing marvellous assimilative ingenuity as well as\r\nintellectual virtuosity, brought the contrapuntal manner of Bach, the\r\nforms of Beethoven, and the romanticism of Mendelssohn and Schumann\r\ninto skilled combination with his own somewhat illusive and paradoxical\r\nindividuality. To this he added a wayward fancy for exotic material,\r\nnot treated however in its native spirit, but often in a scholastic\r\nmanner that nevertheless often had a charm of its own. From the\r\npreparatory standpoint his conspicuous virtue lay in the incredible\r\nfertility with which he produced a long series of chamber music\r\nworks, concertos and symphonies possessing such salient qualities\r\nof invention and workmanship as to force their acknowledgment from\r\nthe Parisian public. If his music at its worst is little better than\r\nsterile virtuosity in which individual conviction seems in abeyance,\r\nsuch works as the fifth piano concerto, third violin concerto and\r\nthird symphony (to name a few only) bear a well-nigh classic stamp\r\nin balance between expression and formal mastery. Saint-Saëns, then,\r\npopularized the sonata form, in its various manifestations, by means of\r\na judicious mixture of conventional form and Gallic piquancy, so that\r\na hitherto indifferent public was forced to applaud spontaneously at\r\nlast. If to a later generation Saint-Saëns seems over-conventional and\r\nat times sententious rather than eloquent, we must remember that in\r\nits day his music was thought subversive of true progress, and unduly\r\nTeutonic in its artistic predilections. To-day we ask why he was not\r\nmore unhesitatingly subjective. But possibly that would be expecting\r\ntoo much of a pioneer. Any estimate of Saint-Saëns would be incomplete\r\nwithout mention of his effective championing of the symphonic poem at\r\na period when it was still under suspicion. His four specimens of this\r\ntype show impeccable workmanship, piquant grace, true Gallic economy\r\nin the disposition of his material. They undoubtedly paved the way\r\nfor works of later composers manifesting alike greater profundity of\r\nthought and higher qualities of the imagination.\r\n\r\nEdouard Lalo stands in sharp contrast to Saint-Saëns. He was of an\r\nimpressionable, dramatic temperament, drawn spontaneously toward the\r\nexotic and the coloristic. His Spanish origin betrays itself in the\r\nvivacity of his rhythms, and the picturesque quality of his melodies.\r\nIf indeed the crowning success of a career full of reverses was the\r\nopera _Le Roi d'Ys_ (sketched 1875-6, revised 1886-7) produced in 1888\r\nwhen the composer was sixty-five, his services to instrumental music\r\nare none the less palpable. If Saint-Saëns turns to the exotic as a\r\nrefreshment from a species of intellectual ennui, with Lalo it is the\r\nresult of a fundamental instinct. Lalo's ultimately characteristic vein\r\nis to be found in concertos, of lax if not incoherent form, employing\r\nSpanish, Russian and Norwegian themes, a Norwegian Rhapsody for\r\norchestra, and scintillant suites of nationalistic dances from a ballet\r\n_Namouna_. He became a deliberate advocate of 'local color' treated\r\nwith a veracious and not a conventional atmosphere, in which the\r\nbrilliant orchestral style was more than a casual medium. His salient\r\nqualities were romantic conviction and emotional ardor, in which he\r\nprovided a sincere and positive example whose influence is tangible in\r\nlater composers. Herein lies his historical import.\r\n\r\nIt may seem unnecessary to refer again to the unselfish, laborious yet\r\nexalted personality of César Franck, or needless to rehearse the humble\r\nand patient obscurity of his life for almost thirty years, the gradual\r\nassembling of his devoted pupils, the unfolding of his superb later\r\nworks, and their posthumous general recognition, but it is only through\r\nsuch reiteration that the causes of his position become manifest. For\r\nit is precisely through such vicissitudes that convictions are forged\r\nand that the composers' idiom becomes forcefully eloquent. Franck was\r\nnot content with superficial assimilation of technical procedures,\r\nnor with a facile eclecticism, hence it is the moral character of the\r\nartist which has affected his disciples to a degree even overshadowing\r\nhis technical instruction. Like Saint-Saëns, Franck went directly to\r\nBach for the essence of canonic and fugal style, to Beethoven for the\r\ncardinal principles of the variation and sonata forms. But unlike\r\nSaint-Saëns he did not detach external characteristics and apply\r\nthem half-heartedly; he grasped the basic qualities of the music\r\nhe studied, yet expressed himself freely and elastically in his own\r\nspeech. He taught and practised not the letter but the spirit of style.\r\n\r\nAs regards historic import, Franck's harmonic idiom (while remotely\r\nrelated to that of Liszt), perfectly commensurate with his seraphic\r\nideality, has become infiltrated more or less into the individuality\r\nof all his pupils. Less imitated but of great intrinsic significance\r\nis Franck's virtual reincarnation of the canon, chorale prelude, fugue\r\nand variation forms in terms of modern mystical expressiveness. His\r\ncrowning historical feat was the fusion of hints from Beethoven (fifth\r\nand ninth symphonies), Berlioz's somewhat artificial but suggestive\r\nmanipulation of themes, Liszt's plausible transformation of musical\r\nideas for a programmistic purpose, into an independent solution of\r\nthematic unity employing a 'generative' theme to supply all or nearly\r\nall the thematic material. It may be suggested that Saint-Saëns had\r\nanticipated Franck in this respect (third symphony in C minor), but the\r\nlatter had already worked out the idea in his quintet (1878-79) and\r\nthere are germs of a similar treatment in his first trio (1841).[44] If\r\nFranck's pupils have adopted this idea of thematic variety based upon\r\nunity, in differing degrees of fidelity, this device remains a favorite\r\nprocedure with the Franckist school, and Vincent d'Indy has employed\r\nits resources with conspicuous success.\r\n\r\nBut the secret of Franck's enduring influence does not consist solely\r\nin the genuine creative aspect of his technical mastery despite its\r\nineffaceable example. It lies equally in the pervading morality of\r\nhis æsthetic principles, and in the intrinsic message of his musical\r\nthought. In place of vivacious, piquant but often artificial and\r\nconventionalized emotion of a recognizably Gallic type, he brought to\r\nmusic a serenely mystical Flemish (or, to be more exact, Walloon)\r\ntemperament, a nature naïvely pure and lofty, a character of placid\r\naspiration and consummate trust. His faith moved technical and\r\nexpressive mountains. Through the steadfastly permeating quality of his\r\nartistic convictions he counteracted the superficial and meretricious\r\nelements in French music, and substituted the calm but radiant ideals\r\nof a gospel of beauty which he not only preached but lived in his own\r\nworks. Understood only by the few almost to the hour of his death, he\r\npreceded his epoch so far in fearless self-expression that it seems\r\nalmost inaccurate to characterize him as a preparatory figure. He is\r\nnot only the greatest of these, a forerunner in many respects of a\r\nlater period, but also a prophet to whom one wing of French composers\r\nlook for their inspiration and solace.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing names are not alone in their contributory effect upon\r\nmodern French composers. Among many, a few names may be selected as\r\nworthy of mention. Georges Bizet, essentially of the theatre, in his\r\novertures _Roma_ (1861), _Patrie_ (1875), the suite _Jeux d'Enfants_\r\n(1872), a charming series of miniatures, as well as the classic suites\r\nfrom the incidental music to Daudet's _L'Arlésienne_, disclose a\r\nremarkable and specific gift for instrumental music, whose continuance\r\nwas only limited by his untimely death.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Godard, who presumably may have also died before attaining\r\nthe summit of his powers, was an over-fertile composer of indisputable\r\nmelodic gift and spontaneity of mood, whose most conspicuous defect was\r\nan almost total lack of critical discrimination. In consequence, few of\r\nhis works have survived, and then chiefly for the practical usefulness\r\nof a few pieces for violin or piano.\r\n\r\nJules Massenet, even more emphatically destined for the theatre than\r\nBizet, showed in his early works, such as the overtures _Pompeia_\r\n(1865), _Phèdre_ (1873), _Les Erynnies_ (suite from incidental music\r\nto the drama by Leconte de Lisle, 1873), as well as in numerous\r\norchestral suites and shorter pieces, an unusual instinct for\r\nconcise precision of form, clarity of style, and an extraordinarily\r\ndextrous, if at times coarse, manipulation of the orchestra. But his\r\nsympathies were never with the 'advanced school,' and his influence,\r\na considerable force despite the sneers of critics, has been exerted\r\nalmost entirely in the field of opera.\r\n\r\nAs a further preliminary to the evolution of ultra-modern French\r\nmusic, several important manifestations of progress must be discussed.\r\nThe Franco-Prussian war of 1870, an irretrievable misfortune to the\r\nFrench people politically, acted as a direct and far-reaching stimulus\r\ntoward a nationalistic tendency in music. It led to the rejection\r\nof extra-French influences, that of Wagner among them, although the\r\ncurrent of imitation became ultimately too strong to be resisted. It\r\nbrought about a conscious striving toward individuality in technical\r\nmethods and the deliberate attainment of racial traits in expression.\r\nThe strength and unity of this sentiment among French musicians was\r\nstrikingly exemplified in the founding as early as 1871 of the National\r\nSociety of French Music by Romain Bussine and Camille Saint-Saëns. Its\r\npurpose, as indicated in the device _Ars Gallica_, was to provide for\r\nand encourage the performance of works by French composers, whether\r\nprinted or in manuscript.[45] From the beginning the Society has\r\nstriven amazingly, and it is not too much to assert that its programs\r\nconstitute a literal epitome of French musical evolution and progress.\r\nSaint-Saëns, the first president of the Society, resigned owing to\r\ndisagreement over a policy adopted. César Franck then acted virtually\r\nas president until his death in 1890. Since then Vincent d'Indy has\r\nbeen at its head.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer efforts of Pasdeloup in establishing orchestral concerts\r\nwere ably continued by Édouard Colonne in connection with different\r\norganizations beginning in 1873, and by Charles Lamoureux in 1881.\r\nColonne's great memorial was the efficient popularization of Berlioz,\r\nwhile Lamoureux achieved a like service, not without surmounting almost\r\ninsuperable obstacles, for the music of Wagner. Both coöperated in\r\nencouraging the work of native composers, if less ardently than the\r\nNational Society, still to a sufficient extent to prove to the Parisian\r\npublic the existence of French music of worth. In other respects the\r\neducational achievement of both orchestras has been admirable, and\r\nboth are active to-day, the Colonne concerts being directed by Gabriel\r\nPierné, the Lamoureux concerts by Camille Chevillard.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, Charles Bordes (1863-1905) founded a choral society, _Les\r\nChanteurs de Saint Gervaise_, to spread a knowledge of the choral music\r\nof Palestrina and his epoch, as well as the study of plain-chant. Four\r\nyears later this society was merged into the _Schola Cantorum_, an\r\n_école supérieure de musique_, with Charles Bordes, Alexandre Guilmant\r\nand Vincent d'Indy as founders, to perpetuate the spirit and teachings\r\nof César Franck. Intended originally as an active protest against the\r\nsuperficial standpoint of the Conservatoire before the administration\r\nof Gabriel Fauré, the _Schola_ aims to have the pupil pass through the\r\nentire course of musical evolution with a curriculum of exhaustive\r\nthoroughness. Aside from the practicability or the æsthetic soundness\r\nof this theory, the _Schola_ attempts to furnish a comprehensive\r\neducation that is praiseworthy in its aims. Further than this the\r\nattitude of the _Schola_ possesses an historical import in that it\r\nembodies a deliberate reaction against the revolutionary tendencies of\r\nDebussy and Ravel, and aims to conserve the outlook of Franck.\r\n\r\nTo complete the preparatory influences bearing upon ultra-modern French\r\nmusic one should mention more than tentatively the palpable stimulation\r\nof the so-called 'Neo-Russian School' comprising Balakireff, Borodine,\r\nRimsky-Korsakoff, Cui, and more particularly Moussorgsky. While these\r\nmen have reacted more noticeably upon individuals rather than upon\r\nmodern French composers as a group, their example has been none the\r\nless tangible. Russian sensitiveness as to orchestral timbre, their use\r\nof folk-song, their predilection for novel rhythms, exotic atmosphere,\r\nhave all appealed to the receptive sensibilities of the ultra-modern\r\nFrench composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThe pioneers of ultra-modern French music are Emmanuel Chabrier and\r\nGabriel Fauré, men of strikingly dissimilar temperaments and equally\r\nremote style and achievement. Each is, however, equally significant in\r\nhis own province.\r\n\r\nAlexis-Emmanuel Chabrier (1841-94) was born at Ambert (Puy-de-Dôme) in\r\nthe South of France. One can at once infer his temperament from his\r\nbirthplace. For Chabrier combined seemingly irreconcilable elements:\r\nrobust vigor, ardent sincerity and intense impressionability. With an\r\ninexpressible sense of humor, he possessed a delicate and distinguished\r\npoetic instinct side by side with deeply human sentiments. His early\r\nbent toward music was only permitted with the understanding that it\r\nremain an avocation. Accordingly Chabrier came to Paris to be educated\r\nat the age of fifteen, obtained his lawyer's certificate when he\r\nwas twenty-one and forthwith entered the office of the Ministry of\r\nthe Interior. In the meantime he had acquired astonishing skill as\r\na pianist, studied harmony and counterpoint, made friends with many\r\npoets, painters and musicians, among them Paul Verlaine, Édouard\r\nManet, Duparc, d'Indy, Fauré and Messager. 'Considered up to then\r\nas an amateur,'[46] Chabrier surprised professional Paris with an\r\nopéra comique in three acts, _L'Étoile_ (1877) (played throughout\r\nthis country _without_ authorization and _with_ interpolated music\r\nby Francis Wilson as 'The Merry Monarch'), and a one-act operetta,\r\n_L'Éducation manquée_ (1879), both of which were described as\r\n'exceeding in musical interest the type of piece represented.'[47]\r\nA visit to Germany with Henri Duparc, where he heard _Tristan und\r\nIsolde_, affected his impressionable nature so deeply that he\r\nresolved to give himself entirely to music and in 1880 resigned from\r\nhis position at the Ministry. (His paradoxical character was never\r\nmore succinctly illustrated than by the fact that he later composed\r\n'Humorous Quadrilles on Motives from Tristan.')[48]\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Chabrier became secretary and chorus master for the newly\r\nfounded Lamoureux concerts, and helped to produce portions of\r\n_Lohengrin_ and _Tristan_. During this year he composed the 'Ten\r\nPicturesque Pieces' for piano, from which he made a _Suite Pastorale_,\r\nin which the orchestral idiom was not always skillful. From his\r\nposition in the Lamoureux orchestra he soon learned the secrets of\r\norchestral effect from their source. In 1882 he went to Spain, notebook\r\nin hand, and in the following year burst upon the Parisian public with\r\na brilliant rhapsody for orchestra on Spanish themes entitled _España_.\r\nThis highly coloristic, poetic and impassioned piece at once placed\r\nhim in the front rank of contemporary French composers, and remains a\r\nlandmark in a new epoch for its conviction, spontaneous inspiration,\r\nrhythmic vitality and individual treatment of the orchestra. If Lalo\r\nhad shown the way, Chabrier at once surpassed the older musician on\r\nhis own ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years Chabrier produced some of his most\r\ncharacteristic works, the 'Three Romantic Waltzes' for two pianos, one\r\nof which evoked enthusiasm from a Parisian wit for its 'exquisite bad\r\ntaste,' a remarkable idyllic _scena_ for solo, chorus and orchestra,\r\n_La Sulamite_, a _Habañera_, transcribed for piano and also for\r\norchestra. But by far the most ambitious work of these years was a\r\nserious opera _Gwendoline_ on a text by Catulle Mendès, produced at the\r\nThéâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1886. Unfortunately the artistic\r\nsuccess of this opera was abruptly closed by the bankruptcy of the\r\nmanagement. But Germany received _Gwendoline_ with marked favor, and it\r\nwas performed at Karlsruhe, Leipzig, Dresden, Munich and Düsseldorf.\r\n\r\n_Gwendoline_, despite some obvious defects, is a work of unusual\r\nhistorical import, since it constitutes the first thorough-going\r\nattempt, aside from the tentative efforts of Reyer, Bizet, Massenet\r\nand others, to incorporate the dramatic reforms of Wagner in an\r\nopera of distinctively French character. Mendès' poem on a legendary\r\nsubject is frankly imitative of scenes and characters from Wagner's\r\nmusic dramas. Chabrier as frankly uses leading-motives, yet he does\r\nnot conform slavishly to the Wagnerian symphonic treatment of them.\r\nMoreover Chabrier is under an equal obligation to Wagner in the use\r\nof the orchestra, if indeed there are many pages and scenes which are\r\nunmistakably Gallic in their delicacy of conception and in individual\r\ncolor effects. Indeed, there was nothing in Chabrier's previous career\r\nto presuppose such genuine dramatic gifts, such fanciful poetry or such\r\ndepths of sentiment as are to be discovered in this work, even though\r\nMendès' text is commonplace, and his drama too ill-proportioned to\r\nform the basis of a satisfactory opera. It cannot be denied that the\r\napotheosis of the dying lovers at the end of Act II is somewhat tawdry\r\nand mock heroic in the persistent use of a banal theme; on the other\r\nhand, the opening chorus of Act I, Gwendoline's ballad in the same\r\nact, the delicate sensibility of the prelude to Act II, the charming\r\nbridal music including the tender _Epithalame_ in the same act, all go\r\nto establish the intrinsic value and the pioneer force of the work.\r\n_Gwendoline_ is and remains a magnificent experiment, which still\r\npreserves much of its vitality intact.\r\n\r\nJustifiably discouraged, if not overmastered, by the misfortunes\r\nattending the production of _Gwendoline_, Chabrier nevertheless brought\r\nout in the following year (1887) an opéra comique, _Le Roi malgré lui_,\r\nin which the lyric charm, vivacity and humor of the music achieved an\r\ninstant success. Within a few days, however, the Opéra Comique burned\r\nto the ground. Despite this crushing blow, Chabrier continued to\r\npersist in composition. He published many songs, fantastic, grotesque\r\nand sentimental, among them the inimitable 'Villanelle of the Little\r\nDucks,' a poignant and exquisitely lyric chorus for women's voices and\r\norchestra, 'To Music' (1890), a rollicking _Bourée fantasque_ (1891)\r\nfor piano, one of the boldest and most paradoxical instances of his\r\ncombining of humor and poetic atmosphere. In addition he was working\r\nfeverishly at another opera, _Briseis_, which he hoped to make his\r\nmasterpiece, when his health gave way. When, after appalling struggles,\r\nChabrier had induced the Opéra to give _Gwendoline_ late in 1893,\r\nhe was too ill to realize or participate in his success and in the\r\nfollowing year he died.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature in Chabrier's art was his uncompromising\r\nsincerity and directness. He expressed himself in his music with\r\nundeviating fidelity, despite the shattering of conventions involved.\r\nHerein lies the intrinsic value of his music, and the potency of\r\nhis example. Whether his medium were a humorous song, a fantastic\r\npiano-piece, a pastoral idyl or a tragic drama, he followed his\r\ncreative impulse with an outspoken daring not to be equalled since that\r\nstormy revolutionary, Berlioz. Chabrier possessed a positive genius for\r\ndance-rhythms and humorous marches which he redeemed from coarseness\r\nby surprising turns of melodic and harmonic inventiveness. Thus the\r\n_choeur dansé_ from the second act of _Le Roi malgré lui_, the first of\r\nthe 'Three Romantic Waltzes,' the witty _Joyeuse Marche_ and finally\r\n_España_ are genuinely classics, despite their lack of 'seriousness.'\r\nBut Chabrier was equally epoch-making in the sincerity and glamour with\r\nwhich he painted lyric moods of poetic intensity and extremely personal\r\nsentiment. Gwendoline's ballad, the bridal music and _Epithalame_\r\nfrom the same opera, _La Sulamite_ and _À la Musique_ display an\r\nastonishing variety in scope of sentiment for the robust and almost\r\nover-exuberant composer of _España_ and the _Bourée fantasque_. In\r\nsensuous and poignant imaginativeness again, Chabrier is the forerunner\r\nto a considerable extent of the later group whose essential purpose\r\nwas truthfulness of atmosphere. While as a dramatic composer Chabrier\r\nfollowed deliberately in the footsteps of Wagner, his own expressive\r\nindividuality maintained itself as persistently as could be expected\r\nfrom the force of the spell to which it was subjected. Also, Chabrier\r\nwas in this respect but one of many, and not until the fusion of\r\nWagnerian method and French individuality had been tried out, could the\r\nnative composer at last enfranchise himself. Harmonically, Chabrier was\r\nbold and defiant in a generation which was submissive to convention.\r\nWith an idiom essentially his own, he foreshadowed many so-called\r\ninnovations in sequences of seventh chords, the use of ninths,\r\nstartling modulations, and even a preparing of the whole-tone scale. In\r\nshort, Chabrier's legacy to French music was that of a self-confident\r\npersonality, daring to express himself with total unreserve in an\r\nassimilative age which deferred to public taste and superficialities of\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nBetween Chabrier and Gabriel Fauré there can be no comparison, and\r\nno parallel save that both have exerted a constructive influence\r\non modern French music. Where Chabrier was high-spirited almost to\r\nboisterousness, Fauré is suave, urbane, polished, a man of society\r\nwho nevertheless preserves curiously poetic and mystical instincts.\r\nBorn in 1845 at Pamiers, in that district known as the _Midi_, he is\r\nof the reflective rather than the spontaneous type. Meeting with a\r\nrelatively slight opposition from his father in cultivating his early\r\nmanifested gift for music, he came to Paris when only nine years of\r\nage and studied for eleven years at Niedermeyer's _École de Musique\r\nReligieuse_. He studied first with Pierre Dietsch, who is remembered\r\nchiefly for his purchase of Wagner's text to 'The Flying Dutchman' and\r\nfor the inconspicuous success of his music, then with Saint-Saëns, who\r\ndrilled him thoroughly in Bach and the German romanticists. After four\r\nyears' incongenial work at Rennes, as organist and teacher (in the\r\nlatter capacity watchful mothers were loath to confide their daughters'\r\neducation to the attractive youth), he served in the Franco-Prussian\r\nwar. Then, returning to Paris, he occupied various positions in\r\nParisian churches before settling finally at the Madeleine. From 1877\r\nto 1889 he made several trips to Germany to see Liszt and to hear\r\nWagner's music. During these journeys he won glowing comments from such\r\ndiverse personalities as von Bülow, César Cui and Tschaikowsky. In 1896\r\nhe became teacher of composition at the Paris Conservatory; in 1905\r\nhe became director, and still holds this position. He has thoroughly\r\nreorganized the Conservatory, enlarged the scope of its curriculum,\r\nespecially as regards composition, and has accomplished significant\r\nresults as a teacher.\r\n\r\nFauré has not been equally successful in every field of composition.\r\nHis development has been inward. He is first and foremost a composer\r\nof songs, and his attainment in this direction alone would maintain\r\nhis position. He has been a fertile writer of piano pieces. Many of\r\nthem are disfigured by a light salon style; a considerable number,\r\nhowever, are of intrinsically poetic expression. Despite respectable\r\nachievements in chamber music (he has been awarded prizes), the quintet\r\nfor piano and strings op. 89 (1906) is the one outstanding work which\r\nis conspicuous in modern French music, although the early violin\r\nsonata, op. 13 (1876), had its day of popularity. He has written some\r\nagreeable choral music, of which the cantata 'The Birth of Venus'\r\nis notable if unequal. There is noble music in the Requiem op. 48\r\n(1887) and the final number _In Paradisum_ is an exceptionally fine\r\ninstance of mystical expression. Fauré's orchestral music is relatively\r\ninsignificant, and his incidental music to various dramas has not left\r\na permanent mark, save for the thoroughly charming suite arranged\r\nfrom the music to _Pelléas et Mélisande_ op. 80 (1898). Not until the\r\nperformance of _Pénélope_ (1913) at Monte Carlo and Paris has Fauré\r\naccomplished a successful opera.\r\n\r\nIn song-writing, however, Fauré has achieved a remarkable distinction\r\nnot exceeded by any of his countrymen. Some of the early songs\r\ndating from the years spent at Rennes, as _Le Papillon et la Fleur_\r\nand _Mai_, suggest naturally enough the influence of Saint-Saëns.\r\nOthers in the first volume, _Sérénade Toscane_, _Après un rêve_, and\r\n_Sylvie_, show clearly a growing independence, while _Lydia_ in its\r\ndelicate archaism foreshadows Fauré's later achievements in this\r\nstyle. From 1880 onwards, Fauré at once launches into his own subtle\r\nand fascinating vein. If some of the songs in a second volume suggest\r\nthe _salon_ as do many of the piano pieces, they have a peculiar\r\nelegance of mood and a finesse of workmanship which elevate them above\r\nany hint of vulgarity. Such are the songs _Nell_, _Rencontre_ and\r\n_Chanson d'Amour_. But there are many songs in the same volume which\r\nbespeak eloquently Fauré's higher gifts for lyrical interpretation and\r\nimaginative delineation of mood. Among these the most salient are _Le\r\nSecret_ (1882), remarkable for its intimate sentiment, _En Prière_,\r\ndelicately mystical though slightly sentimental, _Nocturne_ (1886),\r\nwhich is original in its harmonic idiom; _Clair de Lune_ (1887),\r\nadroitly suggestive of Verlaines' Watteauesque text; _Les Berceaux_\r\n(1882), expansive in its human emotion; and _Les Roses d'Ispahan_,\r\nreplete with an impassioned exoticism. In a third volume are two songs\r\nwhich show Fauré's individuality in a significantly broader scope.\r\nThese are _Au cimitière_ (1889), a profound elegy, typical of the\r\noutspoken lamentation of the Latin temperament, and _Prison_, in which\r\nthe tragic emotion is heightened by an intensely declamatory style.\r\nFauré has published other sets of songs, among them _La Bonne Chanson_\r\n(1891-92), texts by Verlaine, and _La Chanson d'Ève_ (1907-10), texts\r\nby Charles Van Lerbergle, which contain many striking specimens of his\r\ndelicate lyricism, but none more significant, except possibly from the\r\nvirtue of added maturity, than those already mentioned. As a whole, the\r\nimaginative and expressive traits of Fauré's songs are partially due to\r\nhis unerring instinct in the choice of texts by the most distinguished\r\nFrench poets, including Leconte de Lisle, Villiers de Lisle-Adam, Paul\r\nVerlaine, Jean Richepin, Sully-Prudhomme, Armand Silvestre, Charles\r\nGrandmougin, Charles Baudelaire and others.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Fauré has vitalized the song as no\r\nFrench composer had done hitherto, and that his influence has been\r\nparamount among his younger contemporaries despite divergences of\r\nindividuality. Furthermore, weighing the differences of race and\r\ntemperament, they can be successfully compared with the German\r\nromanticists. If they do not scale the same heights, sound the same\r\ndepths, or approach the artless simplicity of German lyricism, their\r\npoetry is far more subtle, imaginative and varied in its infinite\r\ndifferentiation of mood. In these songs are the manifestations of suave\r\nelegance, individual perfume, sometimes sensuous, sometimes mystical,\r\na singularly poetic essence expressed in music that delights alike by\r\nits refined workmanship, melodic and harmonic ingenuity. In his songs,\r\nFauré is at once transitory and definitive; he begins experimentally,\r\nbut soon attains ultra-modern significance.\r\n\r\n_Pénélope_, text by Réné Fauchois, is a lyric drama presenting the\r\nlegend of Ulysses' return with a few unessential variants. It does\r\nnot attempt therefore a drama of large outlines, but is content to\r\nremain within the scope prescribed by its frame. Fauré also has wisely\r\nfollowed within similar lines as being the more compatible with his\r\nlyric talent. Nevertheless we find in many episodes the distinguished\r\ninvention which marks his songs, a style which if somewhat too\r\nrestrained is nevertheless adequate. The first act contains many\r\npassages of lyrical and emotional charm, but not until the climax\r\nof the third act (the slaying of the suitors) does Fauré arrive at\r\ngenuine intensity. If _Pénélope_ cannot be classed with _Pelléas et\r\nMélisande_ or _Louise_, if it does not convince one that Fauré is a\r\nborn dramatist, it contains too much that is poignantly beautiful to be\r\ndismissed hastily. Furthermore it possesses distinct historical import\r\nas owing virtually nothing to the thralldom of Wagnerism. From this\r\nstandpoint it marks a conscious path of effort which has engaged French\r\ncomposers for thirty years or so.\r\n\r\nIf some critical attention should rightfully be given Fauré's Elegy\r\nfor violoncello and piano op. 24 (1883), the quintet, one of his\r\nnoblest and most individual works, the Requiem, the incidental music\r\nto _Pelléas et Mélisande_, these omissions are purposely made to\r\nconcentrate appreciation on Fauré as a song writer. If he is a\r\nsignificant figure among French musicians of to-day on the intrinsic\r\nmerits of his creative fancy, he deserves none the less to be recorded\r\nas an important innovator from the technical standpoint. He has\r\nadapted, either literally or freely, modal harmony to lyrical or\r\ndramatic suggestion. If Saint-Saëns had already done this in his third\r\nsymphony (finale), Fauré has employed this medium with greater fluidity\r\nand poetic connotation. Moreover this device has been partially\r\nimitated by Debussy. In his use of secondary sevenths in conventional\r\nsequence, the use of altered chords suggesting the whole-tone scale,\r\nof ninths, elevenths and thirteenths, he has gone beyond Chabrier,\r\nand furnished many a hint to later composers. He is also original and\r\nevolutionary in his ingeniously transitory modulations, adding a spice\r\nof surprise to his music. A conspicuous defect, on the other hand, is\r\nhis abuse of the sequence, melodic or harmonic, a shortcoming which\r\nhas been transmitted in some degree to his pupil, Maurice Ravel. But\r\nafter all critical cavilling and analysis of his harmonic originality\r\nhis enduring charm and sincerity of sentiment defy analysis or\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nIf the pupils of César Franck are regarded to-day as constituting a\r\ndefinitely reactionary wing in French music, they had in their youth\r\nto contend with bitter and outspoken criticism for their propagation\r\nof dangerously 'modern' tendencies. On the one hand, they were\r\nunder suspicion for their uncompromising fidelity to their master's\r\ntechnical and æsthetic tenets, on the other they were abused for their\r\neager receptivity to Wagnerian principles in dramatic reform and use\r\nof the orchestra. In addition, they had to justify the innovating\r\nfeatures (both harmonically and melodically) of their own definite\r\nindividualities.\r\n\r\nTo-day we can look back at the struggle and see that in reality they\r\nwere contending for principles essentially moderate and even classical\r\nin drift, especially when viewed in the light of more revolutionary\r\nyounger contemporaries. We realize that in the main the influence of\r\nWagner was enormously salutary, even if it postponed considerably\r\nthe final achievement of a positively nationalistic dramatic idiom.\r\nThe lesson of an opera which should genuinely unite music and drama,\r\nof an orchestral style at once of greater scope and of finesse in\r\nillustrative detail, was sadly needed. Moreover it became at last an\r\nhonor to have been a pupil of Franck, and many claimed this distinction\r\nwho were not genuine disciples in reality. In addition there were\r\nsome, like Augusta Holmès, who studied under Franck but who were never\r\nmaterially influenced by him, just as there were others like Paul Dukas\r\nwho showed the imprint of Franck's methods without actually having been\r\nhis pupil. Vincent d'Indy thus enumerates the real pupils of Franck:\r\nCamille Bênoit, Pierre de Bréville, Albert Cahen, Charles Bordes,\r\nAlexis de Castillon, Ernest Chausson, Arthur Coquard, Henri Duparc,\r\nAugusta Holmès, Vincent d'Indy, Henri Kinkelmann, Guillaume Lekeu,\r\nGuy Ropartz, Louis de Serres, Gaston Vallin and Paul de Wailly. Of\r\nthese de Castillon, Chausson, Duparc, d'Indy, Lekeu and Ropartz may be\r\nconsidered as representative, and d'Indy by virtue of the totality of\r\nhis activity is entitled to first consideration.\r\n\r\nVincent d'Indy, born at Paris, March 27, 1851, of a family of ancient\r\nnobility coming from Ardèche in the Cévennes, has steadily maintained\r\nan attitude of intellectual aristocracy toward his art, although\r\nlike his master Franck he has labored most democratically for the\r\nadvancement of musical education.[49] Left motherless when an infant,\r\nd'Indy was brought up by his grandmother, Mme. Théodore d'Indy, of\r\nwhom he likes to record that she had 'known Grétry and Monsigny, and\r\nshown a keen appreciation of Beethoven in 1825.'[50] It was owing\r\nto her that d'Indy came early in contact with the music of Bach and\r\nBeethoven. Piano lessons under Diemer occupied him from the age of\r\nten onwards, and after 1865 he studied piano and harmony at the Paris\r\n_Conservatoire_ with Marmontel and Lavignac. But d'Indy was also\r\ngenuinely interested in composition, and by 1870 he finished and\r\npublished some piano pieces, a short work for baritone and chorus,\r\nand projected others of varying dimensions. When the Franco-Prussian\r\nwar broke out, d'Indy enlisted and served throughout. After the\r\nwar he took up the study of law in a half-hearted manner, but his\r\nintroduction by Henri Duparc to César Franck in 1872 settled his\r\nmusical career definitely. While Franck criticized severely the piano\r\nquartet that d'Indy brought him, he was quick to perceive the latent\r\nqualities of the young composer. Forthwith d'Indy studied the organ\r\nwith Franck at the _Conservatoire_, but recognizing the inadequate\r\nopportunity of obtaining any technical drill in composition at this\r\ninstitution, he became Franck's private pupil. With him he worked\r\nfaithfully and pertinaciously, and received not only an exhaustive\r\ntechnical grounding, but an illuminating æsthetic comradeship rich\r\nin comprehensive discussions of art-principles. D'Indy soon joined\r\nthe _Société Nationale de Musique Française_ and became an energetic\r\nworker in its behalf, being secretary for nearly ten years and becoming\r\npresident after the death of Franck in 1890. Under his leadership the\r\nSociety has wonderfully extended its activity. In 1873 he spent a\r\nfruitful month with Liszt at Weimar; in 1876 he heard a performance\r\nof 'The Ring of the Nibelungs' at Bayreuth, and in 1881 he heard\r\n'Parsifal.' From 1873 to 1878 he was kettle-drummer and chorus-master\r\nin Colonne's orchestra, and in 1887 chorus-master for Lamoureux,\r\nboth exceedingly valuable practical experiences. In 1885 the city of\r\nParis awarded d'Indy the first prize for his choral work _Le Chant de\r\nla Cloche_, whose reception in the following year placed him in the\r\nfront rank of French composers. In 1896 d'Indy with Charles Bordes\r\nand Alexandre Guilmant founded the _Schola Cantorum_ as an _école\r\nsupérieure de musique_,[51] to perpetuate the spirit and practical\r\nessence of Franck's teachings, to restore the study of plain-chant\r\nand the music of the Palestrinian epoch to its proper dignity, and\r\nto include in its curriculum masterpieces from the fifteenth to the\r\nnineteenth centuries. With the death of Bordes in 1909 (compelled by\r\nreason of ill health to live in the south of France, where he founded a\r\nbranch of the Schola at Montpellier in 1905) and of Guilmant in 1911,\r\nd'Indy became sole director of the Schola. In this position he has been\r\nprodigal of thought and strength.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend the nature of d'Indy's evolution, it is essential to\r\ndetail some of the more significant influences reacting upon him.\r\nBrought up in a cultivated milieu, d'Indy absorbed Goethe, Schiller,\r\nHerder and Lessing, while not a few of his works are founded on their\r\nwritings. The German romantic musicians, Mendelssohn, Schumann and\r\nWeber, affected him fairly acutely for a while, but in a transitory\r\nfashion. While the spell exercised by Franck on d'Indy is both deep and\r\npermanent, it could not prevent his instant recognition of the import\r\nof Wagner's dramatic procedures, including the magical euphony of\r\nhis orchestration. While there remains of this 'Wagnerianism' only the\r\nnormal residue that comes with the acceptance of a great historical\r\nfigure, d'Indy's music continued to show in method or suggestion his\r\nadmiration and close study of Wagner. That this is no longer the case\r\nis due partly to the natural ripening of individuality consequent upon\r\nmaturity, and also to the Schola. With the profound study of liturgic\r\nmusic and the literature of the sixteenth century, d'Indy has reverted\r\nto ecclesiastic counterpoint as a logical foundation for technique\r\ndespite his adaptation of its principles to a free and modernistic\r\nexpression. Moreover, he has used plain-chant melodies to an increasing\r\nextent in instrumental or dramatic works. Thus his music has taken on\r\na spiritual and humanitarian character, analogous in inward motive if\r\nmarkedly different in outward sentiment from that of his master.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: Modern French Composers:]\r\n\r\n             Emanuel Chabrier     Vincent d'Indy\r\n              Maurice Ravel     Gustave Charpentier\r\n\r\nApart from a relatively small amount of miscellaneous works for\r\nchorus, piano, etc., the greater portion of d'Indy's productivity\r\ncan be divided into two general classes, instrumental (orchestral or\r\nchamber music) and dramatic (choral works or operas). Moreover he\r\nturns (seemingly with deliberate purpose) from one pole to another\r\nof the musical field. If the examination of d'Indy's chief works in\r\nchronological order would give the best clue to his evolutionary\r\nprogress, the consideration of each type by itself has perhaps greater\r\nclarity.\r\n\r\nD'Indy's earliest published instrumental music, the piano quartet op.\r\n7 (1878-88) and the symphonic ballad _La Forêt enchantée_ after Uhland\r\n(1878), show him to be too concerned in mastering the technique of\r\nhis art to be preoccupied as to individuality. Of this the quartet\r\ncontains more, although not of an assertive order, together with a\r\nsedulous attention to detail. _La Forêt enchantée_ is well planned\r\nand effectively carried out in a spontaneous adolescent manner, with\r\ndistinct Teutonic reflections in the general atmosphere. This is all\r\nchanged with the 'Wallenstein Trilogy' (1873-81), three symphonic\r\npoems after Schiller's drama. The subject has struck fire in d'Indy's\r\nimagination. _Le Camp de Wallenstein_ is a kaleidoscope of passing\r\nscenes hit off with apt characterization, dramatic touches and no\r\nlittle orchestral brilliancy. _Max et Thecla_ (the earliest of d'Indy's\r\norchestral works), performed as _Ouverture des Piccolomini_ in 1874,\r\nremodelled to form the second part of the trilogy, contains all too\r\nobvious traces of ineptitude, side by side with pages of genuine\r\nromantic sensibility. _La Mort de Wallenstein_ is musically the\r\nstrongest of the three, and the ablest in technical and expressive\r\nmastery, despite echoes of the _Tarnhelm_ motif in the introduction\r\nand the palpably Franckian canonic treatment of the chief theme. In\r\ninventiveness, dramatic force and markedly skillful orchestration, the\r\ntrilogy is prophetic of later attainments.\r\n\r\nThe _Poème des Montagnes_ op. 15 (1881) for piano deserves mention\r\nbecause it is one of a number of works concerned with aspects of\r\nnature, a source of evocatory stimulus upon d'Indy in a number of\r\ninstances. There are romantic qualities of some grandeur in these\r\npieces, as well as dramatic vitality in one idea which d'Indy\r\nappropriately used in a later work,[52] but as a whole they do not rank\r\nwith his best music. If a poetic mood is apparent in _Saugefleurie_ op.\r\n21 (1884) and a vein of piquant fancy is to be found in the suite op.\r\n24 for trumpet, flutes and strings, both are not unjustly to be ranked\r\nchiefly as steps leading to works of larger significance.\r\n\r\nAfter _Le Chant de la Cloche_, whose performance brought instant\r\nrecognition to d'Indy, the 'Symphony on a Mountain Air' op. 25 (1886)\r\nfor piano and orchestra is the first instance of d'Indy's deliberate\r\nresolve to follow in the footsteps of Franck as regards formal and\r\nthematic treatment. The basis of the work is a true folk-song[53] which\r\nfurnishes through rhythmic and melodic modification the principal\r\nthemes of the symphony. Here we find more assertive individuality than\r\nin any instrumental work since the Wallenstein trilogy, a genuine\r\ncapacity for logical developments, thoughtful sentiment in the slow\r\nmovement, and great animation in the vivid Kermesse which forms the\r\nfinale. Similarly the trio op. 29 (1887) for clarinet, violoncello and\r\npiano adopts the Franckian method while permitting an equal freedom of\r\npersonal idiom. Again passing over minor works for the piano, a few\r\nchoral or vocal pieces which have a contributory rather than a capital\r\nimport, and leaving momentarily the opera _Fervaal_, d'Indy's next\r\nstriking contribution to instrumental music is the set of symphonic\r\nvariations _Istar_, op. 42 (1896). The program of the work, taken from\r\nthe Epic of Izdubar, is concerned with the descent of _Istar_ into\r\nthe Assyrian abode of the dead to rescue her lover, leaving a garment\r\nor ornament with the guardian of each of seven gates, until naked she\r\nhas fulfilled the test and restores her lover. Accordingly d'Indy\r\nhas adroitly reversed the variations from the complex to the simple,\r\nto describe the gradual spoliation of the heroine, until the theme\r\nat last emerges in a triumphal unison depicting the nudity of Istar.\r\nThe variations are in themselves of great ingenuity, of picturesque\r\ndetail and gorgeous orchestral color, but the descriptive purpose is\r\nsomewhat marred by the artificialities of technical manipulation. Heard\r\nas absolute music, the intrinsic qualities of the piece delight the\r\nlistener and its uncompromising individuality shows the progressive\r\nmaturity of the composer.\r\n\r\nIn a second string quartet, op. 45 (1897), d'Indy's inventive\r\nfertility in evolving not only the chief themes but accompaniment\r\nfigures from a motto of four notes, gives further evidence of his\r\nskill along the lines suggested by Franck. Certain episodes and even\r\nentire movements give cause for suspicion that the composer was drawn\r\nto the realization of technical problems rather than that of concrete\r\nexpression. The contrapuntal texture of the quartet undoubtedly\r\nproceeds from a source anterior to Franck, that of the counterpoint\r\nof the sixteenth century to which d'Indy has reverted more and more\r\nsince his connection with the Schola. But it is combined with a\r\nsuperstructure of personal and modernistic expression upon classical\r\nand Franckian models in such a way as to achieve a notable beauty. If\r\nthe _Chanson et Danses_, op. 50 (1898), for wind instruments, is laid\r\nout in small forms, its singular purity of style and its spontaneous\r\nmastery of a difficult medium make it of greater weight than its scope\r\nwould indicate.\r\n\r\nD'Indy's instrumental masterpiece, the Symphony in B-flat, op. 57\r\n(1902-3), easily marks the summit of his achievement in this field. If,\r\nfrom a technical standpoint, it surpasses anything hitherto attained\r\nby its composer in logic and elasticity of form, subtle and compelling\r\ndevelopment of themes from its generative phrases, clarity of style\r\ndespite its external complexity, its creative inventiveness, richness\r\nof detail, profundity of sentiment and genial orchestration are of\r\nequal magnitude. With the climax of the finale, a chorale derived from\r\na theme in the introduction to the first movement, d'Indy attains a\r\ncomprehensive sublimity that is not only unique in modern French music,\r\nbut which is difficult to find surpassed in the contemporary symphonic\r\nliterature of any nation. While the piano and violin sonata, op. 59\r\n(1903-4), by reason of its smaller dimensions, can scarcely be compared\r\nwith the symphony, the diversity and elasticity of its thematic\r\ndevelopment (on three generative phrases) as well as the concrete\r\nbeauty of its substance make it one of the most distinguished examples\r\nof its class since that by César Franck.\r\n\r\n_Jour d'été à la montagne_, op. 61 (1905), three movements for\r\norchestra, with an underlying thematic unification of introduction\r\nand conclusion, after prose poems by Roger de Pampelonne, displays a\r\nbalance of greater homogeneity between constructive and descriptive\r\nelements than any of d'Indy's programmistic works. The use of\r\nplain-chant themes in the movement _Jour_,[54] with the subtitle\r\n_Après-midi sous les pins_, and again in _Soir_, manifests not only a\r\nfelicitous emotional connotation, but an increasing desire to correlate\r\neven the music of externals to spiritual sources.\r\n\r\nThe poem _Souvenirs_ for orchestra, op. 62 (1906), an elegy on the\r\ndeath of his wife, is not only profoundly elegiac in sentiment, but\r\nattains an unusual poignancy through the quotation of the theme of the\r\nBeloved from the earlier _Poème des Montagnes_. Both in _Jour d'été\r\nà la montagne_ and in _Souvenirs_ d'Indy employs orchestral effects\r\nranging from delicate subtlety to extreme force in a manner so entirely\r\nhis own as to dispel forever the question of imitative features.\r\n\r\nD'Indy's latest instrumental work, a piano sonata, op. 63 (1907), is\r\nmore happy in its formal constructive unity than in a euphonious or\r\nnatively idiomatic piano style. Its variations are hardly convincing\r\nmusic despite their technical skill; the scherzo has brilliant pages\r\nbut too much of its thematic material is indifferent. The finale\r\nsuffers for the same reason up to the climax and close, where the theme\r\nof the variations (first movement) and that of the finale are brought\r\ntogether with consummate contrapuntal perception.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, d'Indy as an instrumental composer has with sure and\r\nincreasing power fused the methods of Franck, with early contrapuntal\r\nelements, and his own individualistic sentiment into music which\r\npresents the strongest achievement in this direction since that of his\r\nmaster. If d'Indy is sometimes dry or over-complex, his best works show\r\na blending of the intellectual with the emotional which constitutes a\r\npersuasive bid for their durability. From a conservative standpoint\r\nit is impossible to imagine an abler unification of elements that\r\ntend to be disparate or antagonistic. As a master of the orchestra\r\nhe can still hold his own against ultra-modern developments although\r\nhe is relatively conservative in the forces he employs. If his piano\r\nmusic, including the _Helvetia Waltzes_ (1882), the _Schumanniana_\r\n(1887), the _Tableaux de Voyage_ (1889) and other pieces are, by\r\ncomparison with others of his works, insignificant, the cantata _Sainte\r\nMarie-Magdelène_ (1885), the chorus for women's voices _Sur la Mer_\r\n(1888), the imaginative song _Lied Maritime_ (1896) are conspicuous\r\ninstances in a somewhat neglected field.\r\n\r\nD'Indy's development as a dramatic composer follows a natural path\r\nof evolution. Despite the success of the 'Wallenstein Trilogy,' the\r\nlargeness of conception and the pregnant details of _Le Chant de la\r\nCloche_ op. 18 (1879-83), for solos, chorus and orchestra, text by\r\nthe composer after Schiller's poem, although preceded by the dramatic\r\nexperiments of _La Chevauchée du Cid_, op. 11 (1879), scene for\r\nbaritone, chorus and orchestra; _Clair de Lune_, op. 13 (1872-81),\r\ndramatic study for soprano and orchestra, and _Attendez-moi sous\r\nl'orme_, op. 14 (1882), opéra comique in one act, came as a complete\r\nsurprise. Even if d'Indy had obviously applied Wagner's dramatic\r\nprocedures, with modifications, to a choral work, the variety and power\r\nof expression, the firm treatment of the whole, and the superb use of a\r\nlarge orchestra astounded musicians and public alike. If the influence\r\nof both Franck and Wagner could be discerned in the scenes of 'Baptism'\r\nand 'Love,' the assertive personality evident in the scenes 'Vision'\r\nand 'Conflagration' was entirely original, and the dramatic strokes in\r\n'Death,' especially the telling use of portions of the Catholic service\r\nfor the dead in vigorous modal harmonization, bespoke a composer of\r\ntragic intensity of imagination.\r\n\r\nAnother surprise came several years later, in 1897, when _Fervaal_,\r\nop. 40 (1889-95), an opera in three acts, text by the composer, had\r\nits _première_ at the _Théâtre de la Monnaie_ in Brussels. For a\r\ntime the numerous and comprehensive Wagnerian obligations obscured\r\nthe real qualities of the work, and prevented a judicial opinion.\r\nResemblances were too many; a legendary subject, a hero who combined\r\ncharacteristics of Siegfried and Parsifal, a heroine partly compounded\r\nof Brünnhilde and Kundry, the renunciation of love as in the 'Ring'\r\nand many others. D'Indy furthermore boldly adopted the systematic use\r\nof leading-motives, and system of orchestration frankly modelled on\r\nWagner. But though _Fervaal_ was assimilative in underlying treatment,\r\nit was far less experimental than Chabrier's _Gwendoline_. It greatly\r\nsurpassed the older work not only in thorough absorption of technical\r\nmethod, in continuity and flexibility of style, but in appropriate\r\ndramatic characterization, and in adroit manipulation of the orchestral\r\nforces. Furthermore, in the essence of the subject dealing with the\r\npassing of Pagan mythology, with redemption through suffering, and the\r\noutcome a new religious faith whose key-note was the love of humanity,\r\nd'Indy achieved a dramatic elevation whose moral force indicated an\r\ninnovation in French operatic subjects. Its source was ultimately\r\nTeutonic, but its realization was concretely Gallic. Despite the\r\nmanifest obligations, _Fervaal_ not only shows a technical and dramatic\r\nskill of a high order, but a tragic note of distinctive individuality.\r\nThe symbolic use of the ancient hymn _Pange Lingua_ as typifying the\r\nChristian religion was not only a genuine dramatic inspiration but a\r\nsalient instance of effective connotation. With the revival in 1912 at\r\nthe Paris _Opéra_, when Wagnerianism was no longer an issue,[55] the\r\nintrinsic qualities of _Fervaal_ were appreciated more on their own\r\nmerits. The incidental music to Catulle Mendès' drama _Medée_, op. 47\r\n(1898), showed afresh d'Indy's ability in dramatic characterization, as\r\nwell as his faculty for realizing noble and tragic conceptions.\r\n\r\nWith the opera _L'Étranger_, op. 53 (1898-1901), d'Indy made a notable\r\nprogress in dramatic independence at the cost of unequal musical\r\ninvention. In the drama (text again by d'Indy) is to be found a\r\nconflict between the realistic and the symbolical which was confusing\r\nand prejudicial to the success of the opera. In addition the symbolism\r\nwas not always intelligible or convincing. If there were moral\r\nnobility in the drama in the personality of the unselfish Stranger\r\nwhose devotion to humanity was misunderstood or sneered at until he\r\ngave his life in an attempt to relieve ship-wrecked sailors, many of\r\nthe scenes were somewhat obscure in import. D'Indy also resorted to\r\nmusical symbolism in the use of a liturgic melody from the office of\r\nHoly Thursday, with the text _Ubi caritas et amor, ibi Deus est_ as a\r\nthematic basis for the entire work. While this induces an atmosphere\r\nof indubitable spiritual and moral elevation in the opera, there are\r\nmany scenes, especially in the first act, in which d'Indy's dramatic\r\nperceptions seem to have deserted him. At the end of the first act,\r\nand in the final scene more especially, d'Indy has written music\r\nof unparalleled dramatic intensity. In his orchestral style he has\r\nvirtually renounced Wagner, and its personal eloquence is exceedingly\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of d'Indy as a dramatic composer forms an epitome of\r\nthe development of French music along dramatic lines. First slightly\r\nirresolute, then acknowledging almost too sweepingly the glamour\r\nand originality of Wagner, a nationalistic sentiment has led to the\r\nrepudiation of his potent influence, and the gradual attainment of\r\ndramatic freedom. In a movement whose most characteristic works are\r\n_Gwendoline_, _Esclarmonde_, _Fervaal_, and _L'Étranger_ we are\r\ncompelled to pause at the moment of genuine transition, and defer\r\nthe completion of this list until later. Report has it that d'Indy\r\nhas finished the composition of another dramatic work, _La Légende\r\nde Saint-Christophe_ (1907-14), which should prove the strongest\r\ninstance of his unification of the dramatic and spiritual. D'Indy's\r\nart has tended more and more to concern itself with religious life and\r\nsentiment, and in his unselfish character he is peculiarly qualified to\r\ntreat such subjects.\r\n\r\nWith the consideration of d'Indy as an instrumental and dramatic\r\ncomposer, one has traversed the most significant of his works. In\r\naddition one must reiterate his services to the Société Nationale,\r\nthe years of laborious devotion at the Schola and his not infrequent\r\nappearances as conductor of programs of French music including a\r\nvisit to the United States in 1905. Besides, his work as editor and\r\nauthor completes roughly the sum total of his influence. With the\r\nreconstitutions of Monteverdi's _Orfeo_ and _L'Incoronazione di\r\nPoppea_, revisions of Rameau's _Dardanus_, _Hippolyte et Aricie_\r\nand _Zaïs_, and many other arrangements, the authorship (with the\r\ncollaboration of Auguste Sérieyx) of the _Cours de Composition_ in two\r\nvolumes (incomplete as yet) compiled from Schola lectures and showing\r\nan extraordinarily comprehensive erudition, the biographies of César\r\nFranck and Beethoven, not to mention a host of articles and addresses\r\nor lectures, one is able to sense the versatility and the solidity of\r\nd'Indy's achievements. It is easy to visualize the debt owed him by\r\nFrench music. In the first place he has steadily been a _conserver_\r\nfrom the technical standpoint. Using the sixteenth-century counterpoint\r\nas a point of departure, he has been innovative harmonically even\r\nto the point of prefiguring the whole-tone scale. Using with fluent\r\nadaptability the time-honored canon, fugue, passacaglia, chorale,\r\nvariation and sonata forms, he has been faithful fundamentally to\r\ntheir classic essence, while clothing them in a musical idiom which is\r\ndefinitely modern. While d'Indy is out of sympathy with atmospheric or\r\nfuturistic tendencies in the music of to-day, he is not of an invital\r\narch-conservative type. As a disciple of Franck he believes in the\r\n'liberty that comes from perfect obedience to the law,' though his\r\nspeech is permeated with individual eloquence. No more comprehensively\r\neminent figure exists in French music to-day. Others may have shown\r\nfresh paths, but they lack the totality of attainment which is\r\neminently characteristic of d'Indy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nAfter d'Indy, the other representative pupils of Franck have, with the\r\nexception of Guy Ropartz, had their careers cut short by premature\r\ndeath or illness. Nevertheless their accomplishment is far from being\r\nnegligible, and adds lustre not only to the fame of their master but a\r\nvery specific credit to French music.\r\n\r\nOf these the most gifted was Ernest Chausson, born at Paris in 1855,\r\nwho did not begin the serious study of music until after obtaining his\r\nbachelor's degree at law. Entering Massenet's composition class at\r\nthe Paris _Conservatoire_ in 1880, he tried for the prix de Rome in\r\nthe following year and failed. He accordingly left the conservatory\r\nand worked arduously with César Franck until 1883. Chausson was a man\r\nof considerable property, who could thus afford to compose. A man\r\nof cultivation and polish, a gracious host and an amiable comrade\r\nin society, he was in secret almost obsessed by melancholy, lack of\r\nself-confidence despite his affectionate, lovable and gentle nature.\r\nHe was retiring where his own interests were concerned, made no effort\r\nto push his works, and in consequence was not sought by managers.\r\nPossessing unusual discernment in literature and painting, he had a\r\nfine library, and a distinguished collection of paintings by Delacroix,\r\nDégas, Lerolle, Besnard and Carrière. Thus like Chabrier before him and\r\nDebussy after him, Chausson's sympathies were keen in more than one\r\nbranch of art. Chausson was eager to advance the cause of the Société\r\nNationale and labored as its secretary for nearly a dozen years. His\r\nmusic was played at its concerts and elsewhere, and began to make its\r\nway. Chausson was just entering a new creative phase with greater\r\nself-confidence, assertion and technical preparedness. At work on a\r\nstring quartet at his summer place Chimay, he went to refresh himself\r\none afternoon with a bicycle ride, and was found by the roadside, his\r\nhead crushed against a wall.\r\n\r\nChausson's music reflects his temperament with mirror-like\r\nresponsiveness. With perhaps more native gifts than d'Indy, he lacked\r\nthe latter's force of character and his passionate ambition for\r\nself-development. For long tormented by indecision as to whether to\r\nmake music his profession or not, his technical facility was uncertain,\r\nand not always equal to the tasks he imposed upon it. Like d'Indy he\r\nwas influenced both by Franck and Wagner. But he had a melodic vein\r\nthat was his own, a personal harmonic idiom, expressed in music of\r\npoetic and delicately-colored romanticism. Perhaps the most prominent\r\ntrait in his music is the indefinably affectionate sensibility of its\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nChausson began as a composer of chamber music and songs. He soon\r\nentered the orchestral field with a prelude 'The Death of Coelio,'\r\nthe symphonic poem _Viviane_, op. 5 (1882), and _Solitude dans les\r\nbois_ (1886), later destroyed. If _Viviane_ shows the insecure hand of\r\nthe apprentice, its technical insecurity is more than counterbalanced\r\nby the exquisite poetry and romance which breathe from its pages.\r\nChausson's orchestral masterpiece is his symphony in B-flat, op. 20\r\n(1890), whose conception is noble and dignified, whose themes are\r\nmature and full of sentiment, and which has many eloquent pages. Though\r\nthe work is deficient in rhythmic variety and flexibility of phrase,\r\nits underlying substance is too elevated to permit depreciation. Its\r\norchestral style, despite Wagnerian obligations, shows a distinguished\r\ncoloristic sense even in comparison with the unusual orchestral style\r\nof d'Indy. Despite certain defects, a _Concert_ for piano, violin\r\nand string quartet, op. 21 (1890-91), a _Poème_, op. 25 (1896), for\r\nviolin and orchestra, frequently played by Ysaye, a piano quartet, op.\r\n30 (1897), and the unfinished string quartet bespeak the talent and\r\npromise of achievement which was never to be fulfilled. In the dramatic\r\nfield, Chausson composed incidental music for performances at Bouchor's\r\nMarionette theatre of Shakespeare's _Tempest_, and Bouchor's _Legend of\r\nSt. Cecilia_, a lyric drama _Hélène_ (unpublished) and an opera, _Le\r\nRoi Arthus_ (text by himself), performed at Brussels in the _Théâtre de\r\nla Monnaie_ in 1903. That Chausson had dramatic instinct is especially\r\nevident in _Le Roi Arthus_, but there is immaturity in dramatic\r\ntechnique as well as a too lyrical treatment which detracts from the\r\nromantic atmosphere and imaginative conception of the whole. Among the\r\nsongs, 'The Caravan,' 'Poem of Love' and 'The Sea' and the well-nigh\r\nperfect _Chanson perpétuelle_ for voice and orchestra show Chausson's\r\nlyric gift at its best.\r\n\r\nChausson remains a figure of importance, even if much of his work\r\nsuggests the possibilities of the future rather than claims a final\r\njudgment on its own account. _Viviane_, the _Poème_ for violin, the\r\npiano quartet, the _Chanson perpétuelle_ and above all the Symphony\r\nwill survive their technical flaws on account of their individualistic\r\nexpression of noble thoughts and fastidiously poetic emotion.\r\n\r\nHenri Duparc, born at Paris in 1848, studied law as did d'Indy and\r\nChausson. One of the earliest pupils of César Franck, he was also one\r\nof the first Frenchmen to recognize Wagner, and made journeys with\r\nChabrier and d'Indy to hear his works in Germany. From 1869, Duparc\r\ncomposed piano pieces, songs, chamber music and works for orchestra.\r\nA merciless critic of his own music, he has destroyed several works,\r\nincluding a sonata for violoncello and piano, and two orchestral\r\nstudies. Since 1885 Duparc's career as a composer has been closed owing\r\nto persistent ill health. He is known by a symphonic poem _Lénore_\r\n(1875) after the ballad by Bürger, and something more than a dozen\r\nsongs. The symphonic poem is interesting if not remarkable, but the\r\nsongs reveal the born lyricist. Through thirty years of silence,\r\nthe vitality of some of these persists, especially _L'Invitation au\r\nvoyage_, _Ecstase_, _Lamento_, and _Phydilé_, as possessing distinctive\r\nqualities which place them in the front rank of French lyrics.\r\n\r\nGuillaume Lekeu (1870-94), another tragically unfulfilled artist of\r\nBelgian descent, played the violin at fourteen, studied the music of\r\nBach, Beethoven and Wagner by himself, and at the age of nineteen had\r\nan orchestral piece, _Le Chant de triomphale délivrance_, performed\r\nat Verviers, 'without having had a single lesson in composition.'[56]\r\nFrom 1888 he lived in Paris, where he obtained his bachelor's degree\r\nin philosophy. He became a friend of the poet Mallarmé, at whose\r\ngatherings of poets, painters and philosophers Claude Debussy\r\nfound such illuminating inspiration. Lekeu completed the study of\r\nharmony with Gaston Vallin, a pupil of Franck, and soon came under\r\nthe influence of Franck himself. After Franck's death, he continued\r\ncomposition lessons with d'Indy. D'Indy urged Lekeu, as a native\r\nBelgian, to compete for the Belgian _prix de Rome_. In 1891 he obtained\r\nthe second prize with a cantata _Andromède_. Its performance later\r\nwas so successful as to question the decision of the judges. In 1892\r\nLekeu wrote the sonata for piano and violin, which was frequently\r\nplayed by Ysaye. In the same year he finished a _Fantasie symphonique_\r\non two folk-tunes of Angers. While working at a piano quartet, Lekeu\r\ndied suddenly in 1894 from a relapse after typhoid fever. Despite the\r\ncontrary indications in his music, Lekeu was of a gay, outgoing nature,\r\nfull of spontaneity and exuberance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the works mentioned he left songs, a piano sonata, chamber\r\nmusic and orchestral pieces, among them symphonic studies on 'Hamlet'\r\nand 'Faust' (second part). It is perhaps inevitable that much of his\r\nmusic should be immature, but the sonata for piano and violin and the\r\npiano quartet show indisputable gifts of a very high order, in which\r\nmelodic inspiration, frank harmonic experiments (some of them more\r\nfelicitous than others), an original and thoughtful kind of beauty, and\r\nstrong delineation of tragic moods are the most salient qualities.\r\n\r\nAlexis de Castillon (1838-73) showed early aptitude for music, but was\r\neducated for the army in deference to the wishes of his family. After\r\nleaving the military school of Saint-Cyr, he became a cavalry officer.\r\nBut the impulse toward music was too strong and after several years he\r\nresigned from the army. He had studied music in a desultory fashion\r\nbefore, and now turned to Victor Massé (the composer of a popular\r\noperetta, _Les Noces de Jeannette_). From him he learned little or\r\nnothing. In 1868 Duparc introduced de Castillon to César Franck, who\r\ngladly received him as a pupil. De Castillon served valiantly during\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war and then returned to his chosen profession\r\nonly to die two years later, leaving piano pieces, songs, some half\r\na dozen chamber works including the piano and violin sonata op. 6, a\r\nconcerto for piano, orchestral pieces, and a setting of the 84th Psalm.\r\nBy reason of the vicissitudes of his life, de Castillon was never able\r\nto do justice to his gifts. The sonata, a string quartet, and a piano\r\nquartet, op. 7, show a native predisposition for chamber music, which\r\nassuredly would have ripened had the composer's life been spared.\r\nAt his funeral were assembled Bizet, Franck, Lalo, Duparc, d'Indy,\r\nMassenet, Saint-Saëns, and others who had 'loved the artist and the\r\nman.'[57] Impressed by this assemblage one of de Castillon's relatives\r\nremarked: 'Then he really had talent!'[58]\r\n\r\nCharles Bordes (1865-1905) should receive some mention, not only\r\nfor his piano pieces, songs, sacred music, and orchestral works,\r\nbut for innumerable transcriptions and arrangements of folk-songs,\r\ncantatas, vocal pieces by various French composers, and his anthology\r\nof religious music of the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries.\r\nFurthermore his organization of the _Chanteurs de Saint Gervais_ gave a\r\ndecided impulse toward the revival of sacred music, and his labors at\r\nthe _Schola_ in Paris and the branch established at Montpellier give\r\nevidence of his untiring devotion to the cause of art.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the pathetic incompleteness of the careers of Chausson,\r\nLekeu, de Castillon, and Bordes, Guy Ropartz has been enabled by reason\r\nof his long activity to round out his talent. Joseph-Guy-Marie Ropartz\r\nwas born at Guincamp in the north of France in 1864. After completing\r\nhis general education he graduated from the law school at Rennes and\r\nwas admitted to the bar. Then, like d'Indy and Chausson, he gave up law\r\nfor music, entered the Paris _Conservatoire_, where he studied with\r\nDubois and Massenet. In 1887 he left the _Conservatoire_ to be a pupil\r\nof Franck. In 1894 he became director of the conservatory at Nancy, a\r\nposition which he still holds.\r\n\r\nRopartz has been an industrious composer, and among his works are\r\nincidental music for four dramas, including Pierre Loti's and Louis\r\nTiercelius' drama _Pêcheur d'Islande_; a music drama, _Le Pays_;\r\nfour symphonies; a fantasia; a symphonic study, _La Chasse du Prince\r\nArthur_; several suites for orchestra; two string quartets; a sonata\r\nfor violoncello and piano, and one for violin and piano; many songs and\r\nvocal pieces including a setting of the 137th Psalm.\r\n\r\nFollowing the principles of Franck, he tends toward cyclical forms\r\non generative themes, and in addition employs Breton folk-songs\r\nin orchestral and dramatic works. The symphony in C major, by its\r\ntreatment of a generative phrase, emphasizes his fidelity to his\r\nmaster, but despite effective and transparent orchestration the work is\r\nlacking in strong individuality and in inherent logic and continuity\r\nin development. The sonatas for violin and for violoncello with piano\r\ndisplay adequate workmanship and conception of style but do not possess\r\nconcrete musical persuasiveness. Ropartz appears in the most favorable\r\nlight when his music gives free utterance to nationalistic sentiment\r\nand 'local color.' His Breton suite and the Fantasia have a rustic\r\npiquancy and rhythmic verve which give evidence of sincere conviction.\r\n\r\n_Le Pays_ is said by no less an authority than Professor Henri\r\nLichtenberger to belong to 'the little group of works which, like\r\n_Pelléas et Mélisande_ of Debussy, _Ariane et Barbe-bleue_ of Dukas,\r\n_Le Cœur du Moulin_ of Déodat de Séverac, _L'Heure espagnole_ of\r\nRavel, have distinct value and significance in the evolution of our\r\nFrench art.'[59] But a study of the music does not entirely bear\r\nthis out. Ropartz shows in this music drama an obvious gift for the\r\nstage, and his music clearly heightens the dramatic situations. In its\r\nfreedom from outside influence it undoubtedly possesses historical\r\nsignificance, but in compelling originality it does not maintain the\r\nlevel of the works mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing pupils of Franck are those who have best illustrated the\r\ndidactic standpoint of their revered master, both as regards technical\r\ntreatment and uncompromising self-expression. Of these d'Indy is\r\nincomparably the most distinguished by virtue of the continuity of his\r\ndevelopment, the intrinsic message of his music, and his remarkable\r\nfaculty for organization in educative propaganda. If Chausson,\r\nLekeu, and Bordes were prevented from reaping the just rewards to\r\nwhich their gifts entitled them, they attained not only enough for\r\nself-justification but have left a definite imprint on the course of\r\nmodern French music.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though Franck's pupils are not iconoclastic, though\r\nthey seem ultra-reactionary in some respects, their united efforts\r\nhave preserved intact the traditions of one of the noblest figures in\r\nFrench music, and in their works is to be found music of such lofty\r\nconception, admirable technical execution, and fearless expression of\r\npersonality as to make the task of disparagement futile and ungrateful.\r\nMoreover, this influence has not ceased with the actual pupils of\r\nFranck. The names and works of Magnard,[60] Roussel, de Séverac and\r\nSamazeuilh attest the fact that the Franckian tradition is still a\r\nliving force.\r\n\r\nWhile Emmanuel Chabrier and Gabriel Fauré showed the way for new\r\nvitality in musical expression and the pupils of Franck demonstrated\r\nthat the resources of conservatism were not yet exhausted, new\r\nmovements were also on foot which may be classified as belonging to\r\nthe 'impressionistic or atmospheric' school. A consideration of this\r\nmovement, together with some unclassifiable figures and an indication\r\nof the work of some younger men, will follow in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n                                                         E.

Within a year or two\r\nafter the death of César Franck and Edouard Lalo, while Saint-Saëns was\r\nin the full tide of his ceaseless productivity, while Massenet, then\r\nfamed as the composer of _Manon_, was shortly to meditate his _Thaïs_\r\nand _La Navarraise_, while the irrepressible Chabrier was beginning\r\nto pay the toll of his strenuous activity, while Fauré's songs had\r\nalready won recognition for their subtle mixtures of sensuousness and\r\nmysticism, while d'Indy and Chausson were evolving their individuality\r\non the lines laid down by their revered master, there arose strikingly\r\nnew principles of musical expression, involving a new æsthetic\r\nstandpoint, an enlargement of harmonic resource, supplying a new and\r\nvital idiom which is perhaps the most characteristically Gallic of\r\nthe ultra-modern movements centred in Paris. These principles have\r\ncrystallized into the impressionistic or 'atmospheric' school, whose\r\nrise during the past fifteen or twenty years has been little short of\r\nmeteoric.\r\n\r\nThe subject of parallelism between the arts with a definite interacting\r\ninfluence is a fertile one for discussion. While but little space can\r\nbe devoted here to enlargement upon this topic, it may be observed\r\nthat with the advance of culture the intervening time before one art\r\nreacts upon another becomes shorter. If the Renaissance was relatively\r\nslow in affecting music, the revolutionary outbreaks of 1830 and\r\n1848 were more nearly synchronous, while in the case of realism and\r\nimpressionism, the resulting confluence of principles was nearly\r\nsimultaneous. Fortunately the basic methods of impressionism in\r\npainting and poetry are so well understood that no definition of their\r\npurposes is needful beyond a reminder that they aim to subordinate\r\ndetail in favor of the effect as a whole. In music impressionism is\r\nobtained by procedures analogous if markedly dissimilar from those\r\nemployed in painting. The results are alike in that both arts have\r\ngained enormously in scope of subject as well as in greater brilliancy,\r\nelusive poetry and human significance in their treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that Claude Debussy may be considered as the\r\nreal originator of impressionism in music, although he did not begin\r\nto compose in this manner. But Debussy's success has brought forth\r\na host of imitators in France, Russia, England, and even the United\r\nStates, while so essentially Teutonic a composer as Max Reger has\r\npassed through a Debussian phase. Another composer who has contributed\r\nto the development of impressionistic method is Maurice Ravel, and\r\nhe undoubtedly has derived much from Debussy. At the same time he\r\ndisplays many original characteristics which have nothing in common\r\nwith Debussy, and hence he cannot be dismissed as a mere echo of the\r\nolder composer. Impressionism has become so essentially a part of\r\nultra-modern French musical evolution as to merit a clear exposition of\r\nits claims and the achievements of its founders.\r\n\r\nClaude-Achille Debussy was born at St. Germain-en-Laye, not far from\r\nParis, August 22, 1862. His father was ambitious to make a sailor of\r\nhis son, but a certain Mme. Mautet, whose son was a brother-in-law\r\nof Paul Verlaine, herself a pupil of Chopin, was so impressed by the\r\nboy's piano playing that she prepared him for entrance into the Paris\r\nConservatory. He obtained medals in solfeggio and piano playing, but\r\nwas less fortunate in the harmony class. In the class of Émile Durand\r\nthe study of harmony resolved itself into an effort to discover the\r\n'author's harmony' for a given bass or soprano, hampered by rules\r\n'as arbitrary as those of bridge.'[61] Debussy also entered Franck's\r\norgan class at the Conservatory, but here also he was at odds with\r\nthe master, whose urgings 'modulate, modulate!' during the pupil's\r\nimprovizations seemed too often without point. In 1879 Debussy\r\njourneyed to Russia with Mme. Metch, the wife of a Russian railway\r\nconstructor, in the capacity of domestic pianist. He made slight\r\nacquaintance with Balakireff, Borodine, and Rimsky-Korsakoff, but never\r\ncame across Moussorgsky, who was destined later to exercise so marked\r\nan influence upon his dramatic methods. The dominant expression which\r\nhe brought back from Russia was that of the fantastic gypsy music,\r\nwhose rhapsodic and improvisatory character addressed itself readily\r\nto his fancy. At last Debussy entered the composition class of Ernest\r\nGuiraud, and here his ability quickly asserted itself. After a mention\r\nin counterpoint and fugue in 1882, he obtained a second _prix de Rome_\r\nin 1885, and the first prize in the year following with the cantata\r\n'The Prodigal Son,' entitling him to study in Rome at governmental\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome Debussy sent back to the Institute, as required, a portion\r\nof a setting of Heine's lyrical drama _Almanzor_, a suite for women's\r\nvoices and orchestra, 'Spring,' recently published in a revision\r\nfor orchestra alone; a setting of Rossetti's 'The Blessed Damozel'\r\nfor voices and orchestra (finished after his return to Paris), and\r\na fantasy for piano and orchestra which has never been published or\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris Debussy made the acquaintance of Moussorgsky's\r\n_Boris Godounoff_ in the first edition, before the revisions and\r\nalterations made by Rimsky-Korsakoff. This work was an immense\r\nrevelation of the possibilities of a simple yet poignant dramatic\r\nstyle, and undoubtedly was fraught with suggestion to the future\r\ncomposer of _Pelléas_. A visit to Bayreuth in 1889, where he heard\r\n_Tristan_, _Parsifal_, and the _Meistersinger_, showed Wagner in a\r\nnew light to Debussy. But on repeating the trip in the following year\r\nhe returned disillusionized and henceforth Wagner ceased to exert any\r\ninfluence whatever upon him. For some time at this period Debussy was\r\ngenerously aided by the publisher Georges Hartmann, who had likewise\r\nencouraged de Castillon and Massenet. During these years Debussy\r\ncomposed many piano pieces and songs, among them the _Arabesques_\r\n(1888), the _Ballade_, _Danse_, _Mazurka_, _Reverie_, _Nocturne_, and\r\nthe _Suite Bergamasque_, all dating from 1890. These piano pieces\r\nexhibit Debussy as a frankly melodic composer of indubitable refinement\r\nand imagination, in a vein not far removed from that of Massenet,\r\nalthough possessing more distinction and poetic sentiment. Among the\r\nsongs the early _Nuit d'étoiles_ (1876), _Fleur des blés_ (1878), and\r\n_Beau Soir_ (1878) are experimental, the last of the three being the\r\nmost interesting. The 'Three Melodies' (1880), containing the songs\r\n_La Belle au bois dormant_, _Voici que le Printemps_, and _Paysage\r\nsentimental_, the _Ariettes oubliées_ (1888, but revised later) show a\r\nmarked progress in concreteness of mood and harmonic subtlety. Three\r\nsongs (1890) on texts by Verlaine, _L'Échelonnement des haies_, _La Mer\r\nest plus belle_, and _Le Son du Cor s'afflige_, and the _Cinq poëmes\r\nde Baudelaire_ (1890), show a further evolution of lyric delineation.\r\nIf the latter are unequal (_Le Balcon_ and _Le jet d'eau_ are the\r\nmost vital) they at least demonstrate an æsthetic ferment toward the\r\nlater Debussy. _Mandoline_ (also 1890) is also a direct premonition\r\nof a maturer style. In confirmation of this steady evolution one must\r\nrecall that side by side with the palpable influence of Massenet in\r\nthe cantata 'The Prodigal Son' (especially in the prelude) and in the\r\nsecond movement of the suite 'Spring' there were likewise harmonic\r\nindividualities and expressive sentiments in the first movement of the\r\nsuite, and in the delicately pre-Raphaelitic 'Blessed Damozel' which\r\npresage the developments to come.\r\n\r\nHowever, the direct stimulus which guided Debussy in his search for\r\npersonal enfranchisement did not come from musical sources,[62] but\r\nfrom association with poets, literary critics, and painters. From 1885\r\nonwards,[63] the symbolist poets Gustave Kahn, Pierre Louys, Francis\r\nVielé-Griffin, Stuart Merrill, Paul Verlaine, Henri de Regnier, the\r\npainter Whistler, and many others were in the habit of meeting at the\r\nhouse of Stéphane Mallarmé, the symbolist poet, for discussion on a\r\nvariety of æsthetic topics. The _Salon de la Rose-Croix_, formed by\r\nFrench painters as an outcome of pre-Raphaelite influence, grew out\r\nof these meetings. Verlaine and Mallarmé had founded the 'Wagnerian\r\nReview' as a medium for exposition of the essential unity of all the\r\narts. As a result of these critical inquiries and debates, Debussy was\r\nstruck with the possibility of attempting to transfer impressionistic\r\nand symbolistic theories into the domain of music.\r\n\r\nThe first concrete instance of a deliberate embodiment of\r\nimpressionistic method is to be found in the exquisite 'Prelude to the\r\nAfternoon of a Faun' (1882), founded on the poem by Mallarmé. Here\r\nDebussy succeeded admirably in translating the vague symbolism of the\r\npoem into music of languorous mood and ineffably delicate poetry. This\r\nbrief piece, novel and striking in both harmonic and expressive idiom,\r\nmarks a departure into a field of fertile consequence and far-reaching\r\nimport both intrinsically and historically.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1892, also, that Debussy quite by chance came\r\nacross Maeterlinck's play _Pelléas et Mélisande_. Both the intensely\r\nhuman elements in the drama and its sensitive symbolism made a strong\r\nappeal to Debussy's newly awakened æsthetic instincts and, after\r\nobtaining permission to utilize the play as an opera text, he at once\r\nset to work upon it. For ten years Debussy labored upon _Pelléas_ with\r\na patient striving to realize in music its humanitarian sentiment,\r\nits creative poetry and its tragedy. During these years of gradual\r\ndistillation of thought he attained slowly but surely the inimitable\r\nstyle of his maturity. But in the meantime he composed also in various\r\nother fields.\r\n\r\nAlready the songs, _Fêtes galantes_ (1892), on Verlaine's poems showed\r\nin their delicately impressionistic introspection that the 'Afternoon\r\nof a Faun' was no casual experiment. Similarly, the _Proses Lyriques_\r\n(1893), although unequal, exhibit clearly, especially in the songs _De\r\nRêve_ and _De Grève_, a formulation of the whole-tone idiom, which was\r\nlater to become a characteristic feature of Debussy's style. A string\r\nquartet (also 1893) was, by virtue of its inevitable restriction, a\r\nmomentary abandonment of the impressionistic ideal, but within these\r\nlimitations Debussy achieved an astonishing individuality, charm\r\nof mood, and clearcut workmanship, particularly in the thoughtful,\r\nslow movement and the piquant scherzo. In 1898 he returned to the\r\nimpressionistic vein with three _Chansons de Bilitis_ from the\r\nlike-named volume of poems by Pierre Louys. The naïveté, humor, and\r\npenetrating poetry of these lyrics were akin to the imaginative vein\r\nof the _Fêtes galantes_.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Debussy gave a larger affirmation of his\r\nimpressionistic creed with the Nocturnes for orchestra entitled\r\n'Clouds,' 'Festivals,' and 'Sirens' (the latter with a chorus of\r\nwomen's voices). These pieces, although avowedly programmistic,\r\ndo not attempt realistic tone-painting, but aim rather to suggest\r\nimpressionistic moods growing out of their titles. The slow procession\r\nof clouds, the dazzling intermingling of groups of revellers, the\r\nelusive seduction of imaginary sirens are pictured with an atmospheric\r\nverity that far transcends the possibilities of realistic standpoint.\r\nMusically the Nocturnes are distinguished by their intrinsic potency\r\nof expression, their basic formal coherence and logic of development,\r\ntheir concreteness of mood, and their picturesqueness of detail. The\r\nuse of a chorus of women's voices, vocalizing without text, a feature\r\nalready employed in 'Spring,' was not original to Debussy, for Berlioz\r\nhad already employed it in his highly dramatic but little known Funeral\r\nMarch for the last scene of 'Hamlet' (1848). But Debussy's highly\r\ncoloristic and ingenious application of the medium greatly enhances the\r\npervasive poetry of this Nocturne, and transforms it into a virtual\r\nnovelty. Not the least interesting harmonic consideration of this piece\r\nis the use, with some definite system, of the whole-tone scale, which\r\nDebussy later exploited so remarkably, and of which up to this time\r\nonly transient suggestions had appeared.\r\n\r\nDuring his long contemplative absorption in _Pelléas_ Debussy had not\r\nentirely neglected composition for the piano. A _Marche écossaise_\r\n'on a popular theme' ('The Earl of Ross's March') for four hands\r\n(1891, orchestrated in 1908) is piquant and vivacious without being\r\nparticularly characteristic. A 'Little Suite' for the same combination\r\n(1894), if somewhat slight musically, is pleasing for its clarity\r\nand simple directness. In 1901, however, Debussy showed a far more\r\ndefinite originality, both pianistically and harmonically, in a set of\r\nthree pieces entitled _Pour le Piano_, with the subtitles 'Prelude,'\r\n'Sarabande' and 'Toccata.' If the prelude suggests something of the\r\nstyle of Bach, if the Sarabande is to a certain extent a modernization\r\nof the gravity of Rameau, and the toccata bears a resemblance in its\r\nfiery impulsiveness to Domenico Scarlatti, these pieces are none the\r\nless positively characteristic of Debussy in their fundamentals. The\r\nfrank use of the whole-tone scale in the prelude, the harmonic boldness\r\nof the sarabande with its sequences of sevenths, and the ingenious\r\npiano figures in the toccata are the external evidences of a basically\r\nindividual conception. If these pieces do not display the impressionism\r\nthat is indigenous to the later Debussy, they represent a transition\r\nstage of far from negligible interest.\r\n\r\nWith the performances in 1902 of _Pelléas et Mélisande_ at the Opéra\r\nComique Debussy attained an immediate and definite renown. There was\r\nabundance of opposition, disparagement, and ill-natured criticism,\r\nbut the work was too obviously significant to be downed by it. To\r\nbegin with it was epoch-making in the annals of French dramatic art\r\nin that it marked a complete enfranchisement from the influence of\r\nWagner. Debussy had been censured for saying that melody in the voice\r\nparts (that is, _formal_ melody) was 'anti-dramatic,' but his by no\r\nmeans unmelodic recitative with its fastidious attention to finesse\r\nof declamation justified the restriction of the melodic element to\r\nthe orchestra. If the dramatic style of _Pelléas_, in its economy of\r\nmusical emphasis, was directly modelled upon Moussorgsky's _Boris_,\r\nthe evolution of this idea in which the orchestra throughout, with\r\nthe exception of a few climaxes, maintained a transparent delicacy\r\nof sonority, established a new conception of dramatic style as well\r\nas new resources in sensibility of timbre. Harmonically, _Pelléas_\r\nshows both a surprising unity (considering that it occupied Debussy\r\nfor ten years at a transitional phase of his career) and a remarkable\r\nextension of devices scarcely more than hinted at in his earlier\r\nworks. It is difficult to formulate these innovations briefly, but\r\nthey may be grouped under three general headings. First, an æsthetic\r\nabrogation of certain conventional harmonic procedures; the free use\r\nof consecutive fifths and octaves, sequences of seventh chords (in\r\nwhich Fauré definitely anticipated Debussy), and of ninths. In these\r\nseemingly anarchistic over-rulings of tradition Debussy was guided by\r\na sure and hyper-sensitive instinct. Second, the employment of modal\r\nharmonization, sometimes strict but more often free, with a singularly\r\nfelicitous dramatic connotation. Third, the development of a logical\r\nmanner founded on the whole-tone scale. Debussy cannot claim that he\r\noriginated the whole-tone scale, since it was used by Dargomijsky in\r\nthe third act of 'The Stone Guest' (1869), by various neo-Russians,\r\nnotably Rimsky-Korsakoff, by Chabrier, Fauré, and d'Indy (in the second\r\nact of _Fervaal_); nevertheless he can be said to have made this\r\nidiom his own by his flexible and discriminating manipulation of its\r\nresources. Debussy does not employ the whole-tone scale as monotonously\r\nas is often supposed. On the contrary, one of the marked features of\r\nhis harmonic style is its resourceful variety.\r\n\r\nDebussy's use of motives constitutes the very antipodes of Wagner's\r\nsomewhat cumbrous symphonic development of them. If at first Debussy's\r\ntreatment seems too fluid and lacking in continuity, a closer study\r\nof the score (especially in the orchestral version) will reveal not\r\nonly a flexible adaptation of motives to the dramatic situations,\r\nbut a logical and constructive development often with considerable\r\ncontrapuntal dexterity. Furthermore, a formal coherence is maintained\r\nwithout the artifices of symphonic development.\r\n\r\nBut the import of _Pelléas_ does not consist merely in the historical\r\nor technical value of its innovating features, although this is patent.\r\nIt resides primarily in the basic poignancy with which the music\r\nillustrates and reinforces the touching drama by Maeterlinck, as well\r\nas its intrinsic surpassing beauty and poetic thrall. It is because\r\nDebussy has characterized the innocent, gentle Mélisande, the ardent\r\nPelléas, Golaud haggard with jealousy, the childlike carelessness of\r\nYniold during a questioning of such import to his father, with such\r\nsearching fidelity to the creations of the poet that we find music and\r\ndrama in accord to an extent seldom witnessed in the history of opera.\r\nIt is because Debussy has brought such freshness of musical invention\r\nand profound aptness of interpretation in such scenes as the discovery\r\nof Mélisande by Golaud, the questioning end of Act I, the animated\r\nscene between Pelléas and Mélisande in Act II, their long love scene in\r\nAct III, the dramatic duet at the end of Act IV, and the death scene\r\nof Mélisande in Act V, that this opera occupies a unique position.\r\nThe characterization of the forest, of the subterranean vaults of the\r\nchâteau, of the remorse of Golaud after his deed of vengeance, and the\r\npurifying majesty of death show Debussy as a poet and dramatist of\r\nindisputable mastery. Indeed, it is not too much to say that _Pelléas\r\net Mélisande_ occupies a position in modern French music akin to that\r\nof _Tristan und Isolde_ in German dramatic literature.\r\n\r\nAfter _Pelléas_, Debussy turned again to the impressionistic style\r\nin piano pieces and orchestral works of progressive evolution. With\r\nthe 'Engravings' for piano (1903) containing 'Pagodas,' 'Evening in\r\nGrenada,' 'Gardens in the Rain,' he continued the impressionistic\r\nmethod of 'The Afternoon of a Faun' with an amplified harmonic and\r\nexpressive idiom. 'Pagodas,' founded on the Cambodian scale, and\r\nthe Spanish suggestions in 'Evening in Grenada' are characteristic\r\ninstances of the French taste for exoticism; 'Gardens in the Rain'\r\nis founded upon an old French folk-song which Debussy used later in\r\nthe orchestral _Image, Rondes de Printemps_. All three are markedly\r\nindividual, and display the poetic insight of Debussy tempered by\r\ndiscretion. 'Masks' and 'The Joyous Isle' (both 1904) contain alike\r\nfantastic exuberance and an increasingly personal pianistic and\r\nharmonic style. The latter in particular contains a homogeneity of\r\nthematic development supposedly incompatible with an impressionistic\r\nmethod. Two sets of _Images_ (1905 and 1907) make still greater\r\ndemands upon the impressionistic capacity of the listener, sometimes\r\nat the expense of concrete musical inventiveness, but those entitled\r\n'Reflections in the Water' and 'Goldfishes' offer no diminution of\r\nimaginative vitality. 'The Children's Corner' (1908), a collection\r\nof miniatures, are sketches of poetic appeal, though relatively\r\nslight. The final number, 'Golliwog's Cakewalk,' is a fascinating\r\nFrench version of ragtime style. Mr. André Caplet has orchestrated\r\nthese pieces with sensitive taste. Two series of 'Preludes' (1911 and\r\n1913) exhibit both the virtues and defects of Debussy's piano music.\r\nIn some the piano is scarcely equal to the impressionistic demands\r\nmade upon it, others touch the high-water mark of Debussy's versatile\r\ninvention. In the first set, 'Veils,' 'The Wind in the Plain,' 'The\r\nEnveloped Cathedral' are felicitously impressionistic; the 'Sounds and\r\nPerfumes Turn in the Evening Air,' 'The Girl with Flaxen Hair' are\r\nlyrically atmospheric, while in 'Minstrels' is to be found another\r\ninimitably humorous transcription of ragtime idiom. In the second set,\r\n_La Puerta del Vino_ is an imaginatively exotic Habañera; _La terrasse\r\ndes audiences des clair de lune_ is of rarefied emotional atmosphere;\r\n'The Fairies are Exquisite Dancers' and _Ondine_ are brilliant bits\r\nof delicate fancy; 'General Lavine--Eccentric' is another witty\r\nadaptation of rag-time in the Debussian manner. 'Fireworks,' a\r\nbrilliantly impressionistic study ending with a distant refrain of\r\nthe _Marseillaise_ in a key other than that of the bass, approaches\r\nrealism, a final climax, before the above-mentioned refrain, consisting\r\nof a double glissando on the black and white keys simultaneously.\r\n'Fireworks' is also notable for a cadenza which is not in Debussy's\r\nharmonic style, and which closely resembles cadenzas characteristic of\r\nMaurice Ravel. But, with the historic precedent of Haydn in his old\r\nage learning of Mozart in orchestral procedure, one must not deny the\r\nsame privilege to Debussy. This detail is not without its piquant side,\r\nbecause Ravel has been unjustly reproached for too many 'obligations'\r\nto Debussy.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Debussy has published several sets of songs entitled\r\nto mention. A second collection of _Fêtes galantes_ (1904) shows a\r\nslight falling off in spontaneity, but _Le Faune_ is imaginative and\r\nfelicitously inventive, and in the _Colloque sentimental_ an ingenious\r\nquotation is made from an accompaniment figure of _En Sourdine_ in the\r\nfirst collection, justifiable not only on account of the sentiments\r\nof the text in the second song, but for the reminiscent alteration\r\nof the original harmonies. A charming song, _Le Jardin_ (presumably\r\n1905), from a collection of settings by various French composers of\r\npoems by Paul Gravollet, having a delightful running accompaniment\r\nover a measured declamation of the text, must be regarded as one of\r\nDebussy's best. With some departure from his usual choice of texts,\r\nDebussy has successfully set three _Ballades_ (1910) by François\r\nVillon, reproducing with uncommon picturesqueness the archaic flavor of\r\nthe poem. The same year witnessed the publication of _Le Promenoir des\r\namants_ on poems by Tristan Lhermitte, whose delicate poetic style is\r\nmore characteristic of his established individuality. Of the 'Three\r\nPoems by Mallarmé' (1913) one must admit an exquisite but somewhat\r\ntenuous musical sentiment, not entirely free from the 'polyharmonic'\r\ninfluence now current in Paris.\r\n\r\nAmong Debussy's vocal works, especial stress should be laid on the\r\nspontaneous and spirited settings for unaccompanied mixed chorus of the\r\n_Trois Chansons_ of Charles d'Orléans (1908). Here Debussy has caught\r\nthe spirit of these fifteenth-century poems most aptly, and yet has\r\nnot departed essentially from his own individuality. It is incredible\r\nthat these choruses are not better known, and that they are not in the\r\nrepertory of more choral societies.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is not to be supposed that Debussy had relinquished\r\norchestral composition since his success with _Pelléas et Mélisande_.\r\nIn 1904 he wrote two dances, _Danse profane_ and _Danse sacrée_,\r\nfor the newly invented chromatic harp with accompaniment of string\r\norchestra. These pieces are pleasingly archaic in character and yet\r\nnot unduly so, illustrating an unusual capacity in Debussy's inventive\r\nimagination. 'The Sea,' three symphonic sketches for orchestra\r\n(1903-1905), produced in 1905, cannot be considered entirely successful\r\nin spite of many remarkable qualities. Here Debussy has attempted a\r\nsubject which has proved disillusionizing for many composers, and\r\none which is perhaps beyond the scope of his imagination. There are\r\npicturesque and beautiful episodes in the first movement, particularly\r\nthe last pages, but the effect of the movement as a whole is\r\ndisjointed. The second movement, _Jeux des Vagues_, is thoroughly\r\ncharming in its fanciful delineation of its title, and possesses\r\nmore continuity of development. The third movement, again, is less\r\nsatisfactory, although the climax is stirringly triumphant. In 1909\r\nDebussy published three _Images_ for orchestra: _Gigues_ (not published\r\nuntil 1913, although announced with the others), _Ibéria_, and _Rondes\r\nde Printemps_. _Gigues_ is a slight if charming piece, with vivacious\r\nrhythms and no little originality of orchestral effect; _Rondes de\r\nPrintemps_ is a fantastic and sensitive impressionistic sketch, founded\r\nupon the same folk-song which Debussy employed in 'Gardens in the Rain'\r\nfrom the 'Engravings,' here treated with the contrapuntal resources of\r\nimitation and augmentation. If an episode in the middle of the piece is\r\nless vital both in invention and treatment, the effect of the whole is\r\nfull of poetry, especially at the climax where the strings divided have\r\na sequence of inverted chords of the eleventh descending diatonically\r\nwith magical effect. But the most significant by far of these _Images_\r\nis _Ibéria_ (the ancient name for Spain), in which Debussy has given\r\nfree play to his exotic imagination and his faculty for impressionistic\r\ntreatment. Like Chabrier's _España_, Debussy's _Ibéria_ is still Spain\r\nseen through a Frenchman's eyes, but with an enormous temperamental\r\ndifference in vision. In the first section, 'Through the Streets and\r\nByways,' Debussy has never shown more fantastic brilliance and vivid,\r\nalmost garish, interplay of color. In the second portion, 'The Perfumes\r\nof Night,' he has never exceeded its poignant atmosphere of surcharged\r\nsensibility. A theme for divided violas and violoncellos recalls the\r\nemotional heights of _Pelléas_. The last movement, 'Morning on a Fête\r\nDay,' shows an impressionism intensified almost to realism. As a whole\r\n_Ibéria_ is perhaps the most satisfying example of Debussy's mature\r\nmethod, in which we find an undiminished vitality of imagination\r\ncombined with irreproachable workmanship. Debussy's orchestral style,\r\nwhile difficult to adjust satisfactorily, is full of delicate and\r\nbrilliant coloristic effects side by side.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 Debussy wrote incidental music for Gabriel d'Annunzio's drama\r\n'The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian.' It is a thankless task to appraise\r\ndramatic music apart from its intended adjuncts, especially when it\r\nis somewhat fragmentary in character. There is an abundant use of\r\nthe quasi-archaic idiom (already employed in the first of the Dances\r\nfor harp and strings), which found its justification in the mystical\r\ncharacter of the drama. Also there seems a little straining of\r\nimpressionistic resources in harmony, and not a little effective choral\r\nwriting. An orchestra of unusual constituence gave opportunity for\r\neffects of a striking character. But the fact remains that the music\r\nloses much of its appeal apart from the conditions for which it was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nOf late Debussy has taken to the ballet, influenced no doubt by the\r\nexample of his contemporaries and the magnificent opportunities for\r\nperformance offered by the annual visits of Diaghilev's Russian Ballet.\r\nFlorent Schmitt was one of the first of ultra-modern Frenchmen to try\r\nthis form with his lurid and masterly _Tragédie de Salomé_ (1907); then\r\nfollowed Paul Dukas with _La Péri_ (1910), Maurice Ravel with 'Daphnis\r\nand Chloë' (1911), and other works to be mentioned later.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Debussy published _Jeux_, ballet in one act on a scenario by\r\nNijinsky, and _Khamma_, of the same dimensions, by W. L. Courtney\r\nand Maud Allan. Finally, in 1913, he composed the miniature\r\nballet-pantomime _La Boîte aux joujoux_, by André Heller. In these\r\nworks he has shown a natural theatrical and scenic instinct which is\r\nextraordinary, a sensitive adaptation of music to dramatic situations,\r\nand a surprising versatility in spite of his previous vindications\r\nof this quality. The plot of _Jeux_ is slight and fantastically\r\nunreal and improbable, but it has afforded a basis for impalpable\r\nmusic of great subtlety and distinction, in which the appeal to\r\nDebussy's imagination was obvious. _Khamma_, admirably contrived from\r\nthe dramatic point of view for the logical introduction of dancing,\r\nexhibits a breadth of conception and a heroic quality which is rare in\r\nDebussy. Unfortunately, incidents have prevented this ballet from being\r\nperformed (as far as may be ascertained), but this assuredly has not\r\nbeen on account of the inadequacy of the music. _La Boîte aux joujoux_\r\ndiffers totally from the two preceding in being, as its title-page\r\nasserts, a ballet for children. It is not an unalloyed surprise from\r\nthe pen of the composer of the 'Children's Corner,' but it combines\r\ngenuine poetry, humor, mock-realism, and a judicious miniature medium\r\nthat is entirely original. If musically at least _La Boîte aux joujoux_\r\npresupposes a very sophisticated child, that does not prevent it from\r\nmaking an instant appeal to mature listeners.\r\n\r\nFor many years it has been announced that Debussy has been at work on\r\noperas taken from Poe's stories 'The Devil in the Belfry' and 'The Fall\r\nof the House of Usher.' There have also been rumors that he was at\r\nwork on a version of the story of Tristan. It is a foregone conclusion\r\nthat these works will not appear until their scrupulous composer is\r\nsatisfied with every detail.\r\n\r\nLike other modern French musicians Debussy has a ready pen and\r\nexceedingly interesting critical opinions. He has served as critic for\r\nthe _Revue blanche_ and for _Gil Blas_, and many articles on a wide\r\nrange of subjects have appeared in these periodicals. His conversations\r\nwith M. Croche[64] have served as an amiable disguise for the\r\nexpression of his personal views on music.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to survey as a whole the personality and achievement of\r\nDebussy we discover that he has been influenced by a fair number of\r\ncomposers, but that their effect has been for the most part superficial\r\nand transitory. Such was the contributory share of Chopin and Grieg;\r\nMoussorgsky is prominently influential alike for his dramatic style and\r\nhis fidelity to nature; other Neo-Russians have by their orchestral\r\nidiom helped to cultivate his sense of timbre; Fauré and Chabrier\r\nboth guided him harmonically; Massenet with his sure craftsmanship had\r\nmore than a casual admiration from Debussy; even the fantastic figure\r\nof Erik Satie, an exaggerated symbolistic musician of grotesque ideas\r\nbut inefficient technique, helped him to avoid the banal path. But the\r\nmainstay of Debussy's reputation is simply that of his concrete musical\r\ngifts, his inventiveness, his ability to characterize, and pervading\r\næsthetic instinct. It is not by virtue of his determination to be\r\nimpressionistic in music, nor by the extension of the possibilities of\r\nthe whole-tone scale, or free modal harmonization, nor by his original\r\npianistic style, despite the intrinsic and historic significance\r\nof these, that he has come to be the leading representative of\r\nultra-modern French composers of the revolutionary type, in opposition\r\nto the reactionary if modernistic d'Indy. It is because a certain\r\ncreative field, which others had approached tentatively, has been made\r\nto yield a scope of subject, a variety of utterance and an æsthetic\r\nimport hitherto totally unsuspected. While the impressionistic (or\r\nsymbolistic) style has in Debussy's hand become a flexible, fanciful,\r\nfantastic or poignantly human idiom, its real weight can be appreciated\r\nonly by neglecting the harmonic novelty or the stylistic medium\r\nand concentrating on the direct utterance of the music itself. It\r\nis through this basic eloquence of musical speech that Debussy is\r\nsignificant. It is for this reason that, with Strauss, he must be\r\nregarded as the chief creative figure of his generation. To realize the\r\nsimple, almost primitive, attitude of Debussy toward his art it may\r\nbe illuminating to quote from an article from his pen in response to\r\ninquiries 'On the present state of French music,' put by Paul Landormy\r\nin the _Revue bleue_ (1904), translated by Philip Hale.[65]\r\n\r\n'French music is clearness, elegance, simple and natural declamation;\r\nFrench music wishes, first of all, to give pleasure. Couperin,\r\nRameau--these are true Frenchmen.' Debussy has always admired Rameau,\r\nwitness his _Hommage à Rameau_ in the first set of the _Images_ for\r\npiano and his obvious predilection for the eighteenth-century qualities\r\nof lucidity and transparent outline of much of his music. It must not\r\nbe forgotten that Debussy has joined Saint-Saëns, d'Indy, and Dukas in\r\nthe revision of Rameau's works for the complete edition. Later in the\r\nsame article we find Debussy reiterating the view expressed above as to\r\nthe function of music with an insistence that is both Latin and even\r\nPagan in the best sense. 'Music should be cleared of all scientific\r\napparatus. Music should seek humbly _to give pleasure_; great beauty is\r\npossible between these limits. Extreme complexity is the contrary of\r\nart. Beauty should be perceptible; it should impose itself on us, or\r\ninsinuate itself, without any effort on our part to grasp it. Look at\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, Mozart! These are great artists.'\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Debussy has brought the impressionistic and symbolistic\r\nstyle into music; he has evolved a supple harmonic idiom devoid\r\nof monotony, not chiefly characterized by the whole-tone scale as\r\nmany believe, but comprising a simple style, a taking archaism, an\r\napplication of modal style, and an extension of the uses of ninths\r\nand other chords. He has developed an incredibly simple and yet\r\neffective dramatic style, which makes 'Pelléas and Mélisande' one of\r\nthe significant works of the century. He has extended the nuances and\r\nthe figures of piano style, and has increased the subdivision of the\r\norchestra into delicate, almost opalescent, timbres. But more than\r\nall, he has given to music a new type of poetry, a rarefied humanity,\r\nand new revelations of the imagination. It is too soon to judge of the\r\ndurability of his work, but his historical position is secure--a\r\nlineal descendant of French eighteenth-century great musicians with the\r\nvision and the creative daring of the twentieth.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Claude Debussy]\r\n                       _After a photo from life_\r\n\r\nIf the widespread imitation of Debussy may be taken as an indication,\r\nno further proof of the vitality of his creative innovations is\r\nneeded. Richard Strauss has not disdained to use the whole-tone scale\r\nin _Salome_ (the entrance of Herod), Reger has followed suit in the\r\n'Romantic Suite'; Puccini has drawn upon the same idiom in 'The Girl of\r\nthe Golden West'; Cyril Scott in England and Charles Martin Loeffler\r\nin the United States have gone to the same source, despite their\r\nindisputably individual attainments. In Paris itself the followers of\r\nDebussy are rife, and his influence is as contagious as that of Wagner\r\nthirty years ago. A figure long misjudged as a mere echo of Debussy,\r\nwho after an interval of fifteen years has shown that he steadily\r\nfollowed his own path in spite of some manifest obligations to the\r\nfounder of impressionism in music is Maurice Ravel. Since he is easily\r\nsecond in importance among the members of the 'atmospheric' group, he\r\ndeserves, therefore, to be considered immediately after Debussy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nJoseph-Maurice Ravel was born March 7, 1875, in the town of Ciboure,\r\nin the department of the Basses-Pyrénées in the extreme southwest of\r\nFrance, close to the Spanish border. From early childhood, however,\r\nhe lived in Paris. At the age of twelve his predisposition toward\r\nmusic asserted itself by his delight in the major seventh chord, which\r\nhe employed with such insight later.[66] He was accordingly given\r\nlessons in piano-playing and composition. His earliest works were some\r\nvariations on a chorale by Schumann, and the first movement of a\r\nsonata. In 1889 he entered the Paris Conservatory, where he studied the\r\npiano with de Bériot, harmony with Pessard, counterpoint and fugue with\r\nGedalge, and composition with Fauré. Despite his application he did not\r\nmeet with the success his efforts deserved. In 1901, however, he was\r\nawarded the second _prix de Rome_ for his cantata _Myrrha_, and it is\r\nsaid that some of the jury favored him as a choice for the first prize.\r\nIn the two following years he was unsuccessful, and in 1904 he did not\r\nattempt to compete. In 1905 he offered himself as candidate, but was\r\nrefused permission. This exclusion, when he had already attracted much\r\nattention as a composer, which may have been partly due to his audacity\r\nin 'writing down' ironically to the reactionary jury of 1901, aroused\r\nprotests of so violent a nature as to start an inquiry into conditions\r\nat the Conservatory, with the result that Théodore Dubois was forced to\r\nresign as director and Gabriel Fauré was appointed in his place. Since\r\nthen Ravel has devoted himself entirely to composition and the record\r\nof his life is to be found most persuasively in his work. Ravel has\r\nserved several times on the committee of the _Société Nationale_, and\r\nhe is a charter member of the _Société Musicale Indépendante_.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a consideration of Ravel's music, it may be well\r\nto enumerate the various influences he has undergone. The first was\r\nChabrier, whose _Trois Valses romantiques_ for two pianos aroused his\r\nadmiration when scarcely more than a boy. Then, as in the case of\r\nDebussy, the fantastic personality and curious music of Erik Satie\r\nappealed to his imagination. Some of Fauré's harmonic procedures and\r\nsome of his mannerisms, such as the abuse of sequence, have left their\r\ntraces in the pupil. Some of Debussy's harmonic innovations have\r\nobviously affected Ravel, just as he has accepted his impressionism,\r\nbut a careful study of the latter's works will show a definite line\r\nof cleavage in both particulars, beginning at an early stage of his\r\ncareer. The exoticism of the Neo-Russians and their sense of orchestral\r\ntimbre have undoubtedly exercised a powerful charm over Ravel.\r\n\r\nAfter some unpublished songs, and a _Sérénade grotesque_ for piano\r\ncomposed in 1894, Ravel published his first music in 1895, a _Menuet\r\nantique_ for piano, which Roland Manuel describes as 'a curious work\r\nin which are voluntarily opposed, so it seems, scholastic contrapuntal\r\nartifices and the most charming radicalism (_hardiesses_).' Ravel's\r\nnext work was two pieces for two pianos entitled _Les Sites\r\nAuriculaires_, one a _Habañera_ (1895), showing an astonishing harmonic\r\nindependence for so young a composer, which was utilized later in the\r\n'Spanish Rhapsody' for orchestra, the other _Entre Cloches_ (1896),\r\nwhich is said to have been incorporated in _La Vallée des Cloches_,\r\nincluded in the piano pieces entitled _Miroirs_ in 1896 also. Ravel\r\ncomposed the first of his published songs, _Sainte_, on a poem by\r\nMallarmé, for which the music is charmingly archaic, somewhat in\r\nFauré's manner, but not devoid of independence. In 1898 followed\r\nthe 'Two Epigrams' for voice and piano, on texts by Clément Marot\r\n(fifteenth century), in which Ravel again appropriately employed\r\nan archaic idiom curiously intermingled with ninth chords. In this\r\nsame year Ravel composed his first orchestral work, the overture\r\n_Shéhérazade_ (performed by the National Society in the following\r\nyear), which has never been published. Two piano pieces, a _Pavane\r\npour une infante défunte_ (1899), whose poignantly elegiac mood shows\r\nits composer in a new light as regards sensibility, and brilliant\r\n_tour de force_, _Jeux d'eau_ (1901), full of harmonic novelty and\r\nstrikingly original pianistic style, are both significant advances. It\r\nwas the bold personality of the latter piece that served to expose and\r\naccentuate the ironic caricature of a sentimental style to be found\r\nin _Myrrha_ which prejudiced a reactionary jury against him. A string\r\nquartet (1902-03) at once made a profound impression on account of the\r\nrelative youth of its composer, for its command of a difficult medium,\r\nits polish and symmetry of form, its poetry and depth of sentiment. If\r\nthe last two movements are inferior in substance and inspiration, the\r\nscherzo is piquant and novel, while the first movement, particularly\r\nin its poetic close, stands in the front rank of modern French\r\nchamber music literature. If the theme of the first movement by its\r\nharmonization in a sequence of seventh chords suggests Fauré, there\r\nis no denying the personality of the work as a whole. Three songs for\r\nvoice and orchestra, _Shéhérazade_ (1903), on poems by Tristan Klingsor\r\n(pseudonym for Tristan Leclère), are unequal, but the first, _Asie_,\r\nreflects the varied exoticism of its text with sympathetic charm.\r\n\r\nFive pieces for piano entitled _Miroirs_ (1905) present Ravel's\r\nindividuality in a clear light as regards his impressionistic\r\nmethod. Without the maturity of a later collection of piano pieces,\r\nthey reflect, as their title indicates, various aspects of nature\r\nwith the illusion demanded by impressionistic method, and at the\r\nsame time exhibit profundity of insight and delineative poetry. The\r\nfoundation of Ravel's thematic treatment, unusual pianistic idiom,\r\nhis personal harmonic flavor, and his personal sentiment are all to\r\nbe found therein. In these pieces no trace is to be found of external\r\ninfluence; the composer speaks in his own voice. _Oiseaux tristes_,\r\na melancholy landscape with some realistic touches; _Une barque sur\r\nl'Océan_, broadly impressionistic sketch of large dimensions; _Alborada\r\ndel Graciosa_, exhibiting that Spanish exoticism which has often\r\ntempted Ravel; and _La Vallé des Cloches_, of sombre yet highly poetic\r\natmosphere, are the most striking. A sonatina for piano of the same\r\nyear pleases by the polish of its form, its successful correlation\r\nof detail and the individuality of its contents. A humorous song,\r\n'The Toy's Christmas' (also 1905), later provided with orchestral\r\naccompaniment, is an ingenious and vivacious trifle.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 Ravel reasserted his gifts as a delicate realist with the songs\r\nentitled 'Natural Histories,' on texts by Jules Renard. With a musical\r\nimagery that is at once ironic and replete with sensitive observation,\r\nRavel depicts the peacock, the cricket, the swan, and other birds. An\r\nIntroduction and Allegro (1906) for harp with accompaniment of string\r\nquartet, flute and clarinet is chiefly remarkable for the grateful\r\nvirtuosity with which the harp is treated. In 1907 Ravel showed at\r\nonce technical mastery of the orchestra and a skillful reproduction of\r\nSpanish atmosphere with a 'Spanish Rhapsody,' which is both brilliant\r\nand poetic. This work must be considered with Chabrier's _España_\r\nand Debussy's _Ibéria_ as one of the graphic pictures of exoticism\r\nin French musical literature. To this same year belongs 'The Spanish\r\nHour,' text by Franc Nohain entitled a 'musical comedy' (but not in our\r\nsense), in which Ravel attempted to revive the manner of the _opera\r\nbuffa_. The comedy contains inherent improbabilities and the text is\r\noften far from inspiring, but Ravel has written ingenious, humorous and\r\npoetic music which far exceeds the book in value. This opera presents\r\na running commentary in the orchestra on a few motives, leaving the\r\nvoices to declaim with freedom, while the brilliant and picturesque\r\norchestration adds greatly to vivacity and charm of the music.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Ravel composed a set of four-hand pieces, 'Mother Goose,' of\r\ningenuity, humor, and poetic insight. These pieces have since been\r\norchestrated with incomparable finesse and knowledge of instrumental\r\nresource, forming an orchestral suite, and, with the addition of a\r\nprelude and various interludes, they have also been transformed into\r\na ballet. In 1908, also, Ravel composed three poems for the piano,\r\n_Gaspard de la Nuit_, on prose fragments by Aloysius Bertrand, which\r\nin technical style and contents mark the acme of his achievement in\r\nliterature for the piano. _Ondine_ and _Scarbo_, the first and third\r\nof these pieces, illustrate their 'programs' with an illuminating\r\npoetry that is both brilliant and profound in insight. The second,\r\n_Le Gibbet_, with a persistent pedal note in the right hand over\r\nextraordinarily ingenious harmonies, possesses a genuinely sinister and\r\ntragic depth.\r\n\r\nThese poems contrast sharply with Debussy's _Images_ of the same year.\r\nThe latter are more obviously impressionistic, but Ravel has disposed\r\nhis uncanny technical equipment with such expressive mastery and\r\nsuch interpretative vitality as to fear no comparison with the older\r\ncomposer. If by contrast the _Valse nobles et sentimentales_ (1910)\r\nfor piano are agreeable _jeux d'esprit_, they none the less possess\r\nqualities that win our admiration. Frank boldness of style, fantastic\r\nirony, and sentimental poetry go hand in hand, united by a grateful\r\npiano idiom. The epilogue in particular, with its reminiscences of\r\nvarious waltzes, gives a formal continuity which relieves the set as a\r\nwhole from any charge of disjointedness.\r\n\r\nRavel's masterpiece is his 'choreographic symphony' _Daphnis et Chloé_\r\n(1906-11), first performed by Diaghilev's Russian Ballet in 1912. In\r\nthis work Ravel disproves emphatically the possible charge that he is a\r\ncomposer of miniatures, for from the formal aspects it shows continuity\r\nand coördination of development in the symphonic manipulation of its\r\nmotives. Dramatically it is in remarkable accord with the atmosphere,\r\nthe action and the development of the scenario by the famous\r\nballet-master and author of plots Michel Fokine. The music not only\r\npossesses interpretative vitality on a far larger scale than Ravel has\r\never shown before, but, aside from its astonishing brilliancy and\r\nits coloristic poetry, it has a contrapuntal vigor of invention and\r\ntreatment which are absolutely convincing. From the harmonic standpoint\r\nRavel has attained a new freedom and an elastic suppleness of idiom\r\nthat is bewildering. His treatment of a large orchestra, augmented by\r\nthe use of a mixed chorus behind the scenes, is vitally brilliant and\r\nmarvellously poetic even in the light of his previous achievements.\r\nAll in all, _Daphnis et Chloé_ is one of the most significant dramatic\r\nworks of recent years, and can worthily be placed side by side with\r\nDebussy's _Pelléas et Mélisande_ and Dukas' _Ariane et Barbe-bleue_ for\r\nits intrinsic merits and historical attributes.\r\n\r\nFor some years Ravel has been engaged upon a setting of Hauptmann's\r\n_Versunkene Glocke_. It is also announced that he is at work upon a\r\ntrio, a concerto for piano on Basque themes, and an oratorio, _Saint\r\nFrançois d'Assise_. With his recent successes in mind, these projected\r\nworks engage a lively expectation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it must be acknowledged that Ravel cannot, like Debussy,\r\nclaim to be a pioneer. He was fortunate in being enabled to profit\r\nby the swift development of new idioms, to absorb the exuberance of\r\nChabrier, the suave mysticism of Fauré, the illuminating impressionism\r\nof Debussy, and the scintillant exoticism of the Neo-Russians. But,\r\nwhile he owes no more to his predecessors than Debussy, he has had the\r\nadvantage of having matured his style at an age which was relatively\r\nin advance of Debussy. It must be recognized that as a whole Ravel's\r\nmusic lies nearer the surface of the human heart than Debussy's. It\r\nis not usual to find that depth of poetry or of human sentiment which\r\ndistinguishes so considerable a portion of Debussy's music. Ravel, on\r\nthe other hand, is more expansive in his scope; he captivates us with\r\nhis humor, his irony, his dappling brilliancy, and with an almost\r\nmetallic grasp in execution of a pre-conceived plan. His harmonic\r\ntransformations exert a literal fascination, though their technical\r\nfacility obscures their purpose, but underneath there is seldom an\r\ninner deficiency of sentiment. If his impressionism is tinged with\r\nquasi-realistic effects, there is no lack of genuine homogeneity\r\nof style. In fact, his skillful blending of the two tendencies is\r\none of the chief features of his originality. In such works as the\r\n_Pavane_, the first movement of the String Quartet, in _Asie_ from\r\n_Shéhérazade_, in _La Vallée des Cloches_, in _Ondine_ and _Le Gibbet_,\r\nand in many episodes of _Daphnis et Chloé_ Ravel offers a convincingly\r\nhuman sentiment which only emphasizes his essential versatility of\r\nexpression. For in his characteristic vein of ironic brilliance and\r\nfantastic subtlety he carries all before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nIf the work of Bruneau and Charpentier does not follow in historic or\r\nchronological sequence that of Debussy and Ravel, their juxtaposition\r\nis defensible since the former in common with the latter have received\r\ntheir individual stimulus from sources extraneous to music. In the case\r\nof Bruneau the vitalizing motive is the literary realism of Émile Zola;\r\nin that of Charpentier the direct inspiration comes from socialism or\r\nat least a socialistic outlook.\r\n\r\nLouis-Charles-Bonaventure-Alfred Bruneau was born in Paris, on March\r\n1, 1857. His father played the violin, his mother was a painter, thus\r\nan æsthetic environment favored his artistic development. Alfred\r\nBruneau entered the Paris Conservatory at the age of sixteen; three\r\nyears later he was awarded the first prize for violoncello playing. He\r\nstudied harmony for three years in Savard's class, became a pupil of\r\nMassenet and was the first to win the second _prix de Rome_ in 1881\r\nwith a cantata _Geneviève_. For some years previously Bruneau had been\r\na member of Pasdeloup's orchestra, and in 1884 an _Overture héroïque_\r\n(1885) was played by this organization. Other orchestral works--_La\r\nBelle au bois dormant_ (1884) and _Penthesilée_ (a symphonic poem with\r\nchorus, 1888)--belong to this period.\r\n\r\nDespite some fifty songs, choruses, a Requiem, and some pieces for\r\nvarious wind instruments and piano, Bruneau is essentially a dramatic\r\ncomposer, and it is chiefly as such that he deserves consideration. His\r\nfirst dramatic work, _Kérim_, the text by Millet and Lavedan (1886),\r\nis an unpretentious opera of eminently lyric vein, in which a facile\r\norientalism plays a prominent part. It displays the technical fluidity\r\nwhich might be expected of a pupil of Massenet, and possesses a slight,\r\nthough palpable, individuality. A ballet, _Les Bacchantes_ (1887),\r\nnot published until 1912 and recently performed, is in the old style\r\nof detached pieces without continuous music. Here Bruneau has been\r\nsuccessful in dramatic characterization, but the music is again largely\r\na reflection of Massenet.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1891 that Bruneau gave evidence of his characteristic\r\nstyle and individual dramatic method which he has since pursued\r\nsteadily. French musicians had awakened to the permanent significance\r\nof Wagner's dramatic principles, and it is not surprising, therefore,\r\nto find that Bruneau accepted these in slight degree. His Wagnerian\r\nobligations are virtually limited to an attempt to unite music and text\r\nas intimately as possible, to employ leading-motives as symbols of\r\npersons or ideas, and to avoid formal melody in the voice parts except\r\nat essentially lyric moments. His development of motives, while to a\r\ncertain extent symphonic, is in fact markedly different from that of\r\nWagner, and his recitatives depart from the traditional accompanied\r\nrecitatives in that they employ as nearly as possible the inflections\r\nof natural speech over single chords.\r\n\r\nThe kernel of Bruneau's dramatic method lies in his ardent championing\r\nof realism as a guiding principle in general, and his admiration for\r\nÉmile Zola as a man and as a literary artist in particular. With\r\nthe exception of _Kérim_ all his operas have been on subjects taken\r\nfrom Zola's works, or on texts by Zola himself. With the ideals of\r\nrealism in mind, Bruneau has avoided legendary subjects, although\r\nmany of his works are symbolic, and he has preferred to treat dramas\r\nof everyday life, animated by the passions of ordinary mortals. As\r\nDebussy reflected the impressionism or symbolism of poets, painters,\r\nand dramatists in his music, so Bruneau's operas are a counterpart of\r\nthe realistic movement. In place, therefore, of the stilted, unreal\r\naction which disfigures even the finest conceptions of Wagner, Bruneau\r\nhas sought to replace it with a lifelike, tense, and rapid simulation\r\nof life itself. His realism has even led to the discarding in his later\r\noperas of verse for prose from obvious realistic considerations. In\r\nspite of some Teutonic sources, Bruneau is eminently Gallic in his\r\nmusical and dramatic standpoint, and, while certain formulas of his\r\nteacher, Massenet, persist for a time, in the main he is rigorously\r\nindependent. For a time Bruneau was considered revolutionary in his\r\nharmonic standpoint, but musically at least he cannot be called\r\niconoclastic, or even progressive. The strength of his achievement lies\r\nentirely in his qualities as a dramatist pure and simple.\r\n\r\nThe first work which embodied Bruneau's realistic attitude was _Le\r\nRêve_ (1891), text by Gallet after Zola's novel. The essence of the\r\nwork dramatically lies in the mystical temperament of the heroine,\r\nAngélique, who loves the son of a priest (born before his father, a\r\nwidower, entered the priesthood) despite the opposition of his father.\r\nWhen she is apparently dying the priest restores her by a miracle and\r\nconsents to the marriage, only to have the bride fall lifeless as she\r\nleaves the church. While Bruneau's musical treatment of Angélique's\r\nmystical hallucinations is in a sentimental manner that recalls\r\nMassenet, the opera as a whole shows dramatic power of an independent\r\ncharacter. Bruneau's second opera in his new style, _L'Attaque du\r\nMoulin_ (1893), the dramatization by Gallet of a story by Zola in _Les\r\nSoirées de Médan_, dealing with an episode of the Franco-Prussian war,\r\nis far more vital both in drama and music. The mill, the source of life\r\nto the miller, Merlier, and his daughter Françoise, is attacked by the\r\nenemy. Dominique, a foreigner, who is betrothed to Françoise, is found\r\nwith powder marks on his hands and is condemned to be shot. The enemy\r\nretreat, leaving a sentinel at the mill. The sentinel is assassinated\r\nand Merlier is to be shot for the deed. Although Dominique confesses\r\nthat he did the deed, Merlier dies in his stead so that his daughter\r\nmay be happy. Bruneau has been equally happy in delineating the peace\r\nwhich reigns at the mill before the arrival of the enemy and the\r\ncelebration of Françoise's betrothal, and in depicting the brutalities\r\nof war and the unselfish death of Merlier. _L'Attaque du Moulin_ is a\r\nwork of solid inspiration, clarity of style and vivid dramatic force.\r\nThe Institute of France awarded the Monbinne prize to its composer.\r\n\r\n_Messidor_ (1897), text by Zola himself, deals with the struggle\r\nbetween capital and labor and the love of the poor Guillaume for\r\nthe capitalist's daughter Hélène. The capitalist is ruined, saner\r\neconomic conditions are brought about and the lovers are united.\r\nFor a drama which is both sociological and symbolistic Bruneau\r\nhas written music of broadly humanitarian character and a vitally\r\ndescriptive vigor. His musical style is firmer and his conceptions\r\nare realized with less crudeness than in previous works. _L'Ouragan_\r\n(1901), whose action turns upon a devastating hurricane in a fishing\r\nvillage, and also the tempestuous passions of its inhabitants, has a\r\nprimitive quality characteristic of both author and composer. There\r\nis conscious symbolism in this work also in the distinction of types\r\nfound in the three feminine characters. Of this opera Debussy wrote:\r\n'He (Bruneau) has, among all musicians, a fine contempt for formulas,\r\nhe walks across his harmonies without troubling himself as to their\r\ngrammatical sonorous virtue; he perceives melodic associations that\r\nsome would qualify too quickly as \"monstrous\" when they are simply\r\nunaccustomed.'[67]\r\n\r\n_L'Enfant roi_ (1905), _Naïs Micoulin_ (1907), and _La Faute de l'Abbé\r\nMouret_ (1907) display qualities similar to Bruneau's other operas, in\r\nwhich close adjustment to the drama and consistent musical treatment\r\nare the notable features. _Naïs Micoulin_, text by Bruneau himself\r\nafter Zola's novel, is particularly admirable for its clarity of style,\r\nits absence of mannerism, and its vital depiction of two types of\r\njealousy and the faithful devotion of the hunchback, Toine.\r\n\r\nBeyond his activity as a dramatic composer, especial mention should\r\nbe made of Bruneau's work as a critic. He has contributed to many\r\nmagazines, and he has acted as musical critic for the _Gil Blas_,\r\n_Le Figaro_, and _Le Matin_. He has collected three volumes of\r\nable criticism, _Musiques d'hier et de demain_ (1900), _La Musique\r\nFrançaise_ (1901), containing much valuable historical material, and\r\n_Musiques de Russie et Musiciens de France_ (1903). In these volumes he\r\nhas shown himself a vigorous and broad critic of catholicity of taste\r\nand striking discrimination.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the dramatic work of Bruneau as a whole, he must be\r\nconsidered as representing a sincere phase of French evolution at\r\na critical time. While it is questionable whether realism can be a\r\npermanently successful basis for opera, a form in which æsthetic\r\ncompromise and illusion are inherent, there is no denying the\r\ncourageous independence of his position and the plausible defense\r\nof his methods which his operas constitute. It must be confessed,\r\nhowever, that Bruneau's dramatic instinct takes precedence over his\r\nconcrete musical gifts and the former carries off many scenes and\r\nepisodes in which the latter lags behind. In short, Bruneau's gift\r\nfor the stage is unquestionable, and his dramatic innovations must\r\nremain identified with French progress in this medium. His most obvious\r\ndefect lies in the inequality of his musical inspiration. If his\r\nmelodic sense is frank and spontaneous as in the prelude to Act I of\r\n_L'Attaque du Moulin_, the broad theme after the curtain rises in Act\r\nI of _Messidor_, the introduction and 'Sowing Song' in Act II of the\r\nsame opera, the 'Song of the Earth' in _Naïs Micoulin_, the contour\r\nof Bruneau's melodies is, on the other hand, too often awkward and\r\ndevoid of distinction. Likewise his thematic manipulation is lacking\r\nin flexibility or striking development, especially in the too obvious\r\nemployment of the devices of 'augmentation' and 'diminution' (see\r\n_L'Ouragan_, prelude to Act I). Yet the allegorical Ballet of Gold\r\nin Act III of _Messidor_ and the Introduction to Act IV of the same\r\nwork show that Bruneau has sensibility toward symphonic qualities.\r\nBruneau's harmonic idiom is rather monotonous and devoid of that subtle\r\nrecognition of style that we find in the impressionistic school. On\r\nthe other side, its wholesome vigor has the sincerity which is the\r\nhall-mark of realism. As a harmonist Bruneau is not advanced.\r\n\r\nDespite the flaws that one can find in Bruneau the musician, they are\r\nperhaps after all the defects of his virtues. At a time of wavering and\r\nuncertainty, Bruneau showed uncompromising sincerity, stuck to his\r\nguns, defied opinion with a resolution and a reckless adherence to his\r\næsthetic standpoint worthy of a friend of Zola. If his works have not\r\nthe involuntary persuasion that we find in other ultra-modern French\r\noperas, one must acknowledge a preëminent dramatic gift, possessing\r\nin its presentation of sociological and humanistic problems vitality,\r\nhigh purpose and moments of indubitable inspiration. If Bruneau's\r\nmusical defects hamper to a certain extent his wider recognition, his\r\nfearless independence, his utter contempt for imitation of others, and\r\nthe remarkable dramatic affinity between his conceptions and those of\r\nZola's are too striking not to be considered an interesting episode in\r\nFrench dramatic evolution.\r\n\r\nWhile Bruneau's operas, apart from a few performances in London,\r\nGermany, and New York, have received attention chiefly in France,\r\nGustave Charpentier, despite his relatively small productivity, has won\r\na universal recognition.\r\n\r\nGustave Charpentier was born in the town of Dieuze in Lorraine, June\r\n25, 1860. After the Franco-Prussian war his parents came to live in\r\nTourcoing, not far from Lille. As a boy Charpentier showed natural\r\naptitude for the violin, clarinet, and solfeggio, although he was\r\nobliged to work in a factory to support himself. His employer became so\r\nstruck with his musical ability that he sent him to the Conservatory\r\nat Lille, where he obtained numerous prizes. As a result of this the\r\nmunicipality of Tourcoing granted him an annual pension of twelve\r\nhundred francs to study at the Paris Conservatory. In 1881 he began his\r\nwork there as a pupil of Massart, the violinist. He was not successful\r\nin competition and, moreover, was obliged to leave to fulfill his\r\nmilitary service. Returning to the Conservatory, he took up the study\r\nof harmony and later entered Massenet's class in composition. He was\r\nunsuccessful in a fugue competition, but in 1887 he received the first\r\n_prix de Rome_ for his cantata _Dido_, which showed distinct dramatic\r\ngift and a concise and logical continuity of musical development.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome he sent back as the required proofs of his industry an\r\norchestral suite 'Impressions of Italy,' permeated with Italian\r\natmosphere and folk-song, a symphony-drama, 'The Life of a Poet,' for\r\nsolos, chorus and orchestra, which may be regarded as a precursor of\r\nhis later dramatic work, and the first act of 'Louise.' This last was,\r\nhowever, not presented to the Institute, as that institution considered\r\nthat 'The Life of a Poet' might count for two works.[68]\r\n\r\nOn returning to Paris Charpentier went to live in Montmartre, the\r\nBohemian and artistic quarter, and entered passionately into the\r\nlife about him. It presented the inspiration and material which\r\nhe wished to embody in musical conceptions. He absorbed both the\r\nsocialism of the quarter and its Bohemian disparagement of artistic\r\nand moral convention. Thus he witnessed the aspiration of artists,\r\ntheir enthusiasm for a life of freedom, together with its inevitable\r\ndegradation. He studied its types avidly, and reproduced them with a\r\nverisimilitude that has made them well nigh immortal. During these\r\nyears he composed many of the _Poèmes chantés_ (published as a whole in\r\n1894), the songs, _Les Fleurs du mal_ (1895), on poems by Baudelaire;\r\nthe _Impressions fausses_, on poems by Verlaine, including _La Veillée\r\nrouge_ (1894); symbolic variations for baritone and male chorus\r\nwith orchestra; and _La Ronde des Compagnons_ (1895), for the same\r\ncombination. In 1896 his _Sérénade à Watteau_ (the poem by Verlaine)\r\nfor voices and orchestra was performed in the Luxembourg gardens. In\r\n1898 a cantata, _Le Couronnement de la muse_, depicting an established\r\nMontmartre custom, later incorporated in 'Louise,' was given in the\r\nsquare of the Hôtel de Ville. As a whole, these vocal works, with the\r\nexception of the cantata, are of interest merely as showing the early\r\nstyle of the composer and for their premonitions of his later idiom.\r\nCharpentier is not a born song-writer and his settings of Baudelaire's\r\n_Le Jet d'eau_, _La Mort des amantes_ and _L'Invitation au voyage_, of\r\nVerlaine's _Chevaux de bois_ and _Sérénade à Watteau_ have been easily\r\nsurpassed by Debussy and Duparc. The most attractive are a setting of\r\nMauclair's _La Chanson du chemin_ for solo voice, women's chorus and\r\norchestra, and the _Impressions fausses_ by Verlaine, in which his\r\ndramatic and socialistic bent is more plausible.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Charpentier had been working steadily at his 'musical\r\nnovel' _Louise_, both text and music by himself, which he had begun\r\nat Rome. This work, perhaps the most characteristic of his style, was\r\nperformed for the first time at the Opéra-comique, February 3, 1900.\r\nIt was an instant and prolonged success, and its composer was not only\r\nfamous but prosperous financially. Since the recognition of 'Louise'\r\nCharpentier has suffered from irregular health. The production of\r\n'Julien' (1896-1904) at Paris, June 4, 1913, announced as a sequel to\r\n'Louise,' has added little to his reputation. It is founded largely\r\non the music of 'The Life of a Poet,' with added episodes which\r\ncontrast incongruously with the idiom of the earlier work. It has been\r\nannounced that Charpentier has finished a 'popular epic' entitled a\r\nTriptych. This, it is said, will contain three two-act operas with the\r\nsub-titles, _L'Amour au faubourg_, _Commédiante_, and _Tragédiante_.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Charpentier founded the _Conservatoire populaire de Mimi\r\nPinson_ (the generic slang title for the shop-girl) for encouraging\r\nthe musical education of working girls. But, despite its worthy\r\nsociological purpose, this institution has failed. Charpentier has\r\noccasionally written critical articles, among them sympathetic reviews\r\nof Bruneau's _L'Attaque du Moulin_ and _L'Ouragan_.\r\n\r\nIn considering the music and personality of Charpentier it must be\r\nrecognized at the outset that he is far removed in emotional and\r\nintellectual makeup from other prominent figures in modern French\r\nmusic. A child of the people, absorbing socialistic tendencies from his\r\nboyhood, he is a musician of the instinctive type, averse to analysis\r\nor pre-conceived theory. As Bruneau drew his inspiration from the creed\r\nof realism and the works of Zola, so Charpentier is dominated by his\r\nardent socialistic bent. His music attempts to embody his impressions\r\nof life from a democratic standpoint, in which realism and symbolism\r\nare sometimes felicitously and sometimes jarringly mingled.\r\n\r\nIn his musical idiom Charpentier stands close to Massenet, with that\r\ninvoluntary absorption of his teacher's principles which actuates\r\nmost of the pupils of that facile but marvellously grounded composer.\r\nCharpentier is far more sincere, however, in his relations to his\r\nart, in that he has not courted popularity or lowered his artistic\r\nstandard for the sake of success. Despite his obligations to Massenet,\r\nCharpentier has a vigorously independent idiom in which Bohemianism and\r\na poetic humanity are the chief ingredients. This asserts itself even\r\nif the ultimate source of his style is obvious. He is also indebted\r\nto his master for the transparent yet coloristic treatment of the\r\norchestra, in which sonority is obtained without waste or effort. If at\r\ntimes it is evident that Charpentier has not listened to Wagner without\r\nprofit, the main current of his orchestral procedures, like his basic\r\nmusical qualities, is preëminently Gallic.\r\n\r\nIn the early suite, 'Impressions of Italy' (1890), Charpentier has\r\ndepicted in a pleasing and picturesque style various aspects of nature,\r\nthe serenades of young men on leaving the inns at midnight, with\r\nresponses of mandolins and guitars; the balanced and stately walk of\r\npeasant maidens carrying water from the spring; the brisk trot of mules\r\nwith jingling harnesses and their driver's songs; the wide stretches\r\nof country seen from the heights near the 'Desert of Sorrento,' the\r\ncries of birds and the distant sounds of convent bells; and for finale\r\na realistic description of a fête night at Naples with the tarantella,\r\nfolk-songs, bands drowning each other out and general and uproarious\r\ngayety. While the musical substance of this suite is undeniably light,\r\nCharpentier has mingled Italian melodies, descriptions of nature and\r\na poetic undercurrent with an unusual atmospheric charm and glamour\r\nthat outweigh concretely musical consideration. His instinctive and\r\ncoloristic manipulation of orchestral timbres heightens greatly the\r\nprogrammistic illusion.\r\n\r\nThough the 'Life of a Poet' (1889-91), scenario and text by\r\nCharpentier, is crude and immature, it possesses indubitable dramatic\r\nvitality notwithstanding. It tells the tragedy of a young and aspiring\r\npoet who would conquer the world of expression, confident in his\r\nability. Gradually he is assailed by doubt, loses his faith and\r\nultimately recognizes that he cannot coördinate the vast problems\r\nconfronting him into unity. Seeking oblivion in drunkenness, he\r\nacknowledges his defeat and the drama of his life is over.\r\n\r\nIn this work Charpentier has placed symbolism and realism side by side\r\nin a way that is disconcerting. After an orchestral prelude entitled\r\n'Enthusiasm,' at once rough, forceful and incoherent, a mysterious\r\nchorus with the title 'Preparation' has dramatic power and human\r\nsentiment. The second and third scenes, respectively described as\r\n'Incantation' and 'In the Land of Dreams,' are still occupied with the\r\nsymbolic appeal of the poet to inspiration. Throughout this act the\r\nmusic is effective dramatically, although often not far removed from\r\ntawdry. In the second act, 'Doubt,' there is a luminous charm in the\r\nchorus sung by the 'voices of night,' an appropriate interpretation of\r\nthe poet's harassing uncertainty in the second scene, and an extremely\r\npoetic orchestral passage descriptive of his meditations, which ends\r\nthe act. In the first tableau of the third act, entitled 'Impotence,'\r\nan orchestral introduction of some length, again crudely dramatic,\r\ndepicts graphically the losing struggle of the poet for his artistic\r\nsoul. The chorus, 'voices of malediction,' curse a divinity which\r\npermits the ruin of the artist's dreams. To this, the poet, sombre\r\nand fantastic, adds his last plaint of despair and his curse. In the\r\nsecond 'picture' the poet is at a fête in Montmartre. The orchestra\r\npaints vividly the riot of cheap bands and the reckless jollity.\r\nThe chorus echoes the curse of the preceding act and dies away in\r\nmysterious murmurs. A dance orchestra (in the wings) plays a vulgar\r\npolka, a noisy military band chimes in while passing. To these a melody\r\nis dexterously added in the orchestra. A reminiscence of a chorus in\r\nthe first act is ingeniously contrived with the polka and orchestral\r\nmelody as accompaniment. The poet, now drunk, apostrophizes a wretched\r\ngirl of the streets, who replies with mocking laughter. The orchestra\r\nsuggests the æsthetic disintegration of the poet, the chorus recalls\r\nthe aspirations of his earlier life and finally the poet voices his\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n'The Life of a Poet' is interesting because it presents in a\r\nsomewhat primitive state the essential characteristics of the mature\r\nCharpentier, namely, a palpable dramatic gift, the faculty of poetic\r\nand humanizing illumination and differentiation of scenes. In the scene\r\nat Montmartre he has not only furnished a precursor of the Bohemian\r\nrealism in 'Louise,' but he has displayed considerable contrapuntal\r\nfacility. If the 'Life of a Poet' has the clearly discernible defects\r\nof youth, it has also its vitality and a spontaneous conviction which\r\nwas prophetic of the future.\r\n\r\nThe universality of appeal to be found in 'Louise' (finished in 1900,\r\nalthough begun at Rome), a 'musical novel' in four acts, text by the\r\ncomposer, lies chiefly in its simple dramatic poignancy. The story\r\nis that of an innocent girl trusting the instincts of her heart in\r\nreturning the affection of the irresponsible Bohemian poet who lives\r\nnearby; her elopement with the poet, her enthralling happiness and\r\nbrief triumph as 'Muse of Montmartre' shattered by the false report\r\nof her father's serious illness; her return to the parental dwelling,\r\nher impatient chafing at restraint, her intolerable longing to return\r\nto her lover and the facile Bohemian life; her father's anger and\r\nher brutal dismissal into the night by him, followed by his curse on\r\nParis. All is basically human and typical of life under all conditions\r\nand places. But 'Louise' contains other elements which make alike\r\nfor retentive charm and for critical admiration. In the first place,\r\nit is pervaded by an insinuating glorification of Paris as a city of\r\nfreedom and provocative attraction, a perpetual Bohemian paradise.\r\nNext, by the nature of the plot it affords an opportunity for the\r\nlibrettist to voice a socialistic assertion of the individual's right\r\nto personal liberty, somewhat sententiously uttered, and a condemnation\r\nof restraint symbolized by parental egotism. 'Louise' also contains a\r\nplausible and graphic portrayal of artist life in Montmartre, including\r\nthe time-honored ceremony of crowning its 'Muse,' by which Charpentier\r\nhas immortalized types doomed to disappear before the commercialization\r\nof the quarter for the foreign visitor. In addition Charpentier may\r\nclaim distinction for his services as a folk-lorist by introducing the\r\nstreet cries of various vendors to increase 'local color,' recalling\r\nthe ingenious choruses by Jannequin (of the sixteenth century), such as\r\n_Les Cris de Paris_ and _Le Chant des Oiseaux_. Thus in time it may be\r\nrecognized that he has fulfilled an ethnographic purpose of some import.\r\n\r\nAs the dramatic attraction of 'Louise' resides in its simplicity,\r\nso also its musical value resides in its continuous spontaneity,\r\nits limpidity of style, devoid of all pretentious scholasticism, in\r\nwhich, however, there is plenty of technical skill and unostentatious\r\nmastery of material. Charpentier's dramatic and musical idiom follows\r\nthe conception of Massenet, in which the constituent elements are\r\nbalanced, without superfluous insistence upon either. He employs formal\r\nlyricism, except when the situation demands it, uses a flowing and\r\nmelodic declamation which gives free play to the annunciation of the\r\ntext. He employs motives freely, not in the Wagnerian fashion, however,\r\nbut in their flexible manipulation succeeds in giving the needful\r\ntouches of detailed characterization. If his orchestral sonority verges\r\noccasionally upon coarseness, as a whole it enhances and colors the\r\ndramatic emotions with remarkable skill and poetic fancy.\r\n\r\nBut, aside from the question of dramatic method, it is the freshness\r\nof invention, the skill in characterization, and the ebullient musical\r\nimaginativeness of 'Louise' which makes it so unusual among operas.\r\nIt is more accurate and illusive in its picture of Bohemianism\r\nthan Puccini's _La Bohème_, and possesses far more human depth and\r\nemotional sincerity throughout. In this respect also it is far above\r\nthe generality of Massenet's operas, and may be compared, despite\r\ntheir essential difference in musical individuality, to the operas of\r\nBruneau. Charpentier is more of a poet, and his musical invention is\r\nfar readier. While it may be needless to particularize the domestic\r\nscenes in the first act; the prelude to the second act, 'The City\r\nAwakens,' with the scene before the dawn in which the rag-pickers,\r\nthe coal-gleaners, and other characters of the night-world discuss\r\nof life as they have found it; the second scene in the same act, the\r\ndressmaker's workshop, with an orchestral part for the sewing machine,\r\nin which the sewers converse idly and try to account for Louise's\r\nmoodiness, the whole first tableau of the third act, in which Julien\r\nand Louise sing of the lure of Paris; Louise's scene with her father in\r\nthe fourth act, all these are concrete examples of the interpretative\r\npower of Charpentier the dramatist and composer.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to be enthusiastic over Julien. If the hero justifies\r\nthe opposition of Louise's parents (for the story of 'The Life of a\r\nPoet' forms its dramatic basis), the introduction of many allegorical\r\nor symbolic episodes not only mars the continuity of the drama, but\r\ntheir musical style offends by its difference from that of the music\r\nof 'The Life of a Poet,' upon which Charpentier has drawn so freely\r\nfor the later opera. While in many instances Charpentier has shown\r\ningenuity in adapting his earlier music, the total result of his labors\r\nhas not only been disappointing but disillusionizing in the extreme.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, Charpentier, the poet of 'Impressions of Italy,' the\r\ncrude but forceful dramatist of the 'Poet's Life,' the mature artist\r\nof 'Louise,' has accomplished certain unique aspects of realism with\r\na symbolic or sociological undercurrent. Limited as he is to 'the\r\nquarter,' he has been also universal, and his sincere and picturesque\r\nvision has something of permanence. As a pupil of Massenet he does\r\nnot belong to the vanguard, but his plausible synthesis of seemingly\r\ncontradictory elements has left a permanent impress in the annals of\r\nmodern French music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nWhile categorical classification is not always essential in criticism,\r\nit is somewhat discommoding to acknowledge that a composer cannot\r\nconveniently be placed under one logical and comprehensive heading.\r\nWhile assimilation of qualities peculiar to two opposing groups can\r\nbe unified to a considerable extent, the work of such an artist is\r\ninevitably lacking in complete homogeneity. Such a figure is Dukas,\r\nwho, nevertheless, must be considered a force of considerable vitality\r\nin present-day French music.\r\n\r\nPaul Dukas was born in Paris, October 1, 1865. Toward his fourteenth\r\nyear his musical gifts asserted themselves. In 1881, after some\r\npreliminary study, he entered the Paris Conservatory, where he was a\r\npupil of Mathias (piano), Dubois (harmony), and Guiraud (composition).\r\nIn 1888 he was awarded the second _prix de Rome_ for his cantata\r\n_Valleda_. Since he was passed over entirely in the competition\r\nof the following year, he left the Conservatory and fulfilled his\r\nmilitary service. At this period he had composed three overtures, of\r\nwhich the last, _Polyeucte_, alone has been published and performed.\r\nIn his _Cours de Composition_,[69] d'Indy discloses that Dukas was\r\nill-satisfied with the instruction he received at the Conservatory,\r\nand that he subsequently made a profound study of the classics and\r\nevolved his own technical idiom. Dukas, however, shows the effect of\r\ntwo schools, that of Franck in much of his instrumental music, and a\r\nsympathy with that of Debussy in the dramatic field. To acknowledge\r\nthis does not mean to tax him with lack of individuality, but merely to\r\nrecognize the confluence of opposing viewpoints.\r\n\r\nThe overture _Polyeucte_ (1891) shows surprising command for so young\r\na man of the technique of composition and orchestration, although\r\nunnecessarily elaborate in the former particular. It has the classic\r\ndignity of Corneille and at the same time is sincerely dramatic. The\r\nSymphony in C (1895-96) shows considerable progress in many respects:\r\nclearer part writing, unpretentious yet logical construction, no\r\napparent ambition other than to write sincerely within the limits of\r\nnormal symphonic style. There is also marked advance in clarity and\r\nbrilliance in the orchestral style. In 1897 Dukas made a pronounced\r\nhit with his fantastic and imaginative Scherzo, _L'Apprenti sorcier_,\r\nafter Goethe's ballad, first performed at a concert of the National\r\nSociety. This work is one of the landmarks of modern French music for\r\nits elastic fluency of style, the descriptive imagery of its music,\r\nand, above all, its personal note, in which the orchestra was treated\r\nwith dazzling mastery.\r\n\r\nA Sonata for piano (1899-1900) forsakes the vein of programmistic\r\n_tour de force_ entirely and exhibits a dignified, almost classic,\r\nstyle whose workmanship is admirable throughout. The theme of the\r\nfirst movement is distinguished, the second less interesting until\r\nit appears in the recapitulation with deft canonic imitation. The\r\nslow movement is somewhat cold and lacking in inner sentiment; the\r\nscherzo is individual, and the finale solid. Similarly the 'Variations,\r\nInterlude and Finale,' on a theme by Rameau, for piano (1902), is not\r\nonly composed with similar preoccupation for thorough workmanship,\r\nbut its spirit, save for some ever-present harmonic boldness, seems\r\nto have proceeded from the epoch of the theme. As a matter of fact,\r\nthese variations show a post-Beethovenian ingenuity, and genuine skill\r\nin perceiving the gracious theme of Rameau in different and engaging\r\nlights that make this work conspicuous among piano literature in modern\r\nFrench music. But this music is strongly suggestive of d'Indy and the\r\nSchola. A Villanelle for horn and piano (1906) is a charming piece\r\nwhich achieves individuality despite the limitations of the horn.\r\n\r\nBut when Dukas' music for Maeterlinck's _Ariane et Barbe Bleue_ (1907)\r\nwas performed May 10, 1907, after he had begun and rejected 'Horn and\r\nRiemenhild' (1892) and 'The Tree of Science' (1899), a greater surprise\r\nwas in store than upon the occasion when _L'Apprenti Sorcier_ was\r\nplayed for the first time.\r\n\r\nInstead of the shrinking figure of the fairy-tale, Ariane is a\r\nrepresentative of the feminist movement, if not almost a militant\r\nsuffragette, who flatly disobeys Bluebeard, opens all the forbidden\r\ndoors to deck herself with jewels, releases her captive sisters, helps\r\nthem to free Bluebeard when the infuriated peasants have attacked\r\nand bound him, and then returns to her home, leaving her infatuated\r\nsisters who have too little imagination to make a decision. Dukas has\r\ntreated this story in a style that at once admits a coherent and almost\r\nsymphonic development of motives, and employs a harmonic idiom that\r\nprofits by all that Debussy has done to extend the whole-tone scale.\r\nDukas does not employ this scale as Debussy has done, but it is obvious\r\nthat he never would have gone so far if it had not been for his pioneer\r\ncontemporary. Instead of the translucent orchestra of _Pelléas_,\r\nDukas has employed one that is appropriately far more robust, but\r\nwhich he has nevertheless used with discretion and reserve. He has\r\ntaken advantage of the discovery of the jewels in the first act to\r\nemploy coloristic resources lavishly. Despite the complex obligations\r\nin the matter of style, Dukas has produced music of a spontaneously\r\ndecorative and dramatic type, which makes this opera significant among\r\nthe works of recent years. While _Ariane_ is unequal, the first scene,\r\nexcellently worked-out ensemble, the close of the first act, the\r\nintroduction and first scene of the second, and the close of the work\r\ncannot be effaced from the records of modern French opera.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, Dukas had another success with his _poëme dansant, La Péri_,\r\non a scenario of his own, which has been exquisitely interpreted by\r\nMlle. Trouhanova, to whom it is dedicated. Here is a work of the ballet\r\ntype, which unites felicitously a sense of structure with a gift for\r\natmospheric interpretation. In this respect, _La Péri_ is one of the\r\nmost satisfactory of Dukas' works, and one in which his encyclopedic\r\nknowledge and his imaginative gifts are best displayed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his gifts as a composer, Dukas is an editor and critic\r\nof distinction. He has retouched some concertos for violin and clavecin\r\nby Couperin; he has revised _Les Indes galantes_, _La Princesse de\r\nNavarre_ and _Zephyre_ by Rameau for the complete edition of that\r\nmaster's works. He made a four-hand arrangement of Saint-Saëns' _Samson\r\net Dalila_, and together with that distinguished composer finished and\r\norchestrated _Fredegonde_, an opera left incomplete by Guiraud at his\r\ndeath. In addition, Dukas' articles for the _Revue Hebdomadaire_ and\r\nthe _Gazette des Beaux Arts_ display erudition and the clairvoyant\r\njudgment of the born critic.\r\n\r\nThus, although attaching himself to no one group exclusively, Dukas\r\nhas, by his capacity for architectural treatment of instrumental forms\r\nand his atmospheric gift in dramatic characterization, attained a\r\nposition of dignity and individual expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nIt is not within the province of this chapter to be all-inclusive, but\r\nmerely to recognize the achievement of the more notable figures. In\r\nconsequence a brief mention of some composers of lesser stature, and a\r\nslight enlargement upon two of the more distinguished, will suffice to\r\naccount for present-day activity. There are, however, two precursors\r\nof modern French music, who from the circumstances of their lives and\r\ntalent have not reached the fruition which they might have deserved.\r\nThe first of these, Ernest Fanelli, for thirty years lived the life\r\nof an obscure and impoverished musician, playing the triangle in a\r\nsmall orchestra, accompanying at cafés, laboring as a copyist. By mere\r\nchance, Gabriel Pierné discovered in 1912 an orchestral work, the first\r\npart _Thebes_, a symphonic poem founded on Théophile Gautier's _Roman\r\nde la Mome_, composed 1883-87. The music was found to have anticipated\r\nmany harmonic effects of a later idiom including a fairly developed\r\nwhole-tone system. Other works like the _Impressions Pastorales_\r\n(1890), some _Humoresques_ and a quintet for strings entitled _L'Ane_\r\nshow their composer to have poetic and descriptive gifts, whose late\r\nrevelation is not without pathos. Fanelli can exert no historical\r\ninfluence, but he remains an isolated and belated phenomenon whose\r\ntemporary vogue is doubtless likely soon to suffer eclipse.\r\n\r\nErik Satie, whose name has been mentioned in connection with Maurice\r\nRavel, and who doubtless was not unsympathetic to Debussy since he\r\norchestrated two of his _Gymnopédies_, was born in 1866 and studied\r\nfor a time at the Paris Conservatory. But an examination of his music\r\nwould prognosticate his distaste for that academic institution. He\r\nwas influenced by the pre-Raphaelites, and by the _Salon de la Rose\r\nCroix_ and by the mystical movement in literature generally. His music,\r\nchiefly for piano, wavers between an elevated and symbolic mysticism\r\nand an ironic and over-strained impressionism. Regarded for years as an\r\neccentric _poseur_ with some admixture of the charlatan, it must now\r\nbe recognized that he had glimmerings of a modern harmonic idiom and\r\nsubjective expression in some of its aspects before the generality of\r\nmodern Parisian musicians. But these qualities were hampered in their\r\ndevelopment by the ultra-fantastic character of his ideas, and an\r\nincapacity for a coherent development of them. He abhors the tyranny of\r\nthe barline, and many of his pieces have no rhythmical indication from\r\none end to the other, beyond the relative value of the notes. He is\r\nalso loath to employ cadences, a prophetic glimpse of the future.\r\n\r\nAmong his earlier works, the _Sarabandes_ (1887), _Gymnopédies_ (1888),\r\nincidental music for a drama by Sar Peladan, _Le Fils des Étoiles_\r\n(1891), _Sonneries de la Rose Croix_ (1892), _Uspud_, a 'Christian\r\nballet' with one character (1892), _Pièces froides_ (1897) and\r\n_Morceaux en forme de poire_ (1903), by their titles alone indicate\r\nthe character of their musical substance. The _Gymnopédies_ and\r\nthe _Sonneries de la Rose Croix_ are interesting for their absence\r\nof the commonplace and for suggestions of a poetic vein. The later\r\nworks dating from 1912 and 1913 have fantastic titles which awake the\r\ncuriosity only to disappoint it by the contents of the music. _Aperçus\r\ndésagréable_, _Descriptions automatiques_, _Chapitres tournés en tous\r\nsens_ seem deliberately contrived to affront the unwary, and cannot lay\r\nclaim to any influence beyond their perverse humor, and occassional\r\nironic caricature as in _Celle qui parle trop_, _Danse maigre_ and\r\n_Españana_.\r\n\r\nAmong the many contributors toward the upbuilding of modern French\r\nmusic one must recall the names of Gabriel Pierné for his piano\r\nconcerto, a symphonic poem for chorus and orchestra, _L'An mil_, the\r\noperas _Vendée_, _La Fille de Tabarin_ (1900), the choral works _La\r\nCroisade des Enfants_ (1903) and _Les Enfants de Bethlehem_ (1907);\r\nDeodat de Sévérac for his piano suites _Le Chant de la Terre_ (1900)\r\nand _En Languedoc_ (1904), the operas _Cœur du Moulin_ (1909) and\r\n_Heliogabale_ (1910); Gustave Samazeuilh for his string quartet, a\r\nsonata for violin and piano, the orchestral pieces _Étude Symphonique\r\nd'après 'la Nef'_ and _Le Sommeil de Canope_; Isaac Albéniz, although\r\nof Spanish birth associated with French composers;[70] Roger-Ducasse\r\nfor orchestral works, a 'mimodrame' Orphée, Louis Aubert for a Fantasie\r\nfor piano and orchestra, songs, a _Suite brêve_ for orchestra and the\r\nopera _La Forêt bleue_. In addition the names of Chevillard, Busser,\r\nLadmirault, Henri Rabaud, André Messager,[71] Labey, Casella, and\r\nothers might be added. A figure of some solitary distinction is Alberic\r\nMagnard (died 1914), whose operas _Yolande_, _Guercœur_ and _Bérénice_,\r\nthree symphonies and other orchestral works, chamber music, piano\r\npieces and songs, show him to be a serious musician who disdained\r\npopularity. Associated with the Schola he partook of d'Indy's artistic\r\nstimulus without losing his own individuality.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo composers whose achievements are the strongest of the younger\r\ngeneration are Albert Roussel and Florent Schmitt. The former, born\r\nin 1869, entered the navy, and even visited Cochin-China. In 1898 he\r\nentered the Schola, where he studied with d'Indy for nine years. Since\r\n1902 he has taught counterpoint at the Schola. His principal works\r\nare the piano pieces _Rustiques_ (1904-6), a _Suite_ (1909), a Trio\r\n(1902), a _Divertissement_ for wind instruments (1906), a Sonata for\r\npiano and violin (1907-08), the orchestral works 'A Prelude,' after\r\nTolstoy's novel 'Resurrection' (1903), _Le poëme de la Forêt_, a\r\nsymphony (1904-6) and three symphonic sketches, 'Evolutions' (1910-11),\r\nthe last with chorus, a ballet-pantomine, _Le Festin de l'Araignée_\r\n(1913). Of these the best known are the orchestral works and the\r\nballet. If the symphony suggests many traits of d'Indy, there is in it\r\nno lack of individual ideas and treatment. The 'Evolutions' seem far\r\nmore personal, and in both style and contents convince that Roussel is\r\na genuine creative force. The ballet, 'The Festival of the Spider,'\r\nis an ingenious dramatic conception in which the characters are the\r\nspider, flies, beetles and worms. The music in its delicate subtlety\r\nis ingeniously adapted to the action, and in addition is picturesquely\r\norchestrated with a minimum of resource. Roussel has undergone a long\r\nand severe apprenticeship and his later achievements have proved its\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\nFlorent Schmitt, born 1870, is of Lorraine origin. After some\r\npreliminary study, he entered the Paris Conservatory in 1889. Dubois\r\nand Lavignac were his first teachers; subsequently he joined the\r\nclasses of Massenet and Gabriel Fauré. Leaving the Conservatory to\r\nundergo his military service, he obtained a second _prix de Rome_\r\nin 1897. In 1900 he was awarded the first prize with the cantata\r\n_Semiramis_. After his prescribed stay at the Villa Medicis in Rome,\r\nSchmitt travelled to Germany, Austria and Hungary and even Turkey.\r\n\r\nSchmitt has been a prolific composer and space will not permit a\r\nconsideration of all his works. Those upon which his rising reputation\r\nrests are a _Quintette_ for piano and strings (1905-08), the 47th Psalm\r\nfor solo, chorus, orchestra and organ (1904) and two symphonic poems,\r\n_Le Palais hanté_ after Poe, and _La Tragédie de Salomé_ (1907), in its\r\noriginal form danced as a _drame muet_ by Loie Fuller. In addition are\r\nmany piano pieces for two and four hands, and for two pianos, songs and\r\nchoruses.\r\n\r\nIn Florent Schmitt's music is to be found alike the solid contrapuntal\r\nworkmanship of the Conservatory and the atmospheric procedures\r\nof Debussy. These are combined with a striking homogeneity and a\r\ndominating force that make Schmitt perhaps the most promising figure\r\namong French younger musicians of to-day. If this praise must be\r\nqualified, it must be acknowledged that he is overfluent, and that the\r\ntriviality of many of his ideas is only saved by his extraordinary\r\nskill in treating them. In this respect his resourcefulness is\r\nsurprising and well-nigh infallible. The massive architectural quality\r\nof the quintet, the barbaric splendor of the 47th Psalm,[72] and\r\nthe passionate and sinister mood of _La Tragédie de Salomé_ make\r\nthese works significant of the future even in the face of previous\r\nachievements by his older contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIf this survey of modern French composers seem oversanguine in its\r\nassertions, even the most conservative critic must admit that their\r\nwork within the last thirty years has possessed a singularly unified\r\ncontinuity. Striving deliberately to attain racial independence, the\r\nvarious composers have attained their end with a unity of achievement\r\nwhich is not surpassed in modern times. Whether following the counsel\r\nof the naturalized Franck, or heeding the iconoclastic tendencies of\r\nChabrier, Fauré and Debussy, and the realistic aspirations of Bruneau\r\nand Charpentier, the impressions of Ravel with its added graphic\r\ntouches of realism, French music has had a distinctive style, a\r\npersonal explanation of mood and a racial individuality such as it has\r\nnot shown since the days of Rameau. The question as to its durability\r\nmay be raised, as has been done in many epochs and countries, but its\r\nposition in the immediate past, and in certain aspects of the present,\r\nleaves no doubt as to its conviction and its import.\r\n\r\n                                                          E.

Almost an\r\naxiom has this popular notion become among such persons. And there\r\nis, indeed, little purpose in discouraging the belief. For what is to\r\nbe gained by destroying an illusion which, in actual working, does no\r\nharm? Italy's musical development and that, for example, of Germany,\r\nare diametrically opposed to each other. Yet they both stand to-day\r\nfor something particular and peculiar to their own natures. Man in\r\nhis evolution has subconsciously wrought certain changes, certain\r\ninnovations; he has been guided in doing so not so much by his desires\r\nas by his national characteristics.\r\n\r\nTaking this into consideration there is nothing that cannot be\r\nunderstood in Italy's musical line from Palestrina to Montemezzi.\r\nPerhaps the road has been travelled with fewer halts with a view to an\r\nideal than has that of other nations, but it has been in accordance\r\nwith those things which not only shape a nation's fate but also\r\nits art. The Italian race, descended as it is from the Roman, had\r\ntraditions. The ideals of that group of men known as the Florentine\r\nmonodists were high. It was their purpose to add such music to the\r\nspoken word as would intensify its meaning and make its effect upon\r\nan audience more pronounced. In short, as far back as 1600, when these\r\nmen flourished, the ambition of Richard Wagner and the music drama, or,\r\nif you prefer, the Greek tragedy of Sophokles and Æschylus, was known\r\nby Italian musicians who in their composing tried to establish a union\r\nbetween text and music such as the master of Bayreuth only accomplished\r\nlate in the nineteenth century. With the beginnings of oratorio and\r\nopera--they differed little at first--the idea that personal success\r\nfor the performer was necessary crept in. Had it not, Richard Wagner\r\nwould not have been obliged to revolutionize the form of production\r\ngiven on the lyric stage. Händel, a German by birth and an Englishman\r\nby adoption, wrote florid Italian opera after 1700; he sacrificed the\r\nsignificance of the word to the effectiveness of his vocal writing and\r\nproduced some things thereby which we of to-day can look upon only as\r\nludicrous. The musical world knows how opera was composed in Italy in\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The librettist was not a poet, but a poetaster; a composer\r\nof eminence would call upon him to supply words for an aria already\r\ncomposed and especially adapted to the voice of some great and popular\r\nsinger. The result naturally was an art-form which was neither sincere\r\nnor of real value, except from the standpoint of the singer.\r\n\r\nThe early Verdi followed the form which was known to him by attending\r\nthe performances of opera given in his youth in Italy. But he saw\r\nthe error of his ways and his masterpieces, _Aida_, _Otello_ and\r\n_Falstaff_, more than atone for his early operas, which have little\r\nmerit other than their facile melodic flow. Was it not to be expected\r\nthat after him would come men who would emulate the manner of his\r\nlast works? Was it unnatural to believe that Italy would interest\r\nitself in a more faithful setting of words to music? And the direct\r\nfollowers of the composer of _Otello_ gave forth something that called\r\nthe world's attention to their works. That it maintained Italian opera\r\nat a plane equal to the three final works of Verdi cannot be said. It\r\nwas a passing phase and opened the way for the men who are now raising\r\nItalian operatic composition to the highest point in its history. As\r\nsuch it served its purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen Giuseppe Verdi died in 1901 there had already been inaugurated the\r\nRealist movement in Italian opera. Italy's 'grand old man' had seen\r\nPietro Mascagni achieve world renown with his _Cavalleria Rusticana_\r\nand Ruggiero Leoncavallo follow him with the popular _I Pagliacci_.\r\nWhat he thought of the 'Veritists' we are not favored with knowing. It\r\nwould seem safe to say that he could not have been deeply impressed by\r\nthem; for the soul which gave musical expression to the emotions of\r\nthe dying lovers Radames and Aïda, to the grief-stricken Otello after\r\nhis murder of the lovely Desdemona, could have had little sympathy\r\nwith the productions of men who fairly grovelled in the dust and\r\ncovered themselves with mire in their attempts to picture the primitive\r\nfeelings of Sicilian peasantry.\r\n\r\nOne man who is still alive and whose best work has a place in the\r\n_répertoire_ of more than one opera house was a valued friend of Verdi.\r\nArrigo Boïto[73] is his name. It was he who prepared for Verdi the\r\n_libretti_ of _Otello_ and _Falstaff_ and produced a highly creditable\r\nscore himself in his _Mefistofele_. Time was when this modern Italian's\r\nversion of the Faust story was looked upon by _cognoscenti_ as music of\r\nmodern trend. In 1895 R. A. Streatfeild, the English critic, spoke of\r\nit as 'music of the head, rather than of the heart.' Hear it to-day\r\nand you will wonder how he made such a statement, for we have gone far\r\nsince _Mefistofele_ and to us it sounds pretty much like 'old Italian\r\nopera' in the accepted sense. But in its day it had potency. Boïto is,\r\nhowever, a finer _littérateur_ than he is a musician. Since his success\r\nwith _Mefistofele_ he has not given us anything else. He has, to be\r\nsure, been working for many years on a _Nero_ opera, the second act of\r\nwhich--there are to be five--is now completed. But a few years ago he\r\ndonned the senatorial toga and matters of state have so occupied his\r\nattention that he is permitted now to turn his thoughts to music only\r\nat intervals. Further, he is already a man well along in years and\r\nthe impulse to create is no longer strong. Those who know Boïto have\r\nreported that he will not complete _Nero_ and that it will go down as a\r\nfragment.\r\n\r\nAlberto Franchetti, born in 1860 in Turin, has composed _Asrael_,\r\n_Cristoforo Colombo_ and _Germania_, three long, unimportant works,\r\ntried and found wanting. It was Luigi Torchi, the distinguished Italian\r\ncritic, who, in discussing _Asrael_ called it 'the most fantastic,\r\nmetaphysical humbug that was ever seen on the stage.' (Torchi wrote\r\nthis before Charpentier compelled himself to complete his 'Louise'!)\r\nFranchetti's leaning is toward the historical opera _à la Meyerbeer_,\r\nhis method is Wagnerian. Originality he has none.\r\n\r\nOur Realists are before us: Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Giordano, Puccini\r\nand Wolf-Ferrari. We have purposely omitted the names of men like\r\nSmareglia, Cilea, Tasca and Spinelli. Their music has long since\r\nbeen relegated to oblivion even in their own land. Little of it ever\r\ngot beyond the Italian boundary. Spinelli's _A Basso Porto_ reached\r\nNew York in 1900 and was thus described by Mr. W. J. Henderson,\r\nmusic critic of the New York _Sun_: 'The story is so repulsive, the\r\npersonages so repellent, the motives so atrocious and the whole\r\natmosphere of the thing so foul with the smell of the scums and stews\r\nof life, that one is glad to escape to the outer air.... As to the\r\nmusic, ... there is not a measure of it which proclaims inspiration.\r\nThere is not an idea which carries with it conviction.' Mr. Henderson\r\ndoes not even condemn our American operas so ruthlessly! From all of\r\nwhich the nature of Spinelli's opera may be understood.\r\n\r\nWe in America have for a number of years looked upon Giacomo Puccini\r\nas the greatest of living Italian opera composers. His devotees call\r\nhim the greatest living creator of operatic music. Already his position\r\nis becoming insecure, for younger, more inspired and more learned men\r\nare appearing on the horizon of Italy's music. The Italians have never\r\nheld Puccini in the same esteem as have Americans. Despite his many\r\nfailures Pietro Mascagni has been the pride of Italian musicians and\r\nmusic-lovers. They will grant you that his _L'Amico Fritz_, _Guglielmo\r\nRatcliff_ and _Iris_ have failed somewhat ignominiously. They will\r\nadmit that the story of _Iris_ is one of the most revolting subjects\r\never chosen for treatment upon the stage. Yet you will have difficulty\r\nin proving to the contrary when they challenge you to find them a more\r\npowerful piece of orchestral writing by an Italian up to 1910 than the\r\n'Hymn to the Sun' from that opera. We know of nothing in modern Italian\r\nmusic so moving as this marvellously conceived prelude, a piece of\r\nimaginative writing of the first rank.\r\n\r\nMascagni[74] found himself famous after his _Cavalleria_. The youthful\r\nvigor of that music, crude and immature, gripped his countrymen and\r\nthe inhabitants of other lands and made them believe that a new voice\r\nhad appeared whose musical message was to be noteworthy. Here was a\r\ncomposer who had the training, who possessed definite musical ideas,\r\nwho understood the stage--by far the most important thing for a\r\ncomposer of opera--but who has failed to add one iota to his reputation\r\nthough he has worked laboriously since the early nineties to do so.\r\nHis _Ysabeau_, which we were promised a few years ago, has achieved\r\nperhaps more success in his native land than any of his operas since\r\n_Cavalleria_; some call it a masterpiece, others decry its style as\r\nbeing unnatural to its composer. A hearing in America would do much to\r\nclarify the situation. Unfortunately Mascagni is a man who has disputes\r\nwith publishers, who disappoints impresarios who desire to produce his\r\nworks and whose domestic relations rise to turbulent climaxes from\r\ntime to time. This has played a large part in his failure to receive\r\nhearings. And it is indeed lamentable to think that his chances for\r\nsuccess have been spoiled by such matters.\r\n\r\nHis musical style is realistic, but it is never extreme. It was\r\n_Cavalleria_ and the success gained by it that gave men like Tasca and\r\nSpinelli the idea that they, by carrying _verismo_ further, would be\r\nreceived as composers of note. Mascagni has melodic fluency, he writes\r\nwell for the voice and his management of the orchestra in _Iris_ is\r\nproof positive that he has learned how to avoid that ill-balance of\r\ninstrumental departments which occurs constantly in _Cavalleria_.\r\n\r\nA smaller spirit is Leoncavallo (b. 1858). _I Pagliacci_, to be sure,\r\nremains one of the most popular operas of the day. But that is no proof\r\nof greatness. It must be granted that in it he touched a responsive\r\nchord; that his music has warmth and emotional force. But what is there\r\nin this little tragedy that lifts one up? What is there of thematic\r\ndistinction? Signor Leoncavallo, like Mascagni, has pursued the muse\r\nand written a dozen or two operas since the world approved of his _I\r\nPagliacci_. He has written _Chatterton_, _I Medici_, _Maia_, a _La\r\nBohème_ after Murger, _I Zingari_ more recently, and he is now writing\r\nan opera called _Ave Maria_. They represent _in toto_ a vast amount of\r\nwork, but little of achievement. Those who have heard his recent operas\r\nagree unanimously that they lack the spark which _Pagliacci_ possesses,\r\nthat they are honest works by a man who has little to say and who tries\r\nto say that little in an imposing manner.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the place of Giacomo Puccini will be determined alone by\r\ntime. He is one of those creators to whom success in overwhelming\r\nmeasure comes, to whom the praise of the masses is granted during his\r\nlife-time. Signor Puccini has seen his operas made part and parcel of\r\nvirtually every operatic institution, large and small, that pretends to\r\nhave a respectably varied repertory. He has witnessed triumphs, he has\r\nthe satisfaction of knowing that such a singer as Enrico Caruso in one\r\nof his operas can fill the vast auditorium of New York's Metropolitan\r\nOpera House. His work, now almost completed, if we are to believe\r\nthose reports which are divulged as authentic, is the achievement of a\r\nsuccessful composer. His early operas _Edgar_ and _Le Villi_ are not in\r\nthe reckoning. Let us pass them by. But he has given us a _La Bohème_,\r\n_Manon Lescaut_, _Madama Butterfly_ and _La Fanciulla del West_. All\r\nof them have been accepted, though there may be some dispute as to the\r\nplace of the last named. Puccini is now fifty-seven years old. He was\r\nborn in 1858 at Lucca. He has enjoyed worldly possessions as the result\r\nof having written music; he is the idol of the public. Has he won the\r\nrespect of discerning musicians? Has his music been accorded a place\r\nalongside that of the great living masters, such as Richard Strauss,\r\nJean Sibelius and Claude Debussy?\r\n\r\nSuch a problem presents itself in the case of this popular composer\r\nfor the stage. We would not deny Puccini a claim to respect; he\r\ndeserves that, if for no other reason than for his having achieved\r\ninternational approval. But when one comes to a wholly serious\r\ninvestigation one fears that he will not be among the elect of his\r\ntime. And there is this to be considered in arriving at an evaluation\r\nof his achievement. He has written music in every case to stories\r\nthat the world has taken to its heart, witness _Manon_, _La Bohème_,\r\n_Butterfly_, _Tosca_ and 'The Girl.' It mattered little to him whether\r\nthey were dramas or novels. He waited until the public had judged and\r\nthen set himself to putting them into operatic form. Such a procedure\r\nis, of course, any composer's right. And it shows keen insight of,\r\nhowever, a very obvious kind. If the story of one's opera is already\r\npopular and admired by the world, half the battle for approval is\r\nalready won. The big men were often less wise. Weber wrote music to\r\nstories that were not only unknown, but that had no especial appeal;\r\nand he wrote his inspired music to _libretti_ that were shamefully\r\nconstructed and amateurishly written.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Modern Italian Composers:]\r\n\r\n            Giacomo Puccini     Riccardo Zandonai\r\n          Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari   Pietro Mascagni\r\n\r\nMen of the first rank, who are artists in everything they do, do not\r\nchoose their subjects in the way Puccini has. For Wagner the writing\r\nof a _Tristan und Isolde_ was life--it was as necessary that he work\r\non that particular drama as that he breathe. And to deal with the\r\n'Parsifal' legend when he did was likewise inevitable. Call 'Parsifal'\r\nart or twaddle--it matters little which--you must admit that it\r\nreflects the master in his almost senile period, interested in just\r\nsuch an absurd conglomeration as Kundry, Amfortas, Klingsor and its\r\nother dramatic materials compose. The greatest composers of opera have\r\nwritten because they had to express certain things and because they\r\nfound a drama which dealt with it. Puccini has been led by what the\r\nworld approved.\r\n\r\nPuccini has been fortunate, indeed. His _La Bohème_ is artistically\r\nhis best work. In it there is a finer sense of balance and proportion\r\nthan in anything that he has done. He has done what few Italians are\r\nable to do, namely, he has interpreted the French spirit. This little\r\nopera--whose libretto, effective as it is, is in no wise an adequate\r\nreduction of Murger's great novel--is replete with comic and tragic\r\nmoments that amuse and thrill by turns. The fun-making of the jolly\r\nBohemians, Rodolphe, Marcel, Schaunard and Colline, is capitally\r\npictured in music that is as care-free as the souls of the inhabitants\r\nof the _Quartier Latin_. And the death of little Mimi makes a musical\r\nscene that has potency to-day,--yes, even though Puccini has since\r\nlearned to handle his orchestral apparatus with a firmer grip and a\r\nmightier sweep.\r\n\r\n_La Fanciulla del West_, which had its world-première in America in\r\n1911, is Puccini's biggest, if not his best, production. We care not\r\na farthing whether his music be typical of California in 1849--we do\r\nwish that the carpers who claim that it is not, would enlighten us by\r\ntelling just what kind of music _is_ typical of it--nor does it matter\r\nwhether one hear echoes of his earlier operas in it. It suffices that\r\nin it he has written with a sweep and a command of his forces such\r\nas he exhibits nowhere else and that he has written gorgeously in\r\nmore than one scene in the work. We have heard that there is not as\r\nmuch melody in it as in his other operas. But, as a matter of fact,\r\nPuccini's melodies in 'The Girl' are quite as good as those in his\r\nother operas. What is more, they have a pungency which he has attained\r\nnowhere else.\r\n\r\nBut we fear that it is music of our time and that only. We cannot\r\nbring ourselves to believe that audiences of 1975 will find in Puccini\r\nanything that will interest them. Works that depend, to a large extent,\r\non the appearance of a certain singer in the cast--and Puccini's operas\r\ndo--will scarcely exert a hold on the public of a day when those\r\nsingers shall have passed from this world. Antonio Scotti has made\r\nScarpia in _Tosca_ so vital a histrionic figure, Mr. Caruso sings\r\nCavaradossi so beautifully that only the most _blasé_ opera-goer fails\r\nto get real enjoyment from their personations. And so it is to a large\r\ndegree with his other operas. Puccini bids fair to become another\r\nMeyerbeer when fifty years shall have rolled away. He has enjoyed the\r\nsame shouts of approval from a public no more discerning than was that\r\nof Paris of the early nineteenth century; he has been called the most\r\npopular operatic composer of his day. Meyerbeer was, too. Yet to-day\r\nwe can only find him tiresome and boring; we can but wonder how any\r\npublic listened to his banalities, his deadly fustian, his woeful lack\r\nof inspiration, and express approval. Already the music of the future\r\nis dawning on our horizon. Those of us who have given it attention\r\nknow that it is a very different thing from what music has been in the\r\npast. What we know of it now may only be a shadow of what is to come.\r\nWill it, when it does come and has been accepted, allow a place to the\r\nlong-drawn phrases of Giacomo Puccini?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nErmanno Wolf-Ferrari, born (1876) of a German mother and an Italian\r\nfather, presents a problem to us. He is a man whose gifts have not\r\nat all times been applied to that which was his ideal, but rather to\r\nthe immediately necessary. If one looks at him in this light--and it\r\nis feasible to do so--one can readily understand some of his artistic\r\nindiscretions. The mob knows him as the composer of _I Gioielli della\r\nMadonna_ ('Jewels of the Madonna,' 1908), his only essay in operatic\r\nrealism of the objectionable type. The art-lover hails him as the\r\nfine spirit that conceived the little operas _Il Segreto di Suzanna_,\r\n_Le Donne Curiose_, _L'Amore Medico_, the oratorio _La Vita Nuova_,\r\nsome charming though not important songs and several beautiful pieces\r\nof chamber music, among them two sonatas for violin and piano and a\r\nquintet for piano and strings.\r\n\r\nWolf-Ferrari is neither Italian nor German; he is a mixture and so it\r\nis possible to conceive his thinking music in two ways.[75] By no means\r\nis this desirable, but when it exists, what force can alter it? We\r\nfeel that the 'Jewels of the Madonna'--which those for whom music is\r\nan entertainment rather than an art admire so much--is simply a 'bad\r\ndream' of its composer's. Before one knows his instrumental music one\r\nthinks it was the real Wolf-Ferrari and that the _finesse_ of his other\r\noperas was a pose. There are many things which caused the 'Jewels' to\r\nbe written; persons who know the composer and who were in Munich when\r\nit was being written say that the chief one was the need of financial\r\naid. Seeing the shekels pouring into the baskets of composers who did\r\nthis kind of thing regularly, Wolf-Ferrari 'tried his hand,' thinking\r\nthat it would be lucrative. That part of the adventure has not been\r\ndenied him. But it has done him immeasurable harm in the opinions\r\nof many who were looking to him for greater things. Its chances are\r\nlimited--it cannot be sung in Italy on account of its misrepresentation\r\nof Neapolitan life--and the Metropolitan Opera House has refused to\r\nplace it in the _répertoire_.\r\n\r\nWhat Wolf-Ferrari will do no one can say. His next production may be in\r\nhis dainty and at all times charming manner. It may quite as readily be\r\na lurid and vulgar thing in the coarse musical style of 'The Jewels.'\r\nOne can only hope that the widely expressed regrets of _cognoscenti_\r\non the appearance of this unsavory and uninspired work will have their\r\neffect on the composer and that he will give us more in his _rococo_\r\nstyle, which if not original is at any rate delightful and unique in\r\nthe music of to-day.\r\n\r\nTimes change and music develops. There is, in fact, no branch of art\r\nin which metamorphoses are so quickly accomplished. Not a decade ago\r\nLuigi Torchi wrote that Umberto Giordano (b. 1867) was an ultra-modern\r\ncomposer! This from a man whose knowledge and fairness must be viewed\r\nwith respect. Giordano an ultra-modern! One hesitates to answer such\r\na fatuous assertion. Were it not generally known that what is new in\r\nmusic to-day is _rococo_ to-morrow the case might be a serious one.\r\nUmberto Giordano is inconsequential in the evaluating of Italian\r\nmusic-drama. His achievements are the operas _Regina Diaz_, _Mala\r\nVita_, _Andrea Chénier_, _Fedora_, _Siberia_ and _Mme. Sans-Gêne_.\r\nFor the opera-goer of to-day the list has little meaning. _Regina\r\nDiaz_, an early work, occupies a place in that limbo of the past\r\nwhere Puccini's _Le Villi_ has long been slumbering. _Mala Vita_ was\r\na failure, _Andrea Chénier_ and _Fedora_ mild successes. 'Siberia'\r\nhad meritorious features, notably the Russian folk-songs which were\r\nemployed _verbatim_; had Signor Giordano been a musician who had the\r\npower to develop them symphonically and thus make them part and parcel\r\nof his score his opera might have taken a place in the repertory of\r\nthe world's opera-houses. _Fedora_, based on that wretched example\r\nof Sardoodledom, was quickly consigned to oblivion and now his\r\nlong-awaited _Madame Sans-Gêne_--which he has been thinking about since\r\nthe time he went to Giuseppe Verdi and asked him whether it would be\r\npossible to write an opera in which Napoleon had to sing--has failed\r\nto establish him an iota more firmly in the estimation of musicians\r\nand lovers of music-drama. Many years have been required for the\r\ncomposition of _Sans-Gêne_; Giordano, once looked to as one of the\r\n'younger Italians,' is no longer to be placed in that category. He is\r\nnearly fifty and he writes slowly. From him little is to be expected.\r\nHe remains one of those lesser composers, whose name was brought\r\ninto prominence by his _Andrea Chénier_ at a time when the interest\r\nin Italy's then younger men had been aroused through the unequivocal\r\nsuccess of _Cavalleria_ and _I Pagliacci_.\r\n\r\nGiacomo Orefice and Luigi Mancinelli are two men whose activities as\r\ncomposers have resulted in several operas that have had hearings.\r\nOrefice has done the operas _Mariska_, _Consuelo_, _Il Gladiatore_,\r\n_Chopin_, _Cecilia_, _Mose_, and _Il Pane Altri_. His _Chopin_ seems\r\nto have aroused the most comment; in it he pictured incidents in\r\nthe life of the great Polish piano composer and in doing so he has\r\nemployed Chopin's music, setting some of the nocturnes as solos for the\r\nvoice, etc. He is, however, more of a musical scholar than a composer.\r\nMancinelli, who has divided his time between conducting and composing,\r\nhas done a 'Hero and Leander,' which had a respectable success when\r\nfirst heard. His other operas are _Isora di Provenza_ and _Paolo e\r\nFrancesca_. He has also done two oratorios, _Isaia_ and _San Agnese_.\r\nHis musical speech is frankly that of a post-Wagnerian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Italian music-drama there are two young men living\r\nto-day who have achieved art-works which seem to be the creation of\r\nindividual thought. Riccardo Zandonai and Italo Montemezzi must carry\r\nthe banner of their land in the music-drama. The world has not taken\r\nthem into that much cherished household-word condition, but one does\r\nnote their attracting attention among musicians. And this is the first\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nMontemezzi is one of those composers who was absolutely unknown outside\r\nof his own country until _L'Amore dei tre re_ was heard in New York in\r\n1914. With little heralding the Metropolitan Opera House produced his\r\nwork; there were rumors of certain influences being responsible for its\r\nbeing done. Many shook their heads at its chances of being accepted\r\nby the public. The final rehearsals were not completed when it was\r\nrecognized by a few gentlemen of the press that here was a new composer\r\nwho, though he had nothing wholly original to say, was a man who could\r\nspeak his lines with distinction. The _première_ came and the little\r\nopera was acclaimed. It was at once seen that Signor Montemezzi was\r\na man who harked back to the poetic drama as a basis for his musical\r\nstructure, that he had no patience with the veritists in opera. He had,\r\nas it were, a finer soul, a loftier spiritual outlook than the rank\r\nand file of his countrymen who had tried to win in the field of opera\r\nwithin the last fifteen years.\r\n\r\nItalo Montemezzi was born in 1876. His works, all operatic, are:\r\n_Giovanni Gallurese_, produced in Turin at the Victor Emmanuel Theatre\r\non January 28, 1905, _Hellera_, at Turin at the Regio Theatre on March\r\n17, 1909, and _L'Amore dei tre re_, in Milan at La Scala in the winter\r\nof 1913. It is rather strange to note in this composer a total freedom\r\nfrom the long-drawn phrase made so popular by Mr. Puccini. Montemezzi\r\nseems to abhor it; and it is to his credit that he can work without\r\nit. His earlier operas were less refined, but to-day it is always\r\npossible to recognize his restraint in working up his climaxes and his\r\nmastery in the highly imaginative orchestral score which he sets down.\r\nNothing that modern orchestration includes is unknown to him, but he\r\nis sparing in his use of the instruments: he avoids monotonous stopped\r\nbrass effects--which modern composers dote on to the distress of their\r\nlisteners--he speaks a poetic utterance like a man in whom there is\r\nthat spark that bids him contribute to the art-work of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut with all his talent he does not possess genius. The man in Italy\r\nwho has that is Riccardo Zandonai, whose place is at the head of\r\nthe leaders in his country's music. Signor Zandonai is in truth\r\nyoung. He is but thirty-two to-day (1915), and he has already done an\r\nunquestionably important work. When you know the music of this man you\r\nwill realize that Italy's place in the music of the future is to be a\r\nglorious one. For his followers will be path-breakers like himself.\r\nAlready one has appeared on the horizon. Of him we shall speak later.\r\nTo Dickens and his 'Cricket on the Hearth,' which the Latins call _Il\r\nGrillo del Focolare_, Zandonai first gave his attention. This opera was\r\nfirst given at the Politeama Chiarella in Turin on November 28, 1908,\r\nfollowed by his _Conchita_ at the Dal Verme in Milan on November 13,\r\n1912. We pause here to speak of this opera, which though received with\r\nan ovation at its every premier performance, barring New York, does not\r\nseem to have held its place in the _répertoire_. The libretto, which is\r\nafter Pierre Louys's _La Femme et le Pantin_, is not one that interests\r\nthe public. _Conchita_ was given, as we said, in Milan, then in London\r\nat Covent Garden, then in San Francisco by a visiting company which\r\ncame over to give a season of opera; Cleofonte Campanini produced it in\r\nChicago and Philadelphia and then brought it to New York for one of the\r\nguest performances in February, 1913. No further performances in New\r\nYork were planned. To pass judgment on it from that performance--which\r\nis what actually happened in the case of the newspaper reviewers--was\r\nidle. Only Tarquinia Tarquini, the young Italian mezzo-soprano, for\r\nwhom the composer wrote the rôle, was adequate. The tenor who sang\r\nwas already losing his best qualities, and the other parts were only\r\nmoderately well done. The chorus was fair and the orchestra likewise.\r\nMr. Campanini labored to put spirit into the performance, but it seemed\r\nthat the score was a little too subtle for his rather obvious powers of\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nOne New York critic agreed with the present writer that in spite of the\r\nperformance _Conchita_ was the most interesting novelty that had been\r\nbrought out since _Pelléas_. Since then everything that this composer\r\nhas done has been watched with the greatest interest. _Conchita_ was\r\naccused of lacking melody, of being 'patchy,' of being overscored\r\nin spots. None of these things are true when one knows the work. A\r\nweek's study of the score reveals among the most gorgeous moments\r\nthat modern Italy has given us, moments which cannot fail to impress\r\nany fair-minded person with their composer's genius. Zandonai is an\r\nultra-modern and he writes without making any concessions to his\r\nforces. _Conchita_ may not be a work that fifty years hence will know,\r\nbut it is far too good an achievement to be allowed to lie on the shelf\r\nin these days of semi-sterility in operatic composition.\r\n\r\nTo Zandonai's list of operas we must add _Melenis_, which first saw\r\nthe light at the Dal Verme in Milan on November 13, 1912. It was not\r\nsuccessful. Then did Zandonai set himself his greatest task, for he\r\nbegan _Francesca da Rimini_, using as his libretto a reduction of\r\nd'Annunzio's superb drama, the work of Tito Ricordi, the noted Italian\r\npublisher. It was done at the Scala in Milan in the spring of 1914\r\nand was a triumph. The following summer brought it to Covent Garden,\r\nLondon, where its success was again instantaneous. The Boston Opera\r\nCompany had planned to give it in the winter of 1913-1914, but the\r\nillness of Lina Cavalieri postponed it. Then Mr. Gatti-Casazza was\r\nrumored to have taken it for the Metropolitan Opera in New York for the\r\nseason of 1914-1915, but it has not been forthcoming.\r\n\r\nOf _Francesca_ we can only speak through an acquaintance with\r\nthe published score. We have not sat in the audience and gotten\r\nthat perspective which is, perhaps, necessary in estimating a new\r\nmusic-drama's worth. But the impressions thus gained may be recorded\r\nhere at any rate. A magnificent drama, containing everything that the\r\nmusician who would accomplish the wedding of the two arts requires, Mr.\r\nZandonai must have gotten much inspiration in working on it. And the\r\nresults are plainly there. The full, Italian rich melodic flow, which\r\nin _Conchita_ was not always present, the apt sense of illustrating the\r\ndramatic moment in tone, the masterly command of modern harmony and a\r\nvital pulsing surge are in this music. If Mr. Zandonai ever surpasses\r\nthe love-scene of Paolo and Francesca he will go down in history as a\r\ngiant. If he does not he will already at the age of thirty-two have\r\nmade a distinguished place for himself. Personally we know nothing\r\nin modern French, German or Russian music-drama that compares with\r\nthis, unless it be the great moments in Richard Strauss's _Salomé_ and\r\n_Elektra_. As for the orchestral score of _Francesca_, we have heard\r\nMr. Zandonai's orchestra, know how he employs his instruments and are\r\ncertain that in the time between _Conchita_ and this work he has, if\r\nanything, progressed. That wonderful sweep which he had at his command\r\nin the earlier opera must be present again in this newer one. Should it\r\nnot be we still feel sure that the work will win on the merits of its\r\ndistinguished thematic material.\r\n\r\nRumor has it that Zandonai is now engaged on setting Rostand's _La\r\nprincesse lointaine_. Some day he may do _Cyrano_, too, since his\r\npublishers acquired all the Rostand dramas two years ago for operatic\r\nuse. And we may rightly expect important things from him, for he is a\r\nmusician of the first rank, Italy's genius of to-day. That he is not\r\nonly a composer for the stage will be explained in the next chapter\r\nwhen we shall treat of his noteworthy art-songs and his orchestral\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe follower of Zandonai who has been mentioned though not named, is\r\nthe boy Vittore de Sabbata. We have learned that he has completed an\r\nopera which has made his publishers skeptical as to what he will do\r\nin the future. It is said to be so modern in its mode of expression,\r\nso difficult to produce, that it has not been definitely decided\r\nwhether or not it will be undertaken. The score of his Suite for\r\norchestra, written at eighteen, has made us marvel at his ingenuity\r\nand his pregnant musical ideas. What he will do is not to be gauged\r\nby any rule. He may prove to be a prodigy whose light will have been\r\nextinguished long before he is thirty. His health is reported to be\r\nvery poor and so he may be taken from us before he achieves anything\r\ndefinite. At any rate his name deserves recording, for he may be one of\r\nthose men who will figure prominently in bearing onward the legion of\r\nthe Italian music-drama of the future.\r\n\r\nVittorio Gnecchi, born in 1876, has done two operas, _Cassandra_ and\r\n_Virtù d'Amore_. _Cassandra_ was first produced in 1905 at the Teatro\r\nCommunale in Bologna and has since been heard at Ferrara in 1908, in\r\nVienna at the Volksoper in 1911 and in Philadelphia in 1914. Gnecchi's\r\ninstrumentation has been much praised, likened in fact to that of\r\nRichard Strauss. On its American production several critics found\r\nin the scoring of _Cassandra_ much that recalled that of Strauss's\r\n_Elektra_. When they were reminded of the date of production and\r\ncomposition of _Cassandra_, Gnecchi was soon vindicated from the charge\r\nof having copied the Munich composer's orchestral writing.\r\n\r\nWorthy of record are Giuseppe Bezzi (b. 1874) with his _Quo Vadis_,\r\nRenzo Bianchi (b. 1887) with his _Fausta_, Renato Brogi (b. 1873) with\r\n_Oblio_ and _La Prima Notte_, Alessandro Bustini (b. 1876) with _Maria\r\nDulcis_, Arturo Cadore (b. 1877) with _Il Natale_, Ezio Camussi (b.\r\n1883) with _La Du Barry_, Agostino Cantu (b. 1878) with _Il Poeta_,\r\nLeopoldo Cassone (b. 1878) with _Al Mulino_ and _Velda_, Roberto\r\nCatolla (b. 1871) with _La Campana di Groninga_, Giuseppe Cicognani\r\n(b. 1870) with _Il Figlio Del Mare_, Domenico Cortopassi (b. 1875)\r\nwith _Santa Poesia_, Alfredo Cuscina (b. 1881) with _Radda_, Ferruccio\r\nCusinati (b. 1873) with _Medora_ and _Tradita_, and Franco Leoni with\r\n_Ib e la Piccola Cristina_, _L'Oracolo_, _Raggio di luna_, _Rip Van\r\nWinkle_ and _Tzigana_.\r\n\r\n                                                         A.

And only because Italy, from Boccherini\r\nto Sgambati, ignored the development of music apart from that of the\r\nstage is it necessary to express wonderment at this worthy advance. A\r\ncountry that could produce a Palestrina, a Frescobaldi and a Corelli,\r\nin the days when the art of music was still in its youth, found that it\r\nwas chiefly interested in the wedding--or attempted wedding--of words\r\nand music. There were, to be sure, at all times men who wrote what\r\nthey thought symphonies of merit, men for the most part who had little\r\nto say. Some of them were unable to work with the opera-form as it\r\nexisted. Their music was, however, the kind that never gets beyond the\r\nborders of its own country, if it succeeds in passing the city in which\r\nit is first heard. The opera-composers were much too busy getting ready\r\nan aria for Signorina Batti or Signor Lodi to study the symphonic form.\r\nSo Italy went its merry way, without symphony, without chamber music,\r\nwithout the art-song, in fact without everything that belongs to the\r\nnobler kind, from the days of Boccherini, of the much venerated Luigi\r\nCherubini to the appearance in 1843 of the late Giovanni Sgambati.\r\n\r\nThat period covered, then, from 1770, when Boccherini flourished, till\r\n1850. The reasons for the exclusive interest in opera must be sought in\r\nthe conditions obtaining in Rome, Milan, Florence, Genoa, Naples and\r\nother leading cities. Opera-composers wrote music that the orchestras\r\ncould manage with little or no trouble; symphonic music, naturally\r\nmore difficult of execution, was, to begin with, beyond the ability of\r\nmost of these orchestras. In fact it is only recently that the Italian\r\norchestras have been brought to a real point of efficiency. So Italy\r\nwent on, still holding high its head as a musical nation--in its own\r\nestimation, of course. To make a name as a musician one had to compose\r\na successful opera. A fine string quartet meant nothing to the public,\r\nfor it was a public that did not know what chamber-music was. There\r\nwere, to be sure, occasional performances, but they were sporadic, and\r\nthey had no significance for the people. After all it is not strange\r\nthat this occurred. Other nations have experienced similar stages in\r\ntheir development in other arts. Italy went through it in music. To-day\r\nshe has found herself and she is rapidly doing everything in her power\r\nto atone for her shortcomings during those many years when _opera_, in\r\nthe opinion of her people, was synonymous with _music_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nGiovanni Sgambati was born in 1843. About the year 1866 he began\r\nto make his influence felt and his compositions appeared from the\r\npublishers, who, it may be of interest to note, were advised by Wagner\r\nto exploit his music. The friendship of Franz Liszt and Sgambati was\r\na very beautiful one; Liszt, in his really noble and generous way,\r\nchampioned the young Italian, saw in him a desire to do something\r\nin which Italians of even that day were not especially absorbed.\r\nSgambati did not show Liszt an opera in the Rossinian manner when\r\nthe master arrived in Rome in 1861. With serious purpose he brought\r\nhim a symphony. And Liszt, intelligent musical spirit that he was,\r\nlooked at it and recognized that here was an Italian who knew what\r\nthe symphonic form meant, who knew his orchestra, who could write\r\nwith some distinction. If one does not expect the impossible of a\r\npioneer there is always something to be found in his activity that\r\ndeserves our aid and sympathy. So Liszt encouraged the young man.\r\nSgambati labored arduously; he accomplished a great deal. In his list\r\nof works there are symphonies, two of them, there are chamber works\r\nfor strings with piano, there is a piano concerto, shorter pieces for\r\nthe piano, some for violin, many songs, a 'Requiem' and other pieces\r\nin various forms. Sgambati as an innovator is nothing; Sgambati as an\r\nItalian symphonic pioneer is important. There was work to be done and\r\nhe did it with a zeal that speaks volumes for his artistic sense. We\r\nof to-day might find his symphonies tiresome, we might consider them\r\ntoo consciously Brahmsian without the real Brahms spark, to hold our\r\nattention. But their meaning for those men who are producing vital\r\nthings in Italy to-day is undeniable. Sgambati not only gave the world\r\nhis compositions; he saw to it that for the first time the symphonic\r\nworks of the great German masters were produced in his country. And he\r\nwas among the earliest of the Italians to champion the music of Richard\r\nWagner. Such a man, a musician with the breadth to appreciate Wagner\r\nin the days when Wagner was hissed and ridiculed, must in truth have\r\npossessed the soul of an artist.\r\n\r\nWith him worked a colleague, Giuseppe Martucci. Like him, he was a\r\npianist of note as well as a composer. Martucci came a little later\r\nthan Sgambati; he was born in 1856, and he is still living to-day\r\n(1915). For him, too, there was in music something beyond an opera\r\nthat filled the theatre from floor to gallery and gave some adored\r\nsinger the opportunity to disport himself in the unmusical cadenzas\r\nand other pyrotechnical passages which composers all around him were\r\nmanufacturing so assiduously. In placing an estimate on the achievement\r\nof Martucci it is not impossible to consider him quite as important\r\na figure as Sgambati. His music, too, has traits that are typically\r\nItalian, though based on German models. His two symphonies, his piano\r\nconcerto in B-flat minor are admirable compositions, none of them\r\nheaven-storming in originality, all of them eminently praiseworthy for\r\nthe solidity of their texture, for the beauty of their design and for\r\nthe unflinching adherence to high ideals which they embody.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be expected that the two men who set the example for\r\ntheir countrymen in symphonic composition would be geniuses of the\r\nfirst rank. Had they been they would doubtless have worked along other\r\nlines. Italian symphonic composition was to be placed on a secure\r\nbasis not by path-breakers, but by path-makers. This they were. And\r\nthey were notable examples of what good such men can work. Italy is\r\nrapidly making felt her individuality in the contemporary musical world\r\nby the strides in original composition which she is taking. To those\r\ntwo pioneers, Giovanni Sgambati and Giuseppe Martucci, must go the\r\ncredit for having pointed the way to absolute music by Italians, for\r\nhaving toiled so that the men who came after them might take what they\r\nhad done and build on it individual structures. And also that their\r\nfollowers might have a public that would listen to them.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the world to-day is there more activity in musical\r\ncomposition than among the young Italians. The world at large seems\r\nto know less about them than it does, for example, about the modern\r\nFrench or Russians. This is perhaps largely the fault of the Italian\r\npublishers, who do not seem to spread their publications about in other\r\nlands as do their colleagues. Yet the sincere and eager investigator\r\ncannot go far before he finds a vast amount of engaging new Italian\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nIn the field of the symphonic orchestra we meet with Leone Sinigaglia,\r\nRiccardo Zandonai, Vittore de Sabbata, Gino Marinuzzi, Franco Alfano,\r\nLuigi Mancinelli. In the previous chapter we have dwelt on the music\r\nof Zandonai's operas. He is, however, one of those big men who have\r\nbeen moved to do absolute music as well; and he has done several fine\r\nthings for the concert-hall. Like him, the young de Sabbata, of whom\r\nwe have spoken, and the older Mancinelli, who is better known as a\r\nconductor than as a creative musician, have also contributed to the\r\nsymphonic literature. The others, barring Alfano, who has done some\r\nfour unsuccessful operas, are composers of absolute music alone.\r\n\r\nZandonai, Italy's greatest figure, has a symphonic poem, _Vere Novo_,\r\nwhich must be seriously considered. Though it is really an orchestral\r\npiece, the composer has called in the aid of a baritone solo voice\r\nin an Ode to Spring, the poem being by the distinguished Gabriele\r\nd'Annunzio. In it we find a wonderful command of orchestral effects,\r\nan intimate knowledge of the nature of the various instruments and a\r\nmasterly attention to detail. The strings are subdivided into many\r\nparts--and not in vain--and the whole work is unquestionably important.\r\nThere is also a delightful _Serenata Mediovale_ for orchestra with\r\nan important part for a solo violoncello, a composition which has\r\ndistinction and geniality at the same time. It had a performance in New\r\nYork at an all-Italian concert several years ago, but since then it has\r\nbeen unjustly allowed to languish.\r\n\r\nFranco Alfano, born in 1876, has done a Symphony in E and a 'Romantic\r\nSuite,' two compositions that have done much to make his name\r\nrespected. For those who do not believe that a real symphony has\r\ncome out of Italy of the twentieth century an examination of this\r\nscore may well be advised. It will convince even the most skeptical.\r\nAlfano's instrumentation is always good and he knows how to develop\r\nhis material. Picturesque is the suite consisting of _Notte Adriatica_\r\n(Night on the Adriatic), _Echi dell' Appennino_ (Echoes of the\r\nApennines), _Al chiostro abbandonato_ (To an Abandoned Cloister) and\r\n_Natale campane_ (Christmas Bells). These four movements are frankly\r\nprogrammatic. They are not profound, but they are engaging, and they\r\nshould be made known wherever good orchestras exist. When we think of\r\nsome of the unsatisfactory French orchestral novelties, German works of\r\nno especial distinction that have been produced recently, it would seem\r\nthe duty of conductors to seek out these Italian scores and present\r\nthem to the public.\r\n\r\nIn Leone Sinigaglia, a native of Turin--he was born in 1868--Italy has\r\na composer who has done for the folk-music of his province, if not\r\nhis country, something akin to what such nationalists as Dvořák and\r\nGrieg accomplished. _Piemonte_ is the title of a suite, his opus 36,\r\nand _Danze Piemontese_ are two dances built on Piedmontese themes.\r\nThese melodies of the people, indigenous material that has always\r\nproved a boon to gifted composers, have been treated by Sinigaglia\r\nwith rare skill. He has clothed them in an orchestral garb which sets\r\noff their virtues most favorably and their popular nature should play\r\nan interesting part in gaining for them the approval of concert\r\naudiences. His 'Rustic Dance' from the suite _Piemonte_ is thrilling,\r\nwhile in the same suite occurs _In Montibus Sanctis_, in which there\r\nis an invocation to the Virgin, serene and aloof in its inflections.\r\nThe Piedmontese dances are brilliant, racy compositions, a master's\r\ndevelopment of tunes born of the soil. In bright and gay spirit, too,\r\nis his overture _Le Baruffe Chiozzotte_ after a Goldoni comedy. This\r\nglistening little overture has already been played in America and never\r\nfails to arouse the good spirits of all who hear it.\r\n\r\nSicily comes in for musical picturing in the work of Gino Marinuzzi,\r\nborn in 1882, a composer whose name is little known. The average\r\nmusician is not aware of his existence. Yet this modest musician has\r\nproduced a symphonic poem _Sicania_ and a _Suite Siciliana_. What\r\nSinigaglia does with the folk-melodies of his native Piedmont Marinuzzi\r\naccomplishes by employing Sicilian tunes. And they are very beautiful,\r\ntoo. After all, the results obtained in working on the folk-music of\r\nany people depend on the skill of the artist who is welding them into\r\nan art-work. Composers enough have tried to make symphonic works of\r\nthe crude tunes of our Indian aborigines, but few, with the exception\r\nof Edward MacDowell in his 'Indian Suite,' have accomplished works\r\nof art by their labors. It is, then, a matter of treatment; and both\r\nSinigaglia and Marinuzzi are well equipped to express in tone their\r\nconception of folk-songs in artistic treatment, as their orchestral\r\nworks prove conclusively.\r\n\r\nThe boy de Sabbata was born in Trieste in 1892. Saladino and Orefice\r\nwere his masters at the conservatory in Milan and they taught him\r\nwell. His orchestral technique matches that of Zandonai already and\r\nit is almost impossible to imagine what he will arrive at in the\r\nfuture. His Suite in four movements, _Risveglio mattutino_ (A Morning\r\nAwakening), _Tra fronda e fronda_ ('Mid Leafy Branches), an _Idilio_\r\nand _Meriggio_ (Midday), is one of the most amazing orchestral scores\r\nwe have ever seen. It was written at the age of twenty. De Sabbata is\r\nnot a Korngold in his musical speech; he is a modern to be sure, but\r\nhe has none of the qualities which have won for the young Viennese\r\ncomposer such heated discussion. His harmonies are new, yet they do not\r\nseem to have been put down with any desire to be different. There is a\r\nvery distinct personality in this music, and in the third movement of\r\nhis suite (_Idilio_) there is some of the warmest writing that has come\r\nto our notice in a long time. This young man has imagination, strong\r\nfantasy and a keen appreciation of color. At twenty he can say more\r\nthan most composers at forty. And because he says it in his own way one\r\ncannot help thinking that the future will be very bright for him. The\r\nonly hindrance is his ill health, which is already causing those who\r\nare interested in him much concern.\r\n\r\nPietro Floridia, born in 1860, an Italian musician who lives in\r\nNew York, has written a symphony in D minor, creditable from the\r\nstandpoint of the student but uninteresting for the public. It\r\nhas had a performance in New York, where it was cordially, if not\r\nenthusiastically, received. Mr. Floridia has also done the operas\r\n_Carlotta Clepier_, _La Colonia Libera_, _Maruzza_ and _Paoletta_.\r\nOf Luigi Mancinelli's orchestral compositions the Suite _Scene\r\nVeneziane_ has been performed in London. They are interesting examples\r\nof an Italian whose idiom is post-Wagnerian in the broadest sense.\r\nAnd Alberto Franchetti, better known for his operas, has composed a\r\nsymphony which Theodore Thomas played shortly after it was composed.\r\nLike his other productions it lacks physiognomy totally.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to digress here to say a word about Signor\r\nMarinetti and his Futurist fellows. Their place is not an especially\r\nimportant one in Italy's musical scheme. Their presence does, however,\r\nmake them come in for consideration. What Signor Marinetti and\r\nhis colleagues would have music become none of us will be so rash\r\nas to endorse. Thus far he has given performances of works of his\r\nown invention, using instruments which make hideous and inartistic\r\nnoises to express his ideas. He calls them 'gurglers,' 'snorters' and\r\n'growlers.' We are not conservative in our taste; we cannot afford to\r\nbe, for we have with us the very interesting Arnold Schönberg, who\r\nis a Futurist in tendencies, though not of the Marinetti type, and\r\nLeo Ornstein, whose music is the _dernier cri_ in our development.\r\nOrnstein's music seems to have no relation with musical art of the\r\npast; he is an impressionist and writes as he feels. He refuses\r\nexplanations of his music, further than his stating that he is\r\noblivious to all that has gone before in musical composition, and\r\nwrites what his emotions tell him to, quite as he hears it before ever\r\na note is set to paper. He employs the piano, stringed instruments, the\r\nvoice, the orchestra, as the case may be. He is therefore obviously not\r\nof Signor Marinetti's tribe. There might be some interest in hearing\r\none of the latter's bombardments, but it cannot have any æsthetic\r\nvalue. It must fail as one of those wayward retrogressions which all\r\narts have experienced at some time in their history. From Marinetti we\r\nneed fear nothing. He will be forgotten long before the next decade\r\nrolls round, when his aggressive experiment in what he calls music will\r\nhave been heartily exploded as the attempt on the part of an iconoclast\r\nto fuse a passing madness with a lofty art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nItalian piano composers are few; only one of them touches the\r\nhigh-water mark. Franco da Venezia is his name and he has put to\r\nhis credit a _Konzertstück_ for piano and orchestra and some very\r\nunusual shorter pieces for pianoforte solo. The former is regarded as\r\na splendid work. Of the _morceaux_ we cannot say too much. Da Venezia\r\nis a man of strong physiognomy. He makes no compromises to win his\r\npublic, he writes no _salon_ music. Look at his 'Caravan and Prayer in\r\nthe Desert' and you will know what he can do with the keyboard of the\r\npiano! Then turn the pages of a short poem for the piano, _L'Isle des\r\nmorts_, in which there is more real feeling than in the volumes of many\r\na fashionable modern Frenchman. Fire has been struck here; nor has it\r\nbeen lighted to express some happy little thought that might please\r\namateur pianists. In this music a tone-poet speaks and his message is\r\nworth listening to. Paolo Frontini is another man who has written much\r\nfor the piano. Not important music is his like that of da Venezia, but\r\nhe has done some very agreeable pieces, musicianly in execution and\r\ncertainly worthy of acquaintance. Mario Tarenghi, Muzio Agostini and a\r\nhalf dozen others, whose names would scarcely be worth recording, have\r\ncontributed small shares. Modern Italy's piano composer is Signor da\r\nVenezia. It is to him that we must look for the Italian piano music of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nCorelli, Vivaldi, Vitali, Veracini and a host of others held the high\r\nstandard of their country in violin music in the days of the classic\r\nfoundations. We have not forgotten Corelli's _La Follia_, the sonatas\r\nof these other men, nor the superb chaconne of Vitali. These men were\r\nviolinists and their répertoire was acquired and increased by their own\r\ncompositions. Until Nicolo Paganini appeared in 1782 the Italian violin\r\nliterature was scarcely enlarged. And Paganini's music had value only\r\nas _violin music_, whereas theirs had and _has_ a place to-day both\r\nas music and as music for the violin. Now again an Italian violinist\r\nhas come forward, the musician who has established a string quartet\r\nin Rome, where he gives his concerts every year for a discriminating\r\npublic. Rosario Scalero has in a sense atoned for the woeful lack of\r\nviolin composition in his country. Scalero is not perhaps as original\r\na composer as we would like to have him; he has followed German models\r\nand has studied seriously. But his sonata in D minor for violin and\r\npiano is one of the best modern sonatas we have, and we must be\r\ngrateful that it has come to us from a land that has done little since\r\nthe seventeenth century in producing chamber music for the violin.\r\nThis sonata leans a little on Brahms, but there is in it at the same\r\ntime something of that Italian feeling which one recognizes so easily\r\nin music, whether it be for the violin, piano, orchestra or what not.\r\nScalero has also put forth revisions of some of the classical sonatas\r\nby the old Italian masters, revisions that show his erudition and\r\nartistic judgment.\r\n\r\nSome short compositions and a 'Piedmontese Rhapsody' by Sinigaglia\r\nconstitute that very interesting musician's contribution to violin\r\nmusic. They are all of them idiomatically conceived and effective\r\nin performance. The Rhapsody is made up of folk-songs of Piedmont,\r\nquite as are the orchestral dances which have been discussed. It is\r\nan exceptionally felicitous piece to perform, and with orchestral\r\naccompaniment it should soon replace such hackneyed music as\r\nSaint-Saëns's _Rondo Capriccioso_. Beyond the efforts of these two men\r\nnothing of value is being written for the violin by the modern Italians.\r\n\r\nBefore turning to the discussion of the art-song we must speak of that\r\ncurious musical personality, Don Lorenzo Perosi, born in 1872, who is\r\nthe representative of oratorio in his land to-day. Also the Italian\r\norgan composers. Perosi began his career by startling all who knew him\r\nwith his pretentious works in which he has employed Biblical narratives\r\nas the subject for long oratorios. His 'Resurrection of Lazarus' when\r\nfirst produced in Venice fixed the attention of the world upon him.\r\nIt was said that a new Palestrina had been found. All kinds of honors\r\nwere paid him. A street in his native Tortona was named after him. His\r\nservices as conductor at presentations of his oratorios were sought. We\r\ncannot do better than to quote the remarks of Luigi Torchi, who seems\r\nto have examined his productions very carefully. He says: 'After all,\r\nwhy this hurrah about Perosi? He, whose recreation in times past was\r\nto compose cathedral church hymns after the pattern of the Protestant\r\nchorales, writes at present his vulgarly vaunted oratorios. This little\r\nabbé, born with theatrical, operatic talent, and not being permitted\r\nas a priest to write operas, in fault of religious feeling gives vent\r\nby way of compensation to the fullness of his romantic and sentimental\r\nexultations. And look at the form of his compositions: a frequency\r\nof tedious recitatives with words that follow literally the text of\r\nthe Bible; little melodies, properly beginnings without endings,\r\nwithout any severe dignity of line, alternate with more or less long\r\ninstrumental pieces of lyrical character; a couple of modern church\r\nanthems, in a work drawn from the New Testament; plain-song harmonized\r\ntragically, and some attempts at operatic realism, ecclesiastical\r\nharmonies and realistic operatic style.... He follows the lead of\r\nWagner, and makes use of the _leit-motif_; soon after he delights in\r\nturning his back on him, and offers a badly made fugue on a subject\r\nthat smells of too classic times. He has a fondness for instrumental\r\nphrases of much color, but his purely orchestral numbers are puerile,\r\nand betray no knowledge of modern orchestration. He has learned to\r\ncompose pieces without ideas, fugues without developments, and, that\r\nhe might not be too badly off, orchestral intermezzos, written and\r\norchestrated with the knowledge of a schoolboy. Perosi has undertaken\r\nthe task of illustrating the life of our Saviour in twelve oratorios.\r\nIf he should keep his word, he should be pardoned.'\r\n\r\nThus this abbé-composer is disposed of. Marco Enrico Bossi, born in\r\n1861 in Brescia, has written two oratorios, 'Paradise Lost' and 'Joan\r\nof Arc,' fine, sincere works along lines that add little to what has\r\nbeen done in the field before his time. He is at least dignified and\r\nknows his craft and so, unlike Perosi, cannot be charged with being a\r\n_poseur_. He is the foremost living organ composer that Italy owns. And\r\nit is in this department of activity that he is at his best. Some will\r\nthink that he should have been mentioned with the orchestral composers.\r\nBut his orchestral works are of the Sgambati-Martucci kind, and, since\r\nhe is one of the younger men, it would be hardly proper to discuss\r\nacademic essays along with the work of those men who are blazing paths.\r\nHis chamber music, including a fine trio 'In Memoriam,' is creditable\r\nbut undistinguished. It is only in his organ music that an individual\r\nnote is found.\r\n\r\nCesare Galeotti, Oreste Ravanello, Polibio Fumagalli, Filippo Capocci,\r\nthese are names of men who have written in recent years and are writing\r\n(some of them) organ music to-day. Capocci has done several sonatas of\r\na pleasing type, as has Fumagalli, while the other two have confined\r\nthemselves to working in the smaller forms, often with much success.\r\n\r\nTwo native Italians who have made their homes in America must be\r\nmentioned here. They are Pietro Alessandro Yon and Giuseppe Ferrata.\r\nMr. Yon is a young man of unquestioned talent. He was born in Settimo\r\nin 1886 and occupies the post of organist of the Church of St. Francis\r\nXavier, New York, devoting a good portion of his time, however, to\r\ncomposition. Just as it is the duty of organists of Anglican churches\r\nto turn out an occasional _Te Deum_ or _Jubilate_, so must the Catholic\r\nchurch organist produce a Mass every now and then. Mr. Yon is one of\r\nthose who when he comes forward with a Mass gives us a musical work\r\nof distinction, not a _pièce d'occasion_. He has written a number of\r\nthem, but particularly fine is his recent Mass in A. Here the true\r\necclesiastical spirit of the Roman church is to be found; and what\r\na mastery of polyphony does this young Italian exhibit! His organ\r\ncompositions are also praiseworthy, a charming 'Christmas in Sicily'\r\nand a 'Prelude-Pastorale' (_Dies est laetitiæ_) being characteristic\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Ferrata (b. 1866) lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he\r\nteaches and composes. His list of works is a long one, including a\r\n_Messe solennelle_ for solo voices, chorus or mixed voices and organ\r\nor orchestra, a Mass in G minor for male voices and organ, numerous\r\nsongs, piano pieces, and a dozen or more violin compositions in small\r\nforms. He should be praised especially for a very fine string quartet\r\nin G major and a group of sterling organ compositions. Mr. Ferrata's\r\npath to success has not been made easier by his living in America; it\r\nhas, in a sense, taken him away from Italy and her ways and, though\r\nit has doubtless given him a freer viewpoint, he has had to struggle\r\nfor a hearing. His compositions are only now being recognized and\r\ngiven performances. He has something to say, has a fine compositional\r\ntechnique, and he is disposed to add to his style the innovations of\r\nmodern harmonic thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nDoubtless ninety-nine out of every hundred musicians and music-lovers\r\nstill believe that Italy has no art-song, that her composers are still\r\ndevoting their energies to turning out those delectable _morceaux_\r\nin ballad-style which Italian opera singers have sung in the past,\r\nand still do, to an extent, when they are called upon to take part\r\nin a concert. For these persons, whose number is a large one, it\r\nwill be surprising information that Italy is working very seriously\r\nin the field of the art-song. And the man who has achieved the most\r\nconspicuous place in this department is that young genius, Riccardo\r\nZandonai, already spoken of as a music-dramatist and as a symphonic\r\ncomposer. Whereas some of the songs which can be placed in this class\r\nby contemporary Italians still contain germs of the popular Italian\r\nsong style, Zandonai's songs are indubitably on the high plane which is\r\nuninfluenced by popular tendencies.\r\n\r\nMr. Zandonai has doubtless done a great many more songs than we in\r\nAmerica have been made familiar with. He has perhaps also written many\r\nmore than he has published, the case with most composers. Several\r\nyears ago there appeared three songs, first a setting of Verlaine's\r\n_Il pleure dans mon cœur_, then _Coucher de soleil à Kérazur_ and\r\nthird _Soror dolorosa_ to one of Catulle Mendès' finest impassioned\r\noutbursts. The effect of these songs on musicians who, at the time,\r\nhad heard no music of Zandonai was tremendous. In every measure was\r\nwritten plainly the utterance of a big personality, who commanded\r\nmodern harmonies with indisputable mastery. Whether his setting of\r\nthe lovely Verlaine poem matches or surpasses the widely known one of\r\nDebussy is of little consequence. It is not at all like it; Zandonai\r\ndoubtless was unfamiliar with the Debussy version when he wrote the\r\nsong and his _Il pleure_ has an atmosphere all its own. The Orientalism\r\nof _Coucher de soleil à Kérazur_ is unique--it gives the impression of\r\na twilight conceived through an entirely new lens. But it is in the\r\n_Soror dolorosa_ that the composer has written what would seem to be\r\none of his masterpieces. Every drop of the emotional force that Mendès\r\nhas called out in his glorious stanzas, every bit of the color, of\r\nthe warmth of the poem is reflected stunningly in this music. It is a\r\nwedding of voice and piano, achieved only by the greatest masters in\r\ntheir most notable songs.\r\n\r\nThen there appeared another set of songs, this time five in number.\r\n_Visione invernale_, _I due tarli_, _Ultima rosa_ (this one to a\r\nFoggozzaro poem), _Serenata_ and _L'Assiuolo_ are the titles. You\r\ncannot prefer one of these songs to the other if you really get their\r\nmeaning; only the last one might be said to be not so distinctive. The\r\nwonderful dirge of _Visione Invernale_, the thrilling melodic beauty\r\nof _Ultima rosa_ and the lighter _Serenata_ and the tragic narrative\r\nof _I due tarli_ ('The Two Worms') grip as do few things in modern\r\nmusic. If Mr. Zandonai has written difficult songs, that is, from the\r\nsinger's standpoint, it was not unexpected. No composer who really had\r\na message ever wrote to a singer's taste. And Mr. Zandonai never makes\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nGuido Bianchini, Enrico Morpurgo, Alfredo Brüggemann, Mario\r\nBarbieri--names assuredly strange to many a music-lover--are all men\r\nwho have contributed significantly to song literature. Morpurgo's _Una\r\nsperanza_ is typical of him at his best; Bianchini has real modern\r\ntendencies. Francesco Santoliquido is known to us through two songs,\r\n_Tristezza crepuscolare_ and _Alba di luna sul bosco_. _Tristezza\r\ncrepuscolare_ is the better of the two, a magnificent conception, a\r\nsong that is thrilling in every inflection. There is a strong Puccini\r\ntinge in Santoliquido's music, made fine, however, by more restraint\r\nthan the composer of _Tosca_ knows how to exert. Unusually well managed\r\nare the accompaniments, which are rather graphic. Mr. Santoliquido\r\nknows how to achieve a climax within a few pages as do few of his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nApart from all these men stands Vittorio Gui, a young composer and\r\nconductor, whose career has been furthered by Arturo Toscanini. Signor\r\nGui is an 'ultra' in the best sense of the word. His songs, which have\r\nnot been exploited in America at all, are enigmatic. In fact his choice\r\nof poems makes them so. He has taken Chinese poems and translated them\r\ninto Italian, poems that contain that world of Confucian philosophy\r\nwhich is still but little known. There are problems in ultra-modern\r\nharmony here which many will not be willing to solve, but which a few\r\nhave already given serious attention to and from which they have gotten\r\nmuch joy. There is distinction in these songs; a desire to experiment,\r\nperhaps, but still the feeling for new paths, new moods, and, above\r\nall, a new idiom. The attainment of that may not be so easily\r\naccomplished, but Gui is one of the men who are going prominently in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nA word about the ballad composers, Paolo Tosti, P. Mario Costa, Luigi\r\nDenza, and Enrico de Leva. Whereas their position in serious music\r\nis not one of importance, their appeal to millions entitles them\r\nto mention. Tosti is doubtless the ablest of them. His innumerable\r\n_melodie_--the characterization of his songs as such is typical\r\nof what Italians thought a song must be before they attempted the\r\nart-song--have a melodic fascination. Who has not heard his 'Good-bye'\r\nand his _L'ultime canzone_, two songs which have won a popularity truly\r\nuniversal in scope! And when 'Good-bye,' hackneyed as it is, is sung by\r\na Melba it contains an emotional thrill, theatrical as its appeal may\r\nbe, insecure as its structure is from the standpoint of the art-song.\r\nIt would be idle to enumerate Tosti's writings. His songs go into the\r\nhundreds. De Leva, Denza, and Costa are of the same creative blood;\r\nthey believe in pure melodies, none of them distinguished, set to\r\nvery indifferent Italian texts--not poems--and one and all gorgeously\r\neffective for the singer. What these men have produced has developed in\r\nItalian singers that failing, namely, the dwelling on all high notes,\r\nwhich is so objectionable. But it has also brought joy to so many\r\nItalians whose sole musical interest was singing, and their place in\r\nthe development of Italy's music cannot be overlooked. When a hundred\r\nyears have rolled around perhaps the name of Tosti will be remembered.\r\nBut it is exceedingly doubtful whether there will be Italians producing\r\na similar kind of music; for by that time Italy's music-lovers will\r\nhave repudiated this type of banal melodic song, which makes only an\r\nemotional appeal and into whose make-up the intellectual has never been\r\nallowed to enter.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nItaly's right to a place among musical nations of the day cannot be\r\ndenied. Not only in the producing of worthy music-dramas, of orchestral\r\nworks, of chamber music, but also in the noble art-song is she active.\r\nA change has come over her. Perhaps her musicians are being better\r\ntrained. Yet the St. Cecilia Academy in Rome, the conservatories in\r\nMilan, Naples, Genoa, and Bologna have always equipped their students\r\nwell. It may not be this so much as it is the imbuing of those who\r\nchoose lives in art with the responsibility of their calling. Further,\r\nit is the advance which musical art has made all over the world.\r\nThe young Italian composer of to-day has behind him Wagner and his\r\nglorious achievement, Strauss and his superb essays in the operatic and\r\norchestral fields, the Frenchmen and their innovations. What did he\r\nhave fifty years ago? Was it not to the old-style Italian opera that he\r\nlooked with a burning to achieve a work of this type and win popular\r\nsuccess? And one point that affects all modern composition is quite\r\nas valid in Italy as it is anywhere: Composers, in fact, musicians in\r\ngeneral, are being better educated; they are feeling the correlation of\r\nthe arts; they have studied the literatures of many nations, they know\r\nthe paintings of many masters. In this lie the wonderful possibilities\r\nof the future! And modern musical art has its pathway, one quite as\r\nopen and as free as that of any of its brothers, in which it must\r\naccomplish its task. Italy will not be behind in the future as she has\r\nbeen in the past. For she has a Zandonai, a Montemezzi, a Gui to lead\r\nher on.\r\n\r\n                                                           A. W. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 V\r\n\r\nSince the late Renaissance Spain has been generally regarded as\r\nbackward in music. And until recently the reputation was deserved. But\r\nwithin the last two decades musicians have become aware that there is a\r\nvigorous and extremely talented school of native and patriotic Spanish\r\ncomposers, working sincerely and effectively. As always happens in\r\nsuch cases, we find on closer examination that the revival of musical\r\ncreativeness is not a recent thing, but has been going on definitely\r\nfor half a century or more. But every indigenous musical school must go\r\nthrough a period of internal development, and the modern Spanish school\r\nhas been no exception. It is even probable that this school has by no\r\nmeans begun to approach maturity. Though it assiduously cultivates\r\nnational materials and even issues national manifestoes, its idiom is\r\nborrowed in the main from France, and it is to Paris that the promising\r\nyoung composers still look for tuition and inspiration. The national\r\nmaterial as used by the modern Spanish composers has no more been\r\ninfused into the spirit and technique of their product than the Russian\r\nfolk-songs were infused into the Russian music of Glinka's time. Modern\r\nSpanish music seems to be in a preparatory stage. It has two main lines\r\nof activity--the opera and the genre piece for piano. In the former\r\nclass Spanish composers have produced little that has carried beyond\r\nthe borders, though their industry is indefatigable. But in piano music\r\nthey have enriched modern concert literature with many a piece of\r\nsparkling vitality and able workmanship.\r\n\r\nAmong the precursors of the recent renaissance the name of Baltasar\r\nSaldoni (1807-1891) is most eminent. He was born in Barcelona, and\r\nreceived his education in the monastery of Monserrat. Throughout\r\nthe greater part of his life he was distinguished as an organist,\r\nteacher and scholar as well as a composer. His important works were\r\na symphony, _O mia patria_; a 'Hymn to the god of Art'; some operas\r\nand operettas, and a quantity of church and organ music written in a\r\nsevere contrapuntal style. Miguel Eslava (1807-1878) also deserves\r\nmention both as composer and scholar. But greater than either is\r\nFelippe Pedrell (born 1841 and still living), who with Isaac Albéniz\r\n(born 1860) may be called the founder of modern Spanish music. Both\r\nwere ardent nationalists; both were thorough and industrious scholars;\r\nand both wrote with distinction in large forms as well as small. Though\r\nPedrell, the student, was particularly eminent in the department of\r\nSpanish ecclesiastical music, Pedrell the composer essayed chiefly\r\nthose forms which ordinarily bring the maximum of worldly success.\r\nHis early operas--_El último Abencerage_ (1874), _Quasimodo_ (1875),\r\nand 'Cleopatra' (1878)--were produced in Spain at a time when the\r\nnative public would hardly lend an ear to anything except Italian\r\noperas of the old school and its beloved _Zarzuelas_, or operettas.\r\nHis orchestral works are large in design and admirably executed. They\r\ninclude a _Chanson Latine_, the _March à Mistral_, the _Chant de\r\nla Montague_ (a suite of orchestral 'pictures'), and the symphonic\r\npoems--'Tasso at Ferrara' and 'Mazeppa.' In addition to many songs\r\nand small piano pieces, Pedrell wrote considerable choral music, in\r\nparticular the noble 'Gloria Mass.' But his greatest work, and the one\r\nwhich has chiefly won him the respect of musicians in outside lands,\r\nis his operatic trilogy, 'The Pyrenees,' designed as a sort of hymn\r\nof praise to his native land. The whole work was produced in 1902\r\nin Barcelona, where the composer has worked indefatigably, causing\r\nthe city to attain a peculiar musical importance somewhat parallel to\r\nthat which Weimar attained in Germany under the régime of Liszt. The\r\nthree parts of 'The Pyrenees' are denominated, respectively, _Patrie_,\r\n_Amor_, and _Fides_, three words forming an old and illustrious Spanish\r\narmorial inscription. In the prologue a bard chants the sorrows of\r\nSpain. The first part of the work is the story of a nation sunk into a\r\ndespair and then liberated. The liberator is symbolized in the hero,\r\nthe Comte de Foix, while the legendary spirit of the mountains is\r\npersonified in a juglara, Raig de Lluna. Especially fine is the second\r\nact of _Patrie_, where the sombre chant of the monks mingles with the\r\nfanfare of the soldiers, the music of a passing funeral cortège, and\r\nthe melancholy song of the jongluera.\r\n\r\nWhereas Pedrell specialized in ancient Spanish church music, Albéniz\r\nmade a study of the folk-tunes of his people. And this with the\r\ndeliberate purpose of using them as a basis for a new Spanish school\r\nof composition. With unfailing energy he carried out his life-program,\r\nand, though he did not succeed in carrying the fame of his native\r\nland into many foreign capitals (except for his superb piano pieces),\r\nhe gave energy to the awakening instincts of native composers, and\r\nset a high standard for their work. He was in his early youth a\r\n'boy-wonder' pianist, and as such studied under some of the most\r\nfamous masters in Europe, among them Marmontel in Paris, Reinecke in\r\nLeipzig, and Liszt in Rome. As a composer he was largely self-taught.\r\nHis early piano work was undistinguished, but his technical ability\r\ngrew astonishingly with the course of the years. His opera, _Pepita\r\nJimenez_, is regarded as the most distinguished operatic achievement\r\nof modern Spain. It is frankly a 'folk-opera' and makes lavish use of\r\nthe specific Spanish rhythms and tunes which the composer collected in\r\nhis years of research among the people. The score shows an easy mastery\r\nof counterpoint, but the vocal parts are rather uninteresting, and\r\nthe work as a whole lacks the charm which one would expect. Albéniz's\r\nother works for the stage are the operas _Enrico Clifford_ and 'King\r\nArthur,' and the operetta 'The Magic Opal' (produced in London in\r\n1893). The oratorio _Christus_ also has a high place in the music of\r\nmodern Spain. But Albéniz's most successful works are his piano pieces.\r\nThese have been called 'the soul of modern Spain.' They seem to range\r\nover the whole land, paying homage to a city or a valley, picturing a\r\nstreet scene in festival time or some striking bit of native scenery.\r\nTheir melodies and rhythms are Spanish from beginning to end. But their\r\ntechnique is that of modern France. Albéniz, and all his compatriots\r\nin music, had their best lessons in Paris, and they could not fail to\r\nreflect the powerful influence from the north. It is to their credit\r\n(to Albéniz's in particular, since he chiefly insisted upon it) that\r\nwith a French technique and a set of æsthetic ideals unmistakably\r\nFrench they still produced a music that was national and personal.\r\nAlbéniz's best works for the piano are his two suites, 'Iberia' and\r\n'The Alhambra.' These have taken their place in modern concert programs\r\nbeside the works of Debussy and Ravel, and have given their composer\r\nan international reputation as one of the leading 'impressionists' of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent living Spanish composer in this style is Enrico\r\nGranados (born 1867). Like Albéniz, he has worked in the larger\r\nforms, and his works deserved at least this partial listing: the\r\noperas--_María de la Alcarria_ (1893) and _Folletto_ (1898), the\r\nsymphonic poems, _La Nit del Mort_ and 'Dante'; the incidental music\r\nto Mestres' fairy play, _Liliano_; a quartet and a piano trio, in\r\naddition to many songs. But, again like Albéniz, it is in his piano\r\npieces that he has done his best work. These show all the modern\r\nFrench characteristics--highly spiced harmony, free use of dissonances\r\nof the second, clear but astonishingly intricate pianistic style,\r\nfree use of the whole tone scale and of exotic tonalities, and daring\r\ncharacterization and realism. But its complexity is not so much that\r\nof development as of ornamentation--which is a quality more peculiarly\r\nSpanish. As with Albéniz's piano works, the composer pays tribute\r\nto many a Spanish town and to many a Spanish custom, and loves to\r\nintroduce a local color at once authentic and suggestive. Granados'\r\nmost important groups of piano pieces are the _Goyescas_, the 'Songs of\r\nYouth,' the _Danzas Españolas_, and the 'Poetic Waltzes.'\r\n\r\nHardly inferior to Granados in the writing of genre pieces for piano\r\nis Joaquin Turina. This composer's most important piano work is the\r\nsuite _Sevilla_, a fascinating group of tone pictures drawn from the\r\ndaily life of the city. His writing is marked by great delicacy and\r\nkeen feeling for the finer vibrations of the modern piano. Among his\r\nother works we should mention an opera, _Fea e con Gracia_ (1905), a\r\nstring quartet, and a _Scène andalouse_ for piano and violin (1913).\r\nOther Spanish composers who have gained eminence in their native land\r\nare K. Usandizaga, who is a pupil of d'Indy, and whose opera _Las\r\nColoudrinas_ was produced in Madrid in 1914; Vives, the composer of\r\nthe nationalistic opera _Tabare_ (1914); and Costa Nogueras, composer\r\nof _Flor de almendro_ (1901), _Ines de Castro_ (1905) and _Valieri_\r\n(1906). Gabriel Grovlez (born 1882) has written colorful piano music\r\nin the new style, and Garcia Roble has made successful essays in the\r\nlarger forms. The great violinist Pablo Sarasate (1884-1908) is eminent\r\nas a spirited composer for violin. Raoul Laparra, though he is of\r\nSpanish parentage and has worked with Spanish materials, should rather\r\nbe treated among the composers of modern France.[76]\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished composers of modern Portugal should be\r\nmentioned Verreira d'Arneiro (born 1838), who has gained a wide\r\nreputation with his 'Symphonic Cantata' and his opera, 'The Elixir\r\nof Youth'; and Carlo Gomez (1839-1896), who was chiefly active as a\r\ncomposer of operas in the Italian style for Italian theatres. The most\r\neminent Portuguese composer of recent times, however, is the admirable\r\npianist Jose Vianna da Motta (born 1868). A quartet and a symphony from\r\nhis pen have been played with success, but he is best known by his\r\npiano pieces, notably the 'Portuguese Scenes' and the five 'Portuguese\r\nRhapsodies.'\r\n\r\n                                                            H.

It gives us\r\nan easy group-symbol for a large and unexpected outburst of activity;\r\nbut it does not either state or explain a fact. _Re-naissance_ means\r\n'a being born again,' and that implies previous death. But the flame\r\nof life had never quite died out in the country to whose first great\r\ncomposer (Dunstable) the modern world owes the invention of musical art.\r\n\r\nIn its church and choral music especially there had always been a\r\nflicker of life which at least once, in the reigns of Elizabeth and\r\nthe first James, had blazed up into an astounding vitality. However,\r\nit was not to be expected that the nation could go on living at this\r\nwhite heat. The flame burnt itself down, but not out; and the embers\r\nof a national art that had once been great enough to light up the wide\r\nspaces of the world smouldered through the eighteenth century and far\r\ninto the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nThe history of this ecclesiastical music might almost have been\r\npredicted. Its postulates are merely the isolation and selfishness\r\nof the English Church from the days of William and Mary to those of\r\nthe Oxford movement. But there are some other factors governing the\r\nproductions of 'secular' music; and these we must examine.\r\n\r\nFrom about the time of Purcell's death onwards (1695) England was\r\nengaged in eating up as much of the world as possible. And the result\r\nwas national indigestion. Already in Charles II's time there had been\r\nalarming signs of an after-dinner torpidity which could find pleasure\r\nonly in the latest trickeries imported from France. The old healthy\r\ndelight in music as the recreation of freemen was disappearing; and the\r\nEnglishman, spending his long day in the conquest, the civilization,\r\nand the administration of his great empire, found himself in the\r\nevening too weary for anything but contemptuous applause.\r\n\r\nHence began the artistic invasion of England. The foreigner was quick\r\nto see his opportunity in the preoccupations of the nation. Over the\r\nsea he came in shoals, impelled partly by the very natural belief in\r\nhis own nation as the source of all _kultur_, and principally by his\r\ninterest in the pound sterling. And, once landed, there he remained.\r\nHis motto was that of the old Hanoverian countess: 'Ve kom for all your\r\ngoots.'\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary in this place to detail either the methods or the\r\npernicious effects of this unnatural domination. Händel was a great,\r\ngood, and pure-minded man, but when he came to England in 1710 he came\r\nto be a curse and an incubus brooding over the English spirit for\r\n150 years. Music very nearly died there and, when the corpse showed\r\nany signs of reviving, some foreign professor was always at hand to\r\nstifle its faint cries, or, if that was not enough, to do a little\r\nquiet blood-letting 'just to make sure.' Even in the third quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century England maintained men like Karl Halle (later\r\nCharles Hallé, and later still _Sir_ Charles Hallé) who were content to\r\naccept position, affluence, and titles, giving in exchange bitter and\r\npersistent opposition to the creative art of their adopted country.\r\n\r\nThis deplorable state of affairs continued more or less down to the\r\nmiddle year of last century. About that time certain forces came into\r\nplay which have markedly changed the social and artistic conditions\r\nof England. And only in this sense can we say that there has been\r\nsuch a thing as a renaissance or rebirth of music. Looked at from\r\nthe twentieth-century end of the telescope the changes seem violent\r\nand unbelievable; but, if we put the glass down and walk through the\r\ncountry itself, we shall be forced to accept them as only a natural and\r\ninevitable broadening of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe main fact on which we wish to dwell here is that between the years\r\n1870 and 1915 England has been able to assert her nationality in\r\nmusic. And this is a matter of the deepest interest to all Americans\r\nwho love their country. The preponderance of blood here is Anglo-Saxon\r\nand, though America has the advantages and disadvantages of a mixed\r\npopulation, she has yet to learn the lesson already learned by some\r\nother peoples, that only by the paths of nationalism can she scale the\r\nheights of internationalism.\r\n\r\nIn more ways than one America's 1915 is England's 1870. The American\r\ncomposer need not engrave this fact on his notepaper, but he may be\r\nrecommended by a sincere well-wisher to keep it in his heart. On both\r\nthe material and the spiritual sides it is true. Watch the orchestral\r\nplayers on a Sunday night at the 'Metropolitan.' They are the sons of\r\nthe men who were playing in 1870 at Covent Garden. But since then the\r\nEnglishman has asserted his personality; and to-day there is scarcely\r\na foreigner in any first-class English orchestra. Again, read through\r\nthe synopses of novelties in any season's concert programs here. How\r\nmany are American? Almost none. A hundred million people owning half\r\na continent with vast waterways, prairies, and mountain ranges--yet\r\nmusically nearly inarticulate! There must be something wrong here.\r\n\r\nLet us hasten to add that the brain-stuff of the American composer is\r\njust as good as the brain-stuff of any other composer. More than that,\r\nhe alone of all his countrymen seems to be aware that the price of\r\nvictory is battle and death in battle.\r\n\r\nNo one can say that England has yet conquered the world in a musical\r\nsense. Still her achievements are much greater than are generally\r\nrecognized on this side of the Atlantic. The art-works which represent\r\nthese achievements lie mostly on composers' shelves and in publishers'\r\ncellars, kept there partly by their own strangeness and partly by the\r\ntimidity and self-effacement of their authors.\r\n\r\nAlready similar works are being produced in America; and it is\r\ntherefore hoped that a consideration of the musical conditions and\r\nprocesses in England between 1870 and 1915 may be helpful to American\r\ncomposers. One may add that at the earlier date the outside English\r\npublic was just as heavily ignorant and indifferent as the American\r\npublic is now. In the one case the leaven came, and in the other is\r\ncoming from within.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nIn a short sketch like the present it is not possible to discuss fully\r\nthe changed social conditions which brought about the English musical\r\nrenaissance. One must, however, mention two forces which, acting\r\nsomewhat blindly on the individual, yet produced great effects in\r\nthe mass. The first of these was the re-cognition that the man who\r\nmattered was the man of the soil. From this re-cognition sprang the\r\nwhole folk-song movement--a movement whose depth and importance are\r\nstill very little understood in America. The second is the growth of\r\nhealthy liberal opinions and the partial reconsideration of the English\r\ncaste-system. On this change the example of democratic America has\r\nundoubtedly had great influence. The result of this levelling upwards\r\nand downwards can be seen in the fact that, whereas prior to 1870 the\r\nEnglish composer was generally a scallywag, now he is a gentleman.[77]\r\n\r\nWe have already said that England was never quite dead musically. To\r\nthe outsider she may have appeared so, but it was really only a 'deep\r\nsurgical anæsthesia.' And the analogy holds. She had been operated\r\non so often by her German specialists that, as she came out of her\r\nsleep, she only very gradually began to ask herself whether, without\r\nanother operation, she might not be able to find health by dismissing\r\nher doctors and changing her mode of life. Naturally it was a wrench\r\nto her to send the doctors packing; and her weak system almost, but\r\nnot quite, refused her new diet of English bread and English water. In\r\nother words, if we divide the men of the English musical renaissance\r\ninto three groups according to age, we shall find that the oldest\r\ngroup--to whom belongs all the honor of the spade--were almost to a man\r\nforeign-trained. Their main ideals were Joachim and Brahms, and their\r\nchief quarrel with the second and third groups--their pupils, be it\r\nsaid--was the quarrel between German technique and English.\r\n\r\nTo the most distinguished thinker of that school the correct way of\r\nwriting a song is still the German way. The rest-of-the-world way is\r\nsimply _wrong_. Race, feeling, national sentiment, all go for nothing.\r\nIn effect he says: 'You may draw your water from a spring in Kent,\r\nin Maryland, or in Siberia; but it won't travel except in disused\r\nRhine-wine bottles.' The proposition only needs stating to be condemned.\r\n\r\nThis is, in small, the attitude of the oldest group. But we must\r\nremember that most of them continually forget their treasonable\r\ntheories and prove their loyalty to national ideals in their practice.\r\nIt is not a complete loyalty, but it is one to which all respect\r\nand honor are due. We must not judge it by the tree of which it was\r\nitself the seed, but by the sickly undergrowth among which it managed\r\nto strike root. And this shrivelled stuff is represented to us by\r\nsuch names as E. J. Loder (1813-65), H. H. Pierson (1815-73), and W.\r\nSterndale Bennett (1816-75). The last-named composer in especial is\r\na striking instance of an able but weak personality overwhelmed by\r\ncircumstance. When he was a student among the Germans his docility to\r\ntheir ideals won Schumann's approval. Returning to England, he found\r\nhimself, so to speak, hanging in the air like an orchid--without\r\nroots. Naturally he withered away. And for many years England had the\r\nspectacle of her chief musician dribbling out smooth Anglo-German\r\nplatitudes, while Germany herself was producing _Lohengrin_, _Tristan_,\r\nand 'The Ring.' Only one work of his has weathered the storm of the\r\nEnglish musical revival--'The Naiads.' But, of course, neither he,\r\nnor Loder, nor Pierson had any closer connection with the English\r\nrenaissance than the glow-worm has with the coming sun. All three of\r\nthese men were as clever as any living American or English composer.\r\nThey were all driven into indignant silence, sullen despair, or musical\r\nmadness by the anti-national conditions of their time.\r\n\r\nContrast their output with that of the seven musical children whom the\r\nfairy-stork brought to the rebirth of English music. Their names and\r\nnatal years are: Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842), Alexander Campbell\r\nMackenzie (1847), Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848), Arthur Goring\r\nThomas (1851), Frederic Hymen Cowen (1852), Charles Villiers Stanford\r\n(1852), and Edward William Elgar (1857). These seven men then--all\r\nGerman-trained except Elgar and Thomas--yet draw a large part of their\r\nvitality from the soil on which they were bred. One only needs to\r\nhear an Irish Rhapsody of Stanford, a big chorus of Parry, or a gay\r\nlittle song of Sullivan to become aware of a 'new something' in art.\r\nAnd, if the American reader be inclined to doubt this 'new something'\r\nat a first hearing, he may be earnestly advised to ask himself this\r\nquestion: 'What would be my first impressions of a symphonic poem by\r\nStrauss if that were my first introduction to a German art-work?'\r\n\r\nThe fertility of all these composers is so amazing that any attempt\r\nto catalogue their works would stifle the rest of this volume. Songs,\r\noperas, symphonies, sonatas, variations, church music, and choral works\r\nall pour forth in an endless stream. Under the one heading, 'works for\r\nvoice and orchestra,' Parry has 33 entries. Stanford's opus numbers\r\napproach 150, and he begins with 7 operas, 7 symphonies, incidental\r\nmusic to 5 plays, and 27 'orchestral and choral works.' Cowen has\r\nwritten 4 operas, 4 oratorios, 6 symphonies, and 18 cantatas; and that\r\nis only the beginning of his list. It is plainly impossible even to\r\nhint at this enormous mass of material. We must content ourselves with\r\na rapid glance at the distinguishing features of each composer.\r\n\r\nSullivan, the man who endeared himself personally and musically to\r\na generation, needs no introduction. His work is practically summed\r\nup in the words 'Savoy Opera.' And these words stand everywhere for\r\nmelodic charm and fancy, delicate humor, and exquisitely finished\r\nworkmanship. On the more æsthetic side we owe him a lasting debt 'for\r\nhis recognition of the fact that it was not only necessary to set his\r\ntext to music which was pleasing in itself, but to invent melodies in\r\nsuch close alliance with the words that the two things became (to the\r\nhearer) indistinguishable.' His long series of works beginning with\r\n'Contrabandista,' 'Cox and Box,' and 'Trial by Jury' continued through\r\n'Patience,' 'Pinafore,' 'The Mikado,' 'The Yeomen of the Guard,' 'The\r\nGondoliers,' and others, till his death interrupted the composition of\r\nhis last work, 'The Emerald Isle.' It must be added that both in his\r\nsimple concert songs and in his choral music Sullivan enjoyed a wide\r\npopularity. This is now waning. Of his larger concert works 'The Golden\r\nLegend' and the overture 'Di Ballo' possess the greatest vitality.\r\n\r\nMackenzie, who succeeded Macfarren (1813-87) as principal of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Music, is a man of forceful character. Like Sullivan,\r\nhe was trained in Germany and came back a brilliant contrapuntist\r\nwith wide, far-reaching musical intentions. Familiar with every\r\nnook in the orchestra, he has produced a mass of concert and opera\r\nmusic all characterized by great technical dexterity and a certain\r\ncontinual color and warmth. More than once the present writer has\r\nbeen surprised by some particularly modern stroke of his orchestral\r\nexpression and, after ascribing it to the influence of the most neo of\r\nneo-continentals, has discovered that Mackenzie was doing it before its\r\nsupposed author was born. It is a common word in London that Stanford\r\nand Mackenzie spend their evenings reading each other's full-scores,\r\nboth missing out the German parts. Of Mackenzie's works the best known\r\nare the violin 'Benedictus' and 'Pibroch,' the orchestral ballad\r\n_La Belle Dame sans Merci_, the cantatas 'The Story of Sayid,' 'The\r\nCottar's Saturday Night,' 'The Dream of Jubal,' and, finally, the\r\never-popular overture 'Britannia.'\r\n\r\nThe English public connects Parry's name mainly with his colossal\r\nchoral writings and with his directorship of The Royal College of\r\nMusic. That, however, by no means exhausts the list of his activities.\r\nIn the realms of song, of symphonic and chamber music, he has shown\r\nan astonishing fertility. His productions are marked throughout by a\r\nboundless contrapuntal skill based very decidedly on the old order of\r\nthings. To his heroic mind forty-part writing is probably very much\r\nwhat four-part writing is to the rest of mankind. A sort of hard-knit\r\nsincerity and a lyrical grandeur pervade all his works. One feels\r\nthat, if Milton's father had had his son's genius, he would have been\r\na seventeenth-century Parry. Of humor he has none, but in its place a\r\nconstant cheerfulness characteristic of a certain very good type of\r\nEnglishman. His best-loved work is undoubtedly 'Blest Pair of Sirens.'\r\nBut after that we must mention 'The Glories of Our Blood and State,'\r\n_L'Allegro ed il Pensieroso_, 'Lady Radnor's Suite,' the 'Symphonic\r\nVariations in E minor,' and the beautiful series of 'English Lyrics.'\r\n\r\nGoring Thomas was an Englishman who, with the help of great natural\r\ntalent and of long residence in France, almost performed the miracle\r\nof successfully changing his nationality. Of course, he had to pay the\r\nprice; and it was heavy. After burning incense at the altar of French\r\nideals he came back to a country where grand opera was only an annual\r\nimportation symbolical of financial respectability. He might have done\r\nSullivan's work better than Sullivan. But the fates were inexorably\r\nagainst him. He did not even get a knighthood. Imagine Saint-Saëns\r\ncaught young and studying Handelian counterpoint at the Royal Academy\r\nof Music; or Stravinsky doing 'fifth grade harmony' at the Royal\r\nCollege of Music with his eye on the organ-loft at York Minster or\r\nthe conductor's seat at the Gaiety as possible goals of his ambition.\r\nEither instance will give the curious reader some idea of Thomas's\r\ndifficulties, social and psychological. One must add that he cannot be\r\ndenied great charm of manner and a strong selective gift both in his\r\nmelody and harmony. He had all the Frenchman's talent for recognizing\r\ndramatic effect and securing it swiftly. His best-known works are\r\n'Esmeralda,' 'Nadeshda,' and 'The Swan and the Skylark.'\r\n\r\nCowen is a West Indian Jew. His artistic activities, however, have\r\nmainly centred round London and Glasgow. In the former place he has\r\nconducted the 'Philharmonic,' and in the latter the Scottish Orchestra.\r\nAs a composer he has been both over-blamed and over-praised. His blood\r\nundoubtedly gives him facility, adaptability, and a somewhat detached\r\nviewpoint. These qualities, academically praised by the Anglo-Saxon,\r\nyet excite in England a certain half-envious distrust when actually\r\nexercised. For instance, the English musician does not care two raps\r\nabout the style of composition commonly called 'ye olde English'; but\r\nhe thinks it scarcely proper that Cowen should be able to write in\r\nthat style so well. Again, in his heart of hearts the professional man\r\nprobably thinks that King David's ultimate object in writing Psalm 130\r\nwas the afternoon service at Westminster Abbey; and here, too, Cowen's\r\npen causes some uneasiness. On the other side of the picture we have\r\nhad the composer figuring with the public for years as a miracle of\r\ncharm, grace, and delicate fancy. A fair view of Cowen would probably\r\nshow him as a composer somewhat isolated from his fellows, naturally\r\ninclined to the lighter side of life, and perhaps more anxious for the\r\nlaurel than for the dust. His easy yet punctilious technique is shown\r\nin a long list of popular works. Of these the most successful are his\r\ntwo sets of 'Old English Dances,' the orchestral suite 'The Language\r\nof Flowers,' the overture 'The Butterflies' Ball,' the 'Scandinavian,'\r\n'Welsh,' and 'Idyllic' symphonies, and the choral works 'Ruth,' 'The\r\nRose Maiden,' 'The Sleeping Beauty,' and the 'Ode to the Passions.'\r\n\r\nStanford and Ireland contribute respectively to English musical life\r\nand to the empire what a penn'orth of yeast does to a basin of dough.\r\nAs far as one may judge the ferment cannot be stopped. Its chemical\r\nconstituents are wit, clarity, and humor, all combined by a delightful\r\nease and precision of technique. Stanford's scores are models of\r\nelegant reticence and their 'form' is beyond reproach. In all his\r\nwork one notices a constant refusal to accept gloom for poetry. He\r\nis a musical Oliver Goldsmith of the nineteenth century. No one has\r\ndone more for the preservation, the arranging, and the publishing of\r\nIrish folk-song. Among the best-known of his works are his comic opera\r\n'Shamus O'Brien,' his 'Irish Rhapsodies,' his 'Variations on an English\r\nTheme,' and his many fine string quartets and quintets. In the realm of\r\nsong-literature both original and arranged he has a great record; much\r\nof his church music is by now classic on both sides of the Atlantic;\r\nand he has made a very special success with his striking Choral\r\nBallads. In these last three departments one may mention his 'Cavalier\r\nSongs' and his 'Songs of Old Ireland'; his Services in B-flat, A and\r\nF; 'The Revenge,' 'The Voyage of Maeldune,' 'The Bard,' and 'Phaudrig\r\nCrohoore.'\r\n\r\nElgar's advantage over the other six members of this group lies,\r\nnot merely in his comparative youth, but in the fact that he began\r\nhis serious and prolonged husbandry after the others had done the\r\nploughing. Practically self-educated, he set out with the very noble\r\ndetermination to conquer the world unaided except by his own brains.\r\nWhat this determination means in a densely populated, imperialistic\r\ncountry like England probably very few Americans can realize. From\r\nhis home in Malvern and later in London he began to issue a series\r\nof works, few in number as the men of his generation counted these\r\nthings, but of unsurpassed poetical quality. His earlier work, such as\r\n'King Olaf' and 'Caractacus,' met with no very wide appreciation; but,\r\nwith the appearance of his 'Enigma Variations,' his 'Sea Songs,' and\r\nhis beautiful oratorio, 'The Dream of Gerontius,' came general European\r\nrecognition. His present unassailable position in England may be gauged\r\nfrom the fact that his oratorios--saturated with the Roman Catholic\r\nspirit--are welcomed even in the English cathedrals. Nor are the\r\nDeans and Chapters incensed thereby. Of his other works--such as the\r\novertures 'In the South' and 'Cockaigne,' the 'Pomp and Circumstance'\r\nmarches, the two enormous Symphonies, the Violin Concerto, and the\r\noratorios 'The Kingdom' and 'The Apostles'--it is not possible to speak\r\nhere in detail. All Elgar's work is characterized by great sincerity\r\nand purity of intention. He is an ample master both of harmony and\r\ncounterpoint; while his sense of orchestral decoration is astonishing.\r\nOne must in fairness add that he has often been charged with a certain\r\nindecision and melodic indefiniteness. These are perhaps national\r\ntraits; and the gravamen of this charge may be lightened as Teutonic\r\nstandards of judgment become less and less generally enforced.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this group of composers we must mention the\r\nfact--already hinted at--that their general education and social level\r\nis undoubtedly high as compared with that of their predecessors. This\r\npoint need not be elaborated. But its effect is seen in the publication\r\nof various volumes dealing with the æsthetic and historical sides of\r\nmusic. Of these, Hubert Parry's two great volumes on 'Johann Sebastian\r\nBach' and 'Style in Musical Art' are easily first. Only second to them\r\nis the same author's work on 'The Seventeenth Century' contributed to\r\nthe 'Oxford History of Music.' And he has three or four others to his\r\ncredit. Stanford has published two delightful books of memoirs and a\r\nshort treatise on 'Musical Composition.' Frederick Corder, besides\r\na considerable list of compositions, has produced three volumes, of\r\nwhich the best-known is 'The Orchestra and How to Write for It.' The\r\nawakening taste for musical study at this period can perhaps be best\r\nappreciated by considering the wide popularity of Ebenezer Prout's dry,\r\nstubborn volumes on musical technique.\r\n\r\nFinally, in order to complete the list of names associated with this\r\nmovement, one must add John Stainer and George Martin, both of St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral; Walter Parratt, the distinguished 'Master of the\r\nKing's Musick'; and Frederick Bridge of Westminster Abbey. Of the dozen\r\nmen named above ten received titles from the Sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\nThe members of the second and third groups shared with Elgar the\r\nadvantages of much improved musical conditions. After twenty-five\r\nyears' hard work the older generation of composers had educated the\r\ncountry to a wider, deeper, and purer appreciation of music. They had\r\neven arrived at a tacit understanding with their countrymen that an\r\nEnglishman might, under certain conditions, be able to compose. Of this\r\nunderstanding their pupils took immediate advantage. Let us see of what\r\nthese improved conditions consisted.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, outside the provincial church festivals, orchestral\r\nopportunity for the English composer meant a few concerts conducted by\r\nAugust Manns at the Crystal Palace and a few more given by the London\r\nPhilharmonic Society. To-day there is a larger number of first-class\r\norchestral players in London than in any other city in the world.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent this is the result of the insatiable London appetite\r\nfor musical comedy performed with a beauty and lavishness unknown\r\nin America. For the orchestral player who cannot live by symphony\r\nwork alone can live by symphony and theatre work combined. The number\r\nof orchestras both metropolitan and provincial has thus increased\r\nenormously. The percentage of English works played has also increased,\r\nthough there is still room for some improvement in that respect.\r\n\r\nIn London alone there are, besides the Covent Garden Orchestra--the\r\nRoyal Philharmonic, the Queen's Hall,[78] the London Symphony,\r\nthe New Symphony, and the Beecham. All of these can and do tackle\r\nsuccessfully the most modern music. A certain number of excellent\r\namateur orchestras, such as the Royal Amateur, the Stock Exchange,\r\nand the Strolling Players, testify to a wide interest in this form of\r\nmusic. Outside London there are permanent orchestras at such places as\r\nBournemouth, Brighton, Glasgow, Harrogate, Liverpool, Manchester, and\r\nTorquay.\r\n\r\nAmong conductors who have at one time or other interested themselves\r\nin English music may be mentioned Henry J. Wood, Granville Bantock,\r\nGodfrey, Thomas Beecham, Balfour Gardiner, Landon Ronald. And this\r\nleaves out of account the theatrical conductors, the older musicians\r\nmost of whom have conducted either at the Royal Philharmonic or at some\r\nprovincial festival, and the conductors of choral societies, such as\r\nGeorge Riseley, Frederick Bridge, Allen Gill, Henry Coward, and Arthur\r\nFagge.\r\n\r\nThe second point which calls for notice is the folk-song movement,\r\nwhich has forced composers to reconsider some of the fundamentals\r\nof their art and at the same time has furnished them with a mass of\r\nmaterial on which to work. We must remember that, from the early\r\nmiddle ages until the present day, the traditional music of Europe\r\n(folk-song) has continued to flow in a sort of underground stream,\r\nwhile the written or professional music has been the main official\r\nwaterway. The two have constantly joined their currents, and at times\r\nthe underground stream has actually been in advance of the river\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nThe important point is that, in England and Ireland at any rate, the\r\nfolk-song, orally transmitted, has practically evolved as a _separate_\r\nart-form with its own ways and means of expression. And the outstanding\r\nfeature of the movement is the recognition of this art-form as a thing\r\nof beauty, of vitality, and of necessity to the nation. One might make\r\na very fair division of English composers into those who do not use\r\nfolk-tunes, those who do for cheque-book reasons, and those who do\r\nbecause they must.\r\n\r\nIn England the missioners of this movement came only just in time.\r\nWhen they visited the country and seaboard towns of such counties as\r\nNorfolk and Somerset they found the art of folk-singing unknown except\r\nto the oldest inhabitants. Luckily, however, these sturdy grandfathers\r\nkept in their minds a great treasure of folk-song, and it was from\r\ntheir lips that our present collections were made. With this work the\r\nname of Cecil Sharp will always be honorably joined. There is now very\r\nlittle chance of folk-song dying, but, as everywhere else, the genuine\r\nfolk-singer is practically extinct.\r\n\r\nIrish folk-song has been the subject of conscious literary enquiry\r\nfor nearly two hundred years. And this is not to be wondered at when\r\nwe consider that, of all folk-song, it is first in musical charm,\r\nvariety, and depth of poetical feeling. In this department the most\r\nimportant recent contribution by far is Stanford's monumental edition\r\nof the complete 'Petrie Collection'; but, besides that, he has\r\nrestored and arranged Moore's 'Irish Melodies' and has published two\r\nvolumes containing altogether eighty Irish songs and ballads with\r\naccompaniments. Both in Wales and Scotland there has been a similar but\r\nless important activity.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this hasty sketch of the English folk-song movement\r\nwe must point out that its effect on English composition was only\r\ngradually felt. The men of the second group had been too strictly\r\ntrained in the tradition of the elders to feel quite comfortable\r\nunder the new dispensation. They acknowledged but evaded its power.\r\nTheir successors, on the other hand, viewed it, not as a curious\r\narchæological discovery, but as a living spring from which they could\r\ndraw their vitality.\r\n\r\nThe two most eminent names in the second group of composers are\r\nundoubtedly Frederic Delius (b. 1863) and Granville Bantock (b. 1868).\r\n\r\nThe former was born in Bradford, lived for some time in the United\r\nStates, and finally after long residence and marriage in France\r\nbecame almost a foreigner. Blessed with abundant means, he has always\r\nbeen able 'to cherish his genius' and let the world go hang. When he\r\nreappeared in England it was as a solitary stranger unknown even by\r\nname to his co-evals. And this sudden reappearance on the wave-crest of\r\na vigorous English propaganda was not made the subject of loud-voiced\r\nenthusiasms. His brilliant talents excited a perverse misunderstanding;\r\nand he had to live down a certain sore opposition from his\r\ncontemporaries, many of whom had for years been struggling in the Cave\r\nof Æolus to blow up the very wind that sent him into harbor. These are\r\nhappily things of past history, and he is now accepted by the world as\r\na tone-poet of great power and originality. Of his works--most of which\r\nowe their present popularity to the exertions of his friend Thomas\r\nBeecham--one may note 'Paris,' 'Brigg Fair,' 'Appalachia,' 'Seadrift,'\r\n'Dance Rhapsody,' and his great 'Mass of Life.' Of his operas, neither\r\n'Koanga' nor 'A Village Romeo and Juliet' seems to have made a\r\npronounced success.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: Modern British Composers:]\r\n\r\n             Sir G. Hubert H. Parry   Sir Arthur Sullivan\r\n               Granville Bantock        Sir Edward Elgar\r\n\r\nBantock is a man of quite another kidney. The son of a London\r\ndoctor, he has always exerted himself for the benefit of his fellow\r\ncountrymen. In his younger days as conductor of the New Brighton\r\nOrchestra he devoted himself largely to the performance of English\r\nmusic. The present writer, among many others, has to acknowledge that\r\nhis first chance was offered him by Bantock. At the present time he\r\nwields great influence as head of the Midland School of Music at\r\nBirmingham. Bantock's work is characterized by fluent expression and\r\nvivid coloring. His early experiences have given him an almost uncanny\r\ntouch in the orchestra. Perhaps no one knows better than he how to\r\n'score heavily' by 'scoring lightly.' In his choice of subjects he\r\nleans somewhat toward the exotic and oriental. From his long list\r\nof compositions it is only possible to select the orchestral works\r\n'Sappho,' the 'Pierrot of the Minute,' 'The Witch of Atlas,' 'Fifine\r\nat the Fair'; and his vocal-and-orchestral works 'Omar Khayyám,' 'The\r\nFire Worshippers,' the six sets of 'Songs of the East,' and the nine\r\n'Sappho' fragments.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHamish MacCunn (b. 1868) and Edward German (b. 1868),[79] the one a\r\nScot and the other a Welshman, are both more particularly identified\r\nwith the theatre. MacCunn's early orchestral poems, such as 'The Land\r\nof the Mountain and the Flood' and 'The Ship o' the Fiend,' at once\r\nbrought him wide recognition. Their fine poetical qualities are well\r\nknown. A large portion of his time, however, has been devoted to\r\noperatic conducting and composition. In the latter field he has to his\r\ncredit such works as 'Jennie Deans' and 'Diarmid.' But, though MacCunn\r\nis known to all as an able, brilliant musician, he has had to pay the\r\npenalty of his association with that musical Cinderella, English Opera.\r\n\r\nGerman, on the other hand, though never aiming at the sun, has once or\r\ntwice hit a star. He succeeded Sullivan at the Savoy and made successes\r\nwith 'The Emerald Isle,' 'Merrie England,' 'A Princess of Kensington,'\r\nand elsewhere with 'Tom Jones.' His incidental music to 'Henry VIII'\r\nand 'Nell Gwyn' has been liked into dislike. But German has done a\r\ngreat deal more than this. No account of him would be complete that did\r\nnot mention his 'Welsh Rhapsody,' his 'Rhapsody on March Themes,' his\r\n'Gypsy Suite,' and his 'Overture to Richard III.'\r\n\r\nThere is no denying the power, the wide ability, or the technical\r\nresource of Ethel Mary Smyth. Judged by her music alone one would say\r\nthat she was only the _nom de guerre_ of a strong masculine personality\r\nsaturated with Teutonism. This, however, is only a pleasing fancy. As\r\na fact, the terrific earnestness of her music could never have come\r\nfrom the brain of a mere man. Opera is her stronghold, and her greatest\r\nvictory therein a fine Cornish drama, 'The Wreckers.'\r\n\r\nNeither Walford Davies nor Charles Wood has produced music in great\r\nquantity. Both have led somewhat secluded lives; the one as organist of\r\nThe Temple, and the other as a Cambridge don.\r\n\r\nDavies is a man of fastidious taste, a first-class organist and\r\ncontrapuntist, and a profound student of Bach, Browning, and The\r\nBible. It is said that his coy muse sometimes furls her pinions at the\r\napproach of a too red-blooded humanity. However that may be, she has\r\ninspired him with at least one subtle and delicately beautiful work,\r\n'Everyman.'\r\n\r\nCharles Wood is an Irishman from Armagh, a fine scholarly musician and\r\nprobably the best all-round theorist in the country. He has a strong\r\ninterest in the folk-song of his native land and has written a set of\r\norchestral variations on the tune, 'Patrick Sarsfield.' One of his best\r\nthings is his string quartet in A minor. In the realm of choral music\r\nhis 'Ballad of Dundee' may be selected for mention. He has at any rate\r\none great song to his credit--'Ethiopia saluting the colors.'\r\n\r\nArthur Hinton's (b. 1869) work, which is appreciated on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic, includes some elaborate pianoforte music, a two-act\r\nopera, 'Tamara,' a couple of symphonies, the orchestral suite\r\n'Endymion,' and a good deal of chamber music. His compositions are\r\ncharacteristic of the group to which he belongs. A certain delight in\r\nclean, finished workmanship and an incisiveness of expression are their\r\nmain features.\r\n\r\nArthur Somervell has been throughout his life one of the\r\nstandard-bearers of the English revival. And he has kept the\r\nbanner flying both by his enthusiasm for folk-music and by his\r\nown compositions. His graceful, refined songs are sung and liked\r\neverywhere. Of these perhaps the best known is his cycle from\r\nTennyson's 'Maud.' Among his larger works one may mention his\r\n'Normandy' variations for pianoforte and orchestra and his recent\r\nsymphony 'Thalassa.' For some years past Somervell has been the\r\nofficial mainspring which keeps the clock of elementary musical\r\neducation ticking.\r\n\r\nOne of the most admirable features of the later phases in the English\r\nmusical renaissance is the quickened and deepened interest shown\r\nboth in English musical history and in the general topic of musical\r\næsthetics. For the first time since the days of Hawkins and Burney\r\ninvestigators have begun an elaborate search in college, cathedral,\r\nand secular libraries. The existence of a vast store of madrigals,\r\nof church and instrumental music was scarcely suspected even by\r\nprofessional musicians; and the treasure when unearthed came as a\r\nrevelation to musical England.\r\n\r\nIn the field of musical æsthetics there has been an equally remarkable\r\nactivity. And it is noteworthy that a number of men who have devoted\r\ntheir lives to purely musical composition have also produced elaborate\r\nstudies either of the technique, the history, or the psychology of\r\ntheir art. Of these we may name six: Wallace, McEwen, Walker, Tovey,\r\nMacpherson, and Buck.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wallace is, like MacCunn, a Scot from Greenock. His mental\r\ngrowth had its roots in the stiff classical sub-soil of a public\r\nschool, and then pushed its way up through the rocks of a university\r\nmedical course till it flowered in the sweet open air of the R.A.M.\r\ncomposition class. Hence his mind, which almost needs the threefold\r\npormanteau-word 'musiterific' to describe it. Wallace was the first\r\nEnglishman to write a symphonic poem, and he has made this form\r\nsomething of a specialty. The best known of his six are 'The Passing of\r\nBeatrice' and 'Villon.' Of these the latter has been played everywhere,\r\nand the present writer has had to satisfy more than one puzzled\r\nAmerican enquirer as to how the author of 'Maritana'[80] could possibly\r\nhave written it! Some of Wallace's songs, for instance 'Son o' Mine,'\r\nhave acquired a popularity in England almost too great for public\r\ncomfort. In the field of literature he has produced two remarkable\r\nstudies in the development of the musical sense--'The Threshold of\r\nMusic' and 'The Musical Faculty.'\r\n\r\nJohn Blackwood McEwen is, like Wallace, a Scotsman. Furthermore he has\r\nthe same mental and physical homes--Glasgow University, the R.A.M.,\r\nand London. He has produced much symphonic and chamber music all\r\ncharacterized by a severe self-criticism, impeccable workmanship,\r\nand at times a certain Scottish exaltation. His quartets in A minor\r\nand C minor are excellent. Of his symphonic poems the border ballad\r\n'Grey Galloway' can hold up its head in any company. He is an untiring\r\nenquirer into musical fundamentals and, of his five published volumes,\r\nthe most valuable is 'The Thought in Music.'\r\n\r\nBoth Ernest Walker and Donald Francis Tovey are university men. The\r\nformer, who is organist of Balliol College, Oxford, has been much\r\napplauded for his songs and chamber music. He has also rendered great\r\nand lasting service by his admirable 'History of Music in England.'\r\n\r\nTovey--the distinguished occupant of the Reid Chair of Music in\r\nEdinburgh--is a sort of musical Francis Bacon. Few of the English\r\ntales as to his learning and memory would be believed if printed in\r\nAmerica. The most credible is that he is able to play the sketch-books\r\nof Beethoven by heart. His pamphlets of severely analytical criticism\r\nhave, in a way, set a new standard in this kind; while his work in\r\nconnection with the eleventh edition of the 'Encyclopædia Britannica'\r\nhas had the happiest results. Though a very able theorist and\r\nhistorian, Tovey is by no means that alone. He has written a good deal\r\nof chamber music, a concerto for pianoforte and orchestra and, one\r\nhears, an opera. It is difficult to place these works. Some of the\r\nolder musicians have hailed them as greatly instinct with the spirit\r\nof Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms, while some of the younger men have\r\ncatalogued them rather as compilations from those three masters. The\r\ncomposer's own views, throwing a terrific weight onto his isolated\r\nnotes and phrases, seem to make of music a burden almost too heavy to\r\nbear. However this may be, it is quite certain that Tovey has not yet\r\nshot his last bolt.\r\n\r\nWith Stewart Macpherson and Percy C. Buck we may close this list of\r\ncomposer-authors. The former, in addition to a considerable amount of\r\npublished music, has printed ten volumes, mostly on the technique of\r\ncomposition: the latter, besides his music, has written two valuable\r\nworks--'The Organ' and 'The First Year at the Organ.' Naturally the\r\ngreater part of the literary work in connection with this movement\r\nhas been done by scholars who are not themselves composers. Most of\r\nthese men have been in close touch with the leaders of the renaissance;\r\nbut, even when their work has been purely archæological, it has, so to\r\nspeak, cleft the rock and released a fountain of inspiration for their\r\ncreative brethren.\r\n\r\nHenry Davey's 'History of English Music' is a pioneer work embodying\r\nthe results of long and patient research. Its combative determination\r\nto claim honor for the honorable is beyond praise. A similar work,\r\nless scholarly but equally patriotic, is Ernest Ford's 'Short History\r\nof Music in England.' Barclay Squire (of the British Museum), has,\r\nwith his brother-in-law J. A. Fuller Maitland, done much to revive\r\nthe national pride in Purcell and to spread an accurate knowledge\r\nof the earlier Elizabethan and Jacobean composers. Fuller Maitland\r\nhimself, apart from his claims as editor of 'Grove' (2d ed.) and\r\nas a contributor to the 'Oxford History of Music,' always used his\r\ndistinguished position at _The Times_ to further the best interests\r\nof English music. To this list we may add the names of three other\r\nscholar-musicians all associated with the 'Oxford History of Music':\r\nW. H. Hadow, the brilliant editor of the work and at present principal\r\nof the Armstrong College; H. E. Wooldridge; and (the late) Edward\r\nDannreuther, whose life-span stretched from personal contact with\r\nRichard Wagner to patient and sympathetic intercourse with the youngest\r\nschool of English musicians.\r\n\r\nIn the special field of instrumental construction and development\r\nwe have Rev. F. W. Galpin, with his scholarly and delightful volume\r\n'Old English Instruments of Music,' and Kathleen Schlesinger. Of Miss\r\nSchlesinger's painstaking and accurate scholarship her country has by\r\nno means made the acknowledgment it deserves.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of more general musical æsthetics and criticism many\r\nnames might be mentioned. We must content ourselves with those of\r\nErnest Newman, whose profound works on 'Gluck' and 'Wagner' are\r\ndiscussed everywhere, and E. J. Dent, who has studied certain phases of\r\nMozart's work and has published a classical volume on 'Scarlatti.'\r\n\r\nThough it is somewhat outside our special topic, some reference must\r\nbe made here to the English researches into Greek music. For the first\r\ntime since the Germans began to inspissate the gloom, a ray or two\r\nof light has been allowed to fall upon this difficult subject. In\r\nparticular D. B. Monro, with his volume 'The Modes of Ancient Greek\r\nMusic,' has shown that it is not an essential of this study that the\r\nreader should always have the sensation of swimming in glue. Since his\r\nday Cecil Torr has published a clever work on the same topic; while H.\r\nS. Macran and Abdy Williams have both written on Aristoxenus.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the list of original writers, but, before leaving the\r\nsubject, a word must be spared for the vast improvement that has\r\nappeared during the past few years in the translation of foreign\r\nmusical texts into English. The value of the work of such men as Claude\r\nAveling, Frederick Jameson, and Paul England can only be appreciated by\r\na comparison of their translations with those of their predecessors.\r\nOne may add that there is now a persistent cry in the London press\r\nfor fine English finely sung, and this demand--though not always\r\ngratified--is kept before the public by such patriotic critics as Robin\r\nLegge, Edwin Evans, and Henry Cope Colles.\r\n\r\nFinally, before passing on to the third group, we may here conveniently\r\nplace together the small band of theatrical composers who have\r\nsucceeded Sullivan. Musical comedy and the money that comes from\r\nwriting it are the very sour grapes of the average English symphonist.\r\nOne and all they applaud what they call 'genuine comic opera' (meaning\r\nOffenbach or anyone else that is _old_ and _dead_), but decry its much\r\nbrighter, cleaner, and more musical descendant. The ludicrous snobbery\r\nof English life draws a wide black line between the two classes of\r\ncomposer; and the stupidest Mus. Doc. that ever drowned a choir would\r\nprobably rather have his daughter run off with the butler than marry\r\na musical comedy composer. Nine times out of ten the theatrical man's\r\nrevenge is that it is he and not the Mus. Doc. that has the butler.\r\nFor, even under present conditions, the theatre alone in England offers\r\na composer-conductor the chance of an honorable livelihood.\r\n\r\nDuring Sullivan's lifetime he and Gilbert _were_ comic opera; and,\r\nthough the Savoy cap was tried on such diversely shaped heads as\r\nA. C. Mackenzie, Ernest Ford, Edward Soloman, and J. M. Barrie,\r\nit never really fitted any of them. Cellier alone--brother of\r\nSullivan's conductor--made a success (elsewhere) with his charming\r\nwork, 'Dorothy.' We have already mentioned that, after Sir Arthur's\r\ndeath, German completed his unfinished opera, 'The Emerald Isle,' and\r\ncontinued to employ his easy brilliant talents in that field. A later\r\nattempt to run a miniature grand opera, written by an Italian (Franco\r\nLeoni) but sung in English, was defeated by the two gods of fog,\r\nmusical and meteorological.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the century theatre-land began to shift westward and\r\nnorthward into the Piccadilly Circus and Shaftesbury Avenue district.\r\nThe new form of entertainment came into its own, and--if one may quote\r\nthe words of an eminent Russian violinist--'Musical comedy at Daly's\r\nbecame the top-thing.' Of the men who have been providing the music for\r\nthe London theatres we may mention four--Jones, Monckton, Talbot, and\r\nRubens.\r\n\r\nSidney Jones's music has been played all the world over. In 'The\r\nGeisha,' 'San Toy,' and many other works he has had the opportunity\r\nof exercising his delicate taste and his really very musical mind.\r\nHe has written more than one extended finale that is a comic opera\r\nmasterpiece; while the alternate sparkle and quaint tenderness of his\r\nmelodies are quite irresistible.\r\n\r\nOf recent years Lionel Monckton has had the biggest finger in\r\nthe musical comedy pie. And deservedly so. He owes his present\r\ndistinguished position mainly to his inexhaustible fund of original\r\nmelody. Many of these tunes are, in their way, perfect. Their special\r\nexcellence is lightness, vigor, rhythmic variety and constructional\r\npower. If the present writer were subpœnaed before the Court of the\r\nMuses to give evidence as to the best tunes made in the past fifteen\r\nyears he would testify, among others, for Monckton. The Folk-Song\r\nSociety of 2500 will probably explain him as a solar-myth.\r\n\r\nHoward Talbot[81] and Paul Rubens may be bracketed together. The\r\nformer, though a New Yorker born, has lived his musical life in London.\r\nAnd his charming talent is shown in the many works of which he is\r\neither whole-or part-author. Of these the most popular are perhaps 'A\r\nChinese Honeymoon,' 'The Arcadians,' and 'The Mousmé.' Rubens may be\r\nspecially noticed for his Sullivanesque power of associating his music\r\nintimately with his literary text. Not that his music has anything\r\nin common with Sullivan's. But the special faculty of making the two\r\nthings appear one is common to both composers. Rubens nearly always\r\nwrites his own lyrics and thus, in a delightful manner, revives and\r\nvindicates the theory and practice of Greek poetic composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IV\r\n\r\nWith the turn of the century the folk-song movement had sunk deep into\r\nthe English mind, where it still rests as an anchor for many of their\r\nhopes. Accordingly in this period we find men, like Vaughan Williams,\r\nwho either base their music entirely on actual folk-song or invent\r\ntunes in close spiritual alliance with its ideals. In either case the\r\nresult is a genuine development of folk-music. On the technical side\r\nthis group is marked by a much more decided tendency to refuse the\r\nhighly organized German technique as necessary to its salvation. This\r\nagain is largely due to an open-minded reconsideration of musical\r\næsthetics, forced upon composers by the special harmonic and melodic\r\nfeatures of folk-song. The matter is too large for discussion here; but\r\nit is satisfactory to note that more than one Englishman who passed\r\nthrough his student-days with the reputation of a wrong-headed jackass\r\nhas been able to base his honor on his alleged stupidities.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years there is some change to be noted in the material\r\nside of English musical conditions. Apparently there is less love for\r\nthe oratorio; and therefore less scope for writing it. This symptom\r\nof musical life is common to America and England. It is easy to\r\ndiagnose the reasons. In England they are two: first, on the part of\r\nthe audience, the dislike of prolonged boredom; and, second, on the\r\npart of the composer, an indignant hatred of the organized corruption\r\nassociated with choral music. The latter point cannot be dealt with\r\nhere, though it is a common theme of talk among English composers. The\r\nmusician's compensation is to be found in the extraordinary system of\r\n'choral competitions' and 'festivals' which now honeycomb England with\r\ntheir sweetness. These, beginning with Miss Wakefield's celebrated\r\ngathering in Cumberland, have spread all over the country and now\r\noffer composers large opportunities for the performance of part-songs\r\nand the smaller sort of choral works. The best and highest aims of\r\nthese English festivals are summarized for Americans in the 'Norfolk\r\nFestival' of the Litchfield County Choral Union founded by Mr. and\r\nMrs. Stoeckel to honor the memory of Robbins Battell.\r\n\r\nOn the side of actual orchestral opportunity the English composer of\r\nto-day is undoubtedly more favored than his American brother. There\r\nare more orchestras there; and they are more ready to do native works.\r\nThe conditions are not perfect by any means, but they are better there\r\nthan here. As far as the publication of serious music goes the English\r\ncomposer's position is hopelessly bad. He has to contend against\r\nignorance, apathy, and a short-sighted financial timidity far beyond\r\nAmerican credence. In addition to that he often has to fight hard\r\nagainst his own seniors who--themselves comfortably off--deny that\r\nmusic, when written, has any commercial existence. A certain London\r\nfirm, in order to encourage its poorer and younger clientèle to take\r\nexample thereby, continually cites the readiness of one of its older\r\nwealthy composers to take $25 for a choral work. Words can go no\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to specify the names of the great English publishing\r\nhouses which have associated themselves with the English revival.\r\nSuffice it to say that they have always been at hand, ready to lighten\r\nthe burden and the pocket of the composer. But it would not be fair\r\nto ignore the firm of Stainer and Bell, which was founded--under a\r\ndirectorate of distinguished musicians--with the prime object of\r\ndealing honorably with the composer. The existence of this firm is,\r\nin its way, a landmark; or rather a lighthouse for composers who have\r\nlong had to beat up in the straits of chicanery and dishonesty. Nor\r\nmust we omit to mention the present extended activity of the Society\r\nof Authors. Though founded by Sir Walter Besant some fifty years ago\r\nfor the special protection of literary men, it has recently formed a\r\nsub-committee of composers under the chairmanship of Sir Charles V.\r\nStanford. It is now known as The Society of Authors, Playwrights, and\r\nComposers and, among the last-named workers, has already done valuable\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe number of composers who might be mentioned in this group is, of\r\ncourse, very large. Now that music has almost risen to the level of\r\ngolf and horse-racing as a national pastime, it employs the brains of\r\nmany. The list, we fear, must be ruthlessly pruned. But it will be\r\npruned so as to leave the more prominent branches and even some of the\r\nbuds visible to the American reader. Of his charity he may be asked\r\nto surmise what the author well knows, that some young Englishmen of\r\ngreat original powers are forced by circumstance to spend their days in\r\nteaching little girls the fiddle, while others who scarcely condescend\r\nbelow grand opera might just as well be employed on some wholly\r\nuninspired task--such as the writing of these pages.\r\n\r\nRalph Vaughan Williams--though he is the most characteristically\r\nEnglish of this group--is a Welshman. Large both in body and mind,\r\nhe has always kept before himself and his fellows a singularly noble\r\nideal. It may safely be said of him that he has never trimmed his\r\ncourse even half a point from what he considered his duty. The music\r\nthat comes from this simple and courageous mind is naturally of the\r\nmost earnest--perhaps a little awkward at times, but always deeply\r\nsincere. His aims and his outlook are peculiarly national. Let us try\r\nto exemplify this. To a fresh-water people like the Americans the\r\nattempts of Rubinstein, Wagner, and others to illustrate 'the sea' in\r\nmusic may not appear particularly unsuccessful: to a sea-loving race\r\nlike the English they are simply puny and ridiculous. Williams has\r\ntaken this subject, and, in his choral 'Sea Symphony' (words by Walt\r\nWhitman), has actually caught up the sounds of the sea as the English\r\nhear them. This is a new and a great achievement. Again in his 'London'\r\nsymphony he has somehow managed to express in sound a thing not\r\nhitherto expressed--the poetry both tragic and comic which dwells in\r\nthat most wonderful of all towns. In Williams's larger works there is\r\nalways, quite apart from their actual length, something vast, shadowy,\r\nand almost primeval. His landscape is always bathed in a pearly,\r\ntranslucent haze. The subjects loom up and disappear with a suddenness\r\nnatural in England but unnatural elsewhere. It is as if a Turner\r\ncanvas had been translated into sound. Of Williams's other works, many\r\nof which are directly inspired by the folk-music of which he is an\r\nardent collector, one may mention the orchestral 'Norfolk Rhapsodies,'\r\n'In the Fen Country,' 'Harnham Down,' and 'Boldrewood'; the 'Five\r\nMystical Songs' for baritone, chorus, and orchestra; the beautiful\r\ncantata 'Willow-wood' for baritone, female chorus, and orchestra; the\r\nsix songs, 'On Wenlock Edge,' for tenor voice, string quartet, and\r\npianoforte; and, last, his music to 'The Wasps.'\r\n\r\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912) and William Young Hurlstone\r\n(1876-1906) both died while still young. The one was an African, the\r\nother a pure Englishman. Both died leaving an example to their friends\r\nof modesty and cultured simplicity. As far as technique went they\r\ncould probably have both given Vaughan Williams ninety yards start in\r\na hundred and beaten him. But, in any more serious race, the handicap\r\nwould probably have had to be reversed. Their sailing-orders as\r\nstudents were perhaps merely to keep the ship's head on Beethoven and\r\nBrahms. But, in the case of Taylor, the powerful lode-stone of Dvořák's\r\ngenius spoilt the compass-readings and drew his ship nearer and nearer\r\nto 'the coast of Bohemia.' Of his work the best-known by far is his\r\n'Hiawatha,' the first performance of which at the R.C.M. was heard\r\nby at least three members of the first group of composers--Sullivan,\r\nStanford, and Parry. After 'Hiawatha' may be mentioned his cantata\r\n'A Tale of Old Japan,' his 'Bamboula Rhapsodic Dance' (written\r\nfor Norfolk, Conn.), and his violin 'Ballade' and 'Concerto.' In\r\nHurlstone's case a constant physical weakness prevented the true\r\ndevelopment of his really great musical powers. The best of his refined\r\nwork is found in his sonatas, trios, and quartets. Most of these have\r\nbeen or are now being published in London.\r\n\r\nJoseph Holbrooke (b. 1878) is from the land of Cockaigne. His\r\npurposeful character and his invincible habit of saying in public\r\nwhat most composers only think in private have made him the\r\n_enfant terrible_ of London musical life. In output, energy, and\r\nmaterial-command he is probably unsurpassed by any living composer.\r\nA strong, blistering style and a constant determination to call his\r\n16-inch guns into action have procured for him many (musical) enemies.\r\nHe is blessed with a great sense of humor and a very complete knowledge\r\nof the way to express it in music. His orchestral variations on 'Three\r\nBlind Mice' should be played everywhere. Holbrooke has enjoyed very\r\nexceptional opportunities in the way of dramatic performance and\r\nfull-score publication. This is not to be regretted; especially when\r\none considers the usual disadvantages of the English composer under\r\nthese two heads. He has written a large quantity of songs and chamber\r\nmusic--some of it for the most curious combinations.[82] Among his\r\nlarger works one may select his operas 'The Children of Don' and\r\n'Dylan'; his 'Queen Mab' and 'The Bells'; and his 'illuminated' choral\r\nsymphony 'Apollo and the Seaman.'\r\n\r\nPercy Grainger (b. 1883)--pianist, composer, arranger, friend of Grieg,\r\netc.--comes from Australia; and, if that country had not produced\r\nhim, the concert-agents of the world would have had to invent him.\r\nHis playing is wonderful. He never writes a dull note, and he ranges\r\nfrom the Faroe Islands to the Antipodes. He crosses no sea but as a\r\nconqueror. Folk-song is his battleship and quaint diatonic harmony his\r\nsubmarine. 'Molly on the Shore,' 'Father and Daughter,' 'Mock Morris,'\r\n'Händel in the Strand,' and 'I'm Seventeen Come Sunday' all attest the\r\n'certain liveliness' of his very happy gifts. He has been applauded\r\nby thousands and sketched by Sargent. What he will do next nobody\r\nknows--but it is sure to be successful.\r\n\r\nCyril Scott[83] was born, apparently, in the 'Yellow Book.' His slim\r\nBeardsleyesque nature seems to be always moving through an elegant\r\nexotic shadow-world, beckoned on by his own craving yet fastidious\r\nmind. At Pagani's he sits mysteriously in a black stock and cameo.\r\nA strange personality, distinguished and uneasy! Certain crippling\r\ntheories of rhythm and development have at times bent the flight of his\r\nmuse. His 'Aubade,' Pianoforte Concerto, and Ballad for baritone and\r\norchestra, 'Helen of Kirkconnell,' are notable.\r\n\r\nGustav von Holst[84] for all his name, is English born and bred.\r\nSkegness gave him to the world: he has all the energy and tenacity of\r\nthe east-coast man. The main features of his music are an extremely\r\nmodern and comprehensive method of handling his subjects, great\r\nwarmth and variety of orchestral color, and (occasionally it must be\r\nconfessed) excessive length. His successes have been striking and well\r\ndeserved. Among his best-known productions are his Moorish work 'In the\r\nStreet of the Ouled Nails,'[85] his orchestral suites 'Phantastes,' and\r\n'de Ballet,' and (more particularly) his elaborate vocal and orchestral\r\nworks, such as 'The Cloud Messenger' and 'The Mystic Trumpeter.' A\r\nlarge part of von Holst's time has been given to the composition of\r\nHindu opera on a vast scale; and, as we have already hinted, composers\r\nwho take up opera in England have to pay penalties. Among others who\r\nhave been mulcted in this way are Nicholas Gatty (with three operas,\r\n'Greysteel,' 'Duke or Devil,' and 'The Tempest'); Rutland Boughton\r\n(with his scheme of open-air choral drama on the Arthurian legends);\r\nJ. E. Barkworth (with 'Romeo and Juliet' set directly to Shakespeare's\r\ntext); George Clutsam, Colin McAlpin, and Alec Maclean.\r\n\r\nNorman O'Neill and Balfour Gardiner may be honorably mentioned as among\r\nthe very few young English composers who ever picture the Goddess of\r\nMusic as not swathed in crêpe. O'Neill's compositions are manifold.\r\nAmong the most successful are his capital numbers written as incidental\r\nmusic to 'The Blue Bird.' Gardiner has a shorter list, but all his\r\nworks have a delightfully boyish and open-air spirit. We may mention\r\nhis orchestral pieces 'English Dance,' 'Overture to a Comedy,' and\r\n'Shepherd Fennel's Dance.'\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent traits in the musical make-up of the young\r\nEnglish composer is his persistent cry for loud, complex orchestral\r\nexpression. Holbrooke was the one who started him on this trail; and\r\nnow his constant prayer seems to be:\r\n\r\n    '_O mihi si linguæ centum sint, oraque centum._'\r\n\r\nAbove this school Frank Bridge (b. 1879) stands head and shoulders.\r\nWhat the others do well he does better; and, if they ever attempt to\r\nfollow him there, he always has a 'best' waiting for them. Though he is\r\nquite unknown outside England, one has no hesitation in saying that his\r\nsuperior as a plastic orchestral artist would be hard to find. Among\r\nhis best works are his three orchestral impressions of 'The Sea,' his\r\ntwo 'Dance Rhapsodies,' and his beautiful symphonic poem 'Isabella.'\r\nIn chamber music he has been very successful, more especially in the\r\n'Fancy' or 'Phantasy' form recently revived in England. His 'Three\r\nIdylls' for string quartet are both charming and distinguished.\r\n\r\nRound Bridge's name may be grouped, for convenience of placing, the\r\nnames of York Bowen, who has written everything from symphonies and\r\nsonatas to a waltz on Strauss's _Ein Heldenleben_; A. E. T. Bax,\r\nwhose activities are in some measure the musical counterpart of the\r\n'Celtic twilight' school of poetry; W. H. Bell, the author of 'Mother\r\nCary' and the 'Walt Whitman' symphony; Hamilton Harty, whose 'Comedy\r\nOverture,' 'With the Wild Geese,' and 'The Mystic Trumpeter' are all\r\nmuch played in England; and Hubert Bath. To the last-named composer\r\nwe English owe a debt for his constant refusal to worship the muse\r\nwith a cypress-branch. His gay, sprightly choral ballads, such as\r\n'The Wedding of Shon Maclean' and 'The Jackdaw of Rheims,' bring him\r\nfriends wherever they are heard. Bath has also made a specialty of\r\naccompanied recitation-music. He has produced nearly two dozen of these\r\npieces; but in this field Stanley Hawley with his fifty-one published\r\ncompositions easily leads the way. Almost all the musicians mentioned\r\nin this paragraph have been before the public at some time or other as\r\nconductors. Harty and Bridge in particular have shown themselves to be\r\npossessed of very strong gifts in this line.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps premature to criticize the very latest swarms of\r\norchestral composers that have issued from the musical bee-hives of\r\nLondon. Certain of them, however, show considerable promise and, in\r\nsome cases, a rather alarming tendency to soar after the queen-bees of\r\ncontinental hives. This they will probably outgrow as their summer days\r\nincrease. Among the most recent to try their wings are P. R. Kirby (a\r\nScotsman from Aberdeen), Eugène Goosens, Jr. (with his symphonic poem\r\n'Perseus'), and Oskar Borsdorf (with his dramatic fantasy 'Glaucus and\r\nIone').\r\n\r\nAmong the members of the third group who have shown special excellence\r\nin the realm of chamber music B. J. Dale stands preëminent. The first\r\nperformance of his big sonata in D minor made musical London hold\r\nits breath. He has written a great deal of music for the viola (as\r\ndiscovered by Lionel Tertis), and has even defied fate by composing a\r\nwork for six violas. Dale's powers are very great, and he has probably\r\na good deal to say yet. Richard Walthew and T. F. Dunhill have both\r\nan honorable record in chamber music. Both, too, have written on the\r\ntopic. The former, who, is also a prolific song-writer, has published\r\na volume on 'The Development of Chamber Music'; while the latter, in\r\naddition to his many-sided activities, has produced a tactful treatise\r\nfor students entitled 'Chamber Music.' To the list of those who are\r\nspecially devoted to this form of composition one may add the names\r\nof J. N. Ireland and James Friskin, neither of whom has yet had an\r\nopportunity adequate to his undoubted talents.\r\n\r\nNaturally, at all times there has been a considerable literature of\r\norgan music in England. Almost all the composers mentioned above have\r\nwritten for the instrument. But, among those more specially identified\r\nwith it and with church music, are W. Wolstenholme, who has more than\r\nsixty published compositions; Ernest Halsley, also with a long list;\r\nLemare, whose transcriptions are so well known; T. Tertius Noble; C.\r\nB. Rootham; and Alan Gray. James Lyon, the Liverpool organist, has a\r\nlengthy record of the most varied sort, from orchestral, vocal, and\r\norgan works to church services and technical treatises. A. M. Goodhart,\r\nof Eton, has a similar weighty basketful. He has made a specialty of\r\nthe 'choral ballad.'\r\n\r\nWe have already given the names of many English song writers. Here\r\nthere are two groups of Richmonds in the field; those who write for the\r\nshop-ballad public, and those who do not. Most of the 'do nots' have\r\nnaturally already been dealt with among the more serious composers;\r\nthough the two spheres of activity by no means always coincide. The\r\nfollowing short list--covering practically three generations--includes\r\nsome of both sorts, but excludes the names of composers already\r\nmentioned: Stephen Adams, Frances Allitsen, Robert Batten, A. von Ahn\r\nCarse, Coningsby Clarke, Eric Coates, Noel Johnson, Frank Lambert,\r\nLiza Lehmann, Herman Löhr, Daisy McGeoch, Alicia A. Needham, Montague\r\nPhillips, John Pointer, Roger Quilter, Landon Ronald (principal of\r\nthe Guildhall School of Music), Wilfred Sanderson, W. H. Squire, Hope\r\nTemple, Maude V. White, Haydn Wood, and Amy Woodforde-Finden.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this highly compressed sketch of the English musical\r\nrenaissance an apology must be made for a double omission. First, the\r\nwhole subject of English opera has been ignored as too complex and\r\ndifficult for treatment. The activities of Carl Rosa, Moody-Manners,\r\nBeecham, and others have therefore to be left almost unnoticed. Second,\r\nno list has been attempted of the many fine executants produced by\r\nEngland in the past generation. In actual accomplishment some of these\r\nhave been second to none in the world; though unfortunately their\r\nconnection with the men of the English revival has often been slight\r\nor non-existent. On the other hand, some of the first of these artists\r\nhave stood, and do now stand, in a very close relationship with the\r\ncomposers. And this mutual sympathy has often had happy results. One\r\ncan scarcely imagine Stanford's Irish songs without Mr. Plunket Greene\r\nto sing them.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has travelled so far with the author should have by\r\nnow a fairly clear idea of musical conditions and achievements on the\r\nother side. It is hoped that he will not regard his experiences merely\r\nas a forty-five-years' sojourn 'in darkest England.' He can take the\r\nwriter's word for it that there is plenty of light shining there. But,\r\nwhat with the fogs in the North Sea, the Channel, and the Atlantic, the\r\nrays seldom get beyond the coastguard.\r\n\r\n                                                            C.
