He had lived his\r\nlife, made a little money and spent it all, as every good Hindu should\r\ndo, on a work of piety--the Chubara. That was full of brick cells, gaily\r\npainted with the figures of Gods and kings and elephants, where worn-out\r\npriests could sit and meditate on the latter end of things; the paths\r\nwere brick paved, and the naked feet of thousands had worn them into\r\ngutters. Clumps of mangoes sprouted from between the bricks; great\r\npipal trees overhung the well-windlass that whined all day; and hosts\r\nof parrots tore through the trees. Crows and squirrels were tame in that\r\nplace, for they knew that never a priest would touch them.\r\n\r\nThe wandering mendicants, charm-sellers, and holy vagabonds for a\r\nhundred miles round used to make the Chubara their place of call and\r\nrest. Mahomedan, Sikh, and Hindu mixed equally under the trees. They\r\nwere old men, and when man has come to the turnstiles of Night all the\r\ncreeds in the world seem to him wonderfully alike and colourless.\r\n\r\nGobind the one-eyed told me this. He was a holy man who lived on an\r\nisland in the middle of a river and fed the fishes with little bread\r\npellets twice a day. In flood-time, when swollen corpses stranded\r\nthemselves at the foot of the island, Gobind would cause them to be\r\npiously burned, for the sake of the honour of mankind, and having regard\r\nto his own account with God hereafter. But when two-thirds of the\r\nisland was torn away in a spate, Gobind came across the river to Dhunni\r\nBhagat’s Chubara, he and his brass drinking vessel with the well-cord\r\nround the neck, his short arm-rest crutch studded with brass nails, his\r\nroll of bedding, his big pipe, his umbrella, and his tall sugar-loaf hat\r\nwith the nodding peacock feathers in it. He wrapped himself up in his\r\npatched quilt made of every colour and material in the world, sat down\r\nin a sunny corner of the very quiet Chubara, and, resting his arm on his\r\nshort-handled crutch, waited for death. The people brought him food and\r\nlittle clumps of marigold flowers, and he gave his blessing in return.\r\nHe was nearly blind, and his face was seamed and lined and wrinkled\r\nbeyond belief, for he had lived in his time which was before the English\r\ncame within five hundred miles of Dhunni Bhagat’s Chubara.\r\n\r\nWhen we grew to know each other well, Gobind would tell me tales in a\r\nvoice most like the rumbling of heavy guns over a wooden bridge. His\r\ntales were true, but not one in twenty could be printed in an English\r\nbook, because the English do not think as natives do. They brood over\r\nmatters that a native would dismiss till a fitting occasion; and what\r\nthey would not think twice about a native will brood over till a fitting\r\noccasion: then native and English stare at each other hopelessly across\r\ngreat gulfs of miscomprehension.\r\n\r\n‘And what,’ said Gobind one Sunday evening, ‘is your honoured craft, and\r\nby what manner of means earn you your daily bread?’\r\n\r\n‘I am,’ said I, ‘a kerani--one who writes with a pen upon paper, not\r\nbeing in the service of the Government.’\r\n\r\n‘Then what do you write?’ said Gobind. ‘Come nearer, for I cannot see\r\nyour countenance, and the light fails.’\r\n\r\n‘I write of all matters that lie within my understanding, and of many\r\nthat do not. But chiefly I write of Life and Death, and men and women,\r\nand Love and Fate according to the measure of my ability, telling the\r\ntale through the mouths of one, two, or more people. Then by the favour\r\nof God the tales are sold and money accrues to me that I may keep\r\nalive.’\r\n\r\n‘Even so,’ said Gobind. ‘That is the work of the bazar story-teller; but\r\nhe speaks straight to men and women and does not write anything at all.\r\nOnly when the tale has aroused expectation, and calamities are about\r\nto befall the virtuous, he stops suddenly and demands payment ere he\r\ncontinues the narration. Is it so in your craft, my son?’\r\n\r\n‘I have heard of such things when a tale is of great length, and is sold\r\nas a cucumber, in small pieces.’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, I was once a famed teller of stories when I was begging on the road\r\nbetween Koshin and Etra; before the last pilgrimage that ever I took to\r\nOrissa. I told many tales and heard many more at the rest-houses in the\r\nevening when we were merry at the end of the march. It is in my heart\r\nthat grown men are but as little children in the matter of tales, and\r\nthe oldest tale is the most beloved.’\r\n\r\n‘With your people that is truth,’ said I. ‘But in regard to our people\r\nthey desire new tales, and when all is written they rise up and declare\r\nthat the tale were better told in such and such a manner, and doubt\r\neither the truth or the invention thereof.’\r\n\r\n‘But what folly is theirs!’ said Gobind, throwing out his knotted hand.\r\n‘A tale that is told is a true tale as long as the telling lasts. And\r\nof their talk upon it--you know how Bilas Khan, that was the prince of\r\ntale-tellers, said to one who mocked him in the great rest-house on the\r\nJhelum road: “Go on, my brother, and finish that I have begun,” and he\r\nwho mocked took up the tale, but having neither voice nor manner for the\r\ntask came to a standstill, and the pilgrims at supper made him eat abuse\r\nand stick half that night.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, but with our people, money having passed, it is their right; as we\r\nshould turn against a shoeseller in regard to shoes if those wore out.\r\nIf ever I make a book you shall see and judge.’\r\n\r\n‘And the parrot said to the falling tree, Wait, brother, till I fetch a\r\nprop!’ said Gobind with a grim chuckle. ‘God has given me eighty years,\r\nand it may be some over. I cannot look for more than day granted by day\r\nand as a favour at this tide. Be swift.’\r\n\r\n‘In what manner is it best to set about the task.’ said I, ‘O chiefest\r\nof those who string pearls with their tongue?’\r\n\r\n‘How do I know? Yet’--he thought for a little--‘how should I not know?\r\nGod has made very many heads, but there is only one heart in all the\r\nworld among your people or my people. They are children in the matter of\r\ntales.’\r\n\r\n‘But none are so terrible as the little ones, if a man misplace a word,\r\nor in a second telling vary events by so much as one small devil.’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, I also have told tales to the little ones, but do thou this--’ His\r\nold eyes fell on the gaudy paintings of the wall, the blue and red dome,\r\nand the flames of the poinsettias beyond. ‘Tell them first of those\r\nthings that thou hast seen and they have seen together. Thus their\r\nknowledge will piece out thy imperfections. Tell them of what thou alone\r\nhast seen, then what thou hast heard, and since they be children tell\r\nthem of battles and kings, horses, devils, elephants, and angels, but\r\nomit not to tell them of love and suchlike. All the earth is full of\r\ntales to him who listens and does not drive away the poor from his door.\r\nThe poor are the best of tale-tellers; for they must lay their ear to\r\nthe ground every night.’\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation the idea grew in my head, and Gobind was\r\npressing in his inquiries as to the health of the book.\r\n\r\nLater, when we had been parted for months, it happened that I was to go\r\naway and far off, and I came to bid Gobind good-bye.\r\n\r\n‘It is farewell between us now, for I go a very long journey,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘And I also. A longer one than thou. But what of the book?’ said he.\r\n\r\n‘It will be born in due season if it is so ordained.’\r\n\r\n‘I would I could see it,’ said the old man, huddling beneath his quilt.\r\n‘But that will not be. I die three days hence, in the night, a little\r\nbefore the dawn. The term of my years is accomplished.’\r\n\r\nIn nine cases out of ten a native makes no miscalculation as to the day\r\nof his death. He has the foreknowledge of the beasts in this respect.\r\n\r\n‘Then thou wilt depart in peace, and it is good talk, for thou hast said\r\nthat life is no delight to thee.’\r\n\r\n‘But it is a pity that our book is not born. How shall I know that there\r\nis any record of my name?’\r\n\r\n‘Because I promise, in the forepart of the book, preceding everything\r\nelse, that it shall be written, Gobind, sadhu, of the island in the\r\nriver and awaiting God in Dhunni Bhagat’s Chubara, first spoke of the\r\nbook,’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘And gave counsel--an old man’s counsel. Gobind, son of Gobind of the\r\nChumi village in the Karaon tehsil, in the district of Mooltan. Will\r\nthat be written also?’\r\n\r\n‘That will be written also.’\r\n\r\n‘And the book will go across the Black Water to the houses of your\r\npeople, and all the Sahibs will know of me who am eighty years old?’\r\n\r\n‘All who read the book shall know. I cannot promise for the rest.’\r\n\r\n‘That is good talk. Call aloud to all who are in the monastery, and I\r\nwill tell them this thing.’\r\n\r\nThey trooped up, faquirs, sadhus, sunnyasis, byragis, nihangs, and\r\nmullahs, priests of all faiths and every degree of raggedness, and\r\nGobind, leaning upon his crutch, spoke so that they were visibly filled\r\nwith envy, and a white-haired senior bade Gobind think of his latter\r\nend instead of transitory repute in the mouths of strangers. Then Gobind\r\ngave me his blessing and I came away.\r\n\r\nThese tales have been collected from all places, and all sorts of\r\npeople, from priests in the Chubara, from Ala Yar the carver, Jiwun\r\nSingh the carpenter, nameless men on steamers and trains round the\r\nworld, women spinning outside their cottages in the twilight, officers\r\nand gentlemen now dead and buried, and a few, but these are the very\r\nbest, my father gave me. The greater part of them have been published in\r\nmagazines and newspapers, to whose editors I am indebted; but some are\r\nnew on this side of the water, and some have not seen the light before.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable stories are, of course, those which do not\r\nappear--for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANG MEN O’ LARUT\r\n\r\nREINGELDER AND THE GERMAN FLAG\r\n\r\nTHE WANDERING JEW\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE FIRE\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCES OF THE GODS\r\n\r\nTHE AMIR’S HOMILY\r\n\r\nJEWS IN SHUSHAN\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITATIONS OF PAMBE SERANG\r\n\r\nLITTLE TOBRAH\r\n\r\nBUBBLING WELL ROAD\r\n\r\n‘THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT’\r\n\r\nGEORGIE PORGIE\r\n\r\nNABOTH\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM OF DUNCAN PARRENNESS\r\n\r\nTHE INCARNATION OF KRISHNA MULVANEY\r\n\r\nTHE COURTING OF DINAH SHADD\r\n\r\nON GREENHOW HILL\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO WAS\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD OF THE DISTRICT\r\n\r\nWITHOUT BENEFIT OF CLERGY\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF THE PASSAGE\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINY OF THE MAVERICKS\r\n\r\nTHE MARK OF THE BEAST\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF IMRAY\r\n\r\nNAMGAY DOOLA\r\n\r\nBERTRAN AND BIMI\r\n\r\nMOTI GUJ--MUTINEER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANG MEN O’ LARUT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & CO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chief Engineer’s sleeping suit was of yellow striped with blue, and\r\nhis speech was the speech of Aberdeen. They sluiced the deck under him,\r\nand he hopped on to the ornamental capstan, a black pipe between his\r\nteeth, though the hour was not seven of the morn.\r\n\r\n‘Did you ever hear o’ the Lang Men o’ Larut?’ he asked when the Man from\r\nOrizava had finished a story of an aboriginal giant discovered in the\r\nwilds of Brazil. There was never story yet passed the lips of teller,\r\nbut the Man from Orizava could cap it.\r\n\r\n‘No, we never did,’ we responded with one voice. The Man from Orizava\r\nwatched the Chief keenly, as a possible rival.\r\n\r\n‘I’m not telling the story for the sake of talking merely,’ said the\r\nChief, ‘but as a warning against betting, unless you bet on a perrfect\r\ncertainty. The Lang Men o’ Larut were just a certainty. I have had talk\r\nwi’ them. Now Larut, you will understand, is a dependency, or it may be\r\nan outlying possession, o’ the island o’ Penang, and there they will get\r\nyou tin and manganese, an’ it mayhap mica, and all manner o’ meenerals.\r\nLarut is a great place.’\r\n\r\n‘But what about the population?’ said the Man from Orizava.\r\n\r\n‘The population,’ said the Chief slowly, ‘were few but enorrmous. You\r\nmust understand that, exceptin’ the tin-mines, there is no special\r\ninducement to Europeans to reside in Larut. The climate is warm and\r\nremarkably like the climate o’ Calcutta; and in regard to Calcutta, it\r\ncannot have escaped your obsairvation that--’\r\n\r\n‘Calcutta isn’t Larut; and we’ve only just come from it,’ protested\r\nthe Man from Orizava. ‘There’s a meteorological department in Calcutta,\r\ntoo.’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, but there’s no meteorological department in Larut. Each man is a\r\nlaw to himself. Some drink whisky, and some drink brandipanee, and\r\nsome drink cocktails--vara bad for the coats o’ the stomach is a\r\ncocktail--and some drink sangaree, so I have been credibly informed;\r\nbut one and all they sweat like the packing of piston-head on a\r\nfourrteen-days’ voyage with the screw racing half her time. But, as I\r\nwas saying, the population o’ Larut was five all told of English--that\r\nis to say, Scotch--an’ I’m Scotch, ye know,’ said the Chief.\r\n\r\nThe Man from Orizava lit another cigarette, and waited patiently. It was\r\nhopeless to hurry the Chief Engineer.\r\n\r\n‘I am not pretending to account for the population o’ Larut being\r\nlaid down according to such fabulous dimensions. O’ the five white men\r\nengaged upon the extraction o’ tin ore and mercantile pursuits, there\r\nwere three o’ the sons o’ Anak. Wait while I remember. Lammitter was the\r\nfirst by two inches--a giant in the land, an’ a terreefic man to\r\ncross in his ways. From heel to head he was six feet nine inches, and\r\nproportionately built across and through the thickness of his body.\r\nSix good feet nine inches--an overbearin’ man. Next to him, and I have\r\nforgotten his precise business, was Sandy Vowle. And he was six feet\r\nseven, but lean and lathy, and it was more in the elasteecity of his\r\nneck that the height lay than in any honesty o’ bone and sinew. Five\r\nfeet and a few odd inches may have been his real height. The remainder\r\ncame out when he held up his head, and six feet seven he was upon the\r\ndoor-sills. I took his measure in chalk standin’ on a chair. And next\r\nto him, but a proportionately made man, ruddy and of a fair countenance,\r\nwas Jock Coan--that they called the Fir Cone. He was but six feet\r\nfive, and a child beside Lammitter and Vowle. When the three walked\r\nout together, they made a scunner run through the colony o’ Larut. The\r\nMalays ran round them as though they had been the giant trees in\r\nthe Yosemite Valley--these three Lang Men o’ Larut. It was perfectly\r\nridiculous--a lusus naturae--that one little place should have contained\r\nmaybe the three tallest ordinar’ men upon the face o’ the earth.\r\n\r\n‘Obsairve now the order o’ things. For it led to the finest big drink in\r\nLarut, and six sore heads the morn that endured for a week. I am against\r\nimmoderate liquor, but the event to follow was a justification. You must\r\nunderstand that many coasting steamers call at Larut wi’ strangers o’\r\nthe mercantile profession. In the spring time, when the young cocoanuts\r\nwere ripening, and the trees o’ the forests were putting forth their\r\nleaves, there came an American man to Larut, and he was six foot three,\r\nor it may have been four, in his stockings. He came on business from\r\nSacramento, but he stayed for pleasure wi’ the Lang Men o’ Larut. Less\r\nthan, a half o’ the population were ordinar’ in their girth and stature,\r\nye will understand--Howson and Nailor, merchants, five feet nine or\r\nthereabouts. He had business with those two, and he stood above them\r\nfrom the six feet threedom o’ his height till they went to drink. In\r\nthe course o’ conversation he said, as tall men will, things about his\r\nheight, and the trouble of it to him. That was his pride o’ the flesh.\r\n\r\n‘“As the longest man in the island--” he said, but there they took him\r\nup and asked if he were sure.\r\n\r\n‘“I say I am the longest man in the island,” he said, “and on that I’ll\r\nbet my substance.”\r\n\r\n‘They laid down the bed-plates of a big drink then and there, and put\r\nit aside while they called Jock Coan from his house, near by among the\r\nfireflies’ winking.\r\n\r\n‘“How’s a’ wi’ you?” said Jock, and came in by the side o’ the\r\nSacramento profligate, two inches, or it may have been one, taller than\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n‘“You’re long,” said the man, opening his eyes. “But I am longer.” An’\r\nthey sent a whistle through the night an’ howkit out Sandy Vowle from\r\nhis bit bungalow, and he came in an’ stood by the side o’ Jock, an’ the\r\npair just fillit the room to the ceiling-cloth.\r\n\r\n‘The Sacramento man was a euchre-player and a most profane sweerer. “You\r\nhold both Bowers,” he said, “but the Joker is with me.”\r\n\r\n‘“Fair an’ softly,” says Nailor. “Jock, whaur’s Lang Lammitter?”\r\n\r\n‘“Here,” says that man, putting his leg through the window and coming\r\nin like an anaconda o’ the desert furlong by furlong, one foot in Penang\r\nand one in Batavia, and a hand in North Borneo it may be.\r\n\r\n‘“Are you suited?” said Nailor, when the hinder end o’ Lang Lammitter\r\nwas slidden through the sill an’ the head of Lammitter was lost in the\r\nsmoke away above.\r\n\r\n‘The American man took out his card and put it on the table. “Esdras B.\r\nLonger is my name, America is my nation, ‘Frisco is my resting-place,\r\nbut this here beats Creation,” said he. “Boys, giants--side-show\r\ngiants--I minded to slide out of my bet if I had been overtopped, on the\r\nstrength of the riddle on this paste-board. I would have done it if\r\nyou had topped me even by three inches, but when it comes to\r\nfeet--yards--miles, I am not the man to shirk the biggest drink that\r\never made the travellers’-joy palm blush with virginal indignation, or\r\nthe orang-outang and the perambulating dyak howl with envy. Set them up\r\nand continue till the final conclusion.”\r\n\r\n‘O mon, I tell you ‘twas an awful sight to see those four giants\r\nthreshing about the house and the island, and tearin’ down the pillars\r\nthereof an’ throwing palm-trees broadcast, and currling their long legs\r\nround the hills o’ Larut. An awfu’ sight! I was there. I did not mean to\r\ntell you, but it’s out now. I was not overcome, for I e’en sat me down\r\nunder the pieces o’ the table at four the morn an’ meditated upon the\r\nstrangeness of things.\r\n\r\n‘Losh, yon’s the breakfast-bell!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREINGELDER AND THE GERMAN FLAG\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN\r\n& CO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHans Breitmann paddled across the deck in his pink pyjamas, a cup of tea\r\nin one hand and a cheroot in the other, when the steamer was sweltering\r\ndown the coast on her way to Singapur. He drank beer all day and all\r\nnight, and played a game called ‘Scairt’ with three compatriots.\r\n\r\n‘I haf washed,’ said he in a voice of thunder, ‘but dere is no\r\nuse washing on these hell-seas. Look at me--I am still all wet and\r\nschweatin’. It is der tea dot makes me so. Boy, bring me Bilsener on\r\nice.’\r\n\r\n‘You will die if you drink beer before breakfast,’ said one man. ‘Beer\r\nis the worst thing in the world for--’\r\n\r\n‘Ya, I know--der liver. I haf no liver, und I shall not die. At least I\r\nwill not die obon dese benny sdeamers dot haf no beer fit to trink. If\r\nI should haf died, I will haf don so a hoondert dimes before now--in\r\nShermany, in New York, in Japon, in Assam, und all over der inside bans\r\nof South Amerique. Also in Shamaica should I hat died or in Siam, but I\r\nam here; und der are my orchits dot I have drafelled all the vorld round\r\nto find.’\r\n\r\nHe pointed towards the wheel, where, in two rough wooden boxes, lay a\r\nmass of shrivelled vegetation, supposed by all the ship to represent\r\nAssam orchids of fabulous value.\r\n\r\nNow, orchids do not grow in the main streets of towns, and Hans\r\nBreitmann had gone far to get his. There was nothing that he had not\r\ncollected that year, from king-crabs to white kangaroos.\r\n\r\n‘Lisden now,’ said he, after he had been speaking for not much more than\r\nten minutes without a pause; ‘Lisden und I will dell you a sdory to show\r\nhow bad und worse it is to go gollectin’ und belief vot anoder fool haf\r\nsaid. Dis was in Uraguay which was in Amerique--North or Sout’ you would\r\nnot know--und I was hoontin’ orchits und aferydings else dot I could\r\nback in my kanasters--dot is drafelling sbecimen-gaces.

In after years John Hay went\r\neast, west, north, and south, transacted business, made love, and begat\r\na family, as have done many men, and the scientific information above\r\nrecorded lay neglected in the deeps of his mind with a thousand other\r\nmatters of equal importance.\r\n\r\nWhen a rich relative died, he found himself wealthy beyond any\r\nreasonable expectation that he had entertained in his previous career,\r\nwhich had been a chequered and evil one. Indeed, long before the legacy\r\ncame to him, there existed in the brain of John Hay a little cloud-a\r\nmomentary obscuration of thought that came and went almost before he\r\ncould realize that there was any solution of continuity. So do the bats\r\nflit round the eaves of a house to show that the darkness is falling. He\r\nentered upon great possessions, in money, land, and houses; but behind\r\nhis delight stood a ghost that cried out that his enjoyment of these\r\nthings should not be of long duration. It was the ghost of the rich\r\nrelative, who had been permitted to return to earth to torture his\r\nnephew into the grave. Wherefore, under the spur of this constant\r\nreminder, John Hay, always preserving the air of heavy business-like\r\nstolidity that hid the shadow on his mind, turned investments, houses,\r\nand lands into sovereigns---rich, round, red, English sovereigns, each\r\none worth twenty shillings. Lands may become valueless, and houses fly\r\nheavenward on the wings of red flame, but till the Day of Judgment\r\na sovereign will always be a sovereign--that is to say, a king of\r\npleasures.\r\n\r\nPossessed of his sovereigns, John Hay would fain have spent them one by\r\none on such coarse amusements as his soul loved; but he was haunted by\r\nthe instant fear of Death; for the ghost of his relative stood in the\r\nhall of his house close to the hat-rack, shouting up the stairway that\r\nlife was short, that there was no hope of increase of days, and that the\r\nundertakers were already roughing out his nephew’s coffin. John Hay was\r\ngenerally alone in the house, and even when he had company, his friends\r\ncould not hear the clamorous uncle. The shadow inside his brain grew\r\nlarger and blacker. His fear of death was driving John Hay mad.\r\n\r\nThen, from the deeps of his mind, where he had stowed away all his\r\ndiscarded information, rose to light the scientific fact of the Easterly\r\njourney. On the next occasion that his uncle shouted up the stairway\r\nurging him to make haste and live, a shriller voice cried, ‘Who goes\r\nround the world once easterly, gains one day.’\r\n\r\nHis growing diffidence and distrust of mankind made John Hay unwilling\r\nto give this precious message of hope to his friends. They might take\r\nit up and analyse it. He was sure it was true, but it would pain him\r\nacutely were rough hands to examine it too closely. To him alone of all\r\nthe toiling generations of mankind had the secret of immortality\r\nbeen vouchsafed. It would be impious--against all the designs of the\r\nCreator--to set mankind hurrying eastward. Besides, this would crowd the\r\nsteamers inconveniently, and John Hay wished of all things to be alone.\r\nIf he could get round the world in two months--some one of whom he had\r\nread, he could not remember the name, had covered the passage in eighty\r\ndays--he would gain a clear day; and by steadily continuing to do it for\r\nthirty years, would gain one hundred and eighty days, or nearly the half\r\nof a year. It would not be much, but in course of time, as civilisation\r\nadvanced, and the Euphrates Valley Railway was opened, he could improve\r\nthe pace.\r\n\r\nArmed with many sovereigns, John Hay, in the thirty-fifth year of his\r\nage, set forth on his travels, two voices bearing him company from\r\nDover as he sailed to Calais. Fortune favoured him. The Euphrates Valley\r\nRailway was newly opened, and he was the first man who took ticket\r\ndirect from Calais to Calcutta--thirteen days in the train. Thirteen\r\ndays in the train are not good for the nerves; but he covered the world\r\nand returned to Calais from America in twelve days over the two months,\r\nand started afresh with four and twenty hours of precious time to his\r\ncredit. Three years passed, and John Hay religiously went round this\r\nearth seeking for more time wherein to enjoy the remainder of his\r\nsovereigns. He became known on many lines as the man who wanted to go\r\non; when people asked him what he was and what he did, he answered--\r\n\r\n‘I’m the person who intends to live, and I am trying to do it now.’\r\n\r\nHis days were divided between watching the white wake spinning behind\r\nthe stern of the swiftest steamers, or the brown earth flashing past\r\nthe windows of the fastest trains; and he noted in a pocket-book every\r\nminute that he had railed or screwed out of remorseless eternity.\r\n\r\n‘This is better than praying for long life,’ quoth John Hay as he turned\r\nhis face eastward for his twentieth trip. The years had done more for\r\nhim than he dared to hope.\r\n\r\nBy the extension of the Brahmaputra Valley line to meet the\r\nnewly-developed China Midland, the Calais railway ticket held good via\r\nKarachi and Calcutta to Hongkong. The round trip could be managed in a\r\nfraction over forty-seven days, and, filled with fatal exultation,\r\nJohn Hay told the secret of his longevity to his only friend, the\r\nhouse-keeper of his rooms in London. He spoke and passed; but the woman\r\nwas one of resource, and immediately took counsel with the lawyers who\r\nhad first informed John Hay of his golden legacy. Very many sovereigns\r\nstill remained, and another Hay longed to spend them on things more\r\nsensible than railway tickets and steamer accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe chase was long, for when a man is journeying literally for the dear\r\nlife, he does not tarry upon the road. Round the world Hay swept anew,\r\nand overtook the wearied Doctor, who had been sent out to look for him,\r\nin Madras. It was there that he found the reward of his toil and the\r\nassurance of a blessed immortality. In half an hour the Doctor, watching\r\nalways the parched lips, the shaking hands, and the eye that turned\r\neternally to the east, won John Hay to rest in a little house close to\r\nthe Madras surf. All that Hay need do was to hang by ropes from the roof\r\nof the room and let the round earth swing free beneath him. This was\r\nbetter than steamer or train, for he gained a day in a day, and was\r\nthus the equal of the undying sun. The other Hay would pay his expenses\r\nthroughout eternity.\r\n\r\n It is true that we cannot yet take tickets from Calais to Hongkong,\r\nthough that will come about in fifteen years; but men say that if you\r\nwander along the southern coast of India you shall find in a neatly\r\nwhitewashed little bungalow, sitting in a chair swung from the\r\nroof, over a sheet of thin steel which he knows so well destroys the\r\nattraction of the earth, an old and worn man who for ever faces the\r\nrising sun, a stop-watch in his hand, racing against eternity. He cannot\r\ndrink, he does not smoke, and his living expenses amount to perhaps\r\ntwenty-five rupees a month, but he is John Hay, the Immortal. Without,\r\nhe hears the thunder of the wheeling world with which he is careful to\r\nexplain he has no connection whatever; but if you say that it is only\r\nthe noise of the surf, he will cry bitterly, for the shadow on his brain\r\nis passing away as the brain ceases to work, and he doubts sometimes\r\nwhether the doctor spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n‘Why does not the sun always remain over my head?’ asks John Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Policeman rode through the Himalayan forest, under the moss-draped\r\noaks, and his orderly trotted after him.\r\n\r\n‘It’s an ugly business, Bhere Singh,’ said the Policeman. ‘Where are\r\nthey?’\r\n\r\n‘It is a very ugly business,’ said Bhere Singh; ‘and as for THEM,\r\nthey are, doubtless, now frying in a hotter fire than was ever made of\r\nspruce-branches.’\r\n\r\n‘Let us hope not,’ said the Policeman, ‘for, allowing for the difference\r\nbetween race and race, it’s the story of Francesca da Rimini, Bhere\r\nSingh.’\r\n\r\nBhere Singh knew nothing about Francesca da Rimini, so he held his peace\r\nuntil they came to the charcoal-burners’ clearing where the dying flames\r\nsaid ‘whit, whit, whit’ as they fluttered and whispered over the white\r\nashes. It must have been a great fire when at full height. Men had seen\r\nit at Donga Pa across the valley winking and blazing through the night,\r\nand said that the charcoal-burners of Kodru were getting drunk. But\r\nit was only Suket Singh, Sepoy of the load Punjab Native Infantry, and\r\nAthira, a woman, burning--burning--burning.\r\n\r\nThis was how things befell; and the Policeman’s Diary will bear me out.\r\n\r\nAthira was the wife of Madu, who was a charcoal-burner, one-eyed and\r\nof a malignant disposition. A week after their marriage, he beat Athira\r\nwith a heavy stick. A month later, Suket Singh, Sepoy, came that way to\r\nthe cool hills on leave from his regiment, and electrified the villagers\r\nof Kodru with tales of service and glory under the Government, and the\r\nhonour in which he, Suket Singh, was held by the Colonel Sahib Bahadur.\r\nAnd Desdemona listened to Othello as Desdemonas have done all the world\r\nover, and, as she listened, she loved.\r\n\r\n‘I’ve a wife of my own,’ said Suket Singh, ‘though that is no matter\r\nwhen you come to think of it. I am also due to return to my regiment\r\nafter a time, and I cannot be a deserter--I who intend to be Havildar.’\r\nThere is no Himalayan version of ‘I could not love thee, dear, as much,\r\nLoved I not Honour more;’ but Suket Singh came near to making one.\r\n\r\n‘Never mind,’ said Athira, ‘stay with me, and, if Madu tries to beat me,\r\nyou beat him.’\r\n\r\n‘Very good,’ said Suket Singh; and he beat Madu severely, to the delight\r\nof all the charcoal-burners of Kodru.\r\n\r\n‘That is enough,’ said Suket Singh, as he rolled Madu down the hillside.\r\n‘Now we shall have peace.’ But Madu crawled up the grass slope again,\r\nand hovered round his hut with angry eyes.\r\n\r\n‘He’ll kill me dead,’ said Athira to Suket Singh. ‘You must take me\r\naway.’\r\n\r\n‘There’ll be a trouble in the Lines. My wife will pull out my beard; but\r\nnever mind,’ said Suket Singh, ‘I will take you.’\r\n\r\nThere was loud trouble in the Lines, and Suket Singh’s beard was pulled,\r\nand Suket Singh’s wife went to live with her mother and took away the\r\nchildren. ‘That’s all right,’ said Athira; and Suket Singh said, ‘Yes,\r\nthat’s all right.’\r\n\r\nSo there was only Madu left in the hut that looks across the valley to\r\nDonga Pa; and, since the beginning of time, no one has had any sympathy\r\nfor husbands so unfortunate as Madu.\r\n\r\nHe went to Juseen Daze, the wizard-man who keeps the Talking Monkey’s\r\nHead.\r\n\r\n‘Get me back my wife,’ said Madu.\r\n\r\n‘I can’t,’ said Juseen Daze, ‘until you have made the Sutlej in the\r\nvalley run up the Donga Pa.’\r\n\r\n‘No riddles,’ said Madu, and he shook his hatchet above Juseen Daze’s\r\nwhite head.\r\n\r\n‘Give all your money to the headmen of the village,’ said Juseen Daze;\r\n‘and they will hold a communal Council, and the Council will send a\r\nmessage that your wife must come back.’\r\n\r\nSo Madu gave up all his worldly wealth, amounting to twenty-seven\r\nrupees, eight annas, three pice, and a silver chain, to the Council of\r\nKodru. And it fell as Juseen Daze foretold.\r\n\r\nThey sent Athira’s brother down into Suket Singh’s regiment to call\r\nAthira home. Suket Singh kicked him once round the Lines, and then\r\nhanded him over to the Havildar, who beat him with a belt.\r\n\r\n‘Come back,’ yelled Athira’s brother.\r\n\r\n‘Where to?’ said Athira.\r\n\r\n‘To Madu,’ said he.\r\n\r\n‘Never,’ said she.\r\n\r\n‘Then Juseen Daze will send a curse, and you will wither away like a\r\nbarked tree in the springtime,’ said Athira’s brother. Athira slept over\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nNext morning she had rheumatism. ‘I am beginning to wither away like a\r\nbarked tree in the springtime,’ she said. ‘That is the curse of Juseen\r\nDaze.’\r\n\r\nAnd she really began to wither away because her heart was dried up with\r\nfear, and those who believe in curses die from curses. Suket Singh, too,\r\nwas afraid because he loved Athira better than his very life. Two months\r\npassed, and Athira’s brother stood outside the regimental Lines again\r\nand yelped, ‘Aha! You are withering away. Come back.’\r\n\r\n‘I will come back,’ said Athira.\r\n\r\n‘Say rather that WE will come back,’ said Suket Singh.\r\n\r\n‘Ai; but when?’ said Athira’s brother.\r\n\r\n‘Upon a day very early in the morning,’ said Suket Singh; and he tramped\r\noff to apply to the Colonel Sahib Bahadur for one week’s leave.\r\n\r\n‘I am withering away like a barked tree in the spring,’ moaned Athira.\r\n\r\n‘You will be better soon,’ said Suket Singh; and he told her what was\r\nin his heart, and the two laughed together softly, for they loved each\r\nother. But Athira grew better from that hour.\r\n\r\nThey went away together, travelling third-class by train as the\r\nregulations provided, and then in a cart to the low hills, and on foot\r\nto the high ones. Athira sniffed the scent of the pines of her own\r\nhills, the wet Himalayan hills. ‘It is good to be alive,’ said Athira.\r\n\r\n‘Hah!’ said Suket Singh. ‘Where is the Kodru road and where is the\r\nForest Ranger’s house?’...\r\n\r\n‘It cost forty rupees twelve years ago,’ said the Forest Ranger, handing\r\nthe gun.\r\n\r\n‘Here are twenty,’ said Suket Singh, ‘and you must give me the best\r\nbullets.’\r\n\r\n‘It is very good to be alive,’ said Athira wistfully, sniffing the scent\r\nof the pine-mould; and they waited till the night had fallen upon Kodru\r\nand the Donga Pa. Madu had stacked the dry wood for the next day’s\r\ncharcoal-burning on the spur above his house. ‘It is courteous in Madu\r\nto save us this trouble,’ said Suket Singh as he stumbled on the pile,\r\nwhich was twelve foot square and four high. ‘We must wait till the moon\r\nrises.’\r\n\r\nWhen the moon rose, Athira knelt upon the pile. ‘If it were only a\r\nGovernment Snider,’ said Suket Singh ruefully, squinting down the\r\nwire-bound barrel of the Forest Ranger’s gun.\r\n\r\n‘Be quick,’ said Athira; and Suket Singh was quick; but Athira was quick\r\nno longer. Then he lit the pile at the four corners and climbed on to\r\nit, re-loading the gun.\r\n\r\nThe little flames began to peer up between the big logs atop of the\r\nbrushwood. ‘The Government should teach us to pull the triggers with\r\nour toes,’ said Suket Singh grimly to the moon. That was the last public\r\nobservation of Sepoy Suket Singh.\r\n\r\n Upon a day, early in the morning, Madu came to the pyre and shrieked\r\nvery grievously, and ran away to catch the Policeman who was on tour in\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\n‘The base-born has ruined four rupees’ worth of charcoal wood,’ Madu\r\ngasped. ‘He has also killed my wife, and he has left a letter which I\r\ncannot read, tied to a pine bough.’\r\n\r\nIn the stiff, formal hand taught in the regimental school, Sepoy Suket\r\nSingh had written--\r\n\r\n‘Let us be burned together, if anything remain over, for we have made\r\nthe necessary prayers. We have also cursed Madu, and Malak the brother\r\nof Athira--both evil men. Send my service to the Colonel Sahib Bahadur.’\r\n\r\nThe Policeman looked long and curiously at the marriage bed of red and\r\nwhite ashes on which lay, dull black, the barrel of the Ranger’s gun.\r\nHe drove his spurred heel absently into a half-charred log, and the\r\nchattering sparks flew upwards. ‘Most extraordinary people,’ said the\r\nPoliceman.\r\n\r\n‘WHE-W, WHEW, OUIOU,’ said the little flames.\r\n\r\nThe Policeman entered the dry bones of the case, for the Punjab\r\nGovernment does not approve of romancing, in his Diary.\r\n\r\n‘But who will pay me those four rupees?’ said Madu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCES OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening meal was ended in Dhunni Bhagat’s Chubara and the old\r\npriests were smoking or counting their beads. A little naked child\r\npattered in, with its mouth wide open, a handful of marigold flowers\r\nin one hand, and a lump of conserved tobacco in the other. It tried\r\nto kneel and make obeisance to Gobind, but it was so fat that it fell\r\nforward on its shaven head, and rolled on its side, kicking and gasping,\r\nwhile the marigolds tumbled one way and the tobacco the other. Gobind\r\nlaughed, set it up again, and blessed the marigold flowers as he\r\nreceived the tobacco.\r\n\r\n‘From my father,’ said the child. ‘He has the fever, and cannot come.\r\nWilt thou pray for him, father?’\r\n\r\n‘Surely, littlest; but the smoke is on the ground, and the night-chill\r\nis in the airs, and it is not good to go abroad naked in the autumn.’\r\n\r\n‘I have no clothes,’ said the child, ‘and all to-day I have been\r\ncarrying cow-dung cakes to the bazar. It was very hot, and I am very\r\ntired.’ It shivered a little, for the twilight was cool.\r\n\r\nGobind lifted an arm under his vast tattered quilt of many colours, and\r\nmade an inviting little nest by his side. The child crept in, and Gobind\r\nfilled his brass-studded leather waterpipe with the new tobacco. When\r\nI came to the Chubara the shaven head with the tuft atop, and the beady\r\nblack eyes looked out of the folds of the quilt as a squirrel looks out\r\nfrom his nest, and Gobind was smiling while the child played with his\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nI would have said something friendly, but remembered in time that if the\r\nchild fell ill afterwards I should be credited with the Evil Eye, and\r\nthat is a horrible possession.\r\n\r\n‘Sit thou still, Thumbling,’ I said as it made to get up and run away.\r\n‘Where is thy slate, and why has the teacher let such an evil character\r\nloose on the streets when there are no police to protect us weaklings?\r\nIn which ward dost thou try to break thy neck with flying kites from the\r\nhouse-tops?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, Sahib, nay,’ said the child, burrowing its face into Gobind’s\r\nbeard, and twisting uneasily. ‘There was a holiday to-day among the\r\nschools, and I do not always fly kites. I play ker-li-kit like the\r\nrest.’\r\n\r\nCricket is the national game among the schoolboys of the Punjab, from\r\nthe naked hedge-school children, who use an old kerosene-tin for wicket,\r\nto the B.A.’s of the University, who compete for the Championship belt.\r\n\r\n‘Thou play kerlikit! Thou art half the height of the bat!’ I said.\r\n\r\nThe child nodded resolutely. ‘Yea, I DO play. PERLAYBALL OW-AT! RAN,\r\nRAN, RAN! I know it all.’\r\n\r\n‘But thou must not forget with all this to pray to the Gods according\r\nto custom,’ said Gobind, who did not altogether approve of cricket and\r\nwestern innovations.\r\n\r\n‘I do not forget,’ said the child in a hushed voice.\r\n\r\n‘Also to give reverence to thy teacher, and’--Gobind’s voice softened--’\r\nto abstain from pulling holy men by the beard, little badling. Eh, eh,\r\neh?’\r\n\r\nThe child’s face was altogether hidden in the great white beard, and it\r\nbegan to whimper till Gobind soothed it as children are soothed all the\r\nworld over, with the promise of a story.\r\n\r\n‘I did not think to frighten thee, senseless little one. Look up! Am I\r\nangry? Are, are, are! Shall I weep too, and of our tears make a great\r\npond and drown us both, and then thy father will never get well, lacking\r\nthee to pull his beard? Peace, peace, and I will tell thee of the Gods.\r\nThou hast heard many tales?’\r\n\r\n‘Very many, father.’\r\n\r\n‘Now, this is a new one which thou hast not heard. Long and long ago\r\nwhen the Gods walked with men as they do to-day, but that we have not\r\nfaith to see, Shiv, the greatest of Gods, and Parbati his wife, were\r\nwalking in the garden of a temple.’\r\n\r\n‘Which temple? That in the Nandgaon ward?’ said the child.\r\n\r\n‘Nay, very far away. Maybe at Trimbak or Hurdwar, whither thou must make\r\npilgrimage when thou art a man. Now, there was sitting in the garden\r\nunder the jujube trees, a mendicant that had worshipped Shiv for\r\nforty years, and he lived on the offerings of the pious, and meditated\r\nholiness night and day.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh father, was it thou?’ said the child, looking up with large eyes.\r\n\r\n‘Nay, I have said it was long ago, and, moreover, this mendicant was\r\nmarried.’\r\n\r\n‘Did they put him on a horse with flowers on his head, and forbid him\r\nto go to sleep all night long? Thus they did to me when they made my\r\nwedding,’ said the child, who had been married a few months before.\r\n\r\n‘And what didst thou do?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘I wept, and they called me evil names, and then I smote HER, and we\r\nwept together.’\r\n\r\n‘Thus did not the mendicant,’ said Gobind; ‘for he was a holy man, and\r\nvery poor. Parbati perceived him sitting naked by the temple steps where\r\nall went up and down, and she said to Shiv, “What shall men think of the\r\nGods when the Gods thus scorn their worshippers? For forty years yonder\r\nman has prayed to us, and yet there be only a few grains of rice and\r\nsome broken cowries before him after all. Men’s hearts will be hardened\r\nby this thing.” And Shiv said, “It shall be looked to,” and so he called\r\nto the temple which was the temple of his son, Ganesh of the elephant\r\nhead, saying, “Son, there is a mendicant without who is very poor. What\r\nwilt thou do for him?” Then that great elephant-headed One awoke in the\r\ndark and answered, “In three days, if it be thy will, he shall have one\r\nlakh of rupees.” Then Shiv and Parbati went away.\r\n\r\n‘But there was a money-lender in the garden hidden among the\r\nmarigolds’--the child looked at the ball of crumpled blossoms in its\r\nhands--‘ay, among the yellow marigolds, and he heard the Gods talking.\r\nHe was a covetous man, and of a black heart, and he desired that lakh\r\nof rupees for himself. So he went to the mendicant and said, “O brother,\r\nhow much do the pious give thee daily?” The mendicant said, “I cannot\r\ntell. Sometimes a little rice, sometimes a little pulse, and a few\r\ncowries and, it has been, pickled mangoes, and dried fish.”’\r\n\r\n‘That is good,’ said the child, smacking its lips.\r\n\r\n‘Then said the money-lender, “Because I have long watched thee, and\r\nlearned to love thee and thy patience, I will give thee now five rupees\r\nfor all thy earnings of the three days to come. There is only a bond\r\nto sign on the matter.” But the mendicant said, “Thou art mad. In two\r\nmonths I do not receive the worth of five rupees,” and he told the\r\nthing to his wife that evening. She, being a woman, said, “When did\r\nmoney-lender ever make a bad bargain? The wolf runs through the corn for\r\nthe sake of the fat deer. Our fate is in the hands of the Gods. Pledge\r\nit not even for three days.”\r\n\r\n‘So the mendicant returned to the money-lender, and would not sell. Then\r\nthat wicked man sat all day before him offering more and more for those\r\nthree days’ earnings. First, ten, fifty, and a hundred rupees; and then,\r\nfor he did not know when the Gods would pour down their gifts, rupees by\r\nthe thousand, till he had offered half a lakh of rupees. Upon this sum\r\nthe mendicant’s wife shifted her counsel, and the mendicant signed the\r\nbond, and the money was paid in silver; great white bullocks bringing it\r\nby the cartload. But saving only all that money, the mendicant received\r\nnothing from the Gods at all, and the heart of the money-lender was\r\nuneasy on account of expectation. Therefore at noon of the third day the\r\nmoney-lender went into the temple to spy upon the councils of the Gods,\r\nand to learn in what manner that gift might arrive. Even as he was\r\nmaking his prayers, a crack between the stones of the floor gaped, and,\r\nclosing, caught him by the heel. Then he heard the Gods walking in\r\nthe temple in the darkness of the columns, and Shiv called to his son\r\nGanesh, saying, “Son, what hast thou done in regard to the lakh of\r\nrupees for the mendicant?” And Ganesh woke, for the money-lender heard\r\nthe dry rustle of his trunk uncoiling, and he answered, “Father, one\r\nhalf of the money has been paid, and the debtor for the other half I\r\nhold here fast by the heel.”’\r\n\r\nThe child bubbled with laughter. ‘And the moneylender paid the\r\nmendicant?’ it said.\r\n\r\n‘Surely, for he whom the Gods hold by the heel must pay to the\r\nuttermost. The money was paid at evening, all silver, in great carts,\r\nand thus Ganesh did his work.’\r\n\r\n‘Nathu! Ohe Nathu!’\r\n\r\nA woman was calling in the dusk by the door of the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe child began to wriggle. ‘That is my mother,’ it said.\r\n\r\n‘Go then, littlest,’ answered Gobind; ‘but stay a moment.’\r\n\r\nHe ripped a generous yard from his patchwork-quilt, put it over the\r\nchild’s shoulders, and the child ran away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMIR’S HOMILY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MacMillan & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness Abdur Rahman, Amir of Afghanistan, G.C.S.I., and\r\ntrusted ally of Her Imperial Majesty the Queen of England and Empress of\r\nIndia, is a gentleman for whom all right-thinking people should have a\r\nprofound regard. Like most other rulers, he governs not as he would but\r\nas he can, and the mantle of his authority covers the most turbulent\r\nrace under the stars. To the Afghan neither life, property, law, nor\r\nkingship are sacred when his own lusts prompt him to rebel. He is a\r\nthief by instinct, a murderer by heredity and training, and frankly and\r\nbestially immoral by all three. None the less he has his own crooked\r\nnotions of honour, and his character is fascinating to study. On\r\noccasion he will fight without reason given till he is hacked in pieces;\r\non other occasions he will refuse to show fight till he is driven into\r\na corner. Herein he is as unaccountable as the gray wolf, who is his\r\nblood-brother.\r\n\r\nAnd these men His Highness rules by the only weapon that they\r\nunderstand--the fear of death, which among some Orientals is the\r\nbeginning of wisdom. Some say that the Amir’s authority reaches no\r\nfarther than a rifle bullet can range; but as none are quite certain\r\nwhen their king may be in their midst, and as he alone holds every one\r\nof the threads of Government, his respect is increased among men. Gholam\r\nHyder, the Commander-in-chief of the Afghan army, is feared reasonably,\r\nfor he can impale; all Kabul city fears the Governor of Kabul, who\r\nhas power of life and death through all the wards; but the Amir of\r\nAfghanistan, though outlying tribes pretend otherwise when his back is\r\nturned, is dreaded beyond chief and governor together. His word is red\r\nlaw; by the gust of his passion falls the leaf of man’s life, and his\r\nfavour is terrible. He has suffered many things, and been a hunted\r\nfugitive before he came to the throne, and he understands all the\r\nclasses of his people. By the custom of the East any man or woman having\r\na complaint to make, or an enemy against whom to be avenged, has\r\nthe right of speaking face to face with the king at the daily public\r\naudience. This is personal government, as it was in the days of Harun al\r\nRaschid of blessed memory, whose times exist still and will exist long\r\nafter the English have passed away.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of open speech is of course exercised at certain personal\r\nrisk. The king may be pleased, and raise the speaker to honour for\r\nthat very bluntness of speech which three minutes later brings a too\r\nimitative petitioner to the edge of the ever ready blade. And the people\r\nlove to have it so, for it is their right.\r\n\r\nIt happened upon a day in Kabul that the Amir chose to do his day’s work\r\nin the Baber Gardens, which lie a short distance from the city of Kabul.\r\nA light table stood before him, and round the table in the open air were\r\ngrouped generals and finance ministers according to their degree. The\r\nCourt and the long tail of feudal chiefs--men of blood, fed and cowed\r\nby blood--stood in an irregular semicircle round the table, and the wind\r\nfrom the Kabul orchards blew among them. All day long sweating couriers\r\ndashed in with letters from the outlying districts with rumours of\r\nrebellion, intrigue, famine, failure of payments, or announcements of\r\ntreasure on the road; and all day long the Amir would read the dockets,\r\nand pass such of these as were less private to the officials whom\r\nthey directly concerned, or call up a waiting chief for a word of\r\nexplanation. It is well to speak clearly to the ruler of Afghanistan.\r\nThen the grim head, under the black astrachan cap with the diamond star\r\nin front, would nod gravely, and that chief would return to his fellows.\r\nOnce that afternoon a woman clamoured for divorce against her husband,\r\nwho was bald, and the Amir, hearing both sides of the case, bade her\r\npour curds over the bare scalp, and lick them off, that the hair might\r\ngrown again, and she be contented. Here the Court laughed, and the woman\r\nwithdrew, cursing her king under her breath.\r\n\r\nBut when twilight was falling, and the order of the Court was a little\r\nrelaxed, there came before the king, in custody, a trembling haggard\r\nwretch, sore with much buffeting, but of stout enough build, who had\r\nstolen three rupees--of such small matters does His Highness take\r\ncognisance.\r\n\r\n‘Why did you steal?’ said he; and when the king asks questions they do\r\nthemselves service who answer directly.\r\n\r\n‘I was poor, and no one gave. Hungry, and there was no food.’\r\n\r\n‘Why did you not work?’\r\n\r\n‘I could find no work, Protector of the Poor, and I was starving.’\r\n\r\n‘You lie. You stole for drink, for lust, for idleness, for anything but\r\nhunger, since any man who will may find work and daily bread.’\r\n\r\nThe prisoner dropped his eyes. He had attended the Court before, and he\r\nknew the ring of the death-tone.\r\n\r\n‘Any man may get work. Who knows this so well as I do? for I too have\r\nbeen hungered--not like you, bastard scum, but as any honest man may be,\r\nby the turn of Fate and the will of God.’\r\n\r\nGrowing warm, the Amir turned to his nobles all arow and thrust the hilt\r\nof his sabre aside with his elbow.\r\n\r\n‘You have heard this Son of Lies? Hear me tell a true tale. I also was\r\nonce starved, and tightened my belt on the sharp belly-pinch. Nor was\r\nI alone, for with me was another, who did not fail me in my evil days,\r\nwhen I was hunted, before ever I came to this throne. And wandering like\r\na houseless dog by Kandahar, my money melted, melted, melted till--’ He\r\nflung out a bare palm before the audience. ‘And day upon day, faint and\r\nsick, I went back to that one who waited, and God knows how we lived,\r\ntill on a day I took our best lihaf--silk it was, fine work of Iran,\r\nsuch as no needle now works, warm, and a coverlet for two, and all that\r\nwe had. I brought it to a money-lender in a bylane, and I asked for\r\nthree rupees upon it. He said to me, who am now the King, “You are a\r\nthief. This is worth three hundred.” “I am no thief,” I answered, “but a\r\nprince of good blood, and I am hungry.”--“Prince of wandering beggars,”\r\n said that money-lender, “I have no money with me, but go to my house\r\nwith my clerk and he will give you two rupees eight annas, for that is\r\nall I will lend.” So I went with the clerk to the house, and we talked\r\non the way, and he gave me the money. We lived on it till it was spent,\r\nand we fared hard. And then that clerk said, being a young man of a good\r\nheart, “Surely the money-lender will lend yet more on that lihaf,” and\r\nhe offered me two rupees. These I refused, saying, “Nay; but get me\r\nsome work.” And he got me work, and I, even I, Abdur Rahman, Amir\r\nof Afghanistan, wrought day by day as a coolie, bearing burdens, and\r\nlabouring of my hands, receiving four annas wage a day for my sweat and\r\nbackache. But he, this bastard son of naught, must steal! For a year\r\nand four months I worked, and none dare say that I lie, for I have a\r\nwitness, even that clerk who is now my friend.’\r\n\r\nThen there rose in his place among the Sirdars and the nobles one clad\r\nin silk, who folded his hands and said, ‘This is the truth of God, for\r\nI, who, by the favour of God and the Amir, am such as you know, was once\r\nclerk to that money-lender.’\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and the Amir cried hoarsely to the prisoner, throwing\r\nscorn upon him, till he ended with the dread ‘Dar arid,’ which clinches\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nSo they led the thief away, and the whole of him was seen no more\r\ntogether; and the Court rustled out of its silence, whispering, ‘Before\r\nGod and the Prophet, but this is a man!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWS IN SHUSHAN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1981, by Macmillan & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy newly purchased house furniture was, at the least, insecure; the legs\r\nparted from the chairs, and the tops from the tables, on the slightest\r\nprovocation. But such as it was, it was to be paid for, and Ephraim,\r\nagent and collector for the local auctioneer, waited in the verandah\r\nwith the receipt. He was announced by the Mahomedan servant as ‘Ephraim,\r\nYahudi’--Ephraim the Jew. He who believes in the Brotherhood of Man\r\nshould hear my Elahi Bukhsh grinding the second word through his white\r\nteeth with all the scorn he dare show before his master. Ephraim was,\r\npersonally, meek in manner--so meek indeed that one could not understand\r\nhow he had fallen into the profession of bill-collecting. He resembled\r\nan over-fed sheep, and his voice suited his figure. There was a fixed,\r\nunvarying mask of childish wonder upon his face. If you paid him, he\r\nwas as one marvelling at your wealth; if you sent him away, he seemed\r\npuzzled at your hard-heartedness. Never was Jew more unlike his\r\ndread breed. Ephraim wore list slippers and coats of duster-cloth, so\r\npreposterously patterned that the most brazen of British subalterns\r\nwould have shied from them in fear. Very slow and deliberate was his\r\nspeech, and carefully guarded to give offence to no one. After many\r\nweeks, Ephraim was induced to speak to me of his friends.\r\n\r\n‘There be eight of us in Shushan, and we are waiting till there are ten.\r\nThen we shall apply for a synagogue, and get leave from Calcutta.\r\nTo-day we have no synagogue; and I, only I, am Priest and Butcher to\r\nour people. I am of the tribe of Judah--I think, but I am not sure. My\r\nfather was of the tribe of Judah, and we wish much to get our synagogue.\r\nI shall be a priest of that synagogue.’\r\n\r\nShushan is a big city in the North of India, counting its dwellers by\r\nthe ten thousand; and these eight of the Chosen People were shut up\r\nin its midst, waiting till time or chance sent them their full\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nMiriam the wife of Ephraim, two little children, an orphan boy of their\r\npeople, Epraim’s uncle Jackrael Israel, a white-haired old man, his wife\r\nHester, a Jew from Cutch, one Hyem Benjamin, and Ephraim, Priest and\r\nButcher, made up the list of the Jews in Shushan. They lived in one\r\nhouse, on the outskirts of the great city, amid heaps of saltpetre,\r\nrotten bricks, herds of kine, and a fixed pillar of dust caused by the\r\nincessant passing of the beasts to the river to drink. In the evening\r\nthe children of the City came to the waste place to fly their kites, and\r\nEphraim’s sons held aloof, watching the sport from the roof, but never\r\ndescending to take part in them. At the back of the house stood a small\r\nbrick enclosure, in which Ephraim prepared the daily meat for his people\r\nafter the custom of the Jews. Once the rude door of the square was\r\nsuddenly smashed open by a struggle from inside, and showed the meek\r\nbill-collector at his work, nostrils dilated, lips drawn back over\r\nhis teeth, and his hands upon a half-maddened sheep. He was attired in\r\nstrange raiment, having no relation whatever to duster coats or list\r\nslippers, and a knife was in his mouth. As he struggled with the animal\r\nbetween the walls, the breath came from him in thick sobs, and the\r\nnature of the man seemed changed. When the ordained slaughter was ended,\r\nhe saw that the door was open and shut it hastily, his hand leaving\r\na red mark on the timber, while his children from the neighbouring\r\nhouse-top looked down awe-stricken and open-eyed. A glimpse of Ephraim\r\nbusied in one of his religious capacities was no thing to be desired\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nSummer came upon Shushan, turning the trodden waste-ground to iron, and\r\nbringing sickness to the city.\r\n\r\n‘It will not touch us,’ said Ephraim confidently. ‘Before the winter\r\nwe shall have our synagogue. My brother and his wife and children\r\nare coming up from Calcutta, and THEN I shall be the priest of the\r\nsynagogue.’\r\n\r\nJackrael Israel, the old man, would crawl out in the stifling evenings\r\nto sit on the rubbish-heap and watch the corpses being borne down to the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n‘It will not come near us,’ said Jackrael Israel feebly, ‘for we are the\r\nPeople of God, and my nephew will be priest of our synagogue. Let them\r\ndie.’ He crept back to his house again and barred the door to shut\r\nhimself off from the world of the Gentile.\r\n\r\nBut Miriam, the wife of Ephraim, looked out of the window at the dead\r\nas the biers passed and said that she was afraid. Ephraim comforted\r\nher with hopes of the synagogue to be, and collected bills as was his\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nIn one night, the two children died and were buried early in the morning\r\nby Ephraim. The deaths never appeared in the City returns. ‘The sorrow\r\nis my sorrow,’ said Ephraim; and this to him seemed a sufficient reason\r\nfor setting at naught the sanitary regulations of a large, flourishing,\r\nand remarkably well-governed Empire.\r\n\r\nThe orphan boy, dependent on the charity of Ephraim and his wife, could\r\nhave felt no gratitude, and must have been a ruffian. He begged for\r\nwhatever money his protectors would give him, and with that fled\r\ndown-country for his life. A week after the death of her children Miriam\r\nleft her bed at night and wandered over the country to find them. She\r\nheard them crying behind every bush, or drowning in every pool of water\r\nin the fields, and she begged the cartmen on the Grand Trunk Road not\r\nto steal her little ones from her. In the morning the sun rose and beat\r\nupon her bare head, and she turned into the cool wet crops to lie down\r\nand never came back; though Hyem Benjamin and Ephraim sought her for two\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nThe look of patient wonder on Ephraim’s face deepened, but he presently\r\nfound an explanation. ‘There are so few of us here, and these people are\r\nso many,’ said he, ‘that, it may be, our God has forgotten us.’\r\n\r\nIn the house on the outskirts of the city old Jackrael Israel and Hester\r\ngrumbled that there was no one to wait on them, and that Miriam had been\r\nuntrue to her race. Ephraim went out and collected bills, and in the\r\nevenings smoked with Hyem Benjamin till, one dawning, Hyem Benjamin\r\ndied, having first paid all his debts to Ephraim. Jackrael Israel and\r\nHester sat alone in the empty house all day, and, when Ephraim returned,\r\nwept the easy tears of age till they cried themselves asleep.\r\n\r\nA week later Ephraim, staggering under a huge bundle of clothes and\r\ncooking-pots, led the old man and woman to the railway station, where\r\nthe bustle and confusion made them whimper.\r\n\r\n‘We are going back to Calcutta,’ said Ephraim, to whose sleeve Hester\r\nwas clinging. ‘There are more of us there, and here my house is empty.’\r\n\r\nHe helped Hester into the carriage and, turning back, said to me, ‘I\r\nshould have been priest of the synagogue if there had been ten of us.\r\nSurely we must have been forgotten by our God.’\r\n\r\nThe remnant of the broken colony passed out of the station on their\r\njourney south; while a subaltern, turning over the books on the\r\nbookstall, was whistling to himself ‘The Ten Little Nigger Boys.’\r\n\r\nBut the tune sounded as solemn as the Dead March.\r\n\r\nIt was the dirge of the Jews in Shushan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITATIONS OF PAMBE SERANG\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN\r\n& Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you consider the circumstances of the case, it was the only thing\r\nthat he could do. But Pambe Serang has been hanged by the neck till he\r\nis dead, and Nurkeed is dead also.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, when the Elsass-Lothringen steamer Saarbruck was\r\ncoaling at Aden and the weather was very hot indeed, Nurkeed, the big\r\nfat Zanzibar stoker who fed the second right furnace thirty feet down\r\nin the hold, got leave to go ashore. He departed a ‘Seedee boy,’ as they\r\ncall the stokers; he returned the full-blooded Sultan of Zanzibar--His\r\nHighness Sayyid Burgash, with a bottle in each hand. Then he sat on the\r\nfore-hatch grating, eating salt fish and onions, and singing the songs\r\nof a far country. The food belonged to Pambe, the Serang or head man of\r\nthe lascar sailors. He had just cooked it for himself, turned to borrow\r\nsome salt, and when he came back Nurkeed’s dirty black fingers were\r\nspading into the rice.\r\n\r\nA serang is a person of importance, far above a stoker, though the\r\nstoker draws better pay. He sets the chorus of ‘Hya! Hulla! Hee-ah!\r\nHeh!’ when the captain’s gig is pulled up to the davits; he heaves\r\nthe lead too; and sometimes, when all the ship is lazy, he puts on\r\nhis whitest muslin and a big red sash, and plays with the passengers’\r\nchildren on the quarter-deck. Then the passengers give him money, and he\r\nsaves it all up for an orgie at Bombay or Calcutta, or Pulu Penang. ‘Ho!\r\nyou fat black barrel, you’re eating my food!’ said Pambe, in the Other\r\nLingua Franca that begins where the Levant tongue stops, and runs from\r\nPort Said eastward till east is west, and the sealing-brigs of the\r\nKurile Islands gossip with the strayed Hakodate junks.\r\n\r\n‘Son of Eblis, monkey-face, dried shark’s liver, pigman, I am the Sultan\r\nSayyid Burgash, and the commander of all this ship. Take away your\r\ngarbage;’ and Nurkeed thrust the empty pewter rice-plate into Pambe’s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nPambe beat it into a basin over Nurkeed’s woolly head. Nurkeed drew HIS\r\nsheath-knife and stabbed Pambe in the leg. Pambe drew his sheath-knife;\r\nbut Nurkeed dropped down into the darkness of the hold and spat through\r\nthe grating at Pambe, who was staining the clean fore-deck with his\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nOnly the white moon saw these things; for the officers were looking\r\nafter the coaling, and the passengers were tossing in their close\r\ncabins. ‘All right,’ said Pambe--and went forward to tie up his leg--‘we\r\nwill settle the account later on.’\r\n\r\nHe was a Malay born in India: married once in Burma, where his wife had\r\na cigar-shop on the Shwe Dagon road; once in Singapore, to a Chinese\r\ngirl; and once in Madras, to a Mahomedan woman who sold fowls. The\r\nEnglish sailor cannot, owing to postal and telegraph facilities,\r\nmarry as profusely as he used to do; but native sailors can, being\r\nuninfluenced by the barbarous inventions of the Western savage. Pambe\r\nwas a good husband when he happened to remember the existence of a wife;\r\nbut he was also a very good Malay; and it is not wise to offend a Malay,\r\nbecause he does not forget anything. Moreover, in Pambe’s case blood had\r\nbeen drawn and food spoiled.\r\n\r\nNext morning Nurkeed rose with a blank mind. He was no longer Sultan\r\nof Zanzibar, but a very hot stoker. So he went on deck and opened\r\nhis jacket to the morning breeze, till a sheath-knife came like a\r\nflying-fish and stuck into the woodwork of the cook’s galley half an\r\ninch from his right armpit. He ran down below before his time, trying\r\nto remember what he could have said to the owner of the weapon. At noon,\r\nwhen all the ship’s lascars were feeding, Nurkeed advanced into their\r\nmidst, and, being a placid man with a large regard for his own skin, he\r\nopened negotiations, saying, ‘Men of the ship, last night I was drunk,\r\nand this morning I know that I behaved unseemly to some one or another\r\nof you. Who was that man, that I may meet him face to face and say that\r\nI was drunk?’\r\n\r\nPambe measured the distance to Nurkeed’s naked breast. If he sprang at\r\nhim he might be tripped up, and a blind blow at the chest sometimes only\r\nmeans a gash on the breast-bone. Ribs are difficult to thrust between\r\nunless the subject be asleep. So he said nothing; nor did the other\r\nlascars. Their faces immediately dropped all expression, as is the\r\ncustom of the Oriental when there is killing on the carpet or any chance\r\nof trouble. Nurkeed looked long at the white eyeballs. He was only\r\nan African, and could not read characters. A big sigh--almost a\r\ngroan--broke from him, and he went back to the furnaces. The lascars\r\ntook up the conversation where he had interrupted it. They talked of the\r\nbest methods of cooking rice.\r\n\r\nNurkeed suffered considerably from lack of fresh air during the run to\r\nBombay. He only came on deck to breathe when all the world was about;\r\nand even then a heavy block once dropped from a derrick within a foot\r\nof his head, and an apparently firm-lashed grating on which he set his\r\nfoot, began to turn over with the intention of dropping him on the cased\r\ncargo fifteen feet below; and one insupportable night the sheath-knife\r\ndropped from the fo’c’s’le, and this time it drew blood. So Nurkeed\r\nmade complaint; and, when the Saarbruck reached Bombay, fled and buried\r\nhimself among eight hundred thousand people, and did not sign articles\r\ntill the ship had been a month gone from the port. Pambe waited too;\r\nbut his Bombay wife grew clamorous, and he was forced to sign in the\r\nSpicheren to Hongkong, because he realised that all play and no work\r\ngives Jack a ragged shirt. In the foggy China seas he thought a great\r\ndeal of Nurkeed, and, when Elsass-Lothringen steamers lay in port with\r\nthe Spicheren, inquired after him and found he had gone to England via\r\nthe Cape, on the Gravelotte. Pambe came to England on the Worth. The\r\nSpicheren met her by the Nore Light. Nurkeed was going out with the\r\nSpicheren to the Calicut coast.\r\n\r\n‘Want to find a friend, my trap-mouthed coal-scuttle?’ said a gentleman\r\nin the mercantile service. ‘Nothing easier. Wait at the Nyanza Docks\r\ntill he comes. Every one comes to the Nyanza Docks. Wait, you poor\r\nheathen.’ The gentleman spoke truth. There are three great doors in the\r\nworld where, if you stand long enough, you shall meet any one you wish.\r\nThe head of the Suez Canal is one, but there Death comes also; Charing\r\nCross Station is the second--for inland work; and the Nyanza Docks is\r\nthe third. At each of these places are men and women looking eternally\r\nfor those who will surely come. So Pambe waited at the docks. Time was\r\nno object to him; and the wives could wait, as he did from day to day,\r\nweek to week, and month to month, by the Blue Diamond funnels, the Red\r\nDot smoke-stacks, the Yellow Streaks, and the nameless dingy gypsies of\r\nthe sea that loaded and unloaded, jostled, whistled, and roared in\r\nthe everlasting fog. When money failed, a kind gentleman told Pambe to\r\nbecome a Christian; and Pambe became one with great speed, getting his\r\nreligious teachings between ship and ship’s arrival, and six or seven\r\nshillings a week for distributing tracts to mariners. What the faith\r\nwas Pambe did not in the least care; but he knew if he said ‘Native\r\nKi-lis-ti-an, Sar’ to men with long black coats he might get a few\r\ncoppers; and the tracts were vendible at a little public-house that\r\nsold shag by the ‘dottel,’ which is even smaller weight than the\r\n‘half-screw,’ which is less than the half-ounce, and a most profitable\r\nretail trade.\r\n\r\nBut after eight months Pambe fell sick with pneumonia, contracted from\r\nlong standing still in slush; and much against his will he was forced to\r\nlie down in his two-and-sixpenny room raging against Fate.\r\n\r\nThe kind gentleman sat by his bedside, and grieved to find that Pambe\r\ntalked in strange tongues, instead of listening to good books, and\r\nalmost seemed to become a benighted heathen again--till one day he was\r\nroused from semi-stupor by a voice in the street by the dock-head. ‘My\r\nfriend--he,’ whispered Pambe. ‘Call now--call Nurkeed. Quick! God has\r\nsent him!’\r\n\r\n‘He wanted one of his own race,’ said the kind gentleman; and, going\r\nout, he called ‘Nurkeed!’ at the top of his voice. An excessively\r\ncoloured man in a rasping white shirt and brand-new slops, a shining\r\nhat, and a breastpin, turned round. Many voyages had taught Nurkeed how\r\nto spend his money and made him a citizen of the world.\r\n\r\n‘Hi! Yes!’ said he, when the situation was explained. ‘Command\r\nhim--black nigger--when I was in the Saarbruck. Ole Pambe, good ole\r\nPambe. Dam lascar. Show him up, Sar;’ and he followed into the room. One\r\nglance told the stoker what the kind gentleman had overlooked. Pambe was\r\ndesperately poor. Nurkeed drove his hands deep into his pockets, then\r\nadvanced with clenched fists on the sick, shouting, ‘Hya, Pambe. Hya!\r\nHee-ah! Hulla! Heh! Takilo! Takilo! Make fast aft, Pambe. You know,\r\nPambe. You know me. Dekho, jee! Look! Dam big fat lazy lascar!’\r\n\r\nPambe beckoned with his left hand. His right was under his pillow.\r\nNurkeed removed his gorgeous hat and stooped over Pambe till he could\r\ncatch a faint whisper. ‘How beautiful!’ said the kind gentleman. ‘How\r\nthese Orientals love like children!’\r\n\r\n‘Spit him out,’ said Nurkeed, leaning over Pambe yet more closely.\r\n\r\n‘Touching the matter of that fish and onions--’ said Pambe--and sent the\r\nknife home under the edge of the rib-bone upwards and forwards.\r\n\r\nThere was a thick sick cough, and the body of the African slid slowly\r\nfrom the bed, his clutching hands letting fall a shower of silver pieces\r\nthat ran across the room.\r\n\r\n‘Now I can die!’ said Pambe.\r\n\r\nBut he did not die. He was nursed back to life with all the skill\r\nthat money could buy, for the Law wanted him; and in the end he grew\r\nsufficiently healthy to be hanged in due and proper form.\r\n\r\nPambe did not care particularly; but it was a sad blow to the kind\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE TOBRAH\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Prisoner’s head did not reach to the top of the dock,’ as the English\r\nnewspapers say. This case, however, was not reported because nobody\r\ncared by so much as a hempen rope for the life or death of Little\r\nTobrah. The assessors in the red court-house sat upon him all through\r\nthe long hot afternoon, and whenever they asked him a question\r\nhe salaamed and whined. Their verdict was that the evidence was\r\ninconclusive, and the Judge concurred. It was true that the dead body\r\nof Little Tobrah’s sister had been found at the bottom of the well, and\r\nLittle Tobrah was the only human being within a half mile radius at the\r\ntime; but the child might have fallen in by accident. Therefore Little\r\nTobrah was acquitted, and told to go where he pleased. This permission\r\nwas not so generous as it sounds, for he had nowhere to go to, nothing\r\nin particular to eat, and nothing whatever to wear.\r\n\r\nHe trotted into the court-compound, and sat upon the well-kerb,\r\nwondering whether an unsuccessful dive into the black water below would\r\nend in a forced voyage across the other Black Water. A groom put down\r\nan emptied nose-bag on the bricks, and Little Tobrah, being hungry, set\r\nhimself to scrape out what wet grain the horse had overlooked.\r\n\r\n‘O Thief--and but newly set free from the terror of the Law! Come\r\nalong!’ said the groom, and Little Tobrah was led by the ear to a large\r\nand fat Englishman, who heard the tale of the theft.\r\n\r\n‘Hah!’ said the Englishman three times (only he said a stronger word).\r\n‘Put him into the net and take him home.’ So Little Tobrah was thrown\r\ninto the net of the cart, and, nothing doubting that he should be\r\nstuck like a pig, was driven to the Englishman’s house. ‘Hah!’ said the\r\nEnglishman as before. ‘Wet grain, by Jove! Feed the little beggar, some\r\nof you, and we’ll make a riding-boy of him! See? Wet grain, good Lord!’\r\n\r\n‘Give an account of yourself,’ said the Head of the Grooms, to Little\r\nTobrah after the meal had been eaten, and the servants lay at ease in\r\ntheir quarters behind the house. ‘You are not of the groom caste, unless\r\nit be for the stomach’s sake. How came you into the court, and why?\r\nAnswer, little devil’s spawn!’\r\n\r\n‘There was not enough to eat,’ said Little Tobrah calmly. ‘This is a\r\ngood place.’\r\n\r\n‘Talk straight talk,’ said the Head Groom, ‘or I will make you clean out\r\nthe stable of that large red stallion who bites like a camel.’\r\n\r\n‘We be Telis, oil-pressers,’ said Little Tobrah, scratching his toes in\r\nthe dust. ‘We were Telis--my father, my mother, my brother, the elder by\r\nfour years, myself, and the sister.’\r\n\r\n‘She who was found dead in the well?’ said one who had heard something\r\nof the trial.\r\n\r\n‘Even so,’ said Little Tobrah gravely. ‘She who was found dead in the\r\nwell. It befel upon a time, which is not in my memory, that the sickness\r\ncame to the village where our oil-press stood, and first my sister was\r\nsmitten as to her eyes, and went without sight, for it was mata--the\r\nsmallpox. Thereafter, my father and my mother died of that same\r\nsickness, so we were alone--my brother who had twelve years, I who had\r\neight, and the sister who could not see. Yet were there the bullock and\r\nthe oil-press remaining, and we made shift to press the oil as before.\r\nBut Surjun Dass, the grain-seller, cheated us in his dealings; and it\r\nwas always a stubborn bullock to drive. We put marigold flowers for the\r\nGods upon the neck of the bullock, and upon the great grinding-beam that\r\nrose through the roof; but we gained nothing thereby, and Surjun Dass\r\nwas a hard man.’\r\n\r\n‘Bapri-bap,’ muttered the grooms’ wives, ‘to cheat a child so! But WE\r\nknow what the bunnia-folk are, sisters.’\r\n\r\n‘The press was an old press, and we were not strong men--my brother and\r\nI; nor could we fix the neck of the beam firmly in the shackle.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, indeed,’ said the gorgeously-clad wife of the Head Groom, joining\r\nthe circle. ‘That is a strong man’s work. When I was a maid in my\r\nfather’s house----’\r\n\r\n‘Peace, woman,’ said the Head Groom. ‘Go on, boy.’\r\n\r\n‘It is nothing,’ said Little Tobrah. ‘The big beam tore down the roof\r\nupon a day which is not in my memory, and with the roof fell much of the\r\nhinder wall, and both together upon our bullock, whose back was broken.\r\nThus we had neither home, nor press, nor bullock--my brother, myself,\r\nand the sister who was blind. We went crying away from that place,\r\nhand-in-hand, across the fields; and our money was seven annas and six\r\npie. There was a famine in the land. I do not know the name of the land.\r\nSo, on a night when we were sleeping, my brother took the five annas\r\nthat remained to us and ran away. I do not know whither he went. The\r\ncurse of my father be upon him. But I and the sister begged food in\r\nthe villages, and there was none to give. Only all men said--“Go to the\r\nEnglishmen and they will give.” I did not know what the Englishmen were;\r\nbut they said that they were white, living in tents. I went forward; but\r\nI cannot say whither I went, and there was no more food for myself or\r\nthe sister. And upon a hot night, she weeping and calling for food, we\r\ncame to a well, and I bade her sit upon the kerb, and thrust her in,\r\nfor, in truth, she could not see; and it is better to die than to\r\nstarve.’\r\n\r\n‘Ai! Ahi!’ wailed the grooms’ wives in chorus; ‘he thrust her in, for it\r\nis better to die than to starve!’\r\n\r\n‘I would have thrown myself in also, but that she was not dead and\r\ncalled to me from the bottom of the well, and I was afraid and ran. And\r\none came out of the crops saying that I had killed her and defiled the\r\nwell, and they took me before an Englishman, white and terrible, living\r\nin a tent, and me he sent here. But there were no witnesses, and it is\r\nbetter to die than to starve. She, furthermore, could not see with her\r\neyes, and was but a little child.’\r\n\r\n‘Was but a little child,’ echoed the Head Groom’s wife. ‘But who art\r\nthou, weak as a fowl and small as a day-old colt, what art THOU?’\r\n\r\n‘I who was empty am now full,’ said Little Tobrah, stretching himself\r\nupon the dust. ‘And I would sleep.’\r\n\r\nThe groom’s wife spread a cloth over him while Little Tobrah slept the\r\nsleep of the just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUBBLING WELL ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLook out on a large scale map the place where the Chenab river falls\r\ninto the Indus fifteen miles or so above the hamlet of Chachuran. Five\r\nmiles west of Chachuran lies Bubbling Well Road, and the house of the\r\ngosain or priest of Arti-goth. It was the priest who showed me the road,\r\nbut it is no thanks to him that I am able to tell this story.\r\n\r\nFive miles west of Chachuran is a patch of the plumed jungle-grass, that\r\nturns over in silver when the wind blows, from ten to twenty feet high\r\nand from three to four miles square. In the heart of the patch hides the\r\ngosain of Bubbling Well Road. The villagers stone him when he peers\r\ninto the daylight, although he is a priest, and he runs back again as\r\na strayed wolf turns into tall crops. He is a one-eyed man and carries,\r\nburnt between his brows, the impress of two copper coins. Some say that\r\nhe was tortured by a native prince in the old days; for he is so old\r\nthat he must have been capable of mischief in the days of Runjit Singh.\r\nHis most pressing need at present is a halter, and the care of the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nThese things happened when the jungle-grass was tall; and the villagers\r\nof Chachuran told me that a sounder of pig had gone into the Arti-goth\r\npatch. To enter jungle-grass is always an unwise proceeding, but I went,\r\npartly because I knew nothing of pig-hunting, and partly because the\r\nvillagers said that the big boar of the sounder owned foot long tushes.\r\nTherefore I wished to shoot him, in order to produce the tushes in after\r\nyears, and say that I had ridden him down in fair chase. I took a gun\r\nand went into the hot, close patch, believing that it would be an easy\r\nthing to unearth one pig in ten square miles of jungle. Mr. Wardle,\r\nthe terrier, went with me because he believed that I was incapable of\r\nexisting for an hour without his advice and countenance. He managed to\r\nslip in and out between the grass clumps, but I had to force my way,\r\nand in twenty minutes was as completely lost as though I had been in the\r\nheart of Central Africa. I did not notice this at first till I had grown\r\nwearied of stumbling and pushing through the grass, and Mr. Wardle was\r\nbeginning to sit down very often and hang out his tongue very far. There\r\nwas nothing but grass everywhere, and it was impossible to see two yards\r\nin any direction. The grass-stems held the heat exactly as boiler-tubes\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIn half-an-hour, when I was devoutly wishing that I had left the big\r\nboar alone, I came to a narrow path which seemed to be a compromise\r\nbetween a native foot-path and a pig-run. It was barely six inches wide,\r\nbut I could sidle along it in comfort. The grass was extremely thick\r\nhere, and where the path was ill defined it was necessary to crush into\r\nthe tussocks either with both hands before the face, or to back into\r\nit, leaving both hands free to manage the rifle. None the less it was a\r\npath, and valuable because it might lead to a place.\r\n\r\nAt the end of nearly fifty yards of fair way, just when I was preparing\r\nto back into an unusually stiff tussock, I missed Mr. Wardle, who for\r\nhis girth is an unusually frivolous dog and never keeps to heel. I\r\ncalled him three times and said aloud, ‘Where has the little beast gone\r\nto?’ Then I stepped backwards several paces, for almost under my feet a\r\ndeep voice repeated, ‘Where has the little beast gone?’ To appreciate an\r\nunseen voice thoroughly you should hear it when you are lost in stifling\r\njungle-grass. I called Mr. Wardle again and the underground echo\r\nassisted me. At that I ceased calling and listened very attentively,\r\nbecause I thought I heard a man laughing in a peculiarly offensive\r\nmanner. The heat made me sweat, but the laughter made me shake. There is\r\nno earthly need for laughter in high grass. It is indecent, as well as\r\nimpolite. The chuckling stopped, and I took courage and continued to\r\ncall till I thought that I had located the echo somewhere behind and\r\nbelow the tussock into which I was preparing to back just before I lost\r\nMr. Wardle. I drove my rifle up to the triggers, between the grass-stems\r\nin a downward and forward direction. Then I waggled it to and fro, but\r\nit did not seem to touch ground on the far side of the tussock as it\r\nshould have done. Every time that I grunted with the exertion of driving\r\na heavy rifle through thick grass, the grunt was faithfully repeated\r\nfrom below, and when I stopped to wipe my face the sound of low laughter\r\nwas distinct beyond doubting.\r\n\r\nI went into the tussock, face first, an inch at a time, my mouth\r\nopen and my eyes fine, full, and prominent. When I had overcome the\r\nresistance of the grass I found that I was looking straight across a\r\nblack gap in the ground--that I was actually lying on my chest leaning\r\nover the mouth of a well so deep I could scarcely see the water in it.\r\n\r\nThere were things in the water,--black things,--and the water was as\r\nblack as pitch with blue scum atop. The laughing sound came from the\r\nnoise of a little spring, spouting half-way down one side of the well.\r\nSometimes as the black things circled round, the trickle from the spring\r\nfell upon their tightly-stretched skins, and then the laughter changed\r\ninto a sputter of mirth. One thing turned over on its back, as I\r\nwatched, and drifted round and round the circle of the mossy brickwork\r\nwith a hand and half an arm held clear of the water in a stiff and\r\nhorrible flourish, as though it were a very wearied guide paid to\r\nexhibit the beauties of the place.\r\n\r\nI did not spend more than half-an-hour in creeping round that well\r\nand finding the path on the other side. The remainder of the journey\r\nI accomplished by feeling every foot of ground in front of me, and\r\ncrawling like a snail through every tussock. I carried Mr. Wardle in my\r\narms and he licked my nose. He was not frightened in the least, nor was\r\nI, but we wished to reach open ground in order to enjoy the view. My\r\nknees were loose, and the apple in my throat refused to slide up and\r\ndown. The path on the far side of the well was a very good one, though\r\nboxed in on all sides by grass, and it led me in time to a priest’s hut\r\nin the centre of a little clearing. When that priest saw my very white\r\nface coming through the grass he howled with terror and embraced my\r\nboots; but when I reached the bedstead set outside his door I sat down\r\nquickly and Mr. Wardle mounted guard over me. I was not in a condition\r\nto take care of myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke I told the priest to lead me into the open, out of the\r\nArti-goth patch, and to walk slowly in front of me. Mr. Wardle hates\r\nnatives, and the priest was more afraid of Mr. Wardle than of me, though\r\nwe were both angry. He walked very slowly down a narrow little path from\r\nhis hut. That path crossed three paths, such as the one I had come by\r\nin the first instance, and every one of the three headed towards the\r\nBubbling Well. Once when we stopped to draw breath, I heard the Well\r\nlaughing to itself alone in the thick grass, and only my need for his\r\nservices prevented my firing both barrels into the priest’s back.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the open the priest crashed back into cover, and I went\r\nto the village of Arti-goth for a drink. It was pleasant to be able to\r\nsee the horizon all round, as well as the ground underfoot.\r\n\r\nThe villagers told me that the patch of grass was full of devils and\r\nghosts, all in the service of the priest, and that men and women and\r\nchildren had entered it and had never returned. They said the priest\r\nused their livers for purposes of witchcraft. When I asked why they had\r\nnot told me of this at the outset, they said that they were afraid they\r\nwould lose their reward for bringing news of the pig.\r\n\r\nBefore I left I did my best to set the patch alight, but the grass was\r\ntoo green. Some fine summer day, however, if the wind is favourable, a\r\nfile of old newspapers and a box of matches will make clear the mystery\r\nof Bubbling Well Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT’\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &\r\nCo.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dense wet heat that hung over the face of land, like a blanket,\r\nprevented all hope of sleep in the first instance. The cicalas helped\r\nthe heat; and the yelling jackals the cicalas. It was impossible to sit\r\nstill in the dark, empty, echoing house and watch the punkah beat the\r\ndead air. So, at ten o’clock of the night, I set my walking-stick on\r\nend in the middle of the garden, and waited to see how it would fall.\r\nIt pointed directly down the moonlit road that leads to the City of\r\nDreadful Night. The sound of its fall disturbed a hare. She limped from\r\nher form and ran across to a disused Mahomedan burial-ground, where the\r\njawless skulls and rough-butted shank-bones, heartlessly exposed by the\r\nJuly rains, glimmered like mother o’ pearl on the rain-channelled soil.\r\nThe heated air and the heavy earth had driven the very dead upward for\r\ncoolness’ sake. The hare limped on; snuffed curiously at a fragment of\r\na smoke-stained lamp-shard, and died out, in the shadow of a clump of\r\ntamarisk trees.\r\n\r\nThe mat-weaver’s hut under the lee of the Hindu temple was full of\r\nsleeping men who lay like sheeted corpses. Overhead blazed the unwinking\r\neye of the Moon. Darkness gives at least a false impression of coolness.\r\nIt was hard not to believe that the flood of light from above was warm.\r\nNot so hot as the Sun, but still sickly warm, and heating the heavy air\r\nbeyond what was our due. Straight as a bar of polished steel ran the\r\nroad to the City of Dreadful Night; and on either side of the road lay\r\ncorpses disposed on beds in fantastic attitudes--one hundred and seventy\r\nbodies of men. Some shrouded all in white with bound-up mouths; some\r\nnaked and black as ebony in the strong light; and one--that lay face\r\nupwards with dropped jaw, far away from the others--silvery white and\r\nashen gray.\r\n\r\n‘A leper asleep; and the remainder wearied coolies, servants, small\r\nshopkeepers, and drivers from the hackstand hard by. The scene--a main\r\napproach to Lahore city, and the night a warm one in August.’ This was\r\nall that there was to be seen; but by no means all that one could see.\r\nThe witchery of the moonlight was everywhere; and the world was horribly\r\nchanged. The long line of the naked dead, flanked by the rigid silver\r\nstatue, was not pleasant to look upon. It was made up of men alone.\r\nWere the womenkind, then, forced to sleep in the shelter of the stifling\r\nmud-huts as best they might? The fretful wail of a child from a low\r\nmud-roof answered the question. Where the children are the mothers must\r\nbe also to look after them. They need care on these sweltering nights. A\r\nblack little bullet-head peeped over the coping, and a thin--a painfully\r\nthin--brown leg was slid over on to the gutter pipe. There was a sharp\r\nclink of glass bracelets; a woman’s arm showed for an instant above the\r\nparapet, twined itself round the lean little neck, and the child was\r\ndragged back, protesting, to the shelter of the bedstead. His thin,\r\nhigh-pitched shriek died out in the thick air almost as soon as it was\r\nraised; for even the children of the soil found it too hot to weep.\r\n\r\nMore corpses; more stretches of moonlit, white road, a string of\r\nsleeping camels at rest by the wayside; a vision of scudding jackals;\r\nekka-ponies asleep--the harness still on their backs, and the\r\nbrass-studded country carts, winking in the moonlight--and again more\r\ncorpses. Wherever a grain cart atilt, a tree trunk, a sawn log, a couple\r\nof bamboos and a few handfuls of thatch cast a shadow, the ground is\r\ncovered with them. They lie--some face downwards, arms folded, in the\r\ndust; some with clasped hands flung up above their heads; some curled\r\nup dog-wise; some thrown like limp gunny-bags over the side of the grain\r\ncarts; and some bowed with their brows on their knees in the full glare\r\nof the Moon. It would be a comfort if they were only given to snoring;\r\nbut they are not, and the likeness to corpses is unbroken in all\r\nrespects save one. The lean dogs snuff at them and turn away. Here and\r\nthere a tiny child lies on his father’s bedstead, and a protecting\r\narm is thrown round it in every instance. But, for the most part, the\r\nchildren sleep with their mothers on the house-tops. Yellow-skinned\r\nwhite-toothed pariahs are not to be trusted within reach of brown\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nA stifling hot blast from the mouth of the Delhi Gate nearly ends my\r\nresolution of entering the City of Dreadful Night at this hour. It is a\r\ncompound of all evil savours, animal and vegetable, that a walled city\r\ncan brew in a day and a night. The temperature within the motionless\r\ngroves of plantain and orange-trees outside the city walls seems chilly\r\nby comparison. Heaven help all sick persons and young children within\r\nthe city to-night! The high house-walls are still radiating heat\r\nsavagely, and from obscure side gullies fetid breezes eddy that ought\r\nto poison a buffalo. But the buffaloes do not heed. A drove of them\r\nare parading the vacant main street; stopping now and then to lay their\r\nponderous muzzles against the closed shutters of a grain-dealer’s shops\r\nand to blow thereon like grampuses.\r\n\r\nThen silence follows--the silence that is full of the night noises of a\r\ngreat city. A stringed instrument of some kind is just, and only just,\r\naudible. High overhead some one throws open a window, and the rattle\r\nof the wood-work echoes down the empty street. On one of the roofs,\r\na hookah is in full blast; and the men are talking softly as the\r\npipe gutters. A little farther on, the noise of conversation is more\r\ndistinct. A slit of light shows itself between the sliding shutters of\r\na shop. Inside, a stubble-bearded, weary-eyed trader is balancing his\r\naccount-books among the bales of cotton prints that surround him. Three\r\nsheeted figures bear him company, and throw in a remark from time to\r\ntime. First he makes an entry, then a remark; then passes the back of\r\nhis hand across his streaming forehead. The heat in the built-in street\r\nis fearful. Inside the shops it must be almost unendurable. But the\r\nwork goes on steadily; entry, guttural growl, and uplifted hand-stroke\r\nsucceeding each other with the precision of clock-work.\r\n\r\nA policeman--turbanless and fast asleep--lies across the road on the\r\nway to the Mosque of Wazir Khan. A bar of moonlight falls across the\r\nforehead and eyes of the sleeper, but he never stirs. It is close upon\r\nmidnight, and the heat seems to be increasing. The open square in front\r\nof the Mosque is crowded with corpses; and a man must pick his way\r\ncarefully for fear of treading on them. The moonlight stripes the\r\nMosque’s high front of coloured enamel work in broad diagonal bands; and\r\neach separate dreaming pigeon in the niches and corners of the masonry\r\nthrows a squab little shadow. Sheeted ghosts rise up wearily from their\r\npallets, and flit into the dark depths of the building. Is it possible\r\nto climb to the top of the great Minars, and thence to look down on the\r\ncity? At all events the attempt is worth making, and the chances are\r\nthat the door of the staircase will be unlocked. Unlocked it is; but a\r\ndeeply sleeping janitor lies across the threshold, face turned to\r\nthe Moon. A rat dashes out of his turban at the sound of approaching\r\nfootsteps. The man grunts, opens his eyes for a minute, turns round, and\r\ngoes to sleep again. All the heat of a decade of fierce Indian summers\r\nis stored in the pitch-black, polished walls of the corkscrew staircase.\r\nHalf-way up, there is something alive, warm, and feathery; and it\r\nsnores. Driven from step to step as it catches the sound of my advance,\r\nit flutters to the top and reveals itself as a yellow-eyed, angry kite.\r\nDozens of kites are asleep on this and the other Minars, and on the\r\ndomes below. There is the shadow of a cool, or at least a less sultry\r\nbreeze at this height; and, refreshed thereby, turn to look on the City\r\nof Dreadful Night.\r\n\r\nDore might have drawn it! Zola could describe it--this spectacle of\r\nsleeping thousands in the moonlight and in the shadow of the Moon. The\r\nroof-tops are crammed with men, women, and children; and the air is full\r\nof undistinguishable noises. They are restless in the City of Dreadful\r\nNight; and small wonder. The marvel is that they can even breathe. If\r\nyou gaze intently at the multitude, you can see that they are almost as\r\nuneasy as a daylight crowd; but the tumult is subdued. Everywhere,\r\nin the strong light, you can watch the sleepers turning to and\r\nfro; shifting their beds and again resettling them. In the pit-like\r\ncourt-yards of the houses there is the same movement.\r\n\r\nThe pitiless Moon shows it all. Shows, too, the plains outside the city,\r\nand here and there a hand’s-breadth of the Ravee without the walls.\r\nShows lastly, a splash of glittering silver on a house-top almost\r\ndirectly below the mosque Minar. Some poor soul has risen to throw a jar\r\nof water over his fevered body; the tinkle of the falling water strikes\r\nfaintly on the ear. Two or three other men, in far-off corners of the\r\nCity of Dreadful Night, follow his example, and the water flashes like\r\nheliographic signals. A small cloud passes over the face of the Moon,\r\nand the city and its inhabitants--clear drawn in black and white\r\nbefore--fade into masses of black and deeper black. Still the unrestful\r\nnoise continues, the sigh of a great city overwhelmed with the heat, and\r\nof a people seeking in vain for rest. It is only the lower-class women\r\nwho sleep on the house-tops. What must the torment be in the latticed\r\nzenanas, where a few lamps are still twinkling? There are footfalls in\r\nthe court below. It is the Muezzin--faithful minister; but he ought to\r\nhave been here an hour ago to tell the Faithful that prayer is better\r\nthan sleep--the sleep that will not come to the city.\r\n\r\nThe Muezzin fumbles for a moment with the door of one of the\r\nMinars, disappears awhile, and a bull-like roar--a magnificent bass\r\nthunder--tells that he has reached the top of the Minar. They must\r\nhear the cry to the banks of the shrunken Ravee itself! Even across the\r\ncourtyard it is almost overpowering. The cloud drifts by and shows him\r\noutlined in black against the sky, hands laid upon his ears, and broad\r\nchest heaving with the play of his lungs--‘Allah ho Akbar’; then a pause\r\nwhile another Muezzin somewhere in the direction of the Golden Temple\r\ntakes up the call--‘Allah ho Akbar.’ Again and again; four times in\r\nall; and from the bedsteads a dozen men have risen up already.--‘I bear\r\nwitness that there is no God but God.’ What a splendid cry it is, the\r\nproclamation of the creed that brings men out of their beds by scores at\r\nmidnight! Once again he thunders through the same phrase, shaking with\r\nthe vehemence of his own voice; and then, far and near, the night air\r\nrings with ‘Mahomed is the Prophet of God.’ It is as though he were\r\nflinging his defiance to the far-off horizon, where the summer lightning\r\nplays and leaps like a bared sword. Every Muezzin in the city is in full\r\ncry, and some men on the roof-tops are beginning to kneel. A long pause\r\nprecedes the last cry, ‘La ilaha Illallah,’ and the silence closes up on\r\nit, as the ram on the head of a cotton-bale.\r\n\r\nThe Muezzin stumbles down the dark stairway grumbling in his beard.\r\nHe passes the arch of the entrance and disappears. Then the stifling\r\nsilence settles down over the City of Dreadful Night. The kites on the\r\nMinar sleep again, snoring more loudly, the hot breeze comes up in puffs\r\nand lazy eddies, and the Moon slides down towards the horizon. Seated\r\nwith both elbows on the parapet of the tower, one can watch and wonder\r\nover that heat-tortured hive till the dawn. ‘How do they live down\r\nthere? What do they think of? When will they awake?’ More tinkling of\r\nsluiced water-pots; faint jarring of wooden bedsteads moved into or\r\nout of the shadows; uncouth music of stringed instruments softened by\r\ndistance into a plaintive wail, and one low grumble of far-off thunder.\r\nIn the courtyard of the mosque the janitor, who lay across the threshold\r\nof the Minar when I came up, starts wildly in his sleep, throws his\r\nhands above his head, mutters something, and falls back again. Lulled by\r\nthe snoring of the kites--they snore like over-gorged humans--I drop off\r\ninto an uneasy doze, conscious that three o’clock has struck, and that\r\nthere is a slight--a very slight--coolness in the atmosphere. The city\r\nis absolutely quiet now, but for some vagrant dog’s love-song. Nothing\r\nsave dead heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks of darkness pass after this. For the Moon has gone out.\r\nThe very dogs are still, and I watch for the first light of the dawn\r\nbefore making my way homeward. Again the noise of shuffling feet. The\r\nmorning call is about to begin, and my night watch is over. ‘Allah ho\r\nAkbar! Allah ho Akbar!’ The east grows gray, and presently saffron; the\r\ndawn wind comes up as though the Muezzin had summoned it; and, as one\r\nman, the City of Dreadful Night rises from its bed and turns its face\r\ntowards the dawning day. With return of life comes return of sound.\r\nFirst a low whisper, then a deep bass hum; for it must be remembered\r\nthat the entire city is on the house-tops. My eyelids weighed down with\r\nthe arrears of long deferred sleep, I escape from the Minar through the\r\ncourtyard and out into the square beyond, where the sleepers have risen,\r\nstowed away the bedsteads, and are discussing the morning hookah. The\r\nminute’s freshness of the air has gone, and it is as hot as at first.\r\n\r\n‘Will the Sahib, out of his kindness, make room?’ What is it? Something\r\nborne on men’s shoulders comes by in the half-light, and I stand back.\r\nA woman’s corpse going down to the burning-ghat, and a bystander says,\r\n‘She died at midnight from the heat.’ So the city was of Death as well\r\nas Night after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIE PORGIE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Georgie Porgie, pudding and pie,\r\n     Kissed the girls and made them cry.\r\n     When the girls came out to play\r\n     Georgie Porgie ran away.\r\n\r\nIf you will admit that a man has no right to enter his drawing-room\r\nearly in the morning, when the housemaid is setting things right and\r\nclearing away the dust, you will concede that civilised people who eat\r\nout of china and own card-cases have no right to apply their standard\r\nof right and wrong to an unsettled land. When the place is made fit for\r\ntheir reception, by those men who are told off to the work, they can\r\ncome up, bringing in their trunks their own society and the Decalogue,\r\nand all the other apparatus. Where the Queen’s Law does not carry, it\r\nis irrational to expect an observance of other and weaker rules. The men\r\nwho run ahead of the cars of Decency and Propriety, and make the jungle\r\nways straight, cannot be judged in the same manner as the stay-at-home\r\nfolk of the ranks of the regular Tchin.\r\n\r\nNot many months ago the Queen’s Law stopped a few miles north of\r\nThayetmyo on the Irrawaddy. There was no very strong Public Opinion up\r\nto that limit, but it existed to keep men in order. When the Government\r\nsaid that the Queen’s Law must carry up to Bhamo and the Chinese border\r\nthe order was given, and some men whose desire was to be ever a little\r\nin advance of the rush of Respectability flocked forward with the\r\ntroops. These were the men who could never pass examinations, and\r\nwould have been too pronounced in their ideas for the administration of\r\nbureau-worked Provinces. The Supreme Government stepped in as soon as\r\nmight be, with codes and regulations, and all but reduced New Burma to\r\nthe dead Indian level; but there was a short time during which strong\r\nmen were necessary and ploughed a field for themselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the fore-runners of Civilisation was Georgie Porgie, reckoned by\r\nall who knew him a strong man. He held an appointment in Lower Burma\r\nwhen the order came to break the Frontier, and his friends called him\r\nGeorgie Porgie because of the singularly Burmese-like manner in which\r\nhe sang a song whose first line is something like the words ‘Georgie\r\nPorgie.’ Most men who have been in Burma will know the song. It means:\r\n‘Puff, puff, puff, puff, great steamboat!’ Georgie sang it to his banjo,\r\nand his friends shouted with delight, so that you could hear them far\r\naway in the teak-forest.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to Upper Burma he had no special regard for God or Man,\r\nbut he knew how to make himself respected, and to carry out the mixed\r\nMilitary-Civil duties that fell to most men’s share in those months. He\r\ndid his office work and entertained, now and again, the detachments of\r\nfever-shaken soldiers who blundered through his part of the world in\r\nsearch of a flying party of dacoits. Sometimes he turned out and dressed\r\ndown dacoits on his own account; for the country was still smouldering\r\nand would blaze when least expected. He enjoyed these charivaris, but\r\nthe dacoits were not so amused. All the officials who came in contact\r\nwith him departed with the idea that Georgie Porgie was a valuable\r\nperson, well able to take care of himself, and, on that belief, he was\r\nleft to his own devices.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few months he wearied of his solitude, and cast about\r\nfor company and refinement. The Queen’s Law had hardly begun to be felt\r\nin the country, and Public Opinion, which is more powerful than the\r\nQueen’s Law, had yet to come. Also, there was a custom in the country\r\nwhich allowed a white man to take to himself a wife of the Daughters of\r\nHeth upon due payment. The marriage was not quite so binding as is the\r\nnikkah ceremony among Mahomedans, but the wife was very pleasant.\r\n\r\nWhen all our troops are back from Burma there will be a proverb in their\r\nmouths, ‘As thrifty as a Burmese wife,’ and pretty English ladies will\r\nwonder what in the world it means.\r\n\r\nThe headman of the village next to Georgie Porgie’s post had a fair\r\ndaughter who had seen Georgie Porgie and loved him from afar. When news\r\nwent abroad that the Englishman with the heavy hand who lived in\r\nthe stockade was looking for a housekeeper, the headman came in and\r\nexplained that, for five hundred rupees down, he would entrust his\r\ndaughter to Georgie Porgie’s keeping, to be maintained in all honour,\r\nrespect, and comfort, with pretty dresses, according to the custom of\r\nthe country. This thing was done, and Georgie Porgie never repented it.\r\n\r\nHe found his rough-and-tumble house put straight and made comfortable,\r\nhis hitherto unchecked expenses cut down by one half, and himself petted\r\nand made much of by his new acquisition, who sat at the head of his\r\ntable and sang songs to him and ordered his Madrassee servants about,\r\nand was in every way as sweet and merry and honest and winning a little\r\nwoman as the most exacting of bachelors could have desired. No race, men\r\nsay who know, produces such good wives and heads of households as\r\nthe Burmese. When the next detachment tramped by on the war-path the\r\nSubaltern in Command found at Georgie Porgie’s table a hostess to be\r\ndeferential to, a woman to be treated in every way as one occupying\r\nan assured position. When he gathered his men together next dawn and\r\nreplunged into the jungle he thought regretfully of the nice little\r\ndinner and the pretty face, and envied Georgie Porgie from the bottom\r\nof his heart. Yet HE was engaged to a girl at Home, and that is how some\r\nmen are constructed.\r\n\r\nThe Burmese girl’s name was not a pretty one; but as she was promptly\r\nchristened Georgina by Georgie Porgie, the blemish did not matter.\r\nGeorgie Porgie thought well of the petting and the general comfort, and\r\nvowed that he had never spent five hundred rupees to a better end.\r\n\r\nAfter three months of domestic life, a great idea struck him.\r\nMatrimony--English matrimony--could not be such a bad thing after all.\r\nIf he were so thoroughly comfortable at the Back of Beyond with this\r\nBurmese girl who smoked cheroots, how much more comfortable would he be\r\nwith a sweet English maiden who would not smoke cheroots, and would play\r\nupon a piano instead of a banjo? Also he had a desire to return to\r\nhis kind, to hear a Band once more, and to feel how it felt to wear a\r\ndress-suit again. Decidedly, Matrimony would be a very good thing. He\r\nthought the matter out at length of evenings, while Georgina sang\r\nto him, or asked him why he was so silent, and whether she had done\r\nanything to offend him. As he thought, he smoked, and as he smoked he\r\nlooked at Georgina, and in his fancy turned her into a fair, thrifty,\r\namusing, merry, little English girl, with hair coming low down on her\r\nforehead, and perhaps a cigarette between her lips. Certainly, not a\r\nbig, thick, Burma cheroot, of the brand that Georgina smoked. He would\r\nwed a girl with Georgina’s eyes and most of her ways. But not all. She\r\ncould be improved upon. Then he blew thick smoke-wreaths through his\r\nnostrils and stretched himself. He would taste marriage. Georgina had\r\nhelped him to save money, and there were six months’ leave due to him.\r\n\r\n‘See here, little woman,’ he said, ‘we must put by more money for these\r\nnext three months. I want it.’ That was a direct slur on Georgina’s\r\nhousekeeping; for she prided herself on her thrift; but since her God\r\nwanted money she would do her best.\r\n\r\n‘You want money?’ she said with a little laugh. ‘I HAVE money. Look!’\r\nShe ran to her own room and fetched out a small bag of rupees. ‘Of all\r\nthat you give me, I keep back some. See! One hundred and seven rupees.\r\nCan you want more money than that? Take it. It is my pleasure if you use\r\nit.’ She spread out the money on the table and pushed it towards him,\r\nwith her quick, little, pale yellow fingers.\r\n\r\nGeorgie Porgie never referred to economy in the household again.\r\n\r\nThree months later, after the dispatch and receipt of several mysterious\r\nletters which Georgina could not understand, and hated for that reason,\r\nGeorgie Porgie said that he was going away and she must return to her\r\nfather’s house and stay there.\r\n\r\nGeorgina wept. She would go with her God from the world’s end to the\r\nworld’s end. Why should she leave him? She loved him.\r\n\r\n‘I am only going to Rangoon,’ said Georgie Porgie. ‘I shall be back in\r\na month, but it is safer to stay with your father. I will leave you two\r\nhundred rupees.’\r\n\r\n‘If you go for a month, what need of two hundred? Fifty are more than\r\nenough. There is some evil here. Do not go, or at least let me go with\r\nyou.’\r\n\r\nGeorgie Porgie does not like to remember that scene even at this date.\r\nIn the end he got rid of Georgina by a compromise of seventy-five\r\nrupees. She would not take more. Then he went by steamer and rail to\r\nRangoon.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious letters had granted him six months’ leave. The actual\r\nflight and an idea that he might have been treacherous hurt severely\r\nat the time, but as soon as the big steamer was well out into the blue,\r\nthings were easier, and Georgina’s face, and the queer little stockaded\r\nhouse, and the memory of the rushes of shouting dacoits by night, the\r\ncry and struggle of the first man that he had ever killed with his own\r\nhand, and a hundred other more intimate things, faded and faded out of\r\nGeorgie Porgie’s heart, and the vision of approaching England took its\r\nplace. The steamer was full of men on leave, all rampantly jovial souls\r\nwho had shaken off the dust and sweat of Upper Burma and were as merry\r\nas schoolboys. They helped Georgie Porgie to forget.\r\n\r\nThen came England with its luxuries and decencies and comforts, and\r\nGeorgie Porgie walked in a pleasant dream upon pavements of which he had\r\nnearly forgotten the ring, wondering why men in their senses ever left\r\nTown. He accepted his keen delight in his furlough as the reward of\r\nhis services. Providence further arranged for him another and greater\r\ndelight--all the pleasures of a quiet English wooing, quite different\r\nfrom the brazen businesses of the East, when half the community\r\nstand back and bet on the result, and the other half wonder what Mrs.\r\nSo-and-So will say to it.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant girl and a perfect summer, and a big country-house\r\nnear Petworth where there are acres and acres of purple heather and\r\nhigh-grassed water-meadows to wander through. Georgie Porgie felt that\r\nhe had at last found something worth the living for, and naturally\r\nassumed that the next thing to do was to ask the girl to share his life\r\nin India. She, in her ignorance, was willing to go. On this occasion\r\nthere was no bartering with a village headman. There was a fine\r\nmiddle-class wedding in the country, with a stout Papa and a weeping\r\nMamma, and a best-man in purple and fine linen, and six snub-nosed girls\r\nfrom the Sunday School to throw roses on the path between the tombstones\r\nup to the Church door. The local paper described the affair at great\r\nlength, even down to giving the hymns in full. But that was because the\r\nDirection were starving for want of material.\r\n\r\nThen came a honeymoon at Arundel, and the Mamma wept copiously before\r\nshe allowed her one daughter to sail away to India under the care of\r\nGeorgie Porgie the Bridegroom. Beyond any question, Georgie Porgie was\r\nimmensely fond of his wife, and she was devoted to him as the best and\r\ngreatest man in the world. When he reported himself at Bombay he felt\r\njustified in demanding a good station for his wife’s sake; and, because\r\nhe had made a little mark in Burma and was beginning to be appreciated,\r\nthey allowed him nearly all that he asked for, and posted him to a\r\nstation which we will call Sutrain. It stood upon several hills, and was\r\nstyled officially a ‘Sanitarium,’ for the good reason that the drainage\r\nwas utterly neglected. Here Georgie Porgie settled down, and found\r\nmarried life come very naturally to him. He did not rave, as do many\r\nbridegrooms, over the strangeness and delight of seeing his own true\r\nlove sitting down to breakfast with him every morning ‘as though it were\r\nthe most natural thing in the world.’\r\n\r\n‘He had been there before,’ as the Americans say, and, checking the\r\nmerits of his own present Grace by those of Georgina, he was more and\r\nmore inclined to think that he had done well.\r\n\r\nBut there was no peace or comfort across the Bay of Bengal, under the\r\nteak-trees where Georgina lived with her father, waiting for Georgie\r\nPorgie to return. The headman was old, and remembered the war of ‘51.\r\nHe had been to Rangoon, and knew something of the ways of the Kullahs.\r\nSitting in front of his door in the evenings, he taught Georgina a dry\r\nphilosophy which did not console her in the least.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that she loved Georgie Porgie just as much as the French\r\ngirl in the English History books loved the priest whose head was broken\r\nby the king’s bullies. One day she disappeared from the village with\r\nall the rupees that Georgie Porgie had given her, and a very small\r\nsmattering of English--also gained from Georgie Porgie.\r\n\r\nThe headman was angry at first, but lit a fresh cheroot and said\r\nsomething uncomplimentary about the sex in general. Georgina had started\r\non a search for Georgie Porgie, who might be in Rangoon, or across the\r\nBlack Water, or dead, for aught that she knew. Chance favoured her. An\r\nold Sikh policeman told her that Georgie Porgie had crossed the Black\r\nWater. She took a steerage-passage from Rangoon and went to Calcutta;\r\nkeeping the secret of her search to herself.\r\n\r\nIn India every trace of her was lost for six weeks, and no one knows\r\nwhat trouble of heart she must have undergone.\r\n\r\nShe reappeared, four hundred miles north of Calcutta, steadily heading\r\nnorthwards, very worn and haggard, but very fixed in her determination\r\nto find Georgie Porgie. She could not understand the language of the\r\npeople; but India is infinitely charitable, and the women-folk along\r\nthe Grand Trunk gave her food. Something made her believe that Georgie\r\nPorgie was to be found at the end of that pitiless road. She may have\r\nseen a sepoy who knew him in Burma, but of this no one can be certain.\r\nAt last, she found a regiment on the line of march, and met there one\r\nof the many subalterns whom Georgie Porgie had invited to dinner in the\r\nfar-off, old days of the dacoit-hunting. There was a certain amount of\r\namusement among the tents when Georgina threw herself at the man’s feet\r\nand began to cry. There was no amusement when her story was told; but\r\na collection was made, and that was more to the point. One of the\r\nsubalterns knew of Georgie Porgie’s whereabouts, but not of his\r\nmarriage. So he told Georgina and she went her way joyfully to the\r\nnorth, in a railway carriage where there was rest for tired feet and\r\nshade for a dusty little head. The marches from the train through the\r\nhills into Sutrain were trying, but Georgina had money, and families\r\njourneying in bullock-carts gave her help. It was an almost miraculous\r\njourney, and Georgina felt sure that the good spirits of Burma were\r\nlooking after her. The hill-road to Sutrain is a chilly stretch, and\r\nGeorgina caught a bad cold. Still there was Georgie Porgie at the end of\r\nall the trouble to take her up in his arms and pet her, as he used to\r\ndo in the old days when the stockade was shut for the night and he\r\nhad approved of the evening meal. Georgina went forward as fast as she\r\ncould; and her good spirits did her one last favour.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman stopped her, in the twilight, just at the turn of the road\r\ninto Sutrain, saying, ‘Good Heavens! What are you doing here?’\r\n\r\nHe was Gillis, the man who had been Georgie Porgie’s assistant in Upper\r\nBurma, and who occupied the next post to Georgie Porgie’s in the jungle.\r\nGeorgie Porgie had applied to have him to work with at Sutrain because\r\nhe liked him.\r\n\r\n‘I have come,’ said Georgina simply. ‘It was such a long way, and I have\r\nbeen months in coming. Where is his house?’\r\n\r\nGillis gasped. He had seen enough of Georgina in the old times to know\r\nthat explanations would be useless. You cannot explain things to the\r\nOriental. You must show.\r\n\r\n‘I’ll take you there,’ said Gillis, and he led Georgina off the road, up\r\nthe cliff, by a little pathway, to the back of a house set on a platform\r\ncut into the hillside.\r\n\r\nThe lamps were just lit, but the curtains were not drawn. ‘Now look,’\r\nsaid Gillis, stopping in front of the drawing-room window. Georgina\r\nlooked and saw Georgie Porgie and the Bride.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand up to her hair, which had come out of its top-knot\r\nand was straggling about her face. She tried to set her ragged dress in\r\norder, but the dress was past pulling straight, and she coughed a queer\r\nlittle cough, for she really had taken a very bad cold. Gillis looked,\r\ntoo, but while Georgina only looked at the Bride once, turning her eyes\r\nalways on Georgie Porgie, Gillis looked at the Bride all the time.\r\n\r\n‘What are you going to do?’ said Gillis, who held Georgina by the wrist,\r\nin case of any unexpected rush into the lamplight. ‘Will you go in and\r\ntell that English woman that you lived with her husband?’\r\n\r\n‘No,’ said Georgina faintly. ‘Let me go. I am going away. I swear that I\r\nam going away.’ She twisted herself free and ran off into the dark.\r\n\r\n‘Poor little beast!’ said Gillis, dropping on to the main road. ‘I’d\r\nha’ given her something to get back to Burma with. What a narrow shave\r\nthough! And that angel would never have forgiven it.’\r\n\r\nThis seems to prove that the devotion of Gillis was not entirely due to\r\nhis affection for Georgie Porgie.\r\n\r\nThe Bride and the Bridegroom came out into the verandah after dinner, in\r\norder that the smoke of Georgie Porgie’s cheroots might not hang in the\r\nnew drawing-room curtains.\r\n\r\n‘What is that noise down there?’ said the Bride. Both listened.\r\n\r\n‘Oh,’ said Georgie Porgie, ‘I suppose some brute of a hillman has been\r\nbeating his wife.’\r\n\r\n‘Beating--his--wife! How ghastly!’ said the Bride. ‘Fancy YOUR beating\r\nME!’ She slipped an arm round her husband’s waist, and, leaning her head\r\nagainst his shoulder, looked out across the cloud-filled valley in deep\r\ncontent and security.\r\n\r\nBut it was Georgina crying, all by herself, down the hillside, among the\r\nstones of the water-course where the washermen wash the clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNABOTH\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was how it happened; and the truth is also an allegory of Empire.\r\n\r\nI met him at the corner of my garden, an empty basket on his head, and\r\nan unclean cloth round his loins. That was all the property to which\r\nNaboth had the shadow of a claim when I first saw him. He opened our\r\nacquaintance by begging. He was very thin and showed nearly as many ribs\r\nas his basket; and he told me a long story about fever and a lawsuit,\r\nand an iron cauldron that had been seized by the court in execution of\r\na decree. I put my hand into my pocket to help Naboth, as kings of the\r\nEast have helped alien adventurers to the loss of their kingdoms. A\r\nrupee had hidden in my waistcoat lining. I never knew it was there, and\r\ngave the trove to Naboth as a direct gift from Heaven. He replied that I\r\nwas the only legitimate Protector of the Poor he had ever known.\r\n\r\nNext morning he reappeared, a little fatter in the round, and curled\r\nhimself into knots in the front verandah. He said I was his father and\r\nhis mother, and the direct descendant of all the gods in his Pantheon,\r\nbesides controlling the destinies of the universe. He himself was but a\r\nsweetmeat-seller, and much less important than the dirt under my feet.\r\nI had heard this sort of thing before, so I asked him what he wanted. My\r\nrupee, quoth Naboth, had raised him to the ever-lasting heavens, and\r\nhe wished to prefer a request. He wished to establish a sweetmeat-pitch\r\nnear the house of his benefactor, to gaze on my revered countenance as\r\nI went to and fro illumining the world. I was graciously pleased to give\r\npermission, and he went away with his head between his knees.\r\n\r\nNow at the far end of my garden, the ground slopes toward the public\r\nroad, and the slope is crowned with a thick shrubbery. There is a short\r\ncarriage-road from the house to the Mall, which passes close to the\r\nshrubbery. Next afternoon I saw that Naboth had seated himself at the\r\nbottom of the slope, down in the dust of the public road, and in the\r\nfull glare of the sun, with a starved basket of greasy sweets in\r\nfront of him. He had gone into trade once more on the strength of my\r\nmunificent donation, and the ground was as Paradise by my honoured\r\nfavour. Remember, there was only Naboth, his basket, the sunshine, and\r\nthe gray dust when the sap of my Empire first began.\r\n\r\nNext day he had moved himself up the slope nearer to my shrubbery, and\r\nwaved a palm-leaf fan to keep the flies off the sweets. So I judged that\r\nhe must have done a fair trade.\r\n\r\nFour days later I noticed that he had backed himself and his basket\r\nunder the shadow of the shrubbery, and had tied an Isabella-coloured rag\r\nbetween two branches in order to make more shade. There were plenty of\r\nsweets in his basket. I thought that trade must certainly be looking up.\r\n\r\nSeven weeks later the Government took up a plot of ground for a Chief\r\nCourt close to the end of my compound, and employed nearly four hundred\r\ncoolies on the foundations. Naboth bought a blue and white striped\r\nblanket, a brass lamp-stand, and a small boy, to cope with the rush of\r\ntrade, which was tremendous.\r\n\r\nFive days later he bought a huge, fat, red-backed account-book, and a\r\nglass inkstand. Thus I saw that the coolies had been getting into his\r\ndebt, and that commerce was increasing on legitimate lines of credit.\r\nAlso I saw that the one basket had grown into three, and that Naboth\r\nhad backed and hacked into the shrubbery, and made himself a nice little\r\nclearing for the proper display of the basket, the blanket, the books,\r\nand the boy.\r\n\r\nOne week and five days later he had built a mud fire-place in the\r\nclearing, and the fat account-book was overflowing. He said that God\r\ncreated few Englishmen of my kind, and that I was the incarnation of\r\nall human virtues. He offered me some of his sweets as tribute, and by\r\naccepting these I acknowledged him as my feudatory under the skirt of my\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later I noticed that the boy was in the habit of cooking\r\nNaboth’s mid-day meal for him, and Naboth was beginning to grow a\r\nstomach. He had hacked away more of my shrubbery and owned another and a\r\nfatter account-book.\r\n\r\nEleven weeks later Naboth had eaten his way nearly through that\r\nshrubbery, and there was a reed hut with a bedstead outside it, standing\r\nin the little glade that he had eroded. Two dogs and a baby slept on the\r\nbedstead. So I fancied Naboth had taken a wife. He said that he had,\r\nby my favour, done this thing, and that I was several times finer than\r\nKrishna. Six weeks and two days later a mud wall had grown up at the\r\nback of the hut. There were fowls in front and it smelt a little. The\r\nMunicipal Secretary said that a cess-pool was forming in the public road\r\nfrom the drainage of my compound, and that I must take steps to clear\r\nit away. I spoke to Naboth. He said I was Lord Paramount of his earthly\r\nconcerns, and the garden was all my own property, and sent me some more\r\nsweets in a second-hand duster.\r\n\r\nTwo months later a coolie bricklayer was killed in a scuffle that took\r\nplace opposite Naboth’s Vineyard. The Inspector of Police said it was\r\na serious case; went into my servants’ quarters; insulted my butler’s\r\nwife, and wanted to arrest my butler. The curious thing about the murder\r\nwas that most of the coolies were drunk at the time. Naboth pointed out\r\nthat my name was a strong shield between him and his enemies, and he\r\nexpected that another baby would be born to him shortly.\r\n\r\nFour months later the hut was ALL mud walls, very solidly built, and\r\nNaboth had used most of my shrubbery for his five goats. A silver watch\r\nand an aluminium chain shone upon his very round stomach. My servants\r\nwere alarmingly drunk several times, and used to waste the day with\r\nNaboth when they got the chance. I spoke to Naboth. He said, by my\r\nfavour and the glory of my countenance, he would make all his women-folk\r\nladies, and that if any one hinted that he was running an illicit\r\nstill under the shadow of the tamarisks, why, I, his Suzerain, was to\r\nprosecute.\r\n\r\nA week later he hired a man to make several dozen square yards of\r\ntrellis-work to put around the back of his hut, that his women-folk\r\nmight be screened from the public gaze. The man went away in the\r\nevening, and left his day’s work to pave the short cut from the public\r\nroad to my house. I was driving home in the dusk, and turned the corner\r\nby Naboth’s Vineyard quickly. The next thing I knew was that the horses\r\nof the phaeton were stamping and plunging in the strongest sort of\r\nbamboo net-work. Both beasts came down. One rose with nothing more than\r\nchipped knees. The other was so badly kicked that I was forced to shoot\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNaboth is gone now, and his hut is ploughed into its native mud with\r\nsweetmeats instead of salt for a sign that the place is accursed. I have\r\nbuilt a summer-house to overlook the end of the garden, and it is as a\r\nfort on my frontier whence I guard my Empire.\r\n\r\nI know exactly how Ahab felt. He has been shamefully misrepresented in\r\nthe Scriptures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM OF DUNCAN PARRENNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN\r\n& Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Mr. Bunyan of old, I, Duncan Parrenness, Writer to the Most\r\nHonourable the East India Company, in this God-forgotten city of\r\nCalcutta, have dreamed a dream, and never since that Kitty my mare fell\r\nlame have I been so troubled. Therefore, lest I should forget my dream,\r\nI have made shift to set it down here. Though Heaven knows how unhandy\r\nthe pen is to me who was always readier with sword than ink-horn when I\r\nleft London two long years since.\r\n\r\nWhen the Governor-General’s great dance (that he gives yearly at the\r\nlatter end of November) was finisht, I had gone to mine own room which\r\nlooks over that sullen, un-English stream, the Hoogly, scarce so sober\r\nas I might have been. Now, roaring drunk in the West is but fuddled in\r\nthe East, and I was drunk Nor’-Nor’ Easterly as Mr. Shakespeare might\r\nhave said. Yet, in spite of my liquor, the cool night winds (though I\r\nhave heard that they breed chills and fluxes innumerable) sobered me\r\nsomewhat; and I remembered that I had been but a little wrung and wasted\r\nby all the sicknesses of the past four months, whereas those young\r\nbloods that came eastward with me in the same ship had been all, a month\r\nback, planted to Eternity in the foul soil north of Writers’ Buildings.\r\nSo then, I thanked God mistily (though, to my shame, I never kneeled\r\ndown to do so) for license to live, at least till March should be upon\r\nus again.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we that were alive (and our number was less by far than those\r\nwho had gone to their last account in the hot weather late past) had\r\nmade very merry that evening, by the ramparts of the Fort, over this\r\nkindness of Providence; though our jests were neither witty nor such as\r\nI should have liked my Mother to hear.\r\n\r\nWhen I had lain down (or rather thrown me on my bed) and the fumes of my\r\ndrink had a little cleared away, I found that I could get no sleep for\r\nthinking of a thousand things that were better left alone. First, and\r\nit was a long time since I had thought of her, the sweet face of Kitty\r\nSomerset, drifted, as it might have been drawn in a picture, across the\r\nfoot of my bed, so plainly, that I almost thought she had been present\r\nin the body. Then I remembered how she drove me to this accursed country\r\nto get rich, that I might the more quickly marry her, our parents on\r\nboth sides giving their consent; and then how she thought better (or\r\nworse may be) of her troth, and wed Tom Sanderson but a short\r\nthree months after I had sailed. From Kitty I fell a-musing on Mrs.\r\nVansuythen, a tall pale woman with violet eyes that had come to Calcutta\r\nfrom the Dutch Factory at Chinsura, and had set all our young men, and\r\nnot a few of the factors, by the ears. Some of our ladies, it is true,\r\nsaid that she had never a husband or marriage-lines at all; but women,\r\nand specially those who have led only indifferent good lives themselves,\r\nare cruel hard one on another. Besides, Mrs. Vansuythen was far\r\nprettier than them all. She had been most gracious to me at the\r\nGovernor-General’s rout, and indeed I was looked upon by all as her\r\npreux chevalier--which is French for a much worse word. Now, whether\r\nI cared so much as the scratch of a pin for this same Mrs. Vansuythen\r\n(albeit I had vowed eternal love three days after we met) I knew not\r\nthen nor did till later on; but mine own pride, and a skill in the small\r\nsword that no man in Calcutta could equal, kept me in her affections. So\r\nthat I believed I worshipt her.\r\n\r\nWhen I had dismist her violet eyes from my thoughts, my reason reproacht\r\nme for ever having followed her at all; and I saw how the one year that\r\nI had lived in this land had so burnt and seared my mind with the flames\r\nof a thousand bad passions and desires, that I had aged ten months for\r\neach one in the Devil’s school. Whereat I thought of my Mother for a\r\nwhile, and was very penitent: making in my sinful tipsy mood a thousand\r\nvows of reformation--all since broken, I fear me, again and again.\r\nTo-morrow, says I to myself, I will live cleanly for ever. And I smiled\r\ndizzily (the liquor being still strong in me) to think of the dangers\r\nI had escaped; and built all manner of fine Castles in Spain, whereof\r\na shadowy Kitty Somerset that had the violet eyes and the sweet slow\r\nspeech of Mrs. Vansuythen, was always Queen.\r\n\r\nLastly, a very fine and magnificent courage (that doubtless had its\r\nbirth in Mr. Hastings’ Madeira) grew upon me, till it seemed that I\r\ncould become Governor-General, Nawab, Prince, ay, even the Great Mogul\r\nhimself, by the mere wishing of it. Wherefore, taking my first steps,\r\nrandom and unstable enough, towards my new kingdom, I kickt my servants\r\nsleeping without till they howled and ran from me, and called Heaven and\r\nEarth to witness that I, Duncan Parrenness, was a Writer in the service\r\nof the Company and afraid of no man. Then, seeing that neither the Moon\r\nnor the Great Bear were minded to accept my challenge, I lay down again\r\nand must have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nI was waked presently by my last words repeated two or three times, and\r\nI saw that there had come into the room a drunken man, as I thought,\r\nfrom Mr. Hastings’ rout. He sate down at the foot of my bed in all the\r\nworld as it belonged to him, and I took note, as well as I could, that\r\nhis face was somewhat like mine own grown older, save when it changed\r\nto the face of the Governor-General or my father, dead these six months.\r\nBut this seemed to me only natural, and the due result of too much wine;\r\nand I was so angered at his entry all unannounced, that I told him, not\r\nover civilly, to go. To all my words he made no answer whatever, only\r\nsaying slowly, as though it were some sweet morsel: ‘Writer in the\r\nCompany’s service and afraid of no man.’ Then he stops short, and\r\nturning round sharp upon me, says that one of my kidney need fear\r\nneither man nor devil; that I was a brave young man, and like enough,\r\nshould I live so long, to be Governor-General. But for all these things\r\n(and I suppose that he meant thereby the changes and chances of our\r\nshifty life in these parts) I must pay my price. By this time I had\r\nsobered somewhat, and being well waked out of my first sleep, was\r\ndisposed to look upon the matter as a tipsy man’s jest. So, says I\r\nmerrily: ‘And what price shall I pay for this palace of mine, which is\r\nbut twelve feet square, and my five poor pagodas a month? The Devil take\r\nyou and your jesting: I have paid my price twice over in sickness.’ At\r\nthat moment my man turns full towards me: so that by the moonlight I\r\ncould see every line and wrinkle of his face. Then my drunken mirth died\r\nout of me, as I have seen the waters of our great rivers die away in\r\none night; and I, Duncan Parrenness, who was afraid of no man, was taken\r\nwith a more deadly terror than I hold it has ever been the lot of mortal\r\nman to know. For I saw that his face was my very own, but marked and\r\nlined and scarred with the furrows of disease and much evil living--as\r\nI once, when I was (Lord help me) very drunk indeed, have seen mine own\r\nface, all white and drawn and grown old, in a mirror. I take it that any\r\nman would have been even more greatly feared than I. For I am in no way\r\nwanting in courage.\r\n\r\nAfter I had lain still for a little, sweating in my agony and waiting\r\nuntil I should awake from this terrible dream (for dream I knew it to\r\nbe) he says again, that I must pay my price, and a little after, as\r\nthough it were to be given in pagodas and sicca rupees: ‘What price will\r\nyou pay?’ Says I, very softly: ‘For God’s sake let me be, whoever you\r\nare, and I will mend my ways from to-night.’ Says he, laughing a little\r\nat my words, but otherwise making no motion of having heard them: ‘Nay,\r\nI would only rid so brave a young ruffler as yourself of much that will\r\nbe a great hindrance to you on your way through life in the Indies;\r\nfor believe me,’ and here he looks full on me once more, ‘there is no\r\nreturn.’ At all this rigmarole, which I could not then understand, I was\r\na good deal put aback and waited for what should come next. Says he very\r\ncalmly, ‘Give me your trust in man.’ At that I saw how heavy would be\r\nmy price, for I never doubted but that he could take from me all that\r\nhe asked, and my head was, through terror and wakefulness, altogether\r\ncleared of the wine I had drunk. So I takes him up very short, crying\r\nthat I was not so wholly bad as he would make believe, and that I\r\ntrusted my fellows to the full as much as they were worthy of it. ‘It\r\nwas none of my fault,’ says I, ‘if one half of them were liars and the\r\nother half deserved to be burnt in the hand, and I would once more ask\r\nhim to have done with his questions.’ Then I stopped, a little afraid,\r\nit is true, to have let my tongue so run away with me, but he took no\r\nnotice of this, and only laid his hand lightly on my left breast and I\r\nfelt very cold there for a while. Then he says, laughing more: ‘Give me\r\nyour faith in women.’ At that I started in my bed as though I had been\r\nstung, for I thought of my sweet mother in England, and for a while\r\nfancied that my faith in God’s best creatures could neither be shaken\r\nnor stolen from me. But later, Myself’s hard eyes being upon me, I fell\r\nto thinking, for the second time that night, of Kitty (she that jilted\r\nme and married Tom Sanderson) and of Mistress Vansuythen, whom only my\r\ndevilish pride made me follow, and how she was even worse than Kitty,\r\nand I worst of them all--seeing that with my life’s work to be done,\r\nI must needs go dancing down the Devil’s swept and garnished causeway,\r\nbecause, forsooth, there was a light woman’s smile at the end of it. And\r\nI thought that all women in the world were either like Kitty or Mistress\r\nVansuythen (as indeed they have ever since been to me) and this put me\r\nto such an extremity of rage and sorrow, that I was beyond word glad\r\nwhen Myself’s hand fell again on my left breast, and I was no more\r\ntroubled by these follies.\r\n\r\nAfter this he was silent for a little, and I made sure that he must go\r\nor I awake ere long: but presently he speaks again (and very softly)\r\nthat I was a fool to care for such follies as those he had taken from\r\nme, and that ere he went he would only ask me for a few other trifles\r\nsuch as no man, or for matter of that boy either, would keep about him\r\nin this country. And so it happened that he took from out of my very\r\nheart as it were, looking all the time into my face with my own eyes, as\r\nmuch as remained to me of my boy’s soul and conscience. This was to me\r\na far more terrible loss than the two that I had suffered before. For\r\nthough, Lord help me, I had travelled far enough from all paths of\r\ndecent or godly living, yet there was in me, though I myself write it, a\r\ncertain goodness of heart which, when I was sober (or sick) made me very\r\nsorry of all that I had done before the fit came on me. And this I lost\r\nwholly: having in place thereof another deadly coldness at the heart. I\r\nam not, as I have before said, ready with my pen, so I fear that what\r\nI have just written may not be readily understood. Yet there be certain\r\ntimes in a young man’s life, when, through great sorrow or sin, all the\r\nboy in him is burnt and seared away so that he passes at one step to the\r\nmore sorrowful state of manhood: as our staring Indian day changes\r\ninto night with never so much as the gray of twilight to temper the\r\ntwo extremes. This shall perhaps make my state more clear, if it be\r\nremembered that my torment was ten times as great as comes in the\r\nnatural course of nature to any man. At that time I dared not think of\r\nthe change that had come over me, and all in one night: though I have\r\noften thought of it since. ‘I have paid the price,’ says I, my teeth\r\nchattering, for I was deadly cold, ‘and what is my return?’ At this time\r\nit was nearly dawn, and Myself had begun to grow pale and thin against\r\nthe white light in the east, as my mother used to tell me is the custom\r\nof ghosts and devils and the like. He made as if he would go, but my\r\nwords stopt him and he laughed--as I remember that I laughed when I ran\r\nAngus Macalister through the sword-arm last August, because he said that\r\nMrs. Vansuythen was no better than she should be. ‘What return?’--says\r\nhe, catching up my last words--‘Why, strength to live as long as God or\r\nthe Devil pleases, and so long as you live my young master, my gift.’\r\nWith that he puts something into my hand, though it was still too dark\r\nto see what it was, and when next I lookt up he was gone.\r\n\r\nWhen the light came I made shift to behold his gift, and saw that it was\r\na little piece of dry bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCARNATION OF KRISHNA MULVANEY\r\n\r\n\r\n Wohl auf, my bully cavaliers,\r\n   We ride to church to-day,\r\n The man that hasn’t got a horse\r\n   Must steal one straight away.\r\n\r\n Be reverent, men, remember\r\n   This is a Gottes haus.\r\n Du, Conrad, cut along der aisle\r\n   And schenck der whiskey aus.\r\n                  HANS BREITMANN’S RIDE TO CHURCH.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, very far from England, there lived three men who loved\r\neach other so greatly that neither man nor woman could come between\r\nthem. They were in no sense refined, nor to be admitted to the\r\nouter-door mats of decent folk, because they happened to be private\r\nsoldiers in Her Majesty’s Army; and private soldiers of our service have\r\nsmall time for self-culture. Their duty is to keep themselves and their\r\naccoutrements specklessly clean, to refrain from getting drunk more\r\noften than is necessary, to obey their superiors, and to pray for a war.\r\nAll these things my friends accomplished; and of their own motion threw\r\nin some fighting-work for which the Army Regulations did not call. Their\r\nfate sent them to serve in India, which is not a golden country, though\r\npoets have sung otherwise. There men die with great swiftness, and those\r\nwho live suffer many and curious things. I do not think that my friends\r\nconcerned themselves much with the social or political aspects of the\r\nEast. They attended a not unimportant war on the northern frontier,\r\nanother one on our western boundary, and a third in Upper Burma. Then\r\ntheir regiment sat still to recruit, and the boundless monotony of\r\ncantonment life was their portion. They were drilled morning and evening\r\non the same dusty parade-ground. They wandered up and down the same\r\nstretch of dusty white road, attended the same church and the same\r\ngrog-shop, and slept in the same lime-washed barn of a barrack for two\r\nlong years. There was Mulvaney, the father in the craft, who had served\r\nwith various regiments from Bermuda to Halifax, old in war, scarred,\r\nreckless, resourceful, and in his pious hours an unequalled soldier.\r\nTo him turned for help and comfort six and a half feet of slow-moving,\r\nheavy-footed Yorkshireman, born on the wolds, bred in the dales,\r\nand educated chiefly among the carriers’ carts at the back of York\r\nrailway-station. His name was Learoyd, and his chief virtue an\r\nunmitigated patience which helped him to win fights. How Ortheris, a\r\nfox-terrier of a Cockney, ever came to be one of the trio, is a mystery\r\nwhich even to-day I cannot explain. ‘There was always three av us,’\r\nMulvaney used to say. ‘An’ by the grace av God, so long as our service\r\nlasts, three av us they’ll always be. ‘Tis betther so.’\r\n\r\nThey desired no companionship beyond their own, and it was evil for any\r\nman of the regiment who attempted dispute with them. Physical argument\r\nwas out of the question as regarded Mulvaney and the Yorkshireman; and\r\nassault on Ortheris meant a combined attack from these twain--a business\r\nwhich no five men were anxious to have on their hands. Therefore they\r\nflourished, sharing their drinks, their tobacco, and their money; good\r\nluck and evil; battle and the chances of death; life and the chances of\r\nhappiness from Calicut in southern, to Peshawur in northern India.\r\n\r\nThrough no merit of my own it was my good fortune to be in a measure\r\nadmitted to their friendship--frankly by Mulvaney from the beginning,\r\nsullenly and with reluctance by Learoyd, and suspiciously by Ortheris,\r\nwho held to it that no man not in the Army could fraternise with a\r\nred-coat. ‘Like to like,’ said he. ‘I’m a bloomin’ sodger--he’s a\r\nbloomin’ civilian. ‘Tain’t natural--that’s all.’\r\n\r\nBut that was not all. They thawed progressively, and in the thawing told\r\nme more of their lives and adventures than I am ever likely to write.\r\n\r\nOmitting all else, this tale begins with the Lamentable Thirst that was\r\nat the beginning of First Causes. Never was such a thirst--Mulvaney told\r\nme so. They kicked against their compulsory virtue, but the attempt was\r\nonly successful in the case of Ortheris. He, whose talents were\r\nmany, went forth into the highways and stole a dog from a\r\n‘civilian’--videlicet, some one, he knew not who, not in the Army. Now\r\nthat civilian was but newly connected by marriage with the colonel of\r\nthe regiment, and outcry was made from quarters least anticipated by\r\nOrtheris, and, in the end, he was forced, lest a worse thing should\r\nhappen, to dispose at ridiculously unremunerative rates of as promising\r\na small terrier as ever graced one end of a leading string. The\r\npurchase-money was barely sufficient for one small outbreak which led\r\nhim to the guard-room. He escaped, however, with nothing worse than a\r\nsevere reprimand, and a few hours of punishment drill. Not for nothing\r\nhad he acquired the reputation of being ‘the best soldier of his inches’\r\nin the regiment. Mulvaney had taught personal cleanliness and efficiency\r\nas the first articles of his companions’ creed. ‘A dhirty man,’ he was\r\nused to say, in the speech of his kind, ‘goes to Clink for a weakness\r\nin the knees, an’ is coort-martialled for a pair av socks missin’; but\r\na clane man, such as is an ornament to his service--a man whose buttons\r\nare gold, whose coat is wax upon him, an’ whose ‘coutrements are widout\r\na speck--THAT man may, spakin’ in reason, do fwhat he likes an’ dhrink\r\nfrom day to divil. That’s the pride av bein’ dacint.’\r\n\r\nWe sat together, upon a day, in the shade of a ravine far from the\r\nbarracks, where a watercourse used to run in rainy weather. Behind us\r\nwas the scrub jungle, in which jackals, peacocks, the gray wolves of the\r\nNorth-Western Provinces, and occasionally a tiger estrayed from Central\r\nIndia, were supposed to dwell. In front lay the cantonment, glaring\r\nwhite under a glaring sun; and on either side ran the broad road that\r\nled to Delhi.\r\n\r\nIt was the scrub that suggested to my mind the wisdom of Mulvaney taking\r\na day’s leave and going upon a shooting-tour. The peacock is a holy bird\r\nthroughout India, and he who slays one is in danger of being mobbed by\r\nthe nearest villagers; but on the last occasion that Mulvaney had gone\r\nforth, he had contrived, without in the least offending local religious\r\nsusceptibilities, to return with six beautiful peacock skins which he\r\nsold to profit. It seemed just possible then--\r\n\r\n‘But fwhat manner av use is ut to me goin’ out widout a dhrink? The\r\nground’s powdher-dhry underfoot, an’ ut gets unto the throat fit to\r\nkill,’ wailed Mulvaney, looking at me reproachfully. ‘An’ a peacock is\r\nnot a bird you can catch the tail av onless ye run. Can a man run on\r\nwather--an’ jungle-wather too?’\r\n\r\nOrtheris had considered the question in all its bearings. He spoke,\r\nchewing his pipe-stem meditatively the while:\r\n\r\n‘Go forth, return in glory, To Clusium’s royal ‘ome:\r\n An’ round these bloomin’ temples ‘ang\r\n The bloomin’ shields o’ Rome.\r\n\r\nYou better go. You ain’t like to shoot yourself--not while there’s a\r\nchanst of liquor. Me an’ Learoyd’ll stay at ‘ome an’ keep shop--‘case\r\no’ anythin’ turnin’ up. But you go out with a gas-pipe gun an’ ketch\r\nthe little peacockses or somethin’. You kin get one day’s leave easy as\r\nwinkin’. Go along an’ get it, an’ get peacockses or somethin’.’\r\n\r\n‘Jock,’ said Mulvaney, turning to Learoyd, who was half asleep under the\r\nshadow of the bank. He roused slowly.\r\n\r\n‘Sitha, Mulvaaney, go,’ said he.\r\n\r\nAnd Mulvaney went; cursing his allies with Irish fluency and\r\nbarrack-room point.\r\n\r\n‘Take note,’ said he, when he had won his holiday, and appeared dressed\r\nin his roughest clothes with the only other regimental fowling-piece in\r\nhis hand. ‘Take note, Jock, an’ you Orth’ris, I am goin’ in the face\r\nav my own will--all for to please you. I misdoubt anythin’ will come av\r\npermiscuous huntin’ afther peacockses in a desolit lan’; an’ I know that\r\nI will lie down an’ die wid thirrrst. Me catch peacockses for you, ye\r\nlazy scutts--an’ be sacrificed by the peasanthry--Ugh!’\r\n\r\nHe waved a huge paw and went away.\r\n\r\nAt twilight, long before the appointed hour, he returned empty-handed,\r\nmuch begrimed with dirt.\r\n\r\n‘Peacockses?’ queried Ortheris from the safe rest of a barrack-room\r\ntable whereon he was smoking cross-legged, Learoyd fast asleep on a\r\nbench.\r\n\r\n‘Jock,’ said Mulvaney without answering, as he stirred up the sleeper.\r\n‘Jock, can ye fight? Will ye fight?’\r\n\r\nVery slowly the meaning of the words communicated itself to the\r\nhalf-roused man. He understood--and again--what might these things mean?\r\nMulvaney was shaking him savagely. Meantime the men in the room howled\r\nwith delight. There was war in the confederacy at last--war and the\r\nbreaking of bonds.\r\n\r\nBarrack-room etiquette is stringent. On the direct challenge must\r\nfollow the direct reply. This is more binding than the ties of tried\r\nfriendship. Once again Mulvaney repeated the question. Learoyd answered\r\nby the only means in his power, and so swiftly that the Irishman had\r\nbarely time to avoid the blow. The laughter around increased. Learoyd\r\nlooked bewilderedly at his friend--himself as greatly bewildered.\r\nOrtheris dropped from the table because his world was falling.\r\n\r\n‘Come outside,’ said Mulvaney, and as the occupants of the barrack-room\r\nprepared joyously to follow, he turned and said furiously, ‘There will\r\nbe no fight this night--onless any wan av you is wishful to assist. The\r\nman that does, follows on.’\r\n\r\nNo man moved. The three passed out into the moonlight, Learoyd fumbling\r\nwith the buttons of his coat. The parade-ground was deserted except for\r\nthe scurrying jackals. Mulvaney’s impetuous rush carried his companions\r\nfar into the open ere Learoyd attempted to turn round and continue the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n‘Be still now. ‘Twas my fault for beginnin’ things in the middle av an\r\nend, Jock. I should ha’ comminst wid an explanation; but Jock, dear,\r\non your sowl are ye fit, think you, for the finest fight that iver\r\nwas--betther than fightin’ me? Considher before ye answer.’\r\n\r\nMore than ever puzzled, Learoyd turned round two or three times, felt an\r\narm, kicked tentatively, and answered, ‘Ah’m fit.’ He was accustomed to\r\nfight blindly at the bidding of the superior mind.\r\n\r\nThey sat them down, the men looking on from afar, and Mulvaney untangled\r\nhimself in mighty words.\r\n\r\n‘Followin’ your fools’ scheme I wint out into the thrackless desert\r\nbeyond the barricks. An’ there I met a pious Hindu dhriving a\r\nbullock-kyart. I tuk ut for granted he wud be delighted for to convoy me\r\na piece, an’ I jumped in--’\r\n\r\n‘You long, lazy, black-haired swine,’ drawled Ortheris, who would have\r\ndone the same thing under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n‘’Twas the height av policy. That naygur-man dhruv miles an’ miles--as\r\nfar as the new railway line they’re buildin’ now back av the Tavi river.\r\n“‘Tis a kyart for dhirt only,” says he now an’ again timoreously, to\r\nget me out av ut. “Dhirt I am,” sez I, “an’ the dhryest that you iver\r\nkyarted. Dhrive on, me son, an glory be wid you.” At that I wint to\r\nslape, an’ took no heed till he pulled up on the embankmint av the line\r\nwhere the coolies were pilin’ mud. There was a matther av two thousand\r\ncoolies on that line--you remimber that. Prisintly a bell rang, an’ they\r\nthroops off to a big pay-shed. “Where’s the white man in charge?” sez I\r\nto my kyart-dhriver. “In the shed,” sez he, “engaged on a riffle.”--“A\r\nfwhat?” sez I. “Riffle,” sez he. “You take ticket. He take money. You\r\nget nothin’.”--\r\n\r\n“Oho!” sez I, “that’s fwhat the shuperior an’ cultivated man calls\r\na raffle, me misbeguided child av darkness an’ sin. Lead on to that\r\nraffle, though fwhat the mischief ‘tis doin’ so far away from uts\r\nhome--which is the charity-bazaar at Christmas, an’ the colonel’s wife\r\ngrinnin’ behind the tea-table--is more than I know.” Wid that I wint to\r\nthe shed an’ found ‘twas pay-day among the coolies. Their wages was on a\r\ntable forninst a big, fine, red buck av a man--sivun fut high, four fut\r\nwide, an’ three fut thick, wid a fist on him like a corn-sack. He was\r\npayin’ the coolies fair an’ easy, but he wud ask each man if he wud\r\nraffle that month, an’ each man sez? “Yes,” av course. Thin he wud\r\ndeduct from their wages accordin’. Whin all was paid, he filled an ould\r\ncigar-box full av gun-wads an’ scatthered ut among the coolies. They did\r\nnot take much joy av that performince, an’ small wondher. A man close to\r\nme picks up a black gun-wad an’ sings out, “I have ut.”--“Good may ut\r\ndo you,” sez I. The coolie wint forward to this big, fine, red man, who\r\nthrew a cloth off av the most sumpshus, jooled, enamelled an’ variously\r\nbedivilled sedan-chair I iver saw.’\r\n\r\n‘Sedan-chair! Put your ‘ead in a bag. That was a palanquin. Don’t yer\r\nknow a palanquin when you see it?’ said Ortheris with great scorn.\r\n\r\n‘I chuse to call ut sedan-chair, an’ chair ut shall be, little man,’\r\ncontinued the Irishman. ‘’Twas a most amazin’ chair--all lined wid pink\r\nsilk an’ fitted wid red silk curtains. “Here ut is,” sez the red man.\r\n“Here ut is,” sez the coolie, an’ he grinned weakly-ways. “Is ut any\r\nuse to you?” sez the red man. “No,” sez the coolie; “I’d like to make a\r\npresint av ut to you.”--“I am graciously pleased to accept that same,”\r\n sez the red man; an’ at that all the coolies cried aloud in fwhat was\r\nmint for cheerful notes, an’ wint back to their diggin’, lavin’ me alone\r\nin the shed. The red man saw me, an’ his face grew blue on his big, fat\r\nneck. “Fwhat d’you want here?” sez he. “Standin’-room an’ no more,” sez\r\nI, “onless it may be fwhat ye niver had, an’ that’s manners, ye rafflin’\r\nruffian,” for I was not goin’ to have the Service throd upon. “Out of\r\nthis,” sez he. “I’m in charge av this section av construction.”--“I’m\r\nin charge av mesilf,” sez I, “an’ it’s like I will stay a while. D’ye\r\nraffle much in these parts?”--“Fwhat’s that to you?” sez he. “Nothin’,”\r\n sez I, “but a great dale to you, for begad I’m thinkin’ you get the full\r\nhalf av your revenue from that sedan-chair. Is ut always raffled so?” I\r\nsez, an’ wid that I wint to a coolie to ask questions. Bhoys, that man’s\r\nname is Dearsley, an’ he’s been rafflin’ that ould sedan-chair monthly\r\nthis matther av nine months. Ivry coolie on the section takes a\r\nticket--or he gives ‘em the go--wanst a month on pay-day. Ivry coolie\r\nthat wins ut gives ut back to him, for ‘tis too big to carry away, an’\r\nhe’d sack the man that thried to sell ut. That Dearsley has been makin’\r\nthe rowlin’ wealth av Roshus by nefarious rafflin’. Think av the burnin’\r\nshame to the sufferin’ coolie-man that the army in Injia are bound to\r\nprotect an’ nourish in their bosoms! Two thousand coolies defrauded\r\nwanst a month!’\r\n\r\n‘Dom t’ coolies. Has’t gotten t’ cheer, man?’ said Learoyd.\r\n\r\n‘Hould on. Havin’ onearthed this amazin’ an’ stupenjus fraud committed\r\nby the man Dearsley, I hild a council av war; he thryin’ all the time to\r\nsejuce me into a fight with opprobrious language. That sedan-chair niver\r\nbelonged by right to any foreman av coolies. ‘Tis a king’s chair or a\r\nquane’s. There’s gold on ut an’ silk an’ all manner av trapesemints.\r\nBhoys, ‘tis not for me to countenance any sort av wrong-doin’--me bein’\r\nthe ould man--but--anyway he has had ut nine months, an’ he dare not\r\nmake throuble av ut was taken from him. Five miles away, or ut may be\r\nsix--’\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, and the jackals howled merrily. Learoyd bared\r\none arm, and contemplated it in the moonlight. Then he nodded partly\r\nto himself and partly to his friends. Ortheris wriggled with suppressed\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n‘I thought ye wud see the reasonableness av ut,’ said Mulvaney. ‘I\r\nmade bould to say as much to the man before. He was for a direct front\r\nattack--fut, horse, an’ guns--an’ all for nothin’, seein’ that I had no\r\nthransport to convey the machine away. “I will not argue wid you,” sez\r\nI, “this day, but subsequently, Mister Dearsley, me rafflin’ jool, we\r\ntalk ut out lengthways. ‘Tis no good policy to swindle the naygur av his\r\nhard-earned emolumints, an’ by presint informashin’”--‘twas the kyart\r\nman that tould me--“ye’ve been perpethrating that same for nine months.\r\nBut I’m a just man,” sez I, “an’ overlookin’ the presumpshin that\r\nyondher settee wid the gilt top was not come by honust”--at that he\r\nturned sky-green, so I knew things was more thrue than tellable--“not\r\ncome by honust, I’m willin’ to compound the felony for this month’s\r\nwinnin’s.”’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! Ho!’ from Learoyd and Ortheris.\r\n\r\n‘That man Dearsley’s rushin’ on his fate,’ continued Mulvaney, solemnly\r\nwagging his head. ‘All Hell had no name bad enough for me that tide.\r\nFaith, he called me a robber! Me! that was savin’ him from continuin’\r\nin his evil ways widout a remonstrince--an’ to a man av conscience\r\na remonstrince may change the chune av his life. “‘Tis not for me to\r\nargue,” sez I, “fwhatever ye are, Mister Dearsley, but, by my hand, I’ll\r\ntake away the temptation for you that lies in that sedan-chair.”--“You\r\nwill have to fight me for ut,” sez he, “for well I know you will never\r\ndare make report to any one.”--“Fight I will,” sez I, “but not this day,\r\nfor I’m rejuced for want av nourishment.”--“Ye’re an ould bould hand,”\r\n sez he, sizin’ me up an’ down; “an’ a jool av a fight we will have.\r\nEat now an’ dhrink, an’ go your way.” Wid that he gave me some hump an’\r\nwhisky--good whisky--an’ we talked av this an’ that the while. “It goes\r\nhard on me now,” sez I, wipin’ my mouth, “to confiscate that piece av\r\nfurniture, but justice is justice.”--“Ye’ve not got ut yet,” sez he;\r\n“there’s the fight between.”--“There is,” sez I, “an’ a good fight. Ye\r\nshall have the pick av the best quality in my rigimint for the dinner\r\nyou have given this day.” Thin I came hot-foot to you two. Hould your\r\ntongue, the both. ‘Tis this way. To-morrow we three will go there an’ he\r\nshall have his pick betune me an’ Jock. Jock’s a deceivin’ fighter, for\r\nhe is all fat to the eye, an’ he moves slow. Now, I’m all beef to the\r\nlook, an’ I move quick. By my reckonin’ the Dearsley man won’t take me;\r\nso me an’ Orth’ris ‘ll see fair play. Jock, I tell you, ‘twill be big\r\nfightin’--whipped, wid the cream above the jam. Afther the business\r\n‘twill take a good three av us--Jock ‘ll be very hurt--to haul away that\r\nsedan-chair.’\r\n\r\n‘Palanquin.’ This from Ortheris.\r\n\r\n‘Fwhatever ut is, we must have ut. ‘Tis the only sellin’ piece av\r\nproperty widin reach that we can get so cheap. An’ fwhat’s a fight\r\nafther all? He has robbed the naygur-man, dishonust. We rob him honust\r\nfor the sake av the whisky he gave me.’\r\n\r\n‘But wot’ll we do with the bloomin’ article when we’ve got it? Them\r\npalanquins are as big as ‘ouses, an’ uncommon ‘ard to sell, as McCleary\r\nsaid when ye stole the sentry-box from the Curragh.’\r\n\r\n‘Who’s goin’ to do t’ fightin’?’ said Learoyd, and Ortheris subsided.\r\nThe three returned to barracks without a word. Mulvaney’s last argument\r\nclinched the matter. This palanquin was property, vendible, and to\r\nbe attained in the simplest and least embarrassing fashion. It would\r\neventually become beer. Great was Mulvaney.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon a procession of three formed itself and disappeared into\r\nthe scrub in the direction of the new railway line. Learoyd alone was\r\nwithout care, for Mulvaney dived darkly into the future, and little\r\nOrtheris feared the unknown. What befell at that interview in the lonely\r\npay-shed by the side of the half-built embankment, only a few hundred\r\ncoolies know, and their tale is confusing one, running thus--\r\n\r\n‘We were at work. Three men in red coats came. They saw the\r\nSahib--Dearsley Sahib. They made oration; and noticeably the small man\r\namong the red-coats. Dearsley Sahib also made oration, and used many\r\nvery strong words. Upon this talk they departed together to an open\r\nspace, and there the fat man in the red coat fought with Dearsley Sahib\r\nafter the custom of white men--with his hands, making no noise, and\r\nnever at all pulling Dearsley Sahib’s hair. Such of us as were not\r\nafraid beheld these things for just so long a time as a man needs to\r\ncook the mid-day meal. The small man in the red coat had possessed\r\nhimself of Dearsley Sahib’s watch. No, he did not steal that watch. He\r\nheld it in his hand, and at certain seasons made outcry, and the twain\r\nceased their combat, which was like the combat of young bulls in spring.\r\nBoth men were soon all red, but Dearsley Sahib was much more red than\r\nthe other. Seeing this, and fearing for his life--because we greatly\r\nloved him--some fifty of us made shift to rush upon the red-coats. But\r\na certain man--very black as to the hair, and in no way to be confused\r\nwith the small man, or the fat man who fought--that man, we affirm, ran\r\nupon us, and of us he embraced some ten or fifty in both arms, and beat\r\nour heads together, so that our livers turned to water, and we ran away.\r\nIt is not good to interfere in the fightings of white men. After that\r\nDearsley Sahib fell and did not rise, these men jumped upon his stomach\r\nand despoiled him of all his money, and attempted to fire the pay-shed,\r\nand departed. Is it true that Dearsley Sahib makes no complaint of these\r\nlatter things having been done? We were senseless with fear, and do not\r\nat all remember. There was no palanquin near the pay-shed. What do we\r\nknow about palanquins? Is it true that Dearsley Sahib does not return to\r\nthis place, on account of his sickness, for ten days? This is the fault\r\nof those bad men in the red coats, who should be severely punished; for\r\nDearsley Sahib is both our father and mother, and we love him much. Yet,\r\nif Dearsley Sahib does not return to this place at all, we will speak\r\nthe truth. There was a palanquin, for the up-keep of which we were\r\nforced to pay nine-tenths of our monthly wage. On such mulctings\r\nDearsley Sahib allowed us to make obeisance to him before the palanquin.\r\nWhat could we do? We were poor men. He took a full half of our wages.\r\nWill the Government repay us those moneys? Those three men in red coats\r\nbore the palanquin upon their shoulders and departed. All the money that\r\nDearsley Sahib had taken from us was in the cushions of that palanquin.\r\nTherefore they stole it. Thousands of rupees were there--all our money.\r\nIt was our bank-box, to fill which we cheerfully contributed to Dearsley\r\nSahib three-sevenths of our monthly wage. Why does the white man look\r\nupon us with the eye of disfavour? Before God, there was a palanquin,\r\nand now there is no palanquin; and if they send the police here to make\r\ninquisition, we can only say that there never has been any palanquin.\r\nWhy should a palanquin be near these works? We are poor men, and we know\r\nnothing.’\r\n\r\nSuch is the simplest version of the simplest story connected with the\r\ndescent upon Dearsley. From the lips of the coolies I received it.\r\nDearsley himself was in no condition to say anything, and Mulvaney\r\npreserved a massive silence, broken only by the occasional licking of\r\nthe lips. He had seen a fight so gorgeous that even his power of speech\r\nwas taken from him. I respected that reserve until, three days after the\r\naffair, I discovered in a disused stable in my quarters a palanquin of\r\nunchastened splendour--evidently in past days the litter of a queen. The\r\npole whereby it swung between the shoulders of the bearers was rich with\r\nthe painted papier-mache of Cashmere. The shoulder-pads were of yellow\r\nsilk. The panels of the litter itself were ablaze with the loves of\r\nall the gods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon--lacquer on cedar. The\r\ncedar sliding doors were fitted with hasps of translucent Jaipur enamel\r\nand ran in grooves shod with silver. The cushions were of brocaded Delhi\r\nsilk, and the curtains which once hid any glimpse of the beauty of the\r\nking’s palace were stiff with gold. Closer investigation showed that the\r\nentire fabric was everywhere rubbed and discoloured by time and wear;\r\nbut even thus it was sufficiently gorgeous to deserve housing on the\r\nthreshold of a royal zenana. I found no fault with it, except that\r\nit was in my stable. Then, trying to lift it by the silver-shod\r\nshoulder-pole, I laughed. The road from Dearsley’s pay-shed to the\r\ncantonment was a narrow and uneven one, and, traversed by three very\r\ninexperienced palanquin-bearers, one of whom was sorely battered about\r\nthe head, must have been a path of torment. Still I did not quite\r\nrecognise the right of the three musketeers to turn me into a ‘fence’\r\nfor stolen property.\r\n\r\n‘I’m askin’ you to warehouse ut,’ said Mulvaney when he was brought to\r\nconsider the question. ‘There’s no steal in ut. Dearsley tould us we cud\r\nhave ut if we fought. Jock fought--an’, oh, sorr, when the throuble\r\nwas at uts finest an’ Jock was bleedin’ like a stuck pig, an’ little\r\nOrth’ris was shquealin’ on one leg chewin’ big bites out av Dearsley’s\r\nwatch, I wud ha’ given my place at the fight to have had you see wan\r\nround. He tuk Jock, as I suspicioned he would, an’ Jock was deceptive.\r\nNine roun’s they were even matched, an’ at the tenth--About that\r\npalanquin now. There’s not the least throuble in the world, or we wud\r\nnot ha’ brought ut here. You will ondherstand that the Queen--God\r\nbless her!--does not reckon for a privit soldier to kape elephints an’\r\npalanquins an’ sich in barricks. Afther we had dhragged ut down from\r\nDearsley’s through that cruel scrub that near broke Orth’ris’s heart,\r\nwe set ut in the ravine for a night; an’ a thief av a porcupine an’ a\r\ncivet-cat av a jackal roosted in ut, as well we knew in the mornin’. I\r\nput ut to you, sorr, is an elegint palanquin, fit for the princess, the\r\nnatural abidin’ place av all the vermin in cantonmints? We brought ut\r\nto you, afther dhark, and put ut in your shtable. Do not let\r\nyour conscience prick. Think av the rejoicin’ men in the pay-shed\r\nyonder--lookin’ at Dearsley wid his head tied up in a towel--an’ well\r\nknowin’ that they can dhraw their pay ivry month widout stoppages for\r\nriffles. Indirectly, sorr, you have rescued from an onprincipled son av\r\na night-hawk the peasanthry av a numerous village. An’ besides, will I\r\nlet that sedan-chair rot on our hands? Not I. ‘Tis not every day a piece\r\nav pure joolry comes into the market. There’s not a king widin these\r\nforty miles’--he waved his hand round the dusty horizon--‘not a king wud\r\nnot be glad to buy ut. Some day meself, whin I have leisure, I’ll take\r\nut up along the road an’ dishpose av ut.’\r\n\r\n‘How?’ said I, for I knew the man was capable of anything.\r\n\r\n‘Get into ut, av coorse, and keep wan eye open through the curtains.\r\nWhin I see a likely man av the native persuasion, I will descind\r\nblushin’ from my canopy and say, “Buy a palanquin, ye black scutt?”\r\n I will have to hire four men to carry me first, though; and that’s\r\nimpossible till next pay-day.’\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Learoyd, who had fought for the prize, and in\r\nthe winning secured the highest pleasure life had to offer him, was\r\naltogether disposed to undervalue it, while Ortheris openly said it\r\nwould be better to break the thing up. Dearsley, he argued, might be a\r\nmany-sided man, capable, despite his magnificent fighting qualities, of\r\nsetting in motion the machinery of the civil law--a thing much abhorred\r\nby the soldier. Under any circumstances their fun had come and passed;\r\nthe next pay-day was close at hand, when there would be beer for all.\r\nWherefore longer conserve the painted palanquin?\r\n\r\n‘A first-class rifle-shot an’ a good little man av your inches you are,’\r\nsaid Mulvaney. ‘But you niver had a head worth a soft-boiled egg. ‘Tis\r\nme has to lie awake av nights schamin’ an’ plottin’ for the three av\r\nus. Orth’ris, me son, ‘tis no matther av a few gallons av beer--no, nor\r\ntwenty gallons--but tubs an’ vats an’ firkins in that sedan-chair. Who\r\nut was, an’ what ut was, an’ how ut got there, we do not know; but I\r\nknow in my bones that you an’ me an’ Jock wid his sprained thumb will\r\nget a fortune thereby. Lave me alone, an’ let me think.’\r\n\r\nMeantime the palanquin stayed in my stall, the key of which was in\r\nMulvaney’s hands.\r\n\r\nPay-day came, and with it beer. It was not in experience to hope that\r\nMulvaney, dried by four weeks’ drought, would avoid excess. Next morning\r\nhe and the palanquin had disappeared. He had taken the precaution of\r\ngetting three days’ leave ‘to see a friend on the railway,’ and the\r\ncolonel, well knowing that the seasonal outburst was near, and hoping it\r\nwould spend its force beyond the limits of his jurisdiction, cheerfully\r\ngave him all he demanded. At this point Mulvaney’s history, as recorded\r\nin the mess-room, stopped.\r\n\r\nOrtheris carried it not much further. ‘No, ‘e wasn’t drunk,’ said the\r\nlittle man loyally, ‘the liquor was no more than feelin’ its way round\r\ninside of ‘im; but ‘e went an’ filled that ‘ole bloomin’ palanquin with\r\nbottles ‘fore ‘e went off. ‘E’s gone an’ ‘ired six men to carry ‘im,\r\nan’ I ‘ad to ‘elp ‘im into ‘is nupshal couch, ‘cause ‘e wouldn’t\r\n‘ear reason. ‘E’s gone off in ‘is shirt an’ trousies, swearin’\r\ntremenjus--gone down the road in the palanquin, wavin’ ‘is legs out o’\r\nwindy.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said I, ‘but where?’\r\n\r\n‘Now you arx me a question. ‘E said ‘e was goin’ to sell that palanquin,\r\nbut from observations what happened when I was stuffin’ ‘im through the\r\ndoor, I fancy ‘e’s gone to the new embankment to mock at Dearsley. ‘Soon\r\nas Jock’s off duty I’m goin’ there to see if ‘e’s safe--not Mulvaney,\r\nbut t’other man. My saints, but I pity ‘im as ‘elps Terence out o’ the\r\npalanquin when ‘e’s once fair drunk!’\r\n\r\n‘He’ll come back without harm,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘’Corse ‘e will. On’y question is, what ‘ll ‘e be doin’ on the road?\r\nKilling Dearsley, like as not. ‘E shouldn’t ‘a gone without Jock or me.’\r\n\r\nReinforced by Learoyd, Ortheris sought the foreman of the coolie-gang.\r\nDearsley’s head was still embellished with towels. Mulvaney, drunk\r\nor sober, would have struck no man in that condition, and Dearsley\r\nindignantly denied that he would have taken advantage of the intoxicated\r\nbrave.\r\n\r\n‘I had my pick o’ you two,’ he explained to Learoyd, ‘and you got my\r\npalanquin--not before I’d made my profit on it. Why’d I do harm when\r\neverything’s settled? Your man DID come here--drunk as Davy’s sow on a\r\nfrosty night--came a-purpose to mock me--stuck his head out of the\r\ndoor an’ called me a crucified hodman. I made him drunker, an’ sent him\r\nalong. But I never touched him.’\r\n\r\nTo these things, Learoyd, slow to perceive the evidences of sincerity,\r\nanswered only, ‘If owt comes to Mulvaaney ‘long o’ you, I’ll gripple\r\nyou, clouts or no clouts on your ugly head, an’ I’ll draw t’ throat\r\ntwistyways, man. See there now.’\r\n\r\nThe embassy removed itself, and Dearsley, the battered, laughed alone\r\nover his supper that evening.\r\n\r\nThree days passed--a fourth and a fifth. The week drew to a close\r\nand Mulvaney did not return. He, his royal palanquin, and his six\r\nattendants, had vanished into air. A very large and very tipsy soldier,\r\nhis feet sticking out of the litter of a reigning princess, is not a\r\nthing to travel along the ways without comment. Yet no man of all the\r\ncountry round had seen any such wonder. He was, and he was not; and\r\nLearoyd suggested the immediate smashment of Dearsley as a sacrifice to\r\nhis ghost. Ortheris insisted that all was well, and in the light of past\r\nexperience his hopes seemed reasonable.\r\n\r\n‘When Mulvaney goes up the road,’ said he, ‘’e’s like to go a very long\r\nways up, specially when ‘e’s so blue drunk as ‘e is now. But what gits\r\nme is ‘is not bein’ ‘eard of pullin’ wool off the niggers somewheres\r\nabout. That don’t look good. The drink must ha’ died out in ‘im by this,\r\nunless ‘e’s broke a bank, an’ then--Why don’t ‘e come back? ‘E didn’t\r\nought to ha’ gone off without us.’\r\n\r\nEven Ortheris’s heart sank at the end of the seventh day, for half the\r\nregiment were out scouring the country-side, and Learoyd had been forced\r\nto fight two men who hinted openly that Mulvaney had deserted. To do him\r\njustice, the colonel laughed at the notion, even when it was put forward\r\nby his much-trusted adjutant.\r\n\r\n‘Mulvaney would as soon think of deserting as you would,’ said he. ‘No;\r\nhe’s either fallen into a mischief among the villagers--and yet that\r\nisn’t likely, for he’d blarney himself out of the Pit; or else he is\r\nengaged on urgent private affairs--some stupendous devilment that we\r\nshall hear of at mess after it has been the round of the barrack-rooms.\r\nThe worst of it is that I shall have to give him twenty-eight days’\r\nconfinement at least for being absent without leave, just when I most\r\nwant him to lick the new batch of recruits into shape. I never knew a\r\nman who could put a polish on young soldiers as quickly as Mulvaney can.\r\nHow does he do it?’\r\n\r\n‘With blarney and the buckle-end of a belt, sir,’ said the adjutant. ‘He\r\nis worth a couple of non-commissioned officers when we are dealing with\r\nan Irish draft, and the London lads seem to adore him. The worst of it\r\nis that if he goes to the cells the other two are neither to hold nor\r\nto bind till he comes out again. I believe Ortheris preaches mutiny on\r\nthose occasions, and I know that the mere presence of Learoyd mourning\r\nfor Mulvaney kills all the cheerfulness of his room. The sergeants tell\r\nme that he allows no man to laugh when he feels unhappy. They are a\r\nqueer gang.’\r\n\r\n‘For all that, I wish we had a few more of them. I like a well-conducted\r\nregiment, but these pasty-faced, shifty-eyed, mealy-mouthed young\r\nslouchers from the depot worry me sometimes with their offensive virtue.\r\nThey don’t seem to have backbone enough to do anything but play cards\r\nand prowl round the married quarters. I believe I’d forgive that old\r\nvillain on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that I\r\ncould in decency accept.’\r\n\r\n‘Not likely to be much difficulty about that, sir,’ said the adjutant.\r\n‘Mulvaney’s explanations are only one degree less wonderful than his\r\nperformances. They say that when he was in the Black Tyrone, before he\r\ncame to us, he was discovered on the banks of the Liffey trying to sell\r\nhis colonel’s charger to a Donegal dealer as a perfect lady’s hack.\r\nShackbolt commanded the Tyrone then.’\r\n\r\n‘Shackbolt must have had apoplexy at the thought of his ramping\r\nwar-horses answering to that description. He used to buy unbacked\r\ndevils, and tame them on some pet theory of starvation. What did\r\nMulvaney say?’\r\n\r\n‘That he was a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nAnimals, anxious to “sell the poor baste where he would get something\r\nto fill out his dimples.” Shackbolt laughed, but I fancy that was why\r\nMulvaney exchanged to ours.’\r\n\r\n‘I wish he were back,’ said the colonel; ‘for I like him and believe he\r\nlikes me.’\r\n\r\nThat evening, to cheer our souls, Learoyd, Ortheris, and I went into the\r\nwaste to smoke out a porcupine. All the dogs attended, but even their\r\nclamour--and they began to discuss the shortcomings of porcupines before\r\nthey left cantonments--could not take us out of ourselves. A large,\r\nlow moon turned the tops of the plume-grass to silver, and the stunted\r\ncamelthorn bushes and sour tamarisks into the likenesses of trooping\r\ndevils. The smell of the sun had not left the earth, and little aimless\r\nwinds blowing across the rose-gardens to the southward brought the scent\r\nof dried roses and water. Our fire once started, and the dogs craftily\r\ndisposed to wait the dash of the porcupine, we climbed to the top of a\r\nrain-scarred hillock of earth, and looked across the scrub seamed with\r\ncattle paths, white with the long grass, and dotted with spots of level\r\npond-bottom, where the snipe would gather in winter.\r\n\r\n‘This,’ said Ortheris, with a sigh, as he took in the unkempt desolation\r\nof it all, ‘this is sanguinary. This is unusually sanguinary. Sort o’\r\nmad country. Like a grate when the fire’s put out by the sun.’ He shaded\r\nhis eyes against the moonlight. ‘An’ there’s a loony dancin’ in the\r\nmiddle of it all. Quite right. I’d dance too if I wasn’t so downheart.’\r\n\r\nThere pranced a Portent in the face of the moon--a huge and ragged\r\nspirit of the waste, that flapped its wings from afar. It had risen out\r\nof the earth; it was coming towards us, and its outline was never twice\r\nthe same. The toga, table-cloth, or dressing-gown, whatever the creature\r\nwore, took a hundred shapes. Once it stopped on a neighbouring mound and\r\nflung all its legs and arms to the winds.\r\n\r\n‘My, but that scarecrow ‘as got ‘em bad!’ said Ortheris. ‘Seems like if\r\n‘e comes any furder we’ll ‘ave to argify with ‘im.’\r\n\r\nLearoyd raised himself from the dirt as a bull clears his flanks of the\r\nwallow. And as a bull bellows, so he, after a short minute at gaze, gave\r\ntongue to the stars.\r\n\r\n‘MULVAANEY! MULVAANEY! A-hoo!’\r\n\r\nOh then it was that we yelled, and the figure dipped into the hollow,\r\ntill, with a crash of rending grass, the lost one strode up to the light\r\nof the fire and disappeared to the waist in a wave of joyous dogs! Then\r\nLearoyd and Ortheris gave greeting, bass and falsetto together, both\r\nswallowing a lump in the throat.\r\n\r\n‘You damned fool!’ said they, and severally pounded him with their\r\nfists.\r\n\r\n‘Go easy!’ he answered; wrapping a huge arm round each. ‘I would have\r\nyou to know that I am a god, to be treated as such--tho’, by my faith, I\r\nfancy I’ve got to go to the guard-room just like a privit soldier.’\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the sentence destroyed the suspicions raised by the\r\nformer. Any one would have been justified in regarding Mulvaney as mad.\r\nHe was hatless and shoeless, and his shirt and trousers were dropping\r\noff him. But he wore one wondrous garment--a gigantic cloak that\r\nfell from collar-bone to heel--of pale pink silk, wrought all over in\r\ncunningest needlework of hands long since dead, with the loves of the\r\nHindu gods. The monstrous figures leaped in and out of the light of the\r\nfire as he settled the folds round him.\r\n\r\nOrtheris handled the stuff respectfully for a moment while I was trying\r\nto remember where I had seen it before. Then he screamed, ‘What ‘AVE you\r\ndone with the palanquin? You’re wearin’ the linin’.’\r\n\r\n‘I am,’ said the Irishman, ‘an’ by the same token the ‘broidery is\r\nscrapin’ my hide off. I’ve lived in this sumpshus counterpane for four\r\ndays. Me son, I begin to ondherstand why the naygur is no use. Widout me\r\nboots, an’ me trousies like an openwork stocking on a gyurl’s leg at\r\na dance, I begin to feel like a naygur-man--all fearful an’ timoreous.\r\nGive me a pipe an’ I’ll tell on.’\r\n\r\nHe lit a pipe, resumed his grip of his two friends, and rocked to and\r\nfro in a gale of laughter.\r\n\r\n‘Mulvaney,’ said Ortheris sternly, ‘’tain’t no time for laughin’. You’ve\r\ngiven Jock an’ me more trouble than you’re worth. You ‘ave been absent\r\nwithout leave an’ you’ll go into cells for that; an’ you ‘ave come back\r\ndisgustin’ly dressed an’ most improper in the linin’ o’ that bloomin’\r\npalanquin. Instid of which you laugh. An’ WE thought you was dead all\r\nthe time.’\r\n\r\n‘Bhoys,’ said the culprit, still shaking gently, ‘whin I’ve done my tale\r\nyou may cry if you like, an’ little Orth’ris here can thrample my inside\r\nout. Ha’ done an’ listen. My performances have been stupenjus: my luck\r\nhas been the blessed luck av the British Army--an’ there’s no betther\r\nthan that. I went out dhrunk an’ dhrinkin’ in the palanquin, and I have\r\ncome back a pink god. Did any of you go to Dearsley afther my time was\r\nup? He was at the bottom of ut all.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah said so,’ murmured Learoyd. ‘To-morrow ah’ll smash t’ face in upon\r\nhis heead.’\r\n\r\n‘Ye will not. Dearsley’s a jool av a man. Afther Ortheris had put me\r\ninto the palanquin an’ the six bearer-men were gruntin’ down the road, I\r\ntuk thought to mock Dearsley for that fight. So I tould thim, “Go to the\r\nembankmint,” and there, bein’ most amazin’ full, I shtuck my head out\r\nav the concern an’ passed compliments wid Dearsley. I must ha’ miscalled\r\nhim outrageous, for whin I am that way the power av the tongue comes on\r\nme. I can bare remimber tellin’ him that his mouth opened endways like\r\nthe mouth av a skate, which was thrue afther Learoyd had handled ut; an’\r\nI clear remimber his takin’ no manner nor matter av offence, but givin’\r\nme a big dhrink of beer. ‘Twas the beer did the thrick, for I crawled\r\nback into the palanquin, steppin’ on me right ear wid me left foot, an’\r\nthin I slept like the dead. Wanst I half-roused, an’ begad the noise\r\nin my head was tremenjus--roarin’ and rattlin’ an’ poundin’ such as was\r\nquite new to me. “Mother av Mercy,” thinks I, “phwat a concertina I will\r\nhave on my shoulders whin I wake!” An’ wid that I curls mysilf up\r\nto sleep before ut should get hould on me. Bhoys, that noise was not\r\ndhrink, ‘twas the rattle av a thrain!’\r\n\r\nThere followed an impressive pause.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, he had put me on a thrain--put me, palanquin an’ all, an’ six\r\nblack assassins av his own coolies that was in his nefarious confidence,\r\non the flat av a ballast-thruck, and we were rowlin’ an’ bowlin’ along\r\nto Benares. Glory be that I did not wake up thin an’ introjuce mysilf to\r\nthe coolies. As I was sayin’, I slept for the betther part av a day an’\r\na night. But remimber you, that that man Dearsley had packed me off on\r\nwan av his material-thrains to Benares, all for to make me overstay my\r\nleave an’ get me into the cells.’\r\n\r\nThe explanation was an eminently rational one. Benares lay at least ten\r\nhours by rail from the cantonments, and nothing in the world could have\r\nsaved Mulvaney from arrest as a deserter had he appeared there in the\r\napparel of his orgies. Dearsley had not forgotten to take revenge.\r\nLearoyd, drawing back a little, began to place soft blows over selected\r\nportions of Mulvaney’s body. His thoughts were away on the embankment,\r\nand they meditated evil for Dearsley. Mulvaney continued--\r\n\r\n‘Whin I was full awake the palanquin was set down in a street, I\r\nsuspicioned, for I cud hear people passin’ an’ talkin’. But I knew well\r\nI was far from home. There is a queer smell upon our cantonments--a\r\nsmell av dried earth and brick-kilns wid whiffs av cavalry\r\nstable-litter. This place smelt marigold flowers an’ bad water, an’\r\nwanst somethin’ alive came an’ blew heavy with his muzzle at the chink\r\nav the shutter. “It’s in a village I am,” thinks I to mysilf, “an’ the\r\nparochial buffalo is investigatin’ the palanquin.” But anyways I had\r\nno desire to move. Only lie still whin you’re in foreign parts an’ the\r\nstandin’ luck av the British Army will carry ye through. That is an\r\nepigram. I made ut.\r\n\r\n‘Thin a lot av whishperin’ divils surrounded the palanquin. “Take ut\r\nup,” sez wan man. “But who’ll pay us?” sez another. “The Maharanee’s\r\nminister, av coorse,” sez the man. “Oho!” sez I to mysilf, “I’m a quane\r\nin me own right, wid a minister to pay me expenses. I’ll be an emperor\r\nif I lie still long enough; but this is no village I’ve found.” I lay\r\nquiet, but I gummed me right eye to a crack av the shutters, an’ I\r\nsaw that the whole street was crammed wid palanquins an’ horses, an’ a\r\nsprinklin’ av naked priests all yellow powder an’ tigers’ tails. But\r\nI may tell you, Orth’ris, an’ you, Learoyd, that av all the palanquins\r\nours was the most imperial an’ magnificent. Now a palanquin means a\r\nnative lady all the world over, except whin a soldier av the Quane\r\nhappens to be takin’ a ride. “Women an’ priests!” sez I. “Your father’s\r\nson is in the right pew this time, Terence. There will be proceedin’s.”\r\n Six black divils in pink muslin tuk up the palanquin, an’ oh! but the\r\nrowlin’ an’ the rockin’ made me sick. Thin we got fair jammed among the\r\npalanquins--not more than fifty av them--an’ we grated an’ bumped\r\nlike Queenstown potato-smacks in a runnin’ tide. I cud hear the women\r\ngigglin’ and squirkin’ in their palanquins, but mine was the royal\r\nequipage. They made way for ut, an’, begad, the pink muslin men o’ mine\r\nwere howlin’, “Room for the Maharanee av Gokral-Seetarun.” Do you know\r\naught av the lady, sorr?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said I. ‘She is a very estimable old queen of the Central Indian\r\nStates, and they say she is fat. How on earth could she go to Benares\r\nwithout all the city knowing her palanquin?’\r\n\r\n‘’Twas the eternal foolishness av the naygur-man. They saw the palanquin\r\nlying loneful an’ forlornsome, an’ the beauty av ut, after Dearsley’s\r\nmen had dhropped ut and gone away, an’ they gave ut the best name that\r\noccurred to thim. Quite right too. For aught we know the ould lady was\r\nthravellin’ incog--like me. I’m glad to hear she’s fat. I was no light\r\nweight mysilf, an’ my men were mortial anxious to dhrop me under a great\r\nbig archway promiscuously ornamented wid the most improper carvin’s\r\nan’ cuttin’s I iver saw. Begad! they made me blush--like a--like a\r\nMaharanee.’\r\n\r\n‘The temple of Prithi-Devi,’ I murmured, remembering the monstrous\r\nhorrors of that sculptured archway at Benares.\r\n\r\n‘Pretty Devilskins, savin’ your presence, sorr! There was nothin’ pretty\r\nabout ut, except me. ‘Twas all half dhark, an’ whin the coolies left\r\nthey shut a big black gate behind av us, an’ half a company av fat\r\nyellow priests began pully-haulin’ the palanquins into a dharker place\r\nyet--a big stone hall full av pillars, an’ gods, an’ incense, an’ all\r\nmanner av similar thruck. The gate disconcerted me, for I perceived I\r\nwud have to go forward to get out, my retreat bein’ cut off. By the same\r\ntoken a good priest makes a bad palanquin-coolie. Begad! they nearly\r\nturned me inside out draggin’ the palanquin to the temple. Now the\r\ndisposishin av the forces inside was this way. The Maharanee av\r\nGokral-Seetarun--that was me--lay by the favour av Providence on the far\r\nleft flank behind the dhark av a pillar carved with elephints’ heads.\r\nThe remainder av the palanquins was in a big half circle facing in to\r\nthe biggest, fattest, an’ most amazin’ she-god that iver I dreamed av.\r\nHer head ran up into the black above us, an’ her feet stuck out in the\r\nlight av a little fire av melted butter that a priest was feedin’ out\r\nav a butter-dish. Thin a man began to sing an’ play on somethin’ back in\r\nthe dhark, an ‘twas a queer song. Ut made my hair lift on the back av\r\nmy neck. Thin the doors av all the palanquins slid back, an’ the women\r\nbundled out. I saw what I’ll niver see again. ‘Twas more glorious than\r\nthransformations at a pantomime, for they was in pink an’ blue an’\r\nsilver an’ red an’ grass green, wid di’monds an’ im’ralds an’ great red\r\nrubies all over thim. But that was the least part av the glory. O bhoys,\r\nthey were more lovely than the like av any loveliness in hiven; ay,\r\ntheir little bare feet were betther than the white hands av a lord’s\r\nlady, an’ their mouths were like puckered roses, an’ their eyes were\r\nbigger an’ dharker than the eyes av any livin’ women I’ve seen. Ye may\r\nlaugh, but I’m speakin’ truth. I niver saw the like, an’ niver I will\r\nagain.’\r\n\r\n‘Seeing that in all probability you were watching the wives and\r\ndaughters of most of the Kings of India, the chances are that you\r\nwon’t,’ I said, for it was dawning on me that Mulvaney had stumbled upon\r\na big Queens’ Praying at Benares.\r\n\r\n‘I niver will,’ he said mournfully. ‘That sight doesn’t come twist to\r\nany man. It made me ashamed to watch. A fat priest knocked at my door.\r\nI didn’t think he’d have the insolince to disturb the Maharanee av\r\nGokral-Seetarun, so I lay still. “The old cow’s asleep,” sez he to\r\nanother. “Let her be,” sez that. “‘Twill be long before she has a\r\ncalf!” I might ha’ known before he spoke that all a woman prays for in\r\nInjia--an’ for matter o’ that in England too--is childher. That made me\r\nmore sorry I’d come, me bein’, as you well know, a childless man.’\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment, thinking of his little son, dead many years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n‘They prayed, an’ the butter-fires blazed up an’ the incense turned\r\neverything blue, an’ between that an’ the fires the women looked as\r\ntho’ they were all ablaze an’ twinklin’. They took hold av the she-god’s\r\nknees, they cried out an’ they threw themselves about, an’ that\r\nworld-without-end-amen music was dhrivin’ thim mad. Mother av Hiven! how\r\nthey cried, an’ the ould she-god grinnin’ above thim all so scornful!\r\nThe dhrink was dyin’ out in me fast, an’ I was thinkin’ harder than the\r\nthoughts wud go through my head--thinkin’ how to get out, an’ all manner\r\nof nonsense as well. The women were rockin’ in rows, their di’mond belts\r\nclickin’, an’ the tears runnin’ out betune their hands, an’ the lights\r\nwere goin’ lower an’ dharker. Thin there was a blaze like lightnin’ from\r\nthe roof, an’ that showed me the inside av the palanquin, an’ at the end\r\nwhere my foot was, stood the livin’ spit an’ image o’ mysilf worked on\r\nthe linin’. This man here, ut was.’\r\n\r\nHe hunted in the folds of his pink cloak, ran a hand under one, and\r\nthrust into the firelight a foot-long embroidered presentment of the\r\ngreat god Krishna, playing on a flute. The heavy jowl, the staring eye,\r\nand the blue-black moustache of the god made up a far-off resemblance to\r\nMulvaney.\r\n\r\n‘The blaze was gone in a wink, but the whole schame came to me thin. I\r\nbelieve I was mad too. I slid the off-shutter open an’ rowled out into\r\nthe dhark behind the elephint-head pillar, tucked up my trousies to\r\nmy knees, slipped off my boots an’ tuk a general hould av all the pink\r\nlinin’ av the palanquin. Glory be, ut ripped out like a woman’s dhriss\r\nwhin you tread on ut at a sergeants’ ball, an’ a bottle came with ut. I\r\ntuk the bottle an’ the next minut I was out av the dhark av the pillar,\r\nthe pink linin’ wrapped round me most graceful, the music thunderin’\r\nlike kettledrums, an’ a could draft blowin’ round my bare legs. By this\r\nhand that did ut, I was Khrishna tootlin’ on the flute--the god that the\r\nrig’mental chaplain talks about. A sweet sight I must ha’ looked. I knew\r\nmy eyes were big, and my face was wax-white, an’ at the worst I must\r\nha’ looked like a ghost. But they took me for the livin’ god. The music\r\nstopped, and the women were dead dumb an’ I crooked my legs like a\r\nshepherd on a china basin, an’ I did the ghost-waggle with my feet as I\r\nhad done ut at the rig’mental theatre many times, an’ I slid acrost\r\nthe width av that temple in front av the she-god tootlin’ on the beer\r\nbottle.’\r\n\r\n‘Wot did you toot?’ demanded Ortheris the practical.\r\n\r\n‘Me? Oh!’ Mulvaney sprang up, suiting the action to the word, and\r\nsliding gravely in front of us, a dilapidated but imposing deity in the\r\nhalf light. ‘I sang--\r\n\r\n    ‘Only say\r\n     You’ll be Mrs. Brallaghan.\r\n     Don’t say nay,\r\n     Charmin’ Judy Callaghan.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know me own voice when I sang. An’ oh! ‘twas pitiful to see the\r\nwomen. The darlin’s were down on their faces. Whin I passed the last\r\nwan I cud see her poor little fingers workin’ one in another as if she\r\nwanted to touch my feet. So I dhrew the tail av this pink overcoat over\r\nher head for the greater honour, an’ I slid into the dhark on the other\r\nside av the temple, and fetched up in the arms av a big fat priest. All\r\nI wanted was to get away clear. So I tuk him by his greasy throat\r\nan’ shut the speech out av him. “Out!” sez I. “Which way, ye fat\r\nheathen?”--“Oh!” sez he. “Man,” sez I. “White man, soldier man, common\r\nsoldier man. Where in the name av confusion is the back door?” The women\r\nin the temple were still on their faces, an’ a young priest was holdin’\r\nout his arms above their heads.\r\n\r\n‘“This way,” sez my fat friend, duckin’ behind a big bull-god an’ divin’\r\ninto a passage. Thin I remimbered that I must ha’ made the miraculous\r\nreputation av that temple for the next fifty years. “Not so fast,” I\r\nsez, an’ I held out both my hands wid a wink. That ould thief smiled\r\nlike a father. I tuk him by the back av the neck in case he should be\r\nwishful to put a knife into me unbeknownst, an’ I ran him up an’ down\r\nthe passage twice to collect his sensibilities! “Be quiet,” sez he, in\r\nEnglish. “Now you talk sense,” I sez. “Fwhat ‘ll you give me for the\r\nuse av that most iligant palanquin I have no time to take away?”--“Don’t\r\ntell,” sez he. “Is ut like?” sez I. “But ye might give me my railway\r\nfare. I’m far from my home an’ I’ve done you a service.” Bhoys, ‘tis a\r\ngood thing to be a priest. The ould man niver throubled himself to dhraw\r\nfrom a bank. As I will prove to you subsequint, he philandered all round\r\nthe slack av his clothes an’ began dribblin’ ten-rupee notes, old gold\r\nmohurs, and rupees into my hand till I could hould no more.’\r\n\r\n‘You lie!’ said Ortheris. ‘You’re mad or sunstrook. A native don’t give\r\ncoin unless you cut it out o’ ‘im. ‘Tain’t nature.’\r\n\r\n‘Then my lie an’ my sunstroke is concealed under that lump av sod\r\nyonder,’ retorted Mulvaney unruffled, nodding across the scrub. ‘An’\r\nthere’s a dale more in nature than your squidgy little legs have iver\r\ntaken you to, Orth’ris, me son. Four hundred an’ thirty-four rupees\r\nby my reckonin’, AN’ a big fat gold necklace that I took from him as a\r\nremimbrancer, was our share in that business.’\r\n\r\n‘An’ ‘e give it you for love?’ said Ortheris.\r\n\r\n‘We were alone in that passage. Maybe I was a trifle too pressin’,\r\nbut considher fwhat I had done for the good av the temple and the\r\niverlastin’ joy av those women. ‘Twas cheap at the price. I wud ha’\r\ntaken more if I cud ha’ found ut. I turned the ould man upside down\r\nat the last, but he was milked dhry. Thin he opened a door in another\r\npassage an’ I found mysilf up to my knees in Benares river-water, an’\r\nbad smellin’ ut is. More by token I had come out on the river-line close\r\nto the burnin’ ghat and contagious to a cracklin’ corpse. This was in\r\nthe heart av the night, for I had been four hours in the temple. There\r\nwas a crowd av boats tied up, so I tuk wan an’ wint across the river.\r\nThin I came home acrost country, lyin’ up by day.’\r\n\r\n‘How on earth did you manage?’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘How did Sir Frederick Roberts get from Cabul to Candahar? He marched\r\nan’ he niver tould how near he was to breakin’ down. That’s why he is\r\nfwhat he is. An’ now--’ Mulvaney yawned portentously. ‘Now I will go an’\r\ngive myself up for absince widout leave. It’s eight an’ twenty days an’\r\nthe rough end of the colonel’s tongue in orderly room, any way you look\r\nat ut. But ‘tis cheap at the price.’\r\n\r\n‘Mulvaney,’ said I softly. ‘If there happens to be any sort of excuse\r\nthat the colonel can in any way accept, I have a notion that you’ll get\r\nnothing more than the dressing-gown. The new recruits are in, and--’\r\n\r\n‘Not a word more, sorr. Is ut excuses the old man wants? ‘Tis not my\r\nway, but he shall have thim. I’ll tell him I was engaged in financial\r\noperations connected wid a church,’ and he flapped his way to\r\ncantonments and the cells, singing lustily--\r\n\r\n    ‘So they sent a corp’ril’s file,\r\n     And they put me in the gyard-room\r\n     For conduck unbecomin’ of a soldier.’\r\n\r\nAnd when he was lost in the midst of the moonlight we could hear the\r\nrefrain--\r\n\r\n     Bang upon the big drum, bash upon the cymbals,\r\n     As we go marchin’ along, boys, oh!\r\n     For although in this campaign\r\n     There’s no whisky nor champagne,\r\n     We’ll keep our spirits goin’ with a song, boys!’\r\n\r\nTherewith he surrendered himself to the joyful and almost weeping guard,\r\nand was made much of by his fellows. But to the colonel he said that he\r\nhad been smitten with sunstroke and had lain insensible on a villager’s\r\ncot for untold hours; and between laughter and goodwill the affair was\r\nsmoothed over, so that he could, next day, teach the new recruits how to\r\n‘Fear God, Honour the Queen, Shoot Straight, and Keep Clean.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURTING OF DINAH SHADD\r\n\r\n\r\n     What did the colonel’s lady think?\r\n       Nobody never knew.\r\n     Somebody asked the sergeant’s wife\r\n       An’ she told ‘em true.\r\n     When you git to a man in the case\r\n       They’re like a row o’ pins,\r\n     For the colonel’s lady an’ Judy O’Grady\r\n       Are sisters under their skins.\r\n                          BARRACK-ROOM BALLAD.\r\n\r\nAl day I had followed at the heels of a pursuing army engaged on one of\r\nthe finest battles that ever camp of exercise beheld. Thirty thousand\r\ntroops had by the wisdom of the Government of India been turned loose\r\nover a few thousand square miles of country to practise in peace what\r\nthey would never attempt in war. Consequently cavalry charged unshaken\r\ninfantry at the trot. Infantry captured artillery by frontal attacks\r\ndelivered in line of quarter columns, and mounted infantry skirmished\r\nup to the wheels of an armoured train which carried nothing more deadly\r\nthan a twenty-five pounder Armstrong, two Nordenfeldts, and a few score\r\nvolunteers all cased in three-eighths-inch boiler-plate. Yet it was a\r\nvery lifelike camp. Operations did not cease at sundown; nobody knew\r\nthe country and nobody spared man or horse. There was unending cavalry\r\nscouting and almost unending forced work over broken ground. The Army of\r\nthe South had finally pierced the centre of the Army of the North, and\r\nwas pouring through the gap hot-foot to capture a city of strategic\r\nimportance. Its front extended fanwise, the sticks being represented by\r\nregiments strung out along the line of route backwards to the divisional\r\ntransport columns and all the lumber that trails behind an army on the\r\nmove. On its right the broken left of the Army of the North was flying\r\nin mass, chased by the Southern horse and hammered by the Southern guns\r\ntill these had been pushed far beyond the limits of their last support.\r\nThen the flying sat down to rest, while the elated commandant of the\r\npursuing force telegraphed that he held all in check and observation.\r\n\r\nUnluckily he did not observe that three miles to his right flank a\r\nflying column of Northern horse with a detachment of Ghoorkhas and\r\nBritish troops had been pushed round, as fast as the failing light\r\nallowed, to cut across the entire rear of the Southern Army, to break,\r\nas it were, all the ribs of the fan where they converged by striking\r\nat the transport, reserve ammunition, and artillery supplies. Their\r\ninstructions were to go in, avoiding the few scouts who might not have\r\nbeen drawn off by the pursuit, and create sufficient excitement to\r\nimpress the Southern Army with the wisdom of guarding their own flank\r\nand rear before they captured cities. It was a pretty manoeuvre, neatly\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for the second division of the Southern Army, our first\r\nintimation of the attack was at twilight, when the artillery were\r\nlabouring in deep sand, most of the escort were trying to help them\r\nout, and the main body of the infantry had gone on. A Noah’s Ark of\r\nelephants, camels, and the mixed menagerie of an Indian transport-train\r\nbubbled and squealed behind the guns when there appeared from nowhere in\r\nparticular British infantry to the extent of three companies, who sprang\r\nto the heads of the gun-horses and brought all to a standstill amid\r\noaths and cheers.\r\n\r\n‘How’s that, umpire?’ said the major commanding the attack, and with one\r\nvoice the drivers and limber gunners answered ‘Hout!’ while the colonel\r\nof artillery sputtered.\r\n\r\n‘All your scouts are charging our main body,’ said the major. ‘Your\r\nflanks are unprotected for two miles. I think we’ve broken the back of\r\nthis division. And listen,--there go the Ghoorkhas!’\r\n\r\nA weak fire broke from the rear-guard more than a mile away, and was\r\nanswered by cheerful howlings. The Ghoorkhas, who should have swung\r\nclear of the second division, had stepped on its tail in the dark, but\r\ndrawing off hastened to reach the next line of attack, which lay almost\r\nparallel to us five or six miles away.\r\n\r\nOur column swayed and surged irresolutely,--three batteries, the\r\ndivisional ammunition reserve, the baggage, and a section of the\r\nhospital and bearer corps. The commandant ruefully promised to report\r\nhimself ‘cut up’ to the nearest umpire, and commending his cavalry and\r\nall other cavalry to the special care of Eblis, toiled on to resume\r\ntouch with the rest of the division.\r\n\r\n‘We’ll bivouac here to-night,’ said the major, ‘I have a notion that the\r\nGhoorkhas will get caught. They may want us to re-form on. Stand easy\r\ntill the transport gets away.’\r\n\r\nA hand caught my beast’s bridle and led him out of the choking dust; a\r\nlarger hand deftly canted me out of the saddle; and two of the hugest\r\nhands in the world received me sliding. Pleasant is the lot of the\r\nspecial correspondent who falls into such hands as those of Privates\r\nMulvaney, Ortheris, and Learoyd.\r\n\r\n‘An’ that’s all right,’ said the Irishman calmly. ‘We thought we’d find\r\nyou somewheres here by. Is there anything av yours in the transport?\r\nOrth’ris ‘ll fetch ut out.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris did ‘fetch ut out,’ from under the trunk of an elephant, in the\r\nshape of a servant and an animal both laden with medical comforts. The\r\nlittle man’s eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n‘If the brutil an’ licentious soldiery av these parts gets sight av the\r\nthruck,’ said Mulvaney, making practised investigations, ‘they’ll loot\r\nev’rything. They’re bein’ fed on iron-filin’s an’ dog-biscuit these\r\ndays, but glory’s no compensation for a belly-ache. Praise be, we’re\r\nhere to protect you, sorr. Beer, sausage, bread (soft an’ that’s a\r\ncur’osity), soup in a tin, whisky by the smell av ut, an’ fowls! Mother\r\nav Moses, but ye take the field like a confectioner! ‘Tis scand’lus.’\r\n\r\n‘Ere’s a orficer,’ said Ortheris significantly. ‘When the sergent’s done\r\nlushin’ the privit may clean the pot.’\r\n\r\nI bundled several things into Mulvaney’s haversack before the major’s\r\nhand fell on my shoulder and he said tenderly, ‘Requisitioned for the\r\nQueen’s service. Wolseley was quite wrong about special correspondents:\r\nthey are the soldier’s best friends. Come and take pot-luck with us\r\nto-night.’\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened amid laughter and shoutings that my well-considered\r\ncommissariat melted away to reappear later at the mess-table, which was\r\na waterproof sheet spread on the ground. The flying column had taken\r\nthree days’ rations with it, and there be few things nastier than\r\ngovernment rations--especially when government is experimenting\r\nwith German toys. Erbsenwurst, tinned beef of surpassing tinniness,\r\ncompressed vegetables, and meat-biscuits may be nourishing, but what\r\nThomas Atkins needs is bulk in his inside. The major, assisted by\r\nhis brother officers, purchased goats for the camp and so made the\r\nexperiment of no effect. Long before the fatigue-party sent to collect\r\nbrushwood had returned, the men were settled down by their valises,\r\nkettles and pots had appeared from the surrounding country and were\r\ndangling over fires as the kid and the compressed vegetable bubbled\r\ntogether; there rose a cheerful clinking of mess-tins; outrageous\r\ndemands for ‘a little more stuffin’ with that there liver-wing;’ and\r\ngust on gust of chaff as pointed as a bayonet and as delicate as a\r\ngun-butt.\r\n\r\n‘The boys are in a good temper,’ said the major. ‘They’ll be singing\r\npresently. Well, a night like this is enough to keep them happy.’\r\n\r\nOver our heads burned the wonderful Indian stars, which are not all\r\npricked in on one plane, but, preserving an orderly perspective, draw\r\nthe eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors\r\nof heaven itself. The earth was a gray shadow more unreal than the sky.\r\nWe could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of\r\nthe jackals, the movement of the wind in the tamarisks, and the fitful\r\nmutter of musketry-fire leagues away to the left. A native woman from\r\nsome unseen hut began to sing, the mail-train thundered past on its\r\nway to Delhi, and a roosting crow cawed drowsily. Then there was a\r\nbelt-loosening silence about the fires, and the even breathing of the\r\ncrowded earth took up the story.\r\n\r\nThe men, full fed, turned to tobacco and song,--their officers with\r\nthem. The subaltern is happy who can win the approval of the musical\r\ncritics in his regiment, and is honoured among the more intricate\r\nstep-dancers. By him, as by him who plays cricket cleverly, Thomas\r\nAtkins will stand in time of need, when he will let a better officer\r\ngo on alone. The ruined tombs of forgotten Mussulman saints heard the\r\nballad of Agra Town, The Buffalo Battery, Marching to Kabul, The long,\r\nlong Indian Day, The Place where the Punkah-coolie died, and that\r\ncrashing chorus which announces,\r\n\r\n     Youth’s daring spirit, manhood’s fire,\r\n       Firm hand and eagle eye,\r\n     Must he acquire who would aspire\r\n       To see the gray boar die.\r\n\r\nTo-day, of all those jovial thieves who appropriated my commissariat and\r\nlay and laughed round that water-proof sheet, not one remains. They went\r\nto camps that were not of exercise and battles without umpires. Burmah,\r\nthe Soudan, and the frontier,--fever and fight,--took them in their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI drifted across to the men’s fires in search of Mulvaney, whom I\r\nfound strategically greasing his feet by the blaze. There is nothing\r\nparticularly lovely in the sight of a private thus engaged after a long\r\nday’s march, but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the ‘might,\r\nmajesty, dominion, and power’ of the British Empire which stands on\r\nthose feet you take an interest in the proceedings.\r\n\r\n‘There’s a blister, bad luck to ut, on the heel,’ said Mulvaney. ‘I\r\ncan’t touch ut. Prick ut out, little man.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris took out his house-wife, eased the trouble with a needle,\r\nstabbed Mulvaney in the calf with the same weapon, and was swiftly\r\nkicked into the fire.\r\n\r\n‘I’ve bruk the best av my toes over you, ye grinnin’ child av\r\ndisruption,’ said Mulvaney, sitting cross-legged and nursing his feet;\r\nthen seeing me, ‘Oh, ut’s you, sorr! Be welkim, an’ take that maraudin’\r\nscutt’s place. Jock, hold him down on the cindhers for a bit.’\r\n\r\nBut Ortheris escaped and went elsewhere, as I took possession of the\r\nhollow he had scraped for himself and lined with his greatcoat. Learoyd\r\non the other side of the fire grinned affably and in a minute fell fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n‘There’s the height av politeness for you,’ said Mulvaney, lighting\r\nhis pipe with a flaming branch. ‘But Jock’s eaten half a box av your\r\nsardines at wan gulp, an’ I think the tin too. What’s the best wid you,\r\nsorr, an’ how did you happen to be on the losin’ side this day whin we\r\ncaptured you?’\r\n\r\n‘The Army of the South is winning all along the line,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘Then that line’s the hangman’s rope, savin’ your presence. You’ll\r\nlearn to-morrow how we rethreated to dhraw thim on before we made thim\r\ntrouble, an’ that’s what a woman does. By the same tokin, we’ll be\r\nattacked before the dawnin’ an’ ut would be betther not to slip your\r\nboots. How do I know that? By the light av pure reason. Here are three\r\ncompanies av us ever so far inside av the enemy’s flank an’ a crowd av\r\nroarin’, tarin’, squealin’ cavalry gone on just to turn out the whole\r\nhornet’s nest av them. Av course the enemy will pursue, by brigades like\r\nas not, an’ thin we’ll have to run for ut. Mark my words. I am av the\r\nopinion av Polonius whin he said, “Don’t fight wid ivry scutt for the\r\npure joy av fightin’, but if you do, knock the nose av him first an’\r\nfrequint.” We ought to ha’ gone on an’ helped the Ghoorkhas.’\r\n\r\n‘But what do you know about Polonius?’ I demanded. This was a new side\r\nof Mulvaney’s character.\r\n\r\n‘All that Shakespeare iver wrote an’ a dale more that the gallery\r\nshouted,’ said the man of war, carefully lacing his boots. ‘Did I not\r\ntell you av Silver’s theatre in Dublin, whin I was younger than I am now\r\nan’ a patron av the drama? Ould Silver wud never pay actor-man or woman\r\ntheir just dues, an’ by consequince his comp’nies was collapsible at the\r\nlast minut. Thin the bhoys wud clamour to take a part, an’ oft as not\r\nould Silver made them pay for the fun. Faith, I’ve seen Hamlut played\r\nwid a new black eye an’ the queen as full as a cornucopia. I remimber\r\nwanst Hogin that ‘listed in the Black Tyrone an’ was shot in South\r\nAfrica, he sejuced ould Silver into givin’ him Hamlut’s part instid av\r\nme that had a fine fancy for rhetoric in those days. Av course I wint\r\ninto the gallery an’ began to fill the pit wid other people’s hats,\r\nan’ I passed the time av day to Hogin walkin’ through Denmark like a\r\nhamstrung mule wid a pall on his back. “Hamlut,” sez I, “there’s a hole\r\nin your heel. Pull up your shtockin’s, Hamlut,” sez I, “Hamlut, Hamlut,\r\nfor the love av decincy dhrop that skull an’ pull up your shtockin’s.”\r\n The whole house begun to tell him that. He stopped his soliloquishms\r\nmid-between. “My shtockin’s may be comin’ down or they may not,” sez\r\nhe, screwin’ his eye into the gallery, for well he knew who I was. “But\r\nafther this performince is over me an’ the Ghost ‘ll trample the tripes\r\nout av you, Terence, wid your ass’s bray!” An’ that’s how I come to know\r\nabout Hamlut. Eyah! Those days, those days! Did you iver have onendin’\r\ndevilmint an’ nothin’ to pay for it in your life, sorr?’\r\n\r\n‘Never, without having to pay,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘That’s thrue! ‘Tis mane whin you considher on ut; but ut’s the same wid\r\nhorse or fut. A headache if you dhrink, an’ a belly-ache if you eat too\r\nmuch, an’ a heart-ache to kape all down. Faith, the beast only gets the\r\ncolic, an’ he’s the lucky man.’\r\n\r\nHe dropped his head and stared into the fire, fingering his moustache\r\nthe while. From the far side of the bivouac the voice of Corbet-Nolan,\r\nsenior subaltern of B company, uplifted itself in an ancient and much\r\nappreciated song of sentiment, the men moaning melodiously behind him.\r\n\r\n     The north wind blew coldly, she drooped from that hour,\r\n     My own little Kathleen, my sweet little Kathleen,\r\n     Kathleen, my Kathleen, Kathleen O’Moore!\r\n\r\nWith forty-five O’s in the last word: even at that distance you might\r\nhave cut the soft South Irish accent with a shovel.\r\n\r\n‘For all we take we must pay, but the price is cruel high,’ murmured\r\nMulvaney when the chorus had ceased.\r\n\r\n‘What’s the trouble?’ I said gently, for I knew that he was a man of an\r\ninextinguishable sorrow.\r\n\r\n‘Hear now,’ said he. ‘Ye know what I am now. _I_ know what I mint to be\r\nat the beginnin’ av my service. I’ve tould you time an’ again, an’ what\r\nI have not Dinah Shadd has. An’ what am I? Oh, Mary Mother av Hiven, an\r\nould dhrunken, untrustable baste av a privit that has seen the reg’ment\r\nchange out from colonel to drummer-boy, not wanst or twice, but scores\r\nav times! Ay, scores! An’ me not so near gettin’ promotion as in the\r\nfirst! An’ me livin’ on an’ kapin’ clear av clink, not by my own good\r\nconduck, but the kindness av some orf’cer-bhoy young enough to be son\r\nto me! Do I not know ut? Can I not tell whin I’m passed over at p’rade,\r\ntho’ I’m rockin’ full av liquor an’ ready to fall all in wan piece,\r\nsuch as even a suckin’ child might see, bekaze, “Oh, ‘tis only ould\r\nMulvaney!” An’ whin I’m let off in ord’ly-room through some thrick of\r\nthe tongue an’ a ready answer an’ the ould man’s mercy, is ut smilin’\r\nI feel whin I fall away an’ go back to Dinah Shadd, thryin’ to carry ut\r\nall off as a joke? Not I! ‘Tis hell to me, dumb hell through ut all;\r\nan’ next time whin the fit comes I will be as bad again. Good cause the\r\nreg’ment has to know me for the best soldier in ut. Better cause have I\r\nto know mesilf for the worst man. I’m only fit to tache the new drafts\r\nwhat I’ll niver learn mesilf; an’ I am sure, as tho’ I heard ut, that\r\nthe minut wan av these pink-eyed recruities gets away from my “Mind\r\nye now,” an’ “Listen to this, Jim, bhoy,”--sure I am that the\r\nsergint houlds me up to him for a warnin’. So I tache, as they say at\r\nmusketry-instruction, by direct and ricochet fire. Lord be good to me,\r\nfor I have stud some throuble!’\r\n\r\n‘Lie down and go to sleep,’ said I, not being able to comfort or advise.\r\n‘You’re the best man in the regiment, and, next to Ortheris, the biggest\r\nfool. Lie down and wait till we’re attacked. What force will they turn\r\nout? Guns, think you?’\r\n\r\n‘Try that wid your lorrds an’ ladies, twistin’ an’ turnin’ the talk,\r\ntho’ you mint ut well. Ye cud say nothin’ to help me, an’ yet ye niver\r\nknew what cause I had to be what I am.’\r\n\r\n‘Begin at the beginning and go on to the end,’ I said royally. ‘But rake\r\nup the fire a bit first.’\r\n\r\nI passed Ortheris’s bayonet for a poker.\r\n\r\n‘That shows how little we know what we do,’ said Mulvaney, putting it\r\naside. ‘Fire takes all the heart out av the steel, an’ the next time,\r\nmay be, that our little man is fighting for his life his bradawl\r\n‘ll break, an’ so you’ll ha’ killed him, manin’ no more than to kape\r\nyourself warm. ‘Tis a recruity’s thrick that. Pass the clanin’-rod,\r\nsorr.’\r\n\r\nI snuggled down abased; and after an interval the voice of Mulvaney\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n‘Did I iver tell you how Dinah Shadd came to be wife av mine?’\r\n\r\nI dissembled a burning anxiety that I had felt for some months--ever\r\nsince Dinah Shadd, the strong, the patient, and the infinitely tender,\r\nhad of her own good love and free will washed a shirt for me, moving in\r\na barren land where washing was not.\r\n\r\n‘I can’t remember,’ I said casually. ‘Was it before or after you made\r\nlove to Annie Bragin, and got no satisfaction?’\r\n\r\nThe story of Annie Bragin is written in another place. It is one of the\r\nmany less respectable episodes in Mulvaney’s chequered career.\r\n\r\n‘Before--before--long before, was that business av Annie Bragin an’ the\r\ncorp’ril’s ghost. Niver woman was the worse for me whin I had married\r\nDinah. There’s a time for all things, an’ I know how to kape all things\r\nin place--barrin’ the dhrink, that kapes me in my place wid no hope av\r\ncomin’ to be aught else.’\r\n\r\n‘Begin at the beginning,’ I insisted. ‘Mrs. Mulvaney told me that you\r\nmarried her when you were quartered in Krab Bokhar barracks.’\r\n\r\n‘An’ the same is a cess-pit,’ said Mulvaney piously. ‘She spoke thrue,\r\ndid Dinah. ‘Twas this way. Talkin’ av that, have ye iver fallen in love,\r\nsorr?’\r\n\r\nI preserved the silence of the damned. Mulvaney continued--\r\n\r\n‘Thin I will assume that ye have not. _I_ did. In the days av my youth,\r\nas I have more than wanst tould you, I was a man that filled the eye an’\r\ndelighted the sowl av women. Niver man was hated as I have bin. Niver\r\nman was loved as I--no, not within half a day’s march av ut! For the\r\nfirst five years av my service, whin I was what I wud give my sowl to be\r\nnow, I tuk whatever was within my reach an’ digested ut--an that’s\r\nmore than most men can say. Dhrink I tuk, an’ ut did me no harm. By the\r\nHollow av Hiven, I cud play wid four women at wanst, an’ kape them from\r\nfindin’ out anythin’ about the other three, an’ smile like a full-blown\r\nmarigold through ut all. Dick Coulhan, av the battery we’ll have down on\r\nus to-night, could drive his team no betther than I mine, an’ I hild\r\nthe worser cattle! An’ so I lived, an’ so I was happy till afther\r\nthat business wid Annie Bragin--she that turned me off as cool as a\r\nmeat-safe, an’ taught me where I stud in the mind av an honest woman.\r\n‘Twas no sweet dose to swallow.\r\n\r\n‘Afther that I sickened awhile an’ tuk thought to my reg’mental work;\r\nconceiting mesilf I wud study an’ be a sergint, an’ a major-gineral\r\ntwinty minutes afther that. But on top av my ambitiousness there was an\r\nempty place in my sowl, an’ me own opinion av mesilf cud not fill ut.\r\nSez I to mesilf, “Terence, you’re a great man an’ the best set-up in the\r\nreg’mint. Go on an’ get promotion.” Sez mesilf to me, “What for?” Sez\r\nI to mesilf, “For the glory av ut!” Sez mesilf to me, “Will that fill\r\nthese two strong arrums av yours, Terence?” “Go to the devil,” sez I\r\nto mesilf. “Go to the married lines,” sez mesilf to me. “‘Tis the same\r\nthing,” sez I to mesilf. “Av you’re the same man, ut is,” said mesilf\r\nto me; an’ wid that I considhered on ut a long while. Did you iver feel\r\nthat way, sorr?’\r\n\r\nI snored gently, knowing that if Mulvaney were uninterrupted he would\r\ngo on. The clamour from the bivouac fires beat up to the stars, as the\r\nrival singers of the companies were pitted against each other.\r\n\r\n‘So I felt that way an’ a bad time ut was. Wanst, bein’ a fool, I\r\nwint into the married lines more for the sake av spakin’ to our ould\r\ncolour-sergint Shadd than for any thruck wid women-folk. I was a\r\ncorp’ril then--rejuced aftherwards, but a corp’ril then. I’ve got a\r\nphotograft av mesilf to prove ut. “You’ll take a cup av tay wid us?” sez\r\nShadd. “I will that,” I sez, “tho’ tay is not my divarsion.”\r\n\r\n‘“‘Twud be better for you if ut were,” sez ould Mother Shadd, an’\r\nshe had ought to know, for Shadd, in the ind av his service, dhrank\r\nbung-full each night.\r\n\r\n‘Wid that I tuk off my gloves--there was pipe-clay in thim, so that they\r\nstud alone--an’ pulled up my chair, lookin’ round at the china ornaments\r\nan’ bits av things in the Shadds’ quarters. They were things that\r\nbelonged to a man, an’ no camp-kit, here to-day an’ dishipated next.\r\n“You’re comfortable in this place, sergint,” sez I. “‘Tis the wife\r\nthat did ut, boy,” sez he, pointin’ the stem av his pipe to ould Mother\r\nShadd, an’ she smacked the top av his bald head apon the compliment.\r\n“That manes you want money,” sez she.\r\n\r\n‘An’ thin--an’ thin whin the kettle was to be filled, Dinah came in--my\r\nDinah--her sleeves rowled up to the elbow an’ her hair in a winkin’\r\nglory over her forehead, the big blue eyes beneath twinklin’ like\r\nstars on a frosty night, an’ the tread av her two feet lighter than\r\nwaste-paper from the colonel’s basket in ord’ly-room whin ut’s emptied.\r\nBein’ but a shlip av a girl she went pink at seein’ me, an’ I twisted me\r\nmoustache an’ looked at a picture forninst the wall. Niver show a\r\nwoman that ye care the snap av a finger for her, an’ begad she’ll come\r\nbleatin’ to your boot-heels!’\r\n\r\n‘I suppose that’s why you followed Annie Bragin till everybody in the\r\nmarried quarters laughed at you,’ said I, remembering that unhallowed\r\nwooing and casting off the disguise of drowsiness.\r\n\r\n‘I’m layin’ down the gin’ral theory av the attack,’ said Mulvaney,\r\ndriving his boot into the dying fire. ‘If you read the Soldier’s\r\nPocket Book, which niver any soldier reads, you’ll see that there\r\nare exceptions. Whin Dinah was out av the door (an’ ‘twas as tho’ the\r\nsunlight had shut too)--“Mother av Hiven, sergint,” sez I, “but is that\r\nyour daughter?”--“I’ve believed that way these eighteen years,” sez ould\r\nShadd, his eyes twinklin’; “but Mrs. Shadd has her own opinion, like\r\niv’ry woman,”--“‘Tis wid yours this time, for a mericle,” sez Mother\r\nShadd. “Thin why in the name av fortune did I niver see her before?”\r\n sez I. “Bekaze you’ve been thrapesin’ round wid the married women these\r\nthree years past. She was a bit av a child till last year, an’ she shot\r\nup wid the spring,” sez ould Mother Shadd. “I’ll thrapese no more,” sez\r\nI. “D’you mane that?” sez ould Mother Shadd, lookin’ at me side-ways\r\nlike a hen looks at a hawk whin the chickens are runnin’ free. “Try me,\r\nan’ tell,” sez I. Wid that I pulled on my gloves, dhrank off the tay,\r\nan’ went out av the house as stiff as at gin’ral p’rade, for well I knew\r\nthat Dinah Shadd’s eyes were in the small av my back out av the scullery\r\nwindow. Faith! that was the only time I mourned I was not a cav’lry-man\r\nfor the pride av the spurs to jingle.\r\n\r\n‘I wint out to think, an’ I did a powerful lot av thinkin’, but ut all\r\ncame round to that shlip av a girl in the dotted blue dhress, wid the\r\nblue eyes an’ the sparkil in them. Thin I kept off canteen, an’ I kept\r\nto the married quarthers, or near by, on the chanst av meetin’ Dinah.\r\nDid I meet her? Oh, my time past, did I not; wid a lump in my throat as\r\nbig as my valise an’ my heart goin’ like a farrier’s forge on a Saturday\r\nmorning? ‘Twas “Good day to ye, Miss Dinah,” an’ “Good day t’you,\r\ncorp’ril,” for a week or two, and divil a bit further could I get bekaze\r\nav the respect I had to that girl that I cud ha’ broken betune finger\r\nan’ thumb.’\r\n\r\nHere I giggled as I recalled the gigantic figure of Dinah Shadd when she\r\nhanded me my shirt.\r\n\r\n‘Ye may laugh,’ grunted Mulvaney. ‘But I’m speakin’ the trut’, an\r\n‘tis you that are in fault. Dinah was a girl that wud ha’ taken the\r\nimperiousness out av the Duchess av Clonmel in those days. Flower hand,\r\nfoot av shod air, an’ the eyes av the livin’ mornin’ she had that is my\r\nwife to-day--ould Dinah, and niver aught else than Dinah Shadd to me.\r\n\r\n‘’Twas after three weeks standin’ off an’ on, an’ niver makin’ headway\r\nexcipt through the eyes, that a little drummer-boy grinned in me face\r\nwhin I had admonished him wid the buckle av my belt for riotin’ all over\r\nthe place. “An’ I’m not the only wan that doesn’t kape to barricks,”\r\n sez he. I tuk him by the scruff av his neck,--my heart was hung on a\r\nhair-thrigger those days, you will onderstand--an’ “Out wid ut,” sez I,\r\n“or I’ll lave no bone av you unbreakable.”--“Speak to Dempsey,” sez he\r\nhowlin’. “Dempsey which?” sez I, “ye unwashed limb av Satan.”--“Av the\r\nBob-tailed Dhragoons,” sez he. “He’s seen her home from her aunt’s\r\nhouse in the civil lines four times this fortnight.”--“Child!” sez\r\nI, dhroppin’ him, “your tongue’s stronger than your body. Go to your\r\nquarters. I’m sorry I dhressed you down.”\r\n\r\n‘At that I went four ways to wanst huntin’ Dempsey. I was mad to think\r\nthat wid all my airs among women I shud ha’ been chated by a basin-faced\r\nfool av a cav’lry-man not fit to trust on a trunk. Presintly I found\r\nhim in our lines--the Bobtails was quartered next us--an’ a tallowy,\r\ntopheavy son av a she-mule he was wid his big brass spurs an’ his\r\nplastrons on his epigastrons an’ all. But he niver flinched a hair.\r\n\r\n‘“A word wid you, Dempsey,” sez I. “You’ve walked wid Dinah Shadd four\r\ntimes this fortnight gone.”\r\n\r\n‘“What’s that to you?” sez he. “I’ll walk forty times more, an’ forty on\r\ntop av that, ye shovel-futted clod-breakin’ infantry lance-corp’ril.”\r\n\r\n‘Before I cud gyard he had his gloved fist home on my cheek an’ down\r\nI went full-sprawl. “Will that content you?” sez he, blowin’ on his\r\nknuckles for all the world like a Scots Greys orf’cer. “Content!” sez\r\nI. “For your own sake, man, take off your spurs, peel your jackut, an’\r\nonglove. ‘Tis the beginnin’ av the overture; stand up!”\r\n\r\n‘He stud all he know, but he niver peeled his jackut, an’ his shoulders\r\nhad no fair play. I was fightin’ for Dinah Shadd an’ that cut on my\r\ncheek. What hope had he forninst me? “Stand up,” sez I, time an’ again\r\nwhin he was beginnin’ to quarter the ground an’ gyard high an’ go large.\r\n“This isn’t ridin’-school,” I sez. “O man, stand up an’ let me get in\r\nat ye.” But whin I saw he wud be runnin’ about, I grup his shtock in\r\nmy left an’ his waist-belt in my right an’ swung him clear to my right\r\nfront, head undher, he hammerin’ my nose till the wind was knocked out\r\nav him on the bare ground. “Stand up,” sez I, “or I’ll kick your head\r\ninto your chest!” and I wud ha’ done ut too, so ragin’ mad I was.\r\n\r\n‘“My collar-bone’s bruk,” sez he. “Help me back to lines. I’ll walk wid\r\nher no more.” So I helped him back.’\r\n\r\n‘And was his collar-bone broken?’ I asked, for I fancied that only\r\nLearoyd could neatly accomplish that terrible throw.\r\n\r\n‘He pitched on his left shoulder-point. Ut was. Next day the news was in\r\nboth barricks, an’ whin I met Dinah Shadd wid a cheek on me like all the\r\nreg’mintal tailor’s samples there was no “Good mornin’, corp’ril,”\r\n or aught else. “An’ what have I done, Miss Shadd,” sez I, very bould,\r\nplantin’ mesilf forninst her, “that ye should not pass the time of day?”\r\n\r\n‘“Ye’ve half-killed rough-rider Dempsey,” sez she, her dear blue eyes\r\nfillin’ up.\r\n\r\n‘“May be,” sez I. “Was he a friend av yours that saw ye home four times\r\nin the fortnight?”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes,” sez she, but her mouth was down at the corners. “An’--an’ what’s\r\nthat to you?” she sez.\r\n\r\n‘“Ask Dempsey,” sez I, purtendin’ to go away.\r\n\r\n‘“Did you fight for me then, ye silly man?” she sez, tho’ she knew ut\r\nall along.\r\n\r\n‘“Who else?” sez I, an’ I tuk wan pace to the front.\r\n\r\n‘“I wasn’t worth ut,” sez she, fingerin’ in her apron,\r\n\r\n‘“That’s for me to say,” sez I. “Shall I say ut?”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes,” sez she in a saint’s whisper, an’ at that I explained mesilf;\r\nand she tould me what ivry man that is a man, an’ many that is a woman,\r\nhears wanst in his life.\r\n\r\n‘“But what made ye cry at startin’, Dinah, darlin’?’” sez I.\r\n\r\n‘“Your--your bloody cheek,” sez she, duckin’ her little head down on my\r\nsash (I was on duty for the day) an’ whimperin’ like a sorrowful angil.\r\n\r\n‘Now a man cud take that two ways. I tuk ut as pleased me best an’ my\r\nfirst kiss wid ut. Mother av Innocence! but I kissed her on the tip\r\nav the nose an’ undher the eye; an’ a girl that let’s a kiss come\r\ntumble-ways like that has never been kissed before. Take note av that,\r\nsorr. Thin we wint hand in hand to ould Mother Shadd like two little\r\nchildher, an’ she said ‘twas no bad thing, an’ ould Shadd nodded behind\r\nhis pipe, an’ Dinah ran away to her own room. That day I throd on\r\nrollin’ clouds. All earth was too small to hould me. Begad, I cud ha’\r\nhiked the sun out av the sky for a live coal to my pipe, so magnificent\r\nI was. But I tuk recruities at squad-drill instid, an’ began wid general\r\nbattalion advance whin I shud ha’ been balance-steppin’ them. Eyah! that\r\nday! that day!’\r\n\r\nA very long pause. ‘Well?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘’Twas all wrong,’ said Mulvaney, with an enormous sigh. ‘An’ I know\r\nthat ev’ry bit av ut was my own foolishness. That night I tuk maybe the\r\nhalf av three pints--not enough to turn the hair of a man in his natural\r\nsenses. But I was more than half drunk wid pure joy, an’ that canteen\r\nbeer was so much whisky to me. I can’t tell how it came about, but\r\nBEKAZE I had no thought for anywan except Dinah, BEKAZE I hadn’t slipped\r\nher little white arms from my neck five minuts, BEKAZE the breath of her\r\nkiss was not gone from my mouth, I must go through the married lines\r\non my way to quarters an’ I must stay talkin’ to a red-headed Mullingar\r\nheifer av a girl, Judy Sheehy, that was daughter to Mother Sheehy, the\r\nwife of Nick Sheehy, the canteen-sergint--the Black Curse av Shielygh be\r\non the whole brood that are above groun’ this day!\r\n\r\n“‘An’ what are ye houldin’ your head that high for, corp’ril?” sez Judy.\r\n“Come in an’ thry a cup av tay,” she sez, standin’ in the doorway. Bein’\r\nan ontrustable fool, an’ thinkin’ av anything but tay, I wint.\r\n\r\n‘“Mother’s at canteen,” sez Judy, smoothin’ the hair av hers that was\r\nlike red snakes, an’ lookin’ at me cornerways out av her green cats’\r\neyes. “Ye will not mind, corp’ril?”\r\n\r\n‘“I can endure,” sez I; ould Mother Sheehy bein’ no divarsion av mine,\r\nnor her daughter too. Judy fetched the tea things an’ put thim on the\r\ntable, leanin’ over me very close to get thim square. I dhrew back,\r\nthinkin’ av Dinah.\r\n\r\n‘“Is ut afraid you are av a girl alone?” sez Judy.\r\n\r\n‘“No,” sez I. “Why should I be?”\r\n\r\n‘“That rests wid the girl,” sez Judy, dhrawin’ her chair next to mine.\r\n\r\n‘“Thin there let ut rest,” sez I; an’ thinkin’ I’d been a trifle\r\nonpolite, I sez, “The tay’s not quite sweet enough for my taste. Put\r\nyour little finger in the cup, Judy. ‘Twill make ut necthar.”\r\n\r\n‘“What’s necthar?” sez she.\r\n\r\n“‘Somethin’ very sweet,” sez I; an’ for the sinful life av me I cud not\r\nhelp lookin’ at her out av the corner av my eye, as I was used to look\r\nat a woman.\r\n\r\n‘“Go on wid ye, corp’ril,” sez she. “You’re a flirrt.”\r\n\r\n‘“On me sowl I’m not,” sez I.\r\n\r\n‘“Then you’re a cruel handsome man, an’ that’s worse,” sez she, heaving\r\nbig sighs an’ lookin’ crossways.\r\n\r\n‘“You know your own mind,” sez I.\r\n\r\n‘“‘Twud be better for me if I did not,” she sez.\r\n\r\n‘“There’s a dale to be said on both sides av that,” sez I, unthinkin’.\r\n\r\n‘“Say your own part av ut, then, Terence, darlin’,” sez she; “for begad\r\nI’m thinkin’ I’ve said too much or too little for an honest girl,” an’\r\nwid that she put her arms round my neck an’ kissed me.\r\n\r\n‘“There’s no more to be said afther that,” sez I, kissin’ her back\r\nagain--Oh the mane scutt that I was, my head ringin’ wid Dinah Shadd!\r\nHow does ut come about, sorr, that when a man has put the comether on\r\nwan woman, he’s sure bound to put it on another? ‘Tis the same thing at\r\nmusketry. Wan day ivry shot goes wide or into the bank, an’ the next,\r\nlay high lay low, sight or snap, ye can’t get off the bull’s-eye for ten\r\nshots runnin’.’\r\n\r\n‘That only happens to a man who has had a good deal of experience. He\r\ndoes it without thinking,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘Thankin’ you for the complimint, sorr, ut may be so. But I’m doubtful\r\nwhether you mint ut for a complimint. Hear now; I sat there wid Judy\r\non my knee tellin’ me all manner av nonsinse an’ only sayin’ “yes” an’\r\n“no,” when I’d much better ha’ kept tongue betune teeth. An’ that was\r\nnot an hour afther I had left Dinah! What I was thinkin’ av I\r\ncannot say. Presintly, quiet as a cat, ould Mother Sheehy came in\r\nvelvet-dhrunk. She had her daughter’s red hair, but ‘twas bald in\r\npatches, an’ I cud see in her wicked ould face, clear as lightnin’, what\r\nJudy wud be twenty years to come. I was for jumpin’ up, but Judy niver\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n‘“Terence has promust, mother,” sez she, an’ the could sweat bruk out\r\nall over me. Ould Mother Sheehy sat down of a heap an’ began playin’ wid\r\nthe cups. “Thin you’re a well-matched pair,” she sez very thick. “For\r\nhe’s the biggest rogue that iver spoiled the queen’s shoe-leather” an’--\r\n\r\n‘“I’m off, Judy,” sez I. “Ye should not talk nonsinse to your mother.\r\nGet her to bed, girl.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nonsinse!” sez the ould woman, prickin’ up her ears like a cat an’\r\ngrippin’ the table-edge. “‘Twill be the most nonsinsical nonsinse for\r\nyou, ye grinnin’ badger, if nonsinse ‘tis. Git clear, you. I’m goin’ to\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n‘I ran out into the dhark, my head in a stew an’ my heart sick, but I\r\nhad sinse enough to see that I’d brought ut all on mysilf. “It’s this to\r\npass the time av day to a panjandhrum av hell-cats,” sez I. “What I’ve\r\nsaid, an’ what I’ve not said do not matther. Judy an’ her dam will hould\r\nme for a promust man, an’ Dinah will give me the go, an’ I desarve ut. I\r\nwill go an’ get dhrunk,” sez I, “an’ forget about ut, for ‘tis plain I’m\r\nnot a marrin’ man.”\r\n\r\n‘On my way to canteen I ran against Lascelles, colour-sergint that was\r\nav E Comp’ny, a hard, hard man, wid a torment av a wife. “You’ve the\r\nhead av a drowned man on your shoulders,” sez he; “an’ you’re goin’\r\nwhere you’ll get a worse wan. Come back,” sez he. “Let me go,” sez I.\r\n“I’ve thrown my luck over the wall wid my own hand!”--“Then that’s not\r\nthe way to get ut back again,” sez he. “Have out wid your throuble, ye\r\nfool-bhoy.” An’ I tould him how the matther was.\r\n\r\n‘He sucked in his lower lip. “You’ve been thrapped,” sez he. “Ju Sheehy\r\nwud be the betther for a man’s name to hers as soon as can. An’ we\r\nthought ye’d put the comether on her,--that’s the natural vanity of the\r\nbaste, Terence, you’re a big born fool, but you’re not bad enough\r\nto marry into that comp’ny. If you said anythin’, an’ for all your\r\nprotestations I’m sure ye did--or did not, which is worse,--eat ut\r\nall--lie like the father of all lies, but come out av ut free av Judy.\r\nDo I not know what ut is to marry a woman that was the very spit\r\nan’ image av Judy whin she was young? I’m gettin’ old an’ I’ve larnt\r\npatience, but you, Terence, you’d raise hand on Judy an’ kill her in a\r\nyear. Never mind if Dinah gives you the go, you’ve desarved ut; never\r\nmind if the whole reg’mint laughs you all day. Get shut av Judy an’ her\r\nmother. They can’t dhrag you to church, but if they do, they’ll dhrag\r\nyou to hell. Go back to your quarters and lie down,” sez he. Thin over\r\nhis shoulder, “You MUST ha’ done with thim.”\r\n\r\n‘Next day I wint to see Dinah, but there was no tucker in me as I\r\nwalked. I knew the throuble wud come soon enough widout any handlin’ av\r\nmine, an’ I dreaded ut sore.\r\n\r\n‘I heard Judy callin’ me, but I hild straight on to the Shadds’\r\nquarthers, an’ Dinah wud ha’ kissed me but I put her back.\r\n\r\n‘“Whin all’s said, darlin’,” sez I, “you can give ut me if ye will, tho’\r\nI misdoubt ‘twill be so easy to come by then.”\r\n\r\n‘I had scarce begun to put the explanation into shape before Judy an’\r\nher mother came to the door. I think there was a verandah, but I’m\r\nforgettin’.\r\n\r\n‘“Will ye not step in?” sez Dinah, pretty and polite, though the Shadds\r\nhad no dealin’s with the Sheehys. Ould Mother Shadd looked up quick, an’\r\nshe was the fust to see the throuble; for Dinah was her daughter.\r\n\r\n‘“I’m pressed for time to-day,” sez Judy as bould as brass; “an’ I’ve\r\nonly come for Terence,--my promust man. ‘Tis strange to find him here\r\nthe day afther the day.”\r\n\r\n‘Dinah looked at me as though I had hit her, an’ I answered straight.\r\n\r\n‘“There was some nonsinse last night at the Sheehys’ quarthers, an’\r\nJudy’s carryin’ on the joke, darlin’,” sez I.\r\n\r\n‘“At the Sheehys’ quarthers?” sez Dinah very slow, an’ Judy cut in wid:\r\n“He was there from nine till ten, Dinah Shadd, an’ the betther half av\r\nthat time I was sittin’ on his knee, Dinah Shadd. Ye may look and ye may\r\nlook an’ ye may look me up an’ down, but ye won’t look away that Terence\r\nis my promust man. Terence, darlin’, ‘tis time for us to be comin’\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\n‘Dinah Shadd niver said word to Judy. “Ye left me at half-past\r\neight,” she sez to me, “an I niver thought that ye’d leave me for\r\nJudy,--promises or no promises. Go back wid her, you that have to be\r\nfetched by a girl! I’m done with you,” sez she, and she ran into her own\r\nroom, her mother followin’. So I was alone wid those two women and at\r\nliberty to spake my sentiments.\r\n\r\n‘“Judy Sheehy,” sez I, “if you made a fool av me betune the lights you\r\nshall not do ut in the day. I niver promised you words or lines.”\r\n\r\n‘“You lie,” sez ould Mother Sheehy, “an’ may ut choke you where you\r\nstand!” She was far gone in dhrink.\r\n\r\n‘“An’ tho’ ut choked me where I stud I’d not change,” sez I. “Go home,\r\nJudy. I take shame for a decent girl like you dhraggin’ your mother out\r\nbare-headed on this errand. Hear now, and have ut for an answer. I gave\r\nmy word to Dinah Shadd yesterday, an’, more blame to me, I was wid you\r\nlast night talkin’ nonsinse but nothin’ more. You’ve chosen to thry to\r\nhould me on ut. I will not be held thereby for anythin’ in the world. Is\r\nthat enough?”\r\n\r\n‘Judy wint pink all over. “An’ I wish you joy av the perjury,” sez she,\r\nduckin’ a curtsey. “You’ve lost a woman that would ha’ wore her hand to\r\nthe bone for your pleasure; an’ ‘deed, Terence, ye were not thrapped...”\r\n Lascelles must ha’ spoken plain to her. “I am such as Dinah is--‘deed\r\nI am! Ye’ve lost a fool av a girl that’ll niver look at you again, an’\r\nye’ve lost what he niver had,--your common honesty. If you manage your\r\nmen as you manage your love-makin’, small wondher they call you the\r\nworst corp’ril in the comp’ny. Come away, mother,” sez she.\r\n\r\n‘But divil a fut would the ould woman budge! “D’you hould by that?” sez\r\nshe, peerin’ up under her thick gray eyebrows.\r\n\r\n‘“Ay, an’ wud,” sez I, “tho’ Dinah give me the go twinty times. I’ll\r\nhave no thruck with you or yours,” sez I. “Take your child away, ye\r\nshameless woman.”\r\n\r\n“‘An’ am I shameless?” sez she, bringin’ her hands up above her head.\r\n“Thin what are you, ye lyin’, schamin’, weak-kneed, dhirty-souled son\r\nav a sutler? Am _I_ shameless? Who put the open shame on me an’ my child\r\nthat we shud go beggin’ through the lines in the broad daylight for\r\nthe broken word of a man? Double portion of my shame be on you, Terence\r\nMulvaney, that think yourself so strong! By Mary and the saints, by\r\nblood and water an’ by ivry sorrow that came into the world since the\r\nbeginnin’, the black blight fall on you and yours, so that you may niver\r\nbe free from pain for another when ut’s not your own! May your heart\r\nbleed in your breast drop by drop wid all your friends laughin’ at the\r\nbleedin’! Strong you think yourself? May your strength be a curse to you\r\nto dhrive you into the divil’s hands against your own will! Clear-eyed\r\nyou are? May your eyes see clear ivry step av the dark path you take\r\ntill the hot cindhers av hell put thim out! May the ragin’ dry thirst\r\nin my own ould bones go to you that you shall niver pass bottle full\r\nnor glass empty. God preserve the light av your onderstandin’ to you,\r\nmy jewel av a bhoy, that ye may niver forget what you mint to be an’ do,\r\nwhin you’re wallowin’ in the muck! May ye see the betther and follow the\r\nworse as long as there’s breath in your body; an’ may ye die quick in\r\na strange land, watchin’ your death before ut takes you, an’ enable to\r\nstir hand or foot!”\r\n\r\n‘I heard a scufflin’ in the room behind, and thin Dinah Shadd’s hand\r\ndhropped into mine like a rose-leaf into a muddy road.\r\n\r\n‘“The half av that I’ll take,” sez she, “an’ more too if I can. Go home,\r\nye silly talkin’ woman,--go home an’ confess.”\r\n\r\n‘“Come away! Come away!” sez Judy, pullin’ her mother by the shawl.\r\n“‘Twas none av Terence’s fault. For the love av Mary stop the talkin’!”\r\n\r\n“‘An’ you!” said ould Mother Sheehy, spinnin’ round forninst Dinah.\r\n“Will ye take the half av that man’s load? Stand off from him,\r\nDinah Shadd, before he takes you down too--you that look to be a\r\nquarther-master-sergeant’s wife in five years. You look too high, child.\r\nYou shall WASH for the quarther-master-sergeant, whin he plases to give\r\nyou the job out av charity; but a privit’s wife you shall be to the end,\r\nan’ ivry sorrow of a privit’s wife you shall know and niver a joy but\r\nwan, that shall go from you like the running tide from a rock. The pain\r\nav bearin’ you shall know but niver the pleasure av giving the breast;\r\nan’ you shall put away a man-child into the common ground wid niver a\r\npriest to say a prayer over him, an’ on that man-child ye shall think\r\nivry day av your life. Think long, Dinah Shadd, for you’ll niver have\r\nanother tho’ you pray till your knees are bleedin’. The mothers av\r\nchildher shall mock you behind your back when you’re wringing over the\r\nwash-tub. You shall know what ut is to help a dhrunken husband home an’\r\nsee him go to the gyard-room. Will that plase you, Dinah Shadd, that\r\nwon’t be seen talkin’ to my daughter? You shall talk to worse than\r\nJudy before all’s over. The sergints’ wives shall look down on you\r\ncontemptuous, daughter av a sergint, an’ you shall cover ut all up wid a\r\nsmiling face when your heart’s burstin’. Stand off av him, Dinah Shadd,\r\nfor I’ve put the Black Curse of Shielygh upon him an’ his own mouth\r\nshall make ut good.”\r\n\r\n‘She pitched forward on her head an’ began foamin’ at the mouth. Dinah\r\nShadd ran out wid water, an’ Judy dhragged the ould woman into the\r\nverandah till she sat up.\r\n\r\n‘“I’m old an’ forlore,” she sez, thremblin’ an’ cryin’, “and ‘tis like I\r\nsay a dale more than I mane.”\r\n\r\n‘“When you’re able to walk,--go,” says ould Mother Shadd. “This house\r\nhas no place for the likes av you that have cursed my daughter.”\r\n\r\n‘“Eyah!” said the ould woman. “Hard words break no bones, an’ Dinah\r\nShadd’ll kape the love av her husband till my bones are green corn. Judy\r\ndarlin’, I misremember what I came here for. Can you lend us the bottom\r\nav a taycup av tay, Mrs. Shadd?”\r\n\r\n‘But Judy dhragged her off cryin’ as tho’ her heart wud break. An’ Dinah\r\nShadd an’ I, in ten minutes we had forgot ut all.’\r\n\r\n‘Then why do you remember it now?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘Is ut like I’d forget? Ivry word that wicked ould woman spoke fell\r\nthrue in my life aftherwards, an’ I cud ha’ stud ut all--stud ut\r\nall--excipt when my little Shadd was born. That was on the line av march\r\nthree months afther the regiment was taken with cholera. We were betune\r\nUmballa an’ Kalka thin, an’ I was on picket. Whin I came off duty the\r\nwomen showed me the child, an’ ut turned on uts side an’ died as I\r\nlooked. We buried him by the road, an’ Father Victor was a day’s march\r\nbehind wid the heavy baggage, so the comp’ny captain read a prayer.\r\nAn’ since then I’ve been a childless man, an’ all else that ould Mother\r\nSheehy put upon me an’ Dinah Shadd. What do you think, sorr?’\r\n\r\nI thought a good deal, but it seemed better then to reach out for\r\nMulvaney’s hand. The demonstration nearly cost me the use of three\r\nfingers. Whatever he knows of his weaknesses, Mulvaney is entirely\r\nignorant of his strength.\r\n\r\n‘But what do you think?’ he repeated, as I was straightening out the\r\ncrushed fingers.\r\n\r\nMy reply was drowned in yells and outcries from the next fire, where\r\nten men were shouting for ‘Orth’ris,’ ‘Privit Orth’ris,’ ‘Mistah\r\nOr--ther--ris!’ ‘Deah boy,’ ‘Cap’n Orth’ris,’ ‘Field-Marshal Orth’ris,’\r\n‘Stanley, you pen’north o’ pop, come ‘ere to your own comp’ny!’ And the\r\ncockney, who had been delighting another audience with recondite and\r\nRabelaisian yarns, was shot down among his admirers by the major force.\r\n\r\n‘You’ve crumpled my dress-shirt ‘orrid,’ said he, ‘an’ I shan’t sing no\r\nmore to this ‘ere bloomin’ drawin’-room.’\r\n\r\nLearoyd, roused by the confusion, uncoiled himself, crept behind\r\nOrtheris, and slung him aloft on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n‘Sing, ye bloomin’ hummin’ bird!’ said he, and Ortheris, beating time\r\non Learoyd’s skull, delivered himself, in the raucous voice of the\r\nRatcliffe Highway, of this song:--\r\n\r\n    My girl she give me the go onst,\r\n      When I was a London lad,\r\n    An’ I went on the drink for a fortnight,\r\n      An’ then I went to the bad.\r\n    The Queen she give me a shillin’\r\n      To fight for ‘er over the seas;\r\n    But Guv’ment built me a fever-trap,\r\n      An’ Injia give me disease.\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\n    Ho! don’t you ‘eed what a girl says,\r\n      An’ don’t you go for the beer;\r\n    But I was an ass when I was at grass,\r\n      An’ that is why I’m ‘ere.\r\n\r\n   I fired a shot at a Afghan,\r\n      The beggar ‘e fired again,\r\n    An’ I lay on my bed with a ‘ole in my ‘ed;\r\n      An’ missed the next campaign!\r\n    I up with my gun at a Burman\r\n      Who carried a bloomin’ dah,\r\n    But the cartridge stuck and the bay’nit bruk,\r\n      An’ all I got was the scar.\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\n    Ho! don’t you aim at a Afghan\r\n       When you stand on the sky-line clear;\r\n    An’ don’t you go for a Burman\r\n      If none o’ your friends is near.\r\n\r\n    I served my time for a corp’ral,\r\n      An’ wetted my stripes with pop,\r\n    For I went on the bend with a intimate friend,\r\n      An’ finished the night in the ‘shop.’\r\n    I served my time for a sergeant;\r\n      The colonel ‘e sez ‘No!\r\n    The most you’ll see is a full C. B.’\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Confined to barracks.]\r\n      An’...very next night ‘twas so.\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\n    Ho! don’t you go for a corp’ral\r\n      Unless your ‘ed is clear;\r\n    But I was an ass when I was at grass,\r\n      An’ that is why I’m ‘ere.\r\n\r\n    I’ve tasted the luck o’ the army\r\n      In barrack an’ camp an’ clink,\r\n    An’ I lost my tip through the bloomin’ trip\r\n      Along o’ the women an’ drink.\r\n    I’m down at the heel o’ my service\r\n      An’ when I am laid on the shelf,\r\n    My very wust friend from beginning to end\r\n      By the blood of a mouse was myself!\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\n    Ho! don’t you ‘eed what a girl says,\r\n      An’ don’t you go for the beer;\r\n    But I was an ass when I was at grass,\r\n      An’ that is why I’m ‘ere.\r\n\r\n‘Ay, listen to our little man now, singin’ an’ shoutin’ as tho’\r\ntrouble had niver touched him. D’you remember when he went mad with the\r\nhome-sickness?’ said Mulvaney, recalling a never-to-be-forgotten season\r\nwhen Ortheris waded through the deep waters of affliction and behaved\r\nabominably. ‘But he’s talkin’ bitter truth, though. Eyah!\r\n\r\n   ‘My very worst frind from beginnin’ to ind\r\n    By the blood av a mouse was mesilf!’\r\n\r\nWhen I woke I saw Mulvaney, the night-dew gemming his moustache, leaning\r\non his rifle at picket, lonely as Prometheus on his rock, with I know\r\nnot what vultures tearing his liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON GREENHOW HILL\r\n\r\n\r\n To Love’s low voice she lent a careless ear;\r\n Her hand within his rosy fingers lay,\r\n A chilling weight. She would not turn or hear;\r\n But with averted face went on her way.\r\n But when pale Death, all featureless and grim,\r\n Lifted his bony hand, and beckoning\r\n Held out his cypress-wreath, she followed him,\r\n And Love was left forlorn and wondering,\r\n That she who for his bidding would not stay,\r\n At Death’s first whisper rose and went away.\r\n                                 RIVALS.\r\n\r\n‘Ohe, Ahmed Din! Shafiz Ullah ahoo! Bahadur Khan, where are you? Come\r\nout of the tents, as I have done, and fight against the English. Don’t\r\nkill your own kin! Come out to me!’\r\n\r\nThe deserter from a native corps was crawling round the outskirts of the\r\ncamp, firing at intervals, and shouting invitations to his old comrades.\r\nMisled by the rain and the darkness, he came to the English wing of the\r\ncamp, and with his yelping and rifle-practice disturbed the men. They\r\nhad been making roads all day, and were tired.\r\n\r\nOrtheris was sleeping at Learoyd’s feet. ‘Wot’s all that?’ he said\r\nthickly. Learoyd snored, and a Snider bullet ripped its way through\r\nthe tent wall. The men swore. ‘It’s that bloomin’ deserter from the\r\nAurangabadis,’ said Ortheris. ‘Git up, some one, an’ tell ‘im ‘e’s come\r\nto the wrong shop.’\r\n\r\n‘Go to sleep, little man,’ said Mulvaney, who was steaming nearest the\r\ndoor. ‘I can’t arise an’ expaytiate with him. ‘Tis rainin’ entrenchin’\r\ntools outside.’\r\n\r\n‘’Tain’t because you bloomin’ can’t. It’s ‘cause you bloomin’ won’t, ye\r\nlong, limp, lousy, lazy beggar, you. ‘Ark to’im ‘owlin’!’\r\n\r\n‘Wot’s the good of argifying? Put a bullet into the swine! ‘E’s keepin’\r\nus awake!’ said another voice.\r\n\r\nA subaltern shouted angrily, and a dripping sentry whined from the\r\ndarkness--\r\n\r\n‘’Tain’t no good, sir. I can’t see ‘im. ‘E’s ‘idin’ somewhere down\r\n‘ill.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris tumbled out of his blanket. ‘Shall I try to get ‘im, sir?’ said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n‘No,’ was the answer. ‘Lie down. I won’t have the whole camp shooting\r\nall round the clock. Tell him to go and pot his friends.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris considered for a moment. Then, putting his head under the\r\ntent wall, he called, as a ‘bus conductor calls in a block, ‘’Igher up,\r\nthere! ‘Igher up!’\r\n\r\nThe men laughed, and the laughter was carried down wind to the deserter,\r\nwho, hearing that he had made a mistake, went off to worry his own\r\nregiment half a mile away. He was received with shots; the Aurangabadis\r\nwere very angry with him for disgracing their colours.\r\n\r\n‘An’ that’s all right,’ said Ortheris, withdrawing his head as he heard\r\nthe hiccough of the Sniders in the distance. ‘S’elp me Gawd, tho’, that\r\nman’s not fit to live--messin’ with my beauty-sleep this way.’\r\n\r\n‘Go out and shoot him in the morning, then,’ said the subaltern\r\nincautiously. ‘Silence in the tents now. Get your rest, men.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris lay down with a happy little sigh, and in two minutes there\r\nwas no sound except the rain on the canvas and the all-embracing and\r\nelemental snoring of Learoyd.\r\n\r\nThe camp lay on a bare ridge of the Himalayas, and for a week had been\r\nwaiting for a flying column to make connection. The nightly rounds of\r\nthe deserter and his friends had become a nuisance.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the men dried themselves in hot sunshine and cleaned\r\ntheir grimy accoutrements. The native regiment was to take its turn of\r\nroad-making that day while the Old Regiment loafed.\r\n\r\n‘I’m goin’ to lay for a shot at that man,’ said Ortheris, when he had\r\nfinished washing out his rifle. ‘’E comes up the watercourse every\r\nevenin’ about five o’clock. If we go and lie out on the north ‘ill a bit\r\nthis afternoon we’ll get ‘im.’\r\n\r\n‘You’re a bloodthirsty little mosquito,’ said Mulvaney, blowing blue\r\nclouds into the air. ‘But I suppose I will have to come wid you.\r\nFwhere’s Jock?’\r\n\r\n‘Gone out with the Mixed Pickles, ‘cause ‘e thinks ‘isself a bloomin’\r\nmarksman,’ said Ortheris with scorn.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Mixed Pickles’ were a detachment of picked shots, generally\r\nemployed in clearing spurs of hills when the enemy were too impertinent.\r\nThis taught the young officers how to handle men, and did not do the\r\nenemy much harm. Mulvaney and Ortheris strolled out of camp, and passed\r\nthe Aurangabadis going to their road-making.\r\n\r\n‘You’ve got to sweat to-day,’ said Ortheris genially. ‘We’re going to\r\nget your man. You didn’t knock ‘im out last night by any chance, any of\r\nyou?’\r\n\r\n‘No. The pig went away mocking us. I had one shot at him,’ said a\r\nprivate. ‘He’s my cousin, and _I_ ought to have cleared our dishonour.\r\nBut good luck to you.’\r\n\r\nThey went cautiously to the north hill, Ortheris leading, because, as he\r\nexplained, ‘this is a long-range show, an’ I’ve got to do it.’ His was an\r\nalmost passionate devotion to his rifle, which, by barrack-room report,\r\nhe was supposed to kiss every night before turning in. Charges and\r\nscuffles he held in contempt, and, when they were inevitable, slipped\r\nbetween Mulvaney and Learoyd, bidding them to fight for his skin as well\r\nas their own. They never failed him. He trotted along, questing like a\r\nhound on a broken trail, through the wood of the north hill. At last\r\nhe was satisfied, and threw himself down on the soft pine-needled\r\nslope that commanded a clear view of the watercourse and a brown, bare\r\nhillside beyond it. The trees made a scented darkness in which an army\r\ncorps could have hidden from the sun-glare without.\r\n\r\n‘’Ere’s the tail o’ the wood,’ said Ortheris. ‘’E’s got to come up the\r\nwatercourse, ‘cause it gives ‘im cover. We’ll lay ‘ere. ‘Tain’t not arf\r\nso bloomin’ dusty neither.’\r\n\r\nHe buried his nose in a clump of scentless white violets. No one had\r\ncome to tell the flowers that the season of their strength was long\r\npast, and they had bloomed merrily in the twilight of the pines.\r\n\r\n‘This is something like,’ he said luxuriously. ‘Wot a ‘evinly clear drop\r\nfor a bullet acrost! How much d’you make it, Mulvaney?’\r\n\r\n‘Seven hunder. Maybe a trifle less, bekaze the air’s so thin.’\r\n\r\nWOP! WOP! WOP! went a volley of musketry on the rear face of the north\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n‘Curse them Mixed Pickles firin’ at nothin’! They’ll scare arf the\r\ncountry.’\r\n\r\n‘Thry a sightin’ shot in the middle of the row,’ said Mulvaney, the man\r\nof many wiles. ‘There’s a red rock yonder he’ll be sure to pass. Quick!’\r\n\r\nOrtheris ran his sight up to six hundred yards and fired. The bullet\r\nthrew up a feather of dust by a clump of gentians at the base of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n‘Good enough!’ said Ortheris, snapping the scale down. ‘You snick\r\nyour sights to mine or a little lower. You’re always firin’ high. But\r\nremember, first shot to me. O Lordy! but it’s a lovely afternoon.’\r\n\r\nThe noise of the firing grew louder, and there was a tramping of men in\r\nthe wood. The two lay very quiet, for they knew that the British soldier\r\nis desperately prone to fire at anything that moves or calls. Then\r\nLearoyd appeared, his tunic ripped across the breast by a bullet,\r\nlooking ashamed of himself. He flung down on the pine-needles, breathing\r\nin snorts.\r\n\r\n‘One o’ them damned gardeners o’ th’ Pickles,’ said he, fingering the\r\nrent. ‘Firin’ to th’ right flank, when he knowed I was there. If I knew\r\nwho he was I’d ‘a’ rippen the hide offan him. Look at ma tunic!’\r\n\r\n‘That’s the spishil trustability av a marksman. Train him to hit a fly\r\nwid a stiddy rest at seven hunder, an’ he loose on anythin’ he sees or\r\nhears up to th’ mile. You’re well out av that fancy-firin’ gang, Jock.\r\nStay here.’\r\n\r\n‘Bin firin’ at the bloomin’ wind in the bloomin’ tree-tops,’ said\r\nOrtheris with a chuckle. ‘I’ll show you some firin’ later on.’\r\n\r\nThey wallowed in the pine-needles, and the sun warmed them where they\r\nlay. The Mixed Pickles ceased firing, and returned to camp, and left the\r\nwood to a few scared apes. The watercourse lifted up its voice in the\r\nsilence, and talked foolishly to the rocks. Now and again the dull thump\r\nof a blasting charge three miles away told that the Aurangabadis were in\r\ndifficulties with their road-making. The men smiled as they listened and\r\nlay still, soaking in the warm leisure. Presently Learoyd, between the\r\nwhiffs of his pipe--\r\n\r\n‘Seems queer--about ‘im yonder--desertin’ at all.’\r\n\r\n‘’E’ll be a bloomin’ side queerer when I’ve done with ‘im,’ said\r\nOrtheris. They were talking in whispers, for the stillness of the wood\r\nand the desire of slaughter lay heavy upon them.\r\n\r\n‘I make no doubt he had his reasons for desertin’; but, my faith! I make\r\nless doubt ivry man has good reason for killin’ him,’ said Mulvaney.\r\n\r\n‘Happen there was a lass tewed up wi’ it. Men do more than more for th’\r\nsake of a lass.’\r\n\r\n‘They make most av us ‘list. They’ve no manner av right to make us\r\ndesert.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah; they make us ‘list, or their fathers do,’ said Learoyd softly,\r\nhis helmet over his eyes. Ortheris’s brows contracted savagely. He was\r\nwatching the valley. ‘If it’s a girl I’ll shoot the beggar twice over,\r\nan’ second time for bein’ a fool. You’re blasted sentimental all of a\r\nsudden. Thinkin’ o’ your last near shave?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, lad; ah was but thinkin’ o’ what had happened.’\r\n\r\n‘An’ fwhat has happened, ye lumberin’ child av calamity, that you’re\r\nlowing like a cow-calf at the back av the pasture, an’ suggestin’\r\ninvidious excuses for the man Stanley’s goin’ to kill. Ye’ll have to\r\nwait another hour yet, little man. Spit it out, Jock, an’ bellow melojus\r\nto the moon. It takes an earthquake or a bullet graze to fetch aught out\r\nav you. Discourse, Don Juan! The a-moors av Lotharius Learoyd! Stanley,\r\nkape a rowlin’ rig’mental eye on the valley.’\r\n\r\n‘It’s along o’ yon hill there,’ said Learoyd, watching the bare\r\nsub-Himalayan spur that reminded him of his Yorkshire moors. He was\r\nspeaking more to himself than his fellows. ‘Ay,’ said he, ‘Rumbolds Moor\r\nstands up ower Skipton town, an’ Greenhow Hill stands up ower Pately\r\nBrig. I reckon you’ve never heeard tell o’ Greenhow Hill, but you bit\r\no’ bare stuff if there was nobbut a white road windin’ is like ut;\r\nstrangely like. Moors an’ moors an’ moors, wi’ never a tree for shelter,\r\nan’ gray houses wi’ flagstone rooves, and pewits cryin’, an’ a windhover\r\ngoin’ to and fro just like these kites. And cold! A wind that cuts you\r\nlike a knife. You could tell Greenhow Hill folk by the red-apple\r\ncolour o’ their cheeks an’ nose tips, and their blue eyes, driven\r\ninto pinpoints by the wind. Miners mostly, burrowin’ for lead i’ th’\r\nhillsides, followin’ the trail of th’ ore vein same as a field-rat. It\r\nwas the roughest minin’ I ever seen. Yo’d come on a bit o’ creakin’ wood\r\nwindlass like a well-head, an’ you was let down i’ th’ bight of a rope,\r\nfendin’ yoursen off the side wi’ one hand, carryin’ a candle stuck in\r\na lump o’ clay with t’other, an’ clickin’ hold of a rope with t’other\r\nhand.’\r\n\r\n‘An’ that’s three of them,’ said Mulvaney. ‘Must be a good climate in\r\nthose parts.’\r\n\r\nLearoyd took no heed.\r\n\r\n‘An’ then yo’ came to a level, where you crept on your hands and knees\r\nthrough a mile o’ windin’ drift, an’ you come out into a cave-place as\r\nbig as Leeds Townhall, with a engine pumpin’ water from workin’s ‘at\r\nwent deeper still. It’s a queer country, let alone minin’, for the hill\r\nis full of those natural caves, an’ the rivers an’ the becks drops into\r\nwhat they call pot-holes, an’ come out again miles away.’\r\n\r\n‘Wot was you doin’ there?’ said Ortheris.\r\n\r\n‘I was a young chap then, an’ mostly went wi’ ‘osses, leadin’ coal and\r\nlead ore; but at th’ time I’m tellin’ on I was drivin’ the waggon-team\r\ni’ th’ big sumph. I didn’t belong to that country-side by rights. I went\r\nthere because of a little difference at home, an’ at fust I took up wi’\r\na rough lot. One night we’d been drinkin’, an’ I must ha’ hed more than\r\nI could stand, or happen th’ ale was none so good. Though i’ them days,\r\nBy for God, I never seed bad ale.’ He flung his arms over his head, and\r\ngripped a vast handful of white violets. ‘Nah,’ said he, ‘I never seed\r\nthe ale I could not drink, the bacca I could not smoke, nor the lass I\r\ncould not kiss. Well, we mun have a race home, the lot on us. I lost\r\nall th’ others, an’ when I was climbin’ ower one of them walls built o’\r\nloose stones, I comes down into the ditch, stones and all, an’ broke my\r\narm. Not as I knawed much about it, for I fell on th’ back of my head,\r\nan’ was knocked stupid like. An’ when I come to mysen it were mornin’,\r\nan’ I were lyin’ on the settle i’ Jesse Roantree’s houseplace, an’ ‘Liza\r\nRoantree was settin’ sewin’, I ached all ovver, and my mouth were like\r\na lime-kiln. She gave me a drink out of a china mug wi’ gold letters--“A\r\nPresent from Leeds”--as I looked at many and many a time at after.\r\n“Yo’re to lie still while Dr. Warbottom comes, because your arm’s\r\nbroken, and father has sent a lad to fetch him. He found yo’ when he was\r\ngoin’ to work, an’ carried you here on his back,” sez she. “Oa!” sez I;\r\nan’ I shet my eyes, for I felt ashamed o’ mysen. “Father’s gone to his\r\nwork these three hours, an’ he said he’d tell ‘em to get somebody to\r\ndrive the tram.” The clock ticked, an’ a bee comed in the house, an’\r\nthey rung i’ my head like mill-wheels. An’ she give me another drink\r\nan’ settled the pillow. “Eh, but yo’re young to be getten drunk an’ such\r\nlike, but yo’ won’t do it again, will yo’?”--“Noa,” sez I, “I wouldn’t\r\nif she’d not but stop they mill-wheels clatterin’.”’\r\n\r\n‘Faith, it’s a good thing to be nursed by a woman when you’re sick!’\r\nsaid Mulvaney. ‘Dir’ cheap at the price av twenty broken heads.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris turned to frown across the valley. He had not been nursed by\r\nmany women in his life.\r\n\r\n‘An’ then Dr. Warbottom comes ridin’ up, an’ Jesse Roantree along with\r\n‘im. He was a high-larned doctor, but he talked wi’ poor folk same as\r\ntheirsens. “What’s ta big agaate on naa?” he sings out. “Brekkin’ tha\r\nthick head?” An’ he felt me all ovver. “That’s none broken. Tha’ nobbut\r\nknocked a bit sillier than ordinary, an’ that’s daaft eneaf.” An’ soa he\r\nwent on, callin’ me all the names he could think on, but settin’ my arm,\r\nwi’ Jesse’s help, as careful as could be. “Yo’ mun let the big oaf bide\r\nhere a bit, Jesse,” he says, when he hed strapped me up an’ given me a\r\ndose o’ physic; “an’ you an’ Liza will tend him, though he’s scarcelins\r\nworth the trouble. An’ tha’ll lose tha work,” sez he, “an’ tha’ll be\r\nupon th’ Sick Club for a couple o’ months an’ more. Doesn’t tha think\r\ntha’s a fool?”’\r\n\r\n‘But whin was a young man, high or low, the other av a fool, I’d like\r\nto know?’ said Mulvaney. ‘Sure, folly’s the only safe way to wisdom, for\r\nI’ve thried it.’\r\n\r\n‘Wisdom!’ grinned Ortheris, scanning his comrades with uplifted chin.\r\n‘You’re bloomin’ Solomons, you two, ain’t you?’\r\n\r\nLearoyd went calmly on, with a steady eye like an ox chewing the cud.\r\n\r\n‘And that was how I come to know ‘Liza Roantree. There’s some tunes as\r\nshe used to sing--aw, she were always singin’--that fetches Greenhow\r\nHill before my eyes as fair as yon brow across there. And she would\r\nlearn me to sing bass, an’ I was to go to th’ chapel wi’ ‘em where\r\nJesse and she led the singin’, th’ old man playin’ the fiddle. He was a\r\nstrange chap, old Jesse, fair mad wi’ music, an’ he made me promise to\r\nlearn the big fiddle when my arm was better. It belonged to him, and\r\nit stood up in a big case alongside o’ th’ eight-day clock, but\r\nWillie Satterthwaite, as played it in the chapel, had getten deaf as a\r\ndoor-post, and it vexed Jesse, as he had to rap him ower his head wi’\r\nth’ fiddle-stick to make him give ower sawin’ at th’ right time.\r\n\r\n‘But there was a black drop in it all, an’ it was a man in a black coat\r\nthat brought it. When th’ Primitive Methodist preacher came to Greenhow,\r\nhe would always stop wi’ Jesse Roantree, an’ he laid hold of me from th’\r\nbeginning. It seemed I wor a soul to be saved, and he meaned to do it.\r\nAt th’ same time I jealoused ‘at he were keen o’ savin’ ‘Liza Roantree’s\r\nsoul as well, and I could ha’ killed him many a time. An’ this went on\r\ntill one day I broke out, an’ borrowed th’ brass for a drink from ‘Liza.\r\nAfter fower days I come back, wi’ my tail between my legs, just to see\r\n‘Liza again. But Jesse were at home an’ th’ preacher--th’ Reverend Amos\r\nBarraclough. ‘Liza said naught, but a bit o’ red come into her face as\r\nwere white of a regular thing. Says Jesse, tryin’ his best to be civil,\r\n“Nay, lad, it’s like this. You’ve getten to choose which way it’s\r\ngoin’ to be. I’ll ha’ nobody across ma doorstep as goes a-drinkin’,\r\nan’ borrows my lass’s money to spend i’ their drink. Ho’d tha tongue,\r\n‘Liza,” sez he, when she wanted to put in a word ‘at I were welcome to\r\nth’ brass, and she were none afraid that I wouldn’t pay it back. Then\r\nthe Reverend cuts in, seein’ as Jesse were losin’ his temper, an’ they\r\nfair beat me among them. But it were ‘Liza, as looked an’ said naught,\r\nas did more than either o’ their tongues, an’ soa I concluded to get\r\nconverted.’\r\n\r\n‘Fwhat?’ shouted Mulvaney. Then, checking himself, he said softly, ‘Let\r\nbe! Let be! Sure the Blessed Virgin is the mother of all religion an’\r\nmost women; an’ there’s a dale av piety in a girl if the men would\r\nonly let ut stay there. I’d ha’ been converted myself under the\r\ncircumstances.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, but,’ pursued Learoyd with a blush, ‘I meaned it.’\r\n\r\nOrtheris laughed as loudly as he dared, having regard to his business at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n‘Ay, Ortheris, you may laugh, but you didn’t know yon preacher\r\nBarraclough--a little white-faced chap, wi’ a voice as ‘ud wile a bird\r\noff an a bush, and a way o’ layin’ hold of folks as made them think\r\nthey’d never had a live man for a friend before. You never saw him,\r\nan’--an’--you never seed ‘Liza Roantree--never seed ‘Liza Roantree....\r\nHappen it was as much ‘Liza as th’ preacher and her father, but anyways\r\nthey all meaned it, an’ I was fair shamed o’ mysen, an’ so I become what\r\nthey call a changed character. And when I think on, it’s hard to believe\r\nas yon chap going to prayer-meetin’s, chapel, and class-meetin’s were\r\nme. But I never had naught to say for mysen, though there was a deal o’\r\nshoutin’, and old Sammy Strother, as were almost clemmed to death and\r\ndoubled up with the rheumatics, would sing out, “Joyful! Joyful!” and\r\n‘at it were better to go up to heaven in a coal-basket than down to hell\r\ni’ a coach an’ six. And he would put his poor old claw on my shoulder,\r\nsayin’, “Doesn’t tha feel it, tha great lump? Doesn’t tha feel it?” An’\r\nsometimes I thought I did, and then again I thought I didn’t, an’ how\r\nwas that?’\r\n\r\n‘The iverlastin’ nature av mankind,’ said Mulvaney. ‘An’, furthermore,\r\nI misdoubt you were built for the Primitive Methodians. They’re a new\r\ncorps anyways. I hold by the Ould Church, for she’s the mother of them\r\nall--ay, an’ the father, too. I like her bekaze she’s most remarkable\r\nregimental in her fittings. I may die in Honolulu, Nova Zambra, or Cape\r\nCayenne, but wherever I die, me bein’ fwhat I am, an’ a priest handy, I\r\ngo under the same orders an’ the same words an’ the same unction as tho’\r\nthe Pope himself come down from the roof av St. Peter’s to see me\r\noff. There’s neither high nor low, nor broad nor deep, nor betwixt nor\r\nbetween wid her, an’ that’s what I like. But mark you, she’s no manner\r\nav Church for a wake man, bekaze she takes the body and the soul av him,\r\nonless he has his proper work to do. I remember when my father died that\r\nwas three months comin’ to his grave; begad he’d ha’ sold the shebeen\r\nabove our heads for ten minutes’ quittance of purgathory. An’ he did all\r\nhe could. That’s why I say ut takes a strong man to deal with the Ould\r\nChurch, an’ for that reason you’ll find so many women go there. An’ that\r\nsame’s a conundrum.’\r\n\r\n‘Wot’s the use o’ worritin’ ‘bout these things?’ said Ortheris. ‘You’re\r\nbound to find all out quicker nor you want to, any’ow.’ He jerked the\r\ncartridge out of the breech-block into the palm of his hand. ‘’Ere’s my\r\nchaplain,’ he said, and made the venomous black-headed bullet bow like\r\na marionette. ‘’E’s goin’ to teach a man all about which is which, an’\r\nwot’s true, after all, before sundown. But wot ‘appened after that,\r\nJock?’\r\n\r\n‘There was one thing they boggled at, and almost shut th’ gate i’ my\r\nface for, and that were my dog Blast, th’ only one saved out o’ a litter\r\no’ pups as was blowed up when a keg o’ minin’ powder loosed off in th’\r\nstore-keeper’s hut. They liked his name no better than his business,\r\nwhich were fightin’ every dog he comed across; a rare good dog, wi’\r\nspots o’ black and pink on his face, one ear gone, and lame o’ one side\r\nwi’ being driven in a basket through an iron roof, a matter of half a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\n‘They said I mun give him up ‘cause he were worldly and low; and would\r\nI let mysen be shut out of heaven for the sake on a dog? “Nay,” says I,\r\n“if th’ door isn’t wide enough for th’ pair on us, we’ll stop outside,\r\nfor we’ll none be parted.” And th’ preacher spoke up for Blast, as had a\r\nlikin’ for him from th’ first--I reckon that was why I come to like th’\r\npreacher--and wouldn’t hear o’ changin’ his name to Bless, as some o’\r\nthem wanted. So th’ pair on us became reg’lar chapel-members. But it’s\r\nhard for a young chap o’ my build to cut traces from the world, th’\r\nflesh, an’ the devil all uv a heap. Yet I stuck to it for a long time,\r\nwhile th’ lads as used to stand about th’ town-end an’ lean ower th’\r\nbridge, spittin’ into th’ beck o’ a Sunday, would call after me,\r\n“Sitha, Learoyd, when’s ta bean to preach, ‘cause we’re comin’ to hear\r\ntha.”--“Ho’d tha jaw. He hasn’t getten th’ white choaker on ta morn,”\r\n another lad would say, and I had to double my fists hard i’ th’ bottom\r\nof my Sunday coat, and say to mysen, “If ‘twere Monday and I warn’t a\r\nmember o’ the Primitive Methodists, I’d leather all th’ lot of yond’.”\r\n That was th’ hardest of all--to know that I could fight and I mustn’t\r\nfight.’\r\n\r\nSympathetic grunts from Mulvaney.\r\n\r\n‘So what wi’ singin’, practising and class-meetin’s, and th’ big fiddle,\r\nas he made me take between my knees, I spent a deal o’ time i’ Jesse\r\nRoantree’s house-place. But often as I was there, th’ preacher fared to\r\nme to go oftener, and both th’ old man an’ th’ young woman were pleased\r\nto have him. He lived i’ Pately Brig, as were a goodish step off, but he\r\ncome. He come all the same. I liked him as well or better as any man I’d\r\never seen i’ one way, and yet I hated him wi’ all my heart i’ t’other,\r\nand we watched each other like cat and mouse, but civil as you please,\r\nfor I was on my best behaviour, and he was that fair and open that I was\r\nbound to be fair with him. Rare good company he was, if I hadn’t wanted\r\nto wring his cliver little neck half of the time. Often and often when\r\nhe was goin’ from Jesse’s I’d set him a bit on the road.’\r\n\r\n‘See ‘im ‘ome, you mean?’ said Ortheris.\r\n\r\n‘Ay. It’s a way we have i’ Yorkshire o’ seein’ friends off. You was a\r\nfriend as I didn’t want to come back, and he didn’t want me to come back\r\nneither, and so we’d walk together towards Pately, and then he’d set\r\nme back again, and there we’d be wal two o’clock i’ the mornin’ settin’\r\neach other to an’ fro like a blasted pair o’ pendulums twixt hill and\r\nvalley, long after th’ light had gone out i’ ‘Liza’s window, as both on\r\nus had been looking at, pretending to watch the moon.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!’ broke in Mulvaney, ‘ye’d no chanst against the maraudin’\r\npsalm-singer. They’ll take the airs an’ the graces instid av the\r\nman nine times out av ten, an’ they only find the blunder later--the\r\nwimmen.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s just where yo’re wrong,’ said Learoyd, reddening under the\r\nfreckled tan of his cheeks. ‘I was th’ first wi’ ‘Liza, an’ yo’d think\r\nthat were enough. But th’ parson were a steady-gaited sort o’ chap, and\r\nJesse were strong o’ his side, and all th’ women i’ the congregation\r\ndinned it to ‘Liza ‘at she were fair fond to take up wi’ a wastrel\r\nne’er-do-weel like me, as was scarcelins respectable an’ a fighting\r\ndog at his heels. It was all very well for her to be doing me good and\r\nsaving my soul, but she must mind as she didn’t do herself harm. They\r\ntalk o’ rich folk bein’ stuck up an’ genteel, but for cast-iron pride o’\r\nrespectability there’s naught like poor chapel folk. It’s as cold as th’\r\nwind o’ Greenhow Hill--ay, and colder, for ‘twill never change. And\r\nnow I come to think on it, one at strangest things I know is ‘at they\r\ncouldn’t abide th’ thought o’ soldiering. There’s a vast o’ fightin’\r\ni’ th’ Bible, and there’s a deal of Methodists i’ th’ army; but to hear\r\nchapel folk talk yo’d think that soldierin’ were next door, an’ t’other\r\nside, to hangin’. I’ their meetin’s all their talk is o’ fightin’. When\r\nSammy Strother were stuck for summat to say in his prayers, he’d sing\r\nout, “Th’ sword o’ th’ Lord and o’ Gideon.” They were allus at it about\r\nputtin’ on th’ whole armour o’ righteousness, an’ fightin’ the good\r\nfight o’ faith. And then, atop o’ ‘t all, they held a prayer-meetin’\r\nower a young chap as wanted to ‘list, and nearly deafened him, till\r\nhe picked up his hat and fair ran away. And they’d tell tales in\r\nth’ Sunday-school o’ bad lads as had been thumped and brayed for\r\nbird-nesting o’ Sundays and playin’ truant o’ week-days, and how they\r\ntook to wrestlin’, dog-fightin’, rabbit-runnin’, and drinkin’, till at\r\nlast, as if ‘twere a hepitaph on a gravestone, they damned him across\r\nth’ moors wi’, “an’ then he went and ‘listed for a soldier,” an’ they’d\r\nall fetch a deep breath, and throw up their eyes like a hen drinkin’.’\r\n\r\n‘Fwhy is ut?’ said Mulvaney, bringing down his hand on his thigh with a\r\ncrack.’ In the name av God, fwhy is ut? I’ve seen ut, tu. They cheat an’\r\nthey swindle an’ they lie an’ they slander, an’ fifty things fifty times\r\nworse; but the last an’ the worst by their reckonin’ is to serve the\r\nWiddy honest. It’s like the talk av childher--seein’ things all round.’\r\n\r\n‘Plucky lot of fightin’ good fights of whatsername they’d do if we\r\ndidn’t see they had a quiet place to fight in. And such fightin’ as\r\ntheirs is! Cats on the tiles. T’other callin’ to which to come on. I’d\r\ngive a month’s pay to get some o’ them broad-backed beggars in London\r\nsweatin’ through a day’s road-makin’ an’ a night’s rain. They’d carry on\r\na deal afterwards--same as we’re supposed to carry on. I’ve bin turned\r\nout of a measly arf-license pub down Lambeth way, full o’ greasy kebmen,\r\n‘fore now,’ said Ortheris with an oath.\r\n\r\n‘Maybe you were dhrunk,’ said Mulvaney soothingly.\r\n\r\n‘Worse nor that. The Forders were drunk. _I_ was wearin’ the Queen’s\r\nuniform.’\r\n\r\n‘I’d no particular thought to be a soldier i’ them days,’ said Learoyd,\r\nstill keeping his eye on the bare hill opposite, ‘but this sort o’ talk\r\nput it i’ my head. They was so good, th’ chapel folk, that they tumbled\r\nower t’other side. But I stuck to it for ‘Liza’s sake, specially as\r\nshe was learning me to sing the bass part in a horotorio as Jesse were\r\ngettin’ up. She sung like a throstle hersen, and we had practisin’s\r\nnight after night for a matter of three months.’\r\n\r\n‘I know what a horotorio is,’ said Ortheris pertly. ‘It’s a sort of\r\nchaplain’s sing-song--words all out of the Bible, and hullabaloojah\r\nchoruses.’\r\n\r\n‘Most Greenhow Hill folks played some instrument or t’other, an’ they\r\nall sung so you might have heard them miles away, and they were so\r\npleased wi’ the noise they made they didn’t fair to want anybody to\r\nlisten. The preacher sung high seconds when he wasn’t playin’ the\r\nflute, an’ they set me, as hadn’t got far with big fiddle, again Willie\r\nSatterthwaite, to jog his elbow when he had to get a’ gate playin’. Old\r\nJesse was happy if ever a man was, for he were th’ conductor an’ th’\r\nfirst fiddle an’ th’ leadin’ singer, beatin’ time wi’ his fiddle-stick,\r\ntill at times he’d rap with it on the table, and cry out, “Now, you mun\r\nall stop; it’s my turn.” And he’d face round to his front, fair\r\nsweating wi’ pride, to sing th’ tenor solos. But he were grandest i’ th’\r\nchoruses, waggin’ his head, flinging his arms round like a windmill, and\r\nsingin’ hisself black in the face. A rare singer were Jesse.\r\n\r\n‘Yo’ see, I was not o’ much account wi’ ‘em all exceptin’ to ‘Liza\r\nRoantree, and I had a deal o’ time settin’ quiet at meetings and\r\nhorotorio practises to hearken their talk, and if it were strange to me\r\nat beginnin’, it got stranger still at after, when I was shut on it, and\r\ncould study what it meaned.\r\n\r\n‘Just after th’ horotorios come off, ‘Liza, as had allus been weakly\r\nlike, was took very bad. I walked Dr. Warbottom’s horse up and down\r\na deal of times while he were inside, where they wouldn’t let me go,\r\nthough I fair ached to see her.\r\n\r\n‘“She’ll be better i’ noo, lad--better i’ noo,” he used to say. “Tha\r\nmun ha’ patience.” Then they said if I was quiet I might go in, and th’\r\nReverend Amos Barraclough used to read to her lyin’ propped up among th’\r\npillows. Then she began to mend a bit, and they let me carry her on to\r\nth’ settle, and when it got warm again she went about same as afore. Th’\r\npreacher and me and Blast was a deal together i’ them days, and i’ one\r\nway we was rare good comrades. But I could ha’ stretched him time and\r\nagain with a good will. I mind one day he said he would like to go\r\ndown into th’ bowels o’ th’ earth, and see how th’ Lord had builded th’\r\nframework o’ th’ everlastin’ hills. He were one of them chaps as had\r\na gift o’ sayin’ things. They rolled off the tip of his clever tongue,\r\nsame as Mulvaney here, as would ha’ made a rare good preacher if he had\r\nnobbut given his mind to it. I lent him a suit o’ miner’s kit as almost\r\nburied th’ little man, and his white face down i’ th’ coat-collar and\r\nhat-flap looked like the face of a boggart, and he cowered down i’ th’\r\nbottom o’ the waggon. I was drivin’ a tram as led up a bit of an incline\r\nup to th’ cave where the engine was pumpin’, and where th’ ore was\r\nbrought up and put into th’ waggons as went down o’ themselves, me\r\nputtin’ th’ brake on and th’ horses a-trottin’ after. Long as it was\r\ndaylight we were good friends, but when we got fair into th’ dark,\r\nand could nobbut see th’ day shinin’ at the hole like a lamp at a\r\nstreet-end, I feeled downright wicked. Ma religion dropped all away from\r\nme when I looked back at him as were always comin’ between me and ‘Liza.\r\nThe talk was ‘at they were to be wed when she got better, an’ I couldn’t\r\nget her to say yes or nay to it. He began to sing a hymn in his thin\r\nvoice, and I came out wi’ a chorus that was all cussin’ an’ swearin’ at\r\nmy horses, an’ I began to know how I hated him. He were such a little\r\nchap, too. I could drop him wi’ one hand down Garstang’s Copper-hole--a\r\nplace where th’ beck slithered ower th’ edge on a rock, and fell wi’ a\r\nbit of a whisper into a pit as no rope i’ Greenhow could plump.’\r\n\r\nAgain Learoyd rooted up the innocent violets. ‘Ay, he should see th’\r\nbowels o’ th’ earth an’ never naught else. I could take him a mile\r\nor two along th’ drift, and leave him wi’ his candle doused to cry\r\nhallelujah, wi’ none to hear him and say amen. I was to lead him down\r\nth’ ladder-way to th’ drift where Jesse Roantree was workin’, and why\r\nshouldn’t he slip on th’ ladder, wi’ my feet on his fingers till they\r\nloosed grip, and I put him down wi’ my heel? If I went fust down th’\r\nladder I could click hold on him and chuck him over my head, so as he\r\nshould go squshin’ down the shaft, breakin’ his bones at ev’ry timberin’\r\nas Bill Appleton did when he was fresh, and hadn’t a bone left when he\r\nwrought to th’ bottom. Niver a blasted leg to walk from Pately. Niver an\r\narm to put round ‘Liza Roantree’s waist. Niver no more--niver no more.’\r\n\r\nThe thick lips curled back over the yellow teeth, and that flushed face\r\nwas not pretty to look upon. Mulvaney nodded sympathy, and Ortheris,\r\nmoved by his comrade’s passion, brought up the rifle to his shoulder,\r\nand searched the hillside for his quarry, muttering ribaldry about a\r\nsparrow, a spout, and a thunder-storm. The voice of the watercourse\r\nsupplied the necessary small talk till Learoyd picked up his story.\r\n\r\n‘But it’s none so easy to kill a man like you. When I’d given up my\r\nhorses to th’ lad as took my place and I was showin’ th’ preacher th’\r\nworkin’s, shoutin’ into his ear across th’ clang o’ th’ pumpin’ engines,\r\nI saw he were afraid o’ naught; and when the lamplight showed his black\r\neyes, I could feel as he was masterin’ me again. I were no better nor\r\nBlast chained up short and growlin’ i’ the depths of him while a strange\r\ndog went safe past.\r\n\r\n‘“Th’art a coward and a fool,” I said to mysen; an’ I wrestled i’ my\r\nmind again’ him till, when we come to Garstang’s Copper-hole, I laid\r\nhold o’ the preacher and lifted him up over my head and held him into\r\nthe darkest on it. “Now, lad,” I says “it’s to be one or t’other on\r\nus--thee or me--for ‘Liza Roantree. Why, isn’t thee afraid for thysen?”\r\n I says, for he were still i’ my arms as a sack. “Nay; I’m but afraid\r\nfor thee, my poor lad, as knows naught,” says he. I set him down on th’\r\nedge, an’ th’ beck run stiller, an’ there was no more buzzin’ in my head\r\nlike when th’ bee come through th’ window o’ Jesse’s house. “What dost\r\ntha mean?” says I.\r\n\r\n‘“I’ve often thought as thou ought to know,” says he, “but ‘twas hard\r\nto tell thee. ‘Liza Roantree’s for neither on us, nor for nobody o’\r\nthis earth. Dr. Warbottom says--and he knows her, and her mother before\r\nher--that she is in a decline, and she cannot live six months longer.\r\nHe’s known it for many a day. Steady, John! Steady!” says he. And that\r\nweak little man pulled me further back and set me again’ him, and talked\r\nit all over quiet and still, me turnin’ a bunch o’ candles in my hand,\r\nand counting them ower and ower again as I listened. A deal on it were\r\nth’ regular preachin’ talk, but there were a vast lot as made me begin\r\nto think as he were more of a man than I’d ever given him credit for,\r\ntill I were cut as deep for him as I were for mysen.\r\n\r\n‘Six candles we had, and we crawled and climbed all that day while they\r\nlasted, and I said to mysen, “‘Liza Roantree hasn’t six months to live.”\r\n And when we came into th’ daylight again we were like dead men to look\r\nat, an’ Blast come behind us without so much as waggin’ his tail. When\r\nI saw ‘Liza again she looked at me a minute and says, “Who’s telled tha?\r\nFor I see tha knows.” And she tried to smile as she kissed me, and I\r\nfair broke down.\r\n\r\n‘Yo’ see, I was a young chap i’ them days, and had seen naught o’ life,\r\nlet alone death, as is allus a-waitin’. She telled me as Dr. Warbottom\r\nsaid as Greenhow air was too keen, and they were goin’ to Bradford, to\r\nJesse’s brother David, as worked i’ a mill, and I mun hold up like a man\r\nand a Christian, and she’d pray for me. Well, and they went away, and\r\nthe preacher that same back end o’ th’ year were appointed to another\r\ncircuit, as they call it, and I were left alone on Greenhow Hill.\r\n\r\n‘I tried, and I tried hard, to stick to th’ chapel, but ‘tweren’t th’\r\nsame thing at after. I hadn’t ‘Liza’s voice to follow i’ th’ singin’,\r\nnor her eyes a-shinin’ acrost their heads. And i’ th’ class-meetings\r\nthey said as I mun have some experiences to tell, and I hadn’t a word to\r\nsay for mysen.\r\n\r\n‘Blast and me moped a good deal, and happen we didn’t behave ourselves\r\nover well, for they dropped us and wondered however they’d come to take\r\nus up. I can’t tell how we got through th’ time, while i’ th’ winter I\r\ngave up my job and went to Bradford. Old Jesse were at th’ door o’ th’\r\nhouse, in a long street o’ little houses. He’d been sendin’ th’ children\r\n‘way as were clatterin’ their clogs in th’ causeway, for she were\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n‘“Is it thee?” he says; “but you’re not to see her. I’ll none have her\r\nwakened for a nowt like thee. She’s goin’ fast, and she mun go in peace.\r\nThou’lt never be good for naught i’ th’ world, and as long as thou lives\r\nthou’ll never play the big fiddle. Get away, lad, get away!” So he shut\r\nthe door softly i’ my face.\r\n\r\n‘Nobody never made Jesse my master, but it seemed to me he was about\r\nright, and I went away into the town and knocked up against a recruiting\r\nsergeant. The old tales o’ th’ chapel folk came buzzin’ into my head. I\r\nwas to get away, and this were th’ regular road for the likes o’ me. I\r\n‘listed there and then, took th’ Widow’s shillin’, and had a bunch o’\r\nribbons pinned i’ my hat.\r\n\r\n‘But next day I found my way to David Roantree’s door, and Jesse came\r\nto open it. Says he, “Thou’s come back again wi’ th’ devil’s colours\r\nflyin’--thy true colours, as I always telled thee.”\r\n\r\n‘But I begged and prayed of him to let me see her nobbut to say\r\ngood-bye, till a woman calls down th’ stairway, “She says John Learoyd’s\r\nto come up.” Th’ old man shifts aside in a flash, and lays his hand on\r\nmy arm, quite gentle like. “But thou’lt be quiet, John,” says he, “for\r\nshe’s rare and weak. Thou was allus a good lad.”\r\n\r\n‘Her eyes were all alive wi’ light, and her hair was thick on the pillow\r\nround her, but her cheeks were thin--thin to frighten a man that’s\r\nstrong. “Nay, father, yo mayn’t say th’ devil’s colours. Them ribbons\r\nis pretty.” An’ she held out her hands for th’ hat, an’ she put all\r\nstraight as a woman will wi’ ribbons. “Nay, but what they’re pretty,”\r\n she says. “Eh, but I’d ha’ liked to see thee i’ thy red coat, John, for\r\nthou was allus my own lad--my very own lad, and none else.”\r\n\r\n‘She lifted up her arms, and they come round my neck i’ a gentle grip,\r\nand they slacked away, and she seemed fainting. “Now yo’ mun get away,\r\nlad,” says Jesse, and I picked up my hat and I came downstairs.\r\n\r\n‘Th’ recruiting sergeant were waitin’ for me at th’ corner public-house.\r\n“Yo’ve seen your sweetheart?” says he. “Yes, I’ve seen her,” says I.\r\n“Well, we’ll have a quart now, and you’ll do your best to forget her,”\r\n says he, bein’ one o’ them smart, bustlin’ chaps. “Ay, sergeant,” says\r\nI. “Forget her.” And I’ve been forgettin’ her ever since.’\r\n\r\nHe threw away the wilted clump of white violets as he spoke. Ortheris\r\nsuddenly rose to his knees, his rifle at his shoulder, and peered across\r\nthe valley in the clear afternoon light. His chin cuddled the stock, and\r\nthere was a twitching of the muscles of the right cheek as he sighted;\r\nPrivate Stanley Ortheris was engaged on his business. A speck of white\r\ncrawled up the watercourse.\r\n\r\n‘See that beggar? . . . Got ‘im.’\r\n\r\nSeven hundred yards away, and a full two hundred down the hillside, the\r\ndeserter of the Aurangabadis pitched forward, rolled down a red rock,\r\nand lay very still, with his face in a clump of blue gentians, while a\r\nbig raven flapped out of the pine wood to make investigation.\r\n\r\n‘That’s a clean shot, little man,’ said Mulvaney.\r\n\r\nLearoyd thoughtfully watched the smoke clear away.\r\n\r\n‘Happen there was a lass tewed up wi’ him, too,’ said he.\r\n\r\nOrtheris did not reply. He was staring across the valley, with the smile\r\nof the artist who looks on the completed work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO WAS\r\n\r\n\r\n The Earth gave up her dead that tide,\r\n      Into our camp he came,\r\n And said his say, and went his way,\r\n      And left our hearts aflame.\r\n\r\n Keep tally--on the gun-butt score\r\n      The vengeance we must take,\r\n When God shall bring full reckoning,\r\n      For our dead comrade’s sake.\r\n                        BALLAD.\r\n\r\nLet it be clearly understood that the Russian is a delightful person\r\ntill he tucks in his shirt. As an Oriental he is charming. It is only\r\nwhen he insists upon being treated as the most easterly of western\r\npeoples instead of the most westerly of easterns that he becomes a\r\nracial anomaly extremely difficult to handle. The host never knows which\r\nside of his nature is going to turn up next.\r\n\r\nDirkovitch was a Russian--a Russian of the Russians--who appeared to get\r\nhis bread by serving the Czar as an officer in a Cossack regiment, and\r\ncorresponding for a Russian newspaper with a name that was never twice\r\nalike. He was a handsome young Oriental, fond of wandering through\r\nunexplored portions of the earth, and he arrived in India from nowhere\r\nin particular. At least no living man could ascertain whether it was by\r\nway of Balkh, Badakshan, Chitral, Beluchistan, or Nepaul, or anywhere\r\nelse. The Indian Government, being in an unusually affable mood, gave\r\norders that he was to be civilly treated and shown everything that was\r\nto be seen. So he drifted, talking bad English and worse French, from\r\none city to another, till he foregathered with Her Majesty’s White\r\nHussars in the city of Peshawur, which stands at the mouth of that\r\nnarrow swordcut in the hills that men call the Khyber Pass. He was\r\nundoubtedly an officer, and he was decorated after the manner of the\r\nRussians with little enamelled crosses, and he could talk, and (though\r\nthis has nothing to do with his merits) he had been given up as a\r\nhopeless task, or cask, by the Black Tyrone, who individually and\r\ncollectively, with hot whisky and honey, mulled brandy, and mixed\r\nspirits of every kind, had striven in all hospitality to make him drunk.\r\nAnd when the Black Tyrone, who are exclusively Irish, fail to disturb\r\nthe peace of head of a foreigner--that foreigner is certain to be a\r\nsuperior man.\r\n\r\nThe White Hussars were as conscientious in choosing their wine as in\r\ncharging the enemy. All that they possessed, including some wondrous\r\nbrandy, was placed at the absolute disposition of Dirkovitch, and he\r\nenjoyed himself hugely--even more than among the Black Tyrones.\r\n\r\nBut he remained distressingly European through it all. The White Hussars\r\nwere ‘My dear true friends,’ ‘Fellow-soldiers glorious,’ and ‘Brothers\r\ninseparable.’ He would unburden himself by the hour on the glorious\r\nfuture that awaited the combined arms of England and Russia when their\r\nhearts and their territories should run side by side and the great\r\nmission of civilising Asia should begin. That was unsatisfactory,\r\nbecause Asia is not going to be civilised after the methods of the West.\r\nThere is too much Asia and she is too old. You cannot reform a lady of\r\nmany lovers, and Asia has been insatiable in her flirtations aforetime.\r\nShe will never attend Sunday-school or learn to vote save with swords\r\nfor tickets.\r\n\r\nDirkovitch knew this as well as any one else, but it suited him to talk\r\nspecial-correspondently and to make himself as genial as he could. Now\r\nand then he volunteered a little, a very little, information about\r\nhis own sotnia of Cossacks, left apparently to look after themselves\r\nsomewhere at the back of beyond. He had done rough work in Central Asia,\r\nand had seen rather more help-yourself fighting than most men of his\r\nyears. But he was careful never to betray his superiority, and more than\r\ncareful to praise on all occasions the appearance, drill, uniform, and\r\norganisation of Her Majesty’s White Hussars. And indeed they were a\r\nregiment to be admired. When Lady Durgan, widow of the late Sir John\r\nDurgan, arrived in their station, and after a short time had been\r\nproposed to by every single man at mess, she put the public sentiment\r\nvery neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless\r\nshe could marry them all, including the colonel and some majors already\r\nmarried, she was not going to content herself with one hussar.\r\nWherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment, being by nature\r\ncontradictious; and the White Hussars were going to wear crape on their\r\narms, but compromised by attending the wedding in full force, and lining\r\nthe aisle with unutterable reproach. She had jilted them all--from\r\nBasset-Holmer the senior captain to little Mildred the junior subaltern,\r\nwho could have given her four thousand a year and a title.\r\n\r\nThe only persons who did not share the general regard for the White\r\nHussars were a few thousand gentlemen of Jewish extraction who lived\r\nacross the border, and answered to the name of Pathan. They had once met\r\nthe regiment officially and for something less than twenty minutes, but\r\nthe interview, which was complicated with many casualties, had filled\r\nthem with prejudice. They even called the White Hussars children of the\r\ndevil and sons of persons whom it would be perfectly impossible to meet\r\nin decent society. Yet they were not above making their aversion\r\nfill their money-belts. The regiment possessed carbines--beautiful\r\nMartini-Henri carbines that would lob a bullet into an enemy’s camp at\r\none thousand yards, and were even handier than the long rifle. Therefore\r\nthey were coveted all along the border, and since demand inevitably\r\nbreeds supply, they were supplied at the risk of life and limb for\r\nexactly their weight in coined silver--seven and one-half pounds weight\r\nof rupees, or sixteen pounds sterling reckoning the rupee at par.\r\nThey were stolen at night by snaky-haired thieves who crawled on their\r\nstomachs under the nose of the sentries; they disappeared mysteriously\r\nfrom locked arm-racks, and in the hot weather, when all the barrack\r\ndoors and windows were open, they vanished like puffs of their\r\nown smoke. The border people desired them for family vendettas and\r\ncontingencies. But in the long cold nights of the northern Indian winter\r\nthey were stolen most extensively. The traffic of murder was liveliest\r\namong the hills at that season, and prices ruled high. The regimental\r\nguards were first doubled and then trebled. A trooper does not much\r\ncare if he loses a weapon--Government must make it good--but he deeply\r\nresents the loss of his sleep. The regiment grew very angry, and one\r\nrifle-thief bears the visible marks of their anger upon him to this\r\nhour. That incident stopped the burglaries for a time, and the guards\r\nwere reduced accordingly, and the regiment devoted itself to polo with\r\nunexpected results; for it beat by two goals to one that very terrible\r\npolo corps the Lushkar Light Horse, though the latter had four ponies\r\napiece for a short hour’s fight, as well as a native officer who played\r\nlike a lambent flame across the ground.\r\n\r\nThey gave a dinner to celebrate the event. The Lushkar team came, and\r\nDirkovitch came, in the fullest full uniform of a Cossack officer, which\r\nis as full as a dressing-gown, and was introduced to the Lushkars, and\r\nopened his eyes as he regarded. They were lighter men than the Hussars,\r\nand they carried themselves with the swing that is the peculiar right of\r\nthe Punjab Frontier Force and all Irregular Horse. Like everything else\r\nin the Service it has to be learnt, but, unlike many things, it is never\r\nforgotten, and remains on the body till death.\r\n\r\nThe great beam-roofed mess-room of the White Hussars was a sight to be\r\nremembered. All the mess plate was out on the long table--the same table\r\nthat had served up the bodies of five officers after a forgotten fight\r\nlong and long ago--the dingy, battered standards faced the door of\r\nentrance, clumps of winter-roses lay between the silver candlesticks,\r\nand the portraits of eminent officers deceased looked down on their\r\nsuccessors from between the heads of sambhur, nilghai, markhor,\r\nand, pride of all the mess, two grinning snow-leopards that had cost\r\nBasset-Holmer four months’ leave that he might have spent in England,\r\ninstead of on the road to Thibet and the daily risk of his life by\r\nledge, snow-slide, and grassy slope.\r\n\r\nThe servants in spotless white muslin and the crest of their regiments\r\non the brow of their turbans waited behind their masters, who were clad\r\nin the scarlet and gold of the White Hussars, and the cream and silver\r\nof the Lushkar Light Horse. Dirkovitch’s dull green uniform was the only\r\ndark spot at the board, but his big onyx eyes made up for it. He was\r\nfraternising effusively with the captain of the Lushkar team, who\r\nwas wondering how many of Dirkovitch’s Cossacks his own dark wiry\r\ndown-countrymen could account for in a fair charge. But one does not\r\nspeak of these things openly.\r\n\r\nThe talk rose higher and higher, and the regimental band played between\r\nthe courses, as is the immemorial custom, till all tongues ceased for\r\na moment with the removal of the dinner-slips and the first toast of\r\nobligation, when an officer rising said, ‘Mr. Vice, the Queen,’ and\r\nlittle Mildred from the bottom of the table answered, ‘The Queen, God\r\nbless her,’ and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves\r\nup and drank the Queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to\r\nsettle their mess-bills. That Sacrament of the Mess never grows old, and\r\nnever ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever he\r\nbe by sea or by land. Dirkovitch rose with his ‘brothers glorious,’ but\r\nhe could not understand. No one but an officer can tell what the toast\r\nmeans; and the bulk have more sentiment than comprehension. Immediately\r\nafter the little silence that follows on the ceremony there entered the\r\nnative officer who had played for the Lushkar team. He could not, of\r\ncourse, eat with the mess, but he came in at dessert, all six feet\r\nof him, with the blue and silver turban atop, and the big black boots\r\nbelow. The mess rose joyously as he thrust forward the hilt of his sabre\r\nin token of fealty for the colonel of the White Hussars to touch, and\r\ndropped into a vacant chair amid shouts of: ‘Rung ho, Hira Singh!’\r\n(which being translated means ‘Go in and win’). ‘Did I whack you over\r\nthe knee, old man?’ ‘Ressaidar Sahib, what the devil made you play that\r\nkicking pig of a pony in the last ten minutes?’ ‘Shabash, Ressaidar\r\nSahib!’ Then the voice of the colonel, ‘The health of Ressaidar Hira\r\nSingh!’\r\n\r\nAfter the shouting had died away Hira Singh rose to reply, for he was\r\nthe cadet of a royal house, the son of a king’s son, and knew what was\r\ndue on these occasions. Thus he spoke in the vernacular:--‘Colonel Sahib\r\nand officers of this regiment. Much honour have you done me. This will I\r\nremember. We came down from afar to play you. But we were beaten.’ [‘No\r\nfault of yours, Ressaidar Sahib. Played on our own ground y’know. Your\r\nponies were cramped from the railway. Don’t apologise!’) ‘Therefore\r\nperhaps we will come again if it be so ordained.’ [‘Hear! Hear! Hear,\r\nindeed! Bravo! Hsh!’) ‘Then we will play you afresh’ [‘Happy to meet\r\nyou.’) ‘till there are left no feet upon our ponies. Thus far for\r\nsport.’ He dropped one hand on his sword-hilt and his eye wandered to\r\nDirkovitch lolling back in his chair. ‘But if by the will of God there\r\narises any other game which is not the polo game, then be assured,\r\nColonel Sahib and officers, that we will play it out side by side,\r\nthough THEY,’ again his eye sought Dirkovitch, ‘though THEY I say have\r\nfifty ponies to our one horse.’ And with a deep-mouthed Rung ho! that\r\nsounded like a musket-butt on flagstones he sat down amid leaping\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nDirkovitch, who had devoted himself steadily to the brandy--the terrible\r\nbrandy aforementioned--did not understand, nor did the expurgated\r\ntranslations offered to him at all convey the point. Decidedly Hira\r\nSingh’s was the speech of the evening, and the clamour might have\r\ncontinued to the dawn had it not been broken by the noise of a shot\r\nwithout that sent every man feeling at his defenceless left side. Then\r\nthere was a scuffle and a yell of pain.\r\n\r\n‘Carbine-stealing again!’ said the adjutant, calmly sinking back in\r\nhis chair. ‘This comes of reducing the guards. I hope the sentries have\r\nkilled him.’\r\n\r\nThe feet of armed men pounded on the verandah flags, and it was as\r\nthough something was being dragged.\r\n\r\n‘Why don’t they put him in the cells till the morning?’ said the colonel\r\ntestily. ‘See if they’ve damaged him, sergeant.’\r\n\r\nThe mess sergeant fled out into the darkness and returned with two\r\ntroopers and a corporal, all very much perplexed.\r\n\r\n‘Caught a man stealin’ carbines, sir,’ said the corporal. ‘Leastways ‘e\r\nwas crawlin’ towards the barricks, sir, past the main road sentries, an’\r\nthe sentry ‘e sez, sir--’\r\n\r\nThe limp heap of rags upheld by the three men groaned. Never was seen so\r\ndestitute and demoralised an Afghan. He was turbanless, shoeless, caked\r\nwith dirt, and all but dead with rough handling. Hira Singh started\r\nslightly at the sound of the man’s pain. Dirkovitch took another glass\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\n‘WHAT does the sentry say?’ said the colonel.\r\n\r\n‘Sez ‘e speaks English, sir,’ said the corporal.\r\n\r\n‘So you brought him into mess instead of handing him over to the\r\nsergeant! If he spoke all the Tongues of the Pentecost you’ve no\r\nbusiness--’\r\n\r\nAgain the bundle groaned and muttered. Little Mildred had risen from his\r\nplace to inspect. He jumped back as though he had been shot.\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps it would be better, sir, to send the men away,’ said he to the\r\ncolonel, for he was a much privileged subaltern. He put his arms round\r\nthe ragbound horror as he spoke, and dropped him into a chair. It may\r\nnot have been explained that the littleness of Mildred lay in his being\r\nsix feet four and big in proportion. The corporal seeing that an officer\r\nwas disposed to look after the capture, and that the colonel’s eye was\r\nbeginning to blaze, promptly removed himself and his men. The mess was\r\nleft alone with the carbine-thief, who laid his head on the table and\r\nwept bitterly, hopelessly, and inconsolably, as little children weep.\r\n\r\nHira Singh leapt to his feet. ‘Colonel Sahib,’ said he, ‘that man is no\r\nAfghan, for they weep Ai! Ai! Nor is he of Hindustan, for they weep Oh!\r\nHo! He weeps after the fashion of the white men, who say Ow! Ow!’\r\n\r\n‘Now where the dickens did you get that knowledge, Hira Singh?’ said the\r\ncaptain of the Lushkar team.\r\n\r\n‘Hear him!’ said Hira Singh simply, pointing at the crumpled figure that\r\nwept as though it would never cease.\r\n\r\n‘He said, “My God!”’ said little Mildred. ‘I heard him say it.’\r\n\r\nThe colonel and the mess-room looked at the man in silence. It is a\r\nhorrible thing to hear a man cry. A woman can sob from the top of her\r\npalate, or her lips, or anywhere else, but a man must cry from his\r\ndiaphragm, and it rends him to pieces.\r\n\r\n‘Poor devil!’ said the colonel, coughing tremendously. ‘We ought to send\r\nhim to hospital. He’s been man-handled.’\r\n\r\nNow the adjutant loved his carbines. They were to him as his\r\ngrandchildren, the men standing in the first place. He grunted\r\nrebelliously: ‘I can understand an Afghan stealing, because he’s built\r\nthat way. But I can’t understand his crying. That makes it worse.’\r\n\r\nThe brandy must have affected Dirkovitch, for he lay back in his chair\r\nand stared at the ceiling. There was nothing special in the ceiling\r\nbeyond a shadow as of a huge black coffin. Owing to some peculiarity in\r\nthe construction of the mess-room this shadow was always thrown when\r\nthe candles were lighted. It never disturbed the digestion of the White\r\nHussars. They were in fact rather proud of it.\r\n\r\n‘Is he going to cry all night?’ said the colonel, ‘or are we supposed to\r\nsit up with little Mildred’s guest until he feels better?’\r\n\r\nThe man in the chair threw up his head and stared at the mess. ‘Oh, my\r\nGod!’ he said, and every soul in the mess rose to his feet. Then the\r\nLushkar captain did a deed for which he ought to have been given the\r\nVictoria Cross--distinguished gallantry in a fight against overwhelming\r\ncuriosity. He picked up his team with his eyes as the hostess picks up\r\nthe ladies at the opportune moment, and pausing only by the colonel’s\r\nchair to say, ‘This isn’t OUR affair, you know, sir,’ led them into the\r\nverandah and the gardens. Hira Singh was the last to go, and he looked\r\nat Dirkovitch. But Dirkovitch had departed into a brandy-paradise of his\r\nown. His lips moved without sound and he was studying the coffin on the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n‘White--white all over,’ said Basset-Holmer, the adjutant. ‘What a\r\npernicious renegade he must be! I wonder where he came from?’\r\n\r\nThe colonel shook the man gently by the arm, and ‘Who are you?’ said he.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. The man stared round the mess-room and smiled in\r\nthe colonel’s face. Little Mildred, who was always more of a woman than\r\na man till ‘Boot and saddle’ was sounded, repeated the question in a\r\nvoice that would have drawn confidences from a geyser. The man only\r\nsmiled. Dirkovitch at the far end of the table slid gently from his\r\nchair to the floor.\r\n\r\nNo son of Adam in this present imperfect world can mix the Hussars’\r\nchampagne with the Hussars’ brandy by five and eight glasses of each\r\nwithout remembering the pit whence he was digged and descending thither.\r\nThe band began to play the tune with which the White Hussars from the\r\ndate of their formation have concluded all their functions. They would\r\nsooner be disbanded than abandon that tune; it is a part of their\r\nsystem. The man straightened himself in his chair and drummed on the\r\ntable with his fingers.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t see why we should entertain lunatics,’ said the colonel. ‘Call\r\na guard and send him off to the cells. We’ll look into the business in\r\nthe morning. Give him a glass of wine first though.’\r\n\r\nLittle Mildred filled a sherry-glass with the brandy and thrust it over\r\nto the man. He drank, and the tune rose louder, and he straightened\r\nhimself yet more. Then he put out his long-taloned hands to a piece of\r\nplate opposite and fingered it lovingly. There was a mystery connected\r\nwith that piece of plate, in the shape of a spring which converted what\r\nwas a seven-branched candlestick, three springs on each side and one in\r\nthe middle, into a sort of wheel-spoke candelabrum. He found the spring,\r\npressed it, and laughed weakly. He rose from his chair and inspected a\r\npicture on the wall, then moved on to another picture, the mess watching\r\nhim without a word. When he came to the mantelpiece he shook his head\r\nand seemed distressed. A piece of plate representing a mounted hussar\r\nin full uniform caught his eye. He pointed to it, and then to the\r\nmantelpiece with inquiry in his eyes.\r\n\r\n‘What is it--Oh what is it?’ said little Mildred. Then as a mother might\r\nspeak to a child, ‘That is a horse. Yes, a horse.’\r\n\r\nVery slowly came the answer in a thick, passionless guttural--‘Yes,\r\nI--have seen. But--where is THE horse?’\r\n\r\nYou could have heard the hearts of the mess beating as the men drew back\r\nto give the stranger full room in his wanderings. There was no question\r\nof calling the guard.\r\n\r\nAgain he spoke--very slowly, ‘Where is OUR horse?’\r\n\r\nThere is but one horse in the White Hussars, and his portrait hangs\r\noutside the door of the mess-room. He is the piebald drum-horse,\r\nthe king of the regimental band, that served the regiment for\r\nseven-and-thirty years, and in the end was shot for old age. Half the\r\nmess tore the thing down from its place and thrust it into the man’s\r\nhands. He placed it above the mantel-piece, it clattered on the ledge\r\nas his poor hands dropped it, and he staggered towards the bottom of\r\nthe table, falling into Mildred’s chair. Then all the men spoke to one\r\nanother something after this fashion, ‘The drum-horse hasn’t hung over\r\nthe mantelpiece since ‘67.’ ‘How does he know?’ ‘Mildred, go and speak\r\nto him again.’ ‘Colonel, what are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, dry up, and\r\ngive the poor devil a chance to pull himself together.’ ‘It isn’t\r\npossible anyhow. The man’s a lunatic.’\r\n\r\nLittle Mildred stood at the colonel’s side talking in his ear. ‘Will you\r\nbe good enough to take your seats please, gentlemen!’ he said, and the\r\nmess dropped into the chairs. Only Dirkovitch’s seat, next to little\r\nMildred’s, was blank, and little Mildred himself had found Hira Singh’s\r\nplace. The wide-eyed mess-sergeant filled the glasses in deep silence.\r\nOnce more the colonel rose, but his hand shook and the port spilled on\r\nthe table as he looked straight at the man in little Mildred’s chair and\r\nsaid hoarsely, ‘Mr. Vice, the Queen.’ There was a little pause, but the\r\nman sprung to his feet and answered without hesitation, ‘The Queen,\r\nGod bless her!’ and as he emptied the thin glass he snapped the shank\r\nbetween his fingers.\r\n\r\nLong and long ago, when the Empress of India was a young woman and there\r\nwere no unclean ideals in the land, it was the custom of a few messes\r\nto drink the Queen’s toast in broken glass, to the vast delight of the\r\nmess-contractors. The custom is now dead, because there is nothing to\r\nbreak anything for, except now and again the word of a Government, and\r\nthat has been broken already.\r\n\r\n‘That settles it,’ said the colonel, with a gasp. ‘He’s not a sergeant.\r\nWhat in the world is he?’\r\n\r\nThe entire mess echoed the word, and the volley of questions would have\r\nscared any man. It was no wonder that the ragged, filthy invader could\r\nonly smile and shake his head.\r\n\r\nFrom under the table, calm and smiling, rose Dirkovitch, who had been\r\nroused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body. By the side of the\r\nman he rose, and the man shrieked and grovelled. It was a horrible sight\r\ncoming so swiftly upon the pride and glory of the toast that had brought\r\nthe strayed wits together.\r\n\r\nDirkovitch made no offer to raise him, but little Mildred heaved him\r\nup in an instant. It is not good that a gentleman who can answer to the\r\nQueen’s toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe hasty action tore the wretch’s upper clothing nearly to the waist,\r\nand his body was seamed with dry black scars. There is only one weapon\r\nin the world that cuts: in parallel lines, and it is neither the cane\r\nnor the cat. Dirkovitch saw the marks, and the pupils of his eyes\r\ndilated. Also his face changed. He said something that sounded like Shto\r\nve takete, and the man fawning answered, Chetyre.\r\n\r\n‘What’s that?’ said everybody together.\r\n\r\n‘His number. That is number four, you know.’ Dirkovitch spoke very\r\nthickly.\r\n\r\n‘What has a Queen’s officer to do with a qualified number?’ said the\r\nColonel, and an unpleasant growl ran round the table.\r\n\r\n‘How can I tell?’ said the affable Oriental with a sweet smile. ‘He\r\nis a--how you have it?--escape--run-a-way, from over there.’ He nodded\r\ntowards the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\n‘Speak to him if he’ll answer you, and speak to him gently,’ said little\r\nMildred, settling the man in a chair. It seemed most improper to all\r\npresent that Dirkovitch should sip brandy as he talked in purring,\r\nspitting Russian to the creature who answered so feebly and with such\r\nevident dread. But since Dirkovitch appeared to understand no one said\r\na word. All breathed heavily, leaning forward, in the long gaps of the\r\nconversation. The next time that they have no engagements on hand the\r\nWhite Hussars intend to go to St. Petersburg in a body to learn Russian.\r\n\r\n‘He does not know how many years ago,’ said Dirkovitch, facing the mess,\r\n‘but he says it was very long ago in a war. I think that there was an\r\naccident. He says he was of this glorious and distinguished regiment in\r\nthe war.’\r\n\r\n‘The rolls! The rolls! Holmer, get the rolls!’ said little Mildred,\r\nand the adjutant dashed off bare-headed to the orderly-room, where the\r\nmuster-rolls of the regiment were kept. He returned just in time to hear\r\nDirkovitch conclude, ‘Therefore, my dear friends, I am most sorry to\r\nsay there was an accident which would have been reparable if he had\r\napologised to that our colonel, which he had insulted.’\r\n\r\nThen followed another growl which the colonel tried to beat down. The\r\nmess was in no mood just then to weigh insults to Russian colonels.\r\n\r\n‘He does not remember, but I think that there was an accident, and so\r\nhe was not exchanged among the prisoners, but he was sent to another\r\nplace--how do you say?--the country. SO, he says, he came here. He does\r\nnot know how he came. Eh? He was at Chepany’--the man caught the word,\r\nnodded, and shivered--‘at Zhigansk and Irkutsk. I cannot understand how\r\nhe escaped. He says, too, that he was in the forests for many years,\r\nbut how many years he has forgotten--that with many things. It was an\r\naccident; done because he did not apologise to that our colonel. Ah!’\r\n\r\nInstead of echoing Dirkovitch’s sigh of regret, it is sad to record\r\nthat the White Hussars livelily exhibited un-Christian delight and other\r\nemotions, hardly restrained by their sense of hospitality. Holmer flung\r\nthe frayed and yellow regimental rolls on the table, and the men flung\r\nthemselves at these.\r\n\r\n‘Steady! Fifty-six--fifty-five--fifty-four,’ said Holmer. ‘Here we are.\r\n“Lieutenant Austin Limmason. MISSING.” That was before Sebastopol.\r\nWhat an infernal shame! Insulted one of their colonels, and was quietly\r\nshipped off. Thirty years of his life wiped out.’\r\n\r\n‘But he never apologised. Said he’d see him damned first,’ chorused the\r\nmess.\r\n\r\n‘Poor chap! I suppose he never had the chance afterwards. How did he\r\ncome here?’ said the colonel.\r\n\r\nThe dingy heap in the chair could give no answer.\r\n\r\n‘Do you know who you are?’\r\n\r\nIt laughed weakly.\r\n\r\n‘Do you know that you are Limmason--Lieutenant Limmason of the White\r\nHussars?’\r\n\r\nSwiftly as a shot came the answer, in a slightly surprised tone, ‘Yes,\r\nI’m Limmason, of course.’ The light died out in his eyes, and the man\r\ncollapsed, watching every motion of Dirkovitch with terror. A flight\r\nfrom Siberia may fix a few elementary facts in the mind, but it does not\r\nseem to lead to continuity of thought. The man could not explain how,\r\nlike a homing pigeon, he had found his way to his own old mess again.\r\nOf what he had suffered or seen he knew nothing. He cringed before\r\nDirkovitch as instinctively as he had pressed the spring of the\r\ncandlestick, sought the picture of the drum-horse, and answered to the\r\ntoast of the Queen. The rest was a blank that the dreaded Russian tongue\r\ncould only in part remove. His head bowed on his breast, and he giggled\r\nand cowered alternately.\r\n\r\nThe devil that lived in the brandy prompted Dirkovitch at this extremely\r\ninopportune moment to make a speech. He rose, swaying slightly, gripped\r\nthe table-edge, while his eyes glowed like opals, and began:\r\n\r\n‘Fellow-soldiers glorious--true friends and hospitables. It was an\r\naccident, and deplorable--most deplorable.’ Here he smiled sweetly all\r\nround the mess. ‘But you will think of this little, little thing. So\r\nlittle, is it not? The Czar! Posh! I slap my fingers--I snap my fingers\r\nat him. Do I believe in him? No! But in us Slav who has done nothing,\r\nHIM I believe. Seventy--how much--millions peoples that have done\r\nnothing--not one thing. Posh! Napoleon was an episode.’ He banged a\r\nhand on the table. ‘Hear you, old peoples, we have done nothing in\r\nthe world--out here. All our work is to do; and it shall be done, old\r\npeoples. Get a-way!’ He waved his hand imperiously, and pointed to the\r\nman. ‘You see him. He is not good to see. He was just one little--oh,\r\nso little--accident, that no one remembered. Now he is THAT! So will you\r\nbe, brother-soldiers so brave--so will you be. But you will never come\r\nback. You will all go where he is gone, or’--he pointed to the great\r\ncoffin-shadow on the ceiling, and muttering, ‘Seventy millions--get\r\na-way, you old peoples,’ fell asleep.\r\n\r\n‘Sweet, and to the point,’ said little Mildred. ‘What’s the use of\r\ngetting wroth? Let’s make this poor devil comfortable.’\r\n\r\nBut that was a matter suddenly and swiftly taken from the loving hands\r\nof the White Hussars. The lieutenant had returned only to go away again\r\nthree days later, when the wail of the Dead March, and the tramp of the\r\nsquadrons, told the wondering Station, who saw no gap in the mess-table,\r\nthat an officer of the regiment had resigned his new-found commission.\r\n\r\nAnd Dirkovitch, bland, supple, and always genial, went away too by a\r\nnight train. Little Mildred and another man saw him off, for he was the\r\nguest of the mess, and even had he smitten the colonel with the open\r\nhand, the law of that mess allowed no relaxation of hospitality.\r\n\r\n‘Good-bye, Dirkovitch, and a pleasant journey,’ said little Mildred.\r\n\r\n‘Au revoir,’ said the Russian.\r\n\r\n‘Indeed! But we thought you were going home?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but I will come again. My dear friends, is that road shut?’ He\r\npointed to where the North Star burned over the Khyber Pass.\r\n\r\n‘By Jove! I forgot. Of course. Happy to meet you, old man, any time you\r\nlike. Got everything you want? Cheroots, ice, bedding? That’s all right.\r\nWell, au revoir, Dirkovitch.’\r\n\r\n‘Um,’ said the other man, as the tail-lights of the train grew small.\r\n‘Of--all--the--unmitigated--!’\r\n\r\nLittle Mildred answered nothing, but watched the North Star and hummed\r\na selection from a recent Simla burlesque that had much delighted the\r\nWhite Hussars. It ran--\r\n\r\n     I’m sorry for Mister Bluebeard,\r\n     I’m sorry to cause him pain;\r\n     But a terrible spree there’s sure to be\r\n     When he comes back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD OF THE DISTRICT\r\n\r\n\r\n    There’s a convict more in the Central Jail,\r\n       Behind the old mud wall;\r\n     There’s a lifter less on the Border trail,\r\n       And the Queen’s Peace over all,\r\n                                    Dear boys\r\n     The Queen’s Peace over all.\r\n\r\n    For we must bear our leader’s blame,\r\n       On us the shame will fall,\r\n     If we lift our hand from a fettered land\r\n       And the Queen’s Peace over all,\r\n                                    Dear boys,\r\n     The Queen’s Peace over all!\r\n                      THE RUNNING OF SHINDAND.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Indus had risen in flood without warning. Last night it was a\r\nfordable shallow; to-night five miles of raving muddy water parted bank\r\nand caving bank, and the river was still rising under the moon. A litter\r\nborne by six bearded men, all unused to the work, stopped in the white\r\nsand that bordered the whiter plain.\r\n\r\n‘It’s God’s will,’ they said. ‘We dare not cross to-night, even in a\r\nboat. Let us light a fire and cook food. We be tired men.’\r\n\r\nThey looked at the litter inquiringly. Within, the Deputy Commissioner\r\nof the Kot-Kumharsen district lay dying of fever. They had brought him\r\nacross country, six fighting-men of a frontier clan that he had won over\r\nto the paths of a moderate righteousness, when he had broken down at the\r\nfoot of their inhospitable hills. And Tallantire, his assistant, rode\r\nwith them, heavy-hearted as heavy-eyed with sorrow and lack of sleep. He\r\nhad served under the sick man for three years, and had learned to love\r\nhim as men associated in toil of the hardest learn to love--or hate.\r\nDropping from his horse he parted the curtains of the litter and peered\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n‘Orde--Orde, old man, can you hear? We have to wait till the river goes\r\ndown, worse luck.’\r\n\r\n‘I hear,’ returned a dry whisper. ‘Wait till the river goes down. I\r\nthought we should reach camp before the dawn. Polly knows. She’ll meet\r\nme.’\r\n\r\nOne of the litter-men stared across the river and caught a faint twinkle\r\nof light on the far side. He whispered to Tallantire, ‘There are his\r\ncamp-fires, and his wife. They will cross in the morning, for they have\r\nbetter boats. Can he live so long?’\r\n\r\nTallantire shook his head. Yardley-Orde was very near to death. What\r\nneed to vex his soul with hopes of a meeting that could not be? The\r\nriver gulped at the banks, brought down a cliff of sand, and snarled\r\nthe more hungrily. The litter-men sought for fuel in the waste-dried\r\ncamel-thorn and refuse of the camps that had waited at the ford. Their\r\nsword-belts clinked as they moved softly in the haze of the moonlight,\r\nand Tallantire’s horse coughed to explain that he would like a blanket.\r\n\r\n‘I’m cold too,’ said the voice from the litter. ‘I fancy this is the\r\nend. Poor Polly!’\r\n\r\nTallantire rearranged the blankets. Khoda Dad Khan, seeing this,\r\nstripped off his own heavy-wadded sheepskin coat and added it to the\r\npile. ‘I shall be warm by the fire presently,’ said he. Tallantire\r\ntook the wasted body of his chief into his arms and held it against his\r\nbreast. Perhaps if they kept him very warm Orde might live to see his\r\nwife once more. If only blind Providence would send a three-foot fall in\r\nthe river!\r\n\r\n‘That’s better,’ said Orde faintly. ‘Sorry to be a nuisance, but is--is\r\nthere anything to drink?’\r\n\r\nThey gave him milk and whisky, and Tallantire felt a little warmth\r\nagainst his own breast. Orde began to mutter.\r\n\r\n‘It isn’t that I mind dying,’ he said. ‘It’s leaving Polly and\r\nthe district. Thank God! we have no children. Dick, you know, I’m\r\ndipped--awfully dipped--debts in my first five years’ service. It isn’t\r\nmuch of a pension, but enough for her. She has her mother at home.\r\nGetting there is the difficulty. And--and--you see, not being a\r\nsoldier’s wife--’\r\n\r\n‘We’ll arrange the passage home, of course,’ said Tallantire quietly.\r\n\r\n‘It’s not nice to think of sending round the hat; but, good Lord! how\r\nmany men I lie here and remember that had to do it! Morten’s dead--he\r\nwas of my year. Shaughnessy is dead, and he had children; I remember he\r\nused to read us their school-letters; what a bore we thought him! Evans\r\nis dead--Kot-Kumharsen killed him! Ricketts of Myndonie is dead--and I’m\r\ngoing too. “Man that is born of a woman is small potatoes and few in\r\nthe hill.” That reminds me, Dick; the four Khusru Kheyl villages in our\r\nborder want a one-third remittance this spring. That’s fair; their crops\r\nare bad. See that they get it, and speak to Ferris about the canal. I\r\nshould like to have lived till that was finished; it means so much for\r\nthe North-Indus villages--but Ferris is an idle beggar--wake him up.\r\nYou’ll have charge of the district till my successor comes. I wish they\r\nwould appoint you permanently; you know the folk. I suppose it will\r\nbe Bullows, though. ‘Good man, but too weak for frontier work; and he\r\ndoesn’t understand the priests. The blind priest at Jagai will bear\r\nwatching. You’ll find it in my papers,--in the uniform-case, I think.\r\nCall the Khusru Kheyl men up; I’ll hold my last public audience. Khoda\r\nDad Khan!’\r\n\r\nThe leader of the men sprang to the side of the litter, his companions\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n‘Men, I’m dying,’ said Orde quickly, in the vernacular; ‘and soon there\r\nwill be no more Orde Sahib to twist your tails and prevent you from\r\nraiding cattle.’\r\n\r\n‘God forbid this thing!’ broke out the deep bass chorus. ‘The Sahib is\r\nnot going to die.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, he is; and then he will know whether Mahomed speaks truth, or\r\nMoses. But you must be good men, when I am not here. Such of you as live\r\nin our borders must pay your taxes quietly as before. I have spoken of\r\nthe villages to be gently treated this year. Such of you as live in the\r\nhills must refrain from cattle-lifting, and burn no more thatch, and\r\nturn a deaf ear to the voice of the priests, who, not knowing the\r\nstrength of the Government, would lead you into foolish wars, wherein\r\nyou will surely die and your crops be eaten by strangers. And you must\r\nnot sack any caravans, and must leave your arms at the police-post when\r\nyou come in; as has been your custom, and my order. And Tallantire Sahib\r\nwill be with you, but I do not know who takes my place. I speak now true\r\ntalk, for I am as it were already dead, my children,--for though ye be\r\nstrong men, ye are children.’\r\n\r\n‘And thou art our father and our mother,’ broke in Khoda Dad Khan with\r\nan oath. ‘What shall we do, now there is no one to speak for us, or to\r\nteach us to go wisely!’\r\n\r\n‘There remains Tallantire Sahib. Go to him; he knows your talk and your\r\nheart. Keep the young men quiet, listen to the old men, and obey. Khoda\r\nDad Khan, take my ring. The watch and chain go to thy brother. Keep\r\nthose things for my sake, and I will speak to whatever God I may\r\nencounter and tell him that the Khusru Kheyl are good men. Ye have my\r\nleave to go.’\r\n\r\nKhoda Dad Khan, the ring upon his finger, choked audibly as he caught\r\nthe well-known formula that closed an interview. His brother turned\r\nto look across the river. The dawn was breaking, and a speck of white\r\nshowed on the dull silver of the stream. ‘She comes,’ said the man\r\nunder his breath. ‘Can he live for another two hours?’ And he pulled the\r\nnewly-acquired watch out of his belt and looked uncomprehendingly at the\r\ndial, as he had seen Englishmen do.\r\n\r\nFor two hours the bellying sail tacked and blundered up and down the\r\nriver, Tallantire still clasping Orde in his arms, and Khoda Dad Khan\r\nchafing his feet. He spoke now and again of the district and his wife,\r\nbut, as the end neared, more frequently of the latter. They hoped he did\r\nnot know that she was even then risking her life in a crazy native boat\r\nto regain him. But the awful foreknowledge of the dying deceived them.\r\nWrenching himself forward, Orde looked through the curtains and saw how\r\nnear was the sail. ‘That’s Polly,’ he said simply, though his mouth was\r\nwried with agony. ‘Polly and--the grimmest practical joke ever played on\r\na man. Dick--you’ll--have--to--explain.’\r\n\r\nAnd an hour later Tallantire met on the bank a woman in a gingham\r\nriding-habit and a sun-hat who cried out to him for her husband--her\r\nboy and her darling--while Khoda Dad Khan threw himself face-down on the\r\nsand and covered his eyes.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe very simplicity of the notion was its charm. What more easy to win\r\na reputation for far-seeing statesmanship, originality, and, above all,\r\ndeference to the desires of the people, than by appointing a child of\r\nthe country to the rule of that country? Two hundred millions of the\r\nmost loving and grateful folk under Her Majesty’s dominion would laud\r\nthe fact, and their praise would endure for ever. Yet he was indifferent\r\nto praise or blame, as befitted the Very Greatest of All the Viceroys.\r\nHis administration was based upon principle, and the principle must be\r\nenforced in season and out of season. His pen and tongue had created the\r\nNew India, teeming with possibilities--loud-voiced, insistent, a nation\r\namong nations--all his very own. Wherefore the Very Greatest of All the\r\nViceroys took another step in advance, and with it counsel of those\r\nwho should have advised him on the appointment of a successor to\r\nYardley-Orde. There was a gentleman and a member of the Bengal Civil\r\nService who had won his place and a university degree to boot in fair\r\nand open competition with the sons of the English. He was cultured,\r\nof the world, and, if report spoke truly, had wisely and, above all,\r\nsympathetically ruled a crowded district in South-Eastern Bengal. He had\r\nbeen to England and charmed many drawing-rooms there. His name, if the\r\nViceroy recollected aright, was Mr. Grish Chunder De, M. A. In short,\r\ndid anybody see any objection to the appointment, always on principle,\r\nof a man of the people to rule the people? The district in South-Eastern\r\nBengal might with advantage, he apprehended, pass over to a younger\r\ncivilian of Mr. G. C. De’s nationality (who had written a remarkably\r\nclever pamphlet on the political value of sympathy in administration);\r\nand Mr. G. C. De could be transferred northward to Kot-Kumharsen. The\r\nViceroy was averse, on principle, to interfering with appointments under\r\ncontrol of the Provincial Governments. He wished it to be understood\r\nthat he merely recommended and advised in this instance. As regarded the\r\nmere question of race, Mr. Grish Chunder De was more English than the\r\nEnglish, and yet possessed of that peculiar sympathy and insight which\r\nthe best among the best Service in the world could only win to at the\r\nend of their service.\r\n\r\nThe stern, black-bearded kings who sit about the Council-board of India\r\ndivided on the step, with the inevitable result of driving the Very\r\nGreatest of All the Viceroys into the borders of hysteria, and a\r\nbewildered obstinacy pathetic as that of a child.\r\n\r\n‘The principle is sound enough,’ said the weary-eyed Head of the Red\r\nProvinces in which Kot-Kumharsen lay, for he too held theories. ‘The\r\nonly difficulty is--’\r\n\r\n‘Put the screw on the District officials; brigade De with a very strong\r\nDeputy Commissioner on each side of him; give him the best assistant\r\nin the Province; rub the fear of God into the people beforehand; and\r\nif anything goes wrong, say that his colleagues didn’t back him up. All\r\nthese lovely little experiments recoil on the District-Officer in the\r\nend,’ said the Knight of the Drawn Sword with a truthful brutality that\r\nmade the Head of the Red Provinces shudder. And on a tacit understanding\r\nof this kind the transfer was accomplished, as quietly as might be for\r\nmany reasons.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to think that what goes for public opinion in India did not\r\ngenerally see the wisdom of the Viceroy’s appointment. There were not\r\nlacking indeed hireling organs, notoriously in the pay of a tyrannous\r\nbureaucracy, who more than hinted that His Excellency was a fool, a\r\ndreamer of dreams, a doctrinaire, and, worst of all, a trifler with the\r\nlives of men. ‘The Viceroy’s Excellence Gazette,’ published in Calcutta,\r\nwas at pains to thank ‘Our beloved Viceroy for once more and again thus\r\ngloriously vindicating the potentialities of the Bengali nations for\r\nextended executive and administrative duties in foreign parts beyond\r\nour ken. We do not at all doubt that our excellent fellow-townsman, Mr.\r\nGrish Chunder De, Esq., M. A., will uphold the prestige of the Bengali,\r\nnotwithstanding what underhand intrigue and peshbundi may be set on\r\nfoot to insidiously nip his fame and blast his prospects among the proud\r\ncivilians, some of which will now have to serve under a despised native\r\nand take orders too. How will you like that, Misters? We entreat\r\nour beloved Viceroy still to substantiate himself superiorly to\r\nrace-prejudice and colour-blindness, and to allow the flower of this now\r\nOUR Civil Service all the full pays and allowances granted to his more\r\nfortunate brethren.’\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n‘When does this man take over charge? I’m alone just now, and I gather\r\nthat I’m to stand fast under him.’\r\n\r\n‘Would you have cared for a transfer?’ said Bullows keenly. Then, laying\r\nhis hand on Tallantire’s shoulder: ‘We’re all in the same boat; don’t\r\ndesert us. And yet, why the devil should you stay, if you can get\r\nanother charge?’\r\n\r\n‘It was Orde’s,’ said Tallantire simply.\r\n\r\n‘Well, it’s De’s now. He’s a Bengali of the Bengalis, crammed with code\r\nand case law; a beautiful man so far as routine and deskwork go, and\r\npleasant to talk to. They naturally have always kept him in his own home\r\ndistrict, where all his sisters and his cousins and his aunts lived,\r\nsomewhere south of Dacca. He did no more than turn the place into a\r\npleasant little family preserve, allowed his subordinates to do what\r\nthey liked, and let everybody have a chance at the shekels. Consequently\r\nhe’s immensely popular down there.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ve nothing to do with that. How on earth am I to explain to the\r\ndistrict that they are going to be governed by a Bengali? Do you--does\r\nthe Government, I mean--suppose that the Khusru Kheyl will sit quiet\r\nwhen they once know? What will the Mahomedan heads of villages say? How\r\nwill the police--Muzbi Sikhs and Pathans--how will THEY work under him?\r\nWe couldn’t say anything if the Government appointed a sweeper; but\r\nmy people will say a good deal, you know that. It’s a piece of cruel\r\nfolly!’\r\n\r\n‘My dear boy, I know all that, and more. I’ve represented it, and have\r\nbeen told that I am exhibiting “culpable and puerile prejudice.” By\r\nJove, if the Khusru Kheyl don’t exhibit something worse than that I\r\ndon’t know the Border! The chances are that you will have the district\r\nalight on your hands, and I shall have to leave my work and help you\r\npull through. I needn’t ask you to stand by the Bengali man in every\r\npossible way. You’ll do that for your own sake.’\r\n\r\n‘For Orde’s. I can’t say that I care twopence personally.’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t be an ass. It’s grievous enough, God knows, and the Government\r\nwill know later on; but that’s no reason for your sulking. YOU must try\r\nto run the district, YOU must stand between him and as much insult as\r\npossible; YOU must show him the ropes; YOU must pacify the Khusru Kheyl,\r\nand just warn Curbar of the Police to look out for trouble by the way.\r\nI’m always at the end of a telegraph-wire, and willing to peril my\r\nreputation to hold the district together. You’ll lose yours, of course,\r\nIf you keep things straight, and he isn’t actually beaten with a stick\r\nwhen he’s on tour, he’ll get all the credit. If anything goes wrong,\r\nyou’ll be told that you didn’t support him loyally.’\r\n\r\n‘I know what I’ve got to do,’ said Tallantire wearily, ‘and I’m going to\r\ndo it. But it’s hard.’\r\n\r\n‘The work is with us, the event is with Allah,--as Orde used to say when\r\nhe was more than usually in hot water.’ And Bullows rode away.\r\n\r\nThat two gentlemen in Her Majesty’s Bengal Civil Service should thus\r\ndiscuss a third, also in that service, and a cultured and affable man\r\nwithal, seems strange and saddening. Yet listen to the artless babble of\r\nthe Blind Mullah of Jagai, the priest of the Khusru Kheyl, sitting upon\r\na rock overlooking the Border. Five years before, a chance-hurled shell\r\nfrom a screw-gun battery had dashed earth in the face of the Mullah,\r\nthen urging a rush of Ghazis against half a dozen British bayonets.\r\nSo he became blind, and hated the English none the less for the little\r\naccident. Yardley-Orde knew his failing, and had many times laughed at\r\nhim therefor.\r\n\r\n‘Dogs you are,’ said the Blind Mullah to the listening tribesmen round\r\nthe fire. ‘Whipped dogs! Because you listened to Orde Sahib and called\r\nhim father and behaved as his children, the British Government have\r\nproven how they regard you. Orde Sahib ye know is dead.’\r\n\r\n‘Ai! ai! ai!’ said half a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n‘He was a man. Comes now in his stead, whom think ye? A Bengali of\r\nBengal--an eater of fish from the South.’\r\n\r\n‘A lie!’ said Khoda Dad Khan. ‘And but for the small matter of thy\r\npriesthood, I’d drive my gun butt-first down thy throat.’\r\n\r\n‘Oho, art thou there, lickspittle of the English? Go in to-morrow across\r\nthe Border to pay service to Orde Sahib’s successor, and thou shalt slip\r\nthy shoes at the tent-door of a Bengali, as thou shalt hand thy offering\r\nto a Bengali’s black fist. This I know; and in my youth, when a young\r\nman spoke evil to a Mullah holding the doors of Heaven and Hell, the\r\ngun-butt was not rammed down the Mullah’s gullet. No!’\r\n\r\nThe Blind Mullah hated Khoda Dad Khan with Afghan hatred; both being\r\nrivals for the headship of the tribe; but the latter was feared for\r\nbodily as the other for spiritual gifts. Khoda Dad Khan looked at Orde’s\r\nring and grunted, ‘I go in to-morrow because I am not an old fool,\r\npreaching war against the English. If the Government, smitten with\r\nmadness, have done this, then...’\r\n\r\n‘Then,’ croaked the Mullah, ‘thou wilt take out the young men and strike\r\nat the four villages within the Border?’\r\n\r\n‘Or wring thy neck, black raven of Jehannum, for a bearer of\r\nill-tidings.’\r\n\r\nKhoda Dad Khan oiled his long locks with great care, put on his best\r\nBokhara belt, a new turban-cap and fine green shoes, and accompanied by\r\na few friends came down from the hills to pay a visit to the new Deputy\r\nCommissioner of Kot-Kumharsen. Also he bore tribute--four or five\r\npriceless gold mohurs of Akbar’s time in a white handkerchief. These the\r\nDeputy Commissioner would touch and remit. The little ceremony used to\r\nbe a sign that, so far as Khoda Dad Khan’s personal influence went,\r\nthe Khusru Kheyl would be good boys,--till the next time; especially\r\nif Khoda Dad Khan happened to like the new Deputy Commissioner. In\r\nYardley-Orde’s consulship his visit concluded with a sumptuous dinner\r\nand perhaps forbidden liquors; certainly with some wonderful tales and\r\ngreat good-fellowship. Then Khoda Dad Khan would swagger back to\r\nhis hold, vowing that Orde Sahib was one prince and Tallantire Sahib\r\nanother, and that whosoever went a-raiding into British territory would\r\nbe flayed alive. On this occasion he found the Deputy Commissioner’s\r\ntents looking much as usual. Regarding himself as privileged he strode\r\nthrough the open door to confont a suave, portly Bengali in English\r\ncostume writing at a table. Unversed in the elevating influence of\r\neducation, and not in the least caring for university degrees, Khoda\r\nDad Khan promptly set the man down for a Babu--the native clerk of the\r\nDeputy Commissioner--a hated and despised animal.\r\n\r\n‘Ugh!’ said he cheerfully. ‘Where’s your master, Babujee?’\r\n\r\n‘I am the Deputy Commissioner,’ said the gentleman in English. Now he\r\novervalued the effects of university degrees, and stared Khoda Dad Khan\r\nin the face. But if from your earliest infancy you have been accustomed\r\nto look on battle, murder, and sudden death, if spilt blood affects\r\nyour nerves as much as red paint, and, above all, if you have faithfully\r\nbelieved that the Bengali was the servant of all Hindustan, and that all\r\nHindustan was vastly inferior to your own large, lustful self, you can\r\nendure, even though uneducated, a very large amount of looking over. You\r\ncan even stare down a graduate of an Oxford college if the latter\r\nhas been born in a hothouse, of stock bred in a hothouse, and fearing\r\nphysical pain as some men fear sin; especially if your opponent’s mother\r\nhas frightened him to sleep in his youth with horrible stories of devils\r\ninhabiting Afghanistan, and dismal legends of the black North. The eyes\r\nbehind the gold spectacles sought the floor. Khoda Dad Khan chuckled,\r\nand swung out to find Tallantire hard by. ‘Here,’ said he roughly,\r\nthrusting the coins before him, ‘touch and remit. That answers for MY\r\ngood behaviour. But, O Sahib, has the Government gone mad to send a\r\nblack Bengali dog to us? And am I to pay service to such an one? And\r\nare you to work under him? What does it mean?’ ‘It is an order,’ said\r\nTallantire. He had expected something of this kind. ‘He is a very clever\r\nS-sahib.’\r\n\r\n‘He a Sahib! He’s a kala admi--a black man--unfit to run at the tail of\r\na potter’s donkey. All the peoples of the earth have harried Bengal. It\r\nis written. Thou knowest when we of the North wanted women or plunder\r\nwhither went we? To Bengal--where else? What child’s talk is this of\r\nSahibdom--after Orde Sahib too! Of a truth the Blind Mullah was right.’\r\n\r\n‘What of him?’ asked Tallantire uneasily. He mistrusted that old man\r\nwith his dead eyes and his deadly tongue.\r\n\r\n‘Nay, now, because of the oath that I sware to Orde Sahib when we\r\nwatched him die by the river yonder, I will tell. In the first place, is\r\nit true that the English have set the heel of the Bengali on their own\r\nneck, and that there is no more English rule in the land?’\r\n\r\n‘I am here,’ said Tallantire, ‘and I serve the Maharanee of England.’\r\n\r\n‘The Mullah said otherwise, and further that because we loved Orde Sahib\r\nthe Government sent us a pig to show that we were dogs, who till now\r\nhave been held by the strong hand. Also that they were taking away\r\nthe white soldiers, that more Hindustanis might come, and that all was\r\nchanging.’\r\n\r\nThis is the worst of ill-considered handling of a very large country.\r\nWhat looks so feasible in Calcutta, so right in Bombay, so unassailable\r\nin Madras, is misunderstood by the North and entirely changes its\r\ncomplexion on the banks of the Indus. Khoda Dad Khan explained as\r\nclearly as he could that, though he himself intended to be good, he\r\nreally could not answer for the more reckless members of his tribe under\r\nthe leadership of the Blind Mullah. They might or they might not give\r\ntrouble, but they certainly had no intention whatever of obeying the new\r\nDeputy Commissioner. Was Tallantire perfectly sure that in the event\r\nof any systematic border-raiding the force in the district could put it\r\ndown promptly?\r\n\r\n‘Tell the Mullah if he talks any more fool’s talk,’ said Tallantire\r\ncurtly, ‘that he takes his men on to certain death, and his tribe to\r\nblockade, trespass-fine, and blood-money. But why do I talk to one who\r\nno longer carries weight in the counsels of the tribe?’\r\n\r\nKhoda Dad Khan pocketed that insult. He had learned something that\r\nhe much wanted to know, and returned to his hills to be sarcastically\r\ncomplimented by the Mullah, whose tongue raging round the camp-fires was\r\ndeadlier flame than ever dung-cake fed.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBe pleased to consider here for a moment the unknown district of\r\nKot-Kumharsen. It lay cut lengthways by the Indus under the line of\r\nthe Khusru hills--ramparts of useless earth and tumbled stone. It was\r\nseventy miles long by fifty broad, maintained a population of something\r\nless than two hundred thousand, and paid taxes to the extent of forty\r\nthousand pounds a year on an area that was by rather more than half\r\nsheer, hopeless waste. The cultivators were not gentle people, the\r\nminers for salt were less gentle still, and the cattle-breeders least\r\ngentle of all. A police-post in the top right-hand corner and a tiny mud\r\nfort in the top left-hand corner prevented as much salt-smuggling and\r\ncattle-lifting as the influence of the civilians could not put down; and\r\nin the bottom right-hand corner lay Jumala, the district headquarters--a\r\npitiful knot of lime-washed barns facetiously rented as houses, reeking\r\nwith frontier fever, leaking in the rain, and ovens in the summer.\r\n\r\nIt was to this place that Grish Chunder De was travelling, there\r\nformally to take over charge of the district. But the news of his coming\r\nhad gone before. Bengalis were as scarce as poodles among the simple\r\nBorderers, who cut each other’s heads open with their long spades and\r\nworshipped impartially at Hindu and Mahomedan shrines. They crowded\r\nto see him, pointing at him, and diversely comparing him to a gravid\r\nmilch-buffalo, or a broken-down horse, as their limited range of\r\nmetaphor prompted. They laughed at his police-guard, and wished to know\r\nhow long the burly Sikhs were going to lead Bengali apes. They inquired\r\nwhether he had brought his women with him, and advised him explicitly\r\nnot to tamper with theirs. It remained for a wrinkled hag by the\r\nroadside to slap her lean breasts as he passed, crying, ‘I have suckled\r\nsix that could have eaten six thousand of HIM. The Government shot\r\nthem, and made this That a king!’ Whereat a blue-turbaned huge-boned\r\nplough-mender shouted, ‘Have hope, mother o’ mine! He may yet go the\r\nway of thy wastrels.’ And the children, the little brown puff-balls,\r\nregarded curiously. It was generally a good thing for infancy to stray\r\ninto Orde Sahib’s tent, where copper coins were to be won for the mere\r\nwishing, and tales of the most authentic, such as even their mothers\r\nknew but the first half of. No! This fat black man could never tell them\r\nhow Pir Prith hauled the eye-teeth out of ten devils; how the big stones\r\ncame to lie all in a row on top of the Khusru hills, and what happened\r\nif you shouted through the village-gate to the gray wolf at even ‘Badl\r\nKhas is dead.’ Meantime Grish Chunder De talked hastily and much to\r\nTallantire, after the manner of those who are ‘more English than the\r\nEnglish,’--of Oxford and ‘home,’ with much curious book-knowledge of\r\nbump-suppers, cricket-matches, hunting-runs, and other unholy sports of\r\nthe alien. ‘We must get these fellows in hand,’ he said once or twice\r\nuneasily; ‘get them well in hand, and drive them on a tight rein. No\r\nuse, you know, being slack with your district.’\r\n\r\nAnd a moment later Tallantire heard Debendra Nath De, who brotherliwise\r\nhad followed his kinsman’s fortune and hoped for the shadow of his\r\nprotection as a pleader, whisper in Bengali, ‘Better are dried fish at\r\nDacca than drawn swords at Delhi. Brother of mine, these men are devils,\r\nas our mother said. And you will always have to ride upon a horse!’\r\n\r\nThat night there was a public audience in a broken-down little town\r\nthirty miles from Jumala, when the new Deputy Commissioner, in reply to\r\nthe greetings of the subordinate native officials, delivered a speech.\r\nIt was a carefully thought-out speech, which would have been very\r\nvaluable had not his third sentence begun with three innocent words,\r\n‘Hamara hookum hai--It is my order.’ Then there was a laugh, clear and\r\nbell-like, from the back of the big tent, where a few border landholders\r\nsat, and the laugh grew and scorn mingled with it, and the lean, keen\r\nface of Debendra Nath De paled, and Grish Chunder turning to Tallantire\r\nspake: ‘YOU--you put up this arrangement.’ Upon that instant the\r\nnoise of hoofs rang without, and there entered Curbar, the District\r\nSuperintendent of Police, sweating and dusty. The State had tossed him\r\ninto a corner of the province for seventeen weary years, there to check\r\nsmuggling of salt, and to hope for promotion that never came. He had\r\nforgotten how to keep his white uniform clean, had screwed rusty spurs\r\ninto patent-leather shoes, and clothed his head indifferently with a\r\nhelmet or a turban. Soured, old, worn with heat and cold, he waited till\r\nhe should be entitled to sufficient pension to keep him from starving.\r\n\r\n‘Tallantire,’ said he, disregarding Grish Chunder De, ‘come outside.\r\nI want to speak to you.’ They withdrew. ‘It’s this,’ continued Curbar.\r\n‘The Khusru Kheyl have rushed and cut up half a dozen of the coolies on\r\nFerris’s new canal-embankment; killed a couple of men and carried off\r\na woman. I wouldn’t trouble you about that--Ferris is after them and\r\nHugonin, my assistant, with ten mounted police. But that’s only the\r\nbeginning, I fancy. Their fires are out on the Hassan Ardeb heights, and\r\nunless we’re pretty quick there’ll be a flare-up all along our Border.\r\nThey are sure to raid the four Khusru villages on our side of the line;\r\nthere’s been bad blood between them for years; and you know the Blind\r\nMullah has been preaching a holy war since Orde went out. What’s your\r\nnotion?’\r\n\r\n‘Damn!’ said Tallantire thoughtfully. ‘They’ve begun quick. Well, it\r\nseems to me I’d better ride off to Fort Ziar and get what men I can\r\nthere to picket among the lowland villages, if it’s not too late. Tommy\r\nDodd commands at Fort Ziar, I think. Ferris and Hugonin ought to teach\r\nthe canal-thieves a lesson, and--No, we can’t have the Head of the\r\nPolice ostentatiously guarding the Treasury. You go back to the canal.\r\nI’ll wire Bullows to come into Jumala with a strong police-guard, and\r\nsit on the Treasury. They won’t touch the place, but it looks well.’\r\n\r\n‘I--I--I insist upon knowing what this means,’ said the voice of the\r\nDeputy Commissioner, who had followed the speakers.\r\n\r\n‘Oh!’ said Curbar, who being in the Police could not understand that\r\nfifteen years of education must, on principle, change the Bengali into\r\na Briton. ‘There has been a fight on the Border, and heaps of men\r\nare killed. There’s going to be another fight, and heaps more will be\r\nkilled.’\r\n\r\n‘What for?’\r\n\r\n‘Because the teeming millions of this district don’t exactly approve of\r\nyou, and think that under your benign rule they are going to have a good\r\ntime. It strikes me that you had better make arrangements. I act, as you\r\nknow, by your orders. What do you advise?’\r\n\r\n‘I--I take you all to witness that I have not yet assumed charge of the\r\ndistrict,’ stammered the Deputy Commissioner, not in the tones of the\r\n‘more English.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, I thought so. Well, as I was saying, Tallantire, your plan is\r\nsound. Carry it out. Do you want an escort?’\r\n\r\n‘No; only a decent horse. But how about wiring to headquarters?’\r\n\r\n‘I fancy, from the colour of his cheeks, that your superior officer will\r\nsend some wonderful telegrams before the night’s over. Let him do that,\r\nand we shall have half the troops of the province coming up to see\r\nwhat’s the trouble. Well, run along, and take care of yourself--the\r\nKhusru Kheyl jab upwards from below, remember. Ho! Mir Khan, give\r\nTallantire Sahib the best of the horses, and tell five men to ride to\r\nJumala with the Deputy Commissioner Sahib Bahadur. There is a hurry\r\ntoward.’\r\n\r\nThere was; and it was not in the least bettered by Debendra Nath De\r\nclinging to a policeman’s bridle and demanding the shortest, the\r\nvery shortest way to Jumala. Now originality is fatal to the Bengali.\r\nDebendra Nath should have stayed with his brother, who rode steadfastly\r\nfor Jumala on the railway-line, thanking gods entirely unknown to\r\nthe most catholic of universities that he had not taken charge of the\r\ndistrict, and could still--happy resource of a fertile race!--fall sick.\r\n\r\nAnd I grieve to say that when he reached his goal two policemen, not\r\ndevoid of rude wit, who had been conferring together as they bumped in\r\ntheir saddles, arranged an entertainment for his behoof. It consisted of\r\nfirst one and then the other entering his room with prodigious details\r\nof war, the massing of bloodthirsty and devilish tribes, and the burning\r\nof towns. It was almost as good, said these scamps, as riding with\r\nCurbar after evasive Afghans. Each invention kept the hearer at work\r\nfor half an hour on telegrams which the sack of Delhi would hardly\r\nhave justified. To every power that could move a bayonet or transfer a\r\nterrified man, Grish Chunder De appealed telegraphically. He was alone,\r\nhis assistants had fled, and in truth he had not taken over charge of\r\nthe district. Had the telegrams been despatched many things would have\r\noccurred; but since the only signaller in Jumala had gone to bed, and\r\nthe station-master, after one look at the tremendous pile of paper,\r\ndiscovered that railway regulations forbade the forwarding of imperial\r\nmessages, policemen Ram Singh and Nihal Singh were fain to turn the\r\nstuff into a pillow and slept on it very comfortably.\r\n\r\nTallantire drove his spurs into a rampant skewbald stallion with\r\nchina-blue eyes, and settled himself for the forty-mile ride to Fort\r\nZiar. Knowing his district blindfold, he wasted no time hunting for\r\nshort cuts, but headed across the richer grazing-ground to the ford\r\nwhere Orde had died and been buried. The dusty ground deadened the noise\r\nof his horse’s hoofs, the moon threw his shadow, a restless goblin,\r\nbefore him, and the heavy dew drenched him to the skin. Hillock, scrub\r\nthat brushed against the horse’s belly, unmetalled road where the\r\nwhip-like foliage of the tamarisks lashed his forehead, illimitable\r\nlevels of lowland furred with bent and speckled with drowsing cattle,\r\nwaste, and hillock anew, dragged themselves past, and the skewbald was\r\nlabouring in the deep sand of the Indus-ford. Tallantire was conscious\r\nof no distinct thought till the nose of the dawdling ferry-boat grounded\r\non the farther side, and his horse shied snorting at the white headstone\r\nof Orde’s grave. Then he uncovered, and shouted that the dead might\r\nhear, ‘They’re out, old man! Wish me luck.’ In the chill of the dawn he\r\nwas hammering with a stirrup-iron at the gate of Fort Ziar, where fifty\r\nsabres of that tattered regiment, the Belooch Beshaklis were supposed to\r\nguard Her Majesty’s interests along a few hundred miles of Border. This\r\nparticular fort was commanded by a subaltern, who, born of the ancient\r\nfamily of the Derouletts, naturally answered to the name of Tommy Dodd.\r\nHim Tallantire found robed in a sheepskin coat, shaking with fever like\r\nan aspen, and trying to read the native apothecary’s list of invalids.\r\n\r\n‘So you’ve come, too,’ said he. ‘Well, we’re all sick here, and I don’t\r\nthink I can horse thirty men; but we’re bub--bub--bub blessed willing.\r\nStop, does this impress you as a trap or a lie?’ He tossed a scrap of\r\npaper to Tallantire, on which was written painfully in crabbed Gurmukhi,\r\n‘We cannot hold young horses. They will feed after the moon goes down in\r\nthe four border villages issuing from the Jagai pass on the next night.’\r\nThen in English round hand--‘Your sincere friend.’\r\n\r\n‘Good man!’ said Tallantire. ‘That’s Khoda Dad Khan’s work, I know.\r\nIt’s the only piece of English he could ever keep in his head, and he\r\nis immensely proud of it. He is playing against the Blind Mullah for his\r\nown hand--the treacherous young ruffian!’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t know the politics of the Khusru Kheyl, but if you’re satisfied, I\r\nam. That was pitched in over the gate-head last night, and I thought we\r\nmight pull ourselves together and see what was on. Oh, but we’re sick\r\nwith fever here and no mistake! Is this going to be a big business,\r\nthink you?’ said Tommy Dodd.\r\n\r\nTallantire gave him briefly the outlines of the case, and Tommy Dodd\r\nwhistled and shook with fever alternately. That day he devoted to\r\nstrategy, the art of war, and the enlivenment of the invalids, till at\r\ndusk there stood ready forty-two troopers, lean, worn, and dishevelled,\r\nwhom Tommy Dodd surveyed with pride, and addressed thus: ‘O men! If you\r\ndie you will go to Hell. Therefore endeavour to keep alive. But if you\r\ngo to Hell that place cannot be hotter than this place, and we are not\r\ntold that we shall there suffer from fever. Consequently be not afraid\r\nof dying. File out there!’ They grinned, and went.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt will be long ere the Khusru Kheyl forget their night attack on the\r\nlowland villages. The Mullah had promised an easy victory and unlimited\r\nplunder; but behold, armed troopers of the Queen had risen out of the\r\nvery earth, cutting, slashing, and riding down under the stars, so that\r\nno man knew where to turn, and all feared that they had brought an army\r\nabout their ears, and ran back to the hills. In the panic of that flight\r\nmore men were seen to drop from wounds inflicted by an Afghan knife\r\njabbed upwards, and yet more from long-range carbine-fire. Then there\r\nrose a cry of treachery, and when they reached their own guarded\r\nheights, they had left, with some forty dead and sixty wounded,\r\nall their confidence in the Blind Mullah on the plains below. They\r\nclamoured, swore, and argued round the fires; the women wailing for the\r\nlost, and the Mullah shrieking curses on the returned.\r\n\r\nThen Khoda Dad Khan, eloquent and unbreathed, for he had taken no part\r\nin the fight, rose to improve the occasion. He pointed out that the\r\ntribe owed every item of its present misfortune to the Blind Mullah, who\r\nhad lied in every possible particular and talked them into a trap. It\r\nwas undoubtedly an insult that a Bengali, the son of a Bengali, should\r\npresume to administer the Border, but that fact did not, as the Mullah\r\npretended, herald a general time of license and lifting; and the\r\ninexplicable madness of the English had not in the least impaired\r\ntheir power of guarding their marches. On the contrary, the baffled and\r\nout-generalled tribe would now, just when their food-stock was lowest,\r\nbe blockaded from any trade with Hindustan until they had sent hostages\r\nfor good behaviour, paid compensation for disturbance, and blood-money\r\nat the rate of thirty-six English pounds per head for every villager\r\nthat they might have slain. ‘And ye know that those lowland dogs will\r\nmake oath that we have slain scores. Will the Mullah pay the fines or\r\nmust we sell our guns?’ A low growl ran round the fires. ‘Now, seeing\r\nthat all this is the Mullah’s work, and that we have gained nothing but\r\npromises of Paradise thereby, it is in my heart that we of the Khusru\r\nKheyl lack a shrine whereat to pray. We are weakened, and henceforth\r\nhow shall we dare to cross into the Madar Kheyl border, as has been our\r\ncustom, to kneel to Pir Sajji’s tomb? The Madar men will fall upon us,\r\nand rightly. But our Mullah is a holy man. He has helped two score of us\r\ninto Paradise this night. Let him therefore accompany his flock, and we\r\nwill build over his body a dome of the blue tiles of Mooltan, and burn\r\nlamps at his feet every Friday night. He shall be a saint: we shall have\r\na shrine; and there our women shall pray for fresh seed to fill the gaps\r\nin our fighting-tale. How think you?’\r\n\r\nA grim chuckle followed the suggestion, and the soft wheep, wheep of\r\nunscabbarded knives followed the chuckle. It was an excellent notion,\r\nand met a long felt want of the tribe. The Mullah sprang to his feet,\r\nglaring with withered eyeballs at the drawn death he could not see, and\r\ncalling down the curses of God and Mahomed on the tribe. Then began a\r\ngame of blind man’s buff round and between the fires, whereof Khuruk\r\nShah, the tribal poet, has sung in verse that will not die.\r\n\r\nThey tickled him gently under the armpit with the knife-point. He leaped\r\naside screaming, only to feel a cold blade drawn lightly over the back\r\nof his neck, or a rifle-muzzle rubbing his beard. He called on his\r\nadherents to aid him, but most of these lay dead on the plains, for\r\nKhoda Dad Khan had been at some pains to arrange their decease. Men\r\ndescribed to him the glories of the shrine they would build, and the\r\nlittle children clapping their hands cried, ‘Run, Mullah, run! There’s\r\na man behind you!’ In the end, when the sport wearied, Khoda Dad Khan’s\r\nbrother sent a knife home between his ribs. ‘Wherefore,’ said Khoda Dad\r\nKhan with charming simplicity, ‘I am now Chief of the Khusru Kheyl!’ No\r\nman gainsaid him; and they all went to sleep very stiff and sore.\r\n\r\nOn the plain below Tommy Dodd was lecturing on the beauties of a cavalry\r\ncharge by night, and Tallantire, bowed on his saddle, was gasping\r\nhysterically because there was a sword dangling from his wrist flecked\r\nwith the blood of the Khusru Kheyl, the tribe that Orde had kept in\r\nleash so well. When a Rajpoot trooper pointed out that the skewbald’s\r\nright ear had been taken off at the root by some blind slash of its\r\nunskilled rider, Tallantire broke down altogether, and laughed and\r\nsobbed till Tommy Dodd made him lie down and rest.\r\n\r\n‘We must wait about till the morning,’ said he. ‘I wired to the Colonel\r\njust before we left, to send a wing of the Beshaklis after us. He’ll be\r\nfurious with me for monopolising the fun, though. Those beggars in the\r\nhills won’t give us any more trouble.’\r\n\r\n‘Then tell the Beshaklis to go on and see what has happened to Curbar\r\non the canal. We must patrol the whole line of the Border. You’re quite\r\nsure, Tommy, that--that stuff was--was only the skewbald’s ear?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, quite,’ said Tommy. ‘You just missed cutting off his head. _I_ saw\r\nyou when we went into the mess. Sleep, old man.’\r\n\r\nNoon brought two squadrons of Beshaklis and a knot of furious brother\r\nofficers demanding the court-martial of Tommy Dodd for ‘spoiling the\r\npicnic,’ and a gallop across country to the canal-works where Ferris,\r\nCurbar, and Hugonin were haranguing the terror-stricken coolies on the\r\nenormity of abandoning good work and high pay, merely because half a\r\ndozen of their fellows had been cut down. The sight of a troop of the\r\nBeshaklis restored wavering confidence, and the police-hunted section\r\nof the Khusru Kheyl had the joy of watching the canal-bank humming\r\nwith life as usual, while such of their men as had taken refuge in\r\nthe watercourses and ravines were being driven out by the troopers.\r\nBy sundown began the remorseless patrol of the Border by police and\r\ntrooper, most like the cow-boys’ eternal ride round restless cattle.\r\n\r\n‘Now,’ said Khoda Dad Khan to his fellows, pointing out a line of\r\ntwinkling fires below, ‘ye may see how far the old order changes. After\r\ntheir horse will come the little devil-guns that they can drag up to the\r\ntops of the hills, and, for aught I know, to the clouds when we crown\r\nthe hills. If the tribe-council thinks good, I will go to Tallantire\r\nSahib--who loves me--and see if I can stave off at least the blockade.\r\nDo I speak for the tribe?’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, speak for the tribe in God’s name. How those accursed fires wink!\r\nDo the English send their troops on the wire--or is this the work of the\r\nBengali?’\r\n\r\nAs Khoda Dad Khan went down the hill he was delayed by an interview\r\nwith a hard-pressed tribesman, which caused him to return hastily\r\nfor something he had forgotten. Then, handing himself over to the\r\ntwo troopers who had been chasing his friend, he claimed escort to\r\nTallantire Sahib, then with Bullows at Jumala. The Border was safe, and\r\nthe time for reasons in writing had begun.\r\n\r\n‘Thank Heaven!’ said Bullows, ‘that the trouble came at once. Of course\r\nwe can never put down the reason in black and white, but all India will\r\nunderstand. And it is better to have a sharp short outbreak than five\r\nyears of impotent administration inside the Border. It costs less. Grish\r\nChunder De has reported himself sick, and has been transferred to his\r\nown province without any sort of reprimand. He was strong on not having\r\ntaken over the district.’\r\n\r\n‘Of course,’ said Tallantire bitterly. ‘Well, what am I supposed to have\r\ndone that was wrong?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, you will be told that you exceeded all your powers, and should\r\nhave reported, and written, and advised for three weeks until the Khusru\r\nKheyl could really come down in force. But I don’t think the authorities\r\nwill dare to make a fuss about it. They’ve had their lesson. Have you\r\nseen Curbar’s version of the affair? He can’t write a report, but he can\r\nspeak the truth.’\r\n\r\n‘What’s the use of the truth? He’d much better tear up the report. I’m\r\nsick and heartbroken over it all. It was so utterly unnecessary--except\r\nin that it rid us of that Babu.’\r\n\r\nEntered unabashed Khoda Dad Khan, a stuffed forage-net in his hand, and\r\nthe troopers behind him.\r\n\r\n‘May you never be tired!’ said he cheerily. ‘Well, Sahibs, that was a\r\ngood fight, and Naim Shah’s mother is in debt to you, Tallantire Sahib.\r\nA clean cut, they tell me, through jaw, wadded coat, and deep into the\r\ncollar-bone. Well done! But I speak for the tribe. There has been a\r\nfault--a great fault. Thou knowest that I and mine, Tallantire Sahib,\r\nkept the oath we sware to Orde Sahib on the banks of the Indus.’\r\n\r\n‘As an Afghan keeps his knife--sharp on one side, blunt on the other,’\r\nsaid Tallantire.\r\n\r\n‘The better swing in the blow, then. But I speak God’s truth. Only the\r\nBlind Mullah carried the young men on the tip of his tongue, and said\r\nthat there was no more Border-law because a Bengali had been sent, and\r\nwe need not fear the English at all. So they came down to avenge that\r\ninsult and get plunder. Ye know what befell, and how far I helped. Now\r\nfive score of us are dead or wounded, and we are all shamed and sorry,\r\nand desire no further war. Moreover, that ye may better listen to us,\r\nwe have taken off the head of the Blind Mullah, whose evil counsels have\r\nled us to folly. I bring it for proof,’--and he heaved on the floor the\r\nhead. ‘He will give no more trouble, for I am chief now, and so I sit\r\nin a higher place at all audiences. Yet there is an offset to this head.\r\nThat was another fault. One of the men found that black Bengali beast,\r\nthrough whom this trouble arose, wandering on horseback and weeping.\r\nReflecting that he had caused loss of much good life, Alla Dad Khan,\r\nwhom, if you choose, I will to-morrow shoot, whipped off this head, and\r\nI bring it to you to cover your shame, that ye may bury it. See, no man\r\nkept the spectacles, though they were of gold.’\r\n\r\nSlowly rolled to Tallantire’s feet the crop-haired head of a spectacled\r\nBengali gentleman, open-eyed, open-mouthed--the head of Terror\r\nincarnate. Bullows bent down. ‘Yet another blood-fine and a heavy\r\none, Khoda Dad Khan, for this is the head of Debendra Nath, the man’s\r\nbrother. The Babu is safe long since. All but the fools of the Khusru\r\nKheyl know that.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I care not for carrion. Quick meat for me. The thing was under\r\nour hills asking the road to Jumala and Alla Dad Khan showed him the\r\nroad to Jehannum, being, as thou sayest, but a fool. Remains now what\r\nthe Government will do to us. As to the blockade--’\r\n\r\n‘Who art thou, seller of dog’s flesh,’ thundered Tallantire, ‘to speak\r\nof terms and treaties? Get hence to the hills--go, and wait there\r\nstarving, till it shall please the Government to call thy people out\r\nfor punishment--children and fools that ye be! Count your dead, and be\r\nstill. Best assured that the Government will send you a MAN!’\r\n\r\n‘Ay,’ returned Khoda Dad Khan, ‘for we also be men.’\r\n\r\nAs he looked Tallantire between the eyes, he added, ‘And by God, Sahib,\r\nmay thou be that man!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHOUT BENEFIT OF CLERGY\r\n\r\n\r\n     Before my Spring I garnered Autumn’s gain,\r\n     Out of her time my field was white with grain,\r\n       The year gave up her secrets to my woe.\r\n     Forced and deflowered each sick season lay,\r\n     In mystery of increase and decay;\r\n     I saw the sunset ere men saw the day,\r\n       Who am too wise in that I should not know.\r\n                             BITTER WATERS.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n‘But if it be a girl?’\r\n\r\n‘Lord of my life, it cannot be. I have prayed for so many nights, and\r\nsent gifts to Sheikh Badl’s shrine so often, that I know God will give\r\nus a son--a man-child that shall grow into a man. Think of this and be\r\nglad. My mother shall be his mother till I can take him again, and the\r\nmullah of the Pattan mosque shall cast his nativity--God send he be born\r\nin an auspicious hour!--and then, and then thou wilt never weary of me,\r\nthy slave.’\r\n\r\n‘Since when hast thou been a slave, my queen?’\r\n\r\n‘Since the beginning--till this mercy came to me. How could I be sure of\r\nthy love when I knew that I had been bought with silver?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, that was the dowry. I paid it to thy mother.’\r\n\r\n‘And she has buried it, and sits upon it all day long like a hen. What\r\ntalk is yours of dower! I was bought as though I had been a Lucknow\r\ndancing-girl instead of a child.’\r\n\r\n‘Art thou sorry for the sale?’\r\n\r\n‘I have sorrowed; but to-day I am glad. Thou wilt never cease to love me\r\nnow?--answer, my king.’\r\n\r\n‘Never--never. No.’\r\n\r\n‘Not even though the mem-log--the white women of thy own blood--love\r\nthee? And remember, I have watched them driving in the evening; they are\r\nvery fair.’\r\n\r\n‘I have seen fire-balloons by the hundred. I have seen the moon,\r\nand--then I saw no more fire-balloons.’\r\n\r\nAmeera clapped her hands and laughed. ‘Very good talk,’ she said. Then\r\nwith an assumption of great stateliness, ‘It is enough. Thou hast my\r\npermission to depart,--if thou wilt.’\r\n\r\nThe man did not move. He was sitting on a low red-lacquered couch in a\r\nroom furnished only with a blue and white floor-cloth, some rugs, and a\r\nvery complete collection of native cushions. At his feet sat a woman of\r\nsixteen, and she was all but all the world in his eyes. By every rule\r\nand law she should have been otherwise, for he was an Englishman, and\r\nshe a Mussulman’s daughter bought two years before from her mother, who,\r\nbeing left without money, would have sold Ameera shrieking to the Prince\r\nof Darkness if the price had been sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt was a contract entered into with a light heart; but even before the\r\ngirl had reached her bloom she came to fill the greater portion of John\r\nHolden’s life. For her, and the withered hag her mother, he had taken a\r\nlittle house overlooking the great red-walled city, and found,--when\r\nthe marigolds had sprung up by the well in the courtyard and Ameera\r\nhad established herself according to her own ideas of comfort, and her\r\nmother had ceased grumbling at the inadequacy of the cooking-places,\r\nthe distance from the daily market, and at matters of house-keeping in\r\ngeneral,--that the house was to him his home. Any one could enter his\r\nbachelor’s bungalow by day or night, and the life that he led there\r\nwas an unlovely one. In the house in the city his feet only could pass\r\nbeyond the outer courtyard to the women’s rooms; and when the big wooden\r\ngate was bolted behind him he was king in his own territory, with Ameera\r\nfor queen. And there was going to be added to this kingdom a third\r\nperson whose arrival Holden felt inclined to resent. It interfered with\r\nhis perfect happiness. It disarranged the orderly peace of the house\r\nthat was his own. But Ameera was wild with delight at the thought of it,\r\nand her mother not less so. The love of a man, and particularly a white\r\nman, was at the best an inconstant affair, but it might, both women\r\nargued, be held fast by a baby’s hands. ‘And then,’ Ameera would always\r\nsay, ‘then he will never care for the white mem-log. I hate them all--I\r\nhate them all.’\r\n\r\n‘He will go back to his own people in time,’ said the mother; ‘but by\r\nthe blessing of God that time is yet afar off.’\r\n\r\nHolden sat silent on the couch thinking of the future, and his thoughts\r\nwere not pleasant. The drawbacks of a double life are manifold. The\r\nGovernment, with singular care, had ordered him out of the station for a\r\nfortnight on special duty in the place of a man who was watching by the\r\nbedside of a sick wife. The verbal notification of the transfer had been\r\nedged by a cheerful remark that Holden ought to think himself lucky in\r\nbeing a bachelor and a free man. He came to break the news to Ameera.\r\n\r\n‘It is not good,’ she said slowly, ‘but it is not all bad. There is my\r\nmother here, and no harm will come to me--unless indeed I die of pure\r\njoy. Go thou to thy work and think no troublesome thoughts. When the\r\ndays are done I believe... nay, I am sure. And--and then I shall lay HIM\r\nin thy arms, and thou wilt love me for ever. The train goes to-night, at\r\nmidnight is it not? Go now, and do not let thy heart be heavy by cause\r\nof me. But thou wilt not delay in returning? Thou wilt not stay on the\r\nroad to talk to the bold white mem-log. Come back to me swiftly, my\r\nlife.’\r\n\r\nAs he left the courtyard to reach his horse that was tethered to the\r\ngate-post, Holden spoke to the white-haired old watchman who guarded the\r\nhouse, and bade him under certain contingencies despatch the filled-up\r\ntelegraph-form that Holden gave him. It was all that could be done, and\r\nwith the sensations of a man who has attended his own funeral Holden\r\nwent away by the night mail to his exile. Every hour of the day he\r\ndreaded the arrival of the telegram, and every hour of the night he\r\npictured to himself the death of Ameera. In consequence his work for\r\nthe State was not of first-rate quality, nor was his temper towards his\r\ncolleagues of the most amiable. The fortnight ended without a sign from\r\nhis home, and, torn to pieces by his anxieties, Holden returned to be\r\nswallowed up for two precious hours by a dinner at the club, wherein he\r\nheard, as a man hears in a swoon, voices telling him how execrably he\r\nhad performed the other man’s duties, and how he had endeared himself to\r\nall his associates. Then he fled on horseback through the night with\r\nhis heart in his mouth. There was no answer at first to his blows on\r\nthe gate, and he had just wheeled his horse round to kick it in when Pir\r\nKhan appeared with a lantern and held his stirrup.\r\n\r\n‘Has aught occurred?’ said Holden.\r\n\r\n‘The news does not come from my mouth, Protector of the Poor, but--’\r\nHe held out his shaking hand as befitted the bearer of good news who is\r\nentitled to a reward.\r\n\r\nHolden hurried through the courtyard. A light burned in the upper room.\r\nHis horse neighed in the gateway, and he heard a shrill little wail that\r\nsent all the blood into the apple of his throat. It was a new voice, but\r\nit did not prove that Ameera was alive.\r\n\r\n‘Who is there?’ he called up the narrow brick staircase.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of delight from Ameera, and then the voice of\r\nthe mother, tremulous with old age and pride--‘We be two women\r\nand--the--man--thy--son.’\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of the room Holden stepped on a naked dagger, that\r\nwas laid there to avert ill-luck, and it broke at the hilt under his\r\nimpatient heel.\r\n\r\n‘God is great!’ cooed Ameera in the half-light. ‘Thou hast taken his\r\nmisfortunes on thy head.’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, but how is it with thee, life of my life? Old woman, how is it with\r\nher?’\r\n\r\n‘She has forgotten her sufferings for joy that the child is born. There\r\nis no harm; but speak softly,’ said the mother.\r\n\r\n‘It only needed thy presence to make me all well,’ said Ameera. ‘My\r\nking, thou hast been very long away. What gifts hast thou for me? Ah,\r\nah! It is I that bring gifts this time. Look, my life, look. Was there\r\never such a babe? Nay, I am too weak even to clear my arm from him.’\r\n\r\n‘Rest then, and do not talk. I am here, bachari [little woman].’\r\n\r\n‘Well said, for there is a bond and a heel-rope [peecharee] between us\r\nnow that nothing can break. Look--canst thou see in this light? He is\r\nwithout spot or blemish. Never was such a man-child. Ya illah! he shall\r\nbe a pundit--no, a trooper of the Queen. And, my life, dost thou love me\r\nas well as ever, though I am faint and sick and worn? Answer truly.’\r\n\r\n‘Yea. I love as I have loved, with all my soul. Lie still, pearl, and\r\nrest.’\r\n\r\n‘Then do not go. Sit by my side here--so. Mother, the lord of this house\r\nneeds a cushion. Bring it.’ There was an almost imperceptible movement\r\non the part of the new life that lay in the hollow of Ameera’s arm.\r\n‘Aho!’ she said, her voice breaking with love. ‘The babe is a champion\r\nfrom his birth. He is kicking me in the side with mighty kicks. Was\r\nthere ever such a babe! And he is ours to us--thine and mine. Put thy\r\nhand on his head, but carefully, for he is very young, and men are\r\nunskilled in such matters.’\r\n\r\nVery cautiously Holden touched with the tips of his fingers the downy\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n‘He is of the faith,’ said Ameera; ‘for lying here in the night-watches\r\nI whispered the call to prayer and the profession of faith into his\r\nears. And it is most marvellous that he was born upon a Friday, as I\r\nwas born. Be careful of him, my life; but he can almost grip with his\r\nhands.’\r\n\r\nHolden found one helpless little hand that closed feebly on his finger.\r\nAnd the clutch ran through his body till it settled about his heart.\r\nTill then his sole thought had been for Ameera. He began to realise that\r\nthere was some one else in the world, but he could not feel that it\r\nwas a veritable son with a soul. He sat down to think, and Ameera dozed\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n‘Get hence, sahib,’ said her mother under her breath. ‘It is not good\r\nthat she should find you here on waking. She must be still.’\r\n\r\n‘I go,’ said Holden submissively. ‘Here be rupees. See that my baba gets\r\nfat and finds all that he needs.’\r\n\r\nThe chink of the silver roused Ameera. ‘I am his mother, and no\r\nhireling,’ she said weakly. ‘Shall I look to him more or less for the\r\nsake of money? Mother, give it back. I have born my lord a son.’\r\n\r\nThe deep sleep of weakness came upon her almost before the sentence was\r\ncompleted. Holden went down to the courtyard very softly with his heart\r\nat ease. Pir Khan, the old watchman, was chuckling with delight. ‘This\r\nhouse is now complete,’ he said, and without further comment thrust\r\ninto Holden’s hands the hilt of a sabre worn many years ago when he, Pir\r\nKhan, served the Queen in the police. The bleat of a tethered goat came\r\nfrom the well-kerb.\r\n\r\n‘There be two,’ said Pir Khan, ‘two goats of the best. I bought them,\r\nand they cost much money; and since there is no birth-party assembled\r\ntheir flesh will be all mine. Strike craftily, sahib! ‘Tis an\r\nill-balanced sabre at the best. Wait till they raise their heads from\r\ncropping the marigolds.’\r\n\r\n‘And why?’ said Holden, bewildered.\r\n\r\n‘For the birth-sacrifice. What else? Otherwise the child being unguarded\r\nfrom fate may die. The Protector of the Poor knows the fitting words to\r\nbe said.’\r\n\r\nHolden had learned them once with little thought that he would ever\r\nspeak them in earnest. The touch of the cold sabre-hilt in his palm\r\nturned suddenly to the clinging grip of the child upstairs--the child\r\nthat was his own son--and a dread of loss filled him.\r\n\r\n‘Strike!’ said Pir Khan. ‘Never life came into the world but life was\r\npaid for it. See, the goats have raised their heads. Now! With a drawing\r\ncut!’\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what he did Holden cut twice as he muttered the Mahomedan\r\nprayer that runs: ‘Almighty! In place of this my son I offer life for\r\nlife, blood for blood, head for head, bone for bone, hair for hair, skin\r\nfor skin.’ The waiting horse snorted and bounded in his pickets at the\r\nsmell of the raw blood that spirted over Holden’s riding-boots.\r\n\r\n‘Well smitten!’ said Pir Khan, wiping the sabre. ‘A swordsman was lost\r\nin thee. Go with a light heart, Heaven-born. I am thy servant, and the\r\nservant of thy son. May the Presence live a thousand years and... the\r\nflesh of the goats is all mine?’ Pir Khan drew back richer by a month’s\r\npay. Holden swung himself into the saddle and rode off through\r\nthe low-hanging wood-smoke of the evening. He was full of riotous\r\nexultation, alternating with a vast vague tenderness directed towards no\r\nparticular object, that made him choke as he bent over the neck of his\r\nuneasy horse. ‘I never felt like this in my life,’ he thought. ‘I’ll go\r\nto the club and pull myself together.’\r\n\r\nA game of pool was beginning, and the room was full of men. Holden\r\nentered, eager to get to the light and the company of his fellows,\r\nsinging at the top of his voice--\r\n\r\n    In Baltimore a-walking, a lady I did meet!\r\n\r\n‘Did you?’ said the club-secretary from his corner. ‘Did she happen to\r\ntell you that your boots were wringing wet? Great goodness, man, it’s\r\nblood!’\r\n\r\n‘Bosh!’ said Holden, picking his cue from the rack. ‘May I cut in? It’s\r\ndew. I’ve been riding through high crops. My faith! my boots are in a\r\nmess though!\r\n\r\n    ‘And if it be a girl she shall wear a wedding-ring,\r\n     And if it be a boy he shall fight for his king,\r\n     With his dirk, and his cap, and his little jacket blue,\r\n     He shall walk the quarter-deck--’\r\n\r\n‘Yellow on blue--green next player,’ said the marker monotonously.\r\n\r\n‘He shall walk the quarter-deck,--Am I green, marker? He shall walk the\r\nquarter-deck,--eh! that’s a bad shot,--As his daddy used to do!’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t see that you have anything to crow about,’ said a zealous\r\njunior civilian acidly. ‘The Government is not exactly pleased with your\r\nwork when you relieved Sanders.’\r\n\r\n‘Does that mean a wigging from headquarters?’ said Holden with an\r\nabstracted smile. ‘I think I can stand it.’\r\n\r\nThe talk beat up round the ever-fresh subject of each man’s work, and\r\nsteadied Holden till it was time to go to his dark empty bungalow, where\r\nhis butler received him as one who knew all his affairs. Holden remained\r\nawake for the greater part of the night, and his dreams were pleasant\r\nones.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n‘How old is he now?’\r\n\r\n‘Ya illah! What a man’s question! He is all but six weeks old; and on\r\nthis night I go up to the housetop with thee, my life, to count the\r\nstars. For that is auspicious. And he was born on a Friday under the\r\nsign of the Sun, and it has been told to me that he will outlive us both\r\nand get wealth. Can we wish for aught better, beloved?’\r\n\r\n‘There is nothing better. Let us go up to the roof, and thou shalt count\r\nthe stars--but a few only, for the sky is heavy with cloud.’\r\n\r\n‘The winter rains are late, and maybe they come out of season. Come,\r\nbefore all the stars are hid. I have put on my richest jewels.’\r\n\r\n‘Thou hast forgotten the best of all.’\r\n\r\n‘Ai! Ours. He comes also. He has never yet seen the skies.’\r\n\r\nAmeera climbed the narrow staircase that led to the flat roof. The\r\nchild, placid and unwinking, lay in the hollow of her right arm,\r\ngorgeous in silver-fringed muslin with a small skull-cap on his head.\r\nAmeera wore all that she valued most. The diamond nose-stud that takes\r\nthe place of the Western patch in drawing attention to the curve of the\r\nnostril, the gold ornament in the centre of the forehead studded with\r\ntallow-drop emeralds and flawed rubies, the heavy circlet of beaten gold\r\nthat was fastened round her neck by the softness of the pure metal, and\r\nthe chinking curb-patterned silver anklets hanging low over the rosy\r\nankle-bone. She was dressed in jade-green muslin as befitted a daughter\r\nof the Faith, and from shoulder to elbow and elbow to wrist ran\r\nbracelets of silver tied with floss silk, frail glass bangles slipped\r\nover the wrist in proof of the slenderness of the hand, and certain\r\nheavy gold bracelets that had no part in her country’s ornaments but,\r\nsince they were Holden’s gift and fastened with a cunning European snap,\r\ndelighted her immensely.\r\n\r\nThey sat down by the low white parapet of the roof, overlooking the city\r\nand its lights.\r\n\r\n‘They are happy down there,’ said Ameera. ‘But I do not think that they\r\nare as happy as we. Nor do I think the white mem-log are as happy. And\r\nthou?’\r\n\r\n‘I know they are not.’\r\n\r\n‘How dost thou know?’\r\n\r\n‘They give their children over to the nurses.’\r\n\r\n‘I have never seen that,’ said Ameera with a sigh, ‘nor do I wish to\r\nsee. Ahi!--she dropped her head on Holden’s shoulder,--‘I have counted\r\nforty stars, and I am tired. Look at the child, love of my life, he is\r\ncounting too.’\r\n\r\nThe baby was staring with round eyes at the dark of the heavens. Ameera\r\nplaced him in Holden’s arms, and he lay there without a cry.\r\n\r\n‘What shall we call him among ourselves?’ she said. ‘Look! Art thou ever\r\ntired of looking? He carries thy very eyes. But the mouth--’\r\n\r\n‘Is thine, most dear. Who should know better than I?’\r\n\r\n‘’Tis such a feeble mouth. Oh, so small! And yet it holds my heart\r\nbetween its lips. Give him to me now. He has been too long away.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, let him lie; he has not yet begun to cry.’\r\n\r\n‘When he cries thou wilt give him back--eh? What a man of mankind thou\r\nart! If he cried he were only the dearer to me. But, my life, what\r\nlittle name shall we give him?’\r\n\r\nThe small body lay close to Holden’s heart. It was utterly helpless and\r\nvery soft. He scarcely dared to breathe for fear of crushing it. The\r\ncaged green parrot that is regarded as a sort of guardian-spirit in most\r\nnative households moved on its perch and fluttered a drowsy wing.\r\n\r\n‘There is the answer,’ said Holden. ‘Mian Mittu has spoken. He shall be\r\nthe parrot. When he is ready he will talk mightily and run about. Mian\r\nMittu is the parrot in thy--in the Mussulman tongue, is it not?’\r\n\r\n‘Why put me so far off?’ said Ameera fretfully. ‘Let it be like unto\r\nsome English name--but not wholly. For he is mine.’\r\n\r\n‘Then call him Tota, for that is likest English.’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, Tota, and that is still the parrot. Forgive me, my lord, for a\r\nminute ago, but in truth he is too little to wear all the weight of Mian\r\nMittu for name. He shall be Tota--our Tota to us. Hearest thou, O small\r\none? Littlest, thou art Tota.’ She touched the child’s cheek, and he\r\nwaking wailed, and it was necessary to return him to his mother, who\r\nsoothed him with the wonderful rhyme of Are koko, Jare koko! which says:\r\n\r\n     Oh crow! Go crow! Baby’s sleeping sound,\r\n     And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound.\r\n     Only a penny a pound, baba, only a penny a pound.\r\n\r\nReassured many times as to the price of those plums, Tota cuddled\r\nhimself down to sleep. The two sleek, white well-bullocks in the\r\ncourtyard were steadily chewing the cud of their evening meal; old Pir\r\nKhan squatted at the head of Holden’s horse, his police sabre across\r\nhis knees, pulling drowsily at a big water-pipe that croaked like a\r\nbull-frog in a pond. Ameera’s mother sat spinning in the lower\r\nverandah, and the wooden gate was shut and barred. The music of a\r\nmarriage-procession came to the roof above the gentle hum of the city,\r\nand a string of flying-foxes crossed the face of the low moon.\r\n\r\n‘I have prayed,’ said Ameera after a long pause, ‘I have prayed for two\r\nthings. First, that I may die in thy stead if thy death is demanded, and\r\nin the second that I may die in the place of the child. I have prayed to\r\nthe Prophet and to Beebee Miriam [the Virgin Mary]. Thinkest thou either\r\nwill hear?’\r\n\r\n‘From thy lips who would not hear the lightest word?’\r\n\r\n‘I asked for straight talk, and thou hast given me sweet talk. Will my\r\nprayers be heard?’\r\n\r\n‘How can I say? God is very good.’\r\n\r\n‘Of that I am not sure. Listen now. When I die, or the child dies, what\r\nis thy fate? Living, thou wilt return to the bold white mem-log, for\r\nkind calls to kind.’\r\n\r\n‘Not always.’\r\n\r\n‘With a woman, no; with a man it is otherwise. Thou wilt in this life,\r\nlater on, go back to thine own folk. That I could almost endure, for\r\nI should be dead. But in thy very death thou wilt be taken away to a\r\nstrange place and a paradise that I do not know.’\r\n\r\n‘Will it be paradise?’\r\n\r\n‘Surely, for who would harm thee? But we two--I and the child--shall be\r\nelsewhere, and we cannot come to thee, nor canst thou come to us. In the\r\nold days, before the child was born, I did not think of these things;\r\nbut now I think of them always. It is very hard talk.’\r\n\r\n‘It will fall as it will fall. To-morrow we do not know, but to-day and\r\nlove we know well. Surely we are happy now.’\r\n\r\n‘So happy that it were well to make our happiness assured. And thy\r\nBeebee Miriam should listen to me; for she is also a woman. But then she\r\nwould envy me! It is not seemly for men to worship a woman.’\r\n\r\nHolden laughed aloud at Ameera’s little spasm of jealousy.\r\n\r\n‘Is it not seemly? Why didst thou not turn me from worship of thee,\r\nthen?’\r\n\r\n‘Thou a worshipper! And of me? My king, for all thy sweet words, well I\r\nknow that I am thy servant and thy slave, and the dust under thy feet.\r\nAnd I would not have it otherwise. See!’\r\n\r\nBefore Holden could prevent her she stooped forward and touched his\r\nfeet; recovering herself with a little laugh she hugged Tota closer to\r\nher bosom. Then, almost savagely--\r\n\r\n‘Is it true that the bold white mem-log live for three times the length\r\nof my life? Is it true that they make their marriages not before they\r\nare old women?’\r\n\r\n‘They marry as do others--when they are women.’\r\n\r\n‘That I know, but they wed when they are twenty-five. Is that true?’\r\n\r\n‘That is true.’\r\n\r\n‘Ya illah! At twenty-five! Who would of his own will take a wife even of\r\neighteen? She is a woman--aging every hour. Twenty-five! I shall be an\r\nold woman at that age, and--Those mem-log remain young for ever. How I\r\nhate them!’ ‘What have they to do with us?’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot tell. I know only that there may now be alive on this earth a\r\nwoman ten years older than I who may come to thee and take thy love ten\r\nyears after I am an old woman, gray-headed, and the nurse of Tota’s son.\r\nThat is unjust and evil. They should die too.’\r\n\r\n‘Now, for all thy years thou art a child, and shalt be picked up and\r\ncarried down the staircase.’\r\n\r\n‘Tota! Have a care for Tota, my lord! Thou at least art as foolish as\r\nany babe!’ Ameera tucked Tota out of harm’s way in the hollow of her\r\nneck, and was carried downstairs laughing in Holden’s arms, while Tota\r\nopened his eyes and smiled after the manner of the lesser angels.\r\n\r\nHe was a silent infant, and, almost before Holden could realise that he\r\nwas in the world, developed into a small gold-coloured little god and\r\nunquestioned despot of the house overlooking the city. Those were months\r\nof absolute happiness to Holden and Ameera--happiness withdrawn from\r\nthe world, shut in behind the wooden gate that Pir Khan guarded. By\r\nday Holden did his work with an immense pity for such as were not so\r\nfortunate as himself, and a sympathy for small children that amazed and\r\namused many mothers at the little station-gatherings. At nightfall he\r\nreturned to Ameera,--Ameera, full of the wondrous doings of Tota; how\r\nhe had been seen to clap his hands together and move his fingers with\r\nintention and purpose--which was manifestly a miracle--how later, he had\r\nof his own initiative crawled out of his low bedstead on to the floor\r\nand swayed on both feet for the space of three breaths.\r\n\r\n‘And they were long breaths, for my heart stood still with delight,’\r\nsaid Ameera.\r\n\r\nThen Tota took the beasts into his councils--the well-bullocks, the\r\nlittle gray squirrels, the mongoose that lived in a hole near the well,\r\nand especially Mian Mittu, the parrot, whose tail he grievously pulled,\r\nand Mian Mittu screamed till Ameera and Holden arrived.\r\n\r\n‘O villain! Child of strength! This to thy brother on the house-top!\r\nTobah, tobah! Fie! Fie! But I know a charm to make him wise as Suleiman\r\nand Aflatoun [Solomon and Plato]. Now look,’ said Ameera. She drew from\r\nan embroidered bag a handful of almonds. ‘See! we count seven. In the\r\nname of God!’\r\n\r\nShe placed Mian Mittu, very angry and rumpled, on the top of his cage,\r\nand seating herself between the babe and the bird she cracked and peeled\r\nan almond less white than her teeth. ‘This is a true charm, my life, and\r\ndo not laugh. See! I give the parrot one half and Tota the other.’ Mian\r\nMittu with careful beak took his share from between Ameera’s lips, and\r\nshe kissed the other half into the mouth of the child, who ate it slowly\r\nwith wondering eyes. ‘This I will do each day of seven, and without\r\ndoubt he who is ours will be a bold speaker and wise. Eh, Tota, what\r\nwilt thou be when thou art a man and I am gray-headed?’ Tota tucked his\r\nfat legs into adorable creases. He could crawl, but he was not going\r\nto waste the spring of his youth in idle speech. He wanted Mian Mittu’s\r\ntail to tweak.\r\n\r\nWhen he was advanced to the dignity of a silver belt--which, with a\r\nmagic square engraved on silver and hung round his neck, made up the\r\ngreater part of his clothing--he staggered on a perilous journey down\r\nthe garden to Pir Khan and proffered him all his jewels in exchange\r\nfor one little ride on Holden’s horse, having seen his mother’s mother\r\nchaffering with pedlars in the verandah. Pir Khan wept and set the\r\nuntried feet on his own gray head in sign of fealty, and brought the\r\nbold adventurer to his mother’s arms, vowing that Tota would be a leader\r\nof men ere his beard was grown.\r\n\r\nOne hot evening, while he sat on the roof between his father and mother\r\nwatching the never-ending warfare of the kites that the city boys flew,\r\nhe demanded a kite of his own with Pir Khan to fly it, because he had\r\na fear of dealing with anything larger than himself, and when Holden\r\ncalled him a ‘spark,’ he rose to his feet and answered slowly in defence\r\nof his new-found individuality, ‘Hum’park nahin hai. Hum admi hai [I am\r\nno spark, but a man].’\r\n\r\nThe protest made Holden choke and devote himself very seriously to a\r\nconsideration of Tota’s future. He need hardly have taken the trouble.\r\nThe delight of that life was too perfect to endure. Therefore it was\r\ntaken away as many things are taken away in India--suddenly and without\r\nwarning. The little lord of the house, as Pir Khan called him, grew\r\nsorrowful and complained of pains who had never known the meaning of\r\npain. Ameera, wild with terror, watched him through the night, and\r\nin the dawning of the second day the life was shaken out of him by\r\nfever--the seasonal autumn fever. It seemed altogether impossible\r\nthat he could die, and neither Ameera nor Holden at first believed the\r\nevidence of the little body on the bedstead. Then Ameera beat her head\r\nagainst the wall and would have flung herself down the well in the\r\ngarden had Holden not restrained her by main force.\r\n\r\nOne mercy only was granted to Holden. He rode to his office in broad\r\ndaylight and found waiting him an unusually heavy mail that demanded\r\nconcentrated attention and hard work. He was not, however, alive to this\r\nkindness of the gods.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe first shock of a bullet is no more than a brisk pinch. The wrecked\r\nbody does not send in its protest to the soul till ten or fifteen\r\nseconds later. Holden realised his pain slowly, exactly as he had\r\nrealised his happiness, and with the same imperious necessity for hiding\r\nall trace of it. In the beginning he only felt that there had been a\r\nloss, and that Ameera needed comforting, where she sat with her head on\r\nher knees shivering as Mian Mittu from the house-top called, Tota! Tota!\r\nTota! Later all his world and the daily life of it rose up to hurt him.\r\nIt was an outrage that any one of the children at the band-stand in the\r\nevening should be alive and clamorous, when his own child lay dead. It\r\nwas more than mere pain when one of them touched him, and stories told\r\nby over-fond fathers of their children’s latest performances cut him to\r\nthe quick. He could not declare his pain. He had neither help, comfort,\r\nnor sympathy; and Ameera at the end of each weary day would lead him\r\nthrough the hell of self-questioning reproach which is reserved for\r\nthose who have lost a child, and believe that with a little--just a\r\nlittle--more care it might have been saved.\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps,’ Ameera would say, ‘I did not take sufficient heed. Did I, or\r\ndid I not? The sun on the roof that day when he played so long alone\r\nand I was--ahi! braiding my hair--it may be that the sun then bred the\r\nfever. If I had warned him from the sun he might have lived. But, oh my\r\nlife, say that I am guiltless! Thou knowest that I loved him as I love\r\nthee. Say that there is no blame on me, or I shall die--I shall die!’\r\n\r\n‘There is no blame,--before God, none. It was written and how could we\r\ndo aught to save? What has been, has been. Let it go, beloved.’\r\n\r\n‘He was all my heart to me. How can I let the thought go when my arm\r\ntells me every night that he is not here? Ahi! Ahi! O Tota, come back to\r\nme--come back again, and let us be all together as it was before!’\r\n\r\n‘Peace, peace! For thine own sake, and for mine also, if thou lovest\r\nme--rest.’\r\n\r\n‘By this I know thou dost not care; and how shouldst thou? The white men\r\nhave hearts of stone and souls of iron. Oh, that I had married a man of\r\nmine own people--though he beat me--and had never eaten the bread of an\r\nalien!’\r\n\r\n‘Am I an alien--mother of my son?’\r\n\r\n‘What else--Sahib?... Oh, forgive me--forgive! The death has driven me\r\nmad. Thou art the life of my heart, and the light of my eyes, and the\r\nbreath of my life, and--and I have put thee from me, though it was but\r\nfor a moment. If thou goest away, to whom shall I look for help? Do not\r\nbe angry. Indeed, it was the pain that spoke and not thy slave.’\r\n\r\n‘I know, I know. We be two who were three. The greater need therefore\r\nthat we should be one.’\r\n\r\nThey were sitting on the roof as of custom. The night was a warm one in\r\nearly spring, and sheet-lightning was dancing on the horizon to a broken\r\ntune played by far-off thunder. Ameera settled herself in Holden’s arms.\r\n\r\n‘The dry earth is lowing like a cow for the rain, and I--I am afraid. It\r\nwas not like this when we counted the stars. But thou lovest me as much\r\nas before, though a bond is taken away? Answer!’\r\n\r\n‘I love more because a new bond has come out of the sorrow that we have\r\neaten together, and that thou knowest.’\r\n\r\n‘Yea, I knew,’ said Ameera in a very small whisper. ‘But it is good to\r\nhear thee say so, my life, who art so strong to help. I will be a child\r\nno more, but a woman and an aid to thee. Listen! Give me my sitar and I\r\nwill sing bravely.’\r\n\r\nShe took the light silver-studded sitar and began a song of the great\r\nhero Rajah Rasalu. The hand failed on the strings, the tune halted,\r\nchecked, and at a low note turned off to the poor little nursery-rhyme\r\nabout the wicked crow--\r\n\r\n     And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound.\r\n     Only a penny a pound, baba--only . . .\r\n\r\nThen came the tears, and the piteous rebellion against fate till she\r\nslept, moaning a little in her sleep, with the right arm thrown clear\r\nof the body as though it protected something that was not there. It\r\nwas after this night that life became a little easier for Holden. The\r\never-present pain of loss drove him into his work, and the work repaid\r\nhim by filling up his mind for nine or ten hours a day. Ameera sat alone\r\nin the house and brooded, but grew happier when she understood that\r\nHolden was more at ease, according to the custom of women. They touched\r\nhappiness again, but this time with caution.\r\n\r\n‘It was because we loved Tota that he died. The jealousy of God was upon\r\nus,’ said Ameera. ‘I have hung up a large black jar before our window to\r\nturn the evil eye from us, and we must make no protestations of delight,\r\nbut go softly underneath the stars, lest God find us out. Is that not\r\ngood talk, worthless one?’\r\n\r\nShe had shifted the accent on the word that means ‘beloved,’ in proof\r\nof the sincerity of her purpose. But the kiss that followed the new\r\nchristening was a thing that any deity might have envied. They went\r\nabout henceforward saying, ‘It is naught, it is naught;’ and hoping that\r\nall the Powers heard.\r\n\r\nThe Powers were busy on other things. They had allowed thirty million\r\npeople four years of plenty wherein men fed well and the crops were\r\ncertain, and the birth-rate rose year by year; the districts reported a\r\npurely agricultural population varying from nine hundred to two thousand\r\nto the square mile of the overburdened earth; and the Member for Lower\r\nTooting, wandering about India in pot-hat and frock-coat, talked largely\r\nof the benefits of British rule and suggested as the one thing needful\r\nthe establishment of a duly qualified electoral system and a general\r\nbestowal of the franchise. His long-suffering hosts smiled and made him\r\nwelcome, and when he paused to admire, with pretty picked words, the\r\nblossom of the blood-red dhak-tree that had flowered untimely for a sign\r\nof what was coming, they smiled more than ever.\r\n\r\nIt was the Deputy Commissioner of Kot-Kumharsen, staying at the club for\r\na day, who lightly told a tale that made Holden’s blood run cold as he\r\noverheard the end.\r\n\r\n‘He won’t bother any one any more. Never saw a man so astonished in my\r\nlife. By Jove, I thought he meant to ask a question in the House about\r\nit. Fellow-passenger in his ship--dined next him--bowled over by cholera\r\nand died in eighteen hours. You needn’t laugh, you fellows. The Member\r\nfor Lower Tooting is awfully angry about it; but he’s more scared. I\r\nthink he’s going to take his enlightened self out of India.’\r\n\r\n‘I’d give a good deal if he were knocked over. It might keep a few\r\nvestrymen of his kidney to their own parish. But what’s this about\r\ncholera? It’s full early for anything of that kind,’ said the warden of\r\nan unprofitable salt-lick.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t know,’ said the Deputy Commissioner reflectively. ‘We’ve got\r\nlocusts with us. There’s sporadic cholera all along the north--at least\r\nwe’re calling it sporadic for decency’s sake. The spring crops are short\r\nin five districts, and nobody seems to know where the rains are. It’s\r\nnearly March now. I don’t want to scare anybody, but it seems to me that\r\nNature’s going to audit her accounts with a big red pencil this summer.’\r\n\r\n‘Just when I wanted to take leave, too!’ said a voice across the room.\r\n\r\n‘There won’t be much leave this year, but there ought to be a great\r\ndeal of promotion. I’ve come in to persuade the Government to put my pet\r\ncanal on the list of famine-relief works. It’s an ill-wind that blows no\r\ngood. I shall get that canal finished at last.’\r\n\r\n‘Is it the old programme then,’ said Holden; ‘famine, fever, and\r\ncholera?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh no. Only local scarcity and an unusual prevalence of seasonal\r\nsickness. You’ll find it all in the reports if you live till next year.\r\nYou’re a lucky chap. YOU haven’t got a wife to send out of harm’s way.\r\nThe hill-stations ought to be full of women this year.’\r\n\r\n‘I think you’re inclined to exaggerate the talk in the bazars’ said a\r\nyoung civilian in the Secretariat. ‘Now I have observed--’\r\n\r\n‘I daresay you have,’ said the Deputy Commissioner, ‘but you’ve a great\r\ndeal more to observe, my son. In the meantime, I wish to observe to\r\nyou--’ and he drew him aside to discuss the construction of the canal\r\nthat was so dear to his heart. Holden went to his bungalow and began\r\nto understand that he was not alone in the world, and also that he was\r\nafraid for the sake of another,--which is the most soul-satisfying fear\r\nknown to man.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, as the Deputy had foretold, Nature began to audit her\r\naccounts with a red pencil. On the heels of the spring-reapings came a\r\ncry for bread, and the Government, which had decreed that no man should\r\ndie of want, sent wheat. Then came the cholera from all four quarters of\r\nthe compass. It struck a pilgrim-gathering of half a million at a sacred\r\nshrine. Many died at the feet of their god; the others broke and ran\r\nover the face of the land carrying the pestilence with them. It smote a\r\nwalled city and killed two hundred a day. The people crowded the\r\ntrains, hanging on to the footboards and squatting on the roofs of\r\nthe carriages, and the cholera followed them, for at each station they\r\ndragged out the dead and the dying. They died by the roadside, and the\r\nhorses of the Englishmen shied at the corpses in the grass. The rains\r\ndid not come, and the earth turned to iron lest man should escape death\r\nby hiding in her. The English sent their wives away to the hills and\r\nwent about their work, coming forward as they were bidden to fill the\r\ngaps in the fighting-line. Holden, sick with fear of losing his chiefest\r\ntreasure on earth, had done his best to persuade Ameera to go away with\r\nher mother to the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n‘Why should I go?’ said she one evening on the roof.\r\n\r\n‘There is sickness, and people are dying, and all the white mem-log have\r\ngone.’\r\n\r\n‘All of them?’\r\n\r\n‘All--unless perhaps there remain some old scald-head who vexes her\r\nhusband’s heart by running risk of death.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay; who stays is my sister, and thou must not abuse her, for I will be\r\na scald-head too. I am glad all the bold mem-log are gone.’\r\n\r\n‘Do I speak to a woman or a babe? Go to the hills and I will see to\r\nit that thou goest like a queen’s daughter. Think, child. In a\r\nred-lacquered bullock-cart, veiled and curtained, with brass peacocks\r\nupon the pole and red cloth hangings. I will send two orderlies for\r\nguard, and--’\r\n\r\n‘Peace! Thou art the babe in speaking thus. What use are those toys to\r\nme? HE would have patted the bullocks and played with the housings. For\r\nhis sake, perhaps,--thou hast made me very English--I might have gone.\r\nNow, I will not. Let the mem-log run.’\r\n\r\n‘Their husbands are sending them, beloved.’\r\n\r\n‘Very good talk. Since when hast thou been my husband to tell me what to\r\ndo? I have but borne thee a son. Thou art only all the desire of my soul\r\nto me. How shall I depart when I know that if evil befall thee by the\r\nbreadth of so much as my littlest finger-nail--is that not small?--I\r\nshould be aware of it though I were in paradise. And here, this summer\r\nthou mayest die--ai, janee, die! and in dying they might call to tend\r\nthee a white woman, and she would rob me in the last of thy love!’\r\n\r\n‘But love is not born in a moment or on a death-bed!’\r\n\r\n‘What dost thou know of love, stoneheart? She would take thy thanks at\r\nleast and, by God and the Prophet and Beebee Miriam the mother of thy\r\nProphet, that I will never endure. My lord and my love, let there be no\r\nmore foolish talk of going away. Where thou art, I am. It is enough.’\r\nShe put an arm round his neck and a hand on his mouth.\r\n\r\nThere are not many happinesses so complete as those that are snatched\r\nunder the shadow of the sword. They sat together and laughed, calling\r\neach other openly by every pet name that could move the wrath of the\r\ngods. The city below them was locked up in its own torments. Sulphur\r\nfires blazed in the streets; the conches in the Hindu temples screamed\r\nand bellowed, for the gods were inattentive in those days. There was a\r\nservice in the great Mahomedan shrine, and the call to prayer from the\r\nminarets was almost unceasing. They heard the wailing in the houses of\r\nthe dead, and once the shriek of a mother who had lost a child and was\r\ncalling for its return. In the gray dawn they saw the dead borne\r\nout through the city gates, each litter with its own little knot of\r\nmourners. Wherefore they kissed each other and shivered.\r\n\r\nIt was a red and heavy audit, for the land was very sick and needed a\r\nlittle breathing-space ere the torrent of cheap life should flood it\r\nanew. The children of immature fathers and undeveloped mothers made no\r\nresistance. They were cowed and sat still, waiting till the sword should\r\nbe sheathed in November if it were so willed. There were gaps among\r\nthe English, but the gaps were filled. The work of superintending\r\nfamine-relief, cholera-sheds, medicine-distribution, and what little\r\nsanitation was possible, went forward because it was so ordered.\r\n\r\nHolden had been told to keep himself in readiness to move to replace the\r\nnext man who should fall. There were twelve hours in each day when he\r\ncould not see Ameera, and she might die in three. He was considering\r\nwhat his pain would be if he could not see her for three months, or\r\nif she died out of his sight. He was absolutely certain that her death\r\nwould be demanded--so certain that when he looked up from the telegram\r\nand saw Pir Khan breathless in the doorway, he laughed aloud. ‘And?’\r\nsaid he,--\r\n\r\n‘When there is a cry in the night and the spirit flutters into the\r\nthroat, who has a charm that will restore? Come swiftly, Heaven-born! It\r\nis the black cholera.’\r\n\r\nHolden galloped to his home. The sky was heavy with clouds, for the\r\nlong-deferred rains were near and the heat was stifling. Ameera’s mother\r\nmet him in the courtyard, whimpering, ‘She is dying. She is nursing\r\nherself into death. She is all but dead. What shall I do, sahib?’\r\n\r\nAmeera was lying in the room in which Tota had been born. She made no\r\nsign when Holden entered, because the human soul is a very lonely\r\nthing and, when it is getting ready to go away, hides itself in a misty\r\nborderland where the living may not follow. The black cholera does its\r\nwork quietly and without explanation. Ameera was being thrust out of\r\nlife as though the Angel of Death had himself put his hand upon her. The\r\nquick breathing seemed to show that she was either afraid or in pain,\r\nbut neither eyes nor mouth gave any answer to Holden’s kisses. There was\r\nnothing to be said or done. Holden could only wait and suffer. The first\r\ndrops of the rain began to fall on the roof, and he could hear shouts of\r\njoy in the parched city.\r\n\r\nThe soul came back a little and the lips moved. Holden bent down to\r\nlisten. ‘Keep nothing of mine,’ said Ameera. ‘Take no hair from my head.\r\nSHE would make thee burn it later on. That flame I should feel. Lower!\r\nStoop lower! Remember only that I was thine and bore thee a son. Though\r\nthou wed a white woman to-morrow, the pleasure of receiving in thy arms\r\nthy first son is taken from thee for ever. Remember me when thy son is\r\nborn--the one that shall carry thy name before all men. His misfortunes\r\nbe on my head. I bear witness--I bear witness’--the lips were forming\r\nthe words on his ear--‘that there is no God but--thee, beloved!’\r\n\r\nThen she died. Holden sat still, and all thought was taken from\r\nhim,--till he heard Ameera’s mother lift the curtain.\r\n\r\n‘Is she dead, sahib?’\r\n\r\n‘She is dead.’\r\n\r\n‘Then I will mourn, and afterwards take an inventory of the furniture in\r\nthis house. For that will be mine. The sahib does not mean to resume it?\r\nIt is so little, so very little, sahib, and I am an old woman. I would\r\nlike to lie softly.’\r\n\r\n‘For the mercy of God be silent a while. Go out and mourn where I cannot\r\nhear.’\r\n\r\n‘Sahib, she will be buried in four hours.’\r\n\r\n‘I know the custom. I shall go ere she is taken away. That matter is in\r\nthy hands. Look to it, that the bed on which--on which she lies--’\r\n\r\n‘Aha! That beautiful red-lacquered bed. I have long desired--’\r\n\r\n‘That the bed is left here untouched for my disposal. All else in the\r\nhouse is thine. Hire a cart, take everything, go hence, and before\r\nsunrise let there be nothing in this house but that which I have ordered\r\nthee to respect.’\r\n\r\n‘I am an old woman. I would stay at least for the days of mourning, and\r\nthe rains have just broken. Whither shall I go?’\r\n\r\n‘What is that to me? My order is that there is a going. The house-gear\r\nis worth a thousand rupees and my orderly shall bring thee a hundred\r\nrupees to-night.’\r\n\r\n‘That is very little. Think of the cart-hire.’\r\n\r\n‘It shall be nothing unless thou goest, and with speed. O woman, get\r\nhence and leave me with my dead!’\r\n\r\nThe mother shuffled down the staircase, and in her anxiety to take stock\r\nof the house-fittings forgot to mourn. Holden stayed by Ameera’s side\r\nand the rain roared on the roof. He could not think connectedly by\r\nreason of the noise, though he made many attempts to do so. Then four\r\nsheeted ghosts glided dripping into the room and stared at him through\r\ntheir veils. They were the washers of the dead. Holden left the room\r\nand went out to his horse. He had come in a dead, stifling calm through\r\nankle-deep dust. He found the courtyard a rain-lashed pond alive with\r\nfrogs; a torrent of yellow water ran under the gate, and a roaring wind\r\ndrove the bolts of the rain like buckshot against the mud-walls. Pir\r\nKhan was shivering in his little hut by the gate, and the horse was\r\nstamping uneasily in the water.\r\n\r\n‘I have been told the sahib’s order,’ said Pir Khan. ‘It is well. This\r\nhouse is now desolate. I go also, for my monkey-face would be a reminder\r\nof that which has been. Concerning the bed, I will bring that to thy\r\nhouse yonder in the morning; but remember, sahib, it will be to thee a\r\nknife turning in a green wound. I go upon a pilgrimage, and I will\r\ntake no money. I have grown fat in the protection of the Presence whose\r\nsorrow is my sorrow. For the last time I hold his stirrup.’\r\n\r\nHe touched Holden’s foot with both hands and the horse sprang out into\r\nthe road, where the creaking bamboos were whipping the sky and all the\r\nfrogs were chuckling. Holden could not see for the rain in his face. He\r\nput his hands before his eyes and muttered--\r\n\r\n‘Oh you brute! You utter brute!’\r\n\r\nThe news of his trouble was already in his bungalow. He read the\r\nknowledge in his butler’s eyes when Ahmed Khan brought in food, and\r\nfor the first and last time in his life laid a hand upon his master’s\r\nshoulder, saying, ‘Eat, sahib, eat. Meat is good against sorrow. I also\r\nhave known. Moreover the shadows come and go, sahib; the shadows come\r\nand go. These be curried eggs.’\r\n\r\nHolden could neither eat nor sleep. The heavens sent down eight inches\r\nof rain in that night and washed the earth clean. The waters tore down\r\nwalls, broke roads, and scoured open the shallow graves on the Mahomedan\r\nburying-ground. All next day it rained, and Holden sat still in his\r\nhouse considering his sorrow. On the morning of the third day he\r\nreceived a telegram which said only, ‘Ricketts, Myndonie. Dying. Holden\r\nrelieve. Immediate.’ Then he thought that before he departed he would\r\nlook at the house wherein he had been master and lord. There was a break\r\nin the weather, and the rank earth steamed with vapour.\r\n\r\nHe found that the rains had torn down the mud pillars of the gateway,\r\nand the heavy wooden gate that had guarded his life hung lazily from one\r\nhinge. There was grass three inches high in the courtyard; Pir Khan’s\r\nlodge was empty, and the sodden thatch sagged between the beams. A gray\r\nsquirrel was in possession of the verandah, as if the house had been\r\nuntenanted for thirty years instead of three days. Ameera’s mother had\r\nremoved everything except some mildewed matting. The tick-tick of the\r\nlittle scorpions as they hurried across the floor was the only sound\r\nin the house. Ameera’s room and the other one where Tota had lived were\r\nheavy with mildew; and the narrow staircase leading to the roof was\r\nstreaked and stained with rain-borne mud. Holden saw all these\r\nthings, and came out again to meet in the road Durga Dass, his\r\nlandlord,--portly, affable, clothed in white muslin, and driving a\r\nCee-spring buggy. He was overlooking his property to see how the roofs\r\nstood the stress of the first rains.\r\n\r\n‘I have heard,’ said he, ‘you will not take this place any more, sahib?’\r\n\r\n‘What are you going to do with it?’\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps I shall let it again.’\r\n\r\n‘Then I will keep it on while I am away.’\r\n\r\nDurga Dass was silent for some time. ‘You shall not take it on, sahib,’\r\nhe said. ‘When I was a young man I also--, but to-day I am a member of\r\nthe Municipality. Ho! Ho! No. When the birds have gone what need to keep\r\nthe nest? I will have it pulled down--the timber will sell for something\r\nalways. It shall be pulled down, and the Municipality shall make a road\r\nacross, as they desire, from the burning-ghat to the city wall, so that\r\nno man may say where this house stood.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF THE PASSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n The sky is lead and our faces are red,\r\n And the gates of Hell are opened and riven,\r\n And the winds of Hell are loosened and driven,\r\n And the dust flies up in the face of Heaven,\r\n And the clouds come down in a fiery sheet,\r\n Heavy to raise and hard to be borne.\r\n And the soul of man is turned from his meat,\r\n Turned from the trifles for which he has striven\r\n Sick in his body, and heavy hearted,\r\n And his soul flies up like the dust in the sheet\r\n Breaks from his flesh and is gone and departed,\r\n As the blasts they blow on the cholera-horn.\r\n                            HIMALAYAN.\r\n\r\nFour men, each entitled to ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness,’ sat at a table playing whist. The thermometer marked--for\r\nthem--one hundred and one degrees of heat. The room was darkened till it\r\nwas only just possible to distinguish the pips of the cards and the very\r\nwhite faces of the players. A tattered, rotten punkah of whitewashed\r\ncalico was puddling the hot air and whining dolefully at each stroke.\r\nOutside lay gloom of a November day in London. There was neither sky,\r\nsun, nor horizon,--nothing but a brown purple haze of heat. It was as\r\nthough the earth were dying of apoplexy.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time clouds of tawny dust rose from the ground without\r\nwind or warning, flung themselves tablecloth-wise among the tops of the\r\nparched trees, and came down again. Then a whirling dust-devil would\r\nscutter across the plain for a couple of miles, break, and fall outward,\r\nthough there was nothing to check its flight save a long low line of\r\npiled railway-sleepers white with the dust, a cluster of huts made of\r\nmud, condemned rails, and canvas, and the one squat four-roomed bungalow\r\nthat belonged to the assistant engineer in charge of a section of the\r\nGaudhari State line then under construction.\r\n\r\nThe four, stripped to the thinnest of sleeping-suits, played whist\r\ncrossly, with wranglings as to leads and returns. It was not the best\r\nkind of whist, but they had taken some trouble to arrive at it. Mottram\r\nof the Indian Survey had ridden thirty and railed one hundred miles from\r\nhis lonely post in the desert since the night before; Lowndes of the\r\nCivil Service, on special duty in the political department, had come as\r\nfar to escape for an instant the miserable intrigues of an impoverished\r\nnative State whose king alternately fawned and blustered for more\r\nmoney from the pitiful revenues contributed by hard-wrung peasants and\r\ndespairing camel-breeders; Spurstow, the doctor of the line, had left\r\na cholera-stricken camp of coolies to look after itself for forty-eight\r\nhours while he associated with white men once more. Hummil, the\r\nassistant engineer, was the host. He stood fast and received his friends\r\nthus every Sunday if they could come in. When one of them failed to\r\nappear, he would send a telegram to his last address, in order that he\r\nmight know whether the defaulter were dead or alive. There are very\r\nmany places in the East where it is not good or kind to let your\r\nacquaintances drop out of sight even for one short week.\r\n\r\nThe players were not conscious of any special regard for each other.\r\nThey squabbled whenever they met; but they ardently desired to meet, as\r\nmen without water desire to drink. They were lonely folk who understood\r\nthe dread meaning of loneliness. They were all under thirty years of\r\nage,--which is too soon for any man to possess that knowledge.\r\n\r\n‘Pilsener?’ said Spurstow, after the second rubber, mopping his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n‘Beer’s out, I’m sorry to say, and there’s hardly enough soda-water for\r\nto-night,’ said Hummil.\r\n\r\n‘What filthy bad management!’ Spurstow snarled.\r\n\r\n‘Can’t help it. I’ve written and wired; but the trains don’t come\r\nthrough regularly yet. Last week the ice ran out,--as Lowndes knows.’\r\n\r\n‘Glad I didn’t come. I could ha’ sent you some if I had known, though.\r\nPhew! it’s too hot to go on playing bumblepuppy.’ This with a savage\r\nscowl at Lowndes, who only laughed. He was a hardened offender.\r\n\r\nMottram rose from the table and looked out of a chink in the shutters.\r\n\r\n‘What a sweet day!’ said he.\r\n\r\nThe company yawned all together and betook themselves to an aimless\r\ninvestigation of all Hummil’s possessions,--guns, tattered novels,\r\nsaddlery, spurs, and the like. They had fingered them a score of times\r\nbefore, but there was really nothing else to do.\r\n\r\n‘Got anything fresh?’ said Lowndes.\r\n\r\n‘Last week’s Gazette of India, and a cutting from a home paper. My\r\nfather sent it out. It’s rather amusing.’\r\n\r\n‘One of those vestrymen that call ‘emselves M.P.’s again, is it?’ said\r\nSpurstow, who read his newspapers when he could get them.\r\n\r\n‘Yes. Listen to this. It’s to your address, Lowndes. The man was making\r\na speech to his constituents, and he piled it on. Here’s a sample:\r\n“And I assert unhesitatingly that the Civil Service in India is the\r\npreserve--the pet preserve--of the aristocracy of England. What does the\r\ndemocracy--what do the masses--get from that country, which we have step\r\nby step fraudulently annexed? I answer, nothing whatever. It is\r\nfarmed with a single eye to their own interests by the scions of the\r\naristocracy. They take good care to maintain their lavish scale of\r\nincomes, to avoid or stifle any inquiries into the nature and conduct of\r\ntheir administration, while they themselves force the unhappy peasant\r\nto pay with the sweat of his brow for all the luxuries in which they are\r\nlapped.”’ Hummil waved the cutting above his head. ‘’Ear! ‘ear!’ said\r\nhis audience.\r\n\r\nThen Lowndes, meditatively: ‘I’d give--I’d give three months’ pay to\r\nhave that gentleman spend one month with me and see how the free and\r\nindependent native prince works things. Old Timbersides’--this was his\r\nflippant title for an honoured and decorated feudatory prince--‘has\r\nbeen wearing my life out this week past for money. By Jove, his latest\r\nperformance was to send me one of his women as a bribe!’\r\n\r\n‘Good for you! Did you accept it?’ said Mottram.\r\n\r\n‘No. I rather wish I had, now. She was a pretty little person, and\r\nshe yarned away to me about the horrible destitution among the king’s\r\nwomen-folk. The darlings haven’t had any new clothes for nearly a month,\r\nand the old man wants to buy a new drag from Calcutta,--solid silver\r\nrailings and silver lamps, and trifles of that kind. I’ve tried to make\r\nhim understand that he has played the deuce with the revenues for the\r\nlast twenty years and must go slow. He can’t see it.’\r\n\r\n‘But he has the ancestral treasure-vaults to draw on. There must be\r\nthree millions at least in jewels and coin under his palace,’ said\r\nHummil.\r\n\r\n‘Catch a native king disturbing the family treasure! The priests forbid\r\nit except as the last resort. Old Timbersides has added something like a\r\nquarter of a million to the deposit in his reign.’\r\n\r\n‘Where the mischief does it all come from?’ said Mottram.\r\n\r\n‘The country. The state of the people is enough to make you sick. I’ve\r\nknown the tax-men wait by a milch-camel till the foal was born and then\r\nhurry off the mother for arrears. And what can I do? I can’t get the\r\ncourt clerks to give me any accounts; I can’t raise anything more than\r\na fat smile from the commander-in-chief when I find out the troops are\r\nthree months in arrears; and old Timbersides begins to weep when I speak\r\nto him. He has taken to the King’s Peg heavily,--liqueur brandy for\r\nwhisky, and Heidsieck for soda-water.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s what the Rao of Jubela took to. Even a native can’t last long at\r\nthat,’ said Spurstow. ‘He’ll go out.’\r\n\r\n‘And a good thing, too. Then I suppose we’ll have a council of regency,\r\nand a tutor for the young prince, and hand him back his kingdom with ten\r\nyears’ accumulations.’\r\n\r\n‘Whereupon that young prince, having been taught all the vices of the\r\nEnglish, will play ducks and drakes with the money and undo ten years’\r\nwork in eighteen months. I’ve seen that business before,’ said Spurstow.\r\n‘I should tackle the king with a light hand, if I were you, Lowndes.\r\nThey’ll hate you quite enough under any circumstances.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s all very well. The man who looks on can talk about the light\r\nhand; but you can’t clean a pig-stye with a pen dipped in rose-water. I\r\nknow my risks; but nothing has happened yet. My servant’s an old Pathan,\r\nand he cooks for me. They are hardly likely to bribe him, and I don’t\r\naccept food from my true friends, as they call themselves. Oh, but it’s\r\nweary work! I’d sooner be with you, Spurstow. There’s shooting near your\r\ncamp.’\r\n\r\n‘Would you? I don’t think it. About fifteen deaths a day don’t incite a\r\nman to shoot anything but himself. And the worst of it is that the poor\r\ndevils look at you as though you ought to save them. Lord knows, I’ve\r\ntried everything. My last attempt was empirical, but it pulled an old\r\nman through. He was brought to me apparently past hope, and I gave\r\nhim gin and Worcester sauce with cayenne. It cured him; but I don’t\r\nrecommend it.’\r\n\r\n‘How do the cases run generally?’ said Hummil.\r\n\r\n‘Very simply indeed. Chlorodyne, opium pill, chlorodyne, collapse,\r\nnitre, bricks to the feet, and then--the burning-ghat. The last seems to\r\nbe the only thing that stops the trouble. It’s black cholera, you know.\r\nPoor devils! But, I will say, little Bunsee Lal, my apothecary, works\r\nlike a demon. I’ve recommended him for promotion if he comes through it\r\nall alive.’\r\n\r\n‘And what are your chances, old man?’ said Mottram.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t know; don’t care much; but I’ve sent the letter in. What are you\r\ndoing with yourself generally?’\r\n\r\n‘Sitting under a table in the tent and spitting on the sextant to\r\nkeep it cool,’ said the man of the survey. ‘Washing my eyes to\r\navoid ophthalmia, which I shall certainly get, and trying to make a\r\nsub-surveyor understand that an error of five degrees in an angle isn’t\r\nquite so small as it looks. I’m altogether alone, y’ know, and shall be\r\ntill the end of the hot weather.’\r\n\r\n‘Hummil’s the lucky man,’ said Lowndes, flinging himself into a long\r\nchair. ‘He has an actual roof--torn as to the ceiling-cloth, but still\r\na roof--over his head. He sees one train daily. He can get beer and\r\nsoda-water and ice ‘em when God is good. He has books, pictures,---they\r\nwere torn from the Graphic,--‘and the society of the excellent\r\nsub-contractor Jevins, besides the pleasure of receiving us weekly.’\r\n\r\nHummil smiled grimly. ‘Yes, I’m the lucky man, I suppose. Jevins is\r\nluckier.’\r\n\r\n‘How? Not----’\r\n\r\n‘Yes. Went out. Last Monday.’\r\n\r\n‘By his own hand?’ said Spurstow quickly, hinting the suspicion that was\r\nin everybody’s mind. There was no cholera near Hummil’s section. Even\r\nfever gives a man at least a week’s grace, and sudden death generally\r\nimplied self-slaughter.\r\n\r\n‘I judge no man this weather,’ said Hummil. ‘He had a touch of the sun,\r\nI fancy; for last week, after you fellows had left, he came into the\r\nverandah and told me that he was going home to see his wife, in Market\r\nStreet, Liverpool, that evening.\r\n\r\n‘I got the apothecary in to look at him, and we tried to make him lie\r\ndown. After an hour or two he rubbed his eyes and said he believed he\r\nhad had a fit,--hoped he hadn’t said anything rude. Jevins had a great\r\nidea of bettering himself socially. He was very like Chucks in his\r\nlanguage.’\r\n\r\n‘Well?’\r\n\r\n‘Then he went to his own bungalow and began cleaning a rifle. He told\r\nthe servant that he was going to shoot buck in the morning. Naturally\r\nhe fumbled with the trigger, and shot himself through the\r\nhead--accidentally. The apothecary sent in a report to my chief, and\r\nJevins is buried somewhere out there. I’d have wired to you, Spurstow,\r\nif you could have done anything.’\r\n\r\n‘You’re a queer chap,’ said Mottram. ‘If you’d killed the man yourself\r\nyou couldn’t have been more quiet about the business.’\r\n\r\n‘Good Lord! what does it matter?’ said Hummil calmly. ‘I’ve got to do\r\na lot of his overseeing work in addition to my own. I’m the only person\r\nthat suffers. Jevins is out of it,--by pure accident, of course, but out\r\nof it. The apothecary was going to write a long screed on suicide. Trust\r\na babu to drivel when he gets the chance.’\r\n\r\n‘Why didn’t you let it go in as suicide?’ said Lowndes.\r\n\r\n‘No direct proof. A man hasn’t many privileges in this country, but he\r\nmight at least be allowed to mishandle his own rifle. Besides, some day\r\nI may need a man to smother up an accident to myself. Live and let live.\r\nDie and let die.’\r\n\r\n‘You take a pill,’ said Spurstow, who had been watching Hummil’s white\r\nface narrowly. ‘Take a pill, and don’t be an ass. That sort of talk is\r\nskittles. Anyhow, suicide is shirking your work. If I were Job ten times\r\nover, I should be so interested in what was going to happen next that\r\nI’d stay on and watch.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! I’ve lost that curiosity,’ said Hummil.\r\n\r\n‘Liver out of order?’ said Lowndes feelingly.\r\n\r\n‘No. Can’t sleep. That’s worse.’\r\n\r\n‘By Jove, it is!’ said Mottram. ‘I’m that way every now and then, and\r\nthe fit has to wear itself out. What do you take for it?’\r\n\r\n‘Nothing. What’s the use? I haven’t had ten minutes’ sleep since Friday\r\nmorning.’\r\n\r\n‘Poor chap! Spurstow, you ought to attend to this,’ said Mottram. ‘Now\r\nyou mention it, your eyes are rather gummy and swollen.’\r\n\r\nSpurstow, still watching Hummil, laughed lightly. ‘I’ll patch him up,\r\nlater on. Is it too hot, do you think, to go for a ride?’\r\n\r\n‘Where to?’ said Lowndes wearily. ‘We shall have to go away at eight,\r\nand there’ll be riding enough for us then. I hate a horse, when I have\r\nto use him as a necessity. Oh, heavens! what is there to do?’\r\n\r\n‘Begin whist again, at chick points [‘a chick’ is supposed to be eight\r\nshillings] and a gold mohur on the rub,’ said Spurstow promptly.\r\n\r\n‘Poker. A month’s pay all round for the pool,--no limit,--and\r\nfifty-rupee raises. Somebody would be broken before we got up,’ said\r\nLowndes.\r\n\r\n‘Can’t say that it would give me any pleasure to break any man in this\r\ncompany,’ said Mottram. ‘There isn’t enough excitement in it, and\r\nit’s foolish.’ He crossed over to the worn and battered little\r\ncamp-piano,--wreckage of a married household that had once held the\r\nbungalow,--and opened the case.\r\n\r\n‘It’s used up long ago,’ said Hummil. ‘The servants have picked it to\r\npieces.’\r\n\r\nThe piano was indeed hopelessly out of order, but Mottram managed to\r\nbring the rebellious notes into a sort of agreement, and there rose from\r\nthe ragged keyboard something that might once have been the ghost of a\r\npopular music-hall song. The men in the long chairs turned with evident\r\ninterest as Mottram banged the more lustily.\r\n\r\n‘That’s good!’ said Lowndes. ‘By Jove! the last time I heard that song\r\nwas in ‘79, or thereabouts, just before I came out.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!’ said Spurstow with pride,’ I was home in ‘80.’ And he mentioned a\r\nsong of the streets popular at that date.\r\n\r\nMottram executed it roughly. Lowndes criticised and volunteered\r\nemendations. Mottram dashed into another ditty, not of the music-hall\r\ncharacter, and made as if to rise.\r\n\r\n‘Sit down,’ said Hummil. ‘I didn’t know that you had any music in your\r\ncomposition. Go on playing until you can’t think of anything more. I’ll\r\nhave that piano tuned up before you come again. Play something festive.’\r\n\r\nVery simple indeed were the tunes to which Mottram’s art and the\r\nlimitations of the piano could give effect, but the men listened with\r\npleasure, and in the pauses talked all together of what they had seen or\r\nheard when they were last at home. A dense dust-storm sprung up outside,\r\nand swept roaring over the house, enveloping it in the choking darkness\r\nof midnight, but Mottram continued unheeding, and the crazy tinkle\r\nreached the ears of the listeners above the flapping of the tattered\r\nceiling-cloth.\r\n\r\nIn the silence after the storm he glided from the more directly personal\r\nsongs of Scotland, half humming them as he played, into the Evening\r\nHymn.\r\n\r\n‘Sunday,’ said he, nodding his head.\r\n\r\n‘Go on. Don’t apologise for it,’ said Spurstow.\r\n\r\nHummil laughed long and riotously. ‘Play it, by all means. You’re full\r\nof surprises to-day. I didn’t know you had such a gift of finished\r\nsarcasm. How does that thing go?’\r\n\r\nMottram took up the tune.\r\n\r\n‘Too slow by half. You miss the note of gratitude,’ said Hummil. ‘It\r\nought to go to the “Grasshopper’s Polka,”--this way.’ And he chanted,\r\nprestissimo,--\r\n\r\n‘Glory to thee, my God, this night. For all the blessings of the light.\r\n\r\nThat shows we really feel our blessings. How does it go on?--\r\n\r\n‘If in the night I sleepless lie, My soul with sacred thoughts supply;\r\nMay no ill dreams disturb my rest.’--\r\n\r\nQuicker, Mottram!--\r\n\r\n‘Or powers of darkness me molest!’\r\n\r\n‘Bah! what an old hypocrite you are!’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t be an ass,’ said Lowndes. ‘You are at full liberty to make fun of\r\nanything else you like, but leave that hymn alone. It’s associated in my\r\nmind with the most sacred recollections----’\r\n\r\n‘Summer evenings in the country,--stained-glass window,--light going\r\nout, and you and she jamming your heads together over one hymn-book,’\r\nsaid Mottram.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, and a fat old cockchafer hitting you in the eye when you walked\r\nhome. Smell of hay, and a moon as big as a bandbox sitting on the top of\r\na haycock; bats,--roses,--milk and midges,’ said Lowndes.\r\n\r\n‘Also mothers. I can just recollect my mother singing me to sleep with\r\nthat when I was a little chap,’ said Spurstow.\r\n\r\nThe darkness had fallen on the room. They could hear Hummil squirming in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n‘Consequently,’ said he testily, ‘you sing it when you are seven fathom\r\ndeep in Hell! It’s an insult to the intelligence of the Deity to pretend\r\nwe’re anything but tortured rebels.’\r\n\r\n‘Take TWO pills,’ said Spurstow; ‘that’s tortured liver.’\r\n\r\n‘The usually placid Hummil is in a vile bad temper. I’m sorry for his\r\ncoolies to-morrow,’ said Lowndes, as the servants brought in the lights\r\nand prepared the table for dinner.\r\n\r\nAs they were settling into their places about the miserable goat-chops,\r\nand the smoked tapioca pudding, Spurstow took occasion to whisper to\r\nMottram, ‘Well done, David!’\r\n\r\n‘Look after Saul, then,’ was the reply.\r\n\r\n‘What are you two whispering about?’ said Hummil suspiciously.\r\n\r\n‘Only saying that you are a damned poor host. This fowl can’t be cut,’\r\nreturned Spurstow with a sweet smile. ‘Call this a dinner?’\r\n\r\n‘I can’t help it. You don’t expect a banquet, do you?’\r\n\r\nThroughout that meal Hummil contrived laboriously to insult directly\r\nand pointedly all his guests in succession, and at each insult Spurstow\r\nkicked the aggrieved persons under the table; but he dared not exchange\r\na glance of intelligence with either of them. Hummil’s face was white\r\nand pinched, while his eyes were unnaturally large. No man dreamed for\r\na moment of resenting his savage personalities, but as soon as the meal\r\nwas over they made haste to get away. ‘Don’t go. You’re just getting\r\namusing, you fellows. I hope I haven’t said anything that annoyed you.\r\nYou’re such touchy devils.’ Then, changing the note into one of almost\r\nabject entreaty, Hummil added, ‘I say, you surely aren’t going?’\r\n\r\n‘In the language of the blessed Jorrocks, where I dines I sleeps,’ said\r\nSpurstow. ‘I want to have a look at your coolies to-morrow, if you don’t\r\nmind. You can give me a place to lie down in, I suppose?’\r\n\r\nThe others pleaded the urgency of their several duties next day, and,\r\nsaddling up, departed together, Hummil begging them to come next Sunday.\r\nAs they jogged off, Lowndes unbosomed himself to Mottram--\r\n\r\n‘... And I never felt so like kicking a man at his own table in my life.\r\nHe said I cheated at whist, and reminded me I was in debt! ‘Told you you\r\nwere as good as a liar to your face! You aren’t half indignant enough\r\nover it.’\r\n\r\n‘Not I,’ said Mottram. ‘Poor devil! Did you ever know old Hummy behave\r\nlike that before or within a hundred miles of it?’\r\n\r\n‘That’s no excuse. Spurstow was hacking my shin all the time, so I kept\r\na hand on myself. Else I should have--’\r\n\r\n‘No, you wouldn’t. You’d have done as Hummy did about Jevins; judge no\r\nman this weather. By Jove! the buckle of my bridle is hot in my hand!\r\nTrot out a bit, and ‘ware rat-holes.’\r\n\r\nTen minutes’ trotting jerked out of Lowndes one very sage remark when he\r\npulled up, sweating from every pore--\r\n\r\n‘’Good thing Spurstow’s with him to-night.’\r\n\r\n‘Ye-es. Good man, Spurstow. Our roads turn here. See you again next\r\nSunday, if the sun doesn’t bowl me over.’\r\n\r\n‘S’pose so, unless old Timbersides’ finance minister manages to dress\r\nsome of my food. Good-night, and--God bless you!’\r\n\r\n‘What’s wrong now?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, nothing.’ Lowndes gathered up his whip, and, as he flicked\r\nMottram’s mare on the flank, added, ‘You’re not a bad little\r\nchap,--that’s all.’ And the mare bolted half a mile across the sand, on\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nIn the assistant engineer’s bungalow Spurstow and Hummil smoked the pipe\r\nof silence together, each narrowly watching the other. The capacity of a\r\nbachelor’s establishment is as elastic as its arrangements are simple. A\r\nservant cleared away the dining-room table, brought in a couple of rude\r\nnative bedsteads made of tape strung on a light wood frame, flung a\r\nsquare of cool Calcutta matting over each, set them side by side, pinned\r\ntwo towels to the punkah so that their fringes should just sweep clear\r\nof the sleepers’ nose and mouth, and announced that the couches were\r\nready.\r\n\r\nThe men flung themselves down, ordering the punkah-coolies by all the\r\npowers of Hell to pull. Every door and window was shut, for the outside\r\nair was that of an oven. The atmosphere within was only 104 degrees,\r\nas the thermometer bore witness, and heavy with the foul smell of\r\nbadly-trimmed kerosene lamps; and this stench, combined with that of\r\nnative tobacco, baked brick, and dried earth, sends the heart of many\r\na strong man down to his boots, for it is the smell of the Great Indian\r\nEmpire when she turns herself for six months into a house of torment.\r\nSpurstow packed his pillows craftily so that he reclined rather than\r\nlay, his head at a safe elevation above his feet. It is not good\r\nto sleep on a low pillow in the hot weather if you happen to be of\r\nthick-necked build, for you may pass with lively snores and gugglings\r\nfrom natural sleep into the deep slumber of heat-apoplexy.\r\n\r\n‘Pack your pillows,’ said the doctor sharply, as he saw Hummil preparing\r\nto lie down at full length.\r\n\r\nThe night-light was trimmed; the shadow of the punkah wavered across the\r\nroom, and the ‘flick’ of the punkah-towel and the soft whine of the\r\nrope through the wall-hole followed it. Then the punkah flagged, almost\r\nceased. The sweat poured from Spurstow’s brow. Should he go out and\r\nharangue the coolie? It started forward again with a savage jerk, and\r\na pin came out of the towels. When this was replaced, a tomtom in the\r\ncoolie-lines began to beat with the steady throb of a swollen artery\r\ninside some brain-fevered skull. Spurstow turned on his side and swore\r\ngently. There was no movement on Hummil’s part. The man had composed\r\nhimself as rigidly as a corpse, his hands clinched at his sides. The\r\nrespiration was too hurried for any suspicion of sleep. Spurstow looked\r\nat the set face. The jaws were clinched, and there was a pucker round\r\nthe quivering eyelids.\r\n\r\n‘He’s holding himself as tightly as ever he can,’ thought Spurstow.\r\n‘What in the world is the matter with him?--Hummil!’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ in a thick constrained voice.\r\n\r\n‘Can’t you get to sleep?’\r\n\r\n‘No.’\r\n\r\n‘Head hot? ‘Throat feeling bulgy? or how?’\r\n\r\n‘Neither, thanks. I don’t sleep much, you know.’\r\n\r\n‘Feel pretty bad?’\r\n\r\n‘Pretty bad, thanks. There is a tomtom outside, isn’t there? I thought\r\nit was my head at first.... Oh, Spurstow, for pity’s sake give me\r\nsomething that will put me asleep,--sound asleep,--if it’s only for six\r\nhours!’ He sprang up, trembling from head to foot. ‘I haven’t been able\r\nto sleep naturally for days, and I can’t stand it!--I can’t stand it!’\r\n\r\n‘Poor old chap!’\r\n\r\n‘That’s no use. Give me something to make me sleep. I tell you I’m\r\nnearly mad. I don’t know what I say half my time. For three weeks I’ve\r\nhad to think and spell out every word that has come through my lips\r\nbefore I dared say it. Isn’t that enough to drive a man mad? I can’t see\r\nthings correctly now, and I’ve lost my sense of touch. My skin aches--my\r\nskin aches! Make me sleep. Oh, Spurstow, for the love of God make me\r\nsleep sound. It isn’t enough merely to let me dream. Let me sleep!’\r\n\r\n‘All right, old man, all right. Go slow; you aren’t half as bad as you\r\nthink.’\r\n\r\nThe flood-gates of reserve once broken, Hummil was clinging to him like\r\na frightened child. ‘You’re pinching my arm to pieces.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ll break your neck if you don’t do something for me. No, I didn’t\r\nmean that. Don’t be angry, old fellow.’ He wiped the sweat off himself\r\nas he fought to regain composure. ‘I’m a bit restless and off my oats,\r\nand perhaps you could recommend some sort of sleeping mixture,--bromide\r\nof potassium.’\r\n\r\n‘Bromide of skittles! Why didn’t you tell me this before? Let go of my\r\narm, and I’ll see if there’s anything in my cigarette-case to suit your\r\ncomplaint.’ Spurstow hunted among his day-clothes, turned up the lamp,\r\nopened a little silver cigarette-case, and advanced on the expectant\r\nHummil with the daintiest of fairy squirts.\r\n\r\n‘The last appeal of civilisation,’ said he, ‘and a thing I hate to use.\r\nHold out your arm. Well, your sleeplessness hasn’t ruined your\r\nmuscle; and what a thick hide it is! Might as well inject a buffalo\r\nsubcutaneously. Now in a few minutes the morphia will begin working. Lie\r\ndown and wait.’\r\n\r\nA smile of unalloyed and idiotic delight began to creep over Hummil’s\r\nface. ‘I think,’ he whispered,--‘I think I’m going off now. Gad! it’s\r\npositively heavenly! Spurstow, you must give me that case to keep;\r\nyou--’ The voice ceased as the head fell back.\r\n\r\n‘Not for a good deal,’ said Spurstow to the unconscious form. ‘And now,\r\nmy friend, sleeplessness of your kind being very apt to relax the moral\r\nfibre in little matters of life and death, I’ll just take the liberty of\r\nspiking your guns.’\r\n\r\nHe paddled into Hummil’s saddle-room in his bare feet and uncased a\r\ntwelve-bore rifle, an express, and a revolver. Of the first he unscrewed\r\nthe nipples and hid them in the bottom of a saddlery-case; of the second\r\nhe abstracted the lever, kicking it behind a big wardrobe. The third he\r\nmerely opened, and knocked the doll-head bolt of the grip up with the\r\nheel of a riding-boot.\r\n\r\n‘That’s settled,’ he said, as he shook the sweat off his hands. ‘These\r\nlittle precautions will at least give you time to turn. You have too\r\nmuch sympathy with gun-room accidents.’\r\n\r\nAnd as he rose from his knees, the thick muffled voice of Hummil cried\r\nin the doorway, ‘You fool!’\r\n\r\nSuch tones they use who speak in the lucid intervals of delirium to\r\ntheir friends a little before they die.\r\n\r\nSpurstow started, dropping the pistol. Hummil stood in the doorway,\r\nrocking with helpless laughter.\r\n\r\n‘That was awf’ly good of you, I’m sure,’ he said, very slowly, feeling\r\nfor his words. ‘I don’t intend to go out by my own hand at present. I\r\nsay, Spurstow, that stuff won’t work. What shall I do? What shall I do?’\r\nAnd panic terror stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\n‘Lie down and give it a chance. Lie down at once.’\r\n\r\n‘I daren’t. It will only take me half-way again, and I shan’t be able to\r\nget away this time. Do you know it was all I could do to come out just\r\nnow? Generally I am as quick as lightning; but you had clogged my feet.\r\nI was nearly caught.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh yes, I understand. Go and lie down.’\r\n\r\n‘No, it isn’t delirium; but it was an awfully mean trick to play on me.\r\nDo you know I might have died?’\r\n\r\nAs a sponge rubs a slate clean, so some power unknown to Spurstow had\r\nwiped out of Hummil’s face all that stamped it for the face of a man,\r\nand he stood at the doorway in the expression of his lost innocence. He\r\nhad slept back into terrified childhood.\r\n\r\n‘Is he going to die on the spot?’ thought Spurstow. Then, aloud, ‘All\r\nright, my son. Come back to bed, and tell me all about it. You couldn’t\r\nsleep; but what was all the rest of the nonsense?’\r\n\r\n‘A place,--a place down there,’ said Hummil, with simple sincerity. The\r\ndrug was acting on him by waves, and he was flung from the fear of a\r\nstrong man to the fright of a child as his nerves gathered sense or were\r\ndulled.\r\n\r\n‘Good God! I’ve been afraid of it for months past, Spurstow. It has\r\nmade every night hell to me; and yet I’m not conscious of having done\r\nanything wrong.’\r\n\r\n‘Be still, and I’ll give you another dose. We’ll stop your nightmares,\r\nyou unutterable idiot!’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but you must give me so much that I can’t get away. You must make\r\nme quite sleepy,--not just a little sleepy. It’s so hard to run then.’\r\n\r\n‘I know it; I know it. I’ve felt it myself. The symptoms are exactly as\r\nyou describe.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, don’t laugh at me, confound you! Before this awful sleeplessness\r\ncame to me I’ve tried to rest on my elbow and put a spur in the bed to\r\nsting me when I fell back. Look!’\r\n\r\n‘By Jove! the man has been rowelled like a horse! Ridden by the\r\nnightmare with a vengeance! And we all thought him sensible enough.\r\nHeaven send us understanding! You like to talk, don’t you?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sometimes. Not when I’m frightened. THEN I want to run. Don’t\r\nyou?’\r\n\r\n‘Always. Before I give you your second dose try to tell me exactly what\r\nyour trouble is.’\r\n\r\nHummil spoke in broken whispers for nearly ten minutes, whilst Spurstow\r\nlooked into the pupils of his eyes and passed his hand before them once\r\nor twice.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the narrative the silver cigarette-case was produced,\r\nand the last words that Hummil said as he fell back for the second time\r\nwere, ‘Put me quite to sleep; for if I’m caught I die,--I die!’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes; we all do that sooner or later,--thank Heaven who has set a\r\nterm to our miseries,’ said Spurstow, settling the cushions under the\r\nhead. ‘It occurs to me that unless I drink something I shall go out\r\nbefore my time. I’ve stopped sweating, and--I wear a seventeen-inch\r\ncollar.’ He brewed himself scalding hot tea, which is an excellent\r\nremedy against heat-apoplexy if you take three or four cups of it in\r\ntime. Then he watched the sleeper.\r\n\r\n‘A blind face that cries and can’t wipe its eyes, a blind face that\r\nchases him down corridors! H’m! Decidedly, Hummil ought to go on leave\r\nas soon as possible; and, sane or otherwise, he undoubtedly did rowel\r\nhimself most cruelly. Well, Heaven send us understanding!’\r\n\r\nAt mid-day Hummil rose, with an evil taste in his mouth, but an\r\nunclouded eye and a joyful heart.\r\n\r\n‘I was pretty bad last night, wasn’t I?’ said he.\r\n\r\n‘I have seen healthier men. You must have had a touch of the sun. Look\r\nhere: if I write you a swingeing medical certificate, will you apply for\r\nleave on the spot?’\r\n\r\n‘No.’\r\n\r\n‘Why not? You want it.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but I can hold on till the weather’s a little cooler.’\r\n\r\n‘Why should you, if you can get relieved on the spot?’\r\n\r\n‘Burkett is the only man who could be sent; and he’s a born fool.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, never mind about the line. You aren’t so important as all that.\r\nWire for leave, if necessary.’\r\n\r\nHummil looked very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n‘I can hold on till the Rains,’ he said evasively.\r\n\r\n‘You can’t. Wire to headquarters for Burkett.’\r\n\r\n‘I won’t. If you want to know why, particularly, Burkett is married,\r\nand his wife’s just had a kid, and she’s up at Simla, in the cool, and\r\nBurkett has a very nice billet that takes him into Simla from Saturday\r\nto Monday. That little woman isn’t at all well. If Burkett was\r\ntransferred she’d try to follow him. If she left the baby behind she’d\r\nfret herself to death. If she came,--and Burkett’s one of those selfish\r\nlittle beasts who are always talking about a wife’s place being with her\r\nhusband,--she’d die. It’s murder to bring a woman here just now. Burkett\r\nhasn’t the physique of a rat. If he came here he’d go out; and I know\r\nshe hasn’t any money, and I’m pretty sure she’d go out too. I’m salted\r\nin a sort of way, and I’m not married. Wait till the Rains, and then\r\nBurkett can get thin down here. It’ll do him heaps of good.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you mean to say that you intend to face--what you have faced, till\r\nthe Rains break?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, it won’t be so bad, now you’ve shown me a way out of it. I can\r\nalways wire to you. Besides, now I’ve once got into the way of sleeping,\r\nit’ll be all right. Anyhow, I shan’t put in for leave. That’s the long\r\nand the short of it.’\r\n\r\n‘My great Scott! I thought all that sort of thing was dead and done\r\nwith.’\r\n\r\n‘Bosh! You’d do the same yourself. I feel a new man, thanks to that\r\ncigarette-case. You’re going over to camp now, aren’t you?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes; but I’ll try to look you up every other day, if I can.’\r\n\r\n‘I’m not bad enough for that. I don’t want you to bother. Give the\r\ncoolies gin and ketchup.’\r\n\r\n‘Then you feel all right?’\r\n\r\n‘Fit to fight for my life, but not to stand out in the sun talking to\r\nyou. Go along, old man, and bless you!’\r\n\r\nHummil turned on his heel to face the echoing desolation of his\r\nbungalow, and the first thing he saw standing in the verandah was the\r\nfigure of himself. He had met a similar apparition once before, when he\r\nwas suffering from overwork and the strain of the hot weather.\r\n\r\n‘This is bad,--already,’ he said, rubbing his eyes. ‘If the thing slides\r\naway from me all in one piece, like a ghost, I shall know it is only my\r\neyes and stomach that are out of order. If it walks--my head is going.’\r\n\r\nHe approached the figure, which naturally kept at an unvarying distance\r\nfrom him, as is the use of all spectres that are born of overwork. It\r\nslid through the house and dissolved into swimming specks within the\r\neyeball as soon as it reached the burning light of the garden. Hummil\r\nwent about his business till even. When he came in to dinner he found\r\nhimself sitting at the table. The vision rose and walked out hastily.\r\nExcept that it cast no shadow it was in all respects real.\r\n\r\nNo living man knows what that week held for Hummil. An increase of the\r\nepidemic kept Spurstow in camp among the coolies, and all he could do\r\nwas to telegraph to Mottram, bidding him go to the bungalow and sleep\r\nthere. But Mottram was forty miles away from the nearest telegraph, and\r\nknew nothing of anything save the needs of the survey till he met, early\r\non Sunday morning, Lowndes and Spurstow heading towards Hummil’s for the\r\nweekly gathering.\r\n\r\n‘Hope the poor chap’s in a better temper,’ said the former, swinging\r\nhimself off his horse at the door. ‘I suppose he isn’t up yet.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ll just have a look at him,’ said the doctor. ‘If he’s asleep there’s\r\nno need to wake him.’\r\n\r\nAnd an instant later, by the tone of Spurstow’s voice calling upon them\r\nto enter, the men knew what had happened. There was no need to wake him.\r\n\r\nThe punkah was still being pulled over the bed, but Hummil had departed\r\nthis life at least three hours.\r\n\r\nThe body lay on its back, hands clinched by the side, as Spurstow had\r\nseen it lying seven nights previously. In the staring eyes was written\r\nterror beyond the expression of any pen.\r\n\r\nMottram, who had entered behind Lowndes, bent over the dead and touched\r\nthe forehead lightly with his lips. ‘Oh, you lucky, lucky devil!’ he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nBut Lowndes had seen the eyes, and withdrew shuddering to the other side\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n‘Poor chap! poor old chap! And the last time I met him I was angry.\r\nSpurstow, we should have watched him. Has he--?’\r\n\r\nDeftly Spurstow continued his investigations, ending by a search round\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n‘No, he hasn’t,’ he snapped. ‘There’s no trace of anything. Call the\r\nservants.’\r\n\r\nThey came, eight or ten of them, whispering and peering over each\r\nother’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n‘When did your Sahib go to bed?’ said Spurstow.\r\n\r\n‘At eleven or ten, we think,’ said Hummil’s personal servant.\r\n\r\n‘He was well then? But how should you know?’\r\n\r\n‘He was not ill, as far as our comprehension extended. But he had slept\r\nvery little for three nights. This I know, because I saw him walking\r\nmuch, and specially in the heart of the night.’\r\n\r\nAs Spurstow was arranging the sheet, a big straight-necked hunting-spur\r\ntumbled on the ground. The doctor groaned. The personal servant peeped\r\nat the body.\r\n\r\n‘What do you think, Chuma?’ said Spurstow, catching the look on the dark\r\nface.\r\n\r\n‘Heaven-born, in my poor opinion, this that was my master has descended\r\ninto the Dark Places, and there has been caught because he was not able\r\nto escape with sufficient speed. We have the spur for evidence that he\r\nfought with Fear. Thus have I seen men of my race do with thorns when\r\na spell was laid upon them to overtake them in their sleeping hours and\r\nthey dared not sleep.’\r\n\r\n‘Chuma, you’re a mud-head. Go out and prepare seals to be set on the\r\nSahib’s property.’\r\n\r\n‘God has made the Heaven-born. God has made me. Who are we, to inquire\r\ninto the dispensations of God? I will bid the other servants hold aloof\r\nwhile you are reckoning the tale of the Sahib’s property. They are all\r\nthieves, and would steal.’\r\n\r\n‘As far as I can make out, he died from--oh, anything; stoppage of the\r\nheart’s action, heat-apoplexy, or some other visitation,’ said Spurstow\r\nto his companions. ‘We must make an inventory of his effects, and so\r\non.’\r\n\r\n‘He was scared to death,’ insisted Lowndes. ‘Look at those eyes! For\r\npity’s sake don’t let him be buried with them open!’\r\n\r\n‘Whatever it was, he’s clear of all the trouble now,’ said Mottram\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\nSpurstow was peering into the open eyes.\r\n\r\n‘Come here,’ said he. ‘Can you see anything there?’\r\n\r\n‘I can’t face it!’ whimpered Lowndes. ‘Cover up the face! Is there any\r\nfear on earth that can turn a man into that likeness? It’s ghastly. Oh,\r\nSpurstow, cover it up!’\r\n\r\n‘No fear--on earth,’ said Spurstow. Mottram leaned over his shoulder and\r\nlooked intently.\r\n\r\n‘I see nothing except some gray blurs in the pupil. There can be nothing\r\nthere, you know.’\r\n\r\n‘Even so. Well, let’s think. It’ll take half a day to knock up any sort\r\nof coffin; and he must have died at midnight. Lowndes, old man, go out\r\nand tell the coolies to break ground next to Jevins’s grave. Mottram,\r\ngo round the house with Chuma and see that the seals are put on things.\r\nSend a couple of men to me here, and I’ll arrange.’\r\n\r\nThe strong-armed servants when they returned to their own kind told a\r\nstrange story of the doctor Sahib vainly trying to call their master\r\nback to life by magic arts,--to wit, the holding of a little green\r\nbox that clicked to each of the dead man’s eyes, and of a bewildered\r\nmuttering on the part of the doctor Sahib, who took the little green box\r\naway with him.\r\n\r\nThe resonant hammering of a coffin-lid is no pleasant thing to hear, but\r\nthose who have experience maintain that much more terrible is the soft\r\nswish of the bed-linen, the reeving and unreeving of the bed-tapes,\r\nwhen he who has fallen by the roadside is apparelled for burial, sinking\r\ngradually as the tapes are tied over, till the swaddled shape touches\r\nthe floor and there is no protest against the indignity of hasty\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment Lowndes was seized with scruples of conscience.\r\n‘Ought you to read the service,--from beginning to end?’ said he to\r\nSpurstow.\r\n\r\n‘I intend to. You’re my senior as a civilian. You can take it if you\r\nlike.’\r\n\r\n‘I didn’t mean that for a moment. I only thought if we could get a\r\nchaplain from somewhere,--I’m willing to ride anywhere,--and give poor\r\nHummil a better chance. That’s all.’\r\n\r\n‘Bosh!’ said Spurstow, as he framed his lips to the tremendous words\r\nthat stand at the head of the burial service.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they smoked a pipe in silence to the memory of the dead.\r\nThen Spurstow said absently--\r\n\r\n‘’Tisn’t in medical science.’\r\n\r\n‘What?’\r\n\r\n‘Things in a dead man’s eye.’\r\n\r\n‘For goodness’ sake leave that horror alone!’ said Lowndes. ‘I’ve seen\r\na native die of pure fright when a tiger chivied him. I know what killed\r\nHummil.’\r\n\r\n‘The deuce you do! I’m going to try to see.’ And the doctor retreated\r\ninto the bath-room with a Kodak camera. After a few minutes there was\r\nthe sound of something being hammered to pieces, and he emerged, very\r\nwhite indeed.\r\n\r\n‘Have you got a picture?’ said Mottram. ‘What does the thing look like?’\r\n\r\n‘It was impossible, of course. You needn’t look, Mottram. I’ve torn up\r\nthe films. There was nothing there. It was impossible.’\r\n\r\n‘That,’ said Lowndes, very distinctly, watching the shaking hand\r\nstriving to relight the pipe, ‘is a damned lie.’\r\n\r\nMottram laughed uneasily. ‘Spurstow’s right,’ he said. ‘We’re all in\r\nsuch a state now that we’d believe anything. For pity’s sake let’s try\r\nto be rational.’\r\n\r\nThere was no further speech for a long time. The hot wind whistled\r\nwithout, and the dry trees sobbed. Presently the daily train, winking\r\nbrass, burnished steel, and spouting steam, pulled up panting in the\r\nintense glare. ‘We’d better go on on that,’ said Spurstow. ‘Go back to\r\nwork. I’ve written my certificate. We can’t do any more good here, and\r\nwork’ll keep our wits together. Come on.’\r\n\r\nNo one moved. It is not pleasant to face railway journeys at mid-day\r\nin June. Spurstow gathered up his hat and whip, and, turning in the\r\ndoorway, said--\r\n\r\n‘There may be Heaven,--there must be Hell. Meantime, there is our life\r\nhere. We-ell?’\r\n\r\nNeither Mottram nor Lowndes had any answer to the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINY OF THE MAVERICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sec. 7.  { Cause       }              { in forces }   Regular forces,\r\n  (I)      { Consipiring }              { belonging }   Reserve forces,\r\n           { with other  }   a mutiny   { to Her    }   Auxiliary forces.\r\n           { persons to  }   sedition   { Majesty’s }   Navy.\r\n           { cause       }\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen three obscure gentlemen in San Francisco argued on insufficient\r\npremises they condemned a fellow-creature to a most unpleasant death in\r\na far country, which had nothing whatever to do with the United States.\r\nThey foregathered at the top of a tenement-house in Tehama Street, an\r\nunsavoury quarter of the city, and, there calling for certain drinks,\r\nthey conspired because they were conspirators by trade, officially known\r\nas the Third Three of the I.A.A.--an institution for the propagation\r\nof pure light, not to be confounded with any others, though it is\r\naffiliated to many. The Second Three live in Montreal, and work among\r\nthe poor there; the First Three have their home in New York, not far\r\nfrom Castle Garden, and write regularly once a week to a small house\r\nnear one of the big hotels at Boulogne. What happens after that, a\r\nparticular section of Scotland Yard knows too well, and laughs at. A\r\nconspirator detests ridicule. More men have been stabbed with Lucrezia\r\nBorgia daggers and dropped into the Thames for laughing at Head Centres\r\nand Triangles than for betraying secrets; for this is human nature.\r\n\r\nThe Third Three conspired over whisky cocktails and a clean sheet of\r\nnotepaper against the British Empire and all that lay therein. This work\r\nis very like what men without discernment call politics before a general\r\nelection. You pick out and discuss, in the company of congenial friends,\r\nall the weak points in your opponents’ organisation, and unconsciously\r\ndwell upon and exaggerate all their mishaps, till it seems to you a\r\nmiracle that the hated party holds together for an hour.\r\n\r\n‘Our principle is not so much active demonstration--that we leave to\r\nothers--as passive embarrassment, to weaken and unnerve,’ said the first\r\nman. ‘Wherever an organisation is crippled, wherever a confusion is\r\nthrown into any branch of any department, we gain a step for those\r\nwho take on the work; we are but the forerunners.’ He was a German\r\nenthusiast, and editor of a newspaper, from whose leading articles he\r\nquoted frequently.\r\n\r\n‘That cursed Empire makes so many blunders of her own that unless we\r\ndoubled the year’s average I guess it wouldn’t strike her anything\r\nspecial had occurred,’ said the second man. ‘Are you prepared to\r\nsay that all our resources are equal to blowing off the muzzle of a\r\nhundred-ton gun or spiking a ten-thousand-ton ship on a plain rock in\r\nclear daylight? They can beat us at our own game. ‘Better join hands\r\nwith the practical branches; we’re in funds now. Try a direct scare in a\r\ncrowded street. They value their greasy hides.’ He was the drag upon the\r\nwheel, and an Americanised Irishman of the second generation, despising\r\nhis own race and hating the other. He had learned caution.\r\n\r\nThe third man drank his cocktail and spoke no word. He was the\r\nstrategist, but unfortunately his knowledge of life was limited. He\r\npicked a letter from his breast-pocket and threw it across the table.\r\nThat epistle to the heathen contained some very concise directions from\r\nthe First Three in New York. It said--\r\n\r\n‘The boom in black iron has already affected the eastern markets, where\r\nour agents have been forcing down the English-held stock among the\r\nsmaller buyers who watch the turn of shares. Any immediate operations,\r\nsuch as western bears, would increase their willingness to unload.\r\nThis, however, cannot be expected till they see clearly that foreign\r\niron-masters are witting to co-operate. Mulcahy should be dispatched\r\nto feel the pulse of the market, and act accordingly. Mavericks are at\r\npresent the best for our purpose.--P.D.Q.’\r\n\r\nAs a message referring to an iron crisis in Pennsylvania, it was\r\ninteresting, if not lucid. As a new departure in organised attack on an\r\noutlying English dependency, it was more than interesting.\r\n\r\nThe second man read it through and murmured--\r\n\r\n‘Already? Surely they are in too great a hurry. All that Dhulip\r\nSingh could do in India he has done, down to the distribution of his\r\nphotographs among the peasantry. Ho! Ho! The Paris firm arranged that,\r\nand he has no substantial money backing from the Other Power. Even our\r\nagents in India know he hasn’t. What is the use of our organisation\r\nwasting men on work that is already done? Of course the Irish regiments\r\nin India are half mutinous as they stand.’\r\n\r\nThis shows how near a lie may come to the truth. An Irish regiment, for\r\njust so long as it stands still, is generally a hard handful to control,\r\nbeing reckless and rough. When, however, it is moved in the direction of\r\nmusketry-firing, it becomes strangely and unpatriotically content with\r\nits lot. It has even been heard to cheer the Queen with enthusiasm on\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nBut the notion of tampering with the army was, from the point of view of\r\nTehama Street, an altogether sound one. There is no shadow of stability\r\nin the policy of an English Government, and the most sacred oaths of\r\nEngland would, even if engrossed on vellum, find very few buyers among\r\ncolonies and dependencies that have suffered from vain beliefs. But\r\nthere remains to England always her army. That cannot change except\r\nin the matter of uniform and equipment. The officers may write to the\r\npapers demanding the heads of the Horse Guards in default of cleaner\r\nredress for grievances; the men may break loose across a country town\r\nand seriously startle the publicans; but neither officers nor men have\r\nit in their composition to mutiny after the continental manner. The\r\nEnglish people, when they trouble to think about the army at all, are,\r\nand with justice, absolutely assured that it is absolutely trustworthy.\r\nImagine for a moment their emotions on realising that such and such\r\na regiment was in open revolt from causes directly due to England’s\r\nmanagement of Ireland. They would probably send the regiment to the\r\npolls forthwith and examine their own consciences as to their duty to\r\nErin; but they would never be easy any more. And it was this vague,\r\nunhappy mistrust that the I. A. A. were labouring to produce.\r\n\r\n‘Sheer waste of breath,’ said the second man after a pause in the\r\ncouncil, ‘I don’t see the use of tampering with their fool-army, but\r\nit has been tried before and we must try it again. It looks well in the\r\nreports. If we send one man from here you may bet your life that other\r\nmen are going too. Order up Mulcahy.’\r\n\r\nThey ordered him up--a slim, slight, dark-haired young man, devoured\r\nwith that blind rancorous hatred of England that only reaches its full\r\ngrowth across the Atlantic. He had sucked it from his mother’s breast in\r\nthe little cabin at the back of the northern avenues of New York; he had\r\nbeen taught his rights and his wrongs, in German and Irish, on the canal\r\nfronts of Chicago; and San Francisco held men who told him strange and\r\nawful things of the great blind power over the seas. Once, when business\r\ntook him across the Atlantic, he had served in an English regiment, and\r\nbeing insubordinate had suffered extremely. He drew all his ideas of\r\nEngland that were not bred by the cheaper patriotic prints from one\r\niron-fisted colonel and an unbending adjutant. He would go to the mines\r\nif need be to teach his gospel. And he went as his instructions advised\r\np.d.q.--which means ‘with speed’--to introduce embarrassment into an\r\nIrish regiment, ‘already half-mutinous, quartered among Sikh peasantry,\r\nall wearing miniatures of His Highness Dhulip Singh, Maharaja of the\r\nPunjab, next their hearts, and all eagerly expecting his arrival.’ Other\r\ninformation equally valuable was given him by his masters. He was to be\r\ncautious, but never to grudge expense in winning the hearts of the men\r\nin the regiment. His mother in New York would supply funds, and he\r\nwas to write to her once a month. Life is pleasant for a man who has a\r\nmother in New York to send him two hundred pounds a year over and above\r\nhis regimental pay.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, thanks to his intimate knowledge of drill and\r\nmusketry exercise, the excellent Mulcahy, wearing the corporal’s stripe,\r\nwent out in a troopship and joined Her Majesty’s Royal Loyal Musketeers,\r\ncommonly known as the ‘Mavericks,’ because they were masterless and\r\nunbranded cattle-sons of small farmers in County Clare, shoeless\r\nvagabonds of Kerry, herders of Bally-vegan, much wanted ‘moonlighters’\r\nfrom the bare rainy headlands of the south coast, officered by O’Mores,\r\nBradys, Hills, Kilreas, and the like. Never to outward seeming was there\r\nmore promising material to work on. The First Three had chosen their\r\nregiment well. It feared nothing that moved or talked save the colonel\r\nand the regimental Roman Catholic chaplain, the fat Father Dennis, who\r\nheld the keys of heaven and hell, and blared like an angry bull when\r\nhe desired to be convincing. Him also it loved because on occasions of\r\nstress he was used to tuck up his cassock and charge with the rest into\r\nthe merriest of the fray, where he always found, good man, that the\r\nsaints sent him a revolver when there was a fallen private to be\r\nprotected, or--but this came as an afterthought--his own gray head to be\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\nCautiously as he had been instructed, tenderly and with much beer,\r\nMulcahy opened his projects to such as he deemed fittest to listen.\r\nAnd these were, one and all, of that quaint, crooked, sweet, profoundly\r\nirresponsible and profoundly lovable race that fight like fiends, argue\r\nlike children, reason like women, obey like men, and jest like their own\r\ngoblins of the rath through rebellion, loyalty, want, woe, or war. The\r\nunderground work of a conspiracy is always dull and very much the same\r\nthe world over. At the end of six months--the seed always falling on\r\ngood ground--Mulcahy spoke almost explicitly, hinting darkly in the\r\napproved fashion at dread powers behind him, and advising nothing more\r\nnor less than mutiny. Were they not dogs, evilly treated? had they not\r\nall their own and their national revenges to satisfy? Who in these days\r\nwould do aught to nine hundred men in rebellion? Who, again, could stay\r\nthem if they broke for the sea, licking up on their way other regiments\r\nonly too anxious to join? And afterwards... here followed windy promises\r\nof gold and preferment, office, and honour, ever dear to a certain type\r\nof Irishman.\r\n\r\nAs he finished his speech, in the dusk of a twilight, to his chosen\r\nassociates, there was a sound of a rapidly unslung belt behind him. The\r\narm of one Dan Grady flew out in the gloom and arrested something. Then\r\nsaid Dan---\r\n\r\n‘Mulcahy, you’re a great man, an’ you do credit to whoever sent you.\r\nWalk about a bit while we think of it.’ Mulcahy departed elate. He knew\r\nhis words would sink deep.\r\n\r\n‘Why the triple-dashed asterisks did ye not let me belt him?’ grunted a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n‘Because I’m not a fat-headed fool. Boys, ‘tis what he’s been driving at\r\nthese six months--our superior corpril with his education and his copies\r\nof the Irish papers and his everlasting beer. He’s been sent for the\r\npurpose and that’s where the money comes from. Can ye not see? That\r\nman’s a gold-mine, which Horse Egan here would have destroyed with a\r\nbelt-buckle. It would be throwing away the gifts of Providence not to\r\nfall in with his little plans. Of coorse we’ll mut’ny till all’s dry.\r\nShoot the colonel on the parade-ground, massacree the company officers,\r\nransack the arsenal, and then--Boys, did he tell you what next? He told\r\nme the other night when he was beginning to talk wild. Then we’re to\r\njoin with the niggers, and look for help from Dhulip Singh and the\r\nRussians!’\r\n\r\n‘And spoil the best campaign that ever was this side of Hell! Danny, I’d\r\nhave lost the beer to ha’ given him the belting he requires.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, let him go this awhile, man! He’s got no--no constructiveness, but\r\nthat’s the egg-meat of his plan, and you must understand that I’m\r\nin with it, an’ so are you. We’ll want oceans of beer to convince\r\nus--firmaments full. We’ll give him talk for his money, and one by one\r\nall the boys ‘ll come in and he’ll have a nest of nine hundred mutineers\r\nto squat in an’ give drink to.’\r\n\r\n‘What makes me killing-mad is his wanting us to do what the niggers\r\ndid thirty years gone. That an’ his pig’s cheek in saying that other\r\nregiments would come along,’ said a Kerry man.\r\n\r\n‘That’s not so bad as hintin’ we should loose off on the colonel.’\r\n\r\n‘Colonel be sugared! I’d as soon as not put a shot through his helmet\r\nto see him jump and clutch his old horse’s head. But Mulcahy talks o’\r\nshootin’ our comp’ny orf’cers accidental.’\r\n\r\n‘He said that, did he?’ said Horse Egan.\r\n\r\n‘Somethin’ like that, anyways. Can’t ye fancy ould Barber Brady wid a\r\nbullet in his lungs, coughin’ like a sick monkey, an’ sayin’, “Bhoys,\r\nI do not mind your gettin’ dhrunk, but you must hould your liquor like\r\nmen. The man that shot me is dhrunk. I’ll suspend investigations for six\r\nhours, while I get this bullet cut out, an’ then--“’\r\n\r\n‘An’ then,’ continued Horse Egan, for the peppery Major’s peculiarities\r\nof speech and manner were as well known as his tanned face; “‘an’ then,\r\nye dissolute, half-baked, putty-faced scum o’ Connemara, if I find a\r\nman so much as lookin’ confused, begad, I’ll coort-martial the whole\r\ncompany. A man that can’t get over his liquor in six hours is not fit to\r\nbelong to the Mavericks!”’\r\n\r\nA shout of laughter bore witness to the truth of the sketch.\r\n\r\n‘It’s pretty to think of,’ said the Kerry man slowly. ‘Mulcahy would\r\nhave us do all the devilmint, and get clear himself, someways. He wudn’t\r\nbe takin’ all this fool’s throuble in shpoilin’ the reputation of the\r\nregiment--’\r\n\r\n‘Reputation of your grandmother’s pig!’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Well, an’ HE had a good reputation tu; so it’s all right. Mulcahy\r\nmust see his way to clear out behind him, or he’d not ha’ come so far,\r\ntalkin’ powers of darkness.’\r\n\r\n‘Did you hear anything of a regimental court-martial among the Black\r\nBoneens, these days? Half a company of ‘em took one of the new draft\r\nan’ hanged him by his arms with a tent-rope from a third story verandah.\r\nThey gave no reason for so doin’, but he was half dead. I’m thinking\r\nthat the Boneens are short-sighted. It was a friend of Mulcahy’s, or\r\na man in the same trade. They’d a deal better ha’ taken his beer,’\r\nreturned Dan reflectively.\r\n\r\n‘Better still ha’ handed him up to the Colonel,’ said Horse Egan,\r\n‘onless--but sure the news wud be all over the counthry an’ give the\r\nreg’ment a bad name.’\r\n\r\n‘An’ there’d be no reward for that man--he but went about talkin’,’ said\r\nthe Kerry man artlessly.\r\n\r\n‘You speak by your breed,’ said Dan with a laugh. ‘There was never a\r\nKerry man yet that wudn’t sell his brother for a pipe o’ tobacco an’ a\r\npat on the back from a p’liceman.’\r\n\r\n‘Praise God I’m not a bloomin’ Orangeman,’ was the answer.\r\n\r\n‘No, nor never will be,’ said Dan. ‘They breed MEN in Ulster. Would you\r\nlike to thry the taste of one?’\r\n\r\nThe Kerry man looked and longed, but forbore. The odds of battle were\r\ntoo great.\r\n\r\n‘Then you’ll not even give Mulcahy a--a strike for his money,’ said the\r\nvoice of Horse Egan, who regarded what he called ‘trouble’ of any kind\r\nas the pinnacle of felicity.\r\n\r\nDan answered not at all, but crept on tip-toe, with large strides, to\r\nthe mess-room, the men following. The room was empty. In a corner, cased\r\nlike the King of Dahomey’s state umbrella, stood the regimental Colours.\r\nDan lifted them tenderly and unrolled in the light of the candles the\r\nrecord of the Mavericks--tattered, worn, and hacked. The white satin\r\nwas darkened everywhere with big brown stains, the gold threads on the\r\ncrowned harp were frayed and discoloured, and the Red Bull, the totem\r\nof the Mavericks, was coffee-hued. The stiff, embroidered folds, whose\r\nprice is human life, rustled down slowly. The Mavericks keep their\r\ncolours long and guard them very sacredly.\r\n\r\n‘Vittoria, Salamanca, Toulouse, Waterloo, Moodkee, Ferozshah, an’\r\nSobraon--that was fought close next door here, against the very beggars\r\nhe wants us to join. Inkermann, The Alma, Sebastopol! What are those\r\nlittle businesses compared to the campaigns of General Mulcahy? The\r\nMut’ny, think o’ that; the Mut’ny an’ some dirty little matters in\r\nAfghanistan; an’ for that an’ these an’ those’--Dan pointed to the names\r\nof glorious battles--‘that Yankee man with the partin’ in his hair comes\r\nan’ says as easy as “have a drink.”... Holy Moses, there’s the captain!’\r\n\r\nBut it was the mess-sergeant who came in just as the men clattered out,\r\nand found the colours uncased.\r\n\r\nFrom that day dated the mutiny of the Mavericks, to the joy of Mulcahy\r\nand the pride of his mother in New York--the good lady who sent the\r\nmoney for the beer. Never, so far as words went, was such a mutiny. The\r\nconspirators, led by Dan Grady and Horse Egan, poured in daily. They\r\nwere sound men, men to be trusted, and they all wanted blood; but first\r\nthey must have beer. They cursed the Queen, they mourned over Ireland,\r\nthey suggested hideous plunder of the Indian country side, and then,\r\nalas--some of the younger men would go forth and wallow on the ground in\r\nspasms of wicked laughter.\r\n\r\nThe genius of the Irish for conspiracies is remarkable. None the less\r\nthey would swear no oaths but those of their own making, which were rare\r\nand curious, and they were always at pains to impress Mulcahy with the\r\nrisks they ran. Naturally the flood of beer wrought demoralisation. But\r\nMulcahy confused the causes of things, and when a very muzzy Maverick\r\nsmote a sergeant on the nose or called his commanding officer a\r\nbald-headed old lard-bladder and even worse names, he fancied that\r\nrebellion and not liquor was at the bottom of the outbreak. Other\r\ngentlemen who have concerned themselves in larger conspiracies have made\r\nthe same error.\r\n\r\nThe hot season, in which they protested no man could rebel, came to an\r\nend, and Mulcahy suggested a visible return for his teachings. As to the\r\nactual upshot of the mutiny he cared nothing. It would be enough if the\r\nEnglish, infatuatedly trusting to the integrity of their army, should\r\nbe startled with news of an Irish regiment revolting from political\r\nconsiderations. His persistent demands would have ended, at Dan’s\r\ninstigation, in a regimental belting which in all probability would\r\nhave killed him and cut off the supply of beer, had not he been sent on\r\nspecial duty some fifty miles away from the cantonment to cool his heels\r\nin a mud fort and dismount obsolete artillery. Then the colonel of\r\nthe Mavericks, reading his newspaper diligently, and scenting Frontier\r\ntrouble from afar, posted to the army headquarters and pled with the\r\nCommander-in-chief for certain privileges, to be granted under certain\r\ncontingencies; which contingencies came about only a week later, when\r\nthe annual little war on the border developed itself and the colonel\r\nreturned to carry the good news to the Mavericks. He held the promise of\r\nthe Chief for active service, and the men must get ready.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day, Mulcahy, an unconsidered corporal--yet\r\ngreat in conspiracy--returned to cantonments, and heard sounds of strife\r\nand howlings from afar off. The mutiny had broken out and the barracks\r\nof the Mavericks were one white-washed pandemonium. A private tearing\r\nthrough the barrack-square, gasped in his ear, ‘Service! Active service.\r\nIt’s a burnin’ shame.’ Oh joy, the Mavericks had risen on the eve of\r\nbattle! They would not--noble and loyal sons of Ireland--serve the\r\nQueen longer. The news would flash through the country side and over to\r\nEngland, and he--Mulcahy--the trusted of the Third Three, had brought\r\nabout the crash. The private stood in the middle of the square and\r\ncursed colonel, regiment, officers, and doctor, particularly the doctor,\r\nby his gods. An orderly of the native cavalry regiment clattered through\r\nthe mob of soldiers. He was half lifted, half dragged from his horse,\r\nbeaten on the back with mighty hand-claps till his eyes watered, and\r\ncalled all manner of endearing names. Yes, the Mavericks had fraternised\r\nwith the native troops. Who then was the agent among the latter that had\r\nblindly wrought with Mulcahy so well?\r\n\r\nAn officer slunk, almost ran, from the mess to a barrack. He was mobbed\r\nby the infuriated soldiery, who closed round but did not kill him, for\r\nhe fought his way to shelter, flying for the life. Mulcahy could\r\nhave wept with pure joy and thankfulness. The very prisoners in the\r\nguard-room were shaking the bars of their cells and howling like wild\r\nbeasts, and from every barrack poured the booming as of a big war-drum.\r\n\r\nMulcahy hastened to his own barrack. He could hardly hear himself\r\nspeak. Eighty men were pounding with fist and heel the tables and\r\ntrestles--eighty men, flushed with mutiny, stripped to their shirt\r\nsleeves, their knapsacks half-packed for the march to the sea, made the\r\ntwo-inch boards thunder again as they chanted to a tune that Mulcahy\r\nknew well, the Sacred War Song of the Mavericks--\r\n\r\n     Listen in the north, my boys, there’s trouble on the wind;\r\n     Tramp o’ Cossack hooves in front, gray great-coats behind,\r\n     Trouble on the Frontier of a most amazin’ kind,\r\n       Trouble on the waters o’ the Oxus!\r\n\r\nThen, as a table broke under the furious accompaniment--\r\n\r\n     Hurrah! hurrah! it’s north by west we go;\r\n     Hurrah! hurrah! the chance we wanted so;\r\n     Let ‘em hear the chorus from Umballa to MosCOW,\r\n     As we go marchin’ to the Kremling.\r\n\r\n‘Mother of all the saints in bliss and all the devils in cinders,\r\nwhere’s my fine new sock widout the heel?’ howled Horse Egan, ransacking\r\neverybody’s valise but his own. He was engaged in making up deficiencies\r\nof kit preparatory to a campaign, and in that work he steals best who\r\nsteals last. ‘Ah, Mulcahy, you’re in good time,’ he shouted. ‘We’ve got\r\nthe route, and we’re off on Thursday for a pic-nic wid the Lancers next\r\ndoor.’\r\n\r\nAn ambulance orderly appeared with a huge basket full of lint rolls,\r\nprovided by the forethought of the Queen for such as might need\r\nthem later on. Horse Egan unrolled his bandage, and flicked it under\r\nMulcahy’s nose, chanting--\r\n\r\n    ‘Sheepskin an’ bees’ wax, thunder, pitch, and plaster,\r\n     The more you try to pull it off, the more it sticks the faster.\r\n     As I was goin’ to New Orleans--\r\n\r\n‘You know the rest of it, my Irish American-Jew boy. By gad, ye have to\r\nfight for the Queen in the inside av a fortnight, my darlin’.’\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter interrupted. Mulcahy looked vacantly down the room.\r\nBid a boy defy his father when the pantomime-cab is at the door; or\r\na girl develop a will of her own when her mother is putting the last\r\ntouches to the first ball-dress; but do not ask an Irish regiment to\r\nembark upon mutiny on the eve of a campaign; when it has fraternised\r\nwith the native regiment that accompanies it, and driven its officers\r\ninto retirement with ten thousand clamorous questions, and the prisoners\r\ndance for joy, and the sick men stand in the open, calling down all\r\nknown diseases on the head of the doctor, who has certified that they\r\nare “medically unfit for active service.” At even the Mavericks might\r\nhave been mistaken for mutineers by one so unversed in their natures\r\nas Mulcahy. At dawn a girls’ school might have learned deportment from\r\nthem. They knew that their colonel’s hand had closed, and that he who\r\nbroke that iron discipline would not go to the front: nothing in the\r\nworld will persuade one of our soldiers when he is ordered to the north\r\non the smallest of affairs that he is not immediately going gloriously\r\nto slay Cossacks and cook his kettles in the palace of the Czar. A few\r\nof the younger men mourned for Mulcahy’s beer, because the campaign was\r\nto be conducted on strict temperance principles, but as Dan and Horse\r\nEgan said sternly, ‘We’ve got the beer-man with us. He shall drink now\r\non his own hook.’\r\n\r\nMulcahy had not taken into account the possibility of being sent on\r\nactive service. He had made up his mind that he would not go under any\r\ncircumstances, but fortune was against him.\r\n\r\n‘Sick--you?’ said the doctor, who had served an unholy apprenticeship\r\nto his trade in Tralee poorhouses. ‘You’re only home-sick, and what you\r\ncall varicose veins come from over-eating. A little gentle exercise will\r\ncure that.’ And later, ‘Mulcahy, my man, everybody is allowed to apply\r\nfor a sick-certificate ONCE. If he tries it twice we call him by an ugly\r\nname. Go back to your duty, and let’s hear no more of your diseases.’\r\n\r\nI am ashamed to say that Horse Egan enjoyed the study of Mulcahy’s\r\nsoul in those days, and Dan took an equal interest. Together they would\r\ncommunicate to their corporal all the dark lore of death which is the\r\nportion of those who have seen men die. Egan had the larger experience,\r\nbut Dan the finer imagination. Mulcahy shivered when the former spoke of\r\nthe knife as an intimate acquaintance, or the latter dwelt with loving\r\nparticularity on the fate of those who, wounded and helpless, had been\r\noverlooked by the ambulances, and had fallen into the hands of the\r\nAfghan women-folk.\r\n\r\nMulcahy knew that the mutiny, for the present at least, was dead; knew,\r\ntoo, that a change had come over Dan’s usually respectful attitude\r\ntowards him, and Horse Egan’s laughter and frequent allusions to\r\nabortive conspiracies emphasised all that the conspirator had guessed.\r\nThe horrible fascination of the death-stories, however, made him seek\r\nthe men’s society. He learnt much more than he had bargained for; and in\r\nthis manner: It was on the last night before the regiment entrained to\r\nthe front. The barracks were stripped of everything movable, and the\r\nmen were too excited to sleep. The bare walls gave out a heavy hospital\r\nsmell of chloride of lime.\r\n\r\n‘And what,’ said Mulcahy in an awe-stricken whisper, after some\r\nconversation on the eternal subject, ‘are you going to do to me, Dan?’\r\nThis might have been the language of an able conspirator conciliating a\r\nweak spirit.\r\n\r\n‘You’ll see,’ said Dan grimly, turning over in his cot, ‘or I rather\r\nshud say you’ll not see.’\r\n\r\nThis was hardly the language of a weak spirit. Mulcahy shook under the\r\nbed-clothes.\r\n\r\n‘Be easy with him,’ put in Egan from the next cot. ‘He has got his\r\nchanst o’ goin’ clean. Listen, Mulcahy; all we want is for the good sake\r\nof the regiment that you take your death standing up, as a man shud.\r\nThere be heaps an’ heaps of enemy--plenshus heaps. Go there an’ do all\r\nyou can and die decent. You’ll die with a good name THERE. ‘Tis not a\r\nhard thing considerin’.’\r\n\r\nAgain Mulcahy shivered.\r\n\r\n‘An’ how could a man wish to die better than fightin’?’ added Dan\r\nconsolingly.\r\n\r\n‘And if I won’t?’ said the corporal in a dry whisper.\r\n\r\n‘There’ll be a dale of smoke,’ returned Dan, sitting up and ticking off\r\nthe situation on his fingers, ‘sure to be, an’ the noise of the firin’\r\n‘ll be tremenjus, an’ we’ll be running about up and down, the regiment\r\nwill. But WE, Horse and I--we’ll stay by you, Mulcahy, and never let you\r\ngo. Maybe there’ll be an accident.’\r\n\r\n‘It’s playing it low on me. Let me go. For pity’s sake let me go. I\r\nnever did you harm, and--and I stood you as much beer as I could. Oh,\r\ndon’t be hard on me, Dan! You are--you were in it too. You won’t kill me\r\nup there, will you?’\r\n\r\n‘I’m not thinkin’ of the treason; though you shud be glad any honest\r\nboys drank with you. It’s for the regiment. We can’t have the shame o’\r\nyou bringin’ shame on us. You went to the doctor quiet as a sick cat\r\nto get and stay behind an’ live with the women at the depot--you that\r\nwanted us to run to the sea in wolf-packs like the rebels none of your\r\nblack blood dared to be! But WE knew about your goin’ to the doctor, for\r\nhe told in mess, and it’s all over the regiment. Bein’, as we are, your\r\nbest friends, we didn’t allow any one to molest you YET. We will see to\r\nyou ourselves. Fight which you will--us or the enemy--you’ll never lie\r\nin that cot again, and there’s more glory and maybe less kicks from\r\nfightin’ the enemy. That’s fair speakin’.’\r\n\r\n‘And he told us by word of mouth to go and join with the niggers--you’ve\r\nforgotten that, Dan,’ said Horse Egan, to justify sentence.\r\n\r\n‘What’s the use of plaguin’ the man? One shot pays for all. Sleep ye\r\nsound, Mulcahy. But you onderstand, do ye not?’\r\n\r\nMulcahy for some weeks understood very little of anything at all save\r\nthat ever at his elbow, in camp, or at parade, stood two big men with\r\nsoft voices adjuring him to commit hari-kari lest a worse thing should\r\nhappen--to die for the honour of the regiment in decency among the\r\nnearest knives. But Mulcahy dreaded death. He remembered certain things\r\nthat priests had said in his infancy, and his mother--not the one at New\r\nYork--starting from her sleep with shrieks to pray for a husband’s soul\r\nin torment. It is well to be of a cultured intelligence, but in time\r\nof trouble the weak human mind returns to the creed it sucked in at the\r\nbreast, and if that creed be not a pretty one trouble follows. Also,\r\nthe death he would have to face would be physically painful. Most\r\nconspirators have large imaginations. Mulcahy could see himself, as he\r\nlay on the earth in the night, dying by various causes. They were all\r\nhorrible; the mother in New York was very far away, and the Regiment,\r\nthe engine that, once you fall in its grip, moves you forward whether\r\nyou will or won’t, was daily coming closer to the enemy!\r\n\r\nThey were brought to the field of Marzun-Katai, and with the Black\r\nBoneens to aid, they fought a fight that has never been set down in the\r\nnewspapers. In response, many believe, to the fervent prayers of Father\r\nDennis, the enemy not only elected to fight in the open, but made a\r\nbeautiful fight, as many weeping Irish mothers knew later. They gathered\r\nbehind walls or flickered across the open in shouting masses, and were\r\npot-valiant in artillery. It was expedient to hold a large reserve\r\nand wait for the psychological moment that was being prepared by the\r\nshrieking shrapnel. Therefore the Mavericks lay down in open order on\r\nthe brow of a hill to watch the play till their call should come.\r\nFather Dennis, whose duty was in the rear, to smooth the trouble of the\r\nwounded, had naturally managed to make his way to the foremost of his\r\nboys and lay like a black porpoise, at length on the grass. To him\r\ncrawled Mulcahy, ashen-gray, demanding absolution.\r\n\r\n‘Wait till you’re shot,’ said Father Dennis sweetly. ‘There’s a time for\r\neverything.’\r\n\r\nDan Grady chuckled as he blew for the fiftieth time into the breech of\r\nhis speckless rifle. Mulcahy groaned and buried his head in his arms\r\ntill a stray shot spoke like a snipe immediately above his head, and a\r\ngeneral heave and tremour rippled the line. Other shots followed and a\r\nfew took effect, as a shriek or a grunt attested. The officers, who had\r\nbeen lying down with the men, rose and began to walk steadily up and\r\ndown the front of their companies.\r\n\r\nThis manoeuvre, executed, not for publication, but as a guarantee of\r\ngood faith, to soothe men, demands nerve. You must not hurry, you must\r\nnot look nervous, though you know that you are a mark for every rifle\r\nwithin extreme range, and above all if you are smitten you must make as\r\nlittle noise as possible and roll inwards through the files. It is at\r\nthis hour, when the breeze brings the first salt whiff of the powder\r\nto noses rather cold at the tip, and the eye can quietly take in the\r\nappearance of each red casualty, that the strain on the nerves is\r\nstrongest. Scotch regiments can endure for half a day and abate no\r\nwhit of their zeal at the end; English regiments sometimes sulk under\r\npunishment, while the Irish, like the French, are apt to run forward\r\nby ones and twos, which is just as bad as running back. The truly wise\r\ncommandant of highly strung troops allows them, in seasons of waiting,\r\nto hear the sound of their own voices uplifted in song. There is a\r\nlegend of an English regiment that lay by its arms under fire chaunting\r\n‘Sam Hall,’ to the horror of its newly appointed and pious colonel. The\r\nBlack Boneens, who were suffering more than the Mavericks, on a hill\r\nhalf a mile away, began presently to explain to all who cared to\r\nlisten--\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ll sound the jubilee, from the centre to the sea, And Ireland shall\r\nbe free, says the Shan-van Vogh.\r\n\r\n‘Sing, boys,’ said Father Dennis softly. ‘It looks as if we cared for\r\ntheir Afghan peas.’\r\n\r\nDan Grady raised himself to his knees and opened his mouth in a song\r\nimparted to him, as to most of his comrades, in the strictest confidence\r\nby Mulcahy---the Mulcahy then lying limp and fainting on the grass, the\r\nchill fear of death upon him.\r\n\r\nCompany after company caught up the words which, the I. A. A. say, are\r\nto herald the general rising of Erin, and to breathe which, except to\r\nthose duly appointed to hear, is death. Wherefore they are printed in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n     The Saxon in Heaven’s just balance is weighed,\r\n       His doom like Belshazzar’s in death has been cast,\r\n     And the hand of the venger shall never be stayed\r\n       Till his race, faith, and speech are a dream of the past.\r\n\r\nThey were heart-filling lines and they ran with a swirl; the I. A. A.\r\nare better served by their pens than their petards. Dan clapped Mulcahy\r\nmerrily on the back, asking him to sing up. The officers lay down again.\r\nThere was no need to walk any more. Their men were soothing themselves\r\nthunderously, thus--\r\n\r\n     St. Mary in Heaven has written the vow\r\n       That the land shall not rest till the heretic blood,\r\n     From the babe at the breast to the hand at the plough,\r\n       Has rolled to the ocean like Shannon in flood!\r\n\r\n‘I’ll speak to you after all’s over,’ said Father Dennis authoritatively\r\nin Dan’s ear. ‘What’s the use of confessing to me when you do this\r\nfoolishness? Dan, you’ve been playing with fire! I’ll lay you more\r\npenance in a week than--’\r\n\r\n‘Come along to Purgatory with us, Father dear. The Boneens are on the\r\nmove; they’ll let us go now!’\r\n\r\nThe regiment rose to the blast of the bugle as one man; but one man\r\nthere was who rose more swiftly than all the others, for half an inch of\r\nbayonet was in the fleshy part of his leg.\r\n\r\n‘You’ve got to do it,’ said Dan grimly. ‘Do it decent, anyhow;’ and\r\nthe roar of the rush drowned his words, for the rear companies thrust\r\nforward the first, still singing as they swung down the slope---\r\n\r\nFrom the child at the breast to the hand at the plough Shall roll to the\r\nocean like Shannon in flood!\r\n\r\nThey should have sung it in the face of England, not of the Afghans,\r\nwhom, it impressed as much as did the wild Irish yell.\r\n\r\n‘They came down singing,’ said the unofficial report of the enemy, borne\r\nfrom village to village the next day. ‘They continued to sing, and it\r\nwas written that our men could not abide when they came. It is believed\r\nthat there was magic in the aforesaid song.’\r\n\r\nDan and Horse Egan kept themselves in the neighbourhood of Mulcahy.\r\nTwice the man would have bolted back in the confusion. Twice he was\r\nheaved, kicked, and shouldered back again into the unpaintable inferno\r\nof a hotly contested charge.\r\n\r\nAt the end, the panic excess of his fear drove him into madness beyond\r\nall human courage. His eyes staring at nothing, his mouth open and\r\nfrothing, and breathing as one in a cold bath, he went forward demented,\r\nwhile Dan toiled after him. The charge checked at a high mud wall. It\r\nwas Mulcahy who scrambled up tooth and nail and hurled down among the\r\nbayonets the amazed Afghan who barred his way. It was Mulcahy, keeping\r\nto the straight line of the rabid dog, who led a collection of ardent\r\nsouls at a newly unmasked battery and flung himself on the muzzle of a\r\ngun as his companions danced among the gunners. It was Mulcahy who ran\r\nwildly on from that battery into the open plain, where the enemy were\r\nretiring in sullen groups. His hands were empty, he had lost helmet and\r\nbelt, and he was bleeding from a wound in the neck. Dan and Horse Egan,\r\npanting and distressed, had thrown themselves down on the ground by the\r\ncaptured guns, when they noticed Mulcahy’s charge.\r\n\r\n‘Mad,’ said Horse Egan critically. ‘Mad with fear! He’s going straight\r\nto his death, an’ shouting’s no use.’\r\n\r\n‘Let him go. Watch now! If we fire we’ll hit him, maybe.’\r\n\r\nThe last of a hurrying crowd of Afghans turned at the noise of shod feet\r\nbehind him, and shifted his knife ready to hand. This, he saw, was no\r\ntime to take prisoners. Mulcahy tore on, sobbing; the straight-held\r\nblade went home through the defenceless breast, and the body pitched\r\nforward almost before a shot from Dan’s rifle brought down the slayer\r\nand still further hurried the Afghan retreat. The two Irishmen went out\r\nto bring in their dead.\r\n\r\n‘He was given the point and that was an easy death,’ said Horse Egan,\r\nviewing the corpse. ‘But would you ha’ shot him, Danny, if he had\r\nlived?’\r\n\r\n‘He didn’t live, so there’s no sayin’. But I doubt I wud have bekase\r\nof the fun he gave us--let alone the beer. Hike up his legs, Horse, and\r\nwe’ll bring him in. Perhaps ‘tis better this way.’\r\n\r\nThey bore the poor limp body to the mass of the regiment, lolling\r\nopen-mouthed on their rifles; and there was a general snigger when one\r\nof the younger subalterns said, ‘That was a good man!’\r\n\r\n‘Phew,’ said Horse Egan, when a burial-party had taken over the burden.\r\n‘I’m powerful dhry, and this reminds me there’ll be no more beer at\r\nall.’\r\n\r\n‘Fwhy not?’ said Dan, with a twinkle in his eye as he stretched himself\r\nfor rest. ‘Are we not conspirin’ all we can, an’ while we conspire are\r\nwe not entitled to free dhrinks? Sure his ould mother in New York would\r\nnot let her son’s comrades perish of drouth--if she can be reached at\r\nthe end of a letter.’\r\n\r\n‘You’re a janius,’ said Horse Egan. ‘O’ coorse she will not. I wish\r\nthis crool war was over an’ we’d get back to canteen. Faith, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief ought to be hanged in his own little sword-belt for\r\nmakin’ us work on wather.’\r\n\r\nThe Mavericks were generally of Horse Egan’s opinion. So they made\r\nhaste to get their work done as soon as possible, and their industry was\r\nrewarded by unexpected peace. ‘We can fight the sons of Adam,’ said the\r\ntribesmen, ‘but we cannot fight the sons of Eblis, and this regiment\r\nnever stays still in one place. Let us therefore come in.’ They came\r\nin and ‘this regiment’ withdrew to conspire under the leadership of Dan\r\nGrady.\r\n\r\nExcellent as a subordinate Dan failed altogether as a\r\nchief-in-command--possibly because he was too much swayed by the advice\r\nof the only man in the regiment who could manufacture more than one kind\r\nof handwriting. The same mail that bore to Mulcahy’s mother in New York\r\na letter from the colonel telling her how valiantly her son had fought\r\nfor the Queen, and how assuredly he would have been recommended for the\r\nVictoria Cross had he survived, carried a communication signed, I grieve\r\nto say, by that same colonel and all the officers of the regiment,\r\nexplaining their willingness to do ‘anything which is contrary to the\r\nregulations and all kinds of revolutions’ if only a little money could\r\nbe forwarded to cover incidental expenses. Daniel Grady, Esquire, would\r\nreceive funds, vice Mulcahy, who ‘was unwell at this present time of\r\nwriting.’\r\n\r\nBoth letters were forwarded from New York to Tehama Street, San\r\nFrancisco, with marginal comments as brief as they were bitter.\r\nThe Third Three read and looked at each other. Then the Second\r\nConspirator-he who believed in ‘joining hands with the practical\r\nbranches’---began to laugh, and on recovering his gravity said,\r\n‘Gentlemen, I consider this will be a lesson to us. We’re left again.\r\nThose cursed Irish have let us down. I knew they would, but’-here he\r\nlaughed afresh-’I’d give considerable to know what was at the back of it\r\nall.’\r\n\r\nHis curiosity would have been satisfied had he seen Dan Grady,\r\ndiscredited regimental conspirator, trying to explain to his thirsty\r\ncomrades in India the non-arrival of funds from New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK OF THE BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Gods and my Gods-do you or I know which are the stronger? Native\r\nProverb.\r\n\r\nEAST of Suez, some hold, the direct control of Providence ceases; Man\r\nbeing there handed over to the power of the Gods and Devils of Asia,\r\nand the Church of England Providence only exercising an occasional and\r\nmodified supervision in the case of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThis theory accounts for some of the more unnecessary horrors of life in\r\nIndia: it may be stretched to explain my story.\r\n\r\nMy friend Strickland of the Police, who knows as much of natives of\r\nIndia as is good for any man, can bear witness to the facts of the case.\r\nDumoise, our doctor, also saw what Strickland and I saw. The inference\r\nwhich he drew from the evidence was entirely incorrect. He is dead now;\r\nhe died, in a rather curious manner, which has been elsewhere described.\r\n\r\nWhen Fleete came to India he owned a little money and some land in the\r\nHimalayas, near a place called Dharmsala. Both properties had been left\r\nhim by an uncle, and he came out to finance them. He was a big, heavy,\r\ngenial, and inoffensive man. His knowledge of natives was, of course,\r\nlimited, and he complained of the difficulties of the language.\r\n\r\nHe rode in from his place in the hills to spend New Year in the station,\r\nand he stayed with Strickland. On New Year’s Eve there was a big dinner\r\nat the club, and the night was excusably wet. When men foregather from\r\nthe uttermost ends of the Empire, they have a right to be riotous. The\r\nFrontier had sent down a contingent o’ Catch-’em-Alive-O’s who had not\r\nseen twenty white faces for a year, and were used to ride fifteen miles\r\nto dinner at the next Fort at the risk of a Khyberee bullet where their\r\ndrinks should lie. They profited by their new security, for they tried\r\nto play pool with a curled-up hedgehog found in the garden, and one\r\nof them carried the marker round the room in his teeth. Half a dozen\r\nplanters had come in from the south and were talking ‘horse’ to the\r\nBiggest Liar in Asia, who was trying to cap all their stories at once.\r\nEverybody was there, and there was a general closing up of ranks and\r\ntaking stock of our losses in dead or disabled that had fallen during\r\nthe past year. It was a very wet night, and I remember that we sang\r\n‘Auld Lang Syne’ with our feet in the Polo Championship Cup, and our\r\nheads among the stars, and swore that we were all dear friends. Then\r\nsome of us went away and annexed Burma, and some tried to open up the\r\nSoudan and were opened up by Fuzzies in that cruel scrub outside Suakim,\r\nand some found stars and medals, and some were married, which was bad,\r\nand some did other things which were worse, and the others of us stayed\r\nin our chains and strove to make money on insufficient experiences.\r\n\r\nFleete began the night with sherry and bitters, drank champagne steadily\r\nup to dessert, then raw, rasping Capri with all the strength of whisky,\r\ntook Benedictine with his coffee, four or five whiskies and sodas to\r\nimprove his pool strokes, beer and bones at half-past two, winding up\r\nwith old brandy. Consequently, when he came out, at half-past three in\r\nthe morning, into fourteen degrees of frost, he was very angry with his\r\nhorse for coughing, and tried to leapfrog into the saddle. The horse\r\nbroke away and went to his stables; so Strickland and I formed a Guard\r\nof Dishonour to take Fleete home.\r\n\r\nOur road lay through the bazaar, close to a little temple of Hanuman,\r\nthe Monkey-god, who is a leading divinity worthy of respect. All gods\r\nhave good points, just as have all priests. Personally, I attach much\r\nimportance to Hanuman, and am kind to his people--the great gray apes of\r\nthe hills. One never knows when one may want a friend.\r\n\r\nThere was a light in the temple, and as we passed, we could hear voices\r\nof men chanting hymns. In a native temple, the priests rise at all hours\r\nof the night to do honour to their god. Before we could stop him, Fleete\r\ndashed up the steps, patted two priests on the back, and was gravely\r\ngrinding the ashes of his cigar-butt into the forehead of the red stone\r\nimage of Hanuman. Strickland tried to drag him out, but he sat down and\r\nsaid solemnly:\r\n\r\n‘Shee that? ‘Mark of the B-beasht! _I_ made it. Ishn’t it fine?’\r\n\r\nIn half a minute the temple was alive and noisy, and Strickland, who\r\nknew what came of polluting gods, said that things might occur. He,\r\nby virtue of his official position, long residence in the country, and\r\nweakness for going among the natives, was known to the priests and he\r\nfelt unhappy. Fleete sat on the ground and refused to move. He said that\r\n‘good old Hanuman’ made a very soft pillow.\r\n\r\nThen, without any warning, a Silver Man came out of a recess behind the\r\nimage of the god. He was perfectly naked in that bitter, bitter cold,\r\nand his body shone like frosted silver, for he was what the Bible calls\r\n‘a leper as white as snow.’ Also he had no face, because he was a leper\r\nof some years’ standing and his disease was heavy upon him. We two\r\nstooped to haul Fleete up, and the temple was filling and filling with\r\nfolk who seemed to spring from the earth, when the Silver Man ran in\r\nunder our arms, making a noise exactly like the mewing of an otter,\r\ncaught Fleete round the body and dropped his head on Fleete’s breast\r\nbefore we could wrench him away. Then he retired to a corner and sat\r\nmewing while the crowd blocked all the doors.\r\n\r\nThe priests were very angry until the Silver Man touched Fleete. That\r\nnuzzling seemed to sober them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few minutes’ silence one of the priests came to\r\nStrickland and said, in perfect English, ‘Take your friend away. He has\r\ndone with Hanuman, but Hanurnan has not done with him.’ The crowd gave\r\nroom and we carried Fleete into the road.\r\n\r\nStrickland was very angry. He said that we might all three have been\r\nknifed, and that Fleete should thank his stars that he had escaped\r\nwithout injury.\r\n\r\nFleete thanked no one. He said that he wanted to go to bed. He was\r\ngorgeously drunk.\r\n\r\nWe moved on, Strickland silent and wrathful, until Fleete was taken\r\nwith violent shivering fits and sweating. He said that the smells of\r\nthe bazaar were overpowering, and he wondered why slaughter-houses were\r\npermitted so near English residences. ‘Can’t you smell the blood?’ said\r\nFleete.\r\n\r\nWe put him to bed at last, just as the dawn was breaking, and Strickland\r\ninvited me to have another whisky and soda. While we were drinking he\r\ntalked of the trouble in the temple, and admitted that it baffled him\r\ncompletely. Strickland hates being mystified by natives, because his\r\nbusiness in life is to overmatch them with their own weapons. He has not\r\nyet succeeded in doing this, but in fifteen or twenty years he will have\r\nmade some small progress.\r\n\r\n‘They should have mauled us,’ he said, ‘instead of mewing at us. I\r\nwonder what they meant. I don’t like it one little bit.’\r\n\r\nI said that the Managing Committee of the temple would in all\r\nprobability bring a criminal action against us for insulting their\r\nreligion. There was a section of the Indian Penal Code which exactly\r\nmet Fleete’s offence. Strickland said he only hoped and prayed that they\r\nwould do this. Before I left I looked into Fleete’s room, and saw him\r\nlying on his right side, scratching his left breast. Then. I went to bed\r\ncold, depressed, and unhappy, at seven o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock I rode over to Strickland’s house to inquire after\r\nFleete’s head. I imagined that it would be a sore one. Fleete was\r\nbreakfasting and seemed unwell. His temper was gone, for he was abusing\r\nthe cook for not supplying him with an underdone chop. A man who can\r\neat raw meat after a wet night is a curiosity. I told Fleete this and he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n‘You breed queer mosquitoes in these parts,’ he said. ‘I’ve been bitten\r\nto pieces, but only in one place.’\r\n\r\n‘Let’s have a look at the bite,’ said Strickland. ‘It may have gone down\r\nsince this morning.’\r\n\r\nWhile the chops were being cooked, Fleete opened his shirt and showed\r\nus, just over his left breast, a mark, the perfect double of the black\r\nrosettes--the five or six irregular blotches arranged in a circle--on\r\na leopard’s hide. Strickland looked and said, ‘It was only pink this\r\nmorning. It’s grown black now.’\r\n\r\nFleete ran to a glass.\r\n\r\n‘By Jove!’ he said,’ this is nasty. What is it?’\r\n\r\nWe could not answer. Here the chops came in, all red and juicy, and\r\nFleete bolted three in a most offensive manner. He ate on his right\r\ngrinders only, and threw his head over his right shoulder as he snapped\r\nthe meat. When he had finished, it struck him that he had been behaving\r\nstrangely, for he said apologetically, ‘I don’t think I ever felt so\r\nhungry in my life. I’ve bolted like an ostrich.’\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Strickland said to me, ‘Don’t go. Stay here, and stay\r\nfor the night.’\r\n\r\nSeeing that my house was not three miles from Strickland’s, this request\r\nwas absurd. But Strickland insisted, and was going to say something when\r\nFleete interrupted by declaring in a shamefaced way that he felt hungry\r\nagain. Strickland sent a man to my house to fetch over my bedding and a\r\nhorse, and we three went down to Strickland’s stables to pass the hours\r\nuntil it was time to go out for a ride. The man who has a weakness for\r\nhorses never wearies of inspecting them; and when two men are killing\r\ntime in this way they gather knowledge and lies the one from the other.\r\n\r\nThere were five horses in the stables, and I shall never forget the\r\nscene as we tried to look them over. They seemed to have gone mad. They\r\nreared and screamed and nearly tore up their pickets; they sweated and\r\nshivered and lathered and were distraught with fear. Strickland’s\r\nhorses used to know him as well as his dogs; which made the matter more\r\ncurious. We left the stable for fear of the brutes throwing themselves\r\nin their panic. Then Strickland turned back and called me. The horses\r\nwere still frightened, but they let us ‘gentle’ and make much of them,\r\nand put their heads in our bosoms.\r\n\r\n‘They aren’t afraid of US,’ said Strickland. ‘D’you know, I’d give three\r\nmonths’ pay if OUTRAGE here could talk.’\r\n\r\nBut Outrage was dumb, and could only cuddle up to his master and blow\r\nout his nostrils, as is the custom of horses when they wish to explain\r\nthings but can’t. Fleete came up when we were in the stalls, and as soon\r\nas the horses saw him, their fright broke out afresh. It was all that we\r\ncould do to escape from the place unkicked. Strickland said, ‘They don’t\r\nseem to love you, Fleete.’\r\n\r\n‘Nonsense,’ said Fleete; ‘my mare will follow me like a dog.’ He went\r\nto her; she was in a loose-box; but as he slipped the bars she plunged,\r\nknocked him down, and broke away into the garden. I laughed, but\r\nStrickland was not amused. He took his moustache in both fists and\r\npulled at it till it nearly came out. Fleete, instead of going off to\r\nchase his property, yawned, saying that he felt sleepy. He went to the\r\nhouse to lie down, which was a foolish way of spending New Year’s Day.\r\n\r\nStrickland sat with me in the stables and asked if I had noticed\r\nanything peculiar in Fleete’s manner. I said that he ate his food like\r\na beast; but that this might have been the result of living alone in the\r\nhills out of the reach of society as refined and elevating as ours for\r\ninstance. Strickland was not amused. I do not think that he listened to\r\nme, for his next sentence referred to the mark on Fleete’s breast, and\r\nI said that it might have been caused by blister-flies, or that it was\r\npossibly a birth-mark newly born and now visible for the first time.\r\nWe both agreed that it was unpleasant to look at, and Strickland found\r\noccasion to say that I was a fool.\r\n\r\n‘I can’t tell you what I think now,’ said he, ‘because you would call me\r\na madman; but you must stay with me for the next few days, if you can.\r\nI want you to watch Fleete, but don’t tell me what you think till I have\r\nmade up my mind.’\r\n\r\n‘But I am dining out to-night,’ I said. ‘So am I,’ said Strickland, ‘and\r\nso is Fleete. At least if he doesn’t change his mind.’\r\n\r\nWe walked about the garden smoking, but saying nothing--because we were\r\nfriends, and talking spoils good tobacco--till our pipes were out. Then\r\nwe went to wake up Fleete. He was wide awake and fidgeting about his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n‘I say, I want some more chops,’ he said. ‘Can I get them?’\r\n\r\nWe laughed and said, ‘Go and change. The ponies will be round in a\r\nminute.’\r\n\r\n‘All right,’ said Fleete. I’ll go when I get the chops--underdone ones,\r\nmind.’\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be quite in earnest. It was four o’clock, and we had had\r\nbreakfast at one; still, for a long time, he demanded those underdone\r\nchops. Then he changed into riding clothes and went out into the\r\nverandah. His pony--the mare had not been caught--would not let him come\r\nnear. All three horses were unmanageable---mad with fear---and finally\r\nFleete said that he would stay at home and get something to eat.\r\nStrickland and I rode out wondering. As we passed the temple of Hanuman,\r\nthe Silver Man came out and mewed at us.\r\n\r\n‘He is not one of the regular priests of the temple,’ said Strickland.\r\n‘I think I should peculiarly like to lay my hands on him.’\r\n\r\nThere was no spring in our gallop on the racecourse that evening. The\r\nhorses were stale, and moved as though they had been ridden out.\r\n\r\n‘The fright after breakfast has been too much for them,’ said\r\nStrickland.\r\n\r\nThat was the only remark he made through the remainder of the ride. Once\r\nor twice I think he swore to himself; but that did not count.\r\n\r\nWe came back in the dark at seven o’clock, and saw that there were\r\nno lights in the bungalow. ‘Careless ruffians my servants are!’ said\r\nStrickland.\r\n\r\nMy horse reared at something on the carriage drive, and Fleete stood up\r\nunder its nose.\r\n\r\n‘What are you doing, grovelling about the garden?’ said Strickland.\r\n\r\nBut both horses bolted and nearly threw us. We dismounted by the\r\nstables and returned to Fleete, who was on his hands and knees under the\r\norange-bushes.\r\n\r\n‘What the devil’s wrong with you?’ said Strickland.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing, nothing in the world,’ said Fleete, speaking very quickly\r\nand thickly. ‘I’ve been gardening-botanising you know. The smell of\r\nthe earth is delightful. I think I’m going for a walk-a long walk-all\r\nnight.’\r\n\r\nThen I saw that there was something excessively out of order somewhere,\r\nand I said to Strickland, ‘I am not dining out.’\r\n\r\n‘Bless you!’ said Strickland. ‘Here, Fleete, get up. You’ll catch fever\r\nthere. Come in to dinner and let’s have the lamps lit. We ‘ll all dine\r\nat home.’\r\n\r\nFleete stood up unwillingly, and said, ‘No lamps-no lamps. It’s much\r\nnicer here. Let’s dine outside and have some more chops-lots of ‘em and\r\nunderdone--bloody ones with gristle.’\r\n\r\nNow a December evening in Northern India is bitterly cold, and Fleete’s\r\nsuggestion was that of a maniac.\r\n\r\n‘Come in,’ said Strickland sternly. ‘Come in at once.’\r\n\r\nFleete came, and when the lamps were brought, we saw that he was\r\nliterally plastered with dirt from head to foot. He must have been\r\nrolling in the garden. He shrank from the light and went to his room.\r\nHis eyes were horrible to look at. There was a green light behind them,\r\nnot in them, if you understand, and the man’s lower lip hung down.\r\n\r\nStrickland said, ‘There is going to be trouble-big trouble-to-night.\r\nDon’t you change your riding-things.’\r\n\r\nWe waited and waited for Fleete’s reappearance, and ordered dinner in\r\nthe meantime. We could hear him moving about his own room, but there was\r\nno light there. Presently from the room came the long-drawn howl of a\r\nwolf.\r\n\r\nPeople write and talk lightly of blood running cold and hair standing up\r\nand things of that kind. Both sensations are too horrible to be trifled\r\nwith. My heart stopped as though a knife had been driven through it, and\r\nStrickland turned as white as the tablecloth.\r\n\r\nThe howl was repeated, and was answered by another howl far across the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThat set the gilded roof on the horror. Strickland dashed into Fleete’s\r\nroom. I followed, and we saw Fleete getting out of the window. He made\r\nbeast-noises in the back of his throat. He could not answer us when we\r\nshouted at him. He spat.\r\n\r\nI don’t quite remember what followed, but I think that Strickland must\r\nhave stunned him with the long boot-jack or else I should never have\r\nbeen able to sit on his chest. Fleete could not speak, he could only\r\nsnarl, and his snarls were those of a wolf, not of a man. The human\r\nspirit must have been giving way all day and have died out with the\r\ntwilight. We were dealing with a beast that had once been Fleete.\r\n\r\nThe affair was beyond any human and rational experience. I tried to say\r\n‘Hydrophobia,’ but the word wouldn’t come, because I knew that I was\r\nlying.\r\n\r\nWe bound this beast with leather thongs of the punkah-rope, and tied\r\nits thumbs and big toes together, and gagged it with a shoe-horn,\r\nwhich makes a very efficient gag if you know how to arrange it. Then we\r\ncarried it into the dining-room, and sent a man to Dumoise, the doctor,\r\ntelling him to come over at once. After we had despatched the messenger\r\nand were drawing breath, Strickland said, ‘It’s no good. This isn’t any\r\ndoctor’s work.’ I, also, knew that he spoke the truth.\r\n\r\nThe beast’s head was free, and it threw it about from side to side. Any\r\none entering the room would have believed that we were curing a wolf’s\r\npelt. That was the most loathsome accessory of all.\r\n\r\nStrickland sat with his chin in the heel of his fist, watching the beast\r\nas it wriggled on the ground, but saying nothing. The shirt had been\r\ntorn open in the scuffle and showed the black rosette mark on the left\r\nbreast. It stood out like a blister.\r\n\r\nIn the silence of the watching we heard something without mewing like\r\na she-otter. We both rose to our feet, and, I answer for myself, not\r\nStrickland, felt sick--actually and physically sick. We told each other,\r\nas did the men in Pinafore, that it was the cat.\r\n\r\nDumoise arrived, and I never saw a little man so unprofessionally\r\nshocked. He said that it was a heart-rending case of hydrophobia, and\r\nthat nothing could be done. At least any palliative measures would only\r\nprolong the agony. The beast was foaming at the mouth. Fleete, as we\r\ntold Dumoise, had been bitten by dogs once or twice. Any man who keeps\r\nhalf a dozen terriers must expect a nip now and again. Dumoise\r\ncould offer no help. He could only certify that Fleete was dying of\r\nhydrophobia. The beast was then howling, for it had managed to spit out\r\nthe shoe-horn. Dumoise said that he would be ready to certify to the\r\ncause of death, and that the end was certain. He was a good little man,\r\nand he offered to remain with us; but Strickland refused the kindness.\r\nHe did not wish to poison Dumoise’s New Year. He would only ask him not\r\nto give the real cause of Fleete’s death to the public.\r\n\r\nSo Dumoise left, deeply agitated; and as soon as the noise of the\r\ncart-wheels had died away, Strickland told me, in a whisper, his\r\nsuspicions. They were so wildly improbable that he dared not say them\r\nout aloud; and I, who entertained all Strickland’s beliefs, was so\r\nashamed of owning to them that I pretended to disbelieve.\r\n\r\n‘Even if the Silver Man had bewtiched Fleete for polluting the image of\r\nHanuman, the punishment could not have fallen so quickly.’\r\n\r\nAs I was whispering this the cry outside the house rose again, and the\r\nbeast fell into a fresh paroxysm of struggling till we were afraid that\r\nthe thongs that held it would give way.\r\n\r\n‘Watch!’ said Strickland. ‘If this happens six times I shall take the\r\nlaw into my own hands. I order you to help me.’\r\n\r\nHe went into his room and came out in a few minutes with the barrels of\r\nan old shot-gun, a piece of fishing-line, some thick cord, and his heavy\r\nwooden bedstead. I reported that the convulsions had followed the cry by\r\ntwo seconds in each case, and the beast seemed perceptibly weaker.\r\n\r\nStrickland muttered, ‘But he can’t take away the life! He can’t take\r\naway the life!’\r\n\r\nI said, though I knew that I was arguing against myself, ‘It may be a\r\ncat. It must be a cat. If the Silver Man is responsible, why does he\r\ndare to come here?’\r\n\r\nStrickland arranged the wood on the hearth, put the gun-barrels into\r\nthe glow of the fire, spread the twine on the table and broke a walking\r\nstick in two. There was one yard of fishing line, gut, lapped with wire,\r\nsuch as is used for mahseer-fishing, and he tied the two ends together\r\nin a loop.\r\n\r\nThen he said, ‘How can we catch him? He must be taken alive and unhurt.’\r\n\r\nI said that we must trust in Providence, and go out softly with\r\npolo-sticks into the shrubbery at the front of the house. The man\r\nor animal that made the cry was evidently moving round the house as\r\nregularly as a night-watchman. We could wait in the bushes till he came\r\nby and knock him over.\r\n\r\nStrickland accepted this suggestion, and we slipped out from a bath-room\r\nwindow into the front verandah and then across the carriage drive into\r\nthe bushes.\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight we could see the leper coming round the corner of\r\nthe house. He was perfectly naked, and from time to time he mewed and\r\nstopped to dance with his shadow. It was an unattractive sight, and\r\nthinking of poor Fleete, brought to such degradation by so foul a\r\ncreature, I put away all my doubts and resolved to help Strickland from\r\nthe heated gun-barrels to the loop of twine-from the loins to the head\r\nand back again---with all tortures that might be needful.\r\n\r\nThe leper halted in the front porch for a moment and we jumped out on\r\nhim with the sticks. He was wonderfully strong, and we were afraid that\r\nhe might escape or be fatally injured before we caught him. We had an\r\nidea that lepers were frail creatures, but this proved to be incorrect.\r\nStrickland knocked his legs from under him and I put my foot on his\r\nneck. He mewed hideously, and even through my riding-boots I could feel\r\nthat his flesh was not the flesh of a clean man.\r\n\r\nHe struck at us with his hand and feet-stumps. We looped the lash of a\r\ndog-whip round him, under the armpits, and dragged him backwards into\r\nthe hall and so into the dining-room where the beast lay. There we tied\r\nhim with trunk-straps. He made no attempt to escape, but mewed.\r\n\r\nWhen we confronted him with the beast the scene was beyond description.\r\nThe beast doubled backwards into a bow as though he had been poisoned\r\nwith strychnine, and moaned in the most pitiable fashion. Several other\r\nthings happened also, but they cannot be put down here.\r\n\r\n‘I think I was right,’ said Strickland. ‘Now we will ask him to cure\r\nthis case.’\r\n\r\nBut the leper only mewed. Strickland wrapped a towel round his hand\r\nand took the gun-barrels out of the fire. I put the half of the broken\r\nwalking stick through the loop of fishing-line and buckled the leper\r\ncomfortably to Strickland’s bedstead. I understood then how men and\r\nwomen and little children can endure to see a witch burnt alive; for the\r\nbeast was moaning on the floor, and though the Silver Man had no face,\r\nyou could see horrible feelings passing through the slab that took its\r\nplace, exactly as waves of heat play across red-hot iron--gun-barrels\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\nStrickland shaded his eyes with his hands for a moment and we got to\r\nwork. This part is not to be printed.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was beginning to break when the leper spoke. His mewings had\r\nnot been satisfactory up to that point. The beast had fainted from\r\nexhaustion and the house was very still. We unstrapped the leper and\r\ntold him to take away the evil spirit. He crawled to the beast and laid\r\nhis hand upon the left breast. That was all. Then he fell face down and\r\nwhined, drawing in his breath as he did so.\r\n\r\nWe watched the face of the beast, and saw the soul of Fleete coming back\r\ninto the eyes. Then a sweat broke out on the forehead and the eyes-they\r\nwere human eyes---closed. We waited for an hour but Fleete still\r\nslept. We carried him to his room and bade the leper go, giving him\r\nthe bedstead, and the sheet on the bedstead to cover his nakedness, the\r\ngloves and the towels with which we had touched him, and the whip that\r\nhad been hooked round his body. He put the sheet about him and went out\r\ninto the early morning without speaking or mewing.\r\n\r\nStrickland wiped his face and sat down. A night-gong, far away in the\r\ncity, made seven o’clock.\r\n\r\n‘Exactly four-and-twenty hours!’ said Strickland. ‘And I’ve done enough\r\nto ensure my dismissal from the service, besides permanent quarters in a\r\nlunatic asylum. Do you believe that we are awake?’\r\n\r\nThe red-hot gun-barrel had fallen on the floor and was singeing the\r\ncarpet. The smell was entirely real.\r\n\r\nThat morning at eleven we two together went to wake up Fleete. We looked\r\nand saw that the black leopard-rosette on his chest had disappeared.\r\nHe was very drowsy and tired, but as soon as he saw us, he said, ‘Oh!\r\nConfound you fellows. Happy New Year to you. Never mix your liquors. I’m\r\nnearly dead.’\r\n\r\n‘Thanks for your kindness, but you’re over time,’ said Strickland.\r\n‘To-day is the morning of the second. You’ve slept the clock round with\r\na vengeance.’\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and little Dumoise put his head in. He had come on\r\nfoot, and fancied that we were laving out Fleete.\r\n\r\n‘I’ve brought a nurse,’ said Dumoise. ‘I suppose that she can come in\r\nfor... what is necessary.’\r\n\r\n‘By all means,’ said Fleete cheerily, sitting up in bed. ‘Bring on your\r\nnurses.’\r\n\r\nDumoise was dumb. Strickland led him out and explained that there must\r\nhave been a mistake in the diagnosis. Dumoise remained dumb and left the\r\nhouse hastily. He considered that his professional reputation had been\r\ninjured, and was inclined to make a personal matter of the recovery.\r\nStrickland went out too. When he came back, he said that he had been to\r\ncall on the Temple of Hanuman to offer redress for the pollution of the\r\ngod, and had been solemnly assured that no white man had ever touched\r\nthe idol and that he was an incarnation of all the virtues labouring\r\nunder a delusion.\r\n\r\n‘What do you think?’ said Strickland.\r\n\r\nI said, ‘“There are more things . . .”’\r\n\r\nBut Strickland hates that quotation. He says that I have worn it\r\nthreadbare.\r\n\r\nOne other curious thing happened which frightened me as much as anything\r\nin all the night’s work. When Fleete was dressed he came into the\r\ndining-room and sniffed. He had a quaint trick of moving his nose when\r\nhe sniffed. ‘Horrid doggy smell, here,’ said he. ‘You should really keep\r\nthose terriers of yours in better order. Try sulphur, Strick.’\r\n\r\nBut Strickland did not answer. He caught hold of the back of a chair,\r\nand, without warning, went into an amazing fit of hysterics. It is\r\nterrible to see a strong man overtaken with hysteria. Then it struck me\r\nthat we had fought for Fleete’s soul with the Silver Man in that room,\r\nand had disgraced ourselves as Englishmen for ever, and I laughed\r\nand gasped and gurgled just as shamefully as Strickland, while Fleete\r\nthought that we had both gone mad. We never told him what we had done.\r\n\r\nSome years later, when Strickland had married and was a church-going\r\nmember of society for his wife’s sake, we reviewed the incident\r\ndispassionately, and Strickland suggested that I should put it before\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nI cannot myself see that this step is likely to clear up the mystery;\r\nbecause, in the first place, no one will believe a rather unpleasant\r\nstory, and, in the second, it is well known to every right-minded man\r\nthat the gods of the heathen are stone and brass, and any attempt to\r\ndeal with them otherwise is justly condemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF IMRAY\r\n\r\n\r\n The doors were wide, the story saith,\r\n Out of the night came the patient wraith,\r\n He might not speak, and he could not stir\r\n A hair of the Baron’s minniver--\r\n Speechless and strengthless, a shadow thin,\r\n He roved the castle to seek his kin.\r\n And oh, ‘twas a piteous thing to see\r\n The dumb ghost follow his enemy!\r\n                             THE BARON.\r\n\r\nImray achieved the impossible. Without warning, for no conceivable\r\nmotive, in his youth, at the threshold of his career he chose to\r\ndisappear from the world---which is to say, the little Indian station\r\nwhere he lived.\r\n\r\nUpon a day he was alive, well, happy, and in great evidence among the\r\nbilliard-tables at his Club. Upon a morning, he was not, and no manner\r\nof search could make sure where he might be. He had stepped out of his\r\nplace; he had not appeared at his office at the proper time, and his\r\ndogcart was not upon the public roads. For these reasons, and because\r\nhe was hampering, in a microscopical degree, the administration of the\r\nIndian Empire, that Empire paused for one microscopical moment to make\r\ninquiry into the fate of Imray. Ponds were dragged, wells were plumbed,\r\ntelegrams were despatched down the lines of railways and to the nearest\r\nseaport town-twelve hundred miles away; but Imray was not at the end of\r\nthe drag-ropes nor the telegraph wires. He was gone, and his place knew\r\nhim no more.\r\n\r\nThen the work of the great Indian Empire swept forward, because it could\r\nnot be delayed, and Imray from being a man became a mystery--such a\r\nthing as men talk over at their tables in the Club for a month, and then\r\nforget utterly. His guns, horses, and carts were sold to the highest\r\nbidder. His superior officer wrote an altogether absurd letter to\r\nhis mother, saying that Imray had unaccountably disappeared, and his\r\nbungalow stood empty.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by, my\r\nfriend Strickland, of the Police, saw fit to rent the bungalow from\r\nthe native landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss Youghal--an\r\naffair which has been described in another place--and while he\r\nwas pursuing his investigations into native life. His own life was\r\nsufficiently peculiar, and men complained of his manners and customs.\r\nThere was always food in his house, but there were no regular times for\r\nmeals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he might find\r\nat the sideboard, and this is not good for human beings. His domestic\r\nequipment was limited to six rifles, three shot-guns, five saddles, and\r\na collection of stiff-jointed mahseer-rods, bigger and stronger than the\r\nlargest salmon-rods. These occupied one-half of his bungalow, and the\r\nother half was given up to Strickland and his dog Tietjens--an enormous\r\nRampur slut who devoured daily the rations of two men. She spoke to\r\nStrickland in a language of her own; and whenever, walking abroad,\r\nshe saw things calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the\r\nQueen-Empress, she returned to her master and laid information.\r\nStrickland would take steps at once, and the end of his labours was\r\ntrouble and fine and imprisonment for other people. The natives believed\r\nthat Tietjens was a familiar spirit, and treated her with the great\r\nreverence that is born of hate and fear. One room in the bungalow was\r\nset apart for her special use. She owned a bedstead, a blanket, and a\r\ndrinking-trough, and if any one came into Strickland’s room at night her\r\ncustom was to knock down the invader and give tongue till some one\r\ncame with a light. Strickland owed his life to her, when he was on the\r\nFrontier, in search of a local murderer, who came in the gray dawn to\r\nsend Strickland much farther than the Andaman Islands. Tietjens caught\r\nthe man as he was crawling into Strickland’s tent with a dagger between\r\nhis teeth; and after his record of iniquity was established in the eyes\r\nof the law he was hanged. From that date Tietjens wore a collar of rough\r\nsilver, and employed a monogram on her night-blanket; and the blanket\r\nwas of double woven Kashmir cloth, for she was a delicate dog.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances would she be separated from Strickland; and once,\r\nwhen he was ill with fever, made great trouble for the doctors, because\r\nshe did not know how to help her master and would not allow another\r\ncreature to attempt aid. Macarnaght, of the Indian Medical Service, beat\r\nher over her head with a gun-butt before she could understand that she\r\nmust give room for those who could give quinine.\r\n\r\nA short time after Strickland had taken Imray’s bungalow, my business\r\ntook me through that Station, and naturally, the Club quarters being\r\nfull, I quartered myself upon Strickland. It was a desirable bungalow,\r\neight-roomed and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from\r\nrain. Under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling-cloth which looked just\r\nas neat as a white-washed ceiling. The landlord had repainted it when\r\nStrickland took the bungalow. Unless you knew how Indian bungalows were\r\nbuilt you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the dark\r\nthree-cornered cavern of the roof, where the beams and the underside of\r\nthe thatch harboured all manner of rats, bats, ants, and foul things.\r\n\r\nTietjens met me in the verandah with a bay like the boom of the bell of\r\nSt. Paul’s, putting her paws on my shoulder to show she was glad to see\r\nme. Strickland had contrived to claw together a sort of meal which he\r\ncalled lunch, and immediately after it was finished went out about his\r\nbusiness. I was left alone with Tietjens and my own affairs. The heat of\r\nthe summer had broken up and turned to the warm damp of the rains. There\r\nwas no motion in the heated air, but the rain fell like ramrods on the\r\nearth, and flung up a blue mist when it splashed back. The bamboos, and\r\nthe custard-apples, the poinsettias, and the mango-trees in the garden\r\nstood still while the warm water lashed through them, and the frogs\r\nbegan to sing among the aloe hedges. A little before the light failed,\r\nand when the rain was at its worst, I sat in the back verandah and\r\nheard the water roar from the eaves, and scratched myself because I was\r\ncovered with the thing called prickly-heat. Tietjens came out with\r\nme and put her head in my lap and was very sorrowful; so I gave her\r\nbiscuits when tea was ready, and I took tea in the back verandah on\r\naccount of the little coolness found there. The rooms of the house were\r\ndark behind me. I could smell Strickland’s saddlery and the oil on his\r\nguns, and I had no desire to sit among these things. My own servant came\r\nto me in the twilight, the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his\r\ndrenched body, and told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see\r\nsome one. Very much against my will, but only because of the darkness of\r\nthe rooms, I went into the naked drawing-room, telling my man to bring\r\nthe lights. There might or might not have been a caller waiting---it\r\nseemed to me that I saw a figure by one of the windows---but when the\r\nlights came there was nothing save the spikes of the rain without,\r\nand the smell of the drinking earth in my nostrils. I explained to my\r\nservant that he was no wiser than he ought to be, and went back to the\r\nverandah to talk to Tietjens. She had gone out into the wet, and I\r\ncould hardly coax her back to me; even with biscuits with sugar tops.\r\nStrickland came home, dripping wet, just before dinner, and the first\r\nthing he said was.\r\n\r\n‘Has any one called?’\r\n\r\nI explained, with apologies, that my servant had summoned me into the\r\ndrawing-room on a false alarm; or that some loafer had tried to call on\r\nStrickland, and thinking better of it had fled after giving his name.\r\nStrickiand ordered dinner, without comment, and since it was a real\r\ndinner with a white tablecloth attached, we sat down.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock Strickland wanted to go to bed, and I was tired too.\r\nTietjens, who had been lying underneath the table, rose up, and swung\r\ninto the least exposed verandah as soon as her master moved to his own\r\nroom, which was next to the stately chamber set apart for Tietjens. If a\r\nmere wife had wished to sleep out of doors in that pelting rain it would\r\nnot have mattered; but Tietjens was a dog, and therefore the better\r\nanimal. I looked at Strickland, expecting to see him flay her with\r\na whip. He smiled queerly, as a man would smile after telling some\r\nunpleasant domestic tragedy. ‘She has done this ever since I moved in\r\nhere,’ said he. ‘Let her go.’\r\n\r\nThe dog was Strickland’s dog, so I said nothing, but I felt all that\r\nStrickland felt In being thus made light of. Tietjens encamped outside\r\nmy bedroom window, and storm after storm came up, thundered on the\r\nthatch, and died away. The lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg\r\nspatters a barn-door, but the light was pale blue, not yellow; and,\r\nlooking through my split bamboo blinds, I could see the great dog\r\nstanding, not sleeping, in the verandah, the hackles alift on her back\r\nand her feet anchored as tensely as the drawn wire-rope of a suspension\r\nbridge. In the very short pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep, but\r\nit seemed that some one wanted me very urgently. He, whoever he was,\r\nwas trying to call me by name, but his voice was no more than a husky\r\nwhisper. The thunder ceased, and Tietjens went into the garden and\r\nhowled at the low moon. Somebody tried to open my door, walked about and\r\nabout through the house and stood breathing heavily in the verandahs,\r\nand just when I was falling asleep I fancied that I heard a wild\r\nhammering and clamouring above my head or on the door.\r\n\r\nI ran into Strickland’s room and asked him whether he was ill, and had\r\nbeen calling for me. He was lying on his bed half dressed, a pipe in his\r\nmouth. ‘I thought you’d come,’ he said. ‘Have I been walking round the\r\nhouse recently?’\r\n\r\nI explained that he had been tramping in the dining-room and the\r\nsmoking-room and two or three other places, and he laughed and told me\r\nto go back to bed. I went back to bed and slept till the morning, but\r\nthrough all my mixed dreams I was sure I was doing some one an injustice\r\nin not attending to his wants. What those wants were I could not tell;\r\nbut a fluttering, whispering, bolt-fumbling, lurking, loitering Someone\r\nwas reproaching me for my slackness, and, half awake, I heard the\r\nhowling of Tietjens in the garden and the threshing of the rain.\r\n\r\nI lived in that house for two days. Strickland went to his office\r\ndaily, leaving me alone for eight or ten hours with Tietjens for my only\r\ncompanion. As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable, and so\r\nwas Tietjens; but in the twilight she and I moved into the back verandah\r\nand cuddled each other for company. We were alone in the house, but none\r\nthe less it was much too fully occupied by a tenant with whom I did not\r\nwish to interfere. I never saw him, but I could see the curtains between\r\nthe rooms quivering where he had just passed through; I could hear\r\nthe chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had\r\njust quitted them; and I could feel when I went to get a book from\r\nthe dining-room that somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front\r\nverandah till I should have gone away. Tietjens made the twilight more\r\ninteresting by glaring into the darkened rooms with every hair erect,\r\nand following the motions of something that I could not see. She never\r\nentered the rooms, but her eyes moved interestedly: that was quite\r\nsufficient. Only when my servant came to trim the lamps and make all\r\nlight and habitable she would come in with me and spend her time sitting\r\non her haunches, watching an invisible extra man as he moved about\r\nbehind my shoulder. Dogs are cheerful companions.\r\n\r\nI explained to Strickland, gently as might be, that I would go over to\r\nthe Club and find for myself quarters there. I admired his hospitality,\r\nwas pleased with his guns and rods, but I did not much care for his\r\nhouse and its atmosphere. He heard me out to the end, and then smiled\r\nvery wearily, but without contempt, for he is a man who understands\r\nthings. ‘Stay on,’ he said, ‘and see what this thing means. All you have\r\ntalked about I have known since I took the bungalow. Stay on and wait.\r\nTietjens has left me. Are you going too?’\r\n\r\nI had seen him through one little affair, connected with a heathen\r\nidol, that had brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum, and I had\r\nno desire to help him through further experiences. He was a man to whom\r\nunpleasantnesses arrived as do dinners to ordinary people.\r\n\r\nTherefore I explained more clearly than ever that I liked him immensely,\r\nand would be happy to see him in the daytime; but that I did not care to\r\nsleep under his roof. This was after dinner, when Tietjens had gone out\r\nto lie in the verandah.\r\n\r\n‘’Pon my soul, I don’t wonder,’ said Strickland, with his eyes on the\r\nceiling-cloth. ‘Look at that!’\r\n\r\nThe tails of two brown snakes were hanging between the cloth and the\r\ncornice of the wall. They threw long shadows in the lamplight.\r\n\r\n‘If you are afraid of snakes of course--’ said Strickland.\r\n\r\nI hate and fear snakes, because if you look into the eyes of any snake\r\nyou will see that it knows all and more of the mystery of man’s fall,\r\nand that it feels all the contempt that the Devil felt when Adam was\r\nevicted from Eden. Besides which its bite is generally fatal, and it\r\ntwists up trouser legs.\r\n\r\n‘You ought to get your thatch overhauled,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘Give me a mahseer-rod, and we’ll poke ‘em down.’\r\n\r\n‘They’ll hide among the roof-beams,’ said Strickland. ‘I can’t stand\r\nsnakes overhead. I’m going up into the roof. If I shake ‘em down, stand\r\nby with a cleaning-rod and break their backs.’\r\n\r\nI was not anxious to assist Strickland in his work, but I took the\r\ncleaning-rod and waited in the dining-room, while Strickland brought a\r\ngardener’s ladder from the verandah, and set it against the side of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe snake-tails drew themselves up and disappeared. We could hear the\r\ndry rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy ceiling-cloth.\r\nStrickland took a lamp with him, while I tried to make clear to him\r\nthe danger of hunting roof-snakes between a ceiling-cloth and a\r\nthatch, apart from the deterioration of property caused by ripping out\r\nceiling-cloths.\r\n\r\n‘Nonsense!’ said Strickland. ‘They’re sure to hide near the walls by the\r\ncloth. The bricks are too cold for ‘em, and the heat of the room is just\r\nwhat they like.’ He put his hand to the corner of the stuff and\r\nripped it from the cornice. It gave with a great sound of tearing, and\r\nStrickland put his head through the opening into the dark of the angle\r\nof the roof-beams. I set my teeth and lifted the rod, for I had not the\r\nleast knowledge of what might descend.\r\n\r\n‘H’m!’ said Strickland, and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof.\r\n‘There’s room for another set of rooms up here, and, by Jove, some one\r\nis occupying ‘em!’\r\n\r\n‘Snakes?’ I said from below.\r\n\r\n‘No. It’s a buffalo. Hand me up the two last joints of a mahseer-rod,\r\nand I’ll prod it. It’s lying on the main roof-beam.’\r\n\r\nI handed up the rod.\r\n\r\n‘What a nest for owls and serpents! No wonder the snakes live here,’\r\nsaid Strickland, climbing farther into the roof. I could see his elbow\r\nthrusting with the rod. ‘Come out of that, whoever you are! Heads below\r\nthere! It’s falling.’\r\n\r\nI saw the ceiling-cloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a\r\nshape that was pressing it downwards and downwards towards the lighted\r\nlamp on the table. I snatched the lamp out of danger and stood back.\r\nThen the cloth ripped out from the walls, tore, split, swayed, and shot\r\ndown upon the table something that I dared not look at, till Strickland\r\nhad slid down the ladder and was standing by my side.\r\n\r\nHe did not say much, being a man of few words; but he picked up the\r\nloose end of the tablecloth and threw it over the remnants on the table.\r\n\r\n‘It strikes me,’ said he, putting down the lamp, ‘our friend Imray has\r\ncome back. Oh! you would, would you?’\r\n\r\nThere was a movement under the cloth, and a little snake wriggled out,\r\nto be back-broken by the butt of the mahseer-rod. I was sufficiently\r\nsick to make no remarks worth recording.\r\n\r\nStrickland meditated, and helped himself to drinks. The arrangement\r\nunder the cloth made no more signs of life.\r\n\r\n‘Is it Imray?’ I said.\r\n\r\nStrickland turned back the cloth for a moment, and looked.\r\n\r\n‘It is Imray,’ he said; ‘and his throat is cut from ear to ear.’\r\n\r\nThen we spoke, both together and to ourselves: ‘That’s why he whispered\r\nabout the house.’\r\n\r\nTietjens, in the garden, began to bay furiously. A little later her\r\ngreat nose heaved open the dining-room door.\r\n\r\nShe sniffed and was still. The tattered ceiling-cloth hung down almost\r\nto the level of the table, and there was hardly room to move away from\r\nthe discovery.\r\n\r\nTietjens came in and sat down; her teeth bared under her lip and her\r\nforepaws planted. She looked at Strickland.\r\n\r\n‘It’s a bad business, old lady,’ said he. ‘Men don’t climb up into the\r\nroofs of their bungalows to die, and they don’t fasten up the ceiling\r\ncloth behind ‘em. Let’s think it out.’\r\n\r\n‘Let’s think it out somewhere else,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘Excellent idea! Turn the lamps out. We’ll get into my room.’\r\n\r\nI did not turn the lamps out. I went into Strickland’s room first,\r\nand allowed him to make the darkness. Then he followed me, and we lit\r\ntobacco and thought. Strickland thought. I smoked furiously, because I\r\nwas afraid.\r\n\r\n‘Imray is back,’ said Strickland. ‘The question is---who killed Imray?\r\nDon’t talk, I’ve a notion of my own. When I took this bungalow I took\r\nover most of Imray’s servants. Imray was guileless and inoffensive,\r\nwasn’t he?’\r\n\r\nI agreed; though the heap under the cloth had looked neither one thing\r\nnor the other.\r\n\r\n‘If I call in all the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie\r\nlike Aryans. What do you suggest?’\r\n\r\n‘Call ‘em in one by one,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘They’ll run away and give the news to all their fellows,’ said\r\nStrickland. ‘We must segregate ‘em. Do you suppose your servant knows\r\nanything about it?’\r\n\r\n‘He may, for aught I know; but I don’t think it’s likely. He has only\r\nbeen here two or three days,’ I answered. ‘What’s your notion?’\r\n\r\n‘I can’t quite tell. How the dickens did the man get the wrong side of\r\nthe ceiling-cloth?’\r\n\r\nThere was a heavy coughing outside Strickland’s bedroom door. This\r\nshowed that Bahadur Khan, his body-servant, had waked from sleep and\r\nwished to put Strickland to bed.\r\n\r\n‘Come in,’ said Strickland. ‘It’s a very warm night, isn’t it?’\r\n\r\nBahadur Khan, a great, green-turbaned, six-foot Mahomedan, said that it\r\nwas a very warm night; but that there was more rain pending, which, by\r\nhis Honour’s favour, would bring relief to the country.\r\n\r\n‘It will be so, if God pleases,’ said Strickland, tugging off his boots.\r\n‘It is in my mind, Bahadur Khan, that I have worked thee remorselessly\r\nfor many days---ever since that time when thou first earnest into my\r\nservice. What time was that?’\r\n\r\n‘Has the Heaven-born forgotten? It was when Imray Sahib went secretly\r\nto Europe without warning given; and I-even I-came into the honoured\r\nservice of the protector of the poor.’\r\n\r\n‘And Imray Sahib went to Europe?’\r\n\r\n‘It is so said among those who were his servants.’\r\n\r\n‘And thou wilt take service with him when he returns?’\r\n\r\n‘Assuredly, Sahib. He was a good master, and cherished his dependants.’\r\n\r\n‘That is true. I am very tired, but I go buck-shooting to-morrow. Give\r\nme the little sharp rifle that I use for black-buck; it is in the case\r\nyonder.’\r\n\r\nThe man stooped over the case; handed barrels, stock, and fore-end to\r\nStrickland, who fitted all together, yawning dolefully. Then he reached\r\ndown to the gun-case, took a solid-drawn cartridge, and slipped it into\r\nthe breech of the ‘360 Express.\r\n\r\n‘And Imray Sahib has gone to Europe secretly! That is very strange,\r\nBahadur Khan, is it not?’\r\n\r\n‘What do I know of the ways of the white man. Heaven-born?’\r\n\r\n‘Very little, truly. But thou shalt know more anon. It has reached me\r\nthat Imray Sahib has returned from his so long journeyings, and that\r\neven now he lies in the next room, waiting his servant.’\r\n\r\n‘Sahib!’\r\n\r\nThe lamplight slid along the barrels of the rifle as they levelled\r\nthemselves at Bahadur Khan’s broad breast.\r\n\r\n‘Go and look!’ said Strickland. ‘Take a lamp. Thy master is tired, and he\r\nwaits thee. Go!’\r\n\r\nThe man picked up a lamp, and went into the dining-room, Strickland\r\nfollowing, and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle. He\r\nlooked for a moment at the black depths behind the ceiling-cloth; at the\r\nwrithing snake under foot; and last, a gray glaze settling on his face,\r\nat the thing under the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n‘Hast thou seen?’ said Strickland after a pause.\r\n\r\n‘I have seen. I am clay in the white man’s hands. What does the Presence\r\ndo?’\r\n\r\n‘Hang thee within the month. What else?’\r\n\r\n‘For killing him? Nay, Sahib, consider. Walking among us, his servants,\r\nhe cast his eyes upon my child, who was four years old. Him he\r\nbewitched, and in ten days he died of the fever--my child!’\r\n\r\n‘What said Imray Sahib?’\r\n\r\n‘He said he was a handsome child, and patted him on the head; wherefore\r\nmy child died. Wherefore I killed Imray Sahib in the twilight, when he\r\nhad come back from office, and was sleeping. Wherefore I dragged him up\r\ninto the roof-beams and made all fast behind him. The Heaven-born knows\r\nall things. I am the servant of the Heaven-born.’\r\n\r\nStrickland looked at me above the rifle, and said, in the vernacular,\r\n‘Thou art witness to this saying? He has killed.’\r\n\r\nBahadur Khan stood ashen gray in the light of the one lamp. The need for\r\njustification came upon him very swiftly. ‘I am trapped,’ he said, ‘but\r\nthe offence was that man’s. He cast an evil eye upon my child, and I\r\nkilled and hid him. Only such as are served by devils,’ he glared at\r\nTietjens, couched stolidly before him, ‘only such could know what I\r\ndid.’\r\n\r\n‘It was clever. But thou shouldst have lashed him to the beam with a\r\nrope. Now, thou thyself wilt hang by a rope. Orderly!’\r\n\r\nA drowsy policeman answered Strickland’s call. He was followed by\r\nanother, and Tietjens sat wondrous still.\r\n\r\n‘Take him to the police-station,’ said Strickland. ‘There is a case\r\ntoward.’\r\n\r\n‘Do I hang, then?’ said Bahadur Khan, making no attempt to escape, and\r\nkeeping his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\n‘If the sun shines or the water runs--yes!’ said Strickland.\r\n\r\nBahadur Khan stepped back one long pace, quivered, and stood still. The\r\ntwo policemen waited further orders.\r\n\r\n‘Go!’ said Strickland.\r\n\r\n‘Nay; but I go very swiftly,’ said Bahadur Khan. ‘Look! I am even now a\r\ndead man.’\r\n\r\nHe lifted his foot, and to the little toe there clung the head of the\r\nhalf-killed snake, firm fixed in the agony of death.\r\n\r\n‘I come of land-holding stock,’ said Bahadur Khan, rocking where he\r\nstood. ‘It were a disgrace to me to go to the public scaffold: therefore\r\nI take this way. Be it remembered that the Sahib’s shirts are correctly\r\nenumerated, and that there is an extra piece of soap in his washbasin.\r\nMy child was bewitched, and I slew the wizard. Why should you seek to\r\nslay me with the rope? My honour is saved, and--and--I die.’\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour he died, as they die who are bitten by the\r\nlittle brown karait, and the policemen bore him and the thing under the\r\ntablecloth to their appointed places. All were needed to make clear the\r\ndisappearance of Imray.\r\n\r\n‘This,’ said Strickland, very calmly, as he climbed into bed, ‘is called\r\nthe nineteenth century. Did you hear what that man said?’\r\n\r\n‘I heard,’ I answered. ‘Imray made a mistake.’\r\n\r\n‘Simply and solely through not knowing the nature of the Oriental, and\r\nthe coincidence of a little seasonal fever. Bahadur Khan had been with\r\nhim for four years.’\r\n\r\nI shuddered. My own servant had been with me for exactly that length of\r\ntime. When I went over to my own room I found my man waiting, impassive\r\nas the copper head on a penny, to pull off my boots.\r\n\r\n‘What has befallen Bahadur Khan?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘He was bitten by a snake and died. The rest the Sahib knows,’ was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n‘And how much of this matter hast thou known?’\r\n\r\n‘As much as might be gathered from One coming in in the twilight to seek\r\nsatisfaction. Gently, Sahib. Let me pull off those boots.’\r\n\r\nI had just settled to the sleep of exhaustion when I heard Strickland\r\nshouting from his side of the house--\r\n\r\n‘Tietjens has come back to her place!’\r\n\r\nAnd so she had. The great deerhound was couched statelily on her own\r\nbedstead on her own blanket, while, in the next room, the idle, empty,\r\nceiling-cloth waggled as it trailed on the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMGAY DOOLA\r\n\r\n\r\n There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,\r\n The dew on his wet robe hung heavy and chill;\r\n Ere the steamer that brought him had passed out of hearin’,\r\n He was Alderman Mike inthrojuicin’ a bill!\r\n                       AMERICAN SONG.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a King who lived on the road to Thibet, very\r\nmany miles in the Himalayas. His Kingdom was eleven thousand feet above\r\nthe sea and exactly four miles square; but most of the miles stood on\r\nend owing to the nature of the country. His revenues were rather\r\nless than four hundred pounds yearly, and they were expended in the\r\nmaintenance of one elephant and a standing army of five men. He was\r\ntributary to the Indian Government, who allowed him certain sums for\r\nkeeping a section of the Himalaya-Thibet road in repair. He further\r\nincreased his revenues by selling timber to the railway-companies; for\r\nhe would cut the great deodar trees in his one forest, and they fell\r\nthundering into the Sutlej river and were swept down to the plains three\r\nhundred miles away and became railway-ties. Now and again this King,\r\nwhose name does not matter, would mount a ringstraked horse and ride\r\nscores of miles to Simla-town to confer with the Lieutenant-Governor\r\non matters of state, or to assure the Viceroy that his sword was at the\r\nservice of the Queen-Empress. Then the Viceroy would cause a ruffle of\r\ndrums to be sounded, and the ringstraked horse and the cavalry of the\r\nState---two men in tatters--and the herald who bore the silver stick\r\nbefore the King would trot back to their own place, which lay between\r\nthe tail of a heaven-climbing glacier and a dark birch-forest.\r\n\r\nNow, from such a King, always remembering that he possessed one\r\nveritable elephant, and could count his descent for twelve hundred\r\nyears, I expected, when it was my fate to wander through his dominions,\r\nno more than mere license to live.\r\n\r\nThe night had closed in rain, and rolling clouds blotted out the lights\r\nof the villages in the valley. Forty miles away, untouched by cloud or\r\nstorm, the white shoulder of Donga Pa--the Mountain of the Council of\r\nthe Gods--upheld the Evening Star. The monkeys sang sorrowfully to each\r\nother as they hunted for dry roosts in the fern-wreathed trees, and the\r\nlast puff of the day-wind brought from the unseen villages the scent\r\nof damp wood-smoke, hot cakes, dripping undergrowth, and rotting\r\npine-cones. That is the true smell of the Himalayas, and if once it\r\ncreeps into the blood of a man, that man will at the last, forgetting\r\nall else, return to the hills to die. The clouds closed and the smell\r\nwent away, and there remained nothing in all the world except chilling\r\nwhite mist and the boom of the Sutlej river racing through the valley\r\nbelow. A fat-tailed sheep, who did not want to die, bleated piteously\r\nat my tent door. He was scuffling with the Prime Minister and the\r\nDirector-General of Public Education, and he was a royal gift to me and\r\nmy camp servants. I expressed my thanks suitably, and asked if I might\r\nhave audience of the King. The Prime Minister readjusted his turban,\r\nwhich had fallen off in the struggle, and assured me that the King\r\nwould be very pleased to see me. Therefore I despatched two bottles as a\r\nforetaste, and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation went\r\nto the King’s Palace through the wet. He had sent his army to escort me,\r\nbut the army stayed to talk with my cook. Soldiers are very much alike\r\nall the world over.\r\n\r\nThe Palace was a four-roomed and whitewashed mud and timber house, the\r\nfinest in all the hills for a day’s journey. The King was dressed in a\r\npurple velvet jacket, white muslin trousers, and a saffron-yellow turban\r\nof price. He gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the\r\npalace courtyard which was occupied by the Elephant of State. The great\r\nbeast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail, and the curve of his\r\nback stood out grandly against the mist.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister and the Director-General of Public Education were\r\npresent to introduce me, but all the court had been dismissed, lest\r\nthe two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals. The King cast a\r\nwreath of heavy-scented flowers round my neck as I bowed, and inquired\r\nhow my honoured presence had the felicity to be. I said that through\r\nseeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned\r\ninto sunshine, and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good\r\ndeeds would be remembered by the Gods. He said that since I had set my\r\nmagnificent foot in his Kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy\r\nper cent more than the average. I said that the fame of the King had\r\nreached to the four corners of the earth, and that the nations gnashed\r\ntheir teeth when they heard daily of the glories of his realm and the\r\nwisdom of his moon-like Prime Minister and lotus-like Director-General\r\nof Public Education.\r\n\r\nThen we sat down on clean white cushions, and I was at the King’s right\r\nhand. Three minutes later he was telling me that the state of the maize\r\ncrop was something disgraceful, and that the railway-companies would\r\nnot pay him enough for his timber. The talk shifted to and fro with the\r\nbottles, and we discussed very many stately things, and the King became\r\nconfidential on the subject of Government generally. Most of all he\r\ndwelt on the shortcomings of one of his subjects, who, from all I could\r\ngather, had been paralyzing the executive.\r\n\r\n‘In the old days,’ said the King, ‘I could have ordered the Elephant\r\nyonder to trample him to death. Now I must e’en send him seventy miles\r\nacross the hills to be tried, and his keep would be upon the State. The\r\nElephant eats everything.’\r\n\r\n‘What be the man’s crimes, Rajah Sahib?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘Firstly, he is an outlander and no man of mine own people. Secondly,\r\nsince of my favour I gave him land upon his first coming, he refuses to\r\npay revenue. Am I not the lord of the earth, above and below, entitled\r\nby right and custom to one-eighth of the crop? Yet this devil,\r\nestablishing himself, refuses to pay a single tax; and he brings a\r\npoisonous spawn of babes.’\r\n\r\n‘Cast him into jail,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘Sahib,’ the King answered, shifting a little on the cushions, ‘once and\r\nonly once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I was not\r\nable to go abroad. In that hour I made a vow to my God that I would\r\nnever again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of\r\nGod; for I perceived the nature of the punishment. How can I break my\r\nvow? Were it only the lopping of a hand or a foot I should not delay.\r\nBut even that is impossible now that the English have rule. One or\r\nanother of my people’--he looked obliquely at the Director-General of\r\nPublic Education--‘would at once write a letter to the Viceroy, and\r\nperhaps I should be deprived of my ruffle of drums.’\r\n\r\nHe unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver water-pipe, fitted a plain\r\namber mouthpiece, and passed his pipe to me. ‘Not content with refusing\r\nrevenue,’ he continued, ‘this outlander refuses also the begar’ (this was\r\nthe corvee or forced labour on the roads) ‘and stirs my people up to the\r\nlike treason. Yet he is, when he wills, an expert log-snatcher. There is\r\nnone better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river when\r\nthe logs stick fast.’\r\n\r\n‘But he worships strange Gods,’ said the Prime Minister deferentially.\r\n\r\n‘For that I have no concern,’ said the King, who was as tolerant as\r\nAkbar in matters of belief. ‘To each man his own God and the fire or\r\nMother Earth for us all at last. It is the rebellion that offends me.’\r\n\r\n‘The King has an army,’ I suggested. ‘Has not the King burned the man’s\r\nhouse and left him naked to the night dews?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, a hut is a hut, and it holds the life of a man. But once, I sent\r\nmy army against him when his excuses became wearisome: of their heads\r\nhe brake three across the top with a stick. The other two men ran away.\r\nAlso the guns would not shoot.’\r\n\r\nI had seen the equipment of the infantry. One-third of it was an old\r\nmuzzle-loading fowling-piece, with a ragged rust-hole where the nipples\r\nshould have been, one-third a wire-bound matchlock with a worm-eaten\r\nstock, and one-third a four-bore flint duck-gun without a flint.\r\n\r\n‘But it is to be remembered,’ said the King, reaching out for the\r\nbottle, ‘that he is a very expert log-snatcher and a man of a merry\r\nface. What shall I do to him, Sahib?’\r\n\r\nThis was interesting. The timid hill-folk would as soon have refused\r\ntaxes to their king as revenues to their Gods.\r\n\r\n‘If it be the King’s permission,’ I said, ‘I will not strike my tents\r\ntill the third day and I will see this man. The mercy of the King is\r\nGod-like, and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft. Moreover,\r\nboth the bottles and another be empty.’\r\n\r\n‘You have my leave to go,’ said the King.\r\n\r\nNext morning a crier went through the state proclaiming that there was\r\na log-jam on the river and that it behoved all loyal subjects to remove\r\nit. The people poured down from their villages to the moist warm valley\r\nof poppy-fields; and the King and I went with them. Hundreds of dressed\r\ndeodar-logs had caught on a snag of rock, and the river was bringing\r\ndown more logs every minute to complete the blockade. The water snarled\r\nand wrenched and worried at the timber, and the population of the state\r\nbegan prodding the nearest logs with a pole in the hope of starting a\r\ngeneral movement. Then there went up a shout of ‘Namgay Doola! Namgay\r\nDoola!’ and a large red-haired villager hurried up, stripping off his\r\nclothes as he ran.\r\n\r\n‘That is he. That is the rebel,’ said the King. ‘Now will the dam be\r\ncleared.’\r\n\r\n‘But why has he red hair?’ I asked, since red hair among hill-folks is\r\nas common as blue or green.\r\n\r\n‘He is an outlander,’ said the King. ‘Well done! Oh well done!’\r\n\r\nNamgay Doola had scrambled out on the jam and was clawing out the butt\r\nof a log with a rude sort of boat-hook. It slid forward slowly as an\r\nalligator moves, three or four others followed it, and the green water\r\nspouted through the gaps they had made. Then the villagers howled and\r\nshouted and scrambled across the logs, pulling and pushing the obstinate\r\ntimber, and the red head of Namgay Doola was chief among them all. The\r\nlogs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from upstream\r\nbattered the now weakening dam. All gave way at last in a smother of\r\nfoam, racing logs, bobbing black heads and confusion indescribable. The\r\nriver tossed everything before it. I saw the red head go down with\r\nthe last remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding\r\ntree-trunks. It rose close to the bank and blowing like a grampus.\r\nNamgay Doola wrung the water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the\r\nKing. I had time to observe him closely. The virulent redness of his\r\nshock head and beard was most startling; and in the thicket of hair\r\nwrinkled above high cheek bones shone two very merry blue eyes. He was\r\nindeed an outlander, but yet a Thibetan in language, habit, and attire.\r\nHe spoke the Lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the\r\ngutturals. It was not so much a lisp as an accent.\r\n\r\n‘Whence comest thou?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘From Thibet.’ He pointed across the hills and grinned. That grin went\r\nstraight to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola\r\nshook it. No pure Thibetan would have understood the meaning of the\r\ngesture. He went away to look for his clothes, and as he climbed back to\r\nhis village, I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar.\r\nIt was the whooping of Namgay Doola.\r\n\r\n‘You see now,’ said the King, ‘why I would not kill him. He is a bold\r\nman among my logs, but,’ and he shook his head like a schoolmaster, ‘I\r\nknow that before long there will be complaints of him in the court. Let\r\nus return to the Palace and do justice.’ It was that King’s custom to\r\njudge his subjects every day between eleven and three o’clock. I saw him\r\ndecide equitably in weighty matters of trespass, slander, and a little\r\nwife-stealing. Then his brow clouded and he summoned me.\r\n\r\n‘Again it is Namgay Doola,’ he said despairingly. ‘Not content with\r\nrefusing revenue on his own part, he has bound half his village by an\r\noath to the like treason. Never before has such a thing befallen me! Nor\r\nare my taxes heavy.’\r\n\r\nA rabbit-faced villager, with a blush-rose stuck behind his ear,\r\nadvanced trembling. He had been in the conspiracy, but had told\r\neverything and hoped for the King’s favour.\r\n\r\n‘O King,’ said I, ‘if it be the King’s will let this matter stand over\r\ntill the morning. Only the Gods can do right swiftly, and it may be that\r\nyonder villager has lied.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, for I know the nature of Namgay Doola; but since a guest asks let\r\nthe matter remain. Wilt thou speak harshly to this red-headed outlander?\r\nHe may listen to thee.’\r\n\r\nI made an attempt that very evening, but for the life of me I could not\r\nkeep my countenance. Namgay Doola grinned persuasively, and began to\r\ntell me about a big brown bear in a poppy-field by the river. Would I\r\ncare to shoot it? I spoke austerely on the sin of conspiracy, and the\r\ncertainty of punishment. Namgay Doola’s face clouded for a moment.\r\nShortly afterwards he withdrew from my tent, and I heard him singing to\r\nhimself softly among the pines. The words were unintelligible to me,\r\nbut the tune, like his liquid insinuating speech, seemed the ghost of\r\nsomething strangely familiar.\r\n\r\n‘Dir hane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee.’\r\n\r\nsang Namgay Doola again and again, and I racked my brain for that lost\r\ntune. It was not till after dinner that I discovered some one had cut a\r\nsquare foot of velvet from the centre of my best camera-cloth. This made\r\nme so angry that I wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the\r\nbig brown bear. I could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the\r\npoppy-field, and I waited shoulder deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn\r\nto catch him after his meal. The moon was at full and drew out the rich\r\nscent of the tasselled crop. Then I heard the anguished bellow of\r\na Himalayan cow, one of the little black crummies no bigger than\r\nNewfoundland dogs. Two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub\r\nhurried past me. I was in act to fire when I saw that they had each a\r\nbrilliant red head. The lesser animal was trailing some rope behind it\r\nthat left a dark track on the path. They passed within six feet of\r\nme, and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvet-black on their faces.\r\nVelvet-black was exactly the word, for by all the powers of moonlight\r\nthey were masked in the velvet of my camera-cloth! I marvelled and went\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning the Kingdom was in uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had gone\r\nforth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a\r\ncow belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was\r\nsacrilege unspeakable against the Holy Cow. The State desired his blood,\r\nbut he had retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and windows with\r\nbig stones, and defied the world.\r\n\r\nThe King and I and the populace approached the hut cautiously. There was\r\nno hope of capturing the man without loss of life, for from a hole in\r\nthe wall projected the muzzle of an extremely well-cared-for gun--the\r\nonly gun in the State that could shoot. Namgay Doola had narrowly missed\r\na villager just before we came up. The Standing Army stood. It could\r\ndo no more, for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from the\r\nwindows. To these were added from time to time showers of scalding\r\nwater. We saw red heads bobbing up and down in the hut. The family\r\nof Namgay Doola were aiding their sire, and blood-curdling yells of\r\ndefiance were the only answers to our prayers.\r\n\r\n‘Never,’ said the King, puffing, ‘has such a thing befallen my State.\r\nNext year I will certainly buy a little cannon.’ He looked at me\r\nimploringly.\r\n\r\n‘Is there any priest in the Kingdom to whom he will listen?’ said I, for\r\na light was beginning to break upon me.\r\n\r\n‘He worships his own God,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘We can starve him\r\nout.’\r\n\r\n‘Let the white man approach,’ said Namgay Doola from within. ‘All others\r\nI will kill. Send me the white man.’\r\n\r\nThe door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a Thibetan\r\nhut crammed with children. And every child had flaming red hair. A\r\nraw cow’s-tail lay on the floor, and by its side two pieces of black\r\nvelvet--my black velvet--rudely hacked into the semblance of masks.\r\n\r\n‘And what is this shame, Namgay Doola?’ said I.\r\n\r\nHe grinned more winningly than ever. ‘There is no shame,’ said he. ‘I\r\ndid but cut off the tail of that man’s cow. He betrayed me. I was minded\r\nto shoot him, Sahib. But not to death. Indeed not to death. Only in the\r\nlegs.’\r\n\r\n‘And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the King? Why\r\nat all?’\r\n\r\n‘By the God of my father I cannot tell,’ said Namgay Doola.\r\n\r\n‘And who was thy father?’\r\n\r\n‘The same that had this gun.’ He showed me his weapon--a Tower musket\r\nbearing date 1832 and the stamp of the Honourable East India Company.\r\n\r\n‘And thy father’s name?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘Timlay Doola,’ said he. ‘At the first, I being then a little child, it\r\nis in my mind that he wore a red coat.’\r\n\r\n‘Of that I have no doubt. But repeat the name of thy father thrice or\r\nfour times.’\r\n\r\nHe obeyed, and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech\r\ncame. ‘Thimla Dhula,’ said he excitedly. ‘To this hour I worship his\r\nGod.’\r\n\r\n‘May I see that God?’\r\n\r\n‘In a little while--at twilight time.’\r\n\r\n‘Rememberest thou aught of thy father’s speech?’\r\n\r\n‘It is long ago. But there is one word which he said often. Thus “Shun.”\r\n Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet, our hands to our sides.\r\nThus.’\r\n\r\n‘Even so. And what was thy mother?’\r\n\r\n‘A woman of the hills. We be Lepchas of Darjeeling, but me they call an\r\noutlander because my hair is as thou seest.’\r\n\r\nThe Thibetan woman, his wife, touched him on the arm gently. The long\r\nparley outside the fort had lasted far into the day. It was now close\r\nupon twilight--the hour of the Angelus. Very solemnly, the red-headed\r\nbrats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle. Namgay Doola laid\r\nhis gun against the wall, lighted a little oil lamp, and set it before a\r\nrecess in the wall. Pulling aside a curtain of dirty cloth, he revealed\r\na worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmet-badge of a long\r\nforgotten East India regiment. ‘Thus did my father,’ he said, crossing\r\nhimself clumsily. The wife and children followed suit. Then all together\r\nthey struck up the wailing chant that I heard on the hillside--\r\n\r\n Dir bane mard-i-yemen dir\r\n To weeree ala gee.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled no longer. Again and again they crooned, as if their\r\nhearts would break, their version of the chorus of the Wearing of the\r\nGreen--\r\n\r\nThey’re hanging men and women too, For the wearing of the green.\r\n\r\nA diabolical inspiration came to me. One of the brats, a boy about eight\r\nyears old, was watching me as he sang. I pulled out a rupee, held\r\nthe coin between finger and thumb and looked--only looked--at the\r\ngun against the wall. A grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension\r\noverspread the face of the child. Never for an instant stopping the\r\nsong, he held out his hand for the money, and then slid the gun to my\r\nhand. I might have shot Namgay Doola as he chanted. But I was satisfied.\r\nThe blood-instinct of the race held true. Namgay Doola drew the curtain\r\nacross the recess. Angelus was over.\r\n\r\n‘Thus my father sang. There was much more, but I have forgotten, and I\r\ndo not know the purport of these words, but it may be that the God will\r\nunderstand. I am not of this people, and I will not pay revenue.’\r\n\r\n‘And why?’\r\n\r\nAgain that soul-compelling grin. ‘What occupation would be to me between\r\ncrop and crop? It is better than scaring bears. But these people do not\r\nunderstand.’ He picked the masks from the floor, and looked in my face\r\nas simply as a child.\r\n\r\n‘By what road didst thou attain knowledge to make these devilries?’ I\r\nsaid, pointing.\r\n\r\n‘I cannot tell. I am but a Lepcha of Darjeeling, and yet the stuff--’\r\n\r\n‘Which thou hast stolen.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, surely. Did I steal? I desired it so. The stuff--the stuff--what\r\nelse should I have done with the stuff?’ He twisted the velvet between\r\nhis fingers.\r\n\r\n‘But the sin of maiming the cow--consider that.’\r\n\r\n‘That is true; but oh, Sahib, that man betrayed me and I had no\r\nthought--but the heifer’s tail waved in the moonlight and I had my\r\nknife. What else should I have done? The tail came off ere I was aware.\r\nSahib, thou knowest more than I.’\r\n\r\n‘That is true,’ said I. ‘Stay within the door. I go to speak to the\r\nKing.’\r\n\r\nThe population of the State were ranged on the hillsides. I went forth\r\nand spoke to the King.\r\n\r\n‘O King,’ said I. ‘Touching this man there be two courses open to thy\r\nwisdom. Thou canst either hang him from a tree, he and his brood, till\r\nthere remains no hair that is red within the land.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay’ said the King. ‘Why should I hurt the little children?’\r\n\r\nThey had poured out of the hut door and were making plump obeisance to\r\neverybody. Namgay Doola waited with his gun across his arm.\r\n\r\n‘Or thou canst, discarding the impiety of the cow-maiming, raise him to\r\nhonour in thy Army. He comes of a race that will not pay revenue. A red\r\nflame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that\r\nglowing hair. Make him chief of the Army. Give him honour as may befall,\r\nand full allowance of work, but look to it, O King, that neither he nor\r\nhis hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward. Feed him with words and\r\nfavour, and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of, and\r\nhe will be a bulwark of defence. But deny him even a tuft of grass for\r\nhis own. This is the nature that God has given him. Moreover he has\r\nbrethren--’\r\n\r\nThe State groaned unanimously.\r\n\r\n‘But if his brethren come, they will surely fight with each other till\r\nthey die; or else the one will always give information concerning the\r\nother. Shall he be of thy Army, O King? Choose.’\r\n\r\nThe King bowed his head, and I said, ‘Come forth, Namgay Doola, and\r\ncommand the King’s Army. Thy name shall no more be Namgay in the mouths\r\nof men, but Patsay Doola, for as thou hast said, I know.’\r\n\r\nThen Namgay Doola, new christened Patsay Doola, son of Timlay Doola,\r\nwhich is Tim Doolan gone very wrong indeed, clasped the King’s feet,\r\ncuffed the Standing Army, and hurried in an agony of contrition from\r\ntemple to temple, making offerings for the sin of cattle-maiming.\r\n\r\nAnd the King was so pleased with my perspicacity, that he offered to\r\nsell me a village for twenty pounds sterling. But I buy no villages in\r\nthe Himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the\r\nheaven-climbing glacier and the dark birch-forest.\r\n\r\nI know that breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURTRAN AND BIMI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orang-outang in the big iron cage lashed to the sheep-pen began the\r\ndiscussion. The night was stiflingly hot, and as I and Hans Breitmann,\r\nthe big-beamed German, passed him, dragging our bedding to the fore-peak\r\nof the steamer, he roused himself and chattered obscenely. He had been\r\ncaught somewhere in the Malayan Archipelago, and was going to England\r\nto be exhibited at a shilling a head. For four days he had struggled,\r\nyelled, and wrenched at the heavy bars of his prison without ceasing,\r\nand had nearly slain a lascar, incautious enough to come within reach of\r\nthe great hairy paw.\r\n\r\n‘It would be well for you, mine friend, if you was a liddle seasick,’\r\nsaid Hans Breitmann, pausing by the cage.’ You haf too much Ego in your\r\nCosmos.’\r\n\r\nThe orang-outang’s arm slid out negligently from between the bars. No\r\none would have believed that it would make a sudden snakelike rush at\r\nthe German’s breast. The thin silk of the sleeping-suit tore out; Hans\r\nstepped back unconcernedly to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close\r\nto one of the boats.\r\n\r\n‘Too much Ego,’ said he, peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged\r\ndevil, who was rending the silk to tatters.\r\n\r\nThen we laid out our bedding in the bows among the sleeping Lascars, to\r\ncatch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us. The sea was\r\nlike smoky oil, except where it turned to fire under our forefoot\r\nand whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame. There was a\r\nthunderstorm some miles away; we could see the glimmer of the lightning.\r\nThe ship’s cow, distressed by the heat and the smell of the ape-beast in\r\nthe cage, lowed unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as\r\nthat in which the look-out man answered the hourly call from the bridge.\r\nThe trampling tune of the engines was very distinct, and the jarring\r\nof the ash-lift, as it was tipped into the sea, hurt the procession of\r\nhushed noise. Hans lay down by my side and lighted a good-night cigar.\r\nThis was naturally the beginning of conversation. He owned a voice as\r\nsoothing as the wash of the sea, and stores of experiences as vast as\r\nthe sea itself; for his business in life was to wander up and down the\r\nworld, collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for\r\nGerman and American dealers. I watched the glowing end of his cigar wax\r\nand wane in the gloom, as the sentences rose and fell, till I was nearly\r\nasleep. The orang-outang, troubled by some dream of the forests of his\r\nfreedom, began to yell like a soul in purgatory, and to pluck madly at\r\nthe bars of the cage.\r\n\r\n‘If he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabout,’ said\r\nHans lazily. ‘He screams goot. See, now, how I shall tame him when he\r\nstops himself.’\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in the outcry, and from Hans’ mouth came an imitation\r\nof a snake’s hiss, so perfect that I almost sprang to my feet. The\r\nsustained murderous sound ran along the deck, and the wrenching at the\r\nbars ceased. The orang-outang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror.\r\n\r\n‘Dot stopped him,’ said Hans. ‘I learned dot trick in Mogoung Tanjong\r\nwhen I was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in Berlin. Efery\r\none in der world is afraid of der monkeys--except der snake. So I blay\r\nsnake against monkey, and he keep quite still. Dere was too much Ego in\r\nhis Cosmos. Dot is der soul-custom of monkeys. Are you asleep, or will\r\nyou listen, and I will tell a dale dot you shall not pelief?’\r\n\r\n‘There’s no tale in the wide world that I can’t believe,’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘If you haf learned pelief you haf learned somedings. Now I shall try\r\nyour pelief. Goot! When I was collecting dose liddle monkeys--it was in\r\n‘79 or ‘80, und I was in der islands of der Archipelago--over dere in\r\nder dark’--he pointed southward to New Guinea generally--‘Mein Gott! I\r\nwould sooner collect life red devils than liddle monkeys. When dey\r\ndo not bite off your thumbs dey are always dying from\r\nnostalgia--home-sick--for dey haf der imperfect soul, which is midway\r\narrested in defelopment--und too much Ego. I was dere for nearly a year,\r\nund dere I found a man dot was called Bertran. He was a Frenchman, und\r\nhe was goot man--naturalist to his bone. Dey said he was an escaped\r\nconvict, but he was naturalist, und dot was enough for me. He would call\r\nall der life beasts from der forest, und dey would come. I said he was\r\nSt. Francis of Assizi in a new dransmigration produced, und he\r\nlaughed und said he haf never preach to der fishes. He sold dem for\r\ntripang--beche-de-mer.\r\n\r\n‘Und dot man, who was king of beasts-tamer men, he had in der house\r\nshust such anoder as dot devil-animal in der cage--a great orang-outang\r\ndot thought he was a man. He haf found him when he was a child--der\r\norang-outang--und he was child und brother und opera comique all round\r\nto Betran. He had his room in dot house--not a cage, but a room--mit\r\na bed und sheets, und he would go to bed und get up in der morning und\r\nsmoke his cigar und eat his dinner mit Bertran, und walk mit him hand\r\nin hand, which was most horrible. Herr Gott! I haf seen dot beast throw\r\nhimself back in his chair und laugh when Bertran haf made fun of me.\r\nHe was NOT a beast; he was a man, und he talked to Bertran, und Bertran\r\ncomprehend, for I have seen dem. Und he was always politeful to me\r\nexcept when I talk too long to Bertran und say nodings at all to him.\r\nDen he would pull me away--dis great, dark devil, mit his enormous\r\npaws--shust as if I was a child. He was not a beast; he was a man. Dis I\r\nsaw pefore I know him three months, und Bertran he haf saw the same; and\r\nBimi, der orang-outang, haf understood us both, mit his cigar between\r\nhis big dog-teeth und der blue gum.\r\n\r\n‘I was dere a year, dere und at dere oder islands--somedimes for monkeys\r\nund somedimes for butterflies und orchits. One time Bertran says to me\r\ndot he will be married, because he haf found a girl dot was goot, und he\r\nenquire if this marrying idee was right. I would not say, pecause it was\r\nnot me dot was going to be married. Den he go off courting der girl--she\r\nwas a half-caste French girl--very pretty. Haf you got a new light for\r\nmy cigar? Ouf! Very pretty. Only I say, “Haf you thought of Bimi? If he\r\npull me away when I talk to you, what will he do to your wife? He will\r\npull her in pieces. If I was you, Bertran, I would gif my wife for\r\nwedding-present der stuff figure of Bimi.” By dot time I had learned\r\nsome dings about der monkey peoples. “Shoot him?” says Bertran. “He is\r\nyour beast,” I said; “if he was mine he would be shot now!”\r\n\r\n‘Den I felt at der back of my neck der fingers of Bimi. Mein Gott! I\r\ntell you dot he talked through dose fingers. It was der deaf-and-dumb\r\nalphabet all gomplete. He slide his hairy arm round my neck, und he tilt\r\nup my chin und looked into my face, shust to see if I understood his\r\ntalk so well as he understood mine.\r\n\r\n‘“See now dere!” says Bertran, “und you would shoot him while he is\r\ncuddlin’ you? Dot is der Teuton ingrate!”\r\n\r\n‘But I knew dot I had made Bimi a life’s-enemy, pecause his fingers haf\r\ntalk murder through the back of my neck. Next dime I see Bimi dere was a\r\npistol in my belt, und he touched it once, und I open der breech to show\r\nhim it was loaded. He haf seen der liddle monkeys killed in der woods:\r\nhe understood.\r\n\r\n‘So Bertran he was married, and he forgot clean about Bimi dot was\r\nskippin’ alone on der beach mit der half of a human soul in his belly.\r\nI was see him skip, und he took a big bough und thrash der sand till\r\nhe haf made a great hole like a grave. So I says to Bertran, “For any\r\nsakes, kill Bimi. He is mad mit der jealousy.”\r\n\r\n‘Bertran haf said “He is not mad at all. He haf obey und lofe my wife,\r\nund if she speak he will get her slippers,” und he looked at his wife\r\nagross der room. She was a very pretty girl.\r\n\r\n‘Den I said to him, “Dost dou pretend to know monkeys und dis beast dot\r\nis lashing himself mad upon der sands, pecause you do not talk to him?\r\nShoot him when he comes to der house, for he haf der light in his eye\r\ndot means killing--und killing.” Bimi come to der house, but dere was no\r\nlight in his eye. It was all put away, cunning--so cunning--und he fetch\r\nder girl her slippers, und Bertran turn to me und say, “Dost dou know\r\nhim in nine months more dan I haf known him in twelve years? Shall a\r\nchild stab his fader? I haf fed him, und he was my child. Do not speak\r\nthis nonsense to my wife or to me any more.”\r\n\r\n‘Dot next day Bertran came to my house to help me make some wood cases\r\nfor der specimens, und he tell me dot he haf left his wife a liddle\r\nwhile mit Bimi in der garden. Den I finish my cases quick, und I say,\r\n“Let us go to your houses und get a trink.” He laugh and say, “Come\r\nalong, dry mans.”\r\n\r\n‘His wife was not in der garden, und Bimi did not come when Bertran\r\ncalled. Und his wife did not come when he called, und he knocked at her\r\nbedroom door und dot was shut tight--locked. Den he look at me, und his\r\nface was white. I broke down der door mit my shoulder, und der thatch of\r\nder roof was torn into a great hole, und der sun came in upon der floor.\r\nHaf you ever seen paper in der waste-basket, or cards at whist on der\r\ntable scattered? Dere was no wife dot could be seen. I tell you dere was\r\nnodings in dot room dot might be a woman. Dere was stuff on der floor\r\nund dot was all. I looked at dese things und I was very sick; but\r\nBertran looked a liddle longer at what was upon the floor und der walls,\r\nund der hole in der thatch. Den he pegan to laugh, soft und low, und I\r\nknew und thank Gott dot he was mad. He nefer cried, he nefer prayed. He\r\nstood all still in der doorway und laugh to himself. Den he said, “She\r\nhaf locked herself in dis room, and he haf torn up der thatch. Fi donc!\r\nDot is so. We will mend der thatch und wait for Bimi. He will surely\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n‘I tell you we waited ten days in dot house, after der room was made\r\ninto a room again, und once or twice we saw Bimi comin’ a liddle way\r\nfrom der woods. He was afraid pecause he haf done wrong. Bertran called\r\nhim when he was come to look on the tenth day, und Bimi come skipping\r\nalong der beach und making noises, mit a long piece of black hair in his\r\nhands. Den Bertran laugh and say, “Fi donc!” shust as if it was a glass\r\nbroken upon der table; und Bimi come nearer, und Bertran was honey-sweet\r\nin his voice und laughed to himself. For three days he made love to\r\nBimi, pecause Bimi would not let himself be touched. Den Bimi come to\r\ndinner at der same table mit us, und the hair on his hands was all black\r\nund thick mit-mit what had dried on der hands. Bertran gave him sangaree\r\ntill Bimi was drunk and stupid, und den----’\r\n\r\nHans paused to puff at his cigar.\r\n\r\n‘And then?’ said I.\r\n\r\n‘Und den Bertran he kill him mit his hands, und I go for a walk upon der\r\nbeach. It was Bertran’s own piziness. When I come back der ape he was\r\ndead, und Bertran he was dying abofe him; but still he laughed liddle\r\nund low und he was quite content. Now you know der formula of der\r\nstrength of der orang-outang--it is more as seven to one in relation to\r\nman. But Bertran, he haf killed Bimi mit sooch dings as Gott gif him.\r\nDot was der miracle.’\r\n\r\nThe infernal clamour in the cage recommenced. ‘Aha! Dot friend of ours\r\nhaf still too much Ego in his Cosmos. Be quiet, dou!’\r\n\r\nHans hissed long and venomously. We could hear the great beast quaking\r\nin his cage.\r\n\r\n‘But why in the world didn’t you help Bertran instead of letting him be\r\nkilled?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘My friend,’ said Hans, composedly stretching himself to slumber, ‘it\r\nwas not nice even to mineself dot I should live after I haf seen dot\r\nroom mit der hole in der thatch. Und Bertran, he was her husband.\r\nGoot-night, und--sleep well.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTI GUJ--MUTINEER\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who wished to clear\r\nsome forest land for coffee-planting. When he had cut down all the\r\ntrees and burned the under-wood the stumps still remained. Dynamite is\r\nexpensive and slow-fire slow. The happy medium for stump-clearing is the\r\nlord of all beats, who is the elephant. He will either push the stump\r\nout of the ground with his tusks, if he has any, or drag it out with\r\nropes. The planter, therefore, hired elephants by ones and twos and\r\nthrees, and fell to work. The very best of all the elephants belonged to\r\nthe very worst of all the drivers or mahouts; and the superior beast’s\r\nname was Moti Guj. He was the absolute property of his mahout, which\r\nwould never have been the case under native rule, for Moti Guj was a\r\ncreature to be desired by kings; and his name, being translated, meant\r\nthe Pearl Elephant. Because the British Government was in the land,\r\nDeesa, the mahout, enjoyed his property undisturbed. He was dissipated.\r\nWhen he had made much money through the strength of his elephant, he\r\nwould get extremely drunk and give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg\r\nover the tender nails of the forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled the life\r\nout of Deesa on these occasions, for he knew that after the beating was\r\nover Deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and\r\nhis life and the liver of his soul, and give him some liquor. Moti\r\nGuj was very fond of liquor--arrack for choice, though he would drink\r\npalm-tree toddy if nothing better offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep\r\nbetween Moti Guj’s forefeet, and as Deesa generally chose the middle of\r\nthe public road, and as Moti Guj mounted guard over him and would not\r\npermit horse, foot, or cart to pass by, traffic was congested till Deesa\r\nsaw fit to wake up.\r\n\r\nThere was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter’s clearing: the\r\nwages were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj’s neck and gave him\r\norders, while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps--for he owned a magnificent\r\npair of tusks; or pulled at the end of a rope--for he had a magnificent\r\npair of shoulders, while Deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he\r\nwas the king of elephants. At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his\r\nthree hundred pounds’ weight of green food with a quart of arrack, and\r\nDeesa would take a share and sing songs between Moti Guj’s legs till it\r\nwas time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led Moti Guj down to the river,\r\nand Moti Guj lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows, while Deesa\r\nwent over him with a coir-swab and a brick. Moti Guj never mistook the\r\npounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him\r\nto get up and turn over on the other side. Then Deesa would look at his\r\nfeet, and examine his eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears\r\nin case of sores or budding ophthalmia. After inspection, the two would\r\n‘come up with a song from the sea,’ Moti Guj all black and shining,\r\nwaving a torn tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk, and Deesa\r\nknotting up his own long wet hair.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of the\r\ndesire to drink deep. He wished for an orgie. The little draughts that\r\nled nowhere were taking the manhood out of him.\r\n\r\nHe went to the planter, and ‘My mother’s dead,’ said he, weeping.\r\n\r\n‘She died on the last plantation two months ago; and she died once\r\nbefore that when you were working for me last year,’ said the planter,\r\nwho knew something of the ways of nativedom.\r\n\r\n‘Then it’s my aunt, and she was just the same as a mother to me,’ said\r\nDeesa, weeping more than ever. ‘She has left eighteen small children\r\nentirely without bread, and it is I who must fill their little\r\nstomachs,’ said Deesa, beating his head on the floor.\r\n\r\n‘Who brought you the news?’ said the planter.\r\n\r\n‘The post’ said Deesa.\r\n\r\n‘There hasn’t been a post here for the past week. Get back to your\r\nlines!’\r\n\r\n‘A devastating sickness has fallen on my village, and all my wives are\r\ndying,’ yelled Deesa, really in tears this time.\r\n\r\n‘Call Chihun, who comes from Deesa’s village,’ said the planter.’\r\nChihun, has this man a wife?’\r\n\r\n‘He!’ said Chihun. ‘No. Not a woman of our village would look at him.\r\nThey’d sooner marry the elephant.’ Chihun snorted. Deesa wept and\r\nbellowed.\r\n\r\n‘You will get into a difficulty in a minute,’ said the planter.’ Go back\r\nto your work!’\r\n\r\n‘Now I will speak Heaven’s truth’ gulped Deesa, with an inspiration. ‘I\r\nhaven’t been drunk for two months. I desire to depart in order to get\r\nproperly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation. Thus\r\nI shall cause no trouble.’\r\n\r\nA flickering smile crossed the planter’s face. ‘Deesa,’ said he, ‘you’ve\r\nspoken the truth, and I’d give you leave on the spot if anything could\r\nbe done with Moti Guj while you’re away. You know that he will only obey\r\nyour orders.’\r\n\r\n‘May the Light of the Heavens live forty thousand years. I shall be\r\nabsent but ten little days. After that, upon my faith and honour and\r\nsoul, I return. As to the inconsiderable interval, have I the gracious\r\npermission of the Heaven-born to call up Moti Guj?’\r\n\r\nPermission was granted, and, in answer to Deesa’s shrill yell, the\r\nlordly tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had\r\nbeen squirting dust over himself till his master should return.\r\n\r\n‘Light of my heart, Protector of the Drunken, Mountain of Might, give\r\near,’ said Deesa, standing in front of him.\r\n\r\nMoti Guj gave ear, and saluted with his trunk. ‘I am going away,’ said\r\nDeesa.\r\n\r\nMoti Guj’s eyes twinkled. He liked jaunts as well as his master. One\r\ncould snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then.\r\n\r\n‘But you, you fubsy old pig, must stay behind and work.’\r\n\r\nThe twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted. He hated\r\nstump-hauling on the plantation. It hurt his teeth.\r\n\r\n‘I shall be gone for ten days, O Delectable One. Hold up your near\r\nforefoot and I’ll impress the fact upon it, warty toad of a dried\r\nmud-puddle.’ Deesa took a tent-peg and banged Moti Guj ten times on the\r\nnails. Moti Guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot.\r\n\r\n‘Ten days,’ said Deesa, ‘you must work and haul and root trees as Chihun\r\nhere shall order you. Take up Chihun and set him on your neck!’ Moti Guj\r\ncurled the tip of his trunk, Chihun put his foot there and was swung\r\non to the neck. Deesa handed Chihun the heavy ankus, the iron\r\nelephant-goad.\r\n\r\nChihun thumped Moti Guj’s bald head as a paviour thumps a kerbstone.\r\n\r\nMoti Guj trumpeted.\r\n\r\n‘Be still, hog of the backwoods. Chihun’s your mahout for ten days. And\r\nnow bid me good-bye, beast after mine own heart. Oh, my lord, my king!\r\nJewel of all created elephants, lily of the herd, preserve your honoured\r\nhealth; be virtuous. Adieu!’\r\n\r\nMoti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into the air twice.\r\nThat was his way of bidding the man good-bye.\r\n\r\n‘He’ll work now,’ said Dessa to the planter. ‘Have I leave to go?’\r\n\r\nThe planter nodded, and Deesa dived into the woods. Moti Guj went back\r\nto haul stumps.\r\n\r\nChihun was very kind to him, but he felt unhappy and forlorn\r\nnotwithstanding. Chihun gave him balls of spices, and tickled him under\r\nthe chin, and Chihun’s little baby cooed to him after work was over,\r\nand Chihun’s wife called him a darling; but Moti Guj was a bachelor by\r\ninstinct, as Deesa was. He did not understand the domestic emotions. He\r\nwanted the light of his universe back again--the drink and the drunken\r\nslumber, the savage beatings and the savage caresses.\r\n\r\nNone the less he worked well, and the planter wondered. Deesa had\r\nvagabonded along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his\r\nown caste and, drinking, dancing, and tippling, had drifted past all\r\nknowledge of the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the eleventh day dawned, and there returned no Deesa.\r\nMoti Guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint. He swung clear,\r\nlooked round, shrugged his shoulders, and began to walk away, as one\r\nhaving business elsewhere.\r\n\r\n‘Hi! ho! Come back, you,’ shouted Chihun. ‘Come back, and put me on your\r\nneck, Misborn Mountain. Return, Splendour of the Hillsides. Adornment of\r\nall India, heave to, or I’ll bang every toe off your fat fore-foot!’\r\n\r\nMoti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after him with a\r\nrope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears forward, and Chihun knew\r\nwhat that meant, though he tried to carry it off with high words.\r\n\r\n‘None of your nonsense with me,’ said he. ‘To your pickets, Devil-son.’\r\n\r\n‘Hrrump!’ said Moti Guj, and that was all--that and the forebent ears.\r\n\r\nMoti Guj put his hands in his pockets, chewed a branch for a toothpick,\r\nand strolled about the clearing, making jest of the other elephants, who\r\nhad just set to work.\r\n\r\nChihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came out with\r\na dog-whip and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid the white man\r\nthe compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the\r\nclearing and ‘Hrrumping’ him into the verandah. Then he stood outside\r\nthe house chuckling to himself, and shaking all over with the fun of it,\r\nas an elephant will.\r\n\r\n‘We’ll thrash him,’ said the planter. ‘He shall have the finest\r\nthrashing that ever elephant received. Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve\r\nfoot of chain apiece, and tell them to lay on twenty blows.’\r\n\r\nKala Nag--which means Black Snake--and Nazim were two of the biggest\r\nelephants in the lines, and one of their duties was to administer the\r\ngraver punishments, since no man can beat an elephant properly.\r\n\r\nThey took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their trunks as they\r\nsidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between them. Moti Guj had\r\nnever, in all his life of thirty-nine years, been whipped, and he did\r\nnot intend to open new experiences. So he waited, weaving his head from\r\nright to left, and measuring the precise spot in Kala Nag’s fat side\r\nwhere a blunt tusk would sink deepest. Kala Nag had no tusks; the chain\r\nwas his badge of authority; but he judged it good to swing wide of Moti\r\nGuj at the last minute, and seem to appear as if he had brought out the\r\nchain for amusement. Nazim turned round and went home early. He did not\r\nfeel fighting-fit that morning, and so Moti Guj was left standing alone\r\nwith his ears cocked.\r\n\r\nThat decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled back to\r\nhis inspection of the clearing. An elephant who will not work, and is\r\nnot tied up, is not quite so manageable as an eighty-one ton gun loose\r\nin a heavy sea-way. He slapped old friends on the back and asked them if\r\nthe stumps were coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning\r\nlabour and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long ‘nooning’; and,\r\nwandering to and fro, thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown,\r\nwhen he returned to his pickets for food.\r\n\r\n‘If you won’t work you shan’t eat,’ said Chihun angrily. ‘You’re a wild\r\nelephant, and no educated animal at all. Go back to your jungle.’\r\n\r\nChihun’s little brown baby, rolling on the floor of the hut, stretched\r\nits fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway. Moti Guj knew well that\r\nit was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung out his trunk with\r\na fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby threw itself shouting\r\nupon it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was\r\ncrowing in the air twelve feet above his father’s head.\r\n\r\n‘Great Chief!’ said Chihun. ‘Flour cakes of the best, twelve in number,\r\ntwo feet across, and soaked in rum shall be yours on the instant, and\r\ntwo hundred pounds’ weight of fresh-cut young sugar-cane therewith.\r\nDeign only to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart\r\nand my life to me.’\r\n\r\nMoti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet, that\r\ncould have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun’s hut, and waited for his\r\nfood. He ate it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj dozed, and\r\nthought of Deesa. One of many mysteries connected with the elephant is\r\nthat his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives. Four\r\nor five hours in the night suffice--two just before midnight, lying down\r\non one side; two just after one o’clock, lying down on the other. The\r\nrest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long\r\ngrumbling soliloquies.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for a\r\nthought had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in\r\nthe dark forest with none to look after him. So all that night he chased\r\nthrough the undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears. He\r\nwent down to the river and blared across the shallows where Deesa used\r\nto wash him, but there was no answer. He could not find Deesa, but he\r\ndisturbed all the elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened to death\r\nsome gypsies in the woods.\r\n\r\nAt dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very drunk indeed,\r\nand he expected to fall into trouble for outstaying his leave. He drew a\r\nlong breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still\r\nuninjured; for he knew something of Moti Guj’s temper; and reported\r\nhimself with many lies and salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his pickets for\r\nbreakfast. His night exercise had made him hungry.\r\n\r\n‘Call up your beast,’ said the planter, and Deesa shouted in the\r\nmysterious elephant-language, that some mahouts believe came from China\r\nat the birth of the world, when elephants and not men were masters. Moti\r\nGuj heard and came. Elephants do not gallop. They move from spots at\r\nvarying rates of speed. If an elephant wished to catch an express train\r\nhe could not gallop, but he could catch the train. Thus Moti Guj was\r\nat the planter’s door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his\r\npickets. He fell into Deesa’s arms trumpeting with joy, and the man and\r\nbeast wept and slobbered over each other, and handled each other from\r\nhead to heel to see that no harm had befallen.\r\n\r\n‘Now we will get to work,’ said Deesa. ‘Lift me up, my son and my joy.’\r\n\r\nMoti Guj swung him up and the two went to the coffee-clearing to look\r\nfor irksome stumps.\r\n\r\nThe planter was too astonished to be very angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL’ENVOI\r\n\r\n\r\n   My new-cut ashlar takes the light\r\n     Where crimson-blank the windows flare;\r\n   By my own work, before the night,\r\n    Great Overseer, I make my prayer.\r\n\r\n   If there be good in that I wrought,\r\n     Thy hand compelled it, Master, Thine;\r\n   Where I have failed to meet Thy thought\r\n     I know, through Thee, the blame is mine.\r\n\r\n   One instant’s toil to Thee denied\r\n     Stands all Eternity’s offence,\r\n   Of that I did with Thee to guide\r\n     To Thee, through Thee, be excellence.\r\n\r\n   Who, lest all thought of Eden fade,\r\n     Bring’st Eden to the craftsman’s brain,\r\n   Godlike to muse o’er his own trade\r\n     And Manlike stand with God again.\r\n\r\n   The depth and dream of my desire,\r\n     The bitter paths wherein I stray,\r\n   Thou knowest Who hast made the Fire,\r\n     Thou knowest Who hast made the Clay.\r\n\r\n   One stone the more swings to her place\r\n     In that dread Temple of Thy Worth\r\n   --It is enough that through Thy grace\r\n     I saw naught common on Thy earth.\r\n\r\n   Take not that vision from my ken;\r\n     Oh whatso’er may spoil or speed,\r\n   Help me to need no aid from men\r\n     That I may help such men as need!",
