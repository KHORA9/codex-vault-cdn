Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMORY OF MY WIFE WHO SERVED ME FOR YEARS BOTH AS EYESIGHT AND\r\nAS WRITING-ARM AND BY WHOSE HAND THE FOLLOWING PAGES WERE IN LARGE PART\r\nTRANSCRIBED THIS WORK IS DEDICATED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a previous volume I undertook to describe, or rather to indicate,\r\nthe methods of the production and distribution of the earlier\r\nliterature of the world and to sketch out the relations which existed\r\nbetween the author and his public during the ages known, rather\r\nvaguely, as classic, that is, in the periods of literary activity in\r\nGreece and ancient Rome. The materials for such a record were at best\r\nbut fragmentary, and it was doubtless the case that, in a first attempt\r\nof the kind, I failed to get before me not a few of the references\r\nwhich are scattered through the works of classic writers, and which\r\nin any fairly complete presentation of the subject ought to have been\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\nImperfect as my study was, I felt, however, that I was justified in\r\nbasing upon it certain general conclusions. It seems evident that in\r\nGreece, even during the period of the highest literary development,\r\nthere did not exist anything that could be described as a system for\r\nthe production and distribution of books. The number of copies of any\r\nwork of Greek literature available for the use of the general public\r\nmust at any time have been exceedingly limited, and it would probably\r\nbe safe to say that, before the development of Alexandria as a centre\r\nof book-production, no such thing as a reading public existed. The few\r\nmanuscripts that had been produced, and that possessed any measure\r\nof authenticity, were contained in royal archives or in such a State\r\ncollection as that of Athens, or in the studies of the small group of\r\nscholarly teachers whose fame was sometimes in part due to the fact\r\nthat they were owners of books.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary writers, including the authors of works treasured\r\nas masterpieces through all later ages, were not only content to do\r\ntheir work without any thought of material compensation, but appear\r\nto have been strangely oblivious of what would seem to us to be the\r\nordinary practical measures for the preservation and circulation of\r\ntheir productions. The only reward for which they could look was fame\r\nwith their own generation, and even for this it would seem that some\r\neffective distribution of their compositions was essential. The thought\r\nof preserving their work for the appreciation of future generations\r\nseems to have weighed with them but little. The ambition or ideal of\r\nthe author appears to have been satisfied when his composition received\r\nin his own immediate community the honour of dramatic presentation\r\nor of public recitation. If his fellow citizens had accorded the\r\napprobation of the laurel crown, the approval of the outer world or of\r\nfuture generations was a matter of trifling importance. The fact that,\r\nnotwithstanding this lack of ambition or incentive on the part of the\r\nauthors, the non-existence of a reading public, and the consequent\r\nabsence of any adequate machinery for the production and distribution\r\nof books, the knowledge of the “laurel-crowned” works, both of the\r\nearlier poets and of contemporary writers, should have been so widely\r\ndiffused throughout the Greek community, is evidence that the public\r\ninterest in dramatic performances and in the recitations of public\r\nreciters (“rhapsodists”) made, for an active-minded people like the\r\nGreeks, a very effective substitute for the literary enlightenment\r\ngiven to later generations by means of the written or the printed word.\r\n\r\nA systematised method of book-production we find first in Alexandria,\r\nwhere it had been developed, if not originally instituted, by the\r\nintelligent and all-powerful interest of the Ptolemaic kings, but\r\nthere appears to be no evidence that, even in Alexandria, which for\r\nthe greater part of two centuries was the great book-producing mart of\r\nthe world, was there any practice of compensation for authors. It is\r\nto be borne in mind, however, in this connection, that, with hardly\r\nan exception, the manuscripts produced in Alexandria were copies of\r\nbooks accepted as classics, the works of writers long since dead. For\r\nthe editors of what might be called the Alexandrian editions of Greek\r\nclassics, compensation was provided in the form of _honoraria_ from the\r\ntreasury of the Museum library or of salaried positions in the Museum\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nIn Rome, during the Augustan period, we find record of a well organised\r\nbody of publishers utilising connections with Athens, with Asia Minor,\r\nand with Alexandria, for the purpose of importing Greek manuscripts and\r\nof collecting trained Greek scribes, and carrying on an active trade\r\nin the distribution of books not only with the neighbouring cities of\r\nItaly, of Spain, and of Gaul, but with such far off corners of the\r\nempire as the Roman towns in Britain. There are not a few references in\r\nthe literature of this period, and particularly in the productions of\r\nsociety writers like Martial and Horace, to the relations of authors\r\nwith their publishers and to the business interests retained by authors\r\nin the sale of their books. This Augustan age presents, in fact, the\r\nfirst example in the history of publishing, of a body of literature,\r\nproduced by contemporary writers, being manifolded and distributed\r\nunder an effective publishing and bookselling machinery, so as to\r\nreach an extensive and widely separated reading public. When the Roman\r\ngentleman in his villa near Massilia (in Gaul), Colonia (on the Rhine),\r\nor Eboracum (in far off Britain), is able to order through the imperial\r\npost copies of the latest ode of Horace or satire of Martial, we have\r\nthe beginnings of an effective publishing organisation. It is at\r\nthis time also that we first find record of the names of noteworthy\r\npublishers, the bookmakers in Athens and in Alexandria having left\r\ntheir names unrecorded. It is the period of Atticus, of Tryphon, and of\r\nthe Sosii. Concerning the matter of the arrangements with the authors,\r\nor the extent of any compensation secured by them, the information is\r\nat best but scanty and often confusing. It seems evident, however,\r\nthat, apart from the aid afforded by imperial favour, by the interest\r\nof some provincial ruler of literary tendencies, or by the bounty of a\r\nwealthy private patron like Mæcenas, the rewards of literary producers\r\nwere both scanty and precarious.\r\n\r\nWith the downfall of the Roman Empire, the organised book-trade of\r\nRome and of the great cities of the Roman provinces came to an end.\r\nThis trade had of necessity been dependent upon an effective system of\r\ncommunication and of transportation, a system which required for its\r\nmaintenance the well built and thoroughly guarded roads of the empire;\r\nwhile it also called for the existence of a wealthy and cultivated\r\nleisure class, a class which during the periods of civil war and of\r\nbarbaric invasions rapidly disappeared. Long before the reign of the\r\nlast of the Roman emperors, original literary production had in great\r\npart ceased and the trade in the books of an earlier period had been\r\nmaterially curtailed; and by 476, when Augustulus was driven out by the\r\ntriumphant Odovacar, the literary activities of the capital were very\r\nnearly at a close.\r\n\r\nIn the following study I have taken up the account of the production\r\nof books in Europe from the time of the downfall of the Empire of the\r\nWest. I have endeavoured to show by what means, after the disappearance\r\nof the civilisation of the Roman State, were preserved the fragments of\r\nclassic literature that have remained for the use of modern readers,\r\nand to what agencies were due the maintenance, throughout the\r\nconfusion and social disorganisation of the early Middle Ages, of any\r\nintellectual interest or literary activities.\r\n\r\nI find such agencies supplied in the first place by the scribes\r\nof the Roman Church, the organisation of which had replaced as a\r\ncentral civilising influence the power of the lost Roman Empire. The\r\n_scriptoria_ of the monasteries rendered the service formerly given by\r\nthe copyists of the book-shops or of the country houses, while their\r\n_armaria_, or book-chests, had to fill the place of the destroyed or\r\nscattered libraries of the Roman cities or the Roman villas. The work\r\nof the scribes was now directed not by an Augustus, a Mæcenas, or\r\nan Atticus, but by a Cassiodorus, a Benedict, or a Gregory, and the\r\nincentive to literary labour was no longer the laurel crown of the\r\ncircus, the favours of a patron, or the _honoraria_ of the publishers,\r\nbut the glory of God and the service of the Church. Upon these agencies\r\ndepended the existence of literature during the seven long centuries\r\nbetween the fall of the Western Empire and the beginning of the work of\r\nthe universities, and, in fact, for many years after the foundation of\r\nthe universities of Bologna and of Paris, the book-production of the\r\nmonasteries continued to be of material importance in connection with\r\nthe preservation of literature.\r\n\r\nIn a study of the organisation of the earliest book-trade of Bologna\r\nand Paris and of the method under which the text-books for the\r\nuniversities were produced and supplied, I have attempted to indicate\r\nthe part played by the universities in the history of literary\r\nproduction. In a later chapter I have presented sketches of one or two\r\nof the more noteworthy of the manuscript dealers, who carried on, for\r\na couple of centuries prior to the invention of printing, the business\r\nof supplying books to the increasing circles of readers outside of the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nIn 1450 comes the invention of printing, which in revolutionising the\r\nmethods of distributing intellectual productions, exercised such a\r\ncomplex and far-reaching influence on the thought and on the history\r\nof mankind. I have described with some detail the careers of certain\r\nof the earlier printer-publishers of Europe, and have been interested\r\nin noting how important and distinctive were the services rendered by\r\nthese publishers to scholarship and to literature.\r\n\r\nThe concluding chapter sketches the growth of the conception of the\r\nidea of property in literature, and the gradual development and\r\nextension throughout the States of Europe of the system of privileges\r\nwhich formed the precedent and the foundations for the modern system of\r\nthe law of literature and of interstate copyright legislation. I have\r\ntaken pleasure in pointing out that the responsibility for securing\r\nthis preliminary recognition of property in literary productions\r\nand of the property rights of literary producers rested with the\r\nprinter-publishers, and that the shaping of the beginnings of a\r\ncopyright system for Europe is due to their efforts. It was they also\r\nwho bore the chief burden of the contest, which extended over several\r\ncenturies, for the freedom of the press from the burdensome censorship\r\nof Church and State, a censorship which in certain communities appeared\r\nlikely for a time to throttle literary production altogether. I can\r\nbut think that the historians of literature and the students of the\r\nsocial and political conditions on which literary production is so\r\nlargely dependent, have failed to do full justice to men like Aldus,\r\nthe Estiennes, Froben, Koberger, and Plantin, who fought so sturdily\r\nagainst the pretensions of pope, bishop, or monarch to stand between\r\nthe printing-press and the people and to decide what should and what\r\nshould not be printed.\r\n\r\nI have thought it worth while, in giving the business history of these\r\nold-time publishers, to present the lists of their more characteristic\r\npublications,--lists which seem to me to possess pertinence and value\r\nas giving an impression of the nature and the range of the literary\r\ninterests of the time and of the particular community in which the\r\npublisher was working, while they are also, of course, indicative\r\nof the personal characteristics of the publisher himself. When we\r\nfind Aldus in Venice devoting his presses almost exclusively to\r\nclassical literature, and in the classics, so largely to Greek; while\r\nin Basel and Nuremberg the early printers are producing the works\r\nof the Church Fathers, in Paris the first Estienne (in the face of\r\nthe fierce opposition of the theologians) is multiplying editions of\r\nthe Scriptures, and in London, Caxton and his immediate successors,\r\ndisregarding both the literature of the old world and the writings\r\nof the Church, are presenting to the English public a long series of\r\nromances and _fabliaux_,--we may understand that we have to do not with\r\na series of accidental publishing selections, but with the results of\r\na definite purpose and policy on the part of capable and observing\r\nmen, a policy which gives an indication of the nature and interests\r\nof their several communities, while it characterises also the aims\r\nand the individual ideals of the publishers themselves. Some of these\r\nearlier publishers were willing simply to produce the books for which\r\nthe people about them were asking, while others, with a higher ambition\r\nand a larger feeling of responsibility, proposed themselves to educate\r\na book-reading and a book-buying public, and thus to create the demand\r\nfor the higher literature which their presses were prepared to supply.\r\n\r\nThese earlier printer-publishers took upon themselves, in fact, the\r\nresponsibility which had previously rested with the universities,\r\nand, back of the universities, with the monasteries, of selecting the\r\nliterature that was to be utilised by the community and through which\r\nthe intellectual life of the generation was to be in large part shaped\r\nand directed. They thus took their place in the series of literary\r\nagencies by means of which the world’s literature had been selected,\r\npreserved, and rendered available for mankind, a chain which included\r\nsuch diverse and widely separated links as the Ptolemies of Alexandria,\r\nthe princely patrons of Rome, Cassiodorus, S. Benedict and his\r\nmonasteries, the schools of Charlemagne and Alcuin, the universities of\r\nBologna and Paris, and, finally, the printer-publishers who utilised\r\nthe great discovery of Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nThe fact that, during both the manuscript period and the first two\r\ncenturies of printing, the writings of Cicero were reproduced far more\r\nlargely than those of any other of the Roman writers, is interesting\r\nas indicating a distinct literary preference on the part of successive\r\ngenerations both of producers and of readers. The pre-eminence of\r\nAristotle in the lists of the mediæval issues of the Greek classics\r\nhas, I judge, a different significance. Aristotle stood for a school\r\nof philosophy, the teachings of which had in the main been accepted by\r\nthe Church, and copies of his writings were required for the use of\r\nstudents. The continued demand for the works of Cicero depended upon no\r\nsuch adventitious aid, and can, therefore, fairly be credited to their\r\nperennial value as literature.\r\n\r\nMy readers will bear in mind that I have not undertaken any such\r\nimpossible task as a history of literary production, or even a record\r\nof all the factors which controlled literary production. I have\r\nattempted simply to present a study of certain conditions in the\r\nhistory of the manifolding and distribution of books by which the\r\nproduction and effectiveness of literature was very largely influenced\r\nand determined, and under which the conception of such a thing as\r\nliterary property gradually developed. The recognition of a just\r\nrequirement or of an existing injustice must, of course, always precede\r\nthe framing of legislation to meet the requirement or to remedy the\r\ninjustice, and the conception of literary property and a recognition\r\nof the inherent rights (and of the existing wrongs) of literary\r\nproducers had to be arrived at before copyright legislation could be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nI have specified as the limit of the present treatise the close of the\r\nseventeenth century, although I have found it convenient in certain\r\nchapters to make reference to events of a somewhat later date. It has\r\nbeen my purpose, however, to present a study of the conditions of\r\nliterary production in Europe prior to copyright law, and the copyright\r\nlegislation of Europe may be said to begin with the English statute of\r\n1710, known as the Act of Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nI trust that in the near future some competent authority may find\r\nhimself interested in preparing a history of copyright law, and I shall\r\nbe well pleased if the present volumes may be accepted by the historian\r\nof copyright and by the students of the subject as forming a suitable\r\ngeneral introduction to such a history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n  PREFACE                                                             v\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY                                                     xvii\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.--BOOKS IN MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTORY                                                         3\r\n\r\n  I.--THE MAKING OF BOOKS IN THE MONASTERIES                          16\r\n    Cassiodorus and S.

Jerome, in his cell at Bethlehem, was labouring\r\nat his _Commentaries on Ezekiel_, while it was the downfall of the\r\nimperial city which incited S. Augustine to begin the composition\r\nof his greatest work, _The City of God_: “the greatest city of the\r\nworld has fallen in ruin, but the City of God abideth forever.” The\r\ntreatise required for its completion twenty-two books. “The influence\r\nof France and of the printing-press,” remarks Hodgkin, “have combined\r\nto make impossible the production of another _De Civitate Dei_. The\r\nmultiplicity of authors compels the controversialist who would now\r\nobtain a hearing, to speak promptly and concisely. The examples of\r\nPascal and of Voltaire teach him that he must speak with point and\r\nvivacity.”[1] S. Augustine was probably the most voluminous writer of\r\nthe earlier Christian centuries. He was the author of no less than\r\n232 books, in addition to many tractates or homilies and innumerable\r\nepistles.[2] His literary work was continued even during the siege\r\nof Hippo by the Vandals, and he died in Hippo (in 431), in his\r\nseventy-sixth year, while the siege was still in progress.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the lack of historical records of the time, I will again\r\nquote Hodgkin, who, in his monumental work on _Italy and Her Invaders_,\r\nhas himself done so much to make good the deficiency: “It is perhaps\r\nnot surprising that in Italy itself there should have been during the\r\nfifth century an utter absence of the instinct which leads men to\r\nrecord for the benefit of posterity events which are going on around\r\nthem. When history was making itself at such breathless speed and in\r\nsuch terrible fashion, the leisure, the inclination, the presence of\r\nmind necessary for writing history might well be wanting. He who would\r\nunder happier auspices have filled up the interval between the bath and\r\nthe tennis court by reclining on the couch in the winter portico of\r\nhis villa and there languidly dictating to his slave the true story of\r\nthe abdication of Avitus, or the death of Anthemius, was himself now a\r\nslave keeping sheep in the wilderness under a Numidian sun or shrinking\r\nunder the blows of one of the rough soldiers of Gaiseric.”\r\n\r\nHodgkin finds it more difficult to understand “why the learned and\r\nleisurely provincial of Greece, whose country for nearly a century and\r\na half (395-539) escaped the horrors of hostile invasion, and who had\r\nto inspire them the grandest literary traditions in the world, should\r\nhave left unwritten the story of the downfall of Rome.”\r\n\r\n“The fact seems to be,” he goes on to say, “that at this time all that\r\nwas left of literary instinct and historiographic power in the world\r\nhad concentrated itself on theological (we cannot call it religious)\r\ncontroversy, and what tons of worthless material the ecclesiastical\r\nhistorians and controversialists of the time have left us!... Blind,\r\nmost of them, to the meaning of the mighty drama which was being\r\nenacted on the stage of the world ... they have left us scarcely a\r\nhint as to the inner history of the vast revolution which settled\r\nthe Teuton in the lands of the Latin.... One man alone gives us that\r\ndetailed information concerning the thoughts, characters, persons of\r\nthe actors in the great drama which can make the dry bones of the\r\nchronologer live. This is Caius Sollius Apollinaris Sidonius, man of\r\nletters, imperial functionary, country gentleman, and bishop, who,\r\nnotwithstanding much manifest weakness of character and a sort of\r\nepigrammatic dulness of style, is still the most interesting literary\r\nfigure of the fifth century.”[3]\r\n\r\nSidonius was born at Lyons, A.D. 430. His father, grandfather, and\r\ngreat-grandfather had all served as Prætorian Prefects in Gaul, in\r\nwhich province his own long life was passed. In 472, Sidonius became\r\nBishop of Arverni, and from that time, as he rather naïvely tells us,\r\nhe gave up (as unbecoming ecclesiastical responsibilities) the writing\r\nof compositions “based on pagan models.” In 475, the year before the\r\nlast of the western emperors, Augustulus, was driven from Rome by\r\nOdovacar,[4] the Herulian, the Visigoth king, Euric, became master\r\nof Auvergne. Sidonius was at first banished, but in 479 was restored\r\nto his diocese, and continued his work there as bishop and as writer\r\nuntil his death, ten years later. At the time of the death of Sidonius,\r\nCassiodorus, who was, during the succeeding eighty years, to have part\r\nin so much of the eventful history of Italy, was ten years old. There\r\nare some points of similarity in the careers of the two men. Both were\r\nof noble family and both began their active work as officials, one of\r\nthe Empire, the other of the Gothic kingdom of Italy, while both also\r\nbecame ecclesiastics. Each saw his country taken possession of by a\r\nforeign invader, and for the purpose of serving his countrymen, (with\r\nwhich purpose may very possibly have been combined some motives of\r\npersonal ambition,) each was able and willing to make himself useful\r\nto the new ruler and thus to retain official position and influence;\r\nand finally, both had literary facility and ambition, and, holding in\r\nregard the works of the great classic writers, endeavoured to model\r\nupon these works the style of their own voluminous compositions.\r\nThe political work of Cassiodorus was of course, however, much the\r\nmore noteworthy and important, as Sidonius could hardly claim to be\r\nconsidered a statesman.\r\n\r\nIn their work as authors, the compositions of Sidonius are, as I judge\r\nfrom the description, to be ranked higher in literary quality than\r\nthose of the later writer, and to have been more successful also in\r\nfollowing the style of classic models. The style of Cassiodorus is\r\ndescribed as both verbose and grandiloquent. In his ecclesiastical,\r\nor rather his monastic work, taken up after half a century of active\r\npolitical life, it was the fortune of Cassiodorus, as will be described\r\nlater, to exercise an influence which continued for centuries, and\r\nwhich was possibly more far-reaching than was exerted by the career of\r\nany abbot or bishop in the later history of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe careers of both Sidonius and Cassiodorus have a special interest\r\nbecause the two men held rather an exceptional position between the\r\nlife of the old empire which they survived and that of the new Europe\r\nof the Middle Ages, the beginning of which they lived to see.\r\n\r\nOf the writings of Sidonius, Hodgkin speaks as follows: “A careful\r\nperusal of the three volumes of the Letters and Poems of Sidonius\r\n(written between the years 455 and 490) reveals to us the fact that\r\nin Gaul the air still teems with intellectual life, that authors were\r\nstill writing, amanuenses transcribing, friends complimenting or\r\ncriticising, and all the cares and pleasures of literature filling the\r\nminds of large classes of men just as when no empires were sinking\r\nand no strange nationalities suddenly arising around them.... A\r\nlong list of forgotten philosophers did exist in that age, and their\r\nworks, produced in lavish abundance, seem to have had no lack of eager\r\nstudents.”\r\n\r\nAs an example of the literary interests of a country gentleman in Gaul,\r\nHodgkin quotes a letter of Sidonius, written about 469: “Here too [_i.\r\ne._ in a country house in Gaul] were books in plenty; you might fancy\r\nyou were looking at the breast-high book-shelves (_plantei_) of the\r\ngrammarians, or the wedge-shaped cases (_cunei_) of the Athenæum, or\r\nthe well-filled cupboards (_armaria_) of the booksellers. I observed,\r\nhowever, that if one found a manuscript beside the chair of one of the\r\nladies of the house, it was sure to be on a religious subject, while\r\nthose which lay by the seats of the fathers of the family were full of\r\nthe loftiest strains of Latin eloquence. In making this distinction, I\r\ndo not forget that there are some writings of equal literary excellence\r\nin both branches, that Augustine may be paired off against Varro, and\r\nPrudentius against Horace. Among these books, the works of Origen, the\r\nAdamantine, were frequently perused by readers holding our faith. I\r\ncannot understand why some of our arch-divines should stigmatise him as\r\na dangerous and heterodox author.”[5]\r\n\r\nIn summing up the work of Sidonius, Hodgkin points out the noteworthy\r\nopportunities for making a literary reputation which were missed by\r\nhim. “He might have been the Herodotus of mediæval Europe. He could\r\nhave given authentic pictures of the laws and customs of the Goths,\r\nFranks, and Burgundians ... a full portraiture of the great apostle\r\nof the Germanic races, Ulfilas, and the secret causes of his and\r\ntheir devotion to the Arian form of Christianity; and he could have\r\nrecorded the Gothic equivalents of the mythological tales in the\r\nScandinavian Edda and the story of the old Runes and their relation to\r\nthe Mœso-Gothic alphabet. All these details and a hundred more, full\r\nof interest to science, to art, to literature, Sidonius might have\r\npreserved for us had his mind been as open as was that of Herodotus to\r\nthe manifold impressions made by picturesque and strange nationalities.”\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless fortunate for the literary reputation of Sidonius\r\nthat his father-in-law, Avitus, came to be emperor. The reign of\r\nAvitus was short, but he had time to give to his brilliant son-in-law\r\na position as Court poet or poet-laureate, while it was probably due\r\nto the imperial influence that the Senate decreed the erection (during\r\nthe lifetime of the poet) of the brass statue of Sidonius, which was\r\nplaced between the two libraries of Trajan. These libraries, containing\r\nthe one Greek and the other Latin authors, stood between the column of\r\nTrajan and the Basilica Ulpia. Sidonius describes his statue as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Cum meis poni statuam perennem_\r\n    _Nerva Trajanus titulis videret,_\r\n    _Inter auctores utriusque fixam Bibliothecæ._\r\n\r\n    (Sidonius, _Ex._, ix., 16.)\r\n\r\n    _Nil vatum prodest adjectum laudibus illud_\r\n    _Ulpia quod rutilat porticus ære meo._\r\n\r\n    (Sidonius, _Carm._, viii., 7, 8.)[6]\r\n\r\n(Since Nerva Trajanus decreed the erection of a permanent statue, which\r\nis inscribed with the records of my honours, and is placed between the\r\nauthors of the two libraries.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the entrance to the Ulpian Library is aglow with the\r\nbronze of my statue, can add nothing to the laurels of other poets.)\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Hodgkin, the books in these two collections in the\r\nBibliotheca Ulpia may very well have been of more importance to later\r\ngenerations than those of the library of Alexandria. The books from\r\nTrajan’s libraries were, according to Vopiscus, transported in all or\r\nin part to the Baths of Diocletian. Hodgkin understands that, between\r\n300 and 450, they were restored to their original home.[7]\r\n\r\nIn the year 537 A.D., the rule of the Goths in Italy, which had been\r\nestablished by Theodoric in 493, was practically brought to a close by\r\nthe victories of Belisarius, the general of the Eastern Empire, and,\r\nthirty years later, the destruction of the Gothic State was completed\r\nby the invasion of the Lombards. With the Lombards in possession of\r\nNorthern Italy, and the Vandals, in a series of campaigns against\r\nthe armies from Constantinople, overrunning the southern portions\r\nof the peninsula, the social organisation of the country must have\r\nbeen almost destroyed, and the civilisation which had survived from\r\nthe old Empire, while never entirely disappearing, was doubtless in\r\nlarge part submerged. A certain continuity of Roman rule and of Roman\r\nintellectual influence was, however, preserved through the growing\r\npower of the Church, which was already claiming the inheritance of the\r\nEmpire, and which, as early as 590, under the lead of Pope Gregory the\r\nGreat, succeeded in making good its claims to ecclesiastical supremacy\r\nthroughout the larger part of Europe. In its control of the consciences\r\nof rulers, the Church frequently, in fact, secured a domination that\r\nwas by no means limited to things spiritual.\r\n\r\nThe history of books in manuscript and of the production and\r\ndistribution of literature in Europe from the beginning of the work\r\nof S. Benedict to the time when the printing-press of Gutenberg\r\nrevolutionised the methods of book-making, a period covering about nine\r\ncenturies, may be divided into three stages. During the first, the\r\nresponsibility for the preservation of the old-time literature and for\r\nkeeping alive some continuity of intellectual life, rested solely with\r\nthe monasteries, and the work of multiplying and of distributing such\r\nbooks as had survived was carried on by the monks, and by them only.\r\nDuring the second stage, the older universities, the organisation of\r\nwhich had gradually been developed from schools (themselves chiefly of\r\nmonastic origin), became centres of intellectual activity and shared\r\nwith the monasteries the work of producing books. The books emanating\r\nfrom the university scribes were, however, for the most part restricted\r\nto a few special classes, classes which had, as a rule, not been\r\nproduced in the monasteries, and, as will be noted in a later chapter,\r\nthe university booksellers (_stationarii_ or _librarii_) were in the\r\nearlier periods not permitted to engage in any general distribution of\r\nbooks. With the third stage of manuscript literature, book-producing\r\nand bookselling machinery came into existence in the towns, and the\r\nknowledge of reading being no longer confined to the _cleric_ or the\r\n_magister_, books were prepared for the use of the larger circles of\r\nthe community, and to meet the requirements of such circles were, to an\r\nextent increasing with each generation, written in the tongue of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe first period begins with the foundation by S. Benedict, in 529, of\r\nthe monastery of Monte Cassino, and by Cassiodorus, in 531, of that of\r\nVivaria or Viviers, and continues until the last decade of the twelfth\r\ncentury, when we find the earliest record of an organised book-business\r\nin the universities of Bologna and Paris. The beginning of literary\r\nwork in the universities, to which I refer as indicating a second\r\nstage, did not, however, bring to an end, and, in fact, for a time\r\nhardly lessened, the production of books in the monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of book-production in Europe may be said to begin\r\nwith the first years of the fifteenth century, when the manuscript\r\ntrade of Venice and Florence became important, when the book-men\r\nor publishers of Paris, outside of the university, had developed a\r\nbusiness in the collecting, manifolding, and selling of manuscripts,\r\nand when manuscripts first find place in the schedules of the goods\r\nsold at the fairs of Frankfort and Nordlingen. The costliness of the\r\nskilled labour required for the production of manuscripts, and the many\r\nobstacles and difficulties in the way of their distribution, caused the\r\ndevelopment of the book-trade to proceed but slowly. It was the case,\r\nnevertheless, and particularly in Germany, that a very considerable\r\ndemand for literature of certain classes had been developed among the\r\npeople before the close of the manuscript period, a demand which was\r\nbeing met with texts produced in constantly increasing quantities and\r\nat steadily lessening cost. When the printing-press arrived it found,\r\ntherefore, already in existence a wide-spread literary interest and a\r\npopular demand for books, a demand which, with the immediate cheapening\r\nof books, was, of course, enormously increased. The production of\r\nbooks in manuscript came to a close, not with the invention of the\r\nprinting-press in 1450, but with the time when printing had become\r\ngenerally introduced, about twenty-five years later.\r\n\r\nIt was in the monasteries that were preserved such fragments of the\r\nclassic literature as had escaped the general devastation of Italy; and\r\nit was to the labours of the monks of the West, and particularly to\r\nthe labours of the monks of S. Benedict, that was due the preservation\r\nfor the Middle Ages and for succeeding generations of the remembrance\r\nand the influence of the literature of classic times. For a period of\r\nmore than six centuries, the safety of the literary heritage of Europe,\r\none may say of the world, depended upon the scribes of a few dozen\r\nscattered monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe Order of S. Benedict was instituted in 529, and the monastery of\r\nMonte Cassino, near Naples, founded by him in the same year, exercised\r\nfor centuries an influence of distinctive importance upon the literary\r\ninterests of the Church, of Italy, and of the world. This monastery\r\n(which still exists) is not far from Subiaco, the spot chosen by S.\r\nBenedict for his first retreat. It was in the monastery of Subiaco\r\n(founded many years afterwards) that was done, nearly a thousand\r\nyears later, the first printing in Italy. The Rule of S. Benedict,\r\ncomprising the regulations for the government of his Order, contained\r\na specific instruction that a certain number of hours in each day were\r\nto be devoted to labour in the _scriptorium_. The monks who were not\r\nyet competent to work as scribes were to be instructed by the others.\r\nScribe work was to be accepted in place of an equal number of hours\r\ngiven to manual labour out-of-doors, while the skilled scribes, whose\r\nwork was of special importance as instructors or in the _scriptorium_,\r\nwere to be freed from a certain portion of their devotional exercises\r\nor observances. The monasteries of the Benedictines were for centuries\r\nmore numerous, more wealthy, and more influential than those of any\r\nother Order, and this provision of a Rule which directed the actions,\r\ncontrolled the daily lives, and inspired the purposes of thousands\r\nof earnest workers among the monks of successive generations, must\r\nhave exercised a most noteworthy influence on the history of literary\r\nproduction in Europe. It is not too much to say that it was S. Benedict\r\nwho provided the “copy” which a thousand years later was to supply the\r\npresses of Gutenberg, Aldus, Froben, and Stephanus.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find in the narratives of the life of S.\r\nBenedict any record showing the origin of his interest in literature,\r\nan interest which was certainly exceptional for an ecclesiastic of\r\nthe sixth century. It seems very probable, however, that Benedict’s\r\nassociation with Cassiodorus had not a little to do with the\r\nliterary impetus given to the work of the Benedictines. Cassiodorus,\r\nwho, as Chancellor of King Theodoric, had taken an active part in\r\nthe government of the Gothic kingdom, passed the last thirty years\r\nof his life first as a monk and later as abbot in the monastery of\r\nVivaria, or Viviers, in Calabria, which he had himself founded in\r\n531. Cassiodorus is generally classed by the Church chronicles as a\r\nBenedictine, and his monastery is referred to by Montalembert as the\r\nsecond of the Benedictine foundations. Hodgkin points out, however,\r\nthat the Rule adopted by the monks of Viviers, or prescribed for them\r\nby its founder, was not that of S. Benedict, but was drawn from the\r\nwritings of Cassian, the founder of western monachism, who had died a\r\ncentury before.[8] The two Rules were, however, fully in accord with\r\neach other in spirit, while for the idea of using the convent as a\r\nplace of literary toil and theological training, Benedict was indebted\r\nto Cassiodorus. “At a very early date in the history of their Order,”\r\nsays Hodgkin, “the Benedictines, influenced probably by the example of\r\nthe monastery of Vivaria, commenced that long series of services to the\r\ncause of literature which they have never wholly intermitted. Instead\r\nof accepting the ... formula from which some scholars have contended\r\nthat Cassiodorus was a Benedictine, we should perhaps be rather\r\njustified in maintaining that Benedict, or at least his immediate\r\nfollowers, were Cassiodorians.”[9]\r\n\r\nIt was the fortune of Cassiodorus to serve as a connecting link between\r\nthe world of classic Rome and that of the Middle Ages. He saw the\r\ndirection and control of the community pass from the monarchs and\r\nthe leaders of armies to the Church and to the monasteries, and he\r\nwas himself an active agent in helping to bring about such transfer.\r\nBorn in 479, only three years after the overthrow of the last of\r\nthe Emperors of the West, he grew up under the rule of Odovacar,\r\nthe Herulian. While still a youth, he had seen the Herulian kingdom\r\ndestroyed by Theodoric, and he had lived to mourn over the ruins of\r\nthe realm founded by the Goth, which he had himself helped to govern.\r\nHe saw his beloved Italy taken possession of by the armies of Narses\r\nand Belisarius from the east, and a little later overrun by the\r\nundisciplined hordes of the Lombards from the north. The first great\r\nschism between the Eastern and the Western Churches began during his\r\nboyhood and terminated before, as Abbot of Vivaria, it became necessary\r\nfor him to take a decided part on the one side or the other. A Greek by\r\nancestry, a Roman by training, the experience of Cassiodorus included\r\nwork and achievements as statesman, orator, scholar, author, and\r\necclesiastic. He had witnessed the extinction of the Roman Senate,\r\nof which both his father and himself had been members; the practical\r\nabolition of the Consulate, an honour to which he had also attained;\r\nand the close of the schools of philosophy in Athens, with the\r\ndoctrines of which he, almost alone in his generation of Italians, was\r\nfamiliar. He had done much to maintain in the Court and throughout\r\nthe kingdom of Theodoric, such standard of scholarly interests and\r\nof literary appreciation as was practicable with the resources\r\navailable; and, in like manner, he brought with him to his monastery\r\na scholarly enthusiasm for classic literature, of which literature he\r\nmay not unnaturally have felt himself to be almost the sole surviving\r\nrepresentative. It is difficult to over-estimate the extent of the\r\nservice rendered by Cassiodorus to literature and to later generations\r\nin initiating the training of monks as scribes, and in putting into\r\ntheir hands for their first work in the _scriptorium_ the masterpieces\r\nof classic literature. He belonged both to the world of ancient Rome,\r\nwhich he had outlived, and to that of the Middle Ages, the thought and\r\nwork of which he helped to shape. With the close of the official career\r\nof Cassiodorus as Secretary of State for the Gothic kingdom of Italy,\r\nthe history of ancient Europe may, for the purpose of my narrative,\r\nbe considered to end. With the consecration of Cassiodorus, as Abbot\r\nof the monastery of Vivaria, (which took place about 550, when he was\r\nseventy years of age), and the instituting by him of the first European\r\n_scriptorium_, I may begin the record of the production of books during\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF BOOKS IN THE MONASTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE used for the heading of the chapter the term “the making of\r\nbooks” rather than “literary work,” because the service rendered by\r\nthe earlier monastic scribes (a service of essential importance for\r\nthe intellectual life of the world) consisted chiefly, as has been\r\nindicated, not in the production of original literature, but in the\r\nreproduction and preservation of the literature that had been inherited\r\nfrom earlier writers,--writers whose works had been accepted as\r\nclassics. While it was the case that in this literary labour it was the\r\nBenedictines who for centuries rendered the most important service, the\r\nfirst of the European monasteries in which such labour was carried on\r\nas a part of the prescribed routine or rule of the monastic life was\r\nthat of Vivaria or Viviers, founded by Cassiodorus, which was never\r\nformally associated with the Benedictine Order, and which had, in\r\nfact, adopted, in place of the Benedictine Rule, a rule founded on the\r\nteachings of Cassian, who had died early in the fifth century. The work\r\ndone, under the instructions of Cassiodorus, by the scribes of Viviers,\r\nserved as an incentive and an example for Monte Cassino, the monastery\r\nfounded by S. Benedict, while the _scriptorium_ instituted in Monte\r\nCassino was accepted as a model by the long series of later Benedictine\r\nmonasteries which during the succeeding seven centuries became centres\r\nof literary activity.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the Gothic kingdom of Italy, it was with\r\nthese monasteries that rested the intellectual future of Europe.\r\nMankind was, for the time at least, to be directed and influenced,\r\nnot so much by royal chancellors or prætorian guards, as by the monks\r\npreaching from their cells and by the monastic scribes distributing the\r\nworld’s literature from the _scriptorium_.\r\n\r\n=Cassiodorus and S. Benedict.=--In the literary history of Europe, the\r\npart played by Cassiodorus was so important and the service rendered\r\nby him was so distinctive, that it seems pertinent for the purposes\r\nof this story to present in some detail the record of his life and\r\nwork. As is indicated by the name by which he is known in history,\r\nCassiodorus was of Greek lineage, his family belonging to the Greek\r\ncity of Scyllacium in Southern Italy. His full name was Magnus Aurelius\r\nCassiodorus Senator. His ancestors had, for several generations,\r\nheld under the successive rulers of Italy positions of trust and\r\nhonour, and the family ranked with the patricians. The father of the\r\nauthor and abbot, usually referred to as Cassiodorus the third, was\r\nfinance minister under Odovacar, and when the Herulian King had been\r\novercome and slain by Theodoric, the minister was skilful enough to\r\nmake himself necessary to the Gothic conqueror, from whom he received\r\nvarious important posts, and by whom he was finally appointed Prætorian\r\nPrefect. The Cassiodorus with whom this study is concerned, known as\r\nCassiodorus the fourth, was born about 479, or three years after the\r\nGothic conquest.[10] He began his official career as early as twenty,\r\nand it was while holding, at this age, the position of Consilarius,\r\nthat he brought himself to the favourable attention of Theodoric by\r\nmeans of an eloquent panegyric spoken in praise of that monarch.\r\n\r\nTheodoric appointed him Quæstor, an office which made him the\r\nmouth-piece of the sovereign. To the Quæstor belonged the duty of\r\nconducting the official correspondence of the Court, of receiving\r\nambassadors, and of replying in fitting harangues to their addresses,\r\nso that he was at once foreign secretary and Court orator. He also had\r\nthe responsibility of giving a final revision to all the laws which\r\nreceived the signature of the King, and of seeing that these were\r\nproperly worded and did not conflict with previous enactments.[11]\r\nTheodoric, who had received what little education he possessed from\r\nGreek instructors in Constantinople, was said never to have mastered\r\nLatin, and he doubtless found the services of his eloquent and\r\nscholarly minister very convenient.\r\n\r\nIt was the contention of Theodoric that his kingdom represented the\r\nnatural continuation of the Roman Empire, and that he was himself\r\nthe legitimate successor of the emperors. He took as his official\r\ndesignation not _Rex Italiæ_, but _Gothorum et Romanorum Rex_. This\r\ncontention was fully upheld by the Quæstor, who felt himself to be the\r\nrepresentative at once of the official authority of the new kingdom and\r\nof the literary prestige of the old Empire, and who did what was in\r\nhis power to preserve in Ravenna the classical traditions of old Rome\r\nand to make the Court the centre of literary influence and activity.\r\nTheodoric and his Goths had accepted the creed of the Arians, but the\r\ninfluence of his minister, who was a Christian of the Athanasian or\r\nTrinitarian faith, was sufficient to preserve a spirit of toleration\r\nthroughout the kingdom. It is to Cassiodorus that is due what was\r\nprobably the first official utterance of toleration that Europe had\r\nknown, an utterance that in later European history was to be so largely\r\nset at nought: _Religionem imperare non possumus, quia nemo cogitur\r\nut credat invitus_.[12] [We must not enforce (acceptance of) a creed,\r\nsince no one can think or can believe against his will.] It is not\r\none of the least of the services of Cassiodorus that he should at\r\nthis early date, when the bitterness of controversy was active in\r\nthe Church, have been able to set a standard of wise and Christian\r\ntoleration. His action had a good effect later in his own monastery\r\nand in the monasteries whose work was modelled on that of Viviers. It\r\nwas only in monastic centres like Viviers and Monte Cassino, where\r\nChristian influence and educational work were held to be of more\r\nimportance than theological issues, that literary activity became\r\npossible, and it was only in such monasteries that labour was expended\r\nin preserving the writings of “pagan” (that is, of classic) authors.\r\n\r\nIn 514, Cassiodorus became Consul, a title which, while no longer\r\nstanding for any authority, was still held to be one of the highest\r\nhonours, and in 515 he received the title of patrician. In 519, he\r\npublished, under the title of _Chronicon_, an abstract of history from\r\nthe deluge to the year 519. Hodgkin points out that in his record\r\nof events of the fifth century, a very large measure of favourable,\r\nor rather of partial attention is given to the annals of the Goths.\r\nShortly after the publication of the _Chronicon_, Cassiodorus began\r\nwork on his _History of the Goths_, which was finally completed in\r\ntwelve books, and the chief purpose of which was to vindicate the\r\nclaims of the Goths to rank among the historic nations of antiquity,\r\nby bringing them into connection with Greece and Rome, and by making\r\nthe origin of Gothic history Roman. This history of Cassiodorus\r\nis known only by tradition, not a single copy of it having been\r\npreserved. The system of scribe-work in the monasteries, to which we\r\nowe nearly all of the old-world literature that has come down to us,\r\ndid not prove adequate to preserve the greatest work of its founder. A\r\ntreatise on the origin of the Goths by a later writer named Jordæus,\r\nconcerning whom little is known, is avowedly based upon the history of\r\nCassiodorus, and is the principal source of information concerning the\r\ncharacter of this history.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the death of Theodoric, Cassiodorus was holding the\r\nimportant place of Master of the Offices, a post which combined many\r\nof the duties that would to-day be discharged by a Home Secretary,\r\na Secretary of War, and a Postmaster-General. Under the regency of\r\nQueen Amalasuentha, Cassiodorus received his final official honour in\r\nhis appointment as Prætorian Prefect. In the collection of letters\r\npublished under the title of _Variæ_, Cassiodorus gives accounts of\r\nthe work done by him in these various official stations, and these\r\nletters present vivid and interesting pictures of the methods of the\r\nadministration of the kingdom, and also throw light upon many of its\r\nrelations with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus continued to do service as minister for the successors\r\nof Amalasuentha, Athalaric, Theodadad, and Witigis, and retired from\r\nofficial responsibility only a few months before the capture of Ravenna\r\nby Belisarius, in 540, brought the Ostrogothic monarchy to an end. At\r\nthe time of the entry of the Greek army, Cassiodorus, now a veteran of\r\nsixty years, was in retirement in his monastery in Bruttii (the modern\r\nCalabria). It was doubtless because of the absence of Cassiodorus\r\nfrom the capital, that no mention is made of him in the narrative of\r\nthe campaign written by Procopius the historian, who, as secretary\r\nto Belisarius, entered Rome with the latter after the victories over\r\nWitigis.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus must have possessed very exceptional adaptability of\r\ncharacter, not to say elasticity of conscience, to be able, during\r\na period extending over nearly half a century, to retain the favour\r\nof so many of the successive rulers of Italy and apparently to make\r\nhis services necessary to each one of them. It is certain, however,\r\nthat Italy benefited largely by the fact that through the various\r\ncontests and changes of monarchs, it had been possible to preserve a\r\ncertain continuity of executive policy and of administrative methods.\r\nThe further fact that the “perpetual” or at least the continuing\r\nminister was at once a Greek and a Roman, and not only a statesman but\r\na scholar, and that he had succeeded in preserving through all the\r\ndevastations of civil wars and of foreign invasions a great collection\r\nof classic books and a persistent (even though restricted) interest in\r\nclassic literature, exercised an enormous influence upon the culture\r\nof Europe for centuries to come. The career of Cassiodorus had, as we\r\nhave seen, been varied and honourable. It was, however, his exceptional\r\nfortune to be able to render the most important and the most\r\ndistinctive service of his life after his life’s work had apparently\r\nbeen completed.\r\n\r\nShortly after his withdrawal to Bruttii, and when, as said, he was\r\nalready more than sixty years old, he retired to his monastery,\r\nVivaria, and during the thirty-six years of activity that remained for\r\nhim, he not only completed a number of important literary productions\r\nof his own, but he organised the literary work of the monastery\r\n_scriptorium_, which served as a model for that of Monte Cassino, and,\r\nthrough Monte Cassino, for the long series of Benedictine monasteries\r\nthat came into existence throughout Europe. It was the hand of\r\nCassiodorus which gave the literary impetus to the Benedictine Order,\r\nand it was from his magnificent collection of manuscripts, rescued from\r\nthe ruins of the libraries of Italy, that was supplied material for the\r\npens of thousands of monastic scribes.\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement to Bruttii, Cassiodorus founded a second\r\nmonastery, known as Mons Castellius, the work of which was planned\r\nfor a more austere class of hermits than those who had associated\r\nthemselves together at Vivaria. Of both monasteries he retained the\r\npractical control, and, according to Trithemius (whose opinion is\r\naccepted by Montalembert) of Vivaria he became abbot.[13] Hodgkin,\r\nwhile himself citing the extract from Trithemius, thinks it possible\r\nthat Cassiodorus never formally became abbot, but says that the\r\ndirection and supervision of the work of the two monasteries rested in\r\nany case in his hands.[14]\r\n\r\nHis treatise on the Nature of the Soul (_De Anima_) was probably\r\ncompleted just before he began his monastic life, and was itself an\r\nevidence of the change in the direction of his thoughts and of his\r\nideals. Cassiodorus had now done with politics. As Hodgkin points out,\r\nthe dream of his life had been to build up an independent Italian\r\nState, strong with the strength of the Goths, and wise with the wisdom\r\nof the Romans. It is evident that he also felt himself charged with\r\na special responsibility in preserving for later generations the\r\nliterature and the learning of the classic world. With the destruction\r\nof the Gothic kingdom, that dream had been scattered to the winds. The\r\nonly institutions which retained a continuity of organisation were\r\nthose belonging to the Church, and it was through the Church that must\r\nbe preserved for later generations the thought and the scholarship\r\nof antiquity. It was with a full understanding of this change in the\r\nnature of his responsibilities, that Cassiodorus decided to consecrate\r\nhis old age to religious labours and to a work even more important than\r\nany of his political achievements: the preservation, by the pens of\r\nmonastic copyists, of the Christian Scriptures, of the writings of the\r\nearly Fathers, and of the great works of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nSome years before his retirement from Ravenna, Cassiodorus had\r\nendeavoured to induce Pope Agapetus (535-536) to found a school of\r\ntheology and Christian literature at Rome, modelled on the plan of the\r\nschools of Alexandria and Nisibis. The confusion consequent on the\r\ninvasion of Italy by Belisarius had prevented the fulfilment of this\r\nscheme. The aged statesman was now, however, planning to accomplish, by\r\nmeans of his two monasteries, a similar educational work.\r\n\r\nHodgkin summarises the aims of earlier monasticism, (aims which were\r\nmost fully carried out in the monasteries of the East and of Africa,)\r\nas follows: In the earlier days of monasticism, men like the hermits\r\nof the Thebaïd had thought of little else but mortifying the flesh\r\nby vigils and fastings, and withdrew from all human voices in order\r\nto enjoy an ecstatic communion with their Maker. The life in common\r\nof monks like those of Nitria and Lerinum had chastened some of the\r\nextravagances of these lonely enthusiasts, while still keeping in\r\nview their main purpose. S. Jerome, in his cell at Bethlehem, had\r\nshown what great results might be obtained for the Church of all ages\r\nfrom the patient literary toil of one religious recluse. And finally,\r\nS. Benedict, in that Rule of his, which was for centuries to be the\r\ncode of monastic Christendom, had sanctified work as one of the most\r\neffectual preservatives of the bodily and spiritual health of the\r\nascetic.\r\n\r\n“It was the glory of Cassiodorus,” says Hodgkin,[15] “that he first\r\nand pre-eminently insisted on the expediency of including intellectual\r\nlabour in the sphere of monastic duties.... This thought [may we not\r\nsay this divinely suggested thought?] in the mind of Cassiodorus was\r\none of infinite importance to the human race. Here, on the one hand,\r\nwere the vast armies of monks, whom both the unsettled state of the\r\ntimes and the religious ideas of the age were driving irresistibly\r\ninto the cloister; and who, when immured there with only theology\r\nto occupy their minds, became, as the great cities of the East knew\r\nonly too well, preachers of discord and mad fanaticism. Here, on\r\nthe other hand, were the accumulated stores of two thousand years\r\nof literature, sacred and profane, the writings of Hebrew prophets,\r\nGreek philosophers, Latin rhetoricians, perishing for want of men\r\nwith leisure to transcribe them. The luxurious Roman noble with his\r\nslave amanuenses multiplying copies of his favourite authors for his\r\nown and his friends’ libraries, was an almost extinct existence. With\r\nevery movement of barbarian troops over Italy, whether those barbarians\r\ncalled themselves the men of Witigis or of Justinian, some towns were\r\nbeing sacked, some precious manuscripts were perishing from the world.\r\nCassiodorus perceived that the boundless, the often wearisome leisure\r\nof the convent might be profitably spent in arresting this work of\r\ndenudation, in preserving for future ages the intellectual treasure\r\nwhich must otherwise inevitably have perished. That this was one of the\r\ngreat services rendered by the monasteries to the human race, the most\r\nsuperficial student has learned, but not all who have learned it know\r\nthat the monks’ first decided impulse in this direction was derived\r\nfrom Cassiodorus.”\r\n\r\nThe German biographer of Cassiodorus, Franz, uses similar language:\r\n\r\n_Das Verdienst, zuerst die Pflege der Wissenschaften in den Bereich der\r\nAufgaben des Klosterlichen Lebens aufgenommen zu haben, kann man mit\r\nvollem Rechte für Cassiodorus in Anspruch nehmen._[16]\r\n\r\nIn the account given by Cassiodorus of the _scriptorium_ of his\r\nmonastery, he describes, with an enthusiasm which ought to have been\r\ncontagious, the noble work done there by the _antiquarius_[17]: “He\r\nmay fill his mind with the Scriptures while copying the sayings of\r\nthe Lord; with his fingers he gives life to men and arms against the\r\nwiles of the devil. As the _antiquarius_ copies the words of Christ,\r\nso many wounds does he inflict upon Satan. What he writes in his cell\r\nwill be scattered far and wide over distant provinces. Man multiplies\r\nthe words of Heaven, and, if I may dare so to speak, the three fingers\r\nof his right hand are made to express the utterances of the Holy\r\nTrinity. The fast travelling reed writes down the holy words and thus\r\navenges the malice of the Wicked One, who caused a reed to be used to\r\nsmite the head of the Saviour.” The passage here quoted refers only to\r\nthe work of the copyists of the Christian Scriptures. There are other\r\nreferences, however, in the same work to indicate that the activity of\r\nthe _scriptorium_ was not confined to these, but was also employed on\r\nsecular literature.[18]\r\n\r\nThe devotion and application of the monks produced in the course\r\nof years a class of scribes whose work in the transcribing and\r\nilluminating of manuscripts far surpassed in perfection and beauty the\r\nproductions of the copyists of classic Rome. In the monasteries north\r\nof the Alps the work of the scribes was, for the earlier centuries,\r\ndevoted principally to the production of copies of missals and other\r\nbooks of devotion and of portions of the Scriptures. In Italy, however,\r\nwhere classical culture never entirely disappeared, attention continued\r\nto be given to the transcription of the Latin texts of which any\r\nmanuscripts had been preserved, and it was these transcripts of the\r\nmonks of Cassiodorus and S. Benedict that gave the “copy” for the first\r\neditions of Cicero, Virgil, and the other classic writers, produced by\r\nthe earliest printers of Germany and Italy.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus took pains to emphasise the importance of binding the\r\nsacred codices in covers worthy of the beauty of their contents,\r\nfollowing the example of the householder in the parable, who provided\r\nwedding garments for all who came to the supper of his son. One\r\npattern volume had been prepared containing samples of various sorts\r\nof covers, from which the scribe might choose that which pleased\r\nhim best. The abbot had also provided, to help the nightly toil of\r\nthe _scriptorium_, mechanical lamps of some ingenious construction\r\nwhich appears to have made them self-trimming and to have insured a\r\ncontinuously sufficient supply of oil. The labour of the scribes was\r\nregulated on bright days by sun-dials, and on cloudy days and during\r\nthe hours of the night by water-clocks.\r\n\r\nIn order to set an example of literary diligence to his monks, and to\r\nbe able to sympathise with the difficulties of scribe work, Cassiodorus\r\nhimself transcribed (probably from the translation of Jerome) the\r\nPsalter, the Prophets, and the Epistles. In addition to his labours as\r\na transcriber, Cassiodorus did a large amount of work as an original\r\nauthor and as a compiler. According to the judgment of Migne, Franz,\r\nand Hodgkin, the importance of his original writings varied very\r\nconsiderably, and is by no means to be estimated in proportion to their\r\nbulk. One of the most considerable of these was his great commentary on\r\nthe Psalms, in the text of which he was able to discover refutations\r\nof all the heresies that had thus far racked the Church, together with\r\nthe rudiments of all the sciences which had become known to the world.\r\nThis was followed by a commentary on the Epistles and by a history of\r\nthe Church, the latter having been undertaken in co-operation with his\r\nfriend Epiphanius. This history, known as the _Historia Tripartita_, is\r\nsaid to have had a larger circulation than any other of the author’s\r\nworks. A fourth work, which gives more of the personality of the\r\nwriter, was an educational treatise entitled, _Institutiones Divinarum\r\net Humanarum Lectionum_. In the first part of this treatise, which\r\nbore the title of _De Institutione Divinarum Litterarum_, the author\r\ngives an account of the organisation of his _scriptorium_. In the\r\nsecond division of the treatise, entitled _De Artibus ac Disciplinis\r\nLiberalium Litterarum_, the author states his view of the relative\r\nimportance of the four liberal arts, Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic,\r\nand Mathematics, the last named of which he divides into the four\r\n“disciplines” of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. Geometry\r\nand Astronomy occupy together one page, Arithmetic and Music each\r\ntwo pages, Grammar two pages, Rhetoric six pages, while to Logic are\r\ndevoted eighteen pages. The final production of his industrious life\r\nwas a treatise called _De Orthographia_, which was completed when its\r\nauthor was ninety-three years old, and which was planned expressly to\r\nfurther the work of the monastic scribes in collecting and correcting\r\nthe codices of ancient books.\r\n\r\nThe death of Cassiodorus occurred in 575, in the ninety-sixth year of\r\nhis age. An inheritor of the traditions of imperial Rome, Cassiodorus\r\nhad been able, in a career extending over nearly a century, to be\r\nof signal service to his country under a series of foreign rulers.\r\nHe had succeeded, through his personal influence with these rulers,\r\nin maintaining for Italy an organisation based on Roman precedents,\r\nand in preserving for the society of the capital an interest in the\r\npreservation and cultivation of classic literature. When the political\r\ninstitutions of Italy had been shattered and the very existence of\r\ncivilisation was imperilled, he had transferred his services to the\r\nChurch, recognising, with the adaptability which was the special\r\ncharacteristic of the man, that with the Church now rested the hopes\r\nof any continuity of organised society, of intellectual interest,\r\nof civilisation itself. He brought to the Church the advantage of\r\nexceptional executive ability and of long official experience, and he\r\nalso brought a large measure of scholarship and an earnest zeal for\r\nliterary and educational interests. It is not too much to say that the\r\ncontinuity of the thought and civilisation of the ancient world with\r\nthat of the Middle Ages was due, more than to any other one man, to the\r\nlife and labours of Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\n=S. Benedict.=--The _Life of S. Benedict_, written by Pope Gregory I.\r\n(who was born in 543, the year of the death of the saint), was for\r\ncenturies one of the most popular books circulated in Europe. The\r\nfull title is: _Vita et Miracula Venerabilis Benedicti conditoris,\r\nvel Abbatis Monasterii; quod appellatur arcis Provinciæ Campaniæ_.\r\n“The Life and Miracles of the Venerable Benedict, Founder and Abbot\r\nof the Monastery which is called (of) the Citadel of the Province of\r\nCampania.” This biography was, later, translated by Pope Zacharias from\r\nthe original Latin into Greek.\r\n\r\nThe great achievement of Benedict was the one literary product of his\r\nlife, the _Regula_. It comprises seventy-three short chapters, probably\r\nnot designed by the author for use beyond the bounds of the communities\r\nunder his own immediate supervision. It proved to be the thing for\r\nwhich the world of religious and thoughtful men was then longing, a\r\ncomplete code of monastic duty. By a strange parallelism, almost in\r\nthe very year in which the great Emperor Justinian was codifying the\r\nresults of seven centuries of Roman secular legislation for the benefit\r\nof the judges and the statesmen of the new Europe, Benedict, on his\r\nlonely mountain top, was composing his code for the regulation of the\r\ndaily life of the great civilisers of Europe for seven centuries to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n_The Rule of S. Benedict, Chap. 48. Concerning Daily Manual\r\nLabour._--“Idleness is the enemy of the soul: hence brethren ought at\r\ncertain seasons to occupy themselves with manual labour, and again\r\nat certain hours with holy reading. Between Easter and the calends\r\nof October let them apply themselves to reading from the fourth hour\r\nuntil the sixth hour.... From the calends of October to the beginning\r\nof Lent, let them apply themselves to reading until the second hour.\r\nDuring Lent, let them apply themselves to reading from morning until\r\nthe end of the third hour, and in these days of Lent, let them receive\r\na book apiece from the library and read it straight through. These\r\nbooks are to be given out at the beginning of Lent.”[19]\r\n\r\nThis simple regulation, uttered by one the power and extent of whose\r\nfar-reaching influence have rarely been equalled among men, gave an\r\nimpulse to study that grew with the growth of the Order, and that\r\nsecured a continuity of intellectual light and life through the dark\r\nages, the results of which have endured to modern times. “Wherever a\r\nBenedictine house arose, or a monastery of any one of the Orders, which\r\nwere but offshoots from the Benedictine tree, books were multiplied and\r\na library came into existence, small indeed at first, but increasing\r\nyear by year, till the wealthier houses had gathered together\r\ncollections of books that would do credit to a modern university.”[20]\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, the case that the injunction to read, an injunction\r\ngiven at a time when books were very few and monks were becoming many,\r\ncarried with it an instruction for writing until copies of the books\r\nprescribed should have been produced in sufficient numbers to meet\r\nthe requirements of the readers. The _armaria_ could be filled only\r\nthrough steady and persistent work in the _scriptoria_, and, as we\r\nshall see later, such scribe-work was accepted not only as a part of\r\nthe “manual labour” prescribed in the Rule, but not infrequently (in\r\nthe case of the skilled scribes) in lieu of some portion of the routine\r\nof religious observance. Benedict would not have his monks limit\r\nthemselves to spiritual labour, to the action of the soul upon itself.\r\nHe made external labour, manual or literary, a strict obligation\r\nof his Rule. The routine of the monastic day was to include seven\r\nhours for manual labour, two hours for reading.[21] In later years,\r\nthe Benedictine monasteries became centres of instruction, supplying\r\nthe place, as far as was practicable, of the educational system of\r\nthe departed empire. As Order after Order was founded, there came to\r\nbe a steady development of interest in books and an ever increasing\r\ncare for their safe-keeping. S. Benedict had contented himself with\r\ngeneral directions for study; the Cluniacs prescribed the selection of\r\na special officer to take charge of the books, with an annual audit of\r\nthem and the assignment to each brother of a single volume.\r\n\r\n“The followers of the Saint continued in their patient labour, praying,\r\ndigging, and transcribing. The _scriptoria_ of the Benedictine\r\nmonastery will multiply copies not only of missals and theological\r\ntreatises, but of the poems and histories of antiquity. Whatever may\r\nhave been the religious value or the religious dangers of the monastic\r\nlife, the historian at least is bound to express his gratitude to these\r\nmen, without whose life-long toil the great deeds and thoughts of\r\nGreece and Rome might have been as completely lost to us as the wars\r\nof the buried Lake-dwellers or the thoughts of the Palæolithic man. To\r\ntake an illustration from S. Benedict’s own beloved Subiaco, the work\r\nof his disciples has been like one of the great aqueducts of the valley\r\nof the Arno--sometimes carried underground for centuries through the\r\nobscurity of unremembered existence, sometimes emerging to the daylight\r\nand borne high upon the arcade of noble lives, but equally through all\r\nits course, bearing the precious stream of ancient thought from the\r\nfar off hills of time into the humming and crowded cities of modern\r\ncivilisation.”[22]\r\n\r\n=The Earlier Monkish Scribes.=--The literary work begun under the\r\ndirection of Cassiodorus in the _scriptorium_ of Viviers, and enjoined\r\nby S. Benedict upon his monks at Monte Cassino, was, as said, carried\r\non by successive generations of monastic scribes during a number of\r\ncenturies. In fact, until the organisation of the older universities,\r\nin the latter part of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the production and the reproduction of literature was\r\npractically confined to the monasteries. “The monasteries,” says\r\nMaitland, in his erudite and vivacious work, _The Dark Ages_, “were,\r\nin those days of misrule and turbulence, beyond all price not only as\r\nplaces where (it may be imperfectly, but better than elsewhere) God\r\nwas worshipped, ... but as central points whence agriculture was to\r\nspread over bleak hills and barren downs and marshy plains, and deal\r\nits bread to millions perishing with hunger and its pestilential train;\r\nas repositories of the learning which then was, and as well-springs\r\nfor the learning which was to be; as nurseries of art and science,\r\ngiving to invention the stimulus, the means, and the reward; and\r\nattracting to themselves every head that could devise and every hand\r\nthat could execute; as the nucleus of the city which in after days of\r\npride should crown its palaces and bulwarks with the towering cross\r\nof its cathedral.”[23] It was fortunate for the literary future of\r\nEurope that the Benedictine Order, which had charged itself with\r\nliterary responsibilities, should have secured almost from the outset\r\nso considerable a development and should for centuries have remained\r\nthe greatest and most influential of all the monastic orders. At the\r\nbeginning of the ninth century, Charlemagne ordered an inquiry to\r\nbe made (as into a matter requiring careful research) as to whether\r\nthere were any monks who professed any other rule than the Rule of S.\r\nBenedict; from which it would appear that such monks were considered as\r\nrare and noteworthy exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhile the two monasteries of Cassiodorus in Calabria and the\r\nBenedictine foundation of Monte Cassino near Naples, were entitled to\r\nfirst reference on the ground of the exceptional influence exercised by\r\nthem upon the literary development of the monks, they were by no means\r\nthe earliest of the western monastic foundations. This honour belongs,\r\naccording to Denk,[24] to the monastery of Ligugé, near Poitiers\r\n(Monasterium Locociagense), founded in 360 A.D. by Bishop Martin of\r\nTours. The second in point of date, that of Marmoutier, near Tours, was\r\ninstituted by the same bishop a year or two later. Gaul proved to be\r\nfavourable ground for the spread of monastic tenets and influence, and\r\nby the year 400 its foundations included over two thousand monks.\r\n\r\nIn 405, S. Honoratus, later Bishop of Arles, founded a monastery on\r\nthe island of Lerin, on the south coast of France, which became a most\r\nimportant centre of learning and the mother of many monasteries.[25] In\r\nthe educational work carried on at Lerin, full consideration was given\r\nto classic authors, such as Cicero, Virgil, and Xenophon, as well as to\r\nthe writings of the Fathers, and the scribes were kept busied in the\r\nproduction of copies.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a certain amount of literary activity also in\r\nthe monasteries of the East and of Africa some time before any of the\r\nmonastic foundations in Europe had come into existence. The numerous\r\nwritings of the Fathers secured a wide circulation among the faithful,\r\na circulation which could have been possible only through the existence\r\nof efficient staffs of skilled scribes and in connection with some\r\nsystem of distribution between widely separated churches. Teachers like\r\nOrigen in Cæsarea, in the third century, and S. Jerome in Bethlehem and\r\nS. Augustine in Hippo, in the fifth century, put forth long series of\r\nwritings, religious, philosophical, and polemical, with apparently an\r\nassured confidence that these would reach wide circles of contemporary\r\nreaders, and that they would be preserved also for generations to\r\ncome. The sacking of Rome by Alaric (in 410) is used by S. Augustine\r\nas a text or occasion for the publication of his beautiful conception\r\nof “The City of God” in much the same manner as a preacher of later\r\ntimes might have based a homily on the burning of Moscow or the fall\r\nof Paris. The preacher of Hippo speaks as if he were addressing, not\r\nthe small circle of his African diocese, but mankind at large. And he\r\nwas, of course, justified in his faith, for the _De Civitate Dei_ was\r\nthe book which, next to the Scriptures, was most surely to be found in\r\nevery monastery in Europe, while when the work of the _scriptorium_ was\r\nreplaced by the printing-press, it became one of the most frequently\r\nprinted books in Europe. It appears from a reference by S. Augustine,\r\nthat nuns as well as monks were included among the African scribes.\r\nIn speaking of a nun named Melania, who, early in the fifth century,\r\nfounded a convent at Tagaste, near Carthage, he says that she had\r\n“gained her living by transcribing manuscripts,” and mentions that she\r\nwrote swiftly, beautifully, and correctly,--_scribebat et celeriter et\r\npulchre, citra errorem_.[26]\r\n\r\nThe scribe-work in the monasteries of Africa and of the East was,\r\ntherefore, sufficiently effective to preserve large portions of the\r\nwritings of the Fathers and of other early Christian teachers, and it\r\nis, in fact, to the libraries of these Eastern monasteries that is\r\nchiefly due the preservation of the long series of Greek texts which\r\nfound their way into Europe after the Renaissance. I have, however,\r\nbeen able to find no record of the system pursued in the _scriptoria_\r\nand _armaria_ of the Greek monasteries, and the narrative in the\r\npresent chapter is, therefore, confined to a sketch of the literary\r\nundertakings of the monks of the West.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known example of the work of a European monk dates from\r\nthe year 517. The manuscript is in the Capitular library in Verona, and\r\nhas been reproduced in fac-simile by Ottley. The script is that known\r\nas half uncial.[27] At the time this manuscript was being written,\r\nTheodoric the Goth was ruling in Italy, with Cassiodorus as his\r\nminister, and the monastery at Viviers was still to be founded.\r\n\r\nS. Gregory the Great, who became Pope in 590, exercised an important\r\ninfluence over the intellectual interests of his age. Gregory had been\r\ncharged with having destroyed the ancient monuments of Rome, with\r\nhaving burned the Palatine library, including the writings of Cicero\r\nand Livy, with having expelled the mathematicians from Rome, and with\r\nhaving reprimanded Bishop Didier of Vienna (in Gaul) for teaching\r\ngrammar to children. Montalembert contends that these charges are all\r\nslanders and that the Pope was not only an unequalled scholar, but that\r\nhe fully appreciated the importance for the intellectual development\r\nof the Church, of a knowledge of the classics. Gregory is quoted\r\nas saying, in substance: “The devils know well that the knowledge\r\nof profane literature helps us to understand sacred literature. In\r\ndissuading us from this study, they act as the Philistines did when\r\nthey interdicted the Israelites from making swords and lances, and\r\nobliged that nation to come to them for the sharpening of their\r\naxes and plough-shares.”[28] Gregory was himself the author of a\r\nconsiderable series of writings, and, while his Latin was not that\r\nof Cicero, he contributed (according to Ozanam) as much as did S.\r\nAugustine to form the new Latin, what might be called the Christian\r\nLatin, which was destined to become the language of the pulpit and the\r\nschool, and which forms the more immediate foundation of an important\r\ngroup of the languages of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nHis works include the _Sacramentary_, which determined the language and\r\nthe form of the Liturgy, a series of _Dialogues_, and a _Pastoral_, in\r\nwhich were collected a series of discourses planned to regulate the\r\nvocation, life, and doctrines of the pastors. Of this book, Ozanam says\r\nthat it gave form and life to the entire hierarchical body. Then came\r\na series of commentaries on the Scriptures, followed by no less than\r\nthirty-five books called _Moralia_, which were commentaries on the\r\nBook of Job. His last important production was a series of _Epistles_,\r\ncomprised in thirteen volumes. He may possibly have been the most\r\nvoluminous author since classic times, and his books had the special\r\nadvantage of reaching circles of readers who were waiting for them,\r\nand of being distributed through the already extended machinery of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nAnother important ecclesiastical author of the same generation was\r\nIsidore, Bishop of Seville. The Spanish Liturgy compiled by him and\r\nknown as the Mozarabic, survived the ruin of the Visigothic Church and\r\nwas thought by the great Cardinal Ximenes worthy of resuscitation.\r\nIsidore also wrote a history of the Goths and a translation of the\r\nphilosophy of Aristotle. He may be considered as the first scholar\r\nto introduce to Europe of the Middle Ages the teachings of Greek\r\nphilosophy. His greatest undertaking was, however, in the form of an\r\nencyclopædia, treating, under the heading of the Seven Liberal Arts,\r\nof all the learning that was within his reach. It was entitled _Twenty\r\nBooks of Etymologies_, or _The Origin of Things_, and included in its\r\nvolumes a number of classical fragments which, without the care of its\r\neditor, would probably have perished forever.\r\n\r\nIsidore is the first Christian who arranged and edited for Christians\r\nthe literature of antiquity. He died in 636, but the incentive that\r\nhe had given to learning and to literature survived him in a numerous\r\ngroup of disciples.[29] Among Isidore’s pupils was King Sisebut, whose\r\ninterest in scholarship caused him to endow liberally a number of the\r\nSpanish monasteries.\r\n\r\n=The Ecclesiastical Schools and the Clerics as Scribes.=--The so-called\r\nsecular clergy were, during the earlier Middle Ages, employed very\r\nlargely in connection with the business of the government, being in\r\nfact in many regions the only class of the population possessing\r\nthe education necessary for the preparation of documents and the\r\npreservation of records. In Italy, towards the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, there came into existence the class of _notaries_ who took\r\ncharge of a good many business details which in Germany and France\r\nwere cared for by the clergy. Under the Merovingian kings, there were\r\ngovernment officials and judiciary officials who were laymen. During\r\nthe rule of the Carlovingians, however, the writing work of the chapel\r\nand of the government offices was consolidated, falling into the\r\nhands of the clerics, or secular clergy. For a number of centuries,\r\noutside of Italy, it was very exceptional for any documents or for any\r\ncorrespondence to be written by other than the clergy. Every citizen\r\nof importance was obliged to have his special _clericus_, _clerc_,\r\nor _pfaff_, who took care of his correspondence and accounts. A post\r\nof this kind was in fact the surest means for an ambitious priest\r\nto secure in the first place, a footing in the world, and later,\r\necclesiastical positions and income. The secretary or chancellor of\r\nthe king, was almost always, as a matter of routine, sooner or later\r\nrewarded with a bishopric.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne took from among the poor boys in the court school, one, who\r\nwas described as _optimus dictator et scriptor_, and having trained him\r\nas chaplain and secretary, provided for him later a bishopric.[30]\r\n\r\nThe use of the word _dictator_ is to be noted as indicating the\r\nmediæval employment of the term in connection with writing. _Dictare_\r\nseems, from an early date, to have been used in the first place to\r\nindicate instruction in the art of writing, while later it is employed\r\nconstantly to specify the direct work of the writer or composer, in\r\nthe sense in which one would say to-day that he had indited a letter.\r\nWith the same general sense, the term _dictamen_ is used for the thing\r\nindited or for a composition. Hroswitha, the nun of Gandersheim (whose\r\npoems later had the honour of forming the material for one of the first\r\nbooks printed in South Germany), used the term _dictare_ continually\r\nfor activity in authorship. Wattenbach quotes from the _Legenda Aurea_\r\nof S. Ambrose the words _libros quos dictabat propria manu scribebat_\r\n(he wrote out with his own hand the books that he composed).\r\n\r\nAs long as any portions of the Roman Empire held together and the\r\nclassic culture still preserved its influence, a considerable class\r\nof men secured their support through work as scribes. In Italy this\r\nclass seems never entirely to have disappeared. Some small circles of\r\nthe people retained, even after the land had been many times overrun\r\nby invaders, some interest in the classics, and were prepared to pay\r\nfor more or less trustworthy manuscript copies of these. In Italy also\r\nthere appears to have been a much larger use of writing in connection\r\nwith trade and commerce than obtained throughout the rest of Europe\r\nuntil a much later time. While in Germany and France such scholarship\r\nas remained was restricted almost entirely to the ecclesiastics and\r\nto the monastery centres, in Italy the Church, during the earlier\r\nperiod, took a smaller interest in scholarship. There came into\r\nexistence, however, a group of literary laymen, who were in a measure a\r\ncontinuation of or a succession to the old Latin grammarians, and who\r\nmaintained some of their interest in classic culture and preserved,\r\nhowever imperfectly, some remnants of classic knowledge.\r\n\r\nWattenbach quotes the words of Gerbert,[31] _Nosti Quot Scriptores\r\nin Urbibus aut in Agris Italiæ Passim Habeantur_ (you know how many\r\nwriters there are here and there throughout the cities and fields of\r\nItaly).\r\n\r\nThe schools established under the rule of the Lombards helped to\r\npreserve the art of writing and to widen the range of its experts.\r\nBy the time, therefore, of the establishment of the earlier Italian\r\nuniversities, an organised class of scribes was already in existence\r\nwhose skill could be utilised for university work, and, as will be\r\nshown more specifically in a later chapter, the universities took these\r\nscribes under their jurisdiction and extended over them the protection\r\nof university privilege.[32]\r\n\r\nIn France, after the time of Charlemagne, it was the case, as we have\r\nseen, that those who had any educational or literary ambitions were\r\nalmost necessarily obliged to become ecclesiastics, as it was only in\r\nmonasteries and in the training schools attached to the monasteries,\r\nthat the necessary education could be secured. As one result of this,\r\nthe number of ecclesiastics increased much more rapidly than the number\r\nof places in which they could be occupied or of foundations upon which\r\nthey could be supported. Priests for whom no priestly work was found\r\nbecame, therefore, what might be called lay-clerics, and were employed\r\nin connection with the work of the courts, or of magistrates, or as\r\nscribes and secretaries.\r\n\r\nIn this manner there came into the hands of these lay-clerics, not only\r\nthe management of correspondence, personal, official, and diplomatic,\r\nbut a very large proportion of the direction of the affairs with which\r\nsuch correspondence had to do. As far, therefore, as the clerical\r\npersonality represented ecclesiastical purposes and aims, the influence\r\nof ecclesiasticism must have been very much greater during the age\r\nin which the art of writing was confined to the Church than at any\r\nearlier or any later period of the world’s history. Such influence was,\r\nhowever, probably less in fact than in appearance, as it seems to have\r\nbeen the case that a very large proportion of such clerics were priests\r\nin name only, and that their interests, purposes, and ambitions were\r\noutside of the Church, and were not necessarily even in sympathy with\r\nthe development of the control of the Church over the affairs of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWattenbach is of opinion that the scribes of this period secured a\r\nlarger return for their work than came to any other class of labourers\r\nor officials. Among many other examples, he gives a quotation from\r\nDümmler concerning a Lombard cleric of Rotland, named Anselm, who, in\r\n1050, prided himself upon the number of books he had written, and said:\r\n_Multos oportet libros scriberes, ut inde precium sumeres, quo a tuis\r\nlenonibus te redimeres_.[33] (You ought to write many books in order to\r\nobtain money with which to buy yourself off from those having claims\r\nupon you.)\r\n\r\nNotker wrote in 1020 to the Bishop of Sitten, who wanted to obtain some\r\nbooks: _Si vultis ea, sumtibus enim indigent, mittite plures pergamenas\r\net scribentibus præmia et suscipietis eorum exempla_.[34] (If you want\r\nthese books, you must send more parchment and also moneys for the\r\nscribes. You will then receive your copies.)\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century, the monks of Tegernsee, under the Abbot Rupert,\r\nwere working on the production of the books for the library of some\r\nnoble lady.[35] The Brother Liaupold, in Mallerstorf, spoke of having\r\n“earned much money through his pen.” This happened in the last quarter\r\nof the twelfth century. The lines quoted by Wattenbach were found upon\r\na manuscript bearing Liaupold’s name.[36]\r\n\r\nFor the libraries of their own monasteries, the monks worked without\r\ndirect pay, and it was only later, as the ambition of the librarians\r\nincreased or as the business of distributing copies of manuscripts\r\nbecame more important, that the monasteries found it worth while to\r\nemploy, either in place of or in addition to their own monks, scribes\r\nfrom outside. In Salzburg, Pastor Peter Grillinger paid, in 1435, to\r\nthe scribes of the neighbouring monasteries three hundred gulden for\r\nthe production of a Bible (probably an illuminated copy), and presented\r\nthis to the library of the Cathedral.[37]\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of the monastery at Aldersbach, Rockinger finds\r\nentries, in 1304, of payments for _scriptores librorum_.\r\n\r\nThe well-known manuscript of Henri Bohic was written in 1374 by a monk\r\nof Corbie, who, according to the cash record of his monastery, received\r\nfor his work, in addition to the parchment and other materials, the sum\r\nof thirty-six solidos. For the monastery at St. Gall, Mathias Burer,\r\nof Lindau, who was chaplain in Meminger, and who died in 1485, wrote\r\ntwenty-four volumes.\r\n\r\nIn 1470, the same Burer gave to the monastery, in exchange for a\r\nbenefice, his entire library. The record does not specify how many\r\nvolumes the library comprised. In 1350, a certain Constantine was\r\narrested in Erfurt as a heretic. Special efforts were made to save him\r\nfrom death or banishment on the ground that he was a skilled scribe.\r\nThe record does not appear to show whether or not this plea was\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nConrad de Mure speaks of women working as scribes during the\r\nlatter part of the thirteenth century. It is probable that these\r\nwomen were nuns, but it is not so specified. In the _Histoire de\r\nl’Imprimerie_[38] reference is made to a woman who appears to have\r\nacted as an independent scribe--that is to say, not to have been\r\nattached to the university or to the guild of booksellers.\r\n\r\nOn the tax list of Paris, in 1292, are recorded twenty-four\r\n_escrivains_.[39] It is probable that the actual number was much\r\ngreater, as the scribes who were ecclesiastics were exempt from\r\ntaxation, and their names, therefore, would not have appeared upon the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nIn 1460, a certain Ducret, _clerc à Dijon_, received from the Duke for\r\nhis work as scribe, a groschen for each sheet, which is referred to as\r\nthe _prix accoustumé_.[40]\r\n\r\nIn 1401, Peter of Bacharach, described as a citizen of Mainz, wrote out\r\nfor the Court at Eltville (Elfeld) a _Schwabenspiegel_. This is to be\r\nnoted because it is an example of scribe work being done by one who was\r\nnot a cleric. Burkard Zink tells us that in 1420, being in Augsburg, he\r\ntook unto himself a wife. She had nothing and he had nothing, but she\r\nearned money with her spinning-wheel and he with his pen. In the first\r\nweek he wrote _vier sextern des grossen papiers, karta regal_, and the\r\necclesiastics for whom the work was being done were so well pleased\r\nwith it that they gave him for two sexterns four groschen. His week’s\r\nwork brought him sixteen groschen, or forty cents.[41] Clara Hatzlern,\r\na citizen of Augsburg, is recorded as having written for money between\r\nthe years 1452 and 1476. A copy of a _Schwabenspiegel_ transcribed by\r\nher was contained in the collection at Lambach.[42]\r\n\r\nThe examples named indicate what was, in any case, probably the only\r\nclass of scribe work done outside of the monasteries and outside of\r\nthe universities or before the university period, by the few laymen\r\nwho were able to write. Their labour was devoted exclusively to the\r\nproduction of books in the tongue of the people; if work in Latin were\r\nrequired, it was still necessary (at least until the institution in the\r\nthirteenth century of university scribes) to apply to the monasteries.\r\nWith the development of literature in Italy, during the following\r\ncentury, there came many complaints concerning the lack of educated\r\nscribes competent to manifold the works. These complaints, as well as\r\nto the lack of writers as concerning the ignorance and carelessness\r\nshown in their work, continued as late as the time of the Humanists,\r\nand are repeated by Petrarch and Boccaccio.\r\n\r\n=Terms Used for Scribe-Work.=--With the Greeks, the term γραμματεύς\r\ndenoted frequently a “magistrate.” The term ταχυγράφοι corresponded as\r\nnearly as might be with our “stenographer.” For this the Romans used\r\nthe form _notarius_. The scribes whose work was devoted to books were\r\ncalled, under the later empire, _bibliographoi_ or καλλιγράφοι. The\r\nname καλλιγράφος was applied to the Emperor, Theodosius II. Montfaucon\r\ngives a list of the names of the Greek scribes who were known to\r\nhim.[43] The oldest dates from 759, and the next in order from 890 A.D.\r\nThe oldest Plato manuscript in the Bodleian library was written in 896\r\nfor the Diaconus Arethas of Patras. Arethas was, later, Archbishop of\r\nCæsarea, and had also had written for him a Euclid, and in 914 a group\r\nof theological works. His scribes were the _calligraph_ John, a cleric\r\nnamed Stephen, and a _notarius_ whose name is not given.[44]\r\n\r\nThe terms _librarius_, _scriptor_, and _antiquarius_ were also used for\r\nscribes making copies of books, while _notarius_ was more likely to\r\ndenote a clerk whose work was limited to the preparation of documents.\r\nAlcuin speaks of employing _notarii_.\r\n\r\nIn the inscription in a manuscript by Engelberg of the twelfth\r\ncentury, we find the lines: _Hic Augustini liber est atque Frowini;\r\nalter dictavit, alter scribendo notavit_.[45] This indicates that\r\nAugustine was the author, while Frowin served as scribe. A manuscript\r\nof the sixth century, contained in the Chapter-House library in Verona,\r\nbears the signature _Antiquarius Eulalius_. A manuscript of Orosius,\r\nwritten in the seventh century, is inscribed: _Confectus codex in\r\nstatione Viliaric Antiquarii_. (A codex completed in the writing-stall\r\nof Viliaric the scribe.) This scribe was probably a Goth, as among the\r\nsignatures in a Ravenna document, containing the list of the clerics\r\nof the Gothic Church, occurs the name _Viljaric bokareis_.[46] Otto\r\nvon Freising says of his _notarius_, Ragewin: _Qui hanc historiam\r\nex ore nostro subnotavit_ (who wrote down this story from my lips);\r\nand Gunther, in 1212, complains of a headache which he had brought\r\nupon himself _ut verba inventa notario vix possim exprimere_, that\r\nis in the attempt to shape the words that he was dictating to his\r\nclerks. It was in Italy that the _notarii_ first became of sufficient\r\nimportance to organise themselves into a profession and to undertake\r\nthe training, for other work, of young scribes, and it was from Italy\r\nthat the scribes were gradually distributed throughout Europe. Their\r\nmost important employment for some time in Italy was in connection\r\nwith the work of the Church, and particularly in the preparation and\r\nmanifolding of the documents sent out from Rome. The special script\r\nthat was adopted for the work of the Papal office was known as _scripta\r\nnotaria_.[47]\r\n\r\nAccording to Wattenbach, the use of papyrus for the documents of the\r\nChurch, and even for the Papal Bulls, extended as late as the tenth\r\ncentury. Sickel speaks of a Bull of Benedict VIII., of 1022, as the\r\nlatest known to him which is written on papyrus.\r\n\r\nThe term _chartularii_, or _cartularii_, was applied to clerics\r\noriginally trained for the work of the Church, but who occasionally\r\ndevoted themselves also to the manifolding of books. In the memoir of\r\nArnest, who was the first Archbishop of Prague, it was related that he\r\nalways kept three _cartularii_ at work in the transcribing of books.\r\nIn the twelfth century, Ordericus speaks of the monks who write books\r\nboth as _antiquarii_ and as _librarii_.[48] Richard de Bury uses the\r\nterm in describing the renewal of old manuscripts, and restricts it to\r\nscribes who possessed scholarly and critical knowledge. Petrarch makes\r\na similar application.[49] The term _dictare_ was, during the Middle\r\nAges, usually employed to describe the author’s work in composing, or\r\nin composing and writing with his own hand, and bears but seldom the\r\nmeaning of “dictate.” The proper rendering would be more nearly our\r\nword “indite.”\r\n\r\nThe term used during the earlier Middle Ages to denote the Scriptures\r\nwas not _Biblia_, but _Bibliotheca_. According to Maitland, the latter\r\nterm has its origin with S. Jerome, who, in offering to lend books to\r\nhis correspondent Florentius, writes: _... et quoniam largiente Domino,\r\nmultis sacræ bibliothecæ codicibus abundamus_, etc.[50] (And since\r\nby the grace of God, we possess a great many codices of the sacred\r\nwritings.)\r\n\r\nIn nearly every instance in which reference is made to the complete\r\ncollection of the Scriptures, the term used is _Bibliotheca integra_,\r\nor _Bibliotheca tota_. It was evidently the case that for centuries\r\nafter the acceptance of the Canon, the several divisions or books of\r\nwhich the Bible consists were still frequently considered in the light\r\nof separate and independent works, and were transcribed and circulated\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n=S. Columba, the Apostle to Caledonia.=--One of the earliest of the\r\nmonks of the North of Europe whose life was associated with scholarship\r\nand intellectual influence, was S. Columba, the Apostle to Caledonia,\r\nwhose life covered the term between the years 521 and 597. Columba\r\nbelongs to the list of Irish saints, although the larger portion of\r\nhis life’s work was done in Scotland. Before he had reached the age\r\nof twenty-five, he had presided over the foundation of no less than\r\ntwenty-seven monasteries in Ireland, the oldest of which were Darrow\r\nand Derry; the latter, having long been the seat of a great Catholic\r\nbishopric, became, under its modern name of Londonderry, the bulwark of\r\nthe Protestant contest against the efforts of the last of the Stuart\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nThe texts have been preserved of a number of songs ascribed to Columba,\r\nand, whether or not these verses were really the work of the monk,\r\nthe tradition that he was the first of the Irish poets doubtless has\r\nfoundation. In the time of Columba, the Irish monasteries already\r\npossessed texts in greater quantity than could be found in the\r\nmonasteries of Scotland or England, but even in Ireland manuscripts\r\nwere rare and costly, and were preserved with jealous care in the\r\nmonastic libraries. Not only was very great value put upon these\r\nvolumes, but they were even supposed to possess the emotions and\r\nthe passions of living beings. Columba was himself a collector of\r\nmanuscripts, and his biography by O’Donnell attributes to him the\r\nlaborious feat of having transcribed with his own hand three hundred\r\ncopies of the Psalter. According to one of the stories, Columba\r\njourneyed to Ossory in the south-west to visit a holy and very learned\r\nrecluse, a doctor of laws and philosophy, named Longarad. Columba asked\r\nleave to examine the doctor’s books, and when the old man refused, the\r\nmonk burst out in an imprecation: “May thy books no longer do thee any\r\ngood, neither to them who come after thee, since thou takest occasion\r\nby them to show thine inhospitality.” The curse was heard, and after\r\nLongarad died, his books became unintelligible. An author of the ninth\r\ncentury says that the books still existed, but that no man could read\r\nthem.[51]\r\n\r\nAnother story speaks of Columba’s undertaking, while visiting his\r\nancient master Finnian, to make a clandestine and hurried copy of the\r\nabbot’s Psalter. He shut himself up at night in the church where the\r\nPsalter was deposited, and the light needed for his nocturnal work\r\nradiated from his left hand while he wrote with the right. A curious\r\nwanderer, passing the church, was attracted by the singular light, and\r\nlooked in through the keyhole, and while his face was pressed against\r\nthe door his eye was suddenly torn out by a crane which was roosting in\r\nthe church. The wanderer went with his story to the abbot, and Finnian,\r\nindignant at what he considered to be a theft, claimed from Columba\r\nthe copy which the monk had prepared, contending that a copy made\r\nwithout permission ought to belong to the owner of the original, on\r\nthe ground that the transcript is the offspring of the original work.\r\nAs far as I have been able to ascertain, this is the first instance\r\nwhich occurs in the history of European literature of a contention for\r\ncopyright. Columba refused to give up his manuscript, and the question\r\nwas referred to King Diarmid, or Dermott, in the palace at Tara. The\r\nKing’s judgment was given in a rustic phrase which has passed into a\r\nproverb in Ireland: “To every cow her calf [_le gach boin a boinin_],\r\nand consequently to every book its copy.”[52]\r\n\r\nColumba protested loudly, and threatened the King with vengeance.\r\nHe retired to his own province chanting the song of trust, the text\r\nof which has been preserved and which is sacred as one of the most\r\nauthentic relics of the ancient Irish tongue. He succeeded in arousing\r\nagainst the King the great and powerful clans of his relatives and\r\nfriends, and after a fierce struggle the King was overcome and was\r\nobliged to take refuge at Tara.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript which had been the object of this strange conflict of\r\ncopyright, a conflict which developed into a civil war, was afterwards\r\nvenerated as a kind of national military and religious palladium. Under\r\nthe name of _Cathac_, or “the fighter,” the Latin Psalter said to have\r\nbeen transcribed by Columba was enshrined in the base of a portable\r\naltar as the national relic of the O’Donnell clan. It was preserved for\r\n1300 years in the O’Donnell family, and as late as 1867, belonged to a\r\nbaronet of that name, who placed it on exhibition in the Museum of the\r\nRoyal Irish Academy. O’Curry prints a fac-simile of a fragment of the\r\nmanuscript, which he believes to be in the hand-writing of S. Columba,\r\nand O’Curry and Reeves are in accord in the opinion that the famous\r\ncopy of the Gospels known as the “Book of Kells” is also the work of\r\nthe poet monk.[53]\r\n\r\nAfter the successful issue of his contest with Finnian, S. Columba\r\njourneyed through the land, making a kind of expiatory pilgrimage for\r\nthe purpose of atoning for the bloodshed of which he had been the\r\ncause. He went for counsel to his soul-friend or confessor, S. Laisren.\r\nThe saint bade him as a penance leave Ireland and go and win souls\r\nfor Christ, as many as the lives that had been lost in the battle of\r\nCuldreimhne, and never again look upon his native land. He finally took\r\nup his abode in the desolate little island of Iona, on the coast of\r\nScotland. Other refugees were attracted to the island by the fame of\r\nthe saint, and there finally came into existence on the barren rocks a\r\ngreat monastery which for centuries exercised throughout Britain and\r\nNorth Europe a wide-spread influence in behalf of higher Christianity\r\nand of intellectual life.\r\n\r\nFrom Iona and its associated monasteries of Ireland and Scotland came\r\nscholarly teachers to France and Germany whose influence was important\r\nin giving a new direction to the work of later generations of monks.\r\nAmong the Continental monasteries in which was developed through such\r\ninfluence a higher range of scholarly activity, were Luxeuil (in the\r\nVosges Mountains), Corbie (on the Somme), Bobbio (in Lombardy), and\r\nSt. Gall (in Switzerland). Wattenbach says that, notwithstanding their\r\nscholarly knowledge, these Scotch monks were wild and careless in their\r\northography. As an example of the barbarity of style and of form, he\r\nquotes a manuscript of the date of 750 (written during the rule of\r\nPepin).\r\n\r\nA number of years later, when, through the monks of Iona and under\r\nthe general direction of S. Columba, a number of monasteries had been\r\nfounded throughout Scotland, Columba had occasion to plead before the\r\nParliament of Drumceitt in behalf of the Bards, who might be called the\r\nauthors of their time, and with whom the poet monk had a keen personal\r\nsympathy. The Bards of Ireland and Britain were at once the poets, the\r\ngenealogists, the historians, and the musicians of their countries, and\r\ntheir position and their influence constituted a very characteristic\r\nfeature of Celtic life in the centuries between 500 and 800.\r\n\r\nThe Irish nation, always enamoured of its traditions, its fabulous\r\nantiquity, and its local glories, regarded with ardent sympathy the men\r\nwho could clothe in a poetic dress all the law and the superstitions of\r\nthe past, and who could give literary form and force to the passions\r\nand the interests of the present. The Bards were divided into three\r\norders: The _Fileas_, who sang of religion and war; the _Brehons_,\r\nwhose name is associated with the ancient laws of the country which\r\nthey versified and recited; and the _Seanachies_, who enshrined\r\nin verse the national history and antiquities, and, above all, the\r\ngenealogies and the prerogatives of the ancient families who were\r\nregarded as especially representative of the national and warlike\r\npassions of the Irish people.[54]\r\n\r\nThe great influence and power enjoyed by the Bards had naturally\r\nproduced not a few abuses, and at the time of the Parliament of\r\nDrumceitt their popularity had suffered and a violent opposition had\r\nbeen raised against them. They were charged with insolence and with\r\ngreed, and they were particularly censured for having made a traffic\r\nand a trade of their poetry, a charge which recalls some of the\r\ncriticisms of classic times.\r\n\r\nThe enmities raised against them had gathered so much force that King\r\nAedh found himself compelled to propose to the Assembly of Drumceitt\r\nthe abolition of the Order and the abandonment, or, as one authority\r\nsuggests, the massacre of the Bards. It would appear as if Ireland\r\nhad been suffering from an excess of poetic utterances and felt that\r\nsome revolutionary methods were required in order to restore to the\r\nland quiet and peace. Montalembert is of opinion that the clergy did\r\nnot take any part in the prosecution of a class which they might, not\r\nunnaturally, have regarded as their rivals. The Bards had, however, for\r\nthe most part kept in friendly relations with the bishops, monks, and\r\nsaints, and each monastery, like each prince and lord, possessed a Bard\r\n(who in later years became an annalist) whose chief office it was to\r\nsing the glory and record the history of the community.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Bards were certainly, as a body, a residuum of the\r\npaganism that had been so recently supplanted, and it is probable\r\nthat the Church, if not joining in the onslaught upon their body, was\r\nnot prepared to take any active part in their defence. It seems as\r\nif the decision of the Assembly, under the influence of King Aedh,\r\nwould certainly have been adverse to the poets. It was Columba, the\r\npoet monk, who saved them. He, who was born a poet and who, to the\r\nlast day of his life, remained a poet, interceded for the Bards with\r\nsuch eloquence and earnestness that his plea had to be listened to.\r\nHe claimed that the general exile of the poets would be the death of\r\na venerated antiquity and of a literature which was a part of the\r\ncountry’s life. “The bright corn must not be burned,” he said, “because\r\nof the weeds that mingled with it.”[55] Influenced by his impassioned\r\nplea, the Assembly yielded at length, under the condition that the\r\nnumber of Bards should be henceforth limited and that the Order should\r\nbe placed under certain rules to be framed by Columba himself. Thus\r\npoetry was to continue to exist, but it was not to be allowed to\r\noppress the community with its redundance.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless the case that one reason for the exceptional fame\r\nof Columba and the large amount of legendary detail that has been\r\npreserved of his achievements, was this great service that he had\r\nrendered to the poets of his time. They showed their gratitude by\r\nexalting his glory in numberless songs and recitals, and it is chiefly\r\nfrom these that has been made up the narrative of the saint’s life.\r\nAnother result of this intervention on the part of the monk for the\r\nprotection of the poets was a still closer association between the\r\nChurch and the literary spirit of the age. All antagonism between the\r\nreligious ideal and the influence of the poetry of the Bards seems from\r\nthis time to have disappeared. The songs of the Bards were no longer\r\nin any measure devoted to the cause of paganism, but music and poetry\r\nbecame closely identified with the ideals of the Church and with the\r\nwork of the monasteries. The Church had preserved the poets, and poetry\r\nbecame the faithful handmaid of the Church.\r\n\r\n=Nuns as Scribes.=--One of the oldest rules relating to convents, that\r\nof S. Cæsarius of Arles, instituted in the fifth century and brought a\r\nhundred years later to Poitiers by S. Radegonde, required that all the\r\nsisters should be able to read and that they should devote two hours a\r\nday to study--_Omnes bonæ litteras discant_, etc.[56]\r\n\r\nWhile the educational work in the convent schools was for the most part\r\nnot carried on beyond what might be called elementary classes, there\r\nwere not a few examples of abbesses whose scholastic attainments would\r\nrival those of the abbots. Montalembert speaks of convents founded,\r\nunder the auspices of S. Jerome, by S. Paula and her daughter, and\r\nis not prepared to admit that in any essential detail the history of\r\nS. Paula is legendary. He reminds us that Hebrew and Greek were the\r\ndaily study of these two admirable women, who advised S. Jerome in\r\nall his difficulties and cheered him under all discouragements.[57]\r\nMontalembert is probably on firmer ground when he speaks of the\r\nscholarly attainments of S. Aura, the friend of S. Eloi, and of the\r\nnun Bertile, whose learned lectures on Holy Scripture drew to Chelles\r\nin the sixth century a large concourse of auditors of both sexes. S.\r\nRadegonde, known by her profound studies of the three Fathers, S.\r\nGregory, S. Basle, and S. Athanasius, is commemorated by Fortunatus, as\r\nis also Gertrude, Abbess of Nivelle, who sent messengers to Rome and to\r\nIreland to buy books.[58] I do not find a record of the date of these\r\nbook-buying expeditions of the abbess.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the list of the learned nuns includes S. Lioba, who was\r\nsaid to be so eager for knowledge that she never left her books except\r\nfor divine service. She was a pupil of S. Boniface, and to her was\r\ndue the framing of the system of instruction instituted after the\r\nmission of S. Boniface in North Germany. Hroswitha, the illustrious\r\nnun of Gandersheim (who died in 997), has been referred to more than\r\nonce. Hroswitha’s dramatic poetry has been preserved for nearly eight\r\ncenturies, and has had the honour of being reprinted as late as 1857.\r\nHer writings included a history in verse of Otho the Great, and the\r\nlives of several saints. Her most important works, however, were sacred\r\ndramas composed by her to be acted by the nuns of the convent. M. Magin\r\npoints out that these dramas show an intimate acquaintance with the\r\nauthors of classic antiquity.[59] Curiously enough, there was, nearly a\r\ncentury earlier, another Hroswitha in Gandersheim, who was the daughter\r\nof the Duke of Saxony, and who became the fourth abbess of the convent.\r\nShe composed a much esteemed treatise on logic.[60]\r\n\r\nCecilia, daughter of William the Conqueror, who was Abbess of Kucaen,\r\nwon fame for her school in grammar, philosophy, and in poetry.\r\nHerrad of Landsberg, who governed forty-six noble nuns at Mont St.\r\nOdile in Alsace, composed, under the name of _Hortus Delictarum_,\r\na sort of cosmology, which is recorded as the first attempt at a\r\nscientific encyclopædia, and which is noted for the breadth of its\r\nideas on painting, philosophy, mythology, and history. This was\r\nissued shortly after the death of William the Conqueror.[61] To the\r\nAbbess of Eichstadt, who died about 1120, Germany is indebted for the\r\npreservation of the _Heldenbuch_, a treasury of heroic stories.[62]\r\n\r\nThe principal and most constant occupation of the learned Benedictine\r\nnuns was the transcription of manuscripts. It is difficult to estimate\r\ntoo highly the extent of the services rendered by these feminine hands\r\nto learning and to history throughout the Middle Ages. They brought to\r\nthe work a dexterity, an elegance of attainment, and an assiduity which\r\nthe monks themselves could not attain, and some of the most beautiful\r\nspecimens of caligraphy which have been preserved from the Middle\r\nAges are the work of the nuns. The devotion of nuns as scribes began\r\nindeed with the early ages of Christian times. Eusebius speaks of young\r\nmaidens whom the learned men of his time employed as copyists.[63] In\r\nthe fifth century, S. Melania the younger distinguished herself by the\r\nbeauty and exactness of her transcripts.[64] In the sixth century, the\r\nnuns of the convent at Arles, incited by the example of the Abbess of\r\nSt. Césaire, acquired a no less brilliant reputation. In the seventh\r\ncentury, S. Gertrude, who was learned in the Holy Scriptures, sent\r\nto Rome to ask not only for works of the highest Christian poetry,\r\nbut also for teachers capable of instructing her nuns to comprehend\r\ncertain allegories.[65] In the eighth century, S. Boniface begged the\r\nabbess to write out for him in golden letters the Epistle of S. Peter.\r\nCæsarius of Arles gave instructions that in the convents which had been\r\nfounded by him and the supervision of which rested with his sister,\r\nthe “Virgins of Christ” should give their time between their prayers\r\nand psalms to the reading and to the writing of holy works.[66] In\r\nthe eighth century the nuns of Maseyk, in Holland, busied themselves\r\nin a similar fashion, not only in writing, but particularly in\r\nilluminating (_etiam scribendo atque pingendo_), in which they became\r\nproficients.[67]\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century, the Benedictine nuns of Eck on the Meuse,\r\nand especially the two abbesses Harlinde and Renilde, attained\r\ngreat celebrity by their caligraphic work and by the beauty of the\r\nilluminated designs used in their manuscripts.[68] In the time of S.\r\nGregory VII., a nun at Wessobrunn, in Bavaria, named Diemude, undertook\r\nto transcribe a series of important works, the mere enumeration of\r\nwhich would startle modern readers. These works formed, as we read in\r\nthe saint’s epitaph, a whole library, which she offered as a tribute to\r\nS. Peter. The production of this library still left time for Diemude\r\nto carry on with Herluca, a nun of the neighbouring convent of Eppach,\r\na correspondence remarkable as well for its grace of expression as for\r\nits spiritual insight.[69] A list of her transcripts is given in the\r\nsection on the _scriptorium_.\r\n\r\nAmong other convent scribes is recorded the name of the nun Gita, in\r\nSchwarzenthau, who made transcripts, about 1175, of the writings of\r\nher abbot, Irimbert. In Mallesdorf, at about the same time, a nun of\r\nScottish parents, named Leukardis, who understood Greek, Latin, and\r\nGerman, was active in the _scriptorium_, and her work excited so much\r\nadmiration that the monk Laiupold, himself a famous scribe, instituted\r\nin her memory an _anniversarium_.[70]\r\n\r\nBrother Idung sent his dialogues concerning the monks of Clugni\r\nand the Cistercians to the nuns of Niedermünster, near Regensburg,\r\n_ut legibiliter scribatur et diligenter emendetur ab aliquibus\r\nsororibus_.[71] In the same century (the twelfth) the names of\r\nGertrude, Sibilia, and other nuns appear on the transcript of the\r\ncodex written for the _Domini Monasterienses_, which codex came into\r\nthe library of Arnstein in exchange for a copy of the _Pastorals_\r\nof Gregory. Johann Gerson, writing in 1423, refers with cordial\r\napprobation to some beautiful copies prepared by the nuns, of the works\r\nof Origen.[72] In St. Gall, where the literary activity of the monks\r\nhas already been referred to, the nuns in the convent of S. Catharine\r\nwere, in the thirteenth and in the first half of the fourteenth\r\ncenturies, also engaged in preparing transcripts of holy books.\r\n\r\n=Monkish Chroniclers.=--In addition to the services rendered by the\r\nmonks in the preservation of classic literature, and in addition also\r\nto the great amount of work required of them in the routine of their\r\nmonastery for the preparation of books of devotion and instruction, a\r\nmost valuable task was performed by many of the monastic scribes in\r\nthe production of the records or annals of their times. The work of\r\nthe literary monks included the functions not only of scribes, but of\r\nlibrarians, collectors, teachers, and historians. The records that\r\nhave come down to us of several centuries of mediæval European history\r\nare due almost exclusively to the labours of the monastic chroniclers.\r\nEven those who did not compose books which can properly be described as\r\nhistorical, have left in their _cartularies_ documents by the help of\r\nwhich the archæologists can to-day solve the most important problems\r\nrelating to the social, civil, domestic, and agricultural life of their\r\nancestors. The _cartularies_, says M. C. Giraud, were the most curious\r\nmonuments of the history of the time.[73]\r\n\r\nWithout the monks, says Marsham (a Protestant writer), we should have\r\nbeen as ignorant of our history as children.[74] England, converted by\r\nher monks, has special reason to be proud of the historians furnished\r\nby her abbeys.[75] One chronicler, Gildas, has painted with fiery\r\ntouches the miseries of Great Britain after the departure of the\r\nRomans. To another, the Venerable Bede, author of the ecclesiastical\r\nhistory of Britain, we owe the detailed account of the Catholic\r\nRenaissance under the Saxons. Bede’s chronicle extends to the year\r\n731. Its author died four years later. Among later monkish chroniclers\r\nmay be mentioned Ingulphus, Abbot of Croyland, whose history extends\r\nto 1091; Vitalis, a monk of Shrewsbury, whose chronicle reached to\r\n1141, and many others. The chronicle of Vitalis gives an animated\r\npicture of the struggle between the Saxons and the Normans, and of\r\nthe vicissitudes during this period of the Church of England. Later\r\nmonastic historians were: William of Malmesbury (_circa_ 1095-1143),\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth (_circa_ 1090-1154), Henry of Huntingdon (_circa_\r\n1120-1180), Roger of Wendover (_circa_ 1169-1237), Matthew Paris\r\n(_circa_ 1185-1259), and Ralph Higden (_circa_ 1280-1370). Further\r\nreference to the work of these English chroniclers is made in the\r\nchapter on Books in England during the Manuscript Period. This series\r\nof monkish chronicles presents, says Montalembert, an inexhaustible\r\namount of information as to the manners, laws, and ideas of the times,\r\nand unites with the important information of history the personal\r\nattractiveness of biography.[76]\r\n\r\nAmong the chroniclers of France are to be noted S. Gregory of Tours;\r\nS. Abbon, of St. Germain des Prés, who wrote the history of the wars\r\nof King Eudes and an account of the sieges of Paris by the Normans;\r\nFrodoard, who died in 968, and who wrote the annals of the tenth\r\ncentury; Richer, whose history covers the period between 880 and 995;\r\nHelgaud, who wrote the life of King Robert; Aimoin, a monk of Fleury,\r\nwho died in 1008, and who wrote a very curious life of S. Abbon and a\r\nrecord of the miracles at Fleury of S. Bénoît; Chabanais, a monk of\r\nSt. Cybar in Angoulême, who died in 1028, and whose record reaches to\r\n1025. It has been republished by Pertz in the fourth volume of the\r\n_Scriptores_. Raoul Glaber, a monk of St. Germain d’Auxerre, wrote a\r\nhistory of his own time in five books, which covers the period from the\r\naccession of Hugh Capet to 1046. Hugh, Abbot of Flavigny, wrote with\r\nconsiderable detail the history of the eleventh century. These various\r\nmonkish chronicles have served as a basis for the first national and\r\npopular monuments of French history. The famous chronicles of S. Denys,\r\nwhich were written very early in Latin, were translated into French in\r\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century. They contain the essence of\r\nthe historic and poetic traditions of old France.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval history of Italy is in like manner dependent almost\r\nentirely upon the records of the literary monks. The great collection\r\nof Muratori is based upon the monkish chronicles, especially of those\r\nof Volturna, Novalese, Farfa, Casa Aurio, and of Monte Cassino. From\r\nthe latter abbey, there sprang a series of distinguished historians:\r\nJohannes Diaconus, the biographer of S. Gregory the Great, who wrote\r\nduring the reign of Charlemagne; Paulus Diaconus, the friend of\r\nCharlemagne; Leo, Bishop of Ostia, first author of the famous chronicle\r\nof Monte Cassino, and Peter Diaconus, who continued its chronicle.\r\nAnother monk of Monte Cassino recounts the wonderful story of the\r\nconquest gained by the Norman chivalry in the two Sicilies, a story\r\nreproduced and completed by the Sicilian monk Malaterra.\r\n\r\nThe list of the learned historians in the German monasteries is also\r\nan important one. The German collections of _scriptories_, such as\r\nthose of Eckard, Pez, Leibnitz, and others, present an enormous mass\r\nof monastic chronicles. Among the earlier chroniclers were to be noted\r\nEginard, Theganus, and Rodolphus of Fulda, who preserved the records\r\nof the dynasty of the Carlovingians. One of the earlier historians\r\nof Charlemagne was a monk of St. Gall, while the chronicles of that\r\nabbey, carried on by a long series of its writers, have left a most\r\nvaluable and picturesque representation of successive epochs of its\r\nhistory. Regino, Abbot of Prüm, wrote a history of the ninth century.\r\nWittikind, a monk of Corvey, wrote the chronicles of the reign of Henry\r\nI., and of Otho the Great. Ditmar, who was at first a monk of Magdeburg\r\nand later Bishop of Mersebourg, has left a detailed chronicle,\r\nextending from 920 to 1018, of the emperors of the House of Saxony.\r\nAmong the eleventh-century writers, is Hermannus Contractus, son of the\r\nCount of Woegen, who was brought up at St. Gall but was later attached\r\nto Reichenau. The history of the great struggle between the Church and\r\nthe Empire was written by Lambert, a monk of Hersfeld, and continued\r\nby Berthold of Reichenau, Bernold of St. Blaise, and by Ekkhard, Abbot\r\nof Aurach.[77] The first historian of Poland was a French monk named\r\nMartin, while another monk of Polish origin, named Nestor, who died\r\nin 1116, composed the earliest annals of Russia (then newly converted\r\nto Christianity) which were known to Europe. Among the monkish\r\nhistorians of the eleventh century, the most noteworthy were William of\r\nMalmesbury, Gilbert of Nogent, Abbot Suger, and Odo of Deuil.\r\n\r\nThe persistent labour given by these monkish chroniclers to works, the\r\ninterest and importance of which were largely outside the routine of\r\ntheir home monasteries and had in many cases no direct connection with\r\nreligious observances, indicates that they were looking to a larger\r\ncircle of readers than could be secured within the walls of their\r\nown homes. While the evidences concerning the arrangements for the\r\ncirculation of these chronicles are at best but scanty, the inference\r\nis fairly to be drawn that through the interchange of books between the\r\nlibraries of the monasteries, by means of the services of travelling\r\nmonks, and in connection with the educational work of the majority of\r\nthe monasteries, there came to be, as early as the ninth century, a\r\nvery general circulation of the long series of chronicles among the\r\nscholarly readers of Europe. Even the literary style in which the\r\nmajority of the chronicles were written gives evidence that the writers\r\nwere addressing themselves, not to one locality or to restricted\r\ncircles of readers, but to the world as they knew it, and that they\r\nalso had an assured confidence in the preservation of their work for\r\nthe service and information of future generations. The historian\r\nStenzel (himself a Protestant) points out that these monkish historians\r\nwrote under certain exceptional advantages which secured for their work\r\na larger amount of impartiality and of accuracy of statement than could\r\nsafely be depended upon with, for instance, what might be called Court\r\nchronicles, that is to say, histories which were the work of writers\r\nattached to the Courts. The monks, said Stenzel, in daring to speak the\r\ntruth of those in power, had neither family nor property to endanger,\r\nand their writings, prepared under the eye of their monastic superiors\r\nand under the sovereign protection of the Church, escaped at once the\r\ncoercion or the influence of contemporary rulers and the dangers of\r\nflattery for immediate popular appreciation.[78] In the same strain,\r\nMontalembert contends that the literary monks worked neither for gain\r\nnor for fame, but simply for the glory of God. They wrote amidst the\r\npeace and freedom of the cloister in all the candour and sincerity of\r\ntheir minds. Their only ambition was to be faithful interpreters of\r\nthe teaching which God gives to men in history by reminding them of\r\nthe ruin of the proud, the exaltation of the humble, and the terrible\r\ncertainty of eternal judgment. He goes on to say that if princes and\r\nnobles never wearied of founding, endowing, and enriching monasteries,\r\nneither did the monks grow weary of chronicling the services and the\r\nexploits of their benefactors, in order to transmit these to posterity.\r\nThus did they pay to the Catholic chivalry a just debt of gratitude.[79]\r\n\r\nThis pious opinion of Montalembert is a little naïve in its expression\r\nwhen taken in connection with his previous conclusion that the records\r\nof the monks could be trusted implicitly for candour, sincerity, and\r\nimpartiality. It is difficult to avoid the impression that in recording\r\nthe deeds of the noble leaders of their time, the monks would naturally\r\nhave given at least a full measure of attention and praise to those\r\nnobles who had been the greatest benefactors to their Order or to\r\nthe particular monastery of the writer. The converse may also not\r\nunnaturally be assumed. If a monarch, prince, or noble leader should be\r\nneglectful of the claims of the monastery within his realm, if there\r\nmight be ground to suspect the soundness of his faith to the Catholic\r\nChurch, or doubt in regard to the adequacy of his liberality to his\r\necclesiastical subjects, it is probable that his exploits in war or in\r\nother directions were minimised or unrecorded. It is safe to assume\r\nalso that after the Reformation, the Protestant side of the long series\r\nof complicated contests could hardly have been presented by the monkish\r\nchroniclers with perfect impartiality. Bearing in mind, however, how\r\nmany personal influences may have operated to impair the accuracy and\r\nthe impartiality of these chroniclers, they are certainly entitled to\r\na full measure of appreciation for the inestimable service rendered by\r\nthem in the long ages in which, outside of the monasteries, there were\r\nno historians. It seems also to have been the case that with many of\r\nthe monks who devoted the larger portion of their lives to literary\r\nwork, their ambition and ideals as authors overshadowed any petty\r\nmonkish zeal for their Order or their monastery, and that it was their\r\naim to present the events of their times simply as faithful historians.\r\n\r\nAn example of this high standard of work is presented by Ordericus\r\nVitalis, who, as an English monk in a Norman abbey,[80] was able to\r\nsay: “I will describe the revolutions of England and of Normandie\r\nwithout flattery to any, for I expect my reward neither from the\r\nvictors nor the vanquished.”[81]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Work of the Scriptorium.=--The words employed at the consecration\r\nof the _scriptorium_ are evidence of the spirit in which the devout\r\nscholars approached their work: _Benedicere digneris, Domine, hoc\r\nscriptorium famulorum tuorum, ut quidquid scriptum fuerit, sensu\r\ncapiant, opere perficiant_. (Vouchsafe, O Lord, to bless this work-room\r\nof Thy servants, that they may understand and may put in practice all\r\nthey write.)[82]\r\n\r\nLouis IX. took the ground that it was better to transcribe books than\r\nto purchase the originals, because in this way the mass of books\r\navailable for the community was increased. Louis was, however, speaking\r\nonly of religious literature; he could not believe that the world would\r\nbe benefited by any distribution of the works of profane writers.\r\nZiegelbauer is in accord with Montalembert and others in giving to\r\nthe Benedictines of Iceland the credit for the collections made of\r\nthe Eddas and for the preservation of the principal traditions of the\r\nScandinavian mythology. He also confirms the conclusion arrived at\r\nby the Catholic historians generally, that the literary monuments of\r\nGreece and Rome which escaped the devastation of the barbarians were\r\nsaved by the monks and by them alone. He cites, as a few examples from\r\nthe long list of classics that were thus preserved, five books of the\r\n_Annals_ of Tacitus, found at Corbie; the treatise of Lactantius on\r\nthe _Death of Persecutors_, preserved at Moissac; the _Auluraria_ of\r\nPlautus, and the _Commentaries_ of Servius on Virgil, preserved in\r\nFleury; the _Republic_ of Cicero, found in the library of Fleury in the\r\ntenth century, etc.[83]\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of the statement that the classics were by no\r\nmeans neglected by the earlier monastery collectors, Montalembert\r\ncites Alcuin, who enumerated among the books in his library at York\r\nthe works of Aristotle, Cicero, Pliny, Virgil, Statius, Lucan, and\r\nTrogus Pompeïus. A further reference to this library will be found\r\nin the chapter on the Monastery Schools. In Alcuin’s correspondence\r\nwith Charlemagne, he quotes Ovid, Horace, Terence, and Cicero, and\r\nacknowledges that in his youth he had been more moved by the tears\r\nof Dido than by the Psalms of David.[84] Loup de Ferrières speaks\r\nof having borrowed from his friends the treatise _De Oratore_ of\r\nCicero, a _Commentary on Terence_, the works of Quintilian, Sallust,\r\nand Suetonius. He says further that he was occupying himself in\r\ncorrecting the text of the oration of Cicero against Verres, and that\r\nof Macrobius.[85] Abbot Didier of Monte Cassino, who later became\r\nPope, succeeding Gregory VII., had transcripts made by his monks of\r\nthe works of Horace and Seneca, of several treatises of Cicero, and\r\nof the _Fasti_ of Ovid.[86] S. Anselm, Abbot of Bec in the time of\r\nGregory VII., recommends to his pupils the careful study of Virgil and\r\nof other profane writers, “omitting the licentious passages.” _Exceptis\r\nhis in quibus aliqua turpitudo sonat._[87] It is not clear what method\r\nthe abbot proposed to have pursued in regard to the selection of the\r\npassages to be eliminated. It is hardly probable that at this time\r\nthere had been prepared, either for the use of the monks or of any\r\nother readers, anything in the form of expurgated editions. S. Peter\r\nDamian seems to have expressed the true mind of an important group\r\nat least of the churchmen of his time, when he referred to the study\r\nof pagan writers. He says: “To study poets and philosophers for the\r\npurpose of rendering the wit more keen and better fitted to penetrate\r\nthe mysteries of the Divine Word, is to spoil the Egyptians of their\r\ntreasures in order to build a tabernacle for God.[88]”\r\n\r\nMontalembert is of opinion, from his study of monastic history in\r\nFrance, that, at least during the eleventh and twelfth centuries,\r\nclassic writers were probably more generally known and more generally\r\nappreciated than at the present day. He points out that the very fact\r\nof the existence of various ordinances and instructions intended to\r\nrepress any intemperate devotion to the pagan writers is sufficient\r\nevidence of the extent of the interest in or passion for pagan\r\nliterature. He cites among other rulers of the Church who issued\r\nprotests or cautions against pagan literature, S. Basil, S. Jerome,\r\nS. Gregory, S. Radbert, S. Peter Damian, Lanfranc, etc., etc.[89] In\r\nthe _Customs of Clugni_, there is a curious passage prescribing the\r\ndifferent signs that were to be used in asking for books during the\r\nhours of silence, which indicates at once the frequency of these pagan\r\nstudies, and also the grade of esteem in which they ought to be held\r\nby the faithful monk. The general rule, when asking for any book,\r\nwas to extend the hand, making motions similar to those of turning\r\nover the leaves. In order, however, to indicate a pagan work, a monk\r\nwas directed to scratch his ear as a dog does, because, says the\r\nregulation, unbelievers may well be compared to that animal.[90]\r\n\r\nAs before indicated, the work of transcribing manuscripts was held\r\nunder the monastic rules to be a full equivalent of manual labour in\r\nthe fields. The Rule of S. Ferreol, written in the sixth century, says\r\nthat, “He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write\r\nthe parchment with his fingers.”[91] It is quite possible that for\r\nmen of the Middle Ages, who had little fondness for a sedentary life,\r\nwork in the _scriptorium_ may have been a more exacting task than work\r\nthat could be carried on out-of-doors. There were no fires in the cells\r\nof the monks, and in many portions of Europe the cold during certain\r\nmonths of the year must, in the long hours of the day and night, have\r\nbeen severe. Montalembert quotes a monk of St. Gall who, on a corner of\r\none of the beautiful manuscripts prepared in that abbey, has left the\r\nwords: “He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour,\r\nbut although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows\r\nweary.” It became, therefore, natural enough to use this kind of labour\r\nas a penitential exercise.[92] Othlo, a monk of Tegernsee, who was born\r\nin 1013, has left an enumeration of the work of his pen which makes\r\nit difficult to understand how years enough had been found for such\r\nlabour. The list includes nineteen missals, written and illuminated\r\nwith his own hand, the production of which, he tells us, nearly cost\r\nhim his eyesight.[93]\r\n\r\nDietrich or Theodoric, the first Abbot of St. Evroul (1050-1057), who\r\nwas himself a skilled scribe (_Ipse manu propria scribendo volumina\r\nplura_), and who desired to incite his monks to earnest work as\r\nwriters, related to them the story of a worldly and sinful Brother,\r\nwho, notwithstanding his frivolities, was a zealous scribe, and who\r\nhad, in industrious moments, written out an enormous folio volume\r\ncontaining religious instruction. When he died, the devil claimed his\r\nsoul. The angels, however, brought before the throne of judgment the\r\ngreat book, and for each letter therein written, pardon was given for\r\none sin, and behold, when the count was completed, there was one letter\r\nover; and, says Dietrich naïvely, it was a very big book. Thereupon,\r\njudgment was given that the soul of the monk should be permitted\r\nagain to enter his body, in order that he might go through a period of\r\npenance on earth.[94]\r\n\r\nIn the monastery of Wedinghausen, near Arnsberg in Westphalia, there\r\nwas a skilled and zealous scribe named Richard, an Englishman, who\r\nspent many years in adding to the library of the institution. Twenty\r\nyears after his death, when the rest of his body had crumbled into\r\ndust, the right hand, with which this holy work had been accomplished,\r\nwas found intact, and has since been preserved under the altar as a\r\nholy relic.[95]\r\n\r\nThere has been more or less discussion as to whether in the\r\n_scriptoria_, it was the practice for monks to write at dictation.\r\nKnittel[96] takes the ground that the larger portion of the work was\r\ndone so slowly, and probably with such a different degree of rapidity\r\non the part of the different scribes, that it would have been as\r\nimpracticable for it to have been prepared under dictation as it would\r\nbe to do copper engraving under dictation. Ebert,[97] confirming\r\nKnittel’s conclusions, points out that when works were needed in haste,\r\nit was probably arranged to divide up the sheets to be copied among\r\na number of scribes. He finds evidence of this arrangement of the\r\nwork in a number of manuscripts, the different portions of which, put\r\ntogether under one cover, are evidently the work of different hands.\r\nWattenbach specifies manuscripts in which not only are the different\r\npages in different script, but the divisions have been written with\r\nvarying arrangements of space; in some cases the space, which had\r\nbeen left for an interpolated chapter having evidently been wrongly\r\nmeasured, so that the script of such interpolated chapter had to be\r\ncrowded together instead of having the same spacing as that of the\r\nbody of the work. Sickel presents examples of the letters of Alcuin\r\nwhich are evidently the work of a number of scribes. Each began his\r\nwork with a new letter, and where, at the end of the divisions, leaves\r\nremained free, other letters were later written in. In the later Middle\r\nAges, however, there is evidence of writing at dictation, and this\r\npractice began to obtain more generally as the results of the work of\r\nthe scribes came to have commercial value. When the work of preparing\r\nmanuscripts was transferred from the monasteries to the universities,\r\ndictation became the rule, and individual copying the exception. West\r\nfinds evidence that as early as the time of Alcuin, the monks trained\r\nby him or in his schools, wrote from dictation. “In the intervals\r\nbetween the hours of prayer and the observance of the round of cloister\r\nlife, come hours for the copying of books under the presiding direction\r\nof Alcuin. The young monks file into the _scriptorium_ and one of them\r\nis given the precious parchment volume containing a work of Bede or\r\nIsidore or Augustine, or else some portion of the Latin Scriptures, or\r\neven a heathen author. He reads slowly and clearly at a measured rate\r\nwhile all the others, seated at their desks, take down his words; thus\r\nperhaps a score of copies are made at once. Alcuin’s observant eye\r\nwatches each in turn and his correcting hand points out the mistakes in\r\northography and punctuation. The master of Charles the Great, in that\r\ntrue humility that is the charm of his whole behaviour, makes himself\r\nthe writing-master of his monks, stooping to the drudgery of faithfully\r\nand gently correcting many puerile mistakes, and all for the love of\r\nstudies and for the love of Christ. Under such guidance and deeply\r\nimpressed by the fact that in the copying of a few books they were\r\nsaving learning and knowledge from perishing, and thereby offering a\r\nservice most acceptable to God, the copying in the _scriptorium_ went\r\non in sobriety from day to day. Thus were produced those improved\r\ncopies of books which mark the beginning of a new age in the conserving\r\nand transmission of learning. Alcuin’s anxiety in this regard was\r\nnot undue, for the few monasteries where books could be accurately\r\ntranscribed were as necessary for publication in that time as are the\r\ngreat publishing houses to-day.”[98]\r\n\r\nAmong the monasteries which, as early as the time of Charlemagne,\r\ndeveloped special literary activity, was that of S. Wandrille, where\r\nthe Abbot Gerwold (786-806) instituted one of the earlier schools of\r\nthe empire. A priest named Harduin took charge of this school. He\r\nwas said to be _in hac arte non mediocriter doctus_. It was further\r\nstated that, _plurima ecclesiæ nostræ proprio sudore conscripta\r\nreliquit volumina, id est volumen quatuor evangeliorum Romana litera\r\nscriptum_.[99] (He had left for one church many books written by the\r\nsweat of his brow, that is to say, a volume of the four Evangelists\r\nwritten in the “Roman letter.”) This expression, _litera Romana_,\r\noccurs frequently in the monastery chronicles and appears to indicate\r\nthe uncial script. The _scriptorium_ of St. Gall, in which was done\r\nsome of the most elaborate or important of the earlier literary work\r\nof the monks, is frequently referred to in the chronicles of the\r\nmonasteries. Another important _scriptorium_ was that in the monastery\r\nof Tournai, which, under the rule of the Abbot Odo, won for itself\r\ngreat fame, so that its manuscripts were sought by the Fathers of the\r\nChurch far and wide, for the purpose of correcting by them copies with\r\nless scholarly authority.[100]\r\n\r\nThe work of the scribes was not always voluntary; there is evidence\r\nthat it was not unfrequently imposed as a penance. In a codex from\r\nLorch[101] occur after the words, _Jacob scripsit_, written in by\r\nanother hand, the lines: _Quandam partem hujus libri non spontanea\r\nvoluntate, sed coactus, compedibus constrictus sicut oportet vagum\r\natque fugitivum vincire_.[102] (Jacob wrote ... a certain portion of\r\nthis book not of his own free will but under compulsion, bound by\r\nfetters, just as a runaway and fugitive has to be bound.)\r\n\r\nThe aid of the students in the monastery schools was not\r\nunfrequently called in. Fromund of Tegernsee wrote under a codex:\r\n_Cœpi hunc libellum, sed pueri nostri quos docui, meo juvamine\r\nperscripserunt_.[103] (I began this book, but the students whom I\r\ntaught, finished transcribing it with my help.)\r\n\r\nThe monk who was placed in charge of the _armarium_ was called\r\nthe _armarius_, and upon him fell the responsibility of providing\r\nthe writing materials, of dividing the work, and probably also of\r\npreserving silence while the work was going on, and of reprimanding\r\nthe writers of careless or inaccurate script. In some monasteries the\r\n_armarius_ must also have been the librarian, and, in fact, as much of\r\nthe work done in the writing-room was for the filling up of the gaps in\r\nthe library, it would be natural enough for the librarian to have the\r\nplanning of it. It was also the librarian, who, being in correspondence\r\nwith the custodians of the libraries of other monasteries, was best\r\nable to judge what work would prove of service in securing new books\r\nin exchange for duplicates of those in his own monastery. Upon the\r\n_librarius_ or _armarius_, or both, fell the responsibility of securing\r\nthe loans of the codices of which copies were to be made. On such loans\r\nit was usually necessary to give security in the shape of pledges\r\neither of other manuscripts or of property apart from manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe scribes were absolved from certain of the routine of the monastery\r\nwork. They were called into the fields or gardens only at the time of\r\nharvest, or in case of special need. They had also the privilege of\r\nvisiting the kitchen, in order to polish their writing tablets, to melt\r\ntheir wax, and to dry their parchment.[104]\r\n\r\nThe custom of reading at meals, while a part of the usual monastic\r\nroutine, was by no means confined to the monasteries. References to the\r\nuse of books at the tables of the more scholarly noblemen are found as\r\nearly as the time of Charlemagne. Eginhart records that Charlemagne\r\nhimself while at supper was accustomed to listen to histories and the\r\ndeeds of ancient kings. He delighted also in the books of S. Augustine\r\nand especially in the _Civitate Dei_.[105]\r\n\r\nIn England, after the Norman conquest, there was for a time a cessation\r\nof literary work in the Saxon monasteries. The Norman ecclesiastics,\r\nhowever, in taking possession of certain of the older monasteries\r\nand instituting also new monasteries of their own, carried on the\r\nproduction of manuscripts with no less zeal. One of the most important\r\ncentres of literary activity in England was the monastery of St.\r\nAlbans, where the Abbot Paul secured, about the year 1100, funds\r\nfor instituting a _scriptorium_, and induced some wealthy friends\r\nto present some valuable codices for the first work of the scribes.\r\nAs the monks at that time in St. Albans were not themselves skilled\r\nin writing, Paul brought scribes from a distance, and, through the\r\nliberality of his friends, secured funds by which they were paid daily\r\nwages, and were able to work undisturbed. It would appear from this\r\ndescription that some at least among these scribes were not themselves\r\nmonks.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, Matthew Paris compiled his chronicles,\r\nthe writing in which appears to have been, for the greater part at\r\nleast, done by his own hand, but at this time, in a large proportion\r\nof the literary work carried on in the English monasteries, the\r\ntranscribing was done by paid scribes. This, however, was much less\r\nthe case in the Continental monasteries. In Corbie, towards the latter\r\nhalf of the century, there is a record of zealous writing on the part\r\nof a certain Brother Nevelo. Nevelo tells us that he had a penance to\r\nwork off for a grave sin, and that he was allowed to do this by work\r\nin the _scriptorium_.[106] During this century, the monasteries of\r\nthe Carthusians were particularly active in their literary work, but\r\nthis work was limited almost entirely to theological and religious\r\nundertakings. An exception is presented in the chronicles of the\r\nFrisian monk Emo. While Emo was still a school-boy, he gave the hours\r\nwhich his companions employed in play, to mastering penmanship and the\r\nart of illuminating. Later, he was, with his brother Addo, a student in\r\nthe schools in Paris, Orleans, and Oxford, and while in these schools,\r\nin addition to their work as students, they gave long hours of labour,\r\nextending sometimes through the entire night, to the transcribing of\r\nchronicles and to the preparation of copies of the so-called heathen\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nEmo was the first abbot of the monastery in Wittewierum (1204-1237),\r\nand it is recorded that the abbot, while his brothers were sleeping,\r\ndevoted his nights to the writing and illuminating of the choir books.\r\nIn this monastery, Emo succeeded in bringing together in the _armarium\r\nlibrorum_ an important collection of manuscripts, and he took pains\r\nhimself to give instructions to the monks in their work as scribes.\r\n\r\nThe quaint monastic record entitled the _Customs of Clugni_ was written\r\nby Ulrich, a monk of Clugni, some time between the years 1077 and 1093\r\nat the request or under the instructions of William, Abbot of Hirschau.\r\nThis was the Abbot William extolled by Trithemius as having restored\r\nthe Order of S. Benedict, which had almost fallen into ruin in\r\nGermany. Trithemius speaks of his having founded eight monasteries and\r\nrestored more than one hundred, and says that next to the reformation\r\nwrought by the foundation and influence of Clugni, the work done by\r\nAbbot William was the most important recorded in the annals of his\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nWilliam trained twelve of his monks to be excellent writers, and to\r\nthese was committed the office of transcribing the Holy Scriptures\r\nand the treatises of the Fathers. Besides these, there were in the\r\n_scriptorium_ of Hirschau a large number of lesser scribes, who wrought\r\nwith equal diligence in the transcription of other books. In charge\r\nof the _scriptorium_ was placed a monk “well versed in all kinds of\r\nknowledge,” whose business it was to assign the task for each scribe\r\nand to correct the mistakes of those who wrote negligently. William\r\nwas Abbot of Hirschau for twenty-two years, and during this time his\r\nmonks wrote a great many volumes, a large proportion of which were\r\ndistributed to supply the wants of other and more needy monasteries.\r\n\r\nThere was often difficulty, particularly in the less wealthy\r\nmonasteries, in securing the parchment required for their work. It is\r\nevident from such account-books as have been preserved, that throughout\r\nthe whole of Europe, but particularly in the north of the Continent\r\nand in England, parchment continued to be a very costly commodity\r\nuntil quite late in the thirteenth century. It was not unnatural that,\r\nas a result of this difficulty, the monastic scribes should, when\r\npressed for material, have occasionally utilised some old manuscript by\r\ncleaning off the surface, for the purpose of making a transcript of the\r\nScriptures, of some saintly legend, or of any other religious work the\r\nwriting of which came within the range of their daily duty.\r\n\r\nThere has been much mourning on the part of the scholars over the\r\nsupposed value of precious classics which may thus have been\r\ndestroyed, or of which but scanty fragments have been preserved in\r\nthe lower stratum of the palimpsest. Robertson is particularly severe\r\nupon the ignorant clumsiness of the monks in thus destroying, for the\r\nsake of futile legends, so much of the great literature of the world.\r\nAmong other authors, Robertson quotes in this connection Montfaucon as\r\nsaying that the greater part of the manuscripts on parchment which he\r\nhad seen (those of an ancient date excepted), are written on parchment\r\nfrom which some former treatise had been erased. Maitland, who is of\r\nopinion that the destruction of ancient literature brought about by\r\nthe monks has been much overestimated, points out that Robertson has\r\nnot quoted Montfaucon correctly, the statement of the latter being\r\nexpressly limited to manuscripts written since the “twelfth century.”\r\nIt is Maitland’s belief that a large proportion of the palimpsests\r\nor doubly written manuscripts which bear date during the twelfth,\r\nthirteenth, or fourteenth centuries, represent, as far as they are\r\nmonastic at all, not monastery writings placed upon classic texts, but\r\nmonastery work replacing earlier works of the monastery _scriptoria_.\r\nPartial confirmation of this view is the fact that so large an interest\r\nwas taken by monks in all parts of Europe in the preservation and\r\ntranscribing of such classical works as came into their hands. In fact,\r\nas previously pointed out, the preservation of any fragments whatsoever\r\nof classical literature is due to the intelligent care of the monks. To\r\nthe world outside of the monastery, the old-time manuscripts were, with\r\nhardly an exception, little more than dirty parchments.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that a great part of such scraping of old manuscripts\r\nas was done was not due to the requirements of the legends or missals,\r\nbut was perpetrated in order to carry on the worldly business of\r\nsecular men. An indication of the considerable use of parchment for\r\nbusiness purposes, and of instances of what we should to-day call\r\nits abuse, is the fact that, as late as the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, notaries were forbidden to practise until they had taken an\r\noath to use none but new parchment.[107]\r\n\r\nThe belief that the transcribing of good books was in itself a\r\nprotection against the wiles of the evil one, naturally added to the\r\nfeeling of regard in which the writer held his work, a feeling under\r\nthe influence of which it became not unusual to add at the close of the\r\nmanuscript an anathema against any person who should destroy or deface\r\nit. A manuscript of St. Gall contains the following:\r\n\r\n  Auferat hunc librum nullus hinc omne per ævum\r\n  Cum Gallo partem quisquis habere cupit.[108]\r\n\r\n[Let no one through all ages who wishes to have any part with Gallus\r\n(the Saint or the Abbey) remove (or purloin) this book.]\r\n\r\nIn a Sacramentary of the ninth century given to St. Bénoît-sur-Loire,\r\nthe donor, having sent the volume as a present from across seas,\r\ndevotes to destruction like to that which came upon Judas, Ananias, and\r\nCaiaphas any person who should remove the book from the monastery.[109]\r\nIn a manuscript of S. Augustine, now in the Bodleian Library is\r\nwritten: “This book belongs to S. Mary of Robert’s Bridge; whosoever\r\nshall steal it or sell it, or in any way alienate it from this house,\r\nor mutilate it, let him be anathema maranatha. Amen.” A later owner\r\nhad found himself sufficiently troubled by this imprecation to write\r\nbeneath: “I, John, Bishop of Exeter, know not where the aforesaid house\r\nis, nor did I steal this book, but acquired it in a lawful way.”[110]\r\n\r\nIn an exhortation to his monks, delivered in 1486, by John of\r\nTrittenheim (or Trithemius), Abbot of Sponheim, the abbot, after\r\nrebuking the monks for their sloth and negligence, goes on to say: “I\r\nhave diminished your labours out of the monastery, lest by working\r\nbadly you should only add to your sins; and have enjoined on you the\r\nmanual labour of writing and binding books.... There is, in my opinion,\r\nno labour more becoming a monk than the writing of ecclesiastical\r\nbooks, and preparing what is needful for others who write them, for\r\nthis holy labour will generally admit of being interrupted by prayer\r\nand of watching for the food of the soul no less than of the body.\r\nNeed also urges us to labour diligently in writing books if we desire\r\nto have at hand the means of usefully employing ourselves in spiritual\r\nstudies. For you will recall that all the library of this monastery,\r\nwhich formerly was so fine and complete, had been dissipated, sold, and\r\nmade away with by the disorderly monks before us, so that when I came\r\nhere, I found but fourteen volumes. It is true that the industry of the\r\nprinting art, lately, in our own day, discovered at Mentz, produces\r\nmany volumes every day; but depressed as we are by poverty, it is\r\nimpossible for us to buy them all.”[111]\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the case that, after the invention of printing, there\r\nwas a time during which manuscripts came to be undervalued, neglected,\r\nand even destroyed by wholesale, but Maitland is of opinion that this\r\ntime had been prepared for by a long period of gradually increasing\r\nlaxity of discipline and morals in many monastic institutions. This\r\nview is borne out by the history of the Reformation, the popular\r\nfeeling in regard to which was undoubtedly very much furthered by the\r\ndemoralisation of the monasteries, a demoralisation which naturally\r\ncarried with it a breaking down of literary interests and pursuits.\r\nThere had, for some time, been less multiplication, less care, and less\r\nuse of books, and many a fine collection had mouldered away. According\r\nto Martene and Mabillon, the destruction due to the heedlessness of\r\nthe monks themselves was largely a matter of the later times, that is,\r\nof the fifteenth century and the last half of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nMaitland is of the opinion that in the later portions of the Middle\r\nAges the work of the monastic scribes was more frequently carried on\r\nnot in a general writing-room, but in separate apartments or cells,\r\nwhich were not usually large enough to contain more than one person.\r\nOwing to the fact that writing was the chief and almost only in-doors\r\nbusiness of a monk not engaged in religious service, and because of\r\nthe great quantity of work that was done and the number of cells\r\ndevoted to it, these small rooms came to be generally referred to as\r\n_scriptoria_, even when not actually used or particularly intended for\r\nthe purpose of writing. Thus we are told that Arnold, Abbot of Villers\r\nin Brabant, from 1240 to 1250, when he resigned his office, occupied a\r\n_scriptorium_ (he called it a _scriptoriolum_ or little writing cell),\r\nwhere he lived as a private person in his own apartment.[112] These\r\nseparate cells were usually colder and in other ways less comfortable\r\nthan the common _scriptorium_. Lewis, a monk of Wessobrunn in Bavaria,\r\nin an inscription addressed to the reader, in a copy he had prepared of\r\nJerome’s _Commentary on Daniel_, says: _Dum scripsit friguit, et quod\r\ncum lumine solis scribere non potuit, perfecit lumine noctis_.[113]\r\n(He was stiff with cold, while he wrote, and what he could not write\r\nby the light of the sun, he completed by the light of night.) There\r\nis evidence, however, in some of the better equipped monasteries, of\r\nthe warming of the cells by hot air from the stove in the calefactory.\r\nMartene mentions that when S. Bernard, owing to the illness produced by\r\nhis early austerities, was compelled by the Bishop of Chalons to retire\r\nto a cell, he could not be persuaded to relax the severity of his\r\nasceticism so far as to permit the introduction of any fireplace or\r\nother means of warming it. His friends, however, contrived, with pious\r\nfraud, to heat his cell without his knowledge, by introducing hot air\r\nthrough the stone floor under the bed.[114]\r\n\r\nThe _scriptorium_ of earlier times was, however, as previously\r\ndescribed, an apartment specially set aside as a general workroom and\r\ncapable of containing many workers, and in which many persons did, in\r\nfact, work together, usually under the direction of a _librarius_ or\r\nchief scribe, in a very business-like manner, in the transcription\r\nof books. Maitland quotes from a document, which is, he states, one\r\nof the very few existing specimens of French Visigothic manuscripts\r\nin the uncial character, and which dates from the eighth century,\r\nthe following form of consecration or benediction, entitled (in\r\nmonastic Latin) _Orationem in scriptorio_: “Vouchsafe, O Lord, to\r\nbless this _scriptorium_ of Thy servants and all that work therein:\r\nthat whatsoever sacred writings shall be here read or written by them,\r\nthey may receive with understanding and may bring the same to good\r\neffect.”[115] (see also page 61).\r\n\r\nIn the more carefully constructed monasteries, the _scriptorium_ was\r\nplaced to adjoin the calefactory, which simplified the problem of the\r\nintroduction of hot air.\r\n\r\nA further evidence, if such were needed, that the larger literary\r\nundertakings were carried on in a _scriptorium_ common room and not\r\nin separate cells, is given by the regulation of the general Chapter\r\nof the Cistercian Order in 1134, which directs that the same silence\r\nshould be maintained in the _scriptorium_ as in the cloister: _In\r\nomnibus scriptoriis ubicunque ex consuetudine monachi scribunt,\r\nsilentium teneatur sicut in claustro_.[116]\r\n\r\nOdo, who in 1093 became Abbot of S. Martin at Tournai, writes that he\r\nconfided the management of the outside work of the monastery to Ralph,\r\nthe prior. This left the abbot free to devote himself to reading and to\r\nsupervising the work in his _scriptorium_. Odo exulted in the number\r\nof writers whom the Lord had given to him. “If you had gone into the\r\ncloister during the working hours, you would have seen a dozen scribes\r\nwriting, in perfect silence, at tables constructed for the purpose.”\r\nOdo caused to be transcribed all of Jerome’s _Commentaries on the\r\nProphets_, all the works of S. Gregory, and all the works that he could\r\nfind of S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, Bishop Isidore, the Venerable Bede,\r\nand Anselm, then Abbot of Bec and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nOdo’s successor, Heriman, who gives this account, says with pride that\r\nsuch a library as Odo brought together in S. Martin could hardly be\r\nparalleled in any monastery in the country, and that other monasteries\r\nwere begging for texts from S. Martin’s with which to collate and\r\ncorrect their own copies.[117]\r\n\r\nMaitland mentions that certain of the manuscripts written in Odo’s\r\n_scriptorium_, including the fourth volume of the _Gregorialis_ of\r\nAlulfus, were (in 1845) in the library of Dr. Todd, of Trinity College,\r\nDublin.[118]\r\n\r\nIn estimating the extent of book production of the manuscript period,\r\nwe may very easily place too large a comparative weight on the\r\nproductive power of the Press. Maitland points out that although the\r\npower of multiplication of literary productions was, of course, during\r\nthe Dark Ages infinitely below that which now exists, and while the\r\nentire book production of the two periods may not be compared, yet\r\nas regards those books which were considered as the standard works\r\nin sacred literature and in the approved secular literature, the\r\ndifference was not so extreme as may easily be supposed. He enquires,\r\nto emphasise his point, what proportion the copies of Augustine’s\r\n_City of God_ and of Gregory’s _Morals_, _printed_ between the years\r\n1700 and 1800, bear to those _written_ between the years 1100 and\r\n1200.[119]\r\n\r\nI think, with Maitland, that, according to the evidence on record,\r\nfor books such as those given above as typical examples, the written\r\nproduction during the century selected would probably have exceeded the\r\nnumber of copies of the same books turned out by the printing-presses\r\nduring the eighteenth century. We must recall to ourselves that for a\r\nterm of six or seven centuries, writing was a business, and was also\r\na religious duty; an occupation taken up by choice and pursued with a\r\ndegree of zeal, persistence, and enthusiasm for which in the present\r\nday there is no parallel.\r\n\r\nMabillon speaks of a volume by Othlonus, a monk of S. Emmeram’s at\r\nRatisbon, who was born about the year 1013. In this book, which is\r\nentitled _De ipsius tentationibus, varia fortuna, et scriptis_, the\r\nmonk gives an account of his literary labours and of the circumstances\r\nwhich led to his writing the various works bearing his name.\r\n\r\n“For the same reason, I think proper to add an account of the great\r\nknowledge and capacity for writing which was given me by the Lord in\r\nmy childhood. When as yet a little child, I was sent to school and\r\nquickly learned my letters, and I began, long before the usual time\r\nof learning and without any order from the master, to learn the art\r\nof writing. Undertaking this in a furtive and unusual manner, and\r\nwithout any teacher, I got a habit of holding my pen wrongly, nor were\r\nany of my teachers afterwards able to correct me on that point; for\r\nI had become too much accustomed to it to be able to change. Those\r\nwho saw my earlier work unanimously decided that I should never write\r\nwell. After a short time the facility came to me, and while I was in\r\nthe monastery of Tegernsee (in Bavaria) I wrote many books.... Being\r\nsent to Franconia while I was yet a boy, I worked so hard at writing\r\nthat before I returned I had nearly lost my sight.... After I became a\r\nmonk in the monastery of S. Emmeram, I was appointed the schoolmaster.\r\nThe duties of this office so fully occupied my time, that I was able\r\nto do the transcribing in which I was interested only by night and on\r\nholidays.... I was, however, able, in addition to writing the books\r\nwhich I had myself composed, and the copies of which I gave away for\r\nthe edification of those who asked for them, to prepare nineteen\r\nmissals (ten for the abbots and monks in our own monastery, four for\r\nthe brethren at Fulda, and five for those in other places), three books\r\nof the Gospels, and two with the Epistles and Gospels, which are called\r\n_Lectionaries_; besides which, I wrote four service-books for matins.\r\nI wrote in addition a good many books for the brethren at Fulda, for\r\nthe monks at Hirschfeld and at Amerbach, for the Abbot of Lorsch, for\r\ncertain friends at Passau, and for other friends in Bohemia, for the\r\nmonastery of Tegernsee, for the monastery of Pryel, for the monastery\r\nof Obermünster and for that of Niedermünster, and for my sister’s son.\r\nMoreover, to many others I gave or sent, at different times, sermons,\r\nproverbs, and edifying writings.... Afterwards, old age’s infirmity of\r\nvarious kinds hindered me.”[120]\r\n\r\nIf there were many hundred scribes of the diligence of Othlonus, the\r\nmass of literature produced in the _scriptorium_ may very easily have\r\nrivalled the later output of the printing-presses. The labours of\r\nOthlonus were, if the records are to be trusted, eclipsed by those\r\nof the nun Diemude or Diemudis of the monastery of Wessobrunn. An\r\nanonymous monk of this monastery, writing in the year 1513, says:\r\n\r\n“Diemudis was formerly a most devout nun of this our monastery of\r\nWessobrunn. [Pez states that Diemudis lived in the time of Gregory\r\nVII., who became Pope in 1073. She was, therefore, though probably\r\nsomewhat younger, a contemporary of the monk Othlonus of Ratisbon.] For\r\nour monastery was formerly double or divided into two parts; that is\r\nto say, of monks and nuns. The place of the monks was where it now is;\r\nbut that of the nuns, where the parish church now stands. This virgin\r\nwas most skilful in the art of writing: for though she is not known to\r\nhave composed any work, yet she wrote with her own hand many volumes in\r\na most beautiful and legible character, both for divine service and for\r\nthe public library of the monastery. Of these books she has left a list\r\nin a certain _plenarius_.[121] The titles are as follows:\r\n\r\nA _Missal, with the Gradual and Sequences._ Another _Missal, with\r\nthe Gradual and Sequences_, given to the Bishop of Trèves. Another\r\n_Missal, with the Epistles, Gospels, Graduals, and Sequences_. Another\r\n_Missal, with the Epistles and Gospels for the year, the Gradual\r\nand Sequences, and the entire service for baptism_. A _Missal, with\r\nEpistles and Gospels_. A _Book of Offices_. Another _Book of Offices,\r\nwith the baptismal service_ (given to the Bishop of Augsburg). A\r\n_Book, with the Gospels and Lessons_. A _Book, with the Gospels_. A\r\n_Book, with the Epistles_. A _Bible_, in two volumes, given for the\r\nestate in Pisinberch. A _Bible_, in three volumes. S. Gregory _ad\r\nregaredum_. _S. Gregory on Ezekiel. Sermons and Homilies of certain\r\nancient Doctors_, three volumes. _Origen on the Old Testament. Origen\r\non the Canticles. Augustine on the Psalms_, three volumes. _Augustine\r\non the Gospels and on the First Epistle of S. John_, two volumes.\r\nAugustine, _Epistles_, to the number of lxxv. Augustine, _Treatises_.\r\n_S. Jerome’s Epistles_, to the number of clxiv. _The Tripartite History\r\nof Cassiodorus. The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius._ S. Augustine,\r\n_Fifty Sermons. The Life of S. Silvester. Jerome against Vigilantius._\r\nJerome, _De Consolatione Mortuorum. The Life of S. Blasius. The Life\r\nof John the Almoner, Patriarch of Alexandria early in the seventh\r\ncentury. Paschasius on the Body and Blood of Christ. The Conflict of\r\nLanfranc with Berengarius. The Martyrdom of S. Dionysius. The Life\r\nof S. Adrian._ S. Jerome, _De Hebraicis Quæstionibus_. S. Augustine,\r\n_Confessions. Canons. Glossa per A. B. C. Composita_ (_i. e._, a Gloss\r\nalphabetically arranged).\r\n\r\nThese are the volumes written with her own hand by the aforesaid\r\nhandmaid of God, Diemudis, to the praise of God and of the holy\r\nApostles Peter and Paul, the patrons of the monastery.”[122]\r\n\r\nThe same writer says that Diemudis (whom he calls _exaratrix\r\ndiligentissima_) carried on a correspondence by very sweet letters\r\n(_epistolæ suaves valde_) with Herluca, who was for thirty-six years a\r\nnun at Eppach, and that the letters were in his time (1513), that is\r\nfour and a half centuries later, extant in the monastery of Bernried.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Influence of the Scriptorium.=--Hildebrand, who, under the name\r\nGregory VII., became Pope in 1073, appears to have made large use of\r\nthe literary facilities of the monasteries to bring effectively before\r\nthe public the doctrinal teachings which seemed to him essential for\r\nthe wholesome development of the strength of the Church in its great\r\ncontest with the imperial power and for the proper rule of the world.\r\nThe histories of the time speak of monks travelling throughout the\r\nEmpire circulating writings in favour of the Church, by means of which\r\nwritings schism could be withstood and the zeal of good Catholics\r\naroused.[123]\r\n\r\nCertain of the monasteries, in connection with their literary activity\r\nin behalf of the Pope, came into special disfavour with the Emperor.\r\nAmong them was Hirschau, the importance of whose literary work has\r\nbeen previously referred to. This monastery fell under the displeasure\r\nof the Emperor Frederick IV., but the monks, says their own annalist,\r\nsustained by their prayers, braved the sword of the tyrant and despised\r\nthe menaces of offended princes.[124] Abbot William of Hirschau had for\r\ntwenty-two years been the soul of monastic regeneration in Germany. He\r\nwas one of the great scholars of his time and had done not a little to\r\nfurther the literary pre-eminence of his monastery, and he became one\r\nof the most valiant defenders of the popes during this contest. Among\r\nother ecclesiastical writers whose pens were active in the defence of\r\nthe papal decrees and in assailing the utterances of the schismatics,\r\nand whose work, by means of the distributing machinery which had\r\nalready been organised between the monasteries, secured for the time\r\na large circulation, were Bernard, at one time master of the schools\r\nof Constance, but later a monk at Hirschau; Bernold, a monk of St.\r\nBlaise; Adelbert, a monk of Constance; and Gebhard, another monk of\r\nHirschau.[125]\r\n\r\nGregory was possibly the first pope who made effective and extended\r\nuse of the writings of devout authors for the purpose of influencing\r\npublic opinion. If we may judge by the results of his long series of\r\ncontests with the imperial power in Germany, the selection of these\r\nliterary weapons was one proof of his sagacity. In this contest, the\r\n_scriptoria_ of the monasteries proved more powerful than the armies of\r\nthe emperors; as, five hundred years later, the printing-presses of the\r\nProtestants proved more effective than the Bulls of the Papacy.\r\n\r\nThe most important, in connection with its influence and consequences,\r\nof the discoveries made by scholars concerning the fraudulent character\r\nof historic documents, occurred as late as the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century. It was about 1440 when Laurentius Valla, at that\r\ntime acting as secretary for King Alphonso of Naples, wrote his report\r\nupon the famous _Donation_ of Constantine, the document upon which the\r\nRoman Church had for nearly a thousand years based its claims to be the\r\ndirect representative in Western Europe of the old imperial authority.\r\nValla brought down upon his head much ecclesiastical denunciation.\r\nThe evidences produced by him of the fact that the document had been\r\nfabricated a century or more after the death of Constantine could\r\nnot be gotten rid of, and, although for a number of years the Church\r\ncontinued to maintain the sacred character of the _Donation_, and\r\nhas, in fact, never formally admitted that it was fraudulent, it was\r\nimpossible, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, even for the\r\necclesiastics themselves to base any further claims for the authority\r\nof the Church upon this discredited parchment.\r\n\r\nOf almost equal importance was the discovery of the fabrication of the\r\npseudo Isidoric _Decretals_. The _Decretals_ had been concocted early\r\nin the ninth century by certain priests in the West Frankish Church,\r\nand had been eagerly accepted by Pope Nicholas I., who retained in the\r\narchives of the Vatican the so-called originals. The conclusion that\r\nthe _Decretals_ had been fraudulently imposed upon the Church was not\r\nfinally accepted until the beginning of the fourteenth century. It\r\nwas with the humanistic movement of the Renaissance that historical\r\ncriticism had its birth, and a very important portion of the work of\r\nsuch criticism consisted in the analysis of the lack of foundation of a\r\nlarge number of fabulous legends upon which many of the claims of the\r\nChurch had been based.\r\n\r\nThere were evidently waves of literary interest and activity in the\r\ndifferent monasteries, between which waves the art of writing fell\r\nmore or less into disuse and the libraries were neglected. In the\r\nmonastery at Murbach, for instance, in which, in the beginning of the\r\ncentury, important work had been done, it is recorded that in 1291\r\nno monks were found who were able to write, and the same was said in\r\n1297 of the more famous monastery of St. Gall.[126] On the other hand,\r\nthe newly organised Orders of travelling or mendicant monks took an\r\nactive interest in preparing and in distributing manuscript copies\r\nof works of doctrine at about the time when, in the older and richer\r\nOrders, literary earnestness was succumbing to laziness and luxury.\r\nWith these mendicant monks, began also to come into circulation a\r\nlarger proportion of original writings, transcribed and corrected, and\r\nprobably to some extent sold by the authors themselves. Richard de Bury\r\nmakes bitter references in his _Philobiblon_ (chapters v. and vi.) to\r\nthe general antagonism of the Church towards literature, but speaks\r\nwith appreciation of the educational services rendered by the mendicant\r\nmonks. Writing was done also by the monks of the Minorite Order, but\r\ntheir rules and their methods of life called for such close economy\r\nthat the manuscripts left by them are distinguished by the meagreness\r\nand inadequacy of the material and the closely crowded script, which,\r\nin order further to save space, contains many abbreviations.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon is said to have come into perplexity because, when he\r\nwished to send his treatises to Pope Clement IV., he could find no\r\none among the Brothers of his Order who was able to assist him in\r\ntranscribing the same, while scribes outside of the Order to whom he\r\nattempted to entrust the work gave him untrustworthy and slovenly\r\ncopies.[127]\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the fourteenth century, it is possible to note a\r\nscholarly influence exercised upon certain of the monasteries by the\r\nuniversities. The most enterprising of the monks made opportunities\r\nfor themselves to pass some years of their novitiate in one or more\r\nof the universities, or later secured leave of absence from the\r\nmonasteries for the purpose of visiting the universities. It also\r\nhappened that from the monasteries where literary work had already\r\nbeen successfully carried on, monks were occasionally called to the\r\nuniversities in order to further the literary undertakings of the\r\ntheological faculties. Finally, the abbots, and other high officials of\r\nthe monasteries, were, after the beginning of the fourteenth century,\r\nmore frequently appointed from among the ecclesiastics who had had a\r\nuniversity training.\r\n\r\nThe library in Heidelberg, the university of which dates from 1386,\r\nreceived from the monastery at Salem a large number of beautiful\r\nmanuscripts, and finally, an illuminated breviary was completed in 1494\r\nby the Cistercian Amandus, who, after the destruction of his monastery\r\nin Strasburg, had found refuge in Salem, where in 1529 he became abbot.\r\nThere is evidence that, at this time, both in Salem and in other\r\nmonasteries in which the business of manifolding and of selling or\r\nexchanging manuscripts became important, a large proportion of the work\r\nof illustrating or illuminating was done by paid artists.\r\n\r\nAfter the reform movement which began with the Council of Basel, there\r\ncame into existence, in connection with the renewal of theological\r\ndiscussions, a fresh literary activity in many of the monasteries.\r\nIn the monastery at Camp, in 1440, the library was renewed and very\r\nmuch extended, and here were written by Guillaume de Reno, _scriptor\r\negregius nulli illo tempore in arte sua secundus_, the _Catholicon_,\r\nbooks of the Mass, and other devotional works. Abbot Heinrich von\r\nCalcar provided Guillaume for eighteen years with a yearly supply of\r\nparchment, valued at seventeen florins, and of other writing material.\r\n\r\nIn Michelsberg, Abbot Ulrich III. (1475-1483) and his successor Andreas\r\nrestored the long-time deserted library, and by work by the scribes\r\nof the monastery and through the exchange of works for the productions\r\nof other monasteries, secured an important collection of manuscripts.\r\nIn 1492, Andreas, abbot of the monastery of Bergen, near Magdeburg,\r\nrenewed the _scriptorium_, which, later, became active in the\r\nproduction of copies of works connected with this earlier reformation.\r\n\r\nAdolph von Hoeck, who died in 1516, Prior of Scheda in Westphalia, was\r\na skilled scribe as well as a zealous reformer. In Monsee, a certain\r\nBrother, Jacob of Breslau, who died in 1480, was said to have written\r\nso many volumes that six horses could with difficulty bear the burden\r\nof them.[128] In the monastery at Tegernsee, already referred to,\r\nthere was, under Abbot Conrad V. (1461-1492), an active business in\r\nthe manifolding and distribution of writings. The same was the case\r\nin Blaubeuern, where, as early as 1475, a printing-press was put into\r\noperation, but the preparation of manuscripts continued until the end\r\nof the century. Among the works issued from Blaubeuern in manuscript\r\nform after the beginning of printing, were the _Chronicles of Monte\r\nCassino_, by Andreas Ysingrin, completed in 1477, and the _Life of the\r\nHoly Wilhelm of Hirschau_, by Brother Silvester, completed in 1492.[129]\r\n\r\nThis year of 1492 appears to have been one of exceptional intellectual\r\nas well as physical activity. It records not merely the completion of a\r\nnumber of important works marking the close of the manuscript period of\r\nliterary production, but the publication, as will be noted in a later\r\nchapter, of a long series of the more important of the earlier printed\r\nbooks in Mayence, Basel, Venice, Milan, and Paris.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, through the first half of the fifteenth century, while many\r\nof the monasteries had fallen into a condition of luxurious inactivity,\r\nwork was still carried on in the Laurentium monastery of Liége by\r\nJohann of Stavelot, and by other zealous scribes, and in several other\r\nof the Benedictine monasteries of the Low Countries the _scriptoria_\r\nwere kept busied. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, and for\r\nsome years after the beginning of the work of the German printers,\r\nthe production of manuscripts in Germany continued actively in the\r\nmonastery of S. Peter at Erfurt, and in the monasteries of S. Ulrich\r\nand Afra in Augsburg, the work of which has been recorded with full\r\nprecision and detail in the famous catalogue of Wilhelm Wittwer.\r\n\r\nIn 1472, in this latter monastery, Abbot Melchior founded the first\r\nprinting-office at Augsburg in order to give to the monks continued\r\nemployment, and in order also to be able to enlarge the library by\r\nproducing copies of books for exchange. It was a long time, however,\r\nbefore the work of the printing-press came to be sufficiently\r\nunderstood to bring to a stop the labours of the scribes in manifolding\r\nmanuscripts for sale and for exchange. The writings of the nun Helena\r\nof Hroswitha, the _Chronicle of Urspergense_, and other works continued\r\nto be prepared in manuscript form after printed editions were in\r\nthe market. The same was the case with the great choir books, which\r\ncontinued during nearly half the century to be very largely prepared\r\nby hand in the _scriptoria_. This persistence of the old methods was\r\npartly due to habit and to the difficulty of communication with the\r\ncentres in which the printing-presses were already at work, but was\r\nvery largely, of course, the result of the fact that in the monasteries\r\nwas always available a large amount of labour, and that the use of this\r\nlabour for the preparation of sacred books had come to form part of the\r\nreligious routine of the institution.\r\n\r\nWith the development of the system of common schools, the educational\r\nwork which had previously been carried on in the convents was very\r\nlargely given up, thus throwing upon the hands of the monks a still\r\ngreater proportion of leisure time. In 1492, Johann of Trittenheim,\r\nAbbot of Sponheim, wrote to the Abbot Gerlach of Deutz a letter, _De\r\nLaude Scriptorum_, in which he earnestly invokes the scribes (he was\r\naddressing the scribes of the monasteries) by no means to permit\r\nthemselves to be deterred from their holy occupation by the invasion\r\nof the printing-presses. Such admonitions might continue the work of\r\nthe monks in certain of the _scriptoria_, but were, of course, futile\r\nin the attempt to preserve for any length of time the business of\r\ncirculating manuscript copies in competition with the comparatively\r\ninexpensive, and often beautiful, productions of the printers.\r\n\r\nAn important part in the work of the preparation and distribution\r\nof manuscripts was taken by the so-called “Brothers of common life”\r\n(_clerici de vita communi_), who later, also occupied themselves with\r\nthe new invention of printing. They cannot properly be classed with\r\nthe scribes of the monasteries, for they made their work a trade and a\r\nmeans of revenue. This practice obtained, to be sure, also with certain\r\nof the monasteries, but it must be considered as exceptional with them.\r\nThe Brothers differed also from the writers in the university towns and\r\nelsewhere, who prepared manuscripts for renting out to students and\r\nreaders, partly because of the special conditions of their Brotherhood,\r\nunder which the earnings of individual Brothers all went into a common\r\ntreasury, but chiefly because they made their work as scribes a means\r\nof religious and moral instruction. The earnings secured from the sale\r\nof manuscripts were also largely devoted to the missionary work of the\r\nBrotherhood. The chief authority for the history of the Brotherhood is\r\nthe work of Delprat, published in Amsterdam in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe Brotherhood house in Deventer, Holland, founded by Gerhard\r\nGroote in 1383, became an important workshop for the production and\r\ndistribution of manuscripts. Delprat states that the receipts from\r\nthese sales were for a time the main support of the Brotherhood house.\r\nIn 1389, a copy of the Bible which had been written out by Brother\r\nJan von Enkhuizen was sold for five hundred gulden in gold.[130] In\r\nLiége, the Brothers were known as _Broeders van de Penne_, because they\r\ncarried quill pens in their caps. Groote seems himself to have taken\r\na general supervision of this business of the production of books,\r\nselecting the books to be manifolded, verifying the transcripts, and\r\narranging for the sale of the copies which were passed as approved.\r\nFlorentius Radewijus had the general charge of the manuscripts (filling\r\nthe rôle which to-day would be known as that of stock clerk) and of\r\npreparing the parchment for the scribes and writing in the inscriptions\r\nof the finished manuscripts. Later, with the development of the Order\r\nand the extension of its book business, each Brotherhood house had its\r\n_librarius_, or manager of the manufacturing and publishing department;\r\nits _rubricator_, who added the initial letters or illuminated letters\r\nin the more expensive manuscripts; its _ligator_, who had charge of the\r\nbinding, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was a distinctive feature of the works prepared by the Brothers that\r\nthey were very largely written in the language of the land instead\r\nof in Latin, which elsewhere was, as we have seen, the exclusive\r\nlanguage for literature. It was, in fact, one of the charges made by\r\nthe ecclesiastics against the Order that they put into common language\r\ndoctrinal instruction which ordinary readers, without direct guidance\r\nof the Church, were not competent to understand, and which tended,\r\ntherefore, to work mischief. In 1398, the Brothers took counsel on\r\nthe point whether it were permissible to distribute among the people\r\nreligious writings in Low German, and they appear to have secured the\r\nauthorisation required. They laid great stress upon the precision of\r\ntheir script, and they were, as a rule, opposed to needless expenditure\r\nfor ornamentation of text or of covers. Under the influence of Groote,\r\nthe work of preparing manuscripts of good books was taken up by the\r\nmonks and the nuns of Windesheim, but, according to Busch, the books\r\nproduced in Windesheim were but rarely sold. In some cases these seem\r\nto have been distributed gratis, while in others they were given in\r\nexchange for other books required for the library of the monastery or\r\nconvent.[131]\r\n\r\nWattenbach says that the Brothers in the Home at Hildesheim were\r\ncalled upon for an exceptional amount of labour in preparing books\r\nof the Mass and other devotional works in connection with the reform\r\nmovement in the monasteries of lower Saxony, which was active in\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century. In the year 1450 (the year in\r\nwhich Gutenberg perfected his printing-press) it is recorded that\r\nthe Hildesheim Brothers earned from the sale of their manuscripts no\r\nless than a thousand gulden.[132] In connection with their interest\r\nin the production and distribution of cheap literature, the Brothers\r\ndid not fail to make very prompt and intelligent utilisation of the\r\nnew invention of printing, and among the earlier printing-offices\r\nestablished in Germany and in the Low Countries were those organised by\r\nthe Brothers at Deventer, Zwoll, Gouda, Bois-le-duc, Brussels, Louvain,\r\nMarienthal, Rostock, etc.\r\n\r\n=The Literary Monks of England.=--In accepting the influence of\r\nliterary ideals, the Anglo-Saxon monks were much slower and less\r\nimaginative than the quicker and more idealistic Celts. The quickening\r\nof the intellectual development of the monasteries in England was\r\nfinally brought about through the influence of Celtic missionaries\r\ncoming directly from Ireland or from the Irish monasteries of the\r\nScottish region, such as Iona and its associates.\r\n\r\nBefore the literary work of the English monasteries began, there was\r\nalready in existence a considerable body of literature, which was\r\nthe expression of the pre-christian conceptions and ideals of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons and their Scandinavian kinsmen. Certain of the most famous\r\nof the literary creations of the Anglo-Saxons were probably produced\r\nsubsequent to the time of the acceptance by the people of Christianity,\r\nbut these productions continued to represent the imagination and the\r\nmethods of thought of the pagan ancestry, and to utilise as their\r\nthemes the old-time legends. These Saxon compositions were almost\r\nexclusively in the form of poems, epics, and ballads devoted to\r\naccounts of the achievements of heroes (more or less legendary) in\r\ntheir wars with each other, and in their adventures with the gods\r\nand with the powers of magic and evil. In these early epics, devoted\r\nchiefly to strife, women bear but a small part, and the element of love\r\nenters hardly at all.\r\n\r\nWhile it is doubtless the case that the Saxon epics, like the Greek\r\npoems of the Homeric period and the compositions of the Celtic bards,\r\nwere preserved for a number of generations in the memories of the\r\nreciters, there are references indicating that the writing of the\r\ntexts on the parchment began at a comparatively early date after\r\nthe occupation of England. This would imply the existence of some\r\ntrained scribes before work was begun in the _scriptoria_ of the\r\nSaxon monasteries. Such lay scribes must, however, have been very few\r\nindeed, and the task of handing down for posterity the old legendary\r\nballads must have depended chiefly upon the _scops_, which was the\r\nname given to the poets or bards attached to the court of a prince or\r\nchieftain. It is, however, not until the acceptance of Christianity by\r\nthe Saxons that there comes to be any abiding interest in letters. As\r\nJusserand puts it: “These same Anglo-Saxons, whose literature at the\r\ntime of their invasion consisted of the songs mentioned by Tacitus,\r\n_carmina antiqua_, which they trusted to memory alone, who compiled\r\nno books, and who for written monuments had Runic inscriptions graven\r\non utensils or on commemorative stones, now have in their turn monks\r\nwho compose chronicles and kings who know Latin. Libraries are formed\r\nin the monasteries; schools are attached to them; manuscripts are thus\r\ncopied and illuminated in beautiful caligraphy and in splendid colours.\r\nThe volutes and knots with which the worshippers of Woden ornamented\r\ntheir _fibulæ_, their arms, the prows of their ships, are reproduced in\r\npurple and azure, the initials of the Gospels. The use made of them is\r\ndifferent, the taste remains the same.”\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly the case that the preservation of such fragments of\r\nAnglo-Saxon literature as have come down to us, and probably of most\r\nof the Scandinavian compositions which were transmitted through the\r\nSaxons, was due to the monastery scribes whose copies were in part\r\ntranscribed from the earlier parchments and in part were taken down\r\nfrom the recitals made in the monasteries by the bards or minstrels.\r\nThe service was in fact similar to that previously rendered by the\r\nIrish monks to Celtic literature, and by the scribes of Gaul and Italy\r\nto the writings of classic times.\r\n\r\nThe identity or kinship of much of the heroic poetry of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons with that of the Scandinavians is pointed out by Grein in\r\nhis _Anglo-Saxon Library_, and by Vigfusson and York-Powell in their\r\n_Corpus Poeticum Boreale_. The greatest of the old English epics,\r\n_Beowulf_, sometimes called “the Iliad of the Saxons,” was put into\r\nwritten form some time in the eighth century and, like all similar\r\nepics, was doubtless the result of the weaving together of a series\r\nof ballads of varied dates and origins. The text of the poem has been\r\npreserved almost complete in a manuscript, now placed in the Cottonian\r\ncollection in the British Museum, which dates from the latter part of\r\nthe tenth century.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that, as a matter of convenience in a brief\r\nreference of this kind, I am using the term Saxon and Anglo-Saxon in\r\nno strict ethnological sense, but simply to designate the Teutonic\r\nelement of the people of England, an element whose influence is usually\r\nconsidered to have begun with the landing of Hengist and Horsa in 451.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Anglo-Saxon monks to be ranked as a poet appears to\r\nhave been the cowherd Cædmon, a vassal of the Abbess Hilda and a monk\r\nof Whitby. Caædmon’s songs were sung about 670. He is reported to have\r\nput into verse the whole of Genesis and Exodus, and, later, the life of\r\nChrist and the Acts of the Apostles, but his work was not limited to\r\nthe paraphrasing of the Scriptures. A thousand years before the time\r\nof _Paradise Lost_, the Northumbrian monk sang before the Abbess Hilda\r\nthe _Revolt of Satan_. Fragments of this poem, discovered by Archbishop\r\nUsher, and printed for the first time in 1655, have been preserved, and\r\nhave since that date been frequently published.[133] Cædmon died in\r\n680, and Milton in 1674. The Abbess Hilda, who was herself a princess\r\nof royal family, appears to have had a large interest in furthering the\r\nstudy of literature, not only in the nunnery founded by her, but in a\r\nneighbouring monastery which came largely under her influence. In both\r\nnunnery and monastery, schools for the children of the district were\r\ninstituted, which schools were probably the earliest of their class in\r\nthat portion of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Northumbrian poet Cynewulf, whose work was done between the\r\nyears 760 and 800, may be referred to as a connecting link between\r\nthe group of national or popular bards and the literary workers of\r\nthe Church. His earlier years were passed as a wandering minstrel,\r\nbut later in life he passed through some religious experience and\r\nentered a monastery, devoting himself thereafter to religious poetry.\r\nHis conversion was doubtless the means of preserving (through the\r\n_scriptorium_ of his monastery) such of his compositions as have\r\nremained, and thus of making a place for his name among the authors of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier Saxon monks whose educational work was important are\r\nto be included S. Wilfred (634-709) and S. Cuthbert (637-687). Wilfred\r\nintroduced into England the Rule of the Benedictines, and exercised\r\na most important influence in instituting Benedictine monasteries\r\nand in bringing these monasteries into relations with the Church of\r\nRome. His life was a stormy one, but notwithstanding the various\r\ncontentions with the several monarchs who at that time divided between\r\nthem the territory of England, and in spite of several periods of\r\nbanishment, he found time to carry on a great work in furthering the\r\nintellectual life of his Benedictine monks. It was largely due to him\r\nthat the Benedictine monasteries accepted almost from the first the\r\nresponsibility of conducting the schools of the land. These schools\r\nachieved so great repute that Anglo-Saxons of high rank were eager\r\nto confide their children to Wilfred to be brought up in one of his\r\nmonastic establishments. At the close of their school training they\r\nwere to choose between the service of God and that of the King. Wilfred\r\nis also to be credited with the establishing within the English\r\nmonasteries of a course of musical instruction, the teachers of which\r\nhad largely been trained in the great school of Gregorian music at\r\nCanterbury.\r\n\r\nAnother of the Saxon abbots whose name remains associated with the\r\nintellectual life of the monasteries was Benedict Biscop. Montalembert\r\nspeaks of Biscop as representing science and art in the Church, as\r\nWilfred had stood for the organising of the English Church as a public\r\nbody, and Cuthbert for the renewal and development of its life. The\r\nmonasteries of Wearmouth and of Yarrow, founded by Biscop, were\r\nendowed with great libraries and became the centres of an active\r\nliterary life. Biscop made no less than six journeys to Rome in the\r\ninterest of his monastery work, and, in the seventh century, a journey\r\nto Rome from Britain was not an easy experience. His fourth expedition,\r\nbegun in the year 671, was undertaken partly in the interests of\r\nliterature and for the purpose of securing books for the education of\r\nhis monks. He obtained in the Papal capital a rich cargo of books,\r\nsome of which he had purchased while others were given to him. In\r\nVienne, the ancient capital of Gaul, he secured a further collection.\r\nThe monastery of Wearmouth, founded in 673, had the benefit of a large\r\nportion of the books brought from Italy by the abbot. It was his\r\ndesire that each monastery for which he was responsible should possess\r\na library, which seemed to him indispensable for the instruction,\r\ndiscipline, and the good organisation of the community. Biscop’s fifth\r\njourney was made partly for the purpose of securing pictures, coloured\r\nimages, and artistic decorations for the chapel of the monastery, but\r\nthe sixth pilgrimage, made in 685, was again devoted almost entirely to\r\nthe collection of books.\r\n\r\nFor the details of the work of Biscop in the organisation of his\r\nmonasteries and in the supervision of the work in their _scriptoria_,\r\nand concerning his various architectural and artistic undertakings, we\r\nare largely indebted to the historian Beda, or Bede. Bede was a pupil\r\nof Biscop in the monastery of Yarrow, and it was in this monastery that\r\nwere written the famous _Chronicles_. It was the time of comparative\r\npeace in the island which preceded the first Danish invasion. The fame\r\nof the scholar who produced these chronicles was destined to eclipse\r\nthat of nearly all the Saxon saints and kings, who were in fact known\r\nto posterity principally through the pen of the Venerable Bede. It is\r\nto Biscop, however, that should be credited the literary surroundings\r\nunder which Bede was educated, and it is probable that without\r\nthe stimulating influence of the books secured by the abbot in his\r\nwearisome journeys to Southern Europe, the monk would hardly have had\r\nthe capacity or the incentive to complete his work.\r\n\r\nCoelfried, who later became Abbot of Yarrow, and who, after the death\r\nof Biscop, was in charge also of the monastery of Wearmouth, continued\r\nthe interest of his predecessor in the libraries and in the work done\r\nby the scribes in the _scriptoria_. Among the books brought from Rome\r\nby Biscop was a curious work on cosmography, which King Alfred was\r\nvery anxious to possess. Abbot Coelfried finally consented to let the\r\nKing have the book in exchange for land sufficient to support eight\r\nfamilies. Coelfried had had made in the _scriptorium_ of Wearmouth two\r\ncomplete copies of the Bible according to the version of S. Jerome, the\r\ntext of which had been brought from Rome. These copies were placed, one\r\nin the church of Wearmouth and one in that of Yarrow, and were open\r\nfor the use not only of the monks, but of any others who might desire\r\nto consult them and who might be able to read the script. Montalembert\r\nrefers to this instance as a refutation of “the stupid calumny” which\r\nrepresents the Church as having in former times interdicted to her\r\nchildren the knowledge of the sacred Scriptures.[134]\r\n\r\nWhen Aldhelm, who became Bishop of Sherborn in the year 705, went\r\nto Canterbury to be consecrated by his old friend and companion\r\nBerthwold (_pariter literis studuerant, pariterque viam religionis\r\ntriverant_--together they had studied literature and together they had\r\nfollowed the path of religion), the Archbishop kept him there many\r\ndays, taking counsel with him about the affairs of his diocese. Hearing\r\nof the arrival during this time of ships at Dover, he went there to\r\ninspect their unloading and to see if they had brought anything in his\r\nway (_si quid forte commodum ecclesiastico usui attulissent nautæ qui\r\ne Gallico sinu in Angliam provecti librorum copiam apportassent_--to\r\nsee whether the ships which had arrived from the French coast had\r\nbrought, with the books which formed a part of their cargoes, any\r\nvolumes of value for the work of the Church). Among many other books\r\nhe saw one containing the whole of the Old and New Testaments, which\r\nbook he bought, and which, according to William of Malmesbury, who in\r\nthe twelfth century wrote the life of Aldhelm, was at that time still\r\npreserved at Sherborn.[135]\r\n\r\nThe great Bible given by King Offa, in 780, to the church at Worcester\r\nis described in the chronicle of Malmesbury as _Magnam Bibliam_.[136]\r\nAs before indicated, however, the common name of this time for a\r\ncollection of the Scriptures was not _Biblia_ but _Bibliotheca_. In\r\na return of their property which the monks of St. Riquier at Centule\r\nmade in the year 831, by order of Louis the Débonnaire, we find, among\r\na considerable quantity of books: _Bibliotheca integra ubi continentur\r\nlibri lxxii., in uno volumine_ (a complete Bible, in which seventy-two\r\nbooks are comprised in one volume), and also _Bibliotheca dispersa in\r\nvoluminibus xiv._[137] (a Bible divided into fourteen volumes).\r\n\r\nFleury says of Olbert, Abbot of Gembloux: _Étant abbé, il amassa à\r\nGembloux plus de cent volumes d’auteurs ecclésiastiques, et cinquante\r\nd’auteurs profanes, ce qui passoit pour une grande Bibliothèque_.[138]\r\nWarton, using Fleury for his authority, speaks of the “incredible\r\nlabour and immense expense” which Olbert had given to the formation\r\nof this library. There is, however, no authority in the quotation\r\nfrom Fleury for such a description of the exceptional nature of the\r\nlabour and of the outlay. On the contrary, Fleury goes on to say that\r\nOlbert, who had been sent to reform and restore the monastery, which\r\nwas in a state of great poverty and disorder, had put the monks to\r\nwork at writing, in order to keep them from being idle. He himself set\r\nan example of industry as a scribe by writing out, with his own hand,\r\nthe whole of the Old and the New Testament, a work which was completed\r\nin the year 1040.[139] Maitland calculates that a scribe must be both\r\nexpert and industrious to perform in less than ten months the task\r\nof transcribing all the books of the Old and the New Testament. He\r\nestimates, further, that at the rate at which the law stationers of\r\nLondon paid their writers in his time (1845), such a transcript would\r\ncost, for the writing only, between sixty and seventy pounds.[140]\r\n\r\nThe sterling service rendered by King Alfred to the literary interests\r\nof England was important in more ways than one, and while his work does\r\nnot strictly belong to the record of the English monasteries, it may\r\nproperly enough be associated with the literary history of the English\r\nChurch; for the King had been adopted as a spiritual son by Pope Leo\r\nIV., and in organising and supervising the work of the Church, he took\r\nupon himself a large measure of the responsibilities which later were\r\ndischarged by the Primate. Alfred ruled over the West Saxons from 871\r\nto 901. His reign was a stormy one, and during a number of years it\r\nseemed doubtful whether the existence of the little Saxon Kingdom could\r\nbe maintained against the assaults of the Danes. There came finally,\r\nhowever, a period of peace when Alfred, with Winchester as his capital,\r\nwas able to give attention to the organisation of education in his\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nDuring the long years of invasion and of civil war, the literary\r\ninterests and culture that had come to the Saxons through the Romans\r\nhad been in great part swept away. The collections of books had been\r\nburned and could not be replaced because the clerics had forgotten\r\ntheir Latin. Alfred complained that at the time of his accession in\r\nWinchester he could not find south of the Thames a single Englishman\r\nable to translate a letter from Latin into English. “When I considered\r\nall this, I remembered also how I saw, before it had all been ravaged\r\nand burned, how the churches throughout the whole of England stood\r\nfilled with treasures and books, and there was also a great multitude\r\nof God’s servants, but they had very little knowledge of the books;\r\nthey could not understand any of them because they were not written\r\nin their own language.” Alfred can find but one explanation for the\r\nomission of the “good and wise men who were formerly all over England”\r\nto leave translations of these books. “They did not think that men\r\ncould ever be so careless and that learning could so soon decay.”\r\nThe King recalls, however, that there are still left many who “can\r\nread English writing.” “I began therefore among the many and manifold\r\ntroubles of this Kingdom, to translate into English the book which\r\nis called in Latin _Pastoralis_ and in English _Shepherd’s Book_\r\n(_Hirdeboc_), sometimes word for word and sometimes according to the\r\nsense, as I had learned it from Plegmund, my Archbishop, and Asser, my\r\nBishop, and Grimbold my Mass-priest, and John my Mass-priest.”[141] It\r\nwill be noted in these references of King Alfred, that the collections\r\nof books, the loss of which he laments, had been contained in the\r\nchurches. It was also to the ecclesiastics that he was turning for help\r\nin the work of rendering into English the instruction for his people to\r\nbe found in the few Latin volumes that had been preserved.\r\n\r\nJusserand says that Asser was to Alfred what Alcuin had been to\r\nCharlemagne, and that he helped the King, by means of the production\r\nof translations and by founding schools, to preserve and to spread\r\nlearning. King Alfred was, however, not content with using his royal\r\nauthority and influence for the instituting of schools, but himself\r\ngave to work as a translator personal time and labour which must\r\nhave been spared with difficulty from his duties as a ruler and as a\r\nmilitary commander. He chooses for his translations books likely to\r\nfill up the greatest gaps in the minds of his countrymen, “some books\r\nthat are most needful for all men to know”: the _Book of Orosius_,\r\nwhich is to serve as a hand-book of universal history; the _Chronicles\r\nof Bede_, that will instruct them concerning the history of their own\r\nancestors; the _Pastoral Rule of S. Gregory_, which will make clear\r\nto churchmen their ecclesiastical duties; and the _Consolation of\r\nPhilosophy of Boëthius_, recommended as a guide for the lives of both\r\necclesiastics and laymen. These royal translations are at once placed\r\nin the _scriptoria_ of the monasteries and in the writing-rooms of the\r\nmonastery schools for manifolding, and secure through these channels an\r\nimmediate and important educational influence.\r\n\r\nIt is also under the instructions of Alfred that the old national\r\nchronicles, written in the Anglo-Saxon tongue, are copied, corrected,\r\nand continued. Of these chronicles, seven, more or less complete and\r\ndiffering from each other to some extent, have been preserved. The\r\nhistory of the world presents possibly no other instance of a monarch\r\nwho devoted himself so steadfastly, with his own personal labour, to\r\nthe educational and spiritual development of his people.\r\n\r\nIn the latter portion of the tenth century, S. Dunstan, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury under King Edgar, takes up the task of instructing the\r\nclergy and people. Under his influence, new monasteries are endowed,\r\na further series of monastery schools is instituted, and special\r\nattention is given in the _scriptoria_ and in the writing-rooms of the\r\nschools to the production of copies of translations of pious works.\r\nThe special literary feature of the work done in Dunstan’s school was\r\nthe attention given to the production of collections of sermons in the\r\nvulgar tongue. A number of these collections has been preserved, an\r\nexample of which, known as the _Blickling Homilies_ (from Blickling\r\nHall, Norfolk, where the MS. was found) was compiled before 971. The\r\nseries also included homilies by Ælfric, who was Abbot of Eynsham in\r\n1005, and sermons of Wulfstan, who was Bishop of York in 1002.\r\n\r\nThe canons of Ælfric were written between the years 950 and 1000. The\r\nauthorities do not appear to be clear whether these canons were the\r\nwork of the Archbishop or of a grammarian of the same name, while,\r\naccording to one theory, the Archbishop and the grammarian were the\r\nsame person. The canons were addressed to Wulfin, Bishop of Sherborn,\r\nand they were written in such a form that the Bishop might communicate\r\nthem to his clergy as a kind of episcopal charge. The twenty-first\r\ncanon orders: “Every priest also, before he is ordained, must have\r\nthe arms belonging to his spiritual work; that is, the holy books,\r\nnamely, the _Psalter_, the _Book of Epistles_, the _Book of Gospels_,\r\nthe _Missal_, the _Book of Hymns_, the _Manual_, the _Calendar_\r\n(_Computus_), the _Passional_, the _Penitential_, the _Lectionary_.\r\nThese books a priest requires and cannot do without, if he would\r\nproperly fulfil his office and desires to teach the law to the people\r\nbelonging to him. And let him carefully see that they are well\r\nwritten.”[142]\r\n\r\nThe library of the English monastery or priory was under the care of\r\nthe chantor, who could neither sell, pawn, nor lend books without an\r\nequivalent pledge; he might, however, with respect to neighbouring\r\nchurches or to persons of consideration, relax somewhat the strictness\r\nof this rule. In the case of a new foundation, the King sometimes sent\r\nletters-patent to the different abbeys requesting them to give copies\r\nof theological and religious books in their own collections. In certain\r\ninstances, the King himself provided such transcripts for the new\r\nfoundation. In the catalogue of the abbatial libraries of England,\r\nprepared by Leland, record is found of only the following classics:\r\nCicero and Aristotle (these two appear in nearly all the catalogues),\r\nTerence, Euclid, Quintus Curtius, Sidonius Apollinaris, Julius\r\nFrontinus, Apuleius, and Seneca.[143] It is difficult from such a list\r\nto arrive at the basis or standard of selection.\r\n\r\nThomas Duffus Hardy gives some interesting information concerning\r\nthe later literary and historical work done in the monasteries of\r\nBritain,[144] and for a portion of the following notes concerning\r\nthis work I am chiefly indebted to him. The Abbey of St. Albans was\r\nfounded towards the close of the eighth century, but it was not until\r\nthe latter part of the eleventh century, or nearly three hundred years\r\nlater, that the _scriptorium_ was instituted. The organisation of the\r\n_scriptorium_ was due to Paul, the fourteenth abbot, who presided\r\nover the monastery from 1077 to 1093, and who had the assistance in\r\nthis work of the Bishop Lanfranc. Paul was by birth a Norman, and was\r\nesteemed a man of learning as well as of piety. After the _scriptorium_\r\nhad been opened, the abbot placed in it eight _Psalters_, a _Book of\r\nCollects_, a _Book of Epistles_, a book containing the Gospels for the\r\nyear, two _Gospels_ bound in gold and silver and ornamented with gems,\r\nand twenty-eight other notable volumes. In addition to these, there was\r\na number of ordinals, costumals, missals, troparies, collectories, and\r\nother books for the use of the monks in their devotions. This summary\r\nof the first contents of the library is taken by Hardy from the _Gesta\r\nAbbatum_, a chronicle of St. Albans.\r\n\r\nThe literary interests of Paul were, it appears, continued by a\r\nlarge proportion at least of his successors, and many of these made\r\nimportant contributions to the library. Geoffrey, the sixteenth abbot,\r\ngave to the _scriptorium_ a missal bound in gold, and another missal in\r\ntwo volumes, both incomparably illuminated in gold and written in an\r\nopen and legible script. He also gave a precious illuminated psalter, a\r\nbook containing the benediction and sacraments, a book of exorcism, and\r\na collectory. (The description is taken from the _Gesta_.)\r\n\r\nRalph, the seventeenth abbot, was said to have become a lover of books\r\nafter having heard Wodo of Italy expound the Scriptures. He collected\r\nwith diligence a large number of valuable manuscripts. Robert de\r\nGorham, who was called the reformer of the liberty of the Church of St.\r\nAlbans, after becoming prior, gave many books to the _scriptorium_,\r\nmore than could be mentioned by the author of the _Gesta_. Simon,\r\nwho became abbot in 1166, caused to be created the office of\r\nhistoriographer. Simon had been educated in the abbey, and did not a\r\nlittle to add to its fame as a centre of literature. He repaired and\r\nenlarged the _scriptorium_, and he kept two or three scribes constantly\r\nemployed in it. The previous literary abbots had for the most part\r\nbrought from without the books added to the collection, but it was\r\nunder Simon that the abbey became a place of literary production as\r\nwell as of literary reproduction. He had an ordinance enacted to the\r\neffect that every abbot must support out of his personal funds one\r\nadequate scribe. Simon presented to the abbey a considerable group\r\nof books that he had himself been collecting before his appointment\r\nas abbot, together with a very beautiful copy of the Old and New\r\nTestaments.\r\n\r\nThe next literary abbot was John de Cell, who had been educated in the\r\nschools of Paris, and who was profoundly learned in grammar, poetry,\r\nand physics. On being elected abbot, he gave over the management of\r\nthe temporal affairs of the abbey to his prior, Reymond, and devoted\r\nhimself to religious duties and to study. Reymond himself was a\r\nzealous collector, and it was through him that was secured for the\r\nlibrary, among many other books, a copy of the _Historica Scholastica\r\ncum Allegoriis_, of Peter Comester. The exertions of these scholarly\r\nabbots and priors won for St. Albans a special distinction among\r\nthe monasteries of Britain, and naturally led to the compilation of\r\nthe historic annals which gave to the abbey a continued literary\r\nfame. Hardy is of opinion that these historic annals date from the\r\nadministration of Simon, between the years 1166 and 1183.\r\n\r\nRichard of Wendover, who succeeded Walter as historiographer, compiled,\r\nbetween the years 1230 and 1236, the _Flores Historiarum_, one of the\r\nmost important of the earlier chronicles of England. Hardy points out\r\nthat it could have been possible to complete so great a work within\r\nthe term of six years, only on the assumption that Richard found\r\navailable much material collected by Walter, and it is also probable\r\nthat other compilations were utilised by Richard for the work bearing\r\nhis name. It is to be borne in mind that the monastic chronicles were\r\nbut seldom the production of a single hand, as was the case with the\r\nchronicles of Malmesbury and of Beda. The greater number of such\r\nchronicles grew up from period to period, fresh material being added in\r\nsucceeding generations, while in every monastic house in which there\r\nwere transcribers, fresh local information was interpolated until the\r\ntributary streams had grown more important than the original current.\r\nIn this manner, the monastic annals were at one time a transcript, at\r\nanother time an abridgment, and at another an original work. “With the\r\nchronicler, plagiarism was no crime and no degradation. He epitomised\r\nor curtailed or adapted the words of his predecessors in the same\r\npath with or without alteration (and usually without acknowledgment),\r\nwhichever best suited his purpose or that of his monastery. He did not\r\nwork for himself but at the command of others, and thus it was that a\r\nmonastery chronicle grew, like a monastery house, at different times,\r\nand by the labour of different hands.”\r\n\r\nOf the heads that planned such chronicles or of the hands that executed\r\nthem, or of the exact proportion contributed by the several writers, no\r\nsatisfactory record has been preserved. The individual is lost in the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier divisions of Wendover’s chronicle, covering the\r\ncenturies from 231 down to about 1000, Wendover certainly relied,\r\nsays Hardy, upon some previous compilation. About the year 1014, that\r\nnarrative, down to the death of Stephen, showed a marked change in\r\nstyle, giving evidence that after this period some other authority had\r\nbeen adopted, while there was also a larger introduction of legendary\r\nmatter. From the accession of Henry II., in 1235, when the _Flores\r\nHistoriarum_ ends, Wendover may be said to assume the character of an\r\noriginal author. On the death of Richard, the work of historiographer\r\nwas taken up by Matthew Paris. His _Lives of the Two Offas_ and his\r\nfamous _Chronicles_ were produced between the years 1236 and 1259.\r\n\r\nIn certain of the more literary of the English monasteries, the divine\r\noffices were moderated in order to allow time for study, and, under the\r\nregulations of some foundations, “lettered” persons were entitled to\r\nspecial exemption from the performance of certain daily services, and\r\nfrom church duty.[145]\r\n\r\nAt a visitation of the treasury of St. Pauls, made in the year 1295,\r\nby Ralph de Baudoke, the Dean (afterwards Bishop of London), there\r\nwere found twelve copies of the Gospels adorned, some with silver,\r\nand others with pearls and gems, and a thirteenth, the case (_capsa_)\r\ncontaining which was decorated not merely with gilding but with\r\nrelics.[146] The treasury also contained a number of other divisions\r\nof the Scriptures, together with a _Commentary_ of Thomas Aquinas.\r\nMaitland says that the use of relics as a decoration was an unusual\r\nfeature. He goes on to point out that the practice of using for\r\nmanuscripts a decorated case, caused the case, not infrequently, to be\r\nmore valuable than the manuscript itself, so that it would be mentioned\r\namong the treasures of the church, when the book contained in it was\r\nnot sufficiently important to be even specified.\r\n\r\nThe binding of the books which were in general use in the English\r\nmonasteries for reference was usually in parchment or in plain leather.\r\nThe use of jewels, gold, or silver for the covers, or for the _capsæ_,\r\nwas, with rare exceptions, limited to the special copies retained in\r\nthe church treasury. William of Malmesbury in the account which he\r\ngives of the chapel made at Glastonbury by King Ina, mentions that\r\ntwenty pounds and sixty marks of gold were used in the preparation of\r\nthe _Coöpertoria Librorum Evangelii_.[147]\r\n\r\n=The Earlier Monastery Schools.=--At the time when neither local nor\r\nnational governments had assumed any responsibilities in connection\r\nwith elementary education, and when the municipalities were too\r\nignorant, and in many cases too poor, to make provision for the\r\neducation of the children, the monks took up the task as a part of the\r\nregular routine of their duty. The Rule of S. Benedict had in fact made\r\nexpress provision for the education of pupils.\r\n\r\nAn exception to the general statement concerning the neglect of the\r\nrulers to make provision for education should, however, be made in the\r\ncase of Charlemagne, whose reign covered the period 790 to 830. It was\r\nthe aim of Charlemagne to correct or at least to lessen the provincial\r\ndifferences and local barbarities of style, expression, pression,\r\northography, etc., in the rendering of Latin, and it was with this end\r\nin view that he planned out his great scheme of an imperial series of\r\nschools, through which should be established an imperial or academic\r\nstandard of style and expression. This appears to have been the first\r\nattempt since the time of the Academy of Alexandria to secure a\r\nscholarly uniformity of the standard throughout the civilised world,\r\nand the school at Tours may be considered as a precursor of the French\r\nAcademy of modern times. For such a scheme the Emperor was dependent\r\nupon the monks, as it was only in the monasteries that could be found\r\nthe scholarship that was required for the work. He entrusted to Alcuin,\r\na scholarly English Benedictine, the task of organising the imperial\r\nschools. The first schools instituted by Alcuin in Aachen and Tours,\r\nand later in Milan, were placed in charge of Benedictine monks, and\r\nformed the models for a long series of monastic schools during the\r\nsucceeding centuries. Alcuin had been trained in the cathedral schools\r\nfounded in York by Egbert, and Egbert had been brought up by Benedict\r\nBiscop in the monastery of Yarrow, where he had for friend and fellow\r\npupil the chronicler Bede. The results of the toilsome journeys taken\r\nby Biscop to collect books for his beloved monasteries of Wearmouth\r\nand Yarrow[148] were far-reaching. The training secured by Alcuin as\r\na scribe and as a student of the Scriptures, the classics, and the\r\n“seven liberal arts” was more immediately due to his master Ælbert, who\r\nafterward succeeded Egbert as archbishop.\r\n\r\nThe script which was accepted as the standard for the imperial schools,\r\nand which, transmitted through successive Benedictine _scriptoria_,\r\nserved seven centuries later as a model for the first type-founders of\r\nItaly and France, can be traced directly to the school at York.\r\n\r\nAlcuin commemorated his school and its master in a descriptive poem\r\n_On the Saints of the Church at York_, which is quoted in full by\r\nWest.[149] In 780, Alcuin succeeded Ælbert as master of the school, and\r\nlater, was placed in charge of the cathedral library, which was at the\r\ntime one of the most important collections in Christendom. In one of\r\nhis poems he gives a kind of metrical summary of the chief contents of\r\nthis library. The lines are worth quoting because of the information\r\npresented as to the authors at that time to be looked for in a really\r\ngreat monastic library. The list includes a distinctive though very\r\nrestricted group of Latin writers, but, as West points out, the works\r\n“by glorious Greece transferred to Rome” form but a meagre group.\r\nThe catalogue omits Isidore, although previous references make clear\r\nthat the writings of the great Spanish bishop were important works of\r\nreference in York as in all the British schools. It is West’s opinion\r\nthat the _Aristotle_ and other Greek authors referred to were probably\r\npresent only in Latin versions. These manuscripts in the York library\r\nwere undoubtedly for the most part transcripts of the parchments\r\ncollected for Wearmouth and Yarrow by Biscop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Library of York Cathedral._\r\n\r\n  There shalt thou find the volumes that contain\r\n  All of the ancient Fathers who remain;\r\n  There all the Latin writers make their home\r\n  With those that glorious Greece transferred to Rome,\r\n  The Hebrews draw from their celestial stream,\r\n  And Africa is bright with learning’s beam.\r\n\r\n  Here shines what Jerome, Ambrose, Hilary thought,\r\n  Or Athanasius and Augustine wrought.\r\n  Orosius, Leo, Gregory the Great,\r\n  Near Basil and Fulgentius coruscate.\r\n\r\n  Grave Cassiodorus and John Chrysostom\r\n  Next Master Bede and learned Aldhelm come,\r\n  While Victorinus and Boëthius stand\r\n  With Pliny and Pompeius close at hand.\r\n\r\n  Wise Aristotle looks on Tully near,\r\n  Sedulius and Juvencus next appear.\r\n  Then come Albinus, Clement, Prosper too,\r\n  Paulinus and Arator. Next we view\r\n  Lactantius, Fortunatus. Ranged in line\r\n  Virgilius Maro, Statius, Lucan, shine.\r\n\r\n  Donatus, Priscian, Phobus, Phocas, start\r\n  The roll of masters in grammatic art.\r\n  Entychius, Servius, Pompey, each extend\r\n  The list. Comminian brings it to an end.\r\n\r\n  There shalt thou find, O reader, many more\r\n  Famed for their style, the masters of old lore,\r\n  Whose many volumes singly to rehearse\r\n  Were far too tedious for our present verse.[150]\r\n\r\nAlcuin’s work on the Continent began in 782, when, resigning his\r\nplace as master of the cathedral school in York, he took charge of\r\nthe imperial or palace school at Tours. His work in the palace school\r\nincluded not only the organisation of classes for the younger students,\r\nbut the personal charge of a class which comprised the Emperor\r\nhimself, his wife Luitgard, and other members of the royal or imperial\r\nfamily. Whether for the younger or for the older students, however,\r\nthe instruction given had to be of a very elementary character. The\r\ndistinctive value of the work was, it is to be borne in mind, not in\r\nthe extent of the instruction given to the immediate pupils, but in\r\nmaking clear to the Emperor and to his sons who were to succeed him,\r\nthe importance of securing a certain uniformity of script and of\r\neducational work throughout the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that not a few of the earlier copyists who\r\ncompleted in the _scriptoria_ the tasks set for them by the instructors\r\ntrained in Tours and in Aachen, transcribed texts the purport of which\r\nthey had not mastered. It was through their work, however, that the\r\ntexts themselves were preserved and were made available for later\r\nscribes and students who were competent to comprehend the spirit as\r\nwell as the letter of their contents.\r\n\r\nMabillon is in accord with later authorities such as Compayré and West,\r\nas to the deplorable condition of learning at this time throughout\r\nthe Empire ruled by Charles. Says West: “The plight of learning in\r\nFrankland at this time was deplorable. Whatever traditions had found\r\ntheir way from the early Gallic schools into the education of the\r\nFranks had long since been scattered and obliterated in the wild\r\ndisorders which characterised the times of the Merovingian kings....\r\nThe copying of books had almost ceased, and all that can be found that\r\npretends to the name of literature in this time is the dull chronicle\r\nor ignorantly conceived legend.”[151]\r\n\r\nA description such as this emphasises the importance of the work\r\ninitiated by Alcuin, work the value of which the ruler of Europe was\r\nfortunately able to appreciate and ready to support. In his relation to\r\nscholarly interests in Europe and to the preservation of the literature\r\nof the past, Alcuin may fairly be considered as the successor of\r\nCassiodorus. He was able in the eighth century to render a service\r\nhardly less distinctive than that credited to Cassiodorus three hundred\r\nyears earlier. There is the further parallel that, like Cassiodorus,\r\nhe possessed a very keen and intelligent interest in the form given to\r\nliterary expression, and in all the details of the work given to the\r\ncopyists. The instructions given in Alcuin’s treatise on orthography\r\nfor the work of the scribes, follow very closely in principle, and\r\ndiffer, in fact, but slightly in detail from, the instructions given by\r\nCassiodorus in his own treatise on the same subject. A couplet which\r\nstands at the head of the first page reads as follows: “Let him who\r\nwould publish the sayings of the ancients read me, for he who follows\r\nme not will speak without regard to law.”[152] Alcuin’s care in regard\r\nto the consistency of punctuation and orthography and his intelligent\r\nselection of a clearer and neater form of script than had heretofore\r\nbeen employed, have impressed a special character on the series of\r\nmanuscripts dating from the early portion of the ninth century and\r\nwritten in what is termed the Caroline minuscule. In a letter written\r\nto Charles from Tours in 799, Alcuin mentions that he has copied out on\r\nsome blank parchment which the King had sent him a short treatise on\r\ncorrect diction, with illustrations from Bede. He goes on to speak of\r\nthe special value to literature of the distinctions and subdistinctions\r\nof punctuation, the knowledge of which has, he complains, almost\r\ndisappeared: “But even as the glory of all learning and the ornaments\r\nof wholesome erudition begin to be seen again by reason of your noble\r\nexertions, so also it seems most fitting that the use of punctuation\r\nshould also be resumed by scribes.... Let your authority so instruct\r\nthe youths at the palace that they may be able to utter with perfect\r\nelegance whatsoever the clear eloquence of your thought may dictate,\r\nso that whatsoever may go to the parchment bearing the royal name it\r\nmay display the excellence of the royal learning.”[153] A very delicate\r\nhint, remarks West, for Charles to mind his commas and his colons.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Charlemagne there appears to have been so little\r\nfacility in writing and so few scribes were available, that government\r\nrecords were not kept even at the Courts. The schools established\r\nby Alcuin at Tours, under the direction of Charlemagne, were in fact\r\nthe first schools for writers which had existed in Western Europe\r\nfor centuries. One of the earlier applications made of the knowledge\r\ngained in the imperial schools was for the critical analysis of certain\r\nhistorical documents which had heretofore been accepted as final\r\nauthorities. In the earlier centuries of the Middle Ages, anything that\r\nwas in writing appears to have been accepted as necessarily trustworthy\r\nand valuable, very much as in the earlier times of printing the fact\r\nthat a statement was in print caused it to be accepted as something\r\nnot to be contradicted. The critical faculty, combined with the\r\nscholarly knowledge necessary and properly applied, was, however, of\r\nslow growth, and centuries must still have passed before, in this work\r\nof differentiating the value of documents, the authority of scholars\r\nsecured its full recognition.\r\n\r\nAfter this work of Alcuin began, that is to say, after the beginning\r\nof the ninth century, it became the rule of each properly organised\r\nmonastery to include, in addition to the _scriptorium_, an _armarium_,\r\nor writing-chamber, which was utilised as a class-room for instruction\r\nin writing and in Latin. In a letter of Canonicus Geoffrey, of\r\nSt.-Barbe-en-Auge, dated 1170, occurs the expression, _Claustrum sine\r\narmario est quasi castrum sine armamentario_,[154] (a monastery without\r\na writing-chamber is like a camp without a storehouse of munitions or\r\nan armory.)\r\n\r\nThe Capitular of Charlemagne, issued in the year 789, addressed itself\r\nto the correction of the ignorance and carelessness of the monks, and\r\nto the necessity of preserving a standard of correctness for the work\r\nof transcribing holy writings. It contains the phrase:\r\n\r\n_Et pueros vestros non sinite eos vel legendo vel scribendo corrumpere.\r\nEt si opus est evangelium, psalterium et missale scribere, perfectæ\r\nætatis homines scribant cum omni diligentia._\r\n\r\n(Do not permit your pupils, either in reading or writing, to garble the\r\ntext;--and when you are preparing copies of the gospel, the psalter,\r\nor the missal, see that the work is confided to men of mature age, who\r\nwill write with due care.)\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written by Alcuin as an injunction to pious\r\nscribes:\r\n\r\nAD MUSÆUM LIBROS SCRIBENTIUM.\r\n\r\n  _Hic sedeant sacræ scribentes famina legis,\r\n  Nec non sanctorum dicta sacrata patrum.\r\n  His interserere caveant sua frivola verbis,\r\n  Frivola ne propter erret et ipsa manus,\r\n  Correctosque sibi quærant studiose libellos,\r\n  Tramite quo recto penna volantis eat.\r\n  Per cola distinguant proprios et commata sensus.\r\n  Et punctos ponant ordine quosque suo,\r\n  Ne vel falsa legat taceat vel forte repente,\r\n  Ante pios fratres lector in ecclesia._\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  (Quoted from the Vienna Codex, 743. Denis, i., 313.)\r\n\r\nWattenbach is of opinion that these lines stood over the door of the\r\n_scriptorium_ of S. Martin’s Monastery.\r\n\r\nWest says that the lines were written as an injunction to the scribes\r\nof the school at Tours. He gives the following version, which takes in\r\ncertain further lines of the original than those cited by Wattenbach:\r\n\r\n“Here let the scribes sit who copy out the words of the Divine Law, and\r\nlikewise the hallowed sayings of the holy Fathers. Let them beware of\r\ninterspersing their own frivolities in the words they copy, nor let a\r\ntrifler’s hand make mistakes through haste. Let them earnestly seek out\r\nfor themselves correctly written books to transcribe, that the flying\r\npen may speed along the right path. Let them distinguish the proper\r\nsense by colons and commas, and let them set the points each one in\r\nits due place, and let not him who reads the words to them either read\r\nfalsely or pause suddenly. It is a noble work to write out holy books,\r\nnor shall the scribe fail of his due reward. Writing books is better\r\nthan planting vines, for he who plants a vine serves his belly, but he\r\nwho writes a book serves his soul.”[155]\r\n\r\nIn a manuscript which was written in S. Jacob’s Monastery in Liége,\r\noccurred the following lines:\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Rebeccæ dilexit simplicitatem,\r\n  Altus mens Jacobi scribendi sedulitatem.\r\n  Ille pecus pascens se divitiis cumulavit,\r\n  Iste libros scribens meritum sibi multiplicavit.\r\n  Ille Rachel typicam præ cunctis duxit amatam,\r\n  Hic habeat vitam justis super astra paratam._[156]\r\n\r\n  [(The Hebrew) Jacob loved the simplicity of Rebecca,\r\n  The lofty soul of (the monk) Jacob (loved) the work of the scribe.\r\n  The former accumulated riches in pasturing his flocks,\r\n  The latter increased his fame through the writing of books.\r\n  The former won his Rachel, loved beyond all others.\r\n  May the scribe have the eternal life which is prepared above the\r\n    stars for the just.]\r\n\r\nThe most important of the works of Alcuin that can be called original\r\nwere his educational writings, comprising treatises _On Grammar_,\r\n_On Orthography_, _On Rhetoric and the Virtues_, _On Dialectics_, _A\r\nDisputation with Pepin_, and a study of astronomy entitled _De Cursu et\r\nSaltu Lunæ ac Bissexto_. West mentions three other treatises which have\r\nbeen ascribed to him: _On the Seven Arts_, _A Disputation for Boys_,\r\nand the _Propositions of Alcuin_.[157] Alcuin was more fortunate than\r\nhis great predecessor Cassiodorus in respect to the preservation of\r\nhis writings. Manuscripts of all of these remained in existence until\r\nthe time came when the complete set of works could be issued in printed\r\nform, and the work of the old instructor could be appreciated by a\r\ngeneration living a thousand years after his life had closed. He died\r\nat Tours in 804, in his seventieth year. Mabillon speaks of Alcuin as\r\n“the most learned man of his age.” Laurie is disposed to lay stress\r\nupon the monastic limitations of his intellect, and thinks that his\r\nprincipal ability was that of an administrator; West emphasises the\r\n“pure unselfishness of his character,” and adds, with discriminating\r\nappreciation: “We must also credit him with a certain largeness of\r\nview, in spite of his circumscribed horizon. He had some notion of the\r\ncontinuity of the intellectual life of man, of the perils that beset\r\nthe transmission of learning from age to age, and of the disgrace which\r\nattached to those who would allow those noble arts to perish which the\r\nwisest of men among the ancients had discovered.... Perceiving that\r\nthe precious treasure of knowledge was then hidden in a few books,\r\nhe made it his care to transmit to future ages copies undisfigured\r\nby slips of the pen or mistakes of the understanding. Thus in every\r\nway that lay within his power, he endeavoured to put the fortunes\r\nof learning for the times that should succeed him in a position of\r\nadvantage, safeguarded by an abundance of truthfully transcribed\r\nbooks, interpreted by teachers of his own training, sheltered within\r\nthe Church and defended by the civil power.”[158] Professor West’s\r\nappreciative summary does full justice to the work and the ideals\r\nof Charlemagne’s great schoolmaster. I should only add that in the\r\nspecial service he was in a position to render in the preservation,\r\ntransmission, and publication of the world’s literature, Alcuin must\r\nbe accorded a very high place in the series of literary workers which,\r\nbeginning with Cassiodorus, includes such names as Columba, Biscop,\r\nAurispa, Gutenberg, Aldus, Estienne, and Froben.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy of the successors of Alcuin in the palace school\r\nat Tours was John Scotus Erigena, who in 845 was appointed master by\r\nCharles the Bold. The influence of the Irish monk widened the range of\r\nstudy and gave to it an active-minded and speculative tendency that\r\nbrought about a wide departure from the settled conservatism which had\r\nalways characterised the teaching of Alcuin. The list of books given to\r\nthe scribe for copying was increased, and now included, for instance,\r\nworks of such doubtful orthodoxy as the _Satyricon_ of Martianus\r\nCapella, a voluminous compilation constituting a kind of cyclopædia of\r\nthe seven liberal arts. Its composition dates from about 500.[159]\r\n\r\nIn a treatise, _De Instituto Clericorum_, written in 819 (that is,\r\nduring the reign of Louis I.), by Rabanus Maurus, who was Abbot\r\nof Fulda and later, Archbishop of Mayence, is cited the following\r\nregulation: “The canons and the decrees of Pope Zosimus have decided\r\nthat a clerk proceeding to holy orders shall continue five years\r\namong the readers ... and after that shall for four years serve as an\r\nacolyte or sub-deacon.” (The Zosimus referred to was Pope for but one\r\nyear, 417-418.) Rabanus had just before remarked, “_Lectores_ are so\r\ncalled _a legendo_.” He goes on to say that “he who would rightly and\r\nproperly perform the duty of a reader must be imbued with learning and\r\nconversant with books, and must further be instructed in the meaning\r\nof words and in the knowledge of the words themselves,” etc.[160]\r\nRabanus follows this with a series of very practical instructions and\r\nsuggestions for effective education on the part of the readers. These\r\nwere based upon the treatise on elocution written nearly two hundred\r\nyears earlier by the learned Bishop Isidore of Seville, and they were\r\nagain copied three years after the time of Rabanus by Ibo, Bishop of\r\nChartres, in the treatise _De Rebus Ecclesiasticis_. Maitland, to whom\r\nI am indebted for this citation, finds cause for indignant criticism of\r\nthe historian Robertson for the superficial and misleading references\r\nmade by the historian to the dense ignorance of the Church in the\r\nMiddle Ages. Maitland suggests that if Robertson had applied for\r\nholy orders to the Archbishop of Seville in the seventh century, the\r\nArchbishop of Mayence in the ninth, or the Bishop of Chartres in the\r\neleventh, he would have found the examination rather more of a task\r\nthan he expected. West speaks of Rabanus as “Alcuin’s greatest pupil,”\r\nand as intellectually “a greater man than his master.”[161] He wrote a\r\nlong series of theological and educational treatises.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Constitutions_ of Reculfus, who became Bishop of Soissons in\r\n879, it is evident that he expected the clergy to be able both to read\r\nand to write. The Bishop says: “We admonish that each one of you should\r\nbe careful to have a Missal, a Lectionary, a Book of the Gospels,\r\na Martyrology, an Antiphonary, a Psalter, and a copy of the Forty\r\nHomilies of S. Gregory, corrected and pointed by our copies which we\r\nuse in the holy mother Church; and also fail not to have as many sacred\r\nand ecclesiastical books as you can get, for from these you shall\r\nreceive food and condiment for your souls.... If, however, any one of\r\nyou is not able to obtain all the books of the Old Testament, at least\r\nlet him diligently take pains to transcribe for himself correctly the\r\nfirst book of the whole sacred history, that is, _Genesis_, by reading\r\nwhich he may come to understand the creation of the world.”[162] The\r\ncounsel was good, even although a perfectly clear understanding of the\r\ncreation might after all not have been secured.\r\n\r\nBy the close of the ninth century, a large proportion of the\r\nmonasteries of the Continent and of England carried on schools which\r\nwere open to the children of as large a district as could be reached.\r\nIn many cases, the elementary classes were succeeded by classes in\r\nadvanced instruction, while from these were selected favourites or\r\nexceptionally capable pupils, who enjoyed in still higher studies the\r\nadvantage of the guidance and service of the best scholars in the\r\nmonastery. West, in summing up the later influence of Alcuin, speaks\r\nof the stream of learning as having flowed from York to Tours and\r\nfrom Tours (through Rabanus) to Fulda, thence to Auxerre, Ferrières,\r\nCorbies (old and new), Reichenau, St. Gall, and Rheims, one branch of\r\nit finally reaching Paris.[163] Mabillon speaks of the abbey schools of\r\nFleury as containing during the tenth and eleventh centuries as many as\r\nfive thousand scholars.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the most important schools were those instituted at Monte\r\nCassino, Pomposa, and Classe. Giesebrecht is, however, of opinion that\r\nthe educational work of the Italian monasteries was less important than\r\nthat carried on by the monasteries in Germany, France, or England. In\r\nGermany, the monasteries which have already been mentioned as centres\r\nof intellectual activity were also those which had instituted the most\r\nimportant and effective of the schools, the list including St. Gall,\r\nFulda, Reichenau, Hirschau, Wissembourg, Hersfeld, and many others.\r\n\r\nIn France and Belgium, the names of the conspicuous abbey schools\r\ninclude those of Marmoutier, Fontenelle, Fleury, Corbie, Ferrières,\r\nBec, Clugni. In England, the most noteworthy of the abbey schools\r\nwere St. Albans, Glastonbury, Malmesbury, Croyland, and S. Peter’s\r\nof Canterbury. From the epoch of Charlemagne to that of S. Louis,\r\nthe great abbeys of Christian Europe served in fact not only as its\r\nschools but as its universities. The more intelligent of the nobility\r\nand the kings themselves were interested in securing for their children\r\nthe educational advantages of the monastery schools. Among the French\r\nkings who were brought up in this way are to be named Pepin the Little,\r\nRobert the Pious, and Louis the Fat. In Spain, Sancho the Great, King\r\nof Navarre and of Castile, was a graduate of the monastery of Leyre.\r\n\r\nIn England, we have the noteworthy example of Alfred, who was not\r\nashamed, after having reached mature years, to repair his imperfect\r\neducation by attending the school established in Oxford by the\r\nBenedictines, where he is said to have studied grammar, philosophy,\r\nrhetoric, history, music, and versification.[164]\r\n\r\nA large number of the convents, following the example of the abbeys,\r\ncontained schools in which were trained not only the future novices,\r\nbut also numbers of young girls destined for the life of the Courts or\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nMabillon finds occasion to correct the impression on the part of\r\nsome writers of the sixteenth century, that the monasteries had been\r\nestablished solely for the purpose of carrying on educational work.\r\nHe writes: _C’est une illusion de certains gens qui ont écrit dans le\r\nsiècle précédent que les monastères n’avaient esté d’abord établis que\r\npour servir d’écoles faisantes profession d’enseigner les sciences\r\nhumaines_.\r\n\r\nDe Rancé, who wrote a _Traité de la saincteté et du devoir de la\r\nvie monastique_, took the ground that the pursuit of literature was\r\ninconsistent with the monastic profession, and that the reading of\r\nthe monks ought to be confined to the Scriptures and a few books\r\nof devotion. The treatise was understood to be an attack upon the\r\nBenedictine monks of St. Maur, for that they were learned was a matter\r\nof general knowledge, and the monks of La Trappe, the Order with\r\nwhich De Rancé had associated himself, had an old-time antagonism to\r\ntheir scholarly neighbours. It may be considered as a good service for\r\nliterature and for monastic history that the treatise of De Rancé,\r\nnarrow and unimportant in itself as it was, should have been published.\r\nNine years later, in the year 1691, was issued the reply of the\r\nBenedictines, the learned and valuable _Traité des Études Monastiques_\r\nof Dom Mabillon, which will be referred to more particularly in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\nThe historians of these monastic schools have laid stress upon the\r\nlimited conceptions possessed by their founders and by the instructors,\r\nof the purpose and possibilities of education, conceptions which of\r\nnecessity affected not only the work done in the school-room, but the\r\ncharacter of the literature produced in the _scriptoria_. Laurie, for\r\ninstance, writes as follows: “The Christian conception of education\r\nwas, unfortunately (like that of old Cato), narrow. It tended steadily\r\nto concentrate and to contract men’s intellectual interests. The\r\nChristian did not think of the culture of the whole man. He could not\r\nconsistently do so. His whole purpose was the salvation of the soul....\r\nSalvation was to be obtained through abnegation of the world and\r\nthrough faith.... Christianity, accordingly, found itself necessarily\r\nplaced in mortal antagonism to ‘Humanitas’ and to Hellenism, and had\r\nto go through the troublous experiences of nearly 1400 years before\r\nthe possibility of the union of reason with authority, of religion\r\nwith Hellenism, could be conserved.... As was indeed inevitable,\r\ntheological discussion more and more occupied the active intellect of\r\nthe time, to the subordination, if not total neglect of humane letters\r\nand philosophy. The Latin and Greek classics were ultimately denounced.\r\nAs the offspring of the pagan world, if not indeed inspired by demons,\r\nthey were dangerous to the faith.”[165]\r\n\r\nFrom the _Apostolic Constitutions_, ascribed to the middle of the\r\nfourth century, Mr. Bass Mullinger quotes the injunction: “Refrain from\r\nall the writings of the heathen: for what hast thou to do with strange\r\ndiscourses, laws, or false prophets, which, in truth, turn aside from\r\nthe faith those who are weak in the understanding ... wherefore abstain\r\nscrupulously from all strange and devilish books.”[166]\r\n\r\nIt was S. Augustine who said _Indocti cœlum rapiunt_--“It is the\r\nignorant who take the kingdom of heaven,”--and Gregory the Great who\r\nasserted that he would blush to have Holy Scripture subjected to the\r\nrules of grammar.[167] West speaks of the conceptions of grammar and of\r\nrhetoric taught by Alcuin as “crude” and “puerile,” and of his theories\r\nof language as “childish.”\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a truism to point out that the educational work done\r\nby Alcuin and the other great instructors of the monastic schools\r\nis not to be judged by the standard of later ages. The students for\r\nwhose training they were responsible, whether children or adults,\r\nprinces or peasants, must have been, with hardly an exception, in a\r\nvery elementary condition of mental development, and it was necessary\r\nfor the instruction to be in like manner elementary. In this study, I\r\nam, however, not undertaking to consider the history of education in\r\nearly Europe, a subject which has been so ably presented in the works\r\nof Mullinger, Laurie, Compayré, and West. I am concerned with the\r\nwork of these early schoolmasters simply because to their persistent\r\nefforts was due the preservation of literature in Europe. If Alcuin and\r\nhis successors had done nothing else than to secure a substantially\r\nuniform system of writing throughout the great schools in which were\r\ntrained abbots and scribes for hundreds of monasteries, they would\r\nhave conferred an inestimable service upon Europe. But their work did\r\ngo much further. Notwithstanding the various injunctions and warnings\r\nof ecclesiastical leaders against “pagan” literature, it proved\r\nimpracticable to prevent this literature from being preserved and\r\nmanifolded in numberless _scriptoria_. The record of the opposition\r\nhas been preserved in a series of edicts and injunctions. But the fact\r\nthat the interest in the writings of the ancients proved strong enough\r\nto withstand all the fulminations and censures is evidenced by the\r\nlong series of manuscripts of the classics produced in the monasteries\r\nduring the tenth and eleventh centuries. The writers of these\r\nmanuscripts were the product of the schools instituted by Charlemagne\r\nand Alcuin.\r\n\r\n=The Benedictines of the Continent.=--The two writers who have given\r\nthe largest attention to the record of the literary and scholarly\r\nwork of the Benedictines during the seven centuries between 500 and\r\n1200 A.D., are Mabillon and Ziegelbauer. Dom Mabillon was himself a\r\nBenedictine monk and had a full inheritance of the literary spirit and\r\nscholarly devotion which characterised the Order. He was born in Rheims\r\nin 1632, and his treatise on monastic studies, _Traité des Études\r\nMonastiques_, which has remained the chief authority on its subject,\r\nwas published in Paris in 1691. Ziegelbauer’s _Observationes Literariæ\r\nS. Benedicti_ appeared a century later.[168]\r\n\r\nMabillon’s work forms a magnificent monument not only to the learning,\r\ndiligence, and literary skill of its writer, but to the enormous value\r\nof the services rendered, during a number of centuries, by the monks\r\nof his Order, in the preservation of literature from the ravages of\r\nbarbarism and in the development of scholarship. Mabillon also makes\r\nclear the lasting importance of the original initiative given to the\r\nliterary labour of the Benedictines by the Rule of their founder.\r\nAn important portion of the material upon which Mabillon’s treatise\r\nwas based, was collected during a series of journeys made by him in\r\ncompany with his brother under the instructions first of the great\r\nminister Colbert, and later, of Le Tellier, Archbishop of Rheims, for\r\nthe purpose of examining or of searching for documents relating to the\r\nroyal family and of procuring books for the royal library. The first\r\nof these journeys, undertaken in the year 1682, was completed entirely\r\nwithin French territory and was entitled _Iter Burgundicum_. The second\r\ncovered a considerable portion of South Germany and Switzerland, and\r\nis known as the _Iter Germanicum_. The third was devoted to Italy,\r\nand is described under the title of _Iter Italicum_; while the fourth\r\ninvestigation was made in Alsace and Lorraine, and the record is\r\nentitled _Iter Literarium in Alsatiam et Lotharingiam_.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the journeys involved a thorough ransacking of as many\r\nlibraries as they could secure admission to, the libraries being, with\r\nbut few exceptions, contained in the monasteries. The immediate result\r\nof these journeys was the addition to the royal library of some three\r\nthousand volumes, chiefly collected in Italy, and the later result,\r\nthe publication of the records above specified, which form a most\r\nvaluable presentation of the condition of the monastic collections\r\nin the seventeenth century, and which give in their lists the titles\r\nof a considerable number of valuable works which have since entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA century later than S. Benedict, an unknown hermit called “the\r\nMaster” prepared a Rule under which monks were required to study until\r\nthey reached the age of fifty.[169] The Rule of S. Aurelian and S.\r\nFerreol rendered this regulation universal, and that of Grimlaïcus\r\nidentified the character of the hermit with that of “doctor.”[170] In\r\nall countries where the Benedictine Orders flourished, literature and\r\nscholarship exercised an abiding influence. It is impossible, contends\r\nMontalembert, to name an abbey famed for the number and holiness of\r\nits monks which is not also noted for learning and for its school of\r\nliterature. The Benedictine monks during the four or five centuries\r\nafter the foundation of the Order certainly appear to have held\r\nthemselves faithful to the precept of S. Jerome, “A book always in\r\nyour hand or under your eyes.” (_Nunquam de manu necque oculis recedat\r\nliber._[171]) They also accepted very generally the example of Bede,\r\nwho said that it had been for him always delightful either to learn, to\r\nteach, or to write.[172] Warton is authority for the statement that in\r\nthe year 790 Charlemagne granted to the abbot and monks of Sithiu an\r\nunlimited right of hunting, in order that they might procure from the\r\nskins of the deer killed, gloves, girdles, and covers for their books.\r\nHe goes on to say: “We may imagine that these religious were more fond\r\nof hunting than of reading. It is certain that they were obliged to\r\nhunt before they could read, and it seems probable that under these\r\ncircumstances they did not manufacture many volumes.”[173] Maitland, in\r\nreferring to the original text of the concession, finds, however, that\r\nthis has been misread by Warton. The permission to hunt, for the useful\r\npurpose specified, was given not for the monks but for the servants of\r\nthe monastery.\r\n\r\nWith all the great Benedictine monasteries, it was the routine to\r\ninstitute first a library, then a _scriptorium_ for the manifolding\r\nof books, and finally schools, open, not only to students who were\r\npreparing for the Church, but to all in the neighbourhood who had need\r\nof or desire for instruction. The copies prepared in the _scriptorium_\r\nof the texts from the library were utilised in the first place for the\r\nduplicates needed of the works in most frequent reference, but more\r\nparticularly for securing by exchange copies of texts not already in\r\nthe library, and, in many instances, also for adding either to the\r\ndirect wealth of the monastery (by exchange for lands or cattle) or to\r\nits income by making sale of the works through travelling monks or by\r\ncorrespondence with other monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe list of monasteries which became in this manner literary and\r\npublishing centres would include nearly all the great Benedictine\r\nfoundations of both Britain and the Continent. There was probably,\r\nhowever, a greater activity during the period between 600 and 1200,\r\nin the matter at least of collecting and circulating books, in the\r\nmonasteries of France than in those of Italy, Germany, or Britain; but\r\nmore important even than Clugni, Marmoutier, or Corbie, in France, was\r\nthe great Swiss abbey of St. Gall, an abbey the realm of which reached\r\nalmost to the proportions of a small municipality. In the shade of\r\nits walls, there dwelt a whole nation, divided into two branches, the\r\n_familia intus_, which comprised the labourers, shepherds, and workmen\r\nof all trades, and the _familia foris_, composed of serfs, who were\r\nbound to do three days’ work in each week.\r\n\r\nWithin the monastery itself, there were, in the latter half of the\r\ntenth century, no less than five hundred monks, together with a great\r\ngroup of students. In Germany, the most noted of what might be called\r\nthe literary monasteries during the ninth and tenth centuries were\r\nthose of Fulda, Reichenau, Lorsch, Hirschau, and Gandersheim. It was\r\nin the latter that the nun Hroswitha composed her famous dramas. In\r\nFrance, in addition to those already specified, should be mentioned\r\nFleury, St. Remy, St. Denis, Luxeuil, S. Vincent at Toul, and Aurillac.\r\nIn Belgium, S. Peter’s at Ghent was, during the tenth century, the most\r\nimportant of the scholarly monasteries. In England, in addition to the\r\nearlier foundations, already referred to, of Wearmouth and Yarrow, St.\r\nAlbans and Glastonbury became the most famous. Before the eleventh\r\ncentury, the literature that came into existence from contemporary\r\nwriters or reproductions of the works of classic writers outside of\r\nthe monasteries must have been very trifling indeed. One of the most\r\nnoteworthy publications which emanated from St. Gall was the great\r\ndictionary or _Vocabulary_ bearing the name of Solomon (Abbot of St.\r\nGall and later, Bishop of Constance), a work which was in fact a kind\r\nof literary and scientific encyclopædia. This manuscript, comprising in\r\nall 1070 pages, was put into print in the latter part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.[174] The records of the famous library of the monastery have\r\nbeen brought together by later scholars, and it is their testimony\r\nthat the manuscripts contained in it were among the most beautiful and\r\naccurate specimens of caligraphy known. These St. Gall manuscripts\r\nwere also noted for their exquisite miniatures and illuminations.\r\nThe parchment used for them was prepared by the hands of the monks,\r\nand they also did their own binding.[175] The fame of Sintram, one\r\nof the most noteworthy of the copyists, was known throughout all the\r\ncountries north of the Alps; _Omnis orbis cisalpinus Sintramni digitos\r\nmiratur_.[176]\r\n\r\nIn the two schools attached to St. Gall, lectures were given, in the\r\nlatter half of the tenth century, on Cicero, Quintilian, Horace,\r\nTerence, Juvenal, Persius, Ovid, and Sophocles.[177] There was even\r\nsaid to be among the monks of St. Gall a society established for the\r\nstudy of Greek, called the Hellenic Brothers.[178] The Duchess Hedwig\r\nof Suabia herself taught Greek to Abbot Burckhart II. when he was a\r\nchild, and rewarded him by the gift of a “Horace” for his readiness\r\nin verse-making. The Abbot later described in verse the embarrassment\r\ncaused to him by a kiss with which the learned Duchess had favoured\r\nhim.[179] The Duchess had, when a young woman, learned Latin from\r\nthe Ekkehart who, later, became Dean of St. Gall (Ekkehart I.), in\r\npartnership with whom she wrote a commentary on Virgil. A very\r\ncharming account of the tuition of this fascinating young Duchess is\r\ngiven in Scheffel’s famous romance called _Der Treue Ekkehart_. Arx\r\nstates that Ekkehart III. and IV. and Notker Labeo were familiar with\r\nHomer, Plato, and Aristotle, and made from them Greek verses.[180]\r\n\r\nThere is every evidence to indicate that there was during the tenth\r\ncentury a knowledge of Greek in certain monastery centres of South\r\nEurope, which knowledge, two centuries later, had disappeared almost\r\nentirely, so that the re-introduction into Italy of the writings\r\nof Greek poets and philosophers in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies came as a fresh revelation. Mabillon contended that while\r\nthe monks made Holy Scripture the basis for their theological studies,\r\nit is certain that they acquired apart from these studies, a mass of\r\nother knowledge, and notably all that they could gather with regard\r\nto physical science. Thence it arose that in mediæval works the term\r\n_scripturæ_, or even _scripturæ sacræ_, does not always mean the Holy\r\nScriptures, but stands for all books which treat of Christian or\r\necclesiastical truths or which are useful aids in understanding the\r\nWord of God.[181] Montalembert, commenting on this passage, goes on to\r\nsay that to the monk of the tenth century no knowledge was unfamiliar.\r\nPhilosophy in its scholastic form, grammar and versification,\r\nmusic, botany, mechanics, astronomy, geometry in its most practical\r\napplication, all of these were the objects of their research and of\r\ntheir writings. The curious poem addressed by the monk Alfano to\r\nTheodoric, son of the Count Marses and at the time a novice at Monte\r\nCassino, is cited in support of this view. The poem presents a detailed\r\naccount of the daily occupations in the great monastery, in which\r\noccupations literary work holds a very large place. It also gives a\r\nsummary of the scholastic pursuits carried on in the monastery.[182]\r\n\r\nA service possibly even greater than that of the preservation of\r\nliterature and of the keeping alive of an intellectual spirit, was\r\nrendered by the monks in the great educational work carried on by them.\r\nIn the Monasterium Resbacense, in Brieggan, founded by Bishop Andœnus\r\nin 634, whose first abbot, S. Ægilius, was a pupil of S. Columban’s,\r\nthe list of books in the _scriptorium_ included Cicero, Virgil, Horace,\r\nTerence, Donatus, Priscian, and Boëthius. Of later authors, the works\r\nof Beda, Isidore, Aldhelm, the _Gesta Francorum_, etc.[183] By the\r\ntime of Charles Martel and the battle of Poitiers, there had been\r\nmuch plundering and devastation of the monasteries and convents, the\r\neffects of which remained even after the Arabs were driven back. During\r\nthe tumultuous reigns of the Pepins, many clerics returned to or took\r\nup the profession of arms, and devotion and literature were alike\r\nneglected.[184] The biographer of S. Eligius, writing in 760 (under\r\nPepin) says:[185]\r\n\r\n“What do we want with the so-called philosophies of Pythagoras,\r\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle, or with the rubbish and nonsense of\r\nsuch shameless poets as Homer, Virgil, and Menander? What service can\r\nbe rendered to the servants of God by the writings of the heathen\r\nSallust, Herodotus, Livy, Demosthenes, or Cicero?” Fredegar, called\r\n_Scholasticus_, wrote his chronicle in a Burgundian monastery, about\r\n600. He complains that “the world is in its decrepitude. Intellectual\r\nactivity is dead, and the ancient writers have no successors.”\r\n\r\nThe man to whom the revival of the literary interests of the northern\r\nmonasteries was largely due was the Archbishop Chrodegang of Metz,\r\n742-766, Chancellor of Charles Martel, a Benedictine. He framed rules\r\nfor the monasteries which restored discipline and infused new life.\r\nHis code was adopted throughout France, Italy, and Germany, and even in\r\nEngland. A certain uniformity of instruction was thus secured in the\r\nmonastery schools in singing, language, and script, which persisted\r\nalmost until the time of Alcuin, and the influence of which extended\r\neven beyond the monasteries.\r\n\r\nMabillon tells a story of Odo, Abbot of Clugni (who died about 942),\r\nwho was so seduced by the love of knowledge that he was led to employ\r\nhimself with the vanities of the poets, and resolved to read the works\r\nof Virgil regularly through. On the following night, however, he saw in\r\na dream a large vase of marvellous beauty, but filled with innumerable\r\nserpents, which, springing forth, twined about him, but without doing\r\nhim any injury. The holy man, waking and prudently considering the\r\nvision, took the serpents to stand for the figments of the poets, and\r\nthe vase to represent Virgil’s book, which was painted outwardly with\r\nworldly eloquence, but was internally defiled with the vanity of impure\r\nmeaning. From thenceforward, renouncing Virgil and his pomps, and\r\nkeeping the poets out of his chamber, he sought his mental nourishment\r\nsolely from the sacred writings.[186]\r\n\r\nHonorius, the reputed author of the _Gemma Animæ_, writes in 1120: “It\r\ngrieves me when I consider in my mind the number of persons who, having\r\nlost their senses, are not ashamed to give their utmost labour to the\r\ninvestigation of the abominable figments of the poets, and the captious\r\narguments of the philosophers, which are wont inextricably to bind\r\nthe mind that is drawn away from God in the bonds of vices and to be\r\nignorant of the Christian profession whereby the soul may come to reign\r\neverlastingly with God; as it is the height of madness to be anxious to\r\nlearn the laws of an usurper and to be ignorant of the edicts of the\r\nlawful sovereign. Moreover, how is the soul profited by the strife of\r\nHector, or the argumentation of Plato, or the poems of Virgil, or the\r\nelegies of Ovid, who now, with their like, are gnashing their teeth\r\nin the prison of the infernal Babylon, under the cruel tyranny of\r\nPluto.”[187]\r\n\r\nPeter the Venerable, who was Abbot of Clugni in the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century, is referred to by the historian Milner as a flagrant\r\nexample of the ignorance of the monastic authorities of his time.\r\nMaitland finds cause for no little indignation with the hasty and\r\nill-founded statements of Milner, and devotes several chapters to an\r\naccount of the monastery of Clugni under the rule of Peter, presenting\r\nvery ample evidence of the literary activity and scholarly interests\r\nof the abbot and of his close relations with the intellectual leaders\r\nof his time, leaders who were, with hardly an exception, monks and\r\necclesiastics. “Who will venture to say,” writes Maitland, “that Peter\r\nwould have been pilloried as an ignorant and trifling writer if Milner\r\nhad happened to have any personal knowledge of his history and his\r\nworks and if he had read in one of the long series of Peter’s Epistles\r\nthe words, _Libri et maxime Augustiniani, ut nosti, apud nos auro\r\npreciosiores sunt_.”[188] (Books, and especially those of S. Augustine,\r\nare esteemed by us as more precious than gold.)\r\n\r\nThe literary journeys of Mabillon were followed by similar journeys on\r\nthe part of Father Montfaucon and Edouard Martene, who were both, like\r\nMabillon, members of the learned Benedictines of St. Maur. Mabillon’s\r\njourneys covered the period of the long wars following the revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes (in 1685), including the campaigns between\r\nFrance and England in the Low Countries. It was probably due to these\r\ncampaigns that his researches did not include any of the monasteries\r\nof the lower Rhine, of Flanders, or of Brabant. Martene’s journeys\r\ncontinued during a term of six years, in which time he examined\r\nmanuscripts in more than one hundred cathedrals and at least eight\r\nhundred abbeys. The materials collected were utilised first in the new\r\nedition of the _Gallia Christiana_, and later, in five folio volumes,\r\ncomprising only matter previously unpublished, issued under the title\r\n_Thesaurus Novum Anecdotorum_. The account of the journey was printed\r\nunder the title _Voyage Littéraire de Deux Religieux Benedictins_.\r\n\r\nIn 1718, Martene and Montfaucon were again sent on their literary\r\ntravels, and the later collections were issued in 1724 in nine\r\nfolio volumes, under the title _Veterum Scriptorum et Monumentorum\r\nHistoricorum, Dogmaticorum, Moralium, Amplissima Collectio_. I specify\r\nthese works of the literary Benedictines because, although by their\r\ndate they do not properly belong to my narrative, they form a very\r\nimportant authority for what is known of the literary history of the\r\nmonasteries. In some of the monasteries which had in earlier times\r\nbeen famous as centres of literary activity, the libraries were found\r\nby Mabillon and Martene in a grievous condition of destitution and\r\ndilapidation. At Clugni, for instance, they describe the catalogue\r\n(itself six hundred years old), written on parchment-covered boards\r\nthree feet and a half long and eighteen inches wide (_grandes tablettes\r\nqu’on ferme comme un livre_), containing some thousands of titles, but\r\nof the books there remained scarcely one hundred. Martene was told that\r\nthe Huguenots had carried them off to Geneva. At Novantula, of all its\r\nformer riches Mabillon found but two manuscripts; and at Beaupré, of\r\nthe great collection of manuscripts there remained but two or three;\r\nwhile many other famous libraries were in similar condition. The\r\ndestruction of so large a portion of the collection of manuscripts and\r\nof the earlier printed books was due to a variety of causes. During the\r\nninth century, the ravages of the Danes and Normans brought desolation\r\nupon a long list of the monasteries throughout Europe which could most\r\neasily be reached from the coast. In the index to the third volume of\r\nMabillon’s annals, is given a long list of the Benedictine monasteries\r\npillaged or destroyed by the Normans. The record begins _Normanni,\r\nmonasteria et eis incensa, eversa, direpta_. In many of these\r\nvisitations the loss of books must have been considerable. When, for\r\ninstance, the abbey of Peterborough in Northamptonshire was burned by\r\nthe Danes in the year 870, Ingulph records the destruction of a large\r\ncollection of books, _sanctorum librorum ingens bibliotheca_.[189]\r\nMaitland points out that this expression probably stood for really a\r\ngreat library, as when Ingulph speaks of the destruction in 1091 of the\r\ncollection of 700 volumes belonging to his own monastery, he does not\r\nso describe it.[190]\r\n\r\nSerious ravages were also made in Central Europe in the tenth century\r\nby the Hungarians. Martene says that after the battle on the river\r\nBrenta, the pagans advanced to Novantula, killed many of the monks,\r\nand burned the monastery with a number of books, _codices multos\r\nconcremavere_.[191] The monasteries in Italy suffered primarily from\r\nthe Saracens, and those in Spain from the Moors. The losses caused by\r\nthe religious wars of the later centuries were, however, according to\r\nMabillon, much more serious than those brought about by the pagans.\r\nThe Calvinists are held responsible for the destruction, among others,\r\nof St. Theodore, near Vienna, of St. Jean, Grimberg, Dilighen, of\r\nJouaire, and, most important of all, of Fleury.[192] The ravages\r\ncaused by fire were possibly greater than those produced by war, many\r\nof the collections having been kept in wooden buildings. Among the\r\nnoted monasteries which suffered in this way were Gembloux, Liége,\r\nLucelle, Loroy, St. Gall, Fulda, Lorsch, Croyland, and Teano near\r\nMonte Cassino. In the burning of the latter perished, as Mabillon was\r\ninformed, the original manuscript of the famous Rule of S. Benedict.\r\nMartene speaks of the Church of Romans in Dauphiny as having been\r\nruined six times: by the Moors, by the Archbishop Sebon, twice by\r\nfire, by Guigne Dauphin in the twelfth century, and finally by the\r\nCalvinists. The library at the time of his visit still contained a few\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nIn view of these various classes of perils, it may well be a matter of\r\nwonder, not that the monastic collections have so largely perished, but\r\nthat so considerable a number of manuscripts has been preserved. The\r\nfact that so many mediæval manuscripts have escaped destruction by fire\r\nand flood, and have been saved from the ravages of invading pagans or\r\nof contending Christians, seems indeed to be good presumptive evidence\r\nof the enormous activity of literary production in the monastery\r\nscriptoria during the centuries between 529 and 1450, the date of the\r\nfounding of Monte Cassino, and that of the invention of printing.\r\n\r\n=The Libraries of the Monasteries and Their Arrangements for the\r\nExchange of Books.=--Geoffrey, sub-prior of S. Barbe, in Normandy,\r\nis the author of a phrase which has since been frequently quoted. In\r\na letter written in 1170 to Peter Mangot, a monk of Baugercy, in the\r\ndiocese of Tours, he says: “A monastery (_claustrum_) without a library\r\n(_sine armario_) is like a castle (_castrum_) without an armory (_sine\r\narmamentario_). Our library is our armory. Thence it is that we bring\r\nforth the sentences of the Divine Law like sharp arrows to attack\r\nthe enemy. Thence we take the armour of righteousness, the helmet of\r\nsalvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit, which is\r\nthe Word of God.”[193]\r\n\r\nAmong the monasteries whose collections of books were noteworthy and\r\nwhose literary exchanges were not infrequently sufficiently important\r\nto be described as a publishing or bookselling trade, may be mentioned\r\nthe following: Wearmouth and Yarrow, already referred to, the book\r\nproduction in which was active as early as the seventh century; St.\r\nJosse-sur-Mer, where, in the ninth century, the Abbot Loup of Ferrières\r\nis reported to have kept a depot of books, from which he carried on\r\nan active trade with England[194]; Bobbio in Lombardy, the literary\r\ntreasures in which have been largely preserved in the Ambrosian\r\nlibrary; the monastery of Pomposa near Ravenna, whose library,\r\ncollected by Abbot Jerome in 1093, was said to be finer than any other\r\nof the time in Italy; La Chiusa, whose collection rivalled that of\r\nPomposa; Novalese, whose library, at the time of the destruction of\r\nthe abbey by the Saracens in 905, is reported to have contained no\r\nless than 6500 volumes[195]; and Monte Cassino, which under the Abbot\r\nDidia, a friend of Gregory VII., possessed a very rich collection. This\r\ncollection was the result of the researches in Italy of the African\r\nConstantine, who, after having passed forty years in the East studying\r\nthe scientific treatises of Egypt, Persia, Chaldea, and India, had\r\nbeen driven from Carthage by envious rivals. He came to the tomb of\r\nS. Benedict, where he assumed the monastic habit, and he endowed his\r\nnew dwelling with the rich treasures collected in his wanderings.[196]\r\nThere are also to be mentioned Fulda, whose library at one time\r\nsurpassed all others in Germany, excepting perhaps that of St. Gall;\r\nCroyland, whose library in the eleventh century numbered 3000 volumes;\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\nThe work of Ziegelbauer gives in detail the old catalogue of the\r\nlibrary of Fulda and those of a number of other abbeys. The estimates\r\nof the relative importance of these collections are in the main\r\nbased upon Ziegelbauer’s statistics. There seems to be no question\r\nthat these monastery libraries carried on with each other an active\r\ncorrespondence and exchange of books, and that this exchange business\r\ndeveloped in not a few cases, as in that of St. Josse-sur-Mer, into\r\nwhat was practically a book-trade. It is the conclusion of Mabillon,\r\nas of Montalembert, that during the time in which Christian Europe\r\nwas covered with active monasteries and convents in which thousands\r\nof monks and nuns were engaged in constant transcription, books could\r\nhardly have been really rare, at least as compared with the extent of\r\nthe circle of scholars and readers who required them.\r\n\r\nCahier points out that in addition to these great monastery\r\ncollections, there were libraries of greater or less importance in\r\nnearly all the cathedrals, in many of the collegiate churches, and\r\nin not a few of the castles. Mabillon is of opinion that the prices\r\nof books during the Middle Ages have been very much overestimated,\r\nand that the impression as to such prices has been largely based upon\r\nisolated and misunderstood instances.[197] Robertson speaks of the\r\ncollection of Homilies bought in 1056 by Grecia, Countess of Arizon,\r\nfor two hundred sheep, a measure of wheat, one of millet, one of rye,\r\nseveral marten skins, and four pounds of silver, but Robertson omits\r\nto mention that the volumes so purchased were exceptionally beautiful\r\nspecimens of caligraphy, of painting, and of carving. Maitland points\r\nout that it would be as reasonable to quote as examples of prices in\r\nthe nineteenth century the exorbitant sums paid at special sales by\r\nthe bibliomaniacs of to-day. “May not some literary historian of the\r\nfuture,” he goes on to say, “at a time when the march of intellect\r\nhas got past the age of cumbersome and expansive penny magazines and\r\nis revelling in farthing cyclopædias, record as an evidence of the\r\nscarcity and costliness of books in the nineteenth century, that in\r\nthe year 1812 an English nobleman gave £2260 and another £1060 for\r\na single volume, and that the next year a Johnson’s Dictionary was\r\nsold by public auction for £200. A few such facts would quite set up\r\nsome future Robertson, whose readers would never dream that we could\r\nget better reading, and plenty of it, very much cheaper at that very\r\ntime.”[198]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, the case that there has been such a thing as\r\nbibliomania since there have been books in the world, no less in\r\nthe manuscript period than after the age of printing. “The art of\r\nprinting,” says Morier, “is unknown in Persia, and beautiful writing\r\nis, therefore, considered a high accomplishment. It is carefully taught\r\nin the schools, and those who excel in it are almost classed with\r\nliterary men. They are employed to copy books, and some have attained\r\nto such eminence in this art, that a few lines written by one of\r\nthese celebrated penmen are often sold for a considerable sum. I have\r\nknown seven pounds given for four lines written by Dervish Musjeed, a\r\ncelebrated penman, who has been dead for some time, and whose beautiful\r\nspecimens of writing are now scarce.”[199]\r\n\r\nRobertson quotes in support of his general contention a statement\r\nof Naudé to the following effect: “In 1471, when Louis XI. borrowed\r\nfrom the Faculty of Medicine in Paris the works of Rasis, the Arabian\r\nphysician, he not only deposited as a pledge a considerable quantity of\r\nplate, but was obliged to procure a nobleman to join with him as surety\r\nin a deed, binding himself, under a great forfeiture, to restore the\r\nvolumes.”[200] In the eighteenth century, however, when Selden wished\r\nto borrow a manuscript from the Bodleian Library, he was required to\r\ngive a bond for a thousand pounds. It does not, therefore, follow that\r\nthe reign of George II. was a dark age in English literature.[201]\r\n\r\nMaitland points out one very important detail, which served to\r\ngive to some individual manuscript a value that might, when later\r\nreferred to, appear disproportionate to the expense of the hand\r\nlabour in its preparation. Under the process of the multiplication\r\nof books by printing, each copy of a given edition must of course\r\nbe a fac-simile of all the other copies, sharing their measure of\r\ncorrectness, and equally sharing their blunders. In the manuscript\r\nperiod, however, every copy of a work was of necessity unique, and the\r\ncorrectness of a particular manuscript was no pledge for the quality\r\neven of those which had been copied directly from it. “In fact, the\r\ncorrectness of every single copy could be ascertained only by minute\r\nand laborious collation, and by the same minuteness of method which\r\nis now requisite from an editor who revises the text of an ancient\r\nwriter.... If a manuscript had received such a collation at the hands\r\nof trustworthy scholars, and if it had been shown to present a text of\r\nsuch completeness and accuracy as might safely be trusted as copy for\r\nfuture transcripts, such a manuscript would undoubtedly be valued at an\r\nexceptional price.”[202]\r\n\r\nMuratori speaks of books when presented to churches being offered\r\nat the altar, _pro remedio animæ suæ_,[203] and on this quotation\r\nRobertson bases a further argument concerning the high value of books.\r\nIt was, however, the ordinary routine that when a person made a present\r\nof anything to a church, it was offered at the altar, and it was\r\nunderstood, if not always specifically expressed, that such offering\r\nwas made either for his own spiritual benefit or for that of some other\r\nperson. It was doubtless the case that gifts of books to a church were\r\nrare as compared with the gifts of other things, for the simple reason\r\nthat nearly all the books that came into existence were produced in\r\nthe churches or in the attendant monasteries.\r\n\r\nDelisle says that the loan of books from monastery libraries was\r\nconsidered one of the most meritorious of all acts of mercy. Against\r\nthis view there are many examples of the formal prohibition of\r\nthe lending of any books outside of the walls of the monastery.\r\nSome communities placed the books of their libraries under an\r\nanathema,--that is to say, they forbade under pain of excommunication\r\neither borrowing or lending. This selfish policy was, however, formally\r\ncondemned in 1212 by the Council of Paris, the Fathers of which urged\r\nmore charitable sentiments on these bibliophiles: “We forbid monks to\r\nbind themselves by any oath not to lend books to the poor, seeing that\r\nsuch a loan is one of the chief works of mercy. We desire that the\r\nbooks of a community should be divided into two classes, one to remain\r\nin the house for the use of the Brothers, the other to be lent out to\r\nthe poor according to the judgment of the abbot.”[204]\r\n\r\nIn support of his contention concerning the general disappearance of\r\nliterature during the Middle Ages, Robertson quotes the authority of\r\nMuratori to the effect that, “even monasteries of considerable note\r\nhad only one missal.”[205] Maitland has no difficulty in showing\r\nthat the passage cited has been wrongly understood, and that the\r\ngeneralisation based upon it is absurd. Muratori was referring to a\r\nletter of a certain Bonus, who was for thirty years (1018-1048) Abbot\r\nof the monastery of S. Michael, in Pisa. In this letter, Bonus gives an\r\naccount of the founding of the monastery, and says that when he came\r\nto Pisa he found there, not a monastery, but simply a chapel, which\r\nwas in a most deplorable and destitute condition, wanting vessels,\r\nvestments, bells, and nearly all the requisites for the performance\r\nof divine service, and having no service-books but a missal (_nisi\r\nunum missale_). The statement so worded is of course no evidence that\r\nthere may not have been several copies of the missal. It simply shows\r\nthat there were no other books (such as texts of the Epistles or\r\nGospels) for use in the service. Bonus goes on to say, with commendable\r\npride, that in fifteen years’ time “the little hut,” as he calls\r\nit, had expanded into a monastery, with suitable offices and with a\r\nconsiderable estate in land, the single tin cup had been exchanged\r\nfor gold and silver chalices, and in place of one “missal,” the monks\r\nrejoiced in the possession of a library of thirty-four volumes. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how Robertson could have justified himself in\r\nbasing, on a careless version of a statement concerning a missal in\r\na single half-ruined chapel, a broad and misleading generalisation\r\nconcerning the general absence of books from monasteries. The list of\r\nthe library later secured by the abbot includes copies of the Gospels,\r\nthe Psalms, and the Epistles, the Rule of S. Benedict, the Book of\r\nJob, the Book of Ezekiel, five Diurnals, eight _Antiphonarii_, three\r\nNocturnals, a tractate by S. Augustine on Genesis, a book of Dialogues,\r\na Glossary, a Pastoral, a book of Canons, a book entitled _Summum\r\nBonum_, five Missals, a book entitled _Passionarum unum novum ubi sunt\r\nomnes passiones ecclesiasticæ_ (I give the wording from the catalogue),\r\nand the _Liber Bibliotheca_. “Bibliotheca” is the term very generally\r\napplied at this period to the Bible, and often used for a collection\r\ncomprising but a few books of the Bible. The catalogue shows that the\r\ngood Abbot had made a very fair beginning towards a monastic library.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Gerbert, Abbot of Bobbio (who, in 998, became Pope\r\nunder the name of Sylvester II.), throw some light upon the literary\r\ninterests of that famous monastery and of the time. He writes (about\r\n984) to a monk named Rainald (letter 130 of the collection): “You know\r\nwith what zeal I seek for copies of books from all quarters, and you\r\nknow how many scribes there are everywhere in Italy, both in the cities\r\nand in the rural districts, I entreat you then ... that you will have\r\ntranscripts made for me of M. Manilius’ _De Astrologia_, Victorinus’\r\n_De Rhetorica_, and of the _Ophthalmicus_ of Demosthenes.... Whatever\r\nyou lay out I will repay you to the full, according to your accounts.”\r\nIn letter 123, Gerbert writes to Thietmar of Mayence for a portion\r\nof one of the works of Boëthius, his copy being defective. In letter\r\n9, written to Abbot Giselbert, he asks for assistance in making good\r\ncertain deficiencies in his manuscript of the oration of Cicero, _Pro\r\nRege Deiotaro_. In letter 8, to the Archbishop of Rheims, he requests\r\nthat prelate to borrow for him from Abbot Azo a copy of Cæsar’s\r\n_Commentaries_. In return he offers the loan of eight volumes of\r\nBoëthius. In letter 7, he requests his friend Airard to attend to the\r\ncorrection of the manuscript of Pliny, and to preparing transcripts\r\nof two other manuscripts. In letter 44, to Egbert, Abbot of Tours, he\r\nstates that he has been much occupied in collecting a library, and that\r\nhe had for a long time been paying transcribers in Rome, in other parts\r\nof Italy, in Germany, and in Belgium, and in buying at great expense\r\ntexts of important authors. He asks the Abbot to aid in doing similar\r\nwork in France, and he gives a list (unfortunately lost) of the works\r\nfor transcripts of which he is looking. He is ready to supply the\r\nparchment and to defray all the expenses of the work. In other letters\r\nhe makes reference to his own writings on rhetoric, arithmetic, and\r\nspherical geometry.\r\n\r\nThese letters, for the reference to which I am indebted to\r\nMaitland,[206] assuredly give the impression that even in the dark\r\nperiod of the tenth century, there was no little activity in certain\r\necclesiastical circles and monastic centres in the transcribing,\r\ncollecting, and exchanging of books, and not merely of missals,\r\nbreviaries, or monkish legends, but of literature recognised as classic.\r\n\r\nAnother letter, written a century and a half later, makes reference\r\nto the practice of exchanging books or of using them as pledges. A\r\nprior writes to an abbot in 1150: “To his Lord, the Venerable Abbot\r\nof---- wishes health and happiness. Although you desire to have the\r\nbooks of Tully, I know that you are a Christian and not a Ciceronian.\r\nBut you go over to the camp of the enemy not as a deserter, but as\r\na spy. I should, therefore, have sent you the books of Tully which\r\nwe have, _De Re Agraria_, the Philippics, and the Epistles, but that\r\nit is not our custom that any books should be lent to any person\r\nwithout good pledges. Send us, therefore, the _Noctes Atticæ_ of Aulus\r\nGellius and Origen on the Canticles. The books which we have just\r\nbrought from France, if you wish for any of them, I will send you.”\r\nThe Abbot replies at the end of a long letter: “I have sent you as\r\npledges for your books, Origen on the Canticles, and instead of Aulus\r\nGellius (which I could not have at this time), a book which is called\r\n_Strategematon_, which is military.”[207]\r\n\r\nThe custom of securing books by chains, which prevailed with the\r\nlibraries of all the earlier religious institutions, did not originate\r\nwith these. Eusebius mentions that the Roman Senate in the time of\r\nClaudius ordered the treatise of Philo Judæus on the Impiety of\r\nCaligula to be chained in the library as a famous monument. There\r\nappears to have been an early appreciation on the part of certain of\r\nthe monastery scholars of the importance of indexes. Fosbroke quotes\r\namong others the example of John Brome, Prior of Gorlestone, who, in\r\nthe fifteenth century, put indexes to almost all the books in his\r\nlibrary. From an examination of the catalogues of various of the\r\necclesiastical libraries, Fosbroke arrives at the calculation that the\r\nproportion of the works contained under the several main sub-headings\r\nwas approximately as follows: Divinity, 175; scholastic literature,\r\n89; epistles and controversial literature, 65; history, 54; biography,\r\n32; arts, mathematics, and astrology, 31; philosophy, 13; law, 6.[208]\r\nThis classification does not give any separate heading for allegory,\r\nalthough this was a subject in which not a few of the earlier monkish\r\nwriters largely interested themselves.\r\n\r\nAs an example of monkish allegorical literature, Fosbroke mentions a\r\nwork written in 1435, under the instructions of a cloth shearer in\r\nFrance, whose name he does not give. The cloth cutter, being a great\r\nlover of tennis, had written a ballad upon that game. When he was\r\nold, he wished to atone for his early sins and frivolities, and he\r\nsecured the services of a Dominican monk, who wrote, at his instance\r\nand expense, an allegory on the game of tennis. The wall of the tennis\r\ncourt stood for faith, which should always rest on a solid foundation,\r\nwhile in the other conditions of the game the Dominican finds the\r\ncardinal virtues, the evangelists, active and contemplative life, the\r\nold and the new law, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, Omons, who might be described as the\r\nLucretius of his day, wrote a work entitled _The Picture of the World_,\r\nfrom which one could gather an impression of the character of the\r\nphilosophy of the early Middle Ages. In the department of metaphysics,\r\nOmons (using largely material borrowed from Thales, Anaxagoras,\r\nEpicurus, and Plato) described God as comparatively an idle being, and\r\nspeaks of Him as having at the time of creating Matter also created\r\nNature. Nature executed the will of God as an axe executes the will of\r\nthe carpenter; it sometimes, however, through want or excess of matter,\r\nproduces deformities.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Arts, Omons divides under the usual septenary\r\narrangement, which is adopted as early as the fifth century by Capella.\r\nOmons makes mathematics, however, not a mere science of numbers, but\r\nthe knowledge of everything that is produced in any regular order\r\nwhatever, while rhetoric includes judicial verdicts, decretals, laws,\r\netc. The term “liberal” he applied only to an art which explicitly\r\nappertained to the mind; and therefore, medicine, painting, sculpture,\r\nnavigation, the military art, architecture, etc., although in their\r\ntheories as intellectual as are mathematics and astronomy, were,\r\nbecause applicable to bodily purposes, denominated trades. The term\r\n“philosopher” means only men versed in the occult sciences of nature,\r\nand among the later philosophers Omons held no one so eminent as\r\nVirgil. This was not the Bard of Mantua, but an ugly little Italian\r\nconjurer, who, during the tenth century, had performed various feats of\r\nlegerdemain.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter of Celle had borrowed two volumes of S. Bernard’s works,\r\nhe wrote to him: “Make haste and quickly copy these and send them to\r\nme; and according to my bargain, cause a copy to be made for me, and\r\nboth those which I have sent to you, and the copies, as I have said,\r\nsend to me, and take care that I do not lose a single tittle.” Writing\r\nto the Dean of Troyes, he says: “Send me the Epistles of the Bishop\r\nof Le Mans, for I want to copy them”; and, indeed, he seems to have a\r\nconstant eye to the acquisition and multiplication of books.[209]\r\n\r\nAs to this _commercium librorum_, it would be easy, says Maitland, to\r\nmultiply examples. In a letter of the Abbot Peter to Guigo, Prior of\r\nChartreuse, he mentions that he had sent him the Lives of S. Nazianzen\r\nand S. Chrysostom, and the argument of S. Ambrose against Symmachus.\r\nThat he had not sent the work of Hilary on the Psalms because his copy\r\ncontained the same defect as the Prior’s. That he did not possess\r\n_Prosper against Cassius_, but that he had sent to Aquitaine for a\r\ncopy. He begs the Prior to send the greater volume of S. Augustine,\r\ncontaining the letters which passed between him and S. Jerome, because\r\na great part of their copy, while lying in one of the cells, had been\r\neaten by a bear (_casu comedit ursus_),[210] a novel difficulty in the\r\nway of preserving literature.\r\n\r\nPeter of Clugni, known as Peter the Venerable, became abbot of the\r\nmonastery in 1122. Clugni, the _Caput Ordinis_, was at that time the\r\nmost considerable of the Benedictine foundations, and might, in fact,\r\nbe termed the most important monastery of its age. The correspondence\r\nof Peter and of his secretary Nicholas, who was for a time also\r\nsecretary of Bernard of Clairvaux, forms an important contribution to\r\nthe monastic history of the country and contains not a few references\r\nthrowing light on the literary conditions of the time. Nicholas had,\r\nin addition to his business as the Abbot’s amanuensis, what Mabillon\r\ncalls a _librorum commercium_ with various persons. It appears from his\r\nletters that he used to lend books on condition that a copy should be\r\nreturned with the volume lent. Nicholas, while a diligent scribe and an\r\nactive-minded scholar, was discovered later, to be a very untrustworthy\r\nperson. He left Clairvaux with books, money, and gold service that did\r\nnot belong to him, and also (which Abbot Bernard mentions as a special\r\ngrievance) with three seals, his own, the prior’s, and the abbot’s.\r\nHis further career was a checkered one, but does not belong to this\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nAbbot Peter of Clugni, writing to Master Peter of Poitiers in 1170,\r\nlays some emphasis on the inadvisability of devoting too much time\r\nto the study of the ancients. “See, now, without the study of Plato,\r\nwithout the disputations of the Academy, without the subtleties of\r\nAristotle, without the teaching of philosophers, the place and the way\r\nof happiness are discovered.... You run from school to school, and why\r\nare you labouring to teach and to be taught? Why is it that you are\r\nseeking through thousands of words and multiplied labours, what you\r\nmight, if you pleased, obtain in plain language and with little labour?\r\nWhy, vainly studious, are you reciting with the comedians, lamenting\r\nwith the tragedians, trifling with the metricians, deceiving with the\r\npoets and deceived with the philosophers? Why is it that you are now\r\ntaking so much trouble about what is not in fact philosophy but should\r\nrather (if I may say it without offence) be called foolishness.”\r\n\r\nCounsels of this kind give some indication at least of the tendency\r\nin Poitiers, and doubtless also in Clugni, to devote to the old-time\r\npoetry and philosophy some of the hours which, under a stricter\r\nobservance, should be reserved for the Scriptures or the Fathers.\r\nThe venerable Abbot must himself have had some fairly comprehensive\r\nknowledge of the literature he was criticising, and the gentle satire\r\nof the phrase “deceived with the philosophers” does not give one the\r\nimpression of coming from a clumsy-minded and ignorant monk such as\r\nRobertson describes Peter the Venerable to have been.\r\n\r\nA further evidence not only of comprehensive knowledge but of a\r\nliberal spirit, is afforded by the fact that Peter gave to the West\r\na translation (possibly the first) of the Alkoran. This is the form\r\nused by Peter himself for the Mohammedan scriptures. In a letter to\r\nS. Bernard, he speaks of having had this translation prepared of a\r\nwork which had so greatly influenced the thought of the world that it\r\nought to be known to Europe. He says further that the defenders of\r\nthe true faith should familiarise themselves with the contentions of\r\nthe Mohammedan heretics, in order to be able to refute these when the\r\nnecessity arose.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSOME LIBRARIES OF THE MANUSCRIPT PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following are some of the more important collections referred to in\r\nthe records of the Middle Ages. In Constantinople the Patriarch had a\r\nlibrary in Thomaïtes which was said to be of considerable importance,\r\nand the works in it are referred to very often in the transactions\r\nof the Synods. This collection was destroyed by fire in 780, but\r\nwas speedily replaced. Many of the monasteries of the Greek Church\r\npossessed libraries, and in some of these libraries were preserved the\r\noldest manuscripts known to the world. Among the most important of\r\nthese collections was that contained in the monastery of Mt. Athos,\r\nsome of the treasures of which have been preserved to the present day.\r\nDuring the time of Basilius Macedo (867-886), much work was said to\r\nhave been done by the scribes of this monastery.[212]\r\n\r\nIn Egypt it is claimed that until the conquest by the Arab, there was a\r\ngood deal of literary activity in the monasteries, and in the monastery\r\nof S. Catherine of the Sinai range were preserved some specimens of the\r\nearlier manuscripts, of which the Testament discovered by Tischendorf\r\nis the most important example.\r\n\r\nThe Library of S. Giovanni in Naples, from which many valuable Greek\r\nmanuscripts were secured for the Royal Library in Vienna, was not an\r\nold monastery collection, but had its origin, according to Blume, with\r\nJanus Parrhasius.[213] The Augustin monks presented the collection\r\nin 1729 to the Emperor Charles VI., in order that they might not be\r\ndisturbed in their seclusion by the visits of zealous scholars.[214]\r\n\r\nThe earliest of ecclesiastical libraries was probably that collected\r\nby Bishop Alexander, in Jerusalem, at the beginning of the third\r\ncentury. Fifty years later a library was founded at Cesarea by Origen,\r\nwhich is described as extensive and important.[215] Collections were\r\nalso made at an early date at Hippo, at Cirta, at Constantinople, and\r\nat S. Peter’s and the Lateran in Rome. All these earlier libraries\r\nwere apparently connected with the churches, and in most cases places\r\nhad been found for them within the church walls. Clark quotes from a\r\nnarrative of the persecution of 303-304 a paragraph saying that the\r\nofficers “went to the church where the Christians used to assemble, and\r\nspoiled it of chalices, lamps, etc., but when they came to the library\r\n(_bibliothecam_), the presses (_armaria_) were found empty.”[216] From\r\nthis reference we may conclude that the several vessels and the books\r\nwere in different parts of the same building.\r\n\r\nThe library of S. Augustine was bequeathed to the church of Hippo, and\r\nthe collection was preserved within the church building.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of the libraries in all the Benedictine monasteries\r\nwere based upon the Rule of S. Benedict (see _ante_, p. 28). As Order\r\nafter Order was founded, there came to be a steady development of\r\nfeeling in regard to books, and an ever increasing care for their\r\nsafe-keeping. S. Benedict had contented himself with general directions\r\nfor study; the Cluniacs prescribe the selection of a special officer\r\nto take charge of the books, with an annual audit of the collection,\r\nand the assignment to each Brother of a single volume for his year’s\r\nstudy. The Cistercians and Carthusians provide for the loan of books to\r\noutsiders under certain conditions, and the practice was later adopted\r\nby the Benedictines. The Augustinians prescribe the kind of press\r\n(_armarium_) in which the books are to be kept, and both they and the\r\nPremonstratensians permit their books to be lent on receipt of pledges\r\nof sufficient value. Even the Mendicant Friars, who, under the original\r\nRule of their Order, had restrained themselves from holding possessions\r\nof any kind, found before long that books were indispensable, so that\r\ntheir libraries came to excel those of most other Orders. Richard de\r\nBury, in his _Philobiblon_, says of the Mendicants: “These men are as\r\nants, ever preparing their meat in the summer, or as ingenious bees\r\ncontinually fabricating cells of honey ... although they lately at the\r\neleventh hour have entered the Lord’s vineyard, they have added more\r\nin this brief hour to the stock of sacred books than all the other\r\nvine-dressers.”\r\n\r\nClark points out that the word _Library_ was used by the Benedictines\r\nlong before any special room was assigned in the Benedictine House as a\r\nstorage place for the books. He is of opinion that until the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries the books were for the most part kept in the\r\ncloisters, the only portions of the monastery buildings, except the\r\nrefectory and occasionally the _califactorium_ (warming-house), in\r\nwhich the monks were allowed to congregate. The books so stored in the\r\ncloisters were shut up in presses, which secured for them a certain\r\namount of protection. The term applied to these presses, _armaria_, was\r\nthat used by the Romans for their book-cases. The monk charged with\r\nthe care of the books took his name not from the books themselves, as\r\nin later times, but from the presses which contained them, and was\r\ngenerally styled _armarius_.\r\n\r\nIn some of the monasteries where literary studies were pursued with\r\nspecial ardour, the more persistent readers and scribes were provided\r\nwith small wooden compartments or studies called _carrells_. In the\r\nbook called the _Rites of Durham_ is given the following description\r\nof these carrells: “In the north syde of the cloister, from the corner\r\nover againste the church dour to the corner over againste the Dorter\r\ndour, was all fynely glased from the hight to the sole within a little\r\nof the ground into the Cloister garth, and in every window _iij_\r\nPewes or Carrells, where every one of the old monks had his carrell,\r\nseveral by himselfs, that, when they had dyned, they dyd resort to that\r\nplace of Cloister, and there studyed upon these books, every one in\r\nhis carrell, all the after nonne, unto evensong tyme. This was there\r\nexercise every daie.... In every carrell was a deske to lye there books\r\nupon, and the carrell was no greater than from one stanchell of the\r\nwyndowe to another, and over againste the carrells againste the church\r\nwall, did stande certain great almeries (or cupbords) of waynscott all\r\nfull of bookes (with great store of ancient manuscripts to help them in\r\ntheir study) wherein did lye as well the old anncyent written Doctors\r\nof the Church as other prophane authors, with dyverse other holie\r\nmen’s wourks, so that every one did studye what Doctor pleased them\r\nbest, havinge the Librarie at all tymes to goe studye in besydes there\r\ncarrells.”[217]\r\n\r\nIn the _Customs_ of the Augustinian priory of Barnwell, written towards\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century, the following passage occurs: “The\r\npress in which the books are kept ought to be lined inside with wood,\r\nthat the damp of the walls may not moisten or stain the books. This\r\npress should be divided vertically as well as horizontally by sundry\r\npartitions, on which the books may be ranged so as to be separated from\r\none another: for fear they be packed so close as to injure each other,\r\nor to delay those who want them.”\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of the House of the White Canons at Titchfield in\r\nHampshire, dated 1400, shows that the books were kept in a small room,\r\non shelves called _columpnæ_, and set against the walls. A closet\r\nof this kind was evidently not a working place, but simply a place\r\nof storage. By the beginning of the fifteenth century, the larger\r\nmonasteries had accumulated many hundred volumes, and it began to be\r\ncustomary to provide for the collections separate quarters, rooms\r\nconstructed for the purpose. The presses in the cloisters were still\r\nutilised for books in daily reference.\r\n\r\nIn Christ Church, Canterbury, where as early as the fourteenth century,\r\nthe collection comprised as many as 698 books, a library at Durham was\r\nbuilt about 1425 by Archbishop Chichele: the library at Durham was\r\nbuilt about the same time by Prior Wessyngton. That at Citeaux, which\r\nwas placed over the _scriptorium_, dates from 1480, and that of St.\r\nGermain des Prés from 1513. The collection of the latter foundation\r\nwas one of the earliest in France, and as early as the beginning of\r\nthe thirteenth century, there is record of its being consulted by\r\nstrangers. At the time of the French Revolution, it contained 7000\r\nmanuscripts and 4900 printed books.[218]\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Sicily, who in 1517 visited Clairvaux, one of the two\r\ngreat Cistercian foundations in France, describes the library as\r\nfollows: “On the same side of the cloister are fourteen studies, where\r\nthe monks do their reading and writing, and over these studies, one\r\nmounts by a broad spiral staircase to the new library. This library\r\nis 189 feet long by 17 feet wide. It contains 48 seats (_bancs_) and\r\nin each banc four shelves (_poulpitres_) furnished with books on all\r\nsubjects, but chiefly theology; the greater number of the said books\r\nare of vellum and are written by hand, richly storied and illuminated.”\r\n\r\nThe phrase “written by hand,” indicates that the Queen was already\r\nacquainted with books produced from type, some of which had in fact\r\nbeen produced in Italy as early as 1464.\r\n\r\nAnother description, written in 1723 by the author of the _Voyage\r\nLittéraire_, speaks of “the fifteen little cells, all in a row, where\r\nthe Brethren formerly used to write books, for which reason they are\r\nstill called the writing rooms. Over these cells is the library, the\r\nbuilding for which is large, vaulted, well lighted, and stocked with a\r\nlarge number of manuscripts, fastened by chains to desks; but there are\r\nnot many printed books.”\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the statutes affecting the library imposed upon the\r\ncolleges of Oxford and Cambridge, were evidently borrowed directly from\r\nthe customs of the monasteries. The statutes of Oriel College, Oxford,\r\ndated 1329, present an example: “The common books (_libri communes_)\r\nof the House are to be brought out and inspected once a year, on the\r\nfeast of the Commemoration of Souls (November 2d) in the presence of\r\nthe Provost or his deputy, and of the scholars (Fellows). Each one\r\nof the scholars, in the order of seniority, may select a single book\r\nwhich either treats of the science to which he is devoting himself, or\r\nwhich he requires for his use. This he may keep until the same festival\r\nin the succeeding year, when a similar selection of books is to take\r\nplace, and so on, from year to year. If there should happen to be more\r\nbooks than persons, those that remain are to be selected in the same\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\nA statute of Archbishop Lanfranc, for the English Benedictines, dated\r\n1070, and based, as he tells us, on the general monastic practice of\r\nhis time, gives the following regulation: “On the Monday after the\r\nfirst Sunday in Lent, before Brethren come into the Chapter House, the\r\nlibrarian [here called not _armarius_ but _custos librorum_] shall\r\nhave a carpet laid down and all the books got together upon it, except\r\nthose which the year previous had been assigned for reading. These the\r\nBrethren are to bring with them, when they come into the Chapter House,\r\neach his book in his hand. Then the librarian shall read a statement as\r\nto the manner in which Brethren have had books during the past year.\r\nAs each Brother hears his name pronounced, he is to give back the book\r\nwhich had been entrusted to him for reading; and he whose conscience\r\naccuses him of not having read through the book which he had received,\r\nis to fall on his face, confess his fault, and entreat forgiveness.\r\nThe librarian shall then make a fresh distribution of books, namely a\r\ndifferent volume to each Brother for his reading.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear from this reference as if Lanfranc’s monks were under\r\nobligations to read through but one book each year, which was certainly\r\na very moderate allowance. It is also to be noted that the books appear\r\nnot to have been distributed according to the preferences of the\r\nreaders, but to have been assigned at the will of the librarian. There\r\nmust certainly have been no little difference in the character and\r\nextent of the duty imposed of reading through one book (even with so\r\nlong an allowance of time) according to the particular volume which the\r\n_custos_ saw fit to assign. The worthy Archbishop writes, however, as\r\nif a book were a book and one as good for edification or as fitting for\r\npenance as another.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there were two classes of volumes, one utilised for\r\ndistribution for separate reading, and the other reserved for reference\r\nand placed in a separate room (first called _armarium_ and later\r\n_bibliotheca_) where they were fastened with irons chains to lecterns\r\nor reading-desks.\r\n\r\nIn the various details concerning the distribution of books, the\r\narrangement of the lecterns for the chained books, etc., the\r\npractice in the early colleges was evidently modelled on that of the\r\nmonasteries. The system of chaining, as adopted in England, would allow\r\nof the books being readily taken down from the shelves and placed\r\non the lectern for reading. One end of the chain was attached to the\r\nmiddle of the upper edge of the right-hand board or cover; the other to\r\na ring which played on a bar which set in front of the shelf on which\r\nthe book stood. The fore-edge of the books, not the back, was turned\r\nto the front. A swivel, usually in the middle of the chain, prevented\r\ntangling. The chains varied in length according to the distance of the\r\nshelf from the desk.[219]\r\n\r\nIn a copy of Locke’s _Treatise on the Epistles_, printed in 1711,\r\nMaitland found inscribed the following “advertisement”: “Since, to\r\nthe great reproach of the nations and a much greater one of our Holy\r\nReligion, the thievish disposition of some that enter into libraries\r\nto learn there no good, hath made it necessary to secure the innocent\r\nbooks, and even the sacred volumes themselves, with chains (which are\r\nbetter deserved by those ill persons who have too much learning to be\r\nhanged and too little to be honest), care should be taken hereafter\r\nthat as additions shall be made to this library (of which there is a\r\nhopeful expectation), the chains should neither be longer nor more\r\nclumsy than the use of them requires, and that the loops whereby they\r\nare fastened to the books may be rivetted on such a part of the cover\r\nand so smoothly as not to gall or raze the books while these are\r\nremoved from or to their respective places.”[220]\r\n\r\nIsidore, Bishop of Seville (_c._ 560-636), possessed probably the\r\nlargest collection of books at that time in Europe. It was contained\r\nin fourteen presses or _armaria_, each of which was ornamented with a\r\nbust and inscribed with verses. The series of verses concludes with\r\nthe following notice addressed _ad interventorem_, a term which may be\r\ninterpreted _a talkative intruder_:\r\n\r\n  _Non patitur quemquam coram se scriba loquentem;\r\n  Non est hic quod agas, garrule, perge foras._\r\n\r\n(The scribe allows no one to speak in his presence; there is nothing\r\nfor you to do here, chatterbox; you had better go outside)--a motto\r\nwhich would serve very well for a reading-room of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn Rome the Church had, from an early date, preserved a collection of\r\nmanuscripts which related more particularly to church matters, but\r\nwhich included also some specimens of the Roman Classics. In 855,\r\nLupus, of Ferrières, writes to Pope Benedict III., begging for the\r\nloan of certain texts from which to make transcripts. He specifies the\r\nCommentary of S. Jerome on Jeremiah, Cicero _de Oratore_, Quintilian,\r\nand Terence.[221]\r\n\r\nIn the centuries following, however, as the Roman Church sank into a\r\ncondition of ignorance and strife, and Italy was continuously upset\r\nby invasions, the library in Rome and the collections which had been\r\ninstituted in certain churches outside of Rome were either seriously\r\nlessened or entirely destroyed. As late, however, as 1276, a few\r\nvaluable manuscripts were still to be found in the church collections.\r\nWattenbach speaks of the collection in Verona, in the library of the\r\nTown Hall, as one of the most important of those in Italy in which old\r\nmanuscripts have been preserved to the present time. Next in importance\r\namong the older collections, he mentions that of Hexham in England,\r\nwhich had been originally collected by Bishop Acca in the year 700, and\r\nwhich is referred to by Bede.[222]\r\n\r\nWith this is to be mentioned the library of York, which is first\r\ndescribed by Alcuin.[223]\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier important library collections was that of the\r\nmonastery of Vivaria, which had been founded by Cassiodorus; the\r\nwritings were classified according to their contents, and were arranged\r\nin a series of _armaria_.\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of the seventh century, the most noteworthy\r\ncollection was that of Bobbio, a portion of which remained as late as\r\n1618, and was taken by Paul V. for the Vatican Library. Another portion\r\nfound its way to Turin.\r\n\r\nThe literary activity of the monastery of Corbie has already been\r\nmentioned, and the library there continued in existence during the\r\nentire lifetime of the monastery. After 1350 the monks appear to have\r\nthemselves given up the work of writing. Étienne de Conty is recorded\r\nas one of the special benefactors of the library. He collected books\r\nfor it, and he employed special scribes to add to the collection.[224]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the monastery of Reichenau was noted as early as 821 for\r\nits excellent collection of manuscripts. The librarian Reginbert\r\nprepared in 821 an exhaustive catalogue of the collection. Not a few of\r\nthe manuscripts were, as appeared by the notes in the catalogue, the\r\nwork of his own hands. Of these manuscripts, which he had prepared with\r\nso great zeal and labour, there have remained but five sheets of one\r\nbook, with a portion of the catalogue.\r\n\r\nOf nearly as early a date is the first catalogue of the library of\r\nSt. Gall, previously referred to; in the catalogue of this there are\r\nbeneath the titles various critical notes. There is record of the loan\r\nof books to the Emperor Charles III., to Frau Rickert, and to Liutward,\r\nBishop of Vercelli.[225]\r\n\r\nIn the monastery of Pomposa, in Lombardy, Abbot Jerome brought together\r\nin the eleventh century (in spite of certain grumblings on the part\r\nof the monks, the ground for which is not clearly explained) a great\r\ncollection of manuscripts.[226] A certain Henricus Clericus, writing\r\n in 1093, describing this collection to a friend, says that in no\r\nchurch, not even in Rome, could so wonderful a group of books be found.\r\nHenricus prepared a catalogue of the library, and at the close of\r\nthe catalogue he finds it necessary, as a matter of consistency, to\r\napologise for the abbot who had ventured to include in the collection\r\nheathen books. The presence of such books, known at the time as _libri\r\nscholastici_, was, however, by no means exceptional in monastery\r\ncollections, and in many of these were to be found copies of Virgil,\r\nOvid, and particularly Cicero. While this was more frequently the case\r\nin Italy, it occurred also in Germany. An inventory made in 1233 of the\r\nmonastery of Neumünster, near Wurzburg, includes in a special list the\r\ntitles of a number of the Classics.\r\n\r\nA similar separate catalogue of _libri scholastici_ was made in 1297\r\nfor the collection in the cathedral library of Lübeck.\r\n\r\nWhile the principal increase in the monastery libraries had been\r\nsecured through the work of scribes and through exchanges, and\r\noccasionally through purchases, a considerable proportion of the books\r\ncame to them through gifts or bequests. The gift that it was customary\r\nfor a novice to make on entering a monastery very frequently took the\r\nform of books.\r\n\r\nIn 1055, the priest Richlof, in placing his son with the Benedictines,\r\ngave as an accompanying present a farm and some books, and his mother\r\ngave a copy of a treatise of S. Ambrose.[227]\r\n\r\nLéon Maitre says that in Fleury, each new scholar was expected to\r\npresent at least two codices. Towards the end of the eleventh century,\r\na noble cleric, who entered as a monk the monastery at Tegernsee,\r\nbrought with him so many books that, according to the account, when\r\nplaced by the principal altar they covered this from top to bottom.[228]\r\n\r\nIn what was known as the Scottish Monastery, near Vienna, there\r\nwas kept in the thirteenth century a record of gifts, which record\r\nincludes a long list of presents of books. In the latter part of the\r\ncentury, the monastery appears to have degenerated, the library fell\r\ninto disuse, and the presents of books ceased. In 1418 the so-called\r\nScottish monks were driven out, and the foundation was taken possession\r\nof by Germans. From this date the record of gifts of books again began.\r\n\r\nIn 1453, the monastery received as a bequest from Dr. Johannes\r\nPolzmacher his entire library. The library came to include a\r\nconsiderable list of works on jurisprudence together with a series of\r\nclassics, including several copies of Ovid. The latter appears to have\r\nbeen a special favourite in the monastic collections. The books on\r\njurisprudence were utilised for the profit of the monastery by being\r\nloaned out to the jurisprudence Faculty of the university. They were,\r\nit appears, also occasionally loaned to the students for transcribing.\r\nIn the chance of the manuscripts suffering damage while out on hire,\r\nthe borrower was compelled to deposit an adequate pledge in the shape\r\neither of money or other valuable property.[229]\r\n\r\nThe monastery in Bobbio received books from wandering Irishmen, as is\r\nindicated by the following inscription:\r\n\r\n  _Sancte Columba, tibi Scotto tuus incola Dungal,\r\n  Tradidit hunc librum, quo fratrum corda beentur.\r\n  Qui legis ergo, Deus pretium sit muneris ora._[230]\r\n\r\n(Holy Columba of Scotland, thy votary Dungal has bestowed upon thee\r\nthis book, whereby the hearts of the brothers may be gladdened. Do thou\r\nwho readest it pray that God may be the reward of thy labour.)\r\n\r\nIn the monastery of St. Père-de-Chartres the Abbot Alveus, who died in\r\n955, presented to S. Peter a book _Pro Vita Æterna_.[231]\r\n\r\nDietrich Schreiber, a citizen of Halle, who, notwithstanding his name,\r\nis said not to have been a scribe, gave, in 1239, for the good of his\r\nsoul, to the preaching Brothers of Leipzig, a canonistic manuscript,\r\nwith the condition that either of his sons should have the privilege of\r\nredeeming the same for the sum of five marks, in case he might require\r\nit in connection with his study of the law.[232] Robert of Lille, who\r\ndied in 1339, left in his will to his daughters a certain illuminated\r\ncalendar, with the condition attached that after their death the\r\ncalendar was to be given to the nuns of Chikessaund.[233]\r\n\r\nIt is also the case that bequests securing an annual income were\r\noccasionally given with the specific purpose of founding or endowing\r\nmonastery _scriptoria_ and libraries. The Abbot of St. Père-de-Chartres\r\nordered, in 1145, that the tenants or others recognising the authority\r\nof the monastery must take up each year for the support of the library\r\nthe sum of eighty-six solidos.[234]\r\n\r\nHis successor, Fulbert, instituted a new room for the collection\r\nand kept the monks themselves at work, so that in 1367 a catalogue,\r\ninscribed in four rolls, gives the titles of 201 volumes.[235]\r\n\r\nAlso in Evesham, in Worcestershire, England, a statute enacted in\r\n1215 provides that certain tenths coming into the priory should be\r\nreserved for the purpose of buying parchment and for the increase of\r\nthe library. During the following year the amount available for this\r\npurpose was five solidos, eighteen deniers.[236]\r\n\r\nThe account books of the monks of Ely showed that in the year 1300\r\nthey purchased five dozen sheets of parchment, four pounds of ink,\r\neight calf-skins, four sheep-skins, five dozen sheets of vellum, and\r\nsix pairs of book clasps. In the same year they paid six shillings\r\nfor a _Decretal_ and two shillings for a _Speculum Gregor._ In 1329,\r\nthe Precentor received six shillings and seven pence with which he\r\nwas instructed to go to Balsham to purchase books. In the same year,\r\nfour shillings were paid for twelve iron chains (used, of course, for\r\nfastening the books safely to the reading-desks). Between 1350 and\r\n1356, the purchases appear to have included no less than seventy dozen\r\nsheets of parchment and thirty dozen sheets of vellum.[237]\r\n\r\nPrince Borwin, of Rostock, in 1240 presented the monastery of Dargun\r\nwith a hide of land, the proceeds of which were to be used for the\r\nrepairing and preservation of the books in the library.[238] Adam,\r\ntreasurer of the Chapter of Rennes, in 1231, presented his library to\r\nthe abbey of Penfont, with the condition that the books were never\r\nto be diverted from the abbey, and that copies were to be lent only\r\nagainst adequate pledges.\r\n\r\nIn 1345, a library was founded in the House of the German Brothers\r\nof Beuggen, near Rheinfelden, through the exertions of Wulfram of\r\nNellenberg. He directed that all books left by deceased Brothers\r\nthroughout Elsass were to be brought to this library, and the living\r\nBrothers were also earnestly urged to present their own books to the\r\nsame collection.[239]\r\n\r\nThe great library of the monastery of Admunt was catalogued in 1380\r\nby Brother Peter of Arbonne. The Chapter of S. Pancras, in Leyden,\r\nreceived in 1380, through a bequest of Philip of Leyden, a collection\r\nof eighty manuscripts, the catalogue of which has been preserved.[240]\r\n\r\nAs before indicated, the Monastery Reform, which was instituted with\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century, exercised a very decided\r\ninfluence upon the interest in books and upon the development of\r\nlibraries. In Tegernsee, where the once noted library had fallen into\r\nruins, the Abbot Casper (1426-1461) reorganised it, restored such of\r\nthe old manuscripts as were still in existence, bought new codices,\r\nand put to work a number of hired scribes. His successor, Conrad V.,\r\ncarried on the work actively and purchased for the sum of eleven\r\nhundred pounds heller no less than 450 volumes, in addition to which he\r\nsecured a number of gifts or devout presents.[241]\r\n\r\nIn Salzburg, the Archbishop Johann II. (1429-1441) caused a new\r\nlibrary building to be erected, and collected for it many beautiful\r\nmanuscripts. In the monastery of Bergen, near Magdeburg, the Abbot\r\nBursfelder (1450-1478) organised a library, and utilised for his\r\nbooks an old chapel. In 1477, the Prior Martin instituted a library\r\nin Bordesholm, and Brother Liborius, who was a professor in Rostock,\r\ngave over, in 1405, to this library, for the good of his soul, his\r\nworks on jurisprudence, with the provision that they were to be placed\r\nin chains and to remain forever in the reading-room. A catalogue of\r\nthis collection, which was prepared in 1498, and which contains more\r\nthan five hundred titles, has been preserved.[242] The library of\r\nthe Benedictine monastery of St. Ulrich, near Augsburg, retained its\r\nearly importance until the invention of printing, and in 1472, as\r\nbefore mentioned, a printing office was instituted in connection with\r\nthe monastery, by the Abbot and the Chapter, in which active work was\r\ncarried on. Abbot Trithemius presented to the monastery of Sponheim,\r\nin 1480, the sum of fifteen hundred ducats for the enlargement of its\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the Brothers of Common Life planned their collections\r\nof books expressly with reference to the service of the students\r\nin their schools, and these libraries contained, therefore, a much\r\nlarger proportion of books in the vernacular than were to be found in\r\nother monasteries. In some of the Brotherhood Homes, the library was\r\ndivided into the collection for the Brothers and the collection for\r\nthe students. It was ordered that at least once a year all books that\r\nwere not out on loan should be called in and should be inspected in the\r\npresence of the Brothers.\r\n\r\n=Public Libraries.=--Of the libraries of antiquity, only a single\r\none, and that the latest in foundation, the Imperial Library of\r\nConstantinople, continued in existence as late as the Middle Ages.\r\nThis library, founded in 354 by the Emperor Constantius, was largely\r\nadded to by Julian the Philosopher. Under the Emperor Basiliscus, the\r\noriginal library, which at that time was said to have contained no\r\nless than 120,000 volumes, was destroyed by fire. It was afterwards\r\nreinstituted by the Emperor Zeno, the prefect of the city, Julian,\r\nhaving given to the work his personal supervision. References are made\r\nto this library in 1276, and again early in the fourteenth century,\r\nwhen John Palæologus was able to present from it certain manuscripts\r\n(probably duplicates) to the well known manuscript dealer Aurispa of\r\nVenice. It is probable that the manuscripts of the imperial collection\r\nhad been to some extent scattered before the fall of the city in 1453.\r\nSuch manuscripts as had escaped destruction during the confusion of\r\nthe siege of the city were hidden away by the scholars interested, in\r\nvarious monasteries and in out-of-the-way corners, from which they were\r\nbrought out by degrees during the following two or three centuries.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of these manuscripts found their way, however, very\r\npromptly to Italy, chiefly through Venice, and, as is described in\r\nanother chapter, not a few of the Greek scholars who were driven from\r\nthe Byzantine territories, or who refused to live under the rule of the\r\nTurk, brought with them into Italy, as their sole valuable possessions,\r\ncollections of manuscripts, more or less important, which they used\r\neither as texts for their lectures or for transcribing for sale.\r\n\r\nThe collections in the monasteries of the West, brought together in the\r\nfirst place simply for the requirements of the monks and restricted\r\n(at least in theory) to devotional or doctrinal books, were, in large\r\nmeasure at least, placed at the disposal of scholars and readers\r\noutside of the monasteries, as the interest in literature came to\r\nextend beyond the class of ecclesiastics. With this extension of the\r\nuse of the libraries, there came a natural development in the range of\r\nthe books collected.\r\n\r\nLong after the monks or ecclesiastics had ceased to exercise any\r\ncontrol over the books or to be themselves the only readers interested\r\nin their preservation and use, the most convenient space for the\r\ncollection was to be found in the church buildings. Many of the\r\ncollections came, in fact, to be known as cathedral libraries.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, books or money for the purchase of books was\r\nbequeathed in trust to ecclesiastical authorities with the direct\r\npurpose of providing a library for the use of the general public. The\r\ncathedral Prior of Vercelli (in Piedmont), Jacob Carnarius, who died in\r\n1234, left his books to the Dominicans of S. Paul. He made it, however,\r\na condition of the bequest that under proper security of deposit or\r\npledge, the books should be placed at the disposal of any scholars\r\ndesiring their use, and particularly of instructors in the Theological\r\nFaculty of the University of Vercelli.\r\n\r\nPetrarch’s library was bequeathed in 1362 to the Church of S. Mark\r\nin Venice, with the condition that the collection was to be for the\r\nuse of the general public. The books were neglected, and for some time\r\ndisappeared altogether, and it was only in 1635 that a portion of them\r\nwere recovered. The famous library of S. Mark dates from 1468, when\r\nCardinal Bessarion presented to the city eight hundred manuscripts,\r\nassigning as his reason for the gift the generous hospitality extended\r\nby Venice to the refugees from Constantinople. These books were to be\r\nfor the use of any qualified citizens of the city, a pledge of double\r\nthe value being deposited for any manuscript borrowed. The library\r\nof Boccaccio, who died in 1375, was bequeathed to the monks of the\r\nHoly Ghost in Florence. This library was afterwards added to by the\r\ncollection of the famous theologian, Luigi Marsigli, and that of\r\nNiccolo Niccoli.[243]\r\n\r\nTo Florence, which stood at the front of the intellectual development\r\nof Italy, belongs the credit of instituting the largest and most\r\nimportant of the earlier public libraries of Italy. Niccolo Niccoli,\r\none of the most energetic of the scholarly book collectors, specified\r\nin his will, made in 1430, that his manuscripts should be placed in\r\nthe Camal-dulensian monastery of S. Maria, where his friend Traversari\r\nwas prior, and that these manuscripts were to be available for public\r\nuse. In 1437, however, the day before his death, he added a codicil\r\nto his will, under which the decision as to the abiding-place for his\r\nmanuscripts was left to sixteen trustees.\r\n\r\nHe died in debt, however, and the books would have been seized by his\r\ncreditors if they had not been redeemed by Cosimo de’ Medici. Cosimo\r\nplaced them in the Dominican monastery of S. Mark, the collection in\r\nwhich, in 1444, comprised four hundred Latin and Greek manuscripts.\r\nCosimo gave much care to the further development of this collection. As\r\nhas already been mentioned, he used for the purpose the services of\r\nthe great manuscript dealer, Vespasiano. After the earthquake of 1453,\r\nhe caused the library building to be restored with greater magnificence\r\nthan before. The care of the library was continued, after the death\r\nof Cosimo, by his son Pietro, and the collection finally became the\r\nfoundation of the famous Laurentian library, which is in existence\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nPietro took pains to send the Greek grammarian, Laskaris, twice to the\r\nOrient to collect further manuscripts. From his first journey, Laskaris\r\nbrought back no less than two hundred works, of which eighty had not\r\nheretofore been known in Italy. On his second journey, Laskaris died.\r\n\r\nThe library suffered much during the invasion of Charles VIII., but a\r\nlarge proportion of the books were redeemed from the French invaders by\r\nthe Dominican monks, who paid for them three thousand gulden.\r\n\r\nCardinal Giovanni de’ Medici (later Pope Leo X.) took the collection\r\nfrom the monastery with him to Rome, but it was afterwards returned to\r\nFlorence by Pope Clemens VII.\r\n\r\nClemens gave to Michel Angelo the commission to build a hall for\r\nthe library, but both Pope and architect died before the work was\r\ncompleted, and the building took shape only finally in 1571, the plan\r\nof Michel Angelo having been carried out in substance.\r\n\r\nThe library of the Vatican passed through various vicissitudes\r\naccording to the interest or the lack of interest of the successive\r\npopes, but under Pope Nicholas V. (1447-1455) it became one of the\r\nmost important collections in the world for the use of scholars. In\r\n1471, Sixtus IV. completed the library building and the rooms for the\r\narchives and added many works, and it was under this Pope that the use\r\nof the books was thrown open (under certain conditions) to the general\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nFrederick, Duke of Urbino, is reported to have spent as much as\r\n40,000 ducats on the ducal collection in Urbino, and Vespasiano\r\nrendered important services in the selection and development of this\r\nlibrary. The books were, in 1657, under the papacy of Alexander VII.,\r\ntransferred to the Vatican.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there was very\r\nconsiderable interest in literary work in Hungary and some noteworthy\r\ncollections of manuscripts were there brought together. The collectors\r\nin Italy found in fact some of their richest treasures, particularly\r\nin manuscripts in Greek, in the monasteries of Hungary and of\r\nTransylvania. The cause of literature was much furthered by King\r\nMatthias Corvinus, who brought together a very valuable collection\r\nin Ofen. He kept four scribes in Florence preparing works for the\r\nOfen library, and thirty were continually at work in Ofen itself. His\r\nwife, Beatrix, who was a daughter of King Ferdinand of Naples, and\r\na grand-daughter of Alfonso the Good, is said to have exercised no\r\nlittle influence upon the literary culture of the Hungarian Court. At\r\nher instance, many Italian scholars were brought to Hungary, and their\r\naid utilised in completing the library. The _codices Budences_ came to\r\nbe well known in the scholarly world, and secured fame both for the\r\nbeauty of their script and the richness of their adornment. Wattenbach\r\nsays of these, however, that their text is very largely inaccurate,\r\ngiving the impression that the transcripts had been prepared hurriedly\r\nand to order. After the death of King Matthias, a number of his books\r\ncame into the possession of Emperor Maximilian, who used them for the\r\nfoundation of the Court Library of Vienna. This was the only portion\r\nof the original Hungarian collection which escaped destruction at the\r\nhands of the Turks.\r\n\r\nAmong the public libraries in France is to be noted that of Louis\r\nIX., which was open for the use of scholars, but which, being limited\r\nalmost entirely to devotional books, could not have been of any great\r\nscholarly service. In the middle of the thirteenth century, Richard de\r\nFurnival, chancellor of the Cathedral of Amiens, instituted a public\r\nlibrary, and himself wrote, as a guide for the same, a work entitled\r\n_Biblionomia_.\r\n\r\nThe libraries of S. Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg have already been\r\nreferred to.[244]\r\n\r\nAccording to Savigny, there were before the time of printing no\r\nuniversity libraries in Italy. The _stationarii_ provided both\r\ninstructors and students with such books as were prescribed in the\r\ncourses, and the demand for others appears not to have been great. In\r\nParis, on the other hand, a collection of books for the use of the\r\nstudents was instituted as early as 1270, the first benefactor being\r\nStephen, Archdeacon of Canterbury. Stephen gave his books to the church\r\nof Notre Dame to be loaned to poor students of theology. In 1297, Peter\r\nof Joigny, in continuation of the same work, gave a collection of books\r\nin trust to the university directly for the use of these poor students\r\nof theology. The famous College of the Sorbonne probably dates from\r\n1253. The _librarium_ of the college was instituted in 1289, and it was\r\nspecified that the books were for the common use of the instructors and\r\nstudents. The catalogue of this collection, prepared in the following\r\nyear, is still in existence and contains 1017 titles.[245]\r\n\r\nEach _socius_ of the college had a key to the library rooms and was\r\npermitted to take guests in with him. The books were all fastened\r\nto the wall or to the reading-desks by chains, so that the risk of\r\nabstraction was not a serious one. The statutes of 1321 prescribed that\r\nof every work issued, one copy in the best form must be preserved for\r\nthe Sorbonne collection. This is probably the first statute of the kind\r\nhaving in view the preservation, in a public collection, of copies of\r\nall works produced. It is to be borne in mind, however, in the first\r\nplace, that it could have had reference only to books produced under\r\nthe direct supervision of the college, and secondly, that there was\r\nhere no question of original literary production, but merely of copies\r\nof the older works accepted as possessing doctrinal authority. The\r\nbooks in this library (and probably in other similar libraries) which\r\nwere not protected by chains were called _libri vagantes_, and these\r\ncould, under certain restrictions, be loaned out. Wattenbach is of\r\nopinion, however, that no books other than duplicates were placed in\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nAnother library of importance was contained in the College of Narbonne,\r\nwhich had been founded in 1316, and which was itself a continuation of\r\nan earlier foundation instituted in 1238 by the Archbishop Peter, at\r\nthe time he was about to take part in the Crusade. The books were to be\r\nopen for the use of students as well in Paris as of Narbonne.[246]\r\n\r\nIn the College of Plessis, the statutes of 1455 described that all\r\nbooks, with the exception of the Missals, must be chained, and that no\r\nunchaining should be permitted except with the authorisation of the\r\nmaster of all the bursars. In the College of the Scots, the loaning of\r\nbooks outside of the building was absolutely forbidden.\r\n\r\nTo the College of the Sorbonne belongs the credit of taking the\r\ninitiative step in inviting the first printers to Paris. In 1469, the\r\nprior and the librarian made themselves responsible for finding work\r\nand support for two printers, called to Paris from Mayence. The fact\r\nthat the Prior Johann Heynlin was himself a German was doubtless of\r\ninfluence in bringing to the college early information concerning the\r\nimportance of the new art.[247] The first book which was printed in\r\nParis was the letters of Gasparin of Bergamo, which appeared in 1470\r\n(twenty years after the perfecting of the Gutenberg press), and bore\r\nthe imprint _in ædibus Sorbonnæ_.\r\n\r\nIn England, the foundation of the Franciscans in Oxford took,\r\nearly in the thirteenth century, active part in furthering library\r\nfacilities for the clerics and the students. They appear to have had\r\ntwo collections, one called _libraria conventus_, doubtless restricted\r\nto theological and religious books, and one described as _libraria\r\nscholarium_ or _studentium_, which contained a number of examples of\r\nthe classics. It was to the Franciscans that Bishop Grosseteste, who\r\ndied in 1253, bequeathed all his books.\r\n\r\nThe interest in literature of Richard de Bury, the friend of Petrarch,\r\nhas already been referred to. He was the instructor of King Edward\r\nIII., and exercised later, important official responsibilities. He\r\nserved as a foreign representative more than once, and was for a\r\ntime chancellor of the kingdom. At the time of his death in 1345, he\r\nwas Bishop of Durham. He had a passion for the collecting of books,\r\nand with the exceptional advantages of wealth, official station, and\r\nknowledge of distant countries, he had advantages in this pursuit\r\npossessed by no other Englishman of the time. It is said that the other\r\nrooms in his house having already been crowded with books, these were\r\nmassed in his bedroom also in such quantities that he could get to his\r\nbed only by stepping upon them. His library was bequeathed to Durham\r\nCollege in Oxford, which had been founded by himself. The college was\r\ndiscontinued by Henry VIII., and the books were scattered, not even\r\nthe catalogue, which Bury had himself prepared, having been preserved.\r\nIn confiding his books to Oxford for the use of the students, Richard\r\ngives various earnest injunctions as to the proper respect in which\r\nthey should be held and the care with which they should be handled. A\r\nreader who should handle the books with dirty hands or while eating\r\nor drinking, could, in Bury’s opinion, be fitly punished with nothing\r\nless than banishment. The collection of Durham College was to be open\r\nnot only to the use of the members of the college itself, but of all\r\nmasters and students in Oxford, but no books of which there were no\r\nduplicates were to be taken out of the building.\r\n\r\nThe earliest university library of Germany was that of the College\r\nCarolinum in Prague, instituted by Charles IV. The next in date appears\r\nto have been that of Heidelberg, where as early as 1386 the Faculty of\r\nArts had a library for itself in addition to the general collection\r\nbelonging to the university. As before stated, there was also a\r\ncollection in the Castle which was open for the use of all readers,\r\nstudents, citizens, or strangers. The university library in Vienna\r\ndates from 1415, and that in Erfurt from 1433. The town library in\r\nLeipzig had for its origin a collection possessed by the Augustinian\r\nmonks in the monastery of S. Thomas, which collection was thrown open\r\nfor the use of the public in 1445. Additions to the library were to\r\nbe made only under the inspection and supervision of the monastery\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy library which had no connection with any university\r\nwas instituted at Alzei (in Hesse Cassel) in 1409. Its founders were\r\nJohannes of Kirchdorf, Prebendary of the Cathedral of Worms and\r\nchaplain of King Rupert.\r\n\r\nThe books were given in order that the clerics and other scholarly\r\npeople who belonged to the city of Alzei “could use the same for\r\nentertainment and instruction, and could spread among the community at\r\nlarge the learning contained therein.”[248]\r\n\r\nIn Hamburg there was, as early as 1469, a collection comprising\r\nforty volumes of medical books, for the use more particularly of the\r\ncity physician and his assistant, and also for general reference. In\r\n1480 the burgermeister Neuermeister left a considerable legacy for\r\nthe foundation of a city library. In Frankfort, the library of the\r\nCarmelite monastery was taken over in 1477 for the use of the city, in\r\norder that the “books could be made of service for the enlightenment of\r\nthe community to the greater glory of God and of the Mother of God.”\r\n\r\n=Collections by Individuals.=--Among the laity (outside, at least, of\r\nItaly) it was particularly the kings who from time to time interested\r\nthemselves in collecting books. Pepin received from Pope Paul I., at\r\nhis own urgent request, a collection of books which included certain\r\nGreek manuscripts. The latter could, however, hardly have been of\r\nany particular service either to the King or to any members of his\r\nCourt.[249]\r\n\r\nThe collection formed by Charlemagne has already been referred to,\r\nand also the provision of his will, under which, after his death, the\r\nbooks were to be sold and the proceeds given to the poor. Charles\r\nthe Bald, with whose name it is not easy to associate intellectual\r\nactivity, appears to have been a great collector of books. After his\r\ndeath his library was, under his directions, divided between St. Denis,\r\nCompiègne, and his son.[250] It is recorded of William the Great of\r\nAquitaine, who died in 1030, and who was the father of the Empress\r\nAgnes, that “he had many books and read zealously therein.”[251] Count\r\nBaldwin of Guines, who died in 1205, brought together a collection of\r\nbooks which he had translated into the Romance tongue. Louis IX. of\r\nFrance was interested in the idea of bringing together a collection of\r\ndevout books, and, although he did not live to carry out his plan, the\r\nmanuscripts which were left by him served for the scholar Vincennes of\r\nBeauvais in the preparation of his great encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nLouis heard, during his crusade, of some sultan who had caused to\r\nbe prepared transcripts of all the noted works of philosophy. This\r\nexample incited the zeal of Louis, who gave directions that all the\r\n“authentic, useful, and devout books” which were to be found within his\r\nrealm were to be transcribed, and the transcripts placed in the Royal\r\nLibrary. The collection was, however, not allowed to remain complete,\r\nas in his will Louis directed that the books should be divided between\r\nthe preacher monks and the Minorites of Paris, the Abbey Royaumont, and\r\nthe Dominican monks of Compiègne.[252]\r\n\r\nJohn, Duke of Berry, son of the Good King John, and brother of King\r\nCharles V., found opportunity, even during the troublous times which\r\nculminated with the battle of Poitiers and the imprisonment of his\r\nfather, to bring together a noteworthy collection of books. It was\r\nthis collection that made the beginning of the library of the Louvre,\r\ninstituted by Charles V., a library for which Gilles Mallet prepared in\r\n1373 a very complete catalogue. Barrois published in 1830, in Paris, a\r\nwork devoted entirely to a description of the books collected by Prince\r\nJohn and his brother Charles.\r\n\r\nDavid Aubert, whose translation of the _History of the Emperors_\r\nwas published[253] in 1457, makes, in the preface to this history,\r\nspecial mention of the literary tastes of Philip, Duke of Burgundy.\r\nHe says that Philip made a daily practice of having read to him\r\nancient histories and that he kept employed a great number of skilled\r\ntranslators, learned historians, and capable scribes who were busied in\r\nadding to his great library. This collection of Philip appears later to\r\nhave been scattered as there is no record of its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford found time, between his frequent campaigns,\r\nto interest himself in the collection of manuscripts, and more\r\nparticularly of works which were beautifully illuminated. He purchased,\r\nfor 1200 francs, a portion of the library of Charles V., which had been\r\ncaptured, and, these books being taken to Oxford, finally found place\r\nin the Bodleian collection.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Cleves, who died in 1528 and who was connected with the\r\nBurgundy House, shared the passion of his relatives for magnificent\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of Margaret, Duchess of Brittany, contains the descriptive\r\ntitles of eleven books of devotion and four romances, “all bound in\r\nsatin.”[254]\r\n\r\nThe name of Anne of Brittany, the wife of King Charles VIII., and later\r\nof Louis XII., has long been famous in connection with her fondness for\r\nbooks of devotion and with the great collection which she succeeded in\r\nmaking of these. An inventory of 1498 gives the titles of 1140 books as\r\nbelonging to Anne’s collection.[255]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, it was not until the time of Petrarch that there came to\r\nbe any general interest in the collection of books. This interest\r\nwas naturally associated with the great Humanistic movement of which\r\nit may be considered as partly the cause and partly the effect. The\r\ndevelopment of literary interests in Italy during the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries will be considered in the chapter on the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the collections outside of the monasteries appear to have\r\nbeen less important than in Burgundy and in France, the difference\r\nbeing probably in part due to the narrower cultivation of the German\r\nnoblemen, and probably also in part to their smaller resources. In\r\nfact, the more important collections do not appear to have been in the\r\npossession of the nobility at all, but to have come into existence\r\nthrough the public spirit of citizens of lower degree. The library of\r\ntwo hundred volumes brought together as early as 1260 by Hugo Trimberg,\r\na schoolmaster of St. Gangolf, has already been referred to.\r\n\r\nDuke Ludwig of Brieg is described as having had as early as 1360 a\r\nconsiderable collection of books, and as having had written, in 1353,\r\nby some scribe whose name has not been preserved, the Hedwig legends.\r\n\r\nThe Electors of the Palatinate interested themselves in the formation\r\nof libraries, having possibly been influenced to some extent by their\r\nrelations with their neighbours on the other side of the Rhine. Authors\r\nsuch as Matthias of Kemnat and Michel Behaim worked at the instance of\r\nthe Electors and under pay from them. The books of Kemnat and Behaim\r\nwere either originally written in German, or were promptly translated\r\ninto German for the use of the Electors and of their wives. A number of\r\nbooks in this series are also ornamented with pictures, but, according\r\nto the descriptions, the art work in these illustrations was much\r\ninferior to that done at the same time in Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe most important group of the Heidelberg manuscripts was collected\r\nby Ludwig III., who died in 1437.[256] His daughter Mechthild, whose\r\nfirst husband was the Count Ludwig of Wurtemberg, and whose second, the\r\nArchduke Albrich, retained in her widowhood in her castle at Rotenburg\r\na collection of ninety-four volumes of the mediæval poets, whose works\r\nwere written in the vernacular.[257] Ulbrich of Rappoldstein kept two\r\nscribes engaged for five years in transcribing the _Parsival_, and the\r\ncost of the work amounted to £200.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the preceding sketch that the development of\r\nliterature and the circulation of books during the Middle Ages were\r\nconsiderable, notwithstanding the serious difficulties there were to\r\ncontend with during the ten centuries between the fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire of the West and the time of the invention of printing.\r\n\r\nUnder the “Peace of the World” secured by the imperial rule, there had\r\ncome to be an active literary production and a development of literary\r\ninterests throughout the community which called for a wide distribution\r\nand a general use of books. There was available for the use of\r\npublishers a great list of accepted classics, Greek and Latin, and\r\nthere were also various epochs during which there came into existence\r\nworks by contemporary writers of distinctive importance, many of which\r\nhave been preserved as classics for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe publishers of this period had a convenient and inexpensive material\r\nto use for the making of books, and they had available for book\r\nproduction the labour of skilled and inexpensive scribes,--chiefly\r\nslaves. The well established means of communication throughout the\r\nEmpire enabled the publishers of Rome and Massilia and other literary\r\ncentres to keep open connections with cities in the farthest districts\r\nof the realm, and there is adequate evidence of a well organised trade\r\nin the distribution of books over almost the entire civilised world,\r\na trade which continued active until the latter part of the fourth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Empire of the West and with the destruction of\r\nso much of the civilised organisation and machinery which had been\r\ndependent upon Roman rule, the book trade, or, at least, the trade\r\noutside of Italy, practically disappeared. There remained, however,\r\nwith certain classes a knowledge of the classics and an interest in\r\ntheir preservation, and there remained also in the monasteries the\r\nknowledge and practice of writing and the collections of the works of\r\nthe early Church Fathers, the multiplication of which, for the use of\r\nthe increasing number of priests, called for continued labour on the\r\npart of the clerical scribes.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of writing came to be instituted, particularly in the\r\nBenedictine Order, as a part of the regular routine of the life of\r\na properly ordered monastery, and when such work came to be accepted\r\nas a part of the daily or weekly services rendered by the monks,\r\nthe preservation of the art of writing and the preservation of the\r\nmanuscripts, the existence of which depended upon this continued\r\nknowledge, were assured.\r\n\r\nFor centuries after 476, such literary vitality as there was depended\r\npractically upon these Benedictine monasteries. After the tenth\r\ncentury, we find a wider literary interest throughout the community,\r\nand in certain Courts and circles of nobility, literature began to be\r\naccepted as fashionable, and an interest in literature to be accepted\r\nas part of the proper outfit of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe second stage, therefore, in the development of the interest in\r\nbooks which secured the multiplication of enough copies of many of the\r\nolder books to prevent them from passing out of existence, was in the\r\nformation of the collections by princes and nobles, collections which\r\nwere, as we have noted, usually under the charge of clerical scribes.\r\n\r\nThe third and more important stage of development came with the\r\nrecognition, on the part of the newly founded universities of Bologna,\r\nParis, Prague, Heidelberg, and Oxford, of the fact that the work of\r\nhigher education required the use of collections of books for the\r\nreference of instructors and for the direct use of the students.\r\nWith the instituting in the universities of a class of scribes\r\n(_stationarii_, _librarii_) recognised as university officials, a\r\nrecognition which carried with it certain privileges and protection,\r\nand which went far to offset the hampering restrictions of university\r\nand ecclesiastical supervision, the book production of Europe took a\r\nmore assured form.\r\n\r\nThe fourth step in the extension of literary interests was taken by the\r\ntowns-people, partly at the instance of priests who were themselves\r\nsprung from the people, and partly under the influence of students\r\nreturning from university work to their native towns; and collections\r\nof books were made for the use of the towns-people, while libraries,\r\noriginally planned only for the work of the monasteries and for the use\r\nof clerics, were thrown open to students generally. There appear to\r\nhave been in the manuscript period and in the earlier ages of printing\r\na larger number of such town libraries and a larger extent of literary\r\ninterest among the citizen class in Germany than in either France or\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the development of literary interests and of literary\r\nproduction worked from an early date much more outside of church\r\norganisations than was the case either in Germany or in France.\r\n\r\nIn such centres of literary activity as Florence, Milan, Padua, Rome,\r\nand later, Venice, the production of the classics and the multiplying\r\nof the books of the Italian writers themselves was carried on at\r\nthe instance and to a large extent with the money of the wealthier\r\ncitizens, citizens who in many cases held no official positions\r\nwhatever. The intellectual life of Italy was, however, from an early\r\ndate, very largely influenced by the thought and the learning that\r\ncame to it from the Greeks of Constantinople, an influence which was\r\nincreasing in importance for a quarter of a century before the fall\r\nof the Greek Empire, and which, after 1453, was naturally still more\r\nextended and emphasised by the large immigration of Greek scholars\r\nflying from Turkish rule and bringing with them the literary treasures\r\nof the East. It was this invasion of Greek thought and the restoration\r\nof the knowledge of the poetry and philosophy of classic Greece, which\r\ngave the immediate impetus to the great intellectual movement known as\r\nthe Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAs the Renaissance movement took hold of the imagination of Italian\r\nscholars, it found ready for its use the new invention of printing, and\r\nthrough the presses of Aldus and his associates, the thought of the\r\nOld World, reshaped with the knowledge of the fifteenth century, gave a\r\nfresh inspiration to the intellectual life of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, where the Renaissance movement also influenced the\r\nintellectual life of the time, a more important impetus to the\r\nintellectual activity came with the work of the Reformation. The\r\nprinting-press made the teachings of Luther and his associates\r\navailable for the widest popular distribution, and the towns-people\r\nand villagers who bought from the book peddlers the tracts containing\r\nthe vigorous statements of the Reformers, and who bought also the\r\nanswering arguments of the defenders of the Roman Church, were not\r\nmerely wrestling with a religious or theological issue, but were\r\nfurthering the general education of the community and were helping to\r\nlay the foundation of the book trade of the future. From the earliest\r\ndate of the printing-press, it was the case that there was in Germany\r\na larger distribution of books, printed in the vernacular, among what\r\none may call (for purposes of classification) the lower orders of the\r\ncommunity, than was the case in either Italy, France, or Germany. The\r\ndevelopment of the relation between literature and the community, which\r\ncame after the establishment of the new art of printing, belongs,\r\nhowever, to a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF BOOKS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first revival of the long slumbering trade in manuscripts took\r\nplace in Italy, the cradle of the universities. Although after the\r\nbreaking down of the old civilisation of the Western Empire, Italy had\r\nsuffered more through invasions and devastations than any other country\r\nof Europe, it had nevertheless succeeded in preserving a certain\r\ncontinuity of cultivation and some remnants of learning or germs of\r\nintellectual life, from which germs there came again into growth an\r\nintellectual development for Europe. For the purposes of this study,\r\nI am concerned with the history of the early universities of Europe\r\nonly in connection with their relations to the production of books. I\r\npropose, therefore, to give a brief description of the organisation\r\nand the character of the book-trade that came into existence in one or\r\ntwo of the representative university towns, with some reference to the\r\ngeneral influence of the first universities upon the development and\r\nthe distribution of literature.\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated in the introductory chapter, it is my\r\nunderstanding that, with the beginning of the thirteenth century,\r\nthe responsibility for the preservation and the development of the\r\nintellectual life of Europe, for the mental training of the increasing\r\nproportion of the community which was conscious of intellectual\r\nexistence, and for the transmission to the existing generations of\r\nwhat had been preserved of the thought and learning of the past, was\r\ntransferred from the monasteries and the ecclesiastical schools to the\r\nnewly organised universities.\r\n\r\nThis change meant among other things that the control and direction\r\nof education no longer rested with the ecclesiastics, that the class\r\nof scholars was no longer limited to the clerics, and that there were\r\nother directions in which scholarly achievement was to be sought\r\nthan those heretofore marked out by the Church. I do not mean to say\r\nthat after the beginning of the thirteenth century, when the schools\r\nof Bologna and Paris had developed into universities, the Church\r\nconsciously abandoned the control of education, a control which had\r\nrested in its hands for eight centuries. The representatives of the\r\nChurch authority themselves took an important part in bringing into\r\nexistence not a few of the universities, and in connection with the\r\norganisation of the theological Faculties and in other ways, the popes\r\nand the bishops retained for a long series of years an important\r\nand abiding influence over much of the university work. Heretical\r\ndoctrines, or what Rome believed to be heretical doctrines, were taught\r\nnot infrequently in university lecture-rooms, but the authority on the\r\npart of the Church to interfere with such teaching, and to secure the\r\nwithdrawal of the license from the lecturer, was continually claimed\r\nand was frequently enforced. The fact remained, however, that the\r\ngeneral direction and control of the work of higher education rested no\r\nlonger with ecclesiastics but with laymen. Of the four great divisions\r\nof university instruction, Theology, Philosophy (or Art), Law, and\r\nMedicine, the first remained of necessity under the direction of the\r\nChurch, while in the supervision of the second the Church undertook to\r\nexercise an influence which of necessity varied greatly from time to\r\ntime according to the institution and according also to the character\r\nof the particular popes and bishops. The third and fourth Faculties\r\nwere, however, entirely independent of ecclesiastical influence, and\r\nthe mere fact of the existence outside of the Church of an important\r\ndivision of learning and of a great body of scholars must have had a\r\npowerful effect on the imagination of communities which had for so many\r\ngenerations been accustomed to look to the Church as the source or as\r\nthe interpreter of all knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe principal authorities on the rise and the general history of the\r\nearlier universities are Denifle, Laurie, Mullinger, and Compayré. The\r\ntitles of their several works, on which have in the main been based\r\nsuch statements or conclusions as are expressed in the following pages,\r\nare given in full in the bibliography. The details concerning the\r\nwork of the university scribes and the manuscript dealers are chiefly\r\nderived from the works of Wattenbach and Kirchhoff.[258]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that several centuries before the institution in\r\nChristian Europe of the first of the universities, and at a time when,\r\noutside of a few monastic _scriptoria_, the interest in literature in\r\nChristian states was almost non-existent, in the countries which had\r\naccepted the faith of Mahomet a system of higher education had been\r\neffectively organised, and in connection with the intellectual activity\r\nof the universities and libraries of Bagdad, Alexandria, Cairo, and\r\nCordova, there had been a very considerable production of literature\r\nin the departments of jurisprudence, philosophy, and science. In\r\nfact, the first knowledge that came to the Europe of the Middle Ages\r\nconcerning Greek thought and Greek literature was brought to it through\r\nArabian scholars, and it was by means of the lecturers of Cordova that\r\nthe doctrines of Aristotle were made known to the philosophers of\r\nParis. The list of the scholarly writers who were associated during\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth centuries with the great Arabian schools is a\r\nlong one, and the books produced by them included not a few works which\r\nhad an abiding influence on the thought of Europe. I have, however,\r\nno information concerning the methods employed for the manifolding\r\nand distribution of the books, and a consideration of them does not\r\nproperly find place in this study. The names of Avicenna (d. 1027)\r\nand Averrhoes (d. 1198) will be recognised as representative of the\r\nclass of authors referred to, the men who, by their translations of\r\nHippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, and other Greek classics, recalled what\r\nLaurie calls the university life of the Greeks.[259]\r\n\r\nIn explaining how the universities are to be distinguished from\r\nthe cathedral schools or the Benedictine schools out of which they\r\nwere developed, Laurie gives the following definition of the first\r\nuniversities: “They were _specialised_ schools, as opposed to the\r\nschools of Arts, and they were _open to all_, without restriction, as\r\n_studia publica_ or _generalia_, as opposed to the more restricted\r\necclesiastical schools, which were under a Rule.”[260]\r\n\r\nFor the older institutions, it is not practicable to fix with any\r\nprecision the date of their beginning, and no year can be named in\r\nwhich they first exercised the functions of a university. The first\r\nuniversity that was formally founded was that of Prague, which dates\r\nfrom April, 1348. Bologna, Paris, Padua, Oxford, and Cambridge were\r\nnot founded but grew, that is, were developed under special influences\r\nout of pre-existing schools. The first European school which, while\r\nnever developing into a university, did do specialised university\r\nwork, was that of Salerno, which may be said to have initiated for\r\nEurope systematised and scientific instruction in medicine. _Fons\r\nMedicinæ_ was the name given to it by Petrarch. The school of Salerno\r\nhas one special claim to commemoration in any general sketch of the\r\nintellectual life of Europe. Its foundation and early development\r\nwere due to the famous Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, the\r\nmonastery which had been established by S. Benedict (in 529), and the\r\n_scriptorium_ in which was the creation of Cassiodorus. Salerno, which\r\nwas later affiliated with the University of Naples, fills, therefore,\r\nthe place of a connecting link between the educational work of the\r\nold-time Benedictine _scriptorium_ and the scientific activities and\r\nintellectual life of the new university system of Europe. Indeed,\r\nthrough that wonderful old man, Cassiodorus, at once Greek, Roman, and\r\nGoth, statesman, author, and monk, the chain of continuity is borne\r\ndirectly back to the classic world of imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nThe study of letters in Monte Cassino had come to include medicine,\r\nand the writings of Galen and Hippocrates were transcribed in the\r\n_scriptorium_, and were later made the first text-books in the medical\r\nschool established by the monks at Salerno. Charlemagne is said to\r\nhave interested himself in the school and in 802 to have ordered\r\ncertain Greek medical treatises to be translated for its use from\r\nthe Arabic into Latin.[261] The man who finally developed the monks’\r\nmedical school (then known as the _civitas Hippocratica_) into a\r\ngreat and specialised _studium publicum_ was, however, Constantine, a\r\nCarthaginian Christian. His work was done between the years of 1065\r\nand 1087, under the special favour and patronage of Robert Guiscard,\r\nwho was at that time ruler of Apulia. In the time of Robert the school\r\ncontained some women students, probably the earliest in Europe.\r\nThere are references also at this period to several female writers\r\non medical subjects. Salerno dates as a privileged school from 1100.\r\nThe University of Naples, with which the medical college of Salerno\r\nwas later affiliated, was instituted by Frederick II. (the “Wonder of\r\nthe World”) in 1224. Notwithstanding the brilliancy of the Court of\r\nFrederick and the feverish energy of the monarch himself, the literary\r\nwork done in his university was not of abiding importance, and it is\r\nBologna which serves as the type of the earlier universities of Europe,\r\nand which divides with the University of Paris the honour of having\r\nserved as a general model for later foundations.\r\n\r\nThe University of Bologna lays claim to be the oldest in Europe.\r\nAccording to one tradition it was founded by Charlemagne about 800,\r\nbut the celebration in 1890 of its thousandth anniversary indicates\r\nthat its modern historians have contented themselves with a somewhat\r\nlater date. The jurist Irnerius, who gave instruction in civil law\r\nin Bologna between 1100 and 1135, was able to do for the school of\r\nlaw a very similar work to that done by Constantine a century earlier\r\nfor the school of medicine at Salerno, and under his direction the\r\nschool became a _studium publicum_ or _generale_. Bologna dates as a\r\nprivileged _studium_ from 1158, when the _Universitas_ secured a formal\r\nrecognition from Frederick I. Tiraboschi speaks of the university\r\nas having been in a flourishing condition as early as the twelfth\r\ncentury, and in 1224, when the Emperor Frederick II., in his zeal on\r\nbehalf of his newly founded university at Naples, undertook to suppress\r\nthat of Bologna, the latter is reported to have had no less than\r\n10,000 students. Its great jurist of that time was Azo or Azolinus.\r\nThe edict was revoked in 1227, and the schools of the university\r\nwere, in fact, never closed. The University of Padua dates from about\r\n1215, and that of Vercelli (in Piedmont) from 1228. In 1248, Innocent\r\nIV. established the University of Piacenza, with privileges similar\r\nto those enjoyed by Paris and Bologna. Pisa dates from about 1340,\r\nFlorence from 1321, and Pavia from 1362. Galeazzo Visconti secured\r\nfor Pavia from Charles IV. a charter with the privileges of Paris,\r\nBologna, and Oxford. Notwithstanding the competition of so many rival\r\ninstitutions, and the special favour shown from time to time to certain\r\nof these by one prince or another (as in the case of the Emperor\r\nFrederick to Naples), Bologna not only retained its pre-eminence among\r\nthe universities of Italy, but secured for itself a great reputation\r\nthroughout Europe, attracting students of every nationality. In\r\nBologna, Padua, and Pavia special attention was given to jurisprudence,\r\nwhile the school of Florence was noted for the liberal remuneration\r\ngranted to its instructors in rhetoric and in belles-lettres. In this\r\nrespect, however, Florence stood almost alone. The instructors in\r\nliterature, classed as Humanists, were obliged for the most part to\r\nseek appreciation and remuneration not in the universities, but at\r\nthe Courts of the cultivated princes and in the palaces of the more\r\nintellectual of the noblemen, and, fortunately for the literary life of\r\nItaly, literature had, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\r\na popularity and acceptance among princes and nobles to an extent not\r\nknown elsewhere in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile the university life of Italy dates from the close of the twelfth\r\ncentury, it is not until the beginning of the thirteenth century\r\nthat we find any trace of regulations concerning the production and\r\ndistribution of manuscripts. It appears that for a term of perhaps a\r\nquarter of a century there had been in Bologna and in the other older\r\nuniversity towns a certain amount of interest in the production,\r\nhiring, and selling of manuscripts, a trade which had been carried on\r\nwithout any supervision or restriction on the part of the university\r\nauthorities, and the same was the case with the work of the earlier\r\nmanuscript dealers in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe term _stationarii_, which first appears in Bologna in 1259 and in\r\nParis some years later, indicates at once a change in the method of\r\nwork of these university scribes as compared with previous writers\r\nwho had been ready to do work in one place or another as opportunity\r\noffered. For a number of years there was, in connection with this\r\nuniversity work, practically no selling of books. The special\r\nresponsibility of the _stationarii_ was to keep in stock a sufficient\r\nnumber of authorised and verified transcripts or copies of the books\r\nordered or recommended in the educational courses of the university,\r\nand to rent these to the students or to the instructors at rates which\r\nwere prescribed by university regulations. The _stationarii_ also\r\ntook over the books of the students who died while in the university,\r\nor of departing students, as in most of the universities it was a\r\nmisdemeanour to carry any books at all out of the university town.\r\n\r\nIn Bologna, Padua, and probably other Italian universities, the Jews\r\nwere forbidden to carry on any trade in books. If, therefore, Jews\r\ncoming into a town had manuscripts which they wished to dispose of,\r\nit was necessary for them to place these manuscripts in the hands of\r\nthe _stationarii_, and they would make sale of them on commission. As\r\nbefore specified, however, the buyers of books in a university town\r\ncould purchase only the use of the books during their sojourn in such\r\ntown. On leaving the town, it was necessary that the books should be\r\nplaced again with the _stationarii_ for sale to others connected with\r\nthe university. It is probable, however, that this regulation applied\r\nonly to the special list of text-books or reference books authorised\r\nand prescribed by the university. A certain Heinrichs of Kirchberg\r\nrelates that on leaving Padua in 1256, he had managed to bring away\r\nwith him a considerable package of books. He had accomplished this\r\nby hiding the books in a load of hay which he took with him through\r\nthe town gates without being discovered.[262] In 1334, the university\r\nregulation was modified so that after having secured the special\r\npermission of the authorities, a student could take with him from the\r\nuniversity books which he had purchased.\r\n\r\nUntil the time when the manuscript traders were replaced by the dealers\r\nin printed books, the most important function of the university dealers\r\nwas not in the sale, but in the hiring out of manuscripts, and the\r\nterm _stationarius_ came from a very early date to be limited to the\r\nfunctionary who, under the regulations of the university, provided,\r\nfor hire, the students, and in some cases the instructors, with the\r\nmaterial required for their work.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the manifolding and prompt distribution of the\r\ntexts needed, and in order also to lessen for the students the cost\r\nof securing these texts, the practice obtained from the beginning\r\nof dividing the manuscripts into portions, to which portions were\r\ngiven the name _peciæ_ or _petiæ_--or in the Italian form, _pezze_.\r\nAt first, the extent of these divisions must have been more or less\r\narbitrary, but later, the number of pages or sheets to be contained in\r\nthem was made a matter of specific university regulation. According\r\nto the regulation, the _pecia_ was to contain sixteen columns, each\r\nwith sixty-two lines, and each line with thirty-two letters, and the\r\nmaterial was to be written on sheets comprising together a form,\r\n_quaterne_.\r\n\r\nThe _pecia_ served as the unit of the calculation for the charge for\r\nthe rental. The older manuscripts had been written in a much larger\r\n_format_ than that found convenient for university work, and the above\r\nspecified form was now arrived at as, on the whole, best meeting the\r\nrequirements of the students and the convenience of the scribes.\r\n\r\nFor some years after the formal recognition by the university statutes\r\nof the _stationarii_, the number of these was naturally limited, a\r\nlimitation which had a service for the university authorities in\r\nfacilitating the supervision considered important, and which was, of\r\ncourse, of business value for the _stationarii_ themselves. A certain\r\namount not only of scholarly knowledge but also of capital must have\r\nbeen requisite on the part of the _stationarii_ in order to bring\r\ntogether for manifolding authentic codices or texts, and also to keep\r\nthemselves supplied with writing materials, which during the thirteenth\r\ncentury continued to be costly. There is evidence that in certain\r\ncases, particularly in Padua, a salary was paid from the university\r\nchest to the _stationarii_, which was an admission on the part of the\r\nuniversity authorities that the prices prescribed for the rent of the\r\n_peciæ_ were not in themselves adequate to secure a living income for\r\nthe scribes.\r\n\r\nThe _stationarii_ were occasionally known in the Italian universities\r\nby the name of _bedelli_, or _bidelli_. The _bedelli_ were originally\r\nuniversity officials, whose functions probably covered some such\r\ndisciplinary work as that which is to-day in the hands of the Oxford\r\nproctors. The name suggests also the English term _beadle_, applied to\r\nthe English parish official who was charged with the duty of keeping\r\nthe peace, and I find that the lexicographers derive the word _beadle_\r\ndirectly from the earlier term _bedel_, the name given to the English\r\nuniversity functionary who had to do with matters of discipline and\r\nparticularly with the direction of public functions, processions,\r\netc. The name is derived from _pedum_, a stick, the allusion being\r\nprobably to the baton or staff of office. The use in Italy of the term\r\n_bidellus_ for the scribes hiring out manuscripts, was evidently due\r\nto the fact that the privileges of this business were in certain cases\r\ngiven to the university officials, in addition, probably, to their\r\nother duties.\r\n\r\nThe name of _peciarii_ was sometimes applied to the officials whose\r\nduty it was to supervise the work of the _stationarii_. In 1300, there\r\nis reference to six _peciarii_ in Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Italian reference to university scribes dates from\r\n1228, and concerns not the University of Bologna, but the smaller\r\ninstitution of Vercelli in Piedmont. The Vercelli regulations order\r\nthe employment of two _exemplatores_, who were to be charged with the\r\nduty of providing the texts required for the use of the instructors and\r\nstudents in the Faculties of jurisprudence and theology. The prices to\r\nbe paid for these manuscripts were to be fixed by the rector of the\r\nuniversity. As this is the earliest regulation of which there is record\r\nconcerning bookselling in the universities, I think it worth while to\r\ncite the text itself:\r\n\r\n_Item habebit Commune Vercellarum duos exemplatores, quibus taliter\r\nprovidebit, quod eos scholares habere possint, qui habeant exemplantia\r\nin utroque jure et in Theologia competentia et correcta tam in textu\r\nquam in glossa; ita quod solutio fiat a scholaribus pro exemplis\r\nsecundum quod convenit, ad taxationem Rectoris._[263]\r\n\r\n[The University of Vercelli shall also employ two _exemplatores_, for\r\nwhom suitable provision shall be made, so that they may be at the\r\nservice of the scholars who require manuscripts authoritative and\r\ncorrect both as to the text and in the commentaries, either in the\r\ndepartment of law or in that of theology, and in return for the copies\r\n(or for the use of the copies) received from the _exemplatores_, the\r\nstudents shall pay a fitting price (or rental) to be fixed by the\r\nRector of the university.]\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion, the statutes of the University of Padua of the year\r\n1283 provide that two _stationarii_ or _bidelli_ should be employed,\r\none of whom should be at the service of the Faculty of jurisprudence,\r\nand the other should serve those of arts and of medicine. The\r\ntheological Faculty was not instituted in Padua until much later. The\r\ntwo _bidelli_ drew salaries, the first of eight ducats per year, and\r\nthe second of two ducats, forty sols. They were charged with the duty\r\nof keeping a supply of _peciæ_ of the texts prescribed in the lists and\r\nof placing these supplies at the disposal of the students and scholars\r\ncalling for the same. In the year 1420, the statutes of the High School\r\nof Modena prescribed that the _stationarius_ (there appears to have\r\nbeen question of but one official for the entire institution) must\r\nkeep a supply of the texts of the Roman and Canonical law, the _summa\r\nnotaria_, the _speculum_, the Lectures of Cinus and of Innocentius.\r\n\r\nThe _stationarius_ was to charge for the rent of a _pecia_ of the\r\nprescribed texts four denarii, of the _glossarii_ five denarii, and\r\nof other texts six denarii. I do not find in the regulations any\r\nspecification of the term covered by this rental. The city was to\r\nassure the _stationarius_ of freedom from military service, and was to\r\ngive him “the yearly compensation of ten lire.”[264]\r\n\r\nA reference by the Italian scholar Filelfo indicates that from this\r\nuniversity arrangement the term _bidellus_ came to be applied to\r\nscribes outside of university towns. Filelfo speaks of a _librarius\r\npublicus_, “who, in the ordinary speech, is called _bidellus_.”\r\n\r\nWith the increase in the larger universities, such as Bologna and\r\nPadua, of the number of students and instructors requiring literary\r\nmaterial, the practice gradually took shape of purchasing instead\r\nof hiring the texts required, and the _stationarii_ developed into\r\n_librarii_. In its original signification, the term _librarius_ stood\r\nfor librarian; and as late as the fourteenth century the French word\r\n_librairie_ was used for a library or a collection of books. It seems\r\nto have been only after the introduction of printing that the use of\r\nthe term _librairie_ finally came to be restricted in France to a\r\ncollection of books held for sale, that is to say, to a book-shop.\r\n\r\nThe book-dealers, who in the earlier years of the manuscript period\r\ndevoted themselves to keeping collections of manuscripts, filled, in\r\nfact, rather the rôle of librarians than of booksellers. They were\r\nready to rent out their manuscripts for a consideration, or to permit\r\ncustomers to consult the texts without taking them from the shop. The\r\npractice of making from their original stock of texts authenticated\r\ncopies for general sale, was a matter of comparatively slow development.\r\n\r\nBologna had become the most important school in Europe for the study of\r\nRoman and Canonical law, and it was in Bologna that the undertakings of\r\nthe university bookseller first became important. The booksellers were\r\nnot only subject to the supervision of the university, but were also\r\nbrought under the regulations of the town, and the town authorities\r\nundertook to prescribe prices as well for the renting as for the\r\nselling of the manuscripts, and also to prescribe penalties for the\r\nrenting or selling of incorrect or incomplete texts.\r\n\r\nThe university regulations specified that there must be on the part of\r\nthe booksellers no modification of the text under which new readings or\r\nglosses should be inserted to replace those accepted as authoritative,\r\nand a penalty was attached to the selling or renting of the texts\r\nin any other form than that in which they were prescribed by the\r\ninstructors of the Faculty to which the study belonged. In 1289, the\r\npenalty for the contravention of this regulation, previously fixed at\r\nten lire, was raised to one hundred lire.[265]\r\n\r\nA few years later, a university regulation specified that the\r\n_stationarii peciarum_ who undertook to rent out the authoritative\r\ntexts, must keep in stock sufficient supplies of 117 specified\r\nworks. In the year 1300, there were in the university six official\r\n_stationarii_, of whom three were Italians and three, foreigners. They\r\nhad to be appointed each year, but it seems probable that when their\r\nwork proved satisfactory they were re-appointed from year to year.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the general supervision of the texts and\r\nfor their correctness and completeness rested with the _bidellus\r\ngeneralis_. Any reader who should discover blemishes or omissions in\r\nthe _peciæ_ was under obligation to report the same to the _bidellus\r\ngeneralis_, and the _stationarius_ who was responsible for the\r\npreparation of the defective text was fined five solidos, one half of\r\nthe fine going to the university chest, one quarter to the _bidellus_,\r\nand one quarter to the informant.\r\n\r\nThe _stationarii_ were ordered to post up in a conspicuous place in\r\ntheir shops all the regulations having to do with their trade, in\r\norder that all buyers could know what they were entitled to receive.\r\nThey were not at liberty to decline to rent to university members any\r\n_peciæ_ on the official list. On the other hand, if they rented out\r\n_peciæ_ to students who had been expelled or who were under suspension,\r\nthey were themselves liable to fine. The usual rental at this time,\r\nthat is to say, the beginning of the thirteenth century, was four\r\n_denarii_ for a _quaterne_ (four sheets) and two _denarii_ for a\r\n_pecia_. The _denarius_ was the equivalent of about ten cents.\r\n\r\nThe rental for works not on the official list was somewhat higher, as\r\nthese would not be called for so continuously and as the preparation\r\nof supplies of the same must, therefore, be more of a speculation. In\r\nrenting manuscripts outside of Bologna (which could be done only under\r\nspecial permission of the university authorities and which occurred\r\nas a rule only with members of other universities) an additional two\r\n_denarii_ for a _quaterne_ could be demanded. Students renting the\r\n_peciæ_ were obliged to deposit a pledge of sufficient value to secure\r\nthe _stationarii_ against loss. Between the regulations applying\r\nto the _stationarii peciarum_, and those controlling the general\r\n_stationarii_, who had authority to sell as well as to rent and whose\r\nbusiness lay outside of the university, there were various differences.\r\nThe general _stationarius_ appeared to have undertaken from time\r\nto time the sale of books on commission, which to the university\r\n_stationarius_ was forbidden.\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier university regulations prohibited students from\r\npurchasing manuscripts with a view of selling them again for a profit,\r\nbut this, according to Savigny, fell into disuse in the course of\r\nthe fourteenth century. As late as 1334, the regulations of Bologna\r\nstrictly prohibited students from taking with them, on leaving the\r\nuniversities, any books whatsoever, without a special authorisation\r\non the part of the heads of their respective Faculties. Regulations\r\nof this kind naturally interfered with the normal development of the\r\nbook trade in a city so largely dependent upon its university as was\r\nBologna, and formed one cause for the greater activity of the general\r\nbook trade in cities like Venice, where the regulations of the commune\r\nwere not supplemented by those of university authorities.\r\n\r\nThe city statutes of Bologna of 1259, prohibited the _stationarii\r\nlibrarii_ from taking a higher commission on the sale of manuscripts\r\nthan two and a half per cent. It was also specified that no sale of a\r\nwork left on commission should be made without the direct knowledge\r\nof the owner. The _stationarius peciarum_ belonged at the outset to\r\nthe membership of the university, and, in accepting the authority\r\nof its supervision and its regulations, enjoyed also the university\r\nprivileges, which included freedom from certain municipal obligations.\r\nMany of the university _stationarii_ belonged, as mentioned, to the\r\nclass of _bidelli_.\r\n\r\nIt was forbidden for any member of the university to promise or to\r\nengage, either directly or indirectly, to pay to the _stationarius_\r\na higher commission or compensation than that prescribed in the\r\nregulations. The penalty for an infraction of this rule, a penalty\r\nimposed upon both the parties concerned, was a fine of five livres.\r\nThe student was also under obligations to denounce to the rector\r\nany attempt on the part of the dealer to secure an additional\r\ncompensation.[266] The very severity of these prohibitions gives\r\nindication of difficulty in securing enforcement of the system.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Padua and of the other Italian universities of the\r\nmanuscript trade, were similar to, and were probably in the main based\r\nupon, those of Bologna. In Padua, the earliest regulations which have\r\nbeen preserved bear date as late as 1465, which is one year later than\r\nthe introduction into Italy of the printing-press. The regulations of\r\n1465 prescribed the size of the _peciæ_ and confirmed the rental prices\r\nto the schedule of those of Bologna. The renting of manuscripts could,\r\nhowever, have continued but for a short period after the issue of these\r\nregulations. In Padua, as in Bologna, the _stationarii peciarum_ had to\r\nmake a deposit, in entering upon their business, of four hundred lire.\r\nThey had also to go through with an examination at the hands of the\r\nuniversity authorities, and they then had to take an oath of loyalty to\r\nthe university. This entitled them to their formal appointment, which\r\nneeded, however, as stated, to be confirmed from year to year.\r\n\r\nIn Padua, as in Bologna, there were fixed commissions for the sale\r\nof manuscripts, and these commissions, in themselves quite moderate,\r\nwere to be paid half by the buyer and half by the seller. It appears,\r\nhowever, that the prices were probably not fully controlled by these\r\nregulations, as there are examples of so-called “presents” being\r\ngiven by buyers to the sellers after the sale of manuscripts on the\r\ncommission basis specified in the regulations had been duly recorded.\r\n\r\nIn Padua, as in Bologna, it was strictly forbidden for Jews to take\r\nany part in the buying and selling of manuscripts. The only way in\r\nwhich a Jew could secure a manuscript desired by him was through the\r\nintervention of the university authorities, who might make purchase\r\nof the same on his behalf. The _bidellus_ was the official usually\r\nemployed for the purpose. It may be assumed that some additional\r\ncommission was here required, and that the Jews had to pay more dearly\r\nfor their university texts than the Christians.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be record of the loaning of manuscripts to\r\nstudents for their own transcribing, although in Paris this evidently\r\nformed an important portion of the manuscript business. In Bologna, as\r\nin Padua, the trade in bookbinding was directly associated with that of\r\nmanuscript selling, and the _ligatori librorum_ carried on their work\r\nin the shops of the _librarii_. In Bologna, the manuscripts were in the\r\nmain devoted to the subjects of the law and scholastic theology, while\r\nin Padua the more important division was medicine.\r\n\r\nThe literary requirements, however, for doctors of law as for doctors\r\nof medicine, must have been at best but moderate. Savigny states that\r\nin the thirteenth century the collection of books belonging to a\r\ndoctor of the law in Bologna rarely comprised more than from four to\r\nsix volumes, and the medical collections were hardly as large. It is\r\nwith the beginning of the fifteenth century that there comes to be a\r\nlarger understanding of the relations of literature to education and a\r\nmaterial increase in the demand in the university towns for supplies of\r\nbooks outside of the texts actually in use in the lecture room.\r\n\r\nCompayré gives the following list of the books required in the ordinary\r\nand in the extraordinary courses of law in Bologna, a list which was,\r\nhe says, practically the same at Montpellier: The several works of the\r\n_Corpus Juris_ of Justinian, comprising the _Codex_ (which dates from\r\n529), the _Digestum Vetus_, the _Infortiatum_, the _Digestum Novum_.\r\nThese were identical with the three parts which the pupils of Irnerius\r\ndistinguished as the _Pandects_ or _Digest_, the _Institutes_, the\r\n_Authenticum_. To these sources of the Roman law were later added the\r\n_Constitutiones_ of Frederick I. and Frederick II., and in Montpellier\r\nthe _Usus Feudorum_, a collection of feudal laws.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of the universities fixed the time within which the\r\nreading of the prescribed books must be completed. Professors were\r\nobliged, in entering upon their duties, to take the following oath:\r\n“I swear to read and to finish reading within the time fixed by the\r\nstatutes, the books or parts of books which have been assigned for\r\nmy lectures.” Severe penalties were inflicted on those whose courses\r\nhad not been completed within the required time.[267] There ought, as\r\na rule, to have been no difficulty in completing the task assigned,\r\nfor each Faculty had, as a rule, only a single work or at most a\r\nsingle author assigned for its consideration. The Faculty of Arts had\r\nAristotle, that of Civil Law the _Corpus Juris_ of Justinian, that\r\nof Common Law the _Decretals_ of Gratian. Compayré suggests that,\r\naccording to the maxim of Seneca, _timeo hominem unius libri_, the\r\nFaculties of the Middle Ages might well have been awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe list of the texts of the medical Faculties was, however, somewhat\r\nmore considerable. The course in Montpellier, where medicine became\r\nstill more important than law, followed in the main that of Salerno.\r\nThe first place was given to Hippocrates and Galen. It is somewhat\r\nsurprising that as late as 1250 the teachings of these old-time\r\npractitioners (whose work was done respectively in the fourth century\r\nB.C. and the second century A.D.) should still have remained the\r\nchief authorities in medical science. Compayré refers to them as the\r\nAristotles of Medicine. In the program of the Faculty of Paris of 1270,\r\nhowever, the names of Hippocrates and Galen do not appear.\r\n\r\nWith the two Greeks were associated the original works of Constantine\r\nand his translations from Rhazes Hali-Abbas, Ysaac, Avicenna,\r\nJohannicus, and other Arabic and Persian writers, and finally the\r\ntreatise of John of St. Amand, and of Nicholas of Salerno. The\r\n_Antidotarium_, or _Book of Antidotes_, known also as the _Book of\r\nMedicaments_, was for some centuries a work of standard reference\r\nand of popular sale. The influence of the Arabs in the instructional\r\nliterature of medicine seems to have been almost as controlling as that\r\nof the Greeks in philosophy and of the Romans in law.\r\n\r\nRabelais, who studied medicine in Montpellier between 1520 and 1530, is\r\nsaid to have been the first among the students who was able to read his\r\nGreek authors in the original instead of in Latin translations.[268]\r\nRabelais found time while in college not only for Greek and medicine,\r\nbut for literature. The first part of the _Pantagruel_ was written\r\nbefore he had secured his final diploma.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the thirteenth century, the number of the books\r\nrequired for use in the university courses had increased to such an\r\nextent that four catalogues were issued, one for each of the four\r\nFaculties--Law, Medicine, Theology, and Arts. The lectures and the\r\ninstruction were given entirely in Latin, which was the only language\r\nthat could have been understood by all of the various nationalities\r\nrepresented, or even by the representatives of the different Italian\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the earliest university was that of Palencia, which was\r\nfounded in 1212. Salamanca, founded a few years later, soon exceeded\r\nPalencia in importance, and, particularly in connection with the work\r\nof its medical Faculty, secured for itself, before the close of the\r\nthirteenth century, a repute throughout Europe. Compayré is of opinion\r\nthat the instruction given in Salamanca, not only in medicine but in\r\nscience generally and in philosophy, was very largely influenced by\r\nthe presence in the peninsula of Moorish scholars. “The philosophy of\r\nAverrhoes and the medicine of Avicenna exerted a manifest influence\r\non the development of studies at Salamanca.”[269] It seems probable,\r\nif this belief is well founded, that the Arabian literature, produced\r\nand manifolded in Cordova, found its way to Salamanca, and through\r\nSalamanca to Salerno, Bologna, and Paris.\r\n\r\nThe formal constitution of the University of Paris dates from 1202.\r\nCertain of its historians, however, claim for its first work as an\r\neducational institution a much earlier date. Crévier, for instance,\r\nsays: “The University of Paris as a school goes back to Alcuin ...\r\nCharlemagne was its founder.”[270] Charlemagne’s practical interest\r\nin education has caused his name to be associated with the schools of\r\nTours, Aachen, Milan, Salerno, Bologna, and Paris. The most recent\r\nwriter on the subject, Compayré, is of opinion that this is an\r\nexaggerated statement. He finds evidence of an unbroken succession of\r\nBenedictine schools, such as those of Rheims, Tours, Angers, Laon,\r\nBec, and others, which had preserved a continuity of educational work\r\nfrom the time of Charlemagne to that of Louis VIII., and which, under\r\nsuch leaders as Lanfranc (1005-1089), and S. Anselm (1033-1109), had\r\ndeveloped and maintained a high degree of intellectual activity. He\r\nconsiders these to have constituted the direct succession to the\r\nschools of the palace of Charlemagne, but he fails to find in them the\r\nprototype of the university system. For Compayré, the actual founder\r\nof the University of Paris was Abelard, who died sixty years before\r\nthe university secured its organisation. It is his contention that it\r\nwas Abelard who, by his learning, his independence of thought, his\r\neloquence, and his mastery over the minds of men, is to be credited\r\nwith the initiation of the great movement from which was to proceed\r\nnot only the University of Paris, but the long series of universities\r\nfor which Paris served as an incentive and the type. It was Abelard,\r\nsays Compayré, who, if not first, at least with the most direct and\r\nfar-reaching influence, introduced dialectics into theology and reason\r\ninto authority, breaking away from the mere passive transmission of\r\nthe beliefs and timid dialectics accepted by the schools of theology,\r\nand thus making possible the development of a true university spirit.\r\n“The method of Abelard is the soul of scholastic philosophy,”[271]\r\nthe philosophy which, until the Renaissance, reigned supreme in the\r\nUniversity of Paris. Abelard’s method, says Père Denifle, is presented\r\nin the book which during several centuries served as the text for\r\ntheological instruction, the _Sentences_ of Peter Lombard, and its\r\ninfluence is also to be noted in that other noteworthy work which\r\nbecame the authority for the schools of common law, the _Decretals_ of\r\nGratian.\r\n\r\nAbelard may be called the first professor of superior instruction. His\r\nwork was certainly begun with _éclat_, for his classes are said to have\r\nnumbered at times no less than five thousand pupils. “First of the\r\nFrench philosophers ... he may justly be considered as the precursor\r\nof Ramus and Descartes, in other words, of the Renaissance and of the\r\nmodern spirit.”[272] Apart from this more far-reaching influence, he\r\nwas able to do for the school of Paris what the jurist Irnerius was,\r\nduring nearly the same years, accomplishing for the school of Bologna,\r\nmaking possible, namely, its development into the university. It was\r\nthrough the work done by Abelard that “the theological school of Paris\r\nbecame the seminary of Christian Europe.”[273] This influence continued\r\nthrough the succeeding centuries in which Paris still remained the\r\ncentre of theological instruction, a result which necessarily had later\r\nan important effect in shaping the character of the earlier issues of\r\nthe Paris Press.\r\n\r\nThe term _University_ is not a synonym of the university of science,\r\nbut simply of the university of teachers and students who composed a\r\ngroup and who instituted association of studies. “In the language\r\nof the Civil Law,” says Malden, “all corporations were called\r\n_Universitates_, as forming one whole out of many individuals.”[274]\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the University of Paris, while differing in certain\r\nimportant details from that of Bologna, was substantially identical\r\nwith the Italian institutions in respect to the privileges conceded to\r\ninstructors and students. In successive enactments or crown edicts,\r\nthe members of the universities of Paris, Montpellier, and Poitiers\r\nwere exempted, not only from the regular national taxes and from\r\nthe town dues (_octroi_), but also from special war taxes. In 1295,\r\nPhilip the Fair decreed that under no pretext could the goods of the\r\nmembers of the universities be taken or their revenues attached.[275]\r\nThe following statute of the University of Padua represented fairly\r\nenough the status of students in all the universities of France and of\r\nItaly: “Students must be considered as citizens in what concerns the\r\nadvantages, but not in that which constitutes the burdens of citizens.”\r\nUnder this same principle, members of the universities were also exempt\r\nfrom military service.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the University of Paris exercised a very direct\r\ncontrol from the outset over all the details of the business of making,\r\nrenting, and selling books. This authority became in Paris a matter of\r\nmuch more immediate importance and abiding influence than in Bologna.\r\nIn the latter, as we have seen, the business of the book-dealers\r\nwas very closely limited to the production of the texts immediately\r\nrequired for the work of the class-room. In Paris, however, in the\r\nmanuscript period, two and a half centuries before the introduction\r\nof the printing-press, the book-trade of the university had become\r\nin great measure the book-trade of the city. During a large part of\r\nthis time, moreover, Paris shared with Florence the position of the\r\ncentre of the intellectual activities of Europe. The scribes and\r\ntheir masters who were manifolding manuscripts in the Latin quarter,\r\nwere not only supplying text-books to the students of the university,\r\nbut were preparing literature for the scholarly readers of Paris, of\r\nFrance, and of Europe. The book-dealers of Paris constituted, however,\r\nfor several centuries, with a few exceptions, a guild organised within\r\nthe university. The members of this guild, the _libraires jurés_, were\r\nmembers of the university, and the operations of the guild were under\r\nthe direct control of the university authorities. This arrangement\r\ngave to the book-dealers material advantages in the possession of\r\nuniversity privileges and in the control of a practical monopoly\r\nof the business of producing books. It involved, however, certain\r\ncorresponding disadvantages. University control meant supervision,\r\ncensorship, restriction, regulation of prices, interference with\r\ntrade facilities, and various hampering conditions which delayed very\r\nseriously, both before and after the introduction of printing, the\r\ndevelopment of the business of making and of circulating books, and, as\r\na result of this, placed not a few obstacles in the way of the literary\r\nand the intellectual development of the community. Chevillier says:\r\n“The book-trade of Paris owes its origin to the university, by which,\r\nunder the approval of the king, it was organised into an association of\r\nmasters. This association was, from the outset, controlled directly by\r\nthe university, from the authorities of which it received its statutes\r\nand regulations, and by which the master _libraires_ were licensed,\r\n_jurés_.”[276]\r\n\r\n“The reproduction of a work of scholarship (to which class belonged of\r\nnecessity the text-books prescribed for the work of the university,)”\r\nremarks Delalain, “called for on the part of the scribe a considerable\r\nmeasure of scholarly knowledge and also for a detailed and careful\r\nsupervision. It was held, therefore, by the university authorities\r\nthat the responsibility properly belonged to them to supervise the\r\nseries of operations by means of which these university texts were\r\nprepared and were circulated. It was essential that the completeness\r\nand the correctness of each copy should be verified, and that these\r\ncopies should be confided to trustworthy persons for their sale or\r\ntheir hire, in order that there should be no risk of inaccuracies in\r\nthe texts themselves or of any unnecessary enhancement of the cost to\r\ninstructors or to students of their purchase or their hire. On this\r\nground, the university of Paris asserted from the beginning of its\r\nhistory the right to control the book-trade of the city, a contention\r\nwhich was confirmed and maintained by all the kings of France after\r\nPhilip Augustus.”[277]\r\n\r\nThe “book-trade” was held to include all the dealers and artisans who\r\nwere concerned with the production and distribution of manuscripts;\r\nthat is, the copyists and their employers, the binders, the\r\nilluminators, the sellers of parchment, and, later, the manufacturers\r\nof paper. While the control of the university was exercised over the\r\nentire book-trade, the interest of the authorities was naturally much\r\nkeener in regard to the divisions having to do with the production\r\nof books than in the work of the booksellers. The matter of chief\r\nimportance, in fact, according to the accepted theory, the sole purpose\r\nfor the existence of the book-trade, was to secure for the members of\r\nthe university a sufficient supply, at a fixed and moderate charge, of\r\ncorrect and complete texts of the prescribed works; while it was also\r\nessential to protect those members from the contamination of heretical\r\nwritings or of heretical comments on books of accepted orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nA regulation of December, 1316, prescribes that no _stationarius_ shall\r\nemploy a copyist until such employee shall have been duly sworn before\r\nthe university, or before the Rector and four _procureurs_, to execute\r\nhis functions faithfully, and, having been accepted as a trustworthy\r\nscribe, shall have had his name inscribed on the official register.\r\n\r\nAs a partial offset to the series of restrictions and limitations under\r\nwhich was carried on the work of these early publishers, it is in order\r\nto specify certain privileges and exemptions enjoyed by them as members\r\nof the university. These included exemption from taxes; exemption\r\nfrom service on the watch or on the city guard; and the privilege\r\nof jurisdiction, commonly known as _committimus_. Under this last,\r\nthey were empowered in suits or cases, civil or personal, and whether\r\nengaged as plaintiffs or defendants, to bring witnesses or other\r\nprincipals before the _Juges Conservateurs_, functionaries charged with\r\nthe maintenance or protection of privileges.[278]\r\n\r\nIssues concerning personal rights arising between the members of\r\nthe university were decided before the tribunal or court of the\r\nRector. Cases affecting realty, and all cases between the members\r\nand outsiders, were tried before the _Conservateurs des Priviléges_,\r\nan authority of necessity favourably disposed to the members of the\r\nuniversity. The ground assigned for this privilege was that instructors\r\nand pupils, and those engaged in aiding their work (_i. e._ the makers\r\nof books), should not be exposed to loss of valuable time by being\r\ncalled away from their work to distant parts.[279] An edict of Philip\r\nAugustus, in 1200, confirmed by S. Louis in 1229, and by Philip the\r\nFair in 1302, directed that the cases of university members be brought\r\nbefore the Bishop of Paris. The university found disadvantages in being\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Bishop (whose censorship later proved\r\nparticularly troublesome for the publishers), and applications were\r\nmade to replace the authority of the ecclesiastical courts with that of\r\nthe royal courts. In 1334, letters-patent of Philip of Valois directed\r\nthe provost of Paris, who was at that time _conservateur_ of the royal\r\nprivileges, to take the university under his special protection, and in\r\n1341 the members of the university were forbidden to enter proceedings\r\nbefore any other authority. In 1361, under an edict of King John, the\r\nmembers of the university were again declared exempt from taxes and\r\nassessments of all kinds (_portes, gabelles, impositions, aides, et\r\nsubsides_). The repetition from reign to reign of certain edicts and\r\nregulations such as the above does not imply that the earlier ones had\r\nbeen recalled, but that they had to some extent fallen into desuetude,\r\nor that attempts had been made to override them.\r\n\r\nBy letters-patent issued in 1369, Charles V. declared that all dealers\r\nin books and makers of books required for the use of “our scholars”\r\nshould be exempt from all taxes, etc. The exemption included binders,\r\nilluminators, parchment-makers, etc. It appears that some abuses had\r\ncrept in under this exemption, as in 1384 it was ordered that no\r\nbook-dealers should be freed from taxes if they carried on for gain any\r\nother occupation.[280]\r\n\r\nThe policy of favouring the production and sale of books by freeing the\r\npublishers and dealers from taxes and other burdens was continued and\r\neven developed after the introduction of printing. The kings, impressed\r\nwith the possibilities of this great discovery, recognised that it was\r\nfor the interest of the realm to free books, printed or written, not\r\nonly from _octroi_ or city duties, but from customs or importation\r\ncharges. Letters-patent of Henry II., dated 1553, read as follows:\r\n_Avons ordonné et ordonnons lesdits livres, escrits ou imprimez, reliez\r\nou non reliez, estre et demeurer exempts desdits droits de traicte\r\nforaine, Domaine forain et haut passage_.[281] This was a more liberal\r\npolicy than at that time prevailed in Italy or in England, or, in\r\nfact, than has as yet been accepted in the nineteenth century by the\r\nUnited States. In order to obtain the advantage of such exemption, the\r\npublishers had to secure from the Rector of the university a passport\r\nor certificate for their packages.\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier regulations of the university affecting the\r\nbook-trade was that under which the supervision of the sale of\r\nparchment was left in the hands of the Rector. This sale was usually\r\nauthorised only at the annual Lendit fair. The dealers, bringing their\r\nparchment, exposed this for inspection. Before any other purchases\r\nwere permitted, the Rector selected the quantity needed for the\r\nuniversity, for which payment was made at a price fixed in advance.\r\nHe then received from the parchment-dealers, for the treasury of the\r\nuniversity, or for the special fund of the book guild, a gratuity which\r\namounted to from two thousand to three thousand francs.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, as in Bologna, during the whole of the thirteenth century\r\nand the first portion of the fourteenth, the principal work of the\r\nuniversity book-dealers was not the selling but the renting of books.\r\nThe regulations concerning the division of manuscripts into chapters or\r\n_peciæ_ were, however, not carried out with the same precision in Paris\r\nas in the Italian universities, nor was it practicable to exercise in\r\nthe larger city, or even within the confines of the Latin Quarter, as\r\nclose a supervision as in Bologna or Padua over the rates for renting\r\nand over the stock of copies kept by the _stationarii_. The general\r\npurpose of the regulations was, however, the same, and the routine of\r\nrenting prices and the general rate of commission on the books sold\r\nwere, as said, matters of university regulation. With a community of\r\nstudents ranging in number from ten thousand to (in the most prosperous\r\ndays of the university) as high as thirty thousand, the monopoly of\r\nsupplying text-books, whether through sale or through renting, must\r\nhave constituted an important business. It was not until some time\r\nafter the introduction of printing that the importance and prospect of\r\nprofit of publishing done outside of the university limits, and freed\r\nfrom a portion of the university restrictions, came to be sufficient\r\nto make it worth while for certain of the more enterprising of the\r\nprinters to give up the trade in text-books and their privileges as\r\n_libraires jurés_ and to establish themselves as independent dealers.\r\n\r\nIn the University of Paris we find in use in the twelfth century, in\r\naddition to the terms _librarii_, _stationarii_, and _petiarii_, the\r\nterm _mangones_. The word _mango_ originally designated a merchant or\r\ndealer, but appears to have carried an implication of untrustworthiness\r\nor slipperiness. It is satisfactory, therefore, to understand that\r\n_mangones_ very speedily went out of use as a name for dealers in\r\nbooks.[282] The _petiarii_ are not mentioned in the statutes of the\r\nuniversity, where they appear to be replaced by the _parcheminii_.[283]\r\n\r\nGuérard interprets the term _stationarius_ as standing first for a\r\nscribe with a fixed location (_un écrivain sédentaire_), as opposed\r\nto a copyist who was prepared to accept work in any place where it\r\ncould be secured. Later, the term was understood to designate a master\r\nscribe who directed the work of a bureau of copyists; and still later,\r\nthe _stationarius_, sometimes then called _stationarius librorum_,\r\npossessed a complete book-making establishment, where were employed,\r\nin addition to the copyists, the illuminators, binders, and other\r\nartisans. At this stage of his development, the _stationarius_ has\r\nbecome the equivalent of the printer-publisher of a later generation.\r\nGuérard is inclined to limit the earlier use in Paris of the term\r\n_librarius_ to the keeper of a shop in which books were kept for sale,\r\nbut in which no book-production was carried on.[284] It is evident,\r\nhowever, that in France, as in Italy, there was no very definite or\r\nconsistent use of the several terms, and that before the introduction\r\nof printing, _librarius_ and _stationarius_ were applied almost\r\nindifferently to dealers having to do either with the production or\r\nwith the sale of books. Chassant is authority for the statement that\r\nat the time of the introduction of printing into France there were in\r\nthe two cities of Paris and Orleans more than ten thousand individual\r\nscribes or copyists who gained their living with their pens.[285] It is\r\nnot surprising that the first printers, whose diabolical invention took\r\nthe bread away from these workers, had their lives threatened and their\r\nwork interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe letters-patent of Charles V., dated November 5, 1368, specify\r\nfourteen _libraires_ and eleven _écrivains_ (employing _stationarii_)\r\nas at that time registered in Paris. No one was admitted to the\r\nprofession of _librarius_ or _stationarius_ who was not a man of\r\napproved standing and character, and who had not also given evidence\r\nof an adequate and scholarly knowledge of manuscript interpretation\r\nand of the subject to which he proposed to give attention. The\r\nexamination was made before the four chief publishers (_les quatre\r\ngrands libraires_). Having secured the approval of the board of\r\npublishers, the applicant was obliged to secure also acceptance from\r\nthe representatives of the Rector, and to submit certain guarantees for\r\nthe satisfactory performance of his responsibilities. He was called\r\nupon to submit, for himself and heirs, all his property as well as\r\nhis person to the control of the court of Paris as a pledge for the\r\nexecution of his trust. As late as 1618, in the reign of Charles IX.,\r\nthe master printers (_i. e._, printer-publishers) were obliged to hold\r\ncertificates from the Rector and the university, to the effect that\r\nthey were skilled in the art of printing, and that they possessed full\r\nknowledge of Latin and of Greek.\r\n\r\nThe _libraires jurés_ comprised two classes, the _libraires grands_\r\n(_officium magni librariatus_), and the _libraires petits_ (_officium\r\nparvi librariatus_).[286] The immediate responsibility for the\r\ngovernment of the body rested with the four chief _libraires_ (_les\r\nquatre grands libraires_). It was they who fixed the prices for the\r\nsale or hire of manuscripts, and who supervised the examination of\r\nmanuscripts with reference, first, as to their admission into the\r\nofficial list of the university texts, and, secondly, as to the\r\ncompleteness and accuracy of the particular parchment submitted. They\r\nalso inspected the book-shops and the workrooms of the copyists, and\r\nverified from time to time the accuracy and the quality of the copies\r\nprepared from these accepted texts; they passed upon the qualifications\r\nof applicants for the position of _libraire juré_; and, finally,\r\nthey exercised a general supervision over the enforcement of all the\r\nuniversity regulations affecting the book-trade, and gave special\r\nattention to those prohibiting any interference with this trade by an\r\noutside dealer, one who was not a _libraire juré_. These four chief\r\n_libraires_ were each under a bond or “caution” for the amount of 200\r\nlivres. In addition to the exemption from general taxes and guard duty\r\nconceded to all the _libraires jurés_, these four enjoyed from time\r\nto time certain special privileges. In October, 1418, by a regulation\r\nof Charles VI., the four chief _libraires_ are exempted by name from\r\ncertain special duties on wine, etc., which had been imposed for the\r\npurpose of securing funds _pour la recouvrance de nos Villes et Chastel\r\nde Monstreau ou Faut-Yonne_.[287] It was also necessary for him to find\r\ntwo responsible bondsmen for an amount of not less than 100 livres\r\neach.[288][289] In Bologna in 1400 the bond was also fixed at 200\r\nlivres, the equivalent of 5065 francs.[290]\r\n\r\nThe special obligations imposed upon and accepted by the _librarii_ and\r\n_stationarii_, as specified in documents between the years 1250 and\r\n1350, can be summarised as follows:\r\n\r\nI. To accept faithfully and loyally all the regulations of the\r\nuniversity concerning the production and the sale of books.\r\n\r\nII. Not to make within the term of one month any agreement, real or\r\nnominal, transferring to themselves the ownership of books which had\r\nbeen placed in their hands for sale.\r\n\r\nIII. Not to permit the loss or disappearance of any book so consigned\r\nfor the purpose later of acquiring ownership of the same.\r\n\r\nIV. To declare conscientiously and exactly the just and proper price of\r\neach book offered for sale, and to specify such price, together with\r\nthe name of the owner, in some conspicuous place in the work itself.\r\n\r\nV. To make no disposition of a consigned book without having in the\r\nfirst place informed the owner or his representative of the price to be\r\nsecured for the same, and to make immediate report and accounting of\r\nsuch price when received.\r\n\r\nVI. To charge as commission for the service of selling such book not\r\nmore than four deniers to a member of the university and not more than\r\nsix deniers to an outsider. This commission was to be paid by the\r\npurchaser, who seems to have been considered the obliged party in the\r\ntransaction.[291]\r\n\r\nVII. To place conspicuously in the windows of their shops a price list\r\nof all works kept on sale.\r\n\r\nThe _stationarii_ on their part were also held:\r\n\r\nI. To employ no scribes for the production of manuscripts other than\r\nthose who had been accepted and certified before the Rector.\r\n\r\nII. To offer for sale or for hire no manuscripts that had not been\r\npassed upon and “taxed” by the appointed authority.\r\n\r\nIII. To refuse to no applicant who was a member of the university the\r\nloan for hire of a manuscript, even though the applicant should require\r\nthe same for the purpose of producing copies.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a regulation of this character would, in the case of\r\nan original work by a contemporary author, have operated as a denial of\r\nany author’s rights. Such original work constituted, however, at this\r\ntime the very rare exception, and their authors were evidently obliged\r\nto content themselves with the prestige of securing circulation. The\r\ncase of a manuscript representing outlay and skilled labour on the\r\npart of the dealer, who might have had to make a toilsome journey\r\nto secure it, and who had later paid for the service of one or more\r\neditors for its collation and revision, was, of course, of much more\r\nfrequent occurrence. It is difficult to understand why this class of\r\neffort and enterprise should not have been encouraged by the university\r\nauthorities instead of being so largely nullified by regulations which\r\nmade of such a manuscript common property. This regulation is, however,\r\nidentical with that of Bologna. The penalty there for refusing to place\r\na manuscript at the service of a member of the university was five\r\nlivres.[292]\r\n\r\nIV. To offer for rent no texts that were not complete and correct.\r\n\r\nV. In the event of a work being brought to Paris by a stranger, to give\r\nimmediate information to the authorities in order that before such\r\nwork could be copied for hire or for sale it should be passed upon by\r\nthe authorities as orthodox and as suitable for the use of the members\r\nof the university, and as being complete and correct in its own text.\r\n\r\nAny _libraire_ who, having been duly sworn, should be convicted of\r\nviolation of these regulations, forfeited his office, and all the\r\nrights and privileges thereto appertaining; and all members of the\r\nuniversity, instructors or students, were strictly prohibited (under\r\npenalty of forfeiture of their own membership) from having further\r\ndealings with such a delinquent.[293]\r\n\r\nThese various regulations, while possibly required in connection with\r\nthe general interests of the university, were certainly exacting and\r\nmust have interfered not a little with any natural development of\r\nthe book-trade. It is nevertheless the case that the makers of books\r\nand the book-dealers in Paris occupied a more independent and a more\r\ndignified position than had been accorded to their brethren in Bologna.\r\nThe latter appear to have risen hardly above the grade of clerks or\r\nlower-class functionaries, while these earlier Parisian publishers\r\nsecured from the outset recognition as belonging to the higher\r\neducational work of the university, work in the shaping of which they\r\nthemselves took an important part.\r\n\r\nIn 1316 (the year of the accession of Philip V.) the association of\r\n_libraires jurés_ (authorised or certified book-dealers) comprised\r\nbut thirteen members.[294] A year earlier there had been twenty-two,\r\nand I can only assume that the war troubles had had their natural\r\ninfluence in depressing and breaking up the book business. In 1323,\r\nthe list comprises twenty-nine names, including the widow of De\r\nPeronne. In 1368, the number had again fallen to twenty-five. In 1488,\r\nthe university list gives the names of twenty-four _libraires_, in\r\naddition to whom were registered two illuminators, two binders, and two\r\n_écrivains_.[295] The _écrivains_ specified were undoubtedly master\r\nscribes, the register here quoted apparently not including the names of\r\nthe copyists employed. At this date, however, the work of the printers\r\nhad been going on in Paris for fourteen years, and the business of\r\nthose concerned with the production of books in manuscript form\r\nmust have been very largely reduced. The work of the master scribes\r\ncontinued, however, in the sixteenth century, but by the close of the\r\nfifteenth had become limited to the production, for collectors, of\r\nmanuscripts as works of art.\r\n\r\nWhile the majority of _libraires jurés_ were naturally Frenchmen,\r\nthere was no regulation to prevent the holding of such a post by a\r\nforeigner, and the list always, as a matter of fact, included several\r\nforeign names. The presence in the university of large groups of\r\nforeign students made it quite in order, and probably necessary, that\r\nthey should find among the book-dealers some who could speak their home\r\nlanguage and who could make clear to them the requirements concerning\r\nthe university texts. The presence of these foreign book-dealers\r\nalso facilitated the arrangements for the exchange of manuscripts\r\nbetween Paris and foreign universities. These foreign book-dealers,\r\nwhile obliged in ordinary routine to take an oath of fealty to the\r\nuniversity, were not called upon to become citizens of France.\r\n\r\nThe list includes from time to time the names of women _libraires_,\r\nthese women being usually widows of _libraires_ who had duly qualified\r\nthemselves. The women must themselves, however, in order to secure\r\nsuch appointments, have been able to pass the examination in Latin, in\r\npalæography, and in the technicalities of manuscript book-making. In\r\nrespect as well to the admission of foreigners as to that of women, the\r\nParis guild of the university book-dealers practised a more liberal\r\npolicy than that followed by the university authorities of Bologna\r\nor the Stationers’ Hall of London. Later, this liberal policy was\r\nrestricted, and in 1686 it was ordered that no foreigners should be\r\nadmitted to the lists of the master _libraires_ of the university.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of a manuscript during the fourteenth century was\r\nattended with almost as many formalities and precautions as are to-day\r\nconsidered necessary for the transfer of a piece of real estate. The\r\ndealer making the sale was obliged to give to the purchaser guarantees\r\nto the effect, first, that he was himself the owner or the duly\r\nauthorised representative of the owner of the work; and, secondly, that\r\nthe text of this was complete and correct, and as security for these\r\nguarantees he pledged his goods, and sometimes even his person. As a\r\nsingle example of a transaction illustrating this practice, I quote a\r\ncontract cited by Du Breuil. This bears date November, 1332, and sets\r\nforth that a certain Geoffrey de Saint Léger, a duly qualified _clerc\r\nlibraire_, acknowledges and confesses that he has sold, ceded, and\r\ntransferred to the noble gentleman Messire Gérard de Montagu, _Avocat\r\ndu Roi au Parlement_ (counsellor at the royal court), all right, title,\r\nand interest in a work entitled _Speculum Historiale in consuetudines\r\nParisienses_, contained in four volumes bound in red leather. The\r\nconsideration named is forty livres Parisian, the equivalent, according\r\nto the tables of de Wailly, of 1013 francs. The vendor pledges as\r\nsecurity for the obligation under the contract all his worldly goods,\r\ntogether with his own person (_tous et chacun de ses biens, et\r\nguarantie de son corps même_), and the contract is attested before two\r\nnotaries.[296]\r\n\r\nWhile the university assumed the strictest kind of control and\r\nsupervision over the work of the book-dealers, it conceded, as an\r\noffset, to the association of these dealers a very substantial\r\nmonopoly of the trade of making and selling books. It was prohibited,\r\nunder severe penalties, for a person not a _libraire juré_ to do\r\nbusiness in a book-shop or at any fixed stand; that is to say, he\r\ncould not sell as a _stationnaire_, but had to carry on his trade as a\r\npedlar or chap-man, from a pack or a cart. The value of the manuscript\r\nthat such pedlar was permitted to offer for sale was restricted to\r\nten _sous_, the equivalent of half a franc. At the price at which\r\nmanuscripts were held during the fourteenth century, this limitation\r\nrestricted the trade of the peripatetic vendors to single sheets, or\r\nbroadsides, containing usually a _Pater_, an _Ave_, or a _Credo_, or\r\na brief calendar or astrological table. Successive edicts were issued\r\nfrom reign to reign, renewing the prohibition upon the selling of\r\nbooks, whether in French or Latin (excepting only of such maximum\r\nvalue), by any drapers, grocers, pedlars, or dealers of any kind.[297]\r\n\r\nIn all the official references of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies to the book-dealers, the ground is taken that they formed a\r\nclass apart from mechanics or from traders in ordinary merchandise.\r\nThey were considered to be engaged in an intellectual pursuit, and were\r\ntreated as members of a profession upon whose service the work of the\r\nuniversity and that of the Church were largely dependent. Thus in 1649\r\nthe _Recueil_ makes use of these words:\r\n\r\n_Les Marchands-Libraires, Imprimeurs et Relieurs seront toujours\r\ncensés du corps de nostre bien aymée fille aisnée l’Université; du\r\ntout séparés des arts méchaniques, et autres Corps de Mestiers ou\r\nmarchandises; et come tels, conservés en la jouissance de tous les\r\ndroicts; priviléges, franchises, libertez, préséances et prérogatives\r\nattribuées à ladite université et à eux par les Royes nos prédécesseux\r\net par nous._[298]\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, not permitted to the _libraire_ to bring discredit\r\nupon his profession by also engaging in any “sordid pursuits” (_viles\r\noccupations_), and in so doing he rendered himself liable to being\r\ndeposed from his high post (_declaré déchu de son noble office_). He\r\ncould, however, unite with his work as _libraire_ that of a notary, or\r\nthat of a royal counsellor or practitioner in the higher court (_avocat\r\ndu roi au Parlement_).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the personal prestige and the substantial advantages\r\nwhich were thus enjoyed by the book-dealers of the university, there\r\nwere from time to time instances of protest, amounting occasionally to\r\ninsubordination, on the part of the _libraires_, who, as their business\r\naims and possibilities developed, became restive under the long series\r\nof trammels and restrictions, and particularly in connection with those\r\nimposed by the ecclesiastical division of the university authorities.\r\nThe dread, however, of losing any portion of their privileges, and\r\nparticularly the risk of any impairment of their monopoly of the\r\nbook-trade of the university and of Paris, operated always as a\r\nsufficient consideration to prevent the insubordination from going to\r\nextremes. Throughout the entire period of the Middle Ages the control\r\nof the university continued, therefore, practically absolute over the\r\nbook-trade of Paris, the influence of the Church and the (more or less\r\nspasmodic) authority of the Crown being exercised by means of the\r\nuniversity machinery.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs continued for some period of years after the\r\nintroduction of printing. The university still insisted upon its\r\nresponsibility for the correctness and the completeness of the texts\r\nissued from the Paris press, although it gave up of necessity the\r\nroutine of examining individual copies of the printed editions. On\r\nthe other hand, the censorship control on the part of the theological\r\nFaculty over the moral character and orthodoxy of the works printed\r\nwas insisted upon more strenuously than ever as the Church began\r\nto recognise the enormous importance of the influence upon public\r\nopinion of the widely distributed printed volumes. The effect of this\r\necclesiastical control upon the business of printing books is set\r\nforth with some detail in the chapter on the early printers of Paris.\r\nIt is sufficient to say here that the contention on the part of the\r\nuniversity to control, as a portion of the work of higher education,\r\nthe business of the makers and sellers of books, while sharply attacked\r\nand materially undermined after the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\nwas not formally abandoned until the beginning of the eighteenth. At\r\nthis time the Crown took over to itself all authority to regulate the\r\npress, an authority which disappeared only with the revolution of 1789.\r\n\r\nFor six centuries the book-trade of Paris and of France, whether it\r\nconsisted in the production of manuscripts for the exclusive use of\r\nmembers of the university, or of printed books for the enlightenment of\r\nthe general public, had been obliged to do its work under the hampering\r\nand burdensome regulations and restrictions of a varying series of\r\nauthorities. The rectors of the university, the theologians of the\r\nSorbonne, the lawyers of the Parliament of Paris, the chancellors of\r\nthe Crown, the kings themselves, had all taken a hand, sometimes in\r\nturn, not infrequently in conflict with each other, in the task of\r\n“regulating” the trade in books. The burden of the restrictions was,\r\nin pretence at least, offset by various privileges and exemptions,\r\nbut they remained burdens notwithstanding. It may well be a cause\r\nof surprise that in the face of such a long series of hampering\r\ndifficulties, difficulties more serious than those with which any\r\npublishers in the world, outside of Rome, had to contend, the\r\nmanuscript publishers and the later printer-publishers of Paris should\r\nhave been able to do so much to make Paris a literary and a publishing\r\ncentre. As has been already indicated, it was certainly the case\r\nthat during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Paris shared with\r\nFlorence the position of being the centre of the manuscript trade of\r\nEurope. It was also the case, as will be set forth in a later chapter,\r\nthat the first printer-publishers of Paris did most noteworthy work in\r\nfurthering the development of scholarly publishing and the production\r\nof scholarly books. It required, however, the revolution of 1789 to\r\nestablish the principle that the business of producing and distributing\r\nbooks could secure its legitimate development only when freed from\r\ncensorship restrictions and regulations, and that it was a business the\r\ncontrol of which belonged properly not to the university, the Courts of\r\nParliament, or the Crown, but to the people themselves.\r\n\r\nConsidering the scarcity and the costliness of books in the Middle\r\nAges, it is somewhat surprising that the work of instruction rested\r\nso directly upon books, that is, depended upon the mastery of a text.\r\nThurot says: “It is the distinctive character of instruction in the\r\nMiddle Ages that the science was not taught directly and in itself, but\r\nby the explanation of books which derived their authority solely from\r\ntheir writers.”[299] Roger Bacon formulates it: “When one knows the\r\ntext, one knows all that concerns the science which is the object of\r\nthe text.”[300] Instead of taking a course of logic or of ethics, says\r\nCompayré, the phrase was reading a book on logic or ethics, _legere_ or\r\n_audire librum_. This close adherence to the text secured, of course,\r\nan assured demand in the university towns first for the hired _pecias_\r\nand later for the purchased manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the College of the Sorbonne dates from 1257. It was\r\norganised by Robert de Sorbon, chaplain to Louis IX. The college was\r\nat once affiliated with the University of Paris, of which it became\r\nthe theological Faculty, and in the general direction of which it\r\nexercised at times a controlling influence. The college is connected\r\nwith my subject on the ground of its assumption of the theological\r\ncensorship of the Paris book-trade and of its frequent attempts to\r\nexercise a general censorship over all the productions of the Paris\r\nprinting-press.\r\n\r\nAs we shall note later in the history of the Paris book-trade, various\r\ncomplications arose between the publishers and booksellers possessing\r\na university license (the _libraires jurés_) and certain unlicensed\r\ndealers who undertook to come into competition with them. The locality\r\noccupied by these unlicensed booksellers was on the Island of the Cité,\r\nimmediately by the precincts of Notre Dame. In fact it was the case\r\nwith the book-trade generally north of the Alps that its business was\r\nvery largely carried on in the portals of a church if not under the\r\nimmediate shadow of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nWhile in Italy the Church furthered but slightly the early production\r\nof books and, later, did not a little to hamper the undertakings of the\r\npublishers, it was the case in France and quite largely also in South\r\nGermany, that the publishers found themselves very largely dependent\r\nupon the scholarly interests and the scholarly co-operation of the\r\nclerics, and the association of the Church with the book-trade was, for\r\na large proportion at least of the fifteenth century, an important one.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, the booksellers licensed by the university were all in the\r\nLatin Quarter, and in the same region were to be found the sellers\r\nof parchment, the illuminators, the scribes, binders, etc., who also\r\ncarried university licenses and were under university supervision. It\r\nis probable that the specification in the Tax Roll of 1292 of eight\r\n_librarii_ in Paris refers only to the booksellers licensed by the\r\nuniversity and carrying on their business in the Latin Quarter.\r\n\r\nIn Bayeux, in 1250, certain clerics were exempted from taxation if\r\nthey dealt in parchment or if they were engaged in the copying of\r\nmanuscripts, and the book-shops along the walls of the cathedral were\r\nalso exempt from taxation. It is not clear to me in looking up this\r\nrecord, whether the tax mentioned was a town tax or a general tax, or\r\nwhether it was one of the ecclesiastical levies.[301]\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon’s reference to the scribes of Paris has already been\r\nmentioned. He could not secure from the Brothers of his Order a\r\ntranscript of his work which he desired to present to Pope Clement,\r\nbecause they were too ignorant to write the same out intelligently,\r\nwhile he was afraid to confide the work to the public scribes of\r\nFrance lest they might make improper use of the material.[302] It is\r\nWattenbach’s opinion that the wrongful use of his production dreaded by\r\nBacon was the sale of unauthorised copies of it by the scribes to whom\r\nthe preparation of the authorised copies should be confided.\r\n\r\nIn 1292, Wenzel, King of Bohemia, presented to the monastery of\r\nKönigsaal, 200 marks in silver for the purchase of books, and the\r\npurchases were made from the book-sellers in Paris. Richard de Bury\r\nextols Paris as the great centre of the book-trade. Of the value of\r\nthe book collections in Rome and the possibility there of securing\r\nliterary treasures, he had already spoken, but the treasures of Paris\r\nappear to have impressed him still more keenly. There he found occasion\r\nto open his purse freely and took in exchange for base gold, books of\r\ninestimable value. Joh. Gerson, in his treatise _De Laude Scriptorum_\r\nexpresses the dread lest the persistent carrying away from Florence\r\nof his books by wealthy visitors may not too seriously diminish its\r\nliterary treasures.\r\n\r\nThe Paris publishers appear to have sent out travelling salesmen or\r\nrepresentatives to take orders for their wares. As early as 1480, a\r\npublisher named Guillaume Tousé, of Paris, made complaint to the\r\nchancellor of Brittany to the effect that he had entrusted a commission\r\nto a certain Guillaume de l’Espine to carry books into Lower Brittany\r\nand to make sale of the same during a period of six months. He had\r\ntaken with him books to the value of five hundred livres and was to\r\nhave a salary of ten crowns for the six months’ work. He had, however,\r\nfailed to return or to make report of his commission. Tousé secured a\r\njudgment against his delinquent traveller, but the record does not show\r\nwhether he ever succeeded in getting hold of him again.[303]\r\n\r\nIn the universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, the _stationarii_\r\nbegan their work some years later than in Paris or Bologna. They had\r\nthe advantage, however, of freedom from the greater portion of the\r\nrestrictions and special supervision which hampered the work of the\r\nscribes in the Italian and French universities, and as a result their\r\nbusiness developed more promptly and more actively, and in the course\r\nof a few years, they became the booksellers of the university towns.\r\nIt was, of course, from this university term _stationarii_ that the\r\nname of stationers came at the outset to be applied to the organised\r\nbook-dealers of Great Britain. The Guild of the British book-dealers\r\ncompleted its organisation in 1403, nearly sixty years before the\r\nintroduction into England of the printing-press.[304]\r\n\r\nThe art work put into the manuscripts produced in the Low Countries,\r\nparticularly in Belgium, was more highly developed and was a more\r\nimportant part of the industry than was the case in any other portion\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier German universities, the _stationarii_ also found place\r\nand found work, but this work seems to have been of less importance\r\nand the scribes appear to have secured for themselves a less definite\r\nuniversity recognition than in Italy or in France. The explanation\r\ngiven by Wattenbach is that the German students, being better informed\r\nand more industrious, did for themselves a larger portion of the\r\ntranscribing required and were, therefore, freed from the necessity of\r\nhiring their hefts.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of the universities of Prague and of Vienna permitted the\r\nmasters and the baccalaureates to secure from the university archives,\r\nunder certain pledges, the loan of the books authorised as text-books\r\nor of works of reference, for the purpose of making trustworthy copies\r\nof the same. The copyists were enjoined as follows:\r\n\r\n_Fideliter et correcte, tractim et distincte, assignando paragraphos,\r\ncapitales literas, virgulas et puncta, prout sententia requirit._[305]\r\nThe practice also obtained in these universities of having texts\r\ndictated to the students by the _magisters_ or the Bachelors of Arts.\r\nThis was described as _librum pronuntiare_, and also as _ad pennam\r\ndare_.\r\n\r\nIn this phrase, Karoch sent word to Erfurt that _ad pennam dabit_ his\r\ntreatise _Arenga_.[306]\r\n\r\nThe text-books utilised in the German universities in the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries were as limited in range and in number\r\nas those of Bologna and of Padua. The instruction in the medical\r\ndepartments of Prague and Vienna was based in the main on the works of\r\nHippocrates and Galen, with some of the later commentaries, principally\r\nfrom Arabian writers. In philosophy the chief authority was Aristotle,\r\nin mathematics Euclid, and in astronomy Ptolemy. A few works of later\r\ndate were utilised, such as the _Summula_ of Petrus Hispanus and the\r\n_De Sphæra Mundi_ of Johannes de Sacro Bosco. Bosco is otherwise known\r\nas John Holywood or Halifax. He held the chair of mathematics in the\r\nUniversity of Paris about the middle of the thirteenth century. The\r\nuse of his treatise for classes in Prague is evidence of a certain\r\ninterchange between the universities of books in manuscript.\r\n\r\nAn important reason for the very large membership of the universities\r\nof the Middle Ages as compared with their successors of to-day, is\r\nto be found in the fact that they undertook to supply not only the\r\nhigher education which belongs to the present university curriculum,\r\nbut also the training now furnished by the _gymnasia_ or High Schools,\r\nwhich were at that time not in existence. We find, therefore, in their\r\nmembership, thousands of students who were little more than boys either\r\nin their years or in their mental development.\r\n\r\nThe universities also, on the other hand, attracted to their\r\nmembership very many students of mature age, who came sometimes for\r\nspecial purposes, but more frequently because it was only in the\r\nuniversity towns that circles of scholars could be found, that books\r\nwere available, and that any large measure of intellectual activity\r\nwas to be experienced. As Savigny puts it: “The universities were,\r\nduring the Middle Ages, practically the only places where men could\r\nstudy or could exercise their minds with any degree of freedom.” It\r\nwas inevitable therefore, that, with the generations succeeding the\r\ndiscovery of printing, there should be a decrease in the influence\r\nand in the relative importance for the community of the universities.\r\nWith the establishment of secondary schools, the training of the boys\r\nwas cared for to better purpose elsewhere; and with the increasing\r\ncirculation of printed books, it became possible for men to come into\r\nrelations with literature in other places than in the lecture room.\r\nThe universities were no longer the sole depositories of learning\r\nor the sole sources of intellectual activity. This lessening of the\r\ninfluence of the universities represented, or was at least coincident\r\nwith, a wider development of intellectual activity and of interest in\r\nliterature on the part of the masses of the people. The universities\r\nalone would never have been in a position so to direct the thought\r\nof the community as to render the masses of citizens competent to\r\narrive at conclusions for themselves and sufficiently assured in such\r\nconclusions to be prepared to make them the basis of action. This was,\r\nof course, partly because, notwithstanding the large membership and the\r\nfact that this membership represented nearly all the classes in the\r\ncommunity, the universities could at best come into direct relations\r\nbut with a small proportion of the people. A more important cause\r\nfor such lack of intellectual leadership is to be found in the fact\r\nthat the standard of thought and of instruction in the universities\r\nconcerned itself very little with the intellectual life or issues of\r\nthe immediate time. As Biot puts it (speaking, to be sure, of a later\r\ncentury): “The universities were several centuries in arrears with all\r\nthat concerned the sciences and the arts. Peripatetics, when all the\r\nworld had renounced with Descartes the philosophy of Aristotle, they\r\nbecame Cartesians when the rest were Newtonians. That is the way with\r\nlearned bodies which do not make discoveries.”\r\n\r\nIt was the dissemination of literature through the new art of printing\r\nrather than the diffusion of education through the university lecture\r\nrooms, which brought to the masses of the people the consciousness\r\nof mental existence and of individual responsibility for arriving at\r\nsound conclusions. Prior to the printing-press, this responsibility\r\nhad been left by the people with their “spiritual advisers,” who were\r\ncharged with the duty of doing the thinking for their flocks. It was\r\nthis change in the mental status of the people which was the precursor\r\n(although at a considerable space of years) of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning in Germany of the movement known as Humanism, the\r\nrepresentatives of the new thought of the time were not to be found in\r\nthe university circles, and had not received their inspiration from\r\nthe lecture rooms. Says Paulsen: “The entire traditional conduct of\r\nthe universities, and in particular of the instruction in arts and\r\ntheology, was rejected with the utmost scorn by the new culture through\r\nits representatives, the poets and orators, to whom form and substance\r\nalike of this teaching seemed the most outrageous barbarism, which they\r\nnever wearied of denouncing.” In the _Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum_,\r\nwhich were issued about 1516 from the band of youthful poets gathered\r\nabout Mutianus at Erfurt, the hatred and detestation felt by the\r\nHumanists for the ancient university system raised to itself a lasting\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years from the publication of the _Epistolæ_, the\r\ninfluence of the Humanists had so far extended itself as to have\r\neffected a large modification in the systems of study in all the larger\r\nuniversities. “The old ecclesiastical Latin was replaced by classical\r\nLatin; Roman authors, particularly the poets, were made the subject of\r\nlectures, and the old translations of Aristotelian texts were driven\r\nout by new translations on principles advocated by the Humanists. Greek\r\nwas taken up in the Faculty of arts and courses in the language and\r\nliterature were established in all universities.”[307]\r\n\r\nAn immediate result of these changes and extensions was an active\r\ndemand for printed texts. The Humanistic movement, itself in a\r\nmeasure the result of the printing-press, was a most important fact\r\nin providing business for the German printers during the earlier\r\nyears of the sixteenth century. The strifes and contentions of the\r\nReformation checked the development in the universities of the\r\nstudies connected with the intellectual movement of the Renaissance\r\nand lessened the demand for the literature of these studies. The\r\nactive-minded were absorbed in theological controversies, and those\r\nwho could not understand the questions at issue could still shout\r\nthe shibboleths of the leaders. As Erasmus put it, rather bitterly,\r\n_ubi regnat Lutheranismus, ibi interitus litterarum_. The literature\r\nof the Reformation, however, itself did much to make good for the\r\nprinting-presses the lessened demand for the classics, while a\r\nfew years later, the organisation of the Protestant schools and\r\nuniversities aroused intellectual activities in new regions, and\r\ncreated fresh requirements for printed books. Within half a century,\r\nin fact, of the Diet of Worms, the centre of the book-absorbing\r\npopulation of Germany had been transferred from the Catholic states of\r\nthe south to the Protestant territories of the north, and the literary\r\npreponderance of the latter has continued to increase during the\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK-TRADE IN THE MANUSCRIPT PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--It seems probable that the book-trade which had been\r\nintroduced into Gaul from Rome still existed during the sixth century.\r\nF. J. Mone finds references to such trade in the chronicles of Cæsarius\r\nof Arles.[308] In the code of laws of the Visigoths, it is provided\r\nthat copies of the volume containing the laws shall be sold at not more\r\nthan six sols.[309]\r\n\r\nWattenbach is of opinion that not only in Rome but in other Italian\r\ncentres some fragments of the classic book-trade survived the fall of\r\nthe Empire and the later invasions and changes of rulers, and he finds\r\nreferences to book-dealers in Italy as late as the sixth century.[310]\r\nHe takes the ground that, notwithstanding the destruction of buildings,\r\nlibrary collections, and in fact of whole cities, during the various\r\ncontests, first with the Barbarian invaders and later between these\r\ninvaders themselves, there still remained scholarly people who\r\nretained their interest in Latin literature; and he points out that,\r\nnotwithstanding the many changes in the rulers of Italy between the\r\nyear 476 and the beginning of the eleventh century, Latin never ceased\r\nto remain the official language and, as he maintains, the language of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nIn the _Tetralogus_ of Wipo are the following lines which have a\r\nbearing upon this belief in the continuation of some literary interests\r\nin Italy:\r\n\r\n  _Hoc servant Itali post prima crepundia cuncti,\r\n  Et sudare scholis mandatur tota juventus.\r\n  Solis Teutonicis vacuum vel turpe videtur,\r\n  Ut doceant aliquem, nisi clericus accipiatur._[311]\r\n\r\n(From their cradle up all Italians pay heed to learning, and their\r\nchildren are kept at work in the schools. It is only among the Germans\r\nthat it is held to be futile and wrong to give instruction to one who\r\nis not to become a cleric.)\r\n\r\nGiesebrecht, in his treatise _De Litterarum Studiis apud Italos_,\r\nconfirms this view. He refers to a manuscript of Orosius which was\r\nwritten in the seventh century and which contains an inscription\r\nstating that this copy of the manuscript was prepared by the scribe in\r\nthe _Statione Magistri Viliaric Antiquarii_.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the earlier examples of the use of the term _statio_,\r\nfrom which is derived the term _stationarii_, indicating scribes whose\r\nwork was done in a specific workshop or headquarters, as contrasted\r\nwith writers who were called upon to do work at the homes of their\r\nclients. As is specified in the chapter on the universities, this term\r\ncame to be used to designate booksellers (that is to say, producers\r\nof books) who had fixed work-shops. In the Acts of the Council of\r\nConstantinople, the scribe who wrote out the record of the fifth\r\nSynod is described as _Theodorus librarius qui habuit stationem ad S.\r\nJohannem Phocam_.[312]\r\n\r\nIn such work-shops, while the chief undertaking was the production of\r\nbooks, the scribes were ready to prepare announcements and to write\r\nletters, as is even to-day the practice of similar scribes in not a few\r\nItalian cities and villages.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the seventh century, Rome was for a considerable\r\nperiod practically the only book market in the world, that is to say,\r\nthe only place in which books could be obtained on order and in which\r\nthe machinery for their production continued to exist. In 658, S.\r\nGertrude ordered for the newly founded monastery at Nivelle certain\r\nsacred volumes to be prepared in the city of Rome.[313] Beda reports\r\nthat the Abbot Benedict of Wearmouth, in 671, secured from Rome a\r\nnumber of learned and sacred works, _non paucos vel placito pretio\r\nemtos vel amicorum dono largitos retulit_. (He brought back a number\r\nof books, some of which he had purchased at the prices demanded, while\r\nothers he had received as gifts from his friends.) Later, the Abbot\r\nrepeated his journeys, and in 678, and again in 685, brought back fresh\r\ncollections. The collections secured on his last journey included even\r\ncertain examples of the profane writers.[314]\r\n\r\nA similar instance is noted in the chronicles of the monastery of St.\r\nWandrille. The Abbot Wandregisil sent his nephew Godo to Rome in 657,\r\nand Godo brought back with him as a present from the Pope Vitalian,\r\nnot only valuable relics, but many volumes of the sacred Scriptures\r\ncontaining both the New and the Old Testament.[315] During the time\r\nof the Abbot Austrulf (747-753) a chest was thrown up by the sea on\r\nthe shore. It contained relics and also a _codicem pulcherrimum_, or\r\nbeautiful manuscript, containing the four gospels, _Romana Littera\r\nOptime Scriptum_.\r\n\r\nThis term _Romana Littera_ has been previously referred to as\r\nindicating a special script which had been adopted in Rome by the\r\nearlier instructors for sacred writings.\r\n\r\nAlcuin relates of the Archbishop Ælbert of York (766-780):\r\n\r\n  _Non semel externas peregrino tramite terras,\r\n  Jam peragravit ovans, Sophiæ deductus amore,\r\n  Si quid forte novi librorum seu studiorum,_\r\n  _Quod secum ferret, terris reperiret in illis.\r\n  Hic quoque Romuleam venit devotus ad urbem._[316]\r\n\r\n(More than once he has travelled joyfully through remote regions and\r\nby strange roads, led on by his zeal for knowledge, and seeking to\r\ndiscover in foreign lands novelties in books or in studies which he\r\ncould take back with him. And this zealous student journeyed to the\r\ncity of Romulus.)\r\n\r\nDuring the Italian expeditions of the German Emperors, books were from\r\ntime to time brought back to Germany. Certain volumes referred to by\r\nPez as having been in the Library at Passau, in 1395, contain the\r\ninscription _isti sunt libri quos Roma detulimus_.\r\n\r\nWattenbach finds record of an organised manuscript business in Verona\r\nas early as 1338,[317] and of a more important trade in manuscripts\r\nbeing carried on in Milan at the same time. In the fourteenth century,\r\nRichard de Bury speaks of buying books for his library from Rome. The\r\nreferences to this early manuscript business in Italy are, however, so\r\nfragmentary that it is difficult to determine how far the works secured\r\nwere the remnants of old libraries or collections, or how far they were\r\nthe productions of scribe work-shops engaged in manifolding copies for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nIt seems evident, however, that while a scattered trade in manuscripts\r\nwas carried on both by the scribes in the towns and between the\r\nmonastery _scriptoria_, the facilities for the production and\r\nmanifolding of manuscript copies were hardly adequate to meet the\r\ndemand or requirements of readers and students. As early as 250,\r\nOrigen, writing in Cappadocia, was complaining that he found difficulty\r\nin getting his teachings distributed. A zealous disciple, named\r\nAmbrosius, secured for the purpose a group of scribes whose transcripts\r\nwere afterwards submitted to Origen for revision before being sent\r\nout through the churches. It is further related that Origen became so\r\nabsorbed in the work of correcting these manuscripts that he could\r\nnot be called from his desk either for exercise or for meals.[318] S.\r\nJerome, a century later, when he was sojourning in Bethlehem, found\r\nsimilar difficulty. He had among his monks some zealous scribes, but he\r\ncomplained that their work was untrustworthy.[319]\r\n\r\nAbbot Lupus of Ferrières was obliged (in the ninth century) to apply to\r\nmonks in York in order to secure the transcribing work that he required.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this difficulty in securing books, it became\r\ncustomary, when copies were loaned from libraries, to secure from\r\nthe borrower a pledge or security of equal or greater value. The\r\ncorrespondence of the time gives frequent instances of the difficulty\r\nin getting back books that had been loaned, notwithstanding the risk\r\nof the forfeiture of the pledges. In 1020, Notker writes from St. Gall\r\nto the Bishop of Sitten that certain books belonging to the Bishop,\r\nfor which the Bishop was making demand, had been borrowed by the\r\nAbbot Aregia, and that, notwithstanding many applications, he had not\r\nsucceeded in getting even a promise of their return.[320] In Vercelli,\r\na beautiful mass book which had been loaned by the Abbot Erkenbald of\r\nFulda (997-1011) to the Bishop Henry of Wurzburg, was to have been\r\nretained for the term of the Bishop’s life. After the death of the\r\nBishop, reclamation was made from Fulda for the return of the volume,\r\nbut without success. During the years 1461-1463, the Legate Marinus de\r\nFregeno travelled through Sweden and Norway and collected there certain\r\nmanuscripts which he claimed were those that had been taken away from\r\nRome at the time of its plunder by the Goths. He evidently took the\r\nground that where books were concerned, a term of one thousand years\r\nwas not sufficient to constitute a “statute of limitations.”\r\n\r\nLouis IX. of France is quoted as having taken the ground that books\r\nshould be transcribed rather than borrowed, because in that way the\r\nnumber would be increased and the community would be benefited. In\r\nmany cases, however, there could, of course, be no choice. The King,\r\nfor instance, desired to possess the great encyclopedia of Vincenzo\r\nof Beauvais. He sent gold to Vincenzo, in consideration of which a\r\ntranscript of the encyclopedia was prepared. The exact cost is not\r\nstated.[321]\r\n\r\nIn 1375, a sum equivalent to 825 francs of to-day was paid for\r\ntranscribing the commentary of Heinrich Bohic on the Decretals of 1375.\r\nIn the cost of such work was usually included a price for the loan or\r\nuse of the manuscript. A fee or rental was, in fact, always charged\r\nby the manuscript-dealers. Up to the close of the fourteenth century,\r\nthe larger proportion of transcripts were prepared for individual\r\nbuyers and under special orders, one of the evidences of this being\r\nthe fact that upon the titles of the manuscripts were designed or\r\nilluminated the arms or crests of the purchasers. After the beginning\r\nof the fifteenth century, there is to be found a large number of\r\nmanuscripts in which a place has been left blank on the title-pages for\r\nthe subsequent insertion of the crest or coat-of-arms, indicating that\r\nin these instances the manuscript had been prepared for general use\r\ninstead of under special order.[322]\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, Charlemagne interested himself, not only in\r\nthe training of scribes, but in the collection of books, but he does\r\nnot appear to have considered it important that the works secured by\r\nhim should be retained for the use of his descendants, as he gave\r\ninstructions in his will that after his death the books should be sold.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest illuminated Irish manuscripts is that of S. Ceaddæ.\r\nThis was purchased, at what date is not specified, by some holy man\r\nin exchange for his best steed, and was then presented by him to the\r\nchurch at Llandaff. The manuscript finally made its way to Madrid\r\nand thence to Stockholm; according to the record, it had, before\r\nthe purchase above mentioned, been saved out of the hands of Norman\r\npirates.[323] It is certain that very many of the monasteries which\r\nwere within reach of the incursions of the Normans were bereft by them\r\nof such books as had been collected, although it is not probable that,\r\nas a rule, the pirates had any personal interest in, or commercial\r\nappreciation for, the manuscripts that fell into their hands.\r\n\r\nGerbert, whose literary interests have been previously referred to, and\r\nwho is described as the most zealous book collector of his time, tells\r\nus that he made purchases for his library in Italy, in South Germany,\r\nand in the Low Countries, but he does not mention whether he was\r\npurchasing from dealers or individuals. He was a native of Auvergne,\r\nand in 999 became Pope (under the name of Gregory V.). Abbot Albert of\r\nGembloux, who died in 1048, states that he brought together, at great\r\ncost, as many as one hundred and fifty manuscripts.[324]\r\n\r\nA certain Deopert records that he purchased for the monastery of St.\r\nEmmeran, from Vichelm, the chaplain of Count Regimpert, for a large sum\r\nof money (the price is not specified), the writings of Alcuin.[325]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the very strict regulations to the contrary, it not\r\nunfrequently happened that monasteries and churches, when in special\r\nstress for money, pledged or sold their books to Jews. As the greater\r\nproportion at least of the sacred writings of the monasteries would\r\nhave had no personal interest for their Hebrew purchasers, it is\r\nfair to assume that these were taken for re-sale, and that, in fact,\r\nthere came to be a certain trade in books on the part of financiers\r\nacting in the capacity of pawn-brokers. In 1320, the monastery of S.\r\nUlrich was in need of funds, and the Abbot Marquard, of Hagel, pawned\r\nto the mendicant monks a great collection of valuable books, among\r\nwhich were certain volumes that had been prepared as early as 1175\r\nunder the directions of the Abbot Heinrich. The successor of Marquard,\r\nConrad Winkler, in 1344, succeeded in getting back a portion of the\r\nbooks, by the payment of 27 pounds heller, and 15 pfennigs.[326]\r\nInstances like these give evidence that a certain trade in manuscript\r\nbooks, in Northern Europe at least, preceded by a number of years the\r\norganisation of any systematised book-trade.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff speaks of usurers, dealers in old clothes, and pedlars,\r\ncarrying on the trade in the buying and selling of books during the\r\nfirst half of the fifteenth century. In Milan, a dealer in perfumery,\r\nPaolino Suordo, included in his stock (in 1470) manuscripts for sale,\r\nand later announced himself as a dealer in printed books. Both in\r\nEngland and France at this time manuscripts were dealt in by grocers\r\nand by the mercers. The monastery of Neuzelle, in 1409, pawned several\r\nhundred manuscripts for 130 gulden, and the monastery at Dobrilugk, in\r\n1420, sold to the Prebendary of Brandenburg 1441 volumes.\r\n\r\nIn 1455, the Faculty of Arts of the University of Heidelberg bought\r\nvaluable books from the estate of the Prior of Worms. In 1402, the\r\ncathedral at Breslau rented a number of books from Burgermeister Johann\r\nKyner, for which the Chapter was to pay during the lifetime of said\r\nKyner a yearly rental of eight marks, ten groschens.[327]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Speier rented to the precentor of the cathedral in 1447\r\nsome separately written divisions of the Bible, which were to be held\r\nby the precentor during his lifetime only, and were then to be returned\r\nto the Bishop’s heirs. The rental is not mentioned. The Chapter of the\r\nCathedral of Basel arranged to take over certain books from the owner\r\nor donor, whose name is not given, and to pay as consideration for the\r\nuse of the same, each year on the anniversary of the gift, 16 sols.[328]\r\n\r\nRichard de Bury makes a reference to the book-trade of Europe, as it\r\nexisted in the fourteenth century, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Stationariorum ac librariorum notitiam non solum intra natalis soli\r\nprovinciam, sed per regnum Franciæ, Teutoniæ et Italiæ comparavimus\r\ndispersorum faciliter pecunia prævolante, nec eos ullatenus impedivit\r\ndistantia neque furor maris absterruit, nec eis æs pro expensa defecit,\r\nquin ad nos optatos libros transmitterent vel afferrent._[329]\r\n\r\n(By means of advance payments, we have easily come into relations with\r\nthe _stationarii_ and _librarii_ who are scattered through our native\r\nprovince, and also with those who are to be found in the kingdoms\r\nof France, Germany, and Italy; and neither the great distances, nor\r\nthe fury of the sea, nor lack of money for their expenses has been\r\npermitted to prevent them from bringing or sending to us the books that\r\nwe desired.)\r\n\r\nIn the same work, De Bury uses the term _bibliator_, which he\r\nafterwards explained as being identical with _bibliopole_,--a seller of\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThe record of the production of books that was carried on in the\r\nearlier universities, such as Bologna and Padua, is presented in the\r\nchapter on the universities.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the very special requirements of the earlier Italian\r\nuniversities, and with the close control exercised by them over the\r\nscribes, it is evident that a book-trade in the larger sense of\r\nthe term could not easily come into existence. The first records of\r\nproducers and dealers of books of a general character were to be found,\r\nnot in the university towns, but in Milan, Florence, and particularly\r\nin Venice. In 1444, a copy of Macrobius was stolen from the scholar\r\nFilelfi, or Philelphus, which copy he recovered, as he tells us, in the\r\nshop of a public scribe in Vincenza.\r\n\r\nBlume mentions that in Venice the _Camaldulensers_ of S. Michael in\r\nMurano carried on during the earlier part of the fifteenth century an\r\nimportant trade in manuscripts, including with the older texts verified\r\ncopies which had been prepared under their own direction.[330] The\r\nheadquarters, not only for Italy but for Europe, of the trade of Greek\r\nmanuscripts, was for a number of years in Venice, the close relations\r\nof Venice with Constantinople and with the East having given it an\r\nearly interest in this particular class of Eastern productions.\r\n\r\nJoh. Arretinus was busied in Florence between the years 1375 and 1417\r\nin the sale of manuscripts, but he appears to have secured these mainly\r\nnot by production in Florence, but by sending scribes to the libraries\r\nin the monasteries and elsewhere to produce the copies required.\r\n\r\nA reference in a letter of Leonardo Bruni, written in 1416, gives\r\nindication of an organised book-trade in Florence at that time:\r\n\r\n_Priscianum quem postulas omnes tabernas librarias perscrutatus\r\nreperire nondum potui._[331] (I have hunted through all the book-shops,\r\nbut have not been able to find the Priscian for which you asked.)\r\n\r\nBruni writes again concerning a certain Italian translation of the\r\nBible that he had been trying to get hold of:\r\n\r\n_Jam Bibliothecas omnes et bibliopolas requisivi ut si qua veniant ad\r\nmanus eligam quæque optima mihi significent._ (I have already searched\r\nall the libraries and book-shops in order to select from the material\r\nat hand the manuscripts which are for me the most important.)\r\n\r\nAmbrogio Traversari wrote in 1418 in Florence:\r\n\r\n_Oro ut convenias bibliopolas civitatis et inquiri facias diligenter,\r\nan inveniamus decretales in parvo volumine._[332] (I beg you to make\r\nsearch among the booksellers of the city and ascertain whether it is\r\npossible to secure in a small volume a copy of the Decretals.)\r\n\r\nThe use for book-dealers of the old classic term _bibliopola_ in place\r\nof the more usual _stationarius_ is to be noted.\r\n\r\nFrom these references, we have a right to conclude that there were\r\nduring the first quarter of the fifteenth century in Florence a number\r\nof dealers in books who handled various classes of literature.\r\n\r\nThe great publisher of the fifteenth century, Philippi Vespasianus,\r\nor Vespasiano, who was not only a producer and dealer in manuscripts,\r\nbut a man possessed of a wide range of scholarship, called himself\r\n_librarius florentinus_. He held the post for a time of _bidellus_ of\r\nthe University of Florence. His work will be referred to more fully in\r\na later division of this chapter.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff points out that the dealers of this time, among others\r\nVespasiano himself, were sometimes termed _chartularii_, a term\r\nindicating that dealers in books were interested also in the sale\r\nof paper and probably of other writing materials. The Italian word\r\n_cartolajo_ specifies a paper-dealer or perhaps more nearly a stationer\r\nin the modern signification of the term.\r\n\r\nThe influx of Greek scholars into Italy began some years before the\r\nfall of Constantinople. Some of these scholars came from towns in Asia\r\nMinor, which had fallen under the rule of the Turks before the capture\r\nof Constantinople. When the Turkish armies crossed the Bosphorus, a\r\nnumber of the Greeks seem to have lost hope at a comparatively early\r\ndate of being able to defend the Byzantine territory, and had betaken\r\nthemselves with such property as they could save to various places of\r\nrefuge in the south of Europe, and particularly in Italy. As described\r\nin other chapters, many of these exiles brought with them Greek\r\nmanuscripts, and in some cases these codices were not only important\r\nas being the first copies of the texts brought to the knowledge of\r\nEuropean scholars, but were of distinctive interest and value as being\r\nthe oldest examples of such texts in existence.\r\n\r\nThe larger number of the exiles who selected Italy as their place of\r\nrefuge found homes and in many cases scholarly occupation, not in the\r\nuniversity towns so much as in the great commercial centres, such as\r\nVenice and Florence. Many of these Greeks were accepted as instructors\r\nin the families of nobles or of wealthy merchants, while others made\r\nuse of their manuscripts either through direct sale, through making\r\ntranscripts for sale, or through the loan of the originals to the\r\nmanuscript-dealers.\r\n\r\nA little later these manuscripts served as material and as “copy” for\r\nthe editions of the Greek classics issued by Aldus and his associates,\r\nthe first thoroughly edited and carefully printed Greek books that\r\nthe world had known. It was partly as a cause and partly as an effect\r\nof the presence of so many scholarly Greeks, that the study of Greek\r\nlanguage, literature, and philosophy became fashionable among the\r\nso-called higher circles of Italian society during the last half of the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe interest in Greek literature had, however, as pointed out, begun\r\nnearly twenty-five years earlier. As there came to be some knowledge\r\nof the extent of the literary treasures of classic Greece which\r\nhad been preserved in the Byzantine cities, not a few of the more\r\nenterprising dealers in manuscripts, and many also of the wealthier and\r\nmore enterprising of the scholarly noblemen and merchants, themselves\r\nsent emissaries to search the monasteries and cities of the East for\r\nfurther manuscripts which could be purchased.\r\n\r\nOne reason, apparently, for the preference given by the Greeks to\r\nVenice and Florence over Bologna and Padua was the fact that the two\r\ngreat universities were devoted, as we have seen, more particularly\r\nto the subjects of law, theology, and medicine, subjects in which the\r\nlearning of the Greeks could be of little direct service.[333] The\r\nphilosophy and the poetry which formed the texts of the lectures given\r\nby the Greek scholars attracted many zealous and earnest students,\r\nbut these students came, as stated, largely outside of the university\r\ncircles. The doctors of law and the doctors of theology were among the\r\nlast of the Italian scholars to be interested in Homeric poetry or in\r\nthe theories of the Greek metaphysicians.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the fifteenth century and a few years before the\r\nintroduction of printing, a new term came to be used for dealers in\r\nmanuscripts. The scribes had in many cases naturally associated their\r\nbusiness interests with those of the makers of paper,--_cartolaji_, and\r\nthe latter name came to be applied not only to the paper manufacturers,\r\nbut to the purchasers of the paper upon which books were inscribed. In\r\nsome cases the paper-makers, or _cartolaji_, appear themselves to have\r\norganised staffs of scribes through whose labour their own raw material\r\ncould be utilised, while the name of paper-maker,--_cartolajo_, came to\r\nbe used to describe the entire concern.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction into Italy of printing, the association of the\r\npaper-makers with books became still more important, and not a few of\r\nthe original printer-publishers were formerly paper manufacturers,\r\nand continued this branch of trade while adding to it the work of\r\nmanufacturing books. Among such paper-making publishers is to be noted\r\nFrancesco Cartolajo, who was in business in Florence in 1507, and whose\r\nsurname was, of course, derived from the trade in which his family had\r\nfor some generations been engaged. Bonaccorsi turned his paper-making\r\nestablishment in Florence into a printing-office and book manufactory\r\nas early as 1472, and Montali, in Parma, took the same course in 1482;\r\nDi Sasso who, in 1481, came into association with the Brothers Brushi,\r\nunited his printing-office with their paper factory.\r\n\r\nFillippo Giunta, one of the earlier publishers in Florence, calls\r\nhimself _librarius et cartolajus_. It is possible that he reversed the\r\nbusiness routine above referred to, and united a paper factory with his\r\nprinting-office.\r\n\r\nOne result of the influx of Greek scholars, many of whom were\r\nthemselves skilled scribes while others brought with them scribes,\r\nwas the multiplying of the number of writers available for work and a\r\ncorresponding reduction in the cost of such work.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this change in the business conditions was to lessen\r\nthe practice of hiring manuscripts for a term of days or weeks, or of\r\ndividing manuscripts into _pecias_, and to increase the actual sale of\r\nworks in manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe university regulations, however, controlling the loaning of\r\nmanuscripts and of the _pecias_ appear to have been continued and\r\nrenewed through the latter half of the fifteenth century, that is to\r\nsay, not only after the trade in manuscripts, at popular prices, had\r\nlargely developed in cities like Florence, Venice, and Milan, but\r\neven after the introduction of printing. It would almost seem as if\r\nin regard to books in manuscript, the system which had been put into\r\nshape by the university authorities had had the effect of delaying for\r\na quarter of a century or so the introduction into Bologna and Padua\r\nof the methods of book production and book distribution which were\r\nalready in vogue in other cities of Italy. I do not overlook the fact\r\nthat there was in Florence also a university, but it is evident that\r\nthe book-trade in that city had never been under the control of the\r\nuniversity authorities, and that the methods of the dealers took shape\r\nrather from the general, common-sense commercial routine of the great\r\ncentre of Italian trade than from the narrow scholastic theories of the\r\nprofessors of law or of theology.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-five years before the art of printing, introduced\r\ninto Italy in 1464, had become generally diffused, the years in which\r\nthe trade in manuscripts was at its highest development, Florence\r\nsucceeded Venice as the centre of this trade, both for Italy and for\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the intellectual life of the city, and the fact that\r\nits citizens were cultivated and that its scholars were so largely\r\nthemselves men of wealth, the convenient location of the city for trade\r\ncommunications with the other cities of Italy and with the great marts\r\nin the East, in the West, and in the North, and the accumulation in\r\nsuch libraries as those of the Medici of collections, nowhere else\r\nto be rivalled, of manuscripts, both ancient and modern, united in\r\nsecuring for Florence the pre-eminence for literary production and for\r\nliterary interests.\r\n\r\nScholars, not only from the other Italian cities, but from France,\r\nGermany, and Hungary, came to Florence to consult manuscripts which in\r\nmany cases could be found only in Florence, or to purchase transcripts\r\nof these manuscripts, which could be produced with greater correctness,\r\ngreater beauty, and smaller expense by the _librarii_ of Florence than\r\nby producers of books in any other city. After the Greek refugees began\r\ntheir lecture courses, there was an additional attraction for scholars\r\nfrom the outer world to visit the Tuscan capital.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy scholars and merchant princes of Florence, whose\r\ncollections of manuscripts were given to the city during their\r\nlifetime, or who left such collections after their death to the\r\nFlorentine libraries, made it, as a rule, a condition of such gifts and\r\nsuch bequests that the books should be placed freely at the disposal\r\nof visitors desiring to make transcripts of the same. Such a condition\r\nappears in the will of Bonaccorsi,[334] while a similar condition was\r\nquoted by Poggio[335] in his funeral oration upon Niccolo d’ Niccoli,\r\nas having been the intention of Niccolo for the books bequeathed by him\r\nto his Florentine fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nForeign collectors who did not find it convenient themselves to\r\nvisit Florence, such as the Duke of Burgundy, and Matthias Corvinus\r\nof Hungary, kept employed in the city for a number of years scribes\r\nengaged in the work of preparing copies of these Florentine literary\r\ntreasures for the libraries of Nancy and of Buda-Pesth.\r\n\r\nMatthias was, it seems, not content with ordering the transcripts of\r\nthe works desired by him, but employed a scholarly editor, resident in\r\nFlorence, to supervise the work and to collate the transcripts with the\r\noriginals, and who certified to the correctness of the copies forwarded\r\nto Buda.[336] At the death of Matthias, there appear to have been left\r\nin Florence a number of codices ordered by him which had not yet been\r\npaid for, and these were taken over by the Medici.[337]\r\n\r\nIn a parchment manuscript of the Philippian orations is inscribed a\r\nnote by a previous owner, a certain Dominicus Venetus, to the effect\r\nthat he had bought the same in Rome from a Florentine bookseller for\r\nfive ducats in gold in 1460.[338] Dominicus goes on to say that he had\r\nused this manuscript in connection with the lectures of the learned\r\nBrother Patrus Thomasius.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirteenth century, there was a considerable development\r\nin the art of preparing and of illuminating and illustrating\r\nmanuscripts. One author is quoted by Tiraboschi as saying that the\r\nwork on a manuscript now required the services not of a scribe, but\r\nof an artist. For the transcribing of a missal and illuminating the\r\nsame with original designs, a monk in Bologna is quoted as having\r\nreceived in 1260 two hundred florins gold, the equivalent of about one\r\nhundred dollars. For copying the text of the Bible, without designs,\r\nanother scribe received in the same year eighty lire, about sixteen\r\ndollars.[339]\r\n\r\nThe work of the manuscript-dealers in Florence was carried on not only\r\nfor the citizens and sojourners in the city itself, but for the benefit\r\nof other Italian cities in which there was no adequate machinery for\r\nthe manifolding of manuscripts. Bartholomæus Facius, writing from\r\nNaples in 1448, speaks of the serious inadequacy of the scribes in that\r\ncity. There were but few men engaged in the business, and these were\r\npoorly educated and badly equipped.[340] Facius was, therefore, asking\r\na correspondent in Florence to have certain work done for him which\r\ncould not be completed in Naples. Poggio writes from Rome about the\r\nsame date to Niccolo in Florence to somewhat similar effect. He speaks\r\nwith envy of the larger literary facilities possessed by his Florentine\r\nfriends.[341]\r\n\r\nNext to Florence, the most important centre for the manuscript trade\r\nof North Italy was Milan. As early as the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, there is record of no less than forty professional scribes\r\nbeing at work in the city. Such literary work as was required by Genoa\r\nand other Italian towns within reach of the Lombardy capital came to\r\nMilan. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, when the population\r\nof the city was about 200,000, there had been in the city but two\r\nregistered copyists. More important, however, than that of either\r\nFlorence or Milan, was the manuscript trade of Venice, the position of\r\nwhich city gave it exceptional advantages as well for the collection of\r\ncodices from the East as for securing the services of skilled scribes\r\nfrom Athens or from Constantinople. One of the more noteworthy of the\r\nVenetian importers of manuscripts was Johannes Galeotti, a Genoese by\r\nbirth, who made various journeys to Constantinople, and whose special\r\ntrade is referred to in an inscription on a manuscript dating from 1450\r\nand containing the speeches of Demosthenes.[342]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Aurispa, who appears to have been\r\nthe most important manuscript-dealer of his time, not only in Venice,\r\nbut possibly in the world. Aurispa sent various agents to Greece and to\r\nthe farther East to collect manuscripts and kept scribes busied in his\r\nwork-shop in Venice in preparing authentic copies of these texts. One\r\nof his travellers was Plantinerus, who was sent to the Peloponnesus in\r\n1415, and who succeeded in securing there some valuable codices.[343]\r\nPlantinerus found, in executing his commissions, that he had to come\r\ninto competition with a traveller sent out by Cosimo de’ Medici on a\r\nsimilar errand.\r\n\r\nVenice possessed an advantage over the other Italian cities, not only\r\nin the collection of texts, and in its facilities for manifolding\r\nthese, but in its position for securing wide sales for the same in\r\nthe cities outside of Italy, with which it was, in connection with\r\nits active commerce, in regular relations. The lines of the Oxford\r\nprinters, Theo. Rood and Thomas Hunt, printed in their edition of the\r\n_Letters of Phalaris_, give an indication of the relations of the\r\nEnglish university in the early part of the fifteenth century with the\r\nliterary marts of Southern Europe.\r\n\r\n  _Celatos, Veneti, nobis transmittere libros\r\n  Cedite, nos aliis vendimus, O Veneti_--[344]\r\n\r\n(If you Venetians will send over to us the books which have been hidden\r\n(_i. e._ difficult or rare books, or possibly books unearthed from far\r\noff Eastern regions) we will find sale for the same.)\r\n\r\nThere is evidence in fact of a very active book-trade between Venice\r\nand England for many years before the introduction into Italy of the\r\nprinting-press. The work of Aldus and of those who were associated\r\nwith him in carrying on printing and publishing undertakings in Venice\r\nnaturally very largely extended these relations with the English\r\nscholars, but the channels for the same had already been opened. The\r\nmanuscript-dealers in Venice fixed their place of business in the most\r\nfrequented parts of the city--the Bridge of the Rialto, and the Plaza\r\nof S. Mark.\r\n\r\nThe trade of the Italian dealers in manuscripts was not brought to an\r\nimmediate close by the introduction of printing. The older scholars\r\nstill preferred the manuscript form for their books, and found it\r\ndifficult to divest themselves of the impression that the less costly\r\nprinted volumes were suited only for the requirements of the vulgar\r\nherd. There are even, as Kirchhoff points out,[345] instances of\r\nscribes preparing their manuscripts from printed “copy,” and there are\r\nexamples of these manuscript copies of printed books being made with\r\nsuch literalness as to include the imprint of the printer.\r\n\r\nThe work of Aldus (continued with scholarly enterprise later by such\r\nmen as Froben of Basel and Estienne of Paris) in the printing of Greek\r\ntexts, although begun as early as 1495, and although exercising a\r\nvery wide influence upon the distribution of Greek literature, was\r\ninsufficient to supply the eager demand of the scholars, while not\r\nmany other printers were, in the early years of the exercise of the\r\nart, prepared to incur the very considerable risk and expense required\r\nfor the production of Greek fonts of type. The risk was, of course, by\r\nno means limited to the cost of the type; the printers of the earlier\r\nGreek books had themselves but slight familiarity with the literature\r\nof Greece, and they were obliged in many cases to confide the selection\r\nand the editing of their texts to editors to whom this literature was\r\nvery largely still a novelty. The printers hardly knew what books\r\nto select and they had no adequate data upon which to base business\r\ncalculations as to the extent of the demand that could be looked for\r\nfor any particular book. The feeling that they were working in the dark\r\nwas, therefore, a very natural one.\r\n\r\nIt was on this ground that, while printing-presses were, during the\r\ncentury after 1450, multiplying rapidly through Europe, the printing\r\nof Greek books continued to be for a large portion of the period an\r\nexceptional class of undertakings, and work was still found for scribes\r\nwho could be trusted to make accurate transcripts of Greek codices.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff gives the names of the following Italian manuscript-dealers\r\nand scribes whose scholarly activity during the latter half of the\r\nfifteenth century was especially important: Antonius Dazilas, Cæsar\r\nStrategus, Constantius Librarius, Andreas Vergetius, and Antonius\r\nEparchus. The latter made various journeys to the East in search of\r\nmanuscripts. The fact that the dealers in manuscripts very rarely\r\nplaced their own names on the copies of the texts sent out from their\r\nwork-shops has, in a large number of cases, prevented these names from\r\nbeing preserved for future record. The names that have come into record\r\nare in the main such as have been referred to in the correspondence of\r\ntheir scholarly friends and clients. I quote a few of these references\r\nfrom the lists given by Kirchhoff:\r\n\r\nIn Bologna the oldest _librarius_ whose work is referred to is\r\nViliaric, who was called an _antiquarius_, and whose shop was open in\r\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century. In a manuscript, previously\r\nreferred to, containing a treatise of Paul Orosius, originally written\r\nin the seventh century, and from which this copy was transcribed early\r\nin the thirteenth, there is at the end an inscription, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Confectus codex in statione magistri Viliaric antiquarii,\r\n  Ora pro me scriptore, sic dominum habeas protectorem._[346]\r\n\r\n(This codex was completed in the stall of Master Viliaric, bookseller;\r\npray for (the soul of) me, the scribe, and you shall have the Lord for\r\nyour protector.)\r\n\r\nThis codex seems to have been prepared, according to the usual\r\nuniversity practice, for hire, as on the sixteenth page there is noted\r\nthe memorandum, “this quaternio has five sheets.”\r\n\r\nIn 1247, Nicolaus is recorded as being the _stationarius\r\nuniversitatis_, and in the same year a certain Johannes Cambii is\r\nrecorded as a _stationarius librorum_; and Minghinus as a _stationarius\r\npeciarum_. Here we have in one year record of three classes of scribes\r\nbeing at work. They were all noted as being doctors of the law, and\r\nthey all appear on the list of persons exempt from military service.\r\n\r\nLater in the same century, a certain Cervotti, who had inherited from\r\na deceased brother a collection of books, undertook to use these\r\nfor profit by offering them for hire. The list of the books, drawn\r\nup by the notary Noscimpax, has been preserved, and includes twenty\r\ndifferent works. Certain of these are collections of the university\r\nlectures in the Faculty of law, and the others have also, in the main,\r\nto do with the subject of jurisprudence. The first book on the list\r\nis _Diversitates Dominorum_, and the last _Margarita Gallacerti_,\r\nwhich latter does not appear properly to belong to the subject of\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1400, there is reference to a scribe named Moses and\r\nspecified as a Jew, which, in view of the university regulations\r\npreviously referred to prohibiting the sale of books by Jews or to\r\nJews, is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe entry appears at the close of a manuscript of Bartholomæus\r\nBrixiensis:\r\n\r\n_Emi hunc librum anno domini MCCCC die XXI. Mensis novembris a Moysi\r\nJudeo pro viii. florenes._\r\n\r\nKirchhoff is of opinion that Moses must have been a travelling pedlar,\r\nas it is difficult to believe that a Jew could have at that time\r\nsecured the post of a licensed university scribe.[347]\r\n\r\nIn Verona, there is reference to a certain Bonaventura, who is recorded\r\nas a _scriptor_, and who seems to have occasionally utilised for his\r\nmanuscript work the hand of a woman. An inscription on one of the\r\nmanuscripts by Bonaventura, quoted by Endlicher, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Dextra scriptoris careat gravitate doloris.\r\n  Detur pro penna scriptori pulchra puella._[348]\r\n\r\nIn Florence, the earliest _librarius_ of note was probably Johannes\r\nAretinus, whose work continued during the years between 1375-1417.\r\nAmbrosius Camaldulensis, who had so much to do with books and with\r\nliterature, takes pains, in a letter written in 1391, to send a cordial\r\ngreeting to the _librarius_ Aretinus.[349] Bandini prints a letter\r\nof Petrarch’s in which the latter refers to Aretinus as a friend for\r\nwhom he has a high regard and as a man of exceptional knowledge and\r\nclearness of insight, and specifies, as works that he valued highly,\r\nnine manuscripts which had been written by the hand of Aretinus.\r\nThese included Aristotle’s treatise on Ethics, several Essays of\r\nCicero, the Histories of Livy, Cicero’s Orations, Barbari on Marriage,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff gives a list of fourteen other Florentine _librarii_, whose\r\nwork extended over the years between 1410 and 1480. The latter date is\r\nsixteen years later than the introduction of the printing-press into\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy by far of these manuscript-dealers of Florence\r\nwas Philippi Vespasiano, who has been previously referred to, and\r\nwho is to be ranked not only as the most important publisher of the\r\nmanuscript period, but as one of the great scholars of his time, and\r\nas a man whose friendship was cherished by not a few of the leaders of\r\nthought during the earlier period of the Renaissance. In one of the\r\nFlorentine collections has been preserved a number of letters written\r\nto Vespasiano by his scholarly friends between the years 1446 and\r\n1463, and these letters show how honoured a position he held in the\r\ngeneration of his time. He was, in fact, in character and in ambition,\r\nas well as in the nature of his work, a worthy predecessor of Aldus,\r\nand he lived long enough himself to have seen some of the productions\r\nof the Aldine Press.\r\n\r\nIn his earlier years, Vespasiano was for a time secretary to Cardinal\r\nBranda in Rome, and it is during this time that he devoted himself\r\nearnestly to classic studies. It was while he was in Rome that he\r\nbegan work upon a literary undertaking of his own, which comprised a\r\nseries of Memoirs of the noteworthy men of his time with whom he had\r\ncome into relations. The Medici, Duke Borso of Ferrara, and other of\r\nthe scholarly nobles made large use of Vespasiano’s collections of\r\nmanuscripts and facilities for producing authentic transcripts.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the Italian dealers whose agents were actively at work\r\nin Greece and in Asia Minor in the collecting of manuscripts, and the\r\nclients to whom he supplied such manuscripts included correspondents\r\nin Paris, Basel, Vienna, and Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn the Bodleian Library in Oxford is a codex containing certain works\r\nof Cyprian, on the first sheet of which is inscribed:\r\n\r\n_Vespasianus librarius Florentinus hunc librum Florentiæ transcribendum\r\ncuravit._ (Vespasian, a Florentine _librarius_, had this book\r\ntranscribed at Florence.)\r\n\r\nAnother manuscript in the same collection, containing a commentary on\r\nsome comedies of Terence, is inscribed as follows:\r\n\r\n_Vespasianus librarius Florentinus fecit scribi Florentiæ._ (Vespasian,\r\na Florentine _librarius_, had this book written in Florence.)\r\n\r\nBoth codices are beautiful examples of the best manuscript work of the\r\nperiod.[350]\r\n\r\nThere are various references of the time showing that manuscripts\r\nwhich bore the stamp of Vespasiano were not only beautiful in their\r\nform, but possessed probably a higher authority than the work of any\r\nother manuscript-dealer of the age for completeness and for accuracy.\r\nHe took contracts for the production of great libraries, and it is\r\nrecorded that, in preparing for Cosimo de’ Medici a collection of two\r\nhundred works, he employed forty-five scribes for a term of twenty-two\r\nmonths.[351] Vespasiano died in 1496, one year later than the\r\nestablishment in Venice of the Aldine Press.\r\n\r\nAgnolo da Sandro is described as a _bidellus_, a manuscript-dealer,\r\nin Florence as late as 1498, at which time the trade in manuscripts\r\nmust already have begun very seriously to diminish. Niccolo di Giunta,\r\nwho was active in the manuscript trade in Florence towards the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, is famous as having been the founder of the\r\nfamily of Giunta or Junta, which later took such an important part in\r\nprinting and publishing undertakings in Italy.\r\n\r\nIn Perugia, the first record of a manuscript-publisher bears date as\r\nlate as 1430. The name is Bontempo, and his inscription appears on a\r\nparchment copy of an _Infortiatum_.\r\n\r\nWhile there are various references to manuscript-dealers in Milan of an\r\nearly date, the first inscription bears date as late as 1452. The name\r\nis Melchoir, who is described as a “dealer of note.” Filelfo speaks of\r\nMelchoir as having copies of Cicero’s _Letters_ for sale at ten ducats\r\neach.[352]\r\n\r\nPaolo Soardo, who was in business between 1470 and 1480, is described\r\nas an apothecary and also as a dealer in _delicatessen_, but he seems\r\nto have added to his employment that of a manifolder and seller of\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nJacobus Antiquarius speaks of having purchased from Paolo in 1480 a\r\nRoman history for the sum of one _aureus_. In Padua, Jacob, a Jew,\r\nsucceeded, notwithstanding the university regulations against dealing\r\nin manuscripts by Jews, in carrying on between 1455 and 1460 a business\r\nin the sale of manuscripts. His inscription appears on a number of\r\nclassical codices of the time, and in a manuscript of Horace, dating\r\nfrom the twelfth century, the owner makes reference that he purchased\r\nthe same in 1458 from Jacob, the Hebrew _librarius_.[353]\r\n\r\nThe records of Ferrara give the names of Carnerio, _bibliopola_, and of\r\nseveral others as doing business in manuscripts between 1440 and 1490.\r\n\r\nIn Rome the records of 1454 speak of Giovanni and Francisco as\r\n_cartolaji_ and _librarii_, that is to say, dealers in paper and also\r\nin manuscripts. In that year these dealers had for sale among their\r\nthings, _Letters of Cicero_ (without which work no well regulated\r\nmanuscript-dealer’s collection appears to have been complete) and the\r\nworks of Celsus. A copy of the latter was bought for Vespasiano for\r\nthe sum of twenty ducats. There is record during the same year of a\r\ncertain Spannocchia who also had Cicero’s _Letters_ for sale.\r\n\r\nIn Genoa there were at this time one or two manuscript-dealers, but, as\r\nbefore stated, the readers and scholars of Genoa appear for the most\r\npart to have supplied themselves from Florence.\r\n\r\nThe most important trade in manuscripts during the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, as was the case during the fifteenth century with\r\nthe trade in printed books, was carried on in Venice and Florence. As\r\nearly as 1390 the inscription of Gabriel Ravenna, _librarius_, appears\r\nin a copy of Seneca’s _Tragedies_.[354] Kirchhoff is of opinion that\r\nGabriel conducted, during the last fifteen years of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, an important work-shop for the production of manuscripts.\r\n\r\nA year or two later, occurs the name of Michael, a German _librarius_,\r\nbut it is possible that Michael’s work was more nearly that of a\r\nsecretary than of a manuscript-dealer. As Kirchhoff points out,\r\nit is not always easy at this stage of the trade in manuscripts,\r\nto distinguish between the inscriptions of the manuscript-dealers\r\ncertifying to the correctness of the copy sent out from their shops,\r\nand the inscriptions of the scribes or secretaries who, having\r\ncompleted for this or that employer specific copies of the works\r\nrequired, added their names as a record on the final sheet.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Johannes Aurispa, by far the most\r\nimportant of the manuscript-dealers of his time and possibly of the\r\nentire Middle Ages. Aurispa was born in 1369 in Sicily. The earlier\r\nyears of his life were passed in Constantinople, where he appears to\r\nhave held a position of some importance in connection with the Court.\r\nWhile in Constantinople, he began to make collections of manuscripts,\r\nand he organised there a staff of skilled scribes. In 1423, at the\r\ninvitation of his friends, Ambrosius Camaldulensis and Niccolo\r\nde’ Niccoli, he came to Florence, bringing with him an invaluable\r\ncollection of 238 manuscripts.\r\n\r\nTo this store he afterwards added, while in Florence, a further lot of\r\ncodices which he had had sent from Constantinople to Messina. At this\r\ntime, his interest in the collection of manuscripts appears to have\r\nbeen a matter of scholarship merely and of sympathy with the efforts\r\nof certain Florentine scholars whom he came to know, to secure the\r\nmaterial for their classical studies.\r\n\r\nLater, however, in connection, doubtless, with the many applications\r\nthat came to him for transcripts of his codices, he decided to organise\r\na business as a bookseller and publisher. Before taking this course, he\r\nhad, it appears, sought a position as instructor, first in Florence and\r\nafterwards in Bologna and in Ferrara, but had not succeeded in finding\r\nthe kind of a post that suited him.\r\n\r\nPart of the evidence of his change of mind comes to us through letters\r\nfrom Filelfo, whose keen scholarly interest brought him into close\r\nrelations with men having to do with literary production. Filelfo\r\nwrites to Aurispa, in 1440:\r\n\r\n_Totus es in librorum mercatura, sed in lectura mallem. Quid enim\r\nprodest libros quotidie, nunc emere, nunc vendere, legere vere\r\nnunquam!_ (You are completely absorbed in the occupation of trading\r\nbooks, but I should choose that of reading them. For what does it\r\nprofit you to buy and sell books every day if you never have time for\r\ntheir perusal.)\r\n\r\nAnd again in 1441:\r\n\r\n_Sed ex tua ista taberna libraria nullus unquam prodit codex, nisi cum\r\nquæstu._[355] (No book ever leaves your book-shop, except at a profit\r\nto you.)\r\n\r\nThe publishing undertakings of Aurispa were devoted almost entirely to\r\nworks of classical literature. Among the authors whose names appear\r\neither in the lists of books offered by him or in the correspondence of\r\nhis friends and clients, are as follows:\r\n\r\nPhilo Judæus, Strabo, Theophrastus, Demosthenes, Xenophon, Proculus,\r\nHomer, Aristarchus, Athenæus, Sophocles, Æschylus, Pindar, Oppian,\r\nProclus, Eusebius, Gregory, Aristotle, Plutarch, Plotinus, Lucian, Dio\r\nCassio, Diodorus, and other Greek authors. The Latin writers included\r\nCicero (of necessity), Virgil, Pliny, Quintilian, Macrobius, Apicius,\r\nand Antonius.\r\n\r\nAurispa seems to have enjoyed the confidence and friendship of all\r\nthe noted Italian scholars of his time, and the letters of his\r\ncorrespondents speak with very cordial appreciation as well of the\r\nimportance of his services to literature, as of the extent of the\r\naccuracy of his own scholarship. The only correspondent with whom\r\nhe appears to have had any trouble was Filelfi, but if Filelfi had\r\nnot managed to have friction with Aurispa, the bookseller would have\r\nbeen an exception among the contemporaries of this irritable and\r\nself-sufficient scholar.\r\n\r\nIn 1450, being then well advanced in years, Aurispa gave up his\r\nbusiness undertakings, took priestly orders, and lived thereafter as a\r\n_scriba apostolicus_, dividing his time between Ferrara and Rome. He\r\ndeclined tempting offers, made through his friend Panormita, to join\r\nthe literary circle of King Alphonso which had been brought together\r\nabout the Court in Naples.\r\n\r\nAfter Aurispa’s death, Filelfo gave to his son-in-law, Sabbatinus, a\r\nvery cordial word of appreciation of the services and of the character\r\nof the publisher. A portion of the manuscripts belonging to Aurispa’s\r\ncollection was purchased in 1461 by Duke Borso of Ferrara for two\r\nhundred ducats.\r\n\r\nA large collection of manuscripts was, however, in Aurispa’s\r\npossession at the time of his death, and these were taken charge of by\r\nBartholomæus Facius, and, after various vicissitudes, many of them have\r\nsince found place in existing collections of Florence, Venice, Vienna,\r\nParis, and London. A selection of the letters between Aurispa and his\r\nnear friend Camaldulensis has also been preserved.\r\n\r\n=Books in Spain.=--At the time when the great manuscript-dealers\r\nof Venice and Florence were carrying on business with the literary\r\ncentres of France, Germany, and England, they had some dealings\r\nalso with Spain; but their correspondence was practically limited\r\nto the University of Salamanca, which had been founded about 1220.\r\nThe literary activities of Spain during the fifteenth century were\r\ncertainly much less important than those of either Italy or France.\r\nThey were of necessity seriously hampered by the long series of wars\r\nwith the Moors, while the final overthrow in 1492 of the Moorish\r\nkingdom of Granada doubtless had, as one of many results, a decidedly\r\nunfavourable influence upon the intellectual development and the\r\nliterary possibilities of the Peninsula. For two centuries or more\r\nthe scholars of the Moorish kingdom had busied themselves in making\r\ncollections of Arabic literature, while of not a few of the more\r\nnoteworthy works they caused to be prepared versions in Latin, by means\r\nof which the books were made available for the use of instructors and\r\nstudents in Salerno, Bologna, Padua, and Paris. It was the case also\r\nthat the first knowledge of certain Greek authors came to the scholars\r\nof Europe through the Latin translations which were produced in Cordova\r\nfrom the Arabic versions. The Moorish scholars thus became a connecting\r\nlink for the transmission to the Western world of the philosophy and\r\nlearning of the East. Until its conquest and practical destruction by\r\nthe Spaniards in 1236, Cordova had been not only the political capital\r\nbut the centre of the intellectual life of the Moorish kingdom, so that\r\nit was spoken of as the Athens of the West. At the close of the tenth\r\ncentury it is said to have contained nearly one million inhabitants. In\r\nconnection with the work of its university and of the great library,\r\na large body of skilled scribes were busied with the manifolding of\r\nmanuscripts, and there appears to have been a regular exchange of\r\nmanuscripts between Cordova and Baghdad.\r\n\r\nIn the year 995, Thafar Al-baghdádé, the chief of the scribes of his\r\ntime, came from Baghdad and settled in Cordova. The Khalif Al-hakem\r\ntook him into his service and employed him in transcribing books.\r\nThe Khalif surpassed every one of his predecessors in the love of\r\nliterature and of the sciences, which he himself cultivated with\r\nsuccess and fostered in his dominions. Through his influence, Andalusia\r\nbecame a great market to which the literary productions of every clime\r\nwere immediately brought for sale. He employed merchants and agents to\r\ncollect books for him in distant countries, remitting for the purpose\r\nlarge sums of money from the treasury, until, says the chronicler, “the\r\nnumber of books in Andalusia exceeded all calculation.” The Khalif\r\nsent presents of money to celebrated authors in the East with a view\r\nto encourage the publication of works or to secure the first copies of\r\nthese. Hearing, for instance, that Abú-l-faraj of Ispahán had written\r\na book entitled _Kitábu-l-aghani_ (_The Book of Songs_), he sent him\r\na thousand dinars of pure gold, in consideration of which he received\r\na copy of the work before it had been published in Persia. He did the\r\nsame thing with Abú Bekr Al-abhari, who had published a commentary on\r\nthe _Mokhtassar_.\r\n\r\nAl-hakem also collected and employed in his own palace the most skilful\r\nmen of his time in the arts of transcribing, binding and illuminating\r\nbooks. The great library that he brought together remained in the\r\npalace of Cordova, until, during a siege of the city by the Berbers,\r\nHájib Wadheh, a freedman of Al-mansúr, ordered portions of the books\r\nto be sold, the remainder being shortly afterwards plundered and\r\ndestroyed on the taking of the city. The extent of the collection\r\nis indicated by the description of the catalogue. In the Tekmílah,\r\nIbun-l-abbáns is quoted by Al-Makkari as saying that the catalogue\r\ncomprised forty-four volumes, each volume containing twenty sheets.\r\nMakkari estimates that the library contained no less that four hundred\r\nthousand volumes. It is possible that this number was over-estimated,\r\nat least, if we are to believe the statement of Ibun-l-abbar that the\r\nKhalif Al-hakem had himself read every book in the collection, writing\r\non the fly-leaf the dates of his perusal and details concerning the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nMakkari gives a long list of famous authors who flourished in Andalusia\r\nduring the reign of Al-hakem, their productions including works in\r\nlaw, medicine, history, topography, language, and poetry. One of the\r\nhistorians, Al-tári-khí, was a paper merchant, and was accordingly\r\nknown by the name of Al-Warrak. I do not find record of the names of\r\nany dealers in books or any account of the means employed for their\r\ndistribution.[356]\r\n\r\n=The Manuscript Trade in France.=--While, in Italy, the more important\r\npart of the trade in manuscripts was carried on outside of the\r\nuniversity circles, in France the university retained in the hands\r\nof its own authorities the control and supervision of the work of\r\nthe manuscript-dealers; and the book-trade of the country, not only\r\nduring the manuscript period, but for many years after the introduction\r\nof printing, was very directly associated with the university\r\norganisation. The record of the production and of the trade in books\r\ncarried on by the _stationarii_, _librarii_, and the printer-publishers\r\nof the university is presented in the chapter on the Making of Books\r\nin the Universities.\r\n\r\nDuring its earlier years, the trade in manuscripts was limited\r\npractically to the city of Paris. The work of the official university\r\nscribes in Paris was very similar to that which has already been\r\nreferred to for Bologna. It appears, however, that, in accordance with\r\nthe Parisian methods, there was less insistence upon the practice of\r\nhiring manuscripts, either complete or in divisions, and there was an\r\nearlier development of the practice of making an absolute sale of the\r\ntexts required.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff traces the beginning of the manuscript-trade back to the\r\nsecond half of the eleventh century. He says that it is not clear\r\nwhether the earlier dealers were able to devote themselves exclusively\r\nto the business of selling books, or whether, as he thinks it more\r\nprobable, they associated this business with some other occupation.\r\nJean de Garland, who compiled a kind of technological directory or list\r\nof industries carried on in Paris in 1060, says: _Paravisus est locus\r\nubi libri scholarium vendentur_.[357] He is apparently referring to\r\nthe Place near the Cathedral Church, which later became the centre of\r\nthe Parisian book-trade. Peter of Blois, writing, in the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century, to an instructor in jurisprudence in Paris, makes a\r\nmore definite reference to the Parisian manuscript-dealers. He speaks\r\nof the great collections of valuable books which the Parisian dealers\r\nhave for sale, and laments the narrowness of his purse which prevents\r\nhim from purchasing many things which have tempted him.[358]\r\n\r\nBulæus, in his _History of the University of Paris_, published in 1665,\r\nmaintains that as early as 1174, the manuscript-dealers of Paris formed\r\na part of the organisation of the university, and that their work had\r\nbeen brought fully under the regulation of the university authorities.\r\nThe university statistics, before the thirteenth century, do not,\r\nhowever, appear fully to bear out this contention. The first statutes\r\nwhich give detailed regulations concerning the book-trade bear date\r\nas late as 1275. These statutes specify what texts and what number of\r\ncopies of each text the licensed booksellers should keep in stock, and\r\ngive a schedule, as was done in Bologna and Padua, of the prices at\r\nwhich the loans and sales should be made.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff is of opinion that, prior to the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the book-trade connected with the university, while it\r\nhad already assumed considerable proportions, had not been brought\r\nthoroughly under university control. With this control came also as an\r\neffect, the privileges which attached to the dealers as members of the\r\nuniversity body, and there is no evidence that the booksellers enjoyed\r\nthese privileges before 1250. Depping takes the ground, that during\r\nthe fifteenth century the sale of books in Paris was not sufficient to\r\nconstitute a business in itself, and that all dealers in books had some\r\nother occupation or means of support, and interested themselves in the\r\nsale of manuscripts only as an additional occupation.[359]\r\n\r\nIt appears hardly likely, however, that manuscript-dealers should be\r\nable to secure immunity from the general tax, which fell upon nearly\r\nall other classes of dealers, on the ground of the importance of\r\ntheir trade for education, unless they were able to show that they\r\nwere actively engaged in such trade. The regulation quoted by Depping\r\nspecifies among the free citizens of the city of Paris who were not\r\nliable to the King’s tax,--_libraires parcheminiers_, _enlumineurs_,\r\n_escriipveins_. It was evidently the intention of the framers of the\r\nlaw to include under the exemption all dealers upon whose trade the\r\npreparation and sale of manuscripts was directly dependent. Under this\r\nheading were included, of necessity, the scribes, the illuminators (who\r\nadded to the text of the scribes the artistic decorations and initial\r\nletters), and (most important of the three) the dealers in parchment.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the booksellers are named in this schedule separately\r\nfrom the scribes is an indication of the existence of a bookselling\r\ntrade of sufficient importance to call for the work of capitalists\r\nemploying in the preparation of their manuscripts the services of\r\nthe scribes and of the other workmen required. Work of this kind can\r\nproperly be classified as publishing.\r\n\r\nThe dealer was himself prohibited from making purchase of a manuscript\r\nleft in his hands until this had been offered for sale during the term\r\nof not less than one month. Record was to be kept of the name of the\r\npurchaser and of the price received.\r\n\r\nThe requirement that the price obtained for a manuscript should be\r\nrecorded, has secured the preservation, on a number of manuscripts of\r\nthe time, of a convenient record of their market value.\r\n\r\nIn a collection of sermons dating from the latter part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, for instance, is the record, “This book was sold for 20\r\nParisian sols.” In a text of _Ovid_ of about the same time is noted\r\nsimply the price,--6 sols, Parisian.[360]\r\n\r\nNewly prepared transcripts could not be licensed for renting until\r\nthey had been examined and passed as correct by the officials, and\r\nuntil their renting prices had been placed on record. No new work\r\ncould be included in the lists of the _stationarii_ until license for\r\nthe same had been secured. At this date, the usual term of rental of\r\na manuscript was one week, and an additional charge could be made if\r\nthe manuscript was held in excess of that time. In case a member of\r\nthe university had transcribed an incorrect or incomplete manuscript,\r\nthe _stationarius_ was liable to him for damages to cover his wasted\r\nlabour. According to the general practice, the hirer of a manuscript\r\nwas obliged to deposit a pledge for the same, which pledge could be\r\ndisposed of by the _stationarius_ after the term of one year.\r\n\r\nIn the schedule presented by Chevillier of manuscripts licensed in\r\nthe early part of the thirteenth century, the prices specified cover\r\nonly the rates for renting. Chevillier points out that there is in\r\nthis schedule no indication of the division of the manuscripts into\r\n_pecias_, the practice which was, as we have seen, the usual routine in\r\nthe Italian universities.[361]\r\n\r\nAn appraisal of the books contained in the library of the Sorbonne in\r\nthe year 1292 gives a value of 3812 livres, 10 sous, 8 deniers.[362]\r\n\r\nThe regulations concerning the sale of works on commission were\r\nrenewed in 1300, with provisions which must have rendered this class\r\nof business not only unremunerative but peculiarly troublesome. Such\r\na sale could be made only in the presence of two witnesses. No other\r\nbookseller was at liberty to purchase the book, excepting with the\r\npermission and in the presence of the original owner. Before a sale was\r\nmade to a bookseller, the manuscript must be allowed to remain exposed\r\nfor sale not less than four days in the library of the Dominican\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nExceptions to the above regulations were permitted under the express\r\nauthority of the Rector of the university in case the original\r\npossessor of the manuscript might be in immediate need of money, a\r\ncondition which probably obtained in a large number of cases.\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of these regulations appears to have been the\r\nprevention of any undue increase in the market price or selling value\r\nof manuscripts, or the “cornering of the market” on the part of the\r\nmanuscript-dealers in connection with texts which might be in demand.\r\nExisting regulations of this kind tended, however, naturally to fall\r\ninto desuetude.\r\n\r\nIn 1411, an ordinance of Charles VI. made fresh reference to the\r\nnecessity of such supervision, mainly on the ground of the convenience\r\nof tracing stolen manuscripts or unlicensed manuscripts.\r\n\r\nIn 1342, the _librarii_ were permitted to increase their selling\r\ncommission from four deniers to six deniers in the case of manuscripts\r\nsold by them for clients who were not themselves members of the\r\nuniversity. Kirchhoff points out, however, that this commission could\r\nby no means have represented the actual charges made. The University\r\nof Paris claimed the authority to license its _librarii_, and to carry\r\non business not only in Paris but throughout France. _Librarii_ from\r\nwithout were, however, strictly prohibited from carrying on business in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThere were in Paris, in addition to the _stationarii_ and _librarii_,\r\na certain number of unlicensed dealers who were not members of the\r\nuniversity, and who might be classed as book pedlars. While these book\r\npedlars enjoyed no university privileges, their business was subjected\r\nto the supervision of the university authorities. It was the purpose\r\nof the regulations to prevent dealers of this kind from taking part in\r\nany higher grade book business. They were, for instance, forbidden to\r\nsell any volume for a higher price than ten sous, which, of necessity,\r\nlimited their trade practically to chap-books, broadsides, etc. They\r\nwere also forbidden to trade in any covered shops, their business being\r\ncarried on in open booths. In case they were at any time found to be\r\ntrenching upon the business of the licensed or certified book-dealers\r\n(_libraires jurés_), they forfeited promptly their permits as book\r\npedlars.\r\n\r\nIn 1323, the Paris School was the most important in Europe for\r\ntheological studies, as that of Bologna was the authority on\r\njurisprudence, and that of Padua for medicine; and the trade of the\r\nParis booksellers was, therefore, largely devoted to theological\r\nwritings. It is partly on this ground that the records of the\r\nmonasteries in which there was scholarly and literary activity make\r\nmore frequent reference during this century to Paris as a book centre\r\nthan to any one of the Italian cities. When, for instance, King Wenzell\r\nII. of Bohemia, at the time of the founding of the Cistercian abbey of\r\nKönigsaal, presented two hundred marks of silver for the organisation\r\nof its library, the Abbot Conrad had, he reports, no other course to\r\ntake than to travel to Paris in order to purchase the books. This was\r\nin the year 1327.[363] Johann Gerson, writing in 1395 to Petrus de\r\nAlliaco, speaks of the wealth of the literary stores available at this\r\ntime in Paris. The list that he gives as an example of these treasures\r\nis devoted exclusively to theological works.\r\n\r\nWhile it is difficult to understand from the evidence available\r\nwhat machinery may have been in existence during the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries for the distribution of the books, there are\r\nvarious references to indicate that such distribution took place\r\npromptly over a very considerable territory. The anonymous author of\r\na polemical tract, written in order to point out the errors of some\r\nheretical production, says:\r\n\r\n_Is autem erroneus liber positus fuit publice ad exemplandum Parisius\r\nanno domini 1254. Unde certum est, quod jam publice predicaretur, nisi\r\nboni prelati et predicatores impedirent._[364]\r\n\r\n(In Paris in the year of our Lord 1254, this heretical book was openly\r\ngiven to the scribes to be copied. Whence it is evident what manner of\r\ndoctrine would now be set forth to the public had not good priests and\r\npreachers interfered.)\r\n\r\nKirchhoff is of the opinion that there began to be at this time\r\nin connection with the work of the contemporary authors a kind of\r\npublishing arrangement under which the author handed over to the\r\n_stationarii_ or to the _librarii_ his literary production for\r\nmultiplication and for publication, either through renting, through\r\nsale, or in both methods. He finds in the manuscript of a tract by\r\nGerson, which was given to the public in the year 1417, a notice to the\r\neffect that this was published in Paris under the instructions of the\r\nauthor and under the license of Magister Johannus, Cancellarius.[365]\r\n\r\nThe work of the manuscript-dealers was carried on in booths or shops in\r\nvarious open places, but as a rule in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe churches. Certain booths were to be found, however, on the bridges\r\nand by the courts of justice; and a neighbourhood particularly resorted\r\nto by the booksellers was the Rue Neuve Notre Dame, where, in the year\r\n1292, out of eight licensed book-sellers, no less than three had their\r\nwork-shops. On the bridge Neuf Notre Dame, there were at the time\r\nof its falling, in 1499, a number of booksellers, three of whom are\r\nrecorded as having lost their stock through the accident. The places\r\nselected by the earlier dealers in manuscripts became later the centre\r\nof the Parisian trade in printed books.\r\n\r\nAs a result of their membership in the university, the dealers in\r\nmanuscripts shared in the exemption from the taxation enjoyed by the\r\nuniversity body. The royal tax collectors persisted, however, from\r\ntime to time in ignoring this right of exemption, and it was therefore\r\nnecessary at different periods to secure fresh enactments from the\r\nroyal ordinances in order to confirm the privilege. An example of\r\nsuch an ordinance is that issued by Philip the Fair, in 1307. In the\r\ncases in which the university placed an impost upon its members for\r\nany special purpose, the manuscript dealers were, of course, obliged\r\nto assume their share of such impost. At the time of their acceptance\r\nas official or licensed dealers, they had to pay a fee, in the first\r\nplace of four sous, but after 1467 of eight sous. For the privilege\r\nof keeping an open shop, the fee was twenty-four sous. A further fee\r\nof eight sous was payable for each apprentice, and a weekly payment\r\nof twelve deniers payable for each workman. These fees went into the\r\ntreasury of the booksellers’ corporation.\r\n\r\nAfter 1456, under the enactment of the congregation of the university,\r\neach manuscript dealer and paper dealer was called upon to pay to the\r\nRector of the university at the time of his acceptance and license a\r\n_scutum_ of gold.\r\n\r\nThe four _taxatores_, the officials charged with the supervision of\r\nthe fees for the booksellers’ guild (usually the four senior or most\r\nimportant members of the guild), were also charged with the selection\r\nor approval of new members and with the supervision of the proper\r\ncarrying out of the various regulations controlling the organisations\r\nof the guild. In the earlier period of the work, such censorship as\r\nwas found necessary concerning the books to be published was exercised\r\nthrough these four taxators. They were also the official representative\r\nbody of the university guild.\r\n\r\nIn case any member of the guild suffered injury from unauthorised\r\ncompetition, the guild had the power to suspend the business operation\r\nwith the person charged with committing the injury, until the complaint\r\ncould be passed upon. In case the rules of the corporation had been\r\nbroken, the corporation appears to have had the power, at least up\r\nto the beginning of the fifteenth century, of withdrawing the trade\r\nprivilege or license.\r\n\r\nThe taxators or _principales jurati_, as they were sometimes called,\r\nhad power to proceed not only to supervise the business undertaking of\r\nthe members of the guild, but were also authorised to take measures\r\nagainst the outside or unlicensed booksellers and to proceed, if\r\nnecessary, even to the point of seizure and confiscation of their\r\ngoods. In carrying out such measures, they were empowered to call upon\r\nthe university bedels for co-operation.\r\n\r\nThese unlicensed dealers or book pedlars, as they increased in numbers,\r\nnaturally attempted to withdraw themselves from the jurisdiction and\r\nsupervision of the university authorities. An ordinance of Charles VI.,\r\ndated June 20, 1411, confirms specifically the right of control over\r\nthe entire book-trade, and prohibits pedlars, dealers, hucksters, etc.,\r\nfrom taking part in the selling of manuscripts, “of which business\r\nthey could have no understanding.” The edict went on to specify that\r\nthe carrying on of the book business by ignorant and irresponsible\r\ndealers not only caused injury to the licensed book-dealers, but was\r\na wrong upon the public, in that it furthered the circulation of\r\nincorrect, incomplete, and fraudulent manuscripts. This ordinance was\r\ndoubtless issued at the instance of the book-dealers’ guild, but it\r\nis evident that it was not strictly carried out, as from year to year\r\nthere are renewed complaints of the competition of these ignorant and\r\nirresponsible book pedlars.\r\n\r\nIt was considered important, in order to insure the proper control by\r\nthe university over the book-trade and the interests of the scholars\r\nwho depended upon the book-dealers for their text-books, that the\r\ntrade in the materials used in the manifolding of books should also be\r\nstrictly supervised. The special purpose of the university authorities\r\nwas to prevent any “cornering of the market” in parchment, and to\r\ninsure that the supply of this should be regular and uniform in price.\r\n\r\nUnder the ordinance of 1291, the dealers in parchment were forbidden\r\nto keep any secret stores of the same, but were obliged to keep on file\r\nwith the managers of the book guild the record of the stock carried by\r\nthem from month to month. The parchment-dealers licensed to do business\r\nin Paris were forbidden to sell parchment to dealers from outside of\r\nParis. On the first day of the Trade Fair, when foreign dealers brought\r\nparchment to Paris for sale, the Parisian dealers were forbidden\r\nthemselves to make purchases, this day being reserved for such\r\npurchases as the university officials might desire to make. In case,\r\nafter the first day of the Fair, a foreign dealer in parchment had\r\nbefore him more applications for his stock than could be supplied, and\r\namong the applicants there should be one representing the university,\r\nthe latter was to be served first. Outside of the time of the official\r\nFair, the Paris dealers in parchment were allowed to make purchases of\r\ntheir material only in the monastery of S. Mathurin.\r\n\r\nIn case between the times of the Fair a foreign dealer or manufacturer\r\nof parchment came to Paris, he was obliged to place his stock in\r\nthis same monastery and to give information concerning this deposit\r\nto the Rector of the university. The Rector sent a representative to\r\nexamine and to schedule the parchment, and the stock was priced by\r\nfour of the licensed parchment-dealers associated with the university.\r\nThe university authorities had then for twenty-four hours the first\r\nprivilege of purchase. This regulation was applied also to the\r\nparchment-trade carried on at the Fair of St. Germain.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the many renewed edicts and ordinances referring\r\nto this trade that it was not easy to carry out such regulations\r\neffectively, and that much friction and dissatisfaction was produced by\r\nthem. It seems probable also that, with the trade in parchment as in\r\nother trades, the attempt to secure uniformity of price, irrespective\r\nof the conditions of manufacture or of the market, had the effect not\r\ninfrequently of lessening the supply and of causing sales to be made\r\nsurreptitiously at increased prices.\r\n\r\nAfter the use of parchment had in large part been replaced by paper\r\nmade of linen, the supplies of Paris came principally from Lombardy.\r\nLater, however, paper-mills were erected in France, the first being\r\nat Troyes and Esson. These earlier paper manufacturers were, like the\r\nbook-dealers in Paris, made free from tax. This exemption was contested\r\nfrom time to time by the farmers of the taxes and had to be renewed\r\nby successive ordinances. Later, the university associated with its\r\nbody, in the same manner as had been done with the parchment-dealers,\r\nthe manufacturers and dealers in paper, and confirmed them in the\r\npossession of the privileges previously enjoyed by the _librarii_ and\r\n_stationarii_. The privileges of the paper manufacturers extended,\r\nhowever, outside of Paris, which was, of course, not the case with the\r\n_librarii_.\r\n\r\nWhile, in connection with the requirements of the university and\r\nthe special privileges secured through university membership, the\r\nbook-trade of Paris and the trades associated with it secured a larger\r\nmeasure of importance as compared with the trade of the provinces than\r\nwas the case in either Italy or Germany, there came into existence as\r\nearly as the middle of the fourteenth century a considerable trade in\r\nmanuscripts in various provincial centres.\r\n\r\nIn Montpellier, the university was, as in Paris, a centre for\r\npublishing undertakings, but in Angers, Rouen, Orleans, and Toulouse,\r\nin which there are various references to book-dealers as early as\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth century, the trade must have been\r\nsupported by a public largely outside of the university organisation.\r\nThe statutes of Orleans and of Toulouse, dating from 1341, regulate the\r\nsupervision of the trade in manuscripts.\r\n\r\nIn Montpellier, there appears to have been, during the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century, a business in the loaning of the manuscripts\r\nand of manuscript _hefts_--_pecias_, similar to that already described\r\nin Bologna. The university authorities, usually the bedels, supervised\r\nthe correctness of the _pecias_ and prescribed the prices at which they\r\nshould be rented. The _stationarii_ who carried on this business and\r\nalso the _venditores librorum_ were members of the university body.\r\nThe sale of books on commission was also supervised under regulations\r\nsimilar to those obtaining in Bologna.\r\n\r\nNo _stationarius_ was at liberty to dispose of a work placed in his\r\nhands for sale (unless it belonged to a foreigner) until it had been\r\nexposed in his shop for at least six days, and had at least been three\r\ntimes offered for sale publicly in the auditorium. This offering for\r\nsale was cared for by the _banquerii_, who were the assistants or\r\ntenants of the rectors. These _banquerii_ were also authorised to carry\r\non the business of the loaning of _pecias_ under the same conditions\r\nas those that controlled the _stationarii_. They were also at liberty,\r\nafter the close of the term lectures, to sell their own supplies of\r\nmanuscripts (usually of course the copies of the official texts) at\r\npublic auction in the auditorium.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how, with a trade, of necessity, limited\r\nin extent, and the possible profits of which were so closely restricted\r\nby regulations, there could have been a living profit sufficient to\r\ntempt educated dealers to take up the work of the _stationarii_ or\r\n_librarii_.\r\n\r\nIt is probably the case, as Kirchhoff, Savigny, and others point\r\nout, that the actual results of the trade cannot be ascertained with\r\ncertainty from the texts of the regulations, and that there were\r\nvarious ways in which, in spite of these regulations, larger returns\r\ncould be secured for the work of the scholarly and enterprising\r\n_librarii_.\r\n\r\nAn ordinance issued in 1411 makes reference to booksellers buying\r\nand selling books both in French or in Latin and gives privilege\r\nto licensed booksellers to do such buying and selling at their\r\npleasure. This seems to have been an attempt to widen the range of the\r\nbook-trade, while reference to books in the vernacular indicates an\r\nincreasing demand for literature outside of the circles of instructors\r\nand students.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the fifteenth century, there was, among a number of\r\nthe nobles of families in France, a certain increase in the interest of\r\nliterature and in the taste for collecting elaborate, ornamented, and\r\ncostly manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe princely Houses of Burgundy and of Orleans are to be noted in this\r\nconnection, and particularly in Burgundy, the influence of the ducal\r\nfamily was of wide importance in furthering the development of the\r\ntrade in manuscripts and the production of literature.\r\n\r\nA large number of the manuscripts placed in these ducal family\r\nlibraries were evidently originally prepared by scribes having\r\nknowledge only of plain script, and the addition of the initial\r\nletters and of the illuminated head and tail pieces was made later\r\nby illuminators and designers attached to the ducal families. It\r\nwas to these latter that fell the responsibility of placing upon\r\nthe manuscripts the arms of the owners of the libraries. In case\r\nmanuscripts which had been inscribed with family arms came to change\r\nhands, it became necessary to replace these arms with those of the\r\nlater purchaser, and many of the illuminated manuscripts of the period\r\ngive evidence of such changing of the decorations, decorations which\r\ntook the place of the book-plate of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe taste for these elaborate illuminated manuscripts, each one of\r\nwhich, through the insertion of individual designs and of the family\r\narms, became identified with the personality and taste of its owner,\r\ncould not easily be set aside, after the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, by the new art of printing. As a matter of fact, therefore, it\r\nnot infrequently happened, towards the latter part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, that these noble collectors caused elaborate transcripts to\r\nbe made, by hand, of works which were already in print, rather than\r\nto place in their own collection books in the form in which ordinary\r\nbuyers could secure them.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1448, the number of certified _librarii_ in Paris had\r\nincreased to twenty-four.[366] Kirchhoff is of opinion that a certain\r\nportion at least of these _librarii_ carried on also other trades, but\r\nit is evident that there had come to be in these years, immediately\r\npreceding the introduction of the printing-press, a very considerable\r\ndevelopment in the demand for literature and in the book-trade of the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn 1489, the list of book-dealers and of those connected with the\r\nmanufacture of books who were exempt from taxation included twenty-four\r\n_librarii_, four dealers in parchment, four dealers in paper, seven\r\npaper manufacturers (having mills outside of Paris), two illuminators,\r\ntwo binders, and two licensed scribes.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, the list of _librarii_ free from taxation was\r\nreduced to seventeen. It is probable that those _librarii_ whose\r\nnames had been taken off the exemption list undertook a general book\r\nbusiness carried on outside of the university regulations, and were\r\nprobably able to secure returns more than sufficient to offset the loss\r\ncaused by the curtailing of their freedom from taxation and of their\r\nuniversity privileges.\r\n\r\nThis reduction in the number of manuscript-dealers who remained members\r\nof the corporation was, however, very promptly made up by including in\r\nthe corporation the newly introduced printers. As early as 1476, one of\r\nthe four officials of the guild was the printer Pasquier Bonhomme.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of the work of the scribes and the transfer of the\r\nbook-trade from their hands to those of the printers took place\r\ngradually after the year 1470, the printers being, as said, promptly\r\nincluded in the organisation of the guild. There must, however, have\r\nbeen, during the earlier years at least, not a little rivalry and\r\nbitterness between the two groups of dealers.\r\n\r\nAn instance of this rivalry is given in 1474, in which year a\r\n_librarius juratus_, named Herman von Stathoen (by birth a German),\r\ndied. According to the university regulation, his estate, valued at\r\n800 crowns of gold, (there being no heirs in the country) should have\r\nfallen to the university treasury. In addition to this property in\r\nParis, Stathoen was part owner of a book establishment in Mayence,\r\ncarried on by Schöffer & Henckis, and was unpopular with the Paris\r\ndealers generally on the ground of his foreign trade connections.\r\n\r\nContention was made on behalf of the Crown that the property in Paris\r\nshould be confiscated to the royal treasury, and as Schöffer & Henckis\r\nwere subjects of the Duke of Burgundy, whose relations with Louis XI.\r\nmight be called strained, the influence of the Court was decidedly in\r\nfavour of the appropriation of any business interest that they might\r\nhave in their partner’s property in Paris. In the contention between\r\nthe university and the Crown, the latter proved the stronger, and the\r\nbookseller’s 800 crowns were confiscated for the royal treasury, and at\r\nleast got so far towards the treasury as the hands of the chancellor.\r\n\r\nAs a further result of the issue which had been raised, it was ordered\r\non the part of the Crown that thereafter no foreigner should have a\r\npost as an official of the university or should be in a position to lay\r\nclaim to the exemption and the privileges attaching to such post.\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris the manuscript-dealers had been promptly driven from\r\nthe field through the competition of the printers, in Rouen they held\r\ntheir own for a considerable term of years. The space which had been\r\nassigned to the _librarii_ for their shops at the chief doorway of the\r\ncathedral, continued to be reserved for them as late as 1483, and the\r\nbooksellers keeping on sale the printed books, were forbidden to have\r\nany shops at this end of the cathedral, but were permitted to put up,\r\nat their own cost, stalls at the north doorway.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Paris bookseller whose name has been placed on record is\r\ndescribed as Herneis le Romanceur. He had his shop at the entrance\r\nto Notre Dame. His inscription appeared in a beautiful manuscript\r\npresenting a French translation of the Code of Justinian, a manuscript\r\ndating from the early part of the thirteenth century. It is possible\r\nthat Guillaume Herneis, whose name appeared in the tax list of 1292\r\nwith a rate of ten livres, was the scribe and the publisher of the\r\nabove manuscript, but if this were the case he must have been at the\r\ntime of this tax rating well advanced in years.[367] In 1274, the name\r\nof Hugichio le Lombard appears recorded on several manuscripts which\r\nhave been preserved in existing collections. In the taxes of 1292,\r\nappears the name of Agnien, _Libraire_, in the Rue de la Boucherie,\r\nassessed for thirty-six sous. The tax is too large to make it probable\r\nthat Agnien was a mere pedlar or did business from an open stall, and\r\nit is Géraud’s opinion that he was charged probably as a university\r\nbookseller to whom the tax collector had refused the exemption\r\nbelonging to university members.[368]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1303, the stock of books of a certain Antoine Zeno,\r\n_libraire juré_, was scheduled for taxation. Among the titles included\r\nin this schedule are the commentaries or lectures of Bruno on S.\r\nMatthew (57 pages, price one sol), the same on Mark, Luke, and John,\r\nthe commentaries of Alexander on Matthew, the _Opera Fratris Richardi_,\r\nthe _Legenda Sanctorum_, various texts of the Decretals, commentaries\r\nof S. Bernard on the Decretals, a treatise of a certain Thomas on\r\nmetaphysics, on physics, on the heavens and the earth, and on the soul,\r\nand a series of lectures on ethics, and on politics. The scheduled\r\nprice ranged from one sol to eight sols, the latter being the price of\r\na manuscript of 136 pages. The books were probably confined exclusively\r\nto texts used in the university work.[369]\r\n\r\nIn 1313, appears in the tax list, assessed for twelve sous, the name of\r\nNicholas L’Anglois, bookseller and tavern-keeper in Rue St. Jacques.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the booksellers, and for that matter the traders\r\ngenerally of the time, are frequently distinguished by the names of\r\ntheir native countries. It is probable that Nicholas failed to escape\r\ntaxation as a bookseller because he was also carrying on business (and\r\ndoubtless a more profitable business) in his tavern. The list of 1313\r\nincludes in fact but three booksellers, and each of these is described\r\nas having an additional trade.[370]\r\n\r\nA document of the year 1332 describes a sale made by a certain Geoffroy\r\nde Saint Léger, a _clerc libraire_, to Gérard de Montagu, _avocat\r\ndu roy au parlement_. Geoffroy acknowledges to have sold, ceded,\r\nassigned, and delivered to the said Gérard a book entitled _Speculum\r\nHistoriale in Consuetudines Parisienses_, comprised in four volumes,\r\nand bound in red leather. He guarantees the validity of this sale with\r\nhis own body, _de son corps mesme_. Gérard pays for the book the sum\r\nof forty Parisian livres, with which sum Geoffroy declares himself\r\nto be content, and paid in full.[371] It appears that the sale of a\r\nbook in the fourteenth century was a solemn transaction, calling for\r\ndocumentary evidence as specific as in the case of the transfer of real\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1376, Jean de Beauvais, a _librarius juratus_, is recorded\r\nas having sold various works, including the Decretals of Gregory\r\nIX., illustrated with miniatures, a copy of _Summa Hostiensis_, 423\r\nparchment leaves, illustrated with miniatures, and a codex of Magister\r\nThomas de Maalaa.[372]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1337, Guidomarus de Senis, master of arts and _librarius\r\njuratus_, renews his oath as a taxator. He seems to have put into his\r\nbusiness as bookseller a certain amount of literary gaiety, if one may\r\njudge from the lines added at the end of a parchment codex sold by him,\r\nwhich codex contains the poems of Guillaume de Marchaut.\r\n\r\nThe lines are as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Explicit au mois d’avril,\r\n  Qui est gai, cointe et gentil,\r\n  L’an mil trois cent soixante et onze.\r\n  D’Avril la semaine seconde,\r\n  Acheva à un vendredi,\r\n  Guiot de Sens c’est livre si,\r\n  Et le comansa de sa main,\r\n  Et ne fina ne soir ne matin,\r\n  Tant qu’il eut l’euvre accomplie,\r\n  Louée soit la vierge Marie._[373]\r\n\r\nPhilip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, was one of the more important book\r\ncollectors of his time. In 1386, the Duke paid to Martin L’Huillier,\r\ndealer in manuscripts and bookbinder, sixteen francs for binding\r\neight books, six of which were bound in grain leather.[374] The Duke\r\nof Orleans also appears as a buyer of books, and in 1394, he paid to\r\nJehan de Marsan, master of arts and dealer in manuscripts, twenty\r\nfrancs in gold for the _Letters of S. Pol_, bound in figured silk, and\r\nilluminated with the arms of the Duke.\r\n\r\nFour years later, the Duke makes another purchase, paying to Jehan one\r\nhundred _livres tournois_ for a Concordance to the Bible in Latin, an\r\nilluminated manuscript bound in red leather, stamped.\r\n\r\nThe same Duke, in 1394, paid forty gold crowns to Olivier, one of the\r\nfour principal _librarii_, for a Latin text of the Bible, bound in\r\nred leather, and in 1396, this persistent ducal collector pays sixty\r\nlivres to a certain Jacques Jehan, who is recorded as a grocer, but who\r\napparently included books in his stock, for the _Book of the Treasury_,\r\na book of Julius Cæsar, a book of the King, _The Secret of Secrets_,\r\nand a book of Estrille Fauveau, bound in one volume, illuminated, and\r\nbearing the arms of the Duke of Lancaster. Another volume included\r\nin this purchase was the _Romance of the Rose_, and the _Livres des\r\nEschez_, “moralised,” and bound together in one volume, illuminated in\r\ngold and azure.[375]\r\n\r\nIn 1399, appears on the records the name of Dyne, or Digne Rapond,\r\na Lombard. Kirchhoff speaks of Rapond’s book business as being with\r\nhim a side issue. Like Atticus, the publisher of Cicero, Rapond’s\r\nprincipal business interest was that of banking, in which the Lombards\r\nwere at that time pre-eminent throughout Europe. In connection with\r\nhis banking, however, he accepted orders from noble clients and\r\nparticularly from the Duke of Burgundy, for all classes of articles of\r\nluxury, among which were included books.\r\n\r\nIn 1399, Rapond delivered to Philip of Burgundy, for the price of five\r\nhundred livres, a _Livy_ illuminated with letters of gold and with\r\nimages, and for six thousand francs a work entitled _La Propriété de\r\nChoses_. A document, bearing date 1397, states that Charles, King of\r\nFrance, is bound to Dyne Rapond, merchant of Paris, for the sum of 190\r\nfrancs of gold, for certain pieces of tapestry, for certain shirts,\r\nand for four great volumes containing the chronicles of France. He is\r\nfurther bound in the sum of ninety-two francs for some more shirts,\r\nfor a manuscript of Seneca, for the Chronicles of Charlemagne, for\r\nthe Chronicles of Pepin, for the Chronicles of Godefroy de Bouillon,\r\nthe latter for his dear elder son Charles, Dauphin. The King further\r\npurchases certain hats, handkerchiefs, and some more books, for which\r\nhe instructs his treasurer in Paris to pay over to said Rapond the\r\nsum of ninety francs in full settlement of his account; the document\r\nis signed on behalf of the King by his secretary at his château of\r\nVincennes.[376]\r\n\r\nJacques Rapond, merchant and citizen of Paris, probably a brother of\r\nDyne, also seems to have done a profitable business with Philip of\r\nBurgundy, as he received from Philip, for a Bible in French, 9000\r\nfrancs, and in the same year (1400), for a copy of _The Golden Legend_,\r\n7500 francs.\r\n\r\nNicholas Flamel, scribe and _librarius juratus_, flourished at the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century. He was shrewd enough, having made\r\nsome little money at work as a bookseller and as a school manager, to\r\ncarry on some successful speculations in house building, from which\r\nspeculations he made money so rapidly that he was accused of dealings\r\nwith the Evil One. One of the houses built by him in Rue Montmorency\r\nwas still standing in 1853, an evidence of what a clever publisher\r\nmight accomplish even in the infancy of the book business.\r\n\r\nThe list of booksellers between the years 1486-1490 includes the name\r\nof Jean Bonhomme, the name which has for many years been accepted\r\nas typical of the French bourgeois. This particular Bonhomme seems,\r\nhowever, to have been rather a distinctive man of his class. He calls\r\nhimself “bookseller to the university,” and was a dealer both in\r\nmanuscripts and in printed books. On a codex of a French translation\r\nof _The City of God_, by S. Augustine, is inscribed the record\r\nof the sale of the manuscript by Jean Bonhomme, bookseller to the\r\nUniversity of Paris, who acknowledges having sold to the honoured\r\nand wise citizen, Jehan Cueillette, treasurer of M. de Beaujeu, this\r\nbook containing _The City of God_, in two volumes, and Bonhomme\r\nguarantees to Cueillette the possession of said work against all. His\r\nimprint as a bookseller appears upon various printed books, including\r\nthe _Constitutiones Clementinæ_, the _Decreta Basiliensia_, and the\r\n_Manuale Confessorum_ of Joh. Nider.\r\n\r\nAmong the cities of France outside of Paris in which there is record\r\nof early manuscript-dealers, are Tours, Angers, Lille, Troyes, Rouen,\r\nToulouse, and Montpellier. In Lille, in 1435, the principal bookseller\r\nwas Jaquemart Puls, who was also a goldsmith, the latter being probably\r\nhis principal business. In Toulouse, a bookseller of the name of\r\nS. Julien was in business as early as 1340. In Troyes, in the year\r\n1500, Macé Panthoul was carrying on business as a bookseller and as a\r\nmanufacturer of paper. In connection with his paper-trade, he came into\r\nrelations with the book-dealers of Paris.\r\n\r\n=Manuscript Dealers in Germany.=--The information concerning the\r\nearly book-dealers in Germany is more scanty, and on the whole\r\nless interesting, than that which is available for the history of\r\nbookselling in Italy or in France. There was less wealth among the\r\nGerman nobles during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and fewer\r\namong the nobles who had means were interested in literary luxuries\r\nthan was the case in either France, Burgundy, or Italy.\r\n\r\nAs has been noted in the preceding division of this chapter, the\r\nreferences to the more noteworthy of the manuscript-dealers in France\r\noccur almost entirely in connection with sales made by them to the\r\nmembers of the Royal Family, to the Dukes of Burgundy, or to other of\r\nthe great nobles. The beautifully illuminated manuscript which carried\r\nthe coat-of-arms or the crest of the noble for whom it was made,\r\nincluded also, as a rule, the inscription of the manuscript-dealer by\r\nwhom the work of its preparation had been carried on or supervised,\r\nand through whom it had been sold to the noble purchaser. Of the\r\nmanuscripts of this class, the record in Germany is very much smaller.\r\nGermany also did not share the advantages possessed by Italy, of close\r\nrelations with the literature and the manuscript stores of the East,\r\nrelations which proved such an important and continued source of\r\ninspiration for the intellectual life of the Italian scholars.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the revival of the knowledge of Greek literature\r\ncame to Germany slowly through its relations with Italy, but in the\r\nknowledge of Greek learning and literature the German scholars were\r\nmany years behind their Italian contemporaries, while the possession of\r\nGreek manuscripts in Germany was, before the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, very exceptional indeed. The scholarship of the earlier German\r\nuniversities appears also to have been narrower in its range and more\r\nrestricted in its cultivation than that which had been developed in\r\nParis, in Bologna, or in Padua. The membership of the Universities of\r\nPrague and of Vienna, the two oldest in the German list, was evidently\r\nrestricted almost entirely to Germans, Bohemians, Hungarians, etc.,\r\nthat is to say, to the races immediately controlled by the German\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIf a scholar of England were seeking, during the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, special instruction or special literary and\r\nscholarly advantages, his steps were naturally directed towards Paris\r\nfor theology, Bologna for jurisprudence, and Padua for medicine, and\r\nbut few of these travelling English scholars appear to have taken\r\nthemselves to Prague, Vienna, or Heidelberg.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if English book collectors were seeking manuscripts,\r\nthey betook themselves to the dealers in Paris, in Florence, or in\r\nVenice, and it was not until after the manuscript-trade had been\r\nreplaced by the trade in the productions of the printing-press that the\r\nGerman cities can be said to have become centres for the distribution\r\nof literature.\r\n\r\nSuch literary interests as obtained in Germany during the fourteenth\r\ncentury, outside of those of the monasteries already referred to,\r\ncentred nevertheless about the universities. The oldest of these\r\nuniversities was that of Prague, which was founded in 1347, more\r\nthan a century later than the foundations of Paris and Bologna. The\r\nregulations of the University recognised the existence of scribes,\r\nilluminators, correctors, binders, dealers in parchment, etc., all of\r\nwhich trades were placed under the direct control of the university\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nHauslik speaks of the book-trade in the fourteenth century as being\r\nassociated with the work of the library of the university, and refers\r\nto licensed scribes and illuminators, who were authorised to make\r\ntranscripts, for the use of the members of the university, of the texts\r\ncontained in the library.[377]\r\n\r\nIf we may understand from this reference that the university\r\nauthorities had had prepared for the library authenticated copies of\r\nthe texts of the works required in the university courses, and that the\r\ntranscribing of these texts was carried on under the direct supervision\r\nof the librarians, Prague appears to have possessed a better system for\r\nthe preparation of its official texts than we have record of in either\r\nBologna or Paris. Hauslik goes on to say that the entire book-trade of\r\nthe city was placed under the supervision of the library authorities,\r\nwhich authorities undertook to guarantee the completeness and the\r\ncorrectness of all transcripts made from the texts in the library.\r\nKirchhoff presents in support of this theory examples of one or two\r\nmanuscripts, which contain, in addition to the inscription of the name\r\nof the scribe or dealer by whom it had been prepared, the record of the\r\ncorrector appointed by the library to certify to the correctness of the\r\ntext.[378]\r\n\r\nThe second German university in point of date was that of Vienna,\r\nfounded in 1365, and, in connection with the work of this university\r\nthe manuscript-trade in Germany took its most important development.\r\nThere is record in Vienna of the existence of _stationarii_ who carried\r\non, under the usual university supervision, the trade of hiring out\r\n_pecias_, but this was evidently a much less important function than in\r\nBologna.\r\n\r\nThe buying and selling of books in Vienna was kept under very close\r\nuniversity supervision, and without the authority of the rector or of\r\nthe bedels appointed by him for the purpose, no book could be purchased\r\nfrom either a _magister_ or a student, or could be accepted on pledge.\r\n\r\nThe books which had been left by deceased members of the university\r\nwere considered to be the property of the university authorities, and\r\ncould be sold only under their express directions. The commission\r\nallowed by the authorities for the sale of books was limited to 2½ per\r\ncent., and before any books could be transferred at private sale, they\r\nmust be offered at public sale in the auditorium. The purpose of this\r\nregulation was apparently here as in Paris not only to insure securing\r\nfor the books sold the highest market prices, but also to give some\r\nprotection against the possibility of books being sold by those to whom\r\nthey did not belong.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the details of the book business appears to have\r\nfallen gradually into the hands of the bedels of the Faculty, and\r\nthe details of the supervision exercised approach more nearly to the\r\nItalian than to the Parisian model.\r\n\r\nThe third German university was that of Heidelberg, founded in 1386.\r\nHere the regulations concerning the book-trade were substantially\r\nmodelled upon those of Paris. The scribes and the dealers in\r\nmanuscripts belonged to the privileged members of the university.\r\nThe provisions in the foundation or charter of the university, which\r\nprovided for the manuscript-trade, make express reference to the\r\nprecedents of the University of Paris.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the fifteenth century, there appears to have been a\r\nconsiderable trade in manuscripts in Heidelberg and in places dependent\r\nupon Heidelberg. In the library of the University of Erlangen, there\r\nexists to-day a considerable collection of manuscripts formerly\r\nbelonging to the monastery of Heilsbronn, which manuscripts were\r\nprepared in Heidelberg between 1450 and 1460. The series includes\r\na long list of classics, indicating a larger classical interest in\r\nHeidelberg than was to be noted at the time in either Prague or\r\nVienna.[379]\r\n\r\nThe University of Cologne, founded a few years later, became the centre\r\nof theological scholarship in Germany, and the German manuscripts\r\nof the early part of the fifteenth century which have remained in\r\nexistence and which have to do with theological subjects were very\r\nlargely produced in Cologne. A number of examples of these have been\r\npreserved in the library of Erfurt.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the smaller importance in Germany of the _stationarius_\r\nwas the practice that obtained on the part of the instructors of\r\nlecturing or of reading from texts for dictation, the transcripts being\r\nmade by the students themselves. The authority or permission to read\r\nfor dictation was made a matter of special university regulation. The\r\nregulation provided what works could be so utilised, and the guarantee\r\nas to the correctness of the texts to be used could either be given\r\nby a member of the faculty of the university itself or was accepted\r\nwith the certified signature of an instructor of a well known foreign\r\nuniversity, such as Paris, Bologna, or Oxford.\r\n\r\nBy means of this system of dictation, the production of manuscripts\r\nwas made much less costly than through the work of the _stationarii_,\r\nand the dictation system was probably an important reason why the\r\nmanuscript-trade in the German university cities never became so\r\nimportant as in Paris or London.\r\n\r\nIt is contended by the German writers that, notwithstanding the\r\ninconsiderable trade in manuscripts, there was a general knowledge of\r\nthe subject-matter of the literature pursued in the university, no\r\nless well founded or extended among the German cities than among those\r\nof France or Italy. This familiarity with the university literature\r\nis explained by the fact that the students had, through writing at\r\ndictation, so largely possessed themselves of the substance of the\r\nuniversity lectures.\r\n\r\nIn the Faculty of Arts at Ingolstadt, it was ordered, in 1420, that\r\nthere should be not less than one text-book (that is to say, one copy\r\nof the text-book) for every three scholars in baccalaureate. This\r\nregulation is an indication of the scarcity of text-books.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the industry in loaning manuscripts to students was\r\nnot well developed in the German universities delayed somewhat the\r\norganisation of the book-trade in the university towns. Nevertheless,\r\nRichard de Bury names Germany among the countries where books could be\r\npurchased, and Gerhard Groote speaks of purchasing books in Frankfort.\r\nThis city became, in fact, important in the trade of manuscripts for\r\nnearly a century before the beginning of German printing.[380]\r\n\r\nÆneas Silvius says in the preface of his _Europa_, written in 1458,\r\nthat a _librarius teutonicus_ had written to him shortly before, asking\r\nhim to prepare a continuation of the book “_Augustalis_.”[381] This\r\npublishing suggestion was made eight years after the perfection of\r\nGutenberg’s printing-press, but probably without any knowledge on the\r\npart of the _librarius_ of the new method for the production of books.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there was, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\r\noutside of the ecclesiastics, very little demand for reading matter.\r\nThe women had their psalters, which had, as a rule, been written out\r\nin the monasteries. As there came to be a wider demand for books\r\nof worship, this was provided for, at least in the regions of the\r\nlower Rhine, by the scribes among the Brothers of Common Life. The\r\nBrothers took care also of the production of a large proportion of the\r\nschool-books required.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century and the first half of the fifteenth,\r\nthe Brothers took an active part in the production and distribution\r\nof manuscripts. Their work was distinct in various respects from\r\nthat which was carried on in monastery or in university towns, but\r\nparticularly in this that their books were, for the most part, produced\r\nin the tongue of the common folk, and their service as instructors\r\nand booksellers was probably one of the most important influences in\r\nhelping to educate the lower classes of North Germany to read and to\r\nthink for themselves. They thus prepared the way for the work of Luther\r\nand Melanchthon.\r\n\r\nAs has been noted in another chapter, the activity of the Brothers in\r\nthe distribution of literature did not cease when books in manuscripts\r\nwere replaced by the productions of the printing-press. They made\r\nimmediate use of the invention of Gutenberg, and in many parts of\r\nGermany, the first printed books that were brought before the people\r\ncame from the printing-presses of the Brothers.\r\n\r\nSome general system of public schools seems to have taken shape in\r\nthe larger cities at least of North Germany as early as the first half\r\nof the thirteenth century. The teachers in these schools themselves\r\nadded to their work and to their earnings by transcribing text-books\r\nand sometimes works of worship. Later, there came to be some extended\r\ninterest in certain classes of literature among a few of the princes\r\nand noblemen, but this appears to have been much less the case in\r\nGermany than in Italy or even than in France. In the castles or palaces\r\nwhere there was a chaplain, the chaplain took upon himself the work of\r\na scribe, caring not only for the correspondence of his patron, but\r\noccasionally also preparing manuscripts for the library, so called, of\r\nthe castle. There is also record of certain _stadtschreiber_, or public\r\nscribes, licensed as such in the cities of North Germany, and in some\r\ncases the post was held by the instructors of the schools.\r\n\r\nUlrich Friese, a citizen of Augsburg, writing in the latter half of\r\nthe fourteenth century, speaks of attending the Nordlingen Fair with\r\nparchment and books. Nordlingen Church was, it appears, used for the\r\npurpose of this fair, and in Lübeck, in the Church of S. Mary, booths\r\nwere opened in which, together with devotional books, school-books and\r\nwriting materials were offered for sale.\r\n\r\nIn Hamburg also, the courts in the immediate neighbourhood of the\r\nchurches were the places selected by the earlier booksellers and\r\nmanuscript-dealers for their trade. In Metz, a book-shop stood\r\nimmediately in front of the cathedral, and in Vienna, the first\r\nbook-shop was placed in the court adjoining the cathedral of S.\r\nStephen. Nicolaus, who was possibly the earliest bookseller in Erfurt,\r\nhad his shop, in 1460, in the court of the Church of the Blessed Virgin.\r\n\r\nFrom a school regulation of Bautzen, written in 1418, it appears\r\nthat the children were instructed to purchase their school-books\r\nfrom the master at the prices fixed in the official schedule.[382]\r\nA certain schoolmaster in Hagenau, whose work was carried on between\r\n1443 and 1450, has placed his signature upon a considerable series of\r\nmanuscripts, which he claims to have prepared with his own hands, and\r\nwhich were described in Wilken’s History of the library in Heidelberg.\r\nHis name was Diebold Läber, or, as he sometimes wrote it, Lauber,\r\nand he describes himself as a writer, _schreiber_, in the town of\r\nHagenau. This inscription appears in so many manuscripts that have been\r\npreserved, that some doubt has been raised as to whether they could\r\nbe all the work of one hand, or whether Lauber’s name (imprint, so to\r\nspeak) may not have been utilised by other scribes possibly working in\r\nassociation with him.[383]\r\n\r\nLauber speaks of having received from Duke Ruprecht an order for\r\nseven books, and as having arranged to have the manuscripts painted\r\n(decorated or illuminated) by some other hand. Lauber is recorded as\r\nhaving been first a school-teacher and an instructor in writing, later\r\na scribe, producing for sale copies of standard texts, and finally a\r\npublisher, employing scribes, simply certifying with his own signature\r\nto the correctness of the work of his subordinates. There is every\r\nindication that he had actually succeeded in organising in Hagenau, as\r\nearly as 1443, an active business in the production and distribution of\r\nmanuscripts. The books produced by him were addressed more generally\r\nto the popular taste than was the case with the productions of the\r\nmonastery scribes.\r\n\r\nIn part, possibly, as a result of this early activity in the production\r\nof books, one of the first printing-presses in Germany, outside of\r\nthat of Gutenberg in Mayence, was instituted in Hagenau, and its work\r\nappears to have been in direct succession to that of the public writer\r\nLauber.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Hagenau and Heidelberg were intimate, and the\r\nscholarly service of the members of the university was utilised by the\r\nHagenau publishers. The book-trade of Hagenau also appears to have been\r\nincreased in connection with the development of intellectual activity\r\ngiven by the Councils of Constance and Basel. In regard to the latter\r\nCouncil, Kirchhoff quotes Denis as having said:\r\n\r\n_Quod concilium, qui scholam librariorum dixerit haud errabit._[384]\r\n\r\nEither as a cause or as an effect of the activity of the book\r\nproduction in Hagenau, the Hagenau schools for scribes during the\r\nfirst half of the fifteenth century became famous.[385] The work of\r\nproducing manuscripts appears to have been divided, according to the\r\nmanufacturing system; one scribe prepared the text, a second collated\r\nthe same with the original, a third painted in the rubricated initials,\r\nand a fourth designed the painted head-pieces to the pages, while\r\na fifth prepared the ornamented covers. It occasionally happened,\r\nhowever, that one scribe was himself able to carry on each division of\r\nthe work of the production of an illuminated manuscript.\r\n\r\nHagen quotes some lines of a Hagenau manuscript, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Dis buch vollenbracht vas,\r\n  In der zit, also man schreip vnd las,\r\n  Tusent vnd vyer hundert jar.\r\n  Nach Christus gebort daz ist war,\r\n  Dar nach jn dem eyn vnd siebentzigsten jar,\r\n  Vff sant Pauly bekarung, daz ist ware,\r\n  Von Hans Dirmsteyn, wist vor war,\r\n  Der hait es geschreben vnd gemacht,\r\n  Gemalt, gebunden, vnd gantz follenbracht._[386]\r\n\r\nHagenau was one of the few places of book production (excepting\r\nthe workshops of the Brothers of Common Life) in which, during the\r\nmanuscript period, books were prepared to meet the requirements of the\r\ncommon folk. The literature proceeding from Hagenau included not only\r\n“good Latin books,” that is to say, copies of the accepted classics as\r\nused in Heidelberg and elsewhere, but also copies of the famous Epics\r\nof the Middle Ages, the Sagas, Folk Songs, Chap-Books, copies of the\r\nGolden Bull, Bible stories, books of worship, books of popular music,\r\nbooks of prophecy, and books for the telling of fortunes, etc.[387]\r\n\r\nThroughout both Germany and the Low Countries, it was the case that,\r\nduring the manuscript period, the work of the school teachers was\r\nclosely connected with the work of the producers and sellers of\r\nmanuscripts, and the teachers not infrequently themselves built up\r\na manuscript business. The school ordinance of the town of Bautzen,\r\ndating from the year 1418, prescribed, for example, the prices which\r\nthe scholars were to pay to the _locatus_ (who was the fifth teacher in\r\nrank in the institution) for the school-books, the responsibility for\r\npreparing which rested upon him.\r\n\r\nA history of the Printers’ Society of Dresden, printed in 1740, gives\r\nexamples of some of these prices:\r\n\r\n  For one _A. B. C._ and a paternoster, each one groschen.\r\n  For a _Corde Benedicite_, one groschen.\r\n  For a good _Donat_, ten groschens.\r\n  For a _Regulam Moralem et Catonem_, eight groschens.\r\n  For a complete _Doctrinal_, a half mark.\r\n  For a _Primam Partem_, eight groschens.\r\n\r\nIn case no books are purchased from the _locatus_, there shall be paid\r\nto him by each scholar, if the scholar be rich, two groschens, if he be\r\nin moderate circumstances, one groschen, and if the scholar be poor, he\r\nshall be exempt from payment.[388]\r\n\r\nA certain Hugo from Trimberg, who died about 1309, is referred to by\r\nJaeck as having been a teacher for forty years, at the end of which\r\nterm he gave up the work of teaching with the expectation of being\r\nable to make a living out of his collection of books. The collection\r\ncomprised two hundred volumes, of which twelve are specified as being\r\noriginal works, presumably the production of Trimberg himself. Jaeck\r\ndoes not tell us whether or not the good schoolmaster was able to earn\r\nenough from the manifolding or from the sale of his books to secure a\r\nliving in his last years.[389]\r\n\r\nKirchhoff refers to the importance of the fairs and annual markets\r\nfor the manuscript trade. It is evident that, in the absence of any\r\nbookselling machinery, it was of first importance for the producers\r\nof copies of such texts as might be within their reach, to come into\r\nrelations with each other in order to bring about the exchange of their\r\nsurplus copies.\r\n\r\nThere is record of the sale and exchange of manuscripts, during the\r\nfirst half of the fifteenth century, at the Fairs of Salzburg, Ulm,\r\nNordlingen, and Frankfort. It was in fact from its trade in manuscripts\r\nthat Frankfort, by natural development, became and for many years\r\nremained the centre of the trade in printed books.[390] Ruland speaks\r\nof one of the most important items of the manuscript-trade at the\r\nFrankfort Fair between 1445 and 1450, being that of fortune-telling\r\nbooks and illustrated chap-books.\r\n\r\nIt appears also from the Fair records that in Germany, as in Italy,\r\nthe dealers in parchment and paper were among the first to associate\r\nwith their goods the sale of manuscripts. In 1470, occurs the earliest\r\nrecord of sales being made at the fair in Nordlingen of printed\r\nbooks.[391] The earliest date at which the sale of printed books at\r\nthe fair at Frankfort was chronicled was 1480. In 1485, the printer\r\nPeter Schöffer was admitted as a citizen in Frankfort.\r\n\r\nWhile Kirchhoff maintains that the distribution of books in manuscript\r\nwas more extensive in Germany than in either France or Italy, and\r\nemphasises particularly the fact that there was among circles\r\nthroughout Germany a keener interest in literature than obtained\r\nwith either the French or the Italians, he admits that the record of\r\nnoteworthy booksellers in Germany, during the manuscript period, is,\r\nas compared with that of France and Italy, inconsiderable. In Cologne,\r\nhe finds, as early as 1389, through an inscription in a manuscript\r\nthat has been preserved, the name of Horstan de Ledderdam, who called\r\nhimself not a _librarius_, but a _libemarius_. The manuscript that\r\nbears this record is a treatise by Porphyry on Aristotle.\r\n\r\nIn Nordlingen, the tax list of 1407 gives the name of Joh. Minner,\r\nrecorded as a _scriptor_. There is an entry of a sale made by Minner to\r\nthe Burgermeister Protzen of a German translation of the _Decretals_.\r\nThe tax list of 1415 gives the name of Conrad Horn, described as a\r\n_stadtschreiber_. Horn seems to have carried on an extensive business\r\nin the production and the exchange of manuscripts. Kirchhoff quotes a\r\ncontract entered into by him in 1427 with a certain Prochsil of Eystet\r\nfor the purchase of a _buch_, the title of which is not given, for the\r\nsum of forty-three Rhenish gulden.\r\n\r\nThe name of Diebold Lauber has already been mentioned. His inscription\r\nappears on a number of manuscripts that have been preserved principally\r\nthrough the Heidelberg University. On the first sheet of a _Legend\r\nof the Three Holy Kings_ from this library, is written the following\r\nnotice, which can be considered as a general advertisement:\r\n\r\n    _Item welche hande bücher man gerne hat, gross oder clein,\r\n    geistlich oder weltlich, hübsch gemolt, die findet man alle by\r\n    Diepold Lauber, schreiber in der burge zu hagenow._\r\n\r\nFreely translated, this notice would read: “Any books that are desired,\r\nwhether great or small, religious or profane, beautifully painted\r\n(adorned), all of these will one find by Diepold Lauber, scribe in\r\nthe town of Hagenau.” Among the manuscripts of Lauber, which have\r\nbeen preserved, is a beautiful copy of _Gesta Romanorum, mit den\r\nviguren gemolt_, a Bible in rhyme (_eine gerymete bibel, ein salter\r\nLatin und Tüstch_). Also a number of _gemolte losbücher_ (illustrated\r\nfortune-telling books), etc.\r\n\r\nIn Heidelberg, the name of Wolff von Prunow, _bibliopola_, is recorded\r\nearly in the fifteenth century, as associated with the university. In\r\nBruges, in 1425, the list of manuscript-dealers is a more important\r\none. It begins with Joorquin de Vüc, who is described as a cleric. He\r\nwas bookseller to Duke Philip, and is spoken of by Labord as having\r\nhad an extensive manuscript factory.[392] Colart Mansion has already\r\nbeen referred to. He is recorded in 1450 as an _escripvain_, but a\r\nfew years later appears in the list of printers and is known as the\r\nfriend and associate of Caxton. The books of Duke Philip of Burgundy\r\ninclude also the name of the bookseller Hocberque, in 1427, and that of\r\nNeste in 1423. In 1456, Morisses de Haat is recorded as an _escripvain\r\nde livres_, who rented out books. In order to do this, he must, as\r\nKirchhoff points out, have carried some general stock. A certain Herr\r\nvan Gruthuyse, a rich collector, of Bruges, bought a number of finely\r\nilluminated manuscripts from Jean Paradis, who was in 1470 made a\r\nmember of the _librariers gild_.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff quotes a document dated 1346, the wording of which is in the\r\nform of a contract between Wouters Vos and Jan Standard, described\r\nas manuscript-dealers, “parties of the first part,” and a group of\r\ncitizens, “parties of the second part.” The contract has to do with\r\nthe transfer of certain books as security for a loan. The list of the\r\nbooks includes copies of the Codex of Justinian, some essays on taxes,\r\npolities, and rhetoric, a work by Albertus, a treatise by Ægidius, the\r\nPhysics of Aristotle, a commentary of Averrhoes, etc. These two dealers\r\nof Bruges seem to have had an important collection of literature for so\r\nearly a period.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript-trade in the Netherlands was more important both in\r\ncharacter and in extent than that carried on in Germany, and it had\r\nalso a larger influence upon the general education of the people than\r\nthe book-trade of the time in either France or Italy. In France and\r\nin Italy, the earlier book-trade was, as we have noted, connected\r\nprincipally with the work of the universities. In the Low Countries,\r\non the other hand, particularly in such centres as Ghent, Antwerp,\r\nand Bruges, there came into existence, during the first half of the\r\nfifteenth century, an active and intelligently conducted business in\r\nthe production of books both of a scholarly and of a popular character,\r\nthe sale of which was made very largely among the citizens, outside\r\nof the university circles. One reason why the trade in books found a\r\nlarger development in Belgium than in Germany, was the greater wealth\r\nof the trading class in the Low Countries. With the wealth, came\r\ncultivation and a taste for luxuries, and among luxuries soon came to\r\nbe included art and literature.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1424, there was instituted a guild of publishers,\r\n_librariers gild_, in Ghent, and a year or two later one in Brussels.\r\nThese guilds came into relations in 1450 with the St. Lucas Guild in\r\nAntwerp.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kapp, the first evidences of an organised German trade\r\nin manuscripts are to be found at the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. He is, however, convinced that a very considerable exchange\r\nof literary material in manuscripts must have found place at a much\r\nearlier date. There came to be in the German towns and among the\r\ncitizen class an earlier interest in literature than there is evidence\r\nof at this time in the same class of any other country of Europe. This\r\ndemand for reading matter on the part of the citizen class brought into\r\nexistence in Germany (at a time when in Italy, France, and England\r\nthere were practically no books in other than the Latin language) a\r\nconsiderable mass of popular literature written in the vernacular,\r\nand copied out on cheap material in such way as to make possible a\r\ngeneral circulation. This popular circulation of books written for the\r\ncommon folk was very much facilitated by the introduction into Germany,\r\nas early as the fourteenth century, of paper, which for the cheaper\r\nmanuscripts took the place of the old-time parchment.\r\n\r\nThe Order of Brothers of Common Life carried on their literary work,\r\nso to speak, between the monasteries and the writers of the general\r\nlay community. They had for their first purpose the dissemination of\r\nsound doctrine, but as they were trying to give instruction direct\r\nto the common folk, they put their teachings into the dialect of the\r\nplace, and they wrote out in their own monasteries the chap-books and\r\ninstruction books which, at times distributed freely from the monastery\r\ncentres, came to be very largely sold.\r\n\r\nTheir work lay between that of the monastery monks and that of the\r\ncity scribes in another respect. As before indicated, the work of\r\nthe scribes in the _scriptorium_ was performed for no individual\r\nremuneration. If the manuscripts were sold or were exchanged for\r\nproperty of one kind or another, the benefit of the sale or exchange\r\naccrued to the monastery. On the other hand, the scribes of the cities,\r\nas they came to organise themselves into an accepted trade, arrived at\r\na system of fixed charges for their work. The Brothers of Common Life,\r\nwhile living together in monkish centres, did not withdraw themselves\r\nfrom the life of the world, but made it their first duty, using their\r\nmonastery homes simply as a starting-place or place of consultation\r\nor as centres of education, to go out into the highways and by-ways,\r\nteaching what they had to teach direct to the people whom they met; and\r\nas an important means of this instruction they used their facilities\r\nas scribes for manifolding the tracts and the scriptural classics\r\nwith which they provided themselves. It was their recognition of the\r\nenormous service that could be secured in influencing a community\r\nthrough the distribution of books, that made them so prompt in their\r\nappreciation of the value of the printing-press and that caused them to\r\ntake place among the first printers of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe term commonly given to the earlier German scribes was _clericus_,\r\nor _pfaffe_, and nearly every well-to-do nobleman or citizen had a\r\n_clericus_, or _pfaffe_, to take charge of his correspondence and his\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nWhile the general use of this term indicates the ecclesiastical origin\r\nof the scribes and confirms the previous records to the effect that\r\nthe first scribes undoubtedly were monks trained in the monasteries,\r\nit is of course by no means to be accepted as evidence that the art of\r\nwriting continued, at least after the fourteenth century, to be limited\r\nto ecclesiastics. As has before been indicated, the monastery schools\r\naccepted very many pupils who had no intention of entering the Church,\r\nbut who secured from their monkish teachers a knowledge of reading and\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1403, mention is made of a certain Heilmannus, formerly\r\na cleric of the diocese of Trier, licensed as a public scribe (_eyn\r\noffenbar schreiber_). At about the same time, Dr. Conrad Humery, of\r\nMayence, is referred to in the chronicles as _pfaffe_, _jurist_,\r\nand _chancellor_ of the city. Ulrich Zell, who later became the\r\nfirst printer in Cologne, was accustomed to add to the imprint of\r\nhis works the designation _clericus_ from Hanau in the diocese of\r\nMayence. Notwithstanding the term _clericus_ and the reference to his\r\ndiocese, Ulrich had never been an ecclesiastic.[393] The ecclesiastical\r\ndivisions, parishes or dioceses, were utilised in those times, as\r\npolitical divisions are to-day, as the territorial designations that\r\nwould be most readily understood.\r\n\r\nThe trade in books in manuscript was developed from two great sources.\r\nFor a certain special and restricted class of work, the trade came into\r\nexistence and continued, as we have seen, for some centuries, in the\r\nItalian universities, in the University of Paris, and in two or three\r\nof the older German universities. Some little time later, the scribes\r\nfound place among the hand-workers and dealers of the larger cities.\r\nTheir work was at first carried on most actively in connection with\r\ncathedrals and churches, and, later, associated itself with the annual\r\nmarkets and fairs.\r\n\r\nIn the trade centres, where the goldsmiths, designers, and illuminators\r\nfound profitable occupation, the skilled writers (that is to say, those\r\nwho were competent to prepare the elaborately ornamented manuscripts)\r\nsoon found occupation, while the writers of common text came to be\r\nemployed particularly, as mentioned, in the markets and fairs in\r\nconnection with the records and correspondence required for business\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the first half of the fifteenth century the production of\r\nmanuscripts, which, from the beauty of their script and the artistic\r\nfinish of their illustrations and ornamentations, could be classed as\r\nworks of art, became an important industry, an industry of which the\r\ncentres in Germany and the Low Countries were Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp,\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, Cologne, Strasburg, Augsburg, Ulm, and Vienna.\r\n\r\nAs before indicated, the manuscripts produced in the Netherlands and\r\nin Burgundy far surpassed those of Germany and, for that matter, those\r\nof the rest of the world, in beauty and in the elaboration of their\r\nartistic finish and ornamentation. The Dukes of Burgundy took a large\r\npersonal interest in this special industry of their dominions, and\r\ntheir patronage did much to make the art fashionable and to further its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the introduction of printing, the printers and book-makers\r\ninstituted their trade-unions or guilds in Ghent and in Bruges, they\r\nabsorbed into their organisations the existing associations of fine\r\nwriters, scribes, illuminators, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the library of S. Mark’s, in Venice, there is a beautiful breviary\r\nknown as that of Grimani, which was produced in 1478 by certain artists\r\nof Bruges, among whom is mentioned John Memmling, and which was\r\npurchased in 1489, for five hundred ducats, by the Cardinal Grimani.\r\nAbout the same time, that is to say, between 1468 and 1469, was\r\nproduced the copy of Froissart’s Chronicles which had been prepared in\r\nBruges for the son of Duke Philip of Burgundy, and which is at present\r\nin the possession of the library of the University of Breslau.\r\n\r\nThe labour of the scribes of the fifteenth century was, however, by no\r\nmeans exclusively devoted to works of magnificence (_prachtwerke_).\r\nFrom the shops of the ordinary writers, were produced considerable\r\nmasses of text-books, books of worship, cookery books, astrological\r\ntreatises, almanacs, and even political tracts. Before the middle\r\nof the century, there are records of licensed scribes carrying on\r\na general business for the public in Cologne, Frankfort, Augsburg,\r\nVienna, and even in smaller towns, such as Nordlingen.\r\n\r\nThe scribes of the universities, who were included among the\r\nuniversity officials, and who, in securing certain university\r\nprivileges, subjected themselves also to a rather elaborate series\r\nof restrictions, were naturally not in a position to leave their\r\nuniversity towns to do work in other centres. In fact, it was for\r\na long time not permitted for them to take up any work outside of\r\nproviding the copies required of the authorised university texts.\r\nThe scribes who were not associated with any official bodies were,\r\nhowever, free to carry their work from place to place according as the\r\nvarying demand of the seasons of the year, a demand dependent upon the\r\nmarkets, the fairs, and other special business conditions, might give\r\nopportunity for a profitable use of their labours. The shops of these\r\ntown scribes were, as a rule, in the open places, more particularly in\r\nthe market, in the neighbourhood of the town hall, or under the shadow\r\nof the cathedral or principal church. Frequently, where the business\r\nwas not quite important enough to warrant a shop, it was carried on\r\nunder the steps or in the porches of the church or the cathedral, and\r\nsometimes even within the church building, in one of the chapels.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the old-time ecclesiastical associations of\r\nthe art (which was still known as “clerical”) may have caused the\r\nauthorities having charge of the church buildings to look with special\r\nfavour upon these later scribes, so that they were able to secure for\r\ntheir trade facilities and accommodations which would not have been\r\nafforded to workers or dealers in other occupations.\r\n\r\nThere is a reference, in 1408, in one of the Strasburg chronicles to\r\na scribe named Peter von Haselo, who sells books on the steps of the\r\ncathedral of Our Lady.[394] In Cologne the manuscript-dealers took\r\npossession of various corners or angles of the cathedral for their\r\nshops or booths. In Münster the space immediately in front of the\r\ncathedral was allotted to them. In a number of the larger cities the\r\nscribes dealt not only in the productions of their own pens, but in\r\nsuch ancient manuscripts as they had been able to collect, these\r\ncoming for the most part from Italy. It was from this branch of their\r\nbusiness that the booksellers came to be known quite frequently as\r\n_antiquarii_.\r\n\r\nWhile there gradually grew up throughout Germany an active trade in\r\nmanuscripts, the record shows an earlier development of this trade in\r\nItaly and France, and even in England. Reference has already been made\r\nto the activity as a book collector of Richard de Bury, who in the\r\nfirst half of the fourteenth century secured through travelling dealers\r\nmanuscripts which had been brought from France and from Italy. De Bury\r\nspeaks of these dealers as taking commissions for the delivery of the\r\nmanuscripts at such interval of months as would be required for the\r\nlong journeys from Oxford to Paris and back, or from Oxford to Florence\r\nor Venice.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that towards the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhen the work of town scribes in Germany had once begun and the\r\ncharacter of their productions came to be known to the common people,\r\nthe circulation of books among the people was more extensive in amount\r\nand more wide-reaching in the territory and the classes of buyers\r\nconcerned than was the case in any other state of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1439, some dealers from the Siebengebirge brought from Basel to\r\nHermannstadt certain political controversies and tracts. Some of\r\nthe latter treated of the work of the Council of Basel, and came,\r\ntherefore, under the censorship of the Church, and their circulation in\r\nHermannstadt was forbidden.[395]\r\n\r\nBetween 1440 and 1450, the records of the annual fairs of Nordlingen\r\ninclude repeated references to dealings in manuscripts.\r\n\r\nAfter 1460, it is not always easy to determine whether the\r\nspecifications of the prices paid for books refer to manuscripts or\r\nto printed copies. On the 27th of March, 1485, Rudolph Agricola, the\r\nlibrarian of the Elector of the Palatinate, writes to his friend Adolph\r\nRusch, a bookseller from Strasburg who was at that time in Frankfort,\r\nordering for his library copies of the following books: Columella, _De\r\nRe Rustica_; Celsus, _De Medicina_; _Macrobii Saturnalia_, _Statii_,\r\n_Opera_, and Silius Italicus. It is certain, says Kirchhoff, that these\r\nbooks had not yet been printed in Germany, and he is, therefore, of\r\nopinion that Agricola was expecting to secure manuscripts. Kapp points\r\nout, however, that certain of them had already been printed in Italy;\r\n_Columella_, for instance, had been published in a volume with _Cato_\r\nand _Varro_, in Venice in 1472, and in Reggio in 1482.\r\n\r\n_Celsus_ appeared in Florence in 1478, and in Milan in 1481;\r\n_Macrobius_, in Venice in 1472 and 1483; _Statius_ in Rome in 1476,\r\nin Milan in 1483; _Silius_ in Rome, in 1471, in Milan in 1480, and in\r\nParma in 1481.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that, in connection with the correspondence between\r\nthe scholars of Italy and the instructors in the University of\r\nHeidelberg, news might very easily have come to the librarian of the\r\nElector of these important classical undertakings, and that he had\r\nnaturally desired to secure copies of the books for the Elector’s\r\nlibrary. As far as I can understand from the reference made by\r\nKapp, there is no record of the result of this order or inquiry,\r\nor of the prices at which Agricola secured or hoped to secure the\r\nbooks in question. It was undoubtedly the case that, as the work\r\nof the printers, both German and Italian, came to be known to the\r\nbook collectors, there was a steady decrease in the prices paid for\r\nmanuscripts, until the business of the manuscript-dealers came to be\r\nlimited to the sale as curiosities of old codices, and the work of the\r\nscribes in the reproduction of copies ceased altogether.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the prices paid during the Middle\r\nAges for more or less famous manuscripts. The difficulty with the\r\nprices of which we have record is that they vary so considerably for\r\ngoods of apparently about the same description, a variation doubtless\r\ndepending upon the special conditions of the sale, the wealth or\r\neagerness of the purchaser, etc. In 1054, for instance, a _Book of the\r\nMass_ was sold by the monk named Ulrich (the sale being made with the\r\nconsent of the Abbot) in exchange for a great vineyard covering the\r\nslope of a large hill, the exact dimensions of which are not given.\r\nIn 1057, a nun named Diemude, of the convent of Wessobrunn, exchanged\r\na Bible, which she had written with her own hand, for a farm on\r\nPeissenburg. Without, however, the exact description of any particular\r\nmanuscript, a description which should specify the nature of the work\r\nput into it, the illuminations, the designs, the covers, etc., it is,\r\nof course, very difficult to compare one transaction with another.\r\n\r\nKapp speaks of a good copy of the _Corpus Juris_ as being valued in\r\n1350 at 1000 gold gulden.[396] He quotes a purchase made by a certain\r\nPrahel, in 1427, of a copy of _Livy_ for 120 gold gulden, and the\r\nsale of a _Plutarch_ in 1470 (twenty years after Gutenberg’s press\r\nbegan to work) for no less than 800 gold gulden. Jan Van Enkhuisen,\r\nof Zwolle, received in 1460 for an illuminated Bible 500 gold gulden,\r\nand for a Bible with a plain text (_einfach geschrieben_) 100 crowns.\r\nIn 1345, Etienne de Conty paid for a handsomely adorned copy of the\r\n_Commentaries_ of Henry Bohic, 62 livres and 11 sous, a sum which Kapp\r\ncalculates to be the equivalent of 825 francs in the money of the\r\npresent day. For the production of this work, there were paid to the\r\nscribes 31 livres and 5 sous, for the parchment 18 livres and 18 sous,\r\nfor six initials in gold, 1 livre and 10 sous, for other illuminations\r\n3 livres and 6 sous, for the hire of the manuscript (paid to the\r\nuniversity _bidellus_), 4 livres, and for binding the volume, 1 livre\r\n12 sous.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Anjou paid, in 1460, for a copy of the _Homilies_ of\r\nHaimon, Bishop of Halberstadt, two hundred sheep, five measures of\r\nwheat, and five measures of barley.\r\n\r\nIn 1474, Louis XI. of France, pledged as security for the safe return\r\nof a manuscript containing a treatise by the Arabic physician Rhases,\r\nwhich he had borrowed from the medical Faculty of the University of\r\nParis, his silver plate, while a nobleman also stood security for the\r\nKing in the transaction. In 1392, the Countess of Blois, wife of the\r\nBaron of Castellane, left in her will, as a bequest to her daughter, a\r\nmanuscript on parchment of the _Corpus Juris_. It was made a condition\r\nof the bequest that the daughter should marry a jurist, in order that\r\nthis valuable treasure could come into the right hands.\r\n\r\nThe National Library in Paris contains two manuscripts of the Bible\r\nin Latin and French text, written on parchment, which Firmin Didot\r\nappraised as having cost to produce not less than the equivalent of\r\n82,000 francs. He excludes from this calculation of cost the price\r\nof the parchment, the hire of the scribes, and the cost of the\r\nbinding. The principal item of the outlay for the more valuable of\r\nthese manuscripts was incurred in the production of the 5,000 designs\r\nilluminated in gold and colour, the cost of preparing which Didot\r\nestimated at over 12,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAs before pointed out, the exceptional outlay incurred in the\r\nproduction of these illuminated manuscripts cannot be taken as in any\r\nway a guide for the average market price of manuscripts prepared for\r\ngeneral circulation and sale. The text-books, chap-books, etc., which,\r\nduring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, were prepared for the\r\ncommon folk, sold at prices that seem very low when one bears in mind\r\nthe large amount of manual labour required for their production. The\r\nschool ordinance of the town of Bautzen (in Saxony) of 1418 fixed\r\nthe price of an _A B C_ book, containing also a _Paternoster_, at\r\none groschen; of a _Doctrinal_, a half mark; and of a _Donatus_, ten\r\ngroschens.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, the market price in the same region for a hen\r\nwas one pfennig, for a pound of beef two pfennigs, for a loaf of\r\nbread, containing rations for three men for one day, three pfennigs,\r\nfor a pound of cheese one pfennig, for a measure of the best wine one\r\nkreutzer.\r\n\r\nFrom this date on, however, there came to be, with the increase in\r\nthe production of manuscript books in the common text, a very steady\r\ndecrease in the selling price of such books.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourteenth century the average price in Italy for a\r\nwell written copy of the _Corpus Juris_ was 480 marks. In 1451, such a\r\ncopy was sold in Florence for 14½ ducats, the equivalent of 90 marks.\r\n\r\nIn 1400, a manuscript containing writings of Justinian, Sallust, and\r\nSuetonius, written on 115 folio sheets of parchment, was sold in\r\nFlorence for 16 ducats, the equivalent of 100 marks. In 1467, a copy of\r\nthe comedies of Terence, written on 198 folio sheets (paper, however,\r\ninstead of parchment), was bought in Heidelberg for three gulden. By\r\nthis date, sixteen years, namely, after the printing of Gutenberg’s\r\nfirst volume, the competition or the expectation of the competition of\r\nthe printing-press, had already begun to affect the market prices of\r\nmanuscripts. In 1499, there is record of the sale in Heidelberg for\r\nthe price of two gulden, of a manuscript comprising 134 quarto sheets,\r\ncontaining the _Hecuba_ of Euripides, and the _Idyls_ of Theocritus.\r\n\r\nIn not a few of the monasteries, even of those which had an old-time\r\nrepute for literary activity, the literary efforts came and went in\r\nwaves, and sometimes for long periods, extending over a generation or\r\nmore, there was an actual decrease in the extent of the attention given\r\nto the production of manuscripts and to the securing of additions to\r\nthe library. In other instances the development of the libraries went\r\non but slowly.\r\n\r\nC. Schmidt refers to the record of the library of the Strasburg\r\nCathedral, which in 1260 possessed a collection of fifty codices that\r\nhad been for the most part presented by Bishop Wernher as far back\r\nas 1027. In the year 1372, the catalogue of the library shows that\r\nthe number had increased to ninety-one, a gain of only forty-one\r\nmanuscripts in a space of more than one century.\r\n\r\nThe renewed interest that came to the scholars of Italy in the works of\r\nclassic writers with the revival of classical studies induced by the\r\nRenaissance caused manuscripts of these works to be searched for, not\r\nonly in Italy and in the countries of the East that could most easily\r\nbe reached by Italy, but throughout the monasteries of Europe. In 1517,\r\nthere is record of instruction being given by Pope Leo X. to a certain\r\ncleric named Heytmer to visit the libraries of the Palatinate and of\r\nthe adjoining districts and to search for classical manuscripts for\r\npurchase for the Papal collection. Heytmer was enjoined to make special\r\ninquiry for the missing books of Livy.\r\n\r\nAnother agent of Leo was fortunate enough to discover in the monastery\r\nof Corvey on the Weser the first five books of Tacitus. Being unable\r\nto induce the monastery to make sale of the manuscript, he succeeded\r\nin some way in appropriating it, and in getting it safely over the\r\nAlps. It was this manuscript that was used for the _editio princeps_\r\nof Tacitus, printed in Rome in 1515. The Pope sent to the library of\r\nthe Corvey monastery a copy of this printed edition of the Tacitus as\r\na restitution for the appropriated manuscript. The manuscript itself,\r\nin 1522, was taken (one does not know how) from Rome to Florence, where\r\nit is to-day chained in the Laurentian Library. I understand that\r\nthis Corvey text constituted the only copy of the first five books of\r\nTacitus which had been found when this author was first put into print.\r\n\r\n=The Manuscript Period in England.=--During the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries, in England as in ancient Greece, and as also\r\nin mediæval Italy, Southern France and Germany, the people who were\r\nprepared to interest themselves in literary productions, received\r\ntheir literature, or at least their poetical literature, very largely\r\nby means of reciters or minstrels. In the prologue to his _Troilus\r\nand Cressida_, Chaucer tells us it was intended to be read _or elles\r\nsung_. George Ellis points out that this must relate to the chanting\r\nrecitation of the minstrels. Ellis goes on to say: “A considerable\r\npart of our old poetry is simply addressed to an audience, without any\r\nmention of readers. That our English minstrels at any time united all\r\nthe talents of the profession, and were at once poets and reciters and\r\nmusicians, is extremely doubtful; but that they excited and directed\r\nthe efforts of their contemporary poets to a particular species of\r\ncomposition, is as evident as that a body of actors must influence the\r\nexertions of theatrical writers. They were, at a time when reading\r\nand writing were rare accomplishments, the principal medium of\r\ncommunication between authors and the public; and their memory in some\r\nmeasure supplied the deficiency of manuscripts, and probably preserved\r\nmuch of our early literature until the invention of printing.”[397]\r\n\r\nSays Jusserand: “At a time when books were rare, and when the theatre,\r\nproperly so-called, did not exist, poetry and music travelled with the\r\nminstrels and gleemen (_jongleurs_) along the highway, and such guests\r\nwere always welcome.”[398]\r\n\r\nThe connection of minstrelsy with the circulation of literature is\r\nreferred to by Charles Knight as follows: “A popular literature was\r\nkept alive and preserved, however imperfectly, before the press came to\r\nmake those who had learnt to read self-dependent in their intellectual\r\ngratifications; and what has come down to us of the old minstrelsy,\r\nwith all its inaccuracy and occasional feebleness, shows us that the\r\npeople of England, four or five centuries ago, had a common fund of\r\nhigh thought upon which a great literature might in time be reared. The\r\nvery existence of a poet like Chaucer is the best proof of the vigour,\r\nand to a certain extent of the cultivation, of the national mind, even\r\nin an age when books were rarities.”[399]\r\n\r\nAs early as the twelfth century, during such reigns as those of Henry\r\nI. (Beauclerc) and Henry II., there was in England a very considerable\r\nproduction of literature, under such various headings as chronicles,\r\nsatires, sermons, works of science and of medicine, treatises on style,\r\nprose romances, and epics in verse. Jusserand points out that a large\r\nproportion of these compositions were written in Latin.[400] This\r\nwould indicate a wider general understanding of Latin than prevailed\r\nthree centuries later when Caxton’s printing-press began its work;\r\nfor, as will be noted in the chapter on Caxton, the proportion of\r\nLatin books issued by Caxton was very much smaller than was the case\r\nwith the contemporary publishers in France and in Germany. Such an\r\nactive and varied literary production as that described by Jusserand\r\nwould also, of course, imply the existence of a considerable body of\r\ntrained scribes in addition to those who were at work in the monastic\r\n_scriptoria_ on the chronicles and books of devotion.\r\n\r\nThe very large measure of attention given to the production of legends\r\nand romances, and the great popularity of these among almost all\r\nclasses of the people, was the distinctive feature of the literature\r\nof England during the three centuries preceding the introduction of\r\nprinting. The scenes of many of these romances are laid in classic\r\ntimes, and their characters bear classic names; but the stories are\r\nhardly constructed on classic lines, and very little attempt is made\r\nto preserve what the dramatic critic in _Nicholas Nickleby_ calls “the\r\noneness of the drama.” Antiquity is presented in the garb of the Middle\r\nAges. As Jusserand remarks: “Everything in these poems was really\r\ntranslated; not only the language of the ancients but their raiment,\r\ntheir civilisation, their ideas. Venus becomes a princess: the heroes\r\nare knights, and their costumes, pictured in the illuminations, are so\r\nmuch in the fashion of the day that they serve us to date the poems.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to these classic romances, in which old-time heroes\r\nmasquerade in mediæval garb and speak in mediæval language, there is\r\na long series of tales which appear to have been of English origin.\r\nEnglish readers and English writers of the time seem to have possessed\r\na special penchant for story-telling. “Prose tales were written in\r\nastonishing quantities in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by pious\r\nauthors who under pretext of edifying and amusing their readers at\r\nthe same time, began by amusing and frequently forgot to edify.”[401]\r\nThe Welshman, Walter Map, became famous at the Court of Henry II. for\r\nhis satires and humorous stories. His work was done in Latin. His _De\r\nNugis Curiatum_ secured the most abiding repute. He might perhaps\r\nbe considered as a twelfth-century Martial. That famous body of\r\nstories, the _Gesta Romanorum_, heretofore believed to be the result\r\nof German reshaping of legends originating with the monks of Italy,\r\nis now claimed to have been first compiled in England towards the\r\nend of the thirteenth century.[402] The _Gesta_ was one of the most\r\nwidely circulated books in Europe (outside of the accepted devotional\r\nclassics) both in the manuscript period, and during the first century\r\nof printing.\r\n\r\nThe stories of the time are of very varied origin and in many cases\r\nhad evidently, in the rewriting, undergone material modifications\r\nor transformations. Whether the language used be Latin, French, or\r\nEnglish, it is evident from the character of the tales that the writers\r\nwere addressing themselves not to any limited group of scholars and\r\nclerics, but to what would to-day be described as a popular circle of\r\nreaders and of hearers. Thomas Wright points out that even those tales\r\nwhich are presented in Latin give evidence from local references and\r\nfrom English quotations of having been written for Englishmen.[403]\r\n\r\nThe Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer, chief among the story-tellers\r\nof England, if not of Europe, were written about 1390. After the\r\nlong series of translations and adaptations, these tales of Chaucer\r\nmark a distinct epoch in the production of native romance, in which\r\ncharacters, incidents, and surroundings were alike English, although\r\nthere are many evidences of continental influences. The circulation of\r\nthe _Tales_ in manuscript form was very extended, and Caxton showed\r\nhis usual excellent judgment by including them in the first group of\r\npublications issued from his Westminster Press. This earliest printed\r\nedition was probably published in 1478. A second edition was issued by\r\nCaxton in 1484.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, as well from the history of the _Canterbury Tales_\r\nas from that of the long series of romances which had preceded them,\r\na history giving evidence of a wide-spread influence and repute, that\r\nthere must have been, during the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, a considerable book-production outside of the monastery\r\n_scriptoria_, and that there must also have been a fairly effective\r\nmachinery for the sale and distribution of the manuscript texts. The\r\nlatter were doubtless supplied in great part by the travelling pedlars,\r\nwho sold with their novelties in ribbons and trinkets the latest new\r\ntale, or the latest version of some very old tale.\r\n\r\nBooks in manuscript were included in the goods sold at certain of\r\nthe great fairs, such as that of Stourbridge (near Cambridge), St.\r\nGiles (near Oxford), and St. Bartholomew, in London.[404] After the\r\nintroduction of printing, such fairs did considerable business in\r\nthe sale not only of the chap-books and almanacs, which were carried\r\nabout in the pedlars’ packs, but also of substantial and costly works.\r\nProfessor Thorold Rogers explains that the rapid diffusion of books\r\nand pamphlets at a time when newspapers and advertisements were still\r\nunknown, can only be accounted for by the understanding that the\r\nbook-dealers made large use of these fairs. He goes on to say that he\r\nfinds entries of purchases for the libraries of the Oxford colleges,\r\nwith the statement that the books were bought at St. Giles’s Fair.[405]\r\nIt will be remembered how two centuries or more after the period\r\nreferred to by Thorold Rogers, Michael Johnson, the father of Samuel,\r\nmade a practice of going on market days to Uttoxeter, taking there from\r\nhis book-shop in Litchfield books to be offered for sale on a stall\r\nin the market-place. The market days had, in 1725, replaced in great\r\nmeasure the old-time fairs. In the chapter on Germany, I have referred\r\nto the early use made of the Fair at Nordlingen by the dealers in\r\nmanuscripts, a practice which was later continued by the printers.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the manuscript-dealers were permitted to\r\ncarry on their trade in the chapels or within the enclosures of the\r\ncathedrals, as was so largely done by their contemporaries in Germany\r\nand in France. The extensive multiplication of books by copyists is\r\nless easy to account for. I have not been able thus far to find record\r\nof any considerable production, in London or other commercial centres,\r\nof books in manuscript, and I can only infer such production from the\r\nwide-spread circulation and influence of the books themselves.\r\n\r\nThe literary activities of England during these centuries of the\r\nmanuscript period were by no means limited to the production of\r\nfiction. The long series of contributions to local and national history\r\nmade by the monkish chroniclers have been referred to in a previous\r\nchapter. In the twelfth century, Orderic Vital or Vitalis writes his\r\n_Angligenæ Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ_, Henry of Huntingdon, his _Historia\r\nAnglorum_ (from A.C. 55 to A.D. 1154), and William of Malmesbury,\r\nhis _Gesta Regum Anglorum_. The _Historia Anglorum_ was printed in\r\n1586, at the expense of Sir Henry Savile. William of Malmesbury was,\r\nlike Richard de Bury, noted as a collector of books. His history was\r\nissued between 1112 and 1124. A few years later, in 1139, appears the\r\ngreat _Historia Regum Britanniæ_, of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Geoffrey\r\nbegins his British history with the earliest times, and, thanks, as he\r\nexplains, to certain special discoveries, or to a special revelation,\r\nhe is able to write with as much certainty about the reign of King\r\nArthur as concerning events of his own time. This chronicle must have\r\nbeen largely multiplied and widely distributed, as an exceptionally\r\nlarge number of copies have been preserved to the present time, the\r\nBritish Museum alone possessing no less than thirty-four.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the work of the historians is carried on\r\nby such writers as Roger of Wendover, and Matthew Paris, chief among\r\nEnglish chroniclers. In the fourteenth century, the most noteworthy\r\namong a long series of historical writers is Ralph Higden, author\r\nof the _Polychronicon_, or “Universal History,” which remained for\r\ncenturies an accepted authority.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, Bartholomew or Glanville compiles one of the\r\noldest of the general cyclopædias. Of this, many manuscripts have been\r\npreserved, eighteen of which are in the National Library in Paris.[406]\r\nJohn of Gaddesden, court physician under Edward II. (1310-1312), writes\r\na medical cyclopædia, or compendium of prescriptions, which not only\r\nsecures a European reputation at the time, but retains its prestige for\r\nnearly three centuries, and is issued in print in Augsburg, in 1595,\r\nin two quarto volumes. As early as the reign of Henry II. (1154-1189)\r\nan important group of law books had appeared, and the law treatises\r\nof Henry of Bracton, issued early in the thirteenth century, retained\r\ntheir value sufficiently to appear two centuries later in a printed\r\nedition, abridged from the original text. These few typical writers are\r\nreferred to simply as presenting some indication of the variety and of\r\nthe extent of the literary activities of England during the centuries\r\npreceding the beginning of printing. The popular interest in the works\r\nof such writers, and the great influence exerted by them upon the\r\nopinions of their own and of succeeding generations, is evidence of a\r\nconsiderable multiplication of copies and of an extended circulation,\r\nand this evidence is corroborated by the fact that of many of the books\r\nof the period so large a number of copies have been preserved to the\r\npresent time through the perils and vicissitudes of the intervening\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy example of the literary interests of Britain\r\nduring the manuscript period is afforded by Richard Aungerville,\r\nbetter known as Richard de Bury, Bishop Palatine of Durham, whose\r\nfamous _Philobiblon_ was given to the world in 1345. In his various\r\ntravels, and through his correspondents in England, France, and Italy,\r\nhe was able to get together a great collection of books, which were\r\nlater bequeathed to the University of Oxford. His eloquent tribute\r\nto his beloved books must, I judge, be taken rather as expressing\r\nthe enthusiasm of an exceptionally devoted scholar than as fairly\r\nrepresenting the literary spirit of the time:\r\n\r\n“Thanks to books, the dead appear to me as though they still lived....\r\nEverything decays and falls into dust by the force of time: Saturn is\r\nnever weary of devouring his children, and the glory of the world would\r\nbe buried in oblivion, had not God as a remedy conferred on mortal man\r\nthe benefit of books.... Books are the masters that instruct us without\r\nrods or ferules, without reprimands or anger, without the solemnity of\r\nthe gown or the expense of lessons. Go to them, you will not find them\r\nasleep: if you err, no scoldings on their part: if you are ignorant, no\r\nmocking laughter.”[407]\r\n\r\nIn 1344, (the year before his death) Richard writes as follows:\r\n\r\n“As it is necessary for a state to provide military arms, and prepare\r\nplentiful stores of provisions for soldiers who are about to fight,\r\nso it is evidently worth the labour of the church militant to fortify\r\nitself against the attacks of pagans and heretics with a multitude of\r\nsound books. But because everything that is serviceable to mortals\r\nsuffers the waste of mortality through lapse of time, it is necessary\r\nfor volumes corroded by age to be restored by renovated successors,\r\nthat perpetuity, repugnant to the nature of the individual, may be\r\nconceded to the species. Hence it is that Ecclesiastes significantly\r\nsays, in the 12th chapter. ‘There is no end of making many books.’\r\nFor, as the bodies of books suffer continued detriment from a combined\r\nmixture of contraries in their composition, so a remedy is found out\r\nby the prudence of clerks, by which a holy book paying the debt of\r\nnature may obtain an hereditary substitute, and a seed may be raised up\r\nlike to the most holy deceased, and that saying of Ecclesiasticus, be\r\nverified, ‘The father is dead and, as it were, not dead, for he hath\r\nleft behind him a son like unto himself.’”\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest authorities concerning book publishing in England\r\nis Bishop Fell, who in his Memoir on the State of Printing in the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, tells us that that university “possessed an\r\nexclusive right of transcribing and multiplying books by means of\r\nwriting,” a privilege which implies a species of copyright. The date\r\nreferred to is about 1600.\r\n\r\nIn both Oxford and Cambridge, according to the statutes in force\r\nbefore the introduction of printing, the _stationarii_ belonged to\r\nthe class of _Servientes_, who were appointed by the chancellor\r\nor vice-chancellor of the university. The records of Oxford show\r\nmany instances of the pawning of books by the undergraduates and\r\noccasionally by the instructors to the _stationarii_. In one codex,\r\nbelonging to Mr. Thomas Paunter, there is an inscription showing that\r\nit was pawned to a _stationarius_ in 1480, for the sum of thirty-eight\r\nshillings.[408] Books which had been so pledged, came frequently\r\nenough, after their forfeiture, into sale. An entry in the accounts\r\nof the library of S. John’s College in Cambridge, dating from 1456,\r\nrecords a payment made, apparently from the treasury of the college,\r\nfor the redemption of an _Avicenna_ from the _stationarius_ to whom\r\na certain John Marshall had pledged the manuscript. The cost of the\r\nredemption was £1. 6_s._ 4_d._[409]\r\n\r\nThe Oxford _stationarii_ finally secured privileges as members of\r\nthe university, but not before 1458, (as a result apparently of an\r\narrangement between the university and the city authorities), did this\r\nagreement take the _stationarii_ out of the jurisdiction of the city,\r\nand put them into the same class with the dealers in parchment, the\r\nilluminators, and the scribes, who for many years had been subordinated\r\nto the university. The taxes on the _stationarii_ were fixed by and\r\ncollected by the chancellor, and the proportion due to the city\r\ntreasury was paid over by him.\r\n\r\nThe term _stationarius_, which had, as we have seen, been in use for\r\nthese university dealers throughout all Europe, secured in Great\r\nBritain a permanent association with the book-trade by its use as an\r\nappellation for the publishers’ and booksellers’ guild, which was\r\nchartered in 1403 as “The Stationers’ Company.” Its headquarters in\r\nLondon was entitled Stationers’ Hall, and is still so known. The term\r\nin Great Britain, however, was made from a very early date to cover a\r\nlarger variety of trade undertakings than that to which it was limited\r\nin the university towns in Italy, France, and Germany. The business of\r\nselling manuscripts on commission, which was, as we have seen, kept\r\nunder very close supervision on the part of the university authorities\r\nof Paris and Bologna, appears to have been much less important in\r\nEngland, and the dealers seem for the most part to have been left free\r\nto make such terms either in buying or selling manuscripts as they saw\r\nfit, and as the necessities of their customers rendered practicable.\r\n\r\nAs early as the reign of Edward III. (1327-1377), there is record of a\r\nnumber of _stationarii_ as carrying on business in Oxford. In an Oxford\r\nmanuscript dating from this reign, there is an inscription of a certain\r\nMr. William Reed, of Merton College, who tells us that he purchased\r\nthis book from a _stationarius_.[410]\r\n\r\nIn London, there is record of an active trade in manuscripts being in\r\nexistence as early as the middle of the fourteenth century. The trade\r\nin writing materials, such as parchment, paper, and ink, appears not to\r\nhave been organised as in Paris, but to have been carried on in large\r\npart by the grocers and mercers. In the housekeeping accounts of King\r\nJohn of France, covering the period of his imprisonment in England, in\r\nthe years 1359 and 1360, occur entries such as the following:\r\n\r\n    “To Peter, a grocer of Lincoln, for four quaires of paper, two\r\n    shillings and four pence.”\r\n\r\n    “To John Huistasse, grocer, for a main of paper and a skin of\r\n    parchment, 10 pence.”\r\n\r\n    “To Bartholomew Mine, grocer, for three quaires of paper, 27\r\n    pennies.”[411]\r\n\r\nThe manuscript-trade in London concentrated itself in Paternoster Row,\r\nthe street which became afterwards the centre of the trade in printed\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThe earliest English manuscript-dealer whose name is on record is\r\nRichard Lynn, who, in the year 1358, was _stationarius_ in Oxford.[412]\r\nThe name of John Browne occurs in several Oxford manuscripts on about\r\nthe date of 1400. Nicholas de Frisia, an Oxford _librarius_ of about\r\n1425, was originally an undergraduate. He did energetic work as a book\r\nscribe and, later, appears to have carried on an important business in\r\nmanuscripts. His inscription is found first on a manuscript entitled\r\n_Petri Thomæ Quæstiones_, etc., which manuscript has been preserved in\r\nthe library of Merton.\r\n\r\nThere is record, as early as 1359, of a manuscript-dealer in the town\r\nof Lincoln who called himself Johannes _Librarius_, and who sold, in\r\n1360, several books to the French King John. It is a little difficult\r\nto understand how in a quiet country town like Lincoln with no\r\nuniversity connections, there should have been enough business in the\r\nfourteenth century to support a _librarius_.\r\n\r\nThe earliest name on record in London is that of Thomas Vycey, who was\r\na _stationarius_ in 1433. A few years later we find on a parchment\r\nmanuscript containing the wise sayings of a certain Lombardus, the\r\ninscription of Thomas Masoun, “_librarius of gilde hall_.”\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1461 and 1475, a certain Piers Bauduyn, dealer in\r\nmanuscripts, and also a bookbinder, purchased a number of books for\r\nEdward IV. In the household accounts of Edward appears the following\r\nentry: “Paid to Piers Bauduyn, bookseller, for binding, gilding and\r\ndressing a copy of Titus Livius, 20 shillings; for binding, gilding and\r\ndressing a copy of the Holy Trinity, 16 shillings; for binding, gilding\r\nand dressing a work entitled ‘The Bible’ 16 shillings.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Praat, who was a mercer of London, between the years 1470 and\r\n1480 busied himself also with the trade in manuscripts, and purchased,\r\nfor William Caxton, various manuscripts from France and from Belgium.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff finds record of manuscript-dealers in Spain as early as the\r\nfirst decade of the fifteenth century. He prints the name, however, of\r\nbut one, a certain Antonius Raymundi, a _librarius_ of Barcelona, whose\r\ninscription, dated 1413, appears in a manuscript of Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER PRINTED BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER PRINTED BOOKS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE RENAISSANCE AS THE FORERUNNER OF THE PRINTING-PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE fragments of classic literature which had survived the destruction\r\nof the Western Empire, had, as we have seen, owed their preservation\r\nchiefly to the Benedictine monasteries. Upon the monasteries also\r\nrested, for some centuries after the overthrow of the Gothic Kingdom of\r\nItaly, the chief responsibility for maintaining such slender thread of\r\ncontinuity of intellectual activity, and of interest in literature as\r\nremained. By the beginning of the twelfth century, this responsibility\r\nwas shared with, if not entirely transferred to, the older of the great\r\nuniversities of Europe, such as Bologna and Paris, which from that time\r\ntook upon themselves, as has been indicated, the task of directing\r\nand of furthering, in connection with their educational work, the\r\nincreasing literary activities of the scholarly world.\r\n\r\nWith the increase throughout Europe of schools and universities, there\r\nhad come a corresponding development in literary interests and in\r\nliterary productiveness or reproductiveness. The universities became\r\npublishing centres, and through the multiplication and exchange of\r\nmanuscripts, the scholars of Europe began to come into closer relations\r\nwith each other, and to constitute a kind of international scholarly\r\ncommunity. The development of such world-wide relations between\r\nscholars was, of course, very much furthered by the fact that Latin\r\nwas universally accepted as the language not only of scholarship but\r\npractically of all literature.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, by the beginning of the fourteenth century, intellectual\r\ninterests and literary activities had expanded beyond the scholastic\r\ncircles of the universities, and were beginning to influence larger\r\ndivisions of society. The year 1300 witnessed the production in\r\nFlorence of the _Divine Comedy_ of Dante, and marked an epoch in the\r\nhistory of Italy and in the literature of the world. During the two\r\ncenturies which followed, Florence remained the centre of a keener,\r\nricher, and more varied intellectual life than was known in any other\r\ncity in Europe.\r\n\r\nWith the great intellectual movement known as the Renaissance, I\r\nam concerned, for the purposes of this study, only to indicate the\r\ninfluence it exerted in preparing Italy and Europe for the utilisation\r\nof the printing-press. The work of the Renaissance included, partly as\r\na cause, and partly as an effect, the rediscovery for the Europe of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries of the literature of classic Greece,\r\nas well as the reinterpretation of the literature of classic Rome.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the literary awakening and of the newly discovered\r\nmasterpieces would of necessity have been restricted to a comparatively\r\nlimited scholarly circle, if it had not been for the invention of\r\nGutenberg and for the scholarly enterprise and devotion of such\r\nfollowers of Gutenberg as Aldus, Estienne, and Froben. It is, of\r\ncourse, equally true that if the intellectual world had not been\r\nquickened and inspired by the teachers of the Renaissance, the presses\r\nof Aldus would have worked to little purpose, and their productions\r\nwould have found few buyers. Aldus may, in fact, himself be considered\r\nas one of the most characteristic and valuable of the products of the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance has been described by various historians, and analysed\r\nby many commentators. The work which has, however, been accepted as\r\nthe most comprehensive account of the movement and the best critical\r\nanalysis of its nature and influence, and which presents also a vivid\r\nand artistic series of pictures of Italy and the Italians during\r\nthe fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, is Symonds’\r\n_Renaissance in Italy_. These volumes are so thoroughly imbued with\r\nthe spirit of the period, and the author’s characterisations are so\r\nfull and so sympathetic, that it is difficult not to think of Symonds\r\nas having been himself a Florentine, rather than a native of the\r\n“barbarian realm of Britain.”\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of quoting the description given by Symonds of the\r\npeculiar conditions under which Italy of the fifteenth century, in\r\nabandoning the hope of securing a place among the nations of the world,\r\nabsorbed itself in philosophic, literary, and artistic ideals. Freshly\r\nimbued with Greek thought and Greek inspiration, Italy took upon itself\r\nthe rôle played centuries earlier by classic Greece, and, without\r\npolitical power or national influence, it assumed the leadership of the\r\nintellect and of the imagination of Europe.\r\n\r\n“In proportion as Italy lost year by year the hope of becoming a united\r\nnation, in proportion as the military instincts died in her, and the\r\npolitical instincts were extinguished by despotism, in precisely the\r\nsame ratio did she evermore acquire a deeper sense of her intellectual\r\nvocation. What was world-embracing in the spirit of the mediæval Church\r\npassed by transmutation into the humanism of the fifteenth century. As\r\nthough aware of the hopelessness of being Italians in the same sense\r\nas the natives of Spain were Spaniards, or the natives of France were\r\nFrenchmen, the giants of the Renaissance did their utmost to efface\r\ntheir nationality, in order that they might the more effectually\r\nrestore the cosmopolitan ideal of the human family. To this end both\r\nartists and scholars, the depositories of the real Italian greatness at\r\nthis epoch, laboured; the artists by creating an ideal of beauty with\r\na message and a meaning for all Europe; the scholars by recovering for\r\nEurope the burghership of Greek and Roman civilisation. In spite of\r\nthe invasions and convulsions that ruined Italy between the years 1494\r\nand 1527, the painters and the humanists proceeded with their task as\r\nthough the fate of Italy concerned them not, as though the destinies\r\nof the modern world depended on their activity. After Venice had been\r\ndesolated by the armies of the League of Cambray, Aldus Manutius\r\npresented the peace-gift of Plato to the foes of his adopted city, and\r\nwhen the Lutherans broke into Parmegiano’s workshop at Rome, even they\r\nwere awed by the tranquil majesty of the Virgin on his easel. Stories\r\nlike these remind us that Renaissance Italy met her doom of servitude\r\nand degradation in the spirit of ancient Hellas, repeating as they do\r\nthe tales told of Archimedes in his study, and of Paulus Emilius face\r\nto face with the Zeus of Phidias.[413]...\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the benefit conferred upon Europe by\r\nthe Italians at this epoch. The culture of the classics had to be\r\nreappropriated before the movement of the modern mind could begin,\r\nbefore the nations could start upon a new career of progress; the\r\nchasm between the old and the new world had to be bridged over. This\r\ntask of reappropriation the Italians undertook alone, and achieved\r\nat the sacrifice of their literary independence and their political\r\nfreedom. The history of the Renaissance literature in Italy is the\r\nhistory of self-development into the channels of scholarship and\r\nantiquarian research. The language created by Dante as a thing of\r\npower, polished by Petrarch as a thing of beauty, trained by Boccaccio\r\nas the instrument of melodious prose, was abandoned even by the Tuscans\r\nin the fifteenth century for revived Latin and newly discovered Greek.\r\nPatient acquisition took the place of proud inventiveness; laborious\r\nimitation of classical authors suppressed originality of style. The\r\nforce of mind which in the fourteenth century had produced a _Divine\r\nComedy_ and a _Decameron_, in the fifteenth century was expended upon\r\nthe interpretation of codices, the settlement of texts, the translation\r\nof Greek books into Latin, the study of antiquities, the composition\r\nof commentaries, encyclopædias, dictionaries, ephemerides. While\r\nwe regret this change from creative to acquisitive literature, we\r\nmust bear in mind that these scholars, who ought to have been poets,\r\naccomplished nothing less than the civilisation, or, to use their own\r\nphrase, the humanisation, of the modern world. At the critical moment\r\nwhen the Eastern Empire was being shattered by the Turks, and when\r\nthe other European nations were as yet unfit for culture, Italy saved\r\nthe Arts and Sciences of Greece and Rome, and interpreted the spirit\r\nof the classics. Devoting herself to what appears the slavish work of\r\ncompilation and collection, she transmitted an inestimable treasure\r\nto the human race; and though for a time the beautiful Italian tongue\r\nwas superseded by a jargon of dead languages, yet the literature\r\nof the Renaissance yielded in the end the poetry of Ariosto, the\r\npolitical philosophy of Machiavelli, the histories of Guicciardini and\r\nVarchi. Meanwhile the whole of Europe had received the staple of its\r\nintellectual education.”[414]\r\n\r\nSymonds finds in the age of the Renaissance, or in what he calls\r\nthe Humanistic movement, four principal periods: first, the age of\r\ninspiration and discovery, which is initiated by Petrarch; second,\r\nthe period of arrangement and translation. During this period, the\r\nfirst great libraries came into existence, the study of Greek began\r\nin the principal universities, and the courts of Cosimo de’ Medici in\r\nFlorence, Alfonso in Naples, and Nicholas in Rome, became centres of\r\nliterary activity; third, the age of academies. This period succeeded\r\nthe introduction of printing into Italy. Scholars and men of letters\r\nare now crystallising or organising themselves into cliques or schools,\r\nunder the influence of which a more critical and exact standard of\r\nscholarship is arrived at, while there is a marked development in\r\nliterary form and taste. Of the academies which came into existence,\r\nthe most important were the Platonic in Florence, that of Pontanus in\r\nNaples, that of Pomponius Lætus in Rome, and that of Aldus Manutius in\r\nVenice. This period covered, it is to be noted, the introduction of\r\nprinting into Italy (1464) and its rapid development. In the fourth\r\nperiod it may be said that scholasticism to some extent took the place\r\nof scholarship. It was the age of the purists, of whom Bembo was both\r\nthe type and the dictator. There is a tendency to replace learning\r\nwith an exaggerated attention to æsthetics and style. It was about the\r\nCourt of Leo X. (1513-1522) that these æsthetic _literati_ were chiefly\r\ngathered. “Erudition, properly so-called,” says Symonds, “was now upon\r\nthe point of being transplanted beyond the Alps.”\r\n\r\nThe names of the scholars and writers who, following Dante, gave fame\r\nto Florence and to Italy, are part of the history of the world’s\r\nliterature. It is necessary to refer here only to those whose influence\r\nwas most important in widening the range of scholarly interests and\r\nin preparing Italy and Europe for the diffusion of literature, a\r\npreparation which, while emphasising the requirement for some means of\r\nmultiplying books cheaply, secured for the printing-press, as soon\r\nas its work began, an assured and sufficient support. The fact that a\r\nperiod of exceptional intellectual activity and literary productiveness\r\nimmediately preceded the invention, or at least the introduction of\r\nprinting, must have had an enormous influence in furthering the speedy\r\ndevelopment and diffusion of the new art. The press of Aldus Manutius\r\nseems, as before said, like a natural and necessary outgrowth of the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nThe typical feature of the revival of learning in Italy was, of course,\r\nthe rediscovery of the literature of Greece. In the poetic simile of\r\nSymonds, “Florence borrowed her light from Athens, as the moon shines\r\nwith rays reflected from the sun. The revival was the silver age of\r\nthat old golden age of Greece.”[415] The comparison of Florence with\r\nAthens has repeatedly been made. The golden ages of the two cities were\r\nseparated by nearly two thousand years; but history and human nature\r\nrepeat themselves, and historians have found in the Tuscan capital of\r\nthe fifteenth century a population which, with its keen intellectual\r\nnature, subtle and delicate wit, and restless political spirit, recalls\r\nclosely the Athens of Pericles. The leadership which belonged to Italy\r\nin literature, art, scholarship, and philosophy, was, within Italy,\r\nconceded to Florence.\r\n\r\nThe first name in the list of Florentine scholars whose influence\r\nwas important in this revival is that of Petrarch. He never himself\r\nmastered the Greek language, but he arrived at a realisation of the\r\nimportance of Greek thought for the world, and he preached to others\r\nthe value of the studies which were beyond his own grasp. It was at\r\nPetrarch’s instance that Boccaccio undertook the translation into Latin\r\nof the _Iliad_. Among Latin authors, Petrarch’s devotion was given\r\nparticularly to Cicero and Virgil. The fact that during the first\r\ncentury of printing more editions of Cicero were produced than of any\r\nother classic author must have been largely due to the emphasis given\r\nby the followers of Petrarch to the beauty of Cicero’s latinity and the\r\npermanent value of his writings.\r\n\r\nPetrarch was a devoted collector of manuscripts, and spared neither\r\nlabour nor expense to secure for his library codices of texts\r\nrecommended as authoritative. Notwithstanding his lack of knowledge\r\nof Greek, he purchased for his collection all the Greek manuscripts\r\nwhich came within his reach and within his means. Fortunately for\r\nthese expensive literary tastes, he appears to have possessed what we\r\nshould call a satisfactory independence. Some of his manuscripts went\r\nto Boccaccio, while the rest were, at his death, given to the city of\r\nFlorence and found place later in the Medicean Library.\r\n\r\nPetrarch laid great stress on the importance, for the higher education\r\nof the people, of efficient public libraries, and his influence with\r\nwealthy nobles served largely to increase the resources of several of\r\nthe existing libraries. In his scholarly appreciation of the value\r\nof such collections, he was helping to educate the community to\r\nsupport the booksellers, while in the collecting of manuscripts he was\r\nunwittingly doing valuable service for the coming printer. He died in\r\n1374, ninety years before the first printing-press began its work in\r\nItaly. A century later his beautiful script served as a model for the\r\nitalic or cursive type which was first made by Aldus.\r\n\r\nSymonds thinks it very doubtful whether the Italians would have\r\nundertaken the labour of recovering the Greek classics if no Petrarch\r\nhad preached the attractiveness of liberal studies, and if no school of\r\ndisciples had been formed by him in Florence. Of these disciples, by\r\nfar the most distinguished was Boccaccio. His actual work in furthering\r\nthe study of Greek was more important than that of the friend to whom\r\n(although there was a difference of but nine years in their ages) he\r\ngave the title of “master.” Boccaccio, taking up the study of Greek\r\n(at Petrarch’s instance) in middle life, secured a sufficient mastery\r\nof the language to be able to render into Latin the _Iliad_ and the\r\n_Odyssey_. This work, completed in 1362, was the first translation\r\nof Homer for modern readers. He had for his instructor and assistant\r\nan Italian named Leontius Pilatus, who had sojourned some years at\r\nByzantium, but whose knowledge of classic Greek was said to have been\r\nvery limited. Boccaccio secured for Pilatus an appointment as Greek\r\nprofessor in the University of Florence, the first professorship of\r\nGreek instituted in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe work by which Boccaccio is best known, the _Decameron_ or the _Ten\r\nNights’ Entertainment_, was published in 1353, a few years before the\r\ncompletion by Chaucer of the _Canterbury Tales_. It is described as\r\none of the purest specimens of Italian prose and as an inexhaustible\r\nrepository of wit, beauty, and eloquence; and notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the stories are representative of the low standard of moral tone\r\nwhich characterised Italian society of the fourteenth century, the\r\nbook is one which the world will not willingly let die. It is probably\r\nto-day in more continued demand than any book of its century, with the\r\npossible exception of the _Divine Comedy_. The earliest printed edition\r\nwas that of Valdarfer, issued in Florence in 1471. This was three years\r\nbefore the beginning of Caxton’s work as a printer in Bruges. The\r\n_Decameron_ has since been published in innumerable editions and in\r\nevery language of Europe.\r\n\r\nA far larger contribution to Hellenic studies was given some years\r\nlater by Manuel Chrysoloras, a Greek scholar of Byzantium, who,\r\nafter visiting Italy as an ambassador from the Court of the Emperor\r\nPalæologus, was, in 1396, induced to accept the Chair of Greek in the\r\nUniversity of Florence. “This engagement,” says Symonds, “secured\r\nthe future of Greek erudition in Europe.” Symonds continues: “The\r\nscholars who assembled in the lecture-rooms of Chrysoloras felt that\r\nthe Greek texts, whereof he alone supplied the key, contained those\r\nelements of spiritual freedom and intellectual culture without which\r\nthe civilisation of the modern world would be impossible. Nor were\r\nthey mistaken in what was then a guess rather than a certainty. The\r\nstudy of Greek implied the birth of criticism, comparison, research.\r\nSystems based on ignorance and superstition were destined to give way\r\nbefore it. The study of Greek opened philosophical horizons far beyond\r\nthe dream world of the churchmen and monks; it stimulated the germs\r\nof science, suggested new astronomical hypotheses, and indirectly led\r\nto the discovery of America. The study of Greek resuscitated a sense\r\nof the beautiful in art and literature. It subjected the creeds of\r\nChristianity, the language of the Gospels, the doctrines of St. Paul,\r\nto analysis, and commenced a new era of Biblical inquiry. If it be\r\ntrue, as a writer no less sober in his philosophy than eloquent in his\r\nlanguage has lately asserted, that except the blind forces of nature,\r\nnothing moves in this world which is not Greek in its origin, we are\r\njustified in regarding the point of contact between the Greek teacher\r\nChrysoloras and his Florentine pupils as one of the most momentous\r\ncrises in the history of civilisation. Indirectly the Italian intellect\r\nhad hitherto felt Hellenic influence through Latin literature. It was\r\nnow about to receive that influence immediately from actual study of\r\nthe masterpieces of the Attic writers. The world was no longer to be\r\nkept in ignorance of those ‘eternal consolations’ of the human race. No\r\nlonger could the scribe omit Greek quotations from his Latin text with\r\nthe dogged snarl of obtuse self-satisfaction, _Græca sunt, ergo non\r\nlegenda_. The motto had rather to be changed into a cry of warning for\r\necclesiastical authority upon the verge of dissolution, _Græca sunt,\r\nergo periculosa_; since the reawakening faith in human reason, the\r\nreawakening belief in the dignity of man, the desire for beauty, the\r\nliberty, audacity, and passion of the Renaissance, received from Greek\r\nstudies their strongest and most vital impulse.”\r\n\r\nSymonds might have added that the literary revival, which was so\r\nlargely due to these Greek studies, made possible, a century later,\r\nthe utilisation of the printing-press, the invention of which would\r\notherwise have fallen upon comparatively barren ground; while the\r\nprinting-press alone made possible the diffusion of the new knowledge,\r\noutside of the small circles of aristocratic scholars, to whole\r\ncommunities of impecunious students.\r\n\r\nFlorence had, as we have seen, done more than any other city of Italy,\r\nmore than any city of Europe, to prepare Italy and Europe for the\r\nappreciation and utilisation of the art of printing, but the direct\r\npart taken by Florence in the earlier printing undertakings was,\r\ncuriously enough, much less important than that of Venice, Rome, or\r\nMilan. By the year 1500, that is, thirty-six years after the beginning\r\nof printing in Italy, there had been printed in Florence 300 works, in\r\nBologna 298, in Milan 629, in Rome 925, and in Venice 2835.\r\n\r\nThe list of the scholars and men of letters who, during the century\r\nfollowing the work of Petrarch and Boccaccio, associated themselves\r\nwith the brilliant society of Florence, and retained for the city its\r\ndistinctive pre-eminence in the intellectual life of Europe, is a long\r\none, and includes such names as those of Tommaso da Sarzana, Palla\r\ndegli Strozzi, Giovanni da Ravenna, Niccolo de’ Niccoli, Filelfo,\r\nMarsuppini, Rossi, Bruni, Guicciardini, Poggio, Galileo, Cellini,\r\nPlethon, and Machiavelli. It was to Strozzi that was due the beginning\r\nof Greek teaching in Florence under Manuel Chrysoloras, while he\r\nalso devoted large sums of money to the purchase in Greece and in\r\nConstantinople of valuable manuscripts. He kept in his house skilled\r\ncopyists, and was employing these in the work of preparing transcripts\r\nfor a great public library, when, unfortunately for Florence, he\r\nincurred the enmity of Cosimo de’ Medici, who procured his banishment.\r\nStrozzi went to Padua, where he continued his Greek studies.\r\n\r\nCosimo, having vanquished his rival in politics, himself continued\r\nthe work of collecting manuscripts and of furthering the instruction\r\ngiven by the Greek scholars. The chief service rendered by Cosimo\r\nto learning and literature was in the organisation of great public\r\nlibraries. During his exile (1433-1434), he built in Venice the\r\nLibrary of S. Giorgio Maggiore, and after his return to Florence, he\r\ncompleted the hall for the Library of S. Marco. He also formed several\r\nlarge collections of manuscripts. To the Library of S. Marco and to\r\nthe Medicean Library were bequeathed later by Niccolo de’ Niccoli\r\n800 manuscripts, valued at 600 gold florins. Cosimo also provided a\r\nvaluable collection of manuscripts for the convent of Fiesole. The\r\noldest portion of the present Laurentian Library is composed of the\r\ncollections from these two convents, together with a portion of the\r\nmanuscripts preserved from the Medicean Library.\r\n\r\nIn 1438, Cosimo instituted the famous Platonic Academy of Florence, the\r\nspecial purpose of which was the interpretation of Greek philosophy.\r\nThe gathering in Florence, in 1438, of the Greeks who came to the\r\ngreat Council, had a large influence in stimulating the interest of\r\nFlorentines in Greek culture. Symonds (possibly somewhat biassed in\r\nfavour of his beloved Florentines of the Renaissance) contends that the\r\nByzantine ecclesiastics who came to the Council, and the long series of\r\nGreek travellers or refugees who found their way from Constantinople\r\nto Italy during the years that followed, included comparatively few\r\nreal scholars whose classical learning could be trusted. These men\r\nsupplied, says Symonds, “the beggarly elements of grammar, caligraphy,\r\nand bibliographical knowledge,” but it was Ficino and Aldus, Strozzi\r\nand Cosimo de’ Medici who opened the literature of Athens to the\r\ncomprehension of the modern world.\r\n\r\nThe elevation to the papacy, in 1447, of Tommaso Parentucelli, who took\r\nthe name of Nicholas V., had the effect of carrying to Rome some of\r\nthe Florentine interest in literature and learning. Tommaso, who was\r\na native of Pisa, had won repute in Bologna for his wide and thorough\r\nscholarship. He became, later, a protégé of Cosimo de’ Medici, who\r\nemployed him as a librarian of the Marcian Library. To Nicholas V.\r\nwas due the foundation of the Vatican Library, for which he secured a\r\ncollection of some five thousand works. Symonds says that during his\r\npontificate, “Rome became a vast workshop of erudition, a factory of\r\ntranslations from Greek and Latin.” The compensation paid to these\r\ntranslators from the funds provided by the Pope, was in many cases\r\nvery liberal. In fact, as compared with the returns secured at this\r\nperiod for original work, the rewards paid to these translators of the\r\nVatican seem decidedly disproportionate, especially when we remember\r\nthat a large portion of their work was of poor quality, deficient\r\nboth in exact scholarship and in literary form. To Lorenzo Valla was\r\npaid for his translation of Thucydides, 500 scudi, to Guarino for a\r\nversion of Strabo, 1500 scudi, to Perotti for Polybius, 500 ducats.\r\nManetti had a pension of 600 scudi a month to enable him to pursue\r\nhis sacred studies. Poggio’s version of the _Cyropædia_ of Xenophon\r\nand Filelfo’s rendering of the poems of Homer, were, from a literary\r\npoint of view, more important productions. Some of the work in his\r\nseries of translations was confided by the Pope to the resident Greek\r\nscholars. Trapezuntios undertook the _Metaphysics_ of Aristotle and\r\nthe _Republic_ of Plato, and Tifernas the _Ethics_ of Aristotle.\r\nTranslations were also prepared of Theophrastus and of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these paid translators, the Pope attracted to his Court\r\nfrom all parts of Italy, and particularly from his old home, Florence,\r\na number of scholars, of whom Poggio Bracciolini (or Fiorentino) and\r\nCardinal Bessarion were the most important. Bessarion took an active\r\npart in encouraging Greek scholars to make their homes and to do their\r\nwork in Italy. The great development of literary productiveness and\r\nliterary interests in Rome during the pontificate of Nicholas, is one\r\nof the noteworthy examples of large results accruing to literature and\r\nto literary workers through intelligently administered patronage. It\r\nseems safe to say that before the introduction of printing, it was only\r\nthrough the liberality of patrons that any satisfactory compensation\r\ncould be secured for literary productions.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Alfonso of Aragon, who in 1435 added Sicily to\r\nhis dominions, and under the direct incentive of the royal patronage,\r\na good deal of literary activity was developed in Naples. Alfonso\r\nwas described by Vespasiano as being, next to Nicholas V., the most\r\nmunificent patron of learning in Italy, and he attracted to his Court\r\nscholars like Manetti, Beccadelli, Valla, and others. The King paid to\r\nBartolommeo Fazio a stipend of 500 ducats a year while he was engaged\r\nin writing his _Chronicles_, and when the work was completed, he added\r\na further payment of 1500 florins. In 1459, the year of his death,\r\nAlfonso distributed 20,000 ducats among the men of letters gathered\r\nin Naples. It is certain that in no other city of Europe during that\r\nyear were the earnings or rewards of literature so great. It does\r\nnot appear, however, that this lavish expenditure had the effect of\r\nsecuring the production by Neapolitans of any works of continued\r\nimportance, or even of bringing into existence in the city any lasting\r\nliterary interests. The temperament of the people and the general\r\nenvironment were doubtless unfavourable as compared with the influences\r\naffecting Florence or Rome. It is probable also that the selection of\r\nthe recipients of the royal bounty was made without any trustworthy\r\nprinciple and very much at haphazard.\r\n\r\nA production of Beccadelli’s, perhaps the most brilliant of Alfonso’s\r\nliterary protégés, is to be noted as having been proscribed by\r\nthe Pope, being one of the earliest Italian publications to be so\r\ndistinguished. Eugenius IV. forbade, under penalty of excommunication,\r\nthe reading of Beccadelli’s _Hermaphroditus_, which was declared to be\r\n_contra bonos mores_. The book was denounced from many pulpits, and\r\ncopies were burned, together with portraits of the poet, on the public\r\nsquares of Bologna, Milan, and Ferrara.[416] This opposition of the\r\nChurch was the more noteworthy, as the book contained nothing heretical\r\nor subversive of ecclesiastical authority, but was simply ribald and\r\nobscene.\r\n\r\nLorenzo Valla, another of the writers who received special favours\r\nand emoluments at the hands of Alfonso, likewise came under the\r\necclesiastical ban. But his writings contained more serious offences\r\nthan obscenity or ribaldry. He boldly questioned the authenticity of\r\nConstantine’s _Donation_ (a document which was later shown to be a\r\nforgery), and of other documents and literature held by the Church\r\nto be sacred, and the accuracy of his scholarship and the brilliancy\r\nof his polemical style, gave weight and force to his attacks.\r\nDenunciations came upon Valla’s head from many pulpits, and the matter\r\nwas taken up by the Inquisition. But Alfonso told the monks that they\r\nmust leave his secretary alone, and the proceedings were abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen Nicholas V. came to the papacy, undeterred by the charge of\r\nheresies, he appointed Valla to the post of Apostolic writer, and\r\ngave him very liberal emoluments for work on the series of Greek\r\ntranslations before referred to. Valla never retracted any of his\r\nutterances against the Church, but he appears, after accepting the\r\nPope’s appointment, to have turned his polemical ardour in other\r\ndirections. He engaged in some bitter controversies with Poggio, Fazio,\r\nand other contemporaries, controversies which seem to have aroused and\r\nexcited the literary circles of the time, but which turned upon matters\r\nof no lasting importance. It is a cause of surprise to later literary\r\nhistorians that men like Valla, possessed of real learning and of\r\nunquestioned literary skill, should have been willing to devote their\r\ntime and their capacity to the futilities which formed the pretexts for\r\nthe greater part of the personal controversies of the time. Professor\r\nAdams says of Valla: “He had all the pride and insolence and hardly\r\ndisguised pagan feeling and morals of the typical humanist; but in\r\nspirit and methods of work he was a genuine scholar, and his editions\r\nlie at the foundation of all later editorial work in the case of more\r\nthan one classic author, and of the critical study of the New Testament\r\nas well.”[417]\r\n\r\nDuring the two centuries preceding the invention of printing, it was\r\nthe case that more books (in the form of manuscripts) were available\r\nfor the use of students and readers in Italy than in any other country,\r\nbut even in Italy manuscripts were scarce and costly. Even the\r\ncollections in the so-called “libraries” of the cathedrals and colleges\r\nwere very meagre. These manuscripts were nearly entirely the production\r\nof the cloisters, and as parchment continued to be very dear, many of\r\nthe works sent out by the monks were in the form of palimpsests, that\r\nis, were transcribed upon scrolls which contained earlier writing.\r\nThe fact that the original writing was in many cases but imperfectly\r\nerased, has caused to be preserved fragments of a number of classics\r\nwhich might otherwise have disappeared entirely. The service rendered\r\nby the monks in this way may be considered as at least a partial\r\noffset to the injury done by them to the cause of literature in the\r\ndestruction of so many ancient writings. This matter has been referred\r\nto more fully in the chapter on Monasteries and Manuscripts.\r\n\r\nOne of the Italian scholars of the fifteenth century who interested\r\nhimself particularly in the collection of manuscripts of the classics\r\nwas Poggio Bracciolini. In 1414, while he was, in his official capacity\r\nas Apostolic Secretary, in attendance at the Council of Constance,\r\nhe ransacked the libraries of St. Gall and of other monasteries of\r\nSwitzerland and Suabia, and secured a complete _Quintilian_, copies\r\nof _Lucretius_, _Frontinus_, _Probus_, _Vitruvius_, nine of Cicero’s\r\n_Orations_, and manuscripts of a number of other valuable texts. Many\r\nof the libraries had been sadly neglected, and the greater part of the\r\nmanuscripts were in dirty and tattered condition, but literature owes\r\nmuch to the monks through whom these literary treasures had been kept\r\nin existence at all.\r\n\r\nPoggio is to be noted as a free-thinker who managed to keep in good\r\nrelations with the Church. So long as free-thinkers confined their\r\naudacity to such matters as form the topic of Poggio’s _Facetiæ_,\r\nBeccadelli’s _Hermaphroditus_, or La Casa’s _Capitolo del Forno_, the\r\nRoman Curia looked on and smiled approvingly. The most obscene books to\r\nbe found in any literature escaped the Papal censure, and a man like\r\nAretino, notorious for his ribaldry, could aspire with fair prospects\r\nof success to the scarlet of a Cardinal.[418]\r\n\r\nWhile there could be no popular distribution, in the modern sense of\r\nthe term, for necessarily costly books in manuscript, in a community of\r\nwhich only a small proportion had any knowledge of reading and writing,\r\nit is evident from the chronicles of the time that there was an active\r\nand prompt exchange of literary novelties between the court circles\r\nand the literary groups of the different cities, and also between the\r\nFaculties of the universities. A controversy between two scholars or\r\nmen of letters (and there were, as said, many such controversies, some\r\nof them exceedingly bitter) appears to have excited a larger measure\r\nof interest and attention in cultivated circles throughout the country\r\nthan could probably be secured to-day for any purely literary or\r\nscholastic issues. There must, therefore, have been in existence and\r\nin circulation a very considerable mass of literature in manuscript\r\nform, and we know from various sources that Florence particularly\r\nwas the centre of an important trade in manuscripts. I have not thus\r\nfar, however, been able to find any instances of the writers of this\r\nperiod receiving any compensation from the publishers, booksellers, or\r\ncopyists, or any share in such profits as might be derived from the\r\nsale of the manuscript copies of their writings. It seems probable that\r\nthe authors gave to the copyists the privilege (which it was in any\r\ncase really impracticable to withhold) of manifolding and distributing\r\nsuch copies of the books as might be called for by the general public,\r\nwhile the cost of the complimentary copies (often a considerable\r\nnumber) given to the large circle of friends, seems as a rule to have\r\nbeen borne by the author.\r\n\r\nAs the author had to take his compensation in the shape of fame (except\r\nin the cases of receipts from patrons), the wider the circulation\r\nsecured for copies of his productions (provided only they were not\r\nplagiarised), the larger his fund of--satisfaction. For substantial\r\ncompensation he could look only to the patron. Fortunately for the\r\nimpecunious writers of the day, it became fashionable for not a few of\r\nthe princes and nobles of Italy to play the rôle of Mæcenas, and by\r\nmany of these the support and encouragement given to literature was\r\nmagnificent, if not always judicious.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of the last Visconti and of the first Sforza, or\r\nfrom about 1440 to 1474, literature became fashionable at the Court\r\nof Milan. Filippo Maria Visconti is described as a superstitious and\r\nrepulsive tyrant, and he could hardly by his own personality have\r\nattracted to Lombardy men of intellectual tastes. Visconti appears,\r\nhowever, to have considered that his Court would be incomplete\r\nwithout scholars, and to have been willing to pay liberally for their\r\nattendance. Piero Candido Decembrio was one of the most industrious of\r\nthe writers who were supported by Visconti. According to his epitaph,\r\nhe was responsible for no less than 127 books. Symonds speaks of his\r\nmemoir of Visconti as a vivid and vigorous study of a tyrant. Gasparino\r\nda Barzizza was the Court letter-writer and rhetorician, and, as the\r\nofficial orator, filled an important place in what was considered the\r\nintellectual life of the city.\r\n\r\nBy far the most noteworthy, however, of the scholars who were attracted\r\nto Milan by the Ducal bounty was Francesco Filelfo. He could hardly\r\nbe said to belong to Lombardy, as he was born in Ancona and educated\r\nat Padua, and had passed a number of years in Venice, Constantinople,\r\nFlorence, Siena, and Bologna. The longest sojourn of his life, however,\r\nwas made in Milan, where he arrived in 1440, and where he enjoyed for\r\nsome years liberal emoluments from the Court.\r\n\r\nFilelfo was evidently a man with great powers of acquisition and with\r\nexceptional versatility. He brought back with him from Constantinople\r\n(where he had remained for some years) a Greek bride from a noble\r\nfamily, an extensive collection of Greek manuscripts, and a working\r\nknowledge of the Greek language; and at a time when Greek ideas and\r\nGreek literature were attracting the enthusiastic attention not\r\nmerely of the scholars but of the courtiers and men of fashion, these\r\npossessions of Filelfo were exceptionally serviceable, and enabled\r\nhim to push his fortunes effectively. He seems to have possessed a\r\nself-confidence at least equal to his learning. He speaks of himself\r\nas having surpassed Virgil because he was an orator, and Cicero\r\nbecause he was a poet. Symonds says, however, that, notwithstanding his\r\narrogance, he is entitled to the rank of the most universal scholar\r\nof his age, and his self-assertion doubtless aided not a little in\r\nsecuring prompt recognition for his learning. Venice paid him, in 1427,\r\na stipend of 500 sequins for a series of lectures on Eloquence. A year\r\nlater he accepted the post of lecturer in Bologna on Moral Philosophy\r\nand Eloquence, with a stipend of 450 sequins. Shortly afterwards,\r\nflattering offers tempted him to Florence, where he lectured on the\r\nGreek and Latin classics and on Dante, with a stipend first of 250\r\nsequins, and later of 450 sequins. He found time while there for the\r\npreparation of translations of the _Rhetoric_ of Aristotle, and of a\r\nnumber of other Greek works.\r\n\r\nFilelfo’s arrogance and bad temper, and his fondness for invective\r\nand satire, soon brought him into trouble with the literary circle of\r\nFlorence, and finally with the Medici, and he was compelled to withdraw\r\nto Siena, where he remained four years with a stipend of 350 florins.\r\nFrom there, after a brief visit to Bologna, he removed to Milan, where\r\nhis emoluments were much larger than any heretofore received, and\r\nwhere, in the absence of any other scholars of equal attainments or\r\nassumptions, he had the satisfaction of being the accepted literary\r\nleader of the capital. In addition to his professional salary,\r\nhe received large sums and presents for addresses, orations, and\r\ncommemorative poems, which he was always ready to prepare. Such a\r\ncombination of rhetoric and literature was peculiarly characteristic of\r\nthe Italy of the time, and may be said to constitute a distinct phase\r\nin the history of compensation for intellectual productions. Filelfo\r\npublished, in two ponderous volumes, his Satires, Odes, and other\r\nfugitive pieces, under the title of _Convivia Mediolanensia_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable sums which Filelfo earned through\r\nhis lectures and through his various rhetorical productions, he seems\r\nalways to have been in need of money. His tastes were expensive, while\r\nhis three wives had borne him no less than twenty-four children. In\r\nhis later years he gained the reputation of being very greedy of gold\r\nand of making impudent demands which bore very much the character of\r\nblackmail. Gregorio Lollio, writing (in 1452) to the Cardinal of Pavia,\r\ndescribes Filelfo in the following words: “He is calumnious, envious,\r\nvain, and so greedy of gold that he metes out praise or blame according\r\nto the gifts he gets, both despicable as proceeding from a tainted\r\nsource.”[419]\r\n\r\nFrom Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, he received a liberal stipend.\r\nPope Nicholas V., after reading some of his Satires (which Symonds\r\ncharacterises as “infamous”) presented him with 500 ducats. Travelling\r\nfrom Rome to Naples, Filelfo received more presents from Alfonso, who\r\ndubbed him a knight. Continuing his journey, he secured honours and\r\nrewards in Ferrara from Duke Borso, in Mantua from Marchese Gonzaga,\r\nand in Rimini from Gismondo Malatesta. After the death of Sforza, he\r\naccepted, in 1475, from Pope Sixtus IV., a professional Chair in Rome,\r\nwith a salary of 600 florins. He soon, however, quarrelled with the\r\nPope, and withdrew to Florence, where Lorenzo de’ Medici provided a\r\npost for him as Professor of Greek Literature.\r\n\r\nFilelfo died in Florence in his eighty-third year. He had probably\r\nreceived larger emoluments for his work as an instructor, as a\r\nrhetorician, and as a man of letters, than any man of his generation,\r\nbut he died without any means, and was buried by the charity of\r\nthe Florentines. His career, in its activities, vicissitudes,\r\ncontroversies, successes, and bitternesses, was very typical of the\r\nlives of the Italian scholars of the period.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Filelfo’s death, while in many other cities the\r\ninfluence of the Renaissance was bringing together collections of books\r\nand circles of scholars, and literary productiveness was increasing\r\nthroughout Italy, Florence still remained the capital of learning and\r\nof refined culture. Lorenzo de’ Medici had, in 1469, succeeded to\r\nPietro, and of all the Medici it was Lorenzo whose influence was the\r\nmost important in furthering the intellectual and artistic movements\r\nof the time. Symonds speaks of him as “a man of marvellous variety and\r\nrange of mental power, in whom ... the versatility of the Renaissance\r\nfound its fullest incarnation.”\r\n\r\nLorenzo attracted to his villa the greatest scholars and most brilliant\r\nmen of the time, a circle which included Poliziano, Landino, Ficino,\r\nPico della Mirandola, Alberti, Pulci, and Michael Angelo. The interests\r\nof this circle, as of all similar Italian circles of the time, were\r\nlargely absorbed in the philosophy and literature of Greece, and\r\nspecial attention was devoted to the teachings of Plato. Plato’s\r\nwritings were translated into Latin by Ficino, and the translation\r\nwas printed in 1482, at the cost of Filippo Valvio. Ficino was too\r\npoor himself to undertake the publication of his works, and this was\r\nthe case with not a few of the distinguished authors of the age. The\r\npresentation of books to the public required at this time what might be\r\ncalled the endowment of literature, an endowment which was supplied by\r\nthe liberality of wealthy patrons possessed of literary appreciation\r\nor public-spirited ambition, or of both. As Symonds expresses it,\r\n“Great literary undertakings involved in that century the substantial\r\nassistance of wealthy men, whose liberality was rewarded by a notice\r\nin the colophon or in the title-page.” The formal dedication was an\r\ninvention of a somewhat later date.\r\n\r\nThe Ficino edition of _Plotinus_, printed at the expense of Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici, and published a few weeks after his death, bears the\r\ninscription, _Magnifici sumptu Laurentii patriæ servatoris_. The\r\nedition of _Homer_ of Lorenzo Alopa, issued in 1488, was printed at the\r\nexpense of either Bernardo Nerli or Giovanni Acciajuoli. These examples\r\nof printed publications belong, however, to a later chapter. Ficino\r\nfollowed up his translation of Plato’s work with a _Life of Plato_, and\r\nan essay on the _Platonic Doctrine of Immortality_.\r\n\r\nIn 1484, appeared in the Florentine circle the beautiful and brilliant\r\nPico della Mirandola, a man who through his exceptional gifts, his\r\nvaried learning, and the charm of his personality, exercised a very\r\nwide influence over his generation, and who may possibly be accepted\r\nas at once the type and the flower of the Renaissance. Pico studied\r\nat Bologna, and later at Paris. He printed, in 1489, in defence of\r\nhis philosophical theories, certain theses which were condemned as\r\nheretical by Innocent VIII. In 1493, the ban of heterodoxy was renewed\r\nby a brief of Alexander VI. Pico’s enquiring mind and scholarly ardour\r\ncovered a wide range of research, including the philosophy of the\r\nPlatonists, the mysteries of the Cabbala, and the system and theories\r\nof Aquinas, Scotus, Albertus Magnus, and Averrhoes, and he proposed to\r\ndevote his learning and his life to the task of reconciling classical\r\ntraditions with the Christian creeds. Didot quotes the following\r\ncharacteristic sentence from a letter written by Pico, February 11,\r\n1491, to Aldus Manutius: “_Philosophia veritatem quærit, theologia\r\ninvenit, religio possidet_.” (Philosophy seeks truth, theology\r\ndiscovers it, religion possesses it.)\r\n\r\nPico died at the age of thirty-one, before the book had been written in\r\nwhich he proposed to demonstrate these positions. He was able, however,\r\nto render a great service to Italy and to Europe in securing for his\r\nfriend Aldus the aid required for the establishment of the Aldine Press\r\nin Venice. The details of the relations of the two men are given in the\r\nchapter on Aldus.\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy members of the literary circle which surrounded\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, were Christoforo Landino, Leo Battista Alberti, and\r\nAngelo Poliziano. Landino edited _Horace_ and _Virgil_ and translated\r\nPliny’s _Natural History_, and in 1481 published an edition of _Dante_,\r\nand Battista Alberti, (whose comedy of _Philodoxius_, which passed for\r\nan antique, was published by the Aldi, in 1588, as the work of Lepidus\r\nComicus), wrote three treatises on painting, and several volumes on\r\narchitecture. Alberti was more distinguished as an artist, architect,\r\nand musician, than as an author. It was characteristic, however, of the\r\nmen of this group to be universal in their genius.\r\n\r\nSymonds speaks of Poliziano as emphatically the representative of\r\nthe highest achievements of the age in scholarship, and as the first\r\nItalian to combine perfect mastery over Latin and a correct sense of\r\nGreek, with splendid genius for his native literature. His published\r\nworks included annotated editions of _Ovid_, _Suetonius_, _Statius_,\r\n_Pliny_, and _Quintilian_, translations of _Epictetus_, _Galen_,\r\nand _Hippocrates_, a series of _Miscellanea_, and most important of\r\nall, the edition, printed from the famous Amalfi manuscript, of the\r\n_Pandects_ of Justinian.\r\n\r\nAmong the smaller cities in which the Humanistic movement influenced\r\nliterature and furthered the development of learning, may be mentioned\r\nCarpi, afterwards the home of Musurus and Aldus; Mirandola, the\r\nbirthplace of the brilliant Pico; Pesaro, where Alessandro and\r\nConstanzo Sforza brought together a library rivalling that of the\r\nMedici; Rimini, where Sigismondo Malatesta gathered about his fortress\r\na circle of scholars; and Urbino, where the good Duke Frederick brought\r\ntogether one of the finest collections of manuscripts which Europe\r\nhad known, a collection valued at over 30,000 ducats. Vespasiano, who\r\nserved for some time as librarian, says that for fourteen years the\r\nDuke kept from thirty to forty copyists employed in transcribing Greek\r\nand Latin Manuscripts. The work of these copyists went on for some\r\nyears after the introduction of printing into Italy, for Frederick, in\r\ncommon with not a few other of the scholarly nobles who were collectors\r\nof manuscripts, distrusted and looked down upon the new art, and had no\r\ninterest in books which were merely mechanical reproductions.\r\n\r\nVespasiano da Bisticci, whose aid Frederick had secured in the\r\npreparation of his library, was noted as an author, as a scribe, and as\r\na bookseller. Symonds speaks of the “rare merit” of the biographical\r\nwork in Vespasiano’s _Lives of Illustrious Men_, the memoirs of which\r\nSymonds utilised largely in the preparation of his _Renaissance_.\r\nVespasiano’s literary work must have been done “in the intervals of\r\nbusiness,” for his business undertakings were important. He was the\r\nlargest dealer in manuscripts of his time. His purchasing agents and\r\ncorrespondents were armed with instructions to secure authenticated\r\ncodices wherever these were obtainable, and the monasteries not only\r\nof Italy but of Switzerland, South Germany, Hungary, Transylvania, and\r\nthe East were carefully searched for possible literary treasures. He\r\nemployed a large force of skilled copyists in the production of copies\r\nof famous works, which copies were distributed through correspondents\r\nand customers in the different scholarly centres of Europe. Possessing\r\nhimself a wide and exact scholarship, he gave his personal attention\r\nto the selection of his texts, the training of his copyists and the\r\nsupervision of their work, so that a manuscript coming from Vespasiano\r\ncarried with it the prestige of accuracy and completeness.\r\n\r\nVespasiano’s scholarly knowledge and his special experience in\r\npalæography were utilised by such clients as Nicholas V., Cosimo de’\r\nMedici, Frederick of Urbino, and other lovers of literature, in the\r\nformation of and development of their libraries. Vespasiano united,\r\ntherefore, the functions of a scholarly editor and commentator, a\r\ncollector, a book-manufacturer, a publisher and a bookseller, a\r\nseries of responsibilities which called for a wide range of learning,\r\naccomplishments, and executive ability. It is evident from his career\r\nand from the testimony of his friends and clients (terms in this case\r\npractically identical) that he was devoted to literature for its own\r\nsake. He accepted the rewards secured by his skill and enterprise,\r\nand promptly expended these in fresh efforts for the development\r\nand extension of liberal scholarship. Vespasiano may be called the\r\nlast, as he was probably the greatest of the book-dealers of the\r\nmanuscript period. Born in 1421 and living until 1498, he witnessed\r\nthe introduction of printing into Italy, and may easily have had\r\nopportunities of handling the earlier productions of the Venetian\r\nprinting-press. Vespasiano was a fitting successor of Atticus and a\r\nworthy precursor of Aldus, whose work in the distribution of scholarly\r\nliterature was, in fact, a direct continuation of his own.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the trade in the production of manuscript copies\r\nwent on for a number of years after the introduction of printing. The\r\nnoblemen and wealthy scholars who had inherited, or who had themselves\r\nbrought together, collections of famous works in manuscript, were for\r\nsome time, not unnaturally, unwilling to believe that ordinary people\r\ncould, by means of the new invention, with a comparatively trifling\r\nexpenditure secure perfect and beautiful copies of the same works.\r\nBefore the death of Vespasiano, in 1498, however, the work of the\r\nprinting-press had come to be understood and cordially appreciated by\r\nbook-buyers and students of all classes, and the trade of the copyists\r\nand of the manuscript-dealers had, excepting for newly discovered\r\ntexts, practically come to an end. The career of Vespasiano belongs\r\nstrictly to the chapter on the publishers of manuscripts, of whom he\r\nwas the most important. The man himself, however, through his character\r\nand services, belongs essentially to the movement of the Renaissance,\r\nof which movement he was at once a product and a leader.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of Pope Innocent VIII., 1484-1492, and of Alexander\r\nVI. (Borgia), 1492-1503, little or nothing was done in Rome to\r\nfurther the development of literature. To the latter was in fact\r\ndue the initiating of the system of the subjection of the press to\r\necclesiastical censorship, a system which for centuries to come was to\r\nexercise the most baneful influence over literature and intellectual\r\nactivities and to interfere enormously with the establishment of any\r\nassured foundation for property in literature. Some account of the long\r\ncontests carried on by the publishers of Venice against this claim for\r\necclesiastical control of the productions of their presses, is given in\r\na later chapter.\r\n\r\nVenice stood almost alone among the cities of Italy in resisting the\r\ncensorship of the Church, and even in Venice, the Church in the end\r\nsucceeded in the more important of its contentions. In Spain, the\r\necclesiastical control was hardly questioned. In France, it was, after\r\na century of contest, practically merged in the censorship exercised\r\nby the Crown, a control which was in itself fully as much as the\r\npublishing trade could bear and continue to exist. In Austria and South\r\nGermany, after the crushing out of the various reformation movements,\r\nthe Church and State worked in practical accord in keeping a close\r\nsupervision of the printing-presses. In North Germany, on the other\r\nhand, ecclesiastical censorship never became important. The evils\r\nproduced by it were, however, serious and long enduring throughout a\r\nlarge portion of the territory of Europe, and the papal Borgia, though\r\nby no means a considerable personage, is responsible for bringing\r\ninto existence an evil which assumed enormous proportions in the\r\nintellectual history of Europe.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the fifteenth century begins in Italy the age of\r\nacademies, associations of scholars and littérateurs for the furthering\r\nof scholarly pursuits and of literary undertakings. One of the earlier\r\nof these Academies was instituted in Rome, in 1468, by Julius Pomponius\r\nLætus (a pupil of Valla), for the special purpose of promoting the\r\nstudy of Latin literature and Latin antiquities. Comedies of Plautus\r\nand of other Latin dramatists were revived, and the attempt was made to\r\nmake Latin, at least for the scholarly circle, again a living language.\r\nThe Academy was suspected by Pope Paul II. to have some political\r\npurpose, and it was for a time suppressed, but resumed its activities\r\nsome years later under the papacy of Alexander VI.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Naples was instituted in 1470, under the leadership of\r\nBeccadelli and Juvianus Pontanus, and with a membership comprising a\r\nnumber of the brilliant scholars whom Alphonso the Magnanimous had\r\nattracted to his Court. This society also devoted itself particularly\r\nto the revival of an interest in Latin literature, and not a few of the\r\nmembers became better known under the Latinised names there adopted by\r\nthem than by their Italian cognomens. Pomponius had written little and\r\nhoped to be remembered through his pupils. Pontanus on the other hand,\r\nwrote on many subjects, using for the purpose Latin, of which he was\r\na master. Symonds says that he chiefly deserves to be remembered for\r\nhis ethical treatises, but he seems himself to have attached special\r\nimportance to his amatory elegiacs and to a series of astronomical\r\nhexameters entitled _Urania_.\r\n\r\nIn Florence, the Platonic Academy continued to flourish under the\r\nauspices of the Rucellai family. It was suppressed in 1522, at the\r\ntime of the conspiracy against Giulio de’ Medici, but again revived\r\nin 1540. In 1572, was organised in Florence the famous academy called\r\n_Della Crusca_, which secured for itself a European reputation. In\r\nBologna, in 1504, the society of the _Viridario_ was instituted,\r\nwith the purpose of studying printed texts and of furthering the art\r\nof printing. Bologna had a considerable number of other literary\r\nsocieties, for the study of jurisprudence, chivalry, and other\r\nsubjects. Throughout Italy at this period academies multiplied, but the\r\ngreater number exercised no continued influence.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that they all proved of service in preparing\r\nthe way for the printed literature which the Italian presses were,\r\nafter 1490, beginning to distribute, and that in widening the range of\r\npopular interest in scholarship and in books generally, they did not\r\na little to render possible the work of Aldus and other early Italian\r\npublishers. The academy founded by Aldus in Venice, for the prosecution\r\nof Greek studies, will be referred to in the chapter on Aldus.\r\n\r\n“The fifteenth century rediscovered antiquity; the sixteenth was\r\nabsorbed in slowly deciphering it. In the fifteenth century ‘educated\r\nEurope’ is but a synonym for Italy. What literature there was north\r\nof the Alps was in great part derived from, or was largely dependent\r\nupon, the Italian movement. The fact that the movement originated\r\nin the Latin peninsula, was decisive of the character of the first\r\nage of classical learning (1400-1550). It was a revival of Latin as\r\nopposed to Greek literature. It is now well understood that the fall\r\nof Constantinople, though an influential incident of the movement,\r\nranks for little among the causes of the Renaissance. What was revived\r\nin Italy in the fifteenth century was the interest of the Schools\r\nof the early Empire--of the second and third century.... But in one\r\ndecisive feature, the literary sentiment of the fifteenth century was a\r\nreproduction of that of the Empire. It was rhetorical, not scientific.\r\nLatin literature as a whole is rhetorical.... The divorce of the\r\nliterature of knowledge and the literature of form which characterised\r\nthe epoch of decay under the early empire, characterised equally\r\nthe epoch of revival in the Italy of the Popes.... The knowledge and\r\nwisdom buried in the Greek writers presented a striking contrast to the\r\nbarren sophistic which formed the curriculum of the Latin schools. It\r\nbecame the task of the scholars of the second period of the classical\r\nrevival to disinter this knowledge.... Philology had meant composition\r\nand verbal emendation; it now meant the apprehension of the ideas\r\nand usages of the ancient world. Scholars had exerted themselves to\r\nwrite, they now bent all their effort to know.... There came now into\r\nexistence what has ever since been known as ‘learning,’ in the special\r\nsense of the term. The first period of humanism in which the words of\r\nthe ancient authors had been studied, was thus the preparatory school\r\nfor the humanism of the second period, in which the matter was the\r\nobject of attention.\r\n\r\nAs Italy had been the home of classical taste in the first period,\r\nFrance became the home of classical learning in the second. Single\r\nnames can be mentioned, such as Victorius or Sigonius in Italy,\r\nMursius or Vulcanius in the Low Countries, who were distinguished\r\nrepresentatives of ‘learning,’ but in Bulæus, Turnebus, Lambrinus,\r\nScaliger, Casaubon, and Saumaise, France produced a constellation of\r\nhumanists whose fame justly eclipsed that of all their contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIf we ask why Italy did not continue to be the centre of the humanist\r\nmovement, which she had so brilliantly inaugurated, the answer is that\r\nthe intelligence was crushed by the reviviscence of ecclesiastical\r\nideas. Learning is the result of research, and research must be free\r\nand cannot coexist with the claim of the Catholic clergy to be superior\r\nto enquiry. The French school, it will be observed, is wholly in fact\r\nor in intention Protestant. As soon as it was decided (as it was before\r\n1600) that France was to be a Catholic country, and the University of\r\nParis a Catholic university, learning was extinguished in France.\r\nFrance saw without regret and without repentance the expatriation\r\nof her unrivalled scholars. With Scaliger and Saumaise, the seat of\r\nlearning was transferred from France to Holland. The third period of\r\nclassical learning thus coincides with the Dutch school. From 1593, the\r\ndate of Scaliger’s removal to Leyden, the supremacy in the republic of\r\nlearning was possessed by the Dutch. In the course of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the Dutch school was gradually supplanted by the North German,\r\nwhich from that time forward has taken, and still possesses, the lead\r\nin philological science.”[420]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND THE WORK OF THE FIRST PRINTERS OF HOLLAND\r\nAND GERMANY.\r\n\r\n1440-1528.\r\n\r\n\r\n“FOUR men, Gutenberg, Columbus, Luther, and Copernicus, stand at\r\nthe dividing line of the Middle Ages, and serve as boundary stones\r\nmarking the entrance of mankind into a higher and finer epoch of its\r\ndevelopment.”[421]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say which one of the four has made the\r\nlargest contribution to this development or has done the most to\r\nlift up the spirit of mankind and to open for men the doors to the\r\nnew realms that were in readiness. The Genoese seaman and discoverer\r\nopens new realms to our knowledge and imagination, leads Europe from\r\nthe narrow restrictions of the Middle Ages out into the vast space of\r\nWestern oceans, and in adding to the material realms controlled by\r\ncivilisation, widens still more largely the range of its thought and\r\nfancy. The Reformer of Wittenberg, in breaking the bonds which had\r\nchained the spirits of his fellow-men and in securing for them again\r\ntheir rights as individual Christians, conquers for them a spiritual\r\nrealm and brings them into renewed relations with their Creator. The\r\ngreat astronomer shatters, through his discoveries, the fixed and petty\r\nconceptions of the universe which had ruled the minds of mankind, and\r\nin bringing to them fresh light on the nature and extent of created\r\nthings, widens at the same time their whole understanding of themselves\r\nand of duty. The citizen of Mayence may claim to have unchained\r\nintelligence and given to it wings. He utilised lead no longer as a\r\ndeath-bringing ball, but in the form of life-quickening letters which\r\nwere to bring before thousands of minds the teachings of the world’s\r\nthinkers. Each one of the four had his part in bringing to the world\r\nlight, knowledge, and development.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the art of printing finally took shape in the mind\r\nof Gutenberg, the direction of literary and intellectual interests\r\nof Germany rested, as we have seen, largely with Italy. The fact,\r\nhowever, that the new art had its birthplace, not in Florence, which\r\nwas at that time the centre of the literary activities of Europe, but\r\nin Mayence, heretofore a town which had hardly been connected at all\r\nwith literature, and the further fact that the printing-presses were\r\ncarrying on their work in Germany for nearly fifteen years before\r\ntwo printers, themselves Germans, set up the first press in Italy,\r\nexercised, of necessity, an important influence in inciting literary\r\nactivities throughout Germany and in the relations borne by Germany to\r\nthe scholarship of the world.\r\n\r\nThe details of the life and early work of Gutenberg are at best\r\nbut fragmentary, and have been a subject of much discussion. It is\r\nnot necessary, for the purpose of this treatise, to give detailed\r\nconsideration to the long series of controversies as to the respective\r\nclaims of Gutenberg of Mayence, of Koster of Haarlem, or of other\r\ncompetitors, as to the measure of credit to be assigned to each in\r\nthe original discovery or of the practical development of the the\r\nprinting-press. It seems in any case evident that whatever minds\r\nelsewhere were at that time puzzling over the same problem, it was the\r\ngood fortune of Gutenberg to make the first practical application of\r\nthe printing-press to the production of impressions from movable type,\r\nwhile it was certainly from Mayence that the art spread throughout the\r\ncities, first of Germany, and later of Italy and France.\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind (and I speak here for the non-technical\r\nreader) that, as indicated in the above reference, the distinction and\r\nimportant part of the invention of Gutenberg was, not the production of\r\na press for the multiplication of impressions, but the use of movable\r\ntype and the preparation of the form from which the impressions were\r\nstruck off. The art of printing from blocks, since classified as\r\nxylographic printing, had been practised in certain quarters of Europe\r\nfor fifty years or more before the time of Gutenberg, and if Europe had\r\nhad communication with China, xylography might have been introduced\r\nfour or five centuries earlier.\r\n\r\nWith the block-books, the essential thing was the illustrations, and\r\nwhat text or letterpress accompanied these was usually limited to a\r\nfew explanatory or descriptive words engraved on the block, above,\r\nbeneath or around the picture. Occasionally, however, as in the _Ars\r\nMoriendi_, there were entire pages of text engraved, like the designs,\r\non the solid block. The earlier engraving was done on hard wood, but,\r\nlater, copper was also employed. It is probable that the block-books\r\noriginated in the Netherlands, and it is certain that in such towns\r\nas Bruges, Antwerp, and Amsterdam, the art was developed more rapidly\r\nthan elsewhere, so that during the first half of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe production of wood engravings and of books made up of engravings\r\n(printed only on one side, and accompanied by a few words of text),\r\nbegan to form an important article of trade. The subjects of these\r\ndesigns were for the most part Biblical, or at least religious. One\r\nof the earlier of the block-book publications and probably the most\r\ncharacteristic specimen of the class, is the volume known as the\r\n_Biblia Pauperum_. This was a close imitation of a manuscript book\r\nthat had for five or six centuries been popular as a work of religious\r\ninstruction. It had been composed about 850, by S. Ausgarius, a monk\r\nof Corbie, who afterwards became Bishop of Hamburg. The _scriptorium_\r\nestablished by him at Corbie was said to have been the means of\r\npreserving from destruction a number of classics, including the\r\n_Annals_ of Tacitus.[422] The use, five centuries later, as one of the\r\nfirst productions of the printing-press, of the monk’s own composition,\r\nmay be considered as a fitting acknowledgement of the service thus\r\nrendered by him to the world’s literature. Examples of manuscript\r\ncopies of the _Biblia Pauperum_ are in existence in the _Bibliothèque\r\nNationale_ in Paris, in Munich, in the British Museum, and elsewhere,\r\nand there is no difficulty in comparing these with the printed copies\r\nproduced in the Netherlands, which are also represented in these\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Laurence Koster of Haarlem, whose name is, later,\r\nassociated with printing from movable type, was himself an engraver of\r\nblock-books. Humphreys is, in fact, inclined to believe that the first\r\nblock-book edition of the _Biblia Pauperum_ was actually Koster’s work,\r\nbasing this opinion on the similarity of the compositions and of their\r\narrangement to those of the _Speculum Humanæ Salvationis_, which was\r\nthe first work printed from movable type, and the production of which\r\nis now generally credited to Koster.[423] The _Biblia Pauperum_ was\r\nprinted from blocks in Germany as late as 1475, but before that date an\r\nedition had been printed from movable type by Pfister in Bamberg.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out by many of the writers on the subject, the\r\nso-called invention of printing was not so much the result of an\r\nindividual inspiration, as the almost inevitable consequence of a long\r\nseries of experiments and of partial processes which had been conducted\r\nin various places where the community was interesting itself in the\r\nmultiplication of literature.\r\n\r\nIf, as is probably the case, the first book printed from movable type\r\nis to be credited to Koster, it remains none the less the case that\r\nGutenberg’s process must have been worked out for itself, and that the\r\nGerman possessed, what the Hollander appears to have lacked, not merely\r\nthe persistence and the practical understanding required to produce\r\na single book, but the power to overcome obstacles and to instruct\r\nothers, and was thus able to establish the new art on a lasting\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the Hollanders under which Koster is to be regarded as\r\nthe first printer, or at least (bearing in mind the Chinese precedents\r\nin the tenth century) the first European printer, from movable type,\r\nclaims which Humphreys accepts as well founded, are in substance as\r\nfollows: Laurence Koster was born, somewhere in Holland, about 1370,\r\nand died in Haarlem about 1440. He is believed to have made his first\r\nexperiments with movable wooden types about 1426, and to have worked\r\nwith metal types about ten years later. The principal of the earlier\r\nauthorities concerning Koster’s career is a certain Hadrian Junius, who\r\ncompleted, in 1569, a history of Holland, which was published in 1588.\r\nHe speaks of Koster as being a man of an honourable family, in which\r\nthe office of Sacristan (custos, Coster or Koster) was hereditary,\r\nand he describes in detail the development of the invention of type,\r\nfrom the cutting of pieces of beech-bark into the form of letters, to\r\nthe final production of the metal fonts. Junius goes on to relate the\r\nmethod under which Koster’s first book (from type), _Speculum Humanæ\r\nSalvationis_, was printed, in 1430. This book, the origin of which is\r\nnot known, had for many years been popular among the Benedictines,\r\nand few of their monasteries were without a copy. As a result of\r\nthis popularity, many examples of the manuscript copies have been\r\npreserved, some of which are in the Arundel collection in the British\r\nMuseum. Zani says that the _Speculum_ was compiled for the assistance\r\nof poor preachers, and in support of this view he quotes certain lines,\r\nwhich may serve also as an example of Latinity and of the general style:\r\n\r\n  _Predictum prohemium hujus libri de contentis compilavi\r\n  Et propter pauperes predicatores hoc opponere curavi._[424]\r\n\r\nKoster appears to have produced, about 1428, an edition of a portion\r\nof the _Speculum_ in which the entire pages (presenting on the upper\r\nhalf two designs, and on the lower two columns of text) are printed\r\nfrom solid wooden blocks. Humphreys gives examples of these pages. The\r\ncutting of the text, all the letters of which had, of course, to be cut\r\nin reverse, is a wonderful piece of work. About 1430, was completed the\r\nfirst issue printed from movable types. The arrangement of the pages\r\nis the same, the upper half is occupied with two designs (printed in\r\nbrown ink, from wooden blocks), and the lower half is given to the\r\ntext, printed in black ink, from the metal type. The first typographic\r\nedition contains a number of xylographic pages. In the type-pages, the\r\nblock-illustration was printed first, and the sheet was then imposed\r\nagain for the printing of the text. Both the designs and the text were\r\nmodelled to follow very closely the character of the manuscripts of\r\nthe period. The volume is undoubtedly the earliest European example of\r\nprinting from type, and the evidence that it was the work of Koster,\r\nand that it was produced not later than 1430, or about twenty years\r\nearlier than the Bible of Gutenberg, is, I understand, now accepted by\r\nthe best authorities as practically conclusive. Three editions of the\r\nbook were printed by Koster before his death in 1440, the third being\r\nprinted in Dutch (instead of Latin), and being entirely typographic.\r\nThis is the edition seen and described (128 years later) by Junius.\r\nAfter specifying the method employed by Koster (according to his own\r\nviews concerning movable type), Junius goes on to say, “It was by this\r\nmethod that he produced impressions of engraved plates, to which he\r\nadded ‘separate’ letters. I have seen a book of this kind, the first\r\nrude effort of his invention, printed by him on one side only; this\r\nbook was entitled the _Mirror of Our Salvation_.” While this evidence\r\nof Junius comes first into record one hundred and twenty-eight years\r\nafter the time assigned to the printing of Koster’s first book, it is\r\nthe conclusion of Humphreys, Blades, and other historians that, in\r\nconsideration of the circumstances under which Junius wrote, and the\r\nnature of the information which was evidently at that time available\r\nfor him, his testimony may safely be accepted as conclusive. Junius\r\ngoes on to say that Koster, having perfected his system, and finding\r\na rapidly increasing demand for his printed books, was unable to\r\nmanage the work with the aid of the members of his own family. He\r\ntook foreign workmen into his employ, which eventually led to the\r\nabstraction of his secret and caused the credit of his invention to\r\nbe given to others.[425] Junius gives further details concerning the\r\nchannels through which he secured the record of the work of Koster. He\r\nrefers to a certain Nicholas Galius who had been his first preceptor,\r\nand who remembered having heard the facts connected with Koster’s\r\ndiscovery from a certain Cornelius when the latter was over eighty\r\nyears of age. Cornelius testified that he had himself been a binder\r\nin the establishment of Koster, and the Dutch historian, Meerman, has\r\ndiscovered in the records of the church of Haarlem a memorandum dated\r\n1474, which is evidence that there was at that date a binder in the\r\ntown called Cornelius.[426]\r\n\r\nIn claiming for Holland the prestige of inventing the several\r\ndistinctive processes connected with the printing of books, Humphreys\r\nsums up as follows: It is beyond dispute that the Dutch were the first\r\nto produce block-books, and thus were virtually the first printers\r\nof books. It is also a matter of record that it was the printers of\r\nHolland who first devised the art of stereotyping, a process which\r\nwas applied by John Miller of Amsterdam towards the close of the\r\nseventeenth century. There is, therefore, apart from the details\r\nabove specified and from the evidence of tradition, a strong natural\r\npresumption in favour of the development in Holland of the intervening\r\nstep of substituting movable types for carved pages of letters.\r\nHumphreys points out that there are other references to the production\r\nin the Netherlands of books from movable metal types, before the date\r\nat which Gutenberg’s first volume was completed in Mayence. In a\r\nrecord of accounts of Jean Robert, Abbé of Cambrai, the manuscript of\r\nwhich has been preserved in the archives of the city of Lille, appears\r\nthe entry: “Item, for a printed (_getté en molle_) _Doctrinal_ that\r\nI sent for to Bruges by Macquart, who is a writer at Valenciennes,\r\nin the month of January, 1445, for Jacquet, twenty sous, Tournois.\r\nLittle Alexander had one the same, that the church paid for.” It is\r\nstated later in the record that one of these books proved to be so\r\n“full of faults” that it had to be replaced by a written copy.[427]\r\nThe purport of the term _getté en molle_ (which might possibly have\r\nbeen written _jetté_ or _guetté_) was first elucidated by M. Besuard,\r\nwho pointed out that it evidently stood for “cast in a mould,” the\r\nreference being to the metallic types, which were so cast. In the\r\nletters of naturalisation accorded, in 1474, to the first printers with\r\nmovable types established in Paris, the term used is _escritoire en\r\nmolle_, or writing by means of moulds or moulded letters. Humphreys is\r\ninclined to give credit to the theory, which is presented by many of\r\nthe advocates of Koster, that the first suggestion of the new art was\r\nbrought to Gutenberg in Strasburg by a workman who had been employed\r\nby Koster in Haarlem, but he admits that this theory is supported by\r\npractically nothing that can be called evidence, and depends for its\r\nauthority simply upon the sequence of events, and upon the surmises\r\nand probabilities suggested by Junius. It remains the case that after\r\nthe death of Koster, which occurred either in 1440 or in 1439, the\r\nproduction of books from type came to an end in Holland, and that for\r\ninstruction in the new art Europe was indebted not to Haarlem but to\r\nMayence. We may accept as conclusive the evidence which gives to Koster\r\nthe credit of producing the first book printed (outside of China) from\r\nmovable type, without lessening the value of the service rendered by\r\nGutenberg. The shores of our Western Continent were undoubtedly visited\r\nby Eric and his Northmen, but it was Columbus who gave to Europe the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nThe production of printed books, which changed the whole condition of\r\nliterary production and of literary ownership, is to be traced directly\r\nto the operations of Gutenberg and Fust. Kapp mentions that if it were\r\nnot for the records of certain court processes of Strasburg and of\r\nMayence, we should have hardly any trustworthy references whatsoever to\r\nthe work or the relations of Gutenberg prior to 1450.\r\n\r\nBy means of these court records, however, it has proved possible to\r\nsecure some data concerning various undertakings in which Gutenberg was\r\nengaged before he devoted himself to his printing-office. He belonged\r\nto a noble family of Mayence, the family name of which was originally\r\nGensfleisch, a name Latinised by some writers of the time as Ansicarus.\r\nFor more than a century, the Gensfleische stood at the head of the\r\nnobility of the city in the long series of contests carried on with\r\nthe guilds and citizens.\r\n\r\nUntil the sacking of the city, after the outbreak of October,\r\n1462, Mayence was the most important of the free cities and of the\r\ncommercial centres of the middle Rhine district, and was an important\r\ncompetitor for the general trade of central Europe with Strasburg on\r\nthe upper river and with Cologne in the region below. The citizens\r\nfelt themselves strong enough, with the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, to make a sturdy fight against the old-time control claimed by\r\nthe nobility, and as early as 1420, they had overcome the patricians\r\nin a contest which turned upon the reception of the newly chosen\r\nElector, Conrad III. As one result of this struggle, a number of the\r\nGensfleische found themselves among the exiles.\r\n\r\nGutenberg’s father, whose name was Frilo, had held the office of Tax\r\nReceiver or General Accountant in the city, and was among those who\r\nwere banished in 1420. Gutenberg himself was born either in 1397\r\nor 1398. He appears to have passed a portion of his youth at the\r\nlittle village of Eltville, and from there went to Strasburg. In the\r\nyear 1433, an entry in the tax record of Mayence speaks of Henne\r\nGensfleisch, called Gutenberg, who was an uncle of the printer. About\r\nthe year 1440, Gutenberg was engaged in Strasburg in the manufacture\r\nof looking-glasses, and is already referred to as a man of scientific\r\nattainments and learned in inventions.\r\n\r\nOne of the court records above referred to gives the details of a suit\r\nbrought by the brothers Dritzehn against Gutenberg, in connection with\r\nthis first manufacturing business. Another Dritzehn, a brother or a\r\ncousin of the above, had as early as 1437 applied to Gutenberg to\r\nbe instructed (in consideration of the payment of an honorarium) in\r\na “certain art” (_in etlicher kunst_). Shortly thereafter Gutenberg\r\nentered into an arrangement with a certain Hans Riffe of Lichtenau,\r\nand instructed him in the trade of manufacturing mirrors, Riffe making\r\nan investment in the business and sharing the profits.\r\n\r\nDritzehn made in all, three contracts with Gutenberg; under the first,\r\nhe was instructed in the art of stone-polishing, and took some interest\r\nin this branch of Gutenberg’s business; under the second, he interested\r\nhimself in the manufacturing of mirrors; while the third contract\r\nrefers to certain arts and undertakings (_kunste und afentur_) in which\r\nDritzehn also received instruction, and to the carrying on of which he\r\nalso contributed an investment.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of some of the students on the subject that the\r\nresearches of Gutenberg, which resulted in 1450 in the production of a\r\nworking printing-press, had begun at least ten years back, and that, in\r\nconnection with these researches, he had been obliged to borrow money\r\nor to accept investments from Dritzehn and from other associates. The\r\nvague terms used in referring to the undertakings which were associated\r\nwith or which followed the mirror manufacturing business (“a certain\r\nart”) indicate that these associates had been cautioned to give no\r\ninformation as to the precise nature of the work in which Gutenberg\r\nwas experimenting. Humphreys is of opinion that the term “manufacture\r\nof looking-glasses” was used partly as a blind and partly as a joke,\r\nand that Gutenberg was actually engaged in the production (with\r\nthe aid of one of Koster’s assistants) of copies of the _Speculum_\r\n(Mirror). Against this view is the fact that Gutenberg did not print\r\nthe _Speculum_ at all. If Gutenberg were already working over the\r\nprinting-press invention at the time of his association with Dritzehn\r\nand with Riffe, there may be some justice in the claim of Strasburg to\r\nbe the birthplace of the printing-press. The completed press, however,\r\nwas not produced until Gutenberg had returned to the old home city of\r\nthe family--Mayence.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the suit brought by Dritzehn against Gutenberg,\r\nthat is to say, after 1440, there are no further references to\r\nGutenberg’s undertakings in Strasburg. It is not even known whether\r\nor not he continued business operations there, but it appears that he\r\nwas dwelling there as late as 1444. In 1448, he is recorded as again a\r\ncitizen of Mayence, and it was in Mayence that, in 1450, the completed\r\ninvention became known to the world.\r\n\r\nGutenberg’s name stands on no title-page and is connected with no\r\ncolophon. The fact, however, that the full responsibility for the\r\ninvention belongs to him is borne witness to by his contemporaries,\r\nPeter Schöffer, Ulrich Zell, the Abbot Trithemius, Jacob Wimpheling,\r\nand others. In a chronicle of the archbishop of Mayence, continued to\r\nthe year 1555 and compiled by Count Wilhelm von Zimmern, it is recorded\r\nthat the noble art of book-printing was discovered in Mayence by a\r\nworthy citizen named Gutenberg, who devoted to the invention all his\r\ntime and resources until he had brought it to a successful completion.\r\n\r\nIn 1470, a letter was written by the scholar, Wilhelm Fichet, of Paris,\r\nto the historian, Robert Gaguin, which letter was later printed on\r\nthe last sheet of a volume published in Paris and in Basel, entitled:\r\n_Gasparini Pergamensis Orthographiæ Liber_. This letter contains an\r\nenthusiastic description of the new art of book-printing discovered in\r\nGermany by Gutenberg. The writer says: “There has been discovered in\r\nGermany a wonderful new method for the production of books, and those\r\nwho have mastered this method are taking their invention from Mayence\r\nout into the world somewhat as the old Grecian warriors took their\r\nweapons from the belly of the Trojan horse. The light of this wonderful\r\ndiscovery will spread from Germany to all parts of the earth. I have\r\nbeen told by three foreigners--Kranz, Freiburger, and Gering--that\r\nGutenberg has succeeded in producing books by means of metal letters in\r\nplace of using the handiwork of the scribes.”\r\n\r\nFichet goes on to speak of Gutenberg as “bringing more blessings\r\nupon the world than were given by the goddess Ceres, for Ceres could\r\nbestow only material food, while through Gutenberg the productions of\r\nthe thinkers could be brought within the reach of all people.” This\r\nletter was written only two years after the death of Gutenberg, and\r\nas it came from Basel, one of the first cities to which the new art\r\nhad been carried from Mayence, it constitutes very good contemporary\r\nevidence as to the immediate credit that was given to Gutenberg for the\r\ninvention.[428]\r\n\r\nThe historical date now given for the completion of the invention is\r\nAugust 22, 1450. On this date Gutenberg entered into a contract with\r\nJohann Fust, a wealthy citizen and goldsmith of Mayence, under which\r\ncontract Fust loaned to Gutenberg, with interest at 6 per cent. (a\r\nlow rate for that period), the sum of 800 gulden in gold. This sum\r\nGutenberg agreed to utilise in developing his invention, while the\r\nmaterial of the workshop to be instituted was pledged to Fust as\r\nsecurity for the repayment of the loan. The sum proved insufficient\r\nfor establishing the necessary plant, and two years later Fust added a\r\nfurther sum of 800 gulden.\r\n\r\nGutenberg pledged himself, as afterwards stated in the lawsuit which\r\narose between Fust and himself, to use this money for the printing of\r\nbooks,--“_das werk der bücher_.” At the time Gutenberg secured this\r\nloan, it seemed evident that, in experimenting with and in developing\r\nhis invention, he had exhausted his own entire resources.\r\n\r\nGutenberg could, of course, lay no claim to being in any literal sense\r\nof the term the first printer. Printing in one form or another had been\r\ncarried on in Germany and elsewhere for a number of years, and printing\r\nfrom movable blocks had, in fact, been done in China 400 years or more\r\nbefore the beginning of Gutenberg’s work. As early as the twelfth\r\ncentury, says Kapp, there are numerous references to cloth printers,\r\nstampers of letters, and printers of maps. The oldest wood-cut known to\r\nhave been produced in Europe, is a representation of S. Christopher,\r\nand bears date 1423. At about this time, and probably, in fact, some\r\nyears earlier, was begun in Holland, as previously stated, the work\r\nof printing from wooden blocks, the designs being principally devoted\r\nto holy subjects. In connection with such designs, there had been\r\nprinting also from letterings cut out of solid wooden blocks, and these\r\nletterings had even in some cases been cut upon blocks sufficient to\r\noccupy an entire page.\r\n\r\nThe practical contribution made by Gutenberg, which developed from the\r\neasy processes of stamping designs and brief lines of lettering, a\r\nmethod by means of which whole books could be produced, was first, in\r\nthe use of movable metal type, produced by casting, and second, in an\r\nimprovement made in the mechanism of the hand presses by which larger\r\nsheets could be worked.\r\n\r\nThe first work produced with this movable metal type was a Latin\r\nversion of the Bible. The description of this volume is first given in\r\na chronicle of Cologne, dating from the year 1499, the statements in\r\nwhich rest upon the authority of Ulrich Zell, who was the first printer\r\nin Cologne.\r\n\r\nConcerning the further operations of Gutenberg, we are mainly dependent\r\nupon the references in the records of the suit brought by Fust, in\r\n1445, for the repayment of his loan, and upon a document of 1468\r\nin which a certain Dr. Humery entered into an undertaking with the\r\nArchbishop of Mayence that the printing-office plant left by the\r\ndeceased Johann Gutenberg shall not be permitted to be taken out of\r\nthe city of Mayence. This later reference had to do with a second\r\nprinting-press established by Gutenberg with the aid of the said Humery.\r\n\r\nIn the suit brought by Fust, Gutenberg contended that the second\r\npayment of 800 gulden agreed upon had never been given to him in full.\r\nHe stated further that Fust had agreed to advance 300 gulden per year\r\nfor use in the purchase of materials, paper, parchment, type-metal, and\r\nink. The matter of the later accountings between Fust and Gutenberg is\r\nevidently a complicated one and need not be considered here in detail.\r\nGutenberg’s inability to repay the first and more important loan for\r\nthe payment of which his first printing-press had been mortgaged,\r\ncaused the ownership of this office to come into the control of Fust.\r\n\r\nFortunately, by the time his first venture had thus been closed, as\r\nfar at least as he was concerned, he had been able to give sufficient\r\nevidence of the importance and of the commercial value of the\r\nundertaking to be in a position to interest others in his schemes.\r\n\r\nHis second printing-press was in like manner pledged to the associate\r\nwho provided the capital,--Dr. Humery,--and the business of this\r\noffice appears to have been continued without break until the time\r\nof Gutenberg’s death in 1468. With these new resources at hand,\r\nGutenberg was able to cast some new fonts of type, and to make various\r\nimprovements in his working methods.\r\n\r\nThe first issues of the new press, the organisation of which appears to\r\nhave been completed about 1457, were volumes containing the writings\r\nof Mätthaus de Cracovia and Thomas Aquinas. The third book was the\r\nfamous first edition of the _Catholicon_, a grammatical compilation\r\nof the Dominican monk Balbus from Genoa. The _Catholicon_ was a folio\r\ncontaining no less than 373 rather closely printed sheets. In the\r\nmeantime, Fust had associated with him Schöffer or Schoiffher, who had\r\nbeen an assistant of Gutenberg, and the two were continuing work in the\r\noriginal printing-office.\r\n\r\nThe sacking of Mayence, in 1462, by Adolph of Nassau, put an end, for\r\nthe time, to all business in the city, including the work of the new\r\nprinting-presses. Gutenberg betook himself to the neighbouring town of\r\nEltville, which, as early as 1420, had given shelter to his parents,\r\nand there he carried on his printing for a time under the protection of\r\nArchbishop Adolph.\r\n\r\nKapp points out that the printing art had its development, not in a\r\nuniversity centre, but in a commercial town, and was from the outset\r\ncarried on, not by scholars, but by workers of the people, and that\r\nthis fact doubtless had an important influence in bringing the whole\r\nbusiness of the production of books and the distribution of literature\r\ninto closer relations with the mass of the German people than was the\r\ncase in France.\r\n\r\nIn France, as will be noted later, the first printers were directly\r\nassociated with the university, succeeding immediately to the official\r\nuniversity scribes, and the production of books through the presses\r\ncontinued to be under direct control of the university, as had been the\r\ncase from the beginning with the production of books in manuscript.\r\nThe fact that the control of the first French presses rested with the\r\nuniversity Faculty, undoubtedly exercised an important influence on\r\nthe choice of the books to be printed, and the first issues of the\r\nFrench presses were, therefore, in the main restricted to editions of\r\nthe classics or to works of jurisprudence and medicine belonging to\r\nthe official lists of the university texts. The earlier issues of the\r\nGerman press, on the other hand, were books belonging in no way to the\r\nuniversity _curriculum_, but were addressed directly to the interests\r\nof the people at large.\r\n\r\nWhile the modifications introduced by Gutenberg into the methods of\r\nprinting, under which the old engraved blocks were replaced by movable\r\nleaden type, seem slight in themselves, they constituted nevertheless a\r\nnew art. The actual changes were but inconsiderable, but the practical\r\nresult was a revolution in the possibilities of the press.\r\n\r\nGutenberg’s work as a printer was, from a commercial point of view,\r\nnever successful. During the eighteen years which elapsed between the\r\ntime of his invention and the date of his death, he seems to have been\r\nalways under the pressure of debt and money difficulties. He had in\r\nfact no time to make money. He had given up, in his devotion to his\r\ninvention, previous business undertakings which were remunerative,\r\nand he had absorbed in the development of the printing-press all the\r\nresources that he could control. His interest, however, was evidently\r\nthat of perfecting an art rather than of creating a business; and\r\nin spite of his various difficulties and his several lawsuits with\r\nhis associates, it is in evidence as part of the testimony in these\r\nvery suits, that he was recognised by all as a man of knowledge and\r\ncharacter, and as a born leader, whose integrity of purpose and whose\r\nnobility of aim were acknowledged by all with whom he had to do.\r\nWith all his misfortunes, he seems never for a moment to have lost\r\nconfidence in the value to the world of his idea, and to this idea,\r\nwith no thought of personal gain or advantage, he was willing to devote\r\nhis means and his life.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the production each year of a few hundred\r\ncopies of religious or classical works by the laborious toil of the\r\nmonks or the university scribes, works which could at best benefit\r\nonly the limited circle of readers who were within reach either of the\r\nmonasteries or of the universities, and a world-wide distribution, as\r\nwell of the great books of the earlier times which belonged to the\r\nworld’s literature as of the current thoughts of the contemporary\r\ngeneration, was a difference, not of degree, but of kind. It was a\r\nrevolution in the history of human thought and in the influence of\r\nthought upon humanity.\r\n\r\nIf the invention of printing had not taken shape in the brain of\r\nGutenberg, it would doubtless have come to the world through some\r\nother worker, and, in fact, with no very great delay, for other men\r\nwere already busying themselves with the same great need and were on\r\nthe track of the same means of supplying the need. As the history\r\nstands, however, the credit for the revolution must be given to the\r\nmirror-maker of Mayence. Other sailors would certainly have found\r\ntheir way to the Western Continent if the opportunity or the attempt\r\nof Columbus had failed, but it is to Columbus that history gives the\r\nlaurel crown.\r\n\r\nGutenberg, and the printers who followed him, naturally selected as the\r\nfirst models for their newly founded type the script letters with which\r\nthey were familiar in the best manuscripts. The first font of type\r\nmanufactured by Gutenberg, which was used in his earliest publication,\r\n_The Folio Bible_, was known as the “missal type,” having been copied\r\nfrom the script adopted by the monks for the books of worship. This\r\nstyle of type was followed for a long time for Bibles and for religious\r\nworks generally. One of the earlier objections against printed books\r\nwas that they were so much less beautiful in their appearance than the\r\nwork of the best scribes, and it was the finest script that remained\r\nas the ideal to be attained by the type-founders and the clear black\r\nimpression of the best oak-gall writing ink that was to be imitated by\r\nthe impressions from the presses.\r\n\r\nThe scholarly lovers of fine books in Germany regarded the new art at\r\nthe outset with no little disapproval and criticism. The collectors\r\nwho had brought together, with much labour and expenditure, stores\r\nof valuable manuscripts dreaded lest, through the multiplication of\r\ncomparatively inexpensive copies of their texts, the value of their\r\ncollections should be taken away. When the messengers of Cardinal\r\nBessarion were shown by the Greek Laskaris (later the author of the\r\nfirst Greek grammar that came into print), a specimen of one of the\r\nearlier printed books, they spoke sneeringly of this so-called\r\ndiscovery which had been made by a barbarian from a German city.[429]\r\nThe great manuscript-dealer, Vespasiano, writing in 1482 concerning\r\nthe magnificent ducal library in Urbino, the volumes in which had\r\nbeen largely either collected or purchased by himself or under his\r\nown direction, says: “In this library all the volumes are of perfect\r\nbeauty, all written, by skilled scribes, on parchment and many of\r\nthem adorned with exquisite miniatures. The collection contains no\r\nsingle printed book. The Duke (Frederick) would be ashamed to have a\r\nprinted book in his library.”[430] By collectors like Frederick and\r\nmanuscript-dealers like Vespasiano, the new art was considered to be\r\nmerely a mechanical method of producing inartistic volumes, with which\r\nnone but uncultivated people could be satisfied.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, therefore, after the work of the first presses,\r\nthere were still produced beautiful specimens of manuscripts, more\r\nparticularly of Italian and French books of worship, and for this class\r\nof manuscripts the work of the hand illuminators and miniature painters\r\ncontinued to be utilised. In Germany there are various examples of\r\nbooks which had been printed, being again produced in written copy, as\r\nfor instance, the _Chronicon Urspergense_, of Hroswitha.[431] It was\r\nalso the case that for the production of large choir-books the work of\r\nthe scribes continued to be useful.\r\n\r\nTrithemius, Abbot of Sponheim, wrote to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz, a\r\nletter which was printed in 1494 in Mayence, under the title, _De Laude\r\nScriptorum Manualium_. In this he says:\r\n\r\n“A work written on parchment could be preserved for a thousand years,\r\nwhile it is probable that no volume printed on paper will last for more\r\nthan two centuries. Many important works have not been printed, and the\r\ncopies required of these must be prepared by scribes. The scribe who\r\nceases his work because of the invention of the printing-press can be\r\nno true lover of books, in that, regarding only the present, he gives\r\nno due thought to the intellectual cultivation of his successors. The\r\nprinter has no care for the beauty and the artistic form of books,\r\nwhile with the scribe this is a labour of love.”[432]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such criticism on the part of a few scholarly\r\nchurchmen, the influence of Rome and of the Church generally, during\r\nthe earlier work of the printers, was very largely favourable and had\r\nnot a little to do with the support given to the work which might\r\neasily otherwise have been given up for lack of adequate business\r\nreturn. The Church of Rome felt itself at this time sufficiently secure\r\nin its control of the minds of men to be prepared to utilise to full\r\nadvantage all methods for distributing its doctrinal literature, and\r\nto have no dread as to these same means being used for the scattering\r\nof heretical teachings. The popes of the time, largely influenced by\r\nthe spirit of the Renaissance, gave a cordial welcome to the revival\r\nof scholarly interests and to the printing-press as an important\r\nmeans for furthering the general education and the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the community. Their interest was by no means limited\r\nto the distribution of doctrinal works, but in these earlier years of\r\npublishing they welcomed, and to a considerable extent co-operated in,\r\nthe production of editions, for general circulation, of the works of\r\nthe pagan classics.\r\n\r\nHegel says, in his _Philosophy of History_, that the renewed interest\r\nin the studying of the writings of the ancients found an important\r\nsupport in the service of the printing-press. He goes on to point out\r\nthat the Church felt no anxiety concerning this renewed interest in\r\npagan literature, and evidently did not imagine that this literature\r\nwas introducing into the minds of men a new element of suggestion and\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered as one of the fortunate circumstances attending\r\nthe introduction of the art of printing that the popes of the time were\r\nlargely men of liberal education and of intellectual tastes, while one\r\nor two, such as Nicholas V., Julius II., and Leo X., had a very keen\r\npersonal interest in literature and were collectors of books.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Leo X. was a luxury-loving, free-thinking prince rather\r\nthan a devoted Christian leader or teacher, may very probably have been\r\nin the end a service for the enlightenment and development of his own\r\ngeneration and of the generations that were to come. An earnest and\r\nnarrow-minded head of the Church could, during the first years of the\r\nsixteenth century, have retarded not a little the development of the\r\nwork of producing books for the community at large.\r\n\r\nIt was a number of years before the dread of the use of the\r\nprinting-press for the spread of heretical doctrines and of a\r\nconsequent undermining of the authority of the Church assumed such\r\nproportions in the minds of the popes in Rome and with the bishops\r\nelsewhere, as to cause the influence of the Church to be placed against\r\nthe interests of the world of literature. As a result of this early\r\nacceptance by the Church of the printing-press as a useful ally and\r\nservant, the first Italian presses were supported by bishops and\r\ncardinals in the work of producing classics for scholarly readers,\r\nwhile at the other extremity of the Church organisation, and at a\r\ndistance of a thousand miles or more from Rome, the Brothers of\r\nCommon Life were using the presses in their Brotherhood homes for the\r\ndistribution of cheap books among the people.\r\n\r\nBerthold von Henneberg, Elector of Mayence, speaks of “The Divine Art\r\nof Printing.”[433] The Carthusian monk, Werner Rolewinck, writes, in\r\nhis _Outline History of the World_ (_Fasciculus Temporum_): “The art\r\nof printing which has been discovered in Mayence is the art of arts,\r\nthe science of sciences, by means of which it will be possible to place\r\nin the hands of all men treasures of literature and of knowledge which\r\nhave heretofore been out of their reach.”\r\n\r\nJoh. Rauchler, the first Rector of the Tübingen High School (later the\r\nUniversity of Tübingen), rejoices that through the new art so many\r\nauthors can now be brought within the reach of students in Latin,\r\nGreek, and Hebrew, authors who are witnesses for the Christian faith,\r\nand the service of whose writings to the Church and to the world is so\r\ngreat, that he can but consider “this art as a gift directly from God\r\nhimself.”[434] Felix Fabri, Prior of the Dominican monastery in Ulm,\r\nsays, in his _Historia Suevorum_, issued in the year 1459, that “no art\r\nthat the world has known can be considered so worthy, so useful, so\r\nmuch to be esteemed, indeed, so divine as that which has now, through\r\nthe Grace of God, been discovered in Mayence.”\r\n\r\nThe first printing work done by the Brothers of Common Life dates\r\nfrom 1468. They appear to have promptly utilised their scribes as\r\ncompositors and their illuminators as designers for the new form in\r\nwhich their books were produced. Many of the Benedictine monasteries\r\nwhich had for so many centuries led the way in the preservation and\r\nthe multiplication of literature at once associated presses with their\r\nmonasteries and had their monks trained in the art of setting type and\r\nof printing sheets.\r\n\r\nAmong the monastery printing-presses were those of the Carthusian\r\nmonastery in Strasburg, the monastery of S. Ulrich and Afra, in\r\nAugsburg, and the Benedictine monasteries in Nuremberg and Rostock.\r\nAs a rule, in places where the work of scribes had been active, the\r\nprinting-press found a ready acceptance. It was not long, however,\r\nbefore so great a development in the methods of the printing business\r\nwas brought about that it became difficult for the monasteries to carry\r\non the work effectively, and by the middle of the sixteenth century the\r\nproduction of books in monasteries had practically ceased.\r\n\r\nThe favourable relations between the Church and the printers were\r\nchecked by the Humanistic movement, which, a generation or more\r\nbefore the Reformation, began to bring into question the authority\r\nof the Church and the infallibility of papacy. The influence of the\r\nHumanistic teachers was so largely furthered by the co-operation\r\nof the printers that the jealousy and dread of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities were promptly aroused, and they began to utter fulminations\r\nagainst the wicked and ignorant men who were using the art of printing\r\nfor misleading the community and for the circulation of error.\r\nThe ecclesiastics, who had at first favoured the widest possible\r\ncirculation of the Scriptures, now contended that much of the heretical\r\nteaching was due to the misunderstanding of the Scriptures on the part\r\nof readers who were acting without the guidance of their spiritual\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the Church now began to take the ground that the\r\nreading of the Scriptures by individuals was not to be permitted,\r\nand that the Bible was to be given to the community only through\r\nthe interpretation of the Church. At the same time, the authority\r\nof the Church was exerted to repress, or at least to restrict, the\r\noperations of the printing-press, and to bring printers and publishers\r\nunder a close ecclesiastical supervision and censorship. It was\r\nnow, however, too late to stand between the printing-press and the\r\npeople. Large portions of the community had become accustomed to a\r\nwide circulation of books and to the selection without restriction of\r\nsuch reading-matter as might be placed within their reach, and this\r\nprivilege they were no longer willing to forego.\r\n\r\nIt was nevertheless true that in certain countries, particularly in\r\nItaly and in France, the censorship of the Church was strong enough\r\nseriously to hamper and interfere with publishing undertakings and to\r\ncheck the natural development of literary production. Even in Italy,\r\nhowever, the critical spirit was found to be too strong to be entirely\r\ncrushed out, and from Venice, the most important of the Italian\r\npublishing centres, it proved possible to secure for the productions of\r\nthe printing-press a circulation that was practically independent of\r\nthe censorship of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Humanistic movement was, on other grounds, of immediate service for\r\nthe printers and publishers, in that it brought about an active demand\r\nfor the works of classical writers, a demand which it required the\r\nfullest resources of the earlier printers to supply.\r\n\r\nIf the invention of Gutenberg had taken shape during the period when\r\nthere happened to be no such active intellectual literary interests,\r\nthe first printers might easily have found it difficult to secure\r\nbusiness for their presses and the development of the business of book\r\nproduction would have been seriously hampered. The long series of\r\ncontroversies which were brought into being by the Reformation, and\r\nthe large mass of controversial literature which was the result of\r\nthe Reformation, constituted, a generation later, another favourable\r\ninfluence in securing an assured foundation for the business of the\r\nprinters. If it be the case that the work of the leaders of the\r\nReformation could hardly have been carried on without the aid of the\r\nprinting-press, it is also true that at a time when the business of the\r\nearly printers was in a very critical and unremunerative condition,\r\nthe impetus given to the production of literature, and the increased\r\neagerness on the part of the common people for literature, formed an\r\nessential factor in making an assured foundation for the business of\r\nthe printers and the publishers.\r\n\r\nIn 1462, on the 28th of October, Archbishop Adolph of Nassau captured\r\nthe city of Mayence and gave it over to his soldiers for plunder. The\r\ntypesetters and printers, with all other artisans whose work depended\r\nupon the commerce of the city, were driven to flight, and it appeared\r\nfor the moment as if the newly instituted printing business had been\r\ncrushed out. The result of the scattering of the printers, however, was\r\nthe introduction of the new art into a number of other centres where\r\nthe influences were favourable for its development.\r\n\r\nThe typesetters of Mayence, driven from their printing-offices by the\r\nheavy hand of the Church, journeyed throughout the world, carrying\r\ntheir new knowledge and training and they were able to give to many\r\ncommunities the means of education and enlightenment through which the\r\ngreat revolt against the Church was finally instituted. The work of\r\nthe printers, checked for the time in Mayence, took shape promptly in\r\nStrasburg, and from there was taken down the Rhine to Cologne, and in\r\na few years was also in active operation in Basel, Augsburg, Ulm, and\r\nNuremberg. In 1464, as elsewhere described, German printers carried\r\ntheir invention into Italy and erected the first Italian printing-press\r\nin Subiaco. And in 1470, also through Germans, the work of the printers\r\nbegan in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe shrewd and enterprising merchant Fust, by means of whose capital\r\nGutenberg had been able to begin his business operations, would\r\nhardly have pressed his suit against his associate, if he had not had\r\nconfidence in the value of the invention. As soon as, through the\r\ndecision of 1455, he came into possession of the presses, he at once\r\nput these again into operation. He found a practical superintendent\r\nor co-worker in Peter Schöffer. Schöffer was a German by birth, but\r\nhad carried on work in Paris as a scribe or writer of higher class\r\nmanuscripts, as illuminator, and as a manuscript-dealer. Returning to\r\nMayence in 1454, he had entered the employ of Gutenberg as type-setter\r\nand proof-reader. Later, having married the daughter of Fust, he was\r\ntaken into partnership by his father-in-law, and was able to make a\r\nsatisfactory organisation and a wide development for the business of\r\nthe printing-office. The first publication issued by Fust & Schöffer\r\nwas a psalter printed (in Latin) on parchment, with the great missal\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe second work, undertaken, not at the risk of the printers, but at\r\nthe cost of two of the Mayence monasteries, was an edition of a great\r\nchoir-book. This psalter, or rather _psalterium_, is the first printed\r\nwork in which the name of the printer is given and the date of the\r\npublication. It apparently proved possible to secure for this book even\r\nwith the very inadequate distributing machinery that was available, a\r\nremunerative sale, as it was printed again in 1490, in 1502, in 1515,\r\nand in 1516.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier publications of Fust & Schöffer are the _Rationale\r\nDivinorum Officiorum_ of the Dominican monk Durandus, which was issued\r\nin 1459, the _Codex Constitutionum_ of Pope Clement, issued in 1460,\r\nand the _Bull_ of Emperor Frederic III. against Diether von Isenburg,\r\nprinted in 1461. The most beautiful and most important production of\r\ntheir press was, however, the great Latin Bible issued in 1462, in two\r\nfolio volumes, and which is known as the “48 line Bible.”\r\n\r\nThe work of the printing-office was, as previously stated, stopped by\r\nthe sacking of the city, and the two partners appear to have migrated\r\nfor the time to Frankfort. In 1464, they were again in Mayence, and\r\nin that year they published the sixth book of the _Decretals_ of Pope\r\nBoniface VIII., and the _De Officiis_ of Cicero. The latter was the\r\nfirst of the German editions of the classics, and remained a favourite\r\nbook with the German printers, being repeatedly reprinted.\r\n\r\nIn 1453, Fust made a journey to Paris in order to find sale there\r\nfor his big Bible. This was four years before the first Paris\r\nprinting-press began its work, and it was in connection with this\r\nbig Bible that the gossip arose of Fust being able, through compact\r\nwith the Devil, to produce an indefinite number of copies of a book.\r\nIt could not be understood how in any other way these copies could\r\nbe offered so cheaply. The University of Paris was at that date the\r\nmost important in Europe, and the influence of the University upon the\r\ncultivation of the city and its close relations with the old book-trade\r\nin manuscripts, had made Paris the most important European centre for\r\nliterary production and the place where scholars were in the habit\r\nof looking for their material. It was in Paris, if anywhere, that it\r\nshould prove possible to find sale for the Latin Bible, and Fust’s\r\nefforts appear to have met with a prompt success. The first Bible\r\nbearing a date was completed in 1462, and is known as the Mayence\r\nBible. At the time it was in readiness (in October) nothing could be\r\ndone in getting it into the market, as Mayence was being besieged by\r\nAdolph of Nassau. In 1466, Fust is again in Paris with copies of the\r\nsecond edition of his _De Officiis_, and with other of his publications.\r\n\r\nThere is still preserved in the city library of Geneva a copy of this\r\nedition of Cicero, which contains the record that it was bought by\r\nLouis de la Vernada, in Paris, in July, 1466, from Fust.[435]\r\n\r\nFust & Schöffer may claim to have been the first printers who\r\nacted also as publishers and booksellers. Notwithstanding the many\r\ndifficulties with which they had had to contend, they were able to\r\noffer their books at prices which, to the old dealers in manuscripts,\r\nseemed astounding and which gave some pretext for the charge of magic.\r\nMadden says that a copy of the “48 line Bible” printed on parchment,\r\ncould be bought in Paris, in 1470, for 2000 francs, and that the cost\r\nof the same text a few years earlier in manuscript form would have been\r\nfive times as great. Bishop John of Aleria, writing in 1467 to Pope\r\nPaul II., says that it is now possible to purchase in Rome for 20\r\ngulden, gold, works which a few years earlier would have cost not less\r\nthan 100 gulden, and that other books now selling as low as 4 gulden\r\nwould previously have cost not less than 20 gulden. The first results\r\nof the printing-press appear, therefore, to have been a reduction of\r\nabout four fifths in the price of work of a scholarly character.\r\n\r\nFust is entitled to the description, not only of the second printer\r\nand of the first publisher, but of the first pirate in printed\r\nbooks. In 1465, Mentel printed in Strasburg under the title of _De\r\nArte Prædicatoria_, the fourth book of S. Augustine’s _De Doctrina\r\nChristiana_. The editor states that he had, for the purpose of this\r\nedition, collected manuscript texts in the libraries of Heidelberg,\r\nSpeyer, Worms, and Strasburg, and that he had induced Joh. Mentel,\r\na “master of the art of printing,” to put the volume into a form\r\navailable for the general use of clerics.\r\n\r\nFust reprinted this volume in 1466, following the text with precision,\r\nand simply replacing Mentel’s name with his own. This is the first\r\ninstance of literary appropriation of which there is any record, after\r\nthe beginning of printing.[436]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Fust, which occurred early in 1467, Schöffer\r\ncontinued the business with Fust’s sons, and established branches in\r\nParis and in Angers. His name appears for the first time alone on the\r\ntitle-page of the _Thomas Aquinas_, published in a folio of 516 pages\r\nin March, 1467. He prints it in full as Petrus Schoiffher de Gernsheim.\r\nIn a receipt for 15 gold crowns, paid by the College of Autun for\r\na copy of this, Schoiffher styles himself _Impressor Librorum_. He\r\nappears to have made sale in Paris not only of his own publications,\r\nbut of the books issued by other German printers.\r\n\r\nIn a copy of the work of Johannus Scotus, printed by Koberger in 1474,\r\nnow contained in the library of the Paris Arsenal, appears the entry,\r\n“I, Peter Schöffer, printer from Mayence, acknowledge that I have\r\nreceived from the worthy Magistrate, Johannus Henrici, of Pisa, three\r\n_scuta_ as the price of this book.”[437] Schöffer seems to have acted\r\nin some measure also as purchasing agent for the University of Paris,\r\nthrough an associate, Guimier, who was a licensed member of the Paris\r\nguild. The Paris branch of the business was given up a few years later,\r\nand Schöffer devoted his energies to extending his trade in Germany. In\r\n1479, his name appears in the list of the citizens of Frankfort, and\r\nthe removal to Frankfort of his publishing headquarters constituted\r\nthe first step towards the selection of that city as the centre of\r\nthe publishing and bookselling trade of Germany, a position that it\r\nretained for more than a century. Schöffer continued, however, to do\r\nthe work of his printing in Mayence.\r\n\r\nSome light is thrown upon the extent of the publishing undertakings\r\ncarried on at the time by Schöffer with his associate Hancquis, by the\r\nrecord of a suit brought by the two partners in 1480 against a certain\r\nBernhard Inkus, of Frankfort. They charged Inkus with having begun\r\nthe publication of a considerable series of books, the property right\r\nin which (_Eigentumsrecht_) vested in themselves and in Conrad Henki\r\n(who was a son of Fust). It does not appear from the record of this\r\ntrial on what grounds Schöffer and his associates claimed the right to\r\ncontrol these books, or whether the unauthorised issues of which they\r\ncomplained had been printed by the defendant Inkus or were simply being\r\noffered for sale by him on behalf of other printers.\r\n\r\nThe case appears to have been referred or possibly appealed to a court\r\nin Basel, and by this court was issued some preliminary injunction\r\nagainst the continued sale of the books complained of. The record\r\ngiving the final decision of the case is, however, missing. The lack\r\nof full details of the suit is the more to be regretted as it appears\r\nto have been the first case after the invention of printing involving,\r\nif not copyright ownership, at least a certain control by contract.\r\n\r\nIn the same year we find the Magistracy of the City of Frankfort\r\napplying to the Magistracy of the City of Lübeck for the protection\r\nof Schöffer against some illegitimate infringement of Schöffer’s\r\nbusiness rights on the part of the Lübeck citizen Hans Bitz. Here also\r\nis there no record as to the result of the application. The firm also\r\nhad dealings with Ulm, as appears from a claim made, in 1481, for the\r\ncollection of the moneys due from certain citizens in Ulm--Harscher,\r\nRuwinger, and Ofener, for books delivered. They sent to Ulm, with\r\na protection certificate given by Elector Diether of Mayence, a\r\nrepresentative who was empowered to collect the money. There was at\r\nthe outset some delay in connection with an alleged informality in his\r\nauthorisation, but the Magistracy of Ulm sent back word that as soon as\r\nthe requisite authorisation was secured, the collection of the money\r\nwould be enforced in due course.\r\n\r\nThese cases are evidence of a certain organisation of machinery for\r\nthe distribution of books and for the management of a publishing\r\nbusiness, within a comparatively brief period after the beginning of\r\nthe work of the printing-presses, and they indicate also that the\r\nsecond firm which entered into the business of printing had succeeded\r\nin establishing such business on fairly assured foundations, and in\r\ncarrying on successfully large undertakings. It is to be noted further\r\nthat Fust & Schöffer, and other of the earlier German printers, did\r\ntheir work without the assistance of any patronage, and without even\r\nthe advantage of a university connection. The early printers of Italy\r\nwould have found it impracticable to carry on their operations without\r\nthe assistance of certain wealthy and enterprising noblemen who were\r\nprepared to interest themselves in the new art either from curiosity\r\nor from philanthropy, and as late even as 1495, that is to say nearly\r\nhalf a century after the beginning of printing, the organisation of\r\nthe business of Aldus was dependent upon the favour and services of\r\ncertain of his noble friends. In Paris the first printers were helped,\r\nand in part supported, by the money of patrons or of the Crown, and\r\nby the co-operation and influence of the University. In England also\r\nthe influence of Oxford was of material importance in securing for the\r\nfirst printers some assured foundation and support, while the work\r\nof Caxton and his immediate successors in London was also largely\r\nfurthered by, if not actually dependent upon, the work or help of noble\r\nand wealthy friends.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, however, the printing work began, as we have seen, through\r\nthe enterprise and ingenuity of a citizen manufacturer who was\r\nsupported by the middle class of the community, and who made his first\r\nconnections directly with the townspeople. The help of the universities\r\nappears to have been of comparatively smaller importance. It probably\r\ncounted for more in Cologne than in any other of the university cities\r\nin which the earlier printers did their work.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the thirty-six years of his independent business\r\nactivity, that is from the death of Fust in 1466 to the time of his\r\nown death, Schöffer printed in all fifty-nine works which bear date\r\nand which have been identified as his. His firm took rank for this\r\nperiod as by far the most important printing and publishing concern in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWith hardly an exception, the books issued from his press were folios.\r\nThey were printed with fifty to sixty lines on the page, and contained\r\nan average of about 300 pages or 150 sheets.\r\n\r\nAmong the works included in the list are the _Constitutiones_\r\nof Clement V., the _Institutions_ of Justinian, the _Expositio\r\nSententiarum_ of Thomas Aquinas, the _Epistolæ_ of S. Jerome, the\r\nsixth book of the _Decretals_ of Boniface VIII., the _Decretals_ of\r\nGregory IX., the _Codex_ of Justinian, and the _Expositio Psalterii_\r\nof Joh. Torquemada. The last named volume had already been printed in\r\nSubiaco and again in Rome under the direct supervision of the author,\r\nwho was supplying the funds for carrying on the first printing-office\r\nestablished in Italy.\r\n\r\nAfter Schöffer’s death in 1502, his son printed an edition of the\r\n_Mercurius Trimegistus_.\r\n\r\nI do not find record of the arrangement entered into by Schöffer for\r\nthe editing of the texts of the works printed by him. The collection\r\nof manuscripts for use as “copy” for printers, and the collection of\r\ndifferent manuscripts in order to secure the most complete and accurate\r\ntexts, must have called for a considerable measure of scholarly and of\r\ngeneral literary knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Schöffer had enjoyed opportunities for making\r\nhimself a scholarly authority, or that he ever made claim to any\r\nspecial scholarly attainments. There is no record of editorial work\r\ndone by himself in the books issued from his press, as was the case\r\nto so exceptional a degree a few years later with the books printed\r\nby Aldus; nor has Schöffer preserved in connection with his editions\r\nthe names of the editors who supervised their publication, as came to\r\nbe the practice later with the issues of the Aldine press, of Froben\r\nin Basel, and of Koberger in Nuremberg. As far as I can ascertain,\r\nhowever, the Schöffer texts compared favourably for accuracy and for\r\nauthority with other of the earlier printed books, and it is to be\r\nassumed, therefore, that he had been able to organise an adequate\r\ncritical staff or to secure from time to time, as required, the\r\nservices of competent scholars.\r\n\r\nThe business founded by Gutenberg, taken possession of under mortgage\r\nby Fust, and carried on first by Fust & Schöffer, and later by Schöffer\r\nand other associates, lasted nearly one hundred years. The first\r\npublication was, as noted, the big _Psalterium_, printed in 1457,\r\nand the last, an edition of the German version of the books of Livy,\r\nprinted by Ivo Schöffer in 1557.\r\n\r\nIt seems evident that while the credit for the great invention fairly\r\nbelongs to Gutenberg, and the original planning and initiative of the\r\nbusiness were his, a large measure of business capacity must have\r\nbelonged to his partner Fust, who had also, to be sure, the advantage\r\nof being a capitalist to begin with, a factor as important in the\r\nearliest time of publishing as in the present day.\r\n\r\nOne of the most definite pieces of testimony in regard to the\r\nconnection of Gutenberg with the invention of printing, testimony which\r\npossesses special value as coming from a person possessing first-hand\r\nknowledge of the facts, is contained in an Epilogue written in verse\r\nby John Schöffer (son of Peter), and printed at the end of the _Livy_\r\npublished by him in 1505. It is addressed to the Emperor Maximilian,\r\nand reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“May your Majesty deign to accept this book which was printed at\r\nMayence, the town in which the admirable art of typography was\r\ninvented, in the year 1450, by John Gutenberg, and afterwards brought\r\nto perfection at the expense, and by the labour, of John Fust and Peter\r\nSchöffer.”\r\n\r\nIt would not belong to the plan of this historical sketch to give in\r\ndetail a record of the successive concerns which carried on throughout\r\nGermany, with increasing rapidity and with undertakings of ever\r\nwidening importance, the business of printing and publishing. I propose\r\nmerely to present the records of a few of the earlier concerns, and to\r\nmake such reference to typical firms of later generations as may give\r\nan impression of the gradual development of the book-trade, and as may\r\nserve also as examples from which to judge of the development of the\r\nidea of the literary property in Germany, and the varying positions\r\ntaken under the enactments and other governmental measures in regard to\r\nsuch property.\r\n\r\nThe books printed during the first half-century were, as we shall note,\r\nalmost exclusively reissues of ecclesiastical or pagan classics, and\r\napart from such original work as may have been put into introductions\r\nor notes, did not call for the labour of contemporary authors. Among\r\nthe earlier of original German publications is to be classed a German\r\ngrammar entitled _Die Leyenschul_, printed by Peter Jordan in Mayence\r\nin 1531. This grammar, which remained for a considerable time an\r\nauthority on its subject, does not bear the name of the author or\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nAnother of the earlier original works for the sale of which the author\r\nmay have secured some compensation was the _Astronomie_ of Joh.\r\nStöffler, which was printed in Ottenheim in 1513.\r\n\r\nOne of the more important of the earlier publishing concerns of Mayence\r\nwas that of Franz Behem, who printed in the ten years succeeding 1539\r\nan important series of theological works. With the close of Behem’s\r\nbusiness in 1552, Mayence appears to have lost its relative importance\r\nin connection with the work of printing and publishing.\r\n\r\nIn Strasburg, which had contested with Mayence the prestige of being\r\nthe actual birthplace of the printing-press, important publishing\r\nundertakings were carried on from a very early date, and for a number\r\nof years the city of Basel alone could compete with Strasburg in the\r\nnumber and importance of the books issued from its presses. The two\r\npublishing concerns whose individual enterprises and whose rivalry\r\nwith each other did so much to bring Strasburg into importance as a\r\nfactor in the German book-trade, were those of Johann Mentel and of\r\nHeinrich Eggestein. Mentel’s first publications were a Latin Bible in\r\ntwo folio volumes, which was the first Bible printed in the smaller\r\nGothic type; an edition of _De Doctrina Christiana_ of S. Augustine; an\r\nedition of the _Summa_ of Thomas Aquinas; an edition of the Bible in\r\nGerman, which appeared in 1466; the _Speculum Historiale_ of Vincentius\r\nBellovacensis, etc. Madden finds record of twenty-one publications\r\nwhich can certainly be identified as Mentel’s, and which comprise in\r\nall forty-one volumes, of which thirty-seven are in large folio. During\r\nthe time of his business activity, (1465-1478) he appears to have\r\npublished about two volumes a year.[438]\r\n\r\nHumphreys points out that Mentel was in advance of the other German\r\nprinters of the day in first using, in place of the confused old\r\nGothic black letter, the clear Roman letter which was in use in Italy.\r\nMentel’s most important publication, the collection of the _Specula_\r\nof S. Vincent of Beauvais, issued in 1473, in eight volumes folio,\r\nwas printed in type of the Roman letter.[439] M. Bernard, in his\r\n_Origines de l’Imprimerie_, is of opinion that it was in printing these\r\ntheological works which were in accord with the taste of the reading\r\npublic of his day, that Mentel realised a fortune, while many of his\r\ncompetitors ruined themselves in reproducing the Latin classics, the\r\ntaste for which before the close of the fifteenth century was not\r\nsufficiently developed to ensure a remunerative sale. He was also the\r\nfirst of the German printers to print descriptive catalogues of his\r\nbooks. At the head of the catalogue was a notice to the following\r\neffect: “Those who wish to possess any of these books have only to\r\naddress themselves to the sign of----.” Here a blank was left, in order\r\nthat each retail bookseller to whom the catalogue was sent might fill\r\nin his own name and sign. Such a detail (which is, I may mention, quite\r\nin accord with modern publishing methods) indicates that there was as\r\nearly as 1470, a well developed bookselling machinery in western and\r\ncentral Germany.\r\n\r\nMentel’s principal rival in Strasburg was Heinrich Eggestein.\r\nEggestein appears to have been a man of scholarly training, and had\r\nreceived from some university the degree “Magister.” To him belongs\r\nthe credit of the issue, in 1466, of the first Bible printed in\r\nGerman. Important as was this work, the printer was not interested in\r\nassociating with it his imprint, and the volumes are identified as\r\nthe work of his press only by circumstantial evidence.[440] The first\r\nwork which was edited and which bears his imprint was an edition of\r\nthe _Decretum Gratiani_, printed in a gigantic folio in 1471. Before\r\nthis date, he had issued three Bibles in Latin text. The _Decretum_\r\nwas again printed by Eggestein in 1472, although the original issue\r\nof 1471 had been promptly pirated by the enterprising Schöffer. It is\r\nevident that it proved possible to secure for the book an immediate and\r\npresumably remunerative sale.\r\n\r\nAnother of Eggestein’s publications in 1472 was an edition of\r\n_Clementinæ_. In this he gives his imprint and gives notice also that\r\nhe has already issued a long series of books treating of “divine and\r\nhuman law.” The last book bearing a date, issued by Eggestein is the\r\n_Decretals_ of Innocent IV., printed in 1478.\r\n\r\nThe third Strasburg printer was George Huszner, who was originally a\r\ngoldsmith. He married the daughter of another goldsmith, Nikolaus of\r\nHanau, who later worked with his son-in-law as _aurifaber et pressor\r\nlibrorum_.[441] The _Speculum Judiciale_ of Bishop Wilhelm Duranti,\r\nprinted by Huszner in 1473, is described by Kapp as a master-piece of\r\ntypography. This bears the name as editor of Joh. Beckenhub, who calls\r\nhimself a cleric. Martin Flach of Strasburg, whose business activity\r\ncovered the years 1475 to 1500 published something over seventy works,\r\nwhich were, with hardly an exception, devoted to theology and dogma.\r\n\r\nIn 1480, was printed a magnificent edition of the Latin Bible in\r\nfour volumes, known as _Biblia Latina cum glossa ordinaria Walafridi\r\nStrabonis et interlineari Anselmi Laudunensis_. This was issued by\r\nAnton Koberger of Nuremberg and it has only recently been discovered\r\nthat it was printed for him by Adolph Rusch of Strasburg. While it was\r\nby far the most noteworthy typographical undertaking that had been\r\ncompleted up to that date, the printer had not thought it important\r\nto associate his name with the volumes. Rusch was a publisher as well\r\nas a printer, and was also a large dealer in paper, supplying this to\r\nprinters in Strasburg, Nuremberg, Basel, and elsewhere. He further\r\ncarried on a miscellaneous business as a bookseller and in purchasing\r\nfrom other publishers for his miscellaneous trade supplies of other\r\npublications, and he was accustomed to make payment for the same in\r\npaper. He seems altogether to have been a man of very wide activities,\r\nwhose influence must have been of considerable importance in connection\r\nwith the early organisation of the German book-trade. He had married\r\na daughter of the Strasburg printer, Mentel, and through his wife,\r\ninherited an interest in Mentel’s business. Rusch purchased from the\r\nprinter Amerbach, in exchange for paper stock, a portion of the edition\r\nof S. Augustine’s _De Civitate Dei_, which appears to have shared with\r\ncertain essays of Cicero the honour of being one of the most frequently\r\nprinted books in the early lists.\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier of the Strasburg printers who gave particular\r\nattention to works in German was Johann Reinhart, also known (from his\r\nbirthplace) as Johann Grüninger, whose list comprised German editions\r\nof works in theology and religion, and in poetic literature, together\r\nwith a series of folk-songs and stories for the people. While his\r\nfellow publishers were at that time, with hardly an exception, limiting\r\ntheir undertakings to works planned for scholars, such as reprints\r\nof the classics and theological works printed in Latin, Reinhart\r\naddressed himself at once to a popular audience, and while in so doing\r\nhe was undoubtedly of service in furthering the education of his\r\ngeneration, he appears also to have secured for himself satisfactory\r\nbusiness results. He gave particular attention to illustrated books,\r\nsecuring the service of a number of noteworthy designers and engravers,\r\nand ornamenting his books, not only with full-page illustrations,\r\nbut with elaborate initial letters and head- and tail-pieces. He is\r\nchronicled as being the only publisher in Strasburg who, after the\r\nReformation was in full development, continued to print Catholic\r\ntracts and pamphlets. As an instance of the large distribution that it\r\nwas possible to secure at the beginning of the sixteenth century for\r\ncertain classes of books, is to be noted the sale made by Reinhart in\r\n1502 to Schönsperger, of 1000 copies of a volume of _The Lives of the\r\nSaints_. Reinhart was one of the printers whose presses were utilised\r\nby the great publisher Koberger of Nuremberg. In 1525, he printed for\r\nKoberger the translation by Pirckheimer of the great Geography of\r\nPtolemy. In this work the translator appears himself to have retained\r\nan interest.\r\n\r\nThere have been preserved a number of the letters which passed between\r\nPirckheimer, Koberger, and Reinhart, while this work was going through\r\nthe press. It appears that, notwithstanding Reinhart’s personal\r\nsupervision of the undertaking and his interest in securing for the\r\npages satisfactory ornamentations, Pirckheimer had found frequent\r\noccasion for dissatisfaction and criticisms, and in his letters\r\nthere are many expressions which might have been written by authors\r\nof to-day who were not satisfied that the printers were following\r\n“copy” correctly. At one point, Pirckheimer says that if he could have\r\nforeseen all the difficulties that he was to experience in securing a\r\ncorrect printing for his volume, he would have burned the manuscript\r\nrather than have put it to press.\r\n\r\nReinhart points out, on his part, however, that, in the first\r\nplace, the manuscript had not been prepared in such manner that the\r\ncompositors could follow it correctly, and that, secondly, he had given\r\nno little of his own personal attention to re-arranging and re-shaping\r\nthe “copy” in order that the text might be as correct as possible.\r\n\r\nPirckheimer was also unhappy in connection with certain of the designs\r\nwith which the printer had ornamented his text, and expresses the wish\r\nthat in place of using Italian designers, the printer had given the\r\nwork to good Germans.[442]\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the eleventh century, Cologne had competed with\r\nMayence for the distinction of being the most important trade centre of\r\nGermany. Its favourable position made it a natural point of exchange\r\nfor business operations between the dealers of the North Sea and those\r\nof the Mediterranean. To Cologne came from the south by way of the\r\npasses of the Alps, the wares, not only of Italy, but those which had\r\nbeen brought from the East by the vessels of Venice and of Genoa, while\r\nfrom the great Russian mart of Novgorod and the enterprising Hanseatic\r\ncity Lübeck, were brought the goods of Russia and of the far North.\r\nIn Cologne were also ware-houses under the charge of trading guilds\r\nof their several nations, whither were brought the goods of England,\r\nFrance, and the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in mercantile undertakings, however, that the city had\r\nsecured for itself prestige. The University, founded in the early part\r\nof the fourteenth century on the model of that of Paris, was considered\r\nto have surpassed in the importance of its scholarly work the older\r\ninstitutions of Heidelberg, Prague, and Vienna; and it remained for\r\nmany years at the head of the scholarship of Germany and a particular\r\nexponent of the doctrinal theology of the Catholic Church. Cologne\r\nwas, therefore, recognised by the early printers as an exceptionally\r\nfavourable centre for the prosperous development of their work, and the\r\nprinting and publishing undertakings of the city assumed at an early\r\ndate very considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThe existing library of the city contains over 400 works, principally\r\ntheological, but including also volumes in jurisprudence and in higher\r\nclass instruction, which were produced by Cologne printers before the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century. At this time the University contained\r\nno less than 4000 students, and the requirements of these students for\r\ntext-books and of their instructors for works of reference, must have\r\ngiven a very decided impetus to the work of the earlier publishers,\r\nwhile the trade connections possessed by Cologne with the cities of\r\nthe North and East furnished channels through which the publishers\r\nwere able to extend the demand for their books. The first introduction\r\nof the printing-press into Cologne was due to the sacking of the\r\nCity of Mayence in 1462, when Ulrich Zell, of Hanau, who like Peter\r\nSchöffer, called himself a _clericus moguntinensis_, and who had\r\nbeen an apprentice of Gutenberg, having been driven from Mayence,\r\nbrought to Cologne the invention of his master. While it is possible\r\nthat his printing undertakings began earlier, the first dated work\r\nissued from his press was published in 1466, and was an edition of\r\nthe _Liber Johannes Chrysostomi super Psalmo Quinquagesimo_. This was\r\npromptly followed by a volume containing the _De Officiis_ of Cicero.\r\nNo publishing list of the period appears to have progressed very far\r\nwithout including one or more of the essays of Cicero. The latest book\r\npublished by Zell was a commentary by Girard Hardervicus on the new\r\nLogic of Albertus Magnus. The list of books known to have been produced\r\nby Zell includes no less than 120 titles, but a large number of these\r\nwere pamphlets of moderate compass, and only eighteen were in the folio\r\nform which was the standard of the time.\r\n\r\nA printer whose work was in part contemporary with that of Zell, was\r\nJohann Koelhoff, who included in his list eighty publications, of which\r\nseven were in the German tongue. These last are spoken of by Kapp as\r\npossessing distinctive interest for theologians, because they included\r\nsome of the earliest printed examples of the Low-German dialect.\r\nBartholomäus Unkel, whose list included in all twenty works, printed,\r\nin 1480, in the Low-German dialect an edition of the _Sachsenspiegel_,\r\na work which found place during the following century in the lists of\r\nvery many of the German publishers.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the influence of the University was given strongly\r\nto the support of Orthodox doctrines of the Catholic Church, and\r\ndoctrinal books which did not conform to the university standard of\r\northodoxy were not printed in Cologne. It is probable that in the\r\nbeginning of the publishing operations, no direct censorship was\r\nattempted on the part of the theologians of the University, but it\r\nseems evident that they were able notwithstanding, to discourage\r\npublications the opinions of which they might consider pernicious.\r\n\r\nThe name of Franz Birckmann, whose printing operations began in 1507,\r\noccupies an important place in the list of the publishers of Cologne,\r\nand his business relations with Paris and his connections with the\r\nbook-dealers of London have brought his name into reference in much\r\nof the correspondence of his time. Birckmann appears, at the outset\r\nat least, not to have himself been a printer. His first book, the\r\n_Missale Coloniense_, was printed for him in Paris. Kirchhoff speaks\r\nof Birckmann as possessing a fine business capacity and exceptional\r\nenterprise and creative genius, and refers to him as carrying on his\r\nundertakings now in London and Canterbury, then in Bruges, Liége,\r\nor Frankfort; again in Cologne, Antwerp, Tübingen, and Basel. The\r\nlist of the places visited by this enterprising publisher of the\r\ntime serves to give an indication as to the centres where literary\r\nactivities were the most important.[443] Erasmus, writing on the 21st\r\nof December, 1520, from Canterbury, to his friend Andreas Ammonius in\r\nRotterdam, speaks of Birckmann as being ready himself to undertake\r\nthe introduction into England of any books that might be called for.\r\nBirckmann appears finally to have established in London a permanent\r\nbusiness office, for the volume, _Graduale ad Usum Sarum_, which was\r\nprinted for him in Paris in 1528, bears as an imprint, Franz Birckmann\r\nof St. Paul’s Church Yard.[444]\r\n\r\nThis early connection of the publishers of Cologne with London is of\r\nspecial interest in connection with the record of William Caxton, the\r\nfirst English printer, who was said to have learned his art in Cologne\r\nand to have brought it thence (by way of Bruges) to London. In the same\r\nseries of letters to Ammonius, Erasmus speaks of giving to Birckmann\r\nthe manuscript of his _Proverbia_, of his _Plutarch_, and the _Lucian_,\r\nin order that he might arrange to have the books printed in Paris, by\r\nJodocus Badius. For some reason, not stated, Birckmann decided not to\r\nplace these works in the hands of Badius, but took them to Froben, in\r\nBasel, which was the means of bringing Erasmus into connection with\r\nthat publisher, with whom he had satisfactory intimate relations for so\r\nlarge a portion of his life.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated in another chapter, the theologians of the Faculty\r\nof the Sorbonne had taken a strong stand against the writings of\r\nErasmus, and it is very possible that Badius was unable to secure a\r\npermit or a privilege for these volumes.\r\n\r\nBirckmann seems, at about this time, to have secured some interest, if\r\nnot in the general business of Froben, at least in a certain number\r\nof his publishing undertakings. In 1526, Birckmann came into trouble\r\nwith the authorities of Antwerp on account of his having sold there\r\nan edition of the translation of S. Chrysostom, which had been made\r\nby Ökolampadius, and which had come under the ban of the Antwerp\r\ncensorship. The publisher succeeded in freeing himself from the\r\npenalties imposed by the Antwerp magistracy only after a long contest\r\nand a considerable expenditure of money.[445] It is a little difficult\r\nto understand the precise grounds of the opposition raised by the\r\nAntwerp censors, and I have not been able to get at the details of the\r\ncase. It is of interest as one of the earliest examples of censorship\r\nupon the press which occurred in Northern Europe. Kapp is of opinion\r\nthat the censorship exercised by the Church authorities in Cologne was\r\nmore rigorous than that instituted by the authorities in Bavaria. It\r\nseems certain that the Catholic University of the Rhine was able to\r\nexercise no little influence in shaping the direction of the earlier\r\nliterary undertakings of North Germany.\r\n\r\nCaxton’s sojourn in Cologne must have been some time between the years\r\n1471 and 1474. Further details concerning his work in Bruges and his\r\nlater publishing undertakings in London will be given in the chapter on\r\nprinting in England. During the latter part of the fifteenth century\r\nand the earlier years of the sixteenth, Cologne printers secured for\r\nthemselves an unenviable reputation as unauthorised reprinters of\r\nworks which were the result of the scholarly labours and investment of\r\npublishers elsewhere. They issued editions as nearly in _fac-simile_ as\r\nmight be of a number of the classics published in Venice by Aldus, and\r\nthey followed these, later, with the imitations of the scholarly texts\r\npublished by Plantin in Antwerp and by the Elzevirs in Leyden.\r\n\r\nWhile it was the case that these texts, with rare exceptions, were the\r\nwork of authors dead centuries before, and that in the works themselves\r\nthe original publishers could rightfully claim no control, it is to\r\nbe borne in mind that the production of the earlier editions of such\r\nclassics had nevertheless called for a very considerable expenditure\r\nof capital and of labour, as well in the securing of the codices\r\nused as “copy” by the type-setters as in the revision and editing of\r\nthese codices by the scholarly commentators employed, and also in the\r\npreparation of notes, introductions, and elucidations for the volumes.\r\nThe risk and investment incurred by Aldus in the production of his\r\nedition of _Aristotle_, and the exceptional character of the original\r\nlabour invested by the publisher in such a work are grounds for\r\nconsidering that his contention for the control of the text which came\r\nfrom his printing-office, at least for a certain term of years, was as\r\nwell founded as might be a contention of to-day for a book which was in\r\nits entirety the work of a contemporary writer.\r\n\r\nThe city whose publishing operations are next to be considered in\r\nthe chronological record is Basel. For a number of years after the\r\ninvention of printing, Basel remained one of the most important\r\npublishing centres, not only of the German Empire (to which at this\r\ntime the city belonged), but of Europe. Its position on a direct line\r\nof communication between Italy and Germany had given it an importance\r\nin connection with the general trade of Europe, and the facilities\r\nwhich furthered this general trade became of value also in connection\r\nwith the production of books. The University of Basel, founded in 1460,\r\nspeedily brought to the city men devoted to scholarly pursuits, many of\r\nwhom took an early interest in the work of the printing-press, and were\r\nready to give their co-operation to publishers like Froben, not only in\r\nediting manuscripts for the press, but even in the routine work of the\r\nprinting-offices in the proof-reading and correcting. In 1501, at the\r\ntime Basel broke away from the imperial control, the city had already\r\nsecured for itself a cosmopolitan character, and had become a kind of\r\nmeeting place for the exchange of thought as well as for the goods of\r\nrepresentatives of all nations. At this time there were in the city no\r\nless than twenty-six important publishing and printing concerns. The\r\nearliest book bearing a date and an imprint which was issued from a\r\nBasel printing-press was an edition of the _Gregorii Magni Moralia in\r\nJobum_, which appeared in 1468. But one or two copies exist, of which\r\nthe one that is in the best preservation is contained in the National\r\nLibrary of Paris.\r\n\r\nPrinting was introduced into Basel by Berthold Ruppel, who, in 1455,\r\nhad been an apprentice with Fust. The first work which is identified\r\nas Berthold’s, but which does not bear a date, is the _Repertorium\r\nVocabulorum Exquisitorum_ of Conrad de Mure. The difficulties which\r\nhave attended all organisations of labour appear to have begun at an\r\nearly date in Basel, as there is record of a strike of the compositors\r\noccurring as early as 1471. This strike lasted for a number of months\r\nand was finally adjusted by the arbitration of the authorities of the\r\ntown, certain concessions being made on the part of both the master\r\nand the employees. The magistrate issued a decision or mandate to the\r\neffect that on a certain date the workmen must return to their shops\r\nand accept the authority of their masters, and this order appears to\r\nhave been accepted. It does not appear what course could have been\r\ntaken to force the men to their work in case they might still have been\r\nrecalcitrant. The fact that a difference between the printers and their\r\nmen should have been a matter of such general importance indicates that\r\nalready within twenty years of the beginning of printing in Germany,\r\nthe business in Basel had assumed large proportions.\r\n\r\nIn 1474, there was printed in Basel an edition of the _Sachsenspiegel_,\r\na work of popular character, which can share with the Bible and with\r\ndifferent essays of Cicero, the honour of being the most frequently\r\npublished book in Germany during the first quarter century of printing.\r\n\r\nBetween 1478 and 1514, Johann Amerbach, one of the most scholarly of\r\nthe early editors, printers, and publishers of Germany, made Basel his\r\nheadquarters. His work was, however, by no means limited to Basel,\r\nas he co-operated with Koberger in Nuremberg and with other of his\r\ncontemporaries in editorial and publishing responsibilities in other\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nHis most important publication in Basel was a series of the works of\r\nthe Church Fathers. In carrying these books through the press, he was\r\nable to secure the co-operation of a number of the well known scholars\r\nof the time, including Beatus Rhenanus, Dodo, Conon, Wyler, Pellikan,\r\nand, above all, his old instructor, Heynlin.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning business in his own name in Basel, Amerbach had\r\nco-operated with Koberger in the production of the great Bible with the\r\ncommentaries of Hugo, and he was also in active relations with Rusch\r\nof Strasburg. The last book which was printed with his own name is an\r\nedition of the _Decretum Gratiani_, which appeared in 1512. His edition\r\nof the works of S. Jerome, left unfinished at the time of his death,\r\nwas completed by his pupil and successor, Johann Froben.\r\n\r\nFroben, who was like his master, not only a printer but a scholar of\r\nwide attainments, did more, possibly, than any printer of his time,\r\nexcept Aldus of Venice, to further through his publishing undertakings\r\nthe development of scholarship and of literature. He appears to have\r\nhad a thorough knowledge, not only of Latin, which was common to all\r\nthe scholars of his time, but of Greek and Hebrew, which were rarities\r\neven in university centres. It was the case with Froben, as with Aldus,\r\nthat he himself assumed the task of preparing for the press the texts\r\nof a number of works issued by him, a task which included a comparison\r\nof manuscripts, in order to secure the most correct readings, and such\r\nthorough knowledge of the text as would make possible the correction\r\nof errors, not only of typography, but of statement. Froben’s work and\r\ncharacter have been commemorated by the loving words of Erasmus, who\r\nduring the last twenty years of Froben’s life held with him the closest\r\nrelations of friendship as well as of business.\r\n\r\nIt was through Froben that the larger publishing undertakings of\r\nErasmus were carried on, undertakings which were later in part shared\r\nwith Aldus of Venice. Froben’s work was done exclusively for scholarly\r\nreaders. His imprint appears upon no book printed in German, while\r\nthe list of books issued by him during the thirty-six years of his\r\nbusiness activity includes no less than 257 works, nearly all of which\r\nwere of large compass and distinctive importance. Erasmus himself,\r\nranking at that time possibly as the greatest scholar of Europe, was\r\nready to give to Froben his assistance in supervising texts for the\r\ncompositors and in the corrections of the proofs. The details of the\r\nbusiness arrangements entered into by publishers like Froben with\r\ntheir scholarly assistants have unfortunately not been preserved, but\r\nit would appear as if in many cases these scholars had given their\r\nservices as a labour of love, and solely with a view to furthering the\r\ndevelopment of scholarship and literature. Erasmus was for a number of\r\nyears an inmate of Froben’s house, and it is probable that he received\r\na certain annual stipend for his editorial services, in addition to\r\nthe returns paid to him from the sale of his books. The most important\r\nof the issues from the Froben press in the matter of popular sale\r\nand of business success were, as indicated, the writings of Erasmus.\r\nErasmus, in fact, was possibly the first author who was able, after\r\nthe invention of printing to secure from the sale of his books any\r\nsubstantial returns. It is evident from the various references made by\r\nErasmus that those returns were sufficient to make him substantially\r\nindependent, notwithstanding the fact that piracy editions of his books\r\nwere printed in Paris, in Cologne, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFurther information concerning the publishing undertakings of Erasmus\r\nwill be found in the chapter devoted to him.\r\n\r\nPamphilus Gengenbach, described as the first dramatist of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and who was also a poet, undertook between the years 1509 and\r\n1522, the business of a printer. We do not learn with what success.\r\nA more noteworthy printer of Basel of the same period, noteworthy at\r\nleast from the point of view of commercial success, was Langendorf.\r\nHe built up his business by the publication of piracy editions of the\r\nwritings of Luther, out of which he is reported to have made large\r\nprofits.[446]\r\n\r\nThe first German printer who appears to have received honours from\r\nroyalty was a certain Heinrich Petri, who was carrying on business\r\nbetween 1520 and 1579, and who in 1556, in recognition of his services\r\nto the community, was knighted by Charles V.\r\n\r\nAs before indicated, the work of the printers and publishers of\r\nBasel was very much furthered by the presence and by the intelligent\r\nco-operation of the members of its University Faculty. The University\r\nwas of service not only in making a certain important market for\r\neditions of scholarly books, but, as a more important consideration,\r\nin giving to the publishers the aid of scholarly advisers, editors,\r\nand proof-correctors. By the close of the fifteenth century, Basel had\r\nsecured so great a prestige for the production of accurate editions of\r\nimportant texts, and for the beauty and costliness of its typography,\r\nthat commissions came to its printers from all parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1510, Sir Thomas More, desiring, as he writes, to secure a European\r\ncirculation for his books, causes the same to be printed in Basel,\r\nwhile during the years between 1490 and 1520, the popes send to Basel\r\nprinting-offices the orders for their commercial printing.\r\n\r\nThe next city in chronological order to be considered as a publishing\r\ncentre is Zurich, in which printing began in 1504.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Zurich printers whose name has been preserved is\r\nChrist Froschauer, who is known principally through his association\r\nwith Zwingli. Froschauer, who devoted himself earnestly to the cause\r\nof the Calvinists, had a religious as well as a business interest\r\nin securing a wide circulation for the works of Zwingli and his\r\nassociates, and together with these works, he printed editions of\r\nthe Bible, not only in German, but in French, Italian, Flemish,\r\nand English. Froschauer’s editions were the first Bibles printed\r\non the Continent in the English language. For these Bibles, which\r\nwere distributed at what to-day would be called popular prices, very\r\nconsiderable sales were secured, and the presses of Froschauer were\r\nthus made an important adjunct to the work of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nIn Augsburg, the printing business of which began to assume importance\r\nin 1468, the interests of the publishers were, on the other hand,\r\nlargely associated with the cause of the Roman Church. The first book\r\nwith an Augsburg imprint and date was issued by Zainer, and was an\r\nedition of the _Meditationes Vitae Domini Nostri Jesu Christi_. In\r\n1470, was published by Schüssler a Latin edition of _Josephus_, and in\r\n1477, Sorg, who was one of the most active of the Augsburg publishers,\r\nissued the book of the Council of Constance, which contained no less\r\nthan 1200 wood-cuts, presenting the 1156 coats-of-arms which were\r\nrepresented at the Council.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the printer-publishers of Augsburg was, according\r\nto Kapp, Ratdolt, whose list comprised principally mathematical works\r\nand books of religious music. His edition of _Euclid_, issued in 1482,\r\nconstituted the first European edition of the Syracusan mathematician.\r\nThe sales of the orthodox theological books, which constituted a\r\nspecial interest of the Augsburg publishers, were largely checked by\r\nthe Reformation. George Willer, an enterprising Augsburg bookseller,\r\nwho sold not only his own publications but those of other German\r\npublishers, is to be credited with the printing of the first classified\r\ncatalogue known to Germany.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier publications of Ulm, the most important was the\r\ngeography of Ptolemy, issued by Holl in 1484, with important maps.\r\n\r\nThe eminence of the city of Nuremberg in the work of publishing is\r\nprincipally due to the scholarly enterprise of one family, that of\r\nthe Kobergers, whose work began about 1470. Antonius Koberger, the\r\nfirst of the line, is grouped with Froben of Basel and with Aldus of\r\nVenice for the commercial importance of his undertakings, and above\r\nall for the scholarly ideal of his business operations. His active\r\nbusiness work covered the years 1470-1503. Among his earlier important\r\npublications was an edition of _Thomas Aquinas_, issued in 1474, and\r\nof the _Consolations of Philosophy_ of Boëthius, printed in 1475. The\r\nlatter was the first printed edition of a book which had been for\r\nnearly a thousand years famous among books in manuscript, and which\r\npossibly shares with S. Augustine’s _City of God_ the reputation of\r\nbeing the work most frequently found in the old monastery libraries.\r\nBy the year 1500, Koberger was utilising no less than twenty-four\r\npresses, and undoubtedly was sending out annually more books than any\r\nother publisher of his time. He had branches or agencies in Frankfort,\r\nParis, and Lyons, a business correspondence in the Netherlands,\r\nItaly, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and England, as well as, of course,\r\nthroughout Germany. In respect to the bulk of the business done by\r\nhim and of the commercial success secured, he was a greater publisher\r\nthan either Aldus or Froben, his two most famous contemporaries. The\r\nwork of Aldus, which is considered in detail in another chapter, was,\r\nhowever, distinctive on the ground of the special difficulties to be\r\novercome and of his enterprise and scholarly ambition in the production\r\nof Greek literature. The interest of the work of Froben centres partly\r\nin his close friendship and long association with Erasmus, and in the\r\nfact that, as the publisher for Erasmus, he secured the first important\r\ncopyright returns for a contemporary author which had been known in the\r\nrecord of publishing.\r\n\r\nKoberger gave special attention to the production of Bibles and of\r\nworks in orthodox theology. The latter division of his list was largely\r\ninterfered with by the increasing influence of the Lutherans.\r\n\r\nKoberger took the initiative in the production of books containing\r\nexpensive and elaborate illustrations, and his illustrated editions\r\nwill compare more favourably with those of Plantin and with the other\r\npublishers of the Low Countries, than is the case with the issues of\r\nany other German publisher. Nuremberg had always been the centre of art\r\ninterests, and there appear to have been in the town many designers\r\nwhose services could be secured for the production of wood-cuts.\r\n\r\nThe great German Bible, published by Koberger in 1483, filled with\r\nartistic illustrations engraved on wood, compares not unfavourably with\r\nthe illustrated Bible issued by Plantin fifty years later.\r\n\r\nThe _Schedelsche Chronik_, published in 1493, contained no less than\r\n2000 wood-cuts prepared by the Nuremberg artists, Wohlgemut and\r\nPleydenwurf. After the work of the Reformers became active, the presses\r\nof Nuremberg were occupied for some years in issuing controversial\r\ntracts and pamphlets upholding the orthodox views of the Church; while,\r\nunder an edict of the magistrates issued in 1520, the printers of\r\nNuremberg were forbidden to print and the dealers were forbidden to\r\nsell the writings of Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, and their associates.\r\nNotwithstanding this prohibition, however, there was enough sympathy\r\nwith the Reformation among many of the Nuremberg printers to keep\r\nthem interested in the surreptitious production (under risk of fine,\r\nconfiscation, and imprisonment) of very many of the Protestant tracts\r\nof the times. While the Catholic tracts were, however, catalogued in\r\ndue course and openly sold, the Protestant pamphlets had to be smuggled\r\nin and out of the city and disposed of under various covers and\r\nprecautions.\r\n\r\nIn giving chronological consideration to certain of the distinctive\r\npublishing centres and printer-publishers of Germany, it is necessary\r\nat this time to refer to the important undertakings of the Brothers\r\nof Common Life, whose work in the manuscript period has already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAs in the earlier manuscript publishing, the Brothers had interested\r\nthemselves particularly in reaching with their books the common people,\r\nand had for this purpose produced their versions in the folk dialects.\r\nWhen, therefore, they had replaced the _scriptoria_ of their Houses\r\nwith well organised printing-offices, they devoted their presses\r\nmainly to the production of devotional books, and of books of general\r\ninstruction planned for the service and information of the middle and\r\nlower classes, and printed in the vernacular.\r\n\r\nWhile I have not found record of the business results secured through\r\nthese printing-offices established by the Brothers, it seems probable,\r\nin view of the excellent distributing machinery they possessed for\r\ntheir output, and from the fact that they were almost the first among\r\nprinters to prepare publications expressly for the use of the lower\r\nand middle classes, that they secured from the sales of their books\r\nsatisfactory business returns, so that the profits produced by their\r\npresses may easily have formed an important part of the resources and\r\nthe income of the Order. Their first printing-presses were established\r\nin Marienthal in 1468, in Brussels and in Rostock in 1476, and in\r\nNuremberg in 1479. In 1490, there were no less than sixty different\r\nprinting establishments carried on under the supervision of the\r\nBrothers. I am not sufficiently familiar with the various phases of\r\nthe complex history of the Reformation to be able to speak definitely\r\nconcerning the influence exercised upon the controversies and the\r\ncontest of the time by the publications of the Brothers. It is my\r\nimpression that these publications remained on the whole orthodox, but\r\nthat they represented the more liberal wing of Catholic Orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nThe city of Leipzig, which a century after the invention of printing\r\nbecame the centre of the book-trade of Germany, and the most important\r\nbook-producing city in the world, began its printing somewhat later\r\nthan the other German cities whose work has already been referred to.\r\n\r\nThe earliest printing-press set up in Leipzig was that of an anonymous\r\nprinter who issued, in 1481, an edition of the essay of the Dominican\r\nAnnius von Viterbo, entitled _Glosa Super Apocalipsim_. The second\r\nLeipzig publication, also issued without imprint, was an edition of the\r\nfifteen astrological propositions of Martin Polich. The first Leipzig\r\npublisher whose name is recorded is Markus Brandis, who issued, in\r\n1484, a volume entitled _Regimen Sanitatis_, which was the work of\r\nArchbishop Albicius of Prague, who had died in 1427. It is not easy\r\nto decide on what basis these first three publications of the future\r\npublishing mart were selected, and it is difficult to understand how\r\na remunerative sale could have been depended upon for any one of the\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1513, the production of Breviaries had become an important\r\ninterest with the Leipzig presses. A printer named Lotter secured\r\na reputation in the earlier years of the sixteenth century for the\r\nexcellence of his typography, and was employed by the Archbishop of\r\nHeller in printing the Breviaries and the Missals of the Dioceses\r\nof Brandenburg. In 1492, a certain Gregor Werman printed _Sacrarum\r\nHistoriarum Opus_. The name of the author does not appear in connection\r\nwith the work. In 1497, Bötticher issued an edition of Virgil’s\r\n_Bucolics_, the first classic which bears a Leipzig imprint.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1495, the book-trade of Leipzig had assumed very\r\nconsiderable proportions, not only in connection with printing and\r\npublishing, but in the organisation of machinery for collecting and\r\ndistributing the publications of other cities. In this branch of the\r\nbook business, Leipzig was already beginning to rival Frankfort. The\r\nbooksellers’ association, organised in 1525, is, at the present time,\r\n370 years later, the most effective and intelligently managed trade\r\norganisation that the world has known. Leipzig publishers gave from an\r\nearly period special attention to the printing of the controversial\r\nliterature of the Reformation, and, as was natural from their close\r\nrelations with Wittenberg, the sympathies of the larger proportion of\r\nthe printers were in accord with the Lutherans.\r\n\r\nUnder the trade restrictions established by Duke George of Saxony, who\r\nwas a Catholic, and whose reign covered the period between 1524 and\r\n1533, the work of the Protestant printers was very seriously hampered,\r\nand the whole book-trade of Leipzig was affected. The writings of the\r\nReformers were repressed as far as practicable by rigorous censorship,\r\nwhile those of the Romanists found few buyers. Lotter, the son of the\r\nfirst printer of that name, removed his printing-office to Wittenberg,\r\nwhere he continued, though still under the difficulties of a rigorous\r\nsupervision, to distribute the writings of the Reformers. The\r\nmagistracy of Leipzig, appreciating the importance of the book-trade,\r\nattempted in the first place to secure for its operations the necessary\r\nprotection. Later, however, it was compelled, under pressure from the\r\nDuke, to put into effect the ducal regulations for supervision and\r\ncensorship, and two ecclesiastical censors, appointed under the ducal\r\nauthority, secured the aid of the city officials in making examination\r\nof the books printed, and in confiscating or cancelling all heretical\r\nworks found in the book-shops of either Leipzig or Dresden.\r\n\r\nUnder the edict issued in 1528, all books printed by Vogel, Goltz, and\r\nSchramm of Wittenberg, were forbidden to be offered for sale in Leipzig\r\nor Dresden, and were forbidden transportation to the Frankfort Fair.\r\nThe immediate result of these anti-reform operations of the Church and\r\nof the Duke was the practical destruction for the time being of the\r\nbook-trade of Leipzig.\r\n\r\nIn 1539, a printer of Leipzig, named Michel Wohlrabe, secured for\r\nhimself notoriety through the extent of his piracy publications. He\r\nissued editions of the Lutheran Bible and of other writings of the\r\nReformers, in the face, not only of the claims of these writers to\r\ncontrol their own publications, but of the prohibition of Duke George\r\nagainst the production of any Lutheran literature whatever. After\r\nthe death of George, however, there came a change in regard to the\r\ninfluence of the ducal government, and at the request of the Elector\r\nJohn Frederic, an edict was issued forbidding the further printing in\r\nLeipzig of any anti-Lutheran literature. This removed one difficulty in\r\nthe way of Wohlrabe’s operations, and Luther and his friends found that\r\nthey were helpless, in the conditions which then obtained in the law\r\nand in the book-trade, to prevent the circulation of these unauthorised\r\neditions.\r\n\r\nLuther’s complaints, referred to further on, were principally directed,\r\nas it must be remembered, not against the loss of profits to himself,\r\nbut to the injury to the community and the grievance to the writers in\r\nhaving books circulated in an unrevised and incorrect text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINTER-PUBLISHERS OF ITALY, 1464-1600.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE reproduction and distribution of the works of classical writers\r\nto such an extent as not only to influence the scholarly thought of\r\nthe time, but to widen enormously the circles of society reached and\r\naffected by intellectual influences, became possible only through the\r\nnew art of printing which had been brought across the Alps by German\r\nworkmen; while the prompt utilisation of printing for the service\r\nof scholarship called for the devoted labour of printers who were\r\nthemselves scholars and who were prepared to subordinate and even to\r\nsacrifice, in the cause of a literary ideal, their immediate business\r\nadvantage. It was to the high scholarly ideals and courageous and\r\nunselfish labours of Aldus Manutius and his immediate successors no\r\nless than to the imagination, ingenuity, and persistency of Gutenberg\r\nand Fust, that the Europe of 1495 was indebted for the great gift of\r\nthe poetry and the philosophy of Greece. Mayence and Venice joined\r\nhands to place at the service of the scholarly world the literary\r\nheritage of Athens.\r\n\r\nThe close of the fifteenth century witnessed a great expansion in\r\nmore than one direction of European thought. In the West, Columbus\r\nhad opened up a new world, and his discovery, while giving manifold\r\nincentives to the men of action, must also have served as a powerful\r\nstimulus to the imagination of the thinkers of the time, in its\r\nsuggestions concerning the possibilities of the future. In the East,\r\nthe printers of Venice were making use of scholars from Constantinople\r\nto rediscover for Europe the vast realm of Greek thought, and to\r\nbring Homer, Plato, and Aristotle to the knowledge of the students of\r\nBologna, Paris, and Oxford. Perhaps in no other epoch of the world’s\r\nhistory has there been so great an expansion of the possibilities\r\nof thought and of action, so suggestive a widening of range of the\r\nimagination, as in the decade succeeding 1492.\r\n\r\nThe introduction into Italy of the art of printing was due to Juan\r\nTurrecremata, who was Abbot of the monastery of Subiaco, and who later\r\nbecame Cardinal. He was a native of Valladolid in Spain, and his family\r\nname was Torquemada, of which name Turrecremata is the Latinised form.\r\nThe Cardinal has been confused by Frommann[447] with the Torquemada who\r\nwas Inquisitor-General of the Inquisition during the period of its most\r\npitiless activity. The latter probably belonged to the same family, but\r\nhis Christian name was Tomas, and he was not born till 1420, thirty\r\nyears later than the Cardinal. Juan Torquemada had, however, been one\r\nof the confessors of Queen Isabella, and was said to have made to her\r\nthe first suggestion of the necessity of establishing the Inquisition,\r\nin order to check the rising spirit of heresy. He did not realise what\r\na Trojan horse, full of heretical possibilities, he was introducing\r\ninto Italy in bringing in the Germans and their printing-press.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of Subiaco was some sixty miles from Rome. Among its\r\nmonks were, in 1464, a number of Germans, some of whom had, before\r\nleaving Germany, seen or heard enough of the work done by the printers\r\nin Mayence or Frankfort to be able to give to the Abbot an idea of\r\nits character. The Abbot was keenly interested in the possibilities\r\npresented by the new art, and with the aid of these German monks\r\nhe arranged to bring to Subiaco two printers, Conrad Schweinheim,\r\nof Mayence, and Arnold Pannartz, of Prague, who were instructed\r\nto organise a printing-office in the monastery. They began their\r\noperations early in 1464, their first work being given to the printing\r\nin sheet form of the manuals of worship or liturgies used in the\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nIn 1465, they published the first volume printed in Italy, an edition\r\nof a Latin syntax for boys, edited by Lactantius. This was followed\r\nin the latter part of the same year by an edition of Cicero’s _De\r\nOratore_, and in 1467, by the _De Civitate_ of Augustine.\r\n\r\nIt was only the enthusiasm of the Abbot that rendered it possible,\r\neven for a short period, to overcome the many obstacles in the way\r\nof carrying on a printing-office in an out of the way village like\r\nSubiaco. But the difficulties soon became too great, and in 1467,\r\nthe two German printers found their way, under the invitation of the\r\nbrothers Massimi, to Rome, where they set up their presses in the\r\nMassimi palace. There they carried on operations for five years,\r\nduring which time they produced a stately series of editions of the\r\nLatin classics, including the works of Cicero, Apuleius, Gellius,\r\nCæsar, Virgil, Livy, Strabo, Lucan, Pliny, Suetonius, Quintilian,\r\nOvid, together with editions of certain of the Church Fathers, such as\r\nAugustine, Jerome, and Cyprian. They also published a Latin Bible, and\r\nthe Bible commentaries of Nicholas de Lyra, in five volumes.\r\n\r\nWith the production of the last work, the resources which had been\r\nplaced at their disposal by their friends the Massimis and by another\r\npatron, Bussi, Bishop of Aleria, were exhausted. The Bishop addressed\r\nan appeal to the Pope on their behalf, setting forth the importance\r\nof their work for the “service of literature and of the Church.”\r\nSixtus IV., who had just succeeded to the papacy, while apparently not\r\naffected by the dread which influenced future popes concerning the\r\npernicious influence of the printing-press, evidently did not share in\r\nthe enthusiasm of the Bishop as to its present value for the Church. He\r\nwas also somewhat avaricious and preferred to use his money to provide\r\nfor a large circle of relatives rather than to support a publishing\r\nbusiness. The printers were, therefore, unable to secure any aid from\r\nthe papal treasury, and, in 1472, they brought their business to a\r\nclose. Schweinheim transferred his activities to the work of engraving\r\non copper, while concerning the further undertakings of Pannartz there\r\nis no record.\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years of their operations in Subiaco and in Rome,\r\nthese two printers, who constituted the first firm of publishers in\r\nItaly, had printed twenty-nine separate works, comprised in thirty-six\r\nvolumes. The editions averaged 275 copies of each volume, the total\r\noutput aggregating about 12,500 volumes. There is no record of any\r\nattempt being made to secure for this first list of publications the\r\nprotection of privileges, and there could in fact have been at the time\r\nno competition to fear.\r\n\r\nShortly after the cessation of Schweinheim’s business, Turrecremata\r\nbecame a cardinal, and he immediately invited another German printer,\r\nUlrich Hahn, from Ingolstadt, to settle in Rome. Hahn’s first\r\npublications were the _Meditationes_ of the Cardinal himself, and\r\nthese were followed by a number of editions of the Latin classics.\r\nThe learned Campanus, Bishop of Teramo, was one of Hahn’s patrons and\r\ngave also valuable service as a press-corrector, working so diligently\r\nthat at one time he reserved for himself only three hours’ sleep. The\r\nBishop writes with great enthusiasm to a friend concerning the art of\r\nprinting, “by means of which material which required a year for its\r\nwriting could be printed off ready for the reader in one day.”\r\n\r\nOther German printers followed Hahn, and before the close of the\r\ncentury more than twenty had carried on work in Rome with varying\r\nsuccess. The influence of the Church was at this time decidedly\r\nfavourable to the new art, and nearly all the Roman printers of the\r\nearlier group were working at the instance of ecclesiastics, and often\r\nwith the direct support of ecclesiastical funds. It is to the Church of\r\nRome, therefore, that belongs the responsibility for the introduction\r\ninto Italy of the printing-press, the work of which was later to give\r\nto the Church so much trouble. The little town of Subiaco can, as the\r\nrecord shows, claim the credit of the first printing, while it was in\r\nRome that the first publications of importance were produced.\r\n\r\nThe leading place, however, in the production of books was almost\r\nfrom the outset taken by the printers of Venice, and as well for the\r\nexcellence of their typography as by reason of the scholarly importance\r\nof the publications themselves, the Venetian printers maintained\r\nfor many years a pre-eminence not only in Italy but in Europe. The\r\ndistinctive prestige secured by Venice came through the printing of\r\nGreek texts, the beginnings of which, under the direction of Aldus\r\nManutius, will be referred to later.\r\n\r\n=Venice.=--The first book printed in Venice was the famous _Decor\r\nPuellarum_, a treatise of instruction for young girls as to the ruling\r\nof their lives. Its date has been claimed by Venetians to be 1461, but\r\nit appears from the judgment of the best authorities that this date\r\nmust have been erroneous and that the volume really appeared in 1471.\r\nThe printer of the _Decor Puellarum_ was Jenson, a Frenchman, and the\r\ncontest for priority in Italian publishing has rested between him and\r\nthe two Germans of Subiaco.\r\n\r\nAnother printer whose first Italian volume, _Epistolæ Familiares_,\r\nappeared in Venice in 1470, was also a German, John of Speyer. A fourth\r\nvolume in this earlier group of publications bore the title _Miracoli\r\ndella Gloriosa Verzine_. This was the only one of the four which was\r\nprinted by an Italian, Lavagna of Milan, while it was also the only\r\nearly printed book in the Italian language.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1493, the earliest official document relating to the\r\nprinting-press in Venice was published by the Abbate Jacopo Morelli,\r\nprefect of the Marcian Library. That document is an order of the\r\n_Collegio_ or cabinet of Venice, dated September 18, 1469. The order\r\nwas proposed by the Doge’s councillors, and grants to John of Speyer,\r\nfor a period of five years, the monopoly of printing in Venice and\r\nin the territory controlled by Venice. John did not long enjoy the\r\nadvantages of this monopoly, having died in 1470, but the business was\r\ncontinued by his brother Windelin, to whom, apparently, was conceded\r\nthe continuance of the monopoly.\r\n\r\nJohn of Speyer was one of the few of the earlier printers who left\r\ninformation concerning the size of their editions. If he had also\r\nthought it important to specify the price at which the books were sold,\r\nwe should have had data for calculations concerning the relative profit\r\nfrom the different works.\r\n\r\nOf the _Epistolæ Familiares_, the first edition comprised but one\r\nhundred copies, but the demand must have been greater than had\r\nbeen calculated for, as four months later the printing of a second\r\nedition of six hundred copies was begun, which was completed (in two\r\nimpressions) within the term of three months.\r\n\r\nThe printer, Nicolas Jenson, was born in the province of Champagne\r\nabout 1420, and was brought up in the Paris Mint. He was sent to\r\nMayence in 1458 by Charles VII. to learn the secrets of the new art of\r\nprinting. He returned to France in 1461, shortly after the accession\r\nof Louis XI. It is not clear whether the new king was less interested\r\nthan had been his predecessor in the development of French printing, or\r\nwhether Jenson was afforded any opportunity for exercising his art in\r\nParis. In 1465, however, he is heard of in Venice, and he began there,\r\nin 1470, a printing and publishing business which soon became the most\r\nimportant in Italy.\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons to influence Jenson in his choice of Venice as\r\nthe scene of his operations. In the first place, the tide of printers\r\nwas flowing steadily towards Italy. Apprentices who had acquired the\r\nnew art in Germany set out to seek their fortunes by the exercise of\r\ntheir skill. It was natural that they should turn to Italy, where the\r\nnobles were rich, where learning had its home, where there were already\r\nmany manuscripts available for the printers, and where there was a\r\npublic, both lay and ecclesiastic, ready to pay for the reproductions.\r\nThe Venetian Republic offered special attractions in the security\r\nafforded by its government, and in the protection and liberty she\r\npromised to all who settled in her dominions. Venice was, moreover, the\r\nbest mart for the distribution of goods, and the trade in paper was\r\nfacilitated by the ease and cheapness of sea-carriage.\r\n\r\nThe first rag paper was made about the year 1300, and the trade of\r\npaper-making soon became an important one in Italy. In 1373, the\r\nVenetian Senate forbade the exportation of rags from the dominions of\r\nthe Republic, an act which recalls the edict of Ptolemy Philadelphus in\r\n290 B.C., forbidding the exportation of papyrus from Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe position of Venice secured for it exceptional facilities for\r\nbecoming a literary and a publishing centre, facilities in some\r\nrespects similar to those which eighteen hundred years earlier had\r\ngiven to Alexandria the control of the book production of its time. The\r\nVenetian Contarini, writing in 1591, speaks of “the wonderful situation\r\nof the city, which possesses so many advantages that one might think\r\nthe site had been selected not by men but by the gods themselves. The\r\ncity lies in a quiet inlet of the Adriatic Sea. On the side towards the\r\nsea, the waters of the lagoons are spread out like a series of lakes,\r\nwhile far in the distance the bow-shaped peninsula of the Lido serves\r\nas a protection against the storms from the south. On the side towards\r\nthe main land, the city is, in like manner, surrounded and protected by\r\nthe waters of its lagoons. Various canals serve as roadways between the\r\ndifferent islands, and in the midst of the lakes and of these watery\r\nways arise in stately groups the palaces and the towers of the city.”\r\n\r\nIt was by the thoroughness of the protection secured for Venice through\r\nits watery defences, no less than by its isolated position outside of,\r\nalthough in immediate connection with, the Italian territory, that\r\nthe Republic was enabled to keep free from a large proportion of the\r\ncontests petty and great that troubled or devastated Italian territory\r\nduring the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhen it was drawn into a conflict, its fighting was done very largely\r\nby means of its fleets, operating at a distance, or with the aid of\r\nforeign troops hired for the purpose, and but rarely were the actual\r\noperations of war brought within touch of Venetian territory. Its\r\ncontrol of the approaches by sea prevented also the connections with\r\nthe outer world from being interfered with. The city could neither\r\nbe blockaded nor surrounded, and in whatever warlike operations it\r\nmight be engaged, its commercial undertakings went on practically\r\nundisturbed. It was under very similar conditions that Alexandria\r\nsecured, in literary production and in publishing operations during the\r\nfourth and the third centuries B.C., pre-eminence over Pergamus and\r\nthe other Greek cities of Asia Minor. The fact that manuscripts and\r\nprinting-presses could be fairly protected against the risks of war,\r\nand that the road to the markets of the world for the productions of\r\nthe presses could not easily be blocked, had an important influence\r\nduring the century succeeding 1490, in attracting printers to Venice\r\nrather than to Bologna, Milan, or Florence. The Venetian government was\r\nalso prompt to recognise the value of the new industry and the service\r\nand the prestige that were being conferred upon the city by the work of\r\nthe printer-publishers and their scholarly editors. The Republic gave,\r\nfrom the outset, more care to the furthering of this work by privileges\r\nand concessions and by honourable recognition of the guild of the\r\nprinters than was given in any other Italian state. To these advantages\r\nshould be added the valuable relations possessed by Venice with the\r\nscholars of the Greek world, through its old-time connections with\r\nConstantinople and Asia Minor. It was through these connections that\r\nthe printers of Venice secured what might be called the first pick of\r\nthe manuscripts of a large number of the Greek texts that became known\r\nto Europe during the half-century succeeding 1490.\r\n\r\nThese texts were brought in part from the monasteries, which had been\r\nspared by the Turkish conquerors in the Byzantine territory and in Asia\r\nMinor, while in other cases, they came to light in various corners of\r\nItaly, where the scholars, flying from Constantinople after the great\r\ndisaster of 1453, had found refuge. As it became known that in Venice\r\nthere was demand for Greek manuscripts, and that Venetian printers\r\nwere offering compensation to scholars for editing Greek texts for the\r\npress, scholars speedily found their way to the City of the Lagoons.\r\nTo many of these scholars, who had been driven impoverished from their\r\nhomes in the East, the opportunity of securing a livelihood through the\r\nsale and through the editing of their manuscripts must have opened up\r\nnew and important possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn 1479, Jenson sold to Andrea Torresano of Asola, later the\r\nfather-in-law of Aldus Manutius, a set of the matrices punched by his\r\npunches. These matrices were probably the beginning of the plant of the\r\nlater business of Aldus. In 1479, Pope Sixtus IV. conferred upon Jenson\r\nthe honourary title of Count Palatine. He was the first nobleman in\r\nthe guild of publishers, and he has had but few successors. He died in\r\n1480.\r\n\r\nJohn of Windelin, John of Speyer, and Nicolas Jenson, the three\r\nearliest Venetian printers, employed three kinds of characters in\r\ntheir type--Roman, Gothic, and Greek. The Gothic character secured, as\r\ncompared with the others, a considerable economy of space, and its use\r\nbecame, therefore, more general in connection with the increased demand\r\nfrom the reading public for less expensive editions. Before the Greek\r\nfonts had been made, it was customary to leave blanks in the text where\r\nthe Greek passages occurred and to fill these in by hand.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice of the later printer-publishers to place in\r\ntheir books the date, place of publication, and their own names, and\r\nconsidering how much the editing, printing, and publication of a\r\nbook involved, it was natural that those who were responsible for it\r\nshould be interested in securing the full credit for its production.\r\nIt is nevertheless the case that quite a number of books, of no little\r\nimportance, were issued by the earlier printers without any imprint\r\nor mark of origin, an omission which, as Brown remarks, is certainly\r\nsurprising in view of the high esteem in which printers were held and\r\nof the large claims made by them upon the gratitude of their own age\r\nand of future generations.\r\n\r\nThe larger proportion of the outlay required for these early books\r\nwas not the expense of the manufacturing, heavy as this was, but the\r\npayments required for the purchase of manuscripts, and for their\r\nrevision, collation, correction, and preparation for the type-setters.\r\n\r\nThe printer-publisher needed to possess a fair measure of scholarly\r\nknowledge in order to be able to judge rightly of the nature of the\r\neditorial work that was required before the work of the type-setters\r\ncould begin. If, as in the case of Aldus, this scholarly knowledge was\r\nsufficient to enable the printer himself to act as editor, to revise\r\nthe manuscripts for the press, and to write the introduction and the\r\ncritical annotations, he had of course a very great advantage in the\r\nconduct of his business.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the cost of printing in Venice at this period, Brown\r\ncites an agreement entered into in 1478 between a certain Leonardus,\r\nprinter, and Nicolaus, who took the risk of the undertaking, acting,\r\ntherefore, as a publisher. An edition of 930 copies of the complete\r\nBible was to be printed by Leonardus for the price of 430 ducats,\r\nthe paper being furnished by Nicolaus. Twenty of the copies were to\r\nbe retained by Leonardus, and the cost to Nicolaus of the 910 copies\r\nreceived by him would have been, exclusive of the paper, about $2150,\r\nor per copy about $2.50. The cost of the paper would have brought the\r\namount up to about $3. The selling price of Bibles in 1492 appears to\r\nhave varied from 6 ducats to 12 ducats, or from $30 to $60, but it is\r\nprobable that these prices covered various styles of bindings.\r\n\r\nThe years between 1470 and 1515 witnessed a greater increase in the\r\nnumber of printers at work in Venice, a considerable proportion of\r\nthe newcomers being Germans. With the rapid growth in the production\r\nof books, there came a material deterioration in the quality of\r\nthe typography. The original models for the type-founders had\r\nbeen the letters of the manuscripts, and it was the boast of the\r\nearlier founders that their type was so perfect that it could not\r\nbe distinguished from script. The copyists realised that their art\r\nwas in danger, and, in 1474, they went so far in their opposition in\r\nGenoa as to petition the Senate for the expulsion of the printers. The\r\napplication was, however, disregarded; the new art met at once with a\r\ncordial reception, and from the beginning secured the active support of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe trade of the printers could, however, not rest upon a secure\r\nfoundation until the taste for reading had become popularised.\r\nThe wealthy classes were not sufficiently numerous to keep the\r\nprinting-presses busy, while it was also the case that for a number of\r\nyears after the invention of printing, a considerable proportion of the\r\nwealthier collectors of literature continued to give their preference\r\nto manuscripts as being more aristocratic and exclusive. The earlier\r\nbooks issued from the presses were planned to meet the requirements\r\nof these higher class collectors, whose taste had been formed from\r\nbeautiful manuscripts. With the second generation of printers, however,\r\na new market arose calling for a different class of supplies. The\r\nrevival of learning brought into existence a reading public which was\r\neager for knowledge and which was no longer fastidious as to the beauty\r\nof the form in which its literature was presented. By 1490, a demand\r\nhad arisen for cheap books for popular reading, and in changing their\r\nmethods to meet this demand, the printers permitted the standard of\r\nexcellence of their work to suffer a material decline.\r\n\r\nBrown gives an abstract from the day-book of a Venetian bookseller of\r\n1484-1485, the original of which is contained in the Marcian Library.\r\nEven at that early date, we find represented in the stock of the\r\nbookseller, classics, Bibles, missals, breviaries, works on canon law,\r\nschool-books, romances, and poetry.\r\n\r\nThe record shows that the purchases of the bookseller from the\r\npublisher were usually made for cash, and that for the most part he\r\nreceived cash from his customers. In some cases, however, these latter\r\nmade their payment in kind. Thus a chronicle was exchanged for oil;\r\nCicero’s _Orations_ for wine; and a general assortment of books for\r\nflour; while different binders’ bills were settled, the one with the\r\n_Life and Miracles of the Madonna_, and the other with the series of\r\nthe _Hundred Novels_. The proof-reader was paid for certain services\r\nwith copies of a Mamotrictus, a Legendary, and a Bible, and an account\r\nfrom an illuminator was adjusted with an Abacus, (a multiplication\r\ntable, or a condensed arithmetic).\r\n\r\nThe prices of books ruled lower than might have been expected, the\r\ncheapest being volumes of poetry and romance. For instance, Poggio’s\r\n_Facetiæ_ sells for nine soldi, and the _Inamoramento d’Orlando_ for\r\none lira, while Dante’s _Inferno_ with a commentary, brings one ducat,\r\nand Plutarch’s _Lives_, two ducats. A small volume of Martial brought\r\nfifteen soldi. The editions of certain printers realised higher prices\r\nthan those of the same books by other printers whose imprint did not\r\ncarry with it so much prestige.\r\n\r\nIt was during the last ten years of the fifteenth century that the\r\nbusiness of printing and publishing in Venice reached its highest\r\nimportance as compared with that done elsewhere. It was this decade\r\nthat witnessed the founding of the Greek press by Aldus, Vlastos,\r\nand Caliergi, the first printing in Arabic and in the other Eastern\r\nlanguages, and the beginning of the publication of romances and\r\n_novelieri_.\r\n\r\nThe part taken in these new undertakings by Aldus Manutius was of\r\ndistinctive importance, not only for Venice and Italy, but for the\r\ncivilised world. He was a skilled printer, and an enterprising,\r\npublic-spirited publisher, and he was, further, a judicious and\r\npainstaking critic and editor, and a scholar of exceptional\r\nattainments. To him more than to any other one man is due the\r\nintroduction into Europe of the literature of Greece, which was\r\nin a measure rediscovered at the time, when, by the use of the\r\nprinting-press, it could be placed within the reach of wide circles of\r\nimpecunious students to whom the purchase of costly manuscripts would\r\nhave been impossible.\r\n\r\nIn his interest in Greek literature, as well as in his scholarship\r\nand public-spirited liberality, Aldus was a worthy successor to the\r\nRoman publisher of the first century who had earned the appellation of\r\nAtticus on account of the attention given by him to the reproduction\r\nfor the reading public of Italy of the great classics of Greece.\r\nAtticus was, however, a man of large means, gained chiefly through his\r\nbusiness as a banker and a farmer of taxes, and it appears to have\r\nbeen to him a matter of indifference whether or not his publishing\r\nundertakings returned any profits on the moneys invested in them. Aldus\r\nbegan business without capital and died a poor man. Not many of his\r\nbooks secured for the publisher profits as well as prestige. He lived\r\nmodestly and laboured continuously, but he expended in fresh scholarly\r\npublishing undertakings all the receipts that came to him from such of\r\nhis ventures as proved remunerative.\r\n\r\nAs before pointed out, the payments made by Aldus for the work of\r\nediting his series of classical publications, payments which were\r\nprobably the first ever made in Italy for literary work in connection\r\nwith printing, were not only of material service to many of the\r\nimpecunious Greek scholars, but must have served as precedents for\r\nfixing, for Italy at least, a market value for literary service.\r\nThe payments to the Greek refugees included in a number of cases\r\ncompensation for the use of the manuscripts they had brought with them,\r\nmanuscripts which not infrequently constituted practically everything\r\nin the shape of property that they had been able to save from the grasp\r\nof the Turks. For a number of the more scholarly of these refugees,\r\nplaces were made in the universities, or as we should now say, Chairs\r\nwere endowed, for instruction in the language and literature of Greece.\r\nAldus himself took the initiative in inducing the Venetian Senate to\r\ninstitute such a professorship in Padua for his friend Musurus.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, a larger proportion of the scholars and the\r\nmanuscripts was absorbed by Venice than by any other of the Italian\r\ncities. The production of books progressed more rapidly in Venice\r\nthan elsewhere, and the art of bookmaking reached a higher perfection\r\nthere during the first decade of the sixteenth century than in any\r\ncity in Europe. As before noted, however, Subiaco had preceded Venice\r\nin the printing of books, while the use of Greek type, in which\r\nVenice so rapidly attained pre-eminence, occurred first in Milan. The\r\nintroduction of illustrations into book-printing probably originated in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n=Aldus Manutius.=--It seems to me in order, for the purpose of my\r\nnarrative, to present in some detail the record of the life and work\r\nof Aldus. The history of any representative printer-publisher whose\r\ncareer belonged to the earlier stages of the business of making and\r\nselling books, would have value in throwing light on the extent of\r\nthe difficulties and obstacles to be overcome and on the nature of\r\nthe methods adopted; the career of Aldus possesses, however, not\r\nmerely such typical value but a distinctive and individual interest,\r\nas well because of the personality of the man as on the ground of\r\nthe exceptional importance, for his own community and for future\r\ngenerations, of the service rendered by him.\r\n\r\nAldus Manutius was born at Bassiano in the Romagna, in 1450, the year\r\nin which Gutenberg completed his printing-press. He studied in Rome\r\nand in Ferrara, and after having mastered Latin, he devoted himself,\r\nunder the tutorship of Guarini of Verona, to the study of Greek. Later,\r\nhe delivered lectures on the Latin and Greek classics. One of his\r\nfellow students in Ferrara was the precocious young scholar Pico della\r\nMirandola, whose friendship was afterwards of material service. In\r\n1482, when Ferrara was being besieged by the Venetians and scholarly\r\npursuits were interrupted, Aldus was the guest of Pico at Mirandola,\r\nwhere he met Emanuel Adramyttenos, one of the many Greek scholars who,\r\nwhen driven out of Constantinople, had found refuge in the Courts\r\nof Italian princes. Aldus spent two years at Mirandola, and under\r\nthe influence and guidance of Adramyttenos, he largely increased his\r\nknowledge of the language and literature of Greece. His friend had\r\nbrought from the East a number of manuscripts, many of which found\r\ntheir way into the library of Pico.\r\n\r\nIn 1482, Aldus took charge of the education of the sons of the Princess\r\nof Carpi, a sister of Pico, and the zeal and scholarly capacity which\r\nhe devoted to his task won for him the life-long friendship of both\r\nmother and sons. It was in Carpi that Aldus developed the scheme of\r\nutilising his scholarly knowledge and connections for the printing of\r\nLatin and Greek classics. The plan was a bold one for a young scholar\r\nwithout capital. Printing and publishing constituted a practically\r\nuntried field of business, not merely for Aldus but for Italy.\r\nEverything had to be created or developed; knowledge of the art of\r\nprinting and of all the technicalities of book-manufacturing; fonts of\r\ntype, Roman and Greek; a force of type-setters and pressmen and a staff\r\nof skilled revisers and proof-readers; a collection of trustworthy\r\ntexts to serve as “copy” for the compositors; and last, but by no means\r\nleast, a book-buying public and a book-selling machinery by which such\r\npublic could be reached.\r\n\r\nIt was the aim of Aldus, as he himself expressed it, to rescue from\r\noblivion the words of the classic writers, the monuments of human\r\nintellect. He writes in 1490: “I have resolved to devote my life\r\nto the cause of scholarship. I have chosen in place of a life of\r\nease and freedom, an anxious and toilsome career. A man has higher\r\nresponsibilities than the seeking of his own enjoyment; he should\r\ndevote himself to honourable labour. Living that is a mere existence\r\ncan be left to men who are content to be animals. Cato compared human\r\nexistence to iron. When nothing is done with it, it rusts; it is only\r\nthrough constant activity that polish or brilliancy is secured.” The\r\nworld has probably never produced a publisher who united with these\r\nhigh ideals and exceptional scholarly attainments, so much practical\r\nbusiness ability and persistent pluck.\r\n\r\nThe funds required for the undertaking were furnished by the Princess\r\nof Carpi and her sons, probably with some co-operation from Pico, and\r\nin 1494, Aldus organised his printing-office in Venice. His first\r\npublication, issued in 1495, was the Greek and Latin Grammar of\r\nLaskaris, a suitable forerunner for his great classical series. The\r\nsecond issue from his Press was an edition of the Works of Aristotle,\r\nthe first volume of which was also completed in 1495. This was followed\r\nin 1496 by the Greek Grammar of Gaza, and in 1497 by a Greek-Latin\r\nDictionary compiled by Aldus himself.\r\n\r\nThe business cares of these first years of his printing business were\r\nnot allowed to prevent him from going on with his personal studies.\r\nIn 1502, he published, in a handsome quarto volume, a comprehensive\r\ngrammar under the title of _Rudimenta Grammatices Linguæ Latinæ, etc.\r\ncum Introductione ad Hebraicam Linguam_, to the preparation of which he\r\nhad devoted years of arduous labour. Piratical editions were promptly\r\nissued in Florence, Lyons, and Paris. He also wrote the _Grammaticæ\r\nInstitutiones Græcæ_ (a labour of some years), which was not published\r\nuntil 1515, after the death of the author.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that nearly all the undertakings to which he gave,\r\nboth as editor and as publisher, his earliest attention, were the\r\nnecessary first steps in the great scheme of the reproduction of the\r\ncomplete series of the Greek classics. Before editors or proof-readers\r\ncould go on with the work of preparing the Greek texts for the press,\r\ndictionaries and grammars had to be created. Laskaris, whose Grammar\r\ninitiated the series, was a refugee from the East, and at the time of\r\nthe publication of his work, was an instructor in Messina. No record\r\nhas been preserved of the arrangement made with him by his Venetian\r\npublisher, a deficiency that is the more to be regretted as his Grammar\r\nwas probably the very first work by a living author, printed in Italy.\r\nGaza was a native of Greece, and was for a time associated with the\r\nAldine Press as a Greek editor.\r\n\r\nIn 1500, Aldus married the daughter of the printer Andrea Torresano of\r\nAsola, previously referred to as the successor of the Frenchman Jenson\r\nand the purchaser of Jenson’s matrices. In 1507, the two printing\r\nconcerns were united, and the savings of Torresano were utilised to\r\nstrengthen the resources of Aldus, which had become impaired, probably\r\nthrough his too great optimism and publishing enterprise.\r\n\r\nDuring the disastrous years of 1509-1511, in which Venice was harassed\r\nby the wars resulting from the League of Cambray, the business came\r\nto a stand-still, partly because the channels of distribution for\r\nthe books were practically blocked, but partly also on account of\r\nthe exhaustion of the available funds. Friends again brought to the\r\npublisher the aid to which, on the ground of his public-spirited\r\nundertakings, he was so well entitled, and he was enabled, after the\r\npeace of 1511, to proceed with the completion of his Greek classics.\r\nBefore his death in 1515, Aldus had issued in this series the works of\r\nAristotle, Plato, Homer, Pindar, Euripides, Sophocles, Aristophanes,\r\nDemosthenes, Lysias, Æschines, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon,\r\nPlutarch, and others, in addition to a companion series of the works of\r\nthe chief Latin writers. The list of publications included in all some\r\n100 different works, comprised (in their several editions) in about\r\n250 volumes. Considering the special difficulties of the times and the\r\nexceptional character of the original and creative labour that was\r\nrequired to secure the texts, to prepare them for the press, to print\r\nthem correctly, and to bring them to the attention of possible buyers,\r\nthis list of undertakings is, in my judgment, by far the greatest and\r\nthe most honourable in the whole history of publishing.\r\n\r\nIt was a disadvantage for carrying on scholarly publishing undertakings\r\nin Venice, that the city possessed no university, a disadvantage that\r\nwas only partly offset by the proximity of Padua, which early in the\r\nfifteenth century had come under Venetian rule. A university would of\r\ncourse have been of service to a publisher like Aldus, not only in\r\nsupplying a home market for his books, but in placing at his disposal\r\nscholarly assistants whose services could be utilised in editing the\r\ntexts and in supervising their type-setting. The correspondence of\r\nmembers of a university with the scholars of other centres of learning,\r\ncould be made valuable also in securing information as to available\r\nmanuscripts and concerning scholarly undertakings generally. In the\r\nabsence of a university circle, Aldus was obliged to depend upon his\r\npersonal efforts to bring him into relations, through correspondence,\r\nwith men of learning throughout Europe, and to gather about the Aldine\r\nPress a group of scholarly associates and collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe chief corrector or proof-reader for Greek work of the Press was\r\nJohn Gregoropoulos, of Candia. Some editorial service was rendered by\r\nTheodore Gaza, of Athens, who took part, for instance, in the work\r\non the set of _Aristotle_. The most important, however, of the Greek\r\nassociates of Aldus was Marcus Musurus, of Crete, whose name appears\r\nas the editor of the _Aristophanes_, _Athenæus_, _Plato_, and a number\r\nof other of the Greek authors in the Aldine series, and also of the\r\nimportant collection of _Epistolæ Græcarum_.\r\n\r\nMusurus was an early friend of Pico, and later of his nephew, Alberto\r\nPio, and it was at Carpi that he had first met Aldus, with whom he\r\never afterwards maintained a close intimacy. In 1502, probably at the\r\ninstance of Aldus, Musurus was called by the Venetian Senate to occupy\r\nthe Chair of belles-lettres at Padua, and he appears to have given his\r\nlectures not only in the University, but also in Venice. Aldus writes:\r\n“Scholars hasten to Venice, the Athens of our day, to listen to the\r\nteachings of Musurus, the greatest scholar of the age.”\r\n\r\nIn 1503, the Senate charged Musurus with the task of exercising a\r\ncensorship over all Greek books printed in Venice, with reference\r\nparticularly to the suppression of anything inimical to the Roman\r\nChurch. This seems to have been the earliest attempt in Italy to\r\nsupervise the work of the printing-press. It is natural enough that the\r\necclesiastics should have dreaded the influence of the introduction\r\nof the doctrines of the Greek Church, while it is certainly probable\r\nthat many of the refugees from Constantinople brought with them no\r\nvery cordial feeling towards Rome. The belief was very general that\r\nif the Papacy had not felt a greater enmity against the Greek Church\r\nthan against the Turk, the Catholic states of Europe would have saved\r\nConstantinople. The sacking of Constantinople by the Christian armies\r\nof the Fourth Crusade was still remembered by the Christians of the\r\nEast as a crime of the Western Church. There were, therefore, reasons\r\nenough why the authorities of Rome should think it necessary to keep\r\na close watch over the new literature coming in from the East, and\r\nshould do what was practicable to exclude all doctrinal writings, and\r\nthe censorship instituted in 1502 was the beginning of a long series\r\nof rigorous enactments which proved, however, much less practicable to\r\ncarry out in Venice than elsewhere in Italy.\r\n\r\nOther literary advisers and associates of Aldus were Hieronymus\r\nAlexander (later Cardinal), Pietro Bembo, Scipio Carteromachus,\r\nDemetrius Doucas, Johann Reuchlin, and, above all, Erasmus of\r\nRotterdam, whose learning rivalled that of Musurus, and who, outside of\r\nItaly, was far more widely known than the Greek scholar.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1500 that the scheme took shape in the mind of Aldus\r\nof an academy which should take the place in Venice that in Florence\r\nwas occupied by the academy instituted by the Medici. The special aim\r\nof the Aldine Academy, to which Aldus gave the name _Ne-accademia\r\nNostra_, was the furthering of the interest in, and knowledge of, the\r\nliterature of classic Greece. Aldus himself was the first president\r\nof the Academy, and while the majority of the members were residents\r\neither of Venice or of Padua, the original list included scholars of\r\nRome, of Bologna, and of Lucca, Greeks of Candia, Erasmus of Rotterdam,\r\nand others from distant places.\r\n\r\nAldus applied to the Emperor Maximilian for a diploma giving imperial\r\nsanction to the organisation of his Academy, but the Emperor, although,\r\nas is shown in other correspondence, friendly in his disposition to the\r\nprinter, was from some cause unwilling to give an official recognition\r\nto the Academy. The constitution of the Academy was printed in Greek,\r\nand certain days were fixed on which the members gave their personal\r\nconsideration to the examination of Greek texts, the publication of\r\nwhich was judged likely to be of service to scholarship.\r\n\r\nWith the editorial aid of certain members of the Academy, Aldus\r\narranged to print each month, in an edition of one thousand copies,\r\nsome work selected by the Council. This Council, therefore, took\r\nupon itself in the matter of the selection of Greek classics for\r\npresentation, a function similar to that exercised 300 B.C. by\r\nthe scholars appointed for the purpose in the Academy of Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, while some of its functions might be paralleled by those\r\nexercised to-day by the Delegates of the Clarendon Press of Oxford. It\r\nwas the hope of Aldus that this Venetian Academy would take upon itself\r\nlarger responsibilities in connection not only with Greek literature\r\nbut with arts and sciences generally. When, however, with the death\r\nof its president, the Academy lost the service of his energetic\r\ninitiative, its work soon came to a close.\r\n\r\nFor the sale of his publications, Aldus was in the main dependent\r\nupon direct correspondence with scholars. In Italy prior to 1550,\r\nbookselling hardly existed as an organised trade, and while in Germany\r\nthere was a larger number of dealers in books, and the book-trade had\r\nby 1510 already organised its Fair at Frankfort, the communications\r\nbetween Italy and Germany were still too difficult to enable a\r\npublisher in Venice to keep in regular relations with the dealers\r\nnorth of the Alps. Paris was probably easier to reach than Frankfort,\r\nbut the sales in Paris were not a little interfered with by the Lyons\r\npiracy editions before referred to, and even by piracies of the Paris\r\npublishers themselves. Aldus succeeded, however, before his death\r\nin securing agents who were prepared to take orders for the Aldine\r\nclassics, not only in Paris, but in Vienna, Basel, Augsburg, and\r\nNuremberg. With Frankfort he appears to have had no direct dealings, as\r\nhis name does not appear in the list of contributors to the recently\r\ninstituted Book-Fair.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a business letter of the time, the following lines\r\nfrom a bookseller in Treviso, who wanted to buy books on credit, are\r\nworth quoting:\r\n\r\n  _Alde, libros quos venales bene credere possis\r\n  Hic pollet multa bibliopola fide.\r\n  Fortunis pollet quantum illa negotia possunt;\r\n  Hoc me, Manuti, credere teste potes!\r\n  Ignoras qui sim, nec adhuc sine pignore credis;\r\n  Te meus erga ingens sit tibi pignus amor._\r\n\r\n(You have books for sale, Aldus, which you are able to entrust to me,\r\nif as a dealer, you have sufficient faith. This confidence would secure\r\nfor you as much business advantage as is possible in such transactions.\r\nYou can accept in this matter my personal word. You do not know who I\r\nam, and do not make a practice of giving credit. My great regard for\r\nyou should, however, serve as a sufficient pledge.)[448]\r\n\r\nThe business of the time was done very largely by personal\r\ncorrespondence, and as the knowledge of his editions of the Greek\r\nclassics came to be spread abroad, Aldus found himself overburdened\r\nwith enquiries calling for personal replies. In order to save time\r\nin replying to such enquiries, Aldus printed on a folio sheet the\r\ndescriptive titles of his publications with the prices at which they\r\nwere offered. This sheet, printed in 1498, was the first priced\r\ncatalogue ever issued by a publisher.\r\n\r\nThe orders that came to Aldus for his books differed in one important\r\nrespect from those received by a publisher or bookseller to-day. The\r\nbuyers did not write as a matter of ordinary business routine, or as if\r\nthey were conferring any favour upon the publisher in taking his goods,\r\nbut with a very cordial sense of the personal obligation that the\r\npublisher was, through his undertakings, conferring upon them and upon\r\nall scholarly persons. As an example of many such letters, I will quote\r\nfrom one written in 1505, from a Cistercian monastery in the Thuringian\r\nForest, by a scholarly monk named Urbanus:\r\n\r\n“May the blessing of the Lord rest upon thee, thou illustrious man. The\r\nhigh reward in which you are held by our Brotherhood will be realised\r\nby you when you learn that we have ordered (through the house of Függer\r\nin Augsburg) a group of your valuable publications, and that it is our\r\nchief desire to be able to purchase all the others. We pray to God\r\neach day that He will in His mercy, long preserve you for the cause of\r\ngood learning. Our neighbour, Mutianus Rufus, the learned Canonicus\r\nof Gotha, calls you ‘the light of our age,’ and is never weary of\r\nrelating your great services to scholarship. He sends you a cordial\r\ngreeting, as does also Magister Spalatinus, a man of great learning. We\r\nare sending you with this four gold ducats, and will ask you to send\r\nus (through Függer) an _Etymologicum Magnum_ and a _Julius Pollux_,\r\nand also (if there be money sufficient) the writings of Bessarion, of\r\nXenophon, and of Hierocles, and the Letters of Merula.”[449]\r\n\r\nTroublesome as Aldus found his correspondence, letters of this kind\r\nmust have been peculiarly gratifying as evidence that his labours were\r\nnot in vain.\r\n\r\nHe had similar correspondence with the well-known scholar, Reuchlin,\r\nan appreciative friend and a grateful customer, who in 1501, at the\r\ntime of the first letters, was resident in Heidelberg, and also with\r\nLonginus and the poet Conrad Celtes in Vienna. The latter was later of\r\nservice to Aldus in securing for his Press valuable manuscripts from\r\nBohemia, and from certain monasteries in Transylvania. The name of\r\nCeltes is further of note in the literary history of Germany because to\r\nhim was issued the earliest German privilege of which there is record.\r\nIt bears date 1501, and protected the publication of an edition by\r\nCeltes of the writings of the Benedictine nun Hroswitha (Helena von\r\nRossow), who had been dead for 600 years.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the transalpine scholars with whom Aldus came into\r\nrelations was, however, Desiderius Erasmus, of Rotterdam, or to speak\r\nwith more precision, of Europe. Erasmus has many titles to fame,\r\nbut for the purposes of this treatise his career is noteworthy more\r\nparticularly because he was one of the first authors who was able to\r\nsecure his living, or the more important portion of this, from the\r\nproceeds of his writings. The career of Erasmus belongs properly to\r\nthe chapter on Germany, as it was in Basel, at that time a city of\r\nthe Empire, that he made his longest sojourn, in close association\r\nwith his life-long friend Froben, the scholarly publisher whom Erasmus\r\ncalled the “Aldus of Germany.”\r\n\r\nIn 1506, Erasmus, who had been in England for a second visit, came to\r\nItaly, where he lectured in the Universities of Bologna and Padua,\r\nand from Padua he was induced by Aldus to transfer himself to Venice.\r\nThere he remained during the year 1508, making his home with the\r\npublisher, and rendering important service as a literary adviser and in\r\neditorial work. There is no record of any formal or continued business\r\narrangement between the scholar and the publisher, and it is very\r\npossible that no such arrangement took shape.\r\n\r\nErasmus took charge of the preparation for the press, among other\r\nworks, of the Aldine editions of _Terence_, _Seneca_, Plutarch’s\r\n_Morals_, and _Plautus_. For his work on the _Plautus_ he tells us that\r\nhe received twenty pieces of gold (_i. e._, ducats). Later, however,\r\nhe denied with some indignation, in writing to Scaliger, that he had\r\nworked as a “corrector” or proof-reader for Aldus. It should be borne\r\nin mind that in connection with the many difficulties in securing from\r\nmore or less doubtful manuscripts trustworthy texts, and in educating\r\ncompositors to put such texts correctly into type, the work of reviser,\r\npress-corrector, or proof-reader, in the earlier days of printing,\r\ndemanded a very high standard of scholarship and a wide range of\r\nknowledge. There was, therefore, no reason why Erasmus should have been\r\nashamed to admit that he had done work of this kind. Some years later\r\nhe gave to his friend Froben, the great publisher of Basel, similar\r\nservice and co-operation. The intimate relations of Erasmus with Aldus\r\nand Froben, by far the greatest publishers of the time, had no little\r\ninfluence in furthering the world-wide circulation secured for his\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nWhile in Venice, Erasmus also supervised the printing of a revised\r\nedition of his _Adagia_ (Proverbs) which appeared in 1508. For this\r\nwork, Aldus obtained a privilege both in Venice and in Rome, and there\r\nwere printed in Venice alone eight editions. When, however, in 1520,\r\nPaul Manutius undertook again to reprint the _Adagia_, he found that he\r\nhad to contend with an increasing hostility on the part of the Church\r\nagainst anything bearing the name of Erasmus. The book was finally\r\nissued anonymously, and it was described in the catalogue as the work\r\nof “_Batavus quidam homo_” (a certain Hollander).\r\n\r\nIn 1512, Aldus printed, under the instructions of Erasmus, (who was,\r\nhowever, at that time no longer in Italy) the _Colloquies_ and the\r\n_Praise of Folly_. There is unfortunately no record of the publishing\r\narrangement arrived at for these, but as Erasmus complained bitterly of\r\nthe loss and injury caused to the author through the wide sale of the\r\npiracy issues, it is fair to assume that he had reserved an interest in\r\nthe authorised editions. In the introduction to his _Adagia_, Erasmus\r\nwrites as follows: “Formerly there was devoted to the correctness of\r\na literary manuscript as much care and attention as to the writing\r\nof a notarial instrument. Such care and precision were held to be\r\na sacred duty. Later, the copying of manuscripts was entrusted to\r\nignorant monks and even to women. But how much more serious is the\r\nevil that can be brought about by a careless printer, and yet to this\r\nmatter the law gives no heed. A dealer who sells English stuffs under\r\nthe guise of Venetian is punished, but the printer who in place of\r\ncorrect texts, misleads and abuses the reader with pages the contents\r\nof which are an actual trial and torment, escapes unharmed. It is\r\nfor this reason that Germany is plagued with so many books that are\r\ndeformed (_i. e._, untrustworthy). The authorities will supervise with\r\narbitrary regulations the proper methods for the baking of bread, but\r\nconcern themselves not at all as to the correctness of the work of\r\nthe printers, although the influence of bad typography is far more\r\ninjurious than that of bad bread.”\r\n\r\nThe relations of Aldus with Johann Reuchlin were longer and more\r\nintimate than with Erasmus. It was natural enough that the scholar\r\nwho may properly be called the founder of Greek studies in Germany,\r\nshould have come into close relations with the publisher who had\r\nundertaken to produce Greek texts for Europe and who had founded a\r\nGreek academy in Venice. In 1498, Aldus printed the Latin oration which\r\nReuchlin had addressed to Pope Alexander VI., in behalf of the Prince\r\nPalatine Philip, and from that date the two men remained in regular\r\ncorrespondence with each other. In 1502, Aldus, writing to Reuchlin\r\n(who was at that time in Pforzheim), gives, as to a trusted friend upon\r\nwhose sympathy and intelligent interest he could depend, the details of\r\nhis publishing undertakings and of his plans and hopes for the future,\r\nand asks for counsel on various points. A few months later, in another\r\nletter, Aldus writes:\r\n\r\n“I am hardly able to express my gratification at your friendly words\r\nconcerning the importance and the value of my publishing undertakings.\r\nIt is no light thing to secure the commendation of one of the greatest\r\nscholars of his time. If my life is spared to me, I hope more fully\r\nto deserve the praise that you give to me for service rendered to the\r\nscholarship and enlightenment of the age.”\r\n\r\nReuchlin was not only a friendly counsellor of the Venetian publisher,\r\nbut a valuable customer also for his books. In addition to purchasing\r\nfor his own library a full series of the Aldine editions, Reuchlin\r\nappears to have interested himself keenly in commending these to his\r\nscholarly acquaintances, not only, as he states, in order to encourage\r\na great undertaking, but for the purpose of doing service to German\r\nstudents. In 1509, Reuchlin was appointed by the Duke of Bavaria,\r\nProfessor of Greek and Hebrew in the University of Ingolstadt, the\r\nfirst professorship of Greek instituted in Germany. Reuchlin said\r\nmore than once that the work of his Chair had been made possible only\r\nthrough the service rendered by Aldus in providing the Greek texts.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Aldus not only on the publishing standards but on the\r\nscholarly and literary conditions of Germany, was in fact widespread\r\nand important. Kapp, the historian of the German book-trade, speaks\r\nof it as more important than that of all the German publishers of\r\nhis generation. This influence was due not only to the publishing\r\nundertakings of the Aldine Press, but to the intimate relations\r\nmaintained by its founder with many of the German scholars, relations\r\nwhich helped to establish a community of interests between the literary\r\ncentres of Italy and Germany and to direct German scholarship into new\r\npaths. The separation of political boundaries had no significance for\r\na man with the humanitarian ideals of Aldus, while the fact that Latin\r\nwas the universal language of scholarship and of literature, helped not\r\na little to bring about that community of feeling among scholars which\r\nwas the special aim of the Venetian publisher. In 1502, Aldus writes to\r\nJohn Taberio, in Brescia:\r\n\r\n“I am delighted to learn that so many men of distinction in the great\r\ncity of Brescia are, under your guidance, devoting themselves with\r\nardour to Greek studies. The expectations with which I undertook the\r\npublication of Greek texts are being more than realised. I am, in fact,\r\nnot a little astonished to find that even in these sad times of war in\r\nwhich my undertakings have been begun, so many are found ready to give\r\nthe same ardour to scholarly pursuits that they are giving to fighting\r\nagainst the infidel and to civil strife. Thus it happens that even from\r\nthe midst of war arises literature, which has for so many years lain\r\nburied. And it is not only in Italy, but also in Germany, in France, in\r\nPannonia, in Spain, and in England, and wherever the Latin language\r\nis known, that young and old are devoting themselves to the study of\r\nGreek. The joy that this brings to me causes me to forget my fatigues,\r\nand redoubles my zeal to do what is in my power for the service of\r\nscholarship, and particularly for the students who are growing up in\r\nthis time of the renaissance of letters.”\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of the sixteenth century, the difficulties\r\nin the transmission either of merchandise or of money were many.\r\nThe packages of books which Aldus had occasion to send to Reuchlin\r\nin Stuttgart, for instance, came forward sometimes by way of\r\nMilan, Vienna, or Basel, and later through Augsburg. The Augsburg\r\nbanking-house of Függer, founded about 1450, possessed in 1500 (and\r\nfor half a century thereafter) connections which enabled them to take\r\ncharge not only of what we should call mercantile bills and banking\r\ncredits, but also of the forwarding and delivery of the goods against\r\nwhich the bills were drawn. They carried on what to-day would be called\r\nan express business, and in a majority of instances the instructions\r\nwere evidently to make collections on delivery. During the first half\r\nof the sixteenth century, the Függers, with their branch houses in\r\nFlorence, Venice, and Genoa, supplied the most valuable machinery\r\nfor the transaction of business between Italy and Germany. These\r\ncommunications, however, were of necessity very frequently interrupted\r\nby the troubles of the times.\r\n\r\nIn 1510, Mutianus Rufus writes to Urban that “in connection with the\r\nconflicts between the French and the Venetian soldiers, the passes\r\nof the Alps have been blocked, so that literature from Venice can no\r\nlonger find its way into Germany. I had hoped with the next Frankfort\r\nFair, to be able to place in the hands of my students the beautiful\r\nAldine editions. But my hopes were in vain. When the Fair was opened,\r\nthere was not a single volume from Italy. We shall be able this spring\r\nto do nothing in our classical schools. Oh, the stupidities of war!”\r\n\r\nIn 1514, the Elector Frederic the Wise of Saxony applied to the several\r\npowers interested for a safe conduct for his librarian, Spalatin, whom\r\nhe desired to send to Venice to purchase directly from Aldus the Aldine\r\nclassics for the library of Wittenberg. Some difficulties intervened,\r\nhowever, as Spalatin appears never to have reached Venice. It was\r\ndoubtless due to the long-continued wars between the Emperor and the\r\nStates of Italy, that Aldus was unable, during his own lifetime, to\r\nestablish direct agencies in Germany for his publications. We find\r\nrecord of such agencies in Frankfort, Basel, Augsburg, and Nuremberg,\r\nfirst in the time of his son, agencies which were extended by the\r\ngrandson.\r\n\r\nThe active work of Aldus extended over a period of twenty years,\r\nfrom 1495 to 1515. This time included the wars of 1500, 1506, 1510,\r\nand 1511, in which Venice was directly engaged, wars which had of\r\nnecessity much to do with the interference with his business, and with\r\nthe difficulties, of which he makes continual complaint, in securing\r\nreturns for his sales. “For seven years,” writes Aldus in 1510, “books\r\nhave had to contend against arms.” There appears to have been no\r\nsingle year of the twenty in which he was free from pressing financial\r\ncares, while from time to time the work of the presses and in the\r\ncomposing room came to an actual standstill for want of funds. During\r\nthese twenty years he printed not less than 126 works which previously\r\nexisted only in manuscript form, and the manuscript copies of which had\r\nto be secured and carefully edited.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Aldus, in his own enthusiasm concerning the value\r\nand importance of the re-discovered classics, had overestimated the\r\nextent of the interest that could be depended upon for these classics\r\nthroughout the world. It is evident, however, that there were enough\r\nscholars in Italy, Germany, France, and the Low Countries, to assure\r\na widespread demand for the Aldine editions, and that the larger part\r\nof the publisher’s difficulties consisted in the lack of convenient\r\nmachinery for making known to these scholars the fact that such books\r\nhad been prepared, for the delivery of such copies as might be ordered,\r\nand for the collection of the payments due.\r\n\r\nAnother serious difficulty with which Aldus had to contend was the\r\ncompetition of the piratical copies of his editions which promptly\r\nappeared in Cologne, Tübingen, Lyons, and even so close at home as\r\nFlorence. The most serious interference with his undertakings appears\r\nto have come from the printers of Lyons, who in their enterprising\r\nappropriations from Paris on the one hand and from Nuremberg, Basel,\r\nand Venice on the other, speedily won for their city notoriety as the\r\ncentre of piratical publishing. The Lyons printers printed editions of\r\nthe Aldine Latin classics, making a very close imitation of the cursive\r\nor italic type, and issued the volumes without imprint, date, or place\r\nof publication.\r\n\r\nThe privileges secured from the government of Venice had effect, of\r\ncourse, only in Venetian territory. Privileges were given by the Pope\r\nfor a number of the Aldine publications, and these covered, in form,\r\nat least, not only the States of the Church but the territory of\r\nall States recognising the papal authority, while the penalties for\r\ninfringing such papal privileges were not infrequently made to include\r\nexcommunication. There was, however, no machinery by means of which the\r\npapal authority could be brought to bear upon Catholics infringing or\r\ndisregarding the privileges, and as a fact the papal privileges proved\r\nof very little service in protecting the literary property either of\r\nAldus or of later literary workers. A further word concerning the\r\nprivileges issued in Venice and in the other States of Italy will be\r\ngiven in a later division of this narrative.\r\n\r\nApart from this important work in the scholarly and editorial divisions\r\nof publishing, Aldus made several distinctive contributions to the\r\nart of book-making. He was, as before stated, the first printer who\r\nfounded complete and perfect fonts of Greek type, fonts which for many\r\nyears served as models for the printers of Europe. He invented the type\r\nwhich was first called cursive, and which is known to-day as italic,\r\na type having the advantage of presenting the text in a very compact\r\nform. (The cursive font was said to have been modelled on the script\r\nof Petrarch.) And finally, he was the first publisher who ventured\r\nupon the experiment of replacing the costly and cumbersome folios\r\nand quartos, in which form alone all important works had heretofore\r\nbeen issued, with convenient crown octavo volumes, the moderate price\r\nof which brought them within the reach of scholars of all classes\r\nand helped to popularise the knowledge and the influence of classic\r\nliterature. This constituted a practical revolution in publishing\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nAldus had possibly read the remark of Callimachus, the librarian of the\r\nAlexandrian library in 290 B.C., that “A big book is a big nuisance.”\r\nThese Aldine classics, while printed in octavo (_i. e._, upon a sheet\r\nfolded in eights), were of a size corresponding more nearly to what\r\nwould to-day be known as a sixteenmo, the size of the sheet of paper\r\nbeing smaller than that used to-day. Aldus had no presses which would\r\nprint sheets large enough to fold in sixteen or even in twelve. The\r\nprice of these small octavos averaged three _marcelli_ or two francs,\r\nsay forty cents. Making allowance for the difference in the purchasing\r\npower of money between the year 1500 and the year 1895, I judge that\r\nthis may represent about $2.00 of our currency.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the Aldine editions served as the authoritative texts\r\nfor the authors presented, and even to-day they stand as a wonderful\r\nmonument of the imagination, the learning, the courage, and the\r\npersistency of their publisher. Good Italian though he were, Aldus\r\nwas by some of his countrymen charged with want of patriotism on the\r\nground that if he helped to make the study of the classics easy for\r\nthe Barbarians of the outer world, they would no longer need to come\r\nfor their learning to Italy, heretofore the centre and source of all\r\nscholarly enlightenment. To this effect writes Beatus Rhenanus in his\r\nintroduction to the Works of Erasmus:\r\n\r\n_Quidam Venetiis olim Aldo Manutio commentarios Græcos in Euripidem et\r\nSophoclem edere paranti dixit: Cave, cave hoc facias, ne barbari istis\r\nadjuti domi maneant et pauciores in Italiam ventilent._\r\n\r\nKapp is of opinion that the dread was well founded and that the\r\ndistribution throughout Germany and France of popular editions of the\r\nclassics, did have the result of keeping at home many students who\r\nwould otherwise have crossed the Alps. That they were now able to\r\nsecure, at moderate cost and in their own homes, learning for which\r\nheretofore they had been obliged to make long and costly journeys, was\r\ndue to the unselfish and public-spirited labours of Aldus. It was,\r\ntherefore, with good reason that he was held in high regard by the\r\nHumanists of Germany. They sought his friendship and nearly overwhelmed\r\nhim with correspondence. In 1498, Conrad Celtes and Vincenzo Longinus\r\ncommemorated his service in verse. Aldus thanked them for their\r\ncourtesy, and in sending them as an acknowledgment copies of his\r\n_Horace_ and _Virgil_, he asked them to bring him into communication\r\nwith any scholarly Germans who were interested in the classics. Aldus\r\ndid not, however, consider it wise to print the ode of eulogy that\r\nCeltes had written upon the Emperor Maximilian, because he was afraid\r\nof causing offence to the Bohemians and Hungarians through whose\r\nscholars he had secured not a few rare manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThroughout Germany the productions of the Aldine presses were received\r\nwith enthusiasm. Mutianus Rufus speaks of himself as weeping with joy\r\nwhen there came to him from a friend the precious gift of the editions\r\nof _Cicero_, _Lucretius_, and other classics. He and his friends Urban\r\nand Spalatin deprived themselves almost of the necessaries of life,\r\nin order to save moneys with which to bring across the Alps the other\r\nvolumes of the series. Pirckheimer and Reuchlin were among the first of\r\nthe German buyers of the Aldine classics. Hummelsburger writes in 1512\r\nto Anselm in Tübingen, “I shall buy my Hebrew books in Italy, where\r\nAldus has printed them in beautiful texts.... Germany no less than\r\nLatium owes a great debt to Aldus.”\r\n\r\nThe political status of Italy and its division into a number of states\r\nor principalities which carried on independent policies and which\r\nwere frequently in active warfare with each other, entailed serious\r\ndifficulties upon the new business of publishing, difficulties which,\r\nwhile troublesome enough for Aldus in Venice, were still more serious\r\nfor his competitors in Florence and Milan. A privilege secured for\r\nVenice was not binding even in times of peace outside of Venetian\r\nterritory, while in the frequently recurring times of war, any\r\nprivileges which a Venetian or a Milanese publisher had been fortunate\r\nenough to secure in the Italian States were abrogated in fact if not in\r\nform. In this respect, the early publishers of Paris, whose privileges\r\ncovered (nominally at least) the territory of the kingdom, had a\r\ndecided advantage over their rivals in the much divided territory of\r\nItaly or of Germany.\r\n\r\nAldus had the feeling, for which in his case there appears to have been\r\nsufficient ground, that his business undertakings, with which were\r\nconnected far-reaching plans for furthering scholarly knowledge, were\r\nabsolutely dependent upon his own continued and persistent personal\r\nattention. While he had succeeded in securing the services of scholarly\r\nassociates to share with himself the editorial responsibilities of his\r\nwork, he does not appear to have been able, with the material at his\r\ncommand, to train up any assistants competent to take any important\r\nshare in the business management. One of his many complaints concerning\r\nthe repeated interruptions which interfere with his important daily\r\nlabours, might have been uttered by many a publisher of later times. He\r\nwrites in 1514 (the year before his death) to his friend Navagerus:\r\n\r\n“I am hampered in my work by a thousand interruptions.... Nearly every\r\nhour comes a letter from some scholar, and if I undertook to reply to\r\nthem all, I should be obliged to devote day and night to scribbling.\r\nThen, through the day come calls from all kinds of visitors. Some\r\ndesire merely to give a word of greeting, others want to know what\r\nthere is new, while the greater number come to my office because\r\nthey happen to have nothing else to do. ‘Let us look in upon Aldus,’\r\nthey say to each other. Then they loaf in and sit and chatter to no\r\npurpose. Even these people with no business are not so bad as those\r\nwho have a poem to offer or something in prose (usually very prosy\r\nindeed) which they wish to see printed with the name of Aldus. These\r\ninterruptions are now becoming too serious for me, and I must take\r\nsteps to lessen them. Many letters I simply leave unanswered, while to\r\nothers I send very brief replies; and as I do this not from pride or\r\nfrom discourtesy, but simply in order to be able to go on with my task\r\nof printing good books, it must not be taken hardly.... As a warning\r\nto the heedless visitors who use up my office hours to no purpose, I\r\nhave now put up a big notice on the door of my office to the following\r\neffect: ‘Whoever thou art, thou art earnestly requested by Aldus, to\r\nstate thy business briefly and to take thy departure promptly. In this\r\nway thou mayst be of service even as was Hercules to the weary Atlas.\r\nFor this is a place of work for all who may enter.’”\r\n\r\nAldus Manutius died January 25, 1515, (Venetian style, corresponding to\r\nFebruary 6, 1515, modern style) aged sixty-five years. Until 1529, the\r\nbusiness was carried on for the heirs by his father-in-law, Torresano,\r\nand in that year was taken over by Paul Manutius, the son of Aldus.\r\nIn 1540, Paul took into partnership his son, Aldus the younger, and\r\nthe firm took the title of _Aldi Filii_. With the death of Aldus the\r\ngrandson, in 1597, the family, in its main line, became extinct, and\r\nthe work of the Aldine Press, which had continued for a little more\r\nthan a century, came to a close. To his children, Aldus was able to\r\nbequeath little besides his fame and the value of his name. The moneys\r\nthat had been earned during his work of twenty-five years from the\r\nsuccessful undertakings had been for the most part absorbed in other\r\nventures which were either unremunerative, or from which the returns\r\ncame but slowly. The carrying out of such great publishing plans\r\nrequired, in fact, business connections and methods which did not yet\r\nexist, and was dependent also upon the continuance of peace in Europe\r\nfor a quarter of a century, an impossible condition for the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon business ventures under such difficult circumstances,\r\nAldus was doubtless, from a business point of view, unwisely\r\noptimistic; but it is difficult not to admire the public spirit and the\r\npluck with which, in the face of all difficulties, he persisted till\r\nthe day of his death in the great schemes he had marked out for himself.\r\n\r\nWhile his work had brought no wealth, his life had been rich in the\r\naccomplishment of great things and in the appreciation given to his\r\nlabours. It was also his fortune to gather about him and to come into\r\nrelations with many noteworthy men, who as friends and co-workers\r\nshared his enthusiasm, and who gave with him unselfish labour for a\r\nscholarly ideal. Partly because the editors and the publishers were\r\nworking for results other than profits, partly because the books\r\npublished were (with a few noteworthy exceptions, like the writings of\r\nErasmus) not original works, but editions of old classics, and partly\r\nbecause the whole business of publishing was still in its infancy, the\r\nhistory of the Aldine Press does not present any important precedents\r\nas to the compensation earned by authors for their productions, or as\r\nto the protection of the author’s property rights in these productions.\r\nThe relations of Aldus with all the authors, editors, and scholars\r\nwith whom he had to do were however more than satisfactory; they were\r\ncordial, resting in a number of cases on a close personal friendship.\r\nThe scholars regarded the publisher as one of themselves, and, in fact,\r\naccepted him as a leader.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Erasmus, whose writings formed an important\r\nproperty, was satisfied with the returns secured for him by Aldus.\r\nHe speaks with cordial appreciation of the services rendered by his\r\n“authorised publishers,” Aldus of Venice, and Froben of Basel, and\r\nspeaks further of the losses caused to himself by the competition of\r\nthe piracy reprints of Lyons and Paris. It appears, therefore, that he\r\nretained a continued interest in the sale of his authorised editions,\r\nbut unfortunately no details of his publishing arrangements have been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe history of the publishing work of Aldus, while not presenting\r\nprecedents for royalty or copyright arrangements, constitutes\r\nnevertheless a very important chapter in the history of property in\r\nliterature. Aldus was able, by combining skilled editorial labour\r\nwith selected classics, to create a great literary property, which\r\nneeded only distributing machinery and a peaceable Europe to become\r\ncommercially valuable. He set the example also, for Italy at least,\r\nof securing privileges in each of the Italian States possessing any\r\nliterary centres, and although he was not always able to prevent\r\npiratical reprinting on the part of his competitors in Florence, or\r\neven always to keep out of other cities in Italy the piracy editions\r\nfrom Lyons, he accomplished something towards the ideal of a copyright\r\nthat should hold good for Italian territory. He even had hopes of\r\nsecuring, through the authority of the Pope, a system of copyright that\r\nshould prove effective in all Catholic States, and it was not until\r\nlong after Aldus’s death that the attempts to establish a Catholic\r\ncopyright system were given up by publishers as practically futile.\r\n\r\nHis latest biographer, Didot, himself both a fine scholar and a great\r\npublisher, contends that Aldus accomplished more than the greatest\r\nscholars of his time for the spread of learning and the development\r\nof literature; and the testimony of the three great scholars who were\r\ncontemporaries and near personal friends of the Venetian publisher,\r\nMusurus, Reuchlin, and Erasmus, fully bears out M. Didot’s opinion. It\r\nwas the exceptional combination of a creative imagination and scholarly\r\nknowledge with practical business ability and unfailing pluck and\r\npersistency, that enabled the young tutor to create the Aldine Press,\r\nthe work of which will cause to be held in continued honour, in the\r\nhistory alike of scholarship and of publishing, the memory of Aldus\r\nManutius.\r\n\r\n=The Successors of Aldus.=--Paul Manutius, the son of Aldus, continued\r\nfor some years the business of the Aldine Press, giving special\r\nattention to editions of the writings of Cicero. In 1561, he accepted\r\nan invitation from Pope Pius IV. to come to Rome and to take charge\r\nthere of the publication of the writings of the Fathers of the Church,\r\nand of such other works as might be selected. The amount required for\r\nthe organisation of an adequate printing-office was to be supplied\r\nfrom the papal treasury. Paul was to receive an annual stipend of 500\r\nducats, together with one half of the net profits realised from the\r\nsales of the works published, and the contract was to continue for\r\ntwelve years.\r\n\r\nAn interesting series of letters has been preserved, written by Paul\r\nto his brother Manutius in Asola, and to his son, Aldus the younger,\r\nin Venice. These letters, which are quoted by Renouard, Frommann, and\r\nDidot, contain a number of details and references which throw light\r\nnot only upon the personal relations of the writers, but upon the\r\nbusiness conditions of the time. We learn that Paul was a good deal of\r\nan invalid throughout his working years, and we gather the impression\r\nthat his feeble health was an important ground for the apparent lack of\r\nambition which made him willing to give up his work as an independent\r\npublisher in Venice and to accept the position of Pope’s printer in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nWe also learn that his son Aldus, while bright-witted, was lacking in\r\npersistency and in industry. The youngster never, in fact, accomplished\r\nanything of importance. Paul had himself inherited the scholarly tastes\r\nof his father, and had received a good classical education, but he does\r\nnot appear to have possessed very good business faculty, and he made no\r\ndistinctive mark as a publisher. The Pope had, however, asked for his\r\naid rather as a scholarly editor than as an experienced man of business.\r\n\r\nPius appears to have been impressed with the belief that the\r\nprinting-press, under scholarly management, could be made of service\r\nto the cause of the Church in withstanding the pernicious influence\r\nof the increasing mass of the publications of the German heretics.\r\nThese Protestant pamphlets and books were not merely undermining the\r\nauthority of the Church in Germany, Switzerland, and France, but were\r\neven making their way into Italy itself. The first issues of the Aldine\r\nPress in Rome were the _Decrees_ of the Council of Trent, in a variety\r\nof editions, the writings of Cyprian, and the letters of S. Jerome.\r\n\r\nPius V., who in 1565 succeeded Pius IV., was equally favourable to the\r\nundertakings of the printing-office, and gave to Paul the necessary\r\nsupport. The work was carried on in a building which was the property\r\nof the municipality, and some issues arose with the magistrates\r\nconcerning its continued use as a printing-office. From a letter dated\r\nSeptember 27, 1567, it appears that the magistrates had required that\r\nPaul should pay taxes or license-fees on his printing business, which\r\nthey classed as a trade. He took the ground that printing was not a\r\ntrade but an art, and that it was so defined in the invitation given\r\nto him to come to Rome, and in the agreement executed with him by the\r\nPope. He contended, further, that, as the Pope’s printer, whose work\r\nwas devoted to the Church, he was in any case entitled to exemption\r\nfrom the municipal taxes imposed on traders. The Pope does not\r\nappear to have fully backed up his printer in this contention, and a\r\ncompromise was finally arrived at under which a portion of the proceeds\r\nof the business was paid to the magistracy. The precise terms of the\r\narrangement are not clearly stated, but it seems probable that the\r\nhalf share of the profits previously payable to the papal treasury was\r\ndivided into two portions, one of which went to the municipality.\r\n\r\nThe profitable part of the business was in the printing of the official\r\neditions of the Catechisms and Breviaries. Paul complains, in fact,\r\nthat the presses are so occupied with the work of the Breviaries,\r\nthat he is not able to make progress with the printing of his own\r\n_Commentaries on the Letters of Cicero_. In June, 1568, Paul writes\r\nto his son Aldus, who was now of age, expressing his regret that the\r\nyoung man was not interested in devoting himself to carrying on the\r\nprinting-office in Venice. Aldus had, it seems, expressed a preference\r\nfor the study of law. The business in Venice was finally turned over\r\nto Basa, who paid, for a term of five years, twenty _scudi_ gold a\r\nmonth for the use of the existing material and for the good-will.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1569, difficulties began to accumulate about the\r\nprinting-office in Rome. The Pope was less interested and the\r\nmagistrates were troubling the office with what Paul calls\r\nunintelligent interference. There were, in fact, too many parties\r\ninterested in the management of the business to enable its control to\r\nbe easily or consistently exercised. Paul’s health was also failing\r\nseriously and he was longing for rest and for leisure to carry on his\r\nscholarly undertakings. In 1570, the ownership of the receipts of the\r\nprinting-office was somewhat simplified, the change being probably due,\r\nin part at least, to the representations of Paul that the many-headed\r\ncontrol was unworkable.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1570, Paul writes rather pathetically to Aldus: “In my case,\r\nscholarship and industry have never brought rest or fortune.... I pray\r\nGod that you may be better favoured.... I must beseech you, however, to\r\nput away childish things. It is full time that you recalled to yourself\r\nthe honourable traditions of our family.... My own active work must be\r\nnearly over.”\r\n\r\nIn June, of the same year, he again counsels Aldus, who had for some\r\ntime been betrothed, to make a speedy marriage, and then to concentrate\r\nhimself upon the work of the printing-office in Venice. He advises\r\nagainst a a plan that the young man had in view, of opening a retail\r\nbook-shop. He emphasises, however, that there is no chance of success\r\nfor a printer-publisher without the most persistent and arduous labour.\r\n\r\nIn 1571, Paul’s failing strength compelled him to leave Rome, resigning\r\n(as he hoped, for a time only) the income of the papal printing-office.\r\nHe devoted the winter months to the completion of his _Commentaries on\r\nthe Orations of Cicero_. The work was published in 1578-9 (after the\r\nauthor’s death) by his son Aldus in Venice, and, under arrangement, by\r\nPlantin in Antwerp. The negotiations with Plantin had been completed by\r\nPaul. He had specified the form and style of the Antwerp edition, and\r\nhad arranged to take his share of the profits in the shape of a royalty\r\non the sales.\r\n\r\nIn 1572, Paul being yet in Milan, one of his hopes was fulfilled in\r\nthe marriage of his son Aldus. “Now,” he wrote, “I can pass my days in\r\npeace. I feel hopeful for your future and rejoice that our line is to\r\nbe continued.” Later in the year, with no little difficulty (partly\r\non the ground of his feeble health, and partly because of the floods\r\nand wretched roads) he made his way to Venice for a brief visit. He\r\nwanted to see his son’s wife, and he desired also to give personal\r\ninstructions for the printing of his _Commentaries_. “I feel very\r\nhopeful,” he writes, “concerning the sale of my _Cicero_, and hopeful\r\nalso that it will not be reprinted (in piracy editions) during my\r\nlifetime.”\r\n\r\nPaul was obliged to leave Venice before the printing of his work was\r\nbegun, and the letter written after the receipt of the first sheets\r\nexpresses his bitter disappointment at the manner in which this\r\nall-important commission had been attended to. “If you had had in your\r\nhands some utterly contemptible scribble,” he writes, “you could hardly\r\nhave printed it in a more tasteless and slovenly style ... and you\r\nknew I had this undertaking so much at heart!... I have instructed\r\nBasa to burn all the sheets that have been printed, and to print these\r\nsignatures again, with a proper selection of type and on decent paper.”\r\n\r\nAldus the younger seems never to have had his heart fairly in his\r\nbusiness, and under his management (or lack of management), the\r\nprestige of the Aldine Press in Venice fell off sadly. He appears to\r\nhave been extravagant, or at least uncalculating, in his expenditures,\r\nand was also spending moneys which he could ill afford, not like his\r\ngrandfather for manuscripts and type, but for clothes and artistic\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\nPaul had accepted the pressing invitation of the new Pope, Gregory\r\nXII.; to resume his place as manager of the printing-office in Rome,\r\nbut with less exacting duties, and with a fixed salary. A plan was even\r\ntalked over between the Pope and Paul for the establishment of another\r\nprinting-office, which should be devoted entirely to the publication\r\nof classical works and of “expurgated” editions of works, portions of\r\nwhich had been condemned in the Index. Paul was to act as editor and\r\nsupervisor of the series, because his name was already recognised as\r\nthat of a scholarly authority. The scheme never, however, took shape.\r\nPaul’s strength failed rapidly, and he died in the spring of 1574.\r\n\r\nWhile he had devoted many years to his business as a printer-publisher,\r\nand had maintained the reputation of his name for a high standard as\r\nwell of typography as of scholarly writing, his own preference had been\r\nfor a scholarly rather than a business career. He went on with the work\r\nof his Press very largely because he felt that it was a duty he owed to\r\nhis father’s name and memory. His own memory is, however, chiefly to be\r\nhonoured for his scholarly edition of _Cicero_, with its comprehensive\r\nand analytical commentaries, an edition which long remained the\r\naccepted authority for Europe.\r\n\r\nA few years after the death of Paul, his son Aldus gave up the attempt\r\nto carry on the Press in Venice, a work for which he had never been\r\nreally fitted, and accepted a position in the University of Bologna, as\r\nprofessor of archæology. The printing business was sold, and the Aldine\r\nPress, after a century of work, came to an end.\r\n\r\n=Milan.=--During the fifteenth century, Italy presents a curiously\r\ncomplex and varied series of pictures and conditions. We find,\r\ntogether with constantly recurring civil strife, successive wars of\r\ninvasion from the North and from the East, and in the train of the\r\nfrequent armies, those inevitable camp followers, pestilence, famine,\r\nand misery. To the contests against the French and German invaders and\r\nthe strifes between states and cities, were added schism and discord\r\nin the Church itself, and there were long periods during which pope\r\nwas contending against anti-pope for the right to rule the world\r\nas the infallible head of an infallible church. Yet these years,\r\nwhen the land was troubled by schism and devastated by strife and\r\npestilence, were years during which the cities of Italy were becoming\r\nrich with an active and prosperous trade; while it was also at this\r\ntime that the art of Italy brought forth its greatest production and\r\nthat the development of its literature made most important advances.\r\nThe vitality of the people was so exuberant, its productive force so\r\nenormous, that notwithstanding the frightful waste caused by war and\r\npestilence, its energies were still sufficient for some of the greatest\r\nof artistic creations, for active and scholarly work in the new\r\nlearning and literature, and for a sharp competition for the leadership\r\nof the world’s commerce and industries. A typical example of the life\r\nand strife of the time is afforded by Milan, the capital of Lombardy.\r\nIts position as the northernmost of the great cities and in the centre\r\nof the open territory of the plains, exposed it to the first attacks\r\nof invaders from across the Alps, while the ambition of the rulers and\r\nof the people kept it in frequent strife with its Italian rivals. Its\r\ntrade seems to have continued active, however, (except when armies were\r\nactually at its gates) and while in art more important work was done\r\nin Florence, the first steps in the new literature, that is, in the\r\nliterature connected with printing, were taken in Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThe first printing in Milan was done in 1469 by Philip of Lavagna,\r\nwho was followed in 1470 by Antonio Zarotus. In the printing of books\r\nMilan holds precedence, therefore, over all the towns of Italy except\r\nSubiaco and Rome, antedating Venice by about a year. The publishing\r\nundertakings of the Lombardy capital never, however, rivalled in\r\nimportance those of Venice. In 1476, Paravisinus, printed an edition of\r\nthe Greek Grammar of Laskaris, the first volume printed in Europe in\r\nGreek characters. In the previous volumes containing Greek text, this\r\nhad been printed in Latin characters. The editor of the Grammar was\r\nDemetrius, a refugee from Crete. He was also the editor of the first\r\nedition in Greek of _Homer_. The first Missal was printed by Zarotus in\r\n1475.\r\n\r\nWhile in Rome the work of printing was begun by a German and in Venice\r\nby a Frenchman, the first printers in Milan were native Italians. Among\r\nthe earlier of the Lombard printer-publishers, we find the name of\r\nAlexander Minutianus, a learned professor, who devoted himself to the\r\nediting of a valuable series of Latin classics, and whose publishing\r\nactivities extended over a term of twenty years. Minutianus published\r\nin 1498-99, in four folio volumes, the first complete edition of\r\n_Cicero_. The relations of Milan with the cities north of the Alps\r\nwere more intimate at this time than those of any other Italian city,\r\nand it was natural, therefore, that as the printing business in\r\nLombardy increased in importance, German printers should begin to seek\r\nemployment there. The first whose name is recorded was Waldorfer (or\r\nValdarfer) from Regensburg, whose work began in 1474, and who brought\r\nwith him fonts of Gothic type. Waldorfer printed an edition of _Pliny’s\r\nLetters_ and a selection of the _Orations of Cicero_. These were\r\nfollowed by the _Commentary_ of Servius on _Virgil_, and by the first\r\nissue in print of the famous _Decameron_ of Boccaccio. The _Decameron_\r\nhad been written in 1353, and had, therefore, waited 120 years for a\r\npublisher. In 1493, Henricus Germanus and Sebastian Pontremulo printed\r\nthe first Greek edition of _Isocrates_. In Milan, however, work in law,\r\nscience, and medicine constituted a more important proportion of the\r\nearlier publications than in Venice or in Rome. The De Honate Brothers\r\nwere printing as early as 1472, works in jurisprudence, and Frommann is\r\nof opinion that before 1480 several firms were devoting their presses\r\nexclusively to the departments of law and science. In 1472, a company\r\nwas formed for the printing and publishing of books, probably the first\r\npublishing association in existence. There were at first five members\r\nor associates, as follows:\r\n\r\nAntonio Zarotus, a printer from Parma; Gabriel degli Orsoni, a priest;\r\nColla Montana, an instructor in the High School (he was concerned\r\nsome years later in the murder of the Duke Galeazzo Maria); Pavero\r\nde’ Fontana, a professor of Latin, afterwards editor of _Horace_; and\r\nPedro Antonio de’ Burgo, of Castiglione, a lawyer. Subsequently a sixth\r\nassociate was added, Nicolao, a physician and a brother of the last\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe Association was organised for a term of three years and its purpose\r\nwas stated to be the instituting of a printing-office, with not less\r\nthan four presses, and the carrying on of a book-manufacturing and\r\npublishing business. The capital was to be contributed in equal shares\r\nby four of the associates, the printer, Zarotus, investing no money,\r\nbut contributing his knowledge of the business and undertaking its\r\ngeneral management. The printer was to receive one third of the net\r\nproceeds, and the remaining two thirds were to be divided equally\r\namong his four associates. From the printer’s share were to be repaid\r\nthe first expenditures contributed by the other four. The subsequent\r\nexpenditures were to be met by the sales of the books. The person\r\nacting as corrector for the press, usually one of the scholarly\r\nassociates, secured as his compensation one or two copies of the work\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the books to be printed was to be made by the\r\nunanimous decision of the whole board, and the selling price was also\r\nto be fixed by the board. The organisation was to remain secret, and\r\nall employees were to take an oath of secrecy and obedience. Each\r\nmember bound himself to give no council or aid to any other publishing\r\nconcern and to print no work with another printer except under the\r\npermission of his associates. At the termination of the agreement, the\r\nprinter was to have a right to purchase at a valuation the presses and\r\nthe manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist of the concern was the lawyer Antonio de’ Burgo, and\r\nhe found the funds (100 ducats) with which the first operations were\r\ninitiated. Under a supplementary agreement, the lawyer Burgo and his\r\nbrother the physician assumed for their individual account one half of\r\nthe rent of the premises and purchased three additional presses. These\r\npresses were kept at work exclusively in the production of a series of\r\nworks in the departments of law and medicine. The printer Zarotus took\r\ncharge of the manufacture of these books for the brothers Burgo, in\r\naddition to those printed for the Association. The editorial work in\r\nselecting the material and in preparing them for the press was cared\r\nfor by the Burgos, who also appear to have attended to the publishing\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe brothers paid over to the treasury of the Association twenty-five\r\nducats for the use of the plant (type, etc.) outside of the presses,\r\nand were to pay also one fourth of the proceeds of the sales of their\r\nseries. Each associate was also to receive a copy of each book printed.\r\n\r\nThe brothers agreed to print no books excepting in the departments of\r\ncanon and civil law and of medicine, and the Association was to include\r\nin its list no works in these departments. The penalty for infringing\r\nthis provision was fixed at 200 ducats.\r\n\r\nThe brothers were not at liberty to dispose of their portion of the\r\nprinting-office to any other parties. At the end of three years, the\r\npresses and publications belonging to the two Burgos were transferred,\r\non an appraisal, to Zarotus.\r\n\r\nNo records have been preserved of the results of their undertakings,\r\nor of those of the Association as a whole. The fact, however, that as\r\nearly as 1472, only eight years after the introduction of printing into\r\nItaly, there should have been sufficient business, or even expectation\r\nof business, to warrant the organisation of such a publishing company,\r\nis certainly noteworthy, if only as evidence of the intellectual\r\nactivity and business enterprise of the Italy of the fifteenth century.\r\nIt is curious also that special provision should have been made for\r\nlegal and medical publications, as the literary interests of the period\r\nof the Renaissance, which had so much influence in furthering the\r\nactivities of the earlier Italian printers, were so largely classical.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for the first publishers to be both printers\r\nand scholars, and this necessary condition of early publishing\r\nundertakings, the association of adequate scholarship with technical\r\nknowledge required for the making of books, was fully provided for\r\nin the Milan company, which included, as we have seen, two classical\r\nprofessors, one theologian, one jurist, and one physician.\r\n\r\nMore than a century later, in 1589, was organised the Guild of the\r\nPrinters, Publishers, and Booksellers of Milan. During the hundred\r\nyears that had passed since the printing-press began its work in\r\nLombardy, the city had known various rulers, and had, for a brief term,\r\nenjoyed independence. By far the larger portion of the century had\r\nbeen for Lombardy periods of turmoil, and the years of uninterrupted\r\npeace had been few. It was, therefore, not surprising that the\r\nbusiness of the production of books had developed more rapidly and\r\nmore prosperously in Venice, Rome, and Bologna, which were from their\r\nposition better protected against the mischances of war.\r\n\r\nIn 1589, Lombardy was a portion of the great Spanish Empire, and (as it\r\ncontained few heretics) it was enjoying under the rule of Philip II.,\r\na period of peace and of comparative prosperity. The charter of the\r\nGuild or Corporation of the Printers and Publishers was confirmed by\r\nKing Philip himself. The Stationers’ Company of England had received\r\nits charter from Queen Mary in 1556, or thirty-three years earlier.\r\nThe Guild of the Venetian Printers dated from 1548, and was the\r\nearliest association of the kind in Europe. The affairs of the Guild\r\nof Milan were managed by a board of directors, comprising a Prior, a\r\nBursar, and two Councillors. The Board had charge of the property of\r\nthe corporation, and was responsible also for the protection of its\r\nprivileges under the charter, and for the defence of any of its members\r\nwhose rights might be assailed. It rested also with the Board to see\r\nthat the regulations of the Corporation were properly carried out, and\r\nin the event of any assessment being laid upon the organised Printers\r\nand Publishers, it was the duty of the Bursar to apportion the payments\r\nequitably among the members of the Guild.\r\n\r\nTo the Board was also given authority to adjudicate disputes not only\r\nbetween members of the Guild, but between the members and outsiders,\r\nand its jurisdiction extended over the entire duchy. From the decisions\r\nof the Board there was, as a rule, no appeal. In case, however, the\r\nissue involved any complicated questions of law, so that it became\r\nnecessary for the Board to call in the counsel of a jurist, an appeal\r\ncould be made from the decision arrived at to a special court of\r\narbitration, which was also, however, to be made up of members of the\r\nGuild. The roster of the Guild was in the special control of the Prior,\r\nand this record was of special importance, because no one whose name\r\nwas not on this roster as a member in good standing was permitted to\r\nprint or to sell books in Milan, under a penalty for each offence of\r\nfifty gold _scudi_.\r\n\r\nNo one was eligible for membership who had not served an apprenticeship\r\nof eight years to a printer or book-dealer in Milan. The fee for\r\nadmission was, for one born in Milan, thirty lire, for others one\r\nhundred lire.\r\n\r\nOne purpose of the organisation of the Guild was to prevent the\r\ncompetition of foreign printers and booksellers from breaking down\r\nthe trade of the Milanese. A more legitimate object was to keep the\r\nbusiness of printing, publishing, and selling books in the hands of\r\ntrained men of high character, good education, and technical training,\r\nwho should conduct their work in a manner worthy of the repute of\r\nMilan. It had been the complaint that many unworthy and unskilled men\r\nhad crowded into the business of making and selling books, lowering the\r\nstandard of the trade and diminishing the profits. It was complained\r\nalso that the paper-manufacturers or paper-dealers had undertaken\r\nto sell books, notwithstanding a specific statute prohibiting them\r\nfrom so doing. The royal commissioner, whose sanction was required\r\nto validate on behalf of the King the regulations of the new Guild,\r\nstipulated, however, in confirming the renewal of this prohibition,\r\nthat the paper-makers should still be permitted to sell certain special\r\nbooks which had for some years been in their hands, but that no other\r\npublications must be sold by any paper-dealer who had not secured\r\nmembership in the Guild as a properly qualified bookseller.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, after an interval of three centuries, to decide whether\r\nthis undertaking for the closer organisation of the book-trade was\r\nreally prompted, as was contended, by the desire to keep on the highest\r\npossible plane the business of making and selling books, or whether it\r\nwas the result of a selfish desire on the part of the older Milanese\r\ndealers to increase their profits and to keep out competitors. It is\r\nprobable there was a mixture of motives, but it is certain that in\r\nMilan, as in other book centres, the formation of the Guild gave an\r\nimportant incentive to printing and publishing, improved the quality\r\nof the work done, and tended to keep the business in the hands of a\r\ngood class of men, and it is evident also that such results must have\r\nbrought advantages also to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe more important of the regulations of the Guild can be summarised as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. No member of the Guild shall reprint or shall sell any book issued\r\nby another member, provided such book has not before been printed in\r\nMilan, and provided also that the edition claiming protection shall\r\nitself have been printed in Milan. A book printed outside of the duchy\r\ncannot secure the protection of a Milanese privilege. The penalty for\r\ninfringement is the forfeiture of the copies printed and the payment of\r\nten gold _scudi_.\r\n\r\n2. Each publication shall bear the imprint of its printer or publisher\r\n(usually, of course, the same person).\r\n\r\n3. Apprentices and assistants must be registered on the records of the\r\nGuild.\r\n\r\n4. The sale of books in any places other than the registered shops\r\nor places of business is forbidden; and the purchase of books from\r\napprentices or from any not known to be duly authorised dealers is also\r\nmade a misdemeanour.\r\n\r\n5. The sale of books on Sundays or holidays, either in the shops or in\r\nthe dwellings, is forbidden.\r\n\r\n6. No printer or dealer must use for his sign a token identical with or\r\nclosely similar to that already in use with an authorised printer or\r\ndealer.\r\n\r\nThese regulations appear to have had the desired effect of repressing\r\nif not of entirely exterminating the business of the unauthorised\r\nprinters and traders. In 1614, however probably for the purpose of\r\nimpressing a fresh generation of unauthorised traders, the Guild\r\nsecured a fresh royal edict, which again confirmed the authority of the\r\nGuild and enjoined, under heavy penalties, the strictest obedience to\r\nits regulations.\r\n\r\nFrommann points out that in the application for this new decree, the\r\nGuild no longer lays stress upon the necessity of upholding the dignity\r\nand honourable standard of the book-trade, but emphasises the risk\r\nto the Church and to the community of believers if uneducated and\r\nirresponsible persons, not familiar with the lists of forbidden works,\r\nshould be permitted to print or to sell books. Experience had evidently\r\nmade clear to the publishers that with a government like that of Spain\r\n(which might be described as despotism tempered by the Inquisition)\r\nthis class of considerations would be much more influential than any\r\nthought of upholding the dignity of the business of making and selling\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners make reference to the decree accompanying the latest\r\n_Index Expurgatorius_, which forbids any one from carrying on business\r\nas a printer, publisher, or bookseller, who has not taken oath before\r\nthe ecclesiastical superiors or the Inquisitor of his district to\r\nconduct his business in full loyalty to the holy Catholic Church, and\r\nto give explicit obedience to all the decrees and enactments of the\r\nChurch and of the Inquisitor for the regulation and supervision of the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners go on to state that this edict of the Church has\r\nlargely fallen into disregard because ordinary traders, _merzeranii_,\r\nuneducated and irresponsible men, not trained to the book-business and\r\nhaving no knowledge of or no respect for the _Index Expurgatorius_,\r\nhave been allowed to print and to sell books, to the detriment not only\r\nof the legitimate book-trade, but of the Church and of the community.\r\nThe King (Philip III.) appears to have agreed with the Guild that this\r\ninterference with an organised book-trade (which from the very fact\r\nof its organisation could be and was effectively supervised by the\r\nChurch) constituted a very dangerous abuse.\r\n\r\nThe new edict, with its severe penalties, and with the effective\r\nco-operation of the local inquisitors and other ecclesiastics, appears\r\nto have had the effect desired. We hear no more from the publishers\r\nof Milan about irresponsible competition, and the business prospered\r\nas far as was practicable within the rather narrow limits fixed by\r\nthe censorship of the Church. The most noteworthy productions of the\r\nMilanese presses between the years 1500 and 1700, were, as stated, in\r\nthe departments of jurisprudence and medicine. The greater activity\r\nof publishing in these two departments may very possibly have been in\r\npart due to the fact that they were less affected by the ecclesiastical\r\ncensorship.\r\n\r\n=Lucca and Foligno.=--The little city of Lucca is entitled to mention\r\nin connection with the introduction of printing into Italy, if only\r\nbecause it was the only city in Italy (and possibly the only one\r\nin Europe), in which the new art secured the direct support and\r\nco-operation of the government in the form, first of a municipal decree\r\nin favour of the printing-press, and secondly of a direct subvention\r\nfrom the municipal treasury in encouragement of the first printer. The\r\nprinter was Clemente, a native of Padua, who was engaged in business\r\nin Lucca as a scribe and illuminator. It was made a condition of the\r\nappropriation (the amount of which is not stated) that the printer,\r\nwho was to be classed as a public functionary, was to hold himself in\r\nreadiness to teach the art to all who might desire to learn. Clemente\r\nestablished his press in Lucca in 1477, and printed there in that year,\r\nan edition of the _Triumphs of Petrarch_. He had previously printed\r\nin Venice a work by John Mesne, of Damascus, on universal medicine, a\r\nlarge folio of 400 pages.\r\n\r\nA still smaller city than Lucca, Foligno in Umbria, enjoys the\r\ndistinction of having received as its first printer, Johann Numeister,\r\nwho had been a pupil and assistant of Gutenberg himself. After the\r\ndeath of his master, Numeister came to Italy with the intention of\r\nsetting up a press in Rome. He was induced to settle at Foligno at\r\nthe instance of Orfinis, a wealthy citizen, who supplied the funds\r\nnecessary for the undertaking. The first publication of the Foligno\r\nPress was _Leonardi Aretini Bruni de Bello Italico adversus Gothos_,\r\nwhich bears date 1470.\r\n\r\nThe imprint states that the book was “printed by Numeister in the house\r\nof Emilianus de Orfinis.” The second work selected was an edition of\r\nthe _Divina Commedia_ of Dante, the manuscript copy of which had been\r\ncollated and corrected for the press by Orfinis. Orfinis died in 1472,\r\njust before the printing of the _Commedia_ was completed. Numeister\r\npaid a tribute to his patron in the last line of the rhyming imprint:\r\n\r\n  _Nel milla quatro cente septe e due\r\n  Nel quarto mese; a di cinque et sei,\r\n  Questa opera gentile impresso fue,\r\n  Io maestro Johanni Numeister opera dei\r\n  Alla dicta impressione, et meco fue,\r\n  El Elfuginato, Evangelista mei._\r\n\r\n--Humphreys interprets the words “Evangelist mine” as standing for “the\r\none who made me known to the world.”[450] M. Bernard writes, “better\r\nEvangelist than I am.” The last volume bearing the name of Numeister\r\nwas an edition of Torquemada’s _Contemplations_. With his death in\r\n1479, the brief record of the press of Foligno comes to a close.\r\n\r\n=Florence.=--Florence, which for a century or more had been the\r\ncentre of the intellectual life of Italy, and which presented in\r\nits great collection of manuscripts, its central position, and its\r\nimportant trade connections, distinctive advantages for the work of\r\nbook-publishing, was comparatively late in giving attention to the new\r\nart, and the issues from the Florentine presses before the close of the\r\nfifteenth century, were much less important than those of Venice and of\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nThe first book printed in Florence, a commentary on Virgil, by Servius,\r\nbears date 1471. It was issued by Bernardo Cennino, and appears to have\r\nbeen his sole publication.\r\n\r\nCennino was by trade a goldsmith, and had been associated with Ghiberti\r\nin the work on the famous gates of the Baptistery.[451] An enthusiast\r\nabout the artistic pre-eminence of Florence and of Italy, he was said\r\nto have been jealous of the glory that had come to Germany through the\r\ninvention of printing, and he determined to master the art without\r\nGerman aid.[452] In the colophon to his work, he describes the labour\r\nof the creation of his press, a labour which included the engraving of\r\nthe steel punches and the casting of the type. His publishing venture\r\nwas costly and probably unprofitable, and he appears to have printed no\r\nsecond book. He continued, however, in connection with his trade as a\r\ngoldsmith, the work of engraving punches for type.\r\n\r\nThe German printers speedily found their way to Florence as they had\r\nalready done to Rome, Venice, and Milan. In 1472, a certain Peter,\r\ndescribing himself as “de Moguntia,” (of Mayence) printed an edition\r\nof the _Philocolo_ of Boccaccio, and in the same year, he issued the\r\n_Triumphs of Petrarch_.\r\n\r\nThe subscription reads: “Master Peter, son of John of Mayence, wrote\r\n(_scripsit_) this work in Florence, the 12th day of November, 1472.”\r\n\r\nHumphreys points out that this imprint is an example of the habit\r\nof the early printers of considering their art as a kind of magical\r\n_writing_ rather than as a mechanical contrivance.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the early printer-publishers of Florence was\r\nNicholas of Breslau. In 1477, he published Bettini’s _Monte Sancto di\r\nDio_, which, according to Humphreys, presents the first example of\r\nillustrations by means of engraved plates. In 1478, Nicholas published\r\nan edition of Dante, the most elaborate that had yet appeared. Dante\r\nhad evidently already taken possession of the intellectual interest\r\nof Italy, and as early as 1472, no less than three editions had\r\nappeared. The fact that the poetry of Dante was given to the public\r\nin Italian, secured for it a much wider range of popular appreciation\r\nthan was within reach of works written in Latin. The same was true\r\nof the works of Boccaccio and of Petrarch, which, with the aid of\r\nthe printing-press, promptly came into the hands of large circles of\r\nreaders. _Petrarch_ was first printed in 1470, and _Boccaccio_ in 1471,\r\nand thereafter editions of both authors followed rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn 1474, a press was set up in the monastery of San Jacopo di Ripili,\r\nnear Florence, by two monks of the Brotherhood of S. Dominic. The\r\ngreater part of the books printed by them were distributed among the\r\nmonasteries as gifts or in exchange, but as the reputation of their\r\npublications increased, they found it necessary to accept orders\r\nfrom booksellers and from the outside public. Later, they added a\r\ntype-foundry to their plant.\r\n\r\n=Genoa.=--The first printing-office in Genoa was established in\r\n1471 by a German from Olmutz, named Moravus, who associated with\r\nhimself, in 1474, an Italian named Michael da Monaco. The scribes, or\r\n_manuscriptists_, as they called themselves, made a vigorous protest\r\nagainst the new art. They addressed, in 1471, a petition to the\r\nmagistracy in which they prayed to be protected from the competition\r\nof these newly arrived printers, at least as far as the production\r\nof Breviaries, Donati, and Psalters was concerned, as upon the\r\nmultiplication of these they depended for their livelihood. Humphreys\r\nstates that the original of this petition is still in existence.[453]\r\nThe record of the reply given by the magistrates has not been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe printers were evidently not forbidden to print these books of\r\nservice, as editions were speedily produced. The influence of the\r\nscribes appears, however, in the end, to have been sufficient to\r\nestablish a kind of cabal against the printers, and in the course of\r\na year or two the German gave up the attempt and removed his press\r\nto Naples. There was doubtless in all the Italian cities a large\r\nmeasure of jealousy and opposition on the part of the old _librarii_,\r\n_stationarii_, and _scriptores_, but Genoa appears to have been the\r\nonly city where they were strong enough actually to drive out the\r\nprinters, at least for a time.\r\n\r\nThe first Hebrew Bible printed in Europe was issued in Soncino in 1488,\r\nfrom the press of Abraham Colonto. It is described as a very fine piece\r\nof typography and as note-worthy for the artistic chapter-headings and\r\nfor the elaborate decorations of the marginal borders of the pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Question of Copyright\r\n\r\nComprising the text of the Copyright Law of the United States, and\r\na summary of the Copyright laws at present in force in the chief\r\ncountries of the world; together with a report of the legislation now\r\npending in Great Britain, a sketch of the contest in the United States,\r\n1837-1891, in behalf of International Copyright, and certain papers\r\non the development of the conception of literary property and on the\r\nresults of the American law of 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILED BY GEO.

The\r\nauthor’s account of the literary development of Greece is evidence of\r\ncareful investigation and of scholarly judgment. Mr. Putnam writes\r\nin a way to instruct a scholar and to interest the general reader.\r\nHe has been exceptionally successful in describing the progress of\r\nletters, the peculiar environment of those who are interested in the\r\ncareer of the dramatist and the philosopher, and that habit of mind\r\ncharacteristic of Hellenic life.--_Philadelphia Press._\r\n\r\nA most valuable review of the important subject of the beginnings\r\nof literary prosperity. The book presents also a powerful plea\r\nfor the rights of authors. The beginnings of literary matters in\r\nChaldea, Egypt, India, Persia, China, and Japan are exhibited with\r\ndiscrimination and fairness and in a very entertaining way. The work is\r\na valuable contribution upon a subject of pressing interest to authors\r\nand their public.--_New York Observer._\r\n\r\nThe work shows broad cultivation, careful scholarly research, and\r\noriginal thought.

J. J. Jusserand in his “Literary History of the English\r\nPeople.” ... Only the most meagre sketch of the pleasure in store\r\nfor the readers of M. Jusserand’s volume can be given here. No one\r\ninterested in the beginnings of English literature can fail to be\r\npleased with this delightful study. A thoroughly stimulating book\r\n... which will arouse fresh interest in the early periods of our\r\nliterature.--_Literary World._\r\n\r\nM. Jusserand is an investigator of keen insight and indefatigable\r\nenergy. He has also the quality which gives to him, from his Latin\r\nparentage, synthesis and literary tact.... He paints a picture....\r\nIt is unquestionably true that for this generation, M. Jusserand has\r\nsaid the last word on this subject.... For the period of Chaucer, he\r\nhas summarized what is known with admirable skill.... His work must\r\nbe accepted as the authority on the Middle Ages as they were lived in\r\nEngland.--_N. Y. Commercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\nThe book bears witness on every page to having been written by one\r\nwhose mind was overflowing with information, and whose heart was in\r\nabounding sympathy with his work. Mr. Jusserand possesses pre-eminently\r\nthe modern spirit of inquiry, which has for its object the attainment\r\nof truth and a comprehension of the beginnings of things and of the\r\ncauses that have brought about effects.--_N. Y. Times._\r\n\r\nAfter so many excellent works, of which English literature is the\r\nsubject, have been issued in England and on the Continent, after\r\neven the epic work of Taine, yet M. Jusserand still contrives to be\r\noriginal, fresh, and creative. The history of English literature has\r\nbeen written before, but what he gives us is something new; it is the\r\nliterary history of the English people, that is to say, he makes us\r\nfollow the historical evolution of the nation in literature, and what\r\nthat evolution has created and revealed. He has employed a method\r\nwhich could not be used with success, except by a man with a thorough\r\nand correct knowledge of literature and the history of the English\r\npeople, and of the people themselves, and one who is worthy of serious\r\nconsideration by all literary historians.--_La Revue de Paris_, July 1,\r\n1894, on the French Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n  G.
