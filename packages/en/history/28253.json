They have no pretension to the title of detailed History,\r\nfor it has been possible to chronicle only the circumstances which\r\nshaped the University in its infancy and the important events of its\r\nsucceeding years. The story is one of struggle and disappointment, of\r\ndiscouragement and controversy, and of ultimate success and triumph. The\r\nmen who made McGill were men of far and clear vision, of unfaltering\r\ncourage and unwavering faith. They never doubted the final breaking of\r\nthe clouds; they were baffled only to fight better in their forward\r\nmarch on behalf of national enlightenment. They believed in the future\r\ngreatness of Canada, and of the place of education in moulding their\r\ncountry's destiny. The students of to-day who enjoy the advantages of a\r\ngreat seat of learning are not always conscious of the toil and the\r\nanxiety, the weariness and the fret of their College's early years; they\r\nperhaps do not always appreciate their glorious heritage and the efforts\r\nand the sacrifices of those who scorned delights and lived laborious\r\ndays in order to leave that heritage behind. The author's hope is that\r\nthe story of struggle herein recorded may deepen our gratitude for our\r\nprivileges, and our reverence for McGill and the men who made it.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible here to enter into minute details of\r\norganization or administration or personnel. The book is a story of\r\nepochs rather than of individuals,--but epochs in which the sign posts\r\never pointed onward. Biographical material has, therefore, been reduced\r\nto a minimum and no attempt has been made to give names or notices of\r\nProfessors, many of whom, the writer is well aware, should otherwise\r\nreceive appreciative reference as among the makers of McGill. With the\r\nexception of the portrait of the present Principal, too, the photographs\r\ninclude of necessity only those who are already numbered with the\r\nUniversity's past.\r\n\r\nThe writer's deepest thanks are here expressed to those without whose\r\nassistance this story could not have been told. He is grateful to\r\nProfessor Stephen Leacock for advice and encouragement; to the\r\nPrincipal, the Governors, and the Secretary of McGill, Mr. A. P. S.\r\nGlassco (Science, 1901), for permission to examine letters and minutes;\r\nto Dr. J. A. Nicholson, (Arts, 1887) for his valuable aid in locating\r\nand obtaining access to documents; to the staff of the Redpath Library,\r\nespecially Miss D. A. Lomer, for their unfailing and patient help in the\r\nsearch for records; to Mr. J. W. Jeakins, Secretary of the Graduates'\r\nSociety, and to Mr. E. Ardley of the Redpath Museum for kind assistance;\r\nto the attendants in Archives for many courtesies; to George B. Fraser,\r\nEsq., for permission to photograph prints; to the late Rev. Dr. Robert\r\nCampbell whose knowledge and memory of old Montreal was wide and vivid;\r\nand particularly to John Lane, Esq., of the Bodley Head for his personal\r\ninterest and experienced advice in the preparation of this volume.\r\n\r\nSince the information concerning the ancestry of James McGill is at\r\npresent meagre, I should be glad if any reader possessing information as\r\nto his ancestry and early career would communicate with me in Canada, or\r\nwith my publisher, Mr. John Lane, The Bodley Head, Ltd., Vigo Street,\r\nLondon, England, so that this section of the book may be amplified in\r\nfuture editions.\r\n\r\nC.

The century mark in the University's history has\r\nnow been passed. One hundred years is a long period in the life of a\r\nnation or a country; it is a longer period still in the life of an\r\nindividual; but it is perhaps longest relatively in the life of an\r\neducational institution, particularly if that institution had its birth\r\nin struggling pioneer days. It is a period in university life which\r\nsees, as a rule, an undreamed of growth and development from small\r\nbeginnings to unlimited influence, from scanty resources and great\r\ndisappointments to a large if not always adequate endowment and\r\nequipment, from a merely local service to a national and even a world\r\neducational power. This is distinctly true of the century of McGill\r\nUniversity's story. It began as a College, intended to minister to a\r\nvery small community. It has grown in one hundred years to serve the\r\nworld. It has graduated over twenty-five hundred Bachelors, over\r\nthirty-three hundred Doctors of Medicine, over nineteen hundred\r\nEngineers, over eight hundred Lawyers besides holders of higher or\r\ngraduate degrees; it has given hundreds of graduates to high positions\r\nin the Church, the State, and industrial and educational institutions.\r\nIt has drawn its students from all lands, and it has sent its products\r\nin trained men and women into every country on the globe. Long ago it\r\ndivested itself of the merely local, and to-day the old term, _Studium\r\nGenerale_, used in the middle ages to designate a University, may well\r\nbe applied to McGill,--\"a School where students of all kinds and from\r\nall parts are received.\"\r\n\r\nThe establishment of McGill University was but part of a more\r\ncomprehensive plan to improve educational conditions in Canada in the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century. After the peace treaty of 1763, which\r\nended the Seven Years' War and gave Canada to the British, immigration\r\nto the colony was comparatively small, and little effort was made by the\r\nHome Government to provide educational opportunities for the children of\r\nthose who sought happiness or fortune in the new land beyond the ocean.\r\nIndeed, in that time the authorities were too busy trying to solve\r\ndifficult problems at home to devote much energy to the internal\r\nproblems of the colony. They had no time and perhaps they had even less\r\ncare for their colonists. The treaty of 1763 had not brought peace. The\r\nadvocacy for political change was causing deep anxiety and the new\r\nradicalism under the plea for the new democracy was making a slow but\r\nsteady advance which troubled the statesmen of the age. Then came in\r\nquick succession the American Revolution, the French Revolution and the\r\nPeninsular War, all of which absorbed the attention of the Home\r\nGovernment. By her steadfast attitude in 1776, Canada had proved her\r\nright to expect and to receive sympathetic attention and encouragement\r\nfrom the Home Government, but it is perhaps not to be wondered at that\r\nin the circumstances of the troubled period the educational advancement\r\nof Lower Canada was neglected or ignored, and that educational\r\nopportunities were practically non-existent.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Canada education seems to have received more\r\nsympathetic interest. Particularly in the Maritime Provinces good\r\nschools had been established, largely, however, through the efforts of\r\nthe colonists themselves. A new impetus was given to education by the\r\narrival of many settlers from the United States during and after the\r\nRevolution. These settlers had enjoyed in New England excellent\r\neducational advantages; they had lived close to great universities with\r\ntheir beneficent influence, the Universities of Harvard and Yale, of\r\nWilliams and Dartmouth and Brown, and they determined to establish in\r\ntheir new home the educational facilities which they had already enjoyed\r\nin another land. It was felt in Lower Canada that similar opportunities\r\nshould be speedily provided for the English-speaking children of the\r\ncountry. The majority of settlers in Lower Canada were of Scottish\r\norigin. They were largely soldiers or the descendants of soldiers who\r\nhad fought in the Highland Regiments during the campaign of 1759, and\r\nwho after the Treaty of Paris in 1763 had taken up the land assigned to\r\nthem by the Crown. Many of these soldiers, too, later became fur-traders\r\nand entered the service of the North-West Company. These settlers were\r\nall eager that their children should have at least an elementary\r\neducation. It was felt, too, that in the unrest and the uncertainty of\r\nthe period immediately following the American Revolution it was not\r\nadvisable to send students in search of higher professional training to\r\nthe universities of the United States, which in the days of their\r\nBritish allegiance had attracted Canadian students in large numbers. But\r\nabove all, the settlers realised the necessity for the establishment of\r\nschools in which the children of the French-Canadians should be taught\r\nEnglish. It was declared that from the national point of view such\r\ntraining would have a far-reaching influence on the future of Canada as\r\nan integral part of the British Empire, and that without such\r\ninstruction, which would result in a bond of language, Canada could\r\nnever be a united land.\r\n\r\nEfforts were accordingly made to establish a system of free schools,\r\nwith the hope that later a university might be founded. As early as 1787\r\nthe matter received the serious consideration of the Legislative\r\nCouncil, and a scheme of education in the Province was actually\r\nprepared. But the scheme met with vigorous and determined opposition\r\nfrom one section of the community and it was in the end abandoned by the\r\nauthorities after a somewhat bitter controversy. Some years passed\r\nwithout further action. In 1797 General Simcoe, the first Governor of\r\nUpper Canada, and his Executive Council decided to establish a Seminary\r\nfor higher learning in that Province. They invited Mr. Strachan, a\r\ngraduate of St. Andrews' University, Scotland, to organise the College\r\nbut before he arrived in Canada General Simcoe was removed from office\r\nand the establishment of the proposed university was long delayed. The\r\nplans of Upper Canada in 1797 to establish a university, although their\r\nfulfilment was long postponed, inspired the people of Lower Canada to\r\ngreater efforts on behalf of education. They continued their agitation,\r\nbut their efforts had little immediate success. The conditions in Lower\r\nCanada were earnestly and anxiously set forth in the following appeal\r\nmade to the Governor-General, Sir R. S. Milnes, by the Rev. Dr. Jacob\r\nMountain, Lord Bishop of Quebec, on October 19th, 1799:\r\n\r\n\"There is so intimate and obvious a connection between the education of\r\nyouth and the general state of public morals, that I trust I shall not\r\nbe thought to deviate from the duties that are more particularly\r\nassigned to me, if I presume to solicit your Excellency's attention to\r\nthe disadvantages under which the Province has long laboured from the\r\nwant of proper schools for the instruction of the children both of the\r\nhigher and of the lower orders of the community.\r\n\r\n\"In doing this, it is by no means my intention to enter into the\r\nexamination of these disadvantages so far as they are common to us with\r\nevery other society which is without proper institutions for the\r\neducation of youth; I shall take the liberty of mentioning such only as\r\nappear to be in a great measure peculiar to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"Let me be permitted, then, to suggest the danger which may result to\r\nthe political principles and to the future character as subjects of such\r\nof our young men among the higher ranks as the exigency of the case\r\nobliges their parents to send for a classical education to the colleges\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n\"In these Seminaries, most assuredly, they are not likely to imbibe that\r\nattachment to our constitution in Church and State, that veneration for\r\nthe Government of their country, and that loyalty to their King, to\r\nwhich it is so peculiarly necessary in the present times to give all the\r\nadvantage of early predilection in order to fix them deeply both in the\r\nunderstanding and the heart.\r\n\r\n\"To obviate this danger, it would seem expedient to found at least one\r\ngood Grammar School in this Province and to invite able Masters from\r\nEngland by the liberality of the endowment.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be improper to state here that there is already at Quebec a\r\nrespectable school, which offers the means of instruction to those who\r\nare designed for the more accurate professions, or for the pursuits of\r\nTrade and Commerce in which, together with the lower branches of\r\neducation, are taught the Latin language, Mathematics, and Navigation,\r\nby a master well qualified for the task he has undertaken. I would wish\r\nto suggest the expediency of insuring the continuance of this advantage\r\n(which has not hitherto been duly appreciated) by some mark of the\r\nprotection of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"But it is not only good Grammar Schools for the education of such young\r\nmen as are designed for the learned Professions or who from their rank\r\nin society may hereafter fill situations of great political importance\r\nin the Province that are wanted; a more humble but a not less important\r\nbranch of the community seems to call also for your Excellency's\r\nbenevolent attention.\r\n\r\n\"It is well known that the lower orders of the people in this Province\r\nare for the most part deplorably ignorant; that the very slender\r\nportion of instruction which their children obtain is almost entirely\r\nconfined amongst those, who do not live in the Towns, to the girls\r\nalone; and more especially, it is notorious that they have hitherto made\r\nno progress towards the attainment of the language of the country under\r\nwhich government they have the happiness to live.\r\n\r\n\"This total ignorance of the English language on the part of the\r\nCanadians draws a distinct line of demarcation between them and His\r\nMajesty's British subjects in this Province, injurious to the welfare\r\nand happiness of both; and continues to divide into two separate peoples\r\nthose, who by their situation, their common interests and their equal\r\nparticipation of the same laws and the same form of Government, should\r\nnaturally form but one.\r\n\r\n\"If the evils are confessedly great which arise from this want of a\r\ncommunity of language, it should seem expedient to endeavour to provide\r\nan immediate remedy for the defect, and it should also seem that this\r\ncan only be done by facilitating as much as possible the means of\r\nacquiring the English language to the children of the Canadians.\r\n\r\n\"The plan which I would beg leave to submit for this purpose is simple\r\nand I trust practicable. Its aim may appear to be humble, but its\r\neffects, I am persuaded, would be in a high degree beneficial and\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\"It is briefly this:--that a certain number of English School Masters,\r\nto be hereafter determined, should be employed and paid by the\r\nGovernment; that one of these should be placed in each of the cities and\r\ntowns, and in the most considerable villages for the purposes and under\r\nthe express obligation of teaching the English language _gratis_ to a\r\ncertain number of the Canadian children, and writing and arithmetic when\r\nrequired, at an easy rate; that Trustees or Commissioners should be\r\nappointed to manage the fund which the Government in its bounty may see\r\nfit to appropriate to the end, to determine the number of Masters that\r\nmay be required, their respective salaries, and the number of children\r\nthey shall respectively teach _gratis_, to fix the rate at which Writing\r\nand Arithmetic shall be taught on, and to have the power of removing the\r\nMasters for incapacity or neglect of duty, and of promoting them\r\nsuccessively to the more lucrative situations for able and meritorious\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\"I would barely hint, by way of a leading idea upon this subject, that\r\nthe salaries might perhaps extend from £20 to £60 per annum according to\r\nthe number of inhabitants in the Village, Town, or City in which the\r\nTeacher should be placed, and that it might perhaps not improperly be a\r\ncondition that he who received a payment of £20, should be obliged to\r\nteach English _gratis_ to _ten_ Canadian children, he who received £30\r\nto fifteen children, and so on in proportion.\r\n\r\n\"The importance and extent of this subject demand, I am well aware, more\r\nlocal information and better judgment than I have been able to apply to\r\nit;--I presume only to suggest it as an object not unworthy of immediate\r\nconsideration to your Excellency's superior wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal was submitted by the Governor-General to the Executive\r\nCouncil of Lower Canada and was approved by that body. It was then\r\nforwarded to the Colonial Office for further consideration. As a\r\nresult, on July 12th, 1800, the Duke of Portland, sent to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor a long despatch from which the following extracts\r\nindicate that the Home Government sympathised with the Lord Bishop's\r\nsuggestion:--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to making a suitable provision for the education of youth\r\nin Lower Canada, and more particularly for laying a foundation for\r\nteaching the English tongue generally throughout the Province, I not\r\nonly fully coincide with the sentiments expressed by the Bishop of\r\nQuebec and concurred in by the Executive Council on this point, but I am\r\nof opinion that the proposed Free Schools for this purpose should be\r\nestablished under the express condition of teaching the English language\r\n_gratis_ to the children of His Majesty's subjects resident within the\r\ndistrict for which such schools are established, without any limitation\r\nas to the number of such children.\r\n\r\n\"The Master should certainly be authorised to make a reasonable demand\r\nfor teaching Writing and Arithmetic or, what would be still better, the\r\nterms may be settled from time to time by the Trustees or Governors of\r\nsuch Free Schools in the appointing of which it is His Majesty's\r\npleasure that the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or person\r\nadministrating the Government for the time being, the Bishop of Quebec,\r\nthe Chief Justice of the Province, and the Speaker of the Assembly\r\nshould always be of the number.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the Free Schools for teaching the English language,\r\n(which I consider to be of the first necessity, and for the\r\nestablishment of which you will consider yourself hereby authorised to\r\nappropriate from the Provincial revenues such sums as may be necessary\r\nto pay the salaries of the Masters who shall from time to time be\r\nappointed by you), it will be necessary in one or perhaps two instances\r\nto have recourse to others of the higher order and of the nature of our\r\nPublic Schools here, in order that neither the means nor the necessary\r\nencouragement may be wanting to cultivate the study of the learned\r\nlanguages. It appears to me that this establishment will be sufficient\r\nfor the present, although in due progress of time Foundations of a more\r\nenlarged and comprehensive nature will be requisite for the promotion of\r\nReligious and Moral Learning and the study of the Arts and Sciences.\r\nWith this view His Majesty, ever ready to manifest his paternal\r\nconsideration and regard for his subjects, and desirous to afford all\r\npossible assistance and encouragement to his Province in carrying into\r\nexecution an object of such importance as the instruction and education\r\nof youth, has signified to me his Royal pleasure that you should upon\r\nconsulting the members of His Majesty's Executive Council report to me\r\nin what manner and to what extent it would be proper to appropriate a\r\nportion of the Crown Land or revenues arising therefrom for this\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of the agitation for the providing of educational\r\nopportunities in Lower Canada, the Royal Institution for the Advancement\r\nof Learning was established by Act of the Legislature in 1801. Under\r\nthis Act, the King gave directions for the establishment \"of a competent\r\nnumber of Free Schools for the instruction of children in the first\r\nrudiments of useful learning; and also as occasion should require for\r\nfoundations of a more comprehensive nature.\" It was declared that \"His\r\nMajesty had further signified his intention that a suitable portion of\r\nthe Lands of the Crown should be set apart, and the revenue thereof\r\nappropriated to these purposes.\" The Act provided that all property\r\nwhich should thereafter be given, bequeathed or purchased for\r\neducational purposes was to be vested in the trustees of the Royal\r\nInstitution, with the necessary powers of management. Provision was made\r\nfor the establishment of Free Schools at specified places throughout the\r\nProvince by the authority of the Government, and for the building and\r\nrepairing of schoolhouses, but not for the salaries of the masters.\r\nAccordingly, elementary free schools were soon erected in different\r\nparts of the Province, and several teachers were appointed by the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the passing of the above Act, educational advancement in\r\nthe Province for many years made but slow progress. There was no\r\nadequate system of management. In 1803, Lord Hobart issued instructions\r\nto the effect that a portion of the Crown Lands was to be set apart for\r\nthe promotion of education. These instructions were not carried out; at\r\nbest such a scheme would have been insufficient for the purpose;\r\nsubsequent experience in the case of the Clergy Reserves proved the\r\ninefficacy of such an appropriation. There was a long delay in\r\nestablishing the Corporation which the Act of 1801 had in view. In 1815,\r\nthe Home Government directed the Provincial Government to proceed with\r\nthe election of trustees under the Act, but it was not until 1818 that\r\ntrustees were finally appointed. The trustees included the Lord Bishop\r\nof Quebec as Principal; the Lord Bishop of Montreal; the Chief Justice\r\nof Lower Canada; the Speaker of the Legislative Council; and the Speaker\r\nof the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enter here into the details of the early history of\r\nthe Royal Institution. Its first years were years of struggle. The\r\nschools erected under its authority were one-room buildings of cedar\r\nlogs. Indeed, they were mere log-huts, but they provided the first free\r\nEnglish Education in Lower Canada, and laid the foundation for a\r\nCanadian nationality. The records of the Royal Institution indicate the\r\ndetermination with which teachers and officials battled sturdily with\r\npoverty, and with discouraging conditions. The Secretary's salary was\r\nalways many months in arrears, and he frequently complained, with\r\nunfortunately but little satisfaction, that not only had he given his\r\ntime for some years without remuneration, but that he had expended even\r\nhis own fuel and candles. In 1819, thirty-seven schools were in\r\nexistence in the Province; these were occupied by fifty-three Teachers;\r\nthe total expenditure for education was £883.10; the highest salary paid\r\nwas £100,--at Quebec and at Montreal; the lowest salary was £11.5; the\r\naverage salary was £18. It was pointed out by the authorities that these\r\nsalaries were not intended to be the sole support of the teachers, but\r\nthat they were meant \"to operate as an aid and encouragement for the\r\nexertions and contributions of the inhabitants themselves.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the salaries were small and the school-buildings and equipment\r\nvery poor and uncomfortable, the discipline of the Royal Institution\r\nseems to have been surprisingly strict and exacting. Criticism of\r\nteachers, their methods and the books they used, was plentiful and\r\ncontinuous. It was not unusual for teachers to be censured \"for not\r\nkeeping school at all,\" or for giving too many holidays, or for\r\ntardiness in opening school in the morning and eagerness in closing it\r\nin the afternoon. At least one teacher was warned that his arrears in\r\nsalary would not be paid, and that he would be instantly dismissed \"if\r\nhe did not treat his wife with greater kindness.\" The teachers were\r\nbilletted among the inhabitants in their respective districts; after a\r\nfew days' sojourn in one house they moved on to another, thus making all\r\nthe settlers bear in turn the burden of providing their food and\r\nlodging. In this way they managed to exist on their scanty salaries,\r\nwhich were frequently unpaid for many months. The school-buildings were\r\nused at times by travelling missionaries for religious services. This\r\nseems to have been a source of much annoyance to the authorities; the\r\nteachers rather than the inhabitants of the district were always held\r\nresponsible, and were frequently severely reprimanded for permitting\r\nsuch use of the schoolhouses. It was not unusual for teachers to be told\r\nplainly by letter from the Secretary that they would be dismissed or\r\n\"that no part of the salary hitherto granted by the Government would be\r\nallowed, unless the Methodists were wholly and immediately excluded from\r\nusing the school-room as a place of worship.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution had many difficulties to contend with. Although\r\nits methods were not always efficient and its management was not always\r\nadequate, it is deserving of gratitude for laying the foundation of\r\nEnglish education in what was to be later the Province of Quebec. It not\r\nonly guided for many years elementary and grammar school education, but\r\nit planned for the establishment of a State or Government College where\r\nhigher education could be obtained. But before the proposed plan was\r\ncarried into effect, provision was made by a citizen of Montreal for the\r\nendowment of a College to bear his name. As a result, the Royal\r\nInstitution for the Advancement of Learning supervised the establishment\r\nof McGill College and directed it in its infancy, for under the Act of\r\n1801 all property and money given for educational purposes in the\r\nProvince of Lower Canada was placed under its control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF MCGILL\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion in the Legislature of educational conditions in\r\nLower Canada which resulted in the establishment of the Royal\r\nInstitution for the Advancement of Learning under the Act of 1801, one\r\nof the most prominent members of the Provincial Parliament was James\r\nMcGill, a merchant and fur-trader who represented the West Ward of\r\nMontreal in the Legislative Assembly. Only meagre facts about the life\r\nof James McGill are available and the documentary evidence bearing on\r\nhis career is scanty. He was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on the 6th of\r\nOctober, 1744. His parents were natives of Banffshire. After an\r\nelementary school education in his native town he entered Glasgow\r\nUniversity at the age of twelve, in accordance with the custom of those\r\ndays which permitted attendance at a University at a very early age. The\r\nMatriculation Album of Glasgow University contains the following entry:\r\n\r\n1756, Jacobus McGill, filius natu maximus Jacobi mercatoris Glasguensis.\r\n\r\nNine years later, his younger brother Andrew entered the University, as\r\nindicated by the following record in the Matriculation Album:\r\n\r\n1765, Andreas McGill, filius natu quintus Jacobi mercatoris\r\nGlasguensis.\r\n\r\nLike so many other adventurous Scotchmen of that period, after\r\ncompleting his education James McGill determined to seek his fortune in\r\nthe new land beyond the horizon, from which wondrous stories of the\r\nwealth and romance of the fur-trade were drifting to the old world. He\r\nemigrated to the American Colonies, where he remained for some years,\r\nand where he was later joined by his younger brother, Andrew. But before\r\nthe American Revolution the brothers moved to Canada and in 1775 they\r\nwere firmly and prosperously established in business in Montreal, where\r\nthe older brother became connected with the famous fur-trading\r\nNorth-West Company. That he was at that time regarded as one of the\r\nleading citizens is evident from the fact that he was selected for many\r\nimportant and responsible civic duties. During the American Revolution\r\nwhen Canada was invaded and General Guy Carleton withdrew all the troops\r\nto Quebec and left Montreal to its fate, James McGill was one of those\r\nwho saw the folly and uselessness of resistance. He preferred to save\r\nthe city from unnecessary destruction and he was one of the twelve\r\ncitizens,--six French and six English,--who were selected to sign the\r\ncapitulation of the city to General Richard Montgomery on November 12th,\r\n1775. His five associates were John Porteous, Richard Huntley, John\r\nBlake, Edward Gray and James Finlay. On December 2nd, 1776, he married\r\nMrs. Marie Charlotte Guillemin, a French Roman Catholic lady, the widow\r\nof a French Canadian gentleman, Joseph A. T. Desrivières. The ceremony\r\nwas performed by the Rev. David Charbrand Delisle, Rector of the\r\nProtestant Parish of Montreal and Chaplain of the Garrison. The Church\r\nrecord reads:--\"1776, James McGill, Esq., and Mrs. Charlotte Guillemin,\r\nwidow, were married by Licence the 2nd December, 1776.\" Mrs. James\r\nMcGill was born in Montreal in 1747, the daughter of William Guillemin\r\nand Claire Genevieve Foucault. She married Joseph A. T. Desrivières in\r\nMontreal on the 19th of September, 1763, at the age of sixteen.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival in Montreal James McGill acquired the Burnside\r\nestate of forty-six acres, with the Burnside Manor, in which he resided\r\nduring the remainder of his life. He took into partnership, under the\r\nname of \"McGill and Todd,\" his friend, Isaac Todd, a man of keen\r\nbusiness ability and of civic prominence.\r\n\r\nJames McGill is described by his contemporaries as of \"a frank and\r\nsocial temperament,\" in figure \"tall and commanding, handsome in youth\r\nand becoming somewhat corpulent in his old age,\" and in his leisure time\r\n\"much given to reading.\" He was a prominent member of the Beaver Club,\r\nthe members of which were all fur-traders who had amassed considerable\r\nwealth in their calling. A contemporary had a memory of him in jovial\r\nmood at one of the festal meetings of this Club, \"singing a voyageur's\r\nfolk-song with sonorous voice, and imitating, paddle in hand, in time\r\nwith the music, the action of the bowman of a canoe ascending a rapid.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of his pleasing personality, his prosperity and business\r\nstrength, and his marriage connections with another race and religion,\r\nhe was held in respect and popularity by all classes, irrespective of\r\nnationality or creed. It was therefore but natural that he should enter\r\npolitical life after the granting of the Constitutional Act by the Home\r\nGovernment in 1791. He was selected, with J. B. Durocher as his\r\ncolleague, to represent the West Ward of Montreal in the first\r\nparliament of Lower Canada which met on the 17th of December, 1792.\r\nLater he became a member of the Legislative Council, and in 1812 he was\r\nappointed one of the commissioners for removing from the city the old\r\nwalls which had been built in 1724. He took a prominent part in the\r\nMilitia organisation; during the war of 1812 he was honorary Colonel of\r\nthe Montreal Infantry Volunteer Regiment; later and before hostilities\r\nended, although he was too old for active service, he was promoted to be\r\nBrigadier General, and he seems to have had a large part in directing\r\nthe administration of the various Militia units. After a busy, active\r\nand strenuous life of unselfish service for his community and of devoted\r\nefforts for the promotion of tolerance and harmony between races and\r\ncreeds as the one sure foundation for a united Canadian nationality, he\r\ndied in Montreal on December 19th, 1813, at the age of sixty-nine, and\r\nwas buried on December 21st. The official record of his death reads: \"On\r\nthe nineteenth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirteen,\r\nthe Honourable James McGill, Colonel, Commandant of the Montreal\r\nMilitia, died, and was buried on the twenty-first following.\" The\r\ncertificate of death was signed by his partner, Isaac Todd, and by\r\nThomas Blackwood, a native of Lanarkshire, Scotland, who was at one time\r\nemployed in the firm of McGill and Todd, and who later formed a business\r\npartnership with Francis Desrivières.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas Pattendel--P. Canot Sculpsit\r\n_Montreal as James McGill knew it_]\r\n\r\nMrs. James McGill survived her husband less than five years. She died in\r\nMontreal on the 16th of April, 1818, aged seventy years and nine months,\r\nand was buried on the 18th following. There were no children from the\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nJames McGill was born of Scotch Presbyterian parents and he grew up in\r\nthe church and religion of his fathers. When he settled in Montreal\r\nthere was no Church of Scotland in the city. The first Presbyterian\r\ncongregation in Montreal consisted of a small group of Scottish\r\nsettlers. It was organised without a church building in 1786 by the Rev.\r\nJohn Bethune, who ministered to its members from March 12th in that year\r\nuntil he moved to Upper Canada in May, 1787. But it was but a temporary\r\norganisation and had no continuous status. From 1787 to 1790 there is no\r\nrecord of the holding of a strictly Presbyterian service in the city.\r\nThe only Protestant body holding service regularly was known as \"the\r\nProtestant Congregation of Montreal,\" the pastor of which was the Rev.\r\nDavid Charbrand Delisle, one of the three clergymen who had been\r\nemployed by the Church of England to labour among the French-Canadians.\r\nHe was Rector of the Parish of Montreal and Chaplain of the Garrison.\r\nThis congregation worshipped until 1789 in the Church of the Recollet\r\nFathers, which with great tolerance and courtesy was for twenty years at\r\ntheir disposal; in 1789 they were given the Chapel belonging to the\r\nJesuits' College, then Government property; they opened it for public\r\nworship in December under the name of Christ Church.\r\n\r\nLike all the young Protestant Scotchmen living in Montreal at that time,\r\nJames McGill became by necessity a member of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nCongregation. The adherents to the two Protestant creeds were tolerant\r\nand harmonious in their relations one with the other and they were\r\ncontent to worship together. In 1789 when the Bishop of Nova Scotia\r\nvisited Montreal an address was presented to him by the Church Wardens,\r\nand by \"a committee of the Protestant inhabitants of Montreal,\"\r\nirrespective of their former creed. The majority of the latter were\r\nScotch Presbyterians. The Bishop was met at Pointe aux Trembles by the\r\nreception committee. One of the \"Protestant inhabitants\" who signed and\r\npresented the address was James McGill. There is no doubt that the\r\nlarger number of this \"committee of Protestant inhabitants,\" at that\r\ntime identified with the Protestant Episcopal Congregation of Montreal,\r\nreturned to the Church of their fathers as soon as a Church was built,\r\nseveral of them becoming office-bearers. The precise action taken by\r\nJames McGill is uncertain. He seems to have divided his allegiance\r\nbetween the two communions; while not severing his connection entirely\r\nwith the Church of England he gave his support to the establishment of a\r\nChurch of Scotland and later became identified with it. When the St.\r\nGabriel Street Church, the first Presbyterian Church in Montreal, was\r\nbuilt in 1792, he subscribed ten guineas towards the construction of the\r\nbuilding. He signed the call to the first pastor of the Church, the Rev.\r\nJames Somerville; he thereafter contributed three pounds a year to his\r\nstipend and occupied pew No. 16 in the Church. His brother Andrew later\r\ncontributed five pounds towards removing the remaining debt from the\r\nbuilding. The Rev. Mr. Somerville, the pastor of the Church, officiated\r\nat Andrew's funeral. There is little doubt from the records that James\r\nMcGill regarded himself as of the Church of Scotland although he was for\r\na time, in those days of somewhat surprising religious harmony and\r\ntolerance, a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Montreal.\r\n\r\nOne of James McGill's most intimate friends and confidants in Canada was\r\nthe Rev. John Strachan, afterwards the Right Reverend Bishop of Toronto,\r\nwho was thirty-four years his junior. He was a native of Aberdeen,\r\nScotland. He received his M. A. from King's College, Aberdeen, in 1797,\r\nand then attended for some months Divinity Classes at St. Andrew's\r\nUniversity, near which he had a post as a Parish schoolmaster. Towards\r\nthe end of 1797, he came to Canada by invitation to organise a seminary\r\nof learning in Upper Canada, but the plan was abandoned and he became\r\ntutor in a private family in Kingston, Ontario. He offered himself as a\r\ncandidate for the pastorship of the St. Gabriel Street Presbyterian\r\nChurch on September 21, 1802, but before his letter was received another\r\napplicant, the Rev. James Somerville, had been accepted. Later he took\r\norders in the Anglican Church and was appointed to the Church at\r\nCornwall. He opened there a school and his fame as a teacher was soon\r\nwidespread. Among his pupils were the three sons of the Rev. John\r\nBethune who had established the first Presbyterian Congregation in\r\nMontreal, one of whom afterwards became Rector of Christ Church and\r\nacting-Principal of McGill University. In 1807, he married the widow of\r\nJames McGill's younger brother, Andrew, formerly Miss Wood of Cornwall,\r\nand he was thus brought into closer relationship with the McGill\r\nfamily. His enthusiasm for education and for its advancement in Canada\r\nwas unbounded and it is evident that he impressed his ideas as to ways\r\nand means and methods on the mind of his wealthy merchant friend. James\r\nMcGill was a believer in the value of education; he knew what it had\r\ndone for his own home-land, and what Scotland, educationally, was doing\r\nfor the world. He determined that the torch which for him had been\r\nlighted in Glasgow University should burn likewise for those who would\r\nsucceed him in the land of his adoption. He had indicated that\r\ndetermination during the consideration of the subject in the\r\nLegislature. But on the question of method he sought advice from his\r\nyoung teacher friend, Strachan, whom he frequently visited in the\r\nlatter's home in Cornwall. During these Glengarry visits there was many\r\na happy and roseate night of mingled sociability and high seriousness,\r\nafter the custom of their race and time, when the two friends, the young\r\neducationalist and the older man of wealth, with similar vision, sat\r\nlate in discussion of the Canadian educational problem and of plans for\r\nits solution.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the other surviving executors of James McGill's will,\r\nwritten from York [Toronto] on May 31, 1820, seven years after James\r\nMcGill's death, the Rev. Dr. Strachan gave interesting information on\r\nthese discussions and their bearing on the circumstances leading up to\r\nthe practical working out of James McGill's dreams on education as\r\nevidenced later in his will. He wrote: \"It was, I believe, at Cornwall\r\nduring one of the visits which Mr. McGill made to Mrs. Strachan and me\r\nthat his final resolution respecting the erection of a College after\r\nhis name, endowing it, etc., was taken. We had been speaking of several\r\npersons who had died in Lower Canada and had left no memorial of\r\nthemselves to benefit the country in which they had realised great\r\nfortunes. And particularly I mentioned a University, as the English had\r\nno Seminary where an Academical Education could be obtained. We had\r\nrepeated conversations upon the subject, and he departed determined to\r\ndo something and with some inclination to leave twenty instead of ten\r\nthousand pounds, together with Burnside, and even to make some\r\npreparations before his death, expressing at the same time a wish that\r\nif he did anything I should take an active part in the proposed\r\nCollege.\"\r\n\r\nIt was soon after the visit referred to that James McGill made his\r\nwill,--on March 8, 1811. He bequeathed to the Royal Institution for the\r\nAdvancement of Learning, in trust, the sum of £10,000 and his Burnside\r\nEstate of forty-six acres, together with the dwelling house and other\r\nbuildings, for the erection on the estate, and the endowment, of a\r\nUniversity or College on the express conditions,--and these were the\r\nonly conditions imposed,--that the University be erected and established\r\nwithin ten years of his death and that one of the Colleges to be\r\ncomprised in the University should be called \"McGill College.\" If the\r\nCollege was not erected in the time specified the conveyance to the\r\nRoyal Institution was to be null and void; and the estate and endowment\r\nwere to revert to his widow, and after her death to her first husband's\r\nnephew, Francis Desrivières and to his legal heirs. He named as\r\nexecutors of the will John Richardson, James Reid, John Strachan, and\r\nJames Dunlop.\r\n\r\nThese executors were all close personal friends of the testator. The\r\ncareer of John Strachan has already been outlined. Although it was not\r\nspecified in the will that he should be connected with the proposed\r\nCollege, it may be assumed that because of his close friendship, his\r\nmarriage connection, and his established reputation as a brilliant and\r\nsuccessful educationalist with definite ideas on Canadian nationality,\r\nJames McGill desired that he should have a prominent part in the\r\norganization of the College and that possibly he should be its first\r\nPrincipal. That this desire was stated to the trustees seems certain. In\r\na letter written from Toronto some years after James McGill's death,\r\nwhile the trustees who knew the circumstances were still living, Bishop\r\nStrachan said:\r\n\r\n\"If it had been my desire, it was certainly in my power to have been at\r\nthe head of it [McGill College] for it so happened that I had some\r\ndifficulty in prevailing with my friend, Mr. McGill, to forbear annexing\r\nit as a condition to his bequest that I should fill that situation;\" and\r\nhe added that \"a Professorship in McGill College was never desired or\r\nthought of by me, nor could any situation in that institution have\r\nformed an inducement to me to leave this Province to which I have been\r\nfor so many years devoted.\"\r\n\r\nThe three trustees associated with the Rev. Dr. Strachan as\r\nadministrators of the will were all prominent in civic and provincial\r\naffairs. They were all Scotchmen and were connected with St. Gabriel\r\nStreet Presbyterian Church. John Richardson, partner in the mercantile\r\nhouse of Forsyth, Richardson and Co., was a native of Banffshire,\r\nScotland. He represented the East Ward of Montreal in the first\r\nParliament of Lower Canada, which met in 1792, and he took his seat at\r\nthe same time as James McGill, his colleague from the West Ward. With\r\nthe latter, he was one of the commissioners appointed for the removing\r\nof the old city walls in 1802 and it was through his influence that the\r\nbill providing for the construction of a canal to Lachine was passed.\r\nThe firm of which he was a member contributed £20 towards the building\r\nof St. Gabriel Street Presbyterian Church and he personally subscribed\r\n£3 a year towards the minister's stipend; he occupied pews No. 6 and No.\r\n47. He was one of a committee of three formed to purchase the land on\r\nwhich the General Hospital now stands; he was chairman of the committee\r\nwhich superintended the construction of the Hospital and was later\r\nchosen as its first president. He died in 1831, aged seventy-six.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable James Reid, the second trustee named, was admitted to the\r\nBar of the Province in 1794; he was raised to the Bench as a puisne\r\nJudge in 1807, and later in 1823 he was made Chief Justice of Montreal.\r\nHe subscribed one guinea a year to the stipend of the first pastor of\r\nSt. Gabriel Street Presbyterian Church and occupied pew No. 14. He died\r\nin 1848 at the age of seventy-nine. After his death, his widow erected\r\nto the memory of her husband the southwest wing of the Montreal General\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nJames Dunlop, the fourth trustee named, settled in Montreal in 1777 and\r\nestablished a general store in St. Paul Street. He took an active part\r\nin the military organisation during the War of 1812, and served as Major\r\nunder Brigadier General James McGill. He subscribed ten guineas towards\r\nthe building of St. Gabriel Street Presbyterian Church and his name\r\nappears for ten pounds on a special subscription list for liquidating\r\nthe debt on the original building; he signed the manifesto in favour of\r\nthe first pastor of the Church, the Rev. James Somerville; he\r\ncontributed five pounds annually towards his salary and occupied pews\r\nNo. 19 and No. 99. He died in 1815 at the age of sixty.\r\n\r\nJames McGill's estate sloped from the base of Mount Royal towards the\r\nSt. Lawrence River. It consisted of forty-six acres of fertile land\r\nextending south to what is now Dorchester Street and reaching from the\r\npresent University Street on the east to what are now McTavish and\r\nMetcalfe Streets on the west. St. Catherine Street and Dorchester Street\r\nwere not then in existence and Sherbrooke Street was but a narrow road\r\nrunning through the farm. East, west and south of the estate were open\r\nfields and a few scattered houses, and the city proper lay a long\r\ndistance away, beside the water-front. A small stream of water passed\r\nthrough the farm. It entered from the east near the present Milton\r\nStreet entrance on University Street; it then turned south and was\r\nincreased in volume by the water from a spring near the site of the\r\nMacdonald Engineering Building. It passed on through the present tennis\r\ncourts in \"the hollow\" by the Physics Building, crossed Sherbrooke\r\nStreet where it was joined by another small stream from the southwest,\r\nand then flowed close to Burnside House and on towards the city. It is\r\nrecorded that the name Burnside was given to the estate because of this\r\nstream or \"burn\" as the Scotch called it. James McGill's home, Burnside\r\nHouse, a large stone building, was situated on the present McGill\r\nCollege Avenue, about midway between the present Sherbrooke and Burnside\r\nStreets on the left-hand side looking south; it was demolished in 1860\r\nto make room for the buildings now in that locality. A narrow road led\r\nfrom near the front of the house to what is now St. Antoine Street. The\r\nestate was divided into small sections which were later rented for\r\npurposes of cultivation or pasture. It contained numerous trees and\r\nshrubs, and was at that time regarded as one of the most valuable and\r\ndesirable parts of the district of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn the days of James McGill, Montreal was a small town of from twelve to\r\nfifteen thousand inhabitants, and of these the large majority were\r\nFrench. Indeed, the whole province had but a scanty population.\r\nOne-third of the houses were wooden huts. The town stretched out along\r\nthe water-front in a series of narrow blocks and straggling streets. The\r\ntrade with foreign countries was exceedingly small. The entire carrying\r\ncapacity of ships annually arriving at Quebec did not exceed 12,000\r\ntons, and only a few of these ships went on to Montreal. In 1813, the\r\nyear of James McGill's death, only nine vessels entered Montreal from\r\nthe sea, and their total capacity was but 1,589 tons. At the end of the\r\n18th century, the exports of furs and other products from the entire\r\nprovince was little more than half a million pounds sterling. Strange\r\nand primitive customs were still in vogue in the city. The price of\r\nbread was regulated by \"His Majesty's Justices of the Peace,\" and bakers\r\nwere required to mark their bread with the initials of their name.\r\nSlavery was not unknown, and a sale advertisement towards the end of the\r\ncentury included in the articles to be sold \"a stout, healthy negro man\r\nabout 28 years of age,--an excellent cook, and very fit for working on a\r\nfarm.\" A mail for England was dispatched about once a month. It went by\r\nway of New York and took from three to four weeks to reach that city; it\r\nwas then forwarded by packet-ship to England, and usually at least four\r\nmonths passed before an answer could be received. The incoming mail was\r\nput off the New York packet at Halifax; it came overland from Halifax to\r\nMontreal, this part of the journey alone taking nearly four weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo Rice Studios\r\nThe Burnside Estate]\r\n\r\nSuch was the somewhat primitive city in which James McGill lived and\r\nlaboured and amassed his wealth. Such was the community to the service\r\nof which he contributed unstintingly of his material substance, his\r\nenergy and his talent. Such, too, were the conditions in which this\r\nhard-headed, practical business man dreamed a dream,--a dream of a\r\ngreater Canada with a distinctly Canadian nationality trained to solve\r\nits own problems in its own way, and of the necessity for providing for\r\nthe youth of the great land mirrored in his mind the privileges of an\r\nadequate education similar to that which he had enjoyed in his own\r\nnative country. For James McGill seems to have been a combination of the\r\npractical Scottish business man and the dreaming Scottish mystic. Like\r\nthe other early Canadian pioneers of his race he was a hard-fisted man\r\nbattling by necessity in a hard-fisted new world, but he kept in that\r\nnew world the spiritual vision born of Scottish glens and mists and\r\nhills. He worked like his ancestors for the building of churches and\r\nschools and court houses, symbolic of religion, education and law, as\r\nmilestones of civilisation in a new land and without which no country\r\ncould make progress. He knew that without the torch of a free and\r\nliberal education the land of promise to which he had come and from\r\nwhich he had received much, could not advance to what he believed to be\r\nits destined place of power and service in the world. And so he dreamed\r\nof a great University which would not only be local in its usefulness,\r\nserving a small city which his faith told him would one day grow to\r\ngiant size, but also national in its influence, and ministering to the\r\nenlightenment of that larger Canada which his vision saw in the far and\r\ndim distance. The making of his bequest two years before his death for\r\nthe establishment and the endowment of McGill College was the first step\r\ntowards the fulfilment of his hopes. But between the dream and its\r\nultimate realisation lay long and troubled years of baffling difficulty\r\nand bitter discouragement, and at times, despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDELAY AND DIFFICULTY\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than three years after he had made his bequest, James McGill died,\r\nin December, 1813. Soon after his death the executors of his will sought\r\nto fulfil his desire with reference to the establishment of a College,\r\nand to ensure that the conditions imposed with regard to time would be\r\ncomplied with as speedily as possible. But they were confronted by\r\nobstacles over which they had no control. The will bequeathed the\r\nBurnside Estate and the Endowment Fund to the executors in trust, on the\r\nunderstanding that they should as soon as convenient after the\r\ntestator's death convey it to the Royal Institution for the Advancement\r\nof Learning, to be used by them as provided under the Act of 1801. But,\r\nas we have seen, the organization of the Royal Institution was bitterly\r\nopposed by one section of the community. Every effort to have trustees\r\nappointed and to have the Institution put in actual operation was\r\nfrustrated. The authorities feared to cause friction or discord, and\r\nthey preferred postponement. There was therefore no Royal Institution,\r\nother than in name only, to which the McGill bequest could be conveyed.\r\nThere were no trustees. It was necessary first for the executors and\r\nthose interested in the establishment of the College to effect the\r\nactual organization of the Royal Institution by securing the\r\nappointment of trustees as called for by the Act. They continued, with\r\nvigour, to impress this necessity upon the authorities in order that the\r\nMcGill bequest should not lapse, and they were promised prompt action.\r\nBut in that troubled period of warfare the Home Government was involved\r\nin too many difficulties to devote time to the problem. Action was for\r\nthese various reasons consequently long delayed and it was not until\r\n1818 that the promise was fulfilled and that the authorities at last\r\nappointed Trustees and established in fact the Royal Institution. Were\r\nit not for the fear of losing the legacy,--a misfortune which after all\r\nwas narrowly averted,--and the persistent efforts of the executors, the\r\nappointment would have been doubtless longer delayed. The Provincial\r\nLegislature could not appoint trustees without orders and they were\r\nunwilling to make any grant of money without authority from the Colonial\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nBut as a result of the hopeful promise made to the executors by the\r\nauthorities towards the close of 1814, the former began to discuss and\r\nto put forward plans for the carrying out of the desire of the founder\r\nof the College. The Rev. Dr. Strachan was their spokesman. On February\r\n14, 1815, he wrote to three personal friends who were then members of\r\nthe Legislature of Lower Canada asking their co-operation and\r\nassistance, advising haste, and setting forth his own ideas on the\r\nestablishment of McGill College,--ideas based on his knowledge of\r\neducational conditions in Canada and on his own experience of nearly\r\ntwenty years in educational work. He urged the Provincial Legislature to\r\nact independently of the Home Government and to grant the funds\r\nnecessary to put the College at once in operation, and he suggested\r\nmaking use of the Jesuits' Estates or the Crown Lands for this purpose.\r\nFrom this letter the following extracts are of interest:\r\n\r\n\"As we [the Executors] have sent the necessary documents to the\r\nCommander of the Forces to point out the necessity of his acting\r\npromptly in establishing a College according to the conditions of Mr.\r\nMcGill's Will, and as it is probable he may apply to the House of\r\nAssembly upon the subject, I furnish you with my ideas.\r\n\r\n\"The scheme enclosed for the two Schools and College is as economical as\r\nit can well be to render it respectable and useful. The number of\r\nstudents will not be great for some years, nor will it ever be such as\r\nto make the Professorships lucrative. Even the Principal will hardly\r\never be able to reach one thousand pounds per annum, a remuneration\r\nsufficiently moderate for the accumulated duties which he will have to\r\nperform and to maintain in such an expensive place as Montreal the\r\ndignity of his station. If the Provincial Parliament waits for something\r\nto be done by the King all will be lost,--for the Government have too\r\nmany things to call their attention. But when the matter is once set on\r\nfoot, an address from the Legislature can at any time procure assistance\r\nfrom His Majesty's Ministry. Yet six thousand pounds per annum appears\r\nto me a trifle, considering the increased opulence of the country. It is\r\nnot probable that the Roman Catholics will object to such an\r\narrangement,--they have already three Seminaries said to be well\r\nendowed,--but if any of them be poor the Legislature ought to grant them\r\npecuniary relief.\r\n\r\n\"I say nothing respecting religion, but in the Chapel of the University\r\nLectures on Theology may be given to Protestant students, which Roman\r\nCatholics shall not be required to attend. There are many particular\r\nregulations which I do not mention, I just furnish a crude outline.\r\n\r\n\"You are to recollect that if nothing be done, you will soon lose Mr.\r\nMcGill's donation. The time will never again be so propitious. I say\r\nnothing about the nomination of Professors; men of some talent must be\r\nselected and of great zeal for the promotion of the Sciences. The first\r\nPrincipal will have many difficulties to encounter and may not live to\r\nsee the Seminary in a very flourishing condition, but it will ultimately\r\nexceed the most sanguine expectations.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the form of the Scotch and German Universities to the English,\r\nor rather a mixture of both plans, because much more may be done at\r\none-fourth of the expense. In the English Universities the public\r\nProfessors seldom lecture more than once a week,--many of them not at\r\nall; the whole system of teaching is conducted by Tutors and emulation\r\nand a love of study is kept up among the students by fellowships, etc.\r\nThe great opulence of Cambridge and Oxford is far beyond our reach, and\r\nalthough I should be sorry ever to see them lose a shilling, for I think\r\nthem wisely adapted to so rich and populous and learned a country as\r\nEngland, I consider them unfit for this country. Our professors must\r\neach during the session, give two, three, or even four courses of\r\nlectures, till the funds afford the means of increasing their number.\r\n\r\n\"I must further add on the subject of finding Professors, that gentlemen\r\nnewly from England, and accustomed to the wealthy Universities of that\r\ncountry, may not always possess the qualities necessary to make them\r\nuseful in this projected Seminary. Learning they may have in abundance,\r\nbut the industry, labour (I may say drudgery) and accommodation to\r\ncircumstances cannot be expected from them. There are several gentlemen\r\nin this country qualified for the first race of Professors, and after\r\nthe Seminary is once set agoing there will be no risk in electing\r\nEnglishmen to fill vacant chairs, because the rules and regulations\r\nbeing established, all must submit.\r\n\r\n\"I have only mentioned one restriction, the Principal to be of the\r\nChurch of England. This, I think necessary on many accounts. The\r\nSeminary must and ought to have a distinct religious character, and this\r\nsimple regulation will confer it without circumscribing its liberality\r\nand openness to all persuasions. I think also the Principal's department\r\nshould be Moral Philosophy or Theology.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same letter Bishop Strachan outlined his suggested scheme for the\r\norganisation of McGill College. He pointed out \"that the necessity of\r\nsending young men out of the Province to finish their education has been\r\nfound both dangerous and inconvenient; that reason and policy equally\r\ndemand that our youth be educated in the Province, or in England, if we\r\nwish them to become friendly to our different establishments and to the\r\nParent State; that few can defray the expense of sending their children\r\nto England, and, if they could, the distance from parental authority is\r\ndangerous to their morals; and that there is at present no Seminary in\r\nwhich the English youth of Canada can obtain a liberal education.\"\r\n\r\nTo remedy these alleged evils, he therefore proposed that there should\r\nbe established \"two Grammar Schools, one at Quebec, and one at Montreal,\r\neach under a Rector or Head Master and three Assistants, at which the\r\nfollowing branches of education shall be taught: the Greek, Latin,\r\nFrench and English languages, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, and\r\nPractical Mathematics. These schools, to be appendages and nurseries for\r\na University to be established on the model of the Scotch and German\r\nUniversities in the neighbourhood of Montreal, on the property\r\nbequeathed for that purpose by the late Honourable James McGill, and to\r\nbe named as he desired, McGill College or University; that the following\r\nbranches of academical education be taught in the said University, (1)\r\nGreek and Latin; (2) Natural History and Botany; (3) Mathematics and\r\nAstronomy; (4) Natural Philosophy and Chemistry; (5) Moral Philosophy,\r\nLogic and Rhetoric; (6) Surgery and Anatomy; (7) Civil and Public Law;\r\nthat the Professors of Surgery and of Civil and Public Law shall not be\r\nrequired to reside within the College; that a house be provided within\r\nthe College for a Principal and four Professors; that the members of the\r\nUniversity be constituted a Corporation capable of sueing and being\r\nsued, and of receiving donations of money and lands, etc., for the\r\nbenefits of the Institution; that the Principal be always a clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England; that young men of all denominations, as\r\nChristians, be freely admitted to the different lectures; that new\r\nProfessorships be established as soon as the funds will admit; that the\r\nUniversity be represented in the House of Assembly by two Members; that\r\nno degree be conferred upon a student who has not resided three years;\r\nthat an attendance of three years at the University shall entitle a\r\nstudent to be called to the Bar one year earlier than any other,\r\nprovided he be of age; that a report of the state of the University be\r\nannually laid before Parliament; that there be frequent Visitations by\r\nthe Bishop, the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the House of Assembly,\r\netc., appointed a committee for that purpose; and that there be two\r\npublic examinations every year.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Strachan estimated the expense of the necessary buildings to be\r\n£18,000, \"made up of £4,000 for each of the two Grammar Schools\r\nincluding residence for the Head Masters, and £10,000 in addition to\r\nJames McGill's bequest of £10,000, an excellent site and house extremely\r\ncommodious for the Principal or one of the Professors.\" The annual\r\nexpense of the Grammar Schools was estimated at £2,000, \"made up of £300\r\na year to each of the Head Masters, £200 a year to each of two second\r\nHead Masters, £100 a year to each of four Under Masters, and £300 to\r\neach school for servants, repairs, library, premiums, etc.\" It was added\r\nthat \"this will render them desirable, and together with a moderate fee,\r\npayable by each scholar to his respective Teacher, will make them an\r\nobject to men of talent!\"\r\n\r\nThe total annual expense of the University was estimated at £4,000, made\r\nup as follows: \"The Principal to be also a Professor, £750; the Senior\r\nProfessor, £500; three Professors, £400 each; the Professor of Surgery\r\nand Anatomy, and the Professor of Civil and Public Law, £200 each; in\r\naddition each Professor is to enjoy a moderate fee from the students\r\nattending his lectures; for the purchase of books for the Library,\r\n£300; for the purchase of Philosophical and Chemical apparatus, £250;\r\nfor the purchase of Plants for the Botanic Garden, £100; Librarian's\r\nsalary, £100; Gardener's salary, £100; Servants and Contingencies,\r\n£300.\" It was explained that smaller salaries were given to the\r\nProfessors of Surgery and Law because \"they will be Professional men not\r\nexpected to reside in the College or to be exclusively confined to its\r\nduties, but attending at the same time to their private practice.\"\r\n\r\nThree reasons were given by Dr. Strachan for preferring Montreal to\r\nQuebec as the place for the establishment of the University: \"its more\r\ncentral position; its greater suitability for a Botanic Garden; and the\r\nlarge sum of money and a most beautiful estate already given for the\r\nexpress purpose.\" In conclusion, Dr. Strachan wrote: \"Thus it appears\r\nthat for an appropriation of £18,000, and six thousand pounds per annum,\r\nan establishment may be formed of incalculable importance to the\r\nProvince, in a religious, moral and political light. The Legislature\r\nmight in a few years be relieved from the burden by procuring from the\r\nCrown the Jesuits' Estates to be given for the support of the\r\nInstitution, and by grants of lands capable of becoming productive. The\r\nallowance for Philosophical and Chemical apparatus will in a few years\r\nbecome too great; the surplus may then assist the library.\"\r\n\r\nThe three members of the Legislature to whom this letter was sent by Dr.\r\nStrachan at once brought it to the attention of their colleagues, and\r\nthe question was again referred to the Home Government. It seems to have\r\nbeen pressed with earnestness and persistence but it was apparently not\r\nregarded as very urgent by the Colonial Office. The authorities were\r\nevidently too busy with the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and America, and\r\nwith their own internal problems to give much attention to Colonial\r\neducation, and the year passed without further action. Finally, on the\r\n30th of December, 1815, Lord Bathurst wrote from Downing Street to Sir\r\nGordon Drummond, then administering the Government of Lower Canada, the\r\nfollowing letter asking for information about the Jesuits' Estates, and\r\nintimating the intention of the Government to proceed with the\r\nestablishment of a College or Colleges in the Province, for the erecting\r\nof which the revenues of these estates might be used:\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, being desirous of marking by\r\nsome permanent establishment the high sense which he entertains of the\r\nexertions made by the Provinces of Canada during the late war with the\r\nUnited States, has been pleased to signify his intention of founding and\r\nendowing in the Province one or more Colleges for the education of\r\nyouth. An establishment so necessary cannot be too early accomplished,\r\nand although the details of such a measure are not completely arranged,\r\nyet Montreal has been from its central situation selected as the town\r\nbest fitted for such a purpose. There does not appear any reason why the\r\ncommencement of the work should not take place immediately. You will,\r\ntherefore, lose no time in selecting such a spot in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Montreal, taking care that the ground selected be\r\nsufficiently extensive to leave an adequate space for the formation of\r\nwalks and gardens, and you will proceed without delay to enclose it for\r\nthat purpose. You will further take the necessary measures for\r\nacquainting the trustees in whose hands the late Mr. McGill deposited by\r\nwill a sum of £10,000 in aid of this object, that it is the intention of\r\nHis Majesty's Government to commence such an undertaking and to call\r\nupon them as soon as the plan shall have been definitely settled for the\r\napplication of the funds entrusted to them for the purpose of erecting\r\nthe building. I forbear in this first stage of the undertaking to\r\nmention either the assistance which His Majesty's Government is prepared\r\nor may be enabled to give or that which the Province may be disposed to\r\ncontribute. The benefits of such an establishment are such as must be\r\nfelt both in the Colonies and in the Mother Country, and when felt\r\ncannot but ensure on the part of both a hearty co-operation and liberal\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\"With a view to the endowment of a College, the estates lately belonging\r\nto the Jesuits and now in possession of the Crown, afford a resource of\r\nwhich His Majesty's Government are to a certain extent determined to\r\navail themselves. But previous to deciding upon the extent of the\r\nestablishment it is necessary that I should be informed of the present\r\nvalue of these Estates, of their capability of improvement and of the\r\nmode in which their revenues have hitherto been disposed of.\r\n\r\n\"I have therefore to desire that you will as early as possible furnish\r\nme with adequate information upon these several points. Upon the receipt\r\nof which His Majesty's Government will lose no time in entering upon the\r\nfinal arrangement of an establishment calculated to afford to all\r\nclasses of His Majesty's subjects in the Province that degree of\r\neducation and those means of improvement which they have hitherto been\r\ncompelled to seek at a distance from home.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above letter that the writer had no knowledge of\r\nthe conditions of James McGill's will nor was he aware that before\r\nColleges could be established it was first necessary to appoint Trustees\r\nfor the Royal Institution and thereby to enable that body to assume\r\ncontrol of educational institutions established in the Province, as\r\nalready provided for by the Act of 1801. However, the Executors of the\r\nMcGill will were informed, as requested, of the Home Government's\r\nintention, and the information asked for with reference to the Jesuits'\r\nEstates was forwarded to the Colonial Office. Lord Bathurst was\r\napparently meanwhile made acquainted with the conditions of the will and\r\nwith the Act of 1801. A few weeks later, on March 14th, 1816, he again\r\nwrote to Sir Gordon Drummond, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My despatch of the 30th December will have informed you of the\r\ndetermination of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent to avail himself\r\nof the return of peace to forward the important objects of education and\r\ninstruction in His Majesty's Dominions, and especially in the Provinces\r\nof Canada. When I then addressed you I had not had an opportunity of\r\nperusing the will of Mr. McGill which afforded by the liberality of his\r\nbequest such important assistance in carrying such an object into\r\neffect. I have since been furnished with a copy of the will of which an\r\nextract is enclosed for your consideration. You will no doubt observe\r\nthat the mode in which the bequest is directed to be made, no less than\r\nthe nature of it, superseded the necessity of carrying into effect the\r\ninstructions conveyed to you on the 30th December under an erroneous\r\nimpression of its contents. You will therefore consider that instruction\r\nto be recalled and in lieu of adopting any measures for enclosing a spot\r\nwell fitted for the erection of the University, you will suspend all\r\nmeasures of such a nature till the necessary preliminary arrangements\r\nhave been made in conformity with the Act of Parliament of the Province\r\nof Lower Canada passed in the 41st year of His Present Majesty, entitled\r\n'An Act for the Establishment of Free Schools and the Advancement of\r\nLearning in this Province.' Those arrangements you will immediately\r\ncarry into effect, by appointing under the Great Seal of the Province\r\nthe following persons to be Trustees of the Schools of Royal Foundation\r\nin the Province in the manner and for the purposes specified in the Act\r\nand constituting them a Body Corporate by the name of the Royal\r\nInstitution for the Advancement of Learning. The persons to be nominated\r\nin the first instance are the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or person\r\nadministering the Government for the time being; the Right Reverend\r\nJacob Mountain, Bishop of Quebec; Jonathan Sewell, Esq., the Chief\r\nJustice of the district of Quebec; James Monk, Esq., the Chief Justice\r\nof the district of Montreal; the Reverend J. O. DuPlessis,\r\nSuperintendent of the Romish Church.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as this preliminary arrangement shall have taken place you will\r\ncall upon the persons named in Mr. McGill's will for the execution of\r\nthe trust reposed in them, and you will by an early opportunity receive\r\ndetailed instructions for your future proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, on the 9th April, 1816, Lord Bathurst forwarded to\r\nSir Gordon Drummond the following despatch containing the names of\r\nadditional Trustees and cancelling for obvious religious, political and\r\nracial reasons which would prevent criticism the former appointment of\r\nthe Governor:\r\n\r\n\"In my despatch of the 14th ult., I conveyed to you the instruction of\r\nHis Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, to nominate and appoint under the\r\nProvincial Act of 1801 a Body Corporate for the Advancement of Learning,\r\nand I communicated to you the names of several persons who appeared best\r\nqualified for such a duty. It has since appeared more advisable to\r\nincrease the number of Trustees to eight in order to obviate the\r\ninconveniences which if the number were less might arise from the\r\nnon-attendance of individual members. It has been deemed proper also in\r\norder to obviate all objections which might be grounded on the\r\ncircumstances of the peculiar situation in which with regard to this\r\ncommission the Governor is placed, to withdraw from that commission the\r\nname of the Governor or Officer administering the Government. You will\r\ntherefore take the necessary measures for inserting in the Patent the\r\nfollowing names in lieu of those which I have previously specified,\r\nviz.--Jonathan Sewell, Esq., Chief Justice of the district of Quebec;\r\nJames Monk, Esq., Chief Justice of the district of Montreal; the Right\r\nRev. Jacob Mountain, Bishop of Quebec; Rev. J. O. DuPlessis,\r\nSuperintendent of the Romish Church; the Rev. Dr. Alexander Sparke of\r\nthe Church of Scotland; John Richardson, Esq., of Montreal, a member of\r\nthe Executive and Legislative Councils; William Bachelor Coltman, Esq.,\r\nof Quebec, a member of the Executive Council; and John Reid, Esq., of\r\nMontreal, one of the Judges of the Court of King's Bench.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above instructions the Provincial Government was\r\nslow to act, for reasons already specified. Opposition to the\r\nestablishment of the Royal Institution continued to be powerful and\r\nsomewhat bitter, and two years passed before trustees were finally\r\nappointed. The Rev. J. O. DuPlessis, the Superintendent of the Romish\r\nChurch, objected to becoming a member of the Board, and later declined.\r\nMeanwhile vigorous efforts were made to have the grants for schools and\r\nthe McGill bequest augmented by the Crown, through the use of Crown\r\nLands or the revenues of the Jesuits' Estates as partly promised in Lord\r\nBathurst's letter of December 30, 1815.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these persistent efforts by some members of the\r\nLegislature and by church authorities interested in education, the Home\r\nGovernment realised that the funds devoted to educational institutions\r\nwere lamentably insufficient and that additional means should at once be\r\nprovided for the better equipment of schools and for the engagement of a\r\ngreater number of teachers. They seem to have realised, too, that the\r\nbequest of James McGill was not in itself sufficient to provide for the\r\nerection of College buildings and for a subsequent endowment. They\r\ntherefore decided after much consideration to make use of the estates of\r\nthe Jesuits which had reverted to the Crown on the extinction of the\r\norder. For several years the assigning of the revenues of these estates\r\nto educational and religious purposes under Protestant control had been\r\nadvocated and by the strange irony of history this was in time brought\r\nabout. Indeed, as early as February 10th, 1810, Sir Gordon Drummond,\r\nthen administering the Government of Lower Canada, wrote from Quebec to\r\nthe Colonial Office stating that the Anglican Cathedral in Quebec \"was\r\nbadly in need of repair and that for the purpose of repair there was\r\nlittle hope of obtaining from the inhabitants of Quebec any contribution\r\nworthy of consideration.\" He therefore asked that the Home Government\r\nshould authorise him to devote to the purpose part of the revenue\r\narising from the Jesuits' Estates, the whole of which \"to the amount of\r\nmore than £4,500 annually has hitherto been transferred to the Military\r\nchest.\" And he added, \"I beg leave to suggest my opinion that this is\r\nthe most proper source from which the means of repairing the cathedral\r\ncan be drawn, and indeed, that this fund might with propriety in the\r\nfuture be applied to the general support of the places of worship of the\r\nEstablished Church throughout the Province.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this request, however, no immediate action was taken, for\r\nalthough the Home Government had a legal right to dispose of the Estates\r\nas they saw fit, they naturally wished to proceed slowly and tactfully\r\nin order to avoid religious friction or bitterness within the Province.\r\nIn 1815, when, as already pointed out, it was intimated by the Colonial\r\nOffice that the Jesuit Estates might possibly be appropriated in aid of\r\nthe McGill bequest, there seems to have been no intention to limit the\r\nassistance which should be provided by this increased revenue to McGill\r\nCollege alone. On the contrary, the object appears to have been to use\r\nthe additional funds in order that, irrespective of race or creed, the\r\nbenefits of education might be diffused as widely as possible throughout\r\nthe country. But delay again followed, and it was not until the next\r\nyear that definite instructions were issued by Lord Bathurst for the\r\ntransfer of the Jesuits' Estates to the Royal Institution for the\r\nAdvancement of Learning. These instructions were contained in the\r\nfollowing historic letter, destined to have so large a part in the\r\nestablishment of McGill College and in Canadian education, and forwarded\r\nto the Officer Administering the Government of Lower Canada by Lord\r\nBathurst from Downing Street on May 10th, 1816:\r\n\r\n\"I have already expressed to you the gracious intention of His Royal\r\nHighness, the Prince Regent, to forward the extension of education in\r\nthe Provinces of Canada and I have pointed out the preliminary measures\r\nnecessary on your part to give effect to that intention. In furtherance\r\nof this object, I have received the commands of His Royal Highness to\r\ninstruct you to transfer to the Trustees of the Royal Institution for\r\nthe Advancement of Learning all those estates which formerly belonged to\r\nthe Society of Jesuits, which, since the abolition of that order, have\r\nbeen vested in the Crown, in order that the Royal Institution for the\r\nAdvancement of Learning may possess present means for establishing and\r\nmaintaining the Seminaries which it may be necessary to found and may\r\npossess the revenue which cannot fail progressively to increase in\r\nproportion to the improvement of the Provinces and the consequent demand\r\nfor additional means of instruction.\r\n\r\n\"In transferring, however, those estates to the management of the Royal\r\nInstitution for the Advancement of Learning, you will retain for the\r\nfuture disposal of His Royal Highness the accumulation of the rents and\r\nprofits of preceding years which may be either in the hands of the\r\nReceiver of those estates, or which may have been by him paid to the\r\nColonial Government, and you will with as little delay as possible\r\ntransmit to me a detailed account of the amount of the Fund which has\r\nbeen so created.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the executors of the will of James McGill had been again\r\ninformed of the definite intention of the authorities to proceed with\r\nthe erection and endowment of a College at Montreal, and on May 13th,\r\n1816, John Richardson, one of the surviving executors, acknowledged on\r\nbehalf of himself and his colleagues receipt of the information in the\r\nfollowing letter, in which, remembering perhaps Lord Bathurst's letter\r\nof December 30, 1815, they emphasised the conditions imposed in the\r\nwill:\r\n\r\n\"We have the honour of receiving your letter of the 9th inst., written\r\nby command of His Excellency, the Administrator in Chief, to acquaint us\r\nthat His Majesty's Government have it in contemplation to erect and\r\nendow a College at Montreal and that it is their intention as soon as\r\nthe plan of this establishment shall be definitely settled, to call upon\r\nus as Trustees of the Will of the late Mr. McGill for the application of\r\nthe lands entrusted to us for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"And further desiring to be acquainted for His Excellency's information,\r\nwhat are the extent and advantages considered with reference to the\r\nobject proposed of the House and property of the late Mr. McGill in the\r\nvicinity of Montreal and whether the grounds are sufficiently extensive\r\nto have an adequate space for the formation of walks and gardens,--in\r\ncompliance with His Excellency's desire, we have to acquaint you that\r\nthe grounds above mentioned contain about forty-six superficial arpents\r\nin a very healthy, moderately elevated, and pleasant situation, well\r\nwatered, at a convenient distance from the city towards the mountain,\r\nand consequently appear to be sufficiently extensive and well calculated\r\nfor every purpose of the contemplated establishment. There are already\r\nupon the premises a good stone house of two and a half stories, a barn,\r\noffice, and a large garden, which may be applied to the residence of the\r\nPresident or some of the Professors or to other useful purpose connected\r\nwith the object in view.\r\n\r\n\"We have further to acquaint you for His Excellency's information that\r\nthe devise by the late Mr. McGill is upon several conditions, one\r\nwhereof is that 'one of the Colleges be named McGill College, or if only\r\none College should be selected, then that the said one shall be called\r\nMcGill College!' Another of the conditions is 'that it be erected upon\r\nthe tract so devised.'\r\n\r\n\"We therefore take the liberty of suggesting that it will be needful in\r\nforming the plan of the establishment to attend to these conditions so\r\nas to enable the Trustees to act in conformity to the trust reposed in\r\nthem by the will of the deceased.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years of inaction followed, and even after the trustees of the Royal\r\nInstitution were appointed, delay characterised the efforts of the\r\nauthorities. There seems to have been considerable disagreement between\r\nthe Home Government and the Provincial Government with regard to the\r\nexact objects for which the revenue of the Jesuits' Estates was\r\nintended, and on the method of distribution. The Home authorities would\r\nnot agree to assign any of the revenue to aid in the establishment of\r\nMcGill College. Finally, in 1819, Lord Bathurst directed the Duke of\r\nRichmond, the Governor-General, immediately to commence the building of\r\nMcGill College, and he authorised him to defray the expense which it\r\nmight in the first instance be necessary to incur \"from any funds which\r\nmight be in the hands of the Receiver of the Jesuits' Estates.\" But this\r\ninstruction was not carried out. Its object seems to have been merely to\r\nprevent the lapse of the McGill bequest in conformity with the expressed\r\ncondition of the will that the College should be erected within a\r\ndefinite time. Further, the proposed assistance from the Jesuits'\r\nEstates seems to have been an advance and not a gift. It is unnecessary\r\nhere to follow in detail the disagreement and the struggle arising from\r\nthe distribution of the revenue of these estates. For several years the\r\nsubject was one of controversy, and meanwhile the cause of education\r\nsuffered. In 1823 Lord Bathurst recommended to the Lords Commissioners\r\nof the Treasury that a loan of £50,000 at 4% interest should be granted\r\nto the Royal Institution, but this recommendation was not complied with.\r\nIn 1825 a system was proposed by Lord Dalhousie, and subsequently\r\nfollowed, by which the management of the estates was taken over by the\r\nInspector of the King's Domain under the control of the Governor in\r\nCouncil. He was allowed an agent in each district to collect the rents\r\nwhich were then turned in at stated periods to the Receiver General. For\r\nseveral years, however, particularly in 1830 and 1831, the question of\r\nassigning the revenues from the estates for the purpose of education was\r\nrepeatedly under discussion, but no pledge for such financial assistance\r\nwas given by the Home Government. At last, in 1831, the Home Government\r\nsurrendered the Jesuits' Estates to the Provincial Legislature, and\r\nagainst much opposition the schools were placed under the control of the\r\nHouse of Assembly. The salaries of teachers were greatly reduced; they\r\nwere granted on an annual vote on condition that instruction be given by\r\neach teacher to at least twenty pauper scholars. As a result, it was\r\nstated by those opposed to this new plan that \"the schools were nothing\r\nmore than places of cheap education for the children of people in the\r\nlower walks of life.\" But notwithstanding this criticism the schools of\r\nthe Province seem to have flourished to some extent at least under the\r\nnew system. But it should not be forgotten that the Jesuits' Estates\r\nwhich had so long been the subject of discussion and controversy had in\r\nthe end a very prominent part in the early history of McGill College. It\r\nwas because of the funds derived from them when all other sources of\r\nrevenue were exhausted that the trustees of the Royal Institution, and\r\nthe executors of the will of James McGill, were permitted to prove in\r\nthe courts the legality of the McGill bequest and to prosecute\r\nsuccessfully their claims to his Burnside estate.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Lord Bathurst's instructions to the Duke of Richmond\r\nin 1819, the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning proceeded\r\nto have the McGill property transferred from the executors of the will\r\nto their own control. They gave a power of attorney to S. Sewell, who\r\nsubsequently continued for several years to act on their behalf. But\r\ndelay again characterised the efforts of the Royal Institution, and it\r\nwas not until January 18th, 1820, that final application for the\r\ntransfer of the McGill estate was made to the three surviving executors,\r\nHon. John Richardson, Hon. James Reid, and the Rev. Dr. Strachan. The\r\nestate was then in possession of Francis Desrivières, the nephew of the\r\nfirst husband of Mrs. James McGill. He was occupying Burnside House,\r\nJames McGill's former home, and he was in control of the lands, products\r\nand rents of the estate. On receipt of the request from the Royal\r\nInstitution, the executors wrote to Mr. Desrivières on January 20th,\r\n1820, informing him that a University or College was about to be erected\r\nand established \"for the purpose of education as designated in the will\r\nand in conformity to the conditions therein presented,\" and asking \"when\r\nthe tract of land and premises now in your possession can be delivered\r\nover without subjecting you to unnecessary inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\nThis inquiry was the beginning of a long and wearying controversy which\r\nresulted in protracted litigation and ended finally in an appeal to the\r\nPrivy Council. The reply to the above request indicates that the\r\nDesrivières family was not inclined to give up the property without a\r\nstruggle. Francis Desrivières wrote, \"I beg leave to mention that when\r\nthe demand for the property in question is made by the Corporation\r\nreferred to [The Royal Institution], I will determine how far a\r\ncompliance with that demand ought to take place on my part.\" The\r\nexecutors forwarded this reply to the Attorney for the Royal Institution\r\nwith the comment \"you will perceive that it is evasive.\" They further\r\nstated their intention to proceed nevertheless with the conveyance,\r\n\"which, when completed, will be handed over to you; it will then rest\r\nwith your Corporation to pursue such measures as may be considered\r\nproper on the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessary papers for the transfer of the estate, but not the\r\nendowment fund,--from the executors of the will to the Royal Institution\r\nwere finally completed in May, 1820; on June 7th following, the\r\nconveyance was effected and the Deed was recorded on August 3rd. It was\r\nevident, however, to the executors that difficulties were in the way of\r\nsecuring possession of the property. In a letter to the Rev. Dr.\r\nStrachan, written on the 24th of May, 1820, the two remaining living\r\nexecutors, John Richardson and James Reid, said: \"We are sorry to say\r\nthat a general belief prevails, and we fear is too well founded, that\r\nMr. Desrivières, the residuary legatee, means to contest this bequest of\r\nhis venerable benefactor. If that shall be really his intention, it will\r\nspeedily be known by a refusal after a formal demand is made by the\r\nCorporation for the delivery of possession of the aforesaid grounds and\r\npremises,--whereupon a suit will be instituted against him in the\r\nOctober term.\" To this letter Dr. Strachan replied, \"I should hope that\r\nMr. Desrivières will have a greater respect for the memory of his\r\ngreatest benefactor than to contest a Legacy which goes to establish an\r\ninstitution which he had so much at heart.\"\r\n\r\nThat the \"general belief\" and the fears above referred to were not\r\ngroundless was soon apparent. Formal application for the vacating and\r\nthe giving up of the estate was made by the trustees of the Royal\r\nInstitution. The application was curtly refused. Francis Desrivières was\r\nin possession of the estate and he determined to remain in such\r\npossession until the Courts should decide otherwise. His solicitors\r\nbased their claim, on his behalf, on the plea that a college had not yet\r\nbeen erected, that no steps had been taken towards its erection, that\r\nthere was no intention to proceed with its establishment, and that it\r\nwas now too late to comply with the conditions of the will with\r\nreference to time. With respect to the endowment fund, they claimed that\r\nthey were not obliged to pay it until a college had been actually\r\nerected as provided in the will. As a result of these claims, a suit was\r\nat once instituted in the Courts by the Royal Institution for the\r\npurpose of obtaining possession of the estate, and on October 3rd, 1820,\r\nthe Board passed a resolution authorising their attorney, Mr. Sewell, to\r\nsecure the aid of Mr. Stuart as counsel in the case. Mr. Sewell\r\nsubsequently had the assistance of Mr. Ogden, Mr. Vallières de St. Real,\r\nMr. Griffin, and Mr. Cochrane.\r\n\r\nThe Board soon realised that if their suit was to be carried to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion they must have funds to meet necessary expenses.\r\nThey applied to the Governor-General for financial assistance, and as a\r\nresult a sum of £200 was advanced to them as a loan, from the proceeds\r\nof the Jesuits' Estates. They realised, too, that it was necessary at\r\nonce to give the College some semblance of organisation. Their\r\nsolicitors advised the securing of a Charter without delay, and on\r\nFebruary 7th, 1821, the Secretary of the Board wrote to Mr. Sewell,\r\nstating that \"application for a Charter will be made to His Majesty's\r\nGovernment without loss of time, but it is the unanimous opinion of the\r\nBoard that the case should proceed.\" The Charter [here included as\r\nappendix B] received the sanction of the Crown on March 31st, 1821, and\r\nformed the basis of the court plea of the Royal Institution. Two years\r\nlater the Board decided to secure a teaching staff, and by 1824 they had\r\nappointed a Principal, who was to be also Honorary Professor of\r\nDivinity, and four Professors. The latter held merely _pro forma_\r\nappointments, and were intended to fulfil a technical legal requirement;\r\nnone of them ever lectured in the University, and when the College was\r\nactually opened five years later those who still remained willingly\r\nresigned to leave the Governors free to fill all Professorships as they\r\ndesired. But the fact of their appointment doubtless helped the Board in\r\nthe suit then pending.\r\n\r\nIt is needless here to outline in detail the litigation that followed.\r\nIn answer to the Desrivières claim, the Board contended that, as\r\nrequired by the testator, McGill College had now been, to all intents\r\nand purposes, erected and established by Letters Patent under the Great\r\nSeal, and by the appointment of Professors. All the conditions of the\r\nwill had therefore, they said, been fulfilled. Accordingly on November\r\n8th, 1821, they made a formal demand upon the executors, the Hon. John\r\nRichardson and the Hon. Justice Reid, for the transfer of the legacy of\r\n£10,000 with interest due since the death of the testator. Francis\r\nDesrivières was in possession of this money, and on December 4th, 1821,\r\nthe executors called on him for its payment. He replied that it would\r\nnot be paid until the college had been built and established, as the\r\ncase connected with property only had not yet been decided, and he did\r\nnot regard the mere obtaining of a Charter as fulfilling the conditions\r\nof the will. As a result the executors and the Board issued instructions\r\non December 26th, 1821, for the instituting of a second suit to obtain\r\npossession of the endowment fund, and the two suits proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the first case was long delayed, and was attended with\r\nnumerous discouragements. It involved, too, great expense, which the\r\nBoard was not always able to meet. The judgment of the Court of King's\r\nBench in Montreal was in favour of the Royal Institution. Mr.\r\nDesrivières then appealed from this judgment to the Privy Council, and\r\nagain an irritating delay ensued before the appeal was heard. In July,\r\n1823, the Board asked the Governor-General for a further loan of £300\r\nfrom the revenues of the Jesuits' Estates as they were again in\r\nfinancial straits. The advance was made, but it was soon expended, and\r\nwhen forwarding a payment on account to Mr. Sewell on April 15th, 1824,\r\nthe Secretary of the Board wrote, \"this payment exhausts within a few\r\npounds all the money of the Royal Institution. We are therefore in no\r\nvery enviable situation as to funds.\" Four more years passed before the\r\nfirst suit was finally settled; they were years during which in the face\r\nof obstacles that threatened the very existence of the College, the\r\nBoard frequently despaired of success. On August 17th, 1824, the\r\nSecretary wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, Sir F. N.\r\nBurton, pleading for his assistance and co-operation in bringing the\r\ncase to a speedy conclusion, and asking for further financial\r\nassistance. The following extract from his letter indicates that the\r\noutlook was not entirely hopeful:\r\n\r\n\"The judgment of the Court of King's Bench at Montreal in favour of the\r\nInstitution in suit against Mr. Desrivières has been confirmed by the\r\nCourt of Appeals; but a further appeal has been made to the Privy\r\nCouncil; the sum of £300, advanced by way of Loan, by order of His\r\nExcellency, the Governor in Chief, in consequence of the address above\r\nreferred to (in addition to £200 before received), from the proceeds of\r\nthe Estates heretofore belonging to the late Order of Jesuits' has been\r\nsubsequently expended. Your Excellency is likewise aware that not only\r\nis a question arising out of these complicated legal proceedings now\r\npending in the Court of Appeals, but also that the action for the\r\n£10,000 which promises to be at least as expensive to the Institution as\r\nthat for the Estate of Burnside, is as yet undecided in the Court of\r\nKing's Bench at Montreal. Of the final result of these proceedings no\r\ndoubt can reasonably be entertained; but the Institution have before\r\nthem in the meantime the prospect of protracted Litigation without any\r\nmeans whatever of meeting the heavy expense attendant upon it,--or even\r\nof defraying their ordinary contingent expenses, however trifling their\r\namount. In these circumstances of unexampled difficulty, the Institution\r\nonce more humbly pray that your Excellency in transmitting their\r\nMemorial to His Majesty's Government, will be pleased to accompany it\r\nwith such representations as to your Excellency may seem best calculated\r\nto relieve them from the extreme embarrassment of their situation; from\r\nwhich, if it is not speedily extricated, not only must all hope be\r\nrelinquished of the actual establishment of McGill College, already\r\nerected by the Royal Charter, but their operations must be suspended\r\naltogether and their very existence as a Corporation virtually cease.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply to this letter was unfavourable, or at least indifferent, and\r\non November 14, 1824, an appeal was made for a grant or a loan of £50\r\nfrom the revenues of the Jesuits' Estates. Finally, towards the close of\r\n1828, the judgment previously given in favour of the Royal Institution\r\nwas confirmed by decree of the Privy Council in Appeal, and early in\r\n1829 the Burnside Estate was given into the Board's possession. The suit\r\nin connection with the endowment fund was still pending. Because of the\r\njudgment given in the first suit, there was no doubt, however, about its\r\nultimate result, but it was not finally settled by the Privy Council in\r\nfavour of the Royal Institution until 1837.\r\n\r\nWhen the Board took possession of the Burnside Estate they decided to\r\nlease to a farmer named O'Connor, the farm and garden for one year, \"on\r\nthe halves,\" on condition that the lease could be cancelled by the Board\r\non three months' notice. The leasing of the property was frequently the\r\ncause of controversy and annoyance. O'Connor contracted a bill for\r\ngarden seeds amounting to over £3. He was unable to pay it and the seed\r\nmerchant held the Estate liable, as the products of the seeds had\r\nimproved the property. There was a long and technical discussion, until\r\nat last the bill was paid from the proceeds of the sale of wood from\r\napple trees O'Connor had cut down, apparently to end the trouble. On the\r\nwhole, the leasing was for a time profitable to the Board, but it was\r\nnot always attended with harmony. Later, the land was leased to another\r\nfarmer named Kelly for seven years, on condition that the lease could\r\nbe surrendered on four months' notice, \"and that Kelly should cut down\r\nthe poplar trees.\" Subsequently, the estate was leased in smaller\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen the claims then before the courts for the\r\npossession of the endowment fund, it was desirable actually to open the\r\nCollege in Burnside House as speedily as possible. It was decided that\r\nthe opening should take place on Wednesday, the 24th of June, 1829, and\r\nnotification of this intention was published in the press. In April a\r\ncommittee of the Board was appointed to draw up a Code of Statutes for\r\nthe government of the College. The Rev. Archdeacon Mountain, son of the\r\nPrincipal of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning, had\r\nbeen appointed Principal of the proposed University five years before.\r\nBut no arrangements had been made for the future. There was apparently\r\nbut little promise of a grant from the Government, and until the second\r\nsuit should be settled in the courts and money thereby made available,\r\nit was obvious that all plans must be indefinite. The future would, it\r\nwas hoped, take care of itself; the main object to be considered for the\r\npresent at least was the opening of the College. With that accomplished,\r\nand the endowment fund paid, all difficulties, it was thought, would\r\nvanish, and the College would go forward to its intended place. But\r\nbefore it lay troubled years of uncertainty and anxiety. It was only the\r\nfirm determination and the undefeated optimism of those who believed in\r\nits destiny that kept it from being merely the hope or the dream of a\r\nScottish pioneer rather than a place of everlasting influence in our\r\nnational life. The struggle of those years was not always without great\r\ndisappointment, and even bitterness. But the product that emerged from\r\nthe turmoil was perhaps greater and stronger for that fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGE OPENED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Principal who guided McGill College in its infancy and for six years\r\nafter its opening, was the Rev. George Jehosophat Mountain. He was\r\nappointed to the Principalship in 1824, while the University was a name\r\nonly. The family from which he was descended had won distinction in\r\neducation and in the church, and it was fortunate that the young College\r\nshould be cradled under the care of a guardian of his learning, his\r\ntraditions and his breadth of vision. His father, the Rev. Jacob\r\nMountain, was given livings by the younger Pitt in Lincolnshire and\r\nHuntingdonshire in England, and later a prebend's stall in Lincoln\r\nCathedral. When a diocese was created in Canada his name was at once\r\nsuggested, because of his success at home, and in 1793 he came to Canada\r\nto become the first Anglican Bishop of Quebec. He subsequently acted as\r\nPrincipal of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning and\r\nas such he had an active part in the educational affairs of the\r\nProvince. His son, George, was born in England in 1789 and when he\r\narrived in Canada with his parents he was but four years old. He\r\ntherefore justly regarded himself as a Canadian. He received his early\r\neducation in Quebec and continued his studies in England, where he took\r\nhis B.A. degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. He then returned to\r\nCanada and assisted his father as Secretary until he was ordained in\r\n1816, at a time when the establishment of McGill College and the methods\r\nof fulfilling James McGill's desire were under discussion. In 1817 he\r\nbecame Rector of Quebec, and in 1821 Archdeacon of Lower Canada. When in\r\n1824 the Board of the Royal Institution found that it was necessary, in\r\norder to secure the McGill bequest, to appoint Professors to the\r\nproposed College they selected Archdeacon Mountain as Honorary Professor\r\nof Divinity and Principal of McGill College. But he gave no lectures and\r\nreceived little or no remuneration for his work. His duty seems to have\r\nbeen mainly to preserve the forms which the terms of the will required.\r\nHe laid the foundation for the creation of the Faculty of Arts, and\r\nwhile he believed that instruction should be given in a manner\r\nconsistent with the English National Establishment, he desired that the\r\nUniversity should be open to students of all creeds with equal\r\nprivileges and that Professorships should be tenable by graduates of the\r\nScotch Universities. He retained the Principalship until 1835, when he\r\nretired, to return for a time to England. It is unnecessary here to\r\nfollow in detail his subsequent career. In 1836 he was made coadjutor of\r\nDr. James Stewart, Bishop of Quebec and became thereby Bishop of\r\nMontreal, the consecration ceremony being performed at Lambeth. After\r\nhis retirement from the Principalship he continued, as we shall see, to\r\ndevote much time and attention to the affairs of the growing University\r\nas a Governor, and he lived to see the College of which he was the first\r\nguardian advance to growth and usefulness even far beyond his dreams.\r\nDuring his last years he occupied the Anglican See of Quebec, where he\r\ndied in 1863.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rev. George Jehosophat Mountain_ 1789-1863\r\n_First Principal of McGill University_ 1829-1835]\r\n\r\nThe ceremony which marked the official opening of McGill University was\r\nheld on Wednesday afternoon, June 24th, 1829. It had been advertised in\r\nthe press for some time, and in addition special invitations were sent\r\nout to many citizens interested in educational advancement. It was\r\ntherefore attended by what the contemporary press called a gathering of\r\n\"numerous and respectable individuals.\" Because of the historical\r\nimportance of this meeting, the report of it, which appeared in the\r\n_Montreal Gazette_ in the issue of Monday, June 29, and which is similar\r\nin its details to the Governors' minutes of the meeting, is here given\r\nin full:\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of a notification having been published--that this\r\nCollege would be opened, and that formal possession of the estate of\r\nBurnside, upon which it was established, would take place on Wednesday,\r\na very numerous assemblage of the inhabitants of this City were present\r\nat what we consider to be one of the most important and interesting\r\nceremonies lately witnessed in this part of the Province. Though there\r\nwas none of the gaudy appearance and display characteristic of religious\r\nor Masonic Processions, yet to the mind of the philosopher and friend of\r\neducation, the simple and appropriate ceremony, an account of which we\r\nare about to lay before our readers, presented more charms than if\r\ndecked out with all the pageantry of chivalry and romance.\r\n\r\n\"A large room in the house which has been for some time existing on the\r\nestate having been fitted up, it was soon after one o'clock filled by\r\nthe numerous and respectable individuals who had assembled to witness\r\nthe ceremony. Among the company we noticed several officers of the\r\ngovernment, the principal members of the Bar, the lecturers at the\r\nMontreal Medical Institution and several gentlemen, more or less\r\nconnected with the proposed College.\r\n\r\n\"The Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, attended by the Rev.\r\nG. J. Mountain, D.D.; the Rev. J. L. Mills, D.D.; the Rev. B. B.\r\nStevens, A.M.; the Rev. A. Norman; and the Rev. A. F. Atkinson of\r\nMontreal; the Rev. James Reid of St. Armand; the Rev. W. Abbott of St.\r\nAndrews; the Rev. J. Abbott of Yamaska; the Rev. I. Braithwaite, A.B.,\r\nof Chambly, and the Rev. H. Esson, and E. Black of the Kirk of Scotland\r\nin Montreal having entered the Hall, the business of the day was soon\r\nafter proceeded upon.\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Charter incorporating the Governors and Professors of the\r\nUniversity being placed on the table, His Lordship the Bishop of Quebec\r\nrose and addressed the assembled body. He stated that in consequence of\r\nthe absence of His Excellency the Administrator of the Government, who\r\nwas one of the Governors of the corporation of McGill College, it became\r\nincumbent on him to make a few remarks on the present occasion. He\r\nwould, however, first state that he was commissioned by His Excellency\r\nto express his regret that in consequence of the very late arrival of\r\nthe April and May mails he was unable to leave Quebec in time to assist\r\nat the ceremony of promulgating the charter which had been conferred on\r\nthe College. His Excellency in his letter was pleased to add that he\r\nwould not fail to use all his exertions to promote the Institution.\r\nHaving fulfilled this duty, the Lord Bishop begged to observe that the\r\nbequest which had been made in favour of this College by the late Hon.\r\nJames McGill consisted of the valuable estate of Burnside, comprising\r\nthe building in which they were then assembled, and the garden and\r\ngrounds adjoining, together with the sum of £10,000, in furtherance of\r\nhis benevolent intention. This liberal bequest was made in 1811 (two\r\nyears previous to the death of Mr. McGill), in trust to a corporation\r\ncalled the Royal Institution which was contemplated by an act passed in\r\n1801. This Institution was to transfer the bequest, when a College, in\r\npursuance of his views, was established and bearing his name. To this\r\nmost benevolent legacy, he could not help referring as characteristic of\r\nits liberal donor, with whom he had the honour of an acquaintance, and\r\nas furnishing an example which he hoped to see more frequently followed\r\nin the Province. The late Mr. McGill, who had assumed a very\r\nconsiderable fortune within the country, did not, like many others,\r\nleave the Province and spend his money in some other part of the globe,\r\nbut having no direct heirs, he had left a very handsome legacy for the\r\nlaudable purpose of commencing a University in a country where such an\r\nestablishment was very desirable. The Institution was to bear the name\r\nof its excellent founder, and he firmly hoped that it might prove a\r\nblessing to many generations yet to come, that it might tend to\r\nimmortalise his name, and be the best monument that could be erected to\r\nhis memory. The Royal Institution was incorporated in 1818 and through\r\ntheir instrumentality, this College was in pursuance of the will of Mr.\r\nMcGill incorporated in 1821 by a charter which would be read to them.\r\nUnder that charter the Governors of the College were the Governor and\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper\r\nCanada, the Chief Justices of Montreal and Upper Canada, the Bishop of\r\nQuebec and the Principal of the College. It would be needless for him to\r\nrefer to the detentions and obstacles which had hitherto prevented the\r\nCollege from going into operation; it was known that they arose from the\r\nresiduary legatee under the will of Mr. McGill disputing the legality of\r\nthe bequest, and carrying his opposition through all the Courts of the\r\nProvince, till His Majesty in his Privy Council had finally given the\r\ndecision in favour of the Institution, whose duty it had become to\r\nprosecute for the recovery of the bequest. The suit in relation to the\r\nmoney bequeathed to the College was still before the Council, but he was\r\nhappy to say that that unfortunate dispute would soon be terminated as\r\nit was understood the residuary legatee intended to withdraw all further\r\nopposition. It was the intention of the Royal Institution to transfer to\r\nthe Governors of the College the property of Burnside, and on the part\r\nof the Governors, he was authorised to say that they were willing to\r\naccept of it. A majority of them were either now present or consenting,\r\nfor he was charged with the consent of the Governor of this, and the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the adjoining Province, both of whom had\r\nexpressed a desire to attend on the present occasion, and it was known\r\nthat there was now no Chief Justice in Upper Canada. On the part of the\r\nmajority, he accepted from the Royal Institution the Charter which the\r\nSecretary of that body would now read.\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Dr. Mills, Secretary to the Royal Institution for the\r\nAdvancement of Learning, then read at length the Charter of the College.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Bishop then again rose and said that he was authorised on the\r\npart of the Governors of the new College to state it to be their\r\nintention as far as it was in their power to carry into effect the\r\nliberal intentions of the late Mr. McGill. It was not a work in which\r\nthey themselves were solely interested, but it was an institution which\r\nconcerned every inhabitant of the Province, and under such feelings the\r\nGovernors were determined that no obstacles should deter them from\r\nfollowing up and prosecuting the views of the testator. He deemed it\r\nunnecessary for him to exhort them upon the advantages of education, as\r\nhe was sure they were all of opinion that a moral and religious\r\neducation on Christian principles, and a scientific course of studies on\r\na true philosophical system were what it was their bounden duty to\r\npromote. The Governors in assuming the Charter hoped that their\r\nexertions would meet with the co-operation of every individual within\r\nthe Province.\r\n\r\n\"The Venerable Archdeacon Mountain then rose, and stated that as the\r\nindividual named to fill the honourable office of Principal of the new\r\nCollege, it became his duty now to say a few words. He could not but\r\nexpress his sense of his own unworthiness for such a distinguished\r\noffice, and he firmly hoped that he would be succeeded by a long line of\r\neminent and learned principals. He had it in charge for his colleagues\r\nto state their anxiety to put the College into immediate operation, and\r\nhe might urge as a proof of their wish that they had not been idle in\r\nthis respect. With the assistance of the Honourable Mr. Cochrane then\r\npresent, they had been engaged in preparing and modelling a constitution\r\nand rules for the government of the Institution. Although it was not\r\nnecessary to detail at present their precise nature, yet he could take\r\nupon himself to state that they were liberal in every sense of the word,\r\nimposing no test upon Professors or Students. In thus applying the term\r\nliberal he wished it distinctly to be understood that he was not\r\nconveying the charge of illiberality against those noble and venerable\r\nInstitutions of the Mother Country, in which a test was properly exacted\r\nof conformity to the National Religion, but there were local\r\ncircumstances which required local adaptation; and according both to the\r\nterms of the will and the provisions of the Royal Charter, all offices\r\nwhatever in McGill College were left freely open either to Protestants\r\nor Roman Catholics, and Students of all denominations would be permitted\r\nto attend. He deemed it necessary for him to explain how the present\r\nProfessors happened all to be members of the Church of England. When\r\nfound necessary to name Professors in virtue of the Charter of the\r\nCollege, his late father, then Bishop of the Diocese, had submitted\r\nseveral names to His Excellency the Earl of Dalhousie for these offices,\r\namong which those of the Rev. Archdeacon Strachan and the Rev. Dr.\r\nHarkness, having been proposed as eligible, either one or the other, to\r\nthe same Professorship, His Excellency, whether swayed by a feeling of\r\ndelicacy and desire to avoid the appearance of partiality, on account of\r\nhis being himself a member of the Church of Scotland, or from whatever\r\ncause, decided in favour of the former gentleman. This circumstance was\r\nmentioned in proof that the original as well as the present intention of\r\nthe Governors was in all respects to shew due respect to the intentions\r\nof the will of Mr. McGill and the terms of the Charter. It had been\r\ndeemed necessary for the present to declare that the Professors should\r\nbe graduates of some British University, but that a preference should\r\nhereafter be shown to those who had graduated within its walls. The\r\nGovernors would feel it to be their duty under all discouraging\r\nobstacles to push on the great undertaking, and never to cease in their\r\nexertions for its prosperity. They hoped they would meet with general\r\nsupport and they trusted with confidence that they would be assisted by\r\nall, when the very liberal terms of the will and Charter were\r\nconsidered. It would be necessary for them to make a strong and powerful\r\nappeal to the Mother Country, and they also expected great pecuniary\r\nassistance from those resident near the establishment, and more directly\r\ninterested in its prosperity. They would as soon as possible establish a\r\nsystem of collegiate education, and there was a predisposition to\r\nengraft upon the College the well-known and respectable Medical\r\nInstitution now in existence in the city. The door of the building was\r\nat length open, and it was the duty of all to proceed with vigour. They\r\nmight at first complain of a great want of means for such an\r\nInstitution, for it required much to place it on a respectable footing,\r\nbut while they thus looked forward with confidence, they should not be\r\nunmindful that the Province was highly indebted to the very liberal\r\ndisposition of Mr. McGill, who had set such a praiseworthy example to\r\nhis fellow-citizens, whose duty it now became generally to aid his work\r\nand follow up his munificent views. The Archdeacon concluded his address\r\nby expressing his conviction that all who were present felt alike the\r\ndependence of every human undertaking for its success upon the blessing\r\nof Divine Providence, and would therefore be unanimously ready to join\r\nin the religious services with which it was proposed to conclude the\r\nbusiness of the day; and in which he accordingly proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"The 8th chapter of Proverbs, which had been selected as appropriate to\r\nthe occasion, was first read; after which the following verses selected\r\nfrom different Psalms were repeated in the way of alternation, the\r\nresponsive part being sustained by the other Clergy of the Church of\r\nEngland who were present.\r\n\r\n\"'The Lord hath been mindful of us and shall bless us: even he shall\r\nbless the house of Israel; he shall bless the house of Aaron.\r\n\r\n\"'He shall bless them that fear the Lord both small and great.\r\n\r\n\"'The Lord shall increase you more and more, both you and your children.\r\n\r\n\"'All the whole Heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the\r\nchildren of men.\r\n\r\n\"'The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n\"'Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou sendest a gracious\r\nrain upon thine inheritance, and refreshedst it when it was weary.\r\n\r\n\"'O pray for the peace of Jerusalem,--they shall prosper that love thee.\r\n\r\n\"'Peace be within thy walls, and plenteousness within thy palaces.\r\n\r\n\"'For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will wish thee prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"'Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek to do thee\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"'Except the Lord build the house; their labour is but lost that build\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"'Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give the praise;\r\nfor thy loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.\r\n\r\n\"'Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"'As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without\r\nend. Amen.'\r\n\r\n\"The Archdeacon then proceeded with the following prayers:\r\n\r\n\"'O blessed and eternal God, who by wisdom hast founded the earth and by\r\nunderstanding hast stretched out the Heavens--Father of Light and Author\r\nof every good and perfect gift, from whom we receive all that we have,\r\nand all that we are made capable of performing--upon whose pleasure both\r\nwe, and our works, and all creation depend--look down from the\r\nhabitation of thy holiness and glory, and favour the undertaking which\r\nis here before us; let thy blessing rest upon it; let the cloud and\r\npillar of thy presence go with us; establish the work of our hands upon\r\nus, yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. Our hope is in Thee\r\nand thou art able to do for us, in things temporal as well as spiritual,\r\nexceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think. Raise us\r\nmeans, we beseech thee, to provide for the wants of this Institution:\r\ndispose the hearts of men and order the course of events favourably\r\ntowards it: shed down the spirit of wisdom and of patient continuance\r\nupon those who plant and those who water, and do thou give the increase\r\nfrom on high. Sanctify all the instruction which shall hereafter be\r\ngiven and all the studies which shall be pursued in this Institution,\r\nand render them subservient to thy glory and the good of mankind. Grant\r\nthat all the stores of knowledge and science, which shall be here opened\r\nto the minds of youth, may form them to the greater love of thy holy\r\nname, and lead them to magnify thee in thy wonderful works. O righteous\r\nFather, who hast hid the highest of all knowledge from the wise and\r\nprudent of this world, and revealed it unto babes, grant that none may\r\nbe here spoiled, through philosophy and vain deceit, nor lifted up in\r\nhearts through the opposition of science falsely so called, but give\r\nthem grace to cast down imaginations and every high thing which exalteth\r\nitself against the knowledge of God, and to bring into captivity every\r\nthought to the obedience of Christ. Yet, O Lord, while they are\r\nsubjected to this gentle and blessed yoke, enrich this Institution, we\r\npray thee, with ample streams of all sound learning and science; and as\r\nwe are taught in thy holy word that the Lawgiver of thy ancient people\r\nwas learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and the blessed apostle\r\nSt. Paul, profited above his equals, as well in the studies of his time\r\nand people, as in the learned lore of the ancients at large--and as thou\r\ndidst miraculously supply to the first planters of our holy faith that\r\nknowledge which, under thy blessing, must now be acquired by labour and\r\nlength of time--grant that all beneficence and industry may be exerted\r\nin the endowment and enlargement, the furtherance and prosperity of this\r\nInstitution; grant that the grain of seed which is here sown may\r\nbecome, in process of time, a great and goodly tree; that Science and\r\nLiterature may spring up and flourish upon this dedicated spot, and bear\r\nfruit a hundredfold.\r\n\r\n\"'With these our prayers, O Father of Heaven and Earth, we offer up our\r\nhumble thanksgiving for all thy mercies manifested to us, and especially\r\nfor that thou didst put it into the heart of thy servant, the Founder of\r\nthis Institution, to provide, out of the means which thou hadst given\r\nhim, for so needful a work. And, alike in thanksgiving or prayer, we\r\napproach thy Throne in the prevailing name and through the powerful\r\nmediation of Jesus Christ, whose own holy words also we couple still\r\nwith our imperfect address.' The Archdeacon here repeated the Lord's\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\n\"Then followed the Prayer for the Church Militant, from the Liturgy,\r\nwith some adaptations to render it immediately applicable to the local\r\nauthorities and to the occasion of the day. The assembly was dismissed\r\nby a blessing pronounced by the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\"Before closing this subject, we deem it but justice to the Venerable\r\nArchdeacon Strachan, to state, that to that Reverend gentleman the\r\nProvince is greatly indebted for McGill College, as to his suggestions\r\non this subject, his friend and relative the late Mr. McGill lent a\r\nready and willing ear, and was induced to frame the bequest, which is\r\nnow about to be employed according to the intentions of its donor. To\r\nthat gentleman, we understand, is also due the very liberal arrangement\r\nwhich was announced by the Principal, with regard to the total absence\r\nof any tests for the admission of Professors or Students....\"\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony of formally opening the College and establishing the\r\nFaculty of Arts, \"as a place of liberal education,\" was ended and the\r\ngathering dispersed, the Governors of the College met in the late\r\nafternoon for the transaction of business. They received the Lecturers\r\nof the Montreal Medical Institution, who formally placed before them the\r\nplans for \"engrafting upon the College the well-known and respectable\r\nMedical Institution\" as already indicated in the report above. The\r\nscheme was acceptable to the Governors and the Montreal Medical\r\nInstitution became part of McGill University. The Governors' Minutes of\r\nthe meeting contains the following entry:\r\n\r\n\"The public business having been closed, the Governors of the\r\nCorporation held an interview with the members of the Montreal Medical\r\nInstitution, who had been requested to attend the meeting for that\r\npurpose. During this interview it was resolved by the Governors of the\r\nCorporation that the members of the Montreal Medical Institution (Dr.\r\nCaldwell, Dr. Stephenson, Dr. Robertson, Dr. Holmes) be engrafted upon\r\nthe College as its Medical Faculty, it being understood and agreed upon\r\nby and between the said contracting parties that until the powers of the\r\nCharter would be altered, one of their number only should be a\r\nuniversity professor and the others lecturers; that they should\r\nimmediately enter upon the duties of their offices. All of which\r\narrangements were agreed to.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Andrew Fernando Holmes, M.D., LL.D._ 1798-1850]\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Medical Institution owed its origin to the Medical Staff of\r\nthe Montreal General Hospital, which was opened to patients in May,\r\n1822. At that time there were no opportunities in Canada for the\r\nobtaining of medical education. Realising the existing and urgent need\r\nfor such training, certain members of the Hospital Staff gave courses of\r\nlectures to students during the winter of 1822-1823. Later, a memorial\r\nwas forwarded to the Lieutenant-Governor setting forth the necessity for\r\nthe foundation of a permanent school of medical education, and outlining\r\nplans for the establishment and incorporation of the proposed Medical\r\nInstitution. The reply to this memorial stated that an endeavour would\r\nbe made to give assistance to a Medical School, and as a result the\r\nMontreal Medical Institution was organised. It was opened in October,\r\n1824. Efforts were then made to secure its incorporation, and in 1826 a\r\nCharter was drawn up and forwarded through the Lieutenant-Governor to\r\nthe Solicitor-General for opinion or approval. A delay of several months\r\nfollowed, and it was not until 1828 that a reply was received. The reply\r\nwas not favourable to the Institution. The Charter was refused for the\r\nreasons that the School was not connected with any Seminary of Learning,\r\nand that it had no foundation or endowment. No degrees could therefore\r\nbe conferred and the Institution had no standing in law. Meanwhile the\r\nPrivy Council had given judgment in favour of the Royal Institution in\r\nthe first Desrivières suit in connection with the Burnside Estate, as\r\nalready recorded, and it was clear that a similar judgment in the second\r\nsuit in connection with the endowment fund was but a question of time.\r\nThe establishment of McGill College was assured, and arrangements for\r\nits opening had already been announced. It naturally occurred to those\r\ninterested in the Medical Institution that their problems of University\r\nconnection and of endowment referred to by the Solicitor-General could\r\nbe solved by \"engrafting\" the Institution on the proposed McGill\r\nCollege. They accordingly forwarded a memorial to the Government,\r\nsuggesting that the Lecturers in the Institution be appointed\r\n\"professors of the University to be established at Burnside near the\r\ncity.\" The Government referred the suggestion to the Board of the Royal\r\nInstitution to whom formal application was then made by the Medical\r\nbody. A committee of the Board was appointed to consider the question.\r\nThe Medical Institution pressed for a decision, and on February 16,\r\n1829, the Secretary wrote to Dr. Holmes, of the Hospital Staff, stating,\r\n\"The Committee to whom was referred the communication from the Montreal\r\nMedical Institution have not, I am sorry to say, yet made their report;\r\nbut I trust the business will be proceeded in very shortly, and I shall\r\nnot fail to inform you of the result without delay. Of this be assured\r\nthat there is every desire on the part of the Board to meet the wishes\r\nof the Institution as far as it may be found practicable to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board had in 1824 appointed Dr. Fargues of Quebec Professor of\r\nMedicine, but he expressed his willingness to resign in order to leave\r\nthe Board free to negotiate with the Medical Institution. On April 10th,\r\n1829, the decision of the Board was conveyed to Dr. Holmes, in the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n\"Referring to a former communication upon the subject, I lose no time in\r\ntransmitting to you the following Extract from the Report of a\r\nCommittee of the Royal Institution, to whom it was referred to consider\r\nwhat measures it may be necessary for the Board to take, on having now\r\nobtained possession of the Estate of Burnside.\r\n\r\n\"The Medical Institution at Montreal, connected at present with the\r\nMontreal Hospital, having solicited the aid and protection of the Royal\r\nInstitution, and expressed a desire to become a branch of McGill\r\nCollege, it is conceived that the gentlemen of that Institution might be\r\nwilling (in consideration of being so associated with a legally\r\nconstituted establishment) to execute gratuitously the duties of one or\r\nmore Professorships in the College, connected with the Faculty of\r\nMedicine. The Professorships being limited to _four_, it is obvious that\r\nthere can be only _one_ Medical Professor, and I am happy to inform you\r\nthat Dr. Fargues, having been solicited to resign, has consented to do\r\nso with the utmost readiness, and it is accordingly open to the\r\ngentlemen of the Montreal Medical Institution to recommend for the\r\nconsideration of the Governors of the College any one of their members,\r\nbeing a graduate in Medicine, as his successor.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this decision the Governors of the College agreed to\r\nappoint one of the Lecturers in the Montreal Medical Institution to the\r\nProfessorship of Medicine vacated by the resignation of Dr. Fargues.\r\nMeanwhile there was a misunderstanding between the Governors and the\r\nBoard over the number of Professors already appointed in 1824. The\r\nCharter provided for a Principal and four Professors; the Governors made\r\nthese appointments, but also made the Principal Honorary Professor of\r\nDivinity. The Board contended that five Professorships had thus been\r\ncreated and filled, contrary to the provisions of the Charter. On April\r\n22nd, 1829, Dr. Stephenson wrote to the Board on behalf of the Medical\r\nInstitution urging that the number of Professorships in the College be\r\nincreased to enable all the Medical Lecturers to be attached to McGill\r\nCollege. The Secretary replied on May 19th, 1829, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your letter of the 22nd ult., was duly submitted by me to the Board of\r\nthe Royal Institution, and I am directed to inform you in reply, that\r\nthe Board having carefully considered the subject, are of opinion that,\r\nas the matter actually stands at present, it is not in their power to\r\nprocure an augmentation of the number of professorships. They conceive,\r\nhowever, that the Medical Professor of the University might deliver\r\nLectures in one particular branch of the Science, and that the other\r\nDepartments might be conducted by gentlemen, who should be named\r\nLecturers in the College, as is the case with respect to the different\r\nbranches of Learning and Science, which are taught in the Colleges of\r\nthe Universities at home. The words of the Charter are evidently\r\nrestrictive. The College shall 'consist of a Principal and four\r\nProfessors,' and in this view of the subject the Board are supported by\r\nhigh legal authority. This limitation, for which it is difficult to\r\nassign an adequate reason, is much to be regretted. The Governors of the\r\nCollege have committed an oversight in some way or other. It had not\r\nescaped the previous notice of the Board. The Bishop, the Archdeacon and\r\nmyself intend visiting Montreal next month, when we shall have an\r\nopportunity of discussing the subject at full length. I have only now\r\nto add that we all of us, both as a body and as individuals, feel\r\ninterested in the success of the Montreal Medical Institution, and that\r\nwe shall be most happy if it can be in any way promoted by a connection\r\nwith McGill College.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the College was formally opened it was necessary for the Governors\r\nand the Board of the Royal Institution to wait for the final decision of\r\nthe courts on the possession of the endowment fund, which was still held\r\nby the Desrivières heirs. No money was available for salaries; no\r\nbuilding on the estate was suitable for classes. It was therefore\r\nconsidered impossible, for the present at least, to undertake actual\r\nteaching in the College. But meanwhile the Montreal Medical Institution\r\nhad received from the Royal Institution the \"aid and protection\" it\r\nrequired, and it continued to carry on its work and to give instruction\r\nto students as before, but with a definite connection with the\r\nUniversity as one of its Faculties. Pending the securing of the\r\nendowment fund which would make possible the putting in operation of the\r\nCollege proper, as provided for in the will, the Governors of the\r\nCollege therefore decided to appoint, temporarily, and without\r\nremuneration, the lecturers in the newly formed Medical Faculty to the\r\nfour professorships at their disposal, in order that degrees in at least\r\none department of the University could be conferred. To make this\r\npossible the Professors who had already been appointed in the Faculty of\r\nArts, and whose duties could not yet begin, willingly consented to\r\nresign. But before degrees could be granted it was necessary, under the\r\nterms of the Charter, to draw up statutes for the government of the\r\nUniversity, such statutes to receive the approval of the Crown. The\r\nStatutes, Rules and Ordinances for the Medical Faculty were agreed upon\r\nby the Governors; and were submitted to the Colonial Office by Lord\r\nAylmer on March 8th, 1832. The Royal approval was forwarded to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the Province in a despatch dated May 2nd, 1832,\r\ntogether with the confirmation of the appointment of William Caldwell,\r\nJohn Stephenson, Andrew F. Holmes and William Robertson of the Medical\r\nSchool to the four University professorships, \"without specifying at\r\npresent the precise nature of each Professorship.\" They received no\r\nremuneration from the College. Later, Dr. Stephenson acted for a brief\r\nperiod as supervisor of the Burnside Estate.\r\n\r\nThe Home Government's knowledge of the exact circumstances and terms and\r\neven the making of the Montreal Medical Institution into a Faculty of\r\nMcGill seems afterwards to have been somewhat hazy. On August 20th,\r\n1834, the Colonial Office wrote to Lord Aylmer, the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nsaying, \"It would appear from Sir James Kempt's Despatches of 1830, that\r\nit was contemplated to incorporate with the College an association of\r\nMedical Practitioners but that difficulties arose as to the selection of\r\nthe Governors ... but I do not gather from your despatch whether the\r\nincorporation of this association is still desired.\" He asked for a\r\nreport on the question--a question that had been decided five years\r\nbefore. It was pointed out in reply that the Montreal Medical\r\nInstitution no longer existed independent of the College and that the\r\nseveral Lecturers in that school now occupied all the four\r\nProfessorships provided for by the Charter. There was misunderstanding,\r\ntoo, as we shall see, between the Governors of the College and the Royal\r\nInstitution with reference to the temporary or the permanent nature of\r\nthe above appointments, three of which the latter Board had never\r\nratified, and of which they were apparently not informed. For several\r\nyears the tradition of a distinct Institution, as it had already been\r\nknown, continued. The Medical Faculty carried on its work more or less\r\nindependently of the College, although it was incorporated with it and\r\nwas legally a part of it, but because of tradition it was not always\r\nregarded as an integral part of the University. It was looked upon as a\r\nwell established teaching body now linked up with the new College. The\r\nRules and Ordinances of the University did not apply to the Medical\r\nFaculty, and for several years after the actual erection and opening of\r\nthe College buildings the students of the Medical School were not\r\nincluded in the statement of enrolment annually sent to the Home\r\nGovernment by the Visitor to the University.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May of 1833, four years after the opening of the College,\r\nthe first University degree awarded was conferred in the Faculty of\r\nMedicine on William Logie. On May 7th, 1833, Dr. J. Stephenson,\r\nSecretary of the Medical School, wrote to Principal Mountain with\r\nreference to the conferring of this degree:\r\n\r\n\"I am directed by the Medical Faculty of the University to inform you\r\nthat Mr. William Logie of Montreal, after having produced to the\r\nSecretary of the Faculty credentials entitling him, was examined, as the\r\nStatutes, Rules and Ordinances of the College direct, touching his\r\nClassical knowledge and then got a general examination on all the\r\nbranches of Medical and Surgical Science. The Medical Faculty found him\r\nwell qualified to practise Medicine and Surgery and accordingly have\r\nannounced to him that they will forward his name to the Governors to\r\nobtain the Degree of Doctor of Medicine and Surgery.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence I am directed by the Faculty to address you on the\r\nfollowing points:\r\n\r\n\"1st. That we will, with your approbation, have our Gowns made as that\r\nof a Bachelor of Laws except the Cowl.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. That we will have the Theses printed by Mr. Armour of Montreal.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. The Faculty desire to know how the degree will be conferred on the\r\n24th of May and the tenor of said Degree that they might be getting it\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the rules of that time, it was necessary for a student proceeding\r\nto a degree to defend before the members of Faculty a Thesis on some\r\npreviously approved topic. The Thesis was printed at the expense of the\r\nstudent. The rules provided, too, that \"the student be required to\r\nattend the Hospital during the time required by the Statutes, and to\r\nreceive clinical instruction from the Professors at the bedside of the\r\npatients.\" The legal power of the University to confer degrees on the\r\ngraduates of the Medical Faculty was questioned by rival authorities,\r\nand was later tested in the courts, but the legality of the degree and\r\nthe privilege of the holder to practise Medicine in the Province was\r\nupheld.\r\n\r\nThe Governors now decided that an effort should be made to begin actual\r\nteaching in the liberal Arts and Sciences as called for in the will of\r\nthe founder. They determined to appoint professors and to conduct\r\nclasses, temporarily, in Burnside House. At a meeting of the Governors\r\nheld on the 4th of January, 1834, at which were present Lord Aylmer,\r\nGovernor in Chief, The Lord Bishop of Quebec, and the Principal of the\r\nCollege, it was decided to ask that the Charter be amended, and that the\r\nGoverning Board of the College be changed to consist henceforth of the\r\nfollowing: The Governor in Chief, the Lieutenant-Governor or person\r\nadministering the Government; the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada;\r\nthe Lord Bishop of the Diocese; the Chief Justice of Montreal; the Chief\r\nJustice of Upper Canada; the Speaker of the two Houses of the Provincial\r\nParliament of Lower Canada; the Senior Executive Councillor residing in\r\nMontreal; the Archdeacon of Quebec; the Solicitor-General; the Principal\r\nof the College; the Rector of Montreal; together with four other\r\nGovernors to be named by the Governor in Chief, the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nor the person administering the Government under a power to be\r\nintroduced into the Charter to that effect. Efforts were made afterwards\r\nto have the Minister of the Church of Scotland added to this list,\r\nex-officio, but it was pointed out in reply that he was \"not conceived\r\nto have any perpetual capacity in law and thence cannot be an ex-officio\r\nGovernor.\" It was decided also that His Excellency be requested to\r\nrecommend to His Majesty's Government that power should be given in the\r\namended Charter to the Governors of the College to establish additional\r\nprofessorships from time to time, at their discretion, according to the\r\nexigencies of the University and the means at their command.\r\n\r\nIt was further resolved that in the meantime until endowments for\r\nProfessorships were available from the McGill bequest, \"gentlemen\r\nresident in Montreal qualified to give lectures should be appointed on\r\nthe same footing as the four Professors in the Medical Faculty and that\r\nthey should receive fees from their students ... with the duty annexed\r\nof delivering occasional lectures, fees being paid by those who will\r\nattend them according to a regulated scale, there being at present no\r\nmeans of endowing Professorships with salaries.\" Professors were\r\nrecommended for the following subjects: Classical Literature and\r\nHistory; Natural Philosophy and Mathematics; and Hebrew and Oriental\r\nLanguages--all to be appointed on the same footing as provided for by\r\nthe foregoing resolution. At this meeting, too, a recommendation was\r\nmade that a Vice-Principal should be appointed--or that one of the\r\nProfessors be empowered to act as Vice-Principal--because of the\r\nfrequent absence of the Principal on other duties. Later, the Chair of\r\nNatural Philosophy was separated from that of Mathematics. As a result\r\nof the Governors' decision an amended Charter was drawn up for\r\nsubmission to the authorities, providing, among other things, for an\r\nincreased number of Professorships. It was prepared by the Professors of\r\nthe Medical Faculty, but it was greatly altered by the Governors at a\r\nmeeting called to consider it. The Colonial Office to whom it was\r\nforwarded would not approve of it, and even the consideration of it was\r\nvery long delayed. The question was debated until January, 1837, when\r\nthe Colonial Office declared that it was impossible further to discuss\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1834, the occupation of the House and Premises of Burnside as\r\na \"Classical School\" was approved. But it was to be conducted by the\r\nProfessors in their private capacity and no provision was made for their\r\nmaintenance, and the occupation of the premises was to be subject to the\r\nconditions imposed by the Governors and the Royal Institution acting\r\nconjointly.\r\n\r\nThe Principal, Archdeacon Mountain, now expressed his desire to retire\r\nfrom office. Other duties were calling for his attention. Indeed, at\r\nintervals for several weeks in succession he had been obliged to take\r\nlittle part in the management of the University, for his presence as\r\nArchdeacon of Lower Canada was required in many places. Frequently, too,\r\nit was necessary for him to be absent from the Province for a\r\nconsiderable length of time. He felt, also, that he had been appointed\r\nPrincipal mainly for the purpose of putting the College in operation and\r\nthat his work was now done. The Governors then decided to offer the\r\nPrincipalship to the Rev. S. T. Wood of Three Rivers, and if he declined\r\nto accept it, to offer it to the Rev. Thomas Littlehales of Christ\r\nChurch College, Oxford. But neither of these men would agree to occupy\r\nthe proffered post; indeed, the former entirely ignored the Governors'\r\nletter. Archdeacon Mountain was induced to remain some months longer, or\r\nuntil a competent successor could be found. The Professorship of\r\nClassical Literature was offered to the Rev. James Ramsay, a graduate of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin; that of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy to\r\nMr. Alex. Skakel of King's College, Aberdeen; and that of Hebrew and\r\nOriental Languages to the Rev. E. Black, of the University of Edinburgh.\r\nDifficulties resulting from the Charter prevented these appointments\r\nfrom being actually made at that time. Because of irritating delays,\r\nthe somewhat hopeless situation brought about by the refusal of the Home\r\nGovernment to permit the increase of Professorships, and numerous other\r\ndifferences of opinion, trouble was now growing between the Governors\r\nand the Crown. At a meeting of the former held on November 14, 1834, at\r\nwhich were present Lord Aylmer, Governor in Chief, the Chief Justice and\r\nthe Principal, the Governor was asked to bring to the notice of the\r\nSecretary of State \"the great inconvenience which it is feared may\r\nresult from the necessity of referring to His Majesty's Home Government,\r\nas required by the Charter, every appointment of a Professor or even of\r\na Principal.\" This was the beginning of a bitter and prolonged\r\ncontroversy which did not end until 1846, and which involved the College\r\nin perhaps the gravest difficulty and uncertainty of its history.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the case against the Desrivières heirs, James McGill\r\nDesrivières, Henri Desrivières, Francis Desrivières, and Alex McKenzie,\r\nhad proceeded. Every effort was made to have the suit settled. On\r\nDecember 21, 1833, the Governors authorised the Medical Professors to\r\njoin them in a Memorial on the subject to the Home Government. The Board\r\nof the Royal Institution persistently urged haste, but delay followed\r\ndelay. At last, on February 7th, 1835, the Order in Council deciding the\r\ncase in favour of the Board was issued, but it was not forwarded until\r\nthe 21st of May. But notwithstanding the decision of the Privy Council\r\nthe heirs of James McGill were slow to accede to the demands of the\r\nRoyal Institution. On March 8th, 1836, the Secretary of the Board wrote\r\n\"as to Burnside we are extremely perplexed by the pertinacity of the\r\nheirs in resisting and threatening further resistance to the payment of\r\nany money on account of the debt due to the Royal Institution unless\r\nterms are granted them ... which ... members of the Board think that we\r\ncould not accept without rendering ourselves personally liable if any\r\nfurther loss should accrue thereby to the College. I should be strongly\r\ndisposed to try and borrow money to begin with, if I knew what tangible\r\nsecurity we could offer.\" A further delay resulted, and even after the\r\nsuit was settled the executors of the will hesitated to transfer the\r\nmoney to the Board or the Governors until the Home Government fulfilled\r\ncertain promises which they understood to have been made. It was not\r\nuntil October, 1837, that the case was brought to final conclusion. As a\r\nresult of delays, negligence, and unsatisfactory communications, the\r\nGovernors appointed a special agent in London to conduct their business,\r\nwith the frank comment, \"If documents are sent through the Public\r\nOffices to Great Britain by way of the Colonial Office, there will be no\r\nend to the delay.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1835, two months after judgment was given in favour of the\r\nBoard, Principal Mountain retired from office in order to proceed to\r\nEngland. Now that the possession of the endowment fund was assured he\r\nbelieved that the College would soon be without difficulties and that\r\nits infant days of helplessness had passed. The Principalship was\r\noffered to the Rev. S. J. Lockhart, M.A. (Oxford), Chaplain and\r\nSecretary to the Bishop of Quebec. He seems to have accepted the post,\r\nbut he never assumed the duties of his office. A meeting of Governors\r\nwas held in Quebec on November 18, 1835, attended by Lord Gosford, who\r\nhad meanwhile become Governor in Chief of Lower Canada, the Lord Bishop\r\nof Quebec, and the Chief Justice of Montreal. It was there resolved\r\n\"that the Rev. John Bethune, Rector of Christ Church, Montreal, be\r\nappointed Principal of the College _pro tempore_; and that it be\r\nconveyed to him that his appointment shall not interfere with any future\r\nappointment which the Governors of the College may see fit to make.\" The\r\noffice of Principal was accepted by Mr. Bethune on November 24th, 1835,\r\nin the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"I cordially accept the appointment which the Governors of McGill\r\nCollege have done me the honour to confer on me, of Principal of the\r\nInstitution _pro tempore_, under the explanation given to me by the\r\nChief Justice of Montreal of the following passage in your Lordship's\r\ncommunication 'that the appointment shall not interfere with any future\r\nappointment that the Governors of the College may see fit to make,'\r\nviz., that if the funds of McGill College should at any future period\r\nenable the Governors to offer the Principal a sufficient emolument to\r\nsecure his exclusive services to the Institution the present nomination\r\nshall not interfere with any such future appointment--but that the\r\npresent nomination is not to be cancelled to make room for any future\r\n_pro tempore_ appointment.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the six years that had passed since the formal opening of the\r\nCollege definite progress had been made. But apart from the activity of\r\nthe Medical School, which did not owe its origin to the University and\r\nhad merely changed its name, the progress was connected only with laying\r\nplans for the future and with securing adequate resources and a\r\ndefinite habitation. The Governors were harassed by litigation and by\r\nnot a little uncertainty; they were dismayed at times by the evident\r\nlack of sympathy and the discouraging indifference of officials of the\r\nHome Government. But they did not cease to hope, and they did not dream\r\nof abandoning their educational scheme. They would struggle on to the\r\nfulfilment of the founder's vision. It was the task of the newly\r\nappointed acting-Principal to carry out these plans and to take up the\r\nadministration of the University in one of the most difficult and\r\ncritical periods of its existence. The years that followed were to be\r\ntroubled years of poverty, anxiety and controversy, not unmixed with\r\nbitterness, during which, at times, extinction and oblivion threatened\r\nthe University's life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nANXIOUS YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Bethune, appointed acting-Principal of McGill in temporary\r\nsuccession to Principal Mountain on November 18th, 1835, was a Canadian\r\nby birth and education. His father, the Rev. John Bethune, a native of\r\nthe Island of Skye, Scotland, and a graduate of King's College,\r\nAberdeen, emigrated to America before the War of Independence. At the\r\nbeginning of the Revolution he served as Chaplain of a militia regiment\r\nfighting in the Carolinas on the British side; he was taken prisoner by\r\nRepublican troops, and after his release by exchange he moved with other\r\nBritish Empire Loyalists to Canada. He lived for a short time in Nova\r\nScotia, became Chaplain again of a Highland Regiment fighting in defence\r\nof Canada against Montgomery's Army, and when the War ended he settled\r\nin Montreal. Here he organised, as we have seen, the first Presbyterian\r\nCongregation in the City, and ministered to it from March, 1786, until\r\nMay, 1787. He then removed to Williamstown in the county of Glengarry,\r\nwhere he became minister of the Church of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rev. Dr. John Bethune\r\nActg. Principal of McGill University_\r\n1835-1846]\r\n\r\nThe future acting-Principal of McGill, the Rev. John Bethune, the\r\nyounger, was born at Williamstown, Glengarry County, in January, 1791.\r\nHe received his education at the school of the Rev. Dr. John Strachan\r\nat Cornwall, already referred to. After serving in the War of 1812, he\r\nentered the ministry of the Church of England, possibly through the\r\ninfluence of his former teacher, who left a deep impression on the minds\r\nand lives of all his pupils, and in 1814, he was ordained by Bishop\r\nMountain at Quebec. He was stationed for a time at Brockville and\r\nvicinity, and in 1818 he was made Rector of Christ Church, Montreal,\r\nwhere he remained for more than fifty years, eventually becoming Dean of\r\nthe diocese. He was acting-Principal of McGill from November, 1835,\r\nuntil May, 1846. He died in August, 1872.\r\n\r\nSoon after his appointment, the acting-Principal entered into\r\nnegotiations with the Board of the Royal Institution on the question of\r\nthe erection of a suitable building on the Burnside Estate for the\r\nreception and instruction of students, as required by James McGill's\r\nwill. The Medical lectures, the only lectures given in the name of the\r\nCollege, were given in a building far removed from the College property.\r\nThe College authorities did not even pay the rent of the building nor\r\ndid they pay the salaries of the Professors, and the School, except in\r\nname, and for its own protection and the privilege gained thereby for\r\nthe conferring of degrees, was still, to all intents and purposes, a\r\nprivate institution. Technically, it was contended, it was not a part of\r\nthe University at all. It was not situated on the Burnside Estate as the\r\nwill of the founder required, and it could not therefore be considered\r\nas fulfilling any of the provisions of the bequest. Even the legality of\r\nthe degrees conferred had been questioned, and had been accepted on the\r\nbasis of equity and intention rather than on that \"of justice and of\r\nfact.\" The Principal and Governors realised the force of these\r\narguments, and the necessity of removing the cause. The situation could\r\nonly be met, they believed, by the erection of a building or buildings\r\non the Burnside Estate, as the terms of the bequest demanded, and the\r\nGovernors urged immediate action. They pointed out that \"without\r\nprovision for resident students very little good can be expected to\r\nresult from the opening of the College, and without residence within the\r\nCollege for one or more professors it cannot be expected that resident\r\nstudents will be obtained.\" The acting-President of the Royal\r\nInstitution for the Advancement of Learning, A. W. Cochrane, wrote to\r\nPrincipal Bethune on January 11th, 1836, stating \"with respect to the\r\nmeasures proper to be taken towards the speedy erection of a College on\r\nBurnside property, it was my intention to have submitted to a meeting of\r\nthe Royal Institution which was fixed for Thursday next a proposal to\r\nadvertise for plans and estimates of a suitable building.... My own\r\nopinion is that a new building calculated for 40 students (_intimus_)\r\nwith a suitable public apartment and accommodation for two professors\r\nwould be sufficient for the present demands of the country (perhaps even\r\nbeyond what is necessary) and that at all events it would not be\r\njustifiable to exceed the expenditure of £4000 or £5000 out of the\r\nbequest for such a purpose at the outset. The present building, Burnside\r\nHouse, might be adapted to the residence of the Head of the College.\" He\r\nadded that, as promised in 1801, the Crown should give an endowment for\r\ngeneral education in the Province, in a way that would not rouse\r\npolitical or sectarian feelings. \"I should not,\" he said, \"wish to see\r\nthe question connected with the proceedings of any political\r\nassociation. If taken up in this general way, I think that some public\r\nmovement at Montreal in favour of it would not fail to have a good\r\neffect; but great caution and moderation are requisite.\" But the Board\r\nand the Governors could not agree on the kind of building required and\r\nover a year passed without any action on the part of either body.\r\n\r\nFurther difficulty arose in connection with the amended Charter of 1834,\r\nwhich had not received the approval of the authorities. Until it was\r\ngiven confirmation no additional professorships could be appointed. That\r\nit did not conform to the ideas of the Board of the Royal Institution is\r\nevident from a letter written to Principal Bethune by the President in\r\nJune, 1836. Objection was taken to making the Governors a self-elective\r\nbody, and the necessity of making it essential that the Governors or a\r\nmajority of them should be of the Protestant faith was also insisted on.\r\nThat the discord between the Governors and the Board which led in the\r\nend to unfortunate bitterness and disaster, was then developing is also\r\napparent in this letter. The President of the Board wrote: \"Whatever\r\nchanges are proposed to be made in the existing Charter must, I should\r\nconceive as a matter of course, be submitted for the consideration of\r\nthe Royal Institution, the Visitatorial body who are bound to see that\r\nthe views of the founder of the College are not defeated.\" The Governors\r\nthen decided to submit new amendments, and at a meeting held on November\r\n14th, 1836, attended by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice and\r\nthe Principal, the Charter recommended in January, 1834, was changed to\r\nread as follows: \"The Governors of the College shall consist of the\r\nGovernor in Chief of Lower Canada; the Right Rev. Charles J. Stewart,\r\nLord Bishop of Quebec and his successors, Bishops of Quebec; the Right\r\nRev. George J. Mountain, Lord Bishop of Montreal and his successors,\r\nBishops of Montreal; the Rector of Christ Church, Montreal, and his\r\nsuccessors of the said Church; a minister of the Church of Scotland\r\nresident in Montreal, to be selected for the purpose by the Presbytery\r\nof Montreal to be perpetually succeeded by a minister of the Church of\r\nScotland chosen in like manner; the Principal of the College; the Hon.\r\nJames Reid; the Hon. George Moffat; the Hon. Peter McGill; William\r\nRobertson, M.D.; William P. Christie; Samuel Gerrard and John Samuel\r\nMcCord.\" Authority was given to fill all vacancies by a majority vote of\r\nthe Governors, seven to constitute a quorum. It was stipulated that all\r\nGovernors of the College must henceforth be residents in the district of\r\nMontreal. The Chief Justice and the Principal agreed to the above\r\nchanges in the Charter, but the Governor of the Province \"declined under\r\nexisting circumstances to give any opinion on the subject, and his vote\r\nwas not recorded.\" It was also decided at this meeting that the rents\r\nfrom the Burnside Estate be expended on repairs and that the premises be\r\nplaced in the occupation and charge of the Principal for the time being,\r\nhe to keep them in a good state of repair. This latter decision was not\r\napproved by the Royal Institution and it gave rise to further\r\ncontroversy. Without the approval of the Board of the Royal Institution\r\nthe Governors forwarded their amendments to the Governor-General for\r\ntransmission to the Home Government, but at the request of the Board he\r\nstayed proceedings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the ultimate possession of the endowment fund was causing\r\nanxiety. The case was settled in favour of the College in 1835, but the\r\nGovernors were unable to secure the money. The Desrivières heirs who\r\nwere in control of the legacy demanded terms as we have already seen,\r\nbut their terms were refused. When the Executors at last secured\r\npossession of the funds they declined to convey them to the Royal\r\nInstitution until certain promised conditions were fulfilled by that\r\nbody acting for the Home Government. On November 10th, 1836, a memorial\r\non the subject of the legacy was forwarded to the Colonial Office by Dr.\r\nStrachan, one of the surviving Executors of the will of James McGill. He\r\npointed out that the original bequest had increased by the accumulation\r\nof interest to £22,000. This amount together with the Burnside Estate\r\nwould, he said, be transferred to the Royal Institution when two\r\nconditions were fulfilled--first, the contributing by His Majesty's\r\nGovernment towards the erection and endowment of the proposed\r\nUniversity, and second, the carrying out of the intention of the\r\ntestator, to which Dr. Strachan stated himself to be a living witness,\r\nthat the proposed College should be essentially Protestant. To this\r\nMemorial the Colonial Office replied that the will did not stipulate for\r\na contribution from His Majesty's Government towards the proposed\r\nUniversity, and added \"nor can we perceive any disposition on the part\r\nof the testator to impress on the Institution to which he so liberally\r\ncontributed a character of religious exclusiveness.... The testator did\r\nnot in his will either directly or indirectly introduce such a\r\ncondition, and adverting moreover to the even-handed liberality with\r\nwhich his bequests were distributed between the poor Catholic and\r\nProtestant inhabitants of Montreal, we apprehend it would be impossible\r\nto impose such a restriction founded on mere verbal testimony as to the\r\nintention of the testator.... His Majesty's Government cannot now advise\r\nHis Majesty to reconsider it for the purpose of narrowing the Charter of\r\n1821.\" In November, 1836, the Board conveyed to the Governors of the\r\nCollege the possession of the Burnside Estate, subject to the Board's\r\nsubsequent approval of all decisions affecting it. But the controversy\r\nbetween the executors and the Colonial Office over the conveyance of the\r\nfunds, which the heirs had not yet given up, continued for several\r\nmonths. It was not until October 20th, 1837, that the litigation finally\r\nended. In December following, a transfer of all monies, investments,\r\netc., was obtained by the Trustees of the Royal Institution, estimated\r\nat the value of £22,000, the amount of the legacy and accrued interest,\r\nand yielding an income of between £800 and £900. But in the meantime the\r\nCollege suffered and its progress was retarded.\r\n\r\nThere were other worries than those of buildings and charter and\r\nendowment fund. Since the College was opened in 1829 no repairs had been\r\nmade on the Burnside property. The buildings and fences were rapidly\r\nfalling into decay; the neighbours were complaining that the fences of\r\nBurnside had disappeared and that through the property cattle wandered\r\nat will to their lands and gardens, and the farmer who had leased the\r\npremises \"on the halves\" had neither the money nor the inclination to\r\neffect a remedy. There was also a demand for streets or roads through\r\nthe estate. The Governors had no money at their disposal; they must beg\r\nevery cent expended from the Royal Institution. The situation was\r\nincongruous. On December 17th, 1836, Principal Bethune wrote to the\r\nSecretary of the Board informing him that \"there is a demand on the part\r\nof the neighbours for fences, which on a close inspection are found to\r\nbe unserviceable with the exception of 170 cedar rails or rather logs\r\nwhich will serve by being split into two for rails.\" The neighbours, he\r\nsaid, preferred \"a fence 10 feet high, but they will be satisfied with\r\none 6 feet high.\" He also advised that the Royal Institution should join\r\nin the proposal of one of the neighbours, Phillips (who is remembered in\r\nthe present \"Phillips Square\"), \"a man difficult to deal with if\r\nthwarted by delay,\" for opening streets through the estate of Burnside.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this appeal the Board granted £75 to be expended on the\r\nbuildings and fences. The expenditure of this sum created further\r\nfriction between the Governors and the Board. The latter body was not\r\ninformed until February, 1837, of the Governors' decision at their\r\nmeeting on November 14, 1836, to put Burnside House and premises into\r\nthe occupation and charge of the Principal of the College. When they\r\nreceived the information they wrote to the Principal asking him what use\r\nhe intended to make of the estate. The Principal in his reply questioned\r\nthe authority of the Board, and said: \"With regard to the use intended\r\nto be made by the Governors of the House, the Governors do not conceive\r\nthemselves in any way accountable to the Board in this respect ... yet\r\nthey feel no objection to communicating it for the information of the\r\nBoard.\" To this letter the Secretary of the Board replied: \"The Board\r\nwas only originally induced to make the grant of £75 on the 14th of\r\nNovember last, for the repairing of the Burnside House and fences in the\r\nexpectation that the same would be made tenantable and be let to the\r\nadvantage of the Trust, and have learned with much dissatisfaction that\r\nthe House is to be occupied by the acting-Principal without any\r\nadvantage to the Trust; and a personal interest thereby given to him to\r\nprevent the College going into speedy operation; and that the Board do\r\nalso think it necessary to record their opinion that as the Visitors of\r\nMcGill College they are at all times entitled to inquire into the\r\nmanagement of the Burnside property, especially when a demand is made\r\nupon the Board for a grant of money to be laid out on the said property.\r\nIt was ordered [by the Board] that Mr. Bethune be further informed that\r\nunder the circumstances disclosed to the Board for the first time in his\r\nletter, the Board cannot feel themselves justified in advancing any\r\nfurther sums for the repairs on the Burnside property.\" The Principal\r\nanswered that the Board had no right to act in any matter affecting the\r\nCollege without consulting the Governors; that \"the Governors cannot\r\nrecognise the Visitatorial powers of the Board to the extent claimed\";\r\nand that the Board was \"illegally and unjustly detaining the funds.\" He\r\nemphasised his desire \"to effect a restoration of harmony and unanimity\r\nbetween all the parties\"; but it was clear that because of the rapidly\r\ngrowing friction and misunderstanding a crisis was not very far off.\r\n\r\nFor several months thereafter no meetings of the Governors were held.\r\nThe Rebellion of 1837 and the struggle for Canadian autonomy required\r\nall the attention and the energy of the Provincial authorities, and the\r\nsubject of Collegiate education was again somewhat neglected. But in\r\nMay, 1837, the Royal Institution announced to the Principal that they\r\nwere about to erect buildings for the University, and they asked for\r\nsuggestions which might guide them in calling for plans. But the\r\nPrincipal and Governors declined to make suggestions. They denied the\r\nright of the Royal Institution to undertake the erection of buildings,\r\nand they contended that the whole property and management of the affairs\r\nof the College devolved upon the Governors. They would therefore not\r\nsurrender into other hands what they conceived to be their own vested\r\nrights. They pointed out, too, that the case between the executors and\r\nthe Royal Institution for the possession of the funds was not yet\r\nsettled. The Board replied that until a College was actually erected\r\nthey were in control, under the terms of the will. They were somewhat\r\ninconsistent in their attitude. In the first suit against the\r\nDesrivières heirs for the possession of the estate they had pleaded that\r\nby the mere obtaining of the Charter the College was to all intents and\r\npurposes \"erected and established.\" The courts sustained their plea.\r\nNow, however, they repudiated their own former contention; they\r\nmaintained that the College had not yet been \"erected and established\";\r\nand that until buildings were actually constructed they had the sole\r\nauthority!\r\n\r\nDiscord continued to characterise the relations of the two bodies. The\r\nGovernors' meetings were usually attended only by the Principal and the\r\nChief Justice. The former had a double or casting vote in case of\r\ndispute. He was virtually in control. The Board of the Royal Institution\r\ndeclared that he did not represent the views of the Governors. Apart\r\nfrom the disagreements arising from a dual management, other causes\r\ncontributed to the bitterness of the controversy. The period was not\r\nconducive to harmony. Downing Street was not a name to conjure with, and\r\n\"Downing Street rule\" had become in Canada a synonym for indifference or\r\ncoercion. The suspicion that the Royal Institution was but the\r\nmouthpiece, or at least the meek and unprotesting agent, of Downing\r\nStreet only added to the irritation. The suspicion was not well founded,\r\nfor the Royal Institution did not willingly submit to dictation from the\r\nHome authorities. But a new and sturdy Canadian spirit was evident in\r\neducation as well as in politics. It was apparent as early as 1815 when\r\nDr. Strachan outlined his plan for a University and expressed his doubts\r\non the suitability of English methods in Canada. It had grown rapidly\r\nsince that time. The year 1837 was a year of turmoil, with a cry for the\r\nprivilege of solving Canadian problems in a Canadian way by those who\r\nwere familiar with the requirements and conditions, and were not\r\ndwelling thousands of miles away. In such a period, aside from the waste\r\nof time, it was doubly distasteful to the Governors and to those\r\ninterested in education to have to submit all appointments and all plans\r\nto the Home Government for ratification. The friction was, on the\r\nsurface, between the Governors and the Royal Institution, but its roots\r\nlay deeper. Its cause was not far removed from the cause of the\r\npolitical rebellion of the hour.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of somewhat discordant discussion the Principal\r\nfinally agreed to submit to the Board suggestions on the proposed\r\nbuildings, and on June 30th, 1838, he forwarded an outline of what he\r\nbelieved the College should include. He suggested that it should provide\r\n\"(1) Accommodation for 100 students, namely, 100 sleeping rooms, and 50\r\nsitting-rooms, two students in one set of apartments; (2) apartments for\r\nthe Principal, and Vice-Principal, and family, and for four other\r\nProfessors. The present house of Burnside might, he said, be adopted for\r\nthe residence of the Principal; (3) a College Hall which for the present\r\nmay be used both for lectures, exercises and refectory; (4) a Library;\r\n(5) a Chapel; (6) Steward's apartments.\" As an alternative to (3) he\r\nsuggested three lecture rooms with some adjacent small apartments. It\r\nwas proposed that prizes should be offered for the first and second best\r\nplans with specifications and estimates, not only for the buildings, but\r\nalso for the laying out of College grounds on the northwest side of\r\nSherbrooke Street \"in avenues and ornamental and kitchen gardens.\" It\r\nwas pointed out that this land consisted of about seventeen acres, and\r\nwas considered sufficient for the College grounds, and that the upper\r\nside of Sherbrooke Street, which was then being opened to the width of\r\n80 feet, was considered the best site for the College, as it was the\r\nmost elevated land on Burnside and had the best approach. It was desired\r\nthat the Building should include \"a large room for the business of the\r\nProfessor of Latin and Greek which might also be appropriated to many\r\ngeneral purposes; a room for the Professor of Mathematics, Natural\r\nPhilosophy and Astronomy with suitable adjacent apartments for his\r\napparatus; a room for the Medical Department with suitable adjacent\r\napartments for Chemical apparatus.\" The Professorships proposed to be\r\nestablished in the first instance were four: that of Divinity and Moral\r\nPhilosophy to be occupied by the Principal; that of Medicine, with a\r\nsuitable number of Lectureships in the different departments of Medical\r\nScience; that of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Astronomy; and that\r\nof Latin, Greek and History. It was pointed out that \"in the present\r\nstate of the College funds the greater number of these Professors can\r\nhave little more allowed them than the fees derivable from pupils and\r\nthat their salaries will therefore be uncertain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution refused, however, to proceed at that time with the\r\nerection of buildings on so large a plan as suggested. On August 1st,\r\n1838, they announced their intention to \"proceed immediately on such an\r\nextent as the limited resources at their command will justify.\" They\r\nagreed to call for plans for a building containing lecture rooms and a\r\npublic hall, but no apartments for students or professors, the building\r\nto cost not more than £5000. They contended that all the money in their\r\npossession was required to endow professorships and that they could not\r\ntherefore make so great an expenditure as the large building suggested\r\nby the Governors would entail. They stated, too, that only three\r\nprofessorships could at present be established, those of Classical\r\nLiterature, Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, and Metaphysical and\r\nMoral Philosophy, on the understanding that when the charter was\r\nchanged to permit it, each of these professorships should be divided\r\ninto two. They pointed out that their University scheme \"in the absence\r\nof the long hoped for assistance from Her Majesty's Government will not\r\nembrace either Theology, Law, or Medicine.\" It was stipulated that the\r\nPrincipal should be also one of the Professors. An interesting condition\r\nwith reference to the teaching of Theology was also set forth by the\r\nBoard in the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That it is not expedient that a Professor of Divinity be appointed\r\nunder the Charter, but that it be intimated to the Right Reverend the\r\nLord Bishop of Montreal on behalf of the Church of England in this\r\nProvince and to the Reverend the Presbytery of Quebec or the Synod of\r\nCanada on behalf of the Church of Scotland that Lecture Rooms will be\r\nset apart and that application will be made for such an alteration in\r\nthe Charter as will give all rights and privileges of the University to\r\nsuch Professor or Professors as they may appoint and endow, or procure\r\nendowments for, for the instruction of students of Divinity of their\r\nrespective churches; and that the authorities in both churches be\r\nrespectfully requested to recommend or to enforce on their students\r\nattendance on the classes of general education in the College.\"\r\n\r\nIt was later decided that the Board of the Royal Institution and the\r\nGovernors of McGill should write a memorial to Her Majesty's Government\r\nasking for the means of endowing at least four Medical Professorships;\r\nthat a similar memorial be prepared with respect to a Professorship of\r\nLaw; and that until such Professorships be established, every facility\r\nbe given within the College to Lecturers in the various branches of\r\nMedical and Legal Science. These memorials had no response.\r\n\r\nAnother effort was now made by the Governors to secure the passing of\r\nthe new Charter as amended in 1834 and 1836, which had been ignored by\r\nthe Home Government. But Lord Gosford, the Lieutenant-Governor, refused\r\nto give it his sanction. Application was then made to Lord Durham, but\r\nno answer was received from His Lordship, who declared that he was \"too\r\nbusy to consider the question.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondence during this period indicates that the Board and the\r\nGovernors were working in harmony. But the peace was not of long\r\nduration. It lasted but a few days. It was, however, of sufficient\r\nlength to permit of temporary agreement on the kind of building\r\nrequired. As a result, plans for the laying out of the grounds and for\r\nthe erection of buildings were at last called for by the Board of the\r\nRoyal Institution, and the following advertisement appeared in the\r\n_Mercury_ and the _Official Gazette_ on the 16th of August, 1838, and in\r\nthe _Quebec Gazette_ on the day following:\r\n\r\n                   TO ARCHITECTS\r\n        OFFICE OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION FOR THE\r\n               ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING\r\n\r\n                                  Quebec, 16th August, 1838.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Principal and Trustees of this Board, Public Notice is\r\nhereby given that they are desirous of obtaining plans, specifications,\r\nand estimates for the erection of suitable buildings on the estate of\r\nBurnside, near Montreal, for the McGill College; and that the sum of\r\nfifty pounds currency will be paid for the plan which shall be accepted\r\nby the Board as the best plan; and twenty-five pounds for the plan which\r\nshall be adjudged as second best. The said plans to provide:\r\n\r\n1ST. Apartments for 100 students: to consist of 50\r\n       sitting rooms and 100 sleeping rooms.\r\n\r\n2ND. Apartments for a Vice-Principal and family,\r\n       and for 4 Professors.\r\n\r\n3RD. College Hall.\r\n\r\n4TH. Library.\r\n\r\n5TH. Chapel.\r\n\r\n6TH. Steward's Apartments.\r\n\r\nWith a connected plan for the distribution of the ground on the\r\nnorthwest side of the continuation of Sherbrooke Street in avenues--with\r\nornamental and kitchen gardens.\r\n\r\nThe said plans to provide for the erection in the first instance of such\r\nportions of the building as are specified below to be hereafter\r\nincorporated with the general design when completed; the sum at present\r\ndisposable being limited to about £5000.\r\n\r\n1ST. Two large rooms, each calculated for separate\r\n       classes of 50 non-resident students.\r\n\r\n2ND. Two rooms available for medical students,\r\n       chemical apparatus, etc.\r\n\r\n3RD. College Hall.\r\n\r\n4TH. Library.\r\n\r\n5TH. Steward's Apartments.\r\n\r\nInformation respecting the proposed site and grounds, with other\r\nparticulars, can be obtained on application to the Rev. Dr. Bethune,\r\nPrincipal of McGill College, Montreal, to whom the plans are to be\r\ndelivered on or before the 1ST of October next.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM S. BURRAGE,\r\n    For the Rev. R. R. Burrage,\r\n   (Sec'y to the Board of R. I.)\r\n\r\nPlans were accordingly submitted by several architects, and were\r\nforwarded by the Board to the Governors of McGill for their comments.\r\nThe Governors pointed out that even in the best and most suitable plan\r\nsubmitted \"no provision was made for retiring rooms for Professors!\" The\r\nplans provided for a Post Office at the entrance to the grounds, a\r\nBotanical Lecture-house and \"ornamental bridges\" over the stream that\r\nran through the grounds near the present University Street. The Board of\r\nthe Royal Institution declined to accept any of the plans submitted on\r\nthe ground that they involved too great an expenditure, and building\r\noperations were again indefinitely delayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Plan of the Proposed University_]\r\n\r\nThe Governors continued to urge with vigour the immediate erection of a\r\nbuilding. They tried to force the Board, for no apparent legal reason,\r\nto have the building completed before the 29th of June, 1839, the tenth\r\nanniversary of the opening of the College, and in October, 1838, the\r\nPrincipal wrote to the Board: \"I am well informed that it is the\r\nintention of the heirs Desrivières, should not a College be erected on\r\nBurnside property within ten years from the period of possession thereof\r\nby the Royal Institution, to sue for the recovery of the whole bequest.\r\nNo legal advice has been taken on the subject, but we think it\r\nprudent to avoid the contest.\" The Board sought legal advice on the\r\nlatter question and were assured that there were no grounds whatsoever\r\nfor such an assumption on the part of the heirs, and that such a\r\ncontention could not be defended in law. No attempt indeed was made to\r\nput forward such a plea, and it is very doubtful if such an attempt was\r\never contemplated. But that the Board feared this possibility is evident\r\nfrom their determination speedily to establish the College on a more\r\nreal basis. They decided to begin instruction in Burnside House.\r\nDifficulties, however, were in the way. The Principal was occupying the\r\ndwelling house, and although he had taken possession of it without the\r\nBoard's approval they could not well compel him to leave. Moreover, he\r\nhad expended a considerable sum from his own private funds on repairs to\r\nthe estate. He had submitted a bill for the amount to the Board, but the\r\nBoard declined to pay it as they had not authorised the expenditure.\r\nThey contended, too, that he could reimburse himself from the products\r\nof the farm. The situation was a delicate one, and gradually the evils\r\nof a dual control were being disclosed. The Board knew that the\r\nPrincipal would not vacate the building in which they wished to begin\r\ninstruction until his bill was paid. On November 21st, 1838, they voted:\r\n\"that a communication be made to the Governors of McGill College that it\r\nis in the opinion of the Board expedient that a permanent Principal and\r\nProfessors be appointed and the actual working of the College commenced\r\nas speedily as possible in Burnside House till such time as more\r\nconvenient buildings be erected, by which means the wishes of the\r\nGovernors to have the College established and in operation before the\r\n29th of June next will be met, and that the Board will take into\r\nconsideration the claim of Dr. Bethune arising out of expenses incurred\r\nby him on the estate of Burnside while in his possession on his vacating\r\nthe premises and rendering an account.\" Meanwhile the Governors'\r\nmeetings had dwindled to two, and sometimes to one member. There was\r\ncriticism that their meetings were no longer representative, and to\r\nthese statements, because of their own objection to the alleged Downing\r\nStreet methods of the Royal Institution, the Governors were sensitive.\r\nTo meet this criticism they established the \"Corporation\" of the\r\nCollege, to include not only the Governors, but a number of the members\r\nof the teaching staff, and certain citizens selected because of their\r\ninterest in education. The first meeting of this body was held on\r\nNovember 27th, 1838. There were present Sir John Colborne, the\r\nGovernor-General; the Principal; Drs. Robertson, Stephenson and Holmes\r\nof the Medical School, and the Hon. George Moffat. It was at this\r\nmeeting that the resolution of the Board above referred to was\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was not received with applause nor with delighted\r\napproval. The Governors doubted the efficacy of the plan. The Principal\r\nwas not eager to vacate Burnside House. The Professors in the Medical\r\nSchool resented the suggestion that the \"actual working of the College\"\r\nhad yet to be commenced. In answer, it was resolved that \"in the opinion\r\nof Corporation it is expedient that a College be _built_ before the 29th\r\nof June next on the Burnside Estate as the surest means of securing the\r\nbequest of the late Mr. McGill.\" But the bequest had already been\r\nsecured; it had been paid over to the Royal Institution in December,\r\n1837! Notwithstanding the Board's decision, the Governors insisted on\r\nthe erection of a building before the 29th of the following June. The\r\namended Charter had not yet been approved. There was still provision\r\nonly for four professorships, and these had been filled by the members\r\nof the Medical School. Only one of them was now vacant. Until the\r\nCharter was approved, then, and provision made for the appointment of\r\nmore professors, the building erected could only be occupied mainly by\r\nMedical teachers. In December, 1838, the Royal Institution again\r\nrecorded their opposition to the Governors' desire for \"the hasty\r\nerection in a few weeks of a building adapted only for instruction in\r\nMedical Science.\" They expressed their belief \"that the first proper and\r\nmost pressing measure to be adopted in execution of the plain expression\r\nof the testator's will and of the Charter is to commence forthwith a\r\ncourse of general instruction in the ordinary branches of a learned\r\nCollegiate education in the buildings now erected on the Burnside\r\nEstate.\" They added that \"they see no difficulty in accomplishing this\r\nobject before it would be possible to commence the erection of a new\r\nbuilding, and they are of opinion that it would be a nearer approach to\r\na real performance of the testator's intentions than the attempt to run\r\nup a new building before the 29th of June, next, which even if it could\r\nbe finished by that time would not deserve the name of a University.\"\r\nThey did not consider that the terms \"erect\" and \"establish\" used in the\r\nwill \"could with any propriety be interpreted as meaning the erection\r\nof a material building.\" They declared that it was undoubtedly the\r\ntestator's intention to establish an institution for collegiate\r\neducation; they expressed their determination to apply the funds first\r\nof all to the payment of \"a Principal and of such Professors as may be\r\nrequired, and to proceed in due course with the erection of a more\r\nextensive building than even that suggested by the Governors.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Governors would not agree; they urged that a decision on the\r\nCharter be obtained at once. On February 5th, 1839, the Board again\r\nexpressed their views. They were sensible, they said, of the necessity\r\nfor the appointment of additional professors, but they emphasised the\r\nfolly of waiting for this permission before erecting a College building.\r\nApproval of the amended Charter might be postponed indefinitely, and the\r\npresent Charter provided for a building for collegiate education. They\r\nadded: \"The Board are not aware of the circumstances under which the\r\n_Medical Faculty of Montreal_ became possessed of all the Professorships\r\nof the College but they must suppose that it could only have been a\r\ntemporary arrangement, without remuneration, adopted with such\r\nprecautions as not to allow the present holders of Professorships\r\nsetting up the pretension to continue to fill them to the exclusion of\r\nother branches of knowledge. The existing arrangement appears to the\r\nBoard to be clearly liable to the objection that it is contrary to the\r\nterms of the Charter and the intention of the founder since an\r\ninstitution of which the offices are so filled for the purpose of one\r\nscience alone cannot in law or in common parlance be considered as a\r\nUniversity where all the branches of literature are or may be\r\nuniversally taught, and such an Institution is erected by the Charter\r\naccording to the express will of the testator.\"\r\n\r\nTheir plan was to appoint a permanent Principal who should be required\r\nto lecture in some branch or branches of knowledge, and to establish\r\ntemporary Lectureships which could be changed to Professorships when the\r\namended Charter, permitting an increase in the number of Professorships,\r\nwas approved. Under this plan they saw \"an easy means of opening at once\r\na course of public instruction which would meet the present wants of the\r\nProvince and be capable of future extension.\" They would devote the\r\nendowment fund, they said, to the payment of Professors' salaries. The\r\nhouse on the Burnside Estate was sufficient, they thought, \"for the\r\nlimited purpose at present contemplated,\" and \"in that building, if\r\nnowhere else, a College should be put in actual operation,\" for by so\r\ndoing \"an effective answer would be afforded to any demand or pretension\r\nthat might be raised to obtain the forfeiture of the property bequeathed\r\non the pretence of the College not being in operation.\" They promised to\r\nproceed to the erection of a building \"with all despatch consistent with\r\ndue caution. But at least a year from next summer must elapse before a\r\nbuilding suitable to the purpose of a University can be prepared for\r\noccupation.\" They therefore urged the use of Burnside House for the\r\npresent, at least.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this letter the Medical Professors contended through the\r\nPrincipal, that their appointment was not a temporary arrangement and\r\nthat it was not their intention to resign their commissions. The\r\nGovernors stated further, that they could not feel themselves justified\r\nin pressing for the resignation of any of these Professors, who were\r\nreceiving no salary, but who \"now had a near prospect of reaping some\r\nadvantage from their appointment.\" They condemned the Board for\r\nunnecessary delay in erecting a building in which to hold classes and\r\ntheir letters did not add to the harmony so desirable in that critical\r\nperiod. The Principal and Governors did not approve of using Burnside\r\nHouse for lecture rooms, because, in their opinion, it was unfit for\r\nsuch a purpose \"except on such a scale as would entitle it only to the\r\nname of a Grammar School; because they believed a suitable building\r\ncould be erected within a year; because it was intended to be the\r\nresidence of the Principal; and because they could not see that any\r\nobject would be attained by such a temporary, insufficient and\r\nunsatisfactory arrangement.\" They stated further, with some suggestion\r\nof defiance, that they would be prepared to open the College with\r\nsuitable teachers as soon as the necessary building or buildings were\r\nerected \"on the most extensive scale and in the most efficient manner\r\nwhich the funds that may be at their disposal will admit of, and that\r\nuntil such a building was provided no instruction would be given.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution seems to have desired harmony and to have been\r\nwilling to meet the wishes of the Governors at least half-way. At a\r\nmeeting of the Board on February 20th, 1839, it was decided to call\r\nagain for plans to be submitted before the 10th of May following. It was\r\nresolved at this meeting \"that the accommodation of the Medical Faculty\r\nbe limited to two rooms for class rooms, these to form part of the\r\ngeneral building unless separate accommodation in detached buildings\r\ncould be obtained for them within the limits of the £5,000 allotted for\r\nthe whole edifice, and without interfering with or embarrassing the\r\ngeneral plan; and that if the Medical Faculty required other or larger\r\naccommodation than was consistent with these conditions they must be\r\nleft to their own resources to obtain it, the Board, however, being\r\nwilling to allow them to build on some part of the grounds of Burnside\r\nif they found funds for doing so.\" They had meanwhile petitioned the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Sir John Colborne, and Council, for a Provincial\r\ngrant to aid in the construction of the building, but their appeal had\r\nno success.\r\n\r\nThe Governors of the College then decided to agree to the erection of a\r\nsmaller building than that at first requested. The Medical School, too,\r\nfor various reasons concluded that they did not desire accommodation in\r\nthe new building. The Governors wrote to the Board stating that they\r\nwould be satisfied with the erection of a building for 60 students,\r\nwithout sitting rooms; necessary class rooms; College Hall; Library;\r\nSteward's Apartments and accommodation for the Principal and two\r\nProfessors--which could be built for £6,000. They pointed out that in\r\nthis estimate there was no provision whatever for the Medical Department\r\n\"nor perhaps will such provision be at all necessary. The present\r\nMedical Professors are now of opinion that the situation of Burnside is\r\ntoo remote from the centre of the population for this department,\r\nbecause, besides the inconvenience to the Professors themselves, the\r\nattendance there of Medical Students who will be generally resident in\r\nthe Town at 4 or 5 different Lectures daily will be attended with very\r\nserious inconvenience if not insuperable difficulty. They would\r\ntherefore much prefer that a sufficient allowance should be made for\r\nrenting a building in Town for the Medical Department. To meet their\r\nviews in this respect the House on Burnside (which will not be required\r\nfor the residence of the Principal if accommodation be provided for him\r\nwithin the walls of the College), together with that portion of the\r\npremises on the southeast side of Sherbrooke Street, might be let for a\r\nsum fully adequate to the expense of renting sufficient accommodation\r\nfor the Medical Department in Town.\"\r\n\r\nTo this latter suggestion the Board agreed. They were still determined\r\nthat pending the completion of the proposed building, Collegiate\r\nteaching should be undertaken at once in Burnside House. But it was\r\nfirst necessary that the Principal give up the house. A dispute then\r\narose between the Board and the Governors with reference to the\r\nresponsibility for the repairs to the estate. More money had been\r\nexpended than the Board had authorised. The Board contended that the\r\nPrincipal should make an allowance for rent of the house, which he had\r\noccupied for nearly two years, and they refused to pay the account\r\nsubmitted for the expenses incurred. The Governors declined to admit the\r\njustice of this claim. The Principal had already written to the Board in\r\nJanuary, 1839, stating that he would \"keep possession of Burnside until\r\nhis full account was paid, and that he would vacate the premises when\r\nrequired to do so by the Governors.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board then agreed to pay to the Principal the whole amount claimed\r\nby him, \"however liable to objection, with whatever deduction for rent\r\nhe himself should agree to,\" if he would consent to vacate Burnside\r\nHouse. The Principal, in a somewhat scornful reply, declined for two\r\nreasons, first that this proposal implied the necessity of bribing him\r\nto vacate the premises; and second that by accepting it, he might be\r\nconsidered as selling for the settlement of his account the possession\r\nwhich the Governors held of the premises by reason of his occupancy. But\r\nhe again stated that he would vacate the premises when ordered to do so\r\nby the Governors. The result was a protracted and bitter discussion\r\nbetween the two bodies, with many recriminations on both sides and more\r\nfrankness than tact. The Lord Bishop of Montreal, the Rev. Dr. G. J.\r\nMountain, who was Principal of the Royal Institution and formerly\r\nPrincipal of McGill, naturally interested himself personally in the\r\ndiscussion. On February 25th, 1839, he wrote to the Principal, saying,\r\n\"I will tell you unreservedly what I think, which is that ... you are\r\napt to give colour to the transactions in which you are engaged.... I\r\nsay this without reserve because if you will receive it in good part I\r\nthink it may be of use to you and save upon occasion hard constructions\r\nbeing put upon your proceedings.... It is very unwillingly indeed that\r\nas Principal of the Board, I have been drawn into any sort of collision\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Principal promptly replied, accusing the Board of gross\r\nneglect and unnecessary delay. \"Indeed,\" he said, \"their zeal for the\r\ninterests of the College has for some time past chiefly manifested\r\nitself in their efforts and schemes for dislodging me from Burnside and\r\nin their proceedings they seem to have adopted the favourite peroration\r\nof Cicero which may be freely translated thus, 'and Bethune must be\r\nousted.'\" He added: \"I can afford to forgive the Board for any hard\r\nconstructions they put upon my proceedings; they may be necessary for\r\ntheir own justification.\" To this Bishop Mountain replied: \"I have had\r\nquite enough of this painful collision.\"\r\n\r\nThe Principal declared his intention of remaining in possession of\r\nBurnside House, and he wrote to the Board that \"no precise period is\r\nfixed for my vacating the premises.\" The Board contended that they\r\n\"desired an amicable adjustment of such differences as had unfortunately\r\nexisted\"; but for several years no adjustment was made. It is\r\nunnecessary to enter here into the details of the subsequent dispute\r\nbetween the Board and the Principal and Governors over the occupancy of\r\nBurnside House. It was but one of many unfortunate disagreements in\r\nwhich each side contended for what they believed to be just. The\r\nPrincipal's account for repairs to the property was in the end paid and\r\nin November, 1839, he vacated Burnside House. But the controversy\r\nbetween the two bodies did not then end.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1839, the Governors decided to ignore the Board and to\r\nseek direct aid from the Provincial Government. They asked for a grant\r\nof £5,000 for building purposes and £5,000 for the purchase of\r\nphilosophical apparatus, furniture and books for a Library. They\r\nincluded also £100 a year for a Professor of Classical Literature and\r\n£100 a year for a Professor of Mathematics; £50 each for two Divinity\r\nLecturers, one of the Anglican Church and one of the Church of Scotland;\r\n£50 each for three Medical Professors; and £50 for a Professor of Law\r\n\"much wanted.\" They expressed their desire, if the building fund was\r\ngranted, to rent Burnside House and with the proceeds therefrom to pay\r\nfor a building in town for the Medical School. \"The Medical Faculty,\"\r\nthey said, \"could then go into immediate operation, and all the other\r\nProfessors, with the exception of the Principal, could also commence\r\ninstruction at their respective residences.\" Apparently it was their\r\nopinion that the Medical School had not yet begun to operate as an\r\nintegral part of the University. For obvious reasons the above appeal\r\nfailed. The Government declined to interfere. The grant was not made and\r\nthe Governors of the College turned again with reluctance to the Royal\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nThere was likewise further difficulty in connection with the amended\r\nCharter, which the Home authorities had not yet ratified. The Board of\r\nthe Royal Institution had been asked by the Governor-General for their\r\ndetailed opinions and suggestions on necessary amendments. The Board was\r\nslow to answer. The delay was preventing the appointment of Professors\r\nand the growth of the College. The hands of the Governors were tied. On\r\nAugust 11, 1839, the Principal wrote to Sir John Colborne, the\r\nGovernor-General, protesting against the continued failure to decide the\r\nissue. \"When I agreed to the appointment of another Principal in my\r\nroom,\" he said, \"it was in the confident expectation that the amended\r\nCharter would have been in our possession before this period. By that\r\nCharter I should retain my office of Governor of the College even if\r\nvacated by my resignation of the Office of Principal, but as obstacles\r\nare thrown in the way of a speedy accomplishment of the wishes of the\r\nGovernors in respect of the amended Charter, I feel myself constrained\r\nto retain the office of Principal until the Charter shall have been\r\nprocured.\" He also objected on behalf of the Governors to the\r\nappointment of any Professors and to the opening of the College, except\r\nthe Medical Department, until approval was given to the Charter.\r\nPossibly the fact that the amended Charter permitted the\r\nacting-Principal, after his retirement, still to be a Governor of the\r\nCollege as Rector of Christ Church, Montreal, influenced the Board in\r\ntheir disapproval of it. For the quarrel was not always above personal\r\nprejudices, to which the advancement of the College was often\r\nunfortunately sacrificed.\r\n\r\nOn August 17th, 1839, the Board at last broke their silence, and in a\r\nletter to Sir John Colborne they gave utterance to their reasons for\r\nopposition. They blamed the Governors for not having first submitted the\r\nCharter to them before sending it to the Colonial Office,--and in this\r\nthey were well within their rights. They had not, they said, even seen a\r\ncertified copy of the document. They now agreed, however, that the\r\nexisting Charter required alteration. They suggested that all the\r\nGovernors of the College should be residents of the Province, but they\r\nobjected to giving the Governors power to fill vacancies as they\r\noccurred, as this would lead in the end to a clique or cabal rule which\r\nwould lead to abuses in the management of the Institution. The number of\r\nProfessorships should, they thought, be left unlimited, at the joint\r\ndiscretion of the Governors and the Board. The Governors were to be\r\nsubservient in power to the Board, and all appointments were to be\r\nratified by the Crown. There should also be permission given for the\r\ngranting of Honorary degrees. The Visitatorial duties and powers of the\r\nRoyal Institution should be more clearly defined. \"The Board,\" the\r\nletter stated, \"also think it important, seeing that the declared object\r\nof the Royal Charter was the promotion of true religion, that the body\r\nof the Governors should be Protestants, and they beg leave also to call\r\nthe particular attention of your Excellency to the necessity of\r\nintroducing some provision into the amended Charter for requiring not\r\nonly the Principal, Vice-Principal and Professors, and all others\r\nengaged in the instruction of youth in the University, but also the\r\nGovernors themselves before being admitted to office, to make and\r\nsubscribe a declaration of their belief in the Holy Scriptures as the\r\nWord of God, and in the doctrine of the Trinity of persons in the\r\nGodhead, as held by orthodox Protestant Churches.\"\r\n\r\nTo the majority of these suggestions the Governors agreed. But they\r\ndenied the right of the members of the Board to exercise so great a\r\npower as such suggestions, if carried out, would give them. They\r\nprotested against the necessity of having appointments ratified by the\r\nCrown. There was a rapid cross-fire of correspondence to the\r\nGovernor-General, in which the various suggestions were presented and\r\nanswered by each of the contending parties. But into the details of this\r\nlong-continued and at times bitter correspondence it is unnecessary here\r\nfurther to enter. Meanwhile the Charter waited.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1839, the Medical School was in need of funds. They\r\nappealed to the Governors. The Governors had no money, but they voted\r\n£500, and on September 19th, they applied to the Royal Institution for a\r\ngrant of that amount \"in order to enable them to commence a course of\r\nMedical Instruction.\" The Board refused in the following letter\r\nforwarded on October 12th: \"The Board resolve with regret that they\r\ncannot give sanction to this vote of the Governors, as they conceive\r\nthemselves bound in the first instance to apply the means at their\r\ndisposal for purposes of general instruction, and those means are so\r\nlimited as to render it impossible to grant the sum demanded by the\r\nMedical Faculty without sacrificing general to one branch of\r\nprofessional education.... The Board are, however, fully aware of the\r\nadvantages to McGill College and to the public generally which the\r\nproposed course of Medical lectures cannot fail to be attended with.\"\r\nThey hoped at a later date \"to be able to entertain the application,\" if\r\nthe appeal for funds recently made to the Government should succeed.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Bethune desired to procure a legal decision before a competent\r\ntribunal on the Board's refusal to make the above grant. The Governor of\r\nthe Province was appealed to, but as he was about to leave Canada at the\r\nend of his term of office he again declined to interfere. He felt, too,\r\nwith reference to a Provincial grant that he was only authorised to\r\nissue from the funds of the Province such a sum as was absolutely\r\nnecessary to carry on educational work until a meeting of the Special\r\nCouncil could make provision for such an object and also for the voting\r\nof \"a sum of money towards the erecting of McGill College.\" The\r\ndiscussion was finally closed by a resolution of the Board on the 4th\r\nof April, 1840, in which they said that in addition to having voted\r\n£8,000 for the erection of a building they had provided for the\r\nestablishment of three Professorships with £300 a year for each chair,\r\nand an additional £100 for the Principal. \"In these arrangements,\" they\r\npointed out, \"the Board did not lose sight of the necessity of\r\nsubsequently providing for the instruction of students in the Medical\r\nand Legal professions, but they were clearly of opinion that in the\r\nactual state of the funds, these objects, however desirable, must be\r\npostponed for the opening of the Institution in the other branches of\r\ngeneral education. To these arrangements the Governors offered no\r\nmaterial objection and it was obvious that the resources at the disposal\r\nof the Board did not warrant any material increase of expenditure.\" With\r\nreference to the requested grant for the Medical School, they expressed\r\nsurprise that such a demand should be made on their scanty and already\r\ninadequate resources, and they declared that they \"would not be\r\njustified in the administration of their trust, in suffering their\r\nresources to be diminished for any object however desirable or important\r\nbut that which they conscientiously judged the most desirable and\r\nimportant and primarily contemplated in the will of Mr. McGill,--which\r\nwas the providing of collegiate education.\" There the discussion ended.\r\nThe Medical School continued to be regarded as an independent\r\ninstitution, under the protection of the McGill authorities for the\r\npurpose merely of legalising their degrees. The Board had won in their\r\ncontention, and the question was temporarily dropped.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, during the brief armistice between the Governors and\r\nthe Royal Institution, plans for the College building had been agreed\r\nupon and the contract had been let. The original plans had been greatly\r\nmodified so that the expenditure might be in keeping with the funds\r\navailable. But even with many changes the first estimate of £5,000 was\r\nsoon found to have increased in fact to between £10,000 and £12,000. One\r\nof the original plans herewith reproduced, and typical of all the plans\r\nsubmitted, called for a large building in the form of the letter H. The\r\ntwo main wings looked east and west, instead of north and south as at\r\npresent, and between them was a connecting structure. Rooms were\r\nprovided for 100 students. The Medical building was to be separate. The\r\nCollege building was to have a Chapel, but it was also to have a large\r\n\"cellar for beer and wine.\" Certain sections attached to the building\r\nwere distinctly classified and designated \"for Professors,\" \"for McGill\r\nstudents,\" and \"for servants and Medical students.\" It was found that\r\nsuch a building would entail too great an expense, and the plans were\r\nchanged to provide two buildings, the present Central Arts Building and\r\nthe present East Wing, or Administration Offices. The latter was\r\nintended to contain the Principal's apartments and rooms for Professors,\r\nand there the Principal subsequently dwelt for several years. Between\r\nthe two buildings provision was made for a covered passage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Original in McGill Library Photo Rice Studios\r\n_The Proposed McGill College Original Building_]\r\n\r\nIt was soon apparent that the cost of the new buildings would be greater\r\nthan estimated. Before June, 1840, a sum of £2,783 had been expended and\r\nprovision had to be made for the payment of a further sum of £5,000 in\r\nthe following January. In order to secure this amount it was decided\r\nto advertise for sale certain lots adjoining the College site on\r\nBurnside Estate, and to procure plans for the laying out in building\r\nlots of all the land not in use. This was the beginning of the disposal\r\nof the unused part of the estate, a sacrifice which relieved the College\r\nfrom temporary financial embarrassment but which in later years, when\r\nreal-estate increased in value, greatly depleted its revenue. The funds\r\nat this time were so low that the Governors could not pay a watchman or\r\ncaretaker and the Board wrote to the Governors in October, 1840, asking,\r\n\"Is any suitable person known to you who would consent to have charge of\r\nthem [the buildings under construction] without remuneration, on\r\ncondition of the requisite fuel being provided?\" The gross annual\r\nrevenue from the McGill properties vested in the Board for the support\r\nof the College was only £559. 6. 8. The Board again appealed to the\r\nGovernment for a grant of £5,000 to finish the building, also for \"a\r\nvery moderate sum to purchase the large collection of books formerly\r\nbelonging to the late Mr. Fleming, the greater part of which would form\r\na suitable foundation for a Library.\" This appeal was again\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1841, amidst many discouragements and financial\r\nworries, the erection of the buildings went forward. On October 21st,\r\n1841, the Principal, who was one of the building committee, notified the\r\nBoard that they were nearly ready for the reception of pupils. But their\r\ncompletion was for various reasons delayed several months. The Governors\r\nthen decided to apply to the Legislature for a grant of £1,500 a year\r\nfor current expenses and £5,000 for Philosophical Apparatus, the\r\nrudiments of a Library, and furniture; to ask also for the passing of an\r\nact repealing the Act of 1801, and vesting the McGill bequest in the\r\nGovernors of the College; and to request that the Chief Justice and the\r\nPrincipal be authorised to communicate with the Royal Institution and to\r\ntake steps to carry out this resolution. This application was again\r\nwithout avail, and the submitting of it was obviously not conducive to\r\nharmony and peace.\r\n\r\nArrangements were now completed for the sale of lots from the Burnside\r\nEstate. In all 25½ acres were offered in small sections \"as soon as\r\nMr. Phillips' consent could be obtained to give one-half of the ground\r\nrequired for a proposed street,\" and negotiations were entered into for\r\nthe leasing of any of the land left unsold. The Governors demanded that\r\nthe Royal Institution should transfer to them the entire property, but\r\nthe Board refused, claiming that they were prohibited from so doing by\r\nthe terms of the will.\r\n\r\nThe Governors then devised an ingenious scheme to secure possession of\r\nthe premises. The Principal proposed to the Board in May, 1842, that\r\nthey lease the estate to the Governors for a period of 99 years. This\r\nthe Board refused to do. They had obviously no desire to allow the\r\nGovernors to get control. An endeavour to secure a lease was then made\r\nby a Mr. Pelton, and his application was recommended by the Principal.\r\nThe Board replied that there were legal and insuperable objections to\r\nthe granting of such a request and that they had no power under the law\r\nto give a lease for a longer period than 21 years. They agreed to give\r\nPelton a lease for that period, and they guaranteed \"that the same\r\nshall be renewed for each subsequent term until the whole period of 99\r\nyears shall be accomplished.\" The lease seems to have been actually\r\nentered into, but because of difficulty over the security offered,\r\ncombined with legal obstacles, it was cancelled soon afterwards. It\r\ntranspired later that Pelton was merely the agent of the Governors and\r\nthat in order to secure possession of the property, they had engaged him\r\nto act on their behalf, on the understanding that he was to transfer the\r\nlease to them when he received it.\r\n\r\nOf the Governors' connection with this plan the Board was obviously not\r\naware at the time. The details were frankly and clearly outlined in an\r\ninteresting letter written by acting-Principal Bethune to the Hon. R. A.\r\nTucker, Principal of the Royal Institution, on November 4th, 1845, when\r\nPelton tried without success to establish a claim to some of the\r\nproperty. Extracts from this letter give further indication of the\r\nbitterness and hopelessness of the controversy:\r\n\r\n\"After the sale of the 99 years' lease had been advertised, it occurred\r\nto me that a good opportunity was thereby afforded to the Governors of\r\nthe College for getting the management of the property into their own\r\nhands, by purchasing the lease. I need hardly say that the difficulties\r\nwhich had occurred between the late Board of the Royal Institution and\r\nthe Governors of the College with regard to the right of possession\r\nnaturally led to such a desire. Being the only Governor then resident in\r\nMontreal, and His Excellency, the late Sir Charles Bagot, having left\r\nthe management with reference to that sale to me, I took upon myself the\r\nresponsibility of making the purchase for the Governors;--but I felt\r\nconvinced that if I did so in my own name, the Board of the Royal\r\nInstitution would throw difficulties in the way. I therefore employed\r\nMr. Pelton to purchase the property for me, and he did so on the perfect\r\nunderstanding that the property should, in the first instance, be\r\nconveyed to him, and afterwards by him to me, as he supposed, but really\r\nto 'the Governors, Principal and Fellows of McGill College.' In that\r\ntransaction therefore Mr. Pelton acted as my agent; and continued to do\r\nso, placing only such tenants on Burnside as were approved by me, and\r\ncollecting the rents for and paying them to me until the 1st May, 1844,\r\nafter which he refused to continue to pay them to me. Immediately after\r\nthe adjudication of the property, a correspondence took place with the\r\nRoyal Institution about security for the payment of the rents, before it\r\nwas discovered that a 99 years' lease could not be granted, and Mr.\r\nPelton took upon himself without consulting me to offer security, which\r\nhe said was accepted by the Board; and then, knowing that I had not\r\noffered any security, proposed to me to let him be the _bona fide_\r\npurchaser; but I refused, saying that I supposed the same person who was\r\nwilling to be security for him would also be security for me. It was\r\nimmediately after this discovered that the Royal Institution could not\r\ngrant a lease for a longer period than 21 years, and the whole affair\r\nwas considered by me as at an end, that is, that it was no sale, because\r\nthe Royal Institution could not be expected to do that which they had no\r\nlegal authority to do....\" The lease was subsequently cancelled, and it\r\nwas shown that Pelton had no legal claim upon the property.\r\n\r\nWhen the College buildings were nearing completion, towards the end of\r\n1842, the Board prepared the necessary documents for the transfer of the\r\nBurnside Estate to the possession of the Governors of the College. But\r\nthey took care to safeguard their own powers. They retained the right to\r\ninquire from time to time into the management and administration of the\r\nUniversity, to remove officers of the College for misconduct, to examine\r\ninto the compliance of the Governors with the Charter, and to establish\r\nstatutes and by-laws for the government of the College. In short, the\r\nGovernors, although they were at last to obtain possession of the\r\nproperty, were still to be subservient to the Board.\r\n\r\nThis was naturally not satisfactory to the Governors. In accordance with\r\nthe resolution passed on August 8th, 1842, they drew up a bill the\r\nobject of which was \"to abolish the Royal Institution, and to provide\r\nfor the better government of McGill College.\" It stipulated that all the\r\nmonies, goods and chattels of which the Royal Institution was possessed\r\nunder the will of James McGill should be vested in the Government of the\r\nUniversity. The Principal went to Kingston to endeavour to have the bill\r\npassed during the following session of Parliament but the abrupt ending\r\nof the session prevented even its introduction. He went to Kingston\r\nagain in 1843, but he was frustrated by a similar cause. Against the\r\nbill the Board emphatically protested. They declared it to be an attempt\r\nto overthrow the plainly expressed intentions and directions of the\r\ntestator, and an action \"as unexampled in the history of British\r\nlegislation as it is contrary to the first principles of law, justice\r\nand reason.\" They stated further that \"they have executed the\r\nintentions of the testator diligently, faithfully and efficiently, so\r\nfar as they have not been obstructed in doing so by the acts of those\r\nwhose duty it was to have facilitated their proceedings.\" The bill was\r\nnot passed. It helped only to shatter whatever hopes may have existed\r\nfor the ending of the quarrel between the Governors and the Board as\r\nthen constituted. It made it plain that there was now no possibility of\r\nan amicable agreement.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1843, the buildings were completed as far as the funds\r\navailable would permit. Because of lack of money, the Board did not feel\r\njustified in making any outlay on the College grounds. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, they had increased the value of the estate by giving to the\r\nCity of Montreal the continuation lines of Dorchester and St. Catherine\r\nStreets on condition that the additional fences required on opening\r\nthese streets should be erected at the expense of the city.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1843, it was decided to open the buildings for the reception of\r\nstudents in the first week of the following September. To this the Board\r\nand the Governors, strangely enough, agreed, but the agreement was only\r\nmomentary. The Board asked the Governors for an estimate of the amount\r\nrequired for furniture for the buildings. The Governors refused to make\r\nan estimate. They were unable, they said, to do so; they desired a\r\ncovering grant of £500 to buy what they needed. The Board suggested with\r\nsome touch of sarcasm that they should get \"a carpenter or a tradesman\"\r\nto make an estimate if they could not make it themselves, but the\r\nGovernors again declined. The Board contended that they could not make\r\na grant unless they previously knew precisely the details of the\r\nproposed expenditure; and the Governors answered that they would borrow\r\n£500 if the Royal Institution would not give it to them. The Board then\r\nasked for an accounting of the money \"already received and expended by\r\nthe Principal in connection with the rents and products of the Burnside\r\nEstate.\" The Secretary was instructed to reply that no account would be\r\nsubmitted as the Governors felt that any money so received was but a\r\nvery small remuneration for services rendered by the Principal. To this\r\nthe Board rejoined with bitterness that the Principal had not been\r\nregularly appointed, that he had done no duty as Professor, that they\r\nhad never authorised his taking possession of Burnside and that the\r\nproducts from the farm should provide for him more than a sufficient\r\nremuneration; they were determined, they said, to pay no salaries unless\r\naccounts were rendered to them and approved. Such, at this critical\r\nperiod, was the co-operation arising from a dual control!\r\n\r\nOn June 21st, the opening of the College in the autumn was approved by\r\nthe Governor General. The Rev. F. J. Lundy (a graduate of Oxford) had\r\nbeen appointed Professor of Classical Literature in November, 1842. He\r\nhad received, with the Principal, one of the first D.C.L. degrees\r\nconferred by McGill in the spring of 1843. In addition to his duties as\r\nProfessor he was now appointed Secretary of the College, and was later\r\nmade Vice-Principal. His appointment to the Faculty of Arts was not\r\nratified at once by the Board of the Royal Institution, and they\r\nintimated that they would not pay his salary. The Governors voted £300 a\r\nyear and fuel for a Professor of Mathematics. As a result of the\r\nBoard's contention that the Principal had not been regularly appointed,\r\na commission or warrant of appointment was issued by the Governors on\r\nJuly 12th, and on the following day the Principal was appointed to be\r\nalso Professor of Divinity, at a salary of £250, \"as soon as funds\r\nderived from the property shall admit of it.\" A Bursar, Secretary and\r\nRegistrar was appointed at a salary of £100 a year and fees, to be later\r\nsanctioned, and a Beadle was selected at £30 a year and fees and board.\r\n\r\nA Code of Statutes, Rules and Regulations for the government of the\r\nCollege was now prepared by the Governors. Without the approval of the\r\nBoard it was forwarded to the Governor-General for submission to the\r\nCrown for ratification. Six years passed before these Statutes, with\r\nslight alterations, received Royal sanction, with the result that the\r\nCollege opened without definite rules for its guidance. The reasons for\r\nthis delay will be outlined elsewhere. It is only necessary to mention\r\nhere that the first difficulty in connection with the Statutes arose\r\nfrom requirements connected with religious instruction in the\r\nUniversity. Two of these, which were later disallowed by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, provided first, that \"no Professor, Lecturer or Tutor shall\r\nteach in the College any principles contrary to the doctrines of the\r\nUnited Church of England and Ireland,\" and second, that \"on every Sunday\r\nduring the term, all the resident members of the University under the\r\ndegree of B.C.L. who have not obtained a dispensation to the contrary,\r\nshall attend the morning service in the Protestant Episcopal Parish\r\nChurch of Montreal.\" It was also stipulated that \"the prayers in the\r\nCollege Chapel shall be said in rotation by such officers of the College\r\nas shall be in Holy Orders of the United Church of England and Ireland.\"\r\nThese provisions, together with the fact that the acting-Principal, who\r\nwas also Rector of Christ Church, had just been appointed Professor of\r\nDivinity, gave rise to critical discussion, and made Lord Metcalfe, the\r\nGovernor-General, pause before advising the Colonial Office to obtain\r\nthe Royal ratification of the Statutes. He wrote to Lord Stanley, \"The\r\nmain point involved in these questions is whether the Religious\r\nInstruction to be given at McGill College shall be exclusively that of\r\nthe Church of England....\r\n\r\n\"The grounds on which the Governors have adopted the affirmative of the\r\nproposition, and appointed a Divinity Professor of the Church of\r\nEngland, are ably stated in their letter to me. On the other hand, there\r\nare strenuous remonstrances against this arrangement on the part of the\r\nMinisters of the other Protestant persuasions in the Province, and a\r\nstrong feeling against it in the community; and the design manifested to\r\nconnect the Institution, in that respect, exclusively with the Church of\r\nEngland will most probably deprive it of that support from the\r\nProvincial Legislature without which it will necessarily be crippled.\r\nThe opinions on this subject, understood to be prevalent in the\r\nProvince, are likely to lead to discussions in the Legislature; and it\r\nmay become necessary to modify the Institution so as to make it more\r\nsuitable to public expectation and general utility. If, therefore, it\r\nrested with me to determine on this reference, I should be disposed,\r\neither to disallow the Professorship of Divinity, or to suspend the\r\ndecision until it could be seen that the Institution can stand on the\r\nfooting on which the Governors have placed it.\r\n\r\n\"I am, by the Charter, a Governor of the Institution, but have not acted\r\nin that capacity; at first, simply because more urgent business\r\nprevented my going to Montreal to take a part in the proceedings of the\r\nGovernors; but subsequently, on reflection, for the following\r\nreasons:--I doubt the expediency of the Governor-General's taking a part\r\nas one of the Governors of an Institution in which he may be overruled\r\nby a majority, and apparently sanction measures which he disapproves.\r\nThe perusal of the correspondence between the Governors of the College\r\nand the Royal Institution of Quebec satisfied me that I ought not to\r\nplace myself in a position which would render me liable to become a\r\nparty concerned in such a correspondence, and subject to the assumed\r\nauthority and control of another Institution. The Income of the\r\nInstitution having become a bone of contention between the Church of\r\nEngland and the other Protestant Churches, it appears to me to be right\r\nthat I should perform my part as Governor-General without being\r\nembarrassed by proceedings to which I might be a party as a Governor of\r\nthe College.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of the Governor-General was approved by Lord Stanley and\r\nconsideration of the Statutes was consequently postponed.\r\n\r\nIn shaping the policy of the University the place of religious\r\ninstruction and theological training received earnest consideration. On\r\nthe necessity of including it in the College curriculum the Governors of\r\nthe College and the Board of the Royal Institution agreed, but they\r\ndiffered on the nature of the instruction and on the theological creed\r\nwhich should dominate or dictate such teaching. It was recognised as a\r\nvexed question. The Governors attempted to explain and justify their\r\nattitude of alleged religious \"exclusiveness\" referred to above in Lord\r\nMetcalfe's despatch, and to give reasons for the Statutes already\r\nmentioned. The following extracts from a long and somewhat laboured\r\nletter forwarded by the Governors to Lord Metcalfe on July 15, 1843, are\r\nof interest. The arguments advanced in the letter and the frequent\r\n\"begging of the question\" need no comment. The Governors still pleaded\r\nfor a Provincial grant, but they wished part, at least, of that public\r\ngrant devoted to one exclusive form of theological teaching, and they\r\nwere not averse to giving to the entire University a distinctively\r\nsectarian character.\r\n\r\n\"Another reason which compels us,\" they said, \"to commence on a scale so\r\nlimited, is the scantiness of our means. At present, the resources of\r\nthe College, arising from the property bequeathed by the founder, supply\r\nonly an annual income of £560 Provincial currency, and that not clear of\r\ndeductions. The Legislature has occasionally appropriated £500 annually,\r\nin aid of these funds, and though we trust there can be no danger of\r\nthis assistance being withdrawn, after the College shall have begun to\r\nbe more extensively useful to the Province, yet, it is incumbent on us,\r\nto consider that even this small aid is not permanently assured to the\r\nUniversity, and that to enable us to go beyond what we have now\r\nproposed, it will be necessary that the funds should be very\r\nconsiderably increased.... To meet the exigency of the present moment,\r\nwe earnestly hope that the liberal suggestion, in which the late\r\nGovernor-General concurred, will be acted upon with effect by Your\r\nExcellency and the Legislature, and with as little delay as may be\r\nconsistent with the unspeakable importance of the object to be obtained.\r\nIn Lower Canada, which is supposed to contain a population of not less\r\nthan 800,000 souls, there is at present (except in regard to the Medical\r\nFaculty) no seat of Learning, either Catholic or Protestant, in which a\r\nDegree can be conferred in any Art or Science. This is a defect which,\r\nwe believe, has not existed since the era of civilisation among so large\r\na community of British subjects, and we very anxiously hope that from\r\nthis moment no time may be lost in establishing McGill College upon such\r\na footing as may command the confidence of the country, and enable the\r\nInstitution, though indeed too tardily, to answer the purposes\r\ncontemplated by its munificent founder.... There is one point (and it is\r\nthe last) upon which, from the interest naturally and properly attached\r\nto it, we are aware much discussion may arise, and upon which, from its\r\nparamount importance, we desire, above all things, to be open and\r\nexplicit.\r\n\r\n\"It will be found, on examination of the Statutes now submitted, that no\r\ntest of a religious character is requisite, either from the Teachers or\r\nScholars. Persons of any religious creed may, therefore, dispense\r\ninstruction or receive it, except as regards religion itself, the\r\nCollege being equally open to all. But it will be found also that it is\r\nproposed to be distinctly made a Statute of the College, that no\r\nProfessor, Lecturer or Tutor shall teach within it any principles\r\ncontrary to the doctrines of the United Church of England and Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"We have not been able to bring ourselves to take part in the\r\nestablishment of an Institution for the education of youth without\r\nmaking provisions for their Religious Instruction, and for inculcating\r\nas a duty the worship of their Creator. We have therefore made certain\r\nStatutes respecting the performance of, and attendance at, Divine\r\nService, and we have established, so far as our power extends, a\r\nProfessorship of Divinity in our College.\r\n\r\n\"Taking these provisions in connection with the Statutes which enjoins\r\nthat nothing contrary to the doctrines of the United Church of England\r\nand Ireland shall be taught within the College, it follows obviously\r\n(and this we wish to be plainly understood) that the Divine Service to\r\nbe performed, and the Professorship of Divinity to be established, will\r\nbe of the Church of England, and of no other. But we have been careful\r\nat the same time to exempt from any necessity of attending Divine\r\nService, or of being present at the Lectures on Divinity, all such\r\nScholars, being members of other Religious Communities, as may desire a\r\ndispensation.\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the diversity of opinions entertained respecting the footing on\r\nwhich religious instruction should be placed in Seats of Learning, and\r\nhow futile have been the efforts made to reconcile them, we came to the\r\nconsideration of this subject with a dire sense of its difficulty, and\r\nwith much anxiety that we should ourselves arrive at the soundest and\r\nbest conclusion, and that our conclusion may, for the sake of the\r\nInstitution and of the Province, be sanctioned by that authority to\r\nwhich under the Statutes it must be submitted. We offer no further\r\narguments for the propriety of not leaving religious instruction and\r\npublic worship unattended to, or inadequately provided for, in a College\r\nwhich is destined to conduct in a Christian country the education of\r\nyouth at a period of life when they are most exposed to temptations, and\r\nwhen, if ever, the attempt should be made to furnish them with the\r\nhighest and most sacred motives to the discharge of their religious and\r\nmoral duties.\r\n\r\n\"We do not believe that there is, rationally speaking, a choice between\r\nthe two alternatives, of omitting wholly to establish any system of\r\nreligious instruction and public worship in the College, or of providing\r\nfor it by placing the Institution in strict and acknowledged connection\r\nwith some one recognised Church or form of doctrine. Not assenting to\r\nthe former course, we have unanimously agreed on the latter, and we have\r\nin favour of the course we have adopted the examples of the Universities\r\nof the Mother Country, which have been for ages looked up to with\r\nundiminished confidence and respect. We have also in its support the\r\nacknowledged favour of an experiment made in England under many\r\nadvantages to recommend it to public favour, an University established\r\non other principles; and we have, in addition to this, the very strong\r\narguments to be derived from the well supported and most useful\r\nInstitutions of learning established in Lower Canada in strict\r\nconnection with the Roman Catholic Church, and from the efforts made by\r\nthe Roman Catholics, the Church of Scotland, and the Methodist Society\r\nto found Colleges in Upper Canada as closely connected with their\r\nrespective religious bodies,--Colleges in which there is not only\r\nnothing taught contrary to their respective Creeds, but in which the\r\nwhole government and business of the Institution is carefully confined\r\nto those who profess the one form of Doctrine.\r\n\r\n\"We have considered, too, that while these Religious Bodies, comprising\r\ntogether the great bulk of the population, have given this strong and\r\nplain evidence of their conviction that this system is the soundest,\r\nthey have not thought it unreasonable to solicit the aid and countenance\r\nof the Government and the Legislature towards the establishment of such\r\nColleges, and have not found their solicitations hopeless. So far as\r\nregards our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects, who form a great majority of\r\nthe population in this portion of Canada, we do not apprehend that we\r\nshall be offending any prejudices of theirs, for we believe they would\r\nbe as unwilling to throw impediments in the way of Institutions of\r\nLearning not intended to belong exclusively to their Church, as they\r\nwould be reluctant to admit the interference of others in the management\r\nof their own valuable Seminaries where the exclusive maintenance of one\r\nform of doctrine and worship tends to secure in all respects the\r\nadvantages of unity and peace.\r\n\r\n\"It then only remains, in the view which we have taken on the subject,\r\nthat we should state shortly the reasons which have led us, where we\r\nthought a connection with some one Church should be established and\r\nacknowledged, to make that Church the Church of England.\r\n\r\n\"They are these:--1st. The founder, Mr. McGill, is silent in his will\r\nupon the subject of religion, and gave no direction to which these\r\nStatutes will be repugnant. He was himself a member of the Church of\r\nEngland, in communion with that Church. We do not feel at liberty to\r\nimagine that he desired religious instruction to be excluded, and we\r\nthink it reasonable to believe that in selecting some Church whose\r\nministration should be recognised in the College which he intended to\r\nfound, he would naturally have desired the choice to fall on that Church\r\nof which he was a member.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. The Charter which appoints us to be Governors declares that His\r\nMajesty desired the erection of this University in order to provide for\r\nthe instruction of youth in the principles of true religion, as well as\r\nin the different branches of Science and Literature; and whatever may be\r\nthe honest convictions of opposing Churches and Sects, we think it right\r\nto assume that when the Sovereign speaks of the principles of true\r\nreligion, he means that which is the prevailing National Religion of the\r\nBritish Empire, and which he must himself have solemnly professed. We\r\nconsider, therefore, that in placing McGill College on the footing\r\nproposed, we have taken the only course which we could satisfactorily\r\naccount for, whatever may be the opinions or acts of others, whom it\r\ndoes not rest with us to control.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. While other religious communities have their separate Colleges\r\nclosely connected with their form of doctrine and worship and partaking\r\nof public support, there is none in the Province of Canada which is\r\nbound by plain and acknowledged ties to the Church of England. We have\r\nfelt it not to be unjust or illiberal to allow to the members of that\r\nChurch this advantage so desirable to themselves in an Institution\r\nfounded by the munificence of one of their communion while the youth of\r\nall other religious bodies may, in the discretion of themselves and\r\ntheir parents, resort to it for instruction in the several branches of\r\nScience, with the assurance that no attempt will be suffered to be made\r\nto bias their religious belief; and with the satisfaction at the same\r\ntime of knowing, that whenever instruction in Religion may be desired,\r\nit cannot be uncertain in what form it will be conveyed.\r\n\r\n\"We hope that our fellow-subjects of all persuasions will view, without\r\njealousy or alarm, the provisions which we have proposed to make on this\r\nsubject, and that they will carry their liberality so far as to give\r\nefficient aid to an Institution, founded, as we believe, on the only\r\nprinciples of which reason and religion can approve,--namely, the\r\nprinciple of giving it a known and acknowledged religious character. At\r\nall events, we have not refrained from adopting that course which our\r\njudgment has led us to prefer; we have had no difficulty in resting in\r\nthe conclusion which we have come to, and no difference of opinion among\r\nourselves. It now rests with Her Majesty to dispose of these measures,\r\nwhich we humbly submit to the Royal consideration.\"\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government, however, on the advice of the\r\nGovernor-General, ultimately withheld their assent from the\r\ncontroversial clauses referred to.\r\n\r\nBefore the College was opened the Governors made a final effort to\r\ncurtail the powers of the Board of the Royal Institution. They\r\nconsidered that with the erection of College buildings the duties of the\r\nBoard in connection with the McGill bequest were at an end and that with\r\nany other buildings which might later be erected the Board was not\r\nconcerned. They wrote to the Royal Institution and to the\r\nGovernor-General setting forth their views. \"If the Board's power is\r\nwhat is stated and assumed,\" they said, \"it will not be possible for the\r\nGovernors to attain the object of the Charter.\" They deplored the spirit\r\nin which the authority of the Board had been exercised. They assumed\r\nthat James McGill intended his bequest to be administered by the Board\r\nonly until buildings were erected and a Charter granted to a Corporate\r\nbody, for the Board's control was primarily over grants from the Crown\r\nand not from private individuals. The Board had now, therefore, no legal\r\nexistence, for the objects for which it had been created were gone. It\r\nwas clearly apparent, in their judgment, that when he gave control of\r\nhis bequest to the Board, James McGill thought public funds would be\r\nadded to his gift; this, they believed, was proved by the stipulation of\r\n\"ten years\" after his death as the required term for the erection of the\r\nCollege; hence he had given his bequest to the Board simply and solely\r\nbecause they controlled public funds given for education. But\r\npractically no public funds had been regularly given; hence the Board's\r\ncontrol automatically ceased.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow here the Governors' subtle reasoning. They\r\nseem to have forgotten the Provincial funds granted from the Jesuits'\r\nEstates, and to be unmindful of the fact that they were at that very\r\nmoment still pleading for a Provincial grant, as indicated in the letter\r\nquoted above. They justly emphasised, however, the necessity of\r\nproviding a convenient power of management within the College itself and\r\nthe ending of the dual control. It was absurd, they rightly contended,\r\nthat every cent expended for a piece of stove pipe or a chair should be\r\nfirst approved by the Board. The Governors resented, too, the\r\nvisitatorial power of the Royal Institution. \"In what spirit,\" they\r\nasked, \"and for what purpose do they carry out the right of visitation?\"\r\nSuch power was useful, they declared, only for the purpose of\r\ninterposing in the minutest details of the management of McGill College,\r\nalthough a Corporation and a board of Governors existed for that\r\npurpose; the Royal Institution, in short, was, in its connection with\r\nMcGill, nothing more than \"a source of interference and impediment,\" and\r\nthe Governors asked that the Legislature should investigate the whole\r\nsituation with a view to remedying it. This appeal, like the others,\r\nfailed to make any impression on the authorities, and the causes of\r\nfriction were not removed.\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere of discord and dissension and disputed powers the\r\nCollege buildings were opened on September 6th, 1843, and collegiate\r\ninstruction was at last commenced in accordance with the founder's\r\nbequest. Twenty-two years had passed since the College had been\r\nestablished by Charter, and fourteen years had gone since its actual\r\nopening. They were years of doubt and uncertainty, of protracted\r\nlitigation and differences, even of virulent wrangling and bitter\r\nstrife. But amidst it all and in the face of all its obstacles, the\r\nCollege had gone slowly but steadily forward. Its sign-posts had pointed\r\nonward. Reading to-day the troubled pages of its early story revealed in\r\na mass of musty documents written by hands long since folded, or\r\ndictated by voices long since stilled,--which then helped to shape its\r\ndestiny,--we wonder how it survived. The explanation lies in the fact\r\nthat the men who guided it, whether of Governors or of Royal\r\nInstitution, were men of unfaltering faith; they believed in the future\r\nof McGill; amidst their disagreements and their controversies, they\r\nnever lost sight of the founder's hope although their ways for the\r\nfulfilment of that hope lay often painfully apart. From the struggles of\r\nits early years McGill now emerged to be an established fact. The first\r\nof its buildings, the present Arts or Centre Building, had been erected\r\nand opened. The College had at last an actual home. But the days of its\r\ntravail and its worry, its poverty and its depression, its fight for\r\nlife itself, had not yet passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGE IN THE FIRST MCGILL BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original College buildings were opened for the reception and\r\ninstruction of students on September 6th, 1843. Only twenty regular\r\nstudents were in attendance during the first session, seventeen of whom\r\ntook the Classical course and three the Mathematical course. Steps were\r\nat once taken to provide an adequate collegiate education as called for\r\nin the founder's will, and to organise the teaching and administration\r\non as extensive and sound a basis as the available funds would permit. A\r\nfew books and some scanty school equipment were received from the Normal\r\nSchool recently closed. The fees of students were fixed at £5 a year, of\r\nwhich £1 13s. 4d. was assigned to the Senior Professor as his portion,\r\n6s. 8d. to the Bursar, and the remaining £3 to the \"House Fund.\" In\r\naddition, each student paid to the Registrar who was also Secretary and\r\nBursar, a matriculation fee of 10 shillings which that official was\r\nallowed to keep for his own use. The fees were reduced a few months\r\nlater to £3, of which the House Fund received £2 13s. 4d., and the\r\nBursar 6s. 8d. Students under fourteen years of age and over eighteen\r\nwere not allowed to matriculate into the ordinary classes except in very\r\nexceptional cases. The matriculation examination was at first mainly in\r\nLatin and Greek Grammar and the 1st Book of Cæsar's Commentaries.\r\nStudents who failed to pass this examination were allowed to enter the\r\nCollege and were formed into a separate class. They paid an additional\r\nentrance fee of 10 shillings and an annual fee of £2, for which they\r\nwere not to expect the attention given to other students. Students over\r\neighteen were permitted to enter as \"Fellow Commoners,\" and were allowed\r\nthe special privilege of dining at \"the high table.\" They paid a double\r\nmatriculation fee, and their ordinary fee was twenty-five per cent\r\nhigher than that of other students. For a brief time only there was a\r\ncommon dining-room, but because of financial storm and stress and the\r\nnecessity for additional room this was in the end abandoned and the\r\nstudents boarded with the professors who had rooms in the College.\r\nIndeed, the willingness to accept students as boarders seems, in some\r\ncases at least, to have been a condition of appointment, and little\r\nchoice in the matter was left to the professor. It was decided that all\r\nexaminations for degrees should be held \"within the walls of the College\r\nin the presence of all the officers of the University and College,\" and\r\nthat every candidate for a medical degree \"must forward his inaugural\r\ndissertation to the Principal before the last day of March.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of the building, Principal Bethune and the\r\nGovernors looked about for additional professors or instructors or\r\ntutors. In negotiating with prospective tutors it was pointed out that\r\n\"no gentleman would be elected to a Tutorship who was not able to\r\ntranslate fluently the works of Horace, Xenophon, and Herodotus,\r\ntogether with the other Classical authors of that stamp; and that an\r\nexamination of all candidates would be held.\" One candidate inquired\r\nabout rooms in the College for himself and his wife, but the\r\nVice-Principal replied, \"I must inform you that there will be no\r\naccommodation for your wife in the College at present, but that you will\r\nyourself be expected to reside within the College. The Tutor is not\r\nallowed his board during the long vacation.\" In February, 1844, William\r\nWickes, M.A., a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, was appointed\r\nProfessor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. He was promised £20 to\r\ndefray his travelling expenses \"as soon as it can be paid.\" Mr. E.\r\nChapman was appointed Tutor, at a salary of £100 a year payable, it was\r\nhoped, from students' fees, and his board and lodging; and the Rev. Dr.\r\nFallon was appointed Lecturer in Divinity.\r\n\r\nBecause of the shortage of funds it was decided that no further\r\nappointments could then be made and that only absolutely necessary\r\nexpenses should be incurred. A valuable lot of scientific instruments,\r\nwhich would be of use in the Natural Philosophy classes, was offered to\r\nthe College \"for £70 if paid in six months, or £81 4s. 6d. if paid after\r\nthat time.\" The Secretary replied that \"they would take the instruments\r\nbut they could not name any period of payment.\" The Governors were\r\nsorely pinched for funds during this first year, and the anxieties of\r\npoverty pressed hard upon the College authorities. In January, 1844, the\r\nGovernors made a formal demand for the payment of expenses incurred by\r\nthem amounting to £1,736, and also for the payment of all monies in the\r\nBoard's possession. The Board had but little money at their disposal and\r\nthey refused to grant the Governors' request. The gross annual income\r\nwas then scarcely more than £500, while the salaries and fixed charges\r\namounted annually to £730. The Board accused the Governors of having\r\nmade \"wasteful and extravagant expenditures without precedent or\r\nprinciple,\" some of which did not appear to have any connection with the\r\nopening or the carrying on of McGill; many of these, they said, were\r\nwholly unnecessary, and had never been authorised by the Board, whose\r\nconsent had not even been asked. The expenditures for contingencies\r\nalone, it was pointed out, amounted in five months to more than the\r\ntotal income of three years. \"It is obvious,\" the Secretary added, \"that\r\nthe Governors and the Board entertain views entirely opposite as to the\r\nnature of the trust committed to the Board and to the duties which that\r\ntrust imposes.... There can be no proper understanding between the Board\r\nand the Governors until it can be authoritatively settled which view of\r\nthe duties and the functions of the Board is right according to law. The\r\nBoard has no desire to retain funds to which they have no right.\" In\r\nNovember, 1844, application was accordingly made to the Law Offices of\r\nthe Crown for a decision, but as usual the decision was slow in coming.\r\nBut pending the decision the Board agreed to liquidate the legal debts\r\nas far as they were able and they did so to the extent of £1,550. By so\r\ndoing the Board reluctantly sacrificed a part of the capital of the\r\ntrust and thereby diminished by £90 the annual income, which was already\r\ninsufficient. But this payment was only a temporary relief; the debt was\r\nin reality over £2,500; other and larger accounts remained unpaid, and\r\nliabilities continued to increase.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1844, in order to make the academic management of the College\r\nmore democratic, the Governors made provision for the formation of a\r\nCollege Board which should hold weekly meetings. As early as 1841 the\r\nBoard of the Royal Institution had recommended the formation of a\r\nCollege Council \"for the ordinary exercise of discipline,\" consisting of\r\nthe Principal, the Vice-Principal and Professors, the Rector of Christ\r\nChurch, Montreal, and the Minister of the Church of Scotland, Montreal.\r\nThis recommendation was not considered, pending the actual opening of\r\nthe College buildings. The College Board now formed consisted of \"the\r\nPrincipal, the Vice-Principal, Professors, and (until the whole number\r\nof Professors in the University be increased to six) the Lecturers in\r\nthe Faculties in Divinity and the Arts, not under the degree of M.A.,\r\nand of the person holding the office of Secretary, Registrar and Bursar,\r\nprovided he shall be a graduate of some University in the British\r\nDominions and not under the degree of M.A.\" This Board was called \"the\r\nCaput\"; two of the members, with the Principal or Vice-Principal,\r\nconstituted a quorum. Its duty was to frame rules and regulations for\r\nthe discipline and internal government of Lecturers, students and\r\n\"inferior officers\" of the College, to supervise the system of living\r\nwithin the College, and to consider applications for degrees, except\r\nhonorary degrees. It had no jurisdiction over the Medical School.\r\n\r\nThe period that followed was a period of critical wrestling with\r\nfinancial troubles. The College was suffering from lack of funds. Part\r\nof the cost of the erection of the buildings was yet unpaid. An action\r\nwas instituted against the Governors on account of the College\r\nfurniture, the payment for which was long in arrears. Tradesmen and\r\nworkmen were pressing for a settlement of their bills, and lawyers'\r\nletters threatening suits were daily coming in. The salaries of\r\nProfessors were not paid, and in January, 1845, only £250 was given by\r\nthe Board to pay the combined yearly salaries of Professors, Tutors and\r\nBursar. The Vice-Principal's allowance of fuel for the entire year was\r\nreduced to \"30 cords of maple wood and 2 chaldrons of coal.\" Frequently\r\nappeals were made to the Home Government for assistance, but the\r\nauthorities disagreed in their opinions on the actual state of the\r\nCollege. They had little first-hand knowledge of the facts, and their\r\nattitude was one of indifference or at least delay. Lord Stanley wrote\r\nfrom the Colonial Office: \"I cannot but regret that the circumstances of\r\nthis Institution should have hitherto prevented the Province from\r\nderiving the benefit which its founder contemplated; and as the chief\r\nobstacle at present consists in the want of funds, I am of opinion that\r\nmeasures should be taken to procure the requisite assistance from the\r\nLegislature.\" On the other hand, Lord Metcalfe, the Governor-General,\r\nreplied, \"The financial prospects of the Institution appear to be more\r\npromising than was formerly anticipated.\" There the matter for the time\r\nended, and while the authorities waited and differed, the future\r\nexistence of the College was in grave doubt.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent, too, that internal dissension was growing within the\r\nCollege itself. Charges in connection with the administration and with\r\nthe Principal's management were laid before the Royal Institution by the\r\nVice-Principal, who seems to have had the support of certain other\r\nCollege officers, including Professor Wickes, and the Tutor, Chapman. As\r\na result of these charges, combined with the hopeless financial\r\nsituation in which the College was floundering, the Board of the Royal\r\nInstitution determined to exercise their visitatorial power and to make\r\nan investigation. They would examine the entire working of the College,\r\nits discipline, its administration and also the methods of collecting\r\nand expending the rents and profits of the Estate of which no adequate\r\naccounting had for some time been received. The visitation was made on\r\nthe 13th and 14th of November, 1844, and the meetings, not always\r\npeaceful, were held in the council-room of the College. The Visitors\r\nfound that there were five Professors or Instructors, while only nine\r\nstudents were enrolled in the college, that there was a lack of harmony\r\namong the College officers, \"some of whom were not on speaking terms\r\nwith each other,\" and that the outlook was not promising.\r\n\r\nThe following official report was forwarded to Lord Metcalfe, the\r\nGovernor-General, by the Lord Bishop of Montreal, the Rev. Dr. Mountain,\r\nPrincipal of the Royal Institution, on December 11th, 1844:\r\n\r\n\"The Board of the Royal Institution, at the request of Professor Lundy,\r\nVice-Principal of McGill College, and in consequence of a variety of\r\ncircumstances leading them to believe such a step expedient and\r\nnecessary, met at Montreal on the 14th November, and, as Visitors of\r\nMcGill College under the Royal Charter, entered into an examination of\r\nthe whole affairs of that Institution.\r\n\r\n\"The general result of their investigation they are now desirous to lay\r\nbefore Your Excellency, both because it is to Your Excellency's\r\ninterposition that the Board look for obtaining certain important\r\nmeasures, which appear to them indispensable to the prosperity of the\r\nCollege of which they are Visitors and Trustees.\r\n\r\n\"When the visitation of McGill College took place the Visitors found in\r\nit nine students (fewer by half than at the same period last year, and\r\nthese, with one or two exceptions, boys) under the tuition of a\r\nPrincipal, who is also Professor of Divinity, a Lecturer on Divinity, a\r\nVice-Principal, who is also Professor of Classical Literature, a\r\nProfessor of Mathematics, and a Classical Tutor; the establishment\r\nhaving also the services of a Bursar, a Beadle and others. The regular\r\nexpenditure for the College Establishment in salaries and contingent\r\ncharges is two-fold of the income applicable to it; and the Governors\r\nhave contracted a debt of £1,550 in opening the College, the various\r\nitems of which expenditure appeared to the Board to be on a scale of\r\nextravagance and wastefulness entirely unsuitable to the pecuniary\r\nresources of the Institution. There is a great want of cordiality and\r\nharmony among the Professors and Officers of the College; some not even\r\nspeaking to others. There are no Statutes in operation which are binding\r\nin Law.\r\n\r\n\"The Principal refused to acknowledge the authority of the Visitors, or\r\nto furnish them with any information. The united testimony of the\r\nCollege Officers induces the Board to believe that one main reason of\r\nthe College having received so little support is that the\r\nacting-Principal does not enjoy that confidence on the part of the\r\npublic of which an individual, standing in his position, ought to be\r\npossessed....\r\n\r\n\"The Board also had the testimony of the College Officers that the\r\ninefficiency and unpopularity of the College are also, in part, owing to\r\nthe general want of confidence, rightly or wrongly entertained, in the\r\nVice-Principal, Professor Lundy.\r\n\r\n\"The Bursar is the Rev. Mr. Abbott, who has a Salary of £100 a year, and\r\nis permitted to do his duty by Deputy. He does not, he says, understand\r\naccounts; nor do those of his Deputy appear to be regularly and\r\ncorrectly kept.\r\n\r\n\"There are only two Governors resident in Montreal--the Chief Justice of\r\nthe District, and Dr. Bethune, who is a Governor in consequence of his\r\nholding the interim appointment of Principal. The other Governors, who\r\noccasionally act, are the Chief Justice of Upper Canada, and the Bishop\r\nof Montreal, both too distant from the College to take much part in the\r\nmanagement of its affairs, and the latter having only very recently a\r\ntitle to do so. The Chief Justice of Montreal is unwilling, as a Roman\r\nCatholic, to interfere more than he can avoid in the government of a\r\nProtestant Institution; and the practical result of this state of things\r\nin the governing body is to throw almost the whole management of the\r\nInstitution into the hands of Dr. Bethune, the acting-Principal. Both\r\nthe resident Governors resisted the authority of the Visitors, and\r\nrefused to co-operate with them.\r\n\r\n\"Between the Governors and the Board of the Royal Institution certain\r\ndifferences do also exist in respect of the possession of the funds of\r\nthe College, now held in trust by the Board. The Governors are of\r\nopinion that such funds should be unreservedly handed over to them. The\r\nRoyal Institution, acting on the opinion of eminent Counsel, and holding\r\nthat in this course they are supported by manifest expediency, as well\r\nas Law, decline to make such transfer. The knowledge of the Public that\r\nsuch differences exist is also stated as one ground of the want of\r\npublic confidence in the Institution.\r\n\r\n\"A more full and accurate account of the whole investigation, contained\r\nin the Minutes of the Board, is herewith respectfully submitted for Your\r\nExcellency's information; but such, we have to state to Your Excellency,\r\nis generally the disorderly and inefficient state of an Institution from\r\nwhich the public looked, and were justly entitled to look, for great\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n\"The remedy for existing evils is, it appears to the Board of Visitors,\r\nto be sought in various quarters. In part, it rests with the Board\r\nitself to apply a remedy; and, in so far, they are prepared to act\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n\"The differences between the Board and the Governors may be settled by\r\nan amicable suit in a Court of Law; or by the opinion of the Law\r\nOfficers of the Crown. The Board have repeatedly expressed to the\r\nGovernors their desire to have the matter so decided.\r\n\r\n\"And the debts of the Institution the Board are also prepared to\r\nliquidate, though in doing so they must of necessity trench deeply on\r\nthe capital in their possession.\r\n\r\n\"And the changes of the Institution itself, which the Board consider\r\nnecessary, and which it is more immediately the province of the\r\nGovernors to effect, are these:\r\n\r\n\"1st. To obtain the services of an able and efficient Principal,\r\npossessing the public confidence, who should reside in the College, and\r\ntake an active part in the education of the students.\r\n\r\n\"2ndly. To dispense with the Office of Vice-Principal altogether, which,\r\nin that case, would be unnecessary, and to confine Professor Lundy's\r\nduties entirely to the work of Classical Instruction.\r\n\r\n\"3rdly. To dispense with the Office of Bursar, and require the nowise\r\nonerous duties thereof to be performed by some of the Resident Officers\r\nof the College.\r\n\r\n\"4thly. To dispense with the services of a Classical Tutor till the\r\nattendance of students render them necessary, which, at present, is\r\nmanifestly not the case.\r\n\r\n\"Preparatory, however, to these changes, and without which, indeed, they\r\ncannot be carried into effect, there needs, the Board would humbly\r\nrepresent, an interposition of Her Majesty's Government for the removal\r\nof the present Principal, and for an addition to the number of Governors\r\nresident in Montreal.\r\n\r\n\"The Board of Visitors believe they are by Law entitled to remove the\r\nPrincipal from his Office on the sole ground of his contumacy in\r\nrefusing to appear before them; and they have restrained from depriving\r\nhim of his Office by their own authority, simply by a consideration of\r\nthe still greater disorder which must have been the result of the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n\"The Board of Visitors would, however, represent to Your Excellency\r\nthat, in their judgment, such removal is indispensable to the well-being\r\nof the College; and that as Dr. Bethune was never appointed, except\r\ntemporarily, and his appointment has never received the necessary\r\nsanction of Her Majesty's Government; if that sanction were refused, the\r\noffice would be forthwith vacant, and it would be competent for the\r\nGovernors to appoint an able and efficient Principal in his stead.\r\n\r\n\"Even such removal, however, would serve but little purpose, greatly as\r\nthe Board believe it would contribute to restore public confidence,\r\nunless an addition were made to the number of Governors resident in\r\nMontreal. If three or four enlightened and intelligent men were united\r\nin the government of this institution, who, from their residence in\r\nMontreal, could give a fair share of their attention to its interests,\r\nthe most beneficial consequences might be expected; and the public\r\nconfidence would be greater if, in the selection of these Governors,\r\nregard should be had to different Protestant bodies in the Provinces,\r\nnone of which (except by such limitation as may be conceived to be\r\nincluded in the words 'sound religion') are, by any Clause, either of\r\nMr. McGill's will, or of the Royal Charter, excluded from the Offices,\r\nHonours, or Benefits of the College.\r\n\r\n\"May it therefore please Your Excellency to use your influence with Her\r\nMajesty's Government to refuse to sanction Dr. Bethune's appointment,\r\nand to give, as speedily as possible, a Supplementary Charter, making an\r\naddition to the number of resident Governors in Montreal. The Board are\r\npersuaded that the result of such action on the part of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment would be to rescue the College from its present disorderly\r\nand inefficient state, and to render it, according to the intentions of\r\nthe benevolent founder, a public benefit.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the justice of this report the Governors entered a vigorous and\r\nemphatic protest. They denied the right of the Royal Institution as\r\nVisitors to investigate College conditions. They contended that McGill\r\nUniversity was a private foundation, and as such might only be \"visited\r\nby the legal representatives of James McGill and not by the Sovereign\r\nLady the Queen, her heirs or successors, or by any person or body\r\nappointed by the Crown as supposed and assumed in the Royal Charter\r\nincorporating the College.\" As the Statutes had not yet been approved,\r\nthey forwarded at the same time a resolution to the Colonial Office\r\ndeclaring that \"the College being a private foundation has the undoubted\r\nright and power as such to make its own Statutes, Rules, etc.,\" and that\r\nthey would therefore no longer wait for the Royal sanction. They also\r\nmade representations to the Legislative Assembly asking support for\r\ntheir contention that \"the provision of the Charter by which the right\r\nof the Crown is reserved to disallow the appointments made by the\r\nGovernors is an assumption of power inconsistent with the very nature of\r\nthe Foundation and is absolutely null and void in Law.\" They sought\r\nlegal means for obtaining from the Royal Institution all rights and\r\ntitles to the properties and monies in their possession belonging to\r\nMcGill University. Their main argument was that the University was a\r\n\"private institution.\" But their protests were of no avail.\r\n\r\nThe Governors then summarily dismissed the Vice-Principal and Professor\r\nof Classics, the Rev. F. J. Lundy, mainly because of the allegations he\r\nhad made before the Royal Institution. His dismissal caused further\r\ntrouble, not, however, without its lighter side. Dr. Lundy appealed to\r\nthe Royal Institution from the Governors' decision. In his petition he\r\nsuggested that the Governors who dismissed him were not a representative\r\nbody and that their action was illegal. He stated that \"the Chief\r\nJustice of Montreal and the Rev. John Bethune, _two_ of the Governors of\r\nMcGill College, did proceed to hold a special meeting in the parlor of\r\nthe residence of the Chief Justice and not at the College; that ...\r\nwithout previous summons or notification he was there informed ... [on\r\nbeing called in] that his further services were not required in the\r\nCollege, and that he was accordingly dismissed ... without any semblance\r\nof a trial or investigation. ... That on asking for an explanation he\r\nwas informed that no explanation would be rendered and that he would not\r\nbe allowed a hearing in the matter.\" With his appeal the Royal\r\nInstitution, in the absence of Statutes and Rules, was powerless to\r\ndeal. Dr. Lundy was dismissed on the 4th of January, 1845. He was\r\nallowed to retain his rooms in the College until May 1st \"because of the\r\ninconvenience to his family of moving in winter,\" but he was considered\r\n\"as removed on and after the day of his dismissal.\" In June he was still\r\noccupying his College rooms, and he was told by the Governors to vacate\r\nthem or he would be ejected in fourteen days. In July he was still\r\nthere, and the Governors again told him that if he was not out at the\r\nend of two days they would remove him, \"using no more force than might\r\nbe necessary for that purpose.\" He went; and the controversy ended.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wickes then became Vice-Principal, but he retired two years\r\nafterwards. Chapman, the Tutor, became Lecturer in Classics, but he\r\nretired a few weeks later. His salary was long in arrears and he could\r\nnot collect it, and when he left he had to be content with a return of\r\nthe money he had expended \"in making a window into a door in his room.\"\r\nThe Beadle was also dismissed, and the entire personnel of the College\r\nofficers was soon changed. Other appointments were made and were\r\napproved by the Royal Institution. In making the appointments provision\r\nwas made for \"a Librarian,\" and the Rev. Joseph Abbott was selected as\r\nthe first Librarian of McGill at the beginning of 1845. The Royal\r\nInstitution considered the Governors' actions to be growing daily more\r\ndrastic and intolerable, and they urged the Home Government to take\r\nsteps to end the struggle between the two bodies. On January 13th the\r\nLord Bishop of Montreal, the Rev. Dr. Mountain, who had meanwhile become\r\none of the Governors of the University, again wrote to the\r\nGovernor-General, Lord Metcalfe, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is with extreme unwillingness that I obtrude upon Your Excellency,\r\nwith the purpose of their being submitted if you should see fit, to Her\r\nMajesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, any\r\nrepresentation relating to the affairs of McGill College, in addition to\r\nthose which are already before you from other quarters; and it is with\r\nfeelings of a nature more seriously painful that I find myself compelled\r\nto state to Your Excellency the conviction at which I have arrived, of\r\nits being inexpedient for me to take my seat at the Board of Governors\r\nof that institution so long as the Rev. Dr. Bethune, in virtue of his\r\nacting as Principal of the College, is also a member of the Board.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency will readily believe that unless I had strong and what\r\nI conceive to be imperative grounds for my proceeding, one of the last\r\nthings which I could possibly be prompted to do would be to bring under\r\nthe notice of Her Majesty's Government any disadvantageous exhibition of\r\nthe management of important public interests in the hands of one of my\r\nown Clergy, and one who occupies so prominent a position in the Canadian\r\nChurch as the Rector of Montreal.\r\n\r\n\"I have, however, long felt that the College could never prosper while\r\npresided over by Dr. Bethune. And I should have been impelled before\r\nthis day officially to submit my views upon the subject to Your\r\nExcellency had it not been that I had no seat among the Governors till\r\nafter the passing of the Act of the last Session, which confers upon me,\r\nas Bishop of Montreal, all the legal powers vested in the Bishop of\r\nQuebec; and, moreover, that having all along regarded the appointment of\r\nDr. Bethune simply as an ad interim arrangement (in which I believe\r\nthere are abundant means of showing that I was perfectly correct) I\r\nanticipated that his retirement would have taken place in time to save\r\nme from the necessity of making official statements, from which it is\r\nsufficiently obvious that I must desire to be spared.\r\n\r\n\"When, however, I consider the general character of Dr. Bethune's\r\nproceedings in those matters connected with McGill College which it has\r\ndevolved upon him to conduct, or in which he has taken a leading part,\r\nand more especially in the intercourse of business with the Royal\r\nInstitution for the Advancement of Learning; when I consider again his\r\ntoo evident deficiency in very important points of qualification for his\r\noffice, such as academical experience (for he never studied at any\r\nUniversity), actual classical attainments of the nature and extent which\r\nthe case requires, and I am constrained to add, such temper, such\r\ndiscretion, and such weight of personal influence and possession of\r\npublic confidence, as must be necessary on the part of the Principal, to\r\npreside with effect over an infant University in a country like this, or\r\nto execute his part in recovering it from the utterly inefficient and\r\ndiscreditable condition in which it now lies, I am brought to the\r\nunavoidable conclusion not only that his appointment ought not to be\r\nconfirmed, but that every delay in the disallowance of it opens a door\r\nto some new mischief within the Institution; more particularly as the\r\npowers committed to the body of Governors, in something more than their\r\nmere ordinary exercise, are, from peculiarity of circumstances, in a\r\nmanner left in his hands. The long continued ill health and infirmity of\r\nthe Chief Justice of Montreal, the consequent seclusion in which he\r\nlives, and the fact of his not having either the sort of interest in the\r\nInstitution or the opportunities of familiarly knowing the relations\r\nsubsisting between Dr. Bethune and other parties concerned which he\r\nwould naturally have if he were of the Protestant religion, appear, I\r\nmay venture to say it, to justify the conclusion that the proceedings of\r\nthe Governors resident at Montreal are to be regarded as little or\r\nnothing more than the decisions and acts of the individual filling the\r\noffice of Principal, at the same time that they have in several\r\ninstances involved a result of which I can hardly be persuaded that two\r\nGovernors were sufficient to dispose. These proceedings have been\r\nrecently crowned by the summary dismissal, without a hearing, of the\r\nVice-Principal and Professor of Classical Literature, under\r\ncircumstances with which Your Excellency, as I am informed, has recently\r\nbeen made acquainted. I feel that I am now called upon to state to Your\r\nExcellency both as the Head of the Body of Governors, whenever you may\r\nsee fit to take part in their proceedings, and also as the Head of the\r\nGovernment, that till Dr. Bethune shall cease to occupy a place at the\r\nBoard of Governors I must abstain from attending it, persuaded as I am\r\nthat I cannot do so either with the hope of advantage to the public or\r\nwith comfort to myself.\r\n\r\n\"With reference to the question intimated above, respecting the\r\ncompetency of two Governors to dispose of some matters such as have\r\nactually been disposed of by that number only, Your Excellency is aware\r\nthat the number to whom the wisdom of Government had originally within\r\ntheir particular province confided the interests of the College was\r\nseven, and comprised the highest functionaries of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada: and I conceive it to be necessary for those interests, not to\r\nsay for the very existence of McGill College, that an efficient Body of\r\nGovernors should, as soon as possible, be given to the Institution.\r\n\r\n\"I have only to add, although it is not within the more immediate scope\r\nof the representations here submitted, that the observations which I\r\nhave made with reference to the inexpediency of Dr. Bethune's retention\r\nof the office of Principal, will manifestly suggest reasons of at least\r\nequal force against the confirmation of his appointment to the\r\nProfessorship of Divinity.\"\r\n\r\nThis communication was forwarded by the Governor-General to the Colonial\r\nOffice, but over a year passed before definite action in connection with\r\nit was taken by the authorities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Governors carried on the work of the University, harassed\r\nalways by debts and by insufficient revenue. The Medical School now\r\nsought a closer union with the University. Its connection with the\r\nCollege since the latter's establishment had been more or less nominal;\r\nit was at least indefinitely hazy, other than in the mere fact that it\r\nwas \"engrafted,\" and in the imprimatur of its degrees. Since its request\r\nfor a grant from University funds six years before was refused, there\r\nwas little actual intercourse or connection between the two bodies. They\r\nworked, on the whole, independently, although the legal incorporation of\r\none with the other was recognized. The Medical School had carried on its\r\nwork in temporary quarters. It had begun its work in 1824 in a building\r\nat 20 St. James Street, on Place d'Armes. Its Statutes, Rules, etc., had\r\nbeen approved, as already seen, in 1832. About a year later the School\r\nwas moved to a larger building near the present Bank of Montreal, where\r\nit remained for more than two years. It then was again moved to a\r\nbuilding on St. George Street, not far from the corner of Craig Street.\r\nIn 1843 the Medical Faculty applied to the Governors for a piece of\r\nground on the Burnside Estate, near the recently erected McGill\r\nbuildings, \"for the purpose of erecting lecture rooms.\" The request was\r\ngranted and the giving of sufficient ground was approved by the Royal\r\nInstitution. But like the College, the Medical School had no funds. The\r\ngrant asked for from the Provincial Government by the Board of the Royal\r\nInstitution to help \"in bringing the Faculties of Law, Theology and\r\nMedicine into actual operation,\" and partly promised, had in the end\r\nbeen refused. The Royal Institution, as we have seen, did not feel\r\njustified in giving the Medical School assistance from the funds already\r\ninadequate to provide for Collegiate education, as called for in the\r\nbequest. As a result, although ground for a building was willingly\r\ngiven, the erection of a building had to be indefinitely postponed. The\r\nMedical Faculty then applied for permission to use any rooms that might\r\nbe available in the College buildings. On September 16th, 1845, the\r\nGovernors agreed--and the Royal Institution later approved their\r\naction--to give the Medical School the refectory or dining-room for its\r\nexclusive use--as the students were now for the most part boarding with\r\nProfessors or outside the College--together with the southwest\r\nlecture-room as a lecture-room and museum, the private room of the\r\nBursar for the Professors' office, and two small adjoining rooms \"for\r\nanatomy and dissecting rooms.\" Medical students, too, were to be\r\npermitted to reside in the College, on condition that they were to be\r\nunder the same discipline as the College students. The Medical Faculty\r\naccordingly moved to these rooms provided in the McGill buildings, and a\r\ncloser contiguous connection with the University was thereby\r\nestablished. There the Faculty remained until 1851, when because of its\r\ngrowth and the inconvenient distance from the city and the Hospital, it\r\nmoved to the building at 15 Coté Street, erected for its use by three of\r\nthe members of its staff.\r\n\r\nEfforts were made to increase the attendance in the College and students\r\nfrom the French-Canadian Colleges were admitted to equal standing with\r\nMcGill students. The need for funds became gradually more acute. The\r\nRoyal Institution would not listen to the Governors' demands for the\r\npayment of salaries and contingent expenses. In December, 1845, they\r\nagain appealed to the Governor-General, Lord Metcalfe, but he declined\r\nto interfere, pointing out that the Royal Institution were the trustees\r\nof the Trust; that all the Statutes, Rules, etc., of the College should\r\nbe confirmed by Royal authority before they became law; and that as the\r\nstatutes under the authority of which debts had been contracted by the\r\nGovernors of McGill had never received Royal sanction, these debts had\r\nno effect in law. The Governors were therefore themselves liable. But\r\nthe Governors had already borrowed £500 from the Bank of British North\r\nAmerica to meet necessary and vital requirements. That amount had not\r\nyet been paid off, and they naturally were not disposed to assume the\r\nresponsibility for further personal indebtedness.\r\n\r\nAll the correspondence in connection with the whole situation, in\r\naddition to the various petitions and appeals, was forwarded to the\r\nColonial Office, with which the Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone had meanwhile\r\nbecome connected as Secretary of State for the Colonies. It was hoped\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone would display more interest and energy than his\r\npredecessors, and that a decision would soon be reached. The College\r\nauthorities expected that the Provincial Legislature would be asked to\r\nmake an investigation by Committee. Accordingly, on April 15th, 1846,\r\nthey issued instructions \"forbidding officers and members of the College\r\nfrom answering any summons from a Committee of the Legislative Assembly\r\nacting on the petitions of Chapman, Wickes or Lundy.\" The excuse for not\r\nanswering was that \"McGill College was a private foundation and was\r\ntherefore not liable to the action of the Legislature.\" But their\r\nexpectations were not realized and no investigation was held by the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nIt was clear, however, that action was soon to be taken by the Colonial\r\nOffice; the Governors were not aware of the precise nature of the\r\naction, but they felt that the Home Government would support the Royal\r\nInstitution. Before the decision was received, a final effort was made\r\nto give to the University a more pronounced character of \"religious\r\nexclusiveness,\" a tendency which the Governor-General had already\r\ndeplored. In October, 1845, this desire had been indicated by the making\r\nof a rule requiring that prayers in the College were to be said \"by a\r\nCollege Chaplain appointed by the Governors, or by any other person\r\nappointed or approved by the Principal, he to be a member of the Church\r\nof England\"; a sum of £50 was voted for such Chaplain. On April 25,\r\n1846, at a meeting attended by two Governors--the Chief Justice of\r\nMontreal and the Principal, and two Fellows--the Rev. J. Ramsay and the\r\nRev. J. Abbott, it was resolved on motion of the Principal to ask that\r\nthe Charter be amended in the following particulars: \"That the\r\nGovernors of the College consist henceforth of all the clergy of the\r\nChurch of England now holding or who may hereafter hold preferment in\r\nthe Parish of Montreal, and of a certain number of laymen of the Church\r\nof England resident in the aforesaid Parish to be named in the Charter.\r\nThat vacancies occasioned by the death, resignation, etc., of any of the\r\nlay Governors shall be filled up from time to time by the majority of\r\nthe Governors present at a meeting. That the Bishop of the Diocese shall\r\nbe the Visitor of the College. That appointments to office in the\r\nCollege are not to be subject to disallowance by any other authority\r\nthan that of the Governors. That the Statutes, Rules, and Ordinances\r\nmade by the Governors are to be in full force and effect until\r\ndisallowed by the Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench for the District\r\nof Montreal. That a committee be appointed to draft a petition to Her\r\nMajesty the Queen with reference to this resolution, the Committee to\r\nconsist of the Principal, the Vice-Principal, and the Professor of\r\nClassical Literature.\" The Professor of Classical Literature was then\r\nthe Rev. W. T. Leach, who had been appointed on April 4th preceding. The\r\nVice-Principal was the Rev. J. Abbott.\r\n\r\nA few days later, and before this resolution could be acted on, however,\r\nMr. Gladstone's despatch disallowing Principal Bethune's appointment and\r\nasking for his retirement was received. In forwarding it to the\r\nSecretary of McGill on April 24th, 1846, the Civil Secretary wrote: \"I\r\nhave only to add the expression of the hope that the Governors will\r\nforthwith proceed to replace Dr. Bethune and that in so doing they will\r\nanxiously endeavour to secure the services of a man in all respects\r\nqualified for such important posts.\" Mr. Gladstone's despatch, which\r\nembodied in the main the suggestions of the Lord Bishop of Montreal, the\r\nRev. Dr. Mountain, quoted above, was written on April 3rd, 1846, and was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have had under my serious consideration your Lordship's confidential\r\nDespatch of the 19th of February, on the subject of McGill College at\r\nMontreal, and in connection with it I have reviewed the copious\r\ncorrespondence which passed between your Lordship's predecessor and Lord\r\nStanley on this question. I have observed with great regret the state of\r\ndisorder and inefficiency in which the Institution appears to be.\r\n\r\n\"The question which has appeared to me to call for my immediate decision\r\nis that of the continuance in the office of Principal of the College,\r\nand in the Professorship of Divinity, of the present holder, the\r\nReverend Dr. Bethune, whose appointment it is still competent for the\r\nCrown, according to the Charter of the College, to disallow.\r\n\r\n\"It is with regret that I have come to the conclusion that it is my duty\r\nto recommend to Her Majesty to disallow this appointment.\r\n\r\n\"Into the various and somewhat complicated charges which have been\r\nbrought against Dr. Bethune, in his capacity of Principal of the\r\nCollege, I do not find it necessary to enter; nor do I wish to state at\r\nthe present moment any decided opinion as to the extent to which the\r\npresent condition of the Institution is owing to the character and\r\nposition of its Principal. My decision is founded upon reasons which\r\nare not open to dispute; the first, the weight of the Bishop's\r\nauthority, together with your own, independently of any reference to\r\nthat of the Board of Visitors, which may be considered to be to some\r\nextent at this moment in dispute; next, the fact that Dr. Bethune did\r\nnot himself receive an University education, which I must hold to be,\r\nunless under circumstances of the rarest occurrence, an indispensable\r\nrequisite for such a position as he occupies. To these I am disposed to\r\nadd, although I express the opinion without having had the advantage of\r\nlearning what may be the view of the Lord Bishop in this particular,\r\nthat I cannot think it expedient that the offices of Principal and\r\nProfessor of Divinity in McGill College should be combined with that of\r\nRector of Montreal. This latter circumstance is not much adverted to in\r\nthe papers before me; but I am strongly impressed with the incongruity\r\nof this junction of important collegiate appointments with a no less\r\nimportant pastoral charge in the same person; either the former or the\r\nlatter of which, especially considering the large population of the Town\r\nof Montreal, I must, as at present advised, hold to be enough to occupy\r\nhis individual attention.\r\n\r\n\"I have, therefore, felt bound to advise Her Majesty to disallow this\r\nappointment in both respects, in pursuance of the power vested in her;\r\nand have only to add the expression of my hope that the Governors will\r\nforthwith proceed to replace Dr. Bethune, and that in so doing they will\r\nanxiously endeavour to secure the services of a man in all respects\r\nqualified for such important posts.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the general position of the College, there are indeed\r\nmany points as to its Constitution, its Laws, its Revenues, and its\r\nAdministration which obviously require a careful consideration and an\r\nearly and definitive settlement; among which perhaps the most prominent\r\nis the confirmation, or otherwise, of the Statutes which have for some\r\ntime been awaiting the decision of the Crown. But adverting to the\r\ncourse adopted by Lord Stanley, and to the information received from\r\nyour Lordship's predecessor, with particular reference to the Despatches\r\nnoted in the margin, I have resolved to suspend any active measure on my\r\npart, at least till the conclusion of the present session of the\r\nCanadian Legislature, thinking it not improbable that the proceedings of\r\nthat body may tend to throw some light on the questions connected with\r\nthe College, by which I may be guided in the consideration of my own\r\ncourse in this important matter.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above despatch, Dr. Bethune retired from the\r\nacting-Principalship in May following. On July 3rd he protested in a\r\nmemorial to the Colonial Office against the legality of the act of the\r\nHome Government in the disallowing of his appointment, but no action was\r\ntaken by the authorities, and there the matter dropped.\r\n\r\nDr. Bethune did not give up the acting-Principalship, which he had\r\nfilled for eleven years, without the regrets and the tributes of men who\r\nhad been closely associated with him during his term of office. The\r\nChief Justice of Montreal, the Hon. James Reid, one of the Governors of\r\nthe College, had already written to him on February 13th, 1845, not long\r\nbefore his death:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Painting in McGill Library Photo Rice Studios\r\n_Venerable Archdeacon Leach D.C.L., L.L.D. Vice-Principal of McGill\r\nUniversity_ 1846-1886]\r\n\r\n\"I am enabled to say that after your appointment as Principal the\r\ninterests of the College, which had previously been much obstructed and\r\ndelayed, were more closely pursued and attended to, principally by your\r\nexertions, your declared object being to bring the College into\r\noperation as soon as possible, and to render all the means belonging to\r\nit available for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 11th, 1846, after Mr. Gladstone's despatch had been received, and\r\nDr. Bethune was about to leave the College, the Rev. John Abbott, the\r\nVice-Principal and Secretary, and E. Chapman, formerly Lecturer in\r\nClassical Literature, whose relations with the Principal had not always\r\nbeen harmonious, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We, the undersigned Officers of the University of McGill College, from\r\nour personal knowledge, as far as we have been respectively connected\r\nwith it, do hereby certify that the Reverend John Bethune, D.D., has\r\nperformed the duties of his Office of Principal of this Institution with\r\na zeal, ability, and moderation only equalled by his patient and\r\nenduring perseverance, under circumstances of great and harassing\r\ndifficulty; and that the opening and establishing of the College, and\r\nconsequently its very existence, are mainly to be ascribed, as we verily\r\nbelieve, to his active and indefatigable exertions.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter the Rev. W. T. Leach, who had been appointed Professor of\r\nClassical Literature on April 4th preceding, added:\r\n\r\n\"My connection with McGill College has been of very recent date, and I\r\nhave no objection to add my testimony to the above.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also certified by the Bursar, the Rev. John Abbott, that the\r\nPrincipal was jointly responsible with the Chief Justice of Montreal\r\nfor £500 borrowed from the Bank of British North America, and for £100\r\nfor outbuildings; that he was personally responsible for a debt of £120\r\nfor fuel, which \"by his own individual means and credit he had obtained\r\nand provided for the College while the funds belonging to it were\r\nwithheld during a considerable period.\" These liabilities, however, were\r\nall liquidated later by the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nThe eleven years that had passed since the acting-Principal assumed\r\noffice were among the most critical in McGill's history. They were\r\nfraught with a hopeless misunderstanding arising from a dual control,\r\nthe causes of which have been made sufficiently clear in the documents\r\nquoted. The Governors resented the interference of the Royal\r\nInstitution, which in those days of advocacy of political autonomy and\r\nsensitive abhorrence of Downing Street coercion they could not easily\r\ntolerate. It was contrary to the spirit of the age. Whether the\r\nGovernors helped their cause by their attitude or by their attempt to\r\ngive to the College a character of sectarian exclusiveness need not be\r\nhere discussed. They had, however, urged the actual erection and\r\nequipment of a College, and it was in a large measure because of their\r\npersistence and their faith that the original buildings were so early\r\nconstructed. They had the good fortune to see the buildings actually\r\nopened, students enrolled and collegiate instruction commenced in\r\naccordance with the will of the founder. They saw, too, the Medical\r\nSchool made an integral part of the University.\r\n\r\nAnd the controversy in which they had so prominent and at times so\r\npainful a part, although unfortunate in many ways, had at least one\r\ngood result--it showed plainly and unmistakably the hopelessness of dual\r\nsupervision and divided authority. Nevertheless, by the dissension of\r\nthose bitter years of storm and stress the College had been brought\r\nfinancially, at least, to a feeble and uncertain state, and many who\r\nwatched its progress were wondering if it could still endure. But again\r\nit struggled forward. Those who were really interested in its existence\r\nnever doubted its ultimate concord and prosperity and growth. But to\r\nbring it to its destined place of usefulness and power it needed\r\nunfaltering strength and unwavering faith to guide it through the\r\ntroubled period that lay yet before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 7th, 1846, the Governors of McGill met at Government House to\r\nappoint a Principal to succeed Dr. Bethune. The meeting was attended by\r\nthe Lord Bishop of Montreal, the Rev. Dr. Mountain; the Chief Justice of\r\nUpper Canada and the Governor-General. The seriousness of the situation\r\nthat had developed was indicated by the presence of the two last named\r\nmembers, who had not attended a meeting for several years. It was\r\nresolved that pending a decision on the former acting-Principal's\r\nmemorial to Her Majesty's Council, protesting against the disallowance\r\nof his appointment, a temporary appointment of Principal be made. The\r\nchoice was Edmund A. Meredith, B.A., LL.B., a graduate of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. He was at once informed of the Governors' decision; he\r\naccepted the post and took his seat at the meeting. He was to receive no\r\nremuneration for his services. The condition of the College was reviewed\r\nby the Governors and was found to be critical. Dr. Holmes of the Medical\r\nSchool reported that no degrees had been conferred in the spring \"in\r\nconsequence of the disallowance by Her Majesty of the former election of\r\nPrincipal.\" The Governors therefore changed the date for the conferring\r\nof Medical degrees from the 25th of May, previously fixed, to \"a date to\r\nbe agreed upon by the Governors on application from the Medical\r\nFaculty,\" and the deferred Medical degrees were given at a convocation\r\nheld on December 17th, following. It was found that the liabilities of\r\nthe College amounted to over £3300, made up of £2300 for old unpaid\r\nbills and over £1000 for arrears of Professors' salaries. The revenue of\r\nthe College was shown to be only about £900 a year, and the current\r\nexpenses, exclusive of salaries, about £500 a year. The financial\r\noutlook, considering the large liabilities, was therefore not\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Edmund A. Meredith, L.L.D.\r\nPrincipal of McGill University_ 1846-1849]\r\n\r\nThe new Principal, Edmund A. Meredith, was the son of the Rev. Thomas\r\nMeredith, D.D., a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and a mathematician\r\nof distinction. His mother was a daughter of the Very Rev. Richard\r\nGraves, also a Fellow of Trinity, Dean of Ardagh, and a theologian of\r\nnote. He graduated in 1837 from Trinity College, Dublin, where he won\r\nthe second classical scholarship, the prize for political economy, and\r\nthe graduation medal in science. He then began the study of law, but\r\nbefore his course was completed he came to Canada in 1843. Here he\r\nresumed his legal studies, and on fulfilling the requirements he became\r\na member of the Bar in both Upper and Lower Canada. When he was\r\nappointed Principal of McGill he was a lawyer in active practice in\r\nMontreal. In scholarship he was well qualified for his duties, as\r\nLecturer in Mathematics and as Principal of the struggling College in\r\nwhich courses had to be arranged and the whole academic policy reformed.\r\nHe was possessed, too, of unusual administrative ability and of legal\r\nknowledge of great value in that time of College chaos and disagreement;\r\nand he displayed uncommon tact and abundant patience and energy in his\r\nefforts to solve the delicate problems with which the University was\r\nthen confronted. It was largely through his initiative that the movement\r\nwas undertaken for the securing of a new Charter. In 1847 he accepted\r\nthe post of Assistant Provincial Secretary, but as the seat of\r\nGovernment was then in Montreal he still remained Principal of McGill.\r\nAfter the burning of the Parliament Buildings and the violence in\r\nconnection with the Rebellion Losses Bill, when the seat of Government\r\nwas moved to Toronto, Mr. Meredith tendered his resignation as Principal\r\non October 26, 1849. He was induced to retain the Principalship,\r\nhowever, although living in Toronto, until a successor could be found,\r\nand it was not until 1851 that he finally withdrew. His name appears as\r\nPrincipal in documents of that year. In recognition of his services the\r\nUniversity conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1857. When\r\nThomas Workman gave the workshops to the Faculty of Applied Science he\r\ndirected that a sum of $3000 be paid to the former Principal, Dr.\r\nMeredith, \"inasmuch;\" he said, \"as I have long been convinced of the\r\nvalue of the services rendered to the University of McGill by Edmund A.\r\nMeredith, LL.D., during a very critical period of its history.\" Dr.\r\nMeredith afterwards became Under-Secretary of State for Canada, and he\r\nwas connected with the Civil Service until 1878.\r\n\r\nThe nine years between 1846 and 1855 were years of continuous financial\r\nperplexity during which the Governors had great difficulty in keeping\r\nthe College in operation. There is little else to record than a\r\ndiscouraging battle with poverty and want. But in this period hope for\r\nultimate success was not abandoned. The new Board of Governors had first\r\nto reorganize the teaching staff and make new appointments. In addition\r\nto his other duties the Principal undertook to conduct, as Lecturer, the\r\nclasses in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. The Professor of\r\nClassical Literature, the Rev. W. T. Leach, was made Vice-Principal in\r\nSeptember, 1846. It was also realised that in a country of two languages\r\ninstruction in French was an absolute necessity. No funds were available\r\nfor the purpose, but Monsieur L. D. Montier accepted the position of\r\nLecturer in return for lodging and fuel and a portion of students' fees,\r\non the understanding that he was to receive a salary of £30 a year as\r\nsoon as money was available. But students' fees, because of the small\r\nnumber in attendance, gave but little reward, and as a result the new\r\nFrench Lecturer was apparently not always as zealous and enthusiastic in\r\nhis unremunerative labours as the Caput desired. It frequently happened\r\nthat for several days he gave no instruction, and soon after his\r\nappointment the Caput censured him for neglecting his work and for\r\n\"conduct highly reprehensible and subversive of all College discipline.\"\r\nIn recognition of his services, however, and perhaps to keep him from\r\nbecoming weary in well-doing, the Governors allowed him half an acre of\r\nland \"in the northeast corner of the College grounds, to pasture his cow\r\nand make a garden,\" from the products of which they hoped he might\r\nreceive some slight return for his work. The Rev. G. F. Simpson,\r\nHeadmaster of the High School, consented to act as Lecturer in\r\nMathematics without any salary or fees. In March, 1847, the Hon.\r\nJustice Badgley, LL.D., was appointed Lecturer in Law without\r\nremuneration other than fees, and instruction in Law which later led to\r\nthe establishment of the Law Faculty was commenced during the following\r\nterm. In July, 1848, a Lecturer in Hebrew and Oriental Languages was\r\nappointed without salary. It was decided not to appoint a Professor of\r\nDivinity in succession to Dr. Bethune, not only because of the lack of\r\nfunds, but because the clauses in the Statutes bearing on the nature of\r\nthe theological instruction to be given had not yet been agreed upon by\r\nthe Home Government.\r\n\r\nBut the gravest and most important duty of the new administration was in\r\nconnection with the serious financial condition of the University, and\r\nwith efforts to improve the situation. When the Governors met in July,\r\n1846, the Professors and Lecturers, some of whom had already retired\r\nbecause of resignation or dismissal, appealed to them for payment of\r\ntheir salaries. They had worked without pay for several months, and in\r\nsome cases for a year and a half. It was even difficult for them to\r\nobtain fuel and candles. The Governors expressed their \"sympathy with\r\nthem in their embarrassment and distress,\" but regretted that they were\r\nunable to relieve them. The Vice-Principal was given land behind the\r\nCollege to enable him to make a garden, \"on condition that he would not\r\ninterfere with the Bursar's garden.\" The Governors and the Board of the\r\nRoyal Institution were unwilling to encroach upon the meagre capital to\r\npay for ordinary running expenses. They believed that if the burden of\r\ndebt which the College carried could be removed they could meet in some\r\nway all current obligations, and that there would be no doubt about the\r\nfuture success of the University. In liquidating the debt they hoped for\r\nassistance from the Government. In November, 1846, the Secretary of the\r\nGovernors wrote: \"The prospects of the College are now in so promising a\r\nstate as to lead the Governors to entertain the most sanguine hopes, if\r\nthey would but be relieved from their present embarrassments, of\r\nsucceeding in carrying into full effect the great object its benevolent\r\nfounder had in view.\" But their hopes for direct assistance from the\r\nGovernment or the Home authorities were not early fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that the removal of the burden of debt without\r\nGovernment assistance would be an arduous task uncertain of\r\naccomplishment, and that a problematical period doubtless lay ahead.\r\nMany of the debts were of ten years' standing. Some of them had been\r\nincurred with mechanics and tradesmen in connection with the\r\nconstruction of the College buildings. Professors had long been unpaid.\r\nSince July, 1845, no money had been placed at the disposal of the\r\nGovernors to meet expenses. The Statutes for the government of the\r\nCollege were still unsanctioned by the Crown, and this fact and the\r\ndispute between the Board of the Royal Institution and the Governors\r\ncontinued to furnish an excuse, whether valid or not is questionable,\r\nfor paying no money for several months out of College funds. The\r\nGovernors had borrowed from the Banks on their own personal security,\r\nand had obtained small sums at different times on their own personal\r\nundertaking to pay for fuel and to meet the most pressing demands made\r\nby absolutely necessary contingencies. Were it not for this timely\r\nassistance it is probable that the College would have been closed; its\r\nfortunes at best were precarious.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution had meanwhile concluded to transfer to the\r\nReceiver-General of the Province all sums paid to them on account of the\r\nCollege. But the Receiver-General would not pay them to the College\r\nauthorities, pending the Crown's decision on the Statutes. The Governors\r\nurged the Royal Institution to a hasty consideration of their\r\nembarrassment. They did not blame or censure the Board for the\r\nextraordinary situation in which they found themselves. In the question\r\nas to the cause of the situation they were not primarily interested.\r\nDebating on the responsibility for it and on bygone disputes would not\r\nimprove it. The fact was plain that the College's existence was in the\r\nbalance because of financial conditions, and that this fact must be\r\nfaced. \"The buildings are becoming dilapidated and useless,\" they wrote,\r\n\"and those who inhabit them will be frozen or starved unless the\r\nGovernors contribute from their private means.\" They likewise vigorously\r\ncalled the attention of the Home Government to their incongruous and\r\nlamentable plight. \"We desire earnestly,\" they said, \"to impress upon\r\nHer Majesty's Government that the attainment of the benevolent and noble\r\nobject of the founder of McGill College has been unfortunately if not\r\nculpably delayed.\" Yet they insisted that the present problem \"will work\r\nout and the whole income will soon be available for expenditure.\" There\r\nwould then be no difficulty, they thought, \"in maintaining the College\r\non a scale large enough to be of use in a colony of a million people\r\nwithout means for obtaining education for youth.\" And they declared\r\nwith astonishing optimism, \"the Governors have great hopes that when\r\nonce fairly put in action this Institution will speedily attract\r\npatronage and support and will expand with the wealth of the country.\"\r\nThis note of courage and faith is all the more remarkable when we\r\nrealise the exact condition of the University, without money, without\r\nStatutes, a fact which was used as an excuse for withholding funds, with\r\nbut little sympathy from Provincial Government or Home Government, with\r\nits few Professors unpaid and pleading even for fuel and light, with\r\nunfinished and poorly equipped buildings falling rapidly into decay,\r\nwith grounds uncared for, and with a very small enrollment of students.\r\n\r\nThe Governors were determined, however, not to decrease the capital\r\nfunds of the College and that payments, if any, must be made out of\r\nsurplus revenue. In this they had the approval and co-operation of the\r\nBoard of the Royal Institution. Nor did they wish to dispose of any of\r\nthe land until it was absolutely necessary to do so, and then only with\r\na unanimous consent. They made an effort first to increase the value of\r\ntheir real estate. A large portion of the land had been let for pasture\r\nand for grass, but the leaseholders were slow to pay the rent and many\r\nof them were several months in arrears. The Board of the Royal\r\nInstitution now endeavoured to collect all rents promptly when due. They\r\ndecided to discriminate between their own various debts. They would pay\r\ntradesmen first, in the order of the age of their bills. When the\r\ntradesmen had all been paid they would then pay the Professors, but not\r\nuntil all other debts had first been liquidated. The Professors must\r\nwait. An agreement was then entered into with the various creditors to\r\npay their debts off in installments. In order to secure more revenue the\r\nstudents' fees were increased. They had already been raised from £3 to\r\n£4 6s. 8d., of which £2 13s. 4d. went to the House Fund, 6s. 8d. to the\r\nBursar, the same amount to the Library, and £1 to the servants. The fees\r\nwere now advanced to £10. Every matriculant was also to pay £1 5s. to\r\nthe Bursar for his use and benefit, and all students were to deposit\r\n10s. \"caution money,\" to cover breakages and damages to furniture, this\r\ndeposit or the portion of it not used to be refunded in the spring.\r\nExpenses during this period were reduced to a minimum. In 1845 the large\r\ndining-hall or refectory had been given over to the Medical Faculty, and\r\none of the small rooms had then become the dining-room. In 1847,\r\nhowever, because of the financial loss incurred even the small\r\ndining-room was closed and, as we have seen, the students boarded with\r\nProfessors. In 1848, when Law students were first permitted to reside in\r\nthe College, it was on the express condition that \"Professor Leach would\r\nboard them.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessity for much needed repairs to fences and buildings and for\r\nfuel for the College rooms called urgently for funds. But there was no\r\nmoney to provide these necessities. Permission was asked and received by\r\nthe Governors to pull down and remove an old wooden hut on the College\r\ngrounds, \"which had long been considered an unsightly object and a\r\nnuisance fast falling to decay.\" It was arranged that \"the boards of the\r\nroof and floor would mend fences and that the old logs would be used for\r\nfuel.\" It was later decided to sell the surplus furniture in the\r\nCollege, scanty enough at best, and also the sand that had been taken\r\nfrom the excavations for the buildings, the money from the sales to be\r\nput to \"repairs to the spouts of the buildings and to the fences, also\r\nto bring water from the spring near the bridge [in the present\r\n'hollow'], to put a railing on the bridge, and to make passable the road\r\nbetween the College and Sherbrooke Street.\" But in the midst of all\r\ntheir financial worries the determination of the College authorities to\r\nencourage students is evident from their establishing two exhibitions of\r\nthe value of £10 each, to be awarded yearly to the two students standing\r\nhighest in the matriculation examination. Professors might starve or\r\nfreeze and creditors might wait, but ambitious and meritorious students\r\nmust be practically encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe Governors were at last given some slight relief by the receipt of\r\nover £1400, on account, from the Receiver-General, to whom the revenues\r\narising from College funds and properties were being periodically\r\ntransferred by the Royal Institution. Of this amount only £50 was voted\r\nfor current expenses; the remainder was used to pay off a portion of the\r\ndebts, among them the amount borrowed from the Bank by the former\r\nPrincipal and the Chief Justice of Montreal. A further sum of £280 was\r\nreceived by the Governors from rentals, of which £100 was paid to the\r\nVice-Principal, £100 to the Bursar, Registrar and Secretary, £50 to the\r\nProfessor of Mathematics and £30 to the Lecturer in French, in part\r\npayment of their long overdue salaries. But it was decided that in\r\nconsideration of these payments \"no fuel could be provided for the\r\npresent for any College officer.\"\r\n\r\nThe relief resulting from the above receipts was of but brief duration.\r\nIn November, 1848, the Governors had only the sum of £54 at their\r\ndisposal. They divided it between the Bursar and the two Lecturers in\r\nproportion to the amount of salary in arrears, and as a result the\r\nLecturer in French, M. Montier, received £2 14s. as his share from\r\nJanuary 1st, 1848, to November 29, 1848. That was the full amount of\r\nsalary received by him during the year; but he still had his cow and his\r\ngarden! As if to increase the worries of the College authorities the\r\nCollege buildings caught fire on January 24, 1849. Fortunately the\r\ndamage was only small, but any damage, however trifling, could at that\r\ntime be ill-afforded. To add to the embarrassment, several of the few\r\nstudents enrolled failed to pay their fees, and the Bursar could not\r\ncollect them. In February, 1849, he was in urgent need of funds, and on\r\nthe 13th he sent out to the student debtors appealing letters of which\r\nthe following is typical: \"I beg that you will pay your fees this week\r\nif possible, as I have a heavy College claim to meet on Saturday without\r\nthe wherewithal to pay it.\" He supported this appeal by letters to\r\nparents, \"I beg that you would be good enough to pay your son's College\r\nfees on or before Saturday next, as I have a heavy College debt to pay\r\non that day and not sufficient funds to meet it.\" These appeals were not\r\nalways successful, and the revenue from this source remained indefinite.\r\nIn the spring the students who had paid their dues were not given back\r\nthe caution money they had deposited because \"no funds were available.\"\r\nThere is a record of one student, more persistent than the others, who\r\nwas difficult to placate. He was finally promised that his \"caution\r\nmoney would be refunded when possible,\" and he was assured that \"funds\r\nwould soon be available because the Statutes would soon be ratified.\"\r\n\r\nThe gross revenue available to the College in 1849 was £494, made up of\r\n£70 from the rent of Burnside House, £274 from rents of building lots\r\nand other lands, and £150 from the rent of a large stone building known\r\nas the King's Arms or Mack's Hotel, situated on Jacques Cartier Square,\r\nformerly Nelson's Market. The rent of this latter building was first\r\n£250 a year, but from depreciation in value because of the removal of\r\nthe Market it had decreased by £100. After deducting the amounts\r\nrequired for insurance, etc., the net revenue was only about £440. Only\r\nthirteen students were in attendance; two of these had obtained\r\nexhibitions and were admitted free, and the income derived from the fees\r\nof the remaining eleven was £110. The salaries, which, however, were\r\nseveral months in arrears, amounted to £292 a year. The Principal\r\nreceived no remuneration. The salary of the Rev. W. T. Leach,\r\nVice-Principal and Professor of Classical Literature, was supposed to be\r\n£100; that of T. Guerin, Lecturer in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy,\r\n£50; the Hon. W. Badgley, Lecturer in Law, received no stated reward,\r\nbut he was entitled to a fee of £2 per term from each student attending\r\nhis lectures; the Rev. J. Abbott, Registrar, Bursar, Secretary, and\r\nLecturer in Ancient and Modern History, Geography and Logic, was\r\nsupposed to receive a salary of £100, and in addition several small fees\r\nfrom students, which amounted the previous year to only £4 5s.; L. D.\r\nMontier, Lecturer in French, received £30 a year, and the Beadle, F.\r\nHewitt, was given £12; the Lecturer in Hebrew, the Rev. A. De Sola,\r\nreceived no salary. Later in the year a lecturer in Botany was appointed\r\n\"without remuneration for the present.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board of the Royal Institution endeavoured earnestly to relieve the\r\nfinancial situation of the College, and they requested the\r\nReceiver-General to make all possible payments to the Governors. But the\r\nliabilities far exceeded the assets. In January, 1850, the College\r\nofficers urgently pleaded for their overdue salaries. It was decided to\r\npay them 2s. 9d. in the pound. Accordingly, Vice-Principal Leach\r\nreceived £55 of the £404 in arrears; L. D. Montier, the Lecturer in\r\nFrench, was given £4 of the £34 due him, and the others were paid very\r\nsmall amounts in proportion for a year or, as in the case of the\r\nVice-Principal, several years of work. A grant of £25 was asked for by\r\nthe College authorities to purchase books for students, but it was of\r\nnecessity refused. The supply of fuel for the year was reduced to \"ten\r\ncords of maple wood,\" and altogether the outlook of the College was not\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Statutes, Rules, etc., which had been forwarded to the\r\nColonial Office for Royal sanction in 1843, had been approved with some\r\nalterations, and the Royal confirmation was announced in a despatch from\r\nLord Grey to Lord Elgin, the Governor-General, on September 27th, 1848.\r\nThe Home Government had delayed their approval of the Statutes because\r\nthey were not sure of the attitude of the Provincial Legislature towards\r\nthe College. Remembering the political events of 1837 and realising as a\r\nresult Canadian resentment of any semblance of dictation or coercion,\r\nthey decided to proceed with caution. In this they followed the advice\r\nof the Governor-General, Lord Metcalfe, who, as we have seen, strongly\r\nurged delay and a careful consideration of the clauses bearing on\r\nreligious instruction, in his despatch of September 6, 1843. To this\r\ndespatch Lord Stanley replied from Downing Street on October 13, stating\r\nhis approval of the suggestions and expressing his desire to meet first\r\nthe wishes of the Provincial Assemblies. \"It is evident,\" he said, \"that\r\nthese questions cannot be decided without the intervention of the\r\nLegislature of Canada and that it must rest with the Provincial\r\nParliament to determine whether pecuniary aid shall or shall not be\r\nafforded to the College.... It could answer no useful purpose, but may\r\nlead to a most embarrassing controversy if, by the confirmation of those\r\nStatutes ... Her Majesty should hazard a collision on such topics as\r\nthese, between the Royal Authority irrevocably exercised and the future\r\nrecommendation of both or either of the Houses of local Legislature.\r\nConsequently, until I shall be apprised of the results of their\r\ndeliberations, the decision of the Queen will be suspended.\"\r\n\r\nThere were rumours that a bitter attack against the College, its\r\nadministration and its religious exclusiveness would be made in the\r\nLegislature, and that a Bill would be introduced which might possibly\r\nlead in the end to its abolition. Lord Metcalfe feared such a\r\npossibility. But no attack was made, and on January 17, 1844, the\r\nGovernor-General wrote to Downing Street: \"No attack was made on McGill\r\nCollege in the shape of a Bill during the late Session. The Institution\r\nperhaps owes its escape to the prudence of the French Canadian party,\r\nwho, having several Roman Catholic Colleges that are exclusive, are not\r\ndisposed generally to join in attacking other Institutions on account of\r\ntheir exclusiveness, lest the same weapons should be turned against\r\ntheir own. Under those circumstances McGill College being in Lower\r\nCanada appears to be in a safer position than it seemingly occupied\r\nbefore the late Session; and I do not consider the expediency of\r\nwithholding confirmation of their Statutes to be so urgent as I then\r\nconceived it. Nevertheless, it is not certain that the Institution may\r\nnot be attacked in any future Session, for the Presbyterians and\r\nDissenters of all classes are bent on destroying the exclusive character\r\nwhich it has acquired in the hands of the Church of England.\" Efforts\r\nwere now renewed by the Royal Institutions to have the Statutes, in part\r\nat least, approved, but the Board was informed by the Colonial Office\r\nthat \"it does not appear to Her Majesty that the College has the means\r\nof sustaining itself on a reasonable scale of efficiency.\" The closing\r\nof the College was looked upon by the Home authorities as a mere matter\r\nof time!\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion and delay, when it seemed probable that the\r\nCollege would weather the storm, the Statutes were finally in part\r\napproved in the autumn of 1848. The time for action had come and the\r\nHome authorities realised that \"further delay might issue in the ruin of\r\nthe College.\" As we have already seen, the clauses relating to the\r\nsectarian character of theological instruction and of the College\r\nprayers were not confirmed. In giving reasons for the vetoing of these\r\nclauses, Lord Grey wrote that in his opinion, based on the advice of\r\nLord Metcalfe, \"aid would not be granted [to the College] if the Royal\r\nconfirmation of the Statutes should first have impressed indelibly on\r\nthat Institution a character of exclusiveness in whatever relates to\r\nTheological degrees and studies and to the public worship of the\r\nplace.... The Will and Charter are both silent on the subject of the\r\npeculiar religious tenets or ecclesiastical principles to be inculcated\r\nat the College, a silence very significant in the case of a Testator who\r\nwas himself the member of a Christian Church, a silence not less\r\nsignificant in the case of the Sovereign ... a silence not to be\r\nexplained by any supposed forgetfulness or intentional omission of the\r\nsubject, since the inculcation of 'the principles of true religion' is\r\nexpressly provided for by the Charter; a silence, therefore, apparently\r\nindicating a design that Christianity should be taught, not in any\r\nsingle or exclusive form, but in any and in every form in which its\r\ngreat fundamental truths and precepts could be imparted to the\r\nstudents.... The questions respecting the religious and ecclesiastical\r\nprinciples to be inculcated in the College will, therefore, for the\r\npresent rest in the same state of indecision as that in which the Will\r\nof the founder and the Royal Charter have left them.\"\r\n\r\nWith the approval of the Statutes, the Governors made an effort to\r\nreorganise the College on a better working basis. In December, 1849, the\r\nPrincipal forwarded to the Board of the Royal Institution suggestions\r\nfor amendments to the Charter in order to provide a greater freedom of\r\naction which might render the management more efficient. This step\r\nresulted largely from a report sent to the Governors by the Board of the\r\nRoyal Institution, setting forth the latter's observations on conditions\r\nfound during their official Visit in 1848, and including an outline of\r\nthe remedies they thought should be applied. The Board approved of their\r\nsuggestions and urged immediate consideration of the question. Three\r\nmonths passed without action. Meanwhile a peculiar situation had\r\ndeveloped. The Principal of the College had desired in October, 1849, to\r\nresign, as he was about to move to Toronto because of the change in the\r\nseat of Government. He was now Assistant Provincial Secretary. But as no\r\nsuccessor was available he was persuaded to retain the office for the\r\npresent, although no longer able, because of his residence in Toronto,\r\nto take a very active part in College affairs, or to exercise any direct\r\nsupervision over the administration. The remaining Governors consisted\r\nof the Lord Bishop of Montreal, who resided at Quebec; the Chief Justice\r\nof Upper Canada, the Hon. J. Beverley Robinson, who, like the Principal,\r\ndwelt in Toronto; and the Governor-General, Lord Elgin, who, after he\r\nhad been attacked by a mob in 1849 as a result of his attitude on the\r\n\"Rebellion Losses Bill,\" no longer resided in Montreal. None of the\r\nGovernors was therefore able to exercise any oversight of the College of\r\nwhich they were the legal guardians. In April, 1850, a Committee of the\r\nBoard of the Royal Institution was appointed to suggest a solution of\r\nthe peculiar problem. They wrote to the Governor-General, setting forth\r\nthe absurdity and the hopelessness of a condition which permitted the\r\nCollege to be controlled by Governors no longer resident in Montreal,\r\nand emphasising the necessity that existed for \"a prompt application of\r\nremedies to relieve the College from its present unfortunate state of\r\ndepression.\" They urged an amended Charter as the first requirement. A\r\nlong correspondence followed between the Board and the individual\r\nGovernors, relating to the details of the Charter. In June the Board's\r\nCommittee wrote again to the Governor-General, stating that if the\r\nCharter were amended according to the draft prepared \"McGill College\r\nwould speedily be relieved from the difficulties by which it has been so\r\nlong surrounded.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board desired to amend the original Charter rather than to abrogate\r\nit in order not to raise any question of the tenure of the estate\r\nthrough a lapse of possession. They feared that between the brief period\r\nof time which would necessarily intervene between the annulment of the\r\nold Charter and the passing of the new, the heirs-at-law of James McGill\r\nmight, even at that late date, claim that the College no longer existed\r\nin fact, and that they were entitled to the estate. They therefore\r\npreferred an amended Charter, even if more cumbersome. One of the\r\namendments provided that the members of the Board of the Royal\r\nInstitution should henceforth be the Governors of the College, the\r\nmembers still to be appointed by the Crown. The number of Governors was\r\nleft indefinite, but the Board suggested strongly that \"the number\r\nshould not be less than thirteen, and that they should be selected from\r\nthe different Protestant denominations in the city and district of\r\nMontreal.\" Later they suggested that the number should be nine or\r\neleven, exclusive of ex-officio members. They pointed out that \"so long\r\nas the Board of the Royal Institution and the Board of Governors are\r\ncomposed of different bodies of men exercising a co-ordinate and\r\nuncertain jurisdiction over matters very ill-defined ... it is\r\nimpossible to expect either unanimity in the bodies themselves or\r\nharmony in the system.... The only means of imparting to these bodies\r\nunity of action and design will be found in making them identical.\" Such\r\nan amendment would forever end the dual control which had brought about\r\nin the past disaster and depression.\r\n\r\nOther clauses in the amendment provided that all Statutes and Rules of\r\nthe College could be approved by the Governor-General at his discretion\r\nwithout transmission to England; and that the visitatorial power be\r\ntransferred from the Royal Institution and vested in the\r\nGovernor-General. The purpose of the amendments was to simplify the\r\ngovernment of the College and to secure an efficient administration. The\r\nsuggestions with reference to numbers and to the selecting of the\r\nGovernors from the different Protestant denominations were not followed\r\nby the Government. There was much correspondence between the Board and\r\nthe Governor-General and his Council over the proposals. But it was on\r\nthe whole amicable. The objections of one side were always met with\r\nreasonableness by the other, and a harmonious agreement was finally\r\nreached. The Governor-General forwarded the amended Charter to the\r\nColonial Office with his approval and his advice that it should receive\r\nRoyal sanction. The Board of the Royal Institution, realising from past\r\nexperience the slow methods of Downing Street, appointed an agent in\r\nLondon to hasten the passage of the Charter through the different\r\noffices of the Imperial Government. It was not until August, 1852,\r\nhowever, that the amended Charter was finally approved.\r\n\r\nBetween 1849 and 1852 very few meetings of the Governors were held,\r\nowing to the absence of the Governors from Montreal. The affairs of the\r\nCollege were largely in the hands of the Vice-Principal and his\r\nassistants. Conditions gradually became graver. The Lecturers in French\r\nand Mathematics were dismissed because no money to pay them was in\r\nprospect. By 1851 the buildings, which had not been completed and were\r\nuncomfortable at best, had fallen into a dilapidated state. Rain and\r\nsnow fell freely through the cracks in the roof, and leaked to the rooms\r\nbelow. Windows and doors, which in the course of time had been\r\nshattered, were still unrepaired. There was not enough fuel to heat the\r\nbroken and damaged structures, for an allowance of \"ten cords of maple\r\nwood for the winter\" was not sufficient to bring warmth. The College\r\ngrounds were uncared for. Students who dwelt in the city tramped through\r\nsnowdrifts to the cold College classrooms. Because of the discomfort,\r\nthe lack of adequate accommodation, and the inconvenient distance from\r\nthe Hospital and the city, the Medical classes, which had been held in\r\nthe Centre building since 1845, were removed in 1851, as already\r\nrecorded, to the building on Coté Street, built by three members of the\r\nMedical Staff, Drs. Campbell, MacCulloch, and Sutherland, and leased to\r\nthe Faculty. A year later the City began excavations for the reservoir\r\nin rear of the College grounds. The blasting in connection with this\r\nwork did not add to the peace or the safety of student life in McGill,\r\nand later serious breaks in the buildings were caused by heavy stones\r\nfalling on the roof. For these various reasons it was ordered by the\r\nCollege authorities that all occupants except the Vice-Principal should\r\nwithdraw from the College buildings. The chief excuse given was economy,\r\nbut the real reasons were not then disclosed to the public. The Arts\r\nclasses were afterwards carried on in part of the building used for the\r\nHigh School. The McGill buildings were abandoned, except by the\r\nVice-Principal, and it was not until 1860 that they were reoccupied by\r\nthe Faculty of Arts.\r\n\r\nSeveral changes now took place in the administration of the College. In\r\n1851 Principal Meredith resigned. His resignation was followed the next\r\nyear by that of the Rev. John Abbott, who had been Secretary and Bursar\r\nand Registrar for several years. The Hon. Judge Charles Dewey Day was\r\nnow President of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning,\r\nand as such he assumed, in conjunction with Vice-Principal Leach,\r\ndirection of the College management.\r\n\r\nCharles Dewey Day was a native of Bennington, Vermont. While he was\r\nstill a boy he moved with his parents to Montreal, and there he received\r\nhis education. He studied law, and in 1827 he was admitted to the Bar.\r\nTen years later he was made a Queen's Counsel. When the Rebellion of\r\n1837 ended he was appointed Deputy Judge Advocate-General, and he\r\nconsequently had an active part in the courts-martial appointed for the\r\ntrial of accused insurgents. He was made Solicitor-General in 1839. At\r\nthe election of 1841 he was chosen to represent the County of Ottawa,\r\nbut he retired from political life in the following year and accepted a\r\nJudgeship in the Court of Queen's Bench. In 1849 he was elevated to the\r\nSuperior Court. He was later appointed a member of the Royal Institution\r\nfor the Advancement of Learning, of which he became President, and after\r\nthe amended Charter of the University was approved in August, 1852, he\r\nbecame in virtue of that position a Governor of McGill. In 1857 he\r\nbecame Chancellor of the University, a position which he occupied until\r\nhis death twenty-seven years later. He filled many important offices. In\r\n1859 he was one of the Commission entrusted to prepare a Civil Code for\r\nthe Province of Quebec; he subsequently served on Commissions appointed\r\nat different times to determine the amount of the Provincial debt to be\r\nassumed by the Dominion; to investigate the details of the Pacific\r\nRailway scandal; and to settle the amount of subsidy which should be\r\npaid to the railroads for carrying the mails. He also helped to prepare\r\nCanada's case in the negotiations for the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, and\r\nafter his retirement from the Bench he assisted in prosecuting the\r\nHudson Bay Company's claims against the United States under the treaties\r\nof 1846 and 1863. After his appointment as a Governor of McGill, Judge\r\nDay took, a deep and earnest interest in the activities of the College.\r\nHe devoted his energy and his time to advancing the College's welfare,\r\nto removing the causes of its many troubles, and to giving it a place of\r\npower and usefulness in Canada. He died in 1884. He was referred to in\r\nthe contemporary press as \"one of Montreal's most upright, honourable\r\nand useful citizens\"; and speaking a few days after his death, on his\r\nconnection with McGill, Lord Landsdowne said, \"In this University he\r\nleaves an irreparable void and an enduring memory.\"\r\n\r\nWith the approval of the amended Charter in the autumn of 1852, efforts\r\nwere made to reorganise the University, and to commence a forward\r\nmovement. The new Board of Governors authorised and established under\r\nthe amended Charter found the University in an unsatisfactory and almost\r\nhopeless predicament. It was struggling under lamentable deficiencies in\r\nits educational arrangements; it was faced by heavy pecuniary\r\nembarrassments and altogether inadequate resources. It was, in short,\r\ndestitute of funds. Even its buildings had been abandoned, but it was\r\nhoped only temporarily. Conditions in the Faculty of Arts were\r\nparticularly bad. Yet there was hope. It was evident to the Governors\r\nthat an attempt at resuscitation must immediately be undertaken. An\r\nagreement was entered into with creditors for the making of small\r\nperiodical payments with interest. Arrangements were made for the\r\nappointment of a competent Treasurer, and for the holding of regular\r\nmeetings of Governors and of Corporation. A Committee on Ways and Means\r\nwas selected, consisting of the President, Judge Day, and Messrs.\r\nDavidson, Ramsay and Dunkin. The Provincial Government was appealed to,\r\nand in December, 1852, the Legislature gave the College a grant of £1000\r\n\"to help liquidate the debts.\" It was clear that a new era in the\r\nUniversity's life was about to begin, but that persistent energy and\r\ndetermination would be required to guide the University through the\r\nnight that still covered it.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1853, a Finance and Building Committee of the Board was\r\nappointed, consisting of James Ferrier, Benjamin Holmes, and T. B.\r\nAnderson. One of the first acts of this Committee was to take legal\r\nproceedings against the purchasers of lots, for the most part \"persons\r\nof ample means\" who had failed to make payments long overdue. In June,\r\n1853, a sum of £75 was voted by the Governors to complete the portico of\r\nthe Arts Building, \"the Board being very desirous of correcting as soon\r\nas possible the present unsightly aspect of the Centre building.\" They\r\nalso called for estimates for \"the putting up in front of the College on\r\nSherbrooke Street of a fence of the same description as that of the new\r\nCemetery.\" To effect greater efficiency the office of the Secretary of\r\nthe Royal Institution was moved to one of the rooms of the McGill\r\nbuildings--the East wing--in July, 1853, and the Secretary became also\r\nSecretary of the Governors. The two offices became identical. Later,\r\nbecause of the cold and the general discomfort, the office was\r\ntransferred for some time to a building at the corner of Dorchester and\r\nUniversity Streets, known as Burnside Hall. But that conditions there\r\nwere not ideal is evident from an appeal made in December, 1854, to the\r\nfirm that had previously repaired the antiquated furnaces. The Secretary\r\nwrote: \"Instead of imparting to us an equable and cheering warmth such\r\nas might reasonably be expected from their matronly development ... to\r\nme they are painfully and consistently cold. Do, then, come to our\r\nrelief and save us from the horrors of frozen limbs, hospitals and\r\namputations; or first, if you prefer it, pass a morning without\r\novercoat, cap and comforter in my office with the thermometer at zero.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1853 repairs were made to the College buildings in the\r\nhope of making them again habitable. The blasting in connection with the\r\nreservoir had caused much damage. Windows were wholly shattered and\r\nthere were wide cracks and breaks in roof and walls. The contractor\r\nfailed to make restitution, and the City Corporation was then urged to\r\nmake the necessary repairs and to guarantee that there would be no\r\nfurther wreckage. The City authorities were slow to respond, but in the\r\nend they made reparation. Fences were also restored or newly built, and\r\nan effort was made to lay out the College grounds in some semblance of\r\norder. In September the lower part of the grounds was granted free for\r\nthe holding of the annual Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition. In the\r\nspring of 1854 the City threatened to enter suit against the College for\r\nunpaid taxes, but the dispute was amicably settled. The total income\r\nfrom rents on which the taxes were based amounted to £182, of which the\r\nsum of £102 was derived from the rent of Burnside House and gardens, £60\r\nfrom the Professor and £20 from two students who still occupied rooms in\r\nthe College buildings. This income was exclusive of the rents of lots,\r\nwhich amounted to about £400. In the summer of 1854 the Governors gave\r\nto the city free of charge land for the opening of streets \"on condition\r\nthat all the College property shall be entirely exempt from every sort\r\nof assessment until it shall have been sold.\" Land for the opening up of\r\nUniversity Street had been given in 1851. The Streets now provided for\r\nwere Union Avenue, between Dorchester and St. Catherine Streets; McGill\r\nCollege Avenue; Burnside Place; Victoria, Mansfield, St. Catherine,\r\nCathcart, Dorchester, and Monique Streets. It was stipulated that\r\nVictoria Street and McGill College Avenue \"should not be opened, for the\r\npresent, higher than Burnside Place.\"\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the Governors' efforts, the University was still far\r\nfrom adequate prosperity. It was not yet in a flourishing condition and\r\nits outlook while hopeful was not wholly auspicious. Greater\r\nco-operation on the part of the public was obviously needed, and the\r\ncontemporary press frequently deplored the lack of public encouragement.\r\nThere was peace and concord in its administration, but there was little\r\nadvancement in its academic activities. It was clear that it had either\r\nto go forward or to cease to function. It was plain, too, that in\r\naddition to funds a new Principal and several instructors should be\r\nappointed as expeditiously as possible. The Governors, it was rumoured,\r\nwere looking abroad for a Principal; they were also, it was said,\r\nconsidering the reorganising of the College on the plan of English\r\nUniversities. Neither of these suggested procedures was popular, and\r\nneither was in the end followed. In August, 1854, one of the\r\ncontemporary newspapers, the _Sun_, which has long since disappeared, in\r\nreferring to the needs of the University voiced editorially the opinions\r\nof the people:\r\n\r\n\"All we need,\" it said, \"are persons at the helm who will take an\r\n_active interest_ in the progress and advancement of the institution....\r\nIt won't do to sit idly down--to follow the dignified and majestic\r\nexample of Cambridge and Oxford. Montreal is not in England--it is in\r\nCanada. We have a way of doing things for ourselves. It is not necessary\r\nin order rightly to accomplish an end to ask how they do it 'at home';\r\nwe can find out a mode ourselves. McGill College will never be anything\r\nuntil some exertion is made by those who have control of it. A languid\r\nindifference or a sickly half-dead interest will never secure to it a\r\npermanency among the institutions of the day\"; and the writer added that\r\n\"unless measures for its improvement are speedily undertaken there is a\r\ndanger that McGill College will soon be numbered among the things that\r\nwere.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governors in the end decided to look nearer home for a Principal--a\r\nman of strong personality to take the helm in this critical period. They\r\ndetermined, if possible, to appoint a Canadian who was familiar with the\r\ncountry, its spirit, its temper and its educational needs. Down in\r\nPictou County, Nova Scotia, they found him in the person of William\r\nDawson, a native Canadian and a graduate of Edinburgh University. In\r\n1855 they offered him the Principalship. He accepted the position and\r\nbegan his duties in the autumn of that year. In the thirty-four years\r\nthat had gone since its establishment and the twenty-six years since its\r\nopening, the College had struggled through many vicissitudes and trials.\r\nIt had frequently been on the border of extinction. But the crisis in\r\nits troubled history had at last been passed. A new era, more wonderful\r\nand more successful than even its most optimistic friends dared look\r\nfor, was about to begin. The foundations had been laid, perhaps not\r\nalways wisely, but at least firmly and hopefully. The College was now to\r\ngo forward--for again, as in the past, its sign-posts pointed onward.\r\nThe faith of its founder was at last to be justified. It remained for\r\nthe new Principal, William Dawson, to guide it on its unwavering march\r\nto usefulness and to power, and by his tact, his judgment, his wisdom\r\nand his strength to impress his name upon its century story as the man\r\nwho was greatest among \"the makers of McGill\" in the first hundred years\r\nof its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE LIFE IN MID-CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nCollege life in mid-century, or rather in the \"forties and fifties,\"\r\nduring the early dark days of struggle and ten years thereafter,\r\ndiffered greatly from College life in our day. It is difficult perhaps\r\nfully to realise the changes since that time in other ways than growth.\r\nThe McGill of our day is not the McGill of seventy years ago, not merely\r\nin its accommodation and its advantages, but in its internal activities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _McGill College in_ 1855]\r\n\r\nUnder the original Statutes of the College the administration was under\r\nthe control of four distinct bodies: (1) The Corporation, which met\r\nannually on the day after commencement day \"to inspect the Books and\r\nAccounts of the Registrar, Bursar and Secretary and to transact all such\r\nbusiness relative to the property of the University as might be\r\nnecessary.\" This body seems to have taken no part in strictly Academic\r\ndiscussions. (2) The Board of Governors, which met quarterly in March,\r\nJune, September and December, and which was in supreme control; two\r\nconstituted a quorum and the Principal had a double or casting vote. (3)\r\nThe Caput, which met weekly and consisted of the Principal,\r\nVice-Principal and Professors, three forming a quorum. The duty of this\r\nbody was \"to frame Rules and Regulations for the discipline, lectures,\r\nstudies and internal government of the Lecturers, Scholars, Students,\r\nInferior Officers and other members of the College and to make\r\nregulations regarding the expenses and system of living within the\r\nCollege.\" They had no control at first, however, over studies or\r\nlecturers in the Faculty of Medicine. (4) The Convocation, which met\r\n\"four times in every Term for the purposes of conferring Degrees, such\r\nmeetings being regulated by the Caput.\" Every Professor, Lecturer and\r\nTutor had to take the oath of allegiance and of office.\r\n\r\nDiscipline was severe and was rigidly enforced. Every Professor was\r\ngiven power to punish students by confinement and fine, the fine not to\r\nexceed five shillings and the confinement not to exceed twelve hours.\r\nMany of the early regulations are of interest. The duties of the\r\nVice-Principal seem to have been responsible and arduous. All\r\ndisciplinary measures as well as the general conduct of the University\r\nwere under his direct supervision. He was compelled to reside in the\r\nCollege, and during the non-residence of the Principal he was to be \"the\r\nparent and guardian of the College Household.\" It was his duty \"to\r\nexamine students for matriculation, maintain the observance of the\r\nStatutes by Professors, Students, Inferior Officers and all other\r\nresident members of the College, enforcing such observance by\r\nadmonitions and punishments; to direct the students in their studies,\r\npromoting by all the means in his power their progress in Religion, and\r\nLearning; to preside over the Collegiate Exercises and regulate the\r\nInferior Officers and Servants of the College.\" At meals served in the\r\nCollege distinctive tables were provided, one for \"Members of\r\nConvocation and Bachelors of Civil Law, Lecturers, Fellows and Tutors\";\r\none for Bachelors of Arts and Students in Law and Medicine who had\r\ngraduated in Arts; and one or more for undergraduates. The academical\r\nyear consisted of three terms, the Michaelmas Term, the Lent Term and\r\nthe Easter Term, and it extended from the first Wednesday in September\r\nuntil the third Wednesday in June. The Arts course extended over three\r\nyears. Until a Chapel should be built it was imperative that Divine\r\nService should be held in some convenient room, and on the first and\r\nlast days of every term the Principal or one of the Professors,\r\nLecturers or Tutors selected by the Principal for the purpose, preached\r\na sermon in the College or in one of the Protestant churches of\r\nMontreal; attendance in full academic dress of all the members of the\r\nUniversity excepting those who had obtained a dispensation was\r\ncompulsory. The prayers in the College Chapel were said morning and\r\nevening; the service was conducted in rotation by Officers of the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nIt was required that \"the dress of all members of the University should\r\nbe plain, decent and comely without superfluous ornament.\" No member of\r\nthe Arts Faculty was allowed to appear in Church, Chapel, Lecture or\r\nDining-hall without his gown and only by special permission from the\r\nVice-Principal was a student permitted to go outside of the College\r\ngrounds without his academic dress. Students were not allowed to resort\r\nto any inn or tavern or place of public amusement without special\r\npermission from the Vice-Principal. They were not allowed to remain out\r\nof College nor to entertain visitors in their rooms after 10 o'clock at\r\nnight, and the Vice-Principal, Professors, Lecturers and Tutors had\r\nauthority to enter at all hours the rooms of undergraduates. Junior\r\nstudents were required \"to pay the respect due to their Seniors both in\r\npublic and in private by taking off their caps, giving place to them and\r\nby other useful modes of attention and civility.\"\r\n\r\nThe course of study leading to a degree in the Faculty of Arts was of\r\nthree years' duration. Courses were of two kinds, from which students\r\ncould make a choice. One consisted of Mathematics, Logic, and Ethics;\r\nthe other of Classics. In the former the First Year was devoted to the\r\nstudy of six books of Euclid, Algebra to the end of Quadratic Equations,\r\nand Trigonometry to the end of the solution of Plain Triangles. In the\r\nsecond year the course included a repetition of all the first year work,\r\nAnalytic Geometry, Differential and Integral Calculus, and Logic,\r\nconsisting of Fallacies, Induction and \"a sketch of a system of\r\nPhilosophy of the Human Mind.\" The work of the third or final year was\r\nin Physics, Astronomy, and Ethics, principally \"Butler's Analogy.\" In\r\nthe Classics course selections from Homer, Virgil, Euripides and Horace\r\nwere read in the first year; selections from Cicero, Horace, Demosthenes\r\nand Sophocles in the second year; and selections from Herodotus,\r\nÆschylus, Thucydides, and Tacitus in the third year. In the first and\r\nsecond years the students were \"exercised in Greek and Latin\r\nComposition, and they were also given a few lectures in Ancient History\r\nand Geography.\" In the third or final year they were exercised in\r\nEnglish Composition.\r\n\r\nConditions in the Medical School at that period have been described by\r\na contemporary, Dr. D. C. Maccallum, who graduated in 1850, when the\r\nMedical Classes were held in two rooms of the Arts building:\r\n\r\n\"A large proportion of the students,\" he said, \"were men verging on, or\r\nwho had passed, middle age. Indeed, several of them were married men and\r\nthe heads of families. There was sufficient of the youthful, however, to\r\nkeep things lively. 'Footing Suppers,' practical jokes, and special\r\ncountry excursions to secure material for practical anatomy, were of\r\nfrequent occurrence. The last, involving as it did a certain amount of\r\ndanger, commended itself particularly to the daring spirits of the\r\nclass, who were always ready to organise and lead an excursion having\r\nthat object in view. These excursions were not at all times successful,\r\nand the participators in them were sometimes thwarted in their attempts\r\nand had to beat a precipitate retreat to save themselves from serious\r\nthreatened injury. They contributed, moreover, to the unpopularity of\r\nthe medical student. 'Footing Suppers' were functions of the simplest\r\nand most unpretentious character. Each new matriculant was expected,\r\nalthough many failed to conform to the arrangement, to select an evening\r\non which to entertain his fellow students, the entertainment consisting\r\ngenerally in furnishing biscuits and beer--the old, time-endorsed 'cakes\r\nand ale.' In partaking of these, smoking, relating humorous stories,\r\nchaffing each other and singing rousing songs, the evening usually\r\npassed with much _bonhommie_. But sometimes they were rather boisterous,\r\nor, at least, noisy and exciting....\r\n\r\n\"Dissections and demonstrations were made only at stated times during\r\nthe morning and afternoon of the day. There evidently existed a marked\r\ndisinclination on the part of both demonstrator and student to work at\r\nnight in the highest story of a lonely building, far removed from other\r\ndwellings, imperfectly heated, and lighted by candles, the light being\r\nbarely sufficient to render the surrounding darkness visible. Having\r\noccupied for two seasons the position of Prosector to the Professor of\r\nAnatomy, I had to prepare, during the greater part of the session, the\r\ndissections of the parts which were to be the subject of the Professor's\r\nlecture on the following day. This necessitated my passing several\r\nhours, usually from nine to twelve o'clock at night, in the dismal,\r\nfoul-smelling dissecting room, my only company being several partially\r\ndissected subjects, and numerous rats which kept up a lively racket\r\ncoursing over and below the floor and within the walls of the room.\r\nTheir piercing and vicious shrieks as they fought together, the thumping\r\ncaused by their bodies coming into forcible contact with the floor and\r\nwalls, and the rattling produced by their rush over loose bones,\r\nfurnished a variety of sounds that would have been highly creditable to\r\nany old-fashioned haunted house. I must acknowledge that the eeriness of\r\nmy surroundings was such that I sometimes contemplated a retreat, and\r\nwas prevented from carrying it into effect only by a sense of duty and a\r\nkeen dislike to being chaffed by my fellow-students for having cowardly\r\ndeserted my work....\r\n\r\n\"The examinations for the degree of the University were conducted\r\norally, ten minutes being allowed to each examiner. The janitor,\r\nsupplied with a watch and a large bell, was placed in the hall outside\r\nthe door of the library, the room in which the examinations took place.\r\nAt the expiration of each ten minutes he rang the bell, and the\r\ncandidates went from one examiner to another. This was repeated until\r\nthe student had completed the round of examining professors. Immediately\r\non the termination of the examinations, the professors met and decided\r\nthen and there the fate of the candidates. The latter, in the meantime,\r\nwaited in the College in a rather painful state of suspense. They were\r\nsummoned separately before the Professors, and the result, favourable or\r\nunfavourable, was in each case made known to the individual....\r\n\r\n\"It was customary at this time for the student to be indentured to a\r\npracticing physician, or, if not so bound notarially, to make a private\r\narrangement with him to be allowed to study in his office and to be\r\nconsidered as his pupil. For this privilege a fee of £20 was usually\r\ndemanded. Apart from the éclat which was supposed to be attached to the\r\nposition of a student under a popular physician, and the belief of the\r\npossibility of the patron being able to forward the interests of his\r\npupils, there were, as a rule, few advantages derived from this\r\nassociation. It is true that in exceptional cases, if the physician had\r\na large clientele and took a warm interest in his students, he could, by\r\narranging their studies, occasionally examining them on the work done,\r\nand directing them in the routine of office work, be of material\r\nassistance to them. The office work of a physician in large practice,\r\nhowever, offered an excellent opportunity to acquire much practical\r\nknowledge. As, with few exceptions, physicians prescribed and dispensed\r\ntheir own medicines, the articled student had the opportunity of making\r\nup all the prescriptions. He compounded pills, a variety of which were\r\nalways kept prepared for use, and he made the different tinctures and\r\nointments. He had the privilege, also, of assisting at minor surgical\r\noperations, such as were performed in the office, of making physical\r\nexaminations, of applying tests; in short, office practice offered the\r\nsame facilities for acquiring practical knowledge, although in a minor\r\ndegree, that the outdoor practice of a hospital or the practice of a\r\ndispensary affords....\"\r\n\r\nThe recreations of students who dwelt in the College or its vicinity\r\nwere few and simple. There were no athletic teams or athletic games.\r\nIndeed, the number of students in Arts and Law was scarcely sufficient\r\nto permit the forming of athletic teams, and the medical students were\r\ntoo busy all day and were too far from the College grounds to take an\r\nactive part in college sports. There was no gymnasium and no physical\r\ninstruction. There were no fraternities other than the fraternity of\r\nMcGill itself. There was no Union, no Y. M. C. A. On evenings in spring\r\nand summer a military band usually played near the \"ornamental bridge\"\r\nover the stream in \"the hollow\" near the present Physics building.\r\nCitizens came up from the City to listen to the band, and before the\r\nEaster term ended students, too, enjoyed the music. The College grounds\r\nwere long used by citizens as a park. The students seemed to have had an\r\noccasional dance during the spring term, and at times there were\r\nreceptions in Professors' rooms to which students were invited. Later in\r\nthe \"fifties,\" after the coming of Principal Dawson, other forms of\r\nentertainment were added. Of these Dr. Dawson wrote: \"Evening gatherings\r\nat regular intervals during the session were arranged, and cards of\r\ninvitation for these were sent to the different classes or years in\r\nrotation. At such gatherings there was usually music, sometimes a short\r\nrecitation or address on some topic of interest, and scientific\r\ninstruments, specimens and photographs were shown, simple refreshments\r\nprovided, and every effort made to cause those who attended to feel\r\nthoroughly at home.\" Sometimes there were gatherings which took the form\r\nof what were known as \"conversaziones,\" during which conversation,\r\nsupposedly on literary or scientific subjects, but more frequently on\r\nless dignified topics, took the place of the dances of to-day.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, college life in the mid-century was characterised by a\r\nSpartan simplicity. The students of that period seemingly enjoyed its\r\nsomewhat humble joys and its unostentatious and frugal amusements. Life\r\nin that time was, at least, not artificial or luxurious or competitive\r\nor sectional; but whether the plain living of the period was more\r\nconducive to high thinking than the multifarious student activities of a\r\nlater day cannot here be answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM DAWSON AND THE MAKING OF MCGILL\r\n\r\n\r\nJames McGill made his will, providing for the founding of McGill\r\nCollege, on January 8th, 1811, two years before his death. He was\r\ndreaming of a great University which would rise at some distant but\r\ncertain day in the new land of his adoption. He was doubtless dreaming,\r\ntoo, of a strong personality who would guide the University to its\r\ndestined place in the country in which he had made his fortune and in\r\nwhich he had unbounded faith. At that very time another Scotchman,\r\ntwenty-two years of age, was dreaming in his home in Banffshire--also,\r\nby a strange coincidence, the home of James McGill's ancestors--of the\r\nland beyond the horizon from which tales of fortune and happiness came\r\ndrifting across the ocean. He was a Liberal in politics and a dissenter\r\nin religion. His independent spirit was revolting against conditions in\r\nhis own land. It was not easy to sever the ties which bound him to the\r\nold home and to venture alone into an unknown and far-off country. But\r\nthe new land was calling, and its lure was upon him. He resolved to go\r\nto Canada where he had heard that all things were possible to the\r\ncourageous and the industrious, and where men lived a man's life based\r\non merit and achievement, and unhampered by the fetters of worn-out\r\nfetishes and conventions. And so it happened that on the 8th of March,\r\n1811, exactly two months after James McGill had made his will, this\r\nyoung Scotchman set out for the new world. The ship in which he was to\r\ntake passage--a square-rigged, clipper sailing vessel in those steamless\r\ndays--was to clear from Greenock, one hundred and eighty miles from\r\nKeith, his Banffshire home. He had no money to spare to pay for a\r\nconveyance. He must cover the distance on foot. He sent his heavy\r\nluggage by carrier, and with a pack of necessary clothes and provisions\r\non his back, he set out with three adventurous but hopeful comrades on\r\nhis journey. He walked through the Grampians, by Kildrummy Castle, on\r\nthrough the town of Perth, along the base of Cairngorm in the Highlands,\r\nthrough the long valley of Glenavon, and thence to the sea-port town of\r\nGreenock from which the packet ships went weekly out into the mists,\r\nheading for the land of promise somewhere beyond the sky-line. He slept\r\nwith his companions on heather beds in front of peat fires in the homes\r\nof the Highlanders through whose villages they passed, and the Gaelic\r\ntongue of one of their number was always a charm sufficient to secure\r\nthem food. He reached Greenock on the 20th of March, but because of\r\nunforeseen delay it was not until April 11th that he embarked for\r\nCanada. After a voyage of five tempestuous weeks he landed in Pictou,\r\nNova Scotia, on May 19th, 1811, and there he determined to make his\r\nhome. The young Scotchman was James Dawson, whose son was destined in\r\n1855 to become Principal of McGill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Redpath Museum Photo Rice Studios\r\n_Sir William Dawson, C. M. G., M.A., L.L.D., F.R.S., Principal of McGill\r\nUniversity_ 1855-1893]\r\n\r\nIn his new home James Dawson soon prospered as a merchant and\r\nship-owner, and later as a publisher, and in a few years he was head\r\nof one of the most successful business firms in Eastern Nova Scotia. In\r\n1818 he married Mary Rankine, a Scotch girl from Lonerig, in the parish\r\nof Salamannan, who had emigrated to Nova Scotia after her parents' death\r\nwith her brother William, the only other member of her family. Like the\r\nother pioneers of that time, they, too, were resolved to make a new home\r\nand to restore their shattered fortunes in the new world. To James\r\nDawson and Mary Rankine two children were born, William and James, the\r\nlatter of whom died while still a boy.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dawson was born in the town of Pictou, Pictou County, Nova\r\nScotia, on October 13th, 1820, and there he received his early\r\nschooling. His parents believed in the value of education. Early in his\r\ncareer they determined that he should have whatever school privileges\r\nthe country provided, and that he should later receive a college\r\ntraining. Many years afterwards he wrote: \"To this day I cannot recall\r\nwithout deep emotion the remembrance of the sacrifices they made, and of\r\nthe anxieties they incurred to secure for me opportunities of\r\nimprovement.... I would specially record with gratitude that, at a time\r\nwhen he was in straitened circumstances, my father contributed liberally\r\nin aid of educational institutions then being established in Pictou,\r\nwith the view of securing their benefits for his sons, and that he and\r\nmy mother aided and stimulated our early tastes for literature and\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\nThe childhood influences that moulded William Dawson were typical of the\r\nhomes of the early Scottish pioneers in the Maritime Provinces of Canada\r\nat the beginning of the last century. They were characterised by\r\nsimplicity, by frugality and by reverence. They were founded on an\r\nunwavering belief in religion and education and honest labour as\r\nnecessary to the development of the individual and the nation. They were\r\nbased on principles inculcated in the youth of these early Canadian days\r\nlong before Carlyle with rugged pen and organ tone declared them. Later,\r\nwhen Principal of McGill, Dr. Dawson used to speak with affectionate\r\nremembrance of the agencies which fashioned him in the little seacoast\r\ntown of black wharves, and tossing tides, and far-come sailing ships\r\nbearing mysterious cargoes from unknown and romantic lands, and manned\r\nby strangely-garbed and bearded seamen speaking a foreign tongue. \"Our\r\nhome,\" he said, \"was a very quiet one except when strangers, especially\r\nmen engaged in missionary and benevolent enterprises, were occasionally\r\ninvited as guests. To some of these I was indebted for much information\r\nand guidance ... There was always much work and study in the winter\r\nevenings, and I remember with what pleasure I used to listen to my\r\nfather's reading, chiefly in history and biography, for the benefit of\r\nmy mother when busy with her needle, as well as of my brother and\r\nmyself, after our lessons were finished.... My early home had much in it\r\nto foster studies of nature, and both my parents encouraged such\r\npursuits. A somewhat wild garden, with many trees and shrubs, was full\r\nof objects of interest; within easy walking distance were rough\r\npastures, with second-growth woods, bogs, and swamps, rich in berries\r\nand flowers in their season, and inhabited by a great variety of birds\r\nand insects. Nothing pleased my father more than to take an early\r\nmorning hour, or rare holiday, and wander through such places with his\r\nboys, studying and collecting their treasures. The harbour of Pictou,\r\ntoo, with its narrow entrance from the sea, affords ample opportunities\r\nfor such investigations, and its waters teem with fish: from the gay\r\nstriped bass and lordly salmon to the ever-hungry smelt--the delight of\r\njuvenile anglers. In such a basin, visited every day by the ocean tides,\r\nthere is an endless variety of the humbler forms of aquatic life, and\r\nalong the streams entering it a wealth of curious animals and plants\r\nwith which an inquisitive boy could easily make himself familiar in his\r\nrambles and occasional angling expeditions.\" It was here that the\r\ninterest of the future scientist was first aroused in natural history.\r\nOf his mother he wrote: \"She was a woman of deep affections and many\r\nsorrows ... her girlish years had been saddened by the death of her\r\nparents, and by the mournful breaking up of her old home ... She had a\r\nfew warm and attached friends, and was very kind to such of the needy as\r\nshe could help.\"\r\n\r\nThe first scholastic training of William Dawson was received in a small\r\nprivate school in Pictou. From there he went to the recently founded\r\nGrammar School conducted on \"the good old-fashioned plan of long hours,\r\nhard lessons, no prizes, but some punishments.\" His parents desired that\r\nhe should study for the Church; he began his college career with that\r\nobject in view, but it was changed by circumstances. He entered Pictou\r\nAcademy, which had just been established primarily for the training of\r\nyoung men for the Christian ministry; it was presided over by the Rev.\r\nDr. Thomas MacCulloch, a Scottish teacher and preacher who exercised a\r\nlarge influence on the intellectual life of Nova Scotia. It was during\r\nhis course at the Academy that William Dawson first became interested\r\nscientifically in geology and natural history, subjects which were later\r\nto form so large a part of his life work. As a result he took long\r\nexcursions during vacations for the purpose of obtaining specimens and\r\nstudying the minerals of his native province. In 1840, he entered\r\nEdinburgh University, where he completed his course in 1847. It was in\r\none of his summer vacations in the Maritime Provinces that he first met\r\nSir Charles Lyell, the distinguished geologist, and Sir William Logan,\r\nwho later originated the Geological Survey of Canada. In 1847 he married\r\nMargaret Mercer of Edinburgh and with his wife he returned to Pictou.\r\nFor a time he gave a special course of extension lectures at Dalhousie\r\nCollege, Halifax. In 1850, Joseph Howe, for whom he had a deep\r\nadmiration, and with whom he had formed a friendship early in life,\r\noffered him the Superintendency of Education in Nova Scotia,--a newly\r\nestablished office. He accepted the post with many misgivings; and for\r\nthe next few years he devoted all his efforts to bettering the\r\neducational conditions of the Province, addressing school meetings\r\nthroughout the country and stimulating improvements.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 while he was still Superintendent of Education, his old friend,\r\nSir Charles Lyell, revisited Nova Scotia and the friendship formed a few\r\nyears before was renewed. On the same ship with him was Sir Edmund Head,\r\nthen Governor of New Brunswick, who, on this first meeting, was deeply\r\nimpressed by Mr. Dawson's views on educational reforms. As a result he\r\nappointed him the following year to the commission formed to report on\r\nthe re-organisation of the University of New Brunswick, which was then\r\nin a precarious state.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, the Governors of McGill, on the advice of Sir Edmund Head who\r\nwas about to become Governor-General of Canada in succession to Lord\r\nElgin, offered the Principalship to William Dawson. He accepted the post\r\nand began his duties in the autumn of 1855. The outlook of the\r\nUniversity when he arrived was not encouraging. The College buildings\r\nwere not used for classes, but part of them was occupied by professors\r\nand students; Medical classes were held in the Coté Street building;\r\nclasses in Arts and Law were held in part of the High School building.\r\nThe conditions of James McGill's will were not being carried out; there\r\nwas a College building on the Burnside Estate, it was true, but it was\r\nnot in operation.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless the call for educational opportunities was urgent. One\r\nhundred and ten students registered at the commencement of the session\r\nin all departments of the University, of whom fifteen were in Law,\r\nthirty-eight in Arts and fifty-seven in Medicine. The Faculty of Arts\r\nconsisted of five professors and one lecturer; the Faculty of Law had\r\none professor and two lecturers; and the Faculty of Medicine had nine\r\nprofessors. The annual calendar for the previous session, 1854-55,\r\nannounced that \"the board and lodging of students is a matter of much\r\npractical importance. From fifteen to twenty [Arts and Law students] may\r\nbe received by the Professors resident in the College buildings and\r\nprovision will be made when necessary for the reception of others into\r\nboarding houses, licensed by the Governors, upon settled economical\r\nterms and subject to proper rules of discipline and conduct.\" Medical\r\nstudents, it was pointed out, \"could obtain board and lodging in the\r\ntown for from eight to sixteen dollars a month.\" It was clear that the\r\nattendance would rapidly increase in succeeding years, and that\r\nprovision must at once be made for their accommodation and instruction.\r\nThe greatest hindrance to advancement was of course lack of funds.\r\n\r\nThe actual condition of the University at that time and the obstacles to\r\nbe overcome were afterwards frequently described by Sir William Dawson,\r\nwhose reminiscences of the period were always vivid:\r\n\r\n\"When I accepted the principalship of McGill,\" he said, \"I had not been\r\nin Montreal, and knew the college and the men connected with it only by\r\nreputation. I first saw it, in October, 1855. Materially, it was\r\nrepresented by two blocks of unfinished and partly ruinous buildings,\r\nstanding amid a wilderness of excavators' and masons' rubbish, overgrown\r\nwith weeds and bushes. The grounds were unfenced and were pastured at\r\nwill by herds of cattle, which not only cropped the grass, but browsed\r\non the shrubs, leaving unhurt only one great elm, which still stands as\r\nthe 'founder's tree,' and a few old oaks and butternut trees, most of\r\nwhich have had to give place to our new buildings. The only access from\r\nthe town was by a circuitous and ungraded cart track, almost impassable\r\nat night. The buildings had been abandoned by the new Board, and the\r\nclasses of the Faculty of Arts were held in the upper story of a brick\r\nbuilding in the town, the lower part of which was occupied by the High\r\nSchool. I had been promised a residence, and this, I found, was to be a\r\nportion of one of the detached buildings aforesaid, the present east\r\nwing. It had been very imperfectly finished, was destitute of nearly\r\nevery requisite of civilised life, and in front of it was a bank of\r\nrubbish and loose stones, with a swamp below, while the interior was in\r\nan indescribable state of dust and disrepair. Still, we felt that the\r\nGovernors had done the best they could in the circumstances, and we took\r\npossession as early as possible. As it was, however, we received many of\r\nthe citizens, who were so kind as to call on us, in the midst of all the\r\nconfusion of plastering, papering, painting, and cleaning. The residence\r\nwas only a type of our difficulties and discouragements, and a not very\r\nfavourable introduction to the work I had undertaken in Montreal....\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, I found in the Board of Governors a body of able and\r\nearnest men, aware of the difficulties they had to encounter, fully\r\nimpressed with the importance of the ends to be attained, and having\r\nsufficient culture and knowledge of the world to appreciate the best\r\nmeans for achieving their aims. They were greatly hampered by lack of\r\nmeans, but had that courage which enables risks to be run to secure\r\nimportant objects....\r\n\r\n\"Our great difficulty was lack of the sinews of war, and the seat of\r\nGovernment being, at the time, in Toronto, I was asked by the Governors\r\nto spend my first Christmas vacation in that city, with a view of\r\nsecuring some legislative aid. There was as yet no direct railway\r\ncommunication between Montreal and Toronto, and of course no Victoria\r\nBridge. I crossed the river in a canoe, amidst floating ice, and had to\r\ntravel by way of Albany, Niagara, and Hamilton. The weather was stormy,\r\nand the roads blocked with snow, so that the journey to Toronto\r\noccupied five days, giving me a shorter time there than I had\r\nanticipated. I received, however, a warm welcome from Sir Edmund Head,\r\nsaw most of the members of the Government, and obtained some information\r\nas to the Hon. Mr. Cartier's contemplated Superior Education Act--passed\r\nin the following year--which secured for the first time the status of\r\nthe preparatory schools, whilst giving aid to the universities. I was\r\nalso encouraged by Sir Edmund and Cartier to confer with the\r\nSuperintendent of Education and with the Governors of McGill on my\r\nreturn to Montreal, with reference to the establishment of a Normal\r\nSchool in connection with the University. This was successfully carried\r\nthrough in the following year.\"\r\n\r\nWith the loyal aid of the Board of Governors the Principal at once\r\nundertook to arouse the interest of the general public in the\r\nUniversity. He realised the necessity of securing their speedy\r\nco-operation and assistance. His belief was that the University should\r\nnot be isolated nor removed from the stream of national life; his hope\r\nwas that it should minister in a practical and tangible way to the\r\ncommunity in which it was situated. On November 5th, 1855, he was\r\ninaugurated as Principal. A few days later he established the first real\r\nlink between University and citizens, on the purely instructional side,\r\nby the commencement of a course of thirty popular lectures in Zoology,\r\nNatural Philosophy, Civil Engineering, Palæography and the Chemistry of\r\nLife. The fee for the course was £1. The course in Engineering was the\r\norigin of the department of Applied Science, which later expanded into a\r\nFaculty. Soon afterwards a course of lectures in Agriculture was given\r\nby the Principal, who, while Superintendent of Education in Nova Scotia,\r\nhad given several lectures on that subject throughout the province. The\r\nfee for this course was £1 5s.\r\n\r\nA direct appeal for financial assistance was then made to the citizens\r\nof Montreal. It met with an encouraging response, which greatly relieved\r\nthe situation and was what Dr. Dawson, forty years later, called \"the\r\nbeginning of a stream of liberality which has floated our University\r\nbarque up to the present date.\" But other anxieties were soon to be\r\nfelt. Early in 1856 the building occupied by the High School and the\r\nFaculty of Arts was destroyed by fire, together with the few books and\r\nthe scanty apparatus that had been collected or had been given by Dr.\r\nSkakel many years before, as well as many of the Principal's natural\r\nhistory specimens. Teaching was not interrupted, however, and during the\r\nremainder of the session, the classes in Arts were held again, in part,\r\nin the original College buildings, then undergoing repairs, and, in\r\npart, in the Medical Faculty's building on Coté Street, in which rooms\r\nwere generously placed at the disposal of the Faculty of Arts. Because\r\nof the occupation of part of the College buildings, and the expectation\r\nof soon again putting them to permanent use, improvements were commenced\r\non the College grounds, by the planting of trees and the making of roads\r\nand walks, the cost of which was borne largely by the Principal. In\r\n1856, general courses in Applied Science were established in connection\r\nwith the Faculty of Arts, and degrees were first conferred in that\r\ndepartment in 1859. The courses in the Law School, which had been\r\nformed into a separate Faculty in 1853, were extended to suit the\r\nconditions and needs of the country. But funds were necessary to meet\r\nthe heavy extra expenses incurred, and in order to provide sufficient\r\nmoney for the payment of debts and contingencies, it was thought prudent\r\nto sell a portion of the College lands. From 1858 to 1860, therefore,\r\nforty-four lots, averaging in size one hundred by one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet, were offered for sale by the University. Some of these were sold\r\nat auction. They were situated on Sherbrooke, Victoria, Mansfield and\r\nUniversity Streets. Money was also loaned by the College authorities to\r\npurchasers of lots to enable them to erect buildings. The temporary\r\nrevenue of the College was thus increased and expansion was consequently\r\nmade possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _William Molson, Esq.,_ 1793-1875\r\n_Founder of Molson Hall_]\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the number of students in Arts, Law and Science had increased\r\nto one hundred and five, of whom sixty were in Arts. It had been\r\npreviously decided that when the students in Arts should exceed fifty,\r\nthe original College buildings should again be wholly occupied. They had\r\nmeanwhile undergone extensive repairs. The College grounds were now\r\ntaking on some semblance of order as a result of trees and walks and\r\nclearings. Accordingly, in the autumn of 1860 the classes in Arts,\r\nScience and Law were moved back to the buildings which had been\r\npractically abandoned eight years before. The centre building was used\r\nfor classes; the east wing was given up to rooms for the Principal and\r\nsome of the professors and students. The erection of a third building,\r\ncorresponding with the east wing, was then undertaken through the\r\ngenerosity of William Molson. It provided for a convocation hall\r\nabove, and a library below. It was formally opened in 1862, and is known\r\nas the William Molson Hall. Through the efforts of Mrs. Molson the three\r\nbuildings were soon afterwards connected into one, by intervening\r\nstructures, and the Arts building as we know it was completed. One of\r\nthe connecting structures was used first as a museum; the other as a\r\nChemical and Natural Science room and laboratory. The museum received at\r\nonce a portion of the Principal's own collection of specimens, and\r\nothers purchased by the Principal from his own resources. Later Dr.\r\nCarpenter's valuable collection of shells was added, and the whole\r\nfurnished the nucleus for the present Peter Redpath Museum. The Science\r\nroom and laboratory were used for chemistry and assaying. It was there,\r\nin small rooms and with but scanty equipment, that Dr. Harrington later\r\nlaid the foundations for the departments of Chemistry and Mining which\r\nwere subsequently to contribute so largely to the industrial development\r\nof Canada. The Library in Molson Hall had room for twenty thousand\r\nvolumes, but when it was opened the College possessed only two thousand\r\nbooks. These, however, formed the nucleus for the Peter Redpath Library.\r\n\r\nDuring the following years the expansion of the University was steady.\r\nIt is unnecessary here to describe its growth in detail and only\r\noutstanding additions to its equipment can be mentioned. The deeper\r\ninterest of graduates in their University was manifested in the\r\nformation of a Graduates' Society by a small number of McGill men\r\nresident in Montreal. Greater co-operation with the smaller colleges in\r\nthe Province was effected, and St. Francis College, Richmond, and\r\nMorrin College, Quebec, were affiliated with the University. Theological\r\nschools established by the various Protestant denominations were erected\r\nin the shadow of the University and were granted affiliation. The\r\nCongregational College was affiliated in 1865; it was followed by the\r\nPresbyterian College in 1873, the Wesleyan College in 1876, and the\r\nDiocesan College in 1880. Speaking of the connection of the Theological\r\nColleges with McGill, Principal Dawson said: \"The value of these to the\r\nUniversity no one can doubt. They not only add to the number of our\r\nstudents in Arts, but to their character and standing, and they enable\r\nthe University to offer a high academical training to the candidates for\r\nthe Christian ministry in four leading denominations.\"\r\n\r\nThe growth and development of the University was made possible only by\r\nthe generosity of its graduates and friends. In 1871 a second appeal was\r\nmade for funds, and the result was a large increase in endowments, and\r\nin revenue. Several chairs were established and scholarships and\r\nexhibitions were provided. It was in this year that the first attempt\r\nwas made to offer facilities for the higher education of women, not yet,\r\nhowever, within the University, but unofficially connected with it. But\r\nthis movement must be left to another chapter.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Medical Faculty which had carried on its work for\r\ntwenty years in the Coté Street building required more accommodation and\r\na closer connection with the University. Funds for its adequate\r\nequipment were not available. Indeed, ten years later Principal Dawson\r\nwrote: \"It is somewhat singular that this school so ably conducted and\r\nso useful, has drawn to itself so little of the munificence of\r\nbenefactors. Perhaps the fact of its self-supporting and independent\r\ncharacter has led to this.\" It was decided, however, to undertake the\r\nconstruction of a Medical Building on the College property. In 1872 the\r\nfront block of what was afterwards known as \"the old Medical Building\"\r\nwas erected for the Medical School, and the Medical Faculty returned,\r\nthis time permanently, to the College grounds. Funds for its endowment\r\nwere afterwards given by its friends. The year 1872 is a notable one in\r\nthe history of the McGill Medical School, for another reason than the\r\nerection of its first McGill building,--it was also the year of the\r\ngraduation of William Osler, destined later to exercise so great an\r\ninfluence on medical education in Canada, America, and Europe. The\r\ndepartment of Applied Science which had been connected with the Faculty\r\nof Arts since 1856 was expanded into a separate Faculty in 1878. It had\r\nbeen temporarily suspended because of a lack of funds in 1870; it was\r\nnow re-created, greater than before. But it had yet no building and no\r\nadequate equipment. These, however, were to come in due course.\r\n\r\nSpeaking later of the decade between 1870 and 1880, Principal Dawson\r\nreferred to it as the middle period in his connection with McGill, \"a\r\nperiod of routine and uniformity, succeeding the period of preparation\r\nand active exertion and preceding the period of culmination. During\r\nthese ten years,\" he said, \"the University outlived for the most part\r\nits earlier trials and struggles. Its revenues expanded considerably....\r\nThe number of its students greatly increased, as did also its staff of\r\ninstructors. Gold medals and scholarships were founded. The beginning\r\nof a museum was formed, and the library, although still small, was\r\ngrowing rapidly, by donations and occasional purchases. A suitable\r\nbuilding on the College grounds was provided for the Medical Faculty. A\r\nnew Faculty of Applied Science was active and prosperous, though as yet\r\nwithout any building of its own. The statutes and regulations had become\r\nfixed and settled, and the whole machinery of the institution was moving\r\nsmoothly and regularly. It had, in short, reached a position in which it\r\ncould challenge comparison with its sister institutions and rivals and\r\nwhich to many seemed adequate to all the requirements of the time.\r\nStill, there were many wants unsupplied, and constant difficulty was\r\nexperienced in meeting the demands made upon us, from our limited\r\nresources, whilst many promising fields of usefulness had to remain\r\nuncultivated.... On the whole, the ten years had been characterised by\r\nsteady, if slow, advance, achieved by much toil and many sacrifices.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Principal was not yet satisfied with the University's service to\r\nthe community. \"It has been a matter of sorrow to me,\" he said, \"that we\r\nhave been able to do so little, directly, for the education of the\r\nworking class and of the citizens generally, more especially in\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Peter Redpath_\r\n\r\n_Founder of the Redpath Library and the Redpath Museum_]\r\n\r\nThe final period of Principal Dawson's connection with McGill, from 1880\r\nto his retirement in 1893, saw a further growth in the University. Into\r\nthe details of that growth we cannot here enter. The University was now\r\nbecoming a national rather than a local institution; it was contributing\r\nmore and more to national development. The Principal wrote, \"we\r\nshould not regard McGill merely as an institution for Montreal or for\r\nthe Province of Quebec but for the whole of Canada.\" Its expansion was\r\nfortunately in keeping with this ideal. In 1881 the erection of a museum\r\nwas undertaken through the generosity of Peter Redpath, and in 1882 the\r\nPeter Redpath Museum was formally opened. In the former year, too,\r\nanother appeal was made to the citizens of Montreal for funds to relieve\r\nits now straitened circumstances, and again the response was generous\r\nand encouraging. In 1882 Principal Dawson said in his annual University\r\nLecture: \"In these thirty years, [since 1852 when the amended Charter\r\nwas obtained] the College revenues have grown from a few hundred dollars\r\nto about $40,000 per annum, without reckoning the fees in professional\r\nFaculties and the income of the more recent benefactions. Its staff has\r\nincreased from the original eight instructing officers to thirty-nine.\r\nThe number of students has increased to 415 actually attending college\r\nclasses, or reckoning those of the Normal School and of affiliated\r\ncolleges in Arts, to nearly 600. Its Faculties of Law and Applied\r\nScience have been added to those of Arts and Medicine. It has two\r\naffiliated Colleges in Arts and four in Theology, and has under its\r\nmanagement the Provincial Protestant Normal School. Its buildings, like\r\nitself, have been growing by a process of accretion, and the latest,\r\nthat in which we are now assembled, [the Peter Redpath Museum], is far\r\nin advance of all the others, and a presage of the college buildings of\r\nthe future. We have five chairs endowed by private benefactors, fourteen\r\nendowed scholarships and exhibitions, besides others of a temporary\r\nnature, and eight endowed gold medals. More than this, we have sent out\r\nabout 1,200 graduates, of whom more than a thousand are occupying\r\npositions of usefulness and honour in this country.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sir William Macdonald_]\r\n\r\nThis final period of Principal Dawson's work saw a sure and steady\r\nadvancement and many changes in the University. Among the evidences of\r\ngrowth were the establishment of courses for women in 1884, with their\r\nextension in 1886; the addition of the Medical Building in 1886, and its\r\nstill further enlargement in 1893; the endowment of several chairs; the\r\nincrease in the teaching staff; the establishment of scholarships and\r\nexhibitions; the creation of new courses, and the plans for new and\r\nmuch-needed buildings. In 1886 the Vice-Principal, the Rev. Dr. Leach,\r\nretired after over forty years of service. He was succeeded as\r\nVice-Principal by Dr. Alexander Johnson, Professor of Mathematics.\r\nTowards the close of this period the Faculty of Applied Science, which\r\nhad been established as a separate school in 1878, was placed, at last,\r\non an independent foundation--after its many trials and struggles--by\r\nthe munificent gifts of Thomas Workman and William C. Macdonald,\r\nafterwards Sir William Macdonald, a native of Prince Edward Island.\r\nPreparations were made for the erection of Science buildings with\r\nadequate equipment and endowment. In February, 1893, a few months before\r\nSir William Dawson's resignation of the Principalship, two buildings for\r\nthe Faculty of Applied Science were opened--the Macdonald Engineering\r\nBuilding, including the Workman wing, and the Macdonald Physics\r\nBuilding, the equipment and facilities of which soon afterwards enabled\r\nProfessor Ernest Rutherford to carry on his experiments in\r\nradioactivity. Meanwhile the Library in Molson Hall had become totally\r\ninadequate for the volumes and documents that had been gathered by the\r\nUniversity. Peter Redpath, who had already given the Museum, was now the\r\nSenior Governor of the University. On November 12, he wrote to the\r\nChancellor enclosing plans of a projected library and proposing to\r\ncommence building operations early in the following spring. The building\r\nwas practically completed before Sir William Dawson's retirement, but it\r\nwas not formally opened until October, 1893. In the last four years of\r\nthe Principalship of Dr. Dawson the University was given more than a\r\nmillion and a half of dollars for endowment and equipment. What\r\ngratified him most in receiving this amount was the fact that it\r\nincluded many minor gifts which testified, at the close of his long\r\ncareer, to the good will and confidence and co-operation of the general\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Sir William Dawson's constant anxieties and strenuous\r\nlabours, his health had been for some time in a precarious state. In his\r\nannual University Lecture ten years before, he had said, \"My connection\r\nwith this University for the past twenty-eight years has been fraught\r\nwith that happiness which results from the consciousness of effort in a\r\nworthy cause, and from association with such noble and self-sacrificing\r\nmen as those who have built up McGill College. But it has been filled\r\nwith anxieties and cares and with continuous and almost unremitting\r\nlabour on the details of which I need not now dwell.\" Ten years had\r\npassed since then, and the \"anxieties and cares and unremitting labour\"\r\nto which he referred had not grown less. They had finally broken his\r\nalready weakened strength. On the 26th of May, 1893, after thirty-eight\r\nyears of arduous service, he tendered his resignation of the\r\nPrincipalship of McGill to the Board of Governors, and reluctantly it\r\nwas accepted. After his retirement his interest in the University did\r\nnot diminish. He continued his researches and his writings. There was a\r\nlast visit to England in the summer of 1896, to attend meetings of the\r\nEvangelical Alliance, the Royal Society, the Victoria Institute, the\r\nGeological Society, and the British Association, at the latter of which\r\nhe illustrated to a large meeting of eminent geologists the structure of\r\n_Eozoon_. In the summer of 1897 he was stricken with partial paralysis\r\nfrom which he recovered somewhat, but which left him an invalid. Two\r\nyears later, in the autumn of 1899, his illness became acute. He lapsed\r\ninto partial unconsciousness. For several days he lingered. Then on\r\nNovember 19th, a gray Sunday morning, very quietly at the last, he\r\nslipped away. The next day, the Governors, Principal, members of the\r\nteaching staff, and students gathered in the Molson Hall to do honour in\r\na Memorial Service, to the memory of the teacher, the administrator and\r\nthe man they admired and loved. The Memorial Address, here included in\r\nthe Appendix, was given by his successor, Principal Peterson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sir William Peterson\r\nPrincipal of McGill University_ 1895-1919]\r\n\r\nSir William Dawson was Principal of McGill for thirty-eight years, more\r\nthan a third of the century that has passed since the establishment of\r\nthe University, and almost half of the period since its actual opening.\r\nIt has not been possible here to speak of his researches, his writings,\r\nhis connection with learned societies. Many honours came to him from\r\nBritain, from America, and from Canada. He was the first President of\r\nthe Royal Society of Canada; he was President at various times of the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, of the American\r\nGeological Association, and of the British Association. In 1884 he was\r\nknighted. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he received\r\nhonorary degrees from Edinburgh,--his old University, from McGill and\r\nfrom Columbia. But all his activities were incidental and subservient to\r\nhis work as Principal of McGill and to his efforts for the advancement\r\nof the University. He saw the institution grow slowly but surely under\r\nhis guidance, in the face of many discouragements, from very small\r\nbeginnings to a foremost place among the great seats of learning of\r\nAmerica and Europe. He found in 1855 a college struggling under debt,\r\nwith inadequate revenue, with abandoned buildings, with few professors\r\nand with only one hundred students. In the last session of his\r\nPrincipalship more than a thousand students were in attendance, of whom\r\nthree hundred and fifty were in the Faculty of Arts, and one hundred and\r\nthirty-five degrees were conferred; more than half a dozen spacious\r\ncollege buildings had been added to the original structure; the lower\r\ncampus or yard was practically what it is to-day except for the new\r\nMedical Building; the endowments had increased to over a million and a\r\nhalf of dollars, the yearly income to nearly a quarter of a million and\r\nthe disbursements to nearly two hundred thousand dollars. The growth of\r\nthe University in equipment, in instructors, in courses and in general\r\neducational opportunities has already been indicated. In bringing about\r\nthis marvellous growth, the Principal had the generous assistance and\r\nsympathetic encouragement of a loyal band of friends, among whom his\r\ngreatest gratitude was recorded to William Molson, John H. R. Molson,\r\nPeter Redpath, Sir Donald Smith, afterwards Lord Strathcona; Thomas\r\nWorkman, and William C. Macdonald. Without their aid and their generous\r\ngifts the expansion of the University, needless to say, would not have\r\nbeen possible.\r\n\r\nBut greater perhaps than the material and numerical growth which he\r\naccomplished, was the spirit of service William Dawson brought to\r\nMcGill, and the influence of that spirit on the men and women who went\r\nout from the University to help in the development of Canada. It is\r\ndifficult briefly and adequately here to outline the ideals which shaped\r\nhis policy in guiding the University and the students over whose\r\ninstruction he presided. They are found in his addresses on various\r\noccasions. Perhaps they are best summed up in his farewell message to\r\nthe students in December, 1893, when he was leaving the University to\r\npass a few months in the South in a vain effort to restore his already\r\nshattered health:\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped, in the present session,\" he said, \"to be among you as\r\nusual, doing what I could, officially and personally for your welfare,\r\nbut was suddenly stricken down by a dangerous illness. In this, I\r\nrecognised the hand of my Heavenly Father, doing all things for the\r\nbest, and warning me that my years of active usefulness are approaching\r\ntheir close, and that it is time to put off my armour and assume the\r\npeaceful garb of age, in which perhaps I may yet be spared to be of some\r\nservice in the world.\r\n\r\n\"For the time being, I must be separated from the work that has always\r\nbeen to me a pleasure, and you will excuse me for addressing to you a\r\nfew words, on topics which seem to me of highest moment to you as\r\nstudents. I may group these under the word 'Loyalty,' a word which we\r\nborrow, with many others, from the French, though we have the synonym\r\n'leal,' which if not indigenous, has at least been fully naturalised\r\nboth in English and Scottish. These words are directly associated with\r\nthe idea of law and obligation, and with the trite, though true, adage,\r\nthat we who would command must first learn to obey.\r\n\r\n\"I need scarcely remind you of that loyalty which we owe to the\r\nsovereign lady the Queen, and to the great Empire over which she rules.\r\nI have had frequent occasion to note the fact, that this sentiment is\r\nstrong in the rising generation of Canadians, and nowhere more so than\r\nin McGill. It is indeed not merely a sentiment, though, even in a time\r\nwhich boasts of being practical and utilitarian, the feelings of the\r\nheart count for something: it is based also on the rational appreciation\r\nof the benefits of a rule, which, while allowing the greatest freedom of\r\nindividual action, secures equal rights and protection for all.\r\n\r\n\"We are, every one of us I hope, loyal to our University, and _to the\r\nUniversity as a whole_, not merely to any particular faculty of it.\r\nMcGill has endeavoured, more than most universities, carefully to adapt\r\nits teaching to the actual wants and needs of the student, whether in\r\nthe matter of that general academical learning which makes the educated\r\nman, or of that special training which fits the graduate for taking his\r\nplace, creditably, in the highest walks of professional life. To this, I\r\nthink, its success has been largely due. Yet, with all the breadth and\r\nthe elasticity of our system, we cannot perfectly meet every case, and\r\nthere are still desiderata, the want of which is most deeply felt by\r\nthose engaged in the management of the University. Our course, however,\r\nhas been onward and upward, and it may be truly said that no session has\r\npassed in which something has not been added to our means of usefulness.\r\nThe future, indeed, has endless possibilities, and there will be ample\r\nscope for improvement--and perhaps also for occasional complaints--when\r\nthe youngest students of to-day have grown to be grey-haired seniors.\r\nYou have good cause, notwithstanding, to be proud of your University,\r\nand to cherish feelings of affection and gratitude to the wise and good\r\nmen, who, amid many difficulties, have brought it to its present\r\nposition, and are still urging it onward.\r\n\r\n\"You should be loyal to the ideal of the student. You are a chosen and\r\nspecial band of men and women, selected out of the mass, to attain to a\r\nhigher standing than your fellows, in those acquirements which make life\r\nnoble and useful. It is not for you to join in the follies of frivolous\r\npleasure-seekers, or to sacrifice the true culture of your minds and\r\nhearts to the mere pursuit of gain. Your aims are higher, and require\r\nisolation from the outer world, and self-denial, in the hope that what\r\nyou are now sowing and planting, will bear good fruit in all your future\r\nlives. Live up to this ideal, and bear in mind that self-control, and\r\nthe habits of mind which it implies, are of themselves worth more than\r\nall the sacrifices you make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _J. H. R. Molson_]\r\n\r\n\"Be loyal to the memories of home. I regret very much that McGill cannot\r\nat present offer to its students such temporary homes as college\r\nhalls could supply. The time for this is coming, I hope soon. But most\r\nof you have those at home who look on your residence here with\r\nsolicitude and longing, who will rejoice in your successes, and perhaps\r\nbe heartbroken should any evil befall you. It is customary to say that\r\nyoung people at college are removed from the restraints of home and its\r\ninfluences for good. But this need not be. To the truly loyal, absence\r\nshould make these influences more powerful, and the thought of those who\r\nare watching you with loving hearts, in distant homes, should be a\r\nstrong impelling motive in the students' life.\r\n\r\n\"Next to home is heaven, and let me now add, loyalty to Him who reigns\r\nthere, and to the Captain of our salvation made perfect through\r\nsuffering for us. Many of you, I know, are earnest Christians and\r\ngrowing in spiritual life, as you advance in learning. To those who are\r\nnot, let me say,--read, as a serious study, the life of Jesus Christ as\r\ngiven in the Gospels. Read it in the light of His own sayings, that 'He\r\ncame not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for\r\nmany,' and that 'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten\r\nSon, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal\r\nlife.' Read of His life as the Man of Sorrows, of His agony in\r\nGethsemane, of His death on the Cross, crushed not merely by physical\r\nagony, but by the weight of our iniquities--and you may then judge, if\r\nthere is any obligations so great as that under which we lie to Him, any\r\nloyal service so blessed as that of the Saviour. The gate may be strait,\r\nand we may have to leave some things outside, but it is held open\r\nlovingly by the pierced hand of our Redeemer, and it leads through a\r\nhappy and fruitful life to eternal joys--to that land which the Scottish\r\npoet, whose religious ideal was so much higher than his own life, or the\r\ncurrent theology of his time, calls the 'land o' the leal.' That happy\r\ncountry is near to me, but I hope separated from you by a long, useful\r\nand happy life; but let us all alike look forward to meeting beyond the\r\nRiver of Death, in that promised land where He reigns who said 'Him that\r\nconfesseth Me before men will I confess before My Father that is in\r\nHeaven.'\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime you remain here to pursue useful work; I go to seek\r\nrestored health elsewhere, and can only remember you in my prayers. Let\r\nus hope that when the winter is passed we may meet once more, and that I\r\nmay be able to congratulate you on well merited success, not merely in\r\nregard to the prizes and honours which few can obtain, but in that\r\nabiding education of the mind and heart, which McGill offers to all her\r\nstudious children without exception.\"\r\n\r\nOn his last convocation as Principal, on April 29, 1893, he said to the\r\ngraduating class: \"I may say, we have full confidence that you will\r\nsustain the honour of the University, and will regard the education you\r\nhave received as a sacred trust, of which you are the stewards, and\r\nwhich is to be used for the good of all, for the advancement of your\r\ncountry, and for the glory of God.\"\r\n\r\nThose who worked with him or who studied under him and who are best\r\nqualified to speak, tell that it was, after all, the noble humanity with\r\nwhich Dawson invested his teaching and his administration that gave\r\ngreatness to his occupancy of the Principalship. It was his\r\npersonality, his energy, his deep and vivid sympathy with student\r\ninterests, even more than his learning and his contemporary influence in\r\nother spheres, that helped to re-create McGill. Under his spell there\r\nwere many undergraduates who had thoughts and aspirations beyond the\r\nMcGill of their day, thoughts of sacrifice, and of future service to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn forwarding his resignation to the Governors, he wrote: \"Much has been\r\nattained, but much still remains to be accomplished, especially with\r\nreference to the purely educational or academical faculty, which, in the\r\npresent stage of Canadian society, demands more than any other, generous\r\nsupport. Means for this have hitherto been deficient, and much precious\r\ntime and energy have been wasted in the inevitable struggle to maintain\r\nthe ground already gained. It has been my earnest prayer that I might be\r\npermitted to carry out in the case of McGill my ideal of a complete and\r\nsymmetrical university suited to this country, and particularly to the\r\nEnglish population of this Province. It has pleased God to deny me this\r\nsatisfaction; but I entertain the firm belief that good foundations have\r\nbeen laid, which will not be disturbed, but will be built on and carried\r\nto full completion, by the energy, care, and judgment of my immediate\r\nsuccessors.\" These hopes were destined to be fulfilled in the larger\r\nMcGill of our day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Dawson became Principal of McGill in 1855, there was no\r\nprovision in the University for the instruction of women. They were not\r\npermitted to attend the classes available to men. Indeed, women's\r\neducation was then under discussion and debate in Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States. It had many supporters but it had also many opponents.\r\nThe agitation for the higher education of women on equal terms with men,\r\nparticularly in the liberal arts, went back to the days of Defoe's\r\n\"Essay on Projects\" in which he included a section on \"an Academy for\r\nWomen.\" It had echoed from his time down through the eighteenth century\r\nuntil 1791 when Mary Wollstonecraft published her systematic treatise,\r\n\"A Vindication of the Rights of Women.\" Thereafter the original plea\r\nmerely for education became but a minor part of a larger demand for the\r\nfranchise and for general equality; and instead of a sober emphasis on\r\nthe necessity for learning, there was a somewhat hysterical clamour that\r\nwomen \"should be admitted side by side with men into all the offices of\r\npublic life with respect both to kind and degree.\" This agitation soon\r\ngathered abundant ridicule by the advocacy, led by Amelia Jenks Bloomer,\r\nof reform in women's dress, which would make it, as far as possible,\r\nthe same as that of man, and would consequently be an outward and\r\nvisible sign of the equality of the sexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dr. Alexander Johnson\r\nVice-Principal of McGill University_ 1886-1903]\r\n\r\nThe derision and scorn incurred by the movement because of the unwise\r\nzeal of some of its advocates had not yet passed in the fifties. In\r\nCanada, the question of higher education for women was avoided, or\r\nregarded with doubt or indifference. But Principal Dawson was an earnest\r\nand enthusiastic believer in women's education, and early in his\r\nconnection with McGill he formed plans for the providing of facilities\r\nto make such education possible in the University. Because of the\r\nindifference and the opposition to what was looked upon as a useless\r\ninnovation, these plans were slow in maturing and in actual\r\naccomplishment. The Principal, however, persevered; circumstances were\r\nfavourable, and in the end his hopes were fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn Montreal at that time there was a girls' school, presided over by\r\nHannah Willard Lyman, who later received an appointment to Vassar\r\nCollege. In this school no adequate course of instruction was given in\r\nNatural Science. Miss Lyman was desirous that her students should\r\nreceive some knowledge of that subject, and she asked permission to have\r\nher pupils listen to Dr. Dawson's lectures, which were given in the\r\nafternoons. Her request was granted and the school girls attended the\r\nlectures for one session. But the experiment, for some unexplained\r\nreason, was not satisfactory and it was not repeated.\r\n\r\nIn his annual University Lecture in the autumn of 1869, the Principal\r\nexpressed his belief in the benefits that might be conferred by the\r\nUniversity in providing means for women's education. \"I think,\" he said,\r\n\"it would be quite possible for the University to provide lectures on\r\nscientific and literary subjects, which would be open to all the ladies'\r\nschools in the city, and that certificates of attendance and examination\r\nmight be given to such pupils. I do not propose either that young women\r\nshould attend the ordinary College classes, or that except in special\r\ncases the ordinary professors should lecture to them. I should have\r\nspecial classrooms, and in many instances at least special lecturers\r\nappointed by the University. Of course, this is a purpose for which the\r\nconstitution of the University does not permit its funds to be used,\r\neven if they were sufficient for it--which they are not. I only wish to\r\nintimate my conviction that an opening for usefulness lies in this\r\ndirection--one which I have often wished to have the means of\r\ncultivating, knowing that in this country very few young women enjoy, to\r\na sufficient extent, the advantages of the higher kind of education; and\r\nthat the true civilisation of any people is quite as much to be measured\r\nby the culture of its women as by that of its men.\"\r\n\r\nA few months later, at a meeting of Governors and friends of the\r\nUniversity, held in February, 1870, preparatory to making an appeal for\r\nfunds to the citizens of Montreal, the following resolution was\r\nunanimously passed:\r\n\r\n\"That this meeting rejoices in the arrangements made in the mother\r\ncountry, and on this continent, to afford to young women the opportunity\r\nof a regular college course; and being persuaded of the vital importance\r\nof this matter to the cause of higher education, and to the well-being\r\nof the community, respectfully commends the subject to the consideration\r\nof the Corporation of the University, for such action as the expected\r\naddition to the endowment may enable them to take.\"\r\n\r\nBut no part of the funds which were contributed as a result of the\r\nappeal were specially assigned to the education of women. In December\r\nfollowing a reception was given in Molson Hall to the benefactors of the\r\nUniversity who had recently subscribed so generously to its revenue. At\r\nthis gathering, Chancellor Day referred to the necessity for providing\r\nthe means of furnishing a higher education for women, \"a matter,\" he\r\nsaid, \"in which we are wofully behind the age.... I trust the time is\r\nnot far distant when McGill College may become the privileged instrument\r\nof ministering to this urgent need. In this whole matter of education\r\nfor either sex, women are directly and deeply interested.\"\r\n\r\nA few months later, in 1871, Hannah Willard Lyman, the former Principal\r\nof the school for girls, died. Her former pupils in Montreal determined\r\nin some way to perpetuate her memory. They collected the \"Hannah Willard\r\nLyman Memorial Fund\" for the establishment of a scholarship or a prize\r\nfor women to be awarded in McGill when women would be admitted to its\r\nclasses, \"in a College for women affiliated to the University or in\r\nclasses approved by the University.\" But no way existed for the carrying\r\nout of this desire. The Governors showed little sympathy with the idea\r\nof admitting women students to men's classes; they had no objection to a\r\ndistinct women's College, but no funds for such an undertaking were\r\navailable. Dr. Dawson then appealed for help to the women friends of\r\nMcGill, and his appeal at once met with a ready response. In the autumn\r\nof 1871 a number of women interested in the higher education of their\r\nsex met at the residence of Mrs. John Molson, and formed the \"Ladies'\r\nEducational Association of Montreal,\" for the purpose of obtaining, in\r\nthe absence of University opportunities, instruction for its members.\r\nThis Association carried on its work for thirteen years, until women\r\nwere at last admitted to McGill. It was self-supporting, although it\r\nasked only very moderate fees from its students and paid its lecturers\r\ngenerously. Principal Dawson gave the introductory lecture of the first\r\nsession in October, 1871. The students who took the full course of\r\nlectures and passed an examination on the work received a certificate of\r\n\"Associate in Arts.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Percy Molson\r\nFounder of the Molson Stadium\r\nKilled in action July_, 1917]\r\n\r\nBut the hope of admitting women to the classes in Arts had not been\r\nabandoned. On October 25th, 1882, Professor Clark Murray moved at a\r\nmeeting of the Arts Faculty a resolution, which was carried, to the\r\neffect \"that the educational advantages of the Faculty of Arts should be\r\nthrown open to all persons without distinction of sex.\" In the summer of\r\n1884 a deputation of women who had already passed the examinations for\r\nAssociate in Arts waited on Principal Dawson and asked that\r\nopportunities be provided in the College to enable them to proceed to\r\nthe degree of Bachelor of Arts. The obstacle in the way of granting this\r\nrequest was the lack of funds. But a few weeks after the request was\r\nmade, Sir Donald Smith agreed to give a sum of $50,000 for the purpose,\r\non conditions to be settled by him. These conditions stipulated that the\r\nclasses for women were to be wholly separate and distinct from those for\r\nmen, and that no expenditure was to be incurred beyond the income of the\r\nendowment. The offer was accepted by the Board of Governors. The sum\r\ngiven was sufficient to provide the necessary duplicate courses for the\r\nfirst and second years in the Arts Faculty, and in the autumn of 1884\r\nthe first session for women in McGill commenced with fourteen regular\r\nand thirteen partial students. The women's classes were given in the\r\nlecture rooms of the east wing of the Arts Building. The students were\r\nknown as \"Donaldas,\" after the name of their generous benefactor, and\r\nthe course was known as the \"Donalda\" course.\r\n\r\nAfter two years had passed, in October, 1886, Sir Donald Smith increased\r\nhis endowment to $120,000 in order to provide sufficient income for\r\ncourses in all four years, and thereby to enable women students to\r\nproceed to the B.A. degree. In the session of 1886-87 there were twenty\r\nregular and fifty-eight partial students enrolled in women's courses,\r\nand in 1887-88 the number increased to twenty-six regular and eighty-two\r\npartial students. At the end of that session eight women received for\r\nthe first time the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Higher education for\r\nwomen in McGill was now an assured fact. The Principal's dream had at\r\nlast been realised.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Dawson had hope of a still greater development of women's\r\neducation. He said: \"This great work is not yet complete. We look\r\nforward to a College for women, either a College of the University\r\nco-ordinate with McGill College, or affiliated to the University. Such\r\nCollege while taking advantage of the Museum, Laboratories, Library, and\r\nother appliances of McGill College, and to a certain extent of its\r\nstaff, will have its own building, provided with all modern improvements\r\nand refinements for educational work.... I desire to express, as a\r\nmatter of personal experience, my entire sympathy with those who hold\r\nthat the education of women should be conducted, as far as possible, in\r\nseparate classes.\" The hope here expressed was again to be realised--and\r\nPrincipal Dawson lived to see the accomplishment of his plans. Sir\r\nDonald Smith, then Lord Strathcona, was again appealed to. He increased\r\nhis endowment fund for the erection and equipment of a building such as\r\nthe Principal had in view, and the building of the Royal Victoria\r\nCollege was begun in 1895. On September 4th, 1899, two months before Sir\r\nWilliam Dawson's death, the Royal Victoria College for women was opened,\r\nand the women students of McGill had at last a home and lecture-rooms of\r\ntheir own, \"provided,\" as Sir William had dreamed, \"with all modern\r\nimprovements and refinements for educational work.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lord Strathcona_]\r\n\r\nSince the opening of the Royal Victoria College the opportunities for\r\nthe education of women in the University have been greatly enlarged and\r\ndeveloped. To-day women students are enrolled on equal terms with men,\r\nnot only in the Faculty of Arts, but in the Faculties of Law and\r\nMedicine, and in the Departments of Commerce and Physical Education.\r\nIndeed, women students are admitted to all Faculties and Departments of\r\nthe University with the exception of the Faculty of Applied Science.\r\nWomen graduates of McGill have continued to go out for thirty-three\r\nyears to fill important posts and to take a prominent place in the\r\nbuilding up of Canada and in service to humanity. In the half-century\r\nthat has passed since the formation of the \"Women's Educational\r\nAssociation of Montreal,\" with its humble beginnings and its scanty\r\ncourses for \"Associates in Arts,\" the higher education of women has made\r\nundreamed of progress. In McGill it owes its guidance and its growth to\r\nthe tolerance in a time of prejudice, the determination in a period of\r\nopposition, and the patient faith in a day of discouragement, of Sir\r\nWilliam Dawson, who believed in the greatness of women's sphere and\r\ninfluence in his country and in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE LARGER MCGILL OF OUR DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing of the final epoch in McGill's first century, and the larger\r\nMcGill of our day, we must of necessity be brief. We are too close to\r\nthat epoch justly to judge its significance, or to give to the events\r\nand the incidents of which it is made up the fair and adequate reference\r\nwhich they doubtless deserve. Only the passing of the years can place\r\nthem in their true perspective. Any estimate of them in our day would\r\nperhaps be proved false by time. Matthew Arnold said: \"No man can trust\r\nhimself to speak of his own time and his own contemporaries with the\r\nsame sureness of judgment and the same proportion as of times and men\r\ngone by.\" The growth and development of McGill, then, during the last\r\nquarter of a century will be here given in bare outline only. The\r\ndetails of that growth are vivid in the memory of living men.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, Dr. William Peterson, Principal of University College,\r\nDundee, Scotland, was appointed to succeed Sir William Dawson as\r\nPrincipal of McGill University, and at the opening of the session in the\r\nfollowing September he arrived in Montreal to begin his work. The new\r\nPrincipal was born in Edinburgh in May, 1856. He received his education\r\nat the Edinburgh High School and at Edinburgh University, where he\r\ngraduated in 1875 with Honours in Classics. On his graduation he was\r\nawarded the Greek Travelling Fellowship, and after a period of study on\r\nthe continent he entered Oxford University for further post-graduate\r\ncourses in Classics. On leaving Oxford he was appointed Assistant to the\r\nProfessor of the Humanities in Edinburgh University. Two years later, in\r\n1882, he was appointed to the Principalship of University College,\r\nDundee, which included among its other duties the Professorship of\r\nClassics and Ancient History. Thirteen years later he became Principal\r\nof McGill.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four years during which Principal Peterson guided the\r\ndestinies of McGill were years of steady growth and development. They\r\nwere years, too, of notable and generous gifts from men of wealth and\r\nvision who believed in the value of education and of the beneficent\r\ninfluence of McGill in Canada and the world. Soon after Principal\r\nPeterson's appointment two projects for which his predecessor, Sir\r\nWilliam Dawson, had planned were carried to completion. Both of these\r\nwere made possible by the loyal aid of two benefactors who had already\r\ncontributed greatly to the expansion of the University. William C.\r\nMacdonald had already given the Macdonald Engineering Building and the\r\nMacdonald Physics Building for the advancement of Applied Science. He\r\nnow added to these the Macdonald Chemistry and Mining Building with full\r\nequipment for the carrying on of courses which, we have seen, Dr.\r\nHarrington had originated years before in the cramped and poorly\r\nfurnished rooms in the narrow corridor of the Arts Building. The\r\nbuilding was opened on December 20, 1898. The Faculty of Applied Science\r\nhad now passed from small beginnings and inadequate accommodation to a\r\ncomplete organization and a modern home. On September 4th, 1899, the\r\nRoyal Victoria College for women was formally opened. It was the gift of\r\nLord Strathcona, formerly Sir Donald Smith, who, in 1884, had made\r\npossible the establishment of the first courses for women given in\r\nMcGill, and who, in 1886, had made provision for the complete four\r\nyears' courses in Arts, the Donalda courses leading to the B.A. degree.\r\nThe former Principal, Sir William Dawson, lived to see realised the two\r\ndreams for the fulfilment of which he had worked so arduously--the\r\ncompletion of the Science Buildings and the erection of a women's\r\nCollege as part of the University.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dr. Charles E. Moyse\r\nVice-Principal of McGill University_\r\n1903-1920]\r\n\r\nOver the period that followed since the turn of the century we may pass\r\nbriefly. It was a period of continued development, not always, however,\r\nwithout its discouragements and problems which need not be here\r\nrecorded. But disappointments and obstacles were met by Dr. Peterson\r\nwith courage and energy and hope. The result was progress. The Medical\r\nFaculty, which had grown beyond its quarters, needed more room if it was\r\nto keep pace with modern research and with the increased number of its\r\nstudents. Lord Strathcona, who had given the first Medical endowment\r\nfund in 1882, again came to the rescue, and in September, 1901, a new\r\nwing to the Medical Building was opened. In October, 1904, the\r\nConservatorium of Music was established. Later, by the will of Sir\r\nWilliam Macdonald, it was left an endowment fund which placed it on an\r\nindependent basis and enabled it to be expanded into a Faculty of the\r\nUniversity. In 1903 Dr. Alexander Johnson, who had been\r\nVice-Principal for seventeen years, retired and was succeeded by Charles\r\nE. Moyse, Professor of English. In the spring of 1907 two disastrous\r\nfires occurred; in April, within eleven days of each other, the\r\nMacdonald Engineering Building and the largest part of the Medical\r\nBuilding were destroyed. Again the University's two great benefactors\r\ncame to its assistance. Sir William Macdonald replaced the Engineering\r\nBuilding with a new building which was opened on April 27th, 1909, and\r\nLord Strathcona provided for the erection of the new Medical Building,\r\nwhich was opened on June 5th, 1911.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sir William Macdonald had undertaken to provide in connection\r\nwith the University an institution intended to meet the needs of the\r\ncountry at large, particularly the rural districts, and to afford better\r\nfacilities for the training of teachers. With this object in view he\r\nfounded, in 1907, Macdonald College, at St. Anne de Bellevue, twenty\r\nmiles from Montreal. It was designed to include three schools, one for\r\nAgriculture, one for Household Science and one for Normal Training. The\r\ngift for buildings, grounds, consisting of nearly eight hundred acres,\r\nequipment and endowment amounted to over six million dollars. The\r\nCollege was incorporated in the University as the Faculty of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nThere were many other gifts from Sir William Macdonald during this\r\nperiod. In 1909 an attempt was made by a syndicate to purchase the block\r\nknown as the Joseph property at the southwest corner of the College yard\r\nor campus, for the purpose of building an hotel. The Principal was\r\nalarmed. He appealed to Sir William, whose pride was great in McGill\r\nand in the buildings he had erected. Sir William had no desire that the\r\ngrounds of McGill should become the backyard of an hotel, however\r\nexclusive. He at once purchased the corner, and presented it to the\r\nUniversity, thus completing the McGill square and providing a home for\r\nthe McCord National Museum. Two years later he purchased, as he said,\r\n\"for a playground for McGill students, the grown-up children of all\r\nCanada,\" the Frothingham, Molson and Law properties, consisting of\r\ntwenty-five acres, just east of the Royal Victoria Hospital and the\r\nMedical Building. This property, known as Macdonald Park, is the\r\nathletic centre of the University. In October, 1920, the Stadium in this\r\npark was formally opened. It was the gift of Percival Molson, B.A., who\r\ngraduated in Arts in 1901, and who was killed in action in front of\r\nAvion, near Lens, on July 3rd, 1917, while serving as a Captain in the\r\nPrincess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. The McGill Union, erected\r\non Sherbrooke Street, as a centre of student activities, was also the\r\ngift of Sir William Macdonald, McGill's greatest benefactor, whose\r\ndonations to the University during the Principalships of Sir William\r\nDawson and Sir William Peterson amounted to over twelve million and a\r\nhalf of dollars. In 1912 the four affiliated Theological Colleges formed\r\na co-operating Divinity School in affiliation with the University for\r\nthe instruction of joint classes, and Divinity Hall on University Street\r\nwas opened.\r\n\r\nThe last five years of Sir William Peterson's Principalship were the\r\nyears of war tragedy. When the war came in 1914 the University gave all\r\nits energy to the allied cause. When the trumpet blew for freedom, the\r\nPrincipal, although he could not actually enter the combatant lists,\r\ngave all his strength unstintingly. The part taken by McGill in the war\r\ncannot be here detailed; it must be left for another story. Only the\r\nbare outline need be mentioned. When the war cloud broke, the Canadian\r\nOfficers Training Corps already in connection with the University was\r\nreorganised, and grounds and buildings became centres of military\r\nactivity. In the spring of 1915 the McGill General Hospital, known later\r\nas No. 3 (McGill) went overseas. It was a distinctively McGill unit. It\r\nwas organised within the Medical Faculty. All its officers were members\r\nof the teaching staff or graduates of the Medical School. The nurses\r\nwere graduates of either the Royal Victoria Hospital or the Montreal\r\nGeneral Hospital, and practically all the men in the unit were drawn\r\nfrom the student body. Early in the following year a heavy artillery\r\nunit was organised within the University, and was permitted by the\r\nMilitia department to use the name McGill until its arrival in France.\r\nIt was also allowed to embody the McGill crest with the artillery badge.\r\nIt was organised as No. 6 (McGill) Siege Battery, but after its arrival\r\nat the front it was known as No. 7 Battery, Canadian Siege Artillery.\r\nThe Commanding Officer and the second in command were members of the\r\nteaching staff of the University; the other officers and\r\nnon-commissioned officers were largely graduates, and more than half the\r\ngunners were McGill students. Because of rapid promotions and consequent\r\ntransfers of officers and men, as well as of the usual circumstances and\r\nchanges of war, this unit lost before the end of hostilities its\r\ndistinctively McGill character. The majority of McGill men in the\r\noriginal unit received commissions. Five full companies of infantry and\r\npart of a sixth were recruited in the University. They were known as\r\n\"The University Companies,\" and were sent to the front as reinforcements\r\nfor the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. The majority of the\r\nofficers of these companies and a large number of the men were graduates\r\nor students of McGill. The 148th Battalion, Canadian Infantry, recruited\r\nin Montreal, although not under the authority of the University, was\r\naffiliated with the McGill Canadian Officers Training Corps, and a large\r\nnumber of its officers and men were members of that organization. Later,\r\ntwo reinforcement drafts were organized in the University and each\r\ncontained a large proportion of students. One was a heavy artillery\r\ndraft, which on arrival in England in the autumn of 1917 was absorbed\r\ninto the artillery pool and was used to supply new siege artillery\r\nbatteries about to be organised or to reinforce field and heavy\r\nbatteries already at the front. The other draft was recruited for the\r\nTank Battalion raised in the universities of Canada. But apart from the\r\nmen in the units and drafts organized in the University, McGill men,\r\nstudents, graduates and professors, were found in practically every\r\nbranch of the service, whether army or navy. The attendance of students\r\nin the University was reduced to a minimum; the teaching staff was\r\ndepleted. In all, over twenty-five hundred McGill men enlisted. Three\r\nhundred and forty-one were killed in action, or died of wounds or\r\ndisease; five hundred and twenty-two were wounded; three hundred and\r\neighty-two received decorations or honours, two of which were the\r\nVictoria Cross. In recognition of its services in the allied cause the\r\nUniversity received a grant of one million dollars from the Carnegie\r\nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching. McGill's war record, tragic\r\nbut glorious, is one of her proudest possessions.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Peterson's health had been impaired even before the war by the\r\ncares of an active and busy life spent unsparingly in the interests and\r\nthe advancement of the University. Like his predecessor, his life at\r\nMcGill was one of unremitting labour and ceaseless, strenuous tasks\r\nwhich drew in the end a heavy toll from his strength. Then the war came.\r\nWith its activities and the continuous demands it made upon his time and\r\nenergy, it severely taxed his already weakened constitution. During the\r\nsummer of 1918 he had been urged by his physicians and friends to rest\r\nbecause of his failing health. He did not heed the advice; he felt,\r\nindeed, that he could not in that troubled and anxious time obey it. He\r\nrefused to curtail his exertions, and he continued to give his great\r\nability and his unstinted service in every way to help the allied cause.\r\nOn Sunday, the 12th of January, 1919, although he was not then in good\r\nhealth, he presided at a meeting on behalf of a fund for the benefit of\r\nthe dependents of Scottish soldiers and sailors killed or disabled in\r\nthe war. While the meeting was in progress he was stricken with apoplexy\r\nand partial paralysis. In the course of a few weeks he recovered his\r\nspeech almost entirely, and later he regained the partial use of his\r\nright leg. When it became evident that he could not recover sufficiently\r\nto resume his place at the head of the University he resigned, and after\r\nMay 1st he ceased to be Principal of McGill. On July the 24th he sailed\r\nfrom Montreal for England, where he resided until his death in February,\r\n1921.\r\n\r\nSir William Peterson was Principal of McGill University for a period of\r\ntwenty-four years, one quarter of its century of life. During that time\r\nmany honours came to him. He occupied the presidency of many learned\r\nsocieties; he was knighted in 1915; he received honorary degrees from\r\nthe leading universities of Britain, America and Canada; he was Chairman\r\nof the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement\r\nof Teaching; he won great distinction as a scholar and a writer. It\r\nwould be unwise here to attempt to estimate the significance of his work\r\nas Principal of the University. We are perhaps too close to judge it\r\nwith correctness or with justice. The McGill he left in 1919 was not the\r\nMcGill he found in 1895. In the intervening years its development on the\r\nsure foundations that had already been laid was extraordinary and\r\nunprecedented for a university. Among the external evidences of growth\r\nduring that time are the McGill Union, the centre of student activities;\r\nthe Conservatorium of Music, with courses leading to the degree of\r\nBachelor and Doctor of Music; the establishment of a Department of\r\nDentistry, now grown to the stature of a Faculty; the acquisition of the\r\nJoseph property at the southwest corner of the Yard, and the new Molson\r\nand Law properties, consisting of 25 acres, the site of the Molson\r\nStadium, and of the gymnasium and student residences of the future; the\r\nnew Medical building; the establishment and development of the Graduate\r\nSchool, and of the Departments of Commerce, Social Service and Physical\r\nEducation, and above all, the addition of Macdonald College with its\r\nvast acres at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, where the work of the Faculty of\r\nAgriculture, Household Science and the training of teachers is carried\r\non. In these twenty-five years the number of students more than doubled.\r\nFinancially, too, there was a change. In 1895 endowments amounted to\r\nover a million and a half of dollars, in 1919 they were over twelve\r\nmillions, a sum to which the citizens' response to the appeal for funds\r\nin 1911 largely contributed; the income in 1895 was two hundred thousand\r\ndollars and the disbursements one hundred and eighty thousand; in 1919\r\nthe income and disbursements each amounted to approximately one million\r\ndollars. In addition to these visible evidences of progress many new and\r\nimproved courses were established; the teaching staff was greatly\r\nincreased, and the reputation of the University was enhanced at home and\r\nabroad. Externally and internally the newer and greater McGill bears\r\ntestimony to the energy and determination of Sir William Peterson during\r\nhis twenty-four years' occupancy of the Principalship. With the\r\ncriticisms of his administration--that as Principal Sir William was an\r\nImperialist first and afterwards a Canadian, and that in making\r\nprofessorial appointments he did not often consider Canadian scholars,\r\nwith at least equal qualifications--we are not here concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1919 Sir Auckland Geddes, Minister of National Service\r\nin the British Cabinet, and formerly Professor of Anatomy in McGill, was\r\nappointed Principal. He never assumed the duties of his office and a\r\nyear later he resigned to become British Ambassador at Washington,\r\nU. S. A.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1920, Sir Arthur Currie, formerly Commander of the Canadian\r\nCorps in France, was appointed Principal, and in the following August he\r\ntook up his new duties. In June of that year Vice-Principal Moyse\r\nresigned after forty-one years of service as Professor of English. He\r\nwas succeeded as Vice-Principal by Dr. Frank D. Adams, Dean of the\r\nFaculty of Applied Science.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new Principal was the making of a general\r\nappeal, with the Governors, in the autumn of 1920, for public\r\nsubscriptions to increase the endowment fund and revenues for the\r\npurpose of increasing professors' salaries and for the erection of new\r\nbuildings or extensions. The response to this appeal was generous; a sum\r\nof over six million dollars was subscribed, of which one million was\r\nfrom the Province of Quebec. The renewed interest of graduates in their\r\nUniversity was evidenced by the fact that they subscribed over half the\r\namount raised. As a result of the increased endowment, two structures\r\nwere at once undertaken, one an extension to the Library, and the other\r\na new building for the Medical Faculty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sir Arthur Currie\r\nPrincipal McGill University_ 1920]\r\n\r\nWith an encouraging interest in its welfare by graduates and by\r\ncitizens, with a large increase in students who last year numbered over\r\nthree thousand, with forward face looking hopefully to the future,\r\nMcGill University has rounded out its first century of life. The road\r\nover which it has passed, as we look back from the hilltop of to-day,\r\nhas been long and arduous. It has been beset with many trials and\r\ndifficulties. But the obstacles in the way of its advance were not\r\nunsurmountable; they were perhaps objects of discouragement, but never\r\nobjects of total despair to the men of stout heart and firm faith and\r\nfar-off vision who made McGill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dr. Frank D. Adams\r\nVice-Principal of McGill University_ 1920]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been written in these pages is based on authentic documents and\r\nsources rather than on tradition--on fact rather than on rumour.\r\nNecessity required that it should be the story of epochs rather than of\r\nindividuals. It is sometimes said unwisely that \"epochs are but\r\nresting-places or halts in history.\" But that is not a truthful\r\ndefinition when applied to the epochs of McGill, for they have all been\r\ntimes of progress. With steps sometimes accelerated, sometimes slow,\r\nsometimes even faltering, its movement has been always onward. There\r\nhave been no stopping-places in its life. It has not been possible here\r\nto give adequate notice or even reference to all its benefactors and to\r\nall the noble and unselfish men and women who helped in its advancement,\r\nto the distinguished graduates and sacrificing professors who brought\r\nhonour to its name, to the discoveries, the theories and doctrines for\r\nimprovement, whether intellectual or social or political, first\r\nfashioned in its shadow. Through the medium of these men and women, and\r\ntheir theories and doctrines carried into practice, it has won undying\r\nglory. Their names are safe in our University's past; we can leave their\r\nmemories in its keeping.\r\n\r\nWhen James McGill made his bequest he was dreaming of a University that\r\nwould first serve Canada and assist in its development. He himself had\r\nset his face westward. When he made his will he knew that he was of the\r\npast, but he had faith in the coming youth and manhood of his adopted\r\nland. He saw the possibilities of the vast new country in which he had\r\nprospered but which he was so soon to leave, and he had a firm belief in\r\nits future greatness. The Founder's dream has been realised even to a\r\ngreater extent than perhaps he hoped. The men who in its hundred years\r\nof life brought to McGill the largest portion of its fame, whether\r\ngraduates or professors, were products of the new country in the young\r\nmanhood of which he had such unbounded faith. They were, for the most\r\npart, native Canadians whose feet were rooted in the soil. They were men\r\nwhose ancestors, like the Founder himself, had crossed the ocean in\r\ncomfortless craft to face unknown hardships in forest and on plain, to\r\nbuild homes from the wilderness in which they might find happiness and\r\nfortune. Dawson in Education, Osler in Medicine, Laurier in\r\nStatesmanship, and a host of others, these are gone; they are behind us;\r\ntheir achievements are part of our century story. Elsewhere than in\r\nMcGill their services, their doctrines, and their theories have been\r\nassimilated; they have ministered to the nation's and the world's life.\r\nAnd the men and boys who went out from McGill to die for their\r\nprinciples during the world's five years of tragedy were similar to them\r\nin sacrifice and spirit; they contributed in another form to the\r\nadvancement of civilization. In their ideals they were typical of the\r\nCanadian youth of James McGill's vision. They justified the Founder's\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _McGill College in_ 1921]\r\n\r\nWith this reference to our great dead we bring these chapters to a\r\nclose. The next, unwritten, chapter in McGill University's history is\r\none of which we do not see the end. It must be left to other hands and\r\nother pens. When it is written it may or may not revolve about\r\nindividuals. Like its preceding chapters it, too, will more probably be\r\nthe story of an epoch. For while the individual must always vanish in\r\nhis due time, the College must survive. One fact is certain--after one\r\nhundred years of struggle and of ultimate triumph, life still beats\r\nstrongly in the veins of the University--more actively than in the days\r\nof its youth, and more hopefully than at any period in its history.\r\nThere is a new spirit in McGill. To-day its pulsing life, under the\r\nguidance of its great Canadian leader, reaches through all grades and\r\nfaculties and departments of its students as it has never done before.\r\nThere is a general forward movement, unhampered and undivided by\r\nconsiderations or competitions of sections or of faculties. The\r\nUniversity is closer, too, than it once was to the current of national\r\nfeeling. It is seeking to minister to Canada, the land which gave it\r\nbirth and from which its greatness sprang. But while it will serve\r\nCanada, it will continue to draw its students, like the true _Studium\r\nGenerale_, from every country on the globe, and to send them back to\r\nserve their individual countries to advance the enlightenment of the\r\nworld. McGill's first century has been a century of trial, but a century\r\nof great accomplishment. Its struggles and its triumphs are an\r\ninspiration for the coming days. If we but follow the ideals of the men\r\nwho made our University, with their noble sacrifice, their splendid\r\nachievement and their unwavering faith as our heritage, the unwritten\r\nstory of McGill's future will be more glorious even than the record of\r\nits past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE WILL OF HON.

(1852.)\r\n\r\nBy Her Majesty's command,\r\n\r\n(Signed)        EDMUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nTHE DAWSON MEMORIAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 20th, 1899, the day after Sir William Dawson's death, a\r\nMemorial Service, attended by Governors, Professors, and students, was\r\nheld in Molson Hall. Principal Peterson in his address said:\r\n\r\n\"Since we met in our various classrooms last week, a great and good life\r\nhas been brought to its appointed end. Sir William Dawson had\r\nconsiderably overpassed the span of life of which the Psalmist speaks:\r\nit was 'by reason of strength' that it was for him well-nigh fourscore\r\nyears. Ever since he assumed the Principalship in November, 1855--that\r\nis, for a period of exactly forty-four years--he has been the most\r\nprominent figure connected with this University. The last years of his\r\nlife--since 1893--have been spent, it is true, in retirement from active\r\nwork, but he has been with us in spirit all this time. Many of us know\r\nhow closely, and with what a fatherly interest, he has followed all our\r\nlater history. And now his life has closed, in great physical weakness,\r\nbut happily unaccompanied by distress or suffering:\r\n\r\n    \"'Of no distemper, of no blast he died,\r\n      But fell like autumn fruit that mellow'd long.'\r\n\r\n\"Busy, active and strenuous all his days, he must have chafed, I fancy,\r\nduring recent years under a growing sense of uselessness--almost an\r\nimpatience at being laid aside from work, which had been to him so long\r\nthe very breath of life; yet none ever said with more simple, childlike\r\nresignation, 'Thy way, not mine!' For such a painless passing out of\r\nlife, no vote of sorrow need be struck. There is no sting in a death\r\nlike his: the grave is not his conqueror. Rather has death been\r\nswallowed up in victory--the victory of a full and complete life, marked\r\nby earnest endeavour, untiring industry, continuous devotion and\r\nself-sacrifice, together with an abiding and ever-present sense of\r\ndependence on the will of Heaven. His work was done, to quote the\r\nPuritan poet's noble line: 'As ever in his great taskmaster's eye'; and\r\nnever for a moment did he waver in his feeling of personal\r\nresponsibility to a personal God. Others will speak to you of his\r\nrecord as a scientific man. I shall permit myself only to say that few\r\ncan have an adequate idea of the power and forcefulness revealed in the\r\nmere fact that one who had so onerous a part to play as a college head\r\nshould have been able to keep up scientific work at all. A weaker nature\r\nwould have exhausted itself in the problems of administration.\r\n\r\n\"He, himself, has left it on record, in his paper entitled,\r\n'Thirty-eight Years of McGill,' that these years were 'filled with\r\nanxieties and cares, and with continuous and almost unremitting labour.'\r\nThere are on my library table at the present time three volumes, in\r\nwhich three college presidents may be said to have summed up the\r\nlifework it has been given them to do for the institutions with which\r\nthey were severally connected--Caird of Glasgow, Eliot of Harvard, and\r\nGilman of Johns Hopkins. The first was a massive intellect which, in the\r\nsecurity of a long-established university system, delighted to deal, in\r\na series of addresses to the Glasgow students, with such subjects as the\r\nunity and progressiveness of the sciences, the study of history, the\r\nstudy of art, and the place in human development of Erasmus and Galileo,\r\nBacon, Hume and Bishop Butler. The two American Presidents have lived\r\nmore in the concrete, and they have put on record their attitude to, and\r\ntheir methods of dealing with, the various problems they have had to\r\nface in the educational world in which their work has been done.\r\nAlongside their memorial volumes I like to place a still more\r\nunpretending collection of 'Educational Papers,' which Sir William\r\nDawson circulated among his friends. They mark the various stages, full\r\nof struggle and stress at every point, of his college administration,\r\nand they form a record of what he was able to accomplish--apart from his\r\nwork as a geologist--in the sphere of education, for the High School and\r\nthe Normal School of this city, for the schools of the province, and\r\nabove all for McGill itself, which he found in 1855 a mere college with\r\neighty students, and which he raised to the level of a great university\r\nwith over a thousand.\r\n\r\n\"Not even in his well-earned retirement could he permit himself to be\r\nidle. To me, one of the most touching sights in the first year of my\r\narrival here, was the indomitable perseverance with which every day the\r\nwell-known figure of the old Principal would make its way, bag in hand,\r\nacross the campus to the museum he loved so well, there to work for a\r\ntime among the valuable collections which the University owes to his\r\nzeal, industry and devotion. It was in 1841 that he published his first\r\nscientific paper, and the activity which began then was continued down\r\nto the Thursday in the week before his death, when some reference to the\r\nmining industry of this country suggested to him that once more with\r\nfailing hand and wearied brain he should put pen to paper on the subject\r\nof the 'Gold of Ophir.' And now he has entered into his\r\nrest,--affectionately tended to the last by the gentle care of a devoted\r\nand heroic wife, and solaced by the presence of a distinguished son and\r\nloving daughter. The world had no power to hold him any more. His work\r\nwas done and his spirit yearned to pass beyond all earthly bounds.\r\n\r\n\"He is gone and we shall see his living face no more. But teachers and\r\nstudents alike may have ever with them the inspiration of his noble life\r\nand the stimulus of his high example. What he was to those who were so\r\nlong his colleagues I leave others on this occasion to set before us. My\r\nclosing words to the students of McGill must be the expression of a\r\nconfident hope that the record of Sir William's life and work will\r\nalways be an abiding memory in this place. If you will bear it about\r\nwith you in your hearts, not only will you be kept from lip service,\r\nslackness, half-heartedness in your daily duties,--and from the graver\r\nfaults of youth at which his noble soul would have revolted,--from\r\ndishonesty, sensuality and impurity in every form,--but you will be\r\nable, each in his sphere, to realise more fully the ideal of goodness\r\nand truth, so that at the last you, too, may hear the voices whispering\r\nas they have now spoken to him,--'Well done, thou good and faithful\r\nservant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\nTHE PETERSON MEMORIAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 16th, 1921, a University Service in Memory of Sir William\r\nPeterson was held in the Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul, of which Sir\r\nWilliam was a member and where he had worshipped during his twenty-four\r\nyears in Canada. The following memorial address was given by the Rev.\r\nPrincipal D. J. Fraser (Arts '93), D.D., LL.D., of the Presbyterian\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Peterson had a fine reverence for sacred things and a keen\r\nappreciation of church worship. In the absence of a college chapel,\r\nwhich leaves McGill still lacking one note of catholicity, it is fitting\r\nthat the Service to his memory, although a distinctively University\r\nService, should be held in this Church where he worshipped with both the\r\nunderstanding and the spirit during the twenty-four years of his life\r\namongst us. He had the Scot's proverbial taste for a good sermon, and he\r\nexacted that the pulpit should deal with Christianity as a rational\r\nreligion and should make its appeal to the intelligence of the people.\r\nKnowing as he did that the Bible is the foundation not only of\r\nindividual and national character but also of a comprehensive culture,\r\nand regretting that many children through home neglect had their only\r\nknowledge of it from the lessons heard in church, he pleaded that the\r\nScriptures be reverently and clearly read. He was one of our highest\r\nauthorities on hymnology and church music; he loved to join in singing\r\nthe familiar psalms and paraphrases and hymns, and he appreciated as few\r\nin the congregation could the majestic anthems rendered by the choir. He\r\nnever wantonly absented himself from the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper,\r\nthe Presbyterian ritual of which, in close keeping with the form of the\r\noriginal Holy Meal, naturally appealed to him. Intellectual and\r\nmystical, historical and sacramental elements entered into his worship.\r\n\r\n\"I think his last diet of public worship, except the one at which he was\r\nstricken, was a Memorial Service in this Church to those who would not\r\nreturn from overseas, when I gave the sermon on a text chosen from those\r\nimmortal verses of poetic beauty which have just been read by his\r\nsuccessor (Revelation 22:4-5). Those, however, who laid down their\r\nlives for the cause of Empire and Humanity do not all sleep in Flanders\r\nand in France. Although in delicate physical health, he threw himself\r\nwith abandon into the grim struggle from its very outset; he undertook\r\nthe work of colleagues who had enlisted; he carried in his heart a\r\ntender solicitude for the lads from McGill who were exposed to peril; he\r\nacted almost as confidential adviser to the Government's Department of\r\nMilitia; he advocated ceaselessly by voice and pen the cause so dear to\r\nhis patriotic soul, until he inevitably broke under the strain; and\r\nto-day we memorialise as bonnie a fighter and as genuine a hero as any\r\nwhose name is on our military Roll of Honour.\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Peterson was greatest as a scholar. It is hardly necessary\r\nthat I refer to his brilliant career as a classical student at Edinburgh\r\nand Oxford, his priceless legacy to scholarship in the works of the\r\nLatin authors he edited and translated, his successful administration of\r\nUniversity College, Dundee, at an extremely difficult time in its\r\nhistory, and his guidance of the affairs of McGill during its period of\r\nphenomenal growth from 1895 to 1919; for many of you who were his\r\ncolleagues are better qualified than I to estimate the value of these\r\nactivities. He preserved to the end the instincts and habits of the\r\nscholar. When he enjoyed a period of freedom from his administrative\r\nduties it was to the libraries of America and Europe that he gravitated\r\nin the scholar's quest for old documents that would yield the scholar's\r\njoy of new discovery; and on his last holiday visit to Scotland,\r\ndeprived by the war of access to the libraries of the Continent, he\r\nhappened upon an unpublished document of the seventeenth century by what\r\nhe modestly called 'a lucky chance.' We know, however, that these happy\r\nfinds come only to those who have the genius of the literary discoverer,\r\nand characteristic of the textual critic is his parting message to us in\r\nhis delightful description of his new-found treasure given in a magazine\r\narticle under the prophetic title--'A Last Will and Testament.'\r\n\r\n\"As an educationalist Sir William Peterson was a mediator between the\r\nchampions of pure learning and the advocates of the practical sciences.\r\nTo him the University had a two-fold function; first 'to make good\r\ncitizens,' and second 'to hand on the torch of knowledge to successive\r\ngenerations of students.' He believed that in order of teaching pure\r\nlearning should precede applied science, that classical subjects should\r\nprecede professional; but in spite of his Oxford training he could never\r\nbe accused of sacrificing the practical in the University to the\r\ndisciplinary. He recognised that the development of the pure sciences\r\nwas effected in history by the practical needs of life and that the\r\nmarvels of modern scientific activity are based on abstract and\r\ntheoretical learning. He found a place for the classical and the\r\nspecialised, the humanistic and the utilitarian, and his ideal was that\r\nthe University should give practical men a sound training in theory and\r\nalso keep theory in touch with practice. It was a blessing to McGill and\r\nto education in Canada that we had as our guide a believer in the\r\nhumanities at a time when our youthful enthusiasm for the practical was\r\nin danger of blinding us to the ideal of our educational ancestors that\r\nthe function of the school is to develop men and women of character.\r\n\r\n\"Principal Peterson was widely known as an ardent champion of\r\nImperialism, although here he failed to carry with him some of his\r\nwarmest Canadian friends; but it is not so generally known that he did a\r\ngreat and needed work on this Continent in the interests of Anglo-Saxon\r\nunity. He frequently visited the United States and gave addresses to\r\nuniversities, learned societies, Canadian clubs and similar influential\r\ngroups, and he always appealed for mutual good-will between the two\r\nchildren of the same British mother. In fact he earned a more generous\r\nrecognition there than in Canada or in Great Britain. Harvard and\r\nPrinceton, Yale and Johns Hopkins conferred their highest honour on the\r\nrepresentative of our national University, and acknowledged that it was\r\nnot a mere international compliment but a real recognition of a scholar\r\nwho had made lasting contributions to the cause of higher learning and\r\nhuman progress. He was also elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees of\r\nthe Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Holding an\r\nalmost unique place among the College Presidents on this Continent, his\r\nwords reached influential audiences and carried great weight. His first\r\nvisit to the United States was in 1896, during the first year of his\r\nincumbency at McGill for the purpose of addressing the Phi Beta Kappa\r\nAlumni of New York, and he chose for his theme 'The Relations of the\r\nEnglish-speaking Peoples.' It was the time of the Venezuela incident\r\nwhen there was imminent danger of misunderstanding between Britain and\r\nAmerica. His plea for friendship is of special interest to us to-day\r\nwhen there is a highly organised propaganda for stirring up strife\r\nbetween the two nations, a propaganda that is causing real anxiety to\r\nthe spiritual descendants of Britain in Canada and New England. In these\r\nchaotic days we do well to heed and herald his message on that occasion.\r\n'It is well-nigh inconceivable,' he said, 'that in this age of the\r\nworld's progress the two representatives of Anglo-Saxon civilization\r\nwill ever enter on a fratricidal struggle to decide which shall be the\r\ngreater.... The best guarantees for the continuance of mutual good-will\r\nare surely to be found in that of which I know we are all equally\r\nproud--community of race, language, literature, religion and\r\ninstitutions, together with the glorious traditions of a common\r\nhistory.... A racial federation between Britain and America would\r\nprobably prove a potent factor in hastening the era of general\r\ndisarmament.... The authority, more fortunate even than President\r\nMonroe, will lay impossible, and then it will be seen that every man who\r\nby rash action or hasty word makes the preservation of peace difficult\r\nhas committed a crime not only against his own country but against\r\ncivilization itself.' That last sentence obviously referred to President\r\nCleveland. I was a student at Harvard at the time and every Professor\r\nwhose classes I attended took the same attitude. By such appeals\r\nPrincipal Peterson helped to strengthen the body of American opinion\r\nthat exists to-day against the intolerable thought of strife between the\r\ntwo peoples who have lived for more than a century in peace and harmony\r\nand mutual affection, and his weighty words are a warning to Canadians\r\nwho share his imperialistic ideals against irresponsible criticisms of\r\nour friends and neighbours to the South. His Imperialism, while it gave\r\nhim the vision of a commonwealth of nations within the British\r\nPossessions, did not blind him to the larger vision of the unity of\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples, and to the still nobler vision of universal\r\nbrotherhood of which his fellow-countryman sang under conditions of\r\nunrest very similar to our own:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Then let us pray that come it may,\r\n    As come it will for a' that,\r\n    That man to man the warld o'er,\r\n    Shall brithers be for a' that.'\r\n\r\n\"While Dr. Peterson was primarily a scholar and administrator, he was\r\nalso a public-spirited citizen who mingled freely with his fellows in\r\nvaried walks of life and who identified himself with many movements in\r\nthe interests of human welfare. His last public address was to a group\r\nof our Greek fellow-citizens with whose propaganda against Turkish rule\r\nover their brethren in Asia Minor he rightly or wrongly sympathised. His\r\nchief public interest, however, was in education, and he not only served\r\ndiligently on the Council of Protestant Instruction for the Province of\r\nQuebec but he gladly gave the encouragement of his presence and counsel\r\nto the teachers in primary and secondary schools throughout Canada at\r\ntheir annual gatherings; and one of his favourite pleas on these\r\noccasions was for the rightful place of English Literature--and\r\nespecially Poetry--in the school curriculum. He magnified the office of\r\nthe teacher and deplored the apathy of the public towards those\r\nentrusted with the training of the future manhood and womanhood of the\r\nnation. 'No expenditure,' he cried, 'is considered too great to be\r\ngrudged on war and armaments by land and by sea, on construction works\r\nsuch as railways, bridges, harbours and naval stations, but the needs of\r\nthe common school rouse little, if any, interest or enthusiasm. And yet\r\nit is there that the national character is being moulded.' He never\r\nceased to protest against the narrow idea that education consists merely\r\nin the acquiring of knowledge and is to be measured by success in\r\nexaminations; and he constantly held up to the teachers of youth the\r\nneed of caring for such things as 'good manners, courtesy, consideration\r\nfor others, respect for seniors, friendly politeness towards all.' He\r\nwas also an enthusiastic supporter of the teaching of music in the\r\npublic schools. He saw what had been accomplished by training in this\r\ndepartment in Scotland and Germany, for example, among peoples not\r\nnaturally musical, and he feared that through our neglect we might\r\nbecome a songless race. Himself finding in music one of his exquisite\r\ndelights, he endeavoured to bring to the rural districts its elevating\r\nand enriching influence.\r\n\r\n\"Although not a social reformer in the popular sense of that term, he\r\nwas deeply interested in efforts for the betterment of the community;\r\nand especially in the last years of his active life the social situation\r\nin Montreal weighed heavily on his heart and conscience. He beheld the\r\ncity from his uptown coign of vantage and the vision troubled him. The\r\nsocial evils of this great commercial centre challenged him to do\r\nsomething for the alleviation of distress, the improvement of housing\r\nconditions, the prevention of such slums as are a blot on the fair city\r\nwhich gave him birth, the reduction of the infant mortality which is a\r\nscandal to our population and the bringing of the simple joys and\r\npleasures of life to the greatest possible number. He saw so many worthy\r\nseparate agencies trying to grapple with the social problem without\r\nunity of purpose and co-ordination of effort, he saw the churches so\r\nrelatively powerless to effect any appreciable cure because of their\r\nsectarian divisions, that he dreamed a dream that McGill University\r\nmight do in this respect what the existing agencies and churches were\r\nhelpless to effect, that it might become not only the inspirer of a\r\ngreat passion for social redemption and not merely a school for the\r\nscientific training of social workers, but also a unifying centre of our\r\nmanifold social efforts where existing agencies might be strengthened\r\nand stimulated and co-ordinated. This is really the thought that lay\r\nbehind his organizing the Department of Social Service in the\r\nUniversity. Whatever we may think of his method of ministering to the\r\ncrying social needs of our time and place, we cannot doubt the sincerity\r\nof his purpose and the intensity of his desire. It was also his\r\nsolicitude for the students coming up from the country and smaller towns\r\nto this populous centre, exposed to the moral perils of a great city,\r\nthat kept him strongly appealing for dormitories under University\r\nsupervision and control, an appeal to which we turned a strangely deaf\r\near, but to which, we are thankful to say, he lived long enough to see a\r\nfairly generous response.\r\n\r\n\"One hesitates to refer to the personal qualities that endeared him to\r\nhis intimate friends. I always detected in his life a certain undefined\r\nloneliness. The scholar's shyness and the isolation of his exalted\r\nposition hardly account for it. A humanistic scholar in a University\r\nwhere the practical departments were making greatest progress, engrossed\r\nin his intellectual interests in the solitude of his upper chamber while\r\nthe busy commercial world went heedless by, always leisurely in the\r\nmidst of a most active life, a man of religious reticence who was\r\nmisunderstood because he did not make a noisy profession of his faith,\r\nan old countryman in a new land that he never could quite call 'home,' a\r\ncontroversialist skilled only in the use of the rapier and compelled at\r\ntimes to enter the lists with those who wielded the bludgeon, a subtle\r\nhumourist who must 'carry on' with the prosaic and matter-of-fact, a\r\nlover of his own fireside who must of necessity be socially advertised\r\nwith the vulgar, his spirit dwelt apart from the busy world in which he\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n\"Loyalty was the supreme virtue in his ethical code, and disloyalty was\r\nto him the unpardonable sin. No man could have done for McGill what he\r\ndid and not make academic enemies. He found a group of professional\r\nschools, each more or less autonomous, and he transformed it into a\r\nUniversity. His ideal of the unity of learning made it necessary that he\r\nshould run counter to the traditions of the various schools in seeking\r\nto co-ordinate all departments of study, and he exposed himself to\r\ncriticism, just as President Eliot of Harvard did in his similar work\r\nfor his University; but I never heard him speak a disloyal word of any\r\nof his colleagues. No man could have advocated Imperialism as he did\r\nwithout making political enemies, and many a vigorous attack was made on\r\nhim by young Canadians; but I do not recall any spoken word or any\r\nprinted sentence of his that dragged his advocacy of Imperialism into\r\nthe realm of party politics or personal controversy. I know how true and\r\ngenerous he was to one of his friends who always found in him a\r\ncongenial fellow-worker in the things of the spirit. I also know how\r\nlarge a place he kept in his heart for the students,--rejoicing in\r\ntheir success, proud of their manly conduct, heart-sad over the tragedy\r\nof guilt and shame that befell any one of them. He had a warm heart,\r\nalthough he did not wear it on his sleeve for daws to peck at. To me as\r\nI go about the College yard he is a spiritual presence, summoning me to\r\ndo my best, to be accurate, fearless, loyal to the truth as I know the\r\ntruth, and loyal to those for whom I hold the truth in stewardship; and\r\nsuch a spiritual comrade he will be while memory lasts. My experience is\r\nthat of many of you who were fond of him and of whom he was fond, and\r\nour tribute to his memory, while quite unworthy, has at least, what he\r\nwould most desire, the merit of sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"Students of McGill, our former Principal is gone and we shall see his\r\nliving face no more. But the stimulus of his high example remains with\r\nus. It is fitting in conclusion that I repeat to you the inspiring and\r\nearnest words with which he ended his address to the students at the\r\nMemorial Service to his illustrious predecessor, Sir William Dawson,\r\ntwenty-one years ago:--'My closing words to the students of McGill,' he\r\nsaid, 'must be the expression of a confident hope that the record of Sir\r\nWilliam's life and work will be an abiding memory in this place. If you\r\nwill bear it about with you in your hearts, not only will you be kept\r\nfrom lip-service, slackness, half-heartedness in your daily duties, and\r\nfrom the graver faults of youth at which his noble soul would have\r\nrevolted, from dishonesty, sensuality and impurity in any form, but you\r\nwill be able, each in his sphere, to realise more fully the ideal of\r\ngoodness and truth, so that at the last you, too, may hear the voices\r\nwhispering, as they have now spoken to him, \"Well done, thou good and\r\nfaithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbott, Rev.
